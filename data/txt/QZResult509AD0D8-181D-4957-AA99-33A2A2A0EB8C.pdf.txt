ABSTRACT
Hyaluronan (HA) accumulates in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC),
but functional significance of HA in the aggressive phenotype remains unknown.
We used different models to investigate the effect of HA on PDAC cell motility
by wound healing and transwell migration assay. Changes in cell motility were
examined in 8 PDAC cell lines in response to inhibition of HA production by
treatment with 4-methylumbelliferone (4-MU) and to promotion by treatment with
12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA) or by co-culture with tumor-derived
stromal fibroblasts. We also investigated changes in cell motility by adding exogenous
HA. Additionally, mRNA expressions of hyaluronan synthases and hyaluronidases were
examined using real time RT-PCR. Inhibition of HA by 4-MU significantly decreased
the migration, whereas promotion of HA by TPA or co-culture with tumor-derived
fibroblasts significantly increased the migration of PDAC cells. The changes in HA
production by these treatments tended to be associated with changes in HAS3 mRNA
expression. Furthermore, addition of exogenous HA, especially low-molecular-weight
HA, significantly increased the migration of PDAC cells. These findings suggest that
HA stimulates PDAC cell migration and thus represents an ideal therapeutic target to
prevent invasion and metastasis.

signaling pathways always lead to chemoresistance of
patients with PDAC [2]. Therefore, it is important to
understand the molecular basis that leads to invasion,
dissemination, and metastasis of PDAC in order to provide
more effective therapy.
Hyaluronan (HA) is a major component of
extracellular matrix (ECM). In normal physiological
conditions, HA is involved in a variety of cellular
processes, including cell adhesion, migration, and
proliferation by interacting with specific cell surface
receptors including cluster of differentiation 44 (CD44)
and receptor for hyaluronic acid-mediated motility
(CD168/RHAMM) [3]. HA is synthesized by HA
synthases (HAS1, HAS2, and HAS3) and is degraded by
hyaluronidases (mainly HYAL1, HYAL2, and HYAL3) [4,
5]. Accumulating evidence suggests that HA is involved
in the aggressive phenotype of various malignant tumors
[6–8]. For example, HA has been shown to promote tumor
progression by enhancing cell proliferation, migration,

INTRODUCTION
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one
of the most aggressive forms of malignant neoplasm,
which is currently the 4th leading cause of cancer-related
deaths in western countries [1]. Several aspects contribute
to this poor survival. The most prominent biological and
pathological feature that characterizes pancreatic cancer
progression is its early invasion to surrounding structures
and metastasis to distant organs so that it often presents
clinically at a late stage in the course of the disease and
many patients lost the opportunity for curative surgical
resection. Currently, there are no laboratory markers
available to detect early stage PDAC. Painless jaundice,
often the presenting symptom, tends to occur very late.
Cancers of the tail of the pancreas do not involve the
bile duct system, and are often even more progressed at
the time of diagnosis. Additionally the complex tumor

invasion, metastasis, angiogenesis, and resistance to
chemotherapeutic agents [9, 10]. Interestingly, lowmolecular-weight HA (LMW-HA), rather than highmolecular-weight HA (HMW-HA), has been shown to be
specifically accumulated in cancer tissues and involved in
tumor progression [11–13].
Previous studies have shown increased expression
of HA in pancreatic cancer [14–16]. In our previous study,
we demonstrated overexpression and prognostic relevance
of HA and its regulators in PDAC [17]. Recently, forced
production and accumulation of extracellular HA by
hyaluronan synthase (HAS) 3 overexpression have
been shown to promote growth of PDAC tumor in mice
[18]. These findings suggest the importance of HA in
the progression of PDAC; however, only a few studies
addressed its effects on the aggressive tumor phenotype,
especially cell migration, in PDAC.
In the present study, we utilized different experimental
models to elucidate the effect of HA on the migratory ability
of PDAC cells. To modulate the endogenous HA production,
we treated PDAC cells with 4-methylumbelliferone (4-MU)
which is a potent inhibitor of HA synthesis [19, 20] and
12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA), a stimulator
of HA synthesis through activating protein kinase C [21,
22]. We also used another model of HA induction by co-

culturing PDAC cells with tumor-derived stromal fibroblasts
[23]. Finally, we investigated changes in cell motility by
directly adding exogenous HA to PDAC cells.

RESULTS
Effects of modulation of HA production on the
migration of PDAC cells
We first examined changes in migration of PDAC
cells by modulating the endogenous production of HA
using a known HA inhibitor, 4-MU (1000 μM), and a
HA stimulator, TPA (100 ng/ml). Both drugs had no
significant effects on cell viability (assessed by trypan blue
dye-exclusion test) when treated at these concentrations
(Supplementary Figure S1). Treatment with 4-MU resulted
in a significant decrease of HA concentration, whereas
treatment with TPA resulted in a significant increase of
HA concentration in conditioned media of all 8 PDAC
cell lines tested (Figure 1). However, treatment with
4-MU significantly inhibited the migration of PDAC
cells, whereas treatment with TPA significantly enhanced
the migration of PDAC cells, in both wound healing assay
(Supplementary Figure S2) and transwell cell migration
assay (Figure 2).

To elucidate the mechanism of HA modulation by
these drugs, we investigated the mRNA expression levels
of HA synthases, HAS1~3, and HA degrading enzymes,
HYAL1~3, in PDAC cells by real-time RT- PCR (Figure 3
and 4). Treatment with 4-MU led to a significant decrease
in HAS3 but significant increases in HYAL2 and HYAL3
mRNA expressions. On the other hand, treatment with TPA
tended to be associated with an increased mRNA expression
of HAS3 and a decreased mRNA expression of HYAL1.

PDAC cells. Co-culture of PDAC cells with tumor-derived
stromal fibroblasts derived from PDAC tissue resulted in
a robust increase in HA concentration in all PDAC cell
lines (Figure 5). In addition, the transwell migration assay
revealed that co-culture with tumor-derived fibroblasts
significantly increased the migration of PDAC cells in all
the tested cell lines (Figure 6).

sizes on PDAC cell migration

Effects of co-culture between PDAC cells
and tumor-derived stromal fibroblasts on HA

To gain more direct evidence for the effects of
HA on the migration, we added exogenous HMWHA (400~600 kDa) and LMW-HA (25~75 kDa) to
PDAC cells. In wound healing assay, the number of
migrating cells was significantly increased by HMW-HA

We used another model, the tumor-stromal co-culture
system, to determine the role of HA on the migration of

(200 μg/ml) in three cell lines (BxPC-3, KP-2, and AsPC1) and, more robustly, by LMW-HA (200 μg/ml) in all the
cell lines (Supplementary Figure S3). Similarly, transwell
migration assay revealed that the migrating cells were
significantly increased by HMW-HA in four cell lines
(BxPC-3, SUIT-2, KP-2, and AsPC-1) and by LMW-HA
in all the cell lines (Figure 7).

cell cultures. Inhibition of HA production by 4-MU
significantly decreased the migration, whereas promotion
of HA production by TPA or co-culture with tumorderived fibroblasts significantly enhanced the migration
of PDAC cells. Furthermore, addition of exogenous HA,
especially LMW-HA, significantly increased PDAC cell
motility. These findings suggest that HA stimulates PDAC
cell migration.
HA presents in a variety of molecular sizes,
ranging from a few kDa to 10, 000 kDa. In the present
study, we found that LMW-HA promotes PDAC cell
migration more potently than HMW-HA. HA has
different biological functions according to its molecular
sizes. For example, excessive HMW-HA inhibits tumor
growth [24, 25], whereas LMW-HA induces angiogenesis
[26] and enhances motility of tumor cells [27]. Recent

DISCUSSION
In the present study, we investigated the effects
of HA on PDAC cell motility. First, we used drugs (4MU and TPA) to modulate HA production. Second,
we used a co-culture system between PDAC cells and
tumor-derived fibroblasts that increases HA production.
Finally, we directly added different sizes of HA to PDAC

studies have also highlighted the importance of LMWHA, rather than HMW-HA, in invasion and metastasis
of cancers. Elevated serum levels of LMW-HA (smaller
than 50kDa), but not total HA, correlated with metastasis
in patients with breast cancer and decreasing the LMWHA levels inhibited the migration and invasion of breast
cancer cells [11]. Furthermore, in human colorectal cancer
tissues, accumulation of LMW-HA (ranging from 6 to 25
disaccharides) in tumor interstitial fluid correlated with
lymphatic invasion and lymph node metastasis [12].
These and our present findings suggest that LMW-HA,
rather than HMW-HA, contributes to tumor progression
by increasing cancer cell motility.
Tumor-stromal interactions can stimulate cancer
progression. This is particularly true in PDAC which is
characterized by a dense stroma called desmoplasia [28,
29]. In fact, the importance of tumor-stromal interactions
in the aggressive behavior of pancreatic cancer is
supported by several experimental evidences [30]. Among
the molecules involved in the tumor-stromal interactions,
HA is increasingly produced in co-culture between tumor
cells and fibroblasts [23]. Interestingly, a previous study
demonstrated that HAS2 mRNA expression is significantly
increased in PDAC cells in response to co-culture with

tumor-derived stromal fibroblasts [31]. In the present
study, co-culture between PDAC cells and tumor-derived
fibroblasts synergistically increased HA production into
the culture medium and enhanced PDAC cell migration.
These findings suggest that increased HA production in
this co-culture system might contribute, at least in part, to
the increased migration of PDAC cells.
Our present results may have therapeutic
implications. Because we found that treatment with 4-MU
robustly attenuates the migratory ability of PDAC cells,
inhibiting HA production could be an ideal therapeutic
strategy to prevent invasion and/or metastasis of
PDAC. In fact, inhibition of HA synthesis by treatment
with 4-MU, or its derivative 4-methylesculetin, has
demonstrated antitumor activity in a variety of cancers,
including PDAC [32–37]. Of particular importance,
4-MU (or hymecromone) is a dietary supplement for
improving liver health and can be administered orally
without any toxicities [38]. A recent study showed that
oral administration of 4-MU inhibits prostate cancer
development, growth, and metastasis by abrogating
HA signaling in treated transgenic adenocarcinoma
of the prostate (TRAMP) mice [39]. Another strategy
is the use of HA degrading enzyme for the treatment

of HA-rich cancers. Polyethylene glycol-conjugated
(pegylated) recombinant human hyaluronidase PH20
(PEGPH20) has been shown to deplete the stromal HA
and substantially augment the effect of chemotherapy in
PDAC animal models [40, 41]. The efficacy of PEGPH20,
in combination with other drugs, is currently being tested
for the treatment of advanced PDAC in clinical trials.
Thus, clinical application of these HA-targeted drugs for
the chemoprevention and treatment of PDAC is awaited.
In conclusion, we demonstrate that HA stimulates
PDAC cell migration and thus represents a therapeutic
target to prevent invasion and metastasis of this highly
aggressive neoplasm.

About 4 × 105 cells were cultured in six-well
plates to form confluent monolayers and then maintained
overnight in 2 ml complete medium. Then, the medium
was replaced with serum-free RPMI-1640 for 12h.
For wound healing assay, the monolayer was
wounded by scratching lines across the well with a
standard 200 μl pipette tip. After floating cells were
removed by gently washing with phosphate buffer
saline (PBS), fresh medias containing 1% FBS without
or with 4-MU (1000 μM), TPA (100 ng/ml), HWHHA (200  μg/ml), or LWH-HA (200 μg/ml) were added
to the wells and incubated for an additional 48h. Six
representative extents of cell migration near the wound
areas were photographed under light microscopy using a
5 × objective (Axio Vert 135 FL, Carl Zeiss, Germany)
at the time of scratching and after 48h. The supernatant
fractions of all the samples were aliquoted and stored at
−80°C until assayed for the determination of HA secretion.
For migration assay, the cells were harvested and
counted, and approximately 2 × 104 cells were seeded
in 100 μl medium with 1% FBS in the top chamber with
the non-coated membrane (24-well insert; 8-μm pore
size; BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) and
separately challenged without or with 4-MU (1000 μM),
TPA (100  ng/ml), HWH-HA (200 μg/ml), or LWH-HA
(200 μg/ml). 900 μl medium containing 10% serum was
used as a chemoattractant in the lower chamber and the
cells were allowed to migrate at 37°C in an atmosphere of
95% air and 5% CO2 for 48h.
All PDAC cells (2 × 105/ml) in 250µl serum-free
medium were separately seeded to the upper chamber
and 750µl serum-free medium was added into the lower
chamber as mono-culture, simultaneously, ike-f3 cells (1
× 105/ml) in 750µl serum-free medium were seeded to
the lower chamber as co-culture for 72h. The supernatant
fractions of mono-culture and co-culture were aliquoted
and stored at −80°C until assayed.
Non-migrating cells on the upper surface of the
membrane were removed with a cotton swab. Migrating
cells penetrated onto the lower surface of the membrane
were fixed with 70% methanol, stained with hematoxylin,
eosin, and air-dried. We counted the number of
migrating cells in six fields randomly selected at × 400
magnification.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture
Eight PDAC cell lines were used: AsPC-1, BxPC3, Panc-1, Capan-2, CFPAC1 (ATCC, Manassas, VA,
USA), SUIT-2, KP-2 (JCRB Cell Bank, Osaka, Japan),
and NOR-P1 (RIKEN BRC Cell Bank, Tsukuba, Ibaraki,
Japan). These cell lines were recently obtained when the
experiments were performed and their identities have
been routinely monitored by short tandem repeat (STR)
profiling. Primary fibroblasts (ike-f3) derived from PDAC
tissues were kind gifts from Kyushu University. All the
cell lines were maintained in Roswell Park Memorial
Institute (RPMI)-1640 medium (Life Technologies, Grand
Island, NY, USA) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS)
(Life Technologies) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Life
Technologies) at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere with
5% CO2.

Reagents
4-MU, TPA, HMW-HA (molecular weight ranging
from 400 to 600 kDa), and LMW-HA (molecular weight
ranging from 25 to 75 kDa) were purchased from Sigma
(St Louis, MO, USA).

Trypan blue dye-exclusion assay cellular
viability test
The effects of 4-MU (1000 μM) and TPA (100 ng/
ml) on cell viability were analyzed using trypan blue dyeexclusion (TBDE) assays as cytotoxic measurements.
After 48h, the untreated and treated cells were harvested
and stained with 4% trypan blue and then counted by the
LUNA™ automated cell counter (Logos Biosystems,
Annandale, VA, USA) according to the instructions of
the manufacturer. Cytotoxicity was determined from the
number of viable cells (no color) in treated samples as a
percentage of the untreated control.

ELISA-based assay for determination of HA
concentration
The concentration of HA in culture medium was
quantified by ELISA-based HA assay kit (R & D Systems,
Minneapolis, MN, USA) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
