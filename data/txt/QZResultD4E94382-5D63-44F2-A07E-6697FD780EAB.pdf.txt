Abstract
A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) SNP309 (T!G) in the
murine double minute 2 (MDM2) promoter creates a highaffinity Sp1 binding site and increases the expression of MDM2
mRNA and protein. Approximately 40% of the populations
harbor at least one variant allele and 12% to 17% are
homozygous G/G at codon 309. This MDM2 SNP increases
susceptibility to cancer and decreases the response of cancer
cells to certain forms of treatment, such as radiation therapy
and DNA-damaging drugs. Topoisomerase II (TopoII)–targeting agents are commonly used chemotherapeutic drugs with a
broad spectrum of activity. However, resistance to TopoII
poisons limits their effectiveness. We show that MDM2 SNP309
rendered a panel of cancer cell lines that are homozygous for
SNP309 selectively resistant (f10-fold) to certain TopoIItargeting chemotherapeutic drugs (etoposide, mitoxantrone,
amsacrine, and ellipticine). The mechanism underlying this
observation was Mdm2-mediated down-regulation of TopoII;
on drug exposure, MDM2 bound to TopoII and resulted in
decreased cellular enzyme content. Knockdown of MDM2 by
RNA interference stabilized TopoIIA and decreased resistance
to TopoII-targeting drugs. Thus, MDM2 SNP309 (T!G) may
represent a relatively common, previously unappreciated
determinant of drug sensitivity. Given the frequency of
SNP309 in the general population (40% in heterozygous T/G
and 12% in homozygous G/G condition), our observation may
have important implications for the individualization of
cancer chemotherapy. [Cancer Res 2007;67(12):5831–9]

Introduction
The status of the tumor suppressor protein, p53, affects the
progression of many cancers as well as the effectiveness of
chemotherapeutic drugs. Alterations in the p53 gene occur in
>50% of human malignancies, and cancer cells with mutant p53
protein are less sensitive to treatment with most DNA-damaging
agents than those with the wild-type (WT) protein (1–3). The murine
double minute 2 (MDM2) gene encodes a protein that is a key
component in the p53 signaling pathway. MDM2 is transcriptionally
activated by p53 (4) and regulates its content by targeting p53 for
ubiquitin-mediated degradation. Knockout of MDM2 in mice is

embryonic lethal (5). However, knockout of both p53 and MDM2
allows embryos to survive, suggesting that the primary function of
MDM2 is to regulate the actions of p53. MDM2 regulates the function
of p53 in several ways. For example, it is the ubiquitin E3 ligase for
p53 and targets its degradation by the proteasomal pathway (6);
MDM2 is responsible for the nuclear to cytoplasmic shuttling of p53,
thus inhibiting its function as a transcription factor (7). MDM2 also
binds p53 and inhibits transactivation (8). Although mutations in
MDM2 are rare, MDM2 protein is overexpressed in f5% to 10% of
human tumors (9). MDM2 overexpression can occur through gene
amplification or through transcriptional or post-transcriptional
mechanisms. MDM2 gene amplification has been observed in more
than one third of human sarcomas (10, 11).
MDM2 also controls the activity of several proteins involved in
cell cycle progression independently of p53. For example, MDM2
promotes the degradation of the phosphorylated retinoblastoma
protein (pRB; ref. 12) and p21 (13) and regulates their activities. In
addition, MDM2 interacts with the S phase-promoting factor, E2F1,
and increases its function (14). Because of its ability to determine
the fate of important regulators of the cell cycle, MDM2 might play
several roles in determining the sensitivity of cancer to chemotherapeutic agents. For example, Kondo et al. (15) showed that
overexpression of MDM2 resulted in expression of the MDR1 gene
product, P-glycoprotein (P-gp), in human glioblastoma cells,
resulting in decreased sensitivity to etoposide (VP-16) and
doxorubicin. In contrast, McKenzie et al. (16) reported that
MDM2 did not influence the ability of p53 to mediate sensitivity
to DNA-damaging agents, such as doxorubicin and actinomycin D,
in rhabdomyosarcoma cell lines engineered to overexpress p53.
Topoisomerase IIa (TopoIIa) is a nuclear enzyme that plays an
important role in DNA topology and repair following DNA damage.
Chen et al. (17) showed that TopoIIa is the target of several
antineoplastic drugs and that down-regulation of TopoIIa results in
resistance to several TopoII-targeting drugs, including VP-16. It has
been reported previously that VP-16 forms a noncleavable complex
with TopoIIa and this complex is subject to ubiquitin-mediated
degradation (18). Degradation of TopoIIa also occurs during
apoptosis induced by the adenovirus E1A protein (19). However,
the mechanism that facilitates ubiquitin-mediated degradation of
TopoIIa remains unknown.
Recently, Bond et al. (20) discovered a single nucleotide
polymorphism (SNP) in the MDM2 promoter that resulted in
overexpression of MDM2 and attenuation of p53 function. This SNP
(T!G change) is at the 309th nucleotide in the first intron of the
MDM2 gene and results in overexpression of MDM2 RNA and
protein. SNP309 occurs at a high frequency (40% heterozygous T/G
and 12% homozygous G/G) in the general population. In both
hereditary (Li-Fraumeni) and certain sporadic forms of cancers, the
presence of SNP309 resulted in earlier age of onset of cancer and

greater number of cancers than patients without this variant (20).
Cell lines homozygous for SNP309 had an altered apoptotic
response to VP-16 and that was attributable, at least in part, to the
attenuated action of p53.
Therefore, we investigated the effect of MDM2 SNP309 on
TopoII-targeting drugs. We observed that cancer cell lines
harboring MDM2 SNP309 were resistant to certain TopoII-targeting
drugs and that this could be attributable to changes in the rate of
degradation of TopoIIa.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines. The cancer cell lines, A875, T47D, Manca, CCF STTG1, Tera 2,
ML1, H460, Saos 2, and WT mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs), p53 knockout
MEFs, and p53 and MDM2 double knockout MEFs were generous gifts from
Dr. Arnold Levine (The Cancer Institute of New Jersey, Brunswick, NJ). A875,
Tera 2, and Saos 2 cells and MEFs were cultured in DMEM (Life
Technologies) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1%
penicillin-streptomycin (Life Technologies). T47D, Manca, CCF STTG1, ML1,
and H460 were cultured in RPMI 1640 (Life Technologies) supplemented
with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin-streptomycin.
Drugs, reagents, and antibodies. VP-16 (Sigma Chemical Co.) was
dissolved in ethanol ( final concentration of 1%). Cisplatin, camptothecin,
amsacrine, ellipticine, and mitoxantrone (Sigma Chemical) were dissolved in
DMSO. [3H]VP-16 (250 ACi) was obtained from Moravek Biochemicals. Primary
antibodies used for Western blotting were as follows: TopoIIa Ab-1 (Labvision),
MDM2 SMP14 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and p53 and monoclonal h-actin
clone AC15 (Sigma Chemical). The reactive proteins were visualized using
enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Antibodies used for immunoprecipitation were as follows: TopoII AB
(Topogen) and MDM2 SMP14. siGENOME SMARTpool MDM2 and siCONTROL nontargeting small interfering RNA (siRNA) 1 (Dharmacon) were
transfected using Oligofectamine reagent (Invitrogen).
Cell proliferation assay. Cells indicated were plated in 96-well tissue
culture plates, allowed to attach overnight, and then treated with increasing
doses of VP-16, camptothecin, cisplatin, mitoxantrone, amsacrine, or
ellipticine for 48 h. Twenty-five microliters of 5 mg/mL 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) in PBS were then added
to each well, and cells were incubated at 37jC for 4 h. Formazan crystals
were dissolved in DMSO. Absorbances were determined at 570 nm using a
Dynatech MR5000 plate reader. Viability was expressed as a percentage of
control by dividing the absorbance of each treated sample by the average of

the untreated controls. All the experiments were repeated four times and in
triplicates. IC50 was defined as the concentration of drug that decreased cell
viability by 50%.
Immunoblot analysis. Cell lines were plated at 2  106 cells in 60-mm
dishes. After the respective treatments, cells were harvested and lysed in
lysis buffer containing 50 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1% sodium
deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100, 150 mmol/L NaCl, 10 Ag/mL leupeptin,
10 Ag/mL pepstatin, 20 Ag/mL aprotinin, 10 mmol/L sodium PPi, 50 mmol/L
sodium fluoride, and 500 Amol/L sodium orthovanadate or in alkaline lysis
buffer as described previously. The lysates were pulsed four to six times with
2.5 W using a VirSonic 60 VirTis Sonicator. Protein concentrations were
determined by the method of Bradford using the Bio-Rad protein assay
reagent (Bio-Rad). Fifty micrograms of protein were loaded onto 6% SDSPAGE gels followed by transfer to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher &
Schuell). The blots were assayed for the expression of TopoIIa, MDM2, and
p53 and enhanced by chemiluminescence detection (ECL). h-Actin served as
loading control.
Reverse transcription-PCR. Cells were plated at 2  106 cells in 60-mm
dishes and treated with 0, 0.1, and 1 mmol/L VP-16 for 24 h. Total RNA was
extracted by Trizol (Invitrogen) method according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. The RNA yield and purity were determined spectrophotometrically at 260 to 280 nm. The primers used for reverse transcription-PCR
(RT-PCR) were as follows: 5¶-GTCTTCGGGCCTGAGCTGTCG-3¶ and
5¶-GGTTGTAGAATTAAGAATAGC-3¶ for TopIIa and 5¶-GGTCGGAGTCAACGGATTTG-3¶ and 5¶-ATGAGCCCCAGCCTTCTCCAT-3¶ for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH).
Drug accumulation, uptake, and efflux. Drug accumulation was
determined by seeding 2  105cells onto 24-well plates. After 24 h, cells were
washed with serum-free medium and incubated with 5 Amol/L [3H]VP-16
for 2 h. The reaction was stopped by adding ice-cold PBS and the cells were
lysed immediately with 1% SDS for 30 min. The accumulation of the drug
was measured by liquid scintillation counting.
Cell cycle analysis. Cells were plated and treated with the respective
agents for the indicated times. Adherent and supernatant cells were
collected, generated into a single-cell suspension, washed with PBS, and
fixed with ice-cold 70% ethanol. Cells were then washed with PBS and
treated with 5 AL of 1 mg/mL propidium iodide in 400 AL PBS for 30 min at
room temperature. Propidium iodide incorporation was measured on a
Becton Dickinson FACScan analyzer. Cells in sub-G0, G1, S, and G2-M were
identified and quantified using quadrant statistics.
Immunoprecipitation. Cell lines were plated at 2  106 cells in T75
dishes. After the respective treatments, cells were harvested and lysed in
lysis buffer containing 50 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1% sodium
deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100, 150 mmol/L NaCl, 10 Ag/mL leupeptin,
10 Ag/mL pepstatin, and 20 Ag/mL aprotinin. The lysates were incubated
with protein A plus G Sepharose beads and the respective antibody or
isotype control overnight at 4jC. The beads were then washed thrice with
PBS and boiled with 1 Laemmli buffer. The extracted proteins were
loaded onto 6% SDS-PAGE gels followed by transfer to nitrocellulose
membranes. The blots were assayed for the expression of TopoIIa or MDM2
and enhanced by chemiluminescence detection (ECL).
Confocal imaging. Cells were plated at 2  106 cells in chamber slides
and treated with 5 mmol/L VP-16 for 2 h. Cells were fixed for 20 min in 1:1
acetone/methanol at 20jC and treated with 5% bovine serum albumin to
prevent nonspecific binding. Antibodies used were as follows: 1:100 antiMDM2 (SMP14) and 1:100 anti-TopoIIa (Ab-1). The samples were then
washed thrice with PBS and incubated with Cy3-labeled antirabbit IgG and
FITC-labeled antimouse IgG. After washing, samples were examined using a
confocal laser scanning microscope (Zeiss LSM 510 META).

Results
Cell lines homozygous for SNP309 have decreased sensitivity
to TopoII-targeting drugs. It was reported previously that cell
lines homozygous for MDM2 SNP309 had a decreased apoptotic
response to DNA-damaging agents, such as VP-16 and gamma
irradiation (20). We sought to determine whether this differential

induction of apoptosis in cells homozygous for MDM2 SNP309 and
those with WT MDM2 translated into differences in drug sensitivity
to various classes of DNA-damaging agents. A panel of cell lines
derived from various cell types and with varying status of p53
(Table 1) were treated with TopoII-targeting and topoisomerase I
(TopoI)–targeting drugs and platinating agents. As shown in Fig. 1,
cells homozygous for SNP309 were f10-fold resistant to TopoIItargeting drugs but were not resistant to other types of DNAdamaging agents (Fig. 1A–C); this effect was independent of the
status of p53. SNP309 conferred resistance to multiple TopoIItargeting drugs, including VP-16, mitoxantrone, amsacrine, and
ellipticine (Fig. 1D). In contrast, sensitivity to TopoI-targeting drugs
and platinating agents was independent of MDM2 SNP309 but
dependent on the status of p53; cell lines with WT p53 were more
sensitive to DNA-damaging agents than those with mutant or null
p53. Furthermore, MDM2 SNP309 had no effect on the sensitivity to
non–DNA-damaging drugs, such as antimicrotubule agents in the
select cell lines used (Supplementary Tables S1 and S2).
TopoIIA decreases in cells homozygous for SNP309 following treatment with VP-16. To explore the mechanism of
resistance to TopoII-targeting drugs in cells homozygous for
SNP309, we first addressed the possibility that differences were
due to the expression of drug efflux proteins, such as P-gp, MRP1,
or BCRP. As shown in Fig. 2A, there was no difference in expression
of these proteins between cell lines homozygous for SNP309 and
those with WT MDM2. There was also no difference in
accumulation of VP-16 between cells homozygous for SNP309
and those with WT MDM2 (Fig. 2B). Hence, the difference in

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (12). June 15, 2007

sensitivity to TopoII drugs was not attributable to changes in drug
accumulation. We then compared the expression of TopoIIa in cell
lines homozygous for SNP309 and those with WT MDM2 following
exposure to VP-16 using concentrations of VP-16 and timed
exposure that caused <15% cell kill. Figure 3 shows that treatment
with 1 Amol/L VP-16 for 24 h decreased TopoIIa protein in cells
homozygous for SNP309 but not in cells with WT MDM2 (Fig. 3A
and B). This effect was independent of p53 status and not
associated with decreased TopoIIa mRNA (Fig. 3C).
TopoIIa expression varies during the cell cycle. It is expressed
minimally during G1 and S and increases during transition to G2-M.
Alterations in cell cycle due to overexpression of MDM2 therefore
could account for reduced TopoIIa in cells homozygous for
SNP309. Therefore, we compared cell cycle distribution in cells with
WT MDM2 to those homozygous for SNP309 before and after
exposure to VP-16. We found that exposure to VP-16 in cells
homozygous for SNP309 showed no evidence of apoptosis and
resulted in accumulation of cells in S and G2-M, the two phases of
the cell cycle where TopoIIa expression is the highest (Supplementary Figs. S1 and S2). Thus, cell cycle alterations could not
account for the lowered TopoIIa expression or resistance to VP-16
in cells homozygous for SNP309.
Reciprocal relationship between TopoIIA and MDM2 following treatment with VP-16. To examine the effect of VP-16 on
TopoIIa, MDM2, and p53, we treated A875 cells (homozygous for
SNP309) with 1 Amol/L VP-16 for 24 h and used alkaline lysis to
dissociate TopoIIa from DNA. Figure 4A shows that TopoIIa
decreased by 1 h following treatment with VP-16. The decreased
TopoIIa coincided with increased expression of MDM2. p53
expression increased after 2 to 3 h of exposure, suggesting that
p53 transcriptional repression was not likely to be responsible for
the decreased TopoIIa.
To further explore this association between TopoIIa, MDM2,
and p53, primary MEFs WT (p53+/+; MDM2+/+), knockout
for p53 (p53/; MDM2+/+), or knockout for p53 and MDM2
(p53/; MDM2/) were treated with increasing doses of VP-16
for 24 h. As shown in Fig. 4B, treatment with VP-16 reduced the
cellular content of TopoIIa in cells, in which both p53 and MDM2
were deleted (p53/; MDM2+/+). In contrast, VP-16 did not downregulate TopIIa in cells depleted of p53 alone (p53/; MDM2+/+)
or in WT cells (p53+/+; MDM2+/+), suggesting that MDM2 was
responsible, directly or indirectly, for the down-regulation of
TopoIIa following exposure to VP-16 (Fig. 4B). This observation
was strengthened by the finding that knockout of both p53 and
MDM2 resulted in IC50 values following exposure to VP-16 that
were intermediate between those for WT and knockout for p53
alone cells (Fig. 4C).
Knockdown of MDM2 stabilizes TopoIIA and decreases
resistance to TopoII-targeting drugs. If MDM2 was responsible
for the down-regulation of TopoIIa following treatment with VP-16,
we reasoned that depletion of MDM2 with siRNA would prevent
the decrease of MDM2 and restore drug sensitivity. As shown in
Fig. 5A, knockdown of MDM2 in untreated cells had minimal effect
on TopoIIa. Following treatment with VP-16, TopoIIa decreased in
control cells and in cells treated with nontargeting siRNA. In
contrast, VP-16 failed to decrease TopoIIa in cells depleted of
MDM2 with siRNA. We next examined the effect of MDM2 siRNA
on sensitivity to VP-16. As shown in Fig. 5B, silencing of MDM2
increased sensitivity to VP-16 by 2-fold. We observed this change in
sensitivity in A875 and Manca cells, which are both homozygous for
SNP309 (Fig. 5B). In contrast, there was no change in sensitivity to

VP-16 in cell lines with WT MDM2 following treatment with MDM2
siRNA (Fig. 5C). These results suggest that the increased expression
of MDM2 in cells homozygous for SNP309 is responsible for
lowering TopoIIa after treatment with VP-16.
MDM2 interacts with TopoIIA in vivo. MDM2 is known to
interact with several proteins and regulate their activity. To
determine whether MDM2 and TopoIIa interact, we did coimmunoprecipitations using whole-cell lysates and antibodies specific for
MDM2 or TopoIIa. As shown in Fig. 6A, antibodies against MDM2
coimmunoprecipitated TopoIIa. Furthermore, treatment of cells
with VP-16 increased the association of TopoIIa with MDM2.
Reciprocal immunoprecipitation with TopoIIa yielded similar
results. Pretreatment with the proteasome inhibitor, MG132,
enhanced the association of MDM2 with TopoIIa (Fig. 6A).
The interaction between TopoIIa and MDM2 was further
investigated by confocal imaging. In untreated cells, MDM2 showed
a cytoplasmic and perinuclear distribution, whereas TopoIIa was
predominantly nuclear (Fig. 6B). Following exposure to VP-16,
MDM2 increased in the cytoplasm where it colocalized with
TopoIIa (Fig. 6C), indicating shuttling of TopoIIa by MDM2 from
nucleus to the cytoplasm.

Discussion
Since the sequencing of the human genome and the subsequent
identification of f4.5 million SNPs, there have been considerable
efforts to link a SNP phenotype to sensitivity to certain
chemotherapeutic drugs. The results presented in this report
support the concept that a SNP in the MDM2 promoter results in
resistance to a specific class of chemotherapeutic agent (i.e., the
TopoII-targeting drugs). The increased expression of MDM2 in cell

lines homozygous for SNP309 results in lowered TopoII, the target
of TopoII drugs, following drug exposure. Decreased expression of
TopoIIa was shown previously to be a mechanism of resistance to
TopoII-targeting drugs (21, 22). Our data extend those of Bond
et al. (20) and provide a mechanistic basis for the finding that
MDM2 SNP309 results in attenuation of the response to VP-16.
Decreased sensitivity to TopoII-targeting drugs might be
attributed to one of several mechanisms. For example, increased
expressions of drug efflux proteins, such as P-gp, MRP1, or BCRP,
could result in decreased drug accumulation and increased
resistance to certain TopoII-targeting agents. Overexpression of
MDM2 has been reported to result in increased expression of the
MDR1 gene and P-gp in human glioblastoma cells, thus resulting in
resistance to VP-16 and doxorubicin (15). However, the role of
MDM2 in sensitivity to TopoII-targeting agents is controversial. For
example McKenzie et al. (16) showed that MDM2 does not
influence sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents. We found that
overexpression of MDM2 in cell lines homozygous for SNP309 does
not result in overexpression of drug efflux proteins, such as P-gp,
MRP1, or BCRP (Fig. 2A). There is also no significant difference in
accumulation of [3H]VP-16 between cell lines with WT MDM2 and
those homozygous for SNP309 (Fig. 2B). Thus, the involvement of
drug efflux in difference in sensitivities to TopoII-targeting agents
in this context can be excluded. Although resistance to VP-16
mediated by MDM2 SNP309 is moderate (10-fold) in comparison
with other acquired mechanisms of drug resistance, this SNP is a
germ-line mutation and therefore would also affect the sensitivity
of normal cells to certain drugs. The 10-fold increase in drug
resistance produced by SNP309 would have major implications in
the clinic, where cytotoxic drugs, like topoisomerase-targeting
agents, are administered at or near the maximum tolerated dose.

TopoII-targeting agents exert their effect by ‘‘poisoning’’ TopoIIa,
a nuclear enzyme that modifies the tertiary structure of DNA.
Hence, cells with lower TopoIIa or with altered function of
TopoIIa due to mutations are resistant to TopoII-targeting drugs
(21–23). We show that following exposure to concentrations of
VP-16 that cause less than 15% cell killing, cell lines homozygous
for SNP309 down-regulate TopoIIa more efficiently than cell lines
with WT MDM2 (Fig. 3A and B). This pointed to a previously
unappreciated relationship between MDM2 and TopoIIa. It has
been shown that p53 can transcriptionally repress TopoIIa (24).
However, we found that the resistance to TopoII-targeting agents in
cell lines homozygous for SNP309 occurs independent of p53 status
(Fig. 3A and B). Moreover, the lowered TopoIIa protein is seen
without changes in its mRNA (Fig. 3C).
TopoIIa protein expression varies during the cell cycle (25).
Therefore, we also ruled out the possibility that the decreased
sensitivity to TopoII-targeting drugs was due to decreased TopoIIa
expression in SNP309 cells due to cell cycle changes. In most cells,
the expression of TopoIIa becomes detectable by late G1 phase and
peaks in G2-M. MDM2 is known to play an important role in
progression through the cell cycle (10). It controls the fate of
several key proteins in the cell cycle, such as p53 (8) and Rb (12), by
promoting proteasomal-mediated degradation of these two
proteins. However, MDM2 is also known to enhance the function
of S phase-promoting factor E2F1 (13). It was conceivable
that following DNA damage with VP-16, overexpression of MDM2

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (12). June 15, 2007

in cell lines homozygous for SNP309 could result in altered cell
cycle distribution that would favor a lower cellular content of
TopoIIa. In contrast, we observed that in cell lines homozygous for
SNP309, following exposure to 1 Amol/L VP-16, most cells
accumulate in G2-M phase where TopoIIa expression is maximum
(Supplementary Figs. S1 and S2).
Having ruled out several explanations for our observations, we
focused on the possible regulation of TopoIIa by MDM2. We
found that VP-16–mediated repression of TopoIIa is dependent on
the increased expression of MDM2. Thus, when MDM2 is depleted
by siRNA, the levels of TopoIIa do not change following exposure
to VP-16 and sensitivity to the drug is increased compared with
SNP209 cells treated with nontargeting siRNA controls (Fig. 5).
The lack of total reversal of VP-16 resistance is likely due to
the inability to completely restore TopoIIa activity by knockdown
of MDM2, or MDM2 silencing-induced increases in expression of
p53, which is known to transcriptionally repress TopoIIa expression (26).
It is known that MDM2 shuttles between the nucleus and the
cytoplasm (27, 28). For example, Freedman and Levine (27) showed
that the regulation of p53 level by MDM2 requires the nuclear
export activity of MDM2. We show that a physical interaction
occurs between MDM2 and TopoIIa. We find that MDM2 and
TopoIIa coimmunoprecipitate and colocalize in cancer cells
(Fig. 6). The cellular distribution of TopoIIa and MDM2 changes
following exposure to VP-16 when the two proteins are located

within the cytoplasm. These results suggest that export of TopoIIa
by MDM2 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm might be responsible
for the down-regulation of TopoIIa. Furthermore, the association is
enhanced following treatment with VP-16 (Fig. 6A). MG132, a

proteasome inhibitor, also enhances the association between the
two proteins, suggesting that the increased MDM2 due to
inhibition of the ubiquitin pathway might lead to increased
association between MDM2 and TopoIIa (Fig. 6A).

Figure 5. siRNA to MDM2 prevents loss of TopoIIa following treatment with VP-16 and increases sensitivity to TopoII-targeting drugs. A, A875 cells were treated
with 100 nmol/L siRNA to MDM2, Oligofectamine control, or 100 nmol/L nontargeting siRNA for 24 h. Cells were then treated with VP-16 for 24 h and assayed for
expression of TopoIIa and MDM2 by Western blot. The blot is representative of three independent experiments. B, A875 and Manca cells were treated with VP-16
for 48 h following depletion of MDM2 by siRNA or with the appropriate controls as described in Materials and Methods. MTT cell proliferation assay was done to
determine viability following treatment with VP-16 in cells treated with Oligofectamine control, 100 nmol/L nontargeting (NT) siRNA, or 100 nmol/L siRNA to MDM2. Data
are representative of four independent experiments. C, H460 cells were treated with VP-16 for 48 h following depletion of MDM2 by siRNA or with the appropriate
controls as described in Materials and Methods. MTT cell proliferation assay was done to determine viability following treatment with VP-16 in cells treated with
Oligofectamine control, 100 nmol/L nontargeting siRNA, or 100 nmol/L siRNA to MDM2. Data are representative of four independent experiments.

Figure 6. MDM2 associates with
TopIIa in vivo. A, coimmunoprecipitation
of MDM2 and TopoIIa was done in
whole-cell extracts of A875 cells following
exposure to 5 Amol/L VP-16 for 6 h or with
prior sensitization to 5 Amol/L MG132
followed by 5 Amol/L VP-16 for 6 h.
Immunoprecipitation (IP ) was done with
antibodies to MDM2 (SMP14), TopoIIa
(Ab-1), or mouse or rabbit IgG and followed
by Western blotting with the reciprocal
antibody. The blot is representative of three
independent experiments. B and C,
confocal microscopy was done using a
Zeiss LSM 510 meta microscope before
and 2 h after treatment of A875 cells with
5 Amol/L VP-16. The cells were then fixed
and stained with FITC-labeled anti-MDM2
antibody and Cy3-labeled anti-TopoIIa
antibody. Results are representative of
three identical experiments.

The transcription factor Sp1 is known to activate both TopoIIa
and MDM2. It has been shown previously that increased expression
of MDM2 in cell lines homozygous for SNP309 is due to increased
binding of Sp1 to the MDM2 promoter. Johnson-Pais et al. (29)
have shown that MDM2 binding to Sp1 prevents its specific DNA
binding to other sequences. Further, MDM2 and TopoIIa commonly interact with several proteins, such as Rb.
The precise mechanism by which the association of MDM2 with
TopoIIa leads to down-regulation of the drug target remains
unclear. It is likely that post-translational events following DNA
damage with VP-16 are important. For example, following exposure
to VP-16, several kinases, such as ATM, phosphorylate MDM2 and
TopoIIa. Post-translational modification, such as phosphorylation
of the androgen receptor, enhances degradation by MDM2 (30). In
addition, ATM-mediated phosphorylation of Mdmx by ATM
mediates its degradation by MDM2 following DNA damage (31).

There are also instances of MDM2-mediated degradation of
proteins independent of ubiquitination. MDM2 interacts with p21
and facilitates its interaction with C8 subunit of 20S proteasome
independent of p53 and ubiquitination (13).
In this study, we confirm and extend the observations of Bond
et al. (20) and strengthen the correlation between a SNP phenotype
and sensitivity to chemotherapeutic agents. Given the frequency of
SNP309 in the general population, these data may have important
implications for the individualization of cancer chemotherapy.
