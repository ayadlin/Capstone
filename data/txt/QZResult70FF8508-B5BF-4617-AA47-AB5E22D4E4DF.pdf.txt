BACKGROUND: African-American women have increased breast cancer mortality compared with white women. Diagnostic and treatment gaps may contribute to this disparity. METHODS: In this retrospective, longitudinal cohort study,
Southern US health plan claims data and linked medical charts were used to identify racial disparities in the diagnoses, treatment, and mortality of commercially insured women with newly diagnosed breast cancer. White women (n ¼
476) and African-American women (n ¼ 99) with newly diagnosed breast cancer were identified by breast cancer
claims codes (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification codes 174, 233.0, 238.3,
and 239.3) between January 2000 and December 2004. Race, diagnoses (breast cancer stage, estrogen/progesterone receptor [ER/PR]-positive status), treatment (breast-conserving surgery, antiestrogen therapy, and chemotherapy interruption or reduction), and all-cause mortality were assessed from medical charts. Multivariate regression
analyses were adjusted for age, geography, and socioeconomic status to test the association of race with diagnoses/
treatment. RESULTS: White women were older (P < .001) and had higher rates of diagnosis at stage 0/I (55.2% vs
38.4%; P < .05) than African-American women. More white women had positive ER/PR status (75% vs 56% AfricanAmerican; P ¼ .001) and received antiestrogen therapy if they were positive (37.2% vs 27.3% African-American; P <
.001). White women received slightly more breast-conserving surgery and chemotherapy dose modification than African-American women (P value nonsignificant). African-American women had a higher mortality rate (8.1%) than white
women (3.6%; P ¼ .06). In adjusted analyses, African-American women were diagnosed at later stages (odds ratio,
1.71; P ¼ .02), and white women received more antiestrogen therapy (odds ratio, 2.1; P ¼ .03). CONCLUSIONS: Disparities in medical care among patients with newly diagnosed breast cancer were evident between African-American
women and white women despite health plan insurance coverage. Interventions that address the gaps identified are

The importance of minimizing racial disparities in healthcare is evidenced by the number of broad-based initiatives
in the United States. Such initiatives include efforts by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality,1 the US.

of Clinical Oncology Advisory Group on Health Disparities.3 Estimates are that the breast cancer mortality rate is
33% higher in African-American women than in white women.4-7 Disparities that may increase the risk of mortality
in African-American women include a later disease stage at diagnosis,8,9 higher rates of negative estrogen receptor

white women to receive indicated adjuvant therapies,
including radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and antiestrogen therapy.7,12,13,15,16 Although racial disparities in
breast cancer diagnosis and treatment have been documented previously, the majority of previous studies did
not specify the type of insurance coverage used8,11 or were
conducted mostly in Medicaid/Medicare populations,1214
and both of those conditions ignore a segment of the
population with racial differences but equivalent commercial insurance coverage.
In this retrospective cohort analysis, we identified
gaps in medical care between African-American women
and white women with newly diagnosed breast cancer
who were covered by the same health plan in the southeastern United States. We hypothesized that race was associated with differences in stage of cancer at diagnosis, use
of antiestrogen therapy, use of breast-conserving surgery,
chemotherapy dose interruption or reduction, and rates of
mortality before and after adjustment for age, socioeconomic status (SES), and the inclusion of measures, as
appropriate for geography, body mass index (BMI), stage
of cancer at diagnosis, ER/progesterone receptor (PR)positive status, use of blood growth factor, and presence
of anemia or neutropenia.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Data Sources
Patient data were obtained from an administrative medical claims database that was created using data from a large
commercial health plan located in the southeastern
United States. Claims data were used to identify linked
medical charts and to measure age, use of pharmaceutical
agents, and comorbid medical conditions present at the
time of breast cancer diagnosis; all other measures presented in these analyses were extracted from medical chart
data. A limited data set, as defined by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) of
1996, was used for these analyses. HealthCore, Inc. (Wilmington, Del) had all HIPAA-required business associate
and data-use agreements in place before conducting the
research. A HIPAA waiver of authorization was obtained
from a central institutional review board allowing the use
of Protected Health Information to obtain medical charts.
Patient Identification From Medical
Claims Data
Medical claims between January 1, 2000 and December 31,
2004 (intake period) for women in the HealthCore Inte-

194

grated Research Database were reviewed to identify women
who had at least 2 International Classification of Diseases,
Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9) diagnosis
codes (primary or secondary) for breast cancer (ICD-9 codes
174, 233.0x, 238.3x, and 239.3x). The date of the first medical claim for breast cancer was defined as the ‘‘index diagnosis date.’’ Patients were required to have continuous plan
enrollment for 12 months before and 6 months after the
index diagnosis date to allow exclusion based on prior cancer
diagnosis or prior cancer treatment, and they had to complete follow-up of treatment patterns for at least 6 months after index diagnosis date. We targeted patients who had
newly diagnosed breast cancer for this study and excluded
women who had either a medical claim for any type of cancer within 180 days before the index diagnosis date or a medical or pharmacy claim for cancer treatment (ie, surgical,
radiation, or chemotherapy) in the 90 days before the index
diagnosis date. Patients were followed longitudinally from
their index diagnosis date until the earlier date of their end of
eligibility or August 31, 2005 (mean follow-up, 27.4
months; standard deviation, 16.1 months).
Physician Identification From
Patient Medical Claims
Once patients with newly diagnosed breast cancer were
identified, the physician(s) who provided surgery or chemotherapeutic care was identified by the physician’s tax identification codes from claims data. The physician with the
highest amount of claim dates for treatment of each patient
was contacted and recruited through the HealthCore Integrated Research Network. Chart abstraction was performed
by nurses who were trained in standardized data-collection
techniques. Data from the medical charts were extracted
through completion of a prepared computerized dataextraction tool. We targeted high-minority areas of the
southeastern state covered by the health plan. We used the
patient and physician office zip codes that matched regions
that had 50% minorities according to 2000 census tract
data so that we could measure diagnostic, treatment pattern, and mortality differences between white women and
African-American women. No greater than 8% of charts
were obtained from any single practice to prevent skewing
data toward practice patterns from a particular group.
Medical Chart Data
Of the 3017 women who were identified from administrative claims data with newly diagnosed breast cancer
during the study intake period as eligible for medical chart
abstraction, we obtained medical charts from 766

patients. In total, 170 patients (22.2%) were missing data
on race after chart abstraction. Of those patients who had
race data (n ¼ 596 women), 79.8% were white (n ¼ 476),
16.6% were African-American (n ¼ 99), 1.5% were Asian
(n ¼ 9), 0.5% were Latino (n ¼ 3), and 1.5% were of
‘‘other’’ race (n ¼ 9). Because of small sample sizes for the
other racial cohorts, analytic comparisons were made only
between white patients and African-American patients.
The information obtained from the medical charts
included patient race, cancer stage at diagnosis, positive
ER/PR status, cancer treatment received (ie, breast-conserving surgery, chemotherapy dose interruption or reduction, radiation therapy, antiestrogen therapy), and
mortality. We also collected data on complications and/or
treatment received because of illness or therapy and on
notation of follow-up care in the medical chart. Race was
not always available in the medical chart, as mentioned
above. We summarized demographic characteristics for
patients with other or undocumented race (text only) but
otherwise excluded them from additional analyses. The
exclusion of patients based on unknown race was based on
several factors: These women may differ inherently from
women with known race inasmuch as they may have more
missing data overall, they may have been treated differently overall, or they may have other characteristics that
confound our ability to assess their risk accurately. All of
the multivariate models conducted in our analyses
included 476 white women and 99 African-American
women with newly diagnosed breast cancer.
Outcomes Measures
The main outcomes for these analyses were 1) breast cancer
stage at diagnosis, 2) use of antiestrogen therapy, 3) use of
breast-conserving surgery or lumpectomy, 4) chemotherapy dose modification (ie, an interruption or reduction),
and 5) rates of all-cause mortality. Breast cancer stage at diagnosis was defined as stages 0, I, II, III, and IV according
to the 2003 National Comprehensive Cancer Network
guidelines.17 All other outcomes were assessed based on
medical chart review from the date of first chemotherapy,
antiestrogen treatment, or surgery to the end of medical
chart notation. Antiestrogen therapy was defined as the use
of hormone therapy (tamoxifen, fulvestrant, toremifene) or
aromatase inhibitors (anastrazole, exemestane, letrozole).
Additional Measures

betes mellitus, renal disease), and concurrent medication
use (contraceptives/hormone-replacement therapy and
antihypertensive, antihyperlipidemic, diuretic, and corticosteroid medications) at baseline were collected using
claims data for the chart-abstracted cohort. BMI (in kg/
m2) was calculated using weight (kg) and height (m),
which were collected from medical chart review. Patient
SES was based on average household income using zip
code estimates from 2000, which, with a Georgia-specific
cost-of-living adjustment from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (available at: http://www.bls.gov accessed November
2008), were adjusted to 2006 figures and divided into
quintiles. Rural-Urban Commuting Area (RUCA) codes
were defined using patient’s household zip codes and were
used in multivariate modeling to adjust for geographic
area (7% rural, 16% suburban, 77% urban).
Treatment received

We collected data on cancer-specific treatment
received (surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and
hormone therapy), adverse events, supportive care, and
oncologist follow-up communication with primary care
physicians (PCPs). Because we abstracted oncologist’s
medical charts, data were more specific for therapy provided by oncologists (eg, chemotherapy) than for therapy
provided by radiologists. Chemotherapy dosing for the
first 8 cycles was recorded as intended, and dosing delays
and reductions that actually were received and documented were captured. Because we were unable to determine what the protocol-specified regimen was in most
cases, we designated the initial dose as the ‘‘intended’’
dose. A chemotherapy dose delay was defined as a difference 7 days between intended and actual treatment
time, and a dose reduction was defined as a dose difference
15% between the intended dose and the actual dose
received. Chemotherapy dose reductions were compared
by categorical age (ages <40 years, 40 to 49 years, and
50 years), race, stage at diagnosis, SES quintile, and
BMI. We measured adverse events and supportive care
that began during cancer treatment as follows: nausea/
vomiting or antiemetic treatment, menopausal symptoms
or hormone-replacement therapy, pain medication or
management, hair loss, fever or infection, erythrocyte
growth factor administration, depression or antidepressant medication, anxiety or anxiolytic medication, intravenous fluids, and referral for mental healthcare. The use
of white blood cell growth factor was infrequent and was
not included in these analyses. We also assessed notation
of follow-up communication with the PCP.

Statistical Analysis
All analyses in which race was the exposure variable
were compared using only white patients and AfricanAmerican patients. In addition, the receipt of a chemotherapy dose modification (delay or reduction) was used
to compare categorical age, race, stage at diagnosis, and
SES. Continuous measures (age, BMI) were compared
using standard t tests. Analyses of categorical measures
were conducted using Pearson chi-square tests. Multivariate regression modeling was conducted to measure the
association of race with stage of cancer at diagnosis, use of
antiestrogen therapy, breast-conserving surgery, and mortality rates only if race was associated with these outcomes
in unadjusted bivariate analyses. Covariates that were
included in every model were age and SES quintiles, which
were treated as linear covariates (the comparison group
was the fifth, or highest, quintile). Geography (RUCA; the
comparison group was urban) was included in the regression model that analyzed stage of cancer at diagnosis. Stage
of cancer at diagnosis (the comparison group was stage 0)
was included as a covariate in modeling the use of antiestrogen therapy, the rate of chemotherapy dose modification, and rates of mortality. Use of erythrocyte growth
factor, BMI, and the presence of anemia or neutropenia
were included as additional covariates in modeling chemotherapy dose modification. Stage of cancer at diagnosis was
modeled using ordinal logistic regression modeling. All
other outcomes were binary and were modeled using binary logistic regression. Statistical analyses were performed
using SAS, version 9.1 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC).

Role of the Funding Source
This work was supported by a grant from Amgen Inc.,
Thousand Oaks, California. Funding was provided specifically for the collection of treatment data for patients newly
diagnosed with breast cancer from claims data and medical
chart review for women from the same US health plan. Collaboration with Amgen Inc. and the health plan was overseen
by HealthCore, Inc. and was ongoing until project completion. Although preparation of this article was funded by
Amgen Inc. with contribution from health plan representatives, the data reported here have not been modified in any
way based on funding source or health plan collaboration.

Women with other or undocumented race were
assessed for baseline characteristics only (data not shown).
These women were 52  9.9 years of age on average.
Hypertension was their most prevalent comorbid condition (26.2%), and all other medical conditions ranged in
prevalence from 1.6% (renal disease) to 5.8% (osteoarthritis). Rates of medication use were as follows: 36.6%
received contraceptives/hormone replacement therapy,
26.2% received antihypertensive medications, 13.1%
received antihyperlipidemic medications, 10.5% received
diuretics, and 6.3% received corticosteroids.

surgery was slightly less frequent (P >.50) among African-American women compared with white women (see
Table 2).
Supportive care and follow-up

(3.6%) were diagnosed with stage IV disease (P < .05).

white women (3.6%) were diagnosed with stage IV disease
(P < 0.05) (Fig. 1).
Positive estrogen receptor/progesterone
receptor status

Positive ER/PR status was documented in >70% of
white women and African-American women. Fewer
African-American women had positive ER/PR status than
white women (56% vs 75%; P ¼ .001). Among women
who had positive ER/PR status, African-American women
were less likely to receive aromatase inhibitors (P < .001)
or tamoxifen (P<.001) (Table 2).
Adjusted Analyses
Stage at diagnosis

In adjusted analyses, the odds that African-American
women would be diagnosed with a later stage of cancer
were nearly twice those of white women (odds ratio [OR],
1.71; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.09-2.67; P ¼ .02)
after adjusting for age, geography according to RUCA
code, and SES (Table 3).
Treatment Patterns: Unadjusted Analyses

With the exception of erythrocyte growth factor,
white women were more likely to receive supportive
care or to have adverse events from illness or therapy.
Although depression or antidepressant treatment (17.4%)
and anxiety or anxiolytic therapy (17%) were prevalent
in the total cohort, only 1 woman was referred to a
mental health professional. Slightly less than 50% of all
women of both races had notation and documentation
of follow-up with their PCP in their medical chart (see
Table 2).
Chemotherapy dose modification

Of the 458 patients who received chemotherapy (294
white women, 75 African-American women, 89 women of
other/undocumented race), 19% had a medical chart notation of dose interruption or reduction, ie, modification. An
analysis of only African-American women or white women
indicated that older women (P ¼ .03) and white women (P
¼ .07) had a higher percentage of chemotherapy dose delay
or dose reduction compared with younger or African-American women, respectively (see Table 4).
Mortality

The mortality rate from any cause was higher in
African-American women (8%) compared with white
women (4%; P ¼ .06). Breast cancer progression was the
cause of 56% of all documented deaths and caused a
higher percentage of deaths in white women (59%) than
in African-American women (50%). There was no correlation between survival status and SES (Table 5).
Multivariate Adjusted Analyses
Antiestrogen therapy

White women were twice as likely to receive antiestrogen therapy compared with African-American women
(OR, 2.09; 95% CI, 1.07-4.06; P ¼ .03) after adjusting
for age, stage, SES, and positive ER/PR status (Table 3).

Overall treatment

A higher percentage of African-American women
received chemotherapy compared with white women
(P ¼ .002). The use of antiestrogen therapy was more frequent in white women than in African-American women

DISCUSSION
In the current analyses, we hypothesized that race was
associated with differences in stage of cancer at diagnosis,
use of antiestrogen therapy, use of breast-conserving surgery, chemotherapy dose interruption or reduction, and
rates of mortality before and after adjusting for age, SES,
BMI, geography, and other relevant diagnostic and treatment factors. In adjusted analyses, we observed that race

198

was a factor in stage of cancer at diagnosis, antiestrogen
therapy, chemotherapy dose modification, and rates of
mortality. After adjusting for covariates, stage at diagnosis
and antiestrogen therapy still were associated significantly
with race. Our findings are distinguishable from previous
studies in this area, because we compared AfricanAmerican women and white women who had similar
commercial health insurance. We noted that AfricanAmerican women were diagnosed at younger ages and
with later stage disease than white women. Although
African-American women were younger, their all-cause
mortality was double that of white women. In this study,
we also uncovered several apparent gaps in

Comorbid medical conditions have been identified
previously as a risk factor for increased complications in
African-American women in a cohort with 47% commercial health insurance, 28% Medicare coverage only, and
18% Medicaid insurance.13 In our sample, African-American women had higher rates of hypertension and renal
disease compared with white women. We also observed
that more white women had positive ER/PR status in our

sample compared with African-American women, a finding that supports the current literature.7,10,11 In addition,
white women were more likely to receive antiestrogen
therapy after adjusting for age, SES, and geography.
We observed that African-American women were
younger and were diagnosed with a later disease stage than
white women, findings that also are supported by previous
studies.8,9 Moorman et al8 suggested that obesity and SES
may contribute to differences in disease stage at diagnosis.
BMI was higher in African-American women versus white
women in our study. We observed no differences in disease stage at diagnosis, treatment, or mortality based on

Our findings suggest that the identification of
racially based disparities in medical care among
patients who have newly diagnosed breast cancer can
catalyze and refine the development of culturally sensitive interventions that could improve outcomes in African-American women. Health plan reminders, call
centers, and community outreach programs are potential avenues for patient education. In addition, health
plans are well positioned to proactively collaborate
with oncologists to improve communication regarding
early notification of diagnoses and support for patients
in initial treatment.
Documentation gaps in the medical charts that we
reviewed represented opportunities to improve quality
of care, potentially through the use of health plan-provided flow sheets. These tools could improve documentation of race, which is an important factor in these
analyses and was missing in >20% of all charts that we
reviewed. Diagnostic testing rates and medical chart
documentation of test results must improve for healthcare to improve, particularly for African-American
women. We demonstrated that <50% of the charts in
this study had any documentation of communication
between oncologists and PCPs, which could be
improved with secure electronic communication systems
or integrated electronic health records. Future analyses
in other health plans should include more focus on
chemotherapy dose intensity, especially in relation to
other patient factors, such as the use of supportive therapy. This will require adequate documentation of dosing and intent of treatment (curative vs palliative). Such
analyses could investigate the potentially greater opportunity for white women to have a curative goal because

SES. Our mortality data are supported by previous findings,4-7 but the small sample size precluded investigation
of the impact covariates may have had on the association
between mortality and race.

of a lower disease stage at diagnosis and to evaluate any
impact on the use of supportive care.
Our data indicate that most patients who were
depressed or anxious did not receive mental health support. The development of screening programs to identify and refer breast cancer patients to mental health
providers is underused and necessary. The health plan
that was involved in this study developed a resource list
to address mental health and support groups for
patients that was well received by both patients and providers.18 Family involvement is another avenue by
which health plans may help to optimize care and promote compliance.
Our analyses had a few limitations. Claims data
generally do not have complete capture because of coordination of benefits, do not contain services received
through the public health system, and may contain coding inaccuracies and errors. These limitations are inherent in the use of retrospective claims data, and our
stringent definition of ‘‘newly diagnosed’’ precluded any
active cancer diagnosis or treatment ongoing on or
around the time frame of interest, which strengthened
our analyses. Our chart selection methodology focused
on high-volume oncology offices, because chart abstraction studies are limited by budget and time factors. We
collected data from large practices for efficiency and to
facilitate the analysis of chemotherapy dose modifications. However, we could not determine whether the
initial dose was the protocol-specified dose and may
have missed dose reductions that were included in the
‘‘intended’’ dose. We did not obtain greater than 8% of
charts from any single practice so that the data would
not be skewed by a particular provider’s group practice
patterns. In addition, the acquisition of mortality data
relied on chart notation and was limited by physician’s
continued follow-up of patients. There also were
strengths in our analyses. We concurrently measured
risk factors for breast cancer, diagnostic patterns, treatment patterns, adverse events, and supportive care
received. We also measured patient outcomes and the
development of adverse events, which we compared
across racial differences. The most notable and compelling strength of these data were that all women had
equivalent health plan coverage and access to care.
Among commercially insured patients who were
newly diagnosed with breast cancer, we observed that
disparities in care existed between African-American
women and white women. We determined that opportunities to address these disparities include facilitating

diagnosis at earlier stages, improving ER/PR testing
rates and documentation of testing/results, increasing
the percentage of ER/PR-positive patients who receive
antiestrogen therapy, and aggressively managing comorbidities. Health plan-initiated interventions are needed
for patient education, support of adequate care, and
continued communication regarding breast cancer diagnosis and treatment.18 Currently, we are evaluating
such efforts in the health plan that was used for this
study. We encourage health plans and healthcare providers to offer culturally sensitive support and education
to women who are diagnosed with breast cancer and to
encourage active participation in their treatment
decisions.
