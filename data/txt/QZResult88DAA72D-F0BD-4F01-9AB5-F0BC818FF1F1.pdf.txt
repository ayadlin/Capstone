ABSTRACT
Glucose fermentation through glycolysis even in the presence of oxygen
(Warburg effect) is a common feature of cancer cells increasingly considered as
an enticing target in clinical development. This study aimed to analyze the link
between metabolism, energy stores and proliferation rates in cancer cells. We found
that cell proliferation, evaluated by DNA synthesis quantification, is correlated to
glycolytic efficiency in six cancer cell lines as well as in isogenic cancer cell lines. To
further investigate the link between glycolysis and proliferation, a pharmacological
inhibitior of the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) was used. We demonstrated
that reduction of PPP activity decreases cancer cells proliferation, with a profound
effect in Warburg-phenotype cancer cells. The crucial role of the PPP in sustaining
cancer cells proliferation was confirmed using siRNAs against glucose-6-phosphate
dehydrogenase, the first and rate-limiting enzyme of the PPP. In addition, we found
that dichloroacetate (DCA), a new clinically tested compound, induced a switch of
glycolytic cancer cells to a more oxidative phenotype and decreased proliferation.
By demonstrating that DCA decreased the activity of the PPP, we provide a new
mechanism by which DCA controls cancer cells proliferation.

INTRODUCTION

primarily occurs under hypoxia as a rescue mechanism for
energy production. However, some cancer cells further
adopt a particular glycolytic phenotype, first described
by Warburg [8] and coined ‘aerobic glycolysis’ [9].
The biological rationale behind the Warburg phenotype
remains controversial, but it has been recently proposed
that proliferating cancer cells enhance glycolysis because
it benefits both bioenergetics and biosynthesis [4, 10].
Indeed, a glycolytic metabolism potentially allows fast
ATP production and provides carbon intermediates that can
be directed to branched biosynthetic pathways, enabling
a faster expansion of the cellular biomass. Convincingly,
mutations occurring in signaling pathways regulating
both cellular biosynthesis and aerobic glycolysis, such
as the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway, are the most prevalent

These last few years, metabolism has generated
tremendous interest in the field of cancer research.
Many studies focused on the various metabolic profiles
of different tumors [1-3] because metabolic plasticity
is involved in cancer progression, drug resistance and
metastasis [4-6]. In normal cells, glycolysis is coupled
to oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) to optimally
synthesize intracellular ATP from glucose [7]. However,
many cancer cells undergo a fundamental metabolic
transformation, the “glycolytic switch”, by which
glycolysis is uncoupled from respiration and rewired to
lactic fermentation, thus becoming the primary source of
cell ATP production. Switching to a glycolytic metabolism

class of mutations in human tumors [11]. However,
experimental evidence linking aerobic glycolysis to cancer
cell proliferation is lacking, and the selective advantage
provided by this phenotype is not entirely clear. The aim
of the present study was to elucidate the coupling between
metabolism, energy supply and cell proliferation in various
human and murine cancer cells. Metabolic switches were
induced to provide evidence that bioenergetics, and
more particularly glycolysis, directly drives cancer cell
proliferation. In this line, we found a new therapeutic
mechanism of dichloroacetate (DCA), an activator of the
mitochondrial oxidation of glucose currently investigated
in clinical studies [12]. DCA inhibited the pentose
phosphate pathway (PPP), a pivotal biosynthetic pathway
branched to glycolysis. We report that the PPP bridges
the gap between a glycolytic metabolism and cancer cell
proliferation.

Glycolytic efficiency is positively linked to
proliferation but not to ATP levels in cancer cells
A screening of the metabolic activities of six
cancer cell lines was first performed in order to
investigate the link between glucose metabolism, ATP
stores and proliferation capacity. OXPHOS, evaluated
by the oligomycine-sensitive oxygen consumption rate
(mitoOCR), and glycolytic efficiency, measured by the
lactate produced to glucose consumed (mol/mol) ratio
[13], were assessed separately on cells incubated 24 hours
in a culture medium containing only glucose as energetic
fuel. To investigate the influence of the metabolic status on

plots between metabolic parameters (glycolytic efficiency and mitochondrial oxygen consumption rate [mitoOCR]), intracellular ATP
content and proliferation of six human and murine cancer cell lines. Measurements were performed after 24 h incubation in the presence
of a culture medium containing only glucose as energetic fuel. The mitoOCR was determined by the oligomycin-sensitive OCR of viable
whole cells and the glycolytic efficiency (glucose consumption/lactate production ratio) was measured from cells supernatant. Total ATP
was quantified from lysed cells and normalized to protein content. Proliferation rates were analyzed by the incorporation of a nucleotid
analog (5-bromo-2’-deoxyuridine [BrdU]). A significant correlation was found between glycolytic efficiency and proliferation (p-value =
0.04, Pearson r = 0.82). Non-significant correlations were found between mitoOCR and ATP content (p-value = 0.06, Pearson r = 0.78),
mitoOCR and proliferation (p-value = 0.053, Pearson r = -0.80) and between glycolytic efficiency and ATP content (p-value = 0.11, Pearson

cellular energy stores, total intracellular ATP pool was also
measured. No significant correlation was found between
intracellular ATP content and the metabolic parameters.
However, we found that cell proliferation evaluated by
DNA synthesis was significantly correlated to glycolytic
efficiency (Figure 1A), where increased glycolysis was
associated with an increased proliferation capacity, and
inversely. No significant correlation was observed between
proliferation capacity and mitochondrial respiration.
These data suggest that glycolysis is potentially the key
energetic pathway supporting cancer cell proliferation. It
is currently hypothesized that this pathway supports cell
proliferation predominantly by supplying precursors for
biosynthetic pathways, rather than by ATP production
[10, 11]. Supporting that ATP supply is not the main
limiting factor for cell proliferation, no correlation
between ATP content and DNA synthesis was found in
the cell lines (Supplemental Figure S1). To confirm that
glycolysis promotes cancer cell proliferation and exclude
metabolism-independent influences inherent to different

genotypes, the proliferation capacity of human wild-type
(WT) oxidative SiHa cervical cancer cells was compared
to that of SiHa with partial mitochondrial depletion (SiHa
ρ0) [14, 15]. SiHa ρ0 cancer cells exhibited a glycolytic
phenotype with a ~40% decrease in mitoOCR (Figure 1B),
a ~2.5 fold increase in glycolytic efficiency (Figure 1C)
and a ~50% increase in glucose consumption (Figure 1D).
The net ~20% decrease in total ATP pool in SiHa ρ0 cells
confirmed that enhanced glycolysis was not sufficient to
maintain ATP stores (Figure 1E). By performing DNA
synthesis quantification, we found that enhanced aerobic
glycolysis promotes cell proliferation, as the glycolytic
switch in SiHa ρ0 cells was associated with a ~45%
increase in cell proliferation (Figure 1F). Viability assays
revealed no difference in viable cell number 24 h after
cells were incubated in the experimental culture medium
(Supplemental Figure S2), likely because DNA synthesis
quantification detects early changes in the proliferation
rate of the cells.

Glycolysis inhibition by DCA impairs cancer cell
proliferation

To test this hypothesis, glycolytic MDA-MB-231 and
oxidative SiHa cancer cells were treated with 5 mM DCA
for 48 h, and the effects of the treatment on metabolism
and proliferation were assessed. Compared to vehicletreated cells, DCA induced a switch of glycolytic MDAMB-231 cancer cells to a more oxidative phenotype as
evidenced by an increase in mitoOCR (Figure 2A) and
a decrease in glucose consumption (Figure 2B). The
decrease in glycolytic activity observed in this experiment
is consistent with another recent study [18] and is likely
induced by the Pasteur Effect [4, 19] to maintain ATP
homeostasis in the cells (Figure 2C). We also observed
that glycolysis inhibition by DCA was associated with a
decreased proliferation rate of MDA-MB-231 cancer cells
(Figure 2D). Supporting that glycolysis inhibition impairs
proliferation in this cell line, 2-Deoxy-D-glucose-treated
MDA-MB-231 cancer cells also exhibited a decreased
proliferation rate (Supplemental Figure S3).
On the other hand, DCA did not significantly alter

Based on our observations, we further investigated
whether glycolysis inhibition could directly impair cancer
cell proliferation. For the purpose, MDA-MB-231 human
breast cancer cells (Warburg phenotype, Figure 1A) and
SiHa human cervical cancer cells (oxidative phenotype,
Figure 1A) were treated with dichloroacetate (DCA),
a pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) inhibitor that
enhances the oxidative activity of cells by activating
pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), the gate-keeping
enzyme of glucose oxidation in mitochondria [16].
To date, the promising therapeutic effect of DCA on
cancer cells is globally attributed to a normalization of
the hyperpolarized mitochondrial membrane potential
characterizing cancer cells and to re-sensitization to
apoptosis [17]. Here, we postulated that DCA also
controls tumor proliferation by inhibiting glycolysis.

Glycolysis controls cancer cell proliferation
through the pentose phosphate pathway

the metabolic activities of oxidative SiHa cancer cells
(Figure 2A-2C) and had no significant effects on SiHa
proliferation (Figure 2D). Short-term (1 hour) lactate
production measurements showed that DCA was indeed
more effective in the glycolytic cancer cell line than in
the oxidative one (Supplemental Figure S4). To investigate
whether the metabolic profile determine the response to
DCA, the proliferation capacity of glycolytic SiHa ρ0
cancer cells was also analyzed after DCA treatment. We
found a significant decrease in DNA synthesis in this
cell line (Figure 2E), an effect that was not observed in
SiHa WT. Furthermore, the same number of viable MDAMB-231 and SiHa ρ0 cancer cells were measured 48 h
after treatment with vehicle or DCA (Supplemental Figure
S5 A-B), showing that the effects of DCA on metabolic
functions and proliferation rates are not due to cell
mortality.

Taken together, our data provided compiling
experimental evidence that glycolysis per se is involved
in the control of cell proliferation. The mechanism
linking glycolysis and proliferation still remained to be
established. We postulated that the pentose phosphate
pathway (PPP) could link glycolysis to proliferation, as
the PPP uses glycolytic intermediates to supply cells with
nucleotides and NADPH, a crucial reductant in anabolic
processes [20]. To specifically determine NADPH
produced from the PPP (NADPHppp), cells were treated
with 6-aminonicotinamide (6-AN), a specific inhibitor
of the PPP [21, 22]. We found that the contribution
of NADPHppp to the total NADPH pool (NADPHtot)
was more predominant in MDA-MB-231 cancer cells
than in SiHa cancer cells, as evidenced by a major
decrease in NADPHtot level following 6-AN treatment
in glycolytic MDA-MB-231 cells (Figure 3A). More
limited effects were seen in SiHa oxidative cells (Figure
3B). Measurements also revealed higher NADPHppp/

NADP+ ratio in MDA-MB-231 cancer cells, highlighting
a higher PPP flux in this glycolytic cell line compared to
SiHa (Figure 3C). To verify that the PPP is involved in
the control of cancer cells proliferation, DNA synthesis
in 6-AN-treated and non-treated cells was evaluated. We
observed that the proliferation capacity of cancer cells
was impaired when the PPP was inhibited (Figure 3D).
Interestingly, a stronger effect was evidenced in glycolytic
MDA-MB-231 (~70 % decrease in DNA synthesis rate)
compared to oxidative SiHa (~25 % decrease in DNA
synthesis rate) cancer cells (Figure 3D). Importantly, SiHa
ρ0 were more sensitive than SiHa WT to 6-AN as a ~40
% decrease in DNA synthesis was found (Supplemental
Figure S6). Owing to the potential off-target effects of
pharmacological inhibitors, we complemented our 6-AN
studies using small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) targeting
glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), the first and
rate-limiting enzyme of the PPP [23]. In MDA-MB-231
transfected cells, we confirmed silencing of G6PD by
immunoblotting (Figure 4A) and demonstrated that, like
6-AN, inhibition of G6PD decreased PPP activity (Figure

4B) and DNA synthesis (Figure 4C). These results point
out the predominant contribution of the PPP in sustaining
the proliferation of Warburg-phenotype cancer cells.

DCA inhibits the pentose phosphate pathway
Finally, we investigated whether DCA could inhibit
the PPP, which would explain the link between glycolysis
inhibition and the decreased proliferation rate of DCAtreated cancer cells. As shown in Figure 5, we observed
that DCA (5 mM, 48 h) significantly decreased NADPHtot
level in MDA-MB-231 cancer cells (Figure 5A).
Furthermore, while no additional decrease in NADPHtot
was obtained when cells were exposed to DCA and 6-AN
together (Figure 5A), we showed that DCA specifically
decreased NADPHPPP. Similar results were found using
molecular inhibition of G6PD (Figure 5B). These findings
demonstrate the implication of the PPP in the effects of
DCA on glycolytic cancer cells.

DISCUSSION

low intracellular ATP level was associated with increased
glycolysis. Moreover, the glycolytic switch induced in
mitochondria-deficient cancer cells was not able to provide
adequate ATP supply as compared to wild-type cells. It
is actually suggested that, bioenergetically speaking, a
glycolytic metabolism is less efficient than an oxidative
one, but that glycolysis may be advantageous to rapidly
produce ATP to meet short-timescale energy demands
[24]. Our findings also corroborates that Warburgphenotype cancer cells develop several adaptations to

This study emphasizes the predominant role of
the pentose phosphate pathway in cancer biology. The
Warburg effect (the fermentation of glucose to lactate in
the presence of a physiological O2 concentration) observed
in numerous cancer cells has been proposed to meet both
energetic (ATP) and biosynthetic demands [4, 10]. In this
study, we showed that enhanced aerobic glycolysis was not
sufficient to maintain ATP levels in cancer cells. Hence,

Figure 6: Mechanism by which DCA controls proliferation of glycolytic cancer cells. Highly glycolytic cancer cells exhibiting

a Warburg phenotype ferment large amounts of glucose into lactate even in the presence of oxygen. This phenomenon allows rapid ATP
production and provides precursors for biosynthetic processes promoting cell proliferation. By alleviating PDH inhibition by PDK, DCA
fosters the conversion of pyruvate into acetyl-CoA and activates mitochondrial respiration. The consequent allosteric inhibition of glycolysis
by ATP reduces glucose consumption and glycolytic intermediates levels, thereby decreasing the flux of the pentose phosphate pathway

maintain low ATP levels in order to avoid the allosteric
inhibition of rate-limiting glycolytic enzymes (the Pasteur
Effect) and to keep elevated glycolytic flux rates [10].
On the other hand, we showed that glycolysis promotes
cancer cell proliferation, supporting the clinically tested
strategies that inhibit the Warburg Effect [12, 25]. The
positive relationship between glycolytic efficiency (moles
of lactate produced per mole of glucose consumed) and the
proliferation rate of cancer cells highlighted that rapidly
dividing cells ferment large amounts of glucose in lactate.
Recent studies have proposed that lactate production
allows cancer cells to efficiently regenerate NAD+ by
the enzyme lactate dehydrogenase [26]. By maintaining
NAD+/NADH redox balance, cancer cells allow faster
glucose flux through glycolysis, along with faster
incorporation of glucose metabolites into biosynthetic
pathways, thereby conferring advantages for proliferation
[10].
To test whether enhanced aerobic glycolysis
promotes cancer cells proliferation by fuelling anabolic
processes, involvement of the pentose phosphate pathway
(PPP) was evaluated. Indeed, it is known that the PPP uses
glucose-6-phophate (the product of the glycolytic enzyme
hexokinase) to supply cells with nucleotides and NADPH,
a crucial reductant in anabolic reactions [20]. In our study,
we showed that PPP flux, evaluated by the NADPHppp/
NADP+ ratio, was enhanced in Warburg-phenotype as
compared to oxidative cancer cells. Comparison of the
activity of PPP enzymes could also have been assayed
to confirm this difference in PPP flux. Nevertheless, our
results support that activation of glycolysis is accompanied
by an increase in PPP activity for biosynthesis in rapidly
dividing cells [20]. Convincingly, we observed that
inhibition of the PPP decreased cancer cell proliferation,
with a major effect in Warburg-phenotype cancer cells.
The different sensitivity of glycolytic and oxidative
cancer cells to PPP inhibition is likely due to the variable
reliance on this pathway for macromolecules synthesis;
such as lipids and nucleotides. In addition, cancer cells
with elevated mitochondrial activity may compensate
NADPH levels by using TCA cycle-associated enzymes
(malic enzymes and isocitrate dehydrogenases) to
replenish the NADPH pool [20]. Taken together, these
results demonstrate that cancer cells, especially aggressive
Warburg-phenotype cancer cells, rely on the pentose
phosphate pathway for optimal proliferation.
To evaluate the therapeutic relevance of these
findings, the effects of DCA were investigated. DCA has
already shown interesting anticancer properties in vitro and
in vivo [17], and is currently tested in Phase I-II clinical
trials [12]. To date, DCA owes its therapeutic properties
to the re-sensitization of cancer cells to apoptosis [17].
However, as recently pointed out by Stockwin et al. [27],
DCA is relatively inactive on cell viability and induces
apoptosis only at high concentrations. Stockwin et al.
further reported that DCA was preferentially active in
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

cells with mitochondrial defect. Therefore, we postulated
that, at lower dose, DCA also decreases cancer cells
proliferation by reducing glycolysis. We found that 5 mM
DCA was more effective in Warburg-phenotype cancer
cells, reducing cell proliferation by decreasing glycolysis.
The different sensitivities among cell lines with different
metabolic phenotype may result from the capacity of
DCA to reach PDK in the matrix of mitochondria. Indeed,
like pyruvate, DCA is ionized and cannot pass through
membranes. Curiously, there have been only few reports
on the transport of DCA in the cytosol of mammalian
cells [28, 29]. Although not yet investigated, the level of
expression of mitochondrial pyruvate transporters (MPCs)
may also define DCA efficacy. Furthermore, as DCA has
a different Ki for each of the four PDK isoenzymes [30],
the variable sensitivity of cancer cells may result from de
differential expression of PDKs.
Although some reports showed that DCA in
comparable concentrations promotes cytotoxicity in other
cell lines [31, 32], we showed that DCA had no incidence
on MDA-MB-231 and SiHa cancer cells viability. Based
on our data, we propose that the reactivation of ATP
production in mitochondria induced by DCA lowers
the glycolytic flux of cancer cells, thereby reducing the
incorporation of glucose. Consequently, the decrease
in the synthesis of glycolytic intermediates reduces
the activity of biosynthetic pathways such as the PPP,
compromising the proliferation of Warburg-phenotype
cancer cells (Figure 6). Nevertheless, it is conceivable that
other mechanisms may participate to the anti-proliferative
effects of DCA, as other studies have shown cell cycle
arrest at comparable DCA concentrations [33, 34].
Overall, our study showed that the PPP bridges
glycolysis and proliferation in aggressive cancer cells, and
pleads for considering cancer metabolism for the choice
of adequate therapeutic anticancer strategies. In particular,
joining the conclusions of others [27], we suggest that
clinical development of DCA may benefit from selecting
patients with highly glycolytic tumors.

siRNA transfection

Total intracellular ATP was measured by the
ATP Determination Kit (Invitrogen) according to
manufacturer’s protocol. Cells were washed twice
with PBS and lysed in the buffer recommended by
the manufacturer (10 mM Tris, 1 mM EDTA, 100 mM
NaCl, 0.01% Triton X-100). Cell lysates were added to
a reaction mixture containing luciferase and luciferine
for bioluminescence measurements using a plate reader
(SpectraMax M2e, Molecular Devices). A standard curve
was generated with known ATP concentrations in the same
conditions. A fraction of the cell lysates was systematically
used for protein quantification (Pierce BCA Protein assay,
Thermo Scientific) to normalize ATP level to the protein
content.

Glucose consumption and lactate production
Glucose consumption and lactate production
were measured from supernatants of the cultured
cells. Metabolite concentrations were quantified on
deproteinized samples using specific enzymatic assays
on a CMA600 analyzer (CMA Microdialysis AB, Solna,
Sweden). Glucose consumption and lactate production
were normalized to protein content using the Pierce BCA
Protein assay (Thermo Scientific). To efficiently detect
differences in metabolite concentrations between SiHa
WT and SiHa ρ0 supernatants, a low glucose (1 g/L)
medium was used.

Intracellular ATP quantification

ON-TARGETplus SMARTpool siRNA against
human G6PD and ON-TARGETplus Non-targeting siRNA
were from Dharmacon. Final siRNA concentration was
25 nM. All siRNA were transfected using RNAi/MAX
according to manufacturer’s instructions (Invitrogen).

Western blotting
Whole cell lysates were collected and subjected
to immunoblot analysis as previously described [40].
Primary antibodies were human monoclonals against
G6PD or Hsp90 (Sigma).

Proliferation

Mitochondrial oxygen consumption

Cell proliferation was assayed with a 5-bromo-2’deoxyuridine (BrdU)-ELISA based kit (Roche) following
provider’s instructions. Sub-confluent cells were incubated
in the presence of BrdU (a nucleotide analog) during 4
hours. When proliferation of SiHa WT and SiHa ρ0 were
compared, cells were incubated during 6 hours in the
presence of BrdU. The amount of BrdU incorporated in
the cells was assessed by colorimetric measurements using
a plate reader (SpectraMax M2e, Molecular Devices),
which allowed the quantitation of DNA synthesis in
replicating cells.

The oxygen consumption rate (OCR) of intact
whole cells was measured using a Bruker EMX EPR
spectrometer operating at 9.5 GHz as previously described
[41]. Adherent cells were harvested in fresh experimental
medium (107 cells/ml). 100 µl of the cell suspension were
mixed with 100 µl of 20% dextran to avoid agglomeration
and cells were sealed in a glass capillary tube in the
presence of 0.2 mM of a nitroxide probe acting as an
oxygen sensor (15N 4-oxo-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidined16-15N-1-oxyl, CDN isotopes, Pointe-Claire, Quebec,
Canada). Cells were maintained at 37°C during the
acquisition of the spectra. EPR linewidth was measured
every minute and reported on a calibration curve to obtain
the oxygen concentration. OCR was determined by the
absolute value of the slope of the decrease in oxygen
concentration in the closed capillary tube over time [42].
