BACKGROUND. The purpose of the current study was to evaluate the activity and
toxicity of dexamethasone, high-dose cytarabine, and carboplatin (DAC) combination therapy in children with newly diagnosed large-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and to estimate the event-free and overall survival rates achieved
when DAC is incorporated into a conventional regimen.

METHODS. From 1991 to 1997, 20 boys and 5 girls aged 4.2 to 17.7 years who had
stage III (according to the St. Jude staging system ) (n 5 21) or stage IV (n 5 4)
large-cell NHL were treated in this study. DAC therapy was administered at the
beginning of the induction phase in 2 sequential cycles and incorporated
throughout a continuation phase (modified from the ACOPþ regimen, which features doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisone) with doxoru-

*The study was a randomized trial in which no significant difference with regard to EFS was found between the COMP and D-COMP regimens.28

treatments for Burkitt lymphomas are intensive, cyclophosphamide-based (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone [CHOP])regimens
given over a relatively short period (4-8 months),3-13
whereas those for lymphoblastic disease are often
derived from regimens used to treat high-risk acute
lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) that feature intensive
chemotherapy given over a prolonged period (18-30
months).14-20 Determining the optimal therapy for
large-cell NHL has proved problematic, partly
because of the biologic heterogeneity of these tumors
and because of the wide spectrum of treatment strategies reported.14,21-33 For example, in Europe treatment has been based on immunophenotype,
whereas in the U.S. patients have historically been
treated according to histologic findings and disease
stage, regardless of immunophenotype.10,12,33,34 The
histology-directed treatment approach has resulted
in a 50% to 70% long-term event-free survival rate
for
children
with
advanced-stage
large-cell
NHL14,19,21,28-32 (Table 1). The histology-based treatment approaches rely heavily on anthracyclines and
alkylating agents and are frequently CHOP-based
regimens; however, some regimens include other
agents such as methotrexate, mercaptopurine, bleomycin, and cytarabine.
We and others have demonstrated that the combination of dexamethasone, high-dose cytarabine,
and cisplatin (DHAP) is active against recurrent
large-cell NHL.32 In an effort to improve treatment
outcome while reducing the total anthracycline and
cyclophosphamide exposure, we incorporated a
modified DHAP regimen into the treatment for

patients with newly diagnosed large-cell NHL; we
used carboplatin instead of cisplatin to minimize
ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity. The combination of
dexamethasone, cytarabine, and carboplatin (DAC)
was administered at the beginning of the induction
phase as 2 sequential courses and incorporated
throughout a continuation phase modified from the
ACOPþ regimen, which features doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisone.30 Herein
we report the activity of the initial courses of DAC
given during induction, as well as the treatment efficacy and toxicity of the entire treatment program.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Twenty-five children (20 boys and 5 girls ages 4.217.7 years) with advanced-stage large-cell NHL, as
defined by the NCI Working Formulation,1 were evaluated and treated at our institution between 1991
and 1997. More recently, classification according to
the WHO system was performed in cases for which
there was available tissue.2 Staging workup included
computed tomography (CT) imaging of the neck,
chest, abdomen, and pelvis; nuclear imaging (eg, gallium scan, bone scan); bilateral posterior iliac crest
bone marrow aspiration and biopsy examination and
lumbar puncture for examination of cerebrospinal
fluid. Upon completion of this workup, lymphomas
were staged according to the St. Jude system as described
by Murphy.35 The treatment protocol was approved by
our Institutional Review Board and informed consent
permission for treatment was obtained for all research
participants or their legal guardians.

these have been footnoted as such in Table 3. Overall
survival time was measured from the date of diagnosis to the date of death or date of last contact. Eventfree survival was measured from the date of diagnosis to the date of induction failure, recurrence, death,

event-free survival were estimated with Kaplan-Meier

assessed renal function by measuring serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen concentration and by
estimating the GFR from Tc99 clearance measurements. Echocardiography and electrocardiography
were performed before each cycle of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and dexamethasone
(CHOD) to evaluate anthracycline-induced cardiac
toxicity. Audiograms were performed before each
dose of carboplatin to evaluate ototoxicity. After the
completion of therapy, we performed a physical examination, blood chemistry analyses, complete blood
counts, and diagnostic imaging studies (as outlined
above for initial staging) to evaluate remission status
and treatment-related toxicity. These evaluations
were made monthly for the first 6 months, every 2
months for the next 6 months, every 3 months in the
second year after therapy, and annually thereafter.

grams were obtained annually to screen for chemotherapy-related organ dysfunction.

RESULTS
Twenty-one patients had stage III disease and 4 had
stage IV disease. The clinical features, including sites
of disease at the time of diagnosis, are summarized
in Table 3.
Twenty-two of the 25 patients (88%; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 68%-97%) achieved a CR (n
5 13) or PR (n 5 9) to the initial 2 sequential courses
of DAC. With additional therapy (the CHOD regimen), some of the patients who had achieved a PR
to DAC had CRs, resulting in a CR rate of 72% and a
PR rate of 12%. The 5-year event-free survival rate
(SE) was 64%  9% (median follow-up, 9.1 years)
(Fig. 1). With retrieval therapy, including autologous
hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (6 patients),
a 5-year overall survival rate of 80%  8% was
achieved (Fig. 1). With respect to immunophenotype
(Table 3), the 5-year event-free survival (SE) and
overall survival rates for those with B-cell immunophenotype (diffuse large B-cell lymphoma [DLBCL],
mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma [MLBCL], and Blarge cell, not otherwise specified [LC-B NOS]) were
63% þ 16% and 88% þ 11%, respectively, and for
those with a non-B-cell immunophenotype (anaplastic large-cell lymphoma [ALCL] and T-large cell,
not otherwise specified [LC-T, NOS]), these rates
were 57% þ 13% and 71% þ 12%, respectively.
Grade 4 hematologic toxicity was observed in
73% of patients. Overall, episodes of fever with neutropenia occurred after 1 of every 3 blocks of DAC

administered. There were 4 episodes of grade 3
mucositis and grade 3 transaminase elevation and 1
episode of grade 3 hyperbilirubinemia; none of these
episodes followed treatment with DAC. There was no
evidence of substantial renal toxicity as shown by
stable serum creatinine concentration and Tc99
clearance rates. No patients had a significant
decrease in the shortening fraction on the echocardiogram. Six patients had loss of high-frequency
hearing, with decreased acuity above 2000 hertz (Hz)
(n 5 2), 6000 Hz (n 5 2), or 8000 Hz (n 5 2). None
of these patients required hearing amplification.

DISCUSSION
Improving the treatment outcome for children with
large-cell NHL while reducing morbidity and the risk
of late adverse effects remains a challenge. Various
approaches to address this problem have been investigated. For example, the former Pediatric Oncology
Group piloted a regimen that incorporates intermediate-dose methotrexate and cytarabine into the APO
regimen, which features doxorubicin, vincristine, and
prednisone.39 The addition of intermediate-dose
methotrexate and cytarabine, however, failed to significantly improve outcome.39 High-dose methotrexate and agents such as ifosfamide have been
featured in successful European trials performed by
the German (BFM) and French (SFOP) cooperative
groups.40-45 In an attempt to find new, active drug
combinations that have fewer acute and late adverse
effects, we piloted the current study, in which DAC
was given during both induction and continuation
therapy. The CHOP component of the ACOPþ regimen

DAC+ for Advanced Large-cell Lymphoma/Sandlund et al

is widely accepted as being active against large-cell
lymphoma in adults, but to our knowledge reports of
the activity of low-dose methotrexate, mercaptopurine,
and L-asparaginase against large-cell NHL are lacking.
Nonetheless, because these drugs were components of
the successful ACOPþ regimen, we maintained their
use in this regimen.
In the current study the DAC combination was
very active, as shown by the 88% CR or PR rate after
2 cycles of treatment. However, after completion of
the entire treatment regimen (induction, consolidation, and continuation), the 5-year event-free survival
rate was 64%  9%, which is similar to those
obtained with more conventional histology-directed,
CHOP-based regimens (Table 1). Likewise, Fisher
et al46 made a similar observation that the incorporation of additional agents in the treatment of largecell NHL in adults did not improve long-term outcome over that obtained with CHOP treatment
alone.
Although the inclusion of DAC in the current
study did not appear to improve the event-free survival rate, it is important to note that with this regimen we achieved similar results to those obtained
previously, but with lower cumulative doses of
anthracycline and cyclophosphamide. Thus, DAC is a
potential option for patients in whom there is a clinical indication or desire to reduce either total anthracycline (compared with APO) or cyclophosphamide
(compared with ACOPþ) exposure. The most severe
acute toxicity associated with this DAC-based regimen was myelosuppression with associated febrile
neutropenia, which occurred after approximately
one-third of the DAC courses administered. For this
reason, granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor was
given after the first 2 courses of DAC, during induction. Rarely, grade 3 mucositis and grade 3 transaminase elevation occurred, but not after the DAC
cycles. Of note, the use of carboplatin did not produce significant renal toxicity, as determined by serum creatinine and Tc99 clearance studies. A few
patients developed mild ototoxicity, which resulted
primarily in hearing loss involving high-frequency
tones; such loss would not affect conversational
speech and hearing.
Sequelae of existing CHOP-based therapy that
are the most concerning include cardiac toxicity,47-56
infertility,57 and second malignancies. Cyclophosphamide and other alkylating agents result in a doserelated depletion of germinal cells that is generally
more severe in males than in females. Recovery of
spermatogenesis after cyclophosphamide-induced
azoospermia is dose-related. Sterility is likely at cumulative doses 7.5 g/m2, whereas fertility is usually

787

maintained at doses <4 g/m2.57 Our regimen prescribed a cumulative cyclophosphamide dose of 3.2
g/m2, which should permit the preservation of fertility in most patients. The Pediatric Oncology Group
published the results of a study comparing APO with
ACOPþ that indicated that cyclophosphamide could
be eliminated if the regimen maintained a relatively
anthracycline-rich backbone.31
The desire to avoid anthracycline-related cardiac
toxicity is an important factor influencing protocol
development in pediatric oncology patients. Whereas
cumulative doses of doxorubicin of 550 mg/m2 are
generally well tolerated in adults, cumulative doses
of doxorubicin of 45 mg/m2 to 300 mg/m2 may
cause abnormalities of ventricular after load and
contractility in children.48 Factors predictive of cardiac dysfunction include a high cumulative anthracycline dose and higher intensity of anthracycline
dosage, female sex, young age, use of mediastinal
irradiation, and a long time interval since the completion of therapy.47,49,50,53-56 All of the patients in
the current study had normal cardiac function
according to routine echocardiography and electrocardiography during and after completion of therapy.
Our regimen prescribed a total cumulative dose of
195 mg/m2 of doxorubicin, which we anticipate will
be associated with a low risk of late-onset cardiac
toxicity. However, continued monitoring of cardiac
function in these children is essential to evaluate
delayed effects that may emerge with time.
Other groups have examined the need for
anthracyclines as well as novel ways to preserve cardiac function when anthracyclines are used. The former Children’s Cancer Group’s randomized trial of
cyclophosphamide, vincristine, methotrexate, and
prednisone (COMP) versus D-COMP (daunorubicin
plus the COMP regimen)(Table 1) demonstrated that
the addition of doxorubicin did not improve outcome compared with that achieved with COMP
alone.28 Nevertheless, as suggested by the Pediatric
Oncology Group Study,31 anthracyclines remain an
important class of agents in large-cell NHL treatment. Although cardioprotectants, such as dexrazoxane, may reduce cardiotoxicity in patients who
receive a high cumulative dose of anthracyclines,
careful monitoring of such use is recommended
because of the potentially increased risk of therapyrelated myeloid neoplasms.58
Previous exposure to alkylating agents, anthracyclines, epipodophyllotoxins, and radiotherapy has
been associated with the development of second
malignancies. For patients treated with the DAC regimen, we anticipate a low risk of treatment-related
secondary carcinogenesis, because this regimen

788

CANCER

comprises relatively low cumulative doses of cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin, and does not incorporate any epipodophyllotoxins or involved-field
radiotherapy. Additional follow-up of this cohort is
required to establish this supposition.
Studies suggest that an immunophenotype-directed approach may be more effective in the management of large-cell NHL in children.10,12,41,42,59 In a
Pediatric Oncology Group study comparing the APO
and ACOPþ regimens, children with B-cell tumors
had a significantly better treatment outcome than
did those with a non-B-cell immunophenotype; however, the sample size in that study was relatively
small.59 The French cooperative group (SFOP)
reported an excellent result for the treatment of Bcell large-cell NHLs with their LMB89 regimen,
which they use for all B-cell NHL, including Burkitt
lymphoma.10,42 The German BFM cooperative group,
which also uses an immunophenotype-directed
approach, has reported excellent results for treatment of B-cell large-cell NHL.12,41 All 6 patients with
diffuse large B-cell lymphoma in the current study (2
with mediastinal large B-cell disease), were alive and
free of disease at the time of last follow-up (1 patient
is in second disease remission after salvage therapy).
In contrast, the 5-year event-free and overall survival
in the current study for those with a non-B-cell
immunophenotype was found to be 57% þ 13% and
71% þ 12%, respectively. Therefore, it appears that a
novel or more intensive regimen may be necessary
to treat the large-cell lymphomas of non-B-cell
immunophenotype.
In summary, the DAC combination is active in
previously untreated pediatric large cell lymphoma
and the entire DACþ regimen is effective and well
tolerated. Although DACþ did not produce a result
superior to other CHOP-based regimens, the low cumulative dosages of cyclophosphamide and anthracycline should be associated with the preservation of
fertility and a low rate of clinically significant cardiac
toxicity, therefore making DAC a consideration in
patients for whom these toxicities are of increased
concern. Many of the patients who experienced
treatment failure were successfully salvaged with autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation,
resulting in an excellent overall survival rate (80% 
8% at 5 years).
