Abstract
We previously showed that nicotine stimulates non–small cell
lung carcinoma (NSCLC) cell proliferation through nicotinic
acetylcholine receptor (nAChR)–mediated signals. Activation
of peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor B/D (PPARB/D)
has also been shown to induce NSCLC cell growth. Here, we
explore the potential link between nicotine and PPARB/D and
report that nicotine increases the expression of PPARB/D
protein; this effect was blocked by an A7 nAChR antagonist
(A-bungarotoxin), by A7 nAChR short interfering RNA, and by
inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K; wortmannin
and LY294002) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR;
rapamycin). In contrast, this effect was enhanced by
PUN282987, an A7 nAChR agonist. Silencing of PPARB/D
attenuated the stimulatory effect of nicotine on cell growth,
which was overcome by transfection of an exogenous PPARB/D
expression vector. Of note, nicotine induced complex formation between A7 nAChR and PPARB/D protein and increased
PPARB/D gene promoter activity through inhibition of AP-2A
as shown by reduced AP-2A binding using electrophoretic gel
mobility shift and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. In
addition, silencing of Sp1 attenuated the effect of nicotine on
PPARB/D. Collectively, our results show that nicotine increases
PPARB/D gene expression through A7 nAChR–mediated
activation of PI3K/mTOR signals that inhibit AP-2A protein
expression and DNA binding activity to the PPARB/D gene
promoter. Sp1 seems to modulate this process. This study
unveils a novel mechanism by which nicotine promotes
human lung carcinoma cell growth. [Cancer Res 2009;69(16):

Introduction
Lung carcinoma is one of the most common malignant tumors
in the world and is the leading cause of carcinoma death in the
United States (1, 2). Despite recent advances in understanding the
molecular biology of lung carcinoma and the introduction of
multiple new chemotherapeutic agents for its treatment, its dismal

5-year survival rate (<15%) has not changed substantially (3).
Tobacco use is one of the most important risk factors for the
development of lung carcinoma and is associated with at least
87% of cancer deaths (4). In particular, non–small cell lung
carcinoma (NSCLC) shows a strong etiologic association with
smoking. Nicotine in tobacco leads to tobacco addiction and
therefore represents an important target of investigation. Although
nicotine does not seem to be carcinogenic by itself, its metabolism
leads to the generation of potent carcinogens (5). In addition,
nicotine can stimulate cancer cell proliferation and angiogenesis
and suppress apoptosis induced by certain agents (6). Several lines
of evidence suggest that these effects by nicotine and its
derivatives are mediated by nicotinic acetylcholine receptors
(nAChR) expressed on the surface of tumor cells (7, 8). However,
the molecular mechanisms underlying the role that nicotine plays
in promoting lung cancer progression remain incompletely
elucidated.
Peroxisome proliferator–activated receptors (PPAR) are members of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily of liganddependent transcription factors. The major PPAR isoforms, a, h/y,
and g, each have distinct tissue and cellular distributions, different
modes of expression, and diverse agonist binding properties (9).
In contrast to PPARa and PPARg, the consequences of PPARh/y
activation are not well known (10). PPARh/y is expressed
throughout the body in most tissues (11), and it is linked to cell
proliferation, differentiation and survival, lipid metabolism, and
development (12, 13). Activation of PPARh/y has also been shown
to increase human cancer growth, including liver, colon, breast,
prostate, and lung (14–16), although opposite results have also
been observed (17, 18).
We recently showed that nicotine stimulated NSCLC cell
proliferation through nAChR-mediated signals that include activation
of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase and phosphatidylinositol
3-kinase (PI3K)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathways
(19). Here, we explore whether the effect of nicotine on
lung cancer cell growth is mediated through transcriptional activation of the PPARb/d gene. We found that nicotine increased
PPARh/y expression through a7 nAChR–mediated PI3K/mTOR
activation that reduced AP-2a and promoted tumor cell proliferation.

were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The PI3K inhibitors
LY294002 and wortmannin, a7 nAChR antagonist a-bungarotoxin, protein
kinase A (PKA) inhibitor H-89, and mTOR inhibitor rapamycin were obtained from Calbiochem. The a7 nAChR agonist PUN282987 was purchased
from TOCRIS Bioscience. Nicotine, Sp1 inhibitor mithramycin A, and other
chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich unless otherwise indicated.
Western blot analysis. The procedure was performed as previously
described (21). Briefly, cells were washed, lysed in 0.2 mL cell extraction
buffer, and sonicated. Equal amounts of protein were solubilized in 2 SDS
sample buffer, separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred onto
nitrocellulose, blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk containing 0.1% Tween
20 for 1 h at room temperature, and washed thrice with wash buffer (1
TBST). Blots were incubated with primary antibodies against PPARh/y, a7
nAChR, AP-2a, AP-2h, AP-2g, or Sp1 (1:1,000) overnight at 4jC, washed, and
incubated with secondary anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish
peroxidase (1:2,000 dilution; Cell Signaling) for 1 h at room temperature.
Blots were transferred to enhanced chemiluminescence solution (Pierce)
and exposed to X-ray film, and proteins were quantified by densitometric
scanning using a Bio-Rad GS-800 calibrated densitometer.
Immunoprecipitation assays. Proteins from NSCLC cells treated with
or without nicotine for 24 h were harvested in radioimmunoprecipitation
assay buffer (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), sonicated, and centrifuged at
12,000  g for 15 min at 4jC, and the supernatant was removed for

immunoprecipitation. Protein (200 Ag) was precleared for 30 min with 30 AL
of protein A/G Plus-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and incubated for
1 h at 4jC with appropriate antibodies (anti-PPARh/y and anti–a7 nAChR)
or normal IgG preabsorbed to protein A/G Plus-agarose. Immune
complexes were washed, mixed with SDS sample buffer, and analyzed by
Western blot.
Short interfering RNA treatment. The PPARh/y short interfering
RNA (siRNA), a7 nAChR siRNA, AP-2a siRNA, Sp1 siRNA, and control siRNA
were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Cells (70% confluence)
were transfected with PPARh/y, a7 nAChR, AP-2a, Sp1, or control siRNAs
using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen). Briefly, Lipofectamine
was incubated with serum-free medium for 5 min, mixed with siRNA
(100 nmol/L), incubated for 20 min at room temperature before the mixture
was diluted with medium, and added to cells. After culturing for 40 h, cells
were washed, resuspended in fresh medium, treated with or without
nicotine for an additional 24 h, and analyzed by Western blot and cell
viability assay.
Transient transfection assays. Human PPARh/y promoter deletion and
mutation constructs ligated to a luciferase reporter gene (pGL-PPARh/y
1880 luc, 587 luc, 455 luc, 227 luc) have been reported previously
(22). Briefly, NSCLC cells (5  105 per well, 50–60% confluence) were

Nicotine Stimulates Lung Cancer Proliferation via PPARb/d
reagent as previously described (23). In expression experiments, cells were
transfected with control pBABE puro or pBABEpuro PPARh/y plasmid
(2 Ag/well each) or with AP-2 expression reporter construct SP (RSV;
Addgene, Inc.; refs. 24, 25) for 24 h and treated with or without nicotine
(0.1 Amol/L) for an additional 24 h before luciferase activity was determined
using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter kit (Promega). Firefly luciferase activity
was normalized with Renilla luciferase activity within each sample.
Cell viability assay. NSCLC cells transfected with PPARh/y siRNAs for
40 h were exposed to nicotine (100 Amol/L) for an additional 72 h in 96-well
plates. Afterwards, cell viability was measured using the CellTiter-Glo
Luminescent Cell Viability Assay kit (Promega) and recorded as relative
luciferase units.
Electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Nuclear extracts from NSCLC
cells treated with or without nicotine were prepared for electrophoretic
mobility shift assay (EMSA) as described (23). Double-stranded oligonucleotides for AP-2 and Sp1 were as follows: wild-type AP-2, 5¶TCCTCCCCGCCTCCGC; mutant AP-2, TCCTCtttGCCTCCGC; wild-type
Sp1, 5¶-GGCCCCCACGGGCGGG; and mutant Sp1, 5¶-GGCCCCCACGGttGGG.
Nuclear protein (5 Ag) was incubated with 32P-labeled oligonucleotide probe
with or without AP-2a or Sp1 antibodies (2 Ag/AL). For cold competition,
100-fold excess of the respective unlabeled oligonucleotide was added before
adding probe. Mutated labeled oligonucleotide or 100-fold excess mutated or
nonmutated oligonucleotide was used as another control.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays were performed as previously described (26). Briefly,
cells were incubated in 1% formaldehyde for 10 min at 37jC, quenched with
125 mmol/L glycine, lysed in SDS buffer with protease inhibitors (Roche)
and 0.5 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and sonicated. Fragmented
chromatin was precleared by adding salmon sperm-DNA/protein A-agarose
beads. A portion of the supernatant was kept as ‘‘input’’ material. The
remaining cleared chromatin was incubated overnight with or without 5 Ag
of anti–AP-2a antibody or normal human IgG (Upstate Biotechnology).
DNA (10 Ag) from each immunoprecipitation was reserved for input
controls. DNA was purified with QIAquick PCR purification column
(Qiagen) and sequences of interest were amplified by PCR using the
following primers: forward ( 1683 to 1669 bp), 5¶-TCGGGCTCTAATATCCGCC; reverse ( 1543 to 1528 bp), 5¶-CCTCTCGTCGCACTGAAAC.

Statistical analysis. All experiments were repeated a minimum of three
times. All data were expressed as mean F SD. The data presented in some
figures are from a representative experiment that was qualitatively similar
in the replicate experiments. Statistical significance was determined with
Student’s t test (two tailed) comparison between two groups of data sets.
Asterisks shown in the figures indicate significant differences of
experimental groups in comparison with the corresponding control
condition (P < 0.05, see figure legends).

Results
Nicotine increases PPARB/D protein expression through A7
nAChR. Because of data implicating PPARh/y in NSCLC proliferation, we explored the role of this nuclear transcription factor in
mediating the effect of nicotine. We began by evaluating the
effect of nicotine on PPARh/y expression in NSCLC cells. Western
blot analysis revealed a time- and dose-dependent induction of
PPARh/y protein by nicotine with a significant increase at 24 hours
in the presence of 10 7 mol/L nicotine in H1838 cells (Fig. 1A).
Similar results were also observed in other NSCLC cells (Fig. 1B).
Having established that nicotine induces PPARh/y expression,
we set out to investigate the mechanisms responsible for nicotineinduced PPARh/y expression. We and others have reported
nicotine induction of a7 nAChR–dependent signals in several
cancer cell types, including lung cancer (6, 19). Thus, we speculated
that nicotine induces PPARh/y expression by activating a7
nAChRs. To test this, a-bungarotoxin, an inhibitor of a7 nAChR,
and PUN282987, a selective a7 nAChR agonist, were used. We
found that a-bungarotoxin, used at doses previously shown to be
noncytotoxic (19, 27), inhibited, whereas PUN282987 enhanced, the
effect of nicotine on PPARh/y protein expression (Fig. 1C, top).
Note that PUN282987 alone slightly induced PPARh/y protein
expression (Fig. 1C, top), although not as efficiently as nicotine.
Silencing a7 nAChR by siRNA also blocked the stimulatory effect of

H1838 cells treated with wortmannin (0.2 Amol/L) or H-89

nicotine on PPARh/y expression (Fig. 1C, bottom). Note that
control siRNA had no effect, and in line with other reports in lung
fibroblasts and human bronchial epithelial cells (28, 29), nicotine
stimulated the expression of a7 nAChR (Fig. 1C). Similar results
were also observed in H1792 NSCLC cells (Supplementary Fig. S1A
and C).
Next, we examined whether this process was associated with
PPARh/y and a7 nAChR protein-protein interactions. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments showed that the interaction between
PPARh/y and a7 nAChR was enhanced by nicotine (Fig. 1D). Note
that the control IgG had no effect (Fig. 1D).
PPARB/D siRNA attenuates, whereas overexpression of
PPARB/D enhances, the effect of nicotine on cell growth.
Because nicotine stimulates NSCLC cell proliferation, we set out to
examine the role of PPARh/y in this process. We found that the
stimulatory effect of nicotine on cell proliferation was significantly
reduced in cells silenced for the PPARb/d gene using PPARh/y
siRNA, whereas control siRNA had no effect (Fig. 2A). Note that
PPARh/y siRNA slightly reduced cell proliferation at baseline
(Fig. 2A). The PPARh/y expression vector induced proliferation
slightly but significantly enhanced the stimulatory effect of nicotine
(Fig. 2B). The control vector (p-BABEpuro) had no effect. Similar
results were also observed in H1792 NSCLC cells (Supplementary
Fig. S2A and B).
Involvement of PI3K and mTOR in the induction of
PPARB/D expression by nicotine. Because of the role of multiple
kinase signals in mediating the effect of nicotine on lung
carcinoma cell growth, we tested whether the regulation of
PPARh/y expression by nicotine was mediated by these pathways.
Western blot analysis revealed that nicotine-induced PPARh/y
protein expression was inhibited in the presence of the PI3K
inhibitors wortmannin (0.2 Amol/L) and LY294002 (25 Amol/L) and

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (16). August 15, 2009

the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin (20 nmol/L; Fig. 3A and B). These
findings indicate that the stimulatory effects of nicotine on
PPARh/y are associated with the activation of the PI3K and mTOR
signaling pathways. In contrast, the PKA inhibitor H-89
(10 Amol/L) had no effect (Fig. 3A). Similar results were also
observed in H1792 NSCLC cells (Supplementary Fig. S3).
Nicotine increases PPARB/D promoter activity. We next
examined whether the effects of nicotine on PPARh/y expression
occur at the transcriptional level. The PPARh/y gene promoter
contains multiple transcription factor binding sites, including AP-2,
AP-1, C/EBP, and Sp1 (Fig. 4A), and is differentially responsive to
various stimuli (22, 30). We found that H1838 cells transfected with
wild-type PPARh/y promoter (PPARh/y 1880) showed increased
reporter activity in response to nicotine; this was not observed with
the PPARh/y deletion promoter constructs (PPARh/y 587 and
445) lacking several distal AP-2 sites, suggesting a role for these
AP-2 sites (Fig. 4B). Interestingly, we found a significant induction
in PPARh/y promoter activity in cells transfected with the
PPARh/y 227 promoter construct, suggesting a role for Sp1
(Fig. 4B). This increase in PPARh/y promoter activity was reduced
by a-bungarotoxin, wortmannin, and rapamycin (Fig. 4C). Similar
results were also observed in H1792 NSCLC cells (Supplementary
Fig. S4B).
The role of AP-2 in mediating the effect of nicotine on
PPARB/D expression. To further define the effect of nicotine on
PPARh/y gene transcription, we tested the role of transcription
factors AP-2 and Sp1 in mediating the effect of nicotine. We
found that nicotine reduced AP-2a, whereas it had little effect on
AP-2h, AP-2g, and Sp1 protein expression (Fig. 5A, top). Note
that nicotine also reduced AP-2a mRNA levels (Supplementary
Fig. S5A). Silencing of AP-2a by siRNA enhanced the effect of
nicotine on PPARh/y protein expression (Fig. 5A, bottom) and

promoter activity (Fig. 5B, left). On the contrary, cells transfected
with the AP-2 expression construct SP(RSV)AP-2 had reduced
PPARh/y promoter activity and protein expression (Fig. 5B, right).
Note that control vector had no effect on other AP-2 family
members, such as AP-2h and AP-2g (data not shown). Next, gel
mobility shift assays showed that nicotine reduced AP-2 DNA
binding, which was blocked by wortmannin, LY294002, and
rapamycin (Fig. 5C). Furthermore, ChIP assay confirmed that
nicotine reduced AP-2a binding in the promoter of PPARb/d gene
(Fig. 5D). However, the use of anti-PPARh/y or AP-1 antibodies in
ChIP analysis (data not shown) did not show binding, suggesting
specificity of AP-2a binding. Similar results were also observed in
H1792 NSCLC cells (Supplementary Fig. S5A–D).
The role of Sp1 in modulating the effect of nicotine on
PPARB/D expression. We also assessed the role of Sp1 in the
induction of PPARh/y expression by nicotine. Interestingly, we
showed that the Sp1 inhibitor mithramycin A diminished the effect
of nicotine on PPARh/y and AP-2a protein expression (Fig. 6A, top)
and PPARh/y promoter activity (Fig. 6A, bottom). Similarly,
silencing of Sp1 by siRNA also abrogated the effect of nicotine
on PPARh/y promoter activity (Fig. 6B). This suggested that Sp1 is
required for mediating the full effect of nicotine on PPARh/y and

AP-2a. Furthermore, EMSA analysis showed increased Sp1 binding
to AP-2 promoter sequences (Fig. 6C, top) but not to Sp1 sequences
with nicotine treatment (Fig. 6C, bottom). Similar results were also
observed in H1792 NSCLC cell line (Supplementary Fig. S6A–C).

Discussion
Although nicotine is not a carcinogen by itself, it has been shown
to induce tumor cell proliferation and differentiation (31, 32). The
mitogenic effects of nicotine in NSCLC are analogous to those of
growth factors and involve activation of multiple signaling
pathways (7, 8). nAChRs seem to play an important role in
mediating the effects of nicotine on cell proliferation and survival.
Consistent with reports in lung fibroblasts and human bronchial
epithelial cells (28, 29), nicotine up-regulates a7 nAChR expression
in NSCLC cells, which could amplify the effects of nicotine. We
have reported that nicotine also stimulates NSCLC proliferation
through the induction of fibronectin, a matrix glycoprotein highly
expressed in acute and chronic forms of lung disease that has been
implicated in the biology of lung cancer (19).
Herein, we show that nicotine induces NSCLC cell proliferation
by stimulating the expression of PPARh/y. As a member of the

was isolated and sonicated, and chromatin was immunoprecipitated using antibodies against AP-2a protein (Anti-AP-2a ) or preimmune serum (Preimmune ). PCR
analysis indicates that AP-2a protein binds to the endogenous AP-2 site in this region of the PPARh/y promoter ( 1683/ 1528 bp). Non–AP-2 sequence was used as
control. Input, aliquot of the chromatin analyzed before immunoprecipitation.

Figure 6. The role of Sp1 in mediating the effect of nicotine on PPARh/y expression. A, top, protein from H1838 cells treated with mithramycin A (100 nmol/L) for
2 h before exposure to nicotine (0.1 Amol/L) for 24 h was analyzed by Western blot for PPARh/y and AP-2a. H1838 cells were transfected with wild-type PPARh/y
promoter construct (PPARh/y 1880 bp luc) and treated with or without mithramycin A (100 nmol/L) for 24 h followed by nicotine exposure for 24 h. Firefly/Renilla
luciferase activity was quantified. Columns, mean of at least four independent experiments; bars, SD. B, top, H1838 cells transfected with control or Sp1 siRNA
(100 nmol/L) for 30 h were analyzed by Western blot for Sp1 protein; bottom, H1838 cells transfected with control or Sp1 siRNA for 30 h were retransfected with
the wild-type PPARh/y promoter construct (PPARh/y 1880 bp luc) along with an internal control Renilla vector and treated with or without nicotine (0.1 Amol/L) for
an additional 24 h. The ratio of firefly/Renilla luciferase activity was quantified. Columns, mean of at least four independent experiments; bars, SD. *, significant increase
of activity compared with controls; **, significance of combination treatment compared with nicotine alone. C, top, AP-2 oligonucleotides were end labeled with
[g-32P]ATP and incubated with nuclear extracts (5 Ag) from H1838 cells treated with nicotine (0.1 Amol/L) for 24 h in the presence or absence of Sp1 antibody
(2 Ag/AL each); bottom, Sp1 oligonucleotides were end labeled with [g-32P]ATP and incubated with nuclear extracts (5 Ag) from H1838 cells treated with 0.1 Amol/L
nicotine for 24 h. For competition assays, a molar excess (100) of Sp1 (Cold Sp1 ) oligonucleotide was added to the binding reaction. Mutated Sp1 (Mut Sp1 )
oligonucleotides end labeled with [g-32P]ATP were used to confirm binding specificity. D, nicotine increases PPARh/y expression through a7 nAChR–mediated
activation of PI3K and mTOR pathways and inhibition of AP-2a expression and DNA binding activity in the PPARh/y gene promoter. Sp1 modulates these processes.
Nicotine also enhances the formation of a7 nAChR and PPARh/y protein complex. In turn, this may further stimulate NSCLC cell proliferation.

nuclear hormone receptor superfamily of transcription factors,
PPARh/y has been implicated in several processes, including
insulin sensitivity, terminal differentiation, and tumor growth (15,
20, 33). We report that silencing of PPARh/y inhibited, whereas
overexpression of PPARh/y enhanced, the mitogenic effect of
nicotine, showing a tumor-promoting role for PPARh/y in
mediating the effect of nicotine on cell growth. In line with this
finding, one recent study showed that PPARh/y is strongly
expressed in the majority of lung cancers, and activation of
PPARh/y induces NSCLC cell proliferation and survival (34). It
should be highlighted that results implicating PPARh/y activation
in the up-regulation of lung carcinoma cell growth (20, 34)
contradict those reported elsewhere in which a decrease in lung
cancer cell proliferation was observed (35). That particular work
was performed in another lung carcinoma cell line (A549) and with
the use of L-165041, a PPARh/y agonist. Note that L-165041 has
also been shown to act as an agonist to PPARg, which is known to
reduce tumor cell proliferation (36).
Our observations that PPARh/y and a7 nAChR interact and that
this is enhanced by nicotine are intriguing. This suggests the
possibility that some PPARh/y recycles to cytoplasm and interacts
with a7nAChR, which may be a potential mechanism for
enhancing the stimulatory effect of nicotine on cell growth. This
mechanism needs to be explored further.
The intracellular pathways mediating the effect of nicotine on
PPARh/y expression in NSCLC have not been elucidated. The PI3K/
Akt pathway is a critical pathway in cancer because it contributes
to tumor growth, invasion, metastasis, and tumor angiogenesis
(37). Therefore, targeting this pathway may represent an attractive
strategy for novel anticancer therapies. Akt serves at a key point in
the PI3K pathway and is likely important for the development and
maintenance of lung cancer (6). mTOR also plays a central role in
modulating cellular proliferation and angiogenesis in normal
tissues and neoplastic processes (38). Nicotine activation of Akt
increased phosphorylation of multiple downstream signals, including mTOR. Moreover, nicotine was found to stimulate Aktdependent proliferation in lung cancer cells (6). The current report
suggests that targeting these signaling pathways inhibits nicotineinduced PPARh/y expression. Together, our results highlight the
involvement of a7 nAChR and PI3K/mTOR signaling in mediating
the stimulatory effect of nicotine on PPARh/y expression.
Several transcription factor binding sites within regions of the
PPARh/y promoter have been characterized, including regulatory
elements for AP-2, C/EBP, and Sp1 (22, 30). Our findings show a
critical role for AP-2a in mediating the effect of nicotine on the
expression of PPARh/y. AP-2a proteins are essential biological
factors during development, cell growth, differentiation, and
apoptosis (39, 40). Loss of AP-2a expression has been associated
with several invasion- and metastasis-promoting events (39, 40).
Conversely, overexpression of AP-2a has been associated with
survival in colon cancer cells (41). Our results showed that a

reduction in AP-2a gene expression is needed for nicotine to
stimulate PPARh/y. Supershift and ChIP assays highlight the key
role of AP-2a transactivation in the regulation of PPARh/y
promoter activity by nicotine. Additional studies using site-directed
mutagenesis of key AP-2 sites are required to confirm their role in
nicotine-induced PPARh/y expression. However, this is consistent
with the work of others suggesting that AP-2 acts as a tumor
suppressor.
Interestingly, our results also suggested a role for Sp1 in
regulation of PPARh/y by nicotine. Sp1 regulates activation of
many genes involved in tumor growth, apoptosis, and angiogenesis.
Down-regulation of Sp1 activity inhibited urokinase receptor
expression and reduced the migration of breast cancer cells (42).
Here, mithramycin A, a Sp1 inhibitor (43), seemed to block
the inhibitory effect of nicotine on AP-2a protein expression via
inhibition of Sp1 activity. Of note, whereas the PPARh/y 227
promoter construct showed induction by nicotine, the PPARh/y
587 and 445 promoter constructs did not, suggesting the
presence of corepressors. Moreover, because nicotine induced the
interaction between Sp1 and the AP-2 cis-acting element,
additional mechanisms that enhance the effects of nicotine may
exist as shown in previous studies where Sp1 and AP-2 interaction
was required for gene expression (44, 45). Competitive binding
between Sp1 and other transcription factors has also been shown
to be important in the control of several other genes (46, 47).
Together, these studies suggest that the existence of functional Sp1
and its interaction with AP-2a influence the stimulatory effect of
nicotine on expression of PPARh/y.
In summary, we have shown that nicotine increases PPARh/y
expression through a7 nAChR–mediated activation of PI3K and
mTOR pathways and inhibition of AP-2a expression and DNA
binding activity in the PPARh/y gene promoter. Sp1 seems to
modulate these processes. Nicotine also enhances the formation of
the a7 nAChR-PPARh/y protein complex (Fig. 6D). To our
knowledge, this represents the first link between nicotine and the
PPARb/d gene, thereby unveiling a novel mechanism by which
nicotine stimulates NSCLC cell growth.
