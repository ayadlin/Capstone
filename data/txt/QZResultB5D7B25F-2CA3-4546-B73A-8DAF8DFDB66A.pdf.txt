Abstract
Malignant melanoma is a cancer that arises from melanocyte
cells in a complex but well-studied process, and which can
only be successfully treated prior to metastasis as it is highly
resistant to conventional therapies. A number of recent
reports have indicated that members of the HOX family of
homeodomain-containing transcription factors are deregulated in melanoma, and may actually be required to maintain
proliferation. In this report, we describe the use of a novel,
cell-permeable antagonist of the interaction between HOX
proteins and PBX, a second homeodomain-containing transcription factor that modifies HOX activity. This antagonist
can block the growth of murine B16 cells and trigger apoptosis
both in vitro and in vivo when administered to mice with flank
tumors. [Cancer Res 2007;67(12):5806–13]

Introduction
Melanoma is a cancer of the melanocytes, a population of
melanin-producing cells that reside in the epidermal basement
membrane of the skin (reviewed in ref 1). Its superficial location
often makes excision the first choice of treatment for malignant
melanoma, and is highly successful if done before malignant cells
have breached the epidermal basement membrane. After this event
though, malignant cells frequently and quickly metastasize,
spreading via the sentient lymph nodes to a variety of targets
including the lungs and brain. Despite considerable advances in
our understanding of melanoma genetics, thus far, there are no
effective treatments for metastatic melanoma, and the prognosis
after the disease has progressed to this stage is extremely poor (1).
In addition to genes that regulate the cell cycle and cell signaling
pathways, there is a growing interest in the deregulation of
transcription factors in melanoma. These include transcription
factors that have previously been identified as oncogenes, as well as
other transcription factors that are expressed primarily in
embryonic tissues but maybe re-expressed in malignant cells. Of
particular note are the HOX genes, a family of homeodomaincontaining transcription factors that determine the identity of cells
along different embryonic axes, including the developing nervous
system and limb (2). HOX gene deregulation has been observed in a
number of cancers (reviewed in ref 3), including melanomas (4–7).

Mammals have 39 HOX genes, many of which have partly or fully
redundant functions (2). For this reason, it has generally proven
difficult to fully assess the function of HOX genes in some contexts
using conventional genetic approaches. To overcome this difficulty,
we have designed a small, cell-permeable peptide (HXR9) that
antagonizes the interaction between HOX and a second transcription factor (PBX), which binds to HOX proteins in paralogue groups
1 to 8. HOX/PBX dimers have significantly greater binding affinity
and specificity for target DNA sequences than the HOX monomer
alone (8–10). Here, we show that HXR9 triggers apoptosis in
melanoma cells both in vitro and in vivo.

Materials and Methods
Culturing and maintenance of cell lines. B16F10 was cultured as
described previously (11). Briefly, cells were maintained in RPMI medium
(Life Technologies) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mmol/L of
L-glutamine (Life Technologies), and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Life
Technologies). Cells were maintained at 37jC in a 10% CO2 incubator.
‘‘Primary cells’’ were derived from a visceral malignant melanoma. This was
resected and half of the tissue was used to confirm the disease phenotype
through standard histopathologic techniques, whereas the second was
treated to separate individual cells. These cells were cultured using the same
conditions described above for B16F10 except that DMEM replaced RPMI.
Cord blood–derived CD133+ cells were enriched through positive
selection using a MiniMACS separation system (Miltenyi Biotec). Enriched
hematopoietic stem cells (HSC; 2  103) were suspended in 300 AL of
Iscove’s modified Dulbecco’s medium supplemented with 2% fetal bovine
serum (Life Technologies/Invitrogen) and were mixed vigorously with 3 mL
of MethoCult GF H4434 containing recombinant cytokines and erythropoietin (StemCell Technologies). Cells were incubated with 60 Amol/L of
HXR9 or CXR9 at the start of the experiment and the medium was changed
after 24 h (start of day 2).
In vitro treatments. Cells were plated at a density of 2.6  104 cells/mL
in six-well plates in 1.5 mL of media, and were allowed to adhere overnight.
Cells received 60 Amol/L of HXR9, or the control peptide CXR9 for 2 h, and
were harvested for subsequent analyses. For annexin V and nuclear staining,
B16 cells were plated at a density of 9  104 cells/mL in 25 cm2 culture
flasks. After 24 h of recovery, flasks for nuclear staining were treated as
mentioned above for 2 h. Then, cells were detached using trypsin/EDTA
solution (Sigma) and 200 AL aliquots were used to prepare cytospins at 800
rpm for 5 min using a Cytospin 4 (ThermoShandon). Cells used for annexin
V staining were treated with 60 Amol/L of HXR9 alone for 2 h or after the
pretreatment with Z-VAD-fmk (50 Amol/L; Bachem) for 45 min. RNA
extraction was done using a Qiagen kit.
cDNA synthesis. RNA was reverse-transcribed as described previously.
Briefly, RNA was first denatured by heating to 65jC for 5 min. One to five
micrograms of RNA was incubated in a volume of 50 AL at 37jC for 1 h with
final concentrations of 10 mmol/L of DTT, 1 mmol/L of deoxynucleotide
triphosphate mix, as well as 100 Ag/AL of poly-T primers, 200 units of reverse
transcriptase (Invitrogen), and 40 units of RNaseOUT (Invitrogen). The
cDNA synthesis reaction was terminated by placing tubes at 65jC for 5 min.
Real-time PCR. Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR was done using
the Stratagene MX4000 real-time PCR machine. The Stratagene MX4000

measures PCR product accumulation during the exponential phase of the
reaction, prior to the amplification becoming vulnerable to limited reagents
and cycling variability. Fluorescence increases in accordance with
increasing levels of PCR product.
Half-life determination of HXR9. Each peptide was added to freshly
prepared human plasma to a final concentration of 1 mmol/L in a total
volume of 40 AL. Samples were incubated at 37jC and reactions were
stopped by adding 60 AL of water and 0.9 mL of protein gel loading buffer
(Bio-Rad) containing 1% 2-mercaptoethanol, and heating to 95jC for 4 min.
Two microliters of each sample were run on a 22% acrylamide gel.
Analysis of cell death and apoptosis. The assessment of cell viability
was done using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (Promega), MTS (Promega) assay or the lactose dehydrogenase
(LDH) cytotoxicity detection kit (Roche) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Apoptotic morphology was determined using scanning
electron microscopy, fluorescence microscopy, and flow cytometry. Changes
in nuclear morphology were assessed by fixing B16 cytospins with ice-cold
methanol at room temperature for 5 min. The fixed cells were stained with
Hoechst 33258 (2 Ag/mL; Sigma) and mounted using Vectashield mounting
medium (Vector) and analyzed by fluorescence microscopy (Nikon Eclipse
TE 2000-S). B16 cells were also processed using the annexin V-FITC
apoptosis detection kit as described by the manufacturer (Oncogene
Research Products, Calbiochem). Samples were analyzed using a Beckman
Coulter Epics XL flow cytometer (argon laser, excitation wavelength 488 nm,
and used FL-1 and FL-3 detectors).
Silencing of c-Fos RNA. B16 cells were seeded at 3  104 cells/mL in a
96-well plate and allowed to recover for 24 h. Cells were pretreated with a
mixture of oligonucleotides complementary to Fos (asFos) or with a random,
noncoding oligonucleotides as a control (ascon) for 2 h at a final
concentration of 1 Amol/L. B16 cells were then treated with 60 Amol/L of
CXR9 or HXR9 for 2 h and the assessment of cell viability was done using the
LDH cytotoxicity detection kit. From these cells, the RNA was isolated and
samples analyzed by quantitative PCR.
Mice and in vivo trial. B16 cells in exponential growth phase were
injected s.c. at a dose of 1  106 cells into C57black/6 mice. Tumor growth was
monitored daily. Once tumors were established, mice received 10 mg/kg of
HXR9 or CXR9 i.v. via the tail vein, twice weekly (10 mice per group). Mice
were euthanized when tumor volume exceeded 1,200 mm3 and tumors were
excised and fixed for histopathologic analysis. Control groups received CXR9
and PBS accordingly.
Band shift assays. Whole protein extracts were made from excised
tumors and used with double-stranded oligonucleotide probes labeled with
streptavidin, based on previously described methods (4). The forward
sequences of these oligos were: HP (containing a HOX/PBX consensus
binding site)—GGACA AACTG AAGGC AGAGC TGATT TATGG CACAC
ACACA AGAAT GGACA AACCC GTGAG, HPC (containing an altered HOX/
PBX binding site as a control)—GGACA AACTG AAGGC AGAGC GCTCC
GTTAA CACAC ACACA AGAAT GGACA AACCC GTGAG. Complexes were
supershifted using the anti-PBX1,2,3 antibody (c-20; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at a dilution of 1:2,000.
Statistical analysis of the data. Data are given as means F SE of three
independent experiments. Comparison of treatments against controls was
made using one-way ANOVA followed by Fisher’s LSD post hoc test with the
SPSS statistical package. The significance level chosen was P < 0.05.

Results
HXR9: an antagonist of HOX/PBX interaction. In order to
block PBX-dependent HOX function, we designed a cell-permeable
peptide that mimics the ‘‘hexapeptide’’ sequence found in HOX
proteins of paralogue groups 1 to 9 (8–10, 12–16). The rationale for
this design was that HXR9 should act as a specific, competitive
inhibitor of the HOX/PBX interaction, and thus prevent HOX/PBX
dimers from binding to DNA. For cell penetration, the hexapeptide
was linked to a polyarginine (R9) sequence, which has previously
been shown to act as an efficient peptide delivery system (17). As a

www.aacrjournals.org

control, we designed a second peptide, CXR9, which lacks a
functional hexapeptide portion. In order to increase the stability of
these peptides, the NH2-terminal- and COOH-terminal–most
amino acids were synthesized as D-isomers.
The stability of the peptides was assessed by incubating each
with human plasma at 37jC. The amounts of peptide remaining
after different lengths of time were assessed by SDS-PAGE, and
indicated that the half-life of both HXR9 and CXR9 was f12 h
(Supplementary data 1).
In order to test the specificity of HXR9, we treated murine B16
melanoma cells with 60 Amol/L of HXR9 or CXR9 for 1 h and
extracted protein from the cells. HOXD9, a known PBX-binding
partner that is expressed in melanoma (7), was then immunoprecipitated using an anti-PBX antibody. This technique permits the
recovery of HOXD9 in CXR9-treated cells but not in HXR9-treated
cells, indicating that HXR9 does indeed block the interaction
between PBX and HOX (Fig. 1A). As a further control on specificity,
we also immunoprecipitated the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). This
binds to PBX through an interaction that does not depend on the
presence of the hexapeptide motif in the GR protein (18), and thus,
this particular interaction should not be blocked by HXR9, and
indeed, it is not (Fig. 1A).
As an additional test of the peptide’s selectivity, we studied its
binding to a double-stranded DNA probe containing a HOX/PBX
consensus binding site. If the hexapeptide does prevent the
interaction of HOX and PBX, it should also disrupt the binding
of these proteins to HOX/PBX DNA consensus sites. In order to test
this, a band-shift type assay was used. B16 cells were treated with
60 Amol/L of HXR9 or CXR9 for 1 h, and then a cell-free extract was
prepared. A streptavidin-labeled DNA probe was added that
contains either a HOX/PBX consensus site (HP) or a modified
sequence that does not match the consensus site (HPC; Fig. 1B).
The addition of the HP probe to the CXR9 or control B16 lysates,
followed by resolution on a nondenaturing acrylamide gel resulted
in a significant reduction in mobility. This indicates that one or
more proteins had bound to it. In order to characterize these
proteins, a ‘‘supershift’’ assay was done, whereby an anti-PBX
antibody was added to the lysate. This resulted in a further shift in
mobility equivalent to a single antibody molecule binding, and
indicating that each probe-binding protein complex contains a
single PBX protein.
Importantly, whereas proteins in the cellular extracts from
untreated and CXR9-treated cells bound to the probe, those from
the HXR9 extracts did not. This suggests that HXR9 does indeed
prevent the formation of HOX/PBX dimers and their subsequent
binding to DNA.
In order to confirm that HXR9 can penetrate B16F10 cells, we
used an anti-HXR9 antibody combined with the fluorescent FITC
tag to examine its intracellular distribution (Fig. 1D). This shows
that HXR9 is present both in the cytoplasm and the nucleus.
HXR9 triggers apoptosis in B16 and primary melanoma
cells. We investigated the antiproliferative activity of HXR9 on B16
cells. The IC50 for HXR9 and CXR9 were found to be 20 and 200
Amol/L, respectively. Cells treated with 60 Amol/L of HXR9 for
2 h exhibited a notable change in morphology, including a
reduction in dendritic processes (data not shown). Staining with
Hoechst dye also revealed a large number of HXR9-treated cells
displaying nuclear apoptotic morphology (chromatin condensation; Fig. 2A). An additional sign of apoptosis is the appearance
of phosphatidylserine in the cytoplasmic surface of the cell
membrane (19). This can be detected by fluorescently labeled

Figure 1. The specificity of hexapeptide
action. A, HXR9 blocks the binding of
HOXD9 to PBX. B16 murine melanoma
cells were treated with 60 Amol/L of HXR9
or CXR9 for 4 h. Protein was then extracted
from these cells using standard methods,
and PBX proteins were precipitated using
an anti-PBX antibody. Precipitates were
probed for HOXD9, GR, and PBX. HXR9
blocks the binding of PBX to HOXD9
but not to GR. B, HXR9 prevents the
formation of HOX/PBX/DNA complexes
in cultured B16 cells. Double-stranded
oligodeoxynucleotide probes were
incubated in protein extracted from B16
cells. One of these probes (HP ) contained
a HOX/PBX consensus binding region
(in boldface)—5¶ CTGTTTGATT
TATTTGTTTA 3¶. A second, control probe
(HPC ) contained an altered HOX/PBX
binding site that was not predicted to
bind HOX and PBX proteins—5¶
CTGTTACTGA CGATTGTTTA 3¶. The
cells were treated for 2 h with 60 Amol/L of
HXR9 (H ) or with 60 Amol/L of CXR9 (C),
or were untreated (U). Protein extracted
from cells treated with the control CXR9
peptide caused a mobility shift in HP
(lane 2 ) that could be abolished by 25-fold
excess unlabeled HP (lane 8), and
enhanced (supershifted) by anti-PBX
antibody (lane 14). This supershift was
abolished by the inclusion of a blocking
peptide that prevented anti-PBX antibody
from binding to PBX (lanes 16–18).
The mobility of HPC was unchanged by
incubating with the protein extract
(lane 11 ). Protein extracted from
HXR9-treated cells did not change the
mobility of HP (lane 3) or HPC (lane 12 ),
and the mobility of HP was also
unchanged in response to unlabeled probe
(lane 9 ) or anti-PBX antibody (lane 15 ).
C, HXR9 prevented the formation of
HOX/PBX/DNA complexes in tumors.

antibody labeled with the FITC fluorescent
probe (green, Anti-HXR9-FITC ), with
Hoechst (blue, Hoechst ), or with a
combination (Combined ). As a negative
control, B16F10 cells that had not been

Annexin V protein and cell sorting using fluorescence-activated cell
sorting. Using this technique with B16F10 cells treated for 2 h with
60 Amol/L of HXR9 revealed that a significant proportion of cells
were in late phases of apoptosis (Fig. 2B). A significant protection
from HXR9-induced cell death by apoptosis was observed by the
pretreatment of B16F10 cells with the pan-caspase inhibitor
Z-VAD-fmk (Fig. 2B). CXR9 had no effect on proliferation and did
not cause apoptosis.
In addition to the derived B16 murine melanoma cells, we also
tested the ability of HXR9 to trigger apoptosis in primary
melanoma cells derived from a human malignant melanoma
removed for histologic analysis. Cells were separated from this
tissue and cultured until they reached 80% confluence and then
treated with 60 Amol/L of HXR9 for 2 h, after which they exhibited
morphology consistent with cell death (Fig. 2C). Staining of nuclei
with Hoechst dye also revealed the presence of apoptotic
morphology (Fig. 2C). Additionally, an IC50 determination for
HXR9 was done using the LDH cytotoxicity assay. This revealed
that the IC50 for the cells was 50 Amol/L.
HXR9 causes specific transcriptional changes. In order to
examine changes in gene transcription on HXR9 treatment, B16F10
cells were treated for 2 h with 60 Amol/L of HXR9 or CXR9. RNA
was extracted for analysis by Microarray, using the Mouse Genome
430A 2.0 Array (Affymetrix), which contains 14,000 characterized
mouse genes. Although the majority of genes failed to show any
significant changes in transcription, 22 showed an increase in
transcription (P < 0.05). Most notably, these included oncogenes
Fos and Jun. In order to confirm that these genes were up-regulated
in HXR9-treated B16 cells, quantitative PCR was used to measure
the relative number of transcripts in RNA extracted from cells
(Fig. 3A); this confirmed that Fos, Jun, Dusp1, and Atf1 were all
significantly up-regulated in response to HXR9.
HXR9 blocks tumor growth and triggers apoptosis in vivo.
The B16 F10 murine tumor is a well-established experimental
in vivo model of melanoma, and is also one of the most aggressive
murine tumors (20, 21). Subcutaneous inoculation was used to
introduce 1  105 cells, and mice were treated with twice weekly i.v.
doses of HXR9 or CXR9 at 10 mg/kg once tumors were palpable
(10 mice per group). At the end point of these experiments, HXR9treated tumors showed a significant degree of growth retardation
(Fig. 4A), and histologic analyses of excised tumors revealed a significantly higher level of cell death in HXR9-treated mice (Fig. 4B).
In order to assess whether the hexapeptide could block HOX/
PBX binding in vivo, tumors were injected directly with HXR9 at
10 mg/kg, and were then used to produce nuclear lysates 2 h after
treatment. Band shift assays (as detailed above) revealed that
protein extracted from these tumors could not bind a DNA probe
containing a HOX/PBX consensus binding site, whereas an
equivalent extract from CXR9-treated tumors could (Fig. 1C), indicating that HXR9 specifically disrupts the formation of HOX/PBX/
DNA complexes in vivo. Quantitative PCR analysis of RNA extracted
from these tumors revealed that Fos, Jun, Dusp1, and Atf3 were
up-regulated, mirroring those results obtained in vitro (Fig. 3B).
Up-regulation of Fos is a key event in HXR9-mediated
apoptosis. Previous studies have suggested that an increase in
Fos transcription could trigger apoptosis (22–29). We therefore tested whether Fos up-regulation might be responsible for
HXR9-mediated apoptosis by ablating Fos RNA in B16 cells prior to
HXR9 treatment by incubating cells with a mixture of antisense
oligonucleotides that were complementary to Fos (asFos), and with
a second set of random, noncoding oligonucleotides as a control

(ascon). Treatment with the former caused a reduction in Fos mRNA
in HXR9-treated cells to a level that was equivalent to that found in
CXR9-treated cells, whereas the ascon set did not (Fig. 5A). This
reduction in the number of Fos transcripts resulted in a partial but
significant protection from HXR9-induced cell death (Fig. 5B).
HXR9 does not trigger apoptosis in CD133+ cells derived
from human umbilical cord blood. A number of previous studies
have indicated that HOX genes are essential in the correct
proliferation and differentiation of blood progenitor cells. In
particular, HOXB4 has been shown to promote the proliferation of
highly purified populations of HSC (30, 31). In light of these
observations, we decided to test the toxicity of HXR9 on a
population of cells affinity-purified from human umbilical cord
blood using CD133, a marker of primitive blood progenitor cells
(32). CD133+ cells continued to proliferate when treated with

HXR9, although at a lower rate than CXR9-treated cells (Fig. 6), and
no significant differences in cell death were observed for the two
treatments (data not shown).
No overt toxicity was apparent in HXR9-treated mice. HXR9
toxicity was assessed by i.v. administration to MF-1 mice at 15 mg/kg
for 10 days. As HOX gene function is important in hemopoiesis, close
attention was paid to potential adverse affects in the bone marrow
and peripheral blood. Peripheral blood samples were taken prior to
administering HXR9. After 10 days of treatment consisting of daily
i.v. doses of 15 mg/kg, no adverse side effects were seen in HXR9or CXR9-treated mice. Full blood counts were within expected
reference ranges seen in the strain of mice used, and histologic
analysis of the liver also revealed no abnormalities (data not shown).

Discussion
In this study, we have shown that antagonizing the interaction
between HOX and PBX proteins triggers apoptosis in malignant
melanoma cells, both in vitro and in vivo. HOX genes are also known
to promote the proliferation of normal HSCs however, raising the
possibility that antagonizing the same interaction in these cells
could likewise be cytotoxic (30, 31). Our findings indicate that this is
not the case though, as purified HSC populations continue to
proliferate even in the presence of HXR9, and that there is no overt
toxicity observed in mice. These findings concur with previous work
indicating that a mutant version of HOXB4 lacking a functional
hexapeptide was actually more effective in promoting HSC
proliferation than the wild-type sequence (33). Taken together,
these results suggest that targeting the interaction between HOX
and PBX could be selective for the malignant phenotype, in a way
that direct knockout of HOX genes would not.

How does antagonizing the HOX/PBX interaction trigger
apoptosis in B16 melanoma cells? Microarray analysis of cells
treated with HXR9 has identified a number of target genes that
become dysregulated, including the oncogene c-Fos, the expression
of which increases 2.6-fold 2 h after HXR9 treatment. This increase
in c-Fos transcription must be at least partly responsible for the
induction of apoptosis, as knocking down its expression in B16
melanoma cells results in a considerable reduction in their
sensitivity to HXR9. Fos and its binding partner Jun are both
members of the bZIP superfamily of transcription factors, which
are characterized by a basic DNA-binding domain combined with a
leucine zipper region (34). JUN can homodimerize to form the
activator protein (AP-1) transcription factor. FOS cannot homodimerize, but it could also form part of the AP-1 transcription factor
by binding JUN. AP-1 activates the expression of a number of genes
involved in cell cycle regulation, including cyclin D1 (35).
Conversely, AP-1 also mediates apoptosis in a wide range of cell
types including lymphocytes, fibroblasts, neurons, and retinal cells
(22–29). The mechanistic basis of AP-1–mediated apoptosis is
unclear, and depends in part on the actual composition of the AP-1
dimer. Jun-containing AP-1 can promote the transcription of the
Fas ligand (FasL), which promotes cell death through the FasL/Fas
receptor pathway in lymphocytes, fibroblasts, and neurons (22–26).
Fos overexpression induces apoptosis in hepatocytes (36), and is
also required for Myc-induced cell death in hepatoma cells (37).
Furthermore, the re-expression of Fos in a number of established
tumor cell lines can be anti-oncogenic through the activation of
proapoptotic genes, although this seems to involve a different
mechanism from that used by Jun (38).
In addition to c-Fos, a number of other target genes are also
up-regulated by HXR9, of which Dusp1 and Atf3 show by far the

HXR9. B16 cells were pretreated
with control noncoding oligonucleotides
(ascon ) or with a mixture of antisense
oligonucleotides complementary to Fos
(asFos ) for 2 h before treatment with
60 Amol/L of CXR9 or HXR9 for 2 h.

greatest increase. The former encodes a dual specificity phosphatase, a protein that can remove phosphate residues from
serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues of a wide range of substrates and can block signaling through the mitogen-activated
kinase pathway, thereby blocking cellular proliferation (reviewed
in ref. 39). Atf3 is a member of the activating transcription factor/
cyclic AMP–responsive element binding protein family of trans-

cription factors that are known for their role in stress response,
including DNA damage (40). It has recently been shown that Atf3
can stabilize p53 by preventing its ubiquitination (41), and
promote its tumor suppressor functions, including the induction
of apoptosis (42). Atf3 also promotes cell cycle arrest and
apoptosis in UV-treated fibroblast cells, and blocks Ras-mediated
transformation (43).

cells purified from umbilical cord blood
were cultured for 8 d with an initial dose of
60 Amol/L of HXR9 or CXR9, and the
increase in cell numbers over this time was
measured. Columns, means of three
experiments; bars, SE.

Targeting HOX/PBX Dimers in Melanoma

Many of the other target genes identified in the screen also have
antitumor properties. Kruppel-like factor 4 is a transcription factor
that is known to be down-regulated in many colorectal cancers,
inhibits the activity of the oncogenic transcription factor h-catenin,
and prevents xenograft tumor growth in athymic nude mice (44).
Mad is an inhibitor of another oncogenic transcription factor, myc,
and also has a role in blocking proliferation (reviewed in ref. 45).
Finally, Drak2 is a serine/threonine kinase with a high degree of
sequence and functional homology to the death-associated kinases
involved in apoptosis, and can induce apoptosis when overexpressed in NIH 3T3 cells (46).
The predominance of tumor suppressor and proapoptotic genes
among HXR9 targets, together with the ability of HXR9 to induce
apoptosis in B16 melanoma cells, suggests that the function of HOX
gene expression may itself be to inhibit the intrinsic tumor–

suppressing pathways. The relative importance of these targets is
likely to vary from one cell type to another depending on the
genetic background, but a generalized inhibition of many tumor
suppressing pathways could account for the wide range of tumors
that overexpress HOX genes. Together with the data presented here
showing that HXR9 could selectively kill malignant cells, these
observations suggest that the HOX/PBX interaction may present an
important target in cancer therapy.
