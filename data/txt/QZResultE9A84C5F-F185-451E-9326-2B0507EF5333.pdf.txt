Abstract
Evidence indicates that the induction of cyclooxygenase-2
(COX-2) and high prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) levels contribute to
the pathogenesis of non–small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In
addition to overproduction by COX-2, PGE2 concentrations
also depend upon the levels of the PGE2 catabolic enzyme
15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (15-PGDH). We find
a dramatic down-regulation of PGDH protein in NSCLC cell
lines and in resected human tumors when compared with
matched normal lung. Affymetrix array analysis of 10 normal
lung tissue samples and 49 resected lung tumors revealed a
much lower expression of PGDH transcripts in all NSCLC
histologic groups. In addition, treatment with the epidermal
growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR TKI)
erlotinib increased the expression of 15-PGDH in a subset of
NSCLC cell lines. This effect may be due in part to an
inhibition of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)
pathway as treatment with mitogen-activated protein kinase
kinase (MEK) inhibitor U0126 mimics the erlotinib results. We
show by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR that the
transcript levels of ZEB1 and Slug transcriptional repressors
are dramatically reduced in a responsive cell line upon EGFR
and MEK/ERK inhibition. In addition, the Slug protein, but
not ZEB1, binds to the PGDH promoter and represses
transcription. As these repressors function by recruiting
histone deacetylases to promoters, it is likely that PGDH is
repressed by an epigenetic mechanism involving histone
deacetylation, resulting in increased PGE2 activity in tumors.
This effect is reversible in a subset of NSCLC upon treatment
with an EGFR TKI. [Cancer Res 2007;67(12):5587–93]

Introduction
Non–small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the leading cause of
cancer-related death in the United States, with low 5-year survival
rates of 12% to 15% (1). Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), one of the major
metabolites of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), is overproduced in many

human solid tumors, including lung cancer, and has been associated
with increased tumor angiogenesis, metastasis, apoptosis, cell cycle
regulation, and immune suppression (2). Intratumoral PGE2 levels
depend not only upon the rate of production but also on the rate of
its degradation. The enzyme responsible for the degradation of
PGE2 is 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (15-PGDH; ref. 3),
and recent publications have shown that down-regulation of
15-PGDH is associated with multiple cancer types (4–7). Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) and Northern blots
comparing matched normal and tumor tissues suggest that downregulation is occurring at the transcriptional level (6, 7). Interestingly, treatment of colon carcinoma cells with epidermal growth
factor (EGF) reduced the PGDH protein levels in some cell lines (6).
In this same study, treatment with the EGF receptor (EGFR)–
specific inhibitor erlotinib negated the effects of EGF and increased
the protein levels of PGDH above control colon cancer cells.
In our examination of NSCLC, we show that 15-PGDH protein
and mRNA are down-regulated in multiple subtypes of NSCLC.
Notably, erlotinib treatment of NSCLC significantly elevates
15-PGDH protein levels in subset of NSCLC cell lines. We show
that the mechanism for this up-regulation operates through the
mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. Interestingly,
treatment with either erlotinib or a MAPK kinase (MEK) inhibitor
decreases transcript levels of the transcriptional repressors ZEB1
and Slug in an erlotinib-responsive cell line but not in a cell line
where 15-PGDH levels remain unchanged with erlotinib treatment.
Although both ZEB1 and Slug expression is reduced, we were only
able to show Slug binding to the PGDH promoter. In addition, only
Slug had the ability to regulate transcriptional activity of the PGDH
promoter. These results strongly imply that the transcriptional
repressor Slug is important for the regulation of 15-PGDH in a
subset of NSCLC.

Materials and Methods
Reagents. Erlotinib was generously provided by Genentech. U0126,
trichostatin A (TSA), and anti-h-actin were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.
LY294002 was purchased from Calbiochem. Anti-COX-2 was purchased
from Cayman Chemical, and anti-E-cadherin, anti–phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (anti-pERK), and anti-ERK were from Cell
Signaling Technologies.

with BamHI and subcloned into pFLAG-CMV-2 (Sigma) to generate FLmZEB. pCMV-Sport6-human Slug and pPCR-BluntII-TOPO-human ZEB1
constructs were purchased from Open Biosystems. These constructs were
sequence from the 5¶ and 3¶ ends to verify the presence of an insert and the
identity of that insert. Human Slug was released from pCMV-Sport6 with
BamHI and placed into pFLAG-CMV-2 to create FL-hSlug. A NotI/BamHI
digest removed human ZEB1 from pPCR-BluntII-TOPO, which was
subsequently subcloned into pCMV5N. pCMV5N is a modified pCMV5
vector in which a NotI linker was inserted into the MluI site. To create FLhSlug, a PCR product was generated using pCMV-Sport6-hSlug as a
template and the following primers: hSlug165F, 5¶-GACGGATCCACCATGCCGCGCTCCTTCCTGGTCAAG-3¶; hSlug971R, 5¶-GACGGATCCTCAGTGTGCTACACAGCAGCCAGA. The human PGDH promoter region
from bases 626 to +1 was amplified by PCR using the genomic DNA of
NSCLC cell line H3255 with primers PGDHpr-626F (5¶-CAGACGCGTCAGGTTTTCAGGACAGAGCAGAG-3¶) and PGDHpr+1R (5¶-CAGCTCGAGTGGTGCAGCCACTGCTGGG-3¶). The resulting product was subcloned into the
MluI and XhoI cut pGL3 basic (Promega) to create PGDH/pGL3. All PCR
products were sequenced to verify that there were no PCR-generated
mutations.
Microarray analysis. Primary lung cancers were obtained with informed
consent from 49 patients (23 female and 26 male; median age, 64.8 years;
range, 35–84 years) who underwent thoracotomy at Vanderbilt University
Hospital. All clinical and pathologic information was obtained from medical
records. Each tumor was classified by histologic subtype according WHO
classification (8) by an expert pulmonary pathologist. All samples were
frozen immediately after resection and stored in liquid nitrogen until
extracting RNA with an RNeasy Micro kit according to manufacturer’s
instructions with Dnase I treatment. All the steps related to the microarray
analysis were carried out in Vanderbilt Microarray Resource Core Lab with
Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus2.0 chips (Affymetrix). After obtaining
microarray data through GCOS software (Affymetrix), Gene traffic
(Stratagene) was used to normalize data with the RMA method by taking
average of a pooled, normal lung, total RNA control (BD Clontech) and nine
normal tissues as the baseline.
Treatment of cell lines with EGF and inhibitors. For all cell culture
experiments, erlotinib, U0126, and LY294002 were dissolved in 100% DMSO.
Subconfluent cultures were serum starved overnight followed by addition of
EGF (100 ng/mL). One hour after EGF addition, inhibitors were added. The
cells were then harvested at various time points after treatment and lysed
with modified radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (1 PBS, 0.5%
sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1% NP40, and protease inhibitors).
Erlotinib, U0126, and LY294002 treatments were allowed to proceed for
10 to 12 h before cells were harvested. For TSA treatment, A549 and H1435
cells at f70% to 80% confluence were treated with vehicle (DMSO) or
300 nmol/L TSA for 20 and 48 h. Cells were harvested, and PGDH protein
levels were examined by Western blot as described.
Western blots. Proteins were separated on 4% to 20% or 10% SDS
polyacrylamide gels and transferred to Hybond-ECL nitrocellulose (GE
Healthcare Biosciences) or Immobilon P (Millipore). Membranes were then
blocked in 5% milk in TBS, 0.1% Tween 20 and incubated with primary
antibody (15-PGDH, 1:15,000; pERK, 1:1,000; ERK, 1:1,000; and E-cadherin,
1:1,000) overnight at 4jC. The h-actin antibody (1:5,000) was typically
incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The membranes were then treated
with horseradish peroxidase–conjugated secondary antibody and developed
using chemiluminescent detection reagent (Pierce Chemical).
PGE2 assay. PGE2 was measured in culture medium by enzyme
immunoassay per the manufacturer’s instructions (Cayman Chemical).
Briefly, 2.5  105 cells were seeded per well into six-well dishes and allowed
to grow overnight. Cells were serum starved for 16 to 20 h followed by
addition of EGF (100 ng/mL). One hour after addition of EGF, erlotinib or
vehicle was added. Ten hours after addition of EGF, arachidonic acid was
added to a final concentration of 0.1 mmol/L. Two hours later, medium was
harvested for PGE2 assay, and cells were harvested for protein determination by detergent-compatible protein assay (Bio-Rad). The amount of PGE2
in the medium was normalized to protein. Cell lysates were examined by
Western blot as described to determine protein levels of COX-2 and PGDH.

Real-time RT-PCR. Total RNA was extracted from cell lines with a
VersaGene RNA isolation kit (Gentra Systems). cDNA was synthesized using
an Invitrogen Superscript III First-strand synthesis system (Invitrogen). For
real-time PCR, relative gene expression was determined using QuantiTect
SYBR Green PCR kit (Qiagen) on a Bio-Rad iCycler (Bio-Rad Laboratories).
Primer pairs specific for ZEB, Slug, Snail, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
dehydrogenase (GAPDH), and PCR reaction conditions are as follows:
ZEB1F, 5¶-AGCAGTGAAAGAGAAGGGAATGC-3¶; ZEB1R, 5¶-GGTCCTCTTCAGGTGCCTCAG-3¶; SlugF, 5¶-AATATGTGAGCCTGGGCGC-3¶; SlugR,
5¶-CTCTGTTGCAGTGAGGGCAAG-3¶; SnailF, 5¶-CGCGCTCTTTCCTCGTCAG-3¶; SnailR, 5¶-TCCCAGATGAGCATTGGCAG-3¶; GAPDHF, 5¶-TGCACCACCAACTGCTTAGC-3¶; GAPDHR, 5¶-GGCATGGACTGTGGTCATGAG-3¶;
40 cycles at 95jC for 30 s, 60jC for 30 s, and 72jC for 30 s, and 75jC for 10 s.
The quantitative RT-PCR for each treatment was done in triplicate, and the
average C t was determined. The relative gene expression, normalized to
GAPDH and based on three separate experiments for H1435 and five
experiments for A549, was calculated using the 2-DC t method as described in
Livak and Schmittgen (9).
Electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Cos7 cells were transfected with
either pFLAG-CMV-2 (Sigma) or with FL-mZEB1 or FL-hSlug using
LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer’s instructions.
Forty-eight hours after transfection, the nuclear lysates were prepared by
the method of Schreiber et al. (10). Three oligonucleotides that span each of
three E-boxes in the 15-PGDH promoter were made according to the
sequences described in Mann et al. (5). Oligonucleotides were end-labeled
using T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs) and purified using
the Nucleotide Removal kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer’s
instructions, with the exception that the oligonucleotides were eluted from
the spin column in 100 AL of 10 mmol/L Tris (pH 8). Sense and antisense
labeled oligonucleotides were added together and allowed to anneal at
room temperature for 20 to 30 min before adding to binding reactions.
Unlabeled competitors were diluted in 10 mmol/L Tris and added together
and allowed to anneal as described for the labeled oligonucleotides.
Unlabeled competitor, specific or nonspecific at 50-fold molar excess, or
antibodies, anti-FLAG (Sigma) or anti-HA (Covance, Denver, PA), 2 Ag of
each, were added to the binding reactions 5 min before the labeled
oligonucleotides and allowed to incubate at room temperature. The 1
binding buffer was 20 mmol/L HEPES (pH 7.9), 60 mmol/L KCl, 0.1 mmol/L
EDTA, 2 mmol/L DTT, 10% glycerol (Sigma), and 1 mg poly(deoxyinosinicdeoxycytidylic acid) (GE Healthcare). Following addition of the labeled
oligonucleotides, the reactions remained at room temperature for 30 min.
Reactions were added directly to a 5% non-denaturing acrylamide gel for
separating complexes.
Transcription assay. PGDH/pGL3 was cotransfected into NIH3T3 cells
with TK-pRL (Promega) and varying amounts of pFLAG-CMV-2 (Sigma),
pCMV-Sport6-hSlug (Open Biosystems), FL-mZEB, or pCMV5-hZEB so
that the total DNA amount remained constant at 2 Ag. Transfections
were done in six-well dishes (Becton Dickinson) using Superfect reagent
(Qiagen) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Cells were harvested
48 h after transfection and assayed for luciferase activity using the Dual
Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega) following the manufacturer’s
protocol.
Statistical analysis. Data were analyzed by the Student’s t test. All data
were expressed as means F SE, and differences were considered statistically
significant when the P < 0.05.

Results and Discussion
The level of PGE2 within a tissue is determined by a fine balance
of synthesis and degradation (6). NAD+-dependent 15-PGDH is an
enzyme that catabolizes prostaglandins and is the main enzyme
responsible for the elimination of PGE2 from tissues (3). To
investigate whether 15-PGDH is down-regulated in NSCLC, we
examined 15-PGDH protein levels in 39 lung cancer cell lines and 6
paired normal lung versus lung tumor tissues by Western blotting
(Fig. 1A and B; Supplementary Table S1). Representing all NSCLC

subtypes, we found that 36 of these 39 cell lines have dramatically
decreased 15-PGDH protein, with only three cell lines expressing
modest levels of 15-PGDH. In addition, the 15-PGDH protein
level was clearly decreased in the tumor tissue of the six paired
normal versus tumor patient samples independent of the histology
(3 adenocarcinoma and 3 squamous cell carcinoma; Fig. 1B).
Comparison of the PGDH transcript levels in a pooled normal lung
RNA sample (BD Clontech) and nine normal lung tissues to 49
freshly resected NSCLC specimens using Affymetrix microarray
analysis revealed that almost all of the tumors expressed lower
levels of 15-PGDH mRNA (Fig. 1C). These data show that 15-PGDH
is frequently and significantly down-regulated in all subtypes of
lung cancers, suggesting that loss of 15-PGDH is an early and
important event, and that this protein may have tumor suppressor
activity (5–7).
Several lines of evidence are increasingly linking prostaglandins
with modulation of EGFR signaling. Therapeutic targeting of the
EGFR with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors, such as erlotinib, has
achieved beneficial results in unselected NSCLC patients (11). This
has included dramatic responses, most often observed in patients
with EGFR mutant tumors, as well as clinically significant
stabilization of disease, often observed in patients without EGFR
mutant tumors. Because of the previous work detailing the effects
of EGF and erlotinib on 15-PGDH protein and message levels in

colon cancer cell lines (6), we hypothesized that a portion of the
benefit from erlotinib in lung cancer might come from modulation
of PGE2 levels as a consequence of elevation of 15-PGDH
expression. We therefore examined the effects of erlotinib on 15PGDH expression in seven human lung cancer cell lines. We found
that treatment with erlotinib significantly increased 15-PGDH
protein expression in a number of the treated cell lines, which
included H1435, H1648, and H3255 cells (Fig. 2A, top; Supplementary Fig. S1A). The A549 and H2122 cell lines are examples of
NSCLC cell lines that do not up-regulate 15-PGDH in response to
erlotinib treatment (Fig. 2A, bottom; Supplementary Fig. S1B).
The average overall increase in 15-PGDH protein expression was
2.5-fold (Supplementary Fig. S1C). These data show that inhibition
of EGFR pathway in NSCLC significantly elevated 15-PGDH protein
levels in a subset of human lung cancer cells. Thus, alteration in the
prostaglandin metabolic pathway may play a role in the benefits of
erlotinib treatment.
We next determined the mechanism by which inhibition of the
EGFR was increasing 15-PGDH levels. The downstream signaling
pathways from the EGFR, including the phosphatidylinositol-3
kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/AKT) and the Ras/ERK kinase
signaling cascades, have been well characterized and are known to
have prominent roles in cell survival and cell proliferation,
respectively. By blocking each of these pathways with specific

inhibitors, we hoped to determine which pathway was driving the
increase of 15-PGDH expression. H1435 cells treated with EGF were
incubated with specific inhibitors that block EGFR, AKT, or ERK
signaling (Fig. 2B, top). In cells treated with the PI3K inhibitor
LY294002, the 15-PGDH protein level was similar to control,
indicating that this pathway did not take part in the up-regulation
of 15-PGDH. On the other hand, the small molecule inhibitor
U0126, which blocks ERK activity by inhibiting the upstream MEK
kinase, clearly caused an increase in the level of 15-PGDH protein
similar to that seen with erlotinib. The treatment of A549 cells with
the same inhibitors did not produce any changes in the levels of

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (12). June 15, 2007

15-PGDH (Fig. 2B, bottom). These data indicate that the decrease in
the 15-PGDH protein expression level is associated with activation
of the Ras/MEK/ERK kinase pathway.
The induction of 15-PGDH protein expression by erlotinib
treatment should result in the reduction of PGE2. However, despite
the fact that 15-PGDH levels remain unchanged in A549 cells upon
erlotinib treatment, both the H1435 and the A549 cell lines showed
a reduction in the amount of PGE2 in the culture medium (Fig. 2C).
Because EGF stimulation has been shown to result in the induction
of the COX-2 promoter (12), we examined the COX-2 protein levels
in each cell line. For the A549 cells, COX-2 protein levels seem to

decrease f4-fold. Thus, the lowered PGE2 levels would seem to be
solely due to decreased COX-2 levels (Fig. 2D), as 15-PGDH levels
do not change. However, H1435 cells, which show a slight reduction
in COX-2 protein levels (about 2-fold; Fig. 2D), have a greater
overall reduction in PGE2 in the medium (Fig. 2C). This difference
is most likely due to the induction of 15-PGDH in the H1435 cells.
Although the use of the inhibitors clearly identified the ERK
signaling pathway as a regulator of 15-PGDH protein levels, the
molecular mechanism behind the down-regulation of 15-PGDH
remained to be determined. Recently, it had been shown in a colon
carcinoma cell line that ERK activation increased the intracellular
protein levels of the transcriptional repressor Slug, which then
down-regulated E-cadherin (13). E-cadherin protein levels were
restored, and Slug protein levels reduced by treatment with the
MEK inhibitors PD98059 and U0126. To test the possibility that
this mechanism was operating in the H1435 cell line, we examined
E-cadherin protein expression (Fig. 3A, top). We found that both
erlotinib and U0126 treatment increased the levels of E-cadherin in
the H1435 cells, providing strong evidence that transcriptional
repression was occurring through EGF stimulation of the MEK/
ERK signaling pathway. This was not the case for A549 cells where
E-cadherin protein levels remained unchanged with the addition
of these inhibitors (Fig. 3A, bottom). Examination of the 15-PGDH
promoter revealed several E-boxes, which are sites bound by the
Snail, Slug, and ZEB1 transcriptional repressors (14, 15). Indeed,
the loss of PGDH expression in colon cancer is most likely due to
the up-regulation and binding of the transcriptional repressor
Snail to E-boxes located in the PGDH promoter (5). Quantitative
RT-PCR analysis of H1435 and A549 cell lines revealed a reduction
in ZEB1 and Slug transcripts following erlotinib and U0126
treatment in H1435 but not A549 cells (Fig. 3B and C). This
strongly suggests that ZEB1 and Slug are downstream targets of
the EGFR through activated ERK, and that one or both of these
transcriptional repressors controls the expression of 15-PGDH in
the H1435 cell line. We also examined the levels of Snail
transcripts in H1435 and A549 cells and found that Snail
transcripts were slightly, but significantly, decreased in both cell
lines with erlotinib but not following U0126 treatment (Supplementary Fig. S2). The fold reduction in transcript levels was small
when compared with ZEB1 and Slug, and the Snail transcript
levels were not reduced significantly with U0126 treatment,
suggesting that this repressor is not responsible for the repression
of 15-PGDH in these cell lines.
Transcriptional repressors, such as ZEB1 and Slug, are known to
repress transcription by recruiting histone deacetylases (HDAC) to

Electrophoretic mobility shift assay shows that FL-SLUG retards the migration of PGDHpr3. B, Western blot of nuclear lysates used in the electrophoretic mobility

oligonucleotide is shifted when FL-Slug is added to the binding reaction. Cold PGDHpr3 in 50-fold molar excess competes with the labeled probe, whereas an
unlabeled nonspecific competitor (PGDHpr2) in 50-fold molar excess does not compete despite the presence of the E-box, CAGCTG. An anti-FLAG monoclonal
antibody (2 Ag) added to the reaction disrupts FL-Slug binding to PGDHpr3. The same amount of a nonspecific monoclonal antibody, anti-hemagglutinin (HA ), has
no effect. D, the region in (A ) was subcloned into the pGL3-basic luciferase reporter construct. This reporter construct was cotransfected with TK-pRL (Renilla

promoters through an interaction with COOH-terminal binding
protein (14, 15). Additional proof of the involvement of the
transcriptional repressors ZEB1 and Slug in the regulation of
15-PGDH is provided by the use of a HDAC inhibitor (Fig. 3D).
Addition of nanomolar amounts of TSA to H1435 and A549 cells
significantly increases the protein levels of PGDH in these cell lines.
Recently, similar results were observed by Tong et al. (16) using

various HDAC inhibitors. Interestingly, they showed that HDAC
inhibitors induced luciferase activity from a reporter construct
containing the same 15-PGDH promoter region as Mann et al.
Our data suggest that ZEB1 and Slug are regulating the 15-PGDH
promoter, but definitive proof would require that we show binding
of these transcription factors to the promoter. To show that these
transcriptional repressors bind to the 15-PGDH promoter, we

synthesized three oligonucleotides for gel shift analysis that
encompassed each of the three E-boxes located in the 15-PGDH
5¶ flanking region (Fig. 4A). Nuclear lysates isolated from cells
transfected with either vector or FLAG-tagged ZEB1 (FL-ZEB) or
FLAG-tagged Slug (FL-Slug; Fig. 4B) were incubated with the
labeled oligonucleotides. Surprisingly, only FL-Slug bound to one of
the three oligonucleotides that encompassed an E-box just
upstream of the putative TATA box and transcriptional start site
(Fig. 4A). This E-box sequence, CAGGTG, present in the PGDHpr3
oligonucleotide is reported to be a perfect consensus-binding site
for the Slug repressor (17). Figure 4C provides further proof that
the complex formed in the gel shift contains Slug. A nonspecific
oligo containing an E-box that is not the perfect Slug consensus
(CAGCTG) does not compete with PGDHpr3 for binding. In
addition, an anti-FLAG antibody, but not an anti-HA antibody,
almost completely blocks complex formation and shifts the
complex, providing further proof that Slug is binding this
oligonucleotide derived from the PGDH promoter. The observation
that only Slug, and not ZEB1, binds to the 15-PGDH promoter and
regulates its activity is further bolstered by transcription assays
using the first 626 bp of the 15-PGDH promoter (Fig. 4A). Slug
clearly represses transcription by up to 10-fold in a dose-dependent
manner. ZEB1 does not repress the 15-PGDH promoter at the
lowest levels of plasmid and shows only weak and probably
nonspecific inhibition with the highest amounts of FL-ZEB
expression construct (Fig. 4D). These experiments were repeated
with a human ZEB1 (hZEB1) containing expression construct with
the same results (data not shown). Based on these observations, we
suggest that Slug plays a key role in the repression of 15-PGDH in a
subset of NSCLC.
The altered regulation of genes through the up-regulation of
zinc-finger transcriptional repressors, such as ZEB1, Slug, and
Snail, is being increasingly recognized as an important mechanism in cancer progression. We present evidence that the loss of
15-PGDH and the resulting increased PGE2 level in a subset of
NSCLC are most likely due to an increase in the amount of the
Slug transcriptional repressor. Alternatively, the down-regulation

of PGDH in colorectal cancer is probably due to the presence of
higher levels of Snail (5). Several studies have shown that upregulation of ZEB1 is responsible for a more mesenchymal state
and is correlated with gefitinib resistance in NSCLC cell lines
(18, 19). Resistant cell lines could be made more sensitive to
gefitinib by pretreatment with an HDAC inhibitor. Investigation
into the transcriptional regulation of Snail provides evidence that
an activated MEK/ERK pathway is involved in its up-regulation
(20). Our study and that of Mann et al. would indicate that Slug,
ZEB1, and Snail are regulated by activated EGFR through the
MEK/ERK pathway. Interestingly, two of the cell lines that did
not show up-regulation of 15-PGDH upon erlotinib treatment
(i.e., A549 and H2122) both have mutated K-Ras, whereas the
responsive cell lines (i.e., H1435 and H1648) have wild-type K-Ras.
This may be relevant as Slug seems to be regulated through the
MEK/ERK pathway (21). It is in cell lines, and perhaps solid
tumors, with wild-type K-Ras that erlotinib can down-regulate
transcriptional repressors and up-regulate tumor suppressors
such as 15-PGDH. The restoration of 15-PGDH protein levels and
decrease in COX-2 levels through erlotinib treatment in a subset
of NSCLC could provide one explanation for the survival benefit
of erlotinib, particularly in those patients without an activating
EGFR mutation. Understanding how these transcriptional
repressors are regulated will be an important area for future
research and will hopefully provide opportunities for more
effective cancer treatments.
