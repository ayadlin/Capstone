ABSTRACT
There is an unmet clinical need for molecularly directed therapies available for
metastatic colorectal cancer. Comprehensive genomic profiling has the potential to
identify actionable genomic alterations in colorectal cancer. Through comprehensive
genomic profiling we prospectively identified 6 RET fusion kinases, including two
novel fusions of CCDC6-RET and NCOA4-RET, in metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC)
patients. RET fusion kinases represent a novel class of oncogenic driver in CRC and
occurred at a 0.2% frequency without concurrent driver mutations, including KRAS,
NRAS, BRAF, PIK3CA or other fusion tyrosine kinases. Multiple RET kinase inhibitors
were cytotoxic to RET fusion kinase positive cancer cells and not RET fusion kinase
negative CRC cells. The presence of a RET fusion kinase may identify a subset of
metastatic CRC patients with a high response rate to RET kinase inhibition. This is the
first characterization of RET fusions in CRC patients and highlights the therapeutic
significance of prospective comprehensive genomic profiling in advanced CRC.

INTRODUCTION

paradigm is best demonstrated in tumors that are driven
by activated protein tyrosine kinases due to oncogenic
mutations or rearranged chromosomal fusion [3]. Classic
examples include gefitinib inhibition of EGFR mutant
kinase in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and
imatinib inhibition of BCR-ABL fusion kinase in chronic
myeloid leukemia [4, 5].
Oncogenic RET point mutations and rearranged
RET fusions induce hereditary and sporadic tumors [6] .
RET fusion kinase occurs in nearly one-third of papillary
thyroid cancer and ~ 2% of lung adenocarcinoma,
but is not yet identified in CRC [6]. RET fusion kinase
juxtaposes the C-terminal RET kinase domain to an
N-terminal coiled-coil or leucine zipper dimerization
domain from multiple 5’ fusion partners to trigger ligand

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second most
common cause of cancer-related death in the United States.
Currently, metastatic CRC patients are treated mainly as
an unselected cohort with angiogenesis inhibitors and
cytotoxic chemotherapy. Only the absence of an oncogenic
KRAS or NRAS mutation has been found to predict clinical
benefit from treatment with anti-EGFR antibodies [1].
Although recent molecular characterization of CRC has
not yet been translated into effective therapeutic strategies
[2], comprehensive genomic profiling has emerged as
a promising approach that enables the identification of
genomic biomarkers that may inform the use of targeted
therapy in clinical trials. This therapeutic genomic

prospective comprehensive genomic profiling using next
generation sequencing (NGS) on metastatic colorectal
tumors in the complete coding sequence of 236 cancerrelated genes and the introns of 19 frequently rearranged
cancer-related genes (Supplemental Table 1). Prior
retrospective analyses with NGS of 40 CRC specimens
detected a C2orf44-ALK fusion kinase but did not identify
any RET fusion kinase [8]. As expected, we detected
mutations in KRAS, PIK3CA, BRAF, p53 and APC, which
are known mutated oncogenes and tumor suppressors in
CRC (data not shown). We prospectively profiled 3,117
metastatic colorectal tumors, and identified the presence of
6 RET fusion kinases to give a frequency of 0.2% (Figure
1A). The clinicopathologic characteristics of these six
RET fusion-positive CRC patients revealed the absence
of a concurrent driver mutation or other fusion tyrosine
kinases (Figure 1B). We identified two novel RET fusion

4 (NCOA4) in two patients with metastatic CRC. Patient
1 had a CCDC6-RET fusion kinase with amino-terminal
CCDC6 exon 1-2 and carboxyl-terminal RET exon 11-19
(Figure 1C). The CCDC6-RET fusion kinase in patient 1
occurred at a novel breakpoint at CCDC6 intron 2 and RET
intron 10 from a chromosome 10 inversion event, which
differs from the CCDC6-RET fusion kinase breakpoints
in thyroid cancer and lung cancer that fused CCDC6 exon

1 to RET exon 12-20 [9]. Patient 2 had an NCOA4-RET
fusion kinase with amino-terminal NCOA4 exons 1-9 and
carboxyl-terminal RET exons 12-19, with breakpoints at
NCOA4 intron 9 and RET intron 11 from a chromosome
10 tandem duplication event (Figure 1D). The NCOA4α
isoform observed in patient 2 was nearly full length in
comparison to the truncated NCOA4β isoform fused to
RET exon 12 in papillary thyroid carcinoma and NSCLC
adenocarcinoma [10, 11].

negative CRC cells remained resistant even at micomolar
concentration (Figure 2B). Vandetanib and lenvatinib,
which are FDA-approved RET kinase inhibitors with
clinical efficacy against RET fusion-positive thyroid
cancer [14, 15], followed the same pattern and specifically
inhibited only Lc2/ad cells viability (Figure 2C and 2D).
In contrast, both KRAS wildtype Lc2/ad and SW48
cells had increased sensitivity to erlotinib treatment, and
KRAS mutant CRC cells were resistant to this EGFR
kinase inhibitor as predicted (Figure 2E) [16]. RET kinase
inhibitors specifically suppressed only RET fusion-positive
cancer cells viability and did not show non-specific
suppression of RET fusion-negative CRC cells viability
with either KRAS wildtype or mutant status.

Because regorafenib inhibits the proliferation of
thyroid TT cells driven by oncogenic RETC634W point
mutation [12], we next tested the ability of regorafenib
to inhibit RET fusion-positive cancer cells. Using two
different primer pairs that either bound within the RET
kinase domain or flanked the CCDC6-RET fusion site, we
confirmed by quantitative PCR that Lc2/ad cancer cells,
but not several KRAS wildtype and mutant CRC cells,
harbored the CCDC6-RET fusion kinase (Figure 2A) [13].
Treatment with nanomolar concentration of regorafenib
was cytotoxic to Lc2/ad cells, but the RET fusion-

patient to regorafinib

and wished to minimize therapy related toxicity. She was
treated with low-dose regorafenib 80 mg daily for 3 days
and continued at 40 mg daily. Clinically, patient 1 had
resolution of her early satiety and abdominal discomfort
within 1 week of regorafenib initiation. She had a rapid
CEA response from 471 to 158 and LDH response from
3310 to 1651 after 18 days of treatment (Figures 3B3C). No further follow-up was available as the patient
succumbed to urosepsis shortly thereafter. Her clinical and
CEA tumor marker responses suggested regorafenib has
single agent activity in RET fusion positive CRC.

The absence of a concurrent driver mutation in
RET fusion-positive CRC patients suggest that they
may respond to a RET kinase inhibitor. Patient 1 was a
63-year-old woman who was diagnosed with stage IV
sigmoid colon adenocarcinoma, and the PET/CT and MRI
scans showed widespread metastases most notable for an
enlarged liver that was nearly replaced by tumor (Figure
3A). Patient 1 declined chemotherapy-based treatment

kinase targets such as PDGFR or VEGFR, and RET fusion
status analysis of the 1% regorafenib responders is needed.
Since these RET fusion-positive CRC patients received a
high median dose of regorafenib 147 mg daily, additional
potential off-target effects likely contributed to the 54%
incidence rate of severe or life-threatening adverse events
[24]. Notably, RET fusion-positive cancer cells, but not
RET fusion-negative cancer cells, had similar exquisite
sensitivity to regorafenib, vandetanib and lenvatinib,
which share RET and VEGFR kinases as the only common
molecular targets. In light of the poor single agent activity
of angiogenesis inhibitor in CRC patients, our findings
suggest that the presence of RET fusion kinase identifies
a subset of CRC patients with exceptional response to
RET kinase inhibition. Further work and larger series are
required to confirm and expand upon our findings.
Treatment of metastatic CRC patients with
regorafenib at the maximum tolerated dose as used in the
CORRECT trial has significant toxicity, and low-dose
regorafenib may be of sufficient potency to inhibit tumors
driven by RET fusion kinase [24]. To minimize therapy
related toxicity and improve anti-RET kinase response, it
is worthwhile to evaluate the therapeutic index of currently
available anti-RET tyrosine kinase inhibitors in the subset
of CRC patients who express RET fusion kinase. Although
there may be a tissue-specific or contextual contribution
to response, our findings are similar to reported responses
to RET-directed therapies in thyroid cancer and NSCLC.
Currently, several tyrosine kinase inhibitors with antiRET kinase activity such as vandetanib, lenvatinib,
ponatinib, and carbozantinib are at various stages of
clinical development for medullary thyroid carcinoma,
in which RET is the critical oncogenic driver, and lung
adenocarcinoma. Vandetanib, cabozantinib, and lenvatinib
are FDA-approved as treatment in advanced thyroid
cancer, since they significantly prolonged progressionfree survival when compared to placebo [14, 15, 25]. In
RET-fusion positive NSCLC patients who had progressed
on prior chemotherapy, treatment with the RET kinase
inhibitors, vandetanib or carbozantinib, results with partial
responses in three patients [26, 27]. We now extend the
clinical activity of RET fusion kinase inhibition to CRC
patients.
Our analysis of the COSMIC database summarizes
the frequency of oncogenic fusion kinases and point
mutations in CRC patients. However, the COSMIC
database most likely underestimates the frequency
of gene fusions and point mutations in CRC patients
since the entire coding sequence of each gene was not
determined. Using a comprehensive genomic profiling
approach, we prospectively identified 6 RET fusions in
CRC and an overall RET fusion frequency of 0.2%. The
identification of CRC patients with actionable RET fusion
kinase provides further evidence of the impact that NGS
has on clinical decision-making, and we anticipate the
rapid adoption of prospective genomic profiling as a part

Next, we analyzed the Catalogue of Somatic
Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC) database for cancerrelated gene fusions and point mutations in CRC patients.
In addition to the six RET fusion kinases we have
identified, there were other fusion kinases involving ALK,
NTRK and ROS and WNT pathway fusions involving
RSPO and TCF7L2 (Figure 4A) [8, 17-21]. Based on
the COSMIC database, genetic alterations by rearranged
fusions were less common than missense or nonsense
point mutations in those genes. RET point mutations
occurred in 5.7% of CRC patients, and 30 of the 84 RET
point mutations were localized within the RET kinase
domain (Figure 4A). Notably, 8 RET mutations occurred
specifically at E768, R844, S904, R912 and M918 (data
not shown), which corresponded to hereditary RET
mutated sites in familiar medullary thyroid carcinoma and
multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2B [6, 22].

DISCUSSION
Using comprehensive genomic profiling we have
identified six RET fusion kinases in CRC and provide
early clinicopathologic characteristics of this patient
subset. The RET fusion kinase appears to be a mutually
exclusive oncogenic driver that does not overlap with
other known driver mutations such as KRAS, BRAF,
EGFR and PIK3CA and oncogenic fusion kinases
involving ALK, ROS1 and NTRK. Since we observed a
low 0.2% frequency in unselected CRC patients, this
mutual exclusivity may facilitate prospective screening for
RET fusion kinase in CRC patients who are pan-negative
for other known driver mutations. Further, the breakpoint
locations observed on two of our patients appear to
be novel. Our clinicopathologic observation that RET
fusion kinase occurs in younger never smoker patients
without other known driver alterations is consistent
with observations in fusion kinase driven NSCLC and
will require further validation in a larger cohort of CRC
patients [11, 23].
Our data suggest that CRC patients who harbor RET
fusion kinase without a concurrent driver mutation may
respond to regorafenib, a potent RET kinase inhibitor with
an IC50 of ~ 1.5n M [12]. The in-vitro studies suggest low
dose regorafenib potently suppresses RET fusion-positive
cancer cells but has minimal inhibitory activity in RET
fusion-negative CRC cells. Indeed, only 1% of unselected
metastatic CRC patients treated with regorafenib had
an objective or partial response in the CORRECT trial,
which demonstrated a 1.4 month overall survival benefit
compared to placebo [24]. We cannot preclude the
possibility that the clinical activity of regorafenib in the
CORRECT trial may be due to its inhibition of other

transcribed with SuperScript Reverse Transcriptase II
(Invitrogen) to generate cDNA template. Quantitative
PCR was performed on the Roche Lightcycler 480 II with
the addition of Taq polymerase, SYBR green (Roche Life
Science) and primer pairs (Fisher Scientific). RET- forward

Next-generation sequencing (NGS) assay covering
3,769 exons of 236 cancer-related genes and 47 introns of
19 genes frequently rearranged in cancer (Supplemental
Table 1) was performed by Foundation Medicine, Inc., a
CLIA-certified and CAP-accredited laboratory, based on
a modified published protocol.[8] Briefly, formalin-fixed,
paraffin-embedded (FFPE) specimen quality of volume
>1mm3, nucleated cellularity >80% or >30,000 cells,
and >20% tumor nuclei was ensured by macro-dissection
as needed and confirmed by a pathologist. DNA was
extracted using the Promega Maxwell 16 Tissue LEV
DNA kit and quantified using an Invitrogen Picogreen
fluorescence assay. Library Construction was performed
with 50-200 ng of DNA sheared by sonication (Covaris
E210) to ~100-400 bp before end-repair, dA addition,
ligation of indexed Illumina sequencing adaptors and
PCR amplification for 10 cycles using Kapa HiFi. Solution
phase hybridization was performed with a custom baitset
of 120-bp biotinylated DNA oligonucleotides (Integrated
DNA Technology), and 49 x 49 paired-end sequencing
was performed using the Illumina HiSeq 2000 and
Illumina HiSeq 2500 platforms. Sequence alignment, PCR
duplicate read removal, and local alignment optimization
was performed using BWA aligner 0.5.9, Picard 1.47
(http://picard.sourceforge.net/), Samtools 0.1.12a, and
GATK 1.0.4705, and variant calling was performed
using custom tools. Base substitutions were called using
a Bayesian methodology, short indels were called using
local assembly, copy number alterations were called
through comparison to process-matched normal controls,
and rearrangements were called using chimeric read pairs
clustered by genomic position. Somatic variants were
annotated using COSMIC and germline variants were
removed using dbSNP.

Cell toxicity assay
A total of 8,000 cells/well were plated in 100µl of
culture media in 96-well plates and treated the next day
with 100µl of 0.1% DMSO media control or drugs at the
indicated concentrations. After 72 hours, AlamarBlue (Life
Technologies) was added, and cellular fluorescence was
quantified per manufacturer instruction with a BioTEK
Synergy 2 microplate reader.
