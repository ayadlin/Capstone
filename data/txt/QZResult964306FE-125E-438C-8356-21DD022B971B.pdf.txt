Abstract
Generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) has been
observed in cancer cells treated with paclitaxel, but the
underlying mechanisms and therapeutic implications remain
unclear. In the present study, we showed that paclitaxel
promoted ROS generation through enhancing the activity of
NADPH oxidase (NOX) associated with plasma membranes.
Treatment of breast cancer cells caused an increased
translocation of Rac1, a positive regulatory protein of NOX,
to the membrane fraction. The paclitaxel-induced ROS
generation occurred rapidly within several hours of drug
exposure, with O2 and H2O2 accumulation mainly outside the
cells while the intracellular ROS remained unchanged.
Importantly, the increase in extracellular ROS caused lethal
damage to the bystander cancer cells not exposed to
paclitaxel, as shown by two different methods using coculture
systems where the bystander cells were differentiated from the
paclitaxel-treated cells by fluorescent or radioactive labeling.
This cytotoxic bystander effect was also observed with other
microtubule-targeted agents vincristine and taxotere but not
with 5-fluorouracil or doxorubicin. This toxic bystander effect
was enhanced by CuZnSOD that converts O2 to H2O2 and was
abolished by a catalase that eliminates H2O2. Furthermore,
paclitaxel was able to induce an almost complete inhibition of
proliferation of the bystander cells in the coculture system.
Our study revealed a novel mechanism by which paclitaxel
induces toxic bystander effect through generation of extracellular H2O2 from the membrane-associated NOX. This may
contribute to the potent anticancer activity of paclitaxel and
provide a novel basis to improve the clinical use of this
important drug. [Cancer Res 2007;67(8):3512–17]

Introduction
Paclitaxel is a microtubule-targeted agent widely used in cancer
therapy. Its primary cellular effect is to cause abnormal
stabilization of the dynamic microtubule polymerization, leading
to the failure of mitosis. In addition, paclitaxel also alters other
cellular functions that involve microtubules, such as intracellular
signaling and organelle transport and locomotion (1). Recent
studies showed that paclitaxel is able to induce early reactive
oxygen species (ROS) production in cancer cells, and hydrogen
peroxide (H2O2) was found to be involved in paclitaxel-induced
cancer cell death in vitro and in vivo (2–4). However, the

mechanisms of paclitaxel-induced oxidative stress remain unknown. H2O2 mainly comes from the dismutation of superoxide
(O2 ), a reaction catalyzed by superoxide dismutases (SOD). Most
cellular O2 is produced by mitochondrial respiratory chain as a
product of aerobic metabolism (5). Another significant source of
O2 is NADPH oxidases (NOX), which are mainly associated with
plasma membrane and produce O2 outside the cells (6). NOX
activity is regulated by the assembling of active enzyme complex
from catalytic subunits gp91phox, p22phox, and Rac1 and other
components. The translocation of Rac1 from cytosol to the plasma
membrane seems to be a crucial step in NOX activation and O2
production (7). The objectives of the present study were to
determine the source or subcellular location of the ROS production
induced by paclitaxel and to evaluate the possible contribution of
ROS in mediating its cytotoxic effect.

Materials and Methods
Materials and cell culture. Dihydroethidine, N-acetyl-3,7-dihydroxyphenoxazine, and 5-chloromethylfluoroscein diacetate (CMFDA) were
purchased from Molecular Probe (Eugene, OR), and 3H-thymidine was
purchased from Amersham (Piscataway, NJ). Mouse anti-Rac1, mouse antih-actin, and rabbit anti-p22phox antibodies were from BD Biosciences (San
Diego, CA), Sigma (St. Louis, MO), and Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa
Cruz, CA), respectively. Human breast cancer cell line MCF7 was cultured in
a 1:1 mix of DMEM and F12 medium. Human lung cancer cell line H1299,
human leukemia cell line HL-60, and the mitochondrial respiratorydefective HL60/C6F clone were cultured in RPMI 1640. All media were
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). The HL60/C6F cell
culture medium was also supplemented with 1 mmol/L sodium pyruvate,
50 Amol/L uridine, and an additional 2.7% glucose.
Assays of ROS production. Intracellular O2 was measured by flow
cytometry using dihydroethidine as described (5). SOD-inhibitable reduction of cytochrome c was used to detect extracellular O2 release as
previously described (8). Briefly, MCF7 cells in 96-well plates at 80%
confluence were incubated with 100 nmol/L paclitaxel for 1 h in Hank’s
buffer saline (HBS). Cytochrome c (110 Amol/L) and catalase (70 units/mL)
were then added, with or without 100 units/mL CuZnSOD. Absorbance was
measured at 550 nm after a 20-min incubation. The A 550 values were
converted to nanomoles of cytochrome c reduced, using a net extinction
coefficient of 2.1  104 (mol/L) 1 cm 1. O2 concentration was calculated
from the difference in the amounts of cytochrome c reduced in the absence
and presence of CuZnSOD. Extracellular H2O2 was determined by
fluorometry in 96-well plates using N-acetyl-3,7-dihydroxyphenoxazine as
a cell-impermeable probe as previously described (9). The cells were
incubated with 100 nmol/L paclitaxel, 50 Amol/L Amplex red, and
0.1 units/mL horseradish peroxidase in serum-free medium for 60 min at
37jC. Fluorescence was measured using excitation at 530 nm and detection
at 590 nm. Because this assay has a high fluorescent background, samples
containing the same medium and Amplex red reagents without cells were
run in parallel as blank control for subtraction of the nonspecific
fluorescent background from the test samples. The net values were then
used to calculate extracellular H2O2 concentrations using a H2O2 standard
curve determined under the same conditions.

Assay of NOX activity associated with cell membranes. Cells were
scraped and suspended in ice-cold buffer containing 20 mmol/L HEPES,
10 mmol/L KCl, 1.5 mmol/L MgCl2, 1 mmol/L EDTA, 1 mmol/L EGTA,
100 mmol/L sucrose, and a cocktail of protease inhibitors. The cell
suspension was homogenized with 15 strokes in a glass tissue homogenizer.
The samples were centrifuged at 800 g at 4jC for 5 min to remove unbroken
cells and nuclei. The supernatants were centrifuged again at 100,000  g for
30 min to separate the membrane fraction (pellet) and the cytosolic fraction
(supernatant) as described (10). Protein concentrations were determined
using a BCA Protein Assay kit (Pierce, Rockford, IL) with bovine serum
albumin as standard. Generation of O2 in the membrane fraction was
measured by lucigenin chemoluminescence in 100 AL of HBS containing
100 Amol/L NADPH, 50 Amol/L lucigenin, and 1.75 Ag of cell membrane
proteins (11). After a 5-min incubation at 37jC, chemiluminescence was
measured using a luminometer (Turner Designs, Sunnyvale, CA) for 1 min.
The signal was normalized and expressed as arbitrary light units per
microgram protein per minute.
Immunoblotting of membrane-associated proteins. Cell membrane
fractions were isolated as described above, and the associated proteins
(20 Ag) were resolved by electrophoresis on 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to
nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blotted for molecules of
interest with anti-Rac1 (1:2,000), anti-p22phox (1:500), and anti-actin (1:10,000)
antibodies overnight. The bound primary antibodies were detected using
proper horseradish peroxidase–conjugated secondary antibodies followed by
detection with a SuperSignal enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Pierce). For
sequential blotting, the membranes were stripped with a stripping buffer
(Pierce) followed by reblotting with proper antibodies.
Assessment of cytotoxic bystander effect using fluorescent probes.
For cell labeling, we used a fluorescent probe CMFDA, which passes cell
membranes freely. Once inside the cells, it is converted to cell-impermeable
green fluorescent product. After loading, cells remain fluorescent for several
days and proliferate for at least four cell divisions (12). MCF7 cells were first
incubated with 5 Amol/L CMFDA at 37jC for 30 min in serum-free medium,
which was then replaced by fresh medium (with 10% FBS without CMFDA)
for another 30 min before the cells were trypsinized for coculture with
unlabeled MCF7 cells pretreated with 100 nmol/L paclitaxel for 3 h in sixwell plates (50% confluence). Paclitaxel was removed by extensive washing
with fresh medium, and the CMFDA-labeled cells in fresh medium were
added to each well in the presence or absence of catalase or SOD as
indicated. As a negative control, CMFDA-labeled cells were cocultured with
untreated MCF7 cells. The ratio of CMFDA-labeled cells to unlabeled drugtreated cells was f1:3. After 48 h of coculture, cell death was assessed by
direct propidium iodide (PI) staining (1 Ag/mL PI in 1 mL PBS per well).
The dead cells with compromised membrane integrity became permeable
to PI, and their nuclei appeared either red (paclitaxel treated) or yellow
(CMFDA-labeled cells, indicative of bystander effect). Cell images were
captured using a Nikon fluorescent microscope (Eclipse TE300). To evaluate
the ROS effect on the growth of bystander cells, the number of CMFDAlabeled cells was directly counted in 24-well plate under fluorescent
microscope 4 h after plating (baseline cell number) and 48 h after coculture.
In each well, cells were counted in three separate areas of 0.4 mm2 per field.
Each condition was done in triplicate. Thus, the cell density was calculated
as the mean of nine separate measurements.
Measurement of toxic bystander effect by 3H-thymidine labeling.
MCF7 cells (5  104 per mL) were incubated with 2 ACi/mL 3H-thymidine
for 48 h, washed twice with PBS, and trypsinized for coculture with
unlabeled MCF7 cells (50% confluence) pretreated for 3 h with paclitaxel
(50–500 nmol/L), taxotere (100–500 nmol/L), vincristine (300 nmol/L),
5-fluorouracil (5-FU; 1 mmol/L), and doxorubicin (3 Amol/L) in a similar
fashion as described above. Nonadherent cells were removed after overnight
incubation. After a 96-h coculture, radioactivity in the culture medium
released from the bystander cells was measured using a scintillation
counter. The level of radioactivity in the medium was indicative of cell
death from the 3H-thymidine–labeled population (13).
Statistical analysis. Student’s t test was used to evaluate the statistical
differences of the experimental values between two samples to be
compared.

Results and Discussion
Paclitaxel induces NOX activation and extracellular release
of O2 and H2O2. We first examined the effect of paclitaxel on
intracellular ROS levels in MCF7 cells. As shown in Fig. 1A,
exposure of cells to a toxic concentration of paclitaxel (100 nmol/L)
for 8 h did not cause any increase in cellular O2 . In contrast,
paclitaxel caused a significant increase in extracellular O2 and H2O2
at 1 h (Fig. 1B). This H2O2 increase was detectable as early as
30 min (but not at 15 min) and continued to increase linearly up to
90 min. Addition of exogenous CuZnSOD further increased the
extracellular H2O2 by 45% in the paclitaxel-treated cells, suggesting
an increased conversion of O2 to H2O2 by the enzyme. SOD showed
no effect on extracellular H2O2 when cells were not exposed to
paclitaxel (data not shown). Because neither CuZnSOD nor O2 is
able to pass cellular membranes, these data suggest that O2
production in the paclitaxel-treated cells was directly released
outside the cells where it is subsequently dismutated into H2O2.
The ability of paclitaxel to induce elevation of extracellular
H2O2 was also observed in a different human cell line HL-60
(Fig. 1C). Interestingly, using a subclone of HL-60 (C6F cells)
completely defective in mitochondrial respiration (5), we showed
that although the overall ROS generation was low due to
respiration defect, paclitaxel caused a similar fold of increase in
extracellular H2O2 in this cell culture (Fig. 1C). These data
suggest that mitochondrial respiratory chain was not a
significant source of paclitaxel-induced ROS generation, and that
membrane-associated NOX would be the likely site of ROS
production. These observations prompted us to further measure
the activity of NOX in membrane fractions of MCF7 cells
incubated with or without paclitaxel. As shown in Fig. 1D,
exposure of MCF7 cells to 100 nmol/L paclitaxel induced a 2-fold
increased in NOX activity, as evidenced by an in vitro
luminescence assay. Similar results were obtained with human
lung cancer H1299 cells (data not shown). Immunobloting
showed that paclitaxel induced an increase in Rac1 protein
(a positive regulator of NOX enzyme complex) in the membrane
fraction of MCF7 cells (Fig. 1D), consistent with the activation of
membrane-associated NOX.
Paclitaxel causes cytotoxic bystander effect mediated by
H2O2. We speculated that the extracellular accumulation of ROS
induced by paclitaxel might be toxic to bystander cells. To test
this possibility, we first treated MCF7 cells with 100 nmol/L
paclitaxel for 3 h and removed the drug by washing with fresh
medium. A separate dish of MCF7 cells was prelabeled with a
nontoxic green dye CMFDA (without paclitaxel) and then
trypsinized for coculture with the washed MCF7 cells pretreated
with paclitaxel (Fig. 2A). Adherent dead cells with compromised
membrane integrity were revealed by directly staining with PI
(red) in the culture dish. As shown in Fig. 2B, dead cells from the
paclitaxel-treated population exhibited red fluorescent nuclear
staining, whereas dead cells from the CMFDA-labeled bystander
cells showed yellow nuclear staining due to colabeling with green
(CMFDA) and red (PI) dyes. Quantitation of multiple samples
showed that among the CMFDA-labeled bystander cells, the mean
percentage of PI-labeled cells increased over 10-fold from 0.3% in
the sample cocultured with control (untreated) cells to 3.6% in
the sample cocultured with paclitaxel-treated cells (Fig. 2C;
P < 0.01). It should be noted that this percentage probably
underestimated the true percentage of dead cells because only the
adherent cells were counted, and direct PI staining mainly
revealed dead cells in the late stage. Nevertheless, among all

PI-labeled cells (red + yellow), the percentage of yellow cells was
21 F 7%, suggesting that a significant portion of cell death was
due to the bystander effect.
To further investigate the role of ROS in mediating cytotoxic
bystander effect, the paclitaxel-treated cells and the CMFDAlabeled cells were cocultured in the presence or absence of catalase
or CuZnSOD in the culture medium. Catalase (2,000 units/mL), a
specific scavenger of H2O2, effectively prevented the cytotoxic
bystander effect, as evidenced by a significant decrease in
percentage of cells with yellow nuclear staining among the
CMFDA-labeled cells (Fig. 2C; P = 0.003). In contrast, addition of
CuZnSOD (100 units/mL) to the coculture did not prevent the
cytotoxic bystander effect. Instead, SOD caused a slight (but
statistically insignificant) increase in cell death among the
CMFDA-labeled bystander cells (Fig. 2C, compare column 4 with
column 5; P = 0.3). This slight increase likely reflected an increase
of H2O2 in the medium due to conversion of superoxide to H2O2
catalyzed by SOD. Neither catalase nor SOD caused any significant
change in the number of dead cells with red nuclear staining,
indicating that neither enzyme was able to alter the direct
cytotoxic effect of paclitaxel in MCF7 cells pretreated with the
drug.

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (8). April 15, 2007

The ability of exogenous catalase in the culture medium to
abolish the cytotoxic bystander effect strongly suggests that this
effect was mediated by H2O2 and was not due to the possible
presence of residual paclitaxel after washing.
Bystander cytotoxicity induced by microtubule-targeted
agents. A different coculture method was then used to confirm
the cytotoxic bystander effect of paclitaxel and to further evaluate
other anticancer agents with different mechanisms of action. In
this coculture system, the bystander cells were first labeled with
3
H-thymidine for two cell cycles (48 h) and washed free of
unincorporated 3H-thymidine before trypsinization for coculture
with MCF7 cells pretreated with paclitaxel, vincristine, 5-FU, or
doxorubicin. After 96 h of coculture, the radioactive DNA in the
medium released from dead cells as a consequence of toxic
bystander effect was quantified by liquid scintillation counting. As
shown in Fig. 3A, the bystander toxic effect of paclitaxel was again
observed, indicated by a significant increase of radioactivity
released from the bystander cells. Interestingly, the microtubule
destabilization agent vincristine also caused a substantial increase
(32%) of radioactivity released from the bystander cells. Using the
fluorescent double labeling coculture system described above,
300 nmol/L vincristine induced a significant increase of bystander

cells death with yellow nuclei (2.3 F 0.6% in treated sample
compared with 0.7 F 0.1% in control, P = 0.02). We also tested
various concentrations of paclitaxel (50–500 nmol/L) and taxotere
(100–500 nmol/L) for the bystander cell killing activity and showed
significant bystander effect in most concentrations tested (Fig. 3B).
In contrast, a highly toxic concentration of 5-FU (1 mmol/L) or
doxorubicin (3 Amol/L) did not cause cell death in the bystander
cells detected by the radioactive assay (Fig. 3A), or by using CMFDA
and PI double staining method (data not shown).

or 1 mmol/L 5-FU for 3 h as described in Materials and Methods. After 96 h, the
level of radioactivity released in the culture medium was measured. Radioactivity

Paclitaxel induces potent inhibition of bystander cell
proliferation. Based on the observation that H2O2 released from
the paclitaxel-treated cells was able to cause lethal damage to the
bystander cells, we reasoned that it is possible that in addition to
their severe toxic effect, the released ROS might also affect the
proliferative capacity of the bystander cells. To test this
possibility, the bystander cells were first labeled with CMFDA
(green) and then cocultured with unlabeled MCF7 cells pretreated with or without paclitaxel in a similar fashion as
described above. The density of the green cells (number of cells
per mm2) was then monitored over a 48-h period to evaluate
their growing rate. As shown in Fig. 4A, the density of the green
cells increased significantly 48 h after coculture with the control
MCF7 cells, indicating that the CMFDA-labeled cells were viable
and capable of proliferation, consistent with previous observation
(12). Quantitation of multiple samples from separate culture wells

Figure 4. Antiproliferative bystander effect of paclitaxel. MCF7 cells labeled with
CMFDA were cocultured with unlabeled MCF7 cells preincubated with or without

cell density was evaluated 4 h after platting and 48 h after coculture, as described
in Materials and Methods. A, representative photos of labeled cells cocultured

showed that the green cell density increased from 317 F 26 to
598 F 42 cells per mm2 at 48 h after seeding to the coculture
dish containing control (untreated) MCF7 cells (Fig. 4B).
Importantly, when the green cells were coculture with MCF7
cells pretreated with 100 nmol/L paclitaxel for 3 h (drug was
removed by washing with fresh medium before coculture), the
proliferation of these bystander cells was almost completely
inhibited (Fig. 4A and B). Similar results were obtained using the
human lung cancer H1299 cells (data not shown). Thus,
paclitaxel was able to induce a potent inhibition on proliferation
of the bystander cells. These results were consistent with
previous observations that exposure of cancer cells to H2O2
suppresses cell proliferation and induces cell death, even at
micromolar concentration (14).
Several anticancer agents, such as arsenic trioxide, doxorubicin,
bleomycin, cisplatin, 5-FU, and paclitaxel, have been shown to
induce ROS generation in cancer cells (15, 16). Various
mechanisms have been described, including respiratory chain
disruption, redox cycling, or p53-mediated mitochondrial oxidase
activation (5, 15, 16). To date, the mechanism responsible for ROS
induction by paclitaxel remains elusive. Our study showed that at
a clinically relevant concentration, paclitaxel is able to activate

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (8). April 15, 2007

the membrane-associated NOX, leading to extracellular release of
O2 , which is subsequently converted to H2O2 (spontaneous and/
or SOD catalyzed). Plasma membrane–associated NOX is the
main source of extracellular O2 and also seems to be the main
source of ROS production induced by paclitaxel. The ability of
paclitaxel to cause ROS generation in the mitochondrial respirationdefective cells (HL-60/C6F clone) suggests that mitochondria
respiratory chain is not the site where paclitaxel induces ROS
production. The observation that paclitaxel treatment was followed
by an increased translocation of Rac1 to the membrane fraction, a
crucial step in active NOX assembling (7), further suggests that
activation of NOX may be a key mechanism of action. This result is
in line with previous report showing that microtubules play a key
role in Rac1 transport, and that the polymerization state of
microtubules affects the Rac1 location to the membranes (17). It is
possible that the disturbance of microtubule polymerization by
paclitaxel, taxotere, or vincristine render Rac1 stabilized in the
active NOX complex, leading to increased ROS generation.
Interestingly, we observed that higher concentrations of paclitaxel
did not proportionally cause further increase in ROS generation
(data not shown), suggesting that the drug-induced disturbance of
microtubule polymerization state enhanced ROS production due to
stabilization of active NOX, which could not be further activated by
higher drug concentrations. This may also explain why the elevated
bystander cell killing effect was not linearly concentration
dependent (Fig. 3B).
Although the bystander effect of ionizing radiation has been
well described (18), there are few reports of such effect with
chemotherapy agent. By using two different methods, we showed
that paclitaxel displayed cytotoxic bystander effect in neighboring
cancer cells. By comparing the number of dead cells with yellow
or red nuclear staining, we estimated that about 20% of cell death
occurred in the bystander cells. Because the ratio of paclitaxeltreated cells and bystander cells in the coculture was 3:1 (25%
bystander cells), it seemed that paclitaxel killed nearly the same
proportion of cells in the population directly exposed to the drug
and in those submitted to bystander effect under our experimental conditions. In addition, paclitaxel was able to almost
completely inhibit the proliferation of the bystander cells. Taken
together, these data suggested that the bystander effects, both
lethal damage and inhibition of proliferation, may play a
significant role in the antitumor activity of paclitaxel. It is worth
noting that paclitaxel, like most anticancer drugs, has limited
ability to reach tumor cells that are distant from blood vessels
(19). Because H2O2 can diffuse relatively far from its production
origin, it may act on cells that are not reached by paclitaxel. It was
recently reported that SOD mimics that increase H2O2 production
are able to increase the antitumor activity of paclitaxel (4, 14). Our
findings that NOX activation by paclitaxel leads to bystander
effects against cancer cells open new perspectives to improve the
therapeutic activity of paclitaxel and potentially other microtubule-targeted agents.
