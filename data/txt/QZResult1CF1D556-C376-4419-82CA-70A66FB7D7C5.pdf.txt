Abstract

HHMI Author Manuscript

Chromosomal rearrangements play a central role in the pathogenesis of human cancers and often
result in the expression of therapeutically actionable gene fusions1. A recently discovered example
is a fusion between the Echinoderm Microtubule-associated Protein-like 4 (EML4) and the
Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase (ALK) genes, generated by an inversion on the short arm of
chromosome 2: inv(2)(p21p23). The EML4-ALK oncogene is detected in a subset of human nonsmall cell lung cancers (NSCLC)2 and is clinically relevant because it confers sensitivity to ALK
inhibitors3. Despite their importance, modeling such genetic events in mice has proven
challenging and requires complex manipulation of the germline. Here we describe an efficient
method to induce specific chromosomal rearrangements in vivo using viral-mediated delivery of
the CRISPR/Cas9 system to somatic cells of adult animals. We apply it to generate a mouse model
of Eml4-Alk-driven lung cancer. The resulting tumors invariably harbor the Eml4-Alkinversion,
express the Eml4-Alk fusion gene, display histo-pathologic and molecular features typical of ALK
+ human NSCLCs, and respond to treatment with ALK-inhibitors. The general strategy described
here substantially expands our ability to model human cancers in mice and potentially in other
organisms.

Genetically engineered mouse models of human cancers have proven indispensable to
dissect the molecular mechanisms underlying tumorigenesis4 and provide powerful
preclinical platforms for studying drug sensitivity5 and resistance6-8. Although many gainand loss-of-function mutations observed in human cancers can be modeled using current
gene-targeting technologies, chromosomal rearrangements leading to oncogenic gene
fusions have proven challenging to faithfully recapitulate in mice. Ectopic expression of
fusion oncoproteins from transgenes is widely used to study their oncogenic properties9-13,
though with this approach the fusion protein is invariably expressed at non-physiologic
levels and neither the role of reduced dosage of the wild type alleles nor the contribution of
the reciprocal product of the translocation can be examined. Strategies that express the
fusion transcript from the endogenous locus of the 5’ element14 only partially address these
limitations, whereas approaches that engineer loxP sites at each breakpoint and produce
rearrangements in the presence of Cre recombinase15,16 are laborious and have limited
applications. Novel genome-editing technologies provide a potentially more flexible strategy
to produce precise genomic changes including oncogenic chromosomal rearrangements17-20,
but they have not yet been adapted to model such rearrangements in vivo.

HHMI Author Manuscript

In the mouse genome, Eml4 and Alk are located on chromosome 17, approximately 11 Mbp
apart, in a region that is syntenic to human chromosome 2(p21-p23) (Fig. 1a). We attempted
to model the most common EML4-ALK variant in human NSCLCs21 by introducing
concomitant double-strand DNA breaks at intron 14 of Eml4 (which corresponds to intron
13 of EML4) and at intron 19 of Alk (Fig. 1a, 1b, Extended Data Fig. 1). To induce the
DNA breaks we chose the CRISPR system22 because it only requires co-expression of Cas9
and an appropriately designed RNA molecule (sgRNA)23.

HHMI Author Manuscript

We cloned sgRNAs targeting the Eml4 and Alk sites into the Cas9-expressing plasmid
pX33024 and co-transfected the resulting constructs in NIH/3T3. PCR analysis demonstrated
the induction of the Eml4-Alk inversion and of a large deletion of the region between the two
cut sites in the transfected cell population (Fig. 1b). The presence of the desired Eml4-Alk
inversion was confirmed by sequencing the corresponding Eml4-Alk fusion transcript (Fig.
1c) and directly visualized by interphase FISH (Fig. 1d, 1e). Using a similar strategy, we
also modeled the Npm1-Alk rearrangement, a reciprocal chromosomal translocation
commonly observed in anaplastic large cell lymphomas25 (Extended Data Fig. 2). These
results confirm that the CRISPR system can be adapted to engineer large deletions,
inversions, and chromosomal translocations in eukaryotic cells.
While appropriate for cell-based experiments, expression of two sgRNAs from separate
constructs would be impractical in vivo. We therefore engineered plasmids to
simultaneously express Cas9 and two distinct sgRNAs from tandem U6 promoters
(Extended Data Fig. 3a). Their transfection in NIH/3T3 cells resulted in comparable levels
of the two sgRNAs, efficient cleavage the targeted sites, and accumulation of the Eml4-Alk
inversion (Extended Data Fig. 3b, 3c, 3d).
To deliver Cas9 and sgRNAs targeting the Alk and Eml4 loci to the lungs of adult mice, we
next transferred the dual sgRNA/Cas9 cassette into an adenoviral shuttle vector (Extended

Data Fig. 4a) and produced recombinant adenoviruses (hereafter referred to as “Ad-EA”).
Adenoviral vectors are ideal because they efficiently infect the lung epithelium of adult
mice26 and do not integrate into the host genome. Infection of mouse embryo fibroblasts
(MEFs) with Ad-EA led to the expression of Cas9 and both sgRNAs, and to the rapid
generation of the desired Eml4-Alk inversion (Extended Data Fig. 4b, 4c, 4d). We
estimated that the Eml4-Alk inversion was produced in approximately 3-4% of infected
MEFs (Extended Data Fig. 4e, 4f).
To induce the Eml4-Alk rearrangement in vivo we next infected a cohort of adult CD1 and
C57BL/6J (B6) mice by intratracheal instillation of Ad-EA (n=52; 22 B6, 30 CD1) or
control adenoviruses expressing either the Cre recombinase (Ad-Cre, n=15; 6 B6, 9 CD1) or
Cas9 alone (Ad-Cas9, Fig. 2a, 2b, 2c, n=19; 9 B6, 10 CD1). An annotated list of all infected
animals is provided in Extended Data Table 1.

HHMI Author Manuscript

At two days and at one week post-infection the lungs appeared histologically normal with no
obvious signs of cytoxicity except for the presence of occasional inflammatory infiltrates
(Fig. 2a and data not shown). However, one month after Ad-EA infection, the lungs of mice
of both strains presented multiple small lesions that upon histopathological examination
appeared to be papillary intrabronchiolar epithelial hyperplasia, atypical adenomatous
hyperplasia (AAH), or early well-differentiated adenocarcinomas. By 6-8 weeks postinfection, larger tumors were easily detectable by micro-computed tomography (μCT) and
macroscopically visible at necropsy (Fig. 2b). At 12-14 weeks post-infection, the lungs of
Ad-EA-infected mice invariably contained multiple large lesions histologically classified as
lung adenocarcinomas.

HHMI Author Manuscript

In Ad-EA-infected animals, multiple bilateral lung tumors were frequently detected by 4-7
weeks post-infection (n=23/26 mice), and invariably after 8 weeks post-infection (n=34). In
contrast, Ad-Cre-infected mice remained tumor-free at all time points examined (n=14 mice,
range 4-18 weeks), with the exception of two CD1 mice in each of which we observed a
single small adenoma. Analogously, even at the latest time point examined (9 weeks postinfection), none of the Ad-Cas9 infected mice presented lung tumors (n=8 mice), while at
same time point all Ad-EA infected mice had developed multiple tumors (P-value < 0.0001,
Fisher's exact test). These results indicate that intra-trachel delivery of Ad-EA can initiate
lung tumorigenesis with high penetrance and low latency, and that this effect cannot be
attributed to adenoviral infection or Cas9 expression alone.
All tumors examined were positive for the pneumocyte marker Nkx-2.1/TTF1 and negative
for p63 and Sox2, in agreement with the diagnosis of lung adenocarcinoma (Fig. 2c). The
tumors were also strongly positive for the alveolar type II marker Surfactant Protein C
(SpC), whereas the Clara cell marker CCSP/CC10 was undetectable. The adenocarcinomas
had a papillary or, less frequently, acinar architecture (Fig. 2d, 2e). Most of these tumors
were in close proximity to bronchi and bronchioles showing papillary epithelial hyperplasia
(Fig. 2a, 2f), and areas of AAH were frequently observed, especially at earlier time points
(Fig. 2g). The majority of tumor cells appeared low-grade, with occasional instances of
intermediate nuclear atypia with enlarged nuclei and prominent nucleoli (Fig. 2h, 2h’).
Approximately 20% of tumors contained cells with a large cytoplasmic vacuole and a

peripherally located nucleus (Fig. 2i, 2i’). These cells are reminiscent of signet ring cells,
which are commonly observed in human ALK+ NSCLC27. Approximately 30% of
adenocarcinomas displayed areas of intense positivity at the periodic acid-Schiff (PAS)
staining (Fig. 2j. 2j’).
Interphase FISH analysis demonstrated the presence of a mono- or bi-allelic Eml4-Alk
inversion in every Ad-EA-induced tumor examined (n=4 animals) (Fig. 3a), but not in
control K-RasG12D-driven tumors28 (Fig. 3b). We further confirmed the presence of the
inversion and expression of the full-length Eml4-Alk transcript by PCR and RT-PCR
analysis of micro-dissected tumors followed by sequencing (Fig. 3c, 3d, 3e).
Activation of the human ALK oncogene via deregulation, translocation, or amplification has
been shown to lead to constitutive phosphorylation of ERK, STAT3, and AKT29. At 12-14
weeks post-infection, all lung tumors derived from Ad-EA-injected mice showed
phosphorylation and nuclear localization of Stat3. Phosphorylation of Akt and Erk1/2 were
also frequently, but not invariably, observed (Fig. 3f, 3g).

HHMI Author Manuscript

Finally, we examined the sensitivity of Ad-EA-induced lung tumors to crizotinib, a dual
ALK/MET inhibitor used in the clinic to treat patients affected by ALK+ NSCLCs3. Ten
Ad-EA infected CD1 mice were monitored by μCT scans starting at 9 weeks post-infection
until the appearance of multiple large lung tumors, at which point the animals were
randomly assigned to receive a daily dose of crizotinib (n=7) or vehicle (n=3) (Fig. 4a).
After two weeks of treatment the animals in the crizotinib group displayed complete (6/7) or
partial (1/7) tumor regression, as indicated by μCT scans and confirmed at necropsy, while
all control animals showed signs of disease progression (Fig. 4b, 4c, Extended Data Fig. 5,
Extended Data Table 2, Supplementary Videos 1-10). Histological analysis showed that in
the crizotinib group the tumors had undergone marked atrophy or were replaced by areas of
intense inflammatory necrosis (Fig. 4d, 4e).

HHMI Author Manuscript

Collectively, these results demonstrate that the CRISPR technology can be adapted to
engineer oncogenic chromosomal rearrangements in mice. The new mouse model of Eml4Alk-driven lung cancer we have generated to validate this approach faithfully recapitulates
the molecular and biological properties of human ALK+ NSCLCS, including a marked
sensitivity to the ALK-inhibitor crizotinib. This model provides unique opportunities to
dissect the molecular mechanisms through which Eml4-Alk drives tumor formation, to test
the efficacy of targeted therapies, and to investigate the mechanisms of drug resistance in
vivo.
The CRISPR-based strategy described here offers several advantages over germline
engineering via transgenesis or homologous recombination. By inducing the rearrangement
in only a subset of somatic cells, the resulting lesions more closely recapitulate the
stochastic nature of tumor formation in humans. In addition, by modifying the endogenous
loci, expression of the resulting fusion genes is subjected to physiologic transcriptional and
post-transcriptional regulation, accurately modeling the reduced dosage of the wild type
alleles and the expression of the reciprocal product of the translocation/inversion. Finally,
because our method requires only the generation of an appropriate viral vector and no

germline manipulations, it can be readily adapted to model chromosomal rearrangements in
other species, including non-human primates, and as such will facilitate the study of speciesspecific differences in tumor progression and therapy response in vivo.

HHMI Author Manuscript

Despite these key advantages, some caveats of the CRISPR technology must also be
considered. The efficiency with which the rearrangements are induced is relatively low and
is likely to be affected by the distance between the cut sites and their accessibility to Cas9.
While a low efficiency may be desirable when inducing oncogenic rearrangements, it is a
concern if the goal is to generate chromosomal rearrangements in the majority of cells.
Furthermore, every possible allele combination of the two target loci (indels, inversions,
deletions) will be induced by the dual sgRNA/Cas9 system30, potentially complicating the
interpretation of these studies.
In summary, the general strategy we have developed substantially expands our ability to
model cancers driven by chromosomal rearrangements and will facilitate the development of
pre-clinical models to study the mechanisms of drug resistance and test novel therapies.

Methods

Plasmids and adenoviral vectors

HHMI Author Manuscript

The pX330 vector expressing Cas9 (Addgene plasmid 42230) was digested with BbsI and
ligated to annealed and phosphorylated sgRNA oligos targeting Eml4, Alk, and Npm1. For
cloning of tandem U6-sgRNA-Cas9 constructs, the second U6-sgRNA cassette was
amplified using primers containing the XbaI and KpnI sites and cloned into the pX330
construct containing the appropriate sgRNA. For Adeno-Eml4-Alk cloning, pX330-AlkEml4 vector was modified by adding an XhoI site upstream the first U6 promoter. An
EcoRI-XhoI fragment containing the double U6-sgRNA cassette and the Flag-tagged Cas9
was then ligated the EcoRI-XhoI-digested pacAd5 shuttle vector. NIH/3T3 cells were
transfected in 6-well plates with 3 μg of total plasmid DNA per well using lipofectamine
2000 (Invitrogen) following manufacturer's instructions. To enrich for transfected cells,
transfections included 1 μg of a plasmid expressing the Puro-resistance gene (pSico) and
cells were incubated with 2 μg/ml Puromycin for 2 days. Recombinant adenoviruses were
generated by Viraquest (Ad-EA and Ad-Cas9) or purchased from the University of Iowa
(Ad-Cre). MEFs infections were performed by adding Adenovirus (3×106 PFU) to each well
of a 6-well plate.
PCR and RT-PCR analysis
For PCR analysis of genomic DNA, cells were collected in lysis buffer (100 nM Tris-HCl
pH 8.5, 5 mM EDTA, 0.2% SDS, 200 mM NaCl supplemented with fresh proteinase K at
final concentration of 100 ng/ml). Genomic DNA was extracted with phenol-chloroformisoamylic alcohol and precipitated in ethanol. The DNA pellet was dried and re-suspended
in double-distilled water. For RT-PCR, total RNAs were extracted with Trizol (Life
Technologies) following manufacturer's instructions. cDNAs were prepared using the
Superscript III kit, following manufacturer's instructions. The primers and the primer pairs
used in the various PCR reactions are provided in Extended Table 3 and Extended Table 4.

Quantification of inversion efficiency in MEFs

HHMI Author Manuscript

We first isolated an NIH/3T3 subclone carrying a mono-allelic Eml4-Alk inversion validated
by interphase FISH. Genomic DNA extracted from this clone was mixed with increasing
amounts of genomic DNA from parental NIH/3T3 cells to generate a series of standards
containing known percentage of Eml4-Alk alleles. The standards and the test samples were
then subjected to quantitative PCR (Applied Biosystem) using primers amplifying the Eml4Alk junction (Eml4-for and Alk-rev, see Extended Data Table 3) or a control gene
(miR-17~92-gDNA-for and miR-17~92-gDNA-rev) and the fraction of Eml4-Alk alleles in
the test was calculated by plotting the ΔΔCt values on the standard curve. qPCR analysis
was performed using Syber Green (Life Technology).
Cell lines
MEFs were generated from E14.5 wild type embryos following standard procedures.
NIH/3T3 were purchased from ATCC.
Mouse husbandry and adenoviral infection

HHMI Author Manuscript

Mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory (C57BL/6J) or from Charles River
(CD1) and housed in the SPF MSKCC animal facility, where the health status of the colony
is constantly monitored by the veterinary staff and by a sentinel program. For adenoviral
infection, 6-10-week-old mice were anesthetized by intra peritoneal injection of ketamine
(80 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg) and treated by intratracheal instillation of 1.5×108 PFU
adenovirus/mouse, as previously described26. Investigators were not blinded with respect to
which adenovirus was injected. All studies and procedures were approved by the Memorial
Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.
Interphase Fluorescent In Situ Hybridization

HHMI Author Manuscript

Interphase FISH experiments were performed and interpreted by the MSKCC cytogenetic
core using a 3-color probe mix designed to detect and discriminate between Alk-Eml4 fusion
and other rearrangements of Alk. The probe mix comprised mouse BAC clones mapping to:
3’Alk (17qE1.3, RP23-306H20, RP23-397M18 labeled with Green dUTP), 5’Alk (17qE1.3,
RP23-12H17, RP23-403F20 labeled with Red dUTP), and 5’Eml4 (17qE4, RP23-193B15
labeled with Orange dUTP). Probe labeling, hybridization, washing, and fluorescence
detection were done according to standard procedures. Cell line harvest and metaphase
spreads were prepared according to standard cytogenetics procedures. For NIH/3T3, FISH
signals were enumerated in a minimum of 20 metaphases to determine locus specificity, and
100 interphase cells to determine Alk-Eml4 fusion status. Each paraffin section was first
scanned under 100× objective to assess signal pattern and select representative regions for
analysis. At least three images per representative region were captured (each image was a
compressed stack of 12 z-sections at 0.5 micron intervals). Signal counts were performed on
the captured images and a minimum of 50 interphase nuclei was analyzed to determine the
Alk-Eml4 fusion status. Based on the observed distance between the Green (3’Alk), Red
(5’Alk), and Orange (5’Eml4) signal in the negative controls (parental cell line and Ad-Creinfected cells), interphase cells were classified as normal, Eml4-Alk positive, or other.

Surveyor assay

HHMI Author Manuscript

The genomic region flanking the CRISPR/Cas9 target site was first amplified by PCR. After
a cycle of melting and re-annealing to allow heteroduplex formation, the amplicon was
digested with the surveyor nuclease (Transgenomic) for 1 hour at 42°C according to
manufacturer's directions and the digestion products were separated on a 2% agarose gel.
Northern blot analysis
10 μg of RNA previously extracted with Trizol (Life Technologies) were run on a 15%
denaturing polyacrylamide gel and blotted on a nitrocellulose membrane for 1 hour at 100 V
at room temperature. The membranes were then hybridized to radiolabeled oligonucleotides
complementary to the Alk (5’-TACAGATAGACATGCCAGGAC), Eml4 (5’TCCTAGTAGACCCCGACAAAC) sgRNAs, or mU6 (5'GCAGGGGCCATGCTAATCTTCTCTGTATCG) dissolved in ExpressHyb (Clontech) at
42°C overnight. Washes were performed at room temperature in 2X SSC and 0.2 SSC.
Lung processing and Antibodies for immunohistochemistry

HHMI Author Manuscript

Lungs were inflated by intratracheal injection of 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA), incubated for
18-24 hours in 4% PFA, and then transferred to 70% ethanol for at least 24 hours before
further processing. The following antibodies were used: Phospho-Stat3 (Tyr705, Cell
Signaling Technology #9135, 0.1 μg/ml); Phospho-Erk1/2 (Thr202/Tyr204, Cell Signaling
Technology #4370 1 μg/ml); Phospho-Akt (Ser473, Cell Signaling Technology #4060 1 μg/
ml); Nkx-2.1 (Epitomics, EP1584Y 1:1200); FLAG (Sigma, M2 1:1000); P63 (Santa Cruz
(H-137) sc8343, 1:1000); Sox2 (Cell Signaling Technology, C70B1 #3728, 1:1000); CC10/
CCSP (Millipore, 07-623, 1:2000); SpC (Millipore, AB3786, 1:1000).
μCT imaging

HHMI Author Manuscript

μCT Scans were performed on the Mediso Nano SPECT/CT System covering only the lung
fields of each mouse. Each scan averaged approximately 5 minutes using 240 projections
with an exposure time of 1000 ms set at a pitch of 1 degree. The tube energy of the x-ray
was 55 kVp and 145 μA. The in-plane voxel sizes chosen were small and thin creating a
voxel size of 73 × 73 × 73 μm. The final reconstructed image consisted of 368 × 368 × 1897
voxels. Scans were analyzed with the Osirix software.
Crizotinib treatment
Mice were randomized to receive either control vehicle (water) or crizotinib at 100 mg/kg
p.o. daily for at least 14 consecutive days. Mice were monitored daily for weight loss and
clinical signs. Investigators were not blind with respect to treatment.
