Abstract
The Hippo pathway regulates organ size and tumorigenesis in Drosophila and mammals and is altered in a
variety of human cancers, yet it remains unclear if the Hippo pathway is of prognostic significance to cancer
patients. Here we show that the key targets of Hippo signaling, transcriptional coactivators Yki and Yap, play a
conserved role in promoting ovarian cancer in flies and humans, respectively. Whereas studies linking Yap to
cancer in other tissues have focused on overall Yap levels, we show for the first time that subcellular levels of
Yap show an exceptionally strong association with poor patient survival. Specifically, high levels of nuclear Yap
(nYap), or low levels of cytoplasmic phosphorylated Yap (cpYap), associated with poor survival from ovarian
cancer. Patients with both high nYap and low cpYap had ∼50% lower 5-year survival, and this combination is
an independent prognostic marker for survival, with an exceptionally high hazard ratio of 7.8. We find that
Yap2 is the predominantly expressed Yap isoform in both the ovarian surface epithelium (OSE) and epithelial
ovarian cancers. Overexpression of Yap2 and phosphorylation-defective Yap2-5SA in immortalized OSE cells
resulted in increased cell proliferation, resistance to cisplatin-induced apoptosis, faster cell migration, and
anchorage-independent growth, whereas Yap knockdown resulted in increased sensitivity to cisplatin-induced
apoptosis. Findings argue that the Hippo signaling pathway defines an important pathway in progression of
ovarian cancer. Cancer Res; 70(21); 8517–25. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Epithelial ovarian cancer is the most lethal gynecologic
malignancy and is the fifth most prevalent cause of cancer
death in women in the United States (1). Due to the internal
localization of the ovaries, lack of specific symptoms, and
lack of effective screening methods, ovarian cancer usually
remains undetected until it has reached an advanced stage
(2). Nearly 70% of patients present with late-stage disease
that has spread to other organs in the abdominal cavity,
and the 5-year survival for these patients remains at only
30% (1). The current standard of care includes surgical resection of the tumor followed by treatment with platinum- and
taxane-based chemotherapies (3).

An important step in the development of more targeted
and personalized treatments for ovarian cancer is identification of molecules involved in its development and progression. One method for identifying such molecules is through
the study of model organisms. Several laboratories have
developed mouse models of ovarian cancer through targeted
disruption or expression of candidate ovarian cancer tumor
suppressors and oncogenes in the proposed site of origin of
ovarian cancer—the ovarian surface epithelium (OSE; ref. 4).
Although useful for the characterization of candidate molecules, the mammalian ovary does not lend itself to large-scale
forward genetic screens that can identify new molecules.
We hypothesized that the Drosophila ovary might serve as
a powerful genetic model to screen for molecules disrupted
in human ovarian cancer. Mutations in basolateral junction
proteins discs large, lethal giant larvae, and scribble in the fly
ovary result in tumor-like phenotypes, including overproliferation, loss of cell polarity, and invasion (5–7). To identify
new molecules involved in ovarian tumorigenesis, we performed a large-scale genetic modifier screen for genes that
enhance the discs large ovarian tumor phenotype, and identified warts. Further analysis revealed that warts loss alone
caused tumors in the Drosophila ovary (7).
Warts is a kinase that regulates organ size and tumorigenesis in many fly tissues. Warts acts in a network of tumor
suppressors that encode receptor, scaffolding, and signaling
molecules, collectively known as the Hippo pathway, whose
crucial function is to repress oncogene Yki, a transcriptional
coactivator (8). In mammals, Warts homologues Lats-1 and
Lats-2 phosphorylate the Yki homologue Yap (Yes-associated
protein; ref. 9) at S127, allowing 14-3-3 to bind Yap and retain

it in the cytoplasm, thus blocking the ability of Yap to coactivate transcription in the nucleus (8). Yap is located in a
genomic region, 11q22, which is amplified in a variety of cancers including ovarian cancer, and Yap levels predict patient
outcome in hepatocellular carcinoma (10, 11). Further, Yap
overexpression in the murine liver causes massive liver overgrowth and tumorigenesis (12).
Here, we report that overexpression of human Yap induces
tumorigenesis in the Drosophila ovary, suggesting that it
plays a conserved role in ovarian tumorigenesis. Consistent
with a role for Yap in human ovarian cancer, we found that
high nuclear Yap (nYap) and low cytoplasmic phosphorylated S127-Yap (cpYap) are associated with poor survival.
Further, we found that overexpression of Yap2, or a phosphorylation-resistant allele of Yap2, Yap2-5SA, in immortalized OSE (IOSE) cells resulted in increased proliferation,
resistance to cisplatin-induced apoptosis, loss of contact inhibition, increased cell migration, and anchorage-independent
growth. Together, these findings indicate that Yap acts as an
oncogene in ovarian cancer by promoting disease progression
and development of chemoresistance.

Materials and Methods
Drosophila
Yap-overexpressing flies were constructed using the FLPout technique. Adult female y,w,hs-FLP; act>y+>Gal4, UASGFP/UAS-Yap-S127A flies were heat shocked at 37°C for
2 minutes and then incubated at 25°C for 3 days. Ovaries
were dissected and processed as described (7).
Human tissue samples
The tissue microarray (TMA) was composed of two blocks
with cores in duplicate from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded
archival primary ovarian carcinoma samples from 70 patients
(median age, 59.8; range, 22–93; Table 1). The patients had
been treated at the Massachusetts General Hospital from
1989 to 2004 under an Institutional Review Board–approved
protocol. H&E sections of all samples were reviewed by a
certified gynecologic pathologist who selected tumor cores.
Immunohistochemistry
Normal ovary sections and the ovarian cancer TMA were
analyzed by immunohistochemistry as described (13). No
antigen retrieval was used for anti-Yap (1:100; H-125; Santa
Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), and 0.01 mol/L citrate buffer
(pH 6.0) was used for anti–phosphorylated S127-Yap (1:50;
4911S; Cell Signaling Technology). Immunostained slides
were evaluated for both nuclear and cytoplasmic Yap and
pYap as described (14) by three independent scorers [T.W.
(certified pathologist), C.A.H., and S.O. or S.G.] who were
blinded to the data. Scores were combined using a two-third
majority. Proportion scores did not vary considerably across
samples and were not analyzed. Intensity scores 0 (none) and
1 (weak) were assigned to the low category, and 2 (intermediate) and 3 (strong) were assigned to the high category for
both Yap and pYap.

Cell lines
All cell lines were grown in a 1:1 mixture of MCDB 105
medium (Sigma-Aldrich Co.) and Medium 199 (SigmaAldrich) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS),
25 μg/mL gentamicin, 10 units/mL penicillin, and 10 ng/mL
streptomycin. The IOSE-80 cell line (15), which normally
senesces around passage 20, was immortalized by infection
with a hTERT-expressing retrovirus (Addgene plasmid
1774), followed by selection with 100 μg/mL G418 for 10 days.
The resulting cell line, 80T, is able to grow for at least 90 passages. Yap knockdown lines were made by infecting 80T cells
with pGIPZ lentiviruses from Open Biosystems per the manufacturer's instructions followed by selection with 1 μg/mL
puromycin for 10 days. Yap-overexpressing cell lines were

made by infecting 80T cells with pQCXIH-myc retroviruses
containing Yap2 or Yap2-5SA (16), followed by selection with
200 μg/mL hygromycin for 10 days. The approximate percentage of cells in each culture expressing the indicated constructs after selection was as follows: nontargeting (90%),
shYap7 (50%), shYap8 (80%), shYap9 (80%), empty vector
(not measurable), Yap2 (60%), and Yap2-5SA (90%).
Sequence analysis
Whole RNA was isolated from tumors and reverse transcribed using the iScript cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad). Yap
fragments were PCR amplified from cDNAs. T7 or T3
sequence was added upstream of the following Yap-specific
primers: Yap left forward, CCGGGCATCAGATCGTGCA;
Yap left reverse, GCTGAAGCCGAGTTCATCAT; Yap right
forward, TTCAGCCATGAACCAGAGAA; Yap right reverse,
AGTCTGCCTGAGGGCTCTA. PCR products were sequenced
(LoneStar Labs) using T7 and T3 primers and analyzed for
mutation using Sequencher software.
Western blot analysis
Cells were harvested in radioimmunoprecipitation assay
buffer (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), subjected to SDS-PAGE,
and processed per antibody manufacturer's instruction (BD
Biosciences). Antibodies were used as follows: anti-Yap
(1:500; H-125; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti–phosphorylated
S127-Yap (1:500; 4911S; Cell Signaling Technology), anti–
cleaved caspase-3 (1:1,000; 9661S; Cell Signaling Technology),
anti–caspase-8 (1:1,000; 3-1-9; BD Biosciences), anti–Lats-1
(1:200; A300-478A; Bethyl Laboratories, Inc.), anti–Lats-2
(1:200; ST-3D10; CycLex Corp.), and anti-actin (AC40; 1:40,000;
Sigma-Aldrich).
Immunofluorescence and imaging
Cell lines and Drosophila ovaries were stained as described
(7) with anti-myc (1:500; 9E10; BD Biosciences), Alexa Fluor
647–conjugated phalloidin (1:100; Invitrogen), and propidium iodide. Tissues were visualized using a Zeiss LSM confocal microscope, and images were minimally adjusted for
brightness and contrast using the Zeiss LSM510 Image
Browser software.
Cell proliferation assays
For the cell count assay, 10,000 cells were plated in triplicate in 12-well plates and counted on days 1 and 6 (before
confluence) using a Beckman Coulter Z1 Particle Counter.
To establish a mitotic index, 10,000 cells were plated on
coverslips, grown for 4 days, and stained with propidium
iodide. Twenty images were captured per genotype,
and the mitotic index (number of nuclei with condensed
chromosomes divided by total number of nuclei) was
scored.
Apoptosis assay
Cells were incubated in medium containing 30 μmol/L
cisplatin (400-040-M050; Alexis Biochemicals) for 48 hours.
Floating and adherent cells were harvested for Western
blot analysis.

Scratch assay
Cells (2.5 × 106) were plated in T25 flasks with medium
containing 10 μg/mL mitomycin C to block proliferation.
Twelve hours later, cells were scratched using a 200 μL
pipette and medium was replaced. Images of 10 scratches
per cell line were captured after 30-minute recovery and at
the same location 10 hours later. Scratch areas were measured using Zeiss AxioVision Software 4.6.
Soft agar assay
Cells (5,000) were plated in complete medium plus 0.5%
agar in six-well plates in triplicate. Medium was replaced
every 3 days. After 14 days, cells were stained with 2 mL of
0.5 mg/mL MTT for 2 hours. Visible colonies were counted.
Statistical analysis
For TMA data, clinical and immunohistochemistry variables were summarized descriptively (Table 1). For the 65
subjects with complete immunohistochemical and outcome
data, disease-specific survival, truncated at 5 years, was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method and compared across
groups (see below) using the log-rank test. Patients that
survived, dropped out of the study, or died for reasons unrelated to cancer were censored at the lesser of the last followup time or 5 years. The contribution of dichotomized nYap
(low = 0, 1 versus high = 2, 3), dichotomized cpYap (low = 0, 1
versus high = 2, 3), or their combined dichotomized nY/cpY
category (3 versus 0, 1, 2), independent of other clinicopathologic variables, was analyzed by stepwise Cox proportional
hazards regression modeling. The following clinicopathologic
variables were considered (categorized as indicated): stage
(1, 2, 3, 4 treated as a single “continuous” variable because
univariate analysis indicated that this was a reasonable representation), dichotomized grade [high = 3 versus other including ungraded (n = 2)], and dichotomized histology
(serous versus other).
Cell culture experiments were done at least in triplicate
and repeated at least three times. Western blot and immunofluorescence experiments were repeated at least three times.
Student's paired t test was used to compare each measured value with control. P values of <0.05 were considered
significant.

Results
Human Yap-S127A induces tumorigenesis in the
Drosophila ovary
Loss-of-function clones of warts in the fly ovarian follicular
epithelium results in tumor formation (7). We thus tested if
the key Warts target, Yki, also induces tumors. Using the
FLP-out technique, we overexpressed wild-type Yki and
phosphorylation-resistant Yki-S168A in the Drosophila
ovarian follicular epithelium and found that Yki-S168A, but
not wild-type Yki, induced tumorigenesis (Fig. 1; data
not shown). To test if the human homologue of Yki, Yap,
might play a conserved role in ovarian tumorigenesis, we
overexpressed wild-type Yap and a phosphorylation-resistant
allele of Yap, Yap-S127A, in the Drosophila ovarian follicular

tumors, but did not detect any nonsynonymous mutations.
We conclude that Yap is not frequently mutated at any of
the five Lats consensus binding/phosphorylation sites in
ovarian cancer. We cannot rule out that Yap might be activated by mutation at low frequency and/or at other sites in
ovarian cancer.
Yap is not overexpressed or underphosphorylated
at S127 in ovarian cancer cell lines
Others have shown that Yap is overexpressed in hepatocellular carcinoma (11). To test if Yap is overexpressed in
ovarian cancer, we performed Western blot analysis on 10
ovarian cancer cell lines and 2 IOSE cell lines (Supplementary
Fig. S1A). Using an antibody raised against a fragment of
Yap1 that is contained in Yap2 and Yap2L, one prominent
65-kDa band corresponding to Yap2 (see below) was evident
by Western blot analysis. Yap2 was expressed in all cell lines,
and Yap2 levels varied to a similar extent in ovarian cancer
cells and control cell lines. Because Yap is inhibited by phosphorylation at S127 by Lats-1 or Lats-2 kinases (16), we also
asked if Lats kinases are expressed and if Yap is phosphorylated in ovarian cancer cell lines (Supplementary Fig. S1A).
Lats-1 and Lats-2 were expressed in all cell lines and pYap
levels varied to a similar extent in ovarian cancer and control
cell lines (Supplementary Fig. S1A). We conclude that Yap is
not overexpressed and that Yap phosphorylation at S127 is
not grossly misregulated in ovarian cancer cell lines.

epithelium. Similar to Yki, expression of wild-type Yap had
no effect, whereas expression of Yap-S127A resulted in overproliferation and loss of epithelial architecture beginning at
mid-oogenesis (data not shown; Fig. 1). We conclude that
the oncogenic capacity of Yki in the fly ovary is conserved
in human Yap.
Yap does not seem to have activating mutations
in ovarian cancer
Because activating mutations in Yap are able to induce
tumors in the fly ovary, we reasoned that Yap might be activated by mutation in ovarian cancer. Mutation of any of the
five Lats consensus binding/phosphorylation sites in Yap (16)
could result in constitutive activation of Yap. We sequenced
these sites in cDNAs synthesized from whole-cell RNA from
10 ovarian cancer cell lines, 2 IOSE cell lines, and 17 ovarian

Subcellular levels of Yap and pYap correlate with
ovarian cancer survival
To further explore the possibility that Yap is misregulated
in ovarian cancer, we reasoned that because cytoplasmic
retention is the primary mechanism controlling Yap nuclear
accumulation (8), Yap subcellular distribution might correlate with patient survival in ovarian cancer. After verifying
the specificity of our Yap and pYap antibodies (Supplementary Fig. S1B), we established the normal expression pattern
of Yap and pYap by staining normal OSE (NOSE). Similar to a
previous report, Yap staining was low or undetectable in most
(five of seven) samples (17). When Yap was expressed in the
OSE, it localized predominantly to the nucleus and pYap
localized predominantly to the cytoplasm (Fig. 2A).
To determine if Yap distribution correlates with patient
survival in ovarian cancer, Yap and pYap localization and
levels were evaluated in 70 tumors on an ovarian cancer
TMA, which contained a mixture of serous, clear cell, endometrioid, mucinous, and transitional carcinomas (Table 1).
Kaplan-Meier estimation and comparison of disease-specific
survival found high nYap staining intensity (P = 0.002) to be
associated and low cytoplasmic pYap (cpYap) staining intensity (P = 0.07) to be marginally associated with poor patient
outcome (Fig. 2B). In contrast, cytoplasmic Yap staining
intensity and nuclear pYap staining intensity were not associated. Although nYap staining intensity remained a significant independent marker for poor patient survival [P =
0.0048; hazard ratio (HR), 3.3; 95% confidence interval (CI),
1.03–10.9] after considering other clinical factors (data not
shown), we sought to determine if the combination of nYap

and cpYap staining intensities showed an even stronger association with poor patient survival. We sorted each tumor into
one of four categories based on the combination of nYap and
cpYap staining intensities (Table 1). Survival in patients with
both high nYap and low cpYap (nY/cpY category 3) was significantly worse than the other categories, which were combined
because they were indistinguishable from each other on univariate survival analysis (Fig. 2B). On multivariate Cox regression analysis that considered stage, high grade, serous
histology, dichotomized nYap score, dichotomized cpYap
score, and the dichotomized nY/cpY category (3 versus other),
only stage (P < 0.001; HR, 7.0; 95% CI, 3.0–16.5) and nY/cpY
category (P = 0.002; HR, 7.8; 95% CI, 2.1–28.9) were significant.
We conclude that the combination of high nYap and low
cpYap is a strong independent predictor of disease-specific
survival for ovarian cancer.
Yap overexpression promotes proliferation and
resistance to apoptosis
Correlations between Yap staining and poor patient
survival do not distinguish whether Yap merely correlates
with ovarian cancer outcome or if Yap is an active driver

of the disease. To determine if Yap is an active driver
of ovarian cancer progression, we used an IOSE cell line,
80T, as an in vitro model. cDNA sequencing (above) indicated that Yap2 was the predominantly expressed Yap isoform in NOSE, IOSE, and ovarian cancer cell lines. Yap1
and Yap2L transcripts were also detected but at relatively
low levels.
Therefore, to obtain IOSE cells with high nYap, as observed
in ovarian tumors, we overexpressed Yap2, which would be
expected to increase nYap by mass action, and Yap2-5SA,
which is resistant to cytoplasmic retention due to mutation
of all five Lats phosphorylation sites (Fig. 3A; ref. 16). Additionally, we knocked down Yap with short hairpin RNAs
(shRNA; Fig. 3A). Consistent with Yap2 being the predominantly expressed isoform in 80T cells, overexpressed Yap2,
which is myc-tagged, ran only slightly higher than the endogenously expressed isoform (Fig. 3A). We also determined the
localization of Yap in Yap2- and Yap2-5SA–overexpressing
cell lines (Fig. 3A). Although most overexpressed Yap localizes in the cytoplasm, there is more nYap in cells overexpressing Yap2 and Yap2-5SA compared with control cells (Fig. 3A;
Supplementary Fig. S1B).

could be due to increased proliferation, decreased cell death,
or both. To determine if Yap2- and Yap2-5SA–overexpressing

cells had increased proliferation, we established their mitotic
index (Fig. 3B). Yap2 or Yap2-5SA overexpression resulted in
significantly higher mitotic index compared with control,
suggesting that these cultures were more proliferative. We
asked if this effect might be mediated by the epidermal
growth factor (EGF) family ligand amphiregulin, a protein
implicated in ovarian cancer, and that acts downstream of
Yap in breast cells to promote proliferation (2, 18). Amphiregulin levels were unchanged in 80T cells overexpressing

Yap2 or Yap2-5SA by both Western blot and immunohistochemical analysis (data not shown).
To determine if Yap expression decreases cell death, we
challenged with cisplatin, one of the most commonly used
ovarian cancer chemotherapeutic agents (3). After 48 hours
of treatment, Yap2- or Yap2-5SA–overexpressing cells remained adherent to the culture dish, whereas control and
shYap cells rounded up and detached (Fig. 3C), suggesting
that Yap2 overexpression protects from apoptosis. To test

caspases, caspase-8 and caspase-3, respectively (19). Yap
knockdown resulted in higher levels of both cleaved caspases, whereas overexpression of Yap2 and Yap2-5SA showed
decreased levels of cleaved caspase-8, increased levels of
full-length caspase-8, and a small, but reproducible, decrease
in cleaved caspase-3 (Fig. 3C). We conclude that overexpression of Yap2 or Yap2-5SA results in increased proliferation
and decreased cisplatin-induced apoptosis, whereas Yap
knockdown results in increased cisplatin-induced apoptosis.
Yap overexpression reduces contact inhibition
and promotes movement and anchorageindependent growth
In addition to increased growth, aggressive tumor cells
undergo epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), lose
contact inhibition, develop increased motility, and develop
anchorage-independent growth. We investigated these
processes in Yap-overexpressing and knockdown cells. We
noticed that when Yap2- and Yap2-5SA–overexpressing cells
reached full confluence, cell density was higher (Fig. 4A),
indicating loss of contact inhibition. We also found that overexpression of Yap2-5SA, but not overexpression of Yap2 or
Yap knockdown, resulted in significantly faster wound closure (Fig. 4B). Further, cells overexpressing Yap2 and Yap25SA formed colonies in soft agar (Fig. 4C), whereas control
cells and cells with diminished Yap were unable to grow.
We conclude that Yap promotes loss of contact inhibition,
cell migration, and growth in soft agar.
EMT is often associated with loss of contact inhibition,
increased cell migration, and increased growth in soft agar,
and Yap has been shown to induce EMT in human mammary
epithelial cells (20). However, 80T cells already appear mesenchymal (Figs. 3A and C and 4B), express mesenchymal
markers (fibronectin and vimentin), and do not express
epithelial markers (E-cadherin, occludin, or β-catenin; data
not shown). Yap knockdown and Yap2 or Yap2-5SA overexpression did not alter the expression of these markers (data
not shown). We conclude that Yap can promote loss of contact inhibition, cell migration, and growth in soft agar independent of EMT.

Discussion
We found that, similar to Yki, phosphorylation-resistant
human Yap is able to induce ovarian tumors when expressed
in the Drosophila ovary, suggesting that the ability of Yap and
Yki to induce ovarian tumorigenesis is conserved. Although
we found no evidence of activating mutations in Yap in ovarian cancers, or for Yap overexpression in cell lines, we found
that subcellular levels of Yap and pYap correlate and tend
to associate, respectively, with survival of ovarian cancer
patients. Consistent with a role for Yap in ovarian cancer
progression, we find that overexpression of Yap2 and
phosphorylation-defective Yap2-5SA in 80T cells resulted in
several phenotypes associated with cancer, including increased proliferation, resistance to cisplatin-induced apopto-

sis, faster cell migration, and anchorage-independent growth,
whereas knockdown of Yap in these cells resulted in
increased sensitivity to cisplatin-induced apoptosis.
Paradoxically, Yap has been shown to act as both a tumor
suppressor and an oncogene in breast cancer (20, 21). However, neither of these studies attempted to correlate Yap
expression with patient outcome, which would help resolve
this controversy. Three lines of evidence refute a role for Yap
as a tumor suppressor in ovarian cancer. First, low nYap
expression in ovarian tumors correlated with better diseasespecific survival. Second, Yap was not lost or dramatically
downregulated in 10 ovarian cancer cell lines. Third, Yap
knockdown in 80T cells did not result in phenotypes associated
with cancer. In fact, Yap knockdown cells were more sensitive
to cisplatin-induced apoptosis than control cells (Fig. 3C).
Although the sample size is modest and should be interpreted cautiously, Yap seems to be a powerful prognostic
marker of poor survival in ovarian cancer. Cox regression
analysis of the nY/cpY category (3 versus 0, 1, 2,) revealed
an exceptionally high HR of 7.7 (comparable with the HR
of 7.0 for stage), indicating that, in our data set, patients with
both high nYap and low cpYap are at nearly eight times
greater risk of death from the disease than other patients.
This HR is substantially higher than the HR for nYap staining
alone (HR, 3.3). There could be two explanations for this finding. First, immunohistochemical studies of archival tumor
samples can be confounded by both systematic and random
errors such as intersample and intrasample heterogeneity
and differences in the age, fixation, processing, staining, and
scoring of tumor samples. Therefore, two independent measures of the same marker would be expected to reduce error.
Second, the nY/cpY category might reflect the activity of Yap
in the tumor. Yap is phosphorylated at S127 by Lats kinases
and retained in the cytoplasm by 14-3-3 (8). When Yap is
localized in the nucleus, it is likely transcriptionally active,
and thus, intense nYap staining suggests high Yap activity.
In contrast, when Yap is phosphorylated and in the cytoplasm,
Yap is presumably transcriptionally inactive, and thus, intense
cpYap staining suggests low Yap activity. Thus, tumors in nY/
cpY category 3, which have high levels of nYap and low
levels of cpYap, might be expected to have the highest Yap
activity. Analysis of the levels of Yap target genes in each
nY/cpY category might shed light on these two possibilities.
An important question that remains is the mechanism of
Yap misregulation in ovarian cancer. We found no evidence
for Yap protein amplification or for Yap-activating mutations.
Further, pYap staining was detectable in 63 of 70 ovarian
tumors and in all ovarian cancer cell lines (Supplementary
Fig. S1A), indicating that increased nYap does not likely result
from complete loss of phosphorylation. A variety of mechanisms have been described in Drosophila that alter Yki levels
and subcellular localization (8), providing several possible
mechanisms by which nYap levels may increase in human
ovarian cancer. Elucidation of these mechanisms will likely
provide insight for therapeutic intervention targeting Yap.
Our results support the notion that Yap might be an excellent therapeutic target for the treatment of ovarian cancer.
Although our sample size is modest and our analysis needs

to be confirmed in a larger patient population, Yap distribution
seems to be a very strong predictor of survival from ovarian
cancer. Even if further analysis reveals that the HR for
nY/cpY category 3 is at the low end of our 95% CI (2.1–28.9),
this would be on par with EGF and Her-2/neu, which are
currently targeted in clinical trials for ovarian cancer treatments (22, 23). Further, Yap activation results in several
cancer-associated phenotypes, whereas reduction of Yap
resulted only in increased sensitivity to chemotherapy, indicating that therapies targeting Yap could affect multiple
cancer processes with minimal deleterious effects.
The Drosophila ovarian follicular epithelium and human
OSE are female-specific tissues that share many important
properties including mesodermal origin, monolayer cuboidal
epithelial organization, hormone dependency, and the ability
to undergo dynamic remodeling (7, 24–26). The results presented here support the notion that the Drosophila follicular
epithelium is a useful tool for the discovery of genes crucial
to the pathogenesis of ovarian cancer.
