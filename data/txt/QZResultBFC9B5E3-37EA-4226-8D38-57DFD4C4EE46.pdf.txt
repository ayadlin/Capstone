Emesis Predicts Bacteremia in
Immunocompromised Children With
Central Venous Catheters and Fever
Matthew W. Richardson, MD1; Satkiran S. Grewal, MD1; and Paul F. Visintainer, PhD2

BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to determine whether vomiting at presentation of a febrile
illness in immunocompromised children with central venous catheters (CVCs) predicts bacteremia.
METHODS: A chart review was conducted of children who were admitted to the hospital with a diagnosis
of cancer or aplastic anemia, fever, and a CVC. Data were collected on the presence or absence of vomiting, catheter type, presence or absence of severe neutropenia, C-reactive protein (Crp) value, and culture
results. RESULTS: There were 143 admissions for fever among 48 children. Among 35 admissions with
emesis, 19 included bacteremia; whereas, among 107 admissions without emesis, 19 included bacteremia
(P < .001). There was a 5-fold greater risk of bacteremia in children with children without vomiting (odds
ratio, 5.50; 95% confidence interval, 2.20-13.67). Gram-negative organisms were more likely to be associated with vomiting than Gram-positive organisms (P ¼ .008). Children with severe neutropenia did not
have a significantly higher rate of bacteremia than children who had neutrophil counts >500 cells/mm3.
Other factors that were associated with higher rates of bacteremia were underlying diagnosis and catheter
type. CONCLUSIONS: Immunocompromised children with a CVC and a fever who presented with vomiting
were more likely to have bacteremia than similar children who presented without vomiting. Gram-negative
organisms were more likely to be associated with emesis than Gram-positive organisms. The absence of
severe neutropenia was not associated with a decreased likelihood of bacteremia. These findings may be
useful in identifying children who are at high risk for bacteremia and in determining initial, empiric therapy.

Children who are undergoing treatment for cancer and those with aplastic anemia often require indwelling central venous catheters (CVCs) and commonly develop fever. The minority of these patients,
however, will have culture-proven bacteremia. Previous studies have identified clinical and laboratory features, such as underlying diagnosis, catheter type, or C-reactive protein (Crp) at presentation of fever, that
help predict which children will be more likely to have culture-proven bacteremia.1-4 This allows children
who have features associated with higher rates of bacteremia to receive empiric parenteral antibiotics in an
inpatient setting, whereas those who have lower risk features may be considered for early discharge or even

outpatient management. Clinical observations at our
institution led to the hypothesis that emesis at presentation of a febrile episode was predictive of bacteremia in
children with cancer or aplastic anemia and a CVC. To
our knowledge, this clinical sign has not been evaluated
previously as a predictor of bacteremia.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
We reviewed the charts of children who were admitted to
Baystate Children’s Hospital with a diagnosis of cancer or
aplastic anemia, a CVC, and fever between January 1,
2006 and April 11, 2008. Vomiting was considered present if it was noted in the admission history or within
24 hours of admission and was considered absent if the
history or review of systems documented its specific
absence. Data were collected on diagnosis, culture results,
type of CVC (implanted port vs tunneled external catheter), absolute neutrophil count (ANC) at presentation
(defined as either severe [ANC <500 cells/mm3] or not
severe [ANC >500 cells/mm3]), and Crp if available. It
was reported previously that a Crp level 4 mg/dL was
predictive of bacteremia in the pediatric oncology population; thus, we used this as a cutoff value to define an
elevated or ‘‘high’’ Crp.5

Statistical Methods
Categorical variables were compared using Fisher exact
test (2-sided). The risk of bacteremia compared across
clinical variables was computed as odds ratios (ORs) and
are reported with exact 95% confidence intervals (95%
CIs). Logistic regression was used to estimate the joint
contribution of several clinical variables together. A
receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and an area
under the curve (AUC) were generated for each logistic
model. Analyses were conducted in Stata software (version
10.1; StataCorp., College Station, Tex). P values <.05
were considered significant. The study was exempted
from Institutional Review Board approval.

RESULTS
There were 143 admissions for fever among 48 children
over the study period. In 1 episode, the presence or
absence of vomiting was not addressed in the medical
record, which left 142 episodes for the current analysis
(Fig. 1). Emesis was present in 35 episodes and was absent
in 107 episodes. One patient developed emesis within
24 hours of admission; the remaining patients (97%) had
emesis at the time of presentation with fever. Thirty-eight
episodes (27%) had positive blood cultures, including 21
episodes with Gram-negative organisms and 17 episodes
with Gram-positive bacteria (Fig. 2). Twenty patients
accounted for the 38 episodes of bacteremia, including 9
patients who had 2 admissions each and 11 patients who

There were 9 positive cultures for 23 emesis episodes
(39%) versus 12 positive cultures for 93 no-emesis
episodes (13%; P ¼ .007).

Emesis Versus No Emesis
Bacteremia was present in 19 patients (54%) in the emesis
group and in 19 patients (18%) in the no-emesis group
(P < .001) (Tables 1, 2). The risk of a positive blood culture in the presence of emesis was 5.5 times higher than in
the absence of emesis (OR, 5.50; 95% CI, 2.20-13.67):
The positive predictive value was 54%, and the negative
predictive value was 82%. Gram-negative organisms were
more common in the emesis group (79%) than in the noemesis group (32%; P ¼ .008). There was no significant
difference between the emesis group and the no-emesis
group in the frequency of severe neutropenia. When

bacteremia, or organisms cultured in patients who had
high Crp values and the rates for patients who had Crp
<4 mg/dL (Table 3). There was a trend toward higher
mean Crp levels in children who had emesis compared
with those who did not have emesis, but the difference did
not reach statistical significance. In subgroup analysis, the
group with emesis and Crp values >4 mg/dL had a higher
rate of bacteremia (80%) than the group with no emesis
and Crp values <4 mg/dL (13%; P < .001) (Table 4).
The odds ratio for bacteremia with emesis and Crp >4
mg/dL, relative to those with no emesis and Crp <4 mg/
dL, was 28.0 (95% CI, 3.70-307.45).

The AUC for the combination of catheter type and ANC
for predicting bacteremia was compared with the AUC
for catheter type, ANC, and emesis. The addition of emesis increased the AUC from 0.74 (95% CI, 0.66-0.83)
without emesis to 0.79 (95% CI, 0.71-0.88), but the difference did not reach significance (P ¼ .08). When Crp
(dichotomized at 4.0 mg/dL) was added to the base model
(ie, catheter type, ANC, and Crp), the addition of emesis
also increased the AUC from 0.75 (95% CI, 0.61-0.88)
to 0.82 (95% CI, 0.70-0.95); however, the difference did
not achieve statistical significance (P ¼ .08). When the
Crp value was included as a continuous variable, the addition of emesis to the base model in the AUC was significant at 0.75 (95% CI, 0.62-0.88) compared with 0.83
(95% CI, 0.70-0.96; P ¼ .048) (Fig. 3). There were no
deaths.

Other Factors

DISCUSSION

Underlying disease influenced the risk for bacteremia.
High-risk patients (those with AML, ALL in recurrence,
or BMT) had a higher rate of bacteremia than patients
who had other diagnoses (17 of 26 high-risk episodes
[65%] vs 21 of 116 episodes for other diagnoses [18%]; P
< .001). The rates of infection were also different for different catheter types. Children with external catheters
were more likely to have positive cultures (26 of 55; 47%)
compared with children who had implanted ports (12 of
87; 14%; P < .001). There was no difference in the rate of
Gram-negative infection between catheter types (15 of 26
episodes with tunneled external catheters [58%] vs 6 of 12
episodes with totally implanted ports [50%]; P ¼ .73).

Fever is 1 of the most common complications and reasons
for hospitalization among children who have cancer or
aplastic anemia and a CVC. Most of these episodes are
not associated with bacteremia and therefore may result in
an overuse of broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotic therapy and inpatient admission. This creates a burden on the
healthcare system, potentially increases development of
drug-resistant strains of bacteria, and places financial and
emotional stress on patients and their families. For these
reasons, studies have tried to identify clinical and laboratory features at the presentation of a febrile episode that
help predict the likelihood of bacteremia. This strategy
allows higher risk patients to receive empiric, broad-

spectrum parenteral antibiotics in the hospital, whereas
lower risk patients may receive modified regimens, including early discharge or even outpatient management. To
our knowledge, emesis has not been included previously
as a predictor of bacteremia.
Our data suggest that, in the pediatric hematology/
oncology population with fever and a CVC, the presence
of emesis has a strong association with bacteremia. Fiftyfour percent of such children had bacteremia identified.
By including the presence or absence of emesis in a predictive model using readily available clinical information
(catheter type, ANC, Crp), the area under the ROC curve
is increased. Although the increase in AUC only
approached statistical significance (P ¼ .08) when Crp
was used as a dichotomous variable, as it likely would be
in clinical practice, this may be because of the limited
number of children who had Crp evaluated (N ¼ 81).
With more data points, significance may have been
achieved.
The reason for this association of vomiting and bacteremia is not entirely clear. The finding that the vast
majority (97%) of patients who had emesis presented
with the sign/symptom suggests that an underlying illness
(eg, bacteremia, viral gastroenteritis, medicine side effect)
was responsible for the vomiting rather than an in-hospital intervention (eg, use of imipenem, which commonly is
associated with emesis). Bacteremia may cause vomiting

by a few mechanisms. The poor tissue perfusion that
accompanies bacteremia/sepsis results in tissue hypoxia
and organ dysfunction. In the case of gastric hypoperfusion, this may lead to delayed emptying and dysmotility.
In addition, endotoxins and lipopolysaccharides from
Gram-negative bacteria induce vomiting.6-8 Gram-negative organisms were significantly more common in the
emesis group than in the no-emesis group, supporting this
mechanism.
Although severe neutropenia (ANC <500 cells/
mm3) has been linked to poor outcomes in febrile cancer
patients,9 our study demonstrated that, in immunocompromised children with a CVC and fever, the presence or
absence of severe neutropenia at presentation did not predict the likelihood of bacteremia. These results are in concordance with a report by Schwartz et al, who observed no
significant difference in the incidence of bacteremia
between neutropenic and non-neutropenic pediatric cancer patients with CVCs (27.6% and 29.1%, respectively).10 A lack of severe neutropenia may lead to the
clinical judgment that a patient is less likely to be bacteremic, which may influence the decision of inpatient versus
outpatient management. Our results demonstrate that,
when fever is associated with a CVC and early-onset emesis, even in the absence of severe neutropenia, a high index
of suspicion for bacteremia should be entertained; in the
current study, almost 50% of these patients had cultureproven bacteremia, primarily with Gram-negative
organisms.
For the 81 episodes with Crp available, we did not
observe a higher rate of bacteremia for patients who had
Crp levels >4 mg/dL compared with patients who had
Crp levels <4 mg/dL. This is in disagreement with Santolaya et al, who reported that Crp levels >4 mg/dL were
100% sensitive for discriminating pediatric oncology
patients who had demonstrated bacterial infections.5 Our
results may have been affected by the finding that almost
50% of all episodes did not have an associated Crp level.
For the 81 analyzable episodes, however, emesis was a better predictor of bactermia than Crp >4 mg/dL alone (positive predictive value, 54% vs 32%, respectively). The
group of patients with emesis and Crp >4 mg/dL had an
especially high rate of bacteremia (80%), suggesting that
these 2 parameters together may be particularly useful in
determining the risk for bacteremia. Gram-negative
organisms dominated the group with emesis and elevated

Crp (6 of 8 organisms cultured). It should be noted that,
although the OR was elevated significantly in this group,
the wide CIs indicate substantial instability in the estimate
(OR, 28.0; 95% CI, 3.70-307.45).
In the current study, among pediatric hematologyoncology patients who had fever and a CVC, emesis at
presentation was associated with an approximately 50%
incidence of bacteremia. Patients who had emesis and Crp
>4 mg/dL had an especially high rate of bacteremia. Emesis was more likely to be associated with Gram-negative
bacteremia than Gram-positive bacteremia. The presence
or absence of severe neutropenia was not identified as a
risk factor for bacteremia. Our study also confirmed findings in other reports that certain diagnoses (eg, AML,
BMT) are bacteremic more often when they present with
fever than others and that external catheters are at higher
risk of infection than completely implanted ports.1,4,11,12
The association of vomiting with bacteremia in this population is an additional factor that may be used in conjunction with other clinical and laboratory findings to help
identify children at high risk for bacteremia and in determining initial, empiric antibiotic therapy. Future, prospective studies may define the usefulness of this clinical
sign further by looking at associations of vomiting with
hypotension, height of fever, or admission to an intensive
care unit.
