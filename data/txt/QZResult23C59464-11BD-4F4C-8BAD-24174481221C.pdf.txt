ABSTRACT
In previous work, it is suggested that the excessive amount of fatty acids
transported by FABP5 may facilitate the malignant progression of prostate cancer
cells through a FABP5-PPARg-VEGF signal transduction axis to increase angiogenesis.
To further functionally characterise the FABP5-PPARg-VEGF signal transduction
pathway, we have, in this work, investigated the molecular mechanisms involved
in its tumorigenicity promoting role in prostate cancer. Suppression of PPARg in
highly malignant prostate cancer cells produced a significant reduction (up to 53%)
in their proliferation rate, invasiveness (up to 89%) and anchorage-independent
growth (up to 94%) in vitro. Knockdown of PPARg gene in PC3-M cells by siRNA
significantly reduced the average size of tumours formed in nude mice by 99% and
tumour incidence by 90%, and significantly prolonged the latent period by 3.5 fold.
Results in this study combined with some previous results suggested that FABP5
promoted VEGF expression and angiogenesis through PPARg which was activated
by fatty acids transported by FABP5. Further investigations showed that PPARg
up-regulated VEGF expression through acting with the PPAR-responsive elements
in the promoter region of VEGF gene in prostate cancer cells. Although androgen
can modulate VEGF expression through Sp1/Sp3 binding site on VEGF promoter
in androgen-dependent prostate cancer cells, this route, disappeared as the cells
gradually lost their androgen dependency; was replaced by the FABP5-PPARg-VEGF
signalling pathway. These results suggested that the FABP5-PPARg-VEGF signal
transduction axis, rather than androgen modulated route, may be a more important
novel therapeutic target for angiogenesis-suppression treatment of castration
resistant prostate cancer.

with a higher risk of prostate cancer [1] and high levels
of trans-isomers of oleic and linoleic acids (long chain
fatty acids) in blood are associated with an increased risk
of prostate tumours [2]. Fatty acids are not only sources
of energy in cells, but are also signalling molecules

involved in metabolic regulation. Their regulatory effects
on enzymatic and transcriptional networks can lead to
regulations in gene expression, cell growth and survival
pathways and inflammatory responses [3]. Fatty acid
binding proteins (FABPs) are known as intracellular
chaperons of lipids. They reversibly bind hydrophobic
ligands such as saturated and unsaturated fatty acids with
high affinity and transport them into the cells [4]. FABP5
is a 15 kDa cytosolic protein which belongs to the FABP
family [5]. In addition to the skin, FABP5 is detected in
endothelial cells of placenta, heart, skeletal muscle, small
intestine, renal medulla and in Clara and goblet cells of
lung [6]. Apart from prostate cancer, FABP5 has also been
implicated in malignancies of bladder, pancreas [7, 8],
breast [9] and glioblastoma [10].
Previous studies demonstrated that FABP5 is
overexpressed in malignant prostate and breast cell lines
compared to their benign counterparts and the increased
level of FABP5 can induce metastasis in vivo [11].
Further investigations revealed that metastasis-inducing
activity of FABP5 was achieved by up-regulating VEGF
[12]. Thus suppression of FABP5 expression in a highly
malignant prostate cancer cell line PC3-M significantly
reduced their invasiveness in vitro [13] and inhibited their
tumorigenicity in vivo by reducing the level of VEGF
and microvessel densities. In contrast, increasing FABP5
expression in the weakly malignant prostate cancer cell
line LNCaP promoted their invasiveness and proliferation
rate in vitro and increased their tumorigenicity in vivo [14].
Higher levels of both nuclear and cytoplasmic FABP5 in
prostate carcinoma tissues are significantly associated with
a reduced patient survival [15]. Recently, it was established
that cancer promoting activity of FABP5 is closely related
to its ability to bind and transport extracellular fatty acids
to their nuclear receptors in prostate cancer cells [14].
Fatty acid receptors termed peroxisome proliferatoractivated receptors (PPARs) belong to the nuclear hormone
receptor superfamily of ligand-inducible transcription
factors [16]. All three isotypes (PPARα, PPARβ/δ and
PPARγ) have been shown to modulate lipid metabolism
[17]. The important role of PPARs in carcinogenesis was
highlighted by the ability of their ligands to affect cellular
proliferation and differentiation or to interfere in apoptosis
and angiogenesis. While different subtypes of PPARs may
have effect on tumorigencity of different cancer types,
high level of expression of PPARγ has been detected in
prostate cancer and cancers of some other organs [18,
19]. Although it has been suggested that the increased
FABP5 may interact with the increased level of PPARγ
in a coordinated way to facilitate malignant progression
of prostate cancer cells [20], the exact role of PPARγ
in tumorigenicity of prostate cancer is not clear. Large
amount of fatty acids transported by FABP5 can stimulate
PPARγ [14], but how the activated PPARγ can increase
the level of VEGF is not known. PPARs can regulate gene
expression by binding to the PPAR responsive elements
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

(PPRE) within the enhancer or promoter sites of the target
genes. Although VEGF promoter region does contain
several PPRE sequences, it was not known whether
PPARγ can promote VEGF expression through binding
to the PPREs in its promoter region to activate mRNA
transcription.
In this work, experiments have been performed
to study the molecular mechanisms of how FABP5 (or
fatty acids transported by FABP5) transduces signals that
eventually lead to an involvement in increased VEGF and
facilitated malignant progression of prostate cancer cells
in both androgen-dependent and particularly in androgenindependent subtypes.

RESULTS
Increased PPARγ expression produced by
FABP5 and establishment of PPARγ-suppressed
transfectants
To confirm the effect of FABP5 on PPARγ, wild
type recombinant FABP5 (rFABP5) was used to stimulate
prostate cancer cells. Western blot analysis (Fig. 1A and
Fig. 1C) showed that the rFABP5 stimulation produced
3.15±0.7 fold increase in PPARγ expression in LNCaP
cells (Fig. 1B) and 2.14±032 fold increase in 22RV1 cells
(Fig. 1D). To identify the best PPARγ suppresser, PC3-M
cells were transiently transfected for 24 hours with 3
candidate double-stranded siRNAs and the changes in
PPARγ were measured by Western blot (Fig. 1E). When
the expression level of PPARγ in parental PC3-M cells
was set at 1.0, the relative levels in cells transfected
with siRNA 1, 2 and 3 were 0.68 ± 0.15, 0.25 ± 0.11 and
0.11 ± 0.09, respectively (Fig. 1F), the most significant
reduction (up to 89%) (Student’s t-test, p < 0.001) was
achieved by siRNA-3. Thus siRNA-3 was selected as the
most efficient suppressing sequence to design shRNA for
stable transfection. The shRNA sequence of siRNA-3
was cloned into the psiRNA-h7SKGFPzeo plasmid
and stably transfected into PC3-M cells to knockdown
PPARγ. Western blots of separate cell lines established
from individual colonies of transfectants showed a single
PPARγ band of 57 kDa (Fig. 1G). When the level of
PPARγ in the parental PC3-M cells was set at 1, the level
in scrambled RNA control cells was 0.98 ± 0.11 and in
clones 1-4 was 0.86 ± 0.09, 0.64 ± 0.08, 0.48 ± 0.11 and
0.18 ± 0.06, respectively (Fig. 1H). Thus levels of PPARγ
were significantly suppressed by 14-52% (Student’s t-test,
p = 0.007) in colonies 1-3 and by 82% (Student’s t-test, p
= 0.0008) in clone 4 cells; there was no significant change
in scrambled RNA control transfectants. Thus cell lines
established from clone 3 and clone 4 were selected as
moderately and highly PPARγ-suppressed transfectants
and termed PC3-M-PPARγ-si-M and PC3-M-PPARγ-si-H,
respectively.

to controls. At the end of the 5th day, cell numbers in
PC3-M and scrambled RNA groups reached 262,000
± 14,000 and 283,000 ± 9810, respectively; whereas
in PC3-M-PPARγ-si-H cells and PC3-M-PPARγ-si-M
cells, they were significantly reduced by 53% and 21%
to 134,000 ± 19,040 and 224,000 ± 15,200, respectively
(Student’s t-test, p = 0.009 and p = 0.004). Mean number
of invaded cells in scrambled (control), PC3-M-PPARγsi-M and PC3-M-PPARγ-si-H group was 54 ± 4, 11 ± 2
and 6 ± 1, respectively (Fig. 2E); representing a significant
reductions of 79.7% and 88.91%, respectively (Student’s
t-test, p = 0.0002, p = 0.0003). The number of colonies
produced in soft agar after 4 weeks by control, PC3-MPPARγ-si-M and PC3-M-PPARγ-si-H cells were 756 ± 64,
80 ± 14 and 45 ± 9, respectively (Fig. 2F), representing
significant reductions of 89.5% and 94.1%, respectively
(Student’s t-test, p = 0.0015, p = 0.0012).
To evaluate the effect of PPARγ suppression on
the tumorigenicity of PC3-M cells in vivo, parental and
transfectant cells were injected subcutaneously into
the flanks of nude mice. The median latent period for
the group with PC3-M-PPARγ-si-H cells was 21 days,
significantly longer than those with parental cells [6 days
(range 5-14)] and with PC3-M-PPARγ-si-M cells [11 days
(range 7-19)]. After three weeks, only 1 of 10 (10%) mice
with PC3-M-PPARγ-si-H cells produced a visible tumour,
whereas all mice (100%) with parental cells and 7 out
of 10 (70%) with PC3-M-PPARγ-si-M cells produced
tumours (Table 1A). At the end of this experiment,
average volume of tumours produced by control cells
(250.6 mm3 ± 60) was significantly larger than those
produced by PC3-M-PPARγ-si-M cells (19.5 mm3 ± 14.6)
(Student’s t-test, p = 0.008) and PC3-M-PPARγ-si-H
cells (2 mm3) (p = 0.0009) (Fig. 2D). At autopsy (three
weeks after inoculation), average weight of the tumours
produced by the parental cells was 275 mg ± 105 which
was significantly higher than those produced by PC3-MPPARγ-si-M cells (26.5 mg ± 12.6) (p = 0.002) and PC3M-PPARγ-si-H cells (4 mg) (p = 0.0003). Representative
nude mice from each group, corresponding tumour mass,
H&E and immunohistochemical staining of tumour tissues
are shown in Fig. 2G. In control group, 5 (50%) sections
stained moderately positive and another 5 (50%) sections
stained strongly positive in the nucleus (Table 1B).
Among a total of 7 stained sections from PC3-M-PPARγsi-M group, 2 (29%) stained weakly and 5 (71%) stained
moderately positive in the nucleus. Nuclear expression of
PPARγ in the only tumour produced by PC3-M-PPARγsi-H cells was weakly positive. No significant difference
in cytoplasmic expression of PPARγ in different primary
tumours was detected. Intensity of staining for PPARγ in
tumours produced by PC3-M-PPARγ-si-H cells (Fisher
Exact test, p = 0.002) or PC3-M-PPARγ-si-M cells (p =
0.02) was significantly weaker compare to those produced
by parental cells.

Moderately malignant 22RV1 cells were used
to study the effect of PPARγ and FABP5 on VEGF
expression. Quantitative analysis showed that levels of
FABP5 and PPARγ in PC3-M were respectively 5.4- and
3.2- fold higher than those in 22RV1 (Fig. 3A, 3B, 3C).
To test the role of FABP5 on up-regulation of VEGF
(through PPARγ), 22RV1 cells were treated with PPARγ
synthetic agonist (rosiglitazone, 0.5 μM) or recombinant
(r) FABP5 protein (2 μM) overnight. Western blot analysis
on protein extracts detected two VEGF bands of 19 and
22kDa (representing VEGF121 and VEGF165 isoforms,
respectively) in both untreated and treated cells (Fig. 3D).
When the densitometry measurement level of VEGF in
untreated 22RV1 cells was set at 1, VEGF levels in cells
treated with rosiglitazone and rFABP5 were 1.41 ± 0.12
and 1.36 ± 0.08 (Fig. 3E); significant increment of 41%
and 36% (Student t-test, p = 0.006), respectively. The
increment was based on the intensities of both bands.
Levels of secreted VEGF in conditioned media were
assessed by ELISA (Fig. 3F). The amount of VEGF
secreted by 22RV1 cells without any treatment was 120
± 8.3 pg/ml, while those treated with rosiglitazone (0.5
μM) or rFABP5 (2 μM) were significantly increased to
915 ± 37.8 pg/ml (7.6 times; Student t-test, p = 0.0003)
and 756 ± 25.6 pg/ml (6.3 times; p = 0.0005), respectively.
Angiogenesis in vitro of secreted VEGF from 22RV1
cells was evaluated by the ability to stimulate human
umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) to form tubes
(Fig. 3G). The tube-forming ability of HUVEC were
strongly promoted and well-assembled organizations
formed in those stimulated with media of rosiglitazonetreated cells or rFABP5, similar to a positive control with
10ng/ml recombinant human (rh)VEGF. Conditioned
medium from the untreated 22RV1 cells caused partially
visible sprouting of new capillary tubes. The average
numerical values associated with tube formation showed
a significant increase in cells treated with rosiglitazone (2fold) (Student’s t-test, p = 0.003) or rFABP5 (1.8-fold) ( p
= 0.006) compared to untreated cells.
To investigate whether FABP5 suppression can downregulate VEGF expression through PPARγ, 22RV1 cells
were treated overnight with PPARγ synthetic antagonist
(GW9662) (20 μM) and 2 mutant FABP5 recombinant
proteins (2 μM). These mutant proteins were generated by
a single mutation (sm) or double mutations (dm) to change
1 or 2 of the 3 amino acids respectively in the fatty acidbinding motif of FABP5 [14]. While the fatty acid-binding
capacity of smrFABP5 is partially lost, dmrFABP5 is
almost incapable of binding to fatty acids. When the level
of VEGF in untreated 22RV1 cells was set at 1, levels in
those treated with GW9662, smrFABP5 and dmrFABP5
were 0.47 ± 0.08 (Student t-test, p = 0.005), 0.56 ± 0.08

respectively (Fig. 3E). Although level of VEGF showed a
36% increase after treating with rFABP5, a 31% decrease
was detected after treating with a mixture of rFABP5 and
GW9662. The VEGF level in GW9662 treated cells is
significantly lower than that in cells treated by GW9662
and rFABP5 jointly (Student t-test, p = 0.02). Levels of
secreted VEGF in conditioned media (Fig. 3F) produced by
untreated 22RV1 cells, by cells treated with GW9662 (20
μM), and by rFABP5 alone or a mixture of rFABP5 with
GW9662 were 120 ± 8.3, 96 ± 12.1, 756 ± 25.6 and 105
± 9.6 pg/ml, respectively. Although treatment with rFABP5
alone produced a 6.3-fold increase in secreted VEGF, when
the rFABP5 was combined with GW9662, the level of
secreted VEGF was significantly reduced (Student t-test,
p = 0.0005) to 12.5% below the control. Moreover, the
average numerical values associated with tube formation
showed a significant increase (p = 0.006) in the cells treated
with rFABP5 (1.8-fold); whereas in those cells treated with
combination of rFABP5 and GW9662, a 42% reduction (Fig.
3H) was observed, although it was not significantly different
from their control (Student’s t-test, p = 0.057).

( p = 0.007) and 0.49 ± 0.12 ( p = 0.004), respectively (Fig.
3D, 3E). The amount of VEGF secreted by the cells treated
with GW9662 (20 μM), smrFABP5 and dmrFABP5 (2 μM)
were 96 ± 12.1 pg/ml, 102 ± 18.4 pg/ml and 74 ± 6.2 pg/
ml; significant reductions were produced by GW9662 (20%;
Student’s t-test, p = 0.002), and dmrFABP5 (39%; p =
0.0009) respectively (Fig. 3F), but not by smrFABP5 (15%,
p = 0.1). When tested for in vitro angiogenesis by treatment
with GW9662 or dmrFABP5, HUVEC cells remained
randomly separated without any sign of a formation of a
complex mesh; similar to that of the negative control (cells
treated with normal culture medium) (Fig. 3G). Conditioned
medium of cells treated with smrFABP5 induced only some
visible capillary tubes without any sprouting. The average
numerical values associated with tube formation showed
a prominent (72%) significant reduction in cells treated
with GW9662 or dmrFABP5 in comparison to untreated
22RV1 cells (Student’s t-test, p = 0.01), whereas that for the
smrFABP5 was not (Student’s t-test, p = 0.11). These results
suggest that the fatty acid ligands of FABP5 is responsible
for the increased production of biologically active VEGF in
22RV1 cells.
To study the possible effect of PPARγ inhibition on
counteracting up-regulatory effects of FABP5 on VEGF,
22RV1 cells were treated with PPARγ antagonist GW9662
(20 μM), rFABP5 (2 μM), or a combination of rFABP5
with GW9662, overnight. When the level of VEGF in
untreated 22RV1 cells was set at 1, levels in those treated
with GW9662, rFABP5 and mixture of rFABP5 with
GW9662 were 0.47 ± 0.08, 1.36 ± 0.08 and 0.69 ± 0.04,

the activity of those transfected with WT and treated with
rosiglitazone (0.5μM), rFABP5 (2μM) and rosiglitazone
plus rFABP5 were 4.25 ± 0.12, 4.13 ± 0.22 and 4.36 ±
0.32, respectively. Activity in untreated 22RV1 cells was
2.62 ± 0.26 (Fig. 4F). The luciferase activities in cells
transfected with WT and treated with either rosiglitazone
(Student’s t-test, p = 0.0003), rFABP5 (Student’s t-test,
p = 0.004) or combination of rosiglitazone and rFABP5
(Student’s t-test, p = 0.001) were significantly higher in
comparison to untreated control cells; whereas they were
not significantly different when compared to each other (p

cells transfected with control plasmid was set as 1, activity
in cells transfected with WT was 3.3 ± 0.18. Activities in
PC3-M cells treated with GW9662 (20μM), untreated
PC3-M-3 cells and PC3-M-3 cells treated with GW9662
(20μM) were 2.05 ± 0.24, 2.23 ± 0.21, 1.95 ± 0.19,
respectively (Fig. 4G), all significantly lower (p ≤ 0.001),
whereas these levels were not significantly different when

(PPARγ-suppressed PC3-M cells) were co-transfected
with following 4 reporter constructs: Control plasmid
(pGL3-promoter-only), Wild type (WT) which contains
PPREs, Mutant 1 (M1) which contains the same segment
of DNA as WT except that both PPREs are mutated,
and Mutant 2 (M2) which contains a much shorter DNA
segment without PPREs. All plasmids, the control, WT,
M1 or M2, contain the luciferase coupled promoters
of VEGF gene. When the level of luciferase activity in
22RV1 cells transfected with control plasmid was set as
1 (Fig. 4A), levels in those transfected with WT, M1 and
M2 promoters were 2.62 ± 0.26, 2.41 ± 0.25 and 1.29 ±
0.17, respectively. When the level of luciferase activity in
PC3-M cells transfected with control plasmid was set as 1,
levels in those transfected with WT, M1 and M2 promoters
were 3.3 ± 0.12, 2 ± 0.14 and 1 ± 0.21, respectively. When
the level of luciferase activity in PC3-M-PPARγ-si-H cells
transfected with control plasmid was set as 1, levels in
those transfected with WT, M1 and M2 plasmids were
2.16 ± 0.22, 1.75 ± 0.24 and 0.99 ± 0.23, respectively.
When the level of luciferase activity in PC3-M-3 cells
transfected with control plasmid was set as 1, levels in
those transfected with WT, M1 and M2 promoters were
2.5 ± 0.32, 1.71 ± 0.31 and 0.99 ± 0.2, respectively. In this
set of transfections, only WT and M1 produced significant
increment in luciferase activity.
To investigate further the effect of PPARγ on
VEGF-promoter activity, 22RV1 cells were transfected
with different reporter promoters and treated with
the PPARγ agonist rosiglitazone (0.5μM). Levels of
luciferase activity in 22RV1 cells transfected with WT,
M1 and M2 rose to 4.25 ± 0.35, 2.33 ± 0.50 and 1.42 ±
0.26, respectively (Fig. 4B). Compared to the untreated
control, the luciferase activity in cells transfected with WT
(Student’s t-test, p = 0.0003) and not mutant promoters (p
≥ 0.25) was significantly higher. After treating with the
PPARγ antagonist GW9662 (20μM), levels of luciferase
activity in PC3-M cells transfected with WT, M1 and M2
were reduced to 2.23 ± 0.12, 1.70 ± 0.22 and 1.15 ± 0.32,
respectively over the untreated control, which were similar
to the levels obtained in co-transfected PC3-M-PPARγsi-H cells (Fig. 4C). Only that for WT (Student’s t-test, p
= 0.002) was significantly lower; those for M1 (p = 0.08)
and M2 (p = 0.27) were not. No significant difference was
detected between levels of luciferase in transfected PC3-M
cells treated with GW9662 and that in PC3-M-PPARγsi-H cells (p ≥ 0.22).
To study the effect of FABP5 on VEGF-promoter
activity, cells were treated with rFABP5. Levels of
luciferase activity in 22RV1 cells co-transfected with
WT, M1 and M2 were increased to 4.23 ± 0.41, 2.04 ±
0.32 and 1.26 ± 0.40, respectively. After treating with

Effects of Sp1 (androgen binding site) on
VEGF-promoter activity
To study the possible effect of the androgen binding
site on VEGF-promoter activity, cells were first treated
with the Sp1 inhibitor mithramycin A (0.1μM) and then
transfected with different DNA reporter constructs. When
the luciferase activity in the cells transfected with the
control was set at 1, luciferase activities in androgensensitive 22RV1 cells transfected with WT, M1 and M2
were 1.73 ± 0.11, 1.19 ± 0.24 and 0.97 ± 0.31, respectively
(Fig. 5A). Thus, after treatment with mithramycin A the
luciferase activity in cells transfected with WT (Student’s
t-test, p = 0.007) and M1 promoters were significantly
lower (Student’s t-test p = 0.001) than the untreated
conrol; but not in cells transfected with M2 (p ≥ 0.1).
After treating with mithramycin A, luciferase activities in
androgen-independent PC3-M cells transfected with WT,
M1 and M2 promoters were 3.2 ± 0.23, 1.7 ± 0.11, 0.95 ±
0.25, respectively (Fig. 5B), none were significantly lower
than the untreated control (p ≥ 0.06).

VEGF and angiogenesis. These results suggest that the
up-regulation of VEGF was produced by the increased
cellular uptake of fatty acids transported by FABP5.
When the ability of binding to and transporting fatty acids
was lost, dmrFABP5 was not only incapable of inducing
VEGF, it may also competitively inter-react with the fatty
acid receptor to prevent FABP5 delivering fatty acids
to their nuclear receptors and thus cannot initiate the
down-stream cancer-promoting gene activity. This result
suggested that dmrFABP5 can act as a suppressor to the
tumorigenicity-promoting activity of FABP5 and PPARγ.
Like FABP5, PPARγ agonists can promote the upregulation of VEGF and increase angiogenesis, whereas
PPARγ antagonists can reduce VEGF and suppress
angiogenesis. The suppression of tumorigenicity of
prostate cancer cells by siRNA knocking down of PPARγ
was likely to be achieved through inhibiting the biological
activity of VEGF. In contrast, the result that FABP5
plus PPARγ antagonists could not induce up-regulation
of VEGF expression suggested that FABP5 promoted
VEGF expression and angiogenesis via PPARγ (through
the stimulation of the fatty acids transported by FABP5).
When PPARγ was blocked with its antagonists, it did not
respond to the stimulation signal produced by fatty acids,
even when high level of fatty acids was available.

DISCUSSION
Suppression of PPARγ reduced the
tumorigenicity of prostate cancer cells
When assessing the role of PPARγ in tumorigenicity,
siRNA knockdown rather than antagonist PPARγ was used
to avoid any nonspecific effects [21]. When tested in 3
bioassays that are regarded as important criteria to measure
tumorigenesis and capability of metastasis of cancer cells
in in vitro [22], we showed (Fig. 2) that high levels of
suppression of PPARγ in PC3-M cells (PC3-M-PPARγsi-H) produced significant reductions in cell proliferation
rate, invasiveness, and anchorage-independent growth.
In nude mouse assay, suppression of PPARγ in PC3-M
cells significantly reduced the size of tumours by 99%,
tumour incidence by 90%. When the level of PPARγ was
moderately suppressed in PC3-M cells, their malignant
characteristics in vitro and their tumorigenicity in nude
mice were inhibited, but to a limited degree. Thus the
malignant characteristics are closely related to the level
of PPARγ and that PPARγ played an important role in
tumorigenicity of the prostate cancer cells. Previous
studies showed that suppression of FABP5 in PC3-M
cells significantly reduced the same parameters [13, 23].
Thus combining current results with those of the past
suggested that FABP5 and PPARγ may be functioning in a
coordinated manner to promote the malignant progression
of human prostate cancer cells.

PPARγ upregulated VEGF expression acts via
the PPREs in the VEGF promoter
Although androgen can mediate the upregulation
of VEGF expression in androgen-dependent prostate
cancer cells through the Sp1/Sp3 binding site in the
VEGF core promoter [28], it was not previously known
how PPARγ exactly up-regulated VEGF in prostate cancer
cells. Studies showed that the regulatory effect of PPARγ
ligands on VEGF expression in human endometrial cells
was modulated through PPREs in the promoter region
of the VEGF gene [29]. To investigate whether activated
PPARγ upregulates VEGF and promotes angiogenesis
in prostate cancer cells in a similar way, a luciferase
reporter promoter system was employed. Although the
promoter region of the VEGF gene is relatively long
and contains many sequences of PPREs, the efficiency
in promoting the reporter gene expression generated by
the full length (2274bp) and that produced by a truncated
(790bp) segment of the VEGF promoter region were very
similar [29]. Thus in this study, a truncated DNA segment
containing 2 PPREs, rather than the full-length promoter
region was used to assess whether PPARγ up-regulates
VEGF gene through PPREs in the promoter region.
When WT and the control plasmids were cotransfected into the 22RV1 cells, which expressed low
levels of PPARγ and FABP5, and treated with the PPARγ
agonist rosiglitazone, luciferase activity was significantly
increased from 2.62 to 4.25; whereas in cells transfected
with other constructs which did not contain PPREs, the

FABP5 promotes VEGF through PPARγ in
prostate cancer cells
Increased level of PPARγ in carcinomas can
stimulate angiogenesis through up-regulation VEGF or
other pro-angiogenic factors [24-27]. Increased expression
of FABP5 induced metastasis through up-regulation
of VEGF [12]; while suppression of FABP5 inhibited
tumorigenicity by decreasing VEGF expression [23].
Here, when 22RV1 cells were treated with rosiglitazone
and rFABP5, both the cellular and secreted VEGF was
remarkably increased and which caused great increases in
angiogenic activity of the conditioned media. Conversely,
when 22RV1 cells were treated with GW9662 and
dmrFABP5, VEGF was greatly reduced in both cell
extracts and conditioned media and the angiogenesis
activity was greatly reduced. When the fatty acid-binding
motif in FABP5 was attenuated by mutating 2 of the 3 key
amino acids, it lost the ability of binding or transporting
fatty acids [14]. Here when the cells were stimulated
with dmrFABP5; there was a reduction in the level of

reduction can be achieved by further treatment with
PPARγ antagonist. These results taken together confirm
both FABP5 and PPARγ are involved in an identical
signalling pathway which regulates VEGF promoter
activity in prostate cancer cells, as proposed schematically
in Fig. 6A.

luciferase activity was not remarkably changed (Fig.
4B). Similarly, when the co-transfected highly malignant
PC3-M cells, which expressed high levels of both PPARγ
and FABP5, were treated with a PPARγ antagonist
GW9662, the luciferase activity was remarkably reduced
to that in M1 transfectants or in PPARγ-suppressed cells
(PC3-M-PPARγ-si-H) (Fig. 4C).These results showed that
the increased level of PPARγ and the presence of PPREs
are essential for VEGF expression in prostate cancer
cells and suggested that it was the interaction between
PPARγ and the PPREs in the VEGF promoter region that
upregulated the VEGF expression.
When the co-transfected 22RV1 cells (with control
plasmid and WT, M1 and M2, respectively) are treated
with rFABP5, the level of luciferase activity of the WT
promoter transfectants is increased by 62%, and no
increase was observed in either M1 or M2 transfectants
(Fig. 4D). This result suggests that FABP5 can promote
VEGF expression only in the presence of PPREs. When
the same transfectants are treated with the mutant FABP5
which is incapable of binding fatty acids, no increment
is observed in any of the 3 transfectants. This result
suggested that it is the fatty acids transported by FABP5
that activate PPARγ and upregulate VEGF through
PPREs. This is further confirmed by the result that when
expression of FABP5 is knocked down (PC3-M-3 cells),
the luciferase activity is reduced by 35% compared to the
co-transfected PC3-M cells (Fig. 4E).
After treating 22RV1 co-transfectants (transfected
with WT) with PPARγ agonist (rosiglitazone) and
rFABP5, the luciferase activity was increased by 62% and
57%, respectively; while subjecting them to a combination
of both treatments can only raise the luciferase activity
to a similar level of 66% (Student’s t-test, p ≥ 0.17) (Fig.
4F). This result suggested that in 22RV1 cells expressing
low levels of PPARγ and FABP5, both rosiglaitazone
and rFABP5 can effectively increase VEGF expression
by the same pathway. In contrast, luciferase activities in
PC3-M co-transfectants (transfected with WT) treated
with PPARγ antagonist (GW9662), the untreated PC3M-PPARγ-si-H co-transfectants (transfected with WT)
and PC3-M-3 co-transfectants (transfected with WT)
are reduced by 32.5%, 35% and 34%, respectively (Fig.
4G). This result suggests that in PC3-M transfectant cells,
which expressed high levels of both PPARγ and FABP5,
suppressing the biological activity of PPARγ by either
its antagonist or knocking down its mRNA by RNAi (as
seen in PC3-M-PPARγ-si-H cells) can reduce the level of
VEGF expression. Furthermore, suppression of FABP5
expression in PC3-M cells can also reduce the level of
VEGF (as seen in PC3-M-3). The difference between
the level of luciferase activity in the untreated FABP5knockdown PC3-M-3 cells and that in the cells treated
with PPARγ antagonist is not significantly (Student’s
t-test, p = 0.25). This result indicates that when VEGF
was already reduced by suppressing FABP5, little further

Androgen- and FABP5-PPARγ-pathways
for modulating VEGF expression and their
relationship with androgen-dependency of the
cancer cells
When 22RV1 cells are co-transfected with different
luciferase constructs, the increase in VEGF expression
produced by WT was similar to that produced by M1
which does not contain PPRE. Thus these increases cannot
have been produced via the PPREs, but rather there are
some other elements in the promoter region of the VEGF
which are involved in up-regulating VEGF expression
in 22RV1 cells. When PC3-M, PC3-M-PPARγ-si-H and
PC3-M-3 cells were transfected with different constructs,
both WT and M1 produced increases in luciferase activity.
This result further confirmed that there are some other
elements rather than PPREs that can stimulate VEGF
expression in the highly malignant PC3-M cells (Fig. 4A).
Another possible important mechanism involved is
the Sp1/Sp3 binding sites and their regulatory effect on
VEGF activity has been shown in some other cancers,
such as the up-regulation of VEGF by oestrogen in breast
cancer cells via the Sp1/Sp3 transcription sites in the core
VEGF promoter [31]. Similarly, androgen may mediate
VEGF up-regulation in ADPC cells via Sp1/Sp3 binding
sites [28]. In this work, after the 22RV1 cells were cotransfected with WT plus GW9662 and mithramycin A,
luciferase activity was significantly reduced by 21% and
34%, respectively (Fig. 5C). These results indicate that in
androgen responsive 22RV1 cells, both the FABP5-PPARγ
and the androgen-Sp1 pathways may play important
roles in up-regulating VEGF expression, although the
androgen-Sp1 route appeared to be more active than
the FABP5-PPARγ route. In contrast, when PC3-M cotransfectants (with WT) are treated with Sp1 inhibitor,
luciferase activity was hardly reduced (Fig. 5B), whilst
a significant reduction is achieved by GW9662 (Fig. 4C).
These results suggest that in castration resistant PC3-M
cells, the androgen-Sp1 pathway is no longer active in upregulating VEGF and the extremely high level of VEGF is
caused mainly through the FABP5-PPARγ route. This can
be illustrated in Fig. 6B.
The androgen receptor (AR) plays a key role in
prostate cancer carcinogenesis [32-34] and prostate
cancer cells are generally sensitive to the initial androgen
blockade treatment. But the cancer relapses afterwards
with a more aggressive form, named castration-resistant
prostate cancer (CRPC). CRPC does not depend on
androgen anymore, but continuation of the androgen

blockade therapy was still widely used to suppress CRPC
[35, 36]. The molecular pathology involved in how
androgen-dependent cancer cells are transformed to CRPC
cells is not fully understood. Currently several mechanisms

have been hypothesized [20]; the most common one is
the AR sensitivity amplification theory [37, 38] which
proposed that when deprived of androgen supply in the
initial round of therapy, some cells try to maximise their

Figure 6: Schematic illustrations of how up-regulated VEGF and its biological activity promote tumorigenicity and
how VEGF is upregulated through 2 different routes in prostate cancer cells. A. Schematic illustration of “FABP5 (fatty

acids)-PPARγ-VEGF” transduction axis. Through this pathway, fatty acids transported by FABP5 can activate PPARγ which ultimately
upregulate VEGF. VEGF is a potent antigenic factor which can bind to its receptor VEGFR1 to promote formation of vessel networks
that are essential for growth and expansion of the cancer cells. VEGF can also promote directly malignancy of the cancer cells through an
autocrine mechanism to simulate the receptor that is highly expressed on the surface of the prostate cancer cells (VEGFR-2) (GonzalezMoreno et al, 2010). B. Schematic illustration of inter-relationship between androgen-Sp1/Sp3 (sugars) and FABP5 (fatty acids)- PPARγ
signaling routes in up-regulating VEGF in androgen-dependent and androgen-independent prostate cancer cells. The results in this study
suggested that in the early stage of prostate cancer, when the cancer cells are still responsive to androgen stimulation, the androgen-Sp1
pathway plays a dominant role in promoting VEGF expression. As the cancer cells gradually reduce their dependency on androgen supply
and ultimately lose their responsive to androgen, the role of androgen-Sp1 pathway is gradually reduced and ultimately disappeared in
AR-negative or androgen independent cancer cells. Opposite to this androgen-Sp1 pathway, the activity of FABP5-PPARγ-VEGF pathway
in low malignant and androgen dependent cells (with low level of FABP5) is very low. But its activity is increased steadily as the increasing
level of FABP5 and the malignancy of the cells and becomes dominant in CRPC cells.

survival ability by increasing the sensitivity of AR to make
use of the small amount of reduced androgen which has
escaped from the blockade. Thus some surviving cells
with an increased ability of using microquantities of
androgen become dominant and CRPC [39]. Some studies
also suggested that mutations in AR gene can increase
sensitivity to androgen [40]. Although each current theory
can explain certain aspects of this pathological process,
no single theory can satisfactorily explain all aspects. For
example, if the AR amplification theory is correct, then
re-expression of AR in AR-negative and highly malignant
cells should increase the malignancy, but studies showed
that the forced re-expression of AR in PC3 actually
reduced the malignancy of such cells [41].
Based on the results of this and other studies, the
following alternative hypothesis is proposed to explain the
molecular mechanism involved in the crucial transition of
cancer cells from androgen-dependent to an androgenindependent state: When the cancer cells are deprived of
androgen supply, most of them die due to starvation, but
some of them may have survived under the heavy selection
pressure by switching their reliance on sugar (or glucose)
uptake (regulated by androgen) [42] to fatty acid uptake
(transported by FABP5) as an alternative energy source
(so-called CRPCs). Although these cells can still use
androgen, and further androgen blockade will kill some
more cells, it can also make some other cells become even
more resistant to androgen deprivation and increasing fatty
acid intake; eventually, completely relying on fatty acids
as their energy source. The consequence of the increased
demand of fatty acids and hence the high level of FABP5
during this process is that the FABP5-PPARγ-VEGF axis
gradually increases its functional activity and eventually
replaces the androgen-Sp1/Sp3-VEGF pathway to
become the dominant route to promote further malignant
progression. Consequentially, prostate cancer cells will
ultimately become totally androgen-independent after their
androgen supply is repeatedly blocked. This can explain
why androgen blockage can lead to a therapeutic dead end
[43]. Based on this alternative hypothesis, disrupting the
FABP5-PPARγ-VEGF signalling axis and cutting off the
alternative energy supply of the cancer cells, rather than
blocking the last drop of androgen, should be the correct
way to kill the AR-negative CRPC cells.

(5000 cells/well). After 4 weeks incubation, colonies were
stained with 0.5 ml MTT (5 mg/ml, Sigma-Aldrich) for
4 hours. Colonies larger than 150μm were counted using
an Optronix Gel Count (Oxford Optronix, UK).

Tumorigenicity assay
The tumorigenicity of transfectants was tested by
inoculating different cells in to male Balb/c 6-8 week old
nude mice (Charles River Laboratories, UK). Cells (1×106)
suspended in 200μl PBS were injected subcutaneously
into the flank of each mouse. Sizes of tumours were
measured twice a week using callipers. Tumour volumes
were calculated by the L×W×H×0.5236 formula [46] and
all tumours were weighed at autopsy (3 weeks after the
inoculation). The work was conducted under UKCCCR
guidelines (HO Licence PPL 40/3578).

Angiogenesis assay in vitro
Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC)
were used to evaluate the tube forming ability of
endothelial cells induced by secreted VEGF in conditioned
medium. Fifty μl ECMatrixTM Gel (In Vitro Angiogenesis
Assay Kit, Merck Millipore) were loaded in each well
of a 96-well plate and the HUVECs (104cells/100μl)
were seeded on the top of ECMatrix layer in each well.
Then 100μl of conditioned medium from each different
treatment was loaded and the plates were incubated at
37°C, 5% (v/v) CO2 for 6 hours. Recombinant human
VEGF (10ng/ml) was used as positive control and each
sample was loaded in triplicate. The cell-tubes were
visualized by adding 50μl of 2% MTT for 10 minutes at
room temperature and quantified under an inverted light
microscope at 40 × magnification.

Immunohistochemical staining
Histological sections (4μm) were cut from
formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded primary tumors [47]
that were removed by dissection, incubated at 37°C
overnight, deparaffinised with xylene and stained with
haematoxylin and eosin with an automated Varistain
24-4 machine (Thermo Scientific, USA). The antibodies
against FABP5 (Hycult, Netherlands), PPARγ (Santa
Cruz, USA) and VEGF (Thermo Scientific, USA)
were purchased commercially and the procedures for
immunohistochemical staining were similar to those used
previously [20].

Dual-luciferase®reporter (DLR™) assay
Three DNA segments based on human VEGF
promoter sequence [49] (gi|224589818:4372794543737944 Homo sapiens chromosome 6, GRCh37.
p10 Primary Assembly) were designed and synthesised.
Main truncated promoter-region (WT) contained
5’flanking sequences extending -805 nucleotides from
the transcriptional start site and including two PPREs
(-796 to -790bp and -443 to -437bp) [29]. PPRE
sequence (AGGCCA) [50] in both locations was mutated
(ATGCAT) in the second DNA fragment. In the third DNA
fragment, the sequence was shortened to -393bp and both
PPREs were deleted. These DNA fragments were ligated
into pGL3 Luciferase Reporter Vectors (Promega, WI,
USA) to form 3 reporter constructs named WT, M1 and
M2, respectively. Prostate cancer cell lines were cultured
and then seeded into 24-well plates (5×104cells/well in
1ml medium). Cancer cells were transiently co-transfected
with Renilla luciferase plasmid plus different luciferase
constructs. The luciferase activities were measured using
DLR™ Assay (Promega, WI, USA).

Scoring immunoreactivity
Evaluation of PPARγ immunoreactivity was
performed in high power fields (×400) using a standard
light microscope. Nuclear immunoreactivities were
independently reviewed by two separate observers.
Nuclear staining was first assessed by the number of
stained nuclei to obtain a percentage score which was 1
(≤30%), 2 (31-60%), and 3 (≥61%); then by the intensity
of staining to obtain an intensity score which was 1 (+),
2 (++), or 3 (+++). The final score for nuclear staining
was obtained by multiplying the percentage and intensity
scores. The final nuclear stains, which scored from 1 to
9, were further classified into weakly positive (1-3),
moderately positive (4-6) and strongly positive (7-9), as
described previously [48].

Statistical analysis

VEGF ELISA assay

Student’s t-test was used to evaluate the difference
in means between two groups for proliferation, invasion,
in soft agar, in vitro angiogenesis assay, as well as

22RV1 cells (1×106 cells/well) were seeded in
a 6 well plate and cultured in growth factor-deprived

defined as statistically significant. Correlation between
the PPARγ expression and the sizes of primary tumors
produced in nude mice was assessed by χ2 analysis.
