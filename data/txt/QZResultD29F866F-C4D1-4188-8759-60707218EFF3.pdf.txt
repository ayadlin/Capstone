ABSTRACT
Corticosteroids, such as dexamethasone, are routinely used as palliative care
in neuro-oncology for their anti-inflammatory benefits, however many patients
experience dose limiting side effects caused by glucocorticoid response element
(GRE)-mediated transcription. The purpose of this study was to use a murine
model to investigate a new steroid alternative, vamorolone, which promises to
reduce side effects through dissociating GRE-mediated transcription and NF-кB
-mediated anti-inflammatory actions. To compare vamorolone to dexamethasone in
reducing pro-inflammatory signals in vitro, murine glioma cells were treated with
dexamethasone, vamorolone or vehicle control. Changes in mRNA expression were
assessed using the nanostring inflammatory platform. Furthermore, drug efficacy,
post-treatment behavioral activity and side effects were assessed by treating two
cohorts of brain tumor bearing mice with dexamethasone, vamorolone, or vehicle
control. Our investigation showed that treatment with vamorolone resulted in a
reduction of pro-inflammatory signals in tumor cells in vitro similar to treatment
with dexamethasone. Treatment with vamorolone resulted in a better safety profile in
comparison to dexamethasone treatment. Vamorolone- treated mice showed similar
or better activity and survival when compared to dexamethasone-treated mice.
Our data indicate vamorolone is a potential steroid-sparing alternative for treating
patients with brain tumors.

INTRODUCTION

treated with high dose corticosteroids. Dexamethasone
is the treatment of choice due to its relatively long
half-life, low mineralocorticoid potency, and low Cushing
threshold [3, 4]. By decreasing intracranial mass effect,
corticosteroids diminish fatigue, headaches, cranial nerve
palsies, weakness, ataxia and spasticity, thereby improving
a patient’s neurological function, activity and comfort [5].
The mechanism of dexamethasone’s anti-inflammatory

Survival rates of CNS cancers have increased as a
result of advances in surgical and medical treatments and
there is increased attention towards minimizing adverse
treatment effects and long term sequelae [1]. Edema and
intracranial pressure caused by the tumor are major causes
of morbidity in patients with brain cancers [2] and are

action is believed to be through modulating of expression
of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), thus
controlling tumor vascularity, and antagonizing
prostaglandins secreted by microglia and astrocytes [6].
Glucocorticoid-mediated efficacy has also been attributed
to transrepressive mechanisms such as inhibition of
NF-кB, a pro-inflammatory transcription factor shown
to promote genetic instability and aid in the proliferation
and survival of malignant cells, promote angiogenesis and
metastasis, subvert adaptive immunity, and alter responses
to chemotherapeutic agents [7–10]. NF-κB response is a
hallmark of inflammation and has been shown to result
in a negative prognosis for patients diagnosed with
glioma [11]. IL10, IL6 and TNF are proinflammatory
cytokines in the NF-κB pathway, and are released during
tissue injury. Furthermore, the role of NF-кB in increasing
the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines including
IL10, IL16 and TNF has been previously described in
cerebral ischemia [12, 13].
Unfortunately treatment with corticosteroids is
associated with severe long-term side effects including
a cushingoid appearance which distorts the patient’s
face and body, generalized edema which can result in
splitting of the skin with open sores, immunosuppression,
mood change, hyperphagia, insomnia, hypertension,
hyperglycemia, and muscle weakness, as well as long term
adverse sequelae like osteopenia and stunted growth [14].
These side effects diminish comfort and quality of life and
are often dose-limiting. It is widely believed that these
glucocorticoid-mediated side effects are attributed to the
transactivation sub-activity in which the glucocorticoid
receptor/ligand complex binds to glucocorticoid
responsive elements (GREs) in the promoter regions of
target genes where they affect gene transcription.
ReveraGen BioPharma Inc. (Rockville, MD) has
developed a novel anti-inflammatory drug, vamorolone,
which is structurally related to glucocorticoids. It has
been optimized for retention of transrepressive activities
(i.e. NF-κB inhibition) and loss of transactivation activities
(GRE-mediated transcriptional activities) [15, 16]. The
potent anti-inflammatory action and reduced side effect
profile of vamorolone has been demonstrated in in-vitro
and in-vivo models of muscular dystrophy[15], allergic
lung inflammation [17], multiple sclerosis [18], and
inflammatory bowel disease [19].
We tested the effects of vamorolone and
dexamethasone in vitro and in vivo using primary brain
tumor cells and murine models. The aims of the study
were to evaluate the anti-inflammatory mechanism of
action of dexamethasone and vamorolone, in vitro, and
to compare efficacy and side effects of the two agents
in mouse models of brain tumors. We hypothesized
that both agents would suppress expression of NF-κB
-regulated cytokines in vitro and that the agents would
have similar efficacy, with vamorolone showing reduced
side effects.

Vamorolone treatment in vitro reduces NF-кBmediated cytokine expression
To assess the role of vamorolone and dexamethasone
on cytokine expression in vitro, murine glioma
cells [20] were treated with vamorolone, dexamethasone,
and DMSO (vehicle control) for 6, 12, 18 and 22 hours,
as described in the Methods. mRNA expression profiling
revealed reduced levels of all 3 cytokines after 12 hours
of treatment with both dexamethasone and vamorolone
(Supplementary Figure S1).

In vivo treatment with vamorolone results in
reduced glucocorticoid-mediated side-effects
when compared to dexamethasone
Tumor developing mice were treated with
vamorolone, dexamethasone or vehicle control to assess
the known side effects of steroids which include stunted
growth, reduced bone growth and immunotoxicity.
Mice treated with dexamethasone were significantly
shorter (8.9 ± 0.4 cm) than mice treated with vehicle
control (cherry syrup) (10.1 ± 0.3 cm) (Figure 1A,
Supplementary Table S1). However, mice treated with
vamorolone did not exhibit the stunted growth, when
compared to vehicle- treated and dexamethasone treated
mice (Figure 1B). Indeed, tibia length measurements
confirmed this finding (Figure 1B). Vehicle-treated mice
had tibia lengths of 2.2 ± 0.1 cm, while in comparison,
dexamethasone treated mice exhibited significantly shorter
tibia length (1.6 ± 0 .1 cm, p < 0.001). In all, vamorolone
treated mice showed tibia length measures similar to the
vehicle control treated mice (Figure 1B).
Steroid treatment also results in immunotoxic
side effects, further complicating treatment modalities
of childhood cancers. To assess the effect of steroid
treatment on the systemic immune function in vivo, gross
examination of the spleen was performed. Treatment with
either vamorolone or dexamethasone resulted in significant
reduced spleen length (Figure 2A, Supplementary
Table S1) and weight (Figure 2B, Supplementary Table S1)
while, dexamethasone-treated mice showed significantly
smaller spleen sizes (1.1 ± 0.2, p < 0.001) and mass
(0.03 ± 0.01, p = 0.001) when compared to vamorolone.

Vamorolone increases physical activity of tumor
bearing mice
Tumor bearing mice (Cohort-2 under Methods,
were assessed for behavioral activity using VersaMax
open field activity measuring system (Supplementary
Table S2). For these experiments, mice were injected
with murine glioma PKC-L cells and allowed for tumor
formation as assessed by live imaging (Figure 3A). Two

weeks post tumor cell injection, mice were treated with
dexamethasone, vamorolone and vehicle control for five
weeks. All treatment groups showed consistent decreased
activity due to tumor formation (Supplementary Table S3).
However, both dexamethasone and vamorolone treatment
resulted in an increase in activity compared to vehicletreated tumor bearing mice (Figure 3B). This cohort of
mice was further monitored for survival. Our analysis
indicated a significantly (p = 0.025) increased median
survival time of mice treated with vamorolone when
compared to mice treated with dexamethasone or vehicle
control (Figure 4A). Tumor formation in all mice in this
cohort was validated by histological staining of brain at
necropsy, indicating the presence of highly infiltrating
tumors (Figure 4B).

Development of therapeutics that enhance the
palliative care of patients with CNS malignancies is
important for effective treatment. Many patients with CNS
cancers respond well initially to steroid treatment, used to
diminish fatigue, pain, and focal neurologic deficits caused
by tumor-related edema and intracranial mass effect
[21, 22]. However, the debilitating side effects of steroid
treatment frequently counteract the goal of improved
quality of life. Adverse side effects may be dose-limiting,
with a recent survey by the European Society for Pediatric
Oncology (SIOPE) DIPG network reporting a toxicity
incidence of 85%. In patients with terminal illness, this
tragically eliminates the option of an oral medication to

effectively manage pain and fatigue, and increase physical
function. Steroid side effects are also associated with long
term adverse sequelae in survivors. Therefore, there is a
dire need to develop alternative anti-inflammatory drugs
that penetrate the CNS and provide steroid efficacy
without the severe side effects.
The exact molecular pathways influenced by
steroids are not well understood, and clinical trials
were never conducted prior to the routine clinical use
in pediatric cancer. However previous studies have
elucidated the mechanisms of glucocorticoid-mediated
efficacy via transrepressive mechanisms such as inhibition
of the NF-кB, and led to development of dissociative
steroids [15–18]. Vamorolone is a novel steroid analogue
that has shown efficacy in inducing an anti-inflammatory
response in animal models of asthma, multiple sclerosis,

inflammatory bowel disease, and muscular dystrophies,
and has shown fewer side effects. We now demonstrate
that vamorolone treatment results in reduced inflammatory
signals in vitro and has efficacy in vivo in brain tumor
murine model.
In our experiments, vamorolone was capable of
reducing NF-κB pathway inflammatory cytokines in
mouse primary DIPG cells and we plan on conducting
dose response experiments in future studies to assess the
drug-target effects. In terms of efficacy, treatment with
vamorolone was associated with increases in physical
activity, possibly associated with less tumor burden,
and there was a 19% increase in survival of mice treated
with vamorolone relative to dexamethasone and vehicle
control mice. Furthermore, vamorolone showed a
reduced side effect profile compared to dexamethasone

Figure 2: Vamorolone is less immunotoxic compared to dexamethasone. Mice were treated with vehicle, dexamethasone or

vamorolone and spleen was analyzed for size and weight. Dexamethasone significantly reduced the spleen size (A) and weight (B) in tumor

when compared to vamorolone or vehicle- treated mice. One-way Anova, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001.

in brain tumor-bearing mice which grew tumors as pups.
Our data therefore indicate vamorolone as a potential
suitable steroid alternative for symptoms caused by CNS
tumor-related edema.
The study had several limitations: we are unable to
determine if the effects seen as a result of the nanostring
experiment, which measures mRNA expression, are
transcriptional or post protein. Attempts to confirm this
data with ELISA resulted in much variation and lacked
sensitivity to validate the findings. The precise mechanism
of dexamethasone in reducing CNS edema and cellular
damage is unknown, with possibilities including working
via the inflammasome, i.e. Na+ and water movement and
intracellular Na+/K+ normalization, or alternatives to
stabilize the blood-brain and blood-nerve barrier. This
study was not designed to evaluate these actions in vitro.
In vivo study conclusions are limited by the lack of direct
testing of tumor-related edema, although the measurement
of edema in patient populations is highly variable and
not considered a valid endpoint for clinical trials. An
additional potential limitation is that two different glioma
mouse models were used for the in vivo experiments. We
believed that more robust and relevant pediatric toxicity
data would be generated from the genetically engineered
model in which pups are known to live slightly longer,
whereas behavior and survivor findings would be
more robust in an experiment performed with the most
aggressive mouse model, using adult mice. The study was
strengthened by the fact that both in vitro experiments
were randomized, controlled and blinded.
The demonstration of the anti-inflammatory
mechanism and the positive preclinical profile supports the
need for further evaluation of this drug to treat neurologic
symptoms in primary CNS malignancies. Indeed, our
finding that treatment with vamorolone increases survival
is an unexpected outcome, which requires further
investigation, particularly in diffuse intrinsic pontine
glioma (DIPG), the most lethal childhood brain tumor to
which most children succumb between 8 to 12 months
post diagnosis. Clinical assessment of vamorolone efficacy
in palliative treatment of CNS malignancies in routine
post-operative care and its potential to extend survival of
children with DIPG is warranted.

for in vitro and in vivo studies respectively. BSG cells
were cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium
containing glucose supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum, penicillin and streptomycin. PKC cells were grown
in NeuroCult basal media supplemented with 10% mouse
cell proliferation supplement (Stem cell technologies),
glutamine, penicillin-streptomycin, heparin (2 µg/µl),
rm EGF (20 ng/mL) and rm FGF (1 ng/mL). These cells
were transduced with lentivirus to express luciferase, as
described previously [20]. The cultures were maintained
at 5% CO2 at 37°C.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

In vivo studies using brainstem glioma model
with orthotopic intracranial injections

In vitro treatment study assessing mRNA
expression profiling of cytokines
The purpose of this experiment was to assess
whether vamorolone and dexamethasone alter
inflammation caused by brainstem glioma cells, as
measured by cytokine expression. IL10, IL6 and TNF were
selected for this study because they are proinflammatory
cytokines in the NF-κB pathway, released during tissue
injury. Murine glioma cells [20] were expanded in culture
and treated with Vamorolone, dexamethasone, and DMSO
(vehicle control).
Cells were grown in total media, serum starved for
24 hours and then treated with dexamethasone (20 nM),
vamorolone (10 µM) and DMSO in serum-free media.
Cells were collected 12 hours post treatment. Total RNA
was extracted using Qiagen RNeasy kit (Qiagen, CA).
RNA concentration and integrity was evaluated by Agilent
2100 bioanalyzer. Sample preparation, hybridization
and detection were carried out according to NanoString
manufacturer’s instructions (NanoString technologies,
WA). RNA (100 ng) expression profiling was performed
using the nCounter NanoString Mouse inflammatory
panel, and data were analyzed using the nSolver software
to produce and compare direct counts of mRNA.

In vivo studies
J:Nu and NOD SCID gamma mice were used in
accordance with our protocol approved by Children’s
National Health System IACUC (#292-12-05, #30425).

Murine cells

Experiments assessing dexamethasone and
vamorolone efficacy and toxicity were performed on two
cohorts of mice who underwent orthotopic injections
- P2 pups J:Nu (Cohort-1) for toxicity assessments and
3 week old NOD SCID mice (Cohort-2) mice for efficacy
assessments. The injection site was sterilized and 300,000
live tumor cells in a total volume of 2 µl were injected
into right cortex (2 mm right from midline, 2 mm deep)
using a gastight syringe (Hamilton, Reno, NV) with

The pediatric brainstem glioma murine model was
chosen because this model is known to cause fast-growing
tumors and edema is a major cause of morbidity patients
with brainstem glioma and is treated with high dose
corticosteroids. Adherent mouse brainstem glioma cells
(BSG cells) and PKC (PDGFβ, H3 K27M, P53 loss) cells
derived from genetically engineered mouse brainstem
glioma model, as previously described [23], were used

a 26 gauge needle. Mice in Cohort-1 were injected
with brainstem glioma cells derived from genetically
engineered mouse model as described before [23].
Briefly, the cells were derived from mouse brainstem
tumors that were generated by overexpressing PDGFβ in
combination with Ink4a-ARF loss in the posterior fossa
of neonatal nestin tv-a mice. Mice in Cohort-2 were
injected with PKC-L(luciferase) cells from a similar
model that had p53 loss and Histone 3 mutation, along
with PDGFβ over expression [24]. We have previously
shown that mice injected with these cells develop
infiltrating cranial tumors [20]. Mice were monitored daily
for tumor developing symptoms (like loss of balance,
hydrocephalus). For all in vivo studies technicians were
blinded to treatment conditions [25].

A survival analysis was also performed on Cohort-2 and
the resulting survival curves plotted using the Kaplan
Meier method.

Toxicity assessment

All continuous outcomes were assessed for
normality using a combination of the Shapiro-Wilk
normality test and visual inspection of histograms.
Most measures were analyzed using one-way ANOVA
with post-hoc pair-wise comparisons and p-values were
adjusted multiple comparisons using the Sidak method.
The consecutive day measures for horizontal activity
3 comparison groups were assessed using a repeated
measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) models to test
the hypothesis that there is a significant difference in
assessments between treatment groups (dexamethasone
and vamorolone) and between time points (pre and
post treatment with steroids). The analysis used two
repeated variables, time and day, to evaluate a difference
in assessments by group and by time, and to test for a
difference in assessments with day. Survival was assessed
using a log-rank test to compare overall survival between
the three treatment groups.

Live animal imaging
Two weeks post injection; live imaging was
performed on mice injected with PKC-L cells to assess
the tumor formation. Mice received intraperitoneal
D- luciferin (5 mg/Kg) and 15 minutes later were
anaesthetized with isoflurane. Luciferase was measured
using IVIS imaging system according to manufacturer’s
instructions (Perkin Elmer, MA).

Statistical analysis

The experiment performed on Cohort-1 (P2 pups
J:Nu) aimed to assess the glucocorticoid-mediated side
effect profiles of dexamethasone and vamorolone in
mice growing intracranial tumors. Beginning at eight
days post injection, mice were orally administered
with vamorolone (30 mg/kg), n = 11, dexamethasone
(2.4 mg/kg) n = 7, or vehicle control (cherry syrup
1 mL/kg), n = 11, daily, for 15 weeks following
guidelines for pre-clinical models [25]. The doses were
chosen based on previous studies of vamorolone [15–18]
and dexamethasone dose was calculated using the
equivalent surface area dosage conversion factor [26].
To assess the toxicity of the steroids, mice (Cohort-1)
were sacrificed at the endpoint i.e. when they showed
signs of tumor (eg. lethargy, hunched back and ataxia)
[20]: spleen, brain and tibia were harvested, weighed
(spleen and brain) and measured (spleen and tibia).
Brain was fixed in 10% formalin to generate H&E and
Ki67 staining to assess the tumor.
