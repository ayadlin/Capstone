Abstract
The radioresistance is the key factor to hamper curative effect and survival of
nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients. Nature triptolide (TPL) has been found
to circumvent drug-resistant effect of cancer, but its effect on NPC radioresistance
has been rarely studied. In the present study, the 10 Gy-resistant CNE2 subclones
(CNE2-SR) were used as a NPC radioresistant model. The IC50 of TPL in CNE2 and
CNE2-SR cells was measured by MTT assay, cell cycle was analyzed by flow cytometry,
and protein expression was examined by western blot. Our data showed that TPL
treatment decreased the percentage of viable cells, and IC50 value in CNE2 and CNE2SR cells was 23.6 ± 1.41 nmol/L and 31.2 ± 1.16 nmol/L, respectively. Six Gy was a
moderate dosage of X-ray for CNE2, and 25 nM TPL was close to IC50 value of CNE2
and CNE2-SR. Six Gy X-ray and/or 25 nM TPL significantly inhibited tumor growth
in nude mice. Furthermore, 6 Gy X-ray and/or 25 nM TPL significantly inhibited cell
growth and induced cell apoptosis and M/G2 phase arrest in CNE2 and CNE2-SR cells.
Moreover, TPL treatment significantly inhibited the expression of GRP78 protein in
CNE2 and CNE2-SR cells. These results suggest that TPL may serve as a potential
radiosensitizer agent for NPC treatment.

INTRODUCTION

effect and enhances the anti-tumor effect of 5-fluorouracil
in KB cells [5].
Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a kind of
rare epithelial cancer, but it is one of the most prevalent
malignancies in southern Chinese populations. However, the
clinical outcome and prognosis of NPC remain unsatisfactory.
Radioresistance is the biggest obstacle to achieve long-term
survival. So it is urgent to screen some novel and effective
drugs to treat radioresistant NPC. GRP78 is an ER chaperone
protein and major regulator of the unfolded protein response
(UPR) [6]. The response of GRP78 to drug-induced ER stress
has been well established [6]. GRP78 may be an important
biomarker protein for drug resistance.
The efficacy of TPL in NPC therapy and its
molecular mechanisms have been poorly studied. In
this study, we first examined the IC50 value of TPL in

Increasing incidence and mortality rate of cancers
urge researchers to make great effort on searching
for novel anti-cancer drugs or therapies. Many active
compounds from natural herbs, such as Taxol, have been
demonstrated to have antitumor activity and widely used
in cancer therapy. Triptolide (TPL, molecular formula:
C20H24O6) active components extracted from Chinese
herb Tripterygium wilfordii Hook F (known as Lei
Gong Teng or Thunder of God Vine) were usually used
for rheumatoid arthritis therapy, but they also showed
antitumor activity through inducing tumor cell apoptosis
[1–3]. It has been found that TPL induces cell apoptosis
via inhibiting HSP70 in pancreatic cancer cells [4].

NPC CNE2 and CNE2-SR cells by MTT assay. Then,
we further investigated that the effects of TPL on cell
proliferation, cell cycle and the expression of GRP78 in
both cells.

The viability in CNE2 and CNE2-SR cells was
significantly decreased in a concentration-dependent manner
after treatment with various doses (0.05–500 nM) of TPL
(Figure 2A). Moreover, consistent with MTT assay, the
number of viable cells was gradually decreased along with
the increasing dose of TPL treatment (Figure 2B). There
was no significant difference in the number of viable cells
treated with various doses of TPL between CNE2 and
CNE2-SR (p > 0.01) despite their different radiosensitivity
(Figure 1A– 1E). IC50 value in CNE2 and CNE2-SR cells
was 23.6 ± 1.41 nmol/L and 31.2 ± 1.16 nmol/ L, respectively.
The 25 nM TPL was close to IC50 value of CNE2 and CNE2SR, and 25 nM TPL significantly inhibited tumor growth of
CNE2 and CNE2-SR in vivo (Figure 2D and Figure 2E).

RESULTS
The radioresistant CNE2-SR from the irradiated
CNE2 cells
The 10 Gy dose of X-ray radiation resulted in
95% of cell death in CNE2. After 15 days, the residual
cells formed some clones (> 50 cells in each clone). The
clones were more resistant than the parent CNE2 in vitro
(Figure 1C–1D; Figure 3A) and in vivo (Figure 3D–3E).
Then the clones were isolated and cultured as a radiationresistant sample, CNE2-SR.

of 6 Gy X-ray and 25 nM TPL completely inhibited cell
proliferation in both cell lines in vitro (Figure 3C) and
in vivo (Figure 3D–3E).

Six Gy was a moderate dosage of X-ray for CNE2,
and 25 nM TPL was close to IC50 value in CNE2 and
CNE2-SR. The proliferation of CNE2 and CNE2-SR cells
was monitored at various time intervals after treatment
with 6 Gy X-ray and/or 25 nM TPL. As shown in the
Figure 3, both CNE2 and CNE2-SR cells were sensitive
to 25 nM TPL treatments (Figure 3B), but CNE2-SR cells

nude mice. The combined treatments of 6 Gy X-ray
or/and 25 nM TPL significantly inhibited tumor
growth of the radioresistant CNE2-SR in nude mice

(Figure 3D and 3E). TPL treatment enhanced the antitumor effect of X-ray, and circumvented the resistant

TPL enhances the radiosensitivity of cells and
changes cell cycle transition

Figure 5A). However, the treatment of 6 Gy X-ray in
CNE2-SR significantly promoted the transition from
G2/M to S phase (Figure 4D4; Figure 5A). Moreover, the
combined treatments of 6 Gy X-ray and 25 nM TPL in
CNE2-SR cells further promoted cell cycle transition from
G0/G1 to G2/M phase again (Figure 4D8).

We examined the effect of combined treatments of 6
Gy X-ray and 25 nM TPL on cell apoptosis and cell cycle
analysis by the staining of Hoechst 33258 and Annexin
V-FITC/propidium iodide (PI). As shown in the Figure 4,
the combined treatments of 6 Gy X-ray and 25 nM
TPL significantly induced cell apoptosis in CNE2 and
CNE2-SR cells (Figure 4A–4C). We further found that the
majority of untreated CNE2 and CNE2-SR cells were in
G0/G1 phase(Figure 4D1–2 and Figure 5A). The treatments
of 25 nM TPL or/and 6 Gy significantly promoted cell
cycle transition from G0/G1 to G2/M phase (Figure 4D3,5,7;
Figure 5A) in CNE2 cells, but this effect was not observed
in CNE2-SR cells treated with 6Gy X-ray (Figure 4D4;

TPL inhibits GRP78 protein expression and
colony formation
Since GRP78 is one of important biomarkers
for drug-induced ER stress [6], here we examined the
expression of GRP78 protein. As shown in the Figure 5,
the expression of GRP78 protein in CNE2-SR cells
was significantly higher than that in CNE2 cells, while
25 nM TPL but not 6 Gy X-ray significantly inhibited the

expression of GRP78 protein after individual or combined
treatments (Figure 5B and 5C). Interestingly, the level
of GRP78 protein was negatively correlated with the
proportion of G2/M phase cells (Figure 5A–5C).
Moreover, we examined the colony formation capacity
after 25 mM TPL and/or 6 Gy X-ray treatments (Figure
5D and 5E). Both 6 Gy X-ray and 25 nM TPL treatments
significantly inhibited colony formation in CNE2 and
CNE2-SR cells (Figure 5D and 5E).

Our data showed that TPL decreased the
percentage of viable cells in the radioresistant CNE2SR cells. The combination of TPL and X-ray showed
synergistic effects and circumvented the resistant effect
of X-ray in the nude mice transplanted with CNE2-SR
cells. It has been demonstrated that the cells at G2/M
phase are most sensitive to radiation, and G2/M phase
arrest is one of the major reasons of cell death caused
by anti-tumor drugs and radiosensitive reagents [13].
Significant elevation of GRP78 expression in cancer
cells is linked to a radioresistant cell type [6–7]. GRP78
is known to induce anti-apoptosis, chemoresistance
and radioresistance. GRP78 has been considered as a
potential biomarker for therapy-resistance in multiple
carcinomas [14–15]. Li et al. found that GRP78
enhances the glutamine metabolism and supports cell
survival from glucose deficiency by activating the
β-catenin signaling [14], while GRP78 inhibitor OSU03012/sildenafil could kill brain cancer stem cells [15].
This evidence suggests that the down-regulation of
GRP78 may inhibit cell survival. Here we observed that
the combined treatments of 6 Gy X-ray and 25 nM TPL
could promote cell cycle transition from G0/G1 to G2/M
phase in the radioresistant CNE2-SR cells. Moreover,
the G2 /M phase arrest and cell apoptosis in CNE2-SR
cells accompanied the downregulation of GRP78 protein
expression. Hence, we speculate that the elevated
GRP78 protein may support cell survival and enhance
radioresistance to 6 Gy X-ray radidation in CNE2-SR
cells.

DISCUSSION
The standard combination of radiotherapy and
chemotherapy has improved the efficiency in NPC
patients, but radioresistance is still the common causes
of biggest obstacle in NPC treatment [7–9]. The survival
of irradiated NPC cells is the most common cause for
the relapse and metastasis of NPC. In the present study,
we established radioresistant CNE2-SR subclones from
CNE2 cells by 10 Gy X-ray radiation, which were more
resistant to 6 Gy X-ray radiation compared with original
CNE2 cells. TPL is a natural drug with anticancer efficacy,
and has been used as a good alternative in many cancer
treatments. Early in 1972, Kupchan et al. first reported the
antileukemic effect of TPL [10]. The combination of TPL
and X-ray showed synergistic effects in preclinical animal
models [11]. Jacobson et al. [12] found that TPL inhibits
pancreatic cancer cell proliferation through reducing the
expression of heat shock protein 70. However, the efficacy
of TPL in NPC therapy has not yet been addressed.

TPL has been found to sensitize cancer cells to
apoptosis [16–18]. Moreover, a recent study reported that
the expression of GRP78 in pancreatic cancer cell lines
is downregulated by TPL, leading to cell apoptosis and
autophagy [19]. TPL may provide new insight and knowledge
for future studies in NPC radioresistant field. Radioresistance
is mostly associated with numerous molecular aberrations
that characterize glioblastoma, such as enhanced DNA
damage repair (DDR) and activation of pro-survival
signaling pathways [21]. GRP78 is a critical pro-survival
chaperone involved in ER stress linked to the changes in
ROS balance secondary to irradiation [22]. Consistently,
our results suggest that TPL may trigger apoptosis and
induce G2/M phase arrest via inhibiting GRP78. Thus, TPL
may serve as a potential chemotherapeutic agent and new
radiosensitizer for NPC treatment.

exposed to 25 nM of TPL and/or 6 Gy of X-ray. Cell
growth was monitored by counting cell number at various
time intervals. Three independent experiments performed.

Cell apoptosis and cell cycle analysis by flow
cytometry
2.5 × 106 cells were treated with TPL (25 nM) and/
or X-ray (6 Gy) and harvested after 48 h treatment. Cell
pellets were fixed with ice-cold 70% ethanol in PBS at
–20°C for 1 h and then centrifuged at 1,500 rpm for 5 min.
The pellet was incubated with 0.5% Triton X-100 (Sigma)
and 0.05% RNase (Sigma) in 1 mL PBS at 37°C for
30 min and then centrifuged at 1,500 rpm for 5 min. For
cell cycle analysis, cell pellets were resuspended in 1 mL
PBS containing 40 μg/mL propidium iodide (PI, Sigma)
and incubated for 30 min in dark at room temperature.
For cell apoptosis, cells were washed with 1×PBS (4°C),
incubated with 300 μL 1×Binding Buffer containing 5 μL
Annexin V-FITC and 5 μL with PI for 30 min in dark at
room temperature. Samples were immediately analyzed
by a FAC-Scan flow cytometry (Becton–Dickinson).
The distribution of cell cycle was analyzed using Flow
Jo, CellQuest Pro and the ModiFit software. Three
independent experiments were performed.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
The survival subclones of CNE2 cells to
irradiation
CNE2 cells were seeded at a density of 1.0 × 105 cells
per 6 cm plate and cultured in RPMI-1640 medium
(Gibco BRL) containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine
serum (FBS, HyClone) and 1% antibiotics at 37°C in a
humidified 5% CO2 incubator. After 24 h culture, the cells
were exposed to sublethal 10 Gy dose (300 cGy/min)
of X-ray at room temperature using a linear accelerator
(2100EX, Varian). Fifteen days after treatment, the
residual CNE2 cells were cultured and named for CNE2SR (CNE2 Survival-Residual subclones). CNE2 cells
irradiated with sham were used as a control.

Hoechst 33258 staining of cells
Cells were grown on coverslips in 6-well plate.
The morphology and apoptosis of cells were examined
by staining with cell-permeable DNA dye Hoechst 33258
(Sigma). Briefly, cells were fixed with ice-cold 70%
ethanol in PBS for 30 min after exposure to TPL (25 nM)
and/or X-ray (6 Gy) for 48 h, then stained with 5 mg/mL
cell-permeable DNA dye Hoechst 33258 (Sigma)
dissolved in Hanks’ buffer for 10 min in the dark. Cells
with homogeneously stained nuclei were considered to be
viable, whereas the presence of chromatin condensation
and/or fragmentation was indicative of apoptosis. To
calculate the percentage of apoptotic cells, at least 200 cells
in three different microscopic fields were evaluated.

Cell viability analysis by MTT assay
To evaluate the anticancer effect of TPL on NPC
cell lines, IC50 of TPL in CNE2 and CNE2-SR cells
was examined by 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,
5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Cells were
cultured at 5.0 × 103/well in 96-well plates for 24 h, then
treated with 0.01 mM PBS (control samples) and various
doses (0.05 nM, 0.50 nM, 5 nM, 50 nM, 500 nM and 600 nM,
diluted in culture medium.) of TPL for 48 h. 20 μl of MTT
dye (3 g/L in PBS; Sigma-Aldrich) were added to each well
and incubated for 4 h. The absorbance of each well was read
at 630 nm on an EL310 Microplate Autoreader (Bio-Tek
Instruments). Cell viability was calculated by comparison
of the A630 readings to the control absorbance. Three
independent experiments were conducted. IC50 value of
TPL in CNE2 and CNE2-SR cells was calculated.

Western blot analysis
CNE2 and CNE2-SR cells were seeded at a density
of 8 × 104 cells/well in a 6-well plate and cultured in the
presence of TPL (25 nM) and/or X-ray (6 Gy) for 48 h.
Western blot was carried out as previously described [7].
Briefly, 50 μg of cell lysates were separated by 10% SDSPAGE and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride
membrane. Blots were blocked with 5% nonfat milk for 2 h
at room temperature and then incubated with polyclonal
goat anti-GRP78 antibody (1: 2,000 dilution, Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) at 4°C overnight. The
membranes were washed and incubated with horseradish
peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1: 2000,

Colony formation assay
Radioresistance of cells was measured by
clonogenic survival assay following exposure to
irradiation. The clonogenic survival assay was carried out
as described previously [7, 20]. Briefly, cells were plated
in six-well culture plates and were exposed to 6 Gy X-ray.
After irradiation, the cells were cultured for 15 days and
the number of surviving colonies (defined as a colony
with > 50 cells) was counted. After staining with crystal
violet, cell colonies were counted under a microscope.
The survival fraction was calculated based on the formula:
number of colonies counted/(number of cells plated ×
plating efficiency). Three independent experiments were
performed.
