Human Cancer Cells

Abstract
The RAS/BRAF/MEK/ERK signaling pathway is a central driver in cancer with many BRAF and MEK inhibitors
being evaluated in clinical trials. Identifying noninvasive biomarkers of early pharmacodynamic responses is
important for development of these targeted drugs. As increased aerobic glycolysis is often observed in cancer, we
hypothesized that MEK1/2 (MAP2K1/MAP2K2) inhibitors may reduce lactate levels as detected by magnetic
resonance spectroscopy (MRS), as a metabolic biomarker for the pharmacodynamic response. MRS was used to
monitor intracellular and extracellular levels of lactate in human cancer cells in vitro and in melanoma tumors ex
vivo. In addition, we used 1H MRS and a ﬂuorescent glucose analog to evaluate the effect of MEK inhibition on
glucose uptake. MEK1/2 signaling inhibition reduced extracellular lactate levels in BRAF-dependent cells but not
BRAF-independent cells. The reduction in extracellular lactate in BRAF-driven melanoma cells was timedependent and associated with reduced expression of hexokinase-II driven by c-Myc depletion. Taken together,
these results reveal how MEK1/2 inhibition affects cancer cell metabolism in the context of BRAF oncogene
addiction. Furthermore, they offer a preclinical proof-of-concept for the use of MRS to measure lactate as a
noninvasive metabolic biomarker for pharmacodynamic response to MEK1/2 inhibition in BRAF-driven cancers.

Introduction
Hyperactivated extracellular signal–regulated kinase (ERK)
1/2 signaling occurs in many human cancers due to mutation
or overexpression of components of the RAS/RAF/MEK1/2/
ERK1/2 pathway. For example, BRAF mutation, especially the
V600E variant, has been reported in approximately 50% of
malignant melanomas and 40% of thyroid cancers (www.
sanger.ac.uk/genetics/CGP/cosmic/). Thus, inhibition of
BRAF/MEK1/2 signaling constitutes a key strategy for molecularly targeted cancer treatment (1), and the recent regulatory
approval of the BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib (PLX4032/
RG7204) for BRAF-driven melanoma shows the effectiveness
of this approach. Many MEK1/2-selective inhibitors have also
been described including PD184352 (CI-1040), PD325901,

selumetinib (AZD6244/ARRY-142866), and trametinib
(GSK1120212). PD325901 and selumetinib have shown potent
antitumor activity in preclinical tumor models (2), and selumetinib has recently undergone phase II clinical trials in non–
small cell lung cancer and melanoma (3, 4). Trametinib has
shown clinical activity in BRAF-mutant melanoma (5).
Compared with cytotoxic therapy, RAF/MEK1/2 inhibitors
are predominantly, but not exclusively, cytostatic. In BRAFmutant cells, MEK inhibition can elicit both apoptotic and
cytostatic effects (6). Tumor shrinkage may therefore not
always be apparent in the early stages of treatment, indicating
the need to identify early, and preferably, noninvasive,
response biomarkers to assess target modulation and treatment efﬁcacy.
Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) provides a noninvasive approach for monitoring metabolism. MRS has shown
different metabolic characteristics in tumors versus normal
tissues (e.g., elevated signals from lipids, choline-containing
metabolites, and glycolytic intermediates; ref. 7), which are
altered with chemotherapy and various molecularly targeted
anticancer agents (8, 9).
The increased glycolytic activity of cancer cells under normoxic conditions, known as the "Warburg effect" is characterized by increased glucose uptake and lactate production
(10). This allows fast-growing cancer cells to shunt glycolytic
intermediates into anabolic reactions while the acid produced
aids tumor invasion and stroma destruction (11). Increased
tumor lactate correlates with poor prognosis in some cases of
brain, breast, lung, and liver cancers (12). Furthermore, in
human cervical cancer, high tumor lactate concentration is

correlated with metastasis and decreased survival, whereas
low tumor lactate is associated with increased survival (13).
Glycolysis is also regulated by oncogenic signaling and
glycolytic alterations occur following inhibition of BCRABL (14), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor
(15), and phophoinositide 3-kinase [PI3K (16)]. RAS activation increases glycolysis in rat ﬁbroblasts (17, 18) and the
ERK1/2 transcriptional targets c-Myc and NF-kB (19) upregulate glycolytic enzyme expression (20) and increase glucose transporter expression (21), respectively. Moreover,
human cancer cells harboring oncogenic BRAF exhibit
increased c-Myc expression (22), glucose uptake, and lactate production (23).
Therefore, we hypothesized that inhibition of MEK1/2 could
impact on the levels of lactate formation in human cancer cells
that may be detected by MRS. Here, we test this hypothesis and
(i) assess whether inhibition of MEK1/2 signaling in human
cancer cells alters lactate levels as detected by MRS and (ii)
explore the underlying mechanisms for our observations.
Furthermore, as highly activating BRAF mutations confer
sensitivity to MEK1/2 signaling inhibitors (6), we also assess
the dependency of the observed effects on BRAF mutation
status.
We show that MEK1/2 inhibition decreases lactate levels
exclusively in BRAF-driven cancer cells. This effect, which is
also observed in a BRAF-mutant human melanoma xenograft model, is associated with reduced glucose uptake and
hexokinase-II expression, which is likely mediated by c-Myc
depletion.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines
The cell lines used, their tissue type, and BRAF/RAS status
are shown in Table 1. WM266.4, SKMEL-28, CHL-1, MDAMB231, and HCT116 cells were purchased from American
Type Culture Collection (ATCC; which uses short tandem

repeat proﬁling for cell line authentication). A2058, DO4, and
colo829 cells were donated by R. Kirk (Cancer Research UK
Centre for Cell and Molecular Biology, Institute of Cancer
Research (ICR; London, United Kingdom). HT29, HT55,
DLD1, and RKO were a gift from Dr. P. Clarke, Cancer
Research UK Cancer Therapeutics Unit, ICR (Sutton, Surrey).
The donated cell lines were from ATCC and sequenced inhouse for BRAF mutation status (24). The Ba/F3 murine
hematopoietic cell lines, containing wild-type (WT) or
V600E BRAF, were produced by Dr. S. Whittaker, Cancer
Research UK Centre for Cell and Molecular Biology, ICR.
Cells were preserved and passaged according to ATCC's
protocols for no longer than 3 months and screened monthly
for mycoplasma.
Cell culture
All cell lines were grown and maintained as previously
described (25) in Dulbeccos' Modiﬁed Eagle Medium (DMEM)
except for DO4 and colo829, which were cultured in RPMI.
BRAFWT-expressing Ba/F3 cells were grown in RPMI containing 10% heat-inactivated FBS and 1 ng/mL interleukin (IL)-3.
BRAFV600E-expressing Ba/F3 cells were grown with (BRAFV600Eindependent) or without interleukin (IL)-3 (BRAFV600E-dependent).
Cell culture materials were from Life Technologies. CI-1040
and PD325901 were purchased from the University of Dundee
(Dundee, United Kingdom). Selumetinib was kindly provided
by Dr. P.D. Smith, AstraZeneca.
Inhibition of cell proliferation
Inhibition of proliferation in adherent cells was assessed
using the sulforhodamine B (SRB) assay (26). For Ba/F3 suspension cultures, the CellTiter 96 Aqueous Non-Radioactive
Cell Proliferation (MTS) assay was used according to suppliers'
instructions (Promega). GI50 values were calculated using
GraphPad Prism (v5.01).

MEK1/2 Inhibition Lowers Lactate in BRAF-Driven Cancer Cells

MEK1/2 inhibition
Equipotent concentrations of MEK1/2 inhibitors that
achieved target modulation (reduced ERK1/2 phosphorylation) and approximately 20% to 30% reduction in cell counts
were used. All cell lines were treated with CI-1040 and a
selected subset also treated with PD325901 for comparison
(Supplementary Materials and Methods). Cell counts and
viability were monitored with Vi-CELL Cell Viability Analyzer
(Beckman Coulter). Protein expression analysis was conducted
by Western blotting as previously described (25). Primary and
secondary antibody information is provided in Supplementary
Materials and Methods.
Cell-cycle analysis
Flow cytometry was conducted to analyze cell cycle distributions as previously described (27).

H MRS
Metabolite extraction was conducted by a dual-phase methanol–water–chloroform method (27). The lyophilized aqueous
phase was resuspended in 540 mL D2O containing 0.015% v/w 3(trimethylsilyl) propionic-2,2,3,3-d4 acid (TSP-internal standard). Media (0.8 mL) were collected from control and treated
cells, lyophilized, and resuspended in D2O þ TSP as above. 1H
MRS data were acquired on a Bruker 500 MHz spectrometer at
25 C. Spectral processing and metabolite quantiﬁcation were
conducted as previously described (25).
Colorimetric lactate measurements
WM266.4, A2058, HT29, RKO, colo829, DO4, HT55, and DLD1
cells were grown in 96-well plates and media lactate levels
following a 24-hour treatment with 0.1% DMSO (control) or 1
mmol/L CI-1040 monitored with a colorimetric assay according
to manufacturer's protocol (Cambridge BioSciences). Readings
were corrected for viable cell content measured with the MTS
assay.
Glucose uptake
WM266.4 cells were incubated for 22 hours with CI-1040
followed by 2 hours in 1 mmol/L CI-1040 þ 10 mmol/L 2NBDG ﬂuorescent glucose analogue (Invitrogen). The ﬁnal 2hour incubation was conducted in FBS- and glucose-free
media. Cells were resuspended in 1 mL ice-cold PBS with 1
mg/mL propidium iodide and analyzed at 4 C on a FACSAria
(BD Biosciences) using 488 nm excitation and 530 nm
emission.
Hexokinase inhibition and c-Myc knockdown
To inhibit hexokinase, WM266.4 and CHL-1 cells were
treated for 24 hours with 1 mmol/L of the glucose analogue
2-deoxyglucose (2-DG, Sigma-Aldrich). For c-Myc knockdown, WM266.4 cells were reverse transfected with 2
nmol/L of negative control siRNA (AllStars-target sequence
proprietary) or c-Myc–directed siRNA (target sequence:
CCCAAGGTAGTTATCCTTAAA) for 48 hours in 0.25%
HiPerFect reagent using manufacturer's protocol (Qiagen).
Media samples were analyzed by 1H MRS for lactate as
described above.

Melanoma xenografts
WM266.4 human melanoma cells (5  106) were injected
subcutaneously into the ﬂanks of 20 to 25 g, about 8-week-old
female NCr/Nu nude mice (Charles River), and when tumors
reached about 500 mm3 in size (3–4 weeks later), the mice
were randomized into control- and selumetinib-treated
groups. The control group (560  77 mm3) received water
only, whereas the treated group (560  127 mm3) received 75
mg/kg selumetinib [dose within a previously reported range
(2)] suspended in water twice daily by oral gavage for 3 days.
Tumor volume was measured using calipers and the equation
(length  depth  width)  p/6. Three hours after the last
dose, tumors were excised, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and
stored at 80 C until further processing.
For MRS analysis, tumors were weighed and homogenized in
lysis buffer (for protein analysis, see ref. 25) or ice-cold methanol (for metabolite extraction) at 4 C to minimize degradation and uncontrolled variations due to sample handling.
Animals were treated in accordance with local and national
ethical requirements and with the UK National Cancer
Research Institute (NCRI) Guidelines for the Welfare and Use
of Animals in Cancer Research (28).
Statistical analysis
Two-tailed unpaired Student t test was used for statistical
analysis, with P  0.05 considered to be signiﬁcant. Pearson
correlation analysis was conducted using GraphPad Prism
(v5.01). Results represent the mean  SD.

Results
CI-1040 induces a time-dependent reduction in
extracellular lactate levels in BRAFV600D human
melanoma cells concomitant with reduced p-ERK1/2
signaling and cell cycle arrest
Treatment of BRAFV600D WM266.4 human melanoma cells
with CI-1040 decreased ERK1/2 phosphorylation at 30 minutes to 48 hours, indicating successful MEK1/2 inhibition.
Cyclin D1 and pRB levels decreased from 6 hours up to 48
hours posttreatment (Fig. 1A), whereas p-MEK1/2 levels
remained unchanged. Cell cycle changes were observed 16
to 24 hours following CI-1040 treatment with the majority of
cells in the G1 phase and relatively few in the S and G2–M
phases (Fig. 1B).
Figure 1C shows representative 1H MRS spectra illustrating the effect on extracellular lactate (lactateE) levels in CI1040–treated versus control cells. LactateE was unchanged
up to 6 hours but decreased signiﬁcantly at 16 hours (79% 
3%), 24 hours (76%  4%), and 48 hours (80%  6%) posttreatment relative to controls (Fig. 1D). Thus MEK1/2 inhibition by CI-1040 reduces lactateE in BRAFV600D WM266.4
cells.
Induction of G1 arrest in WM266.4 cells following 24-hour
exposure to 1% to 2% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), as previously
documented in hybridoma B cells (29), had no effects on
lactateE (Supplementary Fig. S1). Furthermore, lactateE was
unchanged following induction of cell cycle arrest in WM266.4
cells with the cytotoxic DNA cross-linking agent and clinically
relevant drug carboplatin (Supplementary Fig. S2). Thus, the

CI-1040–induced decrease in lactateE is not a general antiproliferative or cytotoxic effect.
CI-1040 and PD325901 decrease extracellular lactate
levels in human cancer cells harboring highly active
mutant BRAF
MEK1/2 inhibition with CI-1040 and PD325901 reduced
p-ERK1/2 signaling in BRAFWT HCT116 (colorectal cancer),
BRAFG464V MDA-MB231 (breast cancer), and BRAFV600E
SKMEL-28 (melanoma) cells (Supplementary Fig. S3A) as also
observed in BRAFV600D WM266.4 melanoma cells (Fig. 1A).
p-ERK levels were undetectable in BRAFWT CHL-1 cells.
As with WM266.4 cells, p-MEK1/2 levels remained unaltered
after MEK inhibition in SKMEL-28 cells harboring the highly
active BRAFV600E. In BRAFWT cells and cells with an intermediate activity mutant BRAF (BRAFG464V), p-MEK1/2 levels were
induced post-treatment. The induction of p-MEK1/2 in nonBRAFV600E/V600D cell lines following MEK1/2 inhibition is
consistent with previous reports (30, 31). This effect is a result
of MEK1/2 inhibitor–induced abolition of negative feedback
regulation involving ERK1/2 and RAF proteins that is only
present in BRAF-independent cells (30, 31). Furthermore, SRB
assays indicated that CI-1040 and PD325901 inhibited cell
proliferation with greater potency in BRAF-driven than in
BRAF-independent cell lines (Supplementary Fig. S3B) consistent with previous reports (6).
Flow cytometry showed that CI-1040 and PD325901 induced
cell cycle arrest in SKMEL-28, HCT116, and MDA-MB231 cells
as observed in WM266.4 cells (Supplementary Fig. S3C).

H MRS showed that MEK1/2 inhibition with either CI1040 or PD325901 was associated with decreased intracellular lactate levels (lactateI) in BRAFV600D WM266.4 and
BRAFV600E SKMEL-28 cells (to 31%–47% of controls, Table 2).
LactateI also decreased in MDA-MB231 (BRAFG464V) and
HCT116 (BRAFWT) cells in response to CI-1040 treatment
(to 68%–77% of controls) and in HCT116 cells following

exposure to PD325901 (to 71% of controls) as shown
in Table 2. The extent of reduction was less than that seen
in BRAF-driven cells.
LactateE remained unchanged following CI-1040 treatment in CHL-1, HCT116, and MDA-MB231 cells. Similarly,
PD325901 did not alter lactateE levels in HCT116 cells
(Table 2). Importantly, however, cells harboring an activating BRAF mutation showed signiﬁcantly decreased lactateE
in response to both CI-1040 and PD325901 treatments
(Table 2). In BRAFV600D WM266.4 and BRAFV600E SKMEL-28
cells, lactateE decreased to 69%–82% and 76%–77% respectively,
of controls.
To determine whether the effect on lactateE following
MEK1/2 inhibition was more broadly related to BRAF mutational status, additional cell lines were assessed using a colorimetric assay. This method gave comparable results to 1H
MRS as assessed in WM266.4 cells (Fig. 2A; P ¼ 0.2). As shown
in Fig. 2A, only cancer cells harboring the BRAFV600E/V600D
mutation showed signiﬁcantly reduced lactateE following
MEK1/2 inhibition (n ¼ 3–5, P  0.05).
These data show that following MEK1/2 signaling inhibition,
lactateE decreases exclusively in BRAF-driven human cancer
cell lines.
Dependency on activated BRAF signaling dictates
modulation of extracellular lactate levels following
MEK1/2 inhibition
To conﬁrm that the MEK1/2 inhibitor–induced lactateE
effects were due to the presence of activated BRAF, we used
murine Ba/F3 cells isogenic for BRAF mutation. BRAFWTexpressing Ba/F3 cells depend on IL-3 for growth. This dependency is abolished upon enforced expression of mutant
BRAFV600E, which renders the cells dependent on BRAF for
ERK1/2-driven survival. The addition of IL-3 to BRAFV600Eexpressing Ba/F3 cells, however, abrogates their BRAF dependency (24).

Western blotting showed that baseline p-MEK1/2 levels
were detectable only in BRAFV600E-expressing Ba/F3 cells and
were induced by CI-1040 in all except BRAFV600E-expressing
Ba/F3 cells grown without IL-3 (i.e., BRAFV600E-dependent,
Fig. 2B). Relative to BRAFWT Ba/F3 and BRAFV600E Ba/F3 cells
grown with IL-3, baseline p-ERK1/2 levels were elevated in
BRAFV600E Ba/F3 grown without IL-3 and decreased following
CI-1040 treatment.
CI-1040 induced a reduction in the S and G2–M phases
and an increase in the G1 phase population in both BRAFWT
and BRAFV600E Ba/F3 cells (Fig. 2C), but the extent of the
cell cycle arrest was more profound in BRAFV600E-dependent
Ba/F3 cells.
LactateE was unchanged in CI-1040–treated BRAFWT Ba/F3
cells (Fig. 2D; 94%  1%, P ¼ 0.4). However, in BRAFV600E Ba/F3
cells grown without IL-3, lactateE decreased signiﬁcantly posttreatment with CI-1040 to 67%  7% of controls (P ¼ 0.001).
Importantly, addition of IL-3 to the growth media, which
disrupts the BRAF dependency (24), abrogated the effect on
lactateE that was observed in the absence of IL-3 following CI1040 treatment (98%  6%, P ¼ 0.5).
These data show that it is the dependency of cells on mutant
BRAF that controls the decrease in lactateE following MEK1/2
inhibition.
CI-1040 reduces glucose metabolism in BRAFV600E/V600D
but not BRAFWT human melanoma cells
In cancer cells, the major route for lactate production is
glucose metabolism (12). Concentrating on melanoma
cells, we assessed the effect of CI-1040 on glucose metabolism by monitoring its uptake, using 1H MRS and the
ﬂuorescent glucose analogue 2-NBDG, together with the
expression of hexokinase-I and hexokinase-II using Western blotting.

H MRS showed that CI-1040 reduced glucose uptake in
BRAF-driven WM266.4 but not in BRAF-independent CHL-1
cells (Supplementary Table S1). As shown in Fig. 3A, CI-1040
reduced 2-NBDG uptake to 88%  2% of controls (P ¼ 0.001)
in BRAFV600D WM266.4 cells. These results conﬁrmed that
MEK1/2 inhibition with CI-1040 reduced glucose uptake in
BRAF-dependent WM266.4 cells in agreement with the 1H MRS
ﬁndings.
While hexokinase-I levels were mostly unchanged, hexokinase-II expression was markedly reduced by CI-1040 in BRAFmutant WM266.4, SKMEL-28 and A2058 but not in BRAFWT
CHL-1 or DO4 melanoma cells, correlating positively with
lactateE levels (r ¼ 0.92, P ¼ 0.02; Fig. 3B and C). Similar effects
were observed in BRAFV600E HT29 human colon cancer cells
(Supplementary Fig. S4).
Treatment of WM266.4 cells with varying concentrations of
CI-1040 showed that the decrease in lactateE paralleled the
reduction in hexokinase-II expression, but not cell counts,
following MEK1/2 inhibition (Fig. 3D). Thus, the lactateE
changes are likely to reﬂect hexokinase-II inhibition rather
than drug-induced antiproliferative effects.
The decrease in hexokinase-II expression is consistent with
reduced glucose utilization for the generation of downstream
glycolytic intermediates including pyruvate and consequently
lactate. Indeed, exposure of WM266.4 and CHL-1 cells to the
glycolysis and hexokinase inhibitor 2-DG also decreased
lactateE levels (Fig. 4A).
We also observed a reduction in c-Myc expression in BRAFdriven WM266.4 and SKMEL28 cells but not in BRAFWT CHL-1
or DO4 cells (Fig. 3E). siRNA knockdown of c-Myc expression in
WM266.4 cells reduced hexokinase-II expression as well as
lactateE levels (Fig. 4B). Thus, the decrease in hexokinase-II
expression in BRAF-dependent cells could be mediated by
decreased levels of its transcriptional regulator c-Myc (20)

MEK1/2 inhibition with selumetinib reduces lactate
levels in BRAF-driven melanoma xenografts
WM266.4 melanoma xenografts were used to monitor the in
vivo effects of MEK1/2 inhibition by selumetinib on tumor
lactate. This drug was chosen as it was in clinical testing when
the research was being conducted.
After 3 days of dosing, selumetinib-treated WM266.4 tumors
were not signiﬁcantly different in volume compared with
pre-treatment values (100%  22%, P ¼ 0.98) indicating a
growth arrest. In contrast, vehicle-treated tumors progressed
to 143%  18% (P ¼ 0.002).
Immunoblotting conﬁrmed MEK1/2 inhibition in tumor
xenografts as shown by reduced p-ERK1/2 and pRB expression
(Fig. 5A). 1H MRS of excised tumor tissue revealed a 55%  23%
reduction in lactate concentration in the drug-treated tumors

whose expression is known to be modulated by ERK1/2

These results indicate that the reduction in lactateE
observed after MEK1/2 inhibition is associated with downregulation of glucose metabolism, and particularly hexokinase-II expression, which could result from c-Myc depletion.
This effect was only observed in BRAF-driven melanoma
cells.

relative to controls (P ¼ 0.0001, Fig. 5B). Furthermore, the
ratio of lactate to total metabolites present in the 0.8 to
3.1 ppm spectral range, containing many glycolytic intermediates and amino acids, was also reduced to a similar
level (Fig. 5B). Thus, the decline in lactate content is not
simply a reﬂection of reduced overall metabolite levels or
tissue mass following selumetinib therapy. These results
show that MEK1/2 inhibition reduces lactate levels in
BRAF-driven tumors treated in vivo, in agreement with the
in vitro effects.

Discussion
The BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib has recently gained U.S.
Food and Drug Administration approval for the treatment
of BRAF-driven melanoma (33), and many other BRAF and
MEK1/2 inhibitors are undergoing clinical development
(34).
Earlier studies have shown that oncogenic RAS increases
the glycolytic activity of murine ﬁbroblasts and human cancer
cells (35, 36). The ERK1/2 target c-Myc increases lactate
dehydrogenase (LDH)-A expression and lactate generation in
rat ﬁbroblasts (37), and activation of NF-kB, another ERK1/2
target, in mouse embryonic ﬁbroblasts increases glucose

exhibit enhanced glucose uptake and lactate production (23).
We therefore hypothesized that inhibition of MEK1/2 signaling decreases lactate production in human cancer cells
allowing monitoring of drug effects by MRS.

Furthermore, treatment of WM266.4 with DMSO or the cytotoxic DNA cross-linking agent carboplatin for 24 hours at

signiﬁcant effect on lactateE levels. Thus, the lactateE changes
reported here are not simply due to nonspeciﬁc antiproliferative effects.

signaling inhibition (39). With MEK1/2 inhibitor treatment,
no effects on p-AKT levels were observed in WM266.4 cells
(Supplementary Fig. S5). Hence, the treatment-induced
decrease in lactateE observed here could not be due to
PI3K/AKT inhibition.
LactateE reﬂects the total lactate levels accumulated over
time. In contrast, lactateI represents only 0.05% to 0.15% of
lactateE and is a snapshot of what is present at the time of
metabolite extraction. The reduction in lactateI seen following MEK1/2 inhibition was always more pronounced in
cells containing the oncogenic BRAFV600E/V600D mutants
relative to non–BRAF-driven cells. This suggests that the
BRAF-independent cells are experiencing a less profound
metabolic response to treatment as lactateE remained
unchanged.
To further corroborate this conclusion, lactateE was
analyzed in a larger cancer cell line panel previously
sequenced in-house for BRAF (24). Our data show that
following MEK1/2 inhibition, human cancer cell lines harboring an activating BRAF mutation consistently display a
signiﬁcant decrease in lactateE that is not observed in
BRAFWT cells.
To ascertain whether the differences in metabolic response
were related directly to BRAF dependence, we used isogenic
Ba/F3 cells expressing either BRAFWT or BRAFV600E. The Ba/F3
cells harboring BRAFV600E are driven by BRAF only in the
absence of IL-3. Western blotting showed signaling output
proﬁles following CI-1040 treatment in Ba/F3 cells consistent
with MEK1/2 inhibition under conditions of BRAF dependency
or independency, namely, reduced P-ERK1/2 levels in all cases
and induction of P-MEK1/2 in BRAF-independent cells
only (30).
1
H MRS showed that CI-1040 decreased lactateE signiﬁcantly
in BRAFV600E-driven Ba/F3 cells. Importantly, when the BRAF
dependency was removed by the addition of IL-3, the effect on
lactateE was abolished. LactateE was unchanged in BRAFWTexpressing Ba/F3 cells. These experiments showed that the
reduction in lactateE levels observed following MEK1/2 inhibition is controlled by the dependence of cancer cells on
mutant BRAF.

MEK1/2 Inhibition Lowers Lactate in BRAF-Driven Cancer Cells

The molecular drivers mediating the BRAF dependency of
the lactate response following MEK1/2 inhibition remain
unclear. MEK1/2/ERK1/2 signaling is regulated by cross-talk
from other signaling proteins such as CRAF (40) and AKT (41),
and glycolytic alterations occur with modulation of various
oncogenic signaling effectors (14–16). Whether the differential
lactate response observed here is linked to compensatory
effects from such proteins or from alternative signaling or
metabolic pathways warrants further investigation.
Next we set out to explore the metabolic processes underlying the lactateE effect following MEK1/2 inhibition in human
melanoma cells. The predominant source for lactate production in cancer cells is glucose metabolism. Glucose is taken up
into cells via glucose transporters then phosphorylated via
hexokinase, particularly hexokinase-II, to produce glucose-6phosphate. This is subsequently metabolized via a multistep
process to pyruvate, which is then converted to lactate via LDH
(12). Pyruvate can also be metabolized to other intermediates,
mainly alanine, acetyl-CoA, and oxaloacetate (42). No significant changes in 1H MRS-detectable alanine were observed
in CI-1040–treated BRAFV600D WM266.4 melanoma cells that
could indicate pyruvate–alanine transamination and that
could lead to decreased lactateE (data not shown). Detailed
metabolic ﬂux analysis is required to assess whether the effects
observed here lead to altered ﬂux to oxaloacetate and/or
acetyl-CoA.
We assessed glucose metabolism by measuring its uptake
into cells (using 1H MRS and 2-NBDG) and the expression of
hexokinase-I/II using immunoblotting. MEK1/2 inhibition by
CI-1040 in BRAFV600D WM266.4 cells caused approximately
12% decrease in glucose uptake as measured with 1H MRS and
2-NBDG. More importantly, CI-1040 caused a substantial
reduction in hexokinase-II expression in oncogenic BRAFdriven WM266.4, SKMEL28, and A2058 melanoma cells but
not in BRAF-independent CHL-1 or DO4 melanoma cells,
correlating positively with lactateE levels.
Hexokinase-II is a key glycolytic enzyme that is overexpressed in many human cancers (43). Decreased hexokinase-II expression following MEK inhibition suggests reduced
glycolytic ﬂux to pyruvate leading to a decrease in lactate
formation as previously shown (44). CI-1040 had no signiﬁcant
effect on LDH activity in WM266.4 cells (data not shown),
supporting our conclusion that the effect on lactateE occurs
upstream of pyruvate.
Exposing WM266.4 cells to varying CI-1040 concentrations
showed that the decrease in lactateE mirrored the reduction in
hexokinase-II levels but not cell counts, indicating that lactateE
changes reﬂect hexokinase-II inhibition rather than antiproliferative effects following MEK1/2 blockade. Indeed the hexokinase inhibitor 2-DG was able to reproduce the decrease in
lactateE induced by CI-1040 indicating that inhibition of glucose utilization is a key contributor to the reduction in lactate
production following MEK inhibition in BRAF-driven melanoma cells.
The changes in hexokinase-II expression reported here are
likely to result in reduced 2-deoxy-2 [18F] ﬂuoro-D-glucose
(FDG) uptake (which is inﬂuenced by both tracer uptake and
phosphorylation via hexokinase-II) as reported in a hexoki-

www.aacrjournals.org

nase-II knockdown model (45). Consistent with our ﬁndings,
recent work has shown reduced FDG uptake in vitro and in vivo
post-treatment with the BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib in BRAFdriven human melanoma cells, associated with reduced hexokinase-II expression (46, 47).
CI-1040 also induced depletion of c-Myc in BRAF-mutant
WM266.4 and SKMEL28 but not in BRAFWT CHL-1 or DO4
melanoma cells, and siRNA-mediated knockdown of c-Myc in
WM266.4 cells also led to depletion of hexokinase-II with a
concomitant decrease in lactateE. Thus the decrease in hexokinase-II expression could be caused by depletion of its transcriptional regulator c-Myc (20) following ERK1/2 signaling
inhibition.
In BRAF-WT/NRAS–mutant DO4 cells, and despite reduced
P-ERK1/2 levels following CI-1040 treatment, c-Myc and hexokinase-II expression was not altered, concomitant with no
changes in lactateE. Thus the lactate effects observed are not
simply readouts of MEK blockade but likely reﬂect downstream inhibition of hexokinase-II and possibly also c-Myc.
Taken together, these data show that decreased hexokinaseII expression is a key contributor to the reduction in lactateE in
BRAF-driven melanoma cells following MEK1/2 inhibition,
which could be caused by depletion of the ERK1/2 target cMyc (32). These changes were observed only in BRAF-dependent melanoma cells displaying reduced lactateE. Further work
is required to assess these effects in cell lines from other tissue
types with mutant BRAF- or RAS-driven ERK1/2 signaling and
investigate the impact of MEK inhibition on additional glycolytic enzymes.
Finally, and to assess the translatability of the lactate
changes to in vivo tumor models, we assessed the effects of
the MEK1/2 inhibitor selumetinib on lactate levels in tissue
extracts from BRAFV600D WM266.4 melanoma xenografts. Ex
vivo 1H MRS analysis of tumor tissue showed that concomitant
with decreased ERK1/2 signaling and induction of tumor
stasis, lactate concentration (including both lactateI þ
lactateE) decreased in the selumetinib-treated tumors compared with controls. The ratio of lactate/total metabolites
contained in the 0.8–3.1 ppm spectral region (including various
amino acids and glycolytic intermediates) was also reduced in
the selumetinib-treated tumors relative to controls to a comparable extent to the absolute lactate concentration. Thus, the
decrease in lactate is not simply a reﬂection of reduced overall
tumor and metabolite mass following treatment and constitutes a genuine metabolic effect of MEK1/2 inhibition.
The tumor lactate changes seen in responding tumor xenografts are consistent with our in vitro ﬁndings in BRAFV600E/D
cancer cells. Although it is unclear whether this lactate effect is
functionally important to the antitumor activity of MEK inhibitors, our data highlight the potential of lactate as an in vivo
biomarker of MEK1/2 signaling blockade. Further studies are
required to assess whether changes in lactate following BRAFMEK1/2 targeted therapy can be detected noninvasively using
in vivo MRS in animal tumor models and, more importantly, in
patients.

time pyruvate–lactate exchange in vivo (50) in response to
therapy in preclinical models (9, 51) and, more recently, in
patients with cancer. The possibility of translating our ﬁndings
to clinical MR systems supports the investigation of lactate as a
clinically applicable noninvasive biomarker of MEK1/2 signaling inhibition. This would complement current work using
FDG-positron emission tomography (PET) to investigate metabolic response to BRAF/MEK1/2-targeted therapy in the
clinic (52). MRS assessment of lactate, especially when combined with multiparametric MR imaging of the tumor microenvironment (e.g., cellularity and vascularity), will offer valuable complementary information to FDG-PET. The current
study provides proof of principle for investigating lactate
metabolism using MRS in BRAF/MEK inhibitor–treated
patient tumors.
The observation that downregulation of hexokinase-II and cMyc via alternative approaches also results in an MRS-detectable reduction in lactateE could widen the applicability of
lactate as an imaging biomarker for monitoring the action of
other targeted drugs known to inhibit hexokinase-II, and
potentially also c-Myc, for example, mTOR and PDGF receptor
inhibitors (15, 53).
In summary, we show that selective MEK1/2-targeted therapeutics decrease lactateE levels in human cancer cells. Importantly, by using a panel of human cancer cell lines as well as the
BRAF isogenic Ba/F3 cell model, we show for the ﬁrst time that
this lactateE response is dependent on BRAF oncogene addiction. This effect, which was also observed in tissues from
MEK1/2 inhibitor–treated BRAF-driven human melanoma
xenografts, was time-dependent and correlated with reduced
hexokinase-II expression, which could be caused by c-Myc
depletion. These data provide important new insights into the
cellular consequences of oncogenic BRAF signaling modulation and support the development of lactate as a clinically

applicable noninvasive metabolic imaging biomarker of
MEK1/2-targeted therapeutics in BRAF-driven cancers.
