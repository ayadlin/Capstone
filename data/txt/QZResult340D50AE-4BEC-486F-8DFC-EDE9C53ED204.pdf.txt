Cancer Immunotherapy Using a Bispecific NK Receptor
Fusion Protein that Engages both T Cells and Tumor Cells
Tong Zhang and Charles L. Sentman

Abstract
T-cell immunotherapy is a promising strategy to treat cancer, but its efficacy, complexity, and costs may pose
challenges. In this study, we report the results of an investigation of a new approach to selectively activate a Tcell attack against tumor cells. The immunotherapeutic approach we developed utilizes a bifunctional fusion
protein that binds tumor cells through NK (natural killer)–activating receptor NKG2D and that recruits and
stimulates T cells through an anti-CD3 single-chain variable fragment (scFv-NKG2D). In vitro, this scFv-NKG2D
fusion protein engaged both T cells and tumor cells, stimulating T cells to produce IFN-g, and cytotoxicity
against NKG2D ligand–positive tumor cells. In vivo, expression of scFv-NKG2D by NKG2D ligand–positive tumor
cells reduced tumor burden and, in some cases, led to tumor-free survival. Administration of scFv-NKG2D in vivo
also promoted survival in a murine lymphoma model. Tumor-free mice were resistant to rechallenge with
cognate tumor cells, suggesting that a host-specific immunologic memory response had been generated. Host
adaptive immunity including gd T cells was required for scFv-NKG2D–mediated therapeutic efficacy. ScFvNKG2D also inhibited the growth of NKG2D ligand–negative B16F10 tumors, reduced the percentage of myeloidderived suppressor cells and regulatory T cells, and increased the infiltration of T cells, suggesting that scFvNKG2D may target these immune suppressive cells. Together, these results establish scFv-NKG2D as a promising
biological fusion protein to induce effective antitumor immunity. Cancer Res; 71(6); 2066–76. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
T cells can play an important role in controlling tumor
growth and prolonging survival in cancer patients (1). However, it is difficult to mount and sustain effective tumorspecific T-cell responses due to weak immunogenicity of
tumor antigens, clonal deletion of high-affinity T cells, low
frequency of antigen-specific T cells, downregulation of MHC
molecules, and existence of immune suppressor cells and
tumor-derived immunosuppressive molecules (2–4). Although
adoptive transfer of T cells can partially restore antitumor
immunity, in vitro generation of large numbers of tumorspecific T cells for treatment still remains a difficult task.
Alternatively, T-cell–mediated antitumor immunity can be
achieved using bispecific T-cell engagers, which bind to a
surface target antigen on cancer cells and to CD3 on T cells (5).
This strategy allows T cells to recognize tumor cells and
become activated irrespective of their T-cell receptor speci-

ficity and their activation by antigen-presenting cells. Recent
results from a clinical trial with a CD19/CD3 bispecific antibody showed promise in cancer treatment (5, 6).
Natural killer (NK) cells attack tumor and virally infected
cells in the absence of MHC restriction, utilizing a combination of multiple activating receptors. One of these activating
receptors is NKG2D. The ligands for NKG2D receptor include
Rae1, Mult1, and H60 in mouse, and MICA/B and RAET1, also
called ULBPs (UL-16 binding proteins), in human, which are
preferentially expressed on tumor cells but not on most
normal tissues (7–9). NKG2D ligands represent ideal targets
for immunotherapeutic approaches because they are selectively overexpressed on many types of tumor cells and tumorassociated suppressor cells (10, 11). Therefore, the NKG2D
receptor–NKG2D ligand system provides a relatively specific
system for immune cells to recognize tumor cells and the
tumor microenvironment. In this study, we describe a novel
antitumor strategy based on a bispecific T-cell engager (scFvNKG2D), in which a single-chain variable fragment (scFv) of
anti-CD3e was fused to the extracellular domain of NKG2D
receptor. Our hypothesis was that scFv-NKG2D would bind
NKG2D ligand–positive tumor cells via NKG2D and activate T
cells via anti-CD3e scFv portion, leading to elimination of the
tumor and induction of host antitumor immunity. Because
many types of tumor cells (leukemia, lymphoma, colon, breast,
prostate, and ovarian cancers, among others) and immune
suppressor cells [myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC)
and regulatory T cells (Treg)] express NKG2D ligands
(9–11), scFv-NKG2D targeting provides a means to engage

T cells against multiple types of tumor cells and local tumor
immune suppressor cells.

Materials and Methods
Mice and cell lines
C57BL/6 [B6; wild type (WT)] mice were purchased from
National Cancer Institute (NCI). TCRa/ mice (B6 background) were obtained from Dr. William R. Green (Dartmouth
Medical School). Rag1/ mice (B6 background) were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory and bred in the animal
facility of Dartmouth College. Animals used in experiments
were between 7 and 12 weeks of age. All experiments were
conducted according to protocols approved by Dartmouth
College's Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Antimouse CD3e hybridoma 145.2C11 was obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). H-2Kb–restricted B3Z Tcell hybridoma cells which recognize the OVA257–264 epitope
were obtained from Dr. Nilabh Shastri (University of California
at Berkley). On activation, B3Z cells express the LacZ gene
(12). Murine colon cancer MC-38 cells (H-2b) were obtained
from Dr. Richard J. Barth (Dartmouth Medical School). Mouse
T-cell line lymphoma RMA and RMA/RG, ovarian cancer cells
ID8, and melanoma B16F10 have been described previously
(13–15). Mastocytoma cell line P815/Rae1 was generated by
retroviral transduction of P815 cells (H-2d) with a mouse
NKG2D ligand, Rae1. RMA and B16F10 cells are NKG2D
ligand-negative cells, whereas RMA/RG, P815/Rae1, ID8,
and B3Z cells are NKG2D ligand-positive cells. Packaging cells
PT67 (ATCC) and ovarian cancer ID8 cells were grown in
Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) with a high
glucose concentration (4.5 g/L) supplemented with 10% heatinactivated FBS (Atlanta Biologicals), 100 U/mL penicillin, 100
mg/mL streptomycin, 1 mmol/L pyruvate, 10 mmol/L HEPES,
0.1 mmol/L nonessential amino acids, and 50 mmol/L 2mercaptoethanol. All other cell lines were cultured in RPMI
plus the same supplements as in DMEM.
Construction of scFv-NKG2D
Variable regions of both heavy [VH, amino acids (aa) 1–136]
and light chains (VL, without signal peptide, aa 21–128) were
PCR amplified using cDNA derived from 145.2C11 hybridoma.
Extracellular domain of murine NKG2D was amplified using
the full-length NKG2D cDNA as a template (16). To make antiCD3e scFv, VH and VL were joined with a 15-amino acid glycine
(G)–serine (S) linker (G4S)3 (3 repeats of GGGGS). All PCR
reactions were conducted using a high-fidelity DNA polymerase Phusion (New England Biolabs). All oligos were synthesized by either Integrated DNA Technologies or SigmaGenosys. ScFv-NKG2D was created by joining anti-CD3e scFv
to the extracellular domain of mouse NKG2D (aa 90–232) with
a second (G4S)3 linker. A histidine tag (6xHis) was added at the
C-terminus to facilitate protein purification. The fusion gene
was then cloned into a retroviral vector pFB-neo (Stratagene).
A negative control fusion gene scFv-HuNKG2D was constructed by joining the scFv with the extracellular domain
of human NKG2D gene.

Production of scFv-NKG2D protein
ScFv-NKG2D proteins were expressed in retroviral vector
stably transduced B16F10 cells according to our previous
protocols (16, 17). Briefly, B16F10 cells were retrovirally
transduced with vectors that were generated from scFvNKG2D stably transfected packaging cell PT67 for 5 rounds.
Stable B16F10 cell lines with amplified expression of scFvNKG2D (either human or mouse version) were selected with
G418 (1.5 mg/mL) for 14 days. The resulting stable B16F10
lines (B16F10/scFv-mNKG2D and B16F10/scFv-HuNKG2D)
were then cultured in serum-free media (293 SFM II; Invitrogen). Supernatants were collected every 48 hours and were
subjected to affinity chromatography using HisTrap columns
(GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences) according to the manufacturer's
instructions. Eluted fractions were then concentrated and
desalted using Amicon Ultra columns (30K MWCO; Millipore).
Purified scFv-NKG2D proteins were resuspended in PBS,
filtered (pore size: 0.22 mm), and stored in 20 C. The integrity
of scFv-NKG2D protein was determined by SDS-PAGE, followed by staining with SYPRO orange (Invitrogen), and visualized using a Typhoon 9400 imager (GE Healthcare).
Concentration of scFV-NKG2D was quantitated with ImageJ
software (NIH; http://rsb.info.nih.gov/nih-image/Default.
html).
Flow cytometry
To determine whether scFv-NKG2D binds to CD3e, RMA
cells were stained with scFv-NKG2D (0.01–1 mg/mL), followed
by staining with phycoerythrin (PE)-labeled anti-mouse
NKG2D monoclonal antibody (mAb) (CX5; eBioscience) or
isotype control mAb. In a blocking experiment, RMA cells
were preincubated with anti-CD3e (0.01–1 mg/mL; 145.2C11,
eBioscience) at room temperature for 15 minutes before
staining with scFv-NKG2D. Rae1 expression was determined
by flow cytometry by using APC labeled pan-anti-Rae1 mAb
(clone 186107; R&D Systems). Infiltration of CD4þ and CD8þ T
cells, T-cell activation (CD69 expression), MDSCs (CD11bþF4/
80þGr1þ), and Tregs (CD4þFoxp3þ) in tumors were determined by flow cytometry after digestion of excised, established
tumors by using cocktails of DNAse and collagenase according
to our previous protocol (18). All samples were preincubated
with FcR block antibody (anti-mouse CD16/CD32) to reduce
nonspecific staining. Cell fluorescence was monitored using
an Accuri C6 flow cytometer. Flow cytometric analysis was
carried out using either Accuri or FlowJo software.
Cytokine production by T cells
To determine whether scFv-NKG2D can engage both T cells
and tumor cells and lead to T-cell activation, spleen cells were
stimulated with ConA and IL-2 for 4 days before coculture
with tumor cells with or without scFv-NKG2D (50 ng/mL) for
24 hours. Amounts of IFN-g in supernatants were analyzed
with ELISA. For tumor cells grown in suspension, coculture
with preactivated murine primary T cells (105) was done in
round-bottom 96-well plates at a ratio of 1:1, whereas adherent tumor cells (2.5  104) were cocultured with T cells in flatbottom plates. Tumor cells were irradiated (120 Gy) before
use. Cell-free supernatants were collected after 24 hours.

Zhang and Sentman

Twenty-four hour supernatants were assayed for IFN-g by
ELISA, using DuoSet ELISA kits (R&D Systems).
Cytotoxicity assay
Lysis of target cells was determined by a 5-hour 51Cr release
assay as previously described (16, 17).
BetaRed staining
The LacZ activity in B3Z cells was determined by using a
BetaRed b-galactosidase assay kit (EMD Bioscience) according to the manufacturer's instruction.
Tumor inoculation
For the determination of effects of local expression of scFvNKG2D on MC-38 or B16F10 tumor growth, either WT or scFvNKG2D–transduced tumor cells (5  105) were injected subcutaneously into the shaved right flank of recipient mice.
Tumors were then measured every 2 days with a caliper
and tumor areas were calculated. Mice were sacrificed when
tumor burden became excessive. Animals were regarded as
tumor free when no tumor was found 4 weeks after inoculation. For the rechallenge experiments, mice were inoculated
with 105 WT MC-38 cells on the shaved left flank. In the
systemic lymphoma model, B6 mice were injected with 105
RMA/RG cells via tail veins in 400 mL of HBSS. For treatment
with recombinant scFv-NKG2D proteins (either mouse or
human NKG2D fusion protein), mice were administered
intravenously with 5 mg scFv-NKG2D on days 5, 7, and 9
post–tumor inoculations. Mice were monitored closely and
sacrificed when moribund signs were observed.
Statistical analysis
Differences between groups were analyzed using Student's t
test. Values of P < 0.05 were considered significant. Kaplan–
Meier survival curves were plotted and analyzed using the
GraphPad Prism software (GraphPad Software).

Results
Construction and expression of scFv-NKG2D
ScFv-NKG2D was constructed by joining anti-CD3e scFv to
the extracellular domain of NKG2D receptor. The structure of
scFv-NKG2D is shown in Figure 1. Two 15-aa (G4S)3 linkers
were inserted between VH and VL and between scFv and
NKG2D to allow flexible interactions among scFv-NKG2D,
CD3e, and NKG2D ligands. Human NKG2D was also used
to make a control fusion protein scFv-HuNKG2D because
human NKG2D receptor has minimal cross-reactivity with
mouse NKG2D ligands. In scFv, the antibody Fc fragment is
removed. Therefore, binding of these fusion proteins to FcRpositive cells [such as macrophages, B cells, neutrophils,
dendritic cells (DC), and endothelial cells via the Fc region]
is eliminated, resulting in less nontumor associated T-cell
activation. As shown in Figure 1B, purified scFv-NKG2D
proteins are monomers at sizes around 50 kD under both
native and reducing conditions, which were in line with the
expected sizes of 44 kD.

Figure 1. Structure of scFv-NKG2D. A, anti-CD3e VH and VL are linked with
a G4S linker (L1) and fused to the extracellular domain (Ex) of NKG2D
receptor with the second G4S linker (L2) in between. For the convenience
of protein purification, a histidine tag (6 repeats of histidine, 6xHis) was
added at the C-termini. B, scFv-NKG2D proteins express as monomers.
Transiently transfected 293T cells that were cultured in serum-free media
(Invitrogen) were used to express scFv-NKG2D fusion proteins. Both
human (Hu, ve control) and mouse extracellular NKG2D (Ms) portions
were fused to anti-mouse CD3e scFv. Recombinant proteins were purified
through nickel columns. The sizes and purity of protein samples were
checked by SDS-PAGE either in native (without b-ME) or reducing
conditions (with b-ME). The expressed scFv-NKG2Ds showed sizes
around 50 kD, which are similar to expected 44 kD.

ScFv-NKG2D fusion protein binds to both CD3« and
NKG2D ligands
To determine whether scFv-NKG2D fusion protein preserves the binding affinity and specificity of the parental
anti-CD3e 145-2C11 antibody, CD3þNKG2D T-cell lymphoma RMA cells were stained with scFv-NKG2D (0.01–1
mg/mL), followed by staining with anti–NKG2D-PE
(Fig. 2A). As shown in Figure 2B, scFv-NKG2D binds to
CD3e in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, preincubation
of RMA cells with 145-2C11 mAb (0.1–10 mg/mL) could block
the binding of the scFv-NKG2D fusion protein to RMA cells in
a dose-dependent manner, indicating the specific recognition
of CD3e molecule by scFv-NKG2D (Fig. 2C).
To examine whether scFv-NKG2D was capable of binding
simultaneously to both T cells via scFv and tumor cells via
NKG2D (Fig. 2D), a mouse T hybridoma B3Z was used. B3Z T
cells express both CD3e and an NKG2D ligand Mult1 (data not
shown). We hypothesized that if scFv-NKG2D binds to CD3e
and Mult1 on B3Z cells simultaneously, cross-linking of CD3e
molecule will lead to activation of T cells. Because B3Z cells
contain the IL-2 promoter–controlled LacZ gene as a reporter,
after activation, B3Z cells will express LacZ (b-galactosidase).
The ability of scFv-NKG2D to stimulate Mult1þ B3Z cells was
evaluated by measurement of the OD570 nm or OD550 nm values
after addition of a BetaRed substrate. As expected, incubation

Figure 2. scFv-NKG2D can engage both T cells and tumor cells. A, schematic demonstration of binding assay of scFv-NKG2D to T cells. A T-cell
lymphoma cell line RMA (105, CD3þNKG2D), which does not express ligands for NKG2D, was stained with scFV-NKG2D (0.01–1 mg/mL), followed by
staining with anti-NKG2D-PE. Samples were analyzed with an Accuri C6 flow cytometer. B, surface levels of NKG2D on RMA cells after staining with
scFv-NKG2D are shown. C, anti-CD3 mAb can competitively block the binding of scFv-NKG2D to CD3 molecule in a dose-dependent manner. To confirm that
scFv-NKG2D binds to CD3 molecule, RMA cells were preincubated with anti-CD3 mAb (0.1–10 mg/mL) before staining with scFv-NKG2D. D, scFv-NKG2D can
activate T cells after cross-linking both CD3 and NKG2D ligands. CD3þ and NKG2D ligand Mult1þ T-cell hybridoma B3Z cells (106/mL) were cultured
in the presence of scFV-NKG2D (0.01–1 mg/mL) for 24 hours. T-cell activation (b-galactosidase activity) was analyzed using a BetaRed analysis as described in
Materials and Methods. scFv-HuNKG2D fusion protein was used as a negative control because human NKG2D receptor does not cross-react with
mouse NKG2D ligands.

of B3Z cells with scFv-NKG2D, but not with control molecule
scFv-HuNKG2D (human), led to cell activation in a dosedependent manner, indicating that the scFv-NKG2D can
engage both T and tumor cells via NKG2D ligands. On the
basis of data (Fig. 2D), we estimate the ED50 value of scFvNKG2D for activating T cells was about 10 ng/mL.
ScFv-NKG2D activates primary T cells by producing
IFN-g and exerting cytotoxicity
To investigate whether scFv-NKG2D stimulates primary T
cells, we examined IFN-g production and cytotoxicity of T cells
against tumor cells in the presence of scFv-NKG2D. ConA and
IL-2 (25 U/mL) preactivated T cells were used as effector cells.
As shown in Figure 3A and B, in the presence of scFv-NKG2D
(50 ng/mL), T cells produced significant amounts of IFN-g
after coculture with NKG2D ligand–positive cells (RMA/Rae1,
P815/Rae1, and ID8) but not with ligand-negative RMA and
B16F10 cells, indicating that scFv-NKG2D allows T cells to
functionally recognize NKG2D ligand–bearing tumor cells. In
contrast, control protein scFv-HuNKG2D does not significantly stimulate T cells to produce IFN-g in the presence of
NKG2D ligand–positive tumor cells. These data indicate that

anti-CD3e scFv itself has minimal ability to activate T cells
under these conditions. T-cell cytotoxicity in the presence of
scFv-NKG2D against various tumor cells was also determined.
As shown in Figure 3C, T cells could lyse NKG2D ligand–
positive target cells (P815/Rae1, ID8, and MC-38) but not the
ligand-negative cell line B16F10 in vitro in the presence of
scFv-NKG2D. Similar to IFN-g production, no significant killing was observed when control protein scFv-HuNKG2D was
used. In addition, we also showed that scFv-NKG2D did not
affect NK cell–mediated cytotoxicity against tumor cells
despite the fact that incubation of high concentration (1
mg/mL) of scFv-NKG2D with tumor cells reduced surface
NKG2D ligand expression (Supplementary Fig. S1).
ScFv-NKG2D suppresses growth of NKG2D ligand–
positive tumor cells in vivo and induces a host memory
response
Having shown that T cells could react against NKG2D
ligand–positive tumor cells in vitro after engagement with
scFv-NKG2D, we determined the therapeutic potential of
scFv-NKG2D in vivo. First, colon cancer MC-38 cells that
stably secreted scFv-mNKG2D (Supplementary Fig. S2) were

tested for growth in vivo after subcutaneous injection. This
design represents a localized scenario for scFv-NKG2D treatment that could be produced by exogenous gene transfer. MC38 cells expressing scFv-HuNKG2D fusion protein were used
as the negative control. There was no significant difference
between WT and scFv-NKG2D–expressing MC-38 cells to
grow in vitro (data not shown). As shown in Figure 4A,
scFv-mNKG2D expression by MC-38 tumor cells significantly
reduced or prevented tumor growth compared with WT and
scFv-HuNKG2D–expressing MC-38 tumor cells. Fifty-nine
percent of B6 mice (13/22) receiving MC-38/scFv-mNKG2D
tumor cells were tumor-free after 30 days. In a second and
more stringent model, lymphoma-bearing mice that had been
given NKG2D ligand–positive T-cell lymphoma RMA/RG cells
intravenously were treated with 3 doses of either recombinant
scFv-mNKG2D (5 mg per dose i.v.) or scFv-HuNKG2D (specificity control). As shown in Figure 4B, systemic administration
of scFv-mNKG2D significantly improved survival of tumorbearing mice. The median survival increased from 18 days

2070

Cancer Res; 71(6) March 15, 2011

(HBSS) to 31 days (P < 0.01), whereas treatment with control
molecule scFv-HuNKG2D lead only to median survival of 23
days. In addition, 39% (7/18) of the scFv-mNKG2D–treated
lymphoma-bearing mice were tumor free after 45 days. As for
toxicity, the animals treated with scFv-mNKG2D proteins did
not show any overt evidence of inflammatory damage (e.g.,
ruffled hair, hunchback, or diarrhea), suggesting there was no
overt toxicity (data not shown).
To determine whether treatment with scFv-NKG2D
induced a host memory response against WT tumor cells,
scFv-NKG2D–treated mice that had remained tumor free after
45 days were challenged with either WT MC-38 (105) or RMA
(NKG2D ligand-negative, 104) cells on their left flank. These
tumor-free mice were resistant to a subsequent challenge of
the same type of tumor cells, whereas all control naive mice
had large tumors after 3 weeks (Fig. 4C and D). This observation indicated that scFv-NKG2D treatment induced hosts
to generate specific immunologic memory against tumor
antigens.

Host adaptive immunity is involved in scFv-NKG2D–
mediated antitumor efficacy
Because scFv-NKG2D protein uses T cells to target tumor
cells, it is expected that the absence of T cells would render
scFv-NKG2D treatment ineffective in reducing tumor growth.
To test this hypothesis, either WT MC-38 or scFv-NKG2D–
expressing MC-38 cells (MC-38/scFv-NKG2D) were inoculated

mice, which lack T and B lymphocytes. As expected, both WT
and MC-38/scFv-NKG2D cells grew progressively in B6.
RAG1/ mice (Fig. 5A). Thus, lymphocytes play an obligate
role in scFv-NKG2D–mediated antitumor growth in vivo.
gd T cells constitute a major T-cell subset in skin and
intestine and can be harnessed for cancer immunotherapy
(19). Therefore, scFv-NKG2D may mobilize and activate gd T
cells against subcutaneous tumors, resulting in tumor reduction. The role of gd T cells was investigated by inoculating
either WT MC-38 or scFv-mNKG2D–expressing MC-38/scFvNKG2D cells into TCRa-deficient mice, in which ab T cells are
deficient and gd T cells remain intact (20). MC-38 cells that
express scFv-NKG2D show markedly slower growth than
those that express WT tumors (Fig. 5A). However, no

tumor-free mice were obtained. This result suggests that gd
T cells play a role in scFv-NKG2D–mediated therapeutic
efficacy against subcutaneous tumors but ab T cells are also
required for efficient antitumor effects.
Tumor-associated host cells play roles in scFv-NKG2D–
mediated antitumor efficacy
Several studies have shown that some immune cells, such as
Tregs and MDSCs express NKG2D ligands (10). Nausch and
colleagues showed that CD11bþF4/80þGr1þ MDSCs isolated
from tumor-bearing mice but not myeloid cells from naive
mice expressed an NKG2D ligand, Rae1. Interestingly, these
tumor-associated MDSCs can stimulate NK cells to produce
IFN-g in a manner that is partially dependent on the interaction between NKG2D and its ligands (10). In fact, NKG2D
can be used to target Tregs at the tumor site in ovarian cancer
(11). To determine whether tumor-associated host cells are
involved in scFv-NKG2D–mediated therapeutic efficacy, we
tested the effects of local expression of scFv-NKG2D on the
growth of B16F10 tumors, which do not express NKG2D
ligands in vitro or in vivo (Supplementary Fig. S3). If B16F10
tumor–associated host cells (such as MDSCs and Tregs) are

ligand–negative tumor growth. A, either WT (circle) or scFv-NKG2D–expressing (square) MC-38 cells were injected subcutaneously (5  105) into right flanks of
Rag1/ (unfilled) or TCRa/ (filled) mice on day 0. Error bars, SEM of 3 pooled independent experiments. Local expression of scFv-NKG2D significantly (P <

targeted by scFv-NKG2D, it would be expected that B16F10
tumor growth may be reduced by the local expression of scFvNKG2D. As shown in Figure 5B, local expression of scFvNKG2D significantly reduced B16F10 tumor growth, suggesting that scFv-NKG2D may target ligand-positive, tumor-associated host cells. There was no difference between B16F10 and
B16F10/scFv-NKG2D in terms of in vitro growth (Supplementary Fig. S4).
To further understand whether Tregs and MDSCs can be
targeted, we first checked the NKG2D ligand Rae1 expression
on those cells in both MC-38 and B16F10 models. As shown in
Supplementary Figure S5C, Rae1 was expressed on tumor
(both MC-38 and B16F10)-derived Tregs (CD4þFoxp3þ) and
MDSCs (CD11bþF4/80þGr1þ). In contrast, CD4þFoxp3þ and
CD11bþF4/80þGr1þ cells from naive B6 spleens did not
express Rae1, suggesting that tumor microenvironment plays
a role in NKG2D ligand expression. Next, it was tested whether
local expression of scFv-NKG2D could alter the ratios of
effector CD4þ/Treg and Gr1/Gr1þ (CD11bþF4/80þ), using
the B16F10 melanoma model. If tumor-derived Tregs and
MDSCs were targeted, one would expect lower percentages
of these cells in tumors. As shown in Figure 6, local expression
of scFv-NKG2D by B16F10 cells significantly (P < 0.01) reduced
the percentage of both Tregs (Fig. 6A) and MDSCs (Fig. 6B) at
the tumor site. In addition, Rae1 expression by those cells was
lower in the presence of scFv-NKG2D (Fig. 6C), consistent with
the targeting of tumor-derived Tregs and MDSCs by scFVNKG2D. Overall, these data support the idea that NKG2D can
be used to target both tumor cells and their supportive
immunosuppressive cells.
Local expression of scFv-NKG2D leads to increased
recruitment of T cells
Because local expression of scFv-NKG2D resulted in
reduced tumor growth, we hypothesized that more T cells

2072

Cancer Res; 71(6) March 15, 2011

may be recruited to tumor sites and become more activated.
To test the hypothesis, WT B16F10 or B16F10/scFv-NKG2D
cells (5  105 cells) were injected into the right flanks of B6
mice. The infiltration of T cells (both CD4þ and CD8þ) and
activation of T cells, as shown by expression of an activation
marker CD69þ, were determined by flow cytometry 19 days
post–tumor inoculation. As shown in Figure 7A and C, the
percentage of both CD4þ and CD8þ T cells was significantly
increased in the presence of scFv-NKG2D. In addition, T cells
(especially CD8þ T cells) had a significantly increased expression of CD69, which was consistent with an activated status
(Fig. 7B and D).

Discussion
Immunotherapy has emerged as a promising method to
treat cancers due to the ability to selectively eliminate tumors.
Both vaccination and adoptive immune cell transfer have been
utilized against cancers (3). DC-based vaccines have been
tested in both animal models and clinical trials. However,
DCs need to be delicately conditioned with toll-like receptor
agonists and cytokines to ensure delivery of both primary and
costimulatory signals for T-cell stimulation (21). Otherwise, T
cells may be induced into a tolerant state. Although DC-based
immunotherapy has proven clinically safe and efficient to
induce tumor-specific immune responses, only a limited
number of objective clinical responses have been reported
in cancer patients (22). In the second strategy, adoptive
transfer of T cells or allogeneic bone marrow cells can be
carried out (23). However, the traditional approaches for
obtaining large numbers of tumor-specific T cells are difficult.
Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation can cause severe
acute graft-versus-host disease, and response rate is less than
15% (23). Compared with these 2 strategies, scFV-NKG2D no
longer relies on generation of specific T cells or a regular

antigen presentation by DCs. scFv-NKG2D stimulates host T
cells in an MHC-independent manner. Therefore scFv-NKG2D
is unlikely to be affected by well-documented tumor-escape
strategies, such as "downregulation" of MHC expression.
Unlike most of other bispecific molecules in which a specific
tumor-targeting scFv has to be made for targeting certain
types of tumors, scFv-NKG2D is a pan-tumor–targeting
reagent because NKG2D ligands are expressed on many types
of tumor cells (colon, ovarian, breast, prostate, melanoma,
leukemia, and lymphoma, among others). In addition, NKG2D
ligands have restricted expression in normal tissues (9), but
they are also expressed on immunosuppressive cells within
the tumor microenvironment.
In this study, scFv-NKG2D treatment reduced or abrogated
the growth of NKG2D ligand–positive tumors, suggesting that
scFv-NKG2D in vivo can lead to effective T-cell activation and
elicit host T-cell responses to tumor cells. Possible mechanisms for this may be the small size of scFv-NKG2D (50 kD)
and existence of flexible linkers which allow efficient formation of immunologic synapses and reduce a steric barrier

imposed by large, abundant glycoproteins such as CD43 and
CD45 (24). In adult humans, about one half of the T cells are
memory cells based on the expression of a memory marker
CD45RO and their ability to respond to allogeneic cells (25).
Therefore, these memory T cells may be primed by NKG2D
ligand–positive tumor cells in the presence of scFv-NKG2D
even without the help of costimulatory molecules. Full-length
anti-CD3 mAb, even in very small quantities, can induce T-cell
activation and its associated toxicity in vivo (26). Nonspecific
T-cell activation is primarily due to antibody Fc fragment
binding to FcR, which leads to CD3 cross-linking, because
anti-CD3–induced nonspecific T-cell activation was significantly reduced using enzymatically produced F(ab0 ) (26, 27).
In scFv-NKG2D, the Fc fragment was removed. Therefore,
nonspecific T-cell activation due to Fc-mediated events and
related toxicities are expected to be low.
Immunosuppressive cells within the tumor microenvironment have been shown to prevent antitumor immunity (28,
29). Effective therapies must not only attack the tumor but
must also change the local microenvironment leading to

inhibition of tumor growth. Recent studies have shown that
myeloid suppressive cells and Tregs express NKG2D ligands
(10, 30). Both cell types make significant contribution in the
immunosuppression of tumor microenvironment. The findings that even NKG2D ligand–deficient tumor cells can be
affected by scFv-NKG2D treatment suggest that scFv-NKG2D
allows T cells to attack host immunosuppressive cells. Nausch
and colleagues showed that adoptive transfer of NK cells
reduced numbers of CD11bþF4/80þGr1þ MDSC cells but
not the percentages of CD11bþF4/80Gr1þ cells in tumorbearing mice, suggesting that these MDSCs were targeted in
vivo by adoptively transferred NK cells (10). Barber and
colleagues showed that NKG2D can be used as a targeting
strategy against Tregs within the tumor microenvironment
(11). Our results showed that in both MC-38 and B16F10
models, MDSCs and Tregs expressed the NKG2D ligand
Rae1, which is consistent with previous findings. Local expression of scFv-NKG2D in tumors significantly reduced the
percentage of these immunosuppressive cells, providing more
convincing evidence that MDSCs and Tregs can be targeted by
scFv-NKG2D.
In TCRa/ mice, ab T cells are lacking whereas gd T cells
remain normal (20). As shown in Figure 7, scFv-NKG2D
expression by MC-38 cells also reduced tumor growth in
TCRa/ mice, suggesting that host gd T cells can be redirected against NKG2D ligand–positive tumors by scFv-NKG2D.
gd T cells are abundant in skin and mucosa tissues (31). Many
studies have suggested that gd T cells are important components in antitumor immunity (32, 33). Therefore, in this model,
gd T cells may play a significant role in scFv-NKG2D–
mediated early antitumor responses.

Because NKT cells also express CD3, it is possible that scFvNKG2D may engage NKT cells to tumor cells, leading to
antitumor responses. It has been shown that administration
of a-galactosylceramide (aGalCer, an agonist of NKT cells),
aGalCer-loaded DCs, or aGalCer-loaded soluble CD1d molecule (aGalCer/sCD1d) could induce significant IFNg–producing NKT responses and protect against the development of metastases with B16 melanoma after (34, 35).
However, success of aGalCer treatment in humans has been
limited. The partial reason may be that in humans, there exist
anti-a-linked sugar natural antibodies that do not exist in the
mouse (36, 37). Lung and liver contain abundant NKT cells,
which may play an important role in keeping tumor metastasis in check (34, 35, 38). Expression of membrane-bound
anti-CD3 scFv and CD86 on B16 melanoma cells has been
shown to suppress tumor growth in vivo and protect mice
from B16 rechallenge. In the subcutaneous B16 model, NKT
cells have been shown to play a critical role in in vivo
antitumor activity (39). Therefore, it is possible that scFvNKG2D may also engage both NKT and tumor cells, resulting
in vivo antitumor activity.
T-cell infiltration into tumors (especially CD8þ T cells) is
often correlated with improved survival (40–42). Recent
studies have shown that tumor-specific CD4þ T cells could
also differentiate in vivo into cytotoxic T cells and induce
regression of established melanoma (43, 44). The results that
local expression of scFv-NKG2D increased recruitment of T
cells and reduced tumor growth are consistent with these
findings. The possible mechanisms for enhanced T-cell
infiltration after scFv-NKG2D treatment may be that
scFv-NKG2D engages NKG2D ligand–positive cells in

tumors and resident and/or newly arrived T cells, resulting
in T-cell activation and production of IFN-g leading to IFNg–inducible chemokines such as CXCL9 and CXCL10 (the
ligands for CXCR3),CCL2 (the ligand for CCR2), and CCL11
(the ligand for CCR2 and CCR5; ref. 44). These chemokines
may attract more T cells to tumor sites and help eliminate
tumors.
Regulation of NKG2D ligand expression can occur on multiple levels (transcriptional, posttranscriptional, and posttranslational levels; ref. 9). DNA pathways initiated by ATM (ataxia
telangiectasia, mutated) or ATR (ATM- and Rad3-related)
protein kinases have been shown to play important roles in
upregulation of NKG2D ligands (45). Many anticancer drugs
can also upregulate NKG2D ligands (46), which not only
potentially enhances the host NK cell antitumor activity
but also suggests possible synergistic effects of these drugs
with scFv-NKG2D treatment.
In view of the wide expression of NKG2D ligands on many
human cancers and Tregs and MDSCs, the strategy described
here has a promising potential to treat many human cancers
by direct and indirect mechanisms. The ability of scFv-NKG2D
to induce long-term immunologic memory may be beneficial
to cancer patients with minimal residual disease. Collectively,
our findings suggest that scFv-NKG2D represents a promising

alternative to elicit host immunity for effective immunotherapy against cancer.
