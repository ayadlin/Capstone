BACKGROUND: Capecitabine has antitumor activity in metastatic breast cancer (MBC); however, its optimal dose
and schedule remain unclear. Mathematical modeling predicts that a capecitabine schedule 7 days of treatment followed by 7 days of rest (7—7) will improve efficacy and minimize toxicity. Bevacizumab has demonstrated the ability
to improve outcomes when it is added to chemotherapy, including capecitabine, in the first-line and second-line settings. METHODS: Patients with measurable MBC received oral capecitabine (2000 mg twice daily; 7—7), and intravenous bevacizumab (10 mg/kg every 2 weeks). The primary endpoint was the response rate. Secondary endpoints
included toxicity, the clinical benefit rate, and progression-free survival (PFS). RESULTS: Forty-one patients were
treated. After a median of 7 cycles (range, 1-32 cycles), partial responses were observed in 20% of patients, and
stable disease for 6 months was noted in 35% patients. The median PFS was 8 months. The most common treatment-related toxicities were hand-foot syndrome (49% grade 2, 20% grade 3/4) hypertension (12% grade 2, 10%
grade 3/4), and fatigue (12% grade 2, 2% grade 3/4). Diarrhea (5% grade 2, 0% grade 3/4), nausea (0% grade 2-4),
and vomiting (0% grade 2-4) were rare. CONCLUSIONS: Capecitabine administered for 7 days followed by a 7-day
rest in combination with bevacizumab had modest efficacy and an acceptable toxicity profile in patients with MBC.

Improvements in early detection and advances in the therapy of early stage breast cancer have led to a decline in

breast cancer-related mortality over the past 2 decades.1 However, the goals of treatment for metastatic disease remain
largely palliative even as prolongation of survival is increasingly possible. In this context, the limiting of treatment-related
side effects is a concurrent objective.
Capecitabine (Xeloda; Genentech, South San Francisco, Calif) is an orally administered fluoropyrimidine with
established activity against metastatic breast cancer (MBC).2 It is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) as monotherapy at a dose of 2500 mg/m2 (divided twice daily) for 14 days using a 21-day treatment cycle for
anthracycline-resistant and taxane-resistant MBC and in combination with docetaxel for anthracycline-pretreated disease.3-8 Several trials also have demonstrated efficacy for capecitabine combined with chemotherapy (ixabepilone) and
newer targeted agents, such as bevacizumab, trastuzumab, and lapatinib.9-12
At the standard single-agent dose (1250 mg/m2 twice daily) and schedule, typical capecitabine-related adverse events
include hand-foot syndrome, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and stomatitis, which often result in dose reductions and truncated treatment cycles.7,8,13-15 Dose interruptions or reductions have been reported in as many as 65% of patients

receiving capecitabine at the FDA-recommended dose
level and schedule in clinical trials, and as many as 16% of
patients in studies have discontinued the drug because of
toxicity rather than disease progression.12,14
Several studies have explored alternative capecitabine doses and schedules as monotherapy and in capecitabine-based combinations for both breast and colorectal
cancers.16-20 However, these dose modifications were
derived empirically with unclear impact on patient
outcome.
Our group developed a mathematical method to
optimize therapeutic dosing based on the Norton-Simon
model of tumor growth, in which schedules are determined based on efficacy rather than toxicity.21 When this
model was applied to capecitabine, a 7-day-on/7-day-off
(7—7) schedule was predicted as optimal. This was confirmed in animal models. We then determined that the
maximal tolerated dose of capecitabine 7—7 was 2000
mg as a flat dose given twice daily in a phase 1 trial to
patients with MBC.22 In that study, the 7—7 schedule
suggested an improved therapeutic index and justified exploration in phase 2 studies.
We now report the results from a phase 2 trial of
capecitabine 7—7 in combination with bevacizumab for
the treatment of patients with MBC. At the time of trial
design, the antivascular endothelial growth factor antibody bevacizumab had just demonstrated improvement
in progression-free survival (PFS) when added to paclitaxel in the first-line setting.23 These and other data suggested that capecitabine 7—7 and bevacizumab may be an
effective combination.24

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Eligibility
Patients with histologically confirmed breast cancer were
eligible if they had metastatic disease measurable by
Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST).
Any number of prior chemotherapy regimens was permitted; however, prior treatment with bevacizumab or a fluoropyrimidine for MBC was not allowed. Patients with
human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer (a 3þ score on immunohistochemistry or
a fluorescent in situ hybridization score >2) could no longer be candidates for HER2-targeted therapy. Forty-one
patients were enrolled at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer
Center (MSKCC) from March 2007 to December 2008.
Additional eligibility criteria included an Eastern
Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 2 and

4126

adequate hepatic, renal, and hematologic function. Exclusion criteria included chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or
investigational therapy 3 weeks before initiating study
treatment. All patients had baseline computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging studies of the brain,
and those with brain metastases were ineligible. Major
surgery 28 days before treatment, nonhealing wounds,
known gastrointestinal malabsorption syndrome, and
baseline proteinuria (urine protein:creatinine [UPC] ratio
>1.0) were additional exclusion criteria. Patients with
clinically significant cardiovascular disease (eg, uncontrolled hypertension, myocardial infarction, and unstable
angina), a history of arterial thrombotic events 6
months, or current use of warfarin were excluded. The
MSKCC institutional review board approved this protocol. All patients provided written informed consent.
Study Design and Treatment
This was a nonrandomized, open-label, phase 2 trial conducted at MSKCC. The primary objective was to estimate
the overall response rate (RR) (ie, complete response [CR]
þ partial response [PR]) to capecitabine 7—7 in combination with bevacizumab for the treatment of MBC. Secondary endpoints included toxicity, the clinical benefit
rate (RR þ stable disease [SD] 24 weeks), and PFS.
Capecitabine 2000 mg was administered orally
twice daily for 7 days followed by a 7-day rest, and this
schedule was repeated to complete a 4-week cycle. Bevacizumab 10 mg/kg was administered intravenously every 2
weeks with a treatment window of 2 days.
Patients were treated until they developed disease
progression or had unacceptable adverse events. There
were no dose modifications of bevacizumab during this
study. For grade 3 or 4 bevacizumab-related toxicities,
bevacizumab was held until symptoms resolved to grade
1. Capecitabine could be continued if bevacizumab was
held. Capecitabine treatment delays were required for
grade 2 toxicities. If a dose was delayed for >2 weeks
because of toxicity, then the patient was withdrawn from
the study. A maximum of 2 dose reductions were permitted per patient, stipulated according to grade and number
of appearances. Bevacizumab was held if capecitabine
required a dose delay. The use of erythropoietin-stimulating agents was permitted on study; however, granulocytecolony–stimulating factor was not permitted.
Patient Evaluation
Patients were evaluated for toxicity weekly during the first
cycle and every 2 weeks during subsequent cycles

according to the National Cancer Institute Common
Toxicity Criteria version 3.0 (NCI CTC v3.0). Proteinuria was monitored by UPC ratio once per cycle. Radiographic response was evaluated every 3 cycles with
radiographic scans reviewed by a designated study radiologist according to RECIST. When responses occurred,
scans were repeated a minimum of 4 weeks later for confirmation according to RECIST.
Statistical Considerations
The primary endpoint of this trial was the response rate,
which we defined as the proportion of patients that
achieved a CR or a PR. A Simon mini-max 2-stage design
was used to test the null hypothesis of a 10% response rate
against the alternative of a 25% response rate for the combination of capecitabine 7—7 and bevacizumab. The
probabilities of type I and type II errors were set at 0.1.
Twenty-seven patients were accrued to the first stage of
the study. If 3 responses were observed, then an addi-

tional 13 patients would accrue to the second stage of the
study. If >6 of 40 patients had an objective response, then
the capecitabine 7—7 schedule in combination with bevacizumab would be worthy of further study. An early termination rule was included for toxicity: If 12 patients in
the first stage experienced treatment-related grade 3 or 4
nonhematologic toxicity, then the trial would be stopped.
There were several secondary endpoints. Toxicities
were summarized using NCI CTC v3.0, and the maximum grade per patient was used as a summary measure.
The clinical benefit rate was calculated with exact 95%
confidence intervals (CIs). PFS was defined from start of
therapy to progression of disease or the last date of followup and was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method.

RESULTS
Forty-one patients were enrolled between March 2007
and December 2008. Patient characteristics are listed in
Table 1. One patient withdrew consent 3 days after beginning study treatment, which left 40 patients evaluable for
response; however, all 41 patients were evaluable for
toxicity.
Efficacy
Efficacy, as measured by the overall response rate (CR þ
PR), was the primary endpoint of this study (Table 2). After a median of 7 cycles (range 1-32 cycles), 8 of 40 patients
(20%; 95% CI, 9%-36%) had a PR confirmed according
to RECIST as their best response. There were no CRs.
Fourteen patients (35%) had SD for 6 months. Of the 8
patients who attained a PR, the median response duration
was 7.1 months (range, 2.8-25.2 months); for the 14
patients who had SD for 6 months, the median response
duration was 9.9 months (range, 6.0-30.8 months). The
clinical benefit rate (RR þ SD >6 months) was 55%.
Eleven patients had SD for <6 months. Seven patients had

patients required delays of bevacizumab because of
hypertension.
There were 3 potentially serious treatment-related
adverse events. One patient was hospitalized for newonset grade 3 atrial fibrillation; in that patient, study
drugs were discontinued because of inability to receive
warfarin while on capecitabine according to the protocol.
One patient experienced epigastric/chest pain during bevacizumab infusion and was hospitalized; cardiac in that
patient, evaluation for ischemia was negative, but grade 3
portal vein thrombosis was identified incidentally.
Another patient developed grade 4 thrombosis with pulmonary embolism requiring anticoagulation, and she was
taken off study according to the protocol.
Nine patients discontinued therapy because of drugrelated toxicities, which included hand-foot syndrome
(grade 3, n ¼ 2; grade 2, n ¼ 3), thrombosis (pulmonary
embolism: grade 4, n ¼ 1), neutropenia (grade 3, n ¼ 2),
and headache (grade 2, n ¼ 1). Five patients withdrew
from protocol therapy for other reasons, including 1
patient who developed an unrelated gynecologic malignancy, 2 patients who required treatment with medications
that have known interactions while taking capecitabine,
and 2 patients who withdrew informed consent.

DISCUSSION
Capecitabine has proven palliative benefit as a treatment
for MBC. This palliation may be compromised by the
well documented toxicities patients experience when
using the FDA-approved dose and schedule.25 The resulting empiric adjustments in dose size and treatment duration largely have an unknown impact on treatment
efficacy. Retrospective studies and even some randomized,
prospective trials in metastatic disease have suggested that
reduced-dose capecitabine delivered on a 14—7 schedule
may achieve results comparable to those achieved with the
conventional dose, but those results were not definitive
and often were confounded.16-18 Prospective randomized
studies often have explored reduced-dose capecitabine in
doublets with other cytotoxic agents, making these data
difficult to interpret for the impact of the modified capecitabine dose alone.19,26-28 An additional complication
arises from data indicating that body surface area-based
dosing may not be ideal.29
We developed a method to predict the optimal dosing of chemotherapy and applied it specifically to capecitabine. In xenograft models of breast cancer, we explored
Cancer

the optimal dosing predicted with this model by identifying the schedule of treatment that led to maximal
effect.21,22 Then, we confirmed the predictions of the
model in animal experiments and in a single-agent phase
1 trial that formed the foundation for our current study in
which we added bevacizumab for the treatment of HER-2
normal MBC. Our decision to add bevacizumab to capecitabine in this study was based on data, which were
emerging at the time of trial design and subsequently were
confirmed, indicating that the antibody improves
response rate and PFS when added to chemotherapy.23,24,30,31 The improvement in efficacy conferred by
bevacizumab does not generally potentiate chemotherapy-associated toxicity and may be chemotherapy agentindependent.
This phase 2 trial met its primary endpoint, demonstrating a response rate worthy of further study for the
combination of capecitabine 2000 mg twice daily on a 7—
7 schedule with bevacizumab. With all the caveats associated with cross-trial comparisons, the response rate of 20%
and the clinical benefit rate of 55% demonstrated here
may be weighed against the reported results from first-line
studies of conventionally dosed capecitabine with bevacizumab.12,24,32 Although only 88% of the patients in our
study received treatment as first-line therapy, the median
PFS of 8 months was consistent with the published literature for this combination given to entirely first-line populations. For example, in the first Regimens in Bevacizumab
for Breast Oncology trial (RIBBON-1), the addition of
bevacizumab to capecitabine in the first-line setting
achieved a median PFS of 8.6 months.32 Although our
response rate of 20% was lower than that reported in RIBBON-1 (35%), more of our patient population had
received previous therapy for metastatic disease and had exposure to adjuvant taxanes (54% vs approximately 40%).
Capecitabine 7—7 was associated with fewer gastrointestinal adverse events than expected. Grade 2 diarrhea
occurred in only 5% of patients compared with 16% of
patients who received conventional dosing.12 There were
no reports of grade 3/4 diarrhea or grade 2 nausea or
vomiting. These findings support optimization of the
therapeutic index, because diarrhea can be a significant
and potentially life-threatening adverse event. In the current study, the incidence of hand-foot syndrome with the
7—7 schedule (20% grade 3/4) was similar to that in previous reports with conventional-schedule capecitabine,
which ranged from 13% to 22%. It is significant that the
only treatment-related grade 4 adverse event was attributed to bevacizumab, supporting the improved

4129

Original Article

tolerability predicted by the mathematical model on
which this schedule was derived. The rate of common
capecitabine-related toxicities agreed with our phase 1
data for capecitabine 7—7 monotherapy with grade 3
hand-foot syndrome and diarrhea rates of 17% and 6%,
respectively.22 The addition of bevacizumab therapy did
not appear to potentiate capecitabine-related toxicities.
Bevacizumab-related adverse events of hypertension,
proteinuria, and thrombosis were uncommon and were
similar to the rates recently reported in randomized controlled bevacizumab trials.32,33 There were no unexpected
serious adverse events.
In the current study, the majority of study participants (78%) required a dose modification for capecitabine
while on study. However, the protocol required dose
adjustments for treatment-related grade 2 adverse events
and did not permit the use of granulocyte-colony–stimulating factor. Anticoagulation use initially was restricted
while were receiving bevacizumab; therefore, patients who
experienced thrombosis were required to discontinue study
therapy. We recognize that these parameters were more
stringent than those that are acceptable currently in clinical
practice and typically incorporated into clinical trials. Outside of a research study, many of the protocol-stipulated
dose modifications possibly may be avoided with the use of
growth factors and liberal supportive measures.
In summary, we successfully used a mathematical
model and xenograft experiments to predict a less toxic
and possibly equally effective dose and schedule of capecitabine for palliation of MBC. On the basis of our work,
we believe that capecitabine administered for 7 days followed by a 7-day rest has demonstrated efficacy worthy of
further study and that it may offer a favorable toxicity profile with respect to gastrointestinal side effects. Additional
phase 2 trials currently are testing the capecitabine 7—7
dosing schedule in combination with other targeted therapies.34 The definitive test of this schedule will be a comparative, randomized phase 3 trial of capecitabine 7—7
versus conventionally scheduled capecitabine that currently is planned for the treatment of patients with MBC.
