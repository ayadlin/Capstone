ABSTRACT
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play critical roles in variousbiological processes,including
malignancy. Here, we demonstrated that miR-30e levels were markedly reduced in
human lung carcinoma specimens in comparisonwith adjacent normal tissues.In
addition, miR-30eamounts were starkly lower in the resistant PC9/gefitinib (PC9G)
cancer cells compared with PC9 cells. Meanwhile, miR-30eoverexpression inPC9G
cells resulted in reduced cell proliferation and migration,reversing drug resistance
to gefitinib.Conversely,miR-30e silencing in PC9 cells increased proliferation as well
as migration, and conferred resistance to gefitinib.Moreover, HOXA1, which was
identified asa new miR-30etarget, plays important roles in regulating cell fate, early
developmental patterns and organogenesis.Importantly, miR-30ealso inhibited PC9G
growth in vivo. Taken together, these findings demonstrated that miR-30eshould
be considered a tumor suppressor miRNA, which could be used in treatinghuman
lung cancer.

INTRODUCTION

MiRNAs
are
endogenous
single-stranded
non-coding RNAsassociated with various types of cancer
[7]. They have essential functions in gene regulation,
andeffect many important pathophysiological processes
such as differentiation, development and tumorigenesis
[8–10]. MiRNAs mainly bind to the 3’-untranslated
region (3’-UTR) of mRNA molecules, suppressing
protein synthesis through mRNA degradation or
translational repression [11]. MiR-30ewas described
as a tumor suppressor gene in various cancers [12–14].
Here, we found that overexpressionof miR-30einlung
cancer cells resulted inreduced cell proliferation and
migration,reversing drug resistance to gefitinib.Known
miR-30e targets include Bmi1, P4HA1, BCR-ABL and
UBC9 [12–15]. However,how miR-30eregulates lung
cancer tumorigenesisremains unclear.
HOX genes belong to a highly conserved subgroup
of theHomeobox superfamily which characteristically

Lung carcinoma is the top killer among
cancers,claiming 1.4 million lives in the world yearly.
Non-small-cell lungcarcinoma (NSCLC) is found in
about 80% of primary lungcancer patients, who are
usually diagnosed in advanced stage despite current
efforts and improvements aimed at early diagnosis [1].
Although a variety of therapeutic options are available
for lung cancer patients, e.g. surgery, chemotherapy and
radiotherapy, five-year survival ratesremain critically low.
In patients with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)
activatingmutation, treatment with EGFR tyrosine kinase
inhibitors (TKIs), e.g. gefitinib,shows high efficacy [2].
However, acquired TKI resistance hampers the use of such
molecules. Increasing evidence suggests that miRNAs may
significantly affect the development and chemoresistance
of lung cancer [3–6].

HOX genes play critical roles in regulating cell fate as
well as early developmental events and organogenesis
[16–18]. Alterations in HOX genes are also associated
with multiple cancers in humans, e.g. lung, breast, and
hematological cancers [19–21].Here, we demonstrated that
miR-30e targetedHOXA1, whose expression was reduced
in miR-30e treated cells and conversely enhanced after
miR-30e inhibition.
It has been reported that miR-30e may play
important roles in cancerby affecting different signaling
pathways. The current data revealed that miR-30eamounts
were reduced in PC9Gcells in comparison with PC9
cells.We further characterized miR-30e and explore its
molecular mechanisms in lung cancer. Interestingly,
ectopic expression of miR-30e resulted reduced cell
proliferation andmigration, withinduced apoptosisin lung
cancer cells by suppressing the key target HOXA1. In
addition, miR-30e rendered PC9G cells more sensitive to
gefitinib in vitro and in vivo. These findings revealed a
novel mechanism for miR-30e, indicating that this miRNA
could be further assessed for the development of lung
cancer therapeutics.

model was established by transforming human lung cancer
PC9 cells via exposure to lower concentrations ofgefitinib
for 24 weeks (Figure 2A). Interestingly, miR-30e
amounts in PC9 cells wereelevated compared with values
obtained in theresistant PC9Gcell line (Figure 2B). PC9G
cells had resistancefeatures, including enhanced cell
proliferation andmigration, alongside lower apoptosis
rates (Figure 2C–2E). In addition, we found that PC9G
showedincreased cell proliferation andmigration, with
reduced apoptosis compared with PC9 cells.

High miR-30e levels in PC9G cells inhibit cancer
aggressiveness and reverses drug resistance to
gefitinib
MiR-30e amounts in resistant PC9G cells were lower
thanin PC9 cells.Interestingly, cell growth was reduced in
miR-30e-overexpressing lung cancer cells in comparison
with those transfected with miR-NC (Figure 3A and 3B).
We next assessed the impact of miR-30e on cell migration.
As shown in Figure 3C, miR-30e re-expression starkly
reduced the migrationability of lung cancer cells. What’s
more, overexpressionof miR-30e promoted cell apoptosis
(Figure 3D).We further found that miR-30eoverexpression
reversed drug resistance to gefitinib in PC9G cells
(Figure 3E).Thus, our results suggest miR-30e inhibited
tumor aggressiveness, and reversed drug resistance to
gefitinib.

RESULTS
MicroRNA-30e is markedly downregulated in
lung carcinoma

Repression of miR-30e in PC9 cells significantly
promotes cell growth and migration, also
conferring resistance to gefitinib

To assessthe role of miR-30e in lung cancer, miR-30e
amounts were assessed in 30 lung cancer tissues with the
corresponding adjacent normal tissuespecimens. RT-qPCR
showed that miR-30e was significant downregulated in
lung cancer tissues (Figure 1A). Then, human lung cancer
specimens were divided into 2 groups based on sensitivity
of gefitinib; interestingly, loweramounts of miR-30ewere
obtained in lung cancer patients with gefitinib resistance
(Figure 1B). To evaluate the effect of miR-30e on NSCLC
patientprognosis after treatment with EGFR-TKI, the
Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test were used to
examine normalized miR-30e levelsand Disease free
survival (DFS). Individuals displaying low miR-30e
levels showed reduced DFS as well asoverall survival
(OS) compared with thosedisplaying elevated miR-30e
amounts (Figure 1C, 1D).Thesefindings suggested that
loss of miR-30e may be associated with lung cancer
disease progression, and should be considered a potential
new biomarker for predicting poor prognosis in NSCLC.

To evaluate miR-30e function in lung cancer
carcinogenesis,PC9 cell growthwas assessed after
transfection with miR-30e-inhibitor. Interestingly,markedly
decreased miR-30e levels were observed after silencing
of the miRNA, resulting in increased PC9 cell growth
compared with the miR-NC-inhibitorgroup (Figure 4A).
Since migration is a very important malignancy
feature, the effects ofmiR-30e on cellmigration was
evaluated. As shown in Figure 4B, miR-30e-inhibition
dramatically induced the normally strong migration
capacity of lung cancer cells, promoting cell survival by
inducing apoptosis (Figure 4C).Furthermore, inhibition
of miR-30econferred resistance to gefitinib in PC9 cells
(Figure 4D). Thus, these results suggest that repression of
miR-30e in PC9 cells significantly promoted cell growth
andmigration, while conferring resistance to gefitinib.

PC9G cells shows higher activity of proliferation
and migration, and lower apoptosis rates
compared with PC9 cells

MiR-30e sensitizes HCC827/GR cells to gefitinib
Next, we adopted thehuman lung cancer cellline
HCC827 with its variant HCC827/GR cells which
exposure to indicated lower concentration gefitinib for
24 weeks (Figure 5A). Interestingly, miR-30e amounts

values of the resistant HCC827/GR cells (Figure 5B).
Meanwhile, HCC827/GR cells had resistance features,
including elevated cell proliferation and a reduced
apoptosis rate (Figure 5C–5D). Furthermore, high
miR-30e amounts reversed drug resistance to gefitinib in
HCC827/GR cells (Figure 5E).Meanwhile, inhibition of
miR-30epromotedchemoresistance to gefitinib in HCC827
cell lines (Figure 5F). Our results suggested that miR-30e
sensitized HCC827/GR cells to gefitinib.

miR-30e mimics or inhibitorinto PC9G or PC9 cells;
interestingly,cells co-transfected withmiR-30e mimics
and wild-type HOXA1 3’UTR showeda significant
decrease in luciferase activity, whilemiR-30e-inhibitor
significantlyincreasedthe luciferase activity. However,
in the mutant group, no detectablechange in luciferase
activity was observed (Figure 6A–6B),suggesting that
miR-30e suppressed thetranscription activity of the
HOXA1 gene by targeting the putative3’UTR of HOXA1
mRNA independently. Western blot demonstrated that
HOXA1 protein amounts were reduced in miR-30e treated
PC9G cells, and increasedafter miR-30e-inhibition in
PC9 cells (Figure 6C). Furthermore, HOXA1amounts
were assessed in human lung cancersamples and adjacent
normal tissue specimens, with markedly increased
values found in cancer specimens (Figure 6D). Next, the
association ofHOXA1content with miR-30e amounts in
human lung cancer specimens was assessed by Spearman’s
rank correlation. Interestingly, HOXA1content and
miR-30e levels were inversely correlated in human lung
cancer specimens (Spearman’s correlation r = –0.5382)
(Figure 6E). These data demonstrated that miR-30e
directly targeted HOXA1 in lung cancer cells.

HOXA1 is a direct target of miR-30e
To explore the underlying mechanism of miR-30e in
lung cancer, the database TargetScan (www.targetscan.org)
was searched. We found that miR-30e likely regulates the
HOXA1 gene sinceits 3’‑UTR harbored the binding site
for the seed region of miR-30e.HOXA1 has a critical
function in normal tissue growth and differentiation. Based
on the putative binding site of miR-30e in the 3’UTR of
the HOXA1 gene,we initially constructed two types of
plasmids containingthe luciferase reporting gene with
wild-type or mutantHOXA1 3’UTR, and co-transfected

alterations, including the induction of oncogenes and/
or suppression of tumor suppressors. Altered miRNA
expression is commonly found in human carcinomas,
e.g. NSCLC [23, 24]. Here, the role of miR-30e in lung
carcinoma was evaluated, as well as the underlying
molecular mechanisms.
Mounting evidence suggests that miR-30e is a
potential tumor suppressor in multiple cancers. As shown
above,reduced miR-30e levelswere obtained in lung cancer
specimens, in comparison with adjacent non-cancerous
tissue samples. The expression of miR-30e was reduced in
the resistantlung carcinoma PC9G cell line in comparison
with PC9 cells.In agreement, miR-30e overexpression
resulted in decreased cell growth and migration, while
inducingapoptosis in PC9G cells; conversely miR-30e
repression markedly promoted cell growth and migration,
and inhibited apoptosis in PC9 cells. This study is the first
to reveal miR-30e overexpression in chemosensitivity.
These findings could help developnovel therapeutic
strategies for lung carcinoma treatment.
HOXA1, a member of the HOXA family which
wasfirst identified in Drosophila, has been previously
reported to significantly influence the normal growth
and differentiationof mammalian tissues [25, 26].
HOXA1 re-expression in human mammary epithelial
cells was shown to cause oncogenic transformation

To evaluate the function of miR-30e in
canceraggressiveness in vivo, PC9G/miR-NC and PC9G/
miR-30e cells were subcutaneously administered into
both posterior flanks of male BALB/c nude mice. The
formed tumors were measured every other day;gefitinib
was administered by peritoneal injection. Interestingly,
MiR-30e decreased tumor volumes and weights
compared with the miR-NC group, and miR-30e plus
gefitinibresulted in decreased tumor volumes and weights
compared with miR-30e (Figure 7A–7C). To explore the
molecular mechanisms by which miR-30e affects tumor
growth, total protein samples were obtained for Western
blot; as expected,HOXA1 protein amounts were reduced
in miR-30eexpressing tumors (Figure 7D). These findings
suggested that miR-30e enhanced lung cancer sensitivity
to gefitinib in nude mice.

DISCUSSION
MicroRNAs have significant functions in
carcinogenesis, with some correlated with clinical
characteristics and outcomes [22]. Meanwhile,lung
cancertumorigenesis involves both genetic and epigenetic

and tumorigenesis in vivo [27]. HOXA1 mutation
results in decreased mammary cell proliferation,
anchorageindependentgrowth, and loss of contact
inhibition [28]. In addition, HOXA1 expression levels in
squamous cell lung-and cervical cancer tissue samples
are significantly elevated compared with adjacent normal
tissue specimens [19, 29]. Here, the HOXA1 oncogene
was further identified as anew miR-30e target both in vitro
and in mice. First, luciferase reporter assay demonstrated
that miR-30e directly recognized the 3′-UTR of HOXA1
mRNA. In addition, HOXA1 levels were significantly
reduced after stable miR-30e expression. Thirdly,
HOXA1 and miR-30ewere inversely correlated in clinical
specimens. Taken together, these findings indicated that
HOXA1 is anew miR-30e target.
MicroRNAs are considered to be involved in
cancer chemoresistance; indeed, they are differentially
expressed in chemo-sensitive and chemoresistant cells
[30–32]. Interestingly, ectopic miR-34a was shown to
sensitizecolorectal carcinoma cells to 5-fluorouracil [33];
meanwhile,miR-497 reduces tumor cell proliferation and
sensitizes to 5-fluorouracil by inactivating KSR1 [34],
and targets N-RAS to increase temozolomide-dependent
apoptosis in  gliomas [35]. As shown above,miR-30e

enhances chemosensitivity togefitinib, bothin vitro
and in vivo, confirmingthatmiR-30e re-expression
may constitute a novel strategy forovercoming
chemoresistance to gefitinib in lung cancer. However,
the majority of clinical samples did not undergoEGFR
mutationassessmentbecause
most
patients
were
administeredgefitinib after unsuccessful chemotherapy
and diseaseprogression. Thisis alimitation if this study.
Therefore, it remains unclear whether theobserved
response may be due to EGFR-mutations. We then
retrospectively assessed samples with EGFR-mutation,
which also showedelevatedmiR-30e amounts. These
findings indicated that elevated miR-30e amounts may
overlap to some extentwith EGFR-mutation,which is
a very well-known predictive marker of response to
EGFR-TKIs. Further research is required to testthis
hypothesis.
In summary,the current findingsfirstly demonstrated
that miR-30e played a significant role in suppressing lung
cancer cell growth through HOXA1inhibition. Although
we confirmed that miR-30e could inhibit lung cancer by
targeting HOXA1, there might be other miR-30etargets,
which could also affect tumor growth in lung cancer.
Therefore, further studies are warranted for identifying

in HEK-293T cells using polybrene (Sigma-Aldrich);
selection was performed by treatment with puromycin
(Sigma-Aldrich) for 2 weeks, to yield stablecell lines.

CCK-8 reagent was supplemented per well and further
incubated for 1–2 h. Absorbance was read at 450 nm.

RNA purification and real-time reverse
transcription polymerase chain reaction
(qRT-PCR)

The effects of miR-30e on cell migrationwere
investigated in 24-wellMatrigel invasion chambers (BD
Biosciences, UK) as instructed by the manufacturer.
Transfected cells (5 × 104) were plated in upper wells in
serum-free RPMI-1640, with RPMI-1640 containing 10%
FBS in lower chambers. After 16-20 h, non-invading cells
(top wells) were removed; invasive cells (bottom wells)
were submitted to staining with 0.1% crystal violet after
fixation (paraformaldehyde). Photomicrographs were
captured in 3 randomly selected high power fields. After
air drying, the membranes were treated with 33% acetic
acid (300 µL/well) at room temperature for 15 minutes,
and the resulting solutions transferred into 96-well plates.
Absorbance at a wavelength of 570 nm was recorded.

Migration assay

Total RNA was obtained from cultured cells with
TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, USA) as instructed by the
manufacturer. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR detecting
mature miR-30e was carried out in triplicate with RT
Reagent Kit (Vazyme, Nanjing, China) as directed by the
manufacturer, withAceQ SYBR Master Mix (Vazyme,
Nanjing, China) on a 7900HT system. MicroRNA-30e
levels in each group were determined relative to U6
amounts, by the 2-∆∆Ct) method.

Luciferase reporter assay
TargetScan was employed to predict miR-30e
binding sites. A fragment of the 3′-UTR of HOXA1
with the putative miR-30e binding site was cloned
by PCR. To generate a construct harboring mutated
miR-30e binding site, four nucleotides corresponding
to the 5′-seeding region of this site were substituted in
the wild type fragment. The complementary fragment
in the 3′-UTR of HOXA1 (UGUUUAC) was mutated
to UCAUAUC. PCR products were cut with SacI and
HindIII, cloned inserted into pMIR-REPORTER, and
validated by DNA sequencing. Constructs were then
co-transfected with miR-30e or miR-NC into HEK-293
cells in 24-well plates for 24 h, followed by Luciferase
assays with Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay System
(Promega, WI, USA).
