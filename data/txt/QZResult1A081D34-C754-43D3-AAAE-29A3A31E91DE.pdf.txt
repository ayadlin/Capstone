ABSTRACT
The sonic hedgehog (Shh) pathway is highly activated in thyroid neoplasms and
promotes thyroid cancer stem-like cell phenotype, but whether the Shh pathway
regulates thyroid tumor cell motility and invasiveness remains unknown. Here,
we report that the motility and invasiveness of two anaplastic thyroid tumor cell
lines, KAT-18 and SW1736, were inhibited by two inhibitors of the Shh pathway
(cyclopamine and GANT61). Consistently, the cell motility and invasiveness was
decreased by Shh and Gli1 knockdown, and was increased by Gli1 overexpression in
KAT-18 cells. Mechanistic studies revealed that Akt and c-Met phosphorylation was
decreased by a Gli1 inhibitor and by Shh and Gli1 knockdown, but was increased by
Gli1 overexpression. LY294002, a PI-3 kinase inhibitor, and a c-Met inhibitor inhibited
the motility and invasiveness of Gli1-transfected KAT-18 cells more effectively than
the vector-transfected cells. Knockdown of Snail, a transcription factor regulated
by the Shh pathway, led to decreased cell motility and invasiveness in KAT-18 and
SW1736 cells. However, key epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers
including E-cadherin and vimentin as well as Slug were not affected by cyclopamine
and GANT61 in either SW1736 or WRO82, a well differentiated follicular thyroid
carcinoma cell line. Our data suggest that the Shh pathway-stimulated thyroid tumor
cell motility and invasiveness is largely mediated by AKT and c-Met activation with
little involvement of EMT.

INTRODUCTION

from activating a family of oncogenic Gli transcription
factors. Hedgehog binding to Patched leads to the
uncoupling of Patched from Smo, subsequently leading to
the activation of a signal cascade and the translocation of
Gli into the nucleus to induce or repress gene expression
[1-3].
The sonic hedgehog signaling pathway has been
implicated in stimulating tumor cell motility and invasion

In mammals, the hedgehog pathway is regulated by
three ligands: Sonic hedgehog (Shh), Indian hedgehog,
and Desert hedgehog. In the absence of these ligands, the
Shh pathway is inactive since the transmembrane receptor,
Patched (Ptch) functions as a tumor suppressor to prevent
Smoothened (Smo), a G-protein coupled receptor [1-3]

in several types of malignancies [3]. One of the Gli1regulated genes, SNAIL, can function as a transcription
repressor for E-cadherin [4]. Loss of E-cadherin is a
hallmark of the epithelial to mesenchymal transition
(EMT). Intriguingly, Gli1 can directly bind the E-cadherin
promoter and induce its expression [5, 6]. Whether the
Shh pathway stimulates tumor cell invasiveness through
EMT remains controversial. In addition, the Shh pathway
may promote tumor cell invasiveness by cross-activating
the PI-3 kinase pathway or induces metalloproteinase
expression [7-15]. Disregulated Shh signaling correlates
with the severity of the associated tumor and contributes
to maintain metastatic behavior. Understanding the crosstalk between the Shh and other pathways will facilitate
the discovery of novel therapeutics and the treatment of
metastatic disease.
Improved understanding of genetic alterations such
as identification of high frequency BRAF gene mutations
in thyroid cancer offers new hope for promising target
therapy. Undifferentiated anaplastic thyroid carcinoma
(ATC) is almost always fatal, with a mean survival of
6 months [16]. However, significant challenges remain
as drug resistance arises due to the transactivation of
other signaling pathways or new gene mutations in the
same pathway. Recent studies have identified thyroid
cancer stem cells (CSCs) as a unique population (about
1-3%) that is highly tumorigenic and metastatic. Poorly
differentiated or undifferentiated thyroid cancers contain
a higher percentage of ALDH (aldehyde dehyrogenase)positive CSCs than benign adenomas and well
differentiated thyroid cancers. CSC-enriched ATC is
highly invasive and metastatic due to hyperactivation
of the PI-3 kinase pathway and c-Met [17, 18]. We and
others have demonstrated that the Shh pathway is widely
activated in thyroid neoplasm and promotes thyroid tumor
cell proliferation [19-22]. Our further studies showed
that the Shh pathway promotes the cancer stem-like cell
phenotype of two anaplastic thyroid carcinoma cell lines,
KAT-18 and SW1736 [23]. Here we report that the Shh
pathway plays an important role in the tumor cell motility
and invasiveness of anaplastic thyroid cancer cell lines by
activating c-Met and AKT.

24% and 66%, respectively. Cyclopamine and GANT61
inhibited the motility of SW1736 cells by 73% and
79%, respectively, and inhibited the invasive potential
of SW1736 cells by 47% and 38%, respectively (Figure
1B). According to our prior study [19], SW1736 cells are
resistant to the anti-proliferative effect of cyclopamine,
whereas KAT-18 cells are sensitive to cyclopamine,
with the inhibition of cell proliferation by 50% after
incubation 96 hr. The inhibitory effect of cyclopamine
and GANT61 on cell motility and invasiveness was not
due to their inhibitory effect on cell proliferation since
the experiments were carried out overnight, the antiproliferative effect after such a short duration is minimal
and almost neglectable, in particular for SW1736 cells.
KAT-18 and SW1736 cells were readily attached onto
the uncoated or Matrigel-coated inserts in the absence or
presence of cyclopamine or GANT61 2 hr after seeding.
Neither cyclopamine nor GANT61 interfered with the
adhesion of these two cell lines.
We reported earlier that two miRNA constructs
targeting Shh and Gli1 were very effective at suppressing
Shh and Gli1 expression in either transiently [19] or stably
[23] transfected KAT-18 cells. We repeated Western blot
analysis and again demonstrated the ability of these
miRNA constructs to suppress Shh and Gli1 in KAT-18
cells stably transfected with these miRNA constructs
(Figure 2A). Consistent with our earlier observation
[23] , we found that Shh knockdown in KAT-18 cells
stably transfected with Shh-miRNA led to a modest
decrease of Gli1 expression, probably due to an autocrine
regulation by the Shh pathway (Figure 2A). Our recent
study demonstrated the ability of pcDNA/Gli1 vector to
overexpress Gli1 in stably transfected KAT-18 cells [23].
Again we confirmed Gli1 overexpression in pcDNA/Gli1transfected KAT-18 cells (Figure 2B). Cell motility of
Shh-miRNA- and Gli1-miRNA-transfected KAT-18 cells
was decreased by 47% and 42%, respectively, and their
invasive potential reduced by 76% and 53%, respectively
(Figure 2C). In contrast, Gli1 overexpression in pcDNA/
Gli1-transfected KAT-18 cells led to increased cell
motility and invasiveness by 43% and 560%, respectively
(Figure 2D).

Effect of the Shh pathway on thyroid tumor cell
motility and invasiveness

The Shh pathway is implicated in promoting the
cancer stem-like cell type of anaplastic thyroid cancer cell
lines [23]. c-Met and AKT are highly phosphorylated and
activated in invasive thyroid CSC [17]. Here we tested
whether inhibition of the Shh pathway by two inhibitors
led to decreased c-Met and AKT phosphorylation.
Cyclopamine had little effect on c-Met and AKT
phosphorylation in KAT-18 (Figure 3A) but did inhibit

We first examined the effect of cyclopamine, a Smo
inhibitor, and GANT61, a Gli1 inhibitor, on the motility
and invasiveness of KAT-18 and SW1736 cells. As shown
in Figure 1A, cyclopamine and GANT61 decreased
KAT-18 cell motility by 54% and 76%, respectively,
and inhibited the invasive potential of KAT-18 cells by

in KAT-18 and SW1736 cells (Figure 3A and 3B). Shh and

and inhibited the motility and invasive potential of Gli1transfected KAT-18 cells by 78% and 77% respectively
(Figure 4G). LY294002, an AKT inhibitor, decreased the
motility and invasiveness of pcDNA-transfected KAT-18
cells by 60% and 27% respectively, and the motility and
invasive potential of Gli1-transfected KAT-18 cells by
64% and 61%, respectively (Figure 4H). Of note, c-Met
inhibitor III weakly inhibited KAT-18 cell migration but
did not significantly inhibit invasiveness (Figure 4G). This
is likely due to low basal level c-Met phosphorylation and
activation in KAT-18 cells (Figure 6B)

expression (Figure 6D) in KAT-18 cells. Cyclopamine
and GANT61 all drastically inhibited Snail expression in
a dose-dependent manner in SW1736 cells (Figure 6E) but
had relatively weak effect on WRO82 cells, probably due
to very low level of Snail expression. These inhibitors had
no or minimal effect on E-cadherin, Vimentin, and Slug
expression in SW1736 and WRO82 cells (Figure 6E and
6F).

DISCUSSION
Our present study showed that inhibition of the
Shh pathway by Smo and Gli1 inhibitors or by Shh
and Gli1 knockdown led to decreased cell motility and
chemoinvasion in KAT-18 and SW1736 cells, whereas
Gli1 overexpression enhanced KAT-18 motility and
invasive potential. AKT and c-Met phosphorylation was
increased in Gli1-transfected KAT-18 cells but decreased
in KAT-18 cells with Shh and Gli1 knockdown. c-Met
inhibitor III and the AKT inhibitor LY294002 decreased
cell motility and invasiveness of Gli1-transfected cells.
In particular, c-Met inhibitor III was more effective at
inhibiting cell migration and invasion in Gli1-transfected
than pcDNA3.1-transfected KAT-18 cells, probably as a
result of increased c-Met activation in Gli1-transfected
cells (Figure 4A). Our studies suggest that the Shh
pathway promotes thyroid tumor cell motility and
invasiveness by activating AKT and c-Met. Of note, our
prior clinical study did not reveal a correlation between
the Shh pathway activation and the invasive potential
of thyroid cancer [19]. This is likely due to the noncanonical activation of Gli1 by other pathways such as
the MAP kinase pathway due to RAS and BRAF gene
mutations [26]. In addition, the activation of the PI-3
and MAP kinase pathways also induces the expression
of thrombospondin-1 and EMT-related genes to promote
tumor invasion [27-29]. Myopericytoma, a rare tumor
with a phenotype of pluripotent stem-cell-like pericytes,
is also highly aggressive with recurrent disease [30].
Targeting mutant B-Raf kinase in myopericytoma leads to
the inhibition of cell migration, invasion, and angiogenesis
[30].
Smo functions as a G protein-coupled receptor.
Activation of Gβγ leads to the activation of PI-3
kinase, whereas inhibition of adenylyl cyclase leads
to the inhibition of PKA and in part the activation
of Gli1 (Figure 7) [11]. Indeed, N-Shh induces AKT
phosphorylation in esophageal and gastric cancer cell lines
[10, 31]. Cyclopamine inhibits AKT phosphorylation in
hepacellular [13], esophageal [31], and gastric [10, 31]
cancer cell lines. Similar to these observations, our study
showed that Shh/Gli1 knockdown and GANT61 were
very effective in suppressing AKT phosphorylation in
KAT-18 and SW1736 cells, whereas Gli1 overexpression
increased AKT phosphorylation in KAT-18 cells.
Unexpectedly, we found that cyclopamine inhibited Gli1

Role of Snail in thyroid tumor cell motility and
invasiveness
Since Snail is tightly regulated by the Shh pathway,
and Snail has been implicated in tumor cell metastasis in
an EMT-dependent and –independent manner [24, 25], we
tested if Snail was involved in regulating thyroid tumor
cell motility and invasiveness. As shown in Figure 5A,
Snail expression was effectively suppressed in KAT18 and SW1736 cells transfected with Snail siRNA.
Unexpectedly, Snail knockdown had no or little inhibitory
effect on E-cadherin expression. Snail knockdown
decreased KAT-18 cell motility and invasiveness by 15%
and 50%, respectively (Figure 5B), and more effectively
decreased SW1736 cell motility and invasiveness by
83% and 67%, respectively (Figure 5C). The differential
sensitivity of KAT-18 and SW1736 cells to Snail
suppression-mediated inhibition of cell motility and
invasiveness is likely due to differential Snail expression
in these two cell lines (Figure 6A).

Role of the Shh pathway in EMT
We first tested if the Snail levels in 5 thyroid tumor
cell lines inversely correlated with E-cadherin expression.
Western blot analysis revealed that E-cadherin was
expressed at high levels in WRO82 cells but at very
low levels in four other cell lines (KAT-18, SW1736,
TPC1, and BCPAP) (Figure 6A). Snail was expressed at
relatively low levels in WRO82 cells but was expressed
in four other cell lines, in particular in SW1736 cells.
AKT was highly phosphorylated at S473 in KAT-18
cells, whereas c-Met tyrosine phosphorylation was very
low in this cell line (Figure 6B). It appears that there
was no correlation between Snail expression and AKT/cMet phosphorylation (Figure 6A and 6B). Suppression
of the Shh pathway by Shh and Gli1 knockdown
weakly increased E-cadherin expression, whereas Gli1
overexpression slightly decreased E-cadherin expression
(Figure 6C). Unexpectedly, cyclopamine and GANT61
slightly decreased or had no effect on E-cadherin

expression but had little effect on AKT phosphorylation
in KAT-18 and SW1736 cells (Figure 3A and 3B).
How cyclopamine lacked the inhibitory effect on AKT
phosphorylation is puzzling. One explanation is that many
chemotherapeutic drugs are capable of activating the PI-3
and/or MAP kinase pathways [32]. It is not clear whether
cyclopamine, a Smo inhibitor, may activate the PI-3 kinase
pathway, thus counteracting its inhibitory effect on AKT
phosphorylation mediated through inhibiting the Shh
pathway. A second possibility is that Gli1 activation is
responsible for AKT phosphorylation. Blocking the Smo
activity by cyclopamine cannot prevent non-canonical
Gli1 activation. Therefore a Smo inhbitor cannot, whereas
a Gli1 inhibitor can inhibit AKT phosphorylation. In
support of this notion, Srivastava et al. [15] recently
reported that GANT61 inhibits AKT phosphorylation in

embryonal and alveolar rhabdomyosarcomas.
We noticed that E-cadherin expression was not
consistently regulated under different experimental
settings. For example, overexpression of Gli in KAT18 cells led to increased Snail expression and decreased
E-cadherin expression. In contrast, Snail knockdown by
siRNA did not increase E-cadherin expression in KAT-18
cells (Figure 5A). There are several explanations for this
discrepancy: 1) basal level of Snail expression in KAT18 cells was relatively low (Figure 6A). Indeed, Snail
knockdown only weakly inhibited KAT-18 cell motility
and invasiveness (Figure 5B); 2) Snail suppression by
siRNA is transient and incomplete; 3) The E-cadherin
promoter is probably highly methylated in anaplastic cell
lines [33-35]. Transient suppression of Snail by siRNA is
not sufficient to induce E-cadherin expression.

Figure 7: Mechanisms of the Shh pathway-induced cell motility and invasiveness. The binding of Shh to the 12-pass

transmembrane receptor Ptch leads to the translocation and activation of Smo, a G protein-coupled receptor. Smo activates Gli1 through
inhibiting SUFU, an inhibitors of Gli1. In addition, Smo activation also leads to the formation of the Gβ and Gγ heterodimer, which activates
the PI-3-kinase pathway. AKT activation leads to cytoskeleton remodeling and cell motility. Snail expression can be transcriptionally
induced by Gli1. The Shh pathway may also contribute to increased invasiveness by converting cells to cancer stem-like cell phenotype
and c-Met activation.

We also noticed that drug treatment did not
recapitulate the effect of Shh and Gli1 knockdown on
E-cadherin expression. There are several explanations
again: 1) E-cadherin promoter is highly methylated [3335]. Chronic stable expression of miRNAs that knock
down Shh or Gli1 may alter the methylation status of
the E-cadherin promoter. In contrast, drug treatments,
similar to Snail siRNA, have only transient effect. 2)
Nonspecificity of drugs: CP and GANT61, when used
at a low concentration, actually increased E-cadherin
expression. When they were used at high concentrations,
their inhibitory effect on E-cadherin expression could be
due to their off-target effect; 3) Regulation of E-cadherin
expression is complex. Gli1 and Snail can positively and
negatively regulate its promoter activity. Nevertheless, our
data consistently showed that stable suppression of Shh
and Gli1 expression with miRNA constructs increased
E-cadherin expression, whereas Gli1 overexpression
in pcDNA/Gli1 stably tranfected cells increased Snail
expression and inhibited E-cadherin expression.
The mechanisms by which the Shh pathway
stimulates cell motility and invasiveness are complex.
Our present study demonstrated that AKT phosphorylation
was increased by Gli1 overexpression and decreased by
GANT61 or by Shh and Gli1 knockdown in KAT-18 cells.
It is well established that Akt phosphorylates several
cytoskeleton proteins such as filamin A, pappadin, and
vimentin, and that the PI-3 kinase pathway stimulates
cell motility in part by cytoskeleton remodeling [36].
Moreover, inhibition of PI-3 kinase by LY294002 led to
the inhibition of thyroid tumor cell motility and invasion
(Figure 4). We conclude that activation of the PI-3 kinase
pathway plays a dominant role in the Shh pathwayinduced cell motility and invasiveness. Consistent with
our observations, inhibition of the PI-3 kinase pathway
blocks the Shh-pathway-induced tumor cell invasiveness
and metastasis of gastric cancer cells [37].
The Shh pathway may also promote tumor cell
motility and invasiveness by inducing EMT, a cellular
process best characterized by decreased expression
of E-cadherin and increased expression of vimentin,
fibronectin and N-cadherin. The Shh pathway promotes
EMT by inducing Snail expression, leading to E-cadherin
expression [38, 39]. For example, the Shh pathway
induces EMT in ovarian and pancreatic cancers [40]
[5]. Intriguingly, Gli1 itself is able to induce E-cadherin
expression through the Gli1-binding site in the E-cadherin
promoter [5, 6]. Thus, E-cadherin can be positively
regulated by Gli1 but negatively regulated by Snail. The
effect of the Shh pathway on E-cadherin expression is
subject to the balance of Gli1 and Snail regulation. Our
present study revealed that E-cadherin expression was
weakly regulated in KAT-18 cells when the Shh pathway
was persistently suppressed or activated through a genetic
approach but minimally regulated in three thyroid tumor
cell lines by transient inhibition with cyclopamine
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

and GANT61. Liao et al. made similar observations
in a SCOV3 ovarian cancer cell line [5]. In addition,
we found that the Shh pathway had little effect on the
expression of several other EMT-related genes such as
vimentin, N-cadherin, and fibronectin. These results
suggest that blockade of the Shh pathway was unable
to reverse EMT in two anaplastic cell lines, and that
the Shh pathway-induced cell motility and invasiveness
is largely independent of EMT. Whether Shh pathway
activation induces EMT in normal thyrocytes and in
well differentiated thyroid tumor cell lines remains to be
determined.
Todardo et al. [17] reported that c-Met is highly
activated in thyroid cancer stem cells, and that inhibition
of c-Met by gene knockdown significantly inhibits thyroid
cancer stem cell motility and invasion. Our earlier study
showed that SW1736 cells contain a much higher percent
of thyroid cancer stem-like cells than that in KAT-18 cells
[23]. In our present study, we found that cyclopamine had
little effect on c-Met phosphorylation in KAT-18 cells but
inhibited c-Met phosphorylation in SW1736 cells (Figure
3). Moreover, we found that c-Met inhibitor III had little
effect on the migration and invasion of untransfected KAT18 cells but inhibited the migration and invasions of Gli1transfected KAT-18 cells (Figure 4). Lack of inhibitory
effect by cyclopamine on c-Met phosphorylation and
lack of inhibitory effect by the Met kinase inhibitor III
on cell migration and invasion was likely due to lower
c-Met expression (Figure 6) and lower percent of cancer
stem-like cells in KAT-18 cells than that in SW1736
cells [23]. In contrast, we found that stable suppression
of Shh expression in Shh-miRNA-transfected KAT-18
cells significantly decreased c-Met expression, whereas
stable overexpression of Gli1 significantly increased
c-Met expression. Differential effect of cyclopamine and
Shh knockdown on c-Met and AKT activation as well as
on E-cadherin expression could be due to the off-target
effect of CP. Alternatively, stable suppression of the Shh
pathway by gene knockdown may lead to c-Met and
E-cadherin promoter demethylation.
In addition to its effect on EMT, Snail is capable of
stimulating tumor cell motility and invasion by inducing
the expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP).
For example, Snail overexpression in pancreatic ductal
adenocarcinomas increases tumor cell invasiveness by
increasing the expression of MMP-14 and membrane type
(MT)-1-MMP [41, 42]. Activation of the Shh pathway
induces the expression of MMP-9 in pancreatic cancer cell
lines [37] and MT1-MMP expression in ovarian cancer
cell lines [5]. Our recent and present studies demonstrated
the ability of the Shh pathway to regulate Snail expression,
and Snail suppression inhibited KAT-18 and SW1736 cell
motility and invasiveness. Thus, the Shh pathway may
also stimulate thyroid tumor cell motility and invasiveness

In summary, our present study showed that the

Shh pathway was involved in activating the PI-3 kinase
pathway and promoting the motility and invasiveness of
two anaplastic thyroid cancer cell lines. We further showed
that Snail and the activation of the PI-3 kinase pathway
as well as c-Met played a critical role in mediating the
Shh pathway-induced thyroid tumor cell motility and
invasiveness. The inhibitors of the Shh pathway may have
potential to be developed as novel anti-thyroid cancer
drugs to control anaplastic thyroid CSC-like phenotype,
tumor invasiveness and metastasis.

Cell lysates were prepared as described [23] and
analyzed for the expression of AKT, phospho-AKTS473,
c-Met tyrosine phosphorylation at Y1230/1234/1235, Gli1,
Snail, Slug, Vimentin, and E-cadherin (Cell Signaling
Biotechnology, Inc., Danvers, MA). For loading control,
β-actin was detected by a mouse monoclonal antibody
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., San Diego, CA). The
density of the bands was analyzed by using an Image-J
software and normalized by actin. The results were
the mean ± standard deviation from three independent
experiments.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell lines and plasmid DNA

Statistical analysis

WRO82, KAT-18 and SW1736 cell lines were
authenticated and reported earlier [19, 23]. Characteristics
and stable transfection of KAT-18 cells with miRNAs
targeting Shh and Gli1 or with Gli1 overexpression have
been recently reported [23]. The passages of the three
cell lines used in our studies are: WRO82 between 80-95
passages; KAT-18 between 28 and 40 passages; SW1736
between 10-25 passages.

The differences in the number of the cells migrating
through the PET membrane between different treatment
groups were statistically analyzed by using an unpaired
Student t test. A p value of <0.05 was considered
statistically significant. All statistics was performed with
SigmaPlot 11 software (Systat Software, Inc, San Jose,
CA).

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

Cell motility and chemoinvasion assay

We thank Drs. Guy J. F. Juillard (University of
California at Los Angeles) and Kenneth B. Ain (University
of Kentucky Medical Center, Lexington, KY) for kindly
providing three thyroid tumor cell lines, Dr. Tsutomu
Kume (Northwestern University Feinberg School of
Medicine) for pcDNA/Gli1 plasmid.

Single cell suspensions of KAT-18 and SW1736
cells were prepared and seeded in the top chamber of
the 24-well Transwell inserts (2x104/well) in serum-free
medium supplemented with 0.1% bovine serum albumin.
For the chemoinvasion assay, the inserts were pre-coated
with Matrigel (100 µg/well; Roche Diagnostics Corp.,
Indianapolis, IN). The Transwell inserts were placed in a
24-well companion plate filled with 0.75 ml of complete
RPMI1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum.
To analyze the effect of PI-3 kinase and c-Met inhibitors
on cell motility and invasive potential, LY294002 (10
µM) (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA), or
c-Met inhibitor III (5 µM) (EMD Millipore, Billerica,
MA) was added into both top and bottom chambers.
After incubation for 24 h, the cells in the inner side of
top chamber were removed by wiping with cotton swabs.
The effect of cyclopamine (LC Laboratories, Woburn,
MA), a Smo inhibitor, and GANT61 (Sigma, St. Louis,
MO), a Gli1 inhibitor, on cell motility and invasiveness
were similarly conducted. Snail knockdown was carried
out as described [23] and similarly analyzed for its effect
on thyroid tumor cell motility and invasiveness, The
cells that migrated through uncoated or Matrigel-coated
polyethylene terephthalate (PET) membranes were stained
with a Diff-Quik kit (Mercedes Medical, Sarasota, FL).
The membrane was sliced out, mounted on slides and
sealed with the mounting media. The cells in five random
fields (10X) were counted under a light microscope.
