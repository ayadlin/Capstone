BACKGROUND: A rapid and early monoclonal (M) protein response during initial therapy in patients with multiple
myeloma had been identified as a predictor of superior long-term outcome in some—but not all—studies. METHODS:
To determine if the parameter of M protein reduction was of value in the relapsed and/or refractory setting, retrospective landmark analyses were performed at the end of cycles 2 and 4 of a phase 3 study, which randomized such
patients to receive bortezomib alone or pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) with bortezomib. RESULTS: Compared with a <25% reduction in M protein at the landmark time point, patients with a 50% to <75% reduction after
cycle 2 had a significantly lower hazard ratio (HR) for time to progression (HR ¼ 0.41; 95% confidence interval [CI],
0.26-0.64; P <.001), as did those with a 75% reduction (HR ¼ 0.26; 95% CI, 0.15-0.45; P < .001). In all of these
groups, PLD þ bortezomib provided superior outcomes to bortezomib alone, and did so without an increase in the
risk of adverse events overall and with a predictable toxicity profile. CONCLUSIONS: These analyses supported the
possibility that a robust early M protein response is a good prognostic factor for long-term outcome of myeloma
patients with relapsed and/or refractory disease receiving bortezomib or PLD þ bortezomib. Cancer 2011;117:3758–

Approximately 20,180 new cases of multiple myeloma will be diagnosed in the United States during 2010, and

approximately 10,650 people will die of the disease during the same period.1 In part due to the availability of new therapies
for multiple myeloma, 5-year survival rates and median survival have increased substantially over the past several decades.
The latter, for example, has improved from approximately 2 to 3 years from the time of diagnosis in 1985 through 1998, to
approximately 5 to 7 years for patients diagnosed in 2005.2,3 Although multiple myeloma remains incurable, novel and
rationally designed regimens such as pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD; DOXILV) and the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib (VELCADEV) appear to be improving outcomes in patients with relapsed and/or refractory disease as well. Indeed,
in a phase 3 randomized trial comparing PLD þ bortezomib with bortezomib alone in this patient population, PLD þ bortezomib improved time to progression (TTP) from 6.5 months with bortezomib alone, to 9.3 months in patients treated
with the combination.4 Moreover, therapy with PLD þ bortezomib improved the complete plus very good partial response
rate, the response duration, the progression-free survival, and the overall survival compared with single agent bortezomib.

M Protein Reduction With Chemotherapy/Shah et al

Prognostic factors, such as advanced age, low serum
albumin, greater number of prior therapies, and increased
b2-microglobulin (b2M) levels have been recognized to
unfavorably affect treatment outcomes in both front-line
and relapsed settings and impact subsequent treatment
choices.5 Other factors may also influence the choice of salvage therapy in relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma,
including various disease characteristics such as the monoclonal (M) protein burden. Several studies have suggested
that there is a positive relationship between rapidity of
response, as measured by the reduction in M protein, and
outcomes in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma. For example, Ross et al noted that those patients
who achieved at least a partial response after 1 cycle of infusional vincristine and doxorubicin with oral dexamethasone
(VAD) had a superior event-free survival compared with
those with lesser quality responses.6 Similarly, Schaar et al
reported that at least a 30% reduction in the M protein,
and especially a 40% reduction after 1 cycle of melphalan
and prednisone (MP), predicted for superior survival.7
Thus, an early response to induction therapy in multiple
myeloma may benefit long-term outcome measures and
may result in an improvement in symptom burden. To
investigate the possibility that a relationship between rapid
response and outcomes is also present in the relapsed and/
or refractory setting, we retrospectively evaluated the impact
of an early reduction in the M protein in the phase 3 trial of
PLD þ bortezomib versus bortezomib alone in patients
with relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma.4

METHODS
Study Treatment and Endpoints
Full details of the primary study design, protocol, and
treatment have been previously described.4 Briefly,
patients naı̈ve to bortezomib who had measurable disease,
had progressed after 1 line of therapy, or were refractory
to initial treatment were randomized after stratification by
b2M levels and response to initial therapy. The intent-totreat (ITT) population received PLD at 30 mg/m2 as a 1hour or longer intravenous (IV) infusion on Day 4 and
bortezomib at 1.3 mg/m2 on Days 1, 4, 8, and 11 of every
21-day cycle (n ¼ 324), or bortezomib alone at the same
dose and schedule (n ¼ 322). Treatment continued until
disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurred or
for 8 cycles, although patients who were still responding
after 8 cycles could continue, provided that treatment was
tolerated. The primary efficacy endpoint was the TTP,
and secondary endpoints included response rate and
safety. Assessments of the latter included adverse event

reports, changes in clinical laboratory findings, and cardiac function tests (multiple gated acquisition scan/echocardiogram/electrocardiogram).
Post-hoc Landmark Analyses of M Protein
(Early Response)
The percentage decrease from baseline in M protein was
evaluated post-hoc using landmark analyses at the end of
cycles 2 and 4. Patients were categorized into 4 groups by
reduction in M protein at the landmark time points.
Patients included in the landmark analyses must have: 1)
had baseline M protein 1.0; 2) had end of cycle 2 (or
cycle 4) M protein data; 3) had dose intensity >0 for cycle
2 (or cycle 4); and 4) not progressed or been censored by
study day used for M protein data at end of cycle 2 (or
cycle 4). Using a Cox proportional hazard model, TTP
was evaluated by treatment and by the 3 groups with
25% M protein reduction compared with the group
with <25% M protein reduction.

RESULTS
A total of 199 patients receiving PLD þ bortezomib and
205 patients receiving bortezomib alone were included in
the landmark analysis at the end of cycle 2, while 116
patients receiving PLD þ bortezomib and 129 patients
receiving bortezomib alone were included in the landmark
analysis at the end of cycle 4. Because our interest was
focused on the early responders, the results below focus on
the landmark analyses at the end of cycle 2.
Efficacy
Regardless of the treatment assignment, a decrease in the
risk of TTP was observed in patients with a greater reduction in M protein (Table 1). At the cycle 2 landmark analysis, the risk reduction was significant for the 50-<75%
M protein reduction group (approximately a 60% risk
reduction) and for the 75% M protein reduction group
(approximately a 75% risk reduction). At the cycle 4 landmark analysis, the risk reduction was significant for the
75% M protein reduction group (approximately a 60%
risk reduction). PLD þ bortezomib continued to be significantly superior to bortezomib alone at cycle 2 and
cycle 4, even after adjusting for the % decrease in M protein. TTP was longer as M protein decreased at the end of
cycle 2 and was improved for PLD þ bortezomib versus
bortezomib (Table 2; Fig. 1). Similar results were
observed at the end of the cycle 4 landmark analysis (not
shown). At the end of cycle 2, larger reductions in M protein resulted in a longer duration of response as well as in
increasing percentages of patients having a complete

75% M protein reduction group had the highest CR þ
PR rates of 97.9% and 95.0% in the PLD þ bortezomib
and bortezomib alone treatment groups, respectively.

Safety
The safety profiles of the 2 treatment groups, PLD þ bortezomib and bortezomib alone, were comparable at the
cycle 2 landmark (Table 3). Of the 404 patients evaluated
at the cycle 2 landmark, 17% of patients receiving PLD þ
bortezomib experienced a grade 3 adverse event, compared with 13% of patients receiving bortezomib alone.
As expected, patients receiving PLD þ bortezomib experienced more hand-foot syndrome compared with patients
receiving bortezomib alone and more mucositis/stomatitis, but less peripheral neuropathy both overall, and at the

DISCUSSION
Analyses of modern therapeutic approaches to multiple
myeloma with regimens incorporating novel agents
have generally supported the hypothesis that response
quality predicts long-term outcomes, with deeper
responses being associated with longer TTP and overall
survival.2 However, there is some controversy about
whether the early response rapidity is similarly predictive. Schaar and colleagues conducted a study that prospectively evaluated the relationship between survival
and the rate of M protein decrement during the first
cycles of therapy in 262 patients with newly diagnosed
multiple myeloma who were included in a phase 3 trial
(HOVON-16).7 In this study, the median M protein
decrease after the first cycle of MP was 21% for IgG
and 27% for IgA, and declined to <5% after 4 cycles.
A survival advantage was seen for patients who had an
M protein decrease of at least 30% after the first MP
cycle, which became significant when an M protein
decrease of 40% or more was reached. They also found
that established prognostic parameters, including
Salmon and Durie stage, serum creatinine, and hemoglobin, remained significant, leading to the conclusion
that early response to MP treatment predicted for survival in multiple myeloma. However, in 2 retrospective
studies by Shimizu et al, also in the front-line setting,
the post-treatment nadir in M protein level was prognostic for survival outcome, but the percentage fall in
M protein was not prognostic.8,9 Moreover, van Rhee
et al have reported that a rapid reduction in myeloma
burden, as measured by a top-tertile reduction in the
serum-free light chain levels before cycle 2, predicted
for an inferior progression-free and 2-year overall survival after their induction therapy and tandem transplantation approach.10
In that these previous studies have focused predominantly on patients with newly-diagnosed disease, we

sought to determine the possible impact of rapid early disease response in the relapsed and/or refractory setting. In a
follow-up to the SUMMIT and CREST clinical trials,
patients with relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma who had progressive or stable disease after singleagent bortezomib therapy were eligible to receive dexamethasone as add-on therapy. Patients with an improved
response to the combination experienced a median reduction of 36.7% in M protein level, compared with a median reduction of 15.4% in responders on bortezomib
alone.11 Our analyses showed that, compared with the
group of patients with a less than 25% reduction, a 50%
or greater, and especially a 75% or greater reduction in M
protein levels at cycle 2 resulted in a significant risk reduction for time to progression. Indeed, for both the PLD þ
bortezomib and bortezomib alone cohorts, patients with a
75% M protein reduction had a TTP that was nearly
double that of the group with a <25% reduction. In addition, over 90% of patients with a 75% M protein reduction had CR þ PR, compared with less than 5% in the
<25% reduction group. For all of the response categories
studied, PLD þ bortezomib retained its superiority to
bortezomib alone in the primary study endpoint, TTP.
Moreover, these benefits were not associated with a significantly higher risk for patients to develop grade 3 or higher
adverse events and were associated with a predictable toxicity profile.
Limitations of the current study include: 1) this was
a post-hoc analysis of a phase 3 clinical trial; 2) comparisons between M protein-reduction groups at later landmark time points may be less meaningful due to
diminishing sample sizes on subsequent cycles of therapy;
and 3) as the comparators in the trial were PLD þ bortezomib and bortezomib alone, standard agents, such as
dexamethasone,12 were not included.
Taken together, our data support the possibility that
an early disease response, as defined by an at least 50% M

3761

Original Article

protein reduction after cycle 2 to bortezomib alone and
especially to PLD þ bortezomib, identifies a group of
patients with superior long-term outcomes. Moreover, these
data also provide a rationale for individualization of therapy
based on such early outcomes, in which those patients with
at least a 50% M protein response after cycle 2, and a 75%
response after cycle 4, would continue on bortezomib or
PLD þ bortezomib. Furthermore, this analysis provides a
pathway for additional study, including the investigation of
the effects of adding other agents to the combination therapy of PLD þ bortezomib or to bortezomib alone when
patients experience a less than adequate M protein response
(<25% reduction) in early therapy.
In summary, our results suggest that the combination of PLD þ bortezomib had significant benefit over
bortezomib alone in extending TTP of early responders in
cycle 2 and 4 landmark analyses similar to the overall
study. An early response of a >50% reduction in M protein at cycle 2 resulted in a significant risk reduction for
progression. These data suggest that early reductions in M
protein may provide better outcomes with PLD þ bortezomib combination therapy. More research is needed to
investigate the effect of early responses and M protein
reduction on outcomes in multiple myeloma.
