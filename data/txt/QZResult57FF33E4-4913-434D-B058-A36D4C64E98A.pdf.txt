Abstract
Tissue factor (TF) is aberrantly expressed in solid cancers and is thought to contribute to disease
progression through its procoagulant activity and its capacity to induce intracellular signaling in complex
with factor VIIa (FVIIa). To explore the possibility of using tissue factor as a target for an antibody-drug
conjugate (ADC), a panel of human tissue factor–speciﬁc antibodies (TF HuMab) was generated. Three tissue
factor HuMab, that induced efﬁcient inhibition of TF:FVIIa-dependent intracellular signaling, antibodydependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity, and rapid target internalization, but had minimal impact on tissue
factor procoagulant activity in vitro, were conjugated with the cytotoxic agents monomethyl auristatin E
(MMAE) or monomethyl auristatin F (MMAF). Tissue factor–speciﬁc ADCs showed potent cytotoxicity in
vitro and in vivo, which was dependent on tissue factor expression. TF-011-MMAE (HuMax-TF-ADC) was the
most potent ADC, and the dominant mechanism of action in vivo was auristatin-mediated tumor cell killing.
Importantly, TF-011-MMAE showed excellent antitumor activity in patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models
with variable levels of tissue factor expression, derived from seven different solid cancers. Complete tumor
regression was observed in all PDX models, including models that showed tissue factor expression in only
25% to 50% of the tumor cells. In conclusion, TF-011-MMAE is a promising novel antitumor agent with potent
activity in xenograft models that represent the heterogeneity of human tumors, including heterogeneous
target expression. Cancer Res; 74(4); 1214–26. 2013 AACR.

Introduction
Antibody-drug conjugates (ADC), which combine the
tumor-targeting capacity of monoclonal antibodies with the
antitumor activity of cytotoxic agents, received renewed attention in recent years. Trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1), an ADC
composed of the HER2-speciﬁc antibody trastuzumab and the
cytotoxic agent DM1, increased progression-free survival in
patients that had received prior treatment with unconjugated
trastuzumab (1), demonstrating the added value of toxin
conjugation to a monoclonal antibody. In addition, brentuximab vedotin, a CD30-speciﬁc antibody coupled to the microtubule disrupting agent monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE), was
approved for the treatment of relapsed Hodgkin lymphoma

and relapsed systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma (2). With
at least thirty products in clinical development, ADCs represent an exciting new class of anticancer drugs.
Tissue factor (TF), also called thromboplastin, factor III, or
CD142, is aberrantly expressed in many solid cancers, including pancreatic, lung, cervical, prostate, bladder, ovarian, breast,
and colon cancer. Expression has been described on tumor
cells and the tumor vasculature, and has been associated with
poor disease prognosis and increased metastatic properties
(reviewed in ref. 3). This, in combination with the known
internalizing capacity of tissue factor (4), led us to explore
the possibility of using tissue factor as a novel target for an
ADC.
Tissue factor is the main physiologic initiator of the
extrinsic coagulation pathway. Proteolytic cleavage of factor
VII (FVII), the physiologic ligand of tissue factor, generates
activated FVII (FVIIa), which associates with tissue factor to
form the TF:FVIIa complex. This complex proteolytically
activates coagulation factor X (FX) to generate FXa, eventually leading to thrombin generation and clot formation (5).
Tissue factor is expressed in a wide range of organs, including brain, heart, intestine, kidney, lung, placenta, uterus, and
testes (6). Under physiologic conditions, tissue factor expression is mostly restricted to the cells of the subendothelial
vessel wall, such as smooth muscle cells, pericytes, and

Potent Antitumor Activity of an ADC Targeting Tissue Factor

ﬁbroblasts, that are not in direct contact with the blood (6).
In healthy individuals, blood leukocytes do not express
tissue factor on the cell surface, although tissue factor
expression has been described on 1% to 2% of monocytes
(7, 8). Activation of the coagulation cascade occurs when
membrane-bound tissue factor is exposed to circulating FVII
(a), for example, after disruption of the vessel wall by injury
or after upregulation of tissue factor on monocytes under
inﬂammatory conditions (9).
In addition to initiation of coagulation, formation of the TF:
FVIIa complex on the cell membrane induces an intracellular
signaling cascade by activation of protease-activated receptor
2 (PAR-2), resulting in the production of proangiogenic factors,
cytokines and adhesion molecules (10). This signaling cascade
is further ampliﬁed by coagulation factors generated downstream of the TF:FVIIa complex, such as FXa and thrombin, all
of which recognize one or more receptors of the PAR family
(10).
Tissue factor-expressing tumor cells are thought to exploit
both tissue factor procoagulant activity and TF:FVIIa-mediated intracellular signaling. Experimental tumor models showed
that interference with tissue factor using siRNA or monoclonal
antibodies reduced tumor outgrowth, tumor-associated angiogenesis, and metastatic potential in vivo (11–13). Previous
studies demonstrated that it is possible to generate tissue
factor–speciﬁc antibodies that have minimal impact on tissue
factor procoagulant capacity (13, 14), potentially allowing
speciﬁc targeting of tissue factor–positive tumors without a
major impact on hemostasis.
Here, we report the development of TF-011-MMAE, an
ADC composed of a human tissue factor–speciﬁc monoclonal antibody, a protease-cleavable linker, and the potent
cytotoxic agent MMAE. By carefully selecting tissue factor–
speciﬁc antibodies that interfere with TF:FVIIa-dependent
intracellular signaling, but not with tissue factor procoagulant activity, and that show efﬁcient internalization and
lysosomal targeting, we developed an ADC that efﬁciently
kills tumor cells in vivo with only minimal effect on parameters of coagulation. TF-011-MMAE was extensively tested
in preclinical efﬁcacy studies, including studies in patientderived xenograft (PDX) models that showed heterogeneous
target expression.

Materials and Methods
Cells
Human tumor cell lines AsPC-1 (pancreas adenocarcinoma;
100,000–300,000 tissue factor molecules/cell), BxPC-3 (pancreas adenocarcinoma; >350,000 tissue factor molecules/cell),
HCT-116 (colorectal carcinoma; <15,000 tissue factor molecules/cell), HPAF-II (pancreas adenocarcinoma; >350,000 tissue factor molecules/cell), MDA-MB-231 (breast adenocarcinoma; >350,000 tissue factor molecules/cell), SK-OV-3 (ovarian
adenocarcinoma; 50,000–175,000 tissue factor molecules/cell),
and TOV-21G (ovarian adenocarcinoma; <7,000 tissue factor
molecules/cell) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. The epidermoid adenocarcinoma cell line A431
(>300,000 tissue factor molecules/cell) was obtained from the
Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen

www.aacrjournals.org

GmbH, and HaCaT human keratinocytes (150,000–200,000
tissue factor molecules/cell) were a kind gift from Dr. Wiiger
(Biotechnology Center of Oslo, Norway). To guarantee cell line
authenticity, cell lines were aliquoted and banked, and cultures
were grown and used for a limited number of passages before
starting a new culture from stock. Cell lines were routinely
tested for mycoplasma contamination. Tissue factor cell surface expression was quantiﬁed by QIFIKIT analysis (DAKO)
according to the manufacturer's guidelines, using a mouse
anti-human tissue factor antibody (R&D Systems).
Recombinant expression of full-length tissue factor or
the tissue factor extracellular domain
A codon-optimized construct was generated for the expression of full-length tissue factor (Genbank accession no.
NP001984), cloned into the mammalian expression vector
pEE13.4 (Lonza Biologics), and transfected into Freestyle
293-F cells (HEK-293F, Invitrogen) or NSO cells as described
(15). To generate recombinant His-tagged soluble tissue factor,
PCR was used to amplify the part encoding the extracellular
domain (aa 1-251) of tissue factor from the construct, adding a
C-terminal His tag containing six His residues (TF-ECDHis).
The construct was cloned in pEE13.4 and expressed in HEK293F cells. TF-ECDHis was puriﬁed from cell supernatant using
immobilized metal afﬁnity chromatography.
Generation of human tissue factor–speciﬁc antibodies
and ADCs
Human immunoglobulin G (IgG)-1k tissue factor–speciﬁc
antibodies (tissue factor HuMab) were generated by immunization of HuMAb mice (Medarex; ref. 16) with TF-ECDHis
and/or tissue factor-expressing NSO cells. Hybridomas were
generated from mice that showed tissue factor–speciﬁc
antibodies in serum, as assessed by binding to tissue factor-transfected HEK293F or A431 cells, or to bead-coupled
TF-ECDHis using Fluorimetric Microvolume Assay Technology (Applied Biosystems). Tissue factor–speciﬁc hybridomas
were identiﬁed by screening supernatants for tissue factor–
speciﬁc antibodies as described above. To determine the
antibody variable region sequences of tissue factor–speciﬁc
hybridomas, mRNA was extracted and the immunoglobulin
variable heavy and light chain regions were ampliﬁed,
cloned, and sequenced. Recombinant antibodies were generated as described (17), and the recombinant IgG1k was
used for further characterization of the tissue factor HuMab.
Fab fragments were generated as described (17). The IgG1k
antibodies IgG1-b12 (18) and HuMab-KLH (19) were included as isotype control antibodies.
Antibodies TF-011, -098, and -111, as well as IgG1-b12, were
conjugated with MMAE through a protease-cleavable valinecitrulline (vc) dipeptide and a maleimidocaproyl-containing
(mc) linker, or with monomethyl auristatin F (MMAF) through
an mc linker as described (20, 21). The average drug-antibody
ratio was 4:1.
Flow cytometry
Binding of tissue factor HuMab and tissue factor–speciﬁc
ADCs (TF-ADC) to membrane-bound tissue factor was

analyzed by ﬂow cytometry as described (22), using phycoerythrin-conjugated goat anti-human IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) to detect binding of tissue factor HuMab
or ADCs.
Biacore analysis
The afﬁnity of tissue factor HuMab for tissue factor was
measured by surface plasmon resonance in a Biacore 3000
(GE Healthcare). Tissue factor HuMab was immobilized on a
CM-5 sensor chip (GE Healthcare), according to the manufacturer's guidelines, and a concentration series of TFECDHis was injected over the HuMab (30 mL/minute; 180
seconds). The HuMab surface was regenerated using 10
mmol/L glycine-HCl, pH 2.0. Kinetic analysis was performed
using double reference subtraction and model 1:1 (Langmuir) binding analysis.
FVIIa ELISA
TF-ECDHis (0.5 mg/mL) was immobilized and incubated
with recombinant FVIIa (100 nmol/L, Novo Nordisk) in the
presence of tissue factor HuMab (1 hour, room temperature).
Plates were washed and incubated with rabbit-anti-FVIIa (2.5
mg/mL; Abcam), followed by incubation with swine-anti-rabbit
IgG-HRP (1:2,500; DAKO). Binding was visualized as described
(17).
Phosphorylation inhibition assay—Western blot
analysis
BxPC-3 or HaCaT cells were cultured in serum-free medium
for 1.5 hours before preincubation with tissue factor HuMab
(30 minutes, 37 C). Next, cells were stimulated with 10 nmol/L
FVIIa (10 minutes, 37 C) and lysed. Phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (p-ERK)-1/2 and total ERK1/2
were detected in cell lysates by Western blot analysis using
standard procedures, using rabbit anti-p-ERK1/2 and rabbitanti-ERK1/2 (Cell Signaling technology) as primary antibodies,
and donkey-anti-rabbit-IgG-HRP (Jackson Immunoresearch
Laboratories) as detection antibody.
Interleukin-8 release assay
MDA-MB-231 cells were cultured in serum-free medium for
105 minutes before incubation with tissue factor HuMab (15
minutes). FVIIa (10 nmol/L) was added and after 5 hours
(37 C), interleukin (IL)-8 production was measured in culture
supernatant by ELISA (Sanquin) according to the manufacturer's protocol.
FXa generation assay
Recombinant lipidated full-length tissue factor (Innovin;
Dade Behring) was incubated with tissue factor HuMab in
HEPES buffer containing 3 mmol/L CaCl2 (30 minutes, room
temperature). FXa generation was initiated by adding 1 nmol/L
recombinant FVIIa and 200 nmol/L FX (Enzyme Research
Laboratories). After 30 minutes (37 C), the reaction was
stopped by adding 5 mmol/L EDTA in HEPES buffer, and
FXa was detected by measuring conversion of the FXa substrate Chromogenix-2765 (Instrumation Laboratory Company) according to the manufacturer's guidelines.

Thromboelastography
Citrated human whole blood was obtained from healthy
volunteers with the donor's consent and approval from the
Ethical committee of the Florida Hospital Center (Orlando, FL).
Whole blood was incubated with 10 mg/mL lipopolysaccharide
(LPS) or PBS without Ca2þ and Mg2þ (4 hours, 37 C), followed
by incubation with tissue factor HuMab (10 minutes, room
temperature). Thromboelastography (TEG) was performed as
described (23). In this system, the LPS-induced decrease in
clotting lag time (R) represents a measure for tissue factor
activity. Antibody-mediated inhibition of tissue factor activity
was calculated as follows: % inhibition of tissue factor activity
¼ 100  [(RNo-LPS  Rtest itemþLPS)/(RNo-LPS  Risotype-mAbþLPS)
 100].
Immunoﬂuorescent confocal microscopy
SK-OV-3 and A431 cells were grown on glass coverslips
(Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc) at 37 C for 16 hours. Cells were
incubated with 50 mg/mL leupeptin (Sigma) for 1 hour
to block lysosomal activity, followed by incubation with 1
mg/mL tissue factor HuMab (1, 3, or 24 hours, 37 C). Cells
were ﬁxed with 4% formaldehyde (30 minutes, room temperature) and stained with ﬂuorescein isothiocyanate
(FITC)-labeled goat anti-human IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories) to identify tissue factor HuMab, and
mouse anti-human CD107a (LAMP-1)-allophycocyanin
(BD Pharmingen) to identify lysosomes. Staining was analyzed with a Leica SPE-II confocal microscope and LAS-AF
software.
Fab-TAMRA/QSY7 internalization and degradation
assay
Goat-anti-human IgG Fab-fragments (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories) were conjugated with the ﬂuorophore
and quencher pair TAMRA/QSY7 (Fab-TAMRA/QSY7) as
described (24). Tissue factor HuMab (1 mg/mL) was preincubated with Fab-TAMRA/QSY7 (2 mg/mL; 30 minutes,
4 C), and the complex was added to SK-OV-3 or A431 cells
while shaking (200 rpm, 37 C). After 24 hours, TAMRAﬂuorescence was measured on a FACS Canto-II (BD
Biosciences).
Cytotoxicity assay in vitro
Cells were seeded in 96-well plates (2,500–5,000 cells/well)
and incubated for 6 hours (37 C), before adding ADCs. After
3 to 5 days (37 C), the viability of the culture was assessed
using Alamar Blue (Biosource International) according
to the manufacturer's guidelines. Staurosporine (Sigma, 10
mg/mL) was used a positive control (100% cell death) and
untreated cells were used as a negative control. The
percentage of viable cells was calculated as follows: %
viable cells ¼ [(ﬂuorescence test sample  ﬂuorescence
staurosporine)/(ﬂuorescence untreated cells  ﬂuorescence
staurosporine)]  100.
Antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity assay
Lysis of tumor cells by antibody-dependent cell-mediated
cytotoxicity (ADCC) was measured in a 51Cr release assay as

described (25), using A431, BxPC-3, and MDA-MB-231 cells as
target cells and human peripheral blood mononuclear cells
(PBMC), isolated from healthy donors (Sanquin), as effector
cells.
Immunohistochemical analysis of tissue factor
expression in PDX models
A tissue microarray containing formalin-ﬁxed, parafﬁnembedded (FFPE) PDX tissue (Oncotest GmbH) was incubated with FITC-labeled TF-011 or mouse anti-human cytokeratin antibody (Cell Marque; 1 hour, room temperature),
after antigen retrieval (citrate/EDTA buffer, pH8, in a pressure cooker for 5 minutes for TF-011-FITC and citrate buffer,
pH6, for mouse anti-cytokeratin). Endogenous peroxidase
(PO) activity was exhausted by incubation with H2O2, and
nonspeciﬁc antibody binding was blocked using chicken
serum or normal human serum. Binding of TF-011-FITC
was detected using rabbit anti-FITC (Zymed) and Powervision (anti-rabbit IgG1)-PO (Leica Biosystems). Mouse-anticytokeratin binding was detected using Ultravision-PO
(Thermo Scientiﬁc). Peroxidase was visualized with amino-ethyl-carbazole, resulting in a red color. Nuclei were
visualized using hematoxylin. Immunostaining was scored
manually, by estimating the tissue factor–positive tumor
area in relation to the total tumor area as identiﬁed by
human cytokeratin staining. The tissue factor–positive
tumor area was scored according to the following intervals:
0 (no tissue factor–positive cells), 0% to 25%, 25% to 50%,
50% to 75%, or >75% tissue factor–positive cells.
Xenograft models
Cell line-derived xenograft models were established in
female SCID mice by subcutaneous injection of 2 to 10 
106 (HPAF-II), 5  106 (A431, AsPC-1, and BxPC-3), or 0.5 
106 (HCT-116) tumor cells as described (22). Tissue factor
HuMab were injected intraperitoneally 1 hour after tumor
injection (prophylactic treatment) or when tumors had
reached a size of 100 to 400 mm3 (therapeutic treatment,
starting between day 8–13). All experiments were approved
by the Utrecht University (Utrecht, the Netherlands) Animal
Ethics Committee.
PDX models were initiated by subcutaneous implantation of
human tumor fragments in the ﬂanks of NMRI nu/nu mice at
Oncotest GmbH. When tumors had reached a size of 80 to 200
mm3, mice were treated intravenously with 4 mg/kg ADC or 20
mg/kg paclitaxel (Teva-Gry Pharma). Tumor volume was
determined as described above. All experiments were conducted according to the guidelines of the German Animal
Welfare Act (Tierschutzgesetz).
Statistical analysis
Data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism 5 software.
For mouse xenograft studies, differences in tumor size
between treatment groups were analyzed by one-way
ANOVA, using mean tumor sizes from the last day that
all groups were complete (i.e., before mice in isotype
control groups had to be sacriﬁced because of large tumor
burden).

Results
Target-binding characteristics of tissue factor HuMab
From a large panel of human tissue factor–speciﬁc IgG1k
antibodies (tissue factor HuMab), eight clones were selected for extensive functional characterization in vitro and in
vivo. All tissue factor HuMab showed dose-dependent
binding to tissue factor–positive MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells (Fig. 1A). EC50 values ranged from 0.07 mg/mL for
TF-011 to 0.49 mg/mL for TF-109 (subnanomolar to nanomolar range; Supplementary Table S1). Similar results
were obtained using BxPC-3 pancreas adenocarcinoma
and A431 epidermoid carcinoma cells (data not shown).
Biacore analysis demonstrated that tissue factor HuMab
bound tissue factor with afﬁnities ranging from 1.8 nmol/L
for TF-025 to 307 nmol/L for TF-098 (Supplementary
Table S1).
Tissue factor–speciﬁc antibodies interfere with TF:
FVIIa-mediated intracellular signaling
Tissue factor–speciﬁc antibodies may interfere with the
interaction between tissue factor and FVIIa, possibly resulting
in inhibition of TF:FVIIa-dependent intracellular signaling. To
measure competition between tissue factor HuMab and FVIIa
for tissue factor binding, FVIIa was incubated with TF-ECDHis
in the presence of tissue factor HuMab, and binding of FVIIa
was detected by ELISA. Except for TF-044 and TF-013, tissue
factor HuMab efﬁciently inhibited binding of FVIIa to tissue
factor, with only 9% to 21% of FVIIa binding remaining at the
highest antibody concentration tested (30 mg/mL; Fig.
1B; Table 1).
Next, the capacity of tissue factor HuMab to interfere
with TF:FVIIa—dependent PAR-2 signaling was assessed by
measuring antibody-mediated inhibition of ERK1/2 phosphorylation and IL-8 production, both of which have been
implicated in tumor cell proliferation, migration, and metastatic potential (26, 27). When preincubated with BxPC-3
or HaCaT cells, all tissue factor HuMab, except TF-013,
inhibited TF:FVIIa-induced ERK phosphorylation, as shown
by Western blot analysis (Fig. 1C and data not shown).
Inhibition of TF:FVIIa-induced ERK phosphorylation was
conﬁrmed in A431 cells using Alphascreen, which allowed
more quantitative detection of p-ERK1/2 (Table 1 and
Supplementary Fig. S1). The tissue factor HuMab that
showed efﬁcient inhibition of ERK1/2 phosphorylation, also
inhibited TF:FVIIa-dependent production of IL-8 by MDAMB-231 cells when antibodies were allowed to bind the cells
before stimulation with FVIIa (Fig. 1D). In the reverse
experiment, where the tumor cells were incubated with
FVIIa before adding tissue factor HuMab, inhibition of
TF:FVIIa-induced IL-8 production was clearly less efﬁcient,
conﬁrming competition between FVIIa and tissue factor
HuMab for tissue factor binding (Supplementary Fig. S2).
In agreement with poor inhibition of FVIIa binding, TF044 only moderately inhibited TF:FVIIa-dependent intracellular signaling, whereas TF-013 showed almost no
inhibition.
These results suggest that tissue factor HuMab recognize
distinct functional epitopes in the tissue factor extracellular

factor–speciﬁc antibodies may interfere with binding of FX to
the catalytic domain of TF:FVIIa, thereby impairing FXa generation and coagulation (14). None of the tissue factor HuMab
in our panel substantially inhibited FXa generation as shown in
a chromogenic FXa generation assay (Table 1). TF-013 induced
the highest inhibition of FXa generation, but even for this
antibody, the reduction in FXa activity was maximally 22%.
The impact of tissue factor HuMab (TF-011, TF-013, and TF098) on whole-blood coagulation was assessed by TEG.
Citrated whole blood, obtained from healthy donors, was
incubated with LPS to induce tissue factor expression on
monocytes and release of monocyte-derived tissue factor–
positive microparticles (8, 28). LPS treatment induced a
decrease in clotting lag time compared with untreated blood
(Supplementary Table S3), which, in this system, represents a
measure for tissue factor activity. TF-011 and -098 showed
minor interference with tissue factor activity, as shown by a
small delay in LPS-induced clotting. At a concentration of 50
mg/mL, the average inhibition of tissue factor activity was 22%
for TF-011 and 31% for TF-098. TF-013 showed a somewhat
stronger inhibition of tissue factor procoagulant activity (66%).
Results obtained at 10, 20, and 50 mg/mL tissue factor HuMab
were comparable (Fig. 1E). Tissue factor HuMab did not have
impact on other parameters of clot formation such as the clot
kinetics (K value and a-angle) or clot strength (maximal
amplitude), as shown by the similar shape of the TEG trace
in the presence or absence of tissue factor HuMab (Fig. 1F and
Supplementary Table S3). This was as expected, as tissue factor
is thought to be important for the initiation but not the
ampliﬁcation or propagation of coagulation (9).
Tissue factor HuMab are rapidly internalized after target
binding
Because ADCs generally rely on internalization for release of
the payload, we characterized the internalization character-

istics of tissue factor HuMab in the TAMRA/QSY7 assay. This
assay uses a ﬂuorophore (TAMRA) and quencher (QSY7) pair.
In close proximity, for example, upon conjugation to the same
protein, TAMRA ﬂuorescence is quenched by QSY7. Tissue
factor HuMab were complexed with TAMRA/QSY7-conjugated
anti-human IgG Fab fragments (Fab-TAMRA/QSY7), and the
complex was incubated with A431 or SK-OV-3 cells. After 6
hours, TAMRA ﬂuorescence was detected in cells that had been
incubated with TF-011, TF-098, or TF-111 (Fig. 2A and B),
indicating internalization of the HuMab-Fab-TAMRA/QSY7
complex and degradation in the reducing environment of the
endosomes and lysosomes. Internalization was most efﬁcient
for TF-011 and TF-098. Interestingly, internalization of TF-011
was reduced when Fab fragments were used instead of the
intact antibody (Fig. 2B), suggesting that internalization of TF011 is stimulated by bivalent target binding.
Efﬁcient internalization of TF-011 was conﬁrmed by confocal microscopy. One hour after incubation with SK-OV-3
cells, TF-011 was already detectable in intracellular vesicles,
some of which colocalized with the lysosomal marker LAMP-1,
indicating internalization and lysosomal targeting. Colocalization of TF-011 and LAMP-1 was enhanced after 3 hours, and
after 24 hours, most TF-011 colocalized with LAMP-1, indicating efﬁcient accumulation in the lysosomal compartment
(Fig. 2C). Similar results were obtained with A431 cells (data
not shown).
Our results demonstrate that tissue factor HuMab are
rapidly internalized and degraded upon target binding, indicating that tissue factor may be a very suitable ADC target.
Generation of tissue factor–speciﬁc ADCs and
cytotoxicity in vitro
Tissue factor–speciﬁc ADCs were generated by conjugation
of TF-011, -098, and -111 with the dolastatin analogs MMAE or
MMAF. Auristatins are potent cytotoxic agents that induce cell

death by disrupting microtubules (20, 21). MMAE was conjugated through the protease-cleavable vc linker, and can therefore be released from the antibody by lysosomal proteases,
such as cathepsin B (21). MMAF was conjugated through a
noncleavable linker, and relies on intracellular degradation of
the ADC for release (20). Tissue factor HuMab were conjugated
with an average of four auristatins per antibody, a ratio that
was shown to provide the optimal therapeutic index for
brentuximab vedotin (29). Direct comparison of tissue factor
HuMab and TF-ADCs in vitro conﬁrmed that target binding
and internalization characteristics were preserved in the ADCs
(Fig. 2A and Supplementary Fig. S3).
TF-ADCs showed excellent cytotoxicity in vitro. TF-ADCs
efﬁciently and dose dependently killed A431 and HPAF-II cells
(Fig. 3A and B), which express high levels of tissue factor on the

plasma membrane (>300,000 molecules/cell). The EC50 for TFADC–mediated tumor cell killing in A431 and HPAF-II cells
ranged from 4 to 10 ng/mL, for TF-011-MMAE and TF-098MMAE, to 5 to 80 ng/mL, for TF-111-MMAF. In cell lines that
showed low (HCT-116; <15,000 molecules/cell) or very low
(TOV-21G; <7,000 molecules/cell) tissue factor expression, TFADCs showed very limited or no cytotoxic activity (Fig. 3C and
D). Similarly, TF-ADCs did not show cytotoxic activity in tissue
factor-negative tumor cells (data not shown). This, in addition
to the lack of cytotoxic activity of the nonbinding control ADCs
IgG1-b12-MMAE and IgG1-b12-MMAF, indicates that the efﬁcacy of TF-ADCs is dependent on target expression.
Unconjugated tissue factor HuMab did not induce direct
cytotoxicity in vitro (data not shown), indicating that the
cytotoxicity of TF-ADCs was auristatin dependent.

measured to assess cytotoxicity, and the percentage kill was calculated. Results are representative of experiments performed with PBMC from six
(tissue factor HuMab) or two (TF-ADC) different donors. Error bars, SEM.

Tissue factor HuMab and TF-ADCs efﬁciently induce
ADCC in vitro
Monoclonal antibodies of the IgG1 isotype may exert cytotoxicity through Fc-mediated effector functions such as ADCC,
and these effector mechanisms may be preserved upon conjugation with cytotoxic agents (30). Unconjugated TF-011, TF098, and TF-111 potently induced killing of A431 cells by ADCC
(Fig. 3E), with median EC50 values of 15 ng/mL (range 0.5–19
ng/mL), 18 ng/mL (range 5.0–57 ng/mL), and 76 ng/mL (range
15–102 ng/mL), respectively. Similar results were observed
with BxPC-3 and MDA-MB-231 cells (data not shown). Importantly, the capacity to induce ADCC was preserved after
conjugation with MMAE (Fig. 3E).
Antitumor activity of tissue factor–speciﬁc ADCs in cell
line-derived xenograft models
All TF-ADCs potently inhibited tumor growth in established xenografts derived from HPAF-II and A431 cells, at a

dose of 3 mg/kg (four injections in 2 weeks; Fig. 4A and
Supplementary Fig. S4A). MMAE conjugates showed significantly better efﬁcacy than their MMAF-conjugated counterparts (Fig. 4B and Supplementary Fig. S4B). Complete tumor
regression, that is no measurable tumor remaining at 20 to
30 days after the last treatment, was observed for most mice
in the TF-098-MMAE and TF-111-MMAE treatment groups,
and for all mice in the TF-011-MMAE group. Strikingly, 3
out of 7 mice that had been treated with TF-011-MMAE
remained tumor free until the end of the study (139 days
after discontinuation of treatment). In mice that did show
tumor recurrence after treatment with TF-011-MMAE (4 out
of 7 mice in the HPAF-II model), measurable tumors were
not detected until 56 to 70 days after discontinuation of
treatment. Recurring tumors could successfully be retreated
with TF-011-MMAE, TF-098-MMAE, or TF-111-MMAE (Fig.
4C and Supplementary Fig. S4C), indicating that tissue
factor expression was maintained in tumor cells that

was supported by the lack of activity of TF-ADCs in the low

Potent Antitumor Activity of an ADC Targeting Tissue Factor

Figure 5. Heterogeneous
expression of tissue factor in
PDX models. IHC analysis was
performed to assess tissue factor
expression in PDX models. The
percentage of tissue factor–
positive tumor cells was estimated
by comparing human cytokeratin
staining (which identiﬁes human
tumor cells) with tissue factor
staining (indicating tissue factor–
positive tumor cells). In PDX
models for lung adenocarcinoma
(A) and pancreatic
adenocarcinoma (B), >75% of the
tumor cells showed tissue factor
expression. In PDX models for
bladder (urothelial)
adenocarcinoma (C), prostate
adenocarcinoma (D), and lung
squamous cell carcinoma (E),
tissue factor expression was
observed in 50% to 75% of the
tumor cells. In PDX models for
squamous cell carcinoma of the
cervix (F) and ovarian
adenocarcinoma (G), 25% to 50%
of the tumor cells showed tissue
factor expression. H,
representative pictures showing
immunostaining with the isotype
control antibody IgG1-b12.

To study the potential contribution of ADCC and inhibition
of TF:FVIIa-dependent intracellular signaling to the antitumor
activity of TF-ADCs in vivo, xenograft studies were performed
using unconjugated TF-011, TF-098, or TF-111. Prophylactic
treatment with TF-011, TF-098, or TF-111 signiﬁcantly reduced
outgrowth of BxPC-3, HPAF-II, AsPC-1, and A431 xenografts
(Supplementary Fig. S5A–S5D and data not shown). When
treatment was initiated after the tumors had established
(therapeutic treatment), TF-098 and TF-111 induced a small,
albeit signiﬁcant, reduction of tumor growth in the BxPC-3
model (Supplementary Fig. S5E and S5F). However, therapeutic
treatment with unconjugated tissue factor HuMab was unable
to inhibit tumor growth in the A431, AsPC-1, and HPAF-II
xenograft models (Supplementary Fig. S5G and S5H and data
not shown). This suggests that the antitumor activity of TFADCs in the established xenografts tested here is to a large
extent mediated by the cytotoxic activity of MMAE or MMAF.
The antitumor efﬁcacy of the most potent ADC, TF-011MMAE, was assessed at different dose levels and dosing
schedules. At weekly dosing (four doses), treatment with 1
mg/kg TF-011-MMAE was sufﬁcient to induce tumor regression (Fig. 4D). When administered as a single dose, 2 and 4 mg/
kg TF-011-MMAE induced tumor regression, whereas inhibition of tumor growth was observed after treatment with 0.5 or 1
mg/kg (Fig. 4E). Interestingly, comparison of tumor volumes
on day 24, when mice had received either one or two doses of

www.aacrjournals.org

TF-011-MMAE, demonstrated that a single dose of 1 mg/kg TF011-MMAE was more effective than two doses of 0.5 mg/kg,
although the cumulative dose was the same in both treatment
groups. Similarly, treatment with a single dose of 2 mg/kg was
more effective than two doses of 1 mg/kg (Fig. 4F). This
suggests that, at the same cumulative dose (exposure), dosing
schedules giving a higher peak plasma level (Cmax) are more
effective. For treatment with a cumulative dose of 4 mg/kg, no
difference in efﬁcacy was observed between a single dose of 4
mg/kg and two doses of 2 mg/kg, because tumor regression
was complete in both groups.
In summary, TF-ADCs showed potent antitumor activity in
vivo, which was dependent on both tissue factor targeting and
conjugation with auristatins. TF-011-MMAE was selected for
further preclinical studies and clinical development (designated as HuMax-TF-ADC).
TF-011-MMAE induces efﬁcient tumor cell killing in PDX
models with heterogeneous tissue factor expression
Like most solid tumor targets, expression of tissue factor in
cancer is heterogeneous between patients, within patients, and
even within tumors (3). We addressed the capacity of TF-011MMAE to inhibit the growth of tumors with heterogeneous
target expression using PDX models, which are thought to
represent the heterogeneity that exists between human tumors
(31-33). Immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis of xenografted

In the models for pancreas and lung adenocarcinoma, which
showed >75% tissue factor–positive tumor cells, TF-011MMAE induced complete tumor regression in all mice (Fig.
6A). Similarly, TF-011-MMAE induced efﬁcient tumor regression in PDX models that expressed tissue factor in 50% to 75%
of tumor cells (bladder cancer, prostate cancer, and lung
squamous cell carcinoma; Fig. 6B). Importantly, tumor regression was also observed in models that showed tissue factor
expression in only 25% to 50% of the tumor cells (ovarian and
cervical cancer; Fig. 6C).
Treatment with two doses of HuMax-TF-ADC was at least as
efﬁcient as treatment with three or four doses of paclitaxel (Fig.
6). Moreover, TF-011-MMAE induced tumor regression in mice
that showed tumor recurrence after paclitaxel treatment, even
in mice with relatively large tumors (Supplementary Fig. S6).
This demonstrates that prior treatment with paclitaxel did not

primary human tumor biopsies conﬁrmed heterogeneity of
tissue factor expression, and seven PDX models were selected on the basis of variable levels of tissue factor expression.
Tissue factor expression was observed in >75% of tumor cells
in the PDX models for lung and pancreas adenocarcinoma
(Fig. 5A and B), and in 50% to 75% of tumor cells in the
models for bladder carcinoma, prostate carcinoma, and lung
squamous cell carcinoma (Fig. 5C–E). In PDX models for
cervix squamous cell carcinoma and ovarian adenocarcinoma, only 25% to 50% of tumor cells were tissue factor
positive (Fig. 5F and G).
PDX tumors were implanted subcutaneously in nude mice,
and when tumors had established, mice were treated with TF011-MMAE (4 mg/kg, two doses). In models where the sensitivity to microtubule-targeting agents was not known, a paclitaxel treatment group (20 mg/kg, 3–4 doses) was included.

Potent Antitumor Activity of an ADC Targeting Tissue Factor

affect the sensitivity of the tumors to treatment with TF-011MMAE, indicating that tissue factor expression and sensitivity
to MMAE-mediated tumor cell killing were retained in tumors
that showed outgrowth after paclitaxel treatment.

Discussion
TF-011-MMAE was selected from a panel of six tissue factor–
speciﬁc ADCs, consisting of three different tissue factor
HuMab conjugated with vcMMAE or mcMMAF. TF-011MMAE showed excellent antitumor activity in vivo, with auristatin-mediated tumor cell killing as the dominant mechanism of action. Furthermore, TF-011-MMAE and unconjugated
TF-011 induced inhibition of TF:FVIIa-mediated intracellular
signaling and ADCC in vitro, although it is unclear to what
extent these mechanisms may contribute to the inhibition of
tumor growth in patients with cancer. To our knowledge, TF011-MMAE is the ﬁrst ADC that uses a tissue factor–speciﬁc
antibody to deliver a cytotoxic agent to tumor cells.
Importantly, TF-011-MMAE induced complete tumor
regression in PDX models, even if only a subpopulation of the
tumor cells expressed tissue factor. PDX models are thought to
represent the genetic and histologic heterogeneity in human
tumors, and efﬁcacy of treatment in such models was shown to
have predictive value for the clinic (31–33). The high potency of
TF-011-MMAE in tumors with nonhomogeneous target
expression may be related to the capacity of MMAE to cause
a bystander effect by diffusion across cell membranes after
intracellular release (34). Especially in solid tumors, where
antibody penetration may be limited (35, 36), this may be a
major advantage. As opposed to uncharged MMAE, the negative charge of MMAF is thought to prevent diffusion across
membranes (20). This difference in membrane permeability
probably underlies the difference in efﬁcacy observed between
MMAE and MMAF conjugates.
Although tissue factor plays a crucial role in coagulation and
hemostasis, TF-011 showed minimal impact on coagulation in
vitro. Previous studies suggested that tissue factor–speciﬁc
antibodies can roughly be divided into two categories: those
that inhibit FVIIa binding and/or TF:FVIIa-induced intracellular signaling with minor impact on tissue factor procoagulant activity, and those that interfere with FXa activation and
coagulation without impacting on TF:FVIIa-induced intracellular signaling (14, 37). Our in vitro studies suggest that TF-011
belongs to the ﬁrst category. This notion is supported by
nonclinical toxicology studies in cynomolgus monkeys. TF011 and TF-011-MMAE, which show comparable binding to
cynomolgus monkey and human tissue factor, did not significantly impact on functional bleeding time or systemic para-

meters of coagulation in cynomolgus monkeys at doses up to
100 mg/kg or 5 to 6 mg/kg, respectively (Genmab, data on ﬁle).
It may seem counterintuitive that TF:FVIIa binding, the ﬁrst
step in the coagulation cascade, can be inhibited without
impacting on hemostasis or clotting. This apparent paradox
is most likely explained by the many ampliﬁcation steps in the
coagulation cascade downstream of TF:FVIIa (38). As a result,
only little TF:FVIIa binding is required to maintain hemostasis.
The work of Parry and colleagues, who demonstrated that
transgenic mice expressing only 1% of normal tissue factor
activity were viable and had relatively normal hemostasis (39),
supports this.
In summary, TF-011-MMAE is a promising new ADC that is
being developed for the treatment of solid tumors. Tissue
factor is thought to be an excellent ADC target due to its
broad expression proﬁle across solid cancer types and rapid
internalization and degradation after antibody binding. TF011-MMAE induced complete tumor regression in PDX models
derived from a broad range of solid tumors, demonstrating the
high potency of TF-011-MMAE for treatment of cancer.
