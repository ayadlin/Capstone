Abstract
Progression of prostate cancer is believed to be dependent on
angiogenesis induced by tumor cells. 3,3¶-Diindolylmethane
(DIM) has been shown to repress neovascularization in a
Matrigel plug assay and inhibit cell proliferation, migration,
invasion, and capillary tube formation of cultured human
umbilical vein endothelial cells. However, the molecular
mechanism, by which DIM inhibits angiogenesis and invasion,
has not been fully elucidated. Therefore, we sought to explore
the molecular mechanism by which DIM inhibits angiogenesis
and invasion, specifically by investigating the role of
angiogenic factors secreted by prostate cancer cells which
control all steps of angiogenesis. We found that BioResponse
DIM (B-DIM), a formulated DIM with higher bioavailability,
inhibited angiogenesis and invasion by reducing the bioavailability of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) via
repressing extracellular matrix–degrading proteases, such as
matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 and urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA), in human prostate cancer cells and
reduced vascularity (angiogenesis) in vivo using Matrigel plug
assay. We also found that B-DIM treatment inhibited DNA
binding activity of nuclear factor-KB (NF-KB), which is known
to mediate the expression of many NF-KB downstream target
genes, including VEGF, IL-8, uPA, and MMP-9, all of which are
involved in angiogenesis, invasion, and metastasis. Our data
suggest that inhibition of NF-KB DNA binding activity by
B-DIM contributes to the regulated bioavailability of VEGF
by MMP-9 and uPA and, in turn, inhibits invasion and angiogenesis, which could be mechanistically linked with the
antitumor activity of B-DIM as observed previously by our
laboratory in a prostate cancer animal model. [Cancer Res

Introduction
The growth and metastasis of prostate cancer and other tumors
is dependent on the induction of new blood vessels from
preexisting ones through angiogenesis (1). Growing evidence
shows that prostate cancer cells secrete high levels of growth
factors and matrix-degrading proteases, including fibroblast
growth factor (FGF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF),
platelet-derived growth factor, matrix metalloproteinases (MMP;
ref. 2), and serine proteases, in particular, the urokinase-type

plasminogen activator (uPA; ref. 3). Many studies have documented
that VEGF is a critical mediator of angiogenesis and regulates most
of the steps in the angiogenic cascade, including proliferation,
migration, and tube formation of endothelial cells (4, 5). VEGF
exists in at least six isoforms with variable amino acid residues
produced through alternative splicing: VEGF121, VEGF145,
VEGF165, VEGF183, VEGF189, and VEGF206 (6). VEGF121,
VEGF165, and VEGF189 are the major forms secreted by most
cell types. After secretion, VEGF121 diffuses relatively freely in
tissues, whereas approximately half of the secreted VEGF165 binds
to heparin sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG) on the cell surface and
matrix basement membrane. VEGF189 remains almost completely
sequestered by HSPGs in the extracellular matrix (ECM), making
the HSPGs a reservoir of VEGF that can be released by proteolysis
(6). VEGF is subjected to multilevel regulation to ensure proper
expression under physiologic and pathologic conditions. A wide
range of cytokines, oncogenic proteins, or transcription factors,
such as insulin-like growth factor 1, c-Src, Ras, nuclear factor-nB
(NF-nB), and SP1, have been shown to regulate VEGF gene
transcription (7–9). Hypoxic condition can also affect VEGF mRNA
stability (10) and translation initiation (11). Extracellular cleavage
of VEGF by uPA (12, 13) or plasmin (14) and processing by MMPs
can regulate its mitogenic effect, bioavailability, and vascular
patterning in tumors (15). These multilevel regulated patterns of
VEGF provide various targets for the inhibition of angiogenesis
induced by tumors.
Epidemiologic studies have shown a strong inverse correlation
between consumption of cruciferous vegetables and a risk of
prostate cancer (16). One of the bioactive components of these
vegetables is indole-3-carbinol. Indole-3-carbinol, in a low-pH
environment, is easily converted to its dimeric product 3,3¶diindolylmethane (DIM). DIM can inhibit the growth of tumors
through induction of apoptosis and G1 cell-cycle arrest in human
prostate cancer cells (17, 18). Recent studies have shown that DIM
inhibits cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and capillary tube
formation of cultured human umbilical vascular endothelial cell
(HUVEC) and represses vascularization in a Matrigel plug assay and
tumorigenesis in human breast cancer cell xenograft model in mice
(19). Another study showed that DIM inhibits angiogenesis via
inhibition of growth factor–induced Ras signaling in HUVECs (20).
However, the molecular mechanism by which DIM inhibits
angiogenesis and invasion has not been fully elucidated. Tumor
angiogenesis involves degradation of the basement membrane of the
original vessel, endothelial cell activation, migration, proliferation,
and formation of new capillaries. All these processes are controlled
by angiogenic factors secreted either by the tumor or the surrounding stroma. During the process of tumor angiogenesis, tumor
cells express high levels of angiogenic factors, such as VEGF, MMP-9,
and uPA, which are important for angiogenesis, invasion, and

metastasis. Little is known about whether DIM is able to inhibit
angiogenesis in prostate tumor cells by regulating these angiogenic
factors. In this report, we show that BioResponse DIM (B-DIM),
a formulated DIM with higher bioavailability, inhibits angiogenesis
and invasion by reducing the bioavailability of VEGF due to decreased
expression of uPA and MMP-9, resulting from the inhibition of
NF-nB DNA binding activity in human prostate cancer cells.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines and culture. Prostate cancer cell lines LNCaP (AR+ and
responsive to androgen) and C4-2B (AR+ but nonresponsive to androgen)
cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 10 Amol/L HEPES, 100 units/mL
penicillin, and 100 Ag/mL streptomycin. HUVECs were purchased from
American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and cultured in F12K
medium (American Type Culture Collection) supplemented with 10% FBS,
0.1 mg/mL heparin sulfate, 0.05 mg/mL endothelial cell growth factor
supplement (BD Bioscience, San Jose, CA), 100 units/mL penicillin, and 100
Ag/mL streptomycin. All cells were cultured in a 5% CO2–humidified
atmosphere at 37jC.
Reagent and antibody. B-DIM, a formulated DIM with higher
bioavailability, was kindly provided by Dr. Michael Zeligs (BioResponse,
Boulder, CO) and was dissolved in DMSO to make 50 mmol/L stock
solutions and stored at 20jC in multiple aliquots. Antibody against
human VEGF (SC-152, A-20) and anti-uPA antibody were obtained from
Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti–MMP-9 monoclonal
antibody was obtained from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). The
monoclonal antibody to h-actin was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St.
Louis, MO). Matrigel, growth factor–reduced Matrigel, and recombinant
human VEGF165 were obtained from BD Bioscience (Bedford, MA). VEGF
neutralizing antibody was obtained from Lab Vision (Fremont, CA). AntiCD31 antibody was purchased from Ventana Medical Systems, Inc. (Tucson,
AZ). VEGF quantikine ELISA kits and MMP-9 fluorescent assay kits were
purchased from R&D Systems.
Matrigel in vitro HUVECs tube formation assay. LNCaP and C4-2B
cells cultured in serum-free RPMI 1640 were treated with B-DIM for 24 h.
The conditioned media were collected, centrifuged, transferred to fresh
tubes, and stored at 20jC. Growth factor–reduced Matrigel (125 AL),
after being thawed on ice, was plated in an 8-well chamber (Fisher, Hanover
Park, IL). The chamber was then incubated at 37jC for 30 min to allow the
Matrigel to polymerize. HUVECs maintained in F12K complete medium and
starved for 4 h were trypsinized and seeded (5  104 cells per well) in each
well with 250 AL of conditioned medium from LNCaP or C4-2B cells treated
with DMSO or 10 Amol/L of B-DIM in serum-free RPMI 1640 for 24 h.
VEGF165 (50 ng/mL) was used as a positive control and medium only was
used as a negative control. Before being added into the HUVECs,
conditioned media from LNCaP and C4-2B cells were preincubated with
anti-VEGF neutralizing antibody at 37jC for 1 h to confirm that the tube
formation induced by conditioned medium is related to VEGF secreted by
prostate cancer cells. HUVECs grown in growth factor–reduced Matrigel
were treated with DMSO or 10 Amol/L B-DIM for 6 h to observe whether
B-DIM directly affects tube formation of HUVECs, The chamber was
incubated for 6 h. Each well was photographed using an inverted
microscope with digital camera. Image analysis of tubule/capillary length
was carried out using the software image analysis program Scion Image
downloaded from the NIH website.1
ELISA assay for VEGF and MMP-9. LNCaP and C4-2B cells were seeded
in six-well plates. After 24 h, the cells were incubated with serum-free
medium for another 24 h and then treated with B-DIM or DMSO as a vehicle
control in 1% FBS for 24 h. The culture media were collected, centrifuged to
remove cellular debris, and stored at 70jC until assay for VEGF and MMP-9.
In addition, LNCaP and C4-2B cells were seeded in six-well plates. After

24 h, the cells were transfected with MMP-9 plasmid or pcDNA3 control
plasmid using effectene transfection reagent (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). The
media were removed after 18 h of transfection, and the cells were treated
with 10 Amol/L B-DIM in serum-free media and incubated for 24 h. To
investigate the effects of uPA on the release of VEGF, LNCaP and C4-2B cells
were transfected with uPA small interfering RNA (siRNA; Santa Cruz) or
control siRNA using DharmaFECT3 siRNA transfection reagent (Dharmacon, Lafayette, CO). The media were removed after 18 h of transfection, and
the cells were incubated in serum-free media for 24 h. The culture media
were collected, centrifuged to remove cellular debris, and stored at 70jC
until assay for VEGF. The cells in the plate were trypsinizied, and the total
number of cells was determined by cell counting. The assay was done using
a commercially available VEGF and MMP-9 ELISA kit (R&D System)
according to the manufacturer’s instruction. For MMP-9 assay, the culture
media were concentrated using the microcon concentrator (Millipore,
Billerica, MA). Results were normalized to the cell number.
Real-time reverse transcription–PCR. LNCaP and C4-2B cells grown in
1% FBS were treated with 10 Amol/L B-DIM or DMSO as a vehicle control for
24 h. The total RNA was isolated using the Trizol reagent. One microgram of
RNA was reverse transcribed using a reverse transcription system
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer’s instruction.
Real-time PCR was used to quantify mRNA expression. Sequence of
oligonucleotide primers and probes for total VEGF, VEGF121, VEGF165,
and VEGF189 used in this study was described by Dr. Gustafsson (21).
h-Actin was used for internal control to correct the potential variation in
RNA loading. Targets and h-actin gene were run under the same conditions.
All reactions were done in a 25-AL volume containing the sample cDNA,
TaqMan fast universal PCR mastermix, primers, and probes. Before the PCR
cycles, samples were incubated for 2 min at 50jC and 10 min at 95jC.
Thermal cycles consisted of 45 cycles at 95jC for 15 s and 65jC for 1 min.
Western blot assay. LNCaP and C4-2B cells were treated as above. The
cells were harvested by scraping from the wells and washed twice with cold
PBS. The cell pellet was suspended in 125 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 6.8),
sonicated for 10 s, and an equal volume of 4% SDS was added. The lysates
were boiled for 10 min. Protein concentration was determined using
bicinchoninic acid protein assay (Pierce, Rockford, IL). The proteins were
separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, blocked, and
incubated with the following primary antibodies: VEGF (1:1,000, Santa
Cruz), MMP-9 (2 Ag/mL, R&D Systems), uPA (1:500, Santa Cruz), and hactin (1:10,000, Sigma). The membrane was washed and incubated with the
respective secondary antibodies conjugated with peroxidase. Protein
detection was done with chemiluminescence detection system (Pierce).
Electrophoretic mobility shift assay for NF-KB DNA binding activity.
LNCaP and C4-2B cells were seeded in a six-well plate. After 24 h, the cells
were treated with 10 Amol/L of B-DIM or DMSO as a vehicle control and
incubated for another 24 h. Nuclear extracts were prepared according to the
method described by Wang et al. (22). For detecting NF-nB DNA binding
activity, electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) was done by incubating
3 Ag of nuclear protein of each sample with IRDye 700–labeled NF-nB
oligonucleotide (LI-COR, Lincoln, NE) as described (22). Retinoblastoma
protein was used as a protein loading control.
Invasion assay. The effects of B-DIM treatment on cell invasion were
determined using BD BioCoat Tumor Invasion Assay System (BD
Bioscience, Bedford, MA) according to the instruction of the manufacturer.
Briefly, LNCaP and C4-2B cells with serum-free media containing 10 and
25 Amol/L of B-DIM or DMSO were seeded into the upper chamber of the
system. Bottom wells were filled with complete media. After 24 h incubation,
the cells in the upper chamber were removed and the cells invaded through
the Matrigel membrane were stained with 4 Ag/mL Calcein AM in PBS at
37jC for 1 h. The fluorescently labeled cells were photographed under a
fluorescence microscope. The fluorescence of the invaded cells was read in
ULTRA Multifunctional Microplate Reader (TECAN, Durham, NC) at
excitation/emission wavelengths of 530/590 nm.
Transient transfections and reporter gene assay. The plasmid pGL3V2274 containing the VEGF promoter, enhancer, and firefly luciferase
reporter gene was kindly provided by Dr. Keping Xie (University of Texas
M. D. Anderson Cancer Center). LNCaP and C4-2B cells were seeded at a

density of 8  103 per well in 96-well plate and incubated for 24 h. The cells
were cotransfected with pGL3-V2274 or pGL3-basic plasmid and cytomegalovirus (CMV)-h-galactosidase plasmid. After 24 h of transfection, the cells
were treated with 10 Amol/L of B-DIM or DMSO as vehicle control for
another 24 h. Luciferase activity was assayed using Steady-Glo Luciferase
Assay System (Promega, Madison, WI). h-Galactosidase activity was used as
a control for transfection efficiency.
In vivo Matrigel plug angiogenesis assay. Our data showed that the
condition medium from LNCaP and C4-2B cells treated with B-DIM reduced
the tube formation of HUVECs in vitro through reduction in bioavailability
of VEGF. To assess whether B-DIM inhibits angiogenesis in vivo ,
angiogenesis assay was done using male CB17 SCID mice. The mice were
randomly segregated into two groups ( four mice per group). C4-2B cells

(4  106 in 50 AL PBS admixed with 0.25 mL Matrigel) were injected s.c. into
the bilateral flanks of each mouse (eight lesions per group). The control
group of mice was gavaged with the vehicle (sesame oil), whereas the other
group of mice was gavaged with B-DIM (5 mg/kg body weight, daily) for
4 weeks. On termination, Matrigel plugs with tumor cells were harvested
and fixed in 10% formalin dehydrated and embedded in paraffin. Matrigel
plug slices were stained with H&E and anti-CD31 antibody. SPOT Advanced
Imaging software was used to capture bright-field images. Image analyses of
the area of CD31-positive blood vessels, vessel number, and length of vessel
perimeter in each of the entire field were carried out using software image
analysis program (Scion Image downloaded from NIH website).1

Results
Reduced tube formation of HUVECs induced by conditioned
media from LNCaP and C4-2B cells treated with B-DIM. Tumor
cells can induce the formation of new blood vessels by secreting
endothelial cell specific growth factors including VEGF and FGF.
To determine whether conditioned media from LNCaP and C4-2B
cells could induce the tube formation of HUVECs and whether
conditioned media from LNCaP and C4-2B cells treated with BDIM could reduce the tube formation, we did the tube formation
assay in growth factor–reduced Matrigel in vitro. Conditioned
media from LNCaP and C4-2B cells (Fig. 1A and B) as well as VEGF
(Fig. 1C) were able to significantly induce the tube formation of
HUVECs in 6-h incubation (compared with Fig. 1C, medium only as
negative control). To further explore whether VEGF in conditioned
media may be the inducer of the tube formation of HUVECs, 10
Ag/mL of anti-VEGF neutralizing antibody was preincubated with
conditioned media from LNCaP and C4-2B cells at 37jC for 1 h and
then added into HUVECs. We found that anti-VEGF neutralizing
antibody reduced the tube formation, suggesting that VEGF is the
inducer of the tube formation induced by conditioned medium
from LNCaP and C4-2B cells (Fig. 1A). Importantly, we found that
conditioned media from LNCaP and C4-2B cells treated with 10
Amol/L of B-DIM inhibited tube formation (Fig. 1A). To rule out
the possibility that inhibition of tube formation by conditioned
media from LNCaP and C4-2B cells treated with 10 Amol/L of BDIM was mediated through direct effect of B-DIM on tube
formation of HUVECs, HUVECs grown in growth factor–reduced
Matrigel were treated with 10 Amol/L of B-DIM for 6 h (Fig. 1C). BDIM had no effect on tube formation within 6 h of incubation
(compared with Fig. 1C, DMSO control). Figure 1B and D showed
quantification of cumulative tube length of endothelial cells. These
results suggest that B-DIM treatment inhibits tube formation by
inhibiting secretion of proangiogenic factor VEGF in LNCaP and
C4-2B cells.

B-DIM reduced cellular VEGF and the secretion of VEGF. To
directly determine whether the reduced tube formation seen earlier
was a consequence of the decreased secretion of VEGF, we
analyzed the levels of VEGF in conditioned media from LNCaP and
C4-2B cells treated with B-DIM. As shown in Fig. 2A and B, 1 and
10 Amol/L of B-DIM treatment markedly decreased the VEGF
secretion from LNCaP and C4-2B cells compared with DMSO
control (P < 0.05 or 0.01). Western blot analysis showed that B-DIM
treatment reduced cellular VEGF in LNCaP cells but had no
significant effect on cellular VEGF in C4-2B cells (Fig. 2C and D).
The band with 57 kDa molecular weight corresponded with the
long intact isoforms of VEGF189 predominantly associated with
cell surface and ECM. The long VEGF189 may be the storage form,
which is released and activated by two serine proteases, uPA and
plasmin (13).
B-DIM down-regulated VEGF at the level of transcription in
LNCaP but not in C4-2B cells. Houck et al. reported that VEGF
bioavailability could be dually regulated at the genetic level by
alternative splicing of VEGF mRNA that determines whether VEGF
will be soluble or incorporated into a biological reservoir and later
activated through proteolysis after plasminogen activation (14).
VEGF121, VEGF165, and VEGF189 are the major forms secreted by
most cell types. To determine whether the decreased secretion of
VEGF from LNCaP and C4-2B cells treated with B-DIM was due to
transcription down-regulation of soluble isoforms of VEGF, such as
VEGF121 and VEGF165, we conducted real-time reverse transcription–PCR (RT-PCR) assay using isoform-specific VEGF primers and
probes and tested the relative distribution of mRNA levels of major
isoforms in LNCaP and C4-2B cells, respectively. We found that
VEGF121 is the most abundant in prostate cancer cell line LNCaP
and C4-2B cells; and VEGF165 is the lowest (Fig. 3A). Importantly,
we found that total VEGF and VEGF121 was significantly reduced
by 10 Amol/L of B-DIM treatment, but VEGF165 and VEGF189
showed less reduction at the RNA level in LNCaP cells. However,
10 Amol/L of B-DIM treatment had no significant effect on all
isoforms of VEGF mRNA in C4-2B cells (Fig. 3B). To further test
whether B-DIM reduced the VEGF expression at the transcriptional
level, we used a reporter construct, pGL3-V2274 (VEGF 5¶ flanking

region from +50 to 2274), which contains a luciferase gene driven
by the VEGF promoter. This reporter plasmid was transiently
transfected into LNCaP and C4-2B cells. After 24 h of transfection,
the cells were treated with 10 Amol/L of B-DIM for another 24 h.
The luciferase activity was determined. B-DIM treatment induced
significant decrease in luciferase activity of LNCaP but not C4-2B
cells (Fig. 3C). Therefore, we speculated that decreased soluble
VEGF in culture media from C4-2B cells treated with B-DIM may
result from regulation of posttranscription or the reduced
bioavailability of bound-VEGF, such as VEGF189 and VEGF165.
Many studies indicated that serine protease and matrix-degrading
proteases were able to release bound-VEGF into tissue culture
media (13–15). uPA and MMP-9 are respectively the key serine
protease and matrix-degrading protease involved in the regulation
of bioavailability of VEGF; thus, we have investigated whether
expression of MMP-9 could regulate the bioavailability of VEGF.
B-DIM reduced bioavailability of VEGF through repressing
MMP-9 expression. MMP-9 has been shown to be expressed at
higher levels in prostate cancer cell lines and prostate cancer
tissue. It is known to specially cleave the type IV collagen, the
major ECM, and is able to regulate bioavailability of ECM-binding

VEGF via degrading the ECM (2, 23). In this study, we determined
MMP-9 levels from conditioned media. As shown in Fig. 4A and B,
LNCaP and C4-2B cells treated with 1, 10, and 25 Amol/L of B-DIM
for 24 h resulted in significant decrease in the MMP-9 levels in
culture supernatants compared with the control (treated with
DMSO). In addition, cellular MMP-9 levels in the treated cells were
examined by Western blot analysis. As depicted in Fig. 4A and B
(bottom), B-DIM dramatically repressed the MMP-9 expression. To
explore whether reduced MMP-9 expression by B-DIM was
responsible for the decreased bioavailability of VEGF, we assayed
the VEGF levels in conditioned media from LNCaP and C4-2B cells
transfected with MMP-9 plasmid and treated with B-DIM. The
results showed that MMP-9 transfection significantly increases
VEGF levels from conditioned media compared with transfection of control plasmid in LNCaP and C4-2B cells. Importantly,
10 Amol/L of B-DIM treatment for LNCaP and C4-2B cells transfected with MMP-9 plasmid dramatically reduced the release
of VEGF (Fig. 4C and D). Western blot analysis showed that
B-DIM repressed MMP-9 expression in LNCaP and C4-2B cells
transfected with MMP-9 plasmid. These results revealed that
B-DIM could reduce bioavailability of VEGF through repressing

B-DIM Inhibits Angiogenesis and Invasion

expression of MMP-9 and regulation of
VEGF release by MMP-9. LNCaP (A)and
C4-2B (B) cells were seeded at a density of

the cells were cultured in serum-free

MMP-9 expression. Because uPA also plays an important role in the
regulation of VEGF bioavailability, we next examined the effect of
B-DIM on uPA and its consequence in VEGF bioavailability.
uPA regulated the bioavailability of the VEGF and B-DIM
repressed uPA expression in LNCaP and C4-2B cells. Many
studies have shown that uPA is involved in the angiogenesis
induced by tumors (24). uPA, directly or via plasmin formation,
leads to the release or activation of many angiogenic growth
factors, such as basic FGF (bFGF) and VEGF. In this study, downregulation of uPA by siRNA significantly repressed the release of
VEGF in LNCaP and C4-2B cells (Fig. 5A). This result suggests that
B-DIM may decrease the bioavailability of VEGF via repressing the
uPA expression. In this study, we found that 10 Amol/L of B-DIM
treatment significantly decreased the uPA expression in LNCaP and
C4-2B cells compared with DMSO control (Fig. 5B). These results
suggest that B-DIM may regulate the bioavailability of bound-VEGF
by suppressing MMP-9 and uPA expression to inhibit angiogenesis
induced by prostate cancer cells. It is known that VEGF, uPA, and
MMP-9 are transcriptionally regulated by NF-nB; thus, we have
tested whether B-DIM regulated expression of VEGF, uPA, and
MMP-9 is mediated through NF-nB.

B-DIM inhibited the NF-KB DNA binding activity. NF-nB
activation mediates expression of a large number of target genes,
such as VEGF, MMP-9, and uPA, which are involved in angiogenesis
and invasion (25). To further explore the mechanism by which BDIM regulates the expression of VEGF, MMP-9, and uPA, we
detected NF-nB DNA binding activity. Nuclear extract from cells
treated with B-DIM or DMSO control were subjected to EMSA.
Figure 5C showed that treatment with 10 Amol/L of B-DIM for
24 h strongly inhibited NF-nB DNA binding activity in both LNCaP
and C4-2B cells, suggesting that down-regulation of VEGF, MMP-9,
and uPA by B-DIM could be partly due to the inhibition of NF-nB
DNA binding activity, especially in LNCaP cells. However, the
regulatory mechanism of VEGF, MMP-9, and uPA by B-DIM in
C4-2B cells could be more complex compared with those in LNCaP
cells.
B-DIM inhibited LNCaP and C4-2B cell invasion. The levels of
VEGF, MMP-9, and uPA are known to correlate with prostate
cancer invasion and metastasis. Our previous report showed that
down-regulation of VEGF and MMP-9 by siRNA inhibited the
invasion of human pancreatic cancer cells (22). In this study, we
found that B-DIM treatment was able to lower the bioavailability of

VEGF by inhibiting MMP-9 and uPA expression and NF-nB DNA
binding activity. We have speculated that B-DIM may inhibit cell
invasion of LNCaP and C4-2B due to inactivation of NF-nB, MMP-9,
and uPA. Therefore, we did the Matrigel invasion assay. The results
showed that 10 and 25 Amol/L of B-DIM significantly inhibited
LNCaP (Fig. 6A) and C4-2B (Fig. 6B) cell invasion. These results
suggest that B-DIM inhibits LNCaP and C4-2B cell invasion by
decreasing expression or bioavailability of VEGF via inhibiting
matrix-degrading proteases, such as uPA and MMP-9.
B-DIM inhibits in vivo angiogenesis. The effect of B-DIM on
angiogenesis was investigated in vivo using a s.c. implanted Matrigel
plug assay. Histologic analysis showed that a larger number of
endothelial cells were well organized into capillary or large vascular
cavities engorged with RBC in the control group, whereas B-DIM
treatment strongly inhibited the formation of large vessels (Fig. 6C,
middle and right show histologic pictures of peripheral and deeper
areas of Matrigel plugs, respectively). In addition, B-DIM treatment
also significantly reduced the vessel number (Fig. 6D, left), vascular
area (middle) and total length of vascular perimeter (right) relative
to the control group. These results provide strong evidence in
support of the antiangiogenic activity of B-DIM in vivo, which is
believed to be partially responsible for the antitumor activity of BDIM as observed previously by our laboratory in a prostate cancer
animal model (26).

Discussion
Angiogenesis is a tightly regulated event critical for tumor growth
beyond 2 to 3 mm in diameter and is an essential component of
tumor metastasis (1). Tumor angiogenesis involves degradation of
the basement membrane of the original vessel, endothelial cell
activation, migration, proliferation and the formation of new
capillaries. All of these processes are controlled by angiogenic
factors secreted either by the tumor or the surrounding stroma.

VEGF, known as a potential angiogenic factor, is coded by a single
gene and coding region that contains eight exons separated by
seven introns (27). VEGF exists in at least six isoforms produced
through alternative splicing (6). VEGF121, VEGF165, and VEGF189
are the major forms secreted by most cell types. Exons 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
and 8 are common to all isoforms. In addition, VEGF165 contains
exon 7 and VEGF189 contains exons 6 and 7. Exons 6 and 7 have
been shown to encode the ECM-binding domain of the VEGF. This
domain is able to bind HSPGs and other matrix proteins (6). Thus,
after secretion, VEGF189 and part of VEGF165 bind to ECM and cell
membrane. Extracellular enzymes, such as heparinases, plasmin,
uPA, and MMP are able to release bound-VEGF and regulate the
VEGF bioavailability.
In the present study, we showed that conditioned media from
LNCaP and C4-2B cells induced tube formation of HUVECs.
Conditioned media from LNCaP and C4-2B cells preincubated with
anti-VEGF neutralizing antibody decreased tube formation of
HUVECs. These results suggest that VEGF secreted by prostate
cancer cells is a potential inducer of HUVEC tube formation.
Interestingly, conditioned media from LNCaP and C4-2B cells
treated with 10 Amol/L of B-DIM induced less tube formation of
HUVECs, and only the culture media containing 10 Amol/L of BDIM had no such effects on tube formation within 6 h. Therefore,
we speculate that decreased VEGF levels in conditioned media by
B-DIM treatment are responsible for reduced tube formation. As
predicted, we found that B-DIM decreased VEGF levels in
conditioned media from LNCaP and C4-2B cells. Because VEGF
is tightly regulated through transcriptional and posttranscriptional
levels, we explore the transcriptional mechanism by which B-DIM
may regulate VEGF. We did real-time RT-PCR using isoformspecific primers and probes and VEGF reporter gene assay. We
showed that B-DIM inhibited VEGF transcription in LNCaP cells
but not in C4-2B cells. Houck et al. indicated that VEGF
bioavailability could be dually regulated at the genetic level by
Figure 5. uPA regulated the release
of VEGF and B-DIM repressed uPA
expression and NF-nB DNA binding activity.

B-DIM Inhibits Angiogenesis and Invasion

Figure 6. B-DIM inhibited LNCaP
and C4-2B cell invasion and in vivo
angiogenesis. The effects of B-DIM
treatment on cell invasion were determined
by using BD BioCoat Tumor Invasion
Assay System. LNCaP (A) and C4-2B (B )
cells with serum-free media containing
10 and 25 Amol/L of B-DIM or DMSO were
seeded into the upper chamber of the
system. Bottom wells were filled with
complete media. After 24 h incubation,
the cells invaded through the Matrigel
membrane were stained with 4 Ag/mL
Calcein AM. The fluorescently labeled cells
were photographed under a fluorescence
microscope. The fluorescence of the
invaded cells was read at excitation/
emission wavelengths of 530/590 nm.

whereas the other group of mice was
gavaged with B-DIM (5 mg/kg body weight,

alternative splicing of VEGF mRNA that determines whether VEGF
will be soluble or incorporated into a biological reservoir and later
activated through proteolysis after plasminogen activation (14). It
is well known that uPA and MMP-9 can release bound-VEGF and
regulate VEGF bioavailability. In this study, we found that B-DIM
repressed the secretion of MMP-9 and protein synthesis in both cell
lines and reduced the active uPA levels in LNCaP and C4-2B cells.
These results suggest that B-DIM might inhibit tube formation of
HUVECs induced by VEGF secreted from prostate cancer cells. In
LNCaP cells, B-DIM decreased the bioactive VEGF by repressing
VEGF gene transcription and reducing the bioavailability of VEGF
bound to HSPGs in the ECM and cell membrane, which is released

due to degradation of ECM by MMP-9 and cleavage by uPA.
However, in C4-2B cells, B-DIM suppressed the bioactive VEGF
mainly by reducing the bioavailability of VEGF via decreasing uPA
and MMP-9 activity.
Increasing evidence suggests that MMP-9 contributes to the
formation of microenvironment conducive to promote tumor
growth and angiogenesis through increasing the association of
VEGF and VEGFR2 (23, 28). MMP-9 can release bound VEGF from
ECM via its proteolytic activity. Bergers et al. reported that the
regulation of VEGF in the extracellular environment is implicated
in the angiogenic switch. They found that MMP-9 could render
normal islets angiogenic releasing VEGF, whereas MMP-9 inhibitor

could reduce angiogenic switching and tumor growth (29). A recent
study has shown that VEGF bioavailability is regulated by MMPs
through intramolecular processing, in which a subset of MMPs
including MMP-9 could cleave matrix-bound isoforms of VEGF that
release soluble fragments. Furthermore, MMP-cleaved VEGF has a
distinct role in vascular patterning in tumors (15). In the current
study, we found that B-DIM inhibited the secretion of MMP-9 and
protein synthesis in both cell lines. MMP-9 transfections significantly increase VEGF levels from conditioned media compared with
transfection of control plasmid in LNCaP and C4-2B cells.
Importantly, 10 Amol/L of B-DIM treatment for LNCaP and C4-2B
cells transfected with MMP-9 plasmid dramatically reduced the
release of VEGF. Western blot analysis showed that B-DIM repressed
MMP-9 expression in LNCaP and C4-2B cells transfected with MMP-9
plasmid, which indicated that B-DIM may regulate the MMP-9
expression through posttranscriptional mechanism. In addition,
MMP-9 plasmid was constructed by inserting MMP-9 ORF into
pcDNA3.1 vector. MMP-9 expression is driven by the CMV
immediate/early promoter and enhancer containing many transcription factor binding sites, such as AP2, NF-nB, and cAMPresponsive element binding protein (30). In this study, we found that
B-DIM inhibited NF-nB DNA binding activity. Thus, B-DIM may
repress the MMP-9 expression in cells transfected with MMP-9
plasmid via inhibiting NF-nB DNA binding activity. Taken together,
these results suggest that B-DIM decreases the secretion of VEGF
and reduces the tube formation induced by tumor cells via inhibiting
MMP-9 expression, leading to decreased bioavailability of the VEGF.
uPA is a highly specific serine protease which catalyzes plasmin
formation from plasminogen. uPA, directly or via plasmin
formation, leads to the release or activation of many angiogenic
growth factors, such as bFGF and VEGF. Plouet et al. showed that
uPA was able to cleave the VEGF189 without interaction with
heparansulfate or sulfate modifications of the core proteoglycan
into a 40 kDa isoform with more active mitogen (13). Therefore,
VEGF189 released by MMP-9 via degradation of the ECM could be
a substrate for uPA, and as such uPA, together with MMP-9, plays
important roles in regulating the bioavailability of the VEGF. Plouet
et al. also found that maturation of VEGF189 by uPA cleavage
acquires the ability to activate KDR/FlK-1 (VEGFR-2). Native
VEGF189 binds to Flt-1 (VEGFR-1) but not to VEGFR-2 (13).
VEGFR-1 does not seem to transduce mitogenic signals in
endothelial cells (31). uPA cleaves native VEGF189 into a diffusible
isoform of 40 kDa with strong mitogenic activity which is able to
activate VEGFR-2 and induce proliferation (13). In this study, we
found that down-regulation of uPA by siRNA could reduce the
release of VEGF. We also found that B-DIM inhibited uPA and
MMP-9 expression, which protected native VEGF189 bound to
HSPGs from cleavage by uPA, thereby inhibiting the mitogenic
activity of VEGF for the proliferation of HUVECs.
NF-nB transcription factor is constitutively activated in prostate
cancer cells and has been shown to contribute to the development

and/or progression of prostate cancer (25). Moreover, angiogenesis,
invasion, and metastasis are necessary for the development and
progression of prostate cancer. Increasing evidence suggests that
inhibition of NF-nB activity could suppress the angiogenesis,
invasion, and metastasis by down-regulating the expression of
NF-nB downstream target genes, such as VEGF, uPA, and MMP-9
(32, 33). NF-nB is normally retained in the cytoplasm in an inactive
form, bound by inhibitory proteins called inhibitors of nB (InB) in
the most resting cells. NF-nB activation involves its release from its
inhibitor and its subsequent translocation from the cytoplasma to
the nucleus, where it binds to cognate sequences in the promoter
region of many target genes. Therefore, NF-nB DNA binding
activity is a hallmark for its activation. In this study, we found that
B-DIM treatment inhibited the NF-nB DNA binding activity and
decreased the expression of NF-nB downstream target genes, such
as VEGF, MMP-9, and uPA, leading to the reduction of HUVEC tube
formation in vitro and in vivo angiogenesis induced by the
decreased VEGF secreted from prostate cancer cells and thereby
inhibited LNCaP and C4-2B cell invasion. In a previous study, we
found that DIM reduced phosphorylation of InBa and blocked the
translocation of p65, a subunit of NF-nB to the nucleus. DNA
binding analysis and transfection studies with InB kinase cDNA
revealed that overexpression of InB kinase mediates InBa
phosphorylation, which activates NF-nB, and this activation was
completely abrogated by DIM treatment in breast cancer cells (34).
However, the exact mechanism by which B-DIM regulates the
NF-nB activity, resulting in the inhibition of angiogenesis in
prostate cancer, remains to be further investigated.
In summary, our results suggest that B-DIM reduces the
bioavailability of VEGF by inhibiting NF-nB DNA binding activity
leading to decreased MMP-9 and uPA expression, resulting in the
inhibition of angiogenesis and invasion of prostate cancer cells.
Compared with the inhibition of tube formation of HUVECs, B-DIM
exhibits more inhibitory activity on angiogenesis in vivo, suggesting
that B-DIM not only reduces the bioavailability of VEGF but also
inhibits paracrine signaling of VEGF on endothelial cells in vivo.
These results provide strong evidence in support of the antiangiogenic activity of B-DIM in vivo, which could contribute to the
antitumor activity of B-DIM as previously supported by our
laboratory in an animal model of prostate cancer (26).
