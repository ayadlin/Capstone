Abstract
MDM2 is a ubiquitin ligase that is best known for its essential
function in the negative regulation of p53. In addition, MDM2
expression is associated with tumor progression in a number
of common cancers, and in some cases, this has been shown
to be independent of p53 status. MDM2 has been shown to
promote the degradation of a number of other proteins involved in the regulation of normal cell growth and proliferation, including MDM4 and RB1. Here, we describe the
identification of a novel substrate for the MDM2 ubiquitin
ligase: dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). MDM2 binds directly
to DHFR and catalyses its monoubiquitination and not its
polyubiquitination. In addition, MDM2 expression reduces
DHFR activity in a p53-independent manner, but has no effect
upon the steady-state level of expression of DHFR. We show
that changes in MDM2 expression alter folate metabolism
in cells as evidenced by MDM2-dependent alteration in the
sensitivity of cells to the antifolate drug methotrexate.
Furthermore, we show that the ability of MDM2 to inhibit
DHFR activity depends upon an intact MDM2 RING finger. Our
studies provide for the first time a link between MDM2, an
oncogene with a critical ubiquitin ligase activity and a vital
one-carbon donor pathway involved in epigenetic regulation,
and DNA metabolism, which has wide ranging implications for
both cell biology and tumor development. [Cancer Res

Introduction
The MDM2 gene was originally identified as one of three genes
found to be amplified in tumorigenic mouse cells derived from the
NIH3T3 cell line (see ref. 1 for review of MDM2). Subsequent
studies showed that increased expression of the MDM2 gene
conferred oncogenicity upon these cells. The oncogenic consequences of up-regulation of MDM2 have since been extensively
documented. MDM2 interacts with p53, and there is compelling
evidence from a broad range of experimental systems and from
clinical studies that a major target of MDM2 oncogenic activity is
focused upon the p53 tumor suppressor protein. For example, upregulation of MDM2 often results from gene amplification and
studies of soft tissue sarcomas have found that tumors that display

MDM2 gene amplification rarely harbor p53 mutations. Studies in
cultured cells have shown that p53 levels and activity are regulated
by MDM2, and it is increasingly clear that this is substantially due
to the ability of MDM2 to act as a ubiquitin ligase with specificity
for, inter alia, p53. MDM2 targets p53 for ubiquitination, leading to
export of p53 from the nucleus and/or degradation by proteasomes. MDM2 has also been shown to inhibit p53 directly via
binding the p53 transactivation domain and indirectly, for example,
by regulating histone acetyl transferases, which acetylate both
histones and p53. Nevertheless, there is also considerable evidence
that MDM2 can exert effects on cells that are independent of p53
and, moreover, that some of these effects are also oncogenic
(reviewed in ref. 2).
Examples of evidence for these p53-independent oncogenic
effects include studies in NIH3T3 cells, in which it has been shown
that naturally occurring splice variants of MDM2 that lack the
ability to bind to p53 retain transforming activity (3). Further
support comes from studies of transgenic mice. Mice transgenic
for an MDM2 gene expressed from a h-lactoglobulin promoter
exhibited abnormal mammary development, with cells becoming
polyploid, with a multinucleate morphology suggestive of DNA
synthesis in the absence of mitosis (4). Similar results were
obtained in both p53 wild-type animals and in animals with
homozygous deletion of p53. Studies using a different transgenic
system to generate mice that overexpress MDM2 from the MDM2
promoter have shown that these animals develop a different
spectrum of tumors versus p53 null mice (5). This effect of MDM2
overexpression was similar in mice with wild-type or deleted p53.
MDM2 expression has also been shown to abrogate the growth
inhibitory activities of transforming growth factor-h1 in a p53independent manner in cells in culture (6, 7).
Not only is up-regulation of MDM2 capable of having
p53-independent oncogenic effects, but up-regulation of MDM2,
regardless of p53 status, has been shown to be a significant factor
in a range of common cancers. Increased MDM2 expression has
been found to be associated with poor outcome in studies of prostate, bladder, esophageal, and renal cancers (8–11). Up-regulation
of MDM2 frequently occurs in combination with high levels of p53.
Such coexpression of p53 and MDM2 cannot be simply explained
by our current understanding of the mechanisms underlying the
regulation of p53 or MDM2 levels in cancer cells. Further complicating this picture, there are tumor specific differences to bear
in mind, such as the strong positive association between MDM2
and p53 expression seen in renal cancer that is absent in bladder
(8, 10). Taken together, these results are compatible with
overexpression of MDM2, acting to promote cancer not only by
regulating p53, but also by acting upon additional pathways.
Most of the activities of MDM2 have been ascribed to proteinprotein interactions ( for a recent summary, see the excellent
review on p53 regulation; ref. 12), although there is evidence that

MDM2 Regulates DHFR Activity

MDM2 also interacts with RNAs (13). To try to define the p53independent activities of MDM2, we have therefore sought to
identify proteins that interact with MDM2. To accomplish this, we
developed a system that uses affinity chromatography of proteins
that interact with immobilized recombinant MDM2 protein to
purify MDM2 interacting proteins from human cells in culture,
which are then identified by mass spectrometry (MS). Using this
strategy, we have identified the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase
(DHFR; EC 1.5.1.3) as a novel MDM2 binding protein, and this
finding has been confirmed in a yeast two-hybrid screen, similar to
those we have used previously (14, 15). We have discovered that, as
a consequence of this interaction, altering MDM2 expression has
effects upon DHFR activity in cultured cells and that MDM2 can
modify DHFR in vitro. Our results show that MDM2 catalyses
monoubiquitination of DHFR and that MDM2 alters DHFR activity
in cells in a RING finger–dependent manner. Thus, increased
expression of MDM2, which occurs frequently in a range of cancers,
may have consequences not only for folate antagonism, which is of
importance in cancer treatment, but also, and perhaps, more
significantly for folate metabolism, which is intimately connected
with the methylation of nucleic acids and protein, as well as DNA
metabolism.

Materials and Methods
Plasmids and antibodies. The human MDM2 expression plasmid
hMDM2:pCMVneobam and the human RING finger mutant Cys464Ala:pCMVneobam3 were kind gifts from B. Vogelstein and D. Xirodimas,
respectively. The human DHFR cDNA was excised from pGem7Zf hDHFR
plasmid (a kind gift from N. Tai) and inserted into the pFlagCMV vector
(Sigma-Aldrich) using BamHI and ClaI restriction endonucleases. The
control plasmid for the in vitro binding assay, pTBc601c containing the
apical domain of Mycobacterium tubeculosis Cpn60.1 was a kind gift from
P. Tormay. For in vitro binding assays, the p53 cDNA expression vector was
constructed by excising a BamHI and XhoI fragment from pCEP4-p53
(16) and subcloning this into the BamHI and SalI sites of pQE31 (Qiagen).
The DHFR cDNA (murine) was expressed from pQE40 (Qiagen). MDM2
(murine) was in vitro translated from pBBV-MDM2 essentially as we have
previously (15). For yeast two-hybrid assays, the pGADT7-Rec-LargeT AD
control vector was constructed by homologous recombination in yeast
according to the manufacturer’s instructions for the Matchmaker III system
(Clontech). The pGAD-DHFR AD vector was constructed by cutting out the
DHFR cDNA from pFLAG-CMV-6b described above using EcoRV and ClaI
restriction endonucleases, and this was then ligated into the ClaI and blunt
NdeI sites of pGADT7-AD. pGBKT7-MDM2 was prepared by subcloning
a blunt ended NcoI fragment from pBlueBac-His2 (Invitrogen) into the
blunted SalI site of pGBKT7. For in vitro ubiquitination assays, the glutathione S-transferase (GST)–MDM2 expression vector was constructed by
excising a BamHI fragment from hMDM2:pCMVneobam and subcloning
this into pGEX2TK (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The mouse monoclonal antibody for MDM2, (SMP-14), monoclonal antibody for h-actin (C-2),
goat polyclonal antibody E-18, rabbit polyclonal Fl-187 for DHFR, and rabbit
polyclonal antibody for S-probe (K-14) were purchased from Santa Cruz
Biotechnology. The mouse monoclonal antibody for the FLAG epitope (M2)
was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. The rabbit polyclonal for DHFR
(ab49880) was obtained from Abcam. The mouse monoclonal antibodies
for MDM2 (IF2) and h-galactosidase (Ab-1) were purchased from Oncogene.
The mouse monoclonal for the HA tag (16B12) was obtained from Covance
Research Products. The anti-CD20 (Leu16) antibody was purchased from
Becton Dickinson. Secondary antibodies used were antimouse used at a
dilution of 1:2,500, antirabbit used at a dilution of 1:5,000 (both from
Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and antigoat used at 1:20,000 dilution
(Jackson Immunochemicals).
Cell culture and transfection. H1299 (p53 null, non–small cell lung
carcinoma) and H1299-9 (overexpressing MDM2) were maintained in RPMI

www.aacrjournals.org

1640 supplemented with 10% FCS. MCF-7 and HEK 293 cells were
maintained in DMEM HEPES modification supplemented with 10% FCS
and 2 mmol/L L-glutamine (Sigma-Aldrich).
Cells were routinely transfected using Genejuice (Novagen) at 3 AL/Ag
of DNA with empty vectors added to ensure equal DNA content in
transfections. In some experiments, Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) was
used instead as a delivery agent at 2.5 AL/Ag of DNA. When indicated,
MG115 (10 Amol/L) was added 3 h before harvesting. Small interfering
RNA (siRNA) was delivered to cells using Lipofectamine 2000 according
to the manufacturer’s instructions: siRNAs (Dharmacon) for MDM2;
MDM2#1 (5¶GCCACAAAUCUGAUAGUA), MDM2#2 (Smartpool, L003279),
p53 (5¶GCAUGAACCGGAGGCCCA), scrambled siRNA (5¶GGACGCAUCCUUCUUAAU), nontarget siRNA (D001810-01), RISC-free siRNA#1
(D001220-01).
The response of H1299 and H1299-9 cells to methotrexate was determined by seeding the cells at 15% confluency and then treating with either
carrier (3 Amol/L NaOH) or 30 nmol/L methotrexate in carrier 24 h later.
Cells were harvested every 24 h and counted using a Beckman Coulter Z2
counter.
Preparation of columns. We used an Amersham Biosciences AKTAPrime fast protein liquid chromatography with a 1-mL HiTrap chelating
column at a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min maintained at 4jC. His6-rMDM2 was
prepared as described previously (15), except that it was purified using a
HiTrap chelating column eluted into buffer E [8 mol/L urea, 0.1 mol/L
NaH2PO4, 0.01mol/L Tris-HCl (pH 4.5)], and pH was then adjusted to 9.0 for
use. The column used for isolating MDM2 interacting proteins was primed
by adding 5 mL of 100 Amol/L NiSO4, and the excess was removed by
washing with 10 column volumes (CV) of SLIP buffer [50 mmol/L HEPES
(pH 7.5), 10% glycerol, 0.1% Triton-X100, 150 mmol/L NaCl]. His6-rMDM2
(0.5 mg/mL) in 10 mL SLIP buffer was then applied to the column by
continuous recirculation for 16 h. The column was washed with 20 CV SLIP
buffer and blocked with 1 mg/mL bovine serum albumin (BSA) in 12 mL
SLIP buffer for 16 h before application of 15 mg of filtered HEK 293 cell
cleared lysate also for 16 h. The column was washed with 50 CVs SLIP buffer
and exposed to a 0 to 1mol/L imidazole gradient, and the eluate was
collected in 3-mL fractions. A control column was set up using BSA as both
binding and blocking agent. Column samples were matched for imidazole
concentration, and protein sample buffer [final concentration, 50 mmol/L
Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 0.25% h-mercaptoethanol,
bromophenol blue (1 mg/mL)] was added before analysis by Western
blotting and/or mass spectroscopy.
Mass spectroscopy. Eluted proteins from MDM2 column fractions 5 and
6 were separated by SDS-PAGE and stained using brilliant blue G colloidal
stain. Protein bands were excised, the band was chopped into small pieces,
and manual in-gel tryptic digests were performed as described elsewhere
(17). The tryptic digest was delivered into a QSTAR Pulsar i hybrid mass
spectrometer (Applied Biosystems) by automated in-line RP-LC (integrated
LC Packings System, 5 mm C18 A-precolumn cartridge, and 75 Am  15 cm
C18 column, Dionex) via a nanoelectrospray source head and a 10-Am id
PicoTip (New Objective). A gradient from 5% acetonitrile:0.05% trifluoroacetic acid v/v to 48% ACN:0.05% trifluoroacetic acid v/v in 60 min was
applied at a rate of 200 nL/min, and MS and MS/MS spectra were acquired
for 3 s in positive ion mode using information-dependent acquisition
(Analyst software, Applied Biosystems). Data was submitted to MASCOT,
and the National Center for Biotechnology Information database was
searched with the MS tolerance set at 1.2 Da and the MS/MS tolerance at
0.6 Da with no modifications allowed.
Western blot analysis. Column fractions were analyzed as follows:
samples in 1 protein sample buffer were separated by SDS-PAGE and
transferred to Hybond enhanced chemiluminescence nitrocellulose membrane. Membranes were blocked in PBS-Tween 20 (0.1% v/v) containing
nonfat dry milk (5% w/v) for 1 h at room temperature before incubation
with primary antibodies (3 Ag/mL). Membranes were washed thrice for
15 min in PBS-Tween 20 before addition of horseradish peroxidase–
conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. Membranes
were washed as before, and the signal was detected by chemiluminescence
and recorded using a Kodak IM4000 image station or autoradiography.

Cell pellets were lysed in SLIP buffer in the presence of the following
protease inhibitors: aprotinin (2 Ag/mL), leupeptin (0.5 Ag/mL), pepstatin
A (1 Ag/mL), soybean trypsin inhibitor (100 Ag/mL), and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mmol/L). After 10-min incubation on ice, lysates were
centrifuged at 20,000  g, and protein concentrations in the supernatant
were determined using Bradford reagent. Typically, 50 Ag samples were
analyzed.
In vitro binding assay. To produce recombinant His-tagged proteins, we
used essentially the same procedure we have previously (15). His-tagged
protein/NTA agarose (Qiagen) bead complex (20 AL) was diluted into 1 mL
of Dignam buffer plus imidazole [20 mmol/L HEPES (pH 7.9), 0.1mol/L KCl,
20% glycerol, 0.5 mmol/L DTT], with 50 mmol/L imidazole plus protease
inhibitors, and 10 AL of in vitro translated protein were added and incubated at 25jC for 3 h. The beads were washed five times in 1 mL of Dignam
buffer plus imidazole, resuspended in 30 AL 1 protein sample buffer, and
analyzed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography.
Yeast two-hybrid screening. Yeast two-hybrid screening was performed
essentially as recommended for the Matchmaker III system (Clontech). All
pGAD vectors used were transformed into AH109, and all pGBKT7 strains
were transformed into Y187 so that combinations could be generated
through mating.
Immunopreciptiation. Clarified cellular lysate was precleared by
incubating with protein G–Sepharose beads for 1 h at 4jC. Precleared
supernatants were then incubated with either 2 Ag anti-MDM2 N20, 2 Ag
anti-Flag M2, or with the same amount of anti–h-actin or anti-CD20
(Leu16), respectively, for 1 h at 4jC. After this, lysates were incubated with
protein G–Sepharose beads for 2 h at 4jC, and the bead pellets were washed
extensively in SLIP buffer and resuspended in 1 protein sample buffer
before analysis by Western blotting.
DHFR activity assay. Cells were harvested by trypsinization, and DHFR
activity was measured using the DHFR assay kit (Sigma-Aldrich) as per the
manufacturer’s instructions. Typically, 400 Ag of total protein were assayed
for DHFR activity using a Biochrom Libra S32 spectrophotometer
measuring the decrease in absorbance at 340 nm every 15 s over 8 min.
Flow cytometry. Apoptosis was determined by flow cytometry using an
Annexin V FITC apoptosis detection kit (Sigma-Aldrich) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Samples were analyzed using a Beckman
Coulter Epics XL flow cytometer using FL1 (FITC) and FL2 (propidium
iodide) channels. Data were analyzed using WIN MDI software (Windows
multiple document interface for flow cytometry; Scripps Research
Institute).
Ubiquitination assay. Ubiquitination reactions (18) were performed
in a 100-AL reaction volume containing 50 mmol/L Tris-HCL (pH 7.5),
0.5 mmol/L MgCl2, 2 mmol/L ATP, 2 mmol/L DTT, 20 Amol/L ZnCl2, 100 ng
E1, 400 ng UbcH5B, and 10 Ag ubiquitin (proteins from Boston Biochem) to
which 200 ng GST-MDM2 or GST were added. GST and GST-MDM2 proteins
were purified from Escherichia coli using reduced glutathione sepharose
4B beads and eluted into SLIP buffer containing 20 mmol/L glutathione
essentially as described by the manufacturers (Amersham). Recombinant
DHFR (Sigma) was dialyzed into SLIP buffer before addition to the reaction.
Reactions were performed with freshly prepared GST-MDM2 or GST at 30jC
overnight, and proteins were subsequently analyzed by Western blotting as
described.

Results
DHFR is an MDM2 binding protein. To identify MDM2
interacting proteins, we have expressed His6-tagged recombinant
human MDM2 (His6-rMDM2) in E. coli and then used the purified
protein to generate a column for affinity chromatography. HEK 293
cells were selected for this study as not being derived from a tumor,
and possessing wild-type p53, they are relatively normal immortal
cells. His6-rMDM2 was applied to a nickel-charged column and
washed extensively, and a clarified HEK 293 cell lysate was then
passed over the column. The column was washed extensively to
remove low affinity/nonspecifically associated/retained proteins.

Proteins bound to MDM2 were then eluted with an imidazole
gradient, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and visualized by staining with
brilliant blue G colloidal protein stain. In Fig. 1A, the majority of
MDM2 elutes in fractions corresponding to 168 to 252 mmol/L
imidazole. There is relatively little protein detectable in this region
of the control column fractions (compare Fig. 1A with B) and no
detectable MDM2 in the equivalent fractions. Selected prominent
bands obtained from fractions 5 and 6 from the MDM2 column
were excised and subjected to nano-LC-ESI (electrospray ionization)-MS/MS analysis, and as indicated in Fig. 1C, one of these
bands was identified as DHFR (EC 1.5.1.3 gi:47939629, REFSEQ
gi:4503323, Mascot: MOWSE score 120, 18% peptide coverage and
ProteinPilot, 8 peptides 55.6% coverage). Having obtained identification for DHFR, we subsequently performed Western blot
analysis of column fractions from the MDM2 and control columns
with an antibody for DHFR, and in Fig. 1A, we found that DHFR
coelutes with MDM2 in fractions containing up to 210 to 252
mmol/L imidazole (see also Supplementary Fig. S1, which shows
the results with two additional DHFR antibodies). There is no
detectable MDM2 or DHFR in the equivalent fractions on the
BSA control column (see Fig. 1B and Supplementary Fig. 1). From
Fig. 1A, it is apparent that MDM2 is equally abundant in fractions
5 and 6, whereas DHFR is most abundant in fraction 6. These
differences between the elution profiles of DHFR and MDM2 may
reflect the presence of differing levels of MDM2 containing complexes in these fractions. This notion accords with data presented
in Supplementary Fig. S2, wherein we have probed these fractions
for a subset of known MDM2 binding proteins. We have found that
p53 and MTBP are present predominantly in fraction 6, gankyrin
and pRb are present predominantly in fraction 5, whereas MDMX is
detected equally in both fractions 5 and 6. To determine whether
the interaction between MDM2 and DHFR was the result of direct
protein-protein interaction, we performed an in vitro binding assay
similar to ones we have previously described (14, 15) using
recombinant test protein mixed with in vitro translated MDM2. In
Fig. 2A, recombinant DHFR binds to MDM2 to a comparable extent
to recombinant p53 under these conditions, whereas an irrelevant
peptide from Cpn60 does not bind to MDM2. Thus, we conclude
that MDM2 and DHFR can interact directly. We have also found
that the interaction between MDM2 and DHFR can be shown using
a yeast two-hybrid screen. Figure 2B shows yeast growth and hgalactosidase reporter activity on quadruple dropout plates for
both DHFR and MDM2 with empty vector–transfected yeast
controls and, for comparison, SV40 large T and murine p53. This
heterologous system provides further support for the direct nature
of this interaction. Next, we performed immunoprecipitations to
determine whether we could detect the presence of MDM2 and
DHFR in a complex in cells. H1299 cells were transfected with
MDM2 and/or DHFR (Flag tagged), and as illustrated in Fig. 2C,
MDM2 protein was precipitated when an anti-Flag antibody was
used for immunoprecipitation in a Flag-DHFR–dependent manner.
Note that the level of MDM2 is much higher in cells transfected
with MDM2; hence, the absence on this short exposure of an
endogenous MDM2 band in cells only transfected with DHFR and
immunoprecipitated with an antibody for MDM2. To further investigate the presence of a protein complex containing endogenous
MDM2 and DHFR, we performed similar experiments in untransfected HEK 293 cells. Figure 2D shows that MDM2 can be detected
after immunoprecipitation with a DHFR antibody (bottom) and the
interaction is also detectable after the reciprocal experiment (note
that there is 10 times as much DHFR precipitate loaded versus the

MDM2 precipitation on the bottom), and thus, <10% of the MDM2
precipitated with an MDM2 antibody coprecipitated with DHFR.
Because only a very small proportion of the DHFR present is
precipitated with the available antibodies (we have tested four;

data not shown), it is noteworthy that a considerable proportion of
this is associated with MDM2. Thus, these studies show that
MDM2 and DHFR can be coimmunoprecipitated and can exist in a
complex in cells.

interacting protein. A, elution profile from an MDM2
column. Fifteen milligrams of an HEK 293 clarified cell
lysate were passed over a column coated with 4 mg
of recombinant His6-MDM2. After extensive washing
to remove nonspecific proteins in a 10 mmol/L
imidazole buffer, the MDM2 (and interacting proteins)
was removed from the column with an increasing
concentration of imidazole. Eluted fractions were
resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed for total protein
by staining with brilliant blue G colloidal stain and for
MDM2 (and subsequently DHFR) by immunoblotting
with IF2 and E-18, respectively. The main DHFR band
detected by immunoblotting is indicated with an

between three different DHFR antibodies; see

the results shown are from a single typical
experiment.

MDM2 reduces the activity of DHFR. MDM2 possesses
ubiquitin ligase activity, and ubiquitination has been shown to be
involved in both the regulation of protein stability and the
posttranslational regulation of protein function. Because MDM2
has been shown to regulate the turnover of p53, MDM4, Numb, h2
arrestin, and RB1 (19–24), we first investigated whether MDM2
might regulate the stability of DHFR. However, in Fig. 3A and B,
we have found no evidence for this in either plasmid transfection
or siRNA knockdown experiments in a range of cell lines. Thus, we
conclude that MDM2 does not regulate the stability of DHFR.

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (9). May 1, 2008

We next investigated whether MDM2 could alter the activity of
DHFR in cells. To examine this in the absence of potentially
confounding effects of p53, we selected a p53 null human cell line
(H1299) for these studies. We were fortunate to have previously
obtained a derivative of these cells (H1299-clone 9) that stably
expresses high levels of MDM2, but which exhibits similar growth
characteristics (see Fig. 3C), and thus, we were able to compare the
effect of stable expression of MDM2 in isogenic cells. Figure 3D
shows that the clone 9 cells expressing higher levels of MDM2
clearly have lower levels of DHFR activity. Note, however, that, in

accordance with our results shown in Fig. 3A and B, these cells
have comparable steady-state levels of DHFR protein. Our results
suggest that increased levels of MDM2 can alter DHFR activity in
cells in a p53-independent manner. To examine this further, we
used transfection of siRNA for MDM2 to reduce MDM2 levels in
cells, so that we could measure the effect of these changes upon
DHFR activity. Using siRNA, we could significantly reduce the level
of endogenous MDM2 with either a single siRNA (#1) or with a pool
of unrelated siRNAs (#2), and concomitantly, we observed a significant increase in DHFR activity as in Fig. 4A. No effect was observed
when either a scrambled siRNA (matched to MDM2 siRNA#1) or
an siRNA for p53 was used. We also examined another cell line,
MCF-7, that harbors wild-type p53, and although we cannot rule
out an indirect effect of MDM2 mediated through p53 in these
cells, we observed similar effects of MDM2 knockdown upon DHFR
activity to those we had observed in p53 null cells, as in Fig. 4C.
Taken together, these results show that MDM2 inhibits cellular
DHFR activity in a p53-independent manner.
MDM2 expression alters cellular sensitivity to the antifolate
drug methotrexate. Because DHFR catalyses the regeneration of
tetrahydrofolate as a one-carbon donor for thymidine synthesis, it
is an important drug target, and several specific drugs have been
developed to inhibit DHFR activity, not least of which is the original

antifolate drug methotrexate (reviewed in ref. 25). Antifolates
continue to be used as part of treatment regimens for a range of
cancers. Indeed, newer compounds have been shown to be useful
therapies for patients with previously poor responses to this class
of agents, such as those with non–small cell lung carcinomas (26).
The classic mechanism by which cancer cells acquire resistance to
methotrexate is through gene amplification (27, 28); however,
several studies have shown that point mutations in the DHFR gene
can reduce the K m for methotrexate by >100-fold, while having
almost no effect on the K m for dihydrofolate (29–31). Therefore,
measuring cellular sensitivity to methotrexate can be used as an
additional surrogate indicator of alterations in DHFR activity in
response to changes in MDM2 expression.
H1299 clone 9 cells have comparable levels of DHFR protein to
the parental H1299 line, but this protein displays reduced activity
in a dihydrofolate reduction assay (as shown in Fig. 3D). As Fig. 5A
shows, we observe that H1299 clone 9 cells are significantly more
resistant to methotrexate than the parental H1299 cells, and this
is apparent across a range of methotrexate concentrations (not
shown). We further analyzed these data to determine the growth
rates of these cells in the presence and absence of 30 nmol/L
methotrexate, and as Fig. 5B shows, there is a statistically significant difference in the effect of methotrexate upon the growth rate

of H1299 and H1299 clone 9 cells. To determine whether methotrexate was differentially inducing apoptosis in these cells, we
performed flow cytometry to measure Annexin V binding and
propidium iodide staining of H1299 and H1299 clone 9 cells treated
for 48 hours with either 0, 25, or 30 nmol/L methotrexate. Figure 5C
shows that clone 9 cells are more resistant to apoptosis. The results
presented are qualitatively similar to results obtained in studies
of p14ARF, with decreased DHFR leading, counterintuitively, to
increased resistance to methotrexate (32). These data provide
additional confirmation that MDM2 alters the regulation of folate
metabolism by DHFR.
MDM2 monoubiquitinates DHFR. If MDM2 alters the activity
of DHFR, and because it has E3 ubiquitin ligase activity but does
not promote the degradation of DHFR, then it seemed likely that
this was due to MDM2-mediated conjugation of ubiquitin to DHFR.
To investigate whether DHFR is a substrate for MDM2-catalysed
ubiquitin conjugation, we established an in vitro ubiquitination
assay based upon recombinant GST-MDM2 produced in E. coli (18).
Figure 6A shows the results of a typical in vitro ubiquitination
reaction containing DHFR and GST-MDM2 or GST as indicated,
and Fig. 6B shows the purified proteins used for the assay. Transfer
of ubiquitin to DHFR is catalysed by GST-MDM2 but not by GST,
and the more slowly migrating monoubiquitinated form of DHFR
only appeared when both GST-MDM2 and ubiquitin were added
to the reaction, thus demonstrating that this is DHFR-ubiquitin.
Thus, we conclude that MDM2 catalyses the monoubiquitination of
DHFR in vitro. These results are in accordance with those in Figs. 1
to 3 which showed that MDM2 interacts directly with DHFR but
does not promote its degradation.

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (9). May 1, 2008

Regulation of DHFR activity by MDM2 depends upon an
intact RING finger domain. Monoubiquitination has been shown
to be functionally important in regulating a range of cellular
processes, including chromatin remodeling, regulation of DNA
metabolism (particularly DNA repair), and receptor endocytosis
(reviewed in ref. 33). We wanted to determine whether the inhibitory effect of MDM2 upon DHFR that we had observed depended
upon the MDM2 RING finger, because this domain is essential for
MDM2 E3 ligase activity that catalyses DHFR monoubiquitination.
To accomplish this, we first needed to establish whether transient
expression of MDM2 could alter endogenous DHFR activity.
Because we had previously observed an effect of MDM2 reducing
DHFR activity in cells that stably overexpress MDM2 (see Fig. 3D)
and had also observed the reciprocal effect of increasing DHFR
activity after knockdown of MDM2 in cells, we anticipated that
transient transfection of H1299 cells with a plasmid that expresses
MDM2 would also lead to a reduction in DHFR activity. As Fig. 6C
shows, we found that under conditions in which >80% of cells have
been transfected with an MDM2 expression construct (transfection
efficiency determined by cotransfection with a h-galactosidase
expression vector and in situ h-galactosidase staining), we observe
a significant reduction in DHFR activity. Because MDM2 catalyses
the monoubiquitination of DHFR in vitro, we would expect that
transient transfection of a RING finger mutant of MDM2 would not
affect DHFR activity. Figure 6D shows that this is indeed the case
and that the effect of MDM2 upon DHFR is dose dependent. We
therefore conclude that MDM2 modulates DHFR activity in cells
through direct covalent modification of DHFR with ubiquitin in a
dose-dependent manner.

MDM2 Regulates DHFR Activity

Discussion
MDM2 is an oncogene that has both p53-dependent and p53independent oncogenic activities. To identify mechanisms through
which the observed up-regulation of MDM2 promotes cancer
progression, we have focused upon the identification of cellular
targets of MDM2. Most of the identified activities of MDM2
depend upon protein-protein interactions, and there are a number

of systems that have been used successfully to identify these. The
chromatographic approach we have used here isolates proteins that
bind to recombinant MDM2 that are likely to be in their native
conformation and which are not themselves tagged or fused to
heterologous peptides. Confirmation of identified interactions using
a yeast two-hybrid screen shows that the interaction (in this case
between MDM2 and DHFR) can occur inside viable eukaryotic cells.

Figure 5. MDM2 expression alters cellular sensitivity
to the antifolate drug methotrexate. A, H1299 and
H1299 clone 9 (Clone 9 ) cells were cultured for the
indicated times and exposed to 30 nmol/L
methotrexate or to mock treatment with the drug
vehicle (DMSO). Samples were counted using
a Coulter counter. Columns, mean; bars, SE. Six
independent cultures were counted at each time point
for each condition (n = 6). The experiment has been
repeated thrice, and the results shown are from a
single typical experiment. B, log phase growth rates

H1299 + MTX, 0.88; Clone 9 + MTX, 0.94) indicate
that the time points selected are within a log-growth
phase. Columns, growth rates (1/d); bars, SE.

In both these systems, the potential exists (albeit unlikely in the
yeast two-hybrid screen) for the interaction to be mediated by other
protein/s, but our in vitro binding data shows that this interaction
requires no additional components, and this is further supported by
in vitro ubiquitination assays. MDM2 possesses ubiquitin ligase
activity, and this is responsible for promoting the proteasomal
degradation of a growing list of proteins that includes p53, MDM2,
MDM4, Numb, RB1, HipK2, and Tip60 (reviewed in ref. 12). In
addition to regulating protein stability through targeting proteins to
proteasomes, ubiquitination is a posttranslational modification that
plays a key role in a number of important cellular processes,

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (9). May 1, 2008

including chromatin remodeling, regulation of DNA metabolism,
and receptor endocytosis. MDM2 has also been implicated in such
regulation, for example MDM2 has been shown to bind to and to
ubiquitinate h-arrestin and through this to contribute to internalization of h2-adrenergic receptor (24). Although MDM2 promotes
degradation of a number of proteins, studies of the MDM2mediated degradation of p53 have found that MDM2 only promotes
efficient polyubiquitination in the presence of a cofactor (p300) and
in the absence of this MDM2 promotes monoubiquitination (34).
Monoubiquitination has been shown to be a critical regulatory
event in several cellular processes, an example being the regulation

MDM2 Regulates DHFR Activity

of DNA repair; after DNA damage, monoubiquitination of
proliferating cell nuclear antigen, catalysed by Rad18, plays a role
in switching activity from replicative to translesion synthetic DNA
polymerases at stalled replication forks (reviewed in ref. 35). We
have found that binding of MDM2 to DHFR does not regulate the
stability of DHFR; indeed, experiments with inhibitors of proteasomal degradation showed that DHFR stability is not regulated in
this way (Fig. 3B).3 Rather, modulating MDM2 levels show that
MDM2 has a direct effect upon cellular DHFR activity. This is
further supported by our experiments with the antifolate drug
methotrexate, in which resistance to the drug acts as a surrogate
for MDM2-mediated regulation of DHFR activity. In vitro, we can
see that MDM2 directly catalyses the monoubiquitination of DHFR,
and in cells in culture, modification of DHFR by MDM2 is shown
to be necessary for MDM2-mediated regulation of DHFR because
this effect is abolished by a mutation in the RING finger domain
of MDM2. Our results with siRNA and overexpression of MDM2
suggest that the latter may have a more profound effect upon
DHFR activity. This is compatible with DHFR inhibition being a
target of the p53-independent oncogenic effects that result from
overexpression of MDM2.
DHFR catalyses the conversion of dihydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate, an essential intermediate carrier of one-carbon groups used
ubiquitously in mammalian cells. Methylation is important for both
biosynthesis of purine and pyrimidine bases required for DNA
synthesis and also for epigenetic regulation via modification of
nucleic acids and proteins. Folate metabolism is closely linked with
the regulation (and in diseases, such as cancer, of deregulation) of
methylation (see ref. 36 for review).
Our discovery that MDM2 regulates DHFR activity through
direct monoubiquitination links MDM2 with the regulation of
folate metabolism and thus potentially with aspects of methylation
and epigenetic regulation. High levels of MDM2 are rarely, if ever,
tolerated in normal cells (5), although the reason for this is
unknown (it has been suggested that loss of p53 function may
render cells more tolerant to the negative effects of increased
MDM2 expression; ref. 37). We have shown that MDM2 upregulation inhibits DHFR and thus would be expected to have a
negative effect upon folate metabolism. Changes in dietary folate
have been shown to have some surprising consequences; for
example, low dietary folate has been linked with increased
CDKN2A (p16INK4a) promoter hypermethylation and an increased
risk of cancer (38). Similarly, we have observed, as others have, that
a reduction in DHFR can lead to an increase in resistance to
methotrexate (32). Thus, changes in folate metabolism do not
always result in the anticipated consequences. Moreover, experiments using chemicals that have fairly well-defined pharmacologic
properties, such as 5-azacytidine, have also produced results that
would not be expected a priori. For example, whereas 5-azacytidine
has been routinely used to de-methylate a number of genes and
to induce global hypomethylation of DNA (39), there are good
examples of genes becoming hypermethylated after the addition of
this agent (40). It is clear from such observations therefore that it is
not trivial to try to anticipate the phenotype of alterations in folate
metabolism (25). Nevertheless, we might anticipate that high levels
of MDM2 would be linked with a phenotype that resembles low

dietary folate. In rats, a chronic reduction in dietary components
of methyl-donor pathways ( folate, methionine, and choline) leads
to global DNA hypomethylation and to cancer with a strong
correlation between tissue susceptibility to cancer and induction of
global hypomethylation (41). Additionally, in mice with a predisposition to develop colorectal cancer (Apc +/ , Msh2 / ), it has
also been shown that diets supplemented with folate significantly
suppress early events in colorectal carcinogenesis (42). Thus,
if MDM2 has a negative effect upon the availability of tetrahydrofolate, we anticipate that this would contribute to global hypomethylation and/or specific tumor suppressor gene promoter
hypermethylation and thus contribute to carcinogenesis.
In addition to regulation of folate metabolism for methylation of
DNA, DHFR activity is required to provide one-carbon groups for
histone methylation and for the biosynthesis of both purine and
pyrimidine bases and thus for DNA replication ( for review, see
ref. 43). Histone methylation is linked to the regulation of chromatin structure and gene regulation. Whereas the effect of folate
deficiency upon this has not been extensively studied, it has been
shown that inhibition of specific methyl-transferases leads to
promoter hypomethylation with resultant up-regulation of gene
expression with concomitant changes in histone methylation (44).
Thus, the changes in DNA methylation observed to follow from
folate deficiency might well be linked to alterations in histone
methylation.
In addition to its ability to negatively regulate p53, MDM2
interacts with several molecules that have a role in the regulation
of the G1 checkpoint and S-phase progression (1) and which are
thus linked via DNA synthesis and therefore necessarily with folate
metabolism. For example, MDM2 has been shown to promote
S-phase entry by binding to RB1 promoting its degradation and
stimulating E2F1 (45–47). In addition, we have previously identified
a direct effect of MDM2 in stimulating DNA polymerase q (15, 48),
an essential molecule with a poorly understood role in DNA
synthesis in mammalian cells. This function of MDM2 in promoting cell cycle progression seems to run counter to that we have
identified, because this might be anticipated to have an inhibitory
effect on DNA synthesis. Given the unpredictable consequences of
alterations in folate metabolism described above, it is likely that
this simplistic argument cannot be relied upon to withstand
further experimental investigation.
In conclusion, folate metabolism plays an important role in a
wide range of physiologic and pathophysiologic processes, and
thus, the effect of MDM2 upon DHFR that we have identified may
have implications for any number of these. MDM2 alters DHFR
activity in a p53-independent manner and high levels of MDM2 are
associated with poor prognosis in a number of cancers independently of p53 status. Our results identify a novel p53-independent
activity for MDM2 in regulating folate metabolism in a manner
that has been shown to alter epigenetic regulation and promote
cancer.
