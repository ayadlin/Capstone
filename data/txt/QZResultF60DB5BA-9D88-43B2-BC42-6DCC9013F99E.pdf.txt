ABSTRACT
Galectins are small soluble lectins that bind a-galactosides via their carbohydrate
recognition domain (CRD). Their ability to dimerize is critical for the crosslinking
of glycoprotein receptors and subsequent cellular signaling. This is particularly
important in their immunomodulatory role via the induction of T-cell apoptosis.
Because galectins play a central role in many pathologies, including cancer, they
represent valuable therapeutic targets. At present, most inhibitors have been directed
towards the CRD, a challenging task in terms of specificity given the high structural
homology of the CRD among galectins. Such inhibitors are not effective at targeting
CRD-independent functions of galectins. Here, we report a new class of galectin
inhibitors that specifically binds human galectin-7 (hGal-7), disrupts the formation
of homodimers, and inhibits the pro-apoptotic activity of hGal-7 on Jurkat T cells. In
addition to representing a new means to achieve specificity when targeting galectins,
such inhibitors provide a promising alternative to more conventional galectin
inhibitors that target the CRD with soluble glycans or other small molecular weight
allosteric inhibitors.

sequence homology among their carbohydrate-binding
domains (CRDs) [5]. Fifteen different members have
been identified and divided in three sub-groups according
to their structure: prototype galectins containing one CRD
(Gal-1, -2, -5, -7, -10, -13, -14 and -15), tandem-repeat
galectins containing two-CRDs covalently linked (Gal-4,
-6, -8, -9 and -12) and a chimera-type galectin containing
multiple CRDs linked by their amino-terminal domain
(Gal-3) [6]. While these proteins perform homeostatic
functions inside normal cells, under pathological or stress
conditions, cytosolic galectins are released either passively
from dead cells or actively via non-classical secretion
pathways [7]. Once in the extracellular milieu, they bind
all glycosylated growth receptors on the surface of normal
and cancer cells to set their signaling threshold [8, 9]. Such
properties enable galectins to kill infiltrating immune cells
while promoting growth of tumour cells [9]. Galectins
are thus ideal targets for effective therapeutics, and new
approaches are therefore being developed to modulate
their activities [10]. These avenues have focused mainly
on carbohydrate-based inhibitors disrupting extracellular

INTRODUCTION
Cancer is a complex pathology manifested by
uncontrolled growth of cells that have undergone various
transformations from physiologically normal cells. Several
hallmarks provide a methodical and rational approach in
studying this disease, namely the sustaining of proliferative
signaling, evasion of growth suppressors, resistance to cell
death, replicative immortality, angiogenesis, activation of
invasion, and metastasis [1]. In recent years, however,
strong evidence has highlighted the critical roles of
immune cells present in the tumor micro-environment
[2, 3]. For instance, one way that tumor cells can modulate
and escape immune destruction is by secretion of various
factors such as pro-inflammatory eicosanoids, cytokines,
chemokines and other soluble signaling molecules leading
to the formation of an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment [4].
Galectins are multifunctional proteins belonging to
the animal lectin family. All galectins share similar binding
affinities to β-galactosides and display high amino acid

galectins, which form multivalent complexes with cell
surface glycoconjugates to deliver CRD-dependent
intracellular signals that modulate cell activation and
survival/apoptosis. Despite decades of research, however,
the progression in this field has been very slow. In most
cases, these inhibitors are high molecular weight, naturally
occurring polysaccharides that are used to specifically
block the binding of extracellular galectins to carbohydrate
structures [11–14]. Unfortunately, such inhibitors often
display low affinity, lack of selectivity for a given galectin
due to highly conserved homology among galectin CRDs,
and are not effective at targeting CRD-independent
functions of galectins. Indeed, several studies have shown
that several critical biological processes of galectins are
mediated via CRD-independent interactions [15–18].
Sequencing of galectins isolated from amphibians,
birds, fish, and mammals has revealed extensive sequence
similarity [19, 20]. In addition to the presence of a CRD,
all galectins harbor a highly conserved three-dimensional
structure characterized by a jelly-roll topology composed
of an 11- or 12-strand anti-parallel β-sandwich of
approximately 135–140 amino acid residues [21]. One
of the most common and important structural features
associated with galectin function is their ability to form
homodimers (Fig. 1B). This is particularly true for the
prototype galectins, which consist of two ~14–15 kDa
subunits that are non-covalently associated in a monomerdimer equilibrium [22]. Studies of ancestral structures
of fish galectins have indeed shown that galectins have
gone through selective pressure for stabilizing this
homodimer structure to increase their affinity for their
ligand(s) [23]. Such multivalency is critical for galectins
to trigger intracellular signaling following their binding
to cell surface receptors [24–26]. In the present work,
we report a novel peptide-based galectin inhibitor that
was specifically designed to disrupt the formation of
galectin-7 dimers and its pro-apoptotic function.

their analysis revealed that certain residues were likely to
be involved in the dimerization of hGal-7, most notably
residues R14, R20, R22, E87, L89, D94, D95, D103,
A104, Q105, D130 and F135. These residues appear to
symmetrically associate with their respective partner on
the second monomer through H-bonding, electrostatic
or hydrophobic interactions, or via the formation of
disulfide bridges. As such, the peptides were designed
as to rationally mimic and disrupt the hGal-7 segment
between residues 13–25 and 129–135, since those residues
appear to be directly involved in the stabilization of the
dimeric structure (Fig. 1C) and consequently hindering
the interaction of R14, R20, R22, D130 and F135 with
their mirror partners. Accordingly, peptides corresponding
to these regions were synthesized, i.e. hGal-7(13–25) (H-IleArg-Pro-Gly-Thr-Val-Leu-Arg-Ile-Arg-Gly-Leu-Val-NH2)
and hGal-7(129–135) (H-Leu-Asp-Ser-Val-Arg-Ile-Pro-NH2).
To determine whether these peptides could inhibit the
formation of the hGal-7 homodimer, we incubated 0.5 μM
of recombinant hGal-7 with increasing concentrations of
hGal-7(13–25) or hGal-7(129–135) and measured the formation
of homodimers.
To measure the ability of the peptides to disrupt
the formation of hGal-7 dimers, we used mild denaturing
native gel electrophoresis, a commonly used approach
to visualize monomer-dimer equilibrium (Fig. 1A and
Supplementary Fig. S1) [31–35]. Our results showed a
consistent decrease of hGal-7 homodimers starting at a
10 μM concentration of hGal-7(129–135), with a saturation
dose of 100 μM (Fig. 2A). Similar results were obtained
with hGal-7(13–25) but this compound appeared less potent
than hGal-7(129–135) to disrupt hGal-7 homodimers and
was consequently not used in subsequent experiments
(data not shown). No such effect was observed using the
control pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide
(PACAP) peptide, which was selected based on similarity
in amino acid length and minimal toxicity on the cell line,
PACAP(28–38) (Fig. 2A), or on a recombinant human
gal-1 (hGal-1) or gal-2 (hGal-2) (Fig. 2B, 2C). hGal-1 and
gal-2 were chosen as galectin selectivity controls since
they are protype galectin that share the greatest sequence
similarity to galectin-7 (38%) [29]. Moreover, the ability
of the hGal-7(129–135) peptide to disrupt the formation of
hGal-7 homodimers was not inhibited by the presence of
lactose or LacNac (Fig. 2D, 2E). Further, the ability of
hGal-7(129–135) to bind hGal-7 in a concentration-dependent
and specific manner was further confirmed using a solid
phase binding assay. In this assay, a biotinylated version
of hGal-7(129–135) still capable of specifically inhibiting
the formation of hGal-7 homodimers (Supplementary
Fig. S2) was used to measure binding on immobilized
recombinant hGal-7 (Fig. 3). Again, binding was shown
to be specific since biotinylated hGal-7(129–135) could bind
hGal-7 and not hGal-1 or hGal-2 (Supplementary Fig. S2).
This specificity at disrupting hGal-7 dimer formation is
provided by distinct three-dimensional arrangements

RESULTS
As depicted with G protein-coupled receptors,
peptides derived from the dimeric interface were shown
to disrupt GPCR dimers by interfering with critical
interactions between amino acids located at the dimer
interface [27, 28]. We hypothesized that the ability of
hGal-7 to form homodimers is mediated by critical
residues located at the homodimer interface located in a
distant region of the CRD. Using a previously described
dimeric crystal structure of hGal-7 [29], critical residues
possibly involved in the formation of the dimer interface
were identified based on their propensity to form hydrogen
bonding, hydrophobic, or van der Waals interactions
between both protomers of the complex (Fig. 1B). In
addition, the design of our peptides was also based on the
structural analysis of the hGal-7 dimeric interface, recently
reported by Ermakova and colleagues [30]. Specifically,

hGal-7 (0.5 μM) was incubated with increasing concentrations of hGal-7(129–135) in 20 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.1). Incubation
of the recombinant B. hGal-1 and C. hGal-2 with hGal-7(129–135) was performed in the same potassium phosphate buffer. The effect of
hGal-7(129–135) on the monomeric and dimeric forms of hGal-7/hGal-1/hGal-2 was assessed by Western blotting in native conditions with
respective antibodies. The hGal-1/hGal-2 films were overexposed. PACAP28–38 was the control peptide used in order to ensure the specificity
of hGal-7(129–135). Recombinant hGal-7 (0.5 μM) was also incubated with increasing concentrations of hGal-7(129–135) in 0.1 mM D. lactose or

between otherwise very similar galectin homologues.
Indeed, while all monomeric galectins reveal identical
topologies, dimer formation in hGal-7 proceeds through
a “back-to-back” topology of the monomers while other
galectins, including hGal-1 and hGal-2, adopt a “side-byside” structural arrangement (Fig. 1B) [29]. This structural
organization provides additional means to specifically
target and disrupt galectin function.
Galectins are well known for their ability to
bind glycosylated cell surface receptors, most notably on

Jurkat T cells, on which galectin binding induces apoptosis
[36–42]. We thus tested whether hGal-7(129–135) could
modulate the binding of hGal-7 on Jurkat T cells, a cell
model that is routinely used to test the pro-apoptotic activity
of galectins [43–45]. For this purpose, recombinant hGal7 was labeled with fluorescein isothiocyante (FITC) and
its binding on the surface of Jurkat T cells was measured
by flow cytometry in absence  or presence of increasing
concentrations of hGal-7(129–135). Our results showed that
hGal-7(129–135) increased the fluorescent intensity of Jurkat

incubation with equal amounts (0.1 μM) of FITC-labeled
hGal-7, as compared to fluorescence measured in absence
of peptide (Fig. 4A). No such effect was observed in
presence of a high concentration of the control peptide
(PACAP(28–38)). The effect of hGal-7(129–135) was specific,
statistically significant (Fig. 4B), and consistent with the
increased number of monomers, which bind to surface
glycosylated receptors through their CRDs [38]. The
hGal-7(129–135) peptide also inhibited the ability of hGal7 to induce apoptosis in Jurkat T cells, as measured by
poly [ADP-ribose] polymerase 1 (PARP-1) cleavage
(Fig. 5A). This inhibitory effect was dose-dependent and
also observed using human peripheral blood monocytes
(Supplementary Fig. S3). No such effect was observed with
the control peptide. This effect on apoptosis was confirmed
by flow cytomtery using Annexin V/propidium iodide
(PI) staining (Fig. 5B and 5C). Incubation of hGal-7(129–135)
(or PACAP(28–38)) alone did not induce apoptosis in Jurkat

activity and represent attractive agents against the prototype
galectins because they target a second distant site from the
active CRD. They are also a complementary alternative to
soluble glycans or other small molecular weight allosteric
inhibitors that are currently being developed for the
targeting of prototype galectins. This peptidic inhibitor
also represents an additional means to achieve specificity
when targeting galectins. Although soluble glycans have
shown physiological responses in in vivo assays for various
pathologies where galectins are involved, there is yet little
evidence of their specificity. This may not be surprising
since galectins display high homology among their CRDs
and often show redundancy when binding to glycosylated
moieties [29, 46]. Hence, their specific targeting remains
ambiguous and challenging, and the use of peptides could
improve the current library of selective galectin inhibitors.
We attempted to synthesize other peptides covering
other potential sites at the dimeric interface of hGal-7. This
strategy was unsuccessful since these peptides were either
toxic to Jurkat T cells, showed poor solubility, or were not as
effective at disrupting the dimeric interface as hGal-7(129–135)
(data not shown). Although we did find a direct interaction
between hGal-7(129–135) and hGal-7 through a classical solidphase binding assay, further tests are required to determine
how hGal-7(129–135) binds to the critical residues located at
the interface. Interestingly, our preliminary data using an
alanine scan strategy has already shown that the substitution
of the Asp130 residue by an Ala moiety completely abrogates
the ability of the peptide to disrupt hGal-7 homodimers
(Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. S5).
It is clear, however, that hGal-7(129–135) was effective at
relatively high concentrations and future modifications
will be needed to improve its binding affinity. These alanine

DISCUSSION
In the present work, we report a new peptidic inhibitor
that specifically binds hGal-7, disrupts the formation of
homodimers, and inhibits the pro-apoptotic activity of
hGal-7 on Jurkat T cells. These results show that the dimer
interface of the prototype galectins is a viable option for
the inhibition of galectins and a potential therapeutic target
for the treatment of many diseases in which galectins are
involved. To our knowledge, there have been no published
reports of dimerization-disrupting inhibitors of galectins.
Such inhibitors provide a new avenue for blocking hGal-7

scans nevertheless suggest that binding of hGal-7(129–135)
to monomeric hGal-7 proceeds in a non-native fashion
relative to wild-type hGal-7 dimer formation. Indeed, it is
currently impossible to structurally rationalize some of the
molecular effects of the alanine scan results in the context
of wild-type hGal-7 dimer formation. For instance, while
Asp130 does not participate in the formation or stabilization
of the wild-type hGal-7 dimer interface (Fig. 1C), its
replacement to alanine clearly shows significant alteration
of the hGal-7(129–135) potency Supplementary Fig. S5. These

analyses.
Moreover, the modulation of hGal-7 binding on the
surface of Jurkat T cells and an apoptotic response were
observed in the presence of the hGal-7(129–135) peptide.
The increase in fluorescence was the manifestation of the
increased hGal-7 binding on cell surface rather than its
accumulation inside the cell, since the binding assays were
performed at 0°C and in the presence of sodium azide,
which would limit protein internalization [47, 48]. Whether
this reflects increased binding of monomeric forms of

Gal-7, however, is currently unclear and will require more
experiments. Nevertheless, the increase of hGal-7 cell
surface binding, seen in the presence of hGal-7(129–135), is
specific since the control peptide, PACAP(28–38), did not
display such effects. Interestingly, even though an increase
of cell surface hGal-7 binding was observed, a reduction in
the ability of the protein to induce apoptosis of T cells was
observed. This supports the idea that the increase in hGal7 binding on cell surface is due to the increased access
of the monomer's CRDs binding glycosylated residues on
cell surface receptors while lacking intracellular signaling,
highlighting that effective crosslinking of cell surface
receptors is critical for inducing apoptosis [25, 49]. Such
peptide may thus be a valable tool to study the ability of
Gal-7 to modulate T cells functions in vitro or in vivo.
We and others have indeed shown that Gal-7 has a strong
cytotoxic and inhibitory effects on T cell functions and
survival [38, 50], consistent with the ability of galectins
to induce to a local (and systemic ?) immunosuppression
when produced by cancer cells. Intriguingly, a slight
increase in apoptosis is observed with the control peptide,
even though the PACAP(28–38) peptide did not display any
toxicity on Jurkat T cells alone. PACAP(28–38) is a positively
charged peptide that binds cell surface phospholipids but
does not translocate within the cytoplasm [51]. Even if the
peptide alone does not induce apoptosis, the perturbation
exerted by PACAP(28–38) at the cell surface might slightly
increase hGal-7-induced necrosis.

was attached to the peptidyl resins with triethylamine

for 2 h at room temperature. The diethyl ether-precipitated

performed on a Waters PrepLC 4000 System with a Waters

2-min increments (Eluent A = H2O, 0.1% TFA, Eluent
B = 60% CH3CN/40% H2O, 0.1% TFA) was used for
each purification. Collected fractions were then analyzed
by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization – timeof-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (Voyager DE
System from Applied Biosystems) in linear mode using
the α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid matrix (Carlsbad,
CA, USA) and analytical RP-HPLC with a Phenomenex
Jupiter C18 column to ensure their homogeneity. Fractions
corresponding to the desired product with purity greater than
98% were pooled and lyophilized.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell lines and reagents

Production of recombinant hGal-7 and hGal-1

The Jurkat cell line was maintained in RPMI
1640 medium. The culture medium was supplemented
with 10% [v/v] fetal bovine serum, 2 mmol/L L-glutamine,
10  mM HEPES buffer, and 1 mM sodium pyruvate.
All cell culture products were purchased from Life
Technologies (Burlington, ON, Canada). Isolation of
peripheral mononuclear cell (PBMCs) was performed as
previously described [17].

Human Gal-7 cDNA was cloned into pET-22b(+)
using NdeI and HindIII restriction enzymes. Human
pET-Gal-1 vector was generously donated by Dr. S. Sato
(McGill University, QC, Canada). The proteins were
produced in E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells at 37°C. Isopropyl
β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) (1 mM) was added to
the bacterial culture at OD600nm = 0.6–0.7 and then incubated
for 4 h at 37°C to allow protein production. Bacterial pellets
were resuspended in lysis buffer (0.7 mg/mL lysozyme,
10  mM Tris pH 8, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM
DTT and a protease inhibitor cocktail) and then incubated
for 1 h at 37°C prior to centrifugation for 30 min at
15,000 × g (4°C). The supernatant was then filtered with
500  mL bottle top filter (22 μm) (Corning, New York,
NY, USA) and then ran through a lactose-agarose column
(Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA). The protein was eluted in
1 mL fractions with 150  mM lactose solution. Purified
fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The hGal-7 was
then concentrated and purified using Centrifugal filter units
(Amicon Ultra-15, 10K) (EMD, Millipore, Etobicoke, ON)
in 20 mM potassium phosphate at pH 7.1. All subsequent
experiments with the recombinant proteins were performed
in the same buffer solution unless mentioned otherwise.

Peptide synthesis
The hGal-7(129–135) peptide and its Ala-substituted
derivatives ([Ala130]hGal-7(129–135), [Ala131]hGal-7(129–135),
[Ala133]hGal-7(129–135) and [Ala135]hGal-7(129–135)), as well as
the control peptide PACAP28–38 (an inactive fragment
of the human Pituitary Adenylate Cyclase-Activating
Polypeptide (PACAP)), were synthesized using standard
Fmoc chemistry, as previously described [52]. Briefly, all
peptides were assembled using a semi-automatic multireactor system. The Rink-amide resin was used as the solid
support, and the amino acids of the peptide sequences
were introduced under their Fmoc-N-protected form,
i.e. 3 eq based on the original substitution of the resin
(0.7 mmol.g-1). Couplings of the protected amino acids were

FITC conjugation and hGal-7 binding assay

Western blotting

To assess hGal-7 binding onto Jurkat T cells, 5 μL of
a 1.25 mg/mL fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)/DMSO
solution was added to 300 μL of 1.7 μg/μL recombinant
hGal-7 in a 0.1 M NaHCO3 pH 9.2 solution and incubated
for 1 h at room temperature on a roller. FITC-labeled
hGal-7 was then purified using a PD-10 Sepharose column
(GE healthcare) and eluted with PBS containing 0.01%
[v/v] sodium azide. FITC-labeled hGal-7 (0.1 μM) was
then pre-incubated with hGal-7(129–135) (or related peptides)
in 20 mM potassium phosphate buffer pH 7.1 for 1 h at
4°C. Jurkat cells (5 × 105 cells per sample) were harvested
in PBS-0.01% [v/v] sodium azide and incubated for
30 min on ice with the FITC-labeled hGal-7 with and
without peptides. Cells were then washed with PBS-0.01%
[v/v] sodium azide and resuspended in 400 μL of the same
buffer and analyzed on a FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences).

For the apoptosis tests, whole-cell extracts were
homogenized and resuspended in RIPA buffer (Thermo
Fisher Scientific, Rockford, IL, USA) containing protease
inhibitors (Roche, Laval, QC, Canada). Equal amounts of
whole-cell extracts (25 μg) were separated on SDS-PAGE
and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad
Laboratories). The membranes were first blocked with
5% milk [w/v] in TBS/0.5% Tween 20 [v/v] for 1 h at
room temperature and subsequently blotted overnight in a
solution of TBS containing 3% BSA [w/v] and 0.5% Tween
20 [v/v]. The following antibodies were used: a rabbit antipoly-(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP)-1 (p25) polyclonal
antibody (1:5000; Epitomics, Burlingame, CA, USA) and
a mouse anti-β-actin (1:10000; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis,
MO, USA). Secondary antibodies consisted of horseradish
peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit (GE Healthcare,
Buckinghamshire, England) and sheep anti-mouse (GE
Healthcare) IgG. Detection was performed using the
enhanced chemiluminescence method (GE Healthcare). For
the recombinant protein tests, each peptide was dissolved
and maintained in 20 mM potassium phosphate at pH 7.1.
The β-lactose and N-Acetyl-D-lactosamine (LacNAc)
powders were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis,
MO, USA). The recombinant proteins and peptide dilutions
were pre-incubated for 1 h at 4°C prior to gel migration. The
native polyacrylamide gel was made without SDS to allow
molecular weight differentiation between the dimer and
monomer. The following antibodies were used: a goat antiGal-7 antibody (1:10000; R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN,
USA), a mouse anti-Gal-1 antibody (1:1000; Proteintech,
Chicago, IL, USA) and a rabbit anti-Gal-2 antibody (1:1000;
Proteintech, Chicago, IL, USA). Secondary antibodies
consisted of donkey anti-goat (R&D Systems) or sheep antimouse (GE Healthcare) IgG. Detection was performed as
mentioned above.

Apoptosis assays with Annexin V/PI staining
Apoptosis was measured by flow cytometry
using FITC-labeled Annexin V (Biolegend, San Diego,
CA, USA) and propidium iodide (PI). Briefly, the
corresponding dilutions of recombinant hGal-7 and hGal7(129–135) peptides were pre-incubated for 1 h at 4°C in
serum free RPMI 1640 medium. 2.5 × 105 Jurkat cells
were then harvested in the same medium and incubated
with their corresponding dilutions at 37°C for 4 h. Cells
were washed once in PBS and once in binding buffer
(0.01 M HEPES, 0.14 M NaCl, 2.5 mM CaCl2, pH 7.4).
Cells were then incubated for 15 min with Annexin V in
the dark at room temperature. A total of 400 μL of binding
buffer containing 0.25 μg/mL propidium iodide was added
to the cells before analysis by flow cytometry.

Statistical analysis
Statistical significance of the experiments was
evaluated using the unpaired Student’s t-test or the
Fisher’s exact test. Results were considered statistically
significant at P ≤ 0.05.

Fluorescent binding assay
Recombinant hGal-7 or hGal-1 (10 μg/mL)
was  coated overnight at 4°C on black, flat bottom,
96-well polystyrene microplates (Ultident, Montreal,
QC, Canada). Thereafter, the plate was blocked with
Reagent diluent (PBS-BSA 1%) for 1 h, then incubated
with unlabeled hGal-7(129–135) (cold) for 60 min and finally
incubated with biotin-labeled [Ahx0]hGal-7(129–135) for 2 h.
Lastly, Streptavidin R-phycoerythrin (1/500, Jackson
Immunoresearch, West Grove, PA, USA) was applied to
samples for 30 min. All incubations were performed at
room temperature and the washes between incubations
were done with 20 mM potassium phosphate buffer

CONCLUSIONS
We have identified a new class of galectin inhibitors
that specifically target the dimer interface of hGal-7.
Such inhibitor provides an interesting alternative to more
conventional galectin inhibitors that target the CRD
with soluble glycans. Given the critical role of hGal-7 in
cancer, studies are underway to determine whether both
types of inhibitors could be used in combination as anticancer agents.
