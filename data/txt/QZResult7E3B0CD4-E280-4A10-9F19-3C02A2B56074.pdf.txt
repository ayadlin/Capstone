ABSTRACT:
Polo-like kinase 1, a pivotal regulator of mitosis and cytokinesis, is highly
expressed in a broad spectrum of tumors and its expression correlates often with
poor prognosis, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target. p53, the guardian of
the genome, is the most important tumor suppressor. In this review, we address the
intertwined relationship of these two key molecules by fighting each other as eternal
rivals in many signaling pathways. p53 represses the promoter of Polo-like kinase 1,
whereas Polo-like kinase 1 inhibits p53 and its family members p63 and p73 in cancer
cells lacking functional p53. Plk1 inhibitors target all rapidly dividing cells irrespective
of tumor cells or non-transformed normal but proliferating cells. Upon treatment with
Plk1 inhibitors, p53 in tumor cells is activated and induces strong apoptosis, whereas
tumor cells with inactive p53 arrest in mitosis with DNA damage. Thus, inactive p53 is
not associated with a susceptible cytotoxicity of Polo-like kinase 1 inhibition and could
rather foster the induction of polyploidy/aneuploidy in surviving cells. In addition,
compared to the mono-treatment, combination of Polo-like kinase 1 inhibition with
anti-mitotic or DNA damaging agents boosts more severe mitotic defects, effectually
triggers apoptosis and strongly inhibits proliferation of cancer cells with functional
p53. In this regard, restoration of p53 in tumor cells with loss or mutation of p53
will reinforce the cytotoxicity of combined Polo-like kinase 1 therapy and provide a
proficient strategy for combating relapse and metastasis of cancer.

INTRODUCTION:

[9]. While Plk4 controls centriole duplication [10-12],
Plk5 seems to be linked with neuron biology [6].
Plk1, the most thoroughly characterized member
among the mammalian Plks, has multiple important roles
in mitosis and cytokinesis, such as centrosome maturation,
bipolar spindle formation, kinetochore-microtubule
dynamics, activation of the anaphase promoting complex,
chromosome segregation and execution of cytokinesis
[3,4,13]. In line with this multitude of proposed
functions, Plk1 localizes to centrosomes, mitotic spindles,
kinetochores, the central spindle and midbody [2,1416]. The Plk1 activity and its Polo-box binding domain
(PBD) are required to mediate its localization to mitotic
structures [17-21]. It has been recently reported that while
dynactin targets Plk1 to kinetochores [22], the cullin 3
(CUL3)-based E3 ubiquitin ligase containing the adaptor
KLHL22 ubiquitylates Lys 492 within the PBD and leads
to Plk1 dissociation from kinetochore phosphoreceptors

Polo-like kinase 1 and the tumor suppressor p53
Since the discovery of Polo kinase in Drosophila
in 1988 [1], the Polo-like kinase (Plk) family has been
attracting enormous attention, both in academia and in
pharmaceutical industry. Five members of the Plk family
have been discovered in humans and these serine/threonine
kinases have emerged as key players by performing
crucial functions in the cell cycle, DNA damage response
and neuron biology [2-6]. Plk1 is mainly expressed during
the late G2 and M phase, where it regulates various stages
of mitosis [2,7]. Plk2 is an immediate early response gene
and is expressed in early G1, where it controls the entry
into S phase [8]. Plk3 is expressed throughout the cell
cycle and involved in cellular response to DNA damage

[23]. In the absence of KLHL22, Plk1 accumulates
on kinetochores, resulting in activation of the spindle
assembly checkpoint (SAC) [23].
Plk1 strongly promotes progression of the cell
cycle and is responsible for aggressive proliferation
of tumor cells, regarded as a cellular proliferation
marker [24]. Overexpression of Plk1 enables cells to
override checkpoints, leading to genomic instability
and promoting cell transformation [7,25,26]. In support
of these interesting data, Plk1 is highly expressed in
a broad spectrum of human tumors and its expression
often correlates with poor prognosis of tumor patients,
suggesting its involvement in oncogenesis and its potential
as a therapeutic target [3,26]. Interestingly, genome-wide
RNAi screening has identified Plk1 as the only kinase
selectively required for the viability of activated Ras
cancer cells [27]. Moreover, tumor-initiating cells are
responsible for tumor maintenance and relapse. Recently,
multiple studies have reported that Plk1 is a potential
therapeutic target for eliminating tumor-initiating cells in
various tumor types [28-32], implying that inhibiting Plk1
could be useful for combating relapse and metastasis of
tumors.
Plk1 offers two functional important target domains:
a kinase domain at the N-terminus that is closely related to
several members of the superfamily of protein kinases, and
the unique specific PBD at the C-terminus. Over the years,
efforts have been made to identify Plk1 inhibitors, yielding
numerous potent compounds that competitively inhibit the
catalytic activity and regulatory function of Plk1 [7,33-35].
In concordance with this, several small-molecule inhibitors
of Plk1 are currently under clinical trials [7,36-42]. Based

on a fluorescence polarization assay, we have identified
the natural product thymoquinone (TQ) and its synthetic
derivative Poloxin as the first small molecule inhibitors
targeting the PBD of Plk1 [43,44]. Poloxin exhibits a high
specificity toward the PBD of Plk1, interferes with the
intracellular localization of Plk1, induces mitotic arrest
and chromosome congression defects [43]. It suppresses
proliferation and triggers apoptosis in cancer cell lines and
inhibits tumor growth in xenograft mouse models as well
[44].
The key tumor suppressor p53, discovered in
1979 [45,46], has become a milestone in cancer biology
[47]. p53 has been the focus since the late 1980s, when
it became evident that TP53, the gene encoding the p53
protein, was mutated or altered in various human cancers
[48,49]. As the guardian of the genome [50], p53 plays
crucial roles in DNA repair, cell cycle arrest, apoptosis,
senescence, differentiation, cell adhesion, cell mobility,
aging, autophagy, cellular metabolism and somatic
cell reprogramming of stem-cell biology [51-59]. p53
functions as a tetramer and its N-terminal region consists
of an intrinsically disordered transactivation domain and
a proline-rich region, followed by the central, folded
DNA-binding core domain for sequence-specific DNA
binding, a flexible linker, a short tetramerization domain
regulating the oligomerization, and finally the regulatory
domain at its C-terminus binding DNA nonspecifically
[60]. At homeostasis, the steady-state level of p53 is kept
low and p53 function is repressed mainly by the negative
regulators mouse double minute 2 (MDM2, human
ortholog HDM2) and MDMX (human ortholog HDMX)
[61]. p53 is activated in response to oncogenic activation,

DNA damage, telomere erosion, ribosomal stress, loss of
cell-cell or cell-matrix adhesion, hypoxia or other cellular
stress [62]. Its activity and cellular level are tightly
controlled by a multitude of regulatory proteins, involving
diverse posttranslational modifications [63,64]. Loss
of p53 function occurs in most human tumors by either
mutation of TP53 itself or by inactivation of the p53 signal
transduction pathway [52,65,66]. Therefore, awakening
the guardian of the genome by drugging the p53 pathway
could have wide applications in fighting cancer [66,67].
During our studies on Plk1 we have very often
observed that Plk1 crosses the signaling pathways of p53
and vice versa. In the present review we have focused
on the intertwined relationship between the key tumor
suppressor p53 and the key mitotic kinase Plk1. We have
summarized the function of p53 in mitosis under cellular
stress. Finally, we have dealt with the impact of p53 on
efficacy of Plk1 inhibitors in tumor cells.

G1/S boundary, increases in the S phase, and is maximally
expressed during the G2/M transition. Based on promoter
luciferase assays, three activating regions have been
identified between 35 and 93 base pairs upstream of the
transcription initiation site [69]. A repressor element,
termed the cell cycle-dependent element and the cell cycle
genes homology region (CDE/CHR), is located in the
region of the transcription start site in the Plk1 promoter
and mutations within this element diminished cell cycle
regulation of transcription [69].
The Plk1 gene is mainly suppressed by p53 and the
retinoblastoma (RB) pathway (Fig. 1). p21/waf1 (p21), the
downstream effector of p53, inhibits the Plk1 expression
partly by targeting sequences CDE and CHR in the Plk1
promoter [70]. p53 negatively regulates the expression
of the forkhead box M1 (FoxM1) [71,72], an oncogenic
transcription factor, which stimulates Plk1 expression
[73]. On the other hand, the transcriptional activation of
FoxM1 is dependent upon the phosphorylation by Plk1
[74]. In addition, the RB family members, p130, p107
and p105, play key roles in transcriptional repression of
the Plk1 gene [75,76]. The RB pathway activation results
in repression of the Plk1 promoter activity, which is
dependent on the chromatin remodeling complex SWI/
SNF [75].
Not only indirectly but also directly, p53 regulates
the Plk1 expression. Recently, it has been reported that p53
is both necessary and sufficient to mediate a transcriptional
repression of the Plk1 promoter [77]. Repression of
the Plk1 gene by p53 occurs independently of p21 and
of CDE/CHR element upon DNA damage. It is further

p53 represses the Plk1 promoter, directly and
indirectly
In an early report based on the deletion analysis of
the Plk1 promoter, several regions have been identified to
contribute to the transcriptional regulation of Plk1 [68].
The potential binding sites for transcription factors E2A,
AP1, AP2, SP1, NF-Y and NFκB could be identified in a
computer-based search [68]. A stretch of 300 base pairs
immediately 5’ of the transcription start site of the Plk1
promoter contains a CCAAT motif essential for promoter
activity [68]. The mRNA expression of Plk1 is low at the

demonstrated that p53 binds to the Plk1 promoter at two
distinct sites termed p53 response element 1 (p53RE1)
and p53RE2 based on chromatin immunoprecipitation
analysis [77]. Recruitment of p53 to p53RE2, but not to
p53RE1, is stimulated in response to DNA damage and/
or p53 activation. In addition, wild type p53 represses the
promoter expression of Plk1 when fused upstream of a
reporter gene [77]. These data strongly suggest that p53 is
a major regulator for a proper expression of the Plk1 gene
in normal cell cycle progression and upon cellular stresses
by controlling the promoter of Plk1, directly or indirectly.
Besides direct transcriptional regulation in the
promoter, p53 controls also the target gene expression
post-transcriptionally via inducing micro-RNAs
(miRNAs), such as miR-34 family [78] and miR-200
family [79]. Recent studies have shown that miR-143,
miR-100, miR-593* and miR-10b* target the Plk1
expression in cancer cells [80-85]. It will be of importance
to further decipher whether p53 is behind those miRNAs
affecting Plk1 expression.
In accordance with the findings from molecular
research, it has been reported that immunohistochemical
staining of Plk1 in primary breast tumors was significantly
associated with the presence of non-functional mutated
p53, which predicted a significantly worse survival than
those with either Plk1 expression or TP53 mutation alone
[86]. More studies are needed to explore if overexpression
of Plk1 correlates with loss of p53, non-functional p53 or
gain-of-function (GOF) mutant p53 in tumor tissues, and
if this correlation is linked to therapy resistance and poor
prognosis of tumor patients. In particular, the relationship
between the Plk1 expression and GOF mutant p53 should
be delineated, since GOF p53 mutants, supported very

often by other molecules like Pin1 [87], have widespread
genomic locations and profoundly affect gene expression
by being tethered by other transcriptional factors to
their locations and by binding with p63 to its consensus
elements [88,89].

Plk1 inhibits the function of p53, directly and
indirectly
On the other hand, Plk1 is not willing to be obedient
with the supervision of p53. Mounting evidence suggests
that Plk1 negatively regulates p53 through direct and
indirect mechanisms. Plk1 physically binds to the tumor
suppressor p53 and inhibits its transactivation activity as
well as its pro-apoptotic function in H1299 cells [90].
Immunoprecipitation analyses using a series of deletion
mutants of p53 reveal that a sequence-specific DNAbinding region of p53 is required and sufficient for the
physical interaction with Plk1. Expression of exogenous
Plk1 and p53 in lung carcinoma H1299 cells deficient in
p53 greatly decreased the p53-mediated transcription of
the p53-responsive p21, MDM2, and BAX promoters,
whereas the kinase-deficient mutant Plk1 failed to
reduce the transcriptional activity of p53 [90], suggesting
that Plk1-mediated negative regulation of p53 might
be a fundamental mechanism for the role of Plk1 in
oncogenesis. As various point mutations occur most often
in the DNA-binding region of p53 in primary cancers,
it will be important to define whether and which point
mutation in the DNA binding domain of p53 interferes
with the interaction of Plk1. It is tempting to assume
that mutated p53 is capable of escaping the inhibition of
Plk1via interrupted interaction.

Figure 3:Schematic illustration of the impact of the p53 status on the efficacy of Plk1 inhibition. Mono-therapy of Plk1

inhibition shows a moderate effect in clinical trials, suggestive of combined therapy with other agents, such as anti-mitotic or DNA
damaging drugs. Tumor cells with functional p53 respond to Plk1 combined therapy with severe mitotic defects, activation of p53 followed
by strong apoptosis in mitosis and in G1 tetraploidy. As p53 is involved in the regulation of the self-reprogramming of cancer stem cells and
Plk1 inhibitors target the tumor initiating cells, it is conceivable to suggest that this strategy could empower cancer therapy by preventing
relapse and metastasis. p53 restoration in tumor cells with loss or mutated p53 will reinforce the efficacy of Plk1 combined therapy.
Otherwise, upon Plk1 combined therapy, tumor cells without functional p53 exhibit a modest apoptosis, DNA damage in mitosis, a longer
mitosis linked to endoreduplication, which could make surviving tumor cells more malignant.

p53 inactivation by Plk1 is further underscored by
other studies [91-94]. MDM2 is a pivotal E3 ubiquitin
ligase and suppresses p53 by proteasomal degradation
and transcriptional inactivation [61]. Plk1 phosphorylates
S260 in MDM2 and stimulates MDM2-mediated turnover
of p53 [93]. Moreover, phosphorylation of S15 in p53
is required for blocking its interaction with MDM2 and
contributes to its stabilization [61]. Overexpression of
Plk1 decreases phosphorylation of p53 at S15 in UV
induced mitotic HEK293 cells via Cdc25C, a phosphatase
activated by Plk1 dependent phosphorylation [91].
Thus, this scenario results in inactivation of p53 by
Plk1. Furthermore, Plk1 phosphorylates S718 of the
topoisomerase I-binding protein (Topors) [92]. Topors has
both ubiquitin and SUMO-1 E3 ligase activity and binds
also to p53. Expression of a Plk1-unphosphorylatable
Topors mutant (S718A) leads to a dramatic accumulation
of p53 through blocking its degradation. Plk1-mediated
phosphorylation of Topors suppresses the sumoylation
of p53, whereas p53 ubiquitination is enhanced, leading
to its degradation [92]. In addition, GTSE1, a G2 and
S-phase-expressed 1 protein and a negative regulator of
p53, is required for the G2 checkpoint recovery. Plk1
phosphorylation of GTSE1 at S435 promotes its nuclear
localization and thus shuttles p53 out of the nucleus for
its degradation during the recovery [94]. These results are
consistent with a previous report that p53 is stabilized in
Plk1-depleted HeLa cells [95]. Thus, these data strongly
suggest that Plk1 inhibits its rival p53 through either
directly physical binding to block its function or indirectly
inactivating p53 by promoting its turnover, as illustrated
in Fig. 2.

N-terminal region and wild type Plk1 is able to block the
p73-mediated transcriptional activation [99]. Interestingly,
Plk1 K82M, a kinase-deficient mutant, binds still to p73
but fails to inactivate the p73-mediated transcriptional
activation, suggesting that the catalytic activity of Plk1
is not necessary for the binding but required for the
functional inhibition of p73 [99]. Plk1 inhibits p73mediated transcriptional activity is further supported
by another study [100]. In addition, Plk1 knockdown
enhances cisplatin chemosensitivity via upregulation
of p73 in p53 mutant human epidermoid squamous
carcinoma cells [101]. We have also observed that the
long-term suppression of Plk1 increases the level of the
cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor p21, which is partially
induced by elevated tumor suppressor p73 in HeLa cells
[102], in which p53 is inactivated via the E6 protein
encoded by the oncogenic human papillomavirus (HPV)
[103]. Collectively, these findings indicate that Plk1
inhibits p73 by blocking its function and increasing its
degradation in cancer cells lacking functional p53.
p63, the remaining member of the p53 family,
is unable to get away from the ruling of Plk1.
Immunoprecipitation and in vitro pull-down assay reveal
that p63 binds to the kinase domain of Plk1 through its
DNA-binding region [104]. Plk1 phosphorylates p63 at
S52 of the transactivating domain, which is associated
with decreased stability of p63 protein and suppressed p63
mediated cell death [104]. Furthermore, Plk1 knockdown
in p53-mutated liver tumor cells transactivates PUMA,
p21 and 14-3-3sigma, and induces apoptosis [104].
Therefore, Plk1 also controls p63 by phosphorylation and
regulates apoptotic cell death in liver tumor cells, in which
p53 is inactive.

Plk1 inhibits p73 and p63 in cancer cells lacking
functional p53

Plk1 inhibitors impact both tumor and normal
but proliferating cells

The battles take place not only between Plk1 and
the founding member p53 but also between Plk1 and p73/
p63, other two transcription factors of the p53 family. p73
and p63 are expressed as two predominant isoform classes
resulting from alternative promoter usage: the TAp73/
TAp63 isoforms contain an N-terminal transactivation
domain and most resemble p53, while the ΔNp73/
ΔNp63 isoforms exhibit a truncated N-terminus [96,97].
It is recently reported that the p73/p63 homeostasis is
controlled by a microRNA-dependent circuit [96].
p73 has been implicated in cell cycle regulation,
apoptosis and developmental processes [98]. In
cisplatin mediated apoptosis in COS7 cells, in which the
endogenous p53 is inactivated by SV40 large T antigen,
p73 is accumulated in association with a significant
down-regulation of Plk1 [99]. Reciprocally, Plk1 reduces
the stability of the endogenous p73 and depletion of Plk1
stabilizes p73. p73 is phosphorylated at T27 by Plk1 in
kinase assay in vitro [99]. Further analyses demonstrate
that p73 binds to the kinase domain of Plk1 through its
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Plk1 has been widely established as one of the most
promising targets for molecular intervention. Multiple
small molecule inhibitors targeting the ATP-binding
pocket of the kinase domain and its inactive conformation
have been developed [7,33-35]. Among them, BI 2536
and BI 6727 are the most intensively investigated Plk1
inhibitors [105-107]. The results from cancer cell lines
and from mouse xenograft models suggest their potent
anti-cancer activity [105,107]. In parallel to the kinase
domain, the PBD, the regulatory domain of Plk1, has been
suggested as a more ideal target due to its unique nature
which facilitates the development of specific agents [17].
Indeed, small molecules or peptides targeting the PBD
domain of Plk1 have been developed and investigated
[43,44,108,109]. The data from Plk1 inhibitors, targeting
either the kinase domain or the PBD, are inspiring, based
on cell culture systems or xenograft mouse models.
However, the clinical results are rather less encouraging
by showing limited anti-cancer activity [38,40,110,111].

To identify the molecules and signaling pathways, which
are responsible for the cytotoxicity of Plk1 inhibitors,
is fundamental for selecting suitable tumor patients for
treatment.
It has been widely proposed that Plk1 depletion/
inhibition preferentially kills cancer cells compared
with normal cells [112-115]. This leads to the hypothesis
that Plk1 inhibition is specific and selective by targeting
only cancer cells but not normal cells. However, during
characterization of the PBD inhibitor Poloxin, we clearly
observed that Poloxin inhibited proliferation of a panel
of tumor cells as well as several primary/normal nontransformed but proliferating cells, with a comparable
efficiency [44]. Proliferation of exponentially normal
growing cells, including retinal primary epithelial cells
hTERT-RPE1, human umbilical vein endothelial cells
(HUVEC), mammary epithelial MTSV-1 cells and
fibroblasts, was suppressed upon Poloxin treatment
with comparable EC50 values, suggestive of a similar
sensitivity of normal cycling cells to Plk1 inhibition.
Our observation is supported by the data from other
studies of Plk1 inhibitors, such as BI 2536 and the PBD
inhibitor purpurogallin (PPG), impacting both cancer
cells as well as normal cells with a comparable sensitivity
[107,109,116]. Recently, it has been shown that depletion
of Plk1 suppresses the viability of MCF10A, a nontransformed mammary epithelial cell line, even more
strongly than that of cancer cell line MDA-MB-468 in
monolayer cell culture system [117]. Under 3D culture
condition, however, MCF10A cells recapitulate epithelial
morphogenesis by forming acinar structures and then
stop to grow, whereas cancer MDA-MB-468 cells exhibit
disorganized structures and continue to proliferate. BI
2536, added to these structures once formed, was effective
on MDA-MB-468, and had no effect on MCF10A cells
[117]. This is ascribed to the fact that MCF10A cells do
not proliferate once the acinar structure is formed. Thus,
the sensitivity to Plk1 inhibitors possibly depends on the
doubling time of individual cell lines in a monolayer cell
culture system and in 3D culture model as well. Given the
essential role of Plk1 during mitosis, it is conceivable to
propose that Plk1 inhibitors target all rapidly dividing cells
irrespective of tumor or normal cells, which is consistent
with observed adverse effects of Plk1 inhibitors in clinical
trials [38,111,118].

Plk1 inhibitors.
p53 is localized at centrosomes, mitotic spindles,
the centromeres, the midzone/cleavage furrow in mitosis
[121-123] and is activated in response to various mitotic
stresses such as aberrant spindle formation, abnormal
centrosome separation and chromosome damage or
missegregation [124-126], suggestive of p53 role in
mitosis. p53 knockdown leads to high percentages
of cells with abnormal amplification of centrosomes
[10,127] and p53 is an important negative regulator
of the mitotic kinase Aurora A [128]. p53 localization
at the centrosomes in mitosis is ataxia-telangiectasia
mutated (ATM)-dependent and monitors mitotic
spindle integrity in mitosis [122,129,130], leading to
the proposal that ATM and p53 might contribute to the
“centrosomal checkpoint”, a network that integrates cell
cycle arrest and repair signals [131,132]. p53 is involved
in facilitating chromosome segregation to ensure the
maintenance of diploid cells [133] and is required for
cell cycle arrest after erroneous tetraploid mitosis [134].
Phosphorylation of serine 10 in histone H3 by Aurora B
kinase is critical for maintaining normal ploidy, which is
coupled with histone deacetylases I/II activity at lysine K9
[135]. Acetylation of K9 and phosphorylation of S10 are
interestingly associated in a p53-dependent manner [136].
In addition, p53 is required to enable cells to recover
from a nocodazole-induced prometaphase arrest and to
coordinate mitotic events [135,136]. The data indicate that
p53 is involved in remodeling and reorganizing chromatin
structure in mitosis upon stress. Moreover, the spindle
assembly checkpoint (SAC) is essential for proper sister
chromatid segregation in mitosis. BubR1, an important
kinase of the SAC, interacts with and phosphorylates p53
in mitotic cells and regulates protein stability of p53 in
mitosis [137]. Mps1, another spindle checkpoint kinase,
phosphorylates p53 at T18, which stabilizes and activates
p53 in mitosis [138]. This phosphorylation disrupts the
interaction with MDM2 and abrogates MDM2-mediated
p53 ubiquitination [138]. Mps1 and BubR1 mediated p53
phosphorylation are required for p53 activation to properly
induce cell death in a p53-dependent manner in response
to mitotic spindle damage [137,138]. Inhibition of Mps1
or BubR1 appears to be disabling a p53-mediated cell
death signaling pathway, contributing to accumulation of
polyploidy/aneuploidy cells in response to mitotic spindle
damage or oncogene-induced DNA damage [137,139].
These data indicate that activation of p53 is essential for
protecting cells from genome instability caused by various
mitotic failures.

p53 is pivotal for faithful mitotic progression
Furthermore, it has been reported that Plk1
depletion/inhibition preferentially kills p53 defective
cancer cells compared with p53 wild type cancer cells
[119,120]. This association of non-functional p53
with sensitivity of Plk1 inhibition leads to the second
assumption that inactive p53 facilitates the cytotoxicity of
Plk1 inhibition and tumor patients with p53 deficiency/
mutation may preferentially benefit from treatment with

Inactive p53 is not a predictor for the efficacy of
Plk1 inhibitors

a key determinant for the cytotoxic response to Plk1

inhibition in cancer cells. To address this issue, we have
examined the cytotoxicity of Plk1 inhibitors/depletion
in various cancer cell lines with or without functional
p53 [126]. We observed that cancer cells without p53
displayed no increased cytotoxicity upon treatment with
different Plk1 inhibitors or siRNA against Plk1. In fact,
cancer cells with wild type p53 showed more apoptosis
upon Plk1 inhibition, compared to cancer cells without
p53 [126]. Our observation is in line with the study by
Sur and colleagues that cancer cell lines with or without
p53 displayed only minor difference in the sensitivity of
the Plk1 inhibitor BI 2536 [140], arguing against a direct
role of defective p53 in the response to Plk1 inhibition.
Moreover, we examined whether mitotic stress impacted
the efficacy of Plk1 inhibitors in cancer cells with or
without p53. In the presence of mitotic stress induced
by different agents, HCT116 p53+/+ cells displayed a
strong apoptosis after treatment with Plk1 inhibitors with
increased pro-apoptotic protein Bax, whereas HCT116
p53-/- cells arrested in mitosis with activation of the
spindle checkpoint and DNA damage, followed by a mild
apoptosis with enhanced anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2
and Mcl-1 [141]. Moreover, the surviving HCT116 p53/- cells showed a strong capability of colony formation.
Thus, under severe mitotic stress induced by combined
therapy, HCT116 p53+/+ cells conduct apoptosis in
mitosis or exit mitosis into the G1 tetraploidy followed
by p53-dependent apoptosis, whereas HCT116 p53-/cells arrest in mitosis, possibly to initiate another round
of DNA replication as suggested [142,143]. In this
regard, Plk1 inhibition in cancer cells with inactive p53
could lead to an accumulation of polyploidy/aneuploidy,
due to the lack of p53-mediated cell death signaling
pathway. Taken together, we suggest that loss of p53 is
not directly associated with the sensitive cytotoxicity of
Plk1 inhibition. Further investigations are required to
study whether the long-term outcomes of losing p53, such
as compromised or defective DNA damage checkpoint,
abnormal metabolism and low differential grade, which
possibly make the survival of tumor cells more dependent
on Plk1 function, are responsible for the cytotoxicity of
Plk1 inhibition.

much desired to develop a new generation of anti-mitotic
drugs which target key proteins with specific functions
in mitosis, such as Plk1 [7,144] or mitotic centromereassociated kinesin [146]. Several clinical trials of the
Plk1 inhibitor BI 2536 have been performed in different
tumor types [38,39,110,118] and the mono-therapy of
Plk1 inhibitors has shown modest efficacy [38,39,111],
suggestive of combined strategy. Interestingly, retinoids
enhance the effectiveness of Plk1 inhibitor GSK461364
[147]. In xenograft mouse models, administration of BI
2536 combined with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide
leads to a faster complete response compared with
chemotherapy alone and prevents relapse in the poor
prognosis-associated triple-negative breast cancer [117].
Plk1 inhibition suppresses proliferation and enhances
radiation sensitivity in medulloblastoma cell lines [30].
These data are in consistence with our data that the
combination of Plk1 inhibition with anti-mitotic or DNA
damaging agents triggers more apoptosis and inhibits
more strongly proliferation of cancer cells compared to
the mono-treatment [102,141,148,149]. In particular,
both Plk1 inhibitors and microtubule-inhibitory agents
prolong mitotic arrest, promoting p53 stabilization, Bax
expression, caspase activation and apoptosis induction
[126,150-152]. In fact, the first clinical trial of Plk1
inhibitor BI 2536 combined with DNA damage agent
pemetrexed demonstrates an encouraging antitumor
activity in relapsed non-small-cell lung cancer [153]. The
combination will synergistically generate cytotoxicity and
reduce unwished side-effects of both Plk1 inhibitor and
anti-mitotic or DNA damage agent by reducing the dosage
of each drug.
The frequent inactivation of p53 in tumors fosters
the attractive notion that its functional restoration would
constitute an effective tumor-specific therapy. Strategies
aimed at restoring wild type p53 function in tumors
with p53 loss, mutation or inhibition have been actively
pursued and some have already reached clinical trials [67].
The therapeutic impact of those strategies in human cancer
has been recently modeled in mice where a clear, even
if limited, therapeutic benefit of p53-targeted therapies is
established. Thus, restoration of p53 is a powerful strategy
for molecular cancer therapy. In tumor cells with wild type
p53 or wild type but inactive p53, such as HeLa cells, Plk1
inhibition induces mitotic cellular stress and activates p53
leading further to a strong induction of apoptosis [126].
In tumor cells with loss or mutation of p53, restoration of
p53 will empower the cytotoxicity of Plk1 inhibitors by
strongly inducing apoptosis. Furthermore, it is conceivable
to suggest that restoration of p53 and inhibition of Plk1
will synergistically hinder relapse and metastasis of
cancer, as p53 controls stem cell reprogramming and
Plk1 inhibition eliminates tumor-initiating cells [2831]. Finally, it has been reported that BI 2536 generates
aneuploidy in primary cardiac fibroblasts [116]. Thus,
reactivation of functional p53 will be able to prevent the

Combination of inhibiting Plk1 and restoring p53
as cancer therapy
Whereas inhibiting the initial phases of the cell
cycle is likely to generate viable quiescent cells, targeting
mitosis offers possibility for killing cancer cells [144].
Mitosis is the most vulnerable phase of the cell cycle,
during which it is susceptible to induce cell death with
various insults. Microtubule poisons have been proven to
be efficacy in clinic against a broad range of malignancies,
yet they affect both dividing and non-dividing cells
inducing unwished side-effects [145]. It is therefore

genome instability caused by Plk1 inhibitors in surviving
tumor or normal but proliferating cells. Collectively,
reinstallation of functional p53 in tumor cells with loss or
mutation p53 will brighten the way for a high efficiency
of Plk1 inhibition, combined with anti-mitotic or DNA
damage agents. This strategy will fight cancer with a more
powerful efficacy by targeting not only proliferation but
also relapse and metastasis of tumor cells. Since normal
cells have wild type p53, more investigations are needed
to identify predictive biomarkers for each combination
to maximize efficacy and minimize side-effects in the
context of administration schedules, such as succession
and dosage, in individual tumors based on the molecular
working mechanisms. Hopefully, we will reach the goal
of cancer therapy that “the wolves are sated, and the sheep
are intact” [154,155].

SUMMARY

functional evolution of polo-like kinases. Cell Cycle 2011,
10: 2255-2262.

Plk1 and p53 intertwine and suppress each other in
many signaling pathways. In the context of the association
between the p53 status and Plk1 inhibition, we have
addressed two issues: first, targeting Plk1 impacts actually
all rapidly dividing cells irrespective of tumor cells or
normal cells, which is in line with the crucial role of Plk1
in mitosis; second, tumor cells with functional p53 exhibit
a stronger apoptosis than tumor cells with inactive p53. In
addition, compared to the mono-therapy, combination of
Plk1 inhibition with anti-mitotic or DNA damage agents
induces more severe mitotic defects followed by apoptosis,
and inhibits more strongly proliferation of cancer cells
with functional p53. In this regard, restoration of p53 in
tumor cells with loss or mutation of p53 will promote the
cytotoxicity of combined Plk1 therapy, prevent genome
instability induced by Plk1 inhibitors, and provide an
effective strategy for combating relapse and metastasis
of cancer (Fig. 3). A better understanding is required to
maximize efficacy and minimize side-effects of combined
Plk1 therapy in terms of administration schedules, such as
succession and dosage, in each individual tumor.
