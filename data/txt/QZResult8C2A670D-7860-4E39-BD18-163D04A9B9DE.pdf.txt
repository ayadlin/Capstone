BACKGROUND. Patients with cancer who have thrombocytopenia may experience
acute coronary syndromes (ACS), and the use of aspirin (ASA) poses an increased
risk of bleeding. The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that the
benefit of ASA therapy in the treatment of ACS would extend to cancer patients
with thrombocytopenia and outweigh the risks of severe bleeding.

METHODS. The records of all cancer patients diagnosed with an ACS in 2001 and
referred for cardiology consultation were reviewed. Patients were divided into 2
groups on the basis of platelet count, >100 cells k/mL and 100 cells k/mL. Data
were collected on the use of ASA therapy, bleeding complications, and survival
rates. The authors assessed group differences by using the Wilcoxon rank sum
test or 2-tailed Fisher exact test, as appropriate. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were used to assess factors potentially associated with

RESULTS. In cancer patients with ACS and thrombocytopenia, those who did not
receive ASA had a 7-day survival rate of 6% compared with 90% in those who did
with a platelet count (>100 cells k/mL) who received ASA had a 7-day survival

CONCLUSIONS. Therapy with ASA was associated with a significantly improved
7-day survival after ACS in cancer patients, with or without thrombocytopenia,
and not associated with more severe bleeding. Cancer 2007;109:621–7.

T

he clinical presentation of an acute coronary syndrome (ACS),
defined as unstable angina or acute myocardial infarction, in cancer patients may be similar to that observed in the general population;
however, significant controversies exist about how these patients are
treated, especially when thrombocytopenia is also present. Cancer
survivors are at increased risk of developing coronary artery disease
partly as a result of treatment but also due to prolonged survival.1,2
Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is known to occur when there is a
combination of atherosclerotic plaques and superimposed thrombosis, and it may be precipitated by inflammation, infection, or rupture
of vulnerable plaques.3 Cancer induces a prothrombotic state by various mechanisms, including platelet activation and aggregation, as
well as an increase in procoagulant factors.4 Current guidelines of the
American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology recommend aspirin (ASA) therapy in all cases of ACS.3 An exception and
relative contraindication to such therapy may be thrombocytopenia.
The guidelines for ACS were developed for patients with a normal platelet count, and in all major clinical trials of antithrombotic therapy

and ACS, patients with cancer have generally been
excluded. Therefore, no specific clinical guidelines
exist for treating ACS in patients with cancer, with or
without thrombocytopenia.
One clinical trial suggested that patients with ACS
and thrombocytopenia have an increased incidence of
bleeding and ischemic events compared with patients
with ACS and a normal platelet count.4 Nevertheless,
despite increased incidence of bleeding complications
with antiplatelet therapy in these trials, the use of aspirin when compared with placebo consistently resulted
in better overall clinical outcomes. It is particularly
noteworthy that thrombocytopenia in these studies
was usually caused by anticoagulation therapy and
was not related to chemotherapy or bone marrow suppression. Yet another complicating factor in cancer
treatment is the issue of hypercoagulability. Clinical
thrombosis is estimated to occur in up to 15% of
patients,6 and this hypercoagulable state is thought to
be caused by substances secreted by tumor cells that
may activate different aspects of the coagulation pathway.5 Iatrogenic devices and indwelling intravenous
catheters, as well as the administration of heparin
flushes, can also predispose patients to thrombosis
and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. Approximately 10% of patients with cancer have thrombocytopenia, defined as a platelet count of 100 cells k/mL.6
This can be caused by bone marrow infiltration, chemotherapy side effects, platelet sequestration in the
spleen, or increased peripheral destruction that occurs
in cases of severe sepsis, disseminated intravascular
coagulation, and hemolytic uremic syndrome with
thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. Thrombocytopenia and a propensity for increased thrombus
formation coexist in several clinical syndromes,
including hemolytic uremic syndrome with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura,7 antiphospholipid
antibody syndrome,8 pregnancy-induced thrombocytopenia, and May-Hegglin anomaly.9 The mechanisms
underlying thrombocytopenia and increased thrombus formation are not known; although, the hypercoagulable state of affected patients could be secondary
to compensatory increases in platelet size and activation when patient platelet counts decrease. Several
case reports have indicated the effectiveness of ASA in
such patients.6–8 In some cases, treatment with ASA
actually resulted in an increase in platelet count.9
Given these considerations, we hypothesized that
the benefit of therapy with ASA for ACS would extend
to patients with cancer who have thrombocytopenia
secondary to chemotherapy or bone marrow suppression and that any risk of bleeding would be more than
acceptable by clinical benefit. Conversely, we hypothesized that withholding ASA in cancer patients with

ACS would be harmful. Thus, to investigate these
hypotheses, we conducted a retrospective analysis of
patients with cancer and ACS with and without thrombocytopenia, who were admitted to the University of
Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center over a 1-year period. We evaluated the effect of treatment with ASA on
survival and the incidence of bleeding.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
Medical records of all patients with a diagnosis of ACS
who were referred and treated at M. D. Anderson Cancer
Center in the year 2001 were reviewed by a single observer. The diagnosis of ACS in these patients was determined on the basis of the presence of any 2 criteria as
follows: (1 chest pain, (2 characteristic electrocardiogram (ECG) changes of ACS, and (3 a characteristic rise
in cardiac enzymes. Elevated cardiac enzyme level
was defined as creatine kinase levels more than twice
the normal limit, creatine kinase isoenzyme levels
>10% above the normal limit, and troponin I levels
>1.4 ng/mL. Patients with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia were excluded from study. The current study
was approved by the M. D. Anderson Cancer Center
Institutional Review Board. Patients were divided into
2 groups according to their platelet count at the time of
ACS diagnosis as follows: those with a normal platelet
count (>100 cell k/mL) and those with thrombocytopenia (platelet count 100 cells k/mL). We assessed the
following characteristics in each patient, the underlying
cancer diagnosis, which was classified as solid tumor or
hematologic; risk factors for CAD, including age, sex,
previous history of CAD, smoking history, hypertension,
family history, and presence of diabetes mellitus; use of
ASA and b-blockers; and the 7-day survival rate in both
groups according to whether ASA therapy was instituted. In addition, we analyzed the mean hemoglobin
level at the onset of ACS, the incidence of bleeding, and
the need for blood and platelet transfusions in each
group. For the purpose of the current study, major
bleeding complications in relation to ASA were defined
as a decrease in hemoglobin level of >2 gm/dL from
baseline, any overt genitourinary or gastrointestinal
bleeding, any intracranial bleeding, any need for blood
transfusion, and internal bleeding in any organ. In view
of a potential for bleeding complications, these patients
were followed meticulously for any signs of bleeding.
Statistical Analyses
We assessed platelet level group differences using
the Fisher exact test and Wilcoxon rank sums test as
appropriate. Univariate and multivariate logistic
regression models were used to examine factors

potentially associated with 7-day survival. Independent
variables included demographic variables (age, sex), risk
factors for developing coronary artery disease (history
of coronary artery disease, diabetes, hypertension,
smoking), severity of myocardial infarction (presence of
Q-waves, ST segment elevation, troponin level, creatine
kinase–MB fraction [CK–MB], initial ejection fraction),
treatment factors (use of aspirin, use of b-blockers, hemoglobin level, platelet count, platelet transfusion
1 week before or 1 week after myocardial infarction,
packed red blood cell transfusion, bleeding), and type of
tumor. Factors associated with 7-day survival at P < .10
were considered in multivariate modeling. The final
model was derived by using a forward selection procedure. P-values of < .05 were considered statistically significant. Analyses were performed with SAS for
Windows (release 9.1; SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC).

RESULTS
A total of 70 patients were identified with ACS at M. D.
Anderson in 2001; of these patients, 43 (61%) had normal platelet counts (>100 cells k/mL), and 27 (39%)
were thombocytopenic (platelet count 100 cells k/mL).
The baseline risk factors and demographics were similar
in both groups (Table 1), except those with normal platelets were more likely to have a solid tumor (P ¼ .0001).
In the normal platelet group, the median platelet count
was 225,000 (range, 121,000 to 498,000). In the thrombocytopenic group, the median platelet count was 32,000
(range, 4,000 to 100,000) (Table 2). Additionally, patients
with normal platelet counts had a significantly higher

low platelets (median, 8.80) (P < .0002) and a lower initial heart rate (92 vs 112, P ¼ .02) upon presentation.
There was no significant difference in systolic blood
pressure upon presentation between the groups. In
addition, there was nonsignificant trend toward lower
left ventricular ejection fraction (P ¼ .0529) in the normal platelet group (Table 2).
The management of ACS differed by patient group.
Fewer patients in the thrombocytopenia group
received treatment with ASA and b-blockers than did
patients in the normal platelet count group. Thirtyseven percent (n ¼ 10) of patients with thrombocytopenia received ASA, compared with 74% (n ¼ 32) of
patients with a normal platelet count (P ¼ .0027), Figure 1. Similarly, 41% (n ¼ 11) of patients with thrombocytopenia received b-blockers compared with 74%
(n ¼ 32) of patients with a normal platelet count
(P ¼ .0062), Figure 2.
The 7-day survival rate was significantly higher in
the normal platelet count group (77%) than in the
thrombocytopenia group (37%), P ¼ .0012. In both
groups, the survival of patients who received ASA was
significantly higher than that in patients who did not
receive ASA. In the thrombocytopenia group, the overall 7-day survival in patients who received ASA was
90% compared with 6% in those who did not receive
ASA (P < .0001). Likewise, in the group with a normal
platelet count, the overall survival in patients who
received ASA was 88% compared with 45% in those

patients who did not receive ASA (P ¼ .0096) (Figure 1).
There were parallel findings for those patients in either
group who were treated with b-blockers. In those with a
normal platelet count, 29 to 32 (91%) patients survived
>7 days when treated with b-blockers, whereas only 4
of 11 (36%) survived when not treated, P ¼ .001 (Figure
2). In the thrombocytopenic group, 8 of 11 (73%)
patients survived >7 days when treated with b-blockers
whereas only 2 of 16 (13%) survived when they were not
treated (P <.001) (Figure 2).
In univariate logistic regression analysis, higher risk
of death was associated with no use of ASA (odds ratio
[OR] ¼ 27.13; 95% confidence interval [CI expressed as
upper limit, lower limit]: 7.40, 99.44; P < .0001), no use
of b-blockers (OR ¼ 21.58; 95% CI: 6.17, 75.48; P <
.0001), hematologic malignancy (OR ¼ 3.63; 95% CI:
1.13, 11.61), lower platelet count (OR ¼ 0.994; 95% CI:
0.990, 0.999; P ¼ .0086), receipt of platelets 1 week
before myocardial infarction (OR ¼ 12.06; 95% CI: 2.39,
60.93; P ¼ .0026), lower hemoglobin level (OR ¼ 0.733;
95% CI: 0.56, 0.95; P ¼ .0197), and a strong trend in
those with ST segment elevation (OR ¼ 3.43: 95% CI:
1.10,10.70; P ¼ .054). These variables, along with other
variables associated with 7-day survival at P < .10
(receipt of blood transfusion during week after myocardial infarction and receipt of platelets during week after
myocardial infarction), were considered for multivariate
analysis by using a forward selection procedure. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that no ASA
use (OR ¼ 18.44; 95% CI: 2.87, 118.60; P ¼ .0021), no bblocker use (OR ¼ 31.65; 95% CI: 2.80, 357.45;
P ¼ .0052), ST segment elevation (OR ¼ 17.24; 95%
CI: 1.84, 161.67; P ¼ .0127), and receipt of blood transfusion during the week after myocardial infarction

(OR ¼ 12.06; 95% CI: 1.03, 141.14; P ¼ .0473) were significant risk factors for death while controlling for platelet level (Table 3).
No incidences of acute major gastrointestinal
bleeding, intracranial hemorrhage, or fatal bleed
occurred. Minor bleeding occurred in 17% (n ¼ 12) of
the patients and was not significantly associated with
ASA use (P ¼ .80). Bleeding occurred more frequently
among patients who had thrombocytopenia (P ¼ .0073),
but the incidence of minor bleeding among patients
with thrombocytopenia did not differ significantly by
ASA use (P ¼ .22) (Figure 3). In patients with thrombocytopenia who received ASA, there were 5 cases of
minor bleeding (hematoma at the placement site of
central line (n ¼ 2), hematuria and occult blood in the
stool (n ¼ 1), or ecchymosis (n ¼ 2). In patients with
thrombocytopenia who did not receive ASA, minor
bleeding occurred in 4 patients (epistaxis (n ¼ 1), hematoma at the placement site of a central line (n ¼ 1),
melena and ecchymosis (n ¼ 1), and melena alone
(n ¼ 1). In the thrombocytopenia group, a total of
3 patients who received ASA underwent transfusion of
packed red blood cells for anemia. Twelve of the
patients in the thrombocytopenia group received a platelet transfusion during the week before their index ACS
event. None of the patients with a normal platelet count
at admission received a platelet transfusion in the weeks
before or after their index ACS event.

DISCUSSION
Our data suggest that among patients with cancer who
develop an ACS, the presence of thrombocytopenia is

associated with a worse outcome. However, ASA therapy in these patients may influence outcome and is
associated with improved 7-day survival without a significant increase in bleeding complications. To our
knowledge, the current report is the first to describe
the risk-benefit profile of ASA therapy in this high-risk
patient population. These results apply to those
patients with elevated troponins chest pain and
dynamic electrocardiographic changes, a population
considered to be at increase risk for serious complications including death.
The reason for this ‘‘platelet paradox’’ of coronary
thrombosis in thrombocytopenic patients is unclear.
Various factors including underlying coronary disease,
hypercoagulability, or, perhaps, adverse effects resulting from cancer therapy that disturb the coagulation
cascade may predispose these patients to thrombotic

complications. Platelet activation in cancer is mediated by a variety of mechanisms, ranging from increased expression of platelet adhesion molecules to
direct platelet activation by contact with molecules on
the surface of the tumor cell membrane.10 Compared
with healthy controls, patients with cancer have higher
levels of fibrinogen, von Willebrand factor, and soluble
P-selectin (a marker of increased platelet activation).11
When compared with healthy women, patients with
breast carcinoma have increased platelet adhesion to
fibrinogen.12 Furthermore, platelets from women with
metastasis have increased adhesion compared with
those women who have no metastasis.12 Another prothrombotic mechanism in thrombocytopenia includes
increased release of reticulated platelets,13 which are
likely to be more active than mature platelets, and it is
speculated that this release may precipitate thrombo-

sis of a coronary vessel under conditions associated
with a plaque rupture.
In the current study, patients with thrombocytopenia had a lower 7-day survival rate than did patients
in the normal platelet count group, despite their similar clinical risk factors, cardiac enzyme elevation, and
overall left ventricular ejection fraction. These data
suggest that the lower survival rate in patients with
thrombocytopenia cannot be explained only by more
extensive myocardial necrosis. The thrombocytopenia
group did have a lower hemoglobin level and had
required more platelet transfusions before the index
event (Tables 1, 2, and 3); thus, the hematologic disturbance, including activation of platelets, may be
higher in this group, and their ability to respond further may be diminished compared with the normal
platelet group.
Coronary event intervention by use of aspirin, clopidogrel, and heparin has been occasionally reported
as a treatment for patients with thrombocytopenia.14
Despite thrombocytopenia and treatment with both
aspirin and clopidogrel, thrombotic stent occlusion
has been reported,14 thus suggesting that patients with
malignancy, although thrombocytopenic, are predisposed to thrombotic vascular complications. The fear
of bleeding complications might have resulted in a
lower administration of ASA to thrombocytopenic
patients. Interestingly, the thrombocytopenic patients,
despite having adequate blood pressure and heart
rate, were also less likely to receive b-blockers.
Although our data do not allow us to explain this practice pattern, it may be that physician desire to avoid
side effects might have contributed to the reported
low administration rate of both ASA and b-blockers.

Such perceptions might simply have been more prevalent in the management of cancer patients with ACS,
and these perceptions may demonstrate general ineffectiveness in translating results from important cardiovascular clinical trials into everyday clinical practice.
Our data does not provide any insight into the importance of platelet function in ACS and thrombocytopenia. This information will be difficult to obtain,
because none of the currently available tests of platelet
function can reliably assess it in the setting of a platelet count <50 cells k/mL. However, thromboelastography may be able to assess platelet function under
these circumstances.14
This study has all the limitations intrinsic to a retrospective study and a small sample size. The number
of variables that could be included in the multivariate
analysis limited the calculation of precise risk estimates. However, all data were collected meticulously,
and the treatment practice pattern reflected the general management of ACS in a cancer population.
Ideally, a large randomized study of ACS in cancer
patients should be performed, but fear of bleeding
complications probably precludes such a study. Previous data from the National Registry of Myocardial Infarction suggest that ASA is underused in patients with
ACS.15
On the basis of this study, clinicians should consider using ASA in cancer patients with ACS and
thrombocytopenia. However, in every case, the risk
should be weighed against the benefit, because, despite the low incidence of bleeding complication in
our study, the potential for bleeding in patients with
thrombocytopenia is high.
