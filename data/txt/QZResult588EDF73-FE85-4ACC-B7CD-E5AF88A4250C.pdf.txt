Abstract
A comprehensive description of genomic alterations in lung squamous cell carcinoma (lung SCC) has
recently been reported, enabling the identiﬁcation of genomic events that contribute to the oncogenesis of
this disease. In lung SCC, one of the most frequently altered receptor tyrosine kinase families is the ﬁbroblast
growth factor receptor (FGFR) family, with ampliﬁcation or mutation observed in all four family members.
Here, we describe the oncogenic nature of mutations observed in FGFR2 and FGFR3, each of which are
observed in 3% of samples, for a mutation rate of 6% across both genes. Using cell culture and xenograft
models, we show that several of these mutations drive cellular transformation. Transformation can be
reversed by small-molecule FGFR inhibitors currently being developed for clinical use. We also show that
mutations in the extracellular domains of FGFR2 lead to constitutive FGFR dimerization. In addition, we
report a patient with an FGFR2-mutated oral SCC who responded to the multitargeted tyrosine kinase
inhibitor pazopanib. These ﬁndings provide new insights into driving oncogenic events in a subset of lung
squamous cancers, and recommend future clinical studies with FGFR inhibitors in patients with lung and
head and neck SCC. Cancer Res; 73(16); 5195–205. 2013 AACR.

Introduction
Two goals of comprehensive next-generation sequencing of
cancers are to discover novel, targetable somatic alterations,
and to identify new targets for which therapies already exist.
Genome-scale analyses of tumors representing many cancer
types have recently been completed (1–6), enabling discoveries
consistent with both goals.
Historically, targetable oncogenic alterations in cancer
were discovered on an individual gene basis. This was the
case for cancer-causing alterations observed in several tyrosine kinases, including EGFR and ALK in lung adenocarcinoma (7–9), FGFR2 in endometrial carcinoma (10, 11), and

FGFR3 in urothelial carcinoma (12). These studies and others
have led to demonstrations of the successful application of
targeted therapeutic agents and their superiority to conventional chemotherapy (13, 14).
Lung squamous cell carcinoma (lung SCC) is a prevalent and
deadly disease for which no targeted therapies are approved.
Recent data reported by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)
lung SCC project (4) showed that the ﬁbroblast growth factor
receptor (FGFR) tyrosine kinases are one of the most frequently altered kinase families in this disease. Ampliﬁcation of
FGFR1 was observed, in agreement with prior reports (15,
16). Furthermore, mutations in FGFR2 and FGFR3 were
reported. Although the frequency of these mutations did not
reach statistical signiﬁcance at the cohort size examined by
TCGA, several features including recurrence, prior observation
in other cancer types and congenital syndromes, and lack of
other dominant oncogenic alterations in tumors with FGFR
mutations, suggested they might be driving, targetable events
in a subset of patients presenting with this disease.
Germline mutations in the FGFR tyrosine kinase family were
ﬁrst described in craniofacial and skeletal syndromes (17).
Somatic point mutations identical to those germline events
have also been observed in malignancies (18). The FGFR family
is made up of four active members, each containing an
extracellular domain (ECD) and a cytoplasmic kinase domain.
Activation is stimulated by binding FGF and heparan sulfate
proteoglycan (HSPG) in the ECD, and subsequent dimerization
of two receptor–ligand complexes, leading to transphosphorylation of the kinase domains. This leads to phosphorylation of

binding partner FRS2 and downstream activation of Ras/
MAPK and PI3K/AKT pathways (19).
The FGF family is made up of more than 20 members, all of
which retain speciﬁcities for both different FGFR family members and different isoforms of each receptor (20). In addition,
tissue types vary in which receptors, isoforms, and ligands are
expressed, adding further levels of complexity to the system.
Dysregulation can lead to oncogenesis, as has been shown with
altered expression of receptors (15, 16, 21), altered isoform
expression (22, 23), and altered ligand speciﬁcity (24) driven by
somatic genomic events.
Aberrant FGFR signaling has been implicated in the development of several cancer types. In addition to lung SCC,
FGFR1 ampliﬁcation is observed in 10% of breast cancers (21).
Point mutations in FGFR2 are observed in 12% of endometrial
carcinomas (10) and mutations in FGFR3 are observed in
more than 30% of urothelial carcinomas (12). Cell lines
harboring these events have shown sensitivity to inhibition
by FGFR small-molecule inhibitors, and clinical trials are now
testing FGFR inhibitors in patients harboring somatic events
in FGFRs (18).
Here, we characterize FGFR2 and FGFR3 mutations observed in lung SCC and show the oncogenic potential of these
mutations using models of transformation and dependency.
We show that cells harboring these mutations are sensitive to
inhibition by several FGFR and multikinase inhibitors. In
addition, we report a case of a patient with an FGFR2-mutated
oral SCC, who responded to pazopanib, an inhibitor of multiple
tyrosine kinases including the FGFR family. Together, these
data identify a promising new therapeutic target for patients
with lung SCC and other squamous epithelial tumors.

Materials and Methods
Patient samples and genomic analysis
We manually reviewed FGFR2 and FGFR3 exome sequencing
data generated by the TCGA research network. In addition,
we queried publicly available sequencing data generated from
18 samples that were excluded from the initial TCGA report.
All data were deidentiﬁed and obtained in accordance with
patient protection standards set by the TCGA and were obtained from the TCGA Data Portal.
For the individual with a clinical response to pazopanib,
total RNA was extracted using the AllPrep DNA/RNA Mini Kit
(Qiagen; #80204). Poly-adenylated mRNA was enriched using
the Ambion MicroPoly(A)Purist Kit starting from 30 mg of total
RNA as an input according to the manufacturer's protocol.
Illumina transcriptome sequencing libraries were prepared
as previously described (25) from mRNA and from total RNA
and were subjected to 76-bp paired-end sequencing on a single
lane of an Illumina GAIIx sequencer. Sequencing reads were
ﬁrst aligned to all curated protein-coding transcripts and were
mapped back to reference human genome, hg18 as previously
described (25). Potential mutations were called using the
Uniﬁed genotyper from the GATK tool (26).
This individual was consented for the analysis according to
Institutional Protocol 94138 at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (Boston, MA). The FGFR2 P253R mutation was found in

both the total RNA-seq data and mRNA-seq data, and it was
conﬁrmed from genomic DNA by Sanger sequencing in a
Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)–certiﬁed laboratory.
Cell lines, antibodies, ligands, and inhibitors
NIH-3T3 cells and Ba/F3 cells were obtained from the
American Type Culture Collection and maintained as described
previously (10, 20). Antibodies against FGFR2 (C-8) and FRS2
(H-91) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.
Antibodies against FGFR3 (C51F2), p-FGFR, p-FRS2 (Y436),
AKT (C67E7), p-AKT (T308, 244F9), Erk 1/2 (137F5), p-Erk
1/2 (E10), and b-actin (8H10D10) were obtained from Cell
Signaling Technology, Inc.
For FGFR stimulation experiments, the FGF1 ligand was
obtained from Abcam. FGF7 and FGF9 were obtained from Life
Technologies. Interleukin-3 (IL-3) was purchased from VWR
and heparin from STEMCELL Technologies, Inc.
Ponatinib (AP24534), dovitinib (TKI258), and cediranib
(AZD2171) were obtained from Selleck Chemicals. Brivanib
alaninate (BMS-582664) was obtained from Fischer Scientiﬁc.
Pazopanib (GW786034) was obtained from Axon Medchem.
AZD4547 was obtained from Active Biochem. E7080 was obtained from American Custom Chemicals Corporation. BGJ398
was a gift from Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation.
Mutagenesis and cellular transfection and infection
Mutagenesis primers developed for each mutation were
generated using the Agilent QuikChange Primer Design tool.
FGFR2 isoforms IIIb and IIIc, and FGFR3 isoform IIIc were
cloned into pDONR223 and mutated by site-directed mutagenesis with the QuikChange Lightning Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit from Agilent Technologies. Sequence-veriﬁed
constructs were cloned into pBabe-puro and transfected into
HEK-293T cells with Fugene-6 (Promega) as described previously (10). NIH-3T3 and Ba/F3 cells were infected with the
resulting virus and after 2 days the cells were selected with
2 mg/mL puromycin.
Western blot analysis and visualization of unreduced
dimers
Cells were lysed in buffer containing 0.5% NP-40, 50 mmol/L
Tris pH 8, 150 mmol/L MgCl2, and phosphatase and protease
inhibitors, and proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and
transferred to nitrocellulose membranes via the iBlot dry
transfer system (Invitrogen). Antibody binding was detected
using the LI-COR Odyssey IR imaging system (LI-COR
Biosciences).
To visualize receptor dimers formed by ECD mutations to
cysteine residues, NIH-3T3 cells expressing the appropriate
mutations were serum-starved for 8 hours in the presence of
PBS or FGF1 and heparin, washed with PBS containing 10
mmol/L iodoacetamide, and lysed in lysis buffer containing 1%
Triton, 10% glycerol, 50 mmol/L Tris pH 7.4, and 10 mmol/L
iodoacetamide. Two 100 mg aliquots of each protein sample
were prepared, one with reducing agent and one without.
Electrophoresis was carried out using 4% to 12% Tris–glycine
SDS-PAGE gels (Invitrogen).

FGFR2 and FGFR3 Mutations in Lung Squamous Cell Carcinoma

To conﬁrm loss of phosphorylation of relevant kinases in the
presence of inhibitor, NIH-3T3 cells expressing mutated FGFR2
or FGFR3 were washed with PBS, serum-starved for 4 hours in
the presence of indicated concentrations of inhibitor, and
ligand-stimulated with FGF1 for 30 minutes before lysis.
Soft agar colony formation assays
Two milliliter of 0.5% Select agar (Gibco) and media were
plated to each well of a non-tissue culture–treated 6-well plate
and allowed to solidify. A total of 5  104 cells were suspended
in 330 mL media and mixed with 770 mL 0.5% Select agar and
media and then plated onto the solidiﬁed bottom layer in
triplicate. Plates were incubated for 3 weeks, photographed
using QuickCapture (Logitech), and quantiﬁed via ImageJ for
colony formation. Statistical comparison was conducted using
the Student t test.
To evaluate the effect of clinical inhibitors on soft agar
colony formation, the above protocol was conducted with the
following alteration: 5  104 cells were suspended in 330 mL
media plus relevant inhibitor before addition of 0.5% agar
solution and plating.
Xenograft studies
All animal experiments were carried out according to the
institutional guidelines about animal safety. Immunocompromised mice were injected with NIH-3T3 cells stably expressing
exogenous FGFR2-IIIb wild-type (WT)-, W290C-, S320C-, or
K660N-mutant isoforms. Cohorts of 7 mice were injected at
three sites for each cell type with 2 million cells per site, and
mice were observed until tumor volume reached 200 to 300
mm3. Mice were then treated with BGJ-398 at 15 mg/kg or
vehicle (PEG-300) control daily for 2 weeks, and tumor size was
measured during the treatment period.
Ba/F3 dependency and inhibitor studies
Ba/F3 cells expressing each mutation construct were
selected in media containing IL-3 and puromycin. To establish cells dependent on FGFR signaling, 3 million cells were
washed twice with PBS and seeded into 2 mL of media
containing FGF7 (for FGFR2 IIIb) or FGF9 (for FGFR2 IIIc)
and heparin. These cells were maintained until IL-3–independent cells emerged. Five thousand FGFR-dependent cells
per well were seeded into 96-well plates in 100 mL media
containing FGF and heparin. Ten microliter drug was added
in quadruplicate for ﬁnal concentrations of 0.3 nmol/L to 10
mmol/L in half logs, with two DMSO controls, and incubated
for 3 or 4 days. Fifty microliter CellTiter-Glo (Promega) was
added to each well and luminescence was measured on the
SpectraMax 5 imager. Percentage survival compared with
DMSO controls was calculated and plotted in Prism (GraphPad Software, Inc.).

Results
FGFR2 and FGFR3 are recurrently mutated in lung SCC
We analyzed whole-exome sequencing data, generated by
TCGA (4), for mutations in the FGFR2 and FGFR3 genes. We
identiﬁed ﬁve FGFR2 and six FGFR3 mutations in analysis of
exome sequencing data of 178 tumor/normal pairs, as well as

www.aacrjournals.org

an FGFR2 K660N mutation in a sample that was excluded from
the TCGA report due to poor RNA quality (TCGA-21-1083), for
a total of 12 mutations.
Patients in the reported TCGA cohort with FGFR mutations
(n ¼ 10, as one subject had two FGFR mutations) ranged from
58 to 81 years old with a median age of 73 years. All patients
were current or former smokers with a pack-year history of 9 to
63 pack-years (median, 49). Tumors were obtained from
resected specimens with a T stage of I (n ¼ 3) or II (n ¼ 7)
and N stage of 0 (n ¼ 8) or I (n ¼ 2). More extensive patient data
are available in Supplementary Table S1.
The observed mutations fell in both the extracellular and
kinase domains of FGFR2 and FGFR3, both in codons in which
mutations have been previously reported in endometrial carcinoma (10, 11) and urothelial carcinoma (12), and at novel
residues (Fig. 1A). In the samples containing FGFR2 or FGFR3
mutations, the IIIb isoforms of each protein were overexpressed compared with the IIIc isoforms (Supplementary Fig.
S1). FGFR kinase alterations were signiﬁcantly enriched in the
basal expression subtype (ref. 27; Fisher exact test; P ¼ 0.016;
Supplementary Fig. S1).
FGFR mutations cooccurred with mutations in known
oncogenes in only 3 cases. LUSC-21-1078 had a high somatic
mutation rate and harbored mutations in HRAS at codon 61
and PDGFRA at codon 842, both previously reported to be sites
of oncogenic mutation, as well as a novel ERBB2 E1021Q
mutation (Fig. 1B). LUSC-21-1078 contained a noncanonical
KRAS mutation G118S and LUSC-21-5485 had a previously
unreported ERBB2 mutation G1075V. Other samples contained
no known oncogenic somatic mutations, except that FGFR2
and FGFR3 mutations commonly cooccurred with mutations
in TP53 (8 of 10) and PIK3CA (3 of 10), the latter being a gene
with mutations that commonly cooccur with driving oncogenes. Four of 10 samples with FGFR mutation harbored 3q
ampliﬁcation of SOX2 and 2 samples CDKN2A homozygous
deletion (Fig. 1B). The presence of these events may suggest
that FGFR mutations are not solely driving oncogenesis;
however, due to the high heterogeneity observed in the lung
SCC samples, even the presence of other known oncogenic
events does not guarantee that events cooccur in cells or that
subsets of tumor cells would not be sensitive to FGFR-targeted
therapy.
FGFR2 and FGFR3 mutations drive anchorageindependent growth of NIH-3T3 cells
To determine whether the mutations identiﬁed in lung SCC
were oncogenic, we established NIH-3T3 cells stably expressing each mutation to assess anchorage-independent growth
in soft agar. We observed colony formation in cells expressing
the majority of observed FGFR2 and FGFR3 mutations (Fig.
2A). We determined that ECD mutations W290C and S320C in
FGFR2, and R248C and S249C in FGFR3, signiﬁcantly increased
colony formation compared with WT FGFR2 or FGFR3, as did
kinase domain mutations K660E and K660N in FGFR2 (P < 0.05
by Student t test). In contrast, FGFR2 mutations E471Q and
T787K, and FGFR3 mutations S435C and K717M did not form
colonies above WT. Robust formation of colonies was observed
in NIH-3T3 cells expressing an activating EGFR insertion

Figure 1. Recurrent mutations in FGFR2 and FGFR3 are observed in lung SCC. A, sequencing data from TCGA were analyzed and recurrent mutations were
observed in FGFR2 and FGFR3. The mutation S320C in FGFR2, in red, is located in the alternatively spliced exon in the IG-3 domain of FGFR2 IIIb; the
remaining mutations are annotated to the IIIc isoform. FGFR3 mutations are annotated in the IIIc isoform. B, cooccurring somatic copy number alterations and

mutation. FGFR2 mutations were generated in both common
isoforms of FGFR2 with similar results obtained for all assayed
mutations with the exception of FGFR2 T787K, which was very
modestly transforming only in isoform IIIc (Fig. 2A).
FGFR2 and FGFR3 mutations drive tumor formation in
xenograft models
NIH-3T3 cells expressing transforming FGFR2 mutations or
WT were injected into nude mice. Tumors reached approximately 200 to 300 mm3 in all mice injected with mutant cells by
day 13 and began treatment with a pan-FGFR inhibitor, BGJ398
(28), or vehicle, with ECD mutations driving particularly strong
tumor formation (Fig. 2B, solid lines). Tumors formed by cells
expressing WT FGFR2 grew more slowly, and began treatment
on day 16 (Fig. 2B).

5198

Cancer Res; 73(16) August 15, 2013

Tumors treated with BGJ398 slowed or reversed their growth
compared with vehicle (Fig. 2B, dashed lines), so that by the end
of the study, tumor burden in vehicle-treated versus BGJ398treated mice was noticeably distinct (Fig. 2C and Supplementary Fig. S2).
Extracellular domain mutations form ligand-sensitive
intermolecular disulﬁde bonds
A common mechanism of activation of the FGFR2 and FGFR3
kinases is through the formation of covalently bound receptor
dimers (29, 30). Although WT receptor tyrosine kinases maintain extracellular structure required for ligand binding and
receptor dimerization through intramolecular disulﬁde bonds,
mutant receptors can form intermolecular disulﬁde dimers
through a novel cysteine residue created by the mutation itself

Figure 2. A subset of lung SCC mutations in FGFR2 and FGFR3 is transforming in anchorage-independent growth assays and xenograft assays. A,
colony formation compared with WT in NIH-3T3 cells expressing FGFR mutations was calculated for each isoform and graphed. EGFR insNPG was
included as a positive control, and the pBabe-puro Gateway empty vector (pBp GW) was included as a negative control. P values were calculated with the
Student t test and signiﬁcance is indicated by asterisks;  , P < 0.05;   , P < 0.01;    , P < 0.001. B, nude mice injected with transforming FGFR2mutant cells from A developed tumors, which were treated with BGJ398 (dashed lines) or vehicle (solid lines). C, tumors were dissected from the mice for

or through instability created by a mutated residue near a
structural intramolecular disulﬁde bond (29). This mechanism
was previously established for FGFR3 mutations that we have
observed in lung SCC, R248C, and S249C (30).
To assess whether mutations in the ECD of FGFR2 and
FGFR3 lead to covalent dimerization, and whether dimerization could be increased by ligand stimulation, we serumstarved cells in the presence of PBS or 5 nmol/L FGF1 and 2
mg/mL heparin for 8 hours, or 5 nmol/L FGF1 and 2 mg/mL
heparin for 30 minutes, followed by washing with PBS and
serum-starving in the presence of PBS for the remaining 7.5
hours followed by electrophoresis in both reducing and nonreducing conditions. FGFR2 ECD mutations were sufﬁcient to
drive covalent dimerization in the absence of ligand, but
dimerization was increased in the presence of even 30 minutes
of ligand stimulation (Supplementary Fig. S3A). In FGFR3
mutations, on the other hand, dimerization was observed but
not increased under ligand-stimulation conditions (Supplementary Fig. S3B). As has been shown previously (31), FGFR

proteins typically form highly glycosylated folded protein
products. Although FGFR2 W290C seems to undergo a glycosylation defect contributing to its lower molecular weight, this
mutant form still retains the capacity to dimerize.
We then seeded the same cells into soft agar in the presence
of PBS, 2 mg/mL heparin alone, or 5 nmol/L FGF1 and 2 mg/mL
heparin. After 3 weeks, we observed greater colony formation
in response to FGF1 and heparin treatment than in heparin
alone or PBS-treated cells (Supplementary Fig. S3C).
FGFR2- and FGFR3-driven cellular transformation is
blocked by clinically relevant FGFR inhibitors
Having established that FGFR2 and FGFR3 mutations in lung
SCC drive anchorage-independent growth in NIH-3T3 cells, we
asked whether this transformation could be blocked by smallmolecule inhibitors of FGFRs. NIH-3T3 cells were seeded into
soft agar in the presence or absence of the multikinase inhibitor AP24534 (ponatinib), which targets imatinib-resistant
BCR-ABL (32), and has activity against FGFR family members

Figure 3. Anchorage-independent colony formation is abrogated in the presence of anti-FGFR inhibitors. A, NIH-3T3 cells expressing each
transforming mutation were seeded in the presence of increasing concentrations of ponatinib (AP24534; left) and BJG398 (right). B, cells were serumstarved and exposed to the indicated concentrations of ponatinib for 4 hours and then ligand-stimulated for 30 minutes with FGF1, after which cells
were lysed and probed via immunoblot. These experiments were carried out with several other clinical inhibitors; those results are documented in
Supplementary Fig. S4.

(33). Colony formation was inhibited in the presence of ponatinib in cells harboring activating FGFR2 or FGFR3 mutations,
but not in cells harboring an activating EGFR insertion (Fig. 3A,
left). All ECD mutations in FGFR2 and S249C in FGFR3 lost
colony-forming potential when exposed to 100 nmol/L of drug,
whereas kinase domain mutations lost colony-forming potential at 10 nmol/L of drug. Exceptions were FGFR2 K660E
expressed in the IIIc isoform, which behaved similarly to the
FGFR2 ECD mutations, and FGFR3 R248C, which had a 10-fold
higher inhibitory concentration than any other mutation, at 1
mmol/L. Colony formation driven by EGFR was not lost until
cells were exposed to 10 mmol/L of drug.
To determine whether ponatinib was inhibiting colony
formation driven by mutant FGFR2 and FGFR3, we assessed
phosphorylation of several proteins in the FGFR signaling
pathway. Levels of phospho-FGFR, phospho-FRS2, and phospho-Erk all decreased in response to increasing concentrations

of ponatinib (Fig. 3B), suggesting that colony formation was
lost due to a decrease in FGFR-mediated signaling.
To evaluate whether ponatinib was acting by speciﬁc inhibition of FGFR kinases, these assays were also conducted with
BGJ398, a selective FGFR kinase inhibitor (28) as well as
pazopanib (GW786034; ref. 34) and dovitinib (TKI-258; ref. 35),
two multikinase inhibitors with speciﬁcity for FGFR family
members. Colony formation was inhibited by at least 50% in
the presence of 10 nmol/L BGJ398 for all cells expressing FGFR
mutations, whereas cells expressing the activating EGFR insertion did not lose the capacity for colony formation until 1
mmol/L BGJ398 (Fig. 3A, right), and WT phosphorylation was
lost at 10 nmol/L under ligand stimulation conditions (Supplementary Fig. S4A). Dovitinib also inhibited colony formation in cells expressing mutant FGFR compared with activated
EGFR, but with less uniformity across mutations. FGFR2 ECD
mutations lost 50% colony formation between 100 nmol/L and

FGFR2 and FGFR3 Mutations in Lung Squamous Cell Carcinoma

1 mmol/L dovitinib. In contrast, colony formation was inhibited
by 50% between 10 and 100 nmol/L for FGFR2 kinase domain
mutations excluding K660E IIIc, which behaved similarly to the
FGFR2 ECD mutations. Cells expressing FGFR3 R248C and
S249C were sensitive between 10 and 100 nmol/L. Again, cells
transformed by mutant EGFR did not lose colony formation
until exposed to 10 mmol/L drug (Supplementary Fig. S4B, left).
Mutant EGFR-expressing cells had sustained phosphorylation
at AKT T308 up to 10 mmol/L dovitinib, as detected by immunoblot, whereas detectable AKT phosphorylation was lost by
100 nmol/L to 1 mmol/L dovitinib in cells expressing FGFR
mutations (Supplementary Fig. S4C). Pazopanib similarly
inhibited colony formation in cells expressing all FGFR2 and
FGFR3 mutations at concentrations of 100 nmol/L to 1 mmol/L
drug, whereas cells expressing mutant EGFR formed colonies
even in the presence of 10 mmol/L drug (Supplementary Fig.
S4B, right). Consistently, biochemical studies revealed sustained AKT T308 phosphorylation in mutant EGFR cells
exposed to 10 mmol/L pazopanib, whereas detectable AKT
T308 phosphorylation was lost in mutant FGFR cells at 100
nmol/L to 1 mmol/L pazopanib (Supplementary Fig. S4D).
In NIH-3T3 cells expressing the ECD mutations of both
FGFR2 and FGFR3 and in the kinase domain mutation FGFR2
K660E IIIc, we observed that low concentrations of ponatinib
(10 nmol/L) conferred a growth-promoting phenotype above
control, which was abrogated at higher concentrations (Fig. 3A,
left). This could be due to the multikinase inhibitory properties
of ponatinib, which may inhibit a second kinase that could
impact FGFR2 or FGFR3 signaling. This phenomenon was also
observed when these experiments were carried out with the two
other multikinase inhibitors with anti-FGFR activity, pazopanib
and dovitinib (Supplementary Fig. S4B), but not with BGJ398, a
more selective FGFR kinase inhibitor (Fig. 3A, right).
Analysis of FGFR2 and FGFR3 inhibition in IL-3–
independent Ba/F3 cells
To test whether cellular transformation driven by mutated
FGFR2 could be abrogated in a second system by smallmolecule FGFR inhibitors and to test the relative efﬁcacy of
these compounds, we generated Ba/F3 cells expressing the
FGFR2 mutations that had shown signiﬁcant colony formation
in the NIH-3T3 anchorage-independent assay. These cell lines
were dependent on FGFR signaling in the presence of FGF and
heparin, and in the absence of IL-3. Phosphorylation of the
FGFR kinase domain and FRS2 were measured by immunoblot,
and interestingly, cells expressing FGFR2 K660E IIIc showed a
greater degree of phosphorylation of both molecules despite
similar expression levels as compared with cells expressing
other mutations (Fig. 4A).
Ba/F3 cells expressing WT and mutated FGFR2 transgenes
were ﬁrst seeded into media containing increasing concentrations of ponatinib. We observed that ponatinib inhibited IL-3–
independent proliferation of Ba/F3 cells expressing the FGFR
mutations at about 10 nmol/L of drug treatment, but cells
expressing an EGFR-activating insertion or parental Ba/F3
cells grown in the presence of IL-3 were only inhibited by
10 mmol/L of drug (Fig. 4B, left). IC50 values for Ba/F3 cells
expressing each mutant were also calculated and plotted (Fig.

www.aacrjournals.org

4C, left). These assays were also conducted on cells seeded into
media containing BGJ398, and similarly, cells expressing FGFR
mutations, but not the EGFR insertion or parental Ba/F3 cells,
were inhibited at about 10 nmol/L inhibitory concentrations of
drug (Fig. 4B, right and Fig. 4C, right). Interestingly, insensitive
controls in the presence of ponatinib seemed to gain a growth
advantage in the presence of drug at concentrations in the
range of 10 to 100 nmol/L (Fig. 4B), similar to our observations
in the anchorage-independent colony formation assay (Fig. 3A
and Supplementary Fig. S4B).
To further assess the potency of small-molecule FGFR kinase
inhibitors in the Ba/F3 system, we assembled a panel of FGFR
kinase inhibitors described in the literature (refs. 28, 32–39;
Supplementary Table S2) and tested the Ba/F3 inhibitory
response in the presence of each. Each of these inhibitors
showed similar trends to those seen for ponatinib and BGJ398:
a multi-log increase in drug sensitivity in cells expressing FGFR
mutations compared with controls (Supplementary Fig. S5).
IC50 values for each mutation in the presence of each drug were
also calculated (Supplementary Fig. S5). Strikingly, FGFR2
K660E expressed in the IIIc isoform (in yellow) repeatedly
exhibited a 5- to 10-fold higher IC50 concentration as compared
with the IIIb isoform and either isoform of the K660N mutation
in the FGFR2 kinase domain (Supplementary Fig. S5). This
observation was consistent with the concentrations at which
anchorage-independent growth observed for FGFR2 K660E IIIc
was lost in the presence of several inhibitors (Fig. 3A and
Supplementary Fig. S4B).
Case report of a head and neck SCC patient responding to
an FGFR inhibitor
We identiﬁed an individual with SCC of the head and neck who
was found to harbor an extracellular FGFR2 mutation (p.P253R)
in a biopsy specimen (Fig. 5A). This mutation was initially
identiﬁed in RNA sequencing data and then conﬁrmed by Sanger
sequencing in a CLIA-certiﬁed laboratory (Fig. 5B). FGFR2
mutations have previously been observed at low frequencies in
head and neck cancer (40, 41), and conﬁrmed by initial reports
from TCGA where seven mutations were observed in exome
sequencing data of 279 individuals as of October 1, 2012 (data
obtained from the TCGA Data Coordinating Center). FGFR2
P253R has previously been observed in endometrial carcinoma
(10). Cellular and biochemical analysis of the FGFR2 P253R
mutation suggest that this event is transforming and sensitive
to targeted therapies in our assays, similar to the events observed
in lung SCC (Supplementary Fig. S6).
The patient was diagnosed with locally advanced (T2N1M0,
stage III) SCC of the right tongue in 2008 at the age of 52 years.
He had no history of tobacco use or alcohol abuse and was
treated with a right hemiglossectomy and postoperative radiotherapy. He subsequently developed recurrences in the right
and left neck over a period of 3 years and was treated with
surgery, two additional courses of radiotherapy and multiple
courses of chemotherapy including carboplatin, paclitaxel,
cisplatin, and cetuximab. In 2012, he had further progression
in the right neck and left axilla. He began daily treatment with
800 mg pazopanib starting on April 12, 2012. At this time, he
had gross disease in the right neck (Fig. 5C, left). A follow-up

Figure 4. Ba/F3 cells dependent on FGFR signaling are sensitive to FGFR inhibitors. A, Ba/F3 cells dependent on FGFR signaling were isolated by
exchanging IL-3 with FGF-7 or FGF-9 and heparin. These cells were lysed and probed for FGFR2 or FGFR3 expression, phospho-FGFR, FRS2, and phosphoFRS2 Y436. Actin was used as a loading control. B, Ba/F3 cells expressing each mutation construct were seeded into 96-well plates in the
presence of increasing concentrations of ponatinib (left) or BGJ398 (right). After 4 days, proliferation was measured with CellTiter-Glo. C, IC50 values were
calculated for each mutation. These experiments were carried out with other FGFR inhibitors; those results are documented in Supplementary Fig. S5.

visit 12 days later showed a marked reduction in tumor size
(Fig. 5C, right). He continued on pazopanib for 2 months, when
he presented with a right carotid hemorrhage. Pazopanib was
discontinued at that time, and the patient remains alive as of
March 15, 2013 under hospice care. This correlative observation does not deﬁnitively identify FGFR2 as the target of
pazopanib, but we believe that this result provides compelling

rationale to continue to pursue treatment of FGFR2-mutated
tumors with anti-FGFR–targeted therapies.

Discussion

recurrent FGFR2 and FGFR3 mutations, which are signiﬁcant
given that germline FGFR mutations are known to be pathogenic (17), that somatic mutations have been described in
other malignancies (18), and that focal FGFR1 ampliﬁcation is
known to occur in lung SCC and seems to be a therapeutic
target (15, 16).
We have conﬁrmed that a subset of observed mutations
drive transformation in NIH-3T3 cells in an anchorage-independent growth assay and xenograft assays, and that this is
reversible by pan-FGFR and multikinase inhibitors. Some
mutations were not transforming, but given the very high
somatic mutation rate in lung SCC, this observation is not
surprising. We found that ECD mutations in FGFR2 are able to
form ligand-sensitive covalent receptor-dimers, as has been
observed in other FGFR2 ECD mutations (29) and in FGFR3
mutations that have been described previously in urothelial
carcinoma, and that we also observe here in the lung SCC
data (30). This ﬁnding is especially relevant given that the
FGFR2 W290C mutation has been observed independently in
lung SCC sequencing on two previous occasions (10, 42). It is
also possible that the glycosylation deﬁciency that we observed
in the expressed protein harboring this mutation impacts
protein function, a phenomenon with precedence in this
receptor family (31).
We found that the FGFR mutations also exhibited sensitivity
to inhibition by FGFR inhibitors in the Ba/F3 system, which
models dependency on oncogenic pathways. Many drugs in the
panel of inhibitors that we tested are already approved for
clinical use in other malignancies, and clinical trials are
underway to test sensitivity to FGFR inhibitors in patients
harboring FGFR events (NCT01004224, NCT01457846, and
NCT00979134). Although we cannot infer in vivo sensitivity to
these inhibitors from our models, we believe that this study
provides a compelling rationale for extending trials of FGFR
kinase inhibitors to patients with lung and oral SCC harboring
FGFR2 or FGFR3 mutations.
This study represents one of the ﬁrst functionally validated
novel recurrent targets to emerge from analysis of the systematic genomic proﬁling of lung SCC by the TCGA Research
Network. It is our expectation that these ﬁndings will continue
with the publication of more genomic studies of malignancies,

and that this will lead to improved treatment options for
patients with this disease.
