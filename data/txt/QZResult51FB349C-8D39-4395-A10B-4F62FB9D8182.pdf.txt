Quo Vadis: Advanced Prostate Cancer—Clinical Care and
Clinical Research in the Era of Multiple Androgen
Receptor-Directed Therapies
Won Kim, MD; and Charles J. Ryan, MD

The novel androgen receptor-directed therapies abiraterone acetate and enzalutamide, having demonstrated improved survival in
randomized phase 3 studies of men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, have ushered in a new era in the treatment
of this disease. Additional novel androgen receptor-directed therapies, such as ARN-509 and orteronel, are in various phases of clinical trials and development. However, the emergence of therapeutic resistance and clinical disease progression is inevitable. Although
advances in genomic technologies have led to unprecedented understanding of the biology of castration-resistant prostate cancer,
efforts only now are underway to elucidate the mechanisms of resistance associated with abiraterone and enzalutamide. A tremendous challenge in the near future will be to determine the optimal sequence or combination of therapies to overcome resistance
mechanisms. In this review, the current landscape of androgen receptor-directed therapies and future directions necessary to

INTRODUCTION
Prostate cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed malignancy in men and is responsible for >250,000 cancerrelated deaths worldwide.1 Although surgery and radiotherapy offer curative potential for men with localized prostate cancer, men with advanced prostate cancer are burdened with an incurable disease. Androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) is
the standard of care for men with advanced prostate cancer and has been so for more than 70 years.2 Unfortunately, virtually all men who receive ADT eventually experience progression to the lethal form of the disease: metastatic castrationresistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Typically, death occurs 2 to 4 years after the onset of castration-resistance.
Docetaxel received regulatory approval in 2004 as the first therapy to prolong overall survival in patients with
mCRPC.3 Since 2010, 5 additional agents—cabazitaxel,4 sipuleucel-T,5 abiraterone acetate,6,7 enzalutamide,8,15 and radium-2239—have demonstrated profound survival impact on the lives of patients with mCRPC and have received regulatory approval (Table 1). Among these, the novel androgen receptor (AR)-targeted therapies abiraterone acetate and
enzalutamide have the broadest clinical use. These therapies have provided new promise to patients with advanced prostate
cancer; however, mCRPC remains incurable, causing great physical, emotional, and financial burdens. In this review, we
examine the current landscape of AR-targeted therapies and how it may shape the future of clinical research and care of
patients with advanced prostate cancer.
Current Landscape of AR-Targeted Therapies
Abiraterone acetate

Cytochrome P450 17A1 (CYP17A1) is the rate-limiting enzyme in gonadal and extragonadal (ie, adrenal glands, prostate)
androgen synthesis. Abiraterone acetate, the prodrug of abiraterone, is a potent CYP17A1 inhibitor that suppresses circulating serum androgens beyond what is possible through ADT alone (Fig. 1). In a phase 3 study of men with mCRPC
postchemotherapy (COU-AA-301), treatment with the combination of abiraterone and prednisone improved survival
compared with prednisone alone (14.8 months vs 10.9 months; hazard ratio [HR], 0.65; P<.001), leading to its initial
regulatory approval in 2011.6 All secondary endpoints favored the patients who received abiraterone, including the time
to prostate-specific antigen (PSA) progression (TPP) (10.2 months vs 6.6 months; P<.001), progression-free survival
(PFS) (5.6 months vs 3.6 months; P<.001), and the PSA response rate (PSA decline 50%: 29% vs 6%; P<.001). In a

with mCRPC (COU-AA-302) in which the coprimary
endpoints were radiographic PFS (rPFS) and overall survival (OS), abiraterone again was superior to placebo
(rPFS: HR, 0.43; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.350.52; P<.001; OS: HR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.61-0.93;
P<.01).7 Secondary endpoints, including risk of decline
in Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance
status, time to the initiation of cytotoxic chemotherapy,
time to opiate use for cancer-related pain, and TPP,
favored the abiraterone arm.
Abiraterone requires the concomitant administration
of prednisone to mitigate toxicities that result directly from
the potent inhibition of CYP17A1 and the compensatory
rise in adrenocorticotropic hormone, which leads to dramatically increased levels of adrenal steroid hormones upstream
362

of CYP17A1 with potent mineralocorticoid activity.10,11
Therefore, in addition to the side effects caused by mineralocorticoid excess, such as hypertension, hypokalemia, and
edema, the potential toxicities associated with long-term
prednisone use must be considered for patients who are
under consideration for abiraterone treatment. Furthermore,
recent investigations regarding ligand-receptor promiscuity
of nuclear hormone receptors12,13 and its potential role in
therapeutic response and resistance raises further questions
regarding steroid use. However, the clinical application of
that work requires further clinical validation.
Enzalutamide

Enzalutamide is a novel antiandrogen that antagonizes the
AR more potently than the previous generation of antiandrogens (eg, bicalutamide). Preclinical studies have

Figure 1. Androgen-receptor (AR)-directed therapies and mechanisms of action are illustrated, including novel androgen synthesis inhibitors and antiandrogens, and their mechanisms of action. Orteronel is a selective 17a-hydroxylase/C (17,20-lyase) inhibitor,
but it loses its selectivity at high concentrations. Galeterone is a selective 17,20-lyase inhibitor and also acts as an AR antagonist
and increases the rate of AR degradation. DOC indicates docetaxel; 17-OH, 17-hydroxy; CFG 920, a nonsteroidal cytochrome

demonstrated that enzalutamide binds to the AR with 8fold greater affinity than bicalutamide and is active as an
inhibitor in cells with AR amplification and cells in
which bicalutamide has agonist activity.14 Administered
orally on a daily schedule, enzalutamide is generally well
tolerated even in long-term use. In a randomized phase 3
study of 1199 men with mCRPC who had progressed after docetaxel chemotherapy (AFFIRM), enzalutamide
demonstrated significantly improved OS compared with
placebo (18.4 months vs 13.6 month; HR, 0.63;
P<.001), leading to early unblinding of the study.8
Enzalutamide was superior to placebo for all secondary
endpoints, including PSA response rate (54% vs 2%;
P<.001), soft tissue response rate (29% vs 4%; P<.001),
and rPFS (8.3 months vs 2.9 months; HR, 0.40;

2013 in the postchemotherapy setting.

A second phase 3 study of enzalutamide versus placebo in chemotherapy-naive patients with mCRPC (PREVAIL) focused on the coprimary endpoints of rPFS and
OS.15 Enzalutamide demonstrated a significant benefit in
both endpoints, with a 30% reduction in the risk of death
(HR, 0.70; P<.0001) and an 81% reduction in the risk of
radiographic progression or death (HR, 0.19; P<.0001).
The median OS was 32.4 months in the enzalutamide
arm versus 30.2 months in the placebo arm.
In the AFFIRM study, 5 of 800 patients who received
enzalutamide had seizures, and there were no seizures in the
control arm. In the PREVAIL study, 2 patients had seizures
(1 patient in each study arm). Enzalutamide is known to
cross the blood-brain barrier, and it is possible that it lowers
the seizure threshold in some patients. Although rare,
patients who have a history of seizures or other predisposition to seizures should not receive enzalutamide.

Considerations

The postchemotherapy phase 3 studies of abiraterone and
enzalutamide were placebo-controlled (placebo plus prednisone in the abiraterone study), because there were no
“standard-of-care” treatment options known to prolong
survival in this disease setting. However, it is fair to question whether placebo was the appropriate control for the
prechemotherapy phase 3 trials of these drugs. The clinical
benefit of docetaxel was known for years before those trials,
and sipuleucel-T demonstrated its survival benefit in a
phase 3 trial that was published before the enrollment period of the PREVAIL study (COU-AA-302 had completed
enrollment before publication). That said, prostate cancer
is a disease of older men, and many patients with mCRPC
do not receive chemotherapy because of comorbidities, toxicities, or patient preferences. Sipuleucel-T is an option
only for patients who have asymptomatic (or minimally
symptomatic) mCRPC and does not impact the time to
disease progression. Thus, abiraterone and enzalutamide
represent effective and tolerable options for many patients,
and their broad clinical use currently serves as evidence that
the studies were conducted in a population in dire need.
In addition, the phase 3 chemotherapy-naive studies used coprimary efficacy endpoints of rPFS and OS.
rPFS was defined as freedom from death from any cause
and freedom from progression of soft tissue or bone
lesions.7 The rationale for using rPFS as a coprimary
endpoint stems from the finding that mCRPC is a disease with long median OS,16 with multiple clinical
events (eg, PSA progression, radiographic progression,
decline in functional status, need for cytotoxic chemotherapy) that occur before death. Thus, the addition of
rPFS to OS as a coprimary endpoint may provide a more
comprehensive assessment benefit attributable an intervention. Both abiraterone and enzalutamide demonstrated significant improvement in rPFS. Enzalutamide
also improved OS compared with placebo in this patient
population; abiraterone demonstrated a strong trend toward OS improvement, but it fell short of statistical significance. Nevertheless, in the United States, the label for
abiraterone was expanded to the chemotherapy-naive
space based on these results; enzalutamide just recently
received US FDA approval for its expanded indication
after a priority review.
AR-Directed Therapies in Development:
Androgen Synthesis Inhibitors
Orteronel (TAK-700)

Orteronel, an imidazole derivative, is also an inhibitor of
CYP17A1 although, unlike abiraterone, it is a nonsteroi364

dal and reversible inhibitor. In addition, it is highly selective for 17,20-lyase (although, at higher concentrations, it
does lose some selectivity and also inhibits 17a-hydroxylase).17 A theoretical advantage of selective 17,20-lyase inhibition is that it may obviate the need for corticosteroid
administration to mitigate the side effects associated with
mineralocorticoid excess; the approved label for abiraterone acetate requires the daily coadministration of 10 mg
prednisone.
A phase 1/2 study in 96 patients with mCRCP
demonstrated that orteronel (at various dose cohorts,
including patients who did or did not receive prednisone) is well tolerated. The most common grade 3
adverse events were fatigue (9%) and diarrhea (3%).
Orteronel also was clinically active, and 41% to 63% of
patients (at various dose cohorts) achieved a PSA decline
50%.18 It is noteworthy that the side-effect profile was
similar to that of abiraterone acetate.
Based on these data, 2 phase 3 studies of orteronel
were initiated in patients with mCRPC (before and after
docetaxel, mirroring the abiraterone and enzalutamide
experiences). An interim analysis of the postchemotherapy
study (ELM-PC 5) resulted in early termination for failing to satisfy the primary endpoint of improved OS.19 It
is worth noting that the median OS in patients who
received orteronel was 17.0 months versus 15.2 months
for patients who received placebo (HR, 0.88; 95% CI,
0.739-1.062; P5.1898), comparing favorably to the abiraterone experience in similar patients. There were no
safety concerns.20 Similarly, results from the interim analysis of orteronel in patients with chemotherapy-naive
mCRPC (ELM-PC 4) failed to demonstrate a significant
improvement in OS, although it did produce a significant
improvement in rPFS.21 One of the reasons posited for
the negative findings in those studies is that efficacious
poststudy treatments became available during the study
periods, as discussed further below. Currently, a randomized, phase 3, cooperative group study of orteronel with or
without ADT in patients with metastatic, hormonesensitive prostate cancer is ongoing (National Clinical
Trials [clinicaltrials.gov] identifier NCT01809691).
Galeterone (TOK-001)

Galeterone is a potent CYP17A1 inhibitor that, in preclinical studies, has demonstrated greater potency than abiraterone acetate.22 In addition, galeterone has potent, direct ARantagonist activity as well as the effect of AR downregulation. Therefore, galeterone interrupts AR activity
through multiple mechanisms. In a phase 1 study of 49
patients with mCRPC, galeterone was safe and well

tolerated, with grade 3 and 4 adverse events occurring at a
frequency of 8% and 1%, respectively, and 11 patients
(22%) had a PSA decline 50%. A phase 2 study of galeterone in patients with mCRPC is ongoing
(NCT01709734).
AR-Directed Therapies in Development:
Antianderogens
ARN-509

Like enzalutamide, ARN-509 is a potent AR antagonist
that does not demonstrate significant AR-agonist activity,23 particularly in the presence of amplified AR, which
is common in the castration-resistant setting.24 In prostate
cancer cell lines, ARN-509 bound to AR with 5-fold to
10-fold greater affinity than bicalutamide; and, in murine
xenograft models of mCRPC, it demonstrated greater
antitumor activity than enzalutamide, with pharmacokinetic characteristics that potentially predicted a higher
therapeutic index (maximal efficacy observed at lower
steady-state plasma and brain levels compared with enzalutamide). In a phase 1 study of 39 patients with progressive mCRPC, ARN-509 was safe and well tolerated, with
4 grade 3 adverse events reported (3 which were considered unrelated to treatment; no seizures were reported).
ARN-509 demonstrated clinical efficacy: 18 patients
(60%) demonstrated a PSA decline 50%, and 5 of 10
evaluable patients who had measureable soft tissue lesions
had a response of stable disease after >6 months.25
Preliminary results from the phase 2 study, at the
recommended ARN-509 dose of 240 mg daily, were
reported in 2013. Forty-six chemotherapy-naive patients
with mCRPC (25 treatment-naive, 21 postabiraterone
therapy) were enrolled; and, at 12 weeks, 88% of the
treatment-naive patients and 29% of the postabiraterone
patients experienced a PSA response according to Prostate
Cancer Clinical Trials Working Group (PCWG-2) criteria.26 The phase 2 study also enrolled 47 patients with
nonmetastatic CRPC, and 91% of those patients experienced a PSA response at 12 weeks.27 Ongoing studies of
ARN-509 include: a phase 3, placebo-controlled trial of
ARN-509 in patients with nonmetastatic CRPC
(NCT01946204); a phase 1b trial of ARN-509 in combination with abiraterone acetate and prednisone
(NCT01792687); and a phase 2 randomized trial of
ARN-509 in patients with biochemically relapsed,
hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (NCT01790126).
In the Pipeline

There are multiple AR-directed therapies in early stages of
clinical development. These include the following:
Cancer

February 1, 2015

1. CFG-920, a nonsteroidal CYP17 inhibitor, currently
in a phase 1/2 clinical trial (NCT01647789);
2. VT-464, a nonsteroidal selective inhibitor of 17,20lyase, currently in a phase 1 trial (NCT02012920);
3. ODM-201, an antiandrogen that, in preclinical models, does not cross the brain-blood barrier, currently in
a phase 2 clinical trial (NCT01429064);
4. AZD-3514, an oral drug that modulates AR signaling
by 1) inhibition of AR nuclear translocation; and 2)
down-regulation of AR levels28; AZD-3514 is in a
phase 1 clinical trial (NCT01162395); and
5. EZN-4176, an antisense oligonucleotide that binds to
and degrades AR messenger RNA, leading to decreased
AR expression; the phase 1 study was suspended,
because dose escalation was limited by toxicities.29
The profound impact demonstrated by abiraterone
acetate and enzalutamide and the promising clinical activity
of many AR-targeted drugs in development offer promise
to the many patients burdened by advanced prostate cancer. However, to maximize the benefits of these therapies,
further investigations are necessary on many fronts.
Resistance to AR-Directed Therapies

The oncogenic landscape of prostate cancer continues to
be explored and charted through efforts fueled by advances in next-generation sequencing,30-34 leading to unprecedented understanding of the genetic basis of prostate
cancer, providing investigators with a glimpse of the incredible molecular and clinical heterogeneity of the disease, and offering the possibility of precision medicine.
However, in the era of targeted therapies, it is now necessary to take into account that the biology of prostate cancer that is resistant to abiraterone or enzalutamide (or
both) is likely to be distinct from the disease that was previously termed simply castration-resistant prostate cancer
(CRPC).
Resistance to abiraterone and enzalutamide typically
develops within 6 to 18 months of treatment initiation.
Preclinical studies and increasing widespread clinical experience with these agents are elucidating various mechanisms
of resistance associated with AR-targeted therapy, and similar resistance is expected for the AR-targeted therapies currently in development. Key potential resistance
mechanisms against novel AR-directed therapies include
further up-regulation of CYP17A1 activity and steroidogenesis35,36; alterations in the AR itself, including AR
mutations37,38 and splice variants35,39 that may promote
ligand-independent activation of the AR signaling cascade;
the promiscuous behavior of nuclear receptors,13 including

Efforts are underway to understand mechanisms of resistance associated with the targeted treatment of advanced
prostate cancer, and AR-directed therapies are a particular
focus, including the 2 Stand Up 2 Cancer-Prostate Cancer
Foundation “Dream Team” projects.44,45 The promise of
these efforts, which rely on multicenter expertise and collaboration, have generated great excitement.
In addition, CRPC, which, over the past decade, has
become the standard umbrella term to describe the disease
state after progression on primary ADT, may no longer be
adequate in this era of multiple therapeutic options. Terms
that describe the disease state with regard to both the ligand
and the receptor may be necessary to convey the disease
biology (Table 2). For example, “androgen-dependent, receptor-dependent CRPC” may describe a cancer that has
progressed after abiraterone but remains dependent on
increased steroidogenesis; whereas “androgen-independent,
receptor-dependent CRPC” may describe prostate cancer
that has progressed through an AR variant that allows
ligand-independent activation.46

Sequential and Combination Therapy

In light of the resistance mechanisms associated with ARdirected therapy, clinician investigators have initiated
studies (Table 3) to answer 2 key questions: First, what is
366

the optimal sequencing of therapy; and, second, what is the
role of combination therapy?

Sequencing

The first phase 3 studies of both abiraterone acetate and
enzalutamide were conducted in postchemotherapy
patients and excluded prior receipt of the other agent. In
the COU-AA-301 study, the PSA response rate was 29%,
the median time to PSA progression was 10.2 months,
and the median rPFS was 5.6 months. By comparison, in
the COU-AA-302 study, the PSA response rate was 62%,
the median time to PSA progression was 11.1 months,
and the rPFS was 16.5 months. Similarly, in the AFFIRM
study, the PSA response rate was 54%, the median time to
PSA progression was 8.3 months, and the median rPFS
was 8.3 months. In the PREVAIL study, the PSA response
rate was 78%, the median time to PSA progression was
11.2 months, and the median rPFS was not yet reach (the
lower bound of the 95% CI was 13.8 months). In addition, in retrospective analysis, the clinical activity of docetaxel after disease progression on abiraterone appeared to
be less than expected.47 Although any direct comparisons
of these results are not conclusive, along with preclinical
evidence pointing to the potential cross-resistance
between AR-directed therapies and taxanes,48 at least they
raise the issue of sequencing these agents. Whether a clinical trial is appropriate to answer this question is up for
debate. Based on the magnitude of benefit in the prechemotherapy setting, abiraterone has already been approved
in the prechemotherapy space, and it is likely that enzalutamide will follow shortly. The early clinical use of

abiraterone (and even enzalutamide) by clinicians before
chemotherapy may obviate this question.
A more relevant question may be whether there is a
role for sequencing the AR-directed therapies (ie, abiraterone followed by enzalutamide, or vice versa). Retrospective studies have demonstrated moderate clinical activity
when 1 AR-directed therapy is followed by the other,49-55
with a median PFS of 3 to 4 months. However, there are
some patients who do have significant clinical responses
after progression on 1 AR-directed therapy, and prior
response to abiraterone or enzalutamide is not predictive
of a response to the other. Recently reported findings
regarding potential mechanisms of resistance to ARtargeted therapies may shed some light. AR-V7 is a constitutively active AR splice variant that is present in patients
with mCRPC. In a small study of 62 patients who were
about to begin treatment with enzalutamide or abiraterone (31 patients in each arm), the AR-V7 variant was
identified in 18 men (29%).56 None of those 18 patients
with the AR-V7 variant experienced a PSA response to either enzalutamide or abiraterone, whereas 27 of the 44
patients (62%) without the variant experienced a PSA
response. It is noteworthy that 11 of the 12 AR-V7Cancer

February 1, 2015

positive patients (92%) who were about to begin enzalutamide had previously received abiraterone, and 2 of the 6
AR-V7-positive patients (33%) who were about to begin
abiraterone had previously received enzalutamide.
Another study evaluated AR amplification status using
fluorescence in situ hybridization in 33 patients with
mCRPC.57 In that study, of 16 patients who were
abiraterone-naive and enzalutamide-naive, 81% had AR
amplification. In 11 patients who were resistant to abiraterone, 9% had AR amplification; and, in 6 patients who
were resistant to enzalutamide, 66% had AR amplification. Although these were small studies, they suggest that
the mechanisms of resistance to these AR-targeted therapies may indeed be distinct and that AR-V7 or AR amplification status may have a role as a biomarker in
predicting response to abiraterone or enzalutamide. Furthermore, AR splice variant or amplification status may
be able to determine whether sequencing AR-targeted
therapies is a feasible strategy. For example, if the AR-V7
splice variant is identified in a patient who previously
received abiraterone, then further treatment with enzalutamide may be futile; or a patient who previously received
enzalutamide who retains AR amplification and is AR367

Review Article

V7-negative may yet respond to abiraterone. These are
conjectures based on preliminary results from small studies; clearly, prospectively analytical and clinical validation
is necessary for any clinical application. However, these
exciting findings provide a potential strategy by which
clinicians may 1 day make treatment decisions.
Combinations

In general, combination treatments in advanced prostate
cancer have not proven fruitful, although combination
approaches with the novel agents discussed above have
not yet been thoroughly evaluated. Docetaxel has been
combined with calcitriol,58 risedronate,59 atrasentan,60
zibotentan,61 bevacizumab,62 aflibercept,63 and dasatinib64 in large, randomized, placebo-controlled phase 3
studies, and all studies have been negative. However, it
can be pointed out that, in every 1 of those trials, docetaxel was combined with a second agent that had not independently demonstrated survival benefit in patients with
mCRPC. The current era, with multiple therapies available that have demonstrated survival benefit and promising therapies in clinical development (particularly ARdirected therapies), offers renewed promise. Rational
combination therapies that address the various disease
states in mCRPC have the potential to improve clinical
outcomes for men with advanced prostate cancer. For
example, in “androgen-dependent, AR-dependent
CRPC,” it should be considered whether targeting both
androgen synthesis and the AR concurrently can improve
outcomes compared with sequential or monotherapy. A
phase 3 clinical trial of enzalutamide with or without abiraterone (NCT01949337) will soon begin to enroll
patients. Also, a phase 1 study of ARN-509 with abiraterone is ongoing (NCT01792687) and may lead to further
investigation of this combination.
Additional Considerations

Another relevant question to be answered is whether the
earlier use of AR-directed drugs like abiraterone and enzalutamide may prove to be the optimal use of these agents. A
phase 2 trial of enzalutamide monotherapy in men with
hormone therapy-naive prostate cancer produced impressive results: at 25 weeks, 93% of patients had a PSA decline
80%, for a median PSA decline of 99.6%.65 Currently,
there are ongoing, randomized phase 3 studies of ADT
with or without abiraterone (NCT017152825) or orteronel (NCT01809691) in patients with newly diagnosed,
metastatic, hormone-naive prostate cancer. Furthermore,
studies of abiraterone in the neoadjuvant space have
reported promising results,66,67 and additional studies in
368

both the neoadjuvant and adjuvant settings for high-risk
prostate cancer are ongoing (NCT01946165, abiraterone
and luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist with
or without enzalutamide before surgery; NCT01927627,
enzalutamide in patients with high-risk prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy; NCT02023463, enzalutamide,
radiation, and hormone therapy for patients with
intermediate-risk or high-risk prostate cancer).
Looking forward, a fresh perspective on the process
of therapy development is in order. Since 2010, 5 new
agents have been approved, each or which has demonstrated improved OS in men with mCRPC. Given the
paucity of therapeutic options available at the time, the
improvement in OS depended largely on the efficacy of
the drug in question. Abiraterone and enzalutamide in
both the chemotherapy-naive studies and the postchemotherapy phase 3 studies were compared with placebo, as
discussed above. Given the current standard of care, placebo will no longer be an acceptable control arm in clinical trials of patients with mCRPC. Appropriate control
arms should be determined according to: 1) the patient
population, ie, for asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic patients, an appropriate control arm may be
sipuleucel-T or the AR-targeted therapies, whereas, in
patients with symptomatic disease, chemotherapy may be
more appropriate; and 2) the disease state, ie, (in the
chemotherapy-naive space, abiraterone or enzalutamide
would be reasonable choices, and sipuleucel-T also would
be a reasonable choice for in asymptomatic patients;
whereas, in the postdocetaxel space, cabazitaxel or
radium-223 may be reasonable options. Practically speaking, because the AR-targeted therapies abiraterone and
enzalutamide are in broadest clinical use, they may serve
as an appropriate control arm for the majority of patient
populations. In any case, the bar for improved OS will
become more difficult to clear. Furthermore, the efficacy
of sequential and subsequent therapies may preclude the
further use of OS as a primary clinical trial endpoint, and
surrogate and intermediate markers of clinical benefit in
mCRPC are needed. This is illustrated in the recently
reported results from the ELM-PC5 study of orteronel in
postchemotherapy mCRPC and the ELM-PC4 study of
orteronel in chemotherapy-naive patients, neither of
which met their primary endpoints of efficacy. To further
illustrate this point, in ELM-PC5, the median rPFS for
the treatment versus placebo arms were 8.3 months and
5.7 months, respectively (HR, 0.76; P5.00038), which is
comparable to the median rPFS reported in the phase 3
COU-AA-301 and AFFIRM studies. In addition, the median OS for the placebo arm in the ELM-PC5 study was
Cancer

February 1, 2015

AR-Directed Therapies in Prostate CA/Kim and Ryan

longer than that for the placebo arm in the COU-AA-301
study, which may be an indication of a poststudy treatment effect on OS (the placebo arms of most contemporary trials have outperformed those of older trials, and the
efficacy of poststudy treatment options available is a major
reason). Furthermore, subgroup analyses demonstrated
an OS benefit in the non-European and non-North
American cohort, in which access to abiraterone was limited (and enzalutamide use was nonexistent).
Thus, as novel therapies continue to advance through
the clinical development pipeline, investigators must consider whether alternate endpoints (ie, surrogates) should be
considered to define the true treatment effect of a drug.68
For example, the label for abiraterone has been expanded
based on the primary endpoint of rPFS. Other candidate
surrogates include enumeration of circulating tumor cells,
novel imaging biomarkers, and patient-reported outcomes.68-70 Also, it is possible that these can be used in
combination with known prognostic factors, such as serum
lactate dehydrogenase and hemoglobin levels.71 The incorporation of surrogate biomarkers into current clinical trials
and practice will require a greater understanding of the molecular and biologic characteristics of advanced prostate
cancer, demonstration of analytic and clinical validation (as
well as clinical utility) of candidate surrogates,72 and,
finally, integration into prospective clinical trials.
Conclusion

The success of the novel AR-directed therapies abiraterone
acetate and enzalutamide has ushered in a new, promising
era in the treatment of advanced prostate cancer. Capitalizing on the finding that retained AR activity is the hallmark of CRPC, additional AR-directed therapies are in
development. However, not all patients derive clinical
benefit from these drugs, and all patients who initially
benefit inevitably acquire resistance and experience disease
progression. The ligand and receptor states in CRPC are
variable, leading to different resistance mechanisms; how
AR-directed therapies further alter disease biology is
under active investigation. Key future directions include
optimizing the sequence and combination of novel therapeutics as well as validating surrogate endpoints to foster
the ongoing development of these drugs—efforts that will
profoundly impact the lives of men with prostate cancer.
