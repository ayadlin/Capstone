Abstract
Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), which is responsible for the
trimethylation of H3K27 (H3K27me3), plays a part in tumorigenesis, development
and/or maintenance of adult tissue specificity. The pivotal role of PRC2 in cancer
makes it a therapeutic target for epigenetic cancer therapy. However, natural
compounds targeting the enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) - embryonic ectoderm
development (EED) interaction to disable PRC2 complex are scarcely reported. Here,
we reported the screening and identification of natural compounds which could disrupt
the EZH2-EED interaction. One of these compounds, wedelolactone, binds to EED with
a high affinity (KD = 2.82 μM), blocks the EZH2-EED interaction in vitro, induces the
degradation of PRC2 core components and modulates the expression of detected PRC2
downstream targets and cancer-related genes. Furthermore, some PRC2-dependent
cancer cells undergone growth arrest upon treatment with wedelolactone. Thus,
wedelolactone and its derivatives which target the EZH2-EED interaction could be
candidates for the treatment of PRC2-dependent cancer.

Introduction

Drosophila melanogaster are responsible for homeotic
gene (Hox) silencing [6]. Further study discovered
a variety of their functions such as participating in
mammalian X-chromosome inactivation and imprinting
[7, 8], maintenance of pluripotency and self-renewal in
embryonic stem cells (ESCs) [9], epigenetic cell cycle
control [10], cell fate decisions and developmental
controls. PcG proteins mainly function by forming two
evolutionarily conserved multimeric protein complexes,
Polycomb repressive complexes 1 (PRC1) and Polycomb
repressive complexes 2 (PRC2). They are involved
in monoubiquitylation of lysine 119 of histone H2A
(H2AK119ub) and di- and tri-methylation of lysine 27
of histone H3 (H3K27me3), respectively [11]. PRC2
contains three essential subunits: a catalytic subunit with

Cancer is a major public health problem in the
world. In the United States, estimated new cancer cases
and cancer deaths in 2014 are 1,665,540 and 585,720,
respectively [1]. Recurrent somatic mutations in
numerous epigenetic regulators in various cancers draw
much attention and highlight the fact that we have now
entered an era of epigenetic cancer therapies [2, 3]. The
epigenomic landscape features different machinery in
transcriptionally active versus silent regions [4]. Polycomb
group (PcG) proteins, conserved chromatin proteins, are
widely deployed in higher eukaryotes to implement gene
silencing [5].

methyltransferase activity, enhancer of zeste homolog
2 (EZH2) and two noncatalytic subunits, suppressor of
zeste 12 (SUZ12) and embryonic ectoderm development
(EED). Much attention is paid to their association with
sorts of cancers like colon cancer, breast cancer, leukemia,
hepatocellular carcinoma and tongue cancer [12-15].
Some groups target PRC2 through inhibiting its core
component EZH2. Lots of EZH2 inhibitors are developed
including 3-deazaneplanocin A (DZNep), EPZ005687 and
GSK126 [16-18]. Others target PRC2 by disrupting the
interaction between EED and EZH2. Interaction between
EED and EZH2, which is essential to PRC2’s HMTase
activity as well as its function [19], serves as an interesting
target for drug development. The N-terminal sequence of
EZH2 (residues 39–68) mediates its association with EED,
among which F42, N45, L56 and V68 are indispensable
[20]. An stabilized a-helix of EZH2 (SAH-EZH2) peptide
derived from this region (contains residues 40–68) was
reported to selectively inhibit H3 Lys27 trimethylation
by disrupting the EZH2–EED complex [21]. However,
natural compounds targeting the EZH2-EED interaction
are scarcely reported.
In this study, we used the Biacore 3000 and
competitive co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) assay to
screen for small-molecule inhibitors which could disturb
the binding of EZH2 to EED from the natural products
library. Two compounds, epigallocatechingallate (EGCG)
and wedelolactone, were identified and further studied.
Interestingly, EGCG has been reported by Subhasree Roy
Choudhury’s group with a function to negatively regulate
PRC2 [22]. In addition to disrupt PRC2, we found that
wedelolactone also induce the degradation of PRC2
core components and modulate the expression of PRC2
targets and cancer-related genes. Moreover, we observed
that wedelolactone could inhibit the proliferation and
migration, induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis of PRC2
dependent cancer cells. Our results provide evidences
that EZH2-EED interaction is a target for the treatment of
PRC2-dependent cancer and wedelolactone is a candidate
for modifications in the future.

response unit (RU) of each compound was collected and
was showed in Figure 1A.
Then,
we
performed
competitive
coimmunoprecipitation (co-IP) experiments to identify
EED-EZH2 disruptors among natural compounds with
RU higher than 50. In these disruptors, we found that 1E7
(EGCG) and 2D7 (wedelolactone) with the concentration
of 5 µM could disrupt the interaction between EZH2 and
EED significantly (Figure 1B). In order to exclude the
potential influence of other proteins in the process, we
translated Myc-EZH2 and Myc-His-EED in vitro using
the reticulocyte lysate system and performed competitive
co-IP assays to investigate the effects of 2D7 on the
interaction between EZH2 and EED. The results showed
that 2D7 blocked the binding of EZH2 to EED efficiently
(Figure 1C), suggesting a direct inhibition of 2D7 on the
association of these two proteins.
As dismantling the PRC2 complex could result in
the decrease of protein stability and further depletion of
PcG members [21], we examined whether wedelolactone
treatment altered the levels of EZH2 and EED. As shown
in Figure 1D, wedelolactone treatment reduced the
protein levels of these two core PRC2 components in
human hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines HepG2, human
monocytic leukemia cells THP1 and human myeloid
leukemia cell lines K562.

SPR detection of EGCG and wedelolactone
binding to EED
Drug candidate is usually expected to bind its target
with a high affinity [23]. Here SPR platform Biacore
3000 was used to monitor the direct interaction between
wedelolactone/EGCG and EED. Fresh recombinant
EED proteins were covalently immobilized on a dextran
sensor chip as ligand before detection. Wedelolactone/
EGCG was serially diluted in a vehicle of 1% DMSO in
PBS buffer and injected as analyte to flow liquid phase.
The sensorgrams had shown direct binding between
wedelolactone (Figure 2A)/EGCG (Figure 2B) and EED
molecule in a dose-dependent manner. Evaluated by BIA
evaluation software, the equilibrium dissociation constant
(KD) value of wedelolactone (2D7)/EGCG (1E7) to EED
is 2.82 μM and 15.1 μM, respectively (Table 2).

To explore the regulation of wedelolactone treatment
on the expression of these PRC2 target genes and cancer
related genes, HepG2, THP1 and K562 cells were treated
with 50 μM wedelolactone for 24 h. Total RNA were
extracted and the mRNA levels of the above genes were
analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR. As shown in
Figure 3A, wedelolactone treatment significantly induces
the expression of GADD45A, DAB2IP, ADRB2, CDKN2A
and p53 while represses Meis1 expression in HepG2
cells. As shown in Figure 3B, wedelolactone significantly
repressed HOXA9 and Meis1 expression while enhances
the expression of GADD45A and p53 in THP1 cells. At
the meantime, the expression of GADD45A, PTEN and
p53 were activated after treatment with wedelolactone in

mediated JNK signaling pathway leading to cell apoptosis
[24]; Beta-2 adrenergic receptor(ADRB2) activation in
xenograft mouse models inhibits prostate cancer tumor
growth in vivo [25]; Loss of CDKN2A contributes to
the loss of control over cell cycle, the bypass of critical
senescent signals and is associated with progression to
malignant disease [26] and GADD45A (growth arrest and
DNA-damage-inducible, alpha) involves in cell cycle and
apoptosis [27].
Dysregulation of EZH2 alters the expression of
many cancer related genes [28, 29]. For instance, targeting
EZH2 could deplete HOXA9 and Meis1 levels in THP1
cells and disrupt the biological synergy between the two
genes in inducing myeloid leukemia [30]. Moreover,
sensitivity of cancer cells to the EZH2 inhibitors is partly

indicated that PRC2 targets and tumor-related genes which
were involved in apoptosis and cell cycle arrest were

invasion [36-38]. Additionally, the migration of K562 and
THP1 cells are scarcely reported. So we interrogated the
effect of wedelolactone on the migration of HepG2 cells.
To determine whether wedelolactone inhibits
cell migration in HepG2 cells, we performed Transwell
migration assays. As shown in Figure 4D, the presence
of wedelolactone significantly suppressed cell migration
in HepG2 cells. Together, our data suggested that
wedelolactone inhibited proliferation, induced apoptosis
and cell cycle arrest and suppressed cell migration of
PRC2-depedent cancer cells.

Wedelolactone inhibits PRC2-dependent cancer
cells
Since human leukemia K562 cells, THP1 monocytes
and hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2 cells are partially
PRC2-dependent [21, 33, 34], we studied the anti-cancer
effect of wedelolactone on these cells.
We first examined the effects of wedelolactone
on cell proliferation. As shown in Figure 4A, 50 μM of
wedelolactone treatment repressed the proliferation of
HepG2, THP1 and K562 cells. Since many drugs have
been shown to inhibit cancer cells through induction of
apoptosis, we then detected the apoptotic ratio in cells
with or without wedelolactone treatment by Annexin
V-FITC/PI double staining assay. As shown in Figure
4B, the presence of wedelolactone significantly increased
apoptosis in HepG2, THP1 and K562 cells.
It is well-known that most anticancer agents, such
as vinblastine and paclitaxel, have been documented
to arrest cell cycle [35]. So we examined the effect of
wedelolatctone on cell cycle distribution of HepG2,
THP1 and K562 cells. Compared with control, there
was an accumulation of cell population in S and G2/M
phase after wedelolactone exposure in HepG2 cells and
the proportion of K562 cells in S phase were increased
after wedelolactone exposure (Figure 4C). However, it
exhibited no significant effect on THP1 cells.
Recently, several studies about EZH2 regulating cell
invasion in various types of cancer showed that one of the
major EZH2 PRC2-dependent function is promoting cell

Discussion
Wedelolactone is an essential active compound
of Eclipta prostrate. It has been reported to possess
various biological functions, including the inhibition
of IKK kinase, K+-ATPase activity, hepatitis virus C
RNA-polymerase, phospholipase A2 , 5-lipoxygenase
and DNA topoisomerase IIα [39]. Also, it exhibits anticancer function in some cancers, such as prostate cancer,
breast cancer and so on [39]. The growth inhibition effects
of wedelolactone on tumor cells were believed to be
accomplished through its inhibition of IKK, the androgen
receptor [40], or topoisomerase II. But its function on the
EED-EZH2 interaction and the PRC2 activity is unknown.
In the present study, we present a new method to
identify inhibitors targeting PRC2. Firstly, Biacore 3000
was used to screen for natural compouds which could
bind to EED. Then the competitive co-IP experiment was
performed to further identify PRC2 disruptors. By this
way, we identified that EGCG and wedelolactone could
bind to EED and target the EZH2-EED interaction.
Tumor suppressors refer to a large group of
molecules that can prevent cancer through controlling cell

division, promoting apoptosis, helping DNA damage repair
and suppressing metastasis [41]. So reactivating tumor
suppressors which are silenced by PRC2 will contribute
to the inhibition of carcinoma cells proliferation. Indeed,
wedelolactone could activate PRC2 downstream tumor
suppression genes such as DAB2IP, ADRB2, CDKN2A
and GADD45A (Figure 3A), thus it serves as a mechanism
for its inhibition on PRC2-dependent cancer cells. In fact,
not all the target genes can be influenced by wedelolactone
(data not shown).
In conclusion, we identified that wedelolactone
could bind to EED and target PRC2, thereby modulate
its targets and cancer-related genes. As a consequence,
wedelolactone exhibits anti-cancer effects by inducing
proliferation and migration inhibition, apoptosis and
cell cycle arrest of PRC2-dependent cancer cells. So it
could serve as a candidate for the treatment of PRC2dependent cancer. Also, our work verified the possibility
to the development of anti-cancer agents by disrupting the
association of core PRC2 components EZH2 and EED.

1% DMSO (v/v) in phosphate buffered saline (PBS).
The dilutions were injected as analyte flow liquid phase
with PBS containing 1% DMSO (v/v) as running buffer
at a constant flow rate of 30 μl/min. Ninety seconds’
association time was set, followed by 180 s dissociation
time. All buffers in the experiment were subjected to be
filtered by 0.22 μm filters and degassed by ultrasonic. The
data were collected by Biacore Control Software (version
4.1.1). Kinetics and affinity parameters were evaluated in
Langmuir model (1:1) by using BIA evaluation software
(version 4.1).

the FACSDiva Version 6.1 Software.

RNA extraction and quantitative reverse
transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRTPCR)

Cell migration assay
HepG2 cells were treated with 25 µm wedelolactone
or DMSO for 12h then the cells were trypsinized and
replated onto the upper chamber of a Transwell filter
with 8 µm pores (Costar) at 2x105 cells/well in serumfree medium. Medium supplemented with 10% FBS
was placed in the bottom well, and the cells were then
incubated for 24 h at 37°C in a humidified 5% CO2
atmosphere. After the incubation, the chambers were
removed, and migration cells on the bottom side of the
membrane were fixed with methanol for 15 min and
stained with gentian violet for 10 min. Each experiment
was performed in triplicate, and the number of cells in five
random fields on the underside of the filter was counted
and averaged. The results were expressed as the migrated
cell number.

Total RNA was isolated from the cells using TRNzol
(TIANGEN, China). cDNA was synthesized using the
RevertAid First Strand cDNA Synthesis kit (Thermo
Scientific, #K1622). Quantitative real-time PCR (qRTPCR) was conducted using SYBR premix Ex Taq II
(Takara, China). Thermal cycling was performed using an
ABI 7300 real-time PCR machine (Applied Biosystems)
as follows: 95°C for 30 s followed by 40 cycles of
amplification for 5 s at 95°C, 31 s at 60°C. The primer
sequences used for PCR are listed in Table 1.

Measurement of cell viability
Cell viability was determined by MTT Cell
Proliferation and Cytotoxicity Detection Kit (KGA312,
KeyGEN BioTECH, China). A total of 5×103 cells were
seeded in 96 well plates. At 48 h post-treatment with
different concentrations of wedelolactone, 1×MTT was
added to the wells and incubated for additional 4 h at
37 °C. The optical density of the dissolved material was
measured at 490 nm.

Statistical analysis
The data are presented as mean ± stand deviation
(S.D.). Parametrical data were compared using Student’s t
test. One-way ANOVA analysis was used to determine the
difference between independent groups. The differences
between the variants were considered to be statistically
significant if P < 0.05.

Cell cycle analysis
The effect of wedelolactone on cell cycle
distribution was determined by flow cytometric analysis.
The cells were treated with 50 μM wedelolactone for 24
h. Appropriate controls were also set up. After treatment,
1×105 floating and adherent cells were collected, washed
with PBS and fixed with 70% ethanol. Staining for DNA
content was performed using Cell Cycle Detection Kit
(KGA512, KeyGEN BioTECH, China). Populations
in G0/G1, S and G2/M phases were measured by BD
FACSCalibur Flow Cytometry System with CellQuest Pro
software (BD Bioscience). Data were analyzed using the
