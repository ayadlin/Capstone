ABSTRACT
A series of pentacyclic tritperpenes found in Perilla frutescens (P. frutescens),
including ursolic acid (UA), oleanolic acid (OA), corosolic acid (CA), 3-epi-corosolic
acid (3-epiCA), maslinic acid (MA), and 3-epi-maslinic acid (3-epiMA) were evaluated
for their effects on epidermal cell signaling, proliferation, and skin inflammation in
relation to their ability to inhibit skin tumor promotion by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol13-acetate (TPA) and compared to UA as the prototype compound. All compounds
were given topically 30 min prior to each TPA application and significantly inhibited
skin tumor promotion. 3-epiCA and MA were significantly more effective than UA at
inhibiting tumor development. All of these compounds significantly inhibited epidermal
proliferation induced by TPA, however, CA, 3-epiCA and MA were more effective
than UA. All compounds also reduced skin inflammation (assessed by infiltration of
mast cells and T-cells) and inflammatory gene expression induced by TPA, however,
3-epiCA and MA were again more effective than UA. The greater ability of 3-epiCA
and MA to inhibit skin tumor promotion was associated with greater reduction of
Cox-2 and Twist1 proteins and inhibition of activation (i.e., phosphorylation) of
IGF-1R, STAT3 and Src. Further study of these compounds, especially 3-epiCA and
MA, for chemopreventive activity in other cancer model systems is warranted.

Various tumor models have been used to evaluate cancer
preventive agents. The multi-stage skin carcinogenesis
model is a well-established model of epithelial
carcinogenesis with distinct and definable stages of tumor
development [4, 5]. This model can be used to evaluate
cancer chemopreventive agents on each individual stage
of the carcinogenesis process and is particularly useful
for identifying potential mechanisms of chemopreventive
action.
Perilla frutescens (P. frutescens) belongs to the
annual mint family and is an edible plant frequently used
in Asian countries including Korea, Japan and China.
It has a pleasant flavor and taste and is used as a food

INTRODUCTION
According to the American Cancer Society, there
will be an estimated 1,658,370 new cancer cases diagnosed
and 588,430 cancer deaths in the US in 2015. In addition,
cancer remains the second most common cause of death
in the US, accounting for nearly 1 of every 4 deaths [1].
In the mid-1970s, Michael Sporn created the term
‘chemoprevention’, which is defined as the use of natural
or synthetic agents to reverse, inhibit or slow the process
of carcinogenesis [2]. Chemoprevention may involve
interruption of the multi-stage carcinogenesis process
during tumor initiation, promotion, and/or progression [3].

ingredient. For example, perilla leaves can be added to
fish, rice, soup, and vegetables and can also be pickled for
many dishes. The perilla leaf extract contains a number
of constituents that have pharmacologic activity, such
as triterpenoids, rosmarinic acid, luteolin, caffeic acid,
apigenin, and beta-carotene [6–8]. These compounds have
various biological activities reported such as anti-oxidant,
hepatoprotective, anti-obesity, and anti-allergic activity
[7, 9–13]. Recently, emerging evidence has shown perilla
extract has anti-inflammatory [7, 8, 14] and anti-cancer
effects [6, 13, 15, 16].
Ursolic acid (UA) is a natural pentacyclic
triterpene compound present in various edible plants
including P. fructescens [17–21]. It has potent cancer
chemopreventive activity and possesses a wide range
of pharmacological activities. UA is widely studied for
its apoptotic, anti-inflammatory, and anti-tumorigenic
properties, including the ability to inhibit skin tumor
promotion in the mouse skin model [8, 21–24]. A number
of mechanisms have been attributed to the ability of UA to
inhibit tumor development in these various model systems.
UA has been shown to suppress multiple cell signaling
pathways including, growth factor receptor activation
(e.g., EGFR), and signaling through IKK/NF-kB, Akt/
mTOR, Cox-2, STAT3, MMP9, and VEGF [20, 21, 25].
In addition, UA has been shown to alter levels of Bax and
caspases and increase the activation of tumor suppressor
proteins such as p53 and AMPK [20, 26].
In addition to UA, a number of other pentacylic
triterpenes including oleanolic acid (OA), corosolic acid
(CA), 3-epi-corosolic acid (3-epiCA), maslinic acid (MA),
3-epi-maslinic acid (3-epiMA), tormentic acid (TA),
pomolic acid (PA), hyptadienic acid (HA), and augustic
acid (AA) are found in P. frutescens [8]. These compounds
are triterpenoid carboxylic acids with molecular formula
C30H48Ox having six isoprene units and are synthesized
in P. frutescens by cyclization of squalene. Banno et al.
have reported that all of these compounds exhibited antiinflammatory effects against TPA-induced ear edema [8].
They also have shown that UA, CA, 3-epiCA, TA, and
3-epiMA have potent inhibitory effects on TPA-induced
Epstein-Barr virus early antigen activation [8]. Of the
compounds found in P. frutescens, only TA, OA and UA,
have previously been evaluated for inhibition of skin
tumor promotion by TPA [8, 22–24].
In the current study, we examined the effect of
7 different triterpenes including UA, OA, AA, CA,
3-epiCA, MA, and 3-epiMA present in P. frutescens on
epidermal proliferation, skin inflammation, inflammatory
gene expression and epidermal signaling pathways induced
by TPA. Six of these compounds were also evaluated for
their ability to inhibit skin tumor promotion by TPA.
Several of the compounds, especially 3-epiCA and MA,
were found to be more effective for inhibition of skin
tumor promotion than UA and are considered excellent

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

candidates for further study of their chemopreventive
effectiveness in other cancer models.

RESULTS
Effect of pentacyclic triterpenes found in
P. frutescens on skin tumor promotion by TPA
To evaluate the anti-tumor promoting effect of
UA and related triterpenes (i.e., OA, CA, 3-epiCA, MA,
and 3-epiMA) present in P. frutescens, a two-stage skin
carcinogenesis experiment was conducted using female
ICR mice. AA was not included in the tumor experiment
due to insufficient amount of this compound for
evaluation. The control group in this experiment that was
initiated with 7, 12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA)
and promoted with TPA had 10.57 papillomas per mouse
(see Figure 1A, Supplemental Figure 1, and Table 1). All
of the pentacylic triterpenes evaluated in this experiment
significantly inhibited skin tumor promotion by TPA.
The topical dose of 2 μmol for each of the triterpenes
was chosen for these experiments based on our recent
study using a similar dose of UA for inhibition of skin
tumor promotion [23]. Pretreatment with UA resulted in
a 42% inhibition of papilloma formation (6.17 papillomas
per mouse; p < 0.05, Mann-Whitney U test) (Table 1).
OA (35% inhibition; 6.87 papillomas per mouse) and
3-epiMA (37% inhibition; 6.7 papillomas per mouse)
also significantly inhibited skin tumor promotion by TPA
(p < 0.05; Mann-Whitney U test), however, these two
compounds were not more effective than UA (p > 0.05,
Mann-Whitney U test). Of the remaining compounds
evaluated, CA significantly inhibited TPA promotion
by 49% (5.38 papillomas per mouse; p < 0.05, MannWhitney U test) when compared to TPA-only group but
this was not significantly different compared to the group
pretreated with UA. On the other hand, both 3-epiCA and
MA inhibited skin tumor promotion by TPA to a greater
extent than UA. In this regard, mice pretreated with
3-epiCA and MA exhibited 4.33 and 3.73 papillomas
per mouse, respectively giving a 59% and 65% inhibition
in tumor multiplicity (p < 0.05; Mann-Whitney U test
compared to the TPA only group and the UA + TPA group,
respectively) (see again Figure 1A and Table 1).
As shown in Figure 1B, the incidence of papillomas
in the group treated with TPA only was 97% at week 25
(Figure 1B and Table 1). Pretreatment with UA, OA,
CA and 3-epiMA did not significantly reduce the overall
incidence of papillomas compared to the TPA-only
treated group (p > 0.05, Fisher’s exact test). However,
pretreatment with 3-epiCA and MA significantly reduced
the overall tumor incidence (67% and 73%, respectively)
and the reduction was statistically significant (p < 0.05,
Fisher’s exact test) when compared to TPA only group or
the UA-pretreated group (both 97% incidence).

7 weeks old (n = 30/group) were initiated with 25 nmol DMBA. Two weeks after initiation with DMBA, mice were pretreated with either
acetone vehicle (0.2 ml), UA (2 μmol), OA (2 μmol), CA (2 μmol), 3-epiCA (2 μmol), MA (2 μmol) and 3-epiMA (2 μmol) 30 min prior
to each 6.8 nmol TPA treatment. All treatments were given twice-weekly. The number and incidence of papillomas as well as average

No significant difference was observed in body weight between triterpenes-untreated group and triterpenes-treated groups. **p ≤ 0.05

multiplicity and body weight. For tumor incidence, Fisher’s exact test was used. Statistical analysis of tumor latency (i.e., tumor free
survival) was performed using the Mantel-Cox test.

As shown in Figure 1C, tumor latency was also
significantly affected by pretreatment with the various
triterpenes. In this regard, pretreatment with UA, OA,
CA, 3-epiCA, 3epiMA and MA significantly delayed
tumor development when compared to TPA-only treated
group (p < 0.05; Mantel-Cox test). Notably, a greater
increase in tumor latency was observed in the groups of
mice pretreated with 3-epiCA or MA compared to the
UA-pretreated group (p < 0.05; Mantel-Cox test).
In summary, all of the triterpene compounds tested
in this experiment significantly inhibited skin tumor

promotion by TPA. UA, along with OA, CA, 3-epiCA,
MA, and 3-epiMA, effectively inhibited the formation
of papillomas promoted by TPA. Notably, 3-epiCA
and MA exhibited the greatest inhibitory effect on
papilloma multiplicity, incidence, and latency and these
two compounds were significantly more effective at
inhibiting skin tumor promotion when compared to the
UA-pretreated group. As shown in Figure 1D, there were
no significant differences in body weight between any of
the triterpene-treated groups and the TPA-only treated
group (p > 0.05, Mann-Whitney U test). In addition,

there were no signs of epidermal toxicity in mice treated

was first evaluated by examining effects on the dermal
infiltration of inflammatory cells (i.e., mast cells and CD3
positive T-lymphocytes). As shown in Figure 3A and 3B,
all compounds significantly reduced the number of mast
cells (toluidine blue O-stained cells) in the dermis in the
range from 40–62% (p < 0.05; Mann-Whitney U test)
compared to the TPA only treated group. Again, 3-epiCA
and MA were the most effective at reducing the number
of infiltrated mast cells and showed a significantly greater
inhibitory effect compared to the UA-pretreated group
(p < 0.05, Mann-Whitney U test). Similar results were
also observed for the number of infiltrated T-lymphocytes
(CD3 positive cells) induced by TPA where all of the
triterpenes significantly reduced their number compared
to the TPA-only group (p < 0.05, Mann-Whitney U test)
(Figure 3C and 3D). Again, 3-epiCA and MA were the most
effective compounds at inhibiting dermal T-cell infiltration
induced by treatment with TPA when compared to UA
(p < 0.05; Mann-Whitney U test).

Effect of UA and related triterpenes found
in P. frutescens on TPA-induced epidermal
hyperproliferation
Since epidermal proliferation is important for
skin tumor development during tumor promotion in the
two-stage skin carcinogenesis model [4, 5], histologic
analyses were conducted to determine the effects of UA
and the other triterpenes on TPA-induced epidermal
hyperplasia (epidermal thickness) and labeling index
(LI). The short-term treatment protocol was used for
these experiments. As shown in Figure 2A and 2B,
TPA treatment increased both epidermal thickness and
LI 48 h after the last treatment when compared to vehicle
(acetone)-treated group (p < 0.05; Mann-Whitney U test).
Pretreatment with all of the triterpenes reduced both
epidermal thickness and LI compared to the TPA-only
treated group (p < 0.05, Mann-Whitney U test). However,
3-epiCA, MA and 3-epiMA inhibited epidermal thickness
to a greater extent than UA and CA, 3-epiCA, and MA
also reduced the LI to a greater extent than UA (p < 0.05;
Mann-Whitney U test). Overall, these data indicate that
all compounds examined in this experiment effectively
inhibited TPA-induced epidermal hyperproliferation with
several compounds, especially 3-epiCA and MA more
effective than UA.

Effect of triterpenes on TPA-induced
inflammatory gene expression
As shown in Figure 4, qRT-PCR analyses showed
that UA and the other related triterpenes inhibited TPAinduced inflammatory gene expression in the epidermis.
In this regard, mRNA levels of the following genes were
evaluated: Cox-2, Il17a, Il22, Cxcl1, Cxcl2, and Vegfa.
The increased expression of Cox-2 mRNA following
TPA treatment was significantly reduced by pretreatment
with UA, OA, CA, 3-epiCA and MA (p < 0.05; MannWhitney U test) (Figure 4). MA pretreatment led to the
greatest reduction in Cox-2 mRNA and this reduction
was greater than that observed in the UA pretreated
group (p < 0.05; Mann-Whitney U test). Furthermore,
the induction of Vegfa by TPA was lowered significantly
by pretreatment with AA, CA, 3-epiCA, and MA

Effect of triterepenes on epidermal signaling
pathways induced by TPA

UA and 3-epiMA did not show a statistically significant
decrease in the expression of Il22 induced by TPA.
Again, 3-epiCA and MA produced the greatest inhibition
of Il22 expression.
We also investigated the effects of the triterpenes
on proinflammatory chemokines, Cxcl1 and Cxcl2. As
shown in Figure 4, the expression Cxcl1 and Cxcl2 was
significantly increased by TPA treatment (p < 0.05; MannWhitney U test). Pretreatment with CA, 3-epiCA, and
MA inhibited Cxcl1 mRNA induction. In addition, all of
the compounds significantly inhibited the expression of
Cxcl2 by TPA (p < 0.05; Mann-Whitney U test). Notably,
3-epiCA and MA, were most effective and produced
greater inhibition than UA on Cxcl2 mRNA expression
(p < 0.05, Mann-Whitney U test).
Collectively, these data demonstrate that UA
and related triterpenes found in P. frutescens inhibited
inflammatory gene expression in the epidermis, although
some of these genes were differentially affected by the
individual triterpenes. Notably, when looking at all the
genes examined, 3-epiCA and MA produced the most
significant effects on the largest number of inflammatory
genes induced by TPA.

The effects of topical pretreatment with UA, OA,
AA, CA, 3-epiCA, MA and 3-epiMA on multiple signaling
pathways induced by TPA in the epidermis were examined
at a 6 hr time point (see Figure 5, panels A and B). As
shown in Figure 5A and 5B, groups pretreated with UA,
OA, AA, CA, or 3-epiMA showed a slight inhibition of
phosphorylation of IGF-1βRY1135/1136 (not statistically
significant). However, a statistically significant inhibition
was observed in the groups pretreated with 3-epiCA
and MA. The inhibitory effect of 3-epiCA on activation of
IGF-1βRY1135/1136 by TPA treatment was also significantly
greater when compared to the UA-pretreated group
(p < 0.05; Mann-Whitney U test). On the other hand,
none of the triterpene compounds showed inhibition of
TPA-induced p-EGFRY1086 levels. Evaluation of the effect
of the triterpenes on p-SrcY416 levels was also examined.
Significant inhibition of the phosphorylation of p-SrcY416
was observed in groups pretreated with CA, 3-epiCA, MA
and 3-epiMA (p < 0.05; Mann-Whitney U test). Again,
similar to the result of IGF-1βR signaling, 3-epiCA

was more effective at reducing p-SrcY416 levels than UA

The inhibitory effect of the triterpenes was also
examined on STAT3 phosphorylation (both the Y705
and the S727 sites) induced by TPA (Figure 5A and 5B).
As shown in the figure, CA, 3-epiCA, MA and 3-epiMA
significantly decreased the phosphorylation of STAT3 at
S727 (p < 0.05; Mann-Whitney U test) while rest of the
compounds tested did not show a statistically significant
reduction in p-STAT3S727 level when compared to
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

the TPA-only treated group. Notably, 3-epiCA, MA,
and 3-epiMA showed the greatest inhibitory effect
(p < 0.05; Mann-Whitney U test). In addition, 3-epiCA
and MA significantly inhibited the phosphorylation of
p-STAT3Y705 (p < 0.05; Mann-Whitney U test) while
the other compounds did not significantly alter STAT3
phosphorylation at this site. A downstream target of
STAT3, Twist1, was also examined. Pretreatment with
CA, 3-epiCA, MA, and 3-epiMA reduced the level
of Twist1 induced by TPA (p < 0.05; Mann-Whitney
U test).

DISCUSSION

Additional analyses were performed to examine
the effect of the triterpenes on other signaling pathways
such as Cox-2, JNK1/2, c-Jun, Pdcd4 and p27. As
shown in Figure 5A and 5B, the level of Cox-2 protein
was significantly reduced by all of the compounds
except AA and the reduction by 3-epiCA and MA was
greater than that observed in the UA-pretreated group
(p < 0.05; Mann-Whitney U test). In addition, all
triterpenes excluding OA  significantly reduced the
phosphorylation of JNK1/2T183/Y185 that was stimulated
by TPA treatment (p < 0.05; Mann-Whitney U test), and
AA, CA, 3-epiCA, MA and 3-epiMA had a significant
inhibitory effect on TPA-induced c-Jun phosphorylation
at S73. Notably, a greater reduction in p-c-JunS73 was
observed in the groups pretreated with CA, 3-epiCA, and
3-epiMA (p < 0.05; Mann-Whitney U test) compared with
the UA-pretreated group. The effect of the pentacyclic
triterpenes on tumor suppressor proteins, Pdcd4 and p27,
was investigated. The decreased level of Pdcd4 after TPA
treatment was partially reversed by CA, 3-epiCA, MA
and 3-epiMA (p < 0.05; Mann-Whitney U test) whereas
none of compounds had significant effects on p27 levels
following treatment with TPA.
Several studies including those from our group
have reported AMPK activators (e.g. Metformin,
AICAR, compound C) inhibit skin cancer in vitro and
in vivo [27–29], therefore the effect of the triterpenes
on AMPK signaling following TPA treatment was also
evaluated. As shown in Figure 5A and 5B, TPA treatment
induced a modest activation of AMPK (assessed by
phosphorylation at T172). Pretreatment with UA did not
significantly increase AMPK activation while pretreatment
with the other compounds tested significantly increased
the phosphorylation of AMPK-αT172 above that observed
following TPA treatment (p < 0.05; Mann-Whitney
U test). The status of SirT1 and LKB1 was also evaluated.
As shown in Figure 5A and 5B, activation of LKB1
(phosphorylation at S428) was enhanced by pretreatment
with CA, 3-epiCA, MA and 3-epiMA (p < 0.05; MannWhitney U test) while all triterpene compounds except
UA significantly increased the level of SirT1 (p < 0.05,
Mann-Whitney U test). As expected, phosphorylation of
the downstream target of AMPK, Ulk1 at S555 was also
elevated by pretreatment with AA, CA, 3-epiCA, MA and
3-epiMA. Notably, the dramatic upregulation as seen in
AMPK signaling after 3-epiMA pretreatment was also
observed in the phosphorylation of Ulk1 at S555 after
pretreatment with this compound.
In summary, the data in Figure 5 demonstrate
that pretreatment with the various triterpenes that were
evaluated caused alterations in a number of signaling
pathways important for skin tumor promotion by TPA.
Several of the compounds, including 3-epiCA and MA
showed greater effects on a broad range of signaling
pathways that may have contributed to their greater ability
to inhibit skin tumor promotion by TPA.

In the current study, all of the triterpenes tested
significantly inhibited skin tumor promotion by TPA.
3-EpiCA and MA were the most effective compounds at
inhibiting the development of papillomas and were more
effective than the prototype and more widely studied UA.
Mechanistic studies revealed that all of the tripterpenes
tested had the ability to inhibit TPA-induced epidermal
hyperproliferation and skin inflammation. Again, the
overall inhibitory effects on epidermal proliferation
and skin inflammation were the greatest in the groups
pretreated with 3-epiCA or MA and significantly greater
than seen in the UA + TPA group. Analysis of epidermal
signaling pathways induced by TPA revealed that there
were variable effects of the different compounds on
individual signaling pathways. However, the greater
ability of 3-epiCA and MA to inhibit skin tumor promotion
was associated with greater reduction of Cox-2 and Twist1
proteins and inhibition of activation (i.e., phosphorylation)
of IGF-1R, STAT3 and Src. Collectively, the current data
demonstrate that triterpenes from P. frutescens inhibit
skin tumor promotion by inhibiting signaling pathways
associated with epidermal proliferation and inflammation.
Several of the pentacyclic triterpenes found in
P. frutescens have been widely studied. In this regard, UA
has been shown to have apoptotic, anti-inflammatory, and
anti-tumorigenic effects [18, 20, 25, 30]. UA and OA are
often found together in plants, including P. frutescens,
and possess similar pharmacological properties [18, 20,
21, 30]. OA, like UA, also exhibits anti-inflammatory,
gastro-protective, wound-healing, and anti-microbial
properties [31, 32]. In addition, several studies have
shown its anti-cancer effects in both in vitro and in vivo
models [22, 33]. OA inhibits proliferation and induces
apoptosis in many cancer cell lines including breast,
lung, and skin [34–37]. CA also exists in abundance in
the plant kingdom, including bananas and loquat as
well as P. frutescens [8, 38]. A number of studies have
shown that CA has anti-diabetic, anti-oxidant, antiinflammatory, apoptotic, and anti-cancer activities. Its
anti-cancer effects have not been as extensively studied
in vivo although several in vitro studies have demonstrated
growth inhibitory effects in cancer cell lines including
gastric, colon, cervix, leukemia and lung [39–45]. MA,
also known as crategolic acid, has been isolated from
P. frutescens as well as other edible plants such as olive
fruit, spinach, eggplant, mustard, basil and legumes [46].
Recently, the anti-proliferative and apoptotic properties of
MA have been demonstrated in various cancer cell lines
such as colon, liver, bladder, uterus and breast [19, 47–51].
As noted in the Introduction, of the compounds
evaluated in the current study, only UA and OA have
previously been shown to inhibit skin tumor promotion by
TPA [17, 22–24]. In a recent study by our group, topical
pretreatment with 2 μmol of UA reduced the number of
39300

Oncotarget

TPA promoted skin papillomas by 39% [23]. In the current
study, the same dose of UA given before TPA reduced
papilloma formation by 42%. Thus, these two independent
studies show that UA, when given topically to the same
mice (female ICR) and under similar experimental
conditions, produced essentially the same level of
inhibition of tumor promotion. Tokuda et al. reported that
topical application of OA inhibited skin tumor promotion
by TPA in female ICR mice using considerably lower
doses [22]. In this study, they also compared the antitumor promoting effect of OA with UA using two different
treatment protocols. Both OA and UA inhibited skin tumor
promotion by TPA to a similar extent when the compounds
were given prior to each TPA application over a 20 week
period. Surprisingly, both compounds also were shown
to inhibit skin tumor development when given only once
prior to the first TPA application. The mechanisms for the
observed inhibition of skin tumor promotion by both OA
and UA in either protocol were not reported in this earlier
study. In the current study, UA and OA given at the same
topical dose produced a very similar inhibition of skin
tumor promotion (42% vs 35%, respectively; Table 1).
The potential anti-cancer effects of CA and MA have
been reported in a number of in vitro studies, however,
only a few studies have evaluated their inhibitory effects
in cancer models. Li et al. reported that subcutaneous
administration of MA (10 and 50 mg/kg) inhibited growth
of pancreatic cancer cells in a xenograft mouse model [52].
In another study, MA was given in the diet (100 mg/kg)
to APC Min/+ mice and was shown to reduce colon
carcinogenesis by 45% [53]. In addition, MA inhibited
both the size and weight of bladder tumors in a xenograft
mouse model [50]. Recently, Yoo et al. have reported
that CA possess suppressive effects on angiogenesis and
lymphangiogenesis in vivo using a CT-26 colon carcinoma
animal model [54].
In contrast to UA and OA, no studies to date have
reported on the anti-skin tumor promoting effects of CA,
3-epiCA, MA and 3-epiMA. Therefore, our results report
for the first time the ability of these triterpenoids that
are found together in P. frustesens to inhibit skin tumor
promotion by TPA in the two-stage skin carcinogenesis
model. As shown in Figure 1 and Table 1, all four of
these compounds had the ability to inhibit skin tumor
promotion by TPA when given topically 30 min prior
to each TPA application. This was seen primarily in the
ability to inhibit the formation of papillomas that were
promoted by TPA. Significant effects were also observed
on tumor latency. When compared to the activity of UA
for inhibition of skin tumor promotion, two compounds
(i.e., 3-epiCA and MA) exhibited greater ability to inhibit
skin tumor promotion as assessed by effects on tumor
multiplicity, tumor incidence, and tumor free survival
(i.e., latency) (see again Figure 1 and Table 1). Although
we did not examine the effect of the triterpene compounds
on the development of squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs),
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

papillomas are considered premalignant tumors [4, 5], and
we have previously shown that reductions in the number
of papillomas leads to decreases in the number of SCCs
[4, 27, 55].
In our previous study, topical application of 2 μmol
UA prior to TPA application was shown to significantly
inhibit Cox-2, p-NF-κB p65S536, and p-AktT308 signaling as
well as reduce phosphorylation of p-SrcY416, p-STAT3Y705,
and p-JNK1/2T183/Y185 [23]. In the current study, the
effect of 2 μmol of UA, OA, AA, CA, 3-epiCA, MA,
and 3-epiMA were compared for their effects on some
of these same pathways as well as others (Figure 5). All
compounds reduced Cox-2 expression and the level of
p-JNK1/2T183/Y185, although the reduction in Cox-2 level
with AA pretreatment was not statistically significant.
In addition, all of the compounds reduced the levels of
p-c-SrcY416, although the values with UA, OA and AA
were not statistically significant. Some of the triterpenes,
notably, 3-epiCA and MA produced a greater degree and a
broader range of inhibition of signaling pathways. Further
analyses revealed that these two compounds, in addition
to inhibiting Cox-2, p-JNK1/2T183/Y185 and p-SrcY416,
significantly reduced p-IGF-1RY1135/1136, p-Stat3S727, Twist1,
p-c-JunS73 and increased Pdcd4, p-AMPK-αT172, Sirt1,
p-LKB1S428 and p-ULK1S555. Thus, the greater inhibitory
activity of these two compounds was associated with a
greater ability to modulate multiple growth factor and
inflammatory signaling pathways in the epidermis.
During the tumor promotion stage, repeated topical
treatments of TPA produce and maintain chronic epidermal
cell proliferation [5]. Initiated cells have a selective growth
advantage during TPA induced epidermal hyperplasia
and proliferation, and undergo clonal expansion to form
pre-malignant papillomas [4, 5, 56]. Therefore, we
examined the anti-proliferative effect of the triterpenes on
TPA-induced epidermal hyperproliferation. Our previous
data indicated that topical treatment of UA inhibited
both epidermal thickness and LI induced by TPA [23].
In the current study, UA and the other related triterpenes
significantly inhibited TPA-induced epidermal thickness
and LI. However, 3-epiCA and MA, again showed the
greatest effect on epidermal hyperproliferation, and
these two compounds were more effective than the group
pretreated with UA.
Another important aspect of tumor promotion is
chronic inflammation. Upregulation and secretion of
pro-inflammatory molecules by TPA treatment recruits
inflammatory cells such as mast cells, monocytes,
leukocytes, T-and B-lymphocytes, and macrophages into
the dermis [57, 58]. The number of these cells is increased
in the dermis adjacent to the epidermis, and they promote
tumor growth by producing growth factors, cytokines,
and chemokines [57, 58]. Data previously published from
our group suggested that multiple applications of TPA
increased the number of dermal infiltrated inflammatory
cells such as mast cells, T-lymphocytes, and macrophages
39301

Oncotarget

in mouse skin [23, 59]. Topical treatment with UA and
other chemopreventive agents such as rapamycin and
resveratrol, have been shown to decrease the number of
these cells in the dermis following TPA treatment [23, 59].
In addition, Banno et al. demonstrated the antiinflammatory effect of UA and some other triterpenes
including OA, AA, CA, 3-epiCA, CA, MA and 3-epiMA
on TPA-induced ear edema [8, 60]. In this study, they
determined ID50 values of triterpenoids and the range
of ID50 on TPA-induced inflammation in mouse ear was
from 0.09 to 0.15 mg/ear, showing that no dramatic
difference of ID50 was observed among the groups
pretreated with UA, AA, CA, 3-epiCA, MA or 3-epiMA
dissolved in MeOH-CHCl3-H2O vehicle. However, given
the higher ID50 value (0.3 mg/ear) of OA, OA was less
effective than the others. As shown in Figure 3, UA and
related triterpenes significantly decreased the number of
dermal mast cells and T-lymphocytes induced by TPA.
Again, the most effective compounds were 3-epiCA and
MA. In addition, these two compounds were the most
effective overall at inhibiting TPA-induced inflammatory
gene expression (Figure 4).
In conclusion, evaluation of a series of pentacyclic
triterpenes found in P. frutescens showed that all of these
compounds inhibited skin tumor promotion by TPA and
that 3-epiCA and MA were more effective than UA. The
inhibitory effects of all compounds and the greater effect
of several compounds such as 3-epiCA and MA on skin
tumor promotion were due to the reduction of epidermal
hyperproliferation, skin inflammation, and alterations in
a number of epidermal signaling pathways critical for
tumor promotion. Although some of these compounds
were previously shown to have anti skin tumor promoting
activity (UA and OA), this is the first comprehensive
comparison of a series of pentacyclic triterpenes found
in P. frutescens for their effects on skin tumor promotion
in vivo and included new compounds not previously
evaluated (i.e., CA, 3-epiCA MA and 3-epiMA).
Furthermore, we found that two of these compounds
were more active than UA and have provided a potential
mechanistic basis for this increased activity. Overall, these
compounds and especially 3-epiCA and MA, deserve
further evaluation for their cancer chemopreventive
activity.

All animal experiments were performed according to both
Institutional as well as NIH guidelines under an approved
IACUC protocol.

Chemicals
UA and OA were purchased from Sabinsa Company
(East Windsor, NJ) and Stanford Chemicals (Irvine,
CA), respectively. AA, CA, MA, 3-epiCA, and 3-epiMA
were prepared as recently described by us [61]. All
triterpenes used in the current experiments were > 98%
pure. Chemical agents including DMBA and 5-Bromo2′-deoxyurine (BrdU) were purchased from Sigma
Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO), and TPA was purchased
from LC laboratories (Woburn, MA).

Two-stage skin carcinogenesis assays
Female ICR mice (n = 30/group) 7–8 weeks of
age were shaved on the dorsal skin and then initiated
48 hrs later with a single topical application of 25 nmol
of DMBA in 0.2 ml acetone or 0.2 ml acetone vehicle.
During tumor promotion (begun 2 weeks after initiation),
mice received 2 μmol of UA, OA, CA, 3-epiCA, MA or
3-epiMA 30 min prior to each 6.8 nmol TPA application.
TPA was administered twice-weekly for the duration
of the experiment until the number of papillomas
per mouse reached a plateau (25 weeks). Body weight,
tumor incidence (percentage of mice with papillomas),
and tumor multiplicity (average number of papillomas
per mouse) were measured once a week for the duration
of the experiment. In addition, the surface area of all
detectable papillomas was measured by digital calipers at
the termination of the experiment.

Short-term treatment protocol
Female ICR female mice (7–8 weeks old) were
shaved on the dorsal skin and two days later received
topical treatments with acetone vehicle (200 μl) or 2 μmol
of UA, OA, AA, CA, 3-epiCA, MA, or 3-epiMA 30 min
before 6.8 nmol TPA treatment. All treatments were given
twice weekly for two weeks. Epidermal tissue was then
harvested 6 hrs after (for Western blot analysis and qRTPCR) or 48 hrs after (for histologic evaluation) the last
TPA treatment.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Histologic analyses

Animals and diets

For histologic evaluation of epidermal thickness,
LI, and the number of dermal infiltrated inflammatory
cells, groups of mice (n = 4 mice/group) were treated
with the triterpene compounds according to the shortterm protocol regimen. BrdU (100 μg/g B.W.) dissolved
in PBS was injected i.p. to mice 30 min prior to sacrifice.
Forty-eight hrs after the last TPA treatment, dorsal skin
was excised and fixed in 10% neutral-buffered formalin.

We purchased Female ICR (CD-1) 6–7 weeks of
age from Harlan Laboratories Inc. (Houston, TX). Mice
were group housed (n = 4~5 / cage) for all experiments.
For the short-term experiments, mice were maintained
on a regular chow diet. Mice received a semi-purified
diet containing 10 kcal% fat (D12450B, Research
Diets Inc., New Brunswick, NJ) for tumor experiments.

The fixed skin samples were embedded in paraffin,
sectioned (4  μm) and stained with toluidine blue O
(Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA), anti-BrdU (Abcam,
Cambridge, MA), or anti-CD3 (Cell Signaling Technology,
Beverly, MA). Epidermal thickness and LI were
determined as described previously [62]. The number of
inflammatory cells in the dermis was counted per 200 mm2
field as previously described [59].

Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kits (Applied
Biosystems, Grand Island, NY), 1 μg of RNA was mixed
with 2 μl 10X RT buffer, 2 μl 10X random primers, 0.8 μl
25X dNTP mix (100 mM), 1 μl reverse transcriptase and
RNase-free water in a total 20 μl volume. The mixtures
were incubated at in the order of 25°C for 10 min, 37°C
for 120 min, 85°C for 5 min, and 4°C for 5 min. For qRTPCR analysis, cDNA (150 ng) was mixed with 5 μl of
2X iTag™ universal SYBR green supermix (Bio-Rad,
Hercules, CA), 0.5 μl of 10 μM forward primers, 0.5 μl
of 10 μM reverse primers, and RNase-free water in a total
10 μl volume. The mixtures were then subjected to qRTPCR using a ViiA™ 7 (Applied Biosystems, Grand Island,
NY) real time instrument and analysis software.

Collection of epidermal tissue and preparation of
epidermal protein lysates and total RNA
For the preparation of epidermal protein lysates and
total RNA, groups of mice (n = 4 mice per group) received
pretreatment with acetone or triterpene compounds before
TPA treatment according to the short-term treatment
protocol. Mice were sacrificed 6 hrs after the last TPA
treatment and epidermal protein lysates were collected as
previously described [59]. Epidermal RNA samples were
isolated using an RNreasy mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia,
CA) as previously described [63, 64] and subjected for
quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis.

Statistical analysis
The statistical evaluation of significant differences
between groups was performed using the Mann-Whitney
U test for the following data; protein expression, gene
expression, epidermal thickness, labeling index, the
number of dermal infiltrated inflammatory cells, tumor
multiplicity, and body weight. A one-tailed Fisher’s
exact test was used for comparison of tumor incidence.
The Mantel-Cox test was used for comparisons of tumor
latency. Significance in all cases was set at p ≤ 0.05.

Western blot analysis
For Western blot analyses, the protein concentration
of the supernatant was measured using the lowry
protein assay kit (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA).
Aliquots of supernatant containing 30 μg protein were
boiled in sodium dodecylsulfate (SDS) sample loading
buffer for 5 min before electrophoresis on 6–15%
SDS-polyacrylamide gel and then transferred to the
nitrocellulose membrane. The blots were blocked with
5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) or 5% non-fat dry milk
in TBST buffer [TBS containing 0.1% Tween-20] for 1 hr
at room temperature. The membranes were incubated
overnight at 4°C with 1:1000 dilutions of primary
antibodies. Blots were washed three times with TBST
at 10 min interval followed by incubation with 1:5000
horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies
(rabbit or mouse) for 1 hr and washed in TBST for three
times. The transferred proteins were visualized with an
ECL detection kit (Thermo Scientific, Waltham,  MA)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Antibodies
against the following proteins were used: IGF-1βR,
p-IGF-1βRY1135/1136, p-Src Y416, p-JNK1/2T183/Y185, JNK1/2,
p-c-JunS73, c-Jun, Pdcd4, p-AMPK-αT172, AMPK-α, SirT1,
p-LKB1S416, p-Ulk1S555, Ulk1, STAT3, p-STAT3S727,
pSTAT3Y705 (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly,
MA); p-EGFRY1086 (Abcam, Cambridge, MA); EGFR
(Millipore); p27 (BD Biosciences, Bradford, MA); twist1
and actin (Sigma. St. Louis, MO).
