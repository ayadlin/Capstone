Aptamer-Mediated Blockade of IL4Ra Triggers Apoptosis
of MDSCs and Limits Tumor Progression

Abstract
In addition to promoting tumor progression and metastasis by enhancing angiogenesis and invasion, myeloidderived suppressor cells (MDSC) and tumor-associated macrophage (TAM) also inhibit antitumor T-cell
functions and limit the efﬁcacy of immunotherapeutic interventions. Despite the importance of these leukocyte
populations, a simple method for their speciﬁc depletion has not been developed. In this study, we generated an
RNA aptamer that blocks the murine or human IL-4 receptor-a (IL4Ra or CD124) that is critical for MDSC
suppression function. In tumor-bearing mice, this anti–IL4Ra aptamer preferentially targeted MDSCs and TAM
and unexpectedly promoted their elimination, an effect that was associated with an increased number of tumorinﬁltrating T cells and a reduction in tumor growth. Mechanistic investigations of aptamer-triggered apoptosis in
MDSCs conﬁrmed the importance of IL4Ra–STAT6 pathway activation in MDSC survival. Our ﬁndings deﬁne a
straightforward strategy to deplete MDSCs and TAMs in vivo, and they strengthen the concept that IL4Ra
signaling is pivotal for MDSC survival. More broadly, these ﬁndings suggest therapeutic strategies based on
IL4Ra signaling blockades to arrest an important cellular mechanism of tumoral immune escape mediated by
MDSCs and TAM in cancer. Cancer Res; 72(6); 1373–83. 2012 AACR.

Introduction
Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC, CD11bþGr1þ
IL4Raþ (1, 2) and tumor-associated macrophages (TAM,
CD11bþGr1F4/80þ; ref. 3) are particularly important in promoting tumor growth metastasis and angiogenesis (4, 5) and in
suppressing the antitumor immune response (6). Although
different signaling pathways may be responsible for the MDSC
suppressive activity, the IL4Ra–STAT6 pathway seems to be
particularly important: it mediates TGF-b production (7),
arginase activity (8) and, in conjunction with STAT3 and
STAT1 activation, it allows for the production of peroxynitrite
and ROS (6) and for the expression of matrix metalloproteinase
9 (9).
Although different compounds were shown to inhibit or
deplete MDSCs (i.e., STAT3 or PDE5 inhibitors, vitamin D,
ATRA, nitroaspirin gemcitabine, and others; ref. 10) and

showed reasonable rates of success, their systemic use leads
to undesirable side effects and off-target depletion.
Selective targeting of MDSCs is therefore necessary to
maximize the efﬁcacy of immune therapeutic approaches
while minimizing systemic side effects. To this aim, we
selected a new RNA aptamer that speciﬁcally targets IL4Ra
because of the importance of this receptor in MDSC suppressive function. RNA aptamers are nanomolecules that
can recognize their targets with extremely high afﬁnity.
This class of compounds provides unique advantages as
therapeutic agents, such as amenability to chemical modiﬁcations, ease of production, and low immunogenicity
(11, 12).
Here we describe a new RNA aptamer speciﬁc for IL4Ra/
CD124. This aptamer selectively targets MDSCs and TAM in
vivo, blocks IL4Ra signaling, induces MDSCs apoptosis,
and signiﬁcantly delays tumor progression in 4T1-bearing
mice.

Material and used in vitro at 150 nmol/L unless otherwise
speciﬁed.
Mice
All animal experiments were approved by the Division of
Veterinary Resources and the Institutional Animal Care &
Use Committee (IACUC) of the University of Miami. BALB/c
mice were purchased from Harlan Laboratories whereas
IL4Ra/mice were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory.
All experiments were conducted on 6- to 10-week-old mice
in pathogen-free facilities.
Aptamer treatment of tumor-bearing mice
Mice were injected subcutaneously with either 500,000
tumor cell. Starting on day 3 after challenge and every other
day thereafter, mice received intravenous injections of either
IL4Ra (16 pmoles/grams) or an unrelated aptamer in PBS.
Tumor growth was evaluated 3 times a week. Data are
expressed as tumor size index that is the product of the main
diameter with the perpendicular one.

Results
IL4Ra is a functional marker that deﬁnes the suppressive
MDSCs population in the 4T1 mammary carcinoma
We have previously shown that IL4Ra (CD124) is upregulated in many murine tumors and that it plays a key role in
MDSCs suppressive function in the mouse CT26 colon carcinoma (2) and A20 lymphoma (15). However it is necessary to
determine the importance of a putative functional marker in
any model used. To this aim, different population of MDSCs
were isolated from IL4Raþ/þ or IL4RaKOBalb/c mice bearing
the 4T1 mammary carcinoma. Mice were sacriﬁced at day
16, splenic CD11bþMDSCs were magnetically enriched
(Fig. 1A and B) and MDSCs populations (CD11bþIL4Raþ,
CD11bþIL4Ra, total CD11bþcells or CD11bþIL4RaKO) were
sorted by FACS and the suppressive activity of each population
was tested against CFSE-labeled HA-speciﬁc CD8þT cells.
CD11bþMDSCs drastically inhibit T cells proliferation allowing
only half of the clonotypic population to divide (Fig. 1C).

Flow cytometry
Antibodies used are described in the Supplementary
Material. Dead cells were excluded by the analysis by using
the yellow-DEAD/LIVE dye (Invitrogen) or 40 ,6-diamidino2-phenylindole (DAPI; Sigma). Manufacturer's instructions
were used for Annexin V–APC/7AAD and PhosphoSTAT6
staining (BD-Pharmingen). Samples were read on LSR-Fortessa-HTR ﬂow cytometer (Becton-Dickinson) or an LSR2
(equipped with the 532 laser to excite the Cy3 ﬂuorochrome). Data were analyzed using FCS3 express software
(Denovo-Software). Proliferation analysis was done using
FCS4 professional software (Denovo-Software).
Tumor immunoﬂuorescent analysis
Specimens were ﬁxed with 10% formalin and embedded in
parafﬁn and stained using standard immune ﬂuorescence
methods described in the Supplementary Methods.
Suppressive assays
A total of 105 MDSCs were plated in a 96-well ﬂat bottom
plate with 105 CFSE-labeled HA-speciﬁc CD8þT cells puriﬁed
by negative selection from the splenocytes of TCRcl4 mice
(Jackson laboratories). A total of 106 Thy1.2þ/þBalb/c splenocytes were added as feeders and T cells were stimulated with
the relevant or an irrelevant peptide. Three days later, clonotypic T-cell proliferation was evaluated by ﬂuorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) after staining with anti-CD8 and antiThy1.1 antibodies.
Statistical analysis
Sigma plot was used for statistical analysis. One-way ANOVA
or ANOVA on RANKs was done after normality evaluation by
Kolmogorov–Smirnov test. Pairwise post-hoc analysis was
carried out using the Holm-Sidak's or the Dunn's test. Student
t test was used when 2 groups were analyzed. Kaplan–Meier
log-rank followed by the Holm–Sidak post-hoc analysis was
used to evaluate the survival differences between groups.

IL4Ra Blockade Induces MDSCs Apoptosis

Similar results are obtained with CD11bþIL4Raþ cells but not
with CD11bþIL4Ra nor with CD11bþIL4RaKO cells (Fig. 1C
and D). CD11bþ and CD11bþIL4Raþ cells reduced also the
proliferative capacity of the dividing cells, as shown by the
reduced proliferative index, whereas no inhibition was seen
when CD11bþIL4Ra or CD11bþIL4RaKO cells were used.
These data indicated that CD124 expression (together with
CD11b) not only identiﬁes the MDSCs suppressive subpopulation in the 4T1 model but also indicates that IL4Ra is
required for their suppressive function.
Isolation of an IL4Ra–speciﬁc aptamer through
optimization of SELEX
The results described in Fig. 1 not only conﬁrmed that
IL4Ra plays an important role in MDSCs mediated immune
suppression but also suggested that it may be used to target
MDSCs in mammary carcinoma. To generate aptamers that
bind speciﬁcally to IL4Ra via SELEX (16), the traditional
selection method was needed to be optimized because at
physiologic pH the commercially available recombinant
IL4Ra (IgG1–IL4Ra) has a net negative charge (Supplementary Fig. S1) and most of the positively charged pockets are
present in the IgG1 portion. Under these conditions the
isolation of the aptamers speciﬁc for the IL4Ra portion of
the recombinant protein is inhibited whereas, despite a
counterselection step, isolation of anti-IgG1 or anti-linker
aptamer is facilitated. Indeed, selections procedures (15
cycles each) based on the original protocol (Supplementary
Fig. S2A) generate aptamer against IgG1 or the linker. To
overcome these limits, a new method for aptamer selection
was developed (Supplementary Fig. S2B). This method
(described in the Supplementary Methods) is based on the
use of epoxy magnetic beads directly linked to enzymatically
cleaved IL4Ra portion. The epoxy magnetic beads mediated
SELEX was used to screen a combinatorial RNA library of
approximately 1014 species for aptamers capable of binding
to the extracellular domain of murine IL4Ra. The starting
library and the RNA from the subsequent cycles were
generated with 20 -ﬂuoro-pyrimidines that were shown to
protect RNA from RNAse. After 5 cycles of ampliﬁcation,
PCR products from the selected aptamers were cloned and
single aptamers sequenced (Fig. 2). Twenty-eight percent of
the sequenced clones had an identical sequence that was
named cl.42 (Fig. 2A). Interestingly, however, additional 23%
of the sequences showed a strong similarity to the cl.42
aptamer.
To evaluate whether the cl.42 aptamer was able to specifically recognize the IL4Ra protein, the aptamer was covalently
linked at the 30 terminus with biotin-conjugated tetranucleotide using the T4-RNA ligase, a modiﬁcation unlikely to change
the tertiary RNA structure. The biotin-conjugated cl.42 aptamer was then incubated with epoxy beads loaded with IL4Ra,
with VCAM (as negative control) or left unconjugated (Fig. 2C).
As additional control, an irrelevant, biotin-labeled aptamer
was used. Streptavidin–phycoerythrin (SA-PE) conjugate was
used to visualize the aptamers bond to the beads' surface via
FACS. Whereas the irrelevant aptamer failed to recognize any
beads, the cl.42 aptamer successfully bound to the IL4Ra epoxy

www.aacrjournals.org

beads but not to the unconjugated beads or the ones loaded
with the unrelated protein VCAM. Similar results were
obtained when aptamers were directly labeled with the Cy3
dye. The calculated Kd (14 nmol/L, Fig. 2D) was within the
range of anti–IL4Ra antibodies (17) and considered to be
indicative of a good afﬁnity for aptamers (18).
To evaluate whether the anti–IL4Ra aptamer can recognize
not only the recombinant protein but also the native protein
under physiologic condition, the Cy3-conjugated cl.42 or irrelevant aptamer were incubated with the IL4RaþMSC2 cell line
in cell media at 37 C. The anti–IL4Ra aptamer effectively
recognizes the MSC2 cell line as determined by immunoﬂuorescence microscopy (Fig. 2E) or by FACS (Supplementary
Fig. S3A) with an apparent Kd of 788 nmol/L (Supplementary
Fig. S3B). Only background ﬂuorescence was seen when an
irrelevant aptamer was used.
We next evaluated whether the aptamer raised against
murine IL4Ra could cross-react with the human CD124.
Brieﬂy, human umbilical cord blood cells enriched of
CD33þIL4RaþMDSCs by a 4-day culture with recombinant
GM-CSF and G-CSF were stained with anti-CD33 antibody and
with either the cl.42 aptamer or the anti–IL4Ra antibody (Fig.
2F and Supplementary Fig. S4). FACS analysis revealed that
anti–IL4Ra aptamer recognized human CD33þMDSCs, whereas only background signal was present when an irrelevant
aptamer was used. FACS evaluation of different MDSC preparations (n ¼ 7; Fig. 2F) indicated a high degree of correlation
(R2 ¼ 0.994) between the data obtained using the anti–IL4Ra
antibody or the cl.42 aptamer, suggesting the capacity of the
latter to recognize human MDSCs.
The anti–IL4Ra aptamer cl.42 preferentially recognizes
MDSCs and tumor-associated macrophages in mice
bearing the 4T1 mammary carcinoma
We next evaluated whether the IL4Ra–speciﬁc aptamer can
bind its ligand in vivo and if preferential targeting of cell subset
occurs in tumor-bearing mice. In fact, although IL4Ra is highly
expressed in MDSCs and M2 macrophages, the receptor is also
found in most hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic cells (19,
20). WT or IL4Ra/Balb/c 4T1 bearing mice (with tumor
diameter of approximately 0.5 cm) were injected with the Cy3labeled anti–IL4Ra aptamer or with an irrelevant aptamer.
Two hours later spleens, lungs, livers, and tumors were harvested labeled with antibodies and evaluated by FACS. Cy3
signal was detectable in all the organs examined from the WTBalb/c group treated with anti-IL4Ra aptamer (Fig. 3A); in
striking contrast, only baseline signal is present in the
IL4Ra/mice treated with the anti–IL4Ra aptamer or in
the IL4Raþ/þmice treated with the irrelevant aptamer (Fig.
3A and B). A higher percentage of Cy3þcells was detectable
in the tumor specimens of WT mice treated with IL4Ra–
speciﬁc aptamer, suggesting a preferential targeting of this
tissue (Fig. 3A). FACS analysis of the tumor specimens
revealed that the Cy3þ population is positive for the myeloid
marker CD11b and is characterized by low expression of
Ly6G, high expression of Ly6C, and a bimodal expression
of the macrophage marker F4/80. In particular, in
the tumor, CD11bþGr1þLy6CþF4/80low/monocytic MDSCs

Fig. S5A), whereas in the spleen monocytic MDSCs are the
main target of the aptamer (Supplementary Fig. S5B).
To better determine the speciﬁcity of the aptamer binding in
vivo, a different gating strategy was used. After gating on singlet
alive CD11bþcells (Fig. 3B) three populations of cells can be
identiﬁed based on the Gr1 and F4/80 expression (Fig. 3C):

ﬂuorescence reveals that the anti–IL4Ra aptamer binds to all 3
myeloid populations, whereas only background signal is
obtained when the irrelevant aptamer is used. A similar gating
strategy (Fig. 3D and E) does not reveal cl.42 aptamer binding
on CD4þ and CD8þT cells, on B cells (CD19þ) on NK (DX5þ),
and on DC (CD11cþ). These data suggested that the anti–
IL4Ra aptamer speciﬁcally binds its ligand in vivo, and also
suggest preferential targeting of MDSCs and TAM in cancerbearing mice.

IL4Ra Blockade Induces MDSCs Apoptosis

The anti–IL4Ra aptamer restrains 4T1 tumor
progression, promote CD8þT-cell inﬁltration, and
reduces the number of MDSCs inﬁltrating the tumor
Aptamers not only can bind their ligands but may also
trigger a biologic function (21). Thus, we investigated whether
chronic administration of anti–IL4Ra aptamer may inﬂuence
tumor growth. IL4Raþ/þ or IL4Ra/ 4T1 bearing mice were
treated intravenously every other day with the anti–IL4Ra or
an irrelevant aptamer (16 pmol/L/g). Tumor progression was
signiﬁcantly inhibited in mice treated with the IL4Ra–speciﬁc
aptamer (Fig. 4, Supplementary Fig. S6). In sharp contrast, no
effect was observed when IL4Ra/ mice were used. If mice
were not euthanized and treatment was continued, a plateau
phase was observed after which the tumor started to grow
again and eventually the mice needed to be euthanized.
Similar results were obtained when the mammary carcinoma TSA (data not shown) or the 4T1-Thy1.1-HA-luciferase (Fig.
4B) were used. This 4T1-derived cell line allows the detection of
the metastatic disease by different means. In particular, when
Thy1.2 Balb/c mice are challenged, neoplastic cells can be
detected by FACS using the Thy1.1 marker that, in our hands,
seemed more sensitive than the use of luciferase. As shown
in Fig. 4B, the anti–IL4Ra aptamer not only inhibited the
progression of the primary tumor but also drastically reduced
the number of neoplastic cells found in the lung; both effects
are likely to depend on its speciﬁc binding to IL4Ra, as the
effect is lost when IL4Ra/mice or an irrelevant ﬂuorinated
RNA are used.
CD3 immune ﬂuorescence analysis of the 4T1 tumor specimens revealed a signiﬁcantly higher inﬁltration of T cells in the
anti–IL4Ra aptamer-treated group (Fig. 5A), suggesting that
the antitumor effect occurs through modulation of the
immune response. This result was conﬁrmed by the staining
for CD8 and Gr1 (Fig. 5B) that showed a higher inﬁltration of
CD8þcells and a signiﬁcant reduction of Gr1þcells in the group
treated with anti–IL4Ra aptamer. Interestingly, a population of
CD8þGr1þcells (a phenotype associated with the peripheral
homing of central memory T cells; ref. 22) is also detectable
and marginally (Fig. 5B insert) increased by the anti–IL4Ra
aptamer treatment. CD11b and Gr1 staining (Supplementary
Fig. S7) conﬁrmed a signiﬁcant decrease of MDSCs and
showed a similar reduction of CD11bþGr1macrophages. To
conﬁrm these data through quantitative analysis and to
expand the leukocytes studies to other populations, the experiments were repeated and multicolor FACS analysis was
conducted on tumor-derived single cells suspensions. The

gating on the alive single T cells, CD11bþcells were selected and a dot

histograms). A similar analysis was done in (D) after gating on the CD3þ
and either CD4þ or CD8þ cells. Finally, Cy3 ﬂuorescence was analyzed on
B-cells (CD19þ), NK (DX5þ), and DC (CD11cþ) cells using an additional
multicolor antibody panel (E). Data shown derived from one experiment
(5 mice per group) representative of another one.

as MDSCs, TAMs, and Tregs were signiﬁcantly decreased by
the treatment with the IL4Ra–speciﬁc aptamer, effector T cells
appeared increased. Moreover, a higher number of T cells
expressing the activation marker CD69 were detectable in
the anti–IL4Ra aptamer group compared with the irrelevant
(Fig. 5C).
Taken together, these results indicated that the anti–IL4Ra
aptamer treatment signiﬁcantly altered the tumor microenvironment, reducing the number of the negative regulators of the
immune response whereas increasing the number and the
activation status of effector T cells.

The anti–IL4Ra aptamer promotes MDSC apoptosis
The previous section indicates that anti–IL4Ra aptamer
reduced the number of MDSCs and TAM in vivo. However, the
question remained whether this effect is mediated by alterations in the recruitment/maturation or in the survival of this
leukocyte population. To better understand the effect of the
anti–IL4Ra aptamer on MDSCs, the immortalized MSC2 cell
line and MDSCs freshly isolated from tumor-bearing mice were
used. Whereas the MSC2 offers a uniform and stable source of
MDSCs, with only minimal spontaneous apoptosis, freshly
isolated MDSCs closely mimic the in vivo setting but are more
heterogeneous, and data interpretation may be compromised
by a higher level of spontaneous apoptosis, by the isolation
procedure, or by spontaneous in vitro differentiation of cell
subsets. In the ﬁrst setting, splenic CD11bþcells magnetically
puriﬁed from 4T1-bearing mice were incubated with the anti–
IL4Ra aptamer or with the control aptamer. Viability was
evaluated after 1, 2, 3, or 4 days. CD11bþcells tend to die within
3 to 4 days when cultured in vitro in normal media (Fig. 6A;
ref. 23). This pattern is not altered when the control aptamer is
added to the culture. However, when cells were treated with the
anti–IL4Ra aptamer a signiﬁcant decrease in MDSCs viability
was observed starting on day 1. In the second setting, MSC2
were incubated for 2 days with either the IL4Ra speciﬁc or an
irrelevant aptamer. A signiﬁcant increase in MSC2 apoptosis
and a concomitant reduction of viable cells was observed in the
wells treated with the anti–IL4Ra aptamer (Fig. 6B). These data
suggested a proapoptotic effect of the anti–IL4Ra aptamer on
MDSCs that is in keeping with the observation of aptamermediated reduction of MDSCs at the tumor site.
IL4Ra mediates a prosurvival signaling in MDSCs
The anti–IL4Ra aptamer-mediated apoptosis of MDSCs
observed in the previous experiments can be triggered by
different processes such as RNA engagement of TLRs (i.e.,
TLR3; refs. 24–28) or activation of RNA-dependent protein
kinase (PKR; refs. 29–33). Alternatively, aptamer binding may
modify some signaling pathways in MDSCs affecting their
survival. Because only the IL4Ra–speciﬁc aptamer, but not
an irrelevant aptamer, triggers MDSCs apoptosis at the concentration used (150 nmol/L, Fig. 6), it is unlikely that the ﬁrst 2
pathways are majorly involved in this effect. Moreover,
although a proapoptotic effect of the irrelevant aptamer on
MDSCs is detectable when the concentration is increased 100
times (data not shown), experiments using PKR-speciﬁc inhibitors or the TLR3 ligand poly(I:C) failed to, respectively, inhibit

or mimic the anti–IL4Ra aptamer-induced MDSCs apoptosis
(Supplementary Fig. S8). Because the activation of the IL4Ra–

was evaluated; (ii) CD11bþcells isolated from tumor-bearing
mice were treated with IL-13 to evaluate whether this cytokine
can promote their survival.
In the ﬁrst set of experiments, MSC2 were cultured alone, in
the presence of IL-13 neutralizing antibody or isotype control.
Media with fresh antibodies was changed on day 2. Viable cells
on day 4 were evaluated by 7ADD and Annexin V staining and
data were normalized for the number of cells recovered. IL-13
neutralization resulted in high mortality of MSC2 (Fig. 7C),
suggesting that the autocrine secretion of this cytokine acts as
a survival signal for MSC2. No effect was observed when the
isotype control was used.
In the second strategy (Fig. 7D), CD11bþcells isolated from
4T1 tumor–bearing mice were cultured in 24-well plates for 2
days in the presence of IL-13, IFN-g, both cytokines, or none.
IFN-g was used as it stimulates the expression of IL4Ra in
MDSCs (2). Only half of the cells initially plated were recovered
from the wells in which cytokines were not added (Fig. 7D).
Addition of either IFN-g or IL-13 did not signiﬁcantly increase
MDSC viability; however, when both cytokines were used, a
signiﬁcant increase of cells recovered was observed. Taken
together, these data suggested that IL4Ra expression and its
engagement could promote prosurvival signaling in MDSCs,
and that the anti–IL4Ra aptamer can counteract this effect.

CD11b cells from 4T1 tumor-bearing mice were cultured in media alone,
in the presence of the IL4Ra–speciﬁc aptamer or the irrelevant aptamer
(30 pmoles). Cells were stained with 7AAD and anti-Annexin V and
analyzed by FACS. B, MSC2 cells were cultured for 48 hours alone, with
an irrelevant aptamer or with the anti–IL4Ra aptamer. Cells were stained
with 7AAD and anti-Annexin V and analyzed by FACS. Data derived from

(Fig. 7A). Whereas the addition of the irrelevant aptamer does
not signiﬁcantly alter pSTAT6 signaling, the IL4Ra–speciﬁc
aptamer drastically reduced pSTAT6. To verify that the antiIL4Ra aptamer acts as antagonist in the absence of possible
artifacts associated with MDSCs puriﬁcation MSC2 were used
and cultured with or without IL-13. Anti–IL4Ra aptamer,
irrelevant aptamer, or no aptamer were added to the cultures.
PhosphoSTAT6 was evaluated by FACS 2 hours later (Fig. 7B).
As observed for the freshly isolated CD11b, the IL4Ra–speciﬁc
aptamer signiﬁcantly decreased the IL-13–dependent STAT6
phosphorylation, whereas no effect was observed when the
irrelevant aptamer was used. These data are further substantiated by the evaluation of arginase activity after induction with
IL-13 (Supplementary Fig. S9). Whereas the irrelevant aptamer
failed to modulate arginase activity, the anti–IL4Ra prevented
Arg1 activation (Supplementary Fig. S9). These data indicated
that the anti–IL4Ra aptamer is a blocking aptamer that
prevents IL4Ra signaling; however, they do not provide proof
whether this is the underlying cause of MDSCs apoptosis. To
determine whether IL4Ra signaling promotes MDSCs survival,
2 complementary strategies were adopted: (i) Because MSC2
cells autocrinally secrete low doses of IL-13 (data not shown),

Currently, there are 2 main approaches that are being
pursued to target MDSCs in tumor-bearing host: the ﬁrst one
focuses on compounds that alter MDSCs differentiation either
by halting MDSCs recruitment or maturation, or by forcing
MDSCs differentiation into a more mature, not immunosuppressive cell type. The second approach instead is aimed at
inhibiting the molecular mechanisms that MDSCs use to affect
tumor immunity. Speciﬁc depletion of MDSCs from the periphery is a third possible approach, but it is currently limited by the
absence of reagents that selectively target this population. We
have previously shown that IL4Ra is a good candidate, as it is
expressed on MDSCs in many murine tumor models (2), and its
expression is particularly important for the MDSC-mediated
immunosuppression in the colon carcinomas CT26s and
C26GM, in the ﬁbrosarcoma MCA203 (2) and in the A20
lymphoma (15). Moreover, CD124 is one of the ﬁrst markers
to be upregulated in bone marrow cells under cytokine regimes
that generate human and mouse MDSCs (40). Finally, its
expression in the mononuclear MDSCs population of patients
with colon cancer and melanoma correlates with the suppressive function of this population (41). Nevertheless, in some
models (i.e., EL-4; ref. 42), IL4Raþ and IL4RaMDSCs do not
differ in their suppressive activity. Here we conﬁrm the functional importance of IL4Ra in the 4T1 mammary carcinoma
(Fig. 1) and isolate a new CD124-speciﬁc RNA aptamer that
selectively depletes MDSCs from tumor-bearing mice. The
anti–IL4Ra aptamer–dependent MDSC depletion does not
rely, as is the case with most antibodies, on complementmediated cell clearance, because of the absence of the Fc
region, and it is also unlikely that cell-mediated cytotoxicity
is activated, because of the low immunogenicity that

the mechanisms of depletion, we focused our attention on the
IL4Ra pathway because preliminary experiments seemed to
exclude the involvement of both TLR3 and PKR, the two main
proteins that may trigger 20 -ﬂuoro-dsRNA–mediated apoptosis (Supplementary Fig. S8). Indeed, the addition of the IL4Ra–

IL4Ra and STAT6 play important roles in MDSC activation
and in the maintenance of their suppressive activities by
regulating Arg1 expression and TGF-b secretion (8, 43, 44).
Furthermore, genetic inactivation of STAT6 restores immune
surveillance and allows for the rejection of spontaneous metastasis in the 4T1 mammary carcinoma model.

Our data suggest an additional important role of this receptor: IL4Ra engagement could promote MDSCs resistance to
apoptosis (Figs. 6 and 7). The antiapoptotic role of IL4Ra was
elucidated in many cell types including B cells, T cells, masT
cells, and myeloid cells but, until now, not in MDSCs. Interestingly, IL-13 pretreatment has been shown to protect human
synoviocytes from nitric oxide–induced apoptosis by inducing
IRS phosphorylation and PKC activation (45). Although we
have not yet conﬁrmed this pathway in MDSCs, it is possible
that IRS activation by IL4Ra is necessary for protecting MDSCs
from the autocrinally produced NO and that the aptamermediated blockade of this pathway prevents this protective
mechanism. In any case, in this article, 3 main evidences
suggest an important antiapoptotic role of IL-13 on MDSCs:
(i) aptamer-mediated blockade of IL4Ra signaling correlates
with an increase apoptosis in MDSCs (Figs. 6 and 7); (ii) the
antibody-mediated neutralization of IL-13 in cultured MSC2
promotes their apoptosis (Fig. 7C) and 3) addition of IL-13 to
the culture media of freshly isolated MDSCs promotes their
survival (Fig. 7D). These in vitro results seem to be holding true
also in vivo as the administration of the anti–IL4Ra aptamer
correlates with a marked decrease of MDSCs and TAM at the
tumor site (Fig. 5).
Interestingly, despite the fact that IL4Ra is not a speciﬁc
marker of MDSCs, in vivo administration of the anti–IL4Ra
aptamer showed speciﬁcity for MDSCs and TAMs (Fig. 3). The
reasons for this preferential in vivo targeting of MDSCs are
currently unknown but can be related to cell-speciﬁc posttranslational modiﬁcation of CD124 that can differentiate the
IL4Ra expressed in tumor-associated MDSCs from the one
expressed in other cell types. It is important to note that the
recombinant IL4Ra toward which the aptamer has been
selected is isolated from the Balb/c myeloma cell line NSO
and, as such, is characterized by several posttranslational
modiﬁcations, including differential patterns of glycosaminoglycans typical of tumor and tumor stroma (46, 47). Alternatively, the small differences in the membrane density of CD124
or in the receptor recycling within the different cell populations may be responsible for the preferential staining of MDSCs
and TAMs. It is important to note, however, that we cannot
deﬁnitively rule out binding of the aptamer to cells other than
MDSCs and TAM below the detection levels of our analysis.
Particularly interesting are the results obtained by the
chronic administration of unconjugated aptamers to mice
bearing the 4T1 tumor. In these mice, the IL4Ra–speciﬁc
aptamer selectively depletes MDSCs and macrophages in the
tumor as well as splenic IL4RaþMDSCs. This depletion leads to

a higher inﬁltration of CD8þ and CD4þT cells in the tumor
(most of which express CD69; Fig. 5) and correlates with a
signiﬁcant reduction of tumor growth in the wild-type mice but
not in IL4RaKOmice (Fig. 4). However, it is important to
underline that treatment with the IL4Ra aptamer alone does
not lead to tumor eradication but promotes only the temporarily arrest of its growth. These results are similar to what we
saw with PDE5 inhibitors in which, despite the priming of a
spontaneous antitumor immune response, after a steady state,
the tumor grew again because other immune escape mechanisms arose (i.e., antigen loss; ref. 14).
Analysis of the metastatic disease using the 4T1HAThy1.1
model seems to indicate that aptamer treatment is sufﬁcient to
reduce the number of neoplastic cells in the lung. However, at
the moment, we cannot discriminate whether this effect is
determined by a direct action of the aptamer on the metastatic
disease or just by the fact that the size of the primary tumor is
signiﬁcantly reduced.
In conclusion, we report herein on the isolation of a new
antagonistic aptamer against mouse and human IL4Ra/CD124
that unveils the importance of the IL4Ra–STAT6 pathway in
promoting survival of MDSCs. In light of these new data, the
importance of IL4Ra/CD124 in MDSCs biology and as a
pharmacologic target justiﬁes further research, as it may have
impact on clinical treatment of cancer.
