Abstract
Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) is a dominantly inherited
cancer disorder caused by mutations at the NF2 gene locus.
Merlin, the protein product of the NF2 gene, has been shown
to negatively regulate Rac1 signaling by inhibiting its
downstream effector kinases, the p21-activated kinases
(Pak). Given the implication of Paks in tumorigenesis, it is
plausible that merlin’s tumor suppressive function might be
mediated, at least in part, via inhibition of the Paks. We
present data indicating this is indeed the case. First, analysis
of primary schwannoma samples derived from NF2 patients
showed that in a significant fraction of the tumors, the activity
of Pak1 was highly elevated. Second, we used shRNAs to
knockdown Pak1, 2, and 3 in NIH3T3 cells expressing a
dominant-negative form of merlin, NF2BBA (NIH3T3/NF2BBA),
and find that simultaneous knockdown of Pak1-3 in these cells
significantly reduced their growth rates in vitro and inhibited
their ability to form tumors in vivo. Finally, while attempting
to silence Pak1 in rat schwannoma cells, we found that
these cells were unable to tolerate long-term Pak1 inhibition
and rapidly moved to restore Pak1 levels by shutting down
Pak1 shRNA expression through a methylation-dependent
mechanism. These data suggest that inhibiting Pak could be a
beneficial approach for the development of therapeutics
toward NF2. In addition, the finding that the shRNA-mediated
Pak1 suppression was silenced rapidly by methylation raises
questions about the future application of such technologies
for the treatment of diseases such as cancer. [Cancer Res

Introduction
The hallmark of neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2), which affects
1 in 30,000 to 40,000 of the population, is the development of
bilateral vestibular schwannomas (VS) at the eighth cranial nerve.
Most NF2 patients go on to develop multiple cranial and spinal
schwannomas, meningiomas, and less frequently, intraspinal
ependymomas, with symptoms including auditory, visual, and
motor impairments. Currently, risky surgical excision is the only
treatment option, and the tumors will inevitably recur, leading
to a high early mortality rate among NF2 patients (1).
Merlin, the protein encoded by the NF2 gene, is closely related
to the ERM (ezrin, radixin, and moesin) proteins, containing an

NH2-terminal FERM domain followed by a coiled-coil domain. The
carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD) of merlin is unique and lacks the
conventional actin-binding motif found in ERM proteins. Merlin
CTD can associate with its NH2-terminal FERM domain, forming a
‘‘closed’’ and functionally active configuration. Phosphorylation of
merlin at serine 518 disrupts this intramolecular interaction and
suppresses its growth inhibitory activity. This phosphorylation is
mediated by p21-activated kinases (Pak), which bind to activated
(GTP bound) Rac/Cdc42 and function as their direct effectors (2, 3).
In addition, it has been shown that merlin S518 can also be
phosphorylated by the cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA),
whereas its dephosphorylation involves the myosin phosphatase
MYPT-1-PP1y (4, 5).
Several lines of evidence indicate that merlin is not only
regulated by the Rac-Pak axis but also functions as an inhibitor of
Rac signaling. Specifically, merlin overexpression suppresses Rac1induced activation of c-Jun-NH2-terminal kinase and activator
protein–1 transcriptional activity, whereas loss of merlin results in
the opposite (6). In addition, merlin inhibition via dominantnegative mutants or siRNA enables Rac1 recruitment to plasma
membrane and alleviates contact inhibition in confluent cells (7).
Furthermore, increased levels of activated Rac with disrupted
temporal control have been reported in primary NF2-mutant
schwannoma cells (8, 9). Finally, merlin overexpression in Schwann
cells suppresses Pak1 activity, whereas ablation of merlin in MEFs
leads to Pak1 activation (7, 10, 11). The inhibitory activity of merlin
toward Pak1 has been attributed to its direct interaction with the
Rac-binding domain of Pak1, which interferes with the binding of
activated Rac to Pak1 (10, 12).
In this study, we examine whether inhibiting Pak can reverse the
transformed and cancer phenotypes that arise from NF2 deficiency.
We find that Pak1 is hyperactive in primary schwannomas isolated
from NF2 patients and that suppression of the Paks via shRNAs
reduces the ability of NF2 mutant cells to grow in vitro and form
tumors in a xenograft model of NF2.

Materials and Methods
Schwannoma biopsies. Frozen tissue samples from NF2 patients that
underwent surgery in Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), were
received from the MGH Brain Tumor tissue repository, under the approval
of the MGH Institutional Review Board.
Two-dimensional gel analysis. Frozen tumor samples were minced and
protein was extracted in sample buffer (9.8 mol/L Urea, 2% CHAPS, 5 Al/mL
0.5% IPG buffer pH 4–7, DTT 15 mg/mL). All subsequent steps were
performed as previously described (10).
Cell culture conditions. RT4 and NIH3T3 cells were grown in lowglucose DME, 10% FCS, 1 nonessential amino acids, and 100 IU/mL
penicillin-streptomycin. Transfections were performed with Lipofectamine2000 (Invitrogen), following manufacturer’s instructions. To inhibit
DNA methylation, 5-aza-2¶-deoxycytidine (5-aza; Sigma) was added to the
media (5 ng/mL).

Knockdown of Pak1, 2, and 3 using lentiviral delivered shRNAs. For
silencing endogenous Pak1, 2, and 3 in NIH3T3 and RT4 cells, several
sequences were tested and the following targeting sequences were selected
based on their knockdown efficiency: Pak1, ‘‘5¶-GGATTCTGTGCACAGATAA’’ and ‘‘5¶-GGAATGGATGGCTCTGTCA’’; Pak2, ‘‘5¶-GAGATTATGGAGAAATTAA’’; Pak3, ‘‘5¶-GGAATTAATTATTAATGAA.’’ DNA oligos
containing individual targeting sequences were cloned into pLenti-lox3.7
(pLL3.7) as previously described (13). The resulting vectors were
cotransfected with packaging vectors VSVG and D8.9 into 293T cells and
viral supernatant was collected 48 and 72 h posttransfection. For infection,
cells were incubated with the viral supernatant overnight and infected
cells [green fluorescent protein (GFP) positive] were selected by flow
cytometry.
Western blot analysis. Protein extracts were prepared with radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer [50 mmol/L TRIS-HCl (pH 7.5), 1%
Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 150 mmol/L NaCl, 1 mmol/L
EGTA, 1 mmol/L sodium orthovanadate, and 1 mmol/L NaF]. The following
antibodies were used according to manufactures’ instructions: Pak1 (N-20),
Pak3 (N-19), merlin (C-18; Santa Cruz); Pak2 (2608; Cell Signaling); and
a-tubulin (AC42) and h-actin (AC40; Sigma).
Cell proliferation assays. Thirty thousand cells per well were plated in
12-well dishes in triplicate for each cell line. At indicated time points, cells
from individual wells were trypsinized and counted using a Coulter counter
(Z1 series; Beckman Coulter). Cells were fed every 3 d throughout the assay.
Statistical analysis was performed using Student’s t test.
Tumorigenicity assays. Cells were trypsinized, washed, and resuspended at 107 cells/mL in PBS. Cells (106; 100 AL) were injected s.c. into the
flanks of 5-wk-old nude mice (BALB/c nu/nu; The Jackson Laboratory).
Mice were monitored and tumor diameters were measured weekly after
injections.
Bisulfite sequencing. Genomic DNA was first digested with Sac I,
precipitated, and dissolved in double-distilled water (ddH2O). One
microliter of 6N NaOH was added to 19 AL ddH2O containing 2 Ag of the
digested DNA, and incubated at 37jC for 15¶. Subsequently, 120 AL bisulfite
conversion solution (107 AL 4.04M NaHSO3, 7 AL 10 mmol/L Hydroquinone,

www.aacrjournals.org

and 6 AL 6N NaOH) was added to the DNA solution, and bisulfite
conversion was carried out (30" at 95jC followed by 15¶ at 50jC for
15 cycles). Bisulfite-treated DNA was then desalted (Wizard DNA cleanup
kit; Promega) and eluted in 50 AL TE buffer. 6N NaOH (2.5 AL) was added to
the eluted DNA and incubated at RT for 5¶. DNA was precipitated and
resuspended in 30 AL ddH2O. One microliter was used as template in a
20 AL nested PCR reaction with the following primers: ‘‘5¶-TTTAAAAGAAAAGGGGGGATT’’ and ‘‘5¶-TCTCAAAACACACAATTACT.’’ One microliter of the first round was used as template for a second round of PCR using
the nested primers: ‘‘5¶-AGGGGAAAGAATAGTAGATATAA’’ and ‘‘5¶-TTAACCRAAACAAAAAATAACC.’’ The resulting PCR product was purified and
sequenced using primer ‘‘5¶-AGGGGAAAGAATAGTAGATATAA.’’
Senescence-associated B-Gal assay. Cells were washed thrice with PBS
and fixed with 0.2% glutaraldehyde for 5¶. After three washes with PBS, cells
were incubated overnight with X-gal solution [1 mg/mL X-gal, 150 mmol/L
NaCl, 2 mmol/L MgCl2, 5 mmol/L K3Fe(CN)6, 5 mmol/L K4Fe(CN)6, and
40 mmol/L NaPi (pH 6.0) at 37jC].

Results
Elevated levels of Pak1 activity in primary schwannoma
tumor samples. The activation of Pak1 involves its phosphorylation at multiple sites (10, 14, 15). We have previously established a
two-dimensional gel approach to monitor the phosphorylation
state of Pak1, which has been shown to accurately reflect the
activation state of Pak1 in the cell (7, 10). By use of this approach,
we examined the status of Pak1 in primary schwannoma samples
isolated from NF2 patients. Myelinated nerve from a patient with
wild-type NF2 was used as control. As shown in Fig. 1A, Pak1
migrates as a single spot toward the neutral pH range in ‘‘normal’’
myelinated nerve, indicating that Pak1 is mostly unphosophorylated/inactive. In contrast, with the exception of sample xt3224, 18
of the 19 schwannoma samples we analyzed displayed various
forms of phosphorylated Pak1 (Fig. 1A and B), indicative of

Pak1 activation. In 6 of the 19 samples, as exemplified by sample
xt1441, the majority of the Pak1 proteins existed in highly acidic
forms, suggestive of hyper-phosphorylation (Fig. 1A and B). In 12 of
the 19 samples, multiple forms of hypophosphorylated or hyperphosphorylated Pak1 were present, as represented by sample
xt1729. These data suggest that in primary tumors from NF2
patients, Pak1 exists in a phosphorylated/activated form. This is
consistent with previous findings that merlin acts as a direct
inhibitor of Pak1 (7, 10).
shRNA-mediated depletion of Pak1, 2, and 3 inhibits the
proliferation and tumorigenicity of NIH3T3/NF2BBA cells. We
have previously shown that expression of NF2BBA, a dominantnegative form of merlin, in NIH3T3 cells induced transformation,
loss of contact inhibition, and tumor formation when injected in
nude mice (16). Because Pak1 is the most abundant member of the
Pak family in NIH3T3 cells, we first examined the effect of Pak1
inhibition in these cells. We infected wild-type NIH3T3 or NIH3T3/
NF2BBA cells with either an empty lentiviral vector or vectors
harboring Pak1-specific small hairpin RNAs (shRNA) and selected
infected (GFP positive) cells by flow cytometry. As shown in
Fig. 2A, Pak1 protein levels were significantly reduced in cells
infected with lentiviruses carrying Pak1 shRNAs. Following the
growth kinetics of these four different cell lines, we found that,
consistent with previous findings, NIH3T3/NF2BBA cells grow faster
than wild-type NIH3T3 cells (Fig. 2B). However, we observed no
significant differences in growth rates between cells infected with
empty vectors and those with Pak1 shRNAs (Fig. 2B). We injected
these four cell lines into nude mice and found that NIH3T3/NF2BBA
cells expressing Pak1shRNAs still developed tumors of similar size
compared with control NIH3T3/NF2BBA cells (Fig. 2C). Therefore,
inhibition of Pak1 alone is not sufficient to counter the effect of
merlin impairment in NIH3T3/NF2BBA cells. Similar results were
obtained when either Pak2 or Pak3 was knocked down individually
in NIH3T3/NF2BBA cells (Supplementary Fig. S1).
Because Pak1, 2, and 3 share high sequence homologies, we
reasoned that the loss of individual Pak is likely compensated by
the other two members of Paks. To investigate this possibility, we
infected NIH3T3 with lentiviruses carrying shRNAs specific for

Pak1, Pak2, and Pak3. As shown in Fig. 3A, these NIH3T3 cells
showed significant reduction of all three Paks. We characterized
the respective proliferation kinetics of NIH3T3 and NIH3T3/NF2BBA
cells infected with control lentiviruses or those expressing shRNAs
against Pak1 to 3. In contrast to the lack of effect observed in Pak1
ablation alone, knockdown of all three Paks dramatically reduced
the growth rates of the NIH3T3/NF2BBA cells (Fig. 3B; Supplementary Fig. S1), indicating that depletion of all three Paks successfully
reversed the hyperproliferative effect of mutant merlin in our
cellular model. Knockdown of Pak1-3 also decreased the proliferation rate of wild-type NIH3T3 cells, but to a much lesser extend,
comparing to the dramatic effects observed in the NIH3T3/NF2BBA
cells (Fig. 3B).
We next injected NIH3T3/NF2BBA cells carrying empty vectors or
Pak1-3 shRNAs side by side into the flanks of nude mice and
followed the development of tumors over the course of several
weeks. In agreement with our previous study (16), the control
NIH3T3/NF2BBA cells (left flanks) quickly developed into tumors,
reaching an average diameter of 160 mm by 3 week postinjection
(Fig. 3C; Supplementary Table S1). In comparison, NIH3T3/NF2BBA
cells expressing Pak1-3 shRNAs (right flanks) resulted in either no
tumors or much smaller tumors at a considerably delayed rate. The
average diameter of tumors that eventually developed from these
cells was close to 10 mm at 3 weeks postinjection (Fig. 3C;
Supplementary Table S1). These results indicate that simultaneous
suppression of all three Paks can at least partially inhibit the ability
of Nf2BBA to induce tumor formation in a xenograft model of NF2,
which corroborate our hypothesis that inhibiting Paks could serve
as a potential treatment for NF2.
To investigate what caused the eventual development of small
tumors from injected NIH3T3/NF2BBA cells expressing Pak1-3
shRNAs in some of the mice, we isolated the tumors from both
flanks of these mice and examined the expression levels of Pak1, 2,
and 3. As shown in Fig. 3D, in two of the mice examined (#7007 and
#7049), the expression of at least two of the Paks was partially
restored to similar levels of those in tumors from control NIH3T3/
NF2BBA cells. This may explain why these cells did eventually form
tumors. In a third mouse (#7045), the levels of all three Paks

remained low in the tumor developed from Pak-shRNA expressing
NIH3T3/NF2BBA cells (Fig. 3D), indicating that additional mechanisms involved in offsetting the loss of Pak in these cells.
Schwannoma cells are dependent on Pak1 and silence Pak1
shRNA expression via de novo methylation. Because NF2
patients primarily develop Schwann cell tumors, we next examined
the effect of Pak knockdown in a well-characterized rat
schwannnoma cell line, RT4. Unlike NIH3T3 cells in which all
three Paks are expressed, RT4 cells express predominantly Pak1
(Supplementary Fig. S2). We infected RT4 cells with lentiviruses
carrying the same Pak1-specific shRNAs that were used in NIH3T3
cells (Figs. 2 and 3), and as expected, RT4 cells showed significantly
reduced Pak1 expression after the infection (Fig. 4A). However, the
Pak1 levels in RT4 cells infected with Pak1 shRNAs were quickly
restored, within two to three passages, to similar levels found in
control RT4 cells (Fig. 4A). Correspondingly, the expression level
of GFP, a positive selection marker in the lentiviral vector, pLentilox3.7, into which Pak1shRNAs were cloned, dropped rapidly
during the first two to three passages of the infected RT4 cells
(Fig. 4A).
Given the rapid nature of restoration in Pak1 levels and
concurrent down-regulation of GFP expression, we suspected that
RT4 cells might have used an epigenetic mechanism, namely DNA
methylation, to silence Pak1 shRNA expression and restore levels of
Pak1. To test whether this is indeed the case, we carried out
bisulfite sequencing to directly examine the methylation status on
the f200 bp promoter region in pLenti-lox3.7 that drives
Pak1shRNA expression. As shown in Fig. 4B, multiple CpG sites
were indeed methylated within this relatively small region in high
passage RT4 cells carrying pLenti-Pak1shRNAs. To further confirm

www.aacrjournals.org

that methylation is responsible for silencing Pak1 shRNA
expression, we added the methylation inhibitor 5-aza into the cell
culture medium of RT4 cells carrying empty vectors or Pak1
shRNAs, which had been passed at least 8 times and displayed
similar Pak1 expression levels (Fig. 4C). The cells were cultured for
several days in the presence of 5-aza, and Pak1 expression levels
were examined at different time points. In contrast to what we
observed with these cells without 5-aza treatment (Fig. 4A), after
only a single day of 5-aza treatment, Pak1 levels were significantly
lowered in RT4 cells carrying Pak1 shRNAs when compared with
control RT4 cells (Fig. 4C). We were able to sustain this suppression
of Pak1 expression for at least 3 days of treatment (Fig. 4C). Thus,
RT4 cells evade Pak1 inhibition by shutting down Pak1 shRNA
expression through methylation of the pLenti-lox3.7 promoter.
We then measured the growth rates of RT4 cells carrying empty
vectors or Pak1 shRNAs in the presence or absence of 5-aza. In the
absence of 5-aza, RT4 cells infected with Pak1 shRNAs showed
only slightly reduced growth rate compared with control RT4 cells
(Fig. 4D). In the presence of 5-aza, control RT4 cells grew relatively
slower than untreated cells (Fig. 4D). This is not surprising,
considering that 5-aza is a global methylation inhibitor. In sharp
contrast, however, RT4 cells carrying Pak1 shRNAs completely
failed to grow under culture conditions that included 5-aza
(Fig. 4D). The difference is also obvious in the morphologies of
these cells. Compared with the mostly spindle-shaped untreated or
5-aza–treated control RT4 cells, the Pak1-shRNA–infected RT4 cells
grown in the presence of 5-aza are enlarged and flattened,
displaying a morphology consistent with cellular senescence
(Fig. 4E). These cells also stained positive for the senescenceassociated expression of h-galactosidase activity, indicating that

sustained expression of Pak1shRNAs in RT4 cells leads to inhibition
of Pak1 expression, resulting in cellular senescence (Fig. 4E).
Importantly, RT4 cells transiently transfected with Pak1 siRNAs,
which should not be susceptible to methylation-mediated silencing, did not proliferate during the first few days post transfection
(Supplementary Fig. S2A). Consistent with the notion that Pak1 is
the dominant Pak in RT4 cells, cotransfection of Pak2 siRNAs with
Pak1 siRNAs failed to further reduce the growth rate of RT4 cells
(Supplementary Fig. S2B). Taken together, we concluded that RT4
cells require Pak1 for proliferation and quickly move to silence
Pak1 shRNA expression through de novo methylation.

Discussion
We have shown for the first time that Pak1 is highly activated in
primary schwannomas from NF2 patients. This is consistent with
our hypothesis that merlin functions as a tumor suppressor by
blocking Pak activation. Employing both cellular and animal
models, we directly tested this hypothesis. We found that the
simultaneous knockdown of all three Paks is required to counter
the hyperproliferation and tumor-forming capacity of NIH3T3 cells
harboring the NF2BBA allele. Taken together, these results validate
Paks as potential targets for the development of NF2 therapeutics.

Previous studies have linked Pak1 to cancer and transformation
and use of Pak inhibitors to reverse cellular transformation have
also been reported (17–19). However, these studies are inconclusive, as the inhibitors used are broad-range kinase inhibitors
that do not specifically inhibit Paks. Therefore, the important
next step is to develop specific Pak inhibitors and test them in
cellular and animal models of NF2. Another interesting finding
in this study is that different cell types respond differently to Pak1
inhibition. Although knockdown of Pak1 is inconsequential in
NIH3T3 cells (Fig. 2), Pak1 ablation in RT4 cells leads to growth
arrest (Fig. 4D; Supplementary Fig. S2). In addition, NIH3T3 cells
maintained reduced Pak1 expression mediated by Pak1 shRNAs
even after over 20 passages (data not shown), whereas RT4 cells
quickly silenced Pak1 shRNA via de novo methylation (Fig. 4A and
B). These differences suggest that although Pak1 is probably
the dominant Pak in RT4 cells, it functions redundantly with
Pak2 and Pak3 in NIH3T3 cells. However, because Pak1, 2, and 3
are highly homologous, especially within their catalytic domains,
it is most likely that any Pak inhibitors will work equally well
on all three Pak isoforms. Therefore, these cell type differences
in Pak function should not affect the effectiveness of Pak
inhibitors.

Validation of Paks as Targets in Neurofibromatosis

Finally, virus-delivered shRNA have been proposed as a
potential therapeutic tool in treating human diseases such as
cancer (20). As described in this study, an shRNA targeting an
essential gene, in our case, Pak1 in RT4 cells, can be silenced
directly by DNA methylation. Further research should be carried
out to investigate whether other cell types can also use similar
mechanisms to silence stably integrated foreign shRNA and how
frequently such events can occur. Addressing these questions
would be prudent before any future application of such
technologies as a treatment modality.
