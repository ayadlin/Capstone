Inhibition of miR-193a Expression by Max and RXRa
Activates K-Ras and PLAU to Mediate Distinct Aspects of
Cellular Transformation
Dimitrios Iliopoulos, Asaf Rotem, and Kevin Struhl

Abstract
MicroRNA profiling in isogenic models of cellular transformation involving either breast epithelial cells or
fibroblasts reveals that expression of miR-193a is lower in transformed cells than in nontransformed cells. The
transcription factors Max and RXRa bind directly to the miR-193a promoter and inhibit miR-193a expression
during transformation. miR-193a inhibits cellular transformation by directly targeting the 30 untranslated
regions of PLAU and K-Ras. Interestingly, miR-193a controls anchorage-independent growth in soft agar through
K-Ras, whereas it affects invasive growth through PLAU. miR-193a overexpression inhibits the tumorigenicity of
developmentally diverse but not all cancer cell types, and it inhibits tumor growth in colon- and breast-derived
xenografts. Finally, expression of miR-193a is inversely correlated with PLAU and K-Ras in human colon
adenocarcinomas. Thus, a pathway in which Max and RXRa inhibit miR-193a expression, thereby activating the
PLAU and K-Ras oncogenes is important for distinct aspects of cellular transformation, as well as tumor growth
and colon (and perhaps other types of) cancer. Cancer Res; 71(15); 5144–53. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
Comparative transcriptional profiling is a common way to
identify genes important for carcinogenesis, and a variety of
approaches have been used. Transcriptional profiles are compared among (i) groups of patients with different types of
cancer, (ii) primary tumor samples and normal samples from
the same patient, (iii) transformed and nontransformed cell
lines, and (iv) cell lines that do or do not overexpress an
oncogene. Each of these approaches has advantages and
disadvantages, but all of them have contributed to our understanding of cellular transformation and cancer.
In previous work, we identified a cancer gene signature on
the basis of the identification of genes that are differentially
expressed in 2 isogenic models of cellular transformation (1).
One model involves nontransformed mammary epithelial cells
(MCF-10A; ref. 2) containing ER-Src, a derivative of the Src
kinase oncoprotein (v-Src) that is fused to the ligand-binding
domain of the estrogen receptor (3). Treatment of such cells
with tamoxifen rapidly induces Src, and morphologic trans-

formation is observed within 24 to 36 hours (4, 5), thereby
making it possible to kinetically follow the transition between
nontransformed and transformed cells. The other model
consists of 3 isogenic cell lines derived from primary fibroblasts in a serial manner (6): EH is immortalized by overexpression of telomerase (hTERT) and exhibits normal
morphology; EL also expresses SV40 T antigens and displays
an altered morphology but is not transformed; and ELR also
expresses oncogenic Ras (H-RasV12), and it is transformed by
numerous criteria including tumor formation in mouse xenografts.
The availability of transcriptional profiles for isogenic, but
biologically unrelated, models of cellular transformation
makes it possible to distinguish between genes that play a
relatively general role in transformation as opposed to those
affected only by the specific experimental model. Indeed, the
343-gene signature derived from the combined analysis of
these isogenic models is highly correlated with a wide variety
of human cancers, thereby validating the clinical relevance of
our experimental models (1). Of particular interest, this gene
signature links cancer with a variety of inflammatory and
metabolic diseases, suggesting that a common transcriptional
program is involved is phenotypically disparate diseases (1). In
the breast epithelial model, transient activation of Src causes
an epigenetic switch from nontransformed to transformed
cells that involves a positive feedback loop that is associated
with a chronic inflammatory state (5, 7).
MicroRNAs (miRNA) play critical roles in cancer and other
biological processes by directly interacting with specific
mRNAs through base pairing and then inhibiting expression
of the target genes through a variety of molecular mechanisms
(8–10). In the breast epithelial (ER-Src) model, 29 miRNAs are

differentially regulated during the process of transformation,
and many of these are important for transformation (5, 7). In
particular, downregulation of the Let-7 family and induction
of miR-21 and miR-181b are part of the inflammatory feedback
loop necessary for the establishment and maintenance of the
transformed state. In addition, 22 miRNAs are differentially
expressed in cancer stem cells and non–cancer stem cells that
arise during the transformation process (11), with the miR-200
family being particularly important for the function of cancer
stem cells via repression of polycomb complexes (12–14).
Here, we conduct miRNA profiling in the fibroblast model of
cellular transformation and identify 22 differentially regulated
miRNAs, 7 of which are similarly regulated in the breast
epithelial system. We focus here on miR-193a, which is highly
downregulated during transformation of both the ER-Src and
fibroblast models. miR-193a is downregulated in oral cancer
via DNA hypermethylation (15), and it is poorly expressed in
melanomas containing a B-Raf mutation (16). The related
miR-193b is 88% identical to miR-193a but is encoded by a
separate gene that is regulated differently. miR-193b has been
implicated as a tumor suppressor in breast (17), prostate (18),
and hepatocellular cancers (19), but high levels of miR-193b
are associated with poor prognosis of malignant melanomas
(16).
We define a molecular pathway in which expression of miR193a is directly inhibited by Max and RXRa, thereby leading to
increased expression of PLAU and K-Ras, which are direct
targets of miR-193a. Furthermore, we show that PLAU and
K-Ras have distinct roles in transformation, with PLAU affecting invasiveness, whereas K-Ras affects tumorigenicity. miR193a acts as a tumor suppressor in developmental diverse
cancer cell lines, and miR-193a expression is inversely correlated with both PLAU and K-Ras in human colon adenocarcinomas, suggesting that this pathway is important for some
types of human cancer.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture
MCF-10A cells containing the ER-Src fusion protein were
grown in DMEM/F12 medium supplemented with 5% donor
horse serum (HS), 20 ng/mL epidermal growth factor (EGF),
10 mg/mL insulin, 100 mg/mL hydrocortisone, 1 ng/mL
cholera toxin, and 50 units/mL pen/strep, with the addition
of puromycin (4, 5). Cells were passaged fewer than 3 months
from resuscitation from the originally described cells (4, 5). To
induce transformation, the Src oncogene was activated by the
addition of 1 mmol/L tamoxifen (Sigma) to confluent cell
cultures. BJ fibroblast cell lines were grown in knockoutDulbecco's modified Eagle's media (KO-DMEM) containing
14% FBS, Medium 199 glutamine, and pen/strep (6). All other
cancer cell lines were obtained from American Type Culture
Collection and grown in DMEM, 10% FBS, and pen/strep; cells
were passaged fewer than 3 months from resuscitation.
MicroRNA expression analysis
Expression levels of 365 microRNAs at various times after
tamoxifen addition and from nontransformed and trans-

www.aacrjournals.org

formed fibroblasts were evaluated with microRNA profiling
assays (TLDA human miRNA v1.0) in the Dana Farber Molecular Diagnostics Facility. Validation of these results was
conducted using the mirVana qRT-PCR miRNA Detection
Kit and qRT-PCR Primer Sets, according to the manufacturer's
instructions (Ambion Inc.). RNU48 expression was used as an
internal control.
Soft agar colony and invasion assays for the effect of
miRNAs on transformation
For the genetic screen to identify miRNAs that act as tumor
suppressors, the transformed fibroblast line (ELR) was treated
individually with 365 miRNAs (100 nmol/L) for 24 hours.
For other experiments, miR-193a (PM11123), miR-193b
(PM12383), or an miR-negative control (AM17110) from
Ambion Inc. were introduced at 100 nmol/L into a variety
of breast and other types of cancer cell lines for 24 hours. In
the case of ER-Src cells, tamoxifen was added and cellular
transformation was assessed 36 hours later (total time: 60
hours). The soft agar colony and Matrigel invasion assays were
conducted as described previously (1, 5). In all cases, experiments were repeated thrice, and the statistical significance
was calculated using Student's t test.
RNA analysis
For samples generated in this work, RNA was purified by the
TRIzol method (Invitrogen), reverse transcribed to generate
cDNA, and analyzed by SYBR Green–based real-time PCR,
with the level of b-actin used as a loading control. RNAs from
colon adenocarcinomas (Origene and BioChain Inc.) were
analyzed for levels of PLAU, K-Ras, and miR-193a. Each sample
was run in triplicate, and the data represent the mean  SD.
Correlation coefficients between PLAU, K-Ras, and miR-193a
expression levels in these colon adenocarcinomas were determined.
30 UTR luciferase assay
Firefly luciferase reporter constructs containing the 30
untranslated regions (UTR) of PLAU (s207136 from Switchgear
Genomics) and K-Ras (HmiT010133 from GeneCopoeia Inc.)
were transfected in MCF-10A ER-Src cells along with 100
nmol/L miR-193a or an miRNA control. Cell extracts were
prepared 24 hours after transfection, and luciferase activity
was measured using the Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay
System (Promega).
siRNA experiments
Cells seeded in 6-well plates were transfected with siRNAs
against PLAU (s10610), K-Ras (s15602), RXRa (s12386, s12384),
Max (s224030, s8540), or a negative control (AM4611) together
with antisense against miR-193a (AM11123), miR-193
(AM12383), or a control antisense (AM17010) using the
siPORT NeoFX transfection agent. Oligonucleotides (Ambion
Inc.) were used at 50 to 100 nmol/L per well. No cell toxicity
was detected because of the transfection agent. The resulting
cells were analyzed for transformation or RNA levels as
described above. All oligonucleotide transfection experiments
were carried out in triplicate.

Xenograft experiments
MDA-MB-231, HCT-116, and HT-29 cancer cells were
injected subcutaneously in the right flank of athymic nude
mice (Charles River Laboratories), and tumors were allowed to
develop for 10 days (tumor volume  100 mm3). Mice bearing
tumors were randomly distributed in 6 groups (4 mice per
group) and treated intraperitoneally with miR-193a
(120 nmol/L) or a negative control miR (mixed with liposomes; Altogen Biosystems Inc.; 5010) for 3 cycles (days 10,
15, 20). Tumor growth was monitored every 5 days. Nude
mice were maintained in accordance with the Animal Care

Results
Differentially regulated miRNAs during transformation
in the isogenic fibroblast model
In the previous work, we conducted microRNA profiling in
an inducible model cellular transformation in breast epithelial
cells and identified 29 differentially expressed miRNAs during
the transformation process (7). Here, we conducted a similar
miRNA profiling analysis in 3 cell isogenic cell lines derived
from primary fibroblasts that are immortalized (hTERT),
predisposed (hTERT þ T antigen), and transformed
(hTERT þ T antigen þ v-Ras). A comparison between immortalized (EH) and transformed (ELR) cell lines identifies 7 miRNAs that are upregulated and 15 miRNAs that are
downregulated in the transformed state (Fig. 1A). Most of
these miRNAs are not differentially regulated in the predisposed (EL) cell line, although there are some exceptions.
Of the 22 miRNAs differentially regulated in the fibroblast
model, 7 are regulated in the same manner during Src-induced
transformation in the MCF-10A system (Fig. 1A). All but one of
the remaining 15 miRNAs are not regulated in the breast
epithelial system (the exceptional miR-132 is regulated in
the opposite manner). miR-21 is upregulated in both isogenic
models, whereas miR-148b, miR-335, miR-193a, and several
members of the Let-7 family are downregulated in both models.
MicroRNAs that inhibit tumorigenicity of transformed
fibroblasts
As a genetic screen to identify miRNAs that function as
tumor suppressors in the fibroblast model, we individually
overexpressed 365 miRNAs in the transformed fibroblasts
(ELR line) and examined the effect on tumorigenicity as
assayed by colony formation in soft agar. This screen iden-

tified 18 miRNAs that inhibit tumorigenicity and 4 miRNAs
that slightly enhance tumorigenicity of the transformed
fibroblasts (Fig. 1B and Supplementary Fig. S1). All miRNAs
downregulated in the transformed cells cause reduced
tumorigenicity, and in most cases, the effect is substantial,
suggesting that these miRNAs function as tumor suppressors in the fibroblast model. Importantly, miR-148b, miR335, miR-193a, and the Let-7 family members also inhibit
transformation in the breast epithelial system (7), suggesting
that these miRNAs function as tumor suppressors in multiple cell types. In this article, we focus on miR-193a because
molecular pathways involving this miRNA are essentially
unknown.

tumorigenicity and invasive growth in genetically

models. To extend these findings, we analyzed miR-193a and
miR-193b expression and function in genetically distinct
breast cancer cell lines. In nontransformed MCF-10A cells,
miR-193a and miR-193b levels are roughly comparable, with
perhaps slightly higher levels for miR-193b (Fig. 2A). In all
breast cancer cell lines tested, miR-193a is expressed in lower
levels than in immortalized, nontransformed breast cells
(Fig. 2A). Furthermore, in all breast cancer cell lines tested,
miR-193a overexpression significantly reduces colony formation in soft agar (Fig. 2B). Finally, overexpression of miR-193a
in these breast cancer cells reduces the number of invading
cells in a Matrigel assay (Fig. 2C). In comparison, levels of miR193b are more consistent (although not identical) among the
cell lines, and the effects on colony formation are less pronounced (Fig. 2A and B). Thus, miR-193a inhibits cellular

miR-193a regulates directly the expression of PLAU and
K-RAS in breast cancer cells
To investigate how miR-193a exerts its anticancer effects,
we generated a list of candidate target genes using 3 prediction algorithms (PicTar, TargetScan, Sanger) on the basis of
sequence complementarity to 30 UTRs. Among these candidate
target genes, PLAU and K-Ras expression is upregulated, and
hence inversely correlated, with miR-193a expression in both
transformation models. Furthermore, during the process of
cellular transformation in the inducible breast epithelial
model, expression of both PLAU (Fig. 3A) and K-Ras
(Fig. 3B) gradually increases in parallel to decreasing expression of miR-193a. In the transformed state (36 hours after

expression (Fig. 3D). These results indicate that miR-193a
directly inhibits PLAU and K-Ras expression.
miR-193a controls tumorigenicity through K-Ras and
invasiveness through PLAU
PLAU is a metastasis-associated protein that supports cell
migration and matrix proteases activity (20), and K-Ras is
involved in many oncogenic functions such as antiapoptotic
activity, angiogenesis, motility, and cell growth (21). To
address the roles PLAU and K-Ras play in breast cell transformation, we inhibited the expression of either one of these
genes (by siRNA; Supplementary Fig. S2) and miR-193a or miR193b (by antisense RNA) in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells
and measured tumorigenicity and invasiveness. As expected,
inhibition of miR-193a results in both increased tumorigenicity (Fig. 4A) and increased invasiveness (Fig. 4B), whereas
inhibition of miR-193b has little effect. In the context of
reduced levels of miR-193a, inhibition of K-Ras reduced
tumorigenicity (colony formation in soft agar), whereas inhibition of PLAU had no significant effect (Fig. 4A). In contrast,
inhibition of PLAU blocked the increased invasiveness due to
inhibition of miR-193a, whereas inhibition of K-Ras has no
effect (Fig. 4B). These observations suggest that miR-193a

controls the tumorigenicity of breast cancer cells through
regulation of K-Ras, whereas it affects their invasiveness
through regulation of PLAU.
Max and RXRa bind directly to the miR-193a promoter
and inhibit miR-193a expression during
transformation
The reduced expression of miR-193a expression during
transformation is likely due to a transcription factor(s) that
binds to specific DNA sequences in the miR-193a promoter and
acts, formally, as a transcriptional repressor. We previously
used the Lever algorithm (22) to predict putative transcription
factor–binding sites associated with promoters of differentially
expressed miRNAs (7). Among the 466 human transcription
factor–binding site motifs from the TRANSFAC database and
the 272 mouse transcription factor–binding motifs derived by
universal protein-binding microarrays, the combination of
Max and RXRa ranked among the top combinations for
differentially regulated miRNAs including miR-193a.
In accord with these predictions, chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments indicate that Max (Fig. 5A) and RXRa
(Fig. 5B) bound to the miR-193a regulatory region in ER-Src–
transformed cells; minimal binding was observed in the nontransformed cells. Similarly, both Max and RXRa bind the
miR-148a, miR-148b, and miR-181b promoters in transformed
but not nontransformed ER-Src cells. Thus, the combination
of Max and RXRa binds to the miR-193a and other promoters
that are regulated during the transformation process.
Using siRNA-mediated inhibition, we examined the effect of
Max and RXRa on transcription of miR-193a at various times
during the transformation process (Fig. 5C). Importantly, the
decreased level of miR-193a during the late stage of the
transformation (2424 and 36 hours after induction) is blocked
by inhibition of Max (completely by one siRNA and strongly by
another siRNA). In contrast, inhibition of RXRa has a modest,
but significant (P < 0.001), effect on the downregulation of
miR-193a levels. Similar results for Max and RXRa are
observed on the level of the miR-193a primary transcript
(Fig. 5D), indicating that repression occurs via a transcriptional mechanism as opposed to a posttranscriptional
mechanism involving processing of the miR-193a transcript.
Thus, miR-193a transcription is directly repressed by Max and
(to a much lesser extent) RXRa at later stages of transformation.
We also examined the effect of Max and RXRa on expression of the other miRNAs whose promoters are bound by these
transcription factors (Fig. 5E). As observed for miR-193a,
repression of miR-148a and miR-148b in transformed cells
(36 hours after tamoxifen treatment) is blocked by inhibition
of Max and mildly alleviated by inhibition of RXRa. In contrast, miR-181b is induced in transformed cells, and this
induction is blocked by the combined inhibition of Max
and RXRa. Individually, both Max and RXRa are important
for miR-181b induction, with RXRa having a stronger influence on expression levels (Fig. 5E). Thus, the combination of
Max and RXRa directly regulates expression of target miRNA
promoters, although regulation can be either positive or
negative depending on the target.

(Panc1) cells as assayed by colony formation in soft agar
(Fig. 6A). miR-193a has a modest effect on tumorigenicity of
hepatocellular cancer cells (Hep3B), but it has little, if any,
effect on prostate (PC3), lung (A549), or cervical (HeLa) cancer
cells. Thus, miR-193a appears to act as a tumor suppressor in
breast, colorectal, and pancreatic cancer cells, but it has limited
effects in a variety of other cancer cell types. Interestingly, the
cell lines showing a tumor suppressive effect of miR-193a
typically have lower miR-193a expression levels than cell lines
not showing this effect (Fig. 6B). This observation suggests that
miR-193a is a tumor suppressor in most (and perhaps all)
cancer cell types, but that detection of this function occurs only
in cell types with reduced miR-193a levels that can be compensated by ectopic expression of miR-193a.
miR-193a acts as a tumor suppressor in mouse

To examine whether miR-193a acts as tumor suppressor in
vivo, we injected nude mice subcutaneously with colorectal

and allowed tumors to develop for 10 days. We then carried
out intraperitoneal injection of miR-193a or a negative control
miRNA near these small tumors (3 cycles on days 10, 15, 20)
and monitored tumor size every 5 days. Over the course of a
month, mice treated with miR-193a show reduced tumor
growth as compared with mice treated with the control
(Fig. 6C). Thus, miR-193a suppresses tumor growth in mouse
xenografts generated by breast and colorectal cancer cells,
indicating that low levels of miR-193a are required to maintain
transformation in these cell types.
miR-193a levels are negatively correlated with PLAU
and K-Ras in cancer tissues
In previous studies, we established the cancer relevance of
miRNA–target interactions by determining the relationship
between their RNA levels in human cancer patients (5, 7, 12).
Specifically, an inverse correlation between miRNA and target
mRNA levels in a set of cancer patients indicates that the
miRNA–target interaction (as opposed to the miRNA or target
individually) plays an important role in human cancer. In this

regard, there are strong inverse relationships between miR193a and PLAU RNA levels as well as miR-193a and K-Ras RNA
levels in colon cancer patients (Fig. 6D). Thus, miR-193a
regulation of PLAU and K-Ras is relevant for at least some
types of cancer.

Discussion
In this work, we describe a gene regulatory pathway involved
in cellular transformation (Fig. 7). In this pathway, Max and (to
a lesser extent) RXRa, directly binds the miR-193a promoter
and inhibits transcription of the gene. The resulting reduction
in miR-193a levels leads to increased expression of PLAU and
K-Ras, which are direct targets of miR-193a. Increased levels of
PLAU and K-Ras contribute to distinct aspects of cellular
transformation, with PLAU being important for the invasive
growth and K-Ras being important for tumorigenicity.
The combination of Max and RXRa binding motifs is
strongly enriched in miRNA promoters whose expression is
differentially regulated during transformation (7). Indeed, both
Max and RXRa bind to at least 4 miRNA promoters and affect
transcription of the target genes. This observation strongly
suggests that this combination of transcription factors contributes to the process of cellular transformation by regulating
multiple miRNAs and presumably mRNAs. Interestingly, the
combination of Max and RXRa can either repress or activate
expression of miRNA genes, with Max appearing to be more
important for repression and RXRa appearing to be more
important for activation. Max binds DNA in association with
Myc and other Myc family proteins, and the resulting heteromeric complexes can activate or repress transcription. In this
regard, Myc represses transcription of a variety of miRNAs (23,
24). RXRa is a member of a family of nuclear receptors that
mediate breast and prostate cancer cell growth (25–28). Our
results do not address which Myc family members associate
with Max at the miR-193a promoters, nor do they address the
molecular mechanism of repression. In addition, the role of
Max and RXRa in repressing miR-193a expression has been
established only in the breast epithelial (ER-Src) model, and
this mechanism differs from the downregulation of miR-193a
by DNA methylation in oral cancer (15). Nevertheless, we
suspect that Max and RXRa will be important for regulating
miR-193a in other breast cell lines and perhaps other cell types.
miR-193a has been suggested to be a tumor suppressor
because the gene is inactivated by DNA methylation in oral
cancer (15) and poorly expressed in B-Raf melanomas (16).

cellular transformation process and that miR-193a downregulation is required for transformation in 2 different isogenic
models provide direct evidence that miR-193a is a tumor
suppressor. Furthermore, the tumor suppressive effects of
miR-193a are observed in genetically distinct breast cancer
cell lines, multiple colon cancer cell lines, a pancreatic cancer
cell line, and in mouse xenografts generated by colon or
breast cancer cells, indicating a widespread role of miR193a in cellular transformation and tumor growth. However,
consistent with the general idea that cancer types differ greatly
in terms of the genetic and epigenetic events responsible for
the diseased state, overexpression of miR-193a does not reduce
tumorigenicity in all cancer cell types. In general, the effect of
miR-193a is observed in cancer cell lines that have low levels of
miR-193a, suggesting that miR-193a overexpression compensates for these low levels and reverses the transformed state.
These observations suggest that miR-193a is a tumor suppressor in many, and perhaps all cell types, but that only some
cancer cell types are associated with low miR-193a expression.
miR-193a directly targets PLAU and K-Ras and inhibits
expression of these genes in genetically distinct breast
cancer cell lines. Furthermore, under conditions in which
miR-193a levels are reduced via an antisense RNA, PLAU and
K-Ras are required, respectively, for invasive growth and
tumorigenicity, indicating that these miRNA–target interactions are relevant for distinct aspects of cellular transformation. More importantly, expression of miR-193a is inversely
correlated with both PLAU and K-Ras in samples from
human colon cancer patients, indicating that the miR193a interactions with PLAU and K-Ras are relevant for
human colon cancer. We suspect that inhibition of PLAU
and K-Ras by miR-193a will be relevant for other types of
cancer, but this remains to be established directly by analysis of patient samples.
As indicated by their names, miR-193a and miR-193b are
related miRNAs that possess the identical 8-nucleotide seed
sequence and share 18 of 22 nucleotides (miR-193c is a 21-bp
version of miR-193b). miR-193a and miR-193b are encoded by
separate genes located on different chromosomes, and their
promoter regions are essentially unrelated. As a consequence,
miR-193a and miR-193b are not coordinately regulated. In the
2 isogenic models employed here, miR-193a levels are significantly reduced during transformation, whereas miR-193b
levels remain essentially unchanged.
The similarity between miR-193a and miR-193b suggests
that these miR-193 paralogues have redundant functions,
and indeed both paralogues inhibit expression of PLAU.
However, in both isogenic models, reduced levels of miR193a cause transformation, even though miR-193b appears to
be expressed at comparable, and perhaps slightly higher,
levels than miR-193a, suggesting that these miR-193 paralogues may have some nonredundant functions. Conversely,
nonredundant functions are likely to explain why miR-193b
can act as a tumor suppressor in cases where miR-193a is also
expressed. For example, while miR-193a and miR-193b affect
some common targets (e.g., PLAU), there may be other targets
that are differentially affected by these miR-193 paralogues.
Even in cases like PLAU (or other genes affected by both

miR-193a and miR-193b), inhibition by one miR-193 paralogue
might be more robust than inhibition by the other paralogue.
The idea that miR-193a and miR-193b have nonredundant
functions may explain some previous observations. As shown
here, miR-193a appears to play a role in distinguishing nontransformed cells from transformed cells, whereas previous
studies suggest that miR-193b is important in distinguishing
metastatic from hypermetastatic cancer cells. In addition, while
low levels of miR-193a are associated with melanoma, high levels
of miR-193b are associated with poor prognosis of this disease
(16). This situation in melanoma may mimic the situation in the
isogenic models studied here where the transformed state is
associated with low levels of miR-193a in the context of substantial levels of miR-193b. Although details of functional distinctions between miR-193a and miR-193b remain to be
resolved, our results identify a molecular pathway specifically
involving miR-193a that is important for cellular transformation.
