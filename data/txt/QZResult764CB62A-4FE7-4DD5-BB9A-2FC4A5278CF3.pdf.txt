BACKGROUND. Adding trastuzumab to adjuvant chemotherapy provides significant clinical benefit in patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2
(HER2)-positive breast cancer. A cost-effectiveness analysis was performed to
assess clinical and economic implications of adding trastuzumab to adjuvant
chemotherapy, based upon joint analysis of NSABP B-31 and NCCTG N9831
trials.

METHODS. A Markov model with 4 health states was used to estimate the cost

multiway sensitivity analysis). Discounted incremental lifetime cost was $44,923,
and projected life expectancy was 3 years longer for patients who received trastuzumab (19.4 years vs 16.4 years). During a 20-year horizon, the projected cost of adding trastuzumab to chemotherapy was $34,201 per QALY gained. Key costeffectiveness drivers were discount rate, trastuzumab price, and probability of metastasis. The cost-effectiveness result was robust to sensitivity analysis.

was projected to be cost effective over a lifetime horizon, achieving a cost-effectiveness ratio below that of many widely accepted oncology treatments. Cancer

combination with paclitaxel or as monotherapy in
patients who have received 1 or more chemotherapy
regimens for their metastatic disease. Trastuzumab
was also recently approved for the adjuvant treatment
of HER2-positive early breast cancer, in combination
with chemotherapy, after assessment in several
trials.5–8
The joint analysis of the National Cancer Institutesponsored National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel
Project (NSABP) B-31 and the North Central Cancer
Treatment Group (NCCTG) N9831 trials demonstrated
that the addition of trastuzumab to the standard adjuvant regimen of doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide
(AC) followed by paclitaxel reduced the risk of recurrence
by 52% (P < .0001) and improved survival by 33%
(P 5 .015) in patients with HER2-positive, operable, early
breast cancer.5 The incidence of New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III or IV congestive heart failure or
death from cardiac causes was higher in the trastuzumab-containing arms than in the control arms.5,9–11
Five-year survival rates for early stage breast cancer have significantly improved during the past 3 decades (88% in 1995–2001 vs 75% in 1974–1976;
P < .05)1; the reduction in 5-year mortality reflects in
part the cumulative progress made in adjuvant therapy for the disease during the past 20 years. However,
individual incremental improvements in the efficacy
of new adjuvant therapies are seldom large in either
relative or absolute terms. Hence, the 52% reduction
in disease recurrence observed with the addition of
trastuzumab to standard adjuvant chemotherapy in
the subgroup with aggressive HER2-positive cancers is
a substantial development compared with recent
advances in other cancers.
The objective of this analysis was to develop a
model to estimate the incremental cost effectiveness
of adjuvant trastuzumab for early stage, HER2-positive, breast cancer in the US, based upon the joint
analysis of the NSABP B-31 and NCCTG N9831 trials.
Two analyses of adjuvant trastuzumab in the US setting were published recently.12,13 Although their overall conclusions were similar to earlier meeting
abstracts and European analyses,14–21 the base-case
cost-effectiveness estimates varied substantially—
from $18,970 to $39,982 per adjusted life-year (QALY)
gained. This model and analysis, based upon a different modeling approach and assumptions, provide
additional evidence on potential cost effectiveness.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Model Overview
This economic evaluation was a cost-utility assessment that compared projected costs and outcomes

of 2 alternative treatment options on the basis of trial
results from both a payer and a societal perspective.
The cost-effectiveness analysis was based on the
joint analysis comparison of the nontrastuzumabcontaining arm (Arm 1 in NSABP B-31 and Arm A in
NCCTG N9831) with the trastuzumab-containing
arm (Arm 2 in NSABP B-31 and Arm C in NCCTG
N9831) (Fig. 1).5 Disease-free survival was the prespecified primary endpoint of the combined efficacy
analysis of these trials.
Long-term survival and outcome data were projected from the 4-year joint analysis data5 and extrapolated to 20-year and lifetime horizons based on
a Markov model. A Markov model comprising 4
health states (treatment, disease-free, distant recurrence, and death) was developed to assess expected
costs and life-years and QALYs gained over time (Fig.
2). The model assumed that all patients received
treatment during the first year while they were still
disease-free. After distant recurrence, the process of
progression to metastasis and death was modeled as
a simple aggregate cost and QALY outcome. In this
aggregate, all patients were assumed to have received
trastuzumab treatment after distant recurrence. To
further simplify the model, and because no reliable
estimates of differences between study arms were
available, health states of contralateral disease or
local recurrence were not explicitly defined, but their
impact is reflected in the estimated time to distant
recurrence based on trial data. Cardiac dysfunction
associated with the addition of trastuzumab was
assumed to be reversible (although more data are
needed to confirm this)10,22 and to have no direct
mortality impact beyond that reflected in the 4-year
trial period.

Patient Population
The base-case estimates were for a ‘‘typical’’ patient
enrolled in the trials—a 50-year-old woman. In the
arms of the 2 trials, 50% to 52% of patients were
aged younger than 50 years.5 Estimates of actual disease recurrence and patient survival were based on
the joint analysis.5 An intent-to-treat basis was followed. Patients were eligible if they had invasive
breast cancer resected by lumpectomy or mastectomy and axillary dissection with pathologically
involved axillary nodes (amended in NCCTG N9831
to allow patients with high-risk, node-negative disease). The tumor had to be HER2-positive (immunohistochemistry score of 31 or fluorescence in situ
hybridization [FISH]-positive) and had to be verified
centrally [NCCTG N9831] or by an approved laboratory [NSABP B-31]). Patients had to have normal hematologic, hepatic, and renal function, and normal

left ventricular ejection fraction, as assessed by multigated acquisition scan or echocardiogram. Patients
were excluded when they had locally advanced or
distant disease, had received prior anthracycline or
taxane therapy, had significant sensory or motor neuropathy, or had past or active cardiac disease.

Costs
Healthcare resource costs were based on 2006 Medicare reimbursement rates and other published data
(Table 1)5,23–29 and are expressed in US dollars
throughout. On the basis of the 20% to 30% incidence of HER2 positivity among breast tumors,2 we
assumed that 5 tests were performed on average for
every patient identified for trastuzumab treatment,
recognizing that some patients may have had more
than 1 test. Both immunohistochemistry and FISH
tests were available, and 30% of tests were assumed
to be FISH in the base case.29

The estimated drug cost per patient was based
on the average wholesale price per vial24 and the duration of treatment.5 A total of 53 infusions were
planned, but 19.9% of patients discontinued trastuzumab treatment30; and based on trial data, the average total dose received was estimated to be 25% less
than the protocol dose.
In both trials, cardiac function was monitored
before, during, and after therapy. On the basis of trial
protocol and discontinuations, an estimated mean of
4.7 multigated acquisition scans or echocardiogram
examinations per patient were performed to assess
and monitor left ventricular ejection fraction. The
mean cost per left ventricular ejection fraction examination was $367, yielding a total cost of $1726.23 On
the basis of results of the NCCTG N9831 trial, the
rate of cardiac events (defined NYHA class III or IV
congestive heart failure, or probable or definite cardiac death) was assumed to be 2.9% in the trastuzumab-containing arm and 0% in the control arm.5
The mean cost of treating a cardiac event was
assumed to be $1979.23 On the basis of published
data, the cost of metastatic breast cancer was modeled as a single cost of $40,000, which was adjusted
for inflation,25 and mean costs associated with death
were assumed to be $10,000.
As trastuzumab therapy is scheduled for 52
weeks, which is beyond the time period for standard
chemotherapy alone, the patient incurs additional
expense from a societal perspective. Incremental
indirect costs related to trastuzumab treatment were
estimated, reflecting time and expenses for travel
and medical visits (Table 1). Time was valued at
the average hourly compensation rate from the US
Bureau of Labor Statistics,31 and travel costs were

This is only a partial societal perspective, as any gain
from potential greater labor force attachment or productivity was not estimated.

Quality-of-Life Utility Assumptions
Adjustment was made for quality of life in the 4 different health states, but no differences were assumed
across the arms with the exception of the treatment
period. Utility during the first year of treatment was
assumed to be 0.77 in the control arm and 0.71 in
the trastuzumab arm (Table 1). The lower utility estimate for the trastuzumab arm was because of the
longer duration of treatment and the assumption

that utility during trastuzumab treatment was lower
than utility without treatment (0.8 vs 0.9). In both
arms, the utility level of 12 weeks of paclitaxel use
was 0.5; the assumed values of 0.77 and 0.71 are
weighted averages of these 3 respective values based
on the chemotherapy protocol. During the stable-disease state before recurrence, utility was assumed to
be 0.9.26 After recurrence, utility with metastatic
breast cancer was assumed to be 0.6.27 These utility
scores were used to adjust survival time in each
health state to produce a composite measure of utility—the quality-adjusted life year (QALY). The QALY
is a widely used measure that adjusts the quantity of
life gained by the quality of that life. The cost per
QALY is a useful measure, as the ratio is not disease-

Cost-Effectiveness of Adjuvant Trastuzumab/Garrison et al.

specific and can be compared across a spectrum of
therapeutic interventions. Cost-utility analyses are,
thus, the preferred type of economic evaluation.33,34
Both costs and outcomes were discounted at 3%,
following the recommendation of Public Health Service Guidelines.34 The discount adjusts for the finding that current dollars and health benefits are worth
more than future dollars and health benefits.

Projecting Recurrence-free and Overall Survival
The first 5 years of distant-free recurrence and survival estimates were based on empirically fitting the
observed distributions for the first 4 years of the
reported trial data and extrapolating the trends to
the fifth year. Thus, assumptions were made about
the Markov transition probabilities during the first 4
years to attempt to reproduce the actual cumulative
results at 3 and 4 years, recognizing that exact reproduction is not possible, as background mortality is
an unobserved factor.
From 6 years onward, annual transition probabilities to recurrence and death were assumed to be the
same in both arms. Given the proportion of patients
in each of 3 health states (disease-free, distant recurrence, and death) at the end of 5 years, transition
rates to either recurrence or death were based on the
literature. Patients in each arm were assumed to progress to recurrence based on the rates observed in
the Early Breast Cancer Trialists’ Collaborative Group
2000 Report.28 Before recurrence, the probability of
dying (‘‘background mortality’’) was based on the
standard rate of mortality for a 50-year-old woman
in the US.35 After recurrence, it was assumed that
patients in both treatment arms would receive trastuzumab. The annual death rate for women with
metastatic breast cancer was assumed to be 32.3%, a
rate that produces the projected 2.1 years of overall
survival for women with metastatic breast cancer
treated with trastuzumab.27
Sensitivity Analyses
Robustness of results was assessed by using sensitivity analysis. Parameter values were varied across a
range of plausible values to determine the impact of
variation on the overall results. Sensitivities to
changes in individual parameters and to simultaneous, multiway changes were assessed.

apy is estimated to cost an additional $44,923, with
an expected gain of 1.70 QALYs (Table 2). Thus, the
incremental cost per QALY gained is $26,417. Without utility adjustment, the life-years gained would be
1.84 (13.72 years of discounted life expectancy for
patients receiving trastuzumab vs 11.88 years for
controls), and the cost per life-year gained would be
$24,435.
Over a 20-year horizon, treatment with trastuzumab is estimated to cost an additional $43,913 on average, with an expected gain of 1.28 QALYs. The
incremental cost per QALY gained is $34,201, and the
incremental cost per life-year gained is $32,361.

Societal perspective
From a societal perspective, the additional time and
travel expenses for the patient, a result of trastuzumab therapy duration that extends beyond that for
standard chemotherapy, is estimated to cost $2075
over a lifetime horizon. Accounting for this would
only increase the cost-effectiveness ratio to $27,637
per QALY gained (Table 2). This does, however,
ignore any indirect benefits in terms of improved
productivity or labor force attachment over the remainder of the patient’s working life.

extremes. The model estimates were most robust
with respect to variations in the costs of detecting
and treating cardiac events and the costs of diagnostic testing. This would suggest that the overall finding of a favorable cost-utility ratio, by usual
standards, is robust.

based on background mortality, recurrence rates, and
death after metastatic breast cancer assumptions. As
described above, the first 5 years of transition probabilities in the Markov model were empirically
derived to approximate the observed distribution
through 4 years and extended 1 additional year. A
conservative approach was taken by using a cumulative distant recurrence-free difference equal to 0.088
at 3 years versus 0.089, the actual difference, and by
using a cumulative overall survival difference of
0.020 projected versus 0.026 actual. Similarly, at the
end of 4 years, the differentials were 0.137 projected
versus 0.160 actual for recurrence and 0.041 projected versus 0.048 actual for overall survival. Adding
assumptions based on the literature from 6 years
onward, the incremental life expectancy in patients
receiving trastuzumab (area between the 2 curves) is
3.0 years (19.4 years vs 16.4 years). The absolute differential in survival increases from 4.1% at 4 years to
a maximum of 13.6% at 10 years and then reduces
thereafter, for example, to 9.7% at 20 years.

Sensitivity Analyses
One-way sensitivity analysis of key parameters is illustrated as a tornado diagram (Fig. 4). A multiway
analysis changing all parameters to either upperbound or lower-bound values produced a best-case
to worst-case range in the cost-utility ratio of $9104
to $69,340. The upper end of this range is reached
only when all parameters are set to the worst case, a
very unlikely scenario. The results were most sensitive to variations in the discount rate, the price of
trastuzumab, and the probability of metastasis. The
discount rate was varied from 0% to 5% at the

Compared with some other tumor types and latestage breast cancer, life expectancy for a 50-year-old
woman with early stage breast cancer is favorable—
approximately 15–20 years before discounting (see
Table 2). In this study, the projected lifetime cost per
QALY for the addition of trastuzumab to adjuvant
chemotherapy was estimated to be $26,417, a level
that is below that of many treatments commonly
used for oncology patients. This projection was
driven by substantial absolute advantages in clinical
outcomes that were observed with trastuzumab in
the joint analysis trial results: a 16.0 percentage-point
improvement in freedom from distant recurrence
and a 4.8 percentage-point improvement in overall
survival at 4 years.5 Although the base-case assumptions (13.7 and 4.1, respectively) were slightly more
conservative than these differences, these translate to
an average life expectancy gain of 3.0 years (19.4
years for chemotherapy plus trastuzumab vs 16.4
years for chemotherapy alone). It is clear that both
the difference in freedom from distant recurrence
and the difference in overall survival affect this
result. If only the differential in overall survival was
used to calculate average life expectancy gain, then
the mean gain would be smaller (4.8% 3 16.4 years,
approximately 0.8 years). Therefore, the extra 16
women per 100 who had not experienced a distant
recurrence by 4 years accounted for most of the 2.96
gain in undiscounted life years in the model.
Further support for the importance of preventing
recurrence by 4 years was provided by 1 of the sensitivity analyses for the model. If the differential in distant recurrence is forced to be 10.1% (instead of
14.0%), and the differential in overall survival is
reduced from 4.8% to 0.5%, the cost-utility ratio
increases to only $34,012. Although this is a 29%
increase, the overall cost-effectiveness finding is robust.
Although many may regard incremental discounted costs of approximately $45,000 as high, if
the projected long-term costs and outcomes are
achieved in the real world, then most observers
would view the resulting cost-utility ratio favorably.
The cost utility of adding trastuzumab to standard
chemotherapy is comparable to that of adjuvant

chemotherapy for colorectal cancer using oxaliplatin
in addition to 5-FU/leucovorin; a recent study projected a cost per QALY of $22,800.36 The use of hormonal therapy for early stage breast cancer is also
generally less than $100,000 per QALY gained.37–39
In 2 recently published analyses based on Markov models, Kurian and colleagues projected the cost
effectiveness of trastuzumab to be $39,982 per QALY,
and Liberato and colleagues projected it to be
$18,970.12,13 In the present study, the base-case estimate of $26,417 falls in between these, but closer to
the lower figure. A large part of the difference
between the estimates from this model and those
from Kurian et al. can be explained by the cost of
trastuzumab—$40,063 versus $50,767; their estimate
assumed 52 weeks of use based on protocol, whereas
the estimate in this study was based on the average
actual dose received in the trial. At the same time,
although both studies took a lifetime horizon for a
49 or 50-year old woman, Kurian et al’s projected differential in discounted QALYs was 1.42 versus 1.70 in
the present study. This difference between the 2 studies is despite the more conservative assumption
made in this analysis—that there is no additional
benefit of trastuzumab after Year 5. Presumably, this
is the result of differences in how the 2 models fit

the first 5 years of data and the hazard rates
assumed from Year 6 onward. Liberato et al. used a
15-year horizon in the base case, 52 weeks of trastuzumab treatment, and also assumed no additional
trastuzumab benefit after 5 years. Their projected
QALY differential was 1.18 QALYs, which was lower
than the estimate calculated here, due, in part, to the
shorter horizon. Liberato et al’s estimated discounted
cost differential over a 15-year horizon was $22,385
versus $44,923 over a lifetime horizon in this study.
Kurian et al. concluded that the incremental costeffectiveness ratio was comparable to other interventions, and Liberato et al. also concluded that—for
HER2-positive, high risk, early breast cancer—adjuvant trasutuzumab is a cost-effective therapy.
Other health economics studies have also predicted that adding trastuzumab to adjuvant chemotherapy is cost effective relative to other accepted
breast-cancer therapies.15–21 The methodologies and
assumptions used, and the geographic contexts, differ among the studies. Because healthcare programs
and funding vary among countries, conclusions
concerning what constitutes a cost-effective therapy
may differ between reports. Hillner and colleagues
estimated that, based on a 20-year horizon, the cost
per life-year gained for adjuvant trastuzumab would

be between $39,600 and $51,300.16 A Canadian study
reported an estimated additive cost of trastuzumab
of $0.6 million to $2.0 million (Canadian dollars) per
1000 new breast cancer cases per year.15 In the
United Kingdom, the National Institute for Health
and Clinical Excellence (NICE) estimates that adjuvant trastuzumab has an incremental cost per QALY
gained of £18,000 (approximately US $34,000), which
is less than the general £30,000 threshold that NICE
seems to apply in practice.21 A cost-effectiveness
analysis in Denmark has shown that, if indirect costs
are not included, the cost per life-year gained would
be DKK78,475 (approximately $14,000 in US dollars).20 A European study, based on therapy regimens
and results from the Breast Cancer International
Research Group 006 trial, predicted that trastuzumab
plus docetaxel after AC, or trastuzumab plus docetaxel and carboplatin would be cost effective provided long-term survival outcomes improved or drug
costs were reduced.19 It is important to note, however, that the comparative regimen in the BCIRG 006
cost-effectiveness analysis was 5-fluorouracil, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide (FEC)60, a regimen that
is not frequently used in the US and which is much
cheaper than AC plus a taxane. In addition, a 5% discount rate was used, compared with the 3% rate
used in this study.
The model used in this study is conservative in
that it assumes that both trastuzumab-containing
and control arms have equal efficacy from 6 years
onward. Also, the model assumes that patients will
receive trastuzumab upon disease recurrence or metastasis, which would tend to increase costs and
reduce cost effectiveness.
In a recent review of previous modeling efforts,
Norum argues that at least an 8% to 10% differential
in overall survival at 10 years is needed to produce
an acceptable cost-effectiveness ratio (E40,000 to
E60,000 per life-year gained).14 The base-case projection in our model is a difference in overall survival of
13.6% at 10 years. Thus, our results are consistent
with this hypothesis, producing a cost-effectiveness
ratio below the range cited. But, importantly, this
projection is based on an assumption that rates
of distant recurrence and death in both treatment
arms are the same after Year 5. Hence, the projection is likely to be conservative, and it appears to be
plausible.
The cost-effectiveness results from this study
were robust to sensitivity analysis. Multiway analysis
that examined the best-case and worse-case scenarios for utilities yielded a cost-utility ratio range of
$9104 to $69,340. This range would generally be considered as cost effective in a US setting because

many technologies in common use have higher
ratios, including the use of trastuzumab in HER2positive metastatic breast cancer.28 As the long-term
benefits of adjuvant trastuzumab are not yet known,
the source of our estimates for clinical outcomes
(disease-free survival and overall survival) were data
from the first 4 years of the NSABP B-31 and NCCTG
N9831 trials. These data were used in the Markov
model to predict the 20-year and lifetime survival
horizons.
The Markov model used in this study comprised
4 health states: treatment, disease-free, distant recurrence, and death. The disease states of contralateral
disease and local recurrence were not included in
the model, as we did not have reliable estimates of
differences between the control and trastuzumabcontaining treatment arms in the joint analysis of
NSABP B-31 and NCCTG N9831. Adding these states
to the model would have increased lifetime costs and
disutility in both arms. However, it is highly unlikely
that including these states would have had a significant impact on overall survival projections because
their effect is reflected in the time to distant recurrence estimates.
Cost-utility estimates from both a payer and a
partial societal perspective were included in this
analysis. The societal perspective accounted for the
indirect time and financial costs associated with
treatment. As a large proportion of patients with
early stage breast cancer are of working age, however, the indirect costs and productivity gains are
possibly substantial and have not been estimated in
this study or in the literature to date. Studies are
needed to address this gap.
Anthracyclines (such as doxorubicin) and trastuzumab are associated with an increased risk of cardiac dysfunction, particularly when administered
concomitantly.40,41 For this reason, the trastuzumab
portion of therapy was given after the AC-containing
regimen in the NSABP B-31 and NCCTG N9831 trials.
To estimate the rate of cardiac dysfunction in our
analysis, we used the average incidences of cardiac
events (NYHA class III or IV congestive heart failure
or probable or definite cardiac death) reported in the
NCCTG N9831 trial: 2.9% in the trastuzumab-containing arm versus 0% in the control arm. In both
NSABP B-31 and NCCTG N9831, the cardiac function
of most patients who experienced congestive heart
failure improved after they received standard medical
treatment.10,11 This finding also correlated with
recent reports by Ewer and colleagues, who reported
that cardiotoxicity associated with trastuzumab is reversible and not dose-related, and they showed that
trastuzumab treatment can often be continued or

Cost-Effectiveness of Adjuvant Trastuzumab/Garrison et al.

restarted in patients who develop cardiac dysfunction with no subsequent cardiac events.22,42 As a
result, an assumption in our analysis was that cardiac dysfunction associated with the addition of trastuzumab was at least partly reversible and would
have no direct impact on mortality beyond that
reflected in the 4-year trial period.
Determining HER2 status in all cases of breast cancer is recommended practice.43 HER2 test results (by
immunohistochemistry and/or FISH) were verified centrally in the NCCTG N9831 trial and by an approved laboratory in the NSABP B-31 trial. There can be a high
level of discordance between results from low-throughput local versus high-throughput reference laboratories,44,45 as observed in the NCCTG N9831 trial.44 The
methods used to test HER2 status, and whether results
need to be confirmed by reference laboratories, will
have an effect on overall diagnostic costs.
In conclusion, the addition of trastuzumab to
standard adjuvant therapy reduces risk of recurrence
and improves overall survival in patients with early
stage breast cancer. Over a lifetime, the use of trastuzumab in the adjuvant setting is projected to cost
$26,417 per QALY. This cost-effectiveness result is robust to sensitivity analysis. Trastuzumab for the adjuvant treatment of early stage breast cancer is
projected to be cost effective over a lifetime horizon,
achieving a cost-effectiveness ratio below that of
many widely accepted oncology treatments.
