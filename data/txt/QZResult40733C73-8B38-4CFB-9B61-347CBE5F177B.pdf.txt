BACKGROUND: Aggressive fibromatosis (AF) is a rare tumor of intermediate malignancy that has a strong potential
for local invasiveness and recurrence. To date, there are no general recommendations for the clinical management of
pediatric AF. METHODS: The authors retrospectively analyzed 94 patients aged 21 years, including 23 patients who
underwent complete surgery (Group I), 42 patients who underwent incomplete surgery with microscopic residual tumor (Group II), and 29 patients who underwent either biopsy or macroscopically incomplete surgery (Group III).
RESULTS: The 5-year event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival rates were 44% and 99%, respectively. Local recurrences developed in 22% of patients in Group I, in 76% of patients in Group II, and in 76% of patients in Group III. Two
of 7 patients with abdominal disease died of tumor progression, whereas none of the patients with extra-abdominal
AF died of their disease. Systemic treatment was given to 15 patients as first-line treatment and to 34 patients at
time the time they developed recurrent disease: The response rate was 47% in the former patients and 50% in the latter patients. Objective responses were observed in 11 of 19 patients who received combined methotrexate plus vinblastine/vinorelbine, in 7 of 15 patients who received alkylating-agent chemotherapy, and in 4 of 11 patients who
received other therapies (tamoxifen, sulindac, interferon alfa). CONCLUSIONS: The current analysis suggested that
the clinical course of AF in children may resemble that of AF in adults. Local recurrences did not affect the chance of
responding to systemic therapy or the survival rate. The completeness of initial resection was the main factor that
influenced EFS, whereas disease control after marginal resection was much the same as that achieved after intralesional surgery/biopsy. Good responses to systemic treatments, and particularly to low-dose chemotherapy, were

Aggressive fibromatosis (AF), also known as desmoid tumor, is a rare, deep-seated, muscoloaponeurotic tumor of
intermediate malignancy with an annual incidence of 0.2 to 0.4 per 100,000 population and with 2 relative peaks in incidence among individuals ages 6 years to 15 years and between puberty and age 40 years in women.1,2 AF is a fibroblastic
proliferation that has a monoclonal pattern arising from fascial planes and muscoloaponeurotic structures and a marked
local aggressiveness. Its growth may be fairly slow and can spread over several years. It has a strong tendency for local recurrence but does not metastasize to other organs like truly malignant tumors.3 The pathogenesis of AF is most likely multifactorial, and genetic predisposition, endocrine factors, and trauma may play some role in the causation of these lesions.
The incidence is higher in families with familial AF, familial adenomatous polyposis, and Gardner syndrome.4
The biologic and clinical patterns of AF in children generally are considered the same those in adults, and treatment
recommendations usually are similar. Surgery is the mainstay of treatment, but local recurrence rates after surgical resection range from 10% to 80%, when the margins are negative or positive, respectively; thus, additional therapies may be
indicated in some patients.5-8 Radiation therapy has a well established role in adult AF, but the associated, potentially

long-term cosmetic, functional morbidity and the risk of
developing second malignancies limits its use in children.9-11 Various alternative systemic strategies have been
explored, including the use of chemotherapy and noncytotoxic agents (ie, hormone therapy, anti-inflammatory
agents, interferon alfa [IFN-a]).12-15 Other open questions relating to treatment strategy concern the possibility
of a no-treatment approach for patients who have nonevolving disease and the search for prognostic indicators
for the purpose of patient risk stratification.16 To contribute new information on the clinical behavior and response
to treatment in childhood AF (because there are only
reports on small series), we analyzed 94 children and adolescents with AF and focused particularly on the role of
systemic treatment.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
The current study concerned a series of 94 consecutive
patients aged 21 years with a diagnosis of AF and
received treatment between 1970 and 2005. Sixty-seven
patients were treated at the National Cancer Institute in
Milan, Italy, and 27 patients were enrolled prospectively
onto 3 consecutive soft tissue sarcoma national protocols
that were coordinated by the Soft Tissue Sarcoma Committee of the Italian Association of Pediatric Hematologic
Oncology (the RMS-79, RMS-88, and RMS-96
protocols).
Full details (clinical data, treatment modalities, and
outcomes) were available for all patients and were
reviewed for this analysis. All patients or their guardians
provided their informed consent to enrolment in studies
according to the rules adopted over the years.
Initial tumor extent was assessed by ultrasound,
and/or computed tomography (CT), and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (CT scans and MRIs were available for most patients). Tumors were staged according to
the postsurgical Intergroup Rhabdomyosarcoma Study
(IRS) system used for pediatric rhabdomyosarcoma:
Patients in Group I are those who undergo complete tumor resection (histologically free margins), patients in
Group II are those who undergo resection with microscopic residual disease, and patients in Group III are those
who either undergo resection with macroscopic residual
disease or undergo only a biopsy.
Therapeutic strategies changed to some degree over
the years. In the first period of the study, local treatment
measures often were borrowed from those adopted for
truly malignant soft tissue tumors, whereas multidiscipli-

234

nary programs were adopted more recently. Adjuvant
treatments usually were not prescribed after a first gross
resection (some patients in Group II received postoperative radiotherapy). Most patients with who initially had
inoperable disease received various systemic therapies,
including: cytotoxic regimens with alkylating agents (like
those used in pediatric soft tissue sarcomas), such as combined vincristine, doxorubicin, ifosfamide, and actinomycin-D (VAIA), combined ifosfamide, vincristine, and
actinomycin-D (IVA), or combined vincristine, actinomycin-D, and cyclophosphamide (VAC); low-dose chemotherapy with methotrexate (MTX) (30 mg/m2) plus
either vinblastine (VBL) (6 mg/m2) or vinorelbine (VNB)
(20 mg/m2) delivered weekly by intravenous bolus infusion; hormone therapy (tamoxifen, 20 mg daily); antiinflammatory agents (diclofenac, 4 mg/kg daily); or IFNa. For chemotherapy, alkylating agent-based regimens
were used more before 1996; whereas, after the second
part of the 1990s, low-dose chemotherapy became the systemic treatment of choice.
A few patients received external beam irradiation
using megavoltage photon or electron beam energies and
conventional fractionation (1.8-2.0 grays [Gy] daily for 5
days a week for a total dose of 50-56 Gy). A wait-and-see
approach (consisting in radiologic and clinical evaluations
usually performed every 3 months to 4 months) was
chosen for some patients who had nonevolving disease,
especially in the latter years, to monitor patients until the
tumor began to progress (when systemic treatment was
recommended).
Response to therapy was assessed radiologically after
3 months of treatment and was defined as complete remission (CR) if the disease disappeared completely, partial
remission (PR) when a tumor reduction >50% of the
greatest tumor dimension was achieved, a minor response
(MR) when the maximal tumor reduction was >25% but
<50%, stable disease (SD) when the maximal tumor
reduction was <25% or when there was no tumor shrinkage after chemotherapy, and disease progression if the
tumor increased in size or new lesions were detected.
Statistical Methods
Event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) were
estimated according to the Kaplan-Meier method.
Patients were evaluated from the time of their histologic
diagnosis up to their latest uneventful follow-up or disease
progression, recurrence, or death from any cause for EFS,

and up to their death for OS. The log-rank test was used
to compare the survival curves for the different subgroups
of patients to establish the potential value of any prognostic factors. Patient follow-up ranged from 9 months to
420 months (median, 130 months).

RESULTS
Clinical Characteristics and Treatment
Table 1 summarizes the clinical findings, treatment
modalities, and outcomes for the 94 patients (44 males
and 50 females; ages from 1 month to 21 years; median
age, 10 years) divided into postsurgical groups. The most
common tumor sites were the extremities (38 patients)
and the head and neck region (31 patients), and 7 tumors
arose in the abdomen (3 patients had known Gardner
syndrome).
On the basis of the initial surgical approach, there
were 23 patients in Group I, 42 patients in Group II, and
29 patients in Group III. None of the Group I patients
received adjuvant treatment after surgery, whereas 5
Group II patients (with tumor size between 8 cm and 24
cm) received postoperative radiotherapy (50-56 Gy).
Twenty-nine patients were classified in Group III,
including 16 patients after a biopsy and 13 patients after
incomplete resection. Among them, 1 patient received
radiotherapy; 15 patients received systemic treatments, 9
of whom subsequently underwent delayed surgery (in 7
patients, after tumor shrinkage induced by front-line therapy); and 5 patients achieved histologically free margins.
One patient who was treated in 1978 had a large tumor of
the thigh, did not respond to chemotherapy, and underwent amputation.
Thirteen patients in Group III did not receive further treatment after their initial procedure (4 biopsies, 9
incomplete resections) and were observed until they developed disease progression. The 4 patients who were
observed with a wait-and-see approach after biopsy were
followed recently. Overall, a watchful-waiting strategy
was used in 4 Group III patients as the first approach (in
all 4 patients, tumor progression was observed thereafter
at 4 months, 8 months, 15 months, and 28 months), in 9
Group III patients after incomplete resection (tumor progression occurred in all 9 patients after 2-60 months; median time to progression, 6 months after first surgery),
and in 16 patients who had evidence of disease after
receiving systemic therapy either in the front-line setting
or at the time of disease recurrence. Among those
16 patients, 13 did not have further tumor growth and

had SD at the time of this analysis 9 to 90 months after
diagnosis (median, 48 months), and 3 patients had local
progression after 2 to 16 months).
Outcome
For the series as a whole, the 5-year EFS and OS rates
were 44% and 99%, respectively. At the time of the current analysis, 61 patients were without evidence of disease,
and 29 patients had evidence of tumor, including 26
patients with SD 9 to 90 months after diagnosis and 3
patients with progressive disease. Four patients died,
including 2 patients who died because of tumor progression (both had Gardner syndrome, including 1 patient
who initially was in Group II and 1 patient in Group III)
and 2 patients from causes unrelated to their tumor.
Among the 23 patients in Group I, 5 patients (22%)
had a local recurrence. In 4 of those 5 patients, the initial
tumor had been >5 cm in size, and it involved the limbs
in 3 patients. At time of recurrence, all 5 patients underwent another operation; 4 patients achieved histologically
free margins, and 1 patient had microscopically suspected
residual disease. All of these patients were alive with no
evidence of disease at the time of this analysis.
Among the 42 patients in Group II, 32 patients
(76%) had a local recurrence, including 4 of 5 patients
who received radiotherapy as first-line treatment (all of
whom had very large tumors at diagnosis). At the time of
recurrence, 11 patients underwent surgery alone (9 underwent complete surgery), 9 patients underwent surgery and
received radiotherapy, 4 patients received radiotherapy
only, 5 patients received systemic therapies, 2 patients
received systemic therapies followed by resection, and 1
patient was observed with a wait-and-see approach. Overall, 22 patients underwent a second surgery (13 patients
achieved complete excisions, 8 patients had microscopically suspected residual tumor, and 1 patient had macroscopic residual tumor) (Table 1).
Among the 29 patients in Group III, 22 patients
(76%) developed a local recurrence. The 7 patients who
did not develop recurrent disease had received first-line
systemic treatment, and 6 of those 7 patients had undergone delayed surgery. All patients who had a wait-and-see
strategy after surgery developed recurrent disease (time to
disease progression: range, 2-60 months; median, 6
months). At the time of recurrence, 7 patients underwent
surgery alone, 4 patients underwent surgery and received
radiotherapy, 1 patient received radiotherapy alone, 4
patients received systemic treatments, and 6 patients
received systemic therapies followed by surgery. Overall,

17 patients underwent another surgery (11 patients

evidence of residual tumor, and 3 patients had macroscopic residual tumor); 1 patient had an amputation.
Table 2 shows the 5-year EFS rates by different clinical variables. The EFS rate differed significantly in relation to IRS grouping; ie, the EFS rate was 72% for Group
I, 28% for Group II, and 35% for Group III. A trend toward a better outcome was observed for males, for
younger patients, for patients who had head-neck lesions,
and for patients who had tumors <5 cm in size.

underwent marginal resection, developed a local recurrence 12 months later, then underwent a second surgery,
and was in remission at the time of the current analysis,
280 months after diagnosis. Five patients were treated
with a combination of chemotherapy, surgery, and radiotherapy: Two of those patients were alive with SD at 18
months and 50 months, 1 patient was in second remission
at 120 months, and 2 patients died of tumor progression
(both with Gardner syndrome).

Morbidity
Data on morbidity were available for 64 patients. Among
them, 43 patients reportedly had no major functional or
cosmetic iatrogenic sequelae. Five patients underwent
amputation. Eight patients had functional impairment (4
after surgery and 4 after surgery plus radiotherapy), 1
patient had postirradiation pathologic bone fracture, and
1 patient had postirradiation facial growth retardation.
Tissue fibrosis and/or lymphedema related to radiotherapy were reported in 6 patients. No late effects related to
systemic therapies were reported.

first-line chemotherapy or other systemic treatments, 5
patients had a PR, 2 patients had an MR, 7 patients had
SD, and 1 patient had progressive disease for a 47%
response rate (PRs plus MRs).
Among 30 patients who received systemic therapy
after they developed recurrent disease (17 received systemic therapy as second-line therapy, and 13 patients
received it as third-line therapy), 3 patients had a CR, 11
patients had a PR, 1 patient had an MR, 10 patients had
SD, and 5 patients had tumor progression for a response
rate of 50%. The situation differed according to whether
this second-line or third-line therapy was administered after first-line surgery with or without radiotherapy (11
patients; objective response rate, 63%) or after patients
also had received some kind of first-line systemic treatment (19 patients; objective response rate, 27%). For the
various therapies that were adopted, the response rate was
47% (2 CRs, 5 PRs, 6 patients with SD, 2 patients with
disease progression) for patients who received chemotherapy with alkylating agents (VAIA, IVA, VAC) and 58%
(1 CR, 9 PRs, 1 MR, 8 patients with SD, no patients with
progressive disease) for low-dose chemotherapy (MTX
plus VBL or VNR). Other treatments (ie, hormones or
anti-inflammatory agents) seemed to be less effective.

DISCUSSION
No general guidelines are available on the management of
pediatric AF based on studies in large cohorts. A recently
published, comprehensive literature review collected only
187 pediatric patients from 10 different studies and, to
our knowledge, only 1 prospective phase 2 study has been
published to date (conducted by the Pediatric Oncology
Group and based on the use of MTX plus VBL chemotherapy in 26 children with recurrent/inoperable AF).17,18
Therefore, we believe that our study represents the
largest series to date of AF in children and adolescents.
First, our results suggest that AF in children has much the
same clinical course and natural history as in adults: at
extra-abdominal sites, AF is a slow-growing disease with a
marked tendency for local recurrence but with a very low
risk of affecting survival. Our study highlighted that local
recurrence did not affect the patient’s chances of responding to systemic therapy or of survival. The natural history
of abdominal desmoid tumors may be different, however,
and patients who have Gardner syndrome probably
should be considered separately from patients who have
extra-abdominal AF.
In our pediatric cohort, we confirmed the finding already reported in adult series of relatively high
rates of response to systemic treatment. Significant tumor shrinkage was recorded after classic cytotoxic
chemotherapy (like that used to treat soft tissue sarcomas) and after the less toxic, low-dose chemotherapy
regimens with MTX plus VBL or VNB. Therapeutic
responses also were observed after alternative noncytotoxic drugs, such as antiestrogens or nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs. Tumors also responded not only
to first-line systemic therapies but also to second-line
and third-line treatments (although the responses were
less marked when a patient already had received some
kind of systemic therapy). The best outcome in

patients who initially were considered unresectable was
achieved in those who received effective systemic treatment followed by delayed surgery. Moreover, large
numbers of patients achieved tumor growth stabilization with chemotherapy, and it is noteworthy that
several patients who achieved a PR but even SD after
chemotherapy continued with nonevolving disease for
a long time after they had discontinued all therapy.
The availability of relatively effective drugs is shifting the focus on AF treatment from a strategy of aggressive
surgery to a multidisciplinary approach that also takes
into account the functional and cosmetic sequelae of treatments.19-25 Studies in adult AF have reported functionsparing surgery as their primary objective and suggested
that, to reduce the risk of major sequelae, marginal surgery
may be acceptable.26-29 Our series revealed a high local recurrence rate after incomplete surgery; however, disease
control was no better in Group II than in Group III. In
principle, our findings suggest that primary surgery
should only be attempted if it can be complete (ie, if it can
achieve histologically negative margins), and nonmutilating excisions are naturally feasible; otherwise, neoadjuvant
systemic treatment should be recommended. Several
observations from the adult literature that desmoid
tumors can remain stable for a long time, with or without
primary treatment, prompt the suggestion that a ‘‘waitand-see’’ approach (clinical/radiologic monitoring alone)
may be suitable for patients who have nonevolving disease, and therapies should be given only in the event of tumor growth.23,27-29
Systemic treatment, and particularly low-dose
chemotherapy, may play a significant role in the treatment
of locally advanced disease; however, the role for adjuvant
chemotherapy remains unclear. Although others have
reported some benefits,17 no useful information emerged
from our series on its role for patients in Group II.
Concerning radiotherapy, in the small subset of
Group II patients who received postoperative irradiation,
this did not lead to better local control (but that result
may have been related to the large tumor size in patients
who received irradiation). Data from the literature (in
particular, the series from St. Jude Children’s Research
Hospital) suggest that desmoid tumors in children are
likely to recur despite radiation therapy. These and our
findings are in contrast with the effectiveness of radiotherapy reported in adult series.30 The possible reasons for
these different results are unclear and may be only objects
of speculation (ie, more infiltrative pattern of AF in children than in adults, different biology, or different

aggressiveness of pediatric vs adult radiotherapists). In
fact, the use of radiotherapy needs to be limited in children because of the greater risk of iatrogenic sequelae
(functional morbidity and second malignancies) than in
adults, and it probably deserves a role only in certain situations, ie, after chemotherapy has failed in patients with
unresectable disease, in the event of progression despite
multiple surgeries, or as an alternative to mutilating surgery. The possible role of new radiotherapy technologies—such as intensity-modulated radiation therapy or
proton therapy—however, may be explored in the near
future and may change the decision process about radiotherapy for patients with pediatric AF.
Finally, there remains the question of whether prognostic indicators can be identified for the risk stratification
of pediatric patients with AF, like those that have been
identified in pediatric soft tissue sarcomas. In our study,
the completeness of initial resection (IRS group) was identified as the main factor that influenced EFS. However, a
precise stratification that points to risk-adapted treatments seems applicable less readily to desmoid tumors
than to truly malignant mesenchymal neoplasms. The
particular natural history of AF suggests that we should
take another approach to measuring outcome—not just
in terms of EFS but as a combination of survival rates,
total burden of therapy and functional/cosmetic iatrogenic sequelae. The clinical management of patients with
AF often needs to be customized. It is difficult to establish
a treatment flowchart based, for instance, on factors like
IRS group and tumor size; because individual, less easily
quantified variables may have a significant impact both on
the risk of failure and on the functional fallout (including
the patient’s age and the tumor’s location, not in terms of
anatomic site but in terms of its interaction with adjacent
anatomic structures and even the surgeon’s experience).
Similar to the treatment algorithm recently proposed by
Hosalkar et al, asymptomatic and stable desmoid lesions
may be observed (‘‘wait-and-see’’ strategy), whereas treatment should be suggested only for progressing and/or
symptomatic disease, ie, either surgery only for easily resectable (with minimal morbidity) tumors or, alternatively,
low-dose chemotherapy (‘‘minimal morbidity medical
treatment’’), in particular MTX plus VBL or VNB.
What is the objective of systemic therapy in AF? In
malignant tumors, the aim of chemotherapy is tumor
shrinkage that can permit subsequent resection; in AF,
recent findings suggest that chemotherapy may play a
major role in inducing growth arrest and tumor stabilization in a such slowly evolving disease for which neither the

Cancer

complete remission of the tumor nor the survival rate
should be the endpoints. Repeated resections or destructive surgery should be avoided as a general rule.31 The role
of postoperative irradiation remains uncertain in pediatric
patients. The management of patients who have microscopic residual disease after maximal surgery is not established. Because no data are available on the role of
adjuvant chemotherapy, observation probably remains
the most appropriate suggestion. A better understanding
of the tumor’s biology and the identification of any molecular determinants of AF outcome (ie, mutations of the
gene that encodes b-catenin) soon may enable the biologic
stratification of patients with AF, thus suggesting a more
accurate choice of treatment.32
For investigators who are working on pediatric soft
tissue sarcomas and, thus, also on pediatric AF, primary
objectives in the coming years should be to establish closer
forms of international cooperation between pediatric oncology groups, to develop prospective clinical trials tailored to AF, and to standardize the treatment of AF based
on a minimally aggressive strategy. Closer cooperation
with adult medical oncology groups and with translational research also is warranted to improve our knowledge of this disease.
