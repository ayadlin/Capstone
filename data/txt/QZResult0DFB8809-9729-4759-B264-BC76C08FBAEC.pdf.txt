pathways. Given their role in cellular proliferation, many of these
prosurvival pathways actually play important roles during development, including the Notch pathway, which is increasingly being
studied as a novel mechanism for tumorigenesis (reviewed by
refs. 1, 2). Although originally found to be overexpressed in T-cell
leukemias through an oncogenic translocation, the Notch pathway
has now been shown to be activated in multiple tumors, including
colon cancers (3). Further contributing to oncogenesis, activation
of the Notch pathway induces prosurvival signals that have been
associated with resistance to chemotherapy (4). However, the
relationship between Notch activation and sensitivity of tumor
cells to cytotoxic agents in colon cancer has not been examined.
Notch signaling could contribute to chemoresistance by protecting
the cell from apoptosis, as it activates targets involved in cellular
survival, such as phosphoinositide kinase-3 (PI3K)/Akt (5–7),
Bcl-XL (7), and survivin (8). Consequently, activation of Notch-1
may increase chemoresistance, as overexpression of Notch-1
increases the resistance of T cells to etoposide (7), breast cancers
to melphalan and mitoxantrone (9), cervical cancers to doxorubicin
(5), and lung cancers to cisplatin and paclitaxel (4).
The activation of the Notch pathway occurs when specific
ligands like Jagged-1 (JAG-1) or Delta-like-3 (DLL3) bind to four
related transmembrane receptors, Notch-1 through Notch-4. This
binding activates the g-secretase protein complex, composed of
four subunits: presenilin (PS1), nicastrin (NCT), anterior pharynxdefective (APH-1), and presenilin enhancer-2 (PEN-2). g-Secretase
then cleaves the Notch-1 receptor in the transmembrane domain to
release the cytoplasmic portion known as the Notch-1 intracellular
domain (NICD). After translocating into the nucleus, the NICD
binds three cofactors, CSL (CBF-1/suppressor of hairless/Lag-1),
MAML-1 (mastermind-like-1), and p300/CBP, to create a complex
that acts as a transcriptional coactivator. Notch signaling then
induces the expression of multiple targets involved in cellular
proliferation, such as cyclin D1 (10) and c-Myc (11), and in cellular
survival, as discussed. Overexpression of the Notch receptors
and/or their ligands has now been identified in multiple cancers,
including breast (12), ovarian (13), prostate (14), brain (15), and
sarcoma (16, 17). Finally, overexpression of Notch elements in
tumors is correlated with poor clinical outcome. For example,
overexpression of Notch-1 has been associated with decreased time
to recurrence in breast cancers (18), and increased expression of
JAG-1 is associated with higher rates of recurrence in prostate
cancers (14).
Consequently, multiple groups have studied the effects of
inhibiting Notch signaling by targeting the g-secretase protein
complex, which cleaves the Notch receptor to activate the pathway
(reviewed by ref. 2). It was first shown that inhibition of the

Abstract
Because Notch signaling is implicated in colon cancer
tumorigenesis and protects cells from apoptosis by inducing
prosurvival targets, it was hypothesized that inhibition of
Notch signaling with ;-secretase inhibitors (GSI) may enhance
the chemosensitivity of colon cancer cells. We first show that
the Notch-1 receptor, as well as its downstream target Hes-1,
is up-regulated with colon cancer progression, similar to
other genes involved in chemoresistance. We then report that
chemotherapy induces Notch-1, as oxaliplatin, 5-fluorouracil
(5-FU), or SN-38 (the active metabolite of irinotecan) induced
Notch-1 intracellular domain (NICD) protein and activated
Hes-1. Induction of NICD by oxaliplatin was caused by an
increase in the activity and expression of ;-secretase complex,
as suppression of the protein subunit nicastrin with small
interfering RNA (siRNA) prevented NICD induction after
oxaliplatin. Subsequent inhibition of Notch-1 signaling with
a sulfonamide GSI (GSI34) prevented the induction of NICD by
chemotherapy and blunted Hes-1 activation. Blocking the
activation of Notch signaling with GSI34 sensitized cells to
chemotherapy and was synergistic with oxaliplatin, 5-FU, and
SN-38. This chemosensitization was mediated by Notch-1, as
inhibition of Notch-1 with siRNA enhanced chemosensitivity
whereas overexpression of NICD increased chemoresistance.
Down-regulation of Notch signaling also prevented the
induction of prosurvival pathways, most notably phosphoinositide kinase-3/Akt, after oxaliplatin. In summary, colon
cancer cells may up-regulate Notch-1 as a protective mechanism in response to chemotherapy. Therefore, combining GSIs
with chemotherapy may represent a novel approach for
treating metastatic colon cancers by mitigating the development of chemoresistance. [Cancer Res 2009;69(2):573–82]

Introduction
Although significant advances have occurred in the treatment of
metastatic colorectal cancers with the introduction of novel
chemotherapies and targeted agents, the overall survival rate
remains low, as metastatic cancers eventually develop resistance
to standard treatments through the activation of prosurvival tumor

g-secretase complex suppresses the growth of T cell ALL lines,
which leads to apoptosis (19). g-Secretase inhibitors (GSI) have
now been used to inhibit the growth of multiple tumors, including
sarcoma (16), medulloblastoma (15), and breast cancer (18).
Therefore, because of the role that Notch signaling plays in
chemoresistance, it was hypothesized that inhibition of Notch-1
may sensitize colon cancer cells to chemotherapy. Although
previous groups have reported that GSI treatment can enhance
the apoptotic effect of taxanes in colon cancers (20) and of
doxorubicin and melphalan in multiple myeloma cells (21), we now
report for the first time that the Notch-1 pathway is actually
activated in colon cancer cells, in response to chemotherapy, as a
novel mechanism to increase chemoresistance. Down-regulation of
Notch-1 signaling with GSIs sensitizes colon cancer cells to
chemotherapy, whereas overexpression of NICD increases chemoresistance. We then report that the mechanism for this potentiation
of chemosensitivity by Notch inhibition may be related to downregulation of prosurvival pathways. Therefore, we propose that
inhibition of Notch-1 signaling may be a novel strategy to increase
the sensitization of colon cancer cells to chemotherapy.

and JAG-1 (JAG-1h and JAG-1h2) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, nicastrin
from Santa Cruz and Sigma Chemical Company, and Akt1/Akt2 from Cell
Signaling and Sigma. Four commercially available siRNA to random
noncoding sequences (control siRNA-A, siRNA-B, siRNA-C, and siRNA-D)
were used for control transfections (Santa Cruz).
Protein immunoblot assays. Cell lines were treated with oxaliplatin
(0.5 or 1 Amol/L), SN-38 (2–20 nmol/L), or 5-FU (1–10 Amol/L), combined
with either GSI34 (1–10 Amol/L) or 0.1% DMSO (as a control) for 24 to 48 h.
Total protein lysates were prepared. For isolation of nuclear and
cytoplasmic fractions, the Pierce NE-PER extraction kit was used. Proteins
were probed with the following primary antibodies: Notch-1, cyclin D1, and
Hes-1 (all from Santa Cruz); NICD, phosphorylated AktSer473, Akt, DNAdependent protein kinase (DNA-PK), mammalian target of rapamycin
(mTOR), phosphorylated S6Ser235/Ser236 ribosomal protein, total S6 ribosomal protein, nicastrin, cyclin D1, and presenilin (all from Cell Signaling); and
survivin and Bcl-XL (Pharmingen-BD Biosciences). The antibody to Notch-1
(Santa Cruz) is directed to an epitope at the COOH terminus, so it detects
both the full-length and the cleaved cytoplasmic portions of Notch-1. The
antibody to NICD (Cell Signaling) specifically probes for the cytosolic
domain of Notch-1 when cleaved between Gly1743 and Val1744. Equal
protein loading was confirmed by probing for a/h-tubulin expression (Cell
Signaling). Appropriate secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish
peroxidase were used, including antimouse or antirabbit IgG (GE-Healthcare), and proteins were visualized with Amersham enhanced chemiluminescence (GE-Healthcare). Films were digitized with a Microtek scanner,
and images were processed with Photoshop software (Adobe).
Hes-1 luciferase assays. Cell lines were cotransfected with pGL2-Hes-1
luciferase reporter (1 Ag/well) and the Renilla reporter pRL-CMV (0.1 Ag/well)
using Fugene (Roche). After 8 to 12 h, cells were treated with oxaliplatin
(0.5 or 1 Amol/L), GSI34 (10 Amol/L), or both drugs for 48 h. Cells were
also treated with SN-38 (2 or 20 nmol/L), 5-FU (1 or 8 Amol/L), GSI34
(10 Amol/L) alone, or the combination of GSI34 with SN-38 or 5-FU for
48 h. After 6, 12, 24, or 48 h of drug treatment, total cell lysates were harvested
using the dual-reporter luciferase assay kit (Stop-and-Glo, Promega), and
luciferase activity was quantified on a luminometer (Turner Design).
Luciferase values were standardized by Renilla pRL-CMV cotransfection.
Clonogenicity assays. Cell lines, in a single-cell suspension, were plated
and treated for 48 h with oxaliplatin (0.5–2 Amol/L), GSI34 (10 Amol/L), or
both drugs. Drug-containing media were then removed, and the cells were
allowed to grow for a minimum of 2 wk to form colonies. Colonies were
stained with 0.01% crystal violet (Sigma) and quantified in an automated
colony counter (ColCount, Oxford-Optronics).
Apoptosis assays. Apoptosis was assessed by quantitative confocal
fluorescence microscopy. Briefly, after drug treatment, cells were fixed in 4%
paraformaldehyde and stained with 4’-6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI;
Sigma). Cells with fragmented nuclei under confocal fluorescence microscopy (magnification, 40) were measured as apoptotic. A total of 500 nuclei
from five different high-power fields were assessed for each condition.
Viability assays. HCT116 cells were plated in 96-well plates and treated
with GSI34 (0–40 Amol/L), oxaliplatin (0–2 Amol/L), or both drugs for 24
to 72 h. Viability was assessed with the sulforhodamine B (SRB) assay.
Briefly, after drug treatment, cells were stained with 0.4% SRB (Sigma), fixed
with 10% trichloroacetic acid, washed with 1% acetic acid, and solubilized
in 10 mmol/L Tris buffer, and absorbance was measured at 490 nmol/L on a
spectrophotometer (SpectraMax, Molecular Devices).
Transfection of siRNA. Cell lines were transfected with siRNA for
Notch-1 (Santa Cruz) at 60 pmol/L or with siRNA for Akt (Cell Signaling) at
50 nmol/L using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen). Cells were also transfected
with control siRNA consisting of random sequences (Santa Cruz) at
60 pmol/L. For protein immunoblotting, total cell lysates were harvested
at 48 h. For Hes-1 luciferase assays, cells were first transfected with the
Hes-1 luciferase reporter for 12 h and were then transfected with siRNA
(Notch-1, Akt, or control) for 48 h. For colony formation assays, cells were
transfected with siRNA for 12 h and then oxaliplatin (0.5–2 Amol/L), SN-38
(0.2–20 nmol/L), or the medium was added for 48 h. Colonies were stained
after 14 d. Serial transfections were done to limit any potential cytotoxicity
and to standardize transfection procedures in all experiments.

Materials and Methods
Microarray data analysis. Gene chip microarrays were performed on 308
normal and malignant colon tissues obtained at the time of surgical resection,
including normal colon mucosa (10%), colonic polyps (15%), primary colon
cancers (55%), liver metastases (13%), and lung metastases (6%), using
Affymetrix U133A arrays (Affymetrix). Data preprocessing and statistical
analysis were carried out in R6 and Bioconductor.7 The expression intensities
were normalized using the robust multiarray average method (22), which
includes background adjustment, quantile normalization across arrays, and
probe level expression measure summarization using median polish on the
log2 scale, for each probe set. Differential expression analysis was performed
to identify putative genes between sample groups. An empirical Bayes t test
was applied to each gene (23), as a P value cutoff of 0.01 was used to select
differentially expressed genes (P V 0.01). The following sample groups were
compared, respectively: normal mucosa versus primary polyp versus primary
colon cancer, primary tumor stage I versus stage II versus stage III versus
stage IV, and primary tumor versus liver metastasis.
Cell lines. The human colon adenocarcinoma cell lines HCT116, SW620,
SW480, HT29, and LS513 (American Type Culture Collection, ATCC) were
maintained in McCoy’s 5a medium (HCT116, HT29), Leibovitz’s L-15
(SW480, SW620), or RPMI 1640 (LS513), as recommended by ATCC.
Cultures were supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum
and penicillin-streptomycin (100 units/mL) or 2 mmol/L L-glutamine
(SW480, SW620). All cell lines were maintained at 37jC in 5% carbon
dioxide and were tested to rule out Mycoplasma contamination.
Drugs. GSI34, a sulfonamide analogue, was derived from GSIs, as
described (24). GSI34 was dissolved in DMSO, stored at 20j C, and diluted
in media before use so that the final concentration of DMSO was 0.1% or
less in all experiments. The drugs oxaliplatin (Sanofi-Aventis) and 5-FU
(Pharmacia) were obtained from the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer
Center Research Pharmacy. SN-38, the active metabolite of irinotecan, was
generously provided by Dr. J. Patrick McGovren ( formerly at Pharmacia and
Upjohn). Drugs were used at concentrations equal to or less than the IC50
specific to each cell line.
Constructs and small interfering RNA. The pGL2-Hes-1-luciferase and
pCS2-NICD constructs were generously provided by Dr. Raffi Kopan
(Washington University). The pGL2 and Renilla vectors were obtained from
Promega. At least two different small interfering RNA (siRNA) sequences to
each of the following genes were used: Notch-1 (Notch-1h and Notch-1h2)

Oxaliplatin Induces Notch-1 Signaling in Colon Cancers

Figure 1. Overexpression of Notch-1 in colon cancer progression. A, in a microarray analysis of genes that are overexpressed during colon cancer progression from
primary tumors to metastatic liver lesions, we identified several known chemoresistance genes, including BCL2 (bcl-2), BIRC5 (survivin), and CCND1 (cyclin D1),
but also a novel target usually involved in developmental signaling, NOTCH1. The expression level of NOTCH1 is enhanced in metastatic lesions (stage IV primary
and liver metastases) compared with normal colon mucosa or liver parenchyma. In contrast, a related Notch receptor, NOTCH2 , is not increased in expression
during colon cancer progression. Data are shown as box plots of mean relative gene expression F SD. B, HES1 , a downstream transcriptional target of Notch-1, is also
overexpressed during colon cancer stage progression, whereas the expression of a negative Notch regulator, NUMB , which binds the NICD and prevents its
translocation into the nucleus, is suppressed in advanced colon cancers. C, expression of the Notch-1 ligands JAG1 (left) and DLL3 (right ) is not increased during colon
cancer progression.

Transfection of NICD. Colon cancer cell lines were transfected with
pCS2-NICD (0.5–2 Ag) or pCS2 vector (0.5–2 Ag). To confirm protein
expression of NICD, total cell lysates were harvested after 24 to 48 h for
immunoblotting. For luciferase experiments, the HES-1 luciferase reporter
was transfected for 12 h, and the cells were then transfected with NICD for
48 h. For colony formation assays, cells were transfected with NICD for 48 h,
the medium was removed, and colonies were allowed to grow for 14 d.
;-Secretase assays. The activity of the g-secretase protein was measured
using a modified in vitro assay, as previously published (25). In brief, cell lines
were treated with oxaliplatin or transfected with control siRNA (random
sequences) or siRNA targeting niastrin, as described above. Cell membranes
were then solubilized with CHAPSO detergent (Sigma) to generate the
catalytically active g-secretase complex. Enzyme activity was then measured
by incubating the solubilized protein complex with a recombinant substrate
of g-secretase, and target cleavage was detected by chemiluminescence with
antibodies against the protein fragments.
Biostatistical analysis. All experiments were conducted in duplicate
and were repeated at least twice. Statistical significance was analyzed with
Student’s t test (P < 0.05).

cancer development, we analyzed the expression of Notch genes,
along with known chemoresistance genes, in progressive stages of
colon cancers. Gene chip microarrays were performed from 308
normal and malignant colon tissues obtained at surgical resection,
including normal colon mucosa (10%), colonic polyps (15%),
primary colon cancers (55%), or liver metastases (13%), using
Affymetrix U133A arrays. Correlation analysis identified genes
differentially expressed between sample classes among a list of 44
genes related to the Notch pathway (Supplementary Fig. S1). The
expression of NOTCH1 increased from normal colon mucosa to
stage IV metastatic cancers with levels being highest in liver
metastases compared with normal colonic mucosa or liver
parenchyma (trend test, P < 0.001; Fig. 1A). In contrast, NOTCH2
did not similarly increase with disease progression, disproving the
null hypothesis that there is a difference in NOTCH2 expression
with disease progression (P > 0.001; Fig. 1A). The pattern of
NOTCH1 overexpression mirrored that of other genes involved in
chemoresistance, including BCL2, BIRC5 or survivin, and CCND1 or
cyclin D1 (Fig. 1A). BIRC5 is not significantly associated with
colon cancer disease progression, whereas CCND1 tends to be
up-regulated as disease progresses (P < 0.001). In addition,
the expression of the downstream target HES1, a target gene of

induced Hes-1 activity in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2A,
bottom). The effect was not limited to these two lines, as oxaliplatin
also increased Hes-1 activity in three other colon cancer lines,
HT29 with mutant p53, LS513 with wild-type p53, and SW480 with
mutant p53 (Fig. 2B). We then examined if the increase in NICD by
oxaliplatin activated the Notch pathway by measuring downstream
targets. In HCT116 cells, oxaliplatin induced Hes-1 protein, as
suggested by the luciferase data, as well as the Notch-1 targets
cyclin D1 and survivin (Fig. 2C). Finally, it was determined if other
chemotherapies used to treat metastatic colon cancer can also
activate Notch signaling. Both the antifolate 5-fluorouracil (5-FU),
a pyrimidine analogue, and SN-38, the active metabolite of the
topoisomerase I inhibitor irinotecan, increased Hes-1 activity
(Fig. 2D).
Oxaliplatin induces ;-secretase protein complex activity
and expression. We then examined the possible mechanism
underlying the induction of NICD protein by chemotherapy. NICD
is produced when the Notch-1 receptor is cleaved by the gsecretase complex; therefore, we hypothesized that chemotherapy
induced NICD protein by increasing g-secretase activity. First, we
measured the activity of the enzyme complex after oxaliplatin
treatment using an in vitro assay that uses a fluorescent-tagged
substrate of g-secretase. In two colon cancer cell lines, HCT116
(Fig. 3A, left) and HT29 (Fig. 3A, right), oxaliplatin treatment

Notch-1, increased with colon cancer progression (Fig. 1B, left),
and there is moderate correlation with NOTCH1 (correlation
coefficient = 0.29, P < 0.001). In contrast, NUMB, a negativeregulator of Notch-1, is down-regulated in advanced colon cancers
(P < 0.001; Fig. 1B, right). Finally, the genes for the Notch ligands
JAG1 (Fig. 1C, left) and DLL3 (Fig. 1C, right) are not increased with
colon cancer progression.
Oxaliplatin induces NICD protein and activity. Because
Notch-1 expression is increased with colon cancer progression,
we hypothesized that it may play a role in chemoresistance. First,
we examined if Notch-1 signaling is affected by chemotherapy by
treating colon cancer cells with oxaliplatin, a platinum-derived
chemotherapy drug that damages DNA through the formation of
DNA adducts. In two colon cancer cell lines, HCT116 and SW620,
oxaliplatin induced NICD protein in a dose-dependent manner
(Fig. 2A, top, first row), whereas it slightly decreased the expression
of full-length Notch-1 protein (Fig. 2A, top, middle row). The
induction was independent of p53 status, as HCT116 has wild-type
p53 and SW620 has mutant p53. It was then examined if the
increase in NICD protein could augment Notch-1 signaling by
measuring the activity of a downstream target, HES1. HCT116 and
SW620 cells were transfected with a luciferase construct containing
the promoter of HES1 and were then treated with oxaliplatin. In
both cell lines, similar to the induction of NICD protein, oxaliplatin

Figure 2. Oxaliplatin induces NICD protein and activity. A, the transcriptionally active NICD protein, but not full-length Notch-1 protein, increases with oxaliplatin in a
dose-dependent manner in two colon cancer cell lines HCT116 and SW620 (top ). The two cell lines were treated with oxaliplatin for 48 h, and total protein was
immunoblotted for NICD or full-length Notch-1. Equal protein loading was confirmed by probing for tubulin. Next, using a luciferase reporter containing the promoter of
the Notch-1 target HES-1 , we report that oxaliplatin induces Hes-1 transcriptional activity in both colon cancer cell lines (bottom ). All values were normalized for
transfection efficiency. Columns, percentage of the untreated controls; bars, SE. B, Hes-1 luciferase activity was assayed in a panel of colon cancer cell lines after
treatment with oxaliplatin (1 or 2 Amol/L) for 48 h. A statistically significant dose-dependent increase in Hes-1 luciferase activity was observed in each cell line. All values
are standardized to the vehicle-treated group for each cell line. C, in HCT116 cells, the induction of NICD protein by oxaliplatin also increases the expression of
downstream targets of Notch-1, including Hes1, cyclin D1, and survivin. Equal protein loading was shown by probing for a-tubulin protein expression. D, both the 5-FU
(left) and SN-38, the active metabolite of irinotecan (right panel), increase the transcriptional activity of a Hes-1 luciferase reporter in HCT116 cells. All values were
normalized for transfection efficiency. Columns, percentage of the untreated controls; bars, SE.

Oxaliplatin Induces Notch-1 Signaling in Colon Cancers

Figure 3. Oxaliplatin induces g-secretase protein expression. A, oxaliplatin treatment (0.5 Amol/L) for 48 h (gray columns ) of HCT116 cells (left) or HT29 cells
(right ) induces the activity of the g-secretase protein complex, as measured with an in vitro substrate assay. Cotreatment with GSI34 (black columns ) abrogates
this induction of g-secretase activity. Values are normalized to each cell line treated with media only. Columns, percentage of the untreated controls; bars, SE. B, in
HCT116 colon cancer cells, oxaliplatin treatment (0.5 Amol/L) for 48 h induces the protein expression of two subunits of the g-secretase protein complex, nicastrin and
presenilin-1. Equal protein loading was confirmed by probing for tubulin expression. C, siRNA (60 pmol/L) to the nicastrin subunit of the g-secretase complex
suppresses nicastrin protein expression at 48 h (top left), which decreases the activity of a Hes-1 luciferase reporter in HCT116 cells (bottom left) and decreases activity
of the g-secretase complex (right ). All values were normalized for transfection efficiency. Columns, percentage of the untreated controls; bars, SE. D, HCT116
cells were transfected with siRNA to nicastrin (60 pmol/L) for 24 h and then treated with oxaliplatin (0.5 or 1 Amol/L) for an additional 24 h. siRNA to nicastrin prevents the
induction of g-secretase activity by oxaliplatin (left ) and abrogates the induction of nicastrin protein by oxaliplatin (right ). Nicastrin siRNA also suppresses the increase in
NICD and cyclin D1 protein expression by oxaliplatin (right ). Total Notch-1 protein is also mildly decreased (right ). Equal protein loading was shown by probing for
tubulin.

increased g-secretase activity in a dose-dependent manner
compared with media-treated cells. This induction of g-secretase
could be abrogated by cotreatment with GSI34, a g-secretase
inhibitor, at each dose of oxaliplatin (Fig. 3A, black columns). We
then examined if this induction in activity of the g-secretase
enzyme complex was caused by an increase in the expression of
its components. Treatment of HCT116 cells with oxaliplatin
induced the expression of two subunits of g-secretase, PS1 and
NCT (Fig. 3B). Because of the role that NCT may play in assembling
the complex, we studied the effects of inhibiting NCT induction by
using siRNA to target NCT. Transfection of HCT116 cells with NCT
siRNA inhibited the protein levels of NCT (Fig. 3C, top left), which
decreased the activity of the enzyme as measured with the in vitro
assay (Fig. 3C, bottom left). This inhibition of g-secretase activity
effectively decreased Notch signaling, as measured by Hes-1 activity
(Fig. 3C, right). In HCT116 cells, suppression of nicastrin protein
with siRNA prevented both the induction of g-secretase enzyme
activity (Fig. 3D, left) and the induction of NICD and cyclin D1

protein previously observed after oxaliplatin (Fig. 3D, right). Fulllength Notch-1 protein is also mildly decreased (Fig. 3D, left).
GSIs abrogate Notch-1 induction by chemotherapy to
enhance colon cancer chemosensitivity. We then hypothesized
that the increase in Notch-1 by oxaliplatin could be blocked if the
cell lines were cotreated with a GSI. Our group used a novel
sulfonamide analogue GSI34, synthesized as described (24). First,
treatment of HCT116 cells with GSI34 effectively blocked the
production of NICD protein at baseline (Fig. 4A, top). In the
presence of either GSI34 or 0.1% DMSO as a control, HCT116 cells
were then treated with increasing doses of oxaliplatin. Again,
oxaliplatin, in the absence of GSI (marked ‘‘ ’’), increases the
levels of NICD protein (Fig. 4A, top, first row) but decreases the
expression of full-length Notch-1 (second row). At each dose level,
the addition of GSI34 (marked ‘‘+’’) abrogated the induction of
NICD protein by oxaliplatin and results in the accumulation of fulllength Notch-1 (Fig. 4A, top). It was then examined if GSI34 could
inhibit the activation of the Notch-1 pathway by measuring Hes-1

Figure 4. GSIs lessen Notch-1 induction by oxaliplatin. A, HCT116 cells were cotreated with oxaliplatin and GSI34 at 10 Amol/L (+) or DMSO for 48 h ( ). Whereas
oxaliplatin induced NICD expression, cotreatment with GSI34 lessened this induction (top ). In contrast, the expression of full-length Notch-1 was not affected by
oxaliplatin, whereas cotreatment with GSI34 increased levels (bottom). Finally, GSI34 (bottom, black columns ) lessened the induction of Hes-1 activity by oxaliplatin
(gray columns). B, a panel of colon cancer cells was treated with oxaliplatin (1 Amol/L) combined with either GSI34 (10 Amol/L) or 0.1% DMSO for 48 h to assess
Hes-1 activity. GSI34 (black columns ) abrogated the induction of Hes-1 by oxaliplatin in each colon cancer cell line. C, HCT116 were treated with 0.1% DMSO,
oxaliplatin (1 Amol/L), GSI34 (10 Amol/L), or the combination of both drugs for 48 h, and colonies were counted after 14 d. Although GSI34 or oxaliplatin decreased
colony formation, the combination of both drugs most significantly suppressed viability (Student’s t test, P = 0.034). The combination of GSI34 with 5-FU (8 Amol/L) or
SN-38 (20 nmol/L) also suppressed colonies more than either treatment alone. Columns, percentage of colonies in the DMSO group; bars, SE. D, to create an
isobologram, HCT116 cells were treated with increasing ratios of oxaliplatin (up to 0.6 Amol/L) and GSI34 (up to 25 Amol/L) for 48 h. The percentage of colonies
determined the IC50 values for each ratio, which were plotted (black line ) and compared with the additive effect (gray line ), to suggest a synergistic interaction. To
measure apoptosis, HCT116 cells were cotreated with oxaliplatin (0.5 Amol/L) and either GSI34 at 10 Amol/L (black columns ) or 0.1% DMSO (gray columns ) for 48
h and stained with DAPI. The number of apoptotic cells was increased by the combination treatment (P < 0.05). Columns, percentage of cells with nuclear

enhanced the chemosensitivity of HCT116 to SN-38 and 5-FU
(P < 0.05; Fig. 4C). Using isobologram experiments, we confirmed
that the combination of GSI34 and oxaliplatin synergistically
decreased the IC50 in HCT116 cells (Fig. 4D, top). It was then
examined if colon cancer cells cotreated with oxaliplatin and GSI34
were undergoing enhanced apoptosis. Cotreatment of HCT116 cells
with GSI34 and oxaliplatin significantly increased the percentage of
apoptotic cells compared with either treatment alone, as
determined by DAPI staining for nuclear fragmentation (P < 0.05,
Fig. 4D, bottom).
Notch-1 expression affects chemosensitivity. Because the
g-secretase complex cleaves multiple transmembrane receptors
besides Notch-1, including the other Notch receptors (Notch-2 to
Notch-4), we wanted to confirm that the enhancement of
chemosensitivity by GSI34 was mediated by Notch-1. First, we
used multiple siRNA constructs to specifically inhibit Notch-1 to
determine if the chemosensitivity observed with GSI34 could be
replicated. Transfection of HCT116 cells with siRNA to Notch-1 for
24 hours decreased the expression of full-length Notch-1 protein,
which down-regulated expression of NICD and a downstream

activity. Cotreatment with GSI34 abrogated the induction of Hes-1
by oxaliplatin at 0.5 Amol/L but did not completely suppress the
induction at the higher dose of 1 Amol/L (Fig. 4A, bottom). GSI34
also decreased Notch-1 induction by oxaliplatin in four other colon
cancer cells: HT29, LS513, SW480, and SW620 (Fig. 4B). Finally,
cotreatment of HCT116 cells with GSI34 suppressed the induction
of Hes-1 by other chemotherapies, including 5-FU alone (Supplementary Fig. S2A) or 5-FU combined with oxaliplatin (Supplementary Fig. S2B).
Because it was hypothesized that activation of Notch-1 may
protect colon cancer cells from chemotherapy, we examined if
inhibition of Notch-1 could decrease chemoresistance. Cell lines
were treated with oxaliplatin combined with GSI34 or DMSO for
48 hours, and viability was then measured in a colony-forming
assay. In HCT116 cells, treatment with oxaliplatin or GSI34 as
single agents decreased colony formation by 40%, but the
combination of GSI34 and oxaliplatin decreased colony formation
by 60% (Student’s t test, P = 0.034; Fig. 4C). Similar reductions in
colony formation by GSI34 and oxaliplatin were observed in SW620
and LS513 cells (Supplementary Fig. 2C). GSI cotreatment also

left). NICD transfection increased expression of the Notch-1 target
cyclin D1 (Fig. 5C, top left) and activated Hes-1 (Fig. 5C, bottom left).
After transfection with NICD or vector alone for 12 hours, HCT116
cells were then treated with oxaliplatin for 48 hours. Overexpression of NICD did not significantly change the percentage of
colonies compared with cells transfected with vector alone (Fig. 5C,
right). Although treatment with oxaliplatin decreased the percentage of colonies by 50%, overexpression of NICD protected against
oxaliplatin, as no decrease in colony formation occurred (Fig. 5C,
right). We then examined if Notch-1 expression could affect the
chemosensitivity of HCT116 cells to SN-38. HCT116 cells were first
transfected with either Notch-1 siRNA or with NICD, and the
percentage of viable cells after treatment with SN-38 was then
measured using the SRB viability assay. Again, Notch-1 siRNA
enhanced chemosensitivity to SN-38, whereas overexpression of
NICD increased resistance to SN-38 (Fig. 5D).
GSIs decrease the induction of prosurvival factors, including Akt signaling, by oxaliplatin. We then investigated the
mechanisms underlying how inhibition of Notch-1 signaling may
enhance chemosensitivity. First, we examined if GSI cotreatment

Notch-1 target cyclin D1 (Fig. 5A, top left). siRNA to Notch-1 also
decreased the baseline transcriptional activity of Hes-1 (P = 0.014;
Fig. 5A, bottom left) compared with cells transfected with control
siRNA. Notch-1 siRNA also decreased the clonogenicity of HCT116
cells at 48 hours (Fig. 5A, right). It was then determined if Notch-1
siRNA could enhance chemosensitivity to oxaliplatin. Like the
results with GSI34, the combination of Notch-1 siRNA and
oxaliplatin significantly decreased viability compared with either
Notch-1 siRNA alone or chemotherapy alone (P = 0.011; Fig. 5A,
right). We then examined if the Notch ligand JAG-1 is required for
chemosensitivity. HCT116 cells transfected with siRNA targeting
JAG-1 show no enhanced sensitivity to oxaliplatin compared with
cells transfected with control siRNA (Fig. 5B). Inhibition of the
g-secretase complex with siRNA targeting nicastrin, however, did
increase the sensitivity of HCT116 cells to oxaliplatin (Fig. 5B).
Because inhibition of Notch-1 could enhance chemosensitivity,
we then examined if overexpression of NICD could instead increase
colon cancer chemoresistance. HCT116 cells were transfected with
an NICD construct for 24 hours, which significantly increased NICD
protein but did not affect full-length Notch-1 protein (Fig. 5C, top

Figure 5. Notch-1 expression affects chemosensitivity. A, HCT116 cells were transfected with siRNA (60 pmol/L) to Notch-1 or to control sequences for 48 h.
Notch-1 siRNA decreased Notch-1 expression, resulting in decreased NICD and cyclin D1 protein (top left). NICD transfection also decreased the activity of a Hes-1
luciferase reporter (bottom left). HCT116 cells were then transfected with siRNA to Notch-1 or control for 12 h before treatment with oxaliplatin (0.5 Amol/L) or media for
another 48 h (right ). The combination of Notch-1 siRNA and oxaliplatin decreased colony formation more than either treatment alone (P = 0.011). B, HCT116 cells were
transfected with siRNA (60 pmol/L) to JAG-1, nicastrin, or control sequences for 12 h and then treated with oxaliplatin (0.5 Amol/L) for an additional 48 h. Whereas
JAG-1 siRNA did not affect the chemosensitivity of HCT116 cells to oxaliplatin, nicastrin siRNA further sensitized the cells compared with control siRNA (P < 0.05).
C, HCT116 cells were transfected with pCS2-NICD (1 Ag) for 24 h, and NICD expression increased but not full-length Notch-1 protein (top left). NICD transfection also
increased cyclin D1 (top ) and enhanced Hes-1 luciferase activity after 48 h (bottom ). HCT116 cells were then transfected with pCS2-NICD (2 Ag) for 12 h and
were treated with oxaliplatin (0.5 Amol/L) for 48 h. Expression of NICD protected the cells from oxaliplatin (P < 0.05). D, HCT116 cells were transfected with Notch-1 or
control siRNA (60 pmol/L) and were treated with SN-38 (0.2 nmol/L) for 48 h. The combination of Notch-1 siRNA and SN-38 decreased viability significantly compared
with either treatment alone (P = 0.022). In contrast, overexpression of NICD in HCT116 cells increased chemoresistance to SN-38.

Figure 6. GSIs decrease the induction of prosurvival factors, including Akt signaling, by oxaliplatin. A, HCT116 cells were treated with both oxaliplatin and GSI34
(10 Amol/L) or DMSO for 48 h before total protein lysates were probed with antibodies, as indicated. GSI34 decreased the expression of Bcl-XL and survivin after
oxaliplatin and blunted the increase in cyclin D1 (top ). GSI34 also decreased phosphorylated AktSer473, mTOR, and phosphorylated S6Ser235/Ser236 proteins after
oxaliplatin (bottom ). Total S6 and DNA-PK proteins were also decreased by cotreatment with GSI34 but not by oxaliplatin. B, HCT116 cells were transfected with siRNA
to Akt (50 nmol/L) for 48 h, decreasing total Akt protein (top ). The percentage of colonies formed was also decreased by siRNA to Akt after oxaliplatin (bottom )
compared with cells transfected with control siRNA (P < 0.05). C, after treatment with chemotherapy (oxaliplatin, 5-FU, or SN-38), colon cancer cells activate the
Notch pathway by up-regulating the g-secretase protein complex through induction of NCT and PS1 subunits to cleave more NICD (top ). NICD proteins then activate
targets involved in chemoresistance, such as PI3K/Akt, Bcl-XL, survivin, and cyclin D1. In contrast, down-regulation of Notch signaling chemosensitizes cells, as
prosurvival targets are no longer activated (bottom ). The Notch pathway can be suppressed if the colon cancer cells are cotreated with GSIs, which prevent the
formation of the cleaved NICD by blocking the g-secretase protein complex. Therefore, the colon cancer cell is more chemosensitive after inhibition of Notch signaling.

results suggest that inhibition of Notch-1 signaling may sensitize
colon cancer cells to oxaliplatin by preventing the activation of
prosurvival pathways, including Akt, after DNA damage.

could decrease several prosurvival factors implicated in chemoresistance to oxaliplatin. Treatment of HCT116 cells with GSI34
decreased the baseline levels of Bcl-XL and survivin and suppressed
the induction of cyclin D1 by oxaliplatin (Fig. 6A, top). Second,
because Notch-1 may activate PI3K/Akt signaling to protect against
DNA damage (7), the expression of proteins in this pathway was
examined. In HCT116 cells, cotreatment with GSI34 decreased the
phosphorylation of Akt at Ser473 by oxaliplatin and also mildly
decreased total Akt levels (Fig. 6A, bottom). We then examined two
targets of Akt, mTOR, and S6 ribosomal protein. Levels of total
mTOR, phosphorylated S6 at Ser235/236, and total S6 protein levels
were decreased after cotreatment with GSI34 and oxaliplatin
(Fig. 6A, bottom). We then examined the expression of a kinase that
may activate Akt, DNA-PK, as cotreatment with GSI34 and
oxaliplatin decreased the protein levels of DNA-PK (Fig. 6A,
bottom). Because intact Akt signaling may play a role in chemoresistance, we determined if suppression of Akt with siRNA would
affect chemosensitivity to oxaliplatin. siRNA to Akt effectively
suppressed total Akt protein levels (Fig. 6B, top) and decreased the

Discussion
In this study, we report that colon cancer cell lines can be
rendered more sensitive to chemotherapy by down-regulation of
Notch-1 signaling. We first provide evidence that the Notch-1
pathway is overexpressed during colon cancer progression, similar
to other genes involved in chemoresistance. Overexpression of
Notch-1 has previously been reported in other solid tumors, but
this marks the first report in colon cancers. The entire Notch
pathway seems activated, as downstream targets, such as Hes-1,
are also elevated and overexpression of Hes-1 has been previously
reported in primary colon tumors (26). In addition, Numb, a
negative regulator of Notch, is suppressed during colon cancer
development, a finding that has been reported in breast cancers (9).

Oxaliplatin Induces Notch-1 Signaling in Colon Cancers

in colon cancer cells, the selective suppression of Notch-1 with
siRNA enhances the effects of both oxaliplatin and SN-38. Similarly,
overexpression of NICD protected against these two agents. This is
consistent with a previous report that NICD overexpression
protects against cisplatin in lung and liver cancer lines (4).
Interestingly, the degree of sensitization to oxaliplatin by siRNA to
Notch-1 was not as great as with GSI34. As GS134 targets all four
Notch receptors, current experiments are now on-going using
siRNA to knockdown expression of each Notch receptor to
determine its effects on chemosensitivity.
The possible mechanisms by which GSIs enhance the effect of
chemotherapy in colon cancer cells seem multifactorial. First,
GSI34 suppressed the expression of three prosurvival factors that
are targets of Notch-1 and have been reported to play a role in
chemosensitivity to oxaliplatin: cyclin D1 (39), Bcl-XL (40), and
survivin (41). Second, we show that GSI34 can also affect the
activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway by oxaliplatin, as Notch-1
signaling has been implicated in AKT activation. For example,
Notch-1 can activate Akt in T-cells (6), as well as in melanoma (42),
leukemia (43), and cervical cancers (44). In addition, a recent
microarray study identified overexpression of Akt and Notch
signaling as hallmarks of gliomas with an eventual poor prognosis
(45). NICD overexpression results in the phosphorylation of Akt at
Ser473 (4, 5, 42), and GSIs decrease phosphorylated Akt at this site
in cervical cancer cells (44). In this study, we show that GSI34
abrogates the oxaliplatin-induced phosphorylation of Akt at Ser473.
Likewise, two downstream targets of Akt, S6 and mTOR, are also
decreased by Notch inhibition. Other studies have also reported a
link between Akt/mTor pathways and Notch-1. For example, in
lymphoid cell lines, cotransfection with a dominant-negative Akt
mutant decreased the protection mediated by Notch-1 against
apoptosis (7), and the protective effect of NICD against p53mediated apoptosis could be abrogated if mTOR was inhibited (4).
In leukemia cells, inactivation of PTEN, which negatively regulates
Akt activity, can cause resistance to GSIs (46). Interestingly, all of
the colon cancer cell lines used in this study seem to have wild-type
PTEN status, which would agree with the hypothesis from that
study. Finally, there may be alternative mechanisms of chemosensitization by GSIs. For example, in Kaposi’s sarcoma cell lines, it
has been reported that treatment with GSIs induces mitotic
catastrophe (47).
Therefore, we propose a model for how Notch signaling may
mediate chemoresistance. First, it is hypothesized that colon
cancer cells activate Notch-1 in response to chemotherapy as a
protective pathway (Fig. 6C, top). Upon sensing DNA damage, the
cancer cell augments the activity of the g-secretase complex
by increasing the expression of its subunits, including PS-1 and
NCT. The increased protein subunits are then formed into
multiple g-secretase complexes, which cleave more Notch-1
receptors to produce NICD. After translocating into the nucleus,
the increased NICD can activate the PI3K/Akt pathway or other
prosurvival targets, such as Bcl-XL, cyclin D1, and survivin.
Consequently, suppression of Notch-1 signaling by blocking NICD
production with GSIs down-regulates transcriptional targets
involved in cellular survival, shifting the cell toward chemosensitivity (Fig. 6C, bottom). Therefore, our results suggest that, in
colon cancer, Notch signaling may be an important modulator of
cell survival, and Notch inhibition may provide a novel strategy to
enhance the effects of chemotherapy in the treatment of patients
with metastatic colon cancer. This model may be testable as
Notch inhibitors enter clinical trials (48).

Whether other regulators of Notch signaling are also affected by
chemotherapy is currently being studied.
The effect of chemotherapy on the Notch-1 signaling pathway
has not been previously studied. Our results indicate that
chemotherapy, in fact, activates the Notch pathway in colon
cancer cells by inducing NICD. The induction of NICD by DNA
damage has been previously shown in neuroblastoma cells after
treatment with the histone deacetylase inhibitor valproic acid (27).
Our data indicate that the induction of NICD in our colon cancer
cell lines is not mediated by the p53 gene. This is in contrast to
keratinocytes, in which it has been reported that Notch-1 is a p53
target (28). The differences may be related to tissue specificity, as
Notch-1 seems to function as a tumor suppressor in epithelial
tissues (reviewed in ref. 1). Interestingly, Numb has been reported
to regulate p53, preventing its degradation (29). There does seem
to be a link between p53 and Notch-1 in some tumor types, as
restoration of p53 in human prostate and breast cancer cells
increased Notch-1 (30).
It has been reported that Akt activation can induce NICD
production through induction of g-secretase (31) and that DNA
damage from chemotherapy can increase the activity of g-secretase
protein (32). Our results indicate that the induction of NICD by
chemotherapy may be due to an augmentation of g-secretase
activity from an increase in the expression of select components
(PS-1 and NCT) of the g-secretase complex. This is consistent with
previous studies showing that overexpression of PEN-2 can
increase g-secretase activity (33). The observation that NCT is
induced by chemotherapy is not entirely unexpected. NCT is an
essential component of the g-secretase complex, as it has been
reported in mouse knockout models that g-secretase activity
is dependent on NCT (34). As oxaliplatin increases NCT in the
g-secretase complex, targeting of NCT with siRNA prevented the
induction of NICD by oxaliplatin in the colon cancer cells.
Interestingly, in endothelial cells, treatment with a GSI has been
shown to suppress NICD production by vascular endothelial
growth factor (31).
If activation of Notch-1 signaling contributes to chemoresistance, then inhibition of the Notch pathway could sensitize cells to
chemotherapy. Our results indicate that the viability of colon
cancer cells was synergistically decreased by GSI34 in combination with multiple forms of chemotherapy, including oxaliplatin,
SN-38, and 5-FU. This effect was associated with inhibition
of NICD production and suppression of Hes-1 activity. Use of
GSIs may then present a novel means to both enhance the
effects of chemotherapy and to delay chemoresistance in patients
with metastatic disease, as oxaliplatin resistance has been
correlated with colon cancer progression from an epithelial to
an invasive phenotype (35). This effect of GSI may be tumorspecific. For example, in neuroendocrine cells, Notch-1 may act as
a tumor suppressor (36). Therefore, it remains to be determined
whether this effect of GSI on chemotherapy can be extended to
all tumor subtypes.
Because GSIs, as a class, also prevent the cleavage of other
transmembrane proteins and because the IC50 of GSI34 in colon
cancer cells was in the low micromolar range, we performed
several siRNA experiments to clarify that the chemosensitivity
induced by GSI34 was indeed mediated by inhibition of the Notch-1
receptor and not by an off-target effect. In HCT116 cells,
transfection with siRNA to Notch-1 increases apoptosis by UV
irradiation (37). In fact, in lung cancer cells, the induction of
Notch-1 sensitizes the cells to GSIs (38). Our studies indicate that,
