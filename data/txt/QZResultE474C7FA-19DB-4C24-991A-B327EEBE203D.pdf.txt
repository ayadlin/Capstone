Abstract
The EphA2 receptor tyrosine kinase is selectively expressed on
the surface of many different human tumors. We have
previously shown that tumor cells can be targeted by EphA2
monoclonal antibodies and that these antibodies function, in
part, by inducing EphA2 internalization and degradation. In
this report, we describe the isolation and characterization of a
fully human monoclonal antibody (1C1) that selectively binds
both the human and rodent EphA2 receptor. After cell
binding, the antibody induces rapid tyrosine phosphorylation,
internalization, and degradation of the EphA2 receptor.
Because monoclonal antibodies that selectively bind tumor
cells and internalize provide a vehicle for targeted delivery of
cytotoxics, 1C1 was conjugated to the microtubule inhibitor
monomethylauristatin phenylalanine using a stable maleimidocaproyl linker. The anti-EphA2 antibody-drug conjugate
[1C1–maleimidocaproyl-MMAF (mcMMAF)] stimulated the
activation of caspase-3/caspase-7 and the death of EphA2expressing cells with IC50 values as low as 3 ng/mL. Similarly,
the conjugate induced degradation of the EphA2 receptor and
inhibited tumor growth in vivo. Administration of 1C1mcMMAF at doses as low as 1 mg/kg once weekly resulted in
significant growth inhibition of EphA2-expressing tumors
without any observable adverse effects in mouse xenograft
and rat syngeneic tumor models. Our data support the use of
an antibody-drug conjugate approach to selectively target and
inhibit the growth of EphA2-expressing tumors. [Cancer Res

Introduction
One of the largest subfamilies of tyrosine kinase receptors is the
erythropoietin producing hepatoma (Eph) receptor family. This
family consists of two classes of receptors, the A and B classes,
which are grouped in accordance to their similarities in sequence
homology and ligand specificities (1, 2). The biological significance
of Ephs and their ligands, Ephrins, under normal physiologic
conditions has been linked to the modulation of axonal guidance,
spine morphogenesis, and angiogenesis during rodent embryonic
development (2–6). Like many other tyrosine kinase receptors, Ephs
have also been implicated in the development and progression of
several types of cancer (7). In particular, EphA2 protein overexpression has been observed in tumors of the breast, prostate,
lung, colon (reviewed in ref. 8), and glioblastoma multiforme (9).

Furthermore, in ovarian, esophageal, and renal cells, increased
expression of EphA2 of cancer patients has been linked to decreased
survival rates suggesting that EphA2 receptor expression may have
functional significance in these tumor types (10–12).
A direct functional role for EphA2 in tumor development has also
been implicated. Overexpression of EphA2 in mammary epithelial
cells is sufficient to cause tumorigenesis (13). It is thought that
overexpression of the receptor leads to mislocalization and a loss of
contact with the Ephrin ligands, leading to an increase in cellmatrix adhesions and a higher invasive potential (14). Consequently,
stimulation of the unbound EphA2 receptor with soluble Ephrin
ligand inactivates Ras and reduces phosphorylation of focal
adhesion kinase (FAK) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase in
some model systems (15, 16). Specific stimulation of EphA2 using
agonistic antibodies or soluble EphA2 receptors have also resulted
in delayed tumor progression in mouse xenografts (17–20). Recently,
an EphrinA1-Pseudomonas aeruginosa exotoxin A conjugate has
been used to target and inhibit the growth of EphA2-expressing
glioblastoma multiforme (21). However, other studies have suggested that stimulation of EphA2 results in activation of FAK and
has no effect on in vivo tumor growth, suggesting that the response
to EphA2 stimulation may be context-dependent (22, 23). These
discrepancies make the functional significance of EphA2 in tumor
progression unclear, such that the development path for traditional
therapeutic antibody approaches may be challenging.
Antibodies armed with cytotoxics provide a mechanism to
circumvent the uncertainty around EphA2 biology. Derivatives of
the tubulin polymerization inhibitor, auristatins, have successfully
been used as potent cytotoxic agents delivered by conjugated
antibodies (24). Two modified auristatins, monomethyl auristatin E
(MMAE), which is cell permeable, and monomethyl auristatin
phenylalanine (MMAF), which is cell impermeable, have been
conjugated to antibodies through either the protease-sensitive
maleimidocaproyl-valine-citrulline or the protease-resistant
maleimidocaproyl linker. Various linker and auristatin combinations can specifically kill tumor cells after internalization through
cell surface antigens, such as CD30, CD70, and CD79 (25–27). The
covalent linkage is stable until the antibody-drug conjugate enters
the lysosomal vesicles, upon which the drug is released in the
cytoplasm and disrupts microtubule polymerization.
The broad tumor expression coupled with limited normal
expression makes EphA2 an attractive target for antibody-drug
conjugate therapy. Herein, we describe the first in vitro and in vivo
evidence for specific and potent antitumor activity of an antibodydrug conjugate targeting the EphA2 receptor.

overnight at 4jC and blocked with 2% milk in PBS (pH 7.4). The phage
library (Fab310, Dyax; ref. 28) was blocked with 2% milk, deselected with
control human IgG to remove Fc binding phage, and then transferred to the
EphA2-coated immunotubes. After a 2-h incubation, the immunotubes were
washed with PBST (PBS + 0.1% Tween 20) for 10 to 20 times and then
further washed with PBS for 10 to 20 times to remove the unbound phage.
The bound phage were eluted with 1 mL of 100 mmol/L triethylamine
(Sigma), neutralized with 0.5 mL of 1 mol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.5; Invitrogen),
and used to infect log-phase TG1 (Novagen). After a 30-min incubation at
37jC in a water bath, the phage-infected TG1 cells were plated on 2YT agar
plates (Teknova) with carbenicillin (Invitrogen) and 2% glucose, and the
plates were incubated overnight at 30jC. The resulting colonies were
collected and infected with helper phage M13K07 (Invitrogen). The infected
cells were cultured overnight in 2YT with carbenicillin and kanamycin
(Sigma) at 30jC to generate high titer phage. The phage from the overnight
culture was precipitated and used for a subsequent round of panning.
ELISA plates (Costar) were coated with 10 Ag/mL of EphA2-Fc. After
washing and blocking with 5% milk for 1 h at room temperature, the phage
were added to each well of the blocked plates. The plates were washed and
incubated with anti–M13-horseradish peroxidase (HRP) antibody (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h before detection with SureBlue TMB peroxidase
substrate (KPL). The reaction was stopped with 50 AL of 0.2 mol/L H2SO4,
and the ELISA signal was read at 450 nm.
EphA2-binding phage clones were sequenced, and unique clones were
converted to full-length human IgG1, as described previously (29). The
antibodies were transiently expressed in HEK293 cells using the transfection
reagent 293 fectin (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Transfected cells were incubated for 9 d to allow for antibody production.
Conditioned medium was collected on days 3, 6, and 9 of the incubation
period. The secreted antibody in culture supernatant was purified using a
precast protein A column (GE Healthcare). The bound antibody was eluted
from the column with acidic buffer (pH 3.0), neutralized, and dialyzed
against PBS. The concentration of the purified antibody is calculated at
280-nm absorbance of the solution.
Eph receptor cross-reactivity ELISA. ELISA plates (Costar) were
coated with 50 AL of diluted antibodies and incubated at 4jC overnight. On
the next day, the plates were washed five times with 1 PBST (1 PSB, 0.1%
Tween 20) and blocked with 240 AL of blocking buffer [2% bovine serum
albumin (BSA) w/v in 1 PBST] for 1 h at room temperature. Recombinant
Eph receptors (R&D Systems) were biotinylated with EZ-link sulfo-NHSbiotin reagent (Pierce) at a challenge ratio of eight biotins per Eph receptor
molecule. The biotinylated Eph receptors were quenched with 50 mmol/L
Tris-HCl (Invitrogen), and a dilution to 1 Ag/mL was made in blocking
buffer. Fifty microliters of the diluted biotinylated EphA2 receptor were
added to each well and incubated at 37jC for 1 h. The plates were washed,
and 50 AL neutravidin-HRP (1:12,500; Pierce) were added for 1 h at 37jC.
Thoroughly washed and dried plates were incubated with 50 AL of SureBlue
TMB peroxidase substrate (KPL) for 5 min at room temperature. The
reaction was stopped with 50 AL of 0.2 mol/L H2SO4, and the ELISA signal
was read at 450 nm.
Determination of EphA2 levels. Treatment of cells, sample extraction,
immunoprecipitation, and Western blotting to detect degradation was
performed, as previously described (30). Excised tumor pieces were
homogenized in Lysing Matrix A tubes (MP Biomedicals) containing
radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer (Boston Bioproducts) with a
Fastprep-24 instrument. Precleared lysates were measured using a
bicinchoninic acid kit (Pierce). Membranes were probed with 1 Ag/mL of
either anti-EphA2 (clone 1C11A12; Zymed) or anti–glyceraldehyde-3phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) monoclonal antibody (Applied Biosystems), as indicated in the figures.
The amount of EphA2 was quantitated by ELISA. Mouse anti-EphA2
(clone 1C11A12; Zymed) was added at 1 Ag/mL in DPBS (Invitrogen) to 96well, solid white MaxiSorp plates (Nunc) and incubated overnight at 4jC.
On the next day, plates were blocked in DPBS + 3% BSA for 1 h at room
temperature and washed once in DPBS. Recombinant EphA2 receptor
(Invitrogen) serially diluted in RIPA buffer served as the standard. Tumor

lysates were diluted to 1.5 mg/mL in RIPA buffer. One hundred microliters
of the tumor lysates (150 Ag) were used for the EphA2 ELISA. Lysates
were incubated at room temperature for 1 h and washed four times in
PBST (PBS + 0.1% Tween 20). Rabbit anti-EphA2 (Invitrogen) diluted to
1.5 Ag/mL in assay buffer (DPBS + 0.3% BSA) was added to each well and
incubated at room temperature for 1 h and washed four times in PBST.
Mouse anti-rabbit IgG (H + L)–HRP conjugate (Jackson ImmunoResearch)
diluted at 1:5,000 in assay buffer was added to each well and incubated at
room temperature for 1 h. Subsequently, plates were washed four times in
PBST, and the binding of EphA2 was detected using BM Chemiluminescence ELISA Substrate (POD, Roche). Plates were incubated for 4 min
in the dark and read using a Wallac Victor 1420 Multilabel Counter
(Perkin-Elmer).
Antibody internalization. Adherent PC3 cells in log growth phase were
removed from tissue culture flask using Life Technologies Cell Dissociation
Buffer (Invitrogen). Viable cells (0.5  106) were aliquoted into wells of a
U-bottomed 96-well plate in 100 AL of growth media. The cells were
centrifuged at 1,500 rpm for 5 min and labeled with primary antibody-drug
conjugates by resuspension in 100 AL PBS containing 5 Ag of 1C1–
maleimidocaproyl-MMAF (mcMMAF) or mcMMAF-conjugated isotype
control IgG and incubated for 30 min at 4jC. Cells were then washed
twice with PBS and cell surface–bound primary antibody-drug conjugates
were allowed to internalize by resuspending the cells in 100 AL of growth
media [RPMI 1640 + 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS)] and incubation at 37jC/
5% CO2 for 30 min or on ice as negative control (labeled 30 and 0 min,
respectively). Subsequent to internalization, cells were fixed (4% paraformaldehyde, Kodak, for 20 min at room temperature) and permeabilized
(0.5% Triton X-100, Sigma Aldrich, for 5 min at room temperature). Cells
were then labeled with secondary AlexaFluor 488 goat anti-human IgG
antibody (Biosource) by resuspension in 100 AL PBS + 2% FBS containing
1 Ag of secondary antibody and incubated for 30 min at 4jC. Cells were
washed twice with cold PBS between the above steps.
The cells were then resuspended in 200 AL PBS and spun down onto
coated slides using Shandon EZ Single Cytofunnels and a Shandon Cytospin 3
(700 RPM, 7 min). Finally, the cells were covered with VECTASHIELD hardset
mounting media with 4¶,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Vector Labs) and a
coverslip before examination and photography with fluorescent microscope.
Antibody conjugation. General methods for conjugation have been
described previously (27). The monoclonal antibody 1C1 was resuspended
in 50 mmol/L sodium borate, 50 mmol/L NaCl, and 1 mmol/L
diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (pH 8.0) and was partially reduced with
3.25 equivalents of Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride at 37jC for
2.5 h to yield about six thiols per antibody. The mixture was cooled to 0jC
and alkylated with 1.1 equivalents of mcMMAF per thiol for 30 min. Excess
mcMMAF was quenched with 1 mmol/L cysteine, and the entire mixture
was purified on a size-exclusion chromatography column (PD10, GE
Healthcare) equilibrated with PBS. This process resulted in <0.5%
unconjugated mcMMAF and <2% protein aggregates. The molar ratio of
drug substitution was measured at about four drugs per antibody, according
to previously published methods (27).
Europium-labeled antibody binding assays. Europium-labeled antibodies were produced according to manufacturer’s instructions (PerkinElmer). PC3 cells grown to exponential phase were detached with cell
dissociation solution (Invitrogen) and suspended in ice-cold binding buffer
(1  DELFIA L*R binding buffer containing 50% stabilizer, PerkinElmer).
The europium-labeled antibodies, Eu-1C1 or Eu-1C1-mcMMAF, were
diluted with binding buffer and incubated with 1  105 cells in duplicate
for 1 h at 4jC. Binding was terminated by four washes with ice-cold DELFIA
L*R wash buffer and incubated with 200 AL of enhancement solution
(PerkinElmer) for 15 min at room temperature. Fluorescence was measured
on a Wallac Victor 1420 Multilabel Counter (Perkin-Elmer). Saturation
binding curves were analyzed with GraphPad Prism software. Dissociation
constants were calculated by Scatchard analysis. Nonspecific binding was
tested in the presence of 2 Amol/L of unlabeled 1C1 or 1C1-mcMMAF.
Analysis of EphA2 expression using flow cytometry. Cell lines were
grown in a monolayer culture in complete growth medium, harvested using
cell dissociation buffer (Invitrogen), and washed with 1  DPBS. After

centrifugation, the cells were resuspended in 1  DPBS + 1.0% BSA
[fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) buffer], counted, and aliquoted
to 4  10 5 cells per well in a 96-well plate format. Cells were incubated with
1 Ag of an isotype control or 1C1-mcMMAF for 30 min at 4jC to 8jC. After
washing with FACS buffer, the cells were incubated with 1 Ag of goat antihuman IgG labeled with ALEXAFluor 488 (Invitrogen) for 30 min at 4jC to
8jC. The cells were washed and resuspended in FACS buffer, and 10 AL of a
50 Ag/mL propidium iodide solution was added to the appropriate wells for
live and dead cell exclusion. The samples were analyzed via FACS on an
LSRII (Becton Dickinson Biosciences). FlowJo software (Treestar) was used
to analyze the data obtained from flow cytometry analysis.
Determination of in vitro cell viability and caspase-3/caspase-7
activity. All tumor cell lines were obtained from American Type
Culture Collection and cultured in recommended conditions. Human
umbilical vascular endothelial cells (HUVEC) and growth media
were obtained from Lonza and used between passages 3 and 6. All
cells were grown in 96-well culture plates in their recommended growth
media overnight at a concentration of 3  103 cells per well. On the
following day, treatments were added in fresh media to duplicate wells.
Cellular viability was determined 72 h later using the CellTiter-Glo
Luminescent Cell Viability Assay kit (Promega), as directed in the
manufacturer’s protocol. Cell viability was calculated as a percentage of
control untreated cells. For assessment of caspase-3/caspase-7 activity, PC3
cells were plated into white-walled 96-well culture plates and treated as
described above. The cells were incubated for 72 h before caspase-3/
caspase-7 activity was measured with Caspase-Glo Assay kit (Promega), and
cell number was measured from two duplicate wells with CellTiter-Glo
Luminescent Cell Viability Assay kit, as described in the manufacturer’s
protocols. The caspase-3/caspase-7 activity was then normalized to the cell
number for each sample.
EphA2 short interfering RNA transfection protocol. Two million PC3
cells were plated on 100-mm dishes and transfected using DharmaFECT 2
(Dharmacon, Inc.), as described by the manufacturer. Each plate was
transfected with 1.2 nmol of the following short interfering RNA (siRNA)
pools (Dharmacon, Inc.): EphA2 specific sequences (5¶-TGAATGACATGCCGATCTA-3¶, 5¶-GAAGTTCACTACCGAGATC-3¶, 5¶-CAAGTTCGCTGACATCGTC-3¶, 5¶-TCACACACCCGTATGGCAA-3¶), mismatched negative
control sequences (5¶-TGGTTTACATGTCGACTAA-3¶, 5¶-TGGTTTACATGTTTTCTGA-3¶, 5¶-TGGTTTACATGTTTTCCTA-3¶, 5¶-TGGTTTAC A T G T T G T G T G A - 3 ¶) , a n d G A P D H s p e c i f i c s e q u e n c e s ( 5 ¶CAACGGATTTGGTCGTATT-3¶, 5¶-GACCTCAACTACATGGTTT-3¶, 5¶TGGTTTACATGTTCCAATA-3¶, 5¶-GTCAACGGATTTGGTCGTA-3¶). EphA2
levels were measured by Western blotting and ELISA, as described above.
In vivo efficacy studies. Female nude mice at 4 to 6 wk of age
(Harlan) were implanted with 5  106 PC3 cells s.c. into the right flank.
Alternatively, Fischer 344 rats (Harlan) were implanted with 5  106 F98 or
RG2 rat glioma cells s.c. in the right flank. When tumor volumes reached
f125 mm3 in the mice or 250 mm3 in the rats, the animals were
randomized into groups of 10 and dosed i.v. with the indicated treatments.
Tumor volumes were determined by measuring the length (l) and width (w)
and calculating the volume (V = lw2/2). All dilutions were made fresh in
sterile PBS.

observed in any other EphA (Fig. 1A) or EphB receptor family
members (data not shown).
After the stimulation of the EphA2 receptor on PC3 cells with
1C1 for 20 minutes, antibody internalization was detected by
immunofluorescence (Fig. 1B). These results were observed in
multiple cell types of different origins (data not shown). Finally,
EphA2 protein degradation was observed at 6 hours after
treatment of PC3 cells with 1C1 (Fig. 1C). These data show that
the receptor and antibody complex were being internalized and
processed through the lysosomal pathway.
The properties of 1C1 suggest that it may be a suitable candidate
for cytotoxic drug conjugation. Therefore, 1C1 was covalently linked
to an average of four MMAFs through the stable peptide linker
maleimidocaproyl, as described elsewhere (27). To confirm that the
modification of the antibody through the conjugation process did
not disrupt binding to EphA2, 1C1 and 1C1-mcMMAF were
europium labeled and tested for binding to both recombinant

Results
To produce an EphA2-specific immunoconjugate, we first
needed to identify an antibody with the appropriate characteristics. A Dyax Fab phage display library was panned and screened
to isolate clones that bound to recombinant human EphA2
extracellular domain, as described in Materials and Methods.
Selected antibody fragments with unique sequences were
converted to full-length human IgG1 antibodies. Full-length
antibodies were then screened for their ability to specifically
bind and internalize human and mouse EphA2. Antibody clone
1C1 showed binding to recombinant human and mouse EphA2
receptor extracellular domain (Fig. 1A). Binding of 1C1 was not

EphA2 and EphA2-expressing cells. No dramatic differences were
observed between the binding of the conjugated and unconjugated
1C1 antibodies to recombinant EphA2 or EphA2-expressing cells
(Table 1). Furthermore, no differences were observed between the
abilities of the conjugated and unconjugated 1C1 antibodies to
induce antibody internalization (Fig. 2A) and EphA2 degradation
(Fig. 2B). The K d values of 1C1 binding to purified EphA2 of human,
mouse, rat, or cynomolgus monkey origin ranged between 0.43 and
0.96 nmol/L (Table 1). These findings were further corroborated by
BiaCore analysis, wherein 1C1 binding to recombinant EphA2 ECD
was determined to be f1 nmol/L (data not shown). In the case of
binding to human EphA2 expressed on PC3, rat EphA2 expressed on

F98 cells, or cynomolgus monkey EphA2 expressed on Chinese
hamster ovary (CHO) cells, K d values of f1.0 and 1.5 nmol/L were
calculated for both the conjugated and unconjugated antibodies,
respectively (Table 1). 1C1 and 1C1-mcMMAF internalization was
observed 20 minutes after addition of the antibodies to PC3 cells
(Fig. 2A). Lastly, 6 hours after addition of either 1C1 or 1C1mcMMAF to PC3 or F98 cells resulted in reduced EphA2 protein
levels (Fig. 2B). These data show that the binding activity to both
recombinant and native EphA2 was comparable between conjugated and unconjugated 1C1 antibodies. These data also suggest that
the ability of the conjugated and unconjugated 1C1 antibodies to be
internalized and to induce EphA2 degradation in cells were similar.

To test whether 1C1-mcMMAF could kill cells expressing EphA2,
we incubated the conjugate on PC3 cells for 72 hours
and measured cell viability. 1C1-mcMMAF was able to specifically
kill PC3 cells in a dose-dependent manner, whereas conjugated
control IgG had no effect (Fig. 2C). As seen previously with other
agonistic EphA2 antibodies, unconjugated 1C1 antibody did not
have any effect on monolayer cell growth (30). The auristatins
are known to disrupt the dynamics of tubulin polymerization,
sending the cells into growth arrest followed by cell death (31).
Consequently, 1C1-mcMMAF induced caspase-3/caspase-7 activity
after treatment of cells, whereas control treatments were
ineffective (Fig. 2C). These effects were not specific for PC3 cells,
as EphA2-expressing cells of different tumor, species, and cell
origins were growth inhibited by 1C1-mcMMAF to varying degrees
(Table 2). Interestingly, 1C1 conjugate also induced cell death in
‘‘activated’’ endothelial cells that were grown in complete media
containing the supplied endothelial growth factors. These results
suggest that proliferating blood vessels, such as those found around
growing tumors, may also serve as a potential target for 1C1mcMMAF.
Whereas there seemed to be a lack of correlation between total
EphA2 receptor levels and the ability of 1C1 conjugate to kill cells
(Table 2), a certain level of EphA2 receptor expression on the
surface of cells was needed for the conjugate to inhibit growth. A
number of cell lines that express little to no EphA2, like SKBR3
breast tumor cells and RG2 rat glioma cells, were unaffected by
treatment with 1C1-mcMMAF (Table 2). To further examine the
specificity of cell killing with the conjugate, EphA2 receptor
expression was reduced in PC3 cells by RNA interference (RNAi)
before exposure to 1C1-mcMMAF. The levels of receptors
remaining in EphA2 siRNA-treated cells compared with controltreated cells were measured by Western blot and ELISA from
whole-cell extracts of duplicate wells. Maximal knockdown of
EphA2 was observed between 48 and 72 hours after transient
transfection with only 10% of the protein remaining compared
with control-treated cells (Fig. 3A). The cytotoxicity of 1C1mcMMAF on PC3 cells was lost when 1C1 conjugate was added
48 hours after transfection with EphA2 siRNA compared with
control siRNA-treated cells, suggesting that EphA2 receptor is
required to mediate the effects of the conjugate (Fig. 3B). At
144 hours after transfection, EphA2 protein levels recovered 47%

www.aacrjournals.org

of control and cell killing activity of the conjugate was mostly
regained (Fig. 3B). These data further support the specificity of
1C1 conjugate targeting of EphA2 receptor expressed on cells and
suggest that there may be a threshold level of cell surface
receptor required for the conjugate to kill cells in vitro. This
observation is also in agreement with data wherein an EphrinA1–
P. aeruginosa exotoxin A conjugate was used to treat glioblastoma
multiforme (21).
With in vitro potency and specificity confirmed, we sought to
characterize 1C1-mcMMAF activity in vivo. Previous positron
emission tomography imaging studies of radiolabeled 1C1 confirmed that the antibody was accumulating in EphA2-expressing
tumor xenografts, but not in normal mouse or rat organs (32). To
determine if 1C1-mcMMAF penetrated the tumor and degraded
EphA2 in vivo, receptor levels were monitored from tumor
homogenates at various times after i.v. administration of the
conjugate. Both 1 and 5 mg/kg of 1C1-mcMMAF were capable
of inducing degradation of f60% of the total EphA2 protein by
1 hour after treatment (Fig. 3C). Greater than 90% of the tumorderived EphA2 was eliminated after a single i.v. dose of 5 mg/kg
of 1C1-mcMMAF 24 hours after administration, and this was
maintained for the duration of the 6-day study. A single dose of
10 mg/kg of 1C1-mcMMAF did not show any improvement in the
extent of EphA2 degradation compared with the 5 mg/kg dose
level (data not shown). EphA2 levels fluctuated between 20% and
50% of control in the three mice treated with 1 mg/kg with some
trend of recovery toward days 5 and 6. These data show that 1C1mcMMAF dose-dependently penetrated the tumor, internalized,
and degraded the EphA2 receptor in vivo.
The in vivo degradation of EphA2 also suggested that 1C1mcMMAF was able to enter tumor cells to deliver the cytotoxic
payload. To determine the effects of the conjugate on tumor
growth, PC3 tumor-bearing mice were treated once weekly with an
i.v. injection of 1C1-mcMMAF for a total of 5 weeks (Fig. 4A).
Significant tumor growth inhibition was observed at the 1 and
3 mg/kg dose groups relative to the control groups. A dose response
was observed, wherein 3 mg/kg of 1C1-mcMMAF treatment
resulted in tumor regressions, 1 mg/kg treatment resulted in tumor
stasis, and 0.1 mg/kg treatment had no effect on tumor growth. This
activity was specific because the combination of 1C1-mcMMAF and
a 10-fold excess of unconjugated 1C1, which had no antitumor
activity by itself (data not shown), was able to block the activity of
the 1C1-mcMMAF. In addition, treatment of mice with an IgG
control conjugate had no effect on tumor growth at comparable
doses (Fig. 4A).
There were no animal deaths or moribund mice in the studies.
Mouse body weights were unaffected in all treatment groups in the
xenograft studies (data not shown). Although 1C1-mcMMAF
treatment did not result in overt toxicities, mice have been
reported to be less sensitive to Dolastatin 10, the parent compound
to MMAF, compared with rats (33). Because 1C1-mcMMAF binds
to rat EphA2 and rats are more sensitive to Dolastatin 10, we
evaluated 1C1-mcMMAF in two syngeneic rat glioma tumor
models. The rat glioma cell line expressed high levels of EphA2,
whereas the RG2 cells did not express high levels of EphA2 as
measured by FACS. Similar to the findings in the nude mouse
xenografts, 1C1-mcMMAF significantly diminished syngeneic
EphA2-expressing F98 tumor growth in the immunocompetent
rats compared with controls (Fig. 4B), whereas the non–EphA2expressing RG2 tumors were unaffected by treatment with 1C1mcMMAF (Fig. 4C). Body weights were unchanged compared with

controls at doses up to 10 mg/kg, the highest dose given (data not
shown). These data support the hypothesis that 1C1-mcMMAF can
deliver sufficient quantities of cytotoxic drug to control tumor
growth without overt side effects. Histopathology and serum
chemistry studies are ongoing to assess the potential toxicities
associated with 1C1-mcMMAF treatment.

Discussion
Immunoconjugates harness the potency of cytotoxics delivered
with the specificity of antibodies. Here, we describe a unique
antibody-drug conjugate that is capable of specifically delivering a
microtubule disrupting agent auristatin to EphA2-expressing
tumors. The antibody 1C1 selectively bound, activated, internalized, and degraded human and rodent EphA2 receptor on cells.

Figure 4. 1C1-mcMMAF inhibits tumor growth in vivo. A, nude mice bearing
preestablished s.c. PC3 tumors were treated with once weekly i.v. doses of PBS,
control IgG-mcMMAF, 1C1-mcMMAF, or a mixture of 1C1-mcMMAF plus a
10-fold excess of unconjugated 1C1. B, Fischer 344 rats bearing preestablished
s.c. F98 rat glioma tumors (EphA2-expressing) were treated with once-weekly
i.v. doses of PBS, IgG, and 1C1 conjugates. Arrows indicate the start of
treatment. The 1 and 3 mg/kg 1C1-mcMMAF groups from the PC3 study and the
2.5, 5, and 10 mg/kg 1C1-mcMMAF groups from the F98 study are significantly
different than the respective PBS and control IgG-mcMMAF treated groups
(P < 0.0001). C, Fischer 344 rats bearing preestablished s.c. RG2 rat glioma
tumors (non–EphA2-expressing) were treated with once-weekly i.v. doses of
PBS or 1C1-mcMMAF at 5 mg/kg. Arrows indicate the start of treatment. No
inhibition of tumor growth was observed in the 1C1-mcMMAF treatment group.

Figure 3. Inhibition of EphA2 expression by RNAi protects PC3 cells from
1C1-mcMMAF–mediated cell death. A, the levels of EphA2 and GAPDH proteins
were measured from PC3 cell lysates at the indicated times after transient
transfection with EphA2, GAPDH, or negative control siRNA. Quantities of
EphA2 in whole-cell lysates measured by ELISA are expressed as a percentage
of EphA2 levels measured in control siRNA-treated cells and listed below
each lane in the Western blot (% Control). B, increasing concentrations of
1C1-mcMMAF were incubated with PC3 cells either 48 or 144 h after transfection

EphA2 levels was performed on tumor homogenates harvested from mice at the
indicated times after i.v. administration of either 1 or 5 mg/kg of 1C1-mcMMAF.

When coupled to MMAF, the conjugate was capable of specifically
inducing caspase-mediated cell death in EphA2 expressing cells.
The ability of 1C1 conjugate to cross-react with rodent EphA2
receptor enabled us to show in vivo tumor activity without
observable host toxicity.
To maximize the potential therapeutic window, it is critical for
expression of an immunoconjugate target to be highly tumorselective. EphA2 protein has been shown to be overexpressed in
>50% of patients with cancer of the ovary, prostate, colon, and
brain (7). Cultured cell models representing these tumor types were
inhibited after treatment of 1C1-mcMMAF. Whereas the expression
of EphA2 receptor in human cancer has been well established, little
is known about the normal adult tissue expression and function.
The expression of EphA2 mRNA and protein in normal adult rat
tissues has been described in epithelial cells of the kidney and lung

EphA2 Immunoconjugate Blocks Tumor Growth

(34). Similar analysis has detected EphA2 mRNA in adult human
tissues of the kidney and lung, as well as colon and bladder (35).
However, mRNA levels do not always predict protein levels of
EphA2 (13, 36). Imaging analysis using a radiolabeled version of the
highly selective antibody 1C1, which binds both human and rodent
EphA2, revealed preferential distribution to tumors with no
accumulation in any normal mouse or rat tissues (32). The
in vivo data presented herein show that effective tumor cell killing
can be achieved with 1C1-mcMMAF without any observable side
effects to the animals, suggesting that targeting of the conjugate
to normal mouse and rat tissues is minimal. We should note that
the 1C1–maleimidocaproyl-valine-citrulline–MMAE (vcMMAE) antibody-drug conjugate inhibited cell growth at similar potencies as
1C1-mcMMAF, but 1C1-mcMMAF had superior in vivo tolerability
compared with the 1C1-vcMMAE antibody-drug conjugate (data
not shown). In fact, in a single-dose tolerability study, doses of
1C1-mcMMAF above 100 mg/kg in mice resulted in similar targetindependent findings observed previously for CD30-mcMMAF
antibody conjugates in rats (27). Based on these data, EphA2
receptor seems to be an attractive target for selective immunoconjugate therapy.
EphA2 has also been shown to be up-regulated in the neovasculature of tumors in both mouse and human (37). Like these
tumor endothelial cells, HUVECs also express EphA2 receptor
(34, 38). Interestingly, when these cells are cultured in growth
factor–containing media, 1C1-mcMMAF can inhibit their growth
with an IC50 only 10-fold higher compared with the most sensitive
tumor cells. Given these in vitro results, it is possible that targeting
EphA2 with 1C1-mcMMAF in vivo could result in disruption of the
tumor vasculature. This may contribute to the in vivo efficacy
observed in the mouse and rat tumor studies, as it is wellestablished that microtubule targeting agents have vascular
modulation activity (39). Thus, targeting of EphA2 with 1C1mcMMAF offers a unique opportunity to block tumor growth
through two distinct mechanisms, directly through tumor cell
cytotoxicity and indirectly through antiangiogenic activity.
Targeting EphA2 with an antibody-drug conjugate may elicit
effects on cell signaling that may also contribute to the activity of
the drug. Interestingly, only 16,000 EphA2 receptor 1C1 binding
sites per PC3 cell were determined by Scatchard analysis. This is
relatively low compared with the f300,000 binding sites per cell
required for an auristatin antibody-drug conjugate targeting EphB2
to produce an IC50 comparable with 1C1-mcMMAF treatment of
PC3 cells (40). In the same cell background, 100-fold more
conjugate was needed to elicit similar activity in cells with
f71,000 copies of EphB2 per cell. It is possible the EphA2 receptor
agonist activity of the 1C1 antibody is sensitizing tumors to
auristatin activity. Previous studies support this hypothesis. For
example, EphA2 stimulation was shown to attenuate growth

factor–induced Ras activation (16). Although unconjugated 1C1 did
not show any direct inhibition of tumor growth in this study,
agonistic antibodies have been shown to inhibit tumor formation
in some transgenic and xenograft mouse models of cancer (17, 18,
41). In fact, one study has shown an additive effect on tumor
inhibition in vivo when EphA2 antibodies are combined with the
microtubule disrupting agent paclitaxel (18). Thus, activation and
degradation of EphA2 after treatment with 1C1-mcMMAF may
sensitize cells to proapoptotic stimuli, such as microtubule
disruption.
Despite the marketed approval of the antibody-drug conjugate
gemtuzumab ozogamicin (Mylotarg), previous attempts at developing toxin-conjugated antibodies for cancer therapy have
encountered several challenges, which include poor antibody
conjugate stability, low drug potency, difficulty releasing active
drug, and high immunogenicity (42–44). However, significant
advances in immunoconjugate technology have yielded more
stable and less immunogenic therapeutics to maximize the
therapeutic window. First, advances in antibody technology have
produced human antibodies with little to no immunogenicity in
patients (43). Second, highly potent small molecule drugs like
auristatins with a clinically proven mechanism of action that
interferes with tubulin polymerization can be covalently linked to
antibodies (24). The derivative MMAF used in the current study is
on its own less cell permeable than previously used forms of the
drug, allowing for potentially less toxicity and greater specificity in
the event that the drug is released into systemic circulation (27).
Finally, peptide linker chemistry has made significant advancements to improve immunoconjugate stability. Previous studies
have shown that the maleimidocaproyl linker described herein was
not susceptible to cleavage by any human enzymes tested and that
lysosomal degradation of the antibody, not the linker, resulted in
release of the active drug product inside cells (27). We believe these
significant technical advancements, incorporated into an immunoconjugate that selectively targets the receptor tyrosine kinase
EphA2, create a powerful combination for the treatment of solid
tumors.
