Oxidative stress downstream of mTORC1 but not AKT
causes a proliferative defect in cancer cells resistant to
PI3K inhibition

Compounds targeting phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/mammalian target of rapamycin (PI3K/mTOR) signaling are being investigated
in multiple clinical settings, but drug resistance may reduce their beneﬁt. Compound rechallenge after drug holidays can overcome
such resistance, yet little is known about the impact of drug holidays on cell biochemistry. We found that PI3K inhibitor (PI3Ki)resistant cells cultured in the absence of PI3Ki developed a proliferative defect, increased oxygen consumption and accumulated
reactive oxygen species (ROS), leading to lactate production through hypoxia-inducible factor-1α. This metabolic imbalance was
reversed by mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) inhibitors. Interestingly, neither AKT nor c-MYC was involved in
mediating the metabolic phenotype, despite the latter contributing to resistant cells’ proliferation. These data suggest that an AKTindependent PI3K/mTORC1 axis operates in these cells. The excessive ROS hampered cell division, and the metabolic phenotype
made resistant cells more sensitive to hydrogen peroxide and nutrient starvation. Thus, the proliferative defect of PI3Ki-resistant
cells during drug holidays is caused by defective metabolic adaptation to chronic PI3K/mTOR pathway inhibition. This metabolic
imbalance may open the therapeutic window for challenge with metabolic drugs during drug holidays.

INTRODUCTION
Phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin (PI3K/AKT/mTOR) signaling has key roles in the regulation of
cell growth, survival, motility and bioenergetic metabolism, and it
is one of the most frequently mutated pathways in cancer.1
Consequently, small-molecule inhibitors targeting the PI3K pathway are being developed at a rapid pace, and both preclinical and
early clinical studies are beginning to suggest strategies for their
effective therapeutic use.2 Experience with other successful
targeted agents, however, suggests that resistance is likely to
reduce the durability of any clinical beneﬁt.3,4
The drug holiday strategy (drug removal followed by rechallenge) has been successfully used to overcome resistance in
melanoma, chronic myeloid leukemia and lung cancer cells
treated with the kinase inhibitors vemurafenib, imatinib and
erlotinib, respectively.5–7 In a heterogeneous tumor environment,
resistant cells develop a proliferative disadvantage during
drug removal, resulting in their replacement by sensitive cells.
The proliferative disadvantage suffered by resistant cells in the
absence of drug is considered as a key event for the success of this
strategy.6 The molecular mechanisms that give rise to this deﬁcit
in proliferation are poorly understood, and a better knowledge
could be used to develop strategies to improve the response of
patients treated with signaling inhibitors.
The overactivation of the c-Myc oncogene has been identiﬁed
as a mechanism of acquired resistance to PI3K inhibition in several
preclinical studies.8–10 Resistance to inhibitors of the PI3K/AKT/
mTOR axis may also arise by the activation of parallel pathways,

such as RAF/MEK/ERK11 and EGFR/PKC (epidermal growth factor
receptor/protein kinase C) signaling axes.12
Here, we aimed to understand the adaptations that occur in
cells with acquired resistance to PI3K/mTOR inhibitors and the
impact of drug holidays on cell biochemistry. We found that
resistant cells adapted their metabolic homeostasis to compensate for chronic PI3K pathway inhibition and underwent profound
metabolic changes after drug deprivation (that is, in drug holidays
conditions). Interestingly, these alterations included an increase of
glycolytic activity that in other systems is known to promote cell
proliferation.13 The accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS),
however, not only prevented resistant cells from recovering the
division rate of parental cells but was also detrimental to their
proliferation. We found that ROS were produced in a mammalian
target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1)-dependent, but
AKT-independent, manner and mediated glycolytic activity via
hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF), but not c-MYC. Our results suggest
that a metabolic imbalance is not only a hallmark of cancer, but it
also causes resistant cancer cells on drug holidays to acquire a
proliferative defect that could be enhanced with additional
oxidative challenge.
RESULTS
Cells with chronic inhibition of PI3K develop a proliferative defect
and a hypermetabolic phenotype during drug holidays
To investigate the biochemical adaptations that occur in cells with
acquired resistance to PI3K inhibition, we used three independent

Metabolic defects in PI3K inhibitor-resistant cells

cell lines (named G1, G2 and G3) derived from chronic treatment
of the MCF7 cell line with the PI3K class IA-speciﬁc inhibitor
GDC-0941 (PI3Ki, Figure 1a and Supplementary Figure S1a).14
Resistant cells were able to proliferate—although at slower rate
than parental cells—in the presence of 1 μM of compound,
whereas parental cells could not (Figure 1a and Supplementary
Figure S1a). Of note, none of the resistant cells recovered the
proliferation rate of the parental cells upon drug withdrawal
(Figure 1a). Interestingly, G1 and G2 grew even slower in the
absence rather than in the presence of the drug (Figure 1a). These
data suggest that PI3Ki-resistant cells have developed a proliferative defect that is manifested during drug holidays, with G1
and G2 even showing a potential addiction to the PI3Ki.
Drug withdrawal caused a substantial acidiﬁcation of the media
(that was greater in G2), suggesting a metabolic alteration
(Figure 1b). This difference in metabolic rate was associated with
an increased redox activity after compound withdrawal
(Figure 1c), and was a reversible process, as drug readministration
restored the initial phenotype (Supplementary Figure S1b).
To determine the enzymes involved in the metabolic phenotype,
we measured the transcriptional expression of metabolic genes. This
analysis showed a different expression pattern of metabolic enzymes
between parental and resistant cells (Supplementary Figure S1c).
Mass spectrometry-based proteomics analysis showed that resistant
cells increased the expression of lactate dehydrogenase A, fatty
acid synthetase, isocitrate dehydrogenase 3A and thiorredoxin-like
protein that are involved in production of lactic acid, fatty acid
metabolism, tricarboxylic acid cycle and electron transport chain,
respectively. On drug removal, resistant cells expressed proteins
involved in the pentose phosphate pathway and gluconeogenesis,
including glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 2, respectively (Figure 1d). Immunoblotting
analysis conﬁrmed the expression changes of fatty acid synthetase
and lactate dehydrogenase B (Figure 1d).
To characterize the metabolic alterations in more detail, we
measured mitochondrial (oxygen consumption rate (OCR)) and
glycolytic (extracellular acidiﬁcation rate (ECAR)) activities as well
as lactic acid levels in the media (Figure 1e). We found that drug
removal produced an increase in both ECAR and lactic acid in all
resistant cells (Figure 1e). OCR was also signiﬁcantly increased
upon drug removal in G1 and G2; however, in G3 this increase did
not reach statistical signiﬁcance (Figure 1e). Taken together, these
results indicate that placing PI3Ki-resistant cells in drug holiday
conditions induces a hypermetabolic phenotype characterized by
an increase in both glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration.
We observed that the development of the metabolic phenotype
was associated with an increase in cell size (Figure 1f), and with a
slow cell cycle progression from G0/G1 to S phase (Supplementary
Figure S1d) without affecting apoptosis (Supplementary
Figure S1e). These data indicate that the drug holiday-induced
metabolic changes contributed to the production of cell biomass,
but instead of being used to proliferate, PI3Ki-resistant cells
diverted such biomass to increase size.
PI3Ki-resistant cells in drug holidays reactivate PI3K/mTORC1
signaling that mediates the hypermetabolic phenotype
independently of AKT
Markers of mTORC2, AKT and mTORC1 activities (namely phosphorylations at AKT Ser473, PRAS40 Thr246 and 4E-BP1 Thr37/46,
respectively) remained inhibited in resistant cells growing in the
presence of PI3Ki (Figure 2a and Supplementary Figure S2a). On drug
holidays, phosphorylation on these markers dramatically increased
relative to the same cell line growing exposed to the PI3Ki, although
the extent of such reactivation was different across G1, G2 and G3
cell lines (Figure 2a and Supplementary Figure S2a).
To determine the components involved in the development of
the metabolic phenotype, we measured cell viability and media

acidiﬁcation as a function of treatment with inhibitors of the PI3K
cascade15–19 (Figure 2b). PI3Ki-resistant cells were crossresistant to
AKT and mTORC1/2 inhibition (Figure 2c, top panels), indicating
that these cells had developed the ability to survive in the absence
of PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway activity.
The mTORC1/2 and mTORC1 inhibitors prevented media
acidiﬁcation in all resistant cell lines (Figure 2c, bottom panels).
For example, G2 acidiﬁed the media to pH 7.2 (normal media pH is
8.0); the pH of cells treated with PI3Ki, mTORC1/2i or mTORC1i
remained at pH of 7.8, 7.8 and 8.0, respectively (Figure 2c, bottom
panel). Surprisingly, we found that G2 cells treated with two
different AKT inhibitors acidiﬁed the media to the same extent as
untreated cells (pH 7.3 and 7.2). Similar results for pH values were
observed for the G1 and G3 cell lines (Figure 2c, bottom panels).
Inhibition of SGK (serum- and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase)
with GSK-650394 (ref.20) did not prevent the metabolic phenotype
(Figure 2c, bottom panels). Thus, SGK, a signaling mediator that
can occasionally substitute AKT,21 did not replace AKT signaling in
our model of drug resistance.
To investigate the relevance and extent of AKT-independent
PI3K/mTOR signaling in our model, we compared the effects of
PI3Ki, mTORC1/2i and AKTi2 on the phosphoproteome of G2 cells
(Figure 2d and Supplementary Figures S2b and c). PI3Ki and
mTORC1/2i inhibited the phosphorylation of 90 and 99 sites,
respectively, whereas AKTi2 only inhibited the phosphorylation of
24 sites (at P o0.05, log2 fold o − 1, n = 4, Figure 2d). Of note,
PI3K and mTORC1/2 inhibitors, but not the AKTi2, reduced the
phosphorylation of the EIF4E-BP2 (Ser44/Thr45), a downstream
mTORC1 target (Figure 2e). In contrast, mTORC1/2, AKT and PI3K
inhibitors blocked the phosphorylation of the AKT substrate
PRAS40 (Thr246), as determined by liquid chromatography–mass
spectrometry (Figure 2e). Western blot analysis also showed that
PRAS40 (Thr246) phosphorylation was inhibited by AKTi. The
mTORC1 inhibition with everolimus reduced the phosphorylation
of 4E-BP1 (Thr37/46), whereas AKTi did not reduce the phosphorylation at this site (Figure 2f). Together, these data demonstrate
that an AKT-independent PI3K/mTORC1 signaling axis is functional
in our cell model of drug resistance and that this pathway is
involved in the mediation of the metabolic phenotype.
c-MYC, CAMKII and MEK activities have a role in the viability of
PI3Ki-resistant cells but are not responsible for the hypermetabolic
phenotype
To better understand signaling changes in resistant cells, we
analyzed the phosphoproteomes of parental and resistant cells in
the presence or absence of PI3Ki (Supplementary Figure S3a). Of the
5674 phosphopeptides quantiﬁed in these experiments, 2166 were
signiﬁcantly altered (at Po0.05 and log2 fold o − 1 or 41) in at
least one condition. Unsupervised clustering (using a k-means
algorithm) grouped phosphopeptides that signiﬁcantly increased
(clusters 1–2) or decreased (4 and 6) in resistant compared with
parental cells (Figure 3a and Supplementary Dataset S2). Substates
for MEK and CAMKII were enriched in cluster 1, suggesting that these
kinases were more active in resistant relative to parental cells
(Figure 3a and Supplementary Figure S3b). To determine whether
MEK and/or CAMKII could mediate resistance to PI3K inhibition, we
measured proliferation of resistant cells in the presence of trametinib
(a MEK inhibitor)22 or KN-93 (a CAMKII inhibitor).23 As predicted, PI3Ki
potentiated the effects of trametinib and KN-93 in PI3Ki-resistant cells
(Figure 3b). However, treatment with trametinib or KN-93 did not
avoid the appearance of the metabolic phenotype (Supplementary
Figure S3c).
Of interest, Figure 3c shows that resistant cells increased the
phosphorylation of c-MYC at sites (Thr58/Ser62) known to promote
c-MYC transcriptional activity.24 Gene expression and western blot
analysis suggested that this increase in phosphorylation may be
because of a higher expression of mRNA and protein levels

(Figure 3c and Supplementary Figure S1d). In addition, pathway
enrichment analysis against the NCI pathway database revealed
that proteins listed within the process ‘validated targets of c-MYC
transcriptional activation’ were increased in resistant relative to
parental cells (Figure 3d and Supplementary Dataset S1).

c-MYC activity contributes to acquired resistance to PI3K inhibitors
in other models.8–10 We inhibited c-MYC using two different
competitive inhibitors of the c-MYC/MAX interaction (10058-F4;
c-MYC inhibitor 1 (ref.25) and 10074-G5; c-MYC inhibitor 2 (ref.26)).
We found that although in isolation PI3K and c-MYC inhibitors had

a modest effect on reducing cell proliferation of resistant cells,
concomitant inhibition of PI3K and c-MYC activity reduced cell
number by approximately threefold relative to untreated cells

(Figure 3e). Surprisingly, inhibition of c-MYC did not prevent the
ability of resistant cells to acidify the media (Figure 3f and
Supplementary Figure S3c). Overall, our results indicate that

Figure 4. HIF activity is responsible for lactic acid production in PI3Ki-resistant cells during drug holidays. (a) HIF-1α protein expression.
(b) HIF1 transcriptional activity. Data are represented as mean ± s.d. (n = 3, three independent replicates). (c) Relative cell numbers and pH
values from cell media cultured for 5 days with chetomin (HIFi), PI3Ki or the combination. (d) Media lactic acid concentration as a function of

although the activities of CAMKII, MEK and c-MYC help resistant
cells to survive in a background of chronic PI3K/mTOR inhibition,
these proteins do not regulate the metabolic phenotype in these
models.27
HIF activity regulates the glycolytic phenotype in PI3Ki-resistant
cells
In addition to c-MYC, bioenergetic metabolic pathways are
regulated by the transcription factor HIF.28 We found that the
process ‘HIF-1α transcription factor network’ was also enriched in

resistant cells (Figure 3d). We therefore investigated HIF-1α
protein expression and found that resistant cells growing in the
absence of drug had greater HIF-1α protein than parental cells;
this expression decreased dramatically in cells treated with PI3Ki
(Figure 4a and Supplementary Figure S4a). Consistent with the
immunoblot data (Figure 4a), HIF transcriptional activities were
between 3.3- and 13.6-fold greater in resistant cells grown in the
absence of the PI3Ki than in its presence (Figure 4b).
To assess the role of HIF in the development29 of the
hypermetabolic phenotype, we inhibited their activities using
chetomin, a disruptor of the HIF/p300 interaction.30 Chetomin

reduced media acidiﬁcation to similar levels as when cells were
treated with PI3Ki (Figure 4c and Supplementary Figure S4b), and
also reduced cell division rates of parental cells; however, G1 and
G2 proliferation rates were not signiﬁcantly affected by inhibition
of HIF isoforms (Figure 4c). We observed that HIF inhibition caused
a signiﬁcant decrease in lactic acid content in the media of
parental and resistant cells (Figure 4d). Thus, an increase in HIF
activities (involving at least HIF-1α), known to act downstream of
different oncogenes,31 regulates the phenotype of our models of
PI3Ki-resistant cells.
ROS overproduction on drug removal activates HIF and causes a
defect on the proliferation of resistant cells that can be recovered
by antioxidants
A gene ontology analysis of our phosphoproteomics data showed
that antioxidant activity (GO: 0016209) was signiﬁcantly enriched
in resistant cells during drug holidays (Figure 5a). Antioxidant
activity may be increased in these cells to counteract by-products
of metabolism such as ROS that are expected to increase as a
result of high metabolic activity.32 To further investigate the
involvement of mitochondria in our model, we measured ROS, a
natural end product of mitochondrial activity. Untreated G2 and
G1 cells produced approximately twofold more ROS than the
same cells treated with PI3Ki and parental cells (Figure 5b and
Supplementary Figure S5a). PI3Ki-resistant cells increased ROS
production during drug holidays but, as noted above (Figure 1),
these differed in their extent of metabolic dysregulation.
Because a high intracellular ROS concentration can be toxic,32,33
we hypothesized that increased ROS levels contributed to the
defective proliferation of resistant cells. We tested whether
reducing ROS with the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC)34–36
would increase the proliferation of resistant cells. After
conﬁrming that NAC was a free radical quencher in our model
(Supplementary Figure S5b), we found that reduction of ROS by
NAC restored the proliferation of cells with elevated metabolism
and high ROS levels (G1 and G2 cell lines growing in the absence
of PI3Ki;Figure 5c and Supplementary Figure S5b). Conversely,
proliferation of cells with lower metabolism and ROS was impaired
by NAC (Figure 5c).
Similarly, the lipophilic ROS scavenger α-tocopherol37 increased
the proliferation of G2 cells growing without PI3Ki, but decreased
cell numbers when cultured with PI3Ki (Supplementary
Figure S5c). This antioxidant also decreased proliferation of
parental cells (Supplementary Figure S5c). Thus, the loss of ROS
homeostasis that occurred in G1 and G2 cells after drug removal
(probably because of an increase of the OCR; Figure 1f) was
responsible for their proliferative defect. In contrast, ROS levels
were lower in G3 cells (probably because they did not suffer a
signiﬁcant increase of OCR; Figure 1f) and, consequently, these
cells did not experience a proliferative defect. ROS can stabilize
HIF.38 ROS scavenging with NAC decreased HIF-1α protein
expression in the resistant cell lines grown without PI3Ki to that
of expression in parental cells (Figure 5d) and signiﬁcantly
reduced the levels of lactic acid in all PI3Ki-resistant cells; this
effect being greater in G1 and G2 grown without PI3Ki (Figure 5e).
To delineate in more detail the pathway that leads to ROS
production in PI3Ki-resistant cells, we measured cellular ROS after
the inhibition of several PI3K pathway members. Treatment of
resistant cells that present high oxidative stress (G1 and G2) with
PI3Ki, mTORC1/2i and mTORC1i reduced ROS levels, whereas
inhibitors of AKT, SGK, CAMKII or MEK were unable to prevent the
increase of ROS (Figure 5f and Supplementary Figure S5d).
Similarly, neither c-MYC nor HIF inhibition reduced ROS accumulation (Figure 5f and Supplementary Figure S5d).
Together, the data in Figure 5 reinforce the notion that PI3Kiresistant cells develop an oxidative phenotype during drug
holidays that is dependent on PI3K and mTORC1, but does not
Oncogene (2017) 2762 – 2774

require AKT, SGK, CAMK, MEK or c-MYC to generate ROS that
controls HIF-1α to regulate the glycolytic phenotype.
The high metabolic activity of resistant cells may be exploited to
potentiate the proliferative defect induced during drug holidays
We hypothesized that PI3Ki-resistant cells in drug holidays would
be more sensitive to an additional oxidative challenge.39,40 Thus,
we used H2O2 to increase the oxidative stress in sensitive and
resistant cells.41 Interestingly, H2O2 signiﬁcantly reduced the
numbers of G1 and G2 cells in growing without PI3Ki to a greater
extent than the same cells growing with PI3Ki (Figure 6a).
We then examined whether the elevated metabolic rate was
functionally associated with higher nutrient demand. For this
purpose, we measured the viability of cells cultured in glucoseand glutamine-free media, as these nutrients serve as primary
sources of carbon for adenosine triphosphate production.42 The
absence of PI3Ki made resistant cells more sensitive to glucose
and glutamine withdrawal than those cultured with PI3Ki, and the
extent of the sensitivity was proportional to the intensity of the
glycolytic phenotype (Figures 6b and c). Resistant cells were also
more sensitive to glucose deprivation than parental cells
(Figure 6b). Thereby, the hypermetabolic phenotype shown by
PI3Ki-resistant cells during drug holidays leads to an increased
dependency on nutrients and the higher ROS levels made cells
more susceptible to pro-oxidant treatment (Figure 6).
The extent of metabolic imbalance determines the capacity of
PI3Ki-resistant cells to proliferate
To elucidate whether bioenergetic remodeling occurs in other
models of acquired resistance to PI3K/mTOR inhibition, we
analyzed an additional panel of cells, including seven sensitive
and resistant cell line pairs derived from breast (MCF7-K1, MCF7K2 and MCF7-K3), esophagus (KYSE70 and KYSE180) and head and
neck (LB771-HNC and CAL33) (Figure 7). These cells were resistant
to PI3K/mTOR inhibition and reactivated this signaling pathway
following drug removal.12,14 Six out of seven of these resistant cell
lines did not recover the growth rate of parental cells after drug
withdrawal (Figure 7a). Two of these resistant cell lines (K2 and
KYSE70) also proliferated less efﬁciently when growing without
inhibitor in the media than when the compound was present
(Figure 7a). Drug holidays resulted in an increase in respiratory
activity in ﬁve out of seven of the cell lines tested (Figure 7b), and
ROS (Figure 7c) and glycolytic activity (Figure 7d) also increased in
four of them.
In the panel of 10 resistant cell lines, drug withdrawal led to a
reduced proliferation in four of them (G1, G2, K2 and KYSE70) and
increase in proliferation in two of them (K1 and K3) (Figure 7e,
upper panel). Notably, we found a positive correlation (R = 0.94,
P = 5.3 × 10−05) between cell proliferation and the ratio of
glycolytic activity to ROS concentration (Figure 7e, lower panel),
suggesting that the toxic effect of ROS accumulation was
counteracted by the pro-proliferative contribution of high
glycolysis. In summary, Figure 7 indicates that drug removal
causes the loss of ROS homeostasis and the increase of the
glycolytic pathway in different models of PI3K/mTOR axis
independence. The extent of glycolysis and ROS dysregulation
and their balance determine the capacity of PI3K/mTOR-resistant
cells to proliferate during drug holidays (Figure 7f).
DISCUSSION
In this study we investigated the biochemical adaptations that
allow cancer cells to compensate for chronic PI3K inhibition and
how these change during drug holidays. The results obtained from
the study of three independent cell lines derived from MCF7
breast cancer cells14 were then conﬁrmed in an independent
panel of sensitive/resistant models.12,14 In the presence of PI3K

pathway inhibitors, resistant cells proliferated at a lower rate than
the parental cells from which they originated. This proliferative
defect could not be reversed by reactivation of the PI3K/mTOR
pathway (Figures 1 and 2). Indeed, some of the resistant cells
proliferated less efﬁciently with an active PI3K pathway (during
drug holidays) than in the context of an inactive PI3K pathway
(that is, when the PI3Ki was present in the media; Figures 1 and 7).
Drug holidays reduced melanoma cells resistant to the BRAF
inhibitor vemurafenib but the underlying biochemical causes have
remained elusive.43 In our models of PI3Ki resistance, drug
withdrawal caused a proliferative defect that, interestingly, was
associated with the appearance of a metabolic phenotype
characterized by increased respiratory and glycolytic activities
(Figure 1).
Untargeted proteomics and phosphoproteomics analyses
showed that c-MYC, CAMKII and MEK activities were increased
in resistant cells. Cell proliferation was inhibited by interfering with
c-MYC, CAMKII or MEK activities, suggesting that these proteins
contributed to the PI3Ki resistance phenotype. The oncogene
c-Myc and the MAPK pathway have been previously implicated in
the ability of cells to survive without PI3K.9–11 However, c-MYC,
CAMKII or MEK were not involved in the metabolic phenotype of
our models. In contrast, this hypermetabolism could be reversed
by inhibiting mTORC1/2 or PI3K but not by AKT or SGK inhibitors,
implying that, contrary to the canonical understanding of PI3K
signaling, these cells possess a PI3K/mTORC1 axis that is
independent of AKT. This notion was also supported by
phosphoproteomics data showing that PI3K and mTORC1/2
blockade reduced the phosphorylation of a large number of sites
that were insensitive to AKT inactivation (Figure 2).
Oncogene (2017) 2762 – 2774

During drug holidays PI3Ki-resistant cells reactivated the PI3K/
mTORC1 pathway, which is a positive regulator of mitochondrial
respiration,44–46 leading to a dysregulation of ROS homeostasis
that in turn hampered resistant cell proliferation (Figure 7f).
Resistant cells growing in the presence of drug adapted their ROS
levels to those of parental cells (Figure 5), suggesting that a
minimum concentration of ROS is required for their proliferation.
Free radical accumulation is toxic, whereas at lower concentrations these molecules promote cell proliferation.47,48 However,
ROS also act as second messengers to regulate the stabilization of
the transcription factor HIF-1α38 that induces the expression of
metabolic enzymes, leading to an increase in glycolytic activity.
Thus, our data imply that altered cellular metabolism is not just a
hallmark of oncogenesis, but also occurs during the acquisition of
resistance to targeted drug therapy in order to maintain ROS
homeostasis.
We observed this high metabolic phenotype in two of the initial
set of PI3Ki-resistant cell lines analyzed. To address the question of
how frequently this phenotype occurs in cells resistant to PI3K/
mTOR inhibition, we investigated whether this mechanism also
applied to three breast cancer cell lines resistant to Ku-0063794
and to four models of resistance to BYL719 (two of which were
derived from esophagus and two from head and neck cancers).
After drug removal, 9/10 of these models did not recover the
proliferative capacity of parental cells despite reactivating
mTORC1. Respiration, ROS production and glycolytic activity were
increased in seven, six and seven of these models, respectively.
Despite the variability in the extent of the metabolic dysregulation, a common feature across all the resistant models analyzed
was that these showed a remarkable association between cell

proliferation and the ratio of glycolytic activity to ROS levels
(Figure 7e). This observation supports the notion that the
metabolic status of PI3Ki-resistant cells determines their ability
to proliferate.
The hypermetabolic phenotype suggests new therapeutic
opportunities as adjuvant to the drug holiday strategy. Increased
glycolysis during drug holidays rendered resistant cells more
sensitive to nutrient starvation, and high levels of free radicals
increased their sensitivity to further oxidative stress (Figure 6).
Drugs that cause an intracellular accumulation of lactic acid levels,
such as inhibitors of the monocarboxylate transporters49 or
compounds that inhibit free radical scavengers,32,50 could increase
the therapeutic window of these compounds, enhancing the
ability of the drug holiday strategy to delay the occurrence of
resistance to PI3Ki.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Details of reagents used in this study, including compounds, media,
antibodies and nutrients are given in Supplementary Tables S1–S4.

Cell lines
MCF7 breast cancer cell line was obtained from ATCC (HTB-22; Manassas,
VA, USA). Three cell lines resistant to GDC-0941 (G1-G3) or to Ku-0063794
(K1-K3) were obtained by exposing MCF7 cells to increasing concentrations
of the respective compound during 6 months.14 Cell pairs sensitive or
resistant to BYL719, namely CAL-33, LB771-HNC, KYSE180 and KYSE70,
were a kind gift from Dr Baselga (Human Oncology and Pathogenesis
Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA).12
Cells were maintained in humidiﬁed incubator with 5% CO2 using culture
media Dulbecco’s modiﬁed Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal
bovine serum, 100 U/ml penicillin and 1 μM of the respective compound,
except when indicated (see Supplementary Tables S1 for details of media
and compounds used for cell culture).

Cell proliferation assay
The number of viable cells was assayed using a Vi-CELL cell counter
(Beckman Coulter, Inc., Brea, CA, USA). A total of 2000 cells on 96-well
plates were analyzed by addition and 30 min of incubation of the Guava
Nexin reagent (EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) or the Guava Cell Cycle
reagent (EMD Millipore). Then, 2000 events (apoptosis assays) or 5000
events (cell cycle distribution) were acquired per sample and FSC ﬁles were
analyzed using CytoSoft software (Guava Technologies, Billerica, MA, USA).

obtained and the area under the curve was measured using Excalibur
software (version 2, Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc).

ROS measurement
ROS were assayed by addition of 10 μM dichloro-dihydro-ﬂuorescein diacetate
(DCFH-DA, Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA) for 30 min, and they were further
washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline and observed under a Nikon
eclipse CiS/Ci-L microscope and process with Nis elements D imaging software
(Nikon Instruments, Amsterdam, The Netherlands). Quantiﬁcation of ROS was
done with Image J 1.48V (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland,
USA). The mean intensity of pixel was calculated for each image. Data for each
biological replicate are the mean of seven ﬁelds per condition.

HIF transcriptional activity
Cells at 70% conﬂuence were transfected with of a plasmid (30 ng per
well). At 2 days after transfection, cells were lysed for 20 min using 1 ×
passive lysis buffer (Promega). Reporter activation was determined using
the Nano-Glo Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega). Luciferase
activity was measured using a Dynex Revelation 4.06 luminometer (Dynex
Technologies, Chantilly, VA, USA).

Microﬂuid expression of metabolic genes
Expression of 96 metabolic genes was quantiﬁed on the multiplex Fluidigm
platform following the manufactures’ instructions.

Mass spectrometry-based proteomics and phosphoprotemics
Cells from four independent biological replicates were lysed using urea
lysis buffer containing phosphatase inhibitors (1 mM Na3VO4, 1 mM NaF,
1 mM β-glycerol-phosphate and 2.5 mM Na4P2O7). Extracted proteins were
digested with trypsin and peptides analyzed in two technical replicates on
an LTQ-Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc). For
phosphoproteomics experiments, TiO2 enrichment method was used in
two independent biological replicates and run in two technical replicates
in an LTQ Orbitrap or in a Q Exactive Plus mass spectrometer (Thermo
Fisher Scientiﬁc). Mascot was used to identify peptides from tandem mass
spectrometry data. Pescal was used for label-free quantiﬁcation.14
Normalized peak areas of peptides or phosphopeptides were averaged
between replicates and fold change between conditions was calculated.
Kinase activity was estimated from phosphoproteomics data using the
kinase substrate enrichment analysis approach as previously described4
(see Supplementary Materials and methods). Data are available via
ProteomeXchange with identiﬁer PXD003594.

Statistical analysis
Metabolic assays
Oxidative capacity was measured via the MTS assay after 2 h of incubation
(Promega, Madison, WI, USA). To measure basal OCR and ECAR, 80 000 cells
per well were incubated for 24 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2 with XF assay media
(Agilent technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). To establish OCR and ECAR
values, four readings were acquired per experiment (Seahorse Bioscience,
Santa Clara, CA, USA). Culture media pH was measured using a pH meter
(Hanna Instrument). For lactate measurements, lactate was extracted from
the media after 5 days of culture and subsequently analyzed by TSQ
Vantage mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc, Waltham, MA, USA).
The parental ion mass followed on a negative mode was 89.0244 Da. For

experiment. The resulting data were considered signiﬁcant when the
P-value was o 0.05. Signiﬁcance of enrichment of kinase substrates,
ontologies and pathways in each cluster was determined by the
hypergeometric test. For cell viability assays, bioenergetic assays, microscopic ﬂuorescence data and proteomics data, paired Student’s t-tests
were performed following the assumption of normal distribution and
equal variance of the data.

and 1 mM NaF, cells were lysed with a Triton base buffer supplemented

Figure 7. The balance between glycolytic and oxidative metabolic activities determines the proliferation of drug-resistant cells. (a) Cell
numbers of seven cell lines resistant to different PI3K/mTORC1/2 inhibitors. Cells were cultured in the presence (R+) or absence (R − ) of the
selection drug. P, parental cells. Data are mean ± s.d. of three independent biological replicates. P-values were calculated using an unpaired,
two-tailed Student’s t-test comparing conditions as indicated; *Po0.05; **Po 0.01; ***P o0.001. (b) OCR measured in the same cells as in (a).
(c) ROS measured in the same cells as in (a), and (d) ECAR measured in the same cells as in (a). (e) The glycolysis to ROS ratio associates with
the proliferation capacity of cells during drug holidays. Change in proliferation was calculated by dividing the number of viable cells
remaining after culture in drug holidays by those in cells treated with the speciﬁc inhibitor. Ratio of changes in ECAR and ROS was calculated
by dividing these values in cells in drug holiday conditions by those of cells growing in the presence of the inhibitors. Values above 1 denote
that drug removal had a positive effect on proliferation or glycolysis/ROS ratio (upper panel). The association was statistically signiﬁcant
(bottom panel). R, Pearson’s correlation value. P, P-value for Pearson’s correlation value. (f) Proposed mechanism to explain the proliferative
and metabolic alterations that occur in cells with acquired resistance to PI3K/mTOR inhibition during drug holidays.

were maintained during 30 min on ice. Proteins were quantiﬁed by BCA
(Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc) and separated by gradient gels. Primary
antibodies (see Supplementary Table S3 for details) were incubated
overnight at 4 °C and secondary antibodies were incubated for 1 h.
Detection was by enhanced chemiluminescence (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc).
