n this issue of Cancer, Burnett et al.1 report on a randomized
study in which they compared the activity of low-dose cytarabine
at a dose of 20 mg subcutaneous twice daily for 10 days versus
hydroxyurea with or without all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) in elderly
patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who were deemed
unﬁt to receive intensive chemotherapy. Low-dose cytarabine was
associated with a higher complete remission (CR) rate (18% vs 1%;
P < .001) and with longer survival (estimated 1-year survival rate,
25% vs 5%; P ¼ .0009). ATRA had no effect on the outcome.1
Therapy for elderly patients with AML is a signiﬁcant and frustrating problem. It often consists of conventional-dose cytarabine
(100–200 mg/m2 daily  5–7) and an anthracycline (eg, daunorubicin
45 mg/m2 daily 3), commonly referred to as the 3 þ 7 regimen.
These regimens have been investigated mostly in younger patients,
and many trials in AML excluded patients ages 50 to 65 years or
older. Thus, the applicability of results from the 3 þ 7 regimens to elderly patients with AML is not well known. Intensive chemotherapy
in elderly patients with AML is associated with higher inductionrelated mortality rates than in younger patients (induction mortality
rates of 20% to 50% vs 5% to 15%).2–4 A review of the Surveillance,
Epidemiology, and End Results data suggests that only 30% of elderly
patients with AML receive intensive chemotherapy; most are offered
hospice care, supportive care, or low-intensity therapies.5
The study by Burnett et al. establishes low-dose cytarabine as
an accepted standard of care in elderly patients with AML who are
deemed unﬁt for chemotherapy, against which other investigational
agents may be evaluated. This study raises several questions including: 1) the deﬁnition of elderly patients with AML who are unﬁt for
intensive chemotherapy, 2) the deﬁnition of induction mortality, and
3) the design of future pivotal studies in this setting.
The ﬁrst issue is which patients are considered elderly and unﬁt
for intensive chemotherapy. This decision often is subjective, based
on the physician’s assessment of the patients’ condition, performance status, organ functions, and existing comorbid conditions as
well as patients’ preferences once they are informed of their treatment choices and expected prognoses. The subjectivity of the process is inherent and may inject individual biases into the treatment
decisions. A better approach would base the decision on objective

criteria related to outcome of intensive therapy. For
example, if the 4- or 8-week mortality with intensive
chemotherapy is >30%, then the treatment may be
judged too risky for the beneﬁt of a complete remission (CR) rate of <50%. Achieving a CR translates
into longer survival and better quality of life, but the
beneﬁt in the total population is a combined measure of the efﬁcacy (CR rate) versus the toxicity
(induction mortality, serious morbidities) of a particular treatment. Poor prognostic factors that have
been associated with higher mortality with intensive
chemotherapy include older age, adverse chromosomal abnormalities, a performance status 2, organ
dysfunction, and therapy outside a laminar air ﬂow
room (LAFR) environment.2 Except for a performance status of 2 (which can be subjective), patients
who have a poor performance status (3 or 4) or who
have organ dysfunction usually are excluded from
clinical trials. The beneﬁt of the LAFR environment
may be restricted to the use of intensive chemotherapy and may not apply to lower intensity regimens.
The 2 consistently poor prognostic factors associated
with higher mortality from intensive chemotherapy
have been 1) age 70 years, or 2) ages 60 to 69 years
with adverse chromosomal abnormalities (deﬁned as
any nondiploide karyotype, or 3 chromosomal
abnormalities).2–4,6,7 In our review of patients aged
60 years, the ﬁrst 2 parameters (age and karyotype)
appeared to be acceptable for deﬁning unﬁtness for
chemotherapy based on high 4- and 8-week induction mortality rates (Table 1).
The deﬁnition of induction mortality in AML is
variable. Induction mortality is assumed to be death

after myelosuppression-associated complications (infections or bleeding) of a treatment. This mortality,
in fact, is a composite of 2 endpoints: myelosuppression-associated complications and/or ineffective elimination of persistent leukemia, preventing recovery of
myelosuppression. Minimizing the bias of interpreting
mortality attributable to myelosuppression versus leukemia is important in the objective interpretation of
investigational programs. We suggest reporting induction mortality as the 4-week or, preferably, the 8-week
mortality on any study, regardless of the attributed
cause of mortality by the investigator/physician. This
would provide an objective, treatment-associated,
clinically relevant, comparative endpoint across different trials.
An important question in investigational trials of
lower intensity or targeted therapies in elderly
patients with AML who are deemed unﬁt for intensive chemotherapy is the accepted level of clinical
activity associated with a preserved reduction in
morbidity and mortality that would translate into a
durable quality-of-life response or survival. This
brings into question the acceptable pivotal trial
designs. One possibility, based on the study by Burnett et al.,1 is to accept low-dose cytarabine as a
standard of care against which new treatments can
be compared until more effective treatments emerge.
Novel agents could then be compared in randomized
(classic, 2:1 randomization, Bayesian randomization,
other novel statistical designs or endpoints) trials
against low-dose cytarabine (low-dose cytarabine vs
new agent or low-dose cytarabine with or without a
new agent). An alternative approach would be to

Therapy for Elderly Patients With AML/Kantarjian

evaluate new agents in single-arm trials that set
approvable endpoints at better thresholds than those
achieved with low-dose cytarabine. Low-dose cytarabine was associated with a CR rate of 18%. Tipifarnib, a farnesyl transferase inhibitor, reportedly was
associated in the Food and Drug Administration
review with a CR rate of 11%.8 A CR without platelet
recovery to 100 109/L (CRp) also can be
included in the primary endpoint (ie, CR and CRp)
based on studies showing that CRp is associated
with better survival than no response.9,10 Thus, an
active agent in elderly patients with AML who are
deemed unﬁt for intensive chemotherapy probably
should be associated with a CR and CRp rate 30%,
durable remissions (eg, a median of 3–6 months),
and an acceptable toxicity proﬁle (eg, drug-related
mortality 10%; grade 3–4 drug-related toxicities,
20%; and 8-week mortality 15–20%). Ultimately,
any agent or strategy that is identiﬁed as beneﬁcial
and possibly is accepted for accelerated approval will
have to undergo conﬁrmatory testing in a randomized trial against an accepted form of standard
therapy.
Several investigational agents potentially may
fulﬁll these conditions. These include clofarabine,
decitabine, or azacitidine (alone or combined with
histone deacetylase inhibitors like valproic acid, suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid, MGCD0103); cloretazine; low-dose cytarabine combinations with arsenic
trioxide or gemtuzumab ozogamicin; and others.
Clofarabine is an adenosine nucleoside analogue
with structural similarity to ﬂudarabine and 2-chlorodeoxy-adenosine. Clofarabine has been approved
for the treatment of recurrent pediatric acute lymphocytic leukemia. It has also signiﬁcant activity in
AML and other myeloid disorders.11–13 In a pilot
study by Burnett et al.,14 28 elderly patients (median
age, 71 years; range, 60–79 years) with AML received
clofarabine 30 mg/m2 intravenously daily 5 for
induction followed by the same schedule for consolidation: Sixteen of 27 patients achieved CR (59%),
and 5 of 28 patients (18%) died during induction.
These results were conﬁrmed in a multi-institutional
trial. Sixty-six patients aged 65 years were treated.
Among 11 patients with unfavorable karyotypes, the
CR rate was 27%, and the overall response rate was
36%. Among 36 patients aged 70 years, the CR rate
was 44%, and the overall response rate was 56%.15 A
conﬁrmatory study of clofarabine at the same induction dose schedule is ongoing in the United States.
Decitabine and 5-azacitidine are hypomethylating agents that have been approved in the United
States for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndrome
(MDS) and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia.16–18

1009

Decitabine given at 100 mg/m2 per course at The
University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center to
115 patients with higher risk MDS was associated
with a CR rate of 37%, an overall response rate of
70% according to the modiﬁed International Working
Group criteria, a median response duration of 20
months, a median survival of 22 months, and a 6week mortality rate of 3%.19,20 Compared with historic experience with intensive chemotherapy in
patients with higher risk MDS, decitabine was associated with a signiﬁcantly better survival (P < .001),
and those results were conﬁrmed by multivariate
analysis. In a study from Europe by Lubbert et al., 51
elderly patients (median age, 72 years; range, 63–85
years) with AML who were deemed unﬁt for intensive chemotherapy received decitabine 135 mg/m2
by continuous infusion over 3 days every 6 weeks.
Overall, 31% of patients achieved a CR (n ¼ 4
patients) or a partial response (n ¼ 5 patients), and
an additional 31% of patients had hematologic
improvement for an overall response rate of 62%.21
An ongoing study in elderly patients with AML who
were deemed unﬁt for intensive chemotherapy is
comparing intravenous (IV) decitabine 20 mg/m2
daily 5 with subcutaneous cytarabine 20 mg/m2
daily 14. Silverman et al. reviewed their experience
with 5-azacitidine in patients who were treated for
MDS but who were reclassiﬁed with AML based on
the presence of 20% blasts. Among 103 patients
who were treated, 35% to 48% achieved at least a hematologic improvement (CR rate, 9%). The median
survival of 27 patients who were randomized to
receive azacitidine on the Phase III trials was 19.3
months compared with 12.9 months in 25 patients
who were assigned to observation.22
Cloretazine is an alkylating, DNA-intercalating
agent that has demonstrated anti-AML activity. This
led to a Phase II study of cloretazine 600 mg/m2 IV
1 for remission induction in elderly patients with
AML. One hundred seven patients were treated.
Overall, 29 patients (27%) achieved CR, and
5 patients (5%) had a CRp for an overall response
rate of 32%. The induction mortality rate was 18%.
Forty-seven of the 109 patients had no prior MDS
and no other prior malignancies. Among them, 20
patients achieved a CR, and 2 patients had a CRp for
an overall response rate of 47%. The estimated 1year survival rate in this subset was 30%. A conﬁrmatory trial is ongoing in this subset of patients.23
The combination of low-dose cytarabine with arsenic trioxide also appears to be promising. Roboz24
treated 101 elderly patients (aged 60 years; median
age, 74 years) with AML (n ¼ 64 patients) or MDS
(n ¼ 37 patients) with cytarabine 5 to 10 mg/m2 subcu-

taneously twice daily for 14 days and arsenic trioxide
0.25 mg/kg IV daily for 10 days (Days 1 through 5 and
Days 8 through 12). In the AML group, 21 of 64 patients
(34%) achieved a CR, and the median response duration
was 7 months. In the MDS group, 5 of 37 patients
(18%) achieved a CR, and the median response duration
was 6 months. A randomized trial of low-dose cytarabine with or without arsenic trioxide is under consideration (unpublished results).24
In summary, several encouraging therapeutic
leads have emerged that hold promise for the treatment of elderly patients with AML who are deemed
unﬁt to receive intensive chemotherapy. Hopefully,
some of them will be successful enough to become
part of the new treatment armamentarium for elderly patients with AML.
