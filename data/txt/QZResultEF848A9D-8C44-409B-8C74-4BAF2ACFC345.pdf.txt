Abstract
Although hyperthermia offers clinical appeal to sensitize cells
to chemotherapy, this approach has been limited in terms of longterm outcome as well as economic and technical burden. Thus, a
more detailed knowledge about how hyperthermia exerts its
effects on chemotherapy may illuminate ways to improve the
approach. Here, we asked whether hyperthermia alters the
response to chemotherapy-induced DNA damage and whether
this mechanism is involved in its sensitizing effect in BRCAcompetent models of ovarian and colon cancer. Notably, we
found that hyperthermia delayed the repair of DNA damage
caused by cisplatin or doxorubicin, acting upstream of different
repair pathways to block histone polyADP-ribosylation (PARyla-

tion), a known effect of chemotherapy. Furthermore, hyperthermia blocked this histone modiﬁcation as efﬁciently as pharmacologic inhibitors of PARP (PARPi), producing comparable
delay in DNA repair, induction of double-strand breaks (DSB),
and cell cytotoxicity after chemotherapy. Mechanistic investigations indicated that inhibiting PARylation by either hyperthermia
or PARPi induced lethal DSB upon chemotherapy treatment
not only by reducing DNA repair but also by preventing replication fork slowing. Overall, our work reveals how PARP blockade,
either by hyperthermia or small-molecule inhibition, can increase chemotherapy-induced damage in BRCA-competent cells.

Introduction

repair in heterochromatic DNA is chromatin relaxation rendering
DNA lesions accessible to repair proteins. This is predominantly
facilitated through PARP1-mediated polyADP-ribosylation (PARylation) making PARP1 an essential player in different repair
pathways, such as base excision repair (BER; ref. 6), nucleotide
excision repair (7), homologous recombination (HR; ref. 8), and
nonhomologous end joining (9). We, here, report that hyperthermia inhibits chemotherapy-induced PARylation as efﬁciently
as pharmacologic PARP inhibitors (PARPi). Importantly, both
hyperthermia and PARPi potentiate chemotherapy by reducing
DNA repair and preventing replication fork slowing, leading to
elevated double-strand break (DSB) formation and eventually
reduced long-term survival.

It has been demonstrated that hyperthermia augments
the efﬁcacy of DNA-damaging agents both in preclinical studies
(1, 2) as well as in clinical trials of hyperthermic intraperitoneal
chemotherapy (HIPEC) in peritoneal carcinosis patients (2, 3),
indicating that one mechanism of the sensitizing effect of elevated
temperature is induction of DNA repair dysfunctionality. Indeed,
direct interactions between hyperthermia and repair of g irradiation–induced DNA damage have been reported (4). Importantly, enhanced temperatures sensitize to different cytotoxic drugs,
such as platinum compounds (1), doxorubicin (2), and mitomycin-C (5), inducing different types of DNA damage and consequently activating different repair pathways. This indicates that
hyperthermia might affect common enzymatic reactions shared
by different DNA repair pathways. One prerequisite for DNA

Material and Methods
Cell lines and patient tumors
OVCAR8 and OVCAR3 were purchased from the NCI (Rockville, MD). HCT116 and LOVO are from ATCC. All four cell lines
were authenticated by STR proﬁle analysis (PowerPlex 21HS,
Promega), with frozen aliquots from same passages used for
experiments. Tumor tissues were obtained from 15 peritoneal
carcinosis patients (9 from ovary and 6 from colon) directly after
cytoreductive surgery (CRS). All patients underwent CRS and
HIPEC in our hospital. The investigation was approved by the
local ethics committee (159/2011BO2), and informed consent
was obtained from the patients. Culture was performed as
described previously (Supplementary Material; ref. 10).
Immunoﬂuorescent staining
Staining procedure and foci scoring was performed according
to standard protocols (described in Supplementary Material) with

Hyperthermia potentiates chemotherapy by blocking PARylation. OVCAR8 and HCT116 were cultivated at 37 C and 3% oxygen. Treatment was performed at
either 37 C or 42 C under atmospheric oxygen. Cisplatin was used at 40 mmol/L at both temperatures, as we found no differences in quantity of PtDNA adducts at
37 C or 42 C (Supplementary Fig. S1). Doxorubicin dosages had to be adapted to reach similar intracellular concentrations at both temperatures: 15 mmol/L
at 37 C and 6.5 mmol/L or 7.0 mmol/L at 42 C for HCT116 or OVCAR8, respectively (Supplementary Fig. S1). PARP inhibitors were added 2 hours before

Results and Discussion
Hyperthermia blocks chemotherapy-induced PARylation as
efﬁciently as pharmacologic PARPi
Previously, it has been demonstrated that hyperthermia inhibits HR by BRCA2 degradation, leading to an enhanced sensitivity to PARPi (4). We here addressed the question if hyperthermia may also act upstream of DNA repair processes by direct
alteration of chemotherapy-induced PARP activity. For this, we
incubated BRCA-competent, HR-proﬁcient cells [demonstrated
by their expression of BRCA proteins and their ability to form
Rad51 foci (Supplementary Fig. S1; ref. 13)] derived from colon
and ovarian cancer with or without adapted cisplatin or doxorubicin concentrations at 37 C or 42 C (Supplementary Fig. S2)
and subsequently analyzed global PARylation. Treatment was
performed for one hour to mimic the clinical HIPEC setting. As
shown in Fig. 1, hyperthermia completely blocked cisplatinand doxorubicin-mediated PARylation. The efﬁcacy of this
blockade was comparable with that observed after pharmacologic inhibition of PARP with three different PARPi (Fig. 1A and
B). Besides the pan-PARPi PJ34, we selected a speciﬁc PARP1/2
inhibitor (A966492) and rucaparib currently used in phase II
trials of patients with peritoneal carcinosis (14). Importantly,
the synergistic effect of hyperthermia and cisplatin or doxorubicin on long-term survival was comparable with that observed
after concomitant use of PARPi and cisplatin or doxorubicin
(Fig. 1C). These data indicate that inhibition of PARP enzymatic
activity is critical for the potentiating effect. This is supported by
the ﬁnding that hyperthermia or PARPi failed to increase cytotoxic effects of compounds not inducing acute PARylation, such
as paclitaxel or 5FU (Supplementary Fig. S3A). It is unlikely that
hyperthermia leads to the degradation of PARP1 or induction of
PARG, as protein levels were unchanged in OVCAR8 and only
minimally regulated in HCT116 (Supplementary Fig. S3B).
Interestingly, Petesch and Lis recently showed an even enhanced
PARylation upon hyperthermia at a speciﬁc site of the Hsp70
promoter (15). Our experiments reveal an almost complete
hyperthermia-mediated inhibition of global PARylation upon
DNA damage. Together, these data indicate a differential impact
of elevated temperature on PARP, namely an enhanced activation as cotranscription factor and a concomitant reduced function as repair protein.
Hyperthermia or PARPi signiﬁcantly delays repair of cisplatin
and doxorubicin-induced DNA damages
We next asked whether hyperthermia may inﬂuence the
efﬁcacy of Pt-DNA adduct removal upon cisplatin as well as
DNA strand break repair upon doxorubicin treatment. We
therefore performed time course experiments following
short-term incubation of cells with or without chemotherapy

at different temperatures. Both cisplatin adducts and doxorubicin-induced strand breaks were efﬁciently repaired within
the ﬁrst 6 hours at 37 C. In contrast, at 42 C, we observed a
signiﬁcant slowdown of Pt-DNA adduct removal (Fig. 2A) and
an almost complete blockade of strand break repair upon
doxorubicin treatment (Fig. 2B and Supplementary Fig. S4).
Importantly, similar effects were observed after pharmacologic
inhibition of PARP1/2 (Fig. 2). These ﬁndings are corroborated
by previous data from lung cancer (16), indicating that PARP is
not only implicated in BER and DNA stand break repair but
also in Pt-DNA adduct removal.
Hyperthermia or PARPi enhances cisplatin and doxorubicininduced DSB formation in replicating cells
Deﬁcient repair of DNA alterations leads to secondary DNA
DSB (17). Our data demonstrate that the combination of cisplatin
or doxorubicin with hyperthermia induced signiﬁcantly higher
numbers of gH2AX/P-53BP1 foci per cell as compared with
cisplatin or doxorubicin alone. Again, the same degree of foci
formation was seen after combined treatment of cisplatin or
doxorubicin with different PARPi (Fig. 3A). To prove whether
the same mechanisms pertain in the complexity of a primary
tumor, precision-cut tumor tissue slices from patients with peritoneal carcinosis were treated and stained for gH2AX/P-53BP1. As
shown in Fig. 3B, again, signiﬁcantly increased DSBs were detected
upon combination with hyperthermia or PARP inhibition. Of
note, all samples were positive for BRCA1 and BRCA2, and we
detected geminin-positive cancer cells with Rad51 foci, indicative
for HR competence (13) in 14 of 15 investigated tumors (Supplementary Fig. S5).
Whereas g irradiation led to foci formation in 100% of the cells
(Supplementary Fig. S6), chemotherapy-induced DSBs were
restricted to a subset of cells both with and without hyperthermia
or PARPi. We hypothesized that this effect may depend on
cell-cycle status and performed costaining with geminin, detecting
S–G2-phase cells. As shown in Fig. 3C, gH2AX foci formation
upon treatment with cisplatin and hyperthermia or PARPi was
restricted to geminin-positive cells, indicating that PARP inhibition via hyperthermia or pharmacologic intervention increases
DSB only during S–G2-phase.
Hyperthermia or PARPi prevents DNA damage–induced
replication fork slowing upon cisplatin or doxorubicin
Our ﬁnding that synergistic effects of hyperthermia or PARPi
with doxorubicin and cisplatin on DSB formation are only
observed in S–G2-phase prompted us to investigate possible
inﬂuences of this combinatory treatment on replication. Therefore, we performed DNA ﬁber spreading analyses (Fig. 4).
Cisplatin and doxorubicin led to an immediate slowdown of
replication fork progression, as demonstrated by reduced CldU
tract length distribution (Fig. 4B). Similar effects were observed
in primary tumor cells isolated from peritoneal carcinosis (Fig.
4C). The effect was accompanied by an almost complete stop of
new origin ﬁring as indicated by an accumulation of IdUrdonly paralleled by a loss of CldU-only ﬁbers in cell lines and
primary cancer cells (Fig. 4B and C). Hyperthermia or PARPi
alone had no effect on replication fork progression (Fig. 4).
Importantly, however, hyperthermia as well as pharmacologic
inhibition of PARP1/2 completely abolished chemotherapyinduced fork slowing in cell lines and primary cancer cells. The

2874 Cancer Res; 76(10) May 15, 2016

inability of replication fork arrest upon chemotherapy in cells
with blocked PARP1/2 activity is conﬁrmed by new origin ﬁring
and reduced replication stops (Fig. 4). Of note, the degree of
fork slowing upon cisplatin or doxorubicin alone and its
blockade after coincubation with hyperthermia or PARPi
observed in our study is similar to the data published by Berti
and colleagues, who investigated effects of camptothecin
together with PARPi (12). They demonstrated a central role of
PARylation in replication fork regression upon camptothecin
through inhibition of the helicase RECQ1. Inhibition of
PARP1/2 restored RECQ1 activity, leading to a deregulated
untimely restart of reversed forks and eventually to DSB formation (12). Importantly, replication fork reversal seems not to
be restricted to torsional DNA stress upon TopI inhibition but
is also present in cells with unrepaired interstrand cross-links
produced, for instance, by platinum compounds (18). Interestingly, anthracyclines, like doxorubicin, also produce interstrand adducts (19), which are claimed to be predominantly
involved in cell death upon doxorubicin (20).
Taken together, we demonstrate that hyperthermia acts
via abolishing DNA damage–induced PARylation, leading to
the inhibition of DNA repair and prevention of replication
fork slowing. Probably together with the previously described effect on HR proﬁciency (4), this results in elevated
DSB formation and eventually reduced long-term survival.
The ﬁndings that elevated temperature neither inﬂuenced the
induction of acute apoptosis (Supplementary Fig. S7A) nor
regulation of bona ﬁde apoptosis genes (Supplementary
Fig. S7B and S7C; Supplementary Table) and that simultaneous treatment of cells with hyperthermia and PARPi only
marginally enhanced the potentiating effect of hyperthermia
or PARPi alone (Supplementary Fig. S8) indicate that the
synergistic effect produced by hyperthermia acts predominantly through the inhibition of global PARylation and subsequent deregulation of DNA repair and replication fork progression upon chemotherapy. The ﬁnding that comparable
effects were observed upon pharmacologic PARP inhibition
at normothermic conditions implies that the combination
of PARPi with replication stress–inducing drugs provides an
attractive alternative to HIPEC.
Our work not only unravels a major molecular mechanism for
hyperthermia-related chemotherapy-induced DNA damage
response but might have important future clinical implications:
(i) agents to be combined with hyperthermia can be selected more
speciﬁcally, that is, particularly drugs with a high potential for
inducing PARylation; and (ii) repeated normothermic chemotherapy perfusion simultaneously with the application of a systemic PARPi might overcome severe adverse side-effects of hyperthermia by HIPEC procedures. In addition, sufﬁcient killing of
proliferating cells due to the timely limited nature of hyperthermia will be counteracted.
Another important novel aspect of our work implicates that
PARPi might have signiﬁcant effects not only in BRCA-deﬁcient
but also in BRCA-competent cells when combined with replication stress–inducing chemotherapeutics. This might open an
avenue of effective pharmacologic treatment of patients with
peritoneal carcinosis.
