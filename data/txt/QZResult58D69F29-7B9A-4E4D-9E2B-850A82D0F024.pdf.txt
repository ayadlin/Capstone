SUMMARY
Bcl-2 can be converted into a pro-apoptotic molecule by nuclear receptor Nur77. However, the
development of Bcl-2 converters as anti-cancer therapeutics has not been explored. Here we report
the identification of a Nur77-derived Bcl-2 converting peptide with 9 amino acids (NuBCP-9) and
its enantiomer, which induce apoptosis of cancer cells in vitro and in animals. The apoptotic effect
of NuBCPs and their activation of Bax are not inhibited but rather potentiated by Bcl-2. NuBCP-9
enantiomers bind to the Bcl-2 loop, which shares the characteristics of structurally adaptable regions
with many cancer-associated and signaling proteins. NuBCP-9s act as molecular switches to dislodge
the Bcl-2 BH4 domain, exposing its BH3 domain, which in turn blocks the activity of anti-apoptotic
Bcl-XL.

SIGNIFICANCE
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We report that a Nur77-based peptide and its enantiomer bind the Bcl-2 loop, converting Bcl-2
from a protector to a killer of cancer cells. Our results provide mechanistic insight into Bcl-2
conversion and identify a new direction for Bcl-2-based drug leads and cancer drug
development. These findings should appeal to a broad audience of clinicians, cancer biologists,
molecular biologists and drug designers who have followed the therapeutic approaches
targeting Bcl-2 and the underlying molecular mechanisms. In addition, peptide and protein
chemists and structural biologists will be intrigued by the activity of an enantiomer, which has
important mechanistic implications with broad potential for cancer therapeutics.

INTRODUCTION
NIH-PA Author Manuscript
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Members of the Bcl-2 family are critical regulators of apoptosis, an important biological
process that eliminates cells with increased malignant potential such as those with damaged
DNA or aberrant cell cycling (Cory et al., 2003; Green and Kroemer, 2004; Reed, 1998; Vander
Heiden and Thompson, 1999). They possess at least one of the four conserved motifs called
Bcl-2 homology (BH) domains. The family is divided into three subclasses based on numbers
of BH domains and function: the anti-apoptotics, including Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL, possess sequence
conservation through BH1-4, and pro-apoptotics, which are further divided into multidomain
members such as Bax and Bak possessing BH1-3, and BH3-only molecules such as Bid, Bim
and Bad (Cory et al., 2003; Green and Kroemer, 2004; Reed, 1998; Vander Heiden and
Thompson, 1999). They regulate apoptosis through interactions between the pro-apoptotic and
antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family members. BH3-only proteins convey diverse death signals by
directly or indirectly activating Bax and/or Bak, which can induce permeabilization of the outer
mitochondrial membrane and release apoptogenic factors needed to activate the caspases
(Kuwana et al., 2005; Leber et al., 2007; Letai et al., 2002; Willis and Adams, 2005). Antiapoptotic family members inhibit death by restraining Bax and Bak activity and/or by
sequestering BH3-only members. Recently, approaches targeting pro-survival Bcl-2 family
members, such as BH3 domain-derived peptides or chemical inhibitors such as ABT-737
(Bouillet and Strasser, 2002; Degterev et al., 2001; Oltersdorf et al., 2005; Reed, 2002;
Walensky et al., 2004), are being developed, which show significant anti-cancer activities.
These BH3 peptides and chemical inhibitors act by binding to the hydrophobic groove formed
by the BH1-3 domains of the pro-survival proteins and antagonizing their survival function,
resulting in release of pro-apoptotic members that activate apoptosis.

The functional phenotype of some Bcl-2 family members such as Bcl-2 can be reversed in
some cellular contexts. For example, mutants of the Bcl-2-homolog, Ced-9, appear to promote
rather than prevent apoptosis in C. elegans (Xue and Horvitz, 1997). Likewise, Bcl-2 homologs
in Drosophila can manifest either cytoprotective or cytodestructive phenotypes, depending on
cellular context (Colussi et al., 2000; Igaki et al., 2000). The mechanisms responsible for the
phenotypic conversion of Bcl-2 are largely undefined. However, the unstructured loop of Bcl-2,
which links the BH3 and BH4 domains, appears important (Moll et al., 2006; Zhang, 2007).
When the Bcl-2 loop is cleaved by caspase-3, Bcl-2 is converted to a pro-apoptotic protein
similar to Bax (Cheng et al., 1997; Grandgirard et al., 1998). Phosphorylation of the loop has
also been speculated to convert Bcl-2 to a pro-apoptotic form (Blagosklonny, 2001). It inhibits
binding of Bcl-2 to multidomain and BH3-only pro-apoptotic family members (Bassik et al.,
2004), and autophagic protein Beclin 1 (Wei et al., 2008). We recently reported that nuclear
receptor Nur77 converts Bcl-2 into a killer by binding its loop (Lin et al., 2004). Nur77 (also
called TR3 or NGFI-B) is a potent pro-apoptotic member of the nuclear receptor superfamily
(Moll et al., 2006; Zhang, 2007). It often translocates from the nucleus to mitochondria in
response to different death signals, where it binds Bcl-2 inducing a conformational change
(Li et al., 2000; Lin et al., 2004). Nur77 translocation to mitochondria and its induction of a
Bcl-2 conformational change has also been implicated in the negative selection of thymocytes
in vitro and in animals (Thompson and Winoto, 2008), indicating a physiological role for the
Nur77-Bcl-2 interaction. Interestingly, p53 also binds the Bcl-2 loop (Moll et al., 2006) which
then acts like a BH3-only protein to activate Bax or Bak by releasing BH3-only proteins like
Bid (Chipuk et al., 2005; Leu et al., 2004; Mihara et al., 2003).
The apoptotic effect of Nur77 appears to be clinically relevant, as the expression of the Nur77
subfamily member Nor-1 is positively correlated with survival of diffuse large B-cell
lymphoma patients (Shipp et al., 2002) and Nur77 downregulation is associated with metastasis
of several primary solid tumors (Ramaswamy et al., 2003). Thus, targeting the Nur77-Bcl-2
apoptotic pathway is an attractive approach for developing cancer therapeutics. The ability of

Nur77 to convert Bcl-2 distinguishes this death protein from pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family
proteins, whose activities are restrained by pro-survival Bcl-2 family members. It also offers
an opportunity to design drugs, which are likely to be effective against cancer cells with high
Bcl-2 levels. Here, we report the identification of a short Nur77-derived peptide and its
enantiomer that act as molecular switches to induce a Bcl-2 conformational change, converting
it from a protector to a killer of cancer cells in vitro and in animals.

RESULTS
A 9-amino acid peptide from Nur77 (NuBCP-9) induces apoptosis

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To develop Bcl-2 converters that induce apoptosis in cancer cells with high Bcl-2 levels,
peptides corresponding to subregions of a Nur77 fragment, known to interact with Bcl-2 (Lin
et al., 2004), were synthesized and conjugated with the cell-penetrating-peptide (CPP), D-Arg
octamer (r8) (Jones et al., 2005) (Figure 1A). Amongst these, a 20 amino acid peptide (aa 480
to 499) (NuBCP-20) exhibited potent apoptotic effect in various cancer cell lines, being more
potent than a BH3 peptide derived from the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member Bid (Letai et
al., 2002) (Figures S1 and S2). Serial deletion identified a 9-mer Nur77 peptide, NuBCP-9,
which effectively induced apoptosis of breast cancer cells (Figure 1B and Figure S2). Neither
NuBCP-20 nor NuBCP-9 induced the apoptosis of normal primary mammary epithelial cells
(Figure 1B and Figure S1). NuBCP-9 is considerably shorter than the shortest BH3 peptide
that binds Bcl-2. Further deletion from either its N-terminal or C-terminal end or substituting
Ala for NuBCP-9 terminal amino acids (NuBCP-9/AA) completely abolished its apoptotic
effect (Figure S2). NuBCP-9 linked to other CPPs, penetratin or transportan-10 (Jones et al.,
2005) as well as r8 by a disulfide bond showed a similar degree of apoptosis (Figure S2). Since
disulfide bonds are rapidly reduced in cells, the apoptotic effect of NuBCP-9 is not due to its
linkage with CPPs.
While investigating the sequence requirements for NuBCP-9, we discovered that replacing Lamino acids with D-amino acids did not diminish its death effect. Peptide enantiomers have
been reported to interact with several proteins (Zhou et al., 2002), including calmodulin,
α3β1 integrin, DnaJ (Hsp40) co-chaperone and CXCR4, which like Bcl-2 are characterized by
large natively disordered loops. In contrast, the enantiomer of Bad-BH3 peptide was not
apoptotic (Figure 1C), demonstrating different mode of action of the NuBCP-9 and Bad-BH3
peptides.
Induction of apoptosis by NuBCP-9 is Bcl-2 dependent

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We next examined whether NuBCP-9-induced apoptosis was dependent on Bcl-2 expression.
NuBCP-9 and its enantiomer showed little effect on Jurkat cells (<20% apoptosis). However,
both peptides induced extensive apoptosis (>50%) in Jurkat cells stably expressing Bcl-2
(Figure 1D). In contrast, apoptosis induced by staurosporine (STS) and Bid BH3 peptide was
attenuated by Bcl-2 overexpression in Jurkat cells (Figure S3), demonstrating the dual role of
Bcl-2. Stable expression of Bcl-2 in CEM leukemia cells also potentiated the death effect of
Nur77 peptide but prevented the killing by STS and Bad BH3 peptide (Figure S4). The
apoptotic effect of NuBCP-9 was further evaluated in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs)
and Bcl-2 knockout MEFs (Bcl-2−/−MEFs). Although the death effect of STS and Bad BH3
peptide was enhanced in Bcl-2−/−MEFs (Figure 1E), NuBCP-9 and D-NuBCP-9 induced
apoptosis of MEFs but not Bcl-2−/−MEFs in a dose (Figure 1F) and time (Figure 1G) dependent
manner. Further, suppression of Bcl-2 expression by siRNA or antisense oligonucleotides
reduced the killing effect of NuBCP-9 enantiomers (Figures S5–S6). Thus, Bcl-2 is a major
target of NuBCP-9s. NuBCP-induced apoptosis requires Bax or Bak, as the peptides similarly
induced apoptosis of wild-type, Bax−/−, and Bak−/− MEFs, but lacked activity in double

knockout Bax−/−Bak−/−MEFs (Figure 1H), further demonstrating that the peptides act via the
Bcl-2-regulated pathway.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The effects of Nur77 peptides on clonogenic survival of MEFs were determined. After exposure
to NuBCP-9 or D-NuBCP-9 peptide, MEFs formed very few colonies compared to
Bcl-2−/−MEFs (Figure 2A). For example, MEFs treated with 10 µM D-NuBCP-9 formed only
5% of the colonies compared to Bcl-2−/−MEFs. The suppressive effect of NuBCP-9 (Figure
2B) or D-NuBCP-9 (Figure 2C) was also largely reduced in Bax−/−Bak−/−MEFs. Treatment
with 15 µM D-NuBCP-9 resulted in about 80% reduction of colonies in MEFs but did not
decrease the number of colonies formed by Bax−/−Bak−/− MEFs (Figure 2C). To further
evaluate NuBCPs, their effects on the growth of tumors formed in SCID mice were examined.
Injection of L- or D-NuBCP-9 but not control peptide (NuBCP-9/AA) dramatically suppressed
the growth of MDA-MB435 cancer cell xenografts in mice (Figure 2D and Figure S2C), and
potently induced apoptosis of tumor cells, revealed by TUNEL staining (Figures 2E–F).
Furthermore, D-NuBCP-9 induced the regression of tumors (Figure 2G). Thus NuBCP-9 and
its enantiomer effectively induce apoptosis in vitro and in animals, demonstrating their
therapeutic potential.
NuBCP-9 and its enantiomer bind Bcl-2

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To determine whether NuBCPs bind Bcl-2, cDNA encoding the residues 478–504
(Nur77/478-504) and 489–497 (Nur77/489-497, equivalent to NuBCP-9) of Nur77 were fused
with cDNA of green fluorescence protein (GFP). When transfected into HEK293T cells, GFPfused Nur77 fragments were precipitated by anti-Bcl-2 antibody only when Bcl-2 was coexpressed (Figure 3A). The co-precipitation was inhibited by addition of NuBCP-9, but not
Smac-peptide (not shown). To study whether D-NuBCP-9 interacted with Bcl-2, we used a
competition assay. Nur77 lacking its DNA-binding-domain (DBD), Nur77/ΔDBD, bound
Bcl-2 (Lin et al., 2004), and binding was inhibited by NuBCP-9 or D-NuBCP-9 (Figure 3B).
GFP-Nur77/478-504 also bound to anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members, Bcl-B and Bfl-1, but
not Bcl-XL and Mcl-1 (Figure 3C). Like Nur77 protein (Luciano et al., 2007), the killing effect
of NuBCP-9 was enhanced by overexpression of Bcl-B in HeLa cells and inhibited by
suppression of Bcl-B expression by siRNA in H460 cells (Figure S6). These results suggest
that NuBCP-9 also converts Bcl-B into a pro-apoptotic molecule.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We next used fluorescence polarization (FP) assays to determine whether NuBCP-9s bind
Bcl-2. GST-Bcl-2, but neither GST-Bcl-XL nor GST, induced a concentration-dependent FP
of FITC-NuBCP-9 and FITC-D-NuBCP-9, while the FP of FITC-NuBCP-9/AA was little
affected (Figure 3D). In addition, unconjugated NuBCP-9 and D-NuBCP-9 competed with
binding of FITC-L-NuBCP-9 or FITC-D-NuBCP-9 to GST-Bcl-2, whereas NuBCP-9/AA did
not (Figure 3E). Thus, NuBCP-9 and D-NuBCP-9 bind Bcl-2 directly and competitively. The
Bcl-2 domain targeted by NuBCPs is distinct from that targeted by BH3 peptides, as shown
by the failure of either a BH3 peptide (Bak BH3) or a potent small molecule inhibitor
(ABT-737) that targets the Bcl-2 BH3- binding site to reduce FITC-NuBCP-9 binding to GSTBcl-2 (Figure 3E).
The GFP-Nur77/489-497 and GFP-Nur77/478-504 fusions co-localized extensively with RFPMito, a red fluorescence protein (RFP) fused to a mitochondria-targeting sequence (Figure 3F).
FITC-D-NuBCP-9-r8 also displayed significant co-localization with RFP-Mito. Thus,
NuBCP-9 and its enantiomer, as Nur77, bind Bcl-2 and target mitochondria.
NuBCP-9s induce Bcl-2 conformational change
Conversion of Bcl-2 involves a conformational change that exposes its BH3 domain (Lin et
al., 2004). BH3 domain exposure is detectable with antibody against a Bcl-2 BH3 peptide

(Figure S7). The effect of NuBCPs on Bcl-2 conformation was examined by
immunoprecipitation assays (Figure 4A). The Bcl-2 BH3 domain antibody precipitated
endogenous Bcl-2 in cells treated with NuBCP-9 or D-NuBCP-9, but not NuBCP-9/AA,
showing that NuBCP-9s induced a Bcl-2 conformational change. In contrast, tBid-BH3 and
Bad-BH3 peptides did not induce this effect, despite their induction of apoptosis. This was
confirmed by flow cytometry analysis, showing a strong enhancement in fluorescence upon
staining cells with BH3 antibody exposed to NuBCP-9s, but not NuBCP-9/AA, tBid-BH3, or
Smac peptide (Figure 4B). NuBCP-9-induced Bcl-2 BH3 domain immunofluorescence was
observed in the presence of the caspase inhibitor zVAD, excluding the involvement of caspases
in the Bcl-2 conformational change (Figure S7D). The NuBCP-induced Bcl-2 conformational
change was also observed in solid tumors (Figure 2F). The overlapping of TUNEL staining
with Bcl-2 BH3 immunofluorescence in tumor treated with NuBCP-9 (Figure 2F) is consistent
with the notion that NuBCP-9-induced Bcl-2-dependent apoptosis is correlated with the
exposure of Bcl-2 BH3 domain.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We next determined whether NuBCPs could induce a conformational change of purified GSTBcl-2 protein using circular dichroism (CD) analysis. Our results showed similar changes in
GST-Bcl-2 protein spectra, when it was incubated with NuBCP-9 or D-NuBCP-9, but not
NuBCP-9/AA (Figure 4C). The fact that NuBCP-9 and D-NuBCP-9, display mirror image
spectra (Figures S8–S10), while inducing identical changes in the Bcl-2 spectra (Figure 4C
and Figure S8), indicates that NuBCP-9 and D-NuBCP-9 do not contribute significantly to the
spectral changes. Binding is saturable and stoichiometric with a Kd of 2.1 ± 0.2 µM for
NuBCP-9 and 2.0 ± 0.1 µM for D-NuBCP-9 (Figures 4D–E), in agreement with FP assays
(Figure 3E). In contrast, NuBCP-9, D-NuBCP-9 and NuBCP-9/AA had no effect on CD spectra
for GST or GST-Bcl-XL (Figures S9–S10). Thus, the NuBCP-induced Bcl-2 conformational
change observed in cells can be accounted for by direct binding of NuBCPs to Bcl-2 in a specific
1:1 complex.
NuBCP-9s are capable of binding to the loop of Bcl-2

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The observations that NuBCP-9 and its enantiomer exhibited similar if not identical effects on
Bcl-2 function raised the possibility that their binding interface(s) are structurally adaptive.
The large, regulatory loop of Bcl-2 is predicted to be natively unstructured (Figure S11) and
like other loops of this class may be structurally adaptive (Dyson and Wright, 2005; Iakoucheva
et al., 2002). Cell-based Co-IP (Figure 5A) showed that Bcl-2 N-terminal fragment containing
the BH4 domain and loop, Bcl-2/1-90, interacted with Nur77 mutants (Nur77/DC3, Nur77/
DC1, and Nur77/478-504) known to bind Bcl-2. In vitro, NuBCP-9 and its enantiomer bound
similarly and competitively to GST-Bcl-2/1-90, revealed by FP assays (Figure 5B). CD
analysis showed that both NuBCP-9s induced similar changes in GST-Bcl-2/1-90 spectra
(Figure 5C and Figure S12). The binding affinities of NuBCP-9s for Bcl-2/1-90 (Kd=1.7 µM
for NuBCP-9; Kd=2.5 µM for D-NuBCP-9) (Figure 4E and Figure 5B) are similar to the
affinities for Bcl-2 (Figure 4E), as are the stoichiometries (Figure 4D, 4E and Figure 5D). Thus,
Bcl-2/1-90 retained the ability of Bcl-2 to bind to NuBCP-9s, excluding the involvement of
the hydrophobic groove in Bcl-2, consistent with the inability of BH3 peptide and ABT-737
to compete with the binding of NuBCP-9 to Bcl-2 (Figure 3E). We next examined whether the
Bcl-2 loop alone was capable of binding to NuBCP-9s. The Myc-tagged Bcl-2 loop, MycBcl-2/29-90, interacted with GFP-Nur77/DC3 (Figure 5E). The interaction was inhibited by
NuBCP-9 or D-NuBCP-9, but not by NuBCP-9/AA (Figure 5F). Mutations of Thr69 and Ser70
in the loop slightly enhanced its interaction with Nur77/DC3, while insertion of 10 amino acids
in the loop largely impaired the interaction (Figure 5G). Strong support was provided by FP
assays, showing that both peptides bound to GST-Bcl-2/29-90 protein (Figure 5H). Also,
NuBCP-9 and its enantiomer but not the mutant peptide competed with FITC-NuBCP-9 for
binding to GST-Bcl-2/29-90. Further, CD analysis showed a similar change of the spectra of

GST-Bcl-2/29-90 protein by NuBCP-9 and its enantiomer (Figure 5I and Figure S13). Bcl-2
and Bcl-2/1-90 underwent greater NuBCP-induced changes in their CD spectra than
Bcl-2/29-90, suggesting involvement of the BH4 domain. Thus, NuBCP-9 and its enantiomer
bind the Bcl-2 loop.
NuBCP-9 induces Bcl-2-dependent Bax activation

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Our observation that NuBCP-9-induced apoptosis was dependent on Bax and/or Bak prompted
us to investigate whether and how NuBCP-9 activated Bax. In vitro assays using isolated
mitochondria showed that both NuBCP-9 and D-NuBCP-9 induced Bax dimerization,
trimerization and especially oligomerization (Figure 6A) in a concentration dependent manner
(Figure 6B). Such an effect occurred only in the presence of GST-Bcl-2 protein. In DoHH2
lymphoma cells that express high levels of Bcl-2 (Dyer et al., 1996), NuBCP-9 induced Bax
dimerization/oligomerization (Figure 6C). Transfection of Bcl-2/1-95 inhibited both
NuBCP-9-induced apoptosis (Figure 6D) and Bax activation (Figure 6E). NuBCP-9 also
induced Bax activation in H460 cells revealed by flow cytometric analysis of Bax
immunostaining with anti-Bax antibody (6A7) that recognizes active Bax conformation
(Nechushtan et al., 1999) (Figure 6F). Similar to its effect in DoHH2 cells, Bcl-2/1-95 potently
inhibited NuBCP-9-induced apoptosis (Figure 6G) and Bax activation in H460 cells (Figure
6H). Furthermore, expression of Bcl-2/ΔBH3, Bcl-2 mutant lacking its BH3 domain, inhibited
NuBCP-9-induced apoptosis (Figure 6G) and Bax activation (Figure 6H). In MEF cells,
NuBCP-9-induced Bax activation was observed in the wild-type but not Bcl-2 knockout cells
(Figure 6I). However, transfection of Bcl-2 into Bcl-2−/−MEF restored the ability of NuBCP
to activate Bax (Figure 6J). Together, these cell-free and cell-based studies demonstrate that
NuBCP-9 induces Bax activation in a Bcl-2 dependent manner and that the loop and BH3
regions of Bcl-2 are crucial.
NuBCP-9s disrupt Bcl-2 intra-molecular interaction

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To study the mechanism by which enantiomeric NuBCPs induced Bcl-2 conformational
change, we first examined how the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 conformation was maintained and
found that the Bcl-2 BH4 domain could act like a brace to stabilize the C-terminal anti-apoptotic
BH3-binding pocket. Co-IP revealed that a Bcl-2 N-terminal sequence containing the BH4
domain bound a Bcl-2 mutant from which the BH4 domain was removed (Bcl-2/ΔBH4) (Figure
7A), suggesting an intra-molecular interaction between the BH4 domain and the C-terminal
region. The BH4 domain could not bind full-length Bcl-2, likely due to inaccessibility of a
BH4-binding site in the C-terminal region. However, a strong interaction was observed when
Nur77/ΔDBD or Nur77/DC3 was coexpressed (Figure 7B), suggesting that binding of Nur77
mutants with Bcl-2 reorganized Bcl-2, leading to the exposure of the BH4-binding site in the
C-terminal region. Similarly, addition of NuBCP-9 and its enantiomer induced the binding of
BH4 domain to Bcl-2 (Figure 7C). Removal of the BH4 domain through caspase cleavage of
Bcl-2 loop converts it into a death molecule (Cheng et al., 1997; Grandgirard et al., 1998).
Consistently, a Bcl-2 mutant lacking its BH4 domain was extensively immunostained by antiBcl-2/BH3 antibody, while the wild-type Bcl-2 protein was not, indicating that the exposure
of the BH3 epitope was blocked directly or indirectly by the BH4 domain (Figure 7D). Thus,
our data unravel a mechanism of Bcl-2 conversion, in which binding of NuBCP-9 or its
enantiomer to Bcl-2 loop dislodges its BH4 domain, leading to a pro-apoptotic conformation
that exposes the BH3 domain.
NuBCP-9 disrupts Bcl-2 interaction with tBid in liposomes
We next determined how NuBCP-9-induced changes in Bcl-2 conformation resulted in Bax
activation and apoptosis. One way that Bcl-2 prevents death is by sequestering activator BH3only family members (such as Bid) and preventing their interaction with Bax/Bak (Cheng et

al., 2001; Kuwana et al., 2005; Letai et al., 2002). We recently showed that the interaction
between membrane-bound Bcl-2 and tBid resulted in a conformational alteration in the Bcl-2,
which induced permeabilization of liposomal membrane to 0.5-kDa fluorescent dye, Cascade
Blue (CB) (Peng et al., 2006). Unlike the interaction of tBid with Bax, the pore sizes in
liposomal membranes, which result from the interaction of tBid with Bcl-2, are relatively small,
allowing the release of CB but not CB-labeled 10 kDa dextrans. Although the physiological
significance of the tBid-induced Bcl-2 membrane-permeabilizing activity is largely elusive, it
offered an opportunity to study the effect of NuBCP-9 on tBid/Bcl-2 interaction in liposomes.
When NuBCP-9 was added with Bcl-2 and tBid to liposomes, NuBCP-9 but not NuBCP-9/
AA inhibited the membrane permeabilization induced by tBid/Bcl-2 interaction in a dose
dependent manner (Figure 7E). NuBCP-9, at 1 µM, was sufficient for inhibition, which could
not be further increased by using 10 µM peptide. This result suggests that 10 µM is a saturating
peptide concentration, consistent with our binding studies (Figure 4E). NuBCP-9 alone had no
effect on the membrane permeability even at the highest dose (10 µM). Thus, NuBCP-9 can
inhibit the interaction of Bcl-2 with an activator BH3-only protein, which in turn may activate
Bax.
NuBCP-9 does not convert Bcl-2 to a direct activator of Bax

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Some BH3-only proteins including Bid and Bim (termed activators) induce Bax/Bak
oligomerization through their direct interaction with Bax/Bak (Cheng et al., 2001; Kuwana et
al., 2005; Letai et al., 2002). We then tested if the NuBCP-9-converted Bcl-2 could also
function as a direct activator of Bax. As shown in Figure 7F, while adding NuBCP-9 even at
a saturating concentration of 10 µM to 50 nM Bcl-2 induced a marginal but reproducible
membrane permeabilization of liposomes, the further addition of 50 nM Bax failed to increase
the membrane permeability. In contrast, 5 nM tBid strongly induced membrane
permeabilization by 50 nM Bax, releasing a cytochrome c surrogate, 10-kDa CB-dextran
(Figure 8E). Thus, NuBCP-9 does not induce Bcl-2 to directly activate Bax.
BH3 peptide from Bcl-2 reverses Bcl-XL’s inhibition of tBid-activated Bax in liposomes

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To study whether NuBCP-9 induced exposure of BH3 domain in Bcl-2 acts indirectly to induce
apoptosis by competing with Bax or Bak for the BH3 binding pockets of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2
family members, we mutated two highly conserved BH3 residues (Leu97 and Asp102) in Bcl-2
(Figure 8A) that correspond with residues in the Bak BH3 peptide that are required for
displacing BH3 proteins and peptides from the BH3 binding pockets of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2
family members (Sattler et al., 1997). The Bcl-2 double mutant (Bcl-2/L97A/D102A) acted
dominant-negatively, suppressing Nur77 peptide-induced apoptosis (Figure 8B). We then
tested whether the Bcl-2 BH3 peptide could directly inhibit Bcl-XL blocking of tBid-induced
Bax permeabilization of liposomes encapsulating the large 10-kDa CB-dextrans. As shown in
Figure 8C, the inhibitory effect of Bcl-XL was reversed by the Bcl-2 BH3 in a dose-dependent
manner, while the mutant BH3 peptide had no effect. Also, the Bcl-2 BH3 peptide alone did
not induce Bax-dependent membrane permeabilization consistent with the observation that the
addition of NuBCP-9 to Bcl-2 did not induce Bax-dependent membrane permeability (Figure
7F). Next, we showed using the FPA that F5M-Cys labeled Bcl-2 BH3 peptide but not the
double mutant peptide bound to GST-Bcl-XL protein (Kd=144.6 +/− 11 nM) (Figure 8D).
Binding of the Bcl-2 BH3 peptide to Bcl-XL confirmed a previous report (Sattler et al.,
1997).
We next determined whether Bcl-2 in the presence of NuBCP-9 could mimic the inhibitory
effect of the Bcl-2 BH3 peptide on the activity of Bcl-XL against tBid-activated Bax. A
saturating concentration of NuBCP-9 (10 µM) was pre-incubated with Bcl-2 protein to insure
full conversion before adding Bcl-XL. Figure 8E shows that Bcl-XL inhibition of tBid induced
Bax permeablization was reversed by NuBCP-9 in a Bcl-2-dependent manner. In contrast, the

addition of Bcl-2 to Bcl-XL further inhibited the tBid-induced Bax activity. Also, Figure 8E
shows that similar to Bcl-XL, Bcl-2 alone inhibited the tBid/Bax-mediated membrane
permeabilization. Unlike the Bcl-XL case, the Bcl-2 inhibition is reversed by the addition of
NuBCP-9. We have tested extensively, using different ratios of Bcl-2/peptide or Bcl-2/Bax,
and failed to observe full release of dye by NuBCP-9, suggesting that it cannot convert Bcl-2
to a direct activator of Bax. Together, our liposome results demonstrate that NuBCP-9-induced
Bcl-2 conformational change not only neutralizes Bcl-2’s inhibition of Bax-mediated
membrane permeabilization but also exposes the Bcl-2’s BH3 motif neutralizing Bcl-XL’s
inhibition of Bax (Figure 8F).

DISCUSSION

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Here we report the identification and characterization of a nine amino acid, Nur77 Bcl-2
converting peptide (NuBCP-9), which potently induces apoptosis through a pathway that is
potentiated by Bcl-2 expression in vitro and in animals (Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure S3, and S4).
Bcl-2 is an attractive drug target, because its levels are elevated in a majority of human cancers
and correlate with the resistance of cancer cells to many chemotherapeutic drugs and γirradiation. From a therapeutic viewpoint, Bcl-2 overexpression may be advantageous because
it distinguishes many cancer cells from normal cells. In this regard, several strategies taking
advantage of this difference are currently being investigated, which may lead to improved
cancer treatments. Currently, targeting Bcl-2 has mostly relied on antisense oligonucleotides
that inhibit Bcl-2 expression or BH3 peptides and small molecule surrogates that bind the Bcl-2
BH3 binding pocket, antagonizing its anti-apoptotic (Bouillet and Strasser, 2002;Degterev et
al., 2001;Oltersdorf et al., 2005;Reed, 2002;Walensky et al., 2004). Although it has been known
for some time that Bcl-2 can be converted to a pro-apoptotic form using caspase-3 (Cheng et
al., 1997;Grandgirard et al., 1998) or activating proteins including Nur77 (Lin et al., 2004), it
has been unclear whether this conversion provides a basis for cancer drug development.
NuBCP-9 acts by inducing a Bcl-2 conformational change raising prospects that NuBCP-9based drugs and small molecule Bcl-2 converters might be developed for treating cancers with
elevated levels of Bcl-2. The NuBCP-9 enantiomer is a D-peptide which are protease resistant
(Zhou et al., 2002), an important consideration for peptide-based drug development, while
short peptides are sometimes forerunners for small molecule drug development. Our
observation that NuBCP-9 and its enantiomer effectively induced tumor regression in animals
establishes them as potential therapeutic leads for the treatment of Bcl-2-overexpressing
cancers.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Our data demonstrates that NuBCP-9 induces a Bcl-2 conformational change by binding the
Bcl-2 loop to dislodge its BH4 domain (Figure 7A–C) which exposes the BH3 domain (Figure
4, Figure 7D and Figure S7). Our results provide further support for the Bcl-2 loop as a regulator
of its activity. The Bcl-2 loop is predicted to be natively unstructured (Figure S11). Recent
studies have shown that a large unstructured loop can bind different proteins by structural
adaptation through coupled folding (Dyson and Wright, 2005). The majority of human cancerassociated and signaling proteins are predicted to have large, natively unstructured loops. that
may account for their positions at the centers of many biological processes (Dyson and Wright,
2005; Li, 2005; Iakoucheva et al., 2002). The observation that both NuBCP-9 and its
enantiomer bind the Bcl-2 loop may be a manifestation of an unstructured, conformationally
adaptable loop. The Bcl-2 family of proteins is central to apoptosis. Thus it is not surprising
that the Bcl-2 loop shares many of the characteristics of structurally adaptable regulatory loops,
including its large size (69 residues), high proline content (22%), several phosphorylation and
caspase cleavage sites and at least five different protein binding partners (Bruey et al., 2007;
Deng et al., 2006; Kang et al., 2005; Lin et al., 2004; Ueno et al., 2000). Consequently, it might
be expected that Bcl-2 conversion is subjected to multiple levels of regulation, depending on
cell type and cellular environment. Of particular interest is that the Bcl-2 loop is enriched by

proline residues, which are widely distributed in disordered regulatory loops of proteins from
prokaryotes to eukaryotes and display promiscuity and versatility in protein-protein
interactions (Li, 2005). Structural analysis of the Bcl-2/NuBCP complex will eventually
resolve whether these proline-rich sequences are responsible for binding to NuBCP-9 and its
enantiomer. As many human-cancer-associated and signaling proteins contain large, natively
disordered regulatory loops (Dyson and Wright, 2005; Iakoucheva et al., 2002; Li, 2005),
proteolytic stable D-peptides may provide a rich source for new drug leads

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Induction of apoptosis by NuBCP-9 required expression of either Bax or Bak (Figure 1H) and
was associated with their activation (Figure 6). However, the addition of NuBCP-9 to Bcl-2,
unlike tBid, did not induce Bax-dependent permeabilization of mitochondria-outer-membrane
liposomes (Figure 7F), arguing against a direct activation mechanism. Consistent with an
indirect activation mechanism, we found that NuBCP-9 inhibited Bcl-2 interaction with tBid
(Figure 7E), suggesting that NuBCP-9 may indirectly induce Bax activation by inhibiting Bcl-2
interaction with activator BH3-only proteins. Investigating this further, our liposome data
showed that inhibition of tBid-activated Bax by Bcl-2 or Bcl-XL was reversed by NuBCP-9
(Figure 8E). Our results are reminiscent of previous studies showing that phosphorylation of
the nonstructured loop prevented Bcl- 2 from binding to multidomain pro-apoptotic members
(Bassik et al., 2004) and Beclin 1, a BH3-containing autophagic protein (Wei et al., 2008).
Thus, NuBCP-9, similar to BH3 peptides or their small molecule surrogates, can prevent Bcl-2
from binding and sequestering pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members.
One unique property of NuBCP-9, which distinguished it from Bcl-2 inhibitors, is that
NuBCP-9 not only antagonizes the survival function of Bcl-2 but also induces a Bcl-2
conformation that inhibits the survival function of its anti-apoptotic relatives, such as BclXL (Figures 8C–E). Such an effect is likely mediated by its ability to induce exposure of the
BH3 domain of Bcl-2 (Figure 4A–B, Figure 7D and Figure S7). Mutagenesis of the Bcl-2 BH3
domain showed that it is required for NuBCP-9-induced Bcl-2- dependent apoptosis. Thus
Bcl-2 BH3 mutants acted dominant-negatively to inhibit NuBCP-9-induced Bcl-2- dependent
apoptosis (Figure 6G and Figure 8B) and Bax activation (Figure 6H). Consistently, a peptide
corresponding to the BH3 domain of Bcl-2 effectively neutralized the anti-Bax effect of BclXL in liposome assays (Figure 8C). Similar to the Bcl-2 BH3 peptide, NuBCP-9 induced
exposure of the Bcl-2 BH3 domain also neutralized the inhibitory effect of Bcl-XL on Bax
activation (Figure 8E). Thus, NuBCP-9 is distinguished from Bcl-2 BH3 domain inhibitors in
that it also converts Bcl-2 into a “BH3-like” molecule that in turn inhibits its anti-apoptotic
relative Bcl-XL.

(D) Stoichiometry of binding of NuBCP-9 to GST-Bcl-2. GST-Bcl-2 was titrated with
NuBCP-9s in PBS, pH 7.6, 25°C. CD was taken at 219 nm where absorption from the free
peptide is <0.3% of protein. Stoichiometry was determined as described (Jones et al., 2002).
Data are presented as mean ± SD.
(E) Summary of binding of NuBCP-9 and its enantiomer to Bcl-2 and mutants. Kd ± SD values
for FITC-NuBCP-9-r8s binding GST-Bcl-2, GST-Bcl-2/1-90 or GST-Bcl-2/29-90 were
calculated from single-site FPA binding curves shown in Fig. 3D, Fig. 5B and 5H using Prism
software. EC50 values for unlabeled NuBCP-9s binding the same Bcl-2 constructs were
derived from single-site FPA competition curves shown in Figure 3E, Figure 5B and 5H using
Prism software. χ2 values indicate excellent agreement with a single-site binding model. Ki
values for the unlabeled NuBCP-9s were calculated from
using Kd determined
for the FITC-labeled peptides. Kd values were determined from CD binding curves (Figure 4D
and Figure 5D) using nonlinear regression analysis for a one-site-binding model. Stoichiometry
± SD was determined as described (Jones et al., 2002).

peptide (10 µM) for 8 hr, and analyzed for Bax activation as in (A). Data from one of five
experiments are shown.
(D) Inhibition of NuBCP-9-induced apoptosis by Bcl-2/1-95. DoHH2 cells transfected with
DsRed-Bcl-2/1-95 or empty vector (pCMV-DsRed, Clontech) were exposed to the indicated
peptide (10 µM) for 12 hr. Transfected cells were assessed for apoptosis by DAPI staining.
Bars represent means ± SD from three experiments.
(E) Inhibition of NuBCP-9-induced Bax activation by Bcl-2/1-95. DoHH2 cells without
transfection (left two panels) or transfected with DsRed-Bcl-2/1-95 (right four panels) were
exposed to NuBCP-9 or NuBCP-9/AA (10 µM) as indicated for 12 hr. Cells were then
immunostained with anti-Bax (6A7) antibody and analyzed by fluorescence microscopy.
About 80% of nontransfected cells exposed to NuBCP-9 showed Bax staining (green) (left
panels), while about 50% of DsRed-Bcl-2/1-95-transfected cells (red) failed to display the Bax
staining (right panels). Scale, 10 µM.
(F) Bax activation in H460 cells. Cells treated with NuBCP-9 (6 µM) for 16 hr were
immunostained with either polyclonal anti-Bax (Invitrogen) or monoclonal 6A7 anti-Bax
antibody (Sigma) (Murphy et al., 2000) and anti-rabbit or anti-mouse SRPD-conjugated
secondary antibodies. Immunofluorescence was analysed by flow cytometry. Histograms of
peptide-treated cells (red) and non-treated cells (blue) were overlaid.
(G) Dominant-negative effect of Bcl-2 mutants. H460 cells in six-well plates were transfected
with GFP (0.8 µg), empty vector (control), GFP-Bcl-2/1-90, or Bcl-2/ΔBH3 (2 µg) for 24 hr
prior to exposure to NuBCP-9 (6 µM) for another 10 hr. Apoptosis of transfected cells was

(H) Suppression of Bax activation by Bcl-2 mutants. Bcl-2 mutants were expressed and treated
as in (G) and immunostained with anti-Bax (6A7) antibody and SRPD-conjugated secondary
antibody. Bax immunoflourescence was analysed by flow cytometry. Fluorescence from
transfected cells (green histogram) was compared to that from the non-transfected cells (red
histogram) from the same transfection.

NuBCP-9 (10 µM) for 16 hr and immunostained with anti-Bax (6A7) antibody as in (F). Bax
immunoflourescence was analysed by flow cytometry. Histograms of treated (red) and
untreated (blue) cells were overlaid. Bax protein levels in MEF cells were determined by
immunoblotting and did not change with NuBCP-9 treatment.
(J) Expression of Bcl-2 in Bcl-2−/−MEFs restores Bax activation by NuBCP. Bcl-2−/−MEFs
in six-well plates were cotransfected with Bcl-2 (1 µg) and GFP or GFP-Nur77/478-504, (1
µg) and immunostained with anti-Bax (6A7) antibody. Bax immunoflourescence of GFP or
GFP- Nur77/478-504 (GFP-NuBCP) expressing cells (purple histogram) were compared to
Bcl-2 coexpressing cells (green histogram) from the same transfection by flow cytometry.

Figure 7. NuBCPs disrupt Bcl-2’s intra-molecular interaction and binding with tBid

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

(A) Intra-molecular interaction in Bcl-2. GFP-BH4 or Bcl-2/ΔBH4 was transfected alone or
together into HEK293T cells. Their interaction was analyzed by Co-IP.
(B,C) Nur77 and NuBCP-9s disrupt Bcl-2 intra-molecular interaction. The indicated
expression vectors were transfected into HEK293T cells. The effect of Nur77/ΔDBD and
Nur77/DC3 (B) or NuBCP-9s (C) on interaction between BH4 domain and Bcl-2 was analyzed
by Co-IP.
In A–C, input represent 5% of cell lysates used in the Co-IP assays, and representative data
from one out of four independent experiments are shown.
(D) Removal of BH4 domain exposes BH3 domain. HEK293T cells transfected with either
Bcl-2 or Bcl-2/ΔBH4 were stained with either anti-Bcl-2/BH3 or polyclonal anti-Bcl- 2
antibody. Scale, 10 µM.
(E) NuBCP-9 inhibits tBid/Bcl-2 interaction in liposomes. The membrane permeabilization
induced by tBid/Bcl-2 interaction was monitored by the release of 0.5-kDa CB dyes from the
liposomes after 3 hr incubation at 37 °C. The release resulted in the quenching of CB
fluorescence by the anti-CB antibody located outside of the liposomes. The extent of the release
was determined by the value of ΔFProtein/ΔFTriton as described in Supplemental Data. The effect
of NuBCP-9 or NuBCP-9/AA peptide on the release was determined by including the
corresponding peptide at indicated concentrations to the incubation. Data shown are means of
2 to 4 independent experiments with SD indicated by error bars.

D102A (2 µg) for 24 hr prior to exposure to NuBCP-9 (10 µM) for another 16 hr. Apoptosis
of transfected cells was determined by Annexin V staining. Expression of Bcl-2/L97A/D102A

(C) Bcl-2 BH3 peptide neutralizes the inhibitory effect of Bcl-XL on tBid-induced Bax
membrane permeabilizing activity in liposomes. The tBid-induced Bax activity was monitored
by the release of 10-kDa CB-dextrans from the liposomes after 3 hr incubation at 37°C. The
effect of Bcl-XL and/or Bcl-2 BH3 or its mutant peptide on the tBid/Bax-mediated CB-dextran
release was determined by including the corresponding protein and/or peptide to the incubation
at indicated concentrations. Data shown are means of 2 to 3 independent experiments with SD
(error bars).
(D) FP assay of binding of Bcl-2 BH3 peptide to Bcl-XL. The indicated concentration of GSTBcl-XL or GST protein was incubated with F5M-Bcl-2 BH3 or F5M-Bcl-2 BH3-L/A,D/A (20
nM) in duplicate in PBS, pH 7.4 at 25°C and FP determined.
(E) Bcl-2 and NuBCP-9 reverses the inhibitory effect of Bcl-XL on Bax-dependent membrane
permeabilization in liposomes. The effect of Bcl-XL (10 nM) in the presence of Bcl-2 (200
nM) and/or NuBCP-9 (10 µM) on the tBid (5 nM) /Bax (50 nM)-mediated release of 10-kDa
CB-dextrans from the liposomes was determined as described in Supplemental Data. Data
shown are means of 3 to 5 independent experiments with SD (error bars).
(F) Model of Bcl-2 conversion by NuBCP. Binding of NuBCP to the Bcl-2 loop displaces the
BH4 domain, resulting in exposure of the BH3 domain, which leads to either release of proapoptotic BH3-only members (e.g., tBid) from Bcl-2 or inhibition of other anti-apoptotic
relatives of Bcl-2 family (e.g., Bcl-XL) that leads to activation of pro-apoptotic multi-BH
domain proteins (e.g., Bax).
