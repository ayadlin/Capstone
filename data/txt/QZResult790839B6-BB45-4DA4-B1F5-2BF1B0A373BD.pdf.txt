ABSTRACT
Ribosomal proteins (RPs) are the main components of ribosomes and participate
in the self-assembly of ribosomes and protein synthesis. Recent advance has shown
that RPs play important roles in the tumorigenesis and drug resistance of various
cancers. However, the expression status and function of RPL34 in pancreatic cancer
(PC) remains unclear. In this study, we find that RPL34 is overexpressed in PC
tissues and cell lines, which is correlated with decreased methylation of its promoter.
Knockdown of RPL34 effectively suppresses the proliferation, colony formation,
migration and drug-resistance of PC cells, which are accompanied by cell cycle
arrest at the G2 phase and induction of apoptosis. In vivo assays demonstrate that
RPL34 silencing inhibits PC tumor growth and metastasis. Moreover, gene expression
profiling revealed that RPL34 silencing results in alteration of the MAPK and p53
signaling pathways. Clinically, our data indicate a positive association of RPL34
expression with tumor stage and metastasis in PCs. We revealed that RPL34 acts as
a potential onco-protein in PC, and RPL34 may be a promising biomarker for prognosis
prediction and a potential target for the treatment of PC.

may aid development of personalized treatments and
identify biomarkers for more effective diagnosis and
therapy of PC.
Ribosomal proteins (RPs) are components of
ribosomes involved in protein translation and ribosome
assembly [3], which are required for the growth and
survival of all types of cells [4]. Dysregulation of RPs is
associated with various pathological conditions including
tumorigenesis. S6K1 regulates hematopoietic stem
cell self-renewal and leukemogenesis, while RPL27A
contributes to the myelodysplastic phenotype through
ribosomal dysgenesis [5, 6]. Elevated RPL6 and RPS13
promote cell proliferation and cell cycle progression in
gastric cancer cells [7, 8]. Moreover, phosphorylation of
RPS6 attenuates DNA damage and tumor suppression in

INTRODUCTION
Pancreatic cancer (PC) is a leading cause of cancer
mortality worldwide with over 330,000 new cases and
approximately the same number of deaths annually [1].
Moreover, PC may become the second cause of cancer
death due to the mortality of PC deaths is likely to further
rise in the coming years in the United States (US) [2].
Over the past two decades, great advances have been
made in treatments for PC, including surgical resection,
chemotherapy, and radiotherapy, both individually and
in combination, however, the prognosis for PC patients,
particularly those with advanced PC, remains very poor,
with a 5-year survival rate of less than 5%. Characterizing
the molecular mechanisms underlying PC tumorigenesis

PC [9], and upregulation of RPS3 and RPL23 promotes
drug resistance in gastric cancer cells [10]. Notably,
RPL11, RPL5, RPS14, RPL4 and RPS7 could stabilize
p53 protein and function as the modulators of p53-MDM2
interaction [11, 12]. These findings suggest that RPs
may represent potential biomarkers for cancer diagnosis
and characterization of the role of RPs may aid the
development of molecular targeted cancers therapies.
RPL34 belongs to the ribosome 60S large subunit
and contains a zinc finger motif. In addition to functioning
as a ribosomal protein, RPL34 has been reported to play
an important role in other cellular processes. RPL34
regulates cell cycle transition by inhibiting Cdk4 and
Cdk5 in HeLa cells [13], and over-expression of RPL34
promotes cell proliferation in human non-small cell lung
cancer and gastric cancer [14, 15]. However, the biological
function and clinical significance of RPL34 in human PC
remains largely unknown.
In this study, we found that RPL34 was overexpressed in human PC tissues and cells, and decreased
methylation of its promoter region might contribute to
upregulation of RPL34. Further, knockdown of RPL34 by
lentivirus-delivered siRNA suppressed the proliferation,
growth, invasion and migration of PC cells in vitro and
in vivo. In addition, microarray and IPA analyses revealed
that RPL34 might work as an oncoprotein in PCs by
regulating mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)
and p53 signal networks. Our findings reveal a potential
oncogenic role for RPL34 and recommend it as a new
target for the diagnosis and therapy of PCs.

higher in PC cells than that in normal HPDE6-C7 cells,
and were highest in SW1990 and PANC-1 cells (Figure
1E). Together, these results showed that RPL34 was upregulated in PC cells and tissues.
To evaluate the correlation between RPL34
expression level and the clinical pathologic characteristics
of these 50 PC patients, the median RPL34 level was
set as the cut-off point for low and high expression. As
shown in Table 1, RPL34 levels were closely correlated
with p-AJCC stage (P = 0.016), lymph node metastasis (P
= 0.005) and angiolymphatic invasion (P = 0.021) in PC
patients, but were not significantly associated with age or
differentiation grade. These data indicated that high levels
of RPL34 predicted development of a worse PC.

Decreased methylation of the RPL34 promoter
is correlated with the up-regulation of RPL34
in PCs
There are two CpG islands, including 33 CpG sites,
2500 bp upstream of the RPL34 promoter transcriptional
regulator region (TRR) (Figure 2A), suggesting that the
methylation status of the RPL34 promoter may contribute
to up-regulation of RPL34 in PCs. We collected human PC
and pancreatic epithelial cells, and PC and corresponding
normal tissues from 10 patients and performed bisulfite
sequencing PCR to assess methylation status. We detected
fewer methylated CpG sites in the PC cells or tissues with
higher levels of RPL34 expression than in normal cells
and corresponding normal tissues (Figure 2B and 2C).
These results suggest that decreased methylation of the
RPL34 promoter may contribute to the up-regulation of
RPL34 in PCs.
We further treated HPDE6-C7 cells (highermethylated) and PANC-1 and SW1990 cells (lowermethylated) by using demethylating agent 5-Aza-dC
and/or the reversible histone deacetylase inhibitor TSA,
as shown in Supplementary Figure S1, both mRNA and
protein levels of RPL34 increased after 5-Aza-dC and
TSA treatment in HPDE6-C7 cells, but no change was
observed in PANC-1 and SW1990 cells. Taken together,
These results strongly support our conclusion that RPL34
is regulated by the methylation of its promoter.

RESULTS
RPL34 is up-regulated in pancreatic cancer and
correlated with a poor prognosis of PC patients
We used immunohistochemical staining to assess
RPL34 expression in 50 pairs of PC and matched adjacent
normal tissues. Strong RPL34 staining was detected
in almost all PC specimens, while weak staining was
observed in matched normal tissues (Figure 1A). The
RPL34 immunoscore was significantly higher in PC
tissues than matched adjacent normal tissues (Figure 1B).
We then confirmed RPL34 expression in 12 pairs of these
specimens using western blotting, the results of which
were consistent with immunohistochemical staining of the
tissues (Figure 1C).
To examine the role of RPL34 in PCs, we used
western blotting and qRT-PCR to measure its expression in
a panel of PC cell lines and the normal human pancreatic
epithelial cell line HPDE6-C7. RPL34 mRNA levels
were significantly higher in PC cells than that in normal
HPDE6-C7 cells, and expression of RPL34 was highest
in SW1990 and PANC-1 (Figure 1D). Consistent with
the up-regulation of mRNA, immunoblotting analysis
demonstrated that levels of RPL34 protein were also

Knockdown of RPL34 inhibits growth and
proliferation of PC cells in vitro
To assess the role of RPL34 in regulating malignant
PC phenotypes, we used lentivirus-delivered siRNA to
knock down RPL34 expression in PANC-1 and SW1990
cell lines, both of which expressed high levels of RPL34.
After 48 h, more than 85% cells were transduced with
RPL34-siRNA, and qRT-PCR analysis indicated that
RPL34 mRNA levels were significantly reduced in both
cell lines (Figure 3A). Similar reductions in RPL34
protein level were detected by western blot in both cell

(HCS) were performed to monitor cell growth for 5 days.
As shown in Figure 3C, silencing of RPL34 decreased
total cell numbers and slowed the growth rate of PANC1 cells. The BrdU incorporation DNA synthesis assay
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

demonstrated that RPL34 siRNA significantly reduced
proliferation of PANC-1 cells for days (Figure 3D). These
results indicate that siRNA silencing of RPL34 expression
significantly decreased DNA synthesis for 4 days, which
resulted in slowed cell growth.

Knockdown of RPL34 induces cell cycle arrest
and apoptosis of PC cells

In order to assess the effect of RPL34 on PC cell
tumorigenesis in vitro we studied colony formation of
cells in which RPL34 was knocked down by siRNA.
The number of colonies formed by RPL34 deficient
PANC-1 cells (42.67±6.03) was significantly lower than
the number formed by control cells (119.67±10.01, P <
0.01), and the morphology of RPL34 deficient PANC1 cells also differed from control cells (Figure 3E). We
obtained similar results in other cell lines, including
SW1990 and BxPC-3, transduced with RPL34 siRNA
(Supplementary Figure S4A and Figure S5A). We also
confirmed overexpression of RPL34 moderately promoted
cell proliferation and colony formation (Supplementary
Figure S2A-D). Furthermore, we tested the efficacy of
knocking down RPL34 on PANC-1 cell chemosensitivity
to gemcitabine and 5-fluorouracil (5-Fu). As shown
in Supplementary Figure S3, knockdown of RPL34
sensitized the tumor cells to gemcitabine and 5-Fu. Taken
together, these results indicate that RPL34 is critical
for the proliferation of PC cells and cell sensitivity to
chemotherapies.

To assess whether RPL34 promotes proliferation of
PC cells by regulating cell cycle progression or apoptosis,
we used PI staining to measure cell cycle distribution and
Annexin-V staining to assess apoptosis in RPL34 deficient
and control PANC-1 cells. PANC-1 cells transduced with
control siRNA had the following cell cycle distribution:
G0/G1 49.18%, S 43.77%, G2/M 7.05%; siRNA RPL34
knockdown significantly reduced the fraction of cells
in the G0/G1 and S phase, and significant increased the
fraction in the G2/M phase, with the following cell cycle
distribution: G0/G1 38.18%, S 39.15%, G2/M 22.67% (all
P < 0.01, Figure 4A). We also confirmed overexpression
of RPL34 increased the fraction of cells in the S phase,
with no obvious change in G2/M phase in AsPC-1 cells
(Supplementary Figure S2E). These data demonstrate cell
cycle progression through G2/M phase was hindered in
PANC-1 cells after RPL34 silencing. Furthermore, RPL34
knockdown significantly induced apoptosis in PANC-

± 0.33%) (Figure 4B). Similar results were observed in
SW1990 and BxPC-3 cells following RPL34 silencing by
siRNA (Supplementary Figure S4B-C and Figure S5B-C).
These results suggest that RPL34 enhances cell cycle
progression and inhibits apoptosis in PC cells.

that RPL34 might promote the progression of PC by
accelerating cell migration and invasion.

Knockdown of RPL34 suppresses pancreatic
cancer cell growth and metastasis in vivo
To extend our in vitro observations in vivo, we
generated PC mouse xenografts of PANC-1 cells stably
transfected with lentivirus-based pGCSIL-GFP vector
carrying RPL34-siRNA or negative control siRNA. 24
days after injection, the volume of RPL34-deficient
xenograft tumors were significantly smaller than control
xenograft tumors (Figure 6A).
To assess the effect of RPL34 on pancreatic tumor
metastasis in vivo, we generated lung metastasis SCID
mice models with PANC-1-luc-NC and PANC-1-lucKD cells. RPL34 mRNA and protein levels were lower
in transplanted PANC-1-luc-KD cells than PANC-1-lucNC cells (Figure 6B and 6C). The location and growth
of tumor xenografts in vivo was monitored by luciferase
imaging once a week. As shown in Figure 6D, visible
lung tumor metastases were observed in all the mice
which received PANC-1-luc-NC cells (n = 8), and 6 mice
developed metastases in other organs, including the brain,

Knockdown of RPL34 inhibits migration and
invasion of PC cells
The alteration of the morphology of PC cells
after RPL34 silencing (Figure 3E) led us to ask whether
RPL34 influences cell migration and invasion. To test
this hypothesis, wound-healing and transwell assays
were performed to investigate the role of RPL34 in
cell migration and invasion of PANC-1 cells. RPL34
knockdown substantially delayed wound closure of
scratch gaps within 12 h and 24 h (Figure 5A). Transwell
assays revealed PANC-1 cells with RPL34 silencing
demonstrated reduced invasion ability, with significantly
less cells invaded to the filter in comparison to control
cells (Figure 5B). We further confirmed overexpression
of RPL34 in AsPC-1 cells promoted cell migration
(Supplementary Figure S2F). These data suggest

or other organs metastases in RPL34KD group than that
in control group, in which lung metastases were detected
in three mice and other organ metastases were detected
in one mouse that received PANC-1-luc-KD cells (n = 8)
(Figure 6E). Moreover, the bioluminescence of PANC1-luc-NC metastases was stronger than that of PANC-1luc-KD metastases (Figure 6F). Histological analysis of
the lungs revealed fewer and smaller metastatic tumors
in mice that received PANC-1-luc-KD cells than mice
that received PANC-1-luc-NC cells (Figure 6G). Taken
together, these data demonstrate that RPL34 silencing
could effectively reduce tumor growth and metastasis of
PC in vivo.

siRNA. The data revealed that expression of 557 genes
differed by at least 2-fold (P < 0.05). Further disease and
function analysis revealed that the following particular
gene sets that were significantly enriched, including
those involved in cellular growth and proliferation,
cell death and survival, cellular development, cancer,
organism injury and abnormalities (Figure 7A). Next,
classical pathway analysis revealed that the MAPK and
P53 signaling pathways were altered following RPL34
silencing (Figure 7B). To further confirm the contribution
of MAPK signaling in RPL34-induced malignancy, we
analyzed the knowledge-based interactome surrounding
the regulation of MAPK signaling using Ingenuity
Pathway Analysis (IPA) and overlaid our microarray data
with a 2-fold change cut-off. Several genes that have been
reported to be involved in the process of tumorigenesis
were differentially regulated by RPL34, including CCL2,
ATF4, MMP1, Bcl-2, EGFR, CDK6, MDM2, FOSL2 and
JUN (Figure 7C). These data implicate the MAPK signal
pathway in the mechanism by which RPL34 promotes PC
tumorigenesis.

To elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which
RPL34 promotes malignancy of PC cells, microarray
analysis was performed to compare gene expression in
cells transduced with PANC-1 NC-siRNA and RPL34-

DISCUSSION

focused on its expression and functions in mosquitoes
and plants [18, 19]. Recently, two reports revealed RPL34
promoted cell proliferation in non-small cell lung and
gastric cancers [14, 15]; however, the roles for RPL34 in
cell malignances and the mechanisms of its dysregulation
remain unexplored in PCs.

In the past decade, several ribosomal proteins
have been found to be involved in the tumorigenesis and
progression of various cancers. RPL34 is a rarely studied
ribosomal protein and most previous studies mainly

In this study, we found that RPL34 expression was
upregulated in PC tissues and positively correlated with
pAJCC stage, lymphatic metastasis and angiolymphatic
invasion in PC patients, which indicates RPL34 might
play a crucial role in tumor development of PCs.
Aberrant promoter methylation is usually responsible
for the dysregulation of ribosomal protein expression
in cancer tissues. For example, RPS6 expression is
suppressed by promoter hypermethylation in CRC tissues
[20], and PRMT5 acts as an oncoprotein by increasing
methylation of RPS10 [21]. We analyzed the CpG sites
and methylation levels of the RPL34 promoter TRR in
PC cells and tissues, and corresponding normal cells and
tissues. Our results demonstrated the CpG methylation
status was inversely correlated with RPL34 expression,
suggesting that demethylation of RPL34 promoter induces
the overexpression of RPL34 in PCs.
Furthermore, using a lentivirus carrying RPL34
siRNA, we confirmed that silencing of RPL34 effectively
inhibited the growth, proliferation, migration and invasion
of PC both in vitro and in vivo. PC cell growth rate and
colony formation was significantly lower following
RPL34 silencing, RPL34 silencing caused both cell cycle
arrest at G2/M phase and apoptosis. moreover, mouse
xenografts of RPL34-siRNA cells grew more slowly
than those of wild-type cells, producing smaller tumors.
Intriguingly, RPL34 silencing altered cellular morphology,
and reduced the migration and invasion of PC cells in vitro
and in vivo. These results strongly suggest that RPL34
plays an oncogenic role in cell growth, proliferation and
migration in PC.
To further explore the mechanisms underlying
RPL34-mediated promotion of PC tumorigenesis, we
performed microarray analysis of PANC-1-NC and
PANC-1-RPL34-siRNA cells. Gene expression profiling
revealed that RPL34 silencing enriched expression of
genes involved in cellular growth and proliferation, cell
death and survival, and cellular development and cancer,
particularly MAPK and P53 signaling. The MAPK cascade
is a critical pathway for human cancer cell proliferation,
differentiation, migration, immune evasion and drug
resistance, and aberrant activation of MAPK signaling
is a frequent event in tumorigenesis, progression and
metastasis of most tumors [22–25]. Further analysis of the
knowledge-based interactome surrounding the regulation
of MAPK via IPA analysis demonstrated that CCL2, ATF4,
MMP1, EGFR, CXCL1 FOSL2, JUN and p53, which
have been implicated in the proliferation and metastasis
of various cancers [26–30], were found to be differentially
regulated by RPL34 (> 2-fold, P < 0.05). P53 is a major
tumor suppressor, it may also act as a downstream
effector of MAPK, which contributes to the enhancement
of cell cycle progression and proliferation by RPL34.
Importantly, p53 usually acts as a central regulatory hub
among many ribosome biogenesis regulators, and it has
been well established that the MDM2-p53 feedback loop
is regulated by ribosomal protein-mediated p53 activity
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

like RPL4, RPS14 and RPS7 [31]. additionally, RPL34
could mediate the upstream factors (Foxo families) or
downstream proteins (mTOR and AMPK) of p53 signaling
pathway by a p53 independent manner when p53 is mutant
or inactivated, like some reports found p53 mutants also
play an effective role in inhibiting autophage [32]. Our
findings suggest that RPL34 might be a novel regulator of
the MDM2-p53 loop in PCs. However, the key molecules
or pathways responsible for the malignant functions of
RPL34 require further exploration.
Taken together, we found aberrant expression and
identified novel functions of RPL34 in PC, and explored
the molecular mechanisms underlying the tumorigenic
role of RPL34 in PC. Our findings suggest that RPL34
is a potential biomarker for the diagnosis, prognosis and
development of targeted therapy for PC.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients and tissue samples
Fifty patients diagnosed with PC were enrolled at
the Department of Hepatobiliary and Pancreas Surgery,
the First Hospital of Jilin University between January
2011 and December 2013. The clinical and pathologic
characteristics of the patient cohort are summarized in
Table 1. All fresh tissue samples were paraffin-embedded,
or snap-frozen immediately after resection and stored in
liquid nitrogen. Informed consent was obtained form each
patient and the protocols were approved by the Ethics
Committee of the First Hospital of Jilin University.

Immunohistochemistry analysis
The paraffin sections were deparaffinized,
rehydrated in deionized water, and then exposed to
3% H2O2 and 1% BSA, followed by incubation with
anti-RPL34 (1:50) antibody overnight and secondary
antibody (RTU Vectastain kit, Vector Laboratories,
Burlingame, CA) [16]. Sections were stained by DAB and
hematoxylin. Images were acquired using an Olympus
BX41 microscope. Semi-quantitative evaluation of IHC
staining of RPL34 was carried out using immunoscore
based on both the percentage of stained cells and staining
intensity, as previously described [16, 17]. The intensity
score was defined as follows: 0, no appreciable staining; 1,
weak intensity; 2, moderate intensity; 3, strong intensity;
4, very strong intensity. The fraction score was based on
the proportion of positively stained cells (0–100%). The
mean of the immunoscores from ten microscopic high
power fields was recorded.

Oncotarget

Collection of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (Shanghai,
China) and cultured in DMEM medium (Hyclone)
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (GIBCO) at
37°C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2.
Stable PANC-1-luc-NC and PANC-1-luc-KD cell lines
were established using lentivirus pGC-FU-LUC-IRESPuromycin carrying control or RPL34-shRNA sequences.
Cells were selected by culture in puromycin (2.5 μg/ml)
and were continually passaged at low density to allow for
election of subclones with acquired puromycin resistance.

each day. The system includes a computerized, automated
fluorescence-imaging microscope that automatically
identifies stained cells and reports the intensity and
distribution of fluorescence in each cell. Images were
acquired for each fluorescence channel (20 ×). To measure
proliferation, DNA synthesis was assessed by BrdU
incorporation assay using a Brdu kit (Roche) following
the manufacturer’s instructions, with the cells pulsed with
Brdu for 12h at each time point.

Cell migration and invasion assay

Lentivirus vector construction and transduction

For cell migration assay, cells were seeded in
6-well plates (1 x 105 cells/well) and a scratch wound
was made by scraping confluent cells with sterile pipette
tips, and images were captured 12 h or 24 h later. For
invasion assay, cells in 200 μl serum-free 1640 medium
were seeded in the upper insert of 6.5 mm transwell
chambers with 8 μm pores (Costar, Cambridge, MA,
USA) pre-coated with matrigel (1:4, BD), then 500 μl
complete medium was added into the lower chambers.
After 24 h, medium was removed and the upper surface
of each membrane was cleaned with cotton swab. The
cells adhering to the insert surface were stained with
DAPI and images were acquired using Olympus BX41
microscopy.

Double-stranded RPL34-targeted siRNA sequences
(5′- CCTAAAGTTCTTATGAGAT-3′) were synthesized
and cloned into the lentivirus-based pGCSIL-GFP
vector with AgeI/EcoRI sites by GeneChem Corporation
(Shanghai, China). The negative control lentiviral vector
(5′-TTCTCCGAACGTGTCACGT-3′) was generated,
which shared no homology with any known human genes.
For lentivirus transduction, cells were seeded in six-well
plates until cell confluence reached 70%, then lentivirus
was added to achieve the multiplicity of infection of 1.
After 72 h, cells were observed under a fluorescence
microscope and harvested for the following experiments.

Bisulfite sequencing PCR (BSP) of the
RPL34 gene

Establishment of pancreatic cancer xenograft
model in nude or SCID mice

The primers used to detect methylation of the
CpG islands were designed to specifically amplify
bisulfite-converted DNA of RPL34 promoter
transcriptional regulator region (TRR). The primers
were
RPL34-1F:
5’-AAGTGTTTATGATAA(C/T)
GAAAGAAGTTG-3’;
RPL34-1R:
5’-AACAA
CATCCATACCTACAAACAAC-3’;
RPL34-2F:
5’-AGGGATTTTG
TTGTATTTTAAGTGTAG-3’;
RPL34-2R: 5’-AAAAACCATTATTCTATTTACATCT
CC-3’. Aliquots of the bisulfite-modified DNA from
PC cells or tissues were subjected to PCR analysis. The
reaction was preheated at 95°C for 5 min, and amplified
using a touch-down PCR program: 10 cycles of 95°C for
30 s, 60°C for 45 s (with touch down 1°C per cycle), and
72°C for 45 s; 30 cycles of 95°C for 30 s, 50°C for 45 s,
and 72°C for 45 s, and finally 60°C for 30 min. The PCR
products were cloned into the pMD 18-T Vector (TaKaRa),
then 10 clones from each sample were randomly selected
for DNA sequencing by Comate Bioscience (Jilin, China).

Animal experiments were performed following
the protocols approved by Institutional Animal Care and
Use Committees of Jilin University. Nude (BALB/C-nu/
nu) mice and SCID (severe combined immunodeficient)
mice were obtained from Vital River Laboratory Animal
Technology (Beijing, China). 5×106 PANC-1 cells stably
transduced with lentivirus-based pGCSIL-GFP vector
carrying negative control and RPL34-siRNA were
suspended in HBSS and injected subcutaneously into
the flank region of 6-week-old female athymic nude
(BALB/C-nu/nu) mice (Vital River Laboratory Animal
Technology, Beijing, China). The tumors were monitored
and grown to an average volume of 200 mm3. Tumor
size was assessed by caliper every other day and tumor
volumes were calculated after 24 days using the formula:
V = 4/3 × π (length/2 × (width/2)2).
To establish a metastasis model, SCID mice
were injected with 1× 106 viable PANC-1-luc-NC and
PANC-1-luc-KD cells via tail veins. Successful injection
was confirmed by immediate luciferase imaging.
For luciferase imaging, mice were anesthetized with
isoflurane and intraperitoneally injected with luciferin
(25 mg/ml in 0.1 ml PBS). Animals were imaged 15
min after injection using an IVIS LuminaXR system
(Caliper, Hopkinton, MA, USA) once a week for a total
of six weeks.

Cell growth and proliferation assays
Multiparametric high-content screening (HCS) was
used to determine cell growth. Briefly, cells were seeded in
96-well plates (1,000 cells/well) and continuously cultured
for 5 days. Plates were processed with the ArrayScan™
HCS software (Cellomics Inc. Halethorpe, MD, USA)
