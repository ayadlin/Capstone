Abstract
Statins are inhibitors of cholesterol biosynthesis and protein prenylation that also have been studied in cancer
therapy and chemoprevention. With regard to natural killer (NK) cells, only inhibitory effects of statins such as
suppression of granule exocytosis have been reported so far. In this study, we show that statins can cooperate
with IL-2 to potently induce the activation of CD56dim NK cells in a synergistic, time- and dose-dependent
fashion. Supplementation experiments revealed that the statin effect was specific to inhibition of their target
hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase and that downstream depletion of geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate
was responsible for cooperating with IL-2 in NK cell activation. Mechanistic studies revealed that CD56þHLADRþCD14þ dendritic cell (DC)-like accessory cells mediated the ability of statin to activate NK cells. In contrast,
BDCA-1þ (CD1cþ) myeloid DCs, which partially expressed CD56, were somewhat less potent. Conventional
blood monocytes, which lack CD56, exhibited the lowest accessory cell capacity. NK cell IFN-g production was
IL-12 independent but required endogenous IL-18, IL-1b, and caspase-1 activity. Statins directly induced
apoptosis in human cancer cell lines and cooperated with NK cell–derived IFN-g to generate potent cytotoxic
antitumor effects in vitro even in the presence of statin-mediated inhibitory effects on granule exocytosis. Our
work reveals novel and unexpected immunomodulatory properties of statins, which might be harnessed for the
treatment of cancer. Cancer Res; 70(23); 9611–20. 2010 AACR.

Introduction
Statins, which are primarily used to control hypercholesterolemia, have also been proposed as anticancer agents (1, 2).
They inhibit hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA)
reductase, the first committed step of the mevalonate pathway. Mevalonate, the immediate product of HMG-CoA, is
further metabolized to form important cellular products such
as cholesterol or farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) as well as
geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP; refs. 3, 4), which are
required for protein prenylation (3, 4). Prenylation frequently
occurs on small GTPases of the RAS superfamily (2).
Statin-mediated inhibition of mevalonate metabolism
affects many downstream pathways and may thus influence

cell membrane integrity, steroid content, cell signaling, and
respiration, as well as inflammatory and immune responses (1,
2). Because these pathways are all critical for cancer development and progression, statin-mediated inhibition of these
processes is believed to inhibit tumor initiation, growth, and
metastasis.
Modulation of protein prenylation is considered a key
mechanism, by which statins alter inflammatory and immune
responses (4). Although it is well established that statins are
predominantly anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive
agents, an increasing number of studies have shown that
statins may also induce proinflammatory responses depending on costimulatory signals (5–8). In contrast, with regard to
NK cells, only inhibitory effects have been reported so far (9–
12). However, all these studies focused on NK cell–target cell
interactions but did not investigate the role of antigen-presenting cells (APC) in statin-mediated NK cell modulation.
We and others have previously detected an HLA-DRþCD14þ
cell subset in human blood that expresses the CD56 antigen
(¼ neural cell adhesion molecule; refs. 13–15), which is constitutively expressed by NK cells and may be induced by some
T-cell subsets during activation (16, 17). These monocyte/
dendritic cell (DC)-like cells have been shown to be phenotypically and functionally similar to conventional DCs (13–15).
In the present work, we report, for what we believe to be the
first time, that statins not only have direct antitumor effects
but may also induce the activation of human NK cells via an

intriguing subset of CD56þ DC-like cells to increase their
antitumor efficacy.

Materials and Methods
Reagents, antibodies, and cell lines
Mevastatin, simvastatin, and mevalonolactone were
obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Mevastatin, which is isolated
from Penicillium citrinum, was the founding member of the
statin family. It is not used in therapy but serves as a precursor
in the synthesis of other statins. In contrast, simvastatin
(Zocor and others), which is a synthetic derivative of a
fermentation product of Aspergillus terreus, is a widely prescribed statin (Supplementary Fig. S1; ref. 18).
FPP and GGPP were purchased from Echelon Biosciences.
Squalene synthase inhibitor YM-53601 was obtained from
Cayman Chemical. Recombinant human IL-2 (Proleukin)
was from Novartis. Recombinant IL-12 and IL-18 were
obtained from Bender MedSystems. Anti-CD3 (SK7-PerCPCy5.5), anti-CD14 (MP9-FITC, MP9-APC), anti-CD54 (HA58PE), anti-CD56 (NKH-1-PE), anti-CD86 (FUN-1-FITC), antiHLA-ABC (G46-2.6-FITC), and anti-HLA-DR (T36-PE) were all
from BD Biosciences; anti-Slan (M-DC8; DD-1-APC) was from
Miltenyi Biotec; neutralizing anti-IL-18 (125-2H) was from
MBL; neutralizing anti-IL-1b (8516) and anti-IL-12 (24910)
were from R&D; neutralizing anti-IFN-g (25718.11) was from
Sigma-Aldrich; caspase-1 inhibitor Ac-Tyr-Val-Ala-Asp-2,6dimethylbenzoyloxymethyl-ketone (YVAD) was purchased
from Alexis Biochemicals.
A-498, MCF-7, DU-145, and LNCaP represent well-studied
examples of kidney (A-498), breast (MCF-7), and prostate
cancer (DU-145, LNCaP), respectively. A-498 was obtained
from the DSMZ (19–21). MCF-7 (22, 23) was kindly provided
by Martin Wurm, Department of Internal Medicine, Innsbruck
Medical University. DU-145 (24) and LNCaP (25, 26) were
kindly provided by Helmut Klocker, Department of Urology,
Innsbruck Medical University. All cell lines were cultured in
complete BioWhittaker RPMI 1640 (Lonza) supplemented
with 10% FCS (HyClone). LNCaP culture medium was further
supplemented with glucose (2.5%).
Cell isolation and depletion
All donors gave written informed consent in accordance
with the Declaration of Helsinki to the use of their residual
buffy coats for research purposes, with approval from the
University Hospital of Innsbruck Review Board. CD56þ cells
were purified from peripheral blood mononuclear cells
(PBMC), using CD56 microbeads and LS columns. In some
experiments, PBMCs or CD56þ PBMCs were depleted of
CD14þ cells, using CD14 microbeads and LD columns. In
other experiments, PBMCs or CD14þ PBMCs were depleted of
CD56þ cells. All procedures were conducted according to the
manufacturer's instructions (Miltenyi Biotec).
Phenotypic analyses
For phenotyping, freshly isolated or cultured cells [(1–3) 
105] were stained with specific fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies in PBS containing 0.5% FCS and 50 mg/mL of human

9612

IgG (Octapharma) to block Fc g receptors. After a 30-minute
incubation on ice followed by 2 washes, cells were analyzed
using a FACSCanto II system and FACSDiva 6.1.2 and FlowJo
V7.2.5 software (BD Biosciences).
Cell culture and stimulation
All cell cultures were conducted in complete BioWhittaker
RPMI 1640 (Lonza) supplemented with 10% FCS (HyClone).
For cytokine measurements, cells (1  106/mL) were stimulated with IL-2 (100 U/mL) either alone or in combination
with statin (0.1–5 mmol/L) in 96-well round-bottomed plates
(0.2 mL). After 1 to 3 days, supernatants were harvested for
cytokine analysis. For neutralizing and blocking assays, cultures were preincubated with specific antibodies or inhibitors.
Cellular responses were also documented with an Olympus
CK2 microscope equipped with a ProgRes CT3 digital camera
and ProgRes CapturePro 2.5 software (Jenoptik).
Cytokine measurements
Cytokine levels were assessed on days 1 to 3 in culture
supernatants, using cytometric Cytokine Bead Arrays (CBA;
BD Biosciences). Samples were analyzed with a FACSCanto
II system and FCAP Array 1.0.1 software from BD Biosciences.
For intracellular staining of IFN-g, cells (1.5  106/mL)
were stimulated in RPMI-10% FCS with IL-2 (100 U/mL) or
mevastatin (5 mmol/L) plus IL-2 for 2 to 3 days. During the
last 3 to 4 hours, cells were treated with Brefeldin A (BFA; BD
Biosciences) and were then harvested, washed, and stained
with fluorochrome-conjugated anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody (mAb) or anti-CD56 mAb for 30 minutes at 4 C. Cells
were washed twice and treated with FIX&PERM (An der
Grub Bioresearch). Fixed, permeabilized cells were stained
with fluorochrome-conjugated anti-IFN-g antibody. After 2
more washes, the cells were analyzed with a FACSCanto II
system.
Apoptosis assay
Culture supernatants were analyzed for the presence of
caspase-cleaved cytokeratin-18 on days 2 to 3. Cytokeratin-18
is selectively expressed in cells of epithelial origin. A specific
antibody was used to detect a neoepitope of cytokeratin-18
(CK18-Asp396), which is released after cleavage by multiple
caspases during apoptosis (M30 CytoDeath ELISA, PEVIVA).
Statistical analyses
Group comparisons were carried out using Student's t test.
All calculated P values are results of 1-sided tests. A value of
P  0.05 was considered statistically significant. Microsoft
Excel was used for calculations.

concentrated within the CD56þ subset and was completely
abrogated when CD14þ or CD56þ cells were depleted from
PBMCs prior to stimulation (Fig. 1B).
In all subsequent experiments, we focused on the CD56þ
subset of PBMCs to further study the role of mevalonate
pathway intermediates in the interactions between CD56þ
innate lymphocytes and CD56þ APCs. In 16 different donors,
11.7  2.5% of total PBMCs were CD56þ. CD56þ PBMCs
consisted mainly of NK cells (52.5  19.5%) and also of a
CD3þ T-cell subset (23.6  7.3%), which harbored a substantial gd T-cell population ranging from 20% to 69.5% of all
CD56þ T cells (13). Moreover, we and others have shown that
CD56þ PBMCs also harbor CD14þ monocyte/DC-like APCs
(10.7  5.7%; Fig. 2A; refs. 13–15).

Dose and time dependence of statin-induced IFN-g

Experiments using increasing concentrations of statin
revealed that the dose–response relationship was nonlinear
and more likely reflected an on-off mechanism with a threshold between 1 and 2 mmol/L of statin (Fig. 2B). The response
was rapid and resulted in already substantial amounts of IFNg within 24 hours and in large amounts of IFN-g within 2 to
3 days (Fig. 2C).

Specificity of the statin effect to HMG-CoA reductase
inhibition and to suppression of protein prenylation
To ascertain whether the effect of statin was specific to
the inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase, the cultures were
supplemented with mevalonate, the immediate product of
HMG-CoA reductase, which allows the biosynthetic pathway
to proceed despite statin-mediated inhibition of HMG-CoA
reductase. As shown in Figure 3A, mevalonate at 10 mmol/L

observed that mevastatin induced IFN-g production in human
PBMCs when IL-2 was present (Fig. 1B). The response was

statin-mediated inhibition of the cholesterol biosynthesis

CD56dim NK cells produce IFN-g in response to statin
plus IL-2
To identify the cellular source of IFN-g, we performed
intracellular staining of IFN-g in CD56þ PBMCs after stimulation with statin plus IL-2. Cells were counterstained for CD3
and CD56 to distinguish T from NK cells as well as CD56bright
from CD56dim NK cells (28, 29). Data shown in Figure 4A clearly
indicate that IFN-g was almost exclusively produced by
CD3CD56þ cells (i.e., NK cells). Among NK cells, only CD56dim
cells (i.e., cytotoxic NK cells) produced IFN-g (Fig. 4B).
CD56þ monocyte/DC-like cells are required for NK cell
activation in response to statin plus IL-2
We then investigated the IFN-g response as an indication of
the interaction between NK cells and monocyte/DC-like cells
known to be present within the subset of CD56þ PBMCs (13–
15). Phenotypic analyses revealed that freshly isolated monocyte/DC-like cells expressed not only higher levels of CD14
than conventional CD56CD14þ peripheral blood monocytes
but also significantly higher levels of MHC class I (HLA-ABC),
MHC class II (HLA-DR), costimulatory (CD86), and adhesion
(CD54) molecules (Supplementary Fig. S2). Moreover, these
monocyte/DC-like cells substantially upregulated all surface
markers within 1 day of culture in the absence of exogenous
factors and presented with even higher levels of these molecules after statin treatment (Supplementary Fig. S2). Slan
(M-DC8; 6-Sulfo LacNAc) is a carbohydrate modification of Pselectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1), which is expressed on
CD14lowCD16þ monocyte/DC-like cells (30, 31). Although Slan
was readily detectable on 3% to 4% of CD56 peripheral blood

monocytes, we failed to detect Slan on CD56þ monocyte/DClike cells. Likewise, CD56þ monocyte/DC-like cells also lacked
CD1c (BDCA-1), which is expressed on a major subpopulation of
human myeloid blood DCs (data not shown; ref. 32).
To examine the functional role of CD56þ monocyte/DC-like
cells, we tested the response of CD56þ PBMCs that had been
depleted of CD14þ cells prior to stimulation with statin plus
IL-2. Importantly, depletion of CD56þCD14þ monocyte/DClike cells was accompanied by a complete loss of IFN-g
(Fig. 5A), IL-1b, and IL-6 production (not shown).
To test whether CD56þ monocyte/DC-like cells are sufficient for NK cell activation in response to statin plus IL-2,
CD56þ PBMCs were isolated and CD56þ DC-like cells
(CD14þCD3), NK cells (CD3CD14), and T cells
(CD3þCD14) were sorted with a FACS system. The individual
cell populations were remixed and cocultured in the presence
of statin plus IL-2. The results shown in Supplementary Figure
S3 confirm that CD56þ DC-like cells are both required and
sufficient to activate NK cells. However, in the presence of T
cells, the response was further enhanced, indicating that T
cells can also contribute to the observed response.
When sorted CD56þ DC-like cells and NK cells were seeded
separately in the upper or lower chamber of transwells,
respectively, to prevent cell-to-cell contact, the levels of
IFN-g were significantly lower (20 ng/mL) than the levels
of IFN-g present in remixed cultures of CD56þ DCs and NK
cells (60 ng/mL). However, IFN-g production was still substantial under conditions of physical separation, indicating
that cell-to-cell contact is not required but can enhance IFN-g
production.
To clarify whether CD56þCD14þ monocyte/DC-like cells are
especially adept at activating NK cells in response to statin plus
IL-2, we compared various APCs as accessory cells. For this
purpose, CD56þ PBMCs were depleted of CD14þ cells to

CD56 monocytes), or CD56þ monocyte/DC-like cells. As
shown in Figure 5A, BDCA-1þ myeloid DCs also served as
accessory cells, although they were somewhat less potent than
CD56þ monocyte/DC-like cells. Control stainings shown in
Figure 5B surprisingly revealed partial expression of CD56 by
BDCA-1 myeloid DCs. Conventional blood monocytes, which
lack CD56, exhibited the lowest accessory cell capacity
(Fig. 5A).
The importance of CD56þ monocyte/DC-like cells was also
reflected by the correlation between the frequency of monocyte/DC-like cells within the CD56þ PBMCs and the actual level
of IFN-g production (Fig. 5B). IFN-g production in CD56þ cell
preparations from donors containing a rather small monocyte/
DC population (5%) was clearly less efficient than IFN-g
production in CD56þ cell preparations from donors containing
a relatively large monocyte/DC population (15%; Fig. 5B).

IFN-g production in response to statin plus IL-2
depends on endogenous IL-18, IL-1b, and caspase-1
IL-12 is a major IFN-g–inducing cytokine. In our cytokine
analyses, we failed to detect IL-12 in supernatants of cultures
stimulated with statin plus IL-2. In addition, IL-12p70–neutralizing antibodies completely failed to inhibit IFN-g production, indicating that IL-12 is not involved (not shown). In
contrast, antibodies neutralizing IL-18 bioactivity strongly
reduced IFN-g production induced by statin plus IL-2 in
cultures of CD56þ PBMCs (P ¼ 0.002; Fig. 6A). Although
somewhat less effective, neutralization of IL-1b also inhibited
IFN-g production (P ¼ 0.009). Moreover, concomitant neutralization of both IL-18 and IL-1b abolished IFN-g production
almost completely (P ¼ 0.002; Fig. 6A). Because both cytokines
require caspase-1 for activation (33, 34), we also tested the
effects of the caspase-1 inhibitor YVAD (35) on IFN-g production induced by statin plus IL-2. YVAD alone was capable of
completely abrogating the IFN-g response (P ¼ 0.002; Fig. 6A).
Both mevastatin and simvastatin acted in synergy with IL-2 to

indicated that IL-18 and IL-1b are the endogenous mediators
of the statin-induced IFN-g response.
CD56dim NK cells activated in the presence of statin
have limited degranulation capacity
In addition to the cytokine-producing capacity, we wanted
to assess the cytotoxic activity of NK cells in our system.
Previous work has demonstrated that statins may inhibit NK
cell degranulation and cytotoxicity (10). One way to assess the
cytotoxic function of NK cells is to measure the mobilization
of CD107a (lysome-associated membrane protein-1, LAMP-1)
to the cell surface by flow cytometry (Supplementary Methods;
36). Consistent with previous reports (10), we found that

www.aacrjournals.org

cytokine-induced CD107a surface exposure was prevented
in statin-treated NK cells (Supplementary Fig. S4).
NK cell–derived IFN-g and statin cooperate to generate
potent cytotoxic effects
In addition to the degranulation capacity, we wanted to
study the cytotoxic antitumor effects of NK cells activated
with statin plus IL-2. For this purpose, we used A-498 cells, a
well-characterized example of human RCC (19–21, 37), and
cultured them in 96-well round-bottom plates. CD56þ PBMCs
were then added and stimulated with statin and IL-2. While
the A-498 cell monolayer seemed relatively intact in the
presence of statin or IL-2 alone, the combination of statin
and IL-2 induced an almost complete destruction of the
epithelial cell monolayer indicative of potent cytotoxicity
(Fig. 7A). However, the observed strong cytotoxicity of
CD56þ PBMCs stimulated with statin plus IL-2 was in apparent contrast with the inhibitory effects of statin on NK cell
degranulation (Supplementary Fig. S4; ref. 10) and suggested
that other mechanisms were active.
To examine the role of soluble factors generated during
stimulation of CD56þ PBMCs in the cytotoxicity against A-498
cells, the effects of cell-free conditioned media (CM) on A-498
cells were examined. The ability of soluble factors contained in
CM to induce apoptosis of A-498 cells was investigated by
measuring the release of caspase-cleaved cytokeratin-18
(CK18-Asp396) from apoptotic carcinoma cells (Fig. 7B).
Spontaneous apoptosis of A-498 cells in the absence of CM
resulted in low levels of CK18-Asp396. Addition of CM from
CD56þ PBMC control cultures (CM-Co) enhanced A-498 cell
apoptosis (P ¼ 0.008; Fig. 7B). Moreover, CM from CD56þ
PBMCs stimulated with IL-2 (CM-IL-2) substantially increased
A-498 cell apoptosis compared with CM-Co (P ¼ 0.03). CM
from CD56þ PBMCs treated with mevastatin (CM-mev)
also enhanced tumor cell apoptosis compared with CM-Co
(P ¼ 0.01), suggesting that mevastatin directly induced tumor
cell apoptosis. However, compared with CM-IL-2 or CM-mev,
it significantly enhanced A-498 cell apoptosis when CM from
CD56þ PBMCs stimulated with statin plus IL-2, which contains high levels of IFN-g, was used (P ¼ 0.0008 and P ¼ 0.004,
respectively; Fig. 7B), indicating that soluble factors present in
CM cooperate to exhibit potent cytotoxic effects directed
against human renal carcinoma cells.
We therefore tested the direct effects of statin and recombinant IFN-g on human A-498 cells. Statin alone was capable
of inducing A-498 cell apoptosis (P ¼ 0.002), confirming that
statin present in CM directly acts on tumor cells (Fig. 7B). IFNg alone had little effect on tumor cell apoptosis (not shown).
However, the combination of statin and IFN-g resulted in
strong cytotoxicity (P ¼ 0.009; Fig. 7B).
To further establish the role of IFN-g in statin-induced
cytotoxicity, we used specific antibodies to neutralize natural
IFN-g and recombinant IFN-g. While CM from CD56þ PBMCs
stimulated with statin plus IL-2 caused serious damage to the
A-498 tumor cells, neutralization of IFN-g contained in these
CM resulted in the almost complete restoration of the tumor
cell monolayer (Fig. 7C, left), confirming the important role of
IFN-g in statin-mediated cytotoxicity. Likewise, statin and

To extend the relevance of the observed cytotoxic effects,
we used additional cancer cell lines. In MCF-7 cells, which are
a well-studied example of breast cancer, statin-induced
growth inhibition and cytotoxic effects have previously been
demonstrated (22, 23). Data shown in Supplementary Fig. S5
show that medium conditioned by CD56þ PBMCs treated with
statin plus IL-2 caused severe damage to the MCF-7 cells
(Supplementary Fig. S5A) and induced high levels of CK18Asp396, indicative of MCF-7 cell apoptosis (Supplementary

previously been shown to be IFN-g nonresponsive (25) due to a
lack of JAK1 gene expression (26).

Discussion
We show, for what we believe to be the first time,
potent stimulatory effects of statins on human NK cells.

Statin-Mediated NK Cell Activation via CD56þ Dendritic Cells

Statin-mediated NK cell activation depended on IL-2 costimulation and on the presence of CD56þCD14þ monocyte/DClike accessory cells (Supplementary Fig. S6). The observed
stimulatory effects were specific to the inhibition of protein
prenylation, as NK cell activation was completely reversible by
supplementation with GGPP (Fig. 3), the substrate of geranylgeranyl transferase, which catalyzes the covalent attachment of prenyl groups to proteins such as the Rho GTPases of
the RAS superfamily (2).
Our experiments with neutralizing antibodies revealed that
the IFN-g response induced by statin plus IL-2 was mediated
by endogenous IL-18 and IL-1b (Fig. 6), which are known to be
produced by myeloid APCs but not by NK cells, also indicating
that statins primarily acted on APCs. IL-18 alone is a poor
inducer of IFN-g production by NK cells (29); however, IL-18
synergizes with IL-2 to induce IFN-g production by NK cells in
vitro (38) and in vivo (39). IL-18 can induce IFN-g mRNA, but
secretion of its protein product requires costimulation with
IL-2 (40).
The effects of statins on NK cells reported so far were all
inhibitory (9–12). In all these studies, which focused on NK cell–
target cell interactions, purified NK cells were used in coculture
with target cells but the role of APCs had not been investigated
at all. We show here that in the presence of distinct APCs of the
monocyte/DC lineage, which share CD56 expression with NK
cells, statins induce IFN-g production in IL-2–activated NK cells,
resulting in considerable cytotoxicity (Fig. 7). We show that
statins directly acted on human carcinoma cells to induce
apoptosis and that IFN-g produced by NK cells cooperates with
statin to enhance tumor cell death (Fig. 7). These data clearly
indicated that statin and NK cell–derived IFN-g can cooperate to
exert potent antitumor activity (Fig. 7).
In the majority of animal tumor models, IFN-g was indispensable for tumor rejection (41, 42). In several of these
studies, neither perforin nor Fas ligand was found to be
essential for tumor rejection. In one study, adoptively transferred CD8þ effector T cells could reject tumors in an IFNg–dependent fashion despite multiple cytolytic defects (43). In
a recent study, chemotherapy was shown to make tumor cells
more susceptible to the cytotoxic effects of CTLs (44). Chemotherapy induced a perforin-independent dramatic increase
in permeability to CTL-derived granzyme B also resulting in a
spreading of cytotoxicity to neighboring tumor cells. Similarly,
our present data demonstrate that statins can sensitize tumor
cells to cytotoxic effects of NK cell–derived IFN-g (Fig. 7), thus
generating a potent antitumor mechanism that is perforin
independent and does not even require cell-to-cell contact
between effector cells and tumor cells.
We and others have previously described CD56þ monocyte/
DC-like cells (13–15), which share properties of monocytes and

of DCs (Supplementary Fig. S2). The ability of CD56þ monocyte/DC-like cells both to induce an allogeneic MLR (14) and to
activate gd T cells (13) as well as NK cells (Fig. 4) suggested that
these APCs may already have DC-like properties and may
further differentiate toward mature DCs during culture (Supplementary Fig. S2). Recently, CD56 expression has also been
detected on monocyte-derived DCs generated in the presence
of type 1 IFN and granulocyte macrophage–colony stimulating
factor (45), suggesting that the CD56þCD14þ monocyte/DClike cells described here represent the in vivo counterpart of the
CD56þ monocyte–derived IFN DCs (45).
In side-by-side analyses, we found that BDCA-1þ (CD1cþ)
myeloid DCs (32) could also serve as accessory cells in statininduced NK cell activation, although they were slightly less
potent than the CD56þCD14þ monocyte/DC-like cells
(Fig. 5A). Control stainings of BDCA-1þ DCs unexpectedly
revealed that they partially expressed CD56 (Fig. 5B), which
may explain their capacity to mediate NK cell activation.
Among CD14þ cells, only CD56þ monocyte/DC-like cells
could effectively mediate statin-induced NK cell activation
whereas conventional peripheral blood monocytes, which lack
CD56, were rather ineffective (Fig. 5A).
Collectively, these observations suggest that CD56þ monocyte/DC-like cells preferentially mediate NK cell activation in
response to statins. Together with our recent work on gd T
cells (13), the present data also suggest that CD56þ DC-like
cells may be particularly effective at inducing innate lymphocyte activation, a property that may be harnessed for cancer
immunotherapy.
