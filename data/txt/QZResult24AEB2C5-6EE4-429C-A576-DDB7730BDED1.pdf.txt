BACKGROUND: The months immediately after the completion of treatment for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) are often regarded as a stressful time for children and families. In this prospective, longitudinal study, the prevalence and predictors of anxiety and depressive symptoms after the completion of treatment were examined. METHODS: Participants included 160 children aged
2 to 9 years with standard-risk ALL who were enrolled on Children’s Oncology Group protocol AALL0331. Parents completed standardized rating scales of their children’s emotional-behavioral functioning and measures of coping and family functioning at approximately 1 month, 6 months, and 12 months after diagnosis and again 3 months after the completion of chemotherapy. RESULTS: At 3
months off therapy, approximately 24% of survivors had at-risk/clinically elevated anxiety scores and 28% had elevated depression
scores, which are significantly higher than the expected 15% in the general population (P 5 .028 and .001, respectively). Patients with
elevated anxiety 1 month after diagnosis were at greater risk of off-therapy anxiety (odds ratio, 4.1; 95% confidence interval, 1.31-12.73
[P 5 .022]) and those with elevated depressive symptoms 6 months after diagnosis were at greater risk of off-therapy depression
(odds ratio, 7.88; 95% confidence interval, 2.61-23.81 [P 5 .0002]). In adjusted longitudinal analyses, unhealthy family functioning (P 5
.008) and less reliance on social support coping (P 5 .009) were found to be associated with risk of emotional distress. Children from
Spanish-speaking families (P 5 .05) also were found to be at a greater risk of distress. CONCLUSIONS: A significant percentage of
children experience emotional distress during and after therapy for ALL. These data provide a compelling rationale for targeted early

INTRODUCTION
Because the percentage of children surviving standard-risk acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is currently >90%,1 attention must be paid to how best to support survivors’ emotional well-being during therapy and after its completion. Chemotherapy for ALL may directly impact children’s emotional functioning because systemic corticosteroids, which are
essential components of successful treatment, have been linked to behavioral side effects.2,3 During active treatment with
corticosteroids, concerns regarding frequent mood swings, irritability, depression, and anxiety as well as problems with behavioral control and attention have been widely reported in patients with childhood cancer.3-5 Children also may experience changes in emotional-behavioral functioning due to painful procedures and frequent clinic visits that disrupt typical
age-appropriate activities.6
Debate exists regarding the prevalence of emotional-behavioral difficulties in children after treatment of leukemia.
Some studies have concluded that survivors of childhood ALL are similar to their peers with regard to their emotionalbehavioral functioning,7,8 whereas others observed that at least a subset of survivors continue to experience distress long after treatment has ended.9,10 These differences in findings may be due to heterogeneous leukemia subtypes, varying risk of

disease recurrence, differences in time elapsed since diagnosis, differences in the intensity of the treatment protocols and outcome measures used, and a paucity of
longitudinal studies.
Understanding risk factors for children’s emotionalbehavioral functioning after cancer treatment is important
for improving the identification of those at greatest risk of
future difficulties, and to elucidate possible avenues for
intervention. In a previous longitudinal investigation of
the first year of therapy, we reported that depression and
anxiety are significant problems in the immediate postdiagnosis period for children with standard-risk ALL.11
Although the prevalence of anxiety appeared to lessen after the first month of therapy, depressive symptoms persisted throughout the first year. With extended follow-up
of this same cohort, we are now able to examine emotional
functioning after treatment and determine whether this
pattern continues into the early off-therapy period.
The months immediately after the completion of
treatment have been described as one of the most difficult
and anxiety-producing periods for patients with cancer
and their families,12 presumably due to fear of disease recurrence and loss of clinical support. The possibility of
persistent neurobehavioral side effects from corticosteroids as well as posttraumatic stress also may contribute to
the emotional-behavioral functioning of survivors after
treatment, yet to our knowledge the incidence of such difficulties in young children during this important time has
not been well documented. The current study was
designed to determine the prevalence and predictors of
anxiety and depressive symptoms in survivors of childhood ALL at 3 months after the completion of treatment.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Participants

Participants were drawn from a large, representative sample of children with standard-risk ALL (ie, initial white
blood cell count <50,000/uL and aged 1.0-9.9 years with
no evidence of central nervous system or testicular leukemia, a rapid early response to therapy based on bone marrow morphology, and minimal residual disease at the end
of induction) who were enrolled on a Children’s Oncology Group therapeutic study (AALL0331; ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT00103285 [http://www.cancer.gov/
clinicaltrials]) between 2005 and 2009. This
chemotherapy-only protocol involved a 3-drug (vincristine, pegaspargase, and dexamethasone), 4-week induction therapy and intrathecal chemotherapy. The current
study consisted only of patients categorized and treated as

being at average risk. Therapeutic randomization consisted of standard consolidation versus an intensified consolidation that added 2 doses of cyclophosphamide and
pegaspargase. A second randomization that compared
standard interim maintenance with oral methotrexate versus augmented interim maintenance with escalating intravenous methotrexate was halted in 2008 based on results
of the Children’s Cancer Group-1991 Standard-Risk
ALL trial,13 which demonstrated better outcomes with intravenous methotrexate.
Emotional-behavioral outcomes were collected as
part of an ancillary study at 31 Children’s Oncology
Group sites that included community-based and tertiary
care centers. Additional eligibility for this ancillary study
included age 2 years and at least 1 parent with reading
comprehension in English or Spanish (to ensure survey
comprehension). Of 195 individuals who enrolled on
AALL0331 and met eligibility criteria for the current
study, 24 declined and 170 consented to participate. Of
those who consented, 4 individuals withdrew from
AALL0331 before the first survey evaluations and 6 individuals were not given surveys because of errors at study
sites.
Procedures

The Institutional Review Board of each participating center approved the protocol and study documents. Informed
consent, and assent if indicated, was obtained from all
participants in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. The identified primary caregiver (the child’s mother
in 84% of instances) was asked to complete all survey
measures at 4 specified timepoints: day 1 of consolidation
therapy (approximately 1 month after diagnosis; T1), the
end of the delayed intensification (approximately 6
months after diagnosis; T2), 6 months after the initiation
of maintenance therapy (approximately 12 months after
diagnosis; T3), and 3 months after the completion of therapy (approximately 33 months after diagnosis for females
and 45 months after diagnosis for males; T4).
Measures

Anxiety and depression were assessed using the Behavioral
Assessment System for Children-2nd Edition: Parent
Report Scale (BASC-2), a valid and reliable instrument
that has been used frequently in pediatric oncology studies.14,15 The BASC-2 scales are reported as standardized
T-scores (mean, 50; standard deviation, 10) based on the
age and sex of the child. Scores of 60 to 69 represent the
at-risk range and scores 70 represent the clinically significant range. The BASC-2 has been standardized on
1609

Original Article

normative data obtained from a large, representative sample of children living in the United States (12,350 children), including Spanish-speaking children and parents
who completed the Spanish BASC-2 form.16 From this
standardization sample, expected frequencies of elevated
scores are available. Although anxiety and depression
scales were the primary outcomes of interest, aggression
and hyperactivity scales also were examined.
Family functioning was measured using the General
Functioning scale of the Family Assessment Device
(FAD-GF).17,18 Parents were asked to indicate the degree
to which each statement described their family (eg, “We
are able to make decisions about how to solve problems”)
on a scale of 1 to 4. Scores 2 reflect unhealthy family
functioning.17
Parental coping behaviors were assessed by the Coping Health Inventory for Parents (CHIP).19 This checklist
comprises 3 scales (1) maintaining family integration/optimism; 2) maintaining social support/self-esteem; and 3)
understanding the medical situation) and has been validated for children with chronic illnesses. Parents rated
how helpful specific coping behaviors were on a 4-point
scale ranging from “not helpful” to “extremely helpful.”
Higher scores reflect greater reliance on that particular
coping pattern.
Physical symptoms of pain and hurt and nausea
were assessed by subscales of the Pediatric Quality of Life
Inventory (PedsQL) 3.0 Cancer Module.20 Parents rated
how much of a problem each symptom has been within
the past month. Scores were transformed on a scale of 0
(worst health) to 100 (best health).
Sociodemographic characteristics were obtained via
parent survey, including questions regarding ethnicity,
primary language spoken at home, household income,
marital status, maternal education, and family size.
Statistical Analysis

Data were analyzed using SAS statistical software (version
9.3; SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC). Descriptive statistics
were calculated to characterize sample composition. Of
160 participants, 140, 127, 134, and 96, respectively,
completed evaluations at T1, T2, T3, and T4. The chisquare exact test and Kruskal-Wallis test were used to
compare participants with complete evaluations at 3
months after the completion of treatment (T4) with those
who did not complete the T4 measurement.
Primary outcomes were BASC-2 anxiety and depression scales at T4. The percentages of patients with elevated scores (ie, those in the “at least at-risk” and
“clinical” ranges) were compared with the corresponding
1610

percentages expected within the normative population of
healthy children using a 2-sided binomial exact test.
Logistic regression analysis was used to examine elevations
in anxiety and depression while receiving therapy (ie, at
T1, T2, and T3) as predictors of elevated anxiety
and depression scores after the completion of treatment
(T4).
To examine the contribution of demographic, treatment, and family factors to distress after treatment (ie,
anxiety, depression, and mixed anxiety and depression
symptoms), univariate and multivariate longitudinal analyses were conducted. Multinomial logistic regression
models with 4 categories of the dependent-variable
BASC-2 elevated T-score (ie, “only anxiety elevated,”
“only depression elevated,” and “both anxiety and depression elevated” compared with the reference group [“no
elevations; neither depression nor anxiety elevated”]) were
used, taking into consideration the dependence of
repeated measurements at the 4 timepoints for each participant. The following independent variables were analyzed: age at diagnosis, sex, race and ethnicity, caregiver’s
age, household income, maternal education, marital status, the presence of a neurological event on therapy, and
pain and hurt subscales, as well as repeated measures of
general family functioning and coping behaviors. Child
and family factors that were found to be at least marginally associated with elevated anxiety and depression scores
(ie, P.1) on univariate analysis were included in corresponding multivariate analysis.
RESULTS
Demographic Characteristics

Sociodemographic and treatment characteristics are presented in Table 1. At the time of the final assessment (T4,
3 months after the completion of chemotherapy),
approximately 60% of the initial participants completed
survey measurements. When participants with complete
data at T4 were compared with those with missing data,
there were no differences noted with regard to key sociodemographic or treatment factors, with the exception of
sex. Specifically, boys were less likely to have complete
emotional-behavioral measures at T4 than girls. This
may be due to differences in treatment duration between
males and females, with males requiring a longer treatment period. There were no significant differences noted
in T1 levels of anxiety, depression, pain and nausea, or
coping behaviors between participants with complete
data at the final assessment and those with missing data
(P>.05).

Prevalence of Emotional-Behavioral Problems

Mean scores for anxiety and depression were within the
average range across all timepoints. However, after the
completion of chemotherapy, the frequency of at-risk or
clinically significant anxiety and depression scores was
greater than the frequency expected based on the normative population of children (15%). Specifically, approximately 24% of survivors demonstrated at-risk or clinically
significant elevations in anxiety (P 5 .028) and 29% displayed clinically significant elevations in depression (P 5
.001) at T4. Longitudinal patterns of the percentage of
children with elevated anxiety and depression scores are
shown in Figure 1. As shown, rates of at-risk or clinically
significant anxiety scores appeared to decrease over the
first year (25.2% at T1, 17.5% at T2, and 14.2% at T3),
but increased at T4 to a rate similar to that observed early
in treatment (24%). The frequency of anxiety scores
within the more severe category of “clinically significant”
also decreased over the first year of treatment, and
appeared to increase slightly at T4. However, the prevalence of anxiety scores in the “clinically significant” range
at T4 was not statistically different from expectations
based on normative population data (6.3% vs 4%;
P 5 .37).
The prevalence of elevated depression scores
remained fairly consistent across cancer treatment (21.7%

at T1, 28.6% at T2, and 21.1% at T3) and into the posttreatment period (28.7% at T4), which was significantly
higher than expected compared with the normative population (all P<.05). The frequency of more severe depression scores (ie, within the “clinically significant” range)
was not statistically different from the expected levels at
any timepoint during or after therapy.
Because distress in children commonly presents as
comorbid anxiety-depression symptoms,21 the percentage
of children with elevations on both the anxiety and
depression scales was examined at each of the 4 timepoints. The prevalence of those with at-risk/clinically significant elevations on both the anxiety and depression
scales decreased by 12 months after diagnosis (13% at T1,
15% at T2, and 8% at T3), and increased again after the
completion of therapy (12% at T4). The frequency of elevations on scales sampling aggression and hyperactivity
were consistent with rates expected in the general population across all 4 timepoints (data not shown).

support coping behaviors (P 5 .009) and primary language spoken at home (P 5 .047) remained significant
predictors of mixed symptoms of anxiety and depression
such that children from Spanish-speaking homes were
more likely to have at-risk/clinically significant elevations
on both the anxiety and depression scales. Significant predictors of at-risk/clinically elevated depression only from
multivariate analyses included unhealthy family functioning (P 5 .008).
DISCUSSION
In the current multisite, prospective, longitudinal study of
children with standard-risk ALL, we sought to determine
the prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms at 3
months after the completion of chemotherapy. Although
the majority of parents described their child’s emotionalbehavioral functioning as consistent with population
norms, a significant percentage of the cohort reported elevated depression and anxiety in the at-risk/clinically significant range at frequencies > the 15% expected in the
general population (28% and 24%, respectively). When
data were examined longitudinally, the prevalence of elevated anxiety appeared to decrease over the first year but
increased again after the completion of therapy to a level
similar to that observed near the time of diagnosis. The
frequency of elevated depressive symptoms was significant
across all 4 timepoints when compared with expectations
in the general population.
The results of the current investigation are in contrast to a prior longitudinal study of the emotional-behav1614

ioral functioning of childhood ALL survivors which
found internalizing symptoms to normalize after the completion of therapy22 and some cross-sectional studies that
have suggested that survivor’s emotional-behavioral functioning after treatment is similar to their peers.8,23 Other
studies similar to the current study have found that emotional distress continues to be an important issue for a
subset of survivors at the end of therapy.24 Our longitudinal findings suggest that a substantial percentage of survivors of childhood ALL experience persistent mood
difficulties throughout cancer treatment and into survivorship, and heightened anxiety at the time of diagnosis
and again during the initial off-treatment phase.
An important finding in the current study was that
children with elevated depression and anxiety early in
therapy were at a significantly increased risk of persistent
distress after the completion of treatment: that is, children
with elevated anxiety scores at the initiation of consolidation therapy were 4 times more likely to have elevated anxiety scores after treatment, and children with elevated
depression scores at 6 months after diagnosis were 8 times
more likely to have elevated depression after treatment.
Given this, the rapid identification of anxiety and depressive symptoms and effective interventions directed toward
children who exhibit distress (eg, mindfulness-based stress
reduction, cognitive behavioral therapeutic approaches)
early in the course of treatment may help to mitigate longterm emotional distress. Psychologists and social workers
are well-versed in such techniques, and at some hospitals
these therapies can be delivered alongside medical care,

particularly when psychosocial team members are embedded within oncology, and introduced early in treatment as
part of the standard of care.
In adjusted analyses, children of Spanish-speaking
families were nearly 11 times more likely to have elevations on both the anxiety and depression scales than children from homes in which English is the primary
language. Although the Spanish BASC-2 is a validated
and widely accepted tool for measuring the mood/behavior of children from Spanish-speaking families, it is possible that this finding may reflect subtle differences in the
measurement of these constructs due to the translation of
items and/or cultural differences in the way items were
perceived. To the best of our knowledge, few studies to
date have examined the emotional functioning of minority cancer survivors from Spanish-speaking families. One
cross-sectional study of survivors of childhood cancer in a
long-term follow-up clinic25 found poorer psychosocial
quality of life among Hispanic children after the completion of treatment compared with non-Hispanic survivors.
Another study found a higher prevalence of posttraumatic
stress and depression in Hispanic parents of survivors of
childhood cancer, even after adjusting for other sociodemographic differences.25 Generally, the use of mental
health care is lower among Hispanics, and differences in
access and attitudes toward mental health care may contribute to this.26 Language and acculturation issues may
be barriers to seeking out and receiving psychological support during and after cancer treatment and may contribute to anxiety.27
Risk factors for distress (ie, combined depressionanxiety symptoms) also included less reliance on social
support coping behaviors. Unhealthy family functioning
was found to be strongly associated with the risk of elevated depression symptoms, and marginally associated
with the risk of combined anxiety-depression symptoms.
Family functioning has been previously linked to children’s emotional well-being in healthy children28 and in
children with chronic medical illness29 and injury.30
Interventions to support family functioning and improve
coping skills (eg, maternal problem-solving skills training,31 family systems approaches) also have the potential
to improve mood.32 Age, sex, socioeconomic status, and
therapeutic randomization did not appear to be predictive
of depression or anxiety symptoms. Similar to other studies, the prevalence of aggression and hyperactivity did not
differ from expectations based on population norms.
The strengths of the current study include a high
participation rate (82% of those eligible) and a representative Hispanic/Spanish-speaking sample that we believe

has been understudied to date. The treatment protocols
examined represent current regimens for ALL, and the
longitudinal study design allowed us to examine early predictors of distress after the completion of therapy. However, the current study also had limitations. Given the
participants’ young age, only parent proxy reports were
used. Although this is an accepted method for measuring
emotional functioning in young children, parent ratings
may be influenced by their own stress and worry, which
was not specifically examined. Attrition also was noted
over the duration of the study. However, when participants with complete T4 data were compared with those
with missing data, they differed only with respect to sex
(ie, fewer boys with complete T4 data), most likely due to
the longer treatment period required of males. There were
no differences noted with regard to T1 anxiety, depression, pain and nausea, or coping behaviors between participants with complete and those with missing T4 data.
The results of the current study found a statistically
higher prevalence of elevated anxiety and depression
scores in the at least “at-risk” range, but not in the more
severe “clinically significant” range after the completion
of treatment. This may reflect that emotional distress was
present in the current study sample, but at the more moderate end of the spectrum in terms of severity. An alternative explanation could be inadequate sample size. Higher
frequencies of “clinically significant” anxiety and depression scores were observed at all timepoints in comparison
with expectations in the general population, although
these did not often reach statistical significance. Although
the BASC-2 is appropriate for screening, it is not sufficient for diagnosis, and it is likely that a smaller percentage of the sample in the current study would have met
diagnostic criteria for anxiety/depression at the time of
clinical interview. The level of functional impairment
associated with symptoms reported in the current study
also is not known. Nonetheless, previous studies have
found distress to be associated with suffering and poor
health outcomes, leading many to call for the inclusion of
screening and/or interventions to mitigate distress into
the standard of care.33,34 The early identification of children who are at risk of distress after cancer may allow for
more rapid interventions to alleviate psychological symptoms, foster adaptive family functioning/coping, and prevent symptom escalation or persistent distress.
A significant percentage of survivors of childhood
ALL experience persistent anxiety and depression symptoms after the completion of treatment. Routine screening
for distress, and assessment of parental coping styles and
general family functioning are important ways with which

to identify children and families who may need a higher
level of psychosocial care, including comprehensive evaluation and targeted support during/after treatment. Brief surveys such as the Psychosocial Assessment Tool 2.035
(which taps family functioning/coping) or the Distress
Thermometer36 (modeled after pain scales) may be useful
in identifying children at risk, and can be administered in
<5 minutes by a social worker, nurse, or other professional
during clinic visits. The timing of screening should, at minimum, occur when patients are at greatest risk of distress
(ie, near the initiation of treatment, at transitions during
treatment, and soon after completing treatment). Children
from Spanish-speaking households also are at risk of distress after the completion of treatment and represent a
group that warrants culturally sensitive screening and interventions. Although there are promising interventions to
mitigate distress in children with chronic illness, to the best
of our knowledge few have been empirically tested in survivors of childhood cancer and little information exists
regarding when in the course of cancer treatment is the best
time to intervene. The efficacy and timing of psychological
interventions for children to reduce the risk of symptoms
of anxiety and depression after ALL is an important topic,
and further research is necessary to determine the best pathways to mitigate distress and support the emotional wellbeing of children and families as they enter the offtreatment period.
