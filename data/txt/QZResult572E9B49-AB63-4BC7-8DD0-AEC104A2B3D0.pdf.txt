Abstract
Epigenetic therapy for solid tumors could benefit from an in vivo model that defines tumor characteristics of
responsiveness and resistance to facilitate patient selection. Here we report that combining the histone
deacetylase inhibitor entinostat with the demethylating agent vidaza profoundly affected growth of K-ras/
p53 mutant lung adenocarcinomas engrafted orthotopically in immunocompromised nude rats by targeting and
ablating pleomorphic cells that occupied up to 75% of the tumor masses. A similar reduction in tumor burden
was seen with epigenetic therapy in K-ras or EGFR mutant tumors growing orthotopically. Increased expression
of proapoptotic genes and the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 was seen. Hundreds of genes were
demethylated highlighted by the reexpression of polycomb-regulated genes coding for transcription factor
binding proteins and the p16 gene, a key regulator of the cell cycle. Highly significant gene expression changes
were seen in key regulatory pathways involved in cell cycle, DNA damage, apoptosis, and tissue remodeling.
These findings show the promise for epigenetic therapy in cancer management and provide an orthotopic lung
cancer model that can assess therapeutic efficacy and reprogramming of the epigenome in tumors harboring
different genetic and epigenetic profiles to guide use of these drugs. Cancer Res; 71(2); 454–62. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death in
the United States and will soon reach epidemic levels (1). The
minimal efficacy of conventional chemotherapy has prompted
a renewed focus on targeted therapy based on pathways
altered during the pathogenesis of lung cancer. Two targets
being exploited are the epidermal growth factor receptor
family and vascular endothelial growth factor (2–6). Although
some patients have shown dramatic and sustained response
to these therapies, overall response and survival advantage for
non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients in phase III trials
have been modest, albeit statistically significant (2–6). Unfortunately, even preselecting patients based on dysfunction
within the targeted pathway is unlikely to yield sustained

response in most cases due to the molecular heterogeneity of
lung tumors (7).
The silencing of genes through promoter hypermethylation
is a major and causal epigenetic event that occurs during lung
cancer initiation and progression and affects the function of
hundreds of genes. Gene silencing involves methylation of
cytosines in the gene promoter region, recruitment of transcriptional corepressors, and modification of histone tails that
culminate in the establishment of chromatin modifications
that block transcription (8, 9). Cytosine methylation seems
dominant in transcriptional repression, and inhibitors of the
cytosine DNA-methyltransferases, vidaza [5-azacytidine (5Aza)], and decitabine [5-deoxy azacytidine (DAC)] can induce
in vitro reexpression of genes silenced through promoter
hypermethylation (8, 9). Importantly, although inhibitors of
histone deacetylation (HDAC) are not very effective in inducing reexpression of genes silenced by promoter hypermethylation, such inhibitors can synergize with demethylating
agents to relieve transcriptional repression (10). Thus, the
reversal of gene silencing by pharmacologic agents may offer
an effective strategy for primary and adjuvant cancer therapy.
Rather than targeting single pathway alterations in cancer,
epigenetic therapy may circumvent the problem of tumor
heterogeneity by inducing the reexpression of multiple tumorsuppressor genes essential for abrogating cancer cell survival
and proliferation. The initial history of demethylating agents
suggested they were too toxic and not efficacious as cancer
cytotoxic agents. However, as a result of laboratory findings,

Targeting the Epigenome for Therapy

these drugs were reassessed and proved to be a potent therapy
for myelodyplasia, a precursor state to acute myelogenous
leukemia, when used at doses much lower than the maximum
tolerated dose leading to the approval of these drugs by the
FDA for the treatment of these diseases (11). Clinical trials
with DNA demethylating agents combined with HDAC inhibitors are showing promising responses in the treatment of
myeloid malignancies (12). The extension of this targeted
approach to solid tumors including lung also may hold
promise as a therapy. Our work in which combined treatment
with DAC and sodium phenylbutyrate reduced the number of
developing lung tumors in a murine model by greater than
50% supports this supposition (13).
The expansion of epigenetic therapy in the clinic makes it
critical to define tumor characteristics that will be most
responsive or resistant to epigenetic therapy in order to better
select patients with the highest potential to respond. This is a
challenge in clinical trials where access to tumor tissue preand posttherapy is uncommon. We have developed an orthotopic lung cancer model in which xenografts of human lung
cancer–derived cell lines are efficiently engrafted throughout
the lungs of the Rowett nude rat (14). The purpose of this
study was to determine the efficacy of a demethylating agent
alone or in combination with an HDAC inhibitor on the
growth of tumors engrafted in the lungs of the nude rat
and on reprogramming of the epigenome.

Materials and Methods
Tumor cell implantation and treatment
Male Rowett nude rats (Cr:NIH-ru), 8–10 weeks old, were
obtained from Frederick Cancer Research and Development.
Calu-6, A549, and H1975 cells obtained from American Type
Culture Collection were cultured and instilled via orotracheal
intubation as described (14). Rats (n ¼ 20/group) were treated
with vehicle [saline or DMSO (10 each)], 5-Aza [Sigma (2 mg/
kg, dissolved in saline)], or entinostat [MS-275, gift from
Syndax Pharmaceutical (1 mg/kg, dissolved in DMSO)] by
intraperitoneal injection.
Tissue collection, estimation of tumor volume, and
photomicroscopy
Prior to sacrifice, 4 animals from each treatment group were
randomly selected for collection of tumors for molecular
assays. Five tumors were collected from each animal with
exception of 1 rat treated with combination therapy that had
no tumors (instillation likely missed the trachea). After weighing the remaining lungs, they were inflated with 10% neutralbuffered formalin at a constant hydrostatic pressure of 25 cm
for 6 hours. Lung volume (VL) was determined by fluid
displacement. Lung lobes were trimmed at 3- to 4-mm intervals in a direction perpendicular to the axial airways with the
first slice placed randomly near the cranial and/or hilar end.
Paraffin-embedded lungs were sectioned at 5-mm thickness
and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Approximately 30
histology sections were generated per set of lung lobes. For
measurement of tumor size, a mylar morphometry grid with
points spaced 1 mm apart was overlaid upon each of the

www.aacrjournals.org

microscope slides. The total area of the lung sections and the
area occupied by tumor were estimated by counting points
overlying tissue (15). An estimate of total tumor volume was
determined by the percentage of tissue points overlying tumor
multiplied by the VL.
Gross pathology images from a PowerShot S3IS digital
camera (Canon) were processed with Adobe Photoshop CS3
(v. 10.0.1; Adobe Systems, Inc.). Contrast was adjusted to þ50;
images were cropped, rotated, and resized. Measurement bars
of 4-mm length were added with the line tool of Photoshop.
Photomicrographs were made using Olympus equipment and
software (BX41 with UPlanFL objectives, DP25 camera; Olympus America, Inc.). Automatic exposure settings were used,
contrast was adjusted to þ50, images were resized, and image
magnification was indicated using measurement bars of
known length.
Gene expression and protein analysis
RNA was isolated following TRI-reagent (Sigma) instructions. Total RNA (1 mg) was reverse transcribed using the High
Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufactures protocol. RT-qPCR was
carried out with the ABI PRISM 7900HT and inventoried
TaqMan assays (Applied Biosystems). Experiments were normalized to GAPDH. Results were repeated in 3 separate
experiments. Data were analyzed with respect to a calibrator
sample using the 2DDCt method and reported as relative
quantity (RQ). DNMT1 protein levels were quantified by
Western blot as described (16).
Gene methylation and expression profiling
Bisulfite modified DNA isolated from vehicle, 5-Aza, or 5Aza þ MS-275–treated Calu-6 tumors were hybridized to the
Methylation Promoter27 Beadchip (Illumina, Inc.). Calu-6
DNA treated with SSS1 methylase that converts all CpGs to
5-methylcytosine was included on the array to define signal
intensity for each probe and bisulfite modified DNA from
normal bronchial epithelial cells was also included to identify
genes methylated in normal cells. Average signal intensity
between the methylated and unmethylated probes was determined, and a b-value from 0–1 (fully methylated) was calculated. B-values 0.45 or greater were scored as positive for
methylation in vehicle-treated tumors and a reduction in
b-value of 20% or greater for a methylated gene was scored
as demethylation. Total RNA isolated from the tumors interrogated by the Methylation Promoter27 Beadchip were hybridized to Agilent 41K expression arrays using a standardized
protocol to identify changes in gene expression.
Statistical analyses
The 2-sample t test and analysis of variance were used to
compare the 2 treatment groups and the 2 groups with the
vehicle, respectively. To check appropriateness of the statistical methods, analyses were rerun with transformed data if
appropriate or using the Kruskal–Wallis test. When multiple
tumors per rat were used, mixed-effects models with a random effect for rat were used. Microarray data were background corrected and analyzed using the linear model analysis

Bioconductor package "limma" that generated mRNA levels
and measures of significance. The limma output for each
tumor was used for analysis with Metacore (GeneGo Inc.)
to identify the functional pathways and networks statistically
over represented in the set of changed genes. Only genes
increasing or decreasing at least 1.5-fold in 2 or more tumors
for each treatment were included in the analysis. The raw data
of the microarray analysis have been deposited in the GEO
database (GSE24732). Analyses were done with SAS9.2 unless
otherwise indicated.

Results
Epigenetic therapy reduces tumor burden and targets
poorly differentiated tumor cells
The Calu-6 cell line, established from an adenocarcinoma,
was selected for these studies because it contains mutant Kras and p53 genes, a genetic profile common to NSCLC (17).
Our group has also validated through methylation-specific
PCR (MSP) and bisulfite sequencing that 44 genes, most
notably p16, are silenced through promoter methylation in
this cell line (18, 19).
A dose of 2.0 mg/kg 5-Aza was used, as it was well tolerated
in pilot studies (no systemic toxicity) and approximates the
human dose of 40 mg/m2 used in a phase I/II clinical trial for
advanced lung cancer (Juergens, unpublished data). The dose
selected for the HDAC inhibitor MS-275 (1.0 mg/kg) has been
used in animal studies and is within the range being tested in
human clinical trials (20, 21). Three groups (n ¼ 20/group)
vehicle, 5-Aza, and 5-Aza þ MS-275, comprised this efficacy
study. MS-275 was not tested alone due to the lack of effectiveness of HDAC inhibitors on murine lung tumor growth and
reexpression of methylated genes (10, 13). In addition, no
objective responses were seen in lung cancer patients treated
with the HDAC inhibitor Romidepsin (22). An additional 6 rats
that did not receive tumor cells were included to determine
tumor-free lung weights for comparison with treatment
groups. The dose schedule selected was 4 consecutive days
of treatment with 5-Aza followed with vehicle or MS-275 on
day 5 for 4 consecutive weeks. This dosing schedule was
selected because HDAC inhibitors can cause cell cycle arrest
and if given during 5-Aza treatment could reduce the maximal

demethylation response (20). Treatment was initiated 3 weeks
after instillation of tumor cells, a time point at which small
nodules are scattered throughout the lung parenchyma (14).
Without intervention, these nodules grow to coalesce and
form large masses that efface greater than 75% of the parenchyma at 9 weeks postinstillation.
Tumor burden was quantified 7 weeks following instillation
of Calu-6 cells as the change in normal lung weight compared
with tumor bearing lung weights. The sample sizes are
reduced slightly due to exclusion of animals with no evidence
of tumors that occurs when instillation through the orotracheal intubation presumably misses the trachea resulting in
placement into the esophagus instead. In addition, 2 rats were
terminated early due to infection unrelated to treatment. Rats
that remained in the study showed an 18%–22% increase in
body weight over the 4 weeks, irrespective of treatment.
Treatment with 5-Aza significantly reduced tumor burden
by 31%, whereas the combination of 5-Aza þ MS-275 had a
dramatic effect, reducing tumor burden by 60% (Table 1).
Smaller tumor burden was manifested as a reduction in lung
weight that in turn was highly correlated with estimates of
tumor volume [r ¼ 0.95, P < 0.0001 (n ¼ 14–19/group)]. The
dramatic difference in tumor burden and volume can be seen
in the photographs of the dorsal aspects of the lungs from a
vehicle and 5-Aza þ MS-275–treated rat [Fig. 1A (a, b)]. This
finding was replicated in A549 (K-ras mutant) and H1975
(EGFR mutant) tumors growing orthotopically in which tumor
burden was reduced by 40% and 53%, respectively (P < 0.001; n
¼ 20/group) with combination therapy (not shown).
All subsequent histopathology and molecular characterization was focused on the Calu-6 tumors. Histopathology findings in vehicle-treated animals revealed large, coalesced
masses that occupied up to 50% of the parenchyma within
sections of the lung and were often located near bronchioloalveolar duct junctions [Fig. 1B (a, b)]. The masses were
composed of 2 morphologically distinct cell populations. One
population was composed of well-differentiated mucus secreting adenocarcinoma cells with abundant and finely vacuolated cytoplasm. Tubule lumens and remnants of alveolar
airspace were often filled with mucinous material. Occasional
nuclear and cytolytic fragments were scattered among these
cells along with infiltrates of neutrophils and rare mitotic

cytoplasm and indistinct cell margins. Mitotic activity in these
foci was high (up to 10 mitotic figures per 40 field) along
with apoptosis and liquefactive necrosis within the centers of
the cell nests. Tumor mass was greatly reduced in lungs
treated with 5-Aza alone or in combination with MS-275
corroborating results from assessment of overall tumor burden and volume. Epigenetic therapy largely ablated the pleomorphic cell population (<5% of the residual tumor) with a
portion of the well-differentiated tumor cells remaining
[Fig. 1B (c–f)]. Mitotic activity was reduced by approximately
50% in the lung tumors from 5-Aza-treated animals and was
rare in animals receiving the combination therapy. Only mild
inflammation similar to untreated lungs was seen with the
epigenetic therapy.

Epigenetic therapy increases expression of
proapoptotic genes and p21
Tumors were collected from lungs of rats treated with
vehicle, 5-Aza, or 5-Aza þ MS-275 for molecular assays.
Expression of the proapoptotic genes Bad, Bak, and Bok were
increased up to 3-fold in tumors, irrespective of treatment.
The magnitude of expression of these genes was similar within
a tumor, but varied across tumors within and between lungs
from treated animals (Fig. 2A). The largest increase in expression was seen for Bik, a major proapoptotic gene in lung
epithelial cells (23), and this was greater with combined
treatment than 5-Aza alone (3.9 vs. 2.6-fold on average, P <
0.001; Fig. 2A). The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21
(WAF1) functions as a regulator of cell cycle progression
and senescence and is induced by HDAC inhibitors that
include MS-275 (24). The expression of p21 was increased
1.6– to 3.1-fold and 2.0- to 5.5-fold in tumors from animals
treated with 5-Aza or combined treatment, respectively. Overall, the increase in p21 expression was significantly greater in
tumors treated with 5-Aza þ MS-275 versus 5-Aza [2.8-fold
(n ¼ 20) vs. 2.0-fold (n ¼ 15) on average, P < 0.01; Fig. 2B].
Inhibition of cytosine DNA-methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1)
and reprogramming of the epigenome
The effect of epigenetic therapy on expression of p16INK4a
(p16) whose CpG island is densely methylated leading to
complete loss of expression in Calu-6 tumors was used to
initially evaluate response to therapy. Considerable heterogeneity within and across animals was seen for reexpression of
p16 that ranged from 1.5-– to 50-fold and did not differ
significantly between treatment groups (Fig. 3A). Bisulfite
sequencing of the p16 CpG island in 4 tumors randomly
selected from each treatment group, revealed average
demethylation of 5%–45% across the 27 CpGs interrogated
(Fig. 3B) that in turn correlated with increased gene expression
(r ¼ 0.72; P ¼ 0.04). Finally, DNMT1 protein levels were reduced
by approximately 60%, irrespective of treatment (Fig. 3C).
Studies were extended in these 8 treated tumors and 4
vehicle tumors to address the effect of epigenetic therapy
on global reprogramming of the epigenome. Bisulfite modified
DNA was hybridized to the Methylation27 Beadchip that
interrogates 27,600 CpG sites spanning promoter regions of
more than 14,000 genes. The number of methylated genes in

vehicle-treated tumors varied by less than 1% with 1,914 genes
methylated in all tumors. Demethylation of 20% or greater was
seen for 302–988 and 395–1,065 genes in tumors treated with
5-Aza and 5-Aza þ MS-275, respectively (Fig. 4A). Differences
in the number of demethylated genes were evident across
tumors and within animals. The number of genes not methylated across tumors is also shown (Supplementary Fig. S1). A

Targeting the Epigenome for Therapy

tumors and normalized to b-actin in 4 tumors each (animal number  tumor number) from animals treated with 5-Aza or 5-Aza þ MS-275 is shown.

reexpression of these genes and p16 is due to the fact that p16
expression was not detected, whereas low levels of expression
was seen for the other genes in vehicle tumors.
The histone methyltransferase EZH2 is a member of the
Polycomb group (PcG) of proteins and catalyzes the trimethylation at Lysine27 of histone H3 (H3K27me3). Methylated K27
along with EZH2, EED, and SUZ12 comprise the PRC2 complex
that contributes to the formation of a repressive chromatin
state. This PRC2 complex can also recruit the DNMTs
(DNMT1, 3a, and 3b) and thus, may play an important role
in tumor-specific targeting of de novo methylation at specific
gene promoters (25–27). Stem cells rely on PcG proteins to
reversibly repress genes encoding transcription factors
required for differentiation (28). Several recent studies support the hypothesis of a stem cell signature in cancer in which
differentiated cells undergoing transformation reacquire stem
cell characteristics through a process of dedifferentiation
thereby acquiring the H3K27me3 mark and de novo cytosine
methylation (29, 30). Probe sets for 1,472 PRC2 target genes are
annotated on the Methylation27 Beadchip and 503 (34%) of
these genes were methylated in Calu-6 tumors. Thus, PRC2
target genes account for 25% of the genes positive for methylation in this cell line. Moreover, these genes were readily
demethylated by both treatments (Fig. 4C). Eighty-four of
these genes coded for transcription factors. Interestingly,
unsupervised cluster analysis of the 258 PRC2 target genes
that were demethylated revealed 4 distinct clusters. The 95
genes found in cluster 2 had a much greater extent of
demethylation with the combined therapy compared with
treatment with 5-Aza alone (Fig. 4D, Supplementary
Table S1). Thirty-five of these genes code for transcription
factor binding proteins (e.g., FOX, HOX gene families) and their
extent of demethylation was significantly greater in tumors
exposed to combined versus single therapy (29%  1% vs. 9%
 1%, respectively; P < 2  1016). In addition, expression of
EZH2 was reduced 55% and 40% in tumors exposed to
combined versus single therapy, respectively (Fig. 5).

Epigenetic therapy reprograms major cancer
signaling pathways
Malignant transformation involves the disruption of many
pathways within the cell. Metacore analysis of Agilent expression arrays generated from vehicle and the 8 tumors interrogated on the Methylation27 Beadchip was used to identify
the major pathways modulated by epigenetic therapy. The
most significant changes were seen in expression of genes
within the cell cycle, DNA damage, apoptosis, and tissue
remodeling (Fig. 6A, Supplementary Table S2). Other key cell
functions altered were inflammatory and immune response,
cell differentiation, and angiogenesis. The effect on expression
of genes within the cell cycle and apoptotic pathways was
greater with the combined therapy. Genes altered in the core
cell cycle by single and combined therapy (Fig. 6B, Supplementary Table S2) included reduced expression of cyclin and
cyclin dependent kinase (cdk) gene families along with
increased expression of p16 and p21 as validated by TaqMan
assays. Expression of the minichromosome maintenance
(MCM) genes involved in the initiation and elongation phases
of DNA replication, Aurora A-kinase that regulates chromosome segregation and cytokinesis and Survivin, a regulator of
mitosis and apoptosis, were all reduced (Fig. 6B; refs. 31–33).

Discussion
These studies show that epigenetic therapy can profoundly
affect the growth of lung adenocarcinomas engrafted in the
lungs of the nude rat by reprogramming the epigenome and
awakening key regulatory pathways within the cell. The poorly
differentiated aggressive cells characterized by high mitotic
activity were virtually eliminated within these tumors by
epigenetic therapy. Paramount to the effectiveness of this
therapy may be the reexpression of polycomb-regulated genes,
many of which code for transcription factor binding proteins,
and the p16 gene that plays a key role in cell proliferation as a
negative regulator of cyclin/CDK complexes (34).

Targeting the Epigenome for Therapy

The most dramatic effects seen with the addition of MS-275
was the enhanced reexpression of a subset (cluster 2) of PRC2
target genes that include members of the Hox family recognized for their role in regulating apoptosis, receptor signaling,
differentiation, motility, and angiogenesis networks that were
increased by this therapy (36).
The extension of this low-dose combination epigenetic
therapy to solid tumors in the clinic is just beginning with
phase II trials in lung, breast, and colon cancer starting or in
progress. The dramatic response seen in this orthotopic model
has been replicated in patients participating in a phase II trial
of 5-Aza þ MS-275. Complete, partial, or long-term stabilization responses were observed in 3 patients, respectively with
advanced stage NSCLC that had progressed after several other
therapies (Juergens, unpublished data). These exciting

Figure 5. Epigenetic therapy reduces expression of EZH2. TaqMan PCR
was used to quantify the change in expression of EZH2 in tumors from
animals treated with 5-Aza (n ¼ 20) or 5-Aza þ MS-275 (n ¼ 15) relative to
expression in vehicle tumors (n ¼ 4). Values are mean  SEM.

Several studies show the targeting of PcG proteins for
silencing by promoter hypermethylation in malignant tumors
and this was also observed in the Calu-6 tumors (25, 29, 30).
The effectiveness of epigenetic therapy in demethylation of
these genes may relate to the dual role of DNMT1 in cytosine
methylation and its interaction with the PRC2 proteins (27).
The depletion of DNMT1 and reduced expression of EZH2
seen with 5-Aza should lead to disruption of this repressive
chromatin state and this may augment the incorporation of
this nucleoside analog during replication to facilitate cytosine
demethylation. The heterogeneity of demethylation seen in
the response of individual lung tumors to epigenetic therapy is
not surprising given the difference in size (<1–3 mm 5 weeks
after engraftment) and proportion (25%–75%) of pleomorphic
tumor cells growing in the lungs of vehicle-treated animals
(14). Size differences of 4-fold were also seen in tumors
collected from treated animals. Thus, the microenvironment
of the nude rat lung clearly impacts tumor composition and
growth to provide a setting that more closely recapitulates the
human lung, and is superior to subcutaneous xenograft models. Remarkably, irrespective of this plasticity, hundreds of
genes were still demethylated in each tumor, substantiating
the in vivo efficacy of this therapy.
The increased reduction in tumor burden seen with addition
of the HDAC inhibitor MS-275 may relate to its recognized
antiproliferative activity and synergism with 5-Aza to facilitate
gene reexpression of selected PRC2 target genes (10). HDAC
inhibitors strongly activate expression of the CDK inhibitor p21
that regulates cell cycle progression at G1 through enhanced
HDAC around its promoter (24). The greater expression of p21
in tumors exposed to 5-Aza þ MS-275 versus 5-Aza alone was
likely one contributor to the marked effect on genes within the
cell cycle. In addition, genes regulating apoptosis as noted by
the increased expression of Bik, a proapoptotic tumor-suppressor gene that is epigenetically regulated in cancer, were
also activated to a greater extent with combined therapy (35).

findings highlight the promise for epigenetic therapy in cancer
management. However, it will be critical to define tumor
characteristics and biomarkers that may be most responsive
or resistant to epigenetic therapy in order to better select
patients with the highest potential to respond. This validated
orthotopic lung cancer model, through its ability to evaluate
epigenetic therapy and reprogramming of the epigenome in
lung tumors harboring different genetic mutations and epigenetic profiles has already identified key regulatory genes
targeted for reexpression and should provide important new
insights to guide and further the development of human
clinical trials for the treatment of lung cancer.
