ABSTRACT
Non-muscle invasive bladder cancers (NMIBC) are typically treated by
transurethral resection with intravesical chemotherapy. However, the post-therapeutic
incidence of tumor recurrence and progression to muscle invasive disease is high,
and the underlying mechanism(s) remains unknown. In this study, we observed
that recurrent bladder cancer cells exhibit a mesenchymal phenotype, which is
initiated by the autocrine GRO-α signaling. Mechanically, the chemotherapeutic
drug epidoxorubicin induces GRO-α expression in primary bladder cancer cells at
G1/S phase via p38-dependent activation of NF-κB. GRO-α phosphorylation of Snail
on Ser246 supports Snail’s accumulation in the nucleus, and thereby promotes
transcription repression activity of Snail from E-cadherin promoters. In accordance,
disrupting the GRO-α-Snail axis in NMIBC represents a promising alternative to
prevent post-therapeutic tumor progression and recurrence.

the benefits of treatment, notably reducing disease
recurrence and preventing progression.
Tumor cells progress from non-invasive to malignant
phenotypes via a series of critical steps that involve
morphological changes referred to as the epithelial–
mesenchymal transition (EMT). EMT is a process
originally observed during the embryonic development, in
which cells lose epithelial characteristics [4, 5]. Activation
of the latent EMT program confers upon cancer cells a
distinct advantage for local invasion [6, 7]. In deed,
Baumgart et al. characterized the expression of E-cadherin,
β-catenin, plakoglobin, and vimentin in a series of primary
bladder tumors. Downregulation of epithelial markers was
associated with disease progression in terms of both grade
and stage (i.e., superficial vs. muscle-invasive cancer), and
in univariate analyses, downregulation of either β-catenin
or plakoglobin was associated with shorter disease-specific

INTRODUCTION
Approximately 75–85% cases of newly diagnosed
bladder cancer are non-muscle invasive bladder cancer
(NMIBC), including non-muscle invasive papillary or
flat lesions (pTa and pTis, respectively) and invasive
urothelial carcinomas involving the lamina propria
(pT1) [1]. NMIBC is typically treated by transurethral
resection and intravesical chemotherapy. The American
Urological Association (AUA) considers all high grade
pTa, pTis and pT1 to be at high risk for recurrence
and progression; pT1 tumors in particular show a
highly divergent behavior, with progression rates of
17% to 50%, despite therapy. Muscle-invasive bladder
carcinoma is clinically unfavorable, with a 5-year
overall survival rate of 48% to 67% [2, 3]. Therefore,
development of novel therapies is needed to maximize

survival [8]. With respect to the chemotherapy, previous
studies have demonstrated a close link between EMT and
treatment of chemotherapeutic agents. For example, Li et
al. previously showed that transient adriamycin treatment
induced EMT and apoptosis simultaneously in breast
cancer cells. Only the cells undergoing EMT showed
enhanced invasion/metastasis and multidrug resistance
[9]. In addition, Kajiyama et al. identified an association
between chronic paclitaxel resistance and induction of
EMT in epithelial ovarian carcinomas [10]. Based on these
observations, we hypothesize that EMT may contribute
to the malignant phenotypes of bladder cancers after
receiving chemotherapy.
In the current study, we demonstrated that
recurrent bladder cancer cells undergoing chemotherapy
preferentially exhibited a mesenchymal phenotype. In
particular, recurrent bladder cancer cells undergoing
chemotherapy secret growth-regulated protein alpha
(GRO-α), which triggers the process of EMT through
regulating phosphorylation and functions of Snail. In
clinical settings, treatment of relapsed tumor using the
regimen that resulted in remission of the primary tumor
is suboptimal. The current study raises the possibility
of preventing/delaying tumor relapse via manipulating
specific signaling pathway(s).

Recurrent bladder cancer cells exhibit a
mesenchymal phenotype
We obtained bladder cancer cells from three paired
primary and relapsed tumor samples (PB1-3 vs. RB1-3).
Routine morphologic observation showed that primary
tumor cells grew in the form of tightly-packed colonies
characteristic of epithelial cells, while most recurrent
tumor cells looked flattened, spread actively and underwent
cytoskeletal rearrangement (Figure 1A). These phenomena
were associated with decreased expression of E-cadherin,
formation of actin stress fibers (F-actin), and up-regulation
of N-cadherin (Figure 1A and Supplementary Figure 1A).
Compared with their corresponding primary counterparts,
the invasion rate of the recurrent tumor cells increased by
5.7-8.2 fold (Figure 1B), without showing any change in
cell proliferation(Supplementary Figure 1B).
EMT is a process reminiscent of CSCs. Within 7
days, all individual cells produced non-adherent multicellular oncospheres highly expressing bladder CSC
markers, such as CD44 and 67LR (Supplementary
Figure 1C). Noticeably, the recurrent bladder cancer cells
showed a 2.1-5.8-fold increase in oncosphere-forming

capacity over the matched primary tumor cells (Figure
1C). Moreover, we performed limiting dilution assays
to determine self-renewal capacity. Oncospheres from
primary tumors showed limited expansion and could not
be maintained beyond passage 2 (<2 passages), while
all recurrent tumors yielded sphere cells with extended
passages (>4 passages). To extend these observations,
we examined the expression of putative CSC markers in
the paired primary and recurrent bladder carcinomas by
flow cytometric analysis. As compared with the matched
primary tumors, most recurrent bladder cancer cells (RB1
and RB3) possessed a higher percentage of CD44- and
67LR-positive populations. Although there was only a
negligible difference in the amount of CD44-positive
cells between PB2 and RB2, RB3 possessed a 2.3-fold
increase in 67LR-positive population compared with PB3
(Figure 1D). These data suggest that recurrent bladder
cancer cells underwent epithelial-mesenchymal transition
accompanied with malignant progression.

in comparison with the corresponding primary cancer
cells (Supplementary Figure 2B).These data suggest
the existence of autocrine GRO-α-CXCR2 signaling in
recurrent bladder cancer cells.
Next, we evaluated the effect of GRO-α on EMT
in bladder cancer cells. Following GRO-α treatment for
24h, primary PB2 cells exhibited a marked alteration
in cell morphology, changing from the characteristic
organized ‘cobblestone’ appearance of epithelial cell
monolayers to a disorganized elongated fibroblastlike phenotype. In contrast, these cells treated with the
specific CXCR2 inhibitor, SB-656933, in the presence
of GRO-α maintained their epithelial phenotype (Figure
2D). Moreover, treatment of RB2 cells with SB-656933
led to morphological changes consistent with transition
from a mesenchymal to an epithelial phenotype (Figure
2F). Consistent with the morphological findings,
immunoblotting analysis of primary PB2 revealed
diminished levels of E-cadherin and increased N-cadherin
expression following GRO-α treatment. In PB2 cells
treated with SB-656933 and GRO-α, the expression of
both E-cadherin and vimentin remained unchanged, as
compared with the control cells treated with the vehicle for
both conditions (Figure 2E). As anticipated, in RB2 cells,
inhibition of GRO-α-CXCR2 signaling by SB-656933
potently upregulated the expression level of E-cadherin,
while downregulated the mesenchymal marker N-cadherin
(Figure 2G). These data suggest that mesenchymal
transformation of recurrent bladder cancer cells was
dependent on the autocrine GRO-α-CXCR2 signaling.

GRO-α derived from recurrent bladder cancer
cells elicits epithelial-mesenchymal transition
To figure out whether the differential phenotypes
were attributed to cancer cells themselves or the unique
microenvironment, we isolated epithelial and stromal
cells from recurrent tumor tissues and transferred them
to the upper chamber of the Transwell, while the bottom
compartment was seeded with the matched primary
tumor cells (Figure 2A). This transwell system allows for
exchange of diffusible factors but not cells between the
chambers. PB1 cells cocultured with RB1 cells showed
a fibroblast-like cell morphology. Furthermore, coculture
with RB1 cells induced the loss of E-cadherin expression
and formation of actin stress fibers in PB1 cells (Figure
2B). Correspondingly, increased expression of N-cadherin
and down-regulation of E-cadherin were also observed
in PB1 cells (Supplementary Figure 2A). In contrast, no
similar phenomena were observed in PB1 cells cocultured
with stromal cells (Figure 2B and Supplementary Figure
2A), suggesting that recurrent bladder cancer cells
themselves created a distinct environment for induction
of EMT.
Using SINQ and MaxQuant label-free proteomic
software, we performed a comparative analysis on
differentially expressed proteins in the supernatant of
recurrent bladder cancer cells. As compared with PB1
cells, 23 proteins in RB1 cells underwent differential
expression by at least 3 fold, among which GRO-α
underwent more than five-fold change. We further
validated GRO-α expression, and found that GRO-α
secretion, as well as its expression, in the recurrent
cancer cells was significantly elevated as compared
with that in their primary counterparts (Figure 2C).
CXCR2 is the specific receptor for GRO-α. Recurrent
bladder cancer cells exhibited similar levels of CXCR2

Epidoxorubicin induces GRO-α expression in
bladder cancer cells in a cell cycle-dependent
manner via the p38/MAPK-NF-κB pathway
The bladder cancer patients in our series experienced
recurrence after intravesical chemotherapy. Epidoxorubicin,
the drug used most often for intravesical chemotherapy,
induced concurrence of different events (apoptosis vs.
GRO-α secretion) in PB2 and PB3 cells (Figure 3A). To
investigate the underlying mechanism, we examined the
contribution of cell cycle state. PB2 and PB3 cells were
synchronized at either G1/S or G2/M phase, after which
epidoxorubicin-induced effects were examined. As shown
in Figure 3B, epidoxorubicin induced GRO-α expression
only in cells synchronized at G1/S phase, whereas it induce
apoptosis in cells synchronized at G2/M phase.
We then investigated potential transcription factors
involved in regulation of GRO-α expression. The GRO-α
promoter 5′-flanking region (spanning from bp −980 to
+76) and its sequentially deleted fragments (starting from
−980, −390, −100 and −80 to +76bp) were prepared by
PCR and cloned into luciferase expression vectors (Figure
3C). Stimulation with epidoxorubicin markedly increased
the luciferase activity in constructs containing sequences
from −980 to −80bp, which included NF-κB binding

sites. However, the construct from which the sequence
from −980 to −80bp was deleted produced no response to
drug treatment. The construct lacking the sequence from
−980 to −100bp produced the strongest luciferase activity
in drugs-stimulated cells (Figure 3C), suggesting the
involvement of NF-κB in regulating GRO-α expression.
To test this possibility, we evaluated the GRO-α promoter
activity after cotransfection of the candidate transfactor
in primary bladder cancer cells. It was found that the
expression of p65 S276D (a constitutively active form
of NF-κB) was associated with a significant increase

in the GRO-α promoter activity, while Egr1, CDP had
no effect on promoter activity in the context of primary
bladder cancer cells (Figure 3D). The crucial event in
the activation of NF-κB is the phosphorylation of IκB. In
agreement with this, IκB phosphorylation was induced
3h after epidoxorubicin treatment, earlier than GRO-α
expression (Figure 3E). The drug-induced GRO-α
expression was significantly suppressed by either IκBα
super-repressor (a protein with mutations that render
it resistant to stimulus-induced degradation) or NF-κB
siRNA in PB2 cells (Figure 3F).

Previous studies indicated that MAPK/p38 activation
promotes cancer cell survival after chemotherapy [11,
12]. Epidoxorubicin induced p38 activation in PB1 cells
at G1/S phase but not at G2/M phase (Figure 3G). P38
signaling inhibition with SB202190 or SB203580 showed
that IκB phosphorylation was p38 dependent, as p38
inhibition led to attenuation in drug-induced phospho-IκB
abundance and subsequent GRO-α expression (Figure
3H). These data suggest that epidoxorubicin induced
GRO-α expression in primary bladder cancer cells at G1/S
phase via p38-dependent activation of NF-κB.

GRO-α after 24h treatment and significantly suppressed
by pre-treatment of SB656933. However, the levels of
other EMT-related molecules, such as slug, twist1, ZEB1
and SIP1, were not affected (Figure 4A). To explore the
potential effect of GRO-α signaling upon the functions of
Snail, we examined the impact of GRO-α on the ability
of Snail to repress E-cadherin promoter activity. Our
results showed that either GRO-α or constitutively active
CXCR2 mutant had an inhibitory effect on E-cadherin
promoter activity. GRO-α-induced effects were largely
abolished by knockdown of Snail (Figure 4B). We
also examined the effect of GRO-α on two additional
Snail-regulated genes, tight junction membrane protein
occludin and estrogen synthetase enzyme aromatase.
GRO-α treatment promoted the ability of Snail to
repress transcription from both occludin- and aromatase-

promoter reporters. Consistent with the role of GRO-α in
modulating Snail activity, inhibition of GRO-α-CXCR2
signaling with a dominant-negative CXCR2 relieved
the repression effect of Snail on occludin and aromatase
promoter activity (Figure 4C).
To gain deeper insights into the regulatory effect
of GRO-α-CXCR2 signaling on Snail functions, we
examined the effect of GRO-α upon the subcellular
localization of Snail in bladder cancer cells by scanning
confocal microscopy. We found that knockdown of
GRO-α expression by siRNA led to almost complete
disappearance of nuclear Snail in RB3 cells, while
GRO-α promoted nuclear translocation of cytoplasmic
Snail in PB3 cells (Figure 5A). Interestingly, we noticed
dose-dependent phosphorylation of Snail by GRO-α
(Figure 5B). PI3K and p38 MAPK are two important
downstream signaling pathways of CXCR2 [13–15].
Inhibition of PI3K pathway, but not p38 signaling,
largely abolished GRO-α-induced Snail phosphorylation
in the RB3 cells (Figure 5C and Supplementary Figure
3A). To determine whether Snail was a novel substrate
of PI3K, we then did the in vivo Snail phosphorylation
assay. We cotransfected serum-starved 293 T cells with

HA-tagged Snail, with or without catalytically active
PI3K (PI3KCA), after which the cells were labeled
with [32P]orthophosphoric acid. It was found that HASnail could be phosphorylated by PI3KCA but not by
wild type PI3K in serum-starved conditions (Figure
5D). To map the PI3K phosphorylation site in Snail, we
identified five potential phosphorylation sites in Snail
and substituted all potential serine or threonine residues
with alanine in the potential phosphorylation sites by
site-directed mutagenesis (Thr203Ala, Ser221Ala,
Thr229Ala, Thr257Ala, and Ser246Ala) (Supplementary
Figure 3B). The site of GRO-α-induced PI3K-mediated
phosphorylation on Snail was identified as Ser246
(Figure 5E). Next, we compared the repression
activity of Snail Ser246Ala mutant with that of wildtype Snail against a Snail-target gene reporter assay.
GRO-α-mediated repression of transcription from the
E-cadherin, occludin and aromatase promoters were
significantly relieved by the mutant Snail Ser246Ala
(Figure 5F). These results suggest that GRO-α-induced
phosphorylation of Snail modulated its transcriptional
activity by increasing accumulation of Snail in the
nucleus.

DISCUSSION

Overcoming post-therapeutic recurrence of
bladder cancers by disrupting GRO-α-mediated
EMT

Bladder cancer carries a high risk of recurrence and
poor prognosis due to muscle invasion and metastasis. In
this study, we observed that bladder cancer recurrence
was associated with the aberrant mesenchymal phenotype.
Mesenchymal recurrent bladder cancer cells secreted
multiple cytokines and growth factors, including
transforming growth factor beta, interleukin-8, EGF,
Wnt, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating
factor, many of which are involved in malignancy
progression in various types of carcinomas [16–18]. In
particular, mesenchymal recurrent BCa cells undergoing
chemotherapy are the major source of GRO-α. For cells at
G1/S phase, chemotherapy drugs induced the expression
of GRO-α. This was not observed in cells at G2/M phase.
Our data well explain how bladder cancer cells respond
to chemotherapy heterogeneously in terms of cell cycle
phases. GRO-α is a member of the CXC chemokine
family. The biological function of GRO-α is primarily
mediated via CXCR2, a seven-transmembrane G proteincoupled receptor. GRO-α has been reported to play a
critical role in tumorigenesis, angiogenesis, and metastasis
[13–15, 19, 20]. Although a higher expression of GRO-α

Due to the significance of EMT in cancer progression,
we tested whether abrogating the process of EMT would
prevent post-therapeutic recurrence. We generated the
PB2 cells expressing GRO-α shRNA under the conditional
control of Tet (Figure 6A), after which these cells were
subcutaneously transplanted into NOG mice. All 8-weekold mice harboring non-invasive bladder cancer cells
were subjected to epidoxorubicin alone, or Tet alone,
or epidoxorubicin plus Tet treatment. Treatment with
epidoxorubicin alone produced >82% tumor regression
within 4 weeks (Figure 6B), but significantly increased
the percentage of N-cad+ cells, accompanied by reduced
quantity of E-cad+ cells, in residual lesions (Figure 6D).
Recurrence was observed in 9 out of 10 such mice within 2
weeks of treatment cessation (Figure 6B). In stark contrast,
blocking GRO-α production by administration of Tet
significantly abolished the process of EMT (Figure 6C and
6D). Treatment with epidoxorubicin plus Tet effectively
decreased tumor size, and no recurrence was noted in any
subject (Figure 6B).

was associated with the invasive phenotype of bladder
cancer both in vitro and in vivo [21, 22], the detailed
mechanism of this chemokine in invasive potential of
bladder cancer is poorly understood. As the GRO-α
receptor CXCR2 is expressed in all bladder cancer cells
irrespective of the mesenchymal phenotype, it is probable
that secretion of GRO-α is associated with bladder cancer
recurrence via an autocrine loop involving its receptor.
Here, we demonstrated that the interaction between
GRO-α and CXCR2 induces activation of PI3K signaling.
GRO-α-induced PI3K-mediated phosphorylation of Snail
on Ser246 promotes Snail’s nuclear accumulation and
consequently its repressor activity on the promoter of

E-cadherin. Ultimately, the bladder cancer cells undergo
EMT and become highly invasive. In line with these,
our in vivo studies demonstrated that interfering with the
GRO-α/CXCR2 axis considerably disrupted the process of
EMT, suggesting that the GRO-α/CXCR2 axis represents
the driving force of mesenchymal transformation.
Mounting evidence has implied the contributions of
EMT in the emergence of treatment failure and tumor
recurrence. Accordingly, abolishing GRO-α-induced EMT
successfully prevented post-chemotherapeutic relapse. In
this sense, disrupting the GRO-α-CXCR2 axis in NMIBC
may represent a promising alternative to prevent postchemotherapy cancer progression and recurrence.

tumor cultures from three patients were sorted as cancer
cells and stromal cells by CK7 antibody via FACS LSRII
(BD Biosciences). Cancer cells were termed as PB1, PB2
and PB3 in primary cancers, and RB1, RB2 and RB3 in
recurrent cancers. 293T cells were culture at 37°C with
5% CO2 in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% v/v FBS
and penicillin (100units/ml)/streptomycin (0.1mg/ml).
SB656933, SB202190, SB203580 and LY294002 were
purchased from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA, USA) and
Human recombinant GRO-α was from ProSpec Biology
(East Brunswich, NJ, USA). The firefly and Renilla DualGlo™ Luciferase Assay System was purchased from
Promega (Madison, WI, USA). The pRL-null plasmid,
which encodes Renilla luciferase, was purchased from
Promega.

Western blot analysis
Protein preparations from the indicated cells were
obtained by lysing samples in 50 mmol/L of TRIS (pH
7.5), 100 mmol/L of NaCl, 1% NP40, 0.1% Triton, 2
mmol/L of EDTA, 10 Ag/mL of aprotinin, and 100 Ag/mL
of phenylmethylsulfonyl-fluoride. Prestained molecular
weight standards were from Bio-Rad (Milan). Proteins
separated on the polyacrylamide gels were blotted on
a PVDF membrane. The membrane was stained with
Ponceau S (Sigma) to enable us to evaluate the success
of transfer, and to locate the molecular weight markers.
Free protein binding sites on the PVDF membrane were
blocked with nonfat dry milk and a Tween 20/TBS
solution. The membranes were washed and stained with
specific primary antibodies and with secondary antisera,
and then conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (SigmaAldrich) diluted 1:2,000. The anti-E-cadherin, anti-Ncadherin, anti-CXCR2, anti-phospho-P38, anti-P38,
anti-IκB, anti-NF-κB, anti-slug, anti-twist1, anti-ZEB1,
anti-Snail and anti-SIP1 antibodies were purchased from
Abcam, and the anti-GRO-α antibody was from Santa
Cruz. The luminescent signal was visualized with the ECL
Western blotting detection reagent kit (Amersham) and
quantified by scanning with a Discover Pharmacia scanner
equipped with a Sun Spark Classic Workstation.

Xenograft studies
Subcutaneous xenograft tumor models were
established based on 4-week-old female BALB/c-nu mice.
The mice were housed in a pathogen-free facility at the
Second Military Medical University. All animal protocols
are in compliance with ethical regulations and have been
approved by the Institutional Animal Care Use Committee
of Second Military Medical University. For Sub-Q
xenografts, the indicated cells suspended in 100μl Hanks
buffered saline solution were injected subcutaneously in
the axillary region of the right chest in BALB/c-nu/nu
mice. Tumor volume was measured every 2 days starting
from day 4 post-injection to monitor the extent of tumor
growth, regression and recurrence. Tumor volume was
calculated using the formula: 1/2(Length×Width2). When
tumor reached ~1cm in diameter, mice were randomly
divided into the indicated groups and the mean tumor
volumes of each group were similar before the treatment
started. No mice were excluded after the treatment started.

Isolation of primary epithelial and stromal cells
from bladder specimens
Tumor specimens were processed within 1 to 2 h
of surgery. Each sample was minced in small fragments
(<1 mm3), in a sterile environment. Tissue fragment were
then digested at 37°C, for 2 to 4 h in a solution of type
IV collagenase, 1 mg/ml (Sigma-Aldrich), containing
40 mg/ml of bovine serum albumin, 2 mg/ml of glucose,

100 units/ml of penicillin and 100 mg/ml of streptomycin
(P+S; Sigma-Aldrich), 50 mg/L of gentamicin (SigmaAldrich), and 1.25 mg/L of Fungizone (Life Technologies).
After incubation, the samples were extensively rinsed with
PBS and suspended in culture media. Each sample was
divided into two aliquots, one to be frozen and one to be
cultured. Cells underwent three cycles of centrifugation
and were differentially separated by centrifugation. Briefly,
increasing speeds of centrifugation (40-100-200×g)
generated three cell populations: epithelial-enriched (EE),
stromal-enriched (SE), and organoid substance (OS). The
cells were seeded separately in 24-wells at a density of
105 cells/well and cultured in standard medium: RPMI
1640 supplemented with 2 mmol/L of glutamine (SigmaAldrich), P+S, 15 mmol/L HEPES (Sigma-Aldrich), and
with different percentages of FBS and hormones and
growth factors. EE and OS cells were cultured in 0.5%
FBS and a mixture of six supplements (6H) for at least
15 days. SE were cultured in 10% FBS medium. Because
after 15 days, the growth rate of EE cells was very low or
null, we enzymatically [trypsin-EDTA solution (Cambrex)
for 2 min at 37°C] detached and seeded the cells on top of
the sister semiconfluent SE dish. Cells were maintained at
37°C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. The medium
was renewed twice weekly. The two cell types were easily
identified by their morphology.

medium. The number of oncospheres in each well was
counted on day 7. At this cell density (1,000 cells per
well) in the 24-well plates, cells did not cluster together.
Oncosphere formation was determined at the indicated
time points by automated imaging on an inverted
microscope (Axiovert 100M, Carl Zeiss).

CCK-8 cell proliferation
Cells were counted and the concentration of the
cell suspension was adjusted to 5×104 cells/ml. Using
serial dilution, cell suspension (100 μl) was added to each
well of the 96-well microplate. 10 μl cell counting Kit-8
(CCK-8) was added to each well and reacted in a CO2
incubator for 4h. Absorbance was measured at 450 nm on
a microplate reader.

Flow cytometry
For cell apoptosis and cell cycle, 1x105 cells were
seeded per well in a 12-well plate for 24h and then treated
with 10 μmol/L epidoxorubicin. After 24h incubation,
cells were collected, stained with propidium iodide (PI)
and APC-conjugated Annexin V (Apoptosis detection kit,
Invitrogen), and analyzed by flow cytometry and software
(BD Biosciences).

In vivo phosphorylation

Transwell cell invasion and coculture

293 T cells were transfected with either Snail
expression vector or the construct with the indicated
point mutations and cotransfected with with or without
catalytically active PI3K (PI3KCA). Cells were
labeled with [32P]orthophosphoric acid overnight.
Twenty-four hours after transfection, cell lysates were
immunoprecipitated with an anti-HA monoclonal antibody
(mAb) and then separated by 10% SDS-PAGE. Labeling
was visualized by autoradiography with a PhosphorImager.

For cell invasion assay, Transwell chamber (Corning
Inc.) was coated with Matrigel and DMEM (v/v 1:8), with
cultures below 80% confluence to ensure proper starvation
of cells without becoming confluent during the 24starvation period. The cell seeding concentration (5×105
cells/ml) was diluted with 150 μl serum-free medium
and added to Matrigel mixture. 500 μl DMEM with 10%
FBS was added to a lower compartment. Cultures were
incubated for 36h. The invaded cells were stained and
counted according to the manufacturers’ instructions. For
cell coculture assay, an equal number of PB1 cells and
RB1 cells were seeded in the upper compartment and
lower compartment of Transwell chamber, respectively.
Cell supernatants were collected for further assays.

Luciferase reporter assays
Cells in 24-well plates were transiently transfected
with the indicated promoter reporter constructs and
pRLTK Renilla luciferase plasmid (Promega) using
Fugene 6 (Roche). Cell extracts were prepared after
transfection, and luciferase activity was measured using
the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega).

Oncosphere formation assay
For oncosphere formation assay, cells were
trypsinized, counted as 5×105/ml, mixed in FBS-free
RPMI 1640 medium containing 20ng/ml EGF (SigmaAldrich), 10ng/ml FGF2 (Sigma-Aldrich), B27 (GIBCO),
and ITSS (Roche), plated onto ultralow attachment plates
(Corning), and incubated at 37°C with 5% CO2. Fresh
growth medium was added every 48h. To determine the
frequency of oncosphere-forming cells, one thousand
tumor cells were distributed into each well in lowattachment 24-well tissue culture plates in the stem cell

Protein quantitation and identification
The supernatant samples from PB1 and RB1 were
in-gel digested enzymatically and analyzed by LC-MS/
MS. The database search was performed using both the
X!Tandem and SEQUEST algorithms. Quantification
was first performed using Mascot 2.2. Using the Mascot
quantification method, protein quantification was

peptides with scores above the identity threshold. Protein
differential expression was also assessed at the peptide
level. All peptides were used to calculate global mean
and S.D. of peptide ratios (47-1/D3). The differentially
expressed peptides were used to infer differentially
expressed proteins.
