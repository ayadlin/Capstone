ABSTRACT
Background: There are currently no United States Food and Drug Administration
approved molecularly matched therapies for sarcomas except gastrointestinal stromal
tumors. Complicating this is the extreme diversity, heterogeneity, and rarity of these
neoplasms. Few therapeutic options exist for relapsed and refractory sarcomas. In
clinical practice many oncologists refer patients for genomic profiling hoping for
guidance on treatment options after standard therapy. However, a systematic analysis
of actionable mutations has yet to be completed. We analyzed genomic profiling results
in patients referred to MD Anderson Cancer Center with advanced sarcomas to elucidate
the frequency of potentially actionable genomic alterations in this population.
Methods: We reviewed charts of patients with advanced sarcoma who were
referred to investigational cancer therapeutics department and had CLIA certified
comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) of 236 or 315 cancer genes in at least 50ng
of DNA. Actionable alterations were defined as those identifying anti-cancer drugs
on the market, in registered clinical trials, or in the Drug-Gene Interaction Database.
Results: Among the 102 patients analyzed median age was 45.5 years (range
8-76), M: F ratio 48:54. The most common subtypes seen in our study were
leiomyosarcoma (18.6%), dedifferentiated liposarcoma (11%), osteosarcoma (11%),
well-differentiated liposarcoma (7%), carcinosarcoma (6%), and rhabdomyosarcoma
(6%). Ninety-five out of 102 patients (93%) had at least one genomic alteration
identified with a mean of six mutations per patient. Of the 95 biopsy samples with
identifiable genomic alterations, the most commonly affected genes were TP53
(31.4%), CDK4 (23.5%), MDM2 (21.6%), RB1 (18.6%), and CDKN2A/B (13.7%).
Notable co-segregating amplifications included MDM2-CDK4 and FRS2-FGF. Sixteen

least stable disease.
Conclusions: Incorporating CGP into sarcoma management may allow for more
precise diagnosis and sub-classification of this diverse and rare disease, as well as
personalized matching of patients to targeted therapies such as those available in
basket clinical trials.

we present 102 sarcoma patients that were referred to the
Investigational Therapeutics Department which is the phase
1 clinical trials program at MD Anderson Cancer Center.

INTRODUCTION
Recurrent and metastatic sarcomas are a rare and
heterogeneous group of diseases. With well over 70
subtypes, the exact diagnosis alone can be challenging
to make [1]. When sarcomas progress beyond
efficacious local control, the standard practice with
few notable exceptions is to treat with cytotoxic agents
until progression or intolerance [2]. Unfortunately,
these cytotoxic agents yield overall response rates
of around 25% [3, 4]. Over the last three decades
recurrent translocations have been found that drive the
development of certain sarcomas and are now used as
an adjunctive diagnostic tool [5, 6]. Unfortunately,
in clinical practice most sarcoma therapies are not
yet targeting these unique and simple fusions. While
the transcription factor fusions pose an enormous
drug development challenge, the kinase fusions are
potentially targetable with current technology. A notable
exception is non-fusion genomic alterations in kinases,
with gastrointestinal stromal tumors serving as the
paradigm of druggable c-Kit alterations by imatinib
[7, 8]. A separate sub-group of sarcomas have complex
cytogenetic changes hallmarked by genomic instability
and are not characterized by discrete gene fusions [9].
The promise of personalized medicine has become
a realization for many malignancies. Pairing genomic
alterations and targeted therapy has transformed diseases
like lung cancer, leukemia, and breast cancer [10-12].
Outside of gastrointestinal stromal tumors, inflammatory
myofibroblastic tumors, and PECOMAs [13], targeted
therapies in sarcomas have not seen such breakthroughs.
Perhaps it is the staggering heterogeneity of the disease,
relative rarity, or difficulty making a definitive diagnosis
outside tertiary care centers that makes it challenging [1420]. To compound the problem, some of the sarcomas are
a group of biologically complex and resistant diseases
and, outside of surgically curable local disease, portend
an exceptionally poor prognosis when metastatic [21,
22]. A large portion of these patients will be referred for
clinical trials partly because of their young age, preserved
performance status, or scarcity of treatment options [23,
24]. To date much has been published about potentially
targetable alterations, but clinical translation in sarcoma has
been minimal [25-31]. We undertook a systematic analysis
of potentially druggable alterations in sarcomas based on
comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) performed in the
course of clinical care and evaluated clinical response in
patients receiving molecularly matched therapies. Here

RESULTS
All patients in this study had advanced or
metastatic relapsed or refractory sarcoma or did not
have any other standard care therapies available when
they presented for clinical trials. There were 48 men
(47%) and 54 women (53%) in this patient cohort with a
median age at diagnosis of 45.5 years (range 8-76). There
were 36 patients (35%) who had primary site biopsied
and sent for next generation sequencing (NGS) and 66
(65%) who had a metastatic site sent for NGS. Of the
102 patients, 38 were metastatic at time of diagnosis.
The most common histologies seen in our study was
leiomyosarcoma (8 uterine and 11 non-uterine, 18.6%),
dedifferentiated liposarcoma (11%), osteosarcoma (11%),
well-differentiated liposarcoma (7%), carcinosarcoma
(6%), and rhabdomyosarcoma (6%) (Table 1). All tumors
were reviewed and histology confirmed by MD Anderson
pathology department. The most frequently seen genomic
alterations are summarized in (Figure 1A). Ninety-five
out of 102 patients (93%) had at least one genomic
alteration identified with a mean of six alterations
per patient. The vast majority (49%) of all alterations
were amino acid substitutions. Amplifications were the
second most common alteration (31%). The remaining
alterations were split as described in (Figure 1B). The
most commonly altered genes were TP53 (31.4%), CDK4
(23.5%), MDM2 (21.6%), RB1 (18.6%), and CDKN2A/B
(13.7%) (Figure 1A).
Two of the most common alterations (MDM2 and
CDK4 amplifications) are both actionable. MDM2 was
altered in 22 patients and all were amplifications. All
22 of these patients also had CDK4 amplifications. One
additional patient had a CDK4 amplification without
MDM2 amplification. Ten of these co-amplified CDK4/
MDM2 cases were dedifferentiated liposarcomas,
seven were well-differentiated liposarcomas, two
rhabdomyosarcomas (one pleomorphic and one nos), one
osteosarcoma, one ewing sarcoma, and one unclassified
soft tissue sarcoma. Four of the well-differentiated
liposarcoma patients were treated with an investigational
MDM2 inhibitor and all achieved at least stable disease,
some showing a very durable response.
Other notable mutations include three FRS2 and
FGF co-amplifications seen in a rhabdomyosarcoma,

osteosarcoma, and dedifferentiated liposarcoma. The
rhabdomyosarcomas were FOXO1 fusion-negative, hinting
at a higher number of mutations [32]. We also identified
previously reported fusions of SSX with SS18 in synovial
sarcoma, as well as HMGA2 in liposarcoma. Three of the
leiomyosarcomas had a mutation in the Lynch syndrome
gene MSH2 (two uterine and one non-uterine). A complete
list of all identified mutations can be seen in (Table 2).
Of the 102 patients in our cohort, forty (39%)
had either no reported mutation (7%) or no actionable
mutation (32%). The remaining 62 (61%) patients all had
a potentially actionable alteration. Fourteen (14%) patients
had an alteration that could be targeted with an approved
drug in sarcoma (on-label). This was either an off-target
effect of pazopanib or imatinib and included five patients
with PDGFR (1 GIST), four with FGFR, three with KIT (2
GIST), and two with KDR gene aberrations.
Forty-six (45%) patients had an alteration that could
be targeted with a drug approved in another disease (offlabel). Sixty-one (60%) patients had an alteration that could
potentially be targeted by a drug currently available in
clinical trials and, barring particular exclusion criteria, all
of them could have been enrolled on a matching trial. Fiftyeight (57%) had an alteration for which a drug currently in
pre-clinical development could be used (Figure 2).
A subtype analysis of all sarcoma types revealed
that the probability of having an actionable mutation
was related to histology (Figure 3). Notable sarcoma
subtypes
include
dedifferentiated
liposarcoma
(100%), well-differentiated liposarcoma (100%), and
carcinosarcoma (83%) all of which had an exceptional
number of patients with actionable mutations. As noted
above, dedifferentiated/well-differentiated liposarcomas
had a preponderance of MDM2 and CDK4 mutations.
Carcinosarcomas had targetable mutations in AKT2 and
harbored a resistance mutation in ESR1 (Table 3).
Clinical response was highly variable. Forty-three
patients (42%) only received tumor sequencing, but did
not participate in a clinical trial. The remaining fiftynine patients (58%) chose to participate in a clinical trial.
Of these, sixteen (16%) received therapy directed by
molecular profile. Of these sixteen patients, eight (50%)
had at least stable disease (Table 4).

relative minority of samples had alterations targetable by
on-label drugs (Pazopanib or imatinib). This is almost
certainly driven by the paucity of approved (targeted)
therapies in sarcoma. There was a skew toward certain
histologic subtypes that harbor more potentially actionable
mutations. Well-differentiated and dedifferentiated
liposarcomas as well as carcinosarcomas stand out. Almost
every patient who was a candidate for an off-label drug
also had a drug available in a clinical trial. This speaks to
the large variety of compounds available in trials, and the
need to get sarcoma patients enrolled early and often.
One of the most frequent mutations seen in our cohort
was MDM2 amplification. This was exclusively seen coexisting with a CDK4 amplification. This alteration has
been reported most commonly in dedifferentiated/welldifferentiated liposarcoma [33] and rarely in osteosarcoma
[34]. In addition to the aforementioned subtypes our study
detected this co-amplification in rhabdomyosarcoma, Ewing
sarcoma (EWSR1 fusion positive), and an unclassified
sarcoma. We hypothesize that this co-amplified duo may be
more prevalent in other subtypes than previously thought.
MDM2 and CDK4 have previously been proposed as
tantalizing personalized targets in liposarcoma and indeed
clinical trials are underway [35]. However, our small dataset
suggests that such trials should be opened to all sarcoma
subtypes and based on CGP rather than histology due to
the occurrence of previously unreported mutations in the
subtypes mentioned above.
Similar to the MDM2 and CDK4 co-amplification,
we found FGF and FRS2 to be co-amplified. This has
previously been observed in dedifferentiated liposarcoma
and even found to be co-expressed with MDM2 and
CDK4. This co-amplification is not surprising since
FRS2 is the receptor substrate for FGF [36]. Despite this
known overexpression in liposarcoma, to our knowledge
this has never been reported in rhabdomyosarcoma or
osteosarcoma. Given the relatively well-studied pathway,
this FGF and FRS2 pathway is a salient potential target.
Within the last few months, Ponatinib has been reported
as a very potent inhibitor of this pathway in endometrial
cancer [37]. Potentially, this serves as a novel therapeutic
target in FRS2 and FGF co-amplified sarcomas.
While MDM2 and FRS2 are enticing for targeted
therapy, our finding of MSH2 in leiomyosarcomas
presents a potential for immunotherapy. MSH2 is an
integral component of the mismatch repair machinery and
causes microsatellite instability, creating a target for PD-1
blockade [38]. Successful treatment has been reported
with PD-1 inhibitors in MSI-high colon cancer resulting
in long-term disease control where chemotherapy had
not been effective. MSH mutations have been reported in
sarcomas previously, especially in uterine sarcomas [39].
While none of our three leiomyosarcoma patients received
immunotherapy, this would have been a potentially useful
therapy and opens up the possibility of a basket trial with
all-comer MSI-high tumors treated with anti PD-1 drugs.

DISCUSSION
Overall survival continues to be poor in metastatic
sarcoma as a group. With small numbers and large
diversity of subtypes, even the prospect of initiating and
accruing a study in this population is daunting. Given the
success of targeted therapy in other diseases, we sought
to discover if CGP could aid in diagnosis and treatment
of sarcomas as a whole. Using CGP we discovered that
61% of our patients had a potentially actionable mutation
which could be targeted with either an off-label or an
investigational therapeutic available in a clinical trial. A

Previous studies have assessed genomic biomarker
actionability [40, 41]. These studies included larger
numbers of patients and reported high frequencies
of clinically actionable genomic markers. However,
we believe this is the first study to look specifically
at sarcomas. We report significantly fewer actionable
mutations (61%) than previous studies of other cancers
(>90%) and this may be related to the fusion proteinsassociated sarcomas which comprise approximately 30%
of all sarcomas. Furthermore, this may suggest that many
sarcomas are driven by copy number alterations rather
than somatic mutations. It was encouraging to see that in
our center genomic testing is being used to drive clinical
decision in some patients. It was even more encouraging
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

to see that almost half of those patients (47%) derived
clinical benefit from mutational analysis based on at least
stable disease as per RECIST.
MDM2 is a negative regulator of the tumor
suppressor gene P53 and is a powerful oncogene. MDM2
and CDK4 (12q13-15 amplification) are co-amplified in
well differentiated liposarcoma. The response to current
therapies is poor. As in (Table 2) several patients with
MDM2 aberration benefitted clinically from MDM2
inhibitors in early phase clinical trials. Clinical trials are
underway in liposarcoma using MDM2 inhibitors either
singly or in combination with CDK4 inhibitors. The
efficacy of these agents as a group are to be determined
soon.

Our study confirms several previously described
overexpressed pathways in sarcomas such as MDM2CKD4 and FRS2-FGF. Importantly it demonstrates that
these are not unique to the previously described sarcomas,
and indeed are present in other subtypes. This underscores
the importance of NGS in all sarcoma patients to find
these potentially actionable mutations. Additionally, it
highlights the need for basket trials in sarcoma that are
targeted to mutations and pathways rather than histologic
subtypes. With properly designed trials, these could even
be accepted for drug registration or expanded indications.
Limitations abound in a retrospective observational
study such as ours. While we consider our census size to
be adequate, there was a wide variety of subtypes. Many
of these subtypes included a single individual making
any kind of conclusion impossible. This is an unfortunate
consequence of sarcoma heterogeneity. However, this
created a distinct advantage in showing that certain
pathways are deranged in diverse subtypes. Our definition
of an actionable mutation is based on aggregation of
myriad studies. The true clinical utility of any given
drug to target a particular mutation is not known until a
prospective trial is done. However, our observational study
was able to demonstrate at least anecdotal evidence of
clinical benefit from targeted therapy.
In conclusion, based on our findings we believe
that future studies in sarcomas should be guided by
NGS and actionable alterations rather than histologic
subtypes. Sarcomas are lacking in development of
targeted therapy, but we demonstrate that there are myriad
targets with novel therapeutic potential. We believe that
personalization will shape future therapy in oncology.
A rare and heterogeneous neoplasm like sarcoma would
especially benefit from such a personalized approach.

Tumors (RECIST V1.1). Date of death or last follow-up
were also noted.
Each of the represented clinical trials in this review
were independently approved by the MD Anderson
institutional review board (IRB) and patients provided
written consent to be treated with the corresponding
investigational therapy. This retrospective review was also
approved by the MD Anderson IRB.
NGS was performed by Foundation Medicine
(FoundationOne, http://www.foundationone.com), a
clinical grade CLIA-approved NGS test analyzing 236 or
315 cancer-related genes in at least 50ng of DNA from
routine formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE)
clinical specimens [42].
Actionable gene alteration was defined as any gene
alteration that is either directly targeted or a pathway
component of a directly targeted gene by an approved or
investigational drug [43] (Table 5).
Electronic medical records were reviewed for
above mentioned demographic and diagnostic data. The
respective molecular diagnostic reports were reviewed for
alterations with a potentially actionable mutation either
on-label, off-label, or in clinical trials. If patients received
treatment with an investigational therapeutic, this was
recorded along with the response.

Abbreviations
PD = progressive disease; PR = partial response; SD

MATERIALS AND METHODS
The electronic medical records of 102 diverse sarcoma
patients were reviewed and history, laboratory and clinical
findings were abstracted. These patients were referred to the
Investigational Therapeutics Department at MD Anderson
Cancer Center (MDACC). All pathology had previously
been reviewed and confirmed by an MDACC pathologist
with experience in bone and soft-tissue sarcomas. Therapies
differed based on clinical trial opportunities at date of visit.
All patients had a commercially available comprehensive
genomic panel from Foundation Medicine (FoundationOne,
http://www.foundationone.com). Profiling could have been
performed as part of prior care. Otherwise, genomic profiling
was performed upon phase 1 clinic presentation.
Patient attributes noted from the chart included
age, sex, race, tumor histology, and whether the biopsy
was from primary tumor or metastasis. Additional data
recorded include type of investigational therapy and start
date, as well as best overall response and duration of
response based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
