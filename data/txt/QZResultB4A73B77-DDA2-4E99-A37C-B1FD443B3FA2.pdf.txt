ABSTRACT
The Poly (ethylene glycol) methyl ether-block-poly (lactide-co-glycolide) (mPEGPLGA) nanoparticles carrying acetyltanshinone IIA (ATA), a novel anti-breast cancer
agent, were prepared by ultrasonic emulsion method to enhance the bioavailability and
reduce the toxicity. Systematic optimization of encapsulation process was achieved
using an orthogonal design. Drug efficacy analysis showed that ATA nanoparticles
were as effective as free ATA against estrogen receptor positive breast cancer cells,
but much less toxic towards human endothelial cells. Furthermore, in zebrafish, ATA
nanoparticles displayed much lower toxicity than free ATA. More importantly, the
blood concentration of ATA nanoparticles indicated by 24 hour-area under the curve
(AUC0-24h) was 10 times higher than free ATA. These results indicated the potential of
ATA-loaded mPEG-PLGA nanoparticles for the delivery of ATA in a clinical formulation,
and their potential for use in tumor therapy in the future.

effective anti-ER+ breast cancer agent than the current
therapeutics [23].
First, ATA exhibited stronger growth inhibition of
ER+ breast cancer cells than tamoxifen [23]. Second,
although both ATA and fulvestrant could bind to ER
and cause it to degrade, ATA completely abolished
the presence of ER while fulvestrant only reduced the
protein level [23]. Third, ATA reduced the expression of
ER at the mRNA level, while fulvestrant did not [23].
Finally, ATA reduced the transcription of a major ERresponsive gene, GREB1, indicating an ability to repress
the transcription activity of ER [23]. These merits suggest
that ATA is a promising anti-ER+ breast cancer candidate
for pharmaceutical development. However, our previous
study in rats indicated low bioavailability for ATA. To
solve this problem and prepare for future clinical trials
of ATA, a therapeutically applicable formula of ATA
that can improve in vitro aqueous solubility and in vivo
bioavailability was developed.
Conventional preparation methods, such as solution,
suspension, and emulsion, fail to provide sustained
therapeutic effects owing to limitations such as low

INTRODUCTION
Worldwide, breast cancer is the predominant cause
of female mortality. Among all types of breast cancers,
approximately 65% express high levels of the estrogen
receptor (ER) [1–3]. ER is a transcription activator that
usually localized in the nucleus in an inactive state [4–12],
and is activated mainly by estrogen. Currently, the most
effective drug to treat ER+ breast cancer are tamoxifen
and fulvestrant. However, the inhibitory effects of the
commercialized drugs on ER+ cancers are still far away
from satisfying because of the drug resistance and partial
therapeutic responses [13–17].
Tanshinone
IIA
(TIIA),
a
lipophilic
pharmacologically active compound extracted from
the medicinal herbal plant Radix Salviae miltiorrhizae
(Danshen), has been widely used to treat cardiovascular
diseases [18–20]. In addition, recent pharmacological
studies have revealed the anti-cancer effect of TIIA
on various types of cancer cells [21–22]. Recently, we
found that a chemically modified compound of TIIA,
acetyltanshinone IIA (ATA), had the potential to be a more

conventional methods, nanoparticles offer higher stability,
larger capacity, and a controlled release profile. After
considering various encapsulation strategies, poly(ethylene
glycol) methyl ether-block-poly (lactide-co-glycolide)
(mPEG-PLGA) was selected for the encapsulation of ATA
because it exhibits higher bioavailability and a longer
circulation period [24–26]. More importantly, both PEG
and PLGA have been approved by the United States Food
and Drug Administration for medical applications. Herein,
we report the generation, characterization, in vitro/in vivo
validation, and pharmacokinetic study of ATA-loaded
mPEG-PLGA nanoparticles (ATA NPs). The improved
solubility and bioavailability of ATA NPs demonstrated
that mPEG-PLGA is an ideal material to encapsulate ATA.
Furthermore, this formulation can potentially be used in
future clinical studies of the anticancer efficacy of ATA.

by the aromatic ring, so the peak position (1666.50 cm−1)
was smaller than the C=O signal in ATA (1770.65 cm−1).
Finally, the conjugated system of TIIA is weaker than
ATA, resulting in fewer, and weaker, C=C stretching
signal peaks around 1600 cm−1.

Optimization of critical factors for formulating
ATA NPs
Before designing the orthogonal array, several
preliminary experiments were carried out to determine the
important factors and their approximate effective ranges.
Then, an orthogonal experimental design was conducted to
design nine experiments [L9(34)] to test three factors (A:
percentage of F68, B: ratio of mPEG-PLGA:ATA, and C:
ultrasonic time) at three levels. The experimental design
is shown in Table 1 and the results are shown in Table 2.
Based on the results, a suitable formulation using the best
normalized percentage of encapsulation efficiency (EE%)
and drug loading (DL%) was selected.
The EE% and DL% obtained from different
experimental design runs are shown in Table 2; all
experimental runs were performed three times. The
optimized formulations in Table 2 are Test 6 and Test 9,
which have an EE% of 100.29% and 100.10%, and DL%
of 3.86% and 3.85%, respectively.
Based on statistical analysis of the data, each factor
was ranked according to its influence on the EE% and
DL% of the ATA NPs (Table 3). The influence on EE% of
ATA decreased in the order A>B>C, as indicated by the R
values of the orthogonal L9(34) test. The maximum EE%
of ATA was obtained when the F68 percentage was 0.5%,
the mPEG-PLGA: ATA ratio was 25:1, and the ultrasonic
time was 2.5 min (i.e., A2, B3, C3 in Table 1 ). The
influence on DL% of ATA decreased in the order B>A>C,
as indicated by the R values of orthogonal L9(34) test.
The maximum DL% of ATA was obtained when the F68
percentage was 0.5%, the mPEG-PLGA: ATA ratio was
15:1, and the ultrasonic time was 2.5 min, respectively
(i.e., A2, B1, C3 in Table 1).
With respect to the influence of the three tested
factors on EE% and DL%, the B factor showed more
influence on the DL% than the EE% of ATA NPs.
Considering the experimental results, the B1 level (mPEGPLGA:ATA=15:1) was favored to prepare the ATA NPs,
and thus the final composition of A2B1C3 was adopted.
Although this final composition was chosen in favor of
the DL% of ATA NPs, nonetheless, a very good EE% of
87.69% was achieved.

RESULTS
Chemical synthesis of ATA
ATA was synthesized by the reduction and
modification of the two carbonyl bonds of TIIA into two
ethyl ester bonds using sodium acetate, acetic anhydride,
and zinc. Boiling water was utilized to remove unreacted
acetic anhydride through a hydrolysis reaction, and
the final product was obtained by purification through
recrystallization in 95% ethanol (Figure 1A) [22]. The
recovery rate of ATA was 72%.
1
H NMR analysis was used to determine the
structure of ATA. Figure 1B shows the 1H NMR spectra
of TIIA and ATA. The following proton signals of TIIA
(1: –CH at δ 7.22; 2: –CH3– at δ 2.27; 3,4: –CH– at δ 7.64
and 7.56; 5: –CH2 at δ 3.19; 6,7: –CH2– at δ 1.79 and 1.64;
8,9: –CH3 at δ 1.31) were observed in the ATA molecule.
The characteristic signals of 10 and 11 at δ 2.39 attributed
to –CH3– were from ATA. These new signals indicated
the appearance of two ethyl ester bonds formed by the
attachment of acetic anhydride to the carbonyl group. This
NMR analysis indicated the successful synthesis of ATA.
Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra further
confirmed the successful synthesis of the compound ATA.
Figure 1C displays the FT-IR spectra of TIIA and ATA. A
characteristic band of TIIA was detected at 2951.09 cm−1,
which was assigned to the C-H vibration. A large peak
was also observed at 1666.50 cm−1, which was assigned
to the C=O group. The characteristic bands of ATA, which
were assigned to the C-H group, occurred at 2958.80
cm−1, 2931.80 cm−1, and 2866.22 cm−1. A large band was
also observed at 1770.65 cm−1, which was assigned to the
C=O group of ATA. In a comparison between TIIA and
ATA, the C-H signal of ATA was stronger and contained
more divided peaks than TIIA, because of the increased
number of C-H bonds and more complicated environment
in ATA. However, the C=O signal in TIIA was affected

Characterization of ATA NPs
The low water solubility of ATA had previously
restricted usage in vivo. To improve solubility, reduce
toxicity, prolong circulation time, and enhance
bioavailability, ATA NPs were formulated as shown in

The ATA NPs were prepared according to the optimized
preparation method.
We then determined essential physicochemical
properties of the ATA NPs including morphology,

size, charge, and physical state. Transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) analysis confirmed that ATA NPs were
spherical (Figure 2B) and measurements from the Malvern
Nano-ZS Particle Sizer indicated an average size of 69.93
nm (Figure 2C). The zeta potential of ATA NPs was -14.7
mV (Figure 2D), which indicated a satisfactory surface
charge distribution that is important for the stability of

NPs. The optimized ATA NPs exhibited a drug EE% of
88.10% and DL% of 5.54%.
The thermal analysis of ATA NPs was conducted
using thermogravimetry (TG) and differential thermal
analysis (DTA). The results of pure/unformulated and
formulated ATA are presented in Figure 3. The TG curve
of pure ATA showed that the mass loss of ATA occurred in
just one step within the temperature range of 220-310°C.
This step consisted of accelerated mass loss reaching
~100%, which was associated to a small DTA endothermic
peak. The DTA curve showed the appearance of an
endothermic peak at 175.72°C which was caused by the
phase transition of ATA. The TG profile of mPEG-PLGA
is different from that of ATA, as the mass loss occurred in
three steps: step 1 in the temperature range of 200-260°C,
step 2 in 260-350°C and step 3 in 350-400°C. It was
apparent that mPEG-PLGA did not have a phase transition
peak in the DTA curve before mass loss. Similar to pure
ATA, the TG curve of F68 displayed one step of mass
loss, but in the higher temperature range of 320-400°C
with a small DTA endothermic peak. The phase transition
temperature of F68 was at 54.92°C, which is much lower
than that of free ATA (Figure 3).
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

In the analysis of the physical mixture of the three
components of ATA NPs: ATA, mPEG-PLGA, and F68,
we found that the mass loss occurred after the temperature
crossed 220°C. Three DTA peaks were found at 54.00°C,
176.07°C and 247.39°C, which corresponded to the phase
transition temperature of F68 (54.92°C in the F68 curve),
ATA (175.72°C in the ATA curve), and mPEG-PLGA
(246.99°C in the mPEG-PLGA curve), respectively. In
contrast to the physical mixture, the curve for ATA NPs
showed only one phase transition temperature (54.41°C),
which suggested that ATA was molecularly dispersed
within the matrix of NPs, and demonstrated the amorphous
nature that further confirmed the encapsulation of ATA by
the matrix (Figure 3).

Evaluation of the stability and drug release
profiles of ATA NPs
The storage stability of ATA NPs under various
conditions was compared by monitoring changes in size
distribution and surface charge. At 4°C, although the zeta
potential of ATA NPs showed some variations after 3
days of incubation, the size of ATA NPs in PBS did not

change significantly over a period of seven days (Figure
4A). In contrast, both the particle size and zeta potential
were significantly decreased after storage in PBS at 37°C
for 5-7 days. These results suggested that ATA NPs were
stable in PBS at 4°C for seven days and at 37°C for four
days.
Solutions of 0.9% NaCl and 5% glucose were
compared for the compatibility-stability study of ATA
NPs at room temperature for 24 h. The results presented
in Figure 4B show that no significant changes of size and
zeta potential were detected in 0.9% NaCl. In contrast,
when ATA NPs were incubated with 5% glucose at room
temperature for 24 h, their size varied at 12 h and their
zeta potentials were significantly reduced at multiple time
points between 2 h and 6 h (Figure 4B). These results
indicate that ATA NPs are more stable in 0.9% NaCl than
in 5% glucose at room temperature, and should therefore
be prepared in 0.9% NaCl for use in future clinical
applications.
Next, we compared drug release profiles of ATA NPs
with those of free ATA. Owing to the hydrophobic nature
of ATA, the resulting poor solubility in aqueous media
led to a low concentration gradient across the dialysis
membrane, which slowed down the passive diffusion
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

process (Figure 4C). However, ATA NPs displayed
even slower drug release profiles than free ATA within
the 72 h-tested periods. For example, after 22 h of drug
release, 50% of ATA was released from free ATA solution,
while only 30% was released from ATA NPs. A similar
trend of slower release was also observed from ATA
NPs at the later time points of 48 and 72 h (Figure 4C).
In addition, unlike free ATA, the release profile of ATA
NPs shows no burst release of ATA at earlier time points
(Figure 4C), indicating that ATA was almost completely
entrapped in the NPs with few free ATA molecules in
solution or absorbed on the surface of NPs. In summary:
encapsulation of ATA with mPEG-PLGA significantly
prolonged its release from the NPs in this study.

In vitro determination of the anticancer efficacy
and general toxicity of ATA NPs
As ATA was previously shown to prominently
inhibit growth of ER+ breast cancer cells [23], MCF-7
breast cancer cells that express a high level of ER were
used to evaluate the anticancer efficacy of ATA NPs.
Meanwhile, human umbilical vein endothelial cells
(HUVEC) were used to determine the general toxicity of

ATA NPs on non-cancerous cells. Cells were treated with
free ATA or ATA NPs at six concentrations: 0.625, 1.25,
2.5, 5, 10, and 20 μM for 24, 48, and 72 h. Cell viability
was determined by the MTT assay and the experiment was
conducted in triplicate.
The dose-response curves in Figure 5 show that at
high concentrations of 10 μM and 20 μM, both free ATA
and ATA NPs effectively reduced the viability of MCF-7
cells by approximately 90% at 24 h, and by almost 100%
at 48 and 72 h. Although the efficacy of 5 μM ATA NPs
is lower than that of free ATA at 24 h, this difference was
reduced at 48 h and was further diminished at 72 h. More
importantly, the half-maximal inhibitory concentration
(IC50) values of free ATA and ATA NPs in MCF-7 cells

were very similar at all three time points (Table 4) and
ATA-NPs even achieved a slightly lower IC50 value at 72 h
of 0.99 μM compared with free ATA at 1.06 μM. Overall,
these results demonstrated that encapsulation of ATA in
the NPs did not decrease its anticancer efficacy compared
with free ATA on ER+ breast cancer MCF-7 cells; thus,
the ATA NPs formulation successfully retained the original
anticancer efficacy of ATA.
Compared with the significant cytotoxicity of ATA
on breast cancer MCF-7 cells, both forms of ATA were
much less toxic to normal HUVEC cells (Figure 5). In
particular, the 24 h-IC50 value of free ATA in HUVEC cells
(19.32 μM) was 7.4-fold higher than the value in MCF-7
cells (2.62 μM) (Table 4). More interestingly, the 24 h-IC50

values of ATA NPs in HUVEC cells (31.45 μM) was even
higher (11.56-fold) than the value in MCF-7 cells (2.72
μM). These results clearly demonstrate that the cytotoxic
effects of ATA NPs are more specific in cancer cells than
normal cells.

Various concentrations of the free and nanoparticle forms
of ATA were added to zebrafish embryos at four hours post
fertilization (hpf). The subsequent morphological changes
were observed at 96 hpf and heartbeats were measured
between 48-96 hpf. Images of the normal morphology
of zebrafish larvae from 0 to 96 hpf are shown in Figure
6A, while the examples of dead and deformed larvae are
shown in Figure 6B (right side).
Between 20-30 fish larvae were used for each
condition and each experiment was performed for
four times. Figure 6B shows the overall percentages of
deformed and dead zebrafish in each group. The data from
Figure 6B demonstrate that free ATA in the concentration

Evaluation of the impact of ATA NPs on the

range of 5-20 μM caused high toxicity in zebrafish
development. In particular, 100% mortality was recorded
in fish treated with 10 μM and 20 μM free ATA for 96 hpf,
and 70% mortality plus 20% deformity was observed at
5 μM. Even at 2.5 μM, free ATA damaged zebrafish by
causing a total of 40% death and abnormal development.
These results suggested that dosages of free ATA higher
than 1 μM caused deformity or mortality in zebrafish
larvae.
In contrast, ATA NPs demonstrated significantly
lower toxicity in zebrafish larvae than free ATA. For
example, much lower mortality rates were recorded when
fish larvae were treated with ATA NPs at 5, 10, and 20
μM for 96 hpf compared to free ATA. Additionally, no

zebrafish mortality was observed from ATA NPs at the
concentrations of 1 μM and 2.5 μM, which is 2.5-fold
higher than the 72 h-IC50 value in breast cancer MCF-7
cells. This result indicates that ATA NPs have lower in
vivo toxicity than free ATA.
In addition to that evaluation of larval mortality
and abnormality, we also monitored the zebrafish heart
function. As concentrations of 10 μM and 20 μM free ATA
killed all the fish larvae within 96 hpf, no heartbeats were
recorded with these two drug concentrations (Figure 6C).
Treatment with 5 μM free ATA significantly reduced the
heartbeats recorded at 96 hpf from 160 beats per minute
(bpm) in normal fish larvae to 120 bpm in ATA NPstreated fish larvae (Figure 6C). No signs of cardiotoxicity

obvious endogenous interferences under the described

extraction recovery of ATA for all tested concentrations
was 80.42% in the plasma and 81.77% in the blood,
respectively. No matrix effect on the analysis of ATA was
obvious after these treatments.
The results of the precision and accuracy are shown
in Table 7. The relative standard deviations (RSDs) of
intra-day variation for ATA from spiked rat plasma and
blood were less than 15.15% and 12.40%, respectively.
On the other hand, the RSDs of inter-day variation for
ATA from spiked rat plasma and blood were less than
7.03% and 5.11%, respectively. These results indicate that
the current method had a satisfactory precision for the
pharmacokinetic study of ATA NPs.

using Excel PKsolver. According to the requirements
for the selection of pharmacokinetic calculation model,
the values of Akaike’s information criterion and residual
sum of squares (Re) were minimized, while the value
of the determinate coefficient (r) was maximized.
The mean retention time was calculated by statistical
moment analysis. The main pharmacokinetic parameters
of free ATA and ATA NPs in rat whole blood are listed
in Table 8.
The information in Table 8 further confirmed that
encapsulation of ATA in NPs improved the bioavailability
in rats. For example, the 24 h-total area under the curve
(AUC0-24h) was increased 10-fold from 30.56 μM·min in
free ATA to 308.41 μM·min in ATA NPs. Additionally, the
mean retention time (MRT) of ATA NPs was four times
longer than free ATA (63.96 min vs 15.90 min). These
results showed that ATA NPs significantly increased the
bioavailability of ATA in rats.

Determination of the pharmacokinetic profile of ATA
NPs in rats
The validated RP-HPLC method was used to
determine the concentration of ATA in rat plasma and
whole blood following a single intravenous administration
of free ATA and or ATA NPs at 8 mg/kg body weight, for
both forms. As the ATA concentration in plasma was
too low to be detected after 15 min (possibly due to
absorption by red blood cells), we instead measured ATA
concentration in whole blood. The average whole blood
concentration of ATA was plotted against the time of
sample collection and displayed in Figure 7B. Compared
with free ATA, ATA NPs displayed prolonged circulation
time during the 240-min test (p < 0.05). The blood ATA
concentration in the free ATA-treated group declined
rapidly, and reached a very low level after 30 min of ATA
administration. In contrast, the blood ATA concentration in
the ATA NPs-treated group declined at a much slower rate,
and was still detectable 240 min after sample injection.
In particular, the concentration of ATA was reduced to
0.5 μM in 12 min in the free ATA-treated group, while

DISCUSSION
In the previous study, our group demonstrated that
acetyltanshinone IIA (ATA), a novel anti-cancer agent,
can effectively inhibit the growth of oestrogen receptor
positive (ER+) breast cancer cells. However, the low
aqueous solubility limited the use of ATA because of
the low bioavailability. Hence a method to improve its
aqueous solubility and bioavailability is essential. In
addition, chemotherapeutic drugs are known to have
various side effects to normal organs and cells. This
presents a need to find a way to reduce the toxic effects of
ATA on healthy tissue.
In this study, ATA was synthesized based on our
previously described method [22] and verified by NMR
and FITR (Figure 1). mPEG-PLGA was selected as the
encapsulation material for ATA into the NPs. mPEGPLGA can protect the encapsulated content from
being engulfed by phagocytic cells, and has become
a biodegradable polymer that is widely used for drug

delivery. To optimize the formulation of ATA-loaded
mPEG-PLGA NPs, orthogonal design, a statistical method
for analyzing several independent factors in a limited
number of experiments, was utilized. The final ATA NPs
were prepared using the optimized conditions of 0.5%
F68, 2.5 min of ultrasonic time, and an mPEG-PLGA to
ATA ratio of 15:1 (Table 3).
The resulting ATA NPs achieved a high
encapsulation efficiency of 88.10% and a good drugloading rate of 5.54%. The encapsulated ATA molecules
were indicated by the TG/DTA analyses to be molecularly
dispersed within the NP matrix which confirmed the
entrapment of ATA (Figure 3). Moreover, the stability
assays showed that ATA NPs remained stable after storage
in a physiological saline solution at 4°C and 37°C for 5-7
days. In addition, the release of ATA was significantly
prolonged by NP encapsulation.
One important advantage of the encapsulation
of therapeutic agents into NPs is that it may reduce the
potential toxicity of the active ingredients to normal cells.
The in vivo toxicity evaluation of ATA NPs showed that

the NP formulation produced much lower toxicity on the
mortality, development, and heart function of zebrafish
compared to the free ATA (Figure 6).
Finally, we developed a sensitive analytical method
for measuring the plasma and blood concentration of ATA
in rats. This method displayed a good linear relationship,
improved extraction recoveries, and satisfied the required
precision and accuracy for the pharmacokinetic study of
ATA (Tables 5-7). The results showed that encapsulation
of ATA in NPs significantly extended the circulation time
of ATA during the test period (Figure 7B). The total area
under the curve (AUC0-24h) and mean retention time (MRT)
of ATA NPs in blood were notably increased compared to
free ATA (Figure 7B and Table 8).
In summary, our study resulted in the successful
preparation of ATA-loaded mPEG-PLGA NPs with
satisfactory properties including valuable EE%,
favorable size, and high stability. The drug efficacy
of ATA NPs was equal to free ATA in vitro, and the
ATA NPs conferred lower toxicity to normal cells and
zebrafish and also prolonged the circulation time of

Synthesis of ATA

ATA in rat blood. To our knowledge, this is the first
study to use nanomization for the improvement of the
bioavailability of the novel anticancer compound ATA.
This study suggests that the nanoparticle encapsulation
of ATA could offer a potential strategy to deliver ATA in
clinical cancer therapy.

TIIA (500 mg), sodium acetate (700 mg), and
anhydrous zinc powder (1.5 g) were mixed with acetic
anhydride (5 mL). The mixture was stirred and refluxed
at 100°C for 3 h, and then filtered. The filtrate was
diluted with water (100 mL) and boiled to remove excess
acetic anhydride. The resulting solution was cooled and
the precipitate was filtered again. This precipitate was
recrystallized twice using 95% ethanol (34 mL) to produce
the final product (approximately 360 mg)[22]. Proton
nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) spectra were
recorded at room temperature with a Bruker spectrometer
operating at 500 MHz and using DMSO-d6 as solvent.
Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra were recorded
with a Perkin-Elmer Spectrum 100 at a resolution of 2
cm−1.

Preparation of ATA NPs
Systematic optimization using orthogonal design
The encapsulation efficiency of ATA and drug
loading were selected as evaluation indices of the
12026

Oncotarget

orthogonal design [29–31]. Three major effective factors
{A: concentration of F68 (%) (B): ratio of mPEG-PLGA:
ATA (m:m), and C: ultrasonic time (min)} associated with
this process were optimized using an orthogonal L9(34) test
design as shown in Table 1. These three factors were tested
at three different levels, and encapsulation efficiency and
drug loading of ATA were chosen as the evaluation indices.

as a dry film was observed by TEM (FEI Tecnai) at an
accelerating voltage of 120 kV.
Thermal analysis (TG/DTA) of ATA NPs
Thermal analyses that include thermogravimetry
(TG) and differential thermal analysis (DTA) were
performed using a Diamond TG/DTA (Perkin Elmer
instrument)[37]. The precision of the thermobalance
in this instrument is 0.0001 mg. Before performing the
experiments, the weight, temperature, and sensitivity
calibrations of the instrument were performed using
calibration sets. The thermal decomposition was
conducted on free ATA, F68, mPEG-PLGA, a physical
mixture of the three compounds, and freeze-dried
ATA NPs. Approximately 2 mg of a vacuum-dried
coal sample of < 200 μm was placed in the sample
crucible. The sample was heated in pure N2 from 30
to 400°C at a heating rate of 10°C/min. Melting points
of the samples were determined from the resultant
thermograms.

Encapsulation efficiency determination
ATA NPs (1 mL) were centrifuged at 500 rpm at
25°C for 5 min. A fixed amount of supernatant was
diluted with methanol to the desired concentration and the
concentration of ATA in the solution was referred to as
the concentration of encapsulated ATA. The concentration
of ATA was measured by RP-HPLC analysis (Shimadzu
LC-20AT pump liquid chromatograph; chromatographic
column: Kromasil 100-5C8, 250 mm × 4.6 mm, 5 μm)
[32–36]. A methanol-H2O (80/20, v:v) mobile phase
system was pumped at a flow rate of 1 mL/min with a
column temperature of 30°C, and the column eluents were
monitored at a wavelength of 254 nm. The percentage of
drug loading (DL%) and encapsulation efficiency (EE%)
was calculated as follows:
DL% = amount of drug in NPs / amount of feeding
polymer
EE% = amount of drug in NPs / amount of feeding
drug

Storage stability and compatible stability of ATA NPs
To determine their storage stability, ATA NPs were
diluted in phosphate buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4) and
incubated at 4°C or 37°C for 1-7 days. The size and zeta
potential of the NPs were measured at designated intervals
during this period. To measure the compatibility-stability,
ATA NPs were added into solutions of 0.9% NaCl or
5% glucose, and incubated at 25°C for 24 h. From all
conditions, 1 mL of suspension was collected for analysis
of size and zeta potential.

Preparation of ATA NPs
Emulsion-solvent evaporation method was used to
prepare the ATA NPs. First, ATA (2.5 mg) and mPEGPLGA (37.5 mg) were dissolved in chloroform (500
μL). The resultant solution was then added into 0.5%
F68 (10 mL) which was dissolved in PBS and treated
with ultrasound (37% strength) for 2.5 min. Finally,
chloroform was removed by rotary evaporation to
obtain ATA NPs. Blank NPs were prepared by the
same method, but without the addition of ATA into the
formulation.

Drug release from ATA NPs
The release of ATA from ATA NPs was investigated
using dialysis and compared with the release of free ATA
in solution [38–41]. Free ATA, or ATA NPs containing an
equal amount of ATA, was mixed with release medium
(6 mL ultra-pure water with 1% SDS) and placed in a
dialysis sack (MWCO 12,000, Sigma). The pocket was
then immersed in release medium (50 mL) with gentle
stirring at 37°C. Samples of medium from outside of the
pocket (2 mL) were taken at the designated time intervals
for analysis, and an equal volume of fresh release medium
was replenished. The amount of released drug was
determined by the RP-HPLC method described in the
section “Pharmacokinetics of ATA NPs in rats” below.
The similarity of release profiles between the free ATA
and ATA NPs were evaluated by the similarity factor (f2)
shown below:

Toxicity evaluation of ATA NPs

or ATA NPs. Free ATA was suspended in a solution of
PEG300: Ethanol: Tween 80 (60:25:15, v:v:v). Free
ATA suspension or ATA NPs were administered at an
equivalent dose of ATA at 8 mg/kg body weight via a
single intravenous injection in the tail vein. At different
time points (15 min, 30 min, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, and 24
h), blood samples (0.3 mL) were collected from the
suborbital vein and put into heparinized tubes. The
blood samples were centrifuged at 3,000 rpm at 4°C
for 10 min to obtain plasma. Then, the samples were
pretreated and injected into RP-HPLC for detection
[30–34]. Microsoft Excel PKSolver was used to analyze
the pharmacokinetic data. All animal studies were
done in accordance with the protocol of ARF SBS NIE
A-0146 AZ approved by the Institutional Animal Care
and Use Committee, Nanyang Technological University,
Singapore.

Effects of free ATA and ATA NPs on cell viability of
MCF-7 cells and HUVEC
The MTT reduction ability was determined
as an index of the metabolic viability, in particular
mitochondrial function, of the cells. Briefly, MCF7 cells or HUVEC were seeded in 96-well plates and
allowed to grow overnight. Free ATA (dissolved in
DMSO, diluted with DMEM), ATA NPs, or blank NPs
were added at different concentrations and the cells were
incubated for 24, 48, and 72 h. MTT solution (10 μL; 5
mg/mL) was added into each well for 4 h. One hundred
microliters of 1% SDS (containing 0.1% concentrated
hydrochloric acid) was then added in each well to
dissolve the formazan crystals. After 8 h, the absorbance
of solubilized MTT formazan products were measured
at 595 nm, and the cell viability was calculated from
the OD value of the test sample and the vehicle control
(untreated cells) using the following equation: cell
viability (%) = ODtest sample /ODvehicle control × 100. The
data obtained in triplicate from three independent
experiments were presented as the mean ± SD.

Sample pretreatment
Before the samples were injected into the
chromatograph, they were subjected to protein
denaturation and precipitation [32–36]. Briefly, acetonitrile
(700 μL) was added to each 300 μL sample to precipitate
the proteins and extract ATA. Samples were vortex mixed
for 15 min and then centrifuged for 10 min at 14,000 rpm
at 4°C. The deproteinized supernatant was recovered and
analyzed immediately by RP-HPLC.

Effects of varying concentrations of free ATA and ATA
NPs on development and heart rate of zebrafish larvae
Male and female zebrafish were bred in separate
tanks. The temperature of water in the tanks was
maintained at 28.5°C and pH 7.2-7.4. After mating, the
selected embryos were collected at 4 hpf and placed in
96-well plates. The chorion surrounding the embryo was
removed enzymatically at 4 hpf following procedures
described in the literature [42–43]. In brief, these embryos
were placed in glass petri dishes containing of fresh water
(25 mL) with pronase (50 μL; 50 mg/mL) for 4-5 min.
Next, the fresh water was decanted and replenished with
fresh E3 zebrafish embryos medium (13.7 mM NaCl, 0.54
mM KCl, 0.025 mM Na2HPO4, 0.044 mM KH2PO4, 0.42
mM NaHCO3, 1.3 mM CaCl2, 1.0 mM MgSO4, and 0.35
mM penicillin and streptomycin; pH adjusted to 7.2).
Various concentrations of free ATA and ATA
NPs were added. The temperature of incubator was
maintained at 28.5°C to ensure the optimal development
of the embryos. Throughout the experiment, incubation
solutions with freshly added ATA were replaced daily.
Images of the zebrafish were captured in order to
document any morphological changes. The heart rate
was also recorded as described previously [44–47].
Twenty zebrafish were used in each experimental group
and the zebrafish experiments were conducted at least
four times.

Analytical method for determination of ATA in rat
plasma and blood
The concentration of ATA in plasma or whole
blood was measured by RP-HPLC analysis as described
above. The standard stock solution of ATA was added
into the plasma or blood at different concentrations and
subjected to sample pretreatment. The calibration graphs
were based on linear regression analysis of the peakarea of ATA versus the concentration of ATA [32–36].
The extraction recoveries of ATA from rat plasma were
determined at the concentrations of 0.0005, 0.01, and 50
μg/mL and from rat blood at the concentrations of 0.1,
5, and 100 μg/mL, using five replicates. The precision
and accuracy of the method were examined at three
concentrations of samples. The intra-day precisions
were evaluated by analyzing five replicate samples in
one day. The analysis was performed on five consecutive
days for the inter-day precision.

Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS
10.0 software. Descriptive data were expressed as
the arithmetic mean value plus or minus the standard
deviation. All quantitative results were obtained from a
minimum of triplicate samples. A t-test was applied to
detect differences between groups. In all evaluations, *p <
0.05 was considered statistically significant.
