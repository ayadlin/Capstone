Abstract

Author Manuscript

A large fraction of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), a non-invasive precursor lesion of invasive
breast cancer, overexpresses the HER2/neu oncogene. The ducts of DCIS are abnormally filled
with cells that evade apoptosis, but the underlying mechanisms remain incompletely understood.
We overexpressed HER2 in mammary epithelial cells and observed growth factor-independent
proliferation. When grown in extracellular matrix as 3- dimensional spheroids, control cells
developed a hollow lumen, but HER2-overexpressing cells populated the lumen by evading
apoptosis. We demonstrate that HER2 overexpression in this cellular model of DCIS drives
transcriptional up-regulation of multiple components of the Notch survival pathway. Importantly,
luminal filling required up-regulation of a signaling pathway comprising Notch3, its cleaved
intracellular domain (NICD) and the transcriptional regulator HES1, resulting in elevated levels of
c-MYC and Cyclin D1. In line with HER2- Notch3 collaboration, drugs intercepting either arm

reverted the DCIS-like phenotype. In addition, we report up-regulation of Notch3 in hyperplastic
lesions of HER2 transgenic animals, as well as an association between HER2 levels and
expression levels of components of the Notch pathway in tumor specimens of breast cancer
patients. Therefore, it is conceivable that the integration of the Notch and HER2 signaling
pathways contributes to the pathophysiology of DCIS.

INTRODUCTION
Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

The mammary gland grows rapidly at puberty to produce an elaborate tree-like structure
composed of an inner layer of luminal cells, which are surrounded by an outer layer of
myoepithelial cells. Later cycles of expansion and involution occur during each menstrual
cycle and - even more dramatically - with each pregnancy (Howlin et al., 2006).
Mechanisms underlying formation of the lumen of mammary ducts include cell divisions
with the metaphase plates organized perpendicular to the apical surface (Jechlinger et al.,
2009), and luminal apoptosis promoted by disengagement of inner cell layers from the
basement membrane (Simpson et al., 2008). However, the exact mechanisms that regulate
duct renewal and apoptosis, as well as their relevance to malignant transformation, remain
incompletely understood. In line with diverse mechanisms and cell type heterogeneity,
human mammary tumors display marked morphological and molecular diversity (Perou et
al., 2000). One aggressive subtype, comprising 20–25% of all invasive ductal carcinomas, is
characterized by amplification of the HER2 gene, resulting in overexpression of the encoded
HER2 oncoprotein (also known as ERBB-2/Neu) (Slamon et al., 1987). Treatment with
Trastuzumab, an antibody specific to HER2, has been shown to improve outcomes for
women with high-risk, early stage or metastatic breast tumors that overexpress HER2
(Ignatiadis et al., 2009; Slamon et al., 2001).

In comparison to invasive lesions, HER2 is overexpressed at a higher frequency in preinvasive lesions, including atypical ductal hyperplasia and DCIS. These lesions are
associated with bypass of apoptosis, increased cellular proliferation and robust filling of the
ductal lumen, without invasion through basement membranes (van de Vijver et al., 1988).
Importantly, HER2 overexpression is associated with an increased propensity of DCIS to
recur after surgical tumor removal. Congruent with poor prognosis, the ligand-less HER2
receptor tyrosine kinase acts as the preferred heterodimerization partner of ligand-bound
members of the ERBB family, namely the EGF-receptor (also called ERBB-1), ERBB-3
(HER3) and ERBB-4 (HER4) (Yarden and Sliwkowski, 2001). Because HER2-containing
heterodimers are less susceptible to negative feedback regulation than homodimers devoid
of HER2, biased heterodimer formation due to HER2 overexpression enhances and prolongs
growth factor signaling. According to another model, HER2 overexpression results in
ligand-independent formation of signaling-competent HER2-HER2 homodimers (Hudziak et
al., 1989; Lonardo et al., 1990). Once activated by dimerization, HER2 can instigate a
number of potent signaling pathways, including the mitogen activated protein kinase

(MAPK) pathway and the PI3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathway. It has previously been reported
that HER2 induces luminal filling by promoting survival of luminal cells through the PI3KAKT axis (Debnath et al., 2002; Debnath et al., 2003; Schafer et al., 2009). In addition,
HER2 disrupts the architecture of the glandular epithelium by interacting with the cell
polarity machinery (Aranda et al., 2006; Muthuswamy et al., 2001). In contrast to the wealth
of knowledge on biochemical pathways, the transcriptional programs launched by HER2 to
enhance luminal filling at early stages of mammary tumorigenesis are less understood.

Author Manuscript

Another signal transduction pathway critical for breast cancer progression, comprises Notch
family receptors and their membrane-bound ligands (Yin et al., 2010). The family includes
four conserved transmembrane receptors (Notch1 through Notch4) and five surfacelocalized
ligands (Jagged1, Jagged2, Delta-like1 through Delta-like3), which play fundamental roles
in self-renewal and proliferation of progenitor and adult stem cells of the mammary gland.
For instance, Notch1 and Notch3 regulate expression of c-MYC and Cyclin D1 to promote
cell proliferation (Cohen et al., 2010; Palomero et al., 2006). Notch signaling is activated
through receptor-ligand interactions between neighboring cells, resulting in successive
proteolytic cleavages of Notch proteins by the tumor necrosis factor converting enzyme
(TACE; also called ADAM17) and the γ-secretase complex. This releases the Notch
intracellular domain (NICD) from the plasma membrane, permitting its translocation into
the nucleus and formation of a trimeric transcriptional activator complex with a DNAbinding protein, CSL (also termed CBF-1 and RBP-Jκ), and Mastermind. The complex
induces transcription of the HERP and HES gene families, thereby regulating the expression
of multiple genes involved in cell growth, differentiation and survival (Iso et al., 2003).

The involvement of Notch signaling in mammary gland tumorigenesis is incompletely
understood. The survival-promoting activity of the pathway likely underlay the observed
ability of Notch family members to promote mammary tumors (Imatani and Callahan, 2000;
Stylianou et al., 2006). In humans, high co-expression of Notch1 and its ligand, JAG-1,
associates with poor overall survival of breast cancer patients (Reedijk et al., 2005), and an
in vitro study implicated a Notch1-to-STAT3 pathway in mammary hyperproliferation
(Mazzone et al., 2010). Although no mutant forms of Notch or aberrant components of the
downstream pathway have been reported in mammary tumors, according to one report
frequent activation of the pathway occurs in tumors that have lost negative regulation of
Notch by the cell fate determinant Numb (Pece et al., 2004). Herein, we associate a
Notchinduced pathway with overexpression of HER2. Because HER2 is frequently
overexpressed in DCIS, and these lesions are characterized by the absence of cell death
within their lumen, we characterized DCIS-like three-dimensional (3D) spheroids of
mammary cells overexpressing HER2. Our results attribute luminal filling to the ability of
an overexpressed HER2 to transcriptionally up-regulate several components of the Notch
pathway. In line with in vivo relevance of the 3D model, we report up-regulation of Notch3
in pre-invasive lesions of a HER2-driven animal model of breast cancer. Moreover, we show
association of expression of several Notch pathway components with HER2 expression in
patients with invasive breast cancer. Our results imply that the uncovered HER2-Notch3
collaboration is required during early steps of mammary tumorigenesis.

RESULTS
Ectopic overexpression of HER2 confers autonomous growth to human mammary
epithelial cells

Author Manuscript

Previous studies modeled DCIS by overexpressing fusion proteins, comprising HER2
(intracellular domain) and the ectodomain of the receptor for the nerve growth factor, in
MCF10A immortalized human mammary cells (Debnath et al., 2002; Muthuswamy et al.,
2001). To model the effects of wild type, full-length HER2 on DCIS, we constructed
MCF10A cells ectopically overexpressing the oncoprotein (C-R. Pradeep et al., manuscript
submitted). Briefly, cells were stably infected with retroviral particles encoding HER2 and
IRES-GFP (hereafter denoted MCF10A-HER2 cells) or IRES-GFP alone (hereafter
MCF10A; (Ueda et al, 2004)). Immunoblotting of cell lysates obtained before or after
stimulation with growth factors (EGF or neuregulin; NRG1-beta), confirmed that HER2
overexpression results in increased autophosphorylation (Lonardo et al., 1990),
transphosphorylation of EGFR and ligand-independent activation of ERK. In addition, on
growth factor stimulation we confirmed enhanced and prolonged activation of the ERK
pathway in HER2-overexpressors (Figure 1A) (Pinkas-Kramarski et al, 1996; Worthylake et
al., 1999). These effects on signaling kinetics translated to enhanced cellular proliferation:
unlike MCF10A cells, whose proliferation rates depended on growth factors, the enhanced
proliferation rates of MCF10A-HER2 cells were not affected by growth factors (Figure 1B).
An independent bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation assay detected an EGF-induced
three-fold enhancement of BrdU signals in MCF10A cells, unlike MCF10A-HER2 cells that
displayed high BrdU signals independent of EGF. Thus, when overexpressed in normal
mammary cells, HER2 confers high phosphorylation signals and autonomous cell growth,
independent of growth factors.

HER2 transcriptionally induces multiple components of the Notch pathway

Author Manuscript

To resolve molecular bases underlying the growth autonomy conferred by HER2, we
employed a three-dimensional (3D) culture system (reviewed in (Debnath and Brugge,
2005)). When grown in a preparation of extracellular matrix (Matrigel™), MCF10A cells
form hollow spheroids, which were reported to undergo luminal filling when an ectopically
expressed chimeric HER2 was forced to form homodimers (Muthuswamy et al., 2001). Our
MCF10A-HER2 cells overexpressing wild type HER2 similarly exhibited luminal filling,
even in the absence of further treatments. Notably the MCF10A-HER2 spheroids retained an
intact outer structure without any evidence of invasion (data not shown and Figure 2D, left
panels). To identify the gene expression programs that promote luminal filling, RNA was
extracted from 3D structures and hybridized to oligonucleotide microarrays. As expected,
analyses of mRNAs significantly altered in MCF10A-HER2 cells revealed up-regulation of
cell proliferation modules (C-R. Pradeep et al., manuscript submitted). In addition, we noted
persistent up-regulation of several components of the Notch pathway, including two
receptors and three JAG/DLL ligands, as well as ADAM17 and Presenilin1, proteases that
cleave and activate Notch (Figure 2A). Congruent with simultaneous, multi-site induction of
the Notch pathway, two prototypic target genes of the pathway, HES1 and HES2, also
displayed elevated expression. We confirmed transcriptional induction of several
components by using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR; Figure 2B), and by employing

a mouse Notch3 promoter-reporter luciferase vector. The vector was co-transfected, along
with HER2, into two different mammary epithelial cell lines, which were subsequently
incubated in the presence or absence of Trastuzumab. The results show that ectopic
expression of HER2 remarkably induced Notch3 promoter activity in both cell lines
(Supplementary Figure S1). Moreover, a monoclonal antibody against HER2 (Trastuzumab)
partially inhibited the HER2- induced activation of the Notch3 promoter. Next, by applying
a MEK-specific inhibitor (U0126) we found that the MAPK-ERK pathway, the major
downstream effector of HER2, contributes to the transcriptional induction of the Notch
pathway in lumen-filled spheroids (Figure 2C).

On losing contact with their extracellular matrix, luminal mammary cells, as well as
MCF10A cells grown in spheroids, undergo anoikis, resulting in lumen formation, unless
oncogenes like HER2, which enhances proliferation and inhibits apoptosis, are activated
(Debnath et al., 2002; Simpson et al., 2008). Consistent with the possibility that the bypass
of anoikis is mediated by the Notch pathway, we found that MCF10A-HER2 cells strongly
expressed Notch3, whereas the hollow spheroids formed by MCF10A cells exhibited
relatively weak expression (Figure 2D, right panels). Western blotting of cell lysates from
spheroids confirmed that Notch3 and its active cleavage product, NICD, were expressed at
higher levels in MCF10A-HER2 cells compared to MCF10A cells (Figure 2E), and
fractionation indicated that both forms were present in the cytoplasm, but only NICD
partitioned with the nuclear fraction of MCF10A-HER2 cells (Supplementary Figure S2).
Interestingly, treatment with Trastuzumab almost abolished the nuclear species.
Immunostaining localized Notch3 to the cytoplasm of MCF10A cells, but specifically
detected a fraction of Notch3 within nuclei of MCF10A-HER2 cells (Figure 2F). In
conclusion, HER2 overexpression leads to induction of multiple components of the Notch
survival pathway, and this associates with nuclear localization of Notch3, raising the
possibility that Notch mediates the effects of HER2 on luminal filling.
Notch3 and DLL1 promote survival and proliferation of HER2-overexpressing cells

Author Manuscript

To test whether Notch3 is required for survival and proliferation, we stably reduced Notch3
expression by applying specific shRNAs (Figure 3A). Two out of four different shRNAs we
tested effectively reduced Notch3 expression in MCF10A-HER2 cells (the results obtained
with each shRNA are presented in Figure 3 and in Supplementary Figure S3). When
analyzed in monolayers, Notch3 knockdown significantly decreased proliferation of
MCF10A-HER2 cells, such that they displayed growth rates similar to MCF10A cells
(Figure 3B). To analyze the effect of Notch3 knockdown in 3D cultures, we applied two
distinct approaches. The first, a suspension culture in the polyHEMA polymer (Dontu et al.,
2003), revealed that neither shControl- nor shNotch3- expressing MCF10A cells formed
spheroids. In agreement with the ability of HER2 to confer autonomous growth, MCF10AHER2 cells formed large spheroids, with Notch3 knockdown significantly reducing both
their number and size (Figure 3C). The second protocol, spheroids grown in Matrigel,
indicated that unlike MCF10A cells, which developed hollow spheroids by day 8, HER2overexpressing cells evolved lumen-filled spheroids. Notch3 knockdown largely reversed
the HER2-induced phenotype (Figure 3D). Staining of spheroids at day 6 for the cleaved
form of Caspase-3 revealed luminal activity of this apoptosis-executing protease in

MCF10A spheroids, as well as in Notch3 knocked-down MCF10A-HER2 spheroids, in line
with the notion that the Notch pathway enables HER2- overexpressors to evade anoikis
(Figure 3D). In conclusion, three different cellular approaches indicated that the Notch
pathway underlies the effects of HER2 on proliferation and survival of mammary cells.
Along with Notch3 up-regulation, overexpression of HER2 up-regulates the ligand DLL1
(Figs. 2A and 2B). Low concentrations of a recombinant form of DLL1 enhanced cleavage
of Notch3, and congruently increased proliferation of MCF10A-HER2 cells (Supplementary
Fig. S4). However, no comparable mitogenesis was observed with the parental MCF10A
cells, a difference that was reflected also in the ability to support spheroid formation.
Conceivably, the observed HER2-induced up-regulation of several components of the Notch
pathway sensitizes mammary cells to DLL1, as well as to other Notch agonists.

Author Manuscript

Notch3-induced c-MYC, Cyclin D1 and AKT activity underlie the growth-promoting effect of
HER2
Previous studies implicated c-MYC and Cyclin D1 in Notch-induced growth and survival
signals (Cohen et al., 2010; Palomero et al., 2006). Likewise, our analyses revealed much
higher expression of both c-MYC and Cyclin D1 in MCF10A-HER2 spheroids, relative to
MCF10A spheroids (Figure 4A), and immunoblotting confirmed these differences at the
protein level (Figure 4B). Inhibition of either HER2 signaling (using Trastuzumab) or Notch
signaling (using an inhibitor of γ-secretase; GSI) reduced c-MYC and Cyclin D1 protein
levels, with maximal reduction occurring upon treatment with the combination of drugs
(Figure 4B). In the same vein, immunoblot analysis confirmed that knockdown of Notch3 in
MCF10A-HER2 cells decreased the expression of both Cyclin D1 and c-MYC (Figure 4C).

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

To substantiate the conclusion that transcriptional induction of Notch3 and its regulated
proteolytic cleavage suffice to induce Cyclin D1 and c-MYC, we ectopically expressed
NICD in two non-HER2 overexpressing mammary epithelial cell lines, MDAMB231 and
MCF10A. As expected, this resulted in concomitant up-regulation of c-MYC and Cyclin D1
(Figure 4D) (Palomero et al., 2006). Next, by using siRNA oligonucleotides, we silenced the
expression of the transcriptional repressor HES1, a well-established target of NICD, in two
HER2 overexpressing lines, BT474 and MCF10A-HER2. HES1 knockdown enhanced the
expression of the lipid phosphatase PTEN, in line with previous reports (Palomero et al.,
2007; Whelan et al., 2007), and accordingly diminished the activating phosphorylation of
AKT on serine-473 (Figure 4E). As a complementary approach, we stably overexpressed
AKT2 or c-MYC in MCF10A-HER2 cells, and treated the respective spheroids with GSI
(Supplementary Figures S5A and S5B). Unlike parental MCF10A-HER2 cells, which
displayed luminal apoptosis, both transfected lines evaded apoptosis. Taken together, these
results implicate up-regulation of c-MYC and Cyclin D1, along with enhanced activation of
AKT, in a HER2-Notch survival pathway of mammary cells.
To explore potential therapeutic implications, we treated MCF10A-HER2 spheroids with
Trastuzumab and GSI. Whereas either drug alone enhanced apoptosis of luminal cells in
MCF10A-HER2 spheroids, their combination almost completely abolished formation of
filled lumina (Figure 4F). Similarly, when applied on MCF10A-HER2 spheroids,
pathwayspecific inhibitors targeting MEK (U0126), c-MYC (10058-F4) or PI3K-AKT

(LY-294002) markedly enhanced Caspase-3 activation, resulting in significant inhibition of
luminal filling (Supplementary Figures S5C and S5D). In conclusion, the HER2-to-Notch
axis is linked to an apoptosis evasion mechanism that entails c-MYC and Cyclin D1, along
with coupling of HER2 to AKT activation.
Notch3 expression correlates with HER2 levels in an animal model and in human breast
cancer specimens

Author Manuscript

Studies using transgenic mice demonstrated that overexpression of an activated form of
Notch1 or Notch3 in the mammary gland results in increased formation of mammary tumors
(Hu et al, 2006). Our results using 2D and 3D models of HER2-overexpressing DCIS
propose that HER2 activation harnesses the Notch pathway to accelerate cellular
proliferation, and hence may support mammary tumors in vivo. To test this prediction, we
stained for Notch3 mammary glands of transgenic mice carrying an activated form of the
HER2/neu oncogene, under the control of the mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) long
terminal repeat (Bouchard et al., 1989; Tekmal et al., 2007). Indeed, hyperplastic lesions,
which frequently develop in the mammary glands of MMTV-HER2/neu transgenic mice,
exhibited homogeneous weak to moderate immunohistochemical staining for Notch3, which
was accentuated in cells facing the ductal lumen (Figure 5A). Conversely, normal mammary
glands of non-HER2 transgenic mice from the same strain displayed a heterogeneous
staining pattern, with Notch3 expression mostly confined to small ducts (Figure 5A), likely
reflecting a role in the transition from small to mature ducts.

Author Manuscript

To determine the relevance of our findings to human breast cancer, we analyzed two clinical
datasets (Desmedt et al., 2007; Schmidt et al., 2008), each derived from oligonucleotide
microarray analyses of approximately 200 breast cancer patients, for possible associations
between HER2 mRNA expression and presence of components of the Notch pathway. In
line with our in vitro expression data (Figure 2B), Notch3 along with presenilin and HES1
presented highly significant correlations with HER2 expression (Table 1). Interestingly, our
analyses found weak negative correlation between HER2 and Notch1, although coexpression of JAG-1 and Notch1 occurs in aggressive human breast tumors, which do not
belong to the HER2 subtype (Reedijk et al., 2005).

Author Manuscript

In order to confirm the association between HER2 and Notch3 at the protein level in clinical
specimens, we used reverse-phase protein arrays (RPPA) (Hennessy et al., 2010). Analyses
of mammary tumors from two independent patient cohorts (approximately 100 patients per
cohort) confirmed significant correlation between the phosphorylated, active form of HER2
(p1248HER2) and Notch3 (cohort 1: r=0.43, p=1.55E-05; cohort 2: r=0.23, p=2.58E-02;
Figure 5B). Moreover, in both data sets Notch3 protein levels also significantly correlated
with EGFR expression (r=0.37 or 0.28; p<1.00E-02 for both). Individual patientrelated data
were available for the second cohort, for which subgroup analyses revealed correlation of
Notch3 with levels of HER2 (r=0.31, p=3.16E-02) and p1248HER2 (r=0.34, p=1.80E-02) in
48 patients with poorly differentiated tumors. However, no such correlation was observed in
moderately or well-differentiated tumors (HER2 r=0.03, p1248HER2 r=0.18, p>5.00E-02
for both). On the other hand, patient subgroups defined by age, menopausal status or
expression of the estrogen receptor (ER) and/or the progesterone receptor (PR) did not

exhibit differences with respect to the correlation between Notch3 and either HER2 or
p1248HER2 (data not shown).
In summary, our in vitro results, animal studies and clinical data lend collective support to
an hypothesis arguing that the non-invasive cell proliferation associated with HER2overexpressing mammary lesions, such as DCIS, is mediated, by the Notch pathway.
Apparently, by activating proliferation and survival pathways comprising c-MYC, Cyclin D,
and AKT, Notch signaling mediates filling of mammary ducts with HER2-overexpressing
cells. Future studies will examine the ability of combination therapy targeting both HER2
and Notch to delay the putative transition from DCIS to infiltrating ductal carcinoma
overexpressing the HER2 oncoprotein.

DISCUSSION
Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

The evolutionary conserved Notch signaling pathway is considered a critical regulator of
cell fate decisions in embryonic development, including hematopoiesis, neurogenesis and
development of several organs, such as the mammary gland (Liu et al., 2010). For example,
proliferation and differentiation of mammary stem cells towards luminal and myoepithelial
cell lineages are controlled in large part by the Notch pathway (Shackleton et al., 2006;
Stingl et al., 2006). Thus, ectopic activation of Notch signaling commits mammary stem
cells to the luminal lineage, as well as enhances proliferation of luminal cells, leading
ultimately to their transformation (Bouras et al., 2008). On the other hand, inhibition of
Notch signaling enhances self-renewal, rather than differentiation, of mammary stem cells.
It is, therefore, not surprising that the Notch pathway is amply employed by tumor cells to
thrust their survival and growth. Whereas in small cell lung cancer, Notch may act as a
tumor suppressive pathway (Sriuranpong et al., 2001), gain-of-function mutations and a
chromosomal translocation leading to constitutive activation of Notch1 were identified in
human T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ellisen et al., 1991; Weng et al., 2004), gene
amplification of Notch3 was detected in ovarian cancer (Nakayama et al., 2007), and
relatively low levels of the Notch antagonist Numb were noted in breast tumors (Pece et al.,
2004). Our study unveils yet another mechanism that harnesses Notch signaling to promote
malignant growth. Coordinated transcriptional induction of several Notch pathway
components (summarized in Figure 5C) appears essential for HER2-induced enhancement
of proliferation and survival of mammary epithelial cells. Importantly, the 3D experimental
model we employed proposes that the HER2-to-Notch pathway, although robustly
promoting growth factor-independent cell proliferation, is unable to induce basement
membrane breakdown and subsequent invasive growth. Presumably, additional insults are
needed to unleash the migratory potential of HER2-initiated cells. Interestingly, stimulation
with EGF, which promotes formation of heterodimers of HER2 with the EGF-receptor, was
reported to be sufficient for the emergence of an invasive phenotype of HER2overexpressing spheroids (Zhan et al., 2006).
Previous lines of evidence are consistent with our conclusion that HER2 overexpression in
the mammary epithelium is functionally linked to the Notch pathway. For example, a recent
study found that enhanced expression of Notch1 represents an early transforming event in
both a murine model of DCIS and in human breast tumors (Zardawi et al., 2010).

Interestingly, a positive feedback loop may escalate HER2 and Notch expression in tumors;
on the one hand HER2’s promoter contains a Notch-binding sequence (Chen et al., 1997),
and, on the other hand, overexpression of HER2 transcriptionally induces the Notch
pathway, as we demonstrate in this study. Another emerging feature entails involvement of
the HER2-Notch pathway in breast cancer stem cells. Notch-mediated up-regulation of
HER2 enhances the tumor-initiating potential of mammary cells (Clemenz and Osipo,
2009), whereas Notch-driven HER2-overexpressing breast cancer cells show characteristics
of tumor initiating cells that can be inhibited by Trastuzumab (Magnifico et al., 2009).
Interestingly, HER2 overexpression increases the proportion of stem/progenitor cells as
demonstrated by the expression of the stem cell marker aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH)
(Korkaya et al., 2008). The effects of HER2 overexpression on breast cancer stem cells are
blocked by Trastuzumab in sensitive, but not resistant, cell lines, an effect mediated by the
PI3K-to-AKT pathway. It is notable that HER2 cannot directly recruit PI3K, hence it must
engage a surrogate receptor, such as ERBB-3/HER3 (Prigent and Gullick, 1994; Wallasch et
al., 1995). The results presented herein delineate an alternative mechanism, analogous to the
mode identified in leukemia (Palomero et al., 2008): Notch activation reduces PTEN
expression, and thereby elevates levels of 3′ phosphoinositides necessary for AKT
stimulation.

Beyond the understanding that two oncogenic pathways, HER2 and Notch, jointly constitute
a novel module that likely underlies the luminal filling characteristics of DCIS, our study
bears potential clinical implications. Two implications are worth mentioning, especially in
light of the current debate pertaining to relative risks and optimal treatment of this
noninvasive neoplasm. For one, co-incidence of HER2 and active Notch may identify a
group of DCIS patients who are at increased risk of relapse after surgery. Secondly, the
ongoing interactions between HER2 and Notch in later stages of tumor development, as
pointed out in our study, highlight the potential of treatment strategies that combine antiHER2 antibodies with Notch antagonists (such as GSI) or with PI3K/AKT kinase inhibitors.
Such combinations displayed effectiveness in our 3D model system, hence may prove useful
in clinical settings.

Retroviral infection

Author Manuscript

c-MYC-tagged HER2 cDNA cloned in a retroviral expression vector (pBMN-IRES-EGFP)
was provided by Dr. Carlos L. Arteaga (Vanderbilt University School of Medicine,
Nashville, TN). pBMN-HER2-IRES-EGFP or pBMN-IRES-EGFP (control) were cotransfected with a retroviral packaging plasmid, pSV-ψ-env-MLV (provided by Dr. Jane
Burns, University of California, San Diego, CA) into 293T cells using FuGENE (Roche
Applied Science, Indianapolis). Virus-containing medium was collected 48–72 hours later
and passed through a 45-μm filter. MCF10A cells were transduced with control or HER2encoding retroviral vectors and cells stably expressing GFP after 5 passages were selected
by flow cytometry.
Immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy

Author Manuscript

Acinar structures were fixed on glass slides for 10 minutes in methanol-acetone (1:1;
−20°C), and air-dried before blocking for 1 hour at room temperature in
immunofluorescence buffer (130mM NaCl, 7mM Na2HPO4, 3.5mM NaH2PO4, 7.7mM
NaN3, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 0.2% Triton X-100 and 0.05% Tween-20 and 10% goat
serum). Secondary blocking was performed for 30 minutes in immunofluorescence buffer
containing goat anti-mouse F(ab’)2 fragment (20 μg/ml). The primary antibody was
incubated at 4°C for 15–18 hours. Secondary antibodies conjugated to fluorescent dyes and
diluted in blocking buffer were subsequently incubated for 60 minutes at room temperature.
Images presented are representative of three or more independent experiments.
Real-time quantitative PCR and oligonucleotide microarray hybridization

Author Manuscript

Total RNA was isolated using a Versagene kit (Gentra Systems, Minneapolis) and reverse
transcribed with random hexamers (SuperScript II first-strand synthesis kit, InVitrogen,
California). Real-time PCR analysis was performed using SYBR Green I (Applied
Biosystems) in triplicates, and the results were normalized to beta-2 microglobulin. For
oligonucleotide microarray hybridization, RNA (10μg) was labeled, fragmented and
hybridized to Affymetrix HuGENE 1.0 ST arrays. After scanning of the arrays, we
calculated gene expression values and normalized the results using the expression console of
Affymetrix (RMA normalization). The GEO code for the data: GSE18938, and the link:
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?token=vjgzdemksqmgqpi&acc=GSE18938
Cell cultures in polyHEMA
Cells were cultured in polyHEMA as previously described (Dontu et al., 2003).
