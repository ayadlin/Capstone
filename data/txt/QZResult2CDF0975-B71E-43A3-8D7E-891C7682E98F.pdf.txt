Abstract
The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)–specific tyrosine kinase inhibitor gefitinib may provide dramatic clinical
responses in some patients with pulmonary adenocarcinoma
carrying activating mutations of the EGFR. However, prolonged administration of gefitinib may eventually induce
acquired resistance in such patients. To gain insight into the
mechanisms of this phenomenon, we placed PC-9, a cell line
derived from pulmonary adenocarcinoma that has a 15-bp
deletion in EGFR exon 19, under the continuous selective
pressure of low levels of gefitinib without any mutagen, and
established a subline that was able to grow in the presence of
2 Mmol/L of gefitinib (designated RPC-9). In this cell line,
about half of the reverse transcription-PCR products from
mutated EGFR also carried an additional mutation (T790M).
In keeping with the proposed role of T790M in abrogating
gefitinib binding with EGFR, gefitinib-treated RPC-9 hardly
displayed any decrease in the constitutive phosphorylation of
EGFR, Akt, or Erk1/2 unlike in PC-9 cells. Interestingly,
transfection of the EGFR carrying only a 15-bp deletion
reversed the resistance to gefitinib in RPC-9 cells. Thus, the
balance of expression levels between gefitinib-sensitive or
gefitinib-resistant EGFR may govern the response to gefitinib
in lung cancer. [Cancer Res 2007;67(16):7807–14]

Introduction
The selective inhibitors of the epidermal growth factor receptor
(EGFR) tyrosine kinase, gefitinib (Iressa, ZD1839) and erlotinib
(Tarceva), prevent binding of ATP to the ATP-binding pocket of
the EGFR in a competitive manner, thereby leading to the loss of
catalytic activity (1, 2). They have provided dramatic clinical
responses and even survival benefits for a subset of patients with
pulmonary adenocarcinoma (3–10). Importantly, somatic mutations have been discovered in the kinase domain of EGFR in cancer
cells of these non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients (3–5).

Deletional mutations in exon 19 and substitution of leucine with
arginine at codon 858 (L858R) account for f90% of the mutations
(2, 11, 12). Thus, these mutations seem to sensitize the cancer
cells strongly to the growth-suppressive effects of the EGFR
inhibitors. Of note, these patients are often never-smokers and
females (9, 11, 12), and people with East Asian ethnicity carry the
mutations in the lung cancer more often than Caucasians (13).
Not unexpectedly, the mutated EGFR is oncogenic, and is crucial
for the maintenance of the tumor, as shown by transgenic mice
studies (14, 15). The mutations render the EGFR tyrosine kinase
constitutively active, although they still respond to ligands such as
EGF (16, 17). In physiologic settings, activation of the EGFR is
accompanied by ligand-induced homodimerization or heterodimerization with ErbB family members, leading to the active
conformation of the kinase. Structural studies have indicated that
EGFR normally remains in an autoinhibited inactive conformation,
which is maintained by intramolecular interaction between the
activation loop and the aC helix (18–20). Given the location of the
mutations within the activation loop (L858R) or adjacent to aC
helix (deletion), the autoinhibition is likely to be disrupted by the
mutations, leading to the active conformation.
The dramatic clinical efficacy of the EGFR inhibitors in some
NSCLC patients carrying the activating mutations tells us two
things. First, the growth and survival of the NSCLC cells can be
exquisitely dependent on the signal generated by EGFR, which is
abrogated by the treatment. Second, the mutated EGFR is
particularly susceptible to the inhibitors compared with wild-type
EGFR. Indeed, gefitinib binds 20-fold more tightly to the L858R
mutant EGFR compared with the wild-type receptor (20).
Although the tumors carrying these mutations display response
rates to gefitinib as high as 80%, the cancer cells eventually become
resistant to the treatment, and the median duration of response is
typically 9 to 10 months (21, 22). This acquired resistance has been
associated with a secondary mutation, T790M, in EGFR exon 20
(23–25). This situation is analogous to those observed in Bcr-Abl in
imatinib-resistant chronic myelogenous leukemia (26). EGFR
carrying both activating mutation and T790M is resistant to
inhibition by gefitinib (25, 27), and gefitinib-sensitive NSCLC cell
lines can be rendered resistant to gefitinib when introduced with
EGFR carrying T790M (28). Furthermore, structural modeling
suggests that T790M can abrogate the binding of gefitinib or erlotinib
with the ATP-binding pocket of the EGFR kinase domain (28).
However, it is currently unclear whether the T790M mutation
provides a universal explanation for the secondary resistance to
gefitinib or erlotinib. Not all tumors that acquired resistance have
been shown to harbor T790M-positive cells, and it is often difficult
to detect a small number of cells with the T790M mutation (24).

Cancer Research

The biological meaning of the T790M mutation is further
complicated by the observation that some cancer cells might have
the mutation even before the treatment (29, 30), and that a family
with multiple cases of NSCLC is found to carry this mutation in the
germ line (31). Furthermore, many factors other than T790M have
been reported to affect gefitinib sensitivity of the cancer cells. For
example, activation of downstream signaling by loss of PTEN (32),
or expression of activated Ras (33), phosphoinositide-3-kinase
(PI3K) or Akt (28) may bypass the requirement of EGFR signaling,
leading to gefitinib resistance.
To gain insight about potential mechanisms of acquired
resistance to EGFR inhibitors, we established a gefitinib-resistant
NSCLC cell line termed RPC-9 from PC-9 cells (34), which are
highly gefitinib-sensitive and have a 15-bp deletion in EGFR exon
19 (35). We found the T790M mutation in RPC-9 cells, and
consistent with this, gefitinib treatment could not significantly
decrease the levels of phosphorylation of EGFR as well as
downstream effectors Akt and Erk1/2 in RPC-9. We also found
diminished expression of ErbB3 in RPC-9 cells together with
an altered signal transduction pathway to PI3K, however, this is
unlikely to contribute to resistance because ectopic expression of
ErbB3 did not revert the phenotype. Interestingly, introduction of
the EGFR carrying only a 15-bp deletion restored sensitivity to
gefitinib in RPC-9 cells. Finally, we provide evidence that a minor
population with the T790M mutation gradually became dominant
during a 2-month course of in vitro gefitinib treatment.

Materials and Methods
Establishment of the gefitinib-resistant subline from PC-9 cells.
Human NSCLC cell line PC-9 was derived from an untreated Japanese
patient with pulmonary adenocarcinoma that carried an in-frame deletion
in EGFR exon 19 (delE746-A750; ref. 36). PC-9 cells were cultured at 37.0jC
with 5% CO2 in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal
bovine serum. To establish a gefitinib-resistant subline, the cells were
treated with 0.01 Amol/L of gefitinib, which was lower than the IC50 of PC-9,
and the concentration was increased in a stepwise manner. After eight
passages (f2 months), the cells were able to grow in 1 Amol/L of gefitinib.
The cells had been continuously subcultured with 1 to 2 Amol/L of gefitinib
for an additional 6 months, and then we did a single-cell cloning and
established the gefitinib-resistant cell line (RPC-9).
Antibodies. Rabbit antisera against EGFR, phospho-specific EGFR
(pY1068), Erk1/2, phospho-Erk (pT202/pY204), phospho-specific Akt
(pSer473), and total Akt were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology.
Another polyclonal anti-EGFR (SC-03) antibody was obtained from Santa
Cruz Biotechnology. Polyclonal antibodies against ErbB2, or PI3K p85a, and
the anti-phosphotyrosine 4G10 or anti-ErbB3 monoclonal antibodies were
purchased from Upstate Biotechnology. Anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal
antibody was from Sigma.
3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay.
Growth inhibition was measured by a modified 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay (Cell Counting Kit-8;
Dojindo). Briefly, the cells were plated on 96-well plates at a density of
f3,000 cells per well, and exposed to gefitinib for 96 h. Each assay was done
in quadruplicate, and the mean and the SD were calculated.
Cell cycle analysis. To analyze the cell cycle profile, trypsinized cells were
fixed in 70% ethanol overnight, and stained with propidium iodide. Samples
were analyzed on a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson).
Sequencing of EGFR gene and mutant-enriched PCR assay for
T790M. The exons encoding the intracellular domain of EGFR were
amplified from genomic DNA and directly sequenced. Alternatively, cDNA
was synthesized and part of the kinase domain was amplified and
sequenced. In some cases, the PCR products were cloned, and inserts were
amplified from colonies and directly sequenced. The mutant-enriched PCR

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (16). August 15, 2007

analysis was done to detect low-frequency T790M mutation as described in
ref. (30), with some modifications. Briefly, PCR was carried out using 100 ng
of genomic DNA and primers ( forward, 5¶-ACTGACGTGCCTCTCCCTCC-3¶;
reverse, 5¶-CGAAGGGCATGAGCCGC-3¶), then the products were digested
with BstUI to get rid of the wild-type products. After the second round of
PCR using forward primer (5¶-CCTCCAGGAAGCCTACGTGA-3¶) and the
reverse primer (the same one used in the first round of PCR), the products
were directly sequenced.
Western blot analysis and immunoprecipitation. Cells were lysed
in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer [1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS,
50 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mmol/L NaCl, 1 mmol/L EDTA, 1 mmol/L
EGTA, 10 mmol/L h-glycerol-phosphate, 10 mmol/L NaF, 1 mmol/L Naorthovanadate, containing protease inhibitor tablet (Roche)] and were
briefly sonicated. For immunoprecipitation, the cells were lysed in 0.1%
Triton buffer [0.1% Triton X-100, 20 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mmol/L
NaCl, 1 mmol/L EDTA, 1 mmol/L EGTA, 10 mmol/L h-glycerol-phosphate,
10 mmol/L NaF, 1 mmol/L Na-orthovanadate, containing protease
inhibitors], subsequently sonicated and incubated with an appropriate
antibody overnight at 4jC. The immunoprecipitates were collected using
Protein G beads (Pierce). Proteins were separated by electrophoresis on
polyacrylamide gels, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and probed
with specific antibodies followed by detection with enhanced chemiluminescence plus (GE Healthcare Biosciences).
Ectopic expression of EGFR and ErbB3. For retroviral transduction,
human EGFR carrying the 15-bp deletion tagged with COOH-terminal FLAG
epitope or human ErbB3 (kindly provided by Dr. Shigeki Higashiyama,
Ehime University) was subcloned into pMMP-IRES-puro (kindly provided by
Dr. Toshiyasu Taniguchi, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center) or pMX-GFP
vector (kindly provided by Dr. Toshio Kitamura, University of Tokyo),
respectively. To make ecotropic retrovirus, the retroviral plasmid was
transfected into PlatE cells (kindly provided Dr. Toshio Kitamura) using
LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen). After 48 h, the culture supernatants were
transferred to the target cell culture, which had been transiently transfected
with MCAT-1 (the receptor for ecotropic retrovirus) expression vector
(kindly provided by Dr. James Cunningham, Harvard Medical School) 1 day
before the transduction. Transduced cells were selected using puromycin
(2 Ag/mL) or the GFP-positive cell population was sorted using FACSAria
(Becton Dickinson).
EGFR copy number. Comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) was
carried out using bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) microarray
GSP-Array530 (GSP Lab Inc.). Genomic DNA was extracted from PC-9
and RPC-9, and was compared with normal human genomic DNA by CGH.

Results
Gefitinib-resistant PC-9 cells emerged during chronic
gefitinib treatment. To create a model system for studying
mechanisms of acquired gefitinib resistance in NSCLC, we
established a resistant subline designated RPC-9 from PC-9 cells
as described in Materials and Methods. The IC50 was f8 Amol/L in
RPC-9 cells for cell growth inhibition as measured by MTT assay
(Fig. 1A), which was a 400-fold decrease in gefitinib sensitivity
compared with parental PC-9 cells (IC50, 0.02 Amol/L). The
decreased sensitivity did not recover even in cells that were kept
in culture for >1 year without gefitinib (RPC-9R, Fig. 1A).
Proliferation of RPC-9 cells was slightly faster than parental PC-9
cells (Fig. 1B). There was no morphologic difference between the
two under gefitinib-free conditions (Fig. 1C). Following 72-h culture
in the presence of gefitinib, PC-9 cells became rounded and shrunk,
and detached from the bottom of the dish. Cell cycle analysis by
propidium iodide staining revealed that gefitinib treatment
resulted in G1 cell cycle arrest and an increased fraction of cells
with sub-G1 DNA content in PC-9 cells. However, RPC-9 cells were
not affected at all by the same treatment in either morphology or
cell cycle analysis (Fig. 1D). We also found that RPC-9 cells were

strongly resistant to another tyrosine kinase inhibitor, ZD6474
(IC50, 0.1 Amol/L in PC-9 versus >5 Amol/L in RPC-9), which has
dual specificity with EGFR and VEGFR, whereas the sensitivity to
cisplatin was not significantly altered (IC50, 4.0 Amol/L in PC-9
versus 7.1 Amol/L in RPC-9).
Phosphorylation levels of EGFR in RPC-9 cells do not
decrease after gefitinib treatment. We examined the EGFR
phosphorylation levels in both PC-9 and RPC-9 cells by Western
blotting using an antibody against EGFR Y1068. As previously
reported, levels of the phosphorylated Y1068 decreased in PC-9
cells treated with gefitinib (33, 37), whereas RPC-9 cells displayed
persistent phosphorylation on Y1068 (Fig. 2A). We then asked
whether constitutive activation of EGFR in RPC-9 cells was
associated with alterations in downstream signaling pathways. As
expected, the phosphorylated levels of Akt and Erk1/2 remained
high in RPC-9 cells treated with up to 2 Amol/L of gefitinib,
whereas both levels were drastically reduced by the same treatment
in PC-9 (Fig. 2A).
Potential mechanisms for gefitinib resistance in RPC-9. The
above data raised several possibilities regarding the gefitinib
resistance mechanism in RPC-9. First, we considered a decreased
intracellular concentration of gefitinib. This was excluded by
measuring the uptake of 14C-labeled gefitinib (data not shown).
Another possibility was an activating mutation in a gefitinibinsensitive tyrosine kinase other than EGFR, which could transphosphorylate EGFR. ErbB2/Her2 was the prime candidate for
this because a recent report described that Her2 harboring an
insertional mutation in the kinase domain (exon 20) could result in
the constitutive phosphorylation and activation of EGFR, which
is resistant to gefitinib (38). We thus sequenced exons 18 to 24 of
ErbB2, and found no mutation (data not shown). The third
possibility was that EGFR is hyperactivated by drastically increased
expression of EGFR ligands. Fourth, it was possible that EGFR itself

www.aacrjournals.org

underwent changes that could eliminate inhibition by gefitinib. To
exclude these possibilities, we isolated EGFR from PC-9 and RPC-9
by immunoprecipitation, and compared the in vitro kinase activity
of precipitated EGFR in the presence of gefitinib. Gefitinib clearly
suppressed the kinase activity of EGFR isolated from PC-9 cells, but
not from RPC-9 cells (data not shown). Collectively, these data
indicate that the EGFR in RPC-9 cells was altered such that the
EGFR kinase activity was no longer effectively inhibited by gefitinib
treatment.
Direct sequencing assay for T790M mutation. Recent
observations indicate that an EGFR secondary mutation, T790M,
is associated with acquired resistance in patients chronically
treated with gefitinib (23–25). To examine whether there were such
additional mutations in RPC-9, we did PCR amplification followed
by direct sequencing of all of the exons (exons 18–28) encoding the
cytoplasmic region of the EGFR. We confirmed the persistence of
the original 15 bp deletion. Additionally, a C-to-T base pair change
at nucleotide 2369 was identified in exon 20, which leads to a
substitution of methionine for threonine at position 790 (T790M;
Fig. 3A).
To further characterize this additional mutation, we amplified
the EGFR exon 19 to 20 from PC-9 or RPC-9 cDNA, and the
product was subcloned into plasmid vector, then inserts were
isolated and sequenced. Among the 29 sequences from RPC-9, we
found that 9 had no mutations (wild-type), 12 had only the 15-bp
deletion, and 8 had both the 15-bp deletion and the T790M
mutation (Table 1). The T790M mutation was present only on the
same clone as the 15-bp deletion. Of 10 clones isolated from PC-9,
6 had no mutation originating from the wild-type allele, whereas
the others had the 15-bp deletion. This is at the expected ratio for
a heterozygous mutation, and also suggests that the T790M
mutation occurred in one or more of the amplified alleles that
harbor the 15-bp deletion.

We wished to know how many alleles of EGFR existed in PC-9 or
RPC-9 cells. We did CGH analyses using BAC microarray to assess
the gain or loss of 530 genes including EGFR (data not shown), and
found that the EGFR gene in PC-9 and RPC-9 cells displayed a 1.8and 1.4-fold signal increase, respectively, compared with the
normal human genome. Thus, it is likely that PC-9 or RPC-9 cells
had the f2-fold ( four alleles) or f1.5-fold (three alleles) amplified
EGFR gene, respectively. Together with the sequencing data of the
subcloned PCR product as described above, these data suggest that
parental PC-9 cells had two wild-type alleles and two mutant alleles
with the 15 bp deletion. On the other hand, in RPC-9 cells, the ratio
between alleles (wild-type versus the allele with 15-bp deletion only
versus the alleles with 15-bp deletion and T790M mutation)
seemed to be roughly 1:1:1. Thus, it seemed possible that one EGFR
allele was lost during the establishment of RPC-9 cells by unknown
mechanisms, and that could be the wild-type allele.
Decreased expression levels of ErbB3 in RPC-9 cells. To
further characterize any changes in the EGFR signal transduction
in RPC-9 cells, we examined PC-9 or RPC-9 cells by 4G10
antiphosphotyrosine Western blot analysis (Fig. 2B). In lysates
from both cell lines, the band at f160 kDa in the 4G10 blot
seemed to be the phosphorylated EGFR, because of the molecular
weight and the fact that treatment with gefitinib resulted in the
disappearance of the band in PC-9 lysates. Of note, a prominent
phosphotyrosine band at f200 kDa was observed only in PC-9 but
not in RPC-9 cells, which was affected by gefitinib treatment in a
similar manner as p-EGFR. The membranes probed with 4G10 were
stripped and re-probed with respective ErbB receptor antibodies.
Anti-ErbB3, but not anti-ErbB2, detected a band that completely
overlapped with the f200 kDa band in question (Fig. 2B; data not
shown). ErbB4 was not detectable in either RPC-9 or parental PC-9
cells (data not shown). Interestingly, ErbB3 protein levels were
remarkably decreased in RPC-9 cells compared with PC-9 cells as
shown in Figs. 2B and 5A, whereas ErbB2 levels were not
appreciably altered (Fig. 2C).

Previous reports showed that PI3K associates with ErbB3
exclusively in gefitinib-sensitive NSCLC cell lines, and treatment
with gefitinib dissociates this complex, thereby leading to
decreased Akt activity (39). Thus, the EGFR-ErbB3-PI3K-Akt
pathway seems to be the key signaling axis, which determines
gefitinib sensitivity in NSCLC cells (40). Given the significantly
decreased level of ErbB3 expression, this pathway could be
dysfunctional in RPC-9 cells. To investigate this possibility, we first
looked at the dimerization between ErbB3 and EGFR. Comparison
of anti-EGFR immunoprecipitates between PC-9 and RPC-9 cells
revealed that EGFR effectively associated with ErbB3 only in PC-9
cells, and that was not affected by gefitinib treatment (Fig. 2D, top).
Next, we analyzed the interaction between ErbB3 and p85a, which
is the regulatory subunit of type 1a PI3K (40). As shown in Fig. 2D
(bottom), ErbB3 coprecipitated with p85a in PC-9 cells, however,
the amount of ErbB3 in anti-p85a immunoprecipitates seemed
much lower in RPC-9 cells. Western blotting using antiphosphotyrosine 4G10 detected a prominent band in PC-9, which comigrated with ErbB3 (Fig. 2D, bottom). Because phospho-Akt levels
were as high in RPC-9 as in PC-9 cells (Fig. 2A), these data suggest
that the pathway which maintained PI3K/Akt activation in RPC-9
was probably altered from that in PC-9 cells, and the roles of ErbB3
could be less prominent.
T790M mutation could be the sole mechanism of RPC-9
resistance. The EGFR phosphorylation in RPC-9 cells was
refractory to gefitinib treatment (Fig. 2A), and they harbor the
T790M mutation (Fig. 3A). These facts strongly suggested that
T790M is the reason for the resistance to gefitinib in RPC-9 cells.
However, to prove that, we need to specifically knock-down the
expression of the EGFR harboring T790M. In our hands, the
efficiency of small interfering RNA knockdown in PC-9 or RPC-9
cells was far from perfect, and hence, this experiment is not
feasible at the moment.
We therefore planned to see whether dilution of the T790Mcarrying EGFR by the EGFR without T790M affects the gefitinib

T790M Mutation in a Gefitinib-Resistant NSCLC Cell Line

Figure 3. T790M mutation was detected
in RPC-9 cells. A, sequencing of EGFR
RT-PCR products (top ) from late passage
cells (RPC-9-51d, 55d, RPC-9) revealed
a C-to-T base pair change (arrows ) that
corresponds to the T790M. Although
this mutation was not detectable by
direct sequencing of RT-PCR products
from PC-9, RPC-9-36d, or -44d cells,
mutant-enriched PCR assay (bottom )
confirmed the presence of T790M mutation
in RPC-9-44d (arrows ). B, the sensitivity
of the indicated cells was determined in the
absence or presence of different doses
of gefitinib for 96 h using modified MTT
assay.

resistance of RPC-9. To this end, RPC-9 cells were retrovirally
transduced with the FLAG-tagged EGFR carrying only the 15-bp
deletion. Western blotting with anti-FLAG antibody confirmed the
expression of the transduced EGFR, and surface expression of
EGFR was modestly increased as revealed by fluorescence-activated
cell sorting analysis (Fig. 4A). Perhaps surprisingly, the EGFRinfected cells displayed a significant reversal of the gefitinib
resistance (Fig. 4B). We also analyzed lysates from transduced cells
that were preincubated with increasing concentrations of gefitinib
by anti–phospho-EGFR (Y1068) immunoblotting. Consistent with
the reversal of the resistance, the phosphorylation of EGFR was
significantly inhibited in EGFR-transduced RPC-9 cells but not in
control cells (Fig. 4C).
To test whether the gefitinib resistance of RPC-9 is a
consequence of ErbB3 down-regulation, RPC-9 cells were transduced with retrovirus encoding ErbB3 tagged with enhanced
green fluorescent protein (Fig. 5A). Expression of ErbB3-GFP has
previously been used for examining signal propagation in the
plasma membrane (41). We found that forced ErbB3 expression in
RPC-9 cells had no effect on the resistance to gefitinib (Fig. 5B).
In addition, the levels of ErbB3 were further decreased in RPC-9
cells in which gefitinib tolerance was reversed by ectopic
expression of EGFR with the 15-bp deletion (Fig. 4A).
A small fraction of T790M-positive cells arise during
gefitinib exposure. PC-9 cells were stocked periodically during
the course of gefitinib exposure on days 36, 44, 51, and 55 before
establishment of RPC-9 (designated RPC-9-36d, RPC-9-44d, RPC-951d, and RPC-9-55d, respectively). The sequencing analysis of EGFR
T790 from these cells is summarized in Fig. 3A. The late passage
cells (RPC-9-51d and 55d) clearly contained a T790M mutation,
and the C-to-T peak became more prominent at 55 days, which
suggested a subclone of cells harboring the secondary mutation

emerged during gefitinib treatment and became dominant under
chronic selection by gefitinib. We compared the gefitinib sensitivity
of PC-9, RPC-9, and RPC-9-55d cells by using MTT assay (Fig. 3B).
The level of resistance in RPC-9-55d was milder than that of RPC-9.
This could be explained by the smaller fraction of T790Mcontaining cells existing in RPC-9-55d cultures compared with
RPC-9.
To detect T790M mutation in a more sensitive manner, we did a
modified mutant-enriched PCR assay (30). This assay was originally
reported to detect one copy of the mutant T790M allele in the
presence of 1,000 copies of wild-type alleles (30). To check the

Discussion
In this study, we have established a gefitinib-resistant NSCLC cell
line, RPC-9, from highly sensitive PC-9 cells that carry a 15-bp
deletion in EGFR gene exon 19 (36). We found that in RPC-9 cells,
the phosphorylation level of EGFR did not respond to gefitinib
treatment. Consistently, the secondary mutation, T790M, was
detected in RPC-9, and this was likely to be a major reason for the
resistance. Several lines of evidence supported this conclusion.
First, the T790M mutation occurred in cis to the 15-bp deletion;
therefore, the T790M mutation directly affected the activated
EGFRs that were promoting the growth of the cell line. Second, in
cell specimens periodically banked during the 2-month course of
gefitinib exposure, there was an apparent correlation between the
gradually increased fraction of cells carrying the T790M mutation
and the increase in resistance. Third, introduction of the EGFR
carrying the activating 15-bp deletion into RPC-9 cells reversed
gefitinib resistance, suggesting that the ratio between gefitinibsensitive and gefitinib-resistant alleles could be an important factor
in determining gefitinib sensitivity. This observation also suggested
that the growth and survival of RPC-9 cells was probably still
heavily dependent on EGFR signaling. Fourth, we have excluded a
number of potential contributing factors, such as intracellular
concentration of gefitinib, as described in Results.
It is currently unclear whether the T790M mutation occurred
de novo during the gefitinib exposure or if we simply picked out
preexisting RPC-9 type cells from PC-9 culture. Consistent with the
latter possibility, accumulating evidence now indicates that T790M
mutation emerges without gefitinib treatment as a minor clone in
some patients (29, 30). Because the mutant-enriched PCR assay

antibody (top ). Cells were stained with PE-conjugated anti-EGFR antibody,
and subjected to fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis (bottom ). B, cells
were plated on 96-well plates and exposed to gefitinib for 96 h, then subjected to
modified MTT assay. RPC-9 cells transduced with EGFR carrying the 15-bp
deletion (RPC-9-EGFR-del) or control retrovirus encoding only FLAG epitope
(RPC-9-flag) were analyzed in parallel with PC-9 and RPC-9 cells. C, RPC-9
cells transduced with EGFR carrying the 15-bp deletion (RPC-9-EGFR-del) or
control retrovirus (RPC-9-flag) were treated for 6 h with gefitinib at the indicated
concentrations. Cell lysates were prepared and subjected to immunoblots

sensitivity of our modified version of the assay, PC-9 and RPC-9
cells were mixed at a ratio of 1:1, 10:1, 100:1, and 1,000:1, and
genomic DNA was extracted and analyzed. We were able to detect
the presence of the T790M allele in 1:1, 10:1, and 100:1 cell mixtures
but not in the 1,000:1 mixture (data not shown). Given the number
of EGFR alleles as described above, the detection limit of the assay
lies somewhere between f1:400 and f1:4,000 alleles. We found
that T790M-positive cells were already detectable in RPC-9-44d but
not in RPC-9-36d (Fig. 3A). Consistently, RPC-9-44d displayed weak
gefitinib resistance in the MTT assay (data not shown).

T790M Mutation in a Gefitinib-Resistant NSCLC Cell Line

could not detect T790M in PC-9 cells, the fraction of such clones in
the PC-9 population, if present, should be <1:100.
We estimate that T790M exists in one of the two mutant EGFR
alleles, and possibly one of the two wild-type alleles may have been
lost in RPC-9. This may have provided growth advantage by
increasing the ratio of active EGFR in the pool of total EGFR
molecules, and this could be an additional, albeit minor,
mechanism of gefitinib resistance in RPC-9. Alternatively, it is also
possible that loss of the wild-type allele was a neutral event that
occurred by chance in this setting. However, consistent with the
former possibility, we detected mild reversal of the resistance in
RPC-9 transfected with wild-type EGFR (data not shown).
Of note, we also found a decreased association of EGFR with
ErbB3 in RPC-9, accompanied by a change in the signal
transduction pathway. This could be due to the decreased
expression levels of ErbB3 in RPC-9, with activation of Akt kinase
by EGFR possibly being mediated through another adapter
molecule. For example, Grb2-associated binding protein 1 (Gab1)
can bind directly to EGFR, and it facilitates PI3K signaling through
its tyrosine phosphorylation sites in cells not expressing ErbB3
(42, 43). To exclude the contribution of decreased ErbB3 to the
resistance, we introduced ErbB3-GFP into RPC-9, but this could not
restore the sensitivity.
Besides our study, there has been only one published report that
established a gefitinib-resistant NSCLC cell line that has a T790M
mutation (28). This study used a H3255 cell line carrying a EGFR
L858R mutation, in which the EGFR gene had undergone extensive
amplification (>40 alleles). The resistant subline, H3255 GR, harbors
only a very limited number of EGFR alleles with a T790M mutation
because 3 out of 91 (3.3%) cloned reverse transcription-PCR
products carry T790M. In our study, nearly half of the transcripts
from the activated EGFR allele also had a T790M mutation, and a
modest amount of ectopically expressed EGFR restored sensitivity.
This discrepancy could be related to the use of different cell lines,
or the presence of different mutations (L858R versus 15-bp
deletion). In any case, our study predicts that a very small number
of EGFR carrying T790M in a given NSCLC cell does not necessarily
confer high levels of gefitinib resistance. The resistance effects of
T790M could be diluted in cells with a large number of active EGFR
alleles until the allele with T790M itself is amplified to certain
levels. Therefore, it is conceivable that NSCLC patients with EGFR
amplification could sustain response to gefitinib for longer

durations than NSCLC without amplification, as indicated by a
recent clinical study (44, 45).
Koizumi et al. also established a gefitinib-resistant PC-9 subline
(termed PC-9/ZD) using a strategy similar to ours but with brief
exposure to a mutagenic drug N-methyl-N¶-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (37). However, the T790M mutation was not found in the PC-9/
ZD subline. Nonetheless, the overall phosphorylation levels of
EGFR are refractory to gefitinib treatment, suggesting the existence
of important resistance mechanisms other than T790M mutation.
Interestingly, PC-9/ZD has decreased ErbB3 levels similar with RPC9, raising the possibility that the continuous exposure to gefitinib
selects PC-9 cells that have altered EGFR-ErbB3-PI3K signaling.
While this article was under review, the amplification of protooncogene MET was reported to cause acquired resistance in
in vitro–selected resistant sublines of NSCLC cell line HCC827 as
well as in patients treated with gefitinib or erlotinib (46). Our BAC
microarray analysis showed no MET amplification in RPC-9 (data
not shown), excluding this possibility.
In summary, we have isolated a gefitinib-resistant subline, RPC-9,
from the highly sensitive NSCLC cell line PC-9. The occurrence of
the secondary mutation, T790M, is most likely the predominant
mechanism for the resistance, which could be reversed by the
expression of gefitinib-sensitive EGFR. We suggest that the balance
of expression levels of gefitinib-sensitive or gefitinib-resistant EGFR
proteins may play a role in regulating gefitinib sensitivity in
patients with NSCLC.
