ABSTRACT
Diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is a heterogeneous group of aggressive
lymphomas that can be classified into three molecular subtypes by gene expression
profiling (GEP): GCB, ABC and unclassified. Immunohistochemistry-based cell
of origin (COO) classification, as a surrogate for GEP, using three available
immunohistochemical algorithms was evaluated in TMA-arranged tissue samples
from 297 patients with de novo DLBCL treated by chemoimmunotherapy (R-CHOP
and R-CHOP-like regimens). Additionally, the prognostic impacts of MYC, BCL2,
IRF4 and BCL6 abnormalities detected by FISH, the relationship between the
immunohistochemical COO classification and the immunohistochemical expression
of MYC, BCL2 and pSTAT3 proteins and clinical data were evaluated.
In our series, non-GCB DLBCL patients had significantly worse progression-free
survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS), as calculated using the Choi, Visco-Young
and Hans algorithms, indicating that any of these algorithms would be appropriate
for identifying patients who require alternative therapies to R-CHOP. Whilst MYC
abnormalities had no impact on clinical outcome in the non-GCB subtype, those
patients with isolated MYC rearrangements and a GCB-DLBCL phenotype had worse
PFS and therefore might benefit from novel treatment approaches.

INTRODUCTION

associations with prognosis [17, 19–24]. Concurrent MYC
and BCL2 rearrangements [20, 25–27] are associated
with poor outcome in DLBCL and are commonly found
in GCB-type DLBCLs [28]. IRF4 rearrangements are
associated with a GCB phenotype in grade 3FL and
DLBCL, and with younger age and favorable outcome
[29]. Constitutive activation of STAT3 is preferentially
detected in the non-GCB subtype of DLBCL, and seems
to favor proliferation and survival of lymphoma cells [30].
However, the prognostic impact of this molecule is yet to
be established.
In an attempt to confirm that IHC algorithms can
be used to prognostically stratify DLBCL patients, we
compared the Hans, Choi and Visco-Young algorithms
in a cohort of 297 diagnostic samples from patients with
R-CHOP-treated DLBCL. Also, to establish whether
deregulation of specific oncogenes may further classify
COO-based DLBCL subtypes, adding meaningful
prognostic information, we performed FISH of BCL6,
BCL2, IRF4 and MYC and evaluated the expression of
MYC, BCL2, BCL6 and pSTAT3 proteins in the same
samples.

Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the
most prevalent subtype of mature B-cell neoplasms
worldwide, accounting for approximately 30% of all nonHodgkin lymphomas. A combination of rituximab with
an anthracycline-based chemotherapy regimen, such as
R-CHOP, produces a favorable outcome for most patients.
Nevertheless, one third of patients will still relapse, of
whom a proportion will suffer from refractory disease [1].
Although the International Prognostic Index (IPI)
has proved to be a very useful clinical tool, and is widely
used to risk-stratify patients [2], it is exclusively based
on clinical variables and therefore fails to capture the
biological heterogeneity of DLBCL, and does not identify
potential targeted therapies.
In recent years, biological studies have shown that
DLBCL is not a single disease but a group of disorders
with specific signaling programs [3], some of which have
been shown to benefit from specific novel treatments.
Specifically, gene expression profiling (GEP) has identified
three DLBCL subtypes: the germinal center B-cell-like
(GCB) and the activated B cell-like (ABC) DLBCL
subtypes, and unclassified cases (~10%). GCB patients
tend to have better survival than the ABC and unclassified
DLBCL patients when treated by chemotherapy, with
or without rituximab [4, 5]. New treatments including
ibrutinib [6] or immunomodulators such as lenalidomide
have shown very promising results in patients with an
ABC or non-GCB DLBCL subtype [7], as determined
by GEP and immunohistochemistry in separate clinical
trials. Although preferential activity with bortezomib for
cases with the refractory ABC/non-GCB subtype was
suggested early on [8], recently published data concerning
frontline VR-CAP do not indicate a significant difference
with R-CHOP in the non-GCB type DLBCL [9], and the
differential efficacy remains controversial.
For this reason, identification of cases that will not
respond to conventional approaches but might benefit
from targeted therapy has become a matter of considerable
interest.
Several studies have demonstrated that
immunohistochemical (IHC) algorithms can reproduce
GEP classification and potentially be used for the
prognostic stratification of DLBCL [10–12]. Of these,
the Hans, Visco-Young and Choi algorithms have shown
the highest concordance with the cell of origin (COO)
as defined by GEP. However, several clinical studies
investigating the ability of COO IHC algorithms to
prognostically stratify DLBCL patients treated with
anthracycline-based chemotherapy with or without
rituximab have yielded conflicting results [13–18].
Recurrent non-random chromosomal rearrangements
leading to the deregulated expression of MYC, BCL6 and
BCL2 in DLBCLs have been reported to have mixed

RESULTS
The COO of 272 (91%), 282 (95%) and 275
(92%) of the 297 DLBCL tumor samples could be
classified by the Hans, Visco-Young and Choi algorithms,
respectively (Figure 1). No significant differences were
observed between the IHC phenotypes with respect to
age or extranodal involvement. However, the non-GCB
group of patients had a higher IPI score (p≤0.011) and
more frequently presented with stage III or IV disease
(p≤0.001). Non-GCB cases had higher LDH levels and
worse performance status than GCB cases as classified
by the Hans and Visco-Young algorithms (Table 1 and
Supplementary Tables 1 and 2).
Comparing GEP with the results of the Hans, Choi
and Visco-Young algorithms, revealed discrepancies in the
COO classification in only 14%, 13% and 8% patients,
respectively [12].

MYC, BCL2, BCL6 and pSTAT3 protein
expression and correlation with COO
phenotypes
45% of the evaluable samples (62/140) showed
MYC overexpression. 72% and 64% of patients with
MYC protein overexpression also had high LDH levels
(p=0.011) and high IPI scores (p=0.029), respectively
(Supplementary Table 3). MYC overexpression was
not associated with a particular COO phenotype
(Supplementary Table 4). MYC and BCL2 doublepositivity was found in 34% of evaluable cases (42/123
cases). As previously described, MYC and BCL2 double-

of MYC rearrangements and MYC protein expression (5
out of 63 cases with MYC protein overexpression had
MYC rearrangements).
MYC gains (Supplementary Table 7) were observed
in 19% of patients and were more frequently observed in
the group of patients with normal LDH values (p=0.032).
Cases with MYC gains expressed MYC, BCL2 and BCL6
protein in 31%, 56% and 84% of cases, respectively. MYC
gains were associated with gains in BCL2 (p=0.002) and
BCL6 (p=0.002), but there was no association with other
cytogenetic, biological or clinical features.
BCL2 rearrangements were detected in 19% of
patients (Table 2). There was no association between the
presence of any type of BCL2 gene abnormality and the
main clinical features studied. BCL2 rearrangements were
almost entirely restricted to the GCB phenotype (Table
1, p<0.001). There was a close correlation between the
presence of a BCL2 rearrangement and BCL2 protein
overexpression (p=0.003; 95% of cases with the BCL2
rearrangement expressed the BCL2 protein; data not
shown). BCL2 gains were observed in 14% of patients and
were more frequently detected in the non-GCB phenotype
group (p=0.013; 80% of cases with BCL2 amplification
had a non-GCB phenotype; Table 1).
BCL6 rearrangements were observed in 30% (51
out of 171) of DLBCL patients, were associated with a
non-GCB phenotype (Table 1, p<0.001; 70% of cases)
[38] and were more frequent in the group of patients
with elevated LDH (p=0.021) (Table 2). However,
there was no association with other clinical features.
BCL6 gains, observed in 17% of patients, showed
no significant association with any of the clinical or
phenotypic features analyzed. In contrast to the BCL6
rearrangements, there was a direct relation between the
presence of BCL6 gains and BCL6 protein expression
(Table 2; p=0.02).
Double rearrangements were detected in 10 of 178
cases: there were concurrent BCL2/MYC rearrangements

positive (DP) cases determined by IHC were commonly
found to have a non-GCB phenotype (p=0.007, p=0.018
and p=0.002 for the Visco-Young, Hans and Choi
algorithms, respectively) (Supplementary Table 4). Most
patients coexpressing the MYC and BCL2 proteins were
aged over 60 years (74%), had stage III or IV disease
(74%), and 36% of cases had two or more extranodal
sites involved and were therefore associated with highrisk IPI (p=0.003; Supplementary Table 5). 15% and 24%
of MYC and BCL2 double-positive cases had MYC and
BCL2 rearrangements, respectively (p=0.030 and p=0.938,
Supplementary Table 6).
Isolated BCL2 overexpression was not associated
with the COO classification, and there were no
associations between BCL2 protein expression and any of
the clinical or biological features analyzed in our series
(data not shown).
pSTAT3 protein expression was detected in 34%
(47/139) of evaluable cases and was associated with
advanced-stage disease (p=0.003) and high IPI score
(p=0.045; Supplementary Table 5). Its expression was
more frequent in cases with elevated MYC expression
(p=0.006) (Supplementary Table 3).

MYC, BCL6, BCL2 and IRF4 abnormalities
MYC rearrangements were observed in 7% of
patients (15 out of 206 cases) (Table 2 and Figure 1), 30%
of which had additional cytogenetic abnormalities, BCL2
rearrangements and MYC gains being the most common
added gene aberrancies (in 4 out of 13, and 2 out of 15
evaluable cases, respectively). MYC rearrangements were
more frequent in patients younger than 60 years of age
(p=0.029), with more than two extranodal localizations
(p=0.009), and in the high-risk IPI group (p=0.051).
We found no difference in the distribution of MYC
rearrangements with respect to the COO phenotype. No
significant correlation was observed between the presence

Survival analysis

in 4 cases, BCL2/BCL6 rearrangements in 5 cases and
MYC/BCL6 in 1 case. Taken together, 80% of doublerearrangement DLBCL cases had a GCB phenotype
(p=0.029), and there was a higher absolute proportion of
them in patients aged over 60 years (p=0.073) and with
elevated LDH values (p=0.053), although these trends
were not statistically significant (Supplementary Table
8). 37% of patients presented involvement of two or more
extranodal sites, and 60% had stage III or IV disease.
Considering only double-hit cases (BCL2/MYC and BCL6/
MYC patients), no significant association with any specific
clinical or biological feature was detected, probably due to
the small number of cases available.
IRF4 rearrangements and gains were observed in 3
out of 76, and 4 out 41 assessable patients, respectively.
67% and 100% of IRF4 rearrangement and gain cases,
respectively, had a non-GCB phenotype (Table 1). There
was no association between the IRF4 rearrangement
and the clinical variables. An association between IRF4
and BCL2 gains was observed (p=0.035). In contrast
to previously published data [29], in our series, 60% of
patients with IRF4 rearrangements were over 60 years old.
It should be noted, however, that 60% of the patients in
this study were older than 60 years of age.

All clinical and biological variables were evaluated
for their ability to predict response and outcome. In the
univariate analysis, stage III-IV disease was associated
with worse OS (p=0.016) and PFS (p<0.001), as were
elevated LDH levels, age ≥60 years, poorer performance
status, extranodal involvement and high IPI score. As in
previous studies, the independent prognostic impact of all
IPI variables was maintained in the multivariate analysis.
Considering the Visco-Young, Choi and Hans
algorithms, the non-GCB subgroup was associated
with significantly worse PFS (p=0.001, p=0.005 and
p=0.003, respectively) and OS (p=0.002, p=0.001 and
p=0.001, respectively) (Table 3 and Figure 2A and 2B).
In the multivariate analysis (Table 4), COO classification
remained an independent prognostic factor of PFS and OS
for all the algorithms (Table 4, hazard ratio [HR] 1.7-2.1;
p<0.03). The algorithms showed close agreement with
each other, with a level of concordance of 88.6-90.3 %
(multi-rater kappa, ḵ=0.8).
As seen in a previous study [39], patients with MYC
rearrangements and GCB phenotype had a significantly
shorter PFS (p=0.035, p=0.004 and p=0.021, for the

Hans, Choi and Visco-Young algorithms, respectively)
(Figure  2G, Supplementary Table 9). None of the
algorithms was of prognostic value with respect to OS,
although with the Visco-Young algorithm, patients with
a GCB phenotype and MYC rearrangements showed a
non-significant tendency towards a lower OS (p=0.098),
(Supplementary Table 10). Neither BCL2 nor BCL6
abnormalities had a clear impact on outcome, either in
the series as a whole or in the specific COO subtypes. In
contrast, in the entire series, BCL6 expression tended to be
associated with better PFS (p=0.077) and OS (p=0.048).
In our series, patients coexpressing MYC and BCL2
did not show worse PFS or OS. The presence of MYC,
BCL2 and/or pSTAT3-positive protein expression was not
associated with poorer PFS or OS. This might be due to
the limited number of cases with available IHC data for
these markers. Unavailability was most commonly due to
tissue exhaustion.

classification continues to be the standard clinical tool for
predicting the outcome of DLBCL patients in the rituximab
era [40]. However, it does not capture the biological
heterogeneity of the disease and does not identify potential
targets for therapy. GEP studies have identified three
subtypes of DLBCL with distinct biological signatures: the
GCB, the ABC and the unclassified groups. Although gene
expression in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue
[41] is probably the preferred method for differentiating
these two DLBCL subtypes, it is not yet available in most
centers. Classification using digital PCR assay has shown
promising results [41, 42]. Nevertheless, a subgroup of
~10% of cases would remain unclassified even after using
these methods.
Several studies have shown that IHC algorithms can
discriminate GCB and non-GCB DLBCL subtypes with a
high concordance with GEP, but there is still a reluctance
to using them in the clinical setting. In this study, the
Hans, Visco-Young and Choi algorithms were used as
surrogates for GEP-based COO molecular classification.
Variation due to the technique was reduced by centralized
staining and scoring. All the IHC approaches used
were able to distinguish the two prognostic subgroups,
and showed substantial agreement among themselves,

and a similar correlation with GEP [12]. The results
were comparable to those we and other researchers had
obtained in previous studies [12, 43]. In agreement with
previous reports [10, 44, 45], the non-GCB subgroup had
a worse outcome, with a shorter PFS and OS, and this
prognostic impact was maintained in the multivariate
analysis. These results indicate that non-GCB patients
require novel treatment approaches, including the
addition of novel compounds, in order for the responses
to be sustained. Indeed, a number of different new drugs
including lenalidomide, some proteasome inhibitors, and
the BTK inhibitor ibrutinib (PCI-32765) have recently
shown promising results, especially in non-GCB/ABC
DLBCL patients [7, 46–49]. Whether IHC and GEP are
equally capable of distinguishing patients who could
benefit from these novel compounds requires further
investigation since the results published so far emerged
from different methods of determination.
To refine the prognostic stratification of patients
after GCB/non-GCB IHC classification, we analyzed the
effect of MYC, BCL2, BCL6 and IRF4 abnormalities as
detected by FISH. We detected MYC rearrangements in 7%
of the cases, only 30% of which had additional cytogenetic
abnormalities. The negative impact on prognosis for the
isolated MYC rearrangement, as a single cytogenetic
abnormality, was restricted to patients with a GCB
phenotype and was associated with a shorter PFS. Thus,
although the prognostic implication of the finding was not
confirmed in the multivariate analysis, probably because
of the small number of patients with this abnormality,
our results [39] confirm that the favorable prognosis of
GCB-type DLBCL is overcome by the negative effect
of MYC rearrangements. For this reason, a systematic
investigation of MYC rearrangements, at least within the
GCB subgroup of patients, would be worthwhile. Despite
their lower PFS, these patients did not have a significantly
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

worse OS, indicating that these particular cases may be
more aggressive but can be rescued with savage therapies.
Together, these findings suggest that GCB-type DLBCL
patients carrying a MYC rearrangement would probably
benefit from treatment strategies other than R-CHOP, for
example, more aggressive chemotherapy schemes such
as R-DAEPOCH, or the addition of MYC inhibitors.
Indeed, several small molecules have been identified as
MYC inhibitors, although none is currently in clinical use
[50]. In a recently employed approach, MYC expression
is blocked by impairing a BET bromodomain protein,
a strategy that has proved effective both in vitro and in
xenograft models in a range of hematological neoplasms,
including Burkitt lymphoma [51–53]. It should be noted
that MYC rearrangements and MYC expression were not
correlated in this study, indicating that MYC expression
might not be the best screening method for detecting MYC
rearrangements in cases of DLBCL NOS. Almost half
of the patients expressing MYC protein also had a high
level of pSTAT3 expression. pSTAT3 was preferentially,
but not exclusively, overexpressed in the non-GCB type
DLBCL cases [30, 34], but, in contrast to other groups
[54, 55], was not associated with an unfavorable outcome.
Thus, our findings are consistent with those of previous
studies demonstrating that pSTAT3 signaling is involved
in regulating MYC expression [56], so pSTAT3 inhibitors
could also be used in those cases [57, 58].
As in previous studies, double-hit DLBCLs seem to
be restricted to GCB-type DLBCLs. However, the small
number (5/100) and the short follow-up of these cases
prevented us from determining the prognostic impact in
terms of OS and PFS. Most patients with concurrent MYC
and BCL2 overexpression had high-risk IPI features and,
consistent with previous findings, this phenotype was
found more frequently than the double-hit with FISH and,
unlike with true double-hits, was associated with a non18043

Oncotarget

GCB phenotype [33, 59, 60]. Notably, only 15% and 24%
of double-IHC cases had MYC and BCL2 rearrangements,
respectively, suggesting that there must be other
mechanisms that induce MYC and BCL2 overexpression.
In our cohort, BCL2 rearrangements, which were
observed in 19% of the patients, were also mainly
restricted to the GCB phenotype [22]. However, in contrast
to the results from previously published series [22, 61], we
found no clear negative effect on those patients’ outcome,
possibly due to the small number of cases featuring the
abnormality. Also, the adverse prognostic implication
of BCL2 rearrangements might apply only to younger
patients, so the different selection criteria used in the
studies might explain the observed differences [62].
Nevertheless, BCL2 inhibition is an attractive target for
therapy, as illustrated by the fact that at least three BCL2
antagonists are currently undergoing clinical trials for
cancer treatment [63].
In accordance with previous findings, BCL6
rearrangements that were usually detected in the nonGCB patient group [38] were not clearly associated with
BCL6 protein overexpression, and their detection was
of no independent prognostic consequence with respect
to OS or PFS. The prognostic contribution of BCL6
protein expression remains controversial [64–66] and, as
with some previous studies, we have shown that BCL6
expression is associated with a better OS in the rituximab
era. Since BCL6 expression is almost completely restricted
to germinal center cells and some lymphomas, BCL6 is an
attractive target for therapy with several specific BCL6
inhibitors currently being investigated [67].
In summary, our results confirm that COO
classification based on IHC is a reproducible and practical
approach to stratifying DLBCL patients into GCB and
non-GCB phenotypes, the latter being associated with
a higher risk of progression and reduced survival when
conventional R-CHOP regimens are used. These patients
might benefit from treatment with novel compounds that
target signaling pathways known to be constitutively
activated in this particular lymphoma subtype.
Identification of MYC rearrangements enables
GCB-DLBCLs to be stratified into prognostic groups.
GCB patients with isolated MYC rearrangements have a
higher risk of progression and might benefit from adding
new therapeutic approaches, including drugs that inhibit
MYC function. Despite the lack of prognostic information,
identification of certain proteins, such as BCL6 or
pSTAT3, might be of interest as potential druggable target
molecules.

obtained from various centers in Spain (153 cases), and
other institutions involved in the International DLBCL
Rituximab-CHOP Consortium Program Study in the
USA (144 cases). Some of these cases have already
been published [31, 32]. The study was reviewed and
approved by each of the participating Institutional
Review Boards. The overall collaborative study and the
study protocol and sampling methods were approved
by the Institutional Review Board of the Hospital
Universitario Marqués de Valdecilla/IDIVAL, Spain.
Histopathological criteria used for their diagnosis and
classification were those of the WHO Classification
[3]. Cases associated with HIV or HCV infections or
previous immunosuppressive treatments were excluded,
as were cases diagnosed as T-cell histiocyte-rich B-cell
lymphoma, primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma cases,
cutaneous LBCL, intravascular LBCL, EBV+DLBCL
and those histologically associated with a follicular
lymphoma component. All patients were treated as part
of their routine care with standard treatment protocols
using a combination of anthracycline-based regimens (6-8
cycles in most cases) and rituximab. Follow-up data on
progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS)
were available for 279 (94%) and 283 (95%) patients,
respectively.

Immunohistochemistry, TMA construction and
FISH analysis
Histopathological
evaluation,
immunohistochemistry and FISH analysis were performed
in a central laboratory by experienced hematopathologists
and cytogeneticists. All DLBCL cases were histologically
confirmed and representative areas were selected.
Detailed IHC staining procedures are described in the
Supplementary Data. The cut-offs for the IHC markers
were BCL2 >70%, MYC >40% and pSTAT3 >10%, based
on published data [33, 34]. Scoring of GCET1, MUM1,
CD10, BCL6, and FOXP1 was based on the cut-offs
used by Choi et al [11], Hans et al [10] and Visco Young
[35]. Immunoreactivity was scored by two independent
pathologists (SMM and SMU) and the percentage of
tumor-cell staining was estimated by visual inspection
and categorized into the appropriate decile. Disagreements
were resolved by joint review using a multiheaded
microscope. For each case the most representative core,
with the highest percentage of neoplastic cells, was
selected.
FISH analyses were performed on 3-μm TMA tissue
sections following standard procedures [36, 37] (see
Supplementary Data for details). At least 100 intact, nonoverlapping nuclei were analyzed from each TMA core.
Discordant duplicates were reevaluated by two observers
(AB, SG). Nuclei were scored as rearranged if at least
one split orange-green signal was observed. Gains were
reported when three or more fusion signals were observed.

Statistical analysis
Patient characteristics and response rates were
compared using the X2 or Fisher’s exact test, depending on
the number of observations. PFS was defined as the time
from initial diagnosis to progressive disease under therapy,
failure to achieve complete remission, additional therapy,
relapse, or death from any cause. OS was defined as the
time from initial diagnosis to death. PFS and OS were
analyzed using the log-rank test and illustrated as KaplanMeier plots. A Cox proportional hazards multivariate
regression model was derived. Differences between the
results of comparative tests were considered significant
for two-sided values of p<0.05. The multi-rater kappa was
used to assess the concordance between the algorithms.
