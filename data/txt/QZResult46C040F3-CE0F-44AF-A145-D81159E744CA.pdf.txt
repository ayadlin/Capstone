BACKGROUND: To define the clinicopathologic and prognostic features of patients with human T-cell lymphotropic
virus type-1 (HTLV-1)-associated adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) in North America, standard criteria were
used to identify patients with ATLL. METHODS: Statistical analyses used included descriptive statistics, Kaplan-Meir
survival analysis, and recursive partitioning. RESULTS: Eighty-nine patients were identified between August 1992 and
May 2007, including 37 (41.6%) males and 52 (58.4%) females with a median age of 50 years (range, 22-82 years). All
but 6 patients had immigrated to the United States from the Caribbean, Latin America, or Africa. The acute subtype
predominated (68.5%). The majority of patients received a combination-alkylator–based chemotherapy regimen in
the front-line setting (72.6%). The most common regimen was cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone at standard doses or attenuated and/or with methotrexate (CHOP-like), which produced an overall response
rate of 64.1%. Despite initial responses to therapy, the median overall survival for all subtypes was 24 weeks (range,
0.9-315 weeks). Although the International Prognostic Index and Prognostic Index for peripheral T-cell lymphoma
unspecified identified subsets of patients, these models were not completely predictive. A recursive partitioning analysis was performed on the data, which successfully identified 3 prognostic categories based on Eastern Cooperative
Oncology Group performance status, stage, age, and calcium level at diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: This series proposed
a new prognostic model for patients with HTLV-1–associated ATLL and confirmed a poor outcome for these patients

Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) is a rare and aggressive peripheral T-cell neoplasm caused by the human
T-cell lymphotropic virus type-1 (HTLV-1), a type C human retrovirus endemic in regions of Japan, sub-Saharan Africa,
and the Caribbean basin, as well as in regions of the United States where immigrants of endemic countries reside. The disease develops after a long latency period and can be divided into 4 subtypes: acute, lymphomatous, chronic, and smoldering.1 Patients with the acute and lymphomatous subtypes have the poorest prognosis, with a median survival of only 6 to

13 months, despite aggressive combination chemotherapy. The median survival for the chronic subtype is
approximately 24 months and is variable for the smoldering subtype.2,3
Since the initial description of the subtype classification, several studies, primarily from Japan, have sought to
further identify prognostic factors for ATLL. Poor performance status, high lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level,
age >40 years, large numbers of lesions, and hypercalcemia were the major factors found to be associated with a
shorter survival in all types of ATLL based on a multivariate analysis.4 Multiple sites of visceral and bone marrow
involvement were identified as poor prognostic factors in
other smaller series.5 ATLL cells are classically identified
by their highly indented or lobulated nuclei; however,
morphologic diversity of ATLL cells has also been
described and is also associated with a poor prognosis.6
The majority of series regarding ATLL originate
from the East (largely from Japanese experiences), and
many report only a few patients, occasionally only 1. The
rarity of this disease makes it exceptionally difficult to
understand its natural history, and to develop models for
the risk stratification of the disease. In addition, most
authorities suspect that the disease originating in Japan
may be different from that more commonly observed in
the Caribbean and Latin American populations.7 According
to the US census, New York City hosts the greatest number
of Caribbean-born immigrants to the United States.8 This
setting provides a unique opportunity to evaluate this disease
in a relatively concentrated and focused manner.
We report the clinicopathologic features, course,
and therapy for ATLL among this population in the
United States, and assess the value of pre-existing prognostic models. To the best of our knowledge, this series
represents 1 of the largest focused on a North American
population of patients with ATLL, and proposes risk
stratification based on a novel recursive partitioning
model. Clearly, for progress to be made in this disease, we
need a better understanding of the natural history of the
disease and associated prognostic features.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Identification of Patients and Diagnostic
Criteria
Institutional Review Board approval was obtained to conduct a retrospective chart review for ATLL cases. Cases
were identified by reviewing inpatient, outpatient, and
pathology computer databases at the State University of

Cancer

July 15, 2010

New York, Downstate Medical Center; Columbia University Medical Center; and Memorial Sloan-Kettering
Cancer Center in New York City. Patients included in the
analysis met the following criteria: 1) a clinical history
consistent with ATLL (ie, immigrated from a known
endemic region and had signs and symptoms consistent
with a lymphoproliferative process); 2) a positive serologic
test for HTLV-1 by an enzyme-linked immunoadsorbent
assay with confirmation by Western blot analysis; and 3)
histopathologic findings consistent with ATLL. All cases
were characterized as acute, lymphomatous, smoldering,
or chronic subtypes according to the Lymphoma Study
Group criteria.1
Response Criteria
Response to treatment was classified according to the
International Working Group criteria as follows: a complete response (CR) was defined as disappearance of all
evidence of disease, with residual abnormal lymphocytes
in the peripheral blood of <1%; a partial response (PR)
was defined as a 50% decrease in the sum of the largest
diameter of each lesion and/or reduction of abnormal
lymphocytes in the peripheral blood; and progressive disease (PD) was defined as disease that continued to grow or
spread despite treatment.9 Normalization of other laboratory values, including serum calcium and LDH, were also
evaluated and used in determination of response. All
responses were assessed at 4 weeks from therapy completion.
Statistical Analysis
Patient characteristics were summarized using counts and
frequencies for categorical variables and medians and
ranges for continuous variables. Overall survival (OS) was
defined as the time from diagnosis to death. Survival
curves for OS were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier
method.10 Univariate associations between individual
clinical factors and OS were evaluated using the log-rank
test for categorical variables and the Cox model for continuous variables.11,12 Maximum log-rank analysis was
used to select the optimal cut-off for calcium.13 To develop a simple risk model as well as allow for interactions
of factors independently associated with OS, we used recursive partitioning analysis.14 Recursive partitioning
analysis was used because several clinical characteristics
(age, performance status, and laboratory abnormalities, in
addition to the Shimoyama classification) affect prognosis, and traditional multivariable modeling does not provide a simple way to group patients by prognostic
categories. Recursive partitioning analyses separates

patients at each step into 2 groups based on the covariate
that gives the maximum separation with respect to their
prognosis and accounts for interactions between factors.

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics and Clinical Features
Eighty-nine cases of ATLL were identified at 3 New York
City medical centers between August 1992 and May 2007
(Table 1). The population included 37 males (41.6%)
and 52 females (58.4%), with a median age of 50 years
(range, 22-82 years). All but 6 patients had immigrated to
the United States from the Caribbean, Latin America, or
Africa; the other 6 were US-born African Americans. The
majority of patients were from Jamaica (25.8%) and the
Dominican Republic (17.9%). The acute subtype of
ATLL predominated (68.5%), followed by the lymphomatous (20.2), chronic (6.8%), and smoldering (4.5%)
subtypes.
The most common presenting symptoms were
lymphadenopathy (80.9%) and skin rash (38.2%). Other
less common presenting symptoms included fever, soft
tissue mass, fatigue, back pain, altered mental status, dyspnea, cough, abdominal pain, night sweats, and weight
loss. The median Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group
(ECOG) performance status at presentation was 3. White
blood cell counts ranged from 3.0 to 334  109/L, with a
median value of 12.5  109/L. Hypercalcemia, corrected
for serum albumin, was noted in 71.9% of patients, with
a median calcium level (among those presenting with
hypercalcemia) of 13.5 mg/dL (range, 9.8-27 mg/dL).
LDH was elevated in most patients (93.2%), with a median level of 793 U/L (range, 158-10,290 U/L). Twentyeight patients (31.5%) had central nervous system (CNS)
involvement detected during their course.
Treatment and Response
Table 2 summarizes the treatment and response to therapy
for all patients identified. Eighty-four patients received
first-line therapy, and 5 patients received no therapy at all.
The most common front-line therapy administered to
patients was a combination alkylator-based chemotherapy
regimen (69.3%). A CHOP-like regimen (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone at standard doses or attenuated and/or with methotrexate) was the
most common regimen used (46.4%), and produced an
overall response rate of 64.1% (CRs in 7 patients and PRs
in 18 patients). Twelve patients (9.5%) received frontline zidovudine and interferon (IFN) either alone (8

second-line setting included denileukin diftitox (7 treated
patients with an overall response rate of 28.6%), zidovudine and IFN (6 treated patients with an overall response
rate of 16.7%). Additional regimens used and their
response rates are presented in Table 2. Eighteen patients
(20.2%) were given third-line therapy, and responses
were relatively common in this setting, despite the presence of heavily treated disease (unpublished data).
Survival and Prognosis
Despite initial responses to therapy, the median OS for all
patients irrespective of disease subtype was only 24 weeks
(range, 0.9-315 weeks). The median survival for specific
subtypes was noted to be 19.4 weeks for the acute subtype,
37.3 weeks for the lymphomatous subtype, 89.1 weeks for
the chronic subtype, and was not reached for the smoldering subtype (Figs. 1a and 1b).
According to the International Prognostic Index
(IPI), 8 patients (9.1%) were classified as being at low
risk, 11 patients (12.5%) as being at low intermediate
risk, 13 patients (14.8%) as being at high intermediate
risk, and 56 patients (63.6%) as being at high risk
(1 patient could not be evaluated due to missing data).
The median OS by IPI risk group was 271 weeks, 65
weeks, 31 weeks, and 16 weeks, respectively (P < .01)
(Fig. 2a). The overwhelming majority of patients were
classified as being at high risk. The Prognostic Index for
peripheral T-cell lymphoma unspecified (PTCL-U) (PIT)
could be determined in 68 patients; 10 patients (14.7%)

had a score of 0 to 1 (Group 1), 19 patients (27.9%) had a
score of 2 (Group 2), 31 patients (45.6%) had a score of 3
(Group 3), and 8 patients (11.8%) had a score of 4 (Group
4). The median OS by PIT risk group was 61 weeks,
28 weeks, 24 weeks, and 11 weeks, respectively (P < .01)
(Fig. 2b). The PIT failed to separate patients in Groups 2
and 3, with a disproportionate number of patients being
classified in Group 3.
A new risk model was developed using the variables
of the IPI and PIT. In addition, calcium level at diagnosis
was also included because it demonstrated independent
prognostic value. Calcium was categorized as high or low
if it was above or below 11 mg/dL because this cut-off was
close to the value selected based on the maximum logrank analysis. Recursive partitioning analysis of OS based
on these variables provided a tree with 5 nodes (Fig. 3),
which fell into 3 risk categories. The low-risk patients had
stage I to II disease and an ECOG performance status <2.
The intermediate-risk group was comprised of 2 sets of
patients: 1) those with stage III to IV disease with an

ECOG performance status <2 and 2) those with an
ECOG performance status 2 with calcium 11 mg/dL

of 2 sets of patients) included 1) those patients with an
ECOG performance status 2 with calcium 11 mg/dL
and age >60 years or 2) those patients with an ECOG
performance status 2 and calcium >11 mg/dL. There
were 10 patients (11.2%) in the low-risk group (median
survival, 156.6 weeks), 31 patients (34.8%) in the intermediate-risk group (median survival, 45.4 weeks), and 48
patients (53.9%) in the high-risk group (median survival,
13 weeks) (P < .01) (Fig. 4).

DISCUSSION
ATLL is a rare complication of HTLV-1 infection that is
reported not only in known HTLV-1 endemic areas, but
also in regions with a high number of immigrants from
those areas. To the best of our knowledge, the current
retrospective series represents 1 of the largest North

American experiences published to date among primarily
Caribbean and Latin American descendents. The presentation and clinical course of these patients is similar to
that noted in other series; however, CNS involvement was
a prominent feature of this population. When placed into
the context of experiences published over the past 30
years, it is clear there has been little to no change in the
outcome of patients diagnosed with ATLL.
The majority of case series of ATLL come from
Japan, where the virus is endemic. Reports from Japan,
Jamaica, Trinidad, and Barbados have demonstrated
marked differences in the clinical and demographic features of ATLL in these 2 parts of the world.15-18 In Japan,
the annual incidence of ATLL is 86 cases per 100,000
population, and it is 3 times more likely to be diagnosed
in men than in women. The median age of Japanese
patients is 57.1 years, and most present with leukemic
manifestations.15 Smoldering ATLL is part of the case
spectrum in Japan, and is associated with a normal lymphocyte count. In contrast, ATLL in the Caribbean has an
annual incidence of approximately 20 cases per 100,000
population, with a female predominance and a median
age of 40 years.7 Prior series suggest Caribbean patients
present more frequently with lymphomatous disease, and
smoldering ATLL is less commonly reported.
Six patients in this series were US-born African
Americans, whereas all other patients had immigrated to
New York City from the Caribbean, Latin America, or

Cancer

Africa. They appear to have demographic and clinicopathologic features similar to that described in Japan, the
Caribbean, and in other series among immigrant populations.19-21 It is interesting to note that, to our knowledge,
the current series documents 1 of the highest rates of CNS
involvement in ATLL patients reported to date (defined
as positive cerebrospinal fluid [CSF] cytology at any
period during a patients’ course; approximately 30% in
the current study). Teshima et al. first reported a CNS
involvement rate of 10.1% in 99 patients in Japan. CNS
involvement was more common among those with lymphomatous disease, but no survival difference was noted
between those with and those without CNS disease.22 At
the time of initial diagnosis, CNS involvement was evident in 2.5% of patients in an early Lymphoma Study
Group series, whereas in an autopsy series, the rate was as
high as 11.4%.4,23 This may suggest that CSF should be
analyzed in patients with ATLL with consideration of
intrathecal prophylaxis.
To the best of our knowledge, there is currently no
standard of care for patients with ATLL, because most
patients are treated with chemotherapy programs derived
from B-cell lymphoma treatment programs. The most
commonly used front-line chemotherapy regimens in this
series were CHOP and etoposide, doxorubicin, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, and prednisone (EPOCH).
Although initial overall response rates were high,
responses were not durable and the majority of patients
ultimately developed progressive disease and died of their
disease. It is hypothesized that several factors impact the
poor outlook of patients treated with conventional combination chemotherapy regimens. ATLL patients are known
to be immunocompromised at the time of diagnosis,
which could worsen their ability to tolerate the

3443

Original Article

chemotherapy by putting them at excess risk for opportunistic and bacterial infections.24 In addition, the malignant cells in ATLL can express ATP-binding cassette B
(ABCB), major vault protein (MVP), ATL-derived factor,
and mutated p53, all of which have all been associated
with intrinsic drug resistance.25-28
Mixed responses to zidovudine and IFN have been
reported, which was also observed herein. Two preliminary
phase 2 studies on the combination of zidovudine and IFNa have demonstrated a high response rate in previously
untreated and treatment refractory patients with ATLL.29,30
This was confirmed in subsequent small prospective trials,
but to our knowledge has yet to be tested in a randomized
manner.31,32 Lower response rates to zidovudine and interferon were noted in the current study, in which only 1 CR
was observed in 8 patients receiving the regimen as frontline therapy. It is not entirely clear why the responses were
lower in this study; however, they are similar to a study
reported by the National Institutes of Health, in which 18
patients with ATLL were treated with zidovudine and IFN
and only 3 patients achieved an objective response lasting
longer than 1 month.33 A recent meta-analysis of the combination of zidovudine and IFN in a worldwide population
suggests that this therapy is less effective for patients with
the lymphomatous subtype of ATLL.34
To the best of our knowledge, the published literature for patients with ATLL treated with a biologically
based therapy has been limited to case reports only. ATLL
is a malignant clone of mature T-cells that almost invariably express CD4 and CD25, with many cases also expressing CD52.35,36 Isolated reports of ATLL patients with
aberrant phenotypes and poor outcomes have been
described, suggesting a poor prognosis among these
cases.37 In the current series, analysis of the phenotype in
a subset of patients did not change the risk categorization
(data not presented), but additional, larger studies are
warranted to explore the impact of alternate phenotypes
(eg, CD8-positive and CD4- CD8- double negative
ATLL) on clinical behavior. Seven patients received
alemtuzumab and 7 patients received denileukin diftitox
either alone or in combination with chemotherapy at
some point during their treatment course. One patient
treated with alemtuzumab (anti-CD52) in the first-line
setting achieved a PR, whereas 2 patients treated with
denileukin diftitox (anti-CD25) in the second-line setting
achieved PRs. Although the response rates were disappointing, further larger studies addressing the merits of
biologically based therapies alone and in combination are
required.

Despite initial responses to treatment, the median
survival for all patients was found to be poor and varied by
subtype. The distinction between subtypes is often difficult to establish at the time of diagnosis and patients can
transform from 1 subtype to another during their disease
course.38 In this context, prognostic factor analysis of
patients with all subtypes of ATLL at diagnosis is important, and risk stratification may help better guide therapeutic programs.
The IPI and PIT have been defined for aggressive
B-cell and T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma, respectively;
however, to the best of our knowledge, there is no broadly
accepted prognostic score for patients with ATLL.39,40
Our analyses suggest that the IPI and PIT poorly separate
the different ATLL prognostic groups, nor are the number
of patients allocated to each group evenly distributed. For
example, the IPI does not separate patients with IPI 3 to
5 disease, and allocates only 8 of 88 patients to the lowrisk category (P < .01). Similarly, the PIT score does not
separate PIT 2 or 3 categories, and allocates most patients
to these 2 categories (P < .01).
Most prognostic models use regression models
(logistic or proportional hazards regression). These
approaches are most suitable when the goal is to quantify
the relative contribution of the exploratory variables.41
Recursive partitioning analysis models provide insights
into the data structure, separating patient populations
recursively at each step into 2 distinct groups based on the
covariate that provides the maximal separation with
respect to prognosis. Importantly, and distinctly different
for other models, it accounts for interactions among factors, allowing for optimal separation of prognostic categories. Using a recursive partitioning model, the ATLL
Prognostic Score (APS) distinguishes 3 risk groups: 1) low
risk (median OS of 156.6 weeks), 2) intermediate risk
(median OS of 45.4 weeks), and 3) high risk (median OS
of 13 weeks) (P < .01). The risk categories are well separated, although most cases fall into the intermediate-risk
and high-risk groups. The limitations of our proposed
prognostic scoring system include a small sample size, heterogeneous treatment strategies, and lack of data regarding biologic markers of disease. In future studies, we hope
to validate our novel clinical score prospectively and
accrue additional data regarding biologic factors associated with poor prognosis. These factors include not only
aberrant ATLL phenotypes, but also high interleukin-5
serum levels, C-C chemokine 4 expression, p53 mutation,
and p16 deletion, and these may help better stratify disease risk.42

Prognostic Factors of HTLV-1 ATLL/Phillips et al

The results of this review suggest that HTLV-1
infection and its disease manifestations are an emerging
public health problem in urban communities of the
United States with a significant Caribbean and Latin
American population. To the best of our knowledge, the
current study is the first series to date to describe ATLL
among Dominican immigrants and the first to document
such a high rate of CNS involvement. The median overall
survival for all patients in this series was only 24 weeks,
representing 1 of the poorest outcomes reported for any
subtype of lymphoma. A new prognostic score incorporating Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance
status, stage, age, and calcium may help to guide riskadapted treatments for this aggressive disease, and ultimately help improve the survival of patients with ATLL.
