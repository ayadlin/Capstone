ABSTRACT
The functional role of nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT), a key regulator
of the immune response, in bladder cancer progression remains uncertain. In
this study, we assessed biological significance of NFAT in human bladder cancer.
Immunohistochemistry detected nuclear/cytoplasmic NFATc1 signals in 14
(21.5%)/34 (52.3%), respectively, of 65 muscle-invasive bladder carcinomas and
showed that patients with nuclear NFATc1-positive tumor had a significantly higher risk
of disease progression (P = 0.006). In bladder cancer cell lines, cyclosporine A (CsA)
and tacrolimus (FK506), immunosuppressant drugs/non-selective NFAT inhibitors,
attenuated NFATc1 expression and its nuclear translocation, NFAT transcriptional
activity, and the expression of cyclooxygenase-2 and c-myc, downstream targets of
NFATc1. NFAT inhibition via NFATc1-small interfering RNA (siRNA) or treatment with
these NFAT inhibitors resulted in decreases in cell viability/colony formation, cell
migration/invasion, and the expression/activity of MMP-2 and MMP-9, as well as an
increase in apoptosis, in the parental/control lines. No significant additional inhibition
in the viability and invasion of NFATc1-siRNA cells was seen. In xenograft-bearing
mice, CsA and FK506 significantly retarded tumor growth. These results suggest
that NFATc1 plays an important role in bladder cancer outgrowth. Thus, NFATc1
inactivation, especially using CsA and FK506, has the potential of being a therapeutic
approach for bladder cancer.

widely used in transplant medicine, specifically inactivated
the NFAT pathway [4].
There is an increasing amount of evidence suggesting
that NFAT signaling contributes to the development and
progression of not only hematological malignancies but also
solid tumors. Expression levels of NFAT isoforms, especially
NFATc1, have been assessed in several types of cancer tissue
specimens. Indeed, NFATc1 overexpression was detected in
pancreatic [5], lung [6], and liver [7] carcinomas. Further
functional analyses have revealed NFAT isoform-specific
involvement in cancer progression, as seen in the regulation
of hematopoietic system. In particular, NFATc1 was shown
to promote tumor growth via, for instance, induction of
c-myc in pancreatic cancer [5], cyclooxygenase (COX)2 in melanoma [8], and autotaxin/lysophosphatidic acid
axis in breast cancer [9]. In a sarcoma model, NFATc1 was

INTRODUCTION
Nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT), initially
identified as a regulator of T-cell activation [1], has
subsequently been characterized mainly in immune cells
[2]. NFAT family members, including NFATc1 (also
known as NFAT2), NFATc2 (NFAT1), NFATc3 (NFAT4),
and NFATc4 (NFAT3), are located in the cytoplasm of
immune cells (e.g. lymphocyte) in a hyperphosphorylated
state and translocate into the nucleus upon cell stimulation
by their dephosphorylation in response to Ca2+-calcineurin
signals [2, 3]. The nuclear NFATs then form heterodimers
with other transcription factors and induce downstream
gene transcription. Interest in NFAT signaling was further
enhanced by the observation indicating that cyclosporine

also found to be oncogenic, whereas NFATc2 functioned
as a tumor suppressor [10]. Moreover, NFATc1 has been
implicated, as a key regulator, in lymphangiogenesis [11].
On the other hand, little is known about the specific roles
of NFATc3, NFATc4, and NFAT5 in tumorigenesis and
tumor progression, although inhibition of breast cancer cell
motility by NFATc4 has been reported [12].
The functional role of NFAT signaling in bladder
cancer progression remains largely unknown. In
the current study, we investigated whether NFATc1
inactivation inhibited the growth of bladder cancer cells.

cytoplasmic positivity of NFATc1 and patient age, gender,
pT stage, or status of lymph node involvement. Kaplan-Meier
analysis coupled with log-rank test further showed a strong
association between nuclear expression of NFATc1 (P =
0.006; Fig. 1D), but not its cytoplasmic positivity (P = 0.164;
figure not shown), and disease progression after cystectomy.

Down-regulation of NFAT by CsA and FK506 in
bladder cancer cells
We determined the effects of CsA and FK506, which
were known to inhibit NFAT signals in immune cells [4],
on NFATc1 expression by western blotting, RT-PCR,
and immunofluorescence in bladder cancer cells. NFATmediated transcriptional activity was also determined in
the cell extracts with transfection of a NFAT luciferase
reporter plasmid. As expected, transfection of a NFATc1small interfering RNA (siRNA) silenced endogenous
NFATc1 protein (Fig. 2A) and mRNA (Fig. 2B) in UMUC3
cells. Similarly, CsA and FK506 both at 1 μM reduced
NFATc1 gene expression in all bladder cancer cell lines
tested (Fig. 2B). Subcellular localization of NFATc1 was
then examined in UMUC3 by western blotting: treatment
with CsA or FK506 resulted in decreases in nuclear
NFATc1 expression as well as an increase in cytoplasmic
NFATc1 expression (marginal change by CsA) (Fig. 2C).
Inhibition of nuclear translocation of NFATc1 was further
confirmed by immunofluorescence (Fig. 2D). Additionally,
NFATc1-siRNA as well as CsA and FK506 decreased
NFAT luciferase activity, compared with control-siRNA
transfection or mock treatment (Fig. 2E). Significant but
only 20% reduction in NFAT activity by the NFATc1siRNA might be due to silencing of only one of NFAT
isoforms. To confirm the down-regulation of NFAT activity
by CsA and FK506, we measured expression levels of
COX-2 and c-myc, downstream targets of NFATc1 signals

RESULTS
Expression of NFATc1 in human bladder cancer
We first examined the expression of NFATc1 in
human urothelial carcinoma cell lines, UMUC3, TCCSUP,
647V, and 5637, and an immortalized human normal
urothelial cell line, SVHUC, by western blotting (Fig. 1A)
and reverse transcription (RT)-polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) (Fig. 1B). All four bladder cancer lines were found
to express NFATc1 at both protein and mRNA levels, and
its expression in the benign urothelial line was weaker.
We next stained immunohistochemically for NFATc1
in the bladder tissue microarrays (TMAs) consisting of 65
cases of invasive bladder cancer. Positive signals were
detected in both the nucleus and cytoplasm of tumor
cells (Fig. 1C). Nuclear NFATc1 was positive in 14 cases
[21.5%; 9 (13.8%) 1+, 4 (6.2%) 2+, and 1 (1.5%) 3+] and
cytoplasmic NFATc1 was positive in 34 cases [52.3%; 19
(29.2%) 1+, 8 (12.3%) 2+, and 7 (10.8%) 3+] (Table 1).
Spearman’s correlation analysis revealed a positive
correlation between nuclear versus cytoplasmic expression
of NFATc1 (R2 = 0.2117; P < 0.001). Meanwhile, there were
no statistically significant correlations between nuclear or

[5, 8]. Significant decreases in COX-2 protein (Fig. 2F)/
mRNA (Fig. 2G) and c-myc mRNA (Fig. 2H) by NFATc1siRNA and CsA/FK506 were also seen. These results
indicate that CsA and FK506 down-regulate the expression
and activity of NFATc1 in bladder cancer cells.

apoptotic indices. By contrast, these only marginally
changed the G0/G1 population.

Anti-proliferative effects of CsA and FK506 in
bladder cancer cells

Cell migration and invasion are critical steps
during tumor progression and metastasis. We therefore
performed a scratch wound healing assay and a transwell
invasion assay to assess the effects of NFATc1 inhibition
on cell migration and invasion, respectively, in bladder
cancer lines. In the wound healing assay, CsA and FK506
significantly delayed wound closure (Fig. 4A). Similarly,
in the transwell assay, CsA and FK506 treatment
demonstrated marked decreases in cell invasion ability
(Fig. 4B). NFATc1 knock-down resulted in a significant
decrease in the invasive properties, compared with the
control line, while no significant effects of CsA and
FK506 on cell invasion were seen in the NFATc1-siRNA
line (Fig. 4C). Using a quantitative RT-PCR method,
we then analyzed the effects of CsA and FK506 on the
expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) that
are known to play a critical role in cancer cell migration/
invasion, angiogenesis, and resultant tumor progression
and metastasis. CsA and FK506 decreased the levels
of MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression, compared with the
vehicle control, in two cell lines, except CsA for MMP-9
in TCCSUP (Fig. 4D). We also determined the enzymatic
activity of MMP-2 and MMP-9 by gelatin zymography

Suppressive effects of CsA and FK506 on
bladder cancer cell migration and invasion

To determine whether NFATc1 down-regulation
exerts an influence on the proliferation of bladder cancer
cells, we assessed cell viability [by methylthiazolyldiphenyltetrazolium (MTT) assay] and colony formation (by
clonogenic assay) in bladder cancer lines treated with CsA
or FK506. In the parental cell lines, CsA and FK506 strongly
suppressed their growth (Fig. 3A). Similar inhibition by CsA
and FK506 was observed in UMUC3-control-siRNA cells
(Fig. 3B). However, there were no significant additional
decreases in the growth of UMUC3-NFATc1-siRNA cells,
while an inhibitory effect of NFATc1-siRNA, compared with
UMUC3-control-siRNA, was seen (Fig. 3B), suggesting the
suppression by CsA or FK506 predominantly via NFATc1.
Both CsA and FK506 were also found to decrease the number
and area of colonies in UMUC3 and TCCSUP cells (Fig. 3C).
To investigate how CsA and FK506 inhibit cell
proliferation, we performed terminal deoxynucleotidyl
transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL)
assay (Fig. 3D) and flow cytometry (Fig. 3E). CsA or
FK506 treatment for 24 hours significantly increased

UMUC3 and MMP-2 in TCCSUP in the presence of CsA
and FK506 (Fig. 4E).

NFATc4 [12] were noted. Therefore, each isoform is
likely to specifically regulate downstream targets as well
as tumor progression or regression in different types of
cancers.
Correspondingly, overexpression of NFAT isoforms
in several types of malignancies, other than bladder
cancer, has been reported. Of these, the expression levels
of NFATc1 were often elevated [5–7]. In these studies,
localization of NFATc1 detected by immunohistochemical
staining (i.e. nuclear vs. cytoplasmic signals) appeared
to be cancer type-dependent. For instance, both nuclear
and cytoplasmic signals were detected in pancreatic
[5] and lung [6] carcinomas, whereas predominant
nuclear/cytoplasmic expression was seen in hepatocellular
carcinoma [7]/subcutaneous T-cell lymphoma [18],
respectively. Our immunohistochemistry for NFATc1 in
muscle-invasive bladder cancers stained both the nuclei
and cytoplasms. Although there were no significant
correlations between the status of NFATc1 expression and
clinicopathologic features available for our patient cohort,
those with nuclear NFATc1-positive tumor were found to
have a significantly higher risk of disease progression.
Our recent immunohistochemical study in separate sets of
bladder TMAs consisting of non-muscle-invasive tumors
[19] also detected both nuclear and cytoplasmic NFATc1
signals and further revealed significant increases in the
level of its nuclear expression in urothelial neoplasm,
compared with non-neoplastic urothelium, and in lowgrade or high-grade urothelial carcinoma, compared
with papillary urothelial neoplasm of low malignant
potential, a very low grade tumor that is neither benign
nor intrinsically malignant [20]. Our staining results thus
support other data suggesting that NFATc1 promotes
bladder cancer progression.
The immunosuppressive drugs CsA and FK506 have
been shown to inhibit the phosphatase activity of calcineurin
in T-cells and thereby prevent nuclear translocation of
NFAT/inactivate the NFAT pathway [4, 21]. We confirmed
this in bladder cancer cells by demonstrating that CsA and
FK506 reduced the overall and nuclear levels of NFATc1
expression, suppressed the transcriptional activity of
NFAT, and down-regulated the expression of COX-2 and
c-myc. In addition, CsA and FK506 treatment inhibited cell
viability, migration, and invasion of bladder cancer in vitro,
and tumor growth in vivo. They also induced apoptosis,
but not cell cycle arrest. Interestingly, these effects of CsA
and FK506 were not seen in NFATc1 knock-down cell
lines, suggesting that these non-selective NFAT inhibitors
suppress bladder cancer growth predominantly through the
NFATc1 pathway. Nonetheless, anti-proliferative effects
of CsA via non-NFAT pathway have also been reported in
colon cancer models [22].
As aforementioned, CsA and FK506 have often
been prescribed in organ transplant recipients to
prevent rejection as well as in a subset of patients with
disorders related to autoimmunity. Treatment with these

Anti-tumor activity of CsA and FK506 in a
mouse xenograft model for bladder cancer
Finally, we used a mouse xenograft model to
investigate whether CsA and FK506 inhibit bladder
tumor growth in vivo. UMUC3 cells were implanted
subcutaneously into the flank of SCID mice, and after 2–3
weeks, when the estimated tumor volume reached 100
mm3, we commenced daily injections of CsA or FK506
(Fig. 5A). As shown in Fig. 5B, the inoculated tumors in
mice treated with CsA or FK506 were significantly smaller
than those in the control mice at 12–16 days of treatment.
CsA and FK506 also prevented the growth of tumors
exceeding 2,000 mm3 or 10% of the animal’s body weight
(Fig. 5C). Immunohistochemical staining in the harvested
specimens revealed decreases in NFATc1 expression
(Fig. 5D) and cell proliferation as the percentage of
Ki-67-positive cells (Fig. 5E) in CsA/FK506-treated
tumors. These in vivo data further suggest that CsA and
FK506 strongly inhibit the progression of bladder cancer.

DISCUSSION
In contrast to a wide range of biological functions of
NFATs in the immune system that have been recognized,
an increasing, yet limited, amount of evidence suggests
their involvement in the progression of solid tumors. In
particular, their roles in bladder cancer progression remain
largely unknown. In the present study, we demonstrate that
NFATc1 inactivation via NFATc1-siRNA as well as CsA
and FK506 results in bladder tumor regression.
Intracellular calcium-mediated calcineurin signaling
and subsequent activation of the NFAT pathway, without
specifying the involvement of its isoforms, have been
implicated in cell proliferation of prostatic [13, 14] and
endometrial [15] carcinomas. It has also been shown that
NFATc1 activation promotes liver cancer cell proliferation
[7] and breast cancer cell migration [9]. Potential
downstream targets of NFATc1 for its regulation of
cancer cell growth include c-myc, COX-2, and autotaxin
[5, 7–9], all of which are known to involve stimulation
of cancer cell proliferation and invasion, chemotaxis,
and/or metastasis. Using bladder cancer lines, we here
demonstrated that they overexpressed NFATc1 and that
silencing of NFATc1 resulted in significant decreases,
similar to those by CsA or FK506 treatment, in cell
viability and invasion. These results further suggest that,
among NFAT isoforms, NFATc1 plays a dominant role
in bladder cancer progression. However, in other types
of malignancies, other isoforms (e.g. NFATc2) were also
shown to contribute to the promotion of tumor progression
[16, 17], while inhibitory functions of NFATc2 [10] and

immunosuppressants is associated with potentially serious
side effects that are often closely related to their blood
concentrations [23]. As a result, the doses of CsA and
FK506 are often strictly adjusted to maintain their levels
of not more than 1200 ng/mL (1.0 μM) and 20 ng/mL
(25 nM), respectively. Thus, FK506 clinically shows
similar immunosuppressive effects with up to 50-fold
lower doses than CsA [24]. In our cell line studies, the
same concentration (1 μM) of CsA and FK506 achieved
similar inhibition, whereas, in our xenograft model,
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

30 mg/Kg/day CsA and 3 mg/Kg/day FK506 showed
similar effects. Therefore, CsA may be more potent
in suppressing bladder cancer growth than FK506
at their pharmacological concentrations. Indeed, a
pharmacological dose (25 nM) of FK506 did not
significantly inhibit cell viability of bladder cancer lines
(data not shown). In prostate cancer lines, CsA showed
more significant inhibitory effects on cell proliferation,
compared with FK506 at the same concentrations up to
10  μM [25]. Moreover, CsA was shown to inhibit the
1589

growth of both androgen-sensitive and androgen receptor
(AR)-negative prostate cancer lines, while FK506 inhibited
only AR-dependent growth but failed to do in ARnegative cells [25]. Although some bladder cancer lines
are known to possess a functional AR [26–28], FK506
(and CsA) similarly inhibited the growth of AR-positive
(i.e. UMUC3, TCCSUP) versus AR-negative (i.e. 647V,
5637) bladder cancer cells. Additionally, to prevent severe
adverse drug reactions potentially seen with CsA or FK506
treatment, a peptide that interferes with the calcineurinNFAT interaction [29, 30] and small molecule inhibitors
of NFATs [31–33] have been developed and assessed
mainly in animal models. The efficacy of these inhibitors
in bladder cancer growth may also need to be tested.
In conclusion, NFATc1 likely plays an important
role in bladder cancer progression. Our findings may also
offer a potential therapeutic strategy for bladder cancer
via targeting the calcineurin-NFAT pathways, especially
NFATc1 signals. CsA (and FK506) may thus be able to
be applied to the treatment of advanced bladder cancer.
Further assessment of the functions of NFATc1 as well
as other isoforms is required to determine biological
significance of NFAT signaling in bladder cancer.

presence or absence of CsA or FK506. The media were
refreshed every 48 hours. After 96 hours of treatment,
10 μL MTT stock solution (5 mg/mL; Sigma) was added
to each well with 100 μL of medium for 4 hours at
37°C. The medium was replaced with 100 μL dimethyl
sulfoxide, followed by incubation for 5 minutes at room
temperature. The absorbance was then measured at a
wavelength of 570 nm with background subtraction at
655 nm using luminometer (FLUOstar Omega, BMG
Labtech).

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Total RNA (0.5 μg) isolated from cultured cells
using TRIzol (Invitrogen) was reverse transcribed using
1 μM oligo (dT) primers and 4 units of Omniscript
reverse transcriptase (Qiagen) in a total volume of
20 μL. Real-time PCR was then performed, using SYBR
GreenER qPCR superMix for iCycler (Invitrogen),
as described previously [32]. The following primer
pairs were used for RT-PCR: NFATc1 (forward,
5′-GTCCCACCACCGAGCCCACTACG-3′; reverse,
5′-GACCATCTTCTTCCCGCCCACGAC-3′), MMP-2
(forward, 5′-TACAGGATCATTGGCTACACACC-3′;
reverse, 5′-GGTCACATCGCTCCAGACT-3′), MMP-9
(forward,
5′-TGTACCGCTATGGTTACACTCG-3′;
reverse, 5′-GGCAGGGACAGTTGCTTCT-3′), COX-2
(forward, 5′-CTGGCGCTCAGCCATACAG -3′; reverse,
5′-CGCACTTATACTGGTCAAATCCC-3′), and c-myc
(forward,
5′-ACCAGATCCCGGAGTTGGAA-3′;
reverse, 5′-CGTCGTTTCCGCAACAAGTC-3′). GAPDH
(forward, 5′-CTCCTCCACCTTTGACGCTG-3′; reverse,
5′-CATACCAGGAAATGAGCTTGACAA-3′) was used
as an internal control.

Reporter gene assay
Cells at a density of 50-70% confluence in 24well plates were co-transfected with 250 ng of pGL4.30
NFAT reporter plasmid DNA (Promega) and 2.5 ng of
pRL-TK plasmid DNA, using GeneJuice. After 18 hours
of transfection, the cells were cultured in the presence
or absence of CsA or FK506 for 24 hours. Cell lysates
were then assayed for luciferase activity determined using
a Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay kit (Promega) and
luminometer.

RT and real-time PCR

Cell culture and chemicals
A human normal urothelial cell line (SVHUC)
and human urothelial carcinoma cell lines (UMUC3,
TCCSUP, and 5637) were originally obtained from the
American Type Culture Collection. 647V cell line was
used in our previous study [26]. All these lines were
recently authenticated, using GenePrint 10 System
(Promega), by the institutional core facility. SVHUC cells
were maintained in F-12K (Mediatech) and other cell
lines were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s
medium (DMEM; Mediatech), all supplemented with
10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), penicillin (100 units/mL),
and streptomycin (100 units/mL) at 37°C in a humidified
atmosphere of 5% CO2. Cells were cultured in phenol redfree medium supplemented with 5% charcoal-stripped
FBS (CS-FBS) at least 24 hours before experimental
treatment. A siRNA targeting NFATc1 (sc-29412; Santa
Cruz Biotechnology) or a non-silencing control siRNA
(sc-37007; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was transfected at
a final concentration of 20-80 nM into the bladder cancer
lines, using GeneJuice (Novagen). We obtained CsA and
FK506 from Abcam.

Western blotting
Protein extraction and western blotting were
performed, as described previously [28, 34, 35]
with minor modifications. We also used a nuclear
and cytoplasmic extraction reagent kit (NE-PER,
ThermoScientific) for obtaining separate nuclear
and cytoplasmic fractions. Equal amounts of protein
(30–50 μg) obtained from cell extracts were separated in
10% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gel

Cell proliferation
We used MTT assay to assess cell viability, as
described previously [34]. Briefly, cells (1–3 x 103)
seeded in 96-well tissue culture plates were incubated
with DMEM supplemented with CS-FBS in the

electrophoresis (PAGE) and transferred to polyvinylidene
difluoride membrane (Immun-Blot PVDF Membrane,
Bio-Rad) by electroblotting. Specific antibody binding
was detected, using an anti-NFATc1 antibody (clone 7A6;
dilution 1:500; Abcam), an anti-COX-2 (dilution 1:2000;
Cayman Chemical), or an anti-GAPDH antibody (clone
6C5; dilution 1:5000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and a
secondary antibody (mouse IRDye 680LT or rabbit IRDye
800CW, LI-COR), followed by scanning with an infrared
imaging system (Odyssey, LI-COR).

instructions. An equal volume of the zymogram sample
buffer (Bio-Rad) was added to the concentrated medium
followed by 10% SDS-PAGE in a gel containing 0.1%
gelatin (Sigma). After electrophoresis, the gel was rinsed
with a renaturing buffer (Bio-Rad) for 60 minutes to remove
SDS, incubated overnight in a developing buffer (Bio-Rad)
at 37°C with shaking, and stained with 0.25% Coomassie
Brilliant Blue R-250 (Bio-Rad). MMP activities were
detected as non-staining regions in the gel, using ChemiDoc
XRS+ System (Bio-Rad).

Colony formation

Immunofluorescent staining

Cells (1 x 103) seeded in 6-well plates and cultured
in the presence or absence of CsA or FK506 were allowed
to grow until colonies in the control well were easily
distinguishable. The cells were then fixed with methanol
and stained with 0.1% crystal violet in phosphatebuffered saline (PBS). The number of colonies and their
areas were quantitated using ImageJ software (National
Institute of Health).

Cells plated onto 8-well chamber slides (NuncLabTek, Thermo Scientific) were cultured in DMEM with 5%
CS-FBS containing ethanol, CsA, or FK506 for 24 hours. At
the end of the drug treatment, the adherent cells were rinse
twice with PBS and then fixed by 4% paraformaldehyde.
The cells were blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin
for 1  hour at 37°C, and a primary antibody (NFATc1;
clone 7A6; dilution 1:50; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was
added and incubated overnight at 4°C. 4’,6’-diamidino2-phenylindole (DAPI) was used to visualize nuclei.
Fluorescence images were acquired with a fluorescence
microscopy (EVOS FL Auto, Life Technologies).

Cell migration
In order to evaluate the ability of cell migration,
a scratch wound healing assay was performed. Cells at
a density of 90–100% confluence in 6-well plates were
scratched manually with a sterile 200 μl plastic pipette
tip, cultured in the presence or absence of CsA or FK506
for 24 hours, fixed with methanol, and stained with 0.1%
crystal violet in PBS. The width of the wound area was
quantitated, using ImageJ.

Apoptosis and cell cycle analysis
The TUNEL assay was performed on cell-burdening
coverslips, using the DeadEnd Fluorometric TUNEL
system (Promega), followed by counterstaining for
DNA with DAPI. Apoptotic index was determined in the
cells visualized by the fluorescence microscopy (EVOS
FL Auto). For cell cycle analysis, flow cytometry was
performed. Cells (1 x 106/10-cm dish) were cultured in
medium supplemented with CS-FBS containing ethanol,
CsA, or FK506 for 24 hours, harvested with trypsin, fixed
in 70% ethanol, and stained with propidium iodide (PI)
buffer (50 μg/mL) for 60 minutes. Cellular PI content
was measured on a Guava PCA-96 Base SystemTM flow
cytometer (EMD Millipore) equipped with a green laser at
532 nm wavelength. Data were analyzed, using the Guava
Cell Cycle software (EMD Millipore).

Cell invasion
Cell invasiveness was determined, using a Matrigel
(60 μg; BD Biosciences)-coated transwell chamber
(8.0  μm pore size polycarbonate filter with 6.5 mm
diameter; Corning), as described previously [34]. Briefly,
cells (5 x 104) in 100 μL of serum-free medium were
added to the upper chamber of the transwell, whereas 600
μL of medium containing 5% FBS was added to the lower
chamber. The media in both chambers contained ethanol,
CsA, or FK506. After incubation for 24 hours at 37°C in
a CO2 incubator, invaded cells were fixed, stained with
0.1% crystal violet, and counted under a light microscope.

Mouse xenograft model
Animal protocols in accordance with the National
Institute of Health Guidelines for the Care and Use of
Experimental Animals were approved at our institution.
UMUC3 (1 x 106 cells/100 μL/site) resuspended in
Matrigel (BD Biosciences) were subcutaneously injected
into the flank of 6-week-old male immunocompromised
NOD-SCID mice (Johns Hopkins Animal Resources).
Treatment was initiated when the tumor volume reached
100 mm3. Mice intraperitoneally received 30 mg/kg/day
CsA, 3 mg/kg/day FK506, or vehicle control (corn oil)

Gelatin zymography
The gelatinolytic activity of MMPs was determined
by SDS-PAGE gelatin zymography. Cells at a density of
60–70% confluence in 10-cm dish were cultured in serumfree medium containing ethanol, CsA, or FK506 for 24 hours
at 37°C in a CO2 incubator. The conditioned medium was
concentrated using Amicon Ultra-4 centrifugal filter units
(30 kDa, Millipore) according to the manufacturer’s

We retrieved bladder tissue specimens obtained
by transurethral resection or cystectomy performed at
the Johns Hopkins Hospital and University of Rochester
Medical Center. Appropriate approval from the
institutional review board at each institution was obtained
before construction and use of the TMA. Bladder TMAs,
consisting of 65 cases of muscle-invasive high-grade
urothelial carcinoma, were constructed from formalin fixed
paraffin embedded specimens, as described previously
[36]. All these patients, including 51 men and 14 women
with a mean/median age of 64.5/66 years (range: 40–89
years) and a mean/median follow-up of 35.4/16 months
(range: 2–268 months), ultimately underwent cystectomy.
None of the patients had received therapy with radiation
or anti-cancer drugs prior to the collection of the tissues
included in the TMAs.
Immunohistochemical staining was performed
on the sections (5 μm thick) from the bladder TMAs or
mouse xenograft tumors, as described previously [34–36].
Briefly, after deparaffinization, hydration, and antigen
retrieval, samples were incubated overnight at 4°C with
a primary antibody to NFATc1 (clone 7A6; dilution
1:50; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or Ki-67 (clone 309; prediluted; Ventana) and then with a broad spectrum
secondary antibody (Invitrogen). All stains were manually
quantified by a single pathologist (H.M.) blinded to sample
identify. For NFATc1 staining in the bladder TMAs, the
German immunoreactive scores calculated by multiplying
the percentage of immunoreactive cells (0% = 0; 1–10%
= 1; 11–50% = 2; 51–80% = 3; 81–100% = 4) by staining
intensity (negative = 0; weak = 1; moderate = 2; strong = 3)
were considered negative (0; 0–1), weakly positive (1+;
2–4), moderately positive (2+; 6–8), and strongly positive
(3+; 9–12).

Statistical analysis
The Fisher exact test and the χ2 test were used to
evaluate the associations between categorized variables.
The numerical data were compared by Student’s
t-test. Correlations between variables were determined
by Spearman’s correlation analysis. Survival rates in
patients were calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method and
comparison was made by log-rank test. P values less than
0.05 were considered to be statistically significant.
