ABSTRACT
CD133 has been shown to be an important stem cell factor that promotes glioma
progression. However, the mechanism for CD133-mediated glioma progression has
yet to be fully elucidated. In this study, we found that CD133 mRNA expression was
a prognostic marker in three independent glioma patient cohorts, corroborating a
putative role for CD133 in glioma progression. Importantly, we found that CD133
expression in glioma was highly correlated with the expression of HOX gene stem
cell factors (HOXA5, HOXA7, HOXA10, HOXC4 and HOXC6). The expression of these
HOX genes individually was significantly associated with survival. Interestingly,
the prognostic significance of CD133 was dependent on the expression level of HOX
genes, and vice versa. CD133 (p = 0.021) and HOXA7 (p = 0.001) were independent
prognostic markers when the three glioma patient cohorts were combined (n = 231).
Our results suggest that HOX genes may play a more important role in progression
of glioma when CD133 expression is low. Furthermore, we showed that low-level
expression of LIM2 in CD133-high glioma was associated with poorer survival,
suggesting that LIM2 could be a therapeutic target for glioma expressing a high
level of CD133. Connectivity mapping identified vinblastine and vincristine as agents
that could reverse the CD133/HOX genes/LIM2-signature, and we confirmed this by
in vitro analysis in glioma cell lines, demonstrating that CD133 and HOX genes
were co-expressed and could be downregulated by vincristine. In conclusion, our
data show that CD133 and HOX genes are important prognostic markers in glioma
and shed light on possible treatment strategies for glioma expressing a high level
of CD133.

INTRODUCTION

glioma stem cells (GSCs) have been shown to be resistant to
conventional therapies, leading to high treatment failure and
recurrence in patients with unresectable glioblastoma [4].
Several genes and pathways have been linked to GSCs,
such as Notch, bone morphogenetic proteins, NF-kB, Wnt,
epidermal growth factor, and Shh [4].
Another Two GSC-linked genes are CD133 and nestin;
CD133, also known as Prominin-1, is a glycoprotein that is
encoded by the PROM1 gene. Glioblastoma multiforme
cells grown in neurosphere culture were CD133- and nestin-

Glioma is the most common type of primary brain
tumor. Of the gliomas, grade III astrocytoma and grade IV
glioblastoma are highly malignant, and afford patients a
very poor prognosis, with only around 10% surviving for
more than five years [1, 2]. Increasing evidence indicates
that stem cell signaling plays an important role in the
development of gliomas, thereby presenting a potential
therapeutic target for their treatment [3]. Most importantly,

positive and capable of tumor formation in vivo, while 2-D
cultured counterparts lacked expression and malignancy
when intracranially implanted in nude mice  [5]. CD133
plays an integral role in cancer progression by maintenance
of stem cell properties of cancer cells, such as their ability
to self-renew [6]. CD133 activates the Akt pathway to
increase cellular resistance to chemotherapy [7], while it also
promotes cancer cell self-renewal and growth through JNK
signaling [8]. Prognostic values of CD133 expression have
been shown in lung cancer [9], gastric cancer [10], colon
cancer [11], esophageal cancer [12], thyroid cancer [13],
pancreatic cancer [14] and ovarian cancer [15].
Almost a decade ago, a correlation between
CD133-positivity in glioma specimens and poor
patient prognosis was reported [16], and its prognostic
significance in glioma has since been demonstrated in
two independent meta-analyses [17, 18]. Molecular
mechanisms of CD133-mediated glioma progression have
been further revealed recently. CD133 overexpression
inhibited chemotherapy-induced apoptosis in glioma cell
lines in vitro [19, 20]. CD133-mediated temozolomide
resistance in glioma cells was shown to be dependent
on the activation of Notch and Shh pathways [21], while
CD133 was shown to confer resistance to multiple
chemotherapeutic agents via upregulation of CD90,
CD44, nestin, Msi1 and MELK [20], and the Akt and
NF-kB pathways [22]. The self-renewing property of
CD133-positive cells was dependent on the activity of
Akt [23, 24] and Notch pathways [25], and was enhanced
in a hypoxic environment via HIF-1a [26]. SirT1, which
plays an important role in governing the radiosensitivity of
glioma cells, is a downstream target of CD133 [27].
The HOX gene family consists of highly
conserved hoemodomain transcription factors that, when
overexpressed, promote glioma initiating potential, poor
prognosis and chemotherapeutic drug resistance [28].
Epigenetic alterations resulted in aberrant expression of
HOX genes at its transcriptional level [28]. LIM2, lens
intrinsic membrane protein 2, has been shown to maintain
cytoskeletal integrity, cell morphology and intercellular
communication in mouse lenses [29], but little was known
about the role of LIM2 in cancer or in glioma.
In this study, we aim to identify genes that are
co-expressed with CD133 in human glioma specimens, and
to investigate how these co-expressed genes interact with
CD133 and influence its prognostic value. Lastly, we aim to
identify small molecules that could reverse the expression
of CD133 and its associated genes.

cohorts with survival data available. In GSE4271 (n = 77;
Figure 1A), GSE4412 (n = 74; Figure 1B) and GSE7696
(n = 80; Figure 1C), a high level expression of CD133 in
the brain tumor was significantly associated with shorter
survival. Similar results were obtained using Cox-regression
analysis (Table 1); patients whose brain tumors expressed
a higher level of CD133 had a significantly higher risk of
progression or death in GSE4271, GSE4412 and GSE7696.
When the three cohorts were combined, high-level expression
of CD133 was significantly associated with a shorter survival
time (hazard ratio of 1.81, a 95% confidence interval of
1.33 – 2.45 and a p-value of < 0.001). Patients whose tumors
expressed a high level of CD133 had a mean survival
time of 25.7 months compared to 45.7 months for patients
whose tumors expressed a low-level of CD133 (Figure 1D;
p < 0.001). The association between high level of CD133
and shorter survival was observed in patients regardless of
whether temozolomide was added to radiotherapy as shown
in Supplementary Figure 1.

The association between CD133 expression and
tumor grade
With the exception of GSE7696, all other five brain
tumor patient datasets included in the current study provided
information on tumor grade. The association between
CD133 and tumor grade was tested in the combined cohort
(with only five cohorts, omitting GSE7696) by Chi-Square
analysis, and we found a significant correlation between
CD133 expression and tumor grade (Figure 2; p < 0.001).

Identification of CD133 co-expressed genes in
glioma patient datasets
Upon analysis of probeset expression patterns
in three independent brain tumor patient cohorts
with survival data available (GSE4271, GSE4412
and GSE7696) stratified into CD133-high and –low
subgroups, we found altered expression of several genes
from the HOX family to be common to all three cohorts.
HOXA5, HOXA7, HOXA10, HOXC4 and HOXC6 were
significantly differentially expressed among CD133-high
and CD133-low tumors in all three independent patient
cohorts, and were selected for further study. As shown
in Tables 2A, 2B and 2C, expression of CD133 and the
five HOX family genes were significantly correlated in
GSE4271, GSE4412 and GSE7696, respectively.

RESULTS

HOX genes have been shown to play an important
role in brain malignancies, with multiple HOX genes being
found to be overexpressed in glioblastoma multiforme, the
most aggressive glial tumor of the brain [30]. HOXA9 and
HOXA10 genes were associated with a shorter survival in
pediatric high-grade glioma patient samples [31], while

elevated HOXA9 and HOXA10 gene methylation was
associated with an increased survival probability [32].
We went on to investigate whether the five commonly
differentially expressed HOX genes were prognostic
factors in the combined patient cohort for which survival
data was available. As shown in Figure 3A, patients whose
tumors expressed a high level of HOXA5 had a mean
survival time of 26.3 months, compared to 44.9 months
for those patients whose tumors expressed a low level
of HOXA5 (Figure 3A; p = 0.001). Similarly, elevated

results suggest that the five HOX genes identified to be
co-expressed with CD133 are also prognostic factors in
brain tumor patients.

The prognostic significance of CD133 in patients
with differential expression of HOX genes
Having determined that CD133 expression is highly
correlated with the expression of HOX genes, and that
HOX genes themselves confer prognostic significance
in brain tumor patients, we went on to further investigate
the prognostic value of CD133 in brain tumors expressing
different levels of HOX genes. The mean survival time and
95% CI for different patterns of expression for different
genes are listed in Supplementary Table 2.

further investigate the prognostic significance of LIM2,
and found that a low level of LIM2 was significantly
correlated with a shorter survival time in patients with
brain tumors (Figure 6A; p = 0.005). LIM2-low patients
had a mean survival time of 25.3 months while LIM2high patients had a mean survival time of 43.1 months.
Expression of CD133 was significantly associated with
survival in both LIM2-low (Figure 6B; p = 0.005) and
LIM2-high (Figure 6C; p = 0.017) patients. However, in
a different configuration, the association between LIM2
and survival was only observed in CD133-high patients
(Figure 6E; p = 0.040), but not in CD133-low patients
(Figure 6D; p = 0.155). Importantly, CD133 expression
and LIM2 expression were independent prognostic
markers in brain tumor patients as shown by multivariate
Cox regression analysis (Table 4).

CD133 and HOXA7 genes are independent

Multivariate Cox regression was performed to
investigate whether CD133 expression and the expression
of HOX genes identified in this study are independent
prognostic factors. As shown in Table 3, by a forward
stepwise approach with an entry limit of p < 0.05, only
CD133 expression (p = 0.021) and HOXA7 expression
(p = 0.001) were independent prognostic markers in brain
tumor patients.

Since a high level of CD133 was associated with
a shorter survival in brain tumor patients, we sought to
identify additional genes that could be used to further
augment the predictive power of CD133, or to identify
potential therapeutic targets for this group of patients
with poor prognosis. By comparing CD133-high patients
who were still alive and those who were deceased at
data collection, we found that LIM2 expression was
significantly differentially expressed. We went on to

We have previously shown that VEGFa is a

sensitivity.

DISCUSSION
In the present study, we demonstrated that CD133
overexpression predicts poor prognosis in patients with
glioma. Importantly, for the first time, we showed that
CD133 expression was highly correlated with expression
of several HOX genes. These HOX genes are themselves
prognostic markers in glioma, while the prognostic value
for CD133 and HOX genes are mostly interdependent,
with the exception of HOXA7. Moreover, we have
identified that analysis of LIM2 expression could be
used to further augment the prognostication of patients
in the at-risk CD133-high subgroup. CD133 was also
associated with VEGFa expression, suggesting a possible
role of CD133 in promoting angiogenesis. Further analysis
suggests that several chemotherapeutic agents may reverse
the expression of CD133 and HOX genes.
An expression signature dominated by HOX genes
and CD133 was a predictor for poor survival in glioma
patients treated with concomitant chemoradiotherapy [34],
suggesting that these genes may interact with one
another. Multiple HOX genes have been shown to
be overexpressed in glioma and confer prognostic
value [30, 35], while HOXA10 has been shown to play a
role in drug resistance and tumor recurrence [36]. In the
present study, we found that HOXA5, HOXA7, HOXA10,
HOXC4 and HOXC6 are prognostic markers in glioma
patients. Interestingly, CD133 expression only confers
prognostic value in patients expressing a low level of
HOX genes, while expression of HOX genes confers
prognostic value in patients expressing a low level of
CD133, suggesting that the overexpression of either
CD133 or HOX genes may be sufficient to drive glioma
progression, while overexpression of both of CD133 and
HOX genes may only slightly further enhance progression
potential. Importantly, we found that CD133 and HOXA7
expressions were independent factors for predicting
patient survival, suggesting that HOXA7 expression could
add further value to the prognostic significance of CD133
expression. In view of this, CD133 or CD133 and HOX
genes should be tested in clinical trial to evaluate whether

LIM2-signature
Having shown that overexpression of CD133 and
HOX genes and suppression of LIM2 were markers of
poor prognosis, we used connectivity mapping to identify
molecules that could reverse the expression of these genes.
In the analysis, we found that the three chemotherapeutic
agents most likely to reverse the gene expression profile
identified were vinblastine (p < 0.001), vincristine
(p < 0.001) and epirubicin (p < 0.001).

The expression of CD133 and HOX genes in
glioma cell lines
mRNA expression of CD133 and HOX genes
was tested in two glioma cell lines, U251 and U87. We
found that CD133 (Figure 8A), HOXA5 (Figure 8B),
HOXA7 (Figure 8C), HOXC4 (Figure 8D) and HOXC6
(Figure 8E) were significantly higher in U251 cells then
in U87 cells (P < 0.001; Figure 8). This result supports
our analysis in human glioma patient cohorts in which
these genes are significantly correlated with each other.
HOXA10 mRNA was not detected in U87 or in U251
cells. Importantly, we also confirmed the results of
connectivity mapping, whereby treatment of U251 and
U87 cells with vincristine for 24 hours downregulated the
expression of CD133 (Figure 8A), HOXA5 (Figure 8B),
HOXA7 (Figure 8C), HOXC4 (Figure 8D) and HOXC6
(Figure 8E). Furthermore, we found that U251 cells, which
express higher level of CD133 and HOX genes were more
sensitive to vincristine treatment than U87 cells in terms
of cell viability (Figure 8F) and cell apoptosis (Figure 8G).
These results suggest that CD133 and HOX genes can be
downregulated by vincristine, and that a higher expression

the novel intervention could be effective specifically in
this subgroup of glioma patients.
We have also identified LIM2 as a factor that could
further predict survival in patients with CD133-high glioma.
Little is known about the LIM2 gene. A comparative analysis
of wild-type and LIM2-deficient mice revealed that LIM2
may have a role in maintaining cytoskeletal integrity, cell
morphology and intercellular communication within lenses
[29]. However, to the best of our knowledge, there seems to
be no prior evidence implicating an involvement of LIM2
in cancer. On the other hand, there is evidence regarding
the involvement of LIM2 in human brain development [37],
so it is conceivable that dysregulation of LIM2 expression

could manifest a malignant phenotype in brain cells.
Further investigations are required to understand how LIM2
interacts with CD133 in glioma progression.
Several chemotherapeutic agents, namely vinblastine,
vincristine, and epirubicin, were identified through
connectivity mapping for their effect in reversing the
CD133/HOX genes/LIM2 poor prognostic signature.
Vinblastine has activity in pediatric low-grade gliomas [38].
However, its activity in adult human gliomas has not been
studied. Vincristine has been shown to be effective in
treating gliomas [39] and is one of the chemotherapeutic
agents in a standard regimen (procarbazine, lomustine
and vincristine) for the treatment of low-grade gliomas

requiring postsurgical adjuvant chemotherapy [40]. In
high-grade gliomas, vincristine in combination with
procarbazine and lomustine was found to be comparable
to temozolomide in terms of efficacy endpoints [41].
Since both vinblastine and vincristine are alkaloid-type
chemotherapeutic agents that target microtubule dynamics
through binding to tubulin, it is surprising that connectivity
mapping suggested that they might regulate CD133, HOX
genes and LIM2. Epirubicin acts through effects on DNA.
It was encouraging that our in vitro analysis of cellular
response to vincristine treatment supported our clinical
cohort data, whereby the cells rich in the identified
markers (U251) were significantly more susceptible to
the cytotoxic properties of vincristine than the cells that
expressed those markers at a relatively lower level (U87).
It would be interesting to confirm this finding in clinical
trials with CD133 as biomarker for patient stratification on
which chemotherapeutic agents should be given.
Patients with glioma, in general, have poor
prognosis compared to other types of solid tumors. In
the present study, we have identified that a subgroup of
patients with high level expression of CD133 and HOX
genes had even worse prognosis than those with different
expression patterns, suggesting the ineffectiveness of
current treatment modalities to these patients. Whether
reversing expression of these genes could be a novel
therapeutic approach to prolong survival for this group of
patients requires further investigation.

Extraction of clinical and microarray gene
expression data from glioma patient datasets
Three glioma patient datasets, GSE4271 [42],
GSE4412 [43] and GSE7696 [34] were identified in the Gene
Expression Omnibus (GEO) Database; datasets compiled
using the HG-U133 microarray platform, and comprising
> 70 patients for whom survival data were available, were
included in this study. The patient characteristics for these
three datasets are listed in Supplementary Table 1. Three
other glioma patient datasets, GSE4290 [44], GSE16011 [45]
and GSE52009, all of which comprise stage and expression
data, were also included. Microarray gene expression data
were retrieved from the data matrixes deposited to the GEO
database by the original authors. R scripting was used to
extract the expression values from probesets of CD133,
HOXA5, HOXA7, HOXA10, HOXC4, HOXC6 and LIM2,
and the clinical data from the data matrixes downloaded
from GEO as previously described [46].

Patient stratification
Expression levels were divided into four groups
using quartile as the cut-off points. Expression levels were
further divided into high and low levels using median
expression level as the cut-off point for survival analysis.

Correlations of gene expression levels and
clinical data

Identification of genes co-expressed with CD133
The gene expression patterns of patients in the CD133high and CD133-low subgroups were compared. Probesets
that were differentially expressed between these two subgroups
were identified by 2-sample Welch’s T-test, avoiding the type
I error due to unequal variances of the values of probesets
between these two subgroups. Briefly, a Welch’s t test was
applied to each probeset corresponding to a particular gene
in the data matrix using our own Java application, MyStats. P
values and the differential expression in fold changes for all the
probesets were generated as tab-delimited Excel worksheets
for further analysis. Genes found to be co-expressed
with CD133 were ranked by ascending p-values. The genes
found to be co-expressed with CD133 that were common to
all three patient datasets were analyzed further.

All statistical analyses were performed using
SPSS19.0. For Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, results
were compared by log-rank test. Univariate Cox regression
analysis was used to correlate the gene expression levels
and patient survival, while multivariate Cox regression
analysis was used to identify independent prognostic
factors using a forward stepwise approach with a p value
of 0.05 for inclusion. The three datasets with survival
status available were combined into one to increase the
sample size for detailed analysis. The associations between
expression levels of genes were tested by Spearman’s
rank test. The association between tumor grade and gene
expression was tested by Chi-Square test.

Identification of gene target for patients with
brain tumors overexpressing CD133

1 μg RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA
using High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit
(Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Each reverse transcription mix consisted of
RT Buffer, dNTP Mix, RT Random Primers, MultiScribeTM
Reverse Transcriptase, nuclease-free H2O and RNA
samples. RT-PCR was carried out in a C1000 TouchTM
Thermal Cycler (Bio-Rad) following the recommended
thermal cycle program (25°C for 10 min, 37°C for
120 min, and 85°C for 5 min). cDNA products were stored
in –80°C prior to use.

Patients who overexpressed CD133 were stratified
into two groups based on mortality. Differential expressions
of different probesets between patients in the CD133-highalive subgroup and those in the CD133-high-deceased
subgroup were identified as described above.

Identification of potential inhibitory compounds
targeting CD133/HOX genes/LIM2 glioma
(Connectivity Map)

Qualitative-PCR analysis of CD133 and HOX
genes in glioma cell lines

Gene expression connectivity mapping was
performed using Statistically Significant Connection’s
Map (sscMap) to identify candidate small molecule
compounds that may reverse the overexpression of CD133
and HOX genes and suppression of LIM2 gene [47–49].
The CD133/HOX genes/LIM2 probes were input to the
Java application sscMap [49] as a query signature, and
its association with the 6000 gene expression profiles
generated by treating cancer cells with over 1000 small
molecules were compared. The gene signature perturbation
procedure, which increases the specificity of the output
results, was applied as previously described [50]. All
the small molecular compounds that were negatively
associated with the input were sorted and ranked by their
p-value, perturbation stability and standardized connection
score. The p-value that was considered significant was set
at a stringent threshold (p = 1/1309), ensuring that the
results generated by sccMap would yield a maximum of
one false positive small molecule over the 1309 small
molecules tested in the sccMap [50].

QPCR reactions were carried out by mixing 5 μl
TaqMan® Universal PCR Master Mix (Thermo Fisher
Scientific), 4 μl H2O and 1 μl cDNA sample. QPCR
was conducted in a Mx3000P qPCR System (Agilent),
with the following thermal cycling program: 95°C for
10 min, 40 cycles at 95°C for 15 sec and 60°C for 1 min.
GAPDH was regarded as the reference gene, and relative
abundance was calculated using the comparative Ct
(2−ΔΔCt) method. Taqman qPCR probes were obtained from
Thermo Fisher Scientific; CD133 (Hs01009257_m1),
HOXA5 (Hs00430330_m1), HOXA7 (Hs00600844_m1),
HOXA10 (Hs00172012_m1), HOXC4 (Hs00538088_m1)
and HOXC6 (Hs00171690_m1); all probes spanned exons,
preventing amplification of genomic DNA, and all probes
had a PCR efficiency of 100% (± 10%) (https://www.
thermofisher.com/hk/en/home/life-science/pcr/real-timepcr/real-time-pcr-assays/why-choose-taqman-assays.html).
The QPCR experiments were repeated three times for each
batch of RNA, and three batches of RNA were extracted
from three independent cell culture experiments.

Cell culture

Cell viability and cell apoptosis upon Drug
Treatment

Two glioma cell lines, namely U87MG and U251
were used for the in vitro assays. U87MG and U251 were
obtained from ATCC. They were cultured in Dulbecco’s
Modified Eagle’s medium (Life Technologies) with 10%
fetal bovine serum (FBS, Gibco, Life Technologies) and
1% penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco, Life Technologies).
Cell cultures were maintained in a 37°C incubator with
5% CO2 and 95% air.

Glioma cell lines were seeded at a density of 3000 per
well in a 96-well plate (for MTT assay) and 3 × 105 per
well in a 6-well plate (for apoptosis assay) and were
allowed to grow for 24 hours. Vincristine sulfate was
added to the culture medium and the cells were harvested
24 hours post-treatment. Cell viability was measured by
MTT assay, while cell apoptosis was measured by Alexa
Fluor 488 Annexin V/Dead Cell Apoptosis Kit (Invitrogen)
by flow cytometry.

RNA extraction and reverse transcription
polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)
Cells were grown in a 6-well cell culture dish at
a density of 2.5 × 106 cells per well for 24 hour. RNA
extraction was performed using RNeasy® Mini Kit
(QIAGEN) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Cells were disrupted by addition of lysis buffer, and the
lysate was then put into a QIAshredder spin column for
purification. RNA was eluted in the RNase-free water.
