Abstract
ALDH1þCD44þ cells are putative tumor-initiating cells (TIC) in head and neck squamous cell carcinomas
(HNC). miR-145 regulates tumorigenicity in various cancers but the breadth of its mechanistic contributions and
potential therapeutic applications are not completely known. Here, we report that ALDH1þCD44þ-HNC cells
express reduced levels of miR145. SPONGE-mediated inhibition of miR-145 (Spg-miR145) was sufﬁcient to drive
tumor-initiating characteristics in non-TICs/ALDH1CD44-negative HNC cells. Mechanistic analyses identiﬁed
SOX9 and ADAM17 as two novel miR145 targets relevant to this process. miR-145 expression repressed TICs in
HNC in a manner associated with SOX9 interaction with the ADAM17 promoter, thereby activating ADAM17
expression. Notably, the SOX9/ADAM17 axis dominated the TIC-inducing activity of miR-145. Either miR-145
suppression or ADAM17 overexpression in non-TICs/ALDH1CD44-HNC cells increased expression and
secretion of interleukin (IL)-6 and soluble-IL-6 receptor (sIL-6R). Conversely, conditioned medium from SpgmiR145–transfected non-TICs/ALDH1CD44-HNC cells was sufﬁcient to confer tumor-initiating properties in
non-TICs/ALDH1CD44-HNC and this effect could be abrogated by an IL-6–neutralizing antibody. We found
that curcumin administration increased miR-145 promoter activity, thereby decreasing SOX9/ADAM17 expression and eliminating TICs in HNC cell populations. Delivery of lentivral-miR145 or orally administered curcumin
blocked tumor progression in HNC-TICs in murine xenotransplant assays. Finally, immunohistochemical
analyses of patient specimens conﬁrmed that an miR-145low/SOX9high/ADAM17high phenotype correlated
with poor survival. Collectively, our results show how miR-145 targets the SOX9/ADAM17 axis to regulate
TIC properties in HNC, and how altering this pathway may partly explain the anticancer effects of curcumin.
By inhibiting IL-6 and sIL-6R as downstream effector cytokines in this pathway, miR-145 seems to suppress
a paracrine signaling pathway in the tumor microenvironment that is vital to maintain TICs in HNC. Cancer Res;

subpopulation of cells termed tumor-initiating cells (TIC),
which possess stem-like properties, were shown to be
enriched after therapeutic treatments and presumably contribute to the high rate of relapse and metastasis of HNC
tumors (2). Recent reports suggested that CD44 or ALDH1
could be the markers to identify the TICs from HNC (3).
ALDH1þCD44þ-HNC cells not only present elevated epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers but also are
highly metastatic, tumorigenic, and resistant to radiotherapy and chemotherapy (4). Thus, an effective therapeutic
approach targeting these ALDH1þCD44þ-HNC cells may
help to improve current treatment regimens for HNC-related
malignancies.
miRNAs have recently been linked to regulate the properties of TICs or cancer stem cells (CSC; ref. 5). miR145
modulates embryonic stem cell differentiation by simultaneously regulating multiple genes involved in stem-like
properties, including KLF4, OCT4, and SOX2 (6). miR145 is
also a tumor-suppressive miRNA that has been shown to be
involved in tumor growth and metastasis in several types
of cancer (7), as well as modulate TIC- and CSC-like

properties in lung adenocarcinoma and glioblastoma cells
(8, 9). However, the roles of miR145 as well as its downstream targets in the regulation of ALDH1þCD44þ-HNC cells
remain unclear.
SOX9 (SRY-box containing gene 9) seems to contribute to
tumor development through cell-cycle regulatory mechanisms (10), and coexpression of SOX9 and Slug was shown to
confer extensive self-renewal capacity upon dormant micrometastasis-forming cells, thereby allowing these cells to
spawn macrometastasis (11). ADAM17 (a disintegrin and
metalloprotease 17) is a member of the metalloproteinase
family and is upregulated in a variety of tumors. Functionally, ADAM17 has been shown to contribute to tumor
formation, proliferation, invasion, and antiapoptosis (12–
15). In this report, we applied a bioinformatics-based analysis on HNC-TICs and HNC non-TICs, and showed that
miR145 as well as its downstream targets, SOX9 and
ADAM17, play critical roles in regulating tumor-initiation
properties in HNC cells. We showed direct targeting by
miR145 to the 30 -untranslated region (UTR) regions of SOX9
and ADAM17 in HNC-TICs, and further showed a direct
interaction between Sox9 and ADAM17-promoter by CHIP
assay. In addition, it has been reported that ADAM17 mediates the shedding of the IL-6-receptor (IL-6R), which produces a soluble-form of IL-6R (sIL-6R) that could induce a
transactivation of the IL-6-pathway in a paracrine manner
(16). Notably, elevated IL-6 and sIL-6R levels were induced
by miR145-knockdown ALDH1CD44-HNC cells, coknockdown of ADAM17 reversed this effect. Moreover, we
showed that the secretion levels of IL-6 and sIL-6R from
ALDH1þCD44þ or SPONGE-mediated miR145-inhibitionALDH1CD44 cells, as part of the microenviromental
niches, are vital to maintain the self-renewal and tumorigenic properties in HNC. Our studies illustrate a novelregulatory role of the miR145-SOX9/ADAM17 signaling axis
in the regulation of TICs-properties in HNC.

Materials and Methods
Reagents
Curcumin was purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. and
was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as a stock
solution of 100 mmol/L. Just before use, curcumin was
further diluted in culture medium to the appropriate ﬁnal
concentrations.
Tumorsphere-forming assay
Tumor cells were dissociated and cultured as tumorspheres in modiﬁed Dulbecco's Modiﬁed Eagle Medium
(DMEM)/F-12 supplemented with N2 (R&D Systems), 10
ng/mL EGF (Invitrogen), 10 ng/mL basic ﬁbroblast growth
factor (bFGF; Invitrogen), and penicillin/streptomycin at 103
live cells/low-attachment 6-well plate (Corning Inc.), and
the medium was changed every other day until the tumor
sphere formation was observed in about 2 weeks. For serial
passage of spheroid cells, single cells were obtained from
accurtase-treated spheroids and the cell density of passage
was 1,000 cells/mL in the serum-free medium as described
earlier.

ALDEFLUOR assay
An ALDEFLUOR assay kit was purchased from StemCell
Technologies, Inc.. For this assay, 1  105 cells were suspended in 50 mL of assay buffer, and ALDEFLUOR was added
to the cell suspensions for a ﬁnal concentration of 1 mmol/L.
For ALDH1 inhibitor control, diethylaminobenzaldehyde
(DEAB) was added to a ﬁnal concentration of 150 mmol/L.
Cells were then incubated at 37 C for 45 minutes and were
stained with 7-aminoactinomycin D (7-AAD) on ice for
5 minutes. After washing the cells with PBS, live cells
(7AAD-) positive for green ﬂuorescence were analyzed by
ﬂow cytometry (FACSCalibur; BD Biosciences) to compare
the ﬂuorescence intensity of the DEAB-treated samples.
High ﬂuorescence was associated with high ALDH activity
(ALDHþ cells).
In vivo GFP imaging of tumor growth
All procedures involving animals were in accordance with
the institutional animal welfare guideline of Taipei Veterans
General Hospital (Taipei, Taiwan). Cells were subcutaneously injected into 8-week-old immunocompromised C57BL/6J
mice (BALB/c strain). In vivo GFP imaging was conducted
using an illuminating device [LT-9500 Illumatool TLS
equipped with an excitation illuminating source (470 nm)
and ﬁlter plate (515 nm)]. Tumor sizes were measured using
calipers, and their volumes were calculated according to the
following formula: (length  width2)/2; these results were
subsequently analyzed using Image Pro-plus software.
Immunohistochemistry
This research follows the tenets of the Declaration of
Helsinki, and all samples were obtained after informed
consent from the patients. Patients' tissue samples with
different stages of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and
neck (HNSCC) were spotted on glass slides for immunohistochemical (IHC) staining (Supplementary Table S4). After
deparafﬁnization and rehydration, tissue sections were
processed with antigen retrieval by 1 Trilogy diluted in
H2O (Biogenics) with heating. The slides were immersed in
3% H2O2 for 10 minutes and washed with PBS 3 times.
Tissue sections were blocked with serum (Vestastain Elite
ABC kit; Vector Laboratories) for 30 minutes, then incubated with the primary antibody in PBS solution at room
temperature for 2 hours. Tissue slides were washed with
PBS and incubated with biotin-labeled secondary antibody
for 30 minutes, then incubated with streptavidin–horseradish peroxidase conjugates for 30 minutes, and washed with
PBS 3 times. Tissue sections were then immersed with
chromogen 3-30 -diaminobenzidine plus H2O2 substrate
solution (Vector DBA/Ni substrate kit, SK-4100; Vector
Laboratories) for 10 minutes. Hematoxylin was applied for
counterstaining (Sigma Chemical Co.). The tumor sections
were mounted with a cover slide with Gurr (BDH Laboratory
Supplies) and examined under a microscope. Pathologists
scoring the immunohistochemistry were blinded to the
clinical data. The interpretation was done in 5 high-power
views for each slide, and 100 cells per view were counted for
analysis.

Targeting HNC-TICs by Curcumin-Activated miR145

Statistical analysis
Statistical Package for the Social Sciences software version 13.0 (SPSS, Inc.) was used for all statistical analyses.
The Student t test was used to determine statistical significance of the differences between experimental groups;
P values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. The level of statistical signiﬁcance was set at 0.05 for
all tests.

Results
miR145 depletion promotes cell proliferation and
enhances tumor growth in non-TICs/ALDH1CD44HNCs cells
The ALDH1þ, CD44þ, and sphere-forming HNC cells have
been shown to exhibit TICs stem-like properties (4), and
these markers have been used to identify HNC-derived TICs
(HNC-TIC). To identify the miRNA(s) involved in the regulation of TICs properties in HNC-TICs, we evaluated and
compared the miRNA expression proﬁles in 3 pairs of HNC
cell populations (ALDH1þ vs. ALDH1, CD44þ vs. CD44, and
sphere-forming vs. parental) derived from 2 patient samplederived HNC-cell lines (HNC-1 and HNC-2) and an immortalized HNC cell line (FaDu). The candidate miRNAs that
were either upregulated more than 2-fold or downregulated
more than 50% in all ALDH1þ, CD44þ, and sphere-forming
cells, in comparison with their counterparts, were considered
for further analysis (Fig. 1A and Supplementary Fig. S1A). The
data revealed 40 miRNAs, including miR145, that were consistently upregulated or downregulated in ALDH1þ, CD44þ,
and sphere-forming HNC cells (Fig. 1A and Supplementary
Fig. S1A). Among those candidates, miR145 has been previously linked to regulating the maintenance of stem-like
properties in both malignant tumors and embryonic stem
cells (6, 17). To further investigate whether miR145 plays a
role in the identity of HNC-TICs, the quantitative real-time
PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis were used to conﬁrm that miR145
levels were low in ALDH1þCD44þ and sphere-forming HNC
cells but high in ALDH1CD44 and parental cells (Fig. 1B,
left and middle). To evaluate the role of miR145 on cancer
initiation, we knocked down miR145 in ALDH1CD44 cells
isolated from HNC-1, HNC-2, and FaDu cells using an miRNASPONGE strategy (Fig. 1B, right), and subjected these cells to
functional and molecular analysis. As shown in Fig. 1C and D,
the sphere formation ability and the percentage of ALDH1þ
and CD44þ cells was all elevated upon miR145 knockdown
(Spg-miR145) as compared with the control (Spg-ctrl) cells.
Moreover, silencing of miR145 increased the cell proliferation
rate (Fig. 1E) and the tumor growth of ALDH1CD44-HNC
cells (Fig. 1F, left). The repopulating incident of xenografttumor in ALDH1CD44/Spg-miR145–transplanted mice
was higher than that observed in ALDH1CD44/Spg-ctrl–
transplanted animals: as few as 100 injected ALDH1CD44/
Spg-miR145 cells were capable of regenerating new tumors
in nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeﬁcient
(NOD/SCID) mice, whereas 100,000 ALDH1CD44/Spg-ctrl
cells were unable to generate xenograft tumors in NOD/SCID
mice (Fig. 1F, right). In addition, knockdown of miR145

www.aacrjournals.org

in ALDH1CD44-HNC cells increased the invasive ability
in vitro (Fig. 1G) as well as the number of metastatic tumor
nodules in vivo in tail vein-transplanted mice (Fig. 1H). These
data suggested that suppression of miR145 enables HNC cells
to acquire TICs properties.
miR145 directly targets the 30 -UTR of SOX9 and ADAM17
and suppresses the tumor-initiating properties of HNC
cells
To further show the signiﬁcance of the miR145 in regulating
the TICs properties in HNC cells, miR145 was overexpressed in
ALDH1þCD44þ-HNC cells by lentiviral-based delivery system
conjugated with GFP (pLV/miR-145; Fig. 2A, left). A scrambled
vector-transfected control (pLV/miR-Scr.) was also generated
simultaneously. The expression level of ectopic miR145 in
ALDH1þCD44þ-HNC cells was validated by qRT-PCR analysis
(Fig. 2A, right). The results of functional analysis showed that
overexpression of miR145 signiﬁcantly decreased the percentages of ALDH1þ (Fig. 2B, left) and CD44þ (Fig. 2B, right)
subsets of cells, and further suppressed sphere formation
ability (Fig. 2C, left) and invasion capacity (Fig. 2C, right) in
ALDH1þCD44þ-HNC cells, as compared with their control
cells. Animal study showed that overexpression of miR145
effectively inhibited tumor-initiating property of ALDH1þ
CD44þ cells in NOD/SCID mice (Fig. 2D). As miRNAs suppress
target gene expression through mRNA cleavage or translational repression, 3 pairwise comparisons of HNC cell populations
(ALDH1þ CD44þ vs. ALDH1 CD44, Spg-miR-145 vs. Spg-ctrl,
and sphere-forming vs. parental) were subjected to a cDNA
microarray analysis focusing on stemness-related genes, and
the results were further subjected to a prediction algorithm of
miR145 targets (Supplementary Fig. S1B). Our results identiﬁed SOX9 and ADAM17 as potential targets of miR145 that
were highly expressed in ALDH1þCD44þ, sphere-forming, and
Spg-miR145 HNC cells in relation to ALDH1CD44, parental,
and Spg-ctrl HNC cells, respectively (Supplementary Fig. S1B
and S1C). Analysis of the expression levels of miR145, SOX9,
and ADAM17 in ALDH1þCD44þ and ALDH1CD44 cell
subpopulations isolated from patient specimens revealed an
inverse correlation between miR145 and SOX9/ADAM17 (Fig.
2E). Using the Target Scan program, we predicted potential
miR145 targeting sites within the 30 -UTR of SOX9 and ADAM17
(Fig. 2F). We then constructed a series of reporter plasmids
containing either wild-type (WT), mutated (Mut), or deletedforms of the SOX9- and ADAM17-30 -UTR (Supplementary Fig.
S1D) and subjected them to luciferase reporter assays in the
presence or absence of miR145. The results show that miR145
suppressed the luciferase activities of the reporters containing
predicted miR145-targeting sites (SOX9-WT, SOX9-D1,
ADAM17-WT, ADAM17-D1, and ADAM17-D2) but not the
reporters with deleted targeting sites (Fig. 2G). Mutations
within the miR145-targeting sites also hindered the inhibitory
effect of miR145 on the reporter constructs (Fig. 2H). These
data showed that miR145 directly targets SOX9 and ADAM17
through their 30 -UTR regions. In line with these data, overexpression of miR145 in ALDH1þCD44þ-HNC cells by lentivirus-mediated transfection decreased the protein levels of SOX9
and ADAM17, whereas Spg-miR145 treatment of ALDH1

Targeting HNC-TICs by Curcumin-Activated miR145

CD44-HNC cells increased protein expression of SOX9 and
ADAM17 (Fig. 2I). Remarkably, co-knockdown of SOX9/
ADAM17 in ALDH1þCD44þ-HNC cells using SOX9- and
ADAM17-speciﬁc short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs; Fig. 2J) had
similar effects as miR145 overexpression, resulting in a reduction in sphere-forming ability (Supplementary Fig. S2A),
reduced percentages of CD44þ (Supplementary Fig. S2B) and
ALDH1þ cells (Supplementary Fig. S2C), reduced invasive
capacity (Supplementary Fig. S2D), and inhibited tumor-initiating property in ALDH1þCD44þ cells-transplanted NOD/
SCID mice (Supplementary Fig. S2E). Collectively, our results
suggest that miR145 directly targets the 30 -UTR of SOX9 and
ADAM17 to suppress their expression and repress the TIC
properties of ALDH1þ/CD44þ-HNC cells.
SOX9 directly regulates ADAM17 promoter and the
SOX9/ADAM17 axis dominates miR145-mediated EMT
and TICs properties
SOX9, a high-mobility group box transcription factor, plays
critical roles during embryogenesis, development, and differentiation (11). Recent evidence has provided a link
between SOX9 and tumor development and cancer progression (18). Herein, we found that knockdown of SOX9
decreased ADAM17 expression in ALDH1þ/CD44þ-HNC cells
(Fig. 3A), whereas overexpression of SOX9 resulted in
increased ADAM17 ALDH1/CD44-HNC cells (Fig. 3B). In
contrast, protein levels of SOX9 were not signiﬁcantly changed in ADAM17-knocked down ALDH1þ/CD44þ-HNC or
ADAM17-overexpressed ALDH1/CD44-HNC cells (Fig.
3A and B). These ﬁndings indicated that Sox9 is an upstream
molecule regulating ADAM17 expression. A luciferase reporter assay indicated that SOX9 enhanced ADAM17-promoter
(wt and del-1) activity; deletion (del-2 and del-3) or mutation
(mut) of the promoter region (506 to 503) in ADAM17promoter, however, prevented SOX9 from activating
ADAM17 promoter (Fig. 3C). By conducting chromatin
immunoprecipitation (ChIP) using an anti-Sox9 antibody
and subsequent PCR ampliﬁcation, the ADAM1 promoter
fragment was shown to be present in the immunoprecipitates
(Fig. 3D). These data conﬁrm that ADAM17 upregulation is
partly resulted from transcriptional activation of SOX9 after
directly binding on ADAM17 promoter. We next clarify the



functional involvement of miR145-SOX9/ADAM17 axis in
HNC aggressiveness. The wound-healing (Fig. 3E) and invasion abilities (Fig. 3F) of ALDH1CD44-HNC cells were
increased in Spg-miR145 HNC cells. Furthermore, individual
silencing of SOX9 or ADAM17 or co-knockdown of SOX9 and
ADAM17 in Spg-miR145–treated ALDH1CD44-HNC cells
partially counteracted with miR145-SPONGE and slightly
inhibited wound-healing and invasion abilities (Fig. 3E and
F). ALDH1þCD44þ-HNC cells were previously shown to be
present with elevated EMT markers and are of highly metastatic ability (19). With Western blotting, we showed that
Spg-miR145 induced a pattern of upregulated mesenchymallike proteins (ﬁbronectin, vimentin, and Slug) and downregulated epithelial protein (E-cadherin) in ALDH1CD44HNC cells, which were reversed by Sox9 and/or ADAM17
downregulation (Fig. 3G). Moreover, we examined the incidence of tumor metastasis in mice following the systemic
administration of ALDH1CD44-HNC cell with different
combination of Spg-miR145, shSOX9, and shADAM17 (Fig.
3G). These data indicated that the Spg-miR145–increased
incident and number of metastatic tumor nodules in the lung
and liver were suppressed by additional knockdown of Sox9
and/or ADAM17 (Fig. 3H). Combined with these data, SOX9
directly regulates ADAM17 expression, and the SOX9/
ADAM17 axis modulates miR145-mediated EMT and tumor
metastasis in HNC.
miR145 and ADAM17 mediate IL-6 inﬂammatory
cytokine and soluble IL-6 receptor secretion, which
maintains the TIC properties of HNC cells in a paracrine
manner
ADAM17 has been shown to be responsible for the ectodomain shedding of transmembrane proteins, resulting in the
release of their extracellular domains from the cell membrane
(20). For example, ADAM17-mediated shedding of the IL-6R
produces a sIL-6R that induces the transactivation of the IL-6pathway in a paracrine-manner in cells that do not express IL6R and thus are insensitive to IL-6-activation (16). To elucidate
the possible involvement of miR145 and ADAM17 in regulating
IL-6, we conducted a microarray analysis of the NCI60 tumor
cell database focusing on secreted cytokines. Our results
showed that mRNA expression of miR145, ADAM17, and

Targeting HNC-TICs by Curcumin-Activated miR145

IL-6 were closely correlated (Fig. 4A). ELISA analysis further
indicated that the secreted IL-6 and sIL-6R were low in
ALDH1CD44-HNC cells but high in ALDH1þCD44þ-HNC
cells, in which the secretion level of sIL-6R presented larger
difference than that of IL-6 (Fig. 4B, left). Clinically, patients
with recurrent HNC had increased concentration of IL-6 and
sIL-6R in serum, in comparison with patients with primary
HNC (Fig. 4B, right). Because ADAM17 is a miR145 target, we
investigated the effects of miR145 on the expression levels of
IL-6 and sIL-6R. Western blot analyses (Fig. 4C, left; Supplementary Fig. S2F) and ELISA (Fig. 4C, right) indicated that the
overexpression of miR145 suppressed the protein expression
of IL-6 in ALDH1þCD44þ cells, whereas Spg-miR145 increased
IL-6 expression in ALDH1CD44 cells. To clarify the causal
relationship between miR145, ADAM17, and the regulation of
IL-6 expression, we manipulated miR145 and ADAM17 expression levels using Spg-miR145 and shADAM17 in ALDH1
CD44-HNC cells. Western blot analyses showed that cellular
IL-6 protein levels were elevated by Spg-miR145 but that
concomitant knockdown of ADAM17 inhibited the SpgmiR145–induced increase in IL-6 protein expression, indicating that ADAM17 mediates the miR145-dependent regulation
of IL-6 (Fig. 4D). ELISAs further showed that the inhibition of
miR145 and the overexpression of ADAM17 enhanced the
levels of secreted IL-6 and sIL-6R that were detected in the
medium of ALDH1CD44 cells, and this increase was
observed to a greater extent for sIL-6R (Fig. 4E). Regardless
of whether the elevated IL-6 and sIL-6R levels were induced by
Spg-miR145, knockdown of ADAM17 reversed this effect (Fig.
4E). IL-6 has been implicated in the regulation of some TIC
properties in epithelial cancers, including human ductal breast
carcinomas (21), and the IL-6 inﬂammatory loop mediates the
resistance of breast cancer cells to HER2-targeting antibodies
(22). As such, we hypothesized that secreted IL-6 and sIL-6R
may induce TIC-like properties in HNC cells. We incubated
ALDH1CD44-HNC cells for 24 hours in the conditioned
medium (CM) derived from ALDH1þCD44þ-HNC cells
(ALDH1þCD44þ-CM) that had been transfected with or without miR145 and shADAM17, or in ALDH1þCD44þ-CM preincubated with anti-sIL-6R–neutralizing antibodies. The
ALDH1þCD44þ-CM induced the self-renewal capability,
the percentage of sphere formation, and the percentage of
side population of ALDH1CD44-HNC. These effects were
blocked by miR145 overexprssion or the anti-IL-6–neutralizing

antibody treatment (Supplementary Fig. S3A and S3B). The
conditioned medium derived from ALDH1CD44/SpgmiR145 cells (ALDH1CD44/Spg-miR145-CM) had similar
effects to ALDH1þCD44þ-CM (Fig. 4F and Supplementary Fig.
S3C). Transfection of ALDH1CD44/Spg-miR145 cells with
shADAM17 or preincubation of ALDH1CD44/Spg-miR145CM with anti-IL-6–neutralizing antibodies reduced the
enhancing effects of ALDH1CD44/Spg-miR145-CM on
self-renewal and side population of ALDH1CD44-HNC cell
(Fig. 4F and Supplementary Fig. S3C). Notably, the phosphorylation status of STAT3, an important downstream effector of
IL-6 signaling pathway, in these conditioned medium–treated
ALDH1CD44 cells was closely associated with sphere formation capacity (Fig. 4G), suggesting a role of the IL-6–STAT3
signaling in the paracrine and autocrine regulation of TICproperties. These results collectively suggest that the miR145–
ADAM17 pathway mediates the maintenance of TIC properties
in HNC in a paracrine/autocrine manner dependent on IL-6
and sIL-6R.
Curcumin increases miR145, decreases SOX9/ADAM17/
IL-6/sIL-6R, and eliminates HNC-TICs
Curcumin is known to inhibit TIC-like properties in
breast, pancreatic, brain, and colon cancers (23–27). Moreover, curcumin has been shown to suppress the self-renewal
of breast TICs (25), reduce the side population of rat glioma
cell lines (23), and promote the differentiation of glioma
TICs by inducing autophagy (28). Recently, curcumin-regulated miRNAs have been shown to be involved in the
epigenetic regulation of TICs properties in several types of
malignant cancers (29–32). However, the miRNAs that mediate curcumin-dependent regulatory mechanisms in HNCTICs remain unclear. We examined the effect of curcumin on
2 normal human oral keratinocyte (NHOK) primary cells and
TIC-like ALDH1þCD44þ-HNC cells isolated from HNC-1 and
HNC-2 cells. As shown in Fig. 5A, curcumin inhibited the
proliferation rate of ALDH1þCD44þ-HNC cells in a dosedependent manner, whereas the inhibition on NHOK cells
proliferation was limited (Fig. 5A). These data showed that
curcumin was speciﬁc and acted almost exclusive on tumor
cells, rather than normal, nontransformed cells. We then
evaluate the potential role of curcumin in modulating the
cancer stem-like properties of HNC-TICs and found that
curcumin decreased the self-renewal capacity (Fig. 5B), the

number of metastatic tumor nodules in the lung of ALDH1þ
CD44þ-HNC–transplanted mice (Supplementary Fig. S3F).
Next, we compared the curcumin-treated and nontreated
ALDH1þCD44þ-HNC cells by miRNA microarray to identify
other potential curcumin-regulated miRNAs. Curcumin
treatment if ALDH1þCD44þ-HNC cells resulted in a dosedependent increase in the levels of various miRNA, including
miR145, miR200b, miR200c, let-7a, and let-7d. Notably,
miR145 was the most responsive miRNA in curcumin-treated ALDH1þCD44þ-HNC cells (Fig. 5E). A miR145 promoterdriven reporter assay showed that curcumin increased
miR145 promoter activity in ALDH1þCD44þ-HNC cells (Fig.
5F, bottom). This ﬁnding was conﬁrmed by Northern blot
analysis, as an increased miR145 mRNA level was detected in
curcumin-treated cells (Fig. 5F, top). Importantly, curcumintreatment of ALDH1þCD44þ-HNC cells also suppressed the
protein levels of SOX9 and ADAM17, which our data implicated as targets of miR145 (Fig. 5G). Furthermore, an in vivo
tumor initiation assay showed that suppression of miR145 or
overexpression of SOX9/ADAM17 rendered as few as 100
ALDH1CD44-HNC cells capable of forming tumors by
subcutaneous injection into nude-mice (Fig. 5H). Moreover,
the Spg-miR145- and SOX9/ADAM17–mediated increase in
tumor-initiation capacity in ALDH1CD44-HNC cells was
suppressed by curcumin-treatment (Fig. 5H). To clarify the
functional involvement of curcumin and the miR145-SOX9/
ADAM17 axis in HNC aggressiveness, Spg-miR145-, SOX9-,
ADAM17-, and SOX9/ADAM17-transfected ALDH1CD44HNC cells treated with or without curcumin were subjected
to wound-healing and Transwell invasion assays. The
wound-healing and invasion abilities of ALDH1CD44HNC cells were increased in Spg-miR145-, SOX9-,
ADAM17-, and SOX9/ADAM17–transfected cells compared
with controls, whereas the Spg-miR145- and SOX9/ADAM17ependent increases in migration and invasion were suppressed by curcumin treatment (Supplementary Fig. S4A and
S4B). In line with these ﬁndings, Western blot analyses
showed that the curcumin treatment downregulated pattern
of upregulated mesenchymal-like proteins (ﬁbronectin,
vimentin, and Slug) and upregulated epithelial protein
(E-cadherin) in miR-145-knockdown ALDH1CD44 or
ALDH1þCD44þ-HNC cells in a time-dependent manner
(0, 24, 48, and 72 hours; Supplementary Fig. S4C). Furthermore, curcumin time-dependently eliminates IL-6/sIL-6R
secretion in ALDH1þCD44þ-HNC cells (Supplementary Fig.
S4D). Moreover, we examined the incidence of tumor metastasis in mice lungs and livers following the systemic administration of Spg-miR145- or SOX9/ADAM17-transfected
low

high

ALDH1CD44-HNC cells pretreated with or without curcumin. These results indicated that the incidence and number of metastatic tumor nodules were increased in animals
that received cells transfected with Spg-miR145 or SOX9/
ADAM17, whereas pretreatment with curcumin suppressed
the metastatic incidence and number of tumor nodules in
both cases (Supplementary Fig. S4E and S4F). Taken together, these results suggest that curcumin has the potential to
suppressed EMT and decrease tumor metastasis capacities
of HNC-TICs through the activation of miR145 and the
suppression of SOX9/ADAM17/IL-6/sIL-6R.
Therapeutic delivery of curcumin or miR145 to ALDH1þ
CD44þ-HNC cells-transplanted mice attenuates tumor
progression in vivo
Next, we explored the therapeutic potential of curcumin and
miR145 in immunocompromised mice bearing HNC-TIC xenograft tumors. Nude mice that were orthotopically injected with
GFP-labeled ALDH1þCD44þ-HNC cells in the neck region,
followed by intratumoral lesion injections with miR145-overexpressing lentivirus (pLV-miR-145) and shSOX9þshADAM17
or by oral gavage with curcumin (40 mg/kg/d) and control
(saline). Five weeks after the treatments, mice treated with
pLV-miR145 and shSOX9þshADAM17 showed dramatically
reduced tumor sizes in comparison with mice that received the
empty vector (pLV) or shRNA control (shLuc), and curcumin
treatment resulted in an even greater inhibition of tumor
growth (Figs. 6A and B). By monitoring the treated mice
for up to 12 weeks, we observed that administration of pLVmiR145, shSOX9þshADAM17, and curcumin prolonged animal survival, with a greater extent in LNA-miR145- and
curcumin-treated mice (Fig. 6C). Tumor sections obtained
from each treatment group were then subjected to IHC
analysis to evaluate the expression of miR145 downstream
targets. Delivery of LNA-miR145, shSOX9þshADAM17, or
curcumin to ALDH1þCD44þ-HNC–transplanted mice
reduced the expression of SOX9, ADAM17, Slug, and IL-6
(Fig. 6D and E), whereas pLV-miR145 and curcumin treatment signiﬁcantly increased miR145 miRNA expression in
the tumor samples (Fig. 6F). To investigate the therapeutic
effects of curcumin on tumor metastasis caused by the
suppression of miR145 or the overexpression of SOX9/
ADAM17, NOD/SCID (BALB/c-strain) mice were implanted
with 2  105 Spg-miR145- or SOX9þADAM17–transfected
ALDH1CD44 cells by tail vein injection, and then the mice
were treated with or without curcumin (40 mg/kg/d) by

ALDH1CD44/SOX9þADAM17–transplanted mice, and
the administration of curcumin effectively suppressed them
(Figs. 6G and H). In addition, the survival of ALDH1CD44/
Spg-miR145- and ALDH1CD44/SOX9þADAM17–transplanted mice was signiﬁcantly improved with curcumin
treatment (Fig. 6I). Collectively, our data show that miR145
and curcumin treatment impaired tumor growth, reduced
miR145 downstream target expression, suppressed metastasis, and improved the survival of HNC tumor-bearing mice.
The clinical signiﬁcance of the miR145low
SOX9highADAM17high signature in HNC patients
To validate the signiﬁcance of the miR145-SOX9/ADAM17
axis in clinical specimens, we collected paired samples of
tumor (T) and nontumor (N) tissue from patients with HNC
and subjected these samples to histologic analysis. The expression of miR145 in HNC tissues was signiﬁcantly decreased in
the tumor specimens, whereas SOX9 and ADAM17 expression
was increased relative to the nontumor tissue (Fig. 7A, top). In
line with these data, the level of miR145 expression was higher
in local (T) tumor samples but lower in lymph node metastatic
(LN) lesions, whereas SOX9/ADAM17 expression levels were
lower in local tumor samples and higher in metastatic lesions
(Fig. 7A, bottom). We further compared the expression of SOX9
and ADAM17 in a panel of HNC patient samples from nontumorous to poorly differentiated tumor specimens (Supplementary Table S4). IHC staining showed that high-grade with
poor differentiated HNC tumor tissues had high levels of SOX9
and ADAM17 expression, whereas low-grade tumor samples
presented low levels of SOX9 and ADAM17 expression (Fig. 7B).
To determine the prognostic signiﬁcance of miR145, SOX9, and
ADAM17 expression levels, a Kaplan–Meier survival analysis of
patients with HNC was conducted according to the expression
proﬁles of these genes. Patients with HNC with tumors that
expressed high levels of SOX9 and ADAM17 had a reduced
survival rate, whereas patients with high tumoral expression of
miR145 showed a better survival rate (Fig. 7C). Moreover,
patients with tumors that displayed an expression proﬁle of
miR145lowSOX9highADAM17high had a lower survival rate compared with patients harboring tumors with other proﬁles,
such as miR145highSOX9lowADAM17low (Fig. 7C). In addition,
patients with HNC with miR145lowSOX9highADAM17high
expression were also associated with greater metastatic status
(Fig. 7D). Overall, these results suggest that the reduced
expression of miR145 and elevated expression of SOX9/
ADAM17 are strongly associated with advanced-grade HNC
and a poor prognosis. Thus, the miR145lowSOX9highADAM17high
signature could be used as a predictor of disease progression and clinical outcome in patients with HNC.

Discussion
miR145 is a tumor-suppressive miRNA that inhibits tumor
growth and metastasis (33). Here, we showed that miR145 is an
important negative regulator of HNC and that suppressing
miR145 expression is crucial for maintaining the stem-like and
TICs capacities of HNC. SOX9 is a positive regulator of cancerassociated cellular signaling pathways (10, 34–36), and its
overexpression is associated with poor prognosis and patient

survival in breast and lung carcinoma (11, 37). We showed that
the overexpression of miR145 or the knockdown of SOX9 and
ADAM17 suppressed the TICs properties of ALDHþCD44þHNC cells (Fig. 2). Furthermore, ectopic overexpression of
SOX9 and ADAM17 reversed the miR145-mediated inhibition
of ALDHþCD44þ-HNC tumorigenicity. In animal models, we
conﬁrmed that miR145 suppresses tumor initiation, growth,
and metastasis through inhibiting SOX9 and ADAM17 (Fig. 6).
Finally, a miR145lowSOX9highADAM17high signature in HNC
patient-derived tumor samples correlated with a poor
patient survival rate (Fig. 7C). In addition, the conventional
anticancer drug curcumin is known to suppress cancer cells
by modulating miRNA levels (29), and our ﬁndings show that
miR145 is one of the major miRNAs upregulated in HNC in
response to curcumin (Fig. 5). Functional assays indicated
that the miR145-SOX9/ADAM17-axis mediates a curcumindependent suppression of tumor-initiating properties in
ALDH1þCD44þ-HNC both in vitro and in vivo. To our
knowledge, this is the ﬁrst report showing a miR145-targeting SOX9/ADAM17 axis in regulating TICs-properties in
HNC, and the miR145-mediated suppression of TIC properties could be partially augmented by the anticarcinogenic
effect of curcumin (Fig. 7E).
The inﬂammatory paracrine effect of IL-6/IL-6R constitutes a
critical costimulatory cytokine network and promotes cancer
stem-like properties in breast cancer, colorectal cancer, and
malignant gliomas (21, 22, 38). Recently, clinical studies showed
the importance of IL-6 and sIL-6R in tumor progression, as the
levels of IL-6 and sIL-6R are elevated in many patients with
cancer, and the IL-6/sIL-6R trans-signaling has also been shown
to play an essential role in cancer metastasis and tumor
recurrence (16, 39). ADAM17 is known to mediate the ectodomain shedding of IL-6R to generate the sIL-6R (40, 41), thereby
activating the IL-6 pathway through a process known as transsignaling (40–42). Our data indicated that apart from IL-6R
shedding, ADAM17 also increased the expression and secretion
of IL-6 (Fig. 4). In ALDH1CD44-HNC cells, the IL-6 and sIL-6R
expression and secretion, as well as the self-renewal capacity,
were increased upon treatment with conditioned medium
derived from ALDH1þCD44þ-HNC or Spg-miR145–transfected
ALDH1CD44-HNC cells and was decreased upon treatment
with shADAM17 and anti-sIL-6R–neutralizing antibodies (Supplementary Fig. S3A and S3B). Clinically, upregulation of serum
level of IL-6 and sIL-6R were both observed in recurrent and
lymph node metastatic tumor tissues compared with primary
and local tumor tissue, respectively (Fig. 4B). Moreover, in line
with previous report showing that STAT3 mediates IL-6–dependent promotion of cell proliferation and survival in breast- and
glioma stem cells (43), we found that in ALDH1CD44-HNC
cells, the phosphorylation level of STAT3 was increased upon
treatment with conditioned medium derived from SpgmiR145–transfected ALDH1CD44-HNC cells and was
decreased upon treatment with shADAM17 or IL-6–neutralizing antibody (Fig. 4G). Our date showed that the miR145ADAM17 regulates IL-6/sIL-6R trans-signaling, which involves
STAT3 activation, and paracrinally regulates the self-renewal
capacity of HNC. The miR145-low HNC-TICs paracrinally
enhance the stem-like and self-renewal properties of miR145-

Targeting HNC-TICs by Curcumin-Activated miR145

high HNC-non-TICs through IL-6 trans-signaling, and thus is
potentially turn HNC-non-TICs to HNC-TICs.
Sun and colleagues has shown that curcumin alters the
miRNA expression proﬁles in human pancreatic cancer cells
(29). The curcumin analog-CDF (diﬂuorinated-curcumin) has
also been reported to inhibit pancreatic tumor growth by
enhancing the expression of several suppressor miRNAs such
as let7, miR26a, miR21, and miR143 (27, 44). We found that
curcumin presents a greater inhibitory effect in ALDH1þ
CD44þ-HNC cells than in NHOK cells (Fig. 3). Our results
showed that curcumin-dependent activation of a miR145SOX9/ADAM17 axis might act as part of the mechanism to
suppress TICs properties in HNC. Curcumin has been reported
to activate p53 in many human carcinoma cells including
breast cancer, prostate cancer, and glioma cells (45–47). Interestingly, Sachdeva and colleagues showed that p53 directly
binds the promoter of miR145 at the p53 response element
region (48). p53 was shown to suppress EMT and TICs properties by upregulating miR145 (49). These data suggest a
possible mechanism that curcumin, by inducing the expression
of p53, could increase the expression of miR145 in HNC-TICs.
Future research delineates the details of how cucumin regulates its p53–miR145 axis, and how these interactions inﬂuence the stemness properties of TICs remains to be determined. Further research effort is needed in this area.
In conclusion, the present study showed that curcumin
inhibited HNC tumorigenicity through the miR145 or
miR145-SOX9/ADAM17 regulatory pathway, which resulted
in the inhibition of the self-renewal, tumor initiation, and
metastatic properties of HNC-TIC cells. miR145-mediated
inhibition of ADAM17 consequently disrupted the mainte-

nance of the cancer stem-like state of HNC-TICs through
repressing IL-6/sIL-6R trans-signaling. Therefore, elevating
miR145 expression by methods such as curcumin treatment
seems to be a promising therapeutic modality to target HNCTIC cells.
