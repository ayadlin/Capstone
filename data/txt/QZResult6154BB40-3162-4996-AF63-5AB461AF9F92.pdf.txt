BACKGROUND. Heparanase up-regulation has been correlated with reduced postoperative survival in various cancers.

METHODS. Heparanase expression was analyzed in 60 consenting tongue (mobile)
cancer patients by means of immunohistochemistry. Heparanase levels were also
analyzed in the saliva of both healthy controls and tongue cancer patients using
a novel heparanase enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method.

RESULTS. Heparanase staining was positive (>0) in 92% and negative (50) in 8%
of the tumors and staining intensity correlated with tumor size and tumor stage.

Moreover, the survival probability of patients negative for heparanase (50) at 60
months was 100%, compared with only 41% for patients positive for heparanase
(>0), suggesting that heparanase may serve as a prognostic factor for this malignancy and an attractive target for anticancer drug development. Heparanase was
detected in the saliva of healthy controls and the mean concentration was determined as 119  37 pg/mL. Importantly, a nearly 3-fold increase of heparanase
levels was detected in saliva collected from tongue cancer patients (334  69 pg/
mL), a difference that is statistically highly significant (P 5 .004).

CONCLUSIONS. These findings support heparanase up-regulation in tongue cancer
and raise the possibility of using this simple test as a diagnostic tool to monitor
tongue cancer progression and response to treatment. Cancer 2007;110:2732–9.

quamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the tongue is a common
malignancy of the oral cavity, with a 5-year mortality rate of
approximately 50%,1–3 a poor survival index that has not changed
significantly in the past half-century.4,5 Of those patients who do
survive, treatment frequently results in significant physical mutilation and compromised speech, taste, mastication, and swallowing.6
Improvement of patient survival requires a better understanding of
the biological nature of the disease and is expected to facilitate the
development of novel and more efficient treatment modalities for
this disease.7,8 Heparanase is an endoglycosidase that specifically
cleaves heparan sulfate (HS) sidechains of heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG),9–11 the major proteoglycan in the extracellular matrix (ECM) and the cell surface. The ECM provides an essential
physical barrier between cells and tissues and undergoes continuous
remodeling during certain pathologic conditions, such as cancer.12
ECM-remodeling enzymes are thus expected to affect cell and tissue
function profoundly. In addition, HS sidechains can bind a variety
of biological mediators such as growth factors, enzymes, cytokines,
and chemokines, thus forming a readily available reservoir that can
be liberated upon local or systemic cues, including heparanase

availability.13–16 Traditionally, heparanase activity has
been implicated in cellular invasion associated with
cancer metastasis.17–19 This notion recently gained
further support by employing siRNA and ribosome
technologies, clearly depicting heparanase-mediated
HS cleavage and ECM remodeling as critical requisites for angiogenesis and metastatic spread.20 More
recently, heparanase up-regulation was documented
in an increasing number of primary human tumors.
Heparanase induction correlated with reduced postoperative survival of pancreatic,21 bladder,22 gastric,23
cervical,24 salivary gland,25 nasopharyngeal,26 and
head and neck27 carcinomas. Similarly, heparanase
up-regulation correlated with increased lymph node
and distant metastasis,28–30 collectively providing
strong clinical support for the pro-metastatic feature
of the enzyme. Heparanase up-regulation has been
noted in oral cancer cell lines and tumor biopsies.31,32 However, careful analysis of heparanase
expression by a cohort of oral cancer biopsies has
not been reported so far. Here we examined heparanase expression in 60 tongue cancer patients by
means of immunochemistry. We provide evidence
that heparanase is overexpressed in 92% of the cases,
and that elevated levels of heparanase were also
detected in patient saliva. Heparanase up-regulation
correlated with tongue cancer progression (tumor
grade) and tumor size. Furthermore, heparanase
staining inversely correlated with cumulative survival
of tongue cancer patients, suggesting that the
enzyme plays an important role in this type of malignancy. A simple saliva test, therefore, may be applied
as a diagnostic tool to monitor tongue cancer
progression and, possibly, response to treatment.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Experimental Design
The study included 60 consenting patients (31 males
and 29 females aged 65  15 years) with tongue cancer who were diagnosed at the Department of Oral
and Maxillofacial Surgery, Rambam Health Care Center, Haifa, Israel, where archival paraffin-embedded
pathologic material was available for immunohistochemical analysis.33 Sixteen patients were diagnosed
with stage I disease, 22 patients with stage II disease,
and 9 and 12 patients were diagnosed with stage III
and stage IV disease, respectively. All patients had
their tumors resected within 1 to 2 weeks after diagnosis, followed by radiation therapy to the head and
neck region for patients at stages II-IV, with a mean
dose of 60 Gy. The study protocol was approved by
the Institutional Review Board. Clinical data included
demographics, site of tumor, TNM staging, treatment

modality, status at the end of the study (alive or
deceased), failure (local, regional, or distant), time to
failure, follow-up, and survival. Pathologic data
included histology, tumor grade, and local and regional spread of the disease (pT and pN).33

Heparanase Immunostaining
Staining of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded 5-lm
sections for heparanase was performed essentially as
described.25 Briefly, slides were deparaffinized, rehydrated, and endogenous peroxidase activity was
quenched (30 minutes) by 3% hydrogen peroxide in
methanol. Slides were then subjected to antigen retrieval by boiling (20 minutes) in 10 mM citrate
buffer, pH 6. Slides were incubated with 10% normal
goat serum (NGS) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)
for 60 minutes to block nonspecific binding and
incubated (20 hours, 48C) with anti-heparanase 733
antibody diluted 1:100 in blocking solution. Antibody
733 was raised in rabbits against a 15-amino acid
peptide (KKFKNSTYSRSSVDC) that maps at the Nterminus of the 50-kDa heparanase subunit and preferentially recognizes the 50-kDa heparanase subunit
versus the 65-kDa latent proenzyme.34 Slides were
extensively washed with PBS containing 0.01% Triton
X-100 and incubated with a secondary reagent (Envision kit) according to the manufacturer’s (Dako,
Glostrup, Denmark) instructions. After additional
washes the color was developed with the AEC reagent (Dako), sections were counterstained with
hematoxylin, and mounted as described.25 Immunostained specimens were examined by a senior pathologist (O.B.I.) who was blind to clinical data of
the patients and were scored according to the intensity of staining (0: none, 1: weak; 2: strong). Specimens that were similarly stained with preimmune
serum, or applying the above procedure but lacking
the primary antibody, yielded no detectable staining. In all tumors diagnosed as heparanase-positive,
>50% of the cells reacted with the anti-heparanase
antibody.
Saliva Collection and Analysis
In a separate study we examined heparanase concentration in saliva collected from 12 tongue cancer
patients (3 stage I, 4 stage II, 3 stage III, and 2 stage
IV) and 12 healthy donors, matched by age and sex,
by a novel enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
(ELISA) method.35 Whole saliva was collected shortly
before the administration of definitive therapy under
nonstimulatory conditions between 8 AM and noon,
at least 1 hour after food intake. Patients were asked
to generate saliva and to spit into a wide test tube
for 10 minutes. After collection the saliva was imme-

diately centrifuged (800g; 48C; 10 minutes) to remove
squamous cells and cell debris and heparanase levels
in the resulting supernatant were determined by
ELISA, essentially as described.35 Briefly, wells of
microtiter plates were coated (18 hours, 48C) with
2 lg/mL of 1E1 monoclonal anti-heparanase antibody
in 50 lL of coating buffer (0.05 M Na2CO3, 0.05 M
NaHCO3, pH 9.6) and were then blocked with 2% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 1 hour at 378C. Samples (200 lL) were loaded in duplicate and incubated
for 2 hours at room temperature, followed by the
addition of 100 lL antibody 1453 (1 lg/mL) for an
additional 2 hours at room temperature. Horseradish
peroxidase-conjugated goat antirabbit IgG (1:20,000)
in blocking buffer was added (1 hour, room temperature) and the reaction was visualized by the addition
of 50 lL chromogenic substrate for 30 minutes. The
reaction was stopped with 100 lL H2SO4 and absorbance at 450 nm was measured with reduction at 630
nm using an ELISA plate reader. Plates were washed
5 times with washing buffer (PBS, pH 7.4, containing
0.1% [v/v] Tween 20) after each step. As a reference
for quantification a standard curve was established
by a serial dilution of recombinant 8 1 50 GS3 active
heparanase enzyme (25–390 ng/mL).35

Statistical Analyses
For categorical variables the frequencies and percentages were calculated. Distributions for categorical
variables were compared and analyzed by the FisherIrwin exact test (small sample). For continuous variables, ranges, means, and standard deviations were
calculated. The results of continuous variables
between subgroups of patients were compared and
analyzed by 1-way analysis of variance (>2 subgroups) or by t-test (2 subgroups). The Kaplan-Meier
estimate was used to calculate the probability of survival rates as a function of time. The log-rank test
using Cox regression was used to compare between
the survival curves. Salivary median values were
computed and compared using the Wilcoxon rank
sum test. It is common practice to compute median
rather than mean values for salivary parameters due
to the well-known wide physiological variability of
salivary composition.

RESULTS
We have developed a polyclonal antibody (pAb #733)
that preferentially recognizes the 50-kDa heparanase
subunit over the latent 65-kDa proenzyme and utilized this antibody to study heparanase expression
by nasopharyngeal, head and neck, and salivary
gland tumor biopsies.25–27 We employed antibody

733 to examine heparanase expression in tumor
biopsies of tongue cancer patients. Of the 60 patients
analyzed, 5 (8%) stained negatively for heparanase
(0; Fig. 1A), whereas the other 55 (92%) stained positively. The heparanase-positive group was further
categorized according to the intensity of staining
(Fig. 1; Tables 1, 2). Thus, weak staining was found
in 82% (45 of 55) of positive specimens (11; Fig. 1B),
whereas 18% (10 of 55) were stained strongly (12;
Fig. 1C) for heparanase (Tables 1, 2). Adjacent, normal-looking tissue was not stained by the anti-heparanase antibody, thus serving as internal controls. The
epithelium that was present in the tissue adjacent to
the tumors, as well as that which was far away (often
being extended by more than 10 mm so that the
resection was in ‘safe margins’), was negative in all
tissue samples (Fig. 1). Heparanase immunostaining
was not significantly different between males and
females (P 5 .14) nor significantly altered by age
(P 5 .50).

Heparanase Expression Correlates With Tongue
Tumor Progression
Heparanase expression significantly correlated with
the stage of disease, as presented in Table 1
(P 5 .028). Thus, 100% of the negatively stained
tumors were early-stage cases (stages I-II), whereas
40% (22 of 55) of the heparanase-positive tumors
were advanced-stage cases (stages III-IV). Similar
results were found for the correlation between heparanase expression and the involvement of cervical
lymph node metastasis as 100% of the negatively
stained tumors were harvested from early-stage
patients who had no cervical metastasis (N0 necks),
whereas 36% of the heparanase-positive tumors were
advanced stage cases (P 5 .03). Also, similarly, heparanase expression correlated with tumor size (T)
(Table 2). Here, most cases (80%) negative for heparanase originated from small tumors (T1), whereas
73% to 80% of the heparanase-positive cases were
obtained from large tumors (T2-4, >2cm in diameter), differences that are statistically significant
(P 5 .05) (Table 2).
Analysis of Heparanase in Saliva
To further substantiate our immunohistochemistry
findings indicating induced heparanase expression
by tongue tumors, we determined heparanase levels
in patients’ saliva. We recently developed a sensitive
sandwich ELISA method suitable for determination
and quantification of heparanase in body fluids, and
demonstrated that urine heparanase levels are markedly elevated in leukemia and bladder carcinoma
patients.35 We therefore used the ELISA system and

determined heparanase levels in saliva collected
from healthy controls (n 5 12) and tongue cancer
patients (n 5 12). Most of the patients were with
advanced-stage disease (10 with stages III-IV and
only 2 with stages I-II). Heparanase was detected in
the saliva of healthy controls and the mean concentration was determined to be 119  37 pg/mL.
Importantly, a nearly 3-fold increase of heparanase
levels was detected in saliva collected from tongue
cancer patients (334  69 pg/mL), a difference that
is statistically highly significant (P 5 .004), thus supporting heparanase up-regulation in tongue cancer.

Prognostic Value of Heparanase for Tongue Carcinoma
To determine the prognostic value of heparanase for
tongue cancer, we analyzed the status of the patients,
cumulative survival, and cause-specific survival
according to heparanase expression levels. The intensity of heparanase staining inversely correlated with
the patient’s status (Table 1, Fig. 2A). Thus, all
patients negative for heparanase were still alive at 60
months, compared with 43% (95% confidence inter-

findings are obtained when the heparanase-negative
group is compared with the heparanase-positive
cases combined. Here, all the heparanase-negative
patients were still alive at 60 months, compared with
only 41% (95% CI, 26%–55%) of the heparanasepositive cases, differences that are statistically highly
significant (P 5 .02) (Fig. 2B).

Heparanase Staining in Correlation With Survival and
Proliferation Mediators
We previously used this cohort of tumor biopsies and
examined the expression of several molecules implicated in tongue cancer progression by means of
immunochemistry.33 Therefore, we took advantage of

this prior information and analyzed a possible crosstalk between heparanase and 1 of these molecules.
There was a trend toward a correlation between
heparanase and Bcl-2, a known antiapoptotic molecule. Thus, 4 out of 5 tumor specimens that were
negative for heparanase were also negative for Bcl-2
expression, whereas 7 out of 45 specimens (15%)
positive for heparanase were also positive for Bcl-2
staining, yet the analysis yielded only borderline statistical significance (P 5 .11).
Nevertheless, heparanase staining correlated
with the expression of Skp-2 and p27. Thus, the
mean Skp-2 staining level of the heparanase-positive
specimens was 15.5%, compared with only 6.5% of
the heparanase-negative group, differences that are
statistically significant (P 5 .05) (Table 3). An inverse
correlation was found between heparanase and p27.
p27 staining by the heparanase-negative specimens
was 47% compared with only 33% of the heparanase-positive cases, differences that are statistically
highly significant (P 5 .028) (Table 4). These relations
between the expression of heparanase, Skp-2, p27,
and Bcl-2 were independent of the tumor stage.

DISCUSSION
Heparanase up-regulation has been noted in essentially all primary human tumors examined.36,37 Similarly, heparanase induction was also noted in most
biopsies of tongue cancer (Fig. 1; Table 1), correlating
with tumors larger in size (Table 1) and in progression (Table 2). This is in agreement with previous
findings correlating heparanase levels with larger hepatocellular,38 gastric,23 and breast39 carcinomas. We
further employed a novel ELISA method and determined heparanase levels in saliva collected from
both healthy controls and tongue cancer patients.
The results clearly revealed a 3-fold increase of
heparanase levels in cancer patient saliva. These
findings not only confirm the induction of heparanase expression noted by immunohistochemistry, but
also suggest that heparanase can be monitored by a
simple diagnostic test of saliva and, possibly, predict
tongue tumor progression and response to treatment.
Such a diagnostic tool is of special importance given
the inverse correlation found between heparanase
expression and patient survival (Figs. 1, 2). Reduced
postoperative survival of cancer patients overexpressing heparanase has been noted in colorectal, pancreatic, bladder, gastric, and cervical carcinomas,36
and is most likely due to increased tumor metastasis,
a feature traditionally attributed to heparanase activity.36 The role that heparanase plays in the primary
lesion, facilitating tumor progression, is less understood. Accumulating evidence strongly suggests that
heparanase functions as a proangiogenic mediator.40–43
This function is mediated by the release of HS-bound
angiogenic growth factors such as bFGF40,43 and
induction of VEGF gene transcription.44 Interestingly,
VEGF induction by heparanase was noted to be
mediated by Src activation and was independent of
heparanase enzymatic activity. Nonenzymatic functions of heparanase also include enhanced adhesion
of primary endothelial and T cells42 and tumorderived cells,41 induction of tissue factor expression,45 and activation of the prosurvival mediator
Akt.42 Thus, it is likely that heparanase facilitates tumor vascularity, coagulation complications, and cell
survival. Correlations found in the current study support this notion and suggest that heparanase is also
involved in cell proliferation. Bcl-2 is an important
antiapoptotic protein, the expression of which is
regulated by the p53 tumor suppressor gene. It has
been shown that mutated p53, the most commonly
known genetic alteration in human cancer, up-regulates Bcl-2 expression, whereas wildtype p53 contributes to tumor suppression through cell cycle arrest
and induction of apoptosis.46,47 The observed correlation between heparanase and Bcl-2 expression,

2737

although borderline in significance for tongue cancer,
supports the notion that heparanase functions as a
prosurvival factor for tumor cells, a function that
may prove significant for other types of human cancer. Studies examining this possibility are currently
in progress. p27, an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases, is a cell cycle inhibitor and a negative cell
cycle regulator that plays an important role in tumor
suppression and, indeed, down-regulation of p27
correlates with poor prognosis.48,49 Overexpression of
the ubiquitin ligase Skp2 is observed in aggressive
carcinomas and is responsible for down-regulation of
p27 levels. Thus, p27 and Skp2 inversely correlate
with each other, as was also noted in tongue cancer.33 Interestingly, heparanase staining correlated
with Skp2 expression (Table 3), and inversely correlated with p27 levels (Table 4). These findings suggest that heparanase not only promotes cancer cell
survival but also uses the p27-Skp2 axis to facilitate
cell proliferation and tumor progression. These relations among the expression rates of heparanase, Skp2, p27, and Bcl-2 were found to be independent of
the tumor stage, a result that further emphasizes the
significance of these biological pathways as related
to the carcinogenesis process of tongue cancer.
Taken together, our results indicate that heparanase expression is enhanced in tongue tumors, and
that the outcome of these patients inversely correlates with heparanase levels. The results further
reveal a correlation between heparanase levels and
tongue tumor progression and size, and suggest a
novel link between heparanase and the p27-Skp2
axis, likely tilting the balance toward cell proliferation. Higher levels of heparanase in cancer patients’
saliva raises the possibility of using this simple test
as a diagnostic tool to monitor tongue cancer progression and response to treatment, and to further
encourage the development of heparanase inhibitors
for the treatment of this lethal cancer. Furthermore,
to make the proposal of using heparanase as a
screening tool stronger, we intend to conduct a
future study where we stain the lymph node metastasis of the patients with heparanase-specific antibody, which will provide additional information on
the link between heparanase and metastatic disease.
