ABSTRACT
Galectin-3 (Gal-3, LGALS3) is a pleotropic versatile, 29–35 kDa chimeric
gene product, and involved in diverse physiological and pathological processes,
including cell growth, homeostasis, apoptosis, pre-mRNA splicing, cell-cell and cellmatrix adhesion, cellular polarity, motility, adhesion, activation, differentiation,
transformation, signaling, regulation of innate/adaptive immunity, and angiogenesis.
In multiple diseases, it was found that the level of circulating Gal-3 is markedly
elevated, suggesting that Gal-3-dependent function is mediated by specific interaction
with yet an unknown ubiquitous cell-surface protein. Recently, we showed that Gal-3
attenuated drug-induced apoptosis, which is one of the mechanisms underlying
multidrug resistance (MDR). Here, we document that MDR could be mediated by
Gal-3 interaction with the house-keeping gene product e.g., Na+/K+-ATPase,
and P-glycoprotein (P-gp). Gal-3 interacts with Na+/K+-ATPase and induces the
phosphorylation of P-gp. We also find that Gal-3 binds P-gp and enhances its ATPase
activity. Furthermore Gal-3 antagonist suppresses this interaction and results in
a decrease of the phosphorylation and the ATPase activity of P-gp, leading to an
increased sensitivity to doxorubicin-mediated cell death. Taken together, these
findings may explain the reported roles of Gal-3 in diverse diseases and suggest that
a combined therapy of inhibitors of Na+/K+-ATPase and Gal-3, and a disease specific
drug(s) might be superior to a single therapeutic modality.

It was reported that the level of circulating Gal-3 is
significantly elevated in the serum of patients with various
cancers [9–10, 11]. In addition, Gal-3 was found to be a
potent pro-inflammatory protein and increased levels of
serum Gal-3 were reported in immune and metabolic
diseases, fibrosis, cirrhosis and heart diseases to name
but few [3, 12, 13]. Gal-3 is lacking a leader sequence
for secretion and is secreted into the extracellular milieu
via non-classical pathways [7]. The interaction of Gal-3
with carbohydrate-conjugates of cell surface proteins
and components of the extracellular matrix (ECM) such
as MUC1, CD98, laminin and fibronectin, results in
tumor cell migration, invasion and metastasis [14–16].

INTRODUCTION
Galectins are a family of mammalian beta-galactoside
binding proteins that share a highly conserved carbohydrate
recognition domain (CRD) of which 15 galectin members
have been identified to date [1, 2]. Galectin-3 (Gal-3) is
the only member of the chimera-type galectin subgroup
and contains a single CRD. There is both direct and
circumstantial evidence that Gal-3 plays a significant role
in cell growth, homeostasis, apoptosis, pre-mRNA splicing,
adhesion, activation, differentiation, transformation,
signaling, angiogenesis, inflammation, fibrosis, cancer
progression, and metastasis [3–8].

The binding of Gal-3 to alpha-v-beta-3 integrins and
vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor 2
on endothelial cells contributes to its pro-angiogenesis
effect [16, 17]. Furthermore, extracellular soluble Gal-3
induces apoptosis of immune cells through the interaction
with CD29 and CD7 [18]. Although multiple effects of
circulating Gal-3 via the carbohydrate binding motif
has been reported, it should be noted that Gal-3 directly
interacts with proteins lacking carbohydrates, such as
beta-catenin [19], Nup98 [20], Ras [21], U1 snRNP [22],
Notch [23] and Bcl-2 family proteins [24, 25].
Multidrug resistance (MDR) phenotype is a major
obstacle in successful chemotherapy. Cancer cells exhibit
intrinsic or acquired MDR during tumor progression and/or
drug therapy [26], and may develop a cross-drug-resistance
to unexposed and structurally unrelated chemotherapeutic
agents [27]. Several mechanisms underlying MDR were
reported including decreased drug influx, increased drug
efflux, altered cell cycle checkpoints, altered drug targets,
increased drug metabolism and/or resistance to druginduced apoptosis [26, 28]. Of these mechanisms, drug
efflux is the most commonly encountered and mediated
by ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, such as
the P-glycoprotein (P-gp/Mdr-1) [27]. Previously, we
have reported that intracellular Gal-3 induced by drug
treatment attenuates drug-induced apoptosis, a mechanism
underlying MDR [25]. Others have reported that several
secreted proteins like VEGF or SFRP contribute to the
acquisition of MDR [29, 30], suggesting a possible role
of secreted Gal-3 for MDR processes in cancer. Although
several methods have been developed for targeting P-gp
to avoid MDR, they only displayed limited success due to
excessive systemic side effects [26].
In the present study, we embarked on a
broad proteomic study to identify a cell surface
binding-partner(s) of Gal-3, and found Na+/K+-ATPase.
Furthermore we report extracellular Gal-3 enhances MDR
phenotype through Na+/K+-ATPase and P-gp. The results
reported here provide a new insight into the function of
circulating Gal-3 in MDR processes.

Preparation of recombinant Gal-3-V5
(rGal-3-V5)

Co-immunoprecipitation assay

The recombinant Gal-3 was constructed in the
plasmid pET-22b (+) and expressed in E.coli BL21 (DE3)
through inducement by IPTG. The protein was purified
using lactosyl sepharose CL 4B column. Then, the protein
was analyzed with Gelcode blue staining, concentrated in a
buffer containing 20 mM Tris pH 7.9, 25% glycerol, 10 mM
dithiothreitol (DTT), and 2 mM EDTA and stored at −80°C
[31]. The concentration was measured by BCA protein assay.

Cells were lysed in previously described buffer
containing 1% CHAPS and protease inhibitors. After
BCA protein assay, cell lysates containing equal amount
of proteins were incubated with appropriate antibodies
overnight and 15 microliters of protein G Sepharose
(GE Healthcare) for 1 h at 4°C. The beads were washed
three times and boiled in 2x sample buffer. Supernatant was
subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted for appropriate
antibodies. Each experiment was repeated at least, twice.

Proteomics analysis

siRNA transfection

Purified rGal-3-V5 was incubated with
DTSSP cross linker in HeLa cells. Cells were lysed
in buffer containing 1% 3-(3-cholamidopropyl)
diethyl-ammonio-1- propanesulfonate (CHAPS) and
protease inhibitors. Gal-3-V5-conjugated cell lysates were
immunoprecipitated with anti-V5 antibody plus 15 alphal
of protein G Sepharose (GE Healthcare, Pittsburgh,
PA) overnight. After extensive washing, suspension in
SDS sample buffer, and heat denaturing, the peptides
were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE. Gel slices were
transferred to The Wayne State University Proteomics
Core Facility (The Wayne State University Proteomics
Core Facility, job #1462). The peptides were separated
by reverse phase chromatography (Acclaim PepMap100
C18 column), followed by ionization with the Nanospray
Flex Ion Source, and introduced into a Q Exactive mass
spectrometer (Thermo scientific). Data analysis was
performed using Proteome Discoverer 1.4 (Thermo
scientific) which incorporated the Mascot algorithm
(Matrix Science, Boston, MA). The SwissProt_2013_04
database was used against human protein sequences and
a reverse decoy protein database was run simultaneously
for false discovery rate (FDR) determination. Secondary
analysis was performed using Scaffold (Proteome
Software, Portland, OR). Minimum protein identification
probability was set as > = 99% with 2 unique peptides at
> = 99% minimum peptide identification probability.

siRNA against Na+/K+-ATPase alpha(sc-43956)
and Mdr-1 (sc-29395), and control siRNA (sc-37007)

cells using Lipofectamine RNAiMax reagent (Invitrogen)
according to the manufacturer’s instruction. Cell viability
after transfection was determined by the MIT assay, see
above, and both the control and the experimental assays
were found to yield > 95% cell viability.

Preparation of GCS-100/modified citrus
pectin (MCP)
Citrus Pectin (CP) was purchased from Sigma
Chemicals. Temperature modification of CP was performed
as follows: CP solution (1.3%) was autoclaved for 1 h;
cooled to room temperature, centrifuged at 10,  000  g
for 10 min. collected supernatant was precipitated with
2 volumes of absolute ethanol and frozen at −20°C for
2 h. After centrifuging at 10, 000 g for 10 min again, the
supernatant was discarded and pellet was saved. The pellet
was suspended in acetone, filtered, and dried on Whatman
filters. MCP was dissolved in de-ionized distilled water.

P-gp ATPase activity assay
The P-gp-GloTM Assay Systems (Promega, Madison,
WI) was used to perform P-gp ATPase activity assay.
A P-gp ATPase assay detects the effect of compounds on
recombinant human P-gp in the cell membrane fraction.
Briefly, ATP was first incubated with P-gp membranes and
MgATP, then the P-gp ATPase reaction was stopped, and
the remaining ATP was detected as a luciferase-generated
luminescent signal. Basal P-gp ATPase activities were
investigated by detecting activity in the presence or
absence of sodium orthovanadate. The P-gp-GloTM Assay
Systems (Promega, Madison, WI) was used, as described
[32] to perform not total ATPase but P-gp ATPase activity
assay with recombinant P-gp. This commercial assay kit
includes Verapamil as a positive control for P-gp activity.

Immunofluorescence
Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS
for 15 min, permeabilized with 1% Saponin for 10 min,
blocked with 1% BSA in PBS for 30 min and incubated
with indicated antibodies for overnight, then incubated
with tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate (TRITC)conjugated antibody and fluorescein isothiocyanate
(FITC)-conjugated antibody (Sigma-Aldrich) for 1 h in
the dark. Nuclei were stained with 1 microgram/ml of 4′,
6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) for 3 min. Pictures

we investigated cell viability with DXR treatment in
the presence or absence of 0.5 micromolar exogenous
recombinant Gal-3-V5 (rGal-3-V5) protein. As shown in
Figure 1B, cells treated with rGal-3-V5 showed increased
viability against DXR treatment. Next, to identify a cell
surface molecule(s) interacting with Gal-3, we performed
a broad proteomic study using mass spectrum following
the co-immunoprecipitation with purified rGal-3-V5. As a
result, 350 proteins were nominated from the analysis and
Na+/K+-ATPase alpha1 subunit (NCB Accession # P05023)
was found to be the most specific and therefore selected
as a candidate protein for further studies to identify if it is
responsible for exogenous Gal-3-induced drug resistance
(Figure 1C). Of note, others have reported that alterations
in the homeostasis of Na+ and K+ ions cause change of
cell volume and lead to apoptosis [28]. Furthermore, in
drug-induced apoptotic processes, Na+/K+-ATPase may act
as an anti-apoptotic transporter [34]. Thus, we examined
the expression pattern of Na+/K+-ATPase in several cancer
cells (Figure 2A). To further confirm Gal-3-Na+/K+ATPase interaction, we performed co-immunoprecipitation
assays using total cell lysates from cells treated with
rGal-3-V5. As predicted, the endogenous Na+/K+-ATPase
was co-precipitated with Gal-3-V5 regardless of cancer
cell type, and the reciprocal experiments revealed that Gal3-V5 was co-immunoprecipitated with Na+/K+-ATPase
(Figure 2B). In addition, confocal immunofluorescent
microscopic visualization depicted a co-localization
of Gal-3-V5 and Na+/K+-ATPase on the cell surface
(Figure 2C). To further delineate whether the interaction
is dependent on the sugar-binding properties of Gal-3,

RESULTS
Doxorubicin (DXR) induces Gal-3 secretion and
extracellular Gal-3 interacts with Na+/K+-ATPase
Gal-3 overexpression in cancer cells leads to its
higher secretion and concentration in the circulation of
patients [7, 8, 33]. Our previous report indicated that
patients with metastases arising from prostate cancer
have a higher serum galectin-3 concentration [12]. In
addition, we recently showed that the anti-apoptotic
function of intracellular Gal-3 in which its expression
increased with cis-diammineplatinum dichloride (CDDP)
and DXR treatment [25]. Thus, we questioned whether
extracellular Gal-3 also contributes to the protection
of cancer cells against anti-cancer drug. Initially, we
examined its expression level after DXR treatment. As
expected, we detected an increase of expression and
secretion of Gal-3 in cells treated with DXR (Figure 1A).
To address the role of extracellular Gal-3 on cell survival,

relative intensity of Na+/K+-ATPase alpha1 normalized to V5. The value of cells treated with rGal-3-V5 alone was set as 1.

we added lactose, a Gal-3 sugar antagonist [18], to cells
and found that the interaction of Gal-3-V5 with Na+/K+ATPase in cells treated with lactose was significantly
reduced as compared with control (Figure 2D). These
data indicate that Gal-3-Na+/K+-ATPase recognition and
binding is through the CRD of Gal-3.

in Na+/K+-ATPase and is able to be activated by the
ligand of Na+/K+-ATPase [34, 37], we examined whether
the interaction of Gal-3 with Na+/K+-ATPase was also
associated with the activation of Src kinase. We have
tested human fibrosarcoma cells HT1080 since they
secret very low level of endogenous Gal-3 (Figure 3A).
The incubation with rGal-3-V5 significantly increased
the phosphorylation of Src and Akt, with no significant
change of ERK phosphorylation (Figure 3B). This
phosphorylation of Src was suppressed by a clinically
tested Gal-3 antagonist e.g.,  modified citrus pectin
(MCP) [25, 38,  39] (Figure 3C). To address whether
Gal-3-induced Src phosphorylation was mediated
by Na+/K+-ATPase, we treated the cells with siRNA
of Na+/K+-ATPase and found that Gal-3-induced Src
phosphorylation was suppressed in Na+/K+-ATPase
knockdown cells (Figure 3D). Finally, we questioned
whether Gal-3 affects the interaction of Na+/K+-ATPase

Gal-3 activates Src kinase through the
interaction with Na+/K+-ATPase
Next we explored the molecular outcomes of
the interaction of Gal-3 with Na+/K+-ATPase. Apart
from ion homeostasis, Na+/K+-ATPase was reported to
interact with Src, membrane-associated non-receptor
tyrosine kinases, and form a functional signal complex
[34]. Na+/K+-ATPase relays the extracellular signal to
intracellular compartments via cascades of EGFR-SrcERK [36]. In this mechanism, as Src kinase is trapped

and Src. It was found that Na+/K+-ATPase was
co-precipitated with Src after incubation with rGal-3-V5
and MCP suppressed this interaction (Figure 3E). These
data indicate that Gal-3 activates Src and induces
Src-Na+/K+-ATPase interaction. To address whether Gal3-induced cell survival is mediated by Na+/K+-ATPase,
we have tested the effects of both MCP and ouabain,
an inhibitor of Na+/K+-ATPase, on DXR-treated cells.
As shown in Figure 4A, exogenous Gal-3 partially
recovered the cell viability of DXR-treated cells and
this resistance was reduced by ouabain, suggesting that
Na+/K+-ATPase is a downstream effector of Gal-3, as
concluded from the fact that MCP and/or ouabain affect
DXR-mediated cell death (Figure 4B).

Since P-gp is a molecular pump protecting cells from
toxic molecules [26], we examined P-gp expression in PC3
cells treated with DXR. Although we did not observe any
change in the level of P-gp expression, its phosphorylation
was induced in response to DXR treatment, suggesting
that Gal-3 affects P-gp phosphorylation (Figure 5A). Next
we determined the phosphorylation status of P-gp with the
incubation of rGal-3-V5 at the indicated concentrations
and exogenous Gal-3 induced P-gp phosphorylation
in a concentration-dependent manner (Figure 5B).
Furthermore, we examined the possible suppression effect

P-gp phosphorylation induced by Gal-3 (Figure 5C).
Taking into account that Gal-3 activates Src kinase
through Na+/K+-ATPase (Figure 3), we utilized PP2, a Src
kinase inhibitor to determine the effect of Src kinase on
P-gp phosphorylation (Figure 5D). Indeed, PP2 suppressed
the induction of P-gp phosphorylation with rGal-3-V5
treatment, indicating that Gal-3 induces phosphorylation
of P-gp via Na+/K+-ATPase and Src kinase. Moreover, in
PC3 cells treated with DXR, the P-gp phosphorylation
level was increased. This induction was suppressed by
MCP or inhibition of Na+/K+-ATPase, suggesting the effect
of endogenous secreted Gal-3 (Figure 5E).

partially recovered the cell viability in DXR-treated cells

involved in cell resistance to cytotoxic drug through
activation of P-gp.

DISCUSSION
Here, we report that extracellular Gal-3 contributes
to the acquisition of MDR through interaction with
Na+/K+-ATPase and P-gp in cancer cells. Circulating
Gal-3 serves as a biomarker for monitoring recurrence/
metastasis in several cancers [9–11] and the role of Gal-3
on MDR was revealed in this cell-based study. Therefore,
the consideration of targeting extracellular Gal-3 may
take advantage of an improved therapeutic modality due
to inactivation of P-gp and circumvention of MDR.
Na+/K+-ATPase is composed of three subunits,
regulates the translocation of Na+ and K+ across the
cell membrane and acts as a signal transducer [40]. The
expression of major isoform of Na+/K+-ATPase, subunit
alpha1 is ubiquitously detected in various tissues of all
higher eukaryotes [41]. Inhibition of Na+/K+-ATPase has
been widely used for the treatment of heart failure. Also,
it was a reduction of cancer incidence in cardiac patients
taking digoxin, was observed together with experimental
and epidemiological studies have consolidated the
anti-cancer potential of Na+/K+ ATPase inhibitors
(for review see 42). More importantly, a new series of
pharmacologically optimized Na+/K+-ATPase inhibitors
have recently shown strong anti-cancer activities and
reached early clinical trials [42–44]. Further it was
documented and proposed that Na (+)/K (+)-ATPase is

Gal-3 confers cell resistance to DXR through
activation of P-gp
To determine whether Gal-3 affects P-gp activity,
drug-stimulated P-gp ATPase activity assay was
performed. The function of P-gp is connected to ATP
hydrolysis by the ATPase, and its activity is influenced by
P-gp substrates or modulators. As shown in Figure 6A, the
incubation of Gal-3 with P-gp enhanced the P-gp ATPase
activity stimulated by DXR (lane 3 and 6), while addition
of MCP suppressed the enhancement of ATPase activity
(lane 7), indicating that Gal-3 directly affects the ATPase
activity of P-gp. Thus, we expected that Gal-3 bound P-gp
and performed co-immunoprecipitation assay. As shown
in Figure 6B, Gal-3-V5 was co-precipitated with P-gp
(Upper Panel), the reciprocal experiments revealed that
P-gp was co-immunoprecipitated with Gal-3-V5 (Middle
Panel) and this interaction was depend on CRD of Gal-3.
Intriguingly, we also noted a co-precipitation of Na+/K+ATPase with P-gp (Upper Panel). Finally, we examined

a valuable target in anticancer therapy and its inhibitors
and ligands could be designed as potential anticancer
agents. Of note, a recent review [45] has noted that
clinical trials with Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase as a single agent
or in combination with other anticancer were safe but
showed limited efficacy in cancer patients Thus, it was
recommended that well-designed randomized clinical
trials s are needed to confirm the efficacy and safety of
cardiac glycosides for the treatment of cancer. We found
that Gal-3 bound a novel binding partner, Na+/K+-ATPase.

The finding that Na+/K+-ATPase interacts with circulating
Gal-3 is further supported by earlier reports, showing
that Na+/K+-ATPase reacts with beta-galactoside soybean
agglutinin, peanut agglutinin [46] and cholera toxin
(CT) [47]. Of note, there are several functional similarities
between Gal-3 and Na+/K+-ATPase, including apoptosis
[24, 45], inflammation [6, 49], ERK signaling [31, 50],
membrane recycling [51, 52] and anoikis [53, 54] and
both are associated with the scavenger receptor CD36
[52, 55]. Since serum Gal-3 is an emerging biomarker for

cancers and other inflammation-related diseases [6–8, 32].
Of note, recently published report that has concluded
that “the formation of Na/K-ATPase-Src complex might
enable a dynamic on/off mechanism of Src regulation,
and that the α1 Na/K-ATPase may be a key player in
dynamic regulation of cellular Src activity [55]. Further,
it was shown that cells contain a pool of Src-interacting

new insight to understand the pathophysiology of multiple
Gal-3-overexpressing diseases such as immune diseases,
metabolic diseases and fibrosis as well as cancer. It
should also be noted that the existence of Na/K ATPase
‘signalosome’ was implicated to be interacts with major
components of gliomagenesis: EGFR, caveolin-1, PI3K,
Src, and Ras. On ouabain binding, the NaK α1 subunit
in caveolae associates with several proteins, such as
caveolin- 1[57]. In addition a Gal-3-Src interaction was
reported as well [58, 59]. The above and the present
findings thus, give credence to the further need to
determine the functional relationship between Gal-3 and
Na+/K+-ATPase and their inhibitors in the clinical setting.
P-gp binds hydrophobic molecules in the cell
membrane, and then undergoes a conformational
alteration. The new conformation opens toward the outside
of the cell, and the molecule is ejected utilizing ATP as
the driving force [26]. P-gp is known to be regulated by
post-translational modification as well as transcription. It
has serine phosphorylation residues in the linker region
between the two homologous halves, mediated by protein
kinase A (PKA) and protein kinase C (PKC) [60]. Na/k
ATPase was shown to be associated with the rug resistance
phenotype [61], and a down-regulation of Na+/K+-ATPase
in multidrug-resistant, P-glycoprotein-overexpressing cells
was observed [62]. The downstream signaling pathways
were deregulated in the Na+/K+-ATPase ‘signalosome’
and to play a role be in the multidrug-resistant phenotype
[63]. It was also shown that anti-Na/K ATPase stimulates
the expression of the MDR-1 (multidrug resistance) gene
and the synthesis of an active P-glycoprotein (P-gp) in
some human epithelial cells, these data, which emphasize
the complex mechanism of action of ouabain, suggest that
changes in intracellular ionic activities modulate CFTR/
MDR-1 gene expressions [54]. It was also suggested
that Glioblastoma patients who do not respond to
chemotherapy and whose tumors over-express NaK alpha1
subunits could benefit from a treatment using ligands with
marked binding affinity for the NaK alpha1 subunit [57].
P-gp phosphorylation has been reported to be
essential for its function [64], while controversy exists as
other reports have suggested its phosphorylation has no
effect on the function of P-gp [65]. Although we identified
a tyrosine kinase, Src-mediated serine phosphorylation
of P-gp in Gal-3-treated cells, further studies including
the identification of specific phosphorylation sites
and the involved serine kinases, are needed to establish
the functional relationship between activity and
phosphorylation of P-gp.
Based on the above data, we propose the following
model for the mechanisms by which extracellular Gal-3
involves in MDR depicted in Figure 6D: (i) Gal-3 activates
Src kinase through the interaction with Na+/K+-ATPase,
subsequently leading to the induction of phosphorylation
of P-gp; (ii) Gal-3 also binds P-gp and induces the
ATPase activity of P-gp. However, the question includes
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

whether these mechanisms are independent or Gal-3/Na+/
K+-ATPase/P-gp cooperate in acquiring MDR phenotype.
Recently, targeting Na+/K+-ATPase was reported to allow
circumvention of various chemo resistance pathways [65],
all of which point to a correlation between Na+/K+-ATPase
and P-gp in the expression of MDR phenotype.
Most clinical trials targeting P-gp fail due to toxic side
effects and pharmacokinetic interactions that limited drug
clearance and metabolism of chemotherapy [26]. Although
it is generally accepted that cancer cells can convert to
become multidrug resistant, normal human tissues remain
sensitive to the toxic effects of chemotherapy, suggesting
that multidrug-resistance gene products might be useful
for protection of normal tissues against the cytotoxic side
effects of anti-cancer drug [27]. Accordingly, targeting
selectively circulating Gal-3 in cancer using its antagonist
may provide a new therapeutic paradigm for circumvention
of MDR without side effects obtained from direct
inhibition  of P-gp. A combined therapy of inhibitors of
Na+/K+-ATPase and Gal-3, and a disease specific drug(s)
may be superior to a single therapeutic modality.
