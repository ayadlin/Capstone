Summary
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Several aspects common to a Western lifestyle, including obesity and decreased physical activity,
are known risks for gastrointestinal cancers1. There is substantial evidence suggesting that diet
profoundly affects the composition of the intestinal microbiota2. Moreover, there is now
unequivocal evidence linking dysbiosis to cancer development3. Yet the mechanisms through
which high-fat diet (HFD)-mediated changes in the microbial community impact the severity of
tumorigenesis in the gut remain to be determined.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Here we demonstrate that HFD promotes tumor progression in the small intestine of genetically
susceptible K-rasG12Dint mice independently of obesity. HFD consumption in conjunction with KRas mutation mediates a shift in the composition of gut microbiota, which is associated with a
decrease in Paneth cell antimicrobial host defense that compromises dendritic cell (DC)
recruitment and MHC-II presentation in the gut-associated lymphoid tissues (GALTs). DC
recruitment in GALTs can be normalized, and tumor progression attenuated, when K-rasG12Dint
mice are supplemented with butyrate. Importantly, Myd88-deficiency blocks tumor progression.
Transfer of fecal samples from diseased donors into healthy adult K-rasG12Dint mice is sufficient
to transmit disease in the absence of HFD. Furthermore, treatment with antibiotics completely
blocks HFD-induced tumor progression suggesting a pivotal role for distinct microbial shifts in
aggravating disease. Collectively, these data underscore the importance of the reciprocal
interaction between host and environmental factors in selecting microbiota that favor
carcinogenesis, and suggest tumorigenesis may be transmissible among genetically predisposed
individuals.
Undoubtedly various factors contribute to the etiology of intestinal cancer, but there are
compelling arguments to include high fat diet (HFD) and composition of gut microbiota as
key risk factors4. Given the dramatic increase in the incidence of diet-induced obesity
worldwide5 and the recent evidence for a more efficient nutrient-harvesting microbiota in
obese individuals6,7, understanding the role of gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of cancer
is crucial.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We set out to elucidate whether alterations in gut microbial community may represent a
potential link between HFD and pathogenesis of intestinal cancer. To that end we used a
well-characterized serrated hyperplasia model with oncogenic K-Ras expression in the
intestinal epithelium, K-rasG12Dint mice8, and exposed them to an HFD regimen for 22
weeks (Fig. 1a). While 33% of age-matched mice on a normal diet (ND) developed only
murine serrated hyperplasia (mSH) along the intestine, HFD consumption led to enhanced
tumor progression in 60% of K-rasG12Dint mice (Fig. 1b). These mice developed tumors in
the duodenum that ranged from murine serrated adenoma, with low-grade (mSA-LGD) and
high-grade (mSA-HGD) dysplasia, to invasive carcinoma, closely recapitulating the
carcinogenic sequence in humans (Fig. 1c). These cells metastasized to liver, pancreas and
spleen when mice were kept over 40 weeks on HFD (Extended Data Fig. 1a). Serrated
tumors revealed increased proliferation on the tips of the villi that was otherwise restricted
to the crypt region (Extended Data Fig. 1b). Importantly, diet-induced obesity was
compromised in K-rasG12Dint mice during disease progression (Extended Data Fig. 1c). In
accordance with increased insulin sensitivity observed in these animals, lipid accumulation

in liver was decreased (Extended Data Fig. 1d and e). Taken together these data suggest
diet-mediated effects on the host were responsible for promoting serrated-tumor progression
in the small intestine.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

HFD induces a low-grade inflammatory state9 and inflammation is a hallmark of cancer10.
Unexpectedly, TNF-α, as well as macrophage surface marker F4/80, were down-regulated
in the duodenum of K-rasG12Dint mice (Extended Data Fig. 1f). Moreover, K-rasG12Dint
animals exhibited a significant reduction in the expression of genes involved in recognition
and immune response to antigens suggesting oncogene-driven down-modulation of host
immunity (Fig. 1d and Extended Data Fig. 2a). This was indeed associated with decreased
Paneth cell antimicrobial defense and altered differentiation markers in the small intestine
(Extended Data Fig. 2b and 2c). Upon exposure to bacteria or their antigens, Paneth cells
secrete defensins (cryptdins) with anti-bacterial function during immunity and shape the
composition of the microbiota11. This activity was significantly decreased in K-rasG12Dint
mice regardless of the tumor incidence. Intestinal epithelium is covered by a mucous layer,
largely composed of mucins, providing a physical barrier to limit damage to the epithelium
and to enhance gut homeostasis by delivering tolerogenic signals12. Indeed muc2 expression
was significantly decreased after HFD (Extended Data Fig. 2c). In agreement with the gene
expression data, MHC class II expression in CD11c+ and CD11b+ cell populations in the
lamina propria (LP) (Fig. 1e) as well as in Peyer’s patches (PP) was significantly reduced in
K-rasG12Dint mice (Extended Data Fig. 2d). Taken together these data suggest diminished
cryptdin expression in Paneth cells due to oncogene activation in combination with altered
mucin profiles caused by HFD could render K-rasG12Dint mice susceptible to dampened
immunity.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

HFD may employ dramatic changes in secretory, absorptive, and immune function of the gut
through regulating microbial communities13. To define whether HFD-induced alterations in
microbiota were associated with increased tumor incidence, amplicons generated from small
intestinal and colonic fecal DNA were subjected to 16S rRNA gene sequencing. HFD
altered community diversity in the intestine in comparison to ND. Helicobacteraceae,
Lactobacillaceae, Enterobacteriaceae, Clostridiaceae, Peptostreptococcaceae were
significantly elevated, whereas Bifidobacteriaceae, Porphyromonadaceae, and
Alcaligenaceae were significantly decreased in the small intestine of K-rasG12Dint mice
following HFD (Fig. 2a). Moreover, although no tumors were detected in the colon,
Enterobacteriaceae, Desulfovibrionaceae, Porhyromonadaceae, Rikenellaceae,
Ruminococcaceae, Lachnospiraceae, Coriobacteriaceae, and Deferribacteraceae were
significantly increased in colonic tissue of K-rasG12Dint mice, whereas Bifidobacteriaceae,
Peptostreptococcaceae, Roseburia, and Butyricicoccus were decreased after HFD (Fig. 2b).
Indeed HFD initiated a major structural change of the gut microbiota in tumor bearing KrasG12Dint mice (Fig. 2 and Extended Data Fig. 3a-c).
Bacteria are sensed through pattern recognition receptors (PRR), Toll-like receptors (TLRs),
and the downstream adapter protein Myd8814. Interestingly, general ablation of Myd88
conferred complete protection against tumor progression, suggesting a causal role for
intestinal microbiota in the tumorigenic process (Extended Data Fig. 4a). To distinguish
which Myd88–deficient cell type conferred protection against tumorigenesis, K-rasG12Dint

mice were either crossed to Myd88fl/fl animals or transplanted with wild type (WT) or
Myd88-deficient bone marrow to restrict Myd88 deletion to intestinal epithelial cells (IEC)
and hematopoietic cells, respectively. K-rasG12Dint mice continued to develop invasive
cancer when Myd88-deletion was restricted to IEC (Extended Data Fig. 4a). Although
adoptive transfer of Myd88–deficient bone marrow slightly reduced tumor incidence, it did
not prevent tumor progression as the number of invasive cancers was comparable to mice
that had received WT bone marrow cells (Extended Data Fig. 4a).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Defective innate immunity has been suggested to shape distinct intestinal microbiota in
mice15–17. To test whether the discrepancy in tumor incidence between germ-line and tissuespecific Myd88-deficiency was due to a change in the gut microbiota, we surveyed microbial
community diversity. Systemic deletion of Myd88 led to an increase in
Peptostreptococcaceae, Deferribacteraceae, and butyrate-producing Ruminococcaceae
(Extended Data Fig. 4b). Furthermore, Enterococcaceae, which were consistently increased
in tissue-specific Myd88 deletion, were no more detectable when Myd88 was deleted in the
germ-line (Extended Data Fig. 5a-c). Remarkably, oncogene and diet-uncoupled antigen
presentation in DCs of the LP was significantly attenuated following Myd88 deletion
(Extended Data Fig. 4c). The possible explanation for differential susceptibility to cancer
could be that deletion of Myd88 in IEC and hematopoietic cells have an additive protective
effect. Alternatively, Myd88 deficiency may have prevented tumor progression through
mechanisms not only related to community changes or mucosal immunity, but rather
through altering IEC differentiation during embryogenesis.

Dietary fibers promote short chain fatty acid (SCFA) formation and provide beneficial
effects on health by selectively affecting a restricted number of bacteria (Bifidobacteria and
Lactobacillus) in the gut18. Indeed, HFD-induced tumor progression was correlated with a
significant reduction in acetate, propionate and butyrate concentrations (Extended Data Fig.
6a, b). To ascertain whether diet-induced tumorigenesis could be halted through further
changes in microbiota, mice were supplemented with prebiotics. Interestingly,
arabinogalactan supplementation did not provide any protective effect (Fig. 3a). However,
there are different prebiotics with the key-differentiating factor being the length of the
chemical chain, which determines where in the GI tract the prebiotic is going to exert its
effect19. Supplementation of diet with galactooligosaccharide (GOS), did not affect tumor
incidence (Fig. 3a) but slightly increased tumor numbers per mouse. CD11c+ DCs, MHC
class II presentation on CD11c+ DCs in the LP and MLN (Extended Data Fig. 6c), as well as
genes involved in immune response (Extended Data Fig. 7a), were equally reduced in KrasG12Dint mice treated or not with GOS (compare to Extended Data Fig. 2). The lack of a
protective effect could be due to the fact that prebiotics had very little or no effect on SCFA
production throughout the gut (Extended Data Fig. 7b). Besides SCFA levels were
significantly lower in the small intestine (Extended Data Fig. 6b).
Therefore, we next aimed to determine whether diet-induced tumor progression could be
prevented when mice were orally treated with butyrate. SCFAs, the end-products of colonic
bacterial fermentation, employ several beneficial effects on the host. They serve as energy
source, modulate intestinal motility, defense barrier, and are suggested to have immuneregulatory functions20,21. Although butyrate supplementation led to only a minor increase in

fecal butyrate concentration (Extended Data Fig. 8a), it markedly reduced tumor incidence
(Fig. 3a). This was associated with a significant increase in the abundance of
Bifidobacteriaceae, Porphyromonadaceae and a sharp decrease in Helicobacteraceae in the
small intestine (Fig. 3b). Interestingly, branching, serration and proliferation was partially
blocked in K-rasG12Dint mice upon treatment with butyrate (Extended Data Fig. 8b). Dietinduced decrease in muc2 expression (Extended Data Fig. 8c) and genes involved in antigen
recognition and immune response were partially restored to the level of the ND group (Fig.
3c). Moreover, compromised DC recruitment was nearly normalized (Fig. 3d). Although
studies mainly focus on colonic bacteria, the small intestine plays a crucial role in
carbohydrate and fat uptake22. However, the concentrations of SCFAs in the small intestine
remained lower than those of the colonic or fecal samples (Extended Data Fig. 6b). Butyrate
appeared to be a very potent SCFA having systemic effects on metabolic parameters during
diet-induced obesity (Extended Data Fig. 8d), although histone H3 and H4 acetylation
remained unaffected (Extended Data Fig. 8e). These results imply that butyrate may exert its
protective effect on tumorigenesis at least in part through changes in bacterial composition
and in regulating K-Ras signaling.

To prove the causal relationship between diet-induced dysbiosis and intestinal cancer,
following one week of a treatment with an antibiotic mix, mice on ND were colonized with
fresh fecal samples from HFD-fed K-rasG12Dint donors. Remarkably, disease could be
transmitted to otherwise healthy K-rasG12Dint mice on ND, but not to LSL-K-rasG12D/+
controls (Fig. 4a and Extended Data Fig. 9a). Comparison of microbial community
composition between K-rasG12Dint mice with or without stool transfer showed an increase in
Lactobacillaceae, Helicobacteraceae and Clostridiaceae reflecting the transfer of the HFDshaped microbiota in the ND phenotype (Fig. 4b and Extended Data Fig. 9b). Muc2
expression was significantly decreased reminiscent of the HFD group (Extended Data Fig.
10a). Recruitment and MHC-II presentation in LP and PP was also compromised (Fig. 4c
and Extended Data Fig. 9c), and glucose clearance during GTT was similar to that of the ND
group (compare Extended Data Fig. 9d to Fig. 1d). These findings provide evidence for a
critical role of a diet-shaped microbiota synergizing with oncogenic K-Ras during
tumorigenesis in the intestine, yet independent of obesity. To further support a causative role
of a distinct shift in bacterial community for tumor progression, mice were treated with
antibiotics. In support of the transfer experiments and a disease-associated microbiota,
antibiotic supplementation completely abolished tumor incidence in K-rasG12Dint mice (Fig.
4d). Down-regulation of genes involved in immune response, mucin profile and
differentiation markers in the duodenum were less pronounced (Extended Data Fig. 7a).
MHC-II presentation on DCs in LP was still compromised (Fig. 4e), but not in MLN
(Extended Data Fig. 10b). Taken together these results suggest a critical role for diet-shaped
dysbiotic bacteria in aggravating oncogene-driven intestinal carcinogenesis (Extended Data
Fig. 10c).
Dysbiotic microbiota perturbing immune-regulatory functions is becoming increasingly
recognized as a hallmark of immune-mediated diseases3. However, diet-associated cancer
development may be based on profound shifts in bacterial communities rather than increased
obesity and metabolic disorder. Thus, personalized dietary interventions may allow

Littermate mice were co-housed randomly regardless of their genotype during different diet
regimen and additional nutritional supplementation. However, during stool transfer
experiments, mice were separated and co-housed according to their genotypes to avoid cross
contamination. During treatment with antibiotics, mice were supplemented with a mix
composed of 0.04 g ampicillin, 0.02 g vancomycin, 4.3 ml neomycin, 8.6 ml metronidazol
dissolved in 200 ml drinking water. During transfer experiments, following antibiotic
treatment for one week, 7 weeks old mice were colonized with fresh stool pellets (9×106
bacteria) from mice fed on HFD (that were fed on HFD for already 24 weeks). GOS
(Bi2muno) (5.5 gr) was provided in 150 ml drinking water, which was refreshed every 2
days. Sodium butyrate (Aldrich, 303410) (50 μg/g mouse in 100 μl H2O) and
arabinogalactan (Fluka, A-09788) (0.01 g/g mouse in 100 μl H2O) were provided orally
three times a week. K-rasG12Dint mice were further crossed to Myd88fl/fl and Myd88−/−
animals (Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME USA). During adoptive transfer experiments,
six weeks old K-rasG12Dint mice were irradiated (9 Gy) and 2×106 bone marrow cells from
Myd88−/− or wildtype mice were transferred by tail vein injection to recipients. The
procedures were approved by the Regierung von Oberbayern.
Human Samples
Human samples were collected with informed consent. Histological sections were
microscopically evaluated after H&E staining by pathologists. All procedures were
performed according to the recommendation of the ethics committee of LMU.
Glucose Tolerance Test (GTT)

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Following 9 hours of fasting, basal glucose level was detected using a glucometer (Bayer,
#3822850). Mice were injected with 1,5 g/kg body weight glucose (40% glucose solution,
Eifelfango) and blood glucose levels were recorded up to 2 hours. Plasma samples were
collected simultaneously to measure insulin secretion with Ultra Sensitive Rat Insulin
ELISA Kit (Crystal Chem, #90060) using a mouse standard (Crystal Chem, #90070). Tests
were assessed in a blinded manner.
RNA Analysis
Total RNA was extracted from small and large intestine using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen,
Hilden, Germany). cDNA was synthesized using SuperScript II Reverse Transcriptase
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA USA). Real-time PCR analysis using Power SYBR Green PCR
Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA USA) was performed on a StepOne Plus
Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems). Primer sequences will be provided upon

Microarray analysis using the GeneChip® Mouse Gene 1.0 ST Array

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

RNA isolation from three biological replicates from duodenum samples was performed
using the Trizol (Invitrogen) method according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The
samples were treated with DNAse I (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO USA). RNA quality was
checked using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA)
microfluidic electrophoresis and only samples with comparable RNA integrity numbers
were processed for microarray analysis.
cDNA was synthesized using 0.3 μg of total RNA. The synthesis of the double-stranded
cDNA was performed using the WT Target Labeling and Control Reagents (Affymetrix,
Santa Clara, CA, USA) and the cleanup was done using the GeneChip® Sample Cleanup
module (Affymetrix).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

In vitro transcription was conducted using the WT Target Labeling Kit (Affymetrix). The
total amount of the reaction product was purified using the GeneChip® cRNA Sample
Cleanup Module (Affymetrix) and quantified with the NanoDrop ND-1000 (Nanodrop
(Thermo), Wilmington, DE USA). cDNA synthesis (ss) was done with the WT Target
Labeling Kit (Affymetrix) and the total ssDNA (5.5 μg) was cleaved 35–200 bp fragments
enzymatically. The degree of fragmentation and the length distribution of the ssDNA were
analyzed by capillary electrophoresis using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent
Technologies). Following fragmentation, a terminal labeling reaction (Biotin) was
conducted using the WT Labeling Kit (Affymetrix).
Biotinylated fragmented ssDNA was then hybridized onto the GeneChip® Mouse Gene 1.0
ST Array (Affymetrix) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The hybridization was
carried out at 45°C in the GeneChip® Hybridization Oven 640 (Affymetrix) for 16 h.
Washing and staining of the arrays on the Gene Chip® Fluidics Station 450 (Affymetrix)
were performed according to the manufacturer’s recommendation. The amplification of the
antibody signal, washing and staining protocols were used to stain the arrays with
streptavidin R-phycoerythrin (SAPE; Invitrogen). SAPE solution was added twice together
with a biotinylated anti-streptavidin antibody (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA)
staining step in order to amplify staining. Finally the arrays were scanned using the
GeneChip® Scanner 3000 7G (Affymetrix).

Microarray data processing and statistical analysis
Affymetrix AGCC Software (version 2.0) (Affymetrix) was used for the extraction of
intensity data and analyzed using the affy23 and Limma package24 of Bioconductor25. The
analysis has been performed exactly as previously described26. The data analysis consisted
of between-array normalization, probe summary, global clustering and PCA-analysis, fitting
the data to a linear model and detection of differential gene expression. To ensure that the
intensities had similar distributions across arrays, quantile-normalization was applied to the
log2-transformed intensity values as a method for between-array normalization27. As for the
summary of probes a median polish procedure was chosen.
Significant changes in the expression of genes between the groups was analyzed by
Empirical Bayes statistics by moderating the standard errors of the estimated values28.

P-values obtained from the moderated t-statistic were corrected for multiple testing with the
Benjamini–Hochberg method29. P-value adjustments guarantee a smaller number of false
positive findings by controlling the false discovery rate (fdr). For each gene the null
hypothesis suggesting there is no differential expression between degradation levels was
rejected when its fdr was lower than 0.05. Samples were assessed in a blinded manner.
Cell isolation from lamina propria (LP)
Intestinal tissue was cut into small pieces, shaken vigorously in 25 ml RPMI and washed 3
times with PBS. Tissue pieces were then incubated in 50 ml PBS containing 0.015 g DTT
and 500 μl 0.5 M EDTA with constant shaking for 20 min at 37°C. The pieces were then
collected and transferred in 10 ml RPMI containing 50 μl DNase l grade II (100 mg/ml) and
50 μl Collagenase D (100 mg/ml), and incubated further for 25 min in a rotating incubator at
37°C. Cells were passed through a cell strainer, centrifuged at 194 g for 5 min, and the
resulting pellet was resuspended in FACS-buffer (2% FCS/PBS).
Cell isolation from Peyer′s Patches (PP)

PPs were excised from the intestine. They were incubated for 20 min in a mixture of 3 ml
RPMI, 15 μl Collagenase D (100 mg/ml) and 15 μl DNase I grade II (20 mg/ml) at 37°C.
The solution was then passed through a cell strainer and incubated for 10 min at 37°C. The
reaction was stopped by the addition of 10 μl 0.5 M EDTA, and the volume was adjusted to
10 ml with RPMI. After centrifugation at 249 g for 5 min, cells were resuspended in FACSbuffer.
Cell isolation from mesenteric lymph node (MLN)
MLNs were collected in 5 ml 2% FCS/PBS, sheared on glass slides, and passed through 100
μm and 70 μm filters, respectively. Following centrifugation at 194 g for 5 min at 4°C,
erythrocytes were lysed with 1 ml of Red blood cell lysing buffer (Sigma) for 5 min at room
temperature. Pellets were then washed in 2% FCS/PBS, centrifuged and resuspended in
FACS-buffer.

After cell isolation from LP, PP, and MLN, approximately 1 × 106 cells were stained with
0.5 μg/ml Ethidium monoazide (EMA) (Sigma, #E2028) to stain dead cells for 15 min under
light. Cells were washed and incubated with CD16/32 Fc Block (BD Pharmingen, Clone:

Stool samples were freshly collected and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. Genomic
DNA was isolated from 200 mg frozen fecal samples using the Qiagen Stool DNA
Extraction Kit. PCR amplification of the V1-V3 region of bacterial 16S rDNA was
performed using primers (338F- 5′-ACTCCTACGGGAGGCAGCAG-3′, 806R- 5′GGACTACCAGGGTATCTAAT-3′) incorporating the FLX Titanium adapters and a
sample barcode sequence. The PCR was made based on ‘Amplicon Library Preparation
Method’ (Roche) using FastStart High Fidelity PCR System (Roche), 10 mM PCR
Nucleotide Mix (Roche) and 10 ng stool DNA per reaction in a 25 μl reaction volume. After
purification of the product on a 1.2 % agarose gel, equal concentrations of amplicons were
pooled from each sample. Emulsion PCR and GS FLX Amplicon sequencing were
performed according to the Roche Titanium series chemistry.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Pyrosequenced amplicon libraries were screened for quality characteristics, chimeric
sequences, and PCR/pyrosequencing-induced duplication artifacts using AmpliconNoise and
Perseus software version 1.28 as described in Quince et al.30. Cleaned data sets were
processed using the Qiime amplicon analysis pipeline version 1.7.031. Briefly, sequences
were clustered into distance-based (97% similarity) operational taxonomic units (OTUs)
using mothur version 1.30.232. Representatives of each OTU were aligned to GreenGenes
core set alignment33 using PyNAST version 1.134. Taxonomic assignments for each OTU
were made using the Ribosomal Database Project (RDP) Classifier version 2.235.
LEfSe results on microbiomes

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

LEfSe is an algorithm for applying 16S rRNA gene datasets to detect bacterial organisms
and functional characteristics differentially abundant between two or more microbial
environments36. It emphasizes statistical significance, biological consistency and effect
relevance, allowing identification of differentially abundant features that are also consistent
with biologically meaningful categories (subclasses). LEfSe first robustly identifies features
that are statistically different among biological classes. It then performs additional tests to
assess whether these differences are consistent with respect to expected biological behavior.
The non-parametric factorial Kruskal-Wallis (KW) sum-rank test is used to detect features
with significant differential abundance with respect to the class of interest; biological
consistency is subsequently investigated using a set of pairwise tests among subclasses using
the (unpaired) Wilcoxon rank-sum test. As a last step, LEfSe uses LDA to estimate the
effect size of each differentially abundant feature. Samples were assessed in a blinded
manner.
SCFA measurement
Stool samples were freshly collected and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. A 1:5
dilution of the samples was centrifuged and the supernatant mixed with 12 mM Isobutyric
acid, 1 M NaOH and 0.36 M HCIO4. After lyophilization overnight, the remaining was
diluted with acetone and 5 M formic acid, centrifuged and the supernatant used for the
measurement with an HP 5890 series II gas chromatograph from Hewlett-Packard. Samples
were assessed in a blinded manner.

acetylation was determined using EpiQuik Global Histone H3 or H4 Acetylation Assay Kit
(P-4008, P-4009), respectively, according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Statistical analysis
Outcomes on sufficiently metric scales (cell percentage, mRNA levels, SCFA levels, %
histone acetylation) were assessed with linear models (one-way ANOVA), modeling the
mean value of each group, which were defined through mutation, diet and diet
supplementation. Relevant comparisons of mean values between groups were made with
two-sided pairwise t-tests, the null hypotheses stated no difference in means. P-values were
adjusted for the number of comparisons with the Bonferroni method.

Outcomes on discrete/ordinal scale (histological scores) were either assessed using Fisher’s
test or one-way ANOVA models as above. The Fisher test was chosen when one of the
groups to compare comprised only values on a single outcome level, as in such a case the
assumption of equal variances is hardly violated. The two-sided Fisher test was applied to a
two-by-two contingency table classifying the histological scores to either no pathology or
any pathology. The ANOVA method was chosen when both groups had observations on at
least two levels of the histological score and mimicked the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel tests
for linear trends in ordinal outcomes. Adjustments on pairwise t-tests were made using the
single-step method37. Both types of adjustments control the family-wise error rate of making
one or more false discoveries.
Outcomes measured over several time points (glucose tolerance test, insulin values, and
weight curve) were assessed for differences between groups (LSL-K-rasG12D/+ control
animals and K-rasG12Dint mice) with linear models. The models estimated the mean values
of each group-time combination and t-tests were carried out for every pair of mean values at
a specific time point. P-values were adjusted for multiple testing within each time series, i.e.
for 5 to 6 tests for glucose and insulin and for 12 tests in the weight measurements.
Adjustment was done with the single-step method as mentioned above, which is
implemented in the glht (general linear hypothesis) function from R package multcomp.

The number of mice per each group used in an experiment is annotated in the corresponding
figure legend as n. Although no prior sample size estimation was performed, we have used
as many mice per group as possible. No gender differences were observed. Significance of
tests is reported as: ns (not significant), * (p-value ≤ 0.05), ** (p-value ≤ 0.01) and *** (pvalue = 0.001). Statistical tests were performed using Prism4 (GraphPad Software Inc.) and
R (R Core Team, 2013).

Figure 1. HFD accelerates cancer progression

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

a, Experimental scheme shows when and how long special diet was applied before final
analysis. b, Histological scores show tumor incidence in the small intestine under HFD
regimen. Each point represents one animal and lines indicate mean (ND: LSL-K-rasG12D/+
controls n=5, K-rasG12Dint mice n=6; HFD: LSL-K-rasG12D/+ controls n=13, K-rasG12Dint
mice n=16). The scores were assessed using two-sided Fisher test and adjustments on
pairwise t-tests were made using the single-step method. *P = 0.05. c, Histology of small
intestine from K-rasG12Dint mice during mSA development and comparison to human
serrated route. TSA-LGIEN, typical serrated adenoma with low-grade intraepithelial
neoplasm; TSA-HGIEN, typical serrated adenoma with high-grade intraepithelial neoplasm.
d, Gene expression profiles of representative top candidate genes analyzed by microarray
analysis in duodenum samples from littermate LSL-K-rasG12D/+ controls and K-rasG12Dint
mutants after ND or HFD (n=3 per group). P-values were obtained from the moderated tstatistic and corrected for multiple testing with the Benjamini–Hochberg method. e,
Representative flow cytometric analysis showing MHC class II expression in CD11c+ and
CD11b+ cell populations from lamina propria (LP) in littermate mice.

a, Experimental scheme indicates additional nutritional supplementation during HFD and
the time point for data analysis. Histological scores of the small intestine in K-rasG12Dint
mice on HFD (n=16) compared to that of after arabinogalactan (LSL-K-rasG12D/+ controls
n=5, K-rasG12Dint mice n=5), GOS (LSL-K-rasG12D/+ controls n=10, K-rasG12Dint mice
n=12) and butyrate (LSL-K-rasG12D/+ controls n=6, K-rasG12Dint mice n=7)
supplementation. Each point represents one animal and lines indicate mean. The scores were
assessed using one-way ANOVA and adjustments on pairwise t-tests were made using the
single-step method. *P ≤ 0.05. not significant, ns. b, LEfSe results show bacteria that were
statistically different among K-rasG12Dint mice on HFD treated (n=5) or not (n=8) with
butyrate and indicated the effect size of each differentially abundant bacteria in the small
intestine. c, The expression profiles of selected top candidate genes involved in antigen
recognition, immune response, and immune cell recruitment in duodenum samples from
LSL-K-rasG12D/+ controls and littermate K-rasG12Dint animals (n=3 per group). P-values
were obtained from the moderated t-statistic and corrected for multiple testing with the
Benjamini–Hochberg method. d, FACS analysis of LP cells from LSL-K-rasG12D/+ control
and K-rasG12Dint littermate animals on HFD treated with (LSL-K-rasG12D/+ controls n=4, KrasG12Dint mice n=7) or without (LSL-K-rasG12D/+ controls n=2, K-rasG12Dint mice n=2)

Figure 4. Disease-associated bacteria can be transmitted to healthy K-rasG12Dint animals and
antibiotic treatment completely abolishes tumorigenesis

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

a, Experimental scheme indicates stool transfer from HFD-fed donors, that were on the diet
regimen for already 24 weeks at the time of experiment, to healthy 7-week old K-rasG12Dint
recipients on ND following one week of antibiotic treatment. Histological score of the small
intestine suggested delivery of disease-associated microbiota and increased tumor incidence
in the recipient K-rasG12Dint mice (LSL-K-rasG12D/+ controls n=6, K-rasG12Dint mice n=11).
Each point represents one animal and lines indicate means. The scores were assessed using
two-sided Fisher test and adjustments on pairwise t-tests were made using the single-step
method. b, LEfSe results show bacteria that were statistically different among K-rasG12Dint
mice that have received (n=6) or not (n=3) stool transfer on ND. Increased and decreased
abundance of bacteria in K-rasG12Dint mice that received stool transfer are shown in green
and red, respectively. c, FACS analysis of LP cells after stool transfer. P-values were
determined by one-way ANOVA and adjusted for the number of comparisons with the
Bonferroni method. Error bars indicate s.e.m. *P = 0.05, **P = 0.001, ***P = 0.0001. #P =
0.05, compared to littermate controls. d, Experimental scheme indicating the application of
antibiotic regimen during the course of HFD and the time point for data analysis.
Histological scores of the small intestine samples showed complete protection from tumor
incidence in the K-rasG12Dint mice (HFD+Abx: LSL-K-rasG12D/+ controls n=7, K-rasG12Dint
mice n=7). Each point represents one animal and lines indicate means. The scores were
assessed using two-sided Fisher test and adjustments on pairwise t-tests were made using the
single-step method. **P = 0.001. e, FACS analysis of cells from the LP showed recruitment
and surface antigen presentation on CD11c+ DCs in disease-free K-rasG12Dint mice after
treatment with antibiotics (LSL-K-rasG12D/+ controls n=5, K-rasG12Dint mice n=7). P-values
