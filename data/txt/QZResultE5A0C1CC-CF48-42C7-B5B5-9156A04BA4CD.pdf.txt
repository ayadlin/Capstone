Abstract
The retinoblastoma (RB) tumor suppressor is mutated or
functionally inactivated in the majority of human malignancies, and p16INK4a-cyclin D1-cyclin-dependent kinase 4-RB
pathway aberrations are present in nearly all cases of non–
small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Here, the distinct role of RB
loss in tumorigenic proliferation and sensitivity to chemotherapeutics was determined in NSCLC cells. Attenuation of
RB led to a proliferative advantage in vitro and aggressive
tumorigenic growth in xenograft models. Clinically, such
aggressive disease is treated with genotoxic and cytotoxic
chemotherapeutic agents. In vitro analysis showed that RB
deficiency resulted in bypass of the checkpoint response to
multiple chemotherapeutic challenges concomitant with an
elevated apoptotic response. Correspondingly, RB deficiency
in xenograft models led to increased chemosensitivity.
However, this response was transient, and a durable response
was dependent on prolonged chemotherapeutic administration. Together, these findings show that although RB deficiency enhances sensitivity to chemotherapeutic challenge,
efficient and sustainable response is highly dependent on the
specific therapeutic regimen, in addition to the molecular
environment. [Cancer Res 2007;67(17):8264–73]

Introduction
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide
with over one million deaths annually (1). It is estimated that
>170,000 new cases will be diagnosed in the United States in 2006
alone (2). Lung cancer accounts for more deaths than the
combined fatalities of breast, colon, and prostate cancers, the next
three leading causes of cancer mortality. The 5-year survival rate
after diagnosis of lung cancer is merely 14%, compared with 86%
for breast cancer, 61% for colon cancer, and 96% for prostate cancer
(2). First-line therapy for early-stage non–small cell lung cancer
(NSCLC), which accounts for >80% of lung cancer, remains surgical
resection; however, for patients who receive surgical resection,
5-year survival rates are still below 50%. Small cell lung cancer
(SCLC), accounting for under 20% of lung cancer, is primarily
treated with chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Nonsurgical
treatments for NSCLC, including chemotherapy and radiation
therapy, constitute the primary therapeutic modalities for advanced disease. Importantly, adjuvant chemotherapy after complete surgical resection has recently been shown to improve

survival (3). Thus, chemotherapeutic treatment is used for most
stages of NSCLC. Hence, a better understanding of the molecular
determinants of chemotherapeutic response will directly affect
outcome in the majority of patients with lung cancer and would be
useful for better directing of such regimens.
The retinoblastoma (RB) tumor suppressor is a potent inhibitor
of cellular proliferation which is functionally inactivated via an
assortment of discrete mechanisms, mutated, or genetically lost in
the majority of human tumors (4–6). The p16INK4a-cyclin D1-cyclindependent kinase 4 (CDK4)-RB pathway is inactivated in the
majority of NSCLC (7–13). In NSCLC, RB is inactivated through
disparate mechanisms including mutation (7–9), deregulated
phosphorylation (14, 15), alternative splicing (13), or homozygous
deletion or point mutation (16–19). Additionally, p16INK4a deficiency is particularly frequent in NSCLC (20, 21), resulting in
compromised RB family function. Conversely, abnormalities of
RB are present in >90% of SCLC whereas p16INK4a abnormalities
are rare (21). In its active hypophosphorylated state, RB acts as
a transcriptional corepressor at the promoters of E2F-regulated
genes, thereby blocking cell cycle progression (22–24). Upon
mitogenic signaling, RB is inactivated through hyperphosphorylation by the action of CDK4-cyclin D and CDK2-cyclin E complexes
(22, 25, 26). These actions are sufficient to release RB from E2F
promoters relieving transcriptional repression, thereby allowing
cell cycle progression. In contrast, in the presence of antimitogenic
signaling, RB remains in its active hypophosphorylated state,
inhibiting cell cycle progression.
Appropriate coordination of the cell cycle maintains genomic
integrity by ensuring faithful replication and partitioning of the
genome (27, 28). Loss of RB function leads to deregulation of cell
cycle control such that cells respond inappropriately to chemotherapeutic challenge (29–31). The mechanisms of this are not
completely understood, but discrete targets of RB-mediated transcriptional repression include genes involved in cell cycle control
and DNA repair. Some of these genes are, in fact, the targets of
certain chemotherapeutic agents commonly used in the clinical
arena (32). For example, the known RB targets thymidylate
synthase and topoisomerase IIa are the targets of 5-fluorouracil
(5-FU) and etoposide (VP-16), respectively.
With functional inactivation of the p16INK4a-cyclin D1-CDK4-RB
pathway occurring in most human cancers and deregulation of RB
activity disrupting cell cycle checkpoint control and thereby altering
chemosensitivity (33–36), RB status represents a significant modifier
of chemosensitivity in lung cancer. As the p16INK4a-cyclin D1-CDK4RB pathway is inactivated in the majority of NSCLC and
chemotherapy is the primary nonsurgical treatment modality for
most stages of disease, NSCLC can serve as an ideal system to
evaluate the discrete mechanisms of p16INK4a-cyclin D1-CDK4-RB
pathway inactivation on therapeutic response. Here, we use short
hairpin RNA (shRNA) to effectively knockdown RB expression in
NSCLC cells, resulting in deregulation of E2F target genes and

increase in proliferative capacity in vitro. Additionally, we show
that RB deficiency allows cells to inappropriately progress though
the cell cycle in the presence of chemotherapeutic agents, resulting
in elevated levels of apoptosis. Moreover, NSCLC xenograft tumors
deficient in RB activity exhibit accelerated tumor growth and
respond more effectively to chemotherapeutic challenge. Together,
these results show that RB deficiency enhances proliferative and
tumorigenic capacity, as well as elicits more efficacious responses to
chemotherapeutic challenge in lung cancer cells in vitro and in vivo.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture and transfection. NSCLC lines H1299, H520, and H522
(National Cancer Institute) were obtained from American Type Culture

Collection. All three lines harbor wild-type RB and all express greatly
reduced or undetectable p16INK4a. H1299 cells are p53 null, whereas H520
cells express greatly reduced levels of p53 mRNA relative to normal lung
tissue but exhibit no gross structural DNA abnormalities and H522 cells
express mutant p53. All cell lines were maintained in RPMI 1640 (Cellgro,
Mediatech) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Biofluids) and supplemented with 100 units/mL penicillin-streptomycin and 2 mmol/L
L-glutamine (Mediatech). Cells were cultured at 37jC in a 5% CO2
humidified incubator. H520 cells were transfected via the FuGene6 lipidbased reagent (Roche) with either pMSCVpuro (MSCV)-Rb3c containing a
validated Rb shRNA construct (37) and a puromycin resistance gene or
MSCV containing an empty vector control and a puromycin resistance gene.
Transfectants were selected and maintained in 2.5 Ag/mL puromycin
(CalBiochem). H1299 and H522 cell lines were infected with a retrovirus
encoding a shRB plasmid (MSCV-LMP-Rb88) or the virus encoding the

retrovirus encoding empty vector (MSCV) or si-Rb88 (Rb88). H1299 cells were additionally infected with retrovirus encoding a nonspecific shRNA (si-NS ). H520 cells
were transfected with MSCV vector or MSCV-Rb3c shRNA vector and selected with puromycin for stable incorporation of the plasmids. Whole-cell lysates were
collected from both lines and immunoblotted for expression levels of RB, p130, and p107. Cdk4 served as a loading control. B, stable lines were screened for RB
expression by immunofluorescence. Images were taken at equal exposures. Bars, 20 Am. C, lysates represented in (A) were immunoblotted for expression levels of
topoisomerase IIa, cyclin A, and cyclin E. Cdk4 was used as a loading control.

supplemented with a protease inhibitor mixture (35). After brief sonication
and clarification, protein concentrations were determined with the Bio-Rad
DC Protein Assay (Bio-Rad) and equal protein was loaded and subjected to
SDS-PAGE. After transfer to Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore Corp.),
specific proteins were probed using the following primary antibodies: RB
polyclonal antiserum (30), topoisomerase IIa (H-231 polyclonal; Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, Inc.), Cyc A (H-432 polyclonal; Santa Cruz), Cyc E (HE-12
monoclonal; Santa Cruz), p107 (C-18 polyclonal; Santa Cruz), p130 (C-20
polyclonal; Santa Cruz), and cdk4 (H-22 polyclonal; Santa Cruz) used as a
loading control. Proteins were detected using horseradish peroxidase–
conjugated secondary antibody (Pierce Biotechnologies, Inc.) and were
visualized using Enhanced Western Lightning chemiluminescence (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Inc.).
Immunofluorescence. Approximately 3  105 cells were plated on
coverslips and allowed to adhere overnight. Cells were fixed in 3.7%
formaldehyde and permeablized in 0.4% Triton X-100 for 20 min at room
temperature. After blocking in 5% goat serum, coverslips were incubated
with mouse monoclonal anti-human RB antibody (Rb G3-245; BD
Biosciences) for 1 h at 37jC. Coverslips were then incubated with goat
anti-mouse rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.) in addition to 0.1 Ag/mL Hoechst 33258 (SigmaAldrich) nuclear stain. Coverslips were mounted on glass slides and
visualized by indirect immunofluorescence.
Flow cytometry. Exponentially growing cells were pulsed with BrdUrd
(Amersham, GE Healthcare BioSciences Corp.) for 1 h. Cells were
trypsinized and fixed in 80% ice-cold ethanol. Cells were stained with
FITC-conjugated anti-BrdUrd (BD Biosciences) and propidium iodide
(0.2 Ag/AL), and then subjected to flow cytometry. Samples were analyzed
and quantitated on a Beckman Coulter Cell Lab Quanta SC flow cytometer.

BrdUrd and TUNEL assays. Approximately 1  105 cells were seeded
onto coverslips and allowed to adhere overnight. Cells were then treated
with PBS, 16 Amol/L cis-diaminedichloroplatinum II (CDDP, cisplatin; Ben
Venue Laboratories, Inc.), 24 Amol/L VP-16 (Sigma), or 50 Amol/L 5-FU
(Sigma) for 72 h. For BrdUrd analysis, cells were pulsed with BrdUrd for
4 h before fixing in 3.7% formaldehyde and stained for BrdUrd as previously
described (38). For TUNEL assays, cells were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde and
stained according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Roche). Graphs represent
three independent experiments, each with at least three fields of at least
200 cells counted per experiment.
Xenografts. Tumors were grown as xenografts in 6-week-old to 8-weekold female athymic nude mice (Harlan Sprague-Dawley, Inc.) by s.c. flank
injection of 2.5  105 cells in 150 AL PBS with 50 AL Matrigel (BD
BioSciences). Tumors were measured with calipers every 48 h, and volume
was calculated as v = p(width2  length)/6. When tumors reached a volume
of 90 to 110 mm3, mice were randomized into treatment groups and
chemotherapy was initiated. Treatment groups were as follows: 0.9% saline
in 100 AL daily for 5 days, 5 mg/kg CDDP in 100 AL 0.9% saline daily for
5 days, 20 mg/kg VP-16 in 100 AL 0.9% saline daily for 3 days, or 30 mg/kg
5-FU in 100 AL 0.9% saline daily for 5 days. Treatments were either given in
one course or continued until euthanization with 3 days between courses.
All treatments were done through i.p. injection. Two hours before
euthanization, mice were injected i.p. with 150 mg/kg BrdUrd in 100 AL
0.9% saline. Mice were euthanized by CO2 anesthetization, followed by
cervical dislocation before the tumor reached a volume of 3000 mm3. All
animal experiments were conducted in accordance with the NIH Guide for
Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and were approved by the University of
Cincinnati Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.

sections, and adhered to slides. For immunohistochemical analysis, sections
were deparaffinized in xylene and rehydrated through a series of graded
ethanol/water solutions. BrdUrd staining was done with a detection kit
(Zymed Laboritories, Inc.) as recommended by the manufacturer. Sections
were counterstained in Harris hematoxylin (Poly Scientific), dehydrated
through a series of ethanol/water solutions, and overlaid with coverslips in
permanent mounting medium (Permount, Fisher Scientific). BrdUrd
incorporation was scored by counting at least three random fields of at
least 500 cells per section. Graphs represent at least three independent
tumors per treatment group. TUNEL staining was done with the DeadEnd
Colorimetric TUNEL system kit (Promega) as recommended by the
manufacturer. Sections were counterstained, dehydrated, covered, and
counted as above.
Statistical analysis. All statistical analyses were done with GraphPad
Prism (GraphPad Prism Software, Inc.). P values were calculated by
performing one-way ANOVA analysis with a Newman-Keuls posttest.

Results
RB deficiency in NSCLC lines results in deregulation of RB/
E2F targets and increased proliferation in vitro and in vivo.
The p16INK4a-cyclin D1-CDK4-RB pathway is targeted at high
frequency through heterogeneous mechanisms in lung cancer.
Here, we determined the specific effect of RB loss on lung cancer
cells using the human lung cancer cell lines H1299, H520, and H522,
which harbor wild-type RB yet contain other aberrations in
p16INK4a-cyclin D1-CDK4-RB pathway function, namely loss of
p16INK4a expression (absent in H1299 and H520, greatly reduced in
H522), as well as exhibit differing p53 status (null in H1299, greatly
reduced at the mRNA level in H520, and mutated in H522). RB
knockdown was achieved using validated shRNA vectors (37, 38)
that target human Rb. After selection, RB expression was
determined via immunoblotting (Fig. 1A) and confirmed by
immunofluorescence microscopy (Fig. 1B). The expression of RB
was virtually undetectable in all three cell lines, and hence, these
cells were considered RB deficient. To show that compensation by
other pocket proteins did not occur to a significant degree, levels
of p107 and p130 were shown to be minimally altered in cells
deficient in RB (Fig. 1A). Because it is known that RB regulates
numerous downstream targets, expression of documented RB/E2F
targets was then determined. Levels of cyclin A and cyclin E, as well
as topoisomerase IIa, were found to be increased with RB
attenuation in all three lung cancer cell lines (Fig. 1C). This was
not a nonspecific effect as the scrambled shRNA did not effect RB
expression or the expression of target genes (Fig. 1A-C). Thus,
efficient knockdown of RB expression was achieved, resulting in
the deregulation of downstream RB/E2F targets.
To determine the influence of RB deficiency on lung cancer
proliferation rates, H1299, H520, and H522 cells proficient (Fig. 2A,
left and right) and deficient (Fig. 2A, middle) in RB activity were
subjected to flow cytometric and BrdUrd incorporation analyses.
RB-deficient cells showed an enhanced rate of proliferation shown
by an increase in cells in S phase, a nearly 10% increase in BrdUrd
incorporation in H1299 and H520 cells, and roughly a 5% increase
in H522 cells. This effect was validated in H1299 cells harboring the
nonspecific shRNA which showed no significant change in cell
cycle distribution, S phase, or BrdUrd incorporation, compared
with the empty vector control (Fig. 2A). To determine the longterm effect on proliferation after attenuation of RB expression, cells
were subjected to growth assays by counting viable cells via trypan
blue exclusion every 48 h for 14 days. RB knockdown resulted in a
significant increase in long-term proliferation in all three cell lines

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (17). September 1, 2007

compared with controls (Fig. 2B), demonstrating that RB loss
greatly accelerates proliferation in NSCLC cells.
To evaluate the biological effect of RB loss on oncogenic growth,
RB-proficient and RB-deficient H1299 and H520 cells (2.5  105)
were s.c. injected contralaterally into the flanks of nude mice to be
grown as xenografts. Within 5 days postinjection, H1299 and H520
tumors were palpable and were measured by calipers every 48 h
throughout the experiment. Xenografts of RB-deficient H1299 and
H520 cells grew more rapidly than those of RB-proficient cells.
This effect was more pronounced in the H520 cells as a result of
the duration of the experiment (Fig. 2C). Mice were injected i.p.
with 150 mg/kg BrdUrd 2 h before euthanization, and tumor
sections were stained for BrdUrd to confirm that the increase in
tumor volume was the cumulative result of increased proliferation.
H1299 and H520 RB-deficient tumors showed a higher rate of
BrdUrd incorporation (44.3% and 26.3%, respectively) compared
with RB proficient tumors (21.2% and 17.8%, respectively; Fig. 2D).
Representative micrographs of both RB-deficient and RB-proficient
tumor sections are shown in Fig. 2D (middle and right). Thus, loss
of RB, even in the context of a highly aggressive NSCLC cell line,
accelerates proliferation, as well as tumorigenic progression, in an
in vivo NSCLC xenograft model.
RB deficiency causes an increase in sensitivity to chemotherapeutic exposure in vitro. Lung cancer is treated with a
variety of chemotherapeutic agents that act through distinct
mechanisms. Initially, we determined effective doses of certain
clinically relevant agents by performing dose-response analyses
(data not shown) for subsequent treatments. To investigate the
effect of loss of RB activity on the sensitivity to chemotherapeutic
treatment, RB-proficient and RB-deficient H1299, H520, and H522
cells were treated with PBS (control), 16 Amol/L cisplatin (CDDP),
24 Amol/L VP-16, or 50 Amol/L 5-FU for 72 h. These cells were
subsequently labeled with BrdUrd, and BrdUrd incorporation was
determined by immunofluorescence. RB deficient cells showed a
significantly higher incorporation of BrdUrd compared with RBproficient cells in the presence of therapeutic challenge (Fig. 3A).
Thus, RB is required for effective checkpoint control after exposure
to chemotherapeutic agents. H1299, H520, and H522 cells exposed to
the same drugs as described in Fig. 3A were also investigated to
determine the relative level of apoptosis dependent upon RB expression. After chemotherapeutic exposure, cells deficient in RB were
found to have significantly higher levels of apoptosis, as determined
by TUNEL staining, compared with cells proficient in RB (Fig. 3B).
Therefore, RB loss permits progression through the cell cycle despite
genotoxic exposure. However, a concomitant greater degree of
apoptosis is observed. Thus, the net effect on sensitivity represents
the interplay between cellular proliferation and apoptosis.
Lung cancer xenografts deficient in RB exhibit an increase
in sensitivity to chemotherapeutic agents. To test the overall
influence of RB loss on therapeutic response, we used the H520
and H1299 xenograft models described in Fig. 2C and D. Tumors
were grown to a volume of 90 to 110 mm3, and treatment was
then initiated. To determine the role of RB on the effect of shortterm exposure to chemotherapeutic agents, mice received either
5 mg/kg CDDP daily for 5 days (H520 and H1299), 20 mg/kg
VP-16 daily for 3 days (H520 only), or 30 mg/kg 5-FU daily for
5 days (H520 only). Black bars in graphs (Fig. 4A) represent
administration of treatment. After exposure to each of these
agents, RB-deficient tumors either regressed slightly in the
presence of 5-FU (Fig. 4A, bottom) or ceased growing during
treatment in the presence of CDDP and VP-16 (Fig. 4A, middle

and top). However, with discontinuation of treatment, RBdeficient tumors showed a rapid recovery, and both RB-proficient
and RB-deficient tumors resumed growth at similar rates in all
therapeutic groups (Fig. 4B).
To investigate the role of RB on long-term chemotherapeutic
treatment, mice received the same doses of agents as previously
described, but the regimen was maintained with 3 days between
repeated administrations until euthanization (Fig. 5A-D : H1299,
CDDP; H520, CDDP; H520, VP-16; and H520, 5-FU, respectively).
Here, tumors lacking RB expression either ceased proliferating or
regressed slightly compared with tumors proficient in RB (Fig. 5).
With continual exposure to any of the three chemotherapeutic
agents, RB-deficient tumors showed a significantly reduced
incorporation of BrdUrd. Therefore, tumors with attenuated RB
were significantly less proliferative than RB-proficient tumors in
the presence of maintained therapeutic challenge. Not unexpectedly, apoptosis was also found to be significantly higher in RBdeficient tumors in all treatment groups, as determined by TUNEL
staining. Representative micrographs of RB-proficient and RBdeficient H1299 tumors from the CDDP treatment group are shown
(Fig. 5A). Together, these results show that RB-deficient tumors
respond transiently to a single exposure of chemotherapy. Yet,
with prolonged exposure, RB deficiency results in decreased pro-

liferation concomitant with increased apoptosis yielding greater
chemosensitivity.

Discussion
The RB tumor suppressor plays a critical role in control of cell
cycle progression, including arrest mechanisms invoked by genotoxic and cytotoxic insults, such as chemotherapy. The p16INK4acyclin D1-CDK4-RB pathway is disrupted in majority human
malignancies (4–6, 39). In NSCLC, p16INK4a-cyclin D1-CDK4-RB
pathway activity is disrupted through disparate mechanisms in
majority of the cases. Chemotherapy remains the primary modality
for treatment in late-stage NSCLC and is also indicated as adjuvant
therapy in early-stage, surgically resected disease. However, little
is known about the role of RB in regulation and modification of
response to chemotherapeutic challenge in NSCLC.
Loss of RB has been implicated in promoting aberrant proliferation
in the context of cancer etiology. However, much less is known
regarding the effect of RB loss on the progression of tumorigenesis.
Furthermore, it remains unclear how the disparate mechanisms,
through which the p16INK4a-cyclin D1-CDK4-RB pathway is compromised, affect discrete tumor types. In primary fibroblast cell culture
models, loss of RB provides a slight proliferative advantage (40).

deficient in RB show a transient increase in
sensitivity to chemotherapeutic exposure.

contralateral flanks of nude mice. Tumors

All injections were done via i.p. delivery.

However, the extent to which RB participates in proliferative control
is highly context-dependent, and in specific settings, loss of RB
function is paradoxically associated with inhibition of tumorigenic
proliferation (41). Here, we sought to delineate the effect of RB
deficiency on the control of proliferation in the more genetically
complex, but clinically significant, setting of NSCLC. We have
previously shown that a Rb shRNA construct can efficiently attenuate
RB expression serving as a model for RB loss in NSCLC, resulting in
deregulation of several E2F target genes, including thymidylate
synthase and topoisomerase IIa, the molecular targets of 5-FU and
VP-16, respectively (37). Here, we showed that, in three lung cancer
cell lines, attenuation of RB caused no alteration in expression of
other pocket proteins (p107 and p130), but the RB/E2F target genes
cyclin A and cyclin E, as well as topoisomerase IIa, are consistently
deregulated (Fig. 1). Subsequent studies of proliferation and cell cycle
analysis showed that, similar to primary cells (42), loss of RB in
NSCLC cells resulted in a modest proliferative advantage in vitro

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (17). September 1, 2007

(Fig. 2). This phenomenon is somewhat surprising because these cells
harbor deficiency of p16INK4a expression and thus, a priori, would
have been expected to already harbor loss of p16INK4a-cyclin D1CDK4-RB pathway activity. Thus, although p16INK4a-cyclin D1-CDK4RB activity is compromised in the majority of human cancers, cells
must retain sufficient RB function to enforce some control over
proliferation. Consistent with these in vitro proliferative characteristics, RB deficiency accelerated tumorigenic growth in NSCLC
xenografts. Interestingly, the influence of RB loss on oncogenic
growth was very pronounced, particularly in the H520 line, suggesting
that under the stress of tumorigenic growth, the effect of RB
deficiency may be more significant than in the context of growth in
culture. This might suggest that the more common p16INK4a-deficient
type of NSCLC is likely to show slower growth than the more rare RBdeficient tumors. Importantly, these effects of RB on proliferation and
tumorigenic growth were apparent although these three cell lines
exhibit variable p53 status, indicating that perturbations in these

RB Deficiency Increases Chemosensitivity in Lung Cancer

Figure 5. RB-deficient lung cancer xenografts exhibit increased chemosensitivity via decreased proliferation and increased apoptosis in the presence of long-term
chemotherapeutic challenge. Cells (2.5  105) in 150 AL PBS with 50 AL Matrigel were injected s.c. into contralateral flanks of nude mice. Tumors were measured
every 2 d. Tumor volume was calculated as v = p (width2  length)/6. When tumors reached f100 mm3, treatment was initiated. H1299 (A) and H520 (B ), 5 mg/kg
CDDP was injected daily for 5 d; H520 (C ), 20 mg/kg VP-16 was injected daily for 3 d; H520 (D ), 30 mg/kg 5-FU was injected daily for 5 d. All treatment
courses were maintained with 3 d between repeated courses until euthanization (top ). Two hours before euthanization, mice were injected with 150 mg/kg
BrdUrd. All injections were done via i.p. delivery. Tumors were removed, fixed, embedded in paraffin, and cut into 5-Am sections. Tumor sections were subjected to
BrdUrd staining. BrdUrd incorporation was quantified, and graphs represent at least three independent tumors with >500 cells scored in three random fields per tumor
section in a blind manner. TUNEL staining was done to determine rates of apoptosis. Apoptosis was quantified, and graphs represent at least three independent
tumors with >500 cells scored in three random fields per tumor section in a blind manner. Representative micrographs are shown in (A) at 200 magnification for
BrdUrd staining (middle ) and 400 magnification for TUNEL staining (bottom ). **, P < 0.01; ***, P < 0.001.

two tumor suppressive pathways function independently in the
context of NSCLC.
Similar to the majority of other cancers, lung cancer is a widely
heterogeneous disease, in terms of genetic anomalies, clinical
presentation, natural history, and response to therapy. In NSCLC,
surgical resection remains the principal treatment modality for
early-stage disease, whereas chemotherapy and radiation therapy
remain the therapeutic modalities for unresectable late-stage
disease. It has been found that in the genetically homogeneous
setting of primary cells, the RB/E2F pathway plays an important
role in mediating cell cycle inhibition, and acute loss of RB leads
to diminished checkpoint response, genomic abnormalities, and
modified sensitivity (29, 35). Here, in the case of NSCLC lines, we
have shown that loss of RB activity allowed the bypass of the
damage checkpoint induced by the chemotherapeutic challenge of
three distinct agents (Fig. 3). Thus, the cell cycle arrest mediated by
such agents seems to commonly function through the presence of
RB. Again, these specific effects on cell cycle are p53-independent,
indicating that the cell cycle responses to 5-FU, VP-16, and CDDP
are intrinsically dependent on RB activity. Importantly, these
results were recapitulated in additional NSCLC cell lines, indicating
that this finding is not unique to a single cell line. Strikingly, in
addition to bypass of checkpoint control, levels of apoptosis were
significantly higher with RB deficiency. In vitro checkpoint bypass
coupled with elevated apoptosis has been observed by others in
primary cultures (43, 44) and most recently in breast cancer models
(36). There exist a multitude of mechanisms through which
p16INK4a-cyclin D1-CDK4-RB deficiency has been suggested to
contribute to cell death after genotoxic damage, including as a
consequence of cell cycle deregulation and higher damage burden,
deregulation of proapoptotic gene products, or via effect on the
p53-pathway. At present, we favor the former mechanisms because
the cell death is occurring independent of p53 function. Thus, in
NSCLC cells, RB deficiency exerted differential effects on
therapeutic challenge, which lead us to directly evaluate the
influence on therapeutic response in a tumor model.
The status of RB activity in lung cancer and its role in
chemotherapeutic response has not been previously addressed.
As the p16INK4a-cyclin D1-CDK4-RB pathway is disrupted in many
human cancers (4–6, 39) and the vast majority of lung cancers (10),
it is important to address the role of RB in chemosensitivity in
a clinically relevant setting. NSCLC xenografts of matched cells,
proficient or deficient in RB, provide an appropriate model to
investigate this role. Here, we have shown that RB-deficient tumors
respond favorably to initial challenge with chemotherapeutic agents,
yet shortly thereafter return to an aggressive neoplastic state (Fig. 4).
This transient sensitivity mimics the in vitro finding that loss of RB
permits an increase in chemosensitivity. However, when tumors
were removed from treatment, they rapidly returned to the previous
aggressive state. This finding is, indeed, reminiscent of certain
clinical responses observed in SCLC, which often harbors the

genetic loss of RB (10). This parallels the results of Meuwissen and
colleagues (45), who noted that in a murine model that development
of the neural phenotype SCLC was dependent on loss of both p53
and RB. In contrast, when a wild-type RB allele was maintained,
NSCLC (adenocarcinoma) ensued. In human SCLC, initial response
to therapy is frequently quite good; however, recurrent disease
commonly arises. Because the RB-deficient NSCLC tumors grow
more rapidly, the strong initial response results in little durable
effect once therapy is discontinued. These results lead us to question
whether multiple treatment regimens would lead to resistance or
enable a durable response. Under these conditions of maintenance
therapy, we found that RB-deficient tumors either discontinued
growth or began to regress, whereas RB-proficient tumors continued
to grow, albeit with reduced kinetics under constant treatment
with chemotherapeutic agents (Fig. 5). Although the mechanisms of
RB-dependent chemosensitivity are not known, it is the subject of
much ongoing research. In the case of prolonged exposure to
therapy, surprisingly, tumors deficient in RB activity ultimately
become less proliferative as shown by diminished BrdUrd incorporation. This could represent a direct cell cycle effect of RB
deficiency, resulting in cellular senescence, or could be a result of
lack of availability of required growth factors, for example, blood
supply or nutrients, which are specifically affecting RB-deficient
tumors. Future studies will address the mechanisms of decreased
proliferation with long-term exposure to chemotherapeutics in the
setting of RB deficiency.
In conclusion, we have shown that attenuation of RB activity in
NSCLC cells results in further deregulation of downstream RB/E2F
targets and leads to not only accelerated proliferation in vitro but
also a heightened tumorigenic capacity in vivo. Furthermore,
disruption of p16INK4a-cyclin D1-CDK4-RB pathway activity allows
these cells to bypass specific checkpoint responses to chemotherapeutic agents, leading to enhanced apoptosis and ultimately an
increase in sensitivity and response to chemotherapeutic challenge
in a xenograft model. Further delineation of the mechanisms of
altered sensitivity and modes of cytotoxicity with loss of RB
function is needed. The improved understanding of this relationship and the knowledge of RB-dependent chemosensitivity will
contribute to the individualized targeting of therapy based on the
molecular characteristics of human tumors.
