Abstract
Lung cancer is a genetically heterogeneous disease characterized by the acquisition of somatic mutations in numerous
protein kinases, including components of the rat sarcoma
viral oncogene homolog (RAS) and AKT signaling cascades.
These pathways intersect at various points, rendering this
network highly redundant and suggesting that combined
mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MEK) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)
inhibition may be a promising drug combination that can
overcome its intrinsic plasticity. The MEK inhibitors, CI-1040
or PD0325901, in combination with the mTOR inhibitor,
rapamycin, or its analogue AP23573, exhibited dose-dependent synergism in human lung cancer cell lines that was
associated with suppression of proliferation rather than
enhancement of cell death. Concurrent suppression of MEK
and mTOR inhibited ribosomal biogenesis by 40% within 24 h
and was associated with a decreased polysome/monosome
ratio that is indicative of reduced protein translation
efficiency. Furthermore, the combination of PD0325901 and
rapamycin was significantly superior to either drug alone or
PD0325901 at the maximum tolerated dose in nude mice
bearing human lung tumor xenografts or heterotransplants.
Except for a PTEN mutant, all tumor models had sustained
tumor regressions and minimal toxicity. These data (a)
provide evidence that both pathways converge on factors that
regulate translation initiation and (b) support therapeutic
strategies in lung cancer that simultaneously suppress the RAS
and AKT signaling network. [Cancer Res 2007;67(23):11300–8]

Introduction
Lung cancer is characterized by somatic mutations in many
different protein kinases (1). Major components of the reticular
activating system (RAS) and AKT signaling network are deregulated
via genetic and epigenetic mechanisms in many human cancers
including lung. In addition to p53, epidermal growth factor
receptor and K-RAS are the most commonly acquired somatic
mutations in both adenocarcinoma and bronchioalveolar carcinomas occurring in f21% and 18% of patients, respectively.4 PTEN is
mutated in f7% of non–small cell lung cancers (NSCLC), and by

immunohistochemistry, f25% of NSCLC tumors have lost PTEN
protein expression, presumably by promoter methylation and/or
loss of heterozygosity (2, 3). Somatic mutations in the phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase (PI3K) catalytic subunit a
occur in f3% of NSCLC (1, 4).
Tumor growth is often dependent on the continued activation of
one or two signaling pathways, termed oncogene addiction. Such
tumors exhibit preferential sensitivity to pharmacologic inhibitors
of these pathways (5). Thus, the development of effective therapies
for many cancers, including lung, is dependent on accurate
molecular classification.
There has been a longstanding interest in inhibitors that target
aberrant mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling,
precipitated by the finding that some cancer cell lines with
B-RAFV600E mutations exhibit preferential sensitivity to mitogenactivated protein (MAP)/extracellular signal-regulated (ERK) kinase (MEK)-directed therapy (6). In melanoma, colorectal, and
pancreatic cancers, somatic mutations of B-RAF are predominately
localized to residueV600E; however, in lung cancer, this residue is
mutated at a considerably lower frequency. Activating B-RAF
mutations occur in f3% of NSCLC (in squamous and adenocarcinoma histologies4) at two predominant locations, B-RAF466 469
and B-RAF597 600, the latter of which has been only identified in
one human NSCLC cell line to date (7–9).
Inhibitors directed at components of RAS and AKT pathways are
in various stages of development. CI-1040 (Pfizer) is an orally bioavailable and specific MEK inhibitor that has completed phase II
clinical evaluation (10, 11). PD0325901 (Pfizer), a second generation
MEK inhibitor, is currently undergoing clinical evaluation and has a
significantly improved pharmacokinetic profile compared with CI1040 (12). AKT signaling is highly pleitropic (13), and although there
are no PI3K-AKT inhibitors currently in the clinic, strides are being
made in the development of effective candidates for therapeutic use
(14, 15). One of the primary AKT effectors is the mTOR, a serine/
threonine kinase that integrates mitogenic and nutrient signaling to
regulate proliferation, cell cycle progression, mRNA translation,
cytoskeletal organization, and survival (16). mTOR forms a
rapamycin and nutrient-sensitive complex, mTORC1, and a second
growth-factor sensitive and nutrient-sensitive complex, mTORC2
(reviewed in ref. 16). Rapamycin inhibits the function of mTORC1 by
blocking the phosphorylation of two major downstream proteins:
p70S6 kinase (p70S6K) and eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 4Ebinding protein 1 (4E-BP1; refs. 17–19). Suppression of mTORC1
activates AKT kinase due to a negative feedback loop that exists

MEK and mTOR Inhibition in NSCLC

between p70S6K and insulin receptor substate-1 (IRS1; ref. 16).
AP23573 (Ariad) is a rapamycin analogue that is being evaluated in
phase II clinical trials (20).
The genetic heterogeneity of lung cancer renders it a huge
therapeutic challenge, compounded by the fact that the major
signaling network that is deregulated, RAS-AKT, has complex
positive and negative feedback control (21) and bifurcates at
several levels (22–24). In signaling networks, it is unlikely that
inhibition of only one component will confer therapeutic benefit,
even in the presence of an ‘‘addicted’’ pathway. Thus, there is a
strong rationale for multitargeted suppression of the RAS-PI3K/
AKT network.
Herein, we test this logic using combined MEK and mTOR
inhibitors in human NSCLC cell lines and tumor models grown in
nude mice. Sensitivity to MEK-directed therapy was observed in
non-V600E B-RAF mutant lung cancer cell lines, although at
reduced sensitivity relative to B-RAFV600E mutant cells. Synergism
was observed in most cell lines except PTEN mutant H157 cells,
and four of five tumor models evaluated had sustained tumor
regressions after treatment with the combination relative to either
MEK or mTOR inhibition alone. Mechanistically, combined
suppression of MEK and mTOR potently dephosphorylated
ribosomal protein S6Ser235/236 and caused decreased ribosomal
biogenesis and protein translation efficiency. These data substantiate accumulating evidence of a role for RAS, in addition to mTOR,
in ribosomal protein S6 regulation through a highly conserved
mechanism that oversees the rate of cellular proliferation.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines, antibodies, and reagents. Cells were purchased from the
American Type Culture Collection, except H157 and H1703 that were
obtained from National Cancer Institute (NCI)/Navy Medical Oncology
[developed by H. Oie and Dr. F. Kaye (Bethesda, MD)]. Cells were cultured
in RPMI containing 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 IU/mL), and
streptomycin (100 Ag/mL; Invitrogen). Experiments were performed using
asynchronous cells grown in 10% serum to 70% to 80% confluence. All
antibodies were from Cell Signaling Technologies except the following:
AKT1/2, ERK1/2, and phospho-4E-BP1ser65/Thr70 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc). Stock solutions of the MEK inhibitors CI-1040 and PD0325901
(Pfizer) were formulated in DMSO for in vitro experiments. The mTOR
inhibitors AP23573 and rapamycin were obtained from Ariad Pharmaceuticals, Inc., and the Drug Synthesis and Chemistry Branch, NCI,
respectively, and formulated in ethanol for in vitro experiments. LY294002
(Cell Signaling Technologies) was formulated in DMSO. Drugs were used
at a final concentration of 0.03% to 0.06% vehicle. Unless stated
otherwise, statistical analyses were performed using two-tailed unpaired
Student’s t tests.
Cell proliferation assay and multiple drug effect analysis. Cells were
seeded at 2 to 3  104/mL, and serial dilutions of drugs were added after
2 h, for at least three cell doublings (72–120 h). Drug effects were measured
using the CellTiter 96 AQueous nonradioactive cell proliferation assay
(Promega) and Sulforhodamine B assays (25) and IC50 determined. For
AP23573, growth effects were described as IC30 because rapamycin and its
derivatives do not significantly impede cell proliferation. The nature of drug
interaction was evaluated using the combination index (CI) method of Chou
and Talalay (26) and the software Calcusyn (Biosoft).
Immunoblotting. Cells were treated with various concentrations of
drugs corresponding to synergism. Lysates were extracted in denaturing
lysis buffer, resolved on SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose.
Determination of caspase-mediated cell death. Drug-treated cells
were incubated with CaspACE FITC-VAD-FMK (Promega), according to the
manufacturer’s instructions and counterstained with propidium iodide
(Sigma Aldrich).

AKT kinase assay. Cells were treated with CI-1040, AP23573, or both, in
the presence and absence of the PI3K inhibitor, LY294002. AKT kinase
activity was determined from AKT immunocomplexes by analyzing
phosphorylation of the substrate GSK-3 (Cell Signaling Technology), as
described (27). Alternatively, AKT immunocomplexes were used in an
in vitro kinase assay to catalyze the transfer of g phosphate from [g-32P]
ATP (1 Amol/L Ci/AL) to 200 Amol/L of a specific Akt/SGK peptide (Upstate
USA). Labeled peptides were precipitated, washed, and radioactive
incorporation measured. Baseline values (lysates immunoprecipitated with
immunoglobulin G alone) were subtracted before analysis.
Incorporation of 35S-Methionine. Cells were treated with either
CI-1040 or AP23593, or both for 24 to 72 h. One hour before harvesting,
cells were grown in methionine-free medium (Invitrogen). [35S]methionine
(Amersham Biosciences) was added to a final concentration of 50 ACi/mL
for 30 min. Cell pellets were precipitated, washed with trichloroacetic acid,
and resuspended in 0.5 mol/L NaOH. Protein was transferred to glass
microfiber filters (Whatman) for measurement of [35S]-incorporation.
Linear sucrose gradient fractionation. Ribosomes were obtained after
adding 0.1 mg/mL cycloheximide (Sigma) to drug-treated cells for 3 min
and scraping cells into buffer, as described previously (28). Total ribosomes
were obtained from equal quantities of S-30 proteins. Ribosomes were
loaded onto 15% to 50% sucrose gradients and centrifuged at 39,000 rpm for
90 min at 4jC in a Beckman SW40Ti rotor. Gradient profiles were obtained
by continuous UV monitoring at A254. Alternatively, equal amounts of total
ribosomes (A260) were loaded onto sucrose gradients and centrifuged as
described above.
In vivo drug testing. Human lung cancer xenograft and heterotransplanted tumor models were established in nude mice as described
previously (29) and in compliance with institutional review board
procedures. PD0325901 was formulated from powder as described
previously for CI-1040 (29) and elsewhere (6). Rapamycin was made daily
by diluting the stock solution in ethanol into a vehicle comprising 5%
polyethylene glycol and 5% Tween 80 in saline. The final concentration of
ethanol was 0.03%. Mice bearing tumors of f300 to 600 mm3 (n = 3–5 per
treatment group) were treated daily with either 5 or 20 mg/kg PD0325901
p.o. and 0.5 to 1 mg/kg Rapamycin i.p. For combination treatments, drugs
were given concurrently as 5 mg/kg PD0325901 p.o. with 1 mg/kg
Rapamycin i.p. Control mice received vehicle alone for both drugs. Tumor
volumes and weights were taken weekly and expressed relative to initial
tumor volume. Mice were p.o. rehydrated with saline to relieve
hyperkeratosis and diarrhea.

Results
Concurrent MEK and mTOR inhibition is synergistic in
human NSCLC cell lines. Table 1 summarizes the genotype and
sensitivity of cell lines to MEK and mTOR inhibitors. The BRAFV600E Colo205 cell line was used to compare drug sensitivity
between V600E and non-V600E mutants that are common in
NSCLC. There were three classes of response to MEK inhibition:
hypersensitive (B-RAFV600E mutant Colo205), sensitive (K-RAS
mutant A549 and non-V600E B-RAF mutant NSCLC cell lines),
and resistant (PTEN mutant H157 and p53 mutant H1703). This
trend was more apparent with the highly specific inhibitor
PD0325901, relative to CI-1040. Both H157 and H1703 cells have
constitutively active AKT (CA-AKT), as described previously
(30, 31); however, the underlying mechanism in H1703 has not
been characterized. With the exception of H157, all cell lines had a
comparable level of growth suppression after treatment with the
mTOR inhibitor AP23573.
The combination of MEK and mTOR inhibitors was generally
synergistic in all cell lines evaluated (Table 1 and Supplementary
Fig. S1), except Colo205 that had an additive interaction. The
nature of the interaction was dose dependent. Cells that were
sensitive to MEK inhibition alone (B-RAF mutant NSCLC cell lines

and A549) had a more pronounced synergistic interaction
compared with cell lines that were resistant (H1703 and H157).
B-RAFG466V H1666 cells had a highly synergistic interaction, evident
at very low drug concentrations over a wide range (Supplementary
Fig. S1). H157 and H1703 had variable levels of synergy, although
over a wider dose range, the nature of the interation was generally
additive, reflected in higher mean CI values (Table 1). Synergism
was also observed in A549 for CI-1040 with rapamycin (Supplementary Fig. S1B) and also for the highly specific MEK inhibitor
PD0325901 with either Rapamycin or AP23573 [mean CI (F SD)
over a fractional effect range of 0.2–0.8: PD0325901 with rapamycin,
0.003 (F0.009); PD0325901 with AP23573, 0.004 (F0.008)].
A B-RAFV600E mutant cell line Colo205 was hypersensitive to
MEK-directed therapy, in agreement with Solit et al. (6). This is a
high activity B-RAF mutant that strongly activates ERK signaling
(8). However, combined MEK and mTOR inhibition was additive in
this cell line, presumably due to its hypersensitivity to MEK
inhibition alone. The B-RAFG469A mutant cell lines H1755 and
H1395, also classified as high activity B-RAF mutants, although not
to the same extent as B-RAFV600E, are sensitive to MEK inhibition
and synergize with mTOR inhibitors (Table 1). The B-RAFG466V
mutation present in H1666 cells is an impaired activity mutant
because it activates ERK through heterodimerization with C-RAF
(8) and is defective in directly phosphorylating MEK. H1666 cells
are the only human NSCLC cell line known to contain this
mutation; thus, the widespread effect of the combination in this
genotype could not be evaluated.
Expression of proteins downstream of MEK and mTOR. The
MEK inhibitor CI-1040, either alone or in combination, was
associated with dephosphorylated ERKThr202/Tyr204 (Fig. 1A).
p70S6K is one of the best characterized downstream signaling
components of mTORC1 (32) and exists as 85 and 70 kDa species
corresponding to location in the nucleus and cytoplasm, respectively. AP23573 dephosphorylated p70S6KThr389 in all cell lines
except H1666 that may express a resistant variant of mTORC1.
Decreased p70S6KThr389 phosphorylation by MEK inhibitors has
been noted elsewhere, although under conditions of phorbol 12myristate 13-acetate stimulation using U0126 (23), however, this
was not observed here with CI-1040. Doses of CI-1040 exceeding

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (23). December 1, 2007

10 Amol/L caused diminished expression of total ERK, AKT, and
p70S6K (data not shown). These were nonspecific effects due to
excessively high concentrations of the inhibitor.
Expression of proteins implicated in feedback regulation of
MEK and mTOR. CI-1040 treatment caused increased phosphorylation of MEKSer217/221 in all cell lines analyzed, although in B-RAF
mutant H1666 cells, basal levels were higher and more moderate
changes in MEKSer217/221 phosphorylation were observed. This
suggests that all cell lines undergo feedback activation of RAS in
response to MEK inhibition. CI-1040–induced changes in phosphorylation of MEK at RAS-independent sites, (Thr286 and Ser298)
did not occur.
Full activity of AKT requires phosphorylation at Ser473 and
Thr308 that is mediated by mTORC2 and phosphoinositidedependent kinase 1, respectively (reviewed in ref. 16). CI-1040
and AP23573 both caused increased phosphorylation of pAKTser473
and pAKTThr308 in A549 and H1703 cells (Fig. 1B), consistent with
our previous observations (29). H1666 cells had intrinsically low
expression of Ser473 and Thr308 that was unchanged after CI-1040 or
AP23573 treatment. PTEN mutant H157 cells had high CA-AKT,
and small increases in pAKTser473 and pAKTThr308 phosphorylation
were observed by both CI-1040 or AP23573 but not in combination
treatments (Fig. 1B).
Drug-induced AKT kinase activation. AKT kinase activity also
increased, as shown for A549 (Fig. 1C). CI-1040 induced low-level
AKT activation (f1.4–2-fold) at concentrations associated with
synergy. AP23573 induced AKT kinase activation in A549 cells
(Fig. 1C and D) and in H1703 and H157 cells (data not shown),
consistent with published data that attributes this effect to
feedback regulation by insulin-like growth factor I via IRS1 (27).
Consistent with this, AKT kinase activation by either AP23573 or
CI-1040 was abolished in serum-free conditions (data not shown).
In A549, the combination of both drugs also resulted in AKT kinase
activation.
Both CI-1040– and AP23573-mediated AKT kinase activation
was partially attributable to PI3K because the specific PI3K
inhibitor, LY294002, partially inhibited this effect (Fig. 1D). Low
concentrations of LY294002 were used to prevent the inhibition of
other kinases including mTOR.

MEK and mTOR Inhibition in NSCLC

Concurrent inhibition of MEK and mTOR suppresses proliferation but does not enhance cell death. Doubling time was
determined as a measure of cell proliferation rates (Table 2). Data
for the B-RAFV600E mutant cell line Colo205 is also included.
CI-1040 or AP23573 alone had differential effects, depending on the
genotype of each cell line; however, combined treatment significantly increased doubling time in all cell lines, consistent with
suppression of proliferation. This suggests that the RAS and AKT/
mTOR pathways converge to regulate cellular proliferation through
a highly conserved mechanism because this phenotype was
observed regardless of cellular genotype. Note that for A549 cells,
the effects of the combination were less pronounced relative to the
other cell lines, presumably due to their rapid proliferation rate.
The effect of either CI-1040 or AP23573 on cell cycle distribution,
cyclin D1, and P27/kip-1 varied, depending on the genotype

(Supplementary Fig. S2). The combination of MEK and mTOR
inhibition caused G0-G1 arrest in all cell lines, although suppression
of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) by the combination,
relative to either drug alone, was significant only in A549 and H157
cells. Thus, p27/kip-1, cyclin D1, or PCNA were not universally
prognostic of response to CI-1040, AP23573, or the combination;
however, decreased doubling time and G0-G1 arrest were observed
in all cells treated with the combination.
Cells that were sensitive to MEK inhibition (A549 and H1666)
had caspase-mediated cell death in response to CI-1040 alone
(Fig. 2A); however, this was not potentiated by the addition of an
mTOR inhibitor. Autophagy is a mode of cell death associated with
mTOR suppression; however, there was no enhancement of
autophagic cell death by the addition of CI-1040 (data not shown).
Thus, potentiation of cell death was not a major effect of or

NOTE: Cells were seeded into 24-well plates and treated with CI-1040 and AP23573 alone, and in combination, at doses that resulted in synergism (see
Fig. 2). After approximately three cell doublings, the number of adherent viable cells was determined using a coulter counter. The doubling time (h) was

mechanism for the observed synergy in vitro. This finding is also
substantiated by the doubling time experiments shown in Table 2
because cell number after three doublings was never less than the
initial number of cells seeded, even in combination treatments.
Concurrent inhibition of MEK and mTOR suppresses
protein translation. The 4E-BPs are downstream of mTORC1
and regulate cap-dependent translation by sequestering the
translation initiation factor, eIF4E, via mTORC1-mediated phosphorylation. Three phosphorylated forms of 4E-BP1, g, h, and a, in
order of increasing electrophoretic mobility were resolved (Fig. 2B).
A shift toward the a (hypophosphorylated) form of 4E-BP1
correlates with a reduced level of cap-dependent translation that
permits 4E-BP1 to sequester eIF4E (33). The pattern of 4E-BP1
distribution differed among the four cell lines evaluated and cells
with CA-AKT (H1703 and H157) had the highest expression. A shift
in the phosphorylation state of the protein from g to predominately ah was observed in all cell lines treated with AP23573
(Fig. 2B), except H1666. This was confirmed by decreased phosphorylation of 4E-BP1Ser65/Thr70; an effect that was potentiated by the
CI-1040, especially in A549 and H157 cells, although concomitant
decreases in steady-state levels of 4E-BP1 were also noted.
Ribosomal protein S6 is a substrate of p70S6K and forms part of
the small ribosomal subunit that binds to the 18S rRNA very early
in the assembly pathway leading to the 40S ribosome. In the 80S
ribosome, it is localized at the interface between the subunits in a
region where tRNA and protein factors catalyze mRNA translation
(34). The function of ribosomal protein S6 is unclear, and it was
once thought to regulate the translation of 5¶-TOP mRNAs,
although recently, this has been disproved (35). AP23573 alone
dephosphorylated ribosomal protein S6Ser235/236 in a dose-dependent manner in all cell lines (Fig. 2A). This was enhanced in the
presence of CI-1040, such that phosphorylation of ribosomal
protein S6Ser235/236 was barely detectable in combination-treated
cells, with minimal change in pan ribosomal protein S6 (Fig. 2B).
Together with the effects on 4E-BP1, these data suggest integration
of mTOR and RAS signaling on proteins that regulate protein
translation.
MEK and mTOR inhibition cooperatively suppress polyribosomal synthesis and translation efficiency. To explore the
effect of this drug combination on protein synthesis, drug-treated
A549 cells were metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine
(Fig. 2C). AP23573 suppressed protein synthesis by 30% after

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (23). December 1, 2007

48 h of treatment, similar to what has been reported for rapamycin
(36). CI-1040 also suppressed protein synthesis by f15% after
48 h of treatment. The combination treatment resulted in a more
marked suppression of protein synthesis by 50% after 48 h. This
was also the case in H157 cells, although statistical significance was
only achieved at 48 h, and unlike A549 cells, there was no effect of
either CI-1040 or AP23573, either alone or in combination at 24 h.
Translationally inactive and/or underactive mRNAs are associated
with a single ribosome, termed monosomes, whereas actively
translated transcripts have two or more ribosomes associated with
them and form oligosomes and polysomes. To investigate whether
mRNA translation efficiency is suppressed by the inhibitors, total
ribosomes were isolated from A549 cells. The total yield of ribosomes
recovered for the various drug treatments at 3 and 24 h is summarized
in Table 3. At 3 h, changes in total ribosomes were comparable for
combination and AP23573-treated cells; however, by 24 h, there was a
statistically significant difference in percentage of total ribosomes for
combination treatments (f40%) compared with either CI-1040 or
AP23573 alone. This is in agreement with [35S]methionine incorporation data that also showed a decrease of 40% by 24 h in A549.
Monosomes and polysomes can be readily separated by sucrose
gradient centrifugation, facilitating distinction between poorly and
well-translated mRNAs. A representative experiment is shown in
Fig. 2D that depicts the overall decrease in ribosome levels in
combination-treated cells, as shown in Table 3. Changes in overall
protein translation efficiency are reflected by changes in the
polysome/monosome (P/M) ratio, whereby a redistribution of
ribosomes to smaller oligomers and monosomes is observed. By
3 h, there was a trend for a reduced P/M ratio in combinationtreated cells relative to either MEK or mTOR inhibition alone that
became statistically significant by 24 h.
An alternative representation of the profile for A549 cells is
provided that is normalized to equal amounts of ribosomes
(Supplementary Fig. S3). Here, the relative distribution of polysome
to monosomes is better represented, particularly, the increase in the
monosome peak that is very apparent in combination-treated cells.
This may be indicative of partial inhibition of translation initiation.
Rapamycin potentiated the antitumor efficacy of PD0325901
in animal models of human lung cancer. The effect of
PD0325901, a highly specific MEK inhibitor, and the mTOR
inhibitor, rapamycin, were evaluated in two human NSCLC tumor
xenograft models, A549 and H157 (Fig. 3A), and heterotransplanted

Mutations in B-RAF, KRAS, or NRAS were not detected in tumor
DNA isolated from the tumors shown in three-dimensional;
however, tumor cells were not microdissected, and conventional
sequencing methodologies that are not highly sensitive were used.
PD0325901 and rapamycin have high selectivity for their
respective targets, and importantly, both were available in the
clinic at the time these studies were undertaken. The maximumtolerated dose (MTD) in nude mice of PD0325901 (20 mg/kg qday
p.o.) was also evaluated in heterotransplanted tumor models to
compare the efficacy of the combination with high-dose PD0325901

monotherapy (Fig. 3A). Either drug alone caused varying degrees
of growth suppression in the tumor models tested, except HTL72, where daily low-dose PD0325901 prevented tumor growth for
f30 days. The combination enhanced antitumor efficacy relative
to either dose of PD0325901 or rapamycin in all heterotransplanted lung tumor models tested, except H157. The effect of the
combination was particularly impressive in HTL-72, where tumors
were barely palpable after 60 days of treatment.
HTL-72 was derived from a former smoker. Tumors from these
patients have a high frequency of K-RAS mutation (37). Although
not detected by conventional sequencing, it is plausible that this
tumor was mutant for either RAS or RAF because it had an

for both). Mice were p.o. rehydrated until all mice in the group had
complete resolution of symptoms. The longest lasting symptom
was hyperkeratosis in combination-treatment groups, which
necessitated p.o. rehydration for 3 to 10 days. Close follow-up of
these symptoms in future experiments will be necessary to
determine the underlying cause. Dose and schedule modifications
may also be necessary to obviate the requirement for p.o.
rehydration and further enhance the duration of tumor regression.

Discussion
Despite the genetic heterogeneity of lung cancer, we have shown
that the combination of concurrent low-dose MEK and mTOR
inhibitor therapy was synergistic, consistently suppressed cell
proliferation in all lung cancer cell lines tested, and was associated
with marked dephosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6Ser235/236.
These data substantiate the functional importance of integration
points in signaling networks and, in the case of RAS and AKTregulated translation, suggest that targeting of proteins at
convergence points in signaling networks may be a useful strategy
to circumvent both the emergence of drug resistance and upstream
phamacogenomic variation. This does not preclude the possibility
that tumors with distinct genotypes that are sensitive to MEKinhibition alone (B-RAF or K-RAS mutant) will also have a more
potent synergistic interaction with mTOR inhibitors.
Translation is the RNA-directed synthesis of polypeptides and is
regulated at multiple checkpoints but primarily at initiation where
eIFs recruit ribosomes to mRNA. The role of mTOR in translation
regulation is well-documented (32, 38), but less is known about the
effect of MAPK signaling on translation. The RAS pathway, via
activated ERK, phosphorylates MAPK signal–integrating kinases
(Mnk1 and 2; ref. 39) and p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK; ref. 40) that
directly and indirectly regulate eIF4E, respectively. Cooperation by this
signaling network is further exemplified by the finding that RAS and
AKT converge to phosphorylate eIF4B on Ser422, via RSK activation
and p70S6K (41). eIF4B is an RNA-binding protein that stimulates the
ATPase and helicase activities of eIF4A (42). Furthermore, a recent
study has reported RSK-mediated phosphorylation of ribosomal
protein S6Ser235/236 via a mTOR-independent mechanism, providing a
more prominent role for RAS in the regulation of protein translation,
via the preinitiation complex (43). These data are in excellent
agreement with our results. The effects of MEK and mTOR inhibitors
in the B-RAF mutant cells H1666 are intriguing and suggest a
mTORC1-variant that is resistant to rapamycin-mediated dephosphorylation of 4E-BP1Ser65/Thr70 and p70S6KThr389 but responsive to
alterations of ribosomal protein S6Ser235/236 phosphorylation. It is
plausible that RSK signaling is highly activated in these cells. Further
evidence for this comes from the observation that MEK inhibition by
CI-1040 caused dephosphorylation of 4E-BP1Ser65/Thr70 and ribosomal
protein S6Ser235/236 in these cells.
Mechanistically, we propose a model by which inhibition of
mTORC1, coupled to RSK suppression via MEK inhibition,
synergistically suppresses ribosomal biosynthesis via a defect in
translation initiation. The 43S preinitiation complex that is
required for translation initiation contains ribosomal protein S6,
40S ribosomal subunit, GTP-eIF2-Met-tRNA, eIF3, eIF1, eIF1A, and
eIF5 (44). Ribosomal protein S6Ser235/236 phosphorylation was
reproducibly suppressed by combined MEK and mTOR inhibition
in all cell lines, pointing to a mechanism that perturbs formation of
the preinitiation complex. The primary effect of the changes in

www.aacrjournals.org

translation initiation induced by the combination may be to alter
translation efficiencies of many of the mRNAs that regulate both
ribosomal biogenesis and cellular proliferation.
The growth inhibitory effects of concurrent mTOR and MEK
suppression on proliferation that were consistently observed in cell
lines with different RAS and AKT outputs (Table 2) underscores the
biological importance of S6 ribosomal–mediated translation in
regulating cell growth. These effects are similar to the phenotype
observed in adult mice livers that have a conditionally deleted S6
gene, wherein cells failed to proliferate or induce cyclin E expression
after partial hepatectomy (45). This suggests that the 40S ribosome,
of which S6 is a component, functions as a highly conserved
checkpoint that regulates cell cycle progression. A recent study of
metastatic melanoma spheroids also showed growth arrest when
PI3K and MEK inhibitors were used in combination and not
alone (46). It is plausible that the combination of PI3K and/or
AKT and MEK inhibitors will also be synergistic, although the
mechanism of interaction described here may not apply to other
combinations of MEK inhibitors, and the focus of this study was
to use drugs that are already in the clinic. The in vivo toxicity of
combinations of PI3K, or AKT inhibitors in combination with
MEK inhibitors, is unknown at present. The low doses used in
this study were well-tolerated in mice with manageable toxicities.
Importantly, the in vitro data summarized in Table 1 correctly
predicted the sustained growth suppression observed in several
lung tumor models, including primary lung tumors derived from
patients, except in the PTEN-mutant xenograft model with CAAKT (H157) that had delayed tumor growth but not regression. The
discordance between in vitro and in vivo data for H157 is likely
related to its highly vascularized phenotype and fast proliferation
rate when grown in mice.
One of the major challenges of pharmacogenomic analyses that
use cancer cell lines derived from patients is inherent genetic
heterogeneity. Furthermore, the location and effect of different
gene mutation may change, depending on the tissue type (7). >90%
of B-RAF mutations reported in melanoma involve B-RAFV600E,
whereas most in NSCLC are non-V600. Herein, we confirmed the
sensitivity of B-RAF V600E cells to MEK-directed therapy, as
previously described (6), and we also report that non-V600 B-RAF
mutant lung cell lines have comparable sensitivity to MEK
inhibitors as K-RAS mutants, although one cannot exclude the
possibility that other lung-specific genetic or epigenetic alterations
modulate the oncogenic activity of these mutants. Our data
proposes a therapeutic role for MEK inhibitors in both B-RAF and
K-RAS mutant lung tumors, except in the presence of CA-AKT, as
shown by H1703 and H157.
In signaling networks, inhibition of one axis may be insufficient
because other components compensate. There is concern that such
effects may impede therapeutic efficacy, as shown for rapamycinmediated AKT kinase activation (27). AKT signaling is highly
pleiotropic, yet the drug-induced AKT kinase activation described
herein was not associated with transcriptional activation of the
forkhead transcription factors (data not shown). Despite the strong
AKT kinase activation induced by the combination treatment in
some cells, targets downstream of mTORC1 (4E-BP1, p70S6K, and
S6 ribosomal protein) were suppressed, although it is plausible
that the degree of synergy may be even more pronounced in the
absence of AKT kinase activation. Interestingly, H1666 cells had
no CI-1040– or AP2353-induced change in AKT phosphorylation or
kinase activity (data not shown) and had an extremely strong
synergistic interaction.

Two important paradigms are at the forefront of developing
cancer therapeutics: first, the identification of signaling anomalies
that confer dependence, and second, the appreciation that
oncogenic signaling networks exhibit plasticity and redundancy.
Therefore, rational drug targeting should be focused on proteins
that integrate different components of a network. The mechanistic
rationale for combining targeted therapies is complex, primarily
because the functional relationship between disease, genetics, and
targeted therapies is not well understood. This will require a
greater understanding of the intricacies of feedback regulation and
elucidation of as yet uncharacterized branches of the signaling
network. By exploiting the intricate regulatory elements and
integration points within such networks, we may be able to
overcome the emergence of drug resistance that ensues when only
one component of a network is suppressed and in addition to
