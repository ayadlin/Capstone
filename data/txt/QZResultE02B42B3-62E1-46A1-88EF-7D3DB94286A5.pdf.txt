Abstract
Multiple classes of pharmacologic agents have the potential to induce the expression and release of
proinﬂammatory factors from dying tumor cells. As a result, these cells can in theory elicit an immune response
through various deﬁned mechanisms to permanently eradicate disseminated cancer. However, the impact of
chemotherapy on the tumor-speciﬁc immune response in the context of the tumor microenvironment is largely
unknown. Within the tumor microenvironment, the immune response promoted by chemotherapy is antagonized by an immune-suppressive milieu, and the balance of these opposing forces dictates the clinical course of
disease. Here, we report that high antigen exposure within the tumor microenvironment following chemotherapy
is sufﬁcient to skew this balance in favor of a productive immune response. In elevating antigen exposure,
chemotherapy can achieve long-term control of tumor progression without the need of an additional adjuvant.
We found that chemotherapy initiated this phenomenon in the tumor microenvironment through an accumulation of dendritic cells, which stimulated CD8þ T cells and the type I IFN pathway. From this conceptual base, we
developed a simple approach to cancer therapy combining chemotherapy and vaccination that may be widely
applicable. Cancer Res; 73(8); 2493–504. 2013 AACR.

Introduction
It is now clear that multiple classes of pharmacologic agents
for cancer therapy have the potential to elicit the release of
proinﬂammatory substances from dying tumor cells (1, 2).
These substances are able to induce the maturation of dendritic cells and the subsequent activation of tumor-speciﬁc
CD8þ CTLs. Indeed, it has been shown that, when pretreated
with chemotherapy, tumor cells can evoke a robust adaptive
immune response upon transfer into mice (1, 2). Furthermore,
these mice efﬁciently reject secondary tumor challenge (1, 2).
Several reports over recent years have revealed that the
mechanisms underlying the inﬂammatory effects of chemoAuthors' Afﬁliations: Departments of 1Pathology, 2Obstetrics and Gynecology, 3Molecular Microbiology and Immunology, and 4Oncology, Johns

therapy are numerous and diverse, involving for example
activation of the NLRP3 inﬂammasome (3), surface translocation of calreticulin (4), autophagy and ATP release (5), instigation of the endoplasmic reticulum stress response (6),
caspase activation (7), or secretion of HMGB1 (8).
The immune response produced by tumor cells mixed with
chemotherapy—together with our knowledge of the molecular
mechanisms underlying this process—has fueled much of the
enthusiasm for combining chemotherapy with immune-based
therapy (9). The rationale for this dual approach is that
chemotherapy—a mainstay intervention for cancer since the
1940s—has the potential to debulk the primary tumor mass,
whereas immune-based therapy has the potential to eradicate
disseminated disease and to prevent relapse. Thus, this dual
approach represents a synergistic strategy that capitalizes on
the strengths of each therapy while circumventing its major
weaknesses. Furthermore, it is well established that chemotherapy can induce an inﬂammatory state in tumor cells (1, 2)
and the effects of chemotherapy on the tumor microenvironment in the context of the host immune response are becoming
better understood (10–13). While chemotherapy would in
theory elicit the release of proinﬂammatory substances from
cancer cells in such a microenvironment, the tumor milieu also
contains a host of elements that dampen the antitumor
immune response, such as suppressive cytokine networks,
immune checkpoints, and regulatory subsets of cells (14).
These elements are largely responsible for the failure of
immune-based therapy in the clinic. Therefore, in order for
a dual approach combining chemotherapy and immune-based

therapy to be successful for patients with cancer, chemotherapy must be able to overcome the obstacles to immune-based
therapy posed by the tumor microenvironment. The purpose of
the current study is thus to characterize the effects of chemotherapy on the immune response within the tumor microenvironment and to uncover the mechanisms responsible for
these effects.
We found that chemotherapy converts the tumor into a site
permissive for the activation of an adaptive immune response
within the tumor. Notably, this immune response can be
produced with a vaccination-lacking adjuvant, which represents a marked advantage over other types of immune-based
therapy. Also, we found that this immune response is driven by
the accumulation of dendritic cells in the tumor, followed by
their maturation, migration to lymph nodes, and priming of
tumor-speciﬁc CD8þ CTLs in a type I IFN-dependent manner.
Our data further indicate that antigen density within the tumor
is an important determinant of the outcome of immune
surveillance following chemotherapy. With this concept, we
create an effective, universally applicable strategy for cancer
therapy based on systemic antigen delivery to the tumor.

Materials and Methods
Mice
Six- to 8-week-old female C57BL/6 or BALB/c mice were
obtained from the National Cancer Institute. Toll-like receptor
4 (TLR4) knockout mice were from the Jackson Laboratory, and
IFN-a receptor (IFNAR) knockout mice were a kind gift from
Dr. G. Cheng laboratory (University of California, Los Angeles,
Los Angeles, CA). All animal procedures were carried out under
protocols approved by the Johns Hopkins Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee and in accordance with recommendations for the proper use and care of laboratory animals.
Cells
The TC-1 tumor model was generated by transformation of
primary lung epithelial cells from C57BL/6 mice with active Ras
together with HPV-16 E6 and E7 oncogenes and the production
and maintenance of this cell line has been described previously
(15). TC-1 cells were subjected to RapidMAP (Taconic Farms)
testing, a panel of PCR tests for rodent viruses, most recently in
May 2011 with negative results. CT26 colon carcinoma cells
were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection cell
bank, which characterized the cell line for Mycoplasma by the
Hoescht stain, PCR, and the standard culture test, all of which
had negative results. Cells were cultured at 37 C with 5% CO2 in
RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mmol/L Lglutamine, 1 mmol/L sodium pyruvate, 2 mmol/L nonessential
amino acids, and 50 U/mL penicillin/streptomycin.
Tumor treatment experiments
TC-1 or CT26 tumor cells (105 per animal) were inoculated
subcutaneously into C57BL/6 or BALB/c mice (10 per group),
respectively. Five days later, tumor-bearing mice were treated
intratumorally with 20 mg of E7 peptide (aa42-63) or AH1-A5
(SPSYAYHQF), or 50 mg of TA-CIN recombinant protein or
isotonic saline control, in conjunction with intraperitoneal
cisplatin (5 mg/kg body weight) or saline control. For systemic

targeted peptide delivery, mice were treated by tail vein
with 200 mg of FITC-CNGRC, FITC-GGGGG, E7 (aa42-63), or
CNGRC-E7 peptide, together with intraperitoneal cisplatin (5
mg/kg) or saline control. Mice were monitored for evidence of
tumor growth by visual inspection and palpation twice each
week. To assess tumor burden in the lung hematogenous
spread model, C57BL/6 mice were each inoculated subcutaneously with 105 TC-1 cells and treated as described earlier.
Each mouse was then inoculated intravenously with 105 TC-1
cells on day 9. The number of pulmonary tumor nodules was
counted on day 30. For in vivo experiments with other pharmacologic agents, we used the following doses per injection of
each type of chemotherapy: carboplatin (50 mg/kg), doxorubicin (10 mg/kg), and cyclophosphamide (20 mg/kg).
Surface tetramer, intracellular cytokine staining, and
ﬂow cytometry
C57BL/6 mice were administered with cisplatin (5 mg/kg) or
saline control in conjunction with 20 mg of E7 peptide (aa4362), 50 mg of TA-CIN, 20 mg of CNGRC-E7 peptide, 20 mg of short
Ova peptide (aa257-264), 20 mg of long Ova peptide (aa241-270),
50 mg of Ova protein, or saline control. Mice were boosted twice
at the same dose and regimen at 3-day intervals. For tetramer
staining, blood and tumor tissue was harvested 1 week after the
last peptide or protein injection. Phycoerythrin (PE)-labeled H2Db tetramers containing HPV-16 E7 49-57 peptide (RAHYNIVTF; Beckman Coulter) were used for the analysis of E7speciﬁc CD8þ T cells by ﬂow cytometry (16). For intracellular
cytokine staining, splenocytes were harvested 1 week after the
last peptide or protein injection. Before intracellular cytokine
staining, 6  105 pooled splenocytes from each vaccination
group were incubated with 1 mg/mL E7 peptide (aa49-57), AH1
peptide (SPSYVYHQF), or Ova peptide (SIINFEKL), together
with GolgiPlug (1,000; BD Biosciences) for 16 hours. Cells
were then harvested and mixed with monoclonal antibodies
against CD8 and IFN-g as we previously described (17). Samples were acquired on a FACSCalibur device using CellQuest
Pro software (BD Biosciences). All analyses were conducted on
gated lymphocyte populations.
In vivo antibody depletion experiments
C57BL/6 mice (5 per group) were inoculated subcutaneously with 105 TC-1 cells per animal and treated with
cisplatin (5 mg/kg) and E7 peptide (20 mg) according to the
regimen described earlier. Depletion was initiated 1 day
before injection of cisplatin and peptide and ended on day
30 after tumor challenge. The following antibody clones were
used: CD4 (GK1.5), CD8 (2.43), and NK1.1 (PK136). Immunoglobulin G (IgG) was used as an isotype control.
Analysis of tumor-inﬁltrating populations
To detect tumor-inﬁltrating CD11cþ dendritic cells, C57BL/
6 mice (3 per group) were inoculated subcutaneously with 105
TC-1 cells per animal. On day 5, mice were treated intraperitoneally with cisplatin (5 mg/kg) or saline control twice at 3day intervals. One day after the last injection, tumor tissue was
excised from mice, mechanically disrupted into fragments in
PBS, washed twice, and digested with 500 U/mL dispase (Godo

Shusei) at 37 C for 20 minutes. Tissue fragments were resuspended in 5 mL of PBS and mixed extensively with a Pasteur
pipette to obtain single cells. The cells were then passed
through a stainless wire sieve (100 mesh) and washed twice
with PBS. Sedimented cells were resuspended in PBS and
stained with PE-labeled anti-CD11c monoclonal antibody (BD
Pharmingen). To detect migration of CD11cþ dendritic cells
into lymph nodes, TC-1 tumor-bearing mice were treated with
or without cisplatin as described earlier and administered
intratumorally with 20 mg of ﬂuorescein isothiocyanate
(FITC)-labeled E7 peptide, with or without 100 nmol/L (4S)(3-[(3R,S)-3-cyclohexyl-3-hydroxypropyl]-2,5-dioxo)-4-imidazolidineheptanoic acid (BW245C), a migration inhibitor. After
48 hours, draining lymph nodes were harvested and homogenized in RPMI-10 using nylon mesh bags. Erythrocytes were
lysed using ammonium chloride, and the remaining cells were
washed twice with RPMI-10. Cells were stained with PE-labeled
anti-CD11c antibody and allophycocyanin-labeled anti-CD40,
-CD80, or -CD86 antibody (BD Pharmingen). To detect tumorinﬁltrating T cells, C57BL/6 (3 per group) were inoculated with
tumor and treated with cisplatin and/or intratumoral E7
peptide as described earlier. On day 7, tumor tissue was excised
and processed as described earlier. Tumor-inﬁltrating T cells
were stained with FITC-labeled anti-CD8 and PE-labeled E7
tetramer and analyzed by ﬂow cytometry.
T-cell activation experiments
C57BL/6 mice (3 per group) were inoculated subcutaneously
with 105 TC-1 cells per animal. On day 5, mice were treated with
cisplatin and/or intratumoral E7 peptide (40 mg), with or
without 100 nmol/L BW245C. After 48 hours, draining or
nondraining lymph nodes were harvested and single cells were
prepared as described earlier. CD11cþ cells were isolated with
magnetic beads (Miltenyi Biotec). A total of 2  105 CD11cþ
dendritic cells were incubated with E7-speciﬁc CD8þ T cells
overnight at a 1:1 ratio. The frequency of IFN-g–secreting E7speciﬁc CD8þ T cells was determined by ﬂow cytometry.
ELISA
C57BL/6 mice (5 per group) were inoculated subcutaneously with 105 TC-1 cells per animal. On day 5, mice were
treated with cisplatin and/or intratumoral E7 peptide as
described earlier. On day 7, 10, and 14 after tumor challenge,
tumor tissue was excised and processed into single cells as
described earlier. Cells were lysed using Protein Extraction
Solution radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA; Pierce),
and protein concentration was measured by Coomassie Plus
protein assay (Pierce). ELISA was conducted to quantify
levels of Mcp-1 and IFN-b according to the manufacturer's
protocol (R&D Systems). All cytokine amounts were normalized to total protein concentration.
Statistical analysis
The data presented in this study are representative of 3
independent experiments and are expressed as mean  SD.
The number of samples in each group for any given experiment
was greater than 3. Results for ﬂow cytometry analysis and
tumor treatment experiments were evaluated by one-way

ANOVA and the Tukey–Kramer test. Individual data points
were compared using Student t test. The event-time distributions for different mice were compared using the Kaplan–
Meier method and the log-rank test. All P values less than 0.05
were considered signiﬁcant.

Results
Chemotherapy with high antigen exposure efﬁciently
controls tumor growth
We ﬁrst assessed the inﬂuence of antigen exposure in the
tumor microenvironment on the tumor-speciﬁc immune
response after chemotherapy. We inoculated C57BL/6 mice
with TC-1 tumor cells, which contain the E7 oncogene from
human papillomavirus (HPV) type 16 (15), and then treated
the mice with various combinations of the platinum-based
chemotherapy cisplatin, administered into the peritoneal
cavity, together with long E7 peptide (aa 42-63) containing
H2-Db–restricted E7 epitope (aa 49-57) administered either
directly into the tumor or into subcutaneous tissue (Fig.
1A). Bitherapy with cisplatin and intratumoral E7 peptide
virtually cured TC-1–bearing mice, whereas monotherapy
with either of these reagents led to rapid tumor progression
and death (Fig. 1B–D). Cisplatin therapy with subcutaneous
E7 injection failed to control tumor growth (Fig. 1B–D),
indicating that priming of the tumor-speciﬁc immune
response after chemotherapy occurred only with peptide
delivery into the tumor microenvironment. Although the
group of tumor-bearing mice treated with intratumoral
antigenic peptide following cisplatin remained tumor-free
26 days after tumor challenge, eventually 70% of the tumorbearing mice in this treatment group developed tumors
again 70 days after tumor challenge as shown in Fig. 1D.
Furthermore, cisplatin and intratumoral E7 bitherapy
almost completely protected mice from development of
pulmonary tumor nodules in a hematogenous spread model, whereas monotherapy had only a mild protective effect
(Fig. 1E). Similar results were observed with DNA intercalating agents other than cisplatin (Fig. 1F and G). We
conclude that chemotherapy converts the tumor into a
microenvironment capable of instigating and sustaining
both a productive local and systemic tumor-speciﬁc
immune response after adjuvant-free peptide vaccination.
Tumor control by chemotherapy and high antigen
exposure is mediated through CD8þ CTLs
To characterize this tumor-speciﬁc immune response, we
depleted CD4þ or CD8þ T cells or natural killer (NK) cells in
TC-1–bearing mice with monoclonal antibodies and then
treated the mice with cisplatin and intratumoral E7 bitherapy. Although elimination of CD4þ T cells and NK cells had
no effect on tumor growth (data not shown), depletion of
CD8þ T cells abolished tumor control by the combined
regimen (Fig. 2A). There were a large number of E7-speciﬁc
CD8þ T cells in the tumors of TC-1–bearing mice treated
with this regimen (nearly 40% of total CD8þ T cells); in
contrast, E7-speciﬁc CD8þ T cells were barely detectable
among groups of tumor-bearing mice treated either with
monotherapy (with cisplatin or intratumoral E7) or with

cisplatin and subcutaneous E7 bitherapy (Fig. 2B). Similar
results were observed in the blood (Fig. 2C) and in the spleen
(Fig. 2D), as well as for different types of chemotherapy
(Fig. 2E). Thus, we conclude that the local and systemic
antitumor effect elicited by chemotherapy, in the context of
high antigen density within the tumor, is mediated by CD8þ
CTLs.
To extend the translational value of this methodology, we
similarly treated TC-1–bearing mice with cisplatin together
with intratumoral injection of a clinical-grade recombinant E6,
E7, and L2 fusion protein (TA-CIN). Cisplatin and intratumoral
TA-CIN bitherapy elicited a robust E7-speciﬁc CTL-mediated
immune response and led to tumor eradication and complete
long-term survival (Supplementary Fig. S1A–S1C). Unlike peptide-based vaccination, which has limited potential due to
MHC restriction, protein-based vaccination can be applied to
individuals with different MHC genetic backgrounds. Furthermore, comparable results were observed in a distinct antigen
system, ovalbumin, with either intratumoral peptide or protein
injection (Supplementary Fig. S1D and S1E). These data suggest that nontumor-associated antigens can also elicit a potent
antigen-speciﬁc T-cell immune response resulting in an appreciable therapeutic antitumor effect.

Chemotherapy induces activation and migration of
antigen-loaded dendritic cells into tumor-draining
lymph nodes
We next examined the mechanisms by which chemotherapy
facilitates development of an adaptive immune response within the tumor microenvironment after adjuvant-free peptide
vaccination. We found that following delivery of cisplatin, there
was a 10-fold accumulation of CD11cþ dendritic cells in tumor
tissue (to 30% of total cells in the tumor; Fig. 3A). To trace the
destination and phenotype of these dendritic cells, we coadministered cisplatin and FITC-labeled long E7 peptide (aa 4263) into the tumor. We then isolated the tumor-draining lymph
nodes and assessed the frequency of FITCþ dendritic cells. The
amount of FITCþ dendritic cells was ampliﬁed over 10-fold in
lymph nodes from mice administered with cisplatin compared
with isotonic saline control, and codelivery of the prostaglandin analog BW245C, which inhibits migration of dendritic cells,
abrogated this effect (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, FITCþ dendritic
cells had higher mean expression of the costimulatory molecules CD40, CD80, and CD86 relative to FITC dendritic cells
(Fig. 3C). We found that dendritic cells isolated from mice
treated with intratumoral E7 in conjunction with cisplatin
activated E7-speciﬁc CTLs over 15 times more strongly than

dendritic cells from mice administered with intratumoral E7
alone, but this effect was lost with coinjection of BW245C (Fig.
3D). In addition, E7-speciﬁc CTLs failed to become activated
when mixed with dendritic cells from lymph nodes of mice
treated with cisplatin alone, showing that the density of E7
antigen within the endogenous TC-1 tumor microenvironment
is insufﬁcient for development of a tumor-speciﬁc adaptive
immune response (Fig. 3D). These data indicate that chemotherapy enriches dendritic cells in the tumor microenvironment; these dendritic cells have the capacity to uptake tumor
antigen, whereupon they mature, travel to the draining lymph
nodes, and prime tumor-speciﬁc CTLs.
The type I IFN and TLR4 signaling axes are required for
the tumor-speciﬁc immune response elicited by
chemotherapy
We next explored the molecular signaling axes underlying
the priming of an adaptive immune response in the tumor
microenvironment after chemotherapy. We found that for over
2 weeks after cisplatin injection, there was a greater than 10-

www.aacrjournals.org

fold rise in the tumor in the concentration of the chemokine
Ccl2 (Mcp-1), which has a major function in recruiting dendritic cells to inﬂammatory sites (Fig. 4A). Furthermore, the
levels of IFN-b in the tumor were also persistently elevated over
10-fold after cisplatin injection (Fig. 4B), suggesting a role for
the type I IFN pathway in the immune-modulating effect of
chemotherapy. In support of this, dendritic cells from transgenic mice deﬁcient in IFNAR failed to uptake FITC-labeled E7
peptide and move into draining lymph nodes after cisplatin
and intratumoral E7 injection (Fig. 4C). IFNAR/ mice also
mounted a systemic immune response 5 times weaker than
wild-type littermates, after cisplatin and intratumoral E7
bitherapy (Fig. 4D), which correlated with lack of tumor control
(Fig. 4E) and reduced survival (Fig. 4F). We conducted parallel
experiments in TLR4-deﬁcient mice and found the effectiveness of cisplatin and intratumoral E7 bitherapy to also depend
on the TLR4 pathway (Fig. 5A–D), as has been previously
suggested (8). Tumor cells are likely a direct source for triggering this pathway in dendritic cells as TC-1 cells treated with
cisplatin release a large amount of the TLR4 ligand HMGB1

(Supplementary Fig. S2). We conclude that the type I IFN and
TLR4 axes mediate the immune-modulating effect of chemotherapy in the tumor microenvironment. It will be important to
further elucidate the precise relationship between the type I
IFN and TLR4 axes as it relates to this effect.
Chemotherapy enables vaccine adjuvant-free priming of
a tumor-speciﬁc immune response against self-tumor
antigen
To extend our study outside the realm of viral-associated
cancer—which presents a straightforward target for immune
control due to the expression of foreign tumor antigen—we
adopted the CT26 model of colon cancer, which was derived by
chemical carcinogenesis (18). The epitope AH1-A5 of gp70 has
previously been identiﬁed as a self-antigen in the CT26 model
capable of expanding tumor-reactive CTLs (19). Thus, we
treated CT26-bearing mice with cisplatin together with intratumoral AH1-A5 peptide (Fig. 6A). This combined regimen led

2498

Cancer Res; 73(8) April 15, 2013

to sustained, stable control of disease (Fig. 6B), prolonged
survival of mice (Fig. 6C), and a higher frequency of AH1-A5–
speciﬁc CTLs (Fig. 6D) compared with either monotherapy
(with cisplatin or intratumoral AH1-A5) or bitherapy with
cisplatin and subcutaneous AH1-A5. We conclude that chemotherapy supports the priming of an adaptive immune
response within the tumor against foreign as well as self-tumor
antigen. Thus, the immune-based therapy described here
represents a universal approach, which may be effective
against a wide spectrum of cancer types.
Chemotherapy together with targeted systemic delivery
of antigen to the tumor is an effective approach to
control cancer
Because downregulation or loss of tumor antigen is a
prevalent—and sometimes predominant—mode of tumor
immune escape (20), the delivery of exogenous antigen into
the tumor microenvironment may be a requirement in the

clinical setting. However, intratumoral injection is often
impractical as a means of antigen delivery, particularly in the
context of disseminated cancer or a tumor embedded deeply
within solid tissue. To overcome this hurdle, we used the CD13binding peptide CNGRC to target antigen to tumor tissue after
systemic injection. CD13 is an aminopeptidase abundantly
present on the surface of tumor endothelial cells, and thus
represents a suitable target for antigen delivery to the tumor
(21, 22). After intravenous injection of FITC-labeled CNGRC
peptide into TC-1–bearing mice, more than 5% of cells harvested from tumor tissue were FITCþ (compared with only
0.1% of cells from tumor of mice administered with FITClabeled GGGGG control peptide; Fig. 7A); of these FITCþ cells,
more than 15% were CD11cþ dendritic cells (Fig. 7B). Furthermore, tumor-inﬁltrating CD11cþ dendritic cells isolated
from mice administered by intravenous route with CNGRCconjugated E7 peptide had 5 times greater capacity to activate
E7-speciﬁc CTLs compared with those from mice administered
with unconjugated E7 peptide (Fig. 7C). Combined delivery of
cisplatin and intravenous CNGRC-E7 also led to strong inhibition of tumor growth and control of disease in TC-1–bearing
mice (Fig. 7D–F). Notably, mice administered CNGRC-E7 alone
had identical tumor growth kinetics as those administered
saline control (Fig. 7D–F), indicating that high antigen exposure in the tumor is by itself incapable of producing a potent
tumor-speciﬁc immune response. Indeed, mice administered

www.aacrjournals.org

with cisplatin together with CNGRC-E7 had much a greater
systemic E7-speciﬁc CTL-mediated immune response than
mice administered with either agent alone (Fig. 7G and H).
Thus, we have provided a proof-of-principle demonstration
that the therapy developed here can be readily and conveniently applied to the clinical management of a wide variety of
human cancer types.
In summary, our study reveals for the ﬁrst time that the
tumor microenvironment is converted by chemotherapy into a
site permissive for vaccination to elicit a local and systemic
immune response without the need for additional adjuvant.
This immune response is driven by the accumulation of
dendritic cells in the tumor, followed by their maturation,
migration to lymph nodes, and priming of tumor-speciﬁc
CD8þ CTLs in a type I IFN-dependent manner. Our data further
indicate that antigen density within the tumor is an important
determinant of the outcome of immune surveillance following
chemotherapy. These ﬁndings have signiﬁcant clinical implications and introduce a new direction for the development of
immune-based therapy for cancer.

Discussion
In this study, we have shown that a broad range of pharmacologic agents for cancer therapy fundamentally alters the
tumor microenvironment into a site that permits a productive
tumor-speciﬁc local and systemic immune response. These

results show that while the tumor might predominately exist in
an immune-suppressive state, this state is highly dynamic and
can be reversed by pharmacologic intervention. Thus, our data
provide impetus for the development and clinical translation of
novel immune-based strategies for cancer therapy.
We found that antigen delivery into the tumor in the context
of chemotherapy was sufﬁcient to generate a strong antigenspeciﬁc CD8þ CTL immune response, which led to effective
and persistent control of local and disseminated disease.
Notably, our approach applies broadly regardless of the type
of antigen (peptide or protein) or the class of chemotherapy.
Furthermore, the approach can be extended to antigens not
directly associated with the tumor. For example, we observed
that intratumoral injection with foreign peptide (Ova) led to
the generation of Ova-speciﬁc CD8þ T cells as well as therapeutic antitumor effects against non-Ova–expressing tumors
(Supplementary Fig. S1).
Several potential mechanisms may account for the observed
antitumor therapeutic effects generated by the intratumoral
injection of Ova. For example, the uptake of Ova by tumor
stromal cells, such as CD11bþ myeloid derived cells, may lead
to the processing and presentation of Ova peptide through the

2500

Cancer Res; 73(8) April 15, 2013

class I MHC pathway, rendering CD11bþ myeloid cells susceptible to Ova-speciﬁc CD8þ T-cell–mediated killing. Zhang
and colleagues previously observed that treatment of tumors
with a chemotherapeutic drug could lead to the loading of
CD11bþ tumor stromal cells with tumor-speciﬁc peptide presented by MHC class I molecules (23). Thus, our study is
consistent with Zhang and colleagues' study in that the
CD11bþ tumor stromal cells are capable of processing and
presenting the antigenic peptide making them sensitized for Tcell–mediated killing. In addition, the antitumor effect generated by our approach may lead to the release of tumor antigen,
such as E7 in TC-1 tumors, resulting in enhanced cross-priming
of CD8þ T cells reactive against intrinsic E7. Thus, the antitumor effect observed following the intratumoral injection of
antigen, such as Ova, may be accounted for by different
mechanisms.
In addition to being effective using a variety of antigens, our
approach does not require administration of exogenous adjuvants beyond chemotherapy. The vast majority of vaccination
regimens for cancer or infectious disease rely on adjuvants to
create a potent immune response. However, very few adjuvants
have been approved for clinical use, and the administration of

adjuvants carries intrinsic risks of substantial side effects.
Thus, our study has important translational value. From a
scientiﬁc point of view, the ability of chemotherapy to elicit an
adaptive immune response within the tumor in the absence of
vaccine adjuvants indicates that the tumor microenvironment
is an ideal site for the priming of CTLs. Notably, delivery of
antigen into subcutaneous tissue—the most common vaccination site—without adjuvants did not elicit a detectable
immune response. This discovery challenges the prevailing
notion of the tumor as an inherently immune-suppressive site
and underscores the dynamic nature of interactions between
the tumor and the immune system. We posit a model in which
the tumor is at equilibrium in an immune-suppressive state
imposed by an inhibitory cytokine milieu, an extensive checkpoint network, and an abundance of regulatory immune cells.
This immune-suppressive state is opposed by a variety of

www.aacrjournals.org

components, including proinﬂammatory factors, stimulatory
immune cells, and effector CTLs. Our study reveals that
chemotherapy shifts this balance of forces in favor of an
immune-supportive state within the tumor.
In the current study, we have observed the accumulation of
CD11cþ dendritic cells in the tumor after treatment with
cisplatin, which led to enhanced activation of antigen-speciﬁc
CD8þ T cells subsequent to intratumoral injection of antigen.
We have explored several factors that may contribute to the
observed phenomenon. We observed that MCP-1 (CCL2) was
upregulated following chemotherapy (Fig. 4A). MCP-1 was
previously shown to be closely related to the migration of
dendritic cells (24, 25). Thus, the upregulation of MCP-1 may
account for the accumulation of CD11cþ dendritic cells in
tumor loci, although we cannot exclude the contribution of
other molecules to this process.

In the current study, we focused on the TLR4 and type I IFN
activation pathways for the generation of antigen-speciﬁc
CD8þ T cells. It has previously been shown that the anticancer
immune response induced by chemotherapy is dependent on
the contribution of TLR4 and involves HMGB-1 action on TLR4
(8). We have observed that tumor cell treatment with cisplatin
can lead to the release of HMGB1 (see Supplementary Fig. S2).
The release of HMGB1 is likely important for the activation of
the TLR4 pathway. Previously, it has been shown that the type I
IFN pathway is involved in the maturation and migration of
dendritic cells and T-cell priming (26). Consequently, we
focused on the type I IFN pathway. We have observed that

2502

Cancer Res; 73(8) April 15, 2013

the activation of both the type I IFN and TLR4 pathways is
important for the generation of antigen-speciﬁc CD8þ T cells.
By examining the inﬂuence of Mcp-1 along with the TLR4
and type I IFN pathways, we have identiﬁed a potential
mechanism through which the immune-supportive state is
established in the tumor. In particular, chemotherapy induces
the inﬁltration of dendritic cells into the tumor. Upon encounter with antigen, these dendritic cells undergo activation and
migration to draining lymph nodes where they stimulate
tumor-speciﬁc CTLs. The inﬁltration of dendritic cells into
the tumor is most likely mediated by the chemokine Mcp-1, as
we observed elevated levels of this chemokine in the tumor

Chemotherapy Converts Tumor Microenvironment

following chemotherapy. Furthermore, the maturation of dendritic cells and their migration to lymph nodes is dependent on
the type I IFN pathway, as: (i) IFN-b levels were increased in the
tumor after chemotherapy, and (ii) IFNAR-deﬁcient mice
exhibit defective migration of antigen-loaded dendritic cells
into tumor-draining lymph nodes, as well as severely compromised immune response and antitumor effects following vaccination. The release of type I IFN in dendritic cells is most
likely triggered through the TLR4 pathway, as the immunestimulatory effects of chemotherapy are abolished in TLR4deﬁcient mice. Notably, tumor cells treated with chemotherapy release high levels of HMGB1, a ligand for TLR4. Taken
together, one possible scenario underlying the immune-stimulatory effects of chemotherapy on the tumor microenvironment is: (i) chemotherapy causes tumor cells to release
HMGB1, (ii) HMGB1 binds to TLR4 on resident dendritic cells
and causes them to secrete Mcp-1 and type I IFN, (iii) Mcp-1
attracts a large number of dendritic cells into the tumor,
whereas type I IFN induces their maturation and migration
into draining lymph nodes, and (iv) antigen-loaded dendritic
cells stimulate cognate CTLs to attack the tumor. Apparently,
there are other potential pathways and/or sequences that may
contribute to the observed phenomena in our study. In addition, we observed that chemotherapy also reduces the number
of systemic myeloid-derived suppressor cells in tumor-bearing
mice (Supplementary Fig. S3) and shifts the macrophage
population in the tumor toward a stimulatory M1 phenotype
(Supplementary Fig. S4).
This model also explains our observation that antigen
density within the tumor is an important determinant of the
immune response and clinical outcome. Consistent with this
idea, we found that within the lymph nodes, dendritic cells
loaded with tumor antigen had higher activation status than
dendritic cells without antigen. Thus, we conclude that a
precondition for a successful outcome for any immunebased therapy following chemotherapy is sufﬁcient antigen
exposure within the tumor. With this concept, we have
developed a new approach to immune-based therapy based
on targeted antigen delivery into the tumor in conjunction
with chemotherapy (see Fig. 7). This approach is especially

powerful because it can be used conveniently to control
antigen density within the tumor. We envision that such a
technology could be widely implemented with either peptide
or protein antigen. Furthermore, this technology could in
principle be readily applied to any tumor type with deﬁned
antigen. In a case in which the tumor does not possess any
such deﬁned antigen, we propose that a foreign antigen—for
example, a viral antigen that many individuals have preexisting memory CTLs against—may instead be targeted to the
tumor. We therefore believe that this approach may warrant
future clinical translation.
