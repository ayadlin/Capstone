ABSTRACT
Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and tumor associated macrophages
(TAMs) play key roles in the tumor immune suppressive network and tumor
progression. However, precise roles of programmed death-1 (PD-1) in immunological
functions of MDSCs and TAMs in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC)
have not been clearly elucidated. In the present study, we show that PD-1 and
PD-L1 levels were significantly higher in human HNSCC specimen than in normal oral
mucosa. MDSCs and TAMs were characterized in mice and human HNSCC specimen,
correlated well with PD-1 and PD-L1 expression. aPD-1 treatment was well tolerated
and significantly reduced tumor growth in the HNSCC mouse model along with
significant reduction in MDSCs and TAMs in immune organs and tumors. Molecular
analysis suggests a reduction in the CD47/SIRPa pathway by PD-1 blockade, which
regulates MDSCs, TAMs, dendritic cell as well as effector T cells. Hence, these data
identify that PD-1/PD-L1 axis is significantly increased in human and mouse HNSCC.
Adoptive aPD-1 immunotherapy may provide a novel therapeutic approach to modulate
the micro- and macro- environment in HNSCC.

been made in targeted therapies, HNSCC recurrence,
resistance to chemo-radiotherapy and cervical lymph node
metastasis persist as the most important factors affecting
the poor prognosis of patients, particularly in refractory
HPV-negative HNSCC. Therefore identification and
characterization of the molecular mechanisms underlying
HNSCC initiation and progression are a priori for timely
diagnosis and developing effective treatment.
Various mechanisms have been proposed for
the resistance of HNSCC to immune recognition and
response, including recruitment of myeloid derived
suppressor cells (MDSCs), tumor associated macrophages
(TAMs), regulatory T cells (Tregs), and local secretion
of “alternatively activated” immunosuppressive soluble

INTRODUCTION
Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC),
with more than 450,000 newly diagnosed cases every
year, is the 6th most common cancer worldwide [1].
As the oral cavity is the most frequent site (~90%)
affected in HNSCC, it impacts highly critical functions
of respiration, swallowing food and water as well as
speech [2]. In developing countries, the tobacco-related
human papillomavirus (HPV)-negative HNSCC has more
morbidity and mortality than HPV-positive HNSCC [3].
HPV-negative HNSCC is usually accompanied by
mutations of p53 and loss of expression of PTEN [3, 4].
Although in recent years significant advances have

increased CD274 (gene encoding PD-L1) and CD279
(gene encoding PD-1) DNA copy number, as well
as increased mRNA expression of this genes, was
significantly increased in HNSCC as compared with the
controls (P < 0.05, Fig. S1A–S1C). To evaluate PD-1/
PD-L1 levels in human HNSCC tissues, we performed
immunohistochemistry in human HNSCC sections
(Fig. 1A). PD-1 immunostaining revealed elevated levels
in inflammatory cells of the cancerous tissue, and in
particular in the invasive front of the tumor (Fig. 1A).
PD-L1 immunostaining displayed its predominant
expression in membrane and cytoplasm of HNSCC cells.
There was significantly increased immunostaining for
PD-1/PD-L1 in human HNSCC (n = 86) as compared
with dysplasia (n = 12) and normal oral mucosa (n = 32)
(Fig. 1B).

factors such as TGFβ1, IL10 and IL13 [5]. Recent
advances in therapeutic antibodies, cancer vaccines, and
adoptive T-cell therapy (ACT) have shown promising
therapeutic potential of immunotherapy in treating patients
with cancer [6]. Tumor-mediated immunosuppression is
also considered to be a major barrier for successful cancer
immunotherapy. Recent evidence has suggested that
tumor-mediated immunosuppression by the up-regulation
of coinhibitory immune checkpoints such as programmed
death 1 (PD-1) and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen
4 (CTLA-4) represent major obstacles to the generation
and maintenance of clinically meaningful antitumor
immunity [7, 8].
PD-L1 (a principal ligand of PD-1), known to
be expressed by cells in the tumor microenvironment,
engages PD-1 on T cells and subsequently triggers
inhibitory signaling, downstream of the T-cell receptor,
blocking effector functions and reducing the T-cell killing
capacity [9]. PD-L1 can be constitutively expressed on
the surface of cancer cells through poorly characterized
oncogenic signaling pathways [10, 11]. PD-L1 is also
expressed in immune cells in response to the presence of
immune-stimulating cytokines [12]. The important role
of PD-1/PD-L1 axis in the tumor immunosuppressive
effect stems from recent clinical trials of PD-1 blockade
that resulted in significant survival benefit with minimal
toxicity to patients with advanced melanoma, renal cell
carcinoma, and non–small cell lung cancer [13–16].
In the current study, we report that significant
increase in PD-1/PD-L1 expression is an important
immunosuppressive mechanism in human and mouse
HNSCC. Oncogene activation by the conditional knockout
of Pten and Tgfbr1 may contribute to the over-expression
of PD-L1 with concomitantly significant increase in
MDSCs and TAMs. Moreover, we discovered that the
blockade of PD-1 significantly reduces CD11b+Gr1+
and CD11b+ F4/80+ cells in immune organs as well as in
tumors of the mouse model. Our study, in direct relevance
to clinical application, demonstrates that targeting PD-1/
PD-L1 can lead to durable antitumor immunity and
curative outcome, with remarkable reduction in MDSCs
and TAMs followed by enhanced immunoreactivity of
CD8+ T and CD4+ T cells. These findings will be valuable
in developing good strategies aimed at achieving more
effective immunotherapy to treat HNSCC.

Increased PD-1/PD-L1 expression in HNSCC
tissue is independent of HPV status
A recent interesting report identified the possible
over-expression of PD-1/PD-L1 in human HNSCC,
particularly in human papilloma virus (HPV) positive
patients. However, in the present patient cohort the main
anatomy origin of HNSCC was from oral cavity. Using
p16 immunostaining and HPV DNA in situ hybridization
technique to monitor HPV infection, we found that there
was no statistically significant difference in PD-1/PD-L1
expression in HPV+ (n = 12) and HPV- (n = 74) HNSCC
(Fig. 1C and 1D). This result prompted us to explore
whether there was a difference in PD-1 and PD-L1
expression in other viral-associated cancer settings. We
searched for viral related cancer datasets including TCGA
data using the Oncomine database. Our findings suggested
that there are no significant differences in the CD279/
CD274 DNA copy number or the mRNA levels in HPVrelated HNSCC or HPV-related cervical cancer (Fig. S2
and S3). Additionally, there is no difference in either
CD279 or CD274 expression in Epstein-Barr virus-related
lymphoma or Hepatitis B virus/Hepatitis C virus-related
hepatocellular carcinoma (Fig. S2 and S3). These results
indicated that PD-1 over-expression potentially play an
important role in both HPV+ and HPV- HNSCC.

PD-1/PD-L1 protein levels correlate with MDSCs
and TAMs in human HNSCC

RESULTS

Recent studies have demonstrated that MDSCs
and TAMs are predominantly cancer immune suppressor
cells [5], which prompted our study on the correlation of
PD-1/PD-L1 with MDSCs and TAMs. Immunostaining
with specific antibodies for CD68 and CD163, were
used to stain the M2 type macrophages in human
HNSCC tissue array. As shown in Fig. 1A, an increase
in CD68 and CD163 expression in the tumor areas of
HNSCCs compared with normal mucosa were observed

Increased expression of PD-1/PD-L1

database [17]. In a meta-analysis of 18 datasets of

Blockade of PD-1 prevents tumorigenesis in a
HNSCC mouse model

(see quantification in Fig.  S4A). Additionally, specific
antibodies for CD11b and CD33 were used to stain the
immune cells which are similar to mice Gr1+CD11b+
MDSCs (see quantification in Fig. S4A). The expression
of CD68, CD163, CD11b and CD33 was not related with
the HPV+ status (Fig. S4B). By hierarchy clustering and
linear regression, we found that the expression of PD-1
was closely related to the expression of CD11b, CD33,
CD68 and CD163, and in particular closely to CD11b and
CD33 (Fig. S4C and Fig. 1E). These observations suggest
that PD-1/PD-L1 are closely related to the TAMs as well
as MDSCs in human HNSCC. PD-1/PD-L1 expression
and the TAMs or MDSCs population were increased in
both HPV+ and HPV- HNSCC.

To determine the impact of PD-1 on carcinogenesis
in vivo, we utilized Tgfbr1/Pten 2cKO mouse HNSCC
model for chemopreventive tumorigenesis studies.
The initial dosage of the inhibiting PD-1 antibody was
applied at day 12. As the experimental paradigm shown
in Fig. 3A, we found that PD-1 blockade produced a
decrease in tumor growth, which indicated that in vivo
inhibition of PD-1 using RMP1–14 antibody (10mg/kg
intraperitoneally every other day) will delay (Fig. 3B)
tumorigenesis in head and neck area as well as in tongue
of the immunocompetent mice. The PD-1 blockade did not
cause additional cytotoxicity as judged by gain of body
weight in the treated mice as compared to the vehicle
only group (n = 6 respectively, P < 0.001, Fig. 3C).
Additionally, the head and neck tumor growth curve
and the number and size of the tumor demonstrated that
PD-1 blockade effectively reduced the tumor burden and
number of head neck tumors (Fig. 3D and 3E).

The loss of tumor suppressor genes increases
the expression of PD-L1 with TAMs and
MDSCs in mice
Our previous work reported a spontaneous
development of HNSCC in a mouse model by
combined deletion of important tumor suppressors
Pten and Tgfbr1 [18]. The tumor bearing mice showed
significantly increased expression of CD11b+ and Gr1+
cell populations in tumors and immune organs. To
detect multiple cytokines and chemokines in the mouse
HNSCC, we performed mouse cytokine antibody array
which profiles the expression of 40 key cytokine genes
involved in inflammation of mouse HNSCC tissues
(Fig. 2A). Surprisingly, we found that most significantly
increased cytokines such as sICAM-1 (CD54), M-CSF
CXCL1, CXCL2, CCL2 in the Tgfbr1/Pten 2cKO
HNSCC may attract monocytes. By quantitative PCR we
found that indeed the expression of important cytokines
Cd54, Csf-1, Cxcl1, Cxcl2 and Ccl2 was significantly
increased in 2cKO mouse HNSCC tumor lysates as
compared with 2cKO mouse tongue and the control
tongue (Fig. S5: n  = 5 respectively). We also found a
remarkable increase in CD11b+Gr1+ MDSCs (Fig. 2B:
n = 6 respectively, P < 0.001) as well as CD11b+F4/80+
TAMs (Fig. 2B: n = 6 respectively, P < 0.001) in Tgfbr1/
Pten 2cKO HNSCC. We further confirmed increased
expression of PD-1, PD-L1 with CCL2 and CXCL1
in the tumor lysaytes of 2cKO mice as compared with
syngeneic counterparts (Fig. 2C). A recent report
indicated that activation of oncogene Akt increases the
expression of PD-L1. Thus, we explored the exact role of
loss of function of Pten or Tgfbr1 in PD-L1 expression.
Western blot results consistently suggested that the loss
of PTEN and/or TGFBR1 increased expression of PD-L1
in human head neck cell line CAL27 (Fig.2D) and FaDu
(Fig. S6). This interesting finding has also been confirmed
by the observation of increased PD-L1 expression in
mouse HNSCC of Pten conditional knockout (Pten cKO)
mice, Tgfbr1 conditional knockout (Tgfbr1 cKO) mice
and Pten/Tgfbr1 2cKO mice (Fig. 2E).

Blockade of PD-1 decreases MDSCs and TAMs
in HNSCC mouse model
To determine whether PD-1/PD-L1 blockade
decreases the MDSCs as well as TAMs, we performed
flow cytometry analysis on the cells from the spleen, lymph
node, and blood as well as tumor tissue of Tgfbr1/Pten
2cKO mice with or without αPD-1 treatment. We found that
PD-1 blockade remarkably reduced CD11b+Gr1+ MDSCs in
spleen, lymph node, blood as well as in tumor as compared
with the vehicle only and wild-type syngeneic mice
(Fig. 4A and Fig. S7A). The CD11b+Gr1+ MDSCs are even
significantly attenuated in spleen and tumor. Western blot
analysis showed a significant decrease in CXCL1 and iNOS
levels in tumor lysates of αPD-1 blockade group as compared
with vehicle only group (Fig.  4B). Immunofluorescence
assay further showed a significant decrease in Gr1+CD11b+
double positive MDSCs cell population as compared with
control group (Fig. 4C and Fig. S7B). These results support
our hypothesis that PD-1 blockade can effectively decrease
MDSCs and TAMs in vivo.
In addition to MDSCs, we also investigated
CD11b+F4/80+ TAMs in αPD-1-treated 2cKO mice as
compared with vehicle only group. The flow cytometry
analysis showed similar results to those seen in MDSCs.
Tumor bearing mice had a significant increase in TAMs that
were significantly attenuated by αPD-1 treatment particularly
in spleen as well as in the tumors (Fig. 4D and Fig. S8).

suppressor immune cells such as Tregs and MDSCs is a
critical determinant of effective anti-tumor activity. We
sought to determine the effect on dendritic cells (DCs)
and T cells and found that PD-1 blockade significantly
increased matured DCs population as well as increased
CD8+ and CD4+ T cells. In tumor bearing Tgfbr1/Pten
2cKO mice, PD-1 blockade increased MHC-II+, CD40+,
CD86+ cells in spleen (Fig. 5A and Fig. S9). In blood of
tumor bearing Tgfbr1/Pten 2cKO mice, PD-1 blockade

increased MHC-II+ and CD40+cells (Fig. 5B and Fig. S9).
In tumor, inhibition of PD-1 effectively augmented
CD40+, CD80+, CD86+ cells, and especially significantly
increased MHC-II+ DCs (Fig. 5C and Fig. S9). A recent
report indicates that CD47/SIRPα axis plays an
important role by reducing mature DCs and attracting
tumor associate macrophages [19]. Our data suggested
that CD47 and SIRPα significantly increased in tumor
but this was attenuated by PD-1 blockade (Fig. 5D).

The immunofluorescence analysis also indicated that
CD47 was over expressed in both cancer cells and
inflammatory cells. SIRPα was mainly expressed in
inflammatory cells and overlapped with CD47+ cell in
peritumor inflammatory cells. PD-1 blockade decreased
the expression of CD47 and SIRPα (Fig. 5E).
To further investigate the number of CD4+ and CD8+
T cells, we took advantage of flow cytometry and found
inhibition of PD-1 significantly decreased PD-1+ cells in
spleen, lymph node as well as in blood (Fig. 6A and 6B),
accompanied by an increase in CD4+ (Fig. 6A and 6C)
and CD8+ (Fig. 6A and 6D) T cells in spleen, lymph
node and blood. In tumors, PD-1 blockade significantly
decreased PD-1+ cells accompanied by an increase
in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells (Fig. 6A and 6E). Then, we
investigated the expression of PD-1 and PD-L1 in mouse
tumors with or without αPD-1 treatment (Fig. 6F). The
reversal of immune tolerance status by PD-1 blockade
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

can also be indicated by observation of reduced spleen
size in αPD-1 group as compared with vehicle only group
(Fig. 6G). Overall, these results suggest that the prior to
the treatment peripheral effector /suppressor balance in
PD-1 blocker treated mice is already skewed towards
immunosuppression.

DISCUSSION
Suppression of the host immune system plays
a major role in cancer progression. The activation
of the co-inhibitory checkpoint molecule PD-1 in
T cells and expansion of MDSCs are considered the
major mechanisms for tumor to escape from immune
surveillance [20]. Although targeted PD-1/PD-L1 therapy
achieved a significant cure in melanoma and lung cancer
[21, 22], the importance of this axis in HNSCC is less

recognized. For the first time, we demonstrate here that
the increase of PD-1/PD-L1 axis correlates with expansion
of key suppressor immune cell populations, MDSCs and
TAMs, in human HNSCC as well as in HNSCC mouse
model that develops spontaneous tumors. Moreover, our
study provides direct evidence that systematic application
of αPD-1 monoclonal antibody demonstrates a remarkable
decrease in tumorigenesis with significantly reduced
MDSCs and TAMs populations and increased effector
T cells. Molecular analysis identified that αPD-1 treatment
significantly decreases myeloid cells and chemokine levels
as well as decrease in CD47/SIRPα signaling.
Alcohol/tobacco abuse and HPV infection are the
main risk factors associated with the development of
HNSCC [23, 24]. Although HPV- HNSCCs are different
from HPV+ HNSCC in several ways [25, 26], there
is no significant difference in PD-1/PD-L1 expression
between HPV+ and HPV- HNSCC [27, 28]. Our data
further demonstrate that MDSCs and TAMs frequency is
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

independent of HPV infection status. As compared with
HPV+ tumors, PTEN loss was found to be more frequent
in HPV- HNSCC [25]. We found PTEN loss promotes
the expression of PD-L1 in HNSCC cell line and in the
conditional Pten−/− mice, which is consistent with recent
observations in breast and prostate cancers [29]. The
present study also suggests that TGFBR1 loss further
enhances the expression of PD-L1 in HNSCC cell lines
and conditional Tgfbr1−/− mice, which indicate that loss
of TGFBR1 may be an crucial molecular event leading
to the accumulation of PD-L1 in both HPV infection and
alcohol or tobacco use [18, 30]. Moreover, PTEN loss
and TGFBR1 loss synergistically promote activation of
PD-L1, likely by the activation of oncogenic Akt pathway
in Tgfbr1/Pten 2cKO mice [31]. Taken together, our in
vitro and in vivo studies revealed that loss of PTEN and
TGFBR1 together promote the activation of PD-1 and PDL1 pathway in HNSCC, independent of the HPV infection
status.

More recent reports have suggested the close
relationship of PD-1/PD-L1 with MDSCs and TAMs [32].
Our previous [18] and present study together reveals a
significant accumulation of MDSCs and TAMs along with
increase in putative myeloid cytokines and chemokines
in HNSCC tumorigenesis in mice. We further confirmed
that increased expression of PD-1, PD-L1 in HNSCC
correlated with accumulation of MDSCs and TAMs in
human and mouse HNSCC. As expected, PD-1 blockade
significantly reduced tumorigenesis in Tgfbr1/Pten 2cKO
mice. Moreover, a remarkable reduction of MDSCs
cell populations in tumor and immune organs by PD-1
blockade was observed, which can be attributed to the
decrease of CXCL1. The expression of iNOS in MDSC has
been shown to be critical for the suppression of T cell [33].
Therefore, the reduction in iNOS further promotes the
activation of T cell in tumor microenvironment. PD-1 has
also been implicated in the regulation of M2 macrophages
and inhibition of PD-1 can induce the polarization of
macrophages to M1 phenotype [34]. The current study first
outlines that PD-1 blockade has an antitumor function in
HNSCC, at least partially, dependent on the role of CD47/
SIRPα which functions as a “do not eat me” signal in
many malignancies. Blockade of CD47/SIRPα axis led
to efficient and rapid phagocytosis of multiple tumor
cell types [35]. In our in vivo study, down-regulation of
expression of CD47 in tumor cells by blockade PD-1
may improve phagocytosis of macrophage to enhance
antitumor immunity.
Analogous to macrophages, the current study also
demonstrated αPD-1 treatment promotes maturation of
DCs. With exposure to antigens stimuli, DCs undergo
a maturation process by increasing expression of
co-stimulatory molecules such as MHC-II, CD40, CD80
and CD86, producing pro-inflammatory cytokines and
presenting antigens to T cells [36]. Indeed, blockade of
PD-1 increased the expression levels of co-stimulatory
molecular in mouse tumor and immune organ suggesting
the condition of immune suppression was improved in
the tumor microenvironment, which may be caused by
decreased CD47/SIRPα signaling. Consistently, recent
reports indicated that activation of the CD47/SIRPα
signaling pathway enables to restrain DCs maturation [19]
and that inhibition of CD47/SIRPα may increase DCsmediated antigen presentation [37]. The results in our
study, especially in spleen and blood, demonstrated
that the mechanisms by which tumor escape immune
survelience depend on the tumor itself but also in changing
conditions in tumor macro-environment [38].
PD-1/PD-L1 plays an important role in inhibiting
tumor immune response by promoting CD4+ and CD8+
T cells apoptosis [39]. In addition to directly reducing
CD4+ and CD8+ T cells apoptosis, PD-1 blockade may also
restore T cell activity by decreasing the CD47 expression
in the tumor microenvironment [40]. At the same time,
DCs that could be partially activated by co-stimulatory
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

molecules in the tumor microenvironment could then
promote effective antitumor T cells responses [41]. The
current study also revealed that blockade of PD-1 could
decrease arginase 1 and iNOS which enhance T cells
proliferation to promote antitumor immunity [42, 43]. We
have also demonstrated a significant correlation between
PD-1 expression and infiltration of CD11b+/CD33+
(markers of human MDSCs) cells in human HNSCC
tissues microarray.
The clinical significance of PD-1 blockade for
HNSCC treatment is supported by phase III single
agent clinical trial of PD-1 antibody Nivolumab (BMS936558, NCT02105636; see review of Zandberg DP) [44].
Anti-PD-1 mAB appears to be generally less toxic as
compared to anti-CTLA4 mAB, with a slightly different
toxicity profile such as pneumonitis [45]. To date, there
are not too many general adverse events reported for
anti-PD-1, including fatigue, pyrexia, chills and infusion
reaction [46]. The current study suggests that targeting
the PD-1/PD-L1 signaling pathway to reverse the
immunosuppressive status has important therapeutic
implications for the treatment of HNSCC. Nevertheless,
we cannot completely exclude the possibility that PD-1
blockade may have indirect role on tumorigenesis
through angiogenesis and by targeting cancer stem
cell mediated by MDSCs and TAMs [47]. In addition,
a recent report indicated increased MDSCs [16] and
PD-1+ CD4 T cells [48] in cancer patients receiving
chemo-radiotherapy, which provides a rationale for
combined treatment with chemo-radiotherapy and PD-1
blockade.
In summary, we discovered a significant increase of
PD-1/PD-L1 in HNSCC, which is tightly correlated with
important immune suppressor cells, MDSCs and TAMs.
Taking advantage of immunocompetent transgenic mouse
HNSCC models, we observed a decrease in MDSCs,
TAMs, and mature DCs as well as an increase in CD8+
T cells and CD4+ T cells by PD-1 blockade in micro- and
macro- tumor environment. Therefore, we believe that
therapeutically blocking the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway may
prove to be a promising antitumor therapy for HNSCC.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Detailed methods and procedures are provided in the
Supplementary Data.

Genetically modified mice
All experiments were conducted in accordance
with the guidelines of the Institutional Animal Care and
Use Committee of the Wuhan University. Time inducible
tissue-specific Tgfbr1/Pten 2cKO mouse (K14-CreERtam+/-;
Tgfbr1flox/flox; Ptenflox/flox) were maintained and genotyped
according to published protocols [49, 50]. The details of
Tgfbr1 cKO HNSCC mouse (K14-CreERtam+/-; Tgfbr1flox/flox),

Oncotarget

Western blotting and quantitative real-time
RT-PCR analysis

Pten cKO HNSCC mice (K14-CreERtam+/-; Pten flox/flox) were
previously described [49, 50]. All the mice were bred in
the FVBN/CD1/129/C57 mixed background.

Western blotting and quantitative real-time RT-PCR
analysis were performed as previously described [49].

PD-1 antibody treatment

Human HNSCC tissue array

The in vivo MAb anti mPD1 antibody
(RMP1–14) was purchased from BioXcell (West
Lebanon, NH, USA) After oral gavage of tamoxifen for
5 consequent days, the Tgfbr1/Pten 2cKO mice were
randomly divides into control group (PBS, i.p. daily,
n  = 6 mice), 10 mg/kg RMP1–14 treated group (i.p.
daily: n = 6 mice). RMP1–14 and vehicle treatment were
performed 10 days after tamoxifen induction and the
mice were observed for 18 days. Syngeneic wide type
control mice (K14-CreERtam+/-; Tgfbr1flox/flox; Ptenflox/flox)
treated with the same dose of tamoxifen were used as
controls (n = 6). The tumor sizes were measured using
a micrometer caliper and by taking photographs every
other day. The mice were euthanized at the end of the
studies (day 40 based on pilot study).

School and Hospital of Stomatology of Wuhan
University Medical Ethics Committee approved this
study, and informed consent was obtained from the
patients before they underwent surgery. Custom made
tissue microarray including 86 HNSCC, 12 oral epithelial
dysplasia and 32 normal oral mucosa tissue samples were
used for immunohistochemistry staining as previous
described [4].

Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence
Tumors from Tgfbr1/Pten 2cKO mice were dissected
and fixed as previously described [31], and slides were
stained with the appropriate antibody using a standard
immunohistochemical and double immunofluorescence
staining protocol as previously described [52].

Proteome profiler antibody array analysis
The mouse cytokine array panel an array kit
(ARY006, R&D Systems) were used to analyze tissue
lysates from pooled wide type tongue mucosa samples,
Tgfbr1/Pten 2cKO tongue mucosa and 5 Tgfbr1/Pten 2cKO
tongue SCC (n = 5 respectively) Average optical intensity
of duplicate spots for each cytokine was normalized to the
average of positive controls on the same chip using the
Image J software (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA).

Scoring system, hierarchical clustering and data
visualization
Whole slices were scanned and quantified of
histoscore using an Aperio ScanScope CS scanner with
a background substrate for each slice, quantification as
previously described [53]. The hierarchical analysis was
achieved using the Cluster 3.0 with average linkage based
on Pearson’s correlation coefficient [54].

Flow cytometry analysis

Statistical analysis

To obtain single cell suspensions, tumor tissues of
Tgfbr1/Pten 2cKO mice with or without PD-1 blockade
antibody RMP1–14 treatment were processed using a
gentle Macs dissociator and a murine tumor dissociation
kit (Miltenyi Biotec). Single cell suspensions from
spleens, lymph node, and blood were prepared according
to a standardized protocol [51]. Wild type controls with
the same dose of tamoxifen were used for flow cytometry
analysis.

Statistical evaluations were undertaken with Graph
Pad Prism version 5.0. One-way ANOVA followed by
the post-Tukey multiple comparison tests were used to
analyze the differences in protein levels, RNA levels and
positive cells among each group. Student t test was used
to analyze immunostaining of the difference between
the PD-1 blockade group and vehicle group. Two-tailed
Pearson’s statistics was used for the correlated histoscore.
The mean values ± SEM with a difference of P < 0.05
were considered statistically significant.

Cell culture and RNAi
