ABSTRACT
Breast carcinogenesis is a multi-step process in which membrane receptor tyrosine
kinases are crucial participants. Lots of research has been done on epidermal growth
factor receptor (EGFR) and HER-2 with important clinical results. However, breast
cancer patients present intrinsic or acquired resistance to available HER-2-directed
therapies, mainly due to HER-3. Using new techniques, such as proximity ligation assay,
herein we evaluate the dimerization pattern of HER-3 and the importance of contextdependent dimer formation between HER-3 and other HER protein family members.
Additionally, we show that the efficacy of novel HER-3 targeting agents can be better
predicted in certain breast cancer patient sub-groups based on the dimerization
pattern of HER protein family members. Moreover, this model was also evaluated and
reproduced in human paraffin-embedded breast cancer tissues.

Expression of all four HER receptors is necessary
during normal development of mammary gland [5].
Expression of HER receptors in breast carcinomas is
a common event. HER-2 over-expression is present in
20-30% of breast carcinomas and is associated with
dismal prognosis [6]. Additionally, a sub-population of
HER-2 over-expressing breast cancer patients expresses
a truncated active form, p95 HER-2, which lacks the
extracellular domain. Cells carrying the truncated form
of HER-2 protein are more prone to constant HER-2
homodimer activity and uncontrolled growth, division and
avoidance of apoptosis [7]. HER-3 is often over-expressed
in human breast cancer cells due to higher protein
expression or increased half-life of the receptor. HER-3
increased expression in breast tumors has been correlated
with poor prognostic features, such as increased metastatic
potential, high tumor grade and increased recurrent rate
[8, 9]. However, it should be noted that a recent metaanalysis did not find any correlation between HER-3
expression and breast cancer survival [10]. Although not
frequently over-expressed in breast cancers, HER-4 is

INTRODUCTION
The ErbB/HER receptors are type I growth factor
receptors with tyrosine kinase (TK) activity; epidermal
growth factor receptor 1 (also called EGFR, ErbB1 or HER1), HER-2 (ErbB2), HER-3 (ErbB3) and HER-4 (ErbB4)
[1]. They consist of a trans-membrane hydrophobic domain
that separates an extracellular ligand-binding domain and an
intracellular TK domain. In order to activate their TK activity,
ligands that contain an epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like
domain bind to HER receptors. Different EGF-like ligands
activate different receptors of the HER family, except HER-2
which has no identified ligand yet [2]. Then, dimer formation
between the four receptors occurs to activate the TK domain.
Upon activation, HER receptors stimulate downstream
pathways that are involved in apoptosis, proliferation,
differentiation, angiogenesis, epithelial–mesenchymal
transition (EMT) and cell motility [3, 4]. Deregulation and
subsequent aberrant signaling of HER protein family due to
mutation, amplification or presence of autocrine / paracrine
loops enhances the development of breast carcinomas.

correlated with good prognosis and seems to antagonize
HER-2-related dismal clinical outcome [11]. Furthermore,
over-expression of both HER-3 and HER-4 has been also
associated with favorable clinical outcome [12].
There are multiple potential ligands for HER protein
family receptors. The ligands that activate HER receptors,
except HER-2, are expressed as trans-membrane precursors
and contain a conserved structural region, the EGF-like
domain. This family consists of 13 members, each of
which binds a specific receptor and induce the homo- or
hetero-dimerization of HER receptors [13, 14]. EGF,
transforming growth factor alpha (TGFα), betacellulin
(BC), amphiregulin (AR), epiregulin (EPR), heparinbinding EGF-like ligand (HB-EGF) and epigen are HER1 ligands. Neuregulin (also known as heregulin) 1 and 2
(NRG1, NRG2 or HRG1, HRG2) are HER-3 and HER-4
ligands, while HER-4 has additionally NRG3, NRG4 and
share ligands BC, EPR, HB-EGF and epigen with HER-1
receptor. HER-2 is a “ligand-free” receptor and can activate
its TK domain through auto-phosphorylation after homo- or
hetero-dimerization with other HER partners.
Based on HER-2 over-expression at protein level or
gene amplification, breast cancer patients are treated with
anti-HER-2 agents. Herceptin (trastuzumab) is an antibody
against the extracellular domain of HER-2 receptor
[6]. Pertuzumab, another novel anti-HER-2 antibody
binds to the dimerization sites of the HER-2 receptor
inhibiting more effectively its dimerization and HRGinduced activation through HER-3 [15]. Combinational
therapy of HER-2 breast carcinomas with trastuzumab
and pertuzumab has shown positive clinical results [16,
17]. Additionally, HER-2 / HER-1 TK inhibitors, such
as lapatinib, are being used in breast cancer therapeutics
[18]. So far it was believed that activation of HER-2
occurs only when HER-2 is over-expressed, amplified or
in the presence of a truncated form. Many breast cancer
patients present intrinsic or acquired resistance, attributed
to various mechanisms, to anti-HER-2-directed therapies
[19]. Growing evidence support the participation of HER3 and HRGs in activation of HER-2, regardless of its
expression. Preliminary results show that HER-2 overexpression might not be necessary and activation of HER-3
and/or HER-4 by HRGs might be enough to subsequently
activate HER-2 [20–23]. There is a notion that patients
with increased levels of HRGs but negative or low
expression of HER-2 and low or high HER-3 expression,
could benefit from treatment with anti-HER-2 agents [24].
Most protein biomarker studies, regarding HER
family, have focused on blood and tissue samples,
examining solely one member of this family. The
ability to detect specific protein–protein interactions and
post-translational modifications in blood and/or tissue
as biomarkers for a plethora of human pathological
conditions holds great promise for molecular medicine.
The proximity ligation assay (PLA) is a versatile
molecular tool that has many advantages, such as minimal
sample consumption and flexible assay reconfiguration
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

[25]. In the present study we used PLA to study the
dimerization pattern of HER protein family members
after treatment of MCF-7 (not HER-2 amplified) and
SKBR3 (HER-2 amplified) human breast cancer cells
with or without HRG1 and various HER-2 / HER-3
blocking agents (trastuzumab, pertuzumab and U3-1287).
In addition, the HER dimerization pattern was evaluated
in paraffin-embedded human breast cancer tissues with
various HER-2 expression levels.

RESULTS
HER dimerization pattern after the addition of
heregulin
We initially investigated the formation of HER
dimers with and without the addition of heregulin (HRG)
(Figures 1–5).
In MCF-7 cells (PLA signal scales 0-12), there
was a high incidence of HER-1:HER-3 (8,07 vs 3,36)
and HER-1:HER-4 (9,70 vs 5,13) heterodimers as well
as HER-1:HER-1 (2,55 vs 0,60) homodimer formation.
As expected, subtle differences were observed after the
addition of HRG regarding formation of HER-2:HER-3
and HER-2:HER-4 heterodimers. HRG is the main ligand
that activates HER-3 and HER-4 [23]. In MCF-7 breast
cancer cell line, HRG has been shown to increase a
sustained mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signal
activity favoring differentiation, whereas EGF only elicits
a transient MAPK signal activity favoring cell proliferation
[26, 27]. The identification of the dimerization pattern as
well as the transcriptional networks stimulated by HER
receptors under different conditions is important for better
understanding breast cancer progression.
Contrary to MCF-7 cells, in SKBR3 cells (PLA
signal scales 0-90) there was a high incidence of HER1:HER-4 (83,75 vs 40) and HER-2:HER-3 (26,93 vs 15,92)
heterodimers, while there was only a small amount of HER1:HER-1 (17,5 vs 13,6) homodimers. Furthermore, a slight
increase of HER-1:HER-3 (16 vs 10,6) and HER-2:HER-4
(16 vs 9,4) heterodimers was also found. It seems that in
HER-2 positive breast cancer cells, at least in vitro, HRG
stimulates the formation of certain HER-3- and HER-4based heterodimers, thus generating new data regarding the
way we could therapeutically target them.

HER dimerization pattern after the addition of
trastuzumab
We next examined the formation of HER dimers
with and without the addition of HRG and trastuzumab
(T) (Figure 1A and 1B). T is a humanized monoclonal
antibody that binds to domain IV of the extracellular
portion of HER-2 receptor and has generated
significant clinical results in the treatment of early
stage and metastatic HER-2 positive breast cancer
patients [6].

In MCF-7 cells (PLA signal scales 0-12), the cotreatment of cells with HRG and T compared to T alone
resulted in a lower percentage of HER-1:HER-3 (2,10
vs 5,38) and a higher percentage of HER-1:HER-4 (7,69
vs 3,40) heterodimer formation. Notably, there was a
reduction in HER-2:HER-4 heterodimer formation after
treatment with T compared with the addition of HRG
alone, while no discernible difference was observed
after the combination of HRG with T vs T alone. Subtle
differences were detected after the combination of T
and HRG regarding the formation of HER-2:HER-3
heterodimer and HER-1:HER-1 homodimer (Figure 1A).
In SKBR3 cells (PLA signal scales 0-90), the
co-treatment of cells with HRG and T compared to T
alone resulted in a higher percentage of HER-1:HER-3
(9,56 vs 2,31) and a slight higher percentage of HER1:HER-4 (28,5 vs 24,3) heterodimer formation. Of
note, a reduction in HER-2:HER-4 and HER-2:HER-3
heterodimer formation after treatment with T was
found compared with the addition of HRG alone, albeit
an increase was observed after the combination of
HRG with T vs T alone. Notable differences were also
detected after the combination of T and HRG compared
to HRG alone regarding the formation of HER-1:HER-1
homodimer (6,62 vs 17,5), suggesting that in HER-2
positive breast cancer cells, at least in vitro, HRG might
also act as HER-1 activating ligand (Figure 1B).

difference was observed regarding the formation of HER1:HER-1 homodimer (Figure 2A).
In SKBR3 cells (PLA signal scales 0-90), the cotreatment of cells with HRG and P compared to P alone,
opposite to the addition of T, resulted in a considerably
higher percentage of HER-1:HER-4 (17 vs 6,67) and a
slightly lower percentage of HER-1:HER-3 (12,5 vs 16,67)
heterodimer formation. Notably, a reduction in HER2:HER-4 and HER-2:HER-3 heterodimer formation after
treatment with P was found compared with the addition
of HRG alone, although an increase was detected after
the combination of HRG with P vs P alone. Discernible
differences were also detected after the combination of P
and HRG compared to HRG alone regarding the formation
of HER-1:HER-1 homodimer (6,25 vs 17,5) (Figure 2B).

HER dimerization pattern after the addition of
U3-1287 (U3)
We then examined the formation of HER dimers
with and without the addition of HRG and U3-1287
(Figure 3A and 3B). U3-1287 (U3), now known as
AMG 888, is a HER-3 fully humanized neutralizing
monoclonal antibody that has been previously shown to
decrease HER-3 from the cell surface and also inhibit
the augmentation of HER-3 following HER-2 inhibition.
Moreover, U3 in combination with HER-2 inhibitors can
activate apoptosis in vitro, partially restore sensitivity to
T in T-resistant xenografts and improves their survival
[29]. U3 has been also reported to inhibit HER-3-induced
extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling and
in vitro and in vivo growth of multiple tumor cell lines as
single agent or in combination with other HER inhibitors
[30, 31]. Although the exact biochemical properties of
U3 have not been disclosed yet, it is currently in early
clinical testing [32, 33]. Nevertheless, no clinical data are
so far available regarding its activity in breast carcinomas,
while predictive biomarkers that are being evaluated
are primarily based on HRG levels and not on HER-3
dimerization pattern [34].
In MCF-7 cells (PLA signal scales 0-12), the cotreatment of cells with HRG and U3 compared to U3 alone
resulted in a lower percentage of HER-1:HER-3 (0,60
vs 1,71) and HER-1:HER-4 (0,60 vs 4,24) heterodimer
formation. Of note, there was also a reduction in HER2:HER-4 heterodimer formation compared with the
addition of HRG or U3 alone. Notable reduction of HER2:HER-3 heterodimer (0,60 vs 1,62) was detected after
the combination of U3 and HRG, while subtle differences
were observed with the same combination regarding
the formation of HER-1:HER-1 homodimer (Figure
3A). Therefore, it seems that U3, through its direct antiHER-3 activity, exhibits more potent inhibition of HER
dimerization compared to T and P after treatment with
HRG.

HER dimerization pattern after the addition of
pertuzumab
We went on to explore the formation of HER dimers
with and without the addition of HRG and pertuzumab (P)
(Figure 2A and 2B). P is a monoclonal antibody that binds
to domain II of the extracellular portion of HER-2 receptor
and inhibits ligand-mediated dimerization of HER-2 with
other protein family members, among them HER-3 [28]. P
has been recently approved for the treatment of metastatic
and locally advanced (as neoadjuvant treatment) HER-2
positive breast cancer patients in combination with T and
chemotherapy [16, 17].
In MCF-7 cells (PLA signal scales 0-12), the cotreatment of cells with HRG and P compared to P alone
resulted, contrarily to the addition of T, in a higher
percentage of HER-1:HER-3 (2,46 vs 0,64) as well as HER1:HER-4 (4,67 vs 3,27) heterodimer formation. Noteworthy,
there was an increase in HER-2:HER-4 heterodimer
formation after treatment with P, opposite to the addition
of T, compared to the addition of HRG alone, while no
discernible difference was found after the combination of
HRG with P vs P alone. Notable reduction of HER-2:HER-3
heterodimer (3,0 vs 6,19) was detected after the combination
of P and HRG, contrarily to the combination of T and HRG,
while P increased HER-2:HER-3 heterodimer formation
relevant to HRG alone. Additionally, no discernible

HER dimerization pattern after the combination
of trastuzumab and U3-1287

In SKBR3 cells (PLA signal scales 0-90), the cotreatment of cells with HRG and U3 compared to HRG
alone resulted in an impressively low percentage of
HER-1:HER-4 (0,7 vs 83,75) and HER-1:HER-3 (0,7
vs 16) heterodimer formation, while no difference was
detected with the combination of HRG plus U3 vs U3
alone. Remarkably, there was also a discernible reduction
in HER-2:HER-4 (0,7 vs 16) and HER-2:HER-3 (0,7 vs
26,93) heterodimer formation after the addition of U3
compared with the addition of HRG alone, while again
no difference was detected with the combination of HRG
plus U3 vs U3 alone. Notable differences were also
detected after the combination of U3 and HRG compared
to HRG alone regarding the formation of HER-1:HER-1
homodimer (0,7 vs 17,5) (Figure 3B).
These results drive to the following assumptions: i)
U3 has more potent activity than T and P in suppressing
dimer formation in HER-2 positive breast cancer cells;
ii) HRG addition does not seem to correlate with U3
dimerization-inhibiting activity in HER-2 positive breast
cancer cells and might not represent a valuable predictive
biomarker of its activity; iii) in HER-2 positive breast
cancer cells, at least in vitro, HRG might act as HER-1activating ligand and U3 seems to inhibit this activity.

We finally explored the formation of HER dimers
with and without the addition of HRG and T plus U3
(Figure 5A and 5B).
In MCF-7 cells (PLA signal scales 0-12), the cotreatment of cells with HRG and T plus U3 compared to
T plus U3 alone resulted in a slightly higher percentage
of HER-1:HER-3 (2,44 vs 1,71) and HER-1:HER-4
(2,84 vs 2,33) heterodimer formation. Notably, there was
also an increase of HER-2:HER-4 and HER-2:HER-3
heterodimers as well as HER-1:HER-1 homodimer
compared with the addition of T plus U3 alone (Figure
5A).These results imply that the addition of T possibly
partly suppresses the activity of U3 against HRG-induced
dimer formation.
In SKBR3 cells (PLA signal scales 0-90), the cotreatment of cells with HRG and T plus U3 compared to
HRG alone resulted again in a strikingly low percentage
of HER-1:HER-4 (8,77 vs 83,75) and HER-1:HER-3
(2,44 vs 16) heterodimer formation, while no difference
was detected with the combination of HRG with T plus
U3 vs T plus U3 alone. Interestingly enough, there was
also a discernible reduction in HER-2:HER-4 (3,82 vs
16) and HER-2:HER-3 (2,81 vs 26,93) heterodimer
formation after the addition of T plus U3 compared with
the addition of HRG alone, while again no difference was
detected with the combination of HRG and T plus U3 vs
T plus U3 alone. Notable differences were also observed
after the combination of T plus U3 and HRG compared
to HRG alone regarding the formation of HER-1:HER-1
homodimer (1,27 vs 17,5) (Figure 5B).
These data in conjunction with those presented
earlier put in the assumption that adding T to U3 in HER-2
positive breast cancer cells does not increase the potential
of U3 to inhibit HER dimerization.

HER dimerization pattern after the combination
of trastuzumab and pertuzumab
We subsequently investigated the formation of HER
dimers with and without the addition of HRG and T plus P
combination (Figure 4A and 4B).
In MCF-7 cells (PLA signal scales 0-12), the cotreatment of cells with HRG and T plus P compared
to T plus P alone resulted in similar results with the
combination of HRG and P alone. Noteworthy, there was
a reduction in HER-2:HER-4 (3 vs 6,2) and HER-2:HER-3
(1,62 vs 4,13) heterodimer formation compared with the
addition of HRG alone, while no discernible difference
was found after the combination of HRG with T plus P vs
T plus P alone. Subtle difference was also detected with
the same combination regarding the formation of HER1:HER-1 homodimer (Figure 4A).
In SKBR3 cells (PLA signal scales 0-90), the cotreatment of cells with HRG and T plus P compared to T
plus P alone resulted in a bit higher percentage of HER1:HER-4 and HER-1:HER-3 heterodimer formation.
Of note, there was also a reduction in HER-2:HER-4
(9,56 vs 16) and HER-2:HER-3 (12,5 vs 26,93)
heterodimer formation compared with the addition
of HRG alone, whereas a slight increase was found
after the combination of HRG with T plus P vs T plus
P alone. Notable differences were also detected after
the combination of T plus P and HRG compared with
HRG alone regarding the formation of HER-1:HER-1
homodimer (9,13 vs 17,5) (Figure 4B).

HER dimerization pattern in human breast
tumor tissues
To expand our findings in the in vivo setting, we
employed PLA to examine the dimerization pattern
of HER protein family members in human paraffinembedded breast cancer tissues with three HER-2
expression patterns, based on the HER-2 evaluation
recommendation guidelines of ASCO/CAP [35]. To
this end we assessed 5 breast tumor samples with HER2 immunohistochemistry (IHC) score 0 (group 1), 5
breast tumor samples with HER-2 IHC score 1+ / 2+ and
fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) negative (group
2) and 5 breast tumor samples with HER-2 IHC score 3+
and FISH positive (group 3). As anticipated, in group 3
a high frequency of membrane-bound HER-2:HER-3 and
HER-1:HER-3 heterodimers was detected, whilst a high

number of HER-1:HER-4 heterodimer and HER-1:HER-1
homodimer was also found (Figures 6 and 7). This is in
concert with the results obtained in SKBR3 cells (Figures
1B, 2B, 3B, 4B, 5B). Therefore, in group 3 patients the
application of HER-2 and/or HER-3 targeting agents
seems the most rational therapeutic strategy. The role of
HER-4 in breast carcinogenesis is still obscure but the
increased percentage of HER-1:HER-4 heterodimers in
this group of patients might represent a separate redundant
mechanism by which HER-4 stimulates EGFR signaling
events and thus consists a dismal dimerization profile
[36]. The formation of HER-1:HER-1 homodimers seems
to be in harmony with the previously described theory of
pre-existing homodimers that may alter receptor–ligand
binding properties [37], while it verifies the notion that
HER-2 holds a central role regarding HER-1 and HER-3
levels as well as their dimerization patterns [38]. However,
as described above, HER-1:HER-4 heterodimer and HER1:HER-1 homodimer can be effectively decreased after
treatment with HER-2 and/or HER-3 targeting agents
(Figures 1B, 2B, 3B, 4B, 5B).

Remarkably, in group 2 patients among all
evaluated HER dimers, the most prevalent was the
HER-1:HER-3 heterodimer, which probably represents
a percentage of HER-2 negative breast tumors that may
bear the potential to show growth inhibition and hence
clinical benefit with HER-3-directed agents (Figures
6 and 7). This is partly in agreement with the results
obtained in MCF-7 cells (Figures 1A, 2A, 3A, 4A,
5A). Though the expression of HRG which has been
used as a promising predictive biomarker in recent
studies with HER-3 inhibitors [39] was not measured,
based on our in vitro data we pose that PLA-detected
dimerization pattern is a more reliable and easily
reproducible predictive biomarker for HER-3 targeting
agents, since HRG is a ligand for both HER-3 and
HER-4, and probably HER-1 (Figures 1A, 2A, 3A, 4A,
5A). In group 1 patients no HER dimer was detected
in significant amounts, in accordance with the existing
knowledge that in such tumors HER targeting has no
biological rationale and does not offer any clinical
benefit (Figures 6 and 7).

DISCUSSION

HER dimer species, which activate intracellular pathways
in a dimer-specific manner. In this vein, we unexpectedly
found that in SKBR3 (HER-2 amplified) cells HRG1
might also act as HER-1 activating ligand, highlighting the
complexity and plasticity of HER dimerization process.
Various computational models have been generated in
order to elucidate HER signaling events during breast
cancer evolution [51, 52], although a definitive one is still
missing.
The presence of HRG ligands in breast cancer
tissues is thought to represent a potential resistance
mechanism to anti-HER-2 targeting agents, such as
trastuzumab and pertuzumab, as they can activate
remnant-non-bound HER-2 receptors through HER3 binding [14, 53, 54]. Autocrine or paracrine-derived
HRG1 can also activate the formation of HER-2:HER-3
heterodimers, which has been found to be effectively
blocked by pertuzumab, but not trastuzumab [55]. In
order to clarify the effect of HRG1 and HER-3 on HER
dimerization, we evaluated in breast cancer cell lines the
dimer formation pattern after the addition of trastuzumab,
pertuzumab and their combination with or without HRG1.
Our results are in accord with previous reports regarding
HER-3-based dimers. However, we found that HER-1- and
HER-4-based dimer formation is differently stimulated by
trastuzumab and pertuzumab and that their combinatorial
use produces greater reduction of all HER-1- and HER4-based dimers, thus generating a better clinical effect in
breast cancer cells.
HER-3 is usually co-expressed with other receptor
TKs in breast cancer cells [1]. It promotes tumor initiation
and progression through activation of the PI3K/Akt
pathway, which participates in breast cancer progression
as well as in resistance mechanism of currently used
endocrine and anti-HER-2 targeted regimens [56]. HER3 targeting with ATP-competitive small molecules is not
feasible, since this receptor lacks intrinsic TK activity.
Nevertheless, new HER-3 selective inhibitors are being
created in order to inhibit its dimerization capacity
with HER-1 and/or HER-2 [57, 58]. Furthermore,
various monoclonal antibodies targeting HER-3 are
being developed and evaluated regarding their ability
to degrade the receptor and suppress downstream
signaling [59, 60]. Importantly, some of these antibodies
have been engineered in such a way to also target other
membrane receptors (e.g. HER-1, HER-2, insulin-like
growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R)) [61]. Several of these
compounds have already entered clinical testing, while
potential biomarkers of HER-3 targeting agents are being
investigated [9, 18]. In this vein, we evaluated in breast
cancer cell lines the dimer formation pattern after the
addition of trastuzumab, U3 and their combination with
or without HRG1. Our data reveal that HER-3 selective
inhibitors have more potent activity regarding HER
dimerization inhibition, compared with trastuzumab
and/or pertuzumab. Additionally, we found that the

Over-expression and/or increased activation of HER
receptors have been demonstrated in breast carcinomas.
These receptors usually exist as inactive monomers, with
the exception of HER-2. Their dimerization is an essential
step for their stimulation and downstream activity. Exactly
which dimers are assembled each time is dependent on
the available ligands and their relative affinities for each
receptor. Following ligand binding the two receptormonomers associate and the TK domain is activated
through trans-phosphorylation. Dynamic technologies
have evaluated the significance of HER expression and
downstream pathways on transcriptional regulation [38,
40]. However, HER dimerization pattern is contextdependent and correlates with the downstream effective
networks. HER dimers have been investigated with coimmunoprecipitation and immunohistochemical methods
[41]. In the present study we employed in situ PLA to
identify membrane-bound protein–protein interactions
of HER receptors at various conditions [42]. To date, the
data regarding the evaluation of HER dimerization pattern
with PLA are scarce [43–46]. For example, PLA has
been previously used for the detection of HER-2:HER-3
heterodimers in human tissues and this detection has been
correlated with dismal clinical outcome [46]. However,
herein we examined, for the first time, the dimerization
pattern of all HER family members after the addition
of HRG1 and HER-2 / HER-3 inhibitors (trastuzumab,
pertuzumab and U3). Additionally, we assessed HER
dimerization pattern in human breast cancer tissues that
were categorized in three groups according to their HER-2
expression level.
HRG ligands are vitally engaged in normal
mammary gland development and function as well as in
breast carcinogenesis. The HRG family comprises four
genes and their differentially spliced mRNA products
give rise to several variant proteins. HRG1 is a ligand
for HER-3 and HER-4 receptors and activates HER-2
through the dimerization process with them, as we also
found in MCF-7 and SKBR3 cells. HRG1a, 2a, 2b display
the highest expression in breast cancers compared with
other HER ligands and have been correlated with worst
overall survival [47]. It has been shown that HRG1 acts
mainly through HER-3 receptor and may stimulate the
acquisition of cancer stem cell-like characteristics [48].
Additionally, it has been reported that HRG1 (broadly
expressed in the brain), through the formation of HER2:HER-3 heterodimers, increases proliferation potential
and breast cancer cell migration capacity via the brain
microvascular endothelia [49]. HRG can also activate
anchorage-independent breast cancer cell growth more
potently than EGF, whilst the HRG-dependent activation
of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway is
a necessary event for cell transformation [50]. Ligand
specificity dictates the combinatorial formation of certain

combination of trastuzumab and U3 might not have an
additive inhibition in receptor dimerization of HER-2
positive breast cancer cells, and may have competitive
action in HRG-induced receptor dimerization, raising
concerns regarding the ongoing clinical testing of
this combination (NCT01512199). Another important
finding of our study was that the presence of HRG1 did
not suppress U3 inhibitory capacity in HER-2 positive
breast cancer cells. All these in vitro results combined
with the dimerization pattern in HER-2 positive human
breast cancer tissues suggest that HRG1 expression is not
a suitable predictive factor for HER-3 targeting agents,
while the formation of HER-1:HER-4 heterodimer may
represent a potential predictive factor for this class
of agents. Moreover, our in vitro and in vivo results
identified a breast cancer sub-group (HER-2 IHC 1+ / 2+
and FISH negative with high frequency of HER-1:HER-3
heterodimer) that might benefit from HER-3 selective
targeting agents, irrespectively of HRG1 expression.
Nonetheless, it should be noted that the above are only
hypotheses that need to be tested.
A potential drawback of our study relies on the issue
that although HER receptors are membrane proteins there
is growing evidence of nuclear translocation and function
[62], while no cell viability, apoptosis and/or signaling assay
were performed in conjunction with PLA after the various
treatments in order to correlate the dimerization effects with
these assessments in vitro. Full-length nuclear HER-1 is
correlated with transcriptional regulation, DNA replication
and DNA repair. In several tumors HER-1 has been detected
in the nucleus of cancer cells and these patients have a
remarkably poor outcome [63]. HER-3 has been also found
in the nucleus of human mammary epithelial cells, while
HRG1 stimulation can shift HER-3 from the nucleolus to
the nucleus and then to the cytoplasm [64]. In addition, it
has been demonstrated that HRG1-activated nuclear HER-4
receptor stimulates the aggressive behavior of breast tumor
cells [65], which is partially in agreement with our results
regarding the role of HER-4-based dimers. Therefore, HER
expression and dimerization pattern in breast carcinomas
should be further investigated in conjunction with their
subcellular localization.

L-glutamine, fetal bovine serum (FBS) and antibiotics
were purchased from Life Technologies. Both cell lines
were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 2
mmol/L glutamine and antibiotics (100 U/ml penicillinstreptomycin) in a humidified atmosphere of 5% C02 at
37°C.

Reagents
The basic reagents used in our experiments and
their sources are: HRG1-β1 10 μM (R&D Systems),
pertuzumab (P) 30 μM (Genentech), U3 inhibitor 30
μM (U3 Pharma) and trastuzumab (T) 30 μM (Roche).
Primary antibodies anti-EGFR (HER-1) mAb (ab30),
anti-EGFR (HER-1) mAb (103575) and anti-HER-3 mAb
([2F9] 91084) were purchased from Abcam (Abcam,
USA). Anti-HER-2 ([H-200] 134481) and anti-HER-4 ([L20] 31149) mAbs were obtained from Santa Cruz (SCBT,
USA). The DUOLINK In Situ Ligation Kit was purchased
from Olink (DUO92002-Duolink In Situ PLA Probe AntiRabbit PLUS, DUO92004 - Duolink In Situ PLA Probe
Anti-Mouse MINUS, DUO92006 - Duolink In Situ PLA
Probe Anti-Goat MINUS, DUO92007 - Duolink In Situ
Detection Reagents Orange) (Olink Bioscience, Uppsala,
Sweden). Nuclei were stained with TOPRO3 (T3605)
from Life Technologies (Thermo Fisher Scientific).

Proximity ligation assay (PLA)
Proximity ligation assay (PLA) is a method that
retains the dependency of proximal binding of antibodies
and provides a mean for signal amplification [66]. This
technology utilizes DNA oligonucleotides conjugated
to antibodies (proximity probes) to provide a template
for ligation of subsequently added circularization DNA
oligonucleotides. The ligation will only generate circular
products if the proximity probes bind in close proximity.
The length and orientation of the oligonucleotides, as well
as the size of the affinity reagents, determine the distance
requirement for in situ PLA. Once a circular ligation
product is formed, it can be amplified by rolling circle
amplification (RCA). The signal amplification provided
by RCA facilitates detection of single ligation events
[42]. In general, in situ PLA can be used for visualization
of endogenous protein–protein interactions [66], posttranslational modifications [67] as well as protein–nucleic
acid interactions [68, 69], while the generation of discrete
signals facilitates enumeration and analysis by a specific
digital image processing tool. The ability to determine
protein interactions in paraffin-fixed tissue sections may
facilitate the use of these techniques in every day clinical
practice. PLA probes anti-goat PLUS, anti-mouse MINUS
and detection reagent DUOLINK II orange were obtained
from Olink Bioscience.

at least 10 randomly selected fields of view. Data analysis
was done using Duolink Image Tool Software [70].

MCF-7 and SKBR3 cells were cultured on glass
coverslips. After reaching ~80% confluence in culture,
cells were starved overnight and then treated for 48 h.
Subsequently, the cells were fixed with 4% PFA in PBS
for 20 min at room temperature. After permeabilization
for 10 min at room temperature, PLA was performed as
described in the Duolink II protocol using different sets of
primary antibodies (anti-HER-2/HER-3, anti-HER-2/HER4, anti-EGFR (HER-1)/HER-3, anti-EGFR (HER-1)/HER4 and anti-EGFR (HER-1)/EGFR (HER-1)). For controls,
one of the primary antibodies of each set was omitted and
the protocol was carried out without any further changes.
Cells were then incubated with the PLA probes diluted
1:5 in antibody diluent (Olink Bioscience) in a humidified
chamber for 1 h at 37°C. Subsequent hybridization,
ligation, amplification and detection were performed as
per manufacturer’s instructions. Before mounting the glass
coverslips on slides, cells were incubated for 2 min with
TOPRO3 (1:1000 in PBS) for nuclei staining. Finally,
coverslips were mounted with MOWIOL mounting
medium (Sigma Aldrich). Fluorescence images were
acquired using a Zeiss Axiovert microscope (Carl Zeiss
Microscopy, Thornwood, NY USA). For each coverslip,
images were taken from at least 10 randomly selected fields
of view. Data analysis was performed using Duolink Image
Tool Software that has been developed for quantification
of PLA signals (Olink Bioscience) [70]. For statistical
analysis, the resulting “PLA signals per cell” in all groups
were normalized to the mean value of the control group.
Representative images for each condition were prepared
for figure presentation by applying brightness and contrast
adjustments uniformly using Adobe Photoshop CS5.

Ethics statement
All experiments were carried out in accordance with
the guidelines and regulations set by the Ethics Committee
of the Medical School of National and Kapodistrian
University of Athens. Furthermore, the entire study
protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of the
Medical School of National and Kapodistrian University
of Athens and follows the principles of the Declaration of
Helsinki. Informed consent was obtained from all patients.

Data analysis
All experiments were performed at least three times
and data analysis was done using Duolink Image Tool
Software (Olink Bioscience) [70]. For further analysis,
the resulting “PLA signals per cell” in all groups were
normalized to the mean value of the control group.
