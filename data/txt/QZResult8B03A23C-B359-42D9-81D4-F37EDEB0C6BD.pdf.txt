ABSTRACT
A promising new strategy for cancer therapy is to target the autophagic pathway.
In the current study, we demonstrate that the antimalarial drug Quinacrine (QC)
reduces cell viability and promotes chemotherapy-induced cell death in an autophagydependent manner more extensively in chemoresistant cells compared to their
isogenic chemosensitive control cells as quantified by the Chou-Talalay methodology.
Our preliminary data, in vitro and in vivo, indicate that QC induces autophagy by
downregulating p62/SQSTM1 to sensitize chemoresistant cells to autophagicand caspase-mediated cell death in a p53-independent manner. QC promotes
autophagosome accumulation and enhances autophagic flux by clearance of p62 in
chemoresistant ovarain cancer (OvCa) cell lines to a greater extent compared to their
chemosensitive controls. Notably, p62 levels were elevated in chemoresistant OvCa
cell lines and knockdown of p62 in these cells resulted in a greater response to QC
treatment. Bafilomycin A, an autophagy inhibitor, restored p62 levels and reversed
QC-mediated cell death and thus chemosensitization. Importantly, our in vivo data
shows that QC alone and in combination with carboplatin suppresses tumor growth and
ascites in the highly chemoresistant HeyA8MDR OvCa model compared to carboplatin
treatment alone. Collectively, our preclinical data suggest that QC in combination with
carboplatin can be an effective treatment for patients with chemoresistant OvCa.

inducing type II PCD have also been shown to be effective
as anti-cancer agents [3]. Predominant feature of type II
or autophagic cell death is the appearance of doublemembrane vesicles engulfing cytoplasmic organelles which
are eventually degraded by lysosomal hydrolytic enzymes.
Extensive autophagic activity leads eventually to cell death
which, however, differs from the homeostatic autophagy
associated with normal cellular organelle turnover [4].
Under basal cellular conditions, autophagy maintains the
cellular turnover of proteins and organelles via lysosomal
degradation whereas, under nutrient-deprived stress
conditions such as oxidative and/or endoplasmic reticulum
stress [5], it promotes cellular adaptation by supplying
macromolecules for survival [6]. Various strategies have
been investigated to explore the potential of autophagy as
a putative anticancer modality including development of

INTRODUCTION
Ovarian cancer remains a leading cause of death
among women with gynecological cancers despite
significant advances in the systemic as well as surgical
cancer treatment modalities [1]. Ovarian cancer patients
with advanced or recurrent disease frequently develop
chemoresistance against paclitaxel- and platinum-based
therapies which further contributes to disease progression,
recurrence and, ultimately, high mortality [2]. In order to
overcome the shortcomings of standard chemotherapeutic
modalities, several alternative strategies including targeted
therapies, multi-drug combination treatments as well as
drug repurposing are being investigated. Although the
majority of these therapeutic compounds induce apoptosis
through type I programmed cell death (PCD), compounds

chemical inhibitors of autophagy as well as genetic silencing
of key autophagy proteins [7]. Several studies have shown
that inhibiting autophagy using anti-malarial compounds
such as chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine while
combining these compounds with frontline therapeutic
agents such as cisplatin and taxol results in significant
inhibition of tumor growth [8, 9]. Furthermore, other studies
have indicated that drug-induced autophagy promotes
synergy with the frontline therapy [10, 11]. Similarly it
has been shown that genetic silencing of key autophagic
proteins such as beclin 1 (ATG6) favors survival and
decreases resistance to chemotherapy [12–14]. High beclin
1 and LC3 levels in ovarian tumors have been associated
with improved overall survival [15, 16].
The two most common markers and key players
associated with autophagy are LC3B and p62 [17].
Events leading to the conversion of LC3BI to LC3BII
and clearance of p62 are considered hallmarks of the
autophagic flux [18]. The p62 protein, also called
sequestosome 1 (SQSTM1), is an ubiquitin-binding
scaffold protein that co-localizes with ubiquitinated
protein aggregates and is required both for the formation
as well as the degradation of polyubiquitin-containing
bodies by autophagy. p62 binds to LC3B through the
LIR (LC3 Interacting Region) domain and is then
degraded during the autophagic process [19]. Other
studies have shown that elimination of p62 by autophagy
suppresses tumorigenesis [20] in vivo and cell viability
of several human carcinoma cell lines in vitro [21].
Since p62 accumulates when autophagy is inhibited,
and alternatively, p62 levels decrease when autophagy
is induced, p62 surfaces as a promising marker to study
autophagic flux. Selective degradation of p62 is clinically
relevant since high levels of p62 found in various types
of tumor have been associated with poor prognosis and
survival [22]. Studies show that the cisplatin-resistant
SKOV3/DDP OvCa cells express higher levels of p62
and that siRNA downregulation of p62 in these cells
resensitized them to cisplatin-mediated cytotoxicity [23].
Previous investigations have provided evidence
to suggest a promising role of the antimalarial drug
quinacrine (QC) in cancer treatment. The acridine
“backbone” of QC allows the drug to intercalate into
stacked DNA base pairs [24]. QC is known to impair
DNA repair activity in a mechanism similar to other
topoisomerase inhibitors, [25]. In addition, QC inhibits
the FACT (Facilitates Chromatin Transcription) complex
that is required for NF-kB transcriptional activity and
modulates the arachidonic acid (AA) pathway [26].
Interestingly, QC has been shown to bind and inhibit
proteins involved in multidrug resistance [27–32].
More importantly, it targets several signaling pathways
simultaneously by affecting autophagy, apoptosis, p53,
NFkB, AKT and methylation-related pathways [27, 28,
32–35]. While QC has been shown to modulate autophagy
in a p53-dependent manner in colon cancer cell lines,
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

[36] in our study QC induced autophagic cell death in
a p53- independent manner in OvCa cells. Although
QC has been shown to effectively block proliferation of
several cancer cell lines both in vitro and in vivo, to our
knowledge, there are no in vitro or in vivo studies on the
use of QC alone or in combination with standard therapy
against OvCa.
In this study, we have shown that QC promotes
autophagic flux across a variety of OvCa cell lines and
induces cell death both in a caspase-dependent as well
as independent manner utilizing autophagic-mediated
cell death to enhance carboplatin sensitivity. This effect
was more pronounced in cisplatin-resistant OvCA cells
compared to their sensitive controls both in vitro and
in vivo experimental setting. These preclinical data
have direct clinical implications for OvCa patients with
chemoresistant disease for which only limited therapeutic
options exist.
In this study, we focused our investigation on the
anticancer potential of the antimalarial drug QC against
OvCA. Based on prior findings, we hypothesized that
QC would exert its anticancer effect against OvCA by
inducing an autophagic-mediated cell death and that by
doing so it would result in restoring cisplatin-sensitivity.

RESULTS
Quinacrine inhibits cell growth and induces cell
death in ovarian cancer cells
Isogenic pairs of OvCA cell lines [OV2008
(chemosensitive) and C13 (chemoresistant) cells
derived from OV2008 [37]; HEYA8 (chemosensitive)
and HEYA8MDR (chemoresistant) [38, 39] cells] were
evaluated for the effect of QC on cell growth by colony
formation and MTT assays. Colony formation assays
(Figure 1A) were performed after treating the cells with 0,
0.125, 0.250, 0.500, 1.0, and 2.0 μM of QC for 24 hours.
MTT assays (supplemental data) were performed after
treating the cells with 0, 5.0, and 10.0 μM of QC for 24,
48 and 72 hours-time intervals. Increasing concentrations
of QC effectively inhibited colony forming units with
maximal inhibition at a QC concentration of 1.0 and
2.0  μM. Similarly, cell growth was also inhibited as
early as 24 hours of QC treatment with IC50 determined
from the MTT assays in all the cell lines tested were
between 2.5 μM and 4 μM (Figure supplemental S1). To
determine if QC treatment induced apoptotic cell death,
we treated cells with 2.5, 5.0 and 7.5 μM QC for 24 hours
and the apoptotic cell population was determined with
the annexin/PI staining method using flow cytometric
analysis. The apoptotic cell population upon QC treatment
reflecting early and late apoptosis as shown in Figure 1B
indicates that QC only treatment induces apoptosis.
Similarly, western blot analyses of cell lysates of OV2008/

as well as HeyA8/HeyA8MDR cells were treated with

of QC-treated cell lysates was performed using two
different autophagic marker proteins, LC3B and p62.
Figures 2A and 2B show induction of the lipidated form
of LC3B-II in all four cell lines upon QC treatment.
However, QC treatment reduced p62 levels significantly
more in the chemoresistant (C13 and HEYA8MDR) cells
compared to their sensitive counterparts. This induction
of LC3B-II (lower band) and degradation of p62 are
considered hallmarks of autophagic activation [40, 41].
QC treatment resulted in similar effects on p62 and LC3B

Quinacrine induces autophagic clearance
of p62/SQSTM, upregulates the autophagic
marker LC3B and induces apoptosis
Since other antimalarial drugs have previously
been shown to modulate autophagy [36], we tested
whether QC is able to induce autophagy in addition to
promoting apoptosis. Towards this end, OV2008/C13

independent of p53 status in high grade serous cell lines
such as OVCAR3 (p53 mutant) and CAOV3 (p53 null)
(Figure Supplemental S2). To further evaluate QC-induced
autophagy, we utilized transmission electron microscopy
(TEM). TEM analysis of QC-treated OV2008, C13,
HeyA8 and HeyA8MDR cell revealed early autophagic
bodies (autophagosomes) harboring intact organelles [18]
(Figures 2C and 2D). Quantitation of autophagosomes is
shown next to the respective figures. These data suggest
that QC treatment induces autophagy.
While TEM analysis revealed qualitative
and morphological features of autophagy upon QC
treatment, it was unclear whether this represented
increased generation of autophagosome or inhibition of
autophagosomal maturation [42]. Therefore, to further
clarify whether QC induces autophagic flux, OV2008 and
C13 cells were treated with QC in the presence or absence
of a potent late-autophagy inhibitor, bafilomycin A1, and
then  stained  with the autophagolysosome-specific dye
cyto-ID. Cyto-ID retention in the cytoplasm was detected
by flow-cytometric analyses (Figure 2E). This data
indicates that QC's ability to promote autophagy can be
completely inhibited by co-treatment with bafilomycin A1.

LC3B, p62 and apoptotic proteins such as cleaved
PARP upon QC treatment at set time points in C13 and
HeyA8MDR OvCa cells by western blot analysis. Data
in Figure 3C indicate that QC treatment induced p62
downregulation and LC3B upregulation as early as
4 hours post treatment and these levels were sustained
up to 24 hours following treatment. Detection of cleaved
PARP was minimal at 4 hours of treatment; however its
expression increased significantly at 16 hours post QC
treatment. This data suggests that QC treatment triggered
an autophagic response at the earlier time points while this
autophagic response coincided with an apoptosis rate at
later time points it.

QC synergizes with carboplatin in ovarian
cancer cell lines
After observing increased degree of apoptosis upon
QC treatment in chemoresistant OvCa cells, we then
sought to investigate whether QC can synergize with
carboplatin treatment. In order to determine whether QC
synergizes with cisplatin and carboplatin, constant ratio
synergy studies were performed in isogenic cisplatinsensitive OV2008 and cisplatin-resistant C13 cells by
treating them with 1 × IC50 of cisplatin in combination
with 1 × IC50 of QC. We observed that QC had a more
potent synergistic anti-proliferative effect in vitro when
combined with either cisplatin in C13 compared to
OV2008 cells (Figures 4A and 4B). The combination
indices (CI) for the corresponding fractions affected
(FA) are shown in the tables below the figures. CI values
between 0.1–0.3 indicate extremely strong synergism,
0.3–0.7 strong synergism, 0.7–0.85 moderate synergism,
0.85–0.9 slight synergism and 0.9–1.0 a nearly additive
effect. Of note, synergy was demonstrated across nearly
the entire range of the drug concentrations. Similar
studies with isogenic taxol-sensitive SKOV3 and
taxol-resistant SKOV3TR cells [39] indicate that QC
has a more synergistic antiproliferative effect in vitro
when combined with either cisplatin or carboplatin in
SKOV3TR (Figures 4C and 4D) compared to SKOV3
cells. Consistent with this finding, chemoresistant
HeyA8MDR cells showed stronger synergy when
carboplatin was combined with QC compared to the
parent chemosensitive HeyA8 cells (Figures 4E and 4F).
Similar results were obtained with the combination
of carboplatin and QC. Comparison of CI values for
cisplatin and carboplatin are shown Figure Supplemental
figure S4 in a tabular form for OV2002, C13, SKOV3
and SKOV3TR. The IC50 values for QC, cisplatin
and carboplatin in all six cell lines used in synergy
studies are shown in Fig S4. It is important to note that
although the cell lines used in these studies are no longer
considered representative of high grade serous cancers,
they were initially chosen due to the availability of
isogenic chemosensitive and chemoresistant pairs of
OvCA cells.

QC induces autophagic flux and QC-induced
autophagy precedes apoptosis
To further evaluate autophagic flux, we determined
whether QC-mediated upregulation of LC3BII and
downregulation of p62 was affected by co-treatment with
bafilomycin A. Western blot analysis revealed that QC
effectively downregulated p62 expression in C13 and
HeyA8MDR and co-treatment with bafilomycin A protected
autophagic p62 degradation (Figure 3A). No change in p62
mRNA levels was detected upon QC treatment (data not
shown). We next tested whether QC-mediated apoptosis
is dependent on autophagy. OV2008, C13, HEYA8 and
HEYA8MDR cells were treated with QC with or without
bafilomycin A1 followed by annexin/PI staining and flow
cytometric detection of apoptotic cells. QC treatment in
OV2008, C13, HeyA8 and HeyA8MDR cells resulted in
varying but significant increase in annexin V positive cells.
Co-treatment with bafilomycin A completely abolished
QC-mediated annexin V positivity in these cells as shown
in Figure 3B. Consistent with the flow cytometric data,
immunoflourescence analysis also confirmed that the
downregulated p62 by QC were rescued by bafilomycin
treatment in C13 cells (Figure supplemental S3). This
data indicates that QC-promoted cell death is completely
reversed by autophagic inhibitors in all the four cell lines
tested. Taken together, this data suggests that QC induces
apoptosis in an autophagic-dependent manner.
Our data indicates that QC-induces apoptosis and
autophagic inhibition by bafilomycin A. Therefore, we
next sought to determine whether autophagy preceded
the QC-induced apoptotic response. To this end, we
determined the temporal regulation of autophagic proteins

QC-induced autophagy is required for
sensitization to cisplatin-mediated cell death in
OvCa cells

Collectively, these data suggest that QC-induced
autophagy is necessary for resensitization to cisplatininduced cell death in OvCa cells.

In order to test whether QC-induced autophagy
is essential in order to sensitize OvCa cells to cisplatininduced cytotoxicity, we assessed the effects of the
combination of increasing concentrations of cisplatin
with QC (1 × IC50) with and without bafilomycin
A pretreatment in OV2008 and C13 cells. We hypothesized
that by inhibiting autophagy, bafilomycin A will inhibit
the ability of QC to synergize with cisplatin in inducing
autophagic cell death. The cells were pretreated with
50 nM of bafilomycin for 2 hours followed by treatment
with cisplatin and QC. Cell viability was assessed by MTT
assays 48 hours later. As shown in figures  5A  and  5B,
pretreatment with bafilomycin A  (green dotted line)
inhibited the combined QC- and cisplatin-induced
cytotoxicity (blue dotted line). This is also demonstrated by
the change in the CI values from values indicating strong
synergy in C13 (CI = 0.690) and nearly additive effect in
OV2008 (CI = 1.054) without bafilomycin to indicating
antagonism in both C13 (CI = 1.242) and OV2008
(CI = 1.396) after bafilomycin pretreatment (Figure 5C).

p62 knockdown enhances sensitivity to
carboplatin treatment in HeyA8MDR and C13
ovarian cancer cells
Elevated levels of p62 have been previously
shown to be critical in imparting chemoresistance in
OvCA cells [43]. Our data indicate that QC treatment
downregulated p62 levels preferentially in the
chemoresistant C13 and HeyA8MDR cells (Figure 2A).
Previous studies have shown that p62 downregulation
sensitizes cells to cisplatin-mediated cytotoxicity [23].
To determine whether p62 plays role in QC- and
carboplatin-mediated apoptosis, we generated two
different p62 knockdown shRNA clones in HeyA8MDR
and C13 cells as described in Materials and methods
section with non-targeted control transduced cells (NTC)
as controls. Efficient knockdown of p62 was confirmed
in C13 and HeyA8MDR cells by western blot analysis
using anti-p62 antibody (Figures 6A and 6B). To further
evaluate the effect of QC in inducing apoptosis in NTC

and p62-depleted cells, we treated C13 NTC and p62
shRNA clones with 0, 5.0, 10.0 μM of QC for 24 hours.
Evaluation of apoptotic marker proteins by western blot
analysis revealed that p62 knockdown cells exhibited
higher degree of cleaved PARP and caspase 3 whereas
no significant change was observed in LC3B II induction
upon QC treatment in C13 NTC as well as p62shRNA
cells (Figure 6A). Consistent with this data, QC treatment
in HeyA8MDR p62shRNA cells showed increased degree
of caspase 3 and PARP cleavage while no change was
detected in LC3B II induction (Figure 6B). This data
suggests that p62 downregulation in C13 and HeyA8MDR
sensitizes the cells to QC treatment. Similarly, annexin/PI
staining of these cells after treatment with QC revealed
that C13 and HeyA8MDR p62 knockdown cells were
more sensitive to QC-induced cell death when compared
to NTC cells (Figures. 6C and 6D). More importantly,
genetic downregulation of p62 in HeyA8MDR cells
enhanced carboplatin sensitivity (please note the reduction
in carboplatin IC50 from 176 μM in NTC cells to 110 μM
in p62 knockdown cells) (Figure 6E). Collectively, these
findings indicate that p62 downregulation sensitizes cells
to QC-mediated cell death.

(Figure 7E). There was no significant body weight loss
in the QC or combination treatment groups compared to
the untreated control group (Figure 7F). TEM micrographs
of the xenografts showed more autophagosomes (AV in
red, Figure 7G) in the QC group compared to untreated
and carboplatin groups. Combination treatment resulted
in significantly more autophagosomes compared to QC
alone (Figure 7H). H&E staining of the livers from all four
groups (Figure 7I) showed that there was no difference
in histology, suggesting that neither QC monotherapy
nor combination treatment was toxic to the mice. These
data demonstrate that QC plus carboplatin combination
treatment leads to significantly enhanced antitumor
activity in an OvCa mouse model.

DISCUSSION
The lack of effective treatment modalities for
patients with chemoresistant disease continues to pose a
therapeutic challenge in ovarian cancer. There is a growing
need to identify therapeutic compounds which could
promote efficacy to frontline therapeutic agents such as
cisplatin and taxol. In this study, we evaluated the anticancer properties of the anti-malarial drug QC and tested
its effectiveness in combination with carboplatin in OvCa.
QC treatment effectively caused apoptosis and
promoted an autophagic response across a variety of
ovarian cancer cell lines in vitro as well as in vivo in
mouse-derived HeyA8MDR xenografts. QC treatment
caused robust autophagosome formation, LC3B
accumulation and p62 downregulation all of which are
hallmarks of autophagy. Our findings suggest that QCmediated induction of autophagy preceded the induction
of apoptosis as the effects on the autophagic proteins
LC3B and p62 were observed at earlier time points.
Autophagy and apoptosis have been previously shown to
coincide temporarily in order to cause drug-induced cell
death. In agreement with these findings, we showed that
by chemically blocking autophagy using bafilomycin A,
QC-mediated apoptosis was significantly attenuated. At
the molecular level, QC promoted autophagic clearance
of p62 in OvCa cell lines. p62 is a well-known substrate
of autophagy and high levels of p62 have previously been
associated with chemoresistance [23]. Genetic silencing
of p62 expression by shRNA in the chemoresistant
HeyA8MDR cancer cells promoted apoptosis and
enhanced sensitivity to carboplatin (Figure 6E). Therefore,
autophagic clearance of p62 expression by QC might
be one of the underlying mechanisms responsible for
enhanced synergy when QC is combined with carboplatin.
Several studies have shown that p62 expression is elevated
in breast, pancreatic, colon as well as ovarian cancer which
is consistent with our observation of increased expression
of p62 in the chemoresistant cell lines that we studied,
namely the C13 and HeyA8MDR cell line compared to
their chemosensitive counterparts OV2008 and HeyA8.

Quinacrine synergizes with carboplatin in
reducing HeyA8MDR derived mouse tumor
xenografts
QC effectively blocked cell growth, induced
autophagy and apoptosis in OvCa cell lines in vitro. We
next tested whether QC in combination with carboplatin
is effective in attenuating tumor growth in vivo. For this
purpose we utilized HeyA8MDR cells that have capacity
to form tumors when injected intraperitoneally in nude
mice [38]. The effect on tumor growth of QC alone and
in combination with carboplatin (CBP in the Figure 6)
was evaluated in HeyA8MDR in female nude mouse
xenografts. One week after 3×106 HeyA8MDR cells
were injected intraperitoneally in the mice, they were
randomized into four groups of 10 mice when the tumors
were palpable and then treated as shown in Figure 7A.
Quinacrine (150 mg/kg body weight) was given as
described in the materials and methods section. Quinacrine
alone effectively reduced tumor volume and ascites
formation (Figures 6B, 6C and 6D). Although carboplatin
treatment similarly reduced tumor volume, it was
associated with accumulation of ascites to an extent even
greater than untreated controls (Figure 6D). Assessment
of tumor weight and ascites volume as measured at the
time of necropsy across treatment groups showed that
combination treatment was more effective in reducing
cancer progression compared to all other treatment groups
(Figures 7B, 7C and 7D). Staining of the tumors with
Ki-67 showed significantly reduced proliferation in QC
and QC plus carboplatin treated groups, highlighting the
ability of QC to reduce tumor cell proliferation in vivo

QC treatment down regulated p62 expression in an
autophagic-dependent manner in the C13 and HeyA8MDR
OvCa cell lines. Lentiviral shRNA-mediated p62 depletion
in the OV2008 and HeyA8MDR OvCa cell lines resulted
in enhanced synergy between QC and carboplatin. This
data suggests that combination treatment with carboplatin
and QC results in an enhanced QC-mediated clearance
of p62 via autophagy ultimately favoring apoptosis. This
observation is further supported by our data showing
that inhibition of autophagy by bafilomycin A not only
effectively blocked QC-mediated p62 downregulation
but also apoptosis. Being a lysosomotropic agent, it
is not surprising that QC appears to be implicated in
autophagy; however, our study highlights the fact that
p62 downregulation plays a key role in QC-mediated
apoptosis in OvCa cells and provides a description of the
mechanistic interplay between autophagic and apoptotic
cell death upon QC treatment.
QC treatment of mouse-derived xenografts
was shown to be effective in reducing tumor weight,
reducing cell proliferation as measured by Ki-67
staining and blocking ascitic fluid formation. While
a similar degree of tumor reduction was achieved by
carboplatin treatment alone, in contrast to QC treatment,
carboplatin treatment induced ascitic fluid accumulation.
TEM analysis of QC-treated xenografts clearly
showed increased formation of autophagosomes and
autolysosomes. These effects were dramatic when QC was
combined with carboplatin leading to complete remission
of tumor growth and reduction in the proliferation index.
This data is in accordance with the high degree of synergy
observed when chemoresistant OvCa cell lines were
treated with carboplatin and QC in vitro. Taking into
consideration the previously proven ability of carboplatin
to upregulate p62 expression along with the knowledge
that carboplatin-resistant OvCa cells exhibit increased
levels of p62, we hypothesize that co-administration of
QC with carboplatin may mitigate p62 expression in vivo
thereby enhancing the degree of apoptosis.
QC has been shown to stabilize p53, inhibit NF-kB,
and cause cell cycle arrest. However, QC-mediated
p53 stabilization has been associated with its Nf-kB
suppressive activities and not due to genotoxic stress [28].
Our findings revealed that QC induced robust autophagic
cell death and synergized with carboplatin treatment. It is
likely that multiple cellular pathways including p53 and
NF-kB in addition to autophagic p62 downregulation are
playing a role in QC- and carboplatin-mediated synergy.
Other studies have also demonstrated the synergy between
QC and other chemotherapeutic drugs such as Lycopene
in breast cancer [44], cedarinib in glioma cells [45],
vincristine in an MDR sub-clone of K562 cells [31] as
well as other therapeutic compounds [46]. More recently,
quinacrine has been shown to reverse erlotinib resistance
in non-small lung cancer cells by targeting FACT complex
and NF-kB activities [47]. It is important to note that
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

several reports have implicated autophagy as a survival
mechanism in cancer cells and have demonstrated that
by inhibiting autophagy with chloroquine, tumor growth
can be arrested [9]. While this is true at a tumor-specific
level [48], we believe that prolonged chemical inhibition
of autophagy with different autophagic inhibitors might
elicit differential responses than just simply inhibition of
autophagy. Notably, chloroquine, in addition to inhibiting
autophagy, also stabilizes p53 thereby leading to apoptosis.
Similarly, another autophagy inhibitor, 3-MA, has been
shown to inhibit Akt activation [49]. These observations
in conjunction with our data indicate that drugs altering
autophagy may also influence apoptosis. QC unlike
Bafilomycin A promoted p62 degradation as a function
of autophagy induction and also promoted apoptosis both
in vitro and in vivo.
In summary, the present study demonstrated that
QC treatment resulted in autophagic clearance of p62,
promoted apoptosis and effectively synergized with
carboplatin in vivo. QC's ability to inhibit multiple
pathways simultaneously in addition to promoting
autophagic cell death offers compelling evidence to
support the hypothesis that it may represent an important
adjunct to standard treatment against ovarian cancer
especially in patients with chemoresistant disease.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell lines, chemicals and antibodies
The human OvCa cell lines SKOV3, SKOV3 TR,
HeyA8 and HeyA8 MDR were obtained on an MTA from
MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX. C13 and
OV2008, were obtained on a MTA from Dr. Barabara
Vanderhyden (Ottawa Hospital Research Institute,
Ottawa, Canada). OVCAR3 and CAOV3 were obtained
from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC)
(Manassas, VA). All cell lines were cultured according to
the providers' recommendations at5% CO2 and at 37°C.
Quinacrine was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. MTT dye
was obtained from Promega. Carboplatin was purchased
from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA). Anti-LC3B, antiPARP, anti-p62, anti-PDI and anti GAPDH antibodies
were purchased from Cell Signaling Corporation. AntiNBR antibody was purchased from Genetex. Anti-p53
(DO-1) antibody is from Santa Cruz Biotech.

Colony formation assay
500 cells were plated in 6-well plates and treated
with increasing concentrations of QC (0.12, 0.25, 0.5,
1.0 1nd 2.0, 2.0 μM) for 24 hrs. The media was replaced
after day1. Colonies were fixed in methanol and stained
with 0.5% crystal violet [50] on day 8 and counted using a
colony counting software, Quantity One (Bio-Rad). Each
treatment was carried out in triplicate and repeated twice.

Cytotoxicity assay

Flow cytometric analysis of apoptosis
and autophagy

MTT assay was performed in order to assess the
effect of QC on OvCa cell lines. Ten thousand cells from
each cell line were treated with various concentrations
of QC and carboplatin separately or in combination
for 48 hours followed by a 4-hour period of incubation
with 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (MTT). The violet formazan crystals were
dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and the absorbance
was measured at 490 nm in a microplate reader.

C13 and OV2008 cells were treated with the
indicated doses of QC, then harvested and resuspended
in a binding buffer. Cells were then stained with Annexin
V-pacific blue and Propidium iodide (BD bioscience)
according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were
analyzed in a Beckman Coulter EPICS XL/MCL flow
cytometer (Beckman-Coulter Fullerton, CA, USA) and
the data were analyzed with Flowjo Software (Tree Star,
Ashland, OR, USA). Cyto-IDTM (Enzo Life Sciences) is a
dye specifically labeling the autophagic vacuoles in a cell
by colocalizing with LC3B. After treating the cells with
various concentrations of QC, cells were collected and
stained using Cyto-ID dye according to the manufacturer's
instructions. Cells were analyzed as previously described
in a Beckman Coulter EPICS XL/MCL flow cytometer
(Beckman-Coulter Fullerton, CA, USA) and the data
were analyzed with Flowjo Software (Tree Star, Ashland,
OR, USA).

ShRNA transductions
The control shRNA, pTRC1-NTC (non-target
shRNA vector, Sigma) contains a hairpin insert that will
generate siRNAs but contains five base pair mismatches to
any known human gene. shRNA for p62/SQSTM denoted
as p62-sh280 was purchased from Sigma and with a
sequence CGAGGAATTGACAATGGCCAT targeting
cDNA region of p62. Lentivirus particles were produced
by transient transfection of pTRC1-NTC and pTRC1-p62
shRNA along with packaging vectors (pVSV-G and
pGag/pol) in 293T cells. The lentiviral supernatants were
collected 48 hours after transduction, filtered and either
used for infection or stored at -80°C. Vector titers were
determined by transducing OvCa cells with serial dilutions
of concentrated lentivirus, in complete growth medium
containing 8 μg/ml polybrene (Invitrogen). After 7 days,
the growth medium was supplemented with puromycin
(2  μg/ml) for selection. The surviving colonies were
counted under the microscope and the titer of lentiviral
stocks was calculated using the formula: Transducing
units = number of colonies × lentiviral dilution. All
lentiviral stocks used in the study were selected at a
multiplicity of infection of 10.

Western blot analysis
Western blot analysis was performed as previously
described [51, 54].

Transmission electron microscopy
Cells (2 × 106) were treated with QC and then
harvested and centrifuged at 1200 r.p.m. for 5 minutes.
Cell samples were then pre-fixed with Trumps buffer.
The images were taken using a Philips 208S electron
microscope (FEI Corporation, Eindhoven, Netherlands).

Immunofluorescence

MTT assay, synergy assessment and
Chou-Talalay calculations

Cells were plated on coverslips and treated with
QC as indicated in materials and methods. Cells were
fixed with 100% methanol followed by blocking with
1% BSA in PBS. Cells were then incubated with the
corresponding primary antibodies at room temperature for
1 hour followed by three washes with 1X PBS and then
incubated in the dark with Alexa fluor rabbit anti-mouse
(593 nm) in 1% BSA in PBS. Coverslips were washed
three times before mounting with Prolong Gold Antifade
reagent (Invitrogen). Stained samples were visualized
using a Zeiss-LSM 510 fluorescence microscope.

Cell lines were treated with a wide range of
concentrations of QC and cisplatin for 48 hours and the
half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of each
drug alone was derived experimentally by MTT assay
as previously described [51] and calculated by Prism
(GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA). Subsequently, drug
combination studies (QC with cisplatin and QC with
carboplatin) were performed and their synergy was
quantified using the Chou-Talalay method as previously
described in the literature [52, 53]. Both constant ratio
synergy (ratio of drugs 1:1) studies were carried out.
Synergy was assessed by creating combination indices
(CI): CI values less than 0.9 indicate synergism, CI
values between 0.9 to 1.1 indicate nearly additive
effect and CI values greater than 1.1 indicate
antagonism [52].

Animal studies
Athymic nude mice were purchased from
Harlan. 3 × 106 HEYA8MDR cells were injected
intraperitoneally. Treatment was initiated after one week
following the intraperitoneal inoculation of the cells.
Stock solutions of QC (Sigma) were prepared in sterile

water and administered by oral gavage. Carboplatin
(Hospira pharma) were injected intraperitoneally. Before
initiation of treatment, animals were randomly assigned to
one of four groups (10 mice per group). The control group
received water by oral gavage the QC only group received
150 mg/kg body weight of QC every other day starting
on day 7, the carboplatin group received carboplatin
by intraperitoneal injection at a dose of 50 mg/kg body
weight) on days 7, 14, 21 and 28 and the combination
group received carboplatin by intraperitoneal injection at
days 7, 14, 21 and 28 and QC at 150 mg/kg body weight
starting on day 7, then every other day until the end of the
study. All animals were sacrificed on day 28. Animal care
and procedures was conducted according to institutional
policies and the experimental protocol was approved by
the IACUC committee of our Institution.
