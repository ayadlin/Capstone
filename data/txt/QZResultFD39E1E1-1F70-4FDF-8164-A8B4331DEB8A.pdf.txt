Abstract
Hallmark deregulated signaling in cancer cells drives excessive ribosome biogenesis within the nucleolus, which elicits
unbridled cell growth and proliferation. The rate-limiting step
of ribosome biogenesis is synthesis of rRNA (building blocks of
ribosomes) by RNA Polymerase I (Pol I). Numerous kinase
pathways and products of proto-oncogenes can up-regulate
Pol I, whereas tumor suppressor proteins can inhibit rRNA
synthesis. In tumorigenesis, activating mutations in certain
cancer-associated kinases and loss-of-function mutations in
tumor suppressors lead to deregulated signaling that stimulates Pol I transcription with resultant increases in ribosome
biogenesis, protein synthesis, cell growth, and proliferation.
Certain anticancer therapeutics, such as cisplatin and 5fluorouracil, reportedly exert, at least partially, their activity
through disruption of ribosome biogenesis, yet many prime
targets for anticancer drugs within the ribosome synthetic
machinery of the nucleolus remain largely unexploited.
Herein, we describe CX-3543, a small molecule nucleolustargeting agent that selectively disrupts nucleolin/rDNA Gquadruplex complexes in the nucleolus, thereby inhibiting
Pol I transcription and inducing apoptosis in cancer cells.
CX-3543 is the first G-quadruplex interactive agent to enter
human clinical trials, and it is currently under evaluation
against carcinoid/neuroendocrine tumors in a phase II
clinical trial. [Cancer Res 2009;69(19):7653–61]

Introduction
The availability of ribosomes is a key regulator of cell growth and
proliferation (reviewed in ref. 1). Ribosome biogenesis occurs in the
nucleolus and is carefully controlled by multiple cell signaling
pathways that converge on the RNA Polymerase I complex (Pol I).
Pol I is directly responsible for transcription of rRNA genes to
generate pre-rRNAs that are processed to mature rRNA molecules,
the key building blocks of ribosomes (reviewed in ref. 2). Because
rRNA synthesis is the rate-limiting step of ribosome biogenesis (3),
Pol I is highly regulated (reviewed in ref. 4), and many of its
regulators play critical roles in cancer (reviewed in refs. 5–8).
Deregulated signaling by proto-oncogenes and tumor suppressors
activates Pol I to accelerate ribosome biogenesis and support rapid
cell proliferation of cancer cells (9–12). The link between nucleolar
hypertrophy and tumorigenesis has been recognized for more

than a century (13). More recent data show that a marked increase
in rRNA synthesis is a general phenomenon in cancer, that the rate
of cancer cell proliferation in tumors is directly proportional to
nucleolar size and Pol I activity, and that overexpression of prerRNA correlates with an adverse prognosis in cancer (14, 15).
Although several approved anticancer therapeutics have been
shown to inhibit rRNA biogenesis (16, 17), there are currently no
approved agents that specifically target Pol I transcription. Low
concentrations of actinomycin D have been shown to preferentially
inhibit rRNA synthesis over mRNA synthesis. However, its
selectivity is questionable as it affects other cellular processes,
such as the maturation of mRNA, at the same concentrations
(18). Thus, structures and processes of the rRNA synthesis
pathway represent important, but largely unexploited, targets for
anticancer drugs.
Human ribosomal DNA (rDNA) is GC rich. It contains >400
copies of the rRNA genes, organized in tandem arrays on five
different human chromosomes (reviewed in ref. 4). Transcription of
G-rich templates, such as rDNA, is accompanied by the formation
of G-quadruplex DNA structures in nontemplate strands (19).
These structures can prevent renaturation of the template DNA,
thereby promoting the dense spacing of Pol I molecules on rRNA
genes, which is characteristic of rapidly transcribing rDNA (it can
be as high as one Pol I per 41 nucleotides; ref. 20). Indeed,
treatment of yeast with a G-quadruplex–targeting porphyrin
selectively down-regulates rRNA expression, indicating the formation of G-quadruplexes in rDNA in vivo as well as their potential
role in rRNA biogenesis (21). Nucleolin, an abundant nucleolar
protein (22), is associated with rDNA in vivo and is absolutely
required for rRNA synthesis, as its knockdown was shown to
specifically inhibit Pol I–driven transcription (23, 24). Nucleolin
possesses nanomolar affinities for such G-quadruplex structures
(25) and thus may bind to and further stabilize them to increase
the rate of Pol I transcription. Thus, targeting nucleolin/rDNA Gquadruplex complexes to inhibit aberrant Pol I transcription in
cancer cells represents a novel, nucleolus targeting approach to
selectively disrupt proliferation of cancer cells.
Extensive research efforts identified CX-3543 (also known as
quarfloxin; Fig. 1A), a small molecule fluoroquinolone derivative
that targets and disrupts nucleolin/rDNA G-quadruplex complexes.
Fluoroquinolone antibiotics bind duplex DNA and inhibit bacterial
gyrase, inducing selective cytotoxicity in bacterial cells (26).
Similarly, CX-3543 binds to G-quadruplex DNA and was shown to
selectively disrupt interaction of rDNA G-quadruplexes with the
nucleolin protein thereby inhibiting Pol I transcription and
inducing apoptotic death in cancer cells.

Figure 1. CX-3543 concentrates in the nucleoli of
cancer cells. A, structure of CX-3543. B, A549 lung
carcinoma cells were treated with 5 Amol/L CX-3543 for
1 h, washed, and visualized using Olympus IX2 series
microscope with open channel UV filter and 60 objective.

25 mmol/L phosphate buffer (pH 6) was stored at room temperature in the
dark. The drug was diluted directly in growth media before treatment.
Cell lines. Lung carcinoma A549 cells, colorectal adenocarcinoma
HCT-116 cells, breast adenocarcinoma MDA-MB-231 cells, breast adenocarcinoma MCF7 cells, pancreatic carcinoma MIA PaCa-2 cells, and acute
promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 were purchased from American Tissue
Culture Collection.
Circular dichroism analysis of rDNA PQSs. Oligonucleotides
corresponding to PQSs from the nontemplate strand of rDNA were
purchased from Invitrogen, denatured at 100jC for 5 min, and gradually
brought to ambient temperature in the presence of potassium ions. The
circular dichroism spectra of G-quadruplexes were measured with Jasco
J-810 Spectropolarimeter. The G-quadruplexes with a spectrum containing
a positive maximum at 260 nm were deemed as predominantly parallel,
whereas G-quadruplexes with a spectrum containing a positive maximum
at 295 nm were deemed as predominantly antiparallel. Those that exhibited
both features were assigned a mixed conformation.
Interaction of nucleolin protein with rDNA G-quadruplexes and
competition by CX-3543. rDNA G-quadruplexes were labeled with 32P at
the 5¶-end using T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs). Affinity of

various G-quadruplexes for recombinant human nucleolin (a kind gift of
Dr. Maizels, University of Washington, Seattle, WA) was measured by filterbinding assay. In summary, 0.1 nmol/L of 32P-labled rDNA quadruplex was
incubated for 30 min at ambient temperature with 0.3 to 30 nmol/L of
nucleolin in a binding buffer containing 12.5 mmol/L Tris (pH 7.6),
60 mmol/L KCl, 1 mmol/L MgCl2, 0.1 mmol/L EDTA, 5% glycerol, and
100 Ag/mL bovine serum albumin (BSA). The resulting complexes were
filtered through mixed cellulose ester membranes (Millipore). The
membranes were washed thrice, dried, and counted in a Microbeta Trilux
2 detection system (Perkin-Elmer). Dissociation constants (Kd) were
calculated using GraphPad Prism software (GraphPad Software). For the
competition studies, a mix of 5 nmol/L of 32P-labeled rDNA G-quadruplex
and 10 nmol/L nucleolin were incubated in binding buffer 30 min at
ambient temperature with 0.3 to 30 Amol/L CX-3543. The resulting
complexes were resolved using Novex Tris-borate EDTA DNA retardation
PAGE (Invitrogen). The gels were dried and exposed to X-ray film (Kodak).
Inhibition constants were calculated using the Cheng-Prusoff equation:
K i = IC50/(1+N/K d), where K i is inhibition constant, IC50 is a median
inhibition concentration, N is the concentration of nucleolin, and K d is a
dissociation constant for the nucleolin/rDNA G-quadruplex complex.

and FISH using antinucleolin mouse monoclonal antibody
coupled with Cy3-labeled secondary antibody (red) and
Alexa-488–labeled probe that hybridizes to 5¶-external
transcribed spacer (5¶-ETS ) of short-lived pre-rRNA
(green ). Cellular nuclei were stained with Hoescht 33342
(blue ) and cells were visualized with Zeiss Axiovert 200
microscope using 40 objective. C, A549 cells, untreated
or treated for 4 h with 10 Amol/L CX-3543, were washed,
fixed, and analyzed by FISH using Alexa-488 labeled probe
that hybridizes to 5¶-external transcribed spacer (green )
and Cy3-labeled probe that hybridizes to internal

pre-rRNA. Cellular nuclei were stained with Hoescht 33342
(blue ) and cells were visualized with Zeiss Axiovert 200
microscope using 40 objective.

Immunocytochemistry. A549 cells were plated in F12 media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum on poly-L-lysine coated slides (EMS).
After overnight incubation, cells were treated with indicated doses of drugs
for specified periods of time. After treatment, cells were washed twice with
PBS, fixed for 10 min in 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS, washed twice again with
PBS and permeabilized for 10 min in 100% ethanol, washed thrice with PBS,
blocked for 30 min with 5% donkey serum (Invitrogen) in PBS with 0.05%
Tween 20, and incubated 1 h with either 1:500 dilution of mouse monoclonal
antinucleolin antibody (Stressgen), 1:100 dilution of rabbit polyclonal anti–
cleaved caspase-3 or rabbit polyclonal anti-fibrillarin antibody (Cell Signaling
Technology) in 5% donkey serum (Invitrogen). Then cells washed thrice for
5 min with PBS; incubated for 30 min with 1:100 dilution of Cy3-linked goat
anti-mouse secondary antibody, FITC-, or Cy3-linked goat anti-rabbit
secondary antibody (Invitrogen); washed thrice for 15 min with PBS; and
visualized on a Zeiss Axiovert 200 fluorescence microscope (Zeiss).
Fluorescent in situ hybridization. A549 cells were incubated overnight
on poly-L-lysine–coated slides then treated with indicated doses of CX-3543
for specified periods of time. Cells then were washed twice with PBS, fixed
for 10 min in 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS (pH 8.0) at room temperature,
washed twice again with PBS, and permeabilized for 10 min in 100%
ethanol. Cells then were washed twice with 10% formamide in 2  SSC
buffer and hybridized for 3 h at 37jC with 2.5 ng/AL of fluorescently labeled
probe that hybridizes to the 5¶-external transcribed spacer (5¶-/Alexa488(or

for 5 min with 10% formamide in 2 SSC buffer and once with PBS followed
by the incubation for 5 min with 1 Amol/L solution of Hoescht 33342 in PBS.
Then the cells were washed twice with PBS and visualized on Zeiss Axiovert
200 fluorescence microscope (Zeiss,).
Chromatin immunoprecipitation. A549 cells were seeded at 1.5  106
cells per 150-mm plate 1 d before 2-h treatment with 10 Amol/L with CX3543. The assays were then carried out as described previously (27) with the
following modifications. The nuclear lysate was sonicated to generate 200 to
500 bp chromatin fragments. For each immunoprecipitation, the precleared
lysate (equivalent to f3  106 cells) was incubated with 4 AL of rabbit
nonimmune serum or rabbit serum against UBF or TATA binding protein or
1.5 Ag of antinucleolin rabbit polyclonal antibody (Novus Biologicals)
overnight at 4jC. PCR was performed in 50 AL of reaction mixture
containing 4 AL of DNA, 25 AL of 2  SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied
Biosystems), and 250 nmol/L primers. Accumulation of fluorescent product
was monitored by real-time PCR using 7900HT Real-time PCR System
(Applied Biosystems). The sequences of primers used in the PCR are as
follows: 48, 5¶-CCCGGGGGAGGTATATCTTT-3¶ and 5¶-CCAACCTCTCCGACGACA-3¶; +2907, 5¶-GACGTGTGGCGTGGGTCGAC-3¶and 5¶-GACGGGAGGCAGCGACCGG-3¶; +5645, 5¶-GTTCGCTCGCTCGTTCGTTC-3¶ and 5¶CAACGACACGCCCTTCTTTC-3¶; and +12855, 5-ACCTGGCGCTAAACCATTCGT -3 and 5-GGACAAACCCTTGTGTCGAGG-3. A series of dilutions
of input DNA were run alongside the chromatin immunoprecipitation
samples to establish the standard curve for each pair of primers. The
background from the control reaction (nonimmune serum) was <0.0001% of
input chromatin and was subtracted from the data of the sample reactions.

Laboratories) were ear punched for identification and housed four per cage
in ventilated microisolator cages maintained under pathogen-free conditions. Animals were provided ad libitum access to irradiated food and
autoclaved water. Animal experiments were performed in accordance with
approved standard operating protocols of Cylene Pharmaceuticals that
were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. MDAMB-231 and MIA PaCa-2 cells were obtained from American Type Culture
Collection and cultured according to recommended specifications. Mice
were inoculated with 1  107 cells per mouse in a 50% growth media/50%
Matrigel (BD Bioscences) mixture directly into the inguinal mammary fat
pad (MDA-MB-231) or 5  106 in 100 AL of cell suspension subcutaneouly in
the right flank (MIA PaCa-2). Tumor measurements were performed by
caliper, and tumor volume was calculated using the formula (l  w 2)/2,
where w is width and l is length in mm of the tumor. Established tumors

(>125 mm3) were randomized into vehicle (5% dextrose in water) or
CX-3543 treatment groups. For the MDA-MB-231 model, CX-3543 (6.25 or
12.5 mg/kg) was administered via i.v. injection according to a 5-2-5 regimen
(5-d treatment with 2-d rest) for 37 d. In MIA PaCa-2 xenografts, CX-3543
(5 mg/kg) was administered i.v. once daily for 13 d followed by 7 d of rest,
followed by an additional 5 d of treatment.

Results
CX-3543 disrupts nucleolin/G-quadruplex complexes on
rDNA. Several reports have quantified the prevalence of putative
G-quadruplex forming sequences (PQS) in nonrepetitive regions of
the human genome (28–30). To evaluate this potential for PQS in the
repetitive and G-rich rDNA, we designed a search algorithm
(quad_find; see Supplementary Materials and Methods) that
identified 14 PQS in the nontemplate strand of each human rRNA
gene (Table 1). Circular dichroism analysis of oligonucleotides
corresponding to these PQS confirmed that all could form Gquadruplex structures of the parallel, antiparallel, or mixed
conformations (Supplementary Fig. S1A; Table 1). Of the 14 PQS in
the nontemplate strand of rDNA, all but three formed complexes with
nucleolin characterized by Kd of <2 nmol/L, with six having Kd of <1
nmol/L. Interestingly, nucleolin exhibited selectivity for quadruplexes
with parallel or mixed conformations. CX-3543 disrupted all but one
of the identified nucleolin/G-quadruplex complexes with submicromolar inhibition constants (Ki), as determined by electrophoretic
mobility shift assays (Supplementary Fig. S1B and C; Table 1), but did
not interfere with the interaction between nucleolin and its other
known ligand, hairpin RNA (Supplementary Fig. S1C; ref. 31).
CX-3543 accumulates in nucleoli of cancer cells, and causes
redistribution of nucleolin followed by inhibition of rRNA
synthesis. CX-3543 is a fluorescent molecule with excitation

maximum at 350 nm and emission maximum at 550 nm. Using
fluorescence microscopy, we observed that CX-3543 rapidly accumulates in the nucleoli of A549 lung carcinoma cells (see
Supplementary Materials and Methods; Fig. 1B). To determine the
effects of CX-3543 on intracellular localization of nucleolin and rRNA
synthesis, we used a combination of immunocytochemistry and
fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) analyses. The 28S, 18S, and
5.8S rRNAs are initially transcribed as one short-lived 47S pre-rRNA
precursor (Fig. 2A). Because the half-life of mature rRNAs is very
long, we designed probes that hybridize to external or internal
transcribed spacers within pre-rRNA to measure the effect of drugs
on Pol I transcription. Two-hour treatment of the cells with CX-3543
was accompanied by a dramatic relocalization of nucleolin from
nucleoli to the nucleoplasm of treated cells (Fig. 2B, left and center
top). Certain drugs, such as actinomycin D, can intercalate into

GC-rich regions of rDNA and also trigger the relocalization of
nucleolin by inhibiting rRNA synthesis (32); in that case, a loss of
staining for pre-rRNA in the nucleolus of A549 cells sequentially
precedes the relocalization of nucleolin from the nucleolus to the
nucleoplasm (e.g., Fig. 2B, right). In contrast, CX-3543–treated A549
cells showed nucleolin redistribution before a loss of pre-rRNA (e.g.,
Fig. 2B, center). Although inhibition of rRNA synthesis by CX-3543
was evident after 2-hour treatment (data not shown), 4-hour
treatment resulted in complete depletion of pre-rRNA species from
A549 cells (Fig. 2C). Certain types of cellular stress, such as treatment
with camptothecin, can also affect the localization of nucleolin in
p53-expressing cells (33). CX-3543 was able to redistribute nucleolin
in the p53-null human osteosarcoma cell line Saos-2 (Supplementary
Fig. S2), indicating that this relocalization is not a p53-mediated
stress response but rather a result of the direct action of CX-3543.

Anticancer Activity of CX-3543

To test the selectivity of CX-3543 on disruption of nucleolin/
rDNA G-quadruplex complexes relative to other nucleolar proteins/rDNA interactions, we used chromatin immunoprecipitation.
Interrogation of three PQS-containing regions in the rDNA showed
that treatment of A549 cells with CX-3543 caused nearly complete
dissociation of nucleolin from all of them, whereas having little
effect on the occupancy of nucleolin at the rDNA promoter or on
the interaction of UBF or the TATA binding protein with the rDNA
(Fig. 3A). The selectivity of CX-3543 toward nucleolin was
supported by immunofluorescence analysis that showed CX-3543
can redistribute nucleolin without having any major effect on
localization of another nucleolar protein, fibrillarin (Fig. 3B).
CX-3543 selectively inhibits rRNA synthesis by interfering
with the elongation step of Pol I transcription. To test if
CX-3543–mediated disruption of nucleolin/rDNA G-quadruplex complexes inhibits elongation of Pol I-driven transcription, we evaluated
the effect of CX-3543 on the synthesis of rRNA by nuclear run-on assay.
Isolated nuclei cannot initiate RNA synthesis de novo, and thus,
all RNA synthesis that occurs in them is the result of the elongation
of transcripts by RNA polymerases that already have initiated
transcription (34). Inclusion of a-amanitin in the assay inhibits
RNA Polymerases II and III (35) and thus allows the evaluation of
the effects specific to elongation by Pol I. In the presence of aamanitin, CX-3543 showed concentration-dependent inhibition of
transcription in isolated nuclei with IC50 of 3.3 Amol/L (Fig. 4A).
The selectivity of CX-3543 toward the inhibition of RNA
synthesis over DNA and protein synthesis was shown by studies
measuring the incorporation of tritiated precursors in cells. In
short, colorectal adenocarcinoma cells HCT 116 were treated for 2
hours with 1 Amol/L of CX-3543 or aphidicolin, actinomycin D, and
cyclohexemide as controls, and the effects on [3H]-uridine, [3H]thymidine, and [3H]-methionine incorporation were measured. As
can be seen from Fig. 4B, treatment with 1 Amol/L of CX-3543
resulted in f50% reduction in incorporation of [3H]-uridine,
whereas having no or little effect on [3H]-thymidine and [3H]methionine uptake, indicating that CX-3543 preferentially inhibits
RNA synthesis over DNA and protein synthesis. In contrast,
another quadruplex-interacting compound BRACO-19, which is
known to interfere with telomere function, was previously shown
to preferentially inhibit DNA synthesis over RNA synthesis (36),
supporting the notion that discrete G-quadruplex–binding
pharmacophores may have alternative mechanisms of action.
In addition to rRNA genes, transcription of several oncogenes
(including bcl-2, c-myb, c-myc, and k-ras) is thought to be
controlled by formation of G-quadruplexes (37–40), and certain
G-quadruplex–binding compounds were shown to modulate the
transcription of these genes through stabilization of quadruplexes
(38, 41). In contrast, although treatment of A549 cells with CX-3543
resulted in the dose-dependent suppression of rRNA synthesis with
an IC50 of 1.8 Amol/L, it had no inhibitory effect on the RNA
Polymerase II-driven transcription of bcl-2, c-myb, c-myc, and k-ras
mRNAs (Fig. 4C).
CX-3543 does not cause cellular effects associated with
telomere dysfunction. Although the majority of quadruplex-

binding compounds are thought to exhibit their biological activity
through the interference with telomerase function (reviewed in
ref. 42), CX-3543 caused no cellular effects that are generally
associated with telomeric dysfunction. Short-term (48 hours)
treatment of A549 cells with a cytotoxic dose (1 Amol/L) of
CX-3543 (IC50, 0.4 Amol/L at 48 hours) did not cause telomeric
fusions, polynucleated cells, or anaphase bridges, whereas prolonged exposure (16 days) of MCF7 breast carcinoma cell line
that possess short telomeres (43), to subcytotoxic concentrations
(200 nmol/L) of CX-3543 (IC50, 1.3 Amol/L at 48 hours) had no
effect on cell proliferation (Supplementary Fig. S3).
CX-3543 does not interfere with Topoisomerase I/II function
in cells. Because certain fluoroquinolone-based agents were shown
to interfere with Topoisomerase function (26), we evaluated the
effect of CX-3543 on Topoisomerase activity. In a cell-free
Topoisomerase II poisoning assay, as high as 100 Amol/L of CX3543 had no effect on cleavable complex formation (data not
shown), indicating that CX-3543 is not a Topoisomerase II poison.
Both Topoisomerase I and II are known to participate in DNA
replication (reviewed in ref. 44) and thus it is plausible to propose
that drugs that interfere with Topoisomerase I/II function will have
an effect on DNA synthesis. To test this, we evaluated the effects of
CX-3543 or three controls, Irinotecan (Topoisomerase I poison),
Mitoxantrone (Topoisomerase II poison), and Merbarone (Topoisomerase II catalytic inhibitor) on DNA synthesis and cell
viability in A549 cells (see Supplementary Materials and Methods).
The data presented in Supplementary Fig. S4 shows that all
controls inhibited DNA synthesis at concentrations below those
that had significant effects on cell viability. This means that
poisoning of Topoisomerase I or Topoisomerase II, or even simple
inhibition of Topoisomerase II catalytic activity results in the
inhibition of DNA synthesis without immediate concomitant
effects on cell viability. In contrast, the reduction in DNA synthesis
by CX-3543 was only evident at concentrations where CX-3543
severely affected cell viability and hence was secondary to the
antiproliferative effects of the drug. These data show that CX-3543
does not interfere with Topoisomerase I/II function in cells.
CX-3543 induces apoptosis in cancer cells. Inhibition of rRNA
synthesis in cancer cell lines is known to cause nucleolar stress that
results in disintegration of nucleoli and subsequent activation of
the p53 response and apoptosis (45). Additionally, in a p53-null
environment inhibition of rRNA synthesis can still produce an
apoptotic response indicating the presence of compensatory
pathways (46). As expected, the inhibition of rRNA synthesis
by CX-3543 led to stabilization of p53 (data not shown) that
was followed by induction of apoptosis, as judged by nuclear
shrinkage, caspase-3 activation, cleavage of poly ADP ribose
polymerase (PARP), and induction of chromatin DNA laddering
(Supplementary Fig. S5). Interestingly, just like actinomycin D,
CX-3543 was able to induce apoptotic response in p53-null cell line
HL-60 (Supplementary Fig. S5C). In addition to stabilization of p53,
treatment with actinomycin D was shown to induce phosphorylation of histone H2AX at Ser139 (g-H2AX; ref. 47). The authors
proposed that this event is mediated by kinase DNA-PK that in

such case may serve as a sensor for stalled transcriptional bubbles.
Alternatively, the g-H2AX induction can be a result of DNA
damage, because Actinomycin D was previously shown to induce
DNA double-stranded breaks (48). Because the inhibition of Pol I
elongation by CX-3543 should result in stalled transcription
bubbles, we investigated the effects of CX-3543 on the phosphorylation status of H2AX. Whereas 4-hour treatment of A549 cells
with 5 Amol/L of CX-3543 did not change the phosphorylation
status of H2AX (data not shown), 8-hour treatment with the same
dose resulted in a marked increase in phosphorylation of H2AX at
Ser139 (Supplementary Fig. S6). Two-hour pretreatment of cells
with a selective inhibitor of DNA-PK, AMA37, failed to prevent this
phosphorylation, indicating that DNA-PK is not a major mediator
of the CX-3543–triggered g-H2AX induction. In addition to
inhibition of transcription, cellular g-H2AX levels can increase as
a result of direct DNA damage, telomere injury, or apoptosis-driven
DNA fragmentation (49, 50). CX-3543 tested negative in Ames
and chromosome aberration genotoxicity assays and, as shown
above, had no effect on Topoisomerase I/II function, indicating
that the increase of g-H2AX levels by CX-3543 does not result
from the direct DNA damage. Several other quadruplex-binding
compounds are known to induce DNA damage–like response
through telomere injury (49, 51). Such telomere damage is usually
associated with nuclear abnormalities (52, 53), which we did
not observe in cells treated with CX-3543 (Supplementary Fig. S3),
making this an unlikely explanation for the observed phenomenon.
One other possibility is that g-H2AX induction by CX-3543
results from apoptosis-driven DNA fragmentation (50). Induction
of apoptosis was evident in A549 cells treated for 8 hours
with 5 Amol/L of CX-3543, as judged by PARP cleavage. Two-hour
preincubation of cells with 50 Amol/L of pan-caspase inhibitor
Z-VAD(OMe)-FMK was able to suppress caspase activation,
blocking the cleavage of PARP and also inhibiting the induction
of g-H2AX by CX-3543 (Supplementary Fig. S6). This result
indicates that phosphorylation of H2AX in cells treated with CX3543 is most likely due to double-stranded DNA breaks introduced
by caspase-activated DNase, and thus is secondary to the induction
of the apoptosis by the drug.
CX-3543 exhibits broad antiproliferative activity in vitro.
When evaluated against 80 cell lines representing an expansion
of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) 60 cell panel, CX-3543
was found to exert a broad range of in vitro antiproliferative
activity (see Supplementary Materials and Methods; Fig. 5A).
COMPARE analysis of these data3 indicates a unique mode of
action for CX-3543, as the range of action profile, does not correlate
with any compound in the current NCI database. Moreover,
cancer cell lines overexpressing MDR1, MXR, or MRP1 drug
resistance transporter genes retained sensitivity to CX-3543,
indicating CX-3543 is not a substrate for these multidrug resistance
pumps (Fig. 5A).
CX-3543 exhibits antitumor activity in vivo. A broad range
of antitumor activity was observed in vivo in murine xenograft
models of multiple human cancers, including breast (MDA-MB231), wherein daily treatment with CX-3543 (6.25 or 12.5 mg/kg)
was well-tolerated and suppressed tumor growth (Fig. 5B).
Similarly, treatment of mice bearing MIA PaCa-2 pancreatic
xenografts with CX-3543 (5 mg/kg) for 13 days resulted in
significant inhibition of tumor growth with minimal effect on

animal body weights (Fig. 5C). CX-3543 dosing was halted during
days 14 to 20 to allow a drug holiday. Upon resumption of dosing
during days 21 to 26, tumor growth was again inhibited, indicating
that tumors retained sensitivity and had not developed resistance
to CX-3543 during the course of treatment or holiday.

Discussion
As the role of excessive rRNA synthesis in tumorigenesis comes
to be better understood (reviewed in refs. 6, 7, 54), the therapeutic
potential of drugs to target this process becomes more evident. The
recent discovery that loss of certain tumor-suppressors, an
aberration commonly found in cancer, makes cells more susceptible to death in response to rRNA synthesis inhibition, suggests
that a good therapeutic window can be achieved with anticancer
drugs that specifically target Pol I transcription (54). Herein, we
report an innovative anticancer therapeutic approach that is based
on the direct suppression of the rRNA biogenesis by a small
molecule agent, CX-3543 that displaces nucleolin from PQSs on the
nontemplate strand of rDNA, causing rapid redistribution of
nucleolin from nucleoli, inhibition of rRNA synthesis, and
apoptotic death in cancer cells.
Our data indicate that CX-3543 is quite selective in its
mechanism of action. It is able to suppress rRNA synthesis while
having no inhibitory effects on DNA and protein synthesis, RNA
polymerase II–driven transcription of oncogenes, or Topoisomerase
I/II function. Furthermore, CX-3543 failed to elicit biological
responses indicative of interference with telomere function. The
selectivity achieved toward targeting Pol I transcription is
potentially explained by the cellular distribution and pharmacokinetic properties of CX-3543. We have shown that CX-3543
concentrates in nucleoli (Fig. 1B) where rRNA is synthesized and
has not been observed in the nucleoplasm, where the majority of
telomeres are present and where RNA Polymerases II–driven
transcription of oncogenes occurs.
CX-3543 exhibited broad in vitro antiproliferative and in vivo
antitumor activity and was well tolerated in murine xenograft
studies at efficacious doses (Fig. 5). Numerous attempts to isolate
cancer cells (MIA PaCa-2 pancreatic and HCT-116 colorectal cancer
cells) resistant to CX-3543 were unsuccessful using three separate
techniques (selection of naturally occurring resistant mutants,
induction of resistant mutants by UV-mediated mutagenesis, and
dominant suppressor analysis using a human cDNA expression
library; data not shown). Preliminary assessments suggest CX-3543
is not a substrate for multidrug resistance pumps and in vivo
responses are durable. These data suggest a low tendency to
acquire and develop resistance to CX-3543 and could prove to be a
key differentiating factor relative to other anticancer drugs in the
clinical setting.
CX-3543 has recently completed two separate phase I clinical
trials using different dosing schedules in patients with solid
tumors. During the phase I trial, the maximum concentration
(Cmax) values attained in human whole blood when CX-3543
was infused over 6 hours at 360 mg/m2 on the daily 5 schedule
reached 3 to 5 Amol/L. The blood levels achieved clinically are
well within the range of in vitro potency observed for CX-3543. In
addition, CX-3543 was well tolerated, showed a long plasma
half-life, and displayed evidence of biological activity in patients
with carcinoid/neuroendocrine tumors (55). Moreover, preclinical
biodistribution studies in rodents revealed that CX-3543 accumulates in tissues derived from the neural crest, i.e., those tissues

that give rise to carcinoid/neuroendocrine tumors. As a result of
these scientific and clinical findings, CX-3543 was advanced into
phase II clinical trial in patients having carcinoid/neuroendocrine
tumors.
Our findings support a basis for direct targeting of rRNA
biogenesis as a strategy for selective induction of apoptosis in
cancer cells and pave the way for an entirely new class of
anticancer therapeutics.
