ABSTRACT
Acquired drug resistance in childhood T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia
(T-ALL) remains a significant clinical problem. In this study, a novel gene therapy
target for childhood T-ALL to overcome chemoresistance was discovered: TFDP3
increased in the minimal residual disease (MRD) positive childhood T-ALL patients.
Then, we established a preclinical model of resistance to induction therapy to
examine the functional relevance of TFDP3 to chemoresistance in MRD derived from
Jurkat/E6-1. Jurkat xenografts in NOD/SCID mice were exposed to a four drug
combination (VXLD) of vincristine (VCR), dexamethasone (DEX), L-asparaginase
(L-asp) and daunorubicin (DNR). During the 4-week VXLD treatment, the level of
TFDP3 increased 4-fold. High expression of TFDP3 was identified in the re-emerging
lines (Jurkat/MRD) with increased chemoresistance, which is correlated with partially
promoter demethylation of TFDP3. Downregulation of TFDP3 by RNA interference
reversed chemoresistance in Jurkat/MRD accompanied by reinstated E2F1 activity
that coincided with increased levels of p53, p73, and associated proapoptotic target
genes. Importantly, TFDP3 silencing in vivo induced apparent benefit to overcome
chemoresistance in combination with VXLD treatment. Collectively, TFDP3 confers
chemoresistance in MRD within childhood T-ALL, indicating that TFDP3 is a potential
gene therapy target for residual cancer.

(18-30 months) [1]. Typically, induction therapy includes
vincristine (VCR), dexamethasone (DEX), L-asparaginase
(L-asp), and an optional use of an anthracycline such as
daunorubicin (DNR) [1]. Despite the induction therapy
resulting in complete remission rates of >95%, up to
25% of patients relapse and experience a 30% to 50%
likelihood of survival [7]. Early relapse of childhood
T-ALL remains the major cause of treatment failure, and
suggests rapidly acquired resistance to multiple drugs [8].
Recently, the prognostic impact of minimal residual
disease (MRD), which constitutes the most sensitive
predictive factor for relapse in childhood T-ALL, has been
extensively studied [9]. Patients with high MRD levels in
bone marrow aspirates at the end of remission induction
therapy have an increased risk of relapse, suggesting the

INTRODUCTION
Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most
common childhood malignancy, and the most frequent
cause of death from cancer before 20 years of age [1,
2]. T-cell ALL (T-ALL) accounts for 10% to 15% of
childhood ALL, and constitutes up to 48% of highrisk patients [3, 4]. Recent advances in the treatment of
childhood T-ALL have improved the 5-year survival rate
above 75%, which is due to the intensive combination
chemotherapies [5, 6]. The basic components of various
therapies for children with T-ALL is comprised of
an initial induction therapy (4-6 weeks) followed by
intensive combination chemotherapy (6-8 months) and
low-intensity “anti-metabolite” based maintenance therapy

presence of drug resistant subclonal populations within
the MRD selected by specific chemotherapy schedules
[10]. As most chemotherapeutic drugs are DNA damaging
agents, which lead to a programmed cell death, defective
apoptosis allows survival of these cells, making them
resistant [11].
In 2007, we first reported the identification of a
new member of DP family, human TFDP3, which was
initially isolated as a novel cancer-testis antigen (CTA)
in our screening for tumor-associated antigens [12–15].
Consistently, our results revealed that TFDP3 inhibits
E2F1-induced, p53-mediated apoptosis in DNA-damaged
cells via binding to E2F1 as a non-DNA-binding E2F1/
TFDP3 complex [16]. Increasing evidences further
confirmed that TFDP3 is a negative regulator of E2F1induced cell death during DNA damage response [17–19].
In this study, we established a preclinical model of drug
resistance to induction therapy in childhood T-ALL
to broaden our understanding of TFDP3 function in
chemotherapy resistance. Our data showed that TFDP3
confers chemoresistance in MRD within childhood
T-ALL, indicating that targeting TFDP3 is a potential
strategy for overcoming chemoresistance in minimal
residual cancer cells, and stop progression to relapse and
metastatic disease.

consisted of MRD-positive patients with ≥10-4 leukemic
cells (MRD-high) [9]. The entire group of patients
showed low TFDP3 mRNA levels before chemotherapy
(Figure 1A). It is noteworthy that, at the end of remission
induction therapy, the level of TFDP3 was related to a
4-fold increase in the MRD-high (MRD-H) group in
comparison with pre-treatment, whereas no significant
changes were found in the MRD-negative (MRD-N) and
MRD-low (MRD-L) group (Figure 1B).

In vivo selection of childhood T-ALL xenograft
lines
Here, we adopted a pre-clinical model of resistance
to induction therapy in childhood T-ALL for in vivo
selection of xenograft lines in the nonobese diabetic/
severe combined immunodeficient (NOD/SCID) mice
[20, 21]. Flow cytometric analysis of the NOD/SCID mice
engrafted with Jurkat/E6-1 showed that the proportion of
human versus murine CD45+ (%huCD45+) reached 1%
at 4 weeks after inoculation (Figure 2A). Analogous to
the clinical regimen, we optimized a 4-week induction
schedule of VCR, DEX, ASP and DNR (VXLD), which
clearly delayed disease progression in all Jurkat xenografts
(Figure 2A). To allow T-ALL reappearance in the murine
peripheral blood (PB), we developed a protocol consisting
of an 8-week block of VXLD treatment. At harvest,
%huCD45+ routinely exceeded 50% with spleen murine
CD45+ cells being replaced with re-emerging cells (Jurkat/
MRD). Jurkat/MRD lines were then purified and sorted
using FITC-conjugated antihuman CD45 antibody on a
FACSCalibur flow cytometer. Passage-matched controls
(Jurkat/Control) were also harvested for each xenograft
line. To confirm that the Jurkat/MRD and Jurkat/Control
lines were derived from the corresponding Jurkat, Clone
E6-1 (Jurkat/E6-1), short tandem repeat (STR) profiling,
including D5S818, D13S317, D7S820, D16S539, vWA,
TH01, AMEL, TPOX and CSF1PO, was performed and

RESULTS
Association between TFDP3 expression and
MRD load in childhood T-ALL patients
To assess the expression status of TFDP3 in
childhood T-ALL, we determined the mRNA levels of
TFDP3 in the mononuclear cells (MNCs) from 60 T-ALL
childhood patients at diagnosis (Table 1). The first group
consisted of patients with undetectable MRD loads (MRDnegative), the second group had detectable MRD loads
(<10-4 leukemic cells; MRD-low), and the third group

the %huCD45+ decreased along with increasing levels
of TFDP3, and A20 (known as TNFα-induced protein 3)

that, at the end of the 4-week VXLD treatment, the
level of TFDP3 was related to a 4-fold increase, with no
significant changes in the last 8-week block of VXLD
treatment (Figure 2B). Thus, re-emerging lines were
harvested and cultured in the absence of chemotherapy for
4 weeks, and then analyzed for TFDP3 protein expression
using Western Blot. TFDP3 expression increased in Jurkat/
MRD compared with Jurkat/E6-1 and Jurkat/Control
(Figure 2C). In addition, the presence of TFDP3 promoter

stratum [10]. Cells isolated from in vivo drug-selected
xenografts were tested in vitro against each of the four drugs
in the induction schedule of VXLD treatment. Jurkat/MRD
lines demonstrated increased resistance to VCR, DEX, ASP
and DNR, whereas no acquired resistance was observed in
Jurkat/Control, compared with Jurkat/E6-1 (Figure 3).
To determine the functional relevance of TFDP3 to
MDR pattern in MRD, Jurkat/MRD lines were transfected
with TFDP3 siRNA1 or siRNA2 to knock down TFDP3 and
then treated with chemotherapeutic agents. Knockdown of
TFDP3 were confirmed by Western blotting (Figure 4A). No
activation of apoptosis was observed in TFDP3 knockdown
Jurkat/MRD lines (Supplementary Figure S2). It is noted
that suppression of TFDP3 reversed the MDR phenotype in
Jurkat/MRD, resulting in increased apoptosis in response to
each of the four drugs in VXLD (Figure 4B–4E).

E2F1 proteins [15]. As shown in Figure 5A, no change of
E2F1 and TFDP1 expression level was observed in Jurkat/
MRD, when compared to Jurkat/Control. Thus, E2F1 was
immunoprecipitated from the cell lysates with anti-E2F1
antibodies, and the precipitates were then probed with
anti-TFDP1 and anti-TFDP3 antibodies. TFDP3 was
observed to compete with TFDP1 for E2F1 in Jurkat/MRD
lines (Figure 5A). Is endogenous E2F1 activity affected by
TFDP3? Indeed, we found that the base-line level of E2F1
activity in Jurkat/MRD with high expression of TFDP3
was significantly inhibited compared with Jurkat/E6-1 and
Jurkat/Control using a luciferase reporter containing the
E2F1 responsive element (Figure 5B).

As E2F1 is known to induce p53/p73-dependent
apoptosis, we gain our insights into the molecular
mechanisms underlying the TFDP3-mediated inhibition of
E2F1-induced cell death. Figure 5C showed p53 and p73
increased in Jurkat/MRD-1 following TFDP3 knockdown.
In view of the elevated p53 and p73, we further examined
the mRNA levels of a select subset of p53/p73 target
proapoptotic genes. Bax, Puma, Noxa, Bid, Arf and TAp73,
which act in p53- and p73-dependent apoptosis, were
markedly induced in the TFDP3 silencing Jurkat/MRD-1
line (Figure 5D). These results reveal that knockdown of
TFDP3 might reinstate E2F1 activity so as to reverse the
MRD phenotype in Jurkat/MRD lines.

In vivo efficacy of TFDP3 silencing in the
treatment of T-ALL xenografts

treatment failure is 3 to 5 times as high among children
with levels of MRD that are 0.01% or higher at the end
of induction therapy than among those with levels that
are lower than 0.01% [22, 23]. The presence of surviving
MRD immediately after primary induction therapy
suggests that they must be protected by some forms of
genetic changes that are selected for through selective
pressures imposed by chemotherapeutic drugs when these
changes offer a survival advantage. Surviving foci of
MRD can further develop permanent acquired MDR as
a result of sequential genetic changes in response to the
selective pressure of therapy [24]. Changes in expression
of genes representing key biologic processes after
induction therapy, and prognostic implication in MRD.
In 2007, we have characterized a novel cancer testis
antigen, TFDP3 [15]. As a new member of the DP family,
TFDP3 shares a high degree of sequence homology with
TFDP1, which functions to enhance the DNA binding
and the transcriptional activities of E2F1. Nevertheless,
TFDP3 acts as an endogenous negative regulator for
E2F1, which competes with TFDP1 for E2F1 binding,
leading to the formation of inactive heterodimers and
hence the inhibition of E2F1-induced cell death during the
DNA damage [16, 17]. With a view to these features, we
propose a model in which TFDP3 confers MDR pattern
via assisting cell survival upon chemotherapy-induced

Experiments were performed to assess whether the
in vitro response to VXLD treatment reflected the in vivo
experience of xenograft lines. Notably, Jurkat/MRD lines
essentially grew through the VXLD treatment with the
%huCD45+ routinely exceeded 50% at 8 weeks, whereas
Jurkat/E6-1 and Jurkat/Control lines showed no acquired
drug resistance to the VXLD treatment (Figure 6A). To
determine in vivo efficacy of TFDP3 silencing in the
VXLD treatment of T-ALL xenografts, we tested synergy
of TFDP3 shRNA1 or shRNA2 in combination with
VXLD in Jurkat/MRD. TFDP3 shRNAs alone induced
no delay of Jurkat/MRD engraftment (Supplementary
Figure S3). As shown in Figure 6B, the combination of
TFDP3 shRNAs with VXLD induced apparent benefit to
overcome MDR in Jurkat/MRD xenografts, indicating that
TFDP3 silencing effectively reversed the in vivo MDR
phenotype in Jurkat/MRD lines.

DNA damage. In support of this model, we designed to
investigate the functional relevance of TFDP3 to MDR
phenotype in MRD within childhood T-ALL.
Here, we observed that the expression of TFDP3
increased within the MRD-H subgroup of childhood
T-ALL patients after induction therapy. Preclinical
experiments in mouse models further demonstrated that
the selective pressure of therapy led to upregulation
of TFDP3 in MRD. At the end of the 4-week induction
therapy, the level of TFDP3 was related to a 4-fold
increase. Notably, the expression of TFDP3 kept at a high
level in MRD during murine T-ALL relapse. Substantial
DNA methylation changes have previously been reported
to occur during the acquisition of chemoresistance [25,
26]. Among those changes, demethylation at associated
CpG sites within promoters is thought to account for
the high expression of key genes in MDR pattern [27–
29]. By integrating expression profiling and promoter
methylation status, we presented evidence that partially
loss of promoter hypermethylation account for the high
expression of TFDP3 in Jurkat/MRD lines. Taken together,
induction therapy induces TFDP3 expression correlated
with promoter demethylation.
In the analysis for the in vivo development of
chemotherapeutic drug resistance activity in MRD,
leukemia cells isolated from in vivo drug-selected
xenografts were tested in vitro against each of the four
drugs in VXLD treatment. Acquired drug resistance in
Jurkat/MRD lines was identified when compared with
Jurkat/E6-1 and Jurkat/Control lines. More importantly,
TFDP3 silencing by RNA interference reversed

MDR phenotype in Jurkat/MRD lines, indicating an
important role for TFDP3 in the drug-induced DNA
damage response. To understand the action of TFDP3
in MDR, we further determined whether TFDP3mediated inhibition affected E2F1 transcriptional
activity. Indeed, the base-line level of endogenous
E2F1 activity decreased obviously in Jurkat/MRD
lines. E2F1 is known as an inducer of apoptosis in
response to various stresses especially DNA damage.
E2F1-induced apoptosis is thought to contribute to
the elimination of chemotherapy-injured cells that
have an accumulation of DNA damage. Activation of
E2F1 leads cells to apoptosis through p53- and p73dependent pathways [30, 31]. We therefore detected
the protein level of p53 and p73 in a Jurkat/MRD line
following TFDP3 downregulation. Increased expression
of p53 and p73 were identified, which resulted in an
accumulation of a number of proapoptotic genes,
including Bax, Puma, Noxa, Bid, Arf and TAp73 [16,
30]. To extend our observations in vivo, we tested
synergy efficacy of TFDP3 silencing in combination
with VXLD treatment in the Jurkat/MRD xenografts.
An apparent benefit to overcome MDR in Jurkat/MRD
xenografts was identified via intravenous injection
with the lentivirus of TFDP3 shRNAs. Since TFDP3 is
limited to expression in testis and most cancer tissues,
including hepatocellular carcinoma, prostate cancer,
breast cancer, targeting TFDP3 may provide a novel
promising strategy for overcoming chemoresistance
in residual cancer, and stop progression to relapse and
metastatic disease.

CONCLUSIONS

RNA extraction and real-time quantitative PCR

Our study demonstrates that TFDP3 contributes
to MDR pattern in MRD by suppressing E2F1-induced
apoptosis, and targeting TFDP3 may provide a promising
strategy for improving leukemia treatment and for
overcoming DNA damage based chemoresistance in
residual cancer.

Total RNA from each specimen was isolated
using Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA).
RNA quality and concentration were assessed using the
NanoDrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer (NanoDrop
Technologies Inc.). RNA was reverse transcribed using the
Superscript™ first-strand cDNA synthesis kit (TaKaRa).
Fluorescence quantitative PCR instrument (Applied
Biosystems 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR Systems, Life
Technologies, CA, USA) and a SYBR® Premix EX Tag™
kit (TaKaRa) were used to detect target gene expressions,
and GAPDH was used as an internal reference. Primer
sequences used in this study are described in the
supporting information (Supplementary Table S3). The
2-ΔΔCT method was employed to determine the relative
expression of target genes normalized to GAPDH, and
experiments were repeated in triplicate [33, 34].

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Clinical samples
Bone marrow samples from childhood T-ALL
patients at diagnosis, collected at the Hematology
Laboratory of Peking University First Hospital between
2010 and 2015, were retrospectively studied. The current
study was approved by the Biomedical Ethical Committee
of Peking University. Mononuclear cells from patients’
bone marrow were separated using the lymphocyte
separation medium following the manufacturer’s
instructions (Lonza Walkersville Inc.). T cells were
isolated from PBMC by immunomagnetic negative
selection using EasySep™ Human T Cell Isolation Kit
(StemCell Technologies Inc.). The purity of the isolated
T cells was >95%, as determined by flow cytometric
analysis. T cells from 5 healthy donors were pooled and
used as an internal control [32].

STRs DNA fingerprinting and methylation
specific PCR
Genomic DNA was extract from Jurkat/E6-1, Jurkat/
Control and Jurkat/MRD cell lines using the Gentra
Puregene kit (QIAGEN). STR profiling analysis for each
cell line was performed at Peking University Center for
Human Disease Genomics, and compared with Jurkat/
E6-1 in the ATCC databases for possible matches. The
genomic DNA was also bisulfite modified and subjected
to methylation-specific PCR. The primers used were 5’ATG TTA GTT TTA TTG AAG TTA ACG A-3’ and 5’ACT AAA CTA TCC AAA AAT TTT CGA C-3’ for the
methylation reaction, and 5’-ATG TTA GTT TTA TTG
AAG TTA ATG A-3’ and 5’-ACT AAA CTA TCC AAA
AAT TTT CAA C-3’ for the unmethylated reaction. The
PCR protocols were 40 cycles of a 30 s denaturation
step at 96°C, a 30 s annealing step at 64°C, and a 30 s
extension step at 72°C.

Development of Jurkat xenograft lines
All experimental procedures involving NOD/SCID
mice were approved by the Biomedical Ethical Committee
of Peking University. Female NOD/SCID mice aged
5 to 6 weeks were purchased from Peking University
Laboratory Animal Centre (Beijing, China), and housed
in a specific pathogen-free environment for 1 week prior to
inoculation with human leukemia cells. Jurkat, Clone E6-1
(ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA) was expanded at 37°C in a
humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air in RPMI
1640 medium (Gibco BRL) containing 10% fetal bovine
serum (Gibco BRL, Grand Island, NY, USA). Jurkat
xenograft NOD/SCID mice were established as previously
described [21]. Engraftment and disease progression were
monitored by enumerating the %huCD45+[20]. When
the %huCD45+ reached 1%, mice were immediately
randomized for VXLD treatment (Supplementary Table
S2). A 4-week induction schedule was adopted, analogous
to the clinical regimen, which delayed disease progression
in all xenografts. To develop re-emerging cell lines, we
stopped the VXLD treatment for 8 weeks to allow disease
reappearance until %huCD45+ exceed 50%. Jurkat/MRD
cells were purified by density gradient centrifugation, and
sorted using FITC-conjugated antihuman CD45 antibody
(BD, USA) on a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD
Immunocytometry Systems, USA).

In vitro cytotoxicity assays
Drug sensitivity was assessed using the colorimetric
MTT assay as described previously [21]. Cell survival
was expressed as percentage of solvent-treated controls.
Results presented are the mean ± SE of at least three
independent experiments.

RNA interference targeting TFDP3
The TFDP3 siRNA1 (5’-CAG AAG TGC TGA
TGT GGA T-3’) or TFDP3 siRNA2 (OriGene, Rockville,
MD, USA) was used for TFDP3 downregulation [17].
The siRNA (5’-TTC TCC GAA CGT GTC ACG T-3’)
unrelated to TFDP3 was used as the control siRNA (Con).
Non-transfected cells were used as negative control (NC).

pLVX-shRNA vectors [35, 36]. The lentivirus of TFDP3
shRNAs was used for in vivo TFDP3 downregulation.
To assess in vivo efficacy of TFDP3 shRNAs, Jurkat/
MRD xenografts were treated with a 4-week VXLD, and
assigned to receive intravenous either phosphate-buffered
saline or non-effective shRNA (shNC) or TFDP3 shRNA1
or shRNA2 twice per week. %huCD45+ was monitored
using flow cytometric analysis.

Western blotting
Cells were harvested and lysed for protein extraction
followed by the determination of protein concentration.
The supernatant was used for Western blotting. Proteins
were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto
polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes. The
membranes were incubated with primary antibodies,
including anti-E2F1, anti-TFDP1, anti-TFDP3, anti-p53,
anti-p73 and anti-β actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, CA,
USA), followed by incubation with secondary antibodies
conjugated to HRP. Signal development was performed
with an ECL kit (QIAGEN). Each experiment was
performed three times.

Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting
Cells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered
saline and resuspended in lysis buffer containing 20 mM
Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1mM
EDTA, 5 μg/mL aprotinin, 5 μg/mL leupeptin, and 2mM
phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The lysate was incubated
with anti-E2F1 antibody at a final concentration of 2 μg/
mL with 25 μL of protein A-agarose (Roche Applied
Science) for at least 2 h at 4°C. The precipitates were
separated on polyacrylamide gels and blotted onto
PVDF membranes. These bolts were then analyzed with
antibodies specific for TFDP1 and TFDP3 [15].

Cells were transfected with 0.14 μg of E2F
luciferase reporter plasmid, 0.14 μg of pRL-SV140
Renilla luciferase reporter plasmid as an internal control,
and performed as previously described [15]. The luciferase
activities were determined using a dual specific luciferase
assay kit (Promega). The firefly luciferase activity was
normalized to the corresponding Renilla luciferase activity
and presented as a multiple of that in cells transfected with
the reporter construct alone.
