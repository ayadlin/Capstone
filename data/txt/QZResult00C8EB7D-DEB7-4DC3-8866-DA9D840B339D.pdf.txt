BACKGROUND. Lonafarnib is an orally bioavailable nonpetidomimetic farnesyl
transferase inhibitor with significant activity against BCR-ABL-positive cell lines
and primary human chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cells. Lonafarnib can inhibit the proliferation of imatinib-resistant cells and increases imatinib-induced
apoptosis in vitro in cells from imatinib-resistant patients.

METHODS. The authors conducted a phase 1 study of lonafarnib in combination
with imatinib in patients with CML who failed imatinib therapy. The starting
dose level for patients with chronic phase (CP) disease was imatinib, 400 mg/
day,plus lonafarnib at a dose of 100 mg twice daily. The starting dose levels
for accelerated phase (AP) and blast phase (BP) disease were 600 mg/day and
100 mg twice daily, respectively.

RESULTS. A total of 23 patients were treated (9 with CP, 11 with AP, and 3 with
BP) for a median of 25 weeks (range, 4–102 weeks). Of those with CP disease,
2 patients had grade 3 (according to the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria [version 2.0]) dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) at the 400 1 125-mg
dose, including diarrhea (2 patients), vomiting (1 patient), and fatigue (1 patient).
In patients with AP/BP disease, DLTs were observed at the 600 1 125-mg dose
and was comprised of diarrhea (1 patient) and hypokalemia (1 patient). Eight
patients (35%) responded; 3 with CP disease achieved a complete hematologic
response (CHR) (2 patients) and a complete cytogenetic response (1 patient).
Three patients with AP disease responded (2 CHR, 1 partial cytogenetic

oncogene, which translates into a Bcr-Abl oncoprotein with increased tyrosine kinase activity.1,2 Imatinib is standard therapy for patients with CML,2
inducing durable responses,3–6 particularly among
those who achieved a major molecular response.7,8
However, a subset of patients eventually develop resistance, particularly those treated in the advanced
stages of disease.9,10 Thus, there is a need to investigate novel agents to overcome and potentially prevent resistance to imatinib.
Ras is one of the downstream pathways activated
through Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase activity. Suppression
of Ras function leads to the inhibition of cellular
growth in Bcr-Abl-positive cells, suggesting that Ras
inhibition could be a therapeutic target in CML.11–13
Ras activation requires a post-translational modification that allows attachment to the inner leaflet of the
plasma membrane. This process requires a prenylation process that is mediated by at least 2 known
enzymes, farnesyl transferase (FTase) and geranyl-geranyl transferase (GGTase).14,15 Inhibition of these
enzymes was sought as a means of inhibiting Ras,
leading to the development of Ftase inhibitors (FTIs).
Although FTIs indeed inhibit FTase, their antineoplastic effect is mediated only partially, if at all,
through Ras inhibition. Other proteins that require
farnesylation, such as RhoB, the centromeric proteins
CENP-E and CENP-F, and Rab may be more relevant
for their mechanism of action.16–19
Lonafarnib (SCH66336) is a nonpeptidomimetic
FTI that induces the dose-dependent inhibition of
colony formation and proliferation of Bcr-Abl-transformed BaF3 cells and cells from CML patients.20,21
In Bcr-Abl leukemic mouse models, treatment with
lonafarnib resulted in prolonged survival.21,22 Lonafarnib also inhibits the proliferation of imatinib-resistant Bcr-Abl-positive cell lines and colony
formation of cells from imatinib-resistant CML
patients, and sensitizes imatinib-resistant cells to
imatinib-induced apoptosis.23 Furthermore, lonafarnib may reduce the resistance of primitive quiescent
CML stem cells to imatinib.24
By itself, lonafarnib has minimal clinical activity
among patients with imatinib failure.25 However,
based on the in vitro synergy of imatinib and lonafarnib, we conducted a phase 1 study to determine the
maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose-limiting
toxicities (DLTs) of this combination for patients with
CML in chronic phase (CP), accelerated phase (AP),
or blast phase (BP) who failed prior imatinib therapy.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients age 16 years with Ph-positive CML in CP,
AP, or BP were treated. The eligibility criteria for

patients in CP were failure to achieve or loss of
a complete hematologic response (CHR) after
3 months of imatinib therapy, minimal cytogenetic
response after 6 months of imatinib therapy, or
major cytogenetic response after 12 months of imatinib therapy. AP and BP were defined as previously
reported.26 Other eligibility criteria included: 1)
ECOG performance status < 2, 2) bilirubin < 2.0 mg/
dL, and 3) creatinine < 2 mg/mL. Patients with a
QTc > 500 milliseconds or class III and IV New York
Heart Association heart disease were excluded. All
patients provided informed consent approved by the
Institutional Review Board.

Treatment Schedule
For patients with CP disease, the starting dose was
imatinib, 400 mg orally daily, and lonafarnib, 100 mg
orally twice daily. For patients with disease in
advanced stages, the starting dose was imatinib, 600
mg orally every day, and lonafarnib, 100 mg orally
twice daily. Dose escalation of lonafarnib in subsequent cohorts of patients was performed by 25-mg,
twice-daily dose increments, up to a maximum
planned dose of 250 mg twice daily. This dose escalation was performed according to a classic ‘‘3 1 3’’
phase 1 design. There was no dose escalation of imatinib. Patients who developed grade 3 nonhematologic toxicity had their treatment interrupted until
toxicity resolved to grade < 1. Therapy was then
reinstituted with 1 dose level reduction. Therapy also
could be interrupted in patients with CP disease for
grade 4 neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count
[ANC] < 0.5 3 109/L) or a platelet count < 40 3 109/L
until counts recovered above these values. Therapy
was then reinitiated at the same dose level if recovered within 2 weeks, or with a dose reduction by 1
dose level if recovered after 2 weeks. For patients
with AP disease, therapy was continued below this
platelet threshold if thrombocytopenia was disease
related. For patients in BP, there were no dose modifications for hematologic toxicity during the first
month. For patients with AP and BP disease who
achieved a CHR, the dose modification schema for
myelosuppression described in CP was used thereafter. Dose adjustment was done for 1 of the drugs
only if the toxicity was clearly attributable to it. The
administration of hydroxyurea was allowed in any
disease stage for the first 3 months of therapy only.
The use of anagrelide was allowed at any time. Intrapatient dose escalation was allowed for patient who
demonstrated no grade 3 toxicity after 4 weeks of
therapy if not in CHR, or if no improvement in cytogenetic response by 1 category provided there was
no persistent grade > 2 toxicity.

Lonafarnib and Imatinib Combination in CML/Cortes et al.

Toxicities were evaluated using the revised National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria
(version 2.0). DLT was defined as any grade 3 nonhematologic adverse event occurring during the first
cycle of therapy. Nausea and vomiting were considered DLTs only if they were not responsive to antiemetic therapy and diarrhea only if uncontrolled for
48 hours despite adequate antidiarrheal therapy. A
hematologic DLT was defined as an ANC < 1 3 109/
L or platelet count < 50 3 109/L lasting for 6 weeks
with a hypocellular bone marrow and no bone marrow blasts. Anemia was not considered to be a hematologic DLT.

Pretreatment and Follow-up Studies
Pretreatment evaluation included history and physical examination; complete blood count (CBC) and
differential, blood chemistry, and coagulation studies;
bone marrow aspiration with cytogenetics; and electrocardiogram (EKG). During the study, CBC and differential were performed weekly for the first 2 weeks,
and every 2 to 4 weeks thereafter. Blood chemistry
was performed weekly for the first 2 weeks, and then
every 4 to 6 weeks. Bone marrow aspiration and cytogenetics were performed every 3 months for the
first year, and every 6 to 12 months thereafter. EKG
was performed monthly. Response was defined as
previously reported.27
Pharmacokinetics
Blood samples for the determination of plasma lonafarnib concentrations were collected on Day 15 at 0,
1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 12 hours. Blood samples for the
determination of plasma imatinib concentrations
were collected on Days 7 and 15 at the same times.
Blood samples were analyzed by liquid chromatography with the tandem mass spectrometric detection
method. The lower limit of quantification was 5.00
ng/mL and 20.0 ng/mL, respectively, for lonafarnib
and imatinib. Plasma was separated by centrifugation, divided into 2 aliquots, and stored frozen until
analysis. The analysis for lonafarnib was performed
at Taylor Technology (Princeton, NJ) and at MDS
Pharma Service, Inc. (St. Laurent, Quebec, Canada)
for imatinib.
Individual plasma lonafarnib and imatinib concentrations were used for pharmacokinetics analysis
using model-independent methods.28 The maximum
plasma concentration (Cmax) and time of maximum
plasma concentration (Tmax) were the observed
values. The area under the plasma concentration-time
curve (AUC) during each dosing interval (s) was calculated using the linear trapezoidal method. The terminal phase rate constant (K) could not be calculated in

this study for both lonafarnib and imatinib due to
insufficient numbers of time points in the terminal
phase. At steady-state, the apparent total body clearance was calculated as Cl/F 5 Dose/AUC(s), in which
s is 12 hours and 24 hours, respectively, for lonafarnib
and imatinib.

Statistical Analysis
A minimum of 3 patients were entered at each dose
level. If no DLT was observed in 3 patients treated at
a given dose level after the last patient treated had
been observed for a minimum of 3 weeks, dose escalation was indicated in the next cohort of patients.
If a DLT occurred in 1 of 3 patients, 3 additional
patients were to be entered at the same dose level. If
grade 3 or 4 toxicity developed in 2 of 3 or 6 patients,
the dose was considered to exceed the MTD. Therefore, the MTD was defined as the dose resulting in a
DLT in 1 of 6 patients. Once the MTD was defined,
additional patients were treated at this dose to define
the toxicity profile more precisely.

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
Between November 2002 and July 2004, 23 patients
were treated (Table 1). Prior therapy included imatinib (23 patients); interferon-based therapy (16
patients); and other agents such homoharringtonine,
decitabine, and clofarabine (7 patients). Four
patients had received imatinib as their first therapy
for CML. The median time from diagnosis was 51

months and patients had received imatinib for a median of 23 months. At the time the combination
treatment was initiated, 10 patients were still receiving imatinib at a median dose of 800 mg (range,
400–800 mg), and 8 were being treated with other
agents, including hydroxyurea (7 patients) and anagrelide (1 patient). Eight of the 14 patients in AP or
BP (62%) had clonal evolution. ABL sequencing was
performed in 21 patients at the start of this trial and
mutations were found in 11 patients (52%). The most
frequent mutations were G250E (3 patients) and
Y253H (2 patients).

Toxicity and Dose Escalation
All 23 patients were assessable for toxicity (Table 2).
The most common adverse events were diarrhea in
13 patients (5 of whom had CP disease), and nausea
in 7 patients (1 of whom had CP disease).
For patients in CP, the initial 3 patients received
lonafarnib at a dose of 100 mg twice daily and imatinib at a dose of 400 mg/day. The median time on
therapy was 8 months (range, 2–18 months). No
patients experienced a DLT. One patient required a
dose escalation of imatinib to 600 mg due to a lack
of optimal response. Three patients received lonafarnib at a dose of 125 mg twice daily and imatinib at a
dose of 400 mg/day. The median time on therapy
was 3 months. Grade 3 diarrhea was observed in all
3 patients and was considered to be a DLT in 2 of

them. One patient had intermittent short-term grade
3 diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting resulting in grade 3
fatigue. These events occurred 6 weeks after the
initiation of therapy and resulted in drug interruption and reduction of lonafarnib to 100 mg twice
daily. The patient was managed with supportive
measures, did not respond, and was removed from
the study after 3 months. The second patient developed grade 3 recurrent diarrhea 2 days after the
initiation of treatment. Therapy was withheld repetitively and resumed after the diarrhea resolved. Due
to the recurrence of diarrhea, lonafarnib was reduced
to a dose of 100 mg twice daily. However, the patient
developed disease progression and was removed
from the study 1 month later. Thus, the MTD for
lonafarnib was 100 mg twice daily and was 400 mg/
day for imatinib. Therefore, this cohort was
expanded and 3 additional patients were treated for
a median of 12 months (range, 2–24 months). None
of these patients developed a DLT.
For patients in advanced stages of disease, the 3
initial patients received lonafarnib at a dose of 100
mg twice daily and imatinib at a dose of 600 mg/day.
The median time on therapy was 2 months (range,
1–4 months). There was no DLT reported. The next
3 patients were treated with lonafarnib at a dose
of 125 mg twice daily and imatinib at a dose of
600 mg/day for a median of 2 months (range,
1–3 months). One patient in BP developed grade 3

1299

diarrhea 3 days after the start of treatment. The treatment was withheld for 3 days and the patient was
treated symptomatically. Lonafarnib was resumed at
a dose of 100 mg twice daily once diarrhea resolved.
The treatment was withdrawn after 1 month due to
lack of response. This constituted a DLT and the
cohort was expanded with 3 additional patients treated for a median of 9 months (range, 4–16 months).
One patient in BP experienced grade 3 hypokalemia
4 weeks after the initiation of therapy. The potassium
was replaced and treatment was withheld for 7 days
and then resumed with dose reduction. The patient
had a second prolonged episode of hypokalemia,
necessitating treatment interruption that resulted in
disease progression. Thus, lonafarnib at a dose of
100 mg twice daily and imatinib at a dose of 600
mg/day was considered the MTD. Five additional
patients were treated at this dose for a median of
7 months (range, 1–20 months), 3 of whom developed grade 3 toxicity consisting of fatigue, hypokalemia, and diarrhea, respectively, which occurred after
2 cycles, 4 cycles, and 4 cycles, respectively.

Pharmacokinetics
Blood samples for the evaluation of lonafarnib pharmacokinetics were collected on Day 15 for all
patients. There was no apparent increase in plasma
lonafarnib concentrations when a dose of 100 mg of
lonafarnib was coadministered with 400 mg and 600
mg of imatinib (Figs. 1a and 1b). The mean plasma
concentrations and AUC values of lonafarnib
appeared to be lower when 100 mg and 125 mg of
lonafarnib were coadministered with 600 mg of imatinib compared with 400 mg.
Blood samples for the evaluation of imatinib
pharmacokinetics were collected on Days 7 and 15.
Plasma imatinib concentrations were similar
between Days 7 and 15, indicating steady-state was
attained. There were no apparent increases in exposure to imatinib when coadministered with lonafarnib.
The AUC values of imatinib when coadministered
with 100 mg to 125 mg of lonafarnib were found to
be similar to those reported in a previous study in
which imatinib was administered alone.29 An increase
in the dose of lonafarnib from 100 mg to 125 mg was
found to have no effect on the pharmacokinetics of
imatinib (Figs. 2a and 2b).
Response
Patient response is shown in Table 3. Eight patients
(35%) had evidence of antileukemia activity. Three of
9 patients (33%) in CP responded. Two of 6 patients
not in CHR at the initiation of therapy achieved a
CHR that lasted for 7 months and 13 months,

the study because of a lack of cytogenetic response
and received another tyrosine kinase inhibitor. One
patient, who started the study in CHR and had lost a
prior cytogenetic response, achieved a complete
cytogenetic response that lasted 12 months. None of
the patients who responded had mutations at the
initiation of therapy.

disease responded. Two patients with AP disease
achieved CHRs that lasted 2 months and 19 months,
respectively, and another patient with a CHR but

F359V, and E292V, respectively) of the kinase domain.

DISCUSSION
The purpose of the current study was to define the
MTD for the combination of lonafarnib and imatinib
for patients with CML. This combination is of interest because of the nonoverlapping mechanisms of
action of the combination that could induce a

sequential blockade of activated pathways in CML.30
As single agents, FTIs have modest activity in
patients who fail therapy with imatinib.25,31 Lonafarnib, given continuously at a dose of 200 mg twice
daily, induced transient responses in 2 of 13 patients
(15%) who failed prior therapy with imatinib.25 In
vitro studies have suggested that the combination of
FTI and imatinib may be synergistic.23 Furthermore,
some studies have suggested that early progenitors
are quiescent and insensitive to imatinib32 and dasatinib.33 Lonafarnib24 and another FTI, BMS-214662,34
have been reported to significantly reduce the resistance of these progenitors to imatinib24,34 and dasatinib.34 All of this data suggested this combination
could be potentially beneficial in patients with CML.
Consistent with the established toxicities of single-agent lonafarnib,32 gastrointestinal toxicities were
found to be the most significant, with diarrhea being
the DLT. This could frequently be controlled with
proper management, but in 3 patients it led to the
permanent discontinuation of therapy. Although imatinib can also cause diarrhea in approximately 30%
of patients,4,6 these DLTs were most likely due to
lonafarnib because these patients had not experienced diarrhea while receiving imatinib. Grade 3/4
myelosuppression was uncommon and transient.
The MTD of lonafarnib was lower than the dose
recommended as a single agent (200 mg twice
daily35) but was similar to other combination trials
in solid tumors in which the MTD was 100 mg twice
daily.36 In other lonafarnib studies,25,37 diarrhea has
responded to treatment interruptions, and it is possible that an intermittent schedule in which lonafarnib
is administered for a few weeks and a rest period
given between cycles might be better tolerated.

Pharmacokinetic analysis indicated that the concomitant administration of these agents did not result
in increased exposure to either agent. The AUCs of
both drugs were in the active range and similar to
those observed when each drug is used alone.29 It is
interesting to note that the mean plasma concentrations and AUC values of lonafarnib were lower when
doses of 100 mg and 125 mg were coadministered
with 600 mg of imatinib compared with patients who
received 400 mg. The small number of patients precludes firm conclusions, but 1 possible explanation
may be an increase in the volume of distribution at
the higher dose of imatinib,4,6 although none of the
patients treated in the current study developed grade
3 edema. Imatinib is not an inducer of CYP 3A4.29
Thus, the decreased plasma concentrations of lonafarnib when it is coadministered with the higher dose of
imatinib are unlikely to be due to the induction of
CYP 3A4 that metabolizes lonafarnib.
Responses occurred in 8 patients (35%). The majority of responses were hematologic but 2 patients
achieved a cytogenetic response. Three responding
patients (all with AP disease) had Abl kinase mutations. The clinical efficacy of this combination
remains modest and inferior to the new TKIs such as
nilotinib38 and dasatinib.39 Allogeneic stem cell
transplantation was also reported to be an important
salvage option for patients who develop resistance to
imatinib, including those with mutations in the BcrAbl kinase domain.40 New TKIs have demonstrated
significant preclinical activity in cells carrying the
majority of abl-kinase mutants (except T315I),41,42
which has translated into significant clinical activity
in patients with CML after imatinib failure. In fact,
11 of the 23 patients reported in the current study
received new TKIs after failure with the combination
of imatinib and lonafarnib; 5 of them achieved hematologic or cytogenetic responses. Nevertheless,
single-agent therapy may be unable to eliminate all
leukemia cells43 and may lead to the eventual development of resistance. Indeed, new mutations can be
induced in vitro after exposure to dasatinib or nilotinib under appropriate experimental conditions.44,45
These mutations already have been identified in
patients failing dasatinib.46 It is conceivable that
multiagent therapy may be needed to completely
eradicate the disease. In this regard, it is interesting
that the earliest leukemic progenitors have been
reported to be insensitive to the available TKI,32,34
and FTI may reduce the resistance of these progenitors to TKI.24,34 Therefore, further exploration of
these combinations, perhaps with the new TKI, and
using them in an earlier setting to prevent the development of resistance might be attractive.

We conclude that lonafarnib given at a dose of
100 mg twice daily in combination with imatinib can
be administered safely in patients with CML. This
combination has nonoverlaping mechanisms of action
that result in clinical activity in some patients with
imatinib-resistant disease. With the development of
novel, more potent TKIs, the combination of FTIs and
these new agents deserves further investigation.
