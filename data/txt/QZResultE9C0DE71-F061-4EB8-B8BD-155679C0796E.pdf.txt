Abstract
Sphingosine kinase 1 (SK1) plays an important role in estrogen-dependent breast tumorigenesis, but its
regulation is poorly understood. A subset of microRNAs (miRNA, miR) is regulated by estrogen and contributes to
cellular proliferation and cancer progression. Here, we describe that miR-515-5p is transcriptionally repressed by
estrogen receptor a (ERa) and functions as a tumor suppressor in breast cancer. Its downregulation enhances cell
proliferation and estrogen-dependent SK1 activity, mediated by a reduction of miR-515-5p posttranscriptional
repression. Enforced expression of miR-515-5p in breast cancer cells causes a reduction in SK1 activity, reduced
cell proliferation, and the induction of caspase-dependent apoptosis. Conversely, opposing effects occur with
miR-515-5p inhibition and by SK1 silencing. Notably, we show that estradiol (E2) treatment downregulates miR515-5p levels, whereas the antiestrogen tamoxifen causes a decrease in SK1, which is rescued by silencing miR515-5p. Analysis of chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-Seq) data reveals that miR-515-5p
suppression is mediated by a direct interaction of ERa within its promoter. RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq) analysis
of breast cancer cells after overexpressing miR-515-5p indicates that it partly modulates cell proliferation by
regulating the Wnt pathway. The clinical implications of this novel regulatory system are shown as miR-515-5p is
signiﬁcantly downregulated in ER-positive (n ¼ 146) compared with ER-negative (n ¼ 98) breast cancers. Overall,
we identify a new link between ERa, miR-515-5p, proliferation, and apoptosis in breast cancer tumorigenesis.

Introduction
Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women worldwide. About 75% of breast cancers are estrogen receptor a
(ERa)–positive and cell proliferation in these tumors is highly
estrogen-dependent (1). ERa–positive breast cancers have
been successfully treated with hormonal therapies that either
block estrogen production or antagonize its action (2). Among
these, tamoxifen (4-hydroxytamoxifen) blocks estrogen binding to the ERa and is primarily responsible for the dramatic

increase in survival of patients with breast cancer over the past
30 years (3).
Sphingosine kinase 1 (SK1) is the key regulator of the sphingolipid rheostat, which helps maintain the balance between cell
growth/survival and cell-cycle arrest/apoptosis. It converts the
proapoptotic sphingosine into the prosurvival sphingosine 1phosphate, mediating breast cancer cell survival, proliferation,
and migration (4). In ERa–positive breast cancers, SK1 has been
shown to mediate estrogen-dependent tumorigenesis (5) and
high expression has been correlated clinically with reduced
metastasis-free survival (6). Blocking SK1 expression using
siRNAs or selective inhibitors abolishes the response of breast
cancer tumors in vivo to estrogens and restores the sensitivity of
breast cancer cells resistant to antiestrogens and tamoxifen (7).
This indicates the requirement of SK1 in the estrogen response
mechanism and the importance of this enzyme in breast cancer
hormonal chemoresistance (7). Although estrogens have been
described to contribute to a higher activation of S1P receptors,
by stimulating the sphingosine 1-phosphate export (8), the
mechanism underlying the upregulation of SK1 activity by
estrogens is still unclear.
microRNAs (miRNA, miR) are small noncoding RNAs,
which negatively regulate target gene expression. By binding
to the 30 -untranslated region (30 –UTR) or open reading
frame (ORF) of their gene targets, they induce mRNA

destabilization/degradation and translational repression (9).
They are able to act as tumor suppressors or oncogenes, and
we and others have shown that a subset of miRNAs is
regulated by estrogen (10–12). This indicates that miRNAs
may be a new generation of anticancer molecules and
miRNA-based therapies could provide an alternative to
standard chemotherapeutics (13).
In this study, we aimed to elucidate the mechanism by which
estrogen upregulates SK1 levels. Because dysregulation of
miRNA expression has been observed in breast cancer cell
lines and tumors upon estrogen or tamoxifen treatment (10),
we investigated whether miRNAs control the oncogenic role of
SK1 in estrogen-dependent breast cancer. We found two
miRNAs capable of directly regulating SK1 expression, and we
showed that loss of miR-515-5p in particular results in
increased oncogenic SK1 activity. Furthermore, miR-515-5p
overexpression in breast cancer cells inhibited cell proliferation and induced caspase-dependent apoptosis. Analysis of
chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-Seq) data
of ERa revealed that ligand-activated ERa directly suppresses
miR-515-5p gene transcription, and accordingly tamoxifen
treatment upregulated mature levels and decreased SK1 activity. RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq) of breast cancer cells after
miR-515-5p overexpression revealed several downregulated
transcripts involved in apoptosis and the Wnt pathway. Finally,
we found that miR-515-5p expression is signiﬁcantly lower in
ERa–positive breast cancers than ERa–negative tumors.
Therefore, miR-515-5p replacement strategies may offer a
novel therapeutic approach in hormone-resistant ERa–positive breast cancer and as an adjunct to currently available
therapies.

Luciferase assays
Ampliﬁcation of the 30 -UTR region of SK1 was achieved by
PCR using genomic DNA and the primers were described in the
Supplementary Table S2. The DNA fragment obtained was then
cloned into the HindIII and SpeI sites of the multiple cloning sites
(MCS) of pMIR-REPORT Fireﬂy Luciferase vector (Applied Biosystems). After selecting the positive clones, sequencing conﬁrmed the presence of the 30 -UTR region of SK1 in the plasmid.
Site-directed mutagenesis of the SK1 30 -UTR was conducted by
using the QuikChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene, Agilent Technologies) according to the manufacturer's
instructions, and the speciﬁc primer sets are described in the
Supplementary Table S2. The mutation was conﬁrmed by
sequencing. Cells were plated in 24-well plates the day before
transfection. Cells were then cotransfected with 100 ng of pMIR30 -UTR SK1 or pMIR-30 -UTRMUT SK1 (Fireﬂy), 50 ng of pRLTK
(Renilla; Applied Biosystems) and 50 nmol/L of precursor
miRNA mimics (pre-miRs; Applied Biosystems) using 1.3 mL of
Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). After 24 hours, both Fireﬂy and
Renilla luciferase activities were quantiﬁed using the Dual-Glo
Luciferase Assay System (Promega). Fireﬂy luciferase activity
was normalized to the luminescence obtained for Renilla luciferase activity. Cloning of the miR-515-5p promoter region into
the pGl2-basic plasmid (Promega) was carried out by Eurogentec (Supplementary Table S3). Cells were plated in 24-well
plates. After starving for 3 days, cells were treated with 10 nmol/L
E2 and transfected with 200 ng of miR-515-5p promoter pGl2basic and 100 ng of pRLTK (Applied Biosystems) using 1.5 mL of
Fugene reagent (Roche). As previously mentioned, after 24
hours, both Fireﬂy and Renilla luciferase activities were quantiﬁed using the Dual-Glo Luciferase Assay System and Fireﬂy
luciferase was normalized to Renilla luciferase.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines
Human breast cancer cell lines (MCF7, ZR-75-1, and MDAMB-231) were obtained from American Type Culture Collection and maintained in Dulbecco's Modiﬁed Eagle Medium
(DMEM; Gibco) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS;
Gibco), 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 mg/mL streptomycin
(pen/strep) at 37 C with 5% CO2. Before treatment with
ethanol (used as negative control), estradiol (17b-estradiol,
E2; Sigma-Aldrich Ltd.), or tamoxifen (Sigma), cells were
maintained for 3 days in DMEM without phenol red (Gibco)
supplemented with 10% double charcoal–stripped FCS (Gibco)
and pen/strep at 37 C with 5% CO2. On the day of treatment,
media was changed to DMEM without phenol red (Gibco)
supplemented with 10% FCS (Gibco) and 100 U/mL penicillin
and 100 mg/mL streptomycin.
Tumor tissues
Analysis of miRNAs in formalin-ﬁxed parafﬁn-embedded
(FFPE) tissues was approved by a U.K. National Research
Ethics Committee (London; 07/Q0401/20) and by Imperial
College Healthcare NHS Trust (London, United Kingdom).
Three sections of 5 mm sections were obtained from FFPE
tumor samples (n ¼ 34) and macrodissected. Clinicopathologic information about the patients is provided in Supplementary Table S1.

miRNA and siRNA transfection
Cells were plated the day before transfection. Cells were
cotransfected with 50 nmol/L of pre-miR, 200 nmol/L of antimiR, or 20 nmol/L of siRNA (Applied Biosystems) using the
HiPerFect Transfection Reagent (Qiagen) according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
SK1 activity assay
MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 cell pellets were resuspended in
SK1 buffer (20 mmol/L Tris pH 7.4, 20% glycerol, 1 mmol/L
b-mercaptoethanol, 1 mmol/L EDTA, 1 mmol/L sodium orthovanadate, 40 mmol/L b-glycerophosphate, 15 mmol/L NaF,
1 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl ﬂuoride, 10 mg/mL leupeptin,
10 mg/mL aprotinin, 10 mg/mL soybean trypsin inhibitor, and
0.5 mmol/L 4-deoxypyridoxine). The SK1 activity assay was
conducted as previously described (14).
Cell proliferation assays
To analyze cell viability and proliferation, MTT (Sigma;
ref. 15) and Trypan blue (16) assays were conducted as previously described.

True-Seq RNA Preparation Kit (Illumina Inc.) according to
the manufacturer's instructions. Paired end sequences (reads)
100 nt in length were then generated using a HiSeq 2000
instrument (Illumina). FASTQ ﬁles containing the sequenced
reads, obtained at the end of the sequencing, were mapped to the
University of California at Santa Cruz (UCSC; Santa Cruz,
CA) human genome (hg19 assembly) with TopHat version
1.4.1 (http://tophat.cbcb.umd.edu), using default settings. The
mapped bam ﬁles obtained at the end of the runs were then
analyzed using Cufﬂinks version 2.1.0 http://cufﬂinks.cbcb.umd.
edu for RNA quantiﬁcation and analysis. To evaluate whether
ERa interacts with the miR-515-5p promoter, we reanalyzed
ChIP-Seq published data. We downloaded the samples
GSM614606, GSM614607, GSM614610, and GSM614611 from
the GSE25021 dataset and after adaptor removal and bioinformatics preprocessing of the samples, we used MAQS (liulab.dfci.
harvard.edu/MACS/) to ﬁnd signiﬁcant peaks of ERa interaction. We used UCSC genome browser (http://genome.ucsc.edu)
to map the obtained BED ﬁles, containing the signiﬁcant peaks,
onto the Hg19 human assembly and zoomed on the locus
containing miR-515-5p.
Cell apoptosis assay
Cell apoptosis was determined by measuring the activity of
caspase-3 and -7 (Caspase-Glo 3/7 Assay; Promega). The
culture media from each well was collected; cells were trypsinized and then washed with the respective culture media. The
resulting solution was then mixed and 50 mL was transferred to
a white 96-well plate; 100 mL of Caspase-Glo reagent was added
and incubated in the dark at room temperature for 1 hour. The
luminescence was then measured and normalized to the total
protein, quantiﬁed using BCA Protein Assay Kit (Pierce).
Immunoprecipitation assay
Cell pellets were collected, resuspended in lysis buffer
(20 mmol/L Tris–HCL pH 7.5, 150 mmol/L KCL, 0.5% NP-40,
2 mmol/L EDTA, and 1 mmol/L NaF), and passed three times
through a 25 G needle and once through a 27 G needle. The
lysate was then precleared by being rotated with the beads
(Protein G Sepharose Fast Flow; Sigma) for 2 hours at 4 C. In
parallel, the beads were washed three times (washing buffer:
50 mmol/L Tris–HCL pH 7.5, 300 mmol/L NaCl, 5 mmol/L
MgCl2, and NP-40 0.05%) and then conjugated with 10 mg of
each antibody [monoclonal AGO2 antibody produced in rat
(Sigma); immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody from rat serum
(Sigma)] and heparin (ﬁnal concentration of 1 mg/mL;
AppliChem GmbH) by rotation for 2 hours at 4 C. Next, the
precleared lysate was divided into the appropriate antibodies-beads samples and rotated for 4 hours at 4 C. The beads
were then washed once with lysis buffer and three times with
washing buffer. Next, the beads were reconstituted by adding
proteinase K (New England Biolabs) and DNA was degraded
by adding DNAse (Promega). The RNA fraction was then
isolated by phenol–chloroform (Sigma) extraction and the
RNA was precipitated by adding 100% ethanol and leaving
the samples at 20 C for at least 20 minutes. The RNA pellet
was washed with 70% ethanol and ﬁnally resuspended in
RNase-free water.

miRNA expression
To analyze miRNA expression, TaqMan miRNA Assays
(Applied Biosystems) were used and stem-loop quantitative
reverse transcription (qRT)-PCR was conducted as previously
described (17). Each sample was quantiﬁed in quadruplicate
and using the DDCT method, miRNA expression was normalized to U6 small nuclear RNA expression.
SK1 mRNA expression
To measure SK1 mRNA expression, qRT-PCR was conducted
following the manufacturer's protocol for the PrimerDesign
Gene Detection Kit (PrimerDesign Ltd.). Primer sequences
used are provided in Supplementary Table S4. Gene expression
was normalized to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH).
Protein expression
Protein from each sample (30 mg) was electrophoresed
in a 10% acrylamide gel and then transferred to a polyvinylidene diﬂuoride membrane. The membranes were then
incubated with the primary (phospho-ERK1/2 and GADPH)
and secondary antibodies (mouse IgG). Details of the antibodies are provided in Supplementary Table S5. The protein
bands were ﬁnally detected using Chemiluminescent horseradish peroxidase substrate (Immobilon Western, Millipore
Ltd.).
Analysis of GEO2R and human protein atlas datasets
Using GEO2R (18) on the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO)
database website, we examined a recently published dataset
by Buffa and colleagues (GSE22220; ref. 19). This dataset
contains Illumina miRNA expression proﬁling for a large
cohort of ERa–negative (n ¼ 82) and ERa–positive (n ¼
128) breast cancers. Using Human Protein Atlas (http://
www.proteinatlas.org/), we analyzed ERa and SK1 protein
expression in ERa–negative (n ¼ 31) and ERa–positive (n ¼
26) breast cancer cell lines. Data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism 5.0 (GraphPad Software Inc.).
Statistical analysis
All experiments were carried out independently at least
three times. Data (mean  SEM) were analyzed by Student t
test (unpaired, two-tailed) and correlations were analyzed by
Spearman rank correlation test. All P values less than 0.05 were
considered statistically signiﬁcant.

Results
miR-515-5p directly regulates SK1 levels
Because SK1 has a short 30 -UTR, similar in length to housekeeping genes, we ﬁrst veriﬁed whether SK1 mRNA was
regulated by any miRNAs in breast cancer cell lines. To this
end, we conducted an immunoprecipitation in MCF7 cells
using AGO2 and IgG (negative control) antibodies, and analyzed SK1 mRNA expression in the subsequent RNA isolated
from both immunoprecipitation fractions. We found a significant enrichment of SK1 mRNA levels (P < 0.05; Fig. 1A) in the
AGO2 fraction compared with the IgG fraction. AGO2 is part of

the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) through which
miRNAs are able to regulate gene expression. Therefore, the
presence of SK1 mRNA in the AGO2 fraction suggests the
existence of endogenous miRNAs that can interact directly
with the SK1 30 -UTR and regulate their levels. Next, we used
TargetScan Web-based software to determine which human
miRNAs could potentially target SK1 (Supplementary Fig. S1A).
Because SK1 is oncogenic in breast cancer, among the miRNAs
that potentially interact with its 30 -UTR, we selected only the
ones that are known to act as tumor suppressors or known to
be downregulated in human cancers for further investigation
(Supplementary Table S6). To validate whether these miRNAs
directly target SK1, we cloned the SK1 30 -UTR region into the
pMIR-REPORT vector. Among the nine selected miRNAs, miR206, miR-515-5p, and miR-766 signiﬁcantly reduced luciferase
activity (P < 0.01; P < 0.001, and P < 0.05, respectively), proving
for the ﬁrst time that these miRNAs directly interact with the
SK1 30 -UTR (Fig. 1B). As miR-766 showed the least reduction in
luciferase activity it was not considered further.
To validate SK1 as a direct target of miR-206 and miR-5155p, we next measured SK1 activity levels in MCF7 cells
after overexpression of each miRNA (Fig. 1C). miR-206 and

www.aacrjournals.org

miR-515-5p induced a reduction in SK1 activity of 75% (P <
0.001) and 45% (P < 0.001), respectively. For miR-515-5p, the
decrease in SK1 activity was also accompanied by a minor, but
signiﬁcant reduction in SK1 mRNA levels as expected (P <
0.001; Supplementary Fig. S1B), without any change in activated (phospho-) extracellular signal–regulated kinase (ERK)
expression (Supplementary Fig. S1C).
We then mutated the miR-515-5p seed region in the SK1 30 UTR (at the point detected by the TargetScan analysis) located
in the luciferase plasmid, to evaluate whether miR-515-5p
regulates SK1 by directly binding to this region. miR-515-5p
overexpression signiﬁcantly increased the luciferase activity of
the samples transfected with the plasmid containing the
mutated sequence (pMIR-SK130 -UTRMUT) in comparison with
the cells transfected with the plasmid containing the wild-type
(wt) sequence, proving that miR-515-5p directly targets SK1 by
directly interacting with its 30 -UTR (Supplementary Fig. S1D).
miR-515-5p inhibits breast cancer cell proliferation and
induces apoptosis
Because SK1 mediates cell proliferation in cancer cells (20),
we used MTT assays to determine the effect of miR-206 and

miR-515-5p overexpression on breast cancer cell viability and
proliferation (Fig. 2A). miR-206 overexpression has been previously associated with decreased MCF7 cell viability (21), and
therefore miR-206 was not considered further. miR-515-5p
induced a 70% decrease in MCF7 cell viability (P < 0.001; Fig.
2A), which was accompanied by a signiﬁcant decrease in the
expression of the antiapoptotic Bcl-2 protein (P < 0.01; Fig. 2B).
Therefore, to clarify the cause behind this considerable decrease
in breast cancer cell growth, we conducted Trypan blue (Fig. 2C
and E) and caspase-3/7 activity (Fig. 2D and F) assays to further
evaluate the effect of miR-515-5p on cell viability and apoptosis,
respectively. In two breast cancer cell lines, proliferation was
dramatically inhibited by miR-515-5p (70% of viable MCF7, P <
0.001; 42% of viable ZR-75-1, P < 0.001; Fig. 2C and E, respectively). In addition, the activities of caspase-3 and -7 were
signiﬁcantly increased after 48 hours of treatment, indicating
that apoptosis had been activated by miR-515-5p (in both MCF7
and ZR-75-1 cells; P < 0.001; Fig. 2D and F, respectively).

Silencing SK1 partially rescues the effect of miR-515-5p
inhibition on breast cancer cell proliferation
Next, we investigated the effect of miR-515-5p by loss-offunction on cell proliferation (Fig. 3A) and apoptosis (Fig. 3C).
We observed that inhibition of miR-515-5p in MCF7 cells
caused increased cell proliferation (P < 0.001; Fig. 3A) and a
decrease in apoptosis activation (P < 0.001; Fig. 3C).
To investigate whether an increase in SK1 expression was
mediating this increase in cell proliferation (Fig. 3B) and
inhibition of cell apoptosis (Fig. 3D) caused by anti-miR515-5p treatment, we silenced SK1 using a siRNA (siSK1)
together with miR-515-5p inhibition in MCF7 cells. SK1 silencing induced a decrease in the viability of cells cotransfected
with anti-miR-515-5p compared with siRNA negative control
(siNC; Fig. 3B). However, silencing SK1 was not enough to
rescue the total effect of anti-miR-515-5p [neither the decrease
in cell proliferation (P < 0.01; Fig. 3B), nor the increase in
caspase-7 activity (P < 0.01; Fig. 3D)].

Figure 2. miR-515-5p inhibits
breast cancer cell proliferation.
MCF7 cells were transfected with
50 nmol/L of precursor miRNAs.
After 4 days, MTT assays were
conducted (A) and Bcl-2 protein
expression was measured (B).
Next, viable cells were counted
using Trypan blue (C–E) and
caspase-3/7 activities were
measured in MCF7 and ZR75-1
cells (D and F). Data are presented
as the mean  SEM ( , P < 0.05;

ER Downregulates miR-515-5p–Modulating SK1

Figure 3. SK1 silencing partially rescues the enhanced cell proliferation after miR-515-5p inhibition. Cells were transfected with 200 nmol/L of antimiRNAs and/or 20 nmol/L of siRNAs (Ambion). Viable cells were counted using Trypan blue (A and B) and caspase-3/7 activities were measured over time
(C and D). Data are presented as the mean  SEM (  , P < 0.01;    , P < 0.001). E, FGFR2, PI3K, and TCF7L1 mRNA levels are downregulated by miR-5155p (RNA-Seq validation). MCF7 cells were transfected twice with 50 nmol/L of miR-515-5p over 6 days. FGFR2, PI3K, and TCF7L1 mRNA levels
were then measured by TaqMan qRT-PCR. Data are presented as the mean  SEM ( , P < 0.05).

miR-515-5p targets many oncogenes with an enrichment
of genes belonging to the Wnt pathway
Our data so far indicated that apart from SK1, it is likely that
other oncogenic targets are involved in the tumor suppressor
role of miR-515-5p. To conﬁrm this hypothesis, we overexpressed miR-515-5p continuously in breast cancer cells for 6
days and conducted RNA-Seq analysis ﬁrst to identify other
targets of this miRNA and second, to evaluate whether any of
these regulated transcripts are involved in cell proliferation
(Supplementary Table S7). Notably, SylArray analysis (http://
www.ebi.ac.uk/enright-srv/sylarray/) indicated that the down-

www.aacrjournals.org

regulated transcripts are signiﬁcantly enriched with miR-515-5p
"seeds" (Supplementary Fig. S3), indicating that there were direct
targets among the downregulated genes. To identify the highconﬁdence direct targets among these, we considered transcripts that were commonly downregulated (<1.2-fold)
between two replicates and that were predicted as potential
targets by TargetScan. This analysis identiﬁed 212 high-conﬁdence miR-515-5p directly regulated transcripts (Supplementary
Table S7). Interestingly, Gene Ontology (GO) terms and pathway
enrichment analysis identiﬁed apoptosis and Wnt pathways as
signiﬁcantly regulated by this miRNA (Supplementary Table S7).

Interestingly, among the genes downregulated by miR-5155p that also belong to the Wnt signaling pathway, all are known
to positively regulate cell proliferation. BCL9 improves b-catenin–mediated transcription (22); DIXDC1 targets p21 and
cyclin D1 through the activation of the phosphoinositide 3kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway (23); FRAT2 activates b-catenin–
TCF signaling pathway (24); FZD4 is a mediator of the ERG
oncogene–induced Wnt signaling (25); and TCF7L1 is a transcription factor activated by b-catenin that mediates Wnt
signaling (26). In addition, we identiﬁed important genes that
have been shown to promote breast cancer, such as FGFR2 and
PIK3C2B (27, 28), and these seem to be directly regulated by
miR-515-5p. We further validated miR-515-5p–mediated regulation of a few of these genes (TCF7L1, FGFR2, and PIK3C2B)
by using qRT-PCR (Fig. 3E). Thus, we show here that although
SK1 plays an important role in miR-515-5p cell proliferation
regulation, it is not the only gene regulated by miR-515-5p that
is responsible for its effects on cancer cell proliferation.
ERa and SK1 expression is positively correlated
To evaluate whether ERa and SK1 expression is correlated,
we analyzed two publically available datasets, one from the
GEO database (mRNA levels) and one from THPA (The Human
Protein Atlas) immunohistochemistry database (protein
levels). A signiﬁcant, but weak, positive correlation was
observed between ERa and SK1 mRNA expression in ERa–
positive breast cancers (R ¼ 0.181; P ¼ 0.0233; Fig. 4A). In
support of this ﬁnding, we also observed a signiﬁcant and
stronger positive correlation between ERa and SK1 protein
expression in ERa–positive breast cancer cell lines (R ¼ 0.352;
P ¼ 0.0389; Fig. 4B). This observation has reinforced our
hypothesis that the two genes are correlated through miR515-5p regulation. Furthermore, and also consistent with this
ﬁnding, we found that miR-515-5p had a stronger effect
inhibiting protein translation, compared with mRNA destabilization in our in vitro assays; it reduces SK1 mRNA up to
approximately 15% (Supplementary Fig. S1B) and SK1 activity
expression to up to approximately 60% (Fig. 1C).
Interestingly, and in line with our hypothesis, ERa and SK1
mRNA and protein expression were not signiﬁcantly correlated
in ERa–negative breast cancers and ERa–negative cell lines
(Fig. 4A and B).
miR-515-5p expression is downregulated by E2
Previous studies have reported that SK1 mediates the estrogen-dependent tumorigenesis of MCF7 cells (29). However, the
molecular processes underlying the upregulation of SK1
expression by E2 are still unclear. We hypothesized that
miR-515-5p expression could be downregulated by an E2associated mechanism, and therefore E2 may upregulate SK1.
To test this hypothesis, we measured miR-515-5p expression
and SK1 activity levels in MCF7 cells treated with 10 nmol/L of
E2. Remarkably, we found that E2 signiﬁcantly downregulated
miR-515-5p levels in a time course experiment (up to 60%
reduction at 48 hours; P < 0.001; Fig. 4C) and induced a biphasic
upregulation of SK1 activity: an early 4-fold upregulation
occurred after 6 hours of E2 treatment (P < 0.05), followed by
a later 2-fold upregulation after 48 hours of E2 treatment (P <

0.05; Fig. 4D; Supplementary Fig. S2A). We also observed a
reduction in miR-515-5p levels after E2 treatment in another
ERa–positive breast cancer cell line (ZR-75-1; Supplementary
Fig. S2B). Because the upregulation of SK1 after 6 hours of E2
treatment (Fig. 4D) could not be explained by miR-515-5p–
mediated regulation, as no signiﬁcant change in miR-515-5p
expression was observed until 12 hours from the E2 treatment
(Fig. 4C), we next veriﬁed whether SK1 activation by E2, at 48
hours, was caused by the downregulation of miR-515-5p. To do
this, we measured SK1 activity levels in MCF7 cells transfected
with miR-515-5p precursor (overexpression), together with E2
treatment (Fig. 4E). When miR-515-5p is overexpressed, SK1
activity levels are not altered by E2, thus proving that the
increase in SK1 activity after E2 treatment is caused by loss of
miR-515-5p (Fig. 4E).
SK1 activity downregulation by tamoxifen requires
miR-515-5p
To further validate our hypothesis that miR-515-5p is
required for E2-dependent SK1 expression, we measured SK1
activity and miR-515-5p levels in MCF7 cells treated with 100
nmol/L tamoxifen. Notably, miR-515-5p expression was signiﬁcantly upregulated by tamoxifen (2.8-fold at 24 hours; P <
0.01; Fig. 5A). This indicated that ERa is involved in the
downregulation of miR-515-5p by E2 treatment. In addition
to the upregulation of miR-515-5p, we observed a signiﬁcant
reduction of SK1 activity in MCF7 cells treated with tamoxifen
(P < 0.001; Fig. 5B and Supplementary Fig. S2C and S2D), but
not in MCF7 cells that were treated with tamoxifen and antimiR-515-5p (Fig. 5B). The absence of a response in SK1 activity
to tamoxifen in the presence of a miR-515-5p inhibitor suggests
that this miRNA is required for the downregulation in SK1
activity caused by the antiestrogen tamoxifen (Fig. 5B).
To further investigate the effect of tamoxifen on miR-5155p levels, we next conducted an immunoprecipitation of
AGO2 in MCF7 cells treated with tamoxifen and extracted
total RNA from the immunoprecipitation (Fig. 5C). qRT-PCR
showed that miR-515-5p levels in the RNA bound to AGO2
were signiﬁcantly higher in the MCF7 cells treated with
tamoxifen, compared with the levels measured in the cells
treated with ethanol (4-fold; P < 0.05; Fig. 5C). Therefore, not
only were miR-515-5p levels upregulated after the tamoxifen
treatment, but miR-515-5p was also recruited to the RISC
where AGO2 is known to be responsible for the silencing of
sequence-speciﬁc transcripts.
miR-515-5p levels are not altered in ERa–negative breast
cancer cells after E2 and tamoxifen treatment
Next, we analyzed the effect of E2 and tamoxifen on miR-5155p expression and SK1 activity in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer
cells, which unlike MCF7 cells, do not express the ERa. This
showed that miR-515-5p and SK1 activity levels were unaltered
after both treatments (Figs. 4F and G and 5D and E).
ERa mediates miR-515-5p downregulation by E2 by
directly binding to its promoter region
To determine the mechanism by which ERa regulates miR515-5p expression levels (Figs. 4 and 5), we reanalyzed the

ER Downregulates miR-515-5p–Modulating SK1

Figure 4. miR-515-5p downregulation mediates the increase in SK1 activity caused by E2. A and B, miR-515-5p levels are upregulated in ERa–positive
breast tumors compared with ERa–negative tumors. A positive and signiﬁcant correlation between ERa and SK1 expression was observed using
two public mRNA and protein datasets (GEO2R and THPA). A and B, the mRNA analysis (A) was conducted in RNA isolated from 216 breast
tumors (ERa–negative, n ¼ 82; ERa–positive, n ¼ 128) and the protein analysis (B) was conducted in protein isolated from 57 breast cancer cell lines
(ERa–negative, n ¼ 31; ERa–positive, n ¼ 26). C and D, after 72 hours of starvation, MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 were treated with 10 nmol/L
E2 and ethanol (negative control). miR-515-5p expression was measured by qRT-PCR (C), and SK1 activity levels (D) were measured in MCF7 treated
with E2 after 3, 6, 12, 24, and 48 hours. For each time point, miR-515-5p/SK1 activity levels represent the ratio between the values for E2 and ethanol.

published ChIP-Seq data from MCF7 cells (sequencing data at
ArrayExpress accession number E-TABM-828 or GEO accession number GSE25021; ref. 30). E2 treatment induced 116.77fold enrichment of ERa (Bonferroni-corrected P ¼ 0.00) close
to the transcription start site (TSS) of miR-515-5p (Fig. 6A).
Accordingly, the level of ERa on the same site was substantially
reduced after vehicle treatment (23.78-fold; Bonferroni-corrected P ¼ 0.24; Fig. 6A), indicating that E2 induces the binding
of ERa on the miR-515-5p promoter. Therefore, to conﬁrm the
importance of ERa in the downregulation of miR-515-5p, we
silenced ERa and measured miR-515-5p levels. Consistent with
our proposed mechanism, this led to a dose response increase
of miR-515-5p levels (Fig. 6B and C), providing further evidence
that the binding of ERa to the miR-515-5p gene promoter
downregulates mature miR-515-5p expression. Importantly, E2
treatment induced a signiﬁcant decrease in the luciferase
activity of a reporter construct transfected into MCF-7 cells,
which contained the miR-515-5p promoter sequence, indicat-

ing that the binding of ERa to this region actually results in
downregulation of upstream genes. This ﬁnding reinforces our
hypothesis that ERa reduces miR-515-5p levels by directly
binding to its promoter (Fig. 6D).
Ex vivo analysis reveals downregulated miR-515-5p levels
in ERa–positive breast tumors compared with ERa–
negative breast tumors
To prove the clinical relevance of our ﬁndings, we correlated
miR-515-5p expression with the presence of ERa in breast
tumors (Fig. 7A). In accordance with our in vitro ﬁndings (i.e.,
miR-515-5p downregulation is mediated by E2 via ERa), miR515-5p levels were found to be signiﬁcantly lower in ERa–
positive breast tumors compared with ERa–negative lesions
(P < 0.01; Fig. 7A). In addition, we used a publically available
dataset (19) to assess the relationship between miR-515-5p and
ERa status. Consistent with our in vitro and ex vivo data, we
found that in a large cohort of breast cancer patients, miR-515-

5p expression was signiﬁcantly lower in ERa–positive tumors,
whereas there was no association between miR-515-3p (guide
strand) levels and ERa status (Supplementary Fig. S5).

Discussion
By screening miRNAs that are predicted to regulate SK1, we
identiﬁed that miR-515-5p directly interacted with SK1 30 -UTR
and regulated its expression (Fig. 1). We found that miR-515-5p
expression was downregulated by estrogen in two different
breast cancer cell lines (MCF7 and ZR75-1) with a concomitant
biphasic activation of SK1 (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Fig. S2B).

www.aacrjournals.org

Transient transfection with precursor miR-515-5p abrogated
the later stimulation of SK1 activity (48 hours) by estrogen. This
highlighted miR-515-5p as a potential, previously unidentiﬁed
link, between estrogen and SK1-mediated oncogenesis. Conversely, tamoxifen, which antagonizes estrogen action, upregulated miR-515-5p expression, and SK1 activity was subsequently reduced. Following silencing of miR-515-5p in ERa–
positive MCF7 cells treated with tamoxifen, we did not observe
any change in SK1 activity levels (Fig. 5), suggesting that
reduced levels of miR-515-5p are required for the upregulation
of SK1 after estrogen stimulation. Because tamoxifen has been
described to have an antagonistic effect on the activation of

scheme of the proposed
mechanism: after its activation by

loss of mature miR-515-5p leads to
a derepression and increase of
SK1 activity, which then promotes
cell viability by inhibiting apoptosis.

several ERs (31), we hypothesized that ERa mediates the
estrogen-induced downregulation of miR-515-5p. In MDAMB-231 cells, miR-515-5p expression is not altered upon
estrogen or tamoxifen treatment (Figs. 4 and 5). The absence
of the effect of both treatments in these cells, which express ERb, but not ERa, indicated that ERa was the mediator of the
downregulation and upregulation of miR-515-5p induced by
estrogens and tamoxifen, respectively (32). In accordance with
our experimental ﬁndings, our patient data also showed that
miR-515-5p expression is signiﬁcantly higher in ERa–negative
breast cancers, compared with ERa–positive breast cancers
(Fig. 7). This indicated again the importance of ERa expression
in regulating miR-515-5p levels and also the potential clinical
relevance of this study.
miR-515-5p belongs to the C19MC cluster (chromosome
19 miRNA cluster), which is the largest miRNA cluster
discovered in the human genome so far. This cluster is an
imprinted primate-speciﬁc chromosomal domain, which
means that only one of the allelic copies is expressed
(33). A deregulation of an imprinted domain has severe
repercussions in many diseases, for example NOEY2 is an
imprinted gene whose loss of expression is linked to an
increased risk of ovarian and breast cancer (34). In MCF7

5946

Cancer Res; 73(19) October 1, 2013

cells, treatment with the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor
5-azacytidine (5-aza) reactivates the expression of 20 of
576 (3%) human miRNAs, 14 of which are located in
the C19MC cluster (35). Therefore, DNA methylation might
be the epigenetic process by which estrogen/tamoxifen
regulate miR-515-5p expression in breast cancer, but this
would require further experimental demonstration.
By reanalyzing published ChIP-Seq data (30), we found that
one of the ERa–enriched zones in the MCF7 genome (examined after E2 treatment) corresponds to the C19MC cluster
promoter, indicating that this particular region is responsible
for the miR-515-5p transcription downregulation after E2
treatment. Therefore, the upregulation of miR-515-5p expression when ERa is silenced (Fig. 6), together with our ﬁndings in
ERa–negative MDA-MB-231 cells (Figs. 4 and 5) and the
clinical data (Fig. 7), points to ERa as the mediator for miR515-5p transcriptional repression upon E2 treatment. Because
we showed that ERa speciﬁcally interacts upstream of the
TSS of a cluster of miRNAs, which are probably derived from
the processing of a unique primary transcript, then the other
miRNAs belonging to this cluster may also participate in the
ERa–mediated cell proliferation mechanism. However, this
also would require further investigation.

ER Downregulates miR-515-5p–Modulating SK1

Although we showed a positive correlation between ERa
and SK1, which could be mediated by miR-515-5p (Fig. 4), the
negative effect of miR-515-5p on cell proliferation could not be
explained only due to the negative regulation of SK1 by miR515-5p. In accordance with this hypothesis, we showed that
silencing SK1 only partially rescues the effect of miR-515-5p
inhibition on breast cancer cell proliferation (Fig. 3). These
ﬁndings strongly indicate that miR-515-5p also regulates other
genes involved in cell proliferation regulation in addition to
SK1. RNA-Seq assessment of the transcriptome after miR-5155p overexpression revealed that genes that positively regulate
Wnt signaling and also contain the seed region for miR-515-5p
interaction in their 30 -UTRs were signiﬁcantly downregulated
(Supplementary Table S7). In addition, other important oncogenes that contain a miR-515-5p seed region and were downregulated by this miRNA, include FGFR2, which promotes
breast tumorigenicity through maintenance of breast
tumor-initiating cells (27), and interleukin-6 receptor (IL6R), which induces STAT-3 activation and the production of
the antiapoptotic proteins bcl-xl and BCL2 (36).
Apart from having a critical role in breast cancer tumor
growth and formation, estrogens and the ER have been
described to be responsible for breast cancer chemoresistance.
Because ERa–positive tumors represent the majority of all
breast cancers, understanding the mechanisms involved in
ERa–mediated breast cancer chemoresistance is essential to
ﬁnding novel treatments of resistant-tumors. Cell apoptosis is
one of the pathways whose dysregulation has been associated
with breast cancer chemoresistance (37). Here, we have elucidated one of the mechanisms by which estrogen downregulates
cell apoptosis and induces cell proliferation. By downregulating
miR-515-5p, estrogen upregulates SK1 activity and the expression of many others oncogenes, which then stimulate cell
survival by inhibiting cell apoptosis (Figs. 2 and 3).
We have conducted the ﬁrst functional studies to evaluate
the role of miR-515-5p in cancer and highlighted its therapeutic potential for the treatment of breast cancer. Reexpression

of miR-515-5p was found to dramatically inhibit breast cancer
cell proliferation and induce caspase-dependent apoptosis
(Fig. 2). Therefore, in ERa–positive breast cancers, miR-5155p replacement could stop the stimulation of cell growth by
estrogen and may be an adjunct to current antiestrogen
therapies.
