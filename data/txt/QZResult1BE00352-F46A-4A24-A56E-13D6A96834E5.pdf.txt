Japan Adult Leukemia Study Group

BACKGROUND: Contemporary treatment protocols for adult acute myeloid leukemia (AML) are age-specific, and older patients are
generally treated less intensively than younger patients. However, it remains uncertain whether older but fit patients with AML really
need to have their treatment attenuated. METHODS: To evaluate the contribution of age to outcome for patients with AML receiving
intensive chemotherapy, data were analyzed for 2276 patients aged less than 65 years who were treated uniformly, regardless of age,
in 3 consecutive prospective studies conducted by the Japan Adult Leukemia Study Group. RESULTS: A substantial drop in overall
survival (OS) between patients aged 40 to 49 years and 50 to 64 years led to a focus on 2 comparisons: 1) age < 50 versus  50
years; and 2) age 50 to 54 versus 55 to 59 versus 60 to 64 years. OS was significantly better for patients aged < 50 years than that
for those aged  50 years (49.6% and 37.0% at 5 years; P <.001); older patients were more susceptible to relapse, but not to early
death or nonrelapse mortality. The significant differences in OS between these 2 age groups were equally seen for patients with
favorable, intermediate, and adverse cytogenetics (P <.001 each). Outcomes for those aged 50 to 54, 55 to 59, and 60 to 64 years
were similar, with 5-year OS rates of 38.2%, 35.1%, and 38.0%, respectively (P 5.934), and no differences in early death or nonrelapse
mortality were observed among these age groups. CONCLUSIONS: These findings justify the use of intensive chemotherapy without

INTRODUCTION
Age is among the most important prognostic factors in acute myeloid leukemia (AML).1-5 Increasing age in AML is associated with a higher frequency of unfavorable biological characteristics such as adverse cytogenetics, preceding myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), and expression of the multidrug resistance phenotype, all of which are involved in intrinsic
resistance to chemotherapy.6-9 In addition to the disease biology, patient-related factors such as poor general condition
and significant comorbidities also contribute to inferior outcomes for older patients.8,10,11 Because of such distinct biological and clinical features, contemporary treatment protocols for adult AML are age-specific and are typically divided into
those for younger and older patients, with older patients treated less intensively than younger patients. For this purpose,
age 55 or 60 years is generally used as the demarcation between these 2 groups1,2; however, this cutoff age is quite arbitrary,
and it remains uncertain whether patients over such age limits really need to have their treatment attenuated.
For the recent prospective AML studies conducted by the Japan Adult Leukemia Study Group (JALSG), age less
than 65 years was used as the eligibility criterion, with dose modifications not having been adopted according to age. This

Contribution of Age to Outcome for AML/Yanada et al

situation provides a welcome opportunity to evaluate the
contribution of age to outcome for patients with AML
treated with uniform intensive chemotherapy. For the
study reported here, we integrated data for 2276 patients
entered into 3 consecutive prospective studies between
1995 and 2005 for a comparison of patient characteristics
and treatment outcomes among different age groups.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients

All patients were subjects of one of the three phase 3 studies conducted by the JALSG, that is, the AML95 (from
1995-1997),12 AML97 (from 1997-2001),13,14 and
AML201 (from 2001-2005) studies.15,16 All of these
studies adopted the same eligibility criteria: newly diagnosed AML (acute promyelocytic leukemia excluded), age
15 to 64, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0 to 3, adequate functioning of the liver
(serum bilirubin level < 2.0 mg/L), kidneys (serum creatinine level < 2.0 mg/dL), lungs (PaO2  60 Torr or SpO2
 93%), and heart (no significant abnormalities on electrocardiograms and echocardiograms). Patients with
AML secondary to MDS or cytotoxic treatment were not
eligible for enrollment. Written informed consent was
obtained from all patients prior to registration. Each protocol was reviewed and approved by the institutional
review boards of the participating centers, and was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.
Treatments

The treatment schedule for each study is described in
detail elsewhere.12-16 The AML95 study compared a fixed
schedule (ie, “317”) and an individualized schedule (up
to “4110” depending on the bone marrow findings on
day 8) for induction therapy with idarubicin and cytarabine.12 Postremission therapy consisted of 3 courses of
consolidation therapy including behenoyl cytarabine and
12 months of maintenance therapy. The AML97 study
adopted the 317 induction therapy with idarubicin and
cytarabine for all patients.13,14 After achieving complete
remission (CR), patients were randomized to receive 3 or
4 consolidation courses that included standard-dose cytarabine, followed by 12 months of maintenance therapy
only for the 3 courses. Those with a human leukocyte
antigen (HLA)-identical sibling donor were assigned to
allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) if
they were younger than 50 years and at intermediate or
poor risk, as determined with a scoring system which took
into account cytogenetics, white blood cell count, and
other factors. The AML201 study compared idarubicin
Cancer

(12 mg/m2 for 3 days) and daunorubicin (50 mg/m2 for 5
days) both combined with cytarabine for induction therapy.14,15 Patients in CR were randomly assigned to either
4 consolidation courses with standard-dose cytarabine or
3 courses with high-dose cytarabine. Allogeneic HCT was
offered to patients aged 50 or younger if they presented
with intermediate or adverse cytogenetics and had an
HLA-identical sibling donor. In principle, doses were not
modified according to age for any protocol. The single
exception was for high-dose cytarabine in the AML201
study, in which reduction of the cytarabine dose from 2 g/
m2 to 1.5 g/m2 was allowed for patients aged 60 years or
older.
Definitions

Karyotypes were classified as favorable, intermediate, or
adverse, in line with the revised UK Medical Research
Council (MRC) criteria.17 Monosomal karyotype was
defined according to the criteria developed by Breems
et al.18
CR was defined as the presence of all of the following: < 5% of blasts in bone marrow, no leukemic blasts in
peripheral blood or extramedullary sites, and recovery of
peripheral blood counts. Early death was defined as death
from any cause occurring within 30 days after the start of
induction therapy.8 Overall survival (OS) was defined as
the time from the start of treatment to death or last visit,
and relapse-free survival as the time from CR to relapse,
death or last visit. Patients undergoing allogeneic HCT
were not censored at the time of transplantation unless
indicated.
Statistical Analysis

Distributions of patient characteristics between and among
groups were compared by using the chi-square test for categorical variables. Differences in continuous variables were
compared by means of the Wilcoxon rank-sum test for distribution between 2 groups, and the Kruskal-Wallis test for
distribution among 3 groups. The probabilities of OS and
relapse-free survival were estimated by using the KaplanMeier method, with differences between groups qualified
with the log-rank test. First, we examined OS by dividing
patients into 4 age groups: 15-29, 30-39, 40-49, and 50-64
years. This provisional analysis disclosed a substantial drop
in OS between patients aged 40-49 and 50-64 years
(Fig. 1A). This finding led us to focus on 2 comparisons for
subsequent analyses: 1) age < 50 versus  50 years; and 2)
age 50 to 54 versus 55 to 59 versus 60 to 64 years. Relapse
and nonrelapse mortality were considered as competing
risk events for each other, and the probabilities of relapse

but significantly for patients aged < 50 and  50
(P < .001), but the difference was not significant for those
aged 50 to 54, 54 to 59, and 60 to 64 years (P 5 .577).
Comparison of patients aged < 50 and  50 years showed
that t(8;21) and inv(16)/t(16;16) occurred more frequently in younger patients (P < .001 and P 5 .043,
respectively), whereas the frequencies of add(5q)/
del(5q)/-5, add(7q)/del(7q)/-7, complex karyotype, and
monosomal karyotype were higher for older patients
(P 5 .002, P 5 .021, P < .001 and P < .001, respectively). None of these cytogenetic aberrations, however,
showed significant differences in distribution among
those aged 50 to 54, 54 to 59, and 60 to 64 years.
Complete Remission and Early Death

Figure 1. Overall survival for (A) the entire cohort and (B) for
patients 50 to 64 years, is shown by age group. First,
patients aged 15 to 29 (N 5 438), 30 to 39 (N 5 391), 40 to 49
(N 5 510), and 50 to 64 (N 5 937) are compared, and those
aged 50 to 64 are then divided into 3 groups: 50 to 54
(N 5 334), 55 to 59 (N 5 322), and 60 to 64 (N 5 281).

and nonrelapse mortality were estimated by using the
cumulative incidence functions, with differences between
groups qualified by the Gray test. The Cox proportional
hazards regression model was used for multivariate analysis,
and a hazard ratio (HR) was calculated in conjunction with
a 95% confidence interval (CI). All statistical analyses were
performed by using Stata version 12.0 software (StataCorp,
College Station, Tex).
RESULTS
Patient Characteristics

A total of 2276 patients (430 from AML95, 789 from
AML97, and 1057 from AML201) were analyzed for this
study, with a median follow-up of surviving patients of
4.2 years (range, 0.0-8.0 years). Table 1 shows baseline
characteristics of the patients according to age groups
(age < 50, 50-54, 55-59, and 60-64 years). There was no
significant relationship between performance status and
age. The distribution of cytogenetic risk differed modestly
3328

Rates of CR and early death are summarized in Table 2.
Patients younger than 50 years tended to show higher CR
rates than those aged 50 or older, but the difference failed
to reach statistical significance (P 5 .078), whereas there
was no difference in the CR rates among those aged 50 to
54, 54 to 59, and 60 to 64 years (P 5 .829). Early death
within 30 days after the start of induction therapy
occurred in 1.8%, 1.5%, 2.5%, and 3.2% of patients aged
< 50, 50 to 54, 55 to 59, and 60 to 64 years, respectively,
with no significant difference between those aged < 50
and  50 (P 5 .367), or among those aged 50 to 54, 54 to
59, and 60 to 64 (P 5 .356). The rates of death within 60
days were 2.7%, 5.1%, 5.0%, and 6.1% for the respective
age groups (P 5 .003 for age < 50 and  50, and
P 5 .813 for age 50 to 54, 54 to 59, and 60 to 64 years).
Relapse and Nonrelapse Mortality

Cumulative incidences of relapse and nonrelapse mortality for the 1788 patients who attained CR are shown in
Table 2. Patients 50 years of age or older were more likely
to experience relapse than were those younger than 50
(P 5 .008), whereas there was no difference in relapse
rates among those aged 50-54, 55-59, and 60-64 years
(P 5 .196). The nonrelapse mortality rates did not differ
significantly between patients aged < 50 and  50 years
(P 5 .695), or among those aged 50 to 54, 54 to 59, and
60 to 64 years (P 5 .388).
Overall Survival

Figure 1A compares OS for patients divided into 4 age
groups: 15 to 29, 30 to 39, 40 to 49, and 50 to 64 years.
As mentioned above, this result prompted us to first postulate a distinction between patients younger and older
than 50 years. OS was significantly better for patients
aged < 50 years than that for those aged  50 years

(49.6% and 37.0% at 5 years, P < .001). Among those
aged  50, however, increasing age did not seem to affect
OS, because survival curves for patients aged 50 to 54,
55 to 59, and 60 to 64 years were superimposed, with
5-year OS rates of 38.2%, 35.1%, and 38.0%, respectively (P 5 .934; Fig. 1B).
To evaluate whether the difference in OS
between those aged < 50 and  50 years depends on
cytogenetic risk, comparisons between these 2 groups
were made within each cytogenetic risk group. This
analysis showed that the intergroup difference was
significant for favorable (P < .001; Fig. 2A), intermediate (P < .001; Fig. 2B), and adverse cytogenetic risk
(P < .001, Fig. 2C). The effect of age on OS
remained significant in a multivariate analysis adjusting for other covariates (Table 3). Allogeneic HCT

was performed for 687 (51%) of the patients aged

58 (18%) of those aged 55 to 59 years, and 19 (7%)
of those aged 60 to 64 years. Censoring the findings
for these patients at the time of allogeneic HCT did
not alter the main results; Kaplan-Meier survival
curves with censoring of patients undergoing allogeneic HCT are shown for those aged < 50 and  50
years in Fig. 3.
Finally, we examined whether lack of significant
interaction between age and OS in patients aged 50 to 64
years remains after adjusting for other potentially confounding factors. When a multivariate analysis was undertaken for these older patients by including the covariates
listed in Table 3, age group had no impact on OS

patients aged 60-64 years; both with reference to those
aged 50-54 years).
DISCUSSION
To investigate how increasing age affects outcomes for
patients with newly diagnosed AML, we analyzed data for
2276 patients 15 to 64 years of age who were treated uniformly, regardless of age, in 3 consecutive prospective
AML studies by JALSG. This large-scale retrospective
analysis yielded several relevant findings: 1) age 50 was a
significant dividing point for outcomes; 2) patients aged
50 to 64 years were more susceptible to relapse, but not to
early death or nonrelapse mortality than those younger
than 50 years; and 3) outcomes did not differ among
patients aged 50 to 54, 55 to 59, and 60 to 64 years.
Why were the survival rates for patients 50 years
of age or older in our study significantly inferior to
those of patients younger than 50? Our data indicate
that worse outcomes for older patients resulted from
higher relapse rates. In AML, it has been well established that cytogenetic findings at diagnosis are associated with the risk of relapse.17-20 Comparison of
the frequencies of distinct cytogenetic aberrations
showed that younger patients were more likely to exhibit favorable cytogenetics such as t(8;21) and
inv(16)/t(16;16), whereas older patients were more
likely to show adverse cytogenetics such as abnormalities of chromosome 5 or 7, complex karyotype, and
monosomal karyotype. However, such a difference in
the distribution of cytogenetics alone could not have
accounted for the difference in outcomes between
patients aged < 50 and  50 years observed in this
study, because the significant differences in OS
3330

between these 2 age groups were seen for all cytogenetic risk groups.
Moreover, it could be expected that allogeneic HCT
would result in more favorable outcomes for younger
patients. However, although the proportion of patients
who had undergone allogeneic HCT was indeed higher
among younger than older patients, censoring the findings obtained at the time of allogeneic HCT produced no
major changes in the study results. Therefore, it seems
that neither cytogenetics nor allogeneic HCT can explain
why older patients suffered relapse more frequently than
younger patients. Secondary AML could not have been
the reason, either, because our study cohort consisted of
only patients with de novo AML. Other mechanisms that
had not been studied here, such as molecular profiles, may
play a significant role in differences in outcomes for
younger and older patients.21-24
The analytic results for data of patients 50 years of
age or older in our study also provide insights into the
treatment of older patients with AML. Patients aged 50 to
54, 55 to 59, and 60 to 64 years had similar long-term survival, and no differences in early death or nonrelapse mortality were observed among them. This finding calls into
question whether older patients really need to be treated
differently. Recently, Lowenberg et al compared the effect
of a doubled dose of daunorubicin of 90 mg/m2 with that
of a conventional dose of 45 mg/m2 in the context of the
317 regimen for patients aged 60 years or older.25
Although no difference in outcome was observed overall,
patients between 60 and 65 years of age significantly benefited from the doubled dose of daunorubicin. Taking
these results into account, older and fit patients, especially
those under the age of 65 years, may still benefit from
intensified chemotherapy.

Figure 2. Overall survival for patients with each cytogenetic
risk is shown by age group. Patients with (A) favorable
(N 5 515), (B) intermediate (N 5 1461), and (C) adverse
(N 5 229) cytogenetics are shown separately.

When interpreting our data, we should bear in mind
that our study cohort consisted exclusively of newly diagnosed AML patients under the age of 65 years who were
entered into phase 3 studies. In addition, our cohort did
not include patients with AML secondary to MDS or
cytotoxic treatment. Secondary AML accounts for
approximately 35% of the whole AML population,26,27
and the frequency is even higher among older patients.3,5

Figure 3. Overall survival is shown by age group with censoring of patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic cell
transplantation. Patients aged 15 to 49 (N 5 1339) and 50 to
64 years (N 5 937) are compared, with those undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation censored at the
time of transplantation.

Our results therefore might not be applicable to the
general AML population. This limitation may well be
partly complemented by the findings of several previous
studies. Buchner et al analyzed data of 2776 patients with
de novo AML with no upper age enrolled onto 2 prospective studies by the German AML Cooperative Group.9
In that study, OS for patients older than 60 years was only
half that of younger patients, and this difference was attributable to less frequent CR and more frequent relapse
in older patients. It seems likely that inclusion of elderly
3331

patients might have contributed to a larger prognostic
difference between younger and older patients. By using
the combined data of 5 AML studies conducted by the
Southwest Oncology Group, Appelbaum et al evaluated
effect of age on outcomes.8 Their study included not only
patients with de novo AML but also those with secondary
AML, with no upper age limit employed in trials for older
patients. CR rates and OS were shown to worsen with
advanced age, and this held true even if patients aged 56
to 65, 66 to 75, and older than 75 years were compared.
It is conceivable that discrepant results among these studies, including ours, could be a reflection of differences in
analyzed patient population. Through an entirely different approach, Juliusson et al evaluated the effect of age on
outcomes for AML by using data for 2767 unselected
patients with AML who were consecutively enrolled in
the Swedish Acute Leukemia Registry.11 They showed
that intensive chemotherapy was associated with
improved survival even for elderly patients, although it
should be remembered that patients in that study were
treated heterogeneously, and the choice of treatment must
have been dependent on known and unknown confounding factors. Our study, in contrast, is advantageous in that
the study population consisted of patients who were
treated homogeneously regardless of age.
To summarize, we analyzed data for a large number
of patients with AML aged 15 to 64 years who were
treated uniformly in the context of clinical studies, and
could not determine a specific age limit over which
attenuation of treatment intensity is advisable. Our results
justify the use of intensive chemotherapy without dose
attenuation toward older but fit AML patients at least up
to the age of 64.
