Abstract
her2/neu

To investigate the role of p185
/ErbB3 signaling in
pituitary tumor function, we examined these receptors in
human prolactinomas. Immunofluorescent p185her2/neu was
detected in almost all (seven of eight), and ErbB3 expression
in a subset ( four of eight) of tumors (seven adenomas and one
carcinoma). Quantitative PCR also showed abundant ErbB3
mRNA in tumor specimens derived from a rarely encountered
prolactin-cell carcinoma. Activation of p185c-neu /ErbB3
signaling with heregulin, the ErbB3 ligand, in rat lactosomatotroph (GH4C1) tumor cells specifically induced
prolactin (PRL) mRNA expression f5-fold and PRL secretion
f4-fold, whereas growth hormone expression was unchanged.
Heregulin (6 nmol/L) induced tyrosine phosphorylation and
ErbB3 and p185c-neu heterodimerization, with subsequent
activation of intracellular ERK and Akt. The Akt signal was
specific to ErbB3 activation by heregulin, and was not
observed in response to epidermal growth factor activation
of epidermal growth factor receptor. Gefitinib, the tyrosine
kinase inhibitor, suppressed heregulin-mediated p185c-neu/
ErbB3 signaling to PRL. Heregulin induction of PRL was also
abrogated by transfecting cells with short interfering RNA
directed against ErbB3. Pharmacologic inhibition of heregulin-induced phosphoinositide-3-kinase/Akt (with LY294002)
and ERK (with U0126) signaling, as well as short interfering
RNA–mediated mitogen-activated protein kinase-1 downregulation, showed ERK signaling as the primary transducer
of heregulin signaling to PRL. These results show ErbB3
expression in human prolactinomas and a novel ErbB3mediated mechanism for PRL regulation in experimental
lactotroph tumors. Targeted inhibition of up-regulated
p185c-neu/ErbB3 activity could be useful for the treatment of
aggressive prolactinomas resistant to conventional therapy.

Introduction
Prolactinomas arising from pituitary lactotrophs account for
f40% of all pituitary tumors (1, 2). Excess prolactin (PRL)
secretion may lead to infertility, sexual dysfunction, and osteoporosis (1). Prolactinoma mass effects may lead to local compressive
symptoms including visual field defects and hypopituitarism.
Tumorous lactotrophs usually express functional dopamine (D2)
receptors, enabling medical therapy with dopamine agonists to

suppress PRL synthesis and secretion and tumor growth (1). However,
dopamine agonist resistance encountered in a subset of patients
with PRL-secreting pituitary adenomas limits therapeutic efficacy (3).
Effective treatments are also needed for invasive refractory macroprolactinomas and for those aggressive tumors rarely undergoing
malignant transformation resulting in a poor prognosis (4–6).
Mechanisms underlying pituitary tumor aggressive behavior and
malignant transformation are largely unclear. Dopamine agonist
resistance may be due to decreased D2 receptor or differential
isoform expression, and or disrupted autocrine growth factor
signaling (1, 3). ErbB receptors are comprised of four subtypes
(EGFR, p185her2/neu, ErbB3, and ErbB4; ref. 7), and the kinasedeficient ErbB3 requires dimerization with p185her2/neu to affect
signaling (8). Reports of increased ErbB receptor member
expression, particularly in aggressive pituitary tumors and pituitary
carcinomas (9–13), could reflect tumor progression to a more
dedifferentiated state and associated loss of growth control. For
such patients, targeted ErbB receptor inhibition could provide an
alternative medical control of tumor growth and or hormone
secretion, as recently shown for experimental rat prolactinomas (14).
Discovery of aberrant ErbB receptor activation in human cancers
has led to selective therapeutic targeting particularly of epidermal
growth factor receptor (EGFR) and p185her2/neu (ErbB2) with
monoclonal antibodies and small compound tyrosine kinase
inhibitors (TKI; ref. 7). However, recent studies examining the
mechanisms for TKI resistance have highlighted the importance of
kinase-inactive ErbB3 expression, and associated activation of the
phosphatidyl-3-OH kinase (PI3K)/Akt survival pathway (15, 16).
Here, we show ErbB3 receptor expression in a subset of human
prolactinomas and report the functional role of p185c-neu/
ErbB3 signaling in experimental rat lacto-somatotroph hormone
regulation.

Materials and Methods
Materials. Ham’s F10 media, fetal bovine serum, penicillin, streptomycin,
and amphotericin B were purchased from Invitrogen. Epidermal growth
factor (EGF) was from Sigma, and heregulin (NRG1-h1/HRG1-h1) was from
R&D Systems. Gefitinib (Iressa) was purchased from Biaffin GmbH & Co.,
U0126 from Promega, and LY294002 from Calbiochem.
Cell cultures. GH4C1 rat lacto-somatotroph cells were purchased from
the American Type Culture Collection. After synchronization by serum
starvation (medium containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin for f24 h),
cells were plated in 100-mm dishes (f1.5  106 cell density), six-well plates
(f0.5  106 cell density), or 24-well plates (f50,000 cell density) and
treatment agents added with fresh serum-depleted medium (with 0.2%
bovine serum albumin) and samples collected as indicated.
Pituitary glands obtained from female Wistar-Furth rats (140–160 g body
weight) were dissociated to single-cell suspensions by enzymatic degradation of the extracellular adhesion proteins with the Neural Tissue
Dissociation Kit (papain) according to the manufacturer’s instructions

were incubated in complete medium (DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine
serum and antibiotics) for 24 h and then in serum-free medium (0.3%
bovine serum albumin) for 8 h, followed by treatment with heregulin for the
indicated times. At the end of each experiment, supernatants were collected
for growth hormone (GH) and PRL assays, and cells were dissolved in
TRIZOL reagent (Invitrogen) and stored at 80jC.
Short interfering RNA transfections. GH4C1 cells grown in six-well
plates to f50% confluency were serum-starved overnight and transfected
with 100 pmol of Silencer Select Negative Control no. 1 (Scr) short
interfering RNA (siRNA), Silencer Select Predesigned rat mitogen-activated
protein kinase-1 (MAPK1) siRNA (ID: s138100), ErbB2 (Neu) siRNA
(ID: s127710), ErbB3 siRNA (ID: s131557; Applied Biosystems/Ambion) or
both ErbB2 (Neu) and ErbB3 siRNA (50 pmol each) for 24 h using
Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. After an additional 8 h of incubation (serum-free medium),
treatments were added and samples collected at the indicated times.
Templates for probes and Northern blot analysis. RNA extraction was
performed using TRIZOL reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The h-actin probe was a 1.076 kb fragment of the mouse
h-actin gene (Ambion). Probes for rat GH and PRL were generated and
Northern blot analysis performed as previously described (14).
Immunoprecipitation and Western blotting. After completion of
treatments, cells were placed on ice and washed with cold PBS. For whole
cell protein extraction, cells were lysed in 150 AL of radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (Sigma), and for immunoprecipitation experiments, cells
were lysed in 850 AL of modified radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer
[1% Triton X-100, 1% deoxycholate, 0.1% NaDodSO4, 0.15 mol/L NaCl,
0.01 mol/L sodium phosphate (pH 7.4), 2 mmol/L EDTA, 10 mmol/L sodium
pyrophosphate, and 400 Amol/L sodium orthovanadate], containing
complete protease inhibitor cocktail tablets (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail 2 (Sigma). Lysates were
centrifuged at 13,000  g for 20 min at 4jC and protein concentrations
determined by Bradford’s method (Bio-Rad). Approximately 1 mg of protein
was immunoprecipitated with rabbit polyclonal anti-EGFR (1005), antiErbB3 (C-17; 2 Ag; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and with monoclonal
antibody 7.16.4 (ref. 17; 3 Ag; a kind gift from Dr. M.I. Greene, University of
Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA) which reacts specifically with rat p185
molecules. Preclearing was performed with A/G PLUS-Agarose beads
(20 AL; Sigma) overnight at 4jC. Immunoprecipitation with appropriate
antibody titers was performed for 1 h prior to the addition of A/G PLUSAgarose beads (20 AL) overnight at 4jC. Immunoprecipitates were washed
once in lysis buffer and five times in washing buffer and resuspended in SDS
sample buffer (pH 6.8) as previously described (18).
Western blot analysis was performed according to the guidelines of
NuPAGE electrophoresis system protocol (Invitrogen). In brief, whole cell
lysates (f50 Ag protein per lane) or immunoprecipitation samples were
heated for 5 min at 100jC, respectively. Proteins were separated on NuPAGE
4% to 12% Bis-Tris gels and electrotransferred for 1 h to polyvinylidene
difluoride (Invitrogen). Membranes were blocked for 1 h in 2% nonfat dry
milk (or 5% bovine serum albumin) in TBS-T buffer, and incubated
overnight with primary antibody. The following primary antibodies were
used: mouse anti-pERK1/2, rabbit anti-ERK1/2 (1:400; Santa Cruz
Biotechnology), mouse monoclonal anti-pTyr (PY99), rabbit polyclonal
anti-EGFR (1005), anti-Neu (C-18), anti-ErbB3 (C-17, 1:200; Santa Cruz
Biotechnology), rabbit monoclonal anti-pAkt (phosphorylated S473, 1:1,000;
Abcam), rabbit polyclonal anti-Akt, and anti-GAPDH (1:1,000; Cell
Signaling). After washing with TBS-T, membranes were incubated with
peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody for 1.5 h (2% nonfat dry milk or
5% bovine serum albumin in TBS-T buffer). Blots were washed and
hybridization signals measured by enhanced chemiluminescence detection
system (Amersham).
Immunofluorescence. Tumor specimens were fixed in 10% formalin
and embedded in paraffin. After deparaffinization of the sections, antigen
retrieval was performed using citrate and permeabilization by 0.1% Triton
X. Slides were blocked in 10% goat serum in 1% bovine serum albumin-PBS
and then incubated with primary antibody overnight at 4jC. The following
antibodies were used: rabbit polyclonal anti-Neu (C-18) and anti-ErbB3

(C-17; 1:100; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Following washes, slides were
incubated with Alexa Fluor goat anti-rabbit 488 (H+L) secondary antibody
(1:500; Invitrogen) for 2 h at room temperature. Nuclei were stained using
1:500 Topro-3 iodide 1 mmol/L solution (1:250 in PBS; Molecular Probes,
Inc.) for 2 h at room temperature, and following such, slides were mounted
with Prolong Gold antifade reagent (Invitrogen). Confocal microscope
images were obtained using a TCS-SP confocal scanner (Leica Microsystems). To detect the contributions of autofluorescence in these paraffinembedded tissues, a spectral imaging approach was used. The confocal
spectrophotometer was set to detect specific FITC fluorescence ranging
from 505 to 540 nm. A second channel detecting autofluorescence with
wavelengths from 560 to 600 nm was used, and both channels color-coded
and merged. Green represents specific fluorescence from FITC and red,
autofluorescence. The staining was strong and autofluorescence was very low
in comparison to the specific signal. Only erythrocytes showed appreciable
autofluorescence and appear dark orange in the images. A Leica PlanApo 20
0.7 numerical aperture lens was used for overview images and a PlanApo 40
1.2 numerical aperture lens was used for high-magnification images.
Quantitative real-time PCR. Total RNA was extracted with Trizol
Reagent (Invitrogen) according to the instructions of the manufacturer.
Total RNA was reverse-transcribed into first-strand cDNA using Moloney
murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) according to the
manufacturer’s protocol. Quantitative PCR reactions were carried out in the
iQ5 Multicolor Real-time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc.)
as follows: 95jC for 3 min, 1 cycle; 95jC for 15 s, 58jC for 1 min, 40 cycles.
Melting curve analysis was performed to ensure product specificity.
Certified RT 2 qPCR Primer Assays for human ErbB2 and ErbB3
were purchased from SuperArray. Human housekeeping gene primer set
(10 genes) was from Real-time Primers. This set included primers for
h-glucuronidase (GUSB), h-actin (ACTB), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
dehydrogenase (GAPDH), transferring receptor (TFRC), phosphor-glycerate
kinase 1 (PGK1 ), hypoxanthin phosphoribosyl-transferase (HPRT1 ),
peptidyl-propyl-isomerase A (PP1A), ribosomal protein L13A (RPL13A),
TATA box-binding protein (TBP), and h2-microglobulin (B2M).
Hormone assays. RIA for rat GH and PRL were performed using
reagents provided by the National Hormone and Peptide Program, National
Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (Harbor-UCLA
Medical Center, Torrance, CA) as described (14).
Statistical analysis. Cell cycle phases were analyzed by ModFit LT
software (version 2.0, Becton Dickinson). NIH Image 1.59 software was used
for densitometric analysis of specific bands in blots and comparisons
evaluated using two-tailed Student’s t test. Results are expressed as mean F
SE of independently performed experiments. Statistical significance was set
at P < 0.05.

Results
ErbB family receptor expression and activation in rat
pituitary GH4C1 cells. The functional role of pituitary prolactinoma ErbB3 expression was examined in rat lacto-somatotroph
GH4C1 cells. Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting with
receptor-specific antibodies showed the expression of EGFR
(175 kDa), p185c-neu (185 kDa), and ErbB3 (185 kDa) in GH4C1 cells.
The EGFR ligand, EGF (5 nmol/L), induced EGFR and p185c-neu
tyrosine phosphorylation, but did not result in ErbB3 phosphorylation. In contrast, heregulin (6 nmol/L), the ErbB3 and ErbB4
ligand, induced tyrosine phosphorylation of ErbB3 and p185c-neu but
not that of EGFR (Fig. 1A). Thus, ErbB1–3 receptors seem to be
functional in GH4C1 cells, and p185c-neu likely heterodimerizes with
both activated EGFR and ErbB3.
Increasing heregulin concentrations selectively induced PRL
mRNA expression up to f5-fold at 48 hours (P < 0.05), with no
observed effect on GH mRNA expression (Fig. 1B). Dose-dependent
heregulin-mediated induction of PRL secretion was also confirmed
in the cell culture medium (Fig. 1C). Heregulin increased PRL

secretion. Heregulin did not induce GH4C1 cell proliferation, as
assessed by cell cycle analysis and cell proliferation assays (data
not shown). Heregulin did not induce PRL in nontumorous mixed
primary rat pituitary cell cultures derived from female WistarFurth rats (data not shown).
Heregulin-mediated p185c-neu/ErbB3 signaling. In time
course experiments (Fig. 2A), treatment of GH4C1 cells with
heregulin (6 nmol/L) induced rapid (within 5 min) ErbB3 tyrosine
phosphorylation. High levels of receptor phosphorylation were
observed for up to 60 minutes, and gradually declined thereafter.
Heregulin also induced marked p185c-neu tyrosine phosphorylation
for up to 30 minutes. Similar to the patterns of immunoprecipitated receptor activation, heregulin induced ERK and Akt
phosphorylation in whole cell extracts as detected by Western
blot. Although ERK activation occurred both in response to EGFR
(with EGF; Fig. 2B) and ErbB3 (with heregulin; Fig. 2A), induction of
Akt signaling was specific for p185c-neu/ErbB3 signaling. Formation
of heregulin-mediated p185c-neu/ErbB3 heterodimers was confirmed by immunoprecipitation (Fig. 2C).

www.aacrjournals.org

As gefitinib blocks heregulin signaling by inducing the formation
of inactive heterodimers between ErbB3 and other ErbB receptor
members (19, 20), we examined the effects of TKI on heregulininduced ErbB receptor activation and downstream signaling. As
shown in Fig. 3A, pretreatment with increasing gefitinib concentrations suppressed both receptor activation and signaling.
Interestingly, inhibition of heregulin-induced ERK and Akt
phosphorylation was observed at the lowest concentration tested
(0.1 Amol/L), whereas suppression of p185c-neu and ErbB3 tyrosine
phosphorylation was observed with higher gefitinib doses (0.5 and
5 Amol/L). Gefitinib also dose-dependently prevented heregulininduced p185c-neu/ErbB3 heterodimerization (Fig. 3B) and PRL
secretion (Fig. 3C).
Functional role of pituitary p185c-neu/ErbB3 heterodimer
signaling. To further explore the mechanisms for the observed
heregulin-mediated effects through p185c-neu and ErbB3 receptor
activation, we used siRNA to selectively down-regulate these
respective ErbB receptor members. Under these experimental
conditions, we observed up to 60% reduction of p185c-neu and
ErbB3 expression, which was associated with decreased total

down-regulated p185c-neu and or ErbB3 levels, heregulin-induced
PRL mRNA (Fig. 4B) and PRL hormone (Fig. 4C) expression were
attenuated to almost basal levels, whereas no effects on GH were
observed, demonstrating both the specificity of, and requirement
for, both p185c-neu and ErbB3 for heregulin-mediated PRL
induction.

As heregulin induces ErbB receptor–mediated ERK and Akt
signaling (Figs. 2A and 3A) we used a pharmacologic approach to
block ERK or Akt activation, to identify pathways, specifically
mediating heregulin action on the lactotroph. The PI3K inhibitor
LY294002 dose-dependently suppressed heregulin-induced Akt
phosphorylation (Fig. 5Aa), confirming the activity of the inhibitor
used. However, at the same concentrations, LY294002 had no effect

on heregulin-induced PRL mRNA (Fig. 5Ab) and PRL hormone
(Fig. 5Ac) expression. The dose-dependent effects of the MEK
inhibitor U0126 on heregulin-induced ERK phosphorylation are
shown in Fig. 5Ad. In contrast to PI3K/Akt signaling blockade, the
MEK inhibitor dose-dependently suppressed heregulin-induced
PRL mRNA expression (Fig. 5Ae) and PRL secretion (Fig. 5Af ).
The specific involvement of ERK in mediating heregulin-induced
PRL expression was confirmed by siRNA experiments (Fig. 5B).
Suppression of MAPK1 by siRNA attenuated heregulin-induced
(10 minutes) ERK phosphorylation, PRL mRNA, and secreted
hormone levels. These results thus indicate that heregulin-induced
PRL seems to be mediated by ERK signaling.
ErbB2 and ErbB3 expression in human PRL-secreting
pituitary adenomas. Immunofluorescence staining for ErbB2
(p185her2/neu) and ErbB3 was performed in eight human PRLsecreting tumors (Supplementary Table). Human breast carcinoma
tissue samples were used as immunoreactive controls, whereas
antibody-specific blocking peptides (sc-284-P and sc-285-P) suppressed the fluorescent signal, confirming the specificity of the
antibody reactions (Supplementary Figs. S1 and S2).
Two patients (cases 7 and 8) underwent multiple surgeries due
to dopamine agonist resistance; case 8 eventually evolved into a
carcinoma with loss of PRL immunoreactivity. Positive ErbB2
staining with varying intensities was observed in seven of eight
tumor specimens, whereas tumor tissue obtained from four cases
was immunoreactive for ErbB3 (Fig. 6A), and also exhibited a Ki-67
index of z4% (Supplementary Table).
ErbB2 and ErbB3 mRNA expression were compared by
quantitative PCR analysis of two tumor specimens derived from
a patient who initially underwent surgery for an invasive but
histologically benign prolactinoma (specimen obtained in 1997).
Tissue was not available for immunostaining. Progressive resistance to high-dose dopamine agonists necessitated four consecutive trans-sphenoidal pituitary surgeries due to tumor remnant
regrowth. Gamma-knife radiotherapy temporarily stabilized the

tumor mass and PRL levels, however, subsequent tumor enlargement caused loss of unilateral vision. The surgical tumor specimen
obtained in 2008 showed a Ki-67 index of 20%. When we used two
housekeeping genes (GAPDH and TFRC) for internal normalization, ErbB2 and ErbB3 mRNA expression levels were observed to be
elevated f5 and 41-fold, respectively, in the 2008 specimen
(Fig. 6Ba). When 10 housekeeping genes (most of which also
exhibited up-regulation) were evaluated in the assay, ErbB2 and
ErbB3 expression levels were shown to be increased f 1 and
11-fold, respectively (Fig. 6Bb).

Discussion
Pituitary adenomas account for f15% of primary intracranial
neoplasms and are discovered in up to 25% of unselected autopsy
specimens (2). PRL-secreting adenomas account for f40% of all
pituitary tumors (1). Indications for prolactinoma therapy include
hyperprolactinemia-associated hypogonadism, infertility, and osteoporosis, as well as central compressive effects (1, 21). Drug
intolerance or the development of dopamine agonist resistance may
constrain medical therapy of benign prolactinomas (3). Effective
drug therapies are also required for recurrent invasive macroprolactinomas or those that undergo rare malignant transformation
and are resistant to attempts at surgery and radiation (4–6).
We show here that human prolactinomas express ErbB3
receptors, and that heregulin, an ErbB3 ligand, induces PRL gene
expression. Expression of other ErbB receptor family members
EGFR (22–27) and p185her2/neu (11, 13, 25) have been reported
in the normal anterior pituitary. EGFR (9, 10, 13, 25–27) and
p185her2/neu (11, 25, 28, 29) expression in pituitary adenomas have
been associated with more invasive tumor phenotypes (9–13),
suggesting a role for these receptors in aggressive tumor behavior.
Estrogen-mediated rat lactotroph hyperplasia is also associated
with the up-regulation of pituitary transforming growth factor-a,
an EGFR ligand (30), and lactotroph transforming growth factor-a

overexpression in transgenic mice results in hyperplasia and
pituitary adenoma formation (31). EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibition
was shown to inhibit EGF-induced rat lactotroph differentiation
and tumor growth (14), indicating a role for EGFR signaling in
prolactinoma regulation.
ErbB3 activation and subsequent PI3K/Akt signaling may
contribute to TKI resistance in breast and lung cancer (15, 16).
p185her2/neu and ErbB3 are functionally incomplete receptors.
The extracellular domain of p185her2/neu seems to be devoid of
ligand-binding activity, whereas ErbB3 contains a nonfunctional
kinase domain devoid of catalytic kinase activity. However, the
p185her2/neu/ErbB3 heterodimer is the most active signaling dimer
in the ErbB family (8). Ligand induction leads to ErbB3 transphosphorylation (32), the only ErbB receptor which couples directly to
PI3K/Akt (33). Although pituitary heregulin (glial growth factor)
expression has been reported (34), ErbB3 expression and the role
of p185her2/neu/ErbB3 signaling in pituitary tumorigenesis were not
heretofore known.
Rat lacto-somatotroph GH4C1 cells are shown here to express
functional ErbB receptor members (Fig. 1A), and p185c-neu tyrosine
phosphorylation was observed in response to both EGFR and ErbB3
activation, suggesting p185c-neu as the preferred dimerization partner
in these cells. p185c-neu tyrosine phosphorylation was detected only in
response to ligand induction, suggesting the expression of nonmutated proto-oncogenic p185c-neu, similar to the observed absence
of p185her2/neu activating mutations in human pituitary adenomas

(28). Heregulin induction of PRL (Fig. 1B and C), suggests a functional
role for p185c-neu/ErbB3 signaling in PRL but not GH control,
consistent with known GH regulation (35). In contrast to EGFR
and p185her2/neu (11, 13, 22–27), nontumorous pituitary lactotrophs
likely do not express ErbB3, as we did not observe PRL regulation by
heregulin in primary rat pituitary cell cultures. ErbB receptormediated PRL regulation may be selective for transformed lactotrophs with altered intracellular signaling and loss of dopaminergic
control. Indeed, GH3/GH4C1 cells do not express functional D2
dopamine receptors (36) and are resistant to dopamine agonists,
similar to drug-resistant aggressive prolactinomas.
Aberrant Akt (37) and MAPK (38) activity in human pituitary
tumors, and heregulin-mediated ErbB3 and p185c-neu tyrosine
phosphorylation and receptor heterodimerization we observed,
was associated with ERK and Akt activation. EGF, the EGFR ligand,
also activated ERK but not PI3K/Akt signaling, as previously shown
for GH3 cells (14), demonstrating the requirement of pituitary
ErbB3 activation for PI3K/Akt signaling induction. As targeted
ErbB3-specific therapies are not currently available, we used
pharmacologic inhibition of the receptor with gefitinib, an EGFR
TKI, which induces the formation of inactive heterodimers between
ErbB3 and other ErbB receptor members, thereby blocking
heregulin signaling (19, 20). Indeed, gefitinib treatment suppressed
ErbB3 and p185c-neu tyrosine phosphorylation and downstream
signaling. Dose-dependent differences of gefitinib inhibition on
receptor (higher doses) versus ERK and Akt activation (lower

p185c-neu/ErbB3-Mediated PRL Regulation

doses) are likely due to differences in assay sensitivities, as the blots
for immunoprecipitated ErbB3 and p185c-neu show total tyrosine
phosphorylation load, and are not reflective of specific tyrosine
residues which signal for ERK and Akt. Although low doses of
gefitinib could inhibit transactivated EGFR on ERK signaling by
heregulin, the ligand did not seem to induce EGFR transactivation
(Fig. 1A).
Individual p185c-neu and ErbB3 down-regulation suppressed
heregulin effects, indicating the requirement of functional pituitary
p185c-neu/ErbB3 signaling for heregulin action on PRL. In the
presence of heregulin, specific pharmacologic and siRNA-mediated
inhibition of ERK, but not Akt signaling, mediated PRL regulation,
consistent with known Ras/Raf/MAPK/Ets-1–mediated PRL regulation in GH3/GH4 cells (39, 40). However, downstream involvement
of additional Ras/MAPK-independent mechanisms (as has been
shown for EGF-mediated PRL regulation; refs. 41, 42) cannot be
excluded. In contrast to PRL-releasing peptide and insulin, however,
which signal to the proximal rat PRL promoter in a pathway that
involves PI3K/Akt (43), p185c-neu/ErbB3–mediated PI3K/Akt activation does not seem to induce lactotroph differentiation but could
reflect changes leading to a more aggressive cell phenotype.
The unavailability of functional human pituitary cell lines and
scarcity of surgically obtained human prolactinoma specimens

renders mechanistic analysis of heregulin signaling in human prolactinomas an experimental challenge. We examined p185her2/neu
and ErbB3 expression in seven benign prolactinomas and one
carcinoma (Hardy class 4) by immunofluorescence and showed
p185her2/neu expression in the majority of tumors (seven of eight). In
addition, we now also show ErbB3 expression in a subset of these
tumors ( four of eight), a novel finding which may indicate altered
patterns of tumor differentiation. Tumors which were immunoreactive for ErbB3 expressed relatively high levels of Ki-67, a marker
of increased pituitary cell proliferation (44). ErbB3 immunoreactivity was also detected in an aggressive carcinoma specimen.
Quantitative PCR analysis of available RNA samples derived from a
single individual who initially presented with a benign prolactinoma, which recurred as a malignant prolactinoma with dopamine
resistance and failed surgery and radiation, revealed dramatic upregulation of ErbB3 mRNA expression in the second tumor sample.
In addition to the potential efficacy of temozolomide therapy
(45, 46), and the development of new generation PRL receptor
antagonists (47), these results highlight the importance of
examining ErbB receptor expression in surgical prolactinoma
specimens. Benign prolactinomas usually respond effectively to
medical therapy with dopamine agonists, and drug resistance may
be an early sign of aggressive tumor behavior. In very rare cases of
