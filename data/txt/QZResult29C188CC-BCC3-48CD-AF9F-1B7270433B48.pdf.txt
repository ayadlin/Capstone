Abstract

Author Manuscript

Replication fork stalling can promote genomic instability, predisposing to cancer and other
diseases1–3. Stalled replication forks may be processed by sister chromatid recombination (SCR),
generating error-free or error-prone homologous recombination (HR) outcomes4–8. In mammalian
cells, a long-standing hypothesis proposes that the major hereditary breast/ovarian cancer
predisposition gene products, BRCA1 and BRCA2, control HR/SCR at stalled replication forks9.
Although BRCA1 and BRCA2 affect replication fork processing10–12, direct evidence that BRCA
genes regulate HR at stalled chromosomal replication forks is lacking due to a dearth of tools for
studying this process. We report that the Escherichia coli Tus/Ter complex13–16 can be engineered
to induce site-specific replication fork stalling and chromosomal HR/SCR in mammalian cells.
Tus/Ter-induced HR entails processing of bidirectionally arrested forks. We find that the BRCA1
C-terminal tandem BRCT repeat and regions of BRCA1 encoded by exon 11—two BRCA1
elements implicated in tumor suppression—control Tus/Ter-induced HR. Inactivation of either
BRCA1 or BRCA2 increases the absolute frequency of “long-tract” gene conversions at Tus/Terstalled forks—an outcome not observed in response to a restriction endonuclease-mediated
chromosomal double strand break (DSB). Therefore, HR at stalled forks is regulated differently
from HR at DSBs arising independently of a fork. We propose that aberrant long-tract HR at
stalled replication forks contributes to genomic instability and breast/ovarian cancer predisposition
in BRCA mutant cells.

Tus binds the 23-bp Ter site to induce polar replication fork arrest in E. coli13–16. To
determine whether Tus/Ter can arrest mammalian replisomes, we introduced six TerB sites
into a plasmid containing the Epstein Barr Nuclear Antigen 1 (EBNA1)-binding origin of
replication (“p6xTerOri”, Fig. 1a). EBNA1 recruits mammalian replication factors,
mediating predominantly unidirectional plasmid replication, due to a replication block at
EBNA1-bound “FR” repeats17. In p6xTerOri, the major clockwise fork approaches the
“non-permissive” (fork-stalling) face of Tus/Ter (Fig. 1a). We used two-dimensional DNA
gel electrophoresis (2DGE) with Southern blotting to visualize replication through 6xTer.
Transfection of 293E cells, which express EBNA118, with p6xTerOri and control empty
vector revealed plasmid replication intermediates (arc “A”, Fig. 1b). Co-transfection of
p6xTerOri and wild-type (wt) myc-tagged Tus revealed site-specific stalling of the
clockwise fork (spot “B”, Fig. 1b, 1c; Extended Data Fig. 1). TusH144A, a Ter bindingimpaired mutant16, induced minimal fork stalling. 6xTer in the “permissive” orientation
(“6xREVTer”, Fig 1b) also mediated Tus-dependent stalling of the clockwise fork, albeit
less efficiently than non-permissive 6xTer (Fig. 1b and 1c). The FR/EBNA1 replication
block is incomplete19. A weaker Tus/Ter-dependent double-Y spot (“C”, Fig. 1b), reflects
bidirectional fork arrest at 6xTer. (We estimate the FR/EBNA1 and Tus/6xTer replication
block efficiencies as ~70%; Extended Data Fig. 2). Thus, Tus/Ter mediates bidirectional
site-specific arrest of mammalian replication forks.

Author Manuscript

To determine whether Tus/Ter induces HR/SCR at a defined chromosomal locus in
mammalian cells, we placed 6xTer in an HR reporter of short- and long-tract gene
conversion (STGC and LTGC) between sister chromatids20. Duplication of a red fluorescent
protein (RFP) cassette distinguishes LTGC (length ≥1252 bp; GFP+RFP+) from STGC
(length <1252 bp; GFP+RFP−; Fig. 2a)20. 6xTer abuts an I-SceI restriction site, interrupting
an enhanced green fluorescent protein gene (“6xTer-I-SceI-GFP”, Fig. 2a). Recombination
of the stalled left-hand fork (Fig. 2a) with the 5′-truncated GFP copy (“Tr-GFP”) of the
sister chromatid generates wtGFP. If chromosomal fork arrest were bidirectional, this could
produce a two-ended break, generating predominantly STGCs (Fig. 2a, Extended Data Fig.
3a)20. In contrast, unidirectional fork arrest with one-ended breaks would favor LTGC, and
any STGCs arising from one-ended breaks would necessarily be terminated by noncanonical mechanisms (Extended Data Fig. 3b)20.

Author Manuscript

We targeted the 6xTer/HR reporter as a single copy to the ROSA26 locus of mouse
embryonic stem (ES) cell line 11CO/47T (“Brca1fl/BRCT”)20. Brca1BRCT encodes a Cterminal truncated protein; the BRCT-encoding elements of Brca1fl can be conditionally
deleted (generating “Brca1Δ”)20. Indeed, wtTus, but not TusH144A, induced HR within
6xTer/HR Brca1fl/BRCT cells, the major HR product being STGC (Fig. 2b). wtTus failed to
induce HR in Brca1fl/BRCT cells containing a ROSA26-targeted HR reporter lacking the Ter
array (Fig. 2b)20. Thus, Tus/Ter-induced chromosomal HR requires cognate Tus-Ter
binding. The ratio LTGC/Total HR, a measure of the probability that HR resolves as LTGC,
was ~7% in three independent Tus-transfected clones (Fig. 2c; Extended Data Fig. 4a).
Three additional independent clones of Brca1fl/BRCT ES cells, each containing a single-copy
randomly integrated chromosomal 6xTer/HR reporter, behaved similarly (Extended Data
Fig. 4b). The predominance of STGC and the consistent results at different loci suggested

that Tus/Ter-induced HR entails bidirectional fork arrest (Extended Data Fig. 3a). We
resolved this definitively by Southern blot analysis of Tus/Ter-induced STGCs.
Unidirectional fork arrest/breakage (Extended Data Fig. 3b) could produce a one-ended
break, generating STGC products of variable size20. In contrast, bidirectional fork arrest
(Fig. 2a, Extended Data Fig. 3a) could produce a two-ended break, with STGC termination
by annealing. This would generate STGC products of fixed size, resembling the parental
reporter but lacking the 6xTer array or I-SceI site (Fig 2a)20. Indeed, 44/44 Tus/Ter-induced
STGCs in 6xTer/HR reporter Brca1fl/BRCT cells revealed this latter structure (Fig. 2d). As
expected, I-SceI-induced HR behaved similarly (Fig. 2d). A second arrested fork (right-hand
fork, Fig. 2a) must provide the homologous second end during Tus/Ter-induced STGC.
Therefore, Tus/Ter-induced STGC is the product of bidirectional replication fork arrest.
Overall I-SceI-induced HR in Brca1fl/BRCT 6xTer/HR reporter cells was ~20% of that in
isogenic ROSA26-targeted Brca1fl/BRCT HR reporter cells, which differ only by the lack of a
6xTer array (data not shown)20. The reasons for this difference are unclear.

To investigate further the non-polar behavior of Tus/Ter in mammalian HR, we studied the
Tus mutant F140A that binds duplex Ter with higher affinity than wtTus but is defective for
the Ter C-6 base-flipping “locking” mechanism that contributes to polar fork arrest in E.
coli16. TusF140A induced higher levels of HR than wtTus in 6xTer/HR Brca1fl/BRCT cells
(Extended Data Fig. 4c and 4d), showing that the C-6 “lock” is dispensable for Tus/Terinduced HR in mammalian cells. This might be explained by the different polarities of the E.
coli DnaB and vertebrate MCM replicative helicases. Ter C-6 is located on the leading
strand of the fork approaching the non-permissive end of Ter. Unlike DnaB, which
translocates along the lagging strand, the MCM helicase translocates along the leading
strand and might occlude Ter C-6 within its barrel, thereby denying Tus access to the C-6
lock mechanism. To determine the minimal number of Tus/Ter complexes needed for HR
induction, we generated reporters containing 3, 2 or 1 Ter sites (Extended Data Fig. 4e). We
targeted each, in parallel, as a single copy to the ROSA26 locus of Brca1fl/BRCT ES cells and
found that a minimum of 3 Ter sites is required for robust Tus-induced HR (Extended Data
Fig. 4f). We inverted the 6xTer array orientation to generate a “6xREVTer/HR” reporter.
When targeted as a single copy to the ROSA26 locus of Brca1fl/BRCT ES cells, this reporter
supported Tus-induced HR as robustly as the 6xTer/HR reporter (Extended Data Fig. 4f).
Our findings do not exclude a polar component to Tus/Ter-induced fork stalling on a
mammalian chromosome but this polarity, if present, is relative not absolute.

Interstrand DNA cross-link repair of plasmids replicating in Xenopus laevis egg extracts
entails endonucleolytic attack of bidirectionally stalled forks21. Interestingly, Tus/Terinduced HR was suppressed by depletion of the endonuclease scaffold Slx4/FancP22,23 to a
greater extent than I-SceI-induced HR (Extended Data Fig. 5), suggesting that Slx4
contributes specifically to Tus/Ter-induced HR. However, it is not clear whether Slx4
mediates endonucleolytic attack of stalled forks during Tus/Ter-induced HR. Work in
Schizosaccharomyces pombe suggests that alternative mechanisms, such as template
switching, could mediate HR at stalled mammalian forks7.
To determine whether BRCA1 regulates HR at stalled replication forks, we transduced
6xTer/HR Brca1fl/BRCT cells with adeno-Cre and screened for wtBrca1 loss (Fig. 3a). The

resulting Brca1Δ/BRCT cells are viable hypomorphs with growth characteristics similar to
Brca1fl/BRCT cells20. We studied Tus-induced HR in three independent Cre-treated clones of
each genotype (Fig. 3). Surprisingly, Tus-induced STGC in 6xTer/HR Brca1Δ/BRCT cells
showed no reduction compared to Brca1fl/BRCT cells, but LTGC was elevated 2-fold (Fig.
3b). Correspondingly, the probability of engaging LTGC during Tus/Ter-induced HR was
doubled to ~15% (Fig. 3b). Consistent with our recent findings, I-SceI-induced HR in
6xTer/HR Brca1Δ/BRCT cells was diminished and biased in favor of LTGC (Fig. 3b)20.
Southern analysis of Tus/Ter-induced STGC and LTGC products in 6xTer/HR Brca1Δ/BRCT
cells revealed patterns similar to Brca1fl/BRCT cells (Extended Data Fig. 6). However, in
Brca1Δ/BRCT cells, 6/41 (15%) Tus/Ter-induced STGC and 3/15 (20%) LTGC clones
retained an additional copy of the parental reporter (Extended Data Fig. 6). This was not
separable by recloning, suggesting that it was retained by nondisjunction. 4/41 (9.8%) ISceI-induced STGC Brca1Δ/BRCT clones revealed nondisjunction; thus, nondisjunction is
not specific to Tus/Ter-induced HR. The fact that the donor sister was unaltered during
LTGC excludes crossing-over as a cause of the LTGC outcome in these clones24,25.

We asked whether Brca1 domains additional to the BRCT repeat regulate Tus/Ter-induced
HR. Indeed, siRNA-mediated Brca1 depletion suppressed STGC but increased LTGC in
both Brca1fl/BRCT and Brca1Δ/BRCT cells (Extended Data Fig. 7). In Brca1-depleted
Brca1Δ/BRCT cells, ~40% of all HR products were LTGCs. More than half of the BRCA1
polypeptide is encoded by exon 11, which is a target of inactivating germ line mutation in
hereditary breast/ovarian cancer; exon 11 is also alternatively spliced, generating an inframe nuclear Δexon11 gene product that retains N-terminal RING domain and C-terminal
BRCT functions26. To test whether Brca1 exon 11 regulates Tus/Ter-induced HR, we
targeted a single copy of the 6xTer/HR reporter to the ROSA26 locus of mouse
Brca1fl/Exon11 ES cells. The Brca1Exon11 allele lacks exon 11; exon 11 of Brca1fl can be
conditionally deleted to generate “Brca1Δ” (Fig. 4a)27. (Note: “fl” and “Δ” denote distinct
Brca1 alleles in the two Brca1 conditional systems described here.) Following adeno-Cre
treatment, we retrieved 6xTer/HR Brca1fl/Exon11 and 6xTer/HR Brca1Δ/Exon11 clones. Each
of three independent 6xTer/HR Brca1Δ/Exon11 clones revealed reduced Tus/Ter-induced
STGC but increased absolute frequencies of LTGC in comparison with three independent
6xTer/HR Brca1fl/Exon11 clones (Fig. 4b). Deletion of Brca1 exon 11 increased the
probability of engaging Tus/Ter-induced LTGC ~4-fold to ~30% (Fig. 4b). In contrast, the
absolute frequency of I-SceI-induced LTGC was reduced in Brca1Δ/Exon11 cells and ~20%
of HR products were LTGCs (Fig 4b). Thus, Brca1 exon 11 contributes to Tus/Ter-induced
HR both quantitatively and qualitatively.

Author Manuscript

To determine whether BRCA2/Rad51 regulates Tus/Ter-induced HR, we used siRNA to
deplete Brca2 or Rad51 during HR induction. Depletion of Brca2 suppressed Tus/Terinduced STGC but elevated LTGC frequencies in both Brca1fl/BRCT and Brca1Δ/BRCT cells
(Extended Data Fig. 8). In Brca1fl/BRCT and Brca1Δ/BRCT cells depleted of Brca2, ~30% and
~50% respectively of all Tus/Ter-induced HR products were LTGCs, while the equivalent
probabilities for Rad51-depleted cells were ~40% and ~70% (Extended Data Fig. 9). Thus,
suppression of LTGC at stalled forks is a shared function of BRCA1, BRCA2 and Rad51.

expected20, but did not affect Tus/Ter-induced HR in either Brca1fl/BRCT or Brca1Δ/BRCT
cells (Extended Data Fig. 10). This suggests that BRCA1’s functions in Tus/Ter-induced
and SceI-induced HR are, in part, distinct. LTGC at stalled forks may include pathological
responses analogous to break-induced replication in yeast3,8,28,29. Our work identifies loss
of BRCA1/BRCA2/Rad51-dependent suppression of LTGC at stalled replication forks as a
potential contributor to breast/ovarian cancer predisposition.

standard error of the mean (SEM) of at least three independent experiments. Tus or I-SceI
expression vector transfection efficiencies were typically between 50% and 75%, and
background levels of HR products typically <0.005% for GFP+RFP− and <0.001% for
GFP+RFP+ (e.g., Extended Data Fig. 2a).
Statistical methods

Author Manuscript

Each figure legend reports the sample size in terms of number of replicates per experiment
and number of experiments that were analyzed to generate the data shown. For statistical
analysis of HR values, the arithmetic mean of triplicate samples was calculated for each
independent experiment (i.e., experiments performed on different days) and these single data
points for each experiment were used to calculate the mean and standard deviation between
experiments. The standard error of the mean (s.e.m.) was calculated as standard deviation/
√n, where n= number of experiments (not number of replicates). For example, if we
measured triplicate samples in four different independent experiments, then n=4.
Differences between groups were analyzed by Student’s two-tailed unpaired t-test, assuming
unknown variance, using GraphPad Prism v5.0d software. P-values are given in the figure
legends. Densitometry of 2D gel data was also analyzed by calculation of arithmetic mean
and s.e.m. and analysis by t-test. Analysis of trend in Extended Data Fig. 4f was performed
by ANOVA using GraphPad Prism v5.0d software, in addition to the t-test as described
above.

one experiment (see Source Data 2). Note: replication fork size and position of stall spot B
in relation to replication arc A varies with restriction digest. For example, spot B in KpnIMluI is close to the 2n linear position, since the Tus/Ter-stall site is only ~680 bp from the
KpnI site. For the same reason, spots B and C are closely placed in the KpnI-MluI-digested

Note: the relatively weak spot C in the KpnI-MluI digest, which is consistent across multiple
experiments, might reflect a proportionately large contribution of ssDNA (reflecting
processed lagging strand DNA21) to the ~680 bp lagging strand of the stalled
counterclockwise fork.

abundance of the single stall spot B and the double Y stall spot C can be used to calculate
the efficiency of the FR/EBNA1 replication fork barrier. b, Phosphorimager analysis of
twelve independent Southern blot experiments (method described in Fig. 1b, see Source
Data 3). Note: some images shown in Source Data 3 were also used in other figures. Areas
B, B′, C and C’ are the same shape and size within individual panels. Size and shape of each
area varies between panels. B: stall spot B. B′: background gel signal of same area as B. C:
stall spot C. C’: background gel signal of same area as C. Relative intensity of spot B/B+C
estimates the stalling efficiency at FR/EBNA1 and is calculated as:

The stalling efficiency at FR/EBNA1 is therefore 70% ± 2.2% (s.e.m.).
Relative intensity of spot C is calculated as:

c, Structure of p6xTer-2Ori plasmid. Stalled replication intermediates depict different
combinations of FR/EBNA1 block/bypass and Tus/6xTer block/bypass. Spots B and B2 are
defined as in the diagram. Spots C and C2 result from FR/EBNA1 bypass. Spot C2 requires
successful arrest at both of the 6xTer arrays. Spot C results from bypass of one of the two
6xTer arrays. d, One of three independent experiments performed with p6xTer-2Ori.
Methods as in Fig. 1b. Note presence of four stall spots in p6xTer-2Ori replicating in
presence of wtTus. Double Y stall spots C and C2 and background signal C′ were
quantified. Note: shape and size of each area is identical within an individual experiment,
but varies between experiments (see Source Data 3). By considering only double Y stall
spots (i.e., in which FR/EBNA1 bypass has occurred), the relative abundance of the double
Y stall spots C and C2 are used to estimate the efficiency of the Tus/6xTer replication fork
barrier. Let a = probability of the 6xTer array blocking the fork and b = probability of 6xTer
bypass. Then:

Author Manuscript

The probability of the two 6xTer arrays blocking each fork on one p6xTer-2Ori plasmid
(generating spot C2) is a2.
The probability of one 6xTer array being blocked and the second array being bypassed
(generating spot C) is 2ab.
Relative densitometry of spots C and C2 (each with subtraction of background C′—Source
Data 3) shows that spot C contributes 49.6% and C2 contributes 50.4% (s.e.m. 5.6%).
Therefore:

Author Manuscript

Therefore, the estimated efficiency of the Tus/6xTer replication fork block within the
replicating plasmid is 67%. Note: the efficiency of the Tus/6xTer replication fork block
within the chromosome is unknown.

a, Bidirectional fork arrest would provide two DNA ends for sister chromatid
recombination. Termination by annealing generates STGC products of a fixed size.
Recombining GFP elements and HR reporter features other than Tus/Ter are not shown.
Black strands: parental DNA. Grey strands: newly synthesized DNA. Arrow heads on DNA
strands represent DNA synthesis. Blue/grey hexagons: Tus monomers. Red triangles: Ter
sites. Green line: invading DNA strand. Green dotted line: nascent strand extension. b,
Unidirectional fork arrest would provide only one DNA end for sister chromatid
recombination. Following one-ended invasion of the neighboring sister chromatid, any
STGC products could not be terminated by annealing, since there is no homologous second
end. Termination by non-canonical mechanisms would generate STGCs of unpredictable/
variable size, as in Chandramouly et al20. DNA and protein elements labeled as in panel (a).
Note 1: LTGC is not considered in this analysis, since the mechanisms of termination of the
major LTGC products are not accessible from the current data.
Note 2: Each model invokes a hypothetical DSB intermediate. Tus/Ter-induced HR could be
initiated by a template switching mechanism (i.e., without the formation of an initiating
DSB intermediate). However, the requirement for a homologous second end is not altered by
consideration of a template switch model and this second end must be provided by the
processing of a second arrested fork (the right-hand fork in panel a).
