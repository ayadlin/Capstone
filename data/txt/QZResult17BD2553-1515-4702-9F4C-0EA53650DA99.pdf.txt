ABSTRACT
Previous studies suggested that bisphosphonate zoledronic acid exerts an antitumor effect by interacting with the microenvironment. In this study, we aimed to
elucidate the mechanism behind the anti-breast cancer effect of zoledronic acid.
Here we showed that zoledronic acid did not influence in vitro human breast
cancer cell survival, but did affect human stromal cell survival. Breast cancer cell
death in co-culture with stromal cells was analyzed in vitro by fluorescent microscopy
and flowcytometry analysis. In co-culture, the addition of stromal cells to breast
cancer cells induced tumor cell death by zoledronic acid, which was abolished by
transforming growth factor (TGF)-β. In the in vivo chicken chorioallantoic membrane
model, zoledronic acid reduced the breast cancer cells fraction per tumor only in
the presence of human stromal cells. Zoledronic acid decreased TGF-β excretion
by stromal cells and co-cultures. Moreover, supernatant of zoledronic acid treated
stromal cells reduced phospho-Smad2 protein levels in breast cancer cells. Thus,
zoledronic acid exerts an anti-breast cancer effect via stromal cells, accompanied
by decreased stromal TGF-β excretion and reduced TGF-β signaling in cancer cells.

INTRODUCTION

Bisphosphonates, currently used as supportive
treatment in breast cancer patients with bone metastases,
have a potential anti-cancer effect via microenvironmenal
cells. A recent meta-analysis [4] concluded that this class
of compounds induces survival benefit in postmenopausal
women being treated for breast cancer. Although the
anti-cancer effect of bisphosphonates is apparently not
limited to their anti-resorptive role in bone lesions [5],
the mechanism behind this anti-cancer response remains
unclear. Recent research has elucidated parts of this
mystery by showing that the bisphosphonates risedronate
and pamidronate are internalized by tumor-associated
macrophages, but not by mouse tumor cells 4T1 [6].
The authors concluded that these compounds target
macrophages, but not tumor cells. These results support
an indirect anti-tumor effect of bisphosphonates.
It would be of great benefit for further optimization
when this indirect anti-tumor effect would be further
clarified. For this, optimal preclinical models containing

Breast cancer accounts for the highest cancer
incidence and cancer mortality among women worldwide
[1]. Despite great advances in breast cancer treatment,
including increasingly targeted systemic treatment,
development of metastatic disease still cannot be
prevented in all patients. Therefore, there is a continuous
search for new treatment strategies that may increase the
effect of systemic therapy. Currently, the importance of
the tumor microenvironment in which immune cells,
fibroblasts, adipose cells and endothelial cells are involved
in tumor growth and metastasis has become more evident
[2]. Furthermore, preclinical studies have also shown that
the microenvironment is an important regulator of cancer
cell related drug sensitivity [3]. This provides the rational
for targeting not only the cancer cells, but also the tumor
microenvironment to improve treatment options for breast
cancer patients.

RESULTS

both human cancer cells and human stromal components
are essential [7, 8]. At present optimal preclinical models
are lacking. In vitro culture models are mostly too
simplified and traditional mouse models fall short in this
setting, since mouse stromal infiltration into human cell
line xenografts as well as into patient derived xenografts
occur to a high extent [9, 10].
We have optimized the chorioallantoic membrane
(CAM) model, which makes it possible to study the
direct interactions between human tumor cells and
human stromal cells in vivo in an immune deprived
setting. By using in vitro and in vivo models consisting
of human stromal cells as well as human breast cancer
cells, we studied the role of stromal cells in breast
cancer bisphosphonate sensitivity. Our research provides
functional evidence of the role of stromal cells in
zoledronic acid (ZOL) mediated breast cancer cell death.

Stromal cells are required for the anti-breast
cancer effect of ZOL in vitro
High concentrations of ZOL were required to
decrease cell survival of the human breast cancer cell
lines. The MCF-7 line was not sensitive to ZOL treatment.
The human breast tumor cell lines SCP2, SUM-149, H2N
and MDA-MB-231 had an IC50 of 486, 194, 155 and 86
µM respectively. However, ZOL affected stromal cell
survival at concentrations far below the concentrations
directly affecting breast cancer cell lines: IC50 for human
stromal cell line Hs27a was reached at a concentration of
only 8 µM. In addition, the macrophage cell line RAW
264.7 was also very sensitive to ZOL treatment, with an
IC50 of 19 µM (Figure 1).

± 3.5 %, P < 0.01). This effect was ZOL dose-dependent
in the co-culture group, increasing breast cancer cell death
to 21.6 ± 0.6 % for 100 µM (P < 0.01) and 27.6 ± 7.8 % (P
< 0.001) for 500 µM. In mono-culture, increasing the dose
of ZOL did not increase breast cancer cell death (9.6 ± 1.6
% for 100 µM and 10.3 ± 1.7 % for 500 µM of ZOL). At
48 hours, the stromal-dependent breast cancer cell death
induced by ZOL was even more pronounced than at 24

To investigate the indirect effects of ZOL, we used
a fluorescence-based in vitro co-culture model. In this
model, SCP2 cells were fluorescently labeled before
addition to an Hs27a monolayer, in order to distinguish
tumor cells from stromal cells in cell death assessment.
Representative nuclear structures of a viable and a dead
SCP2 cell are depicted in Figure 2A. At 24 hours (Figure
2B), 50 µM of ZOL increased breast cancer cell death in
the co-culture group (SCP2 and Hs27a) compared to the

hours (Figure 2B). At a ZOL dose of only 10 µM, breast
cancer cell death in the co-culture group (23.5 ± 2.8 %)
was higher compared to the mono-culture group (5.1 ± 3.1
%, P < 0.001). And the effect became more pronounced as
the dose of ZOL increased, with breast cancer cell death of
6.5 ± 2 % for 50 µM, 11.8 ± 2.3 % for 100 µM and 18.4 ±
3.3 % for 500 µM in the mono-culture group versus 37.0 ±
0.4 % for 50 µM, 38.0 ± 3.4 % for 100 µM and 44.0 ± 4.6
% for 500 µM in the co-culture group (P < 0.001 for all
doses). In mono-cultures of SCP2, ZOL increased breast
cancer cell death after 48 hours compared to control from
4.3 ± 1.4 % to 11.8 ± 2.3 % (P < 0.05) for 100 µM and
18.4 ± 3.3 % (P < 0.001) for 500 µM ZOL (Figure 2B).
Breast cancer cells death after ZOL treatment was
also determined by flowcytometry analysis. SCP2 cells

were labeled with DiI and cell death was determined by
LIVE/DEAD stain uptake. In the presence of stromal
cells, SCP2 cell death was induced after treatment with
ZOL. At 24 hours (Figure 2C), 10 µM of ZOL increased
breast cancer cell death in the co-culture group (SCP2 and
Hs27a) compared to the mono-culture (SCP2) group (7.2
± 3.0% vs 2.5 ± 1.1 %, P < 0.05). This effect was ZOL
dose-dependent in the co-culture group, increasing breast
cancer cell death to 11.4 ± 1.4 % for 50 µM (P < 0.001),
11.6 ± 2.9 % for 100 µM (P < 0.001). For 500 µM no
difference was seen in SCP2 cell death with and without
Hs27a cells (39.1 ± 10.5 % vs 26.1 ± 5.1).

Stromal cells are required for anti-breast cancer
cell effect by ZOL in vivo

& eosin (H&E) staining showed no difference in tumor
viability between the tumor groups (Suppl. Figure 2).

Reduced TGF-β signaling in stromal cells is
required for anti-breast cancer effect of ZOL

In the in vivo CAM assay, we investigated the
effect of ZOL in two different breast cancer suptypes; ER
positive (MCF-7) and triple negative (SCP2) breast cancer.
Tumors grown on the CAM assay consisted of tumor cells
only, tumor cells mixed with Hs27a stromal cells or Hs27a
cells only.
On day 14 of the in vivo CAM assay, vehicle-treated
tumors containing SCP2 plus Hs27a cells were heavier
(42.7 ± 14.7 mg vs 21.6 ± 10.3 mg, P < 0.001) and larger
(55.5 ± 21.7 mm3 vs 31.8 ± 15.5 mm3, P < 0.05) compared
to tumors containing only SCP2 cells (Figure 3A and 3B).
Tumors containing only SCP2 cells had a higher weight
after treatment with ZOL compared to vehicle (33.9 ±
17.1 vs 21.6 ± 10.3 mg (P < 0.05). The tumor size was
not affected by ZOL compared to vehicle treatment for
tumors consisting of only SCP2 cells. However, tumors
containing SCP2 plus Hs27a cells were sensitive to ZOL.
On day 14, these tumors weighed less and were smaller
when treated with ZOL compared to vehicle-treated SCP2
plus Hs27a tumors (tumor weight: 23.0 ± 8.6 mg vs 42.7
± 17.7 mg P < 0.01, size: 32.4 ± 19.8 mm3 vs 55.5 ± 21.7
mm3 P < 0.05) (Figure 3A and 3B).
ZOL treatment showed similar results for tumors
consisting of only MCF-7 cells and tumors containing
MCF-7 plus Hs27a cells. On day 14, tumors comprising
MCF-7 plus Hs27a cells were heavier (36.9 ± 8.8 mg vs
21.4 ± 6.2 mg P < 0.01) and larger (54.4 ± 15.5 mm3 vs
18.6 ± 5.6 mm3 P < 0.001) (Figure 3C and 3D) compared
to tumors consisting of only MCF-7 cells. Moreover, ZOL
had no effect on tumors containing only MCF-7 cells.
However, in tumors containing MCF-7 plus Hs27a cells,
ZOL treatment resulted in reduced tumor weight and size
compared to vehicle-treated tumors (weight: 23.5 ± 6.4
mg vs 36.9 ± 8.8 mg P < 0.01, size: 28.2 ± 10.7 vs 54.4
± 15.5 mm3 P < 0.01) (Figure 3C and 3D). ZOL did not
affect size and weight of tumors containing only Hs27a
cells (Suppl. Figure 1).
To verify that the reduction in both size and weight
of tumors consisting of both breast cancer and stromal
cells by ZOL was caused by loss of breast cancer cells,
the breast cancer fraction of all tumors was determined.
The breast cancer fraction accounts for the ratio of breast
cancer cells on the total number of cells, multiplied by
the weight of the tumor. The breast cancer cell fraction
of tumors containing only SCP2 or MCF-7 cells was not
affected by ZOL. However, the breast cancer cell fraction
of SCP2 and MCF-7 tumors that also contained stromal
cells was larger than SCP2 or MCF-7 cells only. ZOL
reduced the breast cancer cell fraction of the co-cultured
tumors (P < 0.01 SCP2, P < 0.05 MCF-7). Moreover, the
size of ZOL-treated SCP2 and MCF-7 co-culture tumors
was reduced compared to the size of their respective
mono-culture tumors (Figure 4A and 4B). Hematoxylin

Total transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1
excretion levels, both active and latent, in supernatant of
stromal cells and co-cultures were reduced by 48 hours
treatment with ZOL (Suppl. Table 1). Total TGF-β1 levels
in supernatant of stromal cells decreased after treatment
with 50, 100 and 500 µM ZOL (Figure 5A). In the
supernatant of SCP2 co-cultured with Hs27a, total TGF-β1
levels also decreased after treatment with ZOL 50 µM,
100 µM and 500 µM (Figure 5B). In co-cultures of H2N
with Hs27a and MCF-7 with Hs27a, total TGF-β1 levels
were reduced after treatment of 100 µM and 500 µM ZOL
(Figure 5C and 5D). However, 48 hours of ZOL treatment
did not reduce total TGF-β1 levels in the supernatant
of SCP2 and H2N breast cancer cells in the absence of
stromal cells. In the supernatant of MCF-7 breast cancer
cells without stromal cells, total TGF-β1 levels were
undetectable ( < 0 ± 60 pg/mL) (data not shown). One day
of ZOL treatment did not alter total TGF-β1 levels in the
supernatant of monocultures of stromal Hs27a cells and
SCP2, H2N and MCF-7 cells. This was also the case for
the total TGF-β1 levels in the supernatant of co-cultures
of stromal and breast cancer cells treated for 24 hours with
ZOL (Suppl. Figure 3).
ZOL treatment resulted in dose-dependent increased
death of SCP2 cells in co-culture with Hs27a cells in vitro
(Figure 6A). The addition of pure active TGF-β1 to the in
vitro co-culture model of SCP2 and Hs27a cells treated
with ZOL almost completely abolished the ZOL-induced
SCP2 cell death. Two days after the addition of pure active
TGF-β1, SCP2 cell death decreased from 24.3 ± 2.9 % to
9.5 ± 2.3 % (P < 0.001) for 10 µM ZOL, 35.6 ± 2.9 % to
13.3 ± 2.5 % (P < 0.001) for 50 µM ZOL, 37.7 ± 2.9 %
to 15.3 ± 3.8 % (P < 0.001) for 100 µM ZOL and 47.8 ±
8.6 % to 32.9 ± 1.9% (P < 0.001) for 500 µM ZOL. The
addition of pure active TGF-β1 to monocultures of SCP2
cells treated with ZOL did not have this effect.
Blocking of all TGF-β present in our culture models
by a pan-TGF-β antibody resulted in SCP2 cell death
only in the presence of Hs27a cells. At 24 hours of TGF-β
antibody treatment, breast cancer cell death in co-culture
with Hs27a was induced compared to untreated cells (10.9
± 3.6% vs 4.06 ± 0.8% P < 0.01) (Figure 6C). In SCP2
mono-cultures, TGF-β antibody treatment did induce
SCP2 cell death compared to untreated SCP2 monocultures.
Active TGF-β signaling activity in SCP2 breast
cancer cells, measured by pSmad2 levels, was increased
after incubation with Hs27a supernatant (Figure 6B). As
a control, an excess of pure active TGF-β1 (5 ng/mL) was

DISCUSSION

added to the SCP2 cells and this also resulted in clear
Smad2 phosphorylation. In contrast, supernatant of Hs27a
cells treated with all dosages of ZOL decreased pSmad2
levels. This indicates that ZOL can indirectly reduce active
TGF-β signaling in breast cancer cells, via an effect on
stromal cells.

Our study provides functional proof that the
bisphosphonate ZOL can exert an anti-breast cancer
effect only in the presence of stromal cells. We
investigated this in various breast cancer subtypes
and two microenvironmental cell lines. These results
complement research by Junankar et al. showing that

the bisphosphonates risedronate and pamidronate target
macrophages in the breast cancer microenvironment
of mouse 4T1 xenografts [6]. In their mouse model,
intravital imaging revealed bisphosphonate uptake in
calcium-rich tumor regions, while no uptake was seen
in non-cancerous mouse mammary glands. Together
with the data by Junankar et al., our study supports the
concept of a microenvironment-mediated anti-tumor effect
of bisphosphonates, and further clarifies the mechanism
behind this effect.
These results suggest that bisphosphonate treatment
not only modulates the bone environment, but also affects

non-bone disease. This is in line with clinical data. A
recent meta-analysis showed that breast cancer recurrence
decreased in early breast cancer patients treated with a
bisphosphonate [4]. The clear interaction of ZOL with
stromal cells in our study supports the broader effect of
bisphosphonates outside of the bone environment. For
future studies it will be of great interest to further study
the anti-breast cancer effect of zoledronic acid exerted via
other microenvironmental cell types. Furthermore, it will
be relevant to evaluate these effects in a tissue specific
context resembling for example the microenvironment of
the primary tumor or a specific metastatic site.

Bisphosphonates inhibit osteoclast activity by
inhibiting protein prenylation [11]. As inhibition of
prenylation play would result in similar effects on breast
cancer cell death, with and without stromal cells, this
mechanism probably is not responsible for breast cancer
cell death in our study. In our co-culture experiments, the
reduced difference between breast cancer cells with an
without stromal addition at the highest zoledronic acid
concentration could be attributed to prenylation effects on
the tumor cells. This is then in accordance with the IC50
levels observed in the MTT assay.
In our co-culture model, treatment with zoledronic
acid led to reduction of total TGF-β levels and active
signaling activity. Moreover, treatment of breast cancer
cells with an anti-TGF-β antibody instead of zoledronic
acid induced breast cancer cell death only in the co-culture
condition. These results indicate that reduced TGF-β
signaling in breast cancer cells, as observed in co-culture
after zoledronic acid treatment, can cause increased cell
death of breast cancer cells. However, our results do not
rule out that, apart from TGF-β, other factors could also be
involved in this tumor-stroma interaction after zoledronic
acid treatment. Moreover, the reason to why breast cancer
cells, in co-culture compared to mono-culture after
zoledronic acid treatment, are more dependent on TGF-β
signaling remains to be elucidated. Previous research
suggested a strong role for the microenvironment with
respect to bisphosphonate sensitivity and TGF-β signaling
[12]. In mice, bisphosphonate pamidronate treatment
applied to established in-bone metastases of the cell
line SCP28 evidently reduced active TGF-β signaling
in these metastases. In that study, however, treatment of
SCP28 tumor cells with pamidronate in vitro – without
the presence of stromal cells – affected neither TGF-β
signaling nor tumor cell death. Our study explains this
apparent paradox by demonstrating the mediating role of
the stromal cells. TGF-β transcriptional activity can also
be inhibited by ER activation [13], thereby linking our
research with pre-clinical and clinical studies showing that
bisphosphonates only exert an anti-tumor effect under low
estradiol concentrations [14, 15]. If, under high estradiol
levels, TGF-β signaling is already repressed, adding
another TGF-β suppressing agent like ZOL would have
no additional anti-cancer effect.
To our knowledge, ours is the first study to evaluate
the effect of ZOL on the breast cancer-stroma interaction
by assessing the separate components. This analysis was
made possible by using the CAM model. Due to its low
immunogenicity, xenografts can be grown on the CAM
model up to day 18 of embryonic development [16].
Moreover, in the CAM model, growth of host stroma into
the human xenograft is limited. In contrast, tumors of
mice inoculated with human cell lines or patient-derived
xenografts consist of around 40% mouse DNA [10, 17].
We observed good experimental reproducibility of the
CAM assay between separate experiments.

In conclusion, the anti-breast cancer effect of ZOL
is dependent on the presence of stromal cells. This is
accompanied by decreased stromal cell TGF-β excretion
and reduced TGF-β signaling in cancer cells.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell lines and reagents
The human cell lines used in this study were
representing different breast cancer subtypes and two
microenvironmental cell lines. ER positive breast cancer
cell line MCF-7 and immortalized stromal cell line
Hs27a (American Type Culture Collection (ATCC))
were cultured in Roswell Park Memorial Institute
(RPMI) medium (Invitrogen), supplemented with 10%
fetal calf serum (FCS). Hs27a cells were cultured up
to a maximum of 30 passages during which these cells
remained phenotypically stable and viable. Macrophage
cell line RAW 264.7 was cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified
Eagle Medium (DMEM) (Invitrogen) with 10% FCS and
1% glutamine. The inflammatory triple negative breast
cancer cell line SUM-149 (Asterand) was cultured in
HAM’s Nutrient Mixture-F12 (HAM) supplemented with
5% FCS, 5 µg/mL insulin and 1 µg/mL hydrocortisone.
Triple negative breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231
(ATCC), the daughter cell line MDA-MB-231-H2N (H2N)
(transfected to stably overexpress HER2) [18], luciferase
transfected MDA-MB-231-SCP2 (SCP2) (provided by Dr
Y Kang, Princeton University, NJ) [19] were cultured in
DMEM with 10% FCS and 1% glutamine. Cell lines were
cultured at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing
5% CO2 and were routinely tested for Mycoplasma.
Short tandem repeat profiling (BaseClear) was used to
authenticate the cell lines.

Breast cancer and stromal cell proliferation in
vitro in response to ZOL
Hs27a, RAW 264.7, MCF-7, MDA-MB-231,
H2N, SCP2 and SUM-149 cells were plated in 96well plates with a density of 2,000 – 12,500 cells/
well. ZOL (SelleckChem) was added in different
concentrations (1-1,000 µM) and cells were incubated
for 96 hours. Thereafter, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2yl)-2,5- diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) was added
and formazan production as read out of cell number and
metabolic activity was measured as described previously
[20].

the eggs. On day 6 of embryonic development, a window
was made in the egg shell to access the CAM. The CAM
was damaged using a cotton tissue (Celltork) and each egg
was inoculated with a total of 5·106 cells in 50 µL culture
media and Matrigel (BD Biosciences) (1:1). On day 10
of embryonic development, a 4 mm latex ring (Dentsply
International) was placed on the CAM and 15 µL of ZOL
(200 µM) or vehicle was pipetted in the ring. The dose
ZOL used in the CAM assay was based on our in vitro
experiments and concurs with a dosage of 16 μg/kg for
an egg weighing on average 0.05 kg. This is a low dose
compared to the clinic, where a patient receives a dose of
4 mg concurring with a dosage of 53 μg/kg for a patient
weighing 75 kg.
Each experiment comprised 3 subgroups; group
1) breast cancer cells only, SCP2 or MCF-7 cells treated
with ZOL (SCP2 n = 15, MCF-7 n = 6) or vehicle (SCP2
n = 17, MCF-7 n = 8), group 2) Hs27a cells treated with
ZOL (n = 8) or vehicle (n = 7) and group 3) a mixture
of breast cancer cells, SCP2 or MCF-7, with Hs27a cells
(1:1) treated with ZOL (SCP2 n = 17, MCF-7 n = 9)
or vehicle (SCP2 n = 12, MCF-7 n = 6). On day 14 of
embryonic development, tumors were harvested, weighed
and measured with a caliper.
Tumor tissue was formalin-fixed and paraffin
embedded for immunohistochemical analyses. H&E
staining was performed to analyze tissue viability and
morphology. Slides (5 µm) were stained with an antibody
against cytokeratin (CK) 8, 18 and 19 (Abcam 1:100).
Substitution of the 1st antibody by bovine serum albumin
was used as negative control. To calculate the breast
cancer cell fraction in the tumors, the ratio of CK positive
cells on the total number of cells was determined per
tumor. Then this number was multiplied by the total tumor
weight.

This fluorescence-based in vitro co-culture model
was described previously [21]. To distinguish the cancer
cells from the stromal cells, SCP2 cells were prelabeled with fluorescent marker DiI (Molecular Probes,
Invitrogen). Hs27a cells were grown as monolayer on
glass slides inserted in 24-well plates. Subsequently,
15,000 SCP2 cells were added per well, with or without
a pre-cultured stromal cell monolayer and allowed to
attach to the glass insert or the stromal layer for 24 hours.
Attached cells were treated with ZOL (10 - 500 µM)
for 24 or 48 hours. To study whether the effects of ZOL
could be counteracted by TGF-β1, a condition with active
TGF-β1 addition was included. The cells were cultured
for 48 hours following the addition of 1 ng/mL pure active
TGF-β1 (PeproTech) concurrently with ZOL.
After incubation, the plates were centrifuged at
300 g for 7 minutes. Glass slides were collected, fixed
with methanol:acetone (1:1) and stained with 1:1000
4’,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). The results
were analyzed by fluorescent microscopy. Tumor cell
viability was assessed with nuclear DAPI staining based
on observation of the nuclear structure (intact versus
fragmented nuclei). For each condition, 6 - 12 fields of
view were counted and the average percentage of dead
cells was calculated.
Breast cancer cell death after ZOL treatment in
presence and absence of stromal cells was determined
by an additional method. Hs27a cells were grown as
monolayer in 6-well plates. SCP2 cells were pre-labeled
with fluorescent marker DiI and plated, with a cell density
of 200,000 cells per well, on plates with or without
pre-cultured stromal layer. Attached cells were treated
with ZOL (10 - 500 µM) or a pan-TGF-ß antibody (10
ng/mL) (R&D systems) for 24 hours. Cell death was
determined by flowcytometry analysis after incubation
with fluorescent LIVE/DEAD stain (Life Technologies)
by manufacturer’s protocol as described before [22]. Cells
positive for DiI and LIVE/DEAD stain were considered
as dead breast cancer cells. Samples were acquired with
FACS LSR II (Becton-Dickinson) and the percentage of
double positive cells (dead breast cancer cells) compared
to DiI positive cells (all breast cancer cells) was quantified
by FlowJo (Tree Star, Inc.).

Stromal and breast cancer TGF-β1 excretion in
mono- and co-culture models in vitro in response
to ZOL
Total TGF-β1 levels were determined in supernatant
of Hs27a cells in mono-culture or in co-culture with MCF7, SCP2 or H2N cells after 24 and 48 hours incubation
with ZOL. Cell culture supernatant was removed,
centrifuged for 15 minutes at 240 g to remove any residual
cells or cell remnants, and subsequently stored frozen
in aliquots. Total TGF-β1 levels were measured with
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) according
to manufacturer’s instructions (Quantikine, R&D
Systems). The absorbance of each well was measured by
a microplate reader (Bio-Rad).

Breast cancer cell death in an in vivo co-culture
model in response to ZOL
To study the effect of ZOL in vivo, the CAM model
was used as described previously [23]. Two breast cancer
models, SCP2 and MCF-7, were studied in this way.
Eggs (het Anker BV) were incubated at 38°C and after
3 days the CAM was lowered by puncturing the top of

Breast cancer TGF-β signaling in vitro in response
to ZOL

1.	

As read out for TGF-β signaling activity, protein
expression of phosphorylated Smad2 was measured
by Western blot. Hs27a cells were grown as monolayer
and treated with ZOL (10 - 500 µM) for 48 hours.
Subsequently, 500,000 SCP2 cells were plated in 6 wells
plates and incubated for 24 hours. Pure active TGF-β1
(5 ng/mL) or harvested supernatant of Hs27a cells was
added to the confluent SCP2 cells. After 1 hour incubation,
the supernatant was removed. Total cell lysates were size
fractionated and transferred to a membrane as described
previously [24].
Membranes were exposed to primary antibodies
(anti-pSmad2; Cell Signaling Technology, anti-β-actin;
MP Biomedicals). Binding of antibodies was determined
using horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary
antibodies (DAKO) and visualized with Lumi-lightplus
(Roche Diagnostics). Band density was evaluated by
ImageJ software.
