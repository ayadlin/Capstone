Abstract
The presence of hypoxia and ﬁbrosis within the primary tumor are two major risk factors for metastasis
of human breast cancer. In this study, we demonstrate that hypoxia-inducible factor 1 activates the
transcription of genes encoding collagen prolyl hydroxylases that are critical for collagen deposition by
breast cancer cells. We show that expression of collagen prolyl hydroxylases promotes cancer cell
alignment along collagen ﬁbers, resulting in enhanced invasion and metastasis to lymph nodes and
lungs. Finally, we establish the prognostic signiﬁcance of collagen prolyl hydroxylase mRNA expression in
human breast cancer biopsies and show that ethyl 3,4-dihydroxybenzoate, a prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor,
decreases tumor ﬁbrosis and metastasis in a mouse model of breast cancer. Cancer Res; 73(11); 3285–96.

Introduction
The majority of human breast cancers develop regions
of severe intratumoral hypoxia (1, 2), leading to the activation of the hypoxia-inducible factors HIF-1 and HIF-2,
which mediate adaptive transcriptional responses to
reduced O2 availability as well as stimulating invasion and
metastasis (3). The HIFs are heterodimeric proteins that
consist of an O 2-regulated HIF-1a or HIF-2a subunit and
a constitutively expressed HIF-1b subunit (3, 4). Genetic
manipulations decreasing HIF-1a expression impede
tumor growth, angiogenesis, and metastasis in animal
models (5–9). Immunohistochemical analyses of primary
breast cancer biopsies have revealed that high HIF-1a
expression is associated with signiﬁcantly increased risks
of treatment failure, disease relapse, distant metastasis,
and patient mortality (10–14). Increased HIF-2a expression
is also associated with increased risk of recurrence and
mortality (15).

Cancer progression is also associated with an increase in
extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition and stiffening, which
enhances cell growth, survival, integrin signaling, and focal
adhesion formation (16–21). Using mouse models that recapitulate the histologic progression of human breast cancer,
mammary tumors exhibited a localized increase in collagen
deposition (22, 23). As tumor size increased, collagen ﬁbers
straightened, bundled, and aligned (24). Several groups
observed tumor cells preferentially invading along aligned
collagen ﬁbers (24–26). However, studies to date have not
determined an underlying molecular mechanism for the
increase in collagen ﬁber formation during tumor progression.
In this study, we tested the hypothesis that HIF-1 is a direct
regulator of increased collagen deposition, which in turn
promotes invasion to drive the metastasis of hypoxic breast
cancer cells.
Collagen biogenesis requires collagen prolyl 4-hydroxylase
(P4H) activity to catalyze collagen proline hydroxylation. Three
isoforms of the P4HA subunit (P4HA1, P4HA2, and P4HA3)
form A2B2 tetramers with P4HB resulting in P4H1, P4H2, and
P4H3 holoenzymes, respectively (27, 28). Proper hydroxylation
is required for folding newly synthesized procollagen polypeptide chains into stable triple helical molecules, a prerequisite
for extracellular secretion (29, 30). Following procollagen
secretion, peptidases remove N- and C-terminal propeptides,
and lysyl oxidase (LOX) cross-links triple-helical molecules to
form mature collagen ﬁbers.
Many studies have focused on the role of LOX family
members in extracellular collagen crosslinking and tumor
progression (9, 18, 31) without considering the rate-limiting
step of collagen deposition. In this study, we determined that
hypoxia-induced collagen prolyl hydroxylase expression promotes collagen deposition, which enhances invasion, leading
to lymph node and lung metastasis. Elevated P4HA1 and
P4HA2 mRNA levels in human breast cancers predict patient

mortality. Finally, we show that treating tumor-bearing mice
with ethyl 3,4-dihydroxybenzoate (DHB), a hydroxylase inhibitor, decreases breast cancer ﬁbrosis and metastasis.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines and culture
MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-435 cells were obtained from
the National Cancer Institute (NCI) PS-OC Network Bioresource Facility and maintained in Dulbecco's Modiﬁed Eagle
Medium with 10% FBS and antibiotics in a 5% CO2, 95% air
incubator (20% O2). The cells tested negative for mycoplasma
using a PCR-based detection kit. The cell lines were authenticated by short tandem repeat proﬁling. Hypoxic cells were
maintained in a modular incubator chamber ﬂushed with a gas
mixture containing 1% O2, 5% CO2, and 94% N2.
shRNA, lentiviruses, and transduction
Vectors encoding short hairpin RNA (shRNA) targeting HIF1a and HIF-2a and virus production methods were previously
described (8). pLKO.1-puro vectors encoding shP4HA1 and
shP4HA2 were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. P4HA1 and
P4HA2 lentiviral expression plasmids were generated by inserting cDNA for the coding sequence into a pENTR Gateway
vector (Invitrogen) followed by recombination with the pLentiCMV/TO-Zeo-DEST vector.
Immunoblot assays
Aliquots of whole-cell lysates prepared in NP-40 buffer were
fractionated by 8% SDS-PAGE. Conditioned medium was
concentrated by ammonium sulfate precipitation at 4 C overnight followed by centrifugation. Antibodies against HIF-1a
(BD Transduction Laboratory), P4HA1, P4HA2, HIF-2a,
COL1A1 (Novus Biologicals), and b-actin (Santa Cruz) were
used.
Orthotopic implantation and metastasis assays
Studies using 7- to 10-week-old female nonobese diabetic/
severe combined immunodeﬁcient (NOD/SCID) mice (NCI)
were carried out according to protocols approved by the Johns
Hopkins University Animal Care and Use Committee (Baltimore, MD). Mammary fat pad (MFP) injection, tumor growth
measurement, and human genomic DNA extraction from
mouse lungs were previously described (8). Mice were treated
with DHB [in 5% ethanol and 95% normal saline (v/v)] at 40
mg/kg/d by an intraperitoneal injection.
Real-time reverse transcription quantitative PCR
RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis was carried out as
previously described (8). The expression of each target mRNA
relative to 18S rRNA was calculated on the basis of the
threshold cycle (Ct) as 2D(DCt), where DCt ¼ Ct (target)  Ct
(18S). For primer sequences, see Supplementary Table S1.
Fibrillar collagen staining
Tumor sections were stained with 0.1% picrosirius red
(Direct Red 80, Sigma) and counterstained with Weigert
hematoxylin to reveal ﬁbrillar collagen. Sections were imaged
with an Olympus IX51 ﬂuorescence microscope ﬁtted with an

3286

Cancer Res; 73(11) June 1, 2013

analyzer (U-ANT) and polarizer (U-POT). The percentage of
collagen was quantiﬁed by calculating the area of red staining
relative to the total area of the tumor section using MetaMorph
analysis software.
Hydroxyproline content measurements
Cells were harvested and hydrolyzed in 6N HCl for 16 hours
at 116 C. Tumor tissue was excised, dried in a vacuum, and
hydrolyzed in 6N HCl for 16 hours at 116 C. Hydroxyproline
content was determined by a colorimetric method (32). The
total protein content was measured by the Bradford assay
using a commercial kit (Bio-Rad).
Immunohistochemistry
Lungs and lymph nodes were ﬁxed in 10% formalin and
parafﬁn embedded. Sections were dewaxed and hydrated.
LSABþ System HRP Kit (DAKO) was used for P4HA1, P4HA2,
and vimentin staining. HIF-1a staining was conducted as
described previously (33). Inﬂated lung sections were stained
with hematoxylin and eosin to visualize metastatic foci.
Statistical analysis
All statistical analysis was carried out using GraphPad
Prism software. Bonferroni posttests were conducted for all
ANOVAs. Data from The Cancer Genome Atlas was obtained
from http://tcga-data.nci.nih.gov/tcga/tcgaHome2.jsp. Oncomine data was obtained from the Richardson microarray
dataset (34). Survival analysis data was obtained from the
Pawitan microarray dataset (35) accessible through the
National Center for Biotechnology Information GEO database.
Tumor stiffness measurements
Tumor stiffness measurements were conducted using a
stepper motor (Harvard Apparatus) with a 1 mm diameter
probe perpendicular to a freshly excised and immobilized
tumor, with the corresponding force measured using a FlexiForce Load/Force Sensor (Tekscan). A constant impingement
rate was maintained and force was recorded at 300 Hz using
ELF software (TekScan). The slope of the indentation depth
versus impingement force was used as an effective stiffness
measurement.

Results
Inhibition of HIF-1a expression blocks hypoxia-induced
P4HA1 and P4HA2 expression
The ECM is a critical factor in the tumor microenvironment
(36–38). Analysis of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells exposed
to 20% or 1% O2 revealed that P4HA1 and P4HA2 mRNA were
highly induced under hypoxia (Supplementary Fig. S1A).
P4HA1 and P4HA2 protein levels were increased within 12
hours and remained elevated for 72 hours of continuous
hypoxia (Supplementary Fig. S1B). To determine whether
HIF-1a or HIF-2a was required for P4H expression under
hypoxic conditions, we used MDA-MB-231 subclones stably
transfected with an empty vector (EV) or expression vector(s)
encoding shRNA targeting HIF-1a (sh1a), HIF-2a (sh2a),
or HIF-1a, and HIF-2a (sh1/2a; ref. 8). Hypoxic induction

was silenced. Hypoxia-induced P4HA1 and P4HA2 mRNA
expression was also blocked by treatment with digoxin
(Supplementary Fig. S1A), which inhibits HIF-1a expression
(39). P4HA1 and P4HA2 expression was also induced under

as compared with shEV cells (Fig. 1C and Supplementary Fig.
S1D). Immunohistochemistry of tumor sections showed
intense nuclear HIF-1a staining in perinecrotic (hypoxic)
regions of the shEV tumors (Fig. 1D), which colocalized with
P4HA1 and P4HA2 (Fig. 1D and E and Supplementary Fig.
S1E). Staining of HIF-1a, P4HA1, and P4HA2 was attenuated
in sh1/2a tumor sections. Residual expression of HIF-1a in
sh1/2a tumors may reﬂect incomplete silencing of HIF-1a
expression in cancer cells or host-derived stromal cells,
which were not subjected to silencing, or both. Taken together, these data show that HIF-1 promotes collagen prolyl
hydroxylase expression in hypoxic breast cancer cells both
in vitro and in vivo.

Collagen prolyl hydroxylase knockdown inhibits breast
cancer growth and metastasis
To determine whether prolyl hydroxylases are required for
metastasis, we generated MDA-MB-231 subclones stably transfected with an empty vector (shLKO.1) or vector encoding
either of 2 different shRNAs against P4HA1 (shHA1-1 and
shHA1-2) or P4HA2 (shHA2-1 and shHA2-2). Immunoblot
assays conﬁrmed the knockdown of P4HA1 and P4HA2 (Fig.
2A). Primary tumor growth was attenuated by knockdown of
either P4HA1 or P4HA2 (Fig. 2B and C). Differences in cell
proliferation were observed in vitro (Supplementary Fig. S2A)
but were enhanced in vivo where the ECM may play a more
important role. More strikingly, spontaneous lung metastasis

was completely abrogated in mice bearing tumors derived
from P4HA1 or P4HA2 knockdown cells (Fig. 2D). Genomic
DNA was isolated from contralateral lungs and quantitative
real-time PCR (qPCR) using human-speciﬁc primers demonstrated that P4HA1 or P4HA2 knockdown reduced metastasis
by more than 99% (Fig. 2E).
To take into account differences in primary tumor growth
rates, we repeated the MFP injection and isolated tumors,
lungs, and lymph nodes when primary tumor volumes
reached 600 mm3. Control tumors reached 600 mm3 in
39 days, whereas P4HA knockdown tumors required 55 days
to reach the same tumor volume and weight (Fig. 2F and
Supplementary Fig. S2B). Despite the additional residence
time for P4HA knockdown cells, no lung metastases were
observed (Supplementary Fig. S2C). Human genomic DNA
content in the lungs indicated a 90% reduction in metastasis
of P4HA knockdown cells (Fig. 2G). In addition, lymphatic
metastasis was assessed using human vimentin immunohistochemical staining of ipsilateral axillary lymph nodes
(Fig. 2H). The area of vimentin staining was used to assess
breast cancer cell inﬁltration of mouse lymph nodes. Depletion of either P4HA1 or P4HA2 reduced lymphatic metastasis over 5-fold (Fig. 2I). Furthermore, the follicular lymph
node morphology was maintained only in the knockdown
mice. Immunohistochemical staining for P4HA1 and P4HA2
conﬁrmed expression in the perinecrotic regions of control
(shLKO.1) tumors and markedly decreased expression in
knockdown tumors (Fig. 2J). These results were consistent
with markedly reduced human-speciﬁc P4HA1 and P4HA2
mRNA expression, whereas mouse P4HA1 and P4HA2 mRNA
expression was not changed (Supplementary Fig. S2D–S2G).
Thus, expression of P4HA1 and P4HA2 by breast cancer
cells promotes primary tumor growth and lymphatic dissemination and is absolutely required for lung metastasis
independent of tumor size.
To quantify the extent to which cancer cells contributed
to collagen hydroxylase activity, we used primers speciﬁc
for human, mouse, or human and mouse P4HA1 mRNA. In
control (shLKO.1) tumors, human P4HA1 mRNA accounted for
87  5% (mean  SD) of total RNA, whereas mouse P4HA1
mRNA accounted for 9  5% (Supplementary Table S2),
suggesting the majority of P4HA1 activity originated from the
MDA-MB-231 cells.
Collagen hydroxylase knockdown decreases collagen
deposition in vitro and in vivo
The hydroxylation of collagen by prolyl hydroxylases is
crucial for the folding, stability, and secretion of the collagen
triple helix of all ﬁbrillar collagens (30, 40). We found that
secretion of type I collagen was abrogated by the knockdown
of HIF-1a, P4HA1, or P4HA2 (Fig. 3A and B). We examined
the localization of collagen deposition in tumor sections
using picrosirius red staining, which detects all ﬁbrillar
collagen (including types I, II, III, V, XI, XXIV, and XXVII)
when viewed under circularly polarized light (21). Overall
collagen content was greatest in perinecrotic regions (Fig.
3C and D), corresponding to sites of highest HIF-1a and
P4HA expression (Fig. 1D). Analysis of control tumors

www.aacrjournals.org

revealed highly aligned collagen ﬁbers in the perinecrotic
region of tumors, whereas the bulk of the tumor contained
discontinuous, fragmented collagen ﬁbers (Fig. 3D). The
knockdown of P4HA expression in breast cancer cells
resulted in a marked decrease in tumor collagen content
(both by picrosirius red and Masson trichrome staining)
and tumor stiffness in vivo (Fig. 3E and F and S3C). We
conﬁrmed a reduction in hydroxylase activity by measuring
collagen hydroxyproline content in tumor lysates, which
correlated with reduced P4HA1/2 mRNA expression (Fig.
3G and S2H-I). Differences in collagen content were also
observed when we compared tumor sections from control
shEV and sh1/2a subclones (Supplementary Fig. S3A and
S3B), indicating that HIF-1–dependent expression of prolyl
hydroxylases promotes collagen deposition in breast tumors.
To conﬁrm that our results were not cell line speciﬁc, we
generated MDA-MB-435 subclones (Supplementary Fig.
S4A). Primary tumor growth and metastasis were similar
to the corresponding MDA-MB-231 subclones (Supplementary Fig. S4B). Lung metastasis was severely impaired by the
P4HA knockdown and correlated with decreased tumor
stiffness (Supplementary Fig. S4C–S4E).
Collagen hydroxylase expression promotes cancer cell
invasion
Recent studies have shown that straightened and aligned
collagen ﬁbers in tumor samples are predictive of patient
mortality (41), presumably because collagen ﬁbers provide
directional cues that dictate cell morphology and promote
cell migration (24, 42) as well as induce stiffness, which
promotes tissue tension to enhance cancer progression
(16, 18). To determine whether collagen hydroxylase expression by breast cancer cells promotes invasion in vivo, we
analyzed control and P4HA knockdown tumor margins.
Knockdown tumors showed no evidence of invasion into
adjacent adipose tissue, whereas all control tumors showed
evidence of extensive local invasion (Fig. 4A).
Because in vitro assays of invasion (such as Boyden chamber assays) do not test the contribution of ECM to invasion,
we generated cell-free three-dimensional matrices from conﬂuent cultures of MDA-MB-231 control or P4HA knockdown
cells. We seeded na€ve MDA-MB-231 cells on these cellderived matrices and analyzed cell morphology. Compared
with cells plated on tissue culture plastic or ECM derived
from P4HA knockdown cells, cells seeded on ECM derived
from shLKO.1 cells had a spindle-shaped mesenchymal morphology (Fig. 4B), which is required for cell motility and
invasion (42, 43). To determine whether collagen deposited
within tumors promotes an invasive cell phenotype,
MDA-MB-231 cells were labeled with CMFDA (5-chloromethylﬂuorescein diacetate) and seeded onto control or
hydroxylase knockdown tumor sections. Following 24 hours
of cell seeding, sections were stained with picrosirius red and
imaged for cell–collagen interactions (Fig. 4C). In control
tumors, with abundant collagen content, the MDA-MB-231
cells aligned themselves along collagen ﬁbers with a spindleshaped morphology, which was quantiﬁed by calculation of
the elliptical factor (Fig. 4C, bar graph). In contrast, the P4HA

knockdown tumors did not contain sufﬁcient collagen to
promote cell elongation or directionality.
Collagen hydroxylases promote intravasation of breast
cancer cells
We hypothesized that reduced cell invasion should result
in reduced intravasation. To investigate the contribution of
P4HA expression to intravasation, we determined the number of circulating tumor cells (CTC) following MFP injection.
To construct a standard curve, we extracted total RNA from
0.5 mL of whole blood from nontumor-bearing mice mixed
with 0, 100, or 400 MDA-MB-231 cells and measured humanspeciﬁc rRNA levels (Fig. 5A). Human-speciﬁc rRNA levels in

3290

whole blood of tumor-bearing mice were compared with the
standard curve to quantify CTCs. P4HA knockdown significantly reduced the number of CTCs (Fig. 5B), suggesting
that reduced invasion resulted in decreased intravasation of
tumor cells.
To investigate the role of hydroxylase enzymes in premetastatic niche formation, we injected shEV-, shLOX-, shP4HA1-,
or shP4HA2 subclones and assessed collagen crosslinking in
the lung parenchyma [an early step in premetastatic niche
formation that is mediated by LOX (9, 31, 44)]. Unlike LOX
knockdown, P4HA1 or P4HA2 knockdown had no effect on
premetastatic niche formation (Fig. 5C and Supplementary Fig.
S5). This result is consistent with the role of collagen prolyl

hydroxylases as intracellular, nonsecreted enzymes as compared with LOX, which is an extracellular enzyme that modiﬁes
collagen already present in the ECM.
Next, we assessed extravasation by directly injecting MDAMB-231 subclones into the tail vein of mice. P4HA knockdown
did not affect the ability of cells to extravasate (Fig. 5D and E).
However, lung foci composed of P4HA knockdown cells were
smaller (Fig. 5D) and contained less collagen (Fig. 5F) than
control cell foci. Thus, P4HA knockdown signiﬁcantly reduces
intravasation but does not impair premetastatic niche formation or extravasation.
P4HA reexpression in HIF-deﬁcient cells rescues
collagen deposition and metastasis
To complement loss-of-function studies, MDA-MB231-sh1/2a cells were transduced with lentiviral vectors

www.aacrjournals.org

encoding full-length P4HA1 (HA1) or P4HA2 (HA2), or
with a control empty vector. MDA-MB-231-sh1/2aþHA1
(or þHA2) cells expressed P4HA levels comparable with
MDA-MB-231-EV cells exposed to 1% O2 (Supplementary
Fig. 6A). P4HA1 or P4HA2 overexpression in sh1/2a cells
increased tumor growth (Supplementary Fig. S6B and
S6C), promoted metastasis (Supplementary Fig. S6D–
S6F), recovered collagen content, and enhanced intravasation (Supplementary Fig. S6G–S6I). These data indicate that
P4HA1 and P4HA2 are critical components of the HIFdependent transcriptional response to hypoxia that promotes breast cancer metastasis. P4HA1 or P4HA2 overexpression could not fully compensate for the loss of HIF
activity with respect to metastasis, which is consistent with
the role of HIFs in the regulation of multiple genes involved
in metastasis (8, 9).

P4HA expression correlates with human breast cancer
prognosis
To investigate whether collagen prolyl hydroxylase
expression has clinical signiﬁcance for breast cancer prognosis, we analyzed P4HA1 and P4HA2 gene expression in
human breast cancer using the Oncomine database (34),
which revealed that P4HA levels were signiﬁcantly greater
in breast cancer tissue than in normal breast tissue (Fig.
6A). Results from an analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas
(http://tcga-data.nci.nih.gov) data were similar (Fig. 6B).
P4HA1 and P4HA2 expression showed highly signiﬁcant
associations with breast cancer stage, was independent of
hormone receptor status, but correlated with HER2 expression (Fig. 6C and Supplementary Table S3). P4HA1 and
P4HA2 mRNA levels (35) were also signiﬁcantly associated
with decreased patient survival (Fig. 6D). The survival
prediction was enhanced by further stratifying patients
using both P4HA1 and P4HA2 expression. Thus, expression
levels of collagen hydroxylases are prognostic in breast
cancer, which is consistent with their essential role in
promoting metastasis in the orthotopic transplantation
model.

Therapeutic efﬁcacy of collagen prolyl hydroxylase
inhibition by DHB
Collagen prolyl hydroxylases are members of a superfamily
of dioxygenases that use O2 and a-ketoglutarate as substrates
and are competitively inhibited by a-ketoglutarate analogs
such as DHB (Fig. 7A; ref. 45). To evaluate the therapeutic
efﬁcacy of inhibiting collagen hydroxylases, we used DHB,
which inhibits prolyl hydroxylase activity without affecting
total protein synthesis or DNA replication (46). We found that
DHB inhibited collagen secretion by cultured MDA-MB-231
cells in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 7B). Treatment of MDAMB-231 cells with DHB had only a modest inhibitory effect on
cell proliferation in vitro (Supplementary Fig. S7A). Next, we
established MFP tumors using MDA-MB-231-sh1/2aþHA1
cells to mitigate any confounding effects of DHB on HIF-1a
levels (which are negatively regulated by the HIF prolyl hydroxylase PHD2) while maintaining levels of P4HA1. Systemic
treatment of mice with 40 mg/kg per day of DHB led to
modestly decreased primary tumor growth (Fig. 7C), but
signiﬁcantly reduced collagen content (Fig. 7D and E) and
lung metastasis (Fig. 7F and G) without affecting body weight
(Supplementary Fig. S7B). These results suggest that DHB (and

novel pharmacologic strategy to inhibit metastasis, especially
in patients with breast cancer with increased levels of P4HA
mRNA demonstrable in tumor biopsies.

Discussion
Although several studies have reported increased collagen
deposition during breast cancer progression (19, 41, 47), this
is the ﬁrst study to uncover a molecular mechanism linking
intratumoral hypoxia, collagen deposition, and breast
cancer invasion and metastasis. We showed that hypoxiainduced HIF-1 transcriptional activity upregulates collagen
prolyl hydroxylase expression to dictate tumor collagen
content, organization, density, and stiffness in breast cancer
(Fig. 7H). We determined that collagen prolyl hydroxylases
are essential for the metastasis of MDA-MB-231 and MDAMB-435 breast cancer cells to the lungs of NOD/SCID mice
by enhancing tissue invasion and intravasation. Moreover,
we showed the prognostic signiﬁcance of P4HA mRNA
expression and identiﬁed a novel potential therapeutic
intervention.
Collagen hydroxylases establish a tumor ECM that
facilitates metastasis
Collagen content and organization have been shown to
promote cancer progression by several mechanisms. Fibrillar
collagen content affects the biophysical properties of the ECM
(16–18). In our study, decreased P4HA expression reduced
tumor stiffness and density by reducing the amount of collagen
in the ECM. Increased breast cancer stiffness facilitates integrin clustering to promote focal adhesions, which drive invasion

(18). Collagen ﬁber alignment has been shown to play a critical
role in directing the migration of tumor cells in vivo (25). We
found that aligned collagen ﬁbers were localized to perinecrotic (hypoxic) regions of tumors. Furthermore, we determined that cancer cells aligned themselves along these ﬁbers,
adopting a spindle-shaped morphology. Cancer cells seeded on
P4HA knockdown tumor sections, in which collagen deposition was signiﬁcantly decreased, remained rounded and lacked
directionality. Although the importance of collagen content in
the tumor microenvironment has been well reported (48), this
study is the ﬁrst to highlight a pathophysiologic mechanism (i.
e., intratumoral hypoxia) that leads to increased collagen
deposition during breast cancer progression. Whereas prior
studies have focused on the role of stromal cells, the present
study shows that breast cancer cells may also make a critical
contribution to ECM remodeling during cancer progression.
Collagen hydroxylases promote intravasation but not
extravasation or premetastatic niche formation
P4HA1 or P4HA2 knockdown prevented cancer cells from
invading adjacent fat tissue, decreased the number of CTCs,
and blocked lung metastasis, showing the role of these collagen
modifying enzymes in promoting hematogenous dissemination of breast cancer cells to the lungs and possibly other
organs. In contrast, P4HA knockdown had no effect on the
number of lung foci that formed after direct injection into the
tail vein of the mice. Taken together, these data indicate that
P4HA1 and P4HA2 play an important role in promoting
intravasation by enhancing tissue invasion, whereas they do
not affect extravasation. Unlike the secreted enzymes, LOX,
LOXL2, and LOXL4, which have been shown to inﬂuence

HIF-1 regulates multiple steps in collagen biogenesis
Prior studies focused on the late stages of collagen maturation and crosslinking mediated by the LOX family of extracellular enzymes (9, 31, 44, 49). The present study highlights the
importance of the initial intracellular steps in collagen biogenesis, which control the amount of collagen available for
crosslinking. Taken together, HIF-1 affects both early (intracellular) and late (extracellular) steps in collagen ﬁbril forma-

tion. This is important because ﬁbrotic breast cancers have the
poorest prognosis and highest rate of recurrence (50) and in
mouse models, increased type I collagen is associated with
increased tumor growth and lung metastasis (19).
In addition to prolyl hydroxylation, the other major posttranslational modiﬁcation of procollagen prior to secretion is
lysyl hydroxylation, which is also induced by hypoxia in a HIF1-dependent manner and is required for breast cancer metastasis (51). Knockdown of prolyl hydroxylase expression in
breast cancer cells blocks collagen deposition in the primary
tumor, whereas knockdown of lysyl hydroxylase expression has
no effect on collagen deposition but speciﬁcally impairs

collagen ﬁber formation (51). Thus, the coordinate transcriptional activation of genes encoding prolyl and lysyl hydroxylases in hypoxic breast cancer cells is critical for ECM remodeling that promotes local invasion as well as lymphatic and
hematogenous metastasis.
These ﬁndings, taken together with the dramatic effect of
P4HA1 or P4HA2 knockdown, indicate that collagen prolyl
hydroxylases represent an important new therapeutic target
for the prevention of metastasis in breast cancer. The data also
support a novel paradigm of cancer cells directly contributing
to the prometastatic microenvironment of the primary tumor
by promoting ECM production. Given that cancer-associated
ﬁbroblasts and myoﬁbroblasts contribute to ECM assembly,
drugs targeting collagen hydroxylase expression, ECM maintenance, and/or HIF activity must effectively target cancer as
well as stromal cells. Drugs such as digoxin that inhibit HIF-1
activity may be beneﬁcial because they inhibit tumor ﬁbrosis
by blocking multiple steps in collagen biogenesis as well as
affecting other critical aspects of the metastatic process
(8, 9, 44, 52).
Inhibitors of collagen prolyl hydroxylases or HIF-1 as
potential therapeutics for cancer
The MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-435 cell lines were derived from triple-negative breast cancers, which lack signiﬁcant expression of the estrogen receptor, progesterone
receptor, or HER2. A recent analysis of more than 500
samples of patients with breast cancer conducted by the
Cancer Genome Atlas Network found a signiﬁcant association between HIF-1 pathway activation and triple-negative
breast cancers (53) highlighting the potential impact of

inhibitors of collagen prolyl hydroxylases or HIF-1 on this
patient subset, which responds poorly to currently available
therapies (54).
