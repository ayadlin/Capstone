Summary

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Telomeres are thought to be maintained by the preferential recruitment of telomerase to the shortest
telomeres. The extension of the G-rich telomeric strand by telomerase is also believed to be
coordinated with the complementary synthesis of the C-strand by the conventional replication
machinery. However, we show that under telomere length-maintenance conditions in cancer cells,
human telomerase extends most chromosome ends during each S phase and is not preferentially
recruited to the shortest telomeres. Telomerase rapidly extends the G-rich strand following telomere
replication but fill-in of the C-strand is delayed into late S phase. This late C-strand fill-in is not
executed by conventional Okazaki fragment synthesis but by a mechanism using a series of small
incremental steps. These findings highlight differences between telomerase actions during steady
state versus non-equilibrium conditions and reveal steps in the human telomere maintenance pathway
that may provide additional targets for the development of anti-telomerase therapeutics.

Introduction

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The ends of linear eukaryotic chromosomes are capped by telomeres that protect chromosome
termini from degradation, end-to-end fusion and recombination (Blackburn, 2001; de Lange,
2002). In human cells, the DNA component of telomeres is composed of ~5–15kb of doublestranded 5’-TTAGGG-3’ repeats terminating in a 3’ single-stranded overhang of ~12–300
bases (Makarov et al., 1997; Wright et al., 1997; Zhao et al., 2008). Because of the
unidirectional nature of DNA polymerase and processing events, human telomeres lose ~50–
200 base pairs during each cell division. Eventually, critically short telomeres trigger
replicative senescence or apoptosis (Smogorzewska and De Lange, 2004). The majority of
tumor cells and germ line cells overcome this proliferative limit by the action of telomerase, a
ribonucleoprotein with reverse transcriptase activity that adds telomeric DNA repeats to the

3’ overhang of telomeres (Collins and Mitchell, 2002; Greider and Blackburn, 1985; Kim et
al., 1994). An understanding of telomerase biology thus has important implications for both
cancer and aging.
A central question in telomere biology concerns how telomerase maintains telomere length.
Many reports indicate that telomerase is preferentially recruited to the shortest telomeres
(Bianchi and Shore, 2008; Hemann et al., 2001; Marcand et al., 1997; Ouellette et al., 2000;
Samper et al., 2001; Steinert et al., 2000; Zhu et al., 1998). In these studies the data supporting
this conclusion were obtained under conditions of changing telomere length, and it is unknown
whether significant preference for the shortest telomeres exists when overall telomere length
is being maintained. Six essential proteins form a complex called shelterin that binds telomeric
DNA, and all are believed to play important roles in the recruitment and regulation of
telomerase at the G-strand (Bianchi and Shore, 2008; Palm and de Lange, 2008). Several studies
indicate that disruption of C-strand DNA synthesis can also impair telomere length control
(Price, 1997).

In the ciliate Euplotes, inhibition of DNA polymerase α and β during de novo telomere synthesis
alters telomeric C-strand length and also causes an increase in G-strand length (Fan and Price,
1997). Similarly, propagation of S. cerevisiae strains defective for components of the lagging
strand replication machinery causes a telomerase-dependent increase in telomere length
(Adams and Holm, 1996; Adams Martin et al., 2000). Mouse cells harboring a temperaturesensitive allele of DNA polymerase α undergo sequential G-rich overhang elongation (that is
not dependent on telomerase) followed by a marked increase in overall telomere length (that
is telomerase dependent) (Nakamura et al., 2005).
Following extension of the 3' end of the G-rich strand by telomerase, fill in synthesis of the
complementary C-strand completes replication of the double-stranded telomeric DNA.
Increasing evidence shows that C-strand fill-in can be tightly regulated. In Euplotes, the newly
synthesized G-strands are heterogeneous in length with the majority 95–100 nucleotides long.
In contrast, most C-strands are exactly 84 nucleotides long, suggesting that the length of the
C-strand is the more precisely regulated step (Price et al., 1994). End-processing of the Cstrand is also more specific than that of the G-strand. Up to 80% of the C-rich strands terminate
in CCAATC-5’ in human cells, whereas the G-terminal nucleotide is less precise (Sfeir et al.,
2005).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

S. cerevisiae telomeres replicate late in S phase due to late firing of subtelomeric origins of
DNA replication (McCarroll and Fangman, 1988). Elongation of an artificially shortened
telomere coincides with semiconservative telomere replication, which occurs very late in S
phase (Marcand et al., 2000), suggesting coupling between the two processes. De novo addition
of a telomere to a newly created double strand (ds) break adjacent to a telomere seeding
sequence also suggests coupling between the replication machinery and telomerase. Using an
inducible HO endonuclease to control the timing, Diede and Gottshling (Diede and Gottschling,
1999) showed that telomerase addition could not occur during G1 but that it could in M-phase
arrested cells. This allowed them to explore the role of essential DNA polymerase components
after a normal S-phase was completed. Telomere addition of even the G-rich strand was blocked
in the absence of Pol α, Pol δ and DNA primase (Diede and Gottschling, 1999), reinforcing
the concept that telomerase addition and C-strand fill-in are coupled to the replication complex.
Human telomeres replicate throughout S phase (Ten Hagen et al., 1990; Wright et al., 1999),
providing the opportunity to distinguish whether telomerase extension/processing is a late S/
G2/M process or is directly coupled to semiconservative replication. Recent in situ analysis
indicates an S-phase-specific co-localization of telomerase with small numbers of telomeres
at any one time (Jady et al., 2006; Tomlinson et al., 2006), consistent with telomerase extension

occurring during the heterogeneous replication of telomeres throughout S phase. However,
direct proof that telomerase action is restricted to this part of the cell cycle is lacking. We
developed several independent assays to monitor G-strand extension and C-strand fill-in. We
demonstrate that telomere elongation by telomerase occurs within 30 minutes of telomere
replication throughout S phase, and that 70%-100% of the ends in Hela and H1299 cells are
extended during each cell cycle. Telomerase is thus not preferentially recruited to the shortest
telomeres under steady state conditions of telomere length maintenance. We also observed the
unanticipated result that C-strand fill-in is delayed until late S phase. The demonstration that
fill-in is uncoupled from telomerase extension defines a two-step model for telomere
maintenance in cancer cells, implies an unexpected regulatory step in telomere extension, and
provides a target for telomerase-inhibition therapies.

Results
C-strand fill-in is delayed after telomerase elongation

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Single Telomere Length Analysis (STELA) (Baird et al., 2003) can determine the length of
individual human telomeres, and thus their elongation by telomerase during a single cell cycle.
For this purpose, the approximate timing of replication of the target telomere needs to be
established, telomeres need to be short and uniform enough so that small changes can be
detected, and telomeres need to be elongating so that a change in length can be detected. We
first determined the timing of replication of the Xp/Yp telomere in human fibroblasts.
ReDFISH (Bailey et al., 2004; Zou et al., 2004) (Fig. 1A) produces a specific pattern of
hybridization of telomeres that have replicated during a pulse of 5-bromodeoxyuridine/
bromodoxycytidine (BrdU/BrdC). The removal of the BrdU/BrdC-containing strands allows
hybridization of fluorescent C-rich and G-rich probes to only one of the two daughter
chromatids at each end. The fractions of ends exhibiting this pattern are then determined by
hourly pulses during S phase. 70% of the Xp/Yp telomeres replicate between 2–4 hours
following release from a hydroxyurea block (Fig. 1B). This timing, occurring relatively early,
provided a good window for distinguishing events coupled to replication from those that occur
late in S-phase.

Human fibroblasts have telomeres that are sufficiently long so that measuring small changes
during a single S-phase would be difficult. Therefore, a clone of A549 lung cancer cells was
picked that had very short telomeres (~3.5kb). This clone was treated with the telomerase
inhibitor GRN163L (Herbert et al., 2005) in order to induce further telomere shortening.
Finally, it was transduced with a retrovirus overexpressing the human TERT catalytic subunit
in order to cause rapid enough telomere elongation to measure in a single cell cycle. Telomere
length immediately following infection was 2.5kb, which elongated at about 500 bp/division
during the first few divisions (Fig. 2A). Cells were synchronized at G1/S using aphidicolin
immediately after selection for antibiotic resistance, and then samples were harvested every
two hours for FACS (Fig. 2B) and STELA (Fig. 2C–E). Approximately 100 individual
telomeric bands were analyzed at each time point. The size of the Xp telomere increased by
approximately 250 bp between 4 and 6 hours after release into S phase. FACS analysis indicated
that ~50% of the cells entered S phase following release (Fig. 2B, time points 6 and 8 hours),
so the measured rate of telomere elongation by STELA (~250 nt) corresponds closely with the
value predicted from telomere restriction fragment gels (~500 bp ÷2) (Fig. 2A).
Comparison of the FACS profile of BJ fibroblasts synchronized with hydroxyurea and A549
cells synchronized with aphidicolin show similar rates of progression through S phase, so most
of the Xp/Yp telomeres in A549 cells should have replicated by 4 hours after release (Fig. 2B).
ReDFISH analysis of A549 cells confirmed that most Xp/Yp replication had occurred by 4
hours after release (data not shown). However, STELA products only elongated after 6 hours
(Fig. 2D–E). This raised the possibility that telomerase action might be delayed following

replication. However, the STELA procedure used above measures the size of the C-rich
telomeric strand, and telomerase might have elongated the G-rich strand at an earlier time. The
samples were thus reanalyzed using a modification in which a long C-rich oligonucleotide is
first annealed to the telomeric overhangs (Sfeir et al., 2005). This "platform" oligonucleotide
creates a single-stranded C-rich overhang to which an appropriately modified G-telorette
oligonucleotide can be annealed and ligated to the G-strand (Fig. 2F). Amplification then
occurs based upon the length of the G- rather than the C-strand. G-strand STELA products
exhibited an ~250 nt elongation between 2 and 4 hours after release into S phase, consistent
with the timing of replication of the Xp/Yp telomere (Fig. 2G–H). This established that there
is a significant delay between the time at which telomerase elongates the G-strand (2–4 hours)
and when the extended overhang is filled in (starting at 6 hours). Control experiments using
asynchronously dividing cells showed only the expected ~100 nt difference between G- and
C-strands due to the 3’overhangs (see Figure S1 in the Supplemental Data).
Overhangs become longer during S phase

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

A delay between the extension of the G-strand by telomerase and the fill-in of the C-strand on
the Xp/Yp telomere predicts that overhang length on other telomeres should become longer
during S phase than in either G1 or G2. Global overhang length was analyzed using DSN
(duplex specific nuclease), which digests total double-stranded DNA to <10 bp while leaving
the single-stranded telomeric overhang intact (Zhao et al., 2008). Because of the anticipated
large size of these overhangs, the DNA was run on agarose rather than the polyacrylamide gels
usually used for this analysis. Fig. 3A shows that total overhangs become hundreds of nt longer
during S phase, confirming the STELA results that very long G-overhangs accumulate on many
different chromosome ends in these cells and that C-strand fill-in is delayed until the end of S
phase.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The A549 experiments used cells overexpressing telomerase, which might have altered normal
replication and processing. We thus examined overhang length in synchronized Hela cells
expressing only endogenous telomerase. Because of their heterogeneity, the overhangs exhibit
a wide distribution of sizes on polyacrylamide gels (Fig. 3B). After adjusting the signal
intensity for size (since longer overhangs hybridize to more probe), the average overhang size
was compared at different times after release into S-phase. Total overhang length increased
from ~65 nt to ~105 nt by 6 hours after release, dropping back to 65 nt by 10 hours. The results
from this DSN analysis were compared to that from native gel hybridization, in which the
signal hybridizing to the overhang in double-stranded (native) telomeres is compared to the
total telomere signal following denaturation. This only gives a relative value for the size of the
overhang rather than a quantitative measure, but it confirmed the progressive elongation of the
overhangs during S phase (Fig.3C). Repetitive analysis of logarithmically growing Hela cells
did not show a change in relative overhang length (see Figure S2 in the Supplemental Data).
In order to increase the resolution for how quickly telomerase acted following replication, we
looked at overhang lengths in telomeres labeled during a very short BrdU exposure. Hela cells
were released into S phase and then either continuously exposed to BrdU or pulsed for 30
minutes in mid-S and harvested immediately. DNA that had replicated during the 30 minute
pulse was separated from unreplicated and previously replicated DNA on CsCl gradients (Fig.
3D). The increased amount of BrdU incorporated into the G-rich telomeric sequence allows
the separation of daughter strands synthesized by leading and lagging strand synthesis (Chai
et al., 2006). Figure. 3E shows that the average size of both leading and lagging strand
overhangs is elongated within 30 minutes of replication. Figure 3F quantitates the differences
shown in 3E as a function of size, and shows that at 30 min twice as many overhangs are longer
than 50 nt (60–70% vs 30%) than at 8 hours for both leading and lagging daughter telomeres.

Direct evidence of elongation by telomerase

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

S. cerevesia telomeres exhibit a transient increase in overhang length at the end of S-phase
(Wellinger et al., 1996; Wellinger et al., 1993). Because this transient increase is also observed
in the absence of telomerase, it is presumed to represent a resection of the C-rich strand.
Although we did not observe a statistically significant decrease in C-strand STELA Xp/Yp
products during the first four hours after release into S phase, the standard deviations are large
and we do not believe we could have detected a 50 nt decrease in length. It thus remains formally
possible that the increase in overhang length observed in Fig. 3 is due to C-strand resection
rather than telomerase elongation. In order to provide direct evidence for elongation by
telomerase, we examined the BrdU content of lagging strand overhangs. The parental G-strand
provides the template for lagging strand synthesis, and following replication initially contains
only thymidine in synchronized cells released into S-phase in the presence of BrdU (Fig. 4A).
However, if telomerase acts it will incorporate BrdU into the newly synthesized GGTTAG
repeats. If C-strand fill-in is delayed, these overhangs will then contain a mixture of thymidine
and BrdU containing repeats and should have an intermediate density on CsCl gradients.
Depending on the amount of elongation, C-strand fill-in might then convert the thymidinecontaining portion of the overhang to ds DNA, leaving a fully BrdU substituted overhang.
Since the G-rich strand is the newly synthesized strand during leading strand synthesis, its
overhangs will be fully BrdU substituted regardless of whether or not telomerase has acted.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Despite their small size and thus high rates of diffusion, we were able to separate thymidine
containing and fully BrdU-substituted overhangs on CsCl gradients (Fig. 4B). The signals were
abolished by treatment with the 3' to 5' nuclease Exo I prior to DSN digestion, showing that
the signals on slot blots used to analyze the gradient were not due to small undigested dsDNA
(data not shown). Synchronized Hela cells were released for 3 hours in the presence of BrdU.
Total DNA was digested with DSN and the surviving single-stranded G-rich overhangs were
separated on CsCl gradients. The intermediate density peak half-way between the thymidine
and fully substituted overhangs directly demonstrates that telomerase elongation of the lagging
overhangs had occurred (Fig. 4C). This intermediate density peak was absent in similar
experiments performed on normal human fibroblasts (telomerase-negative) and Hela cells in
which telomerase had been inhibited with the hTR-template antagonist GRN163L,
demonstrating that it required active telomerase to be produced. Probing the slot blot with a
G-rich probe to identify the presence of any C-strand DNA surviving the DSN digestion gave
only background signals (Fig. 4D), further confirming that the intermediate peak represented
G-rich single-stranded overhangs.
Delay of C-strand fill-in until late S phase

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The time course of telomerase extension and C-strand fill-in was examined at different intervals
after release from a G1/S block. Figure 5B shows that increasing amounts of intermediate
density overhangs accumulated until 4–6 hours after release. By 8 hours, the intermediate
density peak disappeared, and the relative intensity of the thymidine and BrdU overhang peaks
matched the FACS profile of cells still in G1 versus those in late S/G2 (Fig. 5A). The early
appearance of intermediate density overhangs and their late conversion into fully substituted
overhangs confirmed that telomerase action and C-strand fill-in are uncoupled, and extension
products do not get filled-in until late S phase.
The data in Figure 5B was obtained in the continuous presence of BrdU. In order to follow a
single cohort of replicated telomeres, cells were pulsed with BrdU for the first 2.5 hours after
release from a G1/S block and then chased for different times (Fig. 5C). A distinct peak of
intermediate density overhangs appeared during the first 2.5 hour pulse, which persisted at the
5 hour time point before disappearing in DNA isolated 8 hours after release (Fig. 5D). Thus,

even the telomeres that had replicated at the earliest time point had their overhangs extended
by telomerase early, and delayed C-strand fill-in until late S.

Most lagging strand telomeres are extended by telomerase each cell cycle

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

It is currently unknown whether telomerase maintains telomeres by adding small amounts to
most of the telomeres during each cell division or by adding much more to a small fraction of
the ends. The intensity of the intermediate density peak in Fig. 4–Fig. 5 suggested that a large
fraction of the ends were being extended, and the intermediate density suggested that the
amount added was approximately equal to the size of the newly replicated lagging daughter
overhang. In order to directly determine the fraction of extended lagging ends, we labeled Hela
cells with BrdU for the first four hours following replication, and then purified lagging daughter
telomeres on CsCl gradients (Fig. 6A). These telomeres were then digested with DSN and their
overhangs reanalyzed on a second CsCl gradient. Telomeres that had not been elongated by
telomerase should contain only thymidine (Fig. 4A). Most of the replicated telomeres exhibited
overhangs with an intermediate density (Fig. 6B), indicating that in Hela cells telomerase is
maintaining telomere length by elongating most of the ends during every cell division. Fitting
the observed distribution to overlapping Gaussian distributions indicated that ~18% of the
signal was in the thymidine-only peak (Fig. 6C). The position of the intermediate-density peak
half-way between the thymidine only and fully BrdU substituted peaks implies that the
telomerase-extended overhangs are twice as long and have roughly equal numbers of thymidine
and BrdU-containing repeats. They will thus give twice the signal per overhang when probed.
Normalizing the signals for this difference indicated that ~70% of the telomeres were elongated
by telomerase during every cell cycle (Fig. 6D). The fraction of ends elongated by telomerase
was also examined in a second tumor cell line, H1299 lung adenocarcinoma cells. In these
cells, 100% of the lagging daughter overhangs exhibited an intermediate density and were thus
elongated by telomerase during a single cell cycle (Fig. 6 E&F). Analysis of the unreplicated
and leading fractions yielded overhangs containing only thymidine or BrdU respectively (Fig.
6 G&H).

Discussion

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The investigation of telomerase action in cells has been challenging. Telomere length
measurement on gels by TRF permits monitoring the long-term consequences of telomerase
activity but only provides an average of many telomeres over many divisions. The STELA
based method allows the length of chromosome-specific telomeres to be measured during a
single cell cycle under conditions of changing telomere length. The BrdU/DSN method is able
to monitor groups of replicating telomeres, and has the advantage that it provides a direct
measurement of telomerase activity on lagging strand daughter telomeres in cells expressing
only their endogenous telomerase. Both STELA and DSN demonstrate that telomerase
extension occurs soon after replication. This is consistent with yeast observations (Teixeira et
al., 2004) and in situ cytological evidence showing the S-phase-specific association of
telomerase with telomeres (Jady et al., 2006; Tomlinson et al., 2006). However, the
demonstration that fill-in is uncoupled from extension and delayed until late S phase represents
an entirely unanticipated result that indicates an additional regulatory step in telomere
replication. Blocking this step could potentially increase the efficacy of telomerase-inhibition
of cancer cells.
Cell cycle-dependent regulation of telomerase extension
In yeast, passage of the replication fork is required before telomerase can act (Dionne and
Wellinger, 1998; Marcand et al., 2000), and adding a de novo telomere during M-phase requires
pol α, pol β and primase components of the replication complex (Diede and Gottschling,
1999). This suggests a coupling of telomerase action and telomere replication. The

asynchronous timing of human telomere replication and the in situ demonstration that hTERT
and hTR (hTERC) only associate with a few telomeres during any specific time during S-phase
(Jady et al., 2006; Tomlinson et al., 2006) is consistent with telomerase being recruited to act
rapidly following replication. Our results provide direct evidence that telomerase elongates
human telomeres within 30 minutes following replication.
C-strand fill-in at the end of S phase

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

ChIP analysis has revealed the association of many DNA repair factors at telomeres at the end
of S-phase (Verdun et al., 2005). In addition to ATM and the MRN complex, the localization
of factors involved in the repair of stalled replication fork such as ATR, Rad17, Fen1 and DNA
polymerase β led to the hypothesis that telomere replication might be stalled during S-phase
("phase I"), and that restart, completion of synthesis and G-overhang generation only occurred
in late S/G2 ("phase II") (Verdun and Karlseder, 2006). Several lines of evidence argue against
this interpretation. First, STELA of the Xp/Yp established that telomerase extends the G-strand
2–4 hours after release into S-phase (Fig. 2). In order to be compatible with stalled forks at
telomeres, this would require telomerase to act before replication of the 3' end of the telomere
was complete. This has been considered as a formal possibility (Chakhparonian and Wellinger,
2003). This could produce the increased overhang size observed as S phase progresses (Fig.
3). However, in the absence of completion of telomere replication all of the overhangs would
be composed of unreplicated thymidine-containing overhangs that had not been extended by
telomerase or intermediate density overhangs that had been extended, and there should be no
fully-substituted overhangs. Approximately equal amounts of intermediate and heavy
overhangs were observed, even at the earliest time points measured (Fig. 5B). Furthermore,
when the overhangs from unreplicated DNA were examined, no heavy or hybrid density
overhangs were found (Fig. 6G). This thus eliminates the possibility that telomerase might act
on stalled replication forks prior to the completion of both leading and lagging daughter
telomere replication. Second, if telomerase acted prior to replication, one would expect normal
lagging strand synthesis to copy much of the extended overhang, preventing the appearance
of the observed intermediate density overhangs in the DSN analysis and producing an early
elongation of the C-strand by STELA. This was not observed. Finally, stalled replication forks
would yield a complex pattern and not the clean separation of leading versus lagging telomeres
on CsCl gradients within 30 minutes of replication that was observed (Fig. 3D).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Because a free G-rich overhang is required at both elongation and fill-in steps, it is difficult to
imagine a mechanism by which t-loops could be maintained both during replication and during
C-strand fill-in. It is unknown at present what fraction of ends are in t-loops, whether or not tloops re-fold immediately following replication or whether telomeres remain as linear
molecules with "free" 3'-overhangs until after C-strand fill-in occurs. The recognition of
telomeres as damaged DNA at the end of S-phase (Verdun et al., 2005) is consistent with a
signal for C-strand fill-in, t-loop re-folding or both. It is also possible that t-loops refold after
replication and then are unfolded again at the end of S-phase in order to permit the final stages
of C-strand replication to occur.
Incremental C-strand fill-in
An obvious mechanism for C-strand fill-in would use the conventional lagging-strand
machinery, in which pol α/primase produces an RNA primer that is extended and added to the
end of the C-strand. If the primer was synthesized ~50–100 nt from the end of the extended
G-strand, the newly synthesized "Okazaki-like fragment" would rapidly convert the thymidinecontaining portion of the single-stranded lagging overhang to double-stranded DNA, so that
the remaining overhang would be fully substituted with BrdU. This would cause each molecule
in the intermediate density pool of extended overhangs to rapidly transit from an intermediate
to a heavy density, so that the intermediate peak should decrease and the heavy peak should

increase with time. This is not what was observed. The six hour time point in Fig. 5B clearly
shows that the intermediate density overhang peak has shifted to higher but not fully substituted
densities, implying an incremental fill-in of the C-strand. The mechanism for this incremental
process remains to be determined.
Fraction of extended ends

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Approximately 70 % of Hela and 100% of H1299 lagging strand telomeres are elongated during
one cell cycle under telomere steady state maintenance conditions, in which total telomere
length is neither elongating nor shortening. Telomerase activity has been shown to be
sporadically absent in Hela cells. Approximately 35% of Hela clones lacked telomerase activity
immediately after cloning but became positive with further culture (Bryan et al., 1998). This
suggests that almost all of the telomeres are being extended in the ~65% of Hela cells that are
telomerase positive at any point in time, and that the fraction of extended ends is close to 100%
in both Hela and H1299 cells. Preliminary data suggests that the majority of ends in human
ES cells are also extended by telomerase during every cell cycle (data not shown). This is very
different from the pattern observed in yeast, where only a small fraction (~7%) of ends are
extended (Teixeira et al., 2004). Yeast telomeres only shorten at a rate of ~3 nt/division in the
absence of telomerase (Marcand et al., 1999). Since yeast telomerase adds an average of 44
nucleotides when it acts on wt telomeres >200 in length (Teixeira et al., 2004), it could not
extend a large fraction of ends without increasing overall telomere length. In contrast, human
telomeres generally shorten at a rate of 50–100 nt/division in cell culture. In order to maintain
a constant telomere length, human telomerase would thus either have to add kilobases of repeats
to a small fraction of ends or 50–100 nt to most of the ends. The size of the intermediate density
lagging daughter overhangs extended by telomerase is about 100 nucleotides (Fig. 3E), and its
density implies an equal number of thymidine and fully-substituted repeats. This implies that
the lagging-strand overhang prior to telomerase elongation is about 50 nt and that telomerase
adds about 50 nt. Hela telomeres shorten by ~45 bp/cell division when telomerase activity is
inhibited (Fig. S3 Supplemental data). The increase in size of ~50 nt to 70% of the ends during
each cell cycle is roughly consistent with the amount that would need to be added to counteract
telomere shortening. The amount of elongation produced following telomerase action is thus
similar in S. cerevisiae and humans (44 vs ~50 nt), while the fraction of ends extended is an
order of magnitude larger in humans (7% vs 70%-100%).

In the absence of changes in the rate of shortening, any model of telomere homeostasis requires
that telomerase acts more when telomeres are too short and less when telomeres get too long.
The shelterin complex has been implicated as part of the mechanism by which length is
measured, since reducing shelterin components causes telomere elongation and overexpression
of shelterin components leads to telomere shortening (reviewed in (Bianchi and Shore, 2008;
Palm and de Lange, 2008)). There is currently a general consensus that telomerase is
preferentially recruited to the shortest telomeres (Bianchi and Shore, 2008; Hemann et al.,
2001; Marcand et al., 1997; Ouellette et al., 2000; Samper et al., 2001; Zhu et al., 1998).
However, all of the above studies examined non-equilibrium conditions in which telomere
length was changing. Although telomerase is preferentially recruited to the shortest telomere
when it is restored to yeast mutants with artificially shortened telomeres, under length
maintenance conditions in wt yeast telomerase randomly extends ends independent of length
(Teixeira et al., 2004). Siince 70% (Hela) and 100% (H1299) of telomere ends are extended
in every cell cycle in cancer cells maintaining a stable telomere length is inconsistent with a
significant preference between telomeres. Under length maintenance conditions, although
occasional telomeres may become too long or too short and be preferentially ignored or
elongated, the vast majority of ends are treated equally. This suggests that the sensitivity for
determining telomere length is sufficiently coarse that under maintenance conditions
telomerase does not distinguish between slightly longer and slightly shorter telomeres, while

it can be preferentially recruited to the shortest telomeres when the departure from the
appropriate maintenance length is large. Regulation of the recruitment/action of telomerase on
telomeres thus varies with context and is likely to depend on multiple different factors.
Extension of leading ends

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The increased length of leading daughter telomeric overhangs during S-phase (Fig. 3E) is
consistent with the hypothesis that telomerase is elongating both leading and lagging daughter
chromatids. In contrast to telomerase-negative cells, in which lagging overhangs are ~3 times
longer than leading overhangs (Zhao et al., 2008), fully processed leading and lagging
overhangs are approximately the same size in telomerase-expressing cells (Fig. 3E & Fig. 3F
and (Chai et al., 2006)). However, the initially extended overhangs of leading telomeric
daughter strands are smaller than that of lagging daughters (70 vs 100 nt, Fig. 3E). This is
consistent with the concept that immediately following replication the presumably blunt
leading daughter is processed to yield a shorter overhang than is present on lagging daughters.
However, it is currently unknown how much C-strand processing occurs before telomerase
acts. It is possible that, as in yeast, a transient long G-rich overhang occurs that is later filled
in, so that the simple measurement of an increased length does not rigorously distinguish
between C-strand resection and telomerase elongation. However, the ~50nt added by
telomerase to 70% of the lagging ends is unlikely to be sufficient to maintain telomere length
unless telomerase is also adding ~50 nt to 70% of the leading ends. If this is the case, the size
of the 30% non-extended leading overhangs would be ~35nt (the same size as leading
overhangs in telomerase-negative fibroblasts (Zhao et al., 2008)) and that of the 70% extended
overhangs would be 85nt prior to C-strand fill-in (yielding the observed average of 70 nt). Our
data thus supports a working model that shortly following replication leading overhangs in
Hela cells are ~35nt, lagging overhangs are ~50nt, and that telomerase adds ~50nt to 70% of
both leading and lagging ends.
The processivity of telomerase on model substrates increases from one to about four in the
presence of both Pot1 and TPP1(Wang et al., 2007). Four repeats accounts for only half of the
observed ~50nt telomerase extension. Either other factors are contributing to telomerase
processivity in vivo, or telomerase is acting more than once on each telomere per cell cycle.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The end-replication problem does not produce shortening of the lagging daughter telomere, so
telomerase extension of most of these ends should produce continuous telomere elongation.
Significant resection of the elongated G-strand (so that net elongation of lagging daughter
telomeres would be small) would result in the intermediate density overhangs becoming lighter
rather than heavier as G-strand processing and C-strand fill-in took place, rather than
progressing to the fully substituted density at the end of S phase (Fig. 5B). Stochastic events
(such as oxidative damage or failure to re-establish stalled replication forks) that can produce
telomere shortening in mammalian telomeres are likely to balance the elongation of both
leading and lagging daughters so that a steady state maintenance length is achieved.
Figure 7 summarizes these observations. If all telomeres are packaged into t-loops, then they
must unfold during the passage of the replication fork, and following replication some initial
processing should occur in order for telomerase to be able to elongate the (presumably) initially
blunt leading strand daughter. Initial processing could also occur on lagging daughter
telomeres. Between 70–100% of lagging (and leading) daughter telomeric ends are then rapidly
(within 30 minutes) elongated by telomerase. C-strand fill-in that is not coordinated with
replication/telomerase action but is delayed by many hours until late in S phase. This implies
that telomeres must be in an unpackaged configuration (not in t-loops) at two very different
times: at specific times during S-phase (to permit chromosome-specific end-replication) and
again at the end of S-phase (to permit C-strand fill-in). It is currently unknown whether
telomeres refold into t-loops following replication or whether they remain linear until after CCell. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2010 August 7.

strand fill-in at late S/G2. Fill-in is incremental rather than rapid, as would be expected if it
were performed by the conventional lagging-strand replication machinery. An additional step
of end-processing must occur following fill-in that leaves the final C in the sequence 3'CCAATC-5' as the terminal C-strand nucleotide (Sfeir et al., 2005). Finally, the telomeres
would be re-folded into t-loops. This model raises multiple new steps of potential regulatory
control that may be exploited for therapeutic applications. The ability to assay telomerase
during a single cell cycle provides a powerful technique to address many of the issues raised
by these observations.

Experimental Procedures
Cell culture and Treatments
Hela cervical carcinoma, H1299 lung adenocarcinoma and A549 lung adenocarcinoma cells
were cultured at 37°C in 5% CO2 in medium containing 10% cosmic calf serum (HyClone,
Logan, UT). A clone of A549 cells with short telomeres (TRF=3.5kb) was treated with lµM
GRN163L every three days for one month before infection with retroviral pBabepurohTERT
and analysis by STELA. Telomerase activity in Hela was inhibited by the addition of 2µM
GRN163L (Geron Corp., Menlo Park, CA) for one week with two treatments at three day
intervals before DSN analysis.

Cell cycle synchronization
Exponentially growing HeLa and H1299 cells synchronized with thymidine (2 mM) for 19 hr,
washed with pre-warmed PBS (3x), then released into fresh medium for 9 hr. Thymine (2 mM)
was then added for 17 hr followed by washing with pre-warmed PBS (3x) before release into
fresh medium containing 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (BrdU, 100µM) for 0–24 hr.
BJ and A549 cells were grown in low serum medium (DMEM with 0.1% calf serum and 20mM
HEPES) for 2 days, then treated with 4µg/ml aphidicolin (overhang analysis) or hydroxyurea
(timing of Xp/Yp replication) in fresh medium containing 10% serum for 24h. Cells were the
washed 3x with pre-warmed PBS and released into fresh medium for 0–10h.
Strand-specific in situ Hybridization: Replicative Detargeting FISH (ReDFISH)

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

ReDFISH was performed as described (Zou et al., 2004). Briefly, synchronized BJ cells were
released and 10 µM BrdU / 3.3 µM 5’-bromo-2’-deoxycytidine (BrdC) was added for 1h pulses
at increasing times. Colcemid was added after 10h, metaphase spreads were prepared 1h later,
and sequentially hybridized to cy3 and cy5 labeled telomeric probes after nicking the DNA
with UV and digesting with ExoIII. The fraction of Xp/Yp ends exhibiting differential
hybridization to the two chromatid arms was then determined.
C- and G-STELA
Procedures were performed as described (Sfeir et al., 2005) with minor modifications. Briefly,
320ng EcoRI digested genomic DNA was incubated in 20µl (1× ligase buffer, 50 U T4 ligase
from NEB, 1 µM of six C-telorettes [0.16µM for each]) at RT for 12h. Multiple PCR reactions
(28 cycles of 95°C for 15 s, 62°C for 20 s, and 68°C for 10 min) used Hi-Fidelity PCR Master
Mix (2x provided by Abgene) in 25µl containing 2ng ligased DNA and 0.5µM primers
(XpYpE2 forward primer and C-Teltail reverse primer). Amplification products transferred
onto positively charged nylon membranes (Hybond N+, GE healthcare life sciences) were fixed
by baking at 85° for 2h and hybridized with a subtelomeric probe (generated by PCR using
XpYpE2 and XpYpB2 and labeled by random priming). The membrane was exposed to a
PhosphorImager screen and scanned.

For G-STELA, EcoRI digested genomic DNA was incubated with 1nM platform
oligonucleotide (AATCCC)10 at RT for 3h. The subsequent ligation and PCR amplification
followed the same conditions as above except that six G-telorettes were used for ligation and
a G-Teltail reverse primer was used for PCR.
Genomic DNA purification
Genomic DNA was isolated using the DNAeasy kit (<5M cells) or Blood&Cell culture Midi
kit (Qiagen, Valencia CA). Eluted DNA was re-precipitated by adding two volumes 100%
ethanol, washed twice with 70%ethanol and suspended in distilled water at <1 µg/µl. Overnight
incubation at 37°C ensured that all the DNA was completely solubilized.
DSN Overhang assay and CsCl gradient separation of telomeric overhangs

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The DSN assay was performed as described (Zhao et al., 2008). For the density analysis of
overhangs, typically 50µg of purified genomic DNA from cells grown in 100 µM BrdU was
digested with 2 U of DSN (Duplex Specific Nuclease, Evrogen, Russia) at 37°C for 2h.
Digestion was stopped by adding EDTA to 20mM and the sample was mixed into CsCl with
an initial density of 1.78 g/ml containing 5 mM Tris pH 8.0 and 1 mM EDTA. Samples were
centrifuged at 60,000 rpm for 20 h at 25°C in a VTI80 vertical rotor (Beckman). Fractions were
collected and analyzed for density (refractive index). Telomeric overhangs in each fraction
were detected by slot blot and hybridization to a high specific activity C-rich telomeric probe
under non-denaturing conditions. Double-stranded leading and lagging daughter telomeres
were isolated and purified from CsCl as previously described (Zhao et al., 2008).
TRF analysis
Mean telomere length was evaluated by TRF analysis. Isolated DNAs were digested with Hinf
I and Rsa I and resolved on a 0.7% agarose gel. The denatured and dried gel was hybridized
with 32P-labeled oligonucleotides [(TTAGGG)4] and exposed to a PhosphorImager screen.
The weighted mean telomere length was calculated as described previously (Ouellette et al.,
2000).

digested then spun on CsCl gradients. An intermediate density peak is seen. Synchronized
normal telomerase negative fibroblasts (BJ) released into S phase for 4h in the presence of
BrdU did not show an intermediate peak. Hela cells treated with the telomerase inhibitor
GRN163L for 7 days before synchronization and release in BrdU also lacked an intermediate
density peak (D) Aliquots of the CsCl gradient from the first panel of (C) were slot blotted

follow by hybridizing with either C-rich (left) or G-rich (right) telomeric probes. Samples were
collected from the bottom of the gradient, and loaded in two columns on each slot blot. The
positions of the thymidine and BrdU peaks are labeled. Signals above background were only
seen with the C-rich probe for the G-rich overhang sequence.

Fraction of lagging daughter telomeres extended by telomerase in one cell cycle. (A) DNA
from G1/S synchronized Hela cells released in BrdU for 4 hours was separated on CsCl
gradients. (B) Four fractions from the lagging strand peak in (A) were pooled and digested
with DSN. The resulting overhangs were then analyzed on a second CsCl gradient. The
thymidine peak represents those replicated ends that were not extended by telomerase. (C)
Deconvolution of the peaks in (B) assuming a Gaussian distribution for each overhang class.
(D) Replotting of the data in (C) after normalization for the estimated size of the extended vs
non-extended overhangs (see text). ~70% of Hela telomeres are extended each cell cycle. (E)
Telomeres from synchronized H1299 cells released for 4 hours in BrdU were separated into
unreplicated, lagging and leading fractions. (F) 100% of lagging overhangs exhibited
intermediate densities indicating extension by telomerase. (G) Overhangs from unreplicated
telomeres showed no evidence of BrdU incorporation. (H) Overhangs from leading strand
daughter telomeres were fully substituted with BrdU.
