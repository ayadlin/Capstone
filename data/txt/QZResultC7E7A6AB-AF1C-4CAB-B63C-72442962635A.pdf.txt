Abstract
Dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) is the initial and rate-limiting enzyme of the uracil catabolic
pathway, being critically important for inactivation of the commonly prescribed anti-cancer drug 5-ﬂuorouracil
(5-FU). DPD impairment leads to increased exposure to 5-FU and, in turn, increased anabolism of 5-FU to
cytotoxic nucleotides, resulting in more severe clinical adverse effects. Numerous variants within the gene coding
for DPD, DPYD, have been described, although only a few have been demonstrated to reduce DPD enzyme activity.
To identify DPYD variants that alter enzyme function, we expressed 80 protein-coding variants in an isogenic
mammalian system and measured their capacities to convert 5-FU to dihydro-ﬂuorouracil, the product of DPD
catabolism. The M166V, E828K, K861R, and P1023T variants exhibited signiﬁcantly higher enzyme activity than
wild-type DPD (120%, P ¼ 0.025; 116%, P ¼ 0.049; 130%, P ¼ 0.0077; 138%, P ¼ 0.048, respectively). Consistent with
clinical association studies of 5-FU toxicity, the D949V substitution reduced enzyme activity by 41% (P ¼ 0.0031).
Enzyme activity was also signiﬁcantly reduced for 30 additional variants, 19 of which had <25% activity. None of
those 30 variants have been previously reported to associate with 5-FU toxicity in clinical association studies,
which have been conducted primarily in populations of European ancestry. Using publicly available genotype
databases, we conﬁrmed the rarity of these variants in European populations but showed that they are detected at
appreciable frequencies in other populations. These data strongly suggest that testing for the reported deﬁcient
DPYD variations could dramatically improve predictive genetic tests for 5-FU sensitivity, especially in individuals
of non-European descent. Cancer Res; 74(9); 2545–54. 2014 AACR.

Introduction
Genetic polymorphisms in the dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) gene (DPYD) have emerged as predictive
risk alleles for developing severe toxicity to the commonly
prescribed anti-cancer drug 5-ﬂuorouracil (5-FU). Three
DPYD variants have consistently been reported to be associated with 5-FU toxicity and impaired DPD enzyme activity.
The most studied of the DPYD variants,  2A (rs3918290; also
known as IVS14þ1G>A) interrupts a splice accepter
sequence and causes the in-frame deletion of amino acids
corresponding to exon 14 (1). Carriers of  2A have signiﬁcantly reduced DPD enzyme levels, resulting in prolonged
clearance times for 5-FU (2) and, as such, are more likely to

develop adverse toxicity following treatment with the drug
(3, 4). The second well-accepted DPD deﬁciency–associated
variant, I560S (rs55886062), is exceptionally rare in the
general population but has been consistently linked to
reduced DPD activity (5) and increased incidence of 5-FU
toxicity (6, 7). Clinical studies have also consistently shown
association between a third variant, D949V, and severe
toxicity following chemotherapy that included 5-FU (4, 7).
More than 100 additional missense variants have been
reported for DPYD, many from large-scale sequencing efforts
using individuals from various racial groups (8, 9). Few of these
additional variants have been evaluated in case–control studies of 5-FU toxicity and those that have been studied have
yielded unclear or conﬂicting results. For instance, the M166V
variant was shown to strongly associate with grade III and IV
toxicity in a cohort of patients with breast, gastroesophageal,
or colorectal cancer treated with 5-FU–based therapy (10);
however, additional reports failed to conﬁrm a link between
the variant and 5-FU toxicity (4, 11). Further studies have
suggested that M166V might be protective against speciﬁc 5FU–related toxicities in women (12).
To aid in developing predictive genetic tests of 5-FU toxicity,
we determined the contributions of many of these additional
DPYD variants to DPD activity. Our laboratory previously
demonstrated the use of a recombinant system of protein

of DPYD transcript ENST00000370192 from UniProtKB/UniRef100 release 2011_12 as the reference protein sequence.
PolyPhen-2 predictions rely upon a na€ve Bayes classiﬁer
model trained using machine-learning algorithms applied to
publicly available datasets. In silico data presented in Fig. 1
were determined using the prediction model trained with the
HimDiv dataset (15). The estimated false-positive rate (FPR)
for each variant is calculated by the software as the fraction of
benign variants incorrectly classiﬁed as damaging for a given
threshold of na€ve Bayes probabilistic scores (15). Qualitative
predictors ("benign," "possibly damaging," and "probably damaging") are reported by the software based on the thresholds
determined from estimated FPR values. Complete details
regarding the algorithms and outputs of the PolyPhen-2 software have been detailed by the software's developers (15, 16).
Additional predictions were performed using PolyPhen-2
trained with the HumVar dataset, PROVEAN version 1.1.3
Mutation Assessor web server (17), SIFT version 4.0.3 (18),
and the SNAP webserver (19) using the default settings.

In silico functional prediction
A list of missense DPYD variants was compiled using the
NCBI dbSNP (14), the 1000 Genomes Project (9), and the NIH
Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Exome Sequencing
Project (ESP; ref. 8) databases. The PolyPhen-2 web server
version 2.2.2 was used to predict the impact of amino acid

expression to measure the enzyme activity of a small set of DPD
protein variants using human cells (13). We hypothesized that
additional DPYD variants may contribute to DPD deﬁciency,
especially in populations not of European ancestry that have
been under-represented in large case–control clinical association studies of 5-FU toxicity. In all, 80 DPD variants were
expressed in mammalian cells and the enzyme activity of each
variant measured. Thirteen variants (9 missense, 2 stop-gained,
1 frame-shift, and 1 in-frame insertion) had less than 12.5%
enzymatic activity and were classiﬁed as  2A-like. Six variants
had enzyme activities similar to I560S (12.5%–25%), and the
enzyme activities of 11 variants were similar to that of D949V
(>25%, but signiﬁcantly lower than wild type). Four variants
showed enzyme activities that were signiﬁcantly higher than
wild type, similar to our previous ﬁndings for C29R and S534N
(13). Consistent with our hypothesis, these newly classiﬁed
DPYD deﬁciency variants were present at higher frequencies in
non-European populations.

Screening of DPYD Variants for Altered 5-FU Catabolism

Experimental design
DPYD variants were randomly divided into groups of 6 for
functional evaluation. Each experiment consisted of a group of
6 variants tested in parallel with a positive control (wild-type
DPYD) and a negative control (exon 14 deletion mimicking the

2A transcript). Experimental groups were tested in triplicate
(technical replicates) with all 3 replicates being transfected,
processed, and assayed in parallel. The results for all 3 technical
replicates were pooled to constitute a biologic replicate. At
least 3 independent biologic replicates were performed for
each variant.
Cells
Low-passage HEK293T/c17 cells (culture CRL-11268) were
obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and
cultured as previously described (13). Aliquots of low-passage cell stocks were prepared within 2 weeks of receipt.
Cells were maintained in culture for no more than 10
passages or 2 months. Cell lines were periodically monitored
for mycoplasma by Hoechst staining (Sigma-Aldrich). Culture identity and health were monitored by microscopy.
Population doubling times were determined by cell counting
and compared with those for the original cell stock at time of
receipt.
For transfection, cells were seeded at 106 cells per well in 6well plates. After incubation for 16 hours, 70% to 80% conﬂuent
cultures were transfected with 1 mg plasmid using 3 mL XtremeGENE HP (Roche Applied Science) per manufacturer's
instructions. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were
washed with PBS, trypsinized (0.05% Trypsin and 0.53 mmol/L
EDTA; Mediatech), pelleted, and an equivalent volume of 0.1
mm diameter glass beads (Next Advance) added. Cells were
resuspended in buffer consisting of 35 mmol/L potassium
phosphate at pH 7.4 supplemented with 2.5 mmol/L MgCl2,
0.035% 2-mercaptoethanol, and Complete EDTA-free protease
inhibitor cocktail (Roche). Cells were disrupted using a Bullet
Blender Storm homogenizer (Next Advance) at 4 C. Total
protein concentration was determined for supernatants using
the BioRad Protein Assay (BioRad).
Dot blotting
Protein lysates were mixed 5:1 with reducing buffer (62.5
mmol/L Tris, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 5% 2-mercapoethanol) in a ﬁnal
volume of 50 mL and incubated at 98 C for 10 minutes. Serial
dilutions were blotted to nitrocellulose using a BioDot microﬁltration apparatus (BioRad). Membranes were blocked using
Odyssey blocking buffer (LI-COR). Blots were probed with
primary antibodies against DPD (ab54797, AbCam) and
a-tubulin (ab4074, AbCam) and subsequent secondary
IRDye800CW-conjugated goat anti-mouse (92632210, LI-COR)
and IRDye680-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibodies
(96268071, LI-COR). Blots were scanned and dot intensities
quantiﬁed using the LI-COR Odyssey Infrared Imaging system.
The background signal was determined by repeating quantiﬁcation using a larger diameter for each dot and subtracting
the original intensity value. Relative intensity was calculated as
(Sd_Int/Sd_Area)  [(Ld_Int  Sd_Int)/(Ld_Area  Sd_Area)], where
Sd_Int is the total intensity of the small dot, Sd_Area is the area of

www.aacrjournals.org

the small dot, Ld_Int is the total intensity of the large dot, and
Ld_Area is the area of the large dot.
DPD enzyme activity assay
Enzyme activity was determined using a method described
earlier by our laboratory (13). Brieﬂy, lysates were incubated
with 200 mmol/L NADPH (Sigma-Aldrich) and 8.2 mmol/L [6C14]-5-ﬂuorouracil ([6-C14]-5-FU; Moravek Biochemicals) for
30 minutes at 37 C. Conversion of [6-C14]-5-FU to [6-C14]-5dihydroﬂuorouracil ([6-C14]-5-DHFU) was determined using a
reverse-phase C18 HPLC column (Grace) connected to a
PerkinElmer Radiomatic 625TR ﬂow scintillation analyzer.
DPD activity was calculated by measuring the percent region
of interest as the area under the curve for ([6-C14]-5-DHFU)/
([6-C14]-5-FU þ [6-C14]-5-DHFU) using ProFSA software (PerkinElmer). Validation that ([6-C14]-5-FU) and NADPH were not
limiting in reactions is presented in Supplementary Fig. S1.
Calculation of enzyme activity for DPD variants
DPD enzyme activity for a given variant was normalized by
relative input amount of DPD as measured by dot blot. Data
for each biologic replicate were centered and standardized
scores (Z-scores) calculated by subtracting the mean of all
data points in the replicate from each individual data point
and dividing by the SD of all data points in the replicate.
Unpaired 2-tailed Student t tests (assuming equal variance)
were used to compare results for a given variant with the
matched positive control (wild-type). For data presentation
purposes, normalized results for each experiment were rescaled such that the mean of the negative control was equal to 0
and that of the positive control was equal to 1.
Amino acid alignment and protein modeling
Amino acid sequences for DPD were retrieved from NCBI for
human (Homo sapiens, NP_000101.2), pig (Sus scrofa,
NP_999209.1), mouse (Mus musculus, NP_740748.1), chicken
(Gallus gallus, XP_426639.3), and zebraﬁsh (Danio rerio,
NP_998058.1). Multiple sequence alignment was performed
using Clustal Omega version 1.2.0. Percent identities between
amino acid sequences were calculated using NCBI BLASTP
version 2.2.28þ. Protein modeling was performed using UCSF
Chimera version 1.8 (20) and Modeller version 9.12 (21). For
homology modeling, the human DPD protein (NP_000101.2)
was used as a query sequence and the pig crystal structure
corresponding to substrate-bound DPD with closed active
site loop (PDB ID 1GTH) was used as the template structure.
All 3-dimensional protein images were prepared using UCSF
Chimera.
Allele frequency determination
Allele frequency data were obtained from the NHLBI ESP (8)
and the 1000 Genomes Project (9) databases. The NHLBI ESP
dataset is composed of whole exome sequence data from 2,203
African American and 4,300 European American individuals.
1000 Genomes Project data were from 246 individuals of West
African ancestry (AFR), 181 of American ancestry (AMR), 286 of
East Asian ancestry (ASN), and 379 of European ancestry
(EUR). Additional details about the speciﬁc racial groups

Results
In silico prediction of DPYD variant effects
A total of 128 missense DPYD variants were compiled from
NCBI dbSNP (14), 1000 Genomes Project (9), and NHLBI ESP
(8) databases. A complete list of variants and allele frequencies
is presented in Supplementary Table S2. To ascertain which
variants were most likely to affect enzyme activity, the PolyPhen-2 software program (15) was used to predict the impact
of each amino acid substitution on the structure and function
of the DPD protein. The predicted probability that a given
variant is damaging to the protein is presented in Fig. 1A. The
estimated FPR for each variant as calculated by PolyPhen-2 is
presented in Fig. 1B. Of the 128 missense DPYD variants, 63
were predicted to be probably damaging (<5% estimated FPR),
15 possibly damaging (5%–10% estimated FPR), and 50 benign
(>10% estimated FPR). Qualitative predictions for each variant
are presented in Supplementary Table S2.

Functional study of variations
Functional studies were performed to directly measure the
enzyme activity of 75 transgenically expressed missense DPYD
variants using a mammalian system of protein production that
we described previously (13). The selected variant pool was
enriched for those that had been previously reported in clinical
case–control studies and/or case reports relating to 5-FU
toxicity or DPD deﬁciency. Thirty-seven of the selected variants were predicted to be probably damaging, 7 were predicted to be possibly damaging, and 31 were predicted to be
benign. Five additional variants (2 truncation, 1 frame-shift, 1
in-frame insertion, and 1 somatic missense mutation) were
also studied. Enzyme activity was corrected for differences in
expression as determined by quantitative dot blot (Fig. 2A and
B), which yielded comparable results to Western blotting (data
not shown). A comparative summary of DPD enzyme activities
for selected variants is presented in Fig. 2C–F; numerical values
and statistics for missense variants are also detailed in Supplementary Table S2.
Within the probably damaging group of missense variants,
19 (51%) showed signiﬁcantly decreased enzyme activity compared with wild-type DPD (Fig. 2C). Of these, 8 variants had
little to no residual enzymatic activity (<12.5%), including
K958E (P ¼ 1.3  105), S201R (P ¼ 3.0  107), V995F
(P ¼ 6.9  105), G593R (P ¼ 3.9  105), G880V (P ¼ 3.5 

R592W (P ¼ 4.0  105) and were thus classiﬁed as  2A-like
(Fig. 2C). Dramatic reductions in activity (12.5%–25% of wildtype, similar to our previous report for I560S; ref. 13)
were noted for 6 variants: R235W (P ¼ 9.2  107), Y211C
(P ¼ 0.0021), D495G (P ¼ 0.0017), R592Q (P ¼ 2.6  105),
D342N (P ¼ 1.9  106), and S492L (P ¼ 2.3  104; Fig. 2C).
D949V, which had previously not been tested using this assay,
showed signiﬁcantly decreased enzyme function compared
with wild-type (59% activity, P ¼ 0.0031; Fig. 2C). Four
additional variants had enzyme activities that were significantly lower than wild-type but greater than 25%: T760I
(P ¼ 0.0035), P92A (P ¼ 0.045), Y304H (P ¼ 0.026), and Y186C
(P ¼ 0.027; Fig. 2C). One variant, M166V, had signiﬁcantly
higher enzyme activity than wild-type DPD (120% activity,
P ¼ 0.025; Fig. 2C). The highest average activity in this group
was noted for L310S (133%); however, this result was not
signiﬁcantly different from wild-type due to high variability
(P ¼ 0.076; Fig. 2C).
Fewer variants showed signiﬁcant reductions in enzyme
activity in the possibly damaging and benign prediction
groups. Of the 7 possibly damaging variants, 2 (29%) had
signiﬁcantly impaired enzyme function (Fig. 2D). F438L
retained 47% of enzymatic activity (P ¼ 0.0042) and D687A
was 75% active (P ¼ 0.011; Fig. 2D). Of the 31 amino acid
changes predicted to not affect function, 5 (16%) had enzyme
activities signiﬁcantly lower than wild-type (Fig. 2E). R353C
completely lacked enzymatic activity (P ¼ 2.0  105; Fig. 2E).
The enzyme activities of K290E, T983I, L352V, and N893S were
45%, 73%, 77%, and 80%, respectively (P ¼ 0.0019, P ¼ 0.023, P ¼
0.0085, and P ¼ 0.018; Fig. 2E). Three variants in the predicted
benign group showed signiﬁcantly higher enzyme activities
than wild-type DPD. E828K was 16% hyperactive (P ¼ 0.049),
K861R was 30% hyperactive (P ¼ 0.0077), and P1023T was 38%
hyperactive (P ¼ 0.048; Fig. 2E).
We tested 4 additional variants that affected more than 1
amino acid. These included the truncation variants R21X
(rs72549310) and E386X (rs78060119), the P633[FS] frame-shift
variation (rs72549303), and the F100[FS] in-frame 3-nucleotide
insertion (rs72549301). In addition, G252V (NM_000101.2c.755G>T, COSM74430), a somatic missense mutation contained in the Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer
database (22, 23) that was originally identiﬁed in an ovarian
tumor specimen analyzed as part of The Cancer Genome Atlas
project (24), was also assayed. As expected, neither truncation
variant, R21X or E386X, yielded detectible enzyme activity (Fig.
2F). Protein fragments corresponding to the predicted sizes
were detectable for both variants by Western blotting using an
anti-DPD antibody; however, both were expressed at lower
levels than wild-type DPD (data not shown). Both P633[FS] and
F100[FS] also lacked detectible activity (Fig. 2F). The enzyme
activity of the somatic G252V mutation was signiﬁcantly lower
than wild-type DPD (51% activity, P ¼ 1.2  103; Fig. 2F),
suggesting that de novo tumor mutations can affect catabolism
of 5-FU within cancerous cells.
Performance of in silico prediction tools
To assess the use of in silico tools for predicting the effects of
missense DPYD variations on enzyme activity, functional pre-

dictions were compared with the actual enzyme activity results
for the DPYD variants tested (Supplementary Table S3). PolyPhen-2 trained with the HumDiv dataset showed a sensitivity
of 81% and a speciﬁcity of 53%. Tradeoffs between sensitivity
and speciﬁcity, as well as between negative predictive value
(NPV) and positive predictive value (PPV), are noted when low
conﬁdence possibly damaging predictions were treated as
benign predictions and/or the threshold used to classify variants based on enzyme activity was adjusted (Supplementary
Table S3). Overall, balanced accuracy was highest when low
conﬁdence predictions were excluded from the deleterious set
and only variants with <25% activity were considered deﬁcient.
It is notable that while these adjustments to the prediction
criteria generally increased sensitivity, speciﬁcity, and NPV, as
a consequence, PPV was reduced to 38%. Similar performance
was noted for PolyPhen-2 trained with the HumVar dataset,
and a comparison with predictions from the PROVEAN (17),
SIFT (18), and SNAP (19) software programs is also presented
(Supplemental Table S3).
Modeling the human DPD protein structure
DPD is highly conserved through vertebrates, with 93%
identity between the pig and human amino acid sequences
(Fig. 3). The crystal structure of human DPD has not been
solved; however, the structure of pig DPD has been reported
(25). To identify structural elements that may be disrupted
in dysfunctional DPD variants, we generated a theoretical
homology model of human DPD using the crystal structure
of pig DPD with NADPH and 5-iodouracil as a template. The
predicted human structure contained 47 alpha helices and
31 beta sheets (Fig. 3). Of the 27 variants with reduced
enzyme activity (Fig. 2C–F), 14 were located in predicted
secondary structural elements (Fig. 3). Eleven deﬁcient
variants were located in alpha helical domains (Y186C,
S201R, D342N, L352V, R353C, S492L, D495G, G880V,
N893S, K958E, and V995F) and 3 deﬁcient variants were in
beta sheets (Y304H, R592Q, and R592W).
Location of deﬁcient variants on the DPD structure
The DPD monomer consists of 5 distinct structural domains,
each of which contains a subset of the prosthetic groups and
cofactors necessary for enzyme function (26). Domain I contains 2 iron–sulfur (Fe-S) clusters (residues 27–172). The P92A
variant was shown to be located at a conserved residue
adjacent to the Fe–S coordinating cysteine at position 91 (Fig.
3) and constituted the only deleterious variant located in this
domain. Domain II (residues 173–286 and 442–524) and
domain III (residues 287–441) are closely intertwined and bind
FAD and NADPH, respectively (Fig. 4B). Thirteen of 29 variations tested in the combined domains II and III signiﬁcantly
impaired enzyme function. R235W disrupts a residue important for FAD binding (Fig. 3). D342N and F438L are both
located within NADPH coordinating regions (Figs. 3 and 4B).
Domain IV contains the uracil-binding site and consists of
residues 525–847 (Fig. 4C). G674D is located within the
active loop structure, and D687A is located adjacent to the
loop (Fig. 3). In all, 4 of 18 variants tested in this region had
signiﬁcantly reduced activity. Domain V (residues 1–26 and

Seven of 16 variants in this region were deﬁcient. Notably,
K958E, H978R, and V995F are all located within Fe-S cluster
coordinating domains (Fig. 3).
Allele frequencies of deﬁcient alleles
Allele frequencies for deﬁcient variants were obtained from
the NHLBI ESP (8) and the 1000 Genomes Project (9) databases
and are summarized in Fig. 5 (full data are presented in
Supplementary Table S2). Within the NHLBI ESP dataset, the
allele frequencies for the 5-FU toxicity-associated DPYD variants  2A, I560S, and D949V were 0.09%, 0.00%, and 0.09%,
respectively, in African American individuals. Collectively,
variants showing less than 12.5% enzyme activity (denoted as

2A-like) had an allele frequency of 0.43% in the African

American population. The additive allele frequencies for
I560S-like and D949V-like variants were 0.02% and 2.22%,
respectively, suggesting that the newly classiﬁed variants may
be signiﬁcant contributors to DPD deﬁciency in African Americans. Within the European American cohort of the NHLBI ESP
dataset, the additive allele frequency of newly classiﬁed deﬁcient variants was 0.08%, whereas the frequency of  2A, I560S,
and D949V was 0.58%, 0.06%, and 0.54%, respectively.
While the 1000 Genomes Project database has information
from fewer individuals than the NHLBI ESP dataset, it contains
genotyping information from additional racial groups. Within
the AFR 1000 Genomes population, the addition of newly
classiﬁed variants increases the cumulative allele frequency
of deleterious variants to 2.64%, up from 0.41% when only  2A,
I560S, and D949V were considered (Fig. 5). The allele frequency

of deleterious variants in the AMR population doubled from
0.28% to 0.56% when newly classiﬁed variants were added.  2A,
I560S, or D949V were not detected in the ASN population;
however, the allele frequencies of newly classiﬁed  2A-like and
D949V-like variants were 0.17% and 0.52%, respectively. Finally,
it was noted that the EUR population did not carry any of the
newly identiﬁed deﬁcient DPYD variants.

Discussion
A total of 128 missense variants have been reported within
the DPYD gene, which alter 119 (12%) of the 1,025 amino acids
that comprise DPD (in 9 instances, variations affect the same
codon). Relatively few of these variants have been evaluated in
the clinical context and far fewer have been directly studied
using functional tests. Three DPYD variants ( 2A, I560S, and
D949V) are generally considered to be deﬁciency-associated
alleles, whereas many of the remaining variants have been
dismissed as being too low penetrance to be of pharmacologic
importance. Contrary to this opinion, our results indicate that
rare DPYD variants that perturb function of the translated DPD
protein are collectively present at sufﬁciently high frequencies
in non-European populations to be considered as candidate
risk alleles for developing severe adverse toxicity to 5-FU–
based treatments.
The extensively studied  2A, I560S, and D949V variants are
most likely to be detected in individuals of European ancestry
but are far less penetrant in other racial groups (Fig. 5). Using a
system of in vitro DPD enzyme activity measurement, we
systematically classiﬁed 80 reported variations in DPYD that
alter the amino acid sequence of the encoded protein. We show
that the enzyme activity of D949V is signiﬁcantly impaired but
not to the extent observed previously for  2A or I560S (13).
Thirty of the additional variants tested in the present study
were shown to be deﬁcient; 19 of which were severely deﬁcient

2552

with enzyme activities similar to those of  2A or I560S (<25% of
wild type; Fig. 3). On the basis of publicly available allele
frequency data, these deﬁcient variants are expected to be
exceedingly rare or nonexistent in European populations but
are collectively carried by an appreciable fraction of nonEuropean individuals (Fig. 5). For instance, the cumulative
allele frequency for  2A, I560S, and D949V in the ESP African
American population was less than 0.2%. In contrast, the
cumulative allele frequency of the newly classiﬁed deﬁcient
variants was approximately 2.7% in that population. In addition, within the ASN population of the 1000 Genomes Project,
no individuals carried  2A, I560S, or D949V; however, newly
classiﬁed deﬁcient variants had an additive allele frequency of
0.7% (Fig. 5). While the population sizes for racial groups in the
1000 Genomes Project are relatively small, these ﬁndings
suggest that the newly classiﬁed deﬁcient variants may
account for a signiﬁcant fraction of DPD deﬁciency, particularly in individuals with non-European ancestry. Additional
studies to ascertain the allele frequencies of DPYD variants in
other under-represented populations are underway in our
laboratory.
Recently, we examined the enzyme activity of common
DPYD variants, C29R, I543V, S534N, and V732I (13). None of
these variants showed decreased enzymatic activity relative to
wild-type DPD. Surprisingly although, C29R and S534N showed
increased 5-FU catabolism, establishing a new class of hyperactive DPYD variations. In the present study, 4 additional
variants had signiﬁcantly higher enzyme activity than wildtype: M166V, E828K, K861R, and P1023T. M166V was initially
reported in 2 individuals with partial DPD deﬁciencies, one of
whom also carried D949V (27). A subsequent study of M166V in
an extended family containing DPD deﬁciency showed that the
variant did not contribute to the disorder (6). One clinical
case–control study with a limited number of patients suggested that M166V may contribute to 5-FU–related toxicities in
gastroesophageal and breast cancers, but not in colorectal
cancer (10). Three additional clinical association studies failed
to establish any link between M166V and 5-FU–related toxicities (4, 11, 28). A fourth study suggested that M166V may
protect against hematologic toxicity and neutropenia following administration of 5-FU; however, the association was
observed only in women (12). The P1023T variant is rare in
European populations and is more common in individuals of
African ancestry (Supplementary Table S2). The hyperactive
phenotype of P1023T is supported by a previous study from our
laboratory in which individuals carrying P1023T, but not the
deﬁciency allele Y186C, had 22% higher DPD activity than those
that did not carry P1023T (5). To our knowledge, the hyperactive variants E828K and K861R have not been reported in any
clinical or case studies.
Numerous case reports support our ﬁndings for many of
the variants classiﬁed as deﬁcient in this study. In early
studies of severe DPD deﬁciency in children with delayed
motor skills development, van Kuilenburg and colleagues
identiﬁed H978R (29) and subsequently S201R, Y211C, and
S492L (30) as potential contributors to DPD deﬁciency. The
truncation variant E386X was reported in a DPD-deﬁcient
Japanese individual (31), and R592W was detected in a

Screening of DPYD Variants for Altered 5-FU Catabolism

Korean individual who experienced grade IV toxicity after
receiving 5-FU (32). R21X was detected in an individual also
carrying  2A who experienced severe toxicity and died 21
days following 5-FU treatment (33). R235W and the frameshift variant P633[FS] were detected in a compound heterozygous state in a severely DPD-deﬁcient individual (34).
V995F was likewise reported in an individual with DPD
deﬁciency (35).
In a previous report, we showed that in a cohort of healthy
African American individuals, DPD enzyme activity in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from Y186C carriers was
46% lower than that in non-carriers (P ¼ 2.9  104), suggesting that the amino acid change impaired the catalytic activity
of the enzyme (5). In the present article, we observed that DPD
containing the Y186C amino acid substitution was reduced by
approximately 15% relative to wild-type. This reduction is less
than we expected based on the data from healthy volunteers
but is similar to a previously reported study focused on this
variant (36). We hypothesized that Y186C may affect dimerization, as the residue is located on the monomer surface, and
previous reports have suggested that tyrosine to cysteine
substitutions could cause aberrant dimer crosslinking (37).
Multiple additional missense variants have been detected in
individuals carrying Y186C (5); the potential implication of coexpressed DPYD variants to overall DPD activity needs further
clariﬁcation.
To date, predictive tests of 5-FU toxicity have had limited
value, as carriers of known DPD deﬁciency–associated alleles
( 2A, I560S, and D949V) constitute a relatively small percentage of toxicity cases (38). In a previous study, we conﬁrmed that

2A and I560S were deleterious DPYD variants with dramatically impaired DPD enzyme activity (13). In the present study,
we conﬁrmed D949V as a deleterious variant and presented
comparative data showing that at least 30 additional DPYD
variants impair DPD function. Some of these variants have
been documented in case reports; however, the rarity of these

alleles has prevented the determination of their statistical
signiﬁcance as predictive markers of 5-FU toxicity. The results
presented in this article should address that gap and provide
guidance for the individualization of 5-FU therapy for carriers
of rare, damaging DPYD variants. Our ﬁndings also highlight
the importance of performing genetic analyses that are unbiased by previous studies conducted in populations of limited
diversity.
