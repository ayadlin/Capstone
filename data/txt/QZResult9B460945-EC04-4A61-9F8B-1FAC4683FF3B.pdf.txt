Abstract
Patients with hormone-refractory prostate cancer (HRPC)
have an estimated median survival of only 10 months because
of acquired drug resistance, urging the need to develop therapies against the drug-resistant HRPC phenotype. Accumulating evidence suggests that overexpressing antiapoptotic Bcl-2
family proteins is at least partially responsible for the development of drug resistance among HRPC patients. Antagonizing the antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins, therefore, is one
potential approach to circumventing drug resistance in HRPC.
WL-276 was developed as a small-molecule antagonist against
antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins, with binding potency
comparable to ( )-gossypol. Overexpressing Bcl-2 or Bcl-XL
failed to confer resistance to WL-276. WL-276 also effectively
induced apoptosis in PC-3 cells. In addition, three PC-3 cell
lines with acquired drug resistance against standard cancer
chemotherapies were more sensitive to WL-276 than the
parent PC-3 cell line. The increased cytotoxicity toward drugresistant PC-3 cells shows the clinical potential of WL-276
against HRPC that is resistant to conventional therapies. The
anticancer activity of WL-276 was manifested in its suppression of PC-3–induced prostate tumor growth in vivo. The
selective toxicity of WL-276 against drug-resistant PC-3 cells
and its in vivo suppression of PC-3 prostate tumor growth
suggest that WL-276 is a promising lead candidate for the
development of Bcl-2 antagonists against drug-resistant
HRPC. [Cancer Res 2008;68(11):4377–83]

Introduction
Prostate cancer is the most common malignancy and the second
leading cause of cancer-related deaths among males in the United
States with about 218,890 new cases and 27,050 deaths expected for
2007 (1). Whereas treatment for localized therapy can be highly
effective, current treatments for metastatic prostate cancer are
temporizing as the disease following initial remission in response
to androgen ablation relapses to a hormone-refractory phenotype [hormone-refractory prostate cancer (HRPC)], a generally fatal
form of prostate cancer (2). Currently, the best treatment against
HRPC is docetaxel-based chemotherapy with an overall survival
improvement by f6 months. A major challenge to docetaxel-based
chemotherapy for HRPC patients is the development of resistance,
leading to the failure of treatment and patient death (3, 4). There-

fore, there is an urgent need to search for approaches that control
drug-resistant HRPC.
Drug-resistant HRPC is often genetically associated with the
overexpression of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins, the key
regulatory proteins in prohibiting apoptosis (4–9). Thus, antagonizing the antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins is one promising
strategy to treat drug-resistant HRPC. This is supported by the
recent clinical trial results of oblimersen sodium (an antisense
against Bcl-2 protein; refs. 10–12). Small-molecule antagonists
against antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins are also under intense
investigation (13–19). ( )-Gossypol, for example, has been shown
to enhance the response of PC-3 tumors to radiation therapy via
inhibition of Bcl-XL (20). However, it remains to be determined
whether any of these are effective against drug-resistant HRPC.
Furthermore, none of these small molecules, as a single agent, have
shown effective in vivo anticancer activity against HRPC.
WL-276 is a small-molecule antagonist against antiapoptotic
Bcl-2 family proteins developed in our laboratory based on BH3I-1
(15). In this study, we showed that WL-276 had similar inhibitory
activity against Bcl-2 protein and enhanced activity against Bcl-XL
protein compared with ( )-gossypol (21). WL-276 effectively
induced apoptosis in PC-3 cells at low micromolar concentrations.
Overexpression of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins failed to induce
resistance to WL-276 in vitro. More excitingly, WL-276 showed
enhanced toxicity against drug-resistant PC-3 cells. As a single
agent, WL-276 effectively suppressed PC-3 cell–induced prostate
cancer growth in vivo with no observable toxicity. WL-276 was
metabolically stable as well. These studies, as detailed below, show
the promise of developing WL-276–based Bcl-2 antagonists for the
treatment of HRPC, especially the drug-resistant HRPC.

Materials and Methods
WL-276 syntheses. All commercial reagents and anhydrous solvents
were purchased from vendors and used without further purification. Analytic TLC was done on EM Science silica gel 60 F254 (0.25 mm). Compounds
were visualized by UV light or stained with p-anisaldehyde, potassium
permanganate, or cerium molybdate solutions, followed by heating. Flash
column chromatography was done on Fisher Scientific silica gel (230–400
mesh). Melting points were determined on a Thomas-Hoover Unimelt
melting point apparatus 6406-K. 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)
spectra were recorded on a Varian 300 MHz spectrometer and calibrated
using an internal reference. Electrospray ionization mode mass spectra were
recorded on a BrukerBioTOF II mass spectrometer. WL-276 was synthesized in our laboratory by the following procedures (Fig. 1). Briefly,
NaOH (0.8 g, 200 mmol) was added to a suspension of L-phenylalanine
(1.65 g, 100 mmol) in water (150 mL). The mixture was stirred to complete
dissolution. Carbon disulfide (0.6 mL) was then added and the mixture
was stirred vigorously overnight. Aqueous solution of ClCH2CO2Na (100 mL,
1 mol/L) was added and the mixture was stirred at room temperature
for 8 h. Hydrochloric acid solution (5.5 mol/L) was then added to adjust
the pH of the solution to pH 2–3, followed by refluxing the solution
overnight. The reaction mixture was neutralized by saturated NaHCO3

solution. Solvent was removed under reduced pressure and the residue was
purified by silica gel chromatography eluting with 30% ethyl acetate in hexanes
and 0.2% HOAc to give a cyclized product (1; 1.282 g, 45%). The solution
of 1 (980 mg, 3.487 mmol) in dry toluene (70 mL) was mixed with
4-biphenylcarboxaldehyde (952 mg, 5.231 mmol) and NH4OAc (537 mg,
6.794 mmol) followed by refluxing for 16 h. Solvent was removed under
reduced pressure. The residue was purified by silica gel chromatography
eluting with 0% to 30% ethyl acetate in hexanes plus 0.2% HOAc to give a
condensed product (2; 1.413 g, 90%). The solution of 2 (445 mg, 1 mmol) in
dichloromethane (60 mL) was treated with p-tolunenesulfonamide (188 mg,
1.1 mmol), N-ethyl-N¶-(dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide (229 mg, 1.2 mmol),
and 4-dimethylaminopyridine (61 mg, 0.5 mmol) and stirred at room
temperature overnight. Solvent was removed under reduced pressure. The
residue was purified by silica gel chromatography eluting with 0% to 15% ethyl
acetate in hexanes plus 0.2% HOAc to give the desired product WL-276 as

Binding of WL-276 with recombinant Bcl-2 or Bcl-XL protein. The
binding interactions of WL-276 with recombinant Bcl-2 or Bcl-XL protein
were evaluated based on its competition against a Bak BH3 domain peptide
following an established procedure (22). Briefly, recombinant Bcl-2 protein
(1 Amol/L) or Bcl-XL protein (130 nmol/L) was incubated with Flu-Bak
peptide (10 nmol/L) for 1 h at room temperature to form the proteinpeptide complex. Such a complex was then mixed with varying concentrations of WL-276. Fluorescence polarization of the solution was
determined using a Tecan GENios Pro multiwell plate reader (Tecan US).
The binding of WL-276 to the recombinant proteins would release Flu-Bak
peptide from the protein-peptide complex, resulting in a decrease of
fluorescence polarization. Controls included dose-response measurements
in the absence of proteins to assess for any interactions between WL-276
and Flu-Bak peptide with such effects taken into account by subtraction.
Inhibitory constant (K i) was determined by fitting fluorescence polarization
values to the concentrations of the small molecule using a single-site
competition model in GraphPad (22).
Cell culturing. Jurkat cells overexpressing either Bcl-2 or Bcl-XL were
kindly provided by Dr. Claus Belka (University of Tuebingen, Tuebingen,
Germany) and Dr. Daniel Johnson (University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh,
Pennsylvania), respectively, and characterized before (22). Jurkat cells and
various PC-3 prostate cancer cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 with 10%
fetal bovine serum (v/v), 100 units/mL penicillin G, 100 Ag/mL streptomycin, and 5% CO2 at 37jC.

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (11). June 1, 2008

Cell viability analyses. Jurkat cells (1  104 per well) were plated in a
96-well plate. PC-3 cancer cells (3,000 per well) were plated in a 96-well
plate. The cells were treated with either a vehicle control or various
concentrations of WL-276 for 24 h. At the end of each treatment, cell
viability in each well was measured by using CellTiter Blue Cell Viability
Assay kit (Promega) and normalized to the vehicle-treated control.
DNA fragmentation. DNA fragmentation was assessed with Apoptotic
DNA Ladder Extraction Kit (Biovision). Briefly, PC-3 cells were treated with
WL-276 for 6 h. Cells (2.0  106) were harvested and washed with PBS. The
cells were suspended in DNA Ladder Extraction Buffer (50 AL). After
incubation at 23jC for 10 s with gentle pipetting, the mixture was
centrifuged for 5 min at 1,600  g. The supernatant was transferred to a
fresh tube and the cell pellet was extracted again with DNA Ladder
Extraction Buffer (50 AL). The supernatants were combined and Enzyme A
solution (5 AL) was added into the supernatant. The solution was mixed by
gentle vortex and incubated at 37jC for 10 min. Enzyme B solution (5 AL)
was then added into the mixture and further incubated overnight at 50jC.
Ammonium acetate solution from Biovision (5 AL) was added to the sample
and mixed well. Isopropanol (100 AL) was added and the solution was
mixed well and kept at 20jC for 20 min. DNA pellet was obtained by
centrifugation at 13,000  g for 10 min. The pellet was washed twice with
ice-cold 75% ethanol, dried, and resuspended in DNA Suspension Buffer
(20 AL). Samples were loaded onto a 1.2% agarose gel containing 0.5 Ag/mL
ethidium bromide in both gel and running buffer. Electrophoresis was run
at 50 V for 1 h. DNA was visualized with UV light and photographed.
Caspase-3/-7 activity. Apo-ONE Homogeneous Caspase-3/-7 Assay Kit
(Promega) was used to measure caspase-3/-7 activity according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, after 24 h of WL-276 treatment, the cell
culture medium was removed and fresh RPMI cell culture medium (50 AL)
with Apo-ONE Caspase-3/-7 reagent (50 AL) was added to each well.
The solution was mixed gently and incubated at 37jC for 45 min. The
fluorescence intensity of each well was measured with excitation at 485 nm
and emission at 530 nm. Caspase-3/-7 activity was normalized to the vehicletreated control.
Cytochrome c release. Fractionation of PC-3 cells into mitochondrial
and cytosolic fractions was done at 4jC following established procedures
(23, 24). Briefly, 24 h after WL-276 treatment, PC-3 cells (20  106) were
trypsinized and collected. The pellets were resuspended in fractionation
buffer A (0.3 mL, 1 mmol/L HEPES-KOH, 0.1 mmol/L EDTA, 1 mmol/L
EGTA, 250 mmol/L sucrose, pH 7.4) supplemented with protease inhibitor
cocktail from Sigma. Cell disruption was done by passing the cells through a
23-gauge needle 20 times. The lysate was centrifuged at 800  g for 10 min
at 4jC to remove nuclei and unbroken cells. The supernatant was
centrifuged at 10,000  g for 10 min at 4jC to pellet the mitochondrial
fraction and the supernatant was the cytosolic fraction. Cytosolic lysates

containing 40 Ag of protein were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred onto a
nitrocellulose membrane, blocked, and probed with cytochrome c primary
antibody (Santa Cruz, Inc.). Bound antibodies were detected with
appropriate peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody followed by detection
using the SuperSignal chemiluminescence system (Pierce).
Animals. Male athymic BALB/c nude mice obtained from Frederick
Cancer Research Facility (National Cancer Institute, Frederick, MD) were
maintained in a laminar airflow cabinet under pathogen-free conditions
and used at 8 to 12 wk of age. All facilities were approved by the American
Association for Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care in accordance with
the current regulations and standards of U.S. Department of Agriculture,
U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, and NIH.
Xenograft tumor growth and WL-276 treatment. Cultured PC3-LN4 cells
(60–70% confluent) were prepared for injection as previously described (25).
Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane. Viable tumor cells (2  106 in 0.2-mL
PBS) were implanted s.c. into the flank. Formation of a bulla indicated a
satisfactory injection. Beginning on day 3 after injection, groups of mice
(16 mice per group) were then treated with i.p. saline, 50 mg/kg WL-276,
or 100 mg/kg WL-276 for 12 d. Tumor size, volume, and mouse body weight
were assessed every 2 d. Mice were subjected to necropsy 24 h after the last
WL-276 treatment. Tumors were removed and weighed. The tumors were
quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen for Western blot analyses. At the time of
sacrifice, the serum from each animal was collected for WL-276 quantification.
Induction of apoptosis in vivo. Frozen tumor tissues were pulverized
using a mortar and pestle on dry ice. The pulverized tissue (weighing 1.2 g)
was suspended in lysis buffer [100 AL, 15 mmol/L MgCl2, 50 mmol/L HEPES
(pH 7.4), 150 mmol/L NaCl, 8 mol/L urea, 0.1% Triton] and a cocktail of
protease inhibitors, sonicated for 1 min, and centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for
20 min. Recovered supernatants were frozen at 80jC. Twenty micrograms
of protein obtained from prostate tumor tissue homogenates were
separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane,
blocked, and probed with poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) primary
antibody (Cell Signaling). Bound antibodies were detected with appropriate
peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody followed by detection with the
SuperSignal chemiluminescence system (Pierce).
Analyses of WL-276 in serum. On sacrifice, serum of each mouse was
collected and stored at 80jC until use. The serum level of WL-276 was
determined by recovering WL-276 from the serum and quantifying the
recovered WL-276 through high-performance liquid chromatography
(HPLC) at 395 nm with 4-phenylphenol as the internal standard. Briefly,
serum (200 AL) and a mixture of methanol and acetonitrile (1:1, v/v; 600 AL)
were vortexed for 10 s. The suspension was centrifuged at 14,000  g for
10 min. The supernatant was recovered, 500 AL of which were mixed with a
solution of 4-phenylphenol (100 Amol/L, 500 AL, H2O/methanol/acetonitrile
2:1:1). The solution was then analyzed by HPLC. HPLC analysis was done on
a Beckman Coulter System Gold 126 solvent module with 168 detector. A
Phenomenex Polar RP column (5 Am, 250  4.6 mm) was used for the
analyses. The flow rate used was 0.6 mL/min. The mobile phase A was water
with 0.1% acetic acid whereas B was acetonitrile with 0.1% acetic acid.
The time program used for analyses was 40% A (0–5 min), 60% to 95% B
(5–20 min), 95% B (20–25 min), and 5% to 40% A (25–27 min).

Statistical analysis. Most of the biological experiments, including the
binding assays, cell viability assays, caspase-3/-7 assays, and HPLC quantification of serum concentrations of WL-276, were done at least twice
with triplicates in each experiment. For DNA fragmentation, Western blot
analyses, and in vivo xenograft tumor growth, at least two independent
assays were done. Representative results are depicted in this report. Data
were analyzed using Prism (GraphPad Software). Student’s t test was
applied for comparison between groups using Prism. Differences were
considered statistically significant at P V 0.05.

Results
WL-276 disrupts the binding interaction of Bak BH3 domain
peptide with antiapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins. Based on our recent
structure-activity relationship studies of BH3I-1 (21), we synthesized WL-276 as a putative antagonist against antiapoptotic Bcl-2
proteins (Fig. 1). We then examined its ability to disrupt the
binding interaction of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins with a Bak BH3
domain peptide (Fig. 2). ( )-Gossypol was used for comparison
because it is the only small-molecule Bcl-2 antagonist with in vivo
activity against HRPC (20) and one of the most potent antagonists
reported to date. Compared with ( )-gossypol (K i = 10.1 Amol/L for
Bcl-2 and K i = 24.7 Amol/L for Bcl-XL; ref. 21), WL-276 had similar
potency (K i = 22.8 Amol/L for Bcl-2 and K i = 1.2 Amol/L for Bcl-XL).
In fact, WL-276 had increased inhibitory activity against Bcl-XL
protein than ( )-gossypol (20-fold improvement). Of note, the
ex vitro inhibitory activities of ( )-gossypol against antiapoptotic
Bcl-2 family proteins evaluated under our conditions are f30 to
50 times lower than those reported before (14). The discrepancy
of the ex vitro inhibitory activities of ( )-gossypol is likely due
to the differences among the recombinant Bcl-2 proteins and the
competitive peptides used in the assay systems (14, 21). Although
the inhibitory activities of WL-276 are not in the nanomolar
concentration range as the other reported small molecules (14, 18,
19, 26), it is comparable to those of ( )-gossypol.
WL-276 induces apoptosis in PC-3 cancer cells. As an
antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family protein antagonist, we envision that
WL-276 would be a potential candidate to treat HRPC. We
therefore evaluated the in vitro cytotoxicity of WL-276 against PC-3
cell lines and explored its ability to induce apoptosis. The IC50 of
WL-276 was in the low micromolar concentration (13.6 Amol/L;
Fig. 3A), about two times less potent than the reported activity
for ( )-gossypol (20). The relatively weak cytotoxicity of WL-276
compared with ( )-gossypol is likely due to the shorter drug
treatment period used in our assay: our drug treatment was 2 days
whereas that for ( )-gossypol was 5 to 7 days (20). The growth
inhibition induced by WL-276 was attributable to apoptotic cell
death, as evidenced by caspase-3/-7 activation, DNA fragmentation,

Figure 2. WL-276 inhibits the binding of a Bak BH3
domain peptide to Bcl-2 or Bcl-XL protein. Analysis
was carried out as described in Materials and
Methods. In brief, Bcl-2 or Bcl-XL recombinant protein
was first mixed with a fluorescein-labeled Bak BH3
domain peptide to form a protein-peptide complex,
which resulted in fluorescence polarization (FP )
increase. On the addition of WL-276, fluorescence
polarization was measured, which reflects the amount
of remaining protein-peptide complex.

and cytochrome c release in PC-3 cells by WL-276 in a dosedependent manner (Fig. 3B–D).
WL-276 overcomes drug resistance in vitro. Because overexpressing antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins is one mechanism
for malignancies to acquire resistance to cancer therapies, we

explored whether WL-276, as an antagonist against antiapoptotic
Bcl-2 family proteins, may nullify such drug resistance. To test this
hypothesis, two sets of Jurkat cells stably transfected with either
Bcl-2 or Bcl-XL were acquired and characterized as detailed before
(22). They showed extensive resistance to anticancer agents with

IC50s for Taxol and Fas ligand were not obtained because these two agents are cytostatic with the concentration range tested.

varying mechanisms of action, including Taxol, doxorubicin,
thioguanine, cisplatin, and Fas ligand (Fig. 4A–E). When these
sets of Jurkat cells were evaluated against WL-276, they both
showed the same sensitivity as the parent Jurkat cells (Fig. 4F),
showing that overexpressing antiapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins was not
effective in inducing resistance to WL-276.
We next explored whether WL-276 could overcome drug
resistance in prostate cancer cells induced through prolonged
sublethal drug exposure, which mimics the natural development of
drug resistance. To test this, we developed three sets of drugresistant PC-3 cell lines by culturing parent PC-3 cell line in the
presence of sublethal dosage of cisplatin, doxorubicin, or Taxol for
at least 6 months. Such PC-3 cell lines all developed resistance to
the corresponding agents (Fig. 5A). Excitingly, all of the three drugresistant PC-3 cell lines showed increased sensitivity to WL-276
compared with the parent PC-3 cell line (Fig. 5B), indicating that
WL-276 would be an effective and selective anticancer agent
against drug-resistant prostate malignancies.
WL-276 suppresses PC-3–induced prostate tumor growth in
mouse xenograft. To examine the therapeutic potential of WL-276
as a single agent against HRPC malignancy, we assessed the in vivo
effect of daily i.p. administration of WL-276 at two different doses,
50 and 100 mg/kg, on the growth of PC-3 xenograft tumors
(Fig. 6A). All animals tolerated the treatments well with no
observable signs of toxicity. Increase in body weight occurred at a
slight slower rate in the 100 mg/kg group. However, there was no
weight loss during the course of the study and the difference in
growth rate was not statistically significant (Fig. 6B). No gross
pathologic abnormalities were noted at necropsy as well (data not
shown). WL-276 treatments at both dosages displayed a significant
inhibitory effect of tumor size (P < 0.05) compared with the control
group. In fact, WL-276 at the dose of 100 mg/kg induced near
complete inhibition of tumor growth. Even at the dose of 50 mg/kg,

WL-276 inhibited tumor growth to f30% of the tumor volume in
the control group.
WL-276 induces apoptosis in prostate tumors. We next
explored whether WL-276 suppressed prostate tumor growth
in vivo through the induction of apoptosis by evaluating the
cleavage of PARP, a well-known marker of apoptosis (27). WL-276
treatment at both dosages decreased the relative amount of
full-length PARP (Fig. 6C), indicating the cleavage of PARP and
the induction of apoptosis in tumor tissues treated with WL-276.
The relative enhancement of apoptosis in the tumor tissues seemed
to correlate with the reduction of tumor mass, supporting the
notion that WL-276 suppresses prostate tumor development
induced by PC-3 cells through the induction of apoptosis in cancer cells.
WL-276 is stable in vivo and likely the active species to
suppress tumor growth. To determine whether WL-276 is the
bioactive species in vivo for the observed anticancer activity or
the activity may derive from WL-276 metabolites, we evaluated
the stability of WL-276 in vivo and quantified the serum level of
WL-276. We first examined the stability of WL-276 in serum. Briefly,
authentic WL-276 was dissolved in serum collected from the
control mice. The mixture was incubated at 37jC for varying
periods of time followed by the recovery of WL-276 through
extraction; its quantity and purity were analyzed by HPLC. As
intermediates for WL-276 synthesis (Fig. 1), 1 and 2 were
hypothesized as potential metabolites and therefore were analyzed.
Based on HPLC profiles, no peaks other than WL-276 were
detected, including 1 and 2 (Supplementary data). In addition,
quantitative recovery of WL-276 was achieved, suggesting that WL276 was stable in serum.
We then quantified the serum level of WL-276 from the mice
treated with the two dosages of WL-276 by following the procedure
above (Fig. 6D). WL-276 at 0.27 Amol/L was detected in the serum

Figure 6. Effect of i.p. WL-276 at 50 and 100 mg/kg
on the growth of PC-3 tumors in nude mice. Each
mouse was inoculated s.c. in the right flank with
2  106 PC3-LN4 cells suspended in 0.2-mL PBS.
Seventy-two hours later, mice were randomized into
three groups (n = 8) and were given daily WL-276
at 50 and 100 mg/kg body weight per day with i.p.

of the mice treated with a dose of 50 mg/kg, and 0.34 Amol/L
WL-276 was detected at a dose of 100 mg/kg. No additional peaks
were detected in the serum from mice treated with WL-276
compared with that of mice treated with saline control (representative HPLC trace in Supplementary data), indicating that
there were no detectable metabolites generated from WL-276
in vivo. Because of the absence of metabolites of WL-276 in vivo
and the different abundance of WL-276 in serum between the
two groups of treated mice, tumor suppression is likely induced by
WL-276.

Discussion
Current chemotherapeutic strategies for HRPC, a fatal form of
prostate cancer, are not very effective because HRPC rapidly
develops resistance to chemotherapy. Because overexpressing
antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins is one mechanism for HRPC
to develop such resistance, small-molecule antagonist against
antiapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins may be an effective treatment against
drug-resistant HRPC.
Here, we identified WL-276, a small-molecule antagonist against
antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins, as a lead candidate to treat
drug-resistant HRPC. First, compared with ( )-gossypol, a Bcl-2
antagonist with shown chemosensitizing activity against HRPC
in vivo, WL-276 exhibited improved potency against Bcl-XL protein
(20-fold increase in potency) and moderately decreased potency
against Bcl-2 protein (2-fold decrease in potency). Second, WL-276
effectively suppressed PC-3 tumor cell growth through the
induction of apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. Third, WL276 nullified drug resistance induced through the overexpression of
antiapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins. More importantly, drug-resistant PC-3
cell lines showed increased sensitivity to WL-276 compared with
the parent PC-3 cell line. Although the levels of antiapoptotic Bcl-2
proteins between the drug-resistant PC-3 cell lines and the parent
PC-3 cell line showed no detectable differences (data not shown),
the relative balance of proapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins and antiapop-

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (11). June 1, 2008

totic Bcl-2 protein may vary among these cell lines, which may
account for the selective cytotoxicty of WL-276 against the drugresistant ones. The ability to eradicate Bcl-2 protein–induced drug
resistance and to selectively eliminate drug-resistant PC-3 cancer
cell lines strongly argue for the anticancer potential of WL-276
against drug-resistant HRPC. Fourth and most importantly, as a
single agent, WL-276 effectively suppressed PC-3 tumor growth
in vivo with near complete suppression at the dose of 100 mg/kg
daily. Even at 50 mg/kg, WL-276 reduced tumor volume to f30%
of the control. Mechanistically, WL-276 suppressed tumor growth
in vivo through the induction of apoptosis, consistent with its
antagonism against antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins. Lastly,
WL-276 is metabolically stable in vivo, suggesting that the anticancer activity observed in vivo is likely due to WL-276 antagonism
against antiapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins. Given its low micromolar
activity against Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL proteins, it is possible that WL-276
may interact with cellular targets other than antiapoptotic Bcl-2
family proteins as well.
Considering the pivotal function of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins
in tumorigenesis, drug resistance, and metastasis of HRPC, and
the selective toxicity of WL-276 against drug-resistant PC-3 cells,
WL-276 represents a promising candidate for the development
of selective therapies against drug-resistant HRPC. Further development of this candidate for the treatment of HRPC is currently
under way.
