BACKGROUND: Alemtuzumab is highly effective at treating chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) in bone marrow,
which is the usual site of residual disease after fludarabine-based treatment. Eliminating residual disease potentially
is associated with longer remission and overall survival. The authors of this report evaluated the ability of subcutaneous alemtuzumab to treat residual disease. METHODS: Patients in partial remission (PR), nodular PR (nPR), or complete remission (CR) who had disease in bone marrow established by 2-color flow cytometry analysis were enrolled
and received alemtuzumab 30 mg subcutaneously 3 times weekly for 4 weeks, and patients had the option to selfadminister alemtuzumab. Responders were patients in PR who converted to an nPR or a CR, patients in nPR who
converted to a CR, and patients in CR who had no evidence of disease on 2-color flow cytometry analysis after treatment. RESULTS: There were 31 patients enrolled, of whom 29 were evaluable, and there were 23 responders (4 of
4 patients who achieved a CR, 8 of 9 patients who achieved an nPR, and 11 of 16 patients who achieved a PR. Nonresponders had significantly lower plasma alemtuzumab levels at the end of treatment. Furthermore, higher plasma
alemtuzumab levels at the end of treatment were correlated with a longer response duration. Compared with the
results from an historic group that received intravenous alemtuzumab for residual disease, there was a trend toward
a higher response rate but a shorter response duration with subcutaneous alemtuzumab. CONCLUSIONS: The current
results demonstrated that self-administered, subcutaneous alemtuzumab was safe and active for residual disease
and that plasma alemtuzumab levels and real-time minimal residual disease evaluation are important endpoints to

Patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) who achieve complete remission (CR) or nodular partial remission (nPR) according to 1996 National Cancer Institute Working Group (NCI-WG) criteria have longer remission duration and survival than patients who achieve partial remission (PR) or who fail to respond to treatment.1,2 Molecular
analysis for the immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable (IGHV) gene and 4-color flow cytometry analysis are more sensitive
than morphologic evaluation of the bone marrow used to establish CR according to 1996 NCI-WG criteria. A study by
Moreton et al3 of alemtuzumab administered to previously treated patients with CLL demonstrated that those who
achieved minimal residual disease (MRD)-free status according to 4-color flow cytometry analysis had longer survival.
This suggested that evaluating for MDR-free status could add to response evaluation.
Studies in fludarabine-refractory, previously treated, and treatment-naive patients with CLL clearly demonstrated
the efficacy of intravenous alemtuzumab.3–5 Subcutaneous alemtuzumab is effective in fludarabine-refractory patients and

Alemtuzumab SC for Residual Disease/Wierda et al

as initial treatment for patients with CLL.6,7 Previously,
we reported results from a clinical trial evaluating the efficacy of alemtuzumab intravenously 3 times weekly for 4
to 8 weeks in eliminating residual disease after treatment
with chemotherapy or chemoimmunotherapy.8 That
study demonstrated an overall response rate (ORR) of
46% in 41 patients; the median response duration was not
reached at a median follow-up of 18 months.
Here, we report the results with subcutaneous alemtuzumab for residual disease and include a retrospective evaluation of bone marrow for MRD by 4-color flow cytometry
analysis and end-of-treatment plasma alemtuzumab levels.
Furthermore, we compare outcomes between the subcutaneous alemtuzumab group and an updated historic group
of 58 patients who received intravenous alemtuzumab.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
This was a multicenter, phase 2 clinical trial conducted
by the CLL Research Consortium. Patients were enrolled
from March 2005 to May 2007, including 16 patients at
The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center,
11 patients at University of California-San Diego, and 4
patients at Dana Farber Cancer Institute. All respective
institutional review boards approved the protocol and
the informed consent form. All participants provided
informed consent according to institutional guidelines.
Patients with CLL/small lymphocytic leukemia were
aged >18 years, had a performance status between 0 and
2, had adequate liver and kidney function (creatinine,
total bilirubin, and aspartate and alanine aminotransferase levels all 2 times the upper limit of normal), and
achieved CR, nPR, or PR according to 1996 NCI-WG
criteria with their most recent treatment. Patients in CR
were required to have a residual population of cluster of
differentiation 5 (CD5)-positive/CD19-positive cells
that comprised 10% of the bone marrow mononuclear
population or CD5-positive/CD19-positive cells that
comprised <10% of the bone marrow mononuclear
population with a kappa/lambda ratio of >6 or <0.33,
respectively. Patients were excluded for active infection,
history of anaphylaxis with rodent-derived monoclonal
antibodies, prior treatment with alemtuzumab, pregnancy, corticosteroids, and uncontrolled autoimmune
hemolytic anemia. Patients could not have received
treatment for CLL within 2 months of enrollment; there
was no upper limit for the time from last chemotherapy.
The trial intended to enroll 25 patients in nPR or PR
and 25 patients in CR. Accrual was completed to the nPR/
PR group, but the CR group was very slow to accrue and,
Cancer

as a result, was closed. The current analysis includes 26
patients who were enrolled in the nPR/PR group and 5
patients who were enrolled in the CR group. Patients were
registered in the CLL Research Consortium database, and
all data were collected through the web-based clinical database system. Upon enrollment, patients underwent complete history and physical examination, pretreatment
laboratory evaluation (including blood chemistries and
blood count), and bone marrow aspirate and biopsy. Some
patients had prognostic factors evaluated, including IGHV
mutation status9 and leukemia cell expression of f chainassociated protein kinase 70 (ZAP-70)9 and CD38 (in respective clinical laboratories), by flow cytometry.
Treatment
Treatment consisted of single-agent, subcutaneous alemtuzumab at doses of 3 mg, 10 mg, and 30 mg on Days 1,
2, and 3, respectively, followed by 30 mg subcutaneously
3 times weekly for a total of 12 doses, including the initial
dose escalation. The research nurses with previously prepared educational materials taught patients self-administration. Once patients demonstrated self-administration
to the staff, this was continued for the duration of treatment. Dosing, injection site, and toxicities were documented by patients with diaries, which were submitted for
review and documentation at the end of treatment. Premedications consisted of 25 mg to 50 mg diphenhydramine and 650 mg oral acetaminophen. In addition,
trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole twice daily, 3 times
weekly, or he equivalent for Pneumocystis jiroveci prophylaxis and valacyclovir 500 mg daily or valganciclovir 450
mg twice daily for viral prophylaxis were given for the duration of treatment and for a minimum of 3 months after
completing alemtuzumab. Responses to treatment were
assessed within 4 weeks of the end of treatment, and
patients could receive a second 4-week course if residual
disease was documented at their first response assessment.
Response Assessment and Follow-Up
Criteria for response were as follows8: Patients who enrolled
in CR were considered responders if they had no disease
detected on 2-color flow cytometry bone marrow analyses
after treatment; specifically, 2-color flow cytometry bone
marrow analysis could not demonstrate any kappa:lambda
skewing (3:1 or 1:3) regardless of the proportion of cells
that coexpressed CD5 and CD19. For patients who
enrolled in nPR, responders must have achieved CR
according to 1996 NCI-WG criteria. For patients who
enrolled in PR, responders must have achieved either nPR

or CR according to 1996 NCI-WG criteria. For patients
who received 2 courses of alemtuzumab, response was
assessed after the second course. Patients had a physician
visit at least every 3 months after response assessment and
underwent bone marrow aspirate and biopsy at least every 6
months to evaluate for loss of response. Time to loss of
response and survival were dated from study enrollment.
Loss of response was defined for patients who enrolled in
CR as the loss of 2-color flow cytometry response in bone
marrow, or developing nodules, or 30% lymphocytes in
bone marrow, or lymphadenopathy, or hepatosplenomegaly; for patients who enrolled in nPR, loss of response was
defined as redeveloping criteria for nPR or for PR; and, for
patients who enrolled in PR, loss of response was defined as
redeveloping criteria for PR.
Plasma Alemtuzumab Levels and 4-Color
Flow Cytometry
Plasma alemtuzumab levels were assessed retrospectively
at the end of treatment using the flow cytometry-based
method developed by Rebello and Hale.10 Bone marrow

118

samples that were cryopreserved at response assessment
were evaluated retrospectively for MRD by standardized
4-color flow cytometry11 (Genzyme Corporation,
Cambridge, Mass). Patients also were evaluated for
antialemtuzumab antibodies (BioAnalab Limited, Oxford
Science Park, United Kingdom), and none were positive
after treatment (data not shown).
Historic Intravenous Alemtuzumab
Comparison Group
We previously conducted a trial of intravenous alemtuzumab for residual disease that enrolled 41 patients.8 The
trial was revised to enroll an additional 17 patients among
CLL Research Consortium clinical sites. We updated
follow-up of all 58 patients to include response duration
and survival (Table 1). This group was used as an historic
intravenous alemtuzumab comparison group.

The distribution of time to loss of response and survival were estimated with the Kaplan-Meier method.12
Kaplan-Meier curves for categorical variables were plotted

included.

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics and Treatment
There were 31 patients enrolled who received subcutaneous alemtuzumab, including 17 patients in PR, 9 patients
in nPR, and 5 patients in CR (Table 1). The median age
was 65 years (range, 48-84 years), the median number of
previous treatments was 1 (range, 1-6 previous treatments), and the time from last treatment to alemtuzumab
was 7.6 months (range, 2-45 months). All patients who
had previously received a fludarabine-based regimen were
at least 4 months from treatment (data not shown).

alemtuzumab course (Table 3). There was 1 death (a
patient in PR) that occurred within 1 month of the last
alemtuzumab dose because of refractory autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA), and 1 patient was lost to followup (a patient in CR); neither patient could be evaluated
for response, and both were included in the denominator
for ORR. All 4 evaluable patients who enrolled in CR
were responders to subcutaneous alemtuzumab according
to specified criteria (Table 4). Eight of 9 patients who
enrolled in nPR and 11 of 17 patients who enrolled in PR
responded to subcutaneous alemtuzumab treatment.
Four-color flow cytometry analysis was performed retrospectively on cryopreserved bone marrow samples that were
obtained at response assessment for 22 of the evaluable
patients (Table 4). Two of 4 patients who enrolled in CR
had post-treatment bone marrow MRD evaluations, and neither was MRD-negative at end of treatment. Twenty-nine
percent of 7 patients who enrolled in nPR and 18% of 13
patients who enrolled in PR were MRD-negative according
to 4-color flow cytometry analysis at response assessment.
Alemtuzumab therapy was highly effective at eliminating morphologic evidence of residual disease from
blood and bone marrow and was less effective at treating
residual lymphadenopathy (Fig. 1). The median plasma

study, all with progressive, refractory CLL.
Safety and Toxicity
The majority of treatment-related adverse events were
grade 1 or 2 (Table 6). Patients were able to self-administer alemtuzumab without complication or difficulties, as
documented by their diaries. Injection site reactions
(grade 1 or 2), consisting of erythema, pruritus, and induration that typically lasted 2 or 3 days with complete resolution, were reported by 24 patients (most were grade 1).
Four patients experienced serious infections associated
with neutropenia; 2 patients developed pneumonia, 1
patient developed gram-positive bacteremia, and 1 patient
developed fever of unknown origin. All serious infections
occurred within 2 months of completing alemtuzumab
and were not associated with plasma alemtuzumab levels
greater than the median (6 lg/mL) at the end of treatment. Two patients developed symptomatic cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation that required ganciclovir
treatment, and 1 patient developed a fever and was treated
empirically for presumed CMV reactivation. Hematologic toxicities consisted of neutropenia, which was grade
3 in 19% of patients and grade 4 in 19% of patients.
Grade 3 anemia was noted in 3% of patients, and no grade
3 thrombocytopenia was observed. These hematologic
toxicities were attributed to treatment with alemtuzumab

and were not associated with increased end-of-treatment
plasma alemtuzumab levels (Table 6).
There were 4 serious adverse events, all of which
occurred at the end of alemtuzumab treatment or within 1
month of completion. One patient developed uncontrolled hemolytic anemia during treatment and died
(Table 6), as mentioned above. One patient developed
neutropenic fever and was admitted to the hospital; blood
cultures grew Staphylococcus hominis, and the infection
was treated and resolved. One patient was admitted and
treated with empiric antibiotics for neutropenic fever.
Radiographs revealed no source of infection, and cultures
remained negative; the fever resolved with antibiotics
(Table 6). The same patient experienced a second event of
pneumonia with an infiltrate observed on a chest x-ray in
the setting of neutropenia that was treated and resolved.
There were no reported late infections or infection-related
deaths.
Comparison of Subcutaneous Versus
Intravenous Alemtuzumab
Response and response duration, as defined for the subcutaneous population, for 58 patients who received intravenous alemtuzumab for residual disease was updated
(Table 1).8 The characteristics of this group were similar
to those of the 31 patients who received subcutaneous
alemtuzumab with the after noted differences: The intravenous group received fewer courses of alemtuzumab, was
younger, had lower platelet count, and had higher b-2
microglobulin levels at enrollment (Table 1). The proportion of patients with lymphadenopathy before alemtuzumab was similar between the groups (Table 1). Among
the patients who had lymphadenopathy, 60% of those in
the subcutaneous group and 52% of those in the intravenous group had more than 1 involved lymph node site.
Furthermore, the largest lymph node measured 2 cm in
50% of those in the subcutaneous group and in 31% of
those in the intravenous group. The ORR using the same
criteria was lower (P ¼ .07) for the patients who received
intravenous alemtuzumab (Table 1). However, among
the responders, the proportion of patients who had
MRD-negative bone marrow status was significantly
higher (P ¼ .005) in the intravenous group, although the
method used to evaluate MRD differed between trials; 4color flow cytometry analysis was used in the subcutaneous trial, and a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based
assay for the clonal IGHV gene was used in the intravenous trial. There was a trend (P ¼ .07) for shorter
response duration, when using the same criteria for both

122

trials, for patients who received subcutaneous alemtuzumab versus intravenous alemtuzumab (median response
duration, 13 months vs 31 months, respectively) (Fig. 3B).
There was no difference in overall survival between the
trials at the most recent follow-up (data not shown).

DISCUSSION
Investigators have evaluated strategies to achieve MRDfree status by incorporating alemtuzumab into the
approach with the expectation that this may translate into
longer remission duration and survival.8,14–16 The phase
3 trial of the German CLL Study Group clearly demonstrated longer progression-free survival for patients
who received alemtuzumab.14,16 That trial demonstrated
a high response rate of 74%, although the response duration was disappointing. There was an apparently shorter
response duration with subcutaneous alemtuzumab compared with the that reported in the historic intravenous
trial. The characteristics of the patients were similar in our
historic comparison group, making it less likely that the
shorter response duration was caused by differences in
patient characteristics. The shorter response may have
been caused by the reduced ability of subcutaneous
alemtuzumab to clear MRD when given for the defined
treatment period. In both trials, patients received a 4week course of alemtuzumab (12 doses) with the option
for a second 4-week course for patients who had residual
CLL after the first course. Fewer patients received a
second course of alemtuzumab on the intravenous trial.
Also, the proportion of responders who were negative for
MRD was lower for patients who received subcutaneous
alemtuzumab versus intravenous alemtuzumab. One difficulty in interpreting this observation is that the methods
for evaluating MRD were different between trials. For the
subcutaneous trial, 4-color flow cytometry was used to
evaluate MRD, which potentially has different sensitivity
than the PCR-based assay that was used to evaluate
patients in the intravenous trial. Also, these trials were not
contemporaneous but sequential; therefore, unappreciated trial effects may account in part for the differences in
response duration between the patient populations.
A major concern for the use of alemtuzumab in
residual disease is infection, including CMV reactivation
and opportunistic infections.14,17 The German CLL
Study Group had to terminate their phase 3 trial, and
Cancer and Leukemia Group B terminated their phase 2
trial of alemtuzumab for MRD, both because of unacceptable, infection-related toxicity. One possible explanation

for this observation was a shorter duration between the
completion of chemotherapy and the initiation of alemtuzumab. Nevertheless, the current study demonstrated that
alemtuzumab can be self-administered safely by patients
with residual disease, with the expected reactivation of
CMV in a minority of patients. The incidence of symptomatic CMV reactivation on this trial was lower than previously reported, likely because some patients received
valganciclovir for CMV prophylaxis. Reactivation of
CMV can be minimized, if not eliminated, with prophylactic valganciclovir.18 It is possible that trials of
alemtuzumab for residual disease that reported serious
and, in some cases, fatal infectious complications were
the result of allowing too little time for immune reconstitution between fludarabine-based chemotherapy and the
initiation of alemtuzumab. In our previous trial of 58
patients who received intravenous alemtuzumab and in
the current trial with 31 patients who received subcutaneous alemtuzumab for residual disease, there was no
treatment-related, infectious mortality. The median time
from fludarabine-based therapy to alemtuzumab was >6
months, and we recommend waiting at least 4 to 6
months before initiating alemtuzumab to minimize infectious complications.
To our knowledge, this is the first trial to report the
self-administration of subcutaneous alemtuzumab.
Patients were taught to self-administer alemtuzumab and
were able to complete the treatment without complication
or incident. Subcutaneous alemtuzumab was associated
with local injection-site reactions, but these were mild and
were minimized by supportive measures, such as applying ice before and after the injection and administering
acetaminophen and diphenhydramine premedication.
In the current trial, plasma alemtuzumab levels were
correlated with response and response duration. There are
limited reports of single-agent alemtuzumab pharmacokinetics. It is noteworthy that Hale et al19 evaluated the
pharmacokinetics of alemtuzumab in 30 patients with
recurrent disease who received intravenous alemtuzumab
and in 20 untreated patients who received subcutaneous
alemtuzumab. Their analysis indicated significant interpatient variability in pharmacokinetic parameters; however, the mean cumulative dose of alemtuzumab that was
needed to reach a trough serum concentration of 1 lg/mL
was 90 mg for the intravenous group and was substantially
higher at 551 mg for the subcutaneous group. Furthermore, higher trough serum alemtuzumab concentrations
were correlated significantly with a better clinical response
and with achieving MRD-free status. Montillo et al15

evaluated pharmacokinetics in 16 patients who received
alemtuzumab 10 mg subcutaneously 3 times weekly for 6
weeks as treatment for residual disease. Their data indicated that patients who achieved an area under the receiver
operating characteristic curve on Day 15 of therapy that
was >5 lghour/mL were more likely to achieve CR compared with individuals who had lower levels. In our study,
patients who did not achieve a response had lower plasma
levels of alemtuzumab at the end of treatment compared
with responders. Furthermore, among the responders,
those with end-of-treatment alemtuzumab levels lower
than the median of 6 lg/mL had significantly shorter
response duration than patients who had levels higher
than the median. Given the significantly higher cumulative dose of subcutaneous alemtuzumab needed to achieve
blood concentrations associated with response, we
hypothesize that optimized treatment and improved
safety and responses, specifically MRD-free status, could
be achieved better by evaluating for MRD in a real-time
fashion and administering individualized alemtuzumab
subcutaneously or intravenously based on blood levels.
Because blood reveals only 1 disease compartment, a time
factor to allow for compartment equilibration is yet
another consideration.
Further work to optimize this treatment strategy
may make use of a new trial design in which patients
have blood alemtuzumab levels measured and undergo
real-time evaluations for MRD. Patients could begin with
a 4-week course (12 doses of 30 mg) of subcutaneous
alemtuzumab followed by evaluations of response, MRD,
and blood drug levels. For patients with residual disease,
treatment could continue, and the subcutaneous alemtuzumab dose or schedule could be adjusted, depending on
blood drug levels; then, treatment would continue with
monthly bone marrow evaluations either until patients
achieved negative MRD status or a predetermined total
duration of treatment is reached for patients who remain
positive with potentially adequate blood alemtuzumab
levels. This remains an interesting, active, and promising
therapeutic strategy for patients with CLL. Continued use
of this strategy should be undertaken only in the setting of
a well designed, controlled clinical trial.
