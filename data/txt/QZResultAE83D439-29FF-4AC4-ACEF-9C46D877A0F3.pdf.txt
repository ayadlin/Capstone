BACKGROUND: Metabolic imaging is of interest in esophageal cancer; however, the usefulness of initial standardized
uptake value (SUV) in positron emission tomography (PET) is unknown in patients with esophageal or gastroesophageal carcinoma treated with definitive chemoradiotherapy. The authors hypothesized that initial SUV would correlate
with patient outcome. METHODS: The authors retrospectively analyzed esophageal or gastroesophageal carcinoma
patients who had baseline PET and endoscopic ultrasonography in addition to other routine staging. All patients
received definitive chemoradiotherapy. Multiple statistical methods were used. RESULTS: The authors analyzed 209
consecutive esophageal or gastroesophageal carcinoma patients treated with definitive chemoradiation for outcome;
of these, 180 had baseline PET for additional analyses. The median overall survival (OS) for all patients was 20.7
months (95% confidence interval, 18.8-26.3). Patients with clinical complete response (CR) lived longer than those
with less than clinical CR (P < .0001). The median initial SUV was 12.7 (range, 0-51). Higher initial SUV was associated
with longer tumors (P ¼ .0001), higher T-stage status (P < .0001), positive N-stage status (P ¼ .0001), higher overall
stage (P < .0001), lack of clinical CR (P ¼ .0002), and squamous cell histology (P < .0001). In the univariate analysis,
initial SUV was associated with OS (Cox model, P ¼ .016; log-rank test, P ¼ .002). In the multivariate analysis, initial
SUV dichotomized by the median value (P ¼ .024) and tumor grade (P ¼ .016) proved to be independent OS prognosticators. Median initial SUV for clinical CR patients was 10.2, compared with 15.3 for less than clinical CR patients
(P ¼ .0058). CONCLUSIONS: The data indicate that a higher initial SUV is associated with poorer OS in patients with
esophageal or gastroesophageal carcinoma receiving definitive chemoradiation. Upon validation, baseline PET may
become a useful stratification factor in randomized trials and for individualizing therapy. Cancer 2011;117:4823–33.

adenocarcinoma has been increasing on a consistent basis
for >30 years in the Western countries.2,3 Obesity, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and Barrett metaplasia are
associated with the rapid increase in the incidence of
esophageal or gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma.4 Surgery
is still a commonly recommended primary therapy; however, prognosis after resection is poor.5 In North America,
the use of preoperative chemoradiotherapy (trimodality
therapy) is common and preferred over preoperative
chemotherapy to improve patients’ prognosis.6,7 This
approach has been substantiated by the positive results
reported in a recent trial that is the largest in its class.8
Definitive chemoradiotherapy (bimodality therapy)
has also been established as an important approach for
patients with locally advanced esophageal carcinoma.9
Bimodality therapy is appropriate for patients who do not
want surgery or in whom surgery is not possible for technical or medical reasons. Recent studies have reported
that in those patients with high thoracic squamous cell
carcinoma, bimodality therapy might be a preferred
option.10,11
Heterogeneity in patient’s outcome is frequently
noted even if similarly staged patients receive the same therapy. This heterogeneity in patient outcome could be related
to differing molecular biology of individual esophageal cancer responsible for various levels of sensitivity to chemotherapy and radiotherapy and its metastatic potential.12
The challenge is to identify patients who can benefit from a
specific therapy and also identify those who will not benefit. Some advances have been made in metabolic imaging
through positron emission tomography (PET).13-23
Interesting results have been reported with initial
standardized uptake value (SUV) and its correlation with
overall survival (OS) in surgically managed esophageal or
gastroesophageal carcinoma patients who did not receive
any preoperative therapy. Lower initial SUV was associated with longer OS.24,25 In patients who received trimodality therapy, initial SUV did not correlate with
OS.13,26,27 In 1 of our studies,19 higher initial SUV
tended to be associated with improved OS in patients
who received trimodality therapy. The association
between initial SUV and prognosis of patients treated
with bimodality therapy has not been reported.
In this paper, we report our retrospective experience
in patients with esophageal or gastroesophageal carcinoma
treated with bimodality therapy. We hypothesized that
initial SUV would correlate with outcome of bimodality
patients. We also reviewed the importance of clinical
complete response (CR) after chemoradiation.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Selection
We studied 209 consecutive patients with biopsy-proven
esophageal or gastroesophageal carcinoma who were treated
with bimodality therapy between 2002 and early 2008. Initial SUV was available for analysis in 180 patients. Bimodality therapy was recommended based on the evaluation of
patient’s cancer staging and other appropriate evaluations by
the multidisciplinary team, which included medical oncologists, gastroenterologists, radiation oncologists, pathologist,
radiologists, and thoracic oncologic surgeons. There were
some patients who were recommended trimodality therapy
but did not want surgery (reasons are given below).
Pretreatment investigations included a complete
blood count, measurement of serum electrolytes, chest radiograph, computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest
and abdomen, barium swallow radiography, upper gastroesophageal endoscopy with endoscopic ultrasound, and
PET (when feasible).
Study Design
Our objective was to perform 2 analyses: 1) to assess the
effectiveness of the bimodality therapy at our institution
in consecutive patients (n ¼ 209); and 2) to correlate initial SUV (n ¼ 179) with clinical parameters, including
OS and relapse-free survival (RFS).
Definitive Chemoradiotherapy
(Bimodality Therapy)
All patients received concurrent chemotherapy with radiotherapy. Before definitive chemoradiotherapy, 84 (40.2%)
patients received up to 8 weeks of induction chemotherapy.
The total radiation dose delivered was either 45 grays (Gy)
in 25 fractions or 50.4 Gy in 28 fractions, at 1.8 Gy per
fraction delivered once per day, 5 days per week. All
patients received a fluoropyrimidine (intravenous or oral)
and either a taxane or a platinum compound as the second
cytotoxic agent during radiation. Five to 6 weeks after the
completion of chemoradiation, all patients underwent
comprehensive restaging that included complete blood
count, measurement of serum electrolytes, upper gastroesophageal endoscopy with biopsies, and imaging studies
of the chest and abdomen including PET.
SUV Calculations
The maximum SUV was calculated with the following
equation: SUV ¼ A/(ID/BW), in which A is the decay-corrected mean activity in tissue (measured in millicuries per
milliliter), ID is the injected dose of fluorodeoxyglucose

(FDG) (measured in millicuries), and BW is the patient’s
body weight (measured in grams). At our institution, we
follow the National Cancer Institute guidelines for image
preparation, acquisition, and analysis.28
Imaging
PET-CT in 180 patients was performed before any therapy as a baseline study in all patients. PET-CT images
were acquired with an integrated PET-CT device (Discovery ST-8; GE Medical Systems, Milwaukee, Wis), and
the whole-body mode was implemented as the standard
software. Before PET-CT, patients fasted for at least 6
hours. All patients were tested to confirm that their glucose
level was within the normal range (80-120 mg/dL) before
FDG administration. Before PET, unenhanced CT was
performed from the base of the skull to the upper thigh
according to a standardized protocol performed with the
following settings: transverse 3.75 mm section thickness,
140 kV peak, 120 mA, and 13.5 mm table speed. Emission
scans were obtained 60 minutes after the intravenous
administration of FDG (15-20 mCi or 555-740 MBq).
The acquisition time was 3 minutes per bed position in the
2-dimensional mode. Images were reconstructed with
attenuation-weighted ordered-subset expectation maximization with and without attenuation correction. These have
been described in detail elsewhere.19-22

emission tomography (PET) portion of the PET-computed tomography (CT) examination is shown. (Right) Lower thoracic
esophageal cancer with FDG uptake on a PET portion of the
PET-CT examination is indicative of esophagitis after chemoradiation (because postchemoradiation biopsy was negative,
this patient was classified as having achieved a clinical complete response).

Assessments After Chemoradiation
Upon completion of all postchemoradiation staging, each
patient was assigned to 1 of 2 categories: 1) clinical complete response (clinical CR) or 2) less than clinical CR.
Clinical CR was defined as having no cancer cells in the
postchemoradiation biopsy in all patients. This was
coupled with having a physiologic level of SUVmax on
postchemoradiation PET (Fig. 1) or when SUVmax was
higher than normal but was distributed in the esophagitis
pattern (Fig. 2). This is a working definition at our institution, and we acknowledge that there is no agreed upon
standard definition for clinical CR.
Follow-Up and Survival
Patients were followed periodically until 5 years or until
death. Follow-up data were obtained from The University
of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center tumor registry and
the hospital records or social security database.
Statistical Methods
Continuous variables were summarized using descriptive
statistics such as mean, standard deviation, median, and
range. Categorical variables were tabulated by frequency
and percentage.

Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate the
probability of OS and RFS; log-rank test, and Cox proportional hazards regression analysis were used to determine the association of OS and RFS with clinical and
demographic parameters, including initial SUV values.
Multivariate analysis was applied to determine the association of initial SUV with OS after adjusting the effects of
other covariates. First a base Cox proportional hazards
model for OS was established. To build the base model,
initially a full model was fitted, including all variables
with P value <.15 in the univariate analysis. Then a backward selection procedure was used to remove 1 variable at
a time, until all variables retained in the model were at the
.05 significance level. After that, a model including initial
SUV and variables in the base model was fit to evaluate
the prognostic effect of initial SUV or its changes on OS
after adjusting the effects of the covariates in the base
model. Initial SUV was dichotomized based the median
value for assessment, but we also performed the recursive
partitioning and regression tree analyses29 for OS and
RFS to identify an optimum cutpoint for initial SUV.
Fisher exact test and Wilcoxon rank sum test were
used to compare the patient characteristics.

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
Characteristics of the 209 patients who received definitive
chemoradiotherapy (without surgery) are shown in Table 1.
White men and adenocarcinoma histology dominated.
Among these 209 patients, 73 (34.9%) had significant
comorbid conditions, 69 (33.0%) patients had technically
unresectable tumor, and 45 (21.5%) patients elected not
to undergo surgery (but were recommended surgery).
During chemoradiotherapy, 24 (11.5%) patients had
severe adverse events, and they were considered too highrisk (estimated mortality >10%) for surgery.
Survival and Relapse (n 5 209)
The median follow-up time was 38.1 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 30-43.1). The estimated median survival time for all 209 patients was 20.7 months (95% CI,
18.8-26.3), and median RFS time was 11.15 months
(95% CI, 9.44-14.34). The estimated OS and RFS rates
at 3 years were 35.7% (95% CI, 29.0%-43.9%) and
24.8% (95% CI, 19.1%-32.1%), respectively.
After definitive chemoradiotherapy, 130 (62.2%)
patients had a clinical CR. The median OS of patients
with clinical CR was 37.47 months (95% CI, 27.14 to

CR was 12.6 months (95% CI, 12.27-23.78); this difference was highly significant (P < .0001; Fig. 3). Similarly,
RFS for patients with clinical CR was 20.07 months
(95% CI, 15.48-36.94), compared with 4.84 months
(95% CI, 4.54-5.49); this difference was highly significant (P < .0001; Fig. 4).
Cancer recurrence or persist cancer was documented
in 151 (72.2%) of 209 patients. In addition, 125 (59.8%)
patients had died at the time of this analysis.

continuous variables. The results suggested that higher
initial SUV was associated a higher chance of death (hazard ratio [HR], 1.02; P ¼ .016). In Table 3, the log-rank

whether the patients had clinical CR (P < .0001). Location of the primary tumor,30 tumor histology, induction
chemotherapy, and type of cytotoxic agents administered
were not associated with OS.
Table 4 shows the multivariate analysis using dichotomized initial SUV (by the median as the cutoff); after
adjusting for the effect of lymph node status and tumor
grade, initial SUV was significantly associated with OS (P ¼
.024), and the grade of the tumor was also an independent
prognosticator (P ¼ .016). Patients with a higher initial
SUV (12.7) had a higher risk of death (HR, 1.61; P ¼
.024). Patients with lower than the median value of SUV
had a longer OS (Fig. 5; P ¼ .002) and improved RFS (Fig.
6, P < .001) compared with those with a higher initial SUV.
Table 5 lists the results of Wilcoxon rank sum test
for continuous variables, and Table 6 summarizes the

Fisher exact test result to compare categorical patient characteristics between the initial SUV low and high groups.
Wilcoxon rank sum test indicated that longer tumors
were associated with higher initial SUV (P ¼ .0001).
Fisher exact test indicated that initial SUV was significantly associated with primary site (P < .0001), T-stage
status (P < .0001), N-stage status (P ¼ .0001), overall
stage (P < .0001), and tumor histology (P < .0001). For
example, 80.5% of squamous cell carcinoma patients had
initial SUV 12.7, whereas only 40.9% of adenocarcinoma patients had initial SUV 12.7.
Recursive Partitioning and Regression
Tree Analysis (Initial SUV)
Recursive partitioning and regression tree analyses were
carried out to find the optimal cutpoint for initial SUV.
We identified a cutpoint of 6, and when this cutpoint was
used to dichotomize the initial SUV results, it correlated
similarly to the median cutpoint for OS (P < .0001;
Fig. 7) and RFS (P < .0001; Fig. 8). The cutpoint of 6
was also an independent prognosticator in the multivariate analysis for OS (P ¼ .0013) and RFS (P ¼ .007).
Approximately, 20% of patients had an initial SUV <6.
Patients who achieved a clinical CR had a median
initial SUV of 10.2 (range, 0-43.8); in comparison, those
with less than clinical CR had a median initial SUV of
15.3 (range, 0-51). This difference was statistically significant (P ¼ .0058).

DISCUSSION
Patients who receive bimodality therapy usually have the
following features: 1) unresectable tumor because of unresectable T4 stage or distribution or size of the enlarged
nodes, 2) severe comorbid conditions resulting in prohibitive risk of death from surgery, and/or 3) patient’s personal choice to decline surgery. In 209 patients treated at
our institution, 164 (77.8%) patients had inoperable conditions, and 45 (21.5%) patients could undergo surgery

extremely poor. Imaging with PET has shown some
promise but has not been applied to baseline PET. We
elected to study the value of baseline PET and also combine postchemoradiation PET results with postchemoradiation biopsy to determine whether the subgroups can
emerge.
Our data indicate that pretreatment PET scan
results correlate with OS and RFS. FDG PET is an assessment of glucose consumption by various normal and
abnormal tissues. The well-known Warburg effect suggests that most tumors are hypermetabolic and switch
from oxidative to glucose metabolism as the main substrate for energy even in the presence of oxygen. The FDG
PET has several shortcomings, but most importantly it is
not a direct measure of cell proliferation.33,34 Energy produced by glycolysis creates an acidic microenvironment. It
has been proposed that increased extracellular acid production may be the underlying basis for cancer cell survival and progression in the context of the 6 hallmarks of
cancer: self-sufficiency in growth signals, insensitivity to
antigrowth signals, evasion of apoptosis, limitless replicative potential, sustained angiogenesis, and tissue invasion
and metastasis.35 For these reasons, initial SUV measured
by PET may be associated with aggressive clinical behavior and shorter OS.
This is the first study in bimodality patients to demonstrate that initial SUV is an independent prognostic
variable for OS in multivariate analysis. Patients with low
initial SUV had better prognosis than those with high initial SUV. In 1998, Fukunaga et al reported 48 Japanese

SUV is associated with poor prognosis in patients treated
with surgery alone. Those 2 studies also suggest, in conjunction with this report, that when single modality (such
as surgery) or bimodality (definitive chemoradiation) is
used, high initial SUV leads to poor patient outcome and
most likely reflects aggressive tumor behavior. In contrast,
we previously observed that in 161 patients who received
trimodality therapy, high initial SUV was associated with
prolonged OS.19 A clear explanation for these intriguing
and contradictory observations is lacking, but we speculate that surgery plays an important role after chemoradiation and overcomes the adverse influence of high initial
SUV as a manifestation of tumors’ aggressive behavior.
Additional investigations are clearly warranted and should
include prospective strategies.
In this report, we analyzed clinical staging after chemoradiation and its influence of patient outcome. We were
interested in assessing critical determinants (postchemoradiation PET results and postchemoradiation endoscopic
biopsies) that seem to segregate patients into a good or a
poor prognostic group. In addition, we analyzed the influence of initial SUV (n ¼ 179) to assess if it alone can be correlated with clinical CR or lack of it. Our findings suggest
that initial SUVmax value (by either median value as the cutpoint or identified optimal cutpoint) correlates significantly
with the achievement of clinical CR, OS, and RFS. We also
found that the combination of postchemoradiation PET
and endoscopic biopsy is useful in separating clinical CR
patients from less than clinical CR patients, and the OS
rates of these 2 groups are dramatically different. This observation may be of considerable value in patients who decline
surgery but have high initial SUV and achieve less than clin-

ical CR after chemoradiation; these variables can be discussed with patients to further persuade them to undergo
surgery. Our data can form a basis for developing novel
therapeutic strategies for patients who have chemoradiation-resistant (less than clinical CR) tumors.
Our data demonstrate considerable differences in the
emerging variables between the univariate and multivariate
analyses. Multivariate analysis variables are more robust
than the univariate variables, because multivariate analysis
selects for variables that are not totally interdependent.
We acknowledge several weaknesses in our analyses,
and these include: 1) it is a retrospective analysis; 2) it is a
single-institution experience and may not be representative of all practices in North America; 3) although most
investigators report on SUVmax, the ideal measure is still
not known, and it may be that global tumor glycolysis36
represents the biology more accurately than SUVmax; and
4) these results have not been confirmed by others. In
addition, all the weaknesses ingrained in the PET assessments of individual patients (for example, those with diabetes) apply. The strengths of our results include: 1) it is
the first report in bimodality therapy patients; 2) it is a
large series; and 3) novel findings were made regarding
initial SUV’s ability to classify patients and establishment
of the postchemoradiation clinical CR category, which
combines biopsy with PET results.
In conclusion, our data suggest that initial SUV has
a prognostic value in esophageal or gastroesophageal carcinoma patients treated with bimodality therapy. The
results also suggest that after bimodality therapy, patients
can be classified in 2 groups: 1) those with good prognosis
after having achieved a clinical CR and 2) those with poor

(less than clinical CR). Further studies are warranted to
validate these observations.
