BACKGROUND. It is unclear how noncancer conditions affect the use or effectiveness of adjuvant therapy among older patients with colon cancer.

METHODS. The authors conducted a cohort study of older patients with stage III
colon cancer who were diagnosed from 1993 to 1999 in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare database. The correlations between receipt of

monary disease (COPD) were assessed. Multivariable regression analysis was
used to assess the risk of death and hospitalization as a function of treatment

RESULTS. The study sample consisted of 5330 patients (median age, 76 years).
The use of adjuvant therapy was related significantly to heart failure (36.2% vs

0.81; 95% CI, 0.68–0.97). Among patients who had heart failure, the 5-year survival was significantly higher among those who received adjuvant chemotherapy
(adjusted 5-year survival rate, 43%; 95% CI, 40–47%) than among those who did
not receive adjuvant chemotherapy (30%; 95% CI, 27–34%). Among patients without heart failure, the 5-year survival estimates among treated and untreated
patients were 54% (95% CI, 52–56%) and 41% (95% CI, 38–44%), respectively. The
probability of all-cause, condition-specific, or toxicity-related hospitalization
associated with adjuvant therapy was not altered by the presence of any of the
3 conditions.

CONCLUSIONS. Although chronic conditions appeared to be a strong barrier to
the receipt of adjuvant chemotherapy, adjuvant therapy appeared to provide a
significant survival benefit to patients who had colon cancer with the conditions
studied. Cancer 2007;109:2410–9.  2007 American Cancer Society.

lder individuals bear the greatest burden of colon cancer. Currently, the median age at diagnosis for patients with colon cancer is >70 years, and most patients in this age group have 4
different chronic conditions.1–3 These chronic conditions have a
substantial impact, because patients with a greater burden of
comorbidity are less likely to survive after a cancer diagnosis.1–5
However, prior work has tended to aggregate chronic conditions
into a comorbidity index with little consideration of how specific
conditions affect patterns of care or outcomes among older patients
with cancer.

Chronic Illness and Chemotherapy/Gross et al.

One important decision facing patients with
stage III colon cancer and their clinicians concerns
the use of adjuvant chemotherapy. Evidence from
clinical trials suggests that adjuvant chemotherapy is
associated with a 34% reduction in mortality, and
population-based observational studies have demonstrated similar survival benefits.6–8 Prior work also
has suggested that the survival benefits associated
with adjuvant therapy do not diminish with increasing age.8,9 However, those findings stand in stark
contrast to current patterns of care, in which increasing age is associated inversely with the receipt of adjuvant therapy.10–13 It has been reported that the use
of adjuvant therapy decreases from approximately
75% of patients ages 65 years to 80 years to <40% of
patients aged >80 years.7,9,14
To understand the use and effectiveness of adjuvant therapy in older patients with colon cancer, it is
imperative to increase our understanding of how
they are affected by noncancer illnesses. The typical
older oncology patient has at least 3 noncancer conditions, and the prevalence of these conditions
increases with age.3 Although patients with a higher
number of conditions tend to receive adjuvant therapy less frequently, it is unclear whether specific
conditions affect the probability of receiving adjuvant
therapy or the risks and benefits of treatment.9,13
Some authors have called for further evidence to
help guide clinical decision-making in this area.8
Although it is possible that comorbid conditions
increase the risk of toxicity-related hospitalizations,
this has not been investigated to our knowledge.9 In
addition, it is unclear whether adjuvant therapy increases the risk of hospitalizations related to exacerbations of the underlying chronic illnesses.
We conducted a population-based study of older
patients with stage III colon cancer to gain a further
understanding of the relation between specific, common comorbid conditions and adjuvant chemotherapy use. Specifically, we determined the degree to
which specific conditions affected the probability of
receiving adjuvant chemotherapy from 1995 to 1999
as well as the risks and benefits of therapy.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Construction of the Study Sample
The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results
(SEER)-Medicare database is a population-based tumor registry that has been linked with Medicare
administrative claims data.15,16 Patient-level information available from SEER includes sociodemographic
characteristics, cancer type, site, histologic grade,
and disease stage.17 Patients aged 67 years who

2411

were diagnosed with primary adenocarcinoma of the
colon from 1993 to 1999 were included in the current
analysis. This age was selected to allow for 2 years of
Medicare eligibility and administrative claims for all
patients. Additional patients were excluded if their
date of death was recorded as prior to or the same
month as the month of their cancer diagnosis
(n ¼ 1446 patients), if the data source was autopsy
or death certificate (n ¼ 120 patients), or if they had
missing information regarding their race (n ¼ 115
patients). Patients were also excluded if they were
ineligible for Medicare Part A and B coverage
(n ¼ 2749 patients) or fee-for-service coverage
(n ¼ 9226 patients) during the 2-year period prior to
their cancer diagnosis, because these services are not
included in Medicare clams files. Of the 28,733
patients with colon cancer who fulfilled these criteria, 6637 patients had stage III colon cancer, and
5490 patients had lived for 6 months after their diagnosis and had undergone resection during that
time. Consistent with prior studies of adjuvant chemotherapy use, we also excluded patients who had not
received chemotherapy and had died within 6 months
of surgery, because we wanted to restrict our sample
to patients who did not have a short-term prognosis
that was so poor that it would preclude their consideration for adjuvant therapy.9 We also excluded 27
patients who had no lymph nodes that were positive
for malignancy, leaving a sample size of 5330.
Patients may have had more than 1 reason for exclusion.

Construction of Variables
Comorbid conditions that comprised the Charlson
comorbidity index as well as additional conditions that
were selected according to clinical judgment were
identified by searching inpatient, outpatient, and physician claims using a modification of a previously specified algorithm.18,19 The claims from 2 years prior to
cancer diagnosis to 30 days afterward diagnosis were
searched for each patient to identify the specific
comorbid conditions of interest. Treatment-related
variables, such as cancer-specific surgery and chemotherapy, were identified by searching patient claims
using previously validated approaches.8,12,20,21 Consistent with prior work, we defined completing a
course of adjuvant therapy as having at least 1 claim
for chemotherapy administration during 5 of 6 consecutive months beginning with the initial claim.22
Condition-related hospitalizations were defined
as hospitalizations with a primary diagnosis code for
1 of the 3 conditions using a previously validated
approach.23 For instance, patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) were categor-

ized according to whether they were hospitalized
with an International Classification of Diseases (ICD)
code consistent with a principal diagnosis of COPD.
Admissions related to acute diabetes complications
were too rare to include in the analysis. Adjuvant
chemotherapy-related toxicity has been associated
with specific complications, some of which require
hospitalization.9,24 Hospital admissions that potentially were the result of toxicity were identified by
searching admission claims for ICD (9th revision)
codes consistent with infection (infection, fever,
septicemia, or bacteremia), hematologic toxicity
(anemia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia), or gastrointestinal (GI)/other toxicity (nausea or vomiting,
dehydration, diarrhea, stomatitis, or adverse effects
of systemic therapy), as reported previously.25,26
Because these diagnoses are nonspecific, we defined
toxicity-attributable hospitalizations as the difference
in the proportion of treated and untreated patients
who were admitted with 1 of these infectious/hematologic/GI diagnoses.

Analysis
We decided a priori to determine whether the use
and effectiveness of adjuvant chemotherapy was
moderated by any of the 3 most common conditions
in our cohort.27 These conditions were congestive
heart failure (CHF), COPD, and diabetes. First, we
identified the factors associated with use of adjuvant
therapy in bivariate analysis. Based on clinical judgment and prior literature, we investigated comorbid
conditions, year of diagnosis, patient age, race
(white, black, other), marital status, urban/rural designation, SEER site, median income (by zip code),
and cancer-specific information, such as histologic
grade, number of lymph nodes positive for carcinoma, and tumor site (proximal colon vs distal colon). The total number of physician visits and the
number of hospitalizations during the 2 years prior
to cancer diagnosis also were included. Significant
variables were entered into a multivariate logistic
regression model to identify that factors that were
associated independently with receiving chemotherapy and, for patients who had initiated therapy, with
completing chemotherapy. The models were evaluated extensively by examining deviance, Pearson, and
Hosmer & Lemeshow goodness-of-fit statistics. There
were 193 patients (3.6%) with missing data on
income. We did multiple imputation with 50 random
draws per missing observation and replaced the
missing value with the mean of the 50 imputed
values.27

Effectiveness
We used propensity scores to control for bias when
comparing outcomes of treated and untreated
patients. Propensity scores represent the probability
of receiving a treatment for an individual with specific characteristics.29 By incorporating all known and
measured confounders of the relation between treatment and outcome, propensity scores allow investigators to compare treated and untreated patients
after balancing the distribution of these background
covariates.29,30 Because different approaches for
using propensity scores offer unique strengths and
limitations, we decided a priori to use 2 approaches
to determine whether our findings would be robust.
In the first approach, we estimated the propensity score for each patient by using a logistic regression model that included the individual covariates
listed in Table 1 as well as SEER registry, year of diagnosis, residence in an urban location versus a rural
location, and median income (by zip code). Then,
the effect of chemotherapy on mortality was examined using a Cox proportional-hazards model that
included the propensity score as a predictor variable.
We also included treatment status and each of the 3
chronic conditions in the model and then examined
whether there was an interaction between chemotherapy and each condition (eg, CHF and chemotherapy). Survival was calculated as the time from
diagnosis until death or December 31, 2002, whichever occurred first; deaths from all causes were
counted as failures. The proportional-hazards assumption was assessed by plotting log-negative/log-survival function over log of time and Shoenfeld
residuals over time. Then, we calculated the predicted
survival according to chemotherapy status after stratifying according to the presence or absence of each
comorbid condition and the setting propensity score
to the sample mean.
The second approach involved matching patients
by propensity score. Because patients with chronic
conditions are less likely to receive treatment, we
were concerned that the relation between covariates
and receipt of adjuvant therapy might be different
according to comorbidity status. Therefore, as a complement to our first approach in which the full sample was evaluated in single pool, we also recalculated
the propensity score in each chronic condition
group. We then used the propensity score to match
each treated patient with an untreated patient.31 For
example, we were able to match 1037 pairs (with and
without chemotherapy) of patients without CHF and
217 pairs of patients with CHF. Then, we re-estimated the survival model in each group. We repeated
the analysis after stratifying the chemotherapy vari-

Bivariate analysis was used to compare the frequency of each of the 3 types of hospitalizations

using the chi-square test. We then examined the independent association between treatment status and

conditions was not related significantly to toxicityrelated hospitalizations for patients who received
chemotherapy, the results from combinations of conditions are not presented. All statistical tests were 2tailed, and all analyses were performed using SAS
software (version 9.1).32

RESULTS
The final study sample consisted of 5330 patients,
and 60.3% of those patients had received adjuvant
therapy. Approximately 59.5% of the patients were
women, 87% were white, and the median age was 76
years. Increasing age was related inversely to the
probability of receiving chemotherapy in addition to
being a woman, the total number of comorbid conditions, and being unmarried at the time of cancer
diagnosis (Table 1). Overall, approximately 46.5% of
the study sample had no claims consistent with
comorbid conditions, 44.7% had 1 or 2 conditions,
and 8.8% had 3 conditions. The total number of
chronic conditions was related strongly to the receipt
of chemotherapy, Overall, 69.1% of patients with no
conditions and 38.6% of patients with 3 conditions
received treatment.
The most common comorbid conditions in the
study cohort included heart failure (16%), COPD
(18.8%), and diabetes (17.8%). The receipt of adjuvant therapy was related significantly to heart failure
(36.2% vs 64.9% of patients with vs without heart
failure, respectively, adjusted odds ratio [OR], 0.49;
95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.40–0.60). More

moderate relations were observed for COPD (55.2%
vs 61.5% of patients with vs without COPD, respectively; OR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.70–0.99) and diabetes
(58.3% vs 60.7% of patients with vs without diabetes,
respectively; OR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.68–0.97). Among the
patients who started chemotherapy, there was not a
consistent relation between having the chronic conditions and completing the regimen (Table 2).

Effectiveness
The median survival was 4 years, and 3166 patients
died (59.4%) during follow-up. The maximum followup was 10 years. Adjuvant therapy was associated
with a significant reduction in mortality (hazard ratio
[HR], 0.70; 95% CI, 0.64–0.76) after adjusting for
sociodemographic and clinical characteristics using
propensity scores. Patients who received chemotherapy and did not have heart failure had the highest
survival probability, whereas patients who did not
receive chemotherapy and did have CHF had the
lowest probability of survival (Fig. 1, left). However, it
is noteworthy that the difference in survival curves
between treated and untreated patients was similar
for patients with and without CHF. For instance,
among patients who had CHF, the 5-year survival
probability was 43% (95% CI, 40–47%) if they
received chemotherapy compared with 30% (95% CI,
27–34%) among patients who did not receive chemotherapy. Similarly, among patients without CHF, the
5-year survival was estimated at 54% (95% CI, 52–
56%) among patients who received chemotherapy
compared with 41% (95% CI, 38–44%) among
patients who did not receive chemotherapy. This survival benefit associated with chemotherapy was consistent across time and also was demonstrated after
stratifying by COPD and diabetes status (Fig. 1, middle and right, respectively). Treated patients had a
higher 5-year survival than untreated patients for all
groups, including patients who had COPD (46.2% vs
32.9%, respectively, for treated vs untreated patients)
or diabetes (47.4% vs 34.1%, respectively).
When we repeated the analysis after stratifying
patients according to chronic disease status and then
matching them by propensity score, the results were
similar. Among the 2074 patients without CHF, the
HR for mortality associated with chemotherapy use
was 0.67 (95% CI, 0.60–0.75) (Fig. 2). Among the
patients with CHF, adjuvant chemotherapy use was
associated with an HR of 0.70 (95% CI, 0.56–0.87).
The findings were similar after stratifying by diabetes
and COPD status and by the total number of chronic
conditions (Fig. 2).

Hospitalizations
Among the patients with heart failure, the probability
of having any hospitalization during the year after
cancer surgery was similar for patients who received
adjuvant therapy (54.7% 95% CI, 49.0–60.3%) and for
patients who did not receive adjuvant therapy
(52.4%; 95% CI: 48.1–56.6%) (Fig. 3). These findings
persisted after adjusting for sociodemographic and
clinical factors (adjusted OR for hospitalization for
CHF patients who received adjuvant therapy vs
untreated patients: 1.06; 95% CI, 0.75–1.50). Similarly,
the receipt of adjuvant therapy was not associated
with an increased probability of all-cause hospitalization for patients with COPD or diabetes (adjusted
P ¼ .48 and P ¼ .85, respectively). The probability of
condition-specific hospitalizations for patients with

CHF or COPD also was not related significantly to
treatment status (Fig. 3B). Among patients with CHF,
for instance, approximately 7.1% (95% CI, 4.5–10.6%)
of treated patients and 8.8% (95% CI, 6.6–11.5%) of
untreated patients were admitted with a CHF exacerbation (P ¼ .80 in the multivariate model).
Patients with chronic conditions were more likely
than patients without chronic conditions to be hospitalized with GI, hematologic, or infectious diagnoses after their surgery. Among patients who
received adjuvant therapy, 8.8% of patients without
CHF (95% CI, 6.3–11.4%) compared with 5.4% of
patients with CHF (1.1–12%) experienced a hospitalization that was attributable to chemotherapy
toxicity (Table 3). In multivariate analysis, chemotherapy increased the odds of GI/hematologic/infec-

tious hospitalization for patients without CHF, but
not for patients with CHF (adjusted odds for treated
vs untreated patients: 1.92 [95% CI, 1.60–2.30] and
1.20 [95% CI, 0.82–1.73], respectively). The interaction between chemotherapy and CHF was of borderline significance (P ¼ .07), suggesting that chemotherapy may increase the risk of chemotherapyrelated toxicity in CHF patients to a lesser degree
that it does in patients without CHF. There were no
significant interactions between either COPD or dia-

betes and adjuvant therapy, suggesting that the
receipt of therapy increased the risk of toxicityrelated hospitalization to the same degree in patients
with and without these conditions (Table 3).

DISCUSSION

adjuvant therapy. We observed that individual conditions varied in their relation to the use and outcomes
associated with treatment. Patients with heart failure
were <50% as likely as patients without heart failure
to receive adjuvant therapy after the underwent surgical resection for colon cancer, whereas COPD had
a modest relation and diabetes had little impact on
receipt of therapy. This emphasizes the importance
of moving beyond a comorbidity index when investigating the care and outcomes of older cancer
patients. Simply counting the number of conditions
with which each patient has been diagnosed may
overlook important distinctions between conditions.
The inverse relation between CHF and adjuvant
therapy use may be a result of the clinical concern
that preexisting cardiac disease can alter the balance
between risks and benefits of adjuvant treatment.33,34
Our results do not support this concern. We
observed, for example, that the relative reduction in
the risk of mortality associated with adjuvant chemotherapy was similar in patients with and without
CHF. In addition, the difference in adjusted 5-year
survival associated with adjuvant therapy was even
more favorable among patients with CHF (43% vs
29% for treated and untreated patients, respectively)
than for patients without CHF (54% v. 41%, respectively). The findings were consistent for the other
chronic conditions we investigated and for the total
number of conditions. We also observed that CHF
was not associated significantly with decreased odds
of completing chemotherapy after controlling for the
other covariates Thus, although comorbidity was
associated with an increased risk of death, it did not

diminish the relative survival benefit associated with
treatment. Furthermore, adjuvant therapy was not
associated with increased all-cause, condition-specific, or toxicity-related hospitalization rates for patients
with the chronic conditions of interest.
Because we were only able to account for measured confounders, treatment assignment bias may
account for some of the survival benefit attributed to
adjuvant therapy. That is, patients with CHF who
received treatment may have represented the healthiest subset of CHF patients, and this baseline difference may affect inferences about effectiveness.
Therefore, it is reassuring that our overall findings
(adjusted HR, 0.70) are consistent with those of prior
observational studies (HR, 0.66-.073) and with the
results from a pooled analysis of clinical trial data.7,8
This reinforces prior quantitative analyses, which
demonstrated that well-designed observational studies can yield estimates of treatment effectiveness
that are similar to those reported in randomized
trials.35–37 We also employed additional, novel
approaches to account for bias. To capture health
status, we adjusted for prior hospitalizations and
physician visits. Furthermore, unlike most prior analyses, we employed complementary approaches,
using matching (by propensity score) and adjusting
(for propensity score) to analyze treatment effectiveness within clinical subgroups. Our separate matching strategy assured that all covariates in Table 1
were well balanced between treated and untreated
patients among those with and without the 3 chronic
conditions. Our findings were consistent across both
approaches. Finally, because our sample was re-

stricted to patients who had undergone surgery,
patients with more severe CHF or COPD may have
been excluded from the sample on the basis of their
poor surgical risk. Hence, the patients in our sample
may represent a relatively healthy subgroup of patients with these conditions.
It is important to recognize that administrative
data do not capture all clinical diagnoses of chronic
conditions, nor do they capture all outcomes that are
of interest to patients, including potential chemotherapy toxicities. In addition, SEER-Medicare data
may not distinguish reliably between cancer- and
noncancer-related outcomes, such as death or hospitalization. Also, our study period (the late 1990s) was
immediately prior to the availability of newer agents,
such as capecitabine and oxiplatin, with varying risk,
benefit, and cost profiles.38–40 Hence, 5-flourourocil
still was the standard of care for patients in our
cohort.20,22 Clinical decision-making will be facilitated by a greater understanding of the harms and
benefits of newer agents across a spectrum of
patients, including those with comorbidities, as the
portfolio of treatment options expands.
We have observed that chronic conditions may
affect patterns of cancer care in a manner that does
not reflect their relation to clinical effectiveness. This
discrepancy between effectiveness and utilization
may reflect the lack of available data, because clinicians and patients need to know how the balance
between harms and benefits of a proposed cancer
treatment are by altered noncancer conditions.
Unfortunately, the recent emphasis on increasing the
representation of elderly patients with comorbid conditions into clinical trials has had meager success to
date.41–44 Future work should include prospective
studies that have patient-reported outcome measures,
such as quality of life, symptom burden, and functional status, with a focus on determining whether
these are affected positively or negatively by treatment in patients with comorbid conditions. Because
multimorbidity increasingly is the norm among patients with cancer, physicians and patients need
access to the data required to make informed and
appropriate treatment decisions.
