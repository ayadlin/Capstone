ABSTRACT
Anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) is rare but it is one of the most lethal human
malignancies with no effective therapy. There is a pressing need to identify new
therapeutic agents for ATC. We performed quantitative high-throughput screening
(qHTS) in ATC cell lines using a compound library of 3,282 drugs. qHTS identified
100 pan-active agents. Enrichment analysis of qHTS data showed drugs targeting
mTOR were one of the most active drug categories, and Torin2 showed the highest
efficacy. We found mTOR to be upregulated in ATC. Treatment of multiple ATC cell
lines with Torin2 showed significant dose-dependent inhibition of cellular proliferation
with caspase-dependent apoptosis and G1/S phase arrest. Torin2 inhibited cellular
migration and inhibited the phosphorylation of key effectors of the mTOR-pathway
(AKT, 4E-BP1 and 70S6K), as well as claspin and survivin expression, regulators of cell
cycle and apoptosis. In our in vivo mouse model of metastatic ATC, Torin2 inhibited
tumor growth and metastasis and significantly prolonged overall survival. Our findings
suggest that Torin2 is a promising agent for ATC therapy and that it effectively targets
upregulated pathways in human ATC.

INTRODUCTION

For example, it has been estimated that to bring a single
drug to market takes an average of 15 years and costs
approximately $800 million [6]. Therefore, quantitative
high-throughput screening (qHTS) of existing drugs has
emerged as an attractive alternative, especially for orphan
cancers such as ATC [7-9]. Screening a drug library has
several advantages, which include knowledge of the
drugs pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamics and toxicity
profile. This information could lead to a more efficient
repurposing of drugs for rare cancers. Another important
advantage of screening a Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) approved drug library with known mechanism of
action, is the ability to determine whether compound(s)
found to be active on qHTS can target molecular pathways
that are altered in human malignancies.
In this study, we performed qHTS in multiple ATC
cell lines, and identified active compounds that were

Anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) is one of the most
deadly solid human malignancies. It represents less than
2% of all thyroid cancers, has an annual incidence of
1-2 cases per million population per year but accounts
for nearly one-third of thyroid cancer deaths [1, 2]. The
median survival of patients with ATC is less than 6 month,
and 90% of patients with ATC present with unresectable
locally advanced or distant metastatic disease at time of
diagnosis [3, 4]. There is currently no standard or effective
therapy for ATC and the survival of patients with ATC has
not improved in over 6 decades [3, 5]. Thus, there is an
unmet need to identify effective agents for the treatment
of ATC.
Drug discovery and development can be costly and
take a long time to identify a clinically effective agent.

enriched for drugs targeting the mTOR pathway. We then
demonstrate that the mTOR pathway is upregulated in
ATC with validation of the potent anticancer effects of an
irreversible potent mTOR inhibitor, Torin2, in vitro and
in vivo. Furthermore, we show Torin2 mediates caspasedependent apoptosis while reducing the anti-apoptosis
protein survivin, which is upregulated in ATC. Lastly,
Torin2 also induced G1/S phase arrest in ATC cells
resulting in decreased claspin protein levels, a protein
required for DNA replication.

active agent of nine mTOR inhibitors in all three ATC
cell lines screened based on efficacy (maximum response
>100%), best dose-response curve class, and the lowest
half-maximum inhibitory concentration (IC50) (≤ 0.8µM)
(Figure 1A). Although there is no effective chemotherapy
agent for ATC, agents such as docetaxel and doxorubicin
have been used as monotherapy or in combination [10-12].
Thus, we compared Torin2 activity in the three ATC cell
lines to both agents and found Torin2 had better activity
(maximum response and lower IC50) than docetaxel and
doxorubicin (Figure 1B).

RESULTS

Torin2 inhibits cellular proliferation in ATC cell
lines, increases caspase activity and decreases
cellular migration

Quantitative high-throughput screening identifies
mTOR inhibitors are active in ATC cells

In vitro studies using Torin2 in seven ATC cell lines
showed a significant dose-dependent inhibition of cellular
proliferation (Figure 2A). We found high concentrations
of Torin2 were cytotoxic. Thus, we next asked whether
Torin2 induced apoptosis. We found Torin2 increased

We identified 100 active agents in the three ATC
cell lines screened. Enrichment analysis by mode of
drug action showed mTOR inhibitors to be one of the
highest-ranking drug categories. Torin2 was the most

caspase 3/7 activity, increased the number of cells in G1
and decreased the number of cells in S-phase (Figure 2B2C), which is consistent with the effect on apoptosis [13].
To investigate the mechanism of how Torin2
induced apoptosis and G1/S-phase arrest, we analyzed
the expression level of apoptosis-related proteins with
an antibody array. We found that Torin2 reduced claspin,

HIF-1α and survivin levels in a dose dependent fashion in
all three cell lines, as shown in Figure 2D. Torin2 had a
dose-dependent effect on survivin protein levels (Figure
2E).
We next investigated whether Torin2 had an effect
on cellular migration as ATC is highly invasive and the
mTOR pathway has been implicated in regulating cellular

migration and epithelial-mesenchymal-transition (EMT), a
feature omnipresent in ATC [14, 15]. Torin2 significantly
inhibited cellular migration in 2 of 3 ATC cell lines, with
a trend in 8505c cells when compared to control (Figure
3A). Given this effect on cellular migration, we evaluated
whether Torin2 had an effect on proteins known to mediate
EMT and found no significant effect on Vimentin, CD44
and N-cadherin protein levels (Figure 3B).

of mTOR on Ser 2448, which is specific to the mTORC1
site and total mTOR levels (Figure 4A). Torin2 also
decreased phosphorylation of AKT Ser473 and total AKT
levels in a dose dependent fashion in all three ATC cell
lines (Figure 4A). We next analyzed the downstream
effectors of mTORC1, phospho-proteins 4E-BP1 and
S6K [16, 17]. Torin2 showed a dose-dependent inhibition
of phospho-4E-BP1 and S6K, and total 4E-BP1 in all 3
ATC cell lines; as well as a dose-dependent inhibition of
phospho-PRAS40, which is a component and substrate of
mTORC1 and a substrate of AKT (Figure 4B) [18].

decreased in the control group with increasing tumor
burden.

Torin2 targets are upregulated in ATC

Our in vitro data showed that Torin2 treatment
inhibits ATC cellular proliferation, induces caspasedependent apoptosis, decreased cellular migration, and
effectively inhibits mTOR and mTORC1-related effectors
of the mTOR pathway. Therefore, we investigated the
effect of Torin2 treatment in a metastatic mouse model
of ATC, which mimics the heavy tumor burden seen
in human metastatic ATC [19]. We first evaluated if
pretreatment of mice could reduce the rate of metastasis
given the effects on cellular migration we observed in
vitro. Torin2 significantly reduced ATC metastasis in mice
pretreated with Torin2 (Figure 5A-5B). We then treated
mice with established metastasis with Torin2. We found
decreased growth and metastases with Torin2 treatment
(Figure 5C-5F). The tumor burden was approximately
one-third in the treated mice, with fewer mice developing
diffuse metastases (liver and bone) with treatment (16%
versus 67%) (Figure 5C-5F). Torin2 treatment in mice
with established metastasis was also associated with
longer survival time, median 1 week longer, (p < 0.005)
(Figure 5G). We observed no toxicity with Torin2. Weekly
weights were stable in both groups until week 4, and then

Given that Torin2 had potent in vitro and in
vivo effects in ATC, we next determined if the proteins
targeted by this agent are dysregulated in ATC. Using
human thyroid tissue arrays, we compared the staining
of phospho-mTOR and mTOR in ATC versus normal
and benign thyroid tissues. For mTOR, the H-score was
significantly higher in ATC samples (the average readings
of the duplicate sections showed an H-score of 1.6 in the
normal and benign samples versus 147 in ATC samples,
p < 0.05) (Figure 6A-6B). Additionally, we found Torin2
reduced survivin levels in vitro and therefore analyzed
the expression of this protein in ATC. We found survivin
protein expression to be positive in ATC and papillary
thyroid cancer compared to normal thyroid tissue samples
(Figure 6A), consistent with evidence that survivin
overexpression is associated with progression to poorly
differentiated thyroid cancer [20] and reduced survival
in colorectal cancer [21]. These findings suggest that
the targets of Torin2 are upregulated in ATC making it
a rationale targeted agent for ATC. Further, we analyzed

of AKT, phospho-AKTSer473, mTORSer2448 (mTORC1 site) and total mTOR. ATC cells were treated with Torin2 for 48 hours at T1 = 0.05

reduced staining for survivin (reduced nuclear staining)
and HIF-1α, a marker of aggressive cancer (Figure 6C)
[22, 23].

We performed qHTS in ATC cell lines and
identified mTOR inhibitors to be one of the most active
drug categories. Torin2 was the most active compound in
ATC cells and effectively inhibited cellular proliferation,
induced increased caspase activity and S-phase arrest,

and inhibited cellular migration in vitro. In addition to
inhibiting mTOR and the downstream effectors of the
mTOR pathway (4E-BP1 and S6K), Torin2 inhibited the
phosphorylation of AKT, an important signaling (PI3K/
AKT/mTOR)-pathway in ATC and a variety of cancers
[24]. In vivo, Torin2 inhibited growth and metastasis.
Further, we show Torin2 to be more active than current
therapies such as docetaxel and doxorubicin, and
demonstrate that the targets of Torin2 are upregulated in
ATC making it an attractive targeted therapy for ATC.
The mTOR-pathway controls cell survival and cell
growth and is involved in multiple cancers and has been
actively investigated as a target for cancer therapies [25,
26]. Several studies have investigated the mTOR-pathway
in ATC. Papewalis and colleagues showed that everolimus
inhibits the growth of ATC cell lines in a dose-dependent
fashion [27] and Liu and associates have shown that
phospho-mTOR is activated in ATC [28] consistent with
our results. However, one of the shortcomings of using

everolimus and other rapalogs to target the PI3K/ AKT/
mTOR-pathway is the development of resistance with
long-term treatment as a result of reactivation of AKT
and mTORC2 as these drugs target only mTORC1 [26,
29, 30]. More promising results have been observed
in lung cancer and renal cell carcinoma models if the
mTOR-pathway is targeted by inhibiting both AKT and
mTOR [31, 32]. To overcome this limitation of AKT reactivation with everolimus and other rapalogs treatment,
new second generation, ATP-competitive drugs have been
developed that target both mTOR-complexes, mTORC1
and mTORC2, such as Torin2. Liu et al. [32] showed
that Torin2 inhibits AKT and mTORC1, overcoming the
feedback reactivation of AKT due to long term mTORC1
treatment, but it was effective in an in vivo lung tumor
model only when combined with a MEK inhibitor. Simioni
et al. [33] showed promising dual mTORC1 and mTORC2
inhibition with Torin2 in B-precursor acute lymphoblastic
leukemia. Similar results have been reported in papillary

thyroid cancer using a tumor flank xenograft model [34].
Lastly, a recent clinical report of a patient with metastatic
ATC enrolled in a Phase II trial of everolimus therapy,
showed resistance after an extraordinary 18 months of
response. Whole-exome sequencing of pretreatment
and drug resistant tumors revealed a mutation in mTOR
that conferred resistance to allosteric mTOR inhibition
(everolimus), but the mutation remained sensitive to a
direct ATP-competitive mTOR kinase inhibitor such as
Torin1 [35].
To our knowledge, this is the first study that shows
Torin2 is active in ATC cells and in an in vivo mouse
model of ATC that recapitulates the heavy tumor burden
seen in patients with ATC [19]. We also show for the first
time that Torin2 treatment in ATC cells results in lower
claspin and survivin levels in ATC cells consistent with
its effect on G1/S phase arrest and apoptosis, respectively
[20, 36, 37]. Furthermore, Torin2 treatment in vivo was
associated with reduced phospho-4E-BP1, HIF-1α and
survivin protein expression in ATC responsive tumor
samples. These data taken together show Torin2 to be
potent in ATC suggesting it would be a good targeted
therapeutic agent in patients with ATC.
In ATC, TP53 inactivating mutations are most
common, occurring in 42-55% of cases, followed by
mutations in genes involved in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR,
MAPK and WNT signaling pathways, mutations in RAS
and BRAF (25%) [38, 39], and mutations in PIK3CA
and PTEN, that occur in 17-23% and 12%, respectively,
of ATC cases [38, 40]. Anti-BRAFV600E therapy has
shown good activity in BRAF mutant cells in vitro and
in vivo [41-43]. We found that Torin2 was effective in
all cell lines harboring a similar mutation profile (BRAF
V600E, TP53, HRAS, PTEN,  KRAS,  RB, and PI3KCA)
as observed in human ATC tumor samples. This suggests
that the activity of Torin2 is independent of the presence
of driver mutations, which may activate the alternate
MAPK pathway. We also identified claspin and survivin
as new targets, which are dysregulated in ATC and that
are reduced with Torin2 treatment in ATC cells. Survivin is
upregulated in human ATC samples and is associated with
more aggressive disease in differentiated thyroid cancer
[20, 37]. These findings further support that Torin2 may be
effective in patients with locally advanced and metastatic
ATC.
In summary, we show that the mTOR-pathway is
upregulated in ATC and that mTOR inhibitors are potent
in ATC cell lines in vitro and in vivo. Torin2 effectively
inhibits mTOR and mTOR-pathway effectors at multiple
levels, and dysregulated protein targets in ATC such as
survivin. Our findings taken together show that Torin2 is
a good candidate drug for ATC treatment and should be
considered for a clinical trial in patients with ATC.

Quantitative high-throughput screening (qHTS)
and compound library
The compound library consists of 3,282 small
molecules that are either drugs that have been approved
for human or animal use by the United States FDA or
drug candidates that are currently in investigational use.
Cell viability after drug treatment was measured using a
luciferase-coupled ATP quantification assay (CellTiterGlo®, Promega, Madison, WI) in three ATC cell lines:
8505c, C643, and SW1736. qHTS was performed as
previously described [7, 9]. To determine compound
activity in the qHTS assay, the titration-response data
was plotted and modeled by a four parameter logistic fit
yielding half maximum inhibitory concentration (IC50) and
efficacy (maximal response) values. Raw plate reads for
each titration point were normalized relative to a positive
control defined as 100% inhibition (Tetraoctylammonium
bromide, 100% inhibition) and DMSO only wells (defined
as 0% inhibition). To assess the drug categories that
were active in 8505c, C643, and SW1736 ATC cells,
we performed enrichment analysis by the drug mode of
action. The enrichment score was defined as the ratio of
number of active drugs to the total of number tested drugs
in that drug category (mode of action).

mTOR inhibitor Torin2
Torin2 was purchased from Selleckchem (Houston,
TX) for in vitro and in vivo experiments. The drug was
diluted in DMSO for in vitro studies and in Captisol®
(Ligand Pharmaceuticals, Inc., La Jolla, CA) for animal
studies.

Cell lines
Human ATC cell lines, 8505c (purchased from the
European Collection of Cell Cultures, Salisbury UK),
C643 and SW1736 (purchased from CLS Cell Lines
Service GmbH, Germany), and THJ-11T, THJ-16T,
THJ-21T and THJ-29T (kindly provided by Dr. John
A. Copland III, Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, FA) were
maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium
(DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum
(FCS), penicillin (100 U/mL), streptomycin (100 μg/
mL), fungizone (250 ng/mL), TSH (10 IU/L), and
insulin (10 μg/mL) in 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37oC. All
cell lines were authenticated by short tandem repeat
profiling. The most relevant mutations profile of the
ATC cell lines are 8505c (BRAF V600E, TP53), C643
(HRAS, TP53, PTEN), SW1736 (BRAF V600E, TP53,

Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) and anti-beta actin
(1:5000, sc-81178, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used
as loading controls. The membranes were incubated with
the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated IgG
(anti-rabbit 1:3000, Cell Signaling Technology, or antimouse 1:10000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and proteins
were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL;
Thermo scientific, Rockford, IL).

Cell proliferation, apoptosis and cell cycle assays
Cells were plated in 96-well plates and treated with
Torin2 or vehicle control (DMSO) and the CyQUANT
assay (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) was used
to assess cell viability, according to the manufacturer’s
instructions on a SpectraMax M5 ® microplate reader
(Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA).
Caspase-Glo 3/7 assay (Promega, UK) was used
to measure caspase activity after 48 hours of treatment
according to the manufacturer’s instruction.
For cell cycle analysis, cells were treated for 12, 24
and 48 hours. They were harvested, fixed with cold 70%
ethanol for 30 minutes at 4°C, and then incubated in the
dark with RNase (100 Mg/ml) and propidium iodide (50
Mg/ml) for 30 minutes at 37°C. A total of 20,000 cells
were examined by flow cytometry using a Canto I flow
cytometer (Becton-Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ). Data
were analyzed using ModFit software (Verity Software
House, Topsham, ME).

Apoptosis array
The expression profile of apoptosis-related proteins
was detected and analyzed using a human apoptosis
array kit (ARY009), according to the manufacturer’s
instruction (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). The
membranes containing apoptosis-related antibodies were
blocked with Array buffer for 1 h on a rocking platform
and then incubated with lysates of untreated (DMSO)
or Torin2 treated ATC cell lines (8505c, C643 and
SW1736) overnight at 4°C. Chemiluminescent detection
reagent was used after incubation with streptavidinHRP conjugate. The membranes were scanned and pixel
density was quantified by the mean of two replicate spot
densities normalized to internal background using Image J
software. Targets showing a two-fold difference in density
to background ratio (increase or decrease) when compared
to vehicle were selected.

Migration assay
Cell migration was assessed using a Transwell
chamber assay (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) according
to the manufacturer’s protocol. The lower chamber of
the plate was filled with 750 μL DMEM supplemented
with 10% FBS as a chemoattractant. After 22 hours of
incubation at 37°C, the cells invading through the bottom
surface of the inserts were fixed, stained with Diff-Quik
(Dade Behring Newark, NJ), and photographed and
counted using Image J software (NIH, Bethesda, MD).

Immunohistochemistry
Tissue microarrays were purchased from US
Biomax, Rockville, MD (#TH641) and included duplicate
samples of 6 follicular adenomas, 6 follicular thyroid
carcinomas, 6 papillary thyroid carcinomas, and 6
ATC, and 6 normal tissues from thyroid, 10 from lungs,
testis, and adrenal pheochromocytoma. Slides were
deparaffinized and rehydrated, and incubated with the
primary antibody for phospho-mTOR Ser2448 and mTOR
(Cell Signaling Technology) overnight as previously
reported [45]. Staining intensity and percent of positive
cells were analyzed and scored blinded by a clinical
pathologist (P.K.). Further, mouse lung tissue slides from
in vivo mouse studies were deparaffinized, rehydrated,
and incubated with the primary antibody for phospho-4EBP1 Thr37/46 (Cell Signaling Technology). The extent
of staining (percentage of positive cell: 10/high power
field) and intensity (0 for negative, 1 for weakly positive,

Total cell lysates were analyzed by SDSPAGE, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and
immunostained with the following antibodies overnight at
4°C: anti-vimentin (1:1000, ab92547, AbCam, Cambridge,
MA); anti-CD44 (1:1000, #5640, Cell Signaling

determined and an H score was assigned to each tissue
section as a product of the extent of immunoexpression
and the intensity of staining as previously described
[45]. Additionally, anti-Survivin (NB500-201, Novusbio,
Littleton, CO) at 1:500 dilution, and anti-HIF-1α (
[ESEE122,], ab8366, Abcam, Cambridge, MA) at 1:500
dilution were used for immunostaining using Vectastain
ABC and DAB kits (Vector Laboratories, Inc. Burlingame,
CA). Slides were scanned at cited magnification using a
ScanScope XT digital slide scanner and viewed using
ImageScope software (Aperio Technologies, Inc., Vista,
CA).

In vivo ATC metastasis mouse model

REFERENCES

An in vivo ATC metastasis mouse model was used
to assess the effect of Torin2 on growth and metastasis as
previously described [19]. 8505c cells, stably transfected
with a luciferase reporter gene Luc2, were injected into
the tail vein of six- to eight-week-old NOD.Cg-Prkdcscid
Il2rgtm1Wjl/SzJ mice purchased from The Jackson
Laboratory (Maine, USA). The mice were maintained and
bred according to the guidelines of the institute’s Animal
Advisory Committee. Immediately after tail vein injection,
bioluminescence imaging was used to assess the injected
cells in all mice using the Xenogen in vivo imaging system
(Caliper Life Sciences Inc., Hopkinton, MA). Mice were
injected intraperitoneally with 30 mg/mL of luciferin 15
minutes prior to imaging. Signal intensity was quantified
as the sum of all detected photon counts within a region of
interest using IVIS Living Image software (Caliper Life
Sciences Inc., Hopkinton, MA).
To confirm tumor development in specific organ
sites, ex vivo images were obtained. After whole body
imaging, the mice were euthanized by CO2 inhalation
and the organs were isolated and imaged again with the
Xenogen system. Then the organs were fixed in formalin
for histologic analysis. For animal survival analysis, mice
were maintained under normal immunodeficient mouse
care conditions, and monitored daily to assess their health
status. Once the mice reached the humane euthanasia
endpoints they were euthanized . Before euthanization,
mice were imaged as described above.
