Abstract

Author Manuscript

Neuroblastoma (NB) is a pediatric tumor of neural crest origin with heterogeneous phenotypes.
While low stage tumors carry a favorable prognosis, over 50% of high risk NB relapses after
treatment with a fatal outcome. Thus, developing therapies targeting refractory NB remains an
unsolved clinical problem. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its TrkB receptor are
known to protect NB cells from chemotherapy-induced cell death, while neuropeptide Y (NPY),
acting via its Y2 receptor (Y2R), is an autocrine proliferative and angiogenic factor crucial for
maintaining NB tumor growth. Here, we show that in NB cells, BDNF stimulates the synthesis of
NPY and induces expression of another one of its receptors, Y5R. In human NB tissues, the
expression of NPY and Y5R positively correlated with the expression of BDNF and TrkB.
Functionally, BDNF triggered Y5R internalization in NB cells, while Y5R antagonist inhibited
BDNF-induced p44/42-MAPK activation and its pro-survival activity. These observations
suggested TrkB-Y5R transactivation that resulted in cross-talk between their signaling pathways.
Additionally, NPY and Y5R were up-regulated in a BDNF-independent manner in NB cells under
pro-apoptotic conditions, such as serum deprivation and chemotherapy, as well as in cell lines and
tissues derived from post-treatment NB tumors. Blocking Y5R in chemoresistant NB cells rich in
this receptor sensitized them to chemotherapy-induced apoptosis and inhibited their growth in vivo
by augmenting cell death. In summary, the NPY/Y5R axis is an inducible survival pathway

activated in NB by BDNF or cellular stress. Upon such activation, Y5R augments the pro-survival
effect of BDNF via its interactions with TrkB receptor and exerts an additional BDNFindependent anti-apoptotic effect, both of which contribute to NB chemoresistance. Therefore, the
NPY/Y5R pathway may become a novel therapeutic target for patients with refractory NB, thus
far an incurable form of this disease.

Introduction
Author Manuscript

Neuroblastoma (NB) is a pediatric malignancy with heterogeneous phenotypes.1 While low
stage NB carries a favorable prognosis, 50–60% of high risk tumors relapse with a fatal
outcome.2,3 At present, there is no adequate therapy for refractory NB and the mechanisms
underlying its chemoresistance are poorly understood.

Author Manuscript

NB develops from precursors of sympathetic neurons and the level of neuronal
differentiation is one of the major factors determining its clinical behavior, with
undifferentiated tumors being the most aggressive.2,4,5 These tumors express neuronal
markers and respond to factors regulating neuronal functions, such as brain derived
neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK), TrkB.6,7 BDNF is
known for its neuroprotective effects.8–10 In NB, BDNF is often endogenously expressed
and acts as a pro-survival factor, enhancing resistance of these tumors to chemotherapy.11–14
These chemoresistance effects are mediated by the PI3K/Akt and p44/42 MAPK
pathways.8–14 Consistently, a high level of TrkB in NB tumors is an adverse prognostic
factor.7,15–18 Paradoxically, expression of TrkB in cell lines derived from advanced NBs is
low or non-detectable.17 Therefore, NB cells stably transfected with TrkB are commonly
used to study the role of BDNF in these tumors.11–14

Author Manuscript

Another neuronal protein, a sympathetic neurotransmitter neuropeptide Y (NPY), is highly
expressed in NB and its elevated systemic levels have been associated with poor clinical
outcome in high risk NB patients.19–21 NPY, acting via its G protein-coupled receptors
(GPCRs), is known to stimulate cell proliferation and act as an angiogenic factor.22–27 Both
NPY and its Y2 receptor (Y2R) are universally expressed in NBs.28,29 We have previously
shown that this autocrine loop is essential for maintaining NB cell proliferation and tumor
vascularization. Consequently, Y2R antagonist impairs tumor growth due to its antiproliferative and anti-angiogenic effects.29 However, some NB cell lines additionally
express another NPY receptor, Y5R.28 In contrast to Y2R, Y5R expression is variable and
its role in NB remains unknown.
Similar to BDNF, NPY is also known for its neuroprotective activities mediated via p44/42
MAPK.30,31 Interestingly, BDNF stimulates NPY expression in neuronal cells.32–37 Thus,
the goal of this study was to determine the molecular and functional interactions between
BDNF and NPY systems in NB and their role in the biology of these tumors. We
demonstrated that BDNF, acting via TrkB receptor, stimulates expression of NPY and its

Y5R. This, in turn, facilitates cross-talk between TrkB and Y5R signaling pathways, which
then enhances pro-survival activity of BDNF. In addition to this BDNF-induced activation,
NPY and Y5R are also up-regulated in NB cells undergoing cellular stress, such as
chemotherapy, and are highly expressed in cell lines and tissues derived from post-treatment
patients. Such activation of the NPY/Y5R axis enhances NB cell survival, while blocking
Y5R sensitizes them to chemotherapy. Taken together, we provide the first evidence for
Y5R acting as an inducible pro-survival factor in NB, contributing to their chemoresistance.

Results
BDNF stimulates NPY system expression in NB

Author Manuscript

Given the low TrkB expression in NB cell lines, SH-SY5Y NB cells stably transfected with
TrkB (SY5Y/TrkB) were used to determine interactions between NPY and BDNF
systems.11,17 NPY release was elevated in SY5Y/TrkB cells, as compared to non-transfected
SH-SY5Y cells (Fig. 1A), suggesting a TrkB-mediated stimulatory effect of endogenous
BDNF on NPY expression. Indeed, in SY5Y/TrkB cells, BDNF increased NPY and Y5R
mRNA, but not Y2R mRNA (Fig. 1B). The selective increase in Y5R expression induced by
BDNF was confirmed on a protein level by Western blot (Fig. 1C). Trk inhibitor, K252a,
blocked these stimulatory effects of BDNF on NPY and Y5R expression (Fig. 1B, C). No
further increase in NPY release was detected in BDNF-treated SY5Y/TrkB cells, suggesting
saturation of the system by endogenous neurotrophin.

Author Manuscript

A similar stimulatory effect of BDNF on NPY system expression was observed in native NB
cells. Despite a lower expression of TrkB receptor, non-transfected NB cells remained
responsive to its ligand, as measured by BDNF-induced p44/42 MAPK phosphorylation
(Supplementary Fig. 1). Consequently, BDNF increased NPY and Y5R mRNA in SK-NBE(2) NB cells, and Trk antagonist blocked this effect (Fig. 1D). These increases in mRNA
resulted in elevated NPY release and Y5R protein levels in BDNF-treated SK-N-BE(2) cells
(Fig. 1E, F). To confirm this effect, we used a panel of NB cell lines derived from patients
before (CHLA-15, SMS-KCN, SMS-KAN) and after chemotherapy (SK-N-BE(2),
CHLA-20, SMS-KCNR, SMS-KANR).38 Interestingly, the BDNF-induced Y5R upregulation was observed in post-treatment cell lines, while no such effect was detected in
cells derived from patients at diagnosis (Fig. 1G).
In human NB tumors, expression of BDNF and NPY systems positively correlate with each
other

Author Manuscript

mRNA of NPY and BDNF systems were measured by real-time RT-PCR in 75 samples of
NB tissues at diagnosis, a cohort enriched in undifferentiated and poorly differentiated
tumors. These tumor subtypes typically carry a worse prognosis and are subsequently treated
with chemotherapy. NPY and Y2R mRNA were present in all samples, while Y5R mRNA
was detectable in 84% of cases. As summarized in Table 1, significant correlations were
detected by the Pearson coefficient between BDNF and NPY systems, yet the magnitude
and statistical significance of these correlations were dependent on NB differentiation. NPY
mRNA had significant positive correlations with mRNA for both TrkB and BDNF, when all
NB cases were analyzed together. Among NB subtypes, a statistically significant correlation

between NPY and TrkB mRNAs was observed in undifferentiated tumors, while a
correlation between NPY and BDNF mRNAs achieved statistical significance in
differentiating NBs. Correlations between Y5R expression and TrkB and BDNF mRNA
levels were statistically significant in poorly differentiated tumors. Similarly, a significant
association was observed between Y5R and BDNF mRNA levels in differentiating tumors.
This translated to a statistically significant correlation between these two factors in all NB
cases. No statistically significant correlations between Y2R and BDNF system expression
were observed.
BDNF triggers internalization of Y5R

Author Manuscript

There is growing evidence for RTK-GPCR transactivation.39,40 To determine if coordinated
expression of TrkB and Y5R results in such interactions, we transfected SY5Y/TrkB cells
with Y5R cDNA fused to EGFP and used the internalization of Y5R-EGFP as a measure of
its activation. Transfected cells were treated with BDNF, with or without Y5R and Trk
antagonist, and Y5R-EGFP receptor internalization was monitored by time-lapse
fluorescence microscopy. Within 2 min of BDNF stimulation, Y5R was recruited to the cell
membrane and subsequently internalized, as observed 8 min after treatment (Fig. 2A). These
changes were reflected by differences in the ratio of membrane/sub-membrane receptor
fraction (Fig. 2B). No significant changes in Y5R distribution were observed upon pretreatment with Y5R or Trk antagonist (Fig. 2A, B) or in non-treated cells (data not shown).
BDNF-induced internalization of Y5R was confirmed by immunoprecipitation of membrane
proteins. SY5Y/TrkB cells were treated with BDNF and subsequently the surface proteins
were biotinylated, immunoprecipitated and immunoblotted with anti-Y5R antibody. Within
8 min, BDNF triggered the decrease in the cell surface fraction of Y5R, while no statistically
significant effect was observed upon pre-treatment with Y5R or Trk antagonist (Fig. 2C).

Blocking Y5R interferes with BDNF-induced p44/42 MAPK signaling

Author Manuscript

To determine if TrkB-Y5R interactions result in signaling cross-talk, we tested the effects of
their receptor antagonists on the activation of downstream pathways. In SY5Y/TrkB cells,
NPY activated the p44/42 MAPK, but not the Akt pathway (Fig. 3A). Y2R antagonist
blocked NPY-driven p44/42 MAPK phosphorylation, while Y5R and Trk receptor
antagonists had no effect. In contrast, BDNF-induced p44/42 MAPK activation was blocked
by Trk inhibitor and significantly inhibited by Y5R antagonist, while Y2R antagonist had no
effect (Fig. 3A). The BDNF-induced Akt activation was blocked by Trk inhibitor, but
remained unaffected by NPY receptor antagonists. These results were confirmed using NPY
receptor siRNAs. While both Y2R and Y5R siRNAs effectively inhibited their targets
(Supplementary Fig. 2), only Y5R siRNA significantly decreased BDNF-induced p44/42
MAPK activation (Fig. 3B). Similarly, blocking Y5R reduced p44/42 MAPK
phosphorylation triggered by BDNF in native SK-N-BE(2) cells (Fig. 3C), although no
BDNF-induced Akt activation was observed (data not shown).
Y5R contributes to pro-survival effects of BDNF
In SY5Y/TrkB cells cultured under low serum conditions, BDNF increased cell viability
(Fig. 4A). This effect was decreased by Trk inhibitor, and further reduced by a combination
of Trk and Y5R antagonists. Similarly, BDNF rescued NB cells from chemotherapy-induced

cell death. For doxorubicin and vinblastine, the pro-survival effect of BDNF was
significantly, yet partially reduced by TrkB and Y5R antagonists alone, while treatment with
combined antagonists was required for its complete blockage (Fig. 4B, Supplementary Fig.
3). In contrast, Trk inhibitor completely blocked the pro-survival activity of BDNF upon
treatment with etoposide and cisplatin, while Y5R antagonist alone had no effect, suggesting
the prevalence of a Y5R-independent Akt pathway. Nevertheless, in all cases, the
combination of Trk and Y5R antagonist was the most effective and decreased the cell
viability below control levels, indicating a contribution of endogenous BDNF and NPY to
NB survival. These changes in cell viability were accompanied by corresponding changes in
p44/42 MAPK activation (Fig. 4B).

Author Manuscript

The pro-survival effect of BDNF was also observed in native SK-N-BE(2) cells. Upon
cisplatin treatment, BDNF increased cell viability and decreased caspase 3/7 activity,
suggesting inhibition of apoptosis as the mechanism of its actions (Fig. 4C). The prosurvival effect of BDNF in SK-N-BE(2) cells treated with cisplatin and other
chemotherapeutics was completely blocked by Y5R antagonist (Fig. 4C, Supplementary Fig.
4).
NPY system is activated in pro-apoptotic conditions

Author Manuscript

Having determined TrkB-Y5R interactions, we sought to identify other factors activating
Y5R in NB. To this end, SY5Y/TrkB cells were transfected with Y5R siRNA and cultured
under various conditions. Upon 24h culture in low serum media, Y5R siRNA had no effect
on cell survival (Fig. 5A). However, in cells subjected to more severe cellular stress, such as
chemotherapy or serum deprivation for 48h, Y5R knock-down significantly decreased cell
viability. In line with these observations, Y5R protein was not detectable in SY5Y/TrkB
cells cultured in 10% FBS media, while its expression was induced under serum-free
conditions (Fig. 5B), implicating NPY/Y5R axis as an inducible pro-survival pathway.

Author Manuscript

Similarly, activation of the NPY/Y5R axis under cellular stress was observed in nontransfected NB cells expressing low levels of TrkB. In SK-N-BE(2) cells, chemotherapeutics
increased mRNA of NPY and Y5R (Fig. 5C). Consequently, treatment with all compounds
increased NPY release, which resulted in a significantly elevated NPY concentration in
conditioned media from chemotherapy-treated SK-N-BE(2) cells (Fig. 5D). The increase in
Y5R expression was confirmed by Western Blot (Fig. 5E). Trk inhibitor did not block this
effect, suggesting its BDNF-independent regulation (data not shown). As demonstrated for
sensitivity to BDNF, the chemotherapy-induced increase in Y5R expression was detectable
in a panel of cell lines derived from previously treated NB patients, but not in pre-treatment
cells (Fig. 5F).38
NPY exerts pro-survival effects in chemotherapy-treated NB cells
Changes in the NPY system suggested its Y5R-mediated pro-survival activity. Indeed, in
SK-N-BE(2) cells treated with various chemotherapeutics, NPY increased cell viability (Fig.
6A). Y5R antagonist blocked this effect and decreased NB cell survival below baseline,
indicating a pro-survival effect of the endogenous peptide. The NPY-induced increase in cell

viability was associated with reduced caspase 3/7 activity in chemotherapy-treated NB cells,
suggesting the inhibition of apoptosis as the main mechanism of its action (Fig. 6B).
NPY system is up-regulated in post-treatment NB cells
To confirm the clinical relevance of NPY system activation observed upon short-term
treatment, pairs of NB cell lines derived from patients before and after chemotherapy were
compared in terms of NPY system expression.38 On an mRNA level, the treatment-induced
increase in NPY and Y5R expression was observed in CHLA-15/CHLA-20 and SMS-KCN/
SMS-KCNR cell lines, while in the SMS-KAN/SMS-KANR pair, only Y5R mRNA was
elevated (Fig. 7A). In line with RT-PCR results, NPY cellular content was elevated in posttreatment CHLA-20 and SMS-KCNR, but not SMS-KANR cells (Fig. 7B), while Y5R
protein levels were increased in all post-treatment cells (Fig. 7C).

Author Manuscript

To validate findings in the cell lines, we compared Y5R immunostaining in primary NB
tumors derived from non-treated patients and those after chemotherapy. In non-treated
tumors, Y5R expression was observed in single NB cells (an average 30% of positive tumor
cells in undifferentiated and poorly differentiated NBs) (Fig. 7D). In contrast, in
chemotherapy-treated NB tumors, 100% of surviving NB cells was Y5R positive.
Blocking Y5R sensitizes NB cells to chemotherapy

Author Manuscript

Chemotherapy-induced changes in NPY system expression suggested a role for Y5R in NB
chemoresistance. To test the extent and specificity of this effect, we used CHLA-15 and
CHLA-20 cells, a pair of pre- and post-treatment cell lines that are rich in Y5R, but also
express Y2R.29 Cells were treated with increasing doses of chemotherapy in the presence of
Y2R or Y5R antagonist. In both cell lines, blocking Y5R decreased cell viability, while Y2R
inhibitor had no effect (Fig. 8A). These changes were associated with corresponding
increases in caspase 3/7 activity upon Y5R, but not Y2R antagonist treatment (Fig. 8B).
Y5R antagonist inhibits growth of chemoresistant NB cells in vivo
To validate the pro-survival effect of Y5R in vivo, subcutaneous xenografts obtained from
chemoresistant CHLA-20 cells38 were treated with Y5R antagonist. Blocking Y5R resulted
in significant inhibition of CHLA-20 xenograft growth (Fig. 8C), which was associated with
increased tumor cell death (Fig. 8D). No significant changes were observed in NB cell
proliferation or tumor vascularization measured by Ki67 and von Willebrand factor (vWF)
immunostaining, respectively (data not shown).

Discussion
Author Manuscript

BDNF and NPY are important factors in NB biology. BDNF, acting via its TrkB receptor, is
mainly a pro-survival factor for NB cells, protecting them from chemotherapy-induced cell
death, but also promoting angiogenesis and invasiveness.6,7,41 Consequently, high
expression of TrkB in tumor tissue correlates with poor prognosis in NB patients.7,15,17
Similarly, elevated systemic levels of NPY are associated with a poor outcome of NB.19–21
Actions of endogenous NPY mediated by its Y2R are essential to maintain NB cell
proliferation and tumor vascularization.19–21,28,29 However, functions of Y5R, which is also

detectable in some NB cell lines, were not well defined.28 Moreover, despite similar
functions of NPY and BDNF, as well as a known stimulatory effect of BDNF on NPY
synthesis in neurons, interactions of these two systems in NB remained unknown.32–37 Here,
we have shown that BDNF up-regulates the NPY system in NB, which in turn enhances its
pro-survival functions via interactions between TrkB and Y5R receptors.

Author Manuscript

In NB cells, BDNF increased synthesis of NPY and induced expression of its Y5R, while no
consistent up-regulation of Y2R was observed. These results are in agreement with the
presence of binding sites for two transcription factors known to mediate neurotrophins’
effects, AP-1 and CREB, in the promoters of NPY and Y5R, but not Y2R.42,43 Importantly
CREB is activated by p44/42 MAPK, the pathway previously shown to mediate BDNFinduced increase in NPY expression.34,43 The enhanced responsiveness of post-treatment
NB cells to BDNF stimulation could be associated with chemotherapy-induced overexpression of TrkB. We observed a trend toward increased TrkB expression in these cells,
albeit not statistically significant (data not shown).

Author Manuscript

The specificity of BDNF’s stimulatory effect on the NPY system was confirmed by positive
correlations between BDNF/TrkB and NPY/Y5R mRNAs, but not Y2R mRNA, observed in
human NB tissues. The strength of these correlations depended on tumor differentiation
grade, which may be associated with the variability in TrkB and BDNF expression, as well
as in the presence of stromal cells known to release BDNF and regulate NB growth.44–46
Interestingly, the strongest associations of NPY and Y5R levels with BDNF system
expression were observed in different NB subsets, suggesting that other factors differentially
expressed in these tumors modify BDNF actions. Importantly, NPY is highly expressed in
all NB subtypes, while non-treated NBs express Y5R at much lower levels.28,29 Thus, Y5R
expression rather than NPY level is the limiting factor for NPY/Y5R axis activation.
Altogether, our data implicate NPY and Y5R, but not Y2R, as direct BDNF targets.
Expression of Y5R stimulated by BDNF resulted in TrkB-Y5R transactivation and signaling
cross-talk, as demonstrated by Y5R internalization upon BDNF treatment and the decrease
in BDNF-induced p44/42 MAPK activation while Y5R was blocked. Such RTK-GPCR
transactivation has been shown for other receptors and often involves phosphorylation of
GPCRs by RTKs or their signaling mediators, physical interactions between the receptors,
or simultaneous activation of p44/42 MAPK by both receptors.39,40,47–50 Further studies are
required to determine which of these mechanisms mediate TrkB-Y5R interactions.

Author Manuscript

TrkB-Y5R transactivation enhanced BDNF-induced p44/42 MAPK phosphorylation and
augmented its anti-apoptotic effect in chemotherapy-treated NB cells. However, these
interactions did not affect the BDNF-activated PI3K/Akt pathway, suggesting its sole
dependence on TrkB. Such a selective activation of signaling pathways is common for RTKGPCR transactivation and may result from allosteric changes that occur due to receptor
interactions.49,51–54 Our results are in contrast to previous reports implicating the PI3K/Akt
axis as the main pathway mediating pro-survival effects of BDNF in chemotherapy-treated
NB cells.11,12,14 However, the role of p44/42 MAPK in BDNF-induced survival has been
demonstrated in paclitaxel-treated NB cells.13 Similarly, in normal neurons, neuroprotective
actions of BDNF and NPY are largely p44/42 MAPK-mediated.8–10,30 Our results indicate

that BDNF-induced p44/42 MAPK is dependent on TrkB-Y5R transactivation. Such RTKGPCR interactions are regulated by RTK ligand and receptor availability.40,47,55 In cells
expressing high levels of RTKs or exposed to high concentrations of their ligand, no GPCR
involvement is observed and the signaling events solely depend on RTKs. In contrast, the
RTK-GPCR cross-talk is activated in low concentrations of RTK and/or its agonist when the
signal from RTK is not sufficient to trigger the biological response. In line with this,
previous studies demonstrating PI3K/Akt pathway as solely responsible for BDNF’s prosurvival effect relied on TrkB transfectants treated with high doses of neurotrophin (100ng/
ml), while markedly lower concentrations (0.1–1ng/ml) were used in our study.11,12,14
Moreover, we observed no Akt pathway activation in non-transfected NB cells which
express low levels of TrkB, yet respond to BDNF by p44/42 MAPK phosphorylation.
Consequently, the pro-survival effect of BDNF in these cells was completely blocked by
Y5R antagonist. Thus, in agreement with reports on other RTK-GPCR systems, our results
indicate that TrkB-Y5R interactions serve as a rescue system activating p44/42 MAPK and
enhancing pro-survival effects of BDNF when the activation of the BDNF/TrkB axis alone
is not sufficient to protect the cells. Therefore, in NB tumors with low TrkB expression
and/or low BDNF content, the p44/42 MAPK pathway may contribute to their
chemoresistance and become a therapeutic target along with Akt.

Author Manuscript

The TrkB-Y5R transactivation is in agreement with the ability of Y5R to interact with other
receptors. Y5R forms heterodimerms with Y1R, and enhances Y1R-mediated proliferation
of vascular smooth muscle cells in low NPY concentrations.56,57 It also augments functions
of the α1-adrenergic receptor in cardiomyocytes.24,58 Here, we have shown that Y5R
contributed to BDNF-induced, but not NPY-induced, p44/42 MAPK phosphorylation. This
selectivity in Y5R signaling may depend on cellular context, such as the prevalence of Y2R
expression, which binds the majority of NPY and/or high expression of TrkB, which recruits
Y5R to its signaling complex.

Author Manuscript

Aside from BDNF-induced up-regulation of the NPY/Y5R axis, expression of NPY and
Y5R was increased under cellular stress, such as serum deprivation or chemotherapy. As
seen with the response to BDNF, more pronounced up-regulation of the NPY system was
observed in cells derived from chemotherapy-treated NBs. This effect was not blocked by
Trk inhibitor, suggesting BDNF-independent pro-survival activity of the NPY/Y5R
pathway. Indeed, in chemotherapy treated NB cells, NPY increased cell viability in a Y5Rdependent manner. Thus, while after short-term stimulation, such as that used to detect
p44/42 MAPK activation, Y5R predominantly interacts with TrkB, under prolonged cellular
stress it mediates also anti-apoptotic effects of NPY, Importantly, Y5R antagonist decreased
the viability of chemotherapy-treated NB cells in the absence of exogenous survival factors,
confirming the role of endogenous NPY and BDNF. The saturation of NPY receptors with
the autocrine peptide may also explain the modest effect of exogenous NPY in these cells.
The expression of two types of NPY receptors in NB - Y2R and Y5R - raises a question
regarding the specificity of their functions. Previously, we have demonstrated that Y2R is
constitutively expressed in NB cell lines and tumors, as well as in endothelium within tumor
vasculature, and mediates proliferative and angiogenic actions of endogenous NPY.28,29
Here, we demonstrated that Y5R, but not Y2R, is an inducible, pro-survival NPY receptor.

Altogether, our results indicate that actions of Y2R and Y5R in NB depend on the cellular
context. During exponential growth, proliferative and pro-angiogenic actions of Y2R
predominate (Fig. 9A).28,29 However, upon BDNF stimulation and under cellular stress,
Y5R expression is induced and its TrkB-dependent and -independent pro-survival functions
are activated, while Y2R does not play a major role (Fig. 9B, C). Ultimately, the effects of
Y2R and Y5R antagonist on NB growth depend on the balance between tumor cell
proliferation and apoptosis. Interestingly, despite their different biological functions, actions
of both receptors are mediated by p44/42 MAPK. This could result from Y5R interactions
with other receptors, which modify its function, but also from differences in Y2R and Y5R
signaling, since Y2R regulates intracellular Ca++ in addition to the decrease in cAMP
stimulated by both receptors (Fig. 9).59,60

Author Manuscript

The clinical relevance of Y5R activation was confirmed by its expression in all surviving
NB cells within chemotherapy-treated tumors. This phenomenon may result from upregulation of Y5R in all tumor cells or selection of the Y5R-positive NB clones. In vivo,
blocking Y5R increased apoptosis and inhibited growth of xenografts derived from Y5Rrich chemoresistant CHLA-20 cells.38 This apoptotic effect was in agreement with increased
caspase 3/7 activity observed in NB cells treated with Y5R antagonist in vitro. This is in
contrast to anti-proliferative and anti-angiogenic effects of Y2R blockade, which also inhibit
NB xenograft growth.29 Thus, our in vivo data corroborate the proliferative and pro-survival
actions of Y2R and Y5R in NB, respectively. Although in the current study the xenografts
were not treated with chemotherapy, cell death occurs in tumors naturally (e.g. due to
hypoxia). As shown in Ewing sarcoma, these conditions also up-regulate Y5R.61 Further
studies are required to determine if Y5R antagonists, alone or in combination with Y2R
antagonist or Trk inhibitors, have a synergistic effect with chemotherapy in vivo.
Importantly, Y5R antagonist has already been approved for clinical trials for other
disorders.62,63

Author Manuscript

Overall, we present the first evidence for TrkB-Y5R interactions and their contribution to
the anti-apoptotic effect of BDNF. We also demonstrate that Y5R, acting in a BDNFdependent or -independent manner, is a pro-survival factor for NB cells, up-regulated in proapoptotic conditions. Consequently, Y5R blockage increases NB cell death and sensitizes
them to chemotherapy. These findings, along with our previous results implicating Y2R as a
crucial proliferative and pro-angiogenic factor in NB, underscore the importance of the NPY
system in NB biology and validate the peptide and its receptors as therapeutic targets.
Importantly, while the NPY/Y2R axis is active in all NB tumors, implicating Y2R as a
universal therapeutic target, Y5R may be the most relevant to chemoresistant, refractory
NBs that lack an adequate treatment.

Human NB samples

Author Manuscript

mRNA and paraffin-embedded sections from 75 NB cases at diagnosis were obtained from
Children’s Oncology Group, while 4 paraffin-embedded samples from NB tumors upon
induction chemotherapy were collected by Dr. Izycka-Swieszewska in compliance with
institutional regulations. Use of these samples was approved by Georgetown University
Institutional Review Board.
Cell culture

Author Manuscript

Human NB cells – SK-N-BE(2), SH-SY5Y were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA),
SH-SY5Y cells stably transfected with TrkB cDNA (SY5Y/TrkB) from Dr. Brodeur
(University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA)11 and pairs of NB cell lines derived from
patients at diagnosis and during induction chemotherapy – SMS-KCN and SMS-KCNR,
SMS-KAN and SMS-KANR, CHLA-15 and CHLA-20 - from Dr. Reynolds (Children’s
Hospital of Los Angeles, CA).38 Cells were cultured according to the suppliers’
recommendation.
Real time RT-PCR and NPY ELISA were performed as previously described.28,64

Author Manuscript

Western blot for NPY receptors was performed on membrane proteins isolated as previously
described,65 using goat polyclonal anti-Npy2r (My Biosource, Camarillo, CA) and anti-Y5R
(Everest Biotech, Ramona, CA) antibodies, while unspecific protein staining (Pierce
Reversible Protein Stain Kit for Nitrocellulose Membranes, Thermo, Rockford, IL) served
as a loading control. Signaling molecules were detected in whole cell extracts using the
following antibodies: mouse monoclonal anti-phospho p44/42 E10, rabbit polyclonal antiphospho Akt Thr308 and Ser473 (Cell Signaling Technology, Boston, MA) and mouse
monoclonal anti-β-actin (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). Densitometry was conducted using ImageJ
software.
Y5R-EGFP transfections and live cell imaging
Human Y5R cDNA was cloned into pEGFP-N1 vector (Clontech Laboratories, Mountain
View, CA) and transfected into SY5Y/TrkB cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Life
Techonologies, Grand Island, NY). Transfected cells were imaged 24h later with a Zeiss 510
LSM/META confocal microscope during 30 min incubation with BDNF (1ng/ml), with or
without 15 min pre-incubation with Y5R or Trk antagonist (10−6M). Fluorescence
intensities on the cell membrane and in the sub-membrane areas were measured using
ImageJ software. For the analysis, multiple cellular regions with initial membrane Y5REGFP localization (membrane/sub-membrane fluorescence ratio ≥ 1.3) were selected.

Cell surface protein immunoprecipitation
SY5Y/TrkB cells were pre-incubated for 24h in serum-free media and treated for 8 min with
BDNF (1ng/ml), with or without 15 min pre-treatment with TrkB or Y5R antagonists
(10−6M). Then, cell surface proteins were biotynylated and immunoprecipitated using Cell
Surface Protein Isolation Kit (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL). Y5R in cell lysates and
immunoprecipitation eluates was detected by Western blot.

Cell viability and apoptosis assays

Author Manuscript

Cells plated in 96-well plates were cultured in 1% FBS media for 24h and treated as desired.
After 24h, the number of viable cells was measured using MTS-based CellTiter
96®AQueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay, while caspase activity was measured
using Apo-ONE Homogenous Caspase 3/7 reagent (Promega, Madison, WI).
siRNA transfection
SY5Y/TrkB cells were transfected with 30nM Y2R or negative control siRNA (Life
Technologies, Grand Island, NY), as previously described29 or with Y5R siGENOME
SMART pool siRNA (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL) using Trans IT-TKO (Mirus,
Madison, WI). 48h later, knockdown efficiency was tested by Western blot, while cell
viability and signaling pathway activation were assessed as above.

NB xenografts
107 of CHLA-20 cells suspended in 0.1ml of Matrigel (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) were
injected subcutaneously into the dorsal flank of 4–6 weeks old female nude mice. When
tumors reached a volume of 100mm3, daily treatment with local injections of Y5R
antagonist (10−6M, 0.1ml) was initiated. Mice were euthanized once tumors reached a
volume of approximately 1cm3. This study was approved by an Institutional Animal Care
and Use Committee of the Georgetown University.
Tissue analyses

Author Manuscript

Immunohistochemistry was performed using the following rabbit polyclonal antibodies:
anti-Y5R (Novus Biologicals, LLC, Littleton, CO), anti-Ki67 (Abcam, Cambridge, MA) and
anti-vWF (DAKO, Carpinteria, CA). Cell death was detected by TUNEL (Roche,
Indianapolis, IN). All tissues were assessed by a pathologist. Staining area was quantified
using ImageJ software.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were performed using SigmaStat®, GraphPad and SPSS software.
Between-group comparisons were assessed using one-way or two-way repeated measures
ANOVA with post-hoc t-test, independent-samples t-tests or paired-samples t-tests, as
appropriate. Significant associations were assessed at an alpha level of 0.05. All experiments
were repeated at least three times. Data is presented as mean ± standard errors. Bivariate
associations are reported using the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient.

Sequential images of representative cells are shown. B. Levels of membrane and submembrane Y5R content were quantified based on fluorescence intensities in the
corresponding sub-cellular regions. Multiple regions with the initial membrane localization
of Y5R (membrane/sub-membrane fluorescence ratio ≥ 1.3) from at least three
independently treated cells per group were analyzed. C. SY5Y/TrkB cells were treated for 8
min with BDNF (1ng/ml) in the presence or absence of Y5R or Trk antagonists at
concentrations 10−6M. Membrane proteins were then biotinylated and selectively
immunoprecipitated. The fraction of Y5R present on the cell surface was detected by
Western blot in immunoprecipitation eluates and normalized to Y5R levels in the original
cell lysates. The results of three independent experiments were quantified by densitometry.

Figure 9. Proposed mechanisms of BDNF and NPY interactions and functions in NB cells

Author Manuscript

A. Under growth promoting conditions, NPY and Y2R are constitutively expressed in NB
cells. This NPY/Y2R autocrine loop stimulates NB cell proliferation via p44/42 MAPK
activation. This effect is most likely triggered by signaling events known to mediate Y2R
actions – changes in intracellular Ca++ and decrease in cAMP levels. B. BDNF, a known
survival factor for NB cells, stimulates the synthesis of NPY and induces expression of its
Y5R. This effect is mediated by p44/42 MAPK and CREB. Expression of NPY and its Y5R
is further up-regulated under cellular stress, such as serum deprivation or chemotherapy, in a
BDNF-independent manner. C. Induction of Y5R expression in pro-apoptotic conditions
activates its pro-survival actions. Upon BDNF stimulation, its receptor, TrkB, transactivates
Y5R, which augments BDNF-induced p44/42 MAPK activation and its anti-apoptotic effect.
TrkB-Y5R interactions do not affect BDNF-induced Akt activation. Y5R, acting via p44/42
MAPK, also mediates the pro-survival effect of NPY. This effect could be initiated by a
decrease in cAMP levels, a signaling event triggered upon NPY/Y5R axis activation. Solid
boxes – molecules tested in the current study; dashed boxes – unknown factors; no outline –
molecules previously implicated in BDNF or NPY signaling in NB.
