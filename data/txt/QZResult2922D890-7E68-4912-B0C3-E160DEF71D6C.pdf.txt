Abstract
Agonist monoclonal antibodies (mAb) to the immune costimulatory molecule CD137, also known as 4-1BB,
are presently in clinical trials for cancer treatment on the basis of their costimulatory effects on primed T cells
and perhaps other cells of the immune system. Here we provide evidence that CD137 is selectively expressed on
the surface of tumor endothelial cells. Hypoxia upregulated CD137 on murine endothelial cells. Treatment of
tumor-bearing immunocompromised Rag/ mice with agonist CD137 mAb did not elicit any measurable
antiangiogenic effects. In contrast, agonist mAb stimulated tumor endothelial cells, increasing cell surface
expression of the adhesion molecules intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1, vascular cell adhesion molecule
(VCAM)-1, and E-selectin. When adoptively transferred into mice, activated T lymphocytes derived from CD137deficient animals entered more avidly into tumor tissue after treatment with agonist mAb. This effect could be
neutralized with anti–ICAM-1 and anti–VCAM-1 blocking antibodies. Thus, stimulation of CD137 not only
enhanced T-cell activation but also augmented their trafficking into malignant tissue, through direct actions on
the blood vessels that irrigate the tumor. Our findings identify an additional mechanism of action that can
explain the immunotherapeutic effects of agonist CD137 antibodies. Cancer Res; 71(3); 801–11. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
CD137 (4-1BB, TNFRSF9) is a surface glycoprotein involved
in T-cell costimulation (1–3). It was first described as a
molecule selectively expressed on activated, but not resting,
T lymphocytes (1–3). More recently, its expression has been
documented on activated natural killer (NK) cells (4), dendritic cells (5), and other leukocytes such as mast cells (6),
activated B lymphocytes, (7) and bone marrow myeloid precursors (8). The stimulatory effects of this receptor are elicited
on interaction with the only described cognate ligand
(CD137L, 41BBL, or TNFSF9) whose expression seems to be
restricted to activated antigen presenting cells such as dendritic cells, macrophages, and B cells (1).

While investigating genes whose expression was related to
oncological angiogenesis, as opposed to the angiogenesis that
occurs in nonmalignant tissue regeneration, it was found that
mouse CD137 RNA probes were a selective marker of tumor
related angiogenesis (9). Indeed, immunohistochemical evidence for CD137 expression on human malignant tumor
capillaries had been previously obtained by the group of H.
Schwarz (10). Moreover, evidence of expression of CD137 on
the endothelial lining of atherosclerotic lesions in mice has
been published (11).
Agonist monoclonal antibodies (mAb) directed to antiCD137 or multivalent RNA aptamers binding CD137 (12) have
been shown to therapeutically enhance antitumor CD8 T-cell–
mediated immunity in mice (3, 13–15). Interestingly, treatment with agonist anti-CD137 mAb can overcome tumor
antigen tolerance (16) in a number of models and more
importantly, can be successfully combined with both other
immunotherapeutic strategies (17–20) and conventional
immune-unrelated treatment approaches (17, 21). Some of
those combinations attain extraordinary therapeutic activity
in mouse models (22). For these reasons anti-human CD137
agonist mAb are undergoing phase I/phase II clinical trials
(17). Paradoxically, similar antibody agents ameliorate autoimmune model diseases in mice (23–25) mainly because of
interfering with autoreactive CD4 T cells (23, 24, 26). The only
described inflammatory complication in mice treated with
agonist anti-CD137 mAb are moderate liver infiltrates in
which polyclonal CD8 T cells predominate (27, 28).

The mechanism of action has been interpreted in the sense
that a stronger CD8 T-cell–mediated immune response is
artificially costimulated in treated animals (3, 13, 29). Direct
stimulation of the CD137 receptor on T cells is definitely
involved in the immunotherapeutic effects, but the interaction
of the agonist antibodies with CD137 expressed on the surface
of activated NK cells (15, 30) and dendritic cells (5) can also be
of importance (3).
If CD137 were expressed at the protein level on tumor
endothelial cells, treatment with anti-CD137 mAb could signal
into the vascular cells. We hypothesized that if CD137 signaled
in the same way as in T cells via TNF receptor associated
factor (TRAF) adaptors (1, 31, 32) toward NF-kB (31, 32),
proinflammatory molecules could be induced. Among them,
receptors that would increase T-cell homing to tumors, such
as intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1, vascular cell
adhesion molecule (VCAM)-1, and E-selectin, were postulated
to be involved (33).
Our experiments show that adoptively transferred activated
CD137-deficient T cells enter more avidly into tumor lesions
as a result of enhanced expression of homing receptors on
endothelial cells that have received direct stimulation via their
surface CD137.

Material and Methods
Mice and cell lines
BALB/c wild-type (WT) mice (5–6 weeks old) were purchased
from Harlan Laboratories. Rag/ mice (BALB/c and C57BL/6)
and MMTV-neuT mice (34) were purchased from the Jackson
Laboratory and bred in our animal facility under specific
pathogen-free conditions. CD137 knockout mice were generated at Lexicon Genetics. To generate CD137/ mice, 129/Svderived embryonic stem (ES) cells (Lex1) were electroporated
with a targeting construct that replaced the entire coding region
of CD137 (exons 2–5) with a lacZneo fusion cassette (Supplementary Fig. S2). ES cells that survived neomycin selection (300
mg/mL) were amplified and split into several aliquots. From
several hundred ES cell clones, 6 clones were identified that had
the proper recombination events at the 50 (internal probe) and
30 ends (external probe; Supplementary Fig. S2A). One of these
clones (IE7) was injected into C57BL/6J blastocysts and yielded
chimeric male offspring that were able to pass the CD137
disruption through the germline after mating with C57BL/6J
females. The resulting germline mice were of mixed (C57BL/6J
 129/Sv) background and were expanded as a mixed population for several generations prior to being subjected to speedbackcrossing (using microsatellite markers for BALB/c mice at
Charles River Laboratories) for 5 generations to yield mice that
were more than 99% BALB/c character. An additional 2 backcrosses were made to inbred BALB/c mice prior to expansion
for use in these experiments. Because the entire coding region
for CD137 is missing from these mice, there is no CD137 mRNA
nor protein present in them (Supplementary Fig. S2B).
All animal procedures were conducted under institutional
guidelines that comply with national laws and policies.
The murine endothelial cell line PY-4-1 was kindly provided
by V. Bautch (University of North Carolina; ref. 35). The mouse

802

coronary endothelial cells were purified and immortalized by
A. Luque (36). In brief, endothelial cells were isolated by
positive selection using platelet/endothelial cell adhesion
molecule-1 or ICAM-2 (37) antibodies bound to magnetic
beads (Dynabeads, Invitrogen). Subconfluent primary cultures
were incubated in the presence of polybrene (8 mg/mL; Sigma)
with supernatant from packaging cells producing recombinant retroviruses that transduced polyoma middle T antigen
(virus concentration, approximately 10–200 pfu/cell).
CT26, EMT6, and Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) tumor cell
lines (38) were from ATCC, and authenticated and quality
controlled by the services of the cell bank at Bristol-Myers
Squibb by DNA testing. Cells were cultured in complete RPMI
medium [RPMI 1640 with Glutamax (Gibco, Invitrogen) containing 10% heat-inactivated FBS (Sigma-Aldrich), 100 IU/mL
penicillin and 100 mg/mL streptomycin (Biowhittaker), and 5
 105 mol/L 2-mercaptoethanol (Gibco)]. For hypoxic culture conditions, serum-starved PY-4-1 cells, McoECs, and lung
primary endothelial cells were incubated for the indicated
times under 1% O2 atmosphere in a modular incubator
chamber (Billups-Rothenberg Inc.).
Primary endothelial cells were isolated from lungs of
C57BL/6 mice by collagenase digestion followed by selection
using Dynabeads Sheep anti-rat IgG (Invitrogen) coupled to a
rat anti-mouse ICAM-2 (BD Pharmingen).
In vivo tumor growth and microPET analysis
A total of 0.5  106 CT26, EMT-6, and LLC cells were
injected in 100 mL PBS subcutaneously in the flank. Mice
were sacrificed when tumor sizes reached 150 mm2. Positron
emission tomography (PET) analyses showing tumor hypoxia
in CT26 established tumors with the radiotracer fluorine-18fluoromisonidazole (18FMISO) synthesized as described (39).
Mice were injected with 18F-FMISO (14.9  4.9 MBq in 100
mL) in the tail vein. Four hours later, a static 30-minute study
(sinogram) was acquired using a Mosaic (Philips) small animal
dedicated imaging tomography with 11.9-cm axial field of view
(FOV), 12.8-cm transaxial FOV and a 2-mm resolution.
For the assessment of tumor 18F-FMISO uptake, all studies
were exported and analyzed using the PMOD software (PMOD
Technologies Ltd.). Regions of interest were drawn on coronal
1-mm-thick small-animal PET images on consecutive slices
including the entire tumor. Finally, maximum standardized
uptake value (SUV) was calculated for each tumor using the
formula: SUV ¼ [tissue activity concentration (Bq/cm3)/
injected dose (Bq)]  body weight (g).
Flow cytometry, antibodies, and tissue
immunofluorescence
For flow cytometry analysis of tumor endothelial cells, we
placed cleanly excised tumor nodules in Petri dishes and
minced them finely with a scalpel blade, and incubated them
for 45 minutes at 37o C in a solution containing Collagenase-D
and DNAse-I (Roche) in RPMI. We then took the entire
material and passed it through a 70-mm cell strainer (BD
Falcon, BD Bioscience) pressing with a plunger, to obtain
unicellular cell suspensions. Single cell suspensions were
pretreated with FcR-Block (anti-CD16/32 clon 2.4G2; BD

Pharmingen). Afterwards, cells were stained with the following antibodies or reagents obtained from BD Pharmingen:
CD34-FITC, CD31-PE, CD45.2-APC, CD137-biotin, Syrian
Hamster Isotype control-biotin, ICAM-1-biotin, VCAM-1-biotin, E-selectin-biotin, Rat IgG2a, and RatIgG2b biotin conjugated isotype controls. Biotin-conjugated primary antibodies
were detected with Streptavidine-APC-Cy7 and 40 ,6 diamidino
2 phenylindole was used for dead cell exclusion. Other antibodies used were CD3-FITC, CD8-APC, CD137-PE, and Syrian
Hamster Isotype control-PE (BD Pharmingen).
FACS-Canto II and FACSCalibur (BD-Biosciences) were
used for cell acquisition and data analysis was carried out
using FlowJo software (Tree Star Inc.). For sorting, a FACSARIA (BD-Biosciences) was used.
The agonist mouse CD137 clone 1D8 was produced in
Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. The heavy and light chain
genes for mAb 1D8 were cotransfected into DG44CHO cells
maintained in protein-free CHO media (Sigma-Aldrich). Purified anti-CD137 mAb was certified to have less than 0.5 EU/
mg endotoxin level, more than 95% purity, and less than 5%
high molecular weight species (Bristol-Myers Squibb). Stock
solutions of anti-CD137 mAb were kept at 80 C and were
thawed on ice prior to use. Polyclonal rat immunoglobulin G
(IgG) lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-free was purchased from
Sigma (<0.5 EU/mg endotoxin confirmed in our hands).
M-450 tosylactivated Dynabeads (Dynal) coupled with 1D8
anti-CD137 mAb or Rat IgG were used for in vitro stimulation
of endothelial cells. Antibody coupling to the microbeads was
done following the manufacturer's instructions.
Tissue immunofluorescence staining was performed on 10mm thick cryosections with the following antibodies: anti–
ICAM-1-AF647 and anti–VCAM-1-AF647 (Biolegend), CD31PE (BD Pharmingen), and goat anti-CD137 (R&D Systems)
followed by anti-goat AF488 (Invitrogen) antibody in the
second step to visualize the antigen. For confocal microscopy,
LSM 510 META (Carl Zeiss) equipment was used. The images
were analyzed using Zeiss LSM Image Browser software.
Directed in vivo angiogenesis assay
Angiogenic responses were compared and quantitated as
described previously (40).
In brief, this assay consists of subcutaneous implantation of
semiclosed silicone cylinders (angioreactors) filled with CT26
tumor cells embedded in Matrigel (BD Biosciences; Supplementary Fig. S3A). Vascularization within angioreactors was
quantified 11 days later by the intravenous injection of the
intravascular contrast fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-dextran, followed by spectrofluorimetry on the Matrigel from
excised angioreactors (Supplementary Fig. S3B and C). As a
positive control of angiogenesis inhibition, the compound
77427 was used (40).
Molecular analyses
Total RNA was extracted from tumor endothelial cells
sorted by FACS-Aria (BD Biosciences) using RNAsy Mini
Kit (Qiagen). We treated RNA with DNaseI (Gibco-BRL) prior
to reverse transcription with Moloney murine leukemia virus
(MMLV) reverse transcriptase (Gibco-BRL) in the presence of

www.aacrjournals.org

RNaseOUT (Gibco-BRL). Real-time PCR was done with iQ
SYBR green supermix in an iQ5 real-time PCR detection
system (Bio-Rad). Copy numbers of CD137 DNA were quantified by quantitative RT-PCR with primers annealing the
mouse CD137 cDNA (forward primer: 50 -AACATCTGCAGAGTGTGTGC-30 , reverse primer: 50 -AGACCTTCCGTCTAGAGAGC-30 , product length: 252 bp). PCR amplification
was done under the following conditions: 1 cycle of 3 minutes
at 95 C; followed by 45 cycles of 30 seconds at 95 C, 15 seconds
at 60 C, 30 seconds at 72 C, 25 seconds at 77 C, 10 seconds at
84 C, and 30 seconds at 85 C (detection temperature of 84 C);
followed by a single final extension cycle of 72 C for 3 minutes.
Immediately after the PCR, a melting curve was generated by
raising the incubation temperature from 55 C to 95 C to
confirm amplification specificity. The final PCR product
was also analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Samples
were analyzed in duplicate and data were normalized by
comparison with b-actin as an internal control (forward
primer: 50 -CGCGTCCACCCGCGAG-30 , reverse primer: 50 CCTGGTGCCTAGGGCG-30 , product length: 194 bp). The
amount of each transcript was expressed according to the
formula 2Ct (b-actin)  Ct(CD137), in which Ct is the point at which
the fluorescence increases appreciably above background
fluorescence. Primers for amplification of the 2 mCD137 isoforms are 50 -TGTGTGCAGGCTATTTCAGG-30 and 50 GAGCTGCTCCAGTGGTCTTC-30 (35 cycles of 30 seconds at
95 C, 30 seconds at 60 C, 30 seconds at 72 C) with a 2720
Thermal Cycler (Applied Biosystems) and BioTaq DNA Polymerase (Bioline). Isoform 1 product length: 504 bp; isoform 2
product length: 369 bp. PCR products were visualized with
SYBR Safe (Invitrogen) after electrophoresis on 1% agarose gels.
Adoptive T-cell transfers
Total splenocytes from CD137/ donor mice were activated
with Con-A (10 mg/mL; Sigma), labeled with carboxyfluorescein
succinimidyl ester (CFSE) 2.5 mmol/L and inoculated intravenously (107 T cells per mouse) into Rag/ recipient mice
carrying CT26 ﬂank tumors that had an approximate volume of
100 mm2.
We treated recipient mice with anti-CD137 1D8 (100 mg per
mouse) or LPS-free NA/LE Rat IgG as control for 48 hours
before T-cell transfer. In some experiments, we treated mice i.
p. with a neutralizing antibody against mouse ICAM-1 (50 mg
per mouse, clone YN1/1.7.4; Biolegend) and against mouse
VCAM-1 (50 mg per mouse, clone M/K-1.9). We harvested
tumors 48 hours after T-cell transfer, and analyzed them for
CFSE and CD8-APC in a FACS Canto II flow cytometer.
Absolute numbers of infiltrating T cells were calculated and
referred to the total number of lymphocytes counted per cell
suspension (Z1 Coulter Particle Counter, Beckman Coulter).
Statistical analysis
Prism software (Graph Pad Software) was used to analyze
the quantitative PCRs, directed in vivo angiogenesis assay,
adhesion molecule induction and tumor infiltration data, and
to determine statistical significance of the differences between
groups by applying unpaired Student's t tests or 2- way
ANOVA tests. P < 0.05 was considered significant.

Results
CD137 protein is expressed on endothelial cells in
mouse tumors
To ascertain whether CD137 protein was present on tumor
endothelial cells, a multicolor staining strategy was performed
on unicellular suspensions obtained from syngeneic tumors
grafted in mice. Supplementary Figure S1 shows the strategy
to gate CD45CD31þCD34þ. When those cells from CT26
colon carcinomas were costained with anti-CD137 mAb, surface expression was indeed observed. Such costaining was
preserved when tumor cells were grafted in T- and B-cell–
deficient immunodeficient Rag/ mice (Fig. 1A). To ensure

Moreover, when such CD45CD34þCD31þ endothelial cells

were thoroughly sequenced to confirm CD137 identity (data
not shown).
To rule out the possibility that this was a feature exclusive
to CT26-derived tumors implanted in BALB/c mice, we conducted similar experiments with grafts of LLC and EMT6
breast carcinoma implanted in C57BL6 and BALB/c mice
respectively. In these tumors, specific immunostaining was
also documented with anti-CD137 mAb. (Fig. 1C). Moreover,
expression of CD137 was found on the CD45CD31þCD34þ
cells from spontaneous breast carcinomas (Fig. 1C) arising in
MMTV-HER-2 transgenic mice (34). Therefore, the expression
of CD137 on endothelium is not an exclusive characteristic of
transplanted tumors.
In surgically excised CT26 tumors, it was possible to document by tissue immunofluorescence under confocal microscopy that most CD31þ cells in vascular structures are
costained with anti-CD137 further confirming the presence
of CD137 in tumor-associated vascular endothelium (Fig. 1D).
Hypoxia induces CD137 on mouse endothelial cells
The expression of CD137 on mouse endothelial cells from
tumors raised the question of which microenvironmental
factor would drive CD137 expression. Tumors constitute a
hypoxic tissue as we observe in CT26 established tumors using
a PET technique that visualizes hypoxia as a result of FMISO
retention (Fig. 2A). We found that the endothelioma cell line
PY-4-1(35) does not express surface CD137. However, if these
cells are cultured for 24 hours in a 1% O2 hypoxia chamber,
immunostaining with anti-CD137 mAbs becomes apparent
(Fig. 2B). PY-4-1 is derived from hemangiomas arising in SV40
T transgenic mice. To check whether this could be seen in
other mouse endothelial cells, a cell line immortalized in
culture from coronary endothelium by SV40 T Ag transfection
(42) was used rendering similar results (Fig. 2C). Induction of
CD137 expression took place at the transcriptional level as it
could be observed in quantitative RT-PCRs (Fig. 2D).
However, it could be argued that CD137 upregulation in
response to hypoxia might be caused by the transformed
nature of the endothelial cell lines used in Figure 2. To exclude
this interpretation, experiments were done on short-passaged
primary endothelial cells isolated from mouse lungs that
showed upregulation of surface CD137 (Fig. 3A) and CD137
mRNA (Fig. 3B) in response to hypoxia.
Lack of antiangiogenic effects of anti-CD137 mAb
Our findings on selectively CD137 expression on tumor
endothelium suggested that perhaps part of the therapeutic
effects of anti-CD137 mAb could be attributed to antiangiogenesis or other effects on tumor vascularization.
However, when mice were implanted with mm-sized tubes
filled with CT26 cells embedded in Matrigel, anti-CD137
treatment showed a degree of vascularization similar to that
found with control antibody. These experiments shown in
Supplementary Figure S3 were done in Rag/ mice to rule out
any indirect effects mediated by CD8þ T cells. The method for
vascularization analysis was based on measuring an intravascular fluorescent dye inside the excised Matrigel tubes. The
amount of vascularization of the Matrigel implants was

antiangiogenic drug 77427 (40) used as a positive control.
CD137 ligation on endothelial cells increases
expression of lymphocyte-homing adhesion molecules
An attractive hypothesis was that if CD137 on endothelial
cells were coupled to the same signal transduction machinery
as in T-cells, this could drive proinflammatory changes.
Indeed, when PY-4-1 endothelioma cells were cultured under
hypoxia and treated with 4.5-mm diameter microbeads coated
with the agonist anti-CD137 mAb 1D8, expression of E-selectin, VCAM-1, and ICAM-1 were upregulated (Fig. 4A; Supplementary Fig. S4). Agonist anti-CD137 antibody-coated
microbeads were chosen to mimic cells expressing CD137L.
If these mechanisms occurred in vivo, the expression of
adhesion molecules could facilitate infiltration of T lymphocytes into tissues. To verify whether this mechanism was
actually at work in vivo, experiments in BALB/c mice grafted
with CT26 tumors were done. Accordingly, mice with 10-mm
mean diameter tumors were treated with 1D8 anti-CD137
mAb or control rat IgG. Both antibodies were devoid of LPS. As
can be seen in Figure 4B, the immunostaining in

dramatically increased. To exclude events related to T cells
and to ensure that the observations were due to CD137
ligation, experiments were carried out in Rag/ and
CD137/ mice. Figure 4C shows that no upregulation took

806

Cancer Res; 71(3) February 1, 2011

place in CD137/ mice, but upregulation was readily seen in
T/B-cell–deficient Rag/ mice.
Confocal microscopy examination of tumor tissue samples
from Rag/ mice treated with anti-CD137 mAb showed
ICAM-1 and VCAM-specific immunofluorescence associated
to capillary walls (Fig. 4D).
Our interpretation is that ligation of CD137 on mouse
tumor endothelial cells gives rise to signals that enhance
the expression of lymphocyte homing molecules.
Treatment with anti-CD137 mAb increases T-cell
homing into tumors as a result of a direct stimulation
of endothelial cells
The next question was to ascertain whether CD137 upregulation of homing receptors on endothelial cells actually gave
rise to enhanced intratumoral infiltration of activated T
lymphocytes.
For this purpose, as depicted in Figure 4A, Con-A T-cell
blasts were prepared from the spleen of CD137/ syngenic
mice (Supplementary Fig. S2) and labeled with CFSE. Rag/
mice harboring CT26 tumors were used as recipients for the
CD137/ Con-A T-cell blasts. Mice had been pretreated with
anti-CD137 mAb or control antibody as presented in the
scheme (Fig. 5A).
As seen in Figure 5B, many more fluorescent cells were
recovered from unicellular suspensions of the CT26 tumors
2 days later on treatment with anti-CD137 mAb. Given that the
antitumor immunotherapeutic effects of anti-CD137 mAb are
mostly attributed to CD8 T cells, it was also important to verify
that CD8þ CFSEþ T cells entered more avidly into the tumor
tissue as shown in Figure 5C. Similar data have been observed
in LLC tumors transfected to express ovalbumin when transferring anti-OVA TCR transgenic CD8þ T cells (Supplementary
Fig. S5) indicating that tumor antigen-specific T cells can also
enter more efficiently to tumors under treatment with antiCD137 mAb. Other groups have also reported enhanced
entrance of tumor antigen-specific T cells on anti-CD137
mAb treatment (43)
In the experiments shown in Figure 5B and C, we observed
that pretreatment of the mice with a mixture of anti–ICAM-1
and anti–VCAM-1 blocking mAbs almost completely blocked
the entrance of CD137/ fluorescent T-cell blasts.

Discussion
Traffic of T cells into tumors is a limiting factor for the
efficacy of immunotherapy that can spoil the results of cancer
vaccines and adoptive T-cell therapies even in the cases when
tangible cellular immune responses are present in peripheral
blood (44). Local proinflammatory cytokines (45) including
TNFa, IFNg, interleukin (IL)-1, and CD40 ligation (46) enhance
the expression of homing receptors for activated T lymphocytes on endothelial cells. In this study, we found that CD137
protein and mRNA are functionally expressed by endothelial
cells harvested from mouse solid tumors. Importantly, CD137
ligation on tumor endothelial cells triggers proinflammatory
changes in the tumor vasculature that recruit T cells toward
malignant tissue.

Previous reports had advanced evidence for the expression
of CD137 on vascular cells. This includes human tumor vessels
(10) and inflamed atherosclerotic lesions (11, 47). Immunohistochemical evidence for CD137 expression in capillaries
from a number of human malignant tumors had been
reported, although benign neoplasms tended to show no
anti-CD137 immunostaining in vessels (10). In mice, CD137encoding mRNA has been found in mouse tumor endothelial
cells purified by multistep immunomagnetic procedures from
tumor vessels, but not from angiogenic vascular cells obtained
from regenerating liver (9). In this study, we provide evidence
for functional protein expression at the tumor endothelial cell
surface. Expression of CD137 on mouse tumor vessels seems
to be a common feature that includes a variety of transplantable tumors and spontaneous carcinomas arising in oncogene transgenic mice.
The tumor microenviroment is known to be hypoxic, as we
confirm by PET imaging (39). Hypoxia controls many phenotypic features of endothelial cells. Thus, it could be hypothesized that CD137 expression on endothelial cells could be
driven by hypoxia. We have observed that mouse endothelial
cells subjected to hypoxia expressed surface CD137, whereas it
was absent in normoxic conditions of culture. When analyzing
the locus of mouse CD137 (GenBank accession number
NC_000070), we have identified several putative hypoxia

response elements. The focus of our currently ongoing
research (A. Palazon and colleagues, manuscript in preparation) is to specifically explore the role of hypoxia in controlling
CD137 expression in immune and nonimmune cells. The fact
that CD137 is not expressed in a normoxic atmosphere
indicates that CD137 would be selectively upregulated in
tissues suffering lack of oxygen supply such as the tumor
microenvironment, healing wounds, ischemia-atheroscerosis
conditions. Therefore, the importance of these findings goes
beyond tumor immunotherapy. The nature of the CD137Lþ
cells that would naturally stimulate CD137 on the hypoxic
endothelial cells remains elusive, but in atherosclerotic lesions
has been proposed to be a subset of activated macrophages
(47).
Two important conclusions can be drawn from selective
expression in tumor vessels: (i) the tumor endothelium would
offer CD137 as a selective marker for targeted therapies, and
(ii) selective tissue distribution would confine the vascular
effects of CD137-stimulation inside the malignancy, thereby
avoiding systemic side effects.
Our series of angiogenesis assessments concluded that
there were no detectable antiangiogenic effects in vivo by
the anti-CD137 mAb. This was consistent with previous results
measuring angiogenesis in nude mice implanted with Matrigel
plugs containing VEGF and b-FGF (data not shown). In

CD137 Triggers Tumor Vessels for T-Cell Homing

addition, anti-CD137 mAb have never induced any tumor
shrinkage when tumors are implanted in T-cell–deficient
mice. For this reason, our angiogenesis experiments have
been carried out in Rag/ to avoid any antivascularization
effects indirectly mediated by lymphocytes whose function
was going to be otherwise enhanced via CD137. According to
these negative results, the primary therapeutic effects of antiCD137 mAb cannot be attributed to downregulation of angiogenesis or vasculogenesis.
What we have observed is that CD137 cross-linking at the
surface of endothelial cells gives rise to upregulated expression of VCAM-1, ICAM-1, and E-selectin. These observations
are consistent with previous findings in atherosclerotic
lesions in mice on treatment with anti-CD137 mAb (11).
These homing molecules acting in a concerted fashion with
chemokines are key mediators in the recruitment of an
inflammatory infiltrate (33). Primed lymphocytes bear activated LFA-1 and VLA-4 integrins that would avidly interact
with their counter-receptors, thereby to mediate extravasation. Contrary to what happens with CD40 or proinflammatory cytokine receptors, CD137 is selectively expressed on
tumor vasculature and thus the observed proinflammatory
changes ought to take place selectively at the tumor lesion.
However, these proadhesive effects of agonist anti-CD137
mAb can also occur in atherosclerotic lesions (11) and
therefore attention must be paid to cardiovascular events
in clinical trials, particularly when considering patients with
vascular risk factors.
The ICAM-1 and VCAM-mediated enhanced entrance of
lymphocytes into tumors could define an additional antitumor mechanism of action of the immunostimulatory antiCD137 mAb. Such a mechanism would not be alternative, but
complementary to the costimulatory effects of the anti-CD137
agonist antibodies on T cells. The vascular effects could be
considered an independent mechanism of action, as we
observed migration of CD137/ activated lymphocytes that
are unresponsive to the agonist anti-CD137 mAb.
We had found a similar antitumoral mechanism of action
depending on VCAM upregulation by confining IL-12 expression to tumor nodules by means of gene therapy (48, 49).
Because agonist antibodies directed to OX40, CD27, and GITR
exert immunotherapeutic effects (17), it would be of much
interest to ascertain whether any of these members of the
TNF-receptor family with homology with CD137 are also
functionally expressed, at least in some cases, on tumor
endothelial cells. If this is the case, agonist mAb against such
molecules could share to some extent this mechanism of
action.
In the case of CD137-targeted therapies, a multilayered
mechanism of action emerges in which actions on immune
cells and endothelium could synergistically contribute to the
therapeutic effects. We postulate that vascular and immune
mechanisms may act in a mutually cooperative manner, as
the most intensely activated lymphocytes will be selectively
recruited by adhesion molecules elicited at the lumen of
blood vessels irrigating tumor lesions. In turn, the growing
T-cell infiltrate costimulated via CD137 would further
enhance local inflammation by more intensely producing

www.aacrjournals.org

chemokines and proinflammatory cytokines. In this regard,
the effects on tumor endothelium contribute to explain the
observed synergies of anti-CD137 mAb treatment with cancer vaccines (17, 18) and adoptive transfers of activated T
cells (19, 50).
Our data are very much in agreement with recent elegant
experiments by the group of L. Chen (50) with mouse bone
marrow chimeras that advocate an involvement of a CD137expressing nonhematopoietic cell component in the therapeutic mechanism of action of anti-CD137 mAb against B16OVA derived melanomas. Moreover, we have observed that in
a synergistic combination of adoptive transfer of activated
tumor specific CD8 T cells plus anti-CD137 mAb treatment,
the synergistic curative effects are not observed if the host
animal is CD137/ indicating that other recipient cells
expression CD137 beyond the transferred T cells are absolutely required (Marinez-Forero and colleagues, manuscript in
preparation). Further research will establish which lymphocyte subsets are recruited to the tumor microenvironment on
CD137 stimulation of tumor endothelium. It might be that not
only effector lymphocytes, but also regulatory T cells could be
invited to enter the tumor. If this is the case, elimination of
Treg cells concomitantly to CD137 therapeutic stimulation
may be advisable as recently observed by the group of Ronald
Levy (51).
Taking collectively, these data point to a model in which the
tumor vascular response to anti-CD137 agonist mAb can be
considered an additional and important element in the multilayered mechanisms of action against tumors elicited by these
promising immunotherapeutic agents (3).
