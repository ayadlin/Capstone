ABSTRACT:
The development of lethal, castration resistant prostate cancer is associated
with adaptive changes to the androgen receptor (AR), including the emergence of
mutant receptors and truncated, constitutively active AR variants. AR relies on the
molecular chaperone HSP90 for its function in both normal and malignant prostate
cells, but the requirement for HSP90 in environments with aberrant AR expression
is largely unknown. Here, we investigated the efficacy of three HSP90 inhibitors,
17-AAG, HSP990 and AUY922, against clinically-relevant AR missense mutants and
truncated variants. HSP90 inhibition effectively suppressed the signaling of wild-type
AR and all AR missense mutants tested. By contrast, two truncated AR variants, ARV7 and ARv567es, exhibited marked resistance to HSP90 inhibitors. Supporting this
observation, nuclear localization of the truncated AR variants was not affected by
HSP90 inhibition and AR variant:HSP90 complexes could not be detected in prostate
cancer cells. Interestingly, HSP90 inhibition resulted in accumulation of AR-V7
and ARv567es in both cell lines and human tumor explants. Despite the apparent
independence of AR variants from HSP90 and their treatment-associated induction,
the growth of cell lines with endogenous or enforced expression of AR-V7 or ARv567es
remained highly sensitive to AUY922. This study demonstrates that functional AR
variant signaling does not confer resistance to HSP90 inhibition, yields insight into
the interaction between AR and HSP90 and provides further impetus for the clinical
application of HSP90 inhibitors in advanced prostate cancer.

INTRODUCTION

CRPC is characterized by sustained androgen receptor
(AR) signaling within the “castrate” environment [1]
through adaptive mechanisms such as increased intratumoral androgen biosynthesis [2], AR overexpression and
amplification [3, 4] and increased response to or levels
of AR co-regulators [5]. Another important mechanism
driving castration-resistance is mutation of the AR gene,
the frequency of which increases with tumor stage and

The mechanisms underlying the development of
castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), characterized
by the survival and proliferation of prostate cancer cells
following androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), have
been the subject of intense scrutiny over the past decade.
The totality of research in this field has demonstrated that

in CRPC [6-8]. Functional analyses have demonstrated
that the majority of these mutations do not cause loss of
function but rather confer one of two main phenotypes:
increased promiscuity of activation by non-classical
ligands, or greater transactivation capacity via altered
interaction with co-regulators. Archetypal examples
include the T877A mutation, which is present in the
LNCaP cell line and allows promiscuous activation by a
variety of hormonal ligands [9], and the E235G mutation
(E231G in mice), which increases basal receptor activity,
affects co-regulator binding and yields a receptor that can
cause oncogenic transformation of the prostate [10].
More recently, the isolation of constitutively active,
truncated forms of the AR has revealed another mechanism
underlying persistent AR signaling in CRPC. These socalled AR variants (ARVs), which arise due to aberrant
splicing and/or structural rearrangements of the AR gene
[11, 12], have variable structures but each lacks all or a
portion of the ligand-binding domain (LBD) [13]. Loss of
the LBD produces transcription factors that can signal in
the absence of ligand and are therefore resistant to LBDtargeting AR antagonists or agents that repress androgen
biosynthesis [12, 14-16]. Two of the most commonly
occurring variants, ARv567es and AR-V7, are induced
by castration and their expression in bone metastases of
men with CRPC is associated with a particularly poor
prognosis [12, 17, 18]. These observations suggest that
ARVs represent an adaptive response to ADT by enabling
sustained growth-promoting signaling in an androgendeplete environment. A mechanism potentially underlying
the association of ARVs with lethal disease was recently
elucidated by Hu and colleagues, who showed that
ARVs direct the expression of a transcriptome that is
characterized by genes involved in mitosis and rapid
progression through DNA-repair check points [19].
The realization that AR signaling is maintained
in CRPC has underpinned the clinical development and
recent FDA approval of agents that more effectively target
androgen biosynthesis (e.g. abiraterone acetate) or the AR
LBD (e.g. MDV3100/enzalutamide). While abiraterone
and enzalutamide have improved the clinical outlook of
men with CRPC, they are not curative [20, 21]. As with
earlier forms of ADT, resistance to these newer generation
agents may involve the emergence of novel forms of
the AR, including point mutants and truncated variants
[19]. As such, there is an urgent requirement for novel
therapeutic strategies for CRPC that effectively inhibit all
forms of aberrant AR signaling.
Heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) is an ATP-dependent
molecular chaperone required for the stabilization and
correct folding of > 200 proteins [22]. These “clients”
include AR and a range of oncoproteins involved in
diverse cellular pathways, making it an attractive target for
prostate cancer [23, 24]. Moreover, HSP90 is frequently
elevated in malignant prostate tissue compared to normal
epithelium, highlighting its clinical relevance [25]. A
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

number of recent studies have demonstrated the preclinical efficacy of HSP90 inhibitors in prostate cancer,
including an ability to delay castration-resistant tumor
growth [26-29]. The most extensively characterized
HSP90 inhibitors are the ansamycin derivatives,
including 17-allylamino-17 demethoxygeldanamycin
(17-AAG) and 17-(dimethylaminotheyl-amino)-17demethoxygeldanamycin (17-DMAG), which have
performed poorly in the clinic due to poor solubility
and pharmacokinetics and hepatotoxicity [30, 31].
Newer-generation agents such as NVP-AUY922
(hereafter referred to as AUY922), a resorcinylic
isoxazole amide, and NVP-HSP990 (HSP990), an orally
available aminopyrimidine, possess more favourable
pharmacological properties and are currently being
assessed in multiple clinical trials (www.clinicaltrials.
gov).
Despite the potential of HSP90 inhibitors for the
treatment of prostate cancer, the consequence of HSP90
inhibition has not been comprehensively assessed in
the context of AR signaling by aberrant forms of the
receptor, such as gain-of-function missense mutants and
constitutively-active variants lacking the LBD. This is
of particular relevance given the emerging realization
that HSP90 and other chaperones act to stabilize mutant
oncoproteins that are characteristic of many human
cancers [23, 24]. In this study, we examined the efficacy
of HSP90 inhibitors against a diverse range of androgen
receptor mutants and variants. Our work further highlights
the clinical potential of these agents in prostate cancer
and provides insight into the chaperone requirements of
aberrant androgen receptors.

RESULTS
HSP90 inhibitors repress the transcriptional
activity of wild-type AR and a wide range of
clinically-relevant AR mutants
HSP90 inhibitors, 17-AAG, AUY922 and HSP990,
were assessed for their ability to decrease wild-type AR
(wtAR) transactivation activity by luciferase reporter
assay in transfected PC-3 prostate cancer cells. All three
HSP90 inhibitors dose-dependently decreased wtAR
transactivation activity but AUY922 was the most
potent agent, reducing wtAR transactivation activity by
>98% at doses of 25nM and above (Fig. 1, top left). The
efficacy of the HSP90 inhibitors were then assessed in
cells transfected with a range of somatic missense gainof-function AR point mutants that have been previously
identified in clinical prostate tumors, mouse models,
xenografts and cell lines (Supplementary Table 1). We
first confirmed that each of the mutants were expressed at
a similar level to wtAR and exhibited comparable DHT692

variants lack the LBD, are active in the absence of
androgen, and are resistant to drugs targeting the LBD
[12, 19]. As expected, in our experimental system the
variants could activate the synthetic probasin promoter in
an androgen-independent manner (Supplementary Fig. 2).
Interestingly, both truncated AR variants exhibited marked
resistance to HSP90 inhibition compared to the full-length
receptor (Fig. 2A). More specifically, doses up to 100 nM
of 17-AAG had no effect on AR-V7 transactivation and no
dose of AUY922 or HSP990 reduced either ARv567es or
AR-V7 by more than ~ 60%.
Inhibition of HSP90 function is known to induce
proteosomal degradation of HSP90 client proteins,
including AR [32]. To determine whether the divergent

responses to HSP90 inhibition were associated with
changes in steady-state protein levels, lysates utilized in
the luciferase assays were analyzed by immunoblotting.
Protein levels of wtAR decreased in a dose-dependent
manner in response to HSP90 inhibition and generally
corresponded well with transcriptional activity (Fig. 2A).
By contrast, steady-state protein levels of the variants
were reduced by HSP90 inhibition but not to the extent of
wtAR. Furthermore, in some cases robust transcriptional
activity could be observed even when variant protein was
effectively reduced by HSP90 inhibition (see, for example,
response of AR-V7 and ARv567es to 100 nM doses of
HSP990).

active AR variants were resistant to HSP90 inhibition,
the transactivation assays were repeated at 10-fold higher
doses of HSP90 inhibitor (0-1000 nM). No transcriptional
activity by wtAR was observed for any AUY922 dose
or any HSP990 treatment ≥ 250nM, an observation that
mirrored receptor protein levels (Fig. 2B). The reduction
in wtAR activity and protein was not due to a decrease
in cell number within the timeframe of the experiment,
as assessed by crystal violet assay (Supplementary Fig.
3). Interestingly, even with high doses of the HSP90
inhibitors, ARv567es and AR-V7 exhibited robust
transcriptional activity: no dose of any HSP90 inhibitor
reduced AR-V7 activity more than ~ 60%, whereas
ARv567es was slightly more sensitive but still maintained
> 20% of its normal activity at the highest doses (Fig.
2B). Moreover, we noted that treatment with doses of
AUY922 greater than 250 nM resulted in a modest but
reproducible recovery of ARV transactivation activity that
was associated with increased protein levels (Fig. 2B).

localization in the absence of DHT and this distribution
was not altered when cells were treated with AUY922
(Figs. 3B and 3C). Thus, nuclear import of ARVs appears
to be independent of the HSP90 chaperone system.
To further examine the relationship between
ARVs and HSP90, we tested whether ARV:HSP90
protein complexes exist in prostate cancer cells by
co-immunoprecipitation assays. FLAG-tagged forms
of wtAR and the ARVs, which exhibited normal
transcriptional activity (Supplementary Fig. 4B), were
used in this experiment. FLAG-AR was isolated by
immunoprecipitation under non-denaturing conditions,
and molybdate was included to preserve chaperone
interactions [33].  As expected, wtAR formed a complex
with HSP90 when grown in androgen-depleted media
that was largely lost following the addition of 1 nM
DHT (Fig. 4A). By contrast, neither of the AR variants
co-immunoprecipitated detectable amounts of HSP90 in
androgen-depleted media (Fig. 4B), further suggesting that
classical AR regulatory mechanisms do not influence ARV
function.

ARV expression is induced by HSP90 inhibition

To further investigate the apparent resistance of
ARv567es and AR-V7 to these agents, we determined
whether HSP90 inhibition affected the subcellular
localization of GFP-tagged forms of the variants. We
first confirmed that GFP-wtAR, GFP-AR-V7 and GFPARv567es were transcriptionally active in PC-3 cells
(Supplementary Fig. 4A). Subsequently, cells expressing
the fusion proteins were treated with DHT and/or AUY922
and fluorescence monitored after 48 h. Wild-type AR
was primarily cytoplasmic when cells were grown in the
absence of androgen (charcoal-stripped serum) and shifted
rapidly to the nucleus with addition of DHT (Fig. 3A).
However, co-treatment with AUY922 blocked the DHTmediated nuclear import of wtAR (Fig. 3A). By contrast,
AR-V7 and ARv567es exhibited primarily nuclear

Our results suggest that transiently-expressed ARVs
function largely independently of the HSP90 chaperone.
To assess whether HSP90 inhibitors affect the expression
and/or stability of endogenously-expressed ARVs, protein
and RNA was isolated from VCaP cells that had been
treated for 24 h with AUY922. VCaP cells were chosen
because they express both AR-V7 and ARv567es and
exhibit selection of AR-V7 in response to agents targeting
the LBD (e.g. MDV3100) [19]. qRT-PCR quantification
revealed that full-length AR (detected with primers that
amplify a region crossing the exon 5-6 splice junction)
and AR-V7 expression increased in response to 40 and
160 nM AUY922 treatment compared to vehicle control
(DMSO) (Fig. 5A). In our hands, ARv567es mRNA was

not detectable by Taqman probe-based qRT-PCR in this
cell line (data not shown), possibly because cells were
grown in media containing full serum and supplemented
with 0.1% DHT, which is known to repress ARv567es
expression [19]. Corresponding protein lysates were
immunoblotted for AR to assess whether the observed
changes in mRNA were coupled to an increase in protein
level (Fig. 5B). Induction of HSP70, a known marker
of HSP90 inhibition [26], confirmed the efficacy of the
drug treatments (Fig. 5B). Importantly, AR-V7 protein
levels were robustly increased following treatment with
AUY922. Interestingly, loss of wtAR protein was not
observed by HSP90 inhibition in VCaP cells, a response
that is incongruent with other prostate cancer cell lines
(e.g. LNCaP, C4-2B, 22Rv1) and tumor explants [26, 27,
34, 35].
To investigate the relationship between HSP90
inhibition and ARV expression in a more biologically
relevant system, we evaluated AR and ARV expression
in human prostate tumors cultured ex vivo in medium
containing AUY922. As previously observed [26],
treatment of tumor tissue with AUY922 markedly reduced
proliferation, as measured by Ki67 immunohistochemistry
(Supplementary Fig. 5). We have previously demonstrated
that AUY922 decreases wtAR protein levels in primary
tumors cultured in this manner [26]. By contrast, wtAR
mRNA levels increased in 9/9 tumors (average = 3.1fold) in response to treatment with 500 nM AUY922
compared to vehicle control (DMSO) (Fig. 5C) (one sided
t test, p = 0.0011). ARV expression was also induced by
AUY922: ARv567es (detectable in 7/9 tumours) and ARV7 (detectable in 8/9 tumors) transcript levels increased
by an average of 8.8-fold (p = 0.0493) and 1.6-fold (p =
0.1170), respectively (Fig. 5C). These data reveal that in
ex vivo cultured primary tumors, AUY922 induces full-

Given that ARVs are resistant to HSP90 inhibitors at
a transcriptional level, can enter the nucleus independently
of the HSP90 chaperone system and can be induced by
AUY922 in primary tumors, we reasoned that persistent
ARV-mediated signaling in prostate cancer cells could
confer some level of resistance to HSP90 inhibition. To
test this idea, we assessed the growth-suppressive activity
of AUY922 in the VCaP line. As reported previously
[26], these cells were sensitive to AUY922 treatment,
with maximal anti-proliferative activity observed at 40
nM (Fig. 6A). VCaP cells did not grow well in androgendeplete media and growth suppression by AUY922 could
not be assessed under these conditions (data not shown).
We subsequently investigated the efficacy of
AUY922 in another prostate cancer cell line with
endogenous ARV expression, 22Rv1 [14]. The ability
of 22Rv1 cells to grow in the absence of androgen or in
the presence of enzalutamide (MDV3100) is conferred
by expression of the AR-V7 variant [14, 36]. Cell
proliferation was reduced in a dose-dependent manner by
AUY922 in both androgen-replete (full fetal bovine serum
(FBS)) and androgen-deplete (charcoal-stripped serum;
DCC-FBS) media (Fig. 6B), where maximal inhibition
was observed at 20 nM and 40 nM, respectively.
To more directly investigate the potential of ARVs to
promote resistance to AUY922, we generated LNCaP cells
stably transfected with inducible forms of wtAR, AR-V7
and ARv567es. Upon treatment with cumate, the proteins
were expressed at levels approximately 1-5% of the

endogenous wtAR (Fig. 6C), a ratio that has been reported
to be physiologically relevant [17]. In growth assays,
robust induction of the proteins was observed after 4 days
(Fig. 6C). As expected, AUY922 effectively suppressed
the growth of LNCaP cells expressing physiological levels
of wtAR (control line + ethanol/cumate; wtAR line +
ethanol), and over-expression of wtAR following cumate
treatment had no discernable impact on drug efficacy (Fig.
6D). Similarly, enforced over-expression of AR-V7 or
ARv567es did not confer any detectable level of resistance
to HSP90 inhibition by AUY922 (Fig. 6D).

Using AR-specific reporter assays, we found that
HSP90 inhibition effectively disrupted the transcriptional
activity of a wide range of clinically-relevant AR somatic
missense point mutants. Therefore, as for wtAR, canonical
HSP90 regulatory pathways are likely to control the
maturation, stabilization, ligand binding and nuclear
import of mutant receptors. This finding strengthens the
case for the application of HSP90 inhibitors in castrationresistant tumors, which are more likely to express gainof-function mutant receptors. As expected from IC50
values, solubility and affinities for HSP90, AUY922 and
HSP990 were more efficacious against the AR mutants
than the ansamycin derivative, 17-AAG. This corresponds
with previous work from our laboratory demonstrating
enhanced efficacy of AUY922 and HSP990 in the
LNCaP cell line that expresses the T877A mutation [26].
The increased capacity of these new generation agents
to disrupt both wild-type and mutant AR signaling, in
addition to their improved pharmacologic and toxicologic
profiles, further supports their clinical investigation in men
with advanced prostate cancer.
In contrast to the missense AR mutants, the
C-terminally truncated AR-V7 and ARv567es
both displayed resistance to HSP90 inhibitors at a

DISCUSSION
Current treatments for CRPC prolong survival,
but are not curative. The critical role of HSP90 in the
stabilization, maturation and activation of AR and other
proteins that contribute to the progression of prostate
cancer highlights the potential of HSP90 inhibitors as
therapeutic agents. However, until now, no study has
comprehensively assessed whether clinically relevant
gain-of-function AR mutants and truncated androgen
receptors that can emerge in CRPC are reliant on the
HSP90 chaperone system for activity.

transcriptional level. Indeed, even doses up to 1000
nM of AUY922 and HSP990 only partially disrupted
ARV signaling. Similarly, a recent study found that
the transcriptional activity of AR-V7 was shown to be
resistant to other new and old-generation HSP90 inhibitors
(ganetespib and geldanamycin, respectively) [37]. Two
findings from our study likely underpin the apparent
independence of ARV activity from HSP90. First, the
nuclear localization of AR-V7 and ARv567es was largely
unaffected by the potent HSP90 inhibitor, AUY922. This
observation mirrors recent research demonstrating that
the nuclear import of ARVs was not disrupted by 17-AAG
[38]. By contrast, even in a cell line model of CRPC that
exhibits ligand-independent activity of full-length AR,
normal HSP90 function is necessary for nuclear import
of the receptor [39], highlighting the distinction between
ARVs and wtAR. Second, co-immunoprecipitation assays
revealed that interactions between ARVs and HSP90
are not detectable even in cells transiently expressing
high levels of the ARV. Interaction surface mapping
has demonstrated that chaperone interactions localize
primarily to the LBD of steroid receptors [22]. More
specifically, analysis of the rat AR found that amino
acids 703 and 758 of the rat AR, corresponding to the
hinge region and part of the LBD in the human AR, are
important for its interaction with HSP90 [40]. Studies
of the glucocorticoid receptor identified a specific
7-amino acid sequence required for HSP90 binding that
corresponds with amino acids 670 to 676 in the hinge
domain of the human AR [41], which is a reported proteinprotein interaction surface [42]. ARv567es contains
the hinge domain but none of the LBD whereas AR-V7
lacks both the hinge and LBD, supporting a role for these
C-terminal domains in mediating an interaction between
full length AR and HSP90.
Collectively, the observation that HSP90 inhibitors
have a minimal effect on ARV transcriptional activity
and nuclear localization and our inability to detect
HSP90:ARV protein complexes indicate that AR-V7 and
ARv567es function largely independently of HSP90.
Whether other proteins “chaperone” ARVs is currently
unknown. Classic members of the HSP90 molecular
machinery, such as HSP70, p23, FKBP52 and Cyp40,
either bind to the AR LBD or indirectly with AR via
HSP90 [22, 43]. As such, we do not expect these factors
to be important regulators of C-terminally truncated
AR variants. A plausible candidate ARV chaperone is
HSP27, which was found to bind directly to the AR NTD
in vitro and has been linked to treatment resistance and
cell survival in prostate cancer [44]. At least two lines
of evidence support the concept that a non-canonical
chaperone system, perhaps comprising HSP27 and/or
other factors, regulates ARV function. First, by comparing
the expression of full-length AR with ARVs at both
the protein and mRNA level, Hornberg and colleagues
found evidence for increased stability of ARVs in CRPC
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

bone metastases [17]. Protection from intracellular
protein surveillance mechanisms, such as the ubiquitinproteasome system, is a major function of HSPs and
stress proteins. Second, the intrinsically disordered nature
of the NTD means that chaperone-mediated protection
from misfolding, aggregation and illicit protein:protein
interactions would likely benefit ARVs. Identifying ARV
regulators, including chaperones, is an important next
step in elucidating the function of these novel drivers of
prostate cancer progression and is likely to have significant
clinical implications.
While our discussion has focused on the resistance
of ARVs to HSP90 inhibition, the observation that high
doses of all three agents at least partially suppressed ARVdriven transcription is worth consideration. We envision at
least three possible explanations for this finding. First, we
cannot rule out the possibility that ARVs retain a residual
level of interaction with, and reliance on, HSP90. Indeed,
a subset of the variants retain the hinge region, a proposed
HSP90 interaction surface. Second, as discussed above,
ARVs may utilize alternative chaperones that could be
affected by high concentrations of HSP90 inhibitors.
Finally, ARV activity is likely to be indirectly affected
by HSP90 inhibition through deregulation of alternative
client proteins. For example, it was recently found that
suppression of the PI3K-AKT pathway inhibits AR-V7
transcriptional activity [45], and HSP90 is an important
regulator of AKT [46].
Despite the apparent autonomy of ARVs from
the HSP90 chaperone system, we observed that the
growth/proliferation of cell lines expressing AR-V7 or
ARv567es, either endogenously or in an enforced manner
from an inducible promoter, is highly sensitive to HSP90
inhibition. Thus, the growth advantage associated with
ARV expression is unable to compensate for disruption
of other critical cellular pathways by HSP90 inhibitors.
It follows that sensitivity to these agents is largely
independent from both classical and aberrant AR signaling
axes, a concept further supported by the observation that
HSP90 inhibitors are highly effective in both AR-positive
and AR-negative settings in vitro [26]. Collectively, these
findings highlight the broad mode of action of these
agents, a characteristic also likely to minimize the therapymediated selection pressures that drive drug resistance.
This study also provided insight into the relationship
between HSP90 inhibition and AR gene expression.
Importantly, we demonstrated that treatment with the
potent HSP90 inhibitor AUY922 caused an increased
level of transcripts encoding full-length AR (VCaP cells
and primary tumors), AR-V7 (VCaP cells only; trend
to increase in primary tumors) and ARv567es (primary
tumors only; not detectable in VCaP cells). One potential
explanation for this finding is that liganded AR can
negatively regulate its own expression [47]: thus, the
loss of AR protein associated with HSP90 inhibition,
which occurs in AUY922-treated, ex vivo cultured
699

Plasmids

prostate tumors [26], could de-repress the AR gene.
This hypothesis may also explain why AR inhibition
(MDV3100 treatment or knockdown with siRNA) leads to
accumulation of AR-V7 and emergence of an alternative
transcriptome [19]. Alternatively, HSP90 inhibition may
impact on mRNA splicing, stability and/or translation,
leading to accumulation of AR mRNA [48]. Irrespective
of mechanism, the finding that HSP90 inhibitors can cause
accumulation of AR and ARVs may be relevant to the
clinical application of these agents. For example, although
we have demonstrated that the broad mode of action of
HSP90 inhibitors can overcome the selection for ARVs in
short-term in vitro experiments, the consequences of such
selection during prolonged treatment of men is unknown.
Our findings provide a rationale for clinical application
of a combinatorial treatment strategy comprising HSP90
inhibitors and agents that target the AR-NTD.
AR-V7 and ARv567es were detectable by qRTPCR in 8/9 and 7/9 primary tumors, respectively. For ARV7, this proportion is similar to what has been reported
in previous studies [16, 17]. By contrast, ARv567es has
rarely been detected in primary tumors to date [12, 17].
A possible explanation for this discrepancy relates to
methodology: we employed a highly specific probe-based
assay rather than the SYBR assay employed in earlier
studies. Our data suggests that ARv567es may be more
prevalent than previously estimated, an important finding
given its association with survival [17].
In summary, our study provides key new insights
into the clinical potential of HSP90 inhibitors in cells that
are characterized by aberrant AR signaling. Despite the
independence of constitutively-active AR variants from
the HSP90 chaperone system, HSP90 inhibitors are likely
to be effective in CRPC by targeting signaling by wildtype AR, missense AR mutants and other critical pathways
required for growth and survival of prostate cancer cells.

The pGL4.14-probasin-ARR3-tk-luciferase reporter
has been reported [32]. Plasmid constructs harbouring
full-length AR with somatic missense mutations were
created from pCMV-AR by PCR-based megaprimer in
vitro mutagenesis as previously described [33]. pcDNAAR-V7 and pcDNA-ARv567es expression plasmids have
been described [19]. pcDNA-HA-GFP-ARv567es was
made by inserting a PCR product containing the complete
GFP coding sequence into the BamHI site of pcDNAHA-ARv567es [12]. pEGFP-AR-V7 and pEGFP-AR
were generously provided by M. Marcelli [34]. pCMV3xFLAG-AR, pCMV-3xFLAG-V7 and pCMV-3xFLAGv567es were made by ligating AR and ARV PCR products
into the EcoRI/XbaI sites of p3xFLAG-CMV-9 (Sigma).
3xFLAG-AR fragments were also inserted into the pCDHEF1-CymR-T2A-Puro vector (System Biosciences).

Cell lines
VCaP, PC-3 and 22Rv1 human prostate carcinoma
cells were obtained from the American Type Culture
Collection. All cell lines underwent verification by shorttandem repeat profiling in 2010 by CellBank Australia.
PC-3 cells were maintained in RPMI-1640 containing 5%
FBS or phenol-red free RPMI containing 5% charcoalstripped serum (DCC-FBS). 22Rv1 cells were maintained
in RPMI-1640 containing 10% FBS or phenol-red free
RPMI containing 10% charcoal-stripped serum (DCCFBS). VCaP cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s Modified
Eagle’s Medium containing 10% FBS, 1% sodium
pyruvate, 1% MEM non–essential amino acids, and 0.1
nM 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT; Sigma). LNCaP lines
expressing cumate-inducible 3xFLAG-wtAR, 3xFLAGARv567es and 3xFLAG-AR-V7 lentivirus were made
using the SparQ cumate switch lentivector system
(Systems Biosciences). pCDH-EF1-CymR-T2A-Puro
vectors were packaged into lentiviral particles using
pPACK packaging systems (System Biosciences). To
make stable cell lines, LNCaP cells were infected with 1 x
107 virus particles per 1 x 106 cells then selected with 1 ug/
ml puromycin (Invitrogen) for 10 days. Stably transduced
LNCaP lines were maintained in RPMI-1640 containing
10% FBS.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Luciferase transactivation assays
AR transactivation assays were performed
essentially as described [32]. Briefly, AR-negative PC-3
prostate cancer cells were seeded in 96-well plates (1.5
x 104 cells/well) and then transfected with 100 ng of
pGL4.14-probasin-ARR3-tk-luciferase reporter plasmid and
1.5 ng of the appropriate AR expression construct using
700

Cell growth assays

Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Plasmid quantities were
chosen to ensure receptor activity was within the linear
range. After 4 h, treatment media containing HSP90
inhibitor (0-1000 nM) and 1 nM DHT (Sigma) was added
to the cells. Cells were lysed 24 h later with Passive Lysis
Buffer (Promega) and frozen overnight at -80ºC. Lysates
were assayed for luciferase activity using the Luciferase
Assay System (Promega) and a plate reading luminometer
(TopCount; Packard). Subsequently, protein from six
replicate wells was pooled, centrifuged at 10,000g for 10
min at 4ºC, and equal volumes of the supernatants were
analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting.

Trypan blue exclusion counts were performed on
22Rv1 and VCaP cells treated with AUY922. Growth
assays were stopped when DMSO-treated cells reached
the stationary phase of growth. For LNCaP lines with
inducible AR and ARV expression, cells were seeded out
at 2 x 104 cells/well in 24-well plates. The next day, day
zero counts were taken and cells were treated with 0.3 ug/
ml cumate to induce AR and ARV expression. One day
later, cells were treated as appropriate with AUY922 or
DMSO (control). Cells were counted after a further 72
hours using trypan blue exclusion assays.

Visualization of GFP-tagged proteins

Ex vivo culture of human prostate tumors

PC-3 cells were seeded at a density of 3.0 x 104
cells/well in 8-well Lab-Tek chamber slides (Nunc) and
left overnight to adhere. The cells were then transfected
with plasmids expressing GFP-tagged AR, AR-V7 and
ARv567es using Lipofectamine 2000. After 24 h the
cells were treated with AUY922 or DMSO (vehicle
control) for 1 h in the absence or presence of 1nM DHT
or ethanol (vehicle control). The cells were then fixed
using 4% paraformaldehyde, washed with PBS and
incubated overnight at 4ºC with an antibody specific for
tubulin. Alexa-Fluor 594 donkey anti-mouse IgG (Life
Technologies) was used to visualize tubulin staining.
ProLong Gold Antifade Reagent with DAPI (Life
Technologies) was used as mounting media and to detect
cell nuclei. Cells were viewed using an Olympus IX71
fluorescent microscope and images were obtained with
an Olympus DP70 cooled digital color camera at 20x
magnification.

Fresh prostate cancer specimens were obtained with
written informed consent through the Australian Prostate
Cancer BioResource from men undergoing robotic radical
prostatectomy at the Royal Adelaide Hospital. Tissues
were dissected and cultured as described previously [26]
in medium containing DMSO or 500 nM AUY922. After
48 h of culture, tissues were snap frozen and stored at
-80oC.

RNA extraction and quantitative real-time RTPCR
For cell line experiments, VCaP cells were
seeded at a density of 4 x 105 cells/well in 12 well
plates and treated for 24 h with AUY922 (40 or 160
nM) or DMSO. RNA was extracted using Trizol using
standard techniques. For prostate tumors, samples were
homogenized using a Precellys tissue homogenizer
(Bertin Technologies) or mortar and pestle and RNA
was extracted using Trizol. 200 ng of RNA was reverse
transcribed and analyzed by SYBR green qRT-PCR as
described previously [36]. Primers for full-length AR
(forward: CCTGGCTTCCGCAACTTACAC; reverse:
GGACTTGTGCATGCGGTACTCA) amplify a region
spanning exons 5 and 6, which is not found in C-terminally
truncated AR variants. Primers for AR-V7 have been
described previously [16]. Taqman qRT-PCR was used to
quantify ARv567es using the following primers and probe
(forward: CCTTGCTCTCTAGCCTCAATGAA; reverse:
CTTGATTAGCAGGTCAAAAGTGAACT;
probe:
6FAM-CCTTGCCTGATTGCGAGA-MGB-NFQ).

Co-immunoprecipitation
AR:HSP90 complexes were isolated by
immunoprecipitation as described previously [35].
Briefly, androgen-starved PC-3 cells were transfected
with constructs expressing FLAG-tagged wild-type AR or
ARVs using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) for 4 h. The
cells were treated 24 h later with vehicle (0.1% ethanol)
or 1 nM DHT (Sigma) for 1 h in 5% DCC-FBS phenol-red
free RPMI, then lysed in 500 μl IP buffer (20 mM Tris HCl
(pH 7.5), 50 mM NaCl, 20 mM Na2MoO4, 0.5% NP-40
Alternative, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA (pH 8.0), 2 mM
DTT and protease inhibitors). The lysates were sonicated
twice at low power for 15 sec each (Bioruptor; Diagenode)
and cleared by centrifugation (10 min, 16,000g at 4ºC).
Samples were immunoprecipitated for 2 h with rotation
at 4°C using anti-FLAG M2 agarose beads (Sigma) and
then washed three times with IP buffer. Protein was eluted
by boiling in SDS-PAGE loading buffer for 5 min and
analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting.
