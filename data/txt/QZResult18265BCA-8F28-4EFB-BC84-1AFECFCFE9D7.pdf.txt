BACKGROUND: The optimal weekly oral dose of sirolimus and intravenous nanoparticle albumin–bound paclitaxel (nab-paclitaxel)
were evaluated. METHODS: A phase 1b study was performed to evaluate escalating doses of oral sirolimus (5-60 mg) on days 2, 9,
and 16 with intravenous nab-paclitaxel (100 mg/m2) on days 1, 8, and 15 in a 28-day cycle. A run-in treatment of nab-paclitaxel (day
214) and sirolimus (day 27) was administered for pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic assessments. Clinical trial endpoints
included dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), maximum tolerated doses, and response rates. Pharmacodynamics included immunohistochemistry for phosphatase and tensin homolog, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), AKT, phosphorylated AKT, S6K1, and phosphorylated S6K1; exploratory gene expression analysis; and [18F]fludeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography. RESULTS:
Twenty-three patients with advanced solid tumors were treated. Fifteen patients had prior taxane therapy. Twenty-two patients were
evaluable for responses. One patient had a complete response, and 5 patients had a partial response (3 confirmed). DLTs were seen
in 1 patient each at 10 (grade 3 dyspnea/hypoxia) and 40 mg (grade 4 leukopenia/neutropenia) and in 2 patients at 60 mg (grade 3
fatigue and grade 4 pericardial effusion). Patients with higher expression of posttreatment AKT and a greater decline in FDG activity
were more likely to have a treatment response or stable disease. CONCLUSIONS: Sirolimus showed an acceptable safety profile at a
weekly dose of 40 mg with weekly intravenous nab-paclitaxel at 100 mg/m2 on days 1, 8, and 15 every 28 days. The posttreatment
AKT score and changes in FDG activity may have roles as early predictors of responses to mTOR inhibitors. Cancer 2015;121:1817-26.

INTRODUCTION
Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a serine threonine kinase member of the cellular phosphatidylinositol 3kinase (PI3K) pathway, which is involved in multiple biologic functions, such as transcriptional and translational control.
It is a downstream mediator in the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway and plays a critical role in cell survival.1 mTOR inhibitors have been shown to be promising agents in reducing tumor growth in several solid cancers, both in vitro and in
vivo.2,3 Sirolimus is an oral mTOR inhibitor currently Food and Drug Administration–approved as an immunosuppressive agent for organ transplantation and for use after placement of cardiac arterial stents.4,5 Sirolimus is administered daily
in doses ranging from 2 to 40 mg/day. A weekly schedule of sirolimus has been evaluated in a phase 1 clinical trial by
Cohen et al.6 The single-agent maximum tolerated dose was 90 mg weekly, with a toxicity profile and pharmacokinetics
similar to those of other mTOR inhibitors.
Paclitaxel is a chemotherapeutic agent that promotes microtubule assembly and stabilization with significant activity
in solid tumors.7,8 Nanoparticle albumin–bound paclitaxel (nab-paclitaxel; Abraxane) uses the nab platform, which

eliminates the need for toxic solvents through the binding
of hydrophobic drug forms to albumin. Nab-paclitaxel is
Food and Drug Administration–approved for the treatment of advanced breast cancer, in combination with
carboplatin for locally advanced or metastatic non–small
cell lung cancer, and in combination with gemcitabine for
metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma.9-11 In advanced
breast cancer patients, nab-paclitaxel at 260 mg/m2 was
superior in the response rate and time to disease progression in comparison with paclitaxel at 175 mg/m2 administered every 3 weeks.12 In patients with prior taxane
therapy, nab-paclitaxel at 100 mg/m2 administered
weekly had antitumor activity similar to that of the higher
dose but with a better safety profile.13
In vitro, synergistic interactions were reported with
the combination of sirolimus and paclitaxel; sirolimus
dramatically enhanced paclitaxel-induced apoptosis.14
This effect was sequence-dependent, with better results
seen when sirolimus was given 12 to 24 hours after paclitaxel. In vivo, there was a significant reduction in the
sirolimus-sensitive tumor volume with the combination
versus either agent alone. Activation of the PI3K/AKT/
mTOR pathway has been also reported to be a mechanism
of resistance to antimicrotubule chemotherapeutic agents
such as paclitaxel. Inhibition of this pathway with sirolimus may overcome Akt-mediated resistance and restore
apoptosis.15,16
We proposed a phase 1 study to evaluate the safety
and maximum tolerated dose of weekly dosing of sirolimus
in combination with nab-paclitaxel in patients with
advanced solid tumors. We evaluated PI3K/AKT pathway
activation by immunohistochemistry for phosphatase and
tensin homolog (PTEN), mTOR, AKT, phosphorylated
AKT (pAKT), S6K1, and phosphorylated S6K1 (pS6K1)
with the Automated Quantitative Analysis (AQUA) immunofluorescence platform in pre- and posttreatment tissue biopsy samples. In addition, we used pre- and posttreatment
biopsy samples from patients in the trial to interrogate a predefined gene expression signature of AKT activation.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Design, Treatment, and Dose Escalation

This was an open-label, dose-escalation phase 1b study
evaluating the safety of weekly oral doses of sirolimus in
combination with weekly nab-paclitaxel. Patients were to
be enrolled in a cohort of 3 patients after a 3 1 3 phase 1
scheme with expansion of the cohort to 6 patients in the
event that a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) occurred. The
maximum tolerated dose was the highest dose level at
1818

which no more than 1 patient in a cohort of 6 developed a
DLT and was just below the dose level at which 2 of 6
patients experienced a DLT.
Nab-paclitaxel at 100 mg/m2 was administered on
days 1, 8, and 15 every 28 days. Sirolimus was administered
on days 2, 9, and 16 at one of the following escalating dose
levels: 5, 10, 20, 40, and 60 mg. A run-in treatment of both
study agents was administered before cycle 1 for pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic assessments; nab-paclitaxel
at 100 mg/m2 was administered on day 214, and sirolimus
(doses of 5-60 mg) was administered on day 27. Treatment was discontinued for toxicity or disease progression.
The primary endpoint was the DLT rate at the end of cycle
1. Secondary endpoints included the overall response rate
according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
(RECIST) version 1.0.
Eligibility Criteria

Eligible patients were 18 years or older with histologically
confirmed advanced solid cancer refractory to conventional
therapy. Patients had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology
Group performance status of 0 to 2 with adequate bone
marrow, liver, and renal function (defined as follows: hemoglobin level  9 g/dL, absolute neutrophil count  1.5
3 109/lL, leukocyte count  3000/lL, platelet
count  100 3 109/lL, bilirubin level  upper limit of
normal [ULN], aspartate aminotransferase and alanine
aminotransferase levels  2.5 3 ULN, and creatinine level  1.5 3 ULN [or creatinine clearance  50 mL/min/
1.73 m2 for patients with creatinine levels > 1.5 3 ULN]).
Patients with active brain metastasis, a peripheral
neuropathy  grade 2, active infections, uncontrolled
intercurrent illness, a human immunodeficiency virus
infection, or uncontrolled hyperlipidemia (defined as a
fasting serum cholesterol level > 350 mg/dL and a triglyceride level > 400 mg/dL) were excluded. Patients were
excluded if cytotoxic, biologic, or radiation therapy had
been administered within 4 weeks of the initiation of the
study or if they had undergone prior surgery or endocrine
therapy within 2 weeks. Patients with prior exposure to
nab-paclitaxel, sirolimus, sirolimus analogs, or experimental agents targeting mTOR were also excluded.
Patients requiring concomitant use of medications that
inhibit the liver microsomal enzymes CYP3A4 and
CYP2CA8/9, including warfarin, were excluded. All
patients provided informed consent. The study was
approved by the ethics committees of the participating
institution. The study was conducted in accordance with
Good Clinical Practice guidelines and the Declaration of
Helsinki.

Pharmacokinetics

For nab-paclitaxel pharmacokinetics, blood samples (57 mL) were collected with the first dose of nab-paclitaxel
on day 214 and with the next dose on day 1 of cycle 1 at
the following time points: before infusion; 15 minutes after the start of infusion; immediately before the end of
infusion; and 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 6, 24, 48, and 72 hours after
the end of infusion. The plasma nab-paclitaxel concentration was measured with high-performance liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry. Human plasma samples
were extracted with acetonitrile and methanol (2:1), and
this was followed by centrifugation. The supernatants
were evaporated dry and then dissolved in a mobile solution (0.05% vol/vol; 45:55 formic acid/acetonitrile). The
chromatographic separation was achieved on a Zorbax
SB-C18 column (Agilent, Palo Alto, Calif), and the mobile phase was directly introduced into the mass spectrometer. Quantification was performed via multiple reaction
monitoring of the transitions of m/z 876.4!m/z 308.1
for paclitaxel with a dwell time of 150 milliseconds.
For sirolimus pharmacokinetics, we performed a
limited sampling strategy as described by Kaplan et al.17
Blood samples were collected with the first dose of sirolimus on day 27 and with the next sirolimus dose on day 2
of cycle 1 at the following time points: before oral sirolimus administration and 2 and 6 hours after dosing.
Whole blood concentrations of sirolimus were measured
after the samples, controls, and standards were pretreated
with zinc sulfate and acetonitrile containing the internal
standard (ascomycin and D12 cyclosporine), and this was
followed by centrifugation. The supernatant was transferred to the high-performance liquid chromatography
autosampler and was injected into a C18 cartridge column. The drugs were eluted off the column with a step
gradient of 50% methanol to 100% methanol (both containing 2 mM ammonium acetate and 0.1% formic acid).
Quantification was performed via monitoring of the fragmentation of selected ammoniated precursor ions to specific product ions with positive electrospray ionization.

considered evaluable for safety if they received at least 1
dose of the study treatment. Toxicity was evaluated
according to the National Cancer Institute’s Common
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (version 3.0). A
first-cycle DLT was defined as any nonhematologic toxicity  grade 3 (excluding alopecia, untreated nausea, and
vomiting), grade 4 neutropenia for >5 days or febrile neutropenia requiring hospitalization, grade 4 thrombocytopenia, more than 1 missed dose of the drug during cycle 1
due to toxicity, or a treatment delay > 2 weeks due to
unresolved toxicity. The maximum tolerated dose was
defined as the dose level at which no more than 1 of 6
patients developed a DLT. Tumor measurements were
assessed by conventional imaging at the baseline and at
the end of cycle 2 and every 2 cycles thereafter and were
measured with RECIST 1.0.
[18F]Fludeoxyglucose positron emission
tomography (FDG-PET)

FDG-PET studies were obtained at the baseline when
indicated and were repeated at the end of cycles 1 and 2.
For each patient, 2 to 5 baseline lesions were selected, and
the sum of the standardized uptake values (SUVs) from
each lesion was calculated. This was compared to the sum
of SUVs of the selected lesions at the end of each cycle.
Changes in the sum SUV were then correlated with the
clinical response to treatment.
Tumor biopsies

Patients were asked to donate tumor biopsy samples
before the first dose of therapy and 1 week after the
first dose of sirolimus when this was feasible. Tissue
core/punch biopsy samples were processed as follows: 2
cores in formalin for fixation and embedding in paraffin (formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded) and 2 cores
frozen and embedded in optimal cutting temperature
(OCT) compound. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded
tissue was sectioned and evaluated for the invasive disease component.

Assessments

Tissue microarrays/AQUA

Screening included a clinical history, physical examination, performance status, complete blood count, chemistry panel, electrocardiogram, serum pregnancy test (when
indicated), lipid panel, and tumor measurements. Cycle 1
safety assessments included a weekly toxicity evaluation,
chemistry, and complete blood count. The lipid panel was
repeated at the end of cycle 1. Weekly physical examinations and laboratory studies were performed during the
first cycle and every 4 weeks thereafter. Patients were

Biomarkers of the AKT pathway were assessed with
AQUA, a modified indirect immunofluorescence
method.18 The primary antibodies used to define the tumor compartment of each histospot included mouse
monoclonal cytokeratin AE1/AE3 (M3515; Dako Corporation, Carpinteria, CA) or wide-spectrum screening rabbit anti-cow cytokeratin antibodies (Z0622; Dako), each
at 1:100. Other target antibodies were incubated overnight at 4 C and included PTEN, mTOR, Akt, pAkt,

S6K1, and pS6K1 (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers,
MA). Secondary labeling of targets was performed by signal amplification with horseradish peroxidase–labeled secondary reagents (species-specific Dako Envision), and this
was followed by cyanine 5 tyramide incubation. 4’,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole in an antifading mounting medium was used to stain the nuclear compartment (Prolong
Gold, Invitrogen, Eugene, Ore). With relevant compartment analysis, the quantitative immunofluorescence of
each marker was detected per image across the invasive
region of the tumor specimens. AQUA scores for each
image across the biopsy were averaged to create a mean
AQUA score per marker to represent each individual sample. Spearman rho correlations were performed with StatView 5.0.1 (SAS Institute, Inc, Cary, NC) to compare the
mean AQUA scores of each marker for both pre- and
posttreatment samples. These correlations are shown in
Figure 1, where Spearman rho values of 0.4 or higher are
bolded to indicate a strong correlation. In the postsample
table, the correlations with an asterisk indicate where a
drop or loss in correlation occurred after treatment.

Gene expression profiling

RNA extraction and gene expression profiling were completed for tissue cores with >20% malignant epithelium.
OCT blocks were sectioned for a hematoxylin-eosin evaluation of the invasive component, the core was dissected
out of the OCT and cut into portions that were a few
millimeters in length, and they were weighed. If the
weight was greater than 30 mg, the sample was divided for
a sample weight less than 30 mg. Total RNA was used to
prepare amplified complementary DNA from total RNA
extracted from tissues frozen in OCT, processed with the
AllPrep DNA/RNA kit (Qiagen, Valencia, Calif), and
hybridized to Illumina Ref8. The analysis was performed
with the limma package.19 An AKT score was derived
from the expression levels of 28 genes shown to be altered
by AKT expression and by subsequent mTOR inhibition
as described by Majumder et al.20 This score was calculated as the Pearson correlation coefficient between
expression levels in each tumor sample and the relative
expression levels in the data provided by Majumder et al

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics

From May 2006 to May 2009, 23 patients with advanced
solid tumors received weekly nab-paclitaxel in combination with weekly sirolimus given in 5 escalating dose
cohorts of 5 to 60 mg daily. Patient baseline characteristics are described in Table 1. The median patient age was
61 years (range, 41-78 years). All patients had treatmentrefractory disease. Six patients (26%) had prior treatment
with 4 lines of therapy. Fifteen patients (65%) had prior
treatment with a taxane.
Study Treatment

A median of 3 cycles (range, 1-8 cycles) of treatment
were administered. Eight patients (35%) received only 1
cycle of treatment before discontinuation secondary to
progression or toxicity. Ten patients (43%) were treated
with 4 cycles. Twelve patients experienced a treatment
delay, and 5 patients discontinued treatment because of
toxicity. One patient with non–small cell lung cancer
discontinued treatment after achieving a complete
response with 4 cycles of therapy. One patient discontinued treatment after 7 cycles per the patient’s request.
Cancer

The remaining patients discontinued treatment because
of disease progression.

Four patients experienced cycle 1 DLT events (Table 2),
which included grade 3 dyspnea/hypoxia (1 patient in the
10-mg cohort), grade 4 leukopenia (1 patient in the 40mg cohort), grade 3 fatigue (1 patient in the 60-mg
cohort), and grade 4 pericardial effusion and grade 3 deep
vein thrombosis (1 patient in the 60-mg cohort). The
maximum tolerated dose of sirolimus was determined to
be 40 mg in combination with nab-paclitaxel at 100 mg/
m2 in a 28-day cycle. No treatment-related deaths
occurred. Two patients experienced grade 3 hyperglycemia and hypertriglyceridemia in the first cycle; however,
this was medically controlled and was not considered a
DLT. One serious adverse event occurred in which a
patient was hospitalized with concern for neutropenic
fever; however, at the time of admission, neutropenia was
excluded.
All-grade adverse events that occurred in more than
10% of patients are reported in Table 2. The most common all-grade hematologic events were neutropenia (14
patients or 61%) and anemia (13 patients or 57%). Fatigue (10 patients or 43%), anorexia (14 patients or
61%), alopecia (10 patients or 43%), and nausea/vomiting (10 patients or 43%) were also frequently reported.

Of the 23 enrolled patients, 22 patients were evaluable for
a response. One patient in the 10-mg cohort withdrew
from the study after the first dose because of a DLT and
was not evaluable. The remaining 22 patients had measurable disease according to RECIST 1.0. A complete
response was seen in 1 patient with non–small cell lung
cancer after 4 cycles of therapy. Five patients had a partial
response: 1 patient in the 10-mg cohort, 2 patients in the
1822

40-mg cohort, and 2 patients in the 60-mg cohort. Of
these 5 patients with a partial response, 3 had a confirmed
partial response (2 breast cancer patients and 1 endometrial cancer patient), and 2 patients had an unconfirmed
partial response. Nine patients had stable disease. Five of
the 6 patients with a complete response or partial response
had previously been treated with a taxane. The overall
response rate was 27% (6 of 22 patients).

doses of oral sirolimus on both day 27 and day 2 of cycle
1 (Figure 2A,B). The blood nab-paclitaxel concentrations
for each sirolimus dosing cohort on day 214 (before sirolimus dosing) and day 1 of cycle 1 (7 days after first oral
sirolimus dose) are shown in Figure 2C,D. The nab-paclitaxel pharmacokinetic parameters before and after sirolimus dosing are shown in Table 3. Consistent with
previous observations, the nab-paclitaxel pharmacokinetic
profile in this study exhibited a rapid distribution and a
large volume of distribution. No evidence of paclitaxel
drug accumulation was observed on day 1 of cycle 1. In
comparison with day 214 with no sirolimus, patients in
cohorts receiving higher doses of sirolimus (40 and
60 mg) appeared to have lower areas under the curve and
increased clearance of nab-paclitaxel (Table 3). However,
the study was limited by the small group size and large
intersubject and intercohort variability, which confounded the data comparison across doses. Overall, the
effect of sirolimus on nab-paclitaxel pharmacokinetics was
minimal.

Pharmacodynamics
Proteomic analysis of the AKT pathway

Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor samples were
collected from 11 of the 23 enrolled patients. Eight of the
11 patients underwent biopsy both before and after therapy, and 2 patients underwent biopsy only before therapy.
One additional patient underwent biopsy both before and
after therapy but was found to have insufficient tumor
cells in the pretherapy biopsy sample.
The 8 pre- and posttherapy matched pairs were evaluated with AQUA to measure the protein expression of
the AKT pathway and were analyzed with Spearman rho
correlations, with a 2-sided P value  .1 considered statistically significant because of the exploratory nature of this
analysis. This was a small sample size for such an analysis
to be positive, but the exploratory analyses may provide
hypotheses for further studies.
The AKT pathway activity was assessed by a correlation of protein and phosphoprotein levels at the baseline
and after 1 dose of therapy with the mean AQUA scores.

Figure 3. Changes in (A) [18F]fludeoxyglucose uptake and (B) AKT scores with respect to responses. PD indicates progressive
disease; SD/PR, stable disease/partial response; SUV, standardized uptake value.

At the baseline, there was a correlation between expressions of Akt pathway phosphoproteins; however, this was
not seen in posttreatment samples, and that suggests that
there was disruption of the pathway (Figure 1).
Gene expression profiling

A 28-gene expression signature of AKT pathway activity
was assessed with Illumina Ref8 gene expression arrays on
pre- and posttreatment samples. Figure 3B shows that
patients with higher expression of the AKT score in posttreatment samples were more likely to have a response or
stable disease (4 of 4 cases with a score > 0.12 had stable
disease/partial response, whereas only 1 of 4 cases with a
score  0.12 had stable disease/partial response; P 5 .099
[t test]). This suggests that upregulation of AKT was
occurring in response to the mTOR inhibition, as seen in
other studies.21
FDG-PET

The PI3K signaling pathway is involved in multiple biologic functions and has a role in the central regulation of
cellular glucose use. The activation of Akt may be a factor
in the increased glucose use of cancer cells.22,23 A number
of clinical studies have indicated that quantification of
changes in FDG uptake may provide an early and sensitive pharmacodynamic marker of the tumoricidal effect of
chemotherapy.24-27 Fifteen of 23 patients had a baseline
1824

PET/computed tomography scan, which was repeated at
the end of cycle 1 treatment. Figure 3A shows a significantly greater change in the posttreatment SUV from the
baseline in patients who had a partial response or stable
disease by RECIST versus patients who had disease progression (244.42778% vs 210.8%, P 5 .04 [t test]).
DISCUSSION
Combining PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway inhibitors with
cytotoxic drugs may improve antitumor efficacy and
potentially limit repopulation of cancer cells between
doses of cytotoxic drugs. Mondesire et al14 reported synergy between paclitaxel and sirolimus with enhanced
paclitaxel-induced apoptosis. This effect was sequencedependent, with better results seen when sirolimus was
given 12 to 24 hours after paclitaxel. A single oral dose of
5 mg/m2 produced a mean peak serum concentration of
100 ng/mL with a half-life of approximately 60 hours,
and this suggests that less frequent dosing may be efficacious.28 Therefore, we designed this phase 1b study to
evaluate the safety and activity of sirolimus administered
24 hours after the administration of weekly nab-paclitaxel
for treatment-refractory solid tumors. In our study,
weekly dosing of sirolimus in combination with nabpaclitaxel resulted in an overall response rate of 27% (6 of
22 patients) and a disease control rate of 68% (15 of 22
Cancer

patients), with responses in patients with prior treatment
with taxane therapy. The 40-mg maximum tolerated dose
in combination with weekly nab-paclitaxel at 100 mg/m2
has an acceptable safety profile, with neutropenia, anorexia, and fatigue as the most common adverse events.
The pharmacokinetics of sirolimus overall demonstrated a
linear relationship between dose and plasma concentration, as expected from previous studies, with no significant drug-drug interaction between sirolimus and nabpaclitaxel noted.
Sirolimus binds with FK binding protein 12 and
forms a sirolimus–FK binding protein 12 complex that
binds to and inhibits mTOR complex 1. This results in
the dephosphorylation of downstream effector molecules,
including the ribosomal protein S6K1 and the translational repressor protein eukaryotic initiation factor 4E
(4E binding protein 1), and ultimately leads to cell cycle
arrest in the G1 phase.2 AKT activation may occur
through a negative feedback mechanism by mTOR complex 2. Inhibition of S6K1 is considered a surrogate maker
of the pharmacodynamic effects of mTOR inhibitor.29
The use of AQUA to quantify protein expression within
the AKT pathway demonstrated effective disruption of
the AKT pathway with the treatment regimen.
Gene expression signatures were also assessed in this
study in 8 tumor pairs. Using an AKT signature from
Majumder et al,20 we developed an AKT activation score
to assess the pathway at a genomic level. It is of interest
that a higher AKT score in the posttreatment sample was
associated with response, and this suggests that reciprocal
upregulation of AKT may be occurring in tumors treated
with mTOR inhibitors as seen in model systems.21 What
is of particular interest is that this finding is correlated
with response because it has been suggested as a mechanism of resistance to therapy. This study suggests, on the
basis of 2 orthogonal methods, that upregulation of AKT
is associated with response and may be a measure of vulnerability to mTOR inhibition. Whether upregulation of
AKT is a harbinger of subsequent resistance to therapy
remains to be determined.
It is known that mTOR inhibitors affect tumor
growth by targeting cellular metabolic pathways, and
there is evidence to support the use of FDG-PET to quantify tumor glucose metabolism. Recently, the use of FDGPET as a predictive biomarker of response was evaluated
in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma treated
with everolimus, and it was found that changes in SUV at
2 weeks versus the baseline only modestly correlated with
changes in tumor size at 8 weeks.30 In our study, a statistically significant decrease in mean FDG activity was found
Cancer

June 1, 2015

on PET scans after 1 cycle of therapy in responders versus
nonresponders. This suggests that FDG activity may have
a role as an early predictor of response to mTOR inhibitors. This finding will need validation in a larger patient
population.
In conclusion, the maximum tolerated dose and the
recommended dose for phase 2, which will evaluate the
combination of weekly sirolimus and nab-paclitaxel, is
40 mg of sirolimus administered 24 hours after nab-paclitaxel at 100 mg/m2. This combination warrants further
evaluation in paclitaxel-sensitive malignancies, such as
breast and endometrial cancers, in which a preclinical synergistic effect with PI3K/mTOR pathway inhibitors has
been demonstrated.14,31,32 The roles of the posttreatment
AKT signature and changes in FDG activity on PET scans
need to be further evaluated in future studies in this group
of patients as predictors of responses to this drug regimen.
