Abstract

Author Manuscript

The intrinsic mitochondrial apoptotic pathway acts through two core pro-apoptotic proteins Bax
and Bak. While Bax and Bak seem to play redundant roles in apoptosis, accumulating evidence
also suggests that they might not be interchangeable under certain conditions, at least in some
human cell lines. Here we report the generation of Bak knockout as well as BaxBak double
knockout HCT116 human colon carcinoma cells. We show that Bak is dispensable for apoptosis
induced by a variety of stimuli including ABT-737 but not for 5-FU-induced apoptosis. In
addition, Bax deficiency only provides partial protection against camptothecin and cisplatininduced apoptosis and no protection against killing by Puma or ABT-737 plus Noxa
overexpression. Moreover, Bak is activated normally in response to many chemotherapeutic drugs
in the presence of Bax but remains kept in check by Mcl-1 in the absence of Bax. Our data suggest
that Bax and Bak are functionally redundant but they are counteracted by distinct anti-apopotic
Bcl-2 family proteins in different species.

Introduction

Author Manuscript

The essential roles of Bax and Bak in apoptosis were demonstrated by the complete
resistance of BaxBak double knockout (DKO) mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells to a
variety of apoptotic stimuli (Wei et al 2001) and the finding that pro-apoptotic BH3-only
proteins such as Bim and Puma act through Bax/Bak (Zong et al 2001). Bax and Bak appear
functionally redundant since loss of Bax or Bak alone does not provide significant protection
against apoptosis (Lindsten et al 2000, Wei et al 2001). However, growing evidence

suggests that Bax and Bak play non-redundant roles in apoptosis induced by a certain
specific stimuli, at least in human cells. For example, Bak or Bax single knockdown renders
HeLa cells resistant to Ngo or cisplatin-induced apoptosis (Kepp et al 2007). Bax deficient
or Bak knockdown human glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) tumor cells are also refractory
to UV, staurosporine (STS) and doxorubicin (Cartron et al 2003). The BH3-only protein
natural born killer (NBK)/Bcl-2-interacting killer (Bik) has been shown to act entirely
through Bax in human cells (Gillissen et al 2003) but solely dependent on Bak in mouse
cells (Shimazu et al 2007).

Author Manuscript

Unlike Bax deficient MEF cells, Bax−/− HCT116 cells are extremely resistant to
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (Zhang et al 2000) and TRAIL (Deng et al
2002, von Haefen et al 2004). Since Bak is expressed at similar levels in Bax−/− as in the
wild type HCT116 cells and is functional (Theodorakis et al 2002), it suggests that Bax is
predominantly required for a large variety of apoptotic stimuli in certain cell lineages.
Another possibility is that Bak is completely suppressed by some inhibitors, such as Bcl-xL
and Mcl-1 (Willis et al 2005). Although Bak activation is absent in Bax−/− HCT116 cells
upon cisplatin exposure (Kepp et al 2007) or NBK overexpression (Gillissen et al 2007), it
has never been tested whether or not Bak activation occurs in wild type HCT116 cells in
response to those particular stimuli. Hence, it is not clear whether Bax is required for Bak
activation (directly or indirectly) or certain apoptotic stimuli only specifically activate Bax
but not Bak. The roles of Bax and Bak can only be explicitly dissected by establishing
Bak−/− and Bax−/−Bak−/− DKO HCT116 cell lines.

Author Manuscript

Here we report the generation of Bak single and BaxBak double knockout HCT116 cell
lines. We show that Bax−/−Bak−/− DKO cells are more resistant to various apoptotic agents
than Bax−/− cells, indicating that Bak is still involved in many apoptotic responses. In cases
where Bax−/− cells are as resistant as Bax−/−Bak−/− DKO cells, for instance, to ABT-737
treatment, Bak is activated in the wild type cells but becomes restrained by Mcl-1 in Bax−/−
cells, highlighting the important role of Bax in removing Mcl-1’s grip on Bak. Our data also
suggest that Bax is not restrained by Mcl-1 in human cells and the differential expression
levels of Mcl-1 in MEFs and HCT116 cells might underlie the distinct phenotypes of Bax
deficiency in these two species.

Generation of Bak−/− and Bax−/−Bak−/− DKO cells

Author Manuscript

Bax seems to be the key pro-apoptotic factor in human cells since Bax−/− HCT116 cells are
extremely resistant to apoptosis (Zhang et al 2000) and Bak appears to be dispensable for
apoptosis based on gene knockdown studies (Cartron et al 2003, Chandra et al 2005,
Gillissen et al 2007, Gillissen et al 2010). In order to explicitly dissect the role of Bak in
apoptosis, we sought to knock out Bak by homologous recombination in HCT116 cells. We
targeted exon 5 of the Bak gene. Exon 5 encodes the BH1 domain and part of the BH2
domain whereas the BH3 domain is located on exon 4 and the transmembrane domain (TM)
resides on exon 6 (Figure 1A). Targeting exon 5 would result in a C-terminal truncated
protein lacking the TM domain (due to the premature stop codon introduced by the targeting
vector, Figure 1D) or an N-terminal truncated protein lacking the BH3 domain. Since the

transmembrane domain is essential for mitochondrial localization of Bak and the BH3
domain is central to its apoptotic activity, either of these truncated proteins would be
inactive. A promoter-less gene-targeting vector (pSEPT) was employed (Topaloglu et al
2005). In combination with the effective rAAV transduction system (Kohli et al 2004), the
pSEPT vector exhibits high recombination efficiency. 12 out of 36 clones were Bak+/- and 5
out of 24 clones of Bax−/− cells were Bak+/-, about 30% and 20% targeting efficiency,
respectively. A similar targeting frequency was achieved in the second round targeting.
Western blotting confirmed the successful abolishment of Bak expression in clones #29, 36,
44 and 49 yielding Bak−/− and clones # 2 and 19 yielding Bax−/−Bak−/− DKO (Figure 1B).
The premature stop codon introduced by the targeting vector (Figure 1D) likely triggers
mRNA decay and aberrant splicing does not occur as no truncated Bak is produced in
Bak−/− and Bax−/−Bak−/− DKO cells (Figure 1C), indicating that our Bak−/− cells are truly
null.

Bak is dispensable for apoptosis induced by a variety of stimuli when Bax is present

Author Manuscript

We first sought to test whether Bak deficiency also leads to protection against NSAIDs. As
shown in Figure 2A, Bax−/−Bak−/− DKO cells are no more resistant to either indomethacin
or sulindac acid treatment than Bax−/− cells. Bak−/− cells display no resistance and are even
more sensitive to both NSAID agents than the wild type cells. This is confirmed by analysis
of indomethacin-induced PARP cleavage (Figure 2B), an indicator of caspase activity.
Consistently, upon indomethacin treatment, over 60% of wild type and Bak−/− cells
exhibited Cyt.c release whereas less than 4% of Bax−/− and 2% of Bax−/− Bak−/− DKO cells
displayed Cyt.c release (Figure 2C). Similarly, ABT-737, an inhibitor of anti-apoptotic
Bcl-2 family proteins, induced a similar level of Cyt.c release in wild type and Bak−/− cells
at 48h treatment (Figure 2C). In contrast, Bax−/− cells exhibited as strong resistance as
Bax−/−Bak−/− KO cells to ABT-737. This is further confirmed by caspase-3/7 activity assay
shown in Figure 2D. ABT-737-induced apoptosis in HCT116 cells is dosage dependent
(Figure 2E). Bax−/− and Bax−/−Bak−/− DKO cells remain resistant to treatment of increasing
ABT-737 concentrations whereas Bak−/− cells exhibit similar sensitivity as the wild type
cells (Figure 2E).

Author Manuscript

Finally, we conducted clonogenic assays. Again, while no colony survival was detected in
the wild type and Bak−/− cells upon sulindac acid or ABT-737 treatment, similar numbers of
colonies were observed in Bax−/− and Bax−/−Bak−/− DKO cells (Figure 2F). Altogether,
these data strongly suggest that Bax, not Bak, plays a major role in apoptosis in HCT116
cells and Bak seems to be dispensable. However, Bax−/− cells are significantly less resistant
to camptothecin treatment (either 24 h or 48 h) than Bax−/−Bak−/− DKO cells (Figure 2C),
indicating that Bak does play a role in apoptosis against certain stimuli. In support of this, no
colony survival can be detected in either Bax−/− or Bak−/− cells after 4 days of staurosporine
treatment whereas a substantial number of colonies survived with Bax−/−Bak−/− DKO cells
(Figure 2F). Therefore, Bak can be activated to mediate apoptosis under certain
circumstances or extended treatment but remains inactive when Bax is not present under
most conditions.

Bak is involved in 5-FU induced apoptosis even when Bax is present

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Bax−/− HCT116 cells display moderate resistance to 5-FU as reported previously (Zhang et
al 2000), suggesting that Bak might be involved in 5-FU induced apoptosis. Indeed, Bak−/−
cells are as resistant to 5-FU as Bax−/− cells as shown by reduced Cyt.c release (Figure 3A)
up to 72 h treatment and display lower caspase-3/7 activity than wild type cells at 24h
(Figure 3B). Loss of both Bax and Bak led to complete protection against 5-FU (Figure 3A),
indicating that both Bax and Bak mediate 5-FU-induced apoptosis. In contrast to a previous
report that rules out a role of Bak in synergistic induction of apoptosis by TRAIL and 5-FU
(von Haefen et al 2004), Bak−/−cells exhibited a significant reduction in caspase-3/7 activity
after TRAIL and 5-FU for 48h, to a similar extent as Bax−/− cells (Figure 3B).
Corroborating this, re-introduction of Bak expression in Bak−/− cells sensitizes them to the
5-FU insult (Figure 3C). Bak is also shown to be required for cisplatin-induced apoptosis
(Kepp et al 2007) using Bak siRNA. In contrast, we found that loss of Bax but not Bak
provides strong protection whereas the loss of both Bax and Bak leads to complete
resistance to cisplatin (Figure 3A). This indicates that Bak is dispensable for cisplatininduced cell death when Bax is present but becomes essential for apoptosis when Bax is
absent.
Bak is responsive to Puma activation in the absence of Bax

Author Manuscript

Is Bax/Bak differentially activated by various apoptotic stimuli as suggested by previous
reports (Cartron et al 2003, Deng et al 2002, Gillissen et al 2003, Kepp et al 2007,
Lindenboim et al 2005, Neise et al 2008) or is Bak activation dependent on Bax? To shed
some insight into this question, we first tested if Bax and Bak respond to pro-apoptotic BH3
proteins in different manners. Overexpression of Noxa did not kill wild type cells but cotreatment with ABT-737 allowed Noxa to kill both Bak−/− and Bax−/− cells as previously
reported (Figure 4B). BAD, binding to all anti-Bcl-2 members except Mcl-1 (Chen et al
2005), can kill wild type cells and Bak−/−cells but not Bax−/− cells (Figure 4A).

Author Manuscript

The three Bax/Bak direct activators (Kim et al 2006), Bim, Bid and Puma exhibited
differential killing ability in Bax−/− and Bax−/−Bak−/− DKO cells. Both Bax−/− and
Bax−/−Bak−/− DKO cells are resistant to Bid killing whereas Bim kills Bax−/− cells and
Bax−/−Bak−/− DKO cells effectively to similar extent (Figure 4A), suggesting that Bim
could exert its killing ability independent of Bax/Bak. Nonetheless, a point mutation in
Bim’s BH3 domain (BimS L62A), which disrupts its binding to Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL (Lee et al
2008), abolishes Bim’s killing ability (Figure 4A). In contrast, Puma kills Bak−/− and Bax−/−
cells as effectively as the wild type cells and exhibited no killing in Bax−/−Bak−/− DKO cells
(Figure 4A-B), indicating that Bak can be activated by Puma in the absence of Bax. While
all pro-and anti-apoptotic genes used in this study are expressed at a comparable level
(Figure 4D-E), transient expression can lead to more than a 10-fold greater expression level
than the stable expression level as shown for example with Bak expression (Figure 5B).
Since Bak is mainly sequestered by Bcl-xL and Mcl-1 whereas Bax could be bound by
Bcl-2, Bcl-w, Bcl-xL and Mcl-1 (Willis et al 2005, Willis et al 2007), it is not surprising that
NBK, which specifically binds Bcl-xL and Mcl-1, is completely dependent on Bak for
killing activity in murine iBMK cells (Shimazu et al 2007). However, NBK is reported to be

solely dependent on Bax in HCT116 cells (Gillissen et al 2007). To address this
discrepancy, we tested NBK’s killing in our Bak−/− and Bax−/− Bak−/− DKO cells. As
shown in Figure 4B-C, NBK killed Bak−/− HCT116 cells as effectively as wild type cells but
exhibited limited killing of Bax−/− cells. Co-treatment with ABT-737 exposes Bax−/− cells
to NBK-mediated killing (Figure 4B). NBK displays low affinity to Mcl-1 (Chen et al
2005), but can Co-IP with Mcl-1 in vivo (Chen et al 2005, Shimazu et al 2007). However,
NBK/Mcl-1 interaction is not detected in HCT116 cells (Gillissen et al 2007). The fact that
both ABT-737 and Noxa sensitize Bax−/− cells to NBK (Figure 4B-C) suggests that NBK
might be able to sequester Mcl-1 in human cells, but not as efficiently as in murine cells.
Bcl-xS has also been shown to be exclusively dependent on Bak in MEFs as it kills both
wild type and Bax−/− MEFs very effectively (Lindenboim et al 2005). However, untagged
Bcl-xS does not even kill wild type HCT116 cells (Figure 4C) although it does sensitize
Bax−/− HCT116 cells to ABT-737 treatment, acting like Noxa (Figure 4C).

Author Manuscript

Bak activation is dependent on Bax indirectly

Author Manuscript

It has been reported that Mcl-1 has low binding affinity to Bax and overexpression of Mcl-1
does not block overexpression of Bax-induced cell death (Zhai et al 2008). This is consistent
with the observation here that Bak−/− HCT116 cells are sensitive but Bax−/− cells are
refractory to ABT-737 killing since ABT-737 is a specific inhibitor for Bcl-2, Bcl-w and
Bcl-xL but not Mcl-1. It is further supported by the fact that Noxa can sensitize Bax−/−
HCT116 cells to ABT-737 (Figure 4B). Corroborating this, when a Bak mutant (Bak m2,
I85A/N86A) that fails to be bound by Bcl-xL and Mcl-1 (Kim et al 2006) is stably expressed
in Bax−/−Bak−/− DKO cells (that should behave like Bax−/− cells), they are even more
sensitive to camptothecin treatment than are wild type cells (Figure 5A). In contrast,
Bax−/−Bak−/− DKO cells expressing wild type Bak remain resistant to camptothecin
treatment (Figure 5A). The wild type and mutant Bak are expressed at similar levels in those
stable cell lines (Figure 5B). It is noteworthy that when highly expressed (such as transient
overexpression), Bak can kill wild type and Bax−/−Bak−/− DKO HCT116 cells (Figure 5C).
The killing ability of Bak overexpressioin is again blocked by overexpression of Bcl-xL or
Mcl-1 (Figure 5C). Like overexpression of Bak, overexpression of Bax also kills all four
types of cell lines (wild type, Bak−/−, Bax−/− and Bax−/−Bak−/− DKO) (Figure 5C). In
contrast to a previous report (Zhai et al 2008), overexpression of either Bcl-xL or Mcl-1
blocks the killing ability of Bax overexpression (Figure 5C). This is consistent with previous
observations that overexpression of Bcl-xL or Mcl-1 can still protect Bak m2 mutant from
apoptosis (Kim et al 2006).

Author Manuscript

Given that Bax−/− HCT116 cells are resistant to a variety of apoptotic agents, it is not
unexpected that Bak activation is not observed in Bax−/− cells. But is Bax required for Bak
activation? To test this, we performed immunoprecipitation with antibodies that can detect
activated Bak (ab-1). Whereas activated Bak is readily detected in wild type cells with either
camptothecin or ABT-737 treatment, there is no Bak activation in the Bax−/− cells under
these conditions (Figure 5D). This is further confirmed by confocal imaging of Bak−/− cells
and Bax−/−Bak−/− DKO cells. We used cells stably expressing GFP-Bak (Figure 5E) since
anti-Bak (ab-1) antibody does not work well in HCT116 cells for immunofluoresecence
staining. ABT-737, camptothecin and the combination of TRAIL plus 5-FU all induce Bak

activation indicated by the foci formation in GFP-Bak expressing Bak−/− cells, but much
less in GFP-Bak expressing Bax−/−Bak−/− DKO cells (Figure 5E, supplementary Figure 1).
Corroborating this, immunoprecipitation with anti-Bak ab-1 antibody in GFP-Bak stably
expressing cells also clearly showed that Bak activation occurs normally in response to
ABT-737 or camptothecin treatment but is largely reduced when Bax is absent (Figure 5F).
These data suggest that Bak can be activated during many death stimuli-induced apoptosis
when Bak seems to be dispensable, which is likely indirectly dependent on Bax. It has also
been shown that Bak can be activated by Actinomycin D and staurosporine in MCF-7 cells
(Neise et al 2008). Three common Bak antagonists: Bcl-xL, Mcl-1 and VDAC2 are
expressed at similar levels in the wild type, Bax−/−, Bak−/− and Bax−/−Bak−/− DKO cells
(Figure 5G).
Mcl-1 determines the resistance of Bax KO cells

Author Manuscript

The fact that Noxa sensitizes Bax−/− cells to ABT-737 suggests that Bak is inhibited by
Mcl-1 in the absence of Bax. If this is indeed the case, then silencing Mcl-1 in Bax−/− cells
should sensitize them to apoptosis. As shown in Figure 6A, Mcl-1 and Bcl-xL were
effectively knocked down by corresponding siRNAs. Whereas control siRNA has no effect
on Bax−/− cells as they remain resistant to apoptosis, Mcl-1 siRNA sensitizes Bax−/− cells to
staurosporine (Figure 6B) or ABT-737 (Figure 6C) indicated by caspase-3/7 activity (Figure
6B-C) or Cyt. c release (Figure 6D-E). In contrast, Bax−/−Bak−/− DKO Mcl-1 siRNA cells
remain completely resistant to all treatment (Figure 6B-E). Unlike Mcl-1 siRNA, Bxl-xL
siRNA has no effect on the resistance of Bax−/− cells to ABT-737 (Figure 6D) or
camptothecin (Figure 6E), suggesting that Mcl-1 but not Bcl-xL keeps Bak in check in
Bax−/− cells.

Discrepancy of Bax/Bak mediated apoptosis in HCT116 and MEF cells

Author Manuscript

The discrepancies on Bax versus Bak-dependent apoptotic responses reported in published
studies could be due to different experimental settings, apoptotic treatments and cell lines
(see Table 1). In order to gain insight into this discrepancy, we sought to compare Bax/Bakmediated apoptosis in HCT16 and MEF cells directly under the same experimental settings.
First, as previously reported (Wei et al 2001), Bak−/− MEF and Bax−/− MEF cells are
similarly sensitive to staurosporine as wild type MEF cells whereas Bax−/− Bak−/− DKO
MEFs remains resistant (Figure 7A), suggesting that Bax and Bak are redundant in
mediating staurosporine-induced apoptosis in MEF cells. In contrast, Bax−/− HCT116 cells
are nearly as resistant to staurosporine as Bax−/−Bak−/− DKO cells (Figure 7B). Second, as
previously reported (van Delft et al 2006), even wild type MEFs seem to be resistant to
ABT-737 as 20 μM ABT-737 induces very limited apoptosis indicated by both caspase-3/7
activity (Figure 7C) and Cyt.c release (Figure 7D). Bak−/− MEF and Bax−/− MEF seem to be
as sensitive to ABT-737 as to WT MEF cells (Figure 7C-D). Third, unlike untagged Bcl-xS
(Figure 4D), GFP-tagged Bcl-xS does induce cell death in HCT116 cells (Figure 7E),
although it is much less potent than in MEF cells (Figure 7F). Even in MEF cells, GFP-BclxS triggers moderate cell death comparing to Bim, NBK or Puma (Figure 7F). Nonetheless,
in both species Bcl-xS seems to preferentially trigger Bak-mediated cell death, consistent
with a previous report (Lindenboim et al 2005). Fourth, in both species, Puma-induced
apoptosis is completely dependent on Bax and Bak (Figure 7E-F). Moreover, whereas NBKOncogene. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2012 December 28.

Wang and Youle

induced apoptosis seems to be dependent on Bax (Figure 4C-D) in human cells, Bax and
Bak are equally involved in NBK-induced cell death in murine cells (Figure 7F). In addition,
Bim is able to induce Bax/Bak-independent apoptosis in both HCT116 and MEF cells
(Figure 7E-F). However, it does require much higher expression level of Bim to kill BaxBak
DKO cells than the wild type cells (data not shown).

Discussion

Author Manuscript

Although some members of the intrinsic cell death pathway are conserved between
nematodes and mammals, the two essential core pro-apoptotic proteins, Bax and Bak, are
missing from the C.elegans genome. Bcl-2 like proteins in Drosophila are more closely
related to Bok. Nonetheless, Bax and Bak orthologs have been recently found in many
ancient species, such as Hydra (Dunn et al 2006) and sea anenome (Zmasek et al 2007). Bax
and Bak appear to have been lost several times during evolution since the zebrafish genome
contains only Bax orthologs but not Bak (Kratz et al 2006), and sea urchin retains Bak but
not Bax orthologs (Dunn et al 2006). However, zBax2, although more closely related to
human Bax than hBak, behaves functionally like hBak since it cannot be antagonized by the
Bcl-2 ortholog in zebrafish (Kratz et al 2006). It is not clear whether the evolution of Bax
and Bak in mammals reflects the regulatory complexity of these species or acts as a
surveillance mechanism so that proper cell death proceeds in case the other has been shut
off.

Author Manuscript

Bax and Bak have been long believed to be redundant to one another since Bax−/− and
Bak−/− MEFs or BMK cells are both sensitive to various apoptotic stimuli such as
staurosporine, etoposide, UV-C and serum withdraw (Degenhardt et al 2002, Lindsten et al
2000, Wei et al 2001). However, they can be counteracted by distinct anti-apoptotic Bcl-2
family proteins. Bak is specifically bound by Bcl-xL and Mcl-1 whereas Bax can be
inhibited by Bcl-2, Bcl-w, Bcl-xL and Mcl-1 (Willis et al 2005, Willis et al 2007).
Therefore, Bak seems to be less restrained than Bax. Consistently, loss of Bak in general
provides better protection than the loss of Bax against apoptosis when certain stimuli only
remove the inhibitory effects of a subset of Bcl-2 family proteins (Table 1). For instance,
Bak−/− MEF cells are reported to be more resistant to UV-C treatment than Bax−/− MEFs
(Willis et al 2005). Bax−/− MEFs are more sensitive than Bak−/− MEFs to the killing of a
Noxa m3 mutant, which can inhibit Bcl-xL, Bcl-w and Mcl-1(Willis et al 2007).
Corroborating this, both Bak−/− MEFs and Bax−/− MEFs are refractory to ABT-737
(Konopleva et al 2006), which can only inhibit Bcl-2, Bcl-w and Bcl-xL but not Mcl-1. If
the inhibitory effect of Mcl-1 is removed by stably expressing human Noxa, Bak−/− MEFs
are still more resistant to ABT-737 than Bax−/− MEFs (van Delft et al 2006). As an extreme
example, Bak−/− iBMK (immortalized baby mouse kidney) cells are as resistant as
Bax−/−Bak−/− iBMK cells to NBK, which only binds Bcl-xL and Mcl-1(Shimazu et al
2007).
However, this does not appear to be the case in human colon cancer cells. First, it has been
shown that Bax−/− HCT116 cells are resistant to many apoptotic insults such as
indomethacin, sulindac acid, 5-FU, TRAIL and ABT-737 (Deng et al 2002, Gillissen et al
2010, Zhang et al 2000). We also found that Bax−/− HCT116 cells are as resistant to

ABT-737 as Bax−/−Bak−/− DKO HCT116 cells whereas Bak−/− HCT116 cells are as
sensitive as wild type cells. Given that ABT-737 sequesters Bcl-2, Bcl-w and Bcl-xL but not
Mcl-1 and that Bak−/− HCT116 cells are as sensitive as wild type HCT116 cells to
ABT-737, our data strongly suggest that Bax is not restrained by Mcl-1 in human cells.
Consistently, no Bax-Mcl-1 interaction was detected in OCI-AML3 cells (Konopleva et al
2006) or HEK293 cells (Zhai et al 2008). In addition, when endogenous Mcl-1 is inhibited
by stably expressing Noxa or siRNA silencing, Bax−/− HCT116 cells become as sensitive to
ABT-737, camptothecin, or TRAIL as wild type cells (Figure 4B and Figure 6) (Gillissen et
al 2010), indicating that Bak, on the other hand, is still kept in check by Mcl-1 in the
absence of Bax in HCT116 cells. Although VDAC2 was reported to be the main antagonist
to keep Bak in check (Kim et al 2006), our data show that it is Mcl-1 that keeps Bak in
check in Bax−/− HCT116 cells. However, in wild type cells, once Bax is activated and
oligomerizes, the Mcl-1 inhibitory effect on Bak is removed indirectly. Second, NBK
exclusively kills Bax−/− iBMK not Bak−/− iBMK cells (Shimazu et al 2007), but kills both
Bax−/− MEF and Bak−/− MEF as effectively as wild type MEF cells (Figure 7F). In contrast,
NBK kills Bak−/− HCT116 but not Bax−/− HCT116 cells (Figure 4B-C) (Gillissen et al
2007). It has also been shown that NBK/Bik does not bind Mcl-1 in HCT116 cells (Gillissen
et al 2007). However, we found that like Noxa, NBK also sensitizes Bax−/− HCT116 cells to
ABT-737 and partially kill Bax−/− HCT116 cells when highly expressed (Figure 4B-C),
indicating that NBK might be able to sequester Mcl-1 directly or indirectly. In addition, the
relatively high expression level of endogenous Mcl-1 in human cells also contributes to the
resistance to apoptosis of Bax KO HCT116 cells.

Author Manuscript

In summary, our data strongly suggest that Bax and Bak are functional redundant although
they appeared to play non-redundant roles due to the extreme resistance of Bax KO HCT116
cells to apoptosis (Cartron et al 2003, Gillissen et al 2003, Gillissen et al 2007, Kepp et al
2007, LeBlanc et al 2002). Once the inhibitory effect of Mcl-1 on Bak is removed by Noxa
overexpression (Figure 4B) (Konopleva et al 2006), Mcl-1 knockdown (Figure 6) (Gillissen
et al 2010) or increased Bak expression (Figure 5C) (LeBlanc et al 2002), Bax−/− HCT116
cells become as sensitive as wild type cells. In addition, significant differences on the
interaction specificity between anti-and pro-apoptotic proteins might exist between human
and mice (such as the effect of NBK). Since HCT116 cells are less refractory to lipid-based
transfection than MEF cells, the Bak−/− and Bax−/−Bak−/− DKO HCT116 cells provide a
complete set complementary to the widely used Bax-/- HCT116 cells and shall be a valuable
tool for more relevant studies on chemotherapeutic drugs and cancer.

Generation of Bak KO and BaxBak DKO HCT116 cells. (A) Schematic diagram of gene
targeting of Bak locus. The top panel shows BH3, BH1, BH2 and the transmembrane (TM)
domains of Bak protein in orange, green, pink and blue. The exons encoding the
corresponding domains are labeled in the same color in the Bak genomic locus and are
shown as rectangles. Shaded regions of rectangles represent coding exons. Triangles indicate
LoxP sites. (B) Confirmation of Bak knockout by Western blot. #29, 36, 44 and 49 are
homozygous Bak KO and #2 and #19 are homozgyous BaxBak DKO clones. Asterisk
indicates a non-specific band detected by anti-Bax antibody. (C). No truncated or aberrant
Bak was produced in Bak KO and BaxBak DKO HCT116 cells. Bak KO and BaxBak DKO
MEFs were used as a control. anti-Bak NT recognizes the N-terminal region of Bak. (D)
Final Bak ORF sequence after gene targeting. Sequence underlined is introduced by the
targeting vector. LoxP site is shown in red. The two premature stop codons are shown as
bold italic. Alternating coding exons are shown in black or blue color. Note that exon 1 is a
non-coding exon.

Bak deficiency provides no protection against many apoptotic stimuli. (A) Cell viability
assay in wild type, Bak KO, Bax KO and BaxBak DKO cells with 500 μM indomethacin
and 120 μM sulindac acid treatment for 48h. Cell viability was measured with Promega’s
CellTiter-Glo luminescent cell viability assay and normalized to non-treatment controls. The
experiment was repeated three times and representative data were shown as average±SD.
Since non-treated cells proliferate at a greater rate than the treated cells, this assay
underestimates the survival rate of treated cells. (B) PARP cleavage in indicated cell lines
