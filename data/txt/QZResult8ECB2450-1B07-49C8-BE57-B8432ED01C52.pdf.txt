Abstract

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) is a modified base present at low levels in diverse cell types in
mammals1–5. 5hmC is generated by the TET family of Fe(II) and 2-oxoglutarate-dependent
enzymes through oxidation of 5-methylcytosine (5mC)1,2,4–7. 5hmC and TET proteins have been
implicated in stem cell biology and cancer1,4,5,8,9, but information on the genome-wide
distribution of 5hmC is limited. Here we describe two novel and specific approaches to profile the
genomic localization of 5hmC. The first approach, termed GLIB (glucosylation, periodate
oxidation, biotinylation) uses a combination of enzymatic and chemical steps to isolate DNA

fragments containing as few as a single 5hmC. The second approach involves conversion of 5hmC
to cytosine 5-methylenesulphonate (CMS) by treatment of genomic DNA with sodium bisulphite,
followed by immunoprecipitation of CMS-containing DNA with a specific antiserum to CMS5.
High-throughput sequencing of 5hmC-containing DNA from mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells
showed strong enrichment within exons and near transcriptional start sites. 5hmC was especially
enriched at the start sites of genes whose promoters bear dual histone 3 lysine 27 trimethylation
(H3K27me3) and histone 3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) marks. Our results indicate that
5hmC has a probable role in transcriptional regulation, and suggest a model in which 5hmC
contributes to the ‘poised’ chromatin signature found at developmentally-regulated genes in ES
cells.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We developed two independent methods for precipitation of 5hmC in genomic DNA. The
GLIB method (Fig. 1a) entails addition of a glucose molecule to each 5hmC with T4 phage
β-glucosyltransferase (BGT)3 (Supplementary Fig. 1a). The glucose moiety is oxidized with
sodium periodate, which converts the vicinal hydroxyl groups to aldehydes10, and further
modified with aldehyde-reactive probe, which adds two biotin molecules to each 5hmC (Fig.
1a). A related strategy, which uses a custom-synthesized UDP-glucose analogue (UDP-6N3-glucose), was recently used to profile 5hmC distribution in mouse brain11. The second
method uses an antibody against cytosine 5-methylenesulphonate (CMS)5, produced by
reaction of 5hmC with sodium bisulphite (Fig. 1b)12. Anti-CMS antibodies are more
sensitive and less density-dependent than anti-5hmC in DNA dot blot assays5. Both methods
are specific for DNA containing 5hmC (Supplementary Fig. 1b)5.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We examined the ability of GLIB-treated (biotinylated) and bisulphite-treated 5hmCcontaining DNA to be pulled down by streptavidin and anti-CMS antisera, respectively.
Using varying ratios of dCTP:dhmCTP, we generated 201 base pairs PCR amplicons with
differing incorporation of cytosine and 5hmC in identical sequence contexts (Supplementary
Table 1). At each dhmCTP:dCTP ratio, the fraction of amplicons that contain no 5hmC, and
therefore should not be precipitated, can be calculated using the binomial equation
(Supplementary Table 2). Observed and calculated pull-down efficiencies were very similar
(Fig. 1c): even at low densities of 5hmC, more than 90% of DNA fragments calculated to
contain a single 5hmC were precipitated after GLIB treatment. Anti-CMS pull-down
showed increased density dependence compared to GLIB, but had very low background,
such that there was still a strong preference for precipitation of sparsely hydroxymethylated
amplicons over unmodified ones (Fig. 1d). The performance of a commercial polyclonal
anti-hmC antiserum was inferior to that of anti-CMS, in terms of higher background pulldown of unmodified DNA (3.0% versus 0.06%) as well as greater density dependence (Fig.
1e). By testing PCR amplicons with varying 5mC, we confirmed that the methyl-DNA
immunoprecipitation (MeDIP) technique, which uses a monoclonal antibody to 5mC, is
extremely density-dependent (Fig. 1f).
We applied the GLIB and anti-CMS techniques to enrich 5hmC-containing regions in
genomic DNA using genomic DNA with low, intermediate and high levels of 5hmC
(Supplementary Fig. 1c, left panel). For the GLIB and anti-CMS pull-downs, the amount of
specifically precipitated genomic DNA was proportional to the relative amount of 5hmC
(Supplementary Fig. 1c). The GLIB technique did not produce mutations (Supplementary
Table 3), the biotinylated DNA could be efficiently eluted by heating with formamide
(Supplementary Fig. 1d), and the biotinylated adduct had a minimal inhibitory effect on
PCR at 5–25% hmC density (delay of approximately 0.1 cycles per converted 5hmC
residue; Supplementary Fig. 1f). There was no PCR delay with CMS-containing PCR
amplicons except at very high CMS levels (Supplementary Fig. 1e), consistent with our

where multiple CMS adducts occur in a row13.

We investigated the genome-wide localization of 5hmC in murine V6.5 ES cells. For GLIBtreated DNA, we chose Helicos single molecule DNA sequencing, which does not require an
amplification step and thus avoids PCR bias14,15. For CMS-enriched genomic DNA, we
used an Illumina instrument, as longer read lengths are needed for efficient alignment of
bisulphite-treated DNA to the genome16. With the GLIB method, 119,600 regions of the
genome, averaging 1,422 bp in length, showed a substantially higher density of reads in the
+BGT as opposed to the −BGT sample; with the CMS method, comparison of enriched to
input DNA identified 109,264 enriched regions (average length 1,168 bp). There was high
overlap in the enriched regions, here designated 5hmC-enriched regions of the genome
(HERGs) (Fig. 1g). Comparing the number of HERGs retrieved by using different fractions
of aligned reads yielded a curve that approached an asymptote, suggesting that a majority of
hydroxymethylated regions had been identified (Supplementary Fig. 2a).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To determine whether HERGs overlapped with methylated DNA regions, we identified
62,991 5mC-enriched regions of the genome (MERGs) by MeDIP. The resulting 5mC
profile does not represent a complete map of 5mC in mouse ES cells, but rather is biased
towards regions of dense methylation. Statistics pertaining to the GLIB, anti-CMS and
MeDIP enrichments are shown in Supplementary Figs 2b–d, the corresponding annotations
are provided in Supplementary Tables 4–9, and reads and enrichment for the Hoxb locus are
provided in Supplementary Table 10. As expected, both HERGs and MERGs contained a
high frequency of CG sequences relative to the genome at large (Supplementary Fig. 3a).
Intriguingly, HERGs also contained relatively high levels of CAG sequences, the most
frequent site of non-CpG methylation in human ES cells16, and we confirmed that the TET1
catalytic domain is capable of hydroxylating 5mC in CHG and CHH (H = A, T or C)
contexts in vitro (Supplementary Fig. 3b).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Analysis of the GLIB and anti-CMS HERG sets gave very similar results. We observed a
strong correlation between the densities of HERGs and genes on a given chromosome; this
trend was less pronounced for MERGs (Fig. 2a). When we compared the distribution of
HERGs and MERGs to the distribution of DNA fragments of equivalent length distributed
randomly across the genome, both 5hmC and 5mC were enriched within transcribed regions,
particularly exons, which are known to be sites of high CpG density17 as well as high DNA
methylation18 (Fig. 2b and Supplementary Fig. 3c). However, only 5hmC was enriched at
transcription start sites (TSSs) and within the 5′ untranslated regions (UTRs) of genes (Fig.
2c). Moreover, 5hmC was relatively more enriched in enhancers (defined by H3K4me1 in
the absence of H3K4me3)19 than 5mC, strongly indicating a connection between 5hmC and
regulatory elements (Fig. 2c). Plotting each HERG as a single point relative to the nearest
TSS, we found that 5hmC is heavily enriched both 5′ and 3′ of the TSS, whereas 5mC is
enriched primarily 3′ of the TSS (Fig. 2d). These results show a unique distribution of 5hmC
in regulatory elements of genes, one that is not explained simply by the distribution of 5mC,
the substrate for TET enzymes.
The enrichment of 5hmC at the TSS suggested a role for 5hmC in transcriptional regulation.
To evaluate this possibility, we used published data sets on gene expression20,21 and histone
modification22,23 profiles in mouse ES cells to compare the sets of genes with 5hmC or 5mC
at their start sites (Supplementary Tables 11–13) to the set of all genes in the genome. 5hmC
is preferentially found at promoters with high or intermediate CpG content (Supplementary
Fig. 4a), even though high CpG promoters are hypomethylated in ES cells16,18,24. This
distribution is consistent with the possibility that TET proteins are preferentially recruited to
high CpG regions through their CpG-binding CXXC domains6,25.

In ES cells, genes with ‘bivalent’ H3K27 and H3K4 trimethylation are transcriptionally
inactive but poised for expression upon differentiation to embryoid bodies20,26,27. We found
that genes with 5hmC at their start sites were disproportionately likely to contain bivalent
domains at their promoters; likewise, a majority (~60%) of genes reported to contain
bivalent domains have 5hmC at their start sites (Fig. 3a). 5hmC was less likely to be found
at genes with the activating ‘H3K4me3 only’ mark than is predicted by chance. Moreover,
genes with 5hmC at their start sites showed lower expression in murine ES cells than other
genes (Fig. 3b) and were more likely to be upregulated upon embryoid body differentiation
(Fig. 3c). The correlation of 5hmC with bivalent domains holds even after adjusting for the
known relation between promoter CpG content and bivalency22 (Supplementary Fig. 5).
Although 5mC at the TSS also correlates with lower gene expression in murine ES cells
(Supplementary Fig. 4b), 5mC is not enriched at the promoters of genes with bivalent
domains28 (Supplementary Fig. 4c), and genes with high levels of 5mC did not tend to be
upregulated upon embryoid body differentiation (Supplementary Fig. 4d). Thus 5hmC is
preferentially enriched at the promoters of genes with bivalent histone marks in ES cells,
indicating that 5hmC may contribute functionally to the ‘poised’ but inactive state of these
genes in ES cells.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Genes with 5hmC at their start sites are also disproportionately enriched in the set of genes
whose promoters bind polycomb repressor complex (PRC) components, and in a majority of
genes with the ‘H3K27me3’ only mark (Fig. 3a). There is a statistically significant
correlation between genes that had 5hmC at the TSS and genes that were upregulated upon
small interfering RNA-mediated Tet1 depletion8 (therefore, negatively regulated by Tet1)
(Fig. 3d), indicating that 5hmC in the promoter region has a negative role in the transcription
of some genes in ES cells. Unlike 5mC, however, 5hmC is not substantially enriched at sites
of heterochromatic H3K9 or H4K20 trimethylation22 (data not shown).
Collectively, our results support a model in which 5hmC and 5mC have different roles in
transcription. Like 5mC28, 5hmC at promoters is predictive of lower levels of gene
expression. However, 5hmC is uniquely associated with a ‘poised’ chromatin configuration
and with genes that are upregulated upon differentiation, and may thus be involved in
priming loci for rapid activation in response to appropriate signals. Activation of lineagespecific genetic loci upon differentiation could occur via a postulated 5mC ‘demethylation’
pathway (5mC to 5hmC to cytosine)1 or through recruitment of transcriptional regulators
that specifically recognize 5hmC and are activated in response to differentiation signals. The
ability to profile 5hmC even at sparsely hydroxymethylated loci will allow a careful
evaluation of these possibilities in differentiating cells.

CMS precipitation

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The generation of the anti-CMS antibody is described elsewhere5. DNA fragments were
ligated with methylated adaptors and treated with sodium bisulphite (Qiagen). The DNA
was then denatured for 10 min at 95 °C (0.4 M NaOH, 10 mM EDTA), neutralized by
addition of cold 2 M ammonium acetate pH 7.0, incubated with anti-CMS antiserum in 1×
immunoprecipitation buffer (10 mM sodium phosphate pH 7.0, 140 mM NaCl, 0.05% Triton
X-100) for 2 h at 4 °C, and then precipitated with Protein G beads. Precipitated DNA was
eluted with Proteinase K, purified by phenol-chloroform extraction, and amplified by 4–6
cycles PCR using Pfu TurboCx hotstart DNA polymerase (Stratagene). DNA sequencing
was carried out using Illumina/Solexa Genome Analyzer II and HiSeq sequencing systems.
