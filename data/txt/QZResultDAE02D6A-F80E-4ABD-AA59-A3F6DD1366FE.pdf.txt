BACKGROUND. The current study was conducted to determine whether there
were differences in outcome for patients with unresectable locally advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC) who received treatment with chemoradiation therapy (CR)
versus induction chemotherapy followed by CR (CCR).

METHODS. Between December 1993 and July 2005, 323 consecutive patients with
LAPC were treated at the authors’ institution with radiotherapy and concurrent
gemcitabine or fluoropyrimidine chemotherapy. Two hundred forty-seven
patients received CR as initial treatment, and 76 patients received a median of
2.5 months of gemcitabine-based induction chemotherapy prior to CR. Most
patients received a radiation dose of 30 grays in 10 fractions (85%) concurrently
with infusional 5-fluorouracil (41%), gemcitabine (39%), or capecitabine (20%).

RESULTS. The median follow-up was 5.5 months (range, 1–63 months). For all

were 9 months and 5 months, respectively, and the 2-year estimated OS and PFS
rates were 9% and 5%, respectively. The median OS and PFS were 8.5 months
respectively, in the CCR group (both P < .001). The median times to local and
distant progression were 6.0 months and 5.6 months, respectively, in the CR
P 5 .007, respectively). There was no significant difference in the patterns of failure with the use of induction chemotherapy.

CONCLUSIONS. The results from this analysis indicated that, by excluding patients
with rapid distant progression, induction chemotherapy may select patients with
LAPC for optimal benefit from consolidative CR. The authors believe that this
strategy of enriching the population of patients who receive a locoregional treatment modality merits prospective randomized evaluation. Cancer 2007;110:47–

ancreatic cancer is the third most common gastrointestinal
malignancy and the fourth leading cause of cancer death in the
U.S.1 Two-thirds of all patients with pancreatic cancer have radiographically detectable metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis.
Among patients without metastatic disease, surgery, the only potentially curative treatment, confers a 15% to 25% 5-year overall survival (OS) rate.2 However, <10% of patients are eligible for surgery.
Even patients who have undergone surgical resection have up to an
80% risk of both distant and local failure. This highlights the high
rate of occult metastases even in seemingly localized disease.3,4

are ineligible for surgery comprise a heterogeneous group with disease that is defined as locally
advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC).5
Patients with LAPC frequently are treated with chemoradiotherapy in the U.S. This approach is based
on the results from a study that was published
approximately 25 years ago in which it was reported
that the addition of chemotherapy to radiotherapy
nearly doubled the median survival from 5.5 months
to 10 months.6 Radiotherapy techniques and fractionation have evolved since then along with chemotherapy regimens. However, there are no universally
accepted, standard guidelines for the treatment of
patients with LAPC. During the past 5 years, there
has been a general shift in the treatment strategy for
LAPC at our institution from the fairly routine use of
chemoradiotherapy alone (CR) to initial treatment
with induction chemotherapy followed by consolidation chemoradiotherapy (CCR). This was based on
the recognized metastatic potential of pancreatic
cancer and the greater efficacy of newer chemotherapy regimens for metastatic disease. However, the
potential benefit of this strategy has not been evaluated formally. Here, we report the results of a systematic analysis of the impact of induction
chemotherapy on overall outcomes for patients with
LAPC.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Between December 1993 and July 2005, 370 consecutive patients received chemoradiotherapy for
nonmetastatic LAPC, which initially deemed unresectable for cure, at the University of Texas M. D.
Anderson Cancer Center. Among those patients, 47
were excluded from the current analysis, because
they received protocol therapy with bevacizumab
during radiotherapy and were reported previously.7
The remaining patients received traditional radiosensitizers (fluoropyrimidines or gemcitabine) with their
radiotherapy. Seventy-six patients received CCR. The
remaining 247 patients received CR. Patient characteristics are summarized in Table 1. The Institutional
Review Board approved this retrospective analysis.

Pretreatment Evaluation
Patients were evaluated by a dedicated multidisciplinary team, which included a medical oncologist, a
radiation oncologist, and a surgical oncologist.
Tumors that extended to the celiac axis or the superior mesenteric artery or tumors that occluded the
superior mesenteric venous (SMV)-portal venous
confluence were deemed locally advanced and unresectable based on a review of the computed tomo-

graphy (CT) images. Tumors that involved only the
SMV were deemed potentially resectable at our institution and, thus, were excluded from the study.

Treatment
Treatment characteristics are summarized in Table 1.
Patients in the CCR group received a median of 2.5
months of induction chemotherapy prior to chemoradiation. Most patients (N 5 276; 85%) received the
median radiation dose of 30 grays (Gy) in 10 fractions over 2 weeks (3 Gy per fraction) using a 4-field
technique. Thirty-four patients (11%) received a
more traditional radiation regimen of 45 Gy in 25
fractions with a 5.4-Gy boost to 50.4 Gy over 5 or 6
weeks (1.8 Gy per fraction). In 2001, we eliminated
the routine use of elective lymph node irradiation in
patients with LAPC to reduce toxicity. Fields targeted
the primary tumor and regional lymph nodes in the
majority of patients (N 5 224; 69%); and, in the
remaining patients, fields targeted the primary tumor
only (N 5 99; 31%).
During induction chemotherapy, most patients
(N 5 56; 74%) received a combination of gemcitabine and cisplatin, and 12 patients (15%) received
gemcitabine alone. The dose of gemcitabine was 750
mg/m2 (range, 450–1000 mg/m2) weekly for patients
who received gemcitabine alone and every 2 weeks
for those who received gemcitabine and cisplatin.
The dose of cisplatin was 25 to 30 mg/m2 every 2
weeks.
Concurrent chemotherapy with radiotherapy for
all patients consisted of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) (41%),
gemcitabine (39%), and capecitabine (20%). Gemcitabine was administered at 350 to 400 mg/m2 infused
over 30 minutes once a week for 7 weeks starting 24
to 48 hours after the first radiation dose. 5-FU was
given as a continuous infusion of 300 mg/m2 daily.
Capecitabine was given at 800 to 900 mg/m2 in divided doses twice daily on days when radiotherapy
was administered. Chemotherapy dose adjustments
were based on previously published criteria.8

Follow-up
Patients were scheduled for follow-up visits with a
medical or radiation oncologist at least every 3 to 4
months for the first 2 years. Abdominopelvic CT
scans and chest x-rays were obtained at these visits
to monitor diseases status. The use of serum markers
(CA 19-9) during follow-up was variable and dependent on the individual physician. Therapy was individualized at the time of progression.

15 Gy were grouped with the 30-Gy group.

Endpoints
The endpoints of this study were OS, progressionfree survival (PFS), local progression, distant progression, and toxicity. PFS, local progression, and distant
progression were determined retrospectively using
formal interpretations of all follow-up radiographic
imaging data reviewed by diagnostic radiologists.
Wherever lesions were reported as indeterminate,
these were not coded as progression. Evidence of
progression at the primary site on radiographic imaging was considered local progression. Evidence of
progression at distant sites included the development
of radiographically visible peritoneal, liver, lung, and
other systemic metastases. Severe toxicity was coded
using the criteria reported previously.8

Statistical Analysis
Survival was calculated from the first day of treatment (chemotherapy for CCR patients and chemoradiotherapy for CR patients). PFS was censored at the
date of the last follow-up on record if no recurrences
were observed and the patient remained alive. All
statistics are actuarial and were calculated from the
date of initial treatment. The significance of differences in proportions was calculated with a chisquare test, and the differences in means were calculated with a Student t test. Survival probabilities were
estimated nonparametrically using the Kaplan-Meier
product-limit method.9 Comparisons between groups
were performed with a log-rank test.10 Each variable

univariate analysis was used in the multivariate
model. Cox proportional-hazards modeling was used
to examine the effect of induction chemotherapy and
other factors on the time to progression and survival.11 All tests were 2-sided, and P values .05 were
considered statistically significant.

RESULTS
Overall Treatment Outcomes
The median follow-up was 5.5 months (range, 1–63
months) for all patients and 6.7 months (range, 1–63
months) among the 44 surviving patients. For the
whole group, the median OS was 9.1 months (range,
1–78 months), and the median PFS was 5.0 months
(range, 1–63 months) (Fig. 1). The estimated OS rates
at the end of 1 year and 2 years were 28% and 9%,
respectively, and the estimated PFS rates at the end
of 1 year and 2 years were 13% and 5%, respectively
(Fig. 1). At the time of analysis, 279 patients had
died, 275 from primary cancer and 4 from other
causes. Nine patients (3%; 7 patients from the CR
group and 2 patients from the CCR group) were able
to undergo margin-negative resections. These patients had a median OS of 29.4 months (range, 5.6–
63 months) and a median PFS of 20 months (range,
5.6–63 months). With a median interval of 0.6
months between diagnosis and treatment, the median OS and PFS from the date of diagnosis were 10
months and 5.7 months, respectively.

tion fractionation, concurrent chemotherapy regimen, and use of induction chemotherapy. On
univariate analysis, the prognostic factors for
improved OS were KPS >80 (P < .001), weight loss
<5% in the preceding 3 months (P 5 .024), Hgb 12
g/dL (P 5 .004), and the use of induction chemotherapy (P < .001). The significant prognostic factors for
PFS were the use of induction chemotherapy (P <
.001), KPS >80 (P 5 .004), and Hgb 12 g/dL
(P 5 .001). On multivariate analysis (Table 3), the use
of induction chemotherapy (P < .001), KPS (P < .001),
and Hgb (P 5 .006) remained the only independent
prognostic factors for OS. Similarly, the use of induction chemotherapy (P < .001), KPS (P 5 .006), and
Hgb (P 5 .003) were independent prognostic factors
for PFS on multivariate analysis.

Outcomes Analysis by Treatment Group
The use of induction chemotherapy was an independent prognostic factor for OS and PFS. The estimated OS was 8.5 months in the CR group and 11.9
months in the CCR group (P < .001) (Fig. 2). The median PFS was 4.2 months in the CR group and 6.4
months in the CCR group (P < .001) (Fig. 3). The median time to local progression was 6 months in the
CR group and 8.9 in the CCR group (P 5 .003). The
median time to distant progression was 5.6 months

(P 5 .007).

Patterns of Failure
Of the 323 patients in our series, 231 patients developed recurrent disease. The anatomic sites of recurrence (occurring at any time after initial treatment)
and the sites of first failure are shown in Table 3.
Local progression, with or without distant progression, was observed in 117 patients (47%) in the CR
group and in 31 patients (41%) in the CCR group
(P 5 .31). Isolated local progression occurred in 44
patients (18%) in the CR group and in 12 patients
(16%) in the CCR group (P 5 .68). Distant disease as
the only component of recurrence was not significantly different between the CR group and the CCR
group (24% vs 29%, respectively; P 5 .38). The most
frequent sites of distant failure in both groups were
liver, peritoneum, and lung. There was no signifi-

Toxicity During Chemotherapy and/or Chemoradiotherapy
In the CCR group, 15 of 76 patients (20%) developed
severe acute toxicity. One patient developed gemcitabine-induced pneumonitis, and the remaining
patients were admitted for supportive care for intractable nausea/vomiting and failure to thrive. In the
CR group, 22 of 81 patients (27%) who received gemcitabine and 10 of 133 patients (8%) who received 5FU developed severe acute toxicity (P < .001). Only 1
patient who received capecitabine developed severe
toxicity and required total parenteral nutrition for intractable nausea and vomiting. Among the 10
patients who received 5-FU, 8 patients had to be
admitted for supportive care, and 2 patients had gastrointestinal bleeding. The patients who had severe
toxicity from gemcitabine included 4 patients with
gastrointestinal bleeding and 14 patients who were
admitted for the management of intractable nausea/
vomiting.

DISCUSSION
To our knowledge, the current study is the first to
analyze systematically the association between
induction chemotherapy, treatment outcomes, and
patterns of failure after chemoradiotherapy for
patients with LAPC. We report that induction gemcitabine-based chemotherapy followed by chemoradiotherapy appears to provide more promising
clinical outcomes than chemoradiotherapy alone for
LAPC. There is no difference in local or distant metastasis rates between the 2 groups. We believe the

52

improvement in survival is achieved by eliminating
patients who have micrometastases that progress
during the induction phase, thereby enriching the
population of patients for treatment with a localized
therapy, such as CCR.
Chemoradiotherapy with 5-FU has been used as
the standard treatment regimen since early randomized trials by the Gastrointestinal Trials Study
Group demonstrated nearly 2 decades ago that the
combination of chemotherapy and radiotherapy was
more effective than chemotherapy or radiotherapy
alone.6,12 Multiple attempts have been made to
improve outcomes further in this patient population.
One strategy has been the use of newer chemotherapeutic regimens with greater systemic activity as radiosensitizers. Although few initial trials had
higher toxicities with gemcitabine at doses from 400
to 1000 mg/m2 per week,13–15 the toxicity of gemcitabine can be reduced by using a lower dose of gemcitabine or by reducing the radiation dose and
volume.8,16,17 Other cytotoxic agents, either alone or
in combination, have failed to demonstrate convincing and consistent improvements in clinical outcomes.18–25 Newer targeted agents that target various
stages of tumor growth and spread may prove useful
in combination with standard chemotherapy and/or
radiotherapy.7,26–28
An alternative strategy that has been employed is
radiation dose-intensification.29,30 However, the proximity of pancreatic cancers to duodenal and other
bowel loops limits the ability to safely escalate the
dose of radiotherapy. An offshoot of this approach is
one in which the escalated dose of radiation is confined to the tumor surrounding major vessels or the
retroperitoneal surface in an attempt to render the
tumor surgically resectable with negative margins.
Early reports suggest that this is technically feasible,
but its efficacy remains to be established.31
Another strategy that has been employed is sequential therapy. A French Phase III trial that compared initial CR (intermittent cisplatin and infusional
5-FU) followed by gemcitabine versus gemcitabine
alone in patients with LAPC recently was reported.32
Patients who were treated with this strategy of chemoradiotherapy followed by chemotherapy reportedly had inferior survival compared with patients
who received chemotherapy alone (1-year overall
survival, 24% vs 51%; median survival, 8.4 months vs
14.3 months; P 5 .014).
For the current study, we analyzed a new strategy of sequentially administering chemotherapy followed by chemoradiotherapy for LAPC. This
approach of introducing the systemic treatment
(chemotherapy) prior to locoregional treatment (sur-

gery or radiotherapy) has been investigated in other
gastrointestinal cancers, such as esophageal, gastric,
rectal, and anal cancers, with varying degrees of success.33–37 The high incidence of occult micrometastatic disease at the time of diagnosis and the more
gratifying responses observed with newer chemotherapeutic agents compared with older, single-agent
fluoropyrimidines makes this approach particularly
beneficial for the treatment of LAPC. The efficacy of
this strategy does not necessarily rely on the
increased systemic potency of the induction chemotherapy regimen, but the induction regimen merely
may serve as a therapeutic screening test for the inherent biology of LAPC that initially is deemed to
have no radiographically identifiable metastatic disease. Patients who fail this screening test because of
systemic progression are most likely to be patients
who already had micrometastatic disease and were
never optimal candidates for a locoregional treatment such as chemoradiotherapy. This strategy
serves to select preferentially for CCR the patients
who are most likely to benefit from a locoregional
therapy. In this series, the incorporation of induction
chemotherapy prior to chemoradiotherapy did not
seem to increase toxicity or the ability to administer
the planned chemoradiation regimen.
There are other theoretical advantages to the
induction approach other than the eradication of
micrometastatic disease and the prediction of biologic behavior of tumors. It may be postulated that
chemotherapy causes shrinkage of tumors, rendering
them more likely to respond to subsequent chemoradiotherapy; that drug delivery is better in untreated,
well-vascularized tumors; and that the response to
induction chemotherapy may guide the choice of
chemotherapy regimen used either with radiotherapy
and/or subsequently.
Limitations of our study include those common
to retrospective studies that use data abstracted from
patient records. These data sources tend to capture
incomplete information regarding toxicity, although
the incompleteness most likely is distributed equally
across both the CR group and the CCR group.
Because they were retrospective in nature, the data
on tumor markers, tumor grade, and reasons for
unresectability were not available for all patients. We
acknowledge that 1 source of bias is the inability to
identify or include patients who progressed while
they were undergoing induction chemotherapy. Our
experience with resectable pancreatic cancers has
demonstrated that approximately 25% of patients
who receive neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy are
found to have disease progression (predominantly
liver metastases) at the time of restaging prior to

because of disease progression. The ability to identify and exclude patients who have rapidly progressive disease prior to chemoradiotherapy improves
the median survival duration of the group of
patients who undergo chemoradiation. Therefore,
this series represents the treatment outcomes for
patients who received chemoradiation following this
selection strategy rather than that for all patients
who received induction chemotherapy. An additional
source of bias is the possibility that patients who
had more symptomatic (and, thus, possibly more
advanced) disease were chosen for CR, whereas
patients who had more favorable constitutional
and/or tumor-related characteristics were chosen for
CCR. We have attempted to account for all known
confounders, and there did not seem to be a noticeable difference in their distribution across these 2
groups. However, this does not discount the possibility that unknown confounders could have served
as a source of bias. The changes in imaging quality
(improvement in the ability to detect small metastases with newer, cross-sectional CT imaging and contrast-enhancement protocols) and radiotherapy
techniques and the use of additional supportive
care measures in later years (such as the more prevalent use of newer generation antiemetics and colony-stimulating factors) during this period may
have introduced unknown confounding factors.
Finally, the fact that the majority of induction
chemotherapy patients received gemcitabine as the
radiosensitizing chemotherapy regimen should not
influence the outcomes, because previous studies
from our institution have demonstrated that the
type of concurrent chemotherapy regimen does not
independently change survival.8
The major strength of this study is the large sample size of patients who were treated by a dedicated
multidisciplinary team at a single institution. The
multidisciplinary approach engenders considerable
uniformity in 1) accurate radiographic staging, 2)
safe and efficient means of obtaining a tissue diagnosis and relieving biliary obstruction, 3) adherence to
a strict definition of resectability, 4) consistent treatment approaches (chemotherapy doses and techniques), and 5) standardized posttreatment follow-up.
In addition, the systematic analysis of patterns of
failure aids our comprehension of the mechanism
of action of induction chemotherapy. To our knowledge, the current report is the only comparison of
chemoradiation alone versus induction chemotherapy in patients with LAPC, and it may serve as a

53

means to generate a testable hypothesis that will
need to be evaluated prospectively.
An ideal induction chemotherapy regimen
should have high efficacy in controlling occult metastatic disease, the ability to shrink tumors before
consolidative locoregional therapy, convenient dosing
schedule, minimal toxicity, and optimal duration to
avoid undue delay of locoregional therapy. One area
of concern is that a prolonged course of systemic
chemotherapy, especially when gratifying responses
in tumor markers are noted, eventually may cause
local progression or systemic failure, rendering the
locoregional therapy (chemoradiotherapy) less meaningful. To ensure that a possible window of opportunity to integrate chemoradiotherapy into this
treatment paradigm is not lost, it may be worth stipulating that CCR should be administered after
approximately 2 to 3 months of induction chemotherapy, with the optimal duration guided by assessment of CA 19-9 and radiographic images. Such a
strategy of chemoradiation after chemotherapy has
been adopted in the postoperative setting in a
recently reported Phase III trial (Radiation Therapy
Oncology Group 9704) in which patients received adjuvant prechemoradation and postchemoradiation
chemotherapy for resected pancreatic adenocarcinoma.40 Integrating chemotherapy and chemoradiotherapy in this manner for patients with LAPC is
worthy of prospective evaluation.
In conclusion, the use of induction chemotherapy prior to consolidative chemoradiation in patients
with LAPC may select patients who are most likely to
benefit from a local treatment modality. This strategy
of enriching the population of patients who receive a
locoregional treatment modality deserves prospective
randomized evaluation.
