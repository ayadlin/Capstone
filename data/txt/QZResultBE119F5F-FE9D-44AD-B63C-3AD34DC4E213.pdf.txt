ABSTRACT
NPM-ALK+ T-cell anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (ALCL) is an aggressive type of
cancer. Standard treatment of NPM-ALK+ ALCL is CHOP polychemotherapy. Although
patients initially respond favorably to CHOP, resistance, relapse, and death frequently
occur. Recently, selective targeting of ALK has emerged as an alternative therapeutic
strategy. ASP3026 is a second-generation ALK inhibitor that can overcome crizotinib
resistance in non-small cell lung cancer, and is currently being evaluated in clinical
trials of patients with ALK+ solid tumors. However, NPM-ALK+ ALCL patients are not
included in these trials. We studied the effects of ASP3026 on NPM-ALK+ ALCL cell
lines in vitro and on systemic lymphoma growth in vivo. ASP3026 decreased the
viability, proliferation, and colony formation, as well as induced apoptotic cell death
of NPM-ALK+ ALCL cells. In addition, ASP3026 significantly reduced the proliferation
of 293T cells transfected with NPM-ALK mutants that are resistant to crizotinib and
downregulated tyrosine phosphorylation of these mutants. Moreover, ASP3026
abrogated systemic NPM-ALK+ ALCL growth in mice. Importantly, the survival of
ASP3026-treated mice was superior to that of control and CHOP-treated mice. Our
data suggest that ASP3026 is an effective treatment for NPM-ALK+ ALCL, and support
the enrollment of patients with this lymphoma in the ongoing clinical trials.

INTRODUCTION

(p23;q35) that occurs in 85% of ALK+ ALCL cases [3, 4].
This translocation also involves the nucleophosmin (NPM)
gene and induces the generation of the oncogenic tyrosine
kinase NPM-ALK.
NPM is a ubiquitously expressed protein that
shuttles ribonucleoproteins between the nucleolus
and cytoplasm. Unlike ALK, NPM-ALK lacks an
extracellular domain. Nonetheless, NPM-ALK appears to
be constitutively activated by the formation of the NPMALK/NPM-ALK homodimers through the NPM domain.
Wild-type NPM is also involved in the formation of NPM/
NPM-ALK heterodimers that translocate to the nucleus
[5]. Because NPM-ALK is the most widely expressed
ALK chimeric protein and because all established ALK+

Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) is a receptor
tyrosine kinase that is expressed in neuronal cells at an
early stage of human development; therefore, it is assumed
that ALK contributes to neural tissue development [1,
2]. In addition to its physiologic expression, ALK is
aberrantly expressed in several human cancers, including
an aggressive subtype of T-cell lymphoma known as ALKexpressing anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (ALK+ ALCL)
[3]. The expression of ALK in this lymphoma occurs
secondary to one of several chromosomal aberrations
that involve the ALK gene on chromosome 2p23. The
most common of these aberrations is translocation t(2;5)

T-cell ALCL cell lines harbor NPM-ALK, in this paper we
will refer to this lymphoma as NPM-ALK+ ALCL.
Although NPM-ALK+ ALCL represents only 3-5%
of non-Hodgkin lymphomas in adults, it constitutes up
to 40% of these lymphomas in children and adolescents.
NPM-ALK+ ALCL is an aggressive cancer; most
patients present with advanced stage (III/IV) disease,
widespread dissemination, and B symptoms including
high fever, night sweats, and weight loss [3]. There is
no specific therapeutic approach for NPM-ALK+ ALCL,
and it is typically treated with doxorubicin-containing
polychemotherapy such as CHOP (cyclophosphamide,
doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone). A few studies
have systematically analyzed the outcomes of therapeutic
approaches for NPM-ALK+ ALCL, and, not unexpectedly,
most of these studies focused on pediatric patients [6-13].
Patients usually show an initial favorable response to
CHOP; however, 30-40% of the patients in these studies
had multiple relapses and disease/therapy-associated death
remains a common event [7, 12].
Because ALK plays crucial roles in the development
and survival of NPM-ALK+ ALCL [14], targeting ALK is
viewed as a promising strategy for treating NPM-ALK+
ALCL patients [15]. Although selective ALK inhibitors
are being evaluated in clinical trials, most of these trials
focus on ALK+ solid tumors such as non-small cell lung
cancer (NSCLC), neuroblastoma, and inflammatory
myofibroblastic tumor [16-18].
ASP3026
(2-N-[2-methoxy-4-[4-(4methylpiperazin-1-yl)piperidin-1-yl]phenyl]-4-N-(2propan-2-ylsulfonylphenyl)-1,3,5-triazine-2,4-diamine) is
a recently developed, orally available, second-generation
small molecule ALK inhibitor. ASP3026 was identified in
an ALK inhibition assay aimed at the oncogenic fusion
kinase echinoderm-microtubule-associated protein-like
4-ALK (EML4-ALK) that has been detected in a subgroup
of NSCLC patients [19, 20]. Initial studies showed that
ASP3026 possesses remarkable inhibitory effects on
EML4-ALK activity. Preliminary studies in NSCLC
showed that compared with crizotinib (PF-02341066,
Xalkori), an ALK/c-MET/ROS1 inhibitor that has been
approved to treat patients with relapsed ALK+ NSCLC,
ASP3026 is more tolerable and more potent in inhibiting
EML4-ALK [20]. Importantly, crizotinib-resistant EML4ALK mutants were not resistant to the effects of ASP3026
[20-23].
Because of these encouraging results, ASP3026
is currently being evaluated in clinical trials (http://
clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT01401504; http://clinicaltrials.
gov/ct2/show/NCT01284192) that enroll patients with
aggressive ALK+ solid tumors and ALK+ large B-cell
lymphoma, which, compared with NPM-ALK+ T-cell
ALCL, is a very rare entity with less than 40 patients
reported [24]. A preliminary analysis concluded that
ASP3026 possesses promising safety and pharmacokinetic
profiles [25]. Although NPM-ALK+ ALCL was the first
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

type of cancer in which ALK was identified, the effects of
ASP3026 have not been evaluated in this neoplasm. More
importantly, NPM-ALK+ ALCL patients are not eligible
for enrollment in the ongoing trials.
Herein, we sought to perform a systematic in vitro
analysis of the effects of ASP3026 on NPM-ALK+ ALCL
cells. In addition, we developed and utilized a systemic
xenograft NPM-ALK+ ALCL model in SCID mice to
examine the effects of this inhibitor in vivo. Our data
provide strong evidence that ASP3026 is an efficacious
treatment for the aggressive NPM-ALK+ ALCL, and
support the inclusion of NPM-ALK+ ALCL patients in the
ongoing clinical trials.

RESULTS
ASP3026 decreases NPM-ALK+ ALCL cell
viability
At 48 h, ASP3026 induced concentration-dependent
decreases in the viability of all NPM-ALK+ ALCL cell
lines tested, as measured by MTS assay (Fig. 1A). DEL
cells, particularly at lower concentrations of 0.1, 0.5, and
1.0 µM, demonstrated less sensitivity to ASP3026 than the
other cell lines. The IC50 was 0.4 µM in SU-DHL-1, 0.75
in SUP-M2, 1.0 in SR-786, 2.5 in Karpas 299, and > 3.0
in DEL cell lines. Similar effects were not observed in the
T lymphocytes that were used as a negative control and
the decrease in the viability of the lymphoma cells was
significantly greater than the decrease in the viability of
the T lymphocytes. The decrease in cell viability became
more pronounced at 72 h, and the IC50 was 0.3 µM in SUDHL-1, 0.5 in DEL, 0.75 in SUP-M2 and SR-786, and 2.5
in Karpas 299 (Fig. 1B).

ASP3026 induces apoptosis in NPM-ALK+ ALCL
cells
Analysis of apoptosis by flow cytometry after dual
staining with annexin V-FITC and PI showed that at 48
h ASP3026 (0.5, 1.5, and 2.5 µM) induced significant
apoptosis in Karpas 299, SR-786, and SU-DHL-1 cells
(Figure 1C). Apoptosis was also documented by Giemsa
staining (Figure 1D).

ASP3026 decreases the proliferation of NPMALK+ ALCL cells
Karpas 299, SR-786, and SU-DHL-1 cells were
treated with ASP3026 and changes in cell proliferation
were measured using a BrdU assay. At 48 h, concentrationdependent decreases in cell proliferation were noted in the
3 cell lines (Figure 1E).

induced concentration-dependent decreases in the viability of NPM-ALK+ ALCL cells, as measured by MTS assay. These effects were
not detected in T lymphocytes, and the decrease in the viability of NPM-ALK+ ALCL cells was statistically significant compared to T
lymphocytes (at 0.1 µM concentration: P < 0.05 in SU-DHL-1, P < 0.01 in Karpas 299, P = 0.0001 in SR-786, P < 0.0001 in SUP-M2, P >

0.5 µM: P < 0.0001 in all cell lines compared with T lymphocytes). (C) Treatment of the NPM-ALK+ ALCL cells Karpas 299, SR-786, and
SU-DHL-1 with ASP3026 for 48 h was associated with significant concentration-dependent increases in apoptotic cell death, as measured
by flow cytometry after cellular staining with annexin V/PI (*: P < 0.0001 compared with vehicle-treated control cells). (D) Morphologic
features associated with apoptotic cell death, including cellular shrinkage and nuclear condensation and fragmentation, are shown in Karpas

ASP3026 abrogates anchorage-independent
colony formation of NPM-ALK+ ALCL cells

blotting results showed that ASP3026 downregulated
pNPM-ALK at Y646 and Y664 (Figure 2B). Moreover,
ASP3026 induced remarkable downregulation of the
phosphorylation of several survival-promoting proteins
that are known to be activated by NPM-ALK including
IGF-IR, STAT3, AKT, and JNK (Figure 2B). The
occurrence of apoptosis after treatment with ASP3026
was biochemically supported by cleavage of caspase 3 and
PARP (Figure 2B).

Figure 1F shows that treatment with ASP3026 for
48 h induced concentration-dependent decreases in colony
numbers in Karpas 299, SR-786, and SU-DHL-1 cells
grown for 5 days in methylcellulose. This experiment
showed that SU-DHL-1 cells were most sensitive to the
effects of ASP3026. Representative images of colonies
from untreated cells, cells treated with vehicle, and cells
treated with ASP3026 are shown in Figure 1G. Compared
with cells treated with vehicle or untreated cells, NPMALK+ ALCL cells treated with ASP3026 developed
remarkably fewer colonies.

ASP3026 decreases the proliferation of 293T cells
transfected with crizotinib-resistant NPM-ALK
mutants
To test whether ASP3026 can overcome the
resistance to crizotinib, we used crizotinib or ASP3026 to
treat 293T cells transiently transfected with NPM-ALK,
NPM-ALKI231N or NPM-ALKL256Q. Not surprisingly,
crizotinib (Figure 3A) and ASP3026 (Figure 3B) induced
concentration-dependent decrease in the proliferation of
cells transfected with NPM-ALK. Whereas ASP3026
efficiently decreased the proliferation of cells transfected
with NPM-ALKI231N or NPM-ALKL256Q, crizotinib failed to
induce similar effects. To further analyze the differential
effects of crizotinib and ASP3026, we studied the changes
in pNPM-ALK levels. Indeed, crizotinib and ASP3026
caused marked downregulation of pNPM-ALK at Y664 in
293T cells transfected with NPM-ALK. Nonetheless, only

ASP3026 reduces the tyrosine kinase activity of
NPM-ALK and its phosphorylation levels and
induces significant alterations in downstream
targets of NPM-ALK signaling
To seek an explanation for the negative biological
impact of ASP3026 in NPM-ALK+ ALCL cells, we
measured NPM-ALK tyrosine kinase activity and
phosphorylation levels after treatment with ASP3026.
ASP3026 induced marked decreases in the tyrosine
kinase activity of NPM-ALK in Karpas 299, SR-786,
and SU-DHL-1 cells (Figure 2A). Furthermore, Western

Figure 2: ASP3026 reduces the tyrosine kinase activity of NPM-ALK, downregulates the phosphorylation of NPMALK and target proteins, and induces biochemical effects consistent with apoptosis. (A) ASP3026 induced a marked
decrease in NPM-ALK tyrosine kinase activity in the lymphoma cells (*: P < 0.01, **: P < 0.001, ***: P < 0.0001 compared with control
cells treated with vehicle). Results shown are means ± SE of 3 experiments. (B) ASP3026 decreased the phosphorylation of NPM-ALK at
2 different tyrosine residues: Y646 and Y664. Also, treatment with ASP3026 was associated with downregulation of the phosphorylation
of the NPM-ALK target proteins IGF-IR, STAT3, AKT, and JNK. Changes in the basal levels of these proteins were not detected. The
occurrence of apoptosis was biochemically supported by the increase in cleaved caspase-3 and cleaved PARP and the simultaneous decrease
in non-cleaved caspase-3 and non-cleared PARP levels. β-Actin indicates equal loading of the proteins.

lymphoma regression at 2 weeks after treatment initiation.
Mice treated uninterruptedly with ASP3026 demonstrated
complete remission with no relapse or lymphoma-related
death. Representative examples are shown in Figure 4B
(lanes 1 & 2). Notably, ALCL relapsed as early as 1 week
after interruption of ASP3026 (examples shown in Figure
4B; lanes 3-6). Two mice with relapse were euthanized at
week 8 owing to heavy tumor burden (Figure 4B; lanes
3 & 4). At week 9, ASP3026 was re-administered to the
other 3 mice; their tumors substantially regressed and they
lived until study termination (examples shown in Figure
4B; lanes 5 & 6). The inhibitory effects of ASP3026 on
NPM-ALK+ ALCL growth were attributable, at least in

cells transfected with EV were treated with ASP3026. Results represent the means ± SE of 3 experiments. (C) The left panel shows that
crizotinib decreased the phosphorylation of NPM-ALK transfected in 293T cells, but not the phosphorylation of NPM-ALKI231N or NPMALKL256Q. At the other hand, ASP3026 reduced the phosphorylation of the three constructs. The levels of non-phosphorylated NPM-ALK
constructs and β-actin support equal protein loading. The right panel illustrates lack of NPM-ALK/pNPM-ALK protein expression in 293T
cells transfected with EV. (D) Densitometric analysis depicting the ratio of pNPM-ALK Western blot bands to their corresponding NPMALK bands is shown. The results illustrate that crizotinib induced remarkable downregulation of pNPM-ALK in 293T cells transfected with
NPM-ALK but not in 293T cells transfected with crizotinib-resistant NPM-ALK mutants. (E) Furthermore, the densitometric analysis also
shows that treatment with ASP3026 caused concentration-dependent decrease in pNPM-ALK levels in cells transfected with NPM-ALK,

were monitored weekly using bioluminescence imaging. The intensity of the signal is indicated by color (blue: low; green: intermediate;

no relapse until study termination at week 13. Administration of ASP3026 was interrupted in 5 mice (examples in lanes 3-6) for 4 weeks.
Notably, ALCL relapsed as early as 1 week after discontinuation of ASP3026. Two mice (lanes 3 & 4) had to be euthanized before the study
period ended because of relapsed NPM-ALK+ ALCL with extensive tumor burden. At week 9, ASP3026 was re-administered in the other
3 mice (2 shown in lanes 5 & 6), and the NPM-ALK+ ALCL tumors substantially regressed, and the mice survived until termination of the
study. (C) Bioluminescence imaging highlights the NPM-ALK+ ALCL tumors in control and ASP3026-treated mice (upper panels). Mice
were injected intraperitoneally by the firefly luciferase prosubstrate VivoGlo Caspase-3/7 and bioluminescence imaging was performed.
Tumors in control mice treated only with vehicle failed to demonstrate significant apoptosis signals (left lower panel). In contrast, intense
signals consistent with marked in vivo lymphoma cell apoptosis were detected in mice treated with ASP3026 (right lower panel). (D)
Examples of control mice showing lymphoma (red arrows) in cervical lymph nodes (a, exterior; b, dissected); inguinal lymph nodes (c, d);
mesenteric lymph nodes (e); and axillary lymph nodes (f). Example of cervical lymph nodes is shown in a mouse treated interruptedly with
ASP3026 (group I). After relapse, this mouse received ASP3026, survived, and was euthanized at the end of the study. A small cervical
lymph node (red arrow) was detected at necropsy (g). This lymph node was processed and microscopically examined as shown in Figure
3E, lower panel. Example of cervical lymph nodes is shown after relapse in a mouse treated interruptedly with ASP3026. The lymph
nodes comprised large, bulky tumor masses (red arrows) (h). (E) Histologic sections from cervical lymph node obtained from a control
mouse treated with vehicle show effacement of the normal nodal architecture by solid sheets of lymphoma cells (H&E staining; original
magnification: ×100). Higher magnification shows large cells with abundant cytoplasm, vesicular nuclei, and high mitotic rate with atypical
mitotic figures [red arrowheads] (H&E; ×400). Immunohistochemical staining shows cytoplasmic and nuclear localization of NPM-ALK
protein in the solid sheets of the lymphoma cells. Ki-67 is expressed in the vast majority of the lymphoma cells that diffusely infiltrate the
lymph node. In addition, pSTAT3Y705 and pIGF-IRY1161 are highly expressed in almost all of the lymphoma cells. Also shown are histologic
sections from a small post-treatment cervical lymph node collected at necropsy from a mouse treated with ASP3026 after relapse (I group,
illustrated in Figure 3D, panel g). H&E staining shows small nests of ALCL cells separated by thick stromal tissue strands (×100). Higher
magnification of the same lymph node further illustrates the small clusters of lymphoma cells with rare mitotic figures [yellow arrows]
separated by thick stromal strands that include fibroblasts, small blood vessels, and admixed inflammatory cells [red arrows] (×400).
Although NPM-ALK and Ki-67 were identified in residual ALCL cells, the numbers of these cells were much less pronounced after
treatment. The expressions of pSTAT3 and pIGF-IR are substantially reduced in the lymph node sections from the ASP3026-treated mouse.
Immunohistochemical staining photomicrographs are shown at an original magnification of ×400. (F) Control mice at week 3 (top left)

was confirmed at necropsy (Figure 4D, panels a-f). Figure
4D, panel g, shows a small cervical lymph node from
a mouse from the interrupted (I) ASP3026 group that
developed relapsed lymphoma and thereafter was treated
with ASP3026 and survived until the termination of the

cervical lymph nodes involved with lymphoma in a mouse
from the interrupted ASP3026 group (I) after relapse. This
mouse was euthanized before the end of the study because
of heavy tumor burden.
Histologic examination of tissues obtained from
control mice showed infiltration by solid sheets of

ALK was confirmed by immunohistochemical analysis
(Figure 4E). Ki-67 was expressed in the vast majority of
the lymphoma cells that diffusely infiltrated the tissues.
In addition, strong expressions of pSTAT3 and pIGF-IR
were detected in most of the lymphoma cells (Figure 4E).
Conversely, tissues from a mouse from the interrupted
ASP3026 group (I) that was treated with ASP3026 after

illustrated that treatment with ASP3026 was associated
with marked decrease in the number of tumor cells. Instead

shows that the mean ± SE duration of survival in control mice was 43.1 ± 3.3 days. Mice treated with CHOP lived slightly longer (50.6 ±
6.4 days). In contrast, mice treated with uninterrupted ASP3026 (U) lived 79.8 ± 8.0 days and those treated with interrupted ASP3026 (I)
lived 77.8 ± 8.1 days. Two mice treated with ASP3026 (U) died incidentally at 50 and 76 days because of infection, with no evidence of
lymphoma tumors by imaging or by complete necropsy. In the ASP3026 (I) group, mice developed relapsed lymphoma after the interruption
of ASP3026, and 2 mice were euthanized at 55 and 61 days because of extensive tumor burdens. The other 3 mice received ASP3026 after
relapse and the lymphoma regressed. These mice survived until the termination of the study (*: P < 0.05; **: P < 0.01 vs. ASP3026 [U or
I]). (B) Kaplan-Meier survival curves show that mice treated with ASP3026 (U or I) demonstrated statistically superior overall survival
compared with control mice treated with vehicle or CHOP (P = 0.001 in ASP3026 [U] vs. control or CHOP; P = 0.001 in ASP3026 [I] vs.
control; P = 0.04 in ASP3026 [I] vs. CHOP). Significance differences were not detected between control mice and mice treated with CHOP
or between mice treated with ASP3026 (U) and mice treated with ASP3026 (I).

developed ALK inhibitor ASP3026 in NPM-ALK+ ALCL.
Our in vitro experiments demonstrated that ASP3026
causes a marked decrease in the viability of NPM-ALK+
ALCL cells, which could be at least partially explained
by a significant increase in apoptotic cell death. Also,
ASP3026 induces a significant decrease in cellular
proliferation and anchorage-independent colony formation
in NPM-ALK+ ALCL. Although all of the NPM-ALK+
ALCL cell lines used in this study demonstrated significant
in vitro responses to ASP3026, some assays showed
variable sensitivities of the different cell lines to the
effects of ASP3026. Previous reports highlighted inherent
biochemical differences between NPM-ALK+ ALCL
cell lines that could explain their variable sensitivities to
inhibitors of lymphoma cell survival [26].
When the direct effects of ASP3026 on NPM-ALK
were examined, we found remarkable decreases in NPMALK tyrosine kinase activity and tyrosine phosphorylation
levels at 2 residues, Y646 and Y664. It has been
previously shown that Y664 is functionally relevant as
it is the residue where NPM-ALK binds with survivalpromoting proteins such as phospholipase C-γ and IGFIR [27-29]. Downregulation of the phosphorylated form of
NPM-ALK by ASP3026 was associated with a remarkable
reduction in the phosphorylation levels of IGF-IR, STAT3,
AKT, and JNK proteins, which are established targets of
NPM-ALK signaling that contribute significantly to the
survival of this lymphoma [28-33]. At the biochemical
level, ASP3026 successfully induced cleavage of caspase
3 and PARP, further indicating that it induces apoptosis in
NPM-ALK+ ALCL cells.
To analyze the effects of ASP3026 in vivo, we
generated and utilized a systemic NPM-ALK+ ALCL
model in SCID mice and monitored tumor development
using a bioluminescence-based imaging system. Contrary
to the widely utilized NPM-ALK+ ALCL xenograft models
that exploit localized, subcutaneous tumor engrafts [34,
35], our approach is much more relevant to clinical
settings where NPM-ALK+ ALCL patients typically
present with widely disseminated disease. Uninterrupted
oral administration of ASP3026 was associated with total
eradication of established systemic lymphoma tumors with
no evidence of relapse throughout the entire period of the
study. In mice where ASP3026 was withheld after 2 weeks
of daily administration, NPM-ALK+ ALCL tumors quickly
relapsed, indicating that tumor suppression was secondary
to the administration of ASP3026. Nonetheless, when
treatment was resumed in some of these mice, lymphoma
growth decreased significantly and the mice survived until
study termination. In contrast to ASP3026-treated mice,
mice treated with vehicle developed aggressive systemic
lymphoma and had to be euthanized before study period
ended. Importantly, we also evaluated the response of
NPM-ALK+ ALCL to the commonly utilized CHOP
regimen. Although the lymphoma initially regressed in
response to CHOP, it eventually relapsed and mice had to

be euthanized before study termination.
Histologic evaluation of NPM-ALK+ ALCL tumors
in mice undergoing treatment with ASP3026 showed
response to therapy in the form of much less proliferative
lymphoma cells than those observed in control mice.
Furthermore, immunohistochemical staining demonstrated
that pSTAT3 and pIGF-IR expressions were significantly
weakened in tumors collected after ASP3026 treatment,
which supports the Western blotting data from the in vitro
experiments.
NPM-ALK+ ALCL is an aggressive neoplasm.
Although patients show a favorable response to CHOP,
30-40% of patients subsequently develop resistance, have
multiple relapses, and frequently die. Factors that have
been associated with poor outcome include stage III/IV
disease at presentation, involvement of the mediastinum,
viscera or skin, and elevated LDH levels [7, 12]. More
recent studies have shown that the presence of specific
molecular events at presentation or during therapy could
distinguish subgroups of NPM-ALK+ ALCL patients
with worse prognosis. For instance, detection of NPMALK transcripts in bone marrow or serum (i.e., minimal
disseminated disease [MDD]) and levels of anti-NPMALK antibody in serum at diagnosis were used to stratify
128 patients into high-, intermediate- or low-risk groups.
High- and intermediate-risk patients represented 20% and
31%, respectively, of this patient cohort. The progressionfree survival rates were 28% and 68% in these 2 groups,
respectively [36]. Furthermore, patients with MDD at
diagnosis and minimal residual disease after their first
course of CHOP-based chemotherapy showed an 81%
cumulative incidence of relapse and only had a 65% 5-year
overall survival rate [37]. These findings stress the urgent
need to develop more specific and effective approaches to
treat NPM-ALK+ ALCL.
Considering that the number of currently available
ALK inhibitors is limited [38, 39], it is very important to
study these inhibitors in different types of ALK+ tumors
to determine their utility in clinical settings. Crizotinib
is one of the most extensively studied ALK inhibitors;
nonetheless, it has been more evaluated in ALK+ solid
tumors [16-18]. Although crizotinib demonstrated
excellent efficacy in eradicating EML4-ALK+ NSCLC
tumors, recent reports have stressed the evolution of
EML4-ALK mutations that are substantially resistant to
crizotinib [21-23]. Indeed, several mechanisms, including
somatic kinase domain mutations, ALK gene fusion copy
number gain, and the emergence of separate oncogenic
drivers, have been implicated in the initiation of crizotinib
resistance [21-23, 40-43]. Resistance to crizotinib
has also been reported in patients with inflammatory
myofibroblastic tumor who presented with the BARBP2ALK translocation and developed the ALKF1174L activation
mutation after treatment with crizotinib [44]. Notably,
this mutation also resides in a subgroup of neuroblastoma
patients, where it confers resistance to crizotinib [45].

More recently, resistance to crizotinib has also been
described in NPM-ALK+ ALCL [46, 47]. Culturing NPMALK+ ALCL cell lines in increasing concentrations of
crizotinib resulted in the evolution of 2 acquired mutants –
NPM-ALKI231N and NPM-ALKL256Q– that were remarkably
resistant to crizotinib [46]. Furthermore, the NPMALKI231N mutant was also identified in a lymphoma patient
who was receiving crizotinib [47]. Our data show that
ASP3026 effectively decreased the proliferation of 293T
cells expressing these mutants. In addition, ASP3026 was
capable of decreasing the phosphorylation of crizotinibresistant NPM-ALK mutants at Y664. Considering
that therapeutic resistance is a major hurdle for clinical
utilization of crizotinib, these promising findings suggest
that ASP3026 could be used to overcome crizotinib
resistance in NPM-ALK+ ALCL.
In summary, we performed extensive in vitro and
in vivo analyses of the effects of ASP3026 on the survival
and growth of NPM-ALK+ ALCL. Our results provide
strong evidence that ASP3026 could represent a novel
and successful therapeutic strategy to eradicate this
aggressive lymphoma and that patients with NPM-ALK+
ALCL, including those with crizotinib resistance, should
be enrolled in the current clinical trials testing the effects
of ASP3026 in ALK+ neoplasms.

MTS assay
Cell viability was measured using MTS
reagent
(3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2Htetrazolium; Promega, Madison, WI). Briefly, 1 × 105
cells were seeded into 96-well plates, and 20 µL of
MTS reagent was added to each well and incubated for
approximately 2 h at 37°C in 5% CO2. Plates were read
at 490 nm.

METHODS

In vitro apoptosis detection

Cell lines

Cytospin preparations were stained by WrightGiemsa and analyzed by light microscopy for morphologic
features consistent with apoptosis. Apoptosis was also
detected using a commercially available kit (556547,
BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA). Cells were stained with
annexin V-FITC and propidium iodide (PI) and incubated
at room temperature for 15 min in annexin binding buffer.
Analysis was performed using flow cytometry (BD
FACSCalibur) and CellQuest software (BD Biosciences).

The NPM-ALK+ T-cell ALCL cell lines Karpas 299,
SU-DHL-1, SUP-M2, SR-786, and DEL were purchased
from DSMZ (Braunschweig, Germany). The 293T
cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were used in transfection
experiments. Human peripheral blood CD3+ pan-T
lymphocytes were used in some experiments (catalogue
number: PB009-1F) (StemCell Technologies, Vancouver,
BC, Canada). The lymphoma cell lines and T lymphocytes
were maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10%
FBS, 2 mM glutamine, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100
μg/mL streptomycin, and then incubated at 37°C in 5%
CO2. 293T cells were maintained in DMEM under similar
conditions.

BrdU assay
Cell proliferation was measured using a standard kit
(X1327K1, Exalpha Biologicals, Shirley, MD). Cells were
plated at a concentration of 2 × 105 cells/well after which
20 µL of BrdU (1:500 in cell culture medium) was added
for 24 h. Plates were centrifuged for 5 min, fixed, and
washed. Then, 100 µL of anti-BrdU antibody was added
for 1 h, followed by 100 µL of peroxidase goat anti-mouse
IgG conjugate (1:2000) for 30 min and then 100 µL of
3,3´,5,5´-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) substrate for 30
min. Stop solution (50 µL) was added, and the plates were
read at 450/595 nm using an ELISA plate reader.

ALK inhibitor
ASP3026 (CT-ASP302; ChemieTek, Indianapolis,
IN) was suspended in DMSO admixed with H2O and HCl
(1:1) for in vitro experiments and in 0.5% methylcellulose
for in vivo experiments.

Anchorage-independent colony formation

Site-directed mutagenesis

Cells were treated with vehicle or ASP3026 for
48 h and then plated in methylcellulose-based medium
(Methocult H4230; Stemcell Technologies) mixed in
RPMI 1640 (1:5). Harvested cells were suspended in
methylcellulose (v/v; 1:10) and poured into 24-well plates.
The plates were incubated for 5 days at 37°C in 5% CO2.
Colonies were stained using p-iodonitrotetrazolium violet
and visualized using the FluorChem 8800 imaging system
(Alpha Innotech, San Leandro, CA).

To generate the crizotinib-resistant NPM-ALKI231N
and NPM-ALKL256Q mutants that are equivalent to
ALKI1171N and ALKL1196Q, a wild type NPM-ALK plasmid
and the Quick Change II XL Site Directed Mutagenesis
kit were used (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA)
[28, 46, 47]. Primer sequences are depicted in Table 1.
Five-µL of the PCR products were transformed using
MaxEfficiency DH5α competent cells (Invitrogen), and
the transformation reactions were plated in ampicillin
resistant plates overnight at 37°C. Colonies containing
the correct inserts, as determined by sequencing, were
amplified overnight at 37°C in LB Broth containing
ampicillin, and subjected to purification by using the
Qiaprep Spin Miniprep Kit (Qiagen). Optical densities
were acquired using spectrophotometry (NanoDrop 2000,
Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA).

Tyrosine kinase assay
NPM-ALK tyrosine kinase activity was measured
using the Universal Tyrosine Kinase Assay Kit
(Takara Bio, Pittsburg, PA). Briefly, 2 × 106 cells were
immunoprecipitated using standard protocol and ALK
antibody (Dako) overnight at 4°C. Samples were spun
and resuspended (including beads) in Kinase Reacting
Solution and plated in triplicates in the protein tyrosine
kinase substrate immobilized microplate (provided in
the kit). ATP-2Na was added to each well in order to
start tyrosine phosphorylation and incubated at 37°C
for 30 min. The sample solution was then aspirated, and
the wells were washed 4 times. Subsequently, samples
were blocked with blocking solution for 30 min at 37°C,
followed by addition of 50 μL of anti-phosphotyrosine
(PY20)-horseradish peroxidase (HRP) solution for 30
min at 37°C. Finally, samples were washed and 100 μL of
the HRP substrate TMB was added into each well for 15
min. The reaction was stopped by adding 100 µL of stop
solution and absorbance was measured at 450 nm.

Transfection
Briefly, 293T cells (1 × 106) were plated in 6 well
plates 24 h prior to transfection. Then, 2 µg of wild type
NPM-ALK, NPM-ALKI231N or NPM-ALKL256Q were
added to 100 µL OptiMEM medium. Simultaneously, 7
µL of Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) were added to 100 µL
OptiMEM medium in a different tube. After incubation
for 5 min at room temperature, the contents of the 2
tubes were admixed and incubated for 20 min at room
temperature. The mixture was added to the corresponding
well.

Systemic xenograft NPM-ALK+ ALCL model

Western blotting

In vivo studies were preapproved by our Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee. Karpas 299 cells
permanently expressing firefly luciferase and green
fluorescence protein (GFP) were generated by using the
F-Luc-GFP lentivirus (Capital Biosciences, Rockville,
MD) in which humanized firefly luciferase (hLUC) was
expressed under the CMV promoter. GFP and puromycin
resistance marker were co-expressed bicistronically
under the SV40 promoter [48]. Cells (1x106/mouse) were
injected into the tail veins of female C.B-17 SCID mice
(6-8 weeks old; Taconic, Cambridge City, IN). Most of
the mice developed NPM-ALK+ ALCL at approximately
3 weeks after injection. Lymphoma was monitored
by luciferase signaling detection upon intraperitoneal

The lysis buffer contained 25 mM HEPES (pH 7.7),
400 mM NaCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 2 mM EDTA, 0.5% Triton
X-100, 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 3 mM
dithiothreitol, phosphatase and protease inhibitor cocktails.
Fifty to 80 μg total proteins were electrophoresed on 8%
SDS-PAGE, transferred onto polyvinylidene fluoride
membranes, and probed with primary antibodies and
then matched secondary antibodies conjugated with HRP.
Protein expression was detected using chemiluminescence
and a commercially available kit (GE Healthcare,
Piscataway, NJ).

ASP3026 (30 mg/kg daily) was administered using oral
gavage at 3 weeks after injection of Karpas 299 cells. In
one group (U), ASP3026 was administered uninterruptedly
for 10 weeks, and in a second group (I), it was given for
2 weeks, interrupted for 4 weeks, and then continued
for an additional 4 weeks. Control mice were given
vehicle (0.5% methylcellulose). In a fourth group, CHOP
[cyclophosphamide (40 mg/kg), doxorubicin (3.3 mg/kg),
and vincristine (0.5 mg/kg) were given intravenously; and
prednisone (0.2 mg/kg) was given by oral gavage] was
administered for 5 consecutive days 3 weeks after injection
of the lymphoma cell line [49, 50]. Tumor progression was
monitored every week until death or until the study was
concluded at week 13. The mice were euthanized and a
total body necropsy was performed. Tumors were excised
and fixed in 10% buffered formalin or snap-frozen in
liquid nitrogen.

of Kaplan-Meier curves. The significance of differences
between the groups was assessed using the Mantel-Cox
log-rank test. For other data, statistical significance was
detected by using one-way analysis of variance and the
Bonferroni’s post hoc multiple comparisons test. P < 0.05
was considered statistically significant.

Apoptosis detection in mice was performed
by intraperitoneal injection of the firefly luciferase
prosubstrate VivoGlo Caspase-3/7 (P1781; Z-DEVDAminoluciferin, Promega) and bioluminescence imaging
(IVIS Lumina XR imaging system; Caliper Life Sciences).

Immunohistochemical staining
Formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissue
sections from mouse lymphoma tumors were
deparaffinized using an alcohol gradient. Sections were
subsequently washed and subjected to antigen retrieval
for 20 min in a steamer using 1× Target Retrieval Solution
(Dako) and then allowed to cool down for 20 min to
room temperature, washed, and incubated in 3% H2O2
for 15 min to block endogenous peroxidase activity.
The sections were then blocked in serum-free blocking
solution (Universal LSAB+ kit, Dako) for 30 min at room
temperature. Primary antibody diluted in blocking buffer
(1:50 for ALK and pSTAT3; 1:100 for pIGF-IR and Ki67) was added for overnight incubation at 4°C. Next,
the sections were washed 3 times and incubated with
the secondary antibody LINK and then with secondary
antibody streptavidin each for 30 min, and developed with
3,3´-diaminodbenzidine tetrahydrochloride substrate that
includes HRP. Hematoxylin was used for counterstaining.
