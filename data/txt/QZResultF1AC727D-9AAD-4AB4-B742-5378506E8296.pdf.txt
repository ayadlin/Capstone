BACKGROUND: Studies of mechanisms mediating resistance to chemotherapy led to the discovery of the multidrug transporter
ABCB1 (ATP-binding cassette, subfamily B, member 1), often expressed in leukemic cells of patients with acute myeloid leukemia
(AML). Most clinical trials evaluating the strategy of inhibiting efflux-mediated chemotherapeutic resistance have been unsuccessful,
clearly indicating the need for a better approach. METHODS: This study investigated the clinical relevance of 380 genes whose
expression has been shown to affect the response to chemotherapy, mostly through in vitro studies, in 11 paired samples obtained at
AML diagnosis and at relapse. The expression profiling of these 380 genes was performed using TaqMan-based quantitative reversetranscription polymerase chain reaction. Patients had a median age of 58 years at diagnosis, a median duration of complete remission
of 284.5 days, and a median overall survival of 563 days. Cytogenetic abnormalities were detected at diagnosis in 4 patients, whereas
5 displayed a normal karyotype and 2 were not investigated. RESULTS: Hierarchical clustering shows that samples taken at diagnosis
and relapse clustered in pairs for 6 patients of the 11 studied, suggesting recurrence of the same leukemic blast, whereas for the other
5 patients, the data indicate their relapse blasts arose from different origins. A patient-by-patient analysis of the paired samples led
to the striking observation that each had a unique gene signature representing different mechanisms of resistance. CONCLUSIONS:
The data underline the need for personalized molecular analysis to tailor treatment for patients with AML. Cancer 2013;119:3076-83.

INTRODUCTION
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a heterogeneous disease characterized by clonal proliferation of malignant precursors of
a myeloid lineage with impaired differentiation of normal hematopoietic progenitors.1 Although the majority of patients
with AML achieve remission, most eventually relapse, ultimately succumbing to the disease. Recent studies revealed the
clonal architecture of secondary AML, which is a dynamic process shaped by multiple cycles of mutation acquisition and
clonal selection.2 However, the underlying alterations in gene transcription that allow relapse after chemotherapy remain
poorly understood.
ABCB1 (ATP-binding cassette, subfamily B, member 1; also known as multidrug resistance 1/P-glycoprotein)
exports a wide variety of drugs that are mechanistically and structurally unrelated,3 and is often found to be highly
expressed in leukemic blasts.4-6 Although inhibition of ABCB1 to increase chemosensitivity has been successful in vitro,
translating this strategy to clinical settings has failed.7,8 Indeed, trials evaluating ABCB1 inhibitors in more than 2000
patients with AML have failed to yield positive results.9 Since the discovery of ABCB1 and the emergence of the genomic
era, numerous genes have been revealed to mediate drug resistance.10 Yet the benefits of this research for patients who develop resistance to chemotherapy are minimal.
The current analytical methods for high-throughput gene expression profiling are based on mean values to find differentially expressed genes, with the goal of identifying a common gene signature that defines a trend among patients.

However, such a strategy is clearly insufficient, because
the variability among patients is totally ignored. For such
an analysis to identify rare signatures in individuals that
are associated with drug resistance in which the prediction
is based on a Boolean rule, the analysis of several hundred
samples would be needed to avoid overfitting problems.
Nevertheless, in a heterogeneous disease such as AML,
one effective way to identify rare resistance mechanisms is
to do a patient-by-patient analysis of paired samples taken
at diagnosis and after relapse, thereby minimizing false
hits due to interpersonal variability.11
We conducted a unique study using paired samples
to discern the mechanisms involved in the acquisition of
multidrug resistance (MDR) in patients with AML, using
highly sensitive and specific TaqMan-based quantitative
reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRTPCR).12 The 380 genes involved in phase I and II metabolism, signal transduction, DNA repair, stress response,
tumor suppressor activity, oncogenic transformation, apoptosis, and drug uptake or efflux were chosen on the basis of their potential role in MDR, as indicated by reports
published over the past 3 decades.13 Here, we extend to
the transcriptional level the recent genetic discoveries in
AML showing great heterogeneity of the tumor,2 because
the data demonstrate that the mechanisms of resistance
are highly heterogeneous.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Samples

The collection of tumors for research and specific molecular
analysis was first approved by the ethical review board of the
Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden (ethical permit
number: KI Dnr 03-600) and written, informed consent
was obtained from the patients. Peripheral blood was then
collected from 11 patients with AML at diagnosis and at
relapse after treatment, and separated with Ficoll-Paque
(GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Blasts were cryopreserved at the biobank
at the Department of Hematology, Karolinska University
Hospital. Pathological analysis at the Karolinska Institutet
confirmed that each sample contained at least 80% leukemic blasts. Patients had undergone treatment with cytarabine combined with daunorubicin, idarubicin, etoposide,
mitoxantrone, and/or thioguanine. Data on clinical outcomes were obtained from patient records. Duration of
complete remission (CR) was the number of days between
CR (determined by bone marrow aspirates that showed less
than 5% blasts) and first documented relapse in blood or
bone marrow. Patients had a median age of 58 years at diagnosis, ranging from age 28 to 72 years. The median duration of CR was 284.5 days, with a range of 48 to 1166 days
and the median overall survival was 563 days, ranging from
a low of 193 to a high of 1664 days (Table 1).14 Cytogenetic

aberrations were found in 4 patients at the time of diagnosis,
5 displayed a normal karyotype, whereas 2 were not investigated. Regarding mutations of individual genes, eg, FLT3
or NPM1, no such assessments were made at diagnosis,
because the collection of samples took place from 1987 to
2001.
Preparation of Total RNA

Total RNA was prepared using the Trizol method (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif). RNA was quantified using a
NanoDrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer (NanoDrop
Technologies, Wilmington, Del). The integrity of the
RNA samples was assessed using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Foster City, Calif) and then
stored at 280 C. RNA integrity number > 7 for each
RNA sample analyzed.
Reverse Transcription

Synthesis of complementary DNA (cDNA) from 1 lg
total RNA in a 20 lL reaction volume was carried out
using the High Capacity cDNA kit with ribonuclease inhibitor (Applied Biosystems) as per the manufacturer’s
instructions. The reverse-transcription conditions were as
follows: 10 minutes at 25 C, 120 minutes at 37 C, 5
minutes at 85 C. Following reverse transcription, cDNA
was stored at 4 C.
TaqMan Low Density Arrays (TLDAs)

Expression levels of 380 MDR-associated genes were
measured using custom-made TaqMan Low Density
Arrays in addition to the 18S ribosomal RNA being
arrayed in 4 replicates (Applied Biosystems).13,15 The
cDNA was mixed with 23 TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems), loaded on a TaqMan LowDensity Array (TLDA) card, and run on an ABI-Prism
7900 HT Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems) as per the manufacturer’s instructions.
Data Analysis

Data from the TLDA cards was collected for each of the
11 paired AML samples (available from the GEO Database, accession number: GSE33787). The normalization
of the data was performed in subtracting the median
expression of each sample from all gene expression data
for that sample. The expressions from replicate probes
were averaged together. This analysis was carried out using
BRB ArrayTools, a microarray-data statistical analysis tool
(http://linus.nci.nih.gov/BRB-ArrayTools.html).16
In
order to remove genes that are not likely to be informative, those expressed by fewer than 50% of the samples
were filtered out, resulting in analysis of 331 genes. Hier3078

archical clustering was done on the normalized, filtered
data, using an average linkage algorithm with 1-Pearson
correlation as the distance. A Spearman rank test was used
to assess the correlation between French-American-British
(FAB) classification and the expression of each gene
(threshold: Spearman rank P < .05). The Cox proportional hazards test was used to study the correlation of
gene expression with the duration of CR. The false discovery rate (FDR) for each gene was calculated using the Benjamini-Hochberg method for both methods. Pairwise
comparisons were manually performed using the DDCt
method.17
RESULTS
Comparison of MDR-Linked Gene Expression
Profiles of Paired AML Samples Taken at
Diagnosis and After Relapse

Unsupervised hierarchical clustering was performed on all
paired samples (Fig. 1). For 6 of 11 patients, the pair of
samples (at diagnosis and after relapse) clustered together,
indicating that the development of resistance did not
involve a major change in pattern of gene expression. This
also supports that at least for this set of patients, diagnosis
and relapse leukemias had similar origins. For the other 5
pairs of samples that clustered apart, for which large
changes in the gene expression profile were observed
between the paired samples, no distinguishing trend could
be found for age, the subtype (based on the cell type from
which the leukemia developed and its degree of maturation, ie, FAB classification18), the CR duration, the treatment, or the overall survival time (Table 1).
Genes that significantly differ in expression between
diagnosis and relapse blast samples from the same patient
may give insight into what contributes to relapse and why
relapsed AML may be more resistant to treatment. Supervised comparison of samples taken at diagnosis and after
relapse, paired according to the patient, revealed 27 genes
that are differentially expressed, in most cases only to a
small extent, between these 2 groups (P < .05; Table 2).
None of these genes fulfilled the stringent criteria of
FDR < 0.05, but this may be due to the low number of
samples analyzed.

False discovery rate (FDR) is measured using the Benjamini-Hochberg
method and is an estimate of the proportion of the genes with P <.05 that
represent false positives. For example, there is a 50.8% chance that MSH3
is a false positive. One can consider that genes with a FDR > 15% are not
statistically significant.

passed the filtering criteria (see “Data Analysis” section
above) were found to correlate with FAB classification for
samples taken at diagnosis (P < .05). Among these genes,
2 genes, encoding the antiapoptotic bcl2-related protein
A1 (BCL2A1) and glutathione reductase (GSR), fulfilled
a FDR < 15% and were found to be positively correlated,

along with FAB (from 0 to 5) (Fig. 2, Table 3). More precisely, the probability of finding these genes by chance at
P < .05 is 7.1% and 14.3%, respectively. Four additional
genes fulfilled a FDR < 15% and were negatively correlated with FAB classes, and were therefore upregulated in
immature cells compared with differentiated cells. These
genes were POLH, NOLA2, ABCD4, and MNAT1 (Table 3). Fifteen genes were found to be correlated with FAB
at P < .05 for samples taken at relapse; however, none of
these genes fulfilled a FDR < 15% (data not shown).
Gene Correlation With Duration of CR Does Not
Highlight Any Trend Among Patients

Genes that correlate with the duration of the first and second CRs may be important predictors of relapse. This
would hold true unless a small population of cells present
at diagnosis is responsible for relapse or there is a fundamental change in the biology of AML between diagnosis

otherapy, we hypothesized that each patient may have a
unique set of genes within his or her AML blasts that contribute to the observed MDR, which would have been
missed by statistical analysis highlighting trends of gene
patterns observed “on average” across samples.20 This
issue was addressed by performing a patient-by-patient

Fold-change of 9 ABC transporters known to be involved in chemotherapy resistance, in samples taken after relapse compared with their counterparts taken
at diagnosis.
Abbreviations: NA, not applicable (no detection of the measured genes); P, patient.

ABCB1, which has been evaluated in patients with
AML as a potential target for pharmacologic downregulation of efflux-mediated chemotherapy resistance, was
found to be overexpressed in the leukemic cells of 5
patients of the 11 (Fig. 3). A similar observation was made
for ABCG2, although that transporter may actually be
associated with the intrinsic biology of the leukemia rather
than with drug efflux mediating resistance per se (Fig. 3).
Figure 3. ABC transporter-mediated multidrug resistance.
Histogram presenting the expression levels of ABCB1 and
ABCG2, two ABC transporters intensively studied in patients
with AML, in relapse samples compared with their paired
samples taken at diagnosis. No bar appears when the measured gene is not expressed.

which led to the striking observation that when each of
these patients relapsed, their AML cells expressed genes
representing different potential mechanisms of resistance.
Table 5 shows the expression profile of 9 ABC transporters that have been shown to mediate MDR (data extracted
from Table 4). Although no trend was revealed based on
FAB classification, as mentioned above, it is observed that
the leukemic cells of all patients except patient 1 (FAB:
M4) showed increase at relapse of at least one ABC transporter capable of transporting either anthracyclines,
vinca-alkaloids, or both. The analysis of samples taken
from patient 9 (FAB: M5b) reveals that 4 ABC transporters—ABCB1 (MDR1/P-gp), ABCC1 (MRP1), ABCC5
(MRP5), and ABCG2 (BCRP)—are overexpressed in leukemic cells. This indicates that conventional chemotherapy (anthracyclines/vinca-alkaloids) is not likely to benefit
this patient and will probably only have a negative effect
by causing deterioration of the patient’s condition
through the side effects of these compounds.

DISCUSSION
Genome-wide analyses have revealed the molecular
genetic heterogeneity of AML.21-23 A number of reports
have established that AML cases can be classified into various groups based on their chromosomal abnormalities, somatic acquired mutations, gene and microRNA
expression profiles, and methylation status.24 However,
our understanding of the mechanisms causing the relapse
of patients is limited. Although most patients with AML
achieve CR, a large fraction of them will relapse and have
a dismal prognosis, demonstrating the dire need to specifically address the reason for relapse. Pairs of samples taken
at diagnosis and after relapse, combined with a reliable
gene expression profiling assay, are prerequisites to understanding mechanisms mediating MDR.
In this study based on paired samples obtained at
AML diagnosis and at relapse, for the first time, we
assessed 380 MDR-related genes, through use of TaqMan-based qRT-PCR, which is a state-of-the-art gene
expression profiling assay. An unsupervised hierarchical
clustering revealed that samples taken at diagnosis and
relapse clustered in pairs for 6 patients of the 11 studied,
indicating return of the same leukemic blast, whereas the
other 5 relapses had different transcription patterns and
may have originated from different blasts. None of the
gene signatures found to be correlated with either relapse
or duration of remission were statistically significant. The

observed enormous heterogeneity in gene expression
across study patients remained true when we examined
AML by subtype (M1, M4, and M5 subtypes are represented by 3 samples each; Table 4).
This investigation extends to the transcriptional level
the recent findings highlighting the dynamic clonal evolution during AML relapse.2 Importantly, these data also
demonstrate that systemic chemotherapy has a substantial
effect on the increased number of new mutations. Identifying new targets whose expression is altered after chemotherapy is critical to limit the occurrence of relapse.
However, a personalized approach presents multiple challenges, such as pinpointing the clinically relevant targets
from among numerous candidates in each individual gene
signature, and eventually designing multiply-targeted
treatment regimens to limit the survival of tumor cells
through alternative drug resistance pathways. Although
by definition the individual changes we see in this study
are not “statistically significant,” each patient acts as his or
her own control. By evaluating only genes known to be capable of conferring resistance to drugs such as those used
to treat AML, we can generate a specific hypothesis for
each patient about how best to treat their relapsed AML.
These hypotheses could be tested in short-term ex vivo
cultures of their cells, using drugs known not to be subject
to resistance mechanisms expressed in their AML cells, or
by using inhibitors of demonstrated resistance
mechanisms.
