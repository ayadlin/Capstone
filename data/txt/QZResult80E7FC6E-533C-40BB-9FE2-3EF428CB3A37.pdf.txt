Summary

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Aberrant fusions between heterologous chromosomes are among the most prevalent cytogenetic
abnormalities found in cancer cells. Oncogenic chromosomal translocations provide cells with a
proliferative or survival advantage. They may either initiate transformation or be acquired
secondarily as a result of genomic instability. Here we highlight recent advances toward
understanding the origin of chromosomal translocations in incipient lymphoid cancers and how
tumor-suppressive pathways normally limit the frequency of these aberrant recombination events.
Deciphering the mechanisms that mediate chromosomal fusions will open new avenues for
developing therapeutic strategies aimed at eliminating lesions that lead to the initiation, maintenance,
and progression of cancer.

Introduction

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Chromosomal translocations are the most common class of mutations found in hematological
malignancies (Kuppers, 2005). In addition, recurrent chromosomal fusions have been causally
implicated in sarcomas and other solid tumors (Kumar-Sinha et al., 2008). There are a few
common mechanisms by which translocations provide a proliferative or survival advantage to
an incipient cancer cell. First, when cis-regulatory transcriptional elements from one gene are
apposed to a proto-oncogene, this causes aberrant expression of the growth-promoting
oncogene. For example, Burkitt's lymphoma carries a reciprocal translocation that results in
fusion of the coding region of the c-myc proto-oncogene with the immunoglobulin heavy chain
(IgH) (Jankovic et al., 2007), which places c-myc under the control of the 3′ regulatory elements
of IgH (Gostissa et al., 2009). c-myc is thereby deregulated and promotes cellular
transformation through its effects on the cell cycle, differentiation, and apoptosis. A second
mechanism by which translocations may promote transformation involves the fusion of two
genes to produce a chimeric protein with oncogenic activity. A prototypical example is the
Philadelphia chromosome found in a subtype of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ ALL) and
chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), in which the BCR-ABL fusion gene encodes a protein with
deregulated kinase activity. BCR-ABL expression results in cytokine-independent growth,
resistance to apoptosis, and genetic instability (Kuppers, 2005). In addition to protein encoding
genes, chromosomal translocations can also involve microRNA genes (Calin et al., 2004).

various cancers and may play a causal role in tumorigenesis (Calin and Croce, 2007; Robbiani
et al., 2009).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Translocation requires: 1) formation of paired double strand DNA breaks (DSBs) on separate
chromosomes 2) proximity of broken ends (at least transiently) and 3) joining of the
heterologous DNA ends, as opposed to fusion in cis (Figure 1). Although many different
cancers carry recurrent chromosome translocations (see
http://www.sanger.ac.uk/genetics/CGP/Census/translocation.shtml), this review will focus on
the etiology of translocations in lymphocytes as these are the most well-characterized to date.
We expect that most incipient cancer cells will share the basic mechanisms involved in the
development of and protection against chromosomal translocations.

Chromosomal translocations in context
Approximately 95% of all lymphomas are of B cell origin (Kuppers, 2005). These cancers are
heterogeneous, involving all B cell developmental stages: from early B cells in acute
lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) to mature B cells in Burkitt's lymphoma and plasma cells in
multiple myeloma. Despite their disparate origins, many of these cancers carry balanced
chromosomal translocations that involve immunoglobulin (Ig) genes and oncogenic partner
genes (Figure 1); in rarer cases, translocations can be non-reciprocal or join two non-Ig genes
(Kuppers, 2005).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Why are B cells particularly susceptible to transformation by chromosome translocation? This
issue has been the subject of much debate, beginning immediately after these abnormal
cytological features were discovered. A great deal of the discussion has focused on antigen
receptor gene diversification during V(D)J recombination, somatic hypermutation (SHM) and
class switch recombination (CSR), as all three require programmed DNA damage (Figure 2).
The notion that antibody gene diversification reactions initiate translocations was strongly
bolstered when the first lymphoid cancer associated translocation was characterized as a fusion
between c-myc and the switch region of the IgH locus suggesting that c-myc/IgH translocations
arise as a byproduct of aberrant Ig class switching (Jankovic et al., 2007). In the ensuing years,
many additional translocations have been documented in lymphoid cancers, and in most,
though not all cases, at least one of the partner chromosomes was an Ig variable or switch
region. Translocations involving two non-Ig genes are interesting exceptions to the rule;
however, this group of translocations may also be products of “off target” genome
destabilization by the Ig V(D)J recombinase, recombinase activating gene 1/2 (RAG1/2) and/
or activation induced cytidine deaminase (AID) (Robbiani et al., 2009;Tsai et al., 2008) (see
below).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Although less is known about translocations in other cell types, they appear to be frequent
events in solid tumors, especially in sarcomas and prostate cancer (Lin et al., 2009; Mitelman
et al., 2007; Tomlins et al., 2007). Recently published work suggests that in prostate cells interchromosomal interactions and translocations are induced by transcription factors and possibly
by aberrant expression of AID (Lin et al., 2009). Androgen receptors are thought to juxtapose
translocating loci and recruit enzymatic activities such as AID or ORF2 endonuclease that
produce DSBs (Lin et al., 2009).

DSBs Associated with Antigen Receptor Diversification
V(D)J recombination
V(D)J recombination is a site-specific DNA remodeling reaction required for the assembly of
antigen receptor genes in developing B and T lymphocytes (Figure 2). This reaction is mediated
by the RAG1/2 recombinase, which nicks DNA at recombination signal sequences and

catalyzes a trans-esterification reaction leading to the formation of paired hairpin (coding end)
and blunt (signal end) DNA ends. These breaks can trigger the DNA damage response (Chen
et al., 2000) and are resolved by the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) DNA repair
machinery, whose components include the Ku70/Ku80 heterodimer, DNA-dependent protein
kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs), Artemis, XLF/Cernunnos, XRCC4, and DNA Ligase
IV (Lig4)(de Villartay, 2009;Sleckman, 2005)(Figure 3)[RK1]. To date, Artemis and DNAPKcs have been implicated in hairpin opening and are not required for the resolution of signal
ends, whereas the other NHEJ components are essential for joining both coding and signal
ends.
RAG1/2 can also function as a transposase in vitro (Jones and Gellert, 2004; Schatz and
Spanopoulou, 2005). The transposase activity has been proposed as a means by which this
enzyme can produce translocations; however, extensive sequence analysis indicates that this
event is unlikely to occur frequently. Instead, the V(D)J associated translocations appear to be
the result of aberrant joining of unresolved coding ends as indicated by their proximity to
translocation junctions in t(11;14) bcl-1/IgH translocations in mantle cell lymphoma, t(14;18)
bcl-2/IgH translocations in follicular lymphoma and in primary mouse T cells (Curry et al.,
2007; Kuppers, 2005).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

In addition to creating breaks in genes that contain recombination signal sequences, RAG1/2
is thought to be able to produce breaks in oncogenes, such as bcl-2, that contain non-B-DNA
or methyl-CpGs (Raghavan et al., 2004; Tsai et al., 2008). Although there is as yet no direct
evidence that RAG1/2 can cleave these genes in B-lymphocytes, cleavage activity on non-BDNA lacking a recombination signal sequence (RSS) has been detected in transfected cell lines
using purified substrates in vitro (Raghavan et al., 2004). In addition, the RAG1/2 recombinase
is also capable of acting as a nuclease and nicking mismatches and processing nicks, gaps, and
flaps into DSBs (Santagata et al., 1999). Thus, RAG1/2 creates DSBs in Ig genes and has the
ability to produce lesions in other genes as well.
RAG induced translocations and cancer in mice

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Direct evidence that RAG1/2 activity mediates chromosome translocations in vivo comes from
analyses of mice deficient in NHEJ proteins (Jankovic et al., 2007). NHEJ deficient mice are
unable to complete V(D)J recombination and therefore developing lymphocytes in these mice
carry unresolved DNA breaks. However, developing NHEJ deficient lymphocytes do not
usually harbor translocations, and mutant mice do not rapidly develop cancer. This is thought
to be due to the fact that unresolved V(D)J breaks normally trigger p53 dependent apoptosis
(Guidos et al., 1996). Consistent with this notion, mice deficient in both NHEJ and p53
invariably develop progenitor B cell lymphoma at an early age; in the majority of cases these
tumors harbor clonal non-reciprocal translocations between IgH and c-myc, and both genes are
commonly amplified. Importantly, these DNA rearrangements require RAG1/2-induced DNA
cleavage (Difilippantonio et al., 2002; Zhu et al., 2002). The majority of breakpoints in the
IgH locus are near the JH cluster, which further supports the role of failed V(D)J recombination
in translocation. The breakpoints on Chr15 are localized 70-700 kb from the 3′ end of c-myc
(Difilippantonio et al., 2002; Zhu et al., 2002). This is distinct from what occurs in human
Burkitt's lymphoma, where translocations between IgH and c-myc are usually reciprocal
(meaning that there is equal exchange between both broken chromosomes) and IgH sequences
are usually joined to a sequence cluster near exon 1 of c-myc. Thus, although the RAG1/2
endonuclease catalyzes IgH breaks, the mechanism for c-myc breakage in NHEJ-deficient
tumors remains unclear, as are the DNA repair pathways that catalyze these complex oncogenic
fusion and amplification events in the absence of NHEJ. In addition to showing that aberrant
end-joining pathways can lead to translocations, these studies also make it clear that p53
activation protects against RAG-mediated translocations.

Somatic Hypermutation and Class Switching

NIH-PA Author Manuscript
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Somatic hypermutation introduces non-templated nucleotide substitutions into the variable
region of Ig genes in mature B cells that have been stimulated during immune responses (Di
Noia and Neuberger, 2007; Peled et al., 2008) (Figure 2). Antibody variants with higher affinity
for the antigen are selected during the germinal center response leading to an overall increase
in antibody affinity (Meffre et al., 2000). CSR is a region specific deletional recombination
reaction that replaces one antibody constant region for another while maintaining the specificity
of the antibody (Stavnezer et al., 2008) (Figure 2). Switched antibody variants have unique
effector functions, for example IgA is specialized for secretion into milk. Nearly a decade ago,
groups led by Tasuku Honjo and Anne Durandy discovered that activation-induced cytidine
deaminase (AID) is essential for both CSR and SHM in mice and humans (Muramatsu et al.,
2000; Revy et al., 2000) (Figure 2). Shortly thereafter, nuclear foci of γ-H2AX and Nbs1, which
mark sites of DNA damage, were found to accumulate specifically at the IgH locus in an AIDdependent manner (Petersen et al., 2001); this led to the conclusion that AID acts upstream of
DSB formation during CSR, and that the canonical cellular DNA damage response is involved
in the processing of AID-induced DSBs (Petersen et al., 2001). In addition, AID-dependent
damage foci formed in G0/G1, indicating that like RAG1/2 induced DSBs, AID-dependent
DSBs may be restricted to this phase of the cell cycle. These cytological observations were
later confirmed by ligation-mediated polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays (Schrader et al.,
2007), and by studies showing that DNA repair mutants undergoing CSR accumulate IgHspecific chromosome breaks (rather than S-phase generated chromatid breaks) in mitotic
spreads (Franco et al., 2006; Ramiro et al., 2006).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Although these studies did not pinpoint the mechanism by which AID functions during gene
rearrangements or translocation, pioneering work by Michael Neuberger and colleagues
supported a unifying model in which AID promotes both class switching and somatic
hypermutation (Di Noia and Neuberger, 2007; Peled et al., 2008). According to this model,
AID acts by deaminating cytosine residues in single-strand DNA (ssDNA) that is exposed
during transcription. The resulting uracil:guanine mismatches are then recognized by the uracil
DNA glycosylase or the mismatch repair proteins, and processed in an error-prone manner by
DNA repair pathways leading either to mutation or DSBs, which are intermediates in class
switching (Di Noia and Neuberger, 2007; Stavnezer et al., 2008). This model is consistent with
a profound defect in class switching in knockout mice lacking uracil DNA glycosylase and
hyper IgM syndrome in humans deficient for uracil DNA glycosylase (Imai et al., 2003; Rada
et al., 2002). Furthermore, it is in agreement with the defects in SHM and CSR found in
Msh2/6 mutant mice (Di Noia and Neuberger, 2007; Peled et al., 2008; Stavnezer et al.,
2008). Finally, this model is also supported by direct biochemical and genetic experiments,
showing that cytosine residues in ssDNA, which are exposed during transcription, are the
preferred substrate for AID (Di Noia and Neuberger, 2007; Peled et al., 2008; Stavnezer et al.,
2008).

AID mutations in non-Ig genes
Unlike RAG1/2, which is a sequence specific endonuclease, AID can deaminate cytosines in
nearly any sequence context, but has a preference for RGYW motifs (Di Noia and Neuberger,
2007; Peled et al., 2008). This is a key feature of AID since mutations in a diverse collection
of Ig variable regions maximizes the chances of producing somatic variants with higher affinity.
An important question that remains to be answered is how AID finds its target genes and avoids
producing widespread genomic damage.
An important first step in this direction lies in defining the set of genes that can be mutated by
AID. Experiments with human and mouse B cells show that, in addition to Ig, AID can also
mutate a number of oncogenes including c-myc, Pim1, Pax5 and RHOH as well as Bcl6, Igα,

Igβ and fas (Gordon et al., 2003; Muschen et al., 2000; Pasqualucci et al., 1998; Pasqualucci
et al., 2001; Shen et al., 1998). Recently, a broad survey of 118 genes expressed in germinal
center B lymphocytes reveals that as many as 25% are mutated by AID, although most of these
are hit at a frequency that is 100-fold lower than Ig (Liu et al., 2008). Interestingly, mutations
at c-myc, the most frequent translocation partner for IgH in Burkitt's lymphoma, are detected
at close to background levels under physiological conditions (Liu et al., 2008; Pasqualucci et
al., 2001). However, c-myc accumulates AID-mediated mutations in the absence of base
excision and mismatch repair pathways, indicating that some genes that are targeted by AID
may be repaired in an error-free manner by the base excision and mismatch-repair machinery
(Liu et al., 2008). Consistent with this notion and in contrast to IgH, c-myc does not show DSB
repair foci in AID-expressing B cells under physiological conditions (Robbiani et al., 2008).
Although the full extent of genomic damage produced by AID has not yet been defined,
deregulated expression of AID in B cells leads to chromatid breaks and translocations involving
nearly every chromosome (Robbiani et al., 2009). Thus, AID can produce mutations in many
genes other than antibody genes, some of which are rapidly fixed by error-free pathways;
others, that are not repaired, can produce DSBs that destabilize the B cell genome.
Translocations initiated by AID

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Following the discovery that AID mutates Ig variable and switch regions, it became possible
to address the longstanding issue of the origin of DNA breaks in Ig switch regions that lead to
oncogenic chromosomal translocations. Given that lesion formation at the IgH locus is codependent on AID and uracil DNA glycosylase, it could be predicted that these enzymes might
also be required for chromosomal translocations associated with class switching. This
hypothesis is borne out by experiments demonstrating that AID is required for c-myc/IgH
translocations, which are associated with IL-6 induced mouse plasmacytocis (Ramiro et al.,
2004) and pristaine oil injections (Takizawa et al., 2008). Moreover, translocation is dependent
on uracil DNA glycosylase (Ramiro et al., 2006), which indicates that processing of U:G
mismatches generated by AID is required for translocation (Ramiro et al., 2006).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

AID is indirectly implicated in the pathogenesis of human lymphomas because it is expressed
in some forms of lymphoma, including diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), which are
characterized by IgH-associated chromosomal rearrangements (Lenz et al., 2007). Direct
evidence that deregulated AID expression leads to B cell lymphoma has only recently been
obtained (Robbiani et al., 2009). Several groups produced transgenic mice expressing AID,
beginning with Honjo and his colleagues (Okazaki et al., 2003). Some, but not all of these mice
are cancer-prone, developing T lymphomas and epithelial tumors that are associated with
aberrant SHM (Muto et al., 2006; Okazaki et al., 2003; Shen et al., 2008). However, although
AID is almost exclusively expressed in B cells under physiologic circumstances, B cell
lymphomas are not found in AID transgenic mice, even when the transgene is expressed
exclusively in B cells (Muto et al., 2006). In addition, there are no chromosomal translocations
in the tumors that eventually formed in non-B cells (Okazaki et al., 2003). Instead, cancers
caused by the de-regulated expression of AID are characterized by point mutations in
oncogenes, as well as passenger mutations in other non-tumor promoting genes (Okazaki et
al., 2003). This apparent discrepancy between the absence of B cell lymphoma generation in
vivo, and frequent AID-mediated c-myc/IgH translocation in vitro has been resolved by the
discovery that AID deregulation leads to the rapid onset of mature B cell lymphoma when
combined with deletion of p53 (Robbiani et al., 2009). In AID transgenic/p53-deficient mice,
lymphomas almost invariably carry reciprocal clonal chromosome translocations. Some of
these translocations involve c-myc and IgH, reminiscent of Burkitt's lymphoma, whereas others
joined c-myc to the promoter of microRNA-142 (miR-142), a translocation that is also found
in human B cell leukemia (Gauwerky et al., 1989). Translocation between c-myc and

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

miR-142 brings c-myc under the control of the mir-142 promoter and deregulates c-myc
expression (Robbiani et al., 2009). miR-142 is likely to be involved in these cancer-producing
translocations because it too is an AID target gene (Robbiani et al., 2009).
AID-mediated DSBs in non-Ig genes

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Relative to the amount of information we have about AID-mediated DSBs at Ig loci, much less
is known regarding the role of AID in producing DSBs in non-Ig genes. DSBs are detectable
at the IgH as evidenced by the focal accumulation of proteins that mark sites of DSBs (Petersen
et al., 2001) (Figure 4, see below). However, these lesions cannot be detected at other loci such
as c-myc despite strong evidence that AID produces DSBs in this gene (Robbiani et al.,
2008). Genetic experiments that use the restriction enzyme I-Sce1 to create breaks in either
IgH, c-myc or both in the presence or absence of AID show that AID is required to produce
the DSBs at both loci. However, AID-generated breaks at IgH are more frequent than at cmyc, and the DSBs in c-myc are limiting for translocation (Robbiani et al., 2008; Wang et al.,
2009). Which other non-Ig genes besides c-myc are susceptible to AID-mediated DSB
formation, and how this compares to the degree to which these genes are somatically mutated
has yet to be determined. An indication that DSBs and mutation in non-Ig genes are correlated
comes from the recent finding that Igβ, which is a known target for hypermutation by AID, is
also a substrate for translocation to IgH in stimulated B cells(Jankovic et al., 2010)[RK2].
Finally, deregulated expression of AID leads to chromatid breaks and translocations involving
nearly every chromosome, which suggests that AID can produce DNA breaks in a diverse
group of genes throughout the genome (Robbiani et al., 2009). Thus, it is likely that many
genes somatically mutated by AID also harbor DNA breaks that can serve as substrates for
chromosome translocation.
Combined action of RAG1/2 and AID
RAG1/2 and AID are usually expressed in distinct B cell developmental compartments. High
levels of RAG1/2 are found in developing B cells in the bone marrow, whereas AID expression
is found in mature B cells responding to antigen in the periphery. Assuming that DSBs are
rapidly repaired, RAG1/2-induced breaks and AID breaks should not coexist; therefore, they
should not be joined in chromosome translocations. However, RAG-induced DSBs can persist,
especially in the absence of the ataxia telangiectasia mutated kinase (ATM), an essential DNA
damage checkpoint regulator that prevents the long-term persistence of DSBs (Callen et al.,
2009a; Callen et al., 2007)[RK3]. Cells that escape this checkpoint can have a DSB at the
IgH locus even after RAG expression is extinguished and therefore these lesions could be
paired with DSBs created by AID (Callen et al., 2007).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

A second mechanism that facilitates translocation between RAG1/2 and AID breaks is the loss
of the non-homologous end joining factor XRCC4 (Wang et al., 2009). Conditional deletion
of this core component of the non-homologous end joining machinery in mature B cells
deficient in p53 leads to B cell lymphomas that carry tumor promoting c-myc/IgH
translocations, as well as translocations between the Igλ variable regions and IgH switch
regions (Wang et al., 2008). These Igλ-IgH passenger translocations appear to be the result of
secondary V(D)J recombination (Wang et al., 2009), also known as receptor editing (Jankovic
et al., 2004). This reaction appears to be mediated by delayed extinction of RAG1/2 expression,
although the possibility of RAG re-induction cannot be ruled out definitively (Jankovic et al.,
2004). The abnormal or delayed repair of RAG1/2-mediated DSBs in XRCC4 deficient cells,
or potentially more rarely in normal cells, might promote overlap between the lesions created
by the two Ig recombinases; this in turn could produce B cells in which both RAG1/2 and AID
breaks coexist (Wang et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2009).

Finally, an analysis of an extensive panel of human chromosome translocations suggests that
AID might facilitate off-target DSB formation by RAG1/2. According to this model, the low
level AID expression in developing B cells in the bone marrow would create U:G mismatches
that lead to the formation of non-B-DNA targets for RAG1/2, in genes like Bcl-2 (Tsai et al.,
2008).
In conclusion, both RAG1/2 and AID can produce DSBs in Ig and non-Ig genes. The majority
of RAG1/2 breaks are usually found in developing B cells, whereas the AID breaks are usually
found in mature activated B cells. However, a number of mechanisms can facilitate the overlap
between the two, and thus might account for translocations between RAG1/2 and AIDmediated DSBs.

Repair pathways in Aberrant chromosome joining
Non-homologous end joining and homologous recombination
There are two well-described pathways that mediate DSB repair in mammalian cells: NHEJ
and homologous recombination (HR) (Figure 3).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

NHEJ directly religates broken DNA, which can result in the loss of genetic material
(Weinstock et al., 2006). Although this type of end-joining can be active in any phase of the
cell cycle and can compete with HR, it is essential for DSB repair in G0/G1; therefore it plays
a major role in V(D)J recombination, class switching and antigen receptor diversificationassociated chromosome translocations (Chaudhuri et al., 2007; Jankovic et al., 2007). The
absence of any of the core NHEJ components leads to severe combined immunodeficiency,
due to the inability to properly repair RAG breaks (de Villartay, 2009; Sleckman, 2005). Most
of the core NHEJ factors (Ku70/80, XRCC4, Lig4) are also required for the efficient repair of
AID breaks during class switching (Chaudhuri et al., 2007; Jankovic et al., 2007). However,
the requirement for core NHEJ factors in switching is not absolute, and alternative end joining
pathways (A-NHEJ) that function in the absence of Ku70/80, Lig4, and XRCC4 (Figure 3) can
mediate CSR at rates of up to 50% of normal (Boboila et al., 2010a, b; Pan-Hammarstrom et
al., 2005; Soulas-Sprauel et al., 2007; Yan et al., 2007).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

In contrast to NHEJ, repair of DSBs by HR utilizes the intact homologous chromatid as a
complementary template; therefore, HR occurs primarily in S/G2/M (Figure 3). HR requires
DSB resection to produce ssDNA substrates for homology search. Specifically, DNA ends
must undergo 5′-3′ resection to generate 3′ ssDNA that recruits the RAD51 recombinase which
mediates homologous pairing and strand invasion (Takeda et al., 2007) (Figure 3). DSB
processing to ssDNA requires the formation of a complex that includes BRCA11, the MRN
complex (Mre11/Rad50/Nbs1) and CtIP (Chen et al., 2008;Sartori et al., 2007;Yun and Hiom,
2009) as well as Blooms Helicase and Exo1(Gravel et al., 2008). In this context, Mre11
functions as a nuclease that is required for both DSB resection and HR (Buis et al., 2008;Paull
and Gellert, 1998;Sartori et al., 2007). Finally, although DSB resection is essential for HR in
the S/G2 phase of the cell cycle, DSB resection also occurs in G0/G1 (Yun and Hiom, 2009)
where it may facilitate microhomology based alternative end joining (A-NHEJ) during class
switching (Bothmer et al., 2010) and chromosome translocation (Simsek and Jasin).
HR in translocation
Both NHEJ and HR are likely to play important roles in chromosome translocation (Weinstock
et al., 2006). Consistent with this notion, there are several rare “chromosomal breakage”
diseases that predispose to chromosomal translocation and cancer. Each of the genes mutated
in these diseases encode proteins involved in DNA DSB repair. For example, Fanconi anemia,
which is associated with bone marrow failure, blood and solid tumors, is caused by mutations
in one of 13 complementation groups, FANC A-N, some of which are implicated in HR

(Moldovan and D'Andrea, 2009); Nijmegen breakage syndrome and ataxia telangiectasia,
which are associated with an increased risk of lymphoma, arise from mutation in Nbs1 and
ATM respectively, both of which function in NHEJ and HR (Shiloh, 2003); finally, inherited
breast cancer is frequently associated with mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2, both of which are
essential for HR (Venkitaraman, 2002).
In the absence of HR, cells experience an increase in general genomic instability (Sonoda et
al., 1998) and a specific increase in the frequency of breaks at so-called fragile sites, which are
large genomic regions prone to damage during replication stress (Arlt et al., 2006). In addition
to DNA breakage, loss of BRCA1, BRCA2, BLM, or other HR proteins leads to the
accumulation of radial and quasi-radial structures, in which sister chromatids from different
(homologous or non-homologous) chromosomes fuse together (Venkitaraman, 2002). If the
resulting radial type structure contains more than one centromere, then dicentric chromosome
rupture during DNA replication could result in breakage-bridge fusion cycles that may
eventually lead to the propagation of a “stable” chromosomal translocation. Chromatid breaks
that accumulate in Brca1 deficient cells are aberrantly joined by a Lig4 dependent mechanism
leading to the formation of radial structures (Bunting et al., 2010).
NHEJ and translocation

Although classical NHEJ (C-NHEJ) core proteins are essential for intra-chromosomal joining
during V(D)J recombination and play an important role in class switching, their role in
translocations appears to lie in suppressing rather than mediating these aberrant joining events.
As was first shown in fibroblasts, loss of Ku80 and Lig4 leads to a massive increase in the
frequency of spontaneous DNA breaks and chromosomal translocations (Difilippantonio et al.,
2000; Ferguson et al., 2000; Karanjawala et al., 1999). Consistent with these results,
translocations induced by RAG1/2, I-Sce1, or AID do not require Ku70, Ku80, DNA-PKcs,
or XRCC4 (Boboila et al., 2010b; Callen et al., 2009b; Ramiro et al., 2006; Wang et al.,
2009; Weinstock et al., 2007). On the contrary, the absence of Ku, XRCC4, Lig4, Artemis, or
DNA-PKcs leads to the accumulation of AID-dependent DNA breaks and translocations in
stimulated B cells (Boboila et al., 2010b; Franco et al., 2008; Yan et al., 2007). The absence
of C-NHEJ factors may promote abnormal joining by increasing the number of DSB
translocation substrates due to inefficient repair in cis, making it more probable that
microhomology based A-NHEJ pathways fuse the ends together (see below).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

A-NHEJ pathways are implicated in chromosomal translocations on the basis of
microhomology at the translocation breakpoints of some human cancers including nonlymphoid cancers (Weinstock et al., 2006). In mice, A-NHEJ is thought to mediate fusionbridge-fusion translocations arising in B cell lymphomas in C-NHEJ/p53 double-deficient
mice because the translocation junctions show microhomology (Difilippantonio et al., 2002;
Zhu et al., 2002). In addition, reciprocal chromosome translocations between c-myc and IgH
are C-NHEJ independent (Boboila et al., 2010b; Ramiro et al., 2006; Yan et al., 2007). Thus,
A-NHEJ appears to be particularly active in chromosome translocations.
The A-NHEJ pathway was first described in mammalian cells by Roth and Wilson (Roth and
Wilson, 1986). Although work from a number of laboratories and in different systems indicates
that this is a robust pathway (Boboila et al., 2010a; Pan-Hammarstrom et al., 2005; SoulasSprauel et al., 2007; Yan et al., 2007), very little is known about the molecular components
that mediate A-NHEJ. A-NHEJ appears to be conserved in yeast (McVey and Lee, 2008), may
be kinetically slower than classical NHEJ (Boboila et al., 2010a; Han and Yu, 2008; Xie et al.,
2009), and is biased towards microhomology mediated joins (typically 5-25 bp homologous
sequences at the DSB junctions) (Haber, 2008; Zha et al., 2009). In contrast, classical NHEJ
pathways anneal blunt ends or short (<4 bp) homologous sequences (Haber, 2008; Zha et al.,
2009).

Among the repair factors implicated in A-NHEJ are Mre11 and CtIP, which form a complex
that regulates the initial DNA end resection at breaks, thereby exposing homologous ssDNA
sequences for annealing (Bennardo et al., 2008; Deriano et al., 2009; Dinkelmann et al.,
2009; Rass et al., 2009; Sartori et al., 2007; Xie et al., 2009; Yun and Hiom, 2009) (Figure 3).
Loss of Mre11 decreases the joining efficiency between two I-SceI DSBs (Rass et al., 2009)
and over-expression increases end resection and A-NHEJ suggesting a role for Mre11 in DNA
end resection and alternative end-joining. Interestingly, another member of the complex that
is essential for resection, BRCA1, is required for HR but is dispensable for A-NHEJ (Yun and
Hiom, 2009). Other repair factors that may function in A-NHEJ and also as backup repair
factors to C-NHEJ include the single-strand break repair proteins DNA Ligase III (Lig3),
XRCC1, and Poly (ADP-Ribose) Polymerase I (PARPI) (Robert et al., 2009; Wang et al.,
2006) (Figure 3). These proteins normally function in ssDNA repair, but might also act upon
processed DSBs during A-NHEJ (Haber, 2008; Zha et al., 2009).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Alternative end joining may also mediate chromosomal fusions that occur in response to
telomere erosion (Palm and de Lange, 2008). Loss of telomeric sequences results in the failure
of DNA end protection, and chromosomal end fusions ensue. Like translocation, fusion of short
telomeres occurs independently of the end joining factors DNA-PKcs, ATM, and Lig4 (Maser
et al., 2007; Wong et al., 2003). In fission yeast, chromosomal fusions induced by telomere
attrition are also independent of NHEJ, but require the homologous recombination proteins
Rad52 and ERCC1, which participate in single strand annealing (Wang and Baumann, 2008).
Single strand annealing is a conserved pathway that repairs DSBs arising between long (>30
nt) flanking direct repeats via a mechanism involving annealing of the homologous ssDNA
sequences. Single strand annealing requires DSB processing and is dependent on Brca1 and
CtIP (Bennardo et al., 2008; Stark et al., 2004). In summary, the repair pathways involved in
translocation are unknown, but may involve single-strand DNA formation.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Although A-NHEJ is utilized when C-NHEJ is compromised, the extent to which it is active
under physiological conditions and how the choice is made between the two pathways remains
unclear. For example, a recent study analyzed the junctions of c-myc/IgH translocations
produced in wild-type B cells (Robbiani et al., 2008). Half of the translocation junctions are
blunt and the other half show only 1-3 bp homology, which would be consistent with the known
properties of C-NHEJ (Robbiani et al., 2008). This distribution and lack of extensive
microhomology is similar to junctions formed during normal class switch recombination (Yan
et al., 2007). This contrasts with translocation breakpoints found in the absence of C-NHEJ or
by I-Sce1-induced DSBs in AID deficient B cells (Robbiani et al., 2008) or embryonic stem
(ES) cells (Weinstock et al., 2007), which involve more extensive processing and microhomology-mediated joining. End processing is inhibited by 53BP1 (Bothmer et al., 2010;
Bunting et al., 2010). Loss of this factor promotes HR (Bunting et al., 2010) and
microhomology mediated joining (Bothmer et al., 2010), and greatly alleviates replication
associated genetic instability in Brca1 deficient cells (Bunting et al., 2010).
Focus forming factors
Several DNA damage response proteins such as Nbs1, ATM and 53BP1 accumulate in the
chromatin region surrounding a DSB, forming what are called DNA damage repair
‘foci’ (Fernandez-Capetillo et al., 2003) (Figure 4). Others, like the classical NHEJ proteins,
seem to bind directly to DSBs but do not accumulate in regions distal to the break sites (BekkerJensen et al., 2006). For example, foci forming proteins Nbs1, phosphorylated histone H2AX
(γ-H2AX) and 53BP1 accumulate on the IgH locus in response to AID-mediated breaks during
class switching (Petersen et al., 2001) and on antigen receptor genes undergoing RAG1/2
dependent V(D)J recombination in thymocytes (Chen et al., 2000; Savic et al., 2009). The
ability of proteins to form foci is dependent on prior phosphorylation of histone H2AX (γ-

H2AX) (Celeste et al., 2002), a chromatin mark that spreads over a region spanning thousands
to millions of base pairs of DNA (Rogakou et al., 1998). γ-H2AX is believed to serve as an
anchor for stabilizing the binding of other focus forming factors to chromatin (Bassing and
Alt, 2004; Fernandez-Capetillo et al., 2003), including the recently discovered histone ubiquitin
E3 ligase RNF8 (Figure 4).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

In addition to accumulating in foci at sites of antigen receptor gene recombination, Nbs1, γH2AX, ATM, RNF8, and 53BP1 are also required for the efficient completion of normal class
switch recombination (Jankovic et al., 2007; Ramachandran et al., 2010; Santos et al., 2010),
and some of these factors also contribute to V(D)J recombination (Bassing et al., 2003;
Bredemeyer et al., 2006; Celeste et al., 2003; Difilippantonio et al., 2008; Helmink et al.,
2009). However, their role in these reactions is not completely understood. For example, the
loss of 53BP1 in B cells undergoing CSR reduces the frequency of long-range joining between
different switch regions; however, short-range intra-switch joints appear to be increased
(Reina-San-Martin et al., 2007), in part because of increased resection (Bothmer et al., 2010;
Bunting et al., 2010) which facilitates microhomology mediated A-NHEJ between repetitive
switch sequences (Bothmer et al., 2010). Similarly, 53BP1 appears to be essential for repairing
a subset of V(D)J recombination-induced ends, specifically those separated by long distances
(Difilippantonio et al., 2008). RNF8 is required for 53BP1 foci formation, yet the CSR defect
in RNF8 knockout mice is milder than that observed in the absence of 53BP1 (Ramachandran
et al., 2010; Santos et al., 2010). Thus, in both CSR and V(D)J joining, loss of focus forming
factors affects only a subset of joints and not end ligation per se. There are several models that
could explain these phenomena, including the possibility that 53BP1 stabilizes or promotes
long-range chromosomal interactions (Difilippantonio et al., 2008), increases chromatin
mobility (Dimitrova et al., 2008) or alters the repair pathway choice between C-NHEJ and ANHEJ (Bothmer et al., 2010).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Many of the focus forming factors are also essential to maintaining genomic stability and in
their absence cells suffer an increase in chromosomal translocations. For example, the loss of
either Nbs1, γ-H2AX, ATM, or 53BP1 leads to high levels of chromosomal aberrations during
class switching, which are divided among general chromosomal aberrations and those
occurring specifically at antigen receptor loci (Jankovic et al., 2007). Furthermore, mutant mice
that fail to express these factors are predisposed to cancer (Jankovic et al., 2007). Finally, the
combined loss of ATM and DNA-PKcs leads to a synergistic increase in genomic instability
as well as additive defects in class-switching, indicating that these proteins act redundantly in
lymphocytes (Callen et al., 2009b). In summary, like NHEJ and HR proteins, focus-forming
factors are not essential for inter-chromosome exchanges. On the contrary, their absence
appears to result in aberrant or inefficient DSB repair in G0/G1, which may increase the
availability of DSB substrates for translocation. In contrast, absence of 53BP1 reduces
chromosomal instability in S phase and cancer predisposition in Brca1 deficient cells (Bunting
et al., 2010; Cao et al., 2009).
Translocation between c-myc and IgH
c-myc/IgH translocations belong to a special subset of translocations that trigger oncogenic
stress (Collado et al., 2007). Deregulated expression of oncogenes causes activation of the
tumor suppressors ARF and ATM, which in turn trigger p53 dependent senescence or cell death
(Collado et al., 2007). This provides a barrier that protects cells against propagating the
oncogenic translocation. Consistent with this notion, loss of Nbs1 (ATM activator), ATM,
ARF, and p53 increases the frequency of c-myc/IgH but not Igβ/IgH translocations in primary
B cells (Jankovic et al., 2010; Ramiro et al., 2006; Robbiani et al., 2009); mutations in ARF/
p53 promote myc-induced lymphomagenesis (Eischen et al., 1999; Schmitt et al., 1999);
deregulated AID expression causes cancer when p53 is disrupted (Robbiani et al., 2009); and

B cell lymphomas almost invariably carry mutations in these proteins in addition to
translocations (Kuppers, 2005). Such secondary tumor-suppressor gene mutations may be
necessary to avoid pathways that trigger cell death; they appear to play a critical role in many
tumors besides those of lymphoid origin (Halazonetis et al., 2008).
Interestingly, and in contrast to ATM, disruption of H2AX or 53BP1 does not affect the rate
of c-myc/IgH translocation. However, their loss markedly increases IgH-associated
translocations to targets other than c-myc (Franco et al., 2006; Ramiro et al., 2006). One
potential explanation for this paradox is that c-myc/IgH triggers an oncogenic stress signal that
eliminates cells that carry this translocation, whereas Ig translocations to other regions may
not be toxic. Support for this notion comes from the observation that the rate of translocation
between IgH and Igβ (another AID target) is not altered by loss of p53 in the same cells that
suffer increased c-myc/IgH translocations (Jankovic et al., 2010). Instead, alternative pathways
that include BAFF, Bcl-XL, and PKC-δ protect cells against DNA damage in the absence of
oncogenic stress (Jankovic et al., 2010).
In summary, the loss of either NHEJ or HR or focus-forming factors leads to an increase in the
frequency of translocation and cancer predisposition. We speculate that the loss of these factors
increases translocation because bona fide DSB repair is less efficient, resulting in an increase
in untethered ends that are available for intermingling, DSB processing and aberrant joining.

The role of nuclear positioning in translocation
In addition to being organized into nucleosomes, chromosomes are found in defined spatially
segregated nuclear territories that are in part correlated with transcriptional activity
(Lieberman-Aiden et al., 2009). Physical proximity between translocated loci in the nucleus
is an additional factor that may impact the frequency of translocation between chromosomes.
For example, c-myc and IgH are frequently colocalized in primary B cells but not in other cell
types (Osborne et al., 2007; Wang et al., 2009). Importantly, this co-localization is found in
resting B cells prior to AID-induced damage at c-myc and IgH, indicating that these loci are
spatially proximal before DSBs are formed (Wang et al., 2009). The mechanisms that bring
disparate loci together in the nucleus are poorly understood; however, it has been proposed
that loci that share transcriptional regulation are more likely to be found together (Spilianakis
et al., 2005). However, accessibility for translocation does not appear to require transcription,
given that even transcriptionally silent c-myc is in an accessible nuclear compartment that
permits c-myc/IgH translocation (Robbiani et al., 2008).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Quantitative high resolution studies find that DSBs exhibit limited mobility similar to the
random movement of undamaged chromatin (Kruhlak et al., 2006; Soutoglou et al., 2007). In
contrast, a recent study of the dynamics of telomere fusions demonstrates that 53BP1 promotes
end joining of dysfunctional telomeres by increasing chromatin mobility (Dimitrova et al.,
2008). They provide evidence that uncapped telomeres are more mobile and sample larger
territories than normal telomeres in a manner dependent on 53BP1(Dimitrova et al., 2008).
The implication is that 53BP1 changes the dynamic behavior of chromatin to facilitate NHEJ
reactions involving distant sites (Dimitrova et al., 2008). The potential role of 53BP1 or other
factors in influencing chromatin dynamics, position, and translocation is an important topic
that is actively being investigated.

Conclusions
Paired DSBs are obligate intermediates for chromosomal translocation. Antigen receptor
diversification reactions in lymphoid cells require the formation of DSBs that can serve as
substrates for translocations. Importantly, the enzymes that produce DSBs in antigen receptor

loci, RAG1/2 and AID, can also produce DNA lesions in non-antigen receptor genes, including
oncogenes that can be paired with breaks in antigen receptor loci to form translocations.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Over the last decade, considerable progress has been made in understanding the way in which
cells maintain genomic stability and avoid chromosomal translocations in the face of continual
DNA damage produced during normal cellular metabolism including antigen receptor gene
recombination. Many of the factors that mediate DNA repair by HR and NHEJ also suppress
translocation in normal cells. In the absence of these factors, mice and humans are prone to
cancer-inducing chromosomal translocations. An understanding of the mechanisms involved
in the creation, signaling, and repair of DSBs will help target the activity of tumor-promoting
oncogenes, as well as that of caretaker and gatekeeper genes whose loss contributes to tumor
initiation and progression.

Figure 1. Misrepair of DNA breaks cause chromosomal translocations[RK4]

Chromosomal translocations require formation of paired double strand DNA breaks (DSBs)
on different chromosomes. DSBs can be repaired in cis, or can result in chromosomal
translocation by rearrangement between non homologous chromosomes. Depending on the
topology of the rearrangement, the translocation can be reciprocal (balanced or unbalanced)
or non-reciprocal. The majority of translocations associated with cancer in human lymphoid
tumors involve balanced chromosomal translocations, whereas epithelial cancers usually carry
complex nonreciprocal translocations.

Figure 2. Antigen diversification reactions in lymphocytes

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Lymphocyte antigen receptor diversity is established in developing lymphocytes by V(D)J
recombination. Recombinase-activating genes 1 and 2 (RAG1 and RAG2), are transesterases
that introduce double strand breaks (DSBs) at recombination signal sequences (shown in
triangles) that flank V, D, and J gene segments. These DSBs are repaired by the NHEJ pathway.
Mature B cells undergo two additional diversification reactions called somatic hypermutation
and class switch recombination. These two processes are initiated by AID, a single strand DNA
deaminase that mutates cytidine residues to uracyl. Cytdine deamination at V regions leads to
somatic mutation whereas the same alteration in switch (S) regions causes class switching.
AID generated mismatches in DNA are processed by base-exision repair (BER), mismatch
repair (MMR), and error prone polymerases to generate mutations during somatic
hypermutation. These lesions can also be converted to a DSB, an obligate intermediate during
class switch recombination. These DSBs are detected and processed by foci forming factors,
nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) and alternative end joining [RK5](A-NHEJ). Accurate
repair of DSBs by foci forming factors and NHEJ is necessary to prevent chromosomal
translocation. Most lymphoid cancers carry chromosomal translocations that involve RAG1/2
or AID target genes. Eμ, intronic enhancer; 3′E, 3′ enhancer.

Figure 3. Repair of DNA double strand breaks

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Two major mechanisms that repair double strand breaks (DSBs) include homologous
recombination (HR) and non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). HR repairs DSBs by using an
intact copy of the broken chromosome as template and is restricted in S and G2 phases of the
cell cycle. HR is initiated by 5′-3′ resection of DSBs to form single stranded DNA. A complex
of BRCA1, MRN, and CtIP is required for DSB resection. After ssDNA generation, a RAD51
nucleoprotein filament facilitated by BRCA2 is formed that initiates strand invasion of the
intact sister chromatid. After DNA synthesis, the ends are eventually rejoined to yield the intact
products. During NHEJ, DNA ends are recognized by the Ku70/80 heterodimer and DNAPKcs. They are then processed by a complex consisting of Artemeis, XLF, XRCC4 and Lig4.
Alternative NHEJ (A-NHEJ) pathways may also function as a backup to classical NHEJ. NHEJ
and HR components are caretakers that maintain genomic stability by suppressing
chromosomal translocations.

Figure 4. Evolution of a DNA repair focus

A focus represents large-scale accumulation of factors in the chromatin flanking a double strand
break (DSB). MRN recognizes the DSBs, and recruits and activates ATM, a kinase that
phosphorylates numerous factors at DSBs including histone H2AX and MDC1. Two E3
ubiquitin ligases RNF8 and RNF168 (coupled with the E2 enzyme UBC13) promote local
chromatin ubiquitination, including ubiquitination of H2A histones. RNF8 and RNF168
promote chromatin retention of 53BP1 and Brca1. Modifications of histones may allow
exposure of partially occluded histone methyl marks, which facilitates retention of 53BP1. The
complex of Rap80/Brca1 interacts directly with ubiquitinated histones. Foci formation
