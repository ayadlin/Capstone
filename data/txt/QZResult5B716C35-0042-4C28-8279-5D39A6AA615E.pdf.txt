Abstract
Inhibitors against the p110δ isoform of PI3K have shown remarkable therapeutic efficacy in some
human leukaemias1,2. Since p110δ is primarily expressed in leukocytes3, drugs against p110δ have
not been considered for the treatment of solid tumours4. We report here that p110δ inactivation in

mice protects against a broad range of cancers, including non-haematological solid tumours. We
demonstrate that p110δ inactivation in regulatory T cells (Treg) unleashes CD8+ cytotoxic T cells
and induces tumour regression. Thus, p110δ inhibitors can break tumour-induced immune
tolerance and should be considered for wider use in oncology.

PI3K p110δD910A (δD910A) mice in which endogenous p110δ kinase is inactive, present
specific immune deficiencies5,6 but are not predisposed to cancer. To test if host p110δ
activity affects tumour growth, we inoculated weakly immunogenic syngeneic cancer cell
lines into δD910A mice. Compared to wild-type (WT) mice, δD910A mice were more resistant
to B16 melanoma, with reduced tumour incidence and almost abrogated lymph node
metastasis in those mice that developed tumours (Fig. 1a). Growth of Lewis lung carcinoma
(LLC) and EL4 thymoma cells was also suppressed in δD910A mice (Fig. 1b,c). Similar
observations were made with luciferase-labelled 4T1 breast cancer cells injected into the
mammary fat pad. At sacrifice, δD910A mice showed reduced mass and luciferase activity of
the primary 4T1 tumour (Fig. 1d) and lower metastasis (Fig. 1e). In WT mice, 4T1 tumours
were detected by day 10 and grew progressively until day 30, at which point the mice
became moribund (Fig. 1f). In some δD910A mice, 4T1 tumours grew initially, but then
started to regress from day 15-20 onwards (Fig. 1f). Across 10 independent experiments,
97% (71/73) of WT mice had an observable cancer mass at the end of study, compared to
65% (43/66) of δD910A mice, with a median survival time of 23 and 40 days in WT and
δD910A mice, respectively (Fig. 1g).

Effective tumour immunity is limited by Treg-mediated immune suppression7. δD910A mice
show enhanced FoxP3+CD4+ Treg in the thymus but impaired subsequent Treg maintenance
and functionality in the periphery8. δD910A Treg also produce less IL-10 and express lower
levels of CD38, but show normal expression of most ‘Treg-signature’ genes, including
FoxP3, CD25, CTLA4 and ICOS8,9. We therefore considered that reduced Treg function in
δD910A mice might lead to enhanced tumour resistance. FoxP3+CD4+ Treg in the draining
lymph nodes of 4T1 tumour-bearing δD910A mice did not expand as robustly as in WT mice
(Fig. 2a), however no consistent differences in Treg expansion were observed in the B16 or
EL4 tumour models between naive and tumour-bearing mice of either genotype (not shown).
To assess Treg function, we carried out adoptive Treg transfer experiments in EL4 tumourbearing mice. Transfer of WT Treg into δD910A mice restored EL4 tumour growth and
suppressed the relative abundance of tumour-infiltrating CD8+ T cells (Fig. 2b). By contrast,
the transfer of the same number of δD910A Treg into δD910A mice did not affect EL4 tumour
growth (Fig. 2b), indicating a functional defect in δD910A Treg. FoxP3YFP-Crexδflox/flox mice
in which p110δ was selectively deleted in Treg (by a Cre transgene expressed from the
Foxp3 locus) did not display spontaneous autoimmune or inflammatory responses (not
shown) but showed reduced growth of B16 cells (Fig. 2c) and extended survival time upon
inoculation of EL4 cells, to an even greater extent than in δD910A mice (Fig. 2d). These data
demonstrate that p110δ inactivation in Treg is both necessary and sufficient to confer
tumour resistance. However, these data also revealed a potential negative impact of p110δ
inhibition on effector T cells, since FoxP3YFP-Crexδflox/flox mice were more cancer-resistant
than δD910A mice (Fig. 2d). We therefore investigated the effect of p110δ inactivation on
CD4 and CD8 effector T cells in the context of an ongoing tumour response.

Depletion of CD8+ T cells but not of CD4+ T cells on day 10 after 4T1 inoculation in
δD910A mice eliminated cancer protection (Fig. 3a,b). These data show that CD8+ T cells are
responsible for restricting tumour growth in δD910A mice, but do not exclude an accessory
role for CD4+ T cells. In line with published data5, naive WT mice had higher relative
numbers of activated/memory CD44highCD4+ and CD44highCD8+ T cells than δD910A mice
(Extended Data Fig. 1a). Upon 4T1 inoculation in WT mice, the relative numbers of these
cells were either enhanced (tumour-draining lymph nodes) or reduced (blood and spleen),
but in δD910A mice showed a trend towards expansion (Extended Data Fig. 1a), indicating
that δD910A mice are capable of mounting both CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses against
4T1 tumours. WT and δD910A splenocytes from tumour-bearing mice, incubated in vitro
with mitomycin C-treated 4T1 cells, generated equivalent cytotoxic activity against 4T1,
with no specific lysis of LLC (Fig. 3c). Compared to WT cultures, δD910A cultures contained
similar proportions of CD4 and CD8 T cell subsets (Extended Data Fig. 1b), with a reduced
frequency of activated/memory CD44highCD4+ cells (Fig. 3d) and unaffected frequency of
CD44high CD8+ cells (Fig. 3d). Interestingly, despite this reduced proportion of δD910A
CD44highCD4+ cells, the frequency of IFNγ+ CD4+ cells in PMA/ionomycin-stimulated
cultures of splenocytes from 4T1 tumour-bearing mice was unaffected by p110δ inactivation
(Fig. 3e), with the frequency of IFNγ+ CD8+ cells even enhanced upon p110δ inactivation
(Fig. 3e). Upon inoculation with LLC-OVA, WT and δD910A mice generated similar levels
of tumour-infiltrating OVA-specific CD8+ T cells (Fig. 3f), showing that systemic in vivo
inactivation of p110δ does not impede the development or recruitment of antigen-specific
anti-tumour CD8+ cells.

To test the intrinsic ability of δD910A CD8 T cells to eliminate tumours, we crossed δD910A
mice to OT-I transgenic mice which carry an OVA-specific MHC class I-restricted TCR
transgene. In vitro generated δD910A OT-I CTLs were less efficient than WT OT-I CTLs at
EL4-OVA killing (Fig. 3g) and produced lower levels of cytotoxic mediators (Extended
Data Fig. 1c). Pharmacological inactivation of p110δ during the in vitro CTL expansion of
WT OT-I cells partially suppressed CTL function, in a manner indistinguishable from
genetic inactivation of p110δ (Fig. 3g), whereas p110δ blockade during the killing phase
itself did not affect CTL function (Fig. 3g). Despite these in vitro defects in δD910A OT-I
CTLs, adoptive transfer of these cells in WT mice prior to challenge with EL4-OVA,
provided equal cancer protection to inoculation of WT OT-I T cells (Fig. 3h), showing that
in vivo CTL responses can remain competent in the absence of CD8 T cell-intrinsic p110δ
activity. Taken together, these data indicate that p110δ inhibition impairs differentiation of
CD8 T cells to become fully competent CTL; however, fully differentiated CTL do not seem
to require p110δ activity to kill target cells and on balance, in the context of reduced Treg
function in δD910A mice, can mediate effective anti-tumour activity.
CD4 T cells can also contribute to tumour elimination by promoting the activation of
macrophages and NK cells or by direct lysis of MHC class II+ tumour cells10. Indeed, CD4+
T cells with enhanced PI3K activity are superior in their capacity to reject tumour growth,
probably as a consequence of their increased production of IFNγ11. Conversely, δD910A OTII CD4 cells were less effective than WT OT-II cells in preventing EL4-OVA tumour
growth (Fig. 3h), consistent with our previous finding that δD910A OT-II T cells produce less

IFNγ in vitro and in vivo12,13. Therefore, in the context of an otherwise normal immune
system, δD910A CD4+ cells show inferior anti-tumour immunity. However, the production of
IFNγ by CD4 and CD8 T cells from 4T1 tumour-bearing δD910A mice, where Treg are also
defective, appeared to be intact (Fig. 3e), suggesting that p110δ inhibition can affect the
balance between regulatory and effector CD4+ T cells such that the effector cells prevail in
the context of anti-tumour responses.
A salient feature of CD4 and CD8 T cells is the ability to raise a more potent and rapid
immune response to subsequent exposure to cognate antigen. Upon surgical removal of 4T1
primary tumours when they had reached 9 mm diameter and established metastatic foci14,
WT mice all succumbed to re-growth of the primary tumour and metastatic disease. In
contrast, >50% of post-surgical δD910A mice showed survival extension beyond 100 days
(Fig. 3i), demonstrating that p110δ inhibition can suppress cancer relapse and presumably
metastatic cancer after surgery. δD910A mice which had remained tumour-free >200 days
after surgery were cancer-resistant upon rechallenge with a higher 4T1 dose (Fig. 3j),
suggesting that surgical intervention in δD910A mice supports the development of an
effective memory anti-tumour response.

To assess the potential importance of p110δ in myeloid cells in cancer, we tested the impact
of p110δ inactivation in Rag−/− mice. Rag−/− mice, which lack mature B and T cells, showed
enhanced primary 4T1 tumour size and metastasis (Fig. 4a) compared to WT mice.
Rag−/−xδD910A mice showed similar 4T1 primary tumour burden as Rag−/− mice (Fig. 4a)
but had fewer metastatic lesions in lung (Fig. 4a) and liver (not shown), indicating that
p110δ inactivation in a non-B/T cell lineage delays 4T1 tumour progression but is not
sufficient to instigate tumour rejection. We next assessed the impact of p110δ inactivation
on myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), a heterogeneous population of bone marrowderived myeloid cells that co-express the CD11b and Gr1 surface markers and which play a
prominent role in immune suppression in cancer15,16. Neutrophils are also CD11b+Gr1+ but
are thought not to be immune-suppressive17. Upon inoculation with 4T1 cells, known to be
potent MDSC inducers16,17, CD11b+Gr1high cells accumulated in the spleens of both WT
and δD910A mice, even before tumours were palpable, and continued to differentially
accumulate in both genotypes as tumours grew, correlating with tumour size (Fig. 4b). The
Ly6C and Ly6G surface markers, which are both recognized by the Gr1 antibody, have been
used to subdivide MDSCs into two CD11b+ subpopulations, namely monocytic (M)MDSCs (Ly6ChighLy6Glow) and polymorphonuclear (PMN)-MDSCs
(Ly6C-/lowLy6Ghigh)17. Although neutrophils are difficult to differentiate from PMNMDSCs, here we designated the neutrophil population as Ly6Ghigh cells with intermediate/
high Ly6C expression (Fig. 4c, Extended Data Fig. 2a). PMN-MDSCs, predominant in 4T1
tumour-bearing WT mice (Fig. 4c), were substantially reduced in δD910A mice, correlating
with a relative increase in neutrophils in the latter (Fig. 4c). Interestingly, the number of
PMN-MDSCs in spleens from 4T1 tumour-bearing mice correlated with the number of
Tregs (Fig. 4d). Depletion of CD8+ cells in 4T1 tumour-bearing δD910A mice, which led to
enhanced tumour growth (Fig. 3a,b), also led to increased PMN-MDSC numbers and
reduced neutrophil numbers (Fig. 4e). It was therefore difficult to ascertain whether the
reduced PMN-MDSC numbers in δD910A mice are a consequence of an intrinsic role for

p110δ in these cells or an indirect consequence of a reduced tumour burden in δD910A mice
(Fig. 4b). In support of the former, WT PMN-MDSCs suppressed T cell proliferation in
vitro, whereas MDSCs from δD910A mice with regressing tumours did not (Fig. 4f; Extended
Data Fig. 2b). Neutrophils from both genotypes did not suppress T cell responses (Fig. 4f).
Moreover, splenocytes from tumour-bearing δD910A mice showed reduced in vitro
production of TGFβ, VEGF and IL-6 (Fig. 4g), each of which can contribute to immune
suppression and/or tumour growth15,16.
Administration of PI-3065, a small molecule inhibitor with selectivity for p110δ (Extended
Data Fig. 3a,b and Extended Data Table 1), also suppressed 4T1 tumour growth and
metastasis, to a similar extent as genetic inactivation of p110δ, marked by initial tumour
progression, followed by tumour regression (Fig. 5a; Extended Data Fig. 3c,d). Of interest,
4T1 do not express detectable levels of p110δ (Extended Data Fig. 3e) and are not growthinhibited in vitro by PI-3065 (Extended Data Fig. 3f). Long-term administration of PI-3065
to mice was well-tolerated and did not induce weight loss (Extended Data Fig. 3g).
We next tested the impact of PI-3056 in the KPC model of pancreatic ductal
adenocarcinoma (PDAC), which expresses endogenous mutant KrasG12D and p53R172H
genes in Pdx1+ pancreatic cells. KPC mice were left to develop palpable disease before
treatment with vehicle or PI-3065 was commenced. Under these therapeutic conditions,
PI-3065 prolonged survival and reduced the incidence of metastases and other diseaseassociated pathologies (Fig. 5b). The relative abundance of peripheral Treg in lymph nodes
after 7 days of treatment was reduced (Fig. 5c), correlating with higher levels of
CD44highCD8+ lymphocytes in the draining lymph nodes (Fig. 5d) and relatively more
infiltrating CD8+ T cells in pancreatic lesions 14 days after treatment (Fig. 5e). These data
indicate that therapeutic targeting of p110δ can promote immune-mediated elimination of
cancer.

Concerns have been raised about inhibiting p110δ in cancer as this might impair CTLs and
negatively impact on cancer immune surveillance4,18. Our data show that although p110δ
blockade reduces the effectiveness of CTLs, it also overrides Treg- and probably also
MDSC-mediated suppression of anti-tumour immune responses, enabling even weakened
CTLs to successfully attack tumours. Thus, p110δ is apparently more essential for
regulatory rather than effector T cell responses against cancer cells. In addition, inhibition of
the PI3K pathway in CD8 T cells may help maintain them in a stem-cell like state19 with
enhanced potential for generating durable anti-tumour responses. Consistent with this
notion, δD910A mice resisted tumour rechallenge following surgical removal of the first
tumour. The p110δ inhibitor Idelalisib has shown impressive therapeutic impact in chronic
lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma1,2. In CLL, p110δ blockade
interferes with stroma-derived survival and adhesion signals supporting the tumour cells4,
but it is unclear if this fully explains the effectiveness of p110δ inhibition. Our finding that
p110δ inhibition can unlock adaptive anti-tumour responses provides a potential additional
mechanism for the efficacy of p110δ blockade in CLL, and add to the emerging rationale for
targeting PI3K in the tumour stroma4, to dampen inflammation (p110γ)20 and angiogenesis
(p110α)21.

Tumour-induced immune suppression constitutes an important barrier for effective antitumour immunity and immunotherapy in cancer. Our work suggests that p110δ inhibitors,
by disrupting the function of Treg and possibly of MDSCs, have the potential to shift the
balance from immune tolerance towards effective anti-tumour immunity. This provides a
rationale for p110δ inhibition both in solid and haematological cancer, possibly as an
adjuvant to cancer vaccines, adoptive cell therapy, or other strategies that promote tumourspecific immune responses.
