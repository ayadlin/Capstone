ABSTRACT
Voltage-gated Na+ channels (VGSCs) mediate action potential firing and regulate
adhesion and migration in excitable cells. VGSCs are also expressed in cancer cells.
In metastatic breast cancer (BCa) cells, the Nav1.5 α subunit potentiates migration
and invasion. In addition, the VGSC-inhibiting antiepileptic drug phenytoin inhibits
tumor growth and metastasis. However, the functional activity of Nav1.5 and its
specific contribution to tumor progression in vivo has not been delineated. Here, we
found that Nav1.5 is up-regulated at the protein level in BCa compared with matched
normal breast tissue. Na+ current, reversibly blocked by tetrodotoxin, was retained
in cancer cells in tumor tissue slices, thus directly confirming functional VGSC activity
in vivo. Stable down-regulation of Nav1.5 expression significantly reduced tumor
growth, local invasion into surrounding tissue, and metastasis to liver, lungs and
spleen in an orthotopic BCa model. Nav1.5 down-regulation had no effect on cell
proliferation or angiogenesis within the in tumors, but increased apoptosis. In vitro,
Nav1.5 down-regulation altered cell morphology and reduced CD44 expression,
suggesting that VGSC activity may regulate cellular invasion via the CD44-src-cortactin
signaling axis. We conclude that Nav1.5 is functionally active in cancer cells in breast
tumors, enhancing growth and metastatic dissemination. These findings support the
notion that compounds targeting Nav1.5 may be useful for reducing metastasis.

nervous system (CNS) development, regulating electrical
excitability, proliferation, fasciculation, neurite outgrowth,
pathfinding and migration [8]. In addition, the Nav1.5 α
subunit (gene, SCN5A) is highly expressed in the heart,
where it underlies the cardiac action potential, is required
for normal heart development, and is the target of a
number of antiarrhythmic drugs [9–11]. Thus, regulation
of tissue and organ development may be a general feature
of VGSCs, both in the CNS and the heart. Emerging
evidence suggests that VGSCs are also widely expressed
in cells traditionally considered to be non-excitable,
including astrocytes, fibroblasts, immune cells, microglia
and cancer cells [12].
Nav1.5 is expressed in metastatic triple-negative
(lacking estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and
HER2) MDA-MB-231 cells, where it enhances migration
and invasion through an extracellular matrix in vitro [13,
14]. Similar findings in cells from other cancer types
suggest that VGSC activity may be a general feature of

INTRODUCTION
Metastasis is the main cause of morbidity and
mortality from solid tumors, including breast cancers (BCa)
[1, 2]. Thus, there is a an urgent need to better understand
the mechanism(s) involved in metastasis in order to identify,
characterize and validate new molecular targets [3].
Various classes of ion channels, including voltagegated Na+ channels (VGSCs), play major roles in cancer
progression [4, 5]. VGSCs are heteromeric protein
complexes containing pore-forming α subunits (Nav1.1Nav1.9) and smaller, non-pore-forming β subunits (β1β4), which are also cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) [6].
VGSCs are classically responsible for the influx of Na+
underlying the action potential in electrically excitable
cells. VGSCs are therefore well-established clinical targets
for the treatment of a range of neurological disorders [7].
VGSC α and β subunits play a critical role during central

tumors [4, 15]. SCN5A mRNA is up-regulated in breast
tumors compared to normal breast tissue, and associates
with recurrence, metastasis and reduced survival [14, 16].
Interestingly, in BCa cells, Nav1.5 is predominantly
expressed in its neonatal D1:S3 splice form, and it is this
splice variant that is responsible for VGSC-dependent
invasion [14, 17]. Na+ current carried by Nav1.5 potentiates
invasion via regulation of the Na+/H+ exchanger, NHE1,
resulting in local extracellular acidification and activation
of pH-dependent cysteine cathepsins [18–20]. In addition,
Nav1.5 is a key regulator of an invasion-promoting gene
network in colorectal cancer cells [21]. The VGSC β1
subunit is also up-regulated in BCa, and increases tumor
growth and metastasis [22]. Thus, VGSC α and β subunits
may both play a role in cancer progression. We have found
that the VGSC-inhibiting Class Ib antiarrhythmic agent
and antiepileptic drug phenytoin significantly reduces Na+
current in MDA-MB-231 cells in vitro [16], and reduces
proliferation, tumor growth and metastasis in vivo [23].
However, the specific contributions of Nav1.5 to tumor
growth, invasion and metastasis in vivo have not been
previously investigated.
The purpose of the present study was to investigate
the specific involvement of Nav1.5 in BCa progression
in vivo. We show that Nav1.5 is up-regulated at the protein
level in human BCa samples compared with normal
breast tissue. In addition, using slice recording, we show
for the first time that Na+ currents exist in tumor tissue,
confirming that VGSCs are functionally active in acutely
prepared ex vivo tumor tissue preparations. Furthermore,
stable down-regulation of Nav1.5 using lentiviral shRNA
significantly reduces tumor growth, local invasion and
metastasis in vivo. We propose that Nav1.5 is functionally
active in breast tumors, enhancing both tumor growth
and metastasis. These findings suggest that Nav1.5 should
be further studied both as a potential biomarker and a
therapeutic target.

Supplementary Figure S1A–S1C). Importantly, Nav1.5
expression was significantly higher in tumor than in matched
surrounding non-cancer breast tissue (P < 0.001; Figure
1E). Interestingly, the proportion of cases with a recorded
lymph node metastasis was ~3-fold larger for tumors with
high Nav1.5 expression, than for those with low Nav1.5
expression, although this was not statistically significant (P
= 0.19; Supplementary Table S1). The Nav1.5 expression
level in the primary tumor did not correlate with age, ER
status, grade, menopausal status, or 5-year BCa-specific
survival (Supplementary Table S1). However, the Nav1.5
expression level strongly correlated with β1 expression in
adjacent sections from the same tumor samples (P < 0.001;
Figure 1Biii, 1D, 1F) [22]. Western blotting across a panel
of BCa cell lines and the non-cancer mammary epithelial
cell line MCF-10A revealed that Nav1.5 is highly expressed
in the strongly metastatic MDA-MB-231 cell line, but is
not detected in other, less invasive BCa or normal epithelial
cell lines (Figure 1G). This is consistent with previous
observations indicating that the neonatal splice variant of
Nav1.5 is absent from MCF-7 cells, but is present in MDAMB-231 cells [14]. Interestingly, in contrast to the tumor
specimens, Nav1.5 expression in these cell lines does not
match that of β1, which we showed previously to be most
highly expressed in MCF-7 cells [22, 24]. Together, these
data suggest that Nav1.5 is up-regulated in a subset of breast
tumors at the protein level and its expression may associate
with β1 in some tumors.

Na+ current is retained in tumors in vivo
Na+ current carried by VGSCs has been detected
by whole-cell patch clamp recording of cultured cell lines
from a number of different cancers [13, 14, 21, 25–29],
providing direct evidence for functional VGSC expression
in metastatic cancer cells in vitro. In addition, treatment
of prostate tumor-bearing rats with tetrodotoxin (TTX)
[30], and breast tumor-bearing mice with phenytoin [23]
or ranolazine [31] reduces metastasis, providing indirect
evidence for VGSC function in metastatic tumors in vivo.
However, to date, no group has directly studied functional
VGSC activity in tumor tissue. To address this gap, we
next used whole-cell patch clamping to record membrane
Na+ currents in tissue slices prepared from tumors 20–37
days after orthotopic implantation of MDA-MB-231
breast cancer cells (Figure 2A). We recorded from cells
located on the upper surface of tissue slices at various
distances from the edge of the tumor (Figure 2B). Tumor
cells displayed fast inward Na+ currents ex vivo that
were similar to currents detected in MDA-MB-231 cells
in vitro (39/60 cells recorded; Figure 2C–2E) [13, 14, 16,
17]. Importantly, TTX (30 μM) reversibly inhibited the
Na+ currents, thus confirming these as VGSC currents
(Figure 2F). We next compared the peak Na+ current density
of cells at the tumor periphery (≤1 mm from the lateral
surface of the tissue slice, with cells located deeper within

RESULTS
Nav1.5 is up-regulated in breast tumors
We have previously shown that SCN5A is upregulated at the mRNA level in breast tumors compared to
normal, non-cancer tissue [16]. A small qualitative study
(n = 10) revealed a similar up-regulation of expression of the
neonatal Nav1.5 splice variant at the protein level [14]. Here,
we studied the expression of Nav1.5 at the protein level in
human tissue samples by immunohistochemistry (IHC),
using an antibody that recognizes both adult and neonatal
splice variants [21]. Nav1.5 was expressed in the cytoplasm
and at the plasma membrane of normal epithelial and
carcinoma cells (Figure 1A, 1B). Antibody specificity was
confirmed in breast tumor tissue and rat heart tissue, where
Nav1.5 is highly expressed, by absence of staining following
pre-incubation with the immunizing peptide (Figure 1C and

the tumor (>1 mm and ≤1.5 mm from the tumor surface,
and >1.5 mm from the surface). We found that there was no
significant difference in peak Na+ current density between
cells across these regions (Figure 2G). Nor was there any
difference in membrane voltage, membrane capacitance,
or other Na+ current parameters (Table 1), suggesting that
functional VGSC expression is broadly similar between
tumor cells located in different regions of the tumor.
Finally, there was no relationship between peak Na+ current
density and tumor size, or stage at which the recordings
were taken following orthotopic implantation of the tumor
cells (Figure 2H, 2I). These findings demonstrate that Na+
current is retained on MDA-MB-231 cells in orthotopic
tumors in vivo, and expression is broadly similar in cells
in different tumor regions/sizes/stages. We postulated that
Nav1.5 may be responsible for this Na+ current in tumor
slices and may potentiate tumor progression in vivo, as it
does in vitro. We next tested these possibilities.

(Supplementary Figure S4B). Together, these findings
suggest that the relationship between Nav1.5 and cellular
invasion may be both steep [17] and threshold-dependent,
such that a minimum level of channel knock-down/inhibition
(e.g. ≥ 60% [14, 17, 18]) is required to elicit an effect on
invasion. Alternatively, lentiviral transduction of shRNA2
may have led to the selection of cancer cells in which invasion
is less dependent on Nav1.5. Given these possibilities, we
focused on the more effective shRNA1 for subsequent
in vivo analyses.

Nav1.5 down-regulation reduces tumor growth
and local invasion in vivo
We next investigated the specific effect of Nav1.5 on
tumor growth and invasion in vivo. Luciferase-expressing
MDA-MB-231 cells stably expressing non-targeting control
shRNA (“control cells”) or shRNA1 (“shRNA cells”) were
orthotopically implanted into the inguinal mammary fat
pads of female Rag2−/− Il2rg−/− mice and tumor growth
was monitored by non-invasive bioluminescent imaging.
Importantly, luciferase activity was very similar in
both control and shRNA cells (Supplementary Figure
S5A, S5B). Photon flux from shRNA tumors increased
more slowly than for control tumors, reaching statistical
significance after 4 weeks (P < 0.01; Figure 3E, 3F).
Concurrent monitoring of tumor growth by caliper
measurement revealed a similar relationship that became
statistically significant after 2 weeks, thus confirming the
bioluminescent data (P < 0.05; Figure 3G).
H&E staining revealed that both control and shRNA
tumors were broadly similar, and contained some local
invasion into surrounding tissue. Importantly, this invasion
was noticeably reduced in shRNA tumors compared to
control tumors (arrows, Figure 4A). The number of tumors
displaying invasion into surrounding tissues, including
fibroadipose tissue, muscle, mammary duct, and dermis,
was significantly lower in shRNA than control tumors (P
< 0.05; Figure 4B and Supplementary Figure S6A, S6B).
The in vitro invasiveness of shRNA cells was not further
reduced by TTX (30 μM), suggesting that the impaired
invasion of these cells was specifically due to the absence
of Nav1.5 activity (Figure 4C). Furthermore, the density
of cells expressing matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP9),
a marker correlating with invasive capacity in carcinomas
[23, 32], was also significantly reduced by 61% in shRNA
tumors compared to control tumors (P < 0.05; Figure 4D,
4E). The MMP9 immunoreactivity was generally adjacent
to human nuclear antigen (HNA)-positive cells, suggesting
that it is being expressed by tumor cells, rather than by
HNA-negative murine host stromal cells (Supplementary
Figure S7). Thus, Nav1.5 promotes tumor growth and local
invasion into surrounding tissue in vivo.
There was no difference in the density of Ki67+
dividing cells between control and shRNA tumors (Figure
5A, 5B). Similarly, there was no difference in the density

Stable down-regulation of Nav1.5 in MDAMB-231 cells
In order to study the specific involvement of Nav1.5
in tumor progression in vivo, we stably down-regulated its
expression in MDA-MB-231 cells using lentiviral shRNA.
We initially characterized four different shRNAs that each
targeted both the neonatal and adult splice variants of Nav1.5,
compared to a control non-targeting lentiviral shRNA. All
four shRNAs reduced the mRNA level of both Nav1.5
splice variants (Supplementary Figure S2A). ShRNA1 and
shRNA2 were the most effective, and following selection
of transduced clones, both shRNAs significantly reduced
the mRNA level of both Nav1.5 splice variants by ~65–80%
(P < 0.05; Supplementary Figure S2B). The β1 mRNA
level was also lower in shRNA1-transduced cells, although
this was not statistically significant (Supplementary Figure
S2C). Both shRNA1 and shRNA2 significantly reduced the
total cellular Nav1.5 protein level to a level sub-detectable
by western blot (Figure 3A).
Whole-cell patch clamp recording revealed that both
shRNA1 and shRNA2 significantly reduced Na+ currents
compared to control shRNA-expressing cells (Figure 3B–
3D). However, shRNA1 was considerably more effective,
reducing peak Na+ current density by 97% vs. 47% for
shRNA2 (P < 0.001 and P < 0.05, respectively; Figure 3C,
3D). Both shRNA1 and shRNA2 slightly but significantly
reduced in vitro proliferation by ~10% (P < 0.05;
Supplementary Figure S3A), although they had no effect on
apoptosis measured by in vitro TUNEL assay (Supplementary
Figure S3B). Both shRNA1 and shRNA2 moderately but
significantly reduced cellular migration measured using an
in vitro wound-healing assay by ~10% (P < 0.001 and P <
0.01, respectively; Supplementary Figure S4A). Interestingly,
shRNA1 significantly reduced in vitro invasion by 53%
(P < 0.001; Supplementary Figure S3B), consistent with
previous reports [13, 14, 17, 19], but shRNA2 had no effect

of CD31-expressing vascular structures between control
and shRNA tumors (Figure 5C, 5D). However, the density
of activated caspase 3+ apoptotic cells was significantly
increased by 2.7-fold in shRNA tumors compared to
control (P < 0.01; Figure 5E, 5F). The shRNA had no
effect on apoptosis in the same cells cultured in vitro
(Supplementary Figure S3B), suggesting that Nav1.5/Na+
current may regulate apoptosis in vivo, but not in vitro.
Interestingly, β1 over-expression also reduces the density
of apoptotic cells in orthotopic tumors [22]. Thus, both
Nav1.5 and β1 may increase tumor growth by reducing
apoptosis.

that luciferase expression was retained on the tumor cells at
metastatic sites (Supplementary Figure S8). The density of
luciferase-expressing tumor cells was significantly reduced
in the liver, lungs and spleen of mice bearing shRNA tumors
by ~60% compared to mice bearing control tumors (P <
0.001; Figure 6E, 6G, 6I). Thus, Nav1.5 promotes metastasis
to the liver, lungs and spleen in this orthotopic tumor model.

Nav1.5 down-regulation alters cellular morphology
and reduces CD44 expression without affecting the
epithelial-mesenchymal transition
β1 regulates protrusion of processes from the
cell body of BCa cells via a trans-homophilic adhesion
mechanism that requires fyn kinase and Na+ current,
replicating its role in regulating neurite outgrowth in
the CNS [22]. Similarly, Na+ current carried by Nav1.5
promotes pro-invasive, elongate morphology in MDAMB-231 cells cultured on Matrigel [19, 31]. Thus, VGSC
activity may represent a general mechanism by which BCa
cells acquire an elongate, mesenchymal-like morphology.
Here, we found that down-regulation of Nav1.5 expression
with shRNA resulted in an increase in circularity of
cultured MDA-MB-231 cells, i.e. a reduction in elongate
morphology in favor of a more rounded epithelial-like
phenotype (P < 0.001; Figure 7A, 7B). The reversion
to a more epithelial-like morphology induced by Nav1.5
down-regulation did not associate with any alteration
in E-cadherin, N-cadherin, vimentin, slug or snail
expression, suggesting that Nav1.5 does not regulate the
expression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)
markers (Figure 7C–7G). However, the protein level of
CD44, which promotes invasion and metastasis of BCa
cells [33], was noticeably reduced in MDA-MB-231 cells
expressing shRNA (P < 0.05 Figure 7H, 7I). Thus, Nav1.5
may promote invasion and metastasis, at least in part, by
inducing morphological changes via modulating CD44
expression.

Nav1.5 down-regulation inhibits metastasis
We have previously shown that phenytoin reduces
metastasis of orthotopically implanted MDA-MB-231
cells to the liver, lungs and spleen [23]. Similarly, Nav1.5
inhibition by ranolazine has recently been shown to inhibit
lung colonization by tail vein-injected MDA-MB-231
cells in an experimental metastasis model [31]. Thus,
pharmacological inhibition of Nav1.5 may be an effective
tool to reduce metastatic dissemination. However, the
specific effect of Nav1.5 on metastasis of orthotopically
implanted tumors has not been investigated. Here, we
monitored metastasis by bioluminescent imaging following
post mortem resection of orthotopically implanted control
and shRNA-expressing MDA-MB-231 cells (Figure 6A).
We found that photon flux was significantly reduced in
mice bearing shRNA tumors compared to mice bearing
control tumors, and in the liver, lungs and spleen measured
ex vivo (P < 0.001 for both; Figure 6B, 6C). We next
studied metastasis to these organs at the cellular level in
tissue sections. We detected isolated luciferase-expressing
tumor cells in sections within all three organs, and also
in much larger multicellular foci in the lungs Figure 6D,
6F, 6H). Luciferase expression co-localized with HNA,
which is absent in recipient mouse cells, thus confirming

DISCUSSION

In BCa cells, the predominant α subunit, Nav1.5, is
expressed mainly in its neonatal splice form [14]. A small
study of patient tissue specimens revealed that the neonatal
splice variant of Nav1.5 is up-regulated in BCa compared
to non-cancer breast tissue [14]. Here, in a quantitative
study using a larger patient cohort, we found that Nav1.5
was significantly up-regulated in breast tumors compared
with matched non-cancer breast tissue. The commercially
available antibody used here recognizes both the adult and
neonatal splice Nav1.5 variants, suggesting that although

Increasing evidence suggests that VGSCs are
expressed in cells from a range of types of cancer,
including BCa [13, 14], cervical cancer [34, 35],
colorectal cancer [21], lung cancer [25, 36], lymphoma
[37], melanoma [38], mesothelioma [39], neuroblastoma
[40], ovarian cancer [41] and prostate cancer [29]. VGSC
β subunits have also been reported in BCa, non-small
cell lung cancer and prostate cancer [22, 24, 25, 42, 43].

the neonatal splice variant is predominant [14], splice
variant specificity is not required to reliably evaluate
Nav1.5 expression in tumors in vivo. Interestingly, this
antibody has also been also used to demonstrate upregulation of Nav1.5 expression in colorectal tumor
specimens [21]. At the mRNA level, SCN5A expression
has been shown to correlate with metastasis, recurrence
and reduced overall survival in BCa patients [14, 16].
However, there was no correlation between Nav1.5 protein
expression and other histopathological characteristics in
this cohort, although there was a moderate trend towards
higher Nav1.5 expression in node-positive patients. In
conclusion, our data add support to the notion that Nav1.5
is up-regulated in BCa and suggest that further, larger
scale studies are warranted to explore the relationship
between Nav1.5 expression and other tumor parameters,
including lymph node metastasis.
Na+ currents have been recorded from a number of
metastatic cancer cell lines and cancer cells isolated from
tumor biopsies in vitro using whole-cell patch clamp
recording, suggesting that VGSCs may be functionally
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

active in tumors [4, 34, 35]. In addition, pharmacological
and siRNA studies have shown that Nav1.5 expression
in metastatic MDA-MB-231 cells promotes several
cellular behaviors associated with metastasis, including
migration, galvanotaxis, detachment from substrates,
and invasion [13, 14, 17, 44]. Similar results have been
reported in cells from other tumor types, suggesting that
contribution of VGSCs to migration/invasion of cancer
cells may be a general phenomenon [4]. However,
evidence supporting the specific involvement of Nav1.5
in tumor progression in vivo is limited. Using tissue
slice recording, we found that functional Na+ currents
were retained in orthotopic tumors. Interestingly, the
Na+ current density was broadly similar in cells at the
tumor periphery compared to those deeper into the tumor
slice, suggesting that Nav1.5 expression may be fairly
uniform within tumors, rather than being up-regulated
at the invasive edge. These data provide the first direct
in vivo evidence confirming functional VGSC activity/
Na+ current in BCa cells tumors in situ, and suggest
that Nav1.5 expression detected by IHC in patient

which promotes tumor growth in vivo, but not in vitro,
highlighting the importance of studying VGSC expression/
activity in situ [22].
Our data suggest that Nav1.5 promotes local invasion
and metastatic dissemination to the liver, lungs and spleen
in vivo. This finding broadly agrees with a recent study,
using an experimental metastasis model, in which Nav1.5
down-regulation reduced lung colonization of tail veininjected MDA-MB-231 cells [31]. Together, these findings
suggest that Nav1.5 may promote both tumor growth and
metastasis in BCa. The mechanism(s) by which VGSCs
may promote tumor progression appear complex, and are
reviewed in detail elsewhere [4, 45]. The prevailing model
suggests that in MDA-MB-231 cells, Na+ current carried
by Nav1.5 allosterically regulates NHE1 to increase H+
efflux, thus enhancing the activity of pH-dependent cysteine
cathepsin proteases [18, 20]. In addition, Nav1.5 expression
increases src tyrosine kinase activity and cortactin
phosphorylation to enhance invadopodia formation and
acquisition of an elongate invasive morphology [19].
Further complexity is added by the β1 subunit, which also
promotes an invasive elongate cellular morphology, in part

specimens may represent, at least in part, functional
channels. Thus, we propose that Nav1.5 should be further
investigated as a potential biomarker in BCa, and in vivo
electrophysiological analysis may add value to traditional
IHC/PCR approaches to studying biomarker expression.
We found that stable down-regulation of Nav1.5
with shRNA reduced tumor growth in vivo. In addition,
shRNA slightly reduced proliferation in vitro, although
Ki67 expression was unchanged in vivo, suggesting that
proliferation was not significantly altered in the tumors.
In contrast, shRNA had no effect on apoptosis in vitro, but
significantly increased density of apoptotic cells within the
tumors. Interestingly, transient inhibition of Nav1.5 with
TTX or phenytoin does not affect proliferation in vitro,
although the effect on apoptosis has not been previously
investigated [13, 14, 16]. Thus, the effect of Nav1.5 on
proliferation and apoptosis appears to be both subtle
and complex, and may be dependent on cellular context.
For example, heterotypic interaction with, and support
from the tumor microenvironment may be important for
regulating Nav1.5-dependent tumor growth. Interestingly,
we previously reported a similar situation for β1,

via a trans-homophilic adhesion interaction that requires fyn
kinase [22]. Interestingly, β1-mediated process outgrowth
also requires Na+ current, suggesting that Nav1.5 and β1
may function co-operatively in promoting invasion and
metastasis. Our data here add to this model by suggesting
that Nav1.5 expression does not enhance invasive elongate
cellular morphology by altering the EMT, but may directly/
indirectly influence expression of the metastasis-promoting
CAM, CD44 (Figure 8) [33, 46]. Adhesion of CD44 to its
ligand hyaluronan results in src activation and cortactin
phosphorylation [47–49]. Thus, Nav1.5 may either directly/
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

indirectly regulate this signaling cascade, or regulate
cortactin phosphorylation through a parallel pathway.
In conclusion, our data suggest that Nav1.5 is upregulated in BCa and promotes both tumor growth and
metastasis. Thus, VGSC α and β subunits may be general
mediators of an invasive phenotype in tumor cells. Given that
pharmacological targeting of VGSCs inhibits tumor growth
and metastasis in vivo [23, 30, 31], these findings suggest
that Nav1.5 expression and/or Na+ current may be a useful
biomarker for cancer progression, and VGSC inhibition may
be a novel therapeutic strategy to reduce metastasis.

Figure 8: A model for Nav1.5 involvement in tumor progression. Na+ influx carried by Nav1.5 allosterically regulates NHE1

to increase H+ efflux, lowering extracellular pH and enhancing cathepsin protease activity [18, 20]. Nav1.5 also increases src activity and
cortactin phosphorylation, resulting in cytoskeletal changes, invadopodia formation and acquisition of an elongate invasive morphology
[19]. The β1 subunit enhances process outgrowth via a trans-homophilic adhesion mechanism that requires fyn kinase and Na+ current
[22]. Nav1.5 positively regulates CD44 protein expression, which may in turn enhance CD44-mediated src activation and increase cortactin
expression/activity [47–49]. Nav1.5 expression is maintained by a positive feedback mechanism via protein kinase A (PKA) [26, 57].

BCa and matched non-cancer breast tissue was available
for 36 cases. Patients provided consent to the Breast
32925

Oncotarget

Cancer Now Tissue Bank for their tissues to be used
for research. Dataset and sample characteristics were
described previously [22]. Immunohistochemistry was
performed using the EnVision+ System-HRP kit (Dako)
and anti-Nav1.5 antibody (1:100; Alomone) [21, 22].
Antibody specificity was confirmed by preadsorption to
immunizing peptide (4:1 ratio peptide:antibody; Alomone)
for 1 h prior to application. Rat heart tissue (Abcam)
was used as a positive control for Nav1.5 staining in
a separate experiment (Supplementary Figure S1). β1
immunohistochemistry was performed previously [22].
Slides were scanned at 40X using an Aperio ScanScope.
Nav1.5 immunoreactivity in the tumor samples was scored
independently by two investigators (WJB and RMS, a
breast histopathologist) using the Allred method [22,
51]. The proportion of Nav1.5-expressing cells in a given
section was given a score (none: 0; < 1/100: 1; 1/100 to
1/10: 2; 1/10 to 1/3: 3; 1/3 to 2/3: 4; >2/3: 5), followed
by an estimate of staining intensity (none: 0; weak: 1;
intermediate: 2; strong: 3), and then the proportion and
intensity scores were summed to give an overall score of
0–8. A score ≤ 5 was considered “low” and > 5 was “high.”
Scoring was performed blinded to outcome data.

[22]. Tumors and organ sites of metastasis were fixed in
4% paraformaldehyde and frozen [52].

Tumor slice preparation for electrophysiology
For electrophysiological slice recording, a total of 18
animals were used across 6 independent cages. Following
euthanasia (20–37 days following implantation of cancer
cells), tumors were dissected and quickly placed into
ice-cold physiological saline solution (PSS) containing
(in mM): 144 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 2.5 CaCl2, 5.6
D-glucose and 5 HEPES, (pH 7.2). The tumor was cut to
~5 × 5 mm with a razor and fixed with cyanoacrylate glue
onto the pre-chilled pedestal of an oscillating tissue slicer
(Campden Instruments). The tissue block was immersed in
ice-cold PSS and sliced at 250 μm. Slices were maintained
in a homemade tissue holding chamber containing PSS for
> 20 min at room temperature (21°C) prior to recording.
In all cases, recordings were taken from cells in (1) the
periphery (≤1 mm from tumor surface, (2) the intermediate
zone (>1 mm and ≤ 1.5 mm from surface), and (3) the
center (>1.5 mm from surface).

Electrophysiology

Western blotting

The whole-cell patch clamp technique was used
to record plasma membrane Na+ currents, from cells in
slices, or cells grown on glass coverslips [16, 24]. The
extracellular recording solution contained (in mM): 144
NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 2.5 CaCl2, 5.6 D-glucose and 5
HEPES (pH 7.2), and the intracellular recording solution
contained (in mM): 5 NaCl, 145 KCl, 2 MgCl2, 1 CaCl2,
10 HEPES, 11 EGTA, (pH 7.4) [26]. Voltage clamp
recordings were made using a Multiclamp 700B amplifier
(Molecular Devices) compensating for series resistance
by 40–60%. Currents were digitized using a Digidata
1440A interface (Molecular Devices), low-pass filtered at
10 kHz, sampled at 50 kHz and analyzed using pCLAMP
10.4 software (Molecular Devices). Leak current was
subtracted using a P/6 protocol [53].

SDS-PAGE was performed as described [22]. The
following antibodies were used: rabbit anti-Nav1.5 (1:1000;
Cell Signaling Technology); rabbit anti-E-cadherin (1:1000;
Cell Signaling Technology); rabbit anti-N-cadherin (1:1000;
Cell Signaling Technology); rabbit anti-vimentin (1:1000;
Cell Signaling Technology); rabbit anti-Slug (1:1000; Cell
Signaling Technology); rabbit anti-Snail (1:1000; Cell
Signaling Technology); mouse anti-CD44 (1:1000; AbD
Serotec); rabbit anti-heat shock protein 90 (HSP90; 1:1000;
Cell Signaling Technology), and mouse anti-α-tubulin
(1:10,000; Sigma).

Orthotopic breast tumor model
All animal procedures were performed after approval
by the University of York Animal Welfare and Ethical
Review Body and under authority of a UK Home Office
Project License. Six week-old female Rag2−/− Il2rg−/− mice
were obtained from the Yorkshire Cancer Research Unit,
University of York, (3–5 per specific pathogen free cage).
1 × 106 MDA-MB-231 cells suspended in Matrigel (20%
v/v in saline) were injected into the left inguinal mammary
fat pad of each animal whilst under isoflurane anesthesia.
For tumor growth and metastasis assays, a total of 29 mice
were used across 7 independent replicated experiments.
Tumor growth was monitored weekly by bioluminescence
imaging [22]. Animal weight and the length and width
of each tumor (in mm) were measured every 2–4 days.
Tumor volume was calculated as 0.5 × (length × width2).
Mice were euthanized 4 weeks following implantation of
tumor cells and metastatic bioluminescence was measured
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Immunohistochemistry and immunocytochemistry
H&E staining was performed as described [22].
The following primary antibodies were used for IHC and
immunocytochemistry (ICC) [22]: rabbit anti-MMP9
(1:5000; Abcam); rabbit anti-Ki67 (1:5000; Abcam);
rabbit anti-activated caspase-3 (1:200; R&D Systems);
rabbit anti-CD31 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); mouse
anti-CD44 (1:100; AbD Serotec); mouse anti-HNA
(1:100; Millipore). Secondary antibodies were Alexa-568conjugated goat anti mouse/rabbit, unless stated otherwise
(1:500; Invitrogen). Tyramide signal amplification was
used for MMP9 [54]. Samples were mounted in Prolong
Gold with DAPI (Invitrogen). H&E and fluorescentstained tissue sections were scanned independently
at 20X using a Zeiss AxioScan.Z1 slide scanner.

Oncotarget

Stained cultured cells were viewed on a Zeiss Axio
Observer.Z1 microscope with LSM 710 confocal
laser scanner. Images were exported into ImageJ for
processing. Brightness/contrast was adjusted using the
ImageJ “Auto” function. Density of MMP9+, Ki67+
or activated caspase-3+ cells, tumor vascularity and
metastasis to liver/lungs/spleen were measured across
scanned images of whole sections (3 sections per animal),
blinded to treatment [22]. For ICC, confocal Z-series
projections were flattened using the maximum signal
and circularity ([4π.Area]/[Perimeter2]) was computed
for individual cells using ImageJ. For a perfect circle,
circularity = 1, and for an increasingly elongated shape,
circularity approaches 0 [55].
