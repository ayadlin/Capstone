ABSTRACT
Leptin, a major adipocytokine produced by adipocytes, is emerging as a key
molecule linking obesity with breast cancer therefore, it is important to find effective
strategies to antagonize oncogenic effects of leptin to disrupt obesity-cancer axis.
Here, we examine the potential of honokiol (HNK), a bioactive polyphenol from
Magnolia grandiflora, as a leptin-antagonist and systematically elucidate the underlying
mechanisms. HNK inhibits leptin-induced epithelial-mesenchymal-transition (EMT),
and mammosphere-formation along with a reduction in the expression of stemness
factors, Oct4 and Nanog. Investigating the downstream mediator(s), that direct
leptin-antagonist actions of HNK; we discovered functional interactions between HNK,
LKB1 and miR-34a. HNK increases the expression and cytoplasmic-localization of
LKB1 while HNK-induced SIRT1/3 accentuates the cytoplasmic-localization of LKB1.
We found that HNK increases miR-34a in LKB1-dependent manner as LKB1-silencing
impedes HNK-induced miR-34a which can be rescued by LKB1-overexpression. Finally,
an integral role of miR-34a is discovered as miR-34a mimic potentiates HNK-mediated
inhibition of EMT, Zeb1 expression and nuclear-localization, mammosphere-formation,
and expression of stemness factors. Leptin-antagonist actions of HNK are further
enhanced by miR-34a mimic whereas miR-34a inhibitor results in inhibiting HNK’s
effect on leptin. These data provide evidence for the leptin-antagonist potential of
HNK and reveal the involvement of LKB1 and miR-34a.

(increase in cell number), leading to dysregulation of local
and systemic secretion of biologically active polypeptides,
adipocytokines such as leptin [3]. In recent years, leptin
has emerged as a key candidate molecule mediating the
molecular effects of obesity on cancer [4, 5]. Various
epidemiological studies have shown that high level of
plasma leptin is linked with increased risk and poor
prognosis for breast carcinogenesis [6, 7]. Analysis of
clinical samples showed overexpression of leptin receptor
in 83% of breast tumor samples whereas no expression

INTRODUCTION
Given that one-third of all cancers are attributed
to obese state, obesity is a well-established risk factor.
Obese state is not only associated with aggressive tumor
progression, poorer prognosis, increased recurrence and
poorer survival of obese breast cancer patients, but it
also impacts tumor initiation [1, 2]. Adipocytes lose their
normal physiological size heterogeneity in obese state and
undergo hypertrophy (increase in cell size) and hyperplasia

of leptin receptor was observed in normal mammary
epithelial cells [8, 9]. Also, leptin overexpression was
observed in 92% of breast tumors examined but in none
of the cases of normal breast epithelium. Overexpression
of leptin and leptin receptor in breast tumors and its
association with tumor aggressiveness suggest that leptin
can also influence breast tumor growth and progression via
an autocrine pathway [9, 10].
Various research groups have been studying the
oncogenic role of leptin in cancer. Studies from our
lab and others have established that high leptin levels
(hyperleptinemia) associated with obese state stimulate
breast cancer cell proliferation, invasion, migration, and
angiogenesis, thereby promoting breast tumor growth
and metastasis [11–17]. Leptin also plays a central role
in the acquisition of mesenchymal characteristics by
inducing breast cancer cells to undergo a transition from
epithelial to spindle-like mesenchymal morphology [13].
Leptin has been reported to regulate many signaling
pathways and transcription factors implicated in breast
cancer stem cells (BCSCs). Intact leptin-leptin receptor
signaling was found to play an integral role in the
survival of CSC population [18]. It is shown that leptin
receptor is a characteristic feature of Tumor initiating
stem cells (TISCs) and participates in the regulation of
core pluripotency-associated transcription factors, Oct4
and Nanog [19, 20]. These studies indicate that leptin not
only plays a significant role in promoting the growth and
metastatic progression of established breast tumors but
also augments tumor initiation and recurrence.
Leptin and leptin-signaling pathway have emerged
as leading targets for disrupting obesity-breast cancer link;
therefore, developing effective, non-endocrine, non-toxic
agents for the inhibition of neoplastic effects of leptin
is highly important. Current strategies to inhibit leptin
pathway such as soluble Leptin receptors (LRs), synthetic
leptin-antagonists, and anti-LR monoclonal antibodies
(anti-LR mAbs) [17] are limited by associated toxicities
as well as low efficacy. Recently, active constitutive agents
in natural products used in traditional Asian medicine
have shown efficacy as potential cancer preventive as
well as therapeutic agents [21, 22]. For years, cones,
bark and leaves from Magnolia plant species have been
used for their anti-thrombocytic, anti-inflammatory,
anxiolytic, anti-depressant, antioxidant, antispasmodic,
and antibacterial effects [23–26]. It is now known that
Honokiol (HNK), a natural phenolic compound isolated
from an extract of seed cones from Magnolia grandiflora
[27] is responsible for these medicinal benefits of
Magnolia species. Previous studies from our lab have
shown that HNK inhibits breast carcinogenesis in vitro and
in vivo [28, 29] thereby establishing HNK as a promising
bioactive compound against breast carcinogenesis. We also
found that honokiol treatment increases the expression of
tumor suppressor LKB1 which plays an integral role in

honokiol-mediated inhibition of breast tumor growth and
progression [28]. Recently, we discovered the involvement
of miR-34a in breast tumor inhibition function of
honokiol. Honokiol treatment inhibited breast tumor
growth in lean and obese-hyperleptinemic mice models
in a manner associated with activation of miR-34a [30].
In this report, we specifically investigated the potential
of HNK to inhibit leptin-induced epithelial-mesenchymal
transition (EMT) and tumorsphere formation and examine
the underlying molecular mechanisms. We provide
molecular evidence supporting the regulatory role of
LKB1, and integral involvement of miR-34a in leptinantagonist potential of HNK.

RESULTS
Honokiol inhibits leptin-induced epithelialmesenchymal transition, mammosphere
formation, and migration of breast cancer cells
Epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) of
cancer cells is a crucial early event leading to induction
of cell motility, invasion and distant metastasis. We
recently presented a pivotal role of leptin in acquisition
of mesenchymal characteristics and aggressive behavior
in breast cancer cells [13]. Here, we specifically examined
if HNK could inhibit the stimulatory effect of leptin on
EMT and metastatic properties of breast cancer cells.
Following treatment with leptin and HNK, we observed
striking morphological differences between MCF7 cells
treated with different combinations. Leptin-treated MCF7
cells exhibited acquisition of fibroblast-like appearance
and increased formation of pseudopodia observed
emanating from the cell membrane. These features
signify typical mesenchymal phenotype rather than the
normal epithelial phenotype of MCF7 cells, showing that
cells have undergone EMT upon leptin treatment. HNK
prevented the morphological transition from an epitheliallike to mesenchymal-like appearance caused by leptin
treatment. HNK alone did not affect the morphology of
MCF7 cells (Figure 1A). To unequivocally establish that
HNK blocks leptin-induced EMT, we next examined
the biochemical hallmarks of EMT-reversal including
gain of expression of epithelial markers (occludin, and
cytokeratin-18 (CK-18) with a concomitant decrease
in mesenchymal markers (fibronectin, and vimentin)
expression. Leptin treatment resulted in upregulation
of mesenchymal markers accompanied with a marked
decrease in the expression of epithelial markers. HNK
blocked leptin-induced modulation of mesenchymal
and epithelial markers leading to decreased expression
of fibronectin and vimentin and increased expression of
CK-18 and occludin (Figure 1B and 1C, Supplementary
Figure 1A). Immunocytochemical analysis provided
additional evidence to support HNK-mediated leptin-

induced EMT reversal showing gain of expression of
occluding and E-cadherin (Figure 1E). Transcriptional
repressors for epithelial marker proteins, Zeb1/2 and snail,
are frequently detected in metastatic cancer cells and are
known to be involved in EMT [31, 32]. We also examined
the involvement of these transcription repressors in HNKmediated inhibition of leptin-induced EMT. Indeed, leptin
treatment not only increased the expression of snail, Zeb1
and Zeb2 but also increased the nuclear translocation of
Zeb1 (Figure 1B, 1C and 1D). Importantly, HNK treatment
inhibited leptin-induced expression of snail, Zeb1 and
Zeb2 as well as promoted cytoplasmic retention of Zeb1

even in the presence of leptin (Figure 1B, and 1D). In
a recent study, we showed that HNK administration
retarded leptin-induced growth of MDA-MB-231 cells
implanted in female athymic mice [30]. We used tumor
samples from the same study to evaluate the effect of
HNK on leptin-induced mesenchymal markers by RTPCR analysis. Corroborating in vitro findings, tumors from
mice co-treated with HNK and leptin showed decreased
levels of expression of vimentin, fibronectin, Zeb1/2
and slug in comparison to tumors from leptin-treated
mice (Figure 1F). Since HNK inhibited leptin-induced
EMT, we aimed to examine whether HNK treatment also

blocked induction of migration usually observed in the
presence of leptin. Significant migration of MCF7, MDAMB-468, MDA-MB-231, SUM149, SUM159 and T47D
breast cancer cells observed in the presence of leptin was
inhibited in the presence of HNK treatment (Figure 1G,
Supplementary Figure 1B, 1C). Honokiol treatment does
not affect growth of MCF10A cells while leptin show
only modest effects on MCF10A cells (Supplementary
Figure 2).
An emerging hypothesis is that EMT bestows cells
with stem-like characteristics and facilitates an increase
in the subpopulation of CSC (cancer stem cells) [33–35].
Utilizing mammosphere assay that relies on the unique
property of breast cancer cells with stem-like potential to
form large, round, unattached floating spheroid colonies
(termed mammosphere), we showed that leptin induced
mammosphere formation. HNK treatment efficiently
inhibits leptin-induced EMT as well as migration of
breast cancer cells, therefore, we hypothesize that HNK
may also inhibit leptin-induced mammosphere formation.
Indeed, HNK inhibited mammosphere formation even in
the presence of leptin (Figure 2A). Given the association
of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) markers, Nanog
and Oct4 with self-renewal and maintenance of stem cell
fate, we wished to investigate whether iPSC markers are
affected by leptin treatment. To this end, we assessed the
expression of Oct4, and Nanog in leptin-treated breast
cancer cells and found that the expression of pluripotency
genes was higher in leptin-treated cells (Figure 2B–2D)
with respect to the expression in untreated cells. Cells
treated with HNK exhibited reduced levels of iPSC
markers and interestingly, HNK treatment resulted in the
inhibition of leptin-induced expression of Oct4 and Nanog
(Figure 2B–2D). Breast cancer cells treated with leptin and
honokiol were examined for the expression of Cyclin D1
as a functional control (Supplemental Figure 3). Together,
these results show that HNK treatment results in effective
inhibition of leptin-induced epithelial-mesenchymal
transition, mammosphere formation, stemness and
migration of breast cancer cells.

regulating its activity, we examined the phosphorylation
and expression of AMPK. Honokiol-treatment increased
phosphorylation and expression of AMPK (Figure 3A).
Tumor-suppressor function of LKB1 is majorly attributed
to the cytoplasmic pool of LKB1 as mutant LKB1 lacking
the nuclear localization signal still retains the ability to
suppress cell growth [38, 39]. Examining nuclear and
cytoplasmic fractions of breast cancer cells treated
with HNK, we found that HNK induced cytoplasmic
localization of LKB1 (Figure 3B). Recent studies have
reported an important role of Sirtuin-deacetylases,
SIRT1 and SIRT3 in LKB1 regulation. SIRT1 and SIRT3
overexpression diminishes lysine acetylation of LKB1
and concurrently increases its activity and cytoplasmic/
nuclear ratio [40, 41]. We found that breast cancer cells
treated with HNK exhibited an increase in the expression
of SIRT1 and SIRT3 within 30 minutes post-treatment
(Figure 3C). To examine the effect of SIRT1 and SIRT3
on HNK-mediated cytoplasmic localization of LKB1, we
overexpressed SIRT1 and SIRT3 in MCF7 cells followed
by HNK treatment. Immunofluorescence analysis showed
that LKB1 is present both in nucleus and cytoplasm in
untreated cells. Corroborating immunoblot analyses
shown in figure 3B, HNK-treated cells exhibited increased
cytoplasmic localization of LKB1 in comparison to
untreated cells which was further enhanced with SIRT1
and SIRT3 overexpression (Figure 3D, 3F)). Our studies
show a role of sirtuin-deacetylases in HNK-mediated
functional upregulation of LKB1.

Honokiol upregulates miR-34a in a
LKB1-dependent manner
Regulatory role of microRNAs (miRNA) in various
biological and pathological processes, including cancer
progression and metastasis has been well-recognized in
recent years. Functionally, miRs are small (~21-mer)
regulatory RNA molecules that exert their regulatory
effects by binding to the 3′-untranslated regions (3′-UTR)
of specific mRNAs triggering mRNA degradation or
translational repression [42]. miRNAs have been known to
function both as oncogenes, potentiating cancer progression
and metastasis, and tumor suppressors implicated in
growth inhibition [43]. One of the important tumor
suppressor miRNA involved in breast cancer is miR-34a,
which is downregulated in aggressive breast tumors [44].
Breast cancer cells treated with HNK exhibited a timedependent increase in miR-34a expression (Figure 4A).
Interestingly, leptin treatment decreased the expression of
miR-34a in MCF7, SKBR3 and SUM149 breast cancer
cells (Figure 4B). We raised the question whether LKB1
plays any role in honokiol-mediated increase of miR-34a.
We used LKB1shRNA lentivirus and puromycin to select
for stable pools of MCF7 cells with LKB1 depletion.
pLKO.1 and LKB1shRNA stable MCF7 cell pools were

Honokiol induces expression and cytoplasmic
localization of tumor suppressor Liver Kinase B1
in breast cancer cells
Liver kinase B1 (LKB1), owing to its dual role as a
tumor suppressor and an upstream master kinase, serves as
a major hub regulating several downstream pathways and
known tumor suppressors (e.g., AMPK-mTOR, JNK and
p53) [36, 37]. We found that HNK increases expression
of LKB1 in breast cancer cells (Figure 3A). Interestingly,
leptin treatment inhibits LKB1 expression whereas
HNK treatment increases LKB1 expression even in the
presence of leptin (Figure 3E). Since LKB1 has recently
been identified as a critical upstream kinase for AMPK

in HNK-mediated inhibition of iPSC factors, we treated
breast cancer cells with HNK in the presence of miR34a
mimic or inhibitior. As expected, HNK inhibited the
expression of Oct4, Nanog and Sox2 in breast cancer cells
which is further decreased by ectopic miR-34a expression
(Figure 5E, 5F).
Given our results showing that miR-34a plays an
important role in HNK-mediated modulation of EMT
markers and iPSC factors, we decided to examine whether
miR-34a modulation also affects HNK-mediated inhibition
of oncogenic actions of leptin. Expression of miR-34a
mimic potentiated HNK-mediated-inhibition of leptininduced clonogenicity, migration and mammosphere
formation. On the other hand, miR-34a inhibitor interfered
with HNK efficacy as a leptin-antagonist resulting in poor
inhibition of leptin-induced clonogenicity, migration and
mammosphere formation (Figure 6A, 6B, 6C). Leptin
treatment decreases miR-34a expression (Figure 4B),
therefore, it is interesting to note that miR-34a mimic
reduced oncogenic effects of leptin while miR-34a
inhibitor increased leptin’s impact (Figure 6A, 6B, 6C).
Together, these data provide evidence supporting an
important role of miR-34a in HNK-mediated inhibition of
oncogenic actions of leptin.
Collectively, the findings presented here suggest
that HNK inhibits leptin-induced EMT, stemness and
mammosphere formation, and provide evidence for the
involvement of miR-34a as a regulator of HNK-mediated
inhibition of oncogenic actions of leptin, and uncover a
novel mechanism of HNK action through activation of
miR-34a in a LKB1-dependent manner (Figure 7).

our interest in investigating the efficacy of HNK as a
novel inhibitor of leptin-induced EMT and stemness in
breast cancer. We found that HNK effectively inhibits
leptin-induced EMT of breast cancer cells as evident
from morphological changes and molecular alterations
of mesenchymal and epithelial genes. Breast tumors
treated with HNK also showed reduced expression of
mesenchymal markers even in the presence of leptin
treatment providing in vivo evidence. Mammosphere
formation induced by leptin was also efficiently abrogated
with HNK treatment along with inhibition of expression
of iPSC factors (Oct4, nanog and Sox2). These findings
imparted convincing evidence supporting the efficacy
of HNK as a novel inhibitor of leptin-induced EMT and
stemness warranting further mechanistic investigations.
Consequently, we designed further studies to decipher
the key nodes of leptin-antagonist function of HNK
to facilitate establishing surrogate biomarkers for its
efficacy and help in clinical development of this bioactive
molecule as a leptin-antagonist. We found that HNK
induces expression and cytoplasmic localization of LKB1.
HNK also increases expression of Sirtuin-deacetylases,
SIRT1/3 and overexpression of both SIRT1 and SIRT3
further increases cytoplasmic localization of LKB1. HNK
upregulates miR-34a in a LKB1-dependent manner;
miR-34 a plays an important role in HNK-mediated
inhibition of EMT, stemness and leptin-function.
Tumor suppressor LKB1, a key determinant in
Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, has been found to be inactivated
in a subset of sporadic lung and pancreatic cancer
[37, 45]. LKB1 inactivation is not commonly correlated
with human breast carcinoma but interestingly, LKB1
loss has been observed in high-grade DCIS and highgrade invasive ductal carcinoma [46]. Importantly, LKB1
expression was abrogated only in the DCIS associated
with invasion but not in pure DCIS cases indicating that
LKB1 loss might promote invasive behavior. In fact,
low LKB1 protein levels correlate with poor prognosis
in breast carcinoma [47]. LKB1 knockdown increases
motility and invasiveness of cancer cells, and induces
the expression of many mesenchymal marker proteins
indicating its possible role in EMT [48, 49]. We show
that HNK increases the expression of LKB1 in breast
cancer cells. Owing to its N-terminal nuclear localization
signal, LKB1 is predominantly located in nucleus
especially when it is not associated with other proteins.
Upon activation, LKB1 translocates to cytoplasm where
it complexes with STRAD (STE-related adapter) and
MO25 (mouse protein 25). SIRT1 and SIRT3 have been
shown to deacetylate LKB1 leading to an increase in its
cytoplasmic localization, binding with STRAD and MO25
and activation of kinase function [40, 41]. We show that
HNK increases the expression of SIRT1 and SIRT3
and overexpression of SIRT1 and SIRT3 increases the
cytoplasmic localization of LKB1 in breast cancer cells.

DISCUSSION
Over the last decade, there has been growing
emphasis on the importance of EMT, an essential normal
physiological process for embryonic development, tissue
remodeling and wound healing, now implicated in cancer
progression. An oncogenic EMT causes epithelial-derived
tumors to gain a mesenchymal phenotype facilitating
migration and invasion potential of cancer cells.
Acquisition of mesenchymal traits not only promotes
dissemination of cancer cells from primary tumors,
increasing metastatic progression but is also linked with
other pro-metastatic traits such as increase in tumorinitiating cell (TIC)-characteristics including self-renewal,
multipotency and resistance to conventional therapeutics
[33–35]. Recent studies from our lab and others have
shown an important role of leptin in acquisition of
mesenchymal characteristics, and survival of cancer
stem cells (CSCs) in vitro and in vivo [13, 20]. Striving
to develop effective, clinically viable leptin-antagonists
using bioactive compounds, we recently discovered that
HNK is capable of inhibiting breast cancer growth in
hyperleptinemic state [30]. These discoveries sparked

Figure 7: Schematic representation of the mechanism whereby HNK inhibits leptin-induced EMT and stemness via
LKB1 and miR-34a. Leptin treatment inhibits LKB1 expression. Honokiol treatment induces the expression levels of SIRT1/3 and
stimulates the expression as well as cytoplasmic localization of LKB1 and also increases the levels of miR-34a leading to the inhibition
of EMT and stemness markers. Honokiol treatment results in the inhibition of EMT, migration and mammosphere formation even in the
presence of leptin.

These results support a role for SIRT1/3 in HNK-mediated
LKB1 activation. Although a role of LKB1 in cancer
cell EMT has been proposed in cancer cells [49], the
underlying molecular mechanisms remain elusive. We
discovered that LKB1 plays an important role in HNKmediated upregulation of miR-34a expression in breast
cancer cells. This is an important finding as miR-34a is
involved in tumor suppression by inhibiting various genes
regulating cell proliferation, migration, invasion and EMT
in many cancer types including breast cancer [50]. Our
study shows that miR-34a is not only vital for HNKmediated inhibition of EMT, and stemness but also plays
an important role in HNK-mediated inhibition of leptinfunction. Considering that miRs are promising candidates
as biomarkers owing to their low complexity, stability,
and ease of amplification and quantification, miR-34a can
potentially serve as a biomarker for HNK function.
The realization of the impact of hyperleptinemia
associated with obese state on breast cancer incidence,
behavior, and prognosis, has spurred a great interest in the
development of effective strategies to inhibit multipartite
leptin signaling and oncogenic functions. Various
approaches have been proposed to neutralize leptin activity
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

either by directly targeting leptin or deactivating leptin
receptor, for example, soluble leptin receptors (LRs),
leptin peptidomimetics (LPA-2), synthetic leptinantagonists, and anti-LR monoclonal antibodies (anti-LR
mAbs) [17, 51–53]. Leptin receptor antagonists, Aca 1
(aa 121–129; modifications Nva123, Aca129) and Allo-aca
(aa 121–129; modifications alloThr121, Nva123, Aca129)
have been shown to inhibit leptin-dependent growth and
signaling in various cancer cells [54, 55]. In addition, Stat3
inhibitors (chemical and bioactive) have been shown to
block leptin signaling [56]. It is well-recognized that an
ideal strategy to inhibit oncogenic effects of leptin should
be safe, highly efficacious, and should lack toxicity to
allow long-term use. Our study showed the potential of
HNK as an effective and non-toxic inhibitor of oncogenic
effects of leptin. HNK is particularly encouraging as it
exhibits desirable spectrum of bioavailability in contrast
with many other natural products [57]. While poor
absorption and rapid excretion has marred the development
of many other polyphenolic agents [58], HNK does not
have these deficiencies. It has been shown that HNK can
cross the blood-brain barrier and significant systemic levels
of HNK can be achieved in preclinical models [59]. Owing

to these qualities, HNK is a promising bioactive agent to
be developed as leptin-antagonist.
In conclusion, we uncovered a novel role of HNK as
an inhibitor of leptin-induced EMT and stemness, which
involves LKB1 and miR-34a. Our results demonstrate
the integral role of a previously unrecognized functional
crosstalk between LKB1 and miR-34a in facilitating
HNK-mediated inhibition of oncogenic actions of leptin.

Whole cell lysate was prepared by scraping breast
cancer cells in 250 μl of ice cold modified RIPA buffer
[64]. Equal amount of lysate protein was resolved on
sodium-dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel, transferred
to nitrocellulose membrane, and western blot analysis
was performed. Immunodetection was performed using
enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL system, Amersham
Pharmacia Biotech Inc., Arlington Heights, IL) according
to manufacturer’s instructions.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Ethics statement

RNA isolation, miR, transfection and RT-PCR

The investigation was conducted in accordance
with the ethical standards and guidelines approved by
the authors’ institutional review board (Johns Hopkins
University IACUC).

For RNA isolation and RT-PCR, total cellular
RNA was extracted using the TRIzol Reagent (Life
Technologies, Inc., Rockville, MD). RT-PCR was
performed using specific sense and antisense PCR primers.
Cells were transfected with miR-34a mimic or miR-34a
inhibitor or control-miR (Applied Biosystems, Ambion,
Austin, TX) using Fugene transfection reagent (Promega
Corporation, Madison, WI). Standardization of miR-34a
mimic and inhibitor is shown in supplementary figure 4.
For qRT-PCR detection of miR-34a, miRNA-specific
RT-primers (assay IDs: hsa-miR-34a, 000426), TaqMan
miRNA Assay (Applied Biosystems, Ambion, Austin, TX)
and Platinum Taq Polymerase Reagents (Invitrogen, Grand
Island, NY) were used. Data were calculated by using
the standard ΔΔCt method and microRNA expression
was represented as fold-difference of each treatment
vs. vehicle-treated control. Statistics was performed by
using one-way ANOVA and Student’s t-test post-hoc
analysis. Statistical significance was accepted when p was
<0.05. pcDNA3-Flag-LKB1-wild-type (LKB1-WT),
Flag-SIRT1, pcDNA3.1-Flag-SIRT3 plasmid constructs
were transfected using Fugene 6 (Promega Corporation,
Madison, WI) transfection reagent.

Cell culture and reagents
The human breast cancer cell lines, MCF7, MDAMB-468, SUM149, SUM159, T47D, SKBR3 and MDAMB-231 were obtained from the American Type Culture
Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA), resuscitated from
early passage liquid nitrogen vapor stocks as needed
and cultured according to supplier’s instructions. Cell
line authentication was done by analysis of known
genetic markers or response (e.g., expression of estrogen
receptor and p53 and estrogen responsiveness). Cells
were cultured for less than 3 months before reinitiating
cultures and were routinely inspected microscopically
for stable phenotype. For treatment, cells were seeded at
a density of 1 X 106 /100-mm tissue culture dish. After
16 hours of serum starvation, the culture media were
changed to serum free media containing treatments as
indicated. Cells were treated with 100 ng/ml human
recombinant leptin (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). We extracted
Honokiol (HNK) from seed cone of Magnolia grandiflora
according to our previously published study [60]. Previous
studies from our lab have shown that 25 μM honokiol
inhibits cell viability, and cell proliferation while 5 μM
honokiol doesn’t affect cell viability and proliferation.
Accordingly, we used 5 μM honokiol to examine the
effect of honokiol on mammosphere formation, migration,
and invasion [28, 29][30]. Antibodies for Slug (C19G7),
Snail (L70G2), Zeb2 (ab25837), Nanog (D73G4), Oct4
(#2750), Sox2 (D6D9), LKB1 (D60C5), SIRT1 (C14H4),
SIRT3 (C73E3), E-cadherin (24E10), and Occludin
(D15G7) were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology
(Danvers, MA). β-Actin antibody was purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). Synthetic miRNA
miR-34a mimic and siRNA were purchased from Applied
Biosystems (Ambion, Austin, TX). pcDNA3-FlagLKB1-wild-type (LKB1-WT), Flag-SIRT1, pcDNA3.1Flag-SIRT3 plasmid constructs were procured from
Addgene [61–63].

Immunofluorescence and confocal imaging
Breast cancer cells were subjected to immunofluorescence analysis. Fixed and immunofluorescently stained cells were imaged using a Zeiss
LSM510 Meta (Zeiss) laser scanning confocal system
configured to a Zeiss Axioplan 2 upright microscope. All
experiments were performed multiple times using independent biological replicates.

Scratch-migration assay
To perform migration assays [12, 64]; cells were
plated into the 6-well cell culture plate. Cells were allowed
to grow in DMEM containing 10% FBS to confluence,
and then were washed with serum-free medium and
serum starved for 16 h. A 1-mm wide scratch was made
across the cell layer using a sterile pipette tip. Plates were
29958

photographed immediately after scratching. Cells were
treated with human recombinant leptin at 100 ng/ml and/
or HNK at 5 μM alone and in combination. Plates were
photographed after 8 h, 24 h and 48 h at the identical
location of the initial image.

Zeb1, Zeb2, Slug and actin. All animal studies were
in accordance with the guidelines of Johns Hopkins
University IACUC.

Mammosphere assays were performed as previously

All experiments were performed thrice in triplicates.
Statistical analysis was performed using Microsoft Excel
software. Significant differences were analyzed using
student’s t test and two-tailed distribution. Results were
considered to be statistically significant if p < 0.05.
Results were expressed as mean ± SE between triplicate
experiments performed thrice.

Statistical analysis

described [34] and spheres (>50 μm) were counted [65].

Preparation of subcellular fractions
Cellular cytosolic and nuclear fractions were
prepared by incubating cells in 100 μl of ice-cold lysis
buffer [10 mM Tris-Hcl (pH 7.4), 10 mM NaCl, 3 mM
MgCl2 , 0.5% NP-40, 2 mM DTT and 0.1 mM PMSF].
The lysates were incubated for 5min on ice followed by
centrifugation at 4,000g for 10 min at 40C to precipitate
nuclei. Supernatant was stored as cytoplasmic fraction.
Nuclear pellet was incubated with 100 μl of ice-cold
extraction buffer [20 mM Tris-Hcl (pH 7.9), 0.42M KCl,
0.2 mM EDTA, 10% Glycerol, 2 mM DTT and 0.1 mM
PMSF] for 10min followed by centrifugation at 12,000g
for 10min at 40C to clear the nuclear debris. Total protein
was quantified using the Bradford protein assay kit
(Biorad, Hercules, CA). Equal amount of protein was
subjected to western blot analysis.
