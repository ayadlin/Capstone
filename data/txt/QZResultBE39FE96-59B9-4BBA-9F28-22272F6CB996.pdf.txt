BACKGROUND: Epidermal growth factor receptor overexpression is associated with poor outcomes in urothelial carcinoma (UC).
Cetuximab (CTX) exhibited an antitumor effect in in vivo UC models. The efficacy of gemcitabine/cisplatin (GC) with or without CTX
in patients with advanced UC was evaluated. METHODS: Patients with advanced UC, measurable disease, and adequate organ function were randomized 1:2 to cisplatin (70 mg/m2) on day 1 plus gemcitabine (1000 mg/m2) on days 1, 8, and 15 (arm A) or GC plus
CTX (500 mg/m2) on days 1 and 15 (arm B). The primary endpoint was the overall response rate. The secondary endpoints were the
response duration, safety, progression-free survival, overall survival, determination of whether or not CTX sensitized nonresponders
to GC, and exploratory biomarker analysis. The accrual targets were 27 and 54 patients for the 2 arms, respectively. The overall
response rate was reported by arm with binomial confidence intervals (CIs). Kaplan-Meier methods were used for time-to-event endpoints. RESULTS: Eighty-eight eligible patients were randomized; 87 were toxicity-evaluable, and 85 were response-evaluable. The
overall response rates were 57.1% for arm A (95% CI 5 37%-76%) and 61.4% for arm B (95% CI 5 48%-74%). The median progressionfree survival times were 8.5 months for arm A (95% CI 5 5.7-10.4 months) and 7.6 months for arm B (95% CI 5 6.1-8.7 months). The median overall survival times were 17.4 months for arm A (95% CI 5 12.8 months to unreached) and 14.3 months for arm B (95% CI 5 11.622.2 months). The most common grade 3/grade 4 adverse events in both arms were myelosuppression and nausea. Thromboembolism, acneiform rash, fatigue, pain, hypersensitivity reactions, elevated transaminases, hyponatremia, and hypomagnesemia were
more common in arm B; 3 grade 5 adverse events occurred in arm B. The presence of primary disease significantly correlated with
thromboembolism. An increased soluble E-cadherin level after cycle 2 correlated with a higher risk of death. CONCLUSIONS: GC plus

INTRODUCTION
Gemcitabine/cisplatin (GC) is standard first-line chemotherapy for advanced urothelial carcinoma (UC) patients with an
approximately 50% objective response rate, a time to progression of 7 to 8 months, a median survival time of 14 to 15
months, and a 5-year overall survival (OS) rate of 13% to 15%.1
Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) overexpression has been described in solid tumors, including UC.2-4
EGFR signaling functions as an oncogene promoting cell proliferation, differentiation, survival, invasion, angiogenesis,
and metastasis.5,6 In UC, EGFR overexpression in the primary tumor has been associated with higher tumor grade, stage,
disease progression, and shorter survival.7-14 UC metastases frequently overexpress EGFR protein: a study reported 85%
EGFR membranous expression (65% overexpression) in metastatic sites with a relatively high concordance expression

pattern between primary and metastatic specimens.11 In
contrast to colorectal cancer, KRAS mutations are rare in
UC (0%-5%).15-19 Thus, the KRAS mutation status is
not expected to modulate the response to EGFR targeting.
In vitro data indicate that EGFR is activated in response
to chemotherapy attenuating apoptosis.20 An EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), gefitinib, inhibited
chemotherapy-induced EGFR activation in bladder cancer cell lines; a combined treatment with gefitinib/etoposide significantly increased apoptosis in comparison with
etoposide alone.20 Synergy has been shown between GC
and lapatinib, an anti-EGFR/human epidermal growth
factor receptor 2 (HER2) TKI.21 These results suggest
that a combination of EGFR blockade with chemotherapy may overcome drug resistance, and this is further supported by clinical data for other solid tumors.22,23
Cetuximab (CTX) is a recombinant, human/murine–chimeric monoclonal antibody that specifically
binds the EGFR extracellular domain, and this results in
EGFR inhibition and downregulation of downstream signaling pathways. It is Food and Drug Administration–
approved for other cancers.22,23 CTX exerts dosedependent cytostatic effects on bladder cancer cell lines
and is associated with dose-dependent downregulation of
angiogenic factors and significant regression of established
UC xenografts in athymic mice; this provides supportive
evidence for its clinical investigation in patients with
UC.24
On the basis of these data, we hypothesized that targeting EGFR with CTX would result in higher response
rates and longer times to progression when it was added to
GC.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Key Eligibility Criteria

Eligible patients had a pathological diagnosis of UC (pure
or mixed histology) from primary, metastatic, locally
recurrent, or locally advanced/unresectable (T4bN0 or
TanyN2-3) and measurable bladder or nonbladder disease on imaging; an Eastern Cooperative Oncology
Group performance status  2; a life expectancy  12
weeks; and adequate organ function (absolute neutrophil
count  1500 lL, platelet count  1500 lL, serum creatinine level  1.5 mg/dL or creatinine clearance  50 mL/
min, and total bilirubin level  1.5 mg/dL). Prior neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy was allowed if 6 months
or more had passed since a non–cisplatin-based regimen
or 1 year or more had passed since a cisplatin-based regimen. Patients with an asymptomatic pulmonary embolus
Cancer

or deep vein thrombosis (DVT) were eligible if they were
on anticoagulation and at the physician’s discretion.
Because of the lack of conclusive data regarding its predictive value in UC and other carcinomas for which CTX has
Food and Drug Administration approval, patients were
not preselected on the basis of the status of the EGFR
expression level. The study protocol was approved by the
institutional review board of each participating center,
and all patients provided written informed consent before
study entry. The study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (identifier NCT00645593).
Treatment Plan

Patients were stratified by disease status (unresectable versus recurrent/metastatic) and randomized 1:2 to receive
GC (arm A) or GC plus CTX (arm B). The starting therapy for both arms was as follows: gemcitabine (1000 mg/
m2) on days 1, 8, and 15 and cisplatin (70 mg/m2) on day
1, every 28 days. Because of a higher than expected thromboembolic event (TEE) rate in arm B, the gemcitabine
dose for arm B was decreased to 800 mg/m2 after 42
patients had enrolled in arm B (and 19 patients in arm A).
Patients were also required to start baby aspirin (once
daily). Arm B patients received CTX (500 mg/m2) on
days 1 and 15. Arm A patients who had progressed after 2
cycles (at the first efficacy evaluation) could have CTX
added to GC. After 6 treatment cycles, chemotherapy was
stopped in both arms; however, arm B patients without
disease progression continued on CTX until progression
or unacceptable toxicity if it had been deemed clinically
beneficial. Arm B patients who had completed 4 GC
cycles, had achieved stable disease or better, were tolerating CTX, but were deemed not able to tolerate additional
GC could proceed to maintenance CTX until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients in either arm
with locally advanced disease who responded to treatment
were offered local therapy as deemed medically appropriate. Arm B patients who received local therapy discontinued CTX. Patients in either arm who elected not to
receive or were not candidates for local therapy could continue the protocol therapy.
Patient Evaluation

The baseline evaluation included a complete history/physical examination, a comprehensive metabolic profile,
magnesium, and a complete blood count. C-reactive protein (CRP) and D-dimer baseline levels were added to the
study after 37 patients had been enrolled to assess any correlation with TEEs. Baseline imaging included abdominal/pelvic computed tomography or magnetic resonance
2685

Original Article

imaging, chest X-ray or computed tomography, and a
radionucleotide bone scan. Imaging was repeated every 8
weeks while patients were on the study therapy. After the
completion of the study therapy, imaging was required every 12 6 2 weeks for the first 24 weeks and then every 16
weeks for a year. Thereafter, imaging was required every 6
months for years 3 to 5 and otherwise as clinically indicated until progression was documented. The Common
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (version 3.0) of
the National Cancer Institute were used for adverse event
reporting.

Correlative Studies

Serum soluble E-cadherin (sE-cad) was evaluated as a
potential predictor of outcome; this was based on data suggesting that a sensitivity to EGFR inhibition requires Ecadherin expression in UC cells.25 E-cadherin is expressed
in epithelial cells, and data suggest that EGFR could mediate E-cadherin proteolysis and the production of sEcad.26,27 We hypothesized that patients with advanced UC
would have decreased sE-cad levels in response to antiEGFR therapy and that this would correlate with a higher
response rate. Serum was collected at the baseline, at the
end of cycle 2, at the completion of chemotherapy, and at
disease progression so that the sE-cad level could be measured. Blood was drawn in a standard serum separator tube
and was spun at 1300g for 10 minutes. Serum was harvested immediately in labeled cryovials (Fisher Scientific)
and stored at 280 C. sE-cad was measured with an
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (R&D Systems
Quantikine kit) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. In addition, baseline CRP and D-dimer levels were
measured to evaluate any correlation with TEEs.

Statistical Considerations

The primary endpoint was the overall response rate
(ORR; ie, Complete Response (CR) 1 Partial Response
(PR), which was defined as the best confirmed response at
any time point during the trial in accordance with the
Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (version
1.0).28 Secondary endpoints included the response duration, safety, progression-free survival (PFS), OS, and
ORR after crossover to CTX in patients progressing on
chemotherapy alone.
This was a randomized phase 2 trial with patients
randomized 1:2 to GC and GC plus CTX. Historical
response rates with GC are variable and depend on the
extent of disease and sites; hence, this design ensured a rel2686

evant comparison group by including a control arm and
allowed more experience to be gained with the experimental agent (CTX). It was hypothesized that adding CTX to
chemotherapy would increase ORR by 15%. The
randomized selection design was used to compare treatment regimens.29 Under the assumption that chemotherapy (control) would result in a 50% ORR and that a
difference in ORR of 15% (an experimental arm with an
ORR  65%) would be clinically meaningful and with
the use of a 1:2 randomization schema, it was estimated
that 27 patients would need to be randomized to the control arm and 54 would need to be randomized to the experimental arm to result in a 90% probability that the
arm with the higher ORR would be found. The primary
endpoint of best ORR is reported for each arm with associated 95% binomial confidence intervals (CIs). Descriptive proportions with frequencies and mean ages with age
ranges are reported. Median PFS values, OS values, and
response durations are reported with product-limit estimates from Kaplan-Meier methods with corresponding
95% CIs and log-rank tests. Tested toxicity comparisons
are reported with mid P values.
Exploratory correlative analyses of sE-cad levels were
completed. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay triplicates were averaged for each sample. Differences from the
baseline (before treatment began) were calculated for each
sample taken after treatment had started (after cycle 2, at
the end of chemotherapy, and at disease progression). PFS
and OS associations with the baseline sE-cad level and the
sE-cad level change after cycle 2, at the end of chemotherapy, and at progression in comparison with the baseline
were individually tested with Cox models. When a statistically significant association was found, further exploration
with multivariate models was performed. To determine
whether sE-cad was predictive or prognostic, interactions
of the sE-cad level and the treatment were tested in the
models.

Baseline Characteristics and Treatment
Summary (Tables 1 and 2)

Between June 2008 and January 2011, 89 patients were
accrued from 12 institutions; 88 of the 89 eligible patients
were randomized (1 patient was randomized to arm A,
treated, and developed grade 4 [G4] neutropenia but was
found to be ineligible upon histology review and was
removed from the study). Follow-up continued until data
cutoff in May 2013. Patient characteristics were well balanced between the arms. More than 70% of the patients

had bladder primary, and approximately 90% had systemic metastasis. Before receiving treatment, 1 patient
randomized to arm B withdrew consent; thus, 87 patients
were evaluable for toxicity (28 in arm A and 59 in arm B).
After receiving <4 weeks of treatment, 2 patients in arm
B withdrew consent (patients’ wishes) and thus were not
evaluable with respect to their response (Fig. 1 and Table
2). The median number of treatment cycles was 6 in arm
A (71% of the patients received 6 cycles) and 5 in arm B
(47% of the patients received 6 cycles); the median duration of treatment (including maintenance CTX) was
approximately 5 months for both arms (Table 2). The
mean dose intensities of GC per cycle were similar in the
2 arms (Table 2). In arm B, 26 patients (44%) continued
on CTX monotherapy with a median of 3 cycles (1-36); 8
of them received >6 cycles of CTX maintenance. Only 1
patient in arm A (bladder primary and metastases in the
lymph nodes, liver, and lung) had disease progression after
2 chemotherapy cycles and was eligible to receive CTX;
she received 32 cycles of CTX and was still on treatment
at the time of the last follow-up.

Safety and Tolerability

Table 3 summarizes the most frequent (>5% of eligible
patients) G3 to G5 adverse events. The most common
G3/G4 adverse events in both arms were myelosuppression and nausea. In arm B, 17 patients (29%) experienced
G3/G4 TEEs, whereas 3 patients (11%) in arm A did
(P 5 .08). Nineteen patients with G3/G4 TEEs had an
unresected primary tumor; only 1 patient with prior primary tumor resection had a TEE (P 5 .01). In arm A,
17% of the patients with an unresected primary tumor
had G3/G4 TEEs, whereas 0% with a resected primary
tumor did; 35% and 8%, respectively, had G3/G4 TEEs
in arm B (P 5 .01). No association was found between the
metastatic site and G3/G4 TEEs (P 5 .44). Four of 17
G3/G4 TEEs in arm B occurred after the amendment
that decreased the gemcitabine dose. The G3/G4 TEE
proportions in arm B were 30% before the amendment
and 24% after the amendment. In all, there were 20 G3/
G4 TEEs in the study: 7 were lower extremity DVT, 10
were pulmonary embolisms (with or without DVT), 1
was port-related right jugular vein thrombosis, 1 was

thrombosis, and 1 was left lower limb ischemia.
G3/G4 acneiform rash, fatigue, hypersensitivity
reactions, pain, elevated transaminases, hyponatremia,
and hypomagnesemia were more common in arm B (Table 3). Five patients discontinued CTX monotherapy
because of adverse events: 3 patients had skin toxicity,
another had G4 left lower limb ischemia due to severe peripheral vascular atherosclerosis (an adverse event was also
deemed possibly related to CTX), and another patient
with no documented baseline pulmonary pathology

developed G4 interstitial pneumonitis that was deemed
possibly related to CTX because no other etiology was
identified. There were 3 treatment-related deaths, all in
arm B (5%, 95% CI 5 0.01-0.14). The patient with
pneumonitis improved but ultimately died of ongoing/
worsening respiratory failure 5 months later with no evidence of disease recurrence. Another patient died suddenly 1 week after cycle 2 of therapy (day 1); this was
unexpected without an identified cause and was deemed
possibly related to therapy. A third patient died of acute

Efficacy Analysis

ORR was 57% in arm A and 61% in arm B with overlapping 95% CIs (Table 4). ORR in arm B did not significantly change after gemcitabine dose adjustments (26/41
[63.4%] before and 9/16 [56.3%] after, P 5 .76). In addition, 32% (arm A) and 19% (arm B) had the best response
of stable disease. The median duration of stable disease
was similar for the 2 arms: 8.5 months for arm A and 8.7
months for arm B. The median PFS was 8.5 months

(P 5 .43; Fig. 2B and Table 4). One patient in arm A and
1 (despite lymph node progression) of 4 patients in arm B
with an unresectable tumor underwent surgical resection
after chemotherapy. One patient (arm B) was receiving
CTX monotherapy without progression at the time of the
last follow-up. The patient who progressed on chemotherapy in arm A and had CTX added achieved long-term disease control and was continuing on CTX monotherapy at
the time of the last follow-up.

The baseline sE-cad levels did not differ between the arms
(arm A, median 5 43.0 ng/mL [range 5 27-511 ng/mL];
arm B, median 5 43.6 ng/mL [range 5 20-147 ng/mL];

The sE-cad level change versus the baseline differed with
the treatment arm after cycle 2 (arm A, median 5 43
[range 5 26-91]; arm B, median 5 40 [range 5 16-228];

[range 5 34-73]; arm B, median 5 37 [range 5 25-80];
paired-difference P 5 .01); the sE-cad level increased with
treatment in arm A but decreased in arm B (Fig. 3). In the
single patient who crossed over, the sE-cad level increased
after 2 cycles of chemotherapy but decreased after 4 treatment cycles in arm B. In an exploratory analysis of sE-cad
as a prognostic or predictive biomarker, the sE-cad level
2690

change at the end of cycle 2 in comparison with the baseline did not correlate with ORR or PFS, but it was significantly associated with the risk of death. An increase in the
sE-cad level of 5 ng/mL after cycle 2 resulted in a 13%
higher risk of death (hazard ratio 5 1.13, 95% CI 5 1.031.25). This association remained significant in a multivariate analysis (hazard ratio 5 1.14, 95% CI 5 1.03-1.26)
that accounted for the treatment arm, age, gender, primary tumor site, history of prior chemotherapy, and disease status (unresectable vs metastatic). However, the sEcad level change from the baseline to the end of treatment
or time of disease progression was not significantly associated with the risk of death. The baseline sE-cad level or
the sE-cad level change after 2 cycles did not correlate significantly with TEEs.
CRP and D-Dimers

There were 41 patients (15 in arm A and 26 in arm B)
with available baseline samples; 53% and 46% patients
had abnormal CRP levels, whereas 67% and 81% had
abnormal D-dimer levels in arms A and B, respectively.
There was no significant association between the baseline
CRP or D-dimer levels and TEEs in either arm. The baseline CRP and D-dimer levels were not significantly associated with ORR, PFS, or OS.
DISCUSSION
Adding CTX to standard first-line GC was feasible, but it
did not improve outcomes and was associated with a
higher rate of G3/G4 adverse events, including TEEs.
Bladder cancer and chemotherapy are associated with

TEEs30; however, the rate observed in arm B was unexpected, particularly because as a single agent CTX was not
previously known to be associated with an increased TEE
risk.31 A recent meta-analysis of prospective randomized
trials concluded that anti-EGFR agents, especially CTX,
are associated with a significantly higher TEE risk.32
However, this was not known when the study was
amended to reduce the gemcitabine dose. The latter was
based on the reduced TEE rate noted after a gemcitabine
dose reduction in a previous trial of GC with bevacizumab
in UC patients in which a high TEE rate was encountered.33 Interestingly, in our study, no patient with a previously resected primary tumor had TEEs, which were
mostly lower extremity DVT and/or pulmonary embolisms. It is not clear whether this observation is a function
of a locoregional effect of the tumor or systemic effects
related to the presence of the primary tumor.
Although the study was not powered to detect significant differences, the observed lack of improvement in the
antitumor effect with the addition of CTX to GC could
be related to several factors. The gemcitabine dose reduction did not appear to be a significant factor because at the
time of the dose-reduction implementation, two-thirds of
the patients were randomized, and there was no significant ORR difference based on the gemcitabine dose. The
lower median number of chemotherapy cycles in arm B
may have played some role. The unselected design may
also be a contributor because the study may have been
underpowered to detect outcome differences in patients
with EGFR overexpression. However, to date, there is no
validated predictive biomarker for a response to antiEGFR therapies in UC, and the tissue EGFR expression
level has not been established as a predictor of a response
to EGFR-targeted therapy. However, the strong association between EGFR and poor outcomes and the recent
genomic data indicating a high gene copy number of
EGFR in a number of UC tumors suggest that a patient
subset might benefit from EGFR inhibition.34,35
Another consideration is whether CTX is the appropriate anti-EGFR agent in UC. As a single agent, CTX
had no activity in patients with previously treated UC.36
In a trial using lapatinib as a single agent in 34 patients
with platinum-resistant advanced UC, 1 objective
response was identified, and 18 patients had stable disease;
the median time to progression was 8.6 weeks, and the
median OS was 17.9 weeks.37 However, in a subset analysis based on EGFR/HER2 expression levels, 17 of 19
patients with a clinical benefit from lapatinib had tumors
overexpressing EGFR and/or HER2, and this suggested
that biomarker-based enrichment may be important. As a
Cancer

single agent, gefitinib, another anti-EGFR TKI, was ineffective as a second-line therapy for metastatic UC.38
In combination with chemotherapy, CTX appeared
to modestly augment the activity of paclitaxel in 39
patients with previously treated UC,36 whereas gefitinib
did not appear to improve outcomes in combination with
GC in comparison with historical controls using GC
alone.39 Collectively, reported studies, including ours,
have failed to show a significant benefit from anti-EGFR
agents in patients with advanced UC. However, there
appear to be occasional patients, including some in our
study, who seem to derive a benefit from anti-EGFR therapy. Other ongoing trials will help to shed light on the
potential role of targeting EGFR in UC; lapatinib with
GC is being tested as a first-line treatment (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT00623064), whereas docetaxel/
lapatinib is being evaluated as a second-line therapy
(NCT01382706) for UC. An ongoing phase 2 trial is
evaluating docetaxel/gefitinib as maintenance after firstline chemotherapy (NCT00479089).
Targeting only EGFR may not be sufficient for a
complex disease such as UC. Moreover, heterodimerization of EGFR with the other HERs might circumvent
EGFR inhibition and drive parallel mitogen-activating
signaling.40,41 Therefore, more potent inhibitors with an
irreversible mechanism and broader anti-HER activity
may provide more comprehensive signaling inhibition
and greater antitumor effects. Dacomitinib, a novel,
potent, and irreversible pan-HER inhibitor, has shown
promising antitumor activity in human bladder cancer
models.42 A better understanding of UC biology can elucidate potential predictors of response and resistance, help
to select patients, and guide the successful development of
targeted therapies in UC.34,35,43-46
In agreement with our hypothesis, sE-cad decreased
with CTX. This may represent a loss of the epithelial tumor component, an inhibition of EGFR-mediated E-cadherin proteolysis, or a cell epithelial-to-mesenchymal
transition. This sE-cad level reduction did not correlate
with a response to either therapy or PFS; however, an
increased sE-cad level was independently associated with a
higher risk of death, regardless of treatment. Most studies
have associated tissue E-cadherin expression loss with UC
recurrence/progression.47-60 A higher plasma sE-cad level
has been associated with bladder cancer in comparison
with healthy controls; a higher preoperative plasma sEcad level has been associated with nodal metastases and
shorter PFS in patients treated with radical cystectomy.61
Our findings are exploratory, and the role of sE-cad in
UC merits further investigation.

In conclusion, the combination of CTX and GC did
not improve outcomes. This multicenter trial demonstrated the feasibility of accruing patients and conducting
large randomized phase 2 trials investigating targeted
agents in UC in a reasonable time period. The lack of benefit from an agent that targets a seemingly important pathway and has an established role in other solid tumors
clearly highlights the importance of the biological context
to the use of targeted therapies and the need to understand
the molecular biology of UC to better inform drug development and affect outcomes.
