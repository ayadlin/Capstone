BACKGROUND: Epigenetic events play a major role in the carcinogenesis of tobacco-related cancers. The authors conducted a retrospective cohort study to evaluate the effects of exposure to the anticonvulsant agent valproic acid (VPA), a histone deacetylase inhibitor, on the risk of developing cancers of the lung, head and neck, prostate, bladder, and colon. METHODS: The study was based
on the 2002 through 2008 National Veterans Affairs (VA) medical SAS data set linked to the VA Central Cancer Registry. The cohort
was defined as subjects aged > 40 years who were followed in the VA system for at least 1 year for 1 of 4 diagnoses for which a VPA
indication exists (bipolar disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, migraines, and seizures). Multivariable Cox proportional hazards
models were used to estimate hazards ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) reflecting the association between use of
VPA and cancer incidence. RESULTS: VPA use was associated with a significant reduction in the risk of cancers of the head and neck
(HR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.48-0.92). Additional associations were noted with the duration of treatment and median VPA drug levels. No significant differences in cancer incidence were observed for cancers of the lung (HR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.84-1.19), bladder (HR, 0.86; 95% CI,
0.64-1.15), colon (HR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.74-1.22), and prostate (HR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.88-1.12). CONCLUSIONS: Use of VPA is associated

INTRODUCTION
Epigenetic changes, involving either DNA methylation or changes in chromatin structure,1,2 are early carcinogenic events
in many cancer sites including the lung,3-5 prostate,6,7 colon,8,9 bladder,10,11 and head and neck.12-14 DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) and histone deacetylases (HDACs) are major epigenetic mediators for which pharmacologic inhibitors
are available. In animal models, inhibition of DNMTs and HDACs has been shown to prevent the development of both
lung15 and prostate cancers.16 In addition, our own data have indicated that HDACs 1, 2, and 3 are not only associated
with increased DNMT1 protein levels in patients with lung cancer compared with normal controls, but that they are
directly responsible for stabilizing DNMT1 expression.17 Valproic acid (VPA), which has been widely used among
patients with psychiatric or neurologic disorders as a mood stabilizer or antiepileptic drug, has recently been reported to
act as a class 1 HDAC inhibitor.18 HDAC inhibition is observed at VPA concentrations as low as 40 ug/mL.17 Epigenetic
therapies such as the DNMT inhibitor azacytidine and the HDAC inhibitor vorinostat have been proven effective against
several hematologic malignancies such as myelodysplastic syndrome19-21and cutaneous T-cell lymphomas.22 A recent
phase 2 study demonstrated promise for the combination of azacytidine with the HDAC inhibitor entinostat for the treatment of patients with lung cancer.23 However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no clinical evidence to date of an association between the use of HDAC inhibitors and cancer risk.
Given the importance of epigenetic mechanisms in early carcinogenesis24 and the preclinical evidence supporting
the anticarcinogenic effects of VPA,25 we conducted a retrospective cohort study evaluating the risk of various malignancies in relation to use of VPA.

Reduced HNC Risk After VPA Use/Kang et al

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Data Sources

The National Veterans Affairs (VA) Medical SAS data sets
were searched in conjunction with the VA Decision Support System data from the VA Corporate Data Warehouse.
The project was approved by the Institutional Review
Board at Emory University and by the Research and Development Committee at the Atlanta VA Medical Center.
Data were extracted by the VA Informatics and Computing
Infrastructure. The data elements obtained on each study
subject included scrambled social security number, sex, age,
first date of encounter, last date of encounter, first VPA prescription filled, last VPA prescription filled, serum drug levels for VPA when available, International Classification of
Diseases29th edition codes of associated psychiatric (bipolar disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder [PTSD], depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, and substance and alcohol
abuse) or neurologic (migraines and seizures) diagnoses,
and smoking-related comorbidities such as coronary artery
disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
(COPD). The smoking status of the study subjects was
determined from health flags, which are recorded by clinical providers at the end of a clinical visit and serve as a quality measure for medical care delivered in the VA system.
Smoking-related health flags characterize patients as
“never-smoker,” “nonsmoker,” “nonsmoker for more than
X number of years,” “past smoker,” and “current smoker”
and also include information regarding smoking cessation
counseling. Cancer cases were ascertained by linking the
data from the VA Corporate Data Warehouse with the VA
Central Cancer Registry (VACCR) in Washington, DC
using scrambled social security numbers as unique identifiers. The VACCR has been reported to capture at least
90% of patients with cancer who are treated in the VA
system.26
Study Population

The inclusion criteria for the main cohort were as follows: 1) the presence of at least one diagnosis of psychiatric or neurologic diseases for which long-term VPA has
an accepted clinical indication (bipolar disorder, PTSD,
migraines, or seizures); 2) clinical follow-up for a duration of at least 1 year; 3) current smoker or former
smoker status; and 4) aged at least 40 years at the inclusion of the cohort. We excluded patients without evidence of a smoking history because the preponderance of
the preclinical evidence points toward a particular role
for HDAC-mediated and DNMT1-mediated epigenetic
changes in the etiology of smoking-related cancers. Subjects who received a cancer diagnosis within 1 year after
Cancer

their first visit to the VA were excluded to account for
possible asymptomatic prevalent cases. Furthermore,
because all 5 types of cancer studied in the current analysis are very rare in young patients, we excluded patients
who were aged < 40 years. This enrichment of patients
at risk for smoking-related cancers based on age and
smoking status is supported by numerous studies evaluating interventions for the risk reduction of such cancers.27-29 Given that there was concern that the VACCR
may have underreported cancer cases in the early years
since its inception in 1999, we defined the beginning of
the observation period as the later date of either January
1, 2002 or the first visit to the VA for 1 of the 4 inclusion diagnoses. At the time of analysis, VACCR data
were available until December 31, 2008, which was
defined as the end of the study period. Because shortterm drug exposure is unlikely to influence cancer risk,
we excluded patients with < 1 year of VPA use.30 The
start of the observation period was defined as the first
visit for 1 of the 4 inclusion diagnoses for non-VPA users
and the date of the first filled prescription for VPA users.
The end of the observation period was either the date of
a cancer diagnosis, the last visit date for 1 of the inclusion
diagnoses, or the end of the study period.
Statistical Analysis

All statistical analyses were performed using SAS statistical software (version 9.2; SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC).
All the tests were 2-sided, with statistical significance
established at P < .05. The characteristics of each cohort
were compared using the chi-square test and Student t
test. Cancer incidence over the follow-up period was calculated as a rate of new occurrences of cancer over the
total number of person-years and further explored using
the Kaplan-Meier method. Univariate analyses of cancer
incidence and cancer deaths were performed using the
log-rank test. Multivariate adjusted hazards ratios (HRs)
for cancer incidence were determined using the Cox proportional hazards model. Covariates considered in the
multivariate analyses were age, sex, race, smoking status,
psychiatric disease (bipolar disorder, PTSD, schizophrenia, depression, or anxiety), neurologic disease (seizures
and migraines), COPD, and evidence of alcohol and
substance abuse. Formal tests were conducted to confirm
the assumption of proportionality. To assess the impact
of the duration of VPA exposure and VPA serum drug
levels, similar multivariate analyses were performed for
different intervals of VPA use and levels. For propensity
score analyses, propensity scores for VPA use were calculated from logistic regression analysis using age at study
1395

entry, sex, race, smoking status, alcohol and substance
abuse, diagnosis of each individual psychiatric and/or
neurologic disorder (using International Classification of
Diseases29th edition codes), and COPD as independent
variables. Propensity scores were used in a multivariate
model as an independent variable and in subgroup analyses divided by quintiles of propensity score.31 Tests for
interactions between VPA use, alcohol use, and smoking
were conducted.
Propensity scores for VPA use were calculated from
the logistic regression model that used age at study entry,
sex, smoking status, substance abuse, diagnosis of each
individual psychiatric and/or neurologic disorder,
COPD, and coronary artery disease as independent variables. Subgroup analysis by propensity score quintile or
matching by propensity score are well established methods
with which to balance cofactors within groups, thus
reducing biases that could arise from vastly different distributions of these cofactors in a Cox proportional hazards
model.31 Propensity scores were used in a multivariate
model as an independent variable and in subclass analyses
stratified by propensity score quintiles.31
RESULTS
Cohort Characteristics

A total of 636,051 individuals aged > 40 years were initially identified. After excluding never-smokers, patients
with unknown smoking status, and those who had a cancer diagnosis within the first year after their first VA visit,
the final cohort consisted of 439,628 patients, 26,911 of
whom had filled prescriptions for VPA for > 1 year. The
mean follow-up duration was 4.40 years (standard deviation [SD], 2.29 years) for non-VPA users and 4.42 years
(SD, 2.05 years) for VPA users (P 5 .11). VPA users on
average were slightly younger than nonusers (median age,
59 years vs 60 years), and tended to have a higher incidence of bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, seizure disorders, migraines, and alcohol and substance abuse. The
prevalence of PTSD, depression, and anxiety was lower in
VPA users. No significant differences between VPA users
and nonusers were observed in terms of percentages of former (51%) and current (49%) smokers as well as the prevalence of COPD (18%) at baseline (Table 1). In addition,
despite the risk of weight gain with VPA, body mass indices were not found to be significantly different between
the 2 groups.

nonusers are shown in Table 2. In the multivariate analysis,
VPA use was associated with significant reductions in the
risk of head and neck cancers (HR, 0.66; 95% confidence
interval [95% CI], 0.48-0.92). No association between
VPA use and risk reduction was observed for lung, colorectal, prostate, or bladder cancers. No interaction was
found between VPA use, smoking status, and alcohol use.
Relationship Between Duration of VPA Use and
VPA Blood Levels and Risk of Head and Neck
Cancer

The relationship between the duration of VPA use and
the risk of head and neck cancer is shown in Figure 1.
Compared with VPA nonusers, those who used VPA for 1
to 3 years were found to have no significant reduction in
their risk of developing head and neck cancer (HR, 0.96;
95% CI, 0.58-1.60), whereas subjects with a duration of
exposure of  3 years experienced a significant risk reduction (HR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.39-0.85) (Fig. 1). Next, we

analyzed the association between median VPA drug levels
and the reduction in head and neck cancer risk by dose
using the previously defined cutoff of 40 ug/mL for effective HDAC inhibition.17 A statistically significant risk
reduction for head and neck cancer was observed only in
the group of patients who had median VPA levels in the
therapeutic range for HDAC inhibition (HR, 0.59; 95%
CI, 0.35-0.99) (Fig. 1). Both time and concentration dependence of the VPA effect on head and neck cancer risk
reduction appear to support a causal relationship.
Impact of VPA Use on Clinical Cancer
Characteristics

Squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) of the head and neck
have 2 very different etiologies. In addition to classic risk
factors such as tobacco and alcohol, infections with certain
serotypes of human papillomaviruses (HPVs), most notably HPV type 16, have emerged as a cause of the rapidly
rising incidence of oropharyngeal carcinomas.32-34 A distinction between oropharyngeal and nonoropharyngeal
cancers is important because HDAC inhibitors have been
reported to be capable of inducing apoptosis in HPVinfected cells in vitro, suggesting that a preferential effect
against HPV-positive cancers may exist.35
The results of the current analysis revealed a nearly
equal reduction in the risk of both oropharyngeal (HR,
Cancer

May 1, 2014

0.67; 95% CI, 0.32-1.37) and nonoropharyngeal (HR,
0.67; 95% CI, 0.47-0.95) cancers by VPA (Fig. 1).
Because it is possible that the exclusion of nonsmokers
from the cohort disproportionally eliminated patients
with HPV-related head and neck cancers, we also analyzed
the risks for oropharyngeal (HR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.631.66) and nonoropharyngeal (HR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.570.98) cancers in the entire cohort, including among
never-smokers. These findings argue against a preferential
antiviral mechanism of action for VPA and suggest that
VPA may be particularly effective against smokinginduced SCCs.
DISCUSSION
In this retrospective cohort study of US veterans, VPA use
was found to be associated with a significantly decreased
incidence of head and neck SCC. The observed relationship between long-term exposure to an HDAC inhibitor
(in this case VPA) and reduced cancer risk in this VA
population-based study complements preclinical data on
the role of early epigenetic events in carcinogenesis1 and
to the best of our knowledge confirms for the first time
clinically that inhibitors of epigenetic repressors may serve
as promising cancer prevention agents. The current study
data demonstrated that risk reduction for head and neck
cancers was most pronounced after 3 years of VPA use.

Figure 1. Forest plot is shown demonstrating hazards ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) for the associations
between valproic acid (Valp) use and clinical scenarios. All analyses were conducted as Cox proportional hazards models and
controlled for age, sex, race, smoking status, psychiatric disease (bipolar disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, schizophrenia,
depression, and anxiety), neurologic disease (seizures and migraines), evidence of alcohol and substance abuse, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. V/C indicates Valproate users/controls; HNC, head and neck cancer.

The optimal duration of exposure could not be determined in the current study because the number of events
in patients with longer exposures was limited. A longer
follow-up of the current study cohort or a larger validation
cohort will be necessary to address this question.
Although differences in the baseline clinical characteristics of VPA users versus nonusers in this cohort were
adjusted for by multivariate and propensity score analyses,
potential sources of bias remain. The most important variable in determining the cancer risk of the aerodigestive
system is the cumulative lifetime smoking history. The
health flags collected in the VA databases provide detailed
information regarding the individual’s current smoking
status, but do not provide the cumulative amount of cigarettes smoked. Because the psychiatric comorbidities on
which our cohort selection was based are strongly associated with increased tobacco abuse and tobacco-related
morbidity and mortality,36,37 and because these psychiatric comorbidities are not entirely evenly distributed
between VPA users and nonusers, it is possible that the
lifetime exposure of cigarettes could have been imbalanced between the groups. However, because psychiatric
comorbidities were more common in the patients receiving VPA, this is likely to be weighted heavier in the VPA
users and is thus unlikely to explain the observed results of
a decreased incidence of head and neck cancer. Given that
the risk for COPD, another closely linked smoking1398

related disease, was identical between VPA users and nonusers (Table 1), the cumulative smoking histories were
most likely comparable.
Noncompliance with a medical regimen could have
been a source of bias. Compliance is always a concern,
particularly in patients with mental illness. The data from
the current study demonstrated that the reduction in head
and neck cancer risk in patients with a subtherapeutic median VPA level was less evident. Thus it is possible that
the inclusion of patients with poor medication compliance in the group exposed to VPA may have made the
association less prominent.
Finally, evidence is emerging that the risk of
smoking-related cancers may be dependent on certain genotypes of nicotine- and carcinogen-metabolizing
enzymes such as cytochrome P450 2A6 and others.38,39
The nature of the current study does not grant us detailed
knowledge of these genotypes. However, given the finding
that the risk of other smoking-related malignancies such
as lung and bladder cancer is unaffected by VPA exposure,
it is unlikely that significant imbalances in the genotypes
of these metabolizing enzymes are responsible for the
observed risk reduction in head and neck cancer.
A mechanistic explanation for why SCCs of the head
and neck are more susceptible to prevention by VPA is not
straightforward, but recent whole-genome sequencing, genotyping, methylation, and gene expression projects have
Cancer

May 1, 2014

Reduced HNC Risk After VPA Use/Kang et al

provided a wealth of information implicating epigenetic
events, particularly in patients with aerodigestive SCCs.
Whole-genome sequencing in patients with SCCs of the
head and neck and lung identified frequent mutations and
amplifications of the Histone-lysine N-methyltransferases
PRDM9 and EZH2 in both malignancies in up to 20% of
the cases.40,41 Recent whole-genome approaches have
revealed defects in 4 driver pathways in patients with head
and neck cancer: mitogenic signaling, cell cycle control,
p53 signaling, and NOTCH signaling.42 All these pathways are potentially affected by epigenetic changes: p16 is
not expressed in the vast majority of non–HPV-related
head and neck cancers. In > 50% of the cases, p16 is
silenced epigenetically by promoter methylation.43
Although p53 is mutated in > 80% of head and neck cancers, even those tumors without mutation frequently demonstrate loss of expression. One potential mechanism for
this is epigenetic silencing of p14, which shares a bidirectional promoter with p16 and controls the activity of the
ubiquitin-protein ligase Mouse double minute 2 homolog
(MDM2), which targets p53 for proteasomal degradation.44 Notch signaling in patients with head and neck cancer has a predominantly tumor-suppressive effect. It is
possible that the upregulation of NOTCH1 after treatment
with HDAC inhibitors can be an additional mechanism of
tumor suppression.45,46 Finally, a recent study analyzing
the DNA methylation pattern of head and neck cancers
identified a subset of tumors with a hypermethylator phenotype, similar to the previously described CpG island
methylator phenotype (CIMP) observed among patients
with colon cancer.47 The question of whether this subset of
patients with head and neck cancer is particularly sensitive
to the effects of epigenetic therapies will need to be
explored.42 Although the precise underlying molecular
events for these observations need to be unraveled, the data
from the current study have provided epidemiologic support for the susceptibility of head and neck cancers to the
effects of HDAC inhibitors.
Although the anticancer effects of HDAC inhibitors
against HPV-related malignancies have been described in
vitro,35 the current study data have demonstrated that
VPA use does not preferentially decrease the risk of cancers of the oropharynx, which account for the majority of
HPV-related cases,32-34 thereby making an antiviral effect
of VPA unlikely as the primary contributor to the
observed decrease in head and neck cancer incidence, at
least in patients with smoking history.
The long-term use of VPA is associated with a
decreased risk of head and neck cancers in high-risk veterans. The extensive preclinical and clinical evidence and

the magnitude of the observed potential benefit warrant
further investigation of VPA as a cancer chemoprevention
agent, possibly in patients with premalignant lesions of
the head and neck.
