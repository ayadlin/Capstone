Abstract
NOTCH signaling is critical for specifying the intestinal epithelial cell lineage and for initiating colorectal
adenomas and colorectal cancers (CRC). Based on evidence that NOTCH is important for the maintenance and
self-renewal of cancer-initiating cells in other malignancies, we studied the role of NOTCH signaling in colon
cancer–initiating cells (CCIC). Tumors formed by CCICs maintain many properties of the primary CRCs from
which they were derived, such as glandular organization, cell polarity, gap junctions, and expression of characteristic CRC molecular markers. Furthermore, CCICs have the property of self-renewal. In this study, we
show that NOTCH signaling is 10- to 30-fold higher in CCIC compared with widely used colon cancer cell lines.
Using small-molecule inhibition and short hairpin RNA knockdown, we show that NOTCH prevents CCIC
apoptosis through repression of cell cycle kinase inhibitor p27 and transcription factor ATOH1. NOTCH is also
critical to intrinsic maintenance of CCIC self-renewal and the repression of secretory cell lineage differentiation genes such as MUC2. Our findings describe a novel human cell system to study NOTCH signaling in CRC
tumor initiation and suggest that inhibition of NOTCH signaling may improve CRC chemoprevention and chemotherapy. Cancer Res; 70(4); 1469–78. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of
U.S. cancer death (1). For metastatic CRC, the 5-year survival rate is ∼10% (1). A mechanistic understanding of
CRC initiation, recurrence, and metastasis is therefore an
important goal. Several studies have shown that WNT and
NOTCH pathways help maintain intestinal homeostasis, regulate cell fate decisions, and play important roles in CRC
tumorigenesis and progression (2–8). The majority of CRC
tumors have increased WNT signaling (9). In normal intestinal homeostasis, WNT signaling stimulates intestinal stem
and progenitor cell proliferation but paradoxically also
causes terminal differentiation into Paneth cells. One might
therefore expect that CRC cells would attempt to differentiate terminally into Paneth cells. However, other signaling
pathways active in CRC prevent terminal differentiation and
maintain self-renewal capacity. A candidate is the NOTCH
signaling pathway.

The role of NOTCH signaling in CRC is less well characterized than WNT. NOTCH signaling is triggered through
the binding of a ligand on the membrane of one cell
(Delta/Delta-like/Jagged/Serrate) to a receptor (NOTCH1/
NOTCH2/NOTCH3/NOTCH4) on the membrane of the contacting cell. This causes proteolytic cleavage of NOTCH
receptors to release the cytoplasmic tail of NOTCH (NICD;
ref. 10). NICD translocates to the nucleus and associates
with CSL transcription factors (CBF1/RBPJκ/Suppressor of
Hairless/Lag-1) and coactivator Mastermind to turn on
transcription of target genes (11). The best-characterized
targets of NOTCH are hairy/enhancer of split (HES) family
of transcription factors, particularly HES1 in the intestine
(12, 13). In normal mouse intestine, inhibition of NOTCH
signaling results in exit from the proliferative compartment
and differentiation into postmitotic goblet cells (7). Similar
results are seen in knockouts of other critical NOTCH signal
transduction components, including Hes1, Rbpjκ, Notch 1
and 2 receptors, and Pofut1 knockouts for normal intestine
(6–8, 12, 14). Apc mutant intestinal adenoma cells, which
have elevated WNT signaling, also respond to NOTCH
signaling inhibition by terminal differentiation into goblet
cells, accompanied by cell cycle arrest and/or apoptosis
(7, 15). Therefore, suppression of NOTCH signaling is a
powerful mechanism for directing both normal intestinal
enterocyte progenitors and Apc mutant intestinal cancer
cells to differentiate down a secretory lineage.
NOTCH signaling plays an important role in intestinal
tumor initiation but not progression in mice (15). Transgenic
expression of NICD in the intestine leads to expansion of
enterocyte progenitor cells (6) and increases the number of

adenomas in ApcMin mice (15). In addition, inhibition of
NOTCH by Jag1 deletion decreases adenoma initiation in
ApcMin mice (16). In human CRCs, NOTCH signaling is high
in adenomas and early-stage CRCs (16, 17) but low in advanced, later-stage, and metastatic CRCs (15). The molecular
mechanisms that cause NOTCH signaling to be important for
early-stage CRC initiation are not understood, and dramatically fewer mechanistic studies of NOTCH signaling in human CRC cell lines have been performed. Pharmacologic
and small interfering RNA–mediated NOTCH signaling inhibition in colon cancer cell lines in vitro enhances sensitivity
to cytotoxic chemotherapy. However, in the absence of cytotoxic chemotherapy, endogenous NOTCH signaling levels are

present but generally low (18–20). In summary, although
NOTCH signaling seems to be very important in adenoma
formation and CRC tumorigenesis, the relatively low endogenous signaling levels in many commonly used CRC cell lines
have limited mechanistic studies of NOTCH signaling in
human CRC cells that could provide important insights
into better ways to improve CRC chemoprevention and
chemotherapy.
Colon cancer–initiating cells (CCIC; refs. 21–24) maintain

typical for CRC, such as cytokeratin 20 (CK20) or carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), which are often not highly expressed
in commonly used CRC cell lines typically used for in vitro
studies (21, 23, 24). CCICs have the property of self-renewal
(25) and can form new tumors after serial transplantation
(21, 23, 24). Because previous studies have shown that
NOTCH signaling plays a role in T-cell leukemia (26) and
breast (27), brain (28–30), and pancreatic (31) cancer CIC,
we studied NOTCH signaling in CCIC. Here, we show that
NOTCH signaling is markedly higher in CCIC compared with
commonly used CRC cell lines and plays important roles in
the intrinsic maintenance of CCIC viability, tumor formation,
self-renewal, and the alternate expression of enterocyte or
secretory intestinal cell lineage differentiation markers.
These data describe a novel human CRC cell system to study
NOTCH signaling in CRC tumor initiation, and they suggest
that inhibition of NOTCH signaling is likely to be an important mechanism to improve CRC chemoprevention and
chemotherapy.

Materials and Methods
Isolation and culture of CCIC. Human colon cancer samples were obtained from colon cancer resections and liver
metastasis under protocols approved by the University of
California-Irvine Institutional Review Board. Fresh CRC tissue was extensively washed with PBS, minced, and incubated at 37°C with collagenase. Cells were then strained
through 40-μm filter and used for in vitro culture or xenograft. CCIC cultures were derived essentially as described
previously (22) and cultured as spheres in ultralow-attachment flasks in DMEM/F12 containing nonessential amino
acids, antibiotic-antimycotic, N2 supplement (Invitrogen),
B27 supplement (Invitrogen), heparin (4 μg/mL; Sigma), epidermal growth factor (40 ng/mL), and basic fibroblast
growth factor (20 ng/mL) at 37°C and 5% CO2. For xenograft assays, primary tumor cells or CCICs were injected
in nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient
(NOD/SCID) mice s.c. as a 1:1 mixture of Matrigel and

CCIC medium. For DAPT treatment, cells were treated
with 10 μmol/L DAPT (EMD Biosciences) or DMSO for
48 h and used for cell cycle analysis and Western blotting.
For three-dimensional culture of CCIC, single CCICs were
mixed with 2.5 mg/mL collagen (BD Biosciences) and 7.5%
Matrigel (BD Biosciences) and plated in Transwell dishes
overlaid with medium.
Culture of colon cancer cell lines. HCT116, DLD1, HT29,
and SW480 were purchased from the American Type Culture
Collection and cultured according to recommended medium
conditions at 37°C and 5% CO2.
Lentiviral constructs and infection. The lentiviral vectors
pLKO.1-puro, pLKO.1-scrambled-shRNA (Addgene), and
pLKO.1-shRNA that targets RBPJκ (TRCN0000016203, Sigma)
were transfected into 293T cells along with pCMV and pMP2G.
Lentiviral RBPJκ/NOTCH reporter was purchased as a prepackaged lentivirus from SA Biosciences. CCICs and colon
cancer cell lines were infected with lentivirus at a multiplicity
of infection of 50 in the presence of polybrene (1 μg/mL) and
selected in puromycin according to the manufacturer's protocol and similar to previous studies (32, 33). Concentrations for
puromycin selection were determined by plotting a kill curve.
Mock-infected cells did not survive puromycin selection. Stable cell lines were then used for fluorescence-activated cell
sorting (FACS) analysis to assay for NOTCH reporter activity.
Flow cytometry. Flow cytometry was performed on single
CCIC with CD133 antibody (Miltenyi Biotec), CD44 (BD Pharmingen), and ESA (Biomedia). Enzyme assay for ALDH1 was
performed using the Aldeflour kit (Stem Cell Technologies).
For reporter assays, stable CCICs with reporter were analyzed for green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression. For
cell cycle analysis, CCICs were fixed and stained with propidium iodide and then analyzed on a Becton Dickinson flow
cytometer.
Immunohistochemistry. Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence were performed on paraffin-embedded
sections from xenografts and three-dimensional cultures as
previously described (34). β-Catenin immunocytochemistry
was performed on four CCIC lines to evaluate subcellular

and Methods.
Gene expression profiling. Expression profiling was
carried out using total RNA from two CCIC lines in quadruplicates on Affymetrix GeneChip Human Exon 1.0 ST Array.
The Cyber-T program was used to determine statistically
significant, differentially expressed genes compared with
normal colon data sets (35). Differentially regulated genes
were analyzed by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. Expression
data were confirmed by Taqman in four CCIC lines (including the two that were profiled).
Protein isolation and Western blotting. Protein isolation
and Western blot analysis were carried out as previously
described (34). Antibodies are listed in Supplementary

RNA isolation and quantitative reverse transcriptionPCR. Total RNA was extracted using Qiagen RNeasy kit
and reverse transcribed, and gene expression was quantified
on ABI PRISM HT7900. Expression levels are an average of
three independent experiments in two CCIC lines. All expression levels are normalized to GAPDH and RPLPO.

1472

pathways for human CRCs, we derived CCIC from colon cancers resected from 10 patients (Supplementary Table S1). In
agreement with other groups, we found that CCIC can form
xenografts in NOD/SCID mice that maintain the histopathology of primary human CRCs (21, 23, 24, 36). CK20 and CEA
are CRC peptide markers commonly used in routine anatomic pathology studies of human CRC patient tumors. Xenografts derived from injection of CCIC in NOD/SCID mice
are CK20 and CEA positive and CK7 negative (matching
the marker pattern most commonly seen in patient CRC specimens; Fig. 1A). At the same time, commonly used CRC cell
lines that form tumors in xenograft assays do not recapitulate the glandular architecture, maintain cell polarity, or express the immunohistochemical markers for CRC typically
used to confirm colonic origin in primary and metastatic
CRC specimens (Supplementary Fig. S1A).
CD133, CD44, ESA, and ALDH1 have previously been
shown to be important CCIC markers (21, 23, 24, 36). As expected, FACS analysis showed that the CCICs we derived also
express CD133, CD44, ESA, and ALDH1 (Fig. 1B). To evaluate
CCIC capacity for self-renewal, we injected CCIC spheres in
the flank of NOD/SCID mice at regular intervals to assay its
tumor-forming ability. As expected, the CCICs we derived
faithfully maintain the histology and marker expression in
xenograft assays over multiple passages (Fig. 1C). To date,
we have tested up to six passages of CCIC lines that have
maintained self-renewal capacity for more than 1 year.

NOTCH in Colon Cancer–Initiating Cells

Consistent with previous studies (37), single CCIC cells can
form carcinomatous glands in collagen three-dimensional
culture in vitro. Like the xenografts, the cells in these colonies
maintain architectural features typical of differentiated CRC,
including the formation of gland lumens and the expression
of typical CK7−/CK20+ cytokeratin pattern seen in bona fide
primary CRC (Fig. 1D). Some of the cells also have nuclear βcatenin staining indicative of elevated WNT signaling seen in
CRCs (Fig. 1D). In contrast, commonly used CRC cell lines in
three-dimensional culture (Supplementary Fig. S1B) form
solid nests of unpolarized cells that lack signs of glandular
organization and other features of colon differentiation.
Elevated WNT and NOTCH signaling in CCIC as compared with normal colon tissue. The molecular mechanisms
that sustain CCIC are poorly characterized. To explore critical biological pathways regulating CCIC, we generated gene
expression profiles using Affymetrix whole-genome exon arrays and compared them with normal colon profiles. The differentially expressed genes were then used in Ingenuity
Pathway Analysis to identify functional categories and signaling pathways that are enriched. Because of their relevance to
CRC and other CIC types, we focused on WNT and NOTCH
signaling. Similar to previous studies showing high levels of
WNT signaling in commonly used CRC cell lines, WNT targets
such as MYC, CD44, CTNNB1, LEF1, TLE4, and CD44 are all
expressed at significantly higher levels in CCIC compared
with normal colon (Supplementary Table S2). These data
are also consistent with the presence of nuclear β-catenin
protein seen in CCIC in vitro cultures, which is seen in approximately 50% to 90% of CCIC. Similarly, canonical NOTCH
target genes, such as HES1, HES4, and HES6, and signaling
components, such as JAG1, JAG2, and NOTCH1, were all
significantly higher in CCIC (Supplementary Table S2). To
validate the array data for NOTCH components and targets,
we performed quantitative PCR analysis in CCIC derived
from nine CCIC lines. In the CCIC lines tested, the canonical
NOTCH target gene HES1 and pathway components JAG1 and
NOTCH1 are significantly higher compared with normal
colon epithelium (Fig. 2). In summary, CCICs have elevated
levels of WNT and NOTCH target genes and signaling components compared with normal colon tissue.

CCICs have active NOTCH signaling. Because our gene
expression analyses were exploratory and normal colon tissue was not cultured in the same way as CCIC (which could
confound data interpretation), we used NOTCH reporter constructs to test directly whether CCICs have active NOTCH
signaling. We infected CCIC and commonly used CRC cell
lines with a lentiviral NOTCH GFP reporter construct for direct comparison. FACS analysis of CCIC showed high levels
of NOTCH activity. Even in CCIC lines that are far from the
highest in endogenous NOTCH target gene expression (such
as CCIC-1, second bar series in Fig. 2C), >33% of the cells
have active NOTCH signaling as indicated by high GFP expression (Fig. 3A). However, commonly used colon cancer
cell lines have little (SW480) to no active NOTCH signaling
(HCT116, DLD1, and Colo320; all ≤3% of cells; Supplementary
Fig. S2). In summary, CCICs have approximately 10- to 30fold more cells with high levels of NOTCH signaling than
commonly used colon cancer cell lines. Similar results
were seen with studies using a NOTCH signaling luciferase
reporter gene (data not shown).
γ-Secretase is a critical component of NOTCH signal transduction at the cell membrane. DAPT is a γ-secretase inhibitor that inhibits NOTCH signaling by blocking the γ-secretase
complex responsible for the S3 cleavage to release the NICD
domain (38). To further validate that CCICs have elevated
NOTCH signaling, we transiently treated CCIC with DAPT.
Consistent with inhibition of NOTCH signaling, DAPT caused
a ≥50% reduction in the number of GFP+ CCIC (Fig. 3A). To
investigate if active NOTCH signaling is present in CCIC in
three-dimensional culture, we performed immunofluorescence for NICD with an antibody that recognizes NICD. NICD
staining is seen in the nucleus of CCIC in three-dimensional
in vitro cultures, indicating active NOTCH signaling (Fig. 3B).
γ-Secretase inhibitors induce goblet cell lineage
markers and cause apoptosis in CCICs. Because NOTCH
signaling is active in CCIC, we tested whether NOTCH is required for CCIC tumor formation. CCICs treated with DAPT
had no NICD detectable by Western blot analysis (Fig. 4A,
right). Similarly, DAPT-treated CCICs downregulated NOTCH
targets HES1 and HES5 (Fig. 4A, left). In the mouse intestine,
Hes1 represses Atoh1, a bHLH transcription factor that

promotes intestinal stem cell differentiation toward secretory lineages (39). DAPT treatment of CCIC increases expression of ATOH1 and expression of goblet cell marker MUC2
(40, 41), likely caused by lower HES1 levels (Fig. 4B).
In addition, in the mouse intestine, Hes1 represses transcription of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors p27/
CDKN1B and p57/CDKN1C and arrests intestinal progenitor
cells that differentiate down the goblet cell lineage (8). Quantitative PCR analysis of human CCIC shows that NOTCH
pathway inhibition with DAPT relieves repression of p27
but not p57 (Fig. 4B; data not shown). In addition, we treated
CCIC that had been cultured in three-dimensional collagen
matrix for 7 to 10 days and had already formed adenocarcinomatous glands. Consistent with studies of NOTCH inhibitors in Apc mice where NOTCH inhibition causes Apc mutant
intestinal adenoma cells to differentiate terminally into postmitotic goblet cells (7, 15), DAPT increased the number of
MUC2-immunoreactive cells in previously formed CCIC
glands (Fig. 4C; Supplementary Fig. S3).
Next, we examined if NOTCH signaling is required at earlier stage for CCIC to initiate three-dimensional culture tumor formation. Single CCICs plated in three-dimensional
culture and treated with DAPT could no longer form adenocarcinomatous glands but only disorganized CCIC clusters
that were MUC2 negative and had no self-renewal capacity

1474

(Fig. 5A). In contrast, DAPT did not affect proliferation and
colony formation in HCT116 cells, which have low levels of
NOTCH signaling (Supplementary Fig. S4). To test if NOTCH
inhibition causes CCIC to undergo apoptosis, we treated
CCIC in nonadherent cultures with DAPT and performed cell
cycle analysis. FACS analysis showed an increase in the subG1 population, indicating that CCICs were undergoing apoptosis (Fig. 5B). To further validate whether DAPT induces
CCIC apoptosis, we performed Western blots for cleaved caspase-3. DAPT increased cleaved caspase-3 in CCIC, consistent with a triggered apoptosis response (Fig. 5C). In
summary, human CCICs in both nonadherent and three-dimensional culture have active NOTCH signaling and express
markers of NOTCH signaling such as nuclear NICD, HES1,
and HES5. NOTCH signaling is maintained in CCIC adenocarcinomatous glands in three-dimensional culture and express
CRC markers such as CK20 and CEA. Treatment with the
NOTCH inhibitor DAPT induces CCIC apoptosis and eliminates the CCIC capacity for self-renewal and formation of
new tumors.
Knockdown of RBPJκ leads to expression of goblet cell
markers and a decrease in enterocyte markers and tumor
foci. DAPT inhibits γ-secretase, which acts on NOTCH
as well as other signal transduction pathways in the cell
(42, 43). To test whether inhibition of NOTCH signaling

specifically causes CCIC to express goblet cell differentiation
markers and initiate apoptosis, we transduced CCICs with a
lentivirus expressing short hairpin RNA (shRNA) for the critical NOTCH effector RBPJκ/CBF1/CSL. Quantitative PCR and
Western blot analysis confirmed efficient knockdown of
RBPJκ (Fig. 6A, left and middle). Consistent with NOTCH inhibition, RBPJκ knockdown decreased RBPJκ/NOTCH target
gene HES1 (Fig. 6A, left). Quantitative PCR analysis showed
that RBPJκ knockdown led to increased expression of ATOH1
and the goblet cell marker MUC2 (Fig. 6A, right). CK20, a
marker of the enterocyte lineage, decreases consistent with
the effect of inhibiting NOTCH signaling (Fig. 6A, right).
In addition, as seen with DAPT treatment, RBPJκ shRNA
knockdown relieved repression of the cell cycle inhibitor
p27 but not p57 (Fig. 6A, right). In summary, the effect of

RBPJκ knockdown on the expression of target genes in CCIC
is essentially the same as blocking NOTCH signaling pharmacologically with DAPT. Likewise, effects on colon cell marker
expression are consistent with changes induced by NOTCH
pathway inhibition in the mouse intestine.
To analyze if RBPJκ knockdown affects CCIC tumor focus
formation in three-dimensional culture, we plated cells transduced with either shRNA for RBPJκ or a scrambled control
and selected for puromycin-resistant colonies. Cells expressing shRNA against RBPJκ-infected cells were unable to form
colonies as compared with control (Fig. 6B). To test whether
RBPJκ knockdown induced apoptosis in CCIC, we performed
cell cycle analysis. Cell cycle analysis revealed that, up to 4
days after infection, the scrambled and RBPJ knockdown
populations had similar FACS profiles (Fig. 6C). However,

after 4 days, a sub-G1 peak starts appearing only in the RBPJκ
knockdown population, consistent with apoptosis. At 8 days
after infection, 60% of RBPJκ knockdown cells undergo
apoptosis, and by 15 days, this number increases to 90%
(Fig. 6C). Cleaved caspase-3 also increases post-RBPJκ knockdown, confirming that the cells are apoptotic (Fig. 6D). In
summary, these data are consistent with a requirement for
NOTCH signaling for CCIC survival (due to suppression of
apoptosis), proliferation, and subsequent tumor formation
and self-renewal.

Discussion
Previous work has shown that NOTCH signaling is highly
active in cancer-initiating cells in human T-cell leukemia, gliomas, medulloblastoma, and pancreatic cancers (26, 28, 29,
31). Here, we show that NOTCH signaling is also highly active
in human CCIC. NOTCH signaling is significantly higher than
commonly used CRC cell lines, with an approximately 10- to
30-fold increase in the number of cells with active NOTCH
signaling (Fig. 3; Supplementary Fig. S2). NOTCH therefore
plays an important role in the intrinsic maintenance of CCIC
viability, tumor formation, self-renewal, and the alternate
expression of enterocyte (HES1, HES5, CK20, and CEA) or
secretory cell lineage (MUC2 and ATOH1) differentiation
markers (Figs. 4 and 6; Supplementary Fig. S3).
In serum-free nonadherent culture conditions, where
CCICs have minimal expression of intestinal enterocyte/secretory lineage differentiation marker genes (44) and are in
a more “stem cell/early progenitor–like” state, NOTCH signaling is highly active and suppresses both CCIC apoptosis and
cell cycle arrest (Figs. 4 and 6). Inhibition of NOTCH signaling
activates the intrinsic apoptosis pathway, causing cleavage of
caspase-3 (Figs. 5 and 6). Additionally, repression of NOTCH
signaling inhibits CK20 expression and increases expression
of ATOH1 (which causes secretory lineage–committed intestinal cells to exit the cell cycle) and the CDK inhibitor p27/
CDKN1B, which causes cell cycle arrest. Repression of
NOTCH does not affect p57/CDKN1C expression. In normal
mouse intestine, NOTCH inhibition causes derepression of
Atoh1, p27, and p57. In this context, individual p27 and p57
knockouts have little effect and knockout of both p27 and
p57 are required for the conversion of enterocyte progenitors
into postmitotic goblet cells (8). Therefore, the effect of
NOTCH inhibition to arrest human CCIC but not affect p57
levels seems to reflect a lack of redundancy between p27 and
p57 or a different mechanistic requirement for cell cycle inhibitors than that used in normal mouse intestine. Future experiments to study NOTCH inhibition in cultured normal
human intestinal stem cells and Apc+/−;p27−/−;p57−/− intestinal tumors may help to resolve whether this difference is
due to species (human versus mouse) or cell type (CCIC
versus normal intestinal stem cells).
In three-dimensional solid-phase culture conditions, individual CCICs form tumor foci. Under these conditions, CCICs
express differentiated enterocyte lineage markers such as
HES1 and CK20. In this system, endogenous NOTCH signaling
suppresses goblet cell differentiation markers and promotes

1476

proliferation. NOTCH inhibition decreases the number of
CCICs expressing CK20 and simultaneously increases CCICs
expressing secretory lineage markers such as MUC2. Overall,
our data in CCIC are consistent with mouse studies showing
that blocking NOTCH in the context of overactive WNT
signaling can cause mouse intestinal cancer cells expressing
enterocyte lineage markers to transdifferentiate into postmitotic goblet cells and reduce tumor growth (7, 16). Functionally, NOTCH inhibition causes CCIC to initiate apoptosis and
to lose the capacity to form tumors and the property of selfrenewal. An interesting aspect of CCIC with NOTCH inhibition by either RBPJκ knockdown or DAPT treatment in
three-dimensional culture is that the cells expressing secretory differentiation markers, such as MUC2, are always seen
individually surrounded by CK20+ cells and not adjacent to
one another (Fig. 4C; data not shown). In multiple metazoan
developmental systems ranging from Drosophila to mice,
NOTCH signaling is thought to be mediated by ligand-receptor cell-cell interactions, whereby a cell that is beginning to
differentiate prevents its neighbors from differentiating in
the same way at the same time by “lateral inhibition.” Therefore, future studies of CCICs in three-dimensional culture
may help our understanding of the mechanistic roles of
NOTCH signal transduction components in the process of
lateral inhibition of differentiation, with particular focus on
the intestinal cell lineages and gland formation.
In the mouse, overexpression of NOTCH signaling alone
does not cause intestinal tumor formation. However, activation of both WNT and NOTCH pathways, such as in Apc mutant mouse intestine, increases the number of adenomas that
initiate compared with WNT activation alone. In the context
of inhibited WNT signaling (such as Tcf4−/− mice), NOTCH activation is not sufficient to initiate tumors (15). Human
CCICs have high levels of both WNT and NOTCH signaling.
Similar to the studies in mice and commonly used CRC cell
lines, blocking WNT activity in CCIC (such as by expression
of the WNT inhibitor DKK1) significantly inhibits the number
and size of CCIC tumors that form (Supplementary Fig. S5).
In the context of WNT inhibition, however, CCIC viability and
proliferation is sufficiently impaired that we cannot readily
study the effect of combined WNT/NOTCH inhibition on expression of enterocyte or secretory lineage differentiation
markers because of extensive cell cycle arrest and apoptosis.
In summary, consistent with mouse and commonly used human CRC cell line studies, our data in CCIC indicate that
high NOTCH activity is insufficient to allow CCIC to overcome WNT inhibition.
Overall, our results in human CCIC are largely consistent
with the mouse phenotypes observed when NOTCH signaling is blocked (7, 8). CCICs maintain the capacity to express
differentiation markers of multiple lineages and depend on
self-renewal pathways such as NOTCH. It is possible that
in human colon, active NOTCH signaling is required in
the initial stages of tumor formation. In the absence of
NOTCH signaling, a colon enterocyte progenitor cell with
active WNT signaling would undergo terminal differentiation and not give rise to an adenoma, similar to mouse
model studies (15).

NOTCH in Colon Cancer–Initiating Cells

Epidemiologic, preclinical, and clinical studies show that
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID), such as sulindac, are effective in decreasing the number of colon adenomas that initiate in patients (45–48). Two direct targets of
NSAIDs are of cyclooxygenase (COX) 1 and COX2 enzymes.
However, other targets of sulindac may also play a role in
inhibition of CRC. For example, a recent study showed that
amide derivatives of sulindac that do not inhibit COX1 or
COX2 can inhibit CRC cell line growth (49). In parallel, clinical trials of sulindac sulfide and other NSAIDs are also being
performed to block the formation of β-amyloid plaques in
Alzheimer disease patients (50). The proposed mechanism
of action for NSAIDs to inhibit β-amyloid plaque formation
is through inhibition of the γ-secretase complex (50). In cell
culture and mice, sulindac inhibits cleavage of NOTCH receptors (50). Therefore, it is tempting to speculate that (in addition to COX1/2 inhibition) an important mechanism of
NSAID colon adenoma chemopreventive activity is the inhi-

bition of the γ-secretase complex and NOTCH signaling
in CCICs as they arise in the colon. In the future, it will be
important to conduct correlative studies of NOTCH signaling
inhibition in NSAID colon adenoma chemoprevention trials
to address this question.
