ABSTRACT
Metformin and the mitochondrial targeting dichloroacetate (DCA) have recently
received attention due to their ability to inhibit anaerobic glycolysis, which renders
most cancer cells resistant to apoptosis induction. We observed that Metformin alone
exhibited a dose-dependent anti-leukemic activity in both B leukemic cell lines and
primary B-chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) patients’ cells and its anti-leukemic
activity was enhanced when used in combination with DCA. In order to overcome
the problems of poor bioavailability and cellular uptake, which limit DCA efficacy, we
have designed and synthetized cocrystals consisting of Metformin and DCA (Met-DCA)
at different stoichiometric ratios. Of note, the MetH2++•2DCA− cocrystal exhibited
enhanced in vitro anti-leukemic activity, with respect to the treatment with the mix
consisting of Metformin plus DCA. In particular, the treatment with the cocrystal
MetH2++•2DCA− induced a synergistic apoptotic cell death coupled to a marked downmodulation of the anti-apoptotic Mcl-1 protein. Taken together, our data emphasize
that innovative compounds based on Metformin-DCA combination merit to be further
evaluated as chemotherapeutic agents for the treatment of B-CLL.

[8] and in particular, for the purpose of this study, against
B-chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) cells [9, 10].
Among the great variety of anti-cancer drugs, another
inexpensive and safe drug, which has recently revealed a
potential anti-leukemic activity, is Metformin [11-14].
This molecule represents the most commonly prescribed
drug for type 2 diabetes mellitus [11]. Anyhow, in recent
years, multiple lines of evidence have provided support
for the hypothesis that treatment with Metformin results in
decreased incidence, progression, and mortality of different
human cancers. Moreover, a number of in vitro studies
have documented the antiproliferative, anti-invasive, and
antimetastatic effects of Metformin in multiple cancer cell
types [15-18]. Interestingly, DCA and Metformin share
several mechanisms, potentially involved in their anticancer
activity, by disrupting mitochondrial respiratory chain
complex and decreasing the ATP synthesis [19].

INTRODUCTION
Most cancers are characterized by enhanced
glycolytic flux for ATP production, enhanced glucose to
lactate conversion and reduced mitochondrial oxidative
phosphorylation, even under aerobic conditions [1-3].
Interestingly, this cancer-specific metabolic remodeling
can be reversed by dichloroacetate (DCA), a mitochondriatargeting small molecule able to penetrate most tissues after
oral administration [4]. DCA is a generic drug with low
price, which has been used for human treatments for more
than 30 years and has received renovated attention because
of interesting preclinical antitumoral characteristics, assessed
in solid tumor cell lines [4-7], and relatively low toxicity
on normal cells. Some recent studies of our and other
groups have demonstrated that DCA is also effective against
hematological malignancies, such as multiple myeloma

On these bases, the aim of the present study was
to evaluate the potential therapeutic perspectives of
Metformin plus DCA as innovative anti-leukemic drug
combination. Herein, we have evaluated the in vitro effects
of Metformin used alone and in combination with DCA
on B-leukemic cells, including primary B-CLL patient
cells, by assessing cell viability, cell cycle progression,
apoptosis, as well as the expression of apoptotic signaling
modulators. Of note, to improve the efficacy of the
drug combination, we have designed, synthetized and
functionally validated Metformin-DCA cocrystals.

consisting of cocrystals of Metformin and DCA in different
stoichiometric ratios: MetH+•DCA− (1:1; Figure 3A) and
MetH2++•2DCA− (1:2; Figure 3B). When tested on leukemic
cell lines and B-CLL patient derived primary cells, these
compounds exhibited in vitro anti-leukemic activity. In
particular, maximal cytotoxic effects were observed when
cell cultures were treated with the cocrystal MetH2++•2DCA−
(from now on, named Met-DCA cocrystal), which
exhibited an enhanced (p<0.05) activity with respect to the
treatment with a mix of the two reference drugs, used at
the appropriate concentrations (Figure 4). Analysis of the
cell cycle profile (Figure 5A) revealed that the cytotoxicity
induced by the treatment with the Met-DCA cocrystal was
effective in increasing the cytostatic effect induced by DCA
(id, accumulation in G1 phase and reduction in S phase
of the cell cycle). Moreover, the Met-DCA cocrystal was
particularly effective as pro-apoptotic molecule resulting in
a significant (p<0.05) increase of the degree of apoptosis
with respect to the treatment with Metformin and DCA used
as single agents (Figure 5B-5C). Of note, the pro-apoptotic
effects of the Met-DCA cocrystal were significantly
(p<0.05) higher also with respect to the treatment with the
mix of Metformin plus DCA (Figure 5B-5C).

RESULTS
Metformin promotes cytotoxicity in B leukemic
cell lines and in primary B-CLL cells
In the first set of experiments, we have evaluated
the in vitro effect of Metformin on B leukemic cell lines
(EHEB and JVM-2), as well as on primary B-CLL patient
cell samples. All leukemic cells were characterized
by having a p53wild-type status, a feature typical of the
majority of the B-CLL at diagnosis [20-25]. Treatment
with Metformin exhibited a dose- and time-dependent
cytotoxicity on both B-leukemic cell lines (Figure 1A) as
well as on B-CLL patient cell cultures (Figure 1B). Of
note, the IC50 mean values (±SD) calculated after 48 hours
of treatment in B leukemic cell lines (11.58±0.77 mM)
and B-CLL patient derived cell cultures (10.17±1.04 mM)
were comparable.

The Met-DCA cocrystal-induced cell death is
accompanied by Mcl-1 down-regulation
In order to evaluate the molecular basis explaining
the antitumoral effects of the Met-DCA cocrystal, after in
vitro treatments, we have analyzed the expression profile
of intracellular effectors known to stimulate/suppress
leukemic cell survival. In particular, considering previous
studies on the molecular effects of Metformin, alone or in
combination with other therapeutic compounds, in solid
tumor cell models and in multiple myeloma cells [28-30],
we have first investigated the expression levels of Mcl-1.
Of note, Mcl-1 is one of the most important anti-apoptotic
Bcl-2 family member, which induces CLL cell survival
and therefore is associated with CLL response to the
treatments and disease progression [31, 32]. As shown in
Figure 6, in our experimental models, Mcl-1 protein levels
were significantly decreased upon 24 hours of treatment
with the combination of Metformin plus DCA. Of interest,
maximal down-regulation was observed by treatment with
the Met-DCA cocrystal (Figure 6). It has to be underlined
that the down-modulation of Mcl-1, coupled to the
induction of apoptosis, in response to Met-DCA cocrystal
was documented not only in B leukemic cells with a
p53wild-type status, but also in the B lymphoblastoid cell line
MEC-2 harboring mutated p53 (Figure 7). Conversely, the
levels of the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein did not change
upon drug treatments neither in p53wild-type (Figure 6) nor
in p53mutated cells (Figure 7).
In the next experiments, we have analyzed Mcl-1
protein levels at early time points upon drug exposure. As
shown in Figure 8A, Mcl-1 down-modulation was evident

Anti-leukemic activity of Metformin plus DCA
and of Met-DCA cocrystals
Starting from our recent studies documenting
anti leukemic activity of DCA towards B-CLL [9, 10],
in the next group of experiments we have explored the
potentiality of using Metformin in combination with
DCA. B-CLL cells were treated with Metformin and DCA
(used in the range of 0.1-20 mM) as single agents and in
combination. In particular, leukemic cells were treated
with serial concentrations of Metformin and DCA at a
constant Metformin:DCA ratio (either 1:1 or 1:2) for data
analysis by the method of Chou and Talalay [26]. Combined
treatment with Metformin plus DCA, at 1:2 ratio, resulted
in significantly (p<0.05) enhanced cytotoxicity with respect
to the single agents in both B leukemic cell lines as well
as in primary B-CLL patient samples (Figure 2A), with a
synergistic effect (Figure 2B) documented by an average
Combination Index (CI) value <1. On the other hand, no
significant cytotoxicity was observed in normal peripheral
blood cells exposed to the single drugs, confirming
literature data [9, 27], as well as to the Metformin plus DCA
combination (Figure 2A). Starting from these results and
considering that DCA molecule exhibits poor bioavailability
and cellular uptake, we have synthetized new molecules

already after 3-5 hours of treatment with the Met-DCA
cocrystal, well before the onset of apoptosis. In parallel,
since in different cancer cells Mcl-1 is induced by Akt
and STAT-3 intracellular pathways [33-35], which are
implicated in B-CLL pathogenesis [12, 36-39], we have
investigated the potential involvement of Akt and STAT3 in the anti-leukemic activity of Met-DCA cocrystal.
As shown in Figure 8B, down-modulation of Mcl-1 in
response to the Met-DCA cocrystal was coupled to a
significant down-regulation of phospho-Akt, total Akt,
and phospho-STAT3 protein levels. On the other hand,
in line with previous studies on Metformin [13, 14, 18],
our present study documented the ability of Met-DCA
cocrystal of stimulating the AMP-activated protein kinase
(AMPK) pathway (id, AMPK phosphorylation; Figure

8C), an energy-sensing system associated with Mcl-1
down-modulation in different cell models [40-42].

DISCUSSION
Based on FDA definition, cocrystals are solids
composed of two or more molecules in the same crystal
lattice held together in stoichiometric amounts by
freely reversible, noncovalent forces of interaction [43].
When one of the molecules is an Active Pharmaceutical
Ingredient (API) they are called pharmaceutical
cocrystals and have received recent attention because
of better pharmaceutical profiles over the native drugs
[44]. Moreover, the concept of modifying the properties
of a single API by cocrystallization with a coformer,

in vivo preclinical assessments (i.e., investigations in
animal models) and for the translation of the Met-DCA,
compound based on two inexpensive and safe drugs, to
clinical applications.
In the effort to elucidate the molecular mechanism
of action of Met-DCA cocrystal, we investigated whether
the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members might represent
targets for Met-DCA cocrystal. Our data documented a
correlation between Mcl-1 down-regulation and cytotoxicity
induced by the Metformin plus DCA combination and MetDCA cocrystal in B leukemic cells, with an early downregulation of Mcl-1 (but not of Bcl-2), associated to a
concomitant down-regulation of phospho-Akt, total Akt,
and phospho-STAT3 protein levels, which anticipated the
onset of apoptosis. These data are particularly interesting
since alteration of the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis is a
major target of cancer cells to evade apoptosis, and often
this goal is achieved through the increase in the expression
level of Bcl-2 and/or Mcl-1 [47]. In this respect, several Bcl2 inhibitors (such as navitoclax and venetoclax) have shown
efficacy as chemotherapy agents in clinical trials, by binding
with high affinity Bcl-2 and Bcl-Xl [48, 49]. However, none
of these compounds can bind and antagonize the prosurvival
activity of the Mcl-1 Bcl-2 family member, which promote
the development of many cancers and/or in their resistance to
chemotherapy [50]. It is also a key factor in the resistance of
malignant cells to navitoclax and venetoclax. Interestingly,

that may be another API that improves the delivery and
complements the efficacy of the reference drug, has
receiving increasing interest for drug development [45].
In virtue of our previous observations documenting
the cytotoxic properties of DCA towards B-CLL [9, 10], in
the present in vitro study, we have analyzed the potential
antileukemic activity of Metformin used in combination
with DCA, either as a mix of the two compounds or as
a cocrystal composed of Metformin and DCA (1:2). We
have documented the ability of the Metformin and DCA
combination and, even more, of the Met-DCA cocrystal,
in promoting cytotoxicity in both B leukemic cell lines
and B-CLL patient derived cell cultures as result of both a
cytostatic and pro-apoptotic effect.
Beyond the plausible effects on several
physicochemical properties (such as solubility), we
observed that the use of the Met-DCA cocrystal enhanced
the biological effect of the mix composed by the two
drugs, probably as a result of an improved cellular uptake
of the cocrystal compared to the reference drugs. We
could argue that the molecule Metformin may act as a
carrier for DCA, which indeed requires high dosage in
therapies because of the low bioavailability [46]. The
concept of an enhanced bioavailability of the cocrystal,
associated to the advantage of administration of a single
pharmaceutic compound instead of the separated reference
drugs, certainly offers better opportunities for future

it has been recently shown that the Notch-dependent upregulation of Mcl-1 promotes survival of B-CLL [51] and
thus it represents an axis for therapeutic interventions in the
perspective to eradicate the leukemic clone.
Since Mcl-1 silencing has been found to elicit tumor
regression and cell death in various cancer models [52],
including B-CLL [53], our data provide the rationale for
further evaluating the use of Met-DCA cocrystal (also
in combination with the Bcl-2 specific targeting drug
venetoclax) for the treatment of B-CLL, also in virtue of the
potential anti-leukemic activity of Met-DCA independently
of the p53 status.

hydrochloride, Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO; range 0.110 mM), DCA (Sigma-Aldrich; range 0.2-20 mM), used
alone or in combination, or with a Met-DCA cocrystal that
was synthesized to combine Metformin plus DCA.
At different time points after treatment, cell viability
was examined by Trypan blue dye exclusion and MTT
(3-(4,5-dimethilthiazol-2yl)-2,5-diphenyl
tetrazolium
bromide) colorimetric assay (Roche Diagnostics
Corporation, Indianapolis, IN) for data confirmation, as
previously described [56, 57]. IC50 values were calculated
from dose-response curves constructed by plotting cell
survival (%) versus drug concentration.
Levels of apoptosis were quantified by Annexin
V-FITC/propidium iodide (PI) staining (Immunotech,
Marseille, France) followed by analysis using a
FACSCalibur flow cytometer (Becton-Dickinson, San
Jose, CA). To avoid non-specific fluorescence from dead
cells, live cells were gated tightly using forward and side
scatter, as described [58, 59]. The cell cycle profile was
analyzed by flow cytometry after 5-bromodeoxyuridine
(BrdU) incorporation, as described [60].

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell cultures and treatments
The B leukemic cell lines EHEB, JVM-2 and MEC2 were purchased from DSMZ (Deutsche Sammlung von
Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen GmbH, Braunschweig,
Germany). EHEB and JVM-2 cell lines were routinely
cultured in RPMI-1640, whereas MEC-2 cells were
maintained in IMDM, all supplemented with 10% FBS,
L-glutamine and Penicillin/streptomycin (all from Gibco,
Grand Island, NY). For experiments with primary cells,
peripheral blood samples were collected in heparin-coated
tubes from either normal blood donors or from B-CLL
patients following informed consent, in accordance with the
Declaration of Helsinki and in agreement with institutional
guidelines (University-Hospital of Ferrara). The diagnosis
of B-CLL was made by peripheral blood morphology and
immunophenotyping and all patients had been without
prior therapy at least for three months before blood
collection. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC)
were isolated by gradient centrifugation with lymphocyte
cell separation medium (Cedarlane Laboratories, Hornby,
ON). T lymphocytes, NK lymphocytes, granulocytes
and monocytes were negatively depleted from peripheral
blood leucocytes (PBL) with immunomagnetic microbeads
(MACS microbeads, Miltenyi Biotech, Auburn, CA), with
a purity >95% of resulting CD19+ B-CLL population,
assessed by flow cytometry, as previously described [54,
55]. For in vitro assays, both freshly isolated or thawed
B-CLL cells, previously resuspended in freezing solution
(10% DMSO and 90% FBS) and cryopreserved in liquid
nitrogen, were seeded in RPMI containing 10% FBS,
L-glutamine and Penicillin/Streptomicin (Gibco). Freezing/
thawing of B-CLL primary cells did not influence sensitivity
to the treatments, since we assessed in parallel fresh and
frozen/thawed cells of three patients without observing any
significant cytotoxic differences.

Synthesis of the multicomponent Met-DCA
cocrystals
All adducts of Metformin with DCA (Met-DCA
1:1, MetH+•DCA−; Met-DCA 1:2, MetH2++•2DCA−) were
prepared using reagents and solvents purchased from
a commercial source (Sigma Aldrich) and used without
further purification. In particular, synthesis was carried out
as follows:
- Met-DCA 1:1 (MetH+•DCA−). A methanol
solution (30 mL) of metformin hydrochloride
(588.7 mg, 3.55 mmol) and sodium dichloroacetate
(536,4 mg, 3.55 mmol) was stirred for 12 hours
at room temperature. The solvent was removed
under reduced pressure and 2-propanol (100 mL)
was added to the reaction solid residue. Suitable
crystals for X-ray diffraction were obtained by
slow evaporation at room temperature of clear
solutions of neutral metformin and dichloroacetic
acid dissolved in 1:1 molecular ratio in a 50:50 (v:v)
methanol/n-pentanol mixture.
- Met-DCA 1:2 (MetH2++•2DCA−). Equimolar
amounts of sodium dichloroacetate (512.8 mg,
3.4 mmol) and dichloroacetic acid (438,1 mg,
3.4 mmol) were added to a methanol solution (30
mL) of metformin hydrochloride (562.7 mg, 3.4
mmol) and stirred at room temperature. After 12
hours the solvent was evaporated under reduced
pressure and 2-propanol (100 mL) was added to
the solid sediment. Suitable crystals for X-ray
diffraction were obtained by slow evaporation
at room temperature of clear solutions of neutral
metformin and dichloroacetic acid dissolved in 1:1
and 1:2 molecular ratio, respectively, in a 50:50
(v:v) methanol/n-pentanol mixture.

Western blotting analyses
For Western blotting analysis, cells were lysed as
previously described [63, 64]. Protein determination was
performed by BCA Protein Assay (Thermo Scientific,
Rockford, IL). Equal amounts of protein for each sample
were migrated in SDS-polyacrylamide gels and blotted
onto nitrocellulose filters. The following Abs were used:
anti-Mcl-1 (S-19) and anti-Bcl-2 (100) from Santa Cruz
Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA); anti-phospho-AMPKα
(Thr172, D79.5E), anti-AMPKα, anti-phospho-STAT3
(Ser727) and anti- STAT3 from Cell Signalling (Danvers,
MA); anti-phospho-Akt1/PKBα (Ser473) from Merck
Millipore (Darmstadt, Germany); anti AKT/PKBα from BD;
anti-tubulin from Sigma-Aldrich. After incubation with antimouse or anti-rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase-conjugated
secondary Abs (Sigma-Aldrich), specific reactions were
revealed with the ECL Lightning detection kit (Perkin
Elmer, Waltham, MA). The estimation of the densitometry
values of bands was obtained by the ImageQuant TL
software (GE Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, UK).

Sodium dichloroacetate exhibits anti-leukemic activity in
B-chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) and synergizes
with the p53 activator Nutlin-3. Oncotarget. 2014; 5: 43474360. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.2018

The results were evaluated by using analysis of
variance with subsequent comparisons by Student’s t-test and
with the Mann-Whitney rank-sum test. Statistical significance
was defined as p<0.05. In order to investigate the effect of
Metformin plus DCA combination, leukemic cells were
treated with serial doses of Metformin or DCA, individually
or in combination using a constant ratio (Metformin:DCA).
Results were analyzed with the method of Chou and Talalay
[26] to determine whether combined treatment yields greater
effects than expected from summation alone: a combination
index (CI) of 1 indicates an additive effect, while a CI
below 1 indicates synergism. For this purpose cell viability
data were analyzed with the CalcuSyn software (Biosoft,
Cambridge, UK) and reported either as CI values or as doseeffect curves directly drawn by the CalcuSyn software.
