ABSTRACT
Combinational drug therapy is one of the most promising strategies in modern
anticancer research. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) formulas represent a wealth
of complex combinations proven successful over centuries of clinical application.
One such formula used to treat a variety of diseases, including cancer, contains two
herbs, whose main active components are Halofuginone (HF) and Artemisinin (ATS).
Here we studied the anticancer synergism of HF and ATS in various cancer cell lines
and in a xenograft nude mice model. We found that the HF-ATS combination arrested
more cells at the G1/G0 phase than either one alone, with the concomitant increased
levels of CDK2 inhibitors, p21Cip1 and p27Kip1. By knocking down p21Cip1 and p27Kip1
separately or simultaneously in HCT116 cells and MCF-7 cells, we found that p21Cip1
was required for HF induced G1/G0 arrest, whereas p21Cip1 and p27Kip1 were both
required for ATS or HF-ATS combination-mediated cell cycle arrest. Moreover, HFATS combination synergistically inhibited tumor growth in xenograft nude mice, and
this was associated with the increased levels of p21Cip1 and p27Kip1. Collectively, these
data indicate that the upregulation of p21Cip1 and p27Kip1 contributes to the synergistic
anticancer effect of the HF-ATS combination.

Combination therapy has been the cornerstone
of herbal therapy in TCM for more than 2,500 years.
Herbs are typically prescribed in formulas, based on the
unique theory of TCM. In general, a formula is composed
of several herbs, each of which contains several active
ingredients targeting different aspect of the patient’s
condition. Researchers have found that the combination
of the main active components from the herbs in a formula
can be as effective as the formula, or even better [5, 6].
ATS and HF are two active compounds coming from
Artemisia carvifolia (Qinghao in Chinese) and Dichroa
febrifuga Lour (Changshan in Chinese), respectively,
which are two herbs commonly used together as a formula
to treat a variety of diseases in Chinese folk medicine,
including cancer. In recent years, both ATS and HF
have been intensively studied because of their potential

INTRODUCTION
Cancer is a complex disease; it affects various
tissues in multiple ways and has many subtypes [1].
Although there are various anticancer drugs, they often
have high toxicity, low efficacy, and could lead to drug
resistance after prolonged usage. One possible reason for
this phenomenon is that majority of the current anticancer
drugs were designed to target a single pathway or protein,
while cancer is often the result of an incredibly complex
combination of deregulated signaling pathways [2]. Drug
developers have observed that combinations of some
anticancer drugs exhibit synergistic effects, presumably
via simultaneously targeting multiple pathways. This
multi-pronged effect could lead to maximal therapeutic
efficacy with minimal adverse effects [3, 4].

therapeutic effects in cancer treatment. For example, ATS
has anti-proliferation effects on human breast cancer [7],
neuroblastoma [8] and ishikawa endometrial cancer [9].
HF also has the ability to inhibit the proliferation of human
colorectal cancer cells [10], multiple myeloma cells [11],
and liver cancer cells [12]. According to the history of
using the formula of Qinghao and Changshan in TCM,
we hypothesize that HF and ATS could exhibit synergistic
anticancer effect. However, to the best of our knowledge,
there is no published research on the synergistic effect of
HF and ATS on inhibiting cancer cells growth.
Here we applied the Chou-Talalay Method of
analysis [13] and found that HF-ATS combination
exhibited synergistic anticancer effects in a variety of
human cancer cell lines, and in a xenograft nude mice
model. Furthermore, we found that the combination of
HF and ATS arrested various human cancer cells at G1/
G0 phase, suggesting that the cross-talk in key signaling
pathways or key proteins may exist between these
two compounds. The cell cycle in cancer cells is often
deregulated resulting in uncontrolled cell proliferation [14,
15], thus inhibiting the cell cycle is a viable strategy for
treating cancer [16, 17]. Therefore, we speculate that the
HF-ATS combination synergistically arrests cancer cells at
G1/G0 phase by cooperatively regulating one or two key
cell cycle regulatory proteins. In this study, we constructed
p21Cip1, or p27Kip1, or p21Cip1-p27Kip1 double knockdown
cancer cell lines. Using these knockdown cancer cell lines
and the animal model, we demonstrated that the HF-ATS
combination exhibits the synergistic anticancer activity
by upregulating p21Cip1 and p27Kip1 cooperatively to arrest
cells at G1/G0 phase both in vivo and in vitro.

eight cancer cell lines. We found these combinations of
the two compounds significantly decreased cell viability
in different cancer cell lines compared with the single
agents alone, and their CIs in different cancer cells were
all < 1 (Figure 1B). Among them, HCT116 was the most
sensitive cell line in response to the HF-ATS combination.
In summary, these results indicate that HF and ATS indeed
exhibit a synergistic anticancer effect.

HF–ATS combination arrests cell cycle at the
G1/G0 phase
Since HF–ATS combination showed stronger growthinhibitory effect on various cancer cells compared with
single agents, we next investigated whether HF and ATS
alone or together had similar inhibitory effects on cell cycle
progression. We found that treatment of HCT116 cells or
MCF-7 cells with HF or ATS arrested more cells at G1/G0
phase as compared with the untreated control cells, and an
even higher percentage of cells were arrested at the G1/G0
phase after treatment of HF-ATS combination (Figure 2A).
In order to confirm those results, HCT116 cells or
MCF-7 cells were synchronized by serum starvationrelease experiments. Generally, HCT116 cells or MCF-7
cells can be synchronized at the G1/G0 phase by serum
starvation for 24 h or 48 h, respectively. After serum
starvation, these cells re-enter the cell cycle after the
addition of serum. HCT116 cells or MCF-7 cells were
successfully arrested at the G1/G0 phase by starvation
as shown in Figure S1. After serum addition, HCT116
cells or MCF-7 cells re-entered the cell cycle, with
gradual decrease of G1 phase and increase of S phase
fraction. However, treatment of cells with HF or ATS
markedly inhibited the progression of cells from G1/G0
phase to S phase transition. This defect was significantly
more severe after treatment with HF-ATS combination
( Figure S1). These results support our hypothesis that HFATS combination cooperatively arrests cells at the G1/G0
phase, thereby inhibiting the proliferation of cancer cells.

RESULTS
The HF-ATS combination synergistically inhibits
the proliferation of cancer cells
To test the synergistic anticancer activity of HF and
ATS in different cancer cell lines, firstly we performed a
MTT assay to screen the best combination ratio with threedimensional analysis [18]. HCT116 cells were cultured in a
96-well plate and treated with increasing concentrations of
HF (5 nM to 20 nM) and ATS (40 μM to 160 μM) alone or
together. We then applied the CompuSyn program, which is
based on the theory of Chou-Talalay Method, to assess the
effects of the diverse combinations. The combination index
(CI) < 1, = 1, and > 1, represents synergistic, additive, and
antagonistic effects, respectively [19]. As shown in Figure
1A, all the CIs of different ratios in HCT116 cells were <
1, indicating a synergism between HF and ATS. Among
these combinations, the 10 nM HF combined with 160 μM
ATS exhibited the lowest CI but the second highest antiproliferation potency, indicating that this ratio of HF-ATS
combination is the best. Next, a series of dose-dependent
HF-ATS combinations with the fixed ratio were tested in

HF up-regulates only p21Cip1, while ATS upregulates p21Cip1 and p27Kip1 in cancer cells
Because CDK2 and CDK2 inhibitors, such as p21Cip1
and p27Kip1, play essential roles in regulating cell cycle
progression from G1/G0 to S phase [20], we examined
the effects of HF and ATS on these targets. By using
RT-PCR, western blot, and immunostaining analyses,
we found that treatment of cells with either HF or ATS
markedly inhibited the active phosphorylation of CDK2,
and the HF-ATS combination induced a more significant
inhibition of CDK2 phosphorylation(Figure 2C and
Figure S2). HF treatment also led to an increased level of
p21Cip1 protein while ATS treatment alone or together with
HF significantly increased the levels of both p21Cip1 and
p27Kip1. Notably, p21Cip1 was increased more significantly

HF-ATS combination synergistically inhibits
tumor growth in xenograft nude mice

in the combination treatment compared with either HF
or ATS treatment (Figure 2B, 2C and Figure S2). These
observations suggest that p21Cip1 and p27Kip1 are the central
players in the G1/G0 phase cell cycle arrest induced by the
HF-ATS combination.

To determine the synergistic anticancer activity
of HF-ATS combination in vivo, nude mice were
injected with human colorectal cancer cells and then coadministrated with HF, ATS, or both. Tumor volumes and
masses were increased dramatically in the control group;
however, in animals exposed to the HF-ATS combination,
the tumor volumes and masses were significantly smaller
than those in mice treated with HF or ATS alone (Figure
6A, 6B and 6C). The anticancer ability of the HF-ATS
combination was very similar to that of 5Fu, a widely
used anticancer chemotherapy drug, but the bodyweight
of HF-ATS combination treatment group was unaffected
as compared with 5Fu, which induced bodyweight loss
with the extended treatment (Figure S8). H&E staining
showed that cells were densely packed in the tumor tissue
of the control group, while there were many vacuoles in
the tumor tissue from the HF-ATS combination treatment
group. Fewer vacuoles were found in groups treated
with HF or ATS alone. Similar to HF-ATS combination
group, the vacuoles were also observed in the 5Fu
treated group (Figure 6E). In addition, western blot and
immunofluorescence staining analyses were performed
to detect the expression levels of p21Cip1, p27Kip1 and
phospho-CDK2 in the tumors from different groups.
Although the levels of p21Cip1 and p27Kip1 were increased
and the phosphorylation of CDK2 was inhibited in the
AST or HF-ATS combination groups, their levels were
changed more significantly in the latter group. In the HF
group, only p21Cip1 was increased (Figure 6D and 6F).
In summary, these results indicate that the synergistic
inhibition of tumor growth by the HF-ATS combination is
associated with the increased levels of p21Cip1 and p27Kip1
and the decreased phosphorylation of CDK2.

p21Cip1 and p27Kip1 are required for HF-ATS
combination-induced G1/G0 arrest
To dissect the roles of p21Cip1 and p27Kip1 in the
synergistic effect of HF and ATS on cell cycle arrest, we
constructed the p21Cip1 knockdown, p27Kip1 knockdown,
and p21Cip1-p27Kip1 double knockdown HCT116 cells or
MCF-7 cells. The knockdown efficiencies were confirmed
by RT-PCR and western blot analyses (Figure 3A and 3B).
Subsequently, we analyzed the effects of HF-ATS
combination on the G1/G0 to S phase transition in these
knockdown cell lines. In p21Cip1 knockdown HCT116
cells or MCF-7 cells, ATS alone or together with HF
still induced the G1/G0 cell cycle arrest but HF alone
did not (Figure 4A). Similar results were observed in
the serum starvation-release experiment (Figure S3A).
In p27Kip1 knockdown HCT116 cells or MCF-7 cells,
ATS and HF alone or together also induced cell cycle
arrest at the G1/G0 phase. Moreover, more cells were
arrested at the G1/G0 phase in both cancer cells treated
with HF–ATS combination compared with single agent
treatment (Figure 4B). Similar results were also observed
in the serum starvation-release experiment (Figure S3B).
However, in p21Cip1-p27Kip1 double knockdown cancer
cells, neither HF nor ATS induced G1/G0 cell cycle arrest.
Even after HF-ATS combination treatment, there was no
significant difference in cell cycle progression as compared
with the control (Figure 4C). Similar results were observed
in the serum starvation synchronization experiments in
p21Cip1-p27Kip1 double knockdown cells (Figure S3C).
To further confirm whether p21Cip1 and p27Kip1 are
the central players in the G1/G0 arrest induced by HF–ATS
combination, we performed RT-PCR, western blot and
immunostaining analyses on these knockdown cell lines.
In p21Cip1 knockdown HCT116 cells or MCF-7 cells, ATS
still up-regulated the expression of p27Kip1 and inhibited the
active phosphorylation of CDK2. HF-ATS combination
treatment gave the similar result (Figure 5A, Figure S4A
and S5). In p27Kip1 knockdown HCT116 cells or MCF-7
cells, HF or ATS also up-regulated the expression of p21Cip1
and inhibited the active phosphorylation of CDK2, and
those abnormalities were further manifested by the HF-AST
combination treatment (Figure 5B, Figure S4B and S6).
In contrast, in p21Cip1-p27Kip1 double knockdown cancer
cells, HF, or ATS, or HF-ATS combination had no effects
on the expression of the aforementioned targets (Figure 5C,
Figure S4C and S7). Collectively, these results indicate
that both p21Cip1 and p27Kip1 are required for the synergistic
inhibitory effects of HF-ATS combination on tumor cells
growth.

DISCUSSION
In the past few years, accumulating evidence
indicate that combination therapy is more effective with
fewer side effects than single drug in the cancer treatment
[21]. Consequently, in the pharmacological industry, there
is a shift from developing drugs specifically targeting
single signaling pathway or protein to combination
therapies that consist of more than one active ingredients
targeting multiple signaling pathways or proteins [22].
In TCM, combination therapies are the rule rather than
the exception; over centuries of practice, many multiherb formulas have been developed to effectively treat
a wide spectrum of diseases and medical conditions.
Given its long history of successful clinical application,
TCM is a likely source of therapeutic agents for modern
pharmaceutical development for many diseases, including
cancer [23]. Already there has been some success of this
strategy, for example, researchers have identified multiple

active components from a traditional formula, and the
combination of which are effective in treating acute
promyelocytic leukemia (APL) [5].
In this study, we hypothesize that the combination
of two ingredients, HF and ATS, derived from two herbs
in a TCM formula, has a synergistic anticancer effect.
In order to confirm our hypothesis, firstly we identified
the best ratio of HF–ATS combination by screening with
three-dimensional analysis. Subsequently, we confirmed
the activities of a series of dose-dependent HF-ATS
combinations with the fixed ratio in various cancer cell
lines. The results showed all the CIs in different cancer

cells were < 1. The CI is the natural law–based general
expression of pharmacologic drug interactions, and is
the simplest possible way for quantifying synergism or
antagonism [13]. Our results indicated that HF and ATS
indeed exhibited synergistic anticancer effect in vitro,
and HF-ATS combination showed the highest effect in
HCT116 cells. In addition, the synergistic anticancer
activity of HF-ATS combination on tumor growth was
validated in xenograft-bearing nude mice. Notably, in
the animal model, the administrated dose of HF or ATS
was much lower compared with the previous reports [10,
24, 25], while the weight and size of tumor in HF-ATS

combination group were markedly smaller than either
HF or ATS group alone. This result confirms that there
is a synergistic anticancer effect in vivo for the HF-ATS
combination.
It’s clear that, in cancer cells, the cell cycle is often
deregulated as a result of genetic mutations, which lead
to uncontrolled cell proliferation [14, 15]. Therefore,
inhibiting the cell cycle process is a good strategy for
treating cancer, as well as other proliferative diseases
[16, 17]. In this study, we found that treatment of cells
with either HF or ATS arrested cancer cells at the G1/
G0 phase, which was consistent with previous reports
[26, 27]. Interestingly, treatment of cells with HF-ATS
combination arrested more cells at the G1/G0 phase
compared with either agent alone. This suggests that
arrest of cells at the G1/G0 phase is the biochemical
basis for the synergistic anticancer effect of the HF-ATS
combination.
Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) are the central
components which govern the initiation, progression
and completion of cell division [28]. In particular, the
transition of cell cycle from the G1/G0 to the S phase is
regulated by CDK2, and its excess activity is correlated
with the deregulated cell proliferation rates in cancers
[29]. Hence, CDK2 inhibitors are potentially effective
anticancer agents [30]. p21Cip1 and p27Kip1 are two main
CDK-inhibitors (CKIs); they regulate CDK2 activity by
binding to cyclin-CDK complexes thereby inhibiting
their catalytic activity [31]. Thus, the regulation of CDK2
through p27Kip1 and p21Cip1 plays a key role in controlling
the tempo of gene transcription in G1 phase and in the
subsequent progression to the cell division [32]. In our in
vitro and in vivo studies, we found that treatment of cells
with HF was associated with inactive CDK2 through upregulation of p21Cip1, while ATS treatment inhibited CDK2
in association with the up-regulation of both p21Cip1 and
p27Kip1. These data suggest that p21Cip1 and p27Kip1 are the
key factors for the arrest of cancer cells at G1/G0 phase by
the HF-ATS combination.
Next, we knocked down p21Cip1 or/and p27Kip1 in
HCT116 cells or MCF-7 cells. In p21Cip1 knockdown cells,
ATS or HF-ATS combination up-regulated p27Kip1 and
inactivated CDK2, thereby resulting in cell arrest at G1/
G0 phase. In contrast, HF treatment had no obvious effects
on cell cycle progression in p21Cip1 knockdown cells. On
the other hand, in p27Kip1 knockdown cells, HF or ATS
arrested cells at G1/G0 phase, up-regulated p21Cip1, and
inactivated CDK2. Notably, HF-ATS combination arrested
more cells at the G1/G0 phase in p27Kip1 knockdown cells
compared with either agent alone. Not surprisingly, p21Cip1
and p27Kip1 double knockdown completely abolished
the growth inhibitory effects of HF, ATS, or HF-ATS
combination. In conclusion, those results demonstrate that
p21Cip1 and p27Kip1 are the two key factors for the ability
of HF-ATS combination to arrest cancer cells at G1/G0
phase.

In summary, we reported the first study of the use
of HF-ATS combination to treat cancer. Specifically, we
investigated the effect of HF-ATS combination on cell
cycle arrest at molecular, cellular and animal levels.
Obviously, further work to develop HF-ATS combination
into a useful clinical anticancer drug should continue, and
the potential combinational drugs in TCM might provide
the alternative “answers” for cancer treatment.

Amplification of p21Cip1 and p27Kip1 cDNAs was
performed using the LightCycler 2000 instrument (Roche,
Indianapolis, IN). The cycling conditions comprised a
denaturation step for 15 minutes at 95 °C, followed by 40
cycles of denaturation (95 °C for 15 seconds), annealing
(59 °C for 20 seconds), and extension (72 °C for 15
seconds). After amplification, a melting curve analysis was
performed with denaturation at 95 °C for 5 seconds, then
continuous fluorescence measurement was made from 70
°C to 95 °C at 0.1 °C/second. Each sample was amplified
in duplicate.

Knockdown of p21Cip1 or/and p27Kip1
The PLKO.1 (puro) plasmid was purchased from
Addgene (plasmid#8453), and the optimal 21mers for
p21Cip1 and p27Kip1 were respectively selected from
the RNAi consortium (TRC) (21mers for p21Cip1:
5’-CGCTCTACATCTTCTGCCTTA-3’; and 21mers
for p27Kip1: 5’-GCGCAAGTGGAATTTCGATTT-3’).
The 21mers were synthesized and inserted into PLKO.1
to generate the lentiviral plasmids, PLKO.1sh21 and
PLKO.1sh27, according to the PLKO.1-TRC protocol
[33]. Then HEK 293T cell was used for lentivirus package.
Briefly, HEK-293T cells were plated in 6-well plates and
changed to medium without penicillin-streptomycin before
use. The lentiviral plasmids, together with the two viruses
packaging plasmids (psPAX2 and pMD2.G, purchased
from Addgene #12260 and #12259), were transfected
into 293T cells by lipofectamine2000 (Invitrogen, 11668019). The medium was changed on Day2, and the virus
was collected on Days3 and 4. MCF-7 or HCT116 cells
were infected with the virus in the presence of polybrene
(8 µg/mL) for two days. Cells were then selected in
fresh medium containing puromycin (3 µg/mL) for 3–5
days. The puromycin-resistant cells were pooled and the
knockdown efficiency was verified by both quantitative
real-time RT-PCR and/or western blot analyses. For
of p21Cip1 and p27Kip1 double knockdown, the p27Kip1
knockdown cell lines were used to further knockdown
p21Cip1.

Tumorigenesis in nude mice
Six-week old female BALB/c nude mice were
purchased from the Laboratory Animal Services Centre,
The Chinese University of Hong Kong. Mice were kept
at room temperature 23°C ± 2°C with an alternating 12
h light-dark cycle, and were allowed access to food and
water. All of the experimental protocols were carried out
with the approval of the Committee on Use of Human and
Animal Subjects in Teaching and Research of Hong Kong
Baptist University and according to the Regulations of the
Department of Health, Hong Kong SAR, China. HCT116
cells (5 × 106 cells per mouse) were suspended in PBS
and inoculated subcutaneously into the left flank of each
mouse; tumor growth was monitored regularly. Once
tumors were palpable, (~100 mm3), mice were divided at
random into five groups, each group with 5 mice, treated as
follows: (1) vehicle group (daily i.p. saline), (2) HF group
(daily i.p. 5 µg/kg of HF), (3) ATS group (daily i.p. 50 mg/
kg of ATS), (4) HF combined with ATS group (daily i.p. 5
µg/kg of HF and 50 mg/kg of ATS), (5) 5Fu group (daily
i.p. 10 mg/kg of 5Fu). Although much higher dosage
of HF and ATS were given to mouse in vivo compared

Western blot analysis
HCT116 cells or MCF-7 cells were treated with
drugs for 12 h or 24 h, respectively, and whole cell lysates
were then obtained by suspending the cells in lysis buffer.
Followed by centrifugation at 13,500 rpm for 15 min at
4 °C, total protein concentration was measured using
Pierce(R) BCA Protein Assay Kit, and 10 to 25 μg of
protein was separated on 10 % SDS-PAGE and transferred
to PVDF membranes. After blocking (5 % skim milk
powder in TBST, 20) for 1 h at room temperature, the
membrane was then incubated with primary antibody
overnight at 4 °C. Afterwards, the membrane was

with cells in vitro, the concentration ratio of HF-ATS
combination was equal. The tumors were measured with
calipers every day, and tumor volumes were calculated by
the following formula: a2×b×0.4, where “a” is the smallest
diameter and “b” is the diameter perpendicular to “a”. At
the end of the experiment, the mice were sacrificed and the
tumor weights of each animal were analyzed.

H&E staining and protein extraction form
tumors

REFERENCES

After the mice were sacrificed, tumors were
resected immediately and fixed in 10 % neutral buffered
paraformaldehyde at 4 °C for 24 h. Selected samples
were embedded in paraffin, sectioned and treated in the
following steps for H&E staining: hematoxylin for 10 min,
1 % acid–ethanol for 30 s, 1 % ammonia water for 30
s, and eosin for 10 s. After staining, tissue sections were
dehydrated with water–ethanol–xylene gradients. Sections
were finally mounted with D.P.X mountant(Sigma,
317616) for histology analysis. To measure the p21Cip1,
p27Kip1 and phospho-CDK2 activity in tumor tissue,
tumors from every group were collected and dispersed
in lysis buffer by sonication for protein extraction. After
centrifugation at 13,500 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C, the
supernatant was collected and regarded as the total soluble
proteins which were subsequently subjected to western
blot analysis.
