Abstract
Interactions between tumor and stroma cells are essential for the progression of cancer from its initial
growth at a primary site to its metastasis to distant organs. The metastasis-stimulating protein S100A4 exerts
its function as a stroma cell–derived factor. Genetic depletion of S100A4 significantly reduced the metastatic
burden in lungs of PyMT-induced mammary tumors. In S100A4+/+ PyMT mice, massive leukocyte infiltration at
the site of the growing tumor at the stage of malignant transition was associated with increased concentration
of extracellular S100A4 in the tumor microenvironment. In contrast, in S100A4−/− PyMT tumors, a significant
suppression of T-cell infiltration was documented at the transition period. In vitro, the S100A4 protein mediated the attraction of T cells. Moreover, S100A4+/+, but not S100A4−/−, fibroblasts stimulated the invasion of
T lymphocytes into fibroblast monolayers. In vivo, the presence of S100A4+/+, but not S100A4−/−, fibroblasts
significantly stimulated the attraction of T lymphocytes to the site of the growing tumor. Increased levels
of T cells were also observed in the premetastatic lungs of tumor-bearing mice primed to metastasize by
S100A4+/+ fibroblasts. Treatment of T cells with the S100A4 protein stimulated production of cytokines, particularly granulocyte colony-stimulating factor and eotaxin-2. The same cytokines were detected in the fluid of
S100A4+/+ PyMT tumors at the transition period. We suggest that release of S100A4 in the primary tumor stimulates infiltration of T cells and activates secretion of cytokines, thus triggering sequential events that fuel
tumor cells to metastasize. Similar processes could occur in the premetastatic lungs, facilitating generation of
inflammatory milieu favorable for metastasis formation. Cancer Res; 70(3); 936–47. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
An accumulating body of evidence indicates that responses of stroma cells in neoplastic tissues stimulate tumor
progression and subsequent metastatic spread. These cells
include fibroblasts, vascular cells, infiltrating leukocytes, as
well as bone marrow–derived myeloid cells (1). Leukocytes
from both lineages, myeloid and lymphoid, have been shown
to regulate cancer development. The mechanisms underlying
the response of immune cells to a particular tumor are poorly understood. For example, macrophages are capable of
modifying cancer cell behavior and promoting tumor invasion and metastasis. Contra wise, they can show pronounced
antitumorigenic activity (2, 3).

The roles of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, B cells, and
various proportions of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in metastatic
progression are much less understood (4).
The presence of CD8+ CTLs normally reflects a strong
antitumor response. In contrast, CD4+ T-helper cells play a
tumor-promoting role. It has been shown that Th2-polarized
T-helper cells downregulate cell-mediated antitumor immunity and enhance protumor immune responses (4). Among
CD4+ cells, a subset of regulatory T cells is increased in tumors and is capable of suppressing proliferation of other
T cells in the microenvironment (5). Recent data strongly
linked CD4+ T cells with stimulation of metastasis (6). T cells
secrete growth factors and cytokines, which support tumor
angiogenesis and recruit macrophages, thus accelerating tumor growth and metastasis (1).
The transgenic mouse model based on the expression of
polyoma virus middle T oncoprotein placed under control
of mouse mammary tumor virus promoter, thereby directing expression of the oncogene to the mammary gland
(MMTV-PyMT mice), is widely used to study the effect of
different genes on mammary tumorigenesis (7). In MMTVPyMT mice, four distinctly identifiable stages of tumor progression from premalignant to malignant are described in
detail, making this model a useful tool for studying tumor
progression (8).
S100A4, a member of the S100 family of calcium-binding
proteins, promotes tumor metastasis (9). Poor prognostic
outcomes of a variety of human cancers were correlated

with S100A4 expression (10). Accumulating lines of evidence
indicate that S100A4 stimulates metastasis as an extracellular factor. Indeed, S100A4 is predominantly expressed
and released from breast cancer stroma cells (11). Its secretion can be stimulated in vitro from fibroblasts and other
cells that compose the tumor stroma (12). As an extracellular
protein, S100A4 acts as an angiogenic factor; stimulates
neurite outgrowth, cell survival, and tumor cell migration;
and activates epidermal growth factor receptor, the transcription factor NF-κB, and the mitogen-activated protein
(MAP) kinase pathway, leading to the activation of downstream genes (13–19). Moreover, we found that tumor graft
development and metastasis formation is impeded in mice
deficient in S100A4 (20). Recent data implicate extracellular
S100A4 in various inflammation-associated noncancer pathologies (21).
In the present study, we implemented the MMTV-PyMT
tumor model to study the influence of S100A4 expression
at early stages of tumor development on metastasis formation. We present lines of evidence that S100A4 released into
the tumor microenvironment at a stage of malignant transition from adenoma/MIN to early carcinoma induces massive
infiltration of T cells and release of specific cytokines, leading
to increased pulmonary metastases. Infiltration of T cells in
premetastatic lungs was induced by S100A4+/+ fibroblasts,
probably generating a favorable microenvironment for metastasis formation.

Materials and Methods
Reagents. S100A4 protein was isolated as described by Novitskaya and colleagues (14). SDF-1α was purchased from PeproTech, and fibronectin was from Sigma-Aldrich. RPMI
1640, Opti-MEM, and FCS were purchased from Invitrogen.
Mice. Virgin females of S100A4+/+ PyMT and S100A4−/−
PyMT genotype or S100A4−/− mice of A/Sn genetic background were used for experiments. See details of breeding
and genotyping in Supplementary Data. All animals were
maintained according to the Federation of European Laboratory Animal Science Associations guidelines for the care and
use of laboratory animals.
Metastasis assay. CSML100 mouse mammary carcinoma
cells (1 × 106) expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein
(EGFP) were injected s.c. to S100A4−/− A/Sn mice followed by
i.v. injection of 2.5 × 105 S100A4+/+ or S100A4−/− mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF; ref. 20).
Injections of MEFs were repeated three times with 1-wk
intervals. Animals were either sacrificed 1 wk after the last
injection (premetastatic phase) or left until the tumor
reached maximum allowed size (864 mm3; metastatic phase).
Lungs were isolated and subjected to standard immunohistochemical analysis.
Immunohistochemistry. Tumor tissue sections were
stained with affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibodies
against S100A4 (22), anti-CD3 (Abcam), anti-F4/80 (Accurate
Chemicals), anti–α-smooth muscle actin and anti-laminin
(Sigma-Aldrich), anti-CD31 and anti-CD45 (BD Biosciences),
and anti-EGFP (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) according to the

www.aacrjournals.org

manufacturer's protocols. Corresponding secondary horseradish peroxidase–conjugated antibodies were used followed
by incubation with chromogenic substrate 3,3′-diaminobenzidine (DAKO). For double staining, secondary antibodies
coupled to Alexa Fluor 488 or Alexa Fluor 568 (1:1,500) were
purchased from Molecular Probes. Sections were examined
by means of confocal microscopy on a LSM 510 (Carl Zeiss,
Inc.). The blood vessel density was determined by quantifying
the amount of CD31+ capillaries in 10 fields from two sections of different parts of the tumor (magnification, ×200).
S100A4+ cells, leukocytes, macrophages, and T lymphocytes
were quantified by determining the amount of S100A4+ ,
CD45+, F4/80+, and CD3+ cells in 10 fields from two sections
of different parts of the PyMT tumors (magnification, ×400)
obtained from mice ages 6 (n = 5), 8 (n = 4), 12 (n = 5), and
18 ± 5 (n = 10) wk. Quantification of T cells in tumor xenografts was performed using paraffin blocks from the study
(n = 10 per group; ref. 20).
Quantification of leukocytes and T cells in the vicinity of
blood vessels in premetastatic lungs was performed by
counting fluorescently labeled CD45+ (n = 10–15 mice per
group) and CD3+ cells (n = 10–12 per group) in the surrounding of vessels visualized by staining with anti–smooth muscle
actin antibodies. Ten vessels of 100 to 200 nm in length per
section were selected for analysis.
Sandwich ELISA assays. S100A4 sandwich ELISA was
used to determine the amount of S100A4 in the mouse tumor
interstitial fluids (TIF). For TIF analysis, 50 mg of tumor tissue were removed and incubated for 2 h at 37°C in 1,000 μL
PBS as described by Celis and colleagues (23).
Sandwich ELISA was done as described (13). A granulocyte
colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) ELISA kit (RayBiotech) was
used to determine G-CSF concentration in cell culture–
conditioned medium and TIFs according to the manufacturer's instructions.
T-lymphocyte purification by magnetic cell sorting.
Spleens were removed from mice, and single-cell suspensions
were layered onto Histopaque (Sigma-Aldrich) and centrifuged to remove RBCs. Cells were purified by negative selection using the Pan T Cell Isolation kit (Miltenyi Biotech)
according to the manufacturer's instructions. The purity
of the T lymphocyte fraction assessed by flow cytometry
analysis was >90%. Cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 with
10% FCS.
Chemotaxis assay. In vitro chemotaxis assay with Transwell chambers (pore size, 5 μm) obtained from Corning was
conducted as described (24). Transwells were coated with
50 μg/mL fibronectin at 4°C overnight. A total of 1 × 106 purified T cells in 100 μL RPMI 1640 with 1% FCS were added to
the upper chamber. The S100A4 protein was added either
alone or together with rabbit Ig (DAKO) or anti-S100A4 antibodies to the bottom chamber (22). SDF-1α (100 ng/mL) was
used as a positive control in each experiment. After 90 min at
37°C, migrated cells were collected and counted. The experiments were performed in duplicate and repeated a minimum
of three times.
T-lymphocyte invasion assay. Invasion of T lymphocytes
into fibroblast monolayers was tested using a modification

of the method (25). MEFs were grown to confluency in 24-well
plates; T lymphocytes were labeled with Vybrant DID celllabeling solution (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's
instructions. Labeled T lymphocytes (7 × 105) were added to
the wells and incubated for 4 h. Noninvaded cells were removed by washing and mechanical agitation four times in
PBS. The infiltrated cells were counted using a fluorescence
microscope (Zeiss, Metamorph software) in three random
fields (magnification, ×100) per well. Invasion assays were performed in RPMI 1640 containing 10% FCS with or without
rabbit Ig (DAKO) or anti-S100A4 antibodies. The experiments
were performed in triplicates and repeated twice.
Cytokine antibody array and Western blot analyses. Purified T lymphocytes (1 × 107) were treated with the multimeric
S100A4 (1 μg/mL) for 19 h in Opti-MEM supplemented with
10 μg/mL polymyxin B (Invitrogen). The conditioned medium
was harvested and filtered through a 0.45-μm membrane. Cell
viability was checked using LDH Cytotoxicity Detection kit
(Roche) according to the manufacturer's protocol.
TIFs from 12-wk-old S100A4+/+ PyMT (n = 5) and 12-wkold S100A4−/− PyMT mouse tumors (n = 5) were pooled.
The protein concentrations in TIFs were measured and
equilibrated.
RayBio Mouse Cytokine Antibody Arrays 3 and 4 were purchased from RayBiotech, and the cytokine analyses in conditioned medium and TIFs were carried out according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
Purified T cells were starved in RPMI 1640 for 3 h and
stimulated with multimeric S100A4 (1 μg/mL) or with SDF1α (100 ng/mL). Cell lysates were prepared in the presence of
phosphatase inhibitors and resolved by SDS-PAGE. Activation of MAP kinase pathway was analyzed using a standard
Western blot procedure with phospho-p44/42 extracellular
signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2; Thr 202 /Tyr 204 ) and
p44/42 ERK1/2 antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology).
Statistical analyses. Data are presented as average ± SEM.
The confidence level was calculated using Student's t test.

Results
S100A4 deficiency suppresses metastases of mammary
tumors of MMTV-PyMT mice. To investigate the role of
S100A4 at early stages of metastatic breast cancer development, we induced mammary carcinogenesis in wild-type
and S100A4−/− mice by using the MMTV-PyMT transgenic
model. Comparison of the tumor development showed similar growth pattern both in the S100A4−/− and in the S100A4+/+
PyMT mice (Supplementary Table S1).
Analysis of the lung sections from 18 ± 5-week-old
tumor-bearing animals showed that the number of metastatic nodules and the overall metastatic burden were both
significantly suppressed in S100A4−/− PyMT mice (Fig. 1A
and B).
The grading of tumors showed that tumors developed in
mice at the age of 12 weeks represented a period of transition
to malignancy (Supplementary Table S2). Because we aimed
to study early stages of tumor development, 12-week-old
mice were used for further analysis.

Decreased metastatic burden in lungs of S100A4 −/−
PyMT mice is associated with reduced vessel density.
Because the S100A4 protein is an angiogenic factor (13,
17) we proposed that suppression of lung metastases in
S100A4−/− PyMT mice might be associated with the suppression of angiogenesis in the primary tumor. Consequently, we
compared the vascular density of the primary tumors of the
18 ± 5-week-old tumor-bearing S100A4 −/− and S100A4 +/+
PyMT mice. To assure accurate verification of vessel density,
we determined the number of capillaries in morphologically
different histopathologic compartments of the section
(Fig. 1C). In compartments corresponding to both early
and late carcinoma, the vessel density in the S100A4 +/+
tumors was significantly higher when compared with
S100A4−/− tumors (Fig. 1C). The same tendency was observed
in the adenoma/MIN compartment, although the difference
was not statistically significant.
S100A4 is released at early stage of PyMT mammary tumor development. To associate increased vessel density with
S100A4 expression, we performed immunohistochemical
staining of tumor sections from S100A4+/+ PyMT mice at different ages with anti-S100A4 antibodies (Fig. 2A). As expected, independently of the stage of tumor development,
S100A4 was expressed mostly in tumor stroma. S100A4+ stroma cells were found most abundant in sections displaying
adenoma/MIN and early carcinoma, which corresponded to
the transition from premalignant lesion to malignant tumor
(8), whereas late carcinoma contained far fewer S100A4+
stroma cells. Interestingly, pulmonary metastases also
contained S100A4+ cells accumulated in the area of the lesion
(data not shown). Quantification of the number of S100A4+
cells localized in different compartments of the tumor
showed that the majority of S100A4+ cells were concentrated
in the area surrounding adenoma/MIN–early carcinoma
(Fig. 2B).
Further, we correlated the release of S100A4 into the tumor microenvironment with the accumulation of S100A4+
stroma cells.
Examination of the S100A4 protein concentrations in TIFs
from tumors isolated from 6-, 8-, 12-, and 18 ± 5-week-old
mice revealed substantial increase of S100A4 in TIFs from
12-week-old mice containing adenoma/MIN–early carcinoma compared with TIFs from 6- to 8-week-old mice containing mostly normal mammary gland and hyperplasia (Fig. 2C).
The concentration of S100A4 in late carcinomas was reduced
(Fig. 2C). Fluctuation of extracellular S100A4 concentration
showed a good correlation with the abundance of S100A4+
cells in stroma of tumors at distinct stages of development
(Fig. 2B).
Decreased infiltration of T cells in S100A4−/− tumors.
Based on our studies of tumor growth in S100A4−/− mice
(20), we expected a decrease in leukocyte infiltration in tumors of S100A4−/− PyMT mice. Indeed, we revealed a remarkable shortage of CD45+ leukocytes infiltrating S100A4 −/−
PyMT tumors (Fig. 3A). Quantification of the number of
leukocytes surrounding different histopathologic compartments of the tumor showed a significant decrease in
the area of adenoma/MIN in S100A4 −/− compared with

S100A4 +/+ PyMT tumors (Fig. 3B). Lin and colleagues (2)
recently showed an increase in macrophage infiltration in
premalignant tumors of wild-type PyMT mice that play a
causal role in regulating the angiogenic switch and progression to malignancy. We therefore assessed the amount
of macrophages infiltrating early developing tumors in
S100A4+/+ and S100A4−/− PyMT mice. Indeed, macrophages

www.aacrjournals.org

heavily infiltrated the vicinity of adenoma/MIN but not hyperplasia in both 8- and 12-week-old mice (Fig. 3C). Quantification of the infiltrating macrophages showed a tendency
toward lower abundance in S100A4−/− tumors of 8-week-old
mice; however, the difference was not statistically significant
(P = 0.11).
In contrast to macrophages, comparison of the numbers
of infiltrating T lymphocytes at different stages of tumor
development revealed that S100A4 deficiency led to substantially reduced numbers of T cells infiltrating adenoma/MIN
(Fig. 3D).
S100A4 attracted T lymphocytes in vitro and activated
the MAP kinase pathway. Our observations thus far suggested that S100A4 could be a mediator of T lymphocyte
infiltration into the tumor. We therefore tested the attraction
of T cells isolated from spleens of S100A4+/+ and S100A4−/−
mice toward S100A4 in a Transwell migration assay. These
experiments showed that S100A4 was capable to attract
T lymphocytes from both sources in a concentrationdependent manner. Moreover, S100A4 antibodies blocked
S100A4-induced chemoattraction of T cells (Fig. 4A). The
ratio between nonmigrated and migrated CD4+/CD8+ and
CD4+ /CD25 + T-cell populations was determined by flow
cytometry and did not reveal any differences between
S100A4+/+ and S100A4−/− splenocytes (data not shown).
We also tested the capability of naturally produced S100A4
to attract T lymphocytes. It has been shown that MEFs stimulate tumor progression and release S100A4 into the cell culture medium in vitro (12, 20). T-cell monolayer invasion
assays (26) showed that T lymphocytes failed to invade into
S100A4−/− MEF monolayer, whereas S100A4+/+ MEFs strongly
attracted T lymphocytes. Moreover, S100A4 antibodies
blocked T lymphocyte invasion into the S100A4+/+ MEF
monolayer (Fig. 4B).
It is known that cells respond to S100A4 treatment via activation of the MAP kinase pathway (14).
Therefore, we tested whether the ERK1/2 signal-regulated
kinases are phosphorylated in T cells in response to S100A4
treatment. Figure 4C shows the time-dependent activation
of S100A4-induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2, whereas
S100A4 had no effect on p38 kinase phosphorylation (data
not shown).
S100A4+/+ MEFs stimulate attraction of T lymphocytes to
the tumor grafts. Suppression of tumor development and metastasis formation due to the aberrant stroma formation was
earlier observed in S100A4−/− mice. Addition of S100A4+/+
MEFs to the xenografts resulted in stimulation of tumor development associated with the increase of S100A4 in TIFs (20).
Therefore, we proposed that tumor growth stimulation by
S100A4+/+ MEFs is associated with the attraction of T cells
to the tumor stroma.
Indeed, tumor grafts supplied with S100A4+/+ in contrast
to S100A4−/− MEFs attracted more T cells to the stroma
(Fig. 4D).
S100A4+/+ MEFs facilitate attraction of T cells to the premetastatic lungs. As it was mentioned above, we observed
accumulation of S100A4+ cells at the site of metastases in
lungs of tumor-bearing PyMT mice. We therefore proposed

that the attraction of T cells could be associated with the
formation of secondary tumors in the lungs. To assess the
role of T cells in metastasis formation, we generated a model
where metastatic mammary carcinoma cells, CSML100,
whose metastatic ability was suppressed in S100A4−/− mice
(20), were primed to metastasize by supplying animals with
S100A4+/+ MEFs by i.v. administration (see Materials and
Methods for details). Analysis of the pulmonary metastases
in the tumor-bearing mice in metastatic stage (maximal size
of the tumor) showed that 28% (n = 7) of mice contained
detectable metastatic nodules in the lungs. Lungs of tumor-bearing mice on premetastatic stage contained solitary
tumor cells with a scattered distribution within the lungs.
The identity of tumor cells was determined by immunostaining of consecutive sections with S100A4 (Fig. 5A) and
EGFP antibodies (Supplementary Fig. S1). Administration of
S100A4 +/+ MEFs significantly increased the amount of

tumor cells present in the lungs (Fig. 5A). Moreover, lungs
of tumor-bearing mice with S100A4+/+ MEF administration
but not S100A4−/− MEFs showed pronounced accumulation
of leukocytes in the vicinity of blood vessels. Monoinjection
of S100A4+/+ and S100A4−/− MEFs or CSML100 cells did not
reveal leukocyte accumulation (Fig. 5B). Quantification of
T cells showed significant increase in the amount of T cells
accumulated around the vessels in the premetastatic lungs
supplied with S100A4 +/+ MEFs (Fig. 5C). Obtained data
indicate that T cells can participate in the preconditioning of secondary organs to accept tumor cells and develop
metastasis.
S100A4 stimulates production of cytokines from T lymphocytes. The capability of S100A4 to activate T cells was
tested by its ability to stimulate the cytokine production.
Indeed, T lymphocytes stimulated by S100A4 produced
increased levels of 11 cytokines and growth factors as

The result shown in Fig. 6D revealed that G-CSF was substantially increased in TIFs of 12-week-old mice compared
with 6- or 18 ± 5-week-old mice.

Discussion
Our studies of spontaneous tumor development in MMTVS100A4 GRS/A transgenic mice as well as clinical observations that correlate expression of S100A4 at early stages of
breast cancer progression with poor prognosis (22, 27) led
to the hypothesis that S100A4 modifies the tumor microenvironment at early stages of tumor development. We imple-

mented the MMTV-PyMT mammary tumor model to
analyze the role of S100A4 in premalignant tumor development by generating S100A4−/− PyMT mice. Tumor formation
was not affected by S100A4 deficiency, but the resulting tumors had low vascular indices, which correlated with the suppression of pulmonary metastases. This has been shown in
previous research on a similar tumor model on a BALB/c genetic background (28), indicating that the metastasis-inducing effect of S100A4 is independent of the genetic background.
Increased expression and release of S100A4 from tumor
stroma cells was documented during the transition period
from adenoma/MIN to early carcinoma. Furthermore, we

S100A4 Mediated T-Cell Deficiency

observed massive infiltration of macrophages and T cells at
this transition period of tumor development, confirming earlier observations in the same mouse model (2). Macrophages
and T cells are major components of the inflammatory cell
population present in the tumor stroma. Particularly in breast
cancer, these cells are regarded as causal players in primary
cancer development and metastatic dissemination (3, 4, 29). It
has been shown recently that the malignant transition of
MMTV-PyMT–induced tumors is associated with the influx
of macrophages (2). Comparing the amount of macrophages
and T cells infiltrating adenoma/MIN in S100A4 +/+ and
S100A4−/− tumors showed a decrease in both cell types in
S100A4-deficient tumors. Although the reduction of the
amount of macrophages was not statistically significant, the
number of infiltrated T cells was substantially reduced. These
observations suggested that an increase of S100A4 in the tumor microenvironment at premalignant stage contributed to
the attraction of inflammatory cells to the developing tumor.
Generation of the protumor inflammatory microenvironment is mainly attributed to macrophages that facilitate
the remodeling of the ECM, stimulation of angiogenesis, tumor cell migration, invasion, and eventually metastasis (4,
30). In the MMTV-PyMT mouse model, macrophages regulate the angiogenic switch and by this stimulate tumor progression (2).
The role of T cells in the generation of the protumor inflammatory microenvironment is much less understood. Earlier,
the accumulation of T cells was considered as indicator of
immune surveillance by the host. Simultaneously, numerous
reports linked immune cell infiltration to poor prognosis
(31). A study of the functional properties of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes showed that they were largely inactive (31).
Very recent data obtained by DeNardo and colleagues (6)
convincingly showed that increased presence of CD4+ T cells
promotes metastasis of mammary carcinoma by enhancing
the protumor activity of myeloid cells.
Here, we associated the S100A4-dependent suppression of
the metastatic ability of MMTV-PyMT tumors with the lack
of tumor-infiltrating T cells. In vitro, the S100A4 protein
seemed to be a potent attractant of T cells. Moreover, T cells
were attracted to tumor xenografts supplied with S100A4+/+
MEFs as a source of S100A4 protein.
All this supports the presumption that S100A4 released into the microenvironment displays its activity at the transition to malignancy by attracting T cells to the early
developing tumor. Dissemination of tumor cells occurs not
only from the advanced tumors as it was considered earlier
but also from the early epithelial alterations, such as hyperplasia and adenoma/MIN, in MMTV-PyMT mammary tumors (32). The events that facilitate the early spread could
be associated with massive invasion of leukocytes that produce a plethora of molecules, which in turn modify the tumor microenvironment and stimulate angiogenesis.
T cells, activated by S100A4, produced cytokines and
growth factors. Many of them are known as proinflammatory
cytokines, which are associated with poor prognosis in cancer
patients (33). Two cytokines were overproduced by S100A4activated T cells and were present in increased amounts in

www.aacrjournals.org

TIFs of early S100A4+/+ PyMT tumors. Enhanced G-CSF and
eotaxin-2 were found both in TIFs isolated from early transition stage tumors of S100A4+/+ mice and in conditioned medium from S100A4-activated T cells.
Eotaxin-2 (CCL24, MPIF-2), a proinflammatory cytokine, is
a potent chemoattractant for eosinophils, which in some tumors (squamous cell carcinoma and colorectal tumors) was
found to suppress the immune response and promote proliferation (34–36). G-CSF, another proinflammatory cytokine, is
involved in the proliferation and differentiation of granulocytes and their precursors as well as in hematopoietic stem
cell mobilization (37). G-CSF is routinely used during cancer
chemotherapy to promote neutrophil proliferation and mobilization to decrease infections (38). Despite this, recent data pointed to the involvement of G-CSF in tumor progression
and metastasis. G-CSF stimulated skin tumor progression
and bone tumor growth (39–41). G-CSF production increased
invasiveness of human head and neck carcinoma and hepatocarcinoma cell lines (42). Interestingly, G-CSF mediates mobilization of CD11b+ Gr-1+ myeloid cells that, as it was shown
recently, stimulate metastatic spread of tumor (43, 44).
Attraction of T cells to the tumor xenografts supplied with
MEFs as a source of S100A4 pointed to activated fibroblasts
as a candidate cell type for the production of S100A4 and its
release into the tumor microenvironment. Indeed, recent data obtained in our laboratory showed that tumor cells produced cytokines, such as RANTES, which stimulated
secretion of S100A4 from fibroblasts.3 Other cell types, including tumor cells, macrophages, mast cells, neutrophils,
and certain classes of T cells, also could be stimulated to secrete S100A4 (11).
It has earlier been suggested that the accumulation of myeloid cells at the site of the primary tumor leads to the stimulation of the metastatic spread of tumor cells (1). Furthermore,
myeloid cells also contributed to the formation of premetastatic niches by generating a favorable microenvironment
for accepting tumor cells at sites in distant organs (3, 45,
46). Increased levels of extracellular S100A4 stimulated the accumulation of T cells at the site of the primary tumor; furthermore, S100A4 +/+ MEF-mediated accumulation of T cells
occurred in premetastatic lungs. These observations allow
us to speculate that S100A4 contributes to the generation of
premetastatic niches. This could be achieved via attraction
of T cells to the secondary site or indirectly via the stimulation
of the production of cytokines (G-CSF) that will in turn attract
myeloid cells to the site of future metastases.
CD4+ T cells promote metastasis of mammary carcinoma by
enhancing the protumor activity of myeloid cells (6). We can
speculate that S100A4 mediates attraction and/or activation
of these T cells to promote metastatic spread. It could also
stimulate attraction of Gr-1+ CD11b+ myeloid precursors mediated by enhanced production of G-CSF (43).
Our data indicate that analogous process could occur in
the site of secondary tumor development, where increased
activity of S100A4 stimulates T-cell attraction, generates

inflammatory milieu, and thereby creates a favorable microenvironment to attract myeloid cells and generate a premetastatic niche. We propose therefore that lymphoid cells
along with cells of myeloid lineage could be important components of the premetastatic niche.
Here, we provide strong evidence that the generation of an
inflammatory milieu, including T cells and macrophages, in
the tumor microenvironment stimulated metastatic spread
of tumor cells.
