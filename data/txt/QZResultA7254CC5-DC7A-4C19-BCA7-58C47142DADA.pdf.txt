ABSTRACT
Recent studies show that the unfolded protein response (UPR) within the
endoplasmic reticulum is correlated with breast cancer drug resistance. In particular,
human X-box binding protein-1(XBP1), a transcription factor which participates
in UPR stress signaling, is reported to correlate with poor clinical responsiveness
to tamoxifen. In this study, we develop a tamoxifen-resistant MCF-7 cell line by
treating the cell line with low concentration of tamoxifen, and we find that XBP1 is
indeed up-regulated at both the mRNA and protein levels compared to normal MCF7 cells. STF-083010, a novel inhibitor which specifically blocks the XBP1 splicing,
reestablishes tamoxifen sensitivity to resistant MCF-7 cells. Moreover, co-treatment
with STF-083010 and tamoxifen can significantly delay breast cancer progression in
a xenograft mammary tumor model. We next investigate the expression of XBP1s in
over 170 breast cancer patients’ samples and the results demonstrate that XBP1s
expression level is highly correlated with overall survival in the ER+ subgroup, but not
in the ER− subgroup, suggesting a potential therapeutic application of XBP1 inhibitors
in ER+breast cancer treatment.

and clinicians. [1] The unfolded protein response
(UPR), a collective set of signaling pathways which is
activated by endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, has been
demonstrated to be one of the most important endocrine
treatment-resistant mechanisms and represents a potential
therapeutic target for tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer. [2]
However, the detailed mechanisms of how the three UPR
downstream branches (IRE1, PERK, and ATF6) integrate
their cyto-protective and proapoptotic outputs under ER
stress, such as hypoxia, starving or tamoxifen treatment,
are still unknown. [3] Some studies have suggested that
the ER transmembrane kinase/endoribonuclease (RNase)

INTRODUCTION
Tamoxifen (TAM) is one of the most frequently
used, and effective, endocrine treatment drugs, which
can reduce mortality and breast cancer recurrence in
patients with hormone receptor positive breast tumors.
Unfortunately, up to 50% of estrogen or progesterone
receptor positive breast cancers do not respond to
endocrine therapies, displaying de novo or intrinsic
resistance. Therefore, the development of novel and
efficient therapies for tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer
remains a major challenge for breast cancer researchers

RESULTS

IRE1alpha is a key component of the cell-fate switch for
UPR-triggered apoptosis or survival [4, 5].
XBP1 is reported to be an important regulator of the
UPR [5]. It has been shown that only the spliced form of
XBP1 (XBP1s) can induce the UPR efficiently. Moreover,
XBP1s is more stable, easier to transport and a stronger
transcriptional factor compared to its unspliced form,
XBP1u. [6]
Previous studies have demonstrated that XBP1
expression is increased in estrogen therapy resistant
breast cancer cell lines and is co-expressed with the
estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) in breast tumors.
[7, 8] Overexpression of XBP1s in ER-positive breast
cancer cells leads to estrogen-independent cell growth
and reduced sensitivity to growth inhibition induced
by tamoxifen and Faslodex independent of a functional
p53. [9] The ratios of XBP1s/XBP1u mRNA (indicating
enhanced splicing by IRE1) in 100 primary breast
cancer patients who received tamoxifen treatment were
measured by quantitative RT-PCR, and the result suggests
that higher ratios of XBP1s/XBP1u are correlated with
poorer survival [10]. Gene expression profile analysis
reveals that XBP1s acts through transcriptional regulation
of the estrogen receptor, the antiapoptotic gene BCL2,
and several other genes associated with cell cycle and
apoptosis. [11, 12]
XBP1s expression level may be one of the key
players in tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer, while IRE1,
the upstream nuclease which mediates the splicing of
XBP1 pre-mRNA, may be a potential target for reducing
resistance. Classical IRE1-XBP1 inhibitors, such as
sunitinib and AYP29, not only inhibit the kinase function
of IRE1but also activates its endonuclease activity,
which has no effect on XBP1in terms of expression. [13]
Intriguingly, a new type of IRE1-XBP1 inhibitor, STF083010, inhibits only IRE1 RNase activity but does not
alter the phosphorylation process, thus decreasing XBP1s
protein level. [14]
In this study, we demonstrate increased levels
of XBP1s both at the mRNA and protein level in a
tamoxifen-resistant MCF-7 cell line (termed MCF7TAMR hereafter) compared to normal MCF-7 cells
(termed control cells hereafter). Moreover, we also find
that STF-083010, a novel inhibitor which specifically
blocks XBP1 splicing, can re-establish MCF7-TAMR
cells’ sensitivity to tamoxifen treatment in vitro.
Furthermore, we demonstrate the synergistic effect of
STF-083010 and tamoxifen in controlling breast cancer
progression in a xenograft murine mammary cancer
model. Finally, we investigate XBP1s expression in
over 170 breast cancer patients’ samples, and show
that XBP1s expression is highly correlated with
overall survival in ER+ breast cancer patients, strongly
suggesting a potential therapeutic application of XBP1
inhibitors in breast cancer treatment.

Establishment of MCF7-TAMR and T47DTAMR cell lines
To develop a MCF7-TAMR cell line, we exposed
normal MCF-7 cells to a low concentration of tamoxifen
(1μM) for 30 days continuously and then compared the
viability of these treated cells to control cells at 1 μM,
2 μM and 4 μM tamoxifen. The results showed that the
MCF7-TAMR cells exhibited significantly less sensitivity
to tamoxifen treatment at all three concentrations compare
to the control cells (Figure 1a). Microscopic analysis was
used to assess the morphological changes upon tamoxifen
treatment; we found that control MCF-7 cells displayed
a highly round morphology, while the MCF7-TAMR
cells showed more branches and displayed a long, flat
morphology which were similar to normal tissue epithelia
(Figure 1b). We also developed T47D-TAMR cells by
exposing control T47D cells to 10 μM tamoxifen for 30
days continuously.

Elevated XBP1s level in the MCF7-TAMR and
T47D-TAMR cell lines
To compare XBP1 expression level between control
cells and tamoxifen resistant cells, we performed RTPCR to analyze the mRNA level of XBP1s and XBP1u,
and the XBP1s/ XBP1u ratio was used as a measure of
XBP1 splicing activity. We found that both in MCF7TAMR and T47D-TAMR cells, the XBP1s/ XBP1u ratio
was significantly higher than control cells (Figure  1c,
Supplementary Figure S1b), suggesting more efficient
XBP1 processing. Immunoblot analysis also showed
that the XBP1s protein level was significantly higher in
MCF7-TAMRcells and T47D-TAMR cells and in line with
this, the XBP1 upstream regulator, IRE1, showed higher
activity (increased phosphorylation) in MCF7-TAMR cells
and T47D-TAMR cells (Figure 1d, Supplementary Figure
S1c). We also investigated AKT and Caspase3 activities,
but no significant difference was found between control
cells and tamoxifen resistant cells. Interestingly, when
we treated MCF7-TAMR cells with 4 μM tamoxifen and
monitored the spliced XBP1s mRNA level, we found that
the XBP1s mRNA was increased in a time dependent
manner only in the MCF7-TAMRcells (Figure 1e),
suggesting that XBP1’s splicing was correlated with the
tamoxifen treatment in a time dependent manner.

The IRE1/XBP1 inhibitor, STF-080310, restores
tamoxifen sensitivity in MCF7-TAMR cells
STF-080310 is a novel IRE1/XBP1 inhibitor which
can specifically inhibit the RNase activity of IRE1without
affecting its kinase function (Figure 2a), and therefore

can block XBP1 splicing and decrease XBP1s levels.
[14]. Thapsigargin is a classical molecule which can
trigger endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and activate
XBP1 splicing. When we treated MCF7-TAMR cells with
thapsigargin, the XBP1 splicing was induced. However,
when we co-applied STF-080310 with thapsigargin, the
splicing process of XBP1 was efficiently blocked (Figure
2b, 2c), indicating that STF-080310 efficiently inhibits
XBP1 function. Indeed, when we treated MCF7-TAMR
cells with tamoxifen or STF-080310 separately, the cell
viability was not affected, but when the MCF7-TAMRcells
were treated with tamoxifen and STF-080310 together, the
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

cell viability was significantly reduced (Figure 2d). Taken
together, these results demonstrate that the IRE1/XBP1
inhibitor STF-080310 can restore tamoxifen sensitivity in
MCF7-TAMR cells.

into the dorsal flank of female nude mice. When tumors
reached approximately a size of 150 mm3, we divided
the tumor-bearing mice into 4 different groups: control
group (treated with DMSO); tamoxifen-treated group;
STF-080310-treated group and tamoxifen plus STF080310 treated group. Each group was comprised of at
least 7 mice and all the mice were treated for 3 weeks
(Figure 3a). When we isolated the tumors from the four
groups, the tamoxifen plus STF-080310-treated mice
had smaller tumors compared to the control group and to
the single drug treatment groups (Figure 3b). Moreover,
tumor growth curve indicated that tamoxifen plus STF080310-treated mice showed significantly slower tumor
progression compared to other 3 groups (Figure 3c), also
the tumor weight from the dual treatment of tamoxifen
and STF-080310 group were much less than other
groups (Figure 3d). These results demonstrated that
STF-080310 and tamoxifen had synergistic therapeutic
effects on tamoxifen-resistant breast tumors in vivo.

Furthermore, we investigated the pathological and
proliferation status of these tumors by H&E and Ki67
staining, but no significant difference were detected
among these groups (Supplementary Figure S2a, S2b),
however, we found dramatically more Caspase3 positive
staining in the tamoxifen and STF-080310 treated
tumors, suggesting more apoptotic cell death of tumor
cells in this group (Figure 3e, 3f). Finally, we analyzed
XBP1s expression levels in all the breast tumors by
immunohistochemistry and found that the XBP1s
expression was significantly inhibited in both groups
treated with STF-080310 alone or with STF080310
and tamoxifen. (Supplementary Figure S3), which
indicated that STF-080310 could efficiently inhibit
XBP1s’ expression in vivo. Taken all together, STF080310 can significantly reinstate tamoxifen sensitivity
in vivo by inhibiting XBP1s function and thus can be
used together with tamoxifen to efficiently delay breast
tumor progression.

Elevated XBP1s expression is highly correlated
with poor survival in ER+ breast cancer patients

investigated the correlation between XBP1s expression
and overall survival. The results indicated that for the high
XBP1s expression patients, the survival ratio was only
46.7%. Conversely, for low XBP1s expression patients
the survival ratio was 75%, which was significantly higher
than high expression patients (Figure 4b). Moreover, we
analyzed the correlation of XBP1s expression and survival
both in ER+ and ER− subgroups respectively, and found
that XBP1s expression was only associated with overall
survival in the ER+ group but not in the ER− group (Figure
4c, 4d).

Over 170 patients’ samples were collected for
immunohistochemistry analysis for XBP1s expression.
The patients had been categorized into different sub groups
according to their various characteristics. We established
standard protocols to define high and low expression
of XBP1s (see details in Materials and Method), and
representative images of high and low XBP1s expression
levels are shown in Figure 4a. Furthermore, we

cannot be used as an independent prognostic factor.

All the patients were categorized according to their
pathological grade, clinical stage, as well as their ER,
PR and HER2 status (Figure 5). We analyzed different
prognostic factors and found that only in ER+ groups did
XBP1s expression as well as pathological levels, tumor
size, T stage, N stage, TNM stage significantly affect
overall survival. However, in the ER− group, all these
factors had no correlation with overall survival by Logrank test (Table 1). Multivariate Cox regression analysis
in ER+ and ER− groups are displayed in Table 2. In the ER+
group, XBP1s expression had no statistically significant
contribution to prognosis (P = 0.074) although the relative
risk was obviously high (2.539, 95%CI 0.931–7.059). The
only factor that had statistical significance in this group
was tumor size (P = 0.039), with a RR of 2.943 (95%CI
1.056–8.200). However, none of these factors displayed

DISCUSSION

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Endocrine therapy is the most efficient systemic
therapy for estrogen receptor positive breast cancer;
however, many ER+ breast cancer patients can acquire
resistance to endocrine therapy. Previous studies have
shown that this resistance is associated with the UPR
response and elevated signal transduction pathways
such as the EGFR/MAPK, PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways
[15]. Alternative treatments include applying different
endocrine drugs such as anastrozole and fulvestrant; or
combinational endocrine therapy with small molecular
inhibitors such as gefitinib, lapatinib and everolimus [16].
Clinical studies have shown that aromatase inhibitors
(AIs) can significantly increase the therapeutic efficiency
of postmenopausal breast cancer patients who have
tamoxifen resistance. Even among those patients who
40697

status, PR status and HER2 status.

got no therapeutic effects with AIs, 30% of them can
benefit with subsequent usage of fulvestrant [17, 18].
It is also reported that mTOR inhibitors in combination
with exemestane can improve progression-free survival
in postmenopausal breast cancer patients. [15] In vitro
studies show that mTOR inhibitors combined with
tamoxifen can increase toxicity by killing up to 56% more
ER+ breast tumor cells than the single drug treatment [19].
Despite these inspiring data, clinical trials evaluating the
combination of endocrine therapy and trastuzumab or the
TKIs, like gefitinib, erlotinib and lapatinib, have produced
various results. [20, 21] Nevertheless, tamoxifen is still
the most important endocrine therapy for premenopausal
breast cancer patients, therefore it is important and urgent
to investigate the mechanisms involved in breast tumor
cell resistance to tamoxifen and to establish new treatment
strategies.
Human X-box binding protein-1 (XBP1) is an
alternatively spliced transcription factor that participates
in a stress-signaling pathway to protect cells from damage.
It has also been reported that XBP1 is involved in the
unfolded protein response (UPR) and ER stress response
under the control of IRE1. Clarke et.al found that overexpression of the spliced variant of the gene in estrogen
receptor-positive breast cancer cells led to reduced
sensitivity to tamoxifen and faslodex. Subsequent studies
reported that XBP1s expression in ER+ breast tumors
correlated with poor clinical responsiveness to tamoxifen,

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

however, the underlying signaling mechanisms affected
by XBP1s, as well as the effects of splicing on antiestrogen resistance, remain unclear. It is hypothesized that
XBP1s mediates anti-estrogen resistance in part through
regulating nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) signaling.
Overexpression of XBP1 in MCF7 and LCC1 antiestrogen-sensitive breast cancer cells resulted primarily in
an increase in XBP1s and an induction of RelA expression
at both the mRNA and protein levels [22] Chen et.al
reported that XBP1 was activated in triple negative breast
cancer, a highly aggressive malignant subtype of breast
cancer. They found that deletion of XBP1inhibited both
tumor growth and tumor relapse as well as decreased the
CD44high CD24low cell population by inhibiting the HIF
pathway. [23]
In our study, we established a MCF7-TAMR cell
line by long-term, low concentration exposure of MCF-7
cell to tamoxifen. Cell viability assays showed that the
MCF7-TAMR cells’ sensitivity to tamoxifen was reduced
by 1.7 ~ 2.4 fold compare to control cells; this was also
confirmed by morphological analysis. The method of low
concentration tamoxifen exposure to induce cell resistance
to tamoxifen is a reasonable and efficient way of studying
drug resistance in vitro, which essentially mimics the reallife clinical situation drug resistance occurs, as most drug
resistance is induced by long term drug usage.
We next investigated the expression levels of XBP1
and its upstream regulator, IRE1, in the MCF7-TAMR cell

lines, and showed that the expression level of both XBP1s
and p-IRE1 were increased significantly. Importantly, this
enhanced expression occurred shortly after tamoxifen
was given and in a concentration-dependent manner.
Although there may be other pathways affected in the
MCF7-TAMRcells, we conclude that the up-regulation
of IRE1-XBP1 is at least partially associated with the
reduced sensitivity to tamoxifen, and that the UPR and
ER stress responses are activated in MCF7-TAMR cells.
Indeed, we compared gene expression profiles between

MCF7-TAMR cells and control cells using a next
generation sequencing approach and a new bioinformatics
model, the result showed 1215mRNA and 513 small RNA
transcripts were changed which could be clustered into ER
functions, cell cycle regulation, transcription/translation,
and mitochondrial dysfunction.
To validate our findings, we next used a novel
IRE1-XBP1 inhibitor, STF-083010, to treat the MCF7TAMRcells. STF083010 is an inhibitor of IRE1α
endonuclease activity; which can block endogenous XBP1

mRNA splicing and displays cytostatic and cytotoxic
effects in CD138+ multiple myeloma (MM) cells in vitro
[14], STF083010 is also reported to inhibit bortezomibinduced XBP1 activity in myeloma xenografts in vivo
but does not alter IRE1α kinase activity [24]. Our in vitro
experiments showed that STF-083010 could specifically
inhibit XBP1 splicing and increased the sensitivity of the
MCF7-TAMRcells to tamoxifen by up to 60%. We also
injected MCF7-TAMRcells into nude mice to study STF083010 function in vivo. Not surprisingly, the combinatory
treatment of STF-083010 and tamoxifen could reduce
tumor weight and tumor diameter by up to 75% and 38.3%
respectively when compared to single-drug treatment
groups. As described previously [13, 14], STF-083010is
a novel IRE1-XBP1 inhibitor which inhibits the RNase
activity of IRE1 but without affects its kinase functions,
thereby specifically regulating downstreamXBP1s
expression while greatly minimizing undesired sideeffects. We believe that the decreased XBP1s expression
level induced by STF-083010 somehow restored the tumor
sensitivity to tamoxifen, however, we cannotexclude other
factors which might contribute to this striking therapeutic
result, and the detailed mechanism of how STF-083010 reestablishes the sensitivity of resistant tumors to tamoxifen
in vivo needs to be further investigated.
As XBP1s has been implied to play a key role in
drug resistance in certain subtypes of breast cancers
[23], we systematically reviewed breast cancer patients’
samples regarding XBP1s expression. Intriguingly, we
found thatXBP1s expression was correlated with overall
survival not only in the ER+ patients, but also among all
breast cancer patients when we pooled them together. Our
data demonstrates that high XBP1s expression levels lead
to poor survival after endocrine therapy, which suggests
that XBP1s could be considered as a prognosis factor and
contribute to drug resistance in the clinic. Therefore, small
molecular inhibitors such as STF083010, which targets
IRE1-XBP1, may have potential therapeutic effects for
endocrine therapy resistant patients.
In essence, IRE1-XBP1 plays an essential role in the
UPR and ER stress responses, which have been implicated
in the development of drug resistance. Our data suggests
that a combination of IRE1-XBP1 inhibitors and endocrine
therapy would be an alternative strategy for breast cancer
therapy in the future.

tamoxifen-resistant cells, the MCF-7 cells were cultured
in the same conditions supplemented with 1 μM 4-OH
tamoxifen (Sigma Aldrich) for 30 days and the T47D cells
were incubated with 10 μM 4-OH tamoxifen for 30 days
respectively.

Quantitative RT-PCR
Total RNA was prepared from control and
tamoxifen-resistant MCF-7 cells using the RNeasy Mini
Kit (Qiagen) in accordance with the manufacturer’s
instructions. Total RNA (1 μg) was subjected to reverse
transcription using random hexamers (Roche) and
SuperscriptII (Invitrogen) followed by quantitative PCR
analysis. The following primers were used:
XBP1
spliced:
5′-GGTCTGCTGAGTCCG
CAGCAGG-3′

and
5′GGGCTTGGTATATATGTGG-3′ (reverse)
XBP1 total (XBP1 spliced+XBP1 unspliced): 5′CGGAAGCCAAGGGGAATGAA-3′ (forward) and 5′GTCCAGAATGCCCAACAGGA-3′ (reverse)
GAPDH: 5′- GAAGGTGAAGGTCGGAGTC-3′
(forward) and 5′- GAAGATGGTGATGGGATTTC-3′
(reverse).

Western blot analysis
Approximately 2 × 106 cells of each cell line were
prepared overnight in 6-well plates. The next day, the
supernatant was discarded and the cells were washed
twice with PBS. Next the cells were lysed with appropriate
RIPA buffer containing 1%PMSF, placed 20 min on ice
and scraped using cell scraper. After 20 min incubation,
cells/lysates were collected and transferred into tubes and
centrifuged at 12,000g at 4°C for 10 min. The supernatant
was pipetted into new tubes and the protein concentrations
were determined by the BCA method (Thermo Scientific).
Equal amount of protein (40 ug) of lysates were used for
electrophoresis using Nu-Page 10% Bis-Tris gels and
blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes
were washed briefly in TBS/0.1% Tween-20 (TBST),
pH 7.4, and blocked in 5% milk or 5% BSA (diluted in
TBST) for 1 h. The membranes were thenincubated with
the following antibodies: XBP1s primary antibody (1:500;
Abcam, 198999), XBP1u (1:1000, Abcam, abab37152),
p-IRE1 (1:1000; Abcam, ab104157), IRE1 (1:1000; Cell
Signaling, #3294), p-AKT (1:1000; Cell signaling, #9611),
AKT (1:4000; Cell Signaling,#2944), Caspase3 (1:2000, Cell
signaling,#9665), GADPH (1:5000; Cell Signaling, #5174)
diluted in blocking solution overnight. Blots were then
washed with TBST for 5 min three times and incubated in
corresponding secondary antibody (1:20000; Cell Signaling,
#7071, #7072) for 1 h. The membranes were processed with
ECL-plus (Pierce, 32132) and then exposed on films in a
dark room and the films were scanned by software Quantity
One (Bio-Rad) and quantified by densitometry.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
MCF-7 cell cultures, T47D cell cultures and

and Technology University (HUST) Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee. Briefly, 4 * 106 tamoxifenresistant MCF-7 cells were injected subcutaneously into the
flankof 4-week-old female nude mice (Animal experiment
center of Tongji Medical College, HUST, WuHan, China).
4 days later, all the mice were divided into four groups
randomly and treated with: 1) DMSO, 2) TAM 100ug/
kg per day, 3) STF-083010 30mg/kg per week, 4) TAM
combined with STF-083010 by intraperitoneal injection.
Three weeks after injection, animals were killed and the
four groups of tumors were examined. Tumor growth was
evaluated by measuring tumor weight.

Cell viabilities were determined by the MTT assay.
Cells were seeded into 96-well culture plates with 0.5%
fetus serum medium and started to adhere after 2–4 hours.
Then the cells were treated with different conditions. After
the treatment, cells were incubated with MTT working
solution (Roche). The cell viabilities were determined by
acquiring the OD value at 540 nm after incubation 4–6
hours in MTT. The relative viability was determined by
OD value of experiment group/control group × 100%.

Immunohistochemistry

Patients and samples

Immunohistochemical analysis for XBP1s in breast
tumor mice or patients was performed in a standard protocol.
Briefly, 2 μm sections were obtained from formalin fixed and
paraffin embedded tumor samples, sections were dehydrated
and antigenic epitopes retrieved using a 10-mM citrate buffer
and microwaving for 10 minutes. Specimens were stained
with XBP1s antibody (1:100, abcam, ab37152), primary
antibody staining was detected by peroxidase conjugated
anti-rabbit IgG according to manufacturer’s instructions
(Roche). The ER, PR, and Her-2/neu staining were
previously performed and recorded after initial surgery was
done. The immunohistochemical expression of XBP1s was
examined by light microscopy through calculating 1000 cells
per 5 sights. The percentage of positive cells, as the extent of
immunostaining, was quantified under the microscope and
classified into five groups. 0: < 5% positive cells; 1: 5% to
24% positive cells; 2: 25% to 49% positive cells; 3: 50%
to 74% positive cells and 4: > 75% positive cells. Intensity
was scored as 0 for absence of staining, 1 for weak, 2 for
moderate, and 3 for strong staining. The score of the intensity
plus the percentage of positive staining were used to define
expression levels. 0–1: negative; 2–3: little positive (+1); 4–5:
moderately positive (+2); 6–7: strongly positive (+3). Lastly,
a total score calculated by the product of staining intensity
and positive percentage was used to divide all specimens
into two groups: a low-expression group (0–5 scores) and a
high-expression group (6–12 scores). Immunhistochemical
staining was done using an automatic staining machine (Leica
Bond3) or manually processed. Sections were dehydrated
and antigenic epitopes were retrieved using a 10-mM citrate
buffer and microwaving for 10 min. Specimen were then
incubated with rabbit anti-Ki67 (Novocastra, 1:200), anticleaved caspase-3 (Cell Signaling, 9661, 1:200). Primary Ab
staining was detected by peroxidase conjugated anti-rabbit
IgG (DAKO, P0448, 1:500). Positive cells were counted on
20 randomly chosen tumor areas at ×400 magnifications in a
double blinded fashion.

A total of 170 invasive breast cancer patients who
underwent surgery at hospitalsof Jiangsu, Zhejiang and
Shanghai that cooperated with National Engineering
Center for Biochip at Shanghai during 2001–2004 were
selected. 164 patients remained when six were discarded
from the analysis due to lack of follow-up or lack of
data. The age of patients ranged from 29 to 82 years
old. Clinic-pathological characteristics are presented in
Table 1. ER or PR-positive breast cancers were supposed
to use tamoxifen as endocrine therapy under standard
treatment.

Statistical analyses
All statistical analyses were performed using
SPSS16.0 software and the detail methods were indicated
in figure legend. Survival curves were calculated using
the Kaplan-Meier method, with the significance evaluated
using the Mantel-Cox long-rank test. The prognostic
significance of the parameters was assessed using the Cox
proportional hazards model with overall survival as an
end point. A multivariate analysis was performed using
Cox model; previously identified prognostic factors in
breast cancer were included in the model. The relations
of XBP1s expression and clinic-pathological parameters
were measured using the nonparametric KrusKal-Wallis
and Mann-Whitney methods, using Spearman’s correlation
analysis. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Correlations with numerical variables were analyzed by
Mann-Whitney U test.
