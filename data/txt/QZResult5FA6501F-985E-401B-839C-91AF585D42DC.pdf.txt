ABSTRACT
Cofilin, an actin-binding protein which disassembles actin filaments, plays
an important role in invasion and metastasis. Here, we discover that JG6, an
oligomannurarate sulfate, binds to cofilin, suppresses the migration of human breast
cancer cells and cancer metastasis in breast cancer xenograft model. Mechanistically,
JG6 occupies actin-binding sites of cofilin, thereby disrupting cofilin modulated actin
turnover. Our results highlight the significance of cofilin in cancer and suggest JG6,
a cofilin inhibitor, to treat metastatic cancer.

INTRODUCTION

and determines cell polarity[7, 8]. This relocalization
is critical for the regulation of cell motility and cellular
processes such as chemotaxis, endocytosis, and cell
division, which are important for both cell physiology and
cancer development.
Although there is as yet no direct evidence for a role
of deregulated cofilin activity in the etiology of human
cancers, the increased activity of the cofilin pathway and
its output has been demonstrated in cancer cells[9]. There
are at least three stages of cancer progression in which
cofilin and its regulation are likely to be important: the
initial process of cell transformation[10], increased cell
motility during metastasis [11, 12], and cell division[13].
Results to date also indicate that cofilin might be closely
involved in cancer development[14, 15]. These together
suggest the therapeutic opportunities of targeting cofilin in
cancer therapy. In a cofilin-orientated anti-cancer strategy,
it is important to note that functional cofilin located at
the dynamic protrusion is only a very small proportion of
total cofilin, and several tightly uncoupled mechanisms
are involved in regulating cofilin activity, which may
pose challenges for its effective intervention in cancer
therapy[15].
JG6 (Fig. 1A), a novel marine-derived
oligosaccharide previously discovered binding to
extracellular factors and inhibit chemotaxis[16], was noted

Cancer metastasis constitutes the major cause
of death in cancer patients. The cellular basis of cancer
invasion and metastasis is the up-regulated cell motility
of cancer cells, which is the hallmark of invasion and
an essential step in metastasis[1]. Targeting tumor cell
migration or invasion is a potential strategy for antimetastasis[2, 3]. The multi-step cell migration of invasive
and metastatic cancer cells is initiated by the formation
of membrane protrusions in response to migratory and
chemotactic stimuli. The driving force for such membrane
protrusion is localized polymerization of submembrane
actin filaments[4, 5].
Actin framework is widely accepted as the basic
engine for cell motility. The molecular machinery
controlling the assembly/disassembly of actin filaments
consists of several actin-binding proteins that regulate
the dynamic behavior of actin cytoskeleton. Of them,
the ubiquitously distributed cofilin protein is the most
important regulator for accelerating actin-filament
turnover and generating free barbed ends by facilitating
pointed end depolymerization and filament severing[6].
In migrating or invading cells, cofilin is localized to the
protrusion of the cell membrane such as lamellipodia,
invadopodia and filopodia that initiates cell movements

in an affinity chromatography analysis that indicated its
binding affinity to cofilin. The aims of the present study
were to further validate the intracellular targets of JG6
and assess the potential anti-migration and anti-metastasis
activities of JG6. Our studies have demonstrated that JG6
suppresses the depolymerization/severing activities of
cofilin on F-actin via occupying the actin-binding sites
of cofilin, which largely accounts for the suppression of
breast cancer migration by JG6. Our results promise JG6
in particular and oligosaccharide possibly in general, to
be a new and hitherto unrecognized therapeutic class in
cancer therapy, and further support cofilin as an emerging
target in cancer therapy.

JG6 binds to cofilin and inhibits its actin-severing
activity
Our pilot experiment using JG6 affinity
chromatography in combined with liquid chromatographytandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis
has suggested that JG6, a novel marine-derived
oligosaccharide possessing interesting bioactivities, binds
to actin-regulating protein cofilin (Table. S1). Before
proceeding to confirming the intracellular binding of JG6

were seeded and 100 μg/ml JG6-FITC was added. After incubated with JG6-FITC for the indicated time, cells were harvested and

independent experiments. (C) Cancer cells were seeded and 100 μg/ml JG6-FITC was added. Before and after the addition of JG6-FITC,

to cofilin, we first tested whether JG6 was able to enter
the cells. JG6 was visualized by conjugated to fluorescein
isothiocyanate (FITC). Flow cytometry analysis showed
that fluorescent intensity of both MDA-MB-435 and
MTLn3 cells treated with JG6-FITC was increased (Fig.
1B), indicating a significant amount of JG6 binding to or
enter these cells. Further experiment using fluorescence
microscopy analysis indicated the entry of JG6 into these
cancer cells (Fig. 1C).
We then took the advantage of a specific antibody
raised against JG6 to verify its binding to cofilin in
cancer cells. Immunoprecipitaion was performed using
JG6 antibody in cellular extracts derived from breast
adenocarcinoma MTLn3 cells, which were pretreated with
100 μg/ml JG6 for 24 hours. The presence of cofilin in the
immunoprecipitates was examined using immunoblotting.
Cofilin was clearly detected in the complexes pulled down

by JG6 antibody. Moreover, it appeared that JG6 bound
equally to un-phosphorylated and phosphorylated forms of
cofilin (Fig. 1D and 1E), suggesting that phosphorylation
signaling is not involved in JG6 binding. We then were
intrigued to investigate the biological significance behind.
Cofilin is known to importantly regulate the
dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton via its actin-severing
and depolymerization activity[17, 18]. We firstly
examined whether JG6 treatment affected the severing
and depolymerization activity of cofilin. Polymerized
actin was incubated with purified cofilin to initiate
depolymerization, which was detected by the decline in
fluorescence. JG6 treatment markedly suppressed the
depolymerizing/severing activities of cofilin, as shown
by a reduced decrease in fluorescence intensity compared
with the untreated group (P < 0.01) (Fig. 1F). This finding
suggested that binding of JG6 to cofilin impaired the

immunoprecipitation using anti-cofilin antibody and then subjected to immunoblotting analysis for actin. (E) MDA-MB-435 and MTLn3

fibers in cancer cells[23]. We thus examined the impact
of JG6 on stress fibers. The stress fibers in the breast
cancer cells were visualized by conjugating actin to green
fluorescent protein (GFP). Live cell imaging in GBAMTLn3 cells expressing GFP-actin showed that few actin
stress fibers were observed in the control groups whereas
fan-shaped stress fibers were scattered all around GBAMTLn3 cells after exposure to JG6 (Fig. 2C), suggesting
that JG6 treatment significantly increased the formation of
cellular stress fibers.
Our results thus far have suggested that JG6 binds to
cofilin and inhibits its actin-severing and depolymerization
activity. It has been known that F-actin depolymerizing/
severing activities of cofilin are regulated at the binding
sites. We thus presumed that JG6 might compete with
actin in accessing to binding sites of cofilin. To test
this possibility, we measured the effect of JG6 on the
interaction between cofilin and actin. MTLn3 cells
were incubated with JG6 100 μg/ml for 24 hours. The

JG6 disrupts cofilin-actin interaction
The reduction in the rate of actin depolymerization
suggests a blockage in reorganizing F-actin into
monomeric G-actin molecules. We hence assessed the
effect of JG6 on the ratio of G-actin to F-actin[19-22].
MDA-MB-435 and MTLn3 breast cancer cells were
fractionated into supernatant and pellets to measure the
proportion of F-actin to G-actin. As shown in Fig. 2A
and 2B, JG6 treatment increased F-/G-actin ratios in both
MDA-MB-435 and MTLn3 cells compared to those of
untreated control cells. The increase in F-/G-actin ratio
was attributed to the increase in F-actin whereas decrease
in G-actin levels.
Defect in actin depolymerization may also result in
the accumulation of actin filament in the form of stress

detection of actin-cofilin interaction was facilitated by
serum stimulation, which was known to accelerate the
dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton and in turn increase
its interaction with cofilin[9]. Cell lytase was analyzed by
immunoprecipitation using anti-cofilin antibody and then
subjected to immunoblotting analysis for actin. The coimmunoprecipitation assay revealed that JG6 treatment
disrupted actin-cofilin interaction in the presence of serum
stimulation (Fig. 2D).
In addition to cofilin, the assembly and disassembly
of actin filaments are regulated by a variety of actinbinding proteins. We also investigated the impact of JG6
on these proteins. As shown in Fig. 2E, JG6 treatment
barely affected other actin binding proteins or their
phosphorylation in both MDA-MB-435 and MTLn3 cells.
It suggests to us that JG6 can disrupt the interaction
between cofilin and actin, and thereby inhibit actin
turnover by restricting actin depolymerization.

binding sites and possible binding mode of JG6 to cofilin.
A JG6 trimmer was selected as the docking probe. Our
results indicated that JG6 binds to the actin-binding pocket
of cofilin with high affinity. A close-up view of the binding
interface was developed for an improved resolution (Fig.
3A). It was found that JG6 entered the actin-binding
pocket of cofilin and docked on amino acids E42, K44,
E50, K53 and D79 by forming hydrogen bonds.
Based on the simulation prediction, the impacts
of these suggested amino acids on JG6 binding was
examined. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) assay was
utilized to measure the binding affinity of JG6 to E42A,
K44A, D79A, E42A/D79A and K44A/D79A cofilin
mutants, which were expressed and purified in E. coli
cells. It was revealed that only K44A/D79A among the 5
mutants significantly disrupted JG6 binding, resulting in
nearly a 3600-fold decrease in binding affinity to JG6 (Fig.
3B and 3C). Meanwhile, none of the mutants affected the
actin-binding and severing and depolymerization activities
of cofilin (Fig. 3D).
For further confirmation, we examined whether
introduction of K44A/D79A mutants would eliminate
the impact of JG6 on actin polymerization. MTLn3

cells were transfected with cofilin siRNA to eliminate
endogenous cofilin. Silent mutations were introduced
to wildtype cofilin and K44A/D79A mutant to generate
resistance to siRNA disruption. By measuring F-actin/Gactin ratio in cells transfected with wildtype cofilin and
K44A/D79A mutant, we found that K44A/D79A mutant
also completely eliminated JG6 modulated F-actin/G-actin
ratio change (Fig. 3E).
All the data above support a mechanism that JG6
binds to cofilin, blocks the actin binding pocket, disrupts
the interaction between cofilin and actin, and thereby
hinders cofilin-dependent actin organization.

To further determine whether JG6 suppressed cell
migration was mediated by impaired function of cofilin,
cofilin was knocked down using siRNA in MTLn3 cells,
which yielded an 80% reduction in cofilin level (Fig.
4C). Effects of JG6 on cell migration were dramatically
reduced in cofilin-depleted cells (Fig. 4D and 4E). Further,
introduction of K44A/D79A mutant into cofilin-depleted
cells remarkably rescued JG6 suppressed breast cancer cell
migration (Fig. 4F and 4G). It was interesting to note that
siRNA-medicated depletion or overexpression of cofilin
barely affected cell mobility. We speculate that functional
cofilin located at the dynamic protrusion represents only
a very small proportion of cofilin pool in the cell. The
alteration of its protein level, rather than disrupting its
activity, may not be able to affect its functional output.
In addition to cell migration, cofilin activity is
required for determining the direction of the protrusion
in chemotaxis responding to chemotactic stimulation [12].
In a chemotaxis assay, control cells exhibited protrusion
toward a gradient of EGF (the white asterisk indicated
the position of the pipette) whereas treatment with JG6
eliminated protrusion toward the EGF source (Fig. S2).
These data collectively suggested that JG6 suppressed cell
migration was medicated by impaired function of cofilin.

JG6 suppresses cofilin-mediated cell migration
The defects in actin cytoskeleton organization are
known to result in impaired migration of cancer cells. We
investigated the impact of JG6 on the migration of breast
cancer cells in vitro using a Transwell assay. As shown
in Fig. 4A and 4B, in the absence of JG6, MDA-MB-435
or MTLn3 cells freely passed into the lower chamber.
12-hours treatment with JG6 at doses of 50, 100, and
200 μg/ml significantly and dose-dependently reduced
the number of migrated cells. 200 μg/ml of JG6 yielded
75.3 % (MTLn3) and 66.9 % (MDA-MB-435) inhibition
compared with the untreated control (P < 0.001).
Meanwhile, JG6 treatment exhibited negligible cytotoxic
effects on 6 different breast cancer cell lines (Fig. S1),
suggesting that JG6 significantly inhibited migration of
breast cancer cells without affecting cell viability.

JG6 inhibits breast cancer metastasis
Cell migration is critically required for the complex,
multistep process of cancer metastasis [24, 25]. We
finally intended to explore therapeutic chances of JG6
in overcoming metastasis of cancer. The anti-metastasis
effect of JG6 was examined using a spontaneous
metastasis assay. Hypodermic injection and inoculum
of human breast cancer MDA-MB-435 cells into female
athymic nude mice caused a significant increase in the
number of pulmonary metastatic nodules. In contrast, daily
subcutaneous (s.c.) administration of JG6 for 6 weeks (10
and 20 mg/kg) caused a dramatic and dose-dependent
decrease in the number of pulmonary metastatic nodules,
yielding inhibition rates of 46.9% and 68.8%, respectively
(Fig. 5A and 5B). JG6-treated mice survived the whole
study (except one died of operation mistake) and showed
no signs of toxicity or body weight loss throughout
the experiments (Table. S2). These results suggest the
potential of JG6 in cancer therapy via hindering cancer
metastasis.

Dynamic cytoskeletal changes, as the foundation
of cell structure, morphology and motility, are critical
for cell-matrix interactions, focal contact disassembly,
chemotaxis and invasion. To switch from a stationary
state to a migratory state, the actin cytoskeleton has to
be reorganized from F-actin in the form of stress fibers

to G-actin monomers, and successively high order
structures[20]. Assembly of actin filaments from their
monomeric subunits can suffice to produce a protrusion,
which is often the first step in cell locomotion. To disturb
the actin dynamic will reduce cell motility[26].
Despite the apparently essential role in modulating
cell mobility, the strategy to manipulate actin dynamics
for cancer therapy appeared more complicated than
expected. So far, only a few peptide or depsipeptide
families have been reported to successfully inhibit actin
depolymerization[27]. The most well-known class of
compounds, including phalloidin and jasplakinolide,
does so by binding to a well-characterized phalloidinbinding site on actin[28, 29]. In contrast to the diverse
drugs targeting tubulin, therapeutic development of
this class of compounds has been restricted due to the
associated adverse effects of pulmonary edema and
hemorrhage[30], which is recognized as a result of
interference with the phalloidin-binding site on actin[31,
32]. Therefore, compounds circumventing direct actinbinding sites may increase the therapeutic opportunities
by avoiding such adverse effects. In the present study,
we have identified a marine-derived oligosaccharide JG6
that can effectively inhibit actin depolymerization, which
was further translated into potent inhibitory effects on
cell migration and tumor metastasis with little toxicity.
Mechanistic studies have revealed that the actin-binding
protein cofilin is the cellular target of JG6. JG6 blocks the
interaction between cofilin and actin and hence disrupts
cofilin modulated actin dynamics. Target validation of
JG6 in vivo at the moment will be technically challenging.
Molecular imaging of JG6 by conjugating to fluorescein
could be an option. Our findings may highlight the
strategy of targeting actin-binding proteins, such as cofilin
or cofilin regulators such as LIMK1/2[33, 34], rather than
actin itself for cancer therapy.
JG6 is structurally characterized as a 1, 4-linked
β-D-mannurarate of pyranohexuronic acid residues,
bearing an average of 1.5 sulfates per sugar residue at the
2-hydroxyl, partial 3-hydroxyl and 6-carboxyl groups,
with an additional C1 carboxyl group at the reducing end.
This structure endows JG6 appreciable negative charges,
which may allow JG6 forming a high-affinity interaction
with cofilin. Our results from molecular docking and
mutagenesis studies identified the amino acids of cofilin
critical for its interaction with JG6. Interestingly, these
amino acids are located at the actin binding pocket of
cofilin. These findings support a model that JG6 competes
with actin in the interaction with cofilin. It is worthwhile
to mention that although electrostatic charges initiate
attachments between sugars and proteins, the structurebased conformation is more likely to dominate the
ultimate outcomes. We have found that some other marinederived oligosaccharides, with the same negative charges
as JG6 but different sugar compositions, did not exhibit
the same effect as JG6 (unpublished data). Though the
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

structural components responsible for interactions between
cofilin and sulfated oligosaccharides have not been well
characterized, sugar backbone, distribution of sulfation
as well as chain length seems important. With studies
continuing to explore the structure-based mechanisms
of action of JG6, it is hoped that these results will add
impetus to the search for cofilin-targeted carbohydratebased anti-cancer agents. Our study provides important
insights into oligosaccharides as a new and hitherto
unrecognized therapeutic class[36]. The unique affinity
to proteins of this class of compounds may open new
therapeutic opportunities, in particular for those targets
challenging to access by small-molecule inhibitors.
Taken together, this study demonstrates for the
first time that an oligosaccharide JG6 binds cofilin at the
actin binding pocket and thereby inhibits actin turnover
by restricting actin depolymerization. This mechanism
allows JG6 anti-metastasis efficacy and highlights JG6 as
a lead molecule in cancer therapy. In addition, our results
identify cofilin as a key regulator in motility-driven cancer
metastasis, which reinforces the view that cofilin may be a
tractable and attractive target for cancer therapy.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Materials
JG6 was obtained by semisynthesis following
sulfate modification by reacting its precursor with ClSO3H
in formamide. Briefly, oligomannurarate was added to
sulfating reagents containing formamide and ClSO3H, and
reacted for 3 hours. The pH of the products was adjusted
to 7.0 with 4 mol/L NaOH and desalted with Sephadex
G-10. The product peak was pooled and freezedried. The
molecular weights of JG6 and its precursor were analyzed
by high-performance gel permeation chromatography
with a G3000PW×l column (300 mm×7.8 mm) (TOSOH,
Japan). Cofilin, p-cofilin, Erizin, p-Erizin, p-VASP
antibodies were from Cell Signaling Technology (Actin
Reorganization Antibody Sampler Kit #9967); PLCγ1
(#2822) and p-PLCγ1 (#2821) antibodies were from
Cell Signaling Technology. N-WASP (sc-20770), Arp2
(sc-15389), Arp3 (sc-15390), β-Actin(sc-130301),
GAPDH (sc-166574) antibodies were from Santa Cruz
Biotechnology: JG6 mAb was generated by hybridoma
fusions of BALB/C mouse spleen cells and NS-1 myeloma
cells. This mAb displays high affinity for JG6 with a KD
value of 2.3×10-9 M, as determined using SPR. Analysis
of the rate of cross-reactivity in an ELISA assay showed
that the mAb did not react with the carrier proteins, BSA
or OVA.

presence or absence of JG6 with serum-free culture media.
The lower compartment contained 600 μL of complete
culture media supplemented with 10% FBS. After
12-hours incubation at 37°C, cells were fixed and stained
with 0.1% crystal violet. The inhibition rate was calculated
as:[1-( JG6 treated group/ control group)] × 100%.

Cell Culture

E. coli BL21 transformants harboring the
expression vectors pBAD-His-cofilin or cofilin mutation
were cultured in RM media (1× M9 salts-2% Casamino
acids-1 mM MgCl2) plus 0.2% glucose with 150 μg/
mL ampicillin at 37 °C in a buffered flask with constant
shaking at 300 rpm, until the cell cultures reached an
OD600 of 0.8. L-(+)-arabinose was added to culture to
a final concentration 0.2% (w/v), and the cell cultures
were then allowed to grow for an additional 4 h at 30 °C.
Cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 3,000 × g for 15
min, washed once in half of the original volume with 10
mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 0.1 M NaCl. Cell
pellets were resuspended in 1:20 of the original volume
in extraction buffer containing 50 mM K3PO4, pH 8.0, 10
μM PLP, 0.1 M NaCl, 1 mM PMSF, 2 mM EDTA, and
protease inhibitor. The cells were lysed by sonication.
The precipitate was removed by centrifugation. The
supernatant was applied to Ni-NTA agarose column.
After the column was washed with washing buffer (20
mM Na3PO4, 500 mM NaCl, pH 6.0) three times, the Hiscofilin proteins were eluted with elution buffers that had
increasing imidazole concentrations at 500 mM.

Human breast carcinoma cells MCF-7, MDAMB-231, MDA-MB-468, MDA-MB-435 and BT-474
were obtained from ATCC and maintained in appropriate
medium as suggested by ATCC. MTLn3 and GBAMTLn3 cells (gifts of professor John S. Condeelis, Albert
Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY), rat mammary
adenocarcinoma cell lines described by Chan et al.[35],
were grown in α-MEM containing 5% FBS.

FCM analysis
JG6-f﻿﻿luorescein-5-isothiocyanate (FITC) was used
to detect the binding and entry of JG6 to cells. MDAMB-435 and MTLn3 cells were plated into 6-well plates
incubated at 37°C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2
for 24 hours and then 100 μg/mL JG6-FITC was added.
After incubated with JG6-FITC for the indicated time,
cells were harvested and washed three times with PBS,
then analyzed by FCM with a 488-nm laser excitation
and a 513-nm emission filter. Data were analyzed with
CellQuest software. For live cell fluorescence analysis,
cells were seed into Nunc™ glass bottom dishes for 24
hours. Before and after the addition of JG6-FITC, cells
were analyzed and photographed under a f﻿﻿luorescence

SPR assay

Co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP)

SPR biosensor measurements (Bio-Rad ProteOn
XPR36) were used to evaluate the interactions between
JG6 and cofilin or cofilin mutants. In this assay, 10 mM
Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing cofilin or cofilin
mutants at concentrations of 0.312, 0.625, 1.25, 2.5, or
5 µM were passed over the JG6 sensor chip surface for 2
minutes at a flow rate of 5 µl/min. Changes in mass were
measured, and the sensorgrams were recorded in real time
and analyzed after subtracting the control.

For total protein extraction, the indicated cell lines
were lysed in buffer consisting of 25 mM HEPES (pH
7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM EDTA,
1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 1% Nonidet P-40, and
supplemented with a protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche,
Indianapolis, IN) and then centrifuged at 12,000 g at 4°C
for 15 minutes. For co-IP, the protein lysates (1 mg) were
incubated with the JG6 antibodies with rocking for 4 hours
at 4°C, followed by the incubation of protein A/G plus
Agarose (Santa Cruz) for 6 hours to overnight at 4°C with
rocking. The bound proteins were then eluted using 0.2%
sodium dodecyl sulfate.

Preparation of F- and G-actin Extracts
The concentration of F-actin and G-actin in cells
was obtained using an F-actin/G-actin assay kit (catalog
number: BK 037, Cytoskeleton, Denver, CO). Briefly,
cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline at 25
°C and scraped and homogenized in a lysis and F-actin
stabilization buffer (LAS1). F-actin was then separated
from G-actin by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 60 min
at 37 °C. The F-actin-containing pellet was resuspended
in ddH2O containing 2 μm cytochalasin D at a volume
equivalent to the G-actin-containing supernatant volume.
The resuspended F-actin pellet was kept on ice for 60 min
with mixing by pipette every 15 min to dissociate F-actin.
After dissociation, dissociated F-actin was centrifuged
at 14,000 g for 10 min at 4 °C. The F-actin and G-actin
preparations were then assayed for protein.

Immunoblot Analysis
Both total protein lysates and eluted proteins from
the co-IP experiment were separated by sodium dodecyl
sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred
to Hybond C Extra nitrocellulose membranes (GE
Healthcare, Chalfont, St.Giles, UK). Membranes were
incubated in blocking solution containing 5% nonfat dry
milk for 1 hour at room temperature. The membranes
were incubated at 4°C overnight with the appropriate
primary antibodies immunoblotting for GAPDH or β-actin
served as a protein loading control. All experiments were
performed at least three independent times.

Spontaneous Metastasis Assay and Tumor Growth
Inhibition

F-actin depolymerizing/severing activity assay
Mg2+-bound actin (4 μM; 5% pyrene-labelled)
was polymerized for 12 h at 20 °C. Depolymerization
was initiated by a 12-fold dilution in 10 mM Hepes/
KOH/16 mM Tris/HCl/2 mM MgCl2/100 mM KCl/0.5
mM EGTA/0.1 mM dithiothreitol (pH 7.2) containing 2
μM WT or mutant cofilin. The decline in fluorescence was
monitored immediately. JG6 was added when necessary,
depending on certain application.

Female athymic nude mice, ages 4 to 5 weeks, were
anesthetized with chloral hydrate, Hypodermic injection
an inoculum of human breast cancer MDA-MB-435 cells
(5×107) through a 27-gauge needle. The well-developed
tumors were cut into 1-mm3 fragments and transplanted
s.c. into the right flank of nude mice using a trocar. When
the tumor reached a volume of 100 to 200 mm3, mice were
divided into three experimental groups, specifically (a)
untreated ( n = 12); (b) JG6 10 mg/kg (n = 6); and (c) JG6
20 mg/kg (n = 6). JG6 was s.c. administrated through the
tail vein once a day for 6 weeks thereafter. Tumors and
body weight of mice were measured individually twice
per week. Mice were sacrificed 5 days later after the final
therapy. The lungs were removed, some were fixed with
Bouin’s solution, and metastatic nodules were counted.

MTT cytotoxicity assay
Human breast cancer cells were seeded into 96well plates, attached overnight and subsequently exposed
to different concentrations of JG6 for 48 h. Cytotoxicity
to breast cancer cells were assessed by MTT assay as
previously described[11]. The cytotoxicity was measured
as inhibition rate which was calculated as:[1-(A570
treated/A570 control)] × 100%.

Statistics
Student t-test and analysis of variance (ANOVA)
were performed using Statview. P < 0.05 was considered
significant and P < 0.01 as highly significant. Five parallel
samples were prepared in each group and all experiments
