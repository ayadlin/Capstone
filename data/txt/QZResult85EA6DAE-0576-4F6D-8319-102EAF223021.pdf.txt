Abstract
Mutations in the p53 tumor suppressor gene frequently result
in expression of p53 point mutants that accumulate in cancer
cells and actively collaborate with tumor progression through
the acquisition of novel properties. Interfering with mutant
p53 functions may represent a valid alternative for blocking
tumor growth and development of aggressive phenotypes. The
interactions and activities of selected proteins can be
specifically modulated by the binding of peptide aptamers
(PA). In the present work, we isolated PAs able to interact
more efficiently with p53 conformational mutants compared
with wild-type p53. The interaction between mutant p53 and
PAs was further characterized using molecular modeling.
Transient expression of PAs was able to reduce the transactivation activity of mutant p53 and to induce apoptosis
specifically in cells expressing mutant p53. These PAs could
provide a potential strategy to inhibit the oncogenic functions
of mutant p53 and improve mutant p53-targeted cancer
therapies. [Cancer Res 2008;68(16):6550–8]

Introduction
Most tumors are characterized by impairment of the p53
pathway, either by mutations of the p53 gene (TP53; ref. 1), or by
deregulation of other components of this pathway (2). The
importance of p53 function as a tumor suppressor is underlined
by the fact that at least 50% of human tumors carry mutations in
TP53. Interestingly, the majority of the TP53 alterations are
missense mutations leading to the expression of full-length point
mutants that accumulate to high levels in tumor cells (3).
Wild-type p53 is a transcription factor that becomes activated in
response to stress signals and can determine different cellular
outcomes, such as temporary growth arrest and DNA repair,
senescence, or apoptosis (2–4). The p53 protein contains four
functional domains: an NH2-terminal transactivation domain
(TAD), a proline-rich domain, a central DNA-binding core domain
(CD), and a COOH-terminal oligomerization domain (5). Most
frequently, tumor-associated p53 mutations lie in the CD and, as a
consequence, they hamper the ability of the protein to recognize its
responsive elements within target promoters (6). According to the
effect of such mutations on protein structure, the most frequent

p53 mutants (‘‘hotspots’’) are classified either as contact mutants,
where an amino acid (aa) directly involved in protein-DNA
interaction is mutated, or conformational mutants, where mutations alter the overall protein conformation without affecting aas
directly involved in DNA binding (7).
The expression of p53 point mutants was shown to favor
tumorigenesis and this oncogenic function has been explained by
both trans-dominant suppression of wt p53 activities and by the
acquisition of novel properties by mutant proteins, commonly called
gain-of-function (GOF), which may cooperate with tumor development independently of wt p53 inhibition (8). Mutant p53 GOF has
been associated with enhanced tumorigenic potential in mice,
increased proliferation, and resistance to drugs commonly used in
anticancer therapy (9–12). In addition, mouse models have provided
evidence for a role of mutant p53 in altering tumor spectrum and
increasing the metastatic potential of tumors cells (11–14).
Conversely, ablation of mutant p53 expression in human tumor–
derived cell lines reduced proliferation, survival, chemoresistance,
and tumorigenicity (15). The mechanisms underlying mutant p53
GOF remain largely unclear; nevertheless, recent experimental
findings have shown that mutant p53 is involved in precise cellular
events. Mutant p53 was shown to alter the expression of several
genes involved in cell proliferation, most likely by modifying the
activities of other transcription factors (16–19). In addition, p53
mutants form aberrant protein complexes with several proteins such
as p73 (20), p63 (21), and Mre11 (22) interfering with their ability to
induce apoptosis or a proficient DNA damage response respectively.
Given that mutant p53 actively contributes to tumorigenesis and
is highly expressed in tumor cells, it represents an attractive target
for the development of selective anticancer therapies. Indeed, some
approaches aimed at restoring wt function in p53 mutants led to
the identification of small molecules and peptides, which are able
to selectively induce apoptosis in cells expressing mutant p53 (23).
Here, we report the identification and characterization of short
peptide aptamers (PA) able to bind to different p53 mutants,
whereas not to wt p53. PAs consist of a short variable peptide
domain usually expressed in the context of a protein scaffold and
they are selected from high-complexity libraries to specifically
target proteins and modulate their activity (24). The identified PAs
specifically interfere with mutant p53 transcriptional functions and
are able to trigger apoptosis selectively in tumor cells expressing
mutant p53. Moreover, by molecular modeling based on the
available structural information, we defined a region on mutant
p53 that is predicted to be recognized by PAs.

(pLexAp53R175H74-298, pLexAp53R175H74-393, and pLexAp5374-393). The
high complexity peptide library (pJG4-5-HA-TNV16mers) was constructed
in the pJG4-5-HA vector by cloning a mixture of degenerated oligonucleotides into the RsrII site, present in the sequence of the catalytic region of
Escherichia coli Thioredoxin (TrxA). Oligos contained 16 repetitions of the
codon NNG/T (N, any nucleotide) flanked by two regions with defined
sequences including the site for AvaII, compatible with RsrII. This construct
mediates the expression of the preys, inserted in the TrxA scaffold, fused to
the B42 TAD of E. coli, and under the control of the inducible promoter
Gal1. The S.cerevisiae strain EGY48 (MATa trp1 ura3 his3 LEU2::pLEXAop6LEU2), transformed with the plasmid pSH18-34, containing the
reporter gene LacZ, was used. For the primary screening, the strain
EGY48/pSH18-34 was transformed initially with the bait pLexAp53R175H74298 and then with the library pJG4-5-HA-TNV16mers. The yeast two-hybrid
screening was performed as previously described (24). About 9 million of
clones were screened in selective medium lacking Histine, Uracil,
Tryptophan, Leucine, and containing 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-h-D-galactopyranoside (X-Gal) as previously described (24).
Peptides. Peptides corresponding to the sequences of A3, A29, A79, sA79,
B6, and C-(SFDTDVLKADGAILVD) were automatically synthetized on solid
phase (Fmoc/t-Bu chemistry) at ICGEB as described in Supplementary
Data. Peptide A60 was not synthesized due to technical problems.
Cell culture, transfections, and luciferase assays. H1299, U2OS, Sk-Br3, HCT116, MG63, HT-29, and MDA-MB-468 cells were cultured as described
(25). Transfections of all cell lines were performed with Lipofectamine 2000
(Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. For luciferase
assays, MG63 were seeded in 24-wells plates and transfected with 600 ng of
c-MycD1Luc reporter, 250 ng of p53D281G expression plasmid, 20 ng of the

reporter pRL-CMV (Promega), together with 500 ng of pLPC-EGFP-TNV-PAs
or pLPC-EGFP-TNV or pLPC-EGFP. Luciferase assays in the presence of
FsA79 were performed in H1299 cells seeded in 24-well plates and
transfected with 250 ng of EGR1Luc reporter, 600 ng of p53R175H or
p53R273H expression plasmids, and 20 ng of the reporter pRL-CMV
(Promega). FsA79 (at final concentrations of 1.6, 4, and 20 Amol/L) was
added in the cDNA premix before incubation with Lipofectamine 2000.
More than 90% of cells were positive to FsA79 staining (Supplementary
Fig. S1B). Thirty-six hours after transfection, cells were lysed and assayed
for luciferase activity using the Dual Luciferase kit (Promega). P values were
obtained from two-tailed homoscedastic t tests. For RNAi, cells were
transfected with 80 nmol/L double-stranded siRNA oligonucleotide for
human p53 (GACUCCAGUGGUAAUCUAC) or for LacZ (GUGACCAGCGAAUACCUGGU) using Lipofectamine RNAi MAX (Invitrogen).
Coimmunoprecipitation, in vitro binding assays, and Western blot
analysis. Coimmunoprecipitation (Co-IP) and in vitro binding assays were
performed as described in Supplementary Data and as previously described
(26). Western Blot analysis was performed using affinity purified polyclonal
anti–green fluorescent protein (GFP); monoclonal anti-p53 antibody (clone:
DO1; S.Cruz Biotechnology), monoclonal anti-HA (SIGMA), monoclonal
anti–vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV; SIGMA), anti-PARP p85 polyclonal
antibody (Promega), anti-Bax polyclonal antibody (Cell Signaling), and antiactin polyclonal antibody (SIGMA).
Modeling and docking analysis. The structure of mutant p53 R273H
was built from the crystal structure (PDB entry: 2BIM; ref. 27) after
reversing all the stabilizing mutations that were necessary for crystallization
(M133L, V293A, N239Y, and N268D) by means of the Swiss-PDB Viewer
program (28). Aptamers were first modeled as loops inserted inside TrxA

each peptide were chosen as representative of the peptide structure.
Peptides underwent to blind docking against mutant p53 by using the
AutoDock 3.0.5 program (31) considering the protein static. Ligand-only
side chains were considered flexible, as partial backbone conformational
variability is considered by docking the five most representative structures
of each peptide. Eventually, 1,250 different complexes of each peptide were
produced. A more detailed description of the modeling and the docking
procedure is available in the Supplementary Data.
Fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis. Sk-Br-3, MDA-MB-468,

supernatants, and resuspended in PBS/0.1% NP40/2 Ag/mL RNaseA. After
10 min of incubation, 10 Ag/mL propidium iodide was added. Cells were
analyzed by cytofluorimeter (FACScalibur) after additional 20 min. At least
104 enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-positive cells were analyzed
in each acquisition. For Annexin-V binding analysis, 36 h after transfection,
2  105 cells were collected and washed as described above, resuspended in
500 AL of 1 Binding Buffer (#1035-100; BioVision), and 1 AL AnnexinV-PECyan5 reagent (#1015-200; BioVision) was added. After 5 min of incubation,
cells were analyzed for AnnexinV-PE-Cy5 binding by flow cytometer. In
every fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis, P values were
obtained from one-tailed homoscedastic t tests. Etoposide was from
SIGMA. PRIMA-1 was kindly provided by Klas Wiman (Karolinska Institut,
Stockholm, Sweden).

Results
Isolation of PAs interacting with mutant p53. To identify
PAs that specifically recognize and bind mutant p53, a modified
yeast two-hybrid screening was performed using as a bait the CD
(aas 74–298) of p53R175H mutant (Fig. 1A). A library of random
PAs was generated as a prey, by inserting degenerated oligonucleotides encoding 16 aa peptides, into the catalytic site of E. coli TrxA
A, used as scaffold (see Materials and Methods). The library
construct (pJG4-5-HA-TNV16mers) contains an expression cassette
named TNV, where the Trx cDNA is fused with an NH2-terminal HA

tag and with a COOH-terminal nuclear localization sequence from
SV40 virus large T-antigen (NLS) and a VSV tag (Fig. 1B; ref. 26).
About 9 million clones were screened (32), and after two rounds of
screening, 53 PAs were identified as interactors of p53R175H CD.
These interactions were also confirmed in a tertiary screening, by
using aas 74 to 393 of either p53R175H or wt p53 as baits. Ten
aptamers were able to bind mutant p53R175H, but not wt p53, and
were therefore chosen for further study. Sequence analysis revealed
that most aptamers are rich in hydrophobic residues, even if their
primary sequences do not show significant homology (Fig. 1C).
To confirm the interaction of the selected PAs with mutant p53 in
mammalian cells, we generated constructs encoding the TNV
cassette containing the selected aptamers fused to EGFP into
pLPC expression vector (Fig. 1B). Experiments were performed by
transiently overexpressing p53R175H and PAs in p53-null
H1299 cells, in which they efficiently colocalize in the nucleus
(Supplementary Fig. S1A). Co-IP experiments revealed that all PAs
tested were able to bind to mutant p53 with the exception of B6
(Fig. 1D). Aptamers A3, A29, A60, and A79 showed the strongest
interaction with p53R175H, and were therefore chosen for further
characterization, whereas aptamer B6 was used as a negative control.
Aptamers may lose their ability to bind the target protein when
tested as unconstrained molecules, free from the protein scaffold
(33). To evaluate whether unconstrained PAs retain the ability to
bind mutant p53, biotinylated 16mers were produced for in vitro
binding experiments with cellular lysates of Sk-Br-3, expressing
endogenous p53R175H (Supplementary Fig. S2A). Some of the tested
peptides, but not a control peptide derived from the TrxA sequence
(C ), retained the ability to bind to mutant p53. Due to technical
problems in the chemical synthesis, we redesigned the A79 peptide,
changing the position of some residues in its primary sequence
(Fig. 1C). The modified biotinylated A79, called sA79, binds
efficiently mutant p53 in vitro (Supplementary Fig. S2A). The interaction between sA79 inserted in the TrxA scaffold and mutant p53
was also confirmed by Co-IP experiments (Supplementary Fig. S2B).

Peptide Aptamers as Modulators of Mutant p53 Function

Selective binding of PAs to mutant p53. In our screening, we
searched for aptamers able to bind specifically the CD of p53R175H
because this domain is expected to be structurally distorted and
consequently dissimilar to that of wt p53. Therefore, we examined
whether the selected PAs could discriminate between the altered
conformation of mutant p53 and the native conformation of wt
p53. HA-tagged versions of p53R175H and wt p53 were generated
and coexpressed along with EGFP-tagged aptamers in H1299 cells.
Co-IP experiments indicated that all aptamers bind stronger to
p53R175H than to wt p53 (Fig. 2A). Similar results were obtained
also upon overexpression of PAs in HCT116 cells, harboring
endogenous wt p53, or in Sk-Br-3 cells (Supplementary Fig. S2C).
Moreover, we examined whether the PAs could recognize the p53
homologues, p73 and p63 (34), in similar Co-IP experiments.
Interestingly, all selected PAs bind efficiently also HA-TAp73a
(Fig. 2A) and to a lesser extent HA-TAp63a (data not shown). Taken
together, these results show that the identified aptamers recognize
more efficiently p53R175H and TAp73a than wt p53.
Finally, we tested whether PAs could also interact with other p53
mutants by performing Co-IPs with another conformational
mutant (p53D281G) or with two contact mutants (p53R273H and
p53R248W; Fig. 2B; Supplementary Fig. S2D). Noteworthy, when we
compared the interaction of PAs with this set of proteins, we
observed that they preferentially bind conformational mutants
comparing with contact mutants or the wt protein (Fig. 2B). These
results suggest that the selected aptamers may recognize more
efficiently conformational unfolded p53 mutants.

Docking of PAs on mutant p53 R273H. Taking advantage of
the restricted degrees of freedom of the PAs conformation when
inserted in the TrxA scaffold, we modeled the conformation of PAs
through in silico analysis. Despite the lack of significant homology
among their sequences, the backbones of PAs seemed to share a
fairly similar extended conformation in their NH2-terminal part
(Fig. 3A).
For the docking of PAs onto mutant p53, we used the X-ray
structure of superstable p53R273H, which contains four stabilizing
mutations (M133L, V203A, N239Y, and N268D; PDB CODE: 2BIM;
ref. 35). At present, this is the only crystal structure available for
mutant p53. Indeed, despite the good knowledge of the structure of
the wt p53 CD, there are only few structural information about the
core domains of p53 mutants, due to their high thermodynamic
instability (36). In our docking analysis, all the stabilizing
mutations have been reversed using Swiss-Pdb Viewer program
(see Materials and Methods).
Two regions of p53R273H were predicted to be important for
docking of all the PAs considered (Table 1; Fig. 3B and C). They
involve the N-terminus of CD and the loop-sheet-helix (LSH) motif,
which establish a large number of polar interactions with the
aptamers, particularly T102, L130, and N131 that interact with four
of five PAs (Fig. 3B). Other residues predicted to be contacted by
some aptamers comprise L111-H115 (L1), Y126-K132 (S2/S2’), and
K164-H273 (L2-H1). A29 and sA79 also form extensive hydrophobic
interactions with Leu111, Phe113, Tyr126, Pro128 and Thr102,
Tyr103, respectively.

NOTE: In the first column are the residues of p53R273H contacted by some PAs. In all the other columns, are the residues of every aptamer that contacts
residues of p53R273H. Residues of p53R273H are reported in a three-letter code, residues of the aptamers are reported in a one-letter code, and bold
lettering represents the aptamer residues more important for the binding to mutant p53. Numbers represent the aa position in the p53 protein or in the
aptamers sequences. Residues of p53 marked with asterisks are those contacted by at least 3 of 5 aptamers. Residues that establish interactions are as
follows: hydrophobic (h) or polar (b, s, and t). Part of the residues that establish the H-bond interactions are as follows: (b) backbone, (s) side chain,
(t) NH2 or COOH terminal.

PAs interfere with mutant p53 transactivating functions.
One of the mechanisms proposed to explain the oncogenic activity
of mutant p53 is its ability to alter the transcription of several
genes. In particular, p53D281G was reported to induce the c-Myc
promoter (37). To test whether PAs might inhibit this activity of
mutant p53, luciferase assays using a c-Myc reporter were
performed after overexpression of p53D281G in p53-null MG63
cells. All aptamers were able to significantly impair the
transactivation activity of mutant p53, whereas B6 failed to show
any effect (Fig. 4A). Furthermore, we also tested whether
unconstrained synthetic peptides could behave similarly because
they are able to interact with p53 mutants such as R175H and
R273H (Supplementary Fig. S2A; data not shown). Fluoresceinated
sA79 peptide (FsA79) was synthesized and used in reporter assays
to test its effect on the induction of EGR-1, known to be another
target of mutant p53 transactivation (19). Luciferase assays were
performed by treating H1299 cells with FsA79 upon cotransfection
of an EGR1 reporter along with either p53R175H or p53R273H
expression constructs. The results indicated that FsA79 is able to
inhibit the transactivation function of both p53 mutants (Fig. 4B).
As shown above, all PAs recognized wt p53 less efficiently
(Fig. 2). To test if PAs may also affect the transcriptional activity of wt
p53, H1299 cells were transfected with a reporter bearing the p21
promoter (p21-Luc) along with vectors expressing wt p53 and PAs.
Under these conditions, none of the PAs was able to affect the
transcriptional activity of wt p53 (Fig. 4C). Interestingly, similar

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (16). August 15, 2008

results were obtained when we have analyzed the effect of PAs on the
transactivation of p21-Luc by TAp73a (Fig. 4D), with the exception
of A3, which showed a slight reduction of TAp73a activity. Moreover,
when assayed on a reporter construct bearing the Bax promoter
(Bax-Luc), PAs did not significantly affect the transactivation of
either wt p53 or TAp73a, with the exception of A60 (Supplementary
Fig. S3). Taken together, these results indicate that PAs, able to
specifically bind mutant p53, interfere with its transactivation ability
but do not alter the activity of either wt p53 or TAp73a.
PAs trigger apoptosis specifically in cells bearing mutant
p53. Because the expression of mutant p53 in tumor cells has been
associated with increased cell proliferation and survival (38, 39), we
sought to analyze the effect of PAs on cell cycle and apoptosis
of two cancer cell lines (Sk-Br-3 and MDA-MB-468) bearing
endogenous mutant p53 (respectively, p53R175H and p53R273H).
To selectively analyze cells expressing the PAs, propidium-iodide
staining was measured only in the EGFP-positive cell population.
FACS analysis of EGFP-positive cells revealed an increment in the
sub-G1 population, indicative of apoptotic cell death, only in cells
expressing PAs able to bind mutant p53 (Fig. 5A), whereas no
relevant changes were observed in other cell cycle variables
(Supplementary Fig. S4A and B). On the other hand, no effect was
observed in cells transfected with B6, which is unable to bind
mutant p53. Furthermore, PAs did not seem to induce apoptosis of
either p53-null H1299 cells or U2OS cells, expressing endogenous
wt p53 (Fig. 5A). Noteworthy, upon ablation of endogenous mutant

p53 in MDA-MB-468 cells by using specific siRNA, we observed that
the effect of the two more effective PAs, A29 and sA79, was
significantly reduced (Fig. 5B). To further support the observation
that PAs induce cell death specifically in cells expressing mutant
p53, we generated polyclonal H1299 cell populations stably
expressing p53R175H. PAs induced apoptosis in these cells,
whereas no effect was observed in control cells transfected with
the empty vector (Supplementary Fig. S4C). All these data suggest
that the effect of PAs depends on the presence of mutant p53.
The ability to induce apoptosis displayed by the most effective
PAs (A29 and sA79) was confirmed by Annexin-V assays in
EGFP-positive cells. Flow cytometry analysis showed an increase
of f2-fold in the percentage of Annexin-V–positive cells
upon transfection with the selected PAs, compared with controltransfected cells (Fig. 5C; Supplementary Fig. S4D and E). Finally,
an increase of the cleaved p85 fragment of PARP-1 in Sk-Br-3

cells transfected with A29 or sA79, further confirmed the ability of
these aptamers to induce apoptosis (Fig. 5C).
We next compared the apoptotic activity of PAs to the effect of
commonly used anticancer drugs and also evaluated their possible
cooperation. Sk-Br-3 cells were transfected with A29, sA79, or B6
aptamers, treated with two different doses of Etoposide or left
untreated and then assayed for the sub-G1 DNA content as above.
Interestingly, we observed that expression of the PAs interacting
with mutant p53 was sufficient to induce an apoptotic response
comparable with that observed upon drug treatment alone
(Fig. 5D). No further increment of cell death was however
evidenced when cells transfected with PAs were simultaneously
exposed to Etoposide (Fig. 5D, gray and white bars).
Moreover, we compared PAs with other molecules previously
reported to induce cell death in cells bearing mutant p53, such as
peptide 46 and PRIMA-1 (40). First, Sk-Br-3 cells were transfected

Figure 5. PAs trigger apoptosis specifically in cells bearing mutant p53. A, the apoptotic effect of PAs was analyzed in U2OS (expressing p53 wt), H1299
(p53-null), Sk-Br-3 (expressing p53R175H), and MDA-MB-468 (expressing p53R273H) cells. Cells were transfected either with constructs expressing EGFP-TNV-PAs
or pLPC control vector, harvested after 36 h, and stained with propidium iodide before analyzing the DNA content of EGFP-positive cells by flow cytometry.
Columns, mean percentage of cells with sub-G1 DNA content measured in three independent experiments; bars, SD. The P values of individual PAs
compared with negative controls (aptamer B6 or pLPC vector) were <0.01 in each cell line analyzed. B, analysis of the apoptotic effect of PAs in MDA-MB-468
cells treated with control siRNA (LacZ ; black bars ) or siRNA for p53 (white bars ). Cells were treated and analyzed as in A . Expression of the overexpressed
EGFP-TNV-PAs, as well as endogenous p53R273H and actin, was analyzed by Western Blot with the indicated antibodies. The P values of individual PAs
compared with negative controls (aptamer B6 or pLPC vector) were <0.01. C, analysis of AnnexinV-PE-Cyan5 staining of Sk-Br-3 cells transfected with constructs
encoding either EGFP-TNV-B6, EGFP-TNV-A29, or EGFP-TNV-sA79 PAs or with pLPC control vector. At least 104 EGFP-positive cells were analyzed in each
acquisition. Columns, mean of three independent experiments; bars, SD. The P values of A29 and sA79 relative to B6 were <0.01. Expression of the overexpressed
EGFP-TNV-PAs as well as endogenous cleaved PARP (p85), p53R175H, and the proapoptotic protein Bax was analyzed by Western Blot with the indicated
antibodies. D, Sk-Br-3 cells were transfected with constructs encoding EGFP-TNV-A29 and sA79 PAs and then treated either with Etoposide 10 Amol/L (gray bars ),
50 Amol/L (white bars ), or with DMSO as control (NT ; black bars). FACS analysis of DNA content was then performed as in A. Aliquots of cell lysates untreated

with the PAs A29 or sA79 or a pLPC-EGFP-TNV construct
containing the sequence encoding the peptide 46 and analyzed
as above. Propidium iodide staining showed that PAs and peptide
46 produce a similar induction of apoptosis (Supplementary
Fig. S4F). Second, Sk-Br-3 cells transfected with aptamer B6, unable
to induce apoptosis, and treated with 100 Amol/L PRIMA-1 for
20 hours were compared with cells transfected with A29 or sA79.
Also in this case, the percentage of apoptosis in cells expressing PAs
was comparable with that induced by PRIMA-1 (Supplementary
Fig. S4G). These data therefore suggest that PAs can induce
apoptosis specifically in cells expressing mutant p53 to a level
comparable with chemotherapeutic drugs, peptide 46, and PRIMA-1.

Discussion
Mutation of the p53 gene is one of the most frequent alterations
found in human cancers (3). The vast majority consists of missense

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (16). August 15, 2008

mutations leading to the expression of p53 point mutants, which
accumulate to high levels in tumor cells. The presence of these
mutant proteins actively contributes to tumorigenesis, either by
inhibiting wt p53 activity or by gaining new functions, which may
concur to the development of an invasive and metastatic
phenotype (reviewed in refs. 7, 38). Consequently, mutant p53
may be regarded as an excellent target for therapeutic approaches
aimed at hampering tumor progression. Ablation of mutant p53
expression was indeed shown to reduce proliferation, chemoresistance, and tumorigenicity in several tumor-derived cell
lines (15). Moreover, mutant p53-based cancer therapies are
expected to be highly selective, leaving unaffected normal cells,
which express wt p53.
In the present work, we have identified five PAs able to interact
with p53 point mutants. All of them interact preferentially with p53
conformational mutants (R175H, D281G) comparing with contact

Peptide Aptamers as Modulators of Mutant p53 Function

mutants (R273H, R248W). Moreover, they also bind less efficiently
to wt p53, suggesting that the altered conformation of unfolded p53
mutants enhances the interaction.
Docking analysis performed on the available crystal structure of
p53R273H, with all the stabilizing mutations reversed to the
original residues (36), predicted that all PAs would bind the same
region of the mutant p53 CD. Notably, this area partially overlaps
with a region that in wt p53 was previously defined as a promiscuous
site, involved in the interactions with DNA and proteins, such as
Rad51, 53BP2, 53BP1, and Bcl-XL (41).
Interestingly, PAs that interact with mutant p53 are also able
to bind efficiently TAp73a. This may be due to the presence of a
structural element in TAp73a similar to that recognized by PAs in
mutant p53. A more detailed structural analysis would be necessary
to address this point. Despite their ability to bind TAp73a, PAs did
not significantly affect its transcriptional activity toward p21 and
Bax promoters, suggesting that they may not perturb the
interaction of TAp73a with DNA or other cofactors. Conversely,
PAs seem to interfere specifically with the transactivating functions
of p53 mutants. The oncogenic activity of mutant p53 was associated to its ability to induce transcription of several target genes (42).
Even if p53 mutants are unable, or have a reduced ability, to bind wt
p53 responsive elements on DNA, they are able to modify gene
expression by establishing aberrant complexes with transcription
factors (16, 17). According to our results, PAs interfere with the
transactivation of c-Myc and EGR-1 promoters by p53 mutants,
suggesting that they might act by affecting protein-protein interactions that are relevant for transcriptional activation of these genes.
In addition, we have observed a specific ability of PAs to induce
cell death in different cell lines expressing mutant p53, whereas the
same PAs failed to produce any effect in cells bearing wt p53 or in
p53-null cells. Moreover, ablation of endogenous mutant p53
reduced PA-induced cell death, further suggesting that the
induction of apoptosis depends on the presence of mutant p53.
The ability of peptides or small molecules, such as PRIMA-1, to
induce mutant p53–dependent apoptosis was reported previously
(reviewed in ref. 23). In some cases, cell death was associated with
restoration of wt functions in mutant p53 proteins, including the
ability to bind p53 responsive elements on DNA and to transactivate
some of the target genes of wt p53. Of note, the apoptotic response
induced by PAs was comparable with that exerted by PRIMA-1.
However, the PAs described here seem to behave differently from
molecules that reactivate wt p53 functions. In fact, upon binding to
mutant p53, PAs were neither able to restore its ability to bind DNA,
as judged by EMSA assays, nor to induce wt p53 target genes, such
as p21 and Bax (Figs. 4C and 5C; data not shown).
Even if the exact mechanism by which the PAs induce cell death
still remains to be determined, it is well-conceivable that PAinduced apoptosis may arise from the activation of alternative types
of programmed cell death. Indeed, it was recently reported that a

peptide derived from the p53 C-terminus (peptide 46) could induce
apoptosis in different tumor cells expressing mutant p53 (40, 43, 44),
which was associated with increased PARP-1 cleavage, but not with
significant changes in the expression of Bcl-2 family members (40),
similar to what we observed in cancer cells expressing PAs.
Ablation of mutant p53 was shown to enhance the induction of
cell death upon treatment with genotoxic drugs; however, it is not
sufficient to induce apoptosis in the absence of drug treatment
(15). Instead, expression of PAs alone, in cells bearing mutant p53,
exerted an apoptotic response similar to that induced by Etoposide, and no further increment was observed by concomitant
administration of the drug and PAs to cells (Fig. 5D).
These results suggest that the association of PAs with mutant
p53 may have a cytotoxic effect. Aberrant interactions of mutant
p53 with different proteins was proposed to contribute to its
oncogenic functions (38). Among them, transcription cofactors
could be deregulated upon interaction with mutant p53 (16) or
proapoptotic proteins, such as p73 and p63, could be sequestered
by mutant p53 (20, 21). Therefore, the cytotoxic effect of PAs, could
derive from their ability to perturb the profile of mutant p53
interactors, either by altering mutant p53 structure or by directly
displacing other interactors, which may share with PAs some
structural features relevant for their interactions with mutant p53.
In this way, proapoptotic factors could be released and activated. A
more detailed characterization of these similarities could be useful
to identify new mutant p53 interactors.
In summary, our work shows that PAs able to interact with p53
point mutants, interfere with its functions and induce apoptosis in
tumor-derived cell lines bearing mutant p53. Based on their
characteristics, PAs may be exploited to specifically target tumor
cells expressing p53 mutants and therefore they may represent a
starting point to design efficient peptido-mimetic drugs.
