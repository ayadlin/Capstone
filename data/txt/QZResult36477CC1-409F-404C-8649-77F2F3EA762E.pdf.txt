ABSTRACT
Introduction: KRAS oncogene mutations (MUTKRAS) drive resistance to EGFR
inhibition by providing alternative signaling as demonstrated in colo-rectal cancer. In
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the efficacy of treatment with EGFR tyrosine kinase
inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) depends on activating EGFR mutations (MUTEGFR). However,
inhibition of EGFR may select resistant cells displaying alternative signaling, i.e.,
KRAS, or restoration of EGFR activity due to additional MUTEGFR, i.e., the c.2369C > T
(p.T790MEGFR).
Aim: The aim of this study was to investigate the appearance of MUTKRAS during
EGFR-TKI treatment and their contribution to drug resistance.
Methods: This study used cell-free circulating tumor DNA (cftDNA) to evaluate
the appearance of codon 12 MUTKRAS and p.T790MEGFR mutations in 33 advanced NSCLC
patients progressing after an EGFR-TKI.
Results: p.T790MEGFR was detected in 11 (33.3%) patients, MUTKRAS at codon 12
in 3 (9.1%) while both p.T790MEGFR and MUTKRAS codon 12 were found in 13 (39.4%)
patients. Six patients (18.2%) were KRAS wild-type (WTKRAS) and negative for
p.T790M
EGFR. In 8 subjects paired tumor re-biopsy/plasma samples were available;
the percent concordance of tissue/plasma was 62.5% for p.T790MEGFR and 37.5% for
MUT
KRAS. The analysis of time to progression (TTP) and overall survival (OS) in WTKRAS
vs. MUTKRAS were not statistically different, even if there was a better survival with
WT
KRAS vs. MUTKRAS, i.e., TTP 14.4 vs. 11.4 months (p = 0.97) and OS 40.2 vs. 35.0
months (p = 0.56), respectively.

Conclusions: MUTKRAS could be an additional mechanism of escape from EGFR-TKI
inhibition and cftDNA is a feasible approach to monitor the molecular development
of drug resistance.

INTRODUCTION

This finding reveals a potential new mechanism of
resistance to EGFR-TKI and underscores the need of
a periodic monitoring of somatic mutations of known
oncogenes to deliver the best personalized treatment in a
timely fashion.

Activating mutations of epidermal growth factor
receptor (MUTEGFR) predict sensitivity to tyrosine kinase
inhibitors (TKI) in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
Despite a very high response rate (about 70%) to firstline treatment with the EGFR-TKIs (erlotinib, gefitinib or
afatinib) in MUTEGFR NSCLC, tumors invariably progress
after a median of 9–13 months from the beginning of
treatment [1–3].
The understanding of the molecular basis of acquired
resistance to TKI [4] and its application to treatment
monitoring may improve treatment management by
discontinuing ineffective treatments and directing
towards most appropriate second line options before
clinical progression may occur. Indeed, EGFR signaling is
maintained in most cases that develop secondary resistance
[5] suggesting that additional molecular mechanisms can
bypass EGFR-TKI inhibition reactivating the signaling
pathway. Several mechanisms of acquired resistance
to EGFR-TKI have been described after progression,
including c.2369C > T (p.T790M) EGFR gatekeeper
mutation (p.T790MEGFR, ~50% of patients) [6], MET
(5–15%) [7] or HER2 (12%) [8] amplifications, PIK3CA
(4.1%) [9] or BRAF (1%) [10] mutations or transformation
into small cell histology (3%) [11].
NSCLC heterogeneity can drive the therapeutic
decisions [12]; therefore, tissue availability is increasingly
recognized as a crucial issue. Unfortunately, the location
of the tumor and the risk of complications are serious
limitations to re-biopsies in NSCLC [13]. Alternatively,
the detection of somatic mutations in cell-free tumor DNA
(cftDNA) released in plasma could be instrumental for a
better understanding of the genetic modifications driven
by the selective pressure of drug treatments [14].
Interestingly, approximately 15–25% of patients
with NSCLC have KRAS mutations (MUTKRAS), resulting
in constitutive activation of KRAS signaling pathways.
MUT
KRAS is a negative predictor of benefit to anti-EGFR
antibodies in colo-rectal cancer, while it seems to be a
negative predictor of response to EGFR-TKIs in EGFR
wild type (WTEGFR) NSCLC patients [15]. In a previous
study on a large collection of NSCLC tissues from patients
with acquired resistance to EGFR-TKI, NRAS or KRAS
mutations were not demonstrated [10]. Despite these
negative results, we employed a sensitive ddPCR-based
platform to investigate the presence of MUTKRAS alleles
in plasma of patients resistant to EGFR-TKIs and we
were able to demonstrate a potential role of MUTKRAS in
acquired resistance to EGFR-TKI, besides the p.T790MEGFR.

RESULTS
The clinical characteristics of patients are reported
in Table 1. Of 33 patients, 20 (60.6%) were female and 13
(39.4%) male. Median age was 62 years (range 41 – 75);
32 patients were affected by a stage IV disease, while one
was a stage IIIB NSCLC. The frequency of activating
MUT
EGFR was as follows: 20 patients (60.6%) showed
ex19del
EGFR, 10 patients (30.3%) p.L858REGFR, 2 patients
(6.1%) p.L747PEGFR and 1 patient presented ex19insEGFR
(3%). As expected, the majority of them (66.7%) was
never-smokers, while 9 (27.2%) and 2 (6.1%) patients
were former- and current-smokers, respectively. Twentyseven (81.8%) subjects received gefitinib and 6 (18.2%)
erlotinib; the treatment was administered as first-line in
23 (69.7%) (including 2 as maintenance), second-line in
6 (18.2%) and third or further lines in 4 patients (12.1%).
The majority of them (66.7%) presented partial response
to TKI treatment and only 1 patient showed complete
response (Table 1). Stable and progressive diseases were
observed in 4 (12.1%) and 6 subjects (18.2%), respectively.
Patients who have progressed on EGFR-TKI treatment,
all receiving gefitinib, presented the following molecular
profile in their primary tumors: p.L747PEGFR and ex19delEGFR
(n = 1 each) and p.L858REGFR (n = 4). Median time to
progression (TTP) was 13.6 months (95% Confidence
Interval, CI, range 8.0 – 19.2 months) and median overall
survival (OS) was 40.2 months (95% CI range 25.8–54.7
months) for the overall population.
The description of patients with activating MUTEGFR
in their primary tumors as well as the percentages of
p.T790M
EGFR and MUTKRAS alleles in cftDNA at the time
of EGFR-TKI progression is reported in Table 2. In 16
patients (48.5%), a codon 12 MUTKRAS was detected in
cftDNA (Figure 1). In addition to this, the p.T790MEGFR
(c.2369C > T) second site mutation was present in the
cftDNA of 24 patients (72.7%). Interestingly, 13 patients
(39.4%) had both the MUTKRAS and p.T790MEGFR, while 3
(9.1%) and 11 (33.3%) subjects displayed only MUTKRAS
or p.T790MEGFR, respectively (Figure 1). Six subjects
displayed no mutations.
The association between smoking habit and the
occurrence of MUTKRAS in cftDNA was investigated.
Regarding the 11 patients with smoking history, 2 (18.2%)

presented MUTKRAS and 9 (81.8%) were wild-type
(WTKRAS). On the contrary, of 22 non-smoking subjects,
14 (63.3%) were MUTKRAS and 8 (36.4%) WTKRAS.
Fisher’s extact test revealed that non-smoking habit and
MUT
KRAS were significantly associated (p = 0.026).
In 8 patients, paired re-biopsies and cftDNA were
available. The 8 re-biopsies were performed in a different
tumor site with respect to the initial diagnosis, the choice
being dependent on several factors, i.e., anatomical
accessibility, new or progressing lesions. The analysis of
re-biopsies by standard methods and ddPCR demonstrated
p.T790M
EGFR in 4 (standard) vs. 2 (ddPCR) samples and
MUT
KRAS in none (standard) vs. 3 (ddPCR) specimens.
p.T790M
EGFR and MUTKRAS were detected in 7 and 5
cftDNA specimens, respectively.
The analysis of KRAS status by ddPCR in the
biopsies at diagnosis revealed the presence of MUTKRAS
in 2 patients, who were WTKRAS by standard method.
Therefore, the percentage of patients developing
MUT
KRAS as a mechanism of acquired resistance is 42%
(14 patients). In terms of TTP and OS, there was no

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

difference between these patients and the others (p = 0.19 and
p = 0.13, respectively).
The concordance between tissue of re-biopsies
(standard methods) and plasma (ddPCR), calculated by
combining positive and negative results, was 62.5% and
37.5% for p.T790MEGFR and MUTKRAS, respectively (Table 3).
Moreover, three paired samples found positive for the
p.T790M
EGFR on re-biopsies (standard methods) and on
cftDNA (ddPCR), were negative by ddPCR on primary
tissue (Table 3).
The analysis of survival data stratified according to
KRAS status in cftDNA, showed that TTP and OS were
not statistically different, despite a trend towards a better
survival in WTKRAS vs. MUTKRAS patients, i.e., TTP 14.4
vs. 11.4 months (p = 0.97) and OS 40.2 vs. 35.0 months
(p = 0.56), respectively.
Finally, samples were analysed also for codons
13 (p.G13D) and 61 MUTKRAS and MUTNRAS, and
V600E
BRAF and all the samples were found to be wild-type.
Unfortunately, due to sample restriction, cftDNA was
insufficient to perform the analysis of PI3K/Akt mutations.

of tumors progressing under EGFR-TKI treatment [4, 11]
and in the cftDNA at a frequency similar to our study
[18–0]. Because drugs active on p.T790MEGFR, such as
AZD9291 and rociletinib [21, 22], are under clinical
study and will be available soon in the clinical practice,
the identification of this molecular marker is of utmost
clinical relevance.
In our study, p.T790MEGFR was more frequent in
L858R

The present study demonstrates the presence of
KRAS in the cftDNA of a significant proportion of
patients progressing after EGFR-TKI treatment. In
addition to this, the present study provides evidence that
sensitizing MUTEGFR and MUTKRAS can coexist after the
selective pressure of EGFR-TKI treatment.

EGFR. To our knowledge, a mechanism of resistance
depending on activating MUTEGFR has not been previously
reported; however, this cohort is too small to draw any
conclusion.
MUT
EGFR and MUTKRAS are mutually exclusive
in primary NSCLC and only anecdotal case reports
described their coexistence [23, 24]. MUTKRAS occurs in
approximately 20% of NSCLC cases at diagnosis, more
frequently in Caucasian population, adenocarcinomas,
males and current smokers [25, 26]. About 90% of KRAS
mutations occur in exon 2 (codon 12 and 13), while
exon 3 (codon 61) is less frequently involved [26, 27];
in never-smokers with lung adenocarcinoma, MUTKRAS
is more frequently a transition (G to A) compared to
transversion in current smokers [25]. Colo-rectal cancer
cells with MUTKRAS treated with anti-EGFR monoclonal
antibodies are able to escape growth inhibition by
several mechanisms, including MUTRAS [28]. While the
role of MUTKRAS in primary resistance to EGFR-TKIs in
molecularly unselected NSCLC is quite well established
[29, 30], its development and role in acquired resistance
to EGFR-TKIs in MUTEGFR patients has not been explored
in detail. In a previous work on a large collection of
NSCLC tissues from patients with acquired EGFR-TKI
resistance, MUTNRAS or MUTKRAS were not demonstrated
[10]. However, comparison with the present results
is not possible because detailed information were not
provided neither on the timing of sampling with respect
of development of TKI resistance nor on the type of
tissue analysed. Therefore, we addressed this issue and
a sensitive ddPCR-based platform was employed to
investigate the presence of MUTKRAS alleles besides the
well-known p.T790MEGFR. Due to its high sensitivity,

ddPCR is able to identify small amounts of MUTKRAS
and many methodological issues need to be addressed
prospectically, particularly the threshold level of both
MUT
KRAS and p.T790MEGFR to be considered clinically
relevant. However, a mechanism of drug resistance
does not necessarily reflect biologic aggressiveness and
the lack of difference in OS between KRAS wild-type
and mutated patients it is therefore not surprising. The
numeric dimension of the cell clone bearing MUTKRAS
should be taken into consideration as well. Nevertheless,
despite the low proportion of smokers in our cohort, the
high prevalence of MUTKRAS could support its role of as
mechanism of acquired resistance.
Eight patients underwent re-biopsy after tumor
progression during EGFR-TKI, allowing a comparison
between tissue and cftDNA. The detection of mutations in
cftDNA but not in re-biopsy, using both standard methods
and ddPCR, could suggest the presence of heterogeneity
within metastatic sites or the lower performance of ddPCR
in the presence of paraffin. Nevertheless, the detection of
mutations in both plasma and tissue by ddPCR, but not by
standard methods, could be due to the higher sensitivity of
ddPCR analysis. Two patients, initially diagnosed WTKRAS
by standard method, were re-analysed by ddPCR and were
found MUTKRAS in the primary biopsy, suggesting that the
MUT
KRAS clone co-existed with activating MUTEGFR since
the beginning, as also demonstrated in previous reports
[23, 24]. In these patients, MUTKRAS cannot strictly be
considered a mechanisms of resistance but it could be
possible that EGFR-TKI treatment may have favored
the expansion of MUTKRAS-positive clones. However,
conclusions cannot be drawn as pre-treatment cftDNA was
not available.

In conclusion, despite the small number of patients
involved, the retrospective analysis and the low rate of
re-biopsies, our results confirm the importance of cftDNA
analysis for the monitoring of secondary mutations
associated with EGFR-TKI resistance in NSCLC and
underline the role of a highly sensitive approach, i.e.,
ddPCR, for the detection of low-level mutations. The
clinical relevance of these findings, expecially for what
concerns MUTKRAS, needs to be evaluated prospectively.
These observations open new perspectives in the molecular
mechanisms of acquired resistance, indicating a possible
role of MUTKRAS in tumor escape from pharmacologic
treatment. The effect of MUTKRAS in NSCLC with
activating MUTEGFR needs to be further elucidated at
the molecular level and encourages the development of
inhibitors MUTKRAS for optimal treatment of patients.

Our observation is a pivotal evidence of the
presence of MUTKRAS in cftDNA of tumors with sensitizing
MUT
EGFR resistant to EGFR-TKIs. A small percentage of
our patients received EGFR-TKI as third line therapy and
a new biopsy was not repeated at this time. It could be
possible that MUTKRAS appeared before the initiation of
TKI as a mechanism of resistance to previuos therapy.
This hypotesis is weakened by the evidence that patients
given second or further lines of therapy showed TTP
and OS similar to patients treated in first line, although
a mechanism of resistance does not necessarily affect
survival. The presence of MUTKRAS has been recently
reported using next generation sequencing analysis of
tumor re-biopsies after progression under EGFR-TKI
treatment [31], similarly to colo-rectal cancer treated with
EGFR antibodies [32, 33]. It remains to be determined if
the presence of p.T790MEGFR and MUTKRAS coexist in the
same tumor cell or arise in different subclones.
Targeting MUTKRAS proteins is still a challenge
[34, 35]. Theoretically, combined treatment with KRAS
and EGFR inhibitors can be administered to patients
to prevent MUTKRAS-dependent resistance or restore
sensitivity to EGFR-TKIs, as recently demonstrated
co-targeting EGFR and MEK [36]. To date, p.T790MEGFR
remains the most important predictor of efficacy of third
generation EGFR-TKIs. Moreover, it was found that the
coexistence of both activating MUTEGFR and MUTKRAS was
not necessarily a negative predictor for EGFR-TKI therapy
[23]. With these evidences in mind, all patients with
p.T790M
EGFR should receive third generation EGFR-TKI,
even in the presence of MUTKRAS. Theoretically, it is
possible that MUTKRAS identify a less responsive subgroup
of patients but this hypothesis should be validated
by monitoring patients prospectically during secondline therapy. Beside p.T790MEGFR and MUTKRAS, other
mechanisms of acquired resistance not evaluated in our
study have been described in tumor re-biopsies after
EGFR-TKI progression, including actionable mutations

by digital droplet PCR (ddPCR, BioRad®, Hercules,
CA, USA) and ddPCR Mutation Assay (BioRad®). The
analytic procedure was unable to discriminate the nature
of the MUTKRAS because the analysis was performed with a
ddPCR KRAS Multiplex assay.
PCR reactions were assembled into individual wells
of a single-use injection molded cartridge, according to
the following protocol: 20 ng of template DNA (4 μl),
1 μl of 20X target primer/probe assay (FAM), 1 μl of 20X
wild type primer/probe assay (HEX), 10 μl of 2X ddPCR
Super Mix and 4 μl of DNAse/RNAse-free water up to a
total volume of 20 μl. Droplet generation oil (70 μl) was
then loaded and the cartridge was placed into the droplet
generator. Using vacuum, sample and oil were mixed,
generating mono-disperse droplets. Thereafter, 40 μl of
packed droplets were transferred into a 96-well PCR
plate for thermal cycling amplification. The protocol was
standardized for all mutations to the following conditions:
95°C × 10 min, 94°C × 30 s and 55°C × 60 s (35 cycles),
98°C × 10 min, and 4°C hold. The droplet reader (BioRad®)
was used for fluorescence signal quantification. The
concordance between MUTKRAS and p.T790MEGFR was
assessed on pairwise cftDNA and tissue DNA of 8 patients
who underwent re-biopsy for diagnostic purposes. DNA was
extracted from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded biopsies
using the QIAmp DNA Mini Kit (Qiagen®) and analyzed
using conventional diagnostics as reported above. As a
positive control for MUTKRAS, the cftDNA from 30 patients
with known MUTKRAS pancreatic cancer was used, while the
DNA extracted from plasma of 43 healthy blood donors was
employed as negative control for MUTKRAS and p.T790MEGFR.
