ABSTRACT
Accumulating evidence has suggested that myristoylated alanine-rich C-kinase
substrate (MARCKS) is critical for regulating multiple pathophysiological processes.
However, the molecular mechanism underlying increased phosphorylation of MARCKS
at Ser159/163 (phospho-MARCKS) and its functional consequence in neoplastic
disease remain to be established. Herein, we investigated how phospho-MARCKS
is regulated in breast carcinoma, and its role in the context of chemotherapy. In
a screen of patients with breast tumors, we find that the abundance of phosphoMARCKS, not MARCKS protein per se, increased in breast cancers and positively
correlated with tumor grade and metastatic status. Among chemotherapeutic agents,
mitotic inhibitors, including paclitaxel, vincristine or eribulin, notably promoted
phospho-MARCKS accumulation in multiple breast cancer cells. We further show
that phospho-MARCKS acted upstream of Src activation upon paclitaxel exposure.
Reduction of phospho-MARCKS by knockdown of MARCKS or pharmacological agents
increased paclitaxel sensitivity. Particularly, a known phospho-MARCKS inhibitor,
MANS peptide, was demonstrated to increase paclitaxel efficacy and attenuate
angiogenesis/metastasis of xenografted breast cancer cells by decreasing abundance
of phospho-MARCKS and messages of inflammatory mediators. Our data suggest
that unresponsiveness of breast cancer to paclitaxel treatment is, at least in part,
mediated by phospho-MARCKS and also provide an alternative therapeutic strategy
against breast cancer by improving taxanes sensitivity.

INTRODUCTION

reversibly to different sites on β-tubulin, leading to arrest
of the cell cycle and subsequent apoptosis. There are
two main modes of action within mitotic inhibitors: 1)
taxanes (which include paclitaxel and docetaxel) stabilize
microtubules and promote polymerization; 2) vinca
alkaloids and the newly approved eribulin destabilize
microtubules and prevent growth [2, 3]. Among these
agents, the taxanes have served as a standard first-line

Cytotoxic chemotherapy remains a mainstay
for breast cancer treatment, especially for recurrent or
metastatic breast cancer (MBC) [1]. Mitotic inhibitors
are one class of chemotherapeutic agents commonly
used in cancer treatment; they interfere with the dynamic
instability of spindle microtubules, most by binding

option for triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and
MBC. However, the prevalence of taxanes in earlystage treatment has contributed to the development of
chemoresistance at later stages of the disease [4-6]. A direct
comparison of paclitaxel treatment in 585 breast cancer
patients, single-agent paclitaxel as a chemotherapeutic
regimen for MBC demonstrated lower response rates
both in weekly and 3-weekly administrations (40% and
28%) [7]. This poor response to chemotherapy has created
challenges in clinical practice; and there is an urgent need
to identify a predictive marker to identify responders and
non-responders.
Dysfunctional apoptotic signaling attributes to, at
least in part, cellular resistance to chemotherapeutic agents.
Some signaling events, which minimize chemotherapy
efficacy and/or promote metastatic development, are
induced following the exposure to chemotherapy [8]. For
instance, Src-family kinases (SFKs), a family of nonreceptor tyrosine kinases, have been implicated promoting
paclitaxel resistance by activating survival pathways,
attenuating autophagy, and modulating angiogenesis
[9, 10]. Paclitaxel in particular has also been reported
to enhance epithelial-mesenchymal transition and cell
motility as well as invasive ability [11]. Tumor cells also
survive the chemotherapy through increased production of
cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors via paracrine
or autocrine [12]. Several studies have demonstrated upregulation of IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, and vascular endothelial
growth factor (VEGF) in response to paclitaxel treatment
[13-17].
Myristoylated alanine-rich C-kinase substrate
(MARCKS), predominantly those forms phosphorylated
at Ser159 and Ser163 (phospho-MARCKS), has been
extensively studied in inflammatory disease related to both
influx of inflammatory cells into the lung and release of
inflammatory mediators by these cells [18]. In particular,
a pharmacological inhibitor of MARCKS, termed MANS
peptide, is known to be capable of inhibiting cell motility,
mucus hypersecretion, and cytokine expression [1922]. Recently, increasing evidence points to phosphoMARCKS as a potential target in cancer progression [2326] and our laboratory also discovered its significance in
lung cancer [27-30]. However, the regulation of phosphoMARCKS abundance and its functional consequence in
breast cancer are yet to be elucidated.
Metastasis and resistance to chemotherapy account
for the majority of causes of treatment failure; thus, we
have three aims in this study: 1) to establish clinical
relevance of phospho-MARCKS in breast cancer; 2) to
characterize the functional roles of phospho-MARCKS in
response to chemotherapy in vitro; and 3) to determine
whether pharmacological inhibition of MARCKS by the
MANS peptide improves paclitaxel efficacy in vivo. Our
studies point to the critical role of phospho-MARCKS
in the unresponsiveness of breast cancer to taxanes and
suggest that phospho-MARCKS is a druggable target to

overcome resistance to paclitaxel.

RESULTS
Increased MARCKS phosphorylation is
associated with metastatic potential of breast
cancer
To investigate the role of phospho-MARCKS
(Ser159/163) in breast cancer, we evaluated phosphoMARCKS abundance by IHC analysis in primary tumor
tissue sections from 21 patients with breast carcinomas.
The IHC results were classified into two groups according
to the intensity and extent of staining, as described in
“Methods”. Samples that were strong positive (score =
+3) were defined as high phospho-MARCKS. Comparing
to adjacent normal breast tissues, high phospho-MARCKS
was detected in 86% (n = 18/21) of breast tumor
specimens (Figure 1A, left). Strikingly, abundant phosphoMARCKS staining in samples was significantly greater in
patients with distant metastases (M1) compared to patients
with no distant metastases (M0), at a rate of 100% (n =
13/13) versus 62% (n = 5/8) (Figure 1A, right; p = 0.042).
To ascertain whether phospho-MARCKS is associated
with invasive/metastatic potential of breast cancer, we
then validated the phospho-MARCKS signal abundance
in another cohort of patients (n = 50) with various types
of breast tumors, including primary and lymph node
metastatic tumors (Figure 1B, left and Supplementary
Table S1). Interestingly, phospho-MARCKS signals
were significantly lower in noninvasive tumors compared
to those invasive breast carcinomas and lymph node
metastatic tumors (Figure 1B, right; p = 0.048). A positive
correlation between tumor grade and phospho-MARCKS
was established (Supplementary Table S1; p = 0.005).
However, there was no significant association of total
MARCKS abundance with aggressive phenotype.
We next assessed phospho-MARCKS and total
MARCKS abundance in some breast cancer cell lines
(Supplementary Figure S1). Western blots demonstrated
that both phospho-MARCKS and MARCKS expressions
were higher in the invasive breast cancer cell lines, MDAMB-231 and MDA-MB-468 [31]. To determine whether
an increase in phospho-MARCKS or total MARCKS
abundance promotes breast cancer cell invasiveness
and motility, we used a MARCKS-specific short hairpin
RNA (MARCKS-shRNA) to deplete endogenous
MARCKS, then followed by re-expression of wildtype or S159/163A-MARCKS. As shown in Figures
1C and 1D, silencing MARCKS expression in high
MARCKS-expressing MDA-MB-231 cells resulted in
reducing cancer invasion and migration as compared to
control shRNA-transduced cells. Whereas reconstituted
wild-type MARCKS restored invasive phenotype,

that regulate the efficacy of paclitaxel [9]. However,
steady state MARCKS expression remained unchanged
in paclitaxel-treated cells. A similar phenomenon was
recapitulated in ER-positive MCF7 cells upon paclitaxel
stimulation (Supplementary Figure S3B). To determine the
major kinase that phosphorylated MARCKS in response to
paclitaxel, a potent pan-PKC inhibitor (250 nM Calphostin
C) was used in combination with paclitaxel to treat these
cells. Western blot analyses demonstrated that Calphostin
C suppressed paclitaxel-dependent up-regulation of
phospho-MARCKS in all these cells (Figure 3B and
Supplementary Figure S3C). In an attempt to define the
specific PKC isoforms involved in paclitaxel-enhanced
phospho-MARCKS, cells were preincubated with various
isoform-specific PKC inhibitors for 30 minutes followed
by co-incubation with paclitaxel. We found that two of the
inhibitors, alpha-isoform-selective (Gö6976) and deltaisoform-selective (Rottlerin) PKC inhibitors, reduced
phospho-MARCKS abundance in paclitaxel-treated cells
(Supplementary Figure S3D). Next, co-treatment with
a Src inhibitor (100 nM Dasatinib) was performed to
examine whether the elevated phospho-MARCKS was
through activated Src. Figure 3C reveals that phosphoMARCKS abundance persisted, in the presence of Src
inhibitor, following the exposure to paclitaxel. Instead,
knockdown of MARCKS decreased Src pTyr416
abundance in TNBC cells (Supplementary Figure S3E).
To expand on the above finding, the effect of several
mitotic inhibitors on phospho-MARCKS abundance
was investigated. Remarkably, phospho-MARCKS was
up-regulated by vincristine and eribulin in addition to
paclitaxel (Figure 3D). We also observed an association
between abundances of phospho-MARCKS and phosphoHistone H3 (Ser10), a surrogate marker for mitosis.
Treatment with a new anti-mitotic agent, eribulin, also
resulted in Ro31-8220, a pan-PKC inhibitor, -sensitive
increase of phospho-MARCKS in MDA-MB-468, MDAMB-231 and MCF7 cells (Figure 3E and Supplementary
Figure S3F). These data convincingly demonstrate that
phospho-MARCKS increased upon the inhibition of breast
cancer cell mitosis.

Implications of phospho-MARCKS levels in
mitotic inhibitor paclitaxel-induced cytotoxicity
Since chemotherapy has been used to treat all stages
of breast cancer, particularly MBCs [1], we examined
the effect of chemotherapy treatment on phosphoMARCKS abundance. Three breast cancer cell lines
were treated with different chemotherapeutic agents,
including cisplatin, paclitaxel, doxorubicin or etoposide.
Figure 2A shows that there was an increase in phosphoMARCKS in the cells exposed to a mitotic inhibitor,
paclitaxel, over vehicle-treated counterparts, whereas no
significant sensitizing effect was noted in cells treated
with other chemotherapeutic agents. We next asked if
elevated phospho-MARCKS abundance is associated
with decreased breast cancer cell survival in response
to chemotherapy. shRNA silencing approach was used
to eliminate MARCKS in two TNBC cell lines with
abundant phospho-MARCKS, MDA-MB-231 and MDAMB-468 (Supplementary Figure S1). Cells were exposed
to cisplatin, paclitaxel, doxorubicin or etoposide for 72
hours. Cell viability was reduced by 31% (Figure 2B, left)
and 40% (Figure 2C, left), respectively, by MARCKSshRNA, compared to that in cells receiving control-shRNA
after paclitaxel treatment. Knockdown of MARCKS did
not significantly enhance cytotoxicity of any additional
chemotherapeutic agents examined. Likewise, data from
MTS assays also supported that MARCKS-knockdown
cells were more sensitive to paclitaxel (Supplementary
Figure S2). Western blots revealed increased caspase-3
cleavage, hallmark of caspase-3 activation, in these
silenced cells upon paclitaxel exposure (Figures 2B and
2C, right). Altogether, these data suggest that phosphoMARCKS abundance is inversely associated with the
efficacy of paclitaxel in TNBC cells.

To further validate the role of phospho-MARCKS
in conveying paclitaxel resistance in breast cancer cells,
we performed a dose-course analysis of MDA-MB-468
cells undergoing paclitaxel treatment. We showed
that there was no apoptotic effect in these cells in the
presence of paclitaxel at concentrations from 0 to 20
nM (Supplementary Figure S3A). Notably, phosphoMARCKS abundance increased in a concentrationdependent manner (Figure 3A), concomitant with
induced Src activation, which crosstalk with mechanisms

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

We previously reported that the use of MANS
peptide, which targets the N-terminal myristoylation site
in MARCKS, was able to reduce phospho-MARCKS
levels in lung cancer [27]. Through the combination
treatment of breast cancer using MANS peptide and
paclitaxel, we confirmed that MANS peptide has an
inhibitory effect on paclitaxel-enhanced MARCKS
phosphorylation, as PKC inhibitor did (Figure 4A).

Since PKC participates in multiple complex signaling
cascades, we used MANS peptide to specifically block
the effect of phospho-MARCKS on paclitaxel resistance.
MTS assays showed that the combination of paclitaxel
(1.25 - 40 nM) with 100 μM MANS peptide resulted in
a decrease of paclitaxel IC50 (half maximal inhibitory
concentration) from 53.98 to 27.60 nM in MDA-MB-231
cells (Figure 4B). This combined effect was also noted
of MDA-MB-468 cells (Figure 4C). Similarly, analysis

of clonogenic abilities revealed that the co-treatment with
100 μM of MANS peptide increased the anti-proliferation
activity of paclitaxel approximately 3.8-fold (Figure
4D). MANS-treated cells showed a marked elevation of
cleaved caspase-3 and PARP in response to paclitaxel
(Figure 4E). The results suggest that high phosphoMARCKS abundance caused by paclitaxel contributes to
the resistance to paclitaxel in breast cancer cells.

that VEGFA, IL-6, IL-8, and Cox-2 expression in
MARCKS-silenced cells were decreased to 14%, 20%,
27% and 20%, respectively (Figure 6C). As expected,
a similar inhibition of angiogenic factors was seen in
breast cancer cells with combination treatment of 10 nM
of paclitaxel and 100 μM of MANS peptide (Figure 6D).
These data suggest a potential role for MANS peptide to
suppress angiogenic activity.

To confirm whether MARCKS inhibition by MANS
peptide promotes anti-tumor activity of paclitaxel in vivo,
MDA-MB-468 cells were injected orthotopically into
the fat pads of nude mice. After tumors were palpable
in all animals (see Methods), cohorts of mice were
intraperitoneally injected with vehicle, MANS peptide
(12.5 mg/kg), paclitaxel (3 mg/kg) alone or together
with MANS peptide (12.5 mg/kg) every three days for
7 injections (n = 5 mice/group). Tumor size was greatly
reduced in the paclitaxel plus MANS-treated group,
whereas the other three groups showed continuous growth
(Figure 5A). As shown in Figure 5B, the combination of
MANS peptide and paclitaxel elicited a 2.6-fold growth
inhibition of breast tumors, compared to the vehicle
group. In contrast, treatment with either MANS peptide
or paclitaxel alone resulted in marginal growth inhibition.
Additionally, IHC staining showed a concomitant
increase of phospho-MARCKS and phospho-Src levels
in xenografted tumors receiving paclitaxel alone (Figure
5C). In the combination-treated group, levels of phosphoMARCKS and phospho-Src were reduced to 31% and
27%, respectively. Reduced proliferation and increased
cell death were also observed in the combination-treated
tumors by measuring abundance of PCNA, a proliferation
marker; and activated caspase-3, a hallmark of apoptosis.

Inhibition of phospho-MARCKS
angiogenic activity of breast cancer

DISCUSSION
A number of chemoresistance-associated signaling
pathways have been identified in breast cancer. However,
many of these molecules are not specific and implicated
in resistance to a wide range of chemotherapeutic agents.
The results of this study identified a specific target
for predicting unresponsiveness of breast cancer to
paclitaxel. First, elevated phospho-MARCKS abundance
was positively correlated with poor differentiation and
invasion/metastasis of breast tumors. Second, phosphoMARCKS abundance accumulated in response to the
treatment of breast cancer cells with mitotic inhibitors,
particularly paclitaxel. Lastly, knockdown of MARCKS
or pharmacologic agents reduced paclitaxel-induced
phospho-MARCKS and improved responsiveness of
breast cancer cells to paclitaxel, both in vitro and in vivo.
In addition to this anti-apoptotic effect, we also suggest
a novel function of phospho-MARCKS to promote
angiogenic activity, thereby tumor growth and metastasis.
Collectively, these results demonstrate critical roles of
phospho-MARCKS in the regulation of breast cancer
malignancy and paclitaxel resistance.
Metastasis, the most common cause of death in
breast cancer cases, poses substantial difficulties to
treatment. The increased emphasis on individualized
treatment has necessitated the identification of new
biomarkers for metastasis, a goal which has not yet been
fully realized [33]. Consistent with other cancers [23, 24,
27, 28], elevated phospho-MARCKS was associated with
metastatic potential of breast cancer. The invasion and
wound healing assays revealed an association between
increased invasiveness and motility of breast cancer cells
and up-regulation of MARCKS phosphorylation at the
Ser159 and Ser163 sites. We then uncovered that downregulation of phospho-MARCKS was able to reduce
intravasation of cancer cells, microvessel density and
angiogenic factors, hallmarks of metastatic development
of breast cancer [32], in our xenograft model. These
results attest the contribution of phospho-MARCKS to
metastatic progression and the potential usage of phosphoMARCKS as a marker in predicting risk of metastasis in
breast cancer patients.
Unequivocally, our results show that paclitaxel
treatment causes a rapid increase in phospho-MARCKS
abundance. We further speculate that phospho-MARCKS
directly contributes to paclitaxel resistance, albeit the

impairs

The process of new blood vessel formation is
known to play a central role in supporting tumor growth
and metastasis in breast cancer [32]. According to the
findings in Figure 5, we postulated that tumor growth
may be reduced partially through inhibition of tumor
vasculature. To test this hypothesis, we assessed CD31stained cells in these xenograft tumors and found a
decrease in tumor microvessel density (MVD) in the
tumors receiving paclitaxel plus MANS peptide (Figure
6A, top; mean MVD, 0.7% area). Unexpectedly, MVD
in the tumors receiving MANS peptide alone was less
than that in the paclitaxel-treated group (mean MVD,
1.8% area for MANS peptide alone and 4.5% area for
paclitaxel alone). In addition to intra-tumor area, the
combination of paclitaxel and MANS peptide treatment
caused the greatest reduction in vascular number and
size in the periphery of tumor mass. Of note, we found
several cancer cells within the neovasculature of tumors
treated with vehicle or paclitaxel alone (Figure 6B). To
explore whether MARCKS inhibition interferes with the
angiogenic activity of breast cancer, we examined the
expression of several angiogenic factors after knockdown
of MARCKS. Analysis of mRNA expression demonstrated

an average of 100 mm3 at the injected site, mice were randomly grouped for intraperitoneal injection, once every three days with either

underlying mechanism remains to be validated. Among
multiple chemotherapeutic agents used in treatment
of breast cancers, only mitotic inhibitors increased
phospho-MARCKS abundance. Conversely, reduction
of phospho-MARCKS increased susceptibility of breast
cancer cells to paclitaxel, while having a modest effect
on the susceptibility to other chemotherapeutics. There
are currently no biomarkers for predicting paclitaxel
resistance that are applicable in a clinical setting;
numerous candidates have been studied, but in most
cases, no consensus has been reached [6]. Furthermore,
many of the candidates studied would not be practical
as specific markers for taxanes resistance; for example,
P-glycoprotein, a member of the ATP-binding cassette
transporter family, not only confers taxanes resistance
but also participates in multiple drug resistance including
resistance to anthracyclines and etoposides [34].
The major function of mitotic inhibitors is to
interfere with spindle microtubule dynamics, causing cell
cycle arrest and apoptosis [2, 3]. To address the possibility
that persistent elevation of phospho-MARCKS predispose
breast cancer cells to the treatment of paclitaxel, there are
two possible mechanisms by which elevated phosphoMARCKS attenuates the anti-cancer efficacy of paclitaxel.
First, phospho-MARCKS in breast cancer acts upstream
Src activation, which has been documented in the
regulation of paclitaxel resistance [9, 10]. This indicates
that the elevation of phospho-MARCKS functions in
activating Src signaling, ultimately leading to activation
of cell-survival pathways to confer drug resistance.
Alternatively, phospho-MARCKS could stimulate the
expression of pro-inflammatory mediators, such as VEGF,
IL-6 and IL-8. This is supported by results shown in Figure
6D that several messages for pro-inflammatory mediators
increased in paclitaxel-treated cells. Conceivably, upregulation of phospho-MARCKS-dependent production
of cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors not only
promotes inflammation events but also plays a critical
role in tumor proliferation, angiogenesis, and metastasis
[35-37].
During in the course of chemotherapeutic
treatment, many drugs not only lose their efficacy due
to chemoresistance, but also worsen the situation by
contributing to metastasis themselves [38]. It has been
suggested that chemotherapy-induced changes in the
tumor microenvironment could attribute to its associated
metastatic progression. For example, inflammation, a
tumor-promoting factor, is well known to have a role
in conveying the failure of therapy and promoting
metastasis. Many studies have demonstrated that in
response to paclitaxel administration, cancer cells upregulate inflammatory mediators such as IL-1β, IL-6, IL8, and VEGF-A, which also facilitate angiogenic activity
[13-17]. Moreover, paclitaxel treatment can promote
epithelial-mesenchymal transition, pseudopodia formation
and cell migration [11]. Previously, MANS peptide, a
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

pharmacological inhibitor of MARCKS, was shown
to reduce MARCKS phosphorylation, inflammatory
cytokine productions and cell motility [18, 20, 22, 27,
39]. Here, we showed that MANS peptide attenuates
the effect of paclitaxel-induced phospho-MARCKS
and enhances the paclitaxel sensitivity of breast cancer.
In addition to blocking phospho-MARCKS-associated
functions, it is possible that MANS peptide may suppress
paclitaxel-induced inflammation directly or indirectly,
thereby improving the anti-tumor ability of paclitaxel.
The combination treatment of paclitaxel and MANS
peptide demonstrated here both in vitro and in vivo studies
suggests that MANS or a similar peptide that blocks
paclitaxel-mediated elevation of phospho-MARCKS
could be further tested in clinical trials as an adjuvant to
chemotherapeutics for breast cancer.
Angiogenesis is another pathway of creating
a microenvironment favorable to tumor growth and
metastasis [32, 35]. In particular, paclitaxel treatment has
been shown to up-regulate VEGF expression, increase
mobilization of circulating endothelial cells, induce
production of endothelial cell progenitors, and enhance
tumor-cell homing and adhesion to endothelial cells [17,
40-42]. Although most effects by anti-angiogenic therapy
on tumor expansion appeared to be transient in both
preclinical and clinical settings [43], several studies have
demonstrated that targeting angiogenic factors, mainly
VEGF, improves the efficacy of paclitaxel in suppressing
metastasis and prolonging progression-free survival [16,
44]. Consistent with these findings, we found an increase
in microvessel density and angiogenic factors in paclitaxeltreated xenografted breast tumors. However, MARCKS
inhibition clearly repressed angiogenic activity in both
MANS-treated groups. Xenografted tumors receiving
MANS alone showed a suppression of microvessel density
but no tumor regression. MANS-treatment, similar to the
anti-VEGF therapy [45], might prune and normalize the
tumor vasculature than shrink the tumor per se. Previous
studies have established the role of phospho-MARCKS in
directing cell movement of vascular endothelial cells [46];
our results herein coupled with their findings not only
confirm that up-regulation of phospho-MARCKS plays a
critical role in tumor-related angiogenesis, but also suggest
that phospho-MARCKS is a previously unrecognized,
useful target for combination therapy regimes that seek
to synergistically enhance paclitaxel efficacy by targeting
angiogenesis.
TNBCs are a heterogeneous group of tumors that
lack estrogen and progesterone receptors and do not
over-express human epidermal growth factor receptor
2 (HER-2/neu). Unlike non-TNBCs, TNBCs tend to be
highly malignant and patients with TNBCs have poor
prognosis [47]. Most TNBCs are histologically classified
as high grade invasive ductal carcinoma. In our clinical
observations, phospho-MARCKS levels were significantly
increased in invasive ductal carcinoma and high grade
15204

tumors. Actually, some of TNBC-associated molecules
have been identified, such as PI3K/AKT, Src and VEGF.
Unfortunately, inhibition of these signaling pathways
via their inhibitors either is still under investigation or
has failed in the early trials [48-50]. As our results have
demonstrated, phospho-MARCKS is involved in the
regulation of Src activity and VEGF expression in TNBC
cells. Moreover, it has been documented that phosphoMARCKS levels function in the PI3K/AKT pathway [27,
46]. These findings indicate that phospho-MARCKS is
a critical molecule in promoting malignancy in TNBCs.
Indeed, our study demonstrates that elevated phosphoMARCKS augments a variety of signaling pathways and
tumor behaviors, including invasion/metastasis, induction
of angiogenesis and paclitaxel resistance in TNBC cell
lines such as MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells.
Accordingly, it is logical that targeting phospho-MARCKS
could simultaneously attenuate several pro-inflammatory
or pro-metastatic pathways in TNBCs. Due to the lack of a
proven therapeutic target, treatment of TNBCs may benefit
from the suppression of elevated phospho-MARCKS;
and the combination therapy consisting of paclitaxel and
MARCKS inhibitors may therefore aid in the development
of novel treatment strategies for patients with TNBCs and
other treatment refractory ER- or HER-2-positive breast
cancers.
In summary, we provide evidence that mitotic
inhibitors, notably paclitaxel, cause a rapid activation of
phospho-MARCKS, thereby resistance to paclitaxel. The
use of paclitaxel alongside with MARCKS inhibitors or
molecules that can block phospho-MARCKS-mediated
functions may improve paclitaxel efficacy and permit
lower doses of paclitaxel to be used. Importantly, it is
plausible that phospho-MARCKS serves as an informative
biomarker and druggable target for paclitaxel resistance in
breast cancer.

knockdown, viruses were produced by co-transfection of
HEK293T cells with the appropriate MARCKS shRNAcontaining lentiviral vector and a packing DNA mix,
using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Host cells were
transduced with lentiviral constructs at three different
Multiplicities of Infection (MOIs) in polybrene (8 µg/mL)containing medium. Twenty-four hours after infection,
the cells were treated with puromycin (2 µg/mL) and
puromycin-resistant clones were selected and pooled.

Patient
tumor
specimens
immunohistochemical staining

Two cohorts of breast tumors (which include
21 and 50 patients) were obtained from patients with
histologically confirmed breast tumors who underwent
surgical resection at the City of Hope National Medical
Center (Duarte, CA) and UC Davis Medical Center
(Sacramento, CA), respectively. This investigation was
approved by the Institutional Review Board of the City
of Hope National Medical Center and UC Davis Health
System. Written informed consent was obtained from
all patients. Formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded
specimens were used, and immunohistochemical staining
was performed for phospho-MARCKS levels as well as
MARCKS expression as described previously [27-29].
Detailed information on staining scoring is included in the
Supplementary Methods.

Cell invasion assay
In vitro cell invasion assays were performed as
previously described [27] using transwell chambers (8 µm
pore size; Costar, Cambridge, MA). Filters were coated
with matrigel (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ), and
2 × 104 cells were seeded onto the matrigel. After 20 hours
of incubation, filters were swabbed with a cotton swab,
fixed with methanol and then stained with Giemsa solution
(Sigma, St Louis, MO). The cells attached to the lower
surface of the filter were counted under a light microscope.

Scratch wound-healing assay

All reagents, primers and antibodies used in this
study are described in the Supplementary Methods.

Cells were seeded to six-well tissue culture dishes
and grown to confluence. Each confluent monolayer was
then wounded linearly using a pipette tip, and washed
three times with PBS. Thereafter, cell morphology and
migration were observed and photographed at 16 hours.
The number of cells migrating into the cell-free zone was
acquired under a light microscope.

Cell culture and lentiviral short hairpin RNA–
mediated knockdown
Breast cancer cell lines, MDA-MB-231, MDAMB-468, and MCF7 cells were purchased from the
American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) (Manassas,
VA). Cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s
medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillinstreptomycin at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere of 5%
CO2. For lentivirus-based short hairpin RNA-mediated

Methods.

Trypan blue exclusion test and MTS assay were
used to quantitate viable cell numbers. For Trypan blue
test, cells were plated on 12-well plates and treated with
the indicated chemotherapeutic agents. After 72 hours,
both attached and detached cells were collected and then
stained with 0.2% trypan blue (0.1% final concentration),
and the number of trypan blue-positive and -negative cells
was counted using a haemocytometer under low-power
microscopy. For a MTS assay, cells were seeded into 96well plates and cultured for the indicated treatment. Cell
viability was evaluated by the MTS assay according to
the manufacturer’s protocol (Promega, Madison, WI).
The absorbance measured at 490 nm was on a multiwell scanning spectrophotometer (Victor3; Perkin-Elmer,
Boston, MA). For the anchorage-dependent growth assay,
200 cells were seeded in each well of 6-well plates. Cells
were treated with paclitaxel and MANS peptide at the
indicated concentrations for 5 days and then changed to
the complete culture medium; these cells were further
incubated for 5 days. Colonies were stained using 0.001%
crystal violet and the number of colonies with a diameter
greater than 0.5 mm was counted under an inverted
microscope.

Statistical analysis
Data are presented either as the mean ± SD or the
mean ± SE of at least three independent experiments.
The quantitative in vitro and in vivo data were analyzed
using the Student’s t-test. The difference in patient
characteristics between the high-expression and the lowexpression groups was analyzed using Fisher’s exact test.
All analyses were performed using SPSS software (v20.0;
SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL). All statistical tests were twosided, and p values < 0.05 were considered statistically
significant.
