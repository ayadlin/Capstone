Abstract
Single-cell DNA sequencing of two breast-cancer types has shown extensive mutational variation
in individual tumours, confirming that generation of genetic diversity may be inherent in how
tumours evolve.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Next-generation DNA sequencing has revolutionized the field of cancer genomics1.
Although this sequencing can identify the most frequent mutation in a population of cells, it
struggles to resolve the mutational diversity and multiple genomes of the individual cells
that comprise a tumour. Achieving DNA sequencing down to the resolution of a single cell
has been a long-held dream for understanding the cellular heterogeneity that is inherent in
many complex biological systems and, in particular, for delineating the mixture of genomes
in human cancers2. On page 155 of this issue, Wang et al.3 report an innovative sequencing
method, termed nuc-seq, that achieves almost complete sequencing of whole genomes in
single cells.

As a cell prepares to divide, it replicates the DNA in its nucleus. By sorting and sequencing
only the newly ‘doubled’ nuclei, nuc-seq takes advantage of this duplication to achieve
lower rates of sequencing errors than most previous techniques4. The authors validated their
method using targeted duplex sequencing, a protocol that sequences both strands of DNA to
identify mutations at exceptionally high accuracy5. They suggest that the use of nuc-seq to
sequence single-cell genomes, with validation by targeted deep sequencing, will be
instrumental in defining the genomic heterogeneity of cancers.
To demonstrate this, Wang et al. used their technique to sequence the genomes of multiple
single cells from two types of human breast cancer, and found that no two individual tumour
cells were genetically identical. As well as the large numbers of mutations that are common
to the majority of cells in a tumour, the authors uncovered an even greater number of
subclonal and de novo mutations (those that are unique to individual cells). They also
present estimates, derived from mathematical models, of mutation rates of single cells
within tumours. On the basis of these models, they show that distinct types of DNA
alteration seem to accumulate at different rates in different tumours, and suggest that two
separate ‘mutational clocks’ operate in cancer. Large-scale, structural changes in DNA (such
as amplification and deletion of large blocks of DNA) probably occur early in tumour
development, in punctuated bursts of evolution, whereas point mutations may accumulate
more gradually, generating extensive subclonal diversity. The authors’ findings indicate that
slower-growing ‘luminal’ breast-cancer cells exhibit relatively low mutation rates, whereas

cells from clinically more aggressive, ‘triple-negative’ breast cancers have mutation rates
that are 13 times greater than in normal cells.

Nuc-seq and comparable single-cell sequencing methods6–9 will allow a more detailed
understanding of mutational heterogeneity in individual tumours, and will influence our
understanding of how cancers evolve and our approach to their treatment. In particular,
mutational diversity within a tumour is likely to be predictive of whether resistance to a
particular chemotherapy will emerge during treatment, because mutations in genes that
render cells resistant to specific drugs may exist before initiation of therapy. This has
previously been documented for the failure of certain molecularly tailored cancer
treatments10. Such findings also reinforce the fact that single, bulk sampling of a tumour —
a strategy that is commonly used to select targeted therapies — is not representative of the
tumour as a whole.

The total number of mutations that a tumour genome carries, including those present in only
a small subset of cells, may in fact underlie the aggressiveness of different cancer subtypes.
For example, the extent of genetic diversity within a tumour, and its divergence from normal
tissue, probably influences the ability of the immune system to distinguish malignant cells
from normal cells. Identifying the mechanisms by which cancer cells generate mutational
heterogeneity may therefore present previously unexplored therapeutic targets.
An array of techniques to analyse individual cells has now been developed. It remains to be
seen, however, just how robust nuc-seq and other single-cell genomics techniques, such as
MALBAC6, will prove to be. For example, many cancer cells are aneuploid (they carry
abnormal numbers of chromosomes), and the application of nuc-seq may be restricted to
cancers that do not exhibit aneuploidy. Also, although the cost of genome sequencing
continues to decline (albeit more slowly now than in the past), the cost of single-cell
genomics and the complexities of the bioinformatic analyses involved are still formidable.

In our quest to decipher cancer genomes, the advent of single-cell sequencing marks a
technical milestone. It crystallizes the concept that the genome of each tumour is dynamic
and highly diverse, whether we are comparing cancer genomes between tumours of different
patients, between anatomically distinct regions of a tumour within a patient or even between
individual cells within the same tumour (Fig. 1). Single-cell sequencing will allow us to
detect rare mutant subpopulations hidden within cancers that could expand and lead to drug
resistance, and thus to avoid unnecessary and potentially harmful administration of
ineffective, toxic therapies. Ultimately, the exceptional plasticity of the tumour genome may
well prove to be a key characteristic of cancer11 and a major, as yet untapped, therapeutic
vulnerability.

The genetic characteristics of cancers vary between patients, between primary and
metastatic tumours in a single patient, and between the individual cells of a tumour. Wang et
al.3 present a single-cell, whole-genome sequencing technique that will allow a better
understanding of genetic heterogeneity within individual tumours.
