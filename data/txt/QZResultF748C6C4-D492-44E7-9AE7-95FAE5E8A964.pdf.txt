ABSTRACT:
Here we discuss the latest progress in development of some kinase inhibitors such
as inhibitors of c-MET, LIM and Bcr-Abl kinases. Importantly, many oncogenic kinases
signal via the mTOR pathway, suggesting a common target for drug combinations.

Met tyrosine kinase receptor signaling is activated
by its ligand, hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor
(HGF/SF) [1, 2]. MET signaling in turn increases
glycolysis, oxidative phosporylation, and tumor blood
volume [3]. It was shown that HGF/SF-activated Met
increased Ras activity, Erk phosphorylation and cell
motility [3]. Tang et al. compared the demographic
and clinical characteristics of ovarian cancer patients
with MET altered patients and their response to c-Met
inhibitors [4]. MET nonsynonomous nucleotide variations
and amplification occurred in 7.4% and 3.5% of patients,
respectively. MET variations were observed only in
white women with high-grade ovarian tumors, whereas
amplifications were detected in both black and white
women with high-grade serous ovarian primary tumors.
MET alterations have been associated with resistance to
therapy [5]. Thus, patients exhibiting a MET alteration
did not achieve an objective response by a c-Met inhibitor
therapy [4]. Preclinical experiments have shown that the
simultaneous use of two inhibitors anti-Met and antiEGFR significantly enhance the effectiveness of tumor
growth inhibition [6]. C-MET amplified subpopulation of
cells existed prior to anti-EGFR treatment supporting idea
co-treatment of patients with Met and EGFR therapies [7].
MET amplification in colorectal carcinomas associated
with resistance to cetuximab and panitumumab [8]. Taken
together these results provide a strong rationale for the use
of Met inhibitors to overcome drug-resistance to EGFR
therapies.
Importantly, activators of c-MET are secreted
by adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells, which
exacerbate oncogenic behaviour of c-Met-expressing
breast cancer cells, creating an inflammatory
microenvironment, thus increasing tumor growth and
angiogenesis. c-Met expression is a predictive factor of

cancer recurrence after autologous fat graft in post-surgery
breast cancer patients [9].
Recently nuclear factor Îº-B kinase (IKK) was
identified a novel signaling mechanism for the regulation
of mTORC2. A new inhibitor of IKK Bay 11-7082 interacts
with Rictor and regulates the activity complex mTORC2.
Rictor phosphorylation at T1135 was also inhibited
by the IKK inhibitor Bay 11-7082 [10]. IKK regulates
mTORC2 activity including phosphorylating AKT at
the serine 473 and actin cytoskeleton reorganization,
which is controlled by LIM kinases. The LIM kinases are
promising oncotarget in several types of cancer [11-13].
The main substrate of LIM kinase is cofilin, an actindepolymerizing factor. LIMK1, a modulator of actin
and microtubule dynamics, is involved in the mitotic
process through inactivating phosphorylation of cofilin
[14]. LIMK2 increases resistance to chemotherapeutic
agents in neuroblastoma cells by regulating drug-induced
cell cycle arrest [15]. A LIMK inhibitor, T56-LIMKi,
inhibits LIMK2 with high specificity, while not inhibiting
LIMK1 [13]. T56-LIMKi decreases phosphorylated
cofilin (p-cofilin) levels and inhibits growth of glioma,
schwannoma and pancreatic cancer. T56-LIMKi reduced
tumor size and p-cofilin levels in the pancreatic tumors
[13]. Also, thioredoxin inhibition is emerging as attractive
strategy [16-18] especially employing already existing
drugs such as Disulfiram for novel use [16, 19, 20].
Although tyrosine kinase inhibitors have changed
therapy of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), acquired
resistance to imatinib, dasatinib or nilotinib, due to
BCR-ABL1 kinase mutations, limits the therapy. Also,
hematopoietic niche could protect leukemic cells from
therapy [21]. Aggoune et al demonstrated that T315I
mutants need either compound mutations such as E255K/
T315I or a stromal niche to escape from the toxicity of
1157

ponatinib [21]. Thus the hematopoietic niche plays a
crucial role in conferring resistance to ponatinib, by
increasing cell survival and genetic instability [21]. This
is especially striking given that chronic myelogenous cells
that are resistant to all kinase inhibitors are still highly
sensitive to ponatinib [22, 23].
Inhibitors of the mTOR pathway sensitize chronic
myeloid leukemia stem cells to nilotinib and restore the
response of progenitors to nilotinib in the presence of stem
cell factor [24-26]. Inhibitors of mTOR also sensitized
tumor cells to other kinase inhibitors [27]. Noteworthy,
the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin (sirolimus) also prevents
cancer in animal models [28-36]. Rapamycin slows
down organism aging [37-58], by preventing cellular
geroconversion to senescence [59-70]. And everything that
slows down aging in turn prevents cancer because cancer
is an age-related disease [71, 72].
