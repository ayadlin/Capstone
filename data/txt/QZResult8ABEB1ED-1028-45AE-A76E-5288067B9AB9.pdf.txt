Abstract
Tumors often display mechanisms to avoid or suppress immune recognition. One such mechanism is the
shedding of gangliosides into the local tumor microenvironment, and a high concentration of circulating
gangliosides is associated with poor prognosis. In this study, we identify ganglioside GD3, which was isolated
from the polar lipid fraction of ovarian cancer–associated ascites, as an inhibitory factor that prevents innate
immune activation of natural killer T (NKT) cells. Puriﬁed GD3 displayed a high afﬁnity for both human and
mouse CD1d, a molecule involved in the presentation of lipid antigens to T cells. Puriﬁed GD3, as well as
substances within the ascites, bound to the CD1d antigenic-binding site and did not require additional
processing for its inhibitory effect on NKT cells. Importantly, in vivo administration of GD3 inhibited
a-galactosylceramide (a-GalCer)-induced NKT cell activation in a dose-dependent manner. These data
therefore indicate that ovarian cancer tumors may use GD3 to inhibit the antitumor NKT cell response as an
early mechanism of tumor immune evasion. Cancer Res; 72(15); 3744–52. 2012 AACR.

Introduction
In the United States, ovarian cancer ranks ﬁfth as a cause of
cancer-related deaths among women (1). Unfortunately, the
majority of cases are diagnosed at an advanced stage, leading to
poor overall survival. By the time of presentation, ovarian cancer
has often undergone successive accumulation of multiple
molecular alterations. Therefore, each tumor tends to be molecularly distinct, increasing the difﬁculty of identifying a common
molecular target with prognostic or therapeutic potential.
Patients with ovarian cancer often present with ovarian
cancer–associated ascites, which contains cellular compoAuthors' Afﬁliations: 1Department of Pathology and The Kelly Gynecologic Oncology Service; 2Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, The

nents of the immune system such as lymphocytes and natural
killer T (NKT) cells, regulatory factors, such as cytokines, and
potential immune inhibitory factors. It has been reported that
patients with advanced ovarian cancer have higher levels of
gangliosides in their plasma and ascites than plasma ganglioside levels in controls (2). Furthermore, abnormal ganglioside
expression is strongly associated with clinically aggressive
malignancies. Thus patients with cancer who have high circulating ganglioside levels at the time of clinical diagnosis
exhibit a faster rate of disease progression and a decreased
survival rate (3).
One of the earliest pathways in immune activation is the
presentation of phospho/glycolipid antigens on CD1d molecules to NKT cells. NKT cells are primed cells that have large
reservoirs of cytokines such as IFN-g and TNF-a. These cells
can, if appropriately activated, induce the development of a
robust adaptive immune response. Many studies have characterized the adaptive T-cell immune response in ovarian
cancer (4–8). However, mechanisms of immune evasion by
ovarian cancers, speciﬁcally those affecting the NKT cell/CD1d
system, remain to be elucidated.
Here, we identiﬁed the ganglioside GD3 as a major factor
in ovarian cancer ascites ﬂuid that inhibited NKT cell
activation. Mechanistically, we found that antigen processing was not required as CD1d-Ig dimers loaded with
a-galactosylceramide (a-GalCer) were no longer recognized
by NKT cells following treatment with GD3 and that pulsing
CD1d-Ig–based artiﬁcial antigen-presenting cells (aAPC)
with GD3 or ascites ﬂuid led to inhibition of NKT activation.
Furthermore, GD3 bound with high afﬁnity to both human
and mouse CD1d, and in vivo treatment with GD3 inhibited
a-GalCer–mediated NKT cell activation. These data indicate
that ganglioside shedding may be an early mechanism of

GD3 Inhibits CD1d-Mediated NKT Cell Activation

Mice
Six- to eight-week-old C57BL/6 mice were purchased from
the Jackson Laboratory or Janvier and were maintained in the
animal facility at New York University School of Medicine (New
York, NY) and at the University of Bonn (Bonn, Germany) under
pathogen-free conditions.
Cell lines
Murine L cells transfected with wild-type cd1d1 cDNA
(LCD1dwt) were kindly provided by R.R. Brutkiewicz (Indiana
University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN; ref. 9) in 2005.
The cell lines used have been tested and authenticated routinely by staining for stable cell surface expression of CD1d,
compared with isotype control staining, and also compared
with control cells stably transfected with the empty control
vector.
NKT cells
The Va14Ja18þVb8.2þ NKT cell hybridoma cell lines DN32.
D3 and N38-3C3, and the CD1d-speciﬁc NKT cell hybridoma
N37-1A12 (Va5þVb7þ) have all been described (10–12) and
were graciously provided by R.R. Brutkiewicz. A mouse iNKT
hybridoma, 1.2, which coexpresses mouse invariant Va14-Ja18
and Vb8.2 chains, was kindly provided by Dr. Mitchell Kronenberg (La Jolla Institute of Allergy and Immunology, San Diego,
CA). The NKT cells are tested for speciﬁcity to CD1d in each
experiment via functional T assay.

Generation of mouse iNKT cell lines
Mouse iNKT cell lines were generated as described with
some modiﬁcations (14, 15). Thymocytes were cocultured with
autologous immature DCs in the presence of 100 mg/mL

(Accurate Chemical), cells were restimulated with immature
DCs in the presence of 100 mg/mL a-GalCer and 10 mg/mL
mouse IL-2 (Cell Sciences) for 1 week. After 3 cycles of
stimulations, more than 95% of NKT cells were shown to react
with mouse CD1d dimer loaded with a-GalCer by FACS.
Generation of artiﬁcial APC
The preparation of CD1d-Ig–based aAPC was carried out
according to the previously described method (16). The
hCD1d-aAPCs were loaded with lipid antigen and a-GalCer
(5 mg/mL in 1 mL PBS containing 5  107 beads; Axxora,
LLC).
Treatment of cells with tumor-associated ascites
The ascites was cleared of cellular debris by centrifugation as
previously described (17). The APCs were treated with the
clariﬁed supernatants for 4 hours at 37 C, unless otherwise
indicated. The APCs were subsequently washed extensively
with PBS, and cocultured with NKT hybridomas for 20 to 24
hours at 37 C. IL-2 was measured as an indication of NKT cell
activation and was measured by standard sandwich ELISA. For
the conditioned medium from ascites derived cells, 50 mL of
ascites was centrifuged at 1,500 rpm for 5 minutes. The ascites
ﬂuid was removed and the remaining cell pellet was cultured in
50 mL of RPMI supplemented with 2 mmol/L L-glutamine
(BioWhittaker), 10% FBS (HyClone), and ciproﬂoxacin (Serologic Proteins) in a T-175 ﬂask for 4 to 7 days, until the adherent
cells reached conﬂuency, then the cultured supernatant was

3746

harvested, centrifuged to remove cellular debris, and used for
experiments.
Extraction of the polar lipid fraction from the ascites
The polar lipid fraction was isolated from the ascites of
the indicated patients with ovarian cancer. Methanol and
then chloroform were added to give chloroform–methanol–
water (4:8:3), and the samples were extracted by stirring
the mixture at ambient temperature. Insoluble material
was removed by centrifugation, and water was then added
to the supernatant to give chloroform–methanol–water
(4:8:5.6). The resulting phases were separated by centrifugation and the upper polar lipid phase was desalted using a
Sep-Pak C18 cartridge (18). The extracted lipids were analyzed by thin-layer chromatography (TLC; HPTLC Silica Gel
60; Merck) with chloroform–methanol–0.25% aqueous KCl
(60:35:8) as running solvent. Gangliosides were detected
with a resorcinol–HCl Cu2þ reagent. Bovine brain gangliosides were used as standards. The commercially available,
puriﬁed gangliosides used in the NKT cell assays: Gg3Cer,
GM2, GM3, GD3 (Matreya), and GD2 (Calbiochem) were
reconstituted in either methanol or chloroform–methanol as
suggested by the manufacturer.
Determination of serum cytokine concentrations
The serum concentrations of IFN-g, IL-12 p70, and IL-4 were
measured 2, 6, 12, 24, 48, and 72 hours after treatment with
a-GalCer and different concentrations of GD3 by standard
sandwich ELISA as previously described (19).

Staining of human iNKT cells with CD1d-mIgG dimers
One microgram of human or mouse CD1d-mouse IgG
dimer was incubated with 1.4 mg a-GalCer, GD3, or ascites in
50 mL of PBS at 37 C for overnight to load the lipid onto
hCD1d-mIgG dimer and used to stain 2  105 Human iNKT
cells on ice for 30 minutes. Then the cells were washed with
PBS containing 5% FBS twice and incubated with phycoerythrin (PE)-labeled rat anti-mouse IgG1 antibody (A85-1)
and allophycocyanin-labeled anti-human CD3e antibody
(BD Biosciences) on ice for 30 minutes. After washing, the
stained cells were analyzed with FACSCalibur System (BD
Biosciences). Flow cytometric data were analyzed with
FlowJo v8.8 software (Tree Star, Inc.).
Competitive ELISA assay
The assay was conducted as previously described (20).
Brieﬂy, Nunc MaxiSorp ﬂat-bottom 96-well plates (Thermo
Fisher Scientiﬁc) were coated with 100 mL of goat anti-mouse
IgG Fc gamma antibody (Biomedia). The plates were washed
3 times with PBS/Tween and 100 mL of lipid-CD1 dimer
mixture was added to the plates immediately after washing.
The mixture solution was prepared by mixing CD1dimer (5 mg/
mL) and lipids in the presence of biotinyl PE (2 mg/mL) in PBS.
The CD1–biotinyl PE complex was detected with horseradish
peroxidase (HRP)-labeled Avidin (eBioscience). Kd of biotinyl
PE was determined by titrating the amount of biotinyl PE to
reach the maximum binding in the absence of competitors and
applying the following equation to the data; Y ¼ (Bmax  X)/(Kd
þ X). Kd of biotinyl PE and Ki of PE and a-GalCer were

calculated using GraphPad Prism (Ver.4.02; GraphPad Software, Inc.).
Intracellular cytokine staining
Two hours after the injection of lipids, liver mononuclear
cells were isolated (21) and cultured ex vivo in the presence
of GolgiStop (BD Pharmingen) for 4 hours. Cells were
stained with anti-TCRb-FITC, anti-NK1.1-PE, anti-CD45APC-Cy7 (eBioscience), ﬁxed, permeabilized (PermWash,
BD), and stained intracellularly for IFN-g. Dead cells were
excluded (LIVE/DEAD Fixable Violet Dead Cell Stain Kit,
Invitrogen).
Statistical analysis
Data analysis was conducted by Prism software (version 5.02
for Windows; GraphPad). Parametric statistics were used to
analyze differences between experimental groups, when needed. Where multiple groups existed within a single experiment,
multiple between-group comparisons were made by ANOVA
with the Bonferroni posttest. A P value less than 0.05 was
considered signiﬁcant. The error bars in the bar graphs show
the SEM.

Polar lipids present in ascites inhibit NKT cell
recognition of endogenous antigen
Because ascites of patients with ovarian cancer is rich in
gangliosides, we hypothesized that these lipids are responsible
for the inhibition of NKT cell activation. The polar lipid fraction
was extracted from the ascites and found to signiﬁcantly
reduce the ability of the APC to stimulate NKT cells (Figs.
2A and B). In fact, the reduction by the polar lipid fraction was
greater than the inhibition caused by ascites pretreatment.
Analysis of the polar lipid fraction by TLC showed that the
majority of patient samples contained the gangliosides GM3,
GD3 and minor amounts of more complex gangliosides
(Fig. 2C).

(Fig. 3E). To further show that the presence of GD3 in ovarian
cancer–associated ascites was responsible for the loss of NKT
cell activation, we pretreated ascites with a monoclonal Ab
speciﬁc for GD3. The presence of antibodies against GD3
signiﬁcantly blocked the ascites-mediated NKT cell inhibition
(Fig. 3F). Taken together, these data show that GD3 in ovarian
cancer ascites ﬂuid inhibits NKT activation and does not
require further processing for its inhibitory effects.
In vivo treatment with GD3 abrogates a-GalCer–induced
cytokine secretion by NKT cells
To test the effects of GD3 in vivo, we used an in vivo NKT cell
activation model in which a-GalCer injection results in cytokine release by NKT cells. Mice were injected with a-GalCer, in
the presence or absence of different concentrations of GD3.
Blood samples were obtained at various time points, and
serum cytokine levels were assessed. IFN- g production was
detectable at 2 hours, with the peak production at 24 hours
after treatment and returned to baseline by 48 hours (Fig. 4A).
Treatment with GD3 resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of

A 25,000
IFN-γ production (pg/mL)

hybridomas, as measured by the release of IL-2 (Fig. 1A).
Treatment with ascites for 1 hour maximally inhibited
the ability of LCD1dwt to stimulate NKT cells (Fig. 1B).
Conditioned medium from cultured cells isolated from
ascites also inhibited antigen presentation to both canonical (Va14þ, DN32.D3) and noncanonical (Va5þ,
N37-1A12) NKT cell hybridomas (Fig. 1C). These studies
suggest that cells present in the ascites actively produce
substances that abrogate CD1d-mediated activation of
NKT cells. To determine whether incubation with
ascites-treated cells resulted in a permanent functional
defect in NKT cell activation, fresh untreated LCD1dwt
cells were added to NKT cells previously exposed to
ascites-pretreated APCs. Addition of untreated cells activated NKT cells to produce cytokines (data not shown),
showing that stimulation of NKT cells with ascites-treated
LCD1dwt cells did not permanently impair NKT cell
function.

Identiﬁcation of GD3 as an inhibitory lipid in ovarian
cancer ascites
To test which of the observed gangliosides is responsible for
the inhibition associated with ascites, APCs were incubated
with increasing doses of puriﬁed GD3 and the related gangliosides including GT1b and GD2 (Supplementary Fig. S1 for
structures; refs. 22, 23), washed and cocultured with NKT cells
(Fig 3A–C). Only GD3 inhibited CD1d-mediated activation of
NKT cells in a dose-dependent fashion. Other tumor-associated glycolipids, such as GM3 (the biosynthetic precursor of
GD3) and the neutral glycosphingolipid gangliotriaosylceramide (Gg3Cer), have been reported to inhibit canonical NKT
cell activation when used at high concentrations (9, 24). Therefore, we also compared the ability of GD3, GM3, Gg3Cer, and
GM2 to inhibit NKT cells (Fig. 3D). We found that only
incubation with GD3 resulted in a signiﬁcant reduction in
NKT cell activation.
To determine whether the inhibition observed following
pretreatment with GD3 required antigen processing, we used
CD1d-Ig–based aAPC. CD1d-Ig–based aAPC were, loaded with
a-GalCer (16) and the loaded aAPCs were then treated with
control medium, ascites ﬂuid, or puriﬁed gangliosides. Treatment with GD3 completely inhibited a-GalCer presentation by
aAPCs whereas treatment with control medium had only
minimal effects on aAPC-mediated NKT cell activation

GD3 Inhibits CD1d-Mediated NKT Cell Activation

a-GalCer–induced IFN-g production with half-maximal inhibition seen at 0.3 mg GD3. In vivo administration of GD3 also
inhibited IL-4 (Fig. 4B) and IL-12 production by a-GalCer–
stimulated NKT cells, as shown in Fig. 4C.
To determine whether the GD3-mediated inhibition of

the suppression of NKT cell function, we next sought to
determine whether GD3 could inhibit freshly prepared bulk
NKT cells. Liver mononuclear cells were isolated from C57BL/6
wild-type mice and pulsed with antigen or cultured in medium
alone as a control and cytokine production was assessed by
intracellular cytokine staining (Fig. 5A). To conﬁrm whether
reduced serum cytokine levels were indeed due to impaired
production by NKT cells in the presence of GD3, liver mononuclear cells were harvested 2 hours after injection of a-GalCer
and GD3 or the combination of both. Assessment of IFN-g
production by intracellular cytokine staining revealed that

GD3 binds with high afﬁnity to CD1d molecules
To analyze the mechanism of the inhibition, we studied
the binding of GD3 to CD1d molecules using a competitivebinding assay (20). A dose-dependent competition by GD3 to
the tagged lipid 18:1 biotinyl PE was observed for both
human and mouse CD1d molecules (Figs. 6A and B). The
IC50 values (24 nmol/L for hCD1d and 11 nmol/L for mCD1d)
indicate that puriﬁed GD3 binds with signiﬁcantly higher
afﬁnity to CD1d than PE (IC50 > 800 nmol/L, Table 1).
Notably, the apparent afﬁnity of GD3 was higher than that

Figure 6. GD3 competes with PE for binding to CD1d. A and B, Nunc MaxiSorp ﬂat-bottom 96-well plates were coated with goat anti-mouse IgG Fc gamma
antibody and the plates were washed and blocked. Then, the wells were coated with CD1d:IgG1 dimer, after washing, serially diluted lipids were added into the
wells in the presence of 2 mg/mL biotinyl PE. The plates were then washed and the amounts of CD1d:mIgG1–biotinyl PE complex were detected by
adding HRP-labeled Avidin. Comparisons were done among all of the lipids (GD3, 18:1PE, and a-GalCer) and the binding afﬁnity between any 2 lipids is
signiﬁcantly different. C, GD3-loaded CD1d dimeric molecules do not stain NKT cells. Mouse CD1d:Ig dimer was incubated with a-GalCer, ascites, or GD3 to
load the lipid onto the dimer, then used to stain NKT cells. The cells were washed and incubated with PE-labeled rat anti-mouse IgG1 antibody (A85-1). After
washing, the stained cells were analyzed by ﬂow cytometry. Human CD1d:Ig dimer was incubated with a-GalCer, ascites, or GD3 to load the lipid onto the
dimer, then used to stain primary NKT cells. The differences observed in binding between a-GalCer–loaded mouse and human CD1d:Ig dimers may be due to
the use of primary human T cells, rather than NKT cell hybridomas. In all ﬁgures, these data represent 1 of 2 or more experiments with similar results.

of a-GalCer (84 nmol/L for hCD1d and 95 nmol/L for
mCD1d), this could be due to intrinsic differences in the
afﬁnities or differences in solubility. As this assay has been
shown to reﬂect lipid selectivity by CD1 molecules, these
data indicate that GD3 binds strongly to both human and
mouse CD1d molecules.
We next examined whether CD1d-Ig dimers loaded with
GD3 or ascites ﬂuid could bind to NKT cells (Fig. 6C).
Whereas the controls, a-GalCer–loaded human and mouse
CD1d-Ig dimers, bound to NKT cells, CD1d-Ig dimers loaded
with GD3 or ascites did not. These data may explain the
inhibitory effect mediated by ascites treatment. While GD3
binds with high afﬁnity to CD1d molecules, those complexes
do not bind to or activate NKT cells; thus GD3 present in the
ascites may compete with and displace the endogenous

stimulatory ligands for binding to CD1d molecules and
thereby inhibit activation of NKT cells by their natural
stimulatory ligands.

Discussion
Previous studies implicated various roles for speciﬁc T-cell
subsets in ovarian cancer (4–8). Preclinical studies and clinical
trials have shown that immunotherapy can effectively treat
cancer; however, ovarian cancer immunotherapy needs to also
focus on removing negative factors that could inhibit the
immune response to maximize its therapeutic effects. In the
current study, we identiﬁed an inhibitory CD1d-binding ligand
present in ovarian cancer ascites as the ganglioside GD3.
Mechanistically, we found that GD3 inhibited the binding of

GD3 Inhibits CD1d-Mediated NKT Cell Activation

CD1d-Ig dimers loaded with a-GalCer to NKT cells. Furthermore, GD3 bound with an "apparent" high afﬁnity to both
human and mouse CD1d. Finally, in vivo treatment with GD3
inhibited a-GalCer–mediated NKT cell activation. These studies thus identify GD3 as the ﬁrst high afﬁnity, competitive
ligand that inhibits the activation of NKT cells in vitro and
in vivo.
Speciﬁc gangliosides, such as GD3 and GM3, have been
previously suggested to play a role in regulating NKT cell
function. GD3 expression is upregulated on human melanomas
and when mice were immunized with GD3-loaded DC, low
levels of NKT-speciﬁc GD3 response have been observed (25). A
small fraction of the GD3-speciﬁc NKT cells can also crossreact
with GM3. Analysis of the GM3 response showed that it
partially inhibited some of the NKT-speciﬁc GD3 response,
furthermore it had minimal effect on the a-GalCer–induced IL4 response and no effect on a-GalCer–induced IFN-g
responses. In contrast, we did not ﬁnd a GD3-speciﬁc NKT
cell response but rather that spontaneously secreted GD3 was a
natural inhibitor of canonical, as well as noncanonical NKT
cells. The difference between the 2 systems could be the fact
that in the previous work, the goal was to see whether GD3
could serve as a target for immunotherapy and in those
experiments animals were immunized with DC-loaded GD3.
In contrast, we looked at a-GalCer driven NKT cell responses in
vitro and in vivo and found inhibition by GD3. This is consistent
with the potential role of GD3 in the setting of ovarian cancer,
where it could inhibit the endogenous NKT cell response and is
consistent with the ﬁnding that ganglioside secretion is associated with decreased survival rates.
Using a quantitative binding assay, we measured the afﬁnity
of GD3 for CD1d molecules. The afﬁnity of GD3 was high at
84 and 95 nmol/L for human and mouse, respectively. In
contrast most other naturally occurring ligands such as isoglobotrihexosylceramide (iGb3) are thought to be relatively
low afﬁnity ligands for CD1d, as determined by functional
assays. Even glycolipids isolated from foreign pathogenic
bacteria such as Sphingomonas are not as active as a-GalCer
and are thought to be lower afﬁnity ligands (13, 26, 27). The
high afﬁnity of GD3 for human and mouse CD1d may enable it
to displace most NKT activating ligands, making it a uniquely
potent immunomodulatory substance.

The proliferative index and metastatic status of malignant
melanomas, renal cell carcinoma, and head and neck tumors
are correlated with excessive synthesis of GD3 (28, 29).
Although GD3 is expressed at a low level on normal melanocytes and a few other cell types, its highly restricted
expression select tumor type makes it an attractive therapeutic target. In fact, it has been used for passive and active
immunotherapy of melanomas and small-cell lung cancers
(30–32, 33). Our data suggest that therapeutic strategies
targeting GD3 may also be useful for the treatment of
ovarian cancer.
To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst report showing a mechanism by which ovarian cancer–derived ascites inhibits NKT
cell activation. Furthermore, GD3 is the only known endogenous ligand with such a high afﬁnity for CD1d. Therefore, the
presence of GD3 in the ascites, and its impact on the activation
of NKT cells, may be a prognostic factor for ovarian cancer.
While additional work is necessary, these studies indicate that
GD3 may be important for early detection and monitoring of
ovarian cancer.
