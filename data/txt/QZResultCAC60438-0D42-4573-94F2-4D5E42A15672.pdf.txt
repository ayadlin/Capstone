Abstract
Current treatments for liver metastases arising from primary
breast and lung cancers are minimally effective. One reason for
this unfavorable outcome is that liver metastases are poorly
vascularized, limiting the ability to deliver therapeutics from the
systemic circulation to lesions. Seeking to enhance transport of
agents into the tumor microenvironment, we designed a system in
which nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel (nAb-PTX) is loaded into a nanoporous solid multistage nanovector (MSV) to
enable the passage of the drug through the tumor vessel wall and
enhance its interaction with liver macrophages. MSV enablement
increased nAb-PTX efﬁcacy and survival in mouse models of
breast and lung liver metastasis. MSV-nAb-PTX also augmented
the accumulation of paclitaxel and MSV in the liver, speciﬁcally in

macrophages, whereas paclitaxel levels in the blood were
unchanged after administering MSV-nAb-PTX or nAb-PTX. In vitro
studies demonstrated that macrophages treated with MSV-nAbPTX remained viable and were able to internalize, retain, and
release signiﬁcantly higher quantities of paclitaxel compared
with treatment with nAb-PTX. The cytotoxic potency of the
released paclitaxel was also conﬁrmed in tumor cells cultured
with the supernatants of macrophage treated with MSV-nABPTX. Collectively, our ﬁndings showed how redirecting nAbPTX to liver macrophages within the tumor microenvironment
can elicit a greater therapeutic response in patients with metastatic liver cancer, without increasing systemic side effects.

Introduction

isms of drug resistance in cancer therapy. Major roadblocks for drug
transport consist of biophysical barriers, such as tumor-associated
blood ﬂow, vascular permeability, and tumor stroma. Majority of
liver metastases are hypovascular in comparison with surrounding
uninvolved liver. Tumor lesions in the liver frequently appear either
hypoattenuating or isoattenuating on clinical CT scans (7–9). In
our previous study, vascular permeability in the liver metastases
was decreased with respect to primary tumor (10). Thus, systemically injected contrast agent or therapeutics may not be able to
accumulate sufﬁciently in the lesion.
On the other hand, any substance administered intravenously
rapidly encounters the phagocytic cells of the liver called Kupffer
cells (KC). These tissue associated hepatic macrophages represent
approximately 10% to 20% of all the cells in the healthy liver (11),
and higher numbers are present in the close proximity of metastatic loci due to the recruitment of monocytes/macrophages from
bone marrow in response to tumor-associated inﬂammation
(12). The pronounced presence of these phagocytic cells in the
proximity of the liver lesions has been utilized in the clinic for
imaging liver tumors with intravenous injection of super paramagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPION; ref. 13). Solid SPION
particles are intrinsically taken up by the liver macrophages thus
enhancing the T2 contrast around the lesion.
To overcome multiple successive biophysical barriers and carry
therapeutics to the tumor microenvironment more efﬁciently, we
have developed multistage nanovector (MSV) delivery systems
composed of mesoporous silicon particles (14–16). MSV systems
are comprised of several nanocomponents, or stages, which can be
designed on the basis of the desired functionality (17, 18). First
stage porous silicon particles can target various cell populations,

Despite improvements in diagnosis, surgical techniques, general patient care, and systemic therapies, most deaths from cancer
result from the progressive growth of distant metastases. The liver
is one of the dominant metastatic sites for primary gastrointestinal, breast, and lung cancers. Current approaches to treat liver
metastasis include hepatic resection (surgery), transcatheter arterial embolization, systemic chemotherapies, molecular targeted
therapies, immunotherapies, and various combinations (1).
Unfortunately, patients usually do not respond sufﬁciently to
these therapies or develop resistance, limiting 5-year survival rate
to approximately 22% (2–4).
Transport of therapeutics from systemic circulation to the tumor
cells substantially affects their efﬁcacy (5, 6). Nevertheless, poor
transport and tumor uptake have been often neglected as mechan-

such as tumor-associated endothelial cells or macrophages
(17–20). The nanopores of the ﬁrst stage vector are loaded with
the second-stage therapeutic agent/nanoparticles. When MSV
associates with the target cells in the tumor microenvironment,
the second-stage therapeutic nanoparticles/macromolecules are
released into the tumor lesion by time-dependent degradation of
the silicon carrier. Several studies by our group have reported an
increased efﬁciency when MSV approach was utilized for the
therapy of various primary tumors (21–23).
Nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel (nAb-PTX) is a clinically used nanoformulation of paclitaxel designed to overcome
the toxicities associated with the Cremophor-based formulation
of PTX. nAb-PTX is currently approved for the therapy of advanced
breast, lung, and pancreatic tumors. This albumin-bound therapeutic targets an albumin transporter expressed on vascular endothelial cells (24), thereby, activating transport across the tumor
vessel wall and allowing paclitaxel to accumulate in the tumor.
Although nAb-PTX has shown better therapeutic efﬁcacy than
paclitaxel, its clinical efﬁciency in the case of tumor mass in the
liver lesions is marginal (25).
In this study, we aimed at evaluating the therapeutic efﬁcacy of
redirecting nAb-PTX from tumor vessels to the macrophages in the
proximity of the metastatic tumors in the liver by means of MSV
carrier. MSV-nAb-PTX was designed and characterized in vitro and
in vivo studies. In vivo studies in experimental liver metastasis of
breast and lung tumor models show that the proposed approach
signiﬁcantly enhanced therapeutic transport to the liver and
extended the survival of animals as compared with the clinically
used nAb-PTX.

Materials and Methods
Fabrication, characterization of MSV, and loading of nAb-PTX
Discoidal MSV with 1 mm  0.4 mm (d  h) were fabricated in a
microelectronics facility via photolithography and electrochemical etching as previously described (see also Supplementary
Information; ref. 17). The particles were modiﬁed with 3-aminopropyl-triethoxysilane (APTES; refs. 17, 20, 26) and lyophilized
using Freezone Freeze Dry System (Labconco). nAb-PTX (Abraxane, Celgene) particles injectable suspension was loaded to
lyophilized MSV in aliquots, followed by drying under low
pressure system (27). MSV were ﬂuorescently labeled with
DyLight 650 (Abcam) when required (28). Release of FITCalbumin from the MSV was tested in two pHs: 4.5 and 7.4 (for
cell organelles and plasma/buffer) at 37 C and 100 rpm for 1 to 96
hours. 1 N NaOH solution (10% v/v per sample) was added to all
samples prior to the measurements to avoid the loss of ﬂuorescence of FITC-albumin in acidic pH. The standard curves were
plotted on the basis of the FITC-albumin solutions treated in the
same manner (See Supplementary Information).
Cell culture
The 4T1 murine breast cancer cells and 3LL murine lung cancer
cells were obtained from ATCC and used within 20 passages.
The cells were cultured in Minimum Essential Medium (MEM)
supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% penicillin–streptomycin, 1%
GlutaMAX, 1% NEAA, 1% MEM Vitamin, 1% sodium pyruvate at
37 C in a humidiﬁed atmosphere with 5% CO2.
Isolation of mouse abdominal macrophages
Brewer thioglycollate (3 mL, Becton Dickinson) was injected
into mice peritoneum 72 hours prior to cell harvest. The perito-

430 Cancer Res; 76(2) January 15, 2016

neal cavity was then injected with 5 mL PBS containing 3 mmol/L
EDTA, and the ﬂuid was collected and centrifuged to obtain
macrophages. The cells were seeded at approximately 106 cells
per well in 6-well plates with MEM and supplements as listed
above.
Models of breast and lung cancer liver metastasis and primary
breast tumor
Female Balb/c and C57BL/6 mice, 6 to 8 weeks old, were
purchased from Charles River Laboratories. The mice were maintained in animal facilities at Houston Methodist Research Institute approved by the American Association for Accreditation of
Laboratory Animal Care and in accordance with current regulations and standards of the United States Department of Agriculture, Department of Health and Human Services, and NIH
(Bethesda, MD).
To establish experimental liver metastasis, breast cancer 4T1
cells (1  105/100 mL) or lung cancer 3LL cells (3  105 cells/
100 mL) were injected into the spleen of female Balb/c or C57BL/6
mice, respectively (10). The cells injected in the spleen disseminate to the liver through portal vein, producing experimental
liver metastasis (29). To evaluate therapeutic efﬁcacy and survival
of the tumor-bearing mice described, the spleen was resected 10
minutes after the injection of the tumor cells to prevent growth of
primary tumor in the spleen. For determination of MSV tissue
distribution, the spleen was not resected. 4T1 cells were injected
into the mammary fat pad of Balb/c mice to establish orthotopic
murine breast cancer.
All the surgical procedures are approved by the Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee of Houston Methodist Research
Institute under the protocol AUP-0514-0032.
Intravital microscopy analysis
Alexa Fluor 488 40 kDa (green) and Alexa Fluor 538 3 kDa
(red) dextrans (Molecular Probes) were injected intravenously
into the retro-orbital space of the mice immediately before
intravital microscopy (IVM) recording for visualization of
blood ﬂow dynamics (30). Mice were anesthetized with isoﬂurane and mounted on heated microscope stage during IVM
imaging under Nikon A1R multiphoton microscope (Nikon
Inc.). The liver was exposed by a midline incision through the
abdominal wall. The ﬂuorescent images of the tumors and
unaffected (control) liver (n ¼ 12–15) were recorded 0–60
minutes after the injection of the tracers. The images were
processed for evaluation of ﬂuorescent intensities of the tracers
inside and outside the lesions at different times using NISElements Image Processing Software (Nikon). The recorded
ﬂuorescent intensities in the site of interest (in arbitrary units)
were then normalized to the ﬂuorescent intensity in the unaffected liver.
Evaluation of therapeutic efﬁcacy and survival
Seven days after the injection of tumor cells, the mice (n ¼ 5–8)
were randomized into three treatment groups: (i) untreated
control (PBS); (ii) nAb-PTX (75 mg/kg nAb-PTX, equivalent to
7.5 mg/kg paclitaxel); and (iii) MSV-nAb-PTX (75 mg/kg nAbPTX). The therapy was administered three times via intravenous
injections at 5-day interval. Twenty-four hours after the last
treatment, the mice were sacriﬁced, and the livers were excised
and weighed. Livers were either ﬁxed in 4% formalin or embedded
in OCT compound for histologic and immunohistochemical

analysis. Diameter of liver metastases was assessed by light
microscopy analysis of histology slides.
In survival experiments, 4T1 or 3LL liver metastases bearing
mice were continuously treated with the above regiments once in
every ﬁve days (n ¼ 10) until the mice became moribund and were
sacriﬁced.
Immunostaining with Ki67, F4/80 antibody, CD68, and TUNEL
system
Formalin-embedded tissues were sectioned and stained with
hematoxylin and eosin. Frozen sections were ﬁxed with 4%
paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 minutes. For staining of proliferating cells, or macrophage, the sections were incubated with
anti-mouse Ki67 rabbit polyclonal antibody (Abcam), antimouse F4/80 or CD68 rat polyclonal antibody (AbD serotec) at
4 C overnight followed by incubation with corresponding secondary antibody, respectively. TUNEL assay was performed using
TUNEL System (Promega Biosciences, LLC) according to the
manufacturer's protocol. The sections were imaged under laser
scanning confocal microscope (Nikon Inc.), and the images were
analyzed using NIS Elements software. DAPI nuclear stain was
used to deﬁne the number of cells and the border of the tumor
lesions (based on the density of nuclei). Fluorescent images (n ¼
10–12) were captured and processed for regions of interest (ROI)
using NIS elements software. To evaluate the macrophage distribution in various regions of the liver, the relative ﬂuorescent
intensities of F4/80 cells in ROI inside the tumor, tumor periphery
(40–50 mm from the tumor border) and in the unaffected tissue
were measured and normalized to DAPI signals (number of cells).
MSV tissue distribution
MSV biodistribution was assessed as previously described
(17, 31). Brieﬂy, silicon levels were quantitatively measured in
the liver and major organs using inductively coupled plasma
atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES). Tissue extracts were
processed for ICP-AES analysis spiked with Yttrium as an internal
standard and analyzed for silicon contents (250.69, 251.43,
251.61, and 288.158 nm). An aliquot of the MSV suspension
injected was dissolved in 0.1 N NaOH overnight and tested by
ICP-AES to assess the injected dose of silicon. Silicon levels were
calculated as micrograms of silicon per grams of tissue and further
normalized to the injected dose to obtain percentage of injected
dose. For evaluation of MSV distribution in the liver tissue, 4T1
tumor in the liver bearing Balb/c mice were injected intravenously
with ﬂuorescent MSV. The mice were sacriﬁced 24 hours after
injection and the livers were excised, embedded in OCT, and
sectioned.
Cell proliferation assay in vitro
MTT (Sigma) and WST1 (Clonetech) assays were performed
according to the manufacturer's protocols to access viability of
4T1/3LL cells and abdominal macrophages, respectively. Cancer
cells and abdominal macrophages were seeded into 96-well tissue
culture plates at concentrations 1  103 cells/well and 1  104
cells/well, respectively, and incubated with increasing concentrations of nAb-PTX and MSV-nAb-PTX for 72 hours. Cell viability
was assessed at 570 and 440 nm for MTT and WST-1 assays.
Sample preparation for quantiﬁcation of paclitaxel by
LC/MS-MS
Amount of paclitaxel internalized and released by macrophages
was determined in vitro (See Supplementary Information). In

brief, macrophages were incubated with MSV, nAb-PTX, or
MSV-nAb-PTX for 1 and 2 days and the cells were lysed for analysis
of paclitaxel internalization. In addition, the macrophages were
incubated with MSV, nAb-PTX or MSV-nAb-PTX, washed and
further cultured with fresh medium. After 1 and 2 days, the
supernatant was measured for the amount of paclitaxel released.
The amount of paclitaxel in the plasma and liver of mice injected
with PBS, MSV, nAb-PTX, and MSV-nAb-PTX was also determined
after 1 and 3 days of treatment and measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS-MS) analysis (see
Supplementary Information).
To evaluate cytotoxic activity of paclitaxel released from macrophages, conditioned medium was added to cancer cells and cell
death was evaluated by MTT assay after 3 days.
Statistical analysis
All quantitative parameters are presented as a mean with SD.
Statistical analysis was performed by the Mann–Whitney U test
for unpaired samples, and survival analysis was done by the
Kaplan–Meier method and compared by the Log rank test using
the SPSS software. P value of < 0.05 is accepted as indicative of a
signiﬁcant difference.

Results
Transport of macromolecules into the tumor lesions in the liver
Clinically, liver lesions frequently appear hypoattenuated,
pointing towards the low perfusion, extravasation, and diffusion
of the contrast reagents in the tumors as compared with the
uninvolved organ. To conﬁrm that our animal models of liver
metastasis are characterized by similar features, we have performed IVM imaging of intravenously injected 3 kDa and 40 kDa
dextrans in the liver lesions. Figure 1A and B shows that the
transport of both molecules into the loci of liver metastasis was
signiﬁcantly impaired. Quantitatively (Fig. 1B), the intensity of
3 kDa probe in the lesion ranged from 35% to 70% of that of the
unaffected tissue, while for 40 kDa dextran, the concentration in
the unaffected tissue was four times higher than inside the lesion.
nAb-PTX is an albumin-bound drug and albumin has a similar
hydrodynamic diameter as the high molecular weight dextran
(10 nm). We have also conﬁrmed that similar to the clinical
ﬁndings (32), both models show increased number of macrophages in the proximity of the tumor lesions in the liver (Fig. 1C).
The concentration of macrophages on the periphery of the tumor
lesions in the liver was twice higher than in the uninvolved organ
(39.8% vs. 21.7%, P < 0.01, respectively).
Design and characterization of MSV-nAb-PTX
As we have previously shown that MSV particles have high
afﬁnity to macrophages in vitro and in vivo (17, 18, 20), we have
further designed the MSV-nAb-PTX carrier to shift the intrinsic
transport characteristics from albumin transporters involved in
nAb-PTX and located on the blood vessels towards association
with macrophages in the proximity of the lesions in the secondary
liver tumors. The pores of MSV carrier were loaded with nAb-PTX
and FITC-albumin as a model ﬂuorescent molecule with the same
physicochemical characteristics and the release proﬁles in aqueous media of two different pHs (7.4 and 4.5) were assessed
by ﬂuorimetry. The two pHs were chosen to represent the
physiologic pH of the injection solution and the plasma and
the acidic pH of cell endosomes. MSV were efﬁciently loaded
with FITC-albumin and nAb-PTX (Fig. 2). Zeta potential (z) of

nm (Supplementary Fig. S1), comparable with the hydrodynamic diameter of the albumin. Thus, the particles can be
efﬁciently loaded into the pores of MSV with diameters ranging
from 20 to 50 nm. The optimized loading efﬁciency of nAb-PTX
was 64%, which depended on the method of loading, with the
most efﬁcient one being vacuum assisted loading (as described
in Materials and Methods section).
In terms of release, albumin was more prompt to be released
in the normal pH and was not released from the MSV in acidic
environment (Fig. 2C). This points toward the ability of MSV
to protect the drug in the endosomal compartment. Our
previous studies have shown that MSV can be efﬁciently
released from the macrophages and endothelial cells by exoand transcytosis (34).

Therapeutic efﬁcacy: MSV-nAb-PTX versus nAb-PTX
The mice bearing experimental liver metastasis of breast and
lung tumors were treated with MSV-nAb-PTX, nAb-PTX, or PBS
(untreated control), three to four times once every 5 days. The
mice were sacriﬁced and the livers were excised and processed
for evaluation of the size/number of the lesions macroscopically and microscopically, weighted, and processed for evaluation of cancer cell apoptosis and proliferation. Macroscopically, we have conﬁrmed the presence of numerous large
tumor (light) lesions on the liver surface in the untreated
control group (Supplementary Fig. S2). The tumor lesions
appeared smaller in the nAb-PTX group, but the least number
of lesions and the smallest size were observed in the tumorbearing mice treated with MSV-nAb-PTX. Liver weight was
lower in the both models treated with MSV-nAb-PTX as compared with nAb-PTX (Fig. 4A, P < 0.05). It is noteworthy that in
the healthy animals, the liver weights ranged between 0.9 and
1.2 grams, similarly to what was measured for liver metastasis
bearing mice following the therapy with MSV-nAb-PTX.
Furthermore, Fig. 4B shows MSV-nAb-PTX enabled a signiﬁcant
extension of survival of the tumor-bearing mice as compared with
the other two therapies (nAb-PTX vs. MSV- nAb-PTX: P < 0.05 for
4T1 and P < 0.01 for 3LL, n ¼ 10/each group). No changes in the
number of macrophages in the unaffected liver (Fig. 4C) and body
weight of the animals (data not shown) were observed, indicating
both nAb-PTX and MSV-nAb-PTX were not toxic.
Histologic evaluation consequently revealed that the tumor
diameters at microscopic level in breast (4T1 cells) or lung (3LL
cells) liver metastases were signiﬁcantly smaller in the mice
treated with MSV-nAb-PTX as compared with other therapy
groups (Fig. 5A and Supplementary Fig. S3). We further performed an immunohistochemical evaluation of the lesions.
Percentages of Ki67-positive cancer cells in the lesions as a
marker for the cell proliferation and TUNEL-positive cells as a
marker for apoptosis were imaged (Fig. 5B). The number of
Ki67-positive cancer cells (pink) was reduced in MSV-nAb-PTX
group as compared with two other groups. The proliferation

index (% proliferated cells) after MSV-nAb-PTX treatment was
also signiﬁcantly lower than those mice were treated with nAbPTX (P < 0.01 in 4T1 model, P < 0.05 in 3LL model; Fig. 5C). On
the other hand, as shown in Fig. 5D, the number of TUNELpositive cancer cells (green cells) and the apoptosis index were
signiﬁcantly higher in MSV-nAb-PTX–treated group in both
models as compared with the mice treated with nAb-PTX (P
< 0.05 for both models).

Biodistribution of MSV and the nAb-PTX
The organ distribution of MSV and the drug in the models of
experimental liver metastasis was evaluated (Fig. 3). In both mice
bearing breast tumors in the liver and healthy mice, the highest
concentration of MSV among the organs tested was in the liver. In
the animals with liver metastasis, signiﬁcantly higher concentrations of MSV in the liver were assessed as compared with the
healthy mice (36.9% vs. 23.4%, P < 0.01). This can be related to
the increased quantities of macrophages in the affected livers
(Fig. 1C).
Furthermore, to assess the levels of nAb-PTX delivered intravenously in the blood plasma and livers, the mice bearing liver
metastases were injected either with MSV-nAb-PTX, nAb-PTX, or
PBS (untreated control) (Fig. 3B and C). One day after the
administration, paclitaxel concentration in the plasma was not
signiﬁcantly different for nAb-PTX versus MSV-nAb-PTX. On the
other hand, the amount of paclitaxel accumulated in the liver was
three times higher for MSV-nAb-PTX than for nAb-PTX (P < 0.05).
To conﬁrm the localization of the MSV in the liver tissue, we have
immunostained macrophages with CD68 antibody. As shown

4T1 breast and 3LL lung cancer cells growth were in the range
of 0.1 to 0.5 mg/mL. In contrast, macrophages were not sensitive
to the agents and their viability was slightly affected only in the
50 mg/mL concentration range. These in vitro results support the in
vivo ﬁndings that macrophages in the uninvolved liver were not
affected by the therapeutics (Fig. 4C).
We have then examined the capability of macrophages to serve
as a depot for paclitaxel. The amount of paclitaxel internalized
into the macrophages was examined 1 and 2 days after the
incubation of abdominal macrophages with MSV-nAb-PTX or
nAb-PTX in vitro, and determined by LC/MS-MS. The quantities of
paclitaxel accumulated in macrophages treated with MSV-nAbPTX were signiﬁcantly higher than those treated with nAb-PTX
(Fig. 6A).
Next, we have evaluated whether macrophages can release the
internalized drug extracellularly. In this experiment, macrophages
were incubated with media containing control PBS, nAb-PTX, or
MSV-nAb-PTX for one or two days, then media was discarded,
macrophages were washed, and fresh media without therapeutics
was added to culture wells. The amount of paclitaxel released into
the culture wells 24 hours after the incubation was quantiﬁed by
LC/MS-MS. Higher amount of paclitaxel was released from
macrophages into culture media when macrophages were preincubated with MSV-nAb-PTX as compared with nAB-PTX (Fig.

6B). Interestingly, expression of p-glycoprotein, which is associated with efﬂux pumps for various chemotherapeutics including
paclitaxel, was increased in macrophages when incubated with
MSV-nAb-PTX and nAb-PTX as compared with control media
(Fig. 6C and D).
Finally, we determined paclitaxel released from macrophages
preserves the cytotoxic effect on cancer cells. The supernatants
containing the drug released from the macrophages were added to
the cancer cells and assessed for their effect on the tumor cell
proliferation. Figure 6C and D show that the macrophage condition media following the preincubation with MSV-nAb-PTX
were the most efﬁcient to inhibit the growth of 4T1 (Fig. 6E) and
3LL cells (Fig. 6F) respectively, demonstrating that the released
drug is therapeutically active.

Discussion
In this study, we describe a novel approach to increase the
efﬁcacy of currently used large molecular weight/nanoparticle–
based agents for the therapy for liver metastases of breast and
lung cancer. Currently, efﬁcient therapies for tumors metastasizing to the liver are not available and the condition is
frequently considered terminal. nAb-PTX is approved by the
FDA for therapy against advanced breast, non–small cell lung

and pancreatic cancers; however, its clinical efﬁciency against
liver lesions has not been reported. It is the ﬁrst of a new class
of anticancer agents that incorporate albumin-nanoparticle
technology and exploit the unique properties of albumin, a
natural carrier of lipophilic molecules in the mammalian serum
(35). The albumin-bound nanoparticle was designed to target
an albumin-speciﬁc receptor (gp60) expressed on vascular
endothelial cells, thereby activating transport across the tumor
vessel wall, allowing paclitaxel to penetrate the endothelium

www.aacrjournals.org

and reach the tumor cells in higher concentration (35). In
addition, nanotherapeutics including nAb-PTX have an advantage
over free chemotherapeutics because they preferentially accumulate into tumor sites utilizing enhanced permeation and retention
(EPR) effect on tumor (36). Thus, efﬁcacy of nAb-PTX can be
correlated with the levels of angiogenesis in the tumors. In contrast
to the primary tumors, which generally possess angiogenesis and
enhanced blood ﬂow and are characterized by the pronounced
EPR, secondary tumors growing in the liver are not well perfused
with blood and their vascular permeability is limited as conﬁrmed
by our IVM imaging of the tumor-bearing mice (Fig. 1). These
ﬁndings are in agreement with the strong clinical evidence of CT
imaging data of patients with secondary liver tumors, which
appear less perfused when contrast agents are injected intravenously. These biophysical barriers for transport of therapeutics in
the liver metastases diminish the transport advantage of nAb-PTX,
thus alternative strategies to increase the therapeutic efﬁcacy of
this agent is being pursued.
To overcome the barriers and produce higher drug concentrations at the tumor site in the liver, hepatic arterial infusion (HAI)
through catheter has been tested. Phase I clinical study of HAInAb-PTX has shown safety, clinical efﬁcacy, and higher drug
concentration in the liver as compared with nAb-PTX given
intravenously (37). However, the drawbacks of the HAI include
the invasiveness of the procedure, need for an experienced team of
surgeons, radiologists, and medical oncologists as well as possible
complication of implanting the catheter into the major artery
(38). Our results show that by utilizing the interactions of MSV
with the liver macrophages surrounding the tumor lesions, we
could enhance the transport of nAb-PTX into the liver by intravenous injection of therapeutic, which is more feasible, does not
require speciﬁcally trained surgical personnel, and safer as compared with HAI-nAb-PTX. Our approach is sustained by the
observation that higher numbers of macrophages were found to
accumulate in the close proximity of the tumor due to the
recruitment of monocytes/macrophages from the bone marrow,
responding to tumor-related inﬂammatory signals (12). It is well
known that any solid particulate administered intravenously
immediately encounters and internalized by the liver macrophages. On the other hand, albumin-based conjugates do not
possess similar characteristics. Thus, to increase the localization of
the nAb-PTX into the liver metastasis loci by enhancing its
association with macrophages, we utilized MSV systems composed of mesoporous silicon particles (14–16).
The MSV system is comprised of several stages: ﬁrst stage,
mesoporous silicon particles (S1MP), target elements in the
tumor microenvironment, while the second stage nanoparticles
(S2NP, e.g., nAb-PTX) encapsulated in the pores of S1MP are
slowly released in the proximity of the tumor cells and affect
these cells. Redirecting nAb-PTX transport from tumor vessels,
which represent its original target and are not functional in the
secondary liver tumors, to macrophages, which are abundant in
the proximity of breast and lung liver metastasis should
increase transport of therapeutics to tumors in the liver. Previous studies have shown that micrometastasis accumulate
higher quantities of macrophages than more mature tumor
lesions (39, 40), indicating that MSV-nAb-PTX could also be
beneﬁcial to prevent the development of micrometastases into
macrometastasis.
The biodistribution of MSV into the various major organs of
healthy and the tumor-bearing mice after intravenous injection

determined that signiﬁcantly higher quantities of MSV were
localized in the livers of tumor bearing mice as compared with
control healthy animals (36.9 vs. 23.4% of injected dose,
respectively; Fig. 3A). This can be related to the tumor associated inﬂammation and recruitment of the monocytes from
bone marrow to the area surrounding the liver metastasis. We
found preferential accumulation of MSVs in the liver as compared with other organs (e.g., lungs) that also contain resident
macrophages. The difference can be explained by the abundance of macrophages in the liver; macrophages represent
approximately 10% to 20% of all the cells in healthy liver and
80% to 90% of whole tissue body macrophages (11). Liver
macrophages comprise liver capillary wall along with endothe-

lial cells. In contrast, resident macrophages in the other organs
exist outside blood vessels or inside vessels with lesser extent
(41, 42), so injected MSVs have less of a chance to encounter
macrophages in the lungs and spleen as compared with liver
macrophages.
To validate that macrophages serve as a depot for MSVs, we
have previously tested the elimination of macrophages in the liver
using clodronate liposomes (43) to reduce the accumulation of
MSV in the organ. For this purpose, we used mice with primary
breast 4T1 tumor grown in the mammary fat pad with the
hypothesis that elimination of tissue macrophages (including
liver macrophages) could signiﬁcantly shift the biodistribution
of MSVs towards the tumor. However, we observed that

Albumin-Bound Paclitaxel Loaded in Multistage Vector for Liver Mets

clodronate liposomes induced severe and acute toxicity in tumorbearing animals even at the lower dose of the drug. Close to 50%
of the animals were unable to overcome this toxicity and succumbed due to the drug administration. Thus, we concluded that
in cancer-bearing sick animals, macrophages play a protective role
for the overall animal health. Total elimination of the tissue
macrophages can signiﬁcantly jeopardize the well-being of the
animals. The number of survivors was not sufﬁcient for the
statistical analysis, but the results showed a clear trend that
elimination of liver macrophages increased the accumulation in
the primary breast tumor (Supplementary Fig. S5). In addition, we
have performed studies in 3D tumor spheroids using a coculture
of tumor cells and macrophages. These studies show the lack of
macrophages signiﬁcantly hampers the therapeutic efﬁcacy of
MSV-nAb-PTX (manuscript submitted).
We have constructed MSV-nAb-PTX by loading the S1MP
nanopores with nAb-PTX and evaluated the amount of paclitaxel
in the systemic circulation and in the livers of the tumor-bearing
mice using LC/MS-MS. Although the amount of paclitaxel was
signiﬁcantly higher in the liver of mice treated with MSV-nAb-PTX
as compared with that in the mice treated with nAb-PTX, there was
no signiﬁcant difference in the paclitaxel concentration in the
systemic circulation of the two groups of mice. These results
indicate the potential clinical advantage using MSV-nAb-PTX to
increase therapeutic efﬁcacy for the tumors in the liver without
increasing the incidence of systemic side effects. It is important to
note that there was no body weight reduction in the mice treated
with MSV-nAb-PTX as compared with the other groups. This is in
accordance with a clinical study using HAI-nAb-PTX, which has
shown increased concentration of pacliatxel in the liver without
increasing peak concentration in the systemic circulation and the
chance for systemic adverse events (37, 38). The 3-fold higher
concentration of the drug in the affected liver delivered by MSV
also suggests that treatment interval can be extended for MSVnAb-PTX as compared with nAb-PTX to possibly enable similar
therapeutic beneﬁts.
Interestingly, macrophages in the liver were not killed by the
chemotherapeutic agent as conﬁrmed by in vivo and in vitro
studies. The number of macrophages in the uninvolved liver
counted by immunoﬂuorescence imaging of macrophages in
the mice treated with control, nAb-PTX, or MSV-nAb-PTX was
unchanged (Fig. 4C). Macrophages maintained their viability at
high concentrations of paclitaxel, which were more than hundred times higher than those required to kill more than 90% of
4T1 and 3LL cells (Supplementary Fig. S4). One of the reasons
for resistance of macrophages to paclitaxel can be attributed to
increased expression of p-glycoprotein, which is associated
with efﬂux pumps on macrophages when incubated with
paclitaxel (Fig. 6C and D). This is also an important factor in
the ability of macrophages to excrete the accumulated drug to
the tumor microenvironment. Paclitaxel enhances the polymerization of tubulin to stable microtubules and blocks cells
in the G2–M phase of the cell cycle and such cells are unable to
form a normal mitotic apparatus (44). On the other hand,
macrophages are terminally differentiated monocytes, a nondividing cell population (45); therefore, they may not be
affected by paclitaxel.
Since, as earlier discussed, macrophages are engulﬁng MSV, it
was important to determine whether macrophages can internalize
and release the therapeutic agent from MSV in vitro (Fig. 6).
Macrophages internalized and released signiﬁcantly higher quan-

tities of paclitaxel when the cells were cultured with MSV-nAb-PTX
as compared with nAb-PTX. These results indicate advantage of
using MSV as a carrier of nAb-PTX to enhance the transport of the
paclitaxel into the liver tumor microenvironment. In the next set
of experiments, following the incubation of macrophages with
nAb-PTX or MSV-nAb-PTX, the cells were washed and further
incubated with fresh media without therapeutics. The concentration of paclitaxel released from the cells was three times higher
when the cells were preincubated with MSV-nAb-PTX as compared with nAb-PTX. Finally, we conﬁrmed that the released drug
from macrophages maintained its cytotoxicity to the breast and
lung tumor cells in vitro.
To summarize the proposed mechanism of action, the efﬁcacy of
MSV-nAb-PTX as compared with nAb-PTX for the therapy of liver
metastasis of breast and liver cancer can be related to redirecting the
transport of nAb-PTX from tumor vessels towards the macrophages
in the tumor microenvironment, which are abundant in the proximity of the lesions in the liver. We have shown that higher
quantities of nAb-PTX can be transported to the liver when nAbPTX is packed in MSV. MSV-nAb-PTX is internalized by the liver
macrophages accumulating especially in the close proximity of the
metastatic lesions in the liver. Macrophages can retain nAb-PTX,
keep viability and release the drug, possibly through efﬂux pumps.
The increased concentration of the therapeutic agent for the prolonged period of time in the proximity of the liver lesions governs
the diffusion of the agent into the microenvironment, eventually
affects the viability of cancer cells nearby, inhibits tumor cell
proliferation, and induces apoptosis. MSV-nAb-PTX signiﬁcantly
enhanced therapeutic efﬁcacy of nAb-PTX in terms of inhibition of
tumor growth and extension of survival.
The therapeutic efﬁcacy of agents in battling tumors can be
hampered not only by the intrinsic molecular resistance
mechanisms developed in cancer cells but also by the insufﬁcient quantity of the therapeutics transported to cancer cells
from the systemic circulation (5, 6). Transport of therapeutics
in the primary tumors and secondary locations signiﬁcantly
differs and, thus, various elements have to be considered.
Understanding transport differentials in oncology, termed
"transport oncophysics," can provide a novel framework to
improve cancer therapy (46). We have shown that by designing
a solid particle system that will retain nAb-PTX and redirect
transport from tumor vessels to the relevant and abundant
elements in the liver tumor microenvironment (macrophages),
therapeutic efﬁcacy of an agent can be signiﬁcantly improved
without increasing chance of developing systemic side effects.
Our study provides strong rationale for clinical translation of
MSV-nAb-PTX as a novel therapy for liver metastases. Relevant
elements in the tumor microenvironment as a target for
efﬁcient transport of therapeutics can be different by the
location of the secondary lesions (i.e, brain, lung, bone, lymph
nodes, etc.). Although most of the tumors in the liver are
characterized by the increased concentration of the macrophages, there are cases when macrophages are underrepresented in these tumor lesions. In these instances, delivering the
drug with MSV is not expected to provide therapeutic beneﬁt
and the deciding therapeutic modality should be rendered on
the basis of the hemodynamics in the tumors evaluated by the
imaging modalities (CT/MRI with contrast reagent; refs. 6, 47).
Ultimately, personalized cancer therapy should consider the
transport information in the tumor lesions of the speciﬁc
patient.
