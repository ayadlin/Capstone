mRNA Splicing Variants: Exploiting Modularity to Outwit
Cancer Therapy
Scott M. Dehm

Abstract
Systemic cancer therapy has traditionally exploited vulnerabilities in cancer cells, a strategy which has become
more precise with the identiﬁcation and targeting of driver oncogenes. However, persistent tumor growth due to
primary (de novo) or secondary (acquired) resistance limits therapeutic efﬁcacy for many patients. Alternative
splicing is important for increasing the diversity of the cellular proteome, and is a process frequently deregulated
during cancer development and progression. In cancer cells, diverse splicing alterations have been identiﬁed that
eliminate protein domains or enzymatic activities required for efﬁcacy of cancer therapies, promote gain of novel
signaling functions that circumvent cancer therapies, and uncouple signaling pathways from upstream regulatory
points that are blocked by cancer therapies. The mechanisms underlying these splicing changes range from stable
alterations in gene sequence/structure to deregulation of splicing regulatory factors. In this review, the role of
splice variants in cancer therapy resistance will be discussed, with examples of how mechanistic understanding of
these processes has led to the development of novel strategies for therapy resensitization. Cancer Res; 73(17);

mRNA Splicing Variants and Cancer Therapy
Resistance
The spliceosome is composed of small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNP: U1, U2, U4, U5, and U6) and more than
200 polypeptides. This macromolecular complex processes
newly transcribed precursor mRNAs (pre-mRNA) to remove
intronic sequences and join exons, giving rise to mature
mRNAs. Intronic motifs that direct this process are the 50
splice donor site, the 30 splice acceptor site, and the branch
site near the 30 end of the intron, which form base pair
contacts with the small nuclear RNA (snRNA) components of
snRNPs. The U1 and U2 snRNPs recognize the splice donor
and branch sites, respectively, which are key early steps in
intron recognition. The recognition of these introns is regulated by diverse intronic and exonic splicing enhancer (ISE
and ESE) and suppressor (ISS and ESS) elements. Alternative
splicing is a process whereby introns are differentially identiﬁed and removed from pre-mRNAs, allowing multiple
mRNA conﬁgurations of joined exons to arise from a single
gene. This adds diversity to protein architectures and supports biologic complexity. Indeed, most genes express multiple alternatively spliced mRNAs simultaneously, although
one isoform is usually dominant (1). A fundamental characAuthor's Afﬁliation: Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology,

teristic of cancer cells is the deregulation of normal cellular
processes, and deregulation of splicing is no exception. This
has been the topic of excellent reviews focused on deregulation of the spliceosome and splicing plasticity in cancer
cells (2, 3).
Many new targeted therapies have been approved for
clinical use that inhibit speciﬁc deregulated proteins or
pathways, which has increased the precision of systemic
cancer treatment compared with conventional chemotherapy. However, drug resistance is a major factor that limits
effectiveness for both targeted and conventional therapies.
Resistance can manifest as primary resistance, wherein
cancer cells are intrinsically resistant before therapy, or
secondary resistance, wherein resistance develops despite
initial responses. The mechanisms underlying primary and
secondary cancer therapy resistance are complex, including
reduced intracellular drug accumulation, drug inactivation,
alterations in the drug target, alterations in processing of
drug-induced cellular damage, and evasion of apoptosis (4).
Importantly, splicing alterations can be the drivers of therapeutic resistance in cancer cells (5). In some instances,
these resistance-associated splicing alterations are due to
global defects in spliceosome regulation. However, mRNA
splicing in cancer occurs against a backdrop of germline
variability and genomic instability. In these cases, cancer
cells can display stable patterns of "alternative" splicing due
to sequence and/or structural alterations in the normal
gene template. The goals of this review are to highlight
select mechanisms of splicing alterations that underlie
primary and secondary resistance to cancer therapy, and
to assign points in the natural history of cancer development and progression where these splicing alterations can
occur (Fig. 1).

Figure 1. Diverse roles for alternative splicing in primary and secondary resistance to cancer therapy. Models for splice variant association with cancer
therapy resistance and the various points in the natural history of cancer progression where these splice variants have been shown to occur. In cases
of primary resistance, the majority of tumor cells express resistance-associated splice variants or can undergo rapid, acute changes in splicing
dynamics in response to therapy. In cases of secondary resistance, rare cancer cells expressing splice variants that support survival may exist before therapy
or could arise during therapy, ultimately leading to therapy-resistant tumor cell populations. Detailed mechanisms by which the indicated splice
variants can support primary or secondary resistance to therapy and mechanisms underlying their synthesis are discussed in the text.

Primary Resistance Supported by Germline
Splicing Variants
BIM-g and tyrosine kinase inhibitor resistance
The tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) imatinib is the ﬁrst
targeted cancer therapy developed for inhibition of the BCR–
ABL fusion in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). Upregulation of BCL2-like 11 (BIM) is required for induction of
apoptosis by TKIs, and BIM suppression is sufﬁcient for TKI
resistance (6). Multiple BIM splice variants have been
described, one of which is BIM-g, lacking the exon 4-encoded
BH3 domain required for BIM proapoptotic function. Wholegenome sequencing of imatinib-resistant CML samples led to
the identiﬁcation of a recurrent 2,903 bp deletion in intron 2
of the BIM gene (7). This deletion, which favors BIM exon 3

5310

Cancer Res; 73(17) September 1, 2013

splicing over exon 4, is a germline polymorphism occurring in
12.3% of the East Asian population that was found to be
associated with an increased likelihood of CML resistance to
imatinib and second-line TKIs (7). This BIM deletion polymorphism was also found to be associated with decreased
progression-free survival in lung cancer, a disease that can be
treated with the EGF receptor (EGFR) TKI, geﬁtinib (7). On the
basis of its germline origin, this deletion polymorphism would
be expected to drive primary resistance to TKIs. Indeed, cell
line models of CML and non–small cell lung cancer with an
engineered BIM deletion displayed resistance to imatinib and
geﬁtinib, respectively. However, imatinib or geﬁtinib sensitivity could be restored therapeutically in deletion polymorphism-positive CML or lung cancer cells by treatment with a
BH3 mimetic drug (7).

Splice Variants and Cancer Therapy Resistance

Primary Resistance Supported by Oncogenic
Driver Splicing Variants
EGFRvIII and radiation/chemotherapy resistance
Various EGFR splice variants have been described, the most
frequent of which is EGFRvIII, an NH2-terminally truncated
EGFR variant similar to the v-erb-B oncogene (8). EGFRvIII
does not bind any known ligand and displays constitutive,
ligand-independent tyrosine kinase activity (8). EGFRvIII is
expressed in 20%–30% of glioblastoma multiforme, a disease
highly resistant to radio- and chemotherapy. Radiation resistance of glioblastoma multiforme is mediated by EGFRvIII
activation of the catalytic subunit of DNA-dependent protein
kinase (DNA-PKcs), which supports enhanced repair of DNA
double-strand breaks (9). This led to the discovery that EGFRvIII-expressing cells could be resensitized to radiotherapy via
inhibition of DNA-PKcs kinase activity, which delayed DNArepair kinetics (9). Chemoresistance of glioblastoma multiforme has also been linked to EGFRvIII through sustained
activation of mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2; ref. 10). mTORC2 is
activated frequently in glioblastoma multiforme, leading to
activation of NF-kB, and this EGFRvIII-mTORC2-NF-kB pathway was shown to drive resistance to cisplatin, temozolomide,
and etoposide. This led to the discovery that blockade of the
mTORC2 or NF-kB pathways with pharmacologic inhibitors
resensitized glioblastoma multiforme cells to these DNA-damaging agents (10).
In glioblastoma multiforme, expression of EGFRvIII is linked
to complex rearranged and ampliﬁed EGFR gene structures (8).
For example, there is a strong statistical correlation between
EGFR intragenic losses encompassing EGFR exons 2–7 and
expression of EGFRvIII in glioblastoma multiforme (11). Similarly, EGFRvIII is expressed in approximately 10% of lung
squamous cell carcinoma due to underlying intragenic deletions in the EGFR gene, and this is associated with TKI
resistance (12). These studies show that oncogenic EGFRvIII
expression in cancer is a stable phenomenon caused by somatic architectural changes in the EGFR gene, which drives primary radio- and chemoresistance in various human cancers.
Ik6 and imatinib resistance
In BCR–ABL-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL),
primary imatinib resistance has been linked to a loss-offunction Ikaros splicing variant, Ik6. Ikaros is important for
development of lymphocytes and other hematopoietic
lineages. The Ik6 splice variant resulting from skipping of
exons 3–6 of the Ikaros gene (IKZF1) lacks all NH2-terminal
zinc ﬁnger DNA-binding motifs and displays localization to
the cytoplasm as opposed to the nucleus (13). Mechanistically, Ik6 synthesis is due to intragenic deletions of IKZF1
exons 3–6, which appears to be a driver event during lymphoid blast crisis when CML progresses to ALL (14). In a
cohort of 47 BCR–ABL-positive ALL patients, Ik6 expression
was detected in 43 patients, and in 23 of these cases Ik6 was
the predominant isoform (13). The level of Ik6 expression in
these clinical specimens was proportional to the percentage
of blast cells, indicating that Ik6 expression is restricted to the
blast cell population. Importantly, ectopic expression of Ik6

www.aacrjournals.org

in a BCR–ABL-positive ALL cell line was sufﬁcient to drive
resistance to imatinib (13).
AIMP2-DX2 and doxorubicin resistance
Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase-interacting multifunctional
protein 2 (AIMP2) is a haploinsufﬁcient tumor suppressor
gene important for controlling cell fate. A splice variant of
AIMP2 lacking exon 2, termed AIMP2-DX2, occurs in lung, and
perhaps other cancers (15). Following treatment with etoposide or doxorubicin, wild-type AIMP2 mediates the apoptotic
DNA damage response by binding p53 and preventing Mdm2mediated degradation. The AIMP2-DX2 splice variant also
binds p53 but does not inhibit Mdm2-mediated degradation.
AIMP2-DX2 expression in lung cancer specimens is associated
with lung cancer stage and shorter overall survival (15). In a
carcinogen-induced mutation model, normal lung cells surviving carcinogen treatment showed increased expression of
AIMP2 DX2, concomitant with several mutations in the AIMP2
gene. In a minigene reporter assay, modeling one of the
mutations in AIMP2 exon 2 showed that this mutation disrupted binding of the spliceosome assembly factor serine/
arginine rich splicing factor (SRSF)1 to an exon 2 ESE, leading
to exon 2 skipping (15). These ﬁndings implicate a role for
AIMP2 exon 2 ESE mutations and AIMP2 DX2 expression in
oncogenesis as well as primary resistance to chemotherapy in
lung cancer, which is consistent with p53 suppressive function.

Secondary Resistance Supported by Stable
Changes in Splice Variant Expression
FPGS splicing alterations and antifolate resistance
Upon cellular uptake, folates and antifolates such as methotrexate undergo FPGS-mediated polyglutamylation, which
prevents cellular efﬂux. In methotrexate-resistant ALL cell
lines and clinical ALL specimens, diverse FPGS splicing aberrations occur, including intron retention and exon exclusion
(16). FPGS splicing defects did not occur in methotrexatesensitive parental lines, indicating that these events support
secondary resistance. Indeed, an FPGS splice variant resulting
from exon 10 skipping was unable to support FPGS activity in
stably transfected cells (16). Interestingly, altered FPGS splicing in methotrexate-resistant ALL cell lines was associated
with altered splicing patterns for various additional genes,
indicating a stable, global defect in splicing regulation. It will be
important for future studies to identify component(s) of the
spliceosome that may be responsible for these global splicing
alterations in methotrexate-resistant ALL, as this may reveal
opportunities for restoring therapeutic sensitivity.
Truncated androgen receptor variants and castration
resistance
The androgen receptor (AR) is a steroid receptor transcription factor and lineage-survival gene in cells of prostatic origin.
Because of its lineage-survival role, AR is a central therapeutic
target in advanced prostate cancer. Multiple AR splice variants
have been identiﬁed in castration-resistant prostate cancer cell
lines, xenografts, and transgenic mouse models (17). These
splice variants arise through cryptic exon inclusion or exon

skipping, ultimately leading to the synthesis of truncated AR
variant proteins lacking the ligand-binding domain (LBD),
which is the protein domain through which AR activity is
targeted in prostate cancer (17). In various functional experiments, truncated AR variants have been shown to translocate
to the nucleus and drive constitutive, ligand-independent
activation of the AR transcriptional program in a manner
insensitive to antiandrogens (18, 19). In castration-resistant
prostate cancer cell lines and tissues, intragenic rearrangements in the AR gene have been shown to underlie high-level
expression of truncated AR variants (19–21). Moreover, in a
cell-based model of prostate cancer progression, emergence of
castration-resistant cells under conditions of AR-targeted
therapy is associated with enrichment of cells harboring AR
gene rearrangements and high-level expression of truncated
AR variants (20). These studies indicate that AR gene rearrangements can drive secondary resistance to AR-targeted therapy
by supporting expression of constitutively active truncated AR
variants lacking the AR LBD.
Truncated V600E BRAF splice variants and vemurafenib
resistance
Oncogenic V600E BRAF mutations are frequent in melanoma and serve as the molecular target for the V600E BRAF
kinase inhibitor, vemuraﬁnib. Vemuraﬁnib inhibits constitutively active V600E BRAF monomers but paradoxically activates wild-type BRAF dimers, which require active Ras signaling for dimerization and activation. In many vemuraﬁnibresistant melanoma cell lines as well as tissue from patients
displaying vemuraﬁnib resistance, a V600E BRAF splice variant
is expressed, which results from skipping of BRAF exons 4–8
(22). BRAF exons 4–8 encode the Ras-binding domain, and
deletion of this domain allows the shorter splice variant of
V600E BRAF to undergo constitutive dimerization in a Rasindependent manner. Despite vemuraﬁnib binding to this
truncated BRAF V600E splice variant, downstream activation
of ERK persists (22), showing that this is an important driver of
BRAF V600E reactivation and secondary resistance to vemuraﬁnib in melanoma. The mechanism for synthesis of this
truncated BRAF variant is not clear, but skipping of exons
4–8 is restricted to mRNAs harboring the V600E mutation (22).
This implies a mechanism of allele-speciﬁc alternative splicing
or underlying genomic alterations involving the BRAF allele
harboring the V600E mutation.
Survivin 2B and taxane resistance
Increased survivin expression has been observed in taxaneresistant ovarian cancer. The survivin (BIRC-5) gene encodes
ﬁve alternatively spliced isoforms. The development of isoform-speciﬁc reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) primer sets
led to the ﬁnding that the survivin 2B isoform is responsible for
most of the increase in total survivin expression in isogenic sets
of taxane-resistant versus taxane-sensitive ovarian cancer cell
lines (23), indicating that survivin 2B mediates secondary
resistance to taxanes. Consistent with this ﬁnding, isoformspeciﬁc siRNA-mediated knockdown of survivin 2B increased
apoptosis, inhibited cell-cycle progression, and sensitizedresistant ovarian cancer cell lines to docetaxel (23). This

5312

Cancer Res; 73(17) September 1, 2013

mechanistic ﬁnding was translated to a preclinical subcutaneous model of ovarian cancer, wherein liposome nanoparticles were used for systemic delivery of survivin 2B-targeted
siRNA, resulting in reduced tumor growth and enhanced
docetaxel sensitivity in vivo (23).

Resistance Supported by Plasticity in Splice
Variant Expression
MNK2b and gemcitabine resistance
The mitogen-activated protein kinase interacting kinase-2
(MNK2) gene gives rise to two splice variants differing only in
composition of their COOH-termini due to alternative splicing
of exon 13a (MNK2a isoform) or exon 13b (MNK2b). Exon 13a,
but not Exon 13b, encodes a mitogen-activated protein kinase
(MAPK)-interacting domain. Therefore, the MNK2b splice
isoform does not harbor a MAPK-interacting domain and
displays constitutive, MAPK-independent kinase activity
(24). Gemcitabine is one of the main treatment modalities for
advanced pancreatic cancer, but primary resistance occurs
frequently. Pancreatic cancer tissues display high levels of
S209 phosphorylation of eIF4E, the core component of the
translation initiation complex, and levels of eIF4E S209 phosphorylation are associated with worse overall survival (25). In
pancreatic cancer cell lines, eIF4E S209 phosphorylation
increases acutely in response to gemcitabine, cisplatin, and
rapamycin, and these effects persist during treatment. In
addition to increased eIF4E S209 phosphorylation, gemcitabine treatment also results in acute changes in MNK2 splicing
favoring production of MNK2b (25). This plasticity in splicing
favoring MNK2b was shown to be due to gemcitabine-mediated induction of SRSF1. Interestingly, although both MNK2a
and MNK2b can mediate S209 phosphorylation of eIF4E, only
MNK2a requires activation by upstream MAPK signaling.
Indeed, ectopic expression of MNK2b but not MNK2a could
drive gemcitabine resistance in pancreatic cancer cell lines.
Importantly, an MNK chemical inhibitor or siRNA directed to
MNK2 resensitized pancreatic cancer cells to gemcitabine.
This effect was likely mediated through the MNK2b splice
variant, as knockdown of SRSF1 led to an increased MNK2a:2b
ratio, reduced eIF4E phosphorylation, and gemcitabine resensitization (25).
Expression plasticity of BIM-g in breast cancer
SRSF1 has also been implicated in plasticity in BIM splicing
in breast cancer, which highlights an additional mechanism
for increased expression of the BIM-g splice variant. In a model
of breast cancer induced by overexpression of SRSF1, synthesis
of the BIM-g was observed (26). Overexpression of BIM-g was
able to drive increased acinar size and decreased apoptosis in
mammary epithelial cells, indicating it may play an active
oncogenic role (26). This contrasts with functional analysis of
BIM-g in CML harboring an underlying BIM deletion polymorphism, which indicated that this was a loss-of-function splice
variant (7). More broadly, SRSF1 overexpression has been
observed in various human cancers, and SRSF1 overexpression
by itself is transforming in various cell types (26, 27). This
indicates that SRSF1 may play a more global role in supporting

Splice Variants and Cancer Therapy Resistance

splicing plasticity and therapeutic resistance in cancer cells,
which can be manifest in part through expression of BIM-g and
MNK2b splice variants.
Expression plasticity of truncated AR variants in
prostate cancer
Plasticity in AR splicing has also been observed in prostate
cancer, with expression of truncated AR variants lacking the
AR LBD displaying acute expression increases in response to
castration or treatment with enzalutamide, a next-generation
AR antagonist (18). This indicates that another mechanism
exists in addition to AR gene rearrangements as a basis for
truncated AR variant expression. Interestingly, these acute
increases in truncated AR variant expression were accompanied by increased expression of several genes involved in
mitotic progression, indicating that truncated AR variants
support a novel transcriptome that maintains prostate cancer
cell mitosis during AR-targeted therapy (18).

Opportunities for Development of New Therapies
Several of the above examples have illustrated that mechanistic understanding of splice variants and their role in
therapeutic resistance can lead to novel treatment ideas
(e.g., BH3 mimetics to enhance TKI sensitivity in BIM-g driven
cancers, TKIs to increase radiation sensitivity in EGFRvIIIdriven glioblastoma multiforme, nanoparticle delivery of
siRNAs to selectively target the survivin 2B splice variant in
ovarian cancer). However, all of these strategies are based on
inhibiting expression of splice variants or targeting pathways
downstream of splice variant expression. More recently, strategies have been developed to target the splicesosome in cancer
cells directly. For example, knockdown of SRSF1 can restore
therapeutic sensitivity in cancers in which resistance is driven
by MNK2b or BIM-g (25, 26). Similarly, short hairpin RNA–
mediated knockdown of serine–arginine protein kinase
(SRPK)-1, a kinase that phosphorylates SR domains in SRSF1
and other SR splicing factor proteins, leads to increased
sensitivity of pancreas, breast, and colon cancer cell lines to
gemcitabine and cisplatin (28). There are also several antitumor drugs, such as spliceostatin A and pladienolides, that

target the splicing factor 3B (SF3B) component of the spliceosome U2 snRNP, and these are being tested in clinical trials
(29). These SF3B inhibitors may be particularly useful in
hematologic neoplasms, where recurrent mutations in SF3B1
have been reported (29). In addition, oligonucleotide-directed
splice-switching strategies have been developed to correct
RNA missplicing or to prevent mutated exons from being
incorporated into mature mRNAs (30). This splice-modulating
technology may be another approach to restoring or enhancing
therapeutic responses in cancer cells in which splice variants
are drivers of resistance.

Conclusions and Future Directions
The vignettes discussed in this review have shown that the
mechanisms leading to functional expression of alternatively
spliced protein variants are diverse, ranging from germline or
somatic alterations in gene sequence/structure to deregulation of splicing regulatory factors. To obtain a more complete
view of the contribution of these various mechanisms to
splicing alterations, it will be important to design integrative
analyses of genome sequence/structure and splicing patterns
in therapy-resistant tissues. This knowledge is expected to
reveal instances where there is plasticity in splicing-associated
resistance mechanisms, or instances where these splicing
alterations are stable. This may be important for designing
optimal therapeutic resensitization strategies, which could
include modulating the expression and/or activity of the
splicing machinery, direct targeting of splice variant expression, or targeting downstream signaling pathways that are
required for splice variants to drive therapeutic resistance.
