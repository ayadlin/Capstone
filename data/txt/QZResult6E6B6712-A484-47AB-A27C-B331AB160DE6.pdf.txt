SUMMARY

Author Manuscript

Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) is upregulated in a subset of human breast
cancers. However, the cancer cells often quickly develop an adaptive response to HER2 kinase
inhibitors. We found that an epigenetic pathway involving MLL2 is crucial for growth of HER2+
cells and MLL2 reduces sensitivity of the cancer cells to a HER2 inhibitor, Lapatinib. Lapatinibinduced FOXO transcription factors, normally tumor-suppressing, paradoxically upregulate c-Myc
epigenetically, in concert with a cascade of MLL2-associating epigenetic regulators, to dampen
sensitivity of the cancer cells to Lapatinib. An epigenetic inhibitor suppressing c-Myc synergizes
with Lapatinib to suppress cancer growth in vivo, partly by repressing the FOXO/c-Myc axis,
unraveling an epigenetically regulated FOXO/c-Myc axis as a potential target to improve therapy.

INTRODUCTION

Author Manuscript

The gene for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2 or ERBB2) is often
amplified or over-expressed in a subgroup of breast cancers and is associated with poor
prognosis (Slamon et al., 1987). The HER2/EGFR (Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor)
complex can activate a downstream cascade of protein kinases including PI3K and AKT,
promoting tumorigenesis by increasing cell proliferation and survival (Schlessinger, 2000).

small molecule HER2 tyrosine kinase inhibitor Lapatinib (Tykerb) are approved for treating
HER2-overexpressing breast cancer (Molina et al., 2001; Wood et al., 2004). While
Trastuzumab resistance is associated with increased signaling from the insulin-like growth
factor-I receptor (IGF-IR) or a PTEN mutation (Lu et al., 2001; Nagata et al., 2004),
Lapatinib exerts its antitumor activity in a PTEN-independent manner (Xia et al., 2007), and
thus remains useful for treating certain patients with resistance to Herceptin. Adaptive
response to Lapatinib or PI3K/AKT inhibitor can develop via several means including
increased estrogen receptor signaling and upregulation of pro-survival factors and receptor
tyrosine kinases (such as HER3 and IGF-1R) (Chandarlapaty et al., 2011; Garrett et al.,
2011; Muranen et al., 2011; Xia et al., 2006). However, precise mechanisms underlying the
epigenetic response to Lapatinib in terms of controlling sensitivity or resistance are poorly
understood. As such, understanding whether/how sensitivity to Lapatinib is epigenetically or
transcriptionally controlled in HER2+ cancer, and developing more effective treatment
modalities based on these mechanisms are highly desirable.

The HER2 pathway can activate various downstream effectors including PI3K and AKT,
which phosphorylates FOXO transcription factors and results in their subsequent
sequestration in the cytoplasm, suppressing their transcriptional activity (Greer and Brunet,
2005). FOXOs are known as tumor suppressors as they upregulate cyclin dependent kinase
inhibitors (CDKIs) p21Cip1 and p27Kip1 and pro-apoptotic proteins like Bim (Eijkelenboom
and Burgering, 2013; Greer and Brunet, 2005). Inhibiting the kinase activity of HER2 or
PI3K/AKT by cognate kinase inhibitors leads to reduction in phosphorylation of FOXOs,
and thus triggers their translocation into the nucleus and up-regulates transcription of their
target genes (Gilley et al., 2003). An early response to treatment of breast cancer cells with
PI3K/AKT inhibitors or Lapatinib is enhanced translocation of FOXOs into the nucleus,
leading to up-regulation of several receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and resistance to the
inhibitors (Chandarlapaty et al., 2011; Garrett et al., 2011; Muranen et al., 2011).

Targeting epigenetically-regulated pathways in cancer cells is a rapidly emerging approach
for therapy (Yoo and Jones, 2006). Epigenetic landscapes are commonly altered in cancer
cells, and the promise of therapeutically targeting such pathways in breast cancers has been
limited due to a poor understanding of the epigenetic regulatory mechanisms in response to
the HER2/AKT inhibitors. Mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) proteins contain a highly
conserved SET domain that catalyzes histone 3 lysine 4 (H3K4) trimethylation (Krivtsov
and Armstrong, 2007), which is involved in the up-regulation of gene transcription (Gu et
al., 1992). In humans, there are several proteins in the MLL family such as MLL (KMT2A),
MLL2 (KMT2D), MLL3 (KMT2C), and MLL4 (KMT2B), and MLL and MLL2 associate
with co-factors WDR5, RBBP5 and ASH2L. However, it is unclear whether any member of
the MLL family is involved in regulating sensitivity to HER2 inhibitors. Thus it is important
to investigate whether epigenetic regulation cross-talks with the HER2/AKT pathway to
regulate breast cancer cell signaling and sensitivity to HER2/AKT inhibitors. In our current
study, we investigated the potential crosstalk between epigenetic pathways and the
sensitivity to Lapatinib in HER2+ breast cancers.

RESULTS
shRNA-based screening identified multiple components in MLL complexes that are crucial
for growth of BT474 breast cancer cells

Author Manuscript

To determine the potential impact of the epigenetic modulators on regulating sensitivity/
resistance of HER2+ breast cancer cells to targeted drugs, we chose a two-tier approach—
first identifying the epigenetic regulators that are crucial for cancer cell growth, followed by
examining the potential role of the identified epigenetic modulators in regulating sensitivity
to a HER2-inhibition drug such as Lapatinib. To this end, first we assembled an shRNA
library targeting epigenetic regulators including multiple histone methyl- or acetyltransferases. Four to six distinct shRNAs targeting each gene product were packaged in
recombinant lentiviruses and were transduced into HER2+ BT474 cells in 96 well plates
(Figure 1A). We monitored growth of the resulting puromycin-resistant cells and found that
knockdown of multiple epigenetic regulators led to reduced growth of the BT474 cells
(Table S1). Notably, knocking down various components of the MLL (MLL and MLL2
share multiple components, or COMPASS), including WDR5, ASH2L, and RBBP5 (Issaeva
et al., 2007; Smith et al., 2011), decreased the growth of BT474 cells (Figure 1B). In
contrast, shRNAs targeting MLL3 and MLL4, two homologous methyltransferases (Figure
S1A), failed to repress cell growth in either the original screen or in verified knockdown
experiments (Table S1 and data not shown).

Author Manuscript

We further verified the impact of knockdown of MLL, MLL2 and their co-factors on cell
growth through dedicated shRNA experiments. To do this, we transduced control or MLL or
MLL2 shRNA-expressing recombinant viruses to BT474 cells, and found that knockdown
of either MLL or MLL2 reduced the cell growth (Figure 1C-D). We also knocked down
other components of MLL2 complex including WDR5 and ASH2L, and BPTF, a reader of
H3K4 trimethylated by MLLs, as well as histone acetyltransferase GCN5, and found that
their knockdown resulted in reduction of cell number (Figure S1B). These results suggest
that MLL and MLL2 and their related factors play an important role in growth of HER2 +
BT474 cells.
MLL and MLL2 regulate distinct sets of genes in HER2+ breast cancer cells

Author Manuscript

Recent work indicates that Bcl2 family proteins play a crucial role in tumorigenesis and
chemoresistance of breast cancer cells and c-Myc is important in regulating survival and
proliferation of breast cancer cells (Dawson et al., 2010; Lang et al., 2011; Liao and
Dickson, 2000; Vaillant et al., 2013). As such we determined whether MLL and MLL2 are
crucial for their expression. We found that shRNA-mediated knockdown of MLL decreased
the expression of Bclxl but not Bcl2 or c-Myc (Figure 1E). In contrast, MLL2 knockdown
had no effect on Bclxl expression, but decreased the expression of Bcl2 and c-Myc (Figure
1F). Collectively, these results indicate that MLL2, but not MLL, is crucial for expression of
c-Myc and Bcl2 in the BT474 breast cancer cells.

HER2 inhibitor induces expression of c-Myc and maintains the HER2+ breast cancer cells
at a steady state

Author Manuscript

Activation of Ras/HER2/PI3K signaling pathways alters the expression of c-Myc via
affecting transcription, mRNA translation, and protein stability (Galmozzi et al., 2004; Sears
et al., 2000; Zhu et al., 2008). Bcl2 is also upregulated in the HER2+ breast cancer cells
treated with Lapatinib (Xia et al., 2006), but the impact of Lapatinib on c-Myc was not
determined. We sought to determine whether MLL2-regulated c-Myc is influenced by the
highly activated HER2 signaling pathway, before we set out to understand MLL2-mediated
regulation of c-Myc expression. We found that Lapatinib induced Bcl2 mRNA levels in
BT474 cells as expected (Figure 2A-B). Notably, Lapatinib also increased mRNA level of cMyc (Figure 2A). FOXO transcription factors are phosphorylated by AKT and inhibition of
AKT-mediated phosphorylation of FOXOs activates FOXOs by increasing their localization
in the nucleus. We found that Lapatinib treatment increased c-Myc mRNA and FOXO1
mRNA after 8 hr of treatment, an effect lasting for several days on daily treatment (Figure
S2A-C).
Lapatinib treatment decreased c-Myc protein level on day 1 of treatment (data not shown).
However, daily treatment gradually increased the protein level of c-Myc (Figure 2B), and
consistently, reduced phosphorylation of AKT and increased protein level of HER3 (Figure
2B), a protein known to be up-regulated by Lapatinib (Chandarlapaty et al., 2011; Garrett et
al., 2011; Lu et al., 2001). But Lapatinib increased expression of a pro-apototic protein, Bim
(Figure 2B). Moreover, Lapatinib also reduced phosphorylation of FOXO1 (Figure 2B),
whose phosphorylation by active AKT leads its sequestration in the cytoplasm and
inactivation (Gilley et al., 2003), but increased the total FOXO1 (Figure 2B).

Author Manuscript

If Lapatinib induces c-Myc expression via suppressing AKT-mediated FOXO
phosphorylation, then, treating BT474 cells with an AKT inhibitor should also lead to
increased expression of c-Myc. Indeed, treatment of BT474 cells with an AKT inhibitor,
MK2206 (referred to as AKTi hereafter), increased the level of c-Myc at RNA and protein
level, but reduced phosphorylation of AKT and FOXO1 (Figure S2D and data not shown).
Altogether, these results suggest that Lapatinib and AKTi led to suppression of the HER2/
PI3K/AKT pathway, reducing AKT activity and consequently up-regulating c-Myc and
FOXO1.

Author Manuscript

We found that the cell death occurred rapidly after Lapatinib treatment for the first three
days and thereafter the number of the dead cells decreased (Figure 2C). However, while
control cells continued to grow, even at day 6 following the treatment, Lapatinib did not
substantially reduce the number of the viable cells as compared to the cell number at the
start of the Lapatinib treatment (Figure 2D). Rather, during this period, Lapatinib led to an
overall steady state in viable cell number. Careful monitoring of cell cycle showed that
Lapatinib reduced BrdU uptake at S-phase of the cancer cells from 18.8% of cells to 2.32%,
a lower yet still detectable level (Figure S2E). These findings suggest that Lapatinib-treated
cells reached equilibrium of cell division and death, displaying loss of sensitivity or
resistance to treatment by Lapatinib.

AKT inhibitor induces c-Myc expression in breast cancer cells with enhanced PI3K/AKT
signaling
The observation that Lapatinib induces c-Myc is paradoxical because inhibition of a key
tumor-driving HER2/AKT pathway induces a potent oncogene c-Myc, and c-Myc
expression is usually inversely related to cell growth (Spencer and Groudine, 1991). Thus,
we further explored whether Lapatinib or AKTi-induced c-Myc expression we observed is
unique to BT474 cells or also applies to other HER2/PI3K-activated breast cancer cell lines.
Many HER2+ breast cancer cell lines also harbor constitutively active mutations in PIK3CA
that encodes a downstream effector of HER2 signaling, perhaps further increasing the
strength of HER2 signaling.

Author Manuscript

When PI3K is hyper-activated or constitutively activated due to an active mutation,
Lapatinib is no longer able to inhibit PI3K/AKT signaling, as constitutively activated PI3K
can activate downstream targets (including AKTs) regardless of the active status of HER2
(Eichhorn et al., 2008). However, the inhibitor of AKTs should remain capable of inducing
c-Myc expression.
Indeed, treatment of MDA-MB-361 cells, which harbor PIK3CA E545K mutation, with
AKTi, but not Lapatinib (data not shown), induced expression of c-Myc (Figure 2E-F).
Moreover, AKTi inhibited phosphorylation of AKT and FOXO1 precisely as Lapatinib
inhibited this in BT474 cells (Figure S2D). Consistently, treatment of MCF-HER2 cells with
AKTi also led to induction of c-MYC expression (Figure S2F-G).

Author Manuscript

To extend our findings to an even greater number of cell lines, we examined whether
Lapatinib influences expression of c-Myc in another HER2+ (amplified) human breast cell
line, UACC812 (Wang et al.). We found that Lapatinib also increased expression of c-Myc
mRNA and protein levels in UACC812 cells (Figure S2H-I). Collectively, these results
indicate that inhibition of the HER2/AKT pathway in multiple breast cancer cell lines
induces expression of c-Myc. As Lapatinib is approved for treating breast cancer, we
focused on examining the impact of Lapatinib on HER2+ cancer cells.
Lapatinib-induced c-Myc expression is critical for reducing sensitivity of breast cancer
cells to Lapatinib

Author Manuscript

To determine whether Lapatinib-induced c-Myc is crucial for reducing sensitivity to
Lapatinib, or is simply a biomarker responsive to the inhibition of the HER2/AKT pathway,
we transduced a Doxycycline-inducible c-Myc shRNA into BT474 cells. Western blotting
showed that in control cells Doxycycline led to effective knockdown of c-Myc (Figure 3A,
lane 2), but did not affect cell growth (Figure 3B, column 2). Notably, Doxycycline-induced
knockdown of c-Myc precluded full c-Myc induction by Lapatinib at 25 nM concentration
(Figure 3A, lane 4), and significantly reduced cell number (Figure 3B, column 4).
Consistently, increasing the concentration of Lapatinib to 50 nM reduced cell number
compared to control (Figure 3B), and notably Doxycycline-induced c-Myc knockdown even
further reduced cell growth (Figure 3B, column 6). Together, these results indicate that
inducible c-Myc knockdown synergized with Lapatinib to suppress the growth of cancer
cells, increasing sensitivity to Lapatinib.

BRD4 is a chromatin-associating protein that can bind acetylated histones via its BET
domain to upregulate gene transcription (Dey et al., 2003), and recently developed BRD4
inhibitors suppress leukemia and sarcoma partly by suppressing c-Myc expression (Dawson
et al., 2011; Filippakopoulos et al., 2010). We found that IBET151 (IBET hereafter), a small
molecule inhibitor of BRD4, abolished Lapatinib-induced up-regulation of c-Myc mRNA in
BT474 cells (Figure 3C). Similar results were also observed in MDA-MB-361 cells after cotreatment with AKTi and IBET (Figure S3A). Consistently, Western blotting showed that
IBET almost abolished Lapatinib-induced expression of c-Myc at the protein level (Figure
3D). Moreover, IBET also reduced Lapatinib-induced Bcl2 expression and increased PARP
cleavage, an indicator of apoptosis, but had little effect on expression of Bim (Figure 3D).
Consistently, IBET synergized with Lapatinib to suppress the breast cancer cells (Figure
S3B).

Author Manuscript

As Lapatinib-mediated inhibition of HER2 represses a cascade of downstream protein
kinases including PI3K and AKT, which phosphorylates and thus inhibits FOXO
transcription factors by excluding their nuclear distribution (van der Horst and Burgering,
2007), we examined whether IBET has an impact on expression of FOXO1 and its cellular
distribution in BT474 cells. As expected, Lapatinib increased localization of FOXO1 in the
nucleus, the active fraction of FOXO1. However, IBET treatment did not change the
expression or cellular distribution of FOXO1 (Fig S3C).

Author Manuscript

We ectopically expressed c-Myc in BT474 cells, and then determined whether ectopically
expressed c-Myc reduces sensitivity to Lapatinib. Western blot showed that transduction of
the cells with the c-Myc-expressing recombinant viruses moderately expressed c-Myc
(Figure 3E). Lapatinib-induced c-Myc expression, consistently, was completely blocked by
IBET in vector-transduced control cells (Figure 3F, lane 2), and correlated well with
reduction of cell growth (Figure 3G, column 2). Notably, IBET failed to completely
suppress c-Myc expression in the cells ectopically transduced with c-Myc (Figure 3F, lane 4
vs 2), likely because the viral promoter-driven expression of the ectopic c-Myc was
independent of BRD4. In agreement, the IBET-resistant expression of ectopic c-Myc was
closely correlated with the reduced sensitivity of the cells to potent suppression by a
combination of Lapatinib and IBET (Figure 3G column 4 vs 2).

Author Manuscript

To control for potential off-target effects of the c-Myc shRNA, we generated a c-Myc
expressing vector that contains silent mutations in the sequence that is targeted by the c-Myc
shRNA. Our results showed that Doxycline modestly reduced the c-Myc protein in control
cells, as expected (Figure S3D, lanes 1 and 2, bottom). Lapatinib induced c-Myc expression
in vector control cells as expected (lane 3) and the expression of endogenous c-Myc was
reduced by Doxycline induced c-Myc shRNA (lane 4), which correlated with Lapatinibinduced reduction of the number of the Lapatinib-treated cells (graph above lane 4).
Consistently, ectopic expression of wild-type c-Myc led to increased level of c-Myc (Figure
S3D lane 5), and induction of c-Myc shRNA by Doxycycline resulted in suppression of cMyc expression (lane 6), consistent with the reduction of the number of the Lapatinibtreated cells (graph bar above lane 6). Likewise, ectopic expression of c-Myc with the
silence mutation in the shRNA target site also led to increased c-Myc protein expression

(lane 7). Notably, Doxycycline-induced c-Myc shRNA failed to substantially suppress cMyc expression, consistent with the resistance of the cells to Lapatinib-induced suppression
of cell growth (graph bar above lane 8). Collectively, these results strongly suggest that the
shRNA-mediated suppression of c-Myc, but not the off target effects of c-Myc shRNA,
cooperates with Lapatinib to suppress the breast cancer cells.
Together, the above four lines of evidence strongly suggest the Lapatinib-induced c-Myc is
crucial for reducing sensitivity of the cancer cells to Lapatinib.
A c-Myc epigenetic inhibitor synergizes with Lapatinib to suppress breast cancer cells

Author Manuscript

Consistently, IBET synergized with Lapatinib to suppress cell growth of BT474 cells, with a
combination index (CI) of 0.61 (Figure 4A), where a CI < 1 indicates a synergy (Chou,
2010). IBET also synergized with AKTi to suppress growth of MDA-MB-361 (Figure 4B)
and MCF-HER2 cells (Figure S4A). To assess whether the FOXO/c-Myc axis affects the
activity of an AKT inhibitor in PIK3CA mutant breast cancer cells without concurrent HER2
amplification, such as T47D cells (Aksamitiene et al., 2010), we treated T47D cells with
AKTi and/or IBET, and found that indeed treatment of T47D cells with AKTi alone had
little effect on growth of the cancer cells up to 500 nM (Figure S4B, right panel). Notably,
IBET substantially sensitized the single agent AKTi-induced suppression of the growth of
T47D cells (Figure S4B, left panel). Consistently, AKTi induced c-Myc expression, which
was suppressed by IBET (data not shown). These findings are consistent with the notion that
Lapatinib/AKTi-induced c-Myc is crucial for reducing the cancer cell sensitivity to
Lapatinib/AKTi, but suppression of c-Myc by IBET increased the sensitivity.

Author Manuscript

We also treated HER2+ UACC812 cells, and found that Lapatinib-induced c-Myc
expression was effectively suppressed by treatment with IBET (Figure S4C), which
enhanced Lapatinib-induced suppression of the cell growth (Figure S4D). Collectively, these
results strongly suggest that IBET or knockdown of IBET target synergizes with Lapatinib
to suppress the breast cancer cells and that Lapatinib-induced c-Myc expression dampens
sensitivity of the HER2+ breast cancer cells of to Lapatinib.
Furthermore, colony formation assay showed that IBET also synergized with Lapatinib to
suppress BT474 cells (Figure 4C), and with AKTi to suppress MBA MB 361 cells (Figure
4D). Altogether, these results indicate that IBET-mediated suppression of c-Myc, at least
partly, contributes to increasing sensitivity, or reducing resistance, to Lapatinib. We also
found that knockdown of BRD4, a target of IBET, also abolished Lapatinib-induced
expression of c-Myc (Figure 4E) and also reduced cell growth. Notably BRD4 knockdown
further reduced the Lapatinib-induced suppression of cell growth (Figure 4F).

FOXOs mediate Lapatinib-induced expression of c-Myc
While we have shown that Lapatinib or AKTi-induced c-Myc is crucial for reducing
Lapatinib sensitivity, little is known as to how Lapatinib induces c-Myc expression. We
noticed that Lapatinib not only markedly increased expression of c-Myc, but also
dramatically increased expression of total FOXO1 (Figure S2C) and reduced FOXO1
phosphorylation (Figure 2B). This observation of close association of FOXO1 and c-Myc

regulation prompted us to investigate whether FOXOs affects c-Myc expression. However, a
link between FOXO activation and c-Myc expression is paradoxical and unexpected, as
normally FOXOs are tumor-suppressing factors while c-Myc is a bona fide proto-oncogene,
and in fact FOXOs and c-Myc mutually antagonize each other in various settings (Bouchard
et al., 2007; Peck et al., 2013).

Author Manuscript

Notably, when we treated BT474 cells with a small molecule FOXO1 inhibitor that binds to
unphosphorylated FOXO1 and decreases FOXO1 transactivation (Nagashima et al., 2010),
Lapatinib-induced expression of c-Myc and Bcl2 was markedly reduced at both the mRNA
and protein levels (Figure 5A and Figure S5A). We further found that FOXO1 knockdown
substantially reduced Lapatinib-induced c-Myc expression (Figure 5B). Knockdown of both
FOXO1 and 3 moderately reduced cell growth, but further reduced Lapatinib-mediated
suppression of the cell growth (Figure 5C). Consistently, FOXO1/3 knockdown also
potently blocked Lapatinib-induced c-Myc expression at both the mRNA and protein level
(Figure 5D-E). Similarly, FOXO1/3 knockdown also blocked Lapatinib-induced expression
of Bcl2 (Figure S5B and Figure 5E).
To extend our findings to additional HER2 amplified or PIK3CA mutated cell lines, we
knocked down expression of FOXO1/3 in MDA-MB-361 cells, and found that the FOXO
knockdown decreased ATKi-induced c-Myc expression (Figure S5C). Consistently,
knockdown of FOXOs in HER2+ UACC812 cells, while modestly, decreased Lapatinibinduced expression of c-Myc (Figure S5D). Moreover, the FOXO inhibitor (FOXOi) also
reduced Lapatinib-induced c-Myc expression (Figure S5E). Together, these results
demonstrate that FOXO1/3 are required for Lapatinib-induced c-Myc expression and their
knockdown sensitizes the cancer cells to Lapatinib-induced suppression of cell growth.

Author Manuscript

MLL2 and its partners are crucial for reducing sensitivity to Lapatinib

Author Manuscript

We showed that MLL2 was crucial for expression of c-Myc, but not Bclxl, and we thus
determined whether MLL2 is also crucial for Lapatinib-induced c-Myc expression. We
found that MLL2 knockdown in BT474 cells reduced cell growth, and Lapatinib further
reduced the growth of MLL2 knockdown cells (Figure 5F). Consistently, MLL2 knockdown
also markedly suppressed Lapatinib-induced upregulation of the c-Myc mRNA (Figure 5G).
It is currently unclear what precise proportion of the effects of MLL2 knockdown on cell
viability is due to loss of c-Myc expression. Moreover, knockdown of GCN5, a histone
acetyltransferase, also suppressed Lapatinib-induced expression of c-Myc (Figure S5F).
These findings suggest that epigenetic regulator MLL2, its partners, and GCN5 play a
crucial role in Lapatinib-induced expression of c-Myc and reduction of sensitivity to
Lapatinib treatment.
Lapatinib induces direct binding of FOXOs to the c-Myc promoter to promote c-Myc
expression
We explored whether FOXOs directly bind the c-Myc locus. Notably, a survey of DNA
sequence in the c-Myc locus revealed a consensus “TGTTTAC” sequence of the FOXO
binding element (FBE) in the c-Myc promoter that is conserved across multiple species
(Figure 6A). Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay indicated that Lapatinib induced

binding of FOXO1/3 to the c-Myc promoter in BT474 cells (Figure 6B). To further
determine whether the FOXO binding site is crucial for FOXO-mediated gene transcription,
we constructed a luciferase reporter driven by either the wild-type FBE from the c-Myc
promoter or its mutant form, and transfected them into BT474 cells, followed by Lapatinib
treatment and detection of the mRNA of the reporter gene. We found that Lapatinib
increased expression of the reporter driven by the wild-type FBE four fold, but not by the
mutant FBE (Figure 6C), indicating that the FBE in the c-Myc promoter is required for
FOXO-mediated expression of c-Myc.
Importantly, Lapatinib induced the recruitment of MLL2 to the c-Myc promoter (Figure 6D)
and increased detection of GCN5 (Figure 6E) and histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation
(H3K4m3) and histone H3 acetylation (Figure 6F), both histone markers for active gene
transcription, at the c-Myc locus.

ChIP assay showed that FOXOi did not affect FOXO binding to the c-Myc promoter (data
not shown), but reduced Lapatinib-induced recruitment of MLL2 and RNA polymerase II,
H3K4m3, and histone acetylation at the c-Myc locus (Figure 6G and Figure S6A). Similarly,
FOXOi also reduced the recruitment of MLL2 to the Bcl2 locus (Figure S6B) and the level
of H3K4m3 mark and histone acetylation at the locus, while not affecting the level of total
histone H3 (Figure S6C). We also found BRD4, at the c-Myc promoter in cells treated with
Lapatinib, but IBET potently inhibited binding of BRD4 to the c-Myc locus (Figure 6H),
while not affecting FOXO1 translocation to the nucleus (Figure S3C, lane 4). Consistently,
binding of FOXO1/3 or MLL2 to the c-Myc promoter was also induced by Lapatinib in
HER2+ UACC812 cells as shown by ChIP assay (Figure S6D). Collectively, these results
indicate that Lapatinib induces FOXO binding to the c-Myc promoter, enhances the
recruitment of epigenetic regulators including MLL2 to the c-Myc promoter, and increases
histone acetylation and recruitment of BRD4 at the c-Myc locus. This coordinated action
may lead to increased expression of target genes such as c-Myc, and at least partly results in
reduced sensitivity to Lapatinib. Inhibition of BRD4 binding reduces transcription of c-Myc
but increases the sensitivity to Lapatinib in the breast cancer cells, and synergizes with
Lapatinib to suppress the growth of breast cancer cells.
Lapatinib and IBET synergistically suppress HER2+ cancer in xenograft models

Author Manuscript

To determine whether a combination of Lapatinib and IBET synergizes to suppress the
HER2+ breast cancer in xenograft models, we first induced tumors in immunodeficient mice
with transplantation of BT474 cells. When the tumors were formed visibly, we started to
treat the mice with control vehicle, Lapatinib, IBET, or a combination of Lapatinib and
IBET. At the end of the observation, the tumors were collected, and used for making RNA
or for immunohistochemistry analysis.
We found that treatment of the mice with either Lapatinib or IBET alone moderately slowed
the tumor growth (Figure 7A). Notably, a combination of Lapatinib and IBET significantly
reduced growth of the tumor (Figure 7A). The body weight of the mice in 4 groups of the
mice was not substantially changed (data not shown). Consistently, Lapatinib also induced
expression of c-Myc, but treatment with IBET blocked c-Myc and Bcl2 induction in the
collected tumor samples, as shown by qRT-PCR (Figure 7B). While the Lapatinib and IBET

combination did not show marked reduction in the tumors in size (Figure 7A), H&E staining
of the tumor tissue showed that the number of cells was substantially reduced in the tumor
treated with the combination, filled with fibrosis-like tissue (Figure 7C). Consistently,
immunofluorescent staining showed that c-Myc was induced in the tumor cells treated with
Lapatinib, but the induction was quenched by IBET treatment (Figure 7D).

We also performed a similar tumor xenograft experiment using another HER2-amplified cell
line, UACC812. Consistently, we found that treatment of the mice bearing UACC812 cellderived tumors with either Lapatinib or IBET alone only moderately suppressed the tumor
growth (Figure S7A). Notably, a combination of Lapatinib and IBET led to significant
suppression of the tumor burden (Figure S7A) Lapatinib upregulated expression of c-Myc,
as shown by immunohistochemistry staining, but IBET treatment substantially reduced
Lapatinib induced c-Myc expression (Figure S7B). Together, these in vivo studies strongly
suggest that targeting the MLL2/FOXO/BRD4/c-Myc axis may represent a great avenue to
increase sensitivity and reduce resistance to inhibitors of the HER2/AKT pathway, leading
to marked improvement of therapy.

DISCUSSION

Author Manuscript

We took an unbiased shRNA screening approach and identified multiple components from
the MLL2 complex that are crucial for the maintenance of HER2+ BT474 breast cancer
cells. By investigating the potential role of the MLL2 complex and associating factors in
response of the breast cancer cells to inhibitors of the HER2/AKT pathway, we uncovered
an important link between the epigenetic MLL2 complex/FOXO/c-Myc axis and reducing
sensitivity of HER2+ breast cancer cells to the HER2 inhibitor, Lapatinib. These findings are
crucial and significant in the following aspects: First, as the HER2/PI3K/AKT pathway is
often upregulated or activated in a broad spectrum of cancers (Courtney et al., 2010), and
targeting the kinases of this pathway is promising yet thus far has only yielded limited
success due to quick development of reduced sensitivity (Chandarlapaty et al., 2011;
Muranen et al., 2011), our findings of an intrinsic and epigenetic pathway that partially
accounts for the reduced sensitivity unravels multiple epigenetic components that could be
targeted to improve therapy.

Author Manuscript

Second, as FOXOs and c-Myc are normally considered tumor suppressor and oncogene
respectively (Bouchard et al., 2007; Peck et al., 2013), our findings that FOXOs positively
regulate c-Myc to reduce sensitivity of the cancer cells to Lapatinib or AKTi provide
insights into how tumor suppressing FOXOs act in concert with c-Myc to reduce the
sensitivity to Lapatinib in the breast cancer cells. These findings suggest means to sensitize
the HER2+ or PI3K/AKT pathway-activated breast cancer cells to the inhibitors to improve
the therapy.
Third, mechanistically, we found that the MLL2/FOXO axis regulates transcription of cMyc mRNA in concert with a cascade of other chromatin modifying or associating proteins
such as GCN5 and BRD4. Finally, as a proof of principle based on these mechanistic
findings (Figure 8), we found that an epigenetic inhibitor against BRD4, IBET, synergizes
with Lapatinib at lower concentrations to suppress HER2+ cancer in vitro and in vivo. It is

conceivable that multiple components in this pathway can also be similarly targeted in
combination with the HER2/PI3K/AKT inhibitors to cause synthetic lethality in other types
of cancer cells and improve therapy.

Author Manuscript

We uncovered that multiple epigenetic regulators, including components from the MLL2
epigenetic complex such as MLL2, WDR5, RBBP5 and GCN5 are crucial for growth of
BT474 cells. These proteins upregulate expression of multiple pro-proliferative/survival
targets, including c-Myc and Bcl2. In contrast, other methyltransferases such as MLL3 and
MLL4 did not affect growth of the breast cancer cells, indicating a specific role for MLL2 in
regulating these target genes in breast cancer cells. Although loss-of-function mutations in
MLL2 lead to inherited Kabuki syndrome and follicular lymphoma (Makrythanasis et al.;
Morin et al., 2011), a recent report suggests that MLL2 plays an important role in
maintenance of HER2+ colon cancer cells via upregulating ITGB4 and NRG1 (Guo et al.,
2012). Thus the function of MLL2 and its related proteins in regulating cancer cells may be
cell-type or signaling pathway-specific. It is also possible that other epigenetic regulators,
while not the components of the MLL2 complex (such as GCN5, BPTF, and BRDs), are
also involved in the process because they are also crucial for growth of the HER+ cancer
cells. These findings pave the way to investigate whether this epigenetic pathway is also
crucial for regulating the cancer cell sensitivity to other inhibitors of the HER2/PI3K/AKT
pathway.

Author Manuscript

While the HER2/PI3K/AKT pathway is often upregulated or activated in multiple types of
cancers (Courtney et al., 2010), targeted inhibition of this pathway has only met limited
success due to reduced sensitivity via various mechanisms including up-regulation of RTKs
(Chandarlapaty et al., 2011; Garrett et al., 2011; Muranen et al., 2011). Our results suggest
that HER2/AKT inhibitor-induced FOXO/c-Myc is an important axis that reduces sensitivity
to the inhibitors, as these inhibitors induced c-Myc expression in multiple HER2+ or
PIK3CA-mutated human breast cancer cell lines, and down-regulating c-Myc expression
synergizes with Lapatinib to suppress HER2+ breast cancer cells.

Author Manuscript

Our data also suggest that temporally in the early phase of treatment Lapatinib suppressed
cell growth and survival, likely partly via upregulating expression of Bim and CDKI like
p27kip by Lapatinib-activated FOXOs (Greer and Brunet, 2005). In the late phase of
treatment after 3-6 days, on daily treatment with Lapatinib, expression of c-Myc is further
upregulated by marked upregulation of FOXOs in concert with other epigenetic regulators
including the MLL2 complex, thereby reducing sensitivity to Lapatinib. This may also
partly explain that c-Myc is important for tumor dormancy after treatment (Bellovin et al.,
2013), as Lapatinib may lead to cell killing in early treatment but its chronic effect on c-Myc
induction may facilitate development of tumor dormancy. Other pathways including
Estrogen receptor signaling and Lapatinib-induced RTKs are also likely involved in
regulating or crosstalk with the FOXO/c-Myc axis in response to HER2 inhibition.
However, we cannot rule out the possibility that the synergistic effect of Lapatinib and IBET
also involves additional factors beyond c-Myc. The Lapatinib-induced c-Myc expression
reduces the drug sensitivity likely partly via multiple pathways including regulating
ribosomal biogenesis, as well as reprogramming the cancer metabolic pathways and
promoting survival (van Riggelen et al., 2010).

It is noteworthy that inhibition of the HER2/AKT pathway inevitably leads to activation of
FOXOs, which are normally tumor-suppressing factors (Zhang et al., 2011), by reducing
FOXO phosphorylation. FOXOs antagonize c-Myc in renal cell carcinoma RCC4 cells,
possibly by increasing the expression of miR-145 (Gan et al., 2010). Thus, our findings
define an intrinsic adaptive pathway via FOXO/c-Myc to reduce drug sensitivity.

Author Manuscript

Our results show that the normally mutually antagonistic FOXOs and c-Myc cooperate to
reduce sensitivity to Lapatinib in breast cancer cells with enhanced HER2/PI3K signaling.
While constitutively high expression or amplification of c-Myc in a subset of breast cancer
cells results in resistance to PI3K inhibitor (Ilic et al., 2011), our findings indicate that in the
breast cancer cells with enhanced HER2/PI3K signaling the basal level of c-Myc is not
crucial for maintenance of the cells. Rather, Lapatinib-induced c-Myc expression mediated
by MLL2/FOXO is responsible for reducing sensitivity to Lapatinib. These findings raise an
attractive possibility that inhibiting MLL2/FOXOs/c-Myc axis synergizes with the HER2/
PI3K/AKT inhibitors to suppress HER2+ breast cancer and likely other PI3K/AKT-activated
cancers as well. Conceivably, preemptively targeting this common and intrinsic pathway
that reduces the drug sensitivity may be a good strategy to improve the therapeutic efficacy
of the HER2/AKT/PI3K inhibitors.

Author Manuscript

Our findings suggest the following model: First, Lapatinib or PI3K/AKT inhibitor
suppresses the kinases, leading to activation of FOXOs, which in turn translocate into the
nucleus and recruits MLL2 and GCN5 to their target gene, c-Myc, to add active histone
marks, including H3K4m3 and histone acetylation. The modified histones can further recruit
proteins such as BPTF, an H3K4m3 binding protein, and BRD4, an acetylated histonebinding protein, to the target genes, leading to increased gene transcription (Figure 8). MLL
and GCN5 complexes can both be recruited to an Myc gene to epigenetically upregulate its
expression (Choi and Boss, 2012). It is likely that FOXO and/or FOXO-mediated MLL2 is
also conducive to recruitment of GCN5 and histone acetylation at the locus. While extensive
work was carried out to unravel the epigenetic pathway in regulating the sensitivity of
HER2+ breast cancer cells to the HER2 and AKT inhibitors, the detailed mechanisms
governing their crosstalk of the pathway's components remain to be further investigated.
Nevertheless, these players are crucial for reducing the sensitivity of the cancer cells to
Lapatinib as knockdown of FOXO1/3, MLL2 and BRD4 potentiated Lapatinib-induced
suppression of the cancer cells.

Author Manuscript

IBET was not very effective as a single agent in inhibiting HER2+ breast cancer cells with
the dose used in our study. Rather, a combination of Lapatinib with IBET synergistically
suppressed HER2+ breast cancer cells in cell culture more effectively at lower
concentrations of Lapatinib/AKTi and in a mouse model. This combination blocks
Lapatinib-induced upregulation of c-Myc, and it is conceivable that IBET can also inhibit
expression of other genes besides c-Myc that are induced by Lapatinib such as HER3. As
such, it is possible that inhibitors of epigenetic regulators involved in the MLL2/FOXO/cMyc axis, such as MLL2, WDR5, BPTF, and GCN5 could also be targeted to improve
HER2/PI3K/AKT inhibitor-mediated therapy. While a combination of Lapatinib and IBET
also suppressed growth of UACC812 cell-derived tumors more effectively, the combination
did not eliminate the tumor. It is possible that the cancer cells were influenced by additional

microenvironmental factors during the treatment. Alternatively, it is also possible that better
dosing and timing is needed to further increase the efficacy. These results also indicate that
multiple components in the epigenetic MLL2/FOXO axis could be preemptively or
simultaneously targeted with the HER2/PI3K/AKT inhibitors to cause synthetic lethality of
the HER2+ breast cancers. Other types of tumors with the constitutively active RTK/
PI3K/AKT pathway may also be susceptible to this strategy.

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Cell lines, cell culture, drug treatment, and plasmids

Author Manuscript

UACC812 cell line, which contains HER2 amplification, MDA-MB-361, and T47D cell
lines, which harbor a PIK3CA active mutation (Aksamitiene et al., 2010), were purchased
from ATCC. BT-474 cell line was a gift from Dr. Lewis Chodosh, MCF-HER2 and MCFNeo cell lines were gifts from Dr. Mien-Chi Hung. To generate a cell line with conditional
expression of c-Myc shRNA, shRNA oligonucleotides for c-Myc was cloned into pLKO-teton vector from Addgene. BT474 cells were transduced with either scramble or shRNA
targeted against c-Myc mRNA. Cells were selected with puromycin. Wild-type c-Myc was
cloned in MSCV-neo vector from Addgene. To obtain c-Myc impervious to shRNA
knockdown site directed mutagenesis of this plasmid was performed to change 5’CAGCAAC to 5’-ATCGAAT using a kit from Stratagene. All cell lines were cultured in
DMEM with 10% FBS and 1% Penicillin/ Streptomycin and maintained at 37° C and 5%
CO2.
Immunoblotting

Author Manuscript

Lysates from cells in culture were prepared by washing twice in cold PBS followed by lysis
with either SDS-lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl (pH8), 100 mM NaCl, 1% SDS) or RIPAlysis buffer supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors. For lysis in SDS, lysates
were boiled for 5 minutes followed by brief sonication. Lysates were cleared by
centrifugation at 14,000×g (10 min) and the supernatant was collected. Protein concentration
of each sample was determined using the BCA kit (Pierce) per manufacturer's instructions.
Proteins (25 or 50 μg) was loaded onto 4- 10% SDS-PAGE minigels for immunoblotting.
qRT-PCR
Total RNA was extracted from cultured cells using Trizol as previously reported (Thiel et
al., 2010). RNA (1 μg) was used to make cDNA. Real time PCR was performed using 7500
fast real time PCR System. SDS software was used for data analysis. Sequence of the probes
used can be found in supplemental information.

SIGNIFICANCE
While the HER2/PI3K/AKT pathway is frequently mutated in a wide range of cancers,
thus driving tumorigenesis, inhibitors of this pathway such as Lapatinib yield only
limited success, as the cancer cells often adapt quickly. We found that the MLL2/
FOXO/c-Myc axis was activated by Lapatinib, reducing sensitivity to the drug. These
findings not only uncover an intrinsic adaptation pathway comprising the normally
mutually antagonizing players, FOXOs and c-Myc, that are regulated by multiple
epigenetic regulators, but also highlight several key components in the pathway for future
targeting to improve therapy. As a proof of principle, a BRD4 inhibitor and Lapatinib
synergistically suppressed HER2+ breast cancer cells in vitro and in vivo, at least partly,
by targeting the MLL2/FOXO/c-Myc axis.
