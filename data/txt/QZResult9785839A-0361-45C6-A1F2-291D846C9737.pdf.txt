ABSTRACT
Previous studies have shown that intensive macropinocytosis occurs in cancer
cells and neutral red (NR) is noted for its capability to enter into the cell massively
through a process mimetic to macropinocytosis. In addition, trans-cinnamic acid (tCA)
has been found to be an inhibitor of histone deacetylase (HDAC). In the present study,
cinnamoylphenazine (CA-PZ) that consists of NR and tCA moieties was synthesized
and evaluated. As shown, CA-PZ massively entered into colon carcinoma HT-29
cells and pancreatic carcinoma MIA PaCa-2 cells and this entry was blocked by
5-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl) amiloride (EIPA, an inhibitor of macropinocytosis), indicating
a macropinocytosis-mediated uptake. Furthermore, CA-PZ markedly increased the
protein expression levels of acetyl-H3, acetyl-H4 and p21 in HT-29 cells and MIA
PaCa-2 cells. CA-PZ significantly inhibited the growth of colon carcinoma HT-29 and
pancreatic carcinoma MIA PaCa-2 xenografts. By in vivo imaging, CA-PZ displayed
prominent accumulation in the tumor xenografts. The study indicates that the
newly synthesized CA-PZ acts as an HDAC inhibitor in association with intensive
macropinocytosis-mediated intracellular delivery in cancer cells. The use of neutral
red for preparation of chimeric molecules with the attribute of macropinocytosismediated intracellular delivery might open an alternative way for development of
HDAC inhibitors.

INTRODUCTION

Macropinocytosis may be relevant to the expression
of histone deacetylase (HDAC). As shown, membrane
ruffle formation, macropinocytosis, and cell migration
are all impaired in HDAC 6-deficient cells; conversely,
elevated HDAC6 levels promote membrane ruffle
formation associated with the increase of macropinocytosis
and cell motility [8]. HDAC plays an important role
in epigenetic mechanisms. The disturbance in histone
acetylation or deacetylation may cause alterations in the
transcriptional regulation of tumor suppressor genes or
oncogenes. Therefore, the changes in histone acetylation
may influence gene transcription [9]. Studies have found
that cancer is linked to histone hypoacetylation which
arises from HDAC overexpression; and the anti-cancer
effects of HDAC inhibitors have been attributed to the
restoration of histone acetylation balance [10–12]. As
known, HDACs are a vast family of enzymes and play
crucial roles in numerous biological processes and their
expression levels may vary among different cancer cells.
HDAC1 is overexpressed in prostate and gastric cancers,

Recent
studies
have
demonstrated
that
macropinocytosis is significantly activated in a variety
of cancer cells. Macropinocytosis is exploited by a range
of pathogens for cellular invasion and avoidance of
immune surveillance [1]. Among known endocytic routes,
macropinocytosis provides a unique pathway for intracellular
entry with a form of bulk uptake and can therefore
efficiently and rapidly internalize the carried substances [2].
Notably, macropinocytosis is markedly enhanced in K-rastransformed pancreatic carcinoma cells; apparently, it may
represent an important route of tumor nutrient uptake [3].
Besides playing important roles in a range of physiological
processes, macropinocytosis is highly relevant to cell
migration and tumor metastasis [4, 5]. Macropinocytosis
could be induced by the stimulation of epidermal growth
factor receptor (EGFR), leading to the enhancement of
cellular uptake [6]. In addition, macropinocytosis may be
stimulated by a nucleolin-dependent mechanism [7].

where it signalizes poor prognosis [13–15]. High levels
of HDAC2 have been found in colorectal, cervical and
gastric cancers [16, 17]. HDAC3 is overexpressed in
gastric, prostate and colorectal cancer [18]; and high
expression level of HDAC1 and HDAC2 correlates
with decreased patient survival in colorectal carcinomas
[19, 20]. Various HDACs display different intracellular
localization. HDAC1, 2, 3, 8 and 11 are mainly found in
the nucleus, while HDAC6 and 10 are primarily found
in the cytoplasm. However, HDAC4, 5, 7 and 9 can be
found both in the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Studies have
indicated that HDACs are potential novel therapeutic
targets. A number of HDAC inhibitors have reached
clinical trials and several being approved for cancer
treatment [21–25]. The most extensively used biomarkers
for the investigation of HDAC inhibitors were H3 and H4
[26]. In addition, many HDAC inhibitors were found to
increase the levels of p21 in a concentration dependent
manner [27]. In tumor cells, HDAC inhibitor-induced
activation of p21 is controlled by a cross-talk of reversible
phosphorylation and acetylation signals [28]. HDAC
inhibition may disturb the balance between pro- and antiapoptotic proteins, causing tumor cell death [29–31].
Cinnamic acid has been found to display a broad
spectrum of biological effects including antioxidant,
anti-inflammatory and anticancer activities [32–34]. Our
previous study has demonstrated that trans-cinnamic
acid (tCA) is active as an HDAC inhibitor and it is
effective against colon carcinoma xenograft [35]. In
addition, neutral red (NR), 3-amino-7-dimethylamino-2methylphenazine, is a well-known compound that enters
into the cell massively by the process of macropinocytosis.
Considering the facts that HDAC collectively is an

intracellular localized target and tCA can act as an HDAC
inhibitor and that neutral red can enter the cell by intensive
macropinocytosis, it is of interest to design and prepare a
new HDAC inhibitor endowed with the capacity of both
intensive macropinocytosis and active HDAC inhibition.
The present study is set to synthesize a new compound
cinnamoylphenazine (CA-PZ) that integrates NR and tCA,
to assess the effect of CA-PZ on HDAC in cancer cells
and its antitumor efficacy; moreover, to investigate its
molecular mechanism of action.

RESULTS
Preparation and purification of CA-PZ
The synthetic compound CA-PZ that integrates
tCA and NR was prepared by condensation reaction. The
electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (MS-ESI) and
1
H NMR (300 MHz) detection confirmed the conjugation.
By high performance liquid chromatography, the purity
of the synthetic sample was 95.8%. The molecular
formula for CA-PZ is C24H22N4O and molecular weight
is 382.1794. MS-ESI showed that the main peak was
383.2. 1H NMR (300 MHz) showed the proper number of
hydrogen ion in each group (Figure 1).

Macropinocytosis-mediated uptake of CA-PZ in
carcinoma cells
As shown by confocal microscopy, there occurred
a massive uptake of CA-PZ both in HT29 cells and MIA
PaCa-2 cells. In HT29 cells, the CA-PZ treated cells
displayed appreciably high level of macropinosome

formation as seen by red fluorescence; apparently, the
intensity was comparable to that in NR-treated cells.
However, the tCA-treated cells and the controls almost
showed no fluorescence. In addition, the uptake of CA-PZ
and NR was inhibited by 5-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl)
amiloride (EIPA), an inhibitor of macropinosome
formation (Figure 2A). Similar results were obtained in
the case of MIA PaCa-2 cells; as shown, the inhibition by
EIPA was much more obvious (Figure 2B).

control TSA (Figure 5A and 5B). The cells undergoing
apoptosis were observed by the APC Annexin V staining.
A significant increase of APC Annexin V stained cells
was detected in MIA PaCa2 cells after CA-PZ treatment
(Figure 5C).

Tumor localization and accumulation
An optical molecular imaging system was used to
evaluate the tumor localization and CA-PZ accumulation
in colon carcinoma HT29 and pancreatic carcinoma MIA
PaCa-2 xenograft-bearing mice. As shown (Figure 2C),
CA-PZ penetrated into in the HT29 and MIA PaCa-2
tumor xenografts within 1 hour after i.v. injection
and then most of the fluorescence signal of CA-PZ
gradually localized and accumulated in the tumors. CAPZ accumulation reached the highest level within 2–3 h
after injection and then faded within 8 h. This observation
confirmed the specific distribution of CA-PZ, a small
molecule compound, in colon carcinoma HT29 and
pancreatic carcinoma MIA PaCa-2 xenografts.

Inhibition of cancer cell proliferation by CA-PZ
Determined by MTT assay, CA-PZ in a
concentration-dependent
manner
inhibited
the
proliferation of various cancer cell lines, including HT29,
MIA PaCa-2, OVCAR3, and L02 (Figure 3). As shown,
HT-29 cells were relatively more sensitive to CP-PZ. The
IC50 values of CA-PZ for HT29, OVCAR-3, and MIA
PaCa-2 cancer cells were 121.6 ± 9.6 μM, 186.9 ± 3.0 μM,
and 292.9 ± 10.7 μM, respectively. The IC50 values of
tCA for all the tested cancer cell lines were over 500 μM.
In comparison, the IC50 value of CA-PZ for L02 cells was
1152.8 ± 31.3 μM, indicating the non-cancerous cells were
rather insensitive to CA-PZ (Figure 3D).

Therapeutic efficacy of CA-PZ against colon
carcinoma HT29 and pancreatic carcinoma MIA
PaCa-2 xenografts

Increase of histone acetylation in cancer cells

Pancreatic carcinoma MIA PaCa-2 and colon
carcinoma HT29 xenograft models were used for
evaluation of the therapeutic efficacy. As shown (Figure 6A
and 6B), CA-PZ significantly suppressed the growth of
pancreatic carcinoma MIA PaCa-2 and colon carcinoma
HT29 xenografts. CA-PZ at doses of 1.0 mmol/kg
and 1.5 mmol/kg inhibited tumor growth by 32.2% and
62.4% (P < 0.05) in pancreatic carcinoma MIA PaCa2 xenograft, 52.6% (P < 0.05) and 58.8% (P < 0.01) in
colon carcinoma HT29 xenograft, respectively; while
tCA at 1.0 mmol/kg by 37.1% in colon carcinoma HT29
xenograft. During the experiment, no differences were
found in daily food intake between the treated athymic
mice and the controls. No deaths were found in all groups
of treated and control mice. Moreover, no significant body
weight changes occurred in the treated groups throughout
the duration of the study (Figure 6C and 6D).

To determine whether CA-PZ treatment could
increase the acetylation of histone proteins in HT29
cells and MIA PaCa-2 cells, Western blot analysis of
the extracted proteins from various cell lines, especially
HT29 and MIA PaCa-2 cells, was performed (Figure 4).
As shown, the expression levels of acetylated histones
H3 were highly varied in different cell lines (Figure 4A).
Notably, CA-PZ induced histone acetylation dosedependently in HT29 cells, resulted in the accumulation
of Ac-H3, Ac-H4, and p21 proteins. tCA and the wellknown HDAC inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA) induced
similar effects (Figure 4B, 4C). Similarly, CA-PZ induced
histone acetylation dose-dependently in MIA PaCa-2 cells,
resulting in the accumulation of Ac-H3, Ac-H4, and p21
proteins. tCA and TSA induced similar effects as those
found in HT-29 cells (Figure 4D).

Induction of apoptosis by CA-PZ

Immunohistochemical examination on HT29
tumor tissue

The induction of apoptosis by CA-PZ in HT29 cells
and MIA PaCa-2 cells was determined. In HT29 cells,
CA-PZ caused a significant increase in the expression
levels of Bax and Bim, while a significant decrease in the
expression level of Bcl-2. Similar changes were found in
the cells treated by tCA at 100 μM, NR at 100 μM, and
the known HDAC inhibitor TSA at 1 μM, respectively. In
addition, a decrease of PARP and an increase of cleaved
PARP occurred in HT29 cells after exposure to CA-PZ,
these changes were similar to those caused by the positive
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

To determine the changes of related proteins,
immunohistochemical analysis was performed using
specimens of HT29 colon carcinoma xenograft from the
control and CA-PZ-treated athymic mice. Both Ac-H3
and Ac-H4 were overexpressed in CA-PZ treated HT29
carcinoma. Moreover, cleaved caspase 3 and cleaved PARP
were overexpressed in CA-PZ treated HT29 carcinoma as
compared with the control. In addition, the expression of
Bim slightly increased after CA-PZ treatment (Figure 6E).

macropinocytosis. (B) Images of MIA PaCa-2 cells taken by fluorescence microscopy. The appearance of MIA PaCa-2 cells was similar to

Histopathological examination of various organs
from the CA-PZ treated mice

in vivo imaging, CA-PZ displayed prominent tumor
localization and accumulation. CA-PZ exerted therapeutic
efficacy against the pancreatic carcinoma MIA PaCa-2
and colon carcinoma HT29 xenografts in nude mice.
Moreover, CA-PZ markedly decreased the protein
expression levels of acetyl-H3, acetyl-H4 and p21, which
was consistent with effects of the known HDAC inhibitor
TSA, indicating that CA-PZ is an active HDAC inhibitor.
Evidently, the newly synthesized compound CA-PZ
retains the attributes of both NR and tCA, displaying
enhanced macropinocytosis-mediated uptake by the cell
and the effects of HDAC inhibitor. This bi-functional
property of the chimeric molecule is important for the
development of new cancer therapeutics, especially
for the pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), the
most common type of pancreatic cancer. On one hand,
macropinocytosis-mediated drug delivery may be used
for targeting K-Ras related cancers. As reported, K-Ras
mutation occurs in over 90% of PDAC. In this occasion,

At the end of experiment, specimens of various
organs including the heart, liver, lung, kidney, small
intestine, and femur bone marrow were taken from the
CA-PZ treated (1.5 mmol/kg) mice and the controls.
Histological sections of 5 μm in thickness were
stained with H&E. and observed with microscope. No
toxicopathological changes were found in the abovementioned organs of CA-PZ treated animals (Figure 6F).
The results suggested that the administrated doses of CA-PZ
were well tolerated.

DISCUSSION
The present study indicates that CA-PZ is active
as HDAC inhibitor in association with intensive
macropinocytosis-mediated entry into cancer cells. By

the expression levels of Ac-H3, Ac-H4, and p21 proteins were increased. Notably, tCA and the known HDAC inhibitor TSA (1 μM) caused
similar changes. However, NR (100 μM) caused less change. (D) Expression levels of acetylated histones H3 and H4, and p21 proteins in

the oncogenic K-Ras stimulates macropinocytosis to
support the nutrient need for cancer cell metabolism and
proliferation. Enhanced macropinocytosis was found in
K-Ras mutant pancreatic carcinoma cells; consequently,
the intensity of macropinocytosis in K-Ras mutant
carcinoma cells was much higher than that in wild type
carcinoma cells [3]. Therefore, intensive macropinocytosis
might be exploited to deliver massive payload of drugs to
target cancer cells. In our previous study, a recombinant
fusion protein that consists of β-defensin and albumin
(DF-HSA) was prepared. As shown, DF-HSA massively
enters into the K-Ras mutant pancreatic carcinoma cells. A
specific distribution and accumulation in tumor xenograft
was found by imaging. DF-HSA exerted potent therapeutic
efficacy on the tumor xenograft [38]. On the other hand,
there is evidence that HDAC inhibitors may play an
active role in the treatment of pancreatic cancer. An

investigation found that an HDAC inhibitor can prevent
the smoking- induced promotion of pancreatic carcinoma
[39]. An HDAC inhibitor was reported to be effective in
a PDAC mouse model [40]. As shown, targeting K-Ras
signaling alone has limited effects against PDAC in mouse
models; however, targeting HDAC in combination with
K-Ras targeting markedly enhanced the efficacy [41].
Above-mentioned studies highlight the relevance of
macropinocytosis to K-Ras mutant pancreatic carcinoma
and the great potential of HDAC inhibitors in treatment of
this refractory cancer. Therefore, the chimeric compound
CA-PZ warrants further evaluation.
Neutral red (NR) is a well-known agent used in
cytotoxicity assay for drug screening on the basis that NR
can be internalized into living cells. The intracellular entry
of NR can be blocked by the inhibitor EIPA; apparently,
this is a macropinocytosis-mediated endocytic process. In

comparison with other endocytic routes, macropinocytosis
is unique for its selectivity and the large payload. In the
present study, NR as a “guided module” was linked to
an “effector module” for constitution of a bi-functional
chimeric molecule. Macropinocytosis poses to be an
efficient path for drug delivery. To our knowledge, this is the
first report on the use of NR to prepare macropinocytosismediated HDAC inhibitor. The use of neutral red for
preparation of macropinocytosis-mediated agents might
open an alternative way for development of highly effective
HDAC inhibitors and relevant targeted drugs.

Macropinosome visualization
HT29 and MIA PaCa-2 cells were seeded onto
the Thermo Scientific Nunc Lab-Tek II chamber slides.
Twenty-four hours after seeding, CA-PZ, NR, tCA and
EIPA were added respectively. After 2 h, the supernatant
was discarded and cells were rinsed three times with
cold PBS and then stained with DAPI; then rinsed three
times in cold PBS, and immediately fixed for 15 min in
4% formaldehyde. Images were captured by confocal
microscopy LSM 710 (Zeiss, Weimar, Germany).
Because CA-PZ and NR have spontaneous fluorescence,
macropinosomes could be seen without labeling agent.

Cell culture
A number of human cancer cell lines have been used
in the study. The cell lines include pancreatic carcinoma
MIA PaCa-2 cells, colon carcinoma HT29 and HCT116
cells, lung carcinoma A549 and H460 cells, epidermoid
carcinoma A431 cells, ovary carcinoma OVCAR-3 cells,
and fibrosarcoma HT1080 cells. In addition, the noncancerous hepatocyte L02 cells were used. All the cell
lines were provided by the Cell Center of the Institute of
Basic Medical Sciences, Chinese Academy of Medical
Sciences and Peking Union Medical College. HCT116
cells, HT29 cells, A431 cells, A549 cells, H460 cells,
OVCAR-3 cells, HT1080 cells and L02 cells were grown
in modified RPMI-1640 supplemented with 10% heatinactivated fetal bovine serum, penicillin G (100 U/mL),
and streptomycin (100 μg/mL). MIA PaCa-2 cells
were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium
supplemented with the same substances as abovementioned. All cell lines were cultured at 37°C in a
humidified 5% CO2 incubator.

MTT assay
Cells were plated in 96-well plates at a density of
3000–5000 cells per well and incubated at 37°C for 24 h.
Then different concentrations of CA-PZ were added
respectively which was dissolved by DMSO in the ratio of
1:1000. At 48 h, MTT was added to each well and further
incubated for 4 h. Then, the medium containing MTT
solution was discarded, and 150 μL of DMSO were added
to each well. The absorbance (A) at 570 nm was detected
with a microplate reader (Multiskan MK3; Thermo Fisher
Scientific, MA, USA). Untreated cells were served as the
control. The CA-PZ relative cell viability (%) compared with
the control group was calculated according to the formula:
cell viability (%) = [(Atreat− Ablank)/(Acontrol − Ablank)] × 100%.

Synthesis and purification
The condensing reaction was performed between
cinnamoyl chloride and neutral red (NR) which is
the hydrochloride of 2-amino-8-dimethylamino-3methylphenazine (PZ), in the alkaline solvents N,
N-dimethylformamide (DMF) and triethylamine. The
ratio of NR and cinnamoyl chloride was 1:2.2. By
stirring at 58–61°C for about 72 h, the formed product
CA-PZ was extracted with 30 ml benzene and 60 ml
diethyl ether under stirring at room temperature. After
filtration, the filtrate was put into a dryer at 60°C for
2–4  h. Then the crude product CA-PZ was purified

under observation for one week before the experiment.
The experiment protocols were based on the Regulations
of Good Laboratory Practice for Non-clinical Laboratory
Studies of Drugs issued by the National Scientific and
Technologic Committee of the People’s Republic of China.
Colon carcinoma HT29 cells or pancreatic carcinoma
MIA PaCa-2 cells (1 × 107) suspended in 200 μL sterile
saline were inoculated s.c. in the right armpit of athymic
mouse. About 3–4 weeks later tumors in the donor animals
were aseptically dissected. After cautiously removing
the necrotic portion, the tumor mass was cut into pieces
of 2  mm3 in size. Then the tumor tissue piece was
transplanted subcutaneously by a trocar needle into the
athymic mice. When the tumor size reached approximately
100 mm3, mice were divided into several groups (n = 6),
including those treated with different doses of CA-PZ
(1.0 mmol/kg and 1.5 mmol/kg, respectively), tCA (1.0
mmol/kg) and the control group, which were dissolved
by 0.5% sodium carboxymethylcellulose (CMC). The
tested drugs were given by intragastric administration,
0.2 ml/20g, 3 times a week, for a total of 6 doses. The
short and long diameters of HT-29 and MIA PaCa-2 tumor
xenografts were measured every three days and the tumor
volumes were calculated. Tumor volume was estimated
by the following formula: V = 0.5a × b2, where a and b
represent the long and the perpendicular short diameters
of the tumor, respectively. Thirty-two days after tumor
inoculation, the animals were euthanized by isoflurane
anesthesia. The xenografts and specimens from various
organs were preserved in a 4% formaldehyde solution for
further examination.

After incubation at 37°C for 12 h, ice-cold PBS
solution was used to rinse the cells three times. Then
cells were lysed with the lysis buffer and the dishes were
incubated for 5–10 min at 4°C. The cells were scraped into
lysis buffer, and the lysates were clarified by centrifugation
(15, 294 × g, 10 min at 4°C). Protein concentrations were
determined using a BCA Protein Assay Kit from BioRad and Western blot was performed. Briefly, an equal
amount of total protein extracted from cultured cells
was separated by 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to the
polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes. Primary
antibodies and horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated
appropriate secondary antibodies were used to detect the
designated proteins. After shaking slightly at 4°C overnight,
the secondary antibodies bound on the PVDF membrane
were reacted to the ECL detection reagents and exposed to
X-ray films (Kodak, Japan). Antibody bound proteins were
detected by enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (Pierce).

Cell apoptosis assay
This was performed using APC Annexin V and
SYTOX® Green Nucleic Acid staining. In brief, cultured
HT29 cells were washed with cold PBS and the binding
buffer was added, then incubated with APC Annexin V
for 10 min and stained with SYTOX® Green Nucleic Acid
Stain for another 10 min at 4°C in dark. Then, the stained
cells were observed and photographed with confocal
microscopy within 60 min.

Localization of CA-PZ by in vivo optical
fluorescence imaging

Immunohistochemistry
Specimens taken from the HT29 xenografts were
used for immunohistochemical detection of various related
proteins, such as acetyl H3, Bim, cleaved PARP and cleaved
caspase 3. Sections of 4 μm in thickness were deparaffinized
and rehydrated with xylene and graded alcohol solutions.
After washing with PBS, endogenous peroxidase activity
was quenched by 3% hydrogen peroxide, and the sections
were boiled in 10 mM citrate buffer (pH 6.0) for 3–5 min
in an autoclave sterilizer followed by cooling at room
temperature for more than 30 min. After rinsing with
PBS, the sections were incubated with primary antibodies
(1:100 diluted in antibody diluent, Zhongshan Goldbridge
Biotechnology Co., Ltd, Beijing, China) overnight at 4°C.
Sections were stained with related antibodies, respectively.
After rinsing with PBS, the sections were incubated with
PV6001 or PV6002 (Zhongshan Goldbridge Biotechnology
CO., Ltd, Beijing, China) for 1 h at 37°C and stained with
DAB (AR1022, Boster Biological Technology, Ltd, Wuhan,
China) for 1 to 2 min. The slides were counterstained with
hematoxylin, dehydrated with graded ethanol, cleared
with xylene, and mounted in neutral gum. All slides were
analyzed by two independent observers.

Tumor localization of CA-PZ was investigated using
HT29 and MIA PaCa-2 xenografts in athymic mice. Cells
were inoculated to the right armpit of athymic mice. When
the solid tumors reached a volume of about 100–400 mm3,
CA-PZ which is with spontaneous fluorescence was
injected into the tail veins of mice (n = 3) at a dosage of 1.5
mmol/kg. Next, the mice were anesthetized by isofluorane
at several selected time points (1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8 h) and
placed in the imaging chamber of an IVIS-200 system
(Xenogen) for observation. Images and measurements of
CA-PZ fluorescence signals were analyzed using Living
Image-software (Xenogen) referred to in vivo imaging as
described [38].

Therapeutic experiment
Female BALB/c athymic mice (6–8 weeks old)
were purchased from the Institute for Experimental
Animals, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and
Peking Union Medical College. For the sake of making
mice adapted to the new environment, the mice were
