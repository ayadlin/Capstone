Abstract

Author Manuscript

Medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) is a neuroendocrine tumor mainly caused by mutations in the
RET proto-oncogene. For therapy of advanced MTC, the Food and Drug Administration recently
approved vandetanib and cabozantinib, the tyrosine kinase inhibitors targeting RET, vascular
endothelial growth factor receptor, epidermal growth factor receptor, and/or c-MET. Nevertheless,
not all patients respond to these drugs, demanding additional therapeutic strategies. We found that
mortalin (HSPA9/GRP75), a member of HSP70 family, is upregulated in human MTC tissues and
that its depletion robustly induces cell death and growth arrest in MTC cell lines in culture and in
mouse xenografts. These effects were accompanied by substantial downregulation of RET,
induction of the tumor suppressor TP53, and altered expression of cell cycle regulatory machinery
and apoptosis markers including E2F-1, p21CIP1, p27KIP1, and Bcl-2 family proteins. Our
investigation of the molecular mechanisms underlying these effects revealed that mortalin
depletion induces transient MEK/ERK activation and altered mitochondrial bioenergetics in MTC
cells, as indicated by depolarized mitochondrial membrane, decreased oxygen consumption and
extracellular acidification, and increased oxidative stress. Intriguingly, mortalin depletion induced
growth arrest partly via the MEK/ERK pathway whereas it induced cell death by causing
mitochondrial dysfunction in a Bcl-2 dependent manner. However, TP53 was not necessary for
these effects except for p21CIP1 induction. Moreover, mortalin depletion downregulated RET
expression independently of MEK/ERK and TP53. These data demonstrate that mortalin is a key
regulator of multiple signaling and metabolic pathways pivotal to MTC cell survival and
proliferation, proposing mortalin as a novel therapeutic target for MTC.

Introduction

Author Manuscript

Medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) is a neoplasm of the endocrine system, originating
from parafollicular C-cells of the thyroid gland which produce the hormone calcitonin 1.
MTC occurs sporadically or in hereditary forms, i.e., familial MTC and multiple endocrine
neoplasia (MEN) type 2 syndrome. MTC is relatively rare, comprising about 5% of all
thyroid cancers, and progresses slowly. Although extensive surgical resection of thyroid and
lymph nodes is mostly curative for primary MTC, it is not effective for metastatic or
recurrent MTC. Because MTC rarely responds to classic chemo- or radiation-therapies,
more advanced therapeutic modalities are necessary. MTC is mainly caused by altered
activity of the receptor tyrosine kinase, rearranged during transfection (RET), while other
oncogenic alterations including H- and K-Ras mutations are also detected in MTC at lower
frequencies 2-4. Accordingly, current therapeutic strategies for MTC are focused on RET
inhibition, and for surgically inoperable progressive MTC treatment, the Food and Drug
Administration recently approved vandetanib (trade name Caprelsa, AstraZeneca) and
cabozantinib (Cometriq, Exelixis), the multi-kinase inhibitors targeting RET and a few other
receptor tyrosine kinases 5, 6. Nevertheless, these drugs are not always effective, demanding
additional therapeutic strategies for treatment of MTC 5-7.

Author Manuscript

Mortalin (HSPA9/GRP75/PBP74), a member of the heat shock protein (HSP) 70 family 8, is
often overexpressed in different tumor types, including colon, liver, brain, breast, and skin
cancers 9-12. Although mortalin was originally identified as a mitochondrial molecular
chaperone 13, it is often detected in different subcellular compartments of cancer cells,
suggesting its functional alteration in cancer 10, 11, 14. Indeed, mortalin has been
characterized as an important regulator of tumor cell growth and survival. For example,
mortalin can mediate cytoplasmic sequestration of TP53 for negatively regulation of the
tumor suppressor in different tumor types 15-19. Mortalin could also affect Ras activity via
its interaction with mevalonate pyrophosphate decarboxylase, which regulates Ras
modification 20. Moreover, we recently reported that mortalin can regulate the
Raf/MEK/ERK pathway to promote proliferation and that mortalin upregulation may be
important for B-RafV600E cancer cells to bypass tumor suppressive responses triggered upon
aberrant MEK/ERK activation 12. Mortalin may facilitate tumor cell growth and survival via
additional functions.

Author Manuscript

In this study, we demonstrate that mortalin is upregulated in human MTC tissues and that it
has a pivotal role for MTC cell survival and proliferation, which are mediated via the
MEK/ERK pathway and mitochondrial bioenergetics in a distinct manner. Our data suggest
that mortalin is a key regulator of cell signaling and metabolism in MTC cells and, thus, a
novel therapeutic target for MTC treatment.

Results
Mortalin levels are upregulated in MTC
To examine mortalin levels in MTC, we conducted immunohistochemical analysis of 38
cases of MTC patient tissues in comparison with 46 normal thyroid tissues. Using a
mortalin-specific antibody previously validated for IHC 12, we found that mortalin protein

levels were significantly upregulated in the MTC tissues (Fig. 1A and 1B; H&E staining
shown in Supplemental Fig. S1). Consistent with this, our Western blot analysis revealed
that mortalin levels are relatively high in the human MTC cell lines, TT and MZ-CRC-1,
when compared with the primary normal human fibroblasts, and a positive control, MCF7
breast cancer cell line (Fig. 1C). MCF7 cells were previously shown to express mortalin
relatively highly among different cancer cell lines derived from tumors of breast, prostate,
colon, lung, and brain 11. TT and MZ-CRC-1, expressing RETC634W and RETM918T
respectively, are the most thoroughly characterized MTC lines and have been extensively
used to study molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of MTC. RETC634W and
RETM918T are most frequently detected oncogenic alterations in MTC, representing MEN
type 2A and 2B respectively 21. We therefore investigated the role of mortalin in MTC using
these cell line models.

Mortalin depletion induces cell cycle arrest in G0/G1 phase, apoptotic cell death, and RET
downregulation in MTC cells

Author Manuscript

Using lentiviral doxycycline-inducible small hairpin RNA (shRNA) expression system
(shMortmir) and transient shRNA expression system (shMort) that target different mRNA
regions, mortalin was substantially depleted in TT and MZ-CRC-1 cells (Fig. 2A and 2B;
Fig. 6B shows shMortmir effects in MZ-CRC-1). In these cell lines, mortalin depletion
consistently induced substantial downregulation of the S-phase transcription factor, E2F-1;
expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, p27KIP1; cleavage of the caspasedependent apoptosis marker, poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP); and RET
downregulation (Fig. 2A and 2B). Importantly, as demonstrated in TT cells, expression of an
exogenous mortalin gene engineered to avoid shMortmir (HA-Mort*) significantly
abolished shMortmir effects, indicating that these are specific effects of mortalin depletion
(Fig. 2C).

Author Manuscript

In agreement with these effects, mortalin knockdown strongly suppressed cell viability of
TT and MZ-CRC-1 in culture (Fig. 2D and 2E), which was significantly attenuated by
HAMort* expression, as determined in TT cells (Fig. 2F). Cell cycle analysis and annexin V
staining revealed that mortalin depletion suppressed MTC cell growth partly via G0/G1phase cell cycle arrest (Fig. 2G and 2H) and apoptosis (Fig. 2I). We also found that mortalin
depletion induced RET downregulation at mRNA level. As determined by RT-PCR,
mortalin depletion significantly decreased the levels of RET splicing variants, RET51/
variant 2 and RET9/variant 4 (Fig. 2J). In contrast, mortalin depletion did not significantly
affect mRNA levels of calcitonin gene splicing variants, CT and CGRP (Fig. 2J),
highlighting its specific effect on RET. These data suggest that mortalin is important for
MTC cell proliferation and survival.
TP53 is not necessary for mortalin depletion to induce growth inhibition in MTC cells
It was previously reported that mortalin can sequester TP53 in the cytosol, subsequently
inducing TP53 degradation and decreasing cellular tumor suppressive capacity 15-17.
Because TT cells express wild type TP53 (Cancer Genome Project at Sanger Institute, http://
www.sanger.ac.uk/), we determined whether TP53 was required for mortalin depletion to
suppress TT cell growth/survival. In TT cells, mortalin depletion mildly increased TP53

levels, which was accompanied by significant upregulation of p21CIP1, a cyclin-dependent
kinase inhibitor transcriptionally regulated by TP53 (Fig. 3A). When TP53 was depleted
under this condition by RNA interference, shMortmir-induced p21CIP1 upregulation was
substantially inhibited (Fig. 3A). Nevertheless, TP53 knockdown did not affect shMortmirinduced PARP cleavage, E2F1 downregulation, p27KIP1 upregulation, RET downregulation
(Fig. 3A), and growth arrest (Fig. 3B), suggesting that TP53 is not necessary for mortalin
depletion to suppress MTC cell proliferation and survival.
The MEK/ERK pathway mediates mortalin depletion-induced growth arrest but not cell
death

Author Manuscript

The MEK/ERK pathway can mediate growth arrest signaling in MTC cells via various
mechanisms 22-26. Because we recently discovered that mortalin can modulate MEK/ERK
activity 12, we questioned whether mortalin depletion suppressed MTC cell growth/survival
by altering MEK/ERK signaling. Indeed, as determined by ERK1/2 phosphorylation on the
activation loop (Thr202/Tyr204 for ERK1 and Thr183/Tyr185 for ERK2), mortalin
depletion increased MEK/ERK activity in TT and MZ-CRC-1 cells (Fig. 2A and 2B). In a
subsequent time-course study using TT cells stably expressing shMortmir, we found that
mortalin depletion induced transient MEK/ERK activation prior to the aforementioned
growth inhibitory effects (Supplemental Fig. S2B).

Author Manuscript

We next determined whether the MEK1/2 inhibitor, AZD6244, or MEK1/2 knockdown
could block shMortmir effects in TT cells. Short term AZD6244 treatment or knockdown of
both MEK1 and MEK2, albeit not singly knockdown, significantly reduced ERK1/2
phosphorylation (Fig. 3C and 3D). Under these conditions, shMortmir-induced E2F-1
downregulation and p27KIP1 expression was mildly but consistently attenuated (Fig.3C and
3D). Consistent with these effects, AZD6244 could partially rescue TT cells from
shMortmir-induced growth suppression (Fig. 3E) and cell cycle arrest (Fig. 3F). However,
interestingly, neither AZD6244 nor MEK1/2 knockdown inhibited shMortmir-induced
PARP cleavage and RET downregulation (Fig. 3C and 3D). These data indicate that the
MEK/ERK pathway is specifically involved in mortalin depletion-induced growth arrest, but
not cell death or RET downregulation, in MTC cells.
Mortalin depletion disrupts mitochondrial activity in MTC cells

Author Manuscript

Mitochondrial damages often induce cell death signals 27. Because neither TP53 nor the
MEK/ERK pathway was necessary for mortalin depletion-induced cell death, we questioned
whether mortalin depletion induced cell death by altering mitochondrial integrity in MTC
cells. To test this possibility, we first determined mortalin localization in TT and MZ-CRC-1
cells by immunofluorescence. Confocal microscopy of these cells stained for mortalin and
the mitochondrial marker, cytochrome c oxidase (COX IV), revealed highly overlapping
signals of these proteins (overlap coefficient = 0.9), suggesting that mortalin is mainly
localized in mitochondria in MTC cells (Fig. 4A).
Given this observation, we determined the effects of mortalin knockdown on mitochondrial
activity by examining mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm) using tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester perchlorate (TMRE). Upon mortalin depletion, TT cells exhibited

significantly decreased TMRE staining (Fig. 4B, upper panel), which was substantially
abolished by HAMort* overexpression (Fig. 4B, lower panel). In contrast, AZD6244 did not
affect the degree of TMRE staining in the control or mortalin-depleted cells. These data
suggest that mortalin depletion induces loss of mitochondrial membrane potential in MTC
cells, and that MEK/ERK activity is not necessary for that effect.

Author Manuscript

We next determined whether mortalin depletion could also affect the oxygen consumption
rate (OCR). In this analysis, we used different inhibitors of the electron transport chain to
determine the multiple parameters of mitochondrial function previously described 28.
Briefly, the ATPase inhibitor oligomycin allows measurement of basal OCR; the uncoupler
FCCP yields maximal OCR; and the complex III inhibitor antimycin A blocks all
mitochondrial oxygen consumption, allowing measurement of mitochondrial components of
respiration. We found that mortalin depletion substantially reduced basal as well as maximal
OCR in TT cells, which suggests decreased ATP production and mitochondrial respiratory
capacity (Fig. 4D). Moreover, our time-course analysis revealed that mortalin depletion also
significantly decreased the extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) along with decreased
basal OCR (Fig. 4E), suggesting decreased glycolytic rates. These data suggest that mortalin
is pivotal to mitochondrial activity and bioenergetics in MTC cells.
Mortalin depletion induces cell death via oxidative stress and downregulation of the bcl-2
family proteins in MTC cells

Author Manuscript

Because mitochondrial damages often initiate cell death via oxidative stress 29, we
determined whether mortalin depletion induced oxidative stress in MTC cells using the
redox-sensitive fluorescent dye, 5-(and-6)-carboxy-2’,7’-dichlorodihydrofluorescein
diacetate (carboxy-H2DCFDA). We detected significantly increased carboxy-H2DCFDA
fluorescence in mortalin-depleted TT cells (Fig. 5A). This effect was accompanied by
substantially increased lamin A cleavage but significant decreases in anti-apoptotic proteins,
Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Mcl-1 (Fig. 5B). Along with these effects, COX IV levels were also
significantly decreased upon mortalin depletion, suggesting an onset of mitochondrial stress
(Fig. 5B). HA-Mort* expression abolished all these effects, confirming that they are
mortalin depletion-specific effects (Fig. 5B).

Author Manuscript

Because the bcl-2 family proteins respond to oxidative stress 29, we suspected that oxidative
stress and subsequent decreases in the anti-apoptotic proteins may account for MTC cell
death induced by mortalin depletion. This possibility was tested by determining whether the
reactive oxygen species scavenger N-acetyl cysteine (NAC), Bcl-2 overexpression, or the
broad spectrum caspase inhibitor Z-VAD(OMe)-FMK could abrogate shMortmir effects in
TT cells. In a time-course analysis, we observed that NAC mildly delayed shMortmirinduced cleavage of PARP and lamin A (Fig. 5C, middle panel) whereas Bcl-2
overexpression substantially inhibited cleavage of these caspase substrates (Fig. 5C, right
panel). Z-VAD(OMe)-FMK also effectively blocked shMortmir-induced cleavage of PARP
and lamin A (Fig. 5D). These data strongly suggest that mortalin depletion induces caspasedependent apoptotic cell death via oxidative stress and by regulating the bcl-2 family
proteins in MTC cells.

Bcl-2 overexpression does not inhibit growth arrest induced by mortalin depletion

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

In contrast to its ability to inhibit shMortmir-induced PARP and lamin A cleavage, Bcl-2
overexpression did not inhibit shMortmir-induced E2F-1 downregulation and p27KIP1
induction in TT cells (Fig. 5C, right panel). Bcl-2 overexpression did not also affect
shMortmir-induced ERK1/2 activation (Fig. 5C), while AZD6244 inhibited shMortmirinduced E2F-1 downregulation and p27KIP1 induction irrespective to bcl-2 overexpression
(Fig. 5E). These data suggest that, contrary to its significance for cell survival, Bcl-2 is not
critical for growth arrest induced by mortalin depletion. Intriguingly, neither Bcl-2
overexpression nor Z-VAD(OMe)-FMK inhibited shMortmir-induced RET downregulation,
although it was mildly inhibited by NAC treatment (Fig. 5C and 5D). Together, these data
suggest that mortalin depletion triggers growth arrest, cell death, and RET downregulation
via distinct mechanisms, wherein the MEK/ERK pathway mediates growth arrest; the
mitochondrial apoptotic pathway mediates cell death; and RET downregulation is mediated
independently of MEK/ERK, Bcl-2, and TP53 (Fig. 5F).
Mortalin depletion effectively suppresses MTC xenografts in mice

Author Manuscript

To further evaluate mortalin as a potential therapeutic target, we examined the effects of
mortalin depletion on MTC mouse xenografts derived from TT and MZ-CRC-1 cells stably
harboring shMortmir. Administration of doxycycline significantly suppressed tumor growth,
inducing tumor shrinkage almost to the levels of complete regression in both TT and MZCRC-1 xenografts harboring shMortmir (Fig. 6A). However, doxycycline did not induce any
tumor suppressive effects in the control tumors. When doxycycline administration was
curtailed at day 20 from its initiation (thus mortalin depletion was no longer induced),
tumors began to relapse in all cases in the test groups and resumed growth at similar rates as
detected in the control groups (Fig. 6A). During this experiment, the host animals did not
exhibit any significant side effects other than the tumor-associated responses.
We also harvested MTC tumors during the doxycycline treatment (day 10) and examined
tumor homogenates by Western blotting for those aforementioned markers of growth arrest
and cell death (Fig. 6B). In both TT and MZ-CRC-1 xenografts, mortalin depletion was
accompanied by significant decreases in RET and E2F-1, and increases in p27KIP1 and
ERK1/2 phosphorylation (Fig. 6B). Importantly, these tumors also exhibited significant
lamin A cleavage and downregulation of Bcl-2 and COX IV compared to the control tumors
(Fig. 6B). These data are consistent with our in vitro data, and strongly indicate the potential
of mortalin as a novel therapeutic target for MTC treatment.

Discussion
Author Manuscript

The present study reports that mortalin upregulation may facilitate MTC cell survival and
proliferation by regulating multiple parallel independent cellular processes, including
mitochondrial metabolism, MEK/ERK signaling, RET expression, and TP53 activity.
Intriguingly, whereas transient MEK/ERK activation was necessary for mortalin depletion to
induce cell cycle arrest, the pathway was not required for cell death induction. In contrast,
mitochondrial damage was necessary for the cell death induction, but not for cell cycle
arrest. However, although regulated, TP53 was not required for mortalin depletion to induce

cell death or growth arrest. These results suggest that mortalin may regulate a wide extent of
physiological processes in cancer beyond its known role for TP53regulation, further
expanding the role of mortalin in cancer.

Author Manuscript

Mitochondria are subcellular organelles that produce energy, building blocks, and signals for
cell survival and death. These important functions of mitochondria are often dysregulated in
cancer, providing a target for therapy 27. Mortalin was mainly localized in mitochondria in
MTC cells and its depletion was accompanied by profound depolarization of mitochondrial
membrane, ROS generation, and apoptotic cell death in MTC cells. This observation
indicates that mitochondrial damages are a major mechanism underlying MTC cell death
upon mortalin depletion, suggesting the significance of mitochondrial function for MTC cell
survival. Of note, we previously demonstrated that interfering with mitochondrial
bioenergetics using the mitochondria-targeting small molecule compound, Mito-CP, could
effectively suppress growth and survival of human MTC cell lines in culture as well as in
mouse xenografts, which was accompanied by RET downregulation 30. Therefore, our
previous and current studies consistently suggest that mitochondrial targeting has potential
as a therapeutic strategy to effectively induce MTC cell death, which would be a more
desirable effect for cancer therapy. Mortalin may provide a specific target for development
of this strategy.

Author Manuscript

MEK/ERK activation was necessary for mortalin depletion to induce growth arrest, although
it was not required for cell death. We previously reported that MTC cells undergo cell cycle
arrest in response to Raf/MEK/ERK activation without any notable sign of cell death,
proposing that the pathway can function in a growth inhibitory context in MTC cells 22-26.
Our current observation of mortalin depletion effects on Raf/MEK/ERK signaling in MTC
cells continuously supports this hypothesis. By extension, it may be conceivable that
mortalin upregulation modulates Raf/MEK/ERK activity in MTC cells in the face of RET or
Ras mutations so that tumor cells may bypass growth arrest responses, which are often
associated with aberrant receptor tyrosine kinase or Ras activity 31. It may also be
conceivable that mortalin upregulation has a significant role in the reprogramming of
mitochondrial metabolism and bioenergetics in MTC. Metabolic reprogramming is currently
appreciated as an early event critical to tumorigenesis 32. As such, mortalin may facilitate
MTC cell proliferation and survival, and its overexpression may thus represent an important
selection step for MTC cells to gain a growth/survival advantage.

Author Manuscript

Increasing evidence suggests that molecular chaperones can facilitate tumorigenesis by
altering the stability or activity of important kinases and tumor suppressors 33. Although
mortalin largely shares the characteristics of HSP70 molecular chaperones 34, 35, it is
possible that mortalin may have specific clients in different cancer types. It is therefore
important to identify the effectors for mortalin function. Of note, it was reported that
mortalin serves as a key regulatory protein for the import of mitochondrial ATPase
components 36. Whether this function has a relevance to aforementioned mortalin effects in
MTC cells will have to be addressed in our future study. Likewise, it is also required to
elucidate by what mechanism mortalin is upregulated in MTC. Since mortalin is inducible
by nutritional stresses such as glucose deprivation 37, mortalin upregulation may be
attributed to an increasing demand for nutrients during MTC development. Further

elucidation of the mechanisms underlying mortalin function and its upregulation in MTC
may lead to an advanced therapeutic strategy for MTC.
In conclusion, our study characterizes mortalin as a key regulator of proliferation and
survival of MTC cells, proposing mortalin as a novel target that may provide a distinct
strategy for MTC therapy.

A and B, TT and MZ-CRC-1 cells were infected with doxycycline (dox)-inducible pTRIPZ
and pLL3.7 viruses, respectively, which harbor shRNA constructs that target different sites
on mortalin mRNA (shMortmir and shMort, respectively). Uninfected (mock)- or empty
virus-infected cells were used for comparison. Data are representing images of multiple
Western blot analyses of total lysates of TT treated with dox for indicated time and MZCRC-1 infected for 8 days. C, TT cells stably infected with pTRIPZ-shMortmir were
infected with lentiviral pHAGE expressing N-terminal HA-tagged non-shMort-targetable
mortalin mRNA (HA-Mort*). Western blot analysis of total cell lysates indicate that HAMort-shfree can abrogate mortalin knockdown effects. Empty pHAGE was used as the
control. D and E, Proliferation rates of cells in A and B were monitored by cell counting
Data (mean ±SD, n=4), *P < 0.0001. F, Viability of cells in C was monitored by 3-(4,5dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay at indicated time
points. Data (mean ±SD, n=4) are expressed as fold changes relative to the value of initial
cell culture. *P < 0.001. G and H, Cell cycle was determined in cells in A and B using
Hoechst 33342 at the treatment day 8. I, Annexin V staining of TT cells in A. Data (mean ±
SD) are from an experiment in triplicate. J, RT-PCR analysis of RET and the calcitonin
splicing variants, CT and CGRP using total RNA of TT cells in A. GAPDH was the control

analysis of TT-shMortmir cells treated with the pan-caspase inhibitor, Z-VAD(OMe)-FMK
(20 μM) during dox treatment. PARP and Lamin A are substrates of caspase 3 and 6,
respectively. E, Western blot analysis of Bcl-2-overexpressing TT-shMortmir cells treated
with 100 nM AZD6244. Total cell lysates were used for Western blotting in B to E. F,
Proposed model. Mortalin affects proliferation and survival of MTC cells by regulating the
MEK/ERK pathway and mitochondrial metabolism in MTC cells. The mechanisms by
which mortalin regulates MEK/ERK activity and mitochondrial bioenergetics is yet to be
determined. See the text for details.
