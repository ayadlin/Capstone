ABSTRACT
TGF-β1, a potent EMT (epithelial-mesenchymal transition) inducer present in the
tumor microenvironment, is involved in the metastasis and progression of various
carcinomas, including esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). TIP30 (30kDa HIV1 Tat interacting protein) is a putative tumor metastasis suppressor. Here, we found
TIP30 was decreased in cells undergoing EMT induced by TGF-β1, an occurrence that
was related to promoter hypermethylation. TGF-β1 induced TIP30 hypermethylation
via increasing DNMT1 and DNMT3A expression, which could be restored by TGF-β
antibodies. In our in vitro and in vivo studies, we showed that silence of TIP30 led
to EMT, enhanced migrative and invasive abilities of ESCC cells, promoted tumor
metastasis in xenografted mice; alternatively, overexpression of TIP30 inhibited TGFβ1-induced EMT, and metastatic abilities of ESCC cells. Mechanically, TIP30 silencing
induced the nuclear translocation and transcriptional activation of β-catenin in an
AKT-dependent manner, which further resulted in the initiation of EMT. Consistently,
TIP30 was frequently methylated and downregulated in ESCC patients. Loss of TIP30
correlated with nuclear β-catenin and aberrant E-cadherin expression. TIP30 was
a powerful marker in predicting the prognosis of ESCC. Taken together, our results
suggest a novel and critical role of TIP30 involved in TGF-β1-induced activation of
AKT/β-catenin signaling and ESCC metastasis.

INTRODUCTION

ESCC patients usually have poor prognostic outcomes that
are mainly due to metastasis and recurrence after surgery.
However, the molecular mechanisms underlying tumor
metastasis in ESCC is poorly understood.
Metastasis is a complex process involving acquires
of motility and invasiveness properties and disseminates
from primary tumors. Evidence suggests that a subset
of epithelial tumor cells acquire these properties by

Esophageal cancer, the eighth most common cancer
in the world, is composed of two main histologic types:
squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) and adenocarcinoma
(EAC) [1]. The main risk factors for ESCC, the
predominant type worldwide, include smoking and alcohol
abuse, both inflammatory insults to the esophagus [2].

of EMT-related genes and TIP30 (Fig. 1C). We found
that besides typical molecular changes of EMT, TIP30
expression was significantly decreased upon TGF-β1
treatment in ESCC cells. To correlate the endogenous
expression levels of TIP30 with the levels of TGF-β1, we
detected the mRNA expressions of TIP30 (Fig. 1D, upper)
and the secretion levels of TGF-β1 (Fig. 1D, lower) in 6
ESCC cell lines and normal esophageal mucosa cell line
Het-1A. These results reveal a strong inverse correlation
between TIP30 expression and TGF-β1 level (Spearman’s
r=0.93, P=0.03). Further, qRT-PCR and Western blots
showed that TGF-β1 decreased overall TIP30 expression
levels in both dose-dependent (Fig. 1E, left) and timedependent (Fig. 1E, right) manners in KYSE30 cells. In
contrast, mRNA expressions of TIP30 were restored in all
silenced cell line when treated with anti-TGF-β antibody
(Fig. 1F). All the above suggested that TIP30 expression
was downregulated by TGF-β1 in ESCC cells.

undergoing EMT, characterized by the loss of cell polarity,
and gain of mesenchymal differentiation properties [3,
4]. TGF-β1, a potent EMT inducer present in the tumor
microenvironment, is involved in the metastasis and
progression of various carcinomas, including gastric
[5], colorectal [6] and esophageal [7, 8] carcinoma.
TGF-β1 induces EMT through multiple distinct signaling
mechanisms [9]. In addition to its ability to activate
receptor-regulated-Smad proteins, TGF-β1 can also
engage non-Smad-dependent pathways, including the
Wnt / β-catenin, MAPK and Notch pathways, some of
which can trigger EMT programs [10-12]. However, the
underlying mechanism of how TGF-β1 activates those
pathways is still unclear.
TIP30, also called CC3 or HTATIP2, is a putative
tumor suppressor initially identified by a differential
display analysis of mRNA in highly metastatic human
variant small cell lung carcinoma (v-SCLC), versus less
metastatic classic small cell lung carcinoma (c-SCLC)
cell lines [13]. TIP30 is down-regulated in various human
tumors due to DNA methylation or posttranscriptional
regulation by miR10b [14, 15]. It’s down-regulation
associates with metastasis or poor prognosis of human
breast cancer [16], lung cancer [17], pancreas cancer [18]
and hepatocellular cancer [19]. TIP30 is able to interact
with Ets-1 and inhibit Ets-1-mediated transactivation of
osteopontin, an important molecule for tumor metastasis
in HCC [20, 21]. Recently, inhibition of the EGFR/AKT
signaling pathway by TIP30 was elucidated in breast
cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma. We previously
reported that TIP30 is downregulated during TGF-β1induced EMT and decreased TIP30 induces properties
of EMT and tumor-initiating cells to facilitate tumor
metastasis in HCC [19]. However, the precise mechanism
of how TGF-β regulates TIP30 expression remains
unclear. Here, we are able to characterize the methylated
regulation of TIP30 by TGF-β1, as well as the critical role
of TIP30 involved in TGF-β1-induced activation of AKT/
β-catenin signaling and ESCC metastasis.

TIP30 was frequently
downregulated in ESCC

and

There is a typical CpG island spanning the
transcription start site of TIP30 (Fig. 2A), as we described
previously [15]. To explore whether hypermethylation of
TIP30 is involved in the decreased expression of TIP30,
we examined the methylation status of TIP30 in 6 ESCC
cell lines and normal esophageal mucosa cell line Het1A (Fig. 2B). Methylation-specific PCR (MSP) results
showed that the TIP30 promoter was unmethylated in
normal esophageal mucosa cell Het-1A and KYSE30
cells which had abundant TIP30 mRNA expression. In
contrast, TIP30 was completely methylated in KYSE150
cells, which had undetectable TIP30 expression. Partial
methylation of TIP30 was found in the remaining ESCC
cells, which had both methylated and unmethylated alleles.
To confirm the MSP results, we further examined TIP30
promoter methylation by conducting bisulfite genomic
sequencing (BGS) analysis of 18 individual CpG sites
within its CpG island (Fig. 2B lower). The result revealed
that promoter of TIP30 was frequently methylated in
ESCC cells. ESCC cell lines with methylated TIP30
were treated with DNA demethylating agent 5-Aza2’dC, and then MSP and QRT-PCR were performed. The
results showed that treatment with 5-Aza-2’dC decreased
the methylated MSP products (Fig. 2C) and increased
TIP30 mRNA expression (Fig. 2D). Together, these data
demonstrate that hypermethylation of CpG islands results
in epigenetic silence of TIP30 in ESCC cell lines.
To investigate the methylation status of TIP30 in
human ESCC specimens, MSP was performed in 85 cases
of ESCC tissues (T) and 8 cases of normal esophageal
mucosa tissues (N, Fig. 2E). The methylation of TIP30
was 62/85 (72.9%) in the tumor tissues and only 1/8
(12.5%) in the normal esophageal mucosa tissues. The
methylation status of TIP30 was further confirmed by BGS

RESULTS
TIP30 was negatively correlated with TGF-β1 in
ESCC cells
TGF-β1 is a classic EMT inducer in many types
of epithelial tumors, including ESCC. As shown in Fig.
1A, KYSE30 and KYSE450 cells had an epitheliallike morphology. After treatment with TGF-β1, cells
underwent a morphologic change from a cobblestone-like
cell morphology to a spindle-like, fibroblastic morphology,
accompanied with increased cell invasion and migration
ability (Fig. 1A and 1B). To better characterize TGFβ1-induced EMT, we examined the mRNA expressions

hypermethylated in ESCC specimens.

TGF-β1 silences TIP30 expression by inducing promoter
methylation.
To further explore the mechanisms by which
TGF-β1 promotes methylation of TIP30, we analyzed
expression of DNMTs. The mRNA expression of DNMT1
and DNMT3A were unchanged after TGF-β1 treatment
(Fig. 3C). However, the protein expression of DNMT1 and
DNMT3A were increased upon TGF-β1 treatment in both
dose-dependent and time-dependent manners in KYSE30
(Fig. 3D, left and middle). In contrast, the anti-TGF-β
antibody decreased DNMT1 and DNMT3A expression
in KYSE450 and KYSE150 (Fig. 3D, right). To confirm
the roles of DNMT1 or DNMT3A on TIP30 expression,
specific siRNA against DNMT1 and DNMT3A were
used. The results showed that the silencing of DNMT1 or
DNMT3A restored TIP30 expression in TGF-β1 treated
cells (Fig. 3E and F). These data suggest that TGF-β1
promotes methylation of TIP30 by increasing expression
of DNMT1 and DNMT3A.

TGF-β1 promoted TIP30 methylation through
inducing DNMTs expression
To investigate the effects of TGF-β1 on TIP30
methylation, we treated ESCC cells with TGF-β1 or antiTGF-β antibody before extracting the genomic DNA and
subjecting it to MSP analysis. The results showed that
TGF-β1 induced a decrease in unmethylated promoter
alleles and an increase in methylated promoter alleles
in KYSE30 cells (Fig. 3A, left). In contrast, anti-TGF-β
antibody suppressed TIP30 methylation in KYSE450 and
KYSE150 cells (Fig. 3A, right). The decreased expression
of TIP30 by TGF-β1 was independent of canonical
TGF-β1 signaling, since siRNA-mediated knockdown
of Smad3 did not restore TIP30 expression upon
TGF-β1 treatment (Fig. 3B). The results confirmed that

and right). All of these results demonstrate that decrease
of TIP30 plays an important role in TGF-β1-induce EMT
in ESCC cells.
KYSE30 cells were infected with lentivirus
expressing shNon or shTIP30 to establish KYSE30-shNon
and KYSE30-shTIP30 cells respectively. Cells were then
injected into the flanks of nude mice (n=6 per group).
Compared to non-specific RNA interference, knockdown
of TIP30 significantly enhanced the growth and invasion
of tumor cells (Supplemental Fig. 2) Furthermore,
H&E staining and IHC staining for TIP30, Vimentin
and E-cadherin were performed on tumor sections. A
clear boundary between the tumor and its adjacent nontumor tissue was often observed in KYSE30-shNon cells
generated tumors. However, irregular tumor invasion
with a decreased E-cadherin expression and an increased
Vimentin expression were observed in tumors induced
by KYSE30-shTIP30 cells (Fig. 4D). The in vivo data
confirms our in vitro observations that a loss of TIP30
promotes the cell invasion and EMT in ESCC.
To further elucidate the inhibitory effects of TIP30
on tumor metastasis, both experimental and spontaneous
metastasis assays were used. KYSE30-shTIP30 and
KYSE30-shNon cells were intravenously injected into
nude mice. After 8 weeks, the mice were euthanized
and the lungs and livers were harvested. The number of

The effects of TIP30 in TGF-β1-regulated EMT and
metastatic potential were determined both in vitro and in
vivo. KYSE30 cells were transfected with siRNA against
TIP30. Silencing TIP30 led to morphologic changes,
from square-like epithelial to spindle-like mesenchymal
phenotype (Fig. 4A upper). Moreover, E-cadherin
expression was decreased, whereas the vimentin
expression was increased in the TIP30-depleted cells (Fig.
4B left and Supplemental Fig. 1A). EMT phenotype was
also observed in KYSE30 cells stably expressing TIP30
short hairpin RNA (shRNA) (Supplemental Fig. 1B and
C). On the other hand, KYSE450 cells were infected
with the Lv-TIP30 or Lv-Non control virus and then
treated with TGF-β1 or BSA for 48h. Overexpression of
TIP30 blocked TGF-β1-induced EMT as determined by
examination of cell morphology, expression of E-cadherin
and Vimentin (Fig. 4A lower and Fig. 4B right). Migration
and invasion assay showed that knockdown of TIP30
resulted in a clear and potent migrative and invasive
phenotype in KYSE30 cells (Fig. 4C left). In the contrast,
overexpression of TIP30 may reduce TGF-β1-induced
increases in cell invasion and migration (Fig. 4C middle

metastatic nodules on the surface of the lungs and livers
was significantly higher in mice injected with KYSE30shTIP30 cells than in mice injected with KYSE30-shNon
cells (Fig. 4E, lower). Histological studies confirmed that
the lesions were caused by extravasation and subsequent
tumor growth of KYSE30 cells into the lungs and livers
(Fig. 4E, middle). Meanwhile, KYSE150 cells infected
with Lv-TIP30 or Lv-Non control virus were injected
subcutaneously into each mouse. Spontaneous metastasis
assays showed that overexpression of TIP30 significantly
reduced the incidence of lung metastases in nude mice

(Fig. 4F). Since the tumors displayed severe liquefactive
necrosis, the volume was not detected. All the above
revealed that TIP30 negatively regulates tumor metastasis
in ESCC in vivo.

adhesion, both also mediates transcriptional activation. A
high-magnification picture of β-catenin staining showed
downregulation of TIP30 promoted β-catenin to become
disassociated from cell contacts and become translocated
into the cytosol. Overexpression of TIP30 inhibits
TGF-β1-induced redistribution of β-catenin (Fig. 5A).
Consistent with the in vitro experimental results, cytosol
and nucleus staining of β-catenin were found in KYSE30shTIP30 cells generated tumors, while the control tumors
showed a membranous staining of β-catenin (Fig. 5B).
Because the cytoplasmic relocalization of β-catenin results
in an increased pool of the protein that is able to move to
the nucleus and stimulate transcription [22], we examined
the transcriptional activation of the β-catenin reporter,
TOP-flash. As expected, TIP30 silence sharply increased
β-catenin-dependent transcriptional activity. Conversely,

overexpression of TIP30 suppressed TGF-β1-induced
activation of β-catenin (Fig. 5C). Previous study shows
that β-catenin targets the Vimentin and ZEB1 genes for
their transcription during EMT [23, 24]. In our study,
TIP30 regulates Vimentin expression but not ZEB1 in
ESCC (Supplemental Fig. 1A). To confirm the importance
of β-catenin in increased expression of Vimentin induced
by TIP30 silence, siRNA against β-catenin was used.
The results showed TIP30 silence-induced Vimentin
expression was significantly blocked in β-catenin-depleted
cells (Fig. 5D). To underlie the regulatory mechanism of
β-catenin activity by TIP30, the phosphorylation status of
β-catenin was examined via western blots with indicated
antibodies (Fig. 5E). GSK-3β mediated phosphorylation of
S33/37 did not change upon TIP30 depletion or TGF-β1
treatment. However, AKT mediated phosphorylation of

S552 was significantly increased after TIP30 depletion
and TGF-β1 treatment. Furthermore, TGF-β1 mediated
β-catenin phosphorylated at S552 was blocked by TIP30
overexpression. The results indicate that TIP30 inhibits
phosphorylate of β-catenin at S552 and suppresses
activation of β-catenin. Recent reports suggest that a
TIP30 protein complex regulates EGFR endocytosis,
resulting in the inhibition of AKT activation [25, 26].
Phosphorylation and activity of AKT were also detected,
as shown in Fig. 5E. TIP30 silence significantly increased
AKT activation, and overexpression of TIP30 inhibits
TGF-β1 mediated AKT activation. Furthermore, blockage
of AKT by MK-2206 attenuated TIP30 decrease-induced
activation of β-catenin and upregulation of Vimentin (Fig.
5F). Together, we conclude that decreased expression
of TIP30 facilitates TGF-β1-mediated AKT/β-catenin
activation.

epithelial cells, TIP30 showed intense staining mainly in
the nucleus just above basal cell layer. In the tumor cells,
TIP30 staining was mainly detected in the cytoplasm and
significant weaker than that in the normal epithelial cells.
Mann-Whitney U test revealed that the immunostaining
score of TIP30 was highest in the adjacent normal mucosa
and lowest in the metastatic lymph nodes (Fig. 6B).
On the basis of the TIP30 expression in tumor
cells, 137 patients with ESCC were divided into two
groups: the high-expression (n =68) and low-expression
group (n = 69). The correlations of TIP30 expression
and clinicopathologic features were further analyzed.
TIP30 expression was inversely associated with the depth
of tumor invasion (P=0.002), lymph node metastasis
(P=0.042) and advance stage (P=0.002). However, there
was no significant correlation between TIP30 expression
with age, gender, tumor location, tumor differentiation or
distant metastasis (Table 1).
Moreover, we also detected β-catenin and E-cadherin
expression levels in the ESCC tissues and paired adjacent
normal mucosa (Fig. 6A), in the normal epithelial cells,
β-catenin and E-cadherin showed unequivocal and
strong membranous staining just above basal cell layer,
whereas, in the basal cell layer, β-catenin located mainly

Reduced TIP30 expression predicted a poor

nucleus positive staining of β-catenin and 69.3% (95/137)
had aberrant E-cadherin protein expression with negative
staining or less than 70% membranous staining. We found
loss of TIP30 correlated with nuclear β-catenin, and
aberrant E-cadherin expression (P<0.001, Mann-Whitney
U test, Fig. 6C).
The potential associations between TIP30 expression
and overall survival (OS) evaluated in the 137 patients
included in the present study. Log-rank test showed that
ESCC patients with low TIP30 expression experienced
poor overall survival (OS) than patients with high TIP30
expression (median survival time, 29 months vs. 49
months; P < 0.001; Fig. 6E). By univariate analysis, tumor
differentiation, TNM stage and TIP30 low expression were
prognostic factors for OS. Nevertheless, multivariate
analysis showed that downregulation of TIP30 and tumor
differentiation were 2 independent prognostic predictors
for ESCC patients enrolled in this study (Supplemental
Table 1). Thus, decreased expression of TIP30 may serve
as a prognostic indicator for patients with ESCC.

expression of DNMT1/3B in HCC cells [30]. DNMT1
has been implicated primarily in the maintenance of
methylation patterns that occurs during cellular replication
and preferentially methylates hemimethylated DNA[31].
We demonstrate that TIP30 can be methylated by TGF-β1
via up-regulation of DNMT1 and DNMT3A. TGF-β1
did not change the mRNA expression of DNMT1 and
DNMT3A, but increased their protein level directly, this
may be the reason that methylation and downregulation of
TIP30 occurred at early time phases. However, it remains
unclear how TGF-β1 regulates DNMTs protein levels. It
has reported posttranslational modifications of acetylation
and ubiquitination, as well as regulation of micoRNA
were involved in expression regulation of DNMTs. The
regulation of TIP30 expression by TGF-β1 implies a
potential role of TIP30 in TGF-β1-mediated biological
functions.
During cancer progression, TGF-β1 frequently
switches from tumor suppressor to tumor promoter [32,
33]. Oncogenic signals may blunt TGF-β-induced growth
arrest and apoptosis, while enhancing TGF-β-induced proinvasive and pro-metastatic responses [11, 34, 35]. This
may involve a change in the balance between canonical
SMAD signaling and non-SMAD signaling [12]. Our
results shows that in ESCC cells, TGF-β1 induces a
typical EMT phenotype accompany with increased
cell invasion and migration. Further, we found downregulation of TIP30 may also initiate EMT and increase
properties of metastasis, but over-expression of TIP30 may
partially inhibit TGF-β1-induced EMT and pro-metastatic
responses. The results indicate that TGF-β1-induced EMT
and pro-metastatic responses were mediated partially by
silence of TIP30. We also demonstrate that TIP30 may
inhibit phosphorylation and activation of β-catenin. Our
data shows that silence of TIP30 facilitates TGF-β1mediated activation of AKT/β-catenin signaling, which
subsequently induces EMT and pro-metastatic responses.
Our findings present the inhibition effects and the
underlying mechanism of TIP30 in tumor metastasis and
EMT, and also provide new insights into the molecular
mechanisms of TGF-β1-mediated tumor progression.

DISCUSSION
TGF-β1, a potent EMT inducer present in the
tumor microenvironment, is involved in the metastasis
and progression of many types of carcinomas including
esophageal carcinoma. TIP30 is a putative tumor
metastasis suppressor and its expression and function
in ESCC remains unknown. This study reveals a novel
unique modulatory role of TIP30 in TGF-β-mediated EMT
and tumor metastasis in human esophageal cancer.
Here we found that TIP30 expression was negatively
correlated with TGF-β1 in ESCC cells. TGF-β1 decrease
TIP30 expression levels in both dose-dependent and
time-dependent manners. So far, we know less about
the regulation mechanism of TIP30. Previous studies
have suggested that the expression of TIP30 could be
activated by JAK/STAT3 pathway or suppressed by
DNA methylation and mir-10b. It was reported that
Sorafenib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), decreased
expression of TIP30 via JAK/STAT3 signaling in HCC
[27]. In PDAC, TIP30 is a direct target of mir-10b. A
typical CpG island is found in the promoter of TIP30 and
TIP30 is frequently metylated in hepatocarcinoma and
breast cancer [15, 16]. We examined methylation status
of TIP30 in ESCC cell lines and ESCC patients to find
that TIP30 is also frequently hypermethylated in both
ESCC cell lines and ESCC patients. Furthermore, the
methylation statutes of TIP30 are positively correlated
with the levels of TGF-β1 in ESCC cell lines. A recent
study suggested that TGF-β1 also plays an important and
controversial role in the regulation of DNA methylation.
TGF-β1 may increase DNMT1/3A expression and cause
nuclear translocation of DNMT1/3A in prostate cancer and
kidney fibrogenesis [28, 29]. TGF-β1 may also decrease

DNA Extraction and Methylation-Specific PCR
(MSP) Analysis
Genomic DNA was extracted from 5×106 cells or
10 mg tissue using QIAamp DNA Mini Kit (Qiagen).
Genomic DNA was treated with sodium bisulfite has been
described [36]. DNA (5 μg) was denatured in 33 μl of
0.3 mol/L NaOH at 37°C for 15 minutes, without using
restriction endonuclease. Denatured DNA was mixed
directly with 333 μl of bisulfite solution and treated in
darkness. The bisulfite solution was prepared as either
2.4 mol/L sodium metabisulfite (pH 5.0–5.2) (SigmaAldrich)/0.5 mmol/L hydroquinone (Sigma-Aldrich)
for a 4-hour treatment 31 or 3.1 mol/L sodium bisulfite
(pH 5.0–5.2) (Sigma-Aldrich)/0.5 mmol/L hydroquinone
for a 16-hour treatment. DNA was desalted and purified
using the QIAEX II Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen). DNA
was then treated with 0.3 mol/L NaOH at 37°C for 15
minutes and precipitated with 3 mol/L ammonium acetate
and 3 volumes of ethanol. Recovered DNA was purified
again then dissolved in 20–50 μl of TE buffer (pH 8.0)
and stored at −20°C. MSP was performed using Taq
Gold polymerase (Applied Biosystems) as described
previously. MSP products were subcloned into pGEM-T
Vector (Promega) and transformed into Escherichia coli.
Candidate plasmid clones were sequenced by Huada
Scientific (Beijing, P.R. China).

RNA extraction and reverse transcription PCR
Total RNA was isolated using Trizol reagent
(Invitrogen). First-strand cDNA was generated using
the PrimeScript RT reagent Kit (TAKARA). Analysis of
mRNA levels was performed on a 7500 Fast Real-Time
PCR System (Applied Biosystems) with SYBR Greenbased real-time PCR. Actin was used as an endogenous
control to normalize the amount of total RNA in each
sample. The primer sequences can be obtained from
Supplemental Table 3.

Western Blots
Total cell lysate was prepared in 1×SDS buffer.
Proteins at the same amount were separated by SDSPAGE and transferred onto PDVF membranes. After
probing with individual antibodies, antigen–antibody
complex was visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence’s
reagents Supersignal (Pierce Biotechnology). The
primary antibodies specific against E-cadherin, Vimentin,
DNMT1, DNMT3A, p-S552-β-catenin and p-S33/37-βcatenin were from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly,
MA); the β-catenin antibody was from BD Biosciences
(SanJose, CA), the GAPDH antibody was from Kangchen
Biothechnology Company (Guangzhou, P.R. China); the
TIP30 antibody was described previously [17].

Quantification of TGF-β1
ESCC cells were cultured in fresh serum-free
media for 24 hours, and then total TGF-β1 in the cell
culture supernatant was measured by specific enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (Peprotech).
TGF-β1 concentration was normalized to number of cells,
determined by cell counting with a hemocytometer. Data
are expressed as pg/ml of TGF-β1 per 105 cells.

Transwell Migration and Invasion Assay
Transwell migration assays were quantified in vitro
using Transwell chambers with polycarbonate membrane
filters (8 μm pore size; Corning) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. In brief, the lower chamber
was filled with 0.6 ml medium containing 20% fetal
bovine serum and 0.2ml of medium that contained 3×105
cells under serum-starving conditions was plated in the
upper chamber and incubated at 37°C for 48 hours. Then
cells that had not migrated were removed from the upper
face of filters using cotton swabs. The cells that migrated
through the membrane and attached to the bottom of the

membrane were fixed and stained with crystal violet.
Images of five random fields were captured from each
membrane and the number of migratory cells was counted,
and the extent of migration was expressed as the average
number of cells per microscopic field at a magnification of
100. The mean of triplicate assays for each experimental
condition was used. Similar inserts coated with Matrigel
(Chemicon) were used to determine invasive potential
in invasion assay. Two independent investigators were
blinded when reading the migration and invasion assays.

Immunohistochemical

A total of 93 tissue specimens, including 8 cases
of normal mucosa and 85 cases of ESCC, used in MSP
analysis were acquired from the Pathology Department
of the Medical College of Shantou University (Shantou,
P.R.China), collected from 2007 to 2009. This study
was approved by the ethical committee of the Tumor
Hospital of Shantou University Medical College. The
tissue specimens used in IHC staining had been removed
from 137 patients with ESCC who had undergone surgery
at The 150 hospital of Chinese PLA (Luoyang, Henan,
P.R.China) between 2001 and 2005. Patient consent and
approval from the 150 Hospital of Chinese PLA Ethics
Committee was obtained in order in advance for research
purposes. Cancer sample was taken from the tumor tissue
where there was no hemorrhage or putrescence, whereas
the matched normal mucosa was taken from the surgical
cutting edge, which was approximately 3–5 cm away
from the cancerous lesion. The expression of TIP30,
β-catenin and E-cadherin proteins in the specimens was
detected with an immunohistochemistry assay. Details of
Immunohistochemistry were described previously [17].
Evaluation of immunostaining was independently
conducted by 2 experienced pathologists. The expression
of TIP30 was scored according to the signal intensity and
distribution, details described previously [18]. Tissues
with immunohistochemical scoring ≤4 were considered as
low expression and with scoring 5-12 as high expression.
The expression of TIP30 was evaluated according to the
percentage of stained nuclei, independently of intensity.
Positive staining was defined as 20% or greater nucleic
staining of the population of cells examined [37].
E-cadherin expression was scored as either normal
(junctional) or aberrant, as previously described. Aberrant
staining was defined as either negative staining or less
than 70% membranous staining of the population of cells
examined. Normal staining was defined as 70% or greater
membranous staining of the study population [38].

TOP-flash luciferase assays
ESCC cells were cotransfected with pTOP-flash
or pFOP-flash and Renilla vector (pRL-TK) using
Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) in triplicate. After 24
hours cells were treated with or without 5 μM of TGF-β1
for 48 hours. The cells were then lysated and analyzed
with the Dual Luciferase Kit (Promega) on a Centro
XS 3 LB 960 (Berthold Technology GmbH & Co KG).
pTOP-flash and pFOP-flash plasmids were gifts from
Dr. Mingzhou Guo (Department of Gastroenterology
& Hepatology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing,
China).

Animal experiments
Male Balb/c nude mice at 6 week-old were housed
under standard conditions and cared for according to
the institutional guidelines for animal care. All animal
experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of PLA General
Hospital. For the tumorigenicity assay, KYSE30 cells
were infected with LV-shTIP30 and LV-shNon at
MOI 20 and 5×106 cells were injected subcutaneously
into each mouse (n = 6 mice / group). The mice were
monitored over the course of the experiment and
euthanized for histopathology examination at day 28
after cells inoculation. The tumors volume was calculated
according to the formula: V =length × width2 × 0.5. For
experimental metastasis assay, each experimental group
(shTIP30 and shNon) consisted of 5 mice. Briefly, 1 × 106
cells were injected intravenously through the tail vein into
each mouse. After 8 weeks, the mice were euthanized,
the presence of tumor nodules was macroscopically
determined and the number of tumor nodules formed on
the lung/liver surfaces was counted. The lungs and livers
were excised and embedded in paraffin for histopathology
examination. For the spontaneous metastasis assay,
KYSE150 cells were infected with LV-TIP30 and LV-Non
at MOI 20 and 5×106 cells were injected subcutaneously
into each mouse (n = 6 mice / group). After 8 weeks,
mice were euthanized and examined for development of
pulmonary metastasis under microscope.
