Long-Term Outcomes in the Second-Line
Treatment of Chronic Myeloid Leukemia
A Review of Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors
Elias Jabbour, MD, Jorge Cortes, MD; and Hagop Kantarjian, MD

Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a progressive and often fatal myeloproliferative neoplasm. The hallmark of CML is
an acquired chromosomal translocation known as the Philadelphia chromosome (Ph), which results in the synthesis
of the breakpoint cluster region-Abelson murine leukemia (BCR-ABL) fusion oncoprotein, a constitutively active tyrosine kinase. The introduction of imatinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) that is specific for BCR-ABL, was a major
breakthrough in CML therapy. Although most patients respond to first-line imatinib therapy, some experience loss of
response (resistance) or require treatment discontinuation because of toxicity (intolerance). For patients with CML,
failure on standard-dose imatinib therapy (400 mg daily), imatinib dose escalation (600-800 mg daily) is a secondline option. However, high-dose imatinib is not an appropriate approach for patients who experience drug toxicity,
and there remain questions over the durability of responses achieved with this strategy. Alternative second-line
options include the TKIs dasatinib and nilotinib. A substantial amount of long-term data for these agents is available.
Although both are potent and specific BCR-ABL TKIs, dasatinib and nilotinib exhibit unique pharmacologic profiles
and response patterns relative to different patient characteristics, such as disease stage and BCR-ABL mutation status. To optimize therapeutic benefit, clinicians should select treatment based on each patient’s historic response,

Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a progressive and often fatal myeloproliferative neoplasm with an incidence of

approximately 1 to 2 cases per 100,000 adults.1 The natural history of CML consists of 3 distinct stages: an initial chronic
phase (CP), an intermediate accelerated phase (AP), and a terminal blast phase (BP).2 Most patients (90%) present with
CML in CP, which is a relatively slowly progressing stage characterized by well differentiated leukemic cells.3,4 AP follows
CP and involves poor control of white blood cell counts and increasing numbers of immature blasts in the peripheral
blood.4 After 1 to 2 years, AP transitions into BP, resulting in cytopenias, infections, bleeding, organ failure, and death.4
Approximately 66% of patients with CP eventually go on to develop BP,5 and the transition occurs as rapidly as 3 years in
the absence of treatment.2 The median survival for patients with untreated BP CML is 3 to 6 months.4
The hallmark of CML is an acquired mutation, initially described in 1960, called the Philadelphia chromosome
6,7
(Ph). This mutation results in a balanced translocation between the Abelson murine leukemia (ABL) gene of chromosome
9 and the breakpoint cluster region (BCR) gene of chromosome 22 (t[9;22][q34;q11]).3 In virtually all cases, the resultant
BCR-ABL gene encodes a fusion protein.3 The BCR-ABL fusion protein contains a constitutively active tyrosine kinase
region of ABL that deregulates cell growth, motility, angiogenesis, and apoptosis, leading to the development of leukemia.8
The transition from CP to advanced stages is not well understood but is believed to involve escalating genetic instability.4 The increased rate of cellular proliferation elicited by BCR-ABL may result in the acquisition of additional chromosomal abnormalities, a process known as clonal evolution.3,4 The prevalence of clonal evolution increases with
advancing CML stage, rising from 30% in AP to as much as 80% in BP.9

Review Article

Given the central role of BCR-ABL in the pathogenesis of CML, inhibiting BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase activity through targeted therapies represents a viable
therapeutic strategy.4 The advent of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) designed to abrogate the oncogenic function
of BCR-ABL has greatly improved the treatment of CML
judged against the historically used interferon-alpha
(IFN-a) treatment.4 Before the introduction of TKIs,
IFN-a was the therapy of choice for CML despite the limited durability of responses (complete cytogenetic
responses [CCyR] were maintained in just 5% to 25% of
patients using this therapy).10
TKIs are orally administered agents that compete
with adenosine triphosphate (ATP) for its binding site on
ABL, leading to inhibition of tyrosine phosphorylation of
the proteins involved in BCR-ABL signal transduction
and ultimately resulting in apoptosis of the cancer cell.11-13
The first TKI to be approved by the US Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) for the first-line treatment of
CML was imatinib mesylate (Gleevec; Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation, East Hanover, NJ).4 Imatinib is
indicated for patients with newly diagnosed, Ph-positive
CML in CP and for patients with Ph-positive CML in
BP, in AP, or in CP after failure on IFN-a therapy.14 Recommended doses depend on the CML phase: Imatinib
400 mg daily is approved for patients with CP CML,
whereas imatinib 600 mg daily is approved for patients
with CML in AP or BP.
The clinical activity of imatinib was demonstrated
in the pivotal phase 3 International Randomized Study of
Interferon Versus STI571 (IRIS) trial, which compared
imatinib with IFN-a plus low-dose cytarabine in 1106
patients with newly diagnosed CML in CP.10 Imatinib,
versus IFN-a plus cytarabine, yielded significantly better
rates of a major cytogenetic response (major cytogenetic
response [MCyR] rate, 87% vs 35%; P < .001) and
CCyR (76% vs 14%; P < .001) after 18 months of treatment. The progression-free survival (PFS) rate for patients
with CML in AP or BP also was significantly better with
imatinib compared with IFN-a plus cytarabine (97% vs
91%; P < .001). Responses with imatinib were durable.
At 8 years of follow-up, the event-free survival rate was
81%, The PFS rate for patients with CML in AP or BP
was 92%, and the estimated overall survival (OS) rate at 8
years was 85% (93% when only CML-related deaths and
deaths before stem cell transplantation [SCT] were considered).15 Imatinib was well tolerated, and the adverse
events were mostly mild or moderate in intensity. After a
median follow-up of 60 months, the most commonly

898

reported adverse events were edema (including peripheral
and periorbital edema; 60%), nausea (50%), muscle
cramps (49%), musculoskeletal pain (47%), diarrhea
(45%), rash and other skin problems (40%), fatigue
(39%), abdominal pain (37%), headache (37%), and
joint pain (31%).16 Grade 3 or 4 adverse events consisted
of neutropenia (17%), thrombocytopenia (9%), anemia
(4%), and elevated liver enzymes (5%).16 Although firstline imatinib therapy is tolerated well, patients should be
monitored for potential serious adverse events, such as
edema and severe fluid retention, hematologic toxicity,
congestive heart failure, and hepatotoxicity.14
Some patients who are receiving imatinib experience
primary (intrinsic) or secondary (acquired) resistance.4
Primary resistance has been defined as the failure to
achieve a landmark response after starting treatment.17
According to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines, primary resistance is defined as
the failure to achieve hematologic remission within 3 to 6
months of treatment initiation, any level of cytogenetic
response at 6 months, an MCyR at 12 months, or a
CCyR at 18 months.18 The European LeukemiaNet
(ELN) recommendations define treatment failure similarly as less than hematologic remission within 3 months,
no cytogenetic response within 6 months, less than a partial cytogenetic response (PCyR) within 12 months, and
less than a CCyR within 18 months.19 In the IRIS trial,
primary resistance, as evidenced by a lack of CCyR at 18
months, occurred in 24% of patients.10 Secondary resistance is defined as disease progression and loss of therapeutic effect while continuing on an imatinib regimen that
previously had resulted in a response.4 In a 5-year followup of the IRIS trial, secondary resistance occurred in 24%
of patients (recurrence rate, 17%; progression rate, 7%).16
Imatinib resistance is attributed to several mechanisms.20 Point mutations in the BCR-ABL oncogene are
the most common cause of imatinib resistance, particularly secondary resistance, and occur in 35% to 70% of
patients with resistance.20-22 These mutations can change
the conformation of the BCR-ABL protein without significantly impairing its function and may induce a shift in
the equilibrium of the BCR-ABL oncoprotein from the
inactive form, which imatinib binds, to the active form,
which imatinib is unable to bind.20 BCR-ABL kinase domain mutations can occur either spontaneously or as a
result of selective pressure, in which continued imatinib
treatment eliminates sensitive leukemic cells and selects
for resistant mutant cells. Other possible mechanisms of
imatinib resistance include BCR-ABL gene amplification

and the development of alternative pathways of disease
progression that are not targeted by imatinib, such as the
SRC family kinases (SFKs).
Another important clinical barrier to the use of imatinib is drug toxicity leading to the discontinuation of
treatment, also referred to as intolerance.4 After 7 years,
5% of patients in the IRIS trial discontinued therapy
because of adverse events.23 In a retrospective review of a
managed care database (n ¼ 216), imatinib therapy was
suspended because of drug toxicity in 29% of patients,
most often because of anemia (11%) or thrombocytopenia
(11%).24 Furthermore, among patients in that analysis
who suspended therapy, 26% had to discontinue treatment
with imatinib permanently. Intolerance to imatinib occurs
more frequently in advanced stages of CML, which is likely
to be the result at least in part of the heightened morbidity
in late-stage disease.25-27 A further consideration is that
patients with advanced-stage CML tend to receive higher
doses of imatinib than patients with CML in CP—the
approved doses for CML in AP/BP and CML in CP are
600 mg daily and 400 mg daily, respectively.14 In the retrospective database review discussed above, the percentages of
patients requiring a dose reduction who had starting doses
of at least 400 mg daily, 600 mg daily, or 800 mg daily
were 21%, 59%, and 67%, respectively.24
Imatinib dose escalation (600-800 mg daily) is a second-line therapeutic strategy for patients with CML after
failure on standard-dose, first-line imatinib therapy.4 The
rationale for using second-line, high-dose imatinib therapy is supported by the results from a phase 1 dose-seeking trial (n ¼ 83) that revealed a direct association
between higher doses of imatinib and observed
responses.11 Several studies of high-dose imatinib in
patients with CML and failure on standard-dose, frontline imatinib have reported cytogenetic responses in 30%
to 50% of patients. However, those investigations also
indicated that the best responses attained were lost in 40%
to 50% of patients and that treatment-related outcomes
were not consistent among all patients.4,28-31 Recent data
have suggested that this option should be reserved for
patients with minimal disease burden, ie, cytogenetic recurrence rather than hematologic recurrence.4 High-dose
imatinib is associated with increased myelosuppression.4
Current NCCN guidelines and ELN recommendations indicate that alternative TKI therapies should be
considered for patients who develop resistance or intolerance to imatinib.18,19 Approved second-line TKIs include
dasatinib (Sprycel; Bristol-Myers Squibb Company,
Princeton, NJ)32 and nilotinib (Tasigna; Novartis Phar-

evaluated these TKIs and provide guidance to clinicians
for the therapeutic selection of a second-line TKI.

DASATINIB
Dasatinib is a potent BCR-ABL TKI with 325-fold
greater in vitro selectivity for unmutated BCR-ABL than
imatinib.34,35 In addition to blocking BCR-ABL kinase
activity, dasatinib inhibits a distinct spectrum of oncogenic kinases, including SFKs, c-Kit, platelet-derived
growth factor-receptor (PDGFR), and ephrin-A receptor.36 Moreover, unlike imatinib, which only binds to the
inactive conformation of the ABL kinase domain, dasatinib binds to both the active and inactive conformations.34-37 Dasatinib is active in vitro against all imatinibresistant BCR-ABL mutations, with the exception of the
threnoine-to-isoleucine mutation at codon 315 (T315I)
‘‘gatekeeper’’ mutation.1,34,35 Because of its greater potency than imatinib, dasatinib also may have activity in
patients with imatinib resistance caused by BCR-ABL
overexpression.37 The effect of dasatinib on alternative
signaling pathways (eg, SFKs) may enable it to overcome
BCR-ABL-independent resistance to imatinib.37
Dasatinib was approved by the FDA in 2006 for the
treatment of imatinib-refractory CML in all phases and
Ph-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).32 Approval was granted based on the efficacy and safety outcomes demonstrated in the open-label, phase 2 v-src
sarcoma (SRC)/ABL Tyrosine Kinase Inhibition Activity:
Research Trials of Dasatinib [START]) studies in patients
with CML or Ph-positive ALL that was resistant or intolerant to first-line imatinib therapy.31,38-41
Significant efficacy in patients with CML in CP
who received second-line dasatinib 70 mg twice daily was
evident in the START-C phase 2 study (n ¼ 387).42 The
2-year CCyR rate was 53%, and the median time to
achieve these responses was 5.5 months. In addition, confirming response durability, 90% of CCyRs were maintained after 24 months. The 2-year PFS and OS rates were
80% and 94%, respectively.43
The START-R study compared responses to dasatinib 70 mg twice daily with responses to high-dose imatinib (400 mg twice daily) in 150 patients with CML in CP
who had already experienced resistance to imatinib 400 to
600 mg daily.31 At the 2-year follow-up, dasatinib demonstrated significantly higher rates of CCyR (44% vs 18%; P
¼ .0025). Rates of complete hematologic response (CHR),
MCyR, major molecular response (MMR), and PFS also

899

favored dasatinib (P < .05). This superiority over highdose imatinib also was durable. After 18 months, the
MCyR was maintained in 90% of dasatinib-responding
patients compared with 74% of imatinib-responding
patients. In addition, the START-A, START-B, and
START-L studies demonstrated that dasatinib 70 mg twice
daily possessed a high level of clinical activity and generally
was well tolerated in patients who had CML in AP, CML
in BP, and Ph-positive ALL, respectively.38,39,41,44
On the basis of data from the START trials, the recommended starting dose for dasatinib initially was 70 mg
twice daily for all indications. However, based on additional evidence from dose-optimization studies, the dasatinib prescribing information recently was updated to
include new recommended starting doses of 100 mg once
daily for patients with CML in CP and 140 mg once daily
for patients with CML in AP, CML in BP, or Ph-positive
ALL.45-49 The CP CML dose-optimization study (n ¼
670) evaluated 4 different dosing schedules: 100 mg once
daily, 50 mg twice daily, 140 mg once daily, and 70 mg
twice daily45 Marked and comparable hematologic and
cytogenetic response rates were observed across the 4 treatment groups. In particular, dasatinib 100 mg once daily
was as effective as the previously recommended dose of
70 mg twice daily. After a minimum follow-up of 6
months, the 100-mg once-daily and 70-mg twice-daily
regimens yielded similar rates for MCyR (59% vs 55%,
respectively) and CCyR (41% vs 45%, respectively). The
durability of cytogenetic responses to the 100-mg oncedaily regimen was confirmed over long-term follow-up:
CCyR rates were 39%, 45%, and 50% at 6 months, 12
months, and 24 months, respectively.46 At 36 months,
the PFS and OS rates were 73% and 87%, respectively. In
total, 36 patients experienced progression events while
receiving dasatinib 100 mg once daily (n ¼ 164). The majority of patients (86%) who progressed while receiving
dasatinib remained in CP at 36 months.50
Also noteworthy was the finding that the 100-mg
once-daily regimen was tolerated better than the 70-mg
twice-daily regimen, with significantly lower rates of pleural effusion (all grades, 7% vs 16%; P ¼ .024) and grade 3
or 4 thrombocytopenia (22% vs 37%; P ¼ .004). The
most common hematologic adverse events of any grade
reported with dasatinib 100 mg once daily included anemia
(89%), neutropenia (63%), and thrombocytopenia (60%).
Common nonhematologic adverse events were headache
(30%), diarrhea (23%), fluid retention (21%), and fatigue
(20%). Fewer patients who were receiving dasatinib 100
mg once daily experienced dose interruption (51% vs

900

68%), reduction (30% vs 55%), or discontinuation (16%
vs 23%) after a 6-month minimum follow-up.
The other phase 3, dose-optimization study compared a 140-mg once-daily dose of dasatinib with the 70mg twice-daily dose in patients (n ¼ 611) with CML in
AP, CML in BP, or Ph-positive ALL who were resistant or
intolerant to imatinib.47-49 Among patients with CML in
AP who were randomized to receive once-daily or twicedaily treatment, the 2-year rates were comparable for
major hematologic response (66% vs 68%, respectively)
and MCyR (39% vs 43%, respectively).47 The once-daily
and twice-daily regimens also were similar with regard to
the 24-month PFS (51% vs 55%, respectively) and OS
(63% vs 72, respectively). The once-daily regimen was
associated with an improved safety profile compared with
the twice-daily regimen. Significantly fewer patients who
were receiving once-daily treatment experienced a pleural
effusion (all grades: 20% vs 39%; P < .001). Likewise, in
subsets of patients with CML in BP and Ph-positive ALL
who were followed for 2 years in this phase 3 study, both
schedules were associated with similar efficacy, but significantly fewer adverse events and treatment interruptions
were noted with once-daily treatment.48,49
Because accumulating evidence attests to the high
activity of dasatinib as second-line therapy for CML,
research efforts are beginning to focus on reasons for dasatinib resistance. It is believed that progression of CML
involves additional cytogenetic abnormalities (eg, trisomy
8, trisomy 19, and isochromosome 17q).9 Clonal evolution confers imatinib resistance51,52 and is an independent
poor prognostic factor for survival51 and a significant predictor for hematologic recurrence and inferior PFS.52 Little is known about the impact of clonal evolution on
second-line treatment with dasatinib. A small study (n ¼
71) of patients with any phase of CML who were receiving
second-line dasatinib demonstrated that cytogenetic
responses were compromised among the 31% of patients
with clonal evolution (n ¼ 22) after a median follow-up
of 9 months.53 MCyR was attained in 14% of patients
with clonal evolution, compared with 42% of those without clonal evolution. These findings underscore the
potential importance of clonal evolution in CML resistance and point to the need for additional larger studies.
The relation between BCR-ABL mutations and dasatinib
resistance is explored below.
The recommended treatment option for patients
who fail second-line TKI treatment is allogeneic hematopoietic SCT.19 Currently, treatment with nilotinib after
dasatinib failure is not recommended; however, it is the

subject of an ongoing phase 2 study.54 After a median follow-up of 12 months in patients who had previously failed
on both imatinib and dasatinib, nilotinib elicited an
MCyR rate of 43% in 39 patients with CML in CP and a
confirmed hematologic response rate of 29% in 17 evaluable patients with CML in AP. Estimated OS rates are
86% at 18 months in patients with CML in CP and 80%
at 12 months in patients with CML in AP.

NILOTINIB
Another TKI that can be used in CML after failure with
first-line imatinib is nilotinib.4 Approved by the FDA in
2007 for treating patients with Ph-positive CML in CP
and AP (but not CML in BP or Ph-positive ALL) who are
resistant or intolerant to imatinib,33 nilotinib is an imatinib analog with 30 times more potency than imatinib at
in vitro BCR-ABL inhibition.13,34 Other kinase targets
for nilotinib include PDGFR and c-Kit receptors.4 Nilotinib is active against all imatinib-resistant BCR-ABL
mutations except T315I.55 Like imatinib, nilotinib binds
an inactive conformation of ABL but may overcome most
BCR-ABL mutants through its greater potency.37 In a 24month update, nilotinib produced a CCyR in 44% of
patients with CML in CP who had failed on imatinib.56
The rate of PFS in this population was 64%.57
The recommended dose for nilotinib is 400 mg
administered twice daily approximately 12 hours apart.33
Food should not be ingested for at least 2 hours before
and for at least 1 hour after the dose is taken, because food
increases the bioavailability of nilotinib.
The clinical activity of nilotinib in the setting of
imatinib-resistant or imatinib-intolerant CML was demonstrated in 2 pivotal, open-label, single-arm, phase 2
studies, including 1 study in patients with CML in CP
and another study in patients with CML in AP.56,58 The
CP CML trial involved 321 patients who were imatinib
resistant (30%) or imatinib intolerant (70%) and had a
minimum follow-up of 19 months.56 An MCyR was
achieved in 59% of patients at a median of 2.8 months,
and a CCyR was achieved by 44% of patients at a median
of 3.3 months. Responses were durable, with 78% and
83% of patients maintaining MCyRs and CCyRs, respectively, at 24 months. The OS rate was 88% at 24 months.
At 2-year follow-up, treatment had been discontinued in
59% of participants because of disease progression (27%),
drug-related adverse events (15%), or other reasons
(17%).59 The AP CML trial involved 137 patients who
were imatinib resistant (80%) or imatinib intolerant
Cancer

(20%) and had a minimum follow-up of 11 months.58 A
CHR was achieved in 31% of patients at a median of 1
month after the initiation of therapy, and an MCyR was
achieved in 32% of patients at a median of 2.8 months. A
CCyR was achieved in 20% of patients, and >70% of
those patients remained in CCyR at 24 months. The OS
rate was 67% at 24 months.
Among patients with CML in CP, nilotinib was
well tolerated and had a favorable risk-benefit profile.56
The most common grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormalities
were elevated lipase (17%), hypophosphatemia (16%),
hyperglycemia (12%), and elevated total bilirubin (8%).
Grade 3 or 4 nonhematologic adverse events were infrequent, with rash, headache, and diarrhea occurring in
2% of patients. The most common grade 3 or 4 hematologic adverse events were neutropenia (31%), thrombocytopenia (31%), and anemia (10%). Pleural or
pericardial effusions (all grades) occurred in 2% of
patients, and grade 3 or 4 pleural or pericardial effusions
were rare (<1%).
Currently, treatment with an additional TKI is not
recommended after failure on second-line TKI therapy, as
stated above. However, a study in 23 patients (19 of
whom were in advanced stages of CML) who failed on
both imatinib and nilotinib demonstrated that dasatinib
induced a CHR rate of 43% and a cytogenetic response
rate of 30%, including 2 CCyRs and 1 PCyR.60 Another
case study has indicated that dasatinib may overcome
BCR-ABL mutation-independent resistance in patients
who are resistant to both imatinib and nilotinib.61

IMPLICATIONS FOR THE CLINIC
TKIs have shifted the treatment paradigm for CML,
offering patients effective and well tolerated therapeutic
options. Standard-dose imatinib (400 mg daily) is the
only currently approved front-line TKI therapy for
patients with CML. Most patients respond to first-line
imatinib therapy, but resistance and intolerance occur in
some patients. For patients who have treatment failure
with imatinib, second-line options should be explored.
Dose escalation of imatinib in the second line is not an
appropriate approach for patients who experience drug
toxicity, as mentioned above. NCCN guidelines indicate
that dasatinib and nilotinib should be considered in
patients with resistance or intolerance to imatinib.18 Both
are potent and specific BCR-ABL TKIs, yet each has distinct pharmacologic properties that should be considered
when planning second-line therapy.

Substantial long-term efficacy data are now available
for TKIs administered as second-line therapy for CML
(Table 1), although prospective randomized trials comparing dasatinib with nilotinib have not been performed.
Dasatinib and nilotinib are highly effective and have been
approved for the treatment of patients with CML in CP
or AP who are resistant or intolerant to imatinib therapy,
inducing rapid and durable hematologic and cytogenetic
responses. Dasatinib also is effective and has been
approved for the treatment of patients with CML in BP
and patients with Ph-positive ALL who are resistant or
intolerant to imatinib therapy. Twenty-four-month data
from separate trials revealed MCyR rates for dasatinib and
nilotinib at the currently recommended doses of 63% and
59%, respectively, among patients with CML in CP56,62
and 39% and 32%, respectively, among patients with
CML in AP.31,58 The 24-month OS rates for dasatinib
and nilotinib were 91% and 88%, respectively, among
patients with CML in CP56,62 and 63% and 67%, respectively, among patients with CML in AP.31,58

Making cross-trial comparisons of response and outcome between dasatinib and nilotinib can be problematic
and difficult to interpret. Study design characteristics,
such as inclusion criteria and definitions of response and
progression, vary between the clinical trials that have evaluated these agents. For instance, in a multicenter phase 2
study of dasatinib, a CHR was determined based on
patients who attained or maintained a CHR regardless of
prior response with imatinib.40 However, in multicenter
studies of nilotinib, a CHR was assessed only in patients
who did not have a CHR at baseline.63 Furthermore, the
phase 3 dose-optimization trial of dasatinib also enrolled
patients who had a suboptimal response to imatinib,
whereas large trials of nilotinib did not include that population.45 These differences also extend to the criteria for
intolerance, such that large studies with dasatinib considered patients with grade 3 or 4 toxicity as imatinib intolerant regardless of their cytogenetic response. Nilotinibspecific trials excluded patients who had a prior MCyR to
imatinib in the intolerant population. Finally, the definition of progression also has differed between multicenter
dasatinib-specific and nilotinib-specific trials. Progression
in dasatinib studies traditionally has included the loss of
hematologic or cytogenetic response, increasing white
blood cell count, a sizeable increase in Ph-positive metaphases, transition to advanced phases of CML, or death.
Progression in nilotinib studies is defined only by transition to advanced phases of CML or death. Because the
progression reported in dasatinib-focused studies is
defined more strictly, resulting in a lower PFS rate, many
patients who are classified as progressing with dasatinib
would not fall under that category in nilotinib studies.
This suggests that the survival outcomes with these 2
agents should monitored as important endpoints.
In addition to efficacy outcomes, mutational data
should be considered when selecting TKI therapy.4 The
BCR-ABL genotype can be used to guide treatment decisions, because it is a prognostic factor for disease progression.64-67 Patients with the threnoine-to-alanine/
isoleucine mutation at codon 315 (T315A/I), the phenyalanine-to-isoleucine/leucine mutation at codon 317
(F317I/L), and the valine-to-leucine mutation at codon
299 (V299L) do not appear to respond consistently to
therapy with dasatinib4,65,66; whereas patients with the
phenylalanine-to-cysteine/valine substitution at codon
359 (F359C/V) do benefit from dasatinib.4,40 In an analysis of 1043 patients who underwent mutational assessment in phase 2/3 studies of CML in CP, 14 patients had
baseline F317L mutations, and only 1 patient had a

baseline V299L mutation.68 Those investigators observed
that patients with F317L mutations achieved a high CHR
rate (93%), but cytogenetic response rates (MCyR, 14%;
CCyR, 7%) were lower than in patients without these
mutations. It is noteworthy that, among patients who
received dasatinib, high response rates were obtained with
the common imatinib-resistant mutations in Y253, E255,
and E359 residues.
Nilotinib resistance is associated with mutations in
the T315, Y253, and E255 residues.4 Indeed, recently, it
was demonstrated that the presence of E255K/V, Y253H,
or F359C/V mutations at baseline were independent predictors of worsened PFS in patients with CML in CP.69
Therefore, dasatinib therapy may be more appropriate for
patients with these common mutations, whereas nilotinib
may be better suited for those with F317L mutations.4
Although both dasatinib and nilotinib are ineffective
against T315I BCR-ABL,4 this mutation is more likely to
affect patients in the advanced phases of CML.22,70
Patients with T315I may achieve favorable outcomes with
therapies other than the available second-line TKIs, eg,
AP24534, omacetaxine, and others.4
Safety and tolerability also are important considerations in choosing a TKI, especially among patients with
certain comorbidities. Serious cases of pleural effusion can
occur with dasatinib therapy but are more common in
advanced phases (grade 3 or 4: 2% with CML in CP and
7% with CML in AP).31,62 Because both imatinib and
nilotinib rarely are associated with pleural effusion (1%
incidence),14,33 these agents may be more appropriate
therapies for patients with pulmonary disease or with a
high susceptibility to pleural effusions.4 At currently recommended doses, grade 3 or 4 myelosuppression may be
similar for nilotinib and dasatinib. In patients with CML
in CP, grade 3 or 4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia
were observed in 35% and 23% of patients who were
receiving dasatinib, respectively, after a minimum 2 years
of follow-up.62 For nilotinib, grade 3 or 4 neutropenia
and thrombocytopenia were induced in 31% of patients
who were receiving nilotinib after a minimum follow-up
of 19 months.57 Serious bleeding events (eg, intracranial
and gastrointestinal bleeding) have been reported with
the use of TKIs, and clinicians as well as patients should
be vigilant for warning signs.14,32,33 With dasatinib,
bleeding has been noted particularly among patients
with CML in AP/BP and low platelet counts.71 QT
interval prolongation has occurred on rare occasions
with nilotinib and dasatinib.32,33 Therefore, it is recommended that all patients who are receiving nilotinib and

Cancer

March 1, 2011

dasatinib should be screened for risk factors of QT prolongation (eg, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, congenital long QT syndrome, and concurrent medications that
can lead to QT prolongation).18 There is a strict predose
and postdose fasting requirement with nilotinib,
because food substantially alters the drug’s bioavailability, which may increase the risk for QT interval prolongation.33 Nilotinib is the only TKI that carries a blackbox warning.4
In conclusion, TKIs have revolutionized the treatment of CML, rapidly becoming standards of care. Imatinib, as the first approved TKI for front-line treatment of
patients with CML, has changed the natural history of
CML. However, resistance and intolerance are challenges
faced by some patients who receive imatinib, and there is
a need for alternative treatments. Current guidelines support the use of dasatinib or nilotinib as second-line therapy among patients with CML who fail on first-line
imatinib therapy. The efficacy and safety of dasatinib and
nilotinib as second-line therapy have been confirmed by
substantial long-term outcome and response durability
data, and it is clear that these agents exhibit unique pharmacologic profiles and response patterns relative to different patient characteristics, such as disease stage and BCRABL mutation status. To optimize therapeutic benefit,
clinicians should select a second-line TKI while keeping
these considerations in mind.
