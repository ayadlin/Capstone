Abstract:

Elucidating the response of breast cancer cells to chemotherapeutic and hormonal
based drugs is clearly important as these are frequently used therapeutic approaches.
A signaling pathway often involved in chemo- and hormonal-resistance is the Ras/
PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR cascade. In the studies presented in this report, we have
examined the effects of constitutive activation of Akt on the sensitivity of MCF7 breast cancer cells to chemotherapeutic- and hormonal-based drugs as well as
mTOR inhibitors. MCF-7 cells which expressed a constitutively-activated Akt-1 gene
[∆Akt-1(CA)] were more resistant to doxorubicin, etoposide and 4-OH-tamoxifen
(4HT) than cells lacking ∆Akt-1(CA). Cells which expressed ∆Akt-1(CA) were
hypersensitive to the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin. Furthermore, rapamycin lowered
the IC50s for doxorubicin, etoposide and 4HT in the cells which expressed ∆Akt-1(CA),
demonstrating a potential improved method for treating certain breast cancers which
have deregulated PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR signaling. Understanding how breast
cancers respond to chemo- and hormonal-based therapies and the mechanisms
by which they can become drug resistant may enhance our ability to treat breast
cancer. These results also document the potential importance of knowledge of the
mutations present in certain cancers which may permit more effective therapies.

Introduction

resistance to anticancer agents [1]. The HER2 growth
factor receptor is frequently amplified in human breast
cancer and is a target of diverse therapeutic approaches
as well as an important biomarker [2-4]. Among the
signaling pathways downstream of these and other
receptors, the PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR and Ras/Raf/
MEK/ERK pathways have been shown to regulate growth
and prevent apoptosis and their deregulation is often
implicated in malignant transformation [5-12]. These

Growth factor receptors are critical for controlling
the proliferation of cells. Once activated, these receptors
induce multiple signaling pathways involved in growth,
prevention of apoptosis, differentiation and other
fundamental processes. The epidermal growth factor
(EGF) receptor (EGFR) and isoforms such as HER2
are also associated with breast cancer development and

and sensitivity to targeted therapy.
A consequence of impaired PTEN expression is
elevated activation of Akt. Elevated Akt activity can have
many effects on cell growth, such as; the phosphorylation
and activation/inactivation of transcription factors which
control pivotal gene expression, the inactivation of
anti-apoptotic molecules by their phosphorylation and
subsequent protesomal degradation, or by the regulation
of translation of key “weak” mRNAs involved in growth.
One downstream molecule of mTOR is ribosomal S6
kinase (p70S6K). This kinase regulates the efficiency
of translation of certain mRNAs and also functions
in a negative feedback loop to control Akt activity
[10,44,54-55]. The roles of Akt and p70S6K and other
molecules are essential for the formation of the eIF4F
translation complex. The eIF4F complex is necessary
for the translation of mRNAs containing long 5’UTRs
which are highly-structured and have an elevated G+C
content. These mRNAs are considered “weak” mRNAs.
These “weak” mRNAs often encode genes involved in
oncogenesis and survival such as c-Myc, Mcl-1, cyclin-D,
VEGF and survivin. Furthermore p70S6K has important
roles in autophagy and cellular senescence [56].
Akt, mTOR and p70S6K activation have been
associated with a more severe prognosis in breast and
other cancers [53,57-64]. Targeting the PI3K/PTEN/Akt/
mTOR pathway may prove effective in various cancer
therapies [12,54,65-66]. High levels of activated Akt
expression have been associated with both chemo- and
hormonal resistance in breast cancer [58-59,67]. Indeed
some studies have evaluated the effectiveness of targeting
mTOR in PTEN-negative cells [60]. Cells which express
high levels of activated Akt may be more sensitive to
mTOR inhibitors and inhibition of mTOR activity by
rapamycin may restore their sensitivity to chemo- and
hormonal based therapies [9,60]. A distinct advantage to
targeting mTOR with rapamycin is that rapamycin has
been used many years to treat organ transplant patients
(especially kidney transplant). Rapamycin is now being
examined in treatment of certain cancers and in the
prevention of aging and other diseases including AIDS
[11-12,68].
Previously it was determined that mutated forms
of Akt and PTEN can induce chemotherapeutic- and
hormonal-based drug resistance in breast cancer [9,58,67].
PTEN mutation which eliminate lipid phosphatase activity
will result in activated Akt expression which will lead to
drug resistance and sensitivity to the mTOR inhibitor
rapamycin [9].
In the following studies, the effects enforced
expression of activated Akt-1 on drug resistance and
sensitivity to targeted therapy. Inhibitors targeting mTOR
suppressed drug resistance demonstrating the importance
of mTOR in chemosensitivity. These experiments
were performed to understand the effect of common
chemotherapeutic drugs on anti-apoptotic signaling

pathways also play key roles in the genesis of cancer
initiating cells (CICs, a.k.a. cancer stem cells) [13-22].
The PI3K/PTENAkt/mTOR pathway is frequently
activated by mutations which may alter sensitivity to
targeted therapy. The PI3K p110 catalytic subunit gene
(PIK3CA) is one of the most frequently mutated genes
in breast cancer [23]. Mutations in the kinase domain of
PIK3CA will result in activation of Akt and contribute
to malignant transformation, however the roles of
these mutations in sensitivity to traditional chemo- and
hormonal- based therapies and targeted therapies are not
so well elucidated [24-26].
The regulation of Akt activation is complex. Akt is
a key domino in determining whether a cell will survive
and proliferate, undergo apoptosis or senescence [2740]. Phosphatidylinositol (PI) (3,4)P2 and PI(3,4,5)P3
produced by class 1A PI3Ks recruit phosphoinositide
dependent kinase-1 (PDK1) as well as Akt isoforms to
the plasma membrane by interacting with their pleckstrin
homology (PH) domains [41-44]. Co-localization of
PDK1 with Akts at the plasma membrane causes PDK1
to phosphorylate Akts at a threonine residue (T308) and
a serine residue (S473). The kinase which phosphorylates
S473 is believed to be mTORC2, which actually is the
rapamycin-insensitive complex which lies downstream
of Akt [44]. Activation of PDK1 and Akt by class 1A
PI3Ks is negatively regulated by phosphatase and tensin
homologue deleted on chromosome ten (PTEN) [7, 9,
44-48]. PTEN removes phosphate groups from PI(3,4)P2
and PI(3,4,5)P3 added by PI3K as well as from tyrosine
phosphorylated proteins including focal adhesion kinase
(FAK) and Shc [7,11,44]. PTEN is a critical tumor
suppressor gene and another key lynch-pin in regulation
of this pathway. PTEN is frequently inactivated by various
genetic mechanisms which results in Akt activation.
Diverse mechanisms regulate PTEN expression
[10,47-50]. These range from gene deletion, alterations
in mRNA splicing, subcellular localization or epigenetic
mechanisms which prevent PTEN transcription. There
are many microRNAs (miRNAs) which target the PTEN
gene to inhibit its expression [10,47,51]. Furthermore
there is a pseudo PTEN gene which serves as a decoy
to bind and neutralize some of these miRNAs [10,47].
Mutations have been reported to occur at PTEN in breast
cancer at varying frequencies (5-21%). While PTEN is
deleted in certain cancers, loss of heterozygosity (LOH)
is probably a more common genetic event (30%) leading
to changes in PTEN expression [47,52]. PTEN promoter
methylation leads to low PTEN expression [47]. In one
study, 26% of primary breast cancers had low PTEN
levels which correlated with lymph node metastases and
poor prognoses [53]. PTEN has both plasma membrane
and nuclear localized activities. Disruption of PTEN
activity by various mechanisms frequently results in Akt
activation. Activation of Akt could have vast effects on
different processes affecting breast cancer drug resistance

MCF7/∆Akt-1(CA) cells did not show any difference in
sensitivity to paclitaxel than the parental MCF-7 cell line

We also isolated ∆Akt-1(CA) cells with increased
resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs by culturing the cells
for 4 weeks in medium containing 25 nM doxorubicin.
These cells were named MCF7/∆Akt-1(CA)DoxR and
they were 5-fold more frequently recovered from cells
infected with the ∆Akt-1(CA)-containing virus than from
control cell lines. The MCF7/∆Akt-1(CA)DoxR cells
were 6.7- and 3.1-fold more resistant to doxorubicin and
etoposide respectively than control MCF-7 cells (Figure

Results
Effects of Constitutively-Activated Akt-1
Expression on the Sensitivity of MCF-7 Cells to
Chemotherapeutic Drugs
A means to examine the effects of deregulated
Akt-1 expression on the sensitivity of MCF-7 cells to
chemotherapeutic- and hormonal-based drugs is to infect
MCF-7 cells with a retrovirus encoding a constitutivelyactive Akt gene such as ∆Akt-1(CA) [69]. Pools of
∆Akt-1(CA)-infected MCF-7 cells were recovered after
selection in medium containing G418 as that is the
drug that the neoR gene present in the retroviral vector
encodes resistance to. The ∆Akt-1(CA)-infected cells
are named MCF7/∆Akt-1(CA). The sensitivities of these
cells to chemotherapeutic drugs were determined by
MTT analysis after incubation for 4 days in the indicated
culture conditions. Figure 1 illustrates the sensitivities of
the MCF-7 and MCF7/∆Akt-1(CA) cells to doxorubicin,
etopside and paclitaxel. As an additional control, similar
experiments were performed with MCF-7 cells transfected
with the empty neor plasmid, pEGFP (MCF7/EGFP).
These cells represent a control for cells transfected with
just a neoR gene. MCF7/EGFP cells were similar in drug
sensitivity as MCF-7 cells.
Initially, the ∆Akt-1(CA)-infected cells were about
2- and 1.5-fold more resistant to doxorubicin (Figure 1,

selected MCF-7/∆Akt-1(CA)DoxR cells were 2.5-fold
more sensitive to rapamycin than the MCF-7/∆Akt1(CA) cells. Thus introduction of activated Akt-1
into MCF-7 cells conferred increased sensitivity to

DoxR cells were even more sensitive to rapamycin.

The abilities to improve chemotherapy by potentially

particular experiment presented in Figure 3, Panel A, we
added a constant dose of 50 nM 4HT and different doses
of doxorubicin to examine the effects on MCF7/∆Akt1(CA) cells. It should be pointed out that 4HT by itself,
like rapamycin, did not totally eliminate viability of the
cells after 4 days of incubation, as approximately 25%
relative growth was still observed (Figure 2, Panels A &

The effects of the hormonal drug 4-hydroxytamoxifen

ER+ MCF-7 and Akt-transduced cells ranged from
7 to 200 nM (Table 1). The MCF7/∆Akt-1(CA) cells
were approximately 4.3-fold more resistant to the
effects of 4HT than MCF-7 cells. The MCF7/∆Akt1(CA)DoxR cells were approximately 10-fold more
resistant the effects of 4HT than MCF-7 cells (Table
1). Thus constitutive Akt-1 expression elevated the
concentration of 4HT required to achieve the IC50.

Combinatorial effects on 4HT IC50s were observed
with rapamycin in MCF-7, MCF7/∆Akt-1(CA) and
MCF7/∆Akt-1(CA)DoxR cells (Table 2). The highest
level of rapamycin-mediated suppression of the 4HT IC50s
was observed with the MCF7/∆Akt-1(CA)DoxR cells
although rapamycin-mediated suppression of the 4HT
IC50s was also observed in doxorubicin sensitive MCF-7
cells. Thus rapamycin is able to synergize with 4HT in
these ER+ cells (Table 2).

B). In contrast, high concentrations of doxorubicin (>500
nM) almost totally eliminated the relative growth of the
cells at sufficient concentrations (Figure 1). As shown in
Figure 3, Panel A, addition of 50 nM 4HT reduced the
doxorubicin IC50 approximately 10-fold. Moreover, when
the doses of doxorubicin required for essentially total
cell death (>95% inhibition) were examined, a 2-fold
lower dose of doxorubicin was required (250 vs 500 nM
doxorubicin) when 4HT was added than in its absence.
Next we examined the effects of a constant, suboptimal dose of 5 nM 4HT on the doxorubicin IC50s
in MCF-7, MCF-7/∆Akt-1(CA), and MCF-7/∆Akt1(CA)DoxR cells. 7.5-, 10.7- and 8.9-fold decreases
in the IC50 for doxorubicin were observed (Table 2).
These results indicated that suppressing the ER could
promote the cytotoxic effects of doxorubicin at lower
concentrations. Moreover, even though the MCF7/∆Akt-1(CA) cells required more 4HT to reach the
IC50 than MCF-7 cells, they remained sensitive to 4HT

Discussion

Effects of mTOR Inhibitors on Sensitivity of
MCF-7 Cells to Doxorubicin

In our studies, we examined the effects of three
chemotherapeutic drugs (doxorubicin, etoposide and
paclitaxel), one hormonal drug (tamoxifen, 4HT) and
the signal transduction inhibitor rapamycin on MCF-7
and derivative cell lines which varied in their levels of
activated Akt-1 expression. An advantage of our study
is that all the cells had the same genetic background as
they all were MCF-7 breast cancer cells, however they
differed in the levels of activated Akt-1 expression due to
introduction of an activated Akt-1 gene.
We have previously shown that introduction of

MCF-7 cells were more sensitive to doxorubicin
than MCF7/∆Akt-1(CA) cells (Figure 4, Panel A).
However, low doses of rapamycin had greater effects on
the doxorubicin IC50s in MCF7/∆Akt-1(CA) than in MCF7 cells. Essentially a constant dose of 1 nM rapamycin
did not reduce the IC50 for doxorubicin in MCF-7 cells
(Figure 4, Panel B), while it did reduce the IC50 for
doxorubicin in MCF7/∆Akt-1(CA) cells to approximately
the same IC50 level observed in MCF-7 cells (Panel C).

MCF-7 cells were more sensitive to etoposide
than MCF-7/∆Akt-1(CA)DoxR cells (Figure 5, Panel
A). Rapamycin was able to lower the concentration of
etoposide required to reach the IC50 in the MCF-7/∆Akt1(CA) and MCF-7/∆Akt-1(CA)DoxR cells (Figure
5 and Table 2). Usually a higher degree of interaction
was observed in the MCF-7/∆Akt-1(CA)DoxR cells. The
results of addition of 1 nM rapamycin on the etoposide
IC50s in MCF-7 and MCF-7/∆Akt-1(CA)DoxR cells are
presented in Panel B. Rapamycin suppressed the etoposide
IC50s the most in the MCF-7/∆Akt-1(CA)DoxR cells, with
approximately a 2-fold reduction as compared to MCF-7
cells (Table 2). 1 nM rapamycin did not suppress the IC50s
of etoposide in MCF-7 cells (Panel C), but did suppress
the IC50 for etoposide in MCF-7/∆Akt-1(CA)DoxR cells
approximately 2.5 fold (Panel D).
Rapamycin also suppressed the 4HT IC50s in the
doxorubicin-sensitive and resistant- cells (Table 2). The
highest level of rapamycin-mediated suppression of the
4HT IC50s was observed with the MCF-7/∆Akt-1(CA)
DoxR cells although rapamycin-mediated suppression of
the 4HT IC50s was also observed in doxorubicin-sensitive
MCF-7 cells.

dominant negative (DN) forms of PTEN into MCF-7
cells conferred resistance to doxorubicin and increased
sensitivity to rapamycin [9]. Furthermore, rapamycin
could synergize with doxorubicin to lower its IC50 [9]. In
the MCF-7 cells transfected cells with the DN PTEN genes,
increased levels of activated Akt were detected. However,
these drug-resistant PTEN(DN) transfected cells were
hypersensitive to rapamycin. These results have clinical
significance as the PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR pathway is
often activated in breast cancer by mutations at PIK3CA
or multiple genetic mechanisms leading to dysregulation
of PTEN. Furthermore, drug resistance frequently
develops in breast cancer after chemo- or hormonal-based
therapies. Doxorubicin (a.k.a Adriamycin) is frequently
used to treat breast cancer patients. In the studies present
in this report, increased expression of activated Akt1 resulted in the resistance of MCF-7 breast cancer

cells to both chemotherapeutic drugs (doxorubicin and
etoposide) as well as hormonal based drugs (4HT) and
these drug resistant activated Akt-1 overexpressing cells
were also hypersensitive to rapamycin, which reduced
the concentrations of doxorubicin, etoposide and 4HT
required to reach the IC50s in these cells.
The roles of Akt and downstream mTOR are critical.
Hyperactivation of mTOR will induce cellular senescence
which can be inhibited by mTOR inhibitors. mTOR
appears to be an essential switch which stimulates p53 to
promote cellular quiescence vs. senescence. [70-75].
Doxorubicin, etoposide and paclitaxel all have
been used to treat breast cancer. However, doxorubicin
and paclitaxel are more commonly employed in breast
cancer therapy today than etoposide [76]. Tamoxifen is
a common hormonal-based drug used to treat ER+ breast
cancer. After chemotherapeutic drug and hormonal based

drug treatment of breast cancer patients, resistance will
develop [10,77]. Thus it is essential to develop new more
effective and alternative methods to treat breast cancer.
Doxorubicin, etoposide and paclitaxel can all be
transported by the same drug transporter (Mdr-1, a.k.a.,
Pgp, and ABCB1) [78]. Our results suggest that Mdr1 is
not likely to be involved in the drug resistance of these
cells but our studies do not exclude many other drug
transporters. Both doxorubicin and etoposide target events
involved in DNA replication, whereas paclitaxel targets
microtubules. Therefore it is not surprising that cells
selected for resistance to doxorubicin are also resistant
to etoposide, but not paclitaxel. Our studies suggest that
attention should be given during treatment of breast
cancer patients who have become resistant to a particular
chemotherapeutic drug, as these patients may be crossresistant to other chemotherapeutic drugs which target
similar events.
Interestingly, suboptimal doses of 4HT would
interact with doxorubicin to lower the doxorubicin IC50
in MCF-7, MCF-7/∆Akt-1(CA), and MCF-7/∆Akt-1(CA)
DoxR approximately 8- to 10-fold. This demonstrates the
important effects of 4HT on ER cells. Even though cells
that express activated Akt require more 4HT to reach the
IC50 than cells which do not express activated Akt, they
will still respond to 4HT when they are also treated with
doxorubicin. Thus resistance to doxorubicin does not
prevent a response to 4HT.
The mechanisms by which doxorubicin and
rapamycin synergize to inhibit the growth of breast cancer
cells are under further investigation. Doxorubicin can
induce reactive oxygen species (ROS) which have many
effects on cell growth and the prevention of apoptosis.
A consequence of doxorubicin treatment may be the
induction of the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway which may have
some anti-apoptotic effects [79].
The ability of a 1 nM constant addition of the mTOR
inhibitor rapamycin to interact with 4HT and lower the
IC50 for 4HT was observed in MCF-7 and MCF-7/∆Akt1(CA) cells. In contrast, 1 nM rapamycin did not increase
the sensitivity of MCF-7 cells to either doxorubicin or
etoposide. Higher doses of the mTOR inhibitor were
not examined in these studies as 1 nM rapamycin was
close to the IC50s previously observed in the cell lines. 1
nM rapamycin was sufficient to increase the sensitivity
of MCF-7/∆Akt-1(CA) cells and not MCF-7 cells to
doxorubicin and etoposide.
These results are relevant to potential cancer
therapies as Akt is frequently activated by upstream
PIK3CA or PTEN mutations or gene silencing. PTEN can
be mutated or silenced by various mechanisms in human
cancer. Mutations occur which either delete the PTEN gene
or alter its activity. Sometimes these mutations actually
make the cells sensitive to Akt and mTOR inhibitors as
the growth of the cells becomes dependent upon elevated
Akt levels and downstream mTOR and p70S6K activities

Materials and Methods
Cell Culture
MCF-7 cells were obtained from the American
Type Culture Collection (ATCC) (Manassas, VA). Cell
culture medium for MCF-7 cells consisted of Roswell
Park Memorial Institute-1640 (RPMI 1640) medium
(Invitrogen. Carlsbad CA) supplemented with 10% (v/v)
heat inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) as described
[5].

Akt Plasmids
MCF-7 cells were infected with a retrovirus encoding
the ∆Akt-1(CA) gene [69,80]. Stably ∆Akt-1(CA)infected or EGFP-transfected MCF-7 cells were isolated
after growth for 4 weeks in selective drug (2 mg/ml G418,
Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) as described [9,80].

Analysis of Sensitivity to Drugs and Signal
Transduction Inhibitors.
Cells were seeded in 96-well cell culture plates (BD
Biosciences) at a density of 5,000 cells/well in 100 µl/well
of phenol red free RPMI-1640 containing 5% charcoal
stripped (CS) FBS as described [5]. Cells were incubated
for 1 day to permit cells to adhere to the bottom of each
well. Cells were subsequently treated with serial 2-fold
dilutions of the chemotherapeutic drugs (doxorubicin,
etoposide or paclitaxel), the hormonal drug (4HT), signal
transduction inhibitor, rapamycin, (all purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich) or a constant suboptimal concentration of
the hormonal drug or signal transduction inhibitor. Cells
were incubated for an additional 4 days at 37 °C until
extent of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-2Htetrazolium bromide (MTT, Sigma-Aldrich) reduction in
each well was quantified at 530 nm [5].
