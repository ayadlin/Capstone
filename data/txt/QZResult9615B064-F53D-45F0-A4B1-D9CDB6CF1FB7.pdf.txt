Despite evidence that long-term smoking is the leading risk factor for pancreatic malignancies, the
underlying mechanism(s) for cigarette-smoke (CS)-induced pancreatic cancer (PC) pathogenesis
has not been well-established. Our previous studies revealed an aberrant expression of the MUC4
mucin in PC as compared to the normal pancreas and its association with cancer progression and
metastasis. Interestingly, here we explore a potential link between MUC4 expression and
smoking-mediated PC pathogenesis and report that both cigarette-smoke-extract (CSE) and
nicotine, which is the major component of CS, significantly up-regulates MUC4 in PC cells. This
nicotine-mediated MUC4 overexpression was via α7 subunit of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor
(nAChR) stimulation and subsequent activation of the JAK2/STAT3 downstream signaling
cascade in cooperation with the MEK/ERK1/2 pathway; this effect was blocked by the α7nAChR
antagonists, α-bungarotoxin and mecamylamine, and by specific siRNA-mediated STAT3
inhibition. Additionally, we demonstrated that nicotine-mediated MUC4 up-regulation promotes
the PC cell migration through the activation of the downstream effectors such as HER2, c-Src and
FAK; this effect was attenuated by shRNA-mediated MUC4 abrogation, further implying that
these nicotine-mediated pathological effects on PC cells are MUC4 dependent. Furthermore, the
in-vivo studies demonstrated a dramatic increase in the mean pancreatic tumor weight [low-dose
(100 mg/m3 TSP), p=0.014; high-dose (247 mg/m3 TSP), p=0.02] and significant tumor metastasis
to various distant organs in the CS-exposed-mice, orthotopically implanted with luciferasetransfected PC cells, as compared to the sham-controls. Moreover, the CS-exposed mice had
elevated levels of serum cotinine [low-dose, 155.88±35.96 ng/ml; high-dose, 216.25±29.95 ng/ml]

and increased MUC4, α7nAChR and pSTAT3 expression in the pancreatic tumor tissues.
Altogether, our findings revealed for the first time that CS up-regulates the MUC4 mucin in PC
via α7nAChR/JAK2/STAT3 downstream signaling cascade, thereby promoting metastasis of
pancreatic cancer.

Introduction

Author Manuscript

Long-term smoking is among the most established risk factors for many cancers, including
chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer (PC) (1, 2). A large prospective study revealed
that current smokers had a 2.5 times greater relative risk of developing PC compared to the
non-smokers (3). Our previous investigations demonstrated that cigarette-smoke (CS)
induces the expression of several genes involved in the exocrine function of the pancreas
(4). With its complexity of constituents, CS causes morphological damage to the pancreas in
multiple ways, which leads to an inflammatory response and alterations in the secretion of
the pancreatic digestive enzymes (5).

Author Manuscript

Nicotine is the major addictive constituent of CS that induces modifications in the functional
properties of cancer cells such as enhancing the rate of proliferation and angiogenesis (6, 7)
at concentrations that are normally found in the blood-stream of smokers (10−8 M to 10−7
M) (6). Importantly, our previous studies showed high levels of nicotine and cotinine, which
is a metabolic derivative of nicotine, in pancreatic tissues of CS-exposed animals (4, 8).
Interestingly, the previous studies by other groups have demonstrated a direct association of
colonic and gastric mucin secretion with nicotine uptake (9, 10).

Several studies have illustrated a strong correlation between the mucin expression and the
development of cancer. Mucins are known to mediate their impact on tumor initiation and
development via modulating cellular growth, differentiation, transformation, adhesion,
invasion and immune surveillance (11–14). Our previous investigations have demonstrated a
differential expression of a membrane bound mucin, MUC4, in pancreatic adenocarcinomas
as compared to the normal pancreas (15). Furthermore, de novo expression of MUC4 was
observed in early precancerous pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasias (PanINs) and its
expression was increased progressively with the development of PC (16). Moreover, using
the MUC4-knockdown and overexpression in the PC cell models, we have shown that
MUC4 potentiates pancreatic tumor cell growth and metastasis by altering the behavioral
properties of the cancer cells (17–19). Recently, our lab investigations have also
demonstrated that MUC4 confers a resistance to anti-cancer agent gemcitabine in PC cells,
hence rendering the current therapeutic regimens ineffective (20, 21).
Usually, PC patients have a mortality rate of nearly 100% and long-term exposure to
cigarette-smoke is one of the several factors that contributes to this high rate (22). Therefore,
a better understanding of the tobacco-smoking-mediated PC pathogenesis would lead to the

identification of potential molecular targets and is likely to improve the prospect of
designing effective therapies to combat this lethal malignancy.
The current study establishes a novel link between the nicotine/CS-exposure and MUC4
overexpression in PC via the α7nAChR/JAK2/STAT3 downstream signaling cascade in
cooperation with the MEK/ERK1/2 pathway. Importantly, the study illustrate that smoking
increases the metastasis of pancreatic cancer through MUC4-mediated activation of the
various downstream effectors such as FAK, HER2 and c-Src. Overall, our findings unfold
new perspectives on the foundation of smoking-induced PC pathogenesis.

Results
Cigarette-smoke and nicotine up-regulates MUC4 expression in PC cells

Western blot analysis showed a progressive increase in the MUC4 expression in the cells
treated with CSE in a dose-dependent manner from 10μl–200μl (Figure 1A). Interestingly, a
progressive increase in MUC4 expression was also observed in a time dependent manner
(4hrs, 8hrs and 24hrs), upon treatment with the major component of CS, nicotine (5μM)
(Figure 1B). The CD18/HPAF cells, treated with different doses of nicotine (1μM, 5μM) for
24hrs time-point, also showed a dramatic increase in the MUC4 expression in a dosedependent manner both at the protein level (~3 fold increase with the highest dose) and at
the mRNA level (~2 fold increase with the highest dose) as compared to the untreated cells
(Figure 1C). The confocal analysis confirmed the up-regulation of MUC4 expression in
CD18/HPAF cells with nicotine treatment (1μM) as compared to the untreated cells (Figure
1C). Similar results were also observed in other PC cells, FG/Colo357 and Capan1
(Supplementary Figure 1A). Quite significantly, nicotine induced the MUC4 expression in
the CD18/HPAF-SF PC cells that expresses MUC4 at undetectable levels under normal
conditions (23), with treatment at concentrations as low as 0.1μM as compared to the
untreated cells and it progressively increased with nicotine treatment in a dose-dependent
manner, hence, demonstrating a more pronounced effect of nicotine on MUC4 expression
(Figure 1D). However, no induction of MUC4 was observed in HPDE cells, the normal
pancreatic epithelial cells that are negative for MUC4 expression under normal
physiological conditions (Supplementary Figure 1B).
Nicotine stimulates the α7 subunit of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor in PC cells

Author Manuscript

With plentiful experimental evidences stating that nicotine exerts its cellular functions
through nAChRs (24), in order to delineate the underlying regulatory mechanism(s) for the
nicotine-induced MUC4 up-regulation, we investigated the expression levels of various
nicotine receptor subunits, α5nAchR (53kDa), α7nAchR (55kDa) and α9nAchR (55kDa), in
our PC cell models. Previous study has shown that α7 is the main nAChR subunit that
mediates the proliferative effects of nicotine in cancer cells (25). Interestingly, the current
study also demonstrated the stimulation of the α7nAChR subunit in the nicotine-treated
CD18/HPAF-SF cells as compared to the untreated cells (Figure 1D); however, no change in
the expression levels of the other receptor subunits was observed. Similarly, stimulation of
α7nAChR subunit was also observed in CD18/HPAF (Figure 1E) and Capan1 cells
(Supplementary Figure 2A), on nicotine treatment. Furthermore, treatment with the

α7nAChR subunit antagonist, α-bungarotoxin (α-BTX), demonstrated a down-regulation in
the nicotine-induced MUC4 expression along with the decreased expression levels of
α7nAChR subunit in CD18/HPAF (Figure 1E) and Capan1 cells (Supplementary Figure
2A). Similar results were also observed when treated with another α7nAChR subunit
antagonist, mecamylamine (MAA) (Supplementary Figure 2A, Supplementary Figure 2B),
with an overall confirmation of the role of α7nAChR subunit in mediating the MUC4 upregulation in PC cells.

cells

Further, detailed studies were performed to elucidate the α7nAChR-mediated downstream
signaling cascade leading to the MUC4 up-regulation. A dose-dependent treatment with
nicotine showed a progressive increase in the phosphorylation of STAT3 (pY705) in the
CD18/HPAF-SF cells (Figure 2A). The 1μM nicotine treatment showed an increased
expression of pJAK2 and an enhanced activation of STAT3 (pY705) in CD18/HPAF cells
(Figure 2B), which was significantly abrogated on treatment with α-BTX in CD18/HPAF
cells, however, no change was observed in the total STAT3 expression (Figure 2B).
Furthermore, the transient knockdown of STAT3 in CD18/HPAF cells via STAT3 specific
siRNA resulted in significant down-regulation of nicotine-induced MUC4 as compared to
scrambled vector-transfected CD18/HPAF cells (Figure 2C). It has been demonstrated that
activation of another phosphorylation site of STAT3 (pS727) through Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK
signaling cascade up-regulates the cytoplasmic concentration of STAT3 and is also known
to increase the DNA-binding (26, 27). Interestingly, in our present studies nicotine treatment
showed an increase in ERK1/2 activation in the CD18/HPAF cells (Figure 2D).
Furthermore, treatment with an ERK inhibitor, UO126, demonstrated a down-regulation in
nicotine-induced MUC4 expression along with reduced levels of both tSTAT3 and nicotineinduced pSTAT3 (pS727) (Figure 2E). Hence, the studies revealed a cooperation of the
Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK and JAK2/STAT3 pathways downstream to α7nAChR as demonstrated
in the previous studies with oral keratinocytes (28).
Nicotine-induced MUC4 increases the migratory potential of the PC cells

Author Manuscript

To assess the pathological impact of nicotine-induced MUC4 on the functional properties of
PC cells, a wound healing assay in parallel with confocal analysis was performed with
nicotine-treated CD18/HPAF cells. The level of wound recovery was higher in nicotinetreated CD18/HPAF cells in comparison to the untreated cells (Figure 3A). Similar results
were also observed in Capan1 cells (Supplementary Figure 3A). Furthermore, the confocal
studies demonstrated an increase in the MUC4 expression (Green; FITC) in CD18/HPAF
cells upon nicotine treatment in a dose-dependent manner (0.1μM, 1μM, 5μM) for 24hrs
(Figure 3A).
Nicotine increases the HER2, c-Src and FAK activation in the PC cells
Our previous studies demonstrated that MUC4 mucin interacts with and stabilizes the HER2
oncoprotein in PC cells (29). Interestingly, in the current study, the 1μM nicotine treatment
showed a significant increase in the total HER2 expression as well as an increase in the
phosphorylation of the HER2(pY1248) (Figure 3B). The immunofluorescence studies

further confirmed the up-regulation of the HER2 expression, and revealed its co-localization
with MUC4 in the nicotine-treated CD18/HPAF cells as compared to untreated cells (Figure
3B). Importantly, the nicotine treatment (1μM) also showed increased levels of a
cytoplasmic protein, c-Src, which is known to have tyrosine-specific protein kinase activity
(Figure 3B). Moreover, the current study illustrated that the nicotine treatment resulted in
increased FAK phosphorylation (pY925) in CD18/HPAF cells (Figure 3B), CD18/HPAF-SF
cells (Figure 3C) and Capan1 cells (Supplementary Figure 3B), however, no change was
observed in the total FAK expression. It is well known that FAK as well as the FAKmediated signaling network plays an important role in cancer metastasis and that it is a
downstream effector protein in HER2 signaling (30).
Nicotine-induced MUC4 as the major cause for increased migratory potential of PC cells

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Previously, our investigations have shown that inhibition of MUC4 expression suppresses
the pancreatic tumor metastasis (17, 19). Hence, to investigate the specific role of nicotinemediated-MUC4 in imparting an enhanced migratory potential to the PC cells, the wound
healing assay was performed using the MUC4 knockdown CD18/HPAF cells (CD18/HPAF/
shMUC4) under nicotine treatment. A comparison was made with the scrambled-vector
transfected CD18/HPAF cells (CD18/HPAF/scr). Further, the confocal analysis was carried
out to assess the correlation between the nicotine-induced MUC4 expression and the change
in the migration potential of the cells. Both confocal analysis and western blot analysis
showed reduced expression of MUC4 in CD18/HPAF/shMUC4 cells as compared to the
CD18/HPAF/scr cells (Figure 4A). Moreover, CD18/HPAF/scr cells showed an increase in
the migration potential with nicotine treatment, however, no variation was observed in case
of CD18/HPAF/shMUC4 cells (Figure 4A). The expression levels of the downstream
effectors of MUC4 such as HER2, pHER2 and pFAK were analyzed in the MUC4
knockdown cells under nicotine treatment. 1μM nicotine treatment up-regulated the MUC4
expression, leading to an increased expression of pFAK in CD18/HPAF/scr cells compared
to the CD18/HPAF/shMUC4 cells (Figure 4B). We also observed comparatively higher fold
of up-regulation in HER2 and pHER2 expression in CD18/HPAF/scr cells as compared to
the CD18/HPAF/shMUC4 cells (Figure 4B). Similar results were also observed in Capan1
cells (Supplementary Figure 3C).
Cigarette-smoke exposure increases the pancreatic tumor weight and potentiates tumor
metastasis

Author Manuscript

Further, the effect of cigarette-smoke exposure on the PC tumorogenesis was evaluated invivo. The whole-body imaging of the immunodeficient mice, orthotopically implanted with
CD18/HPAF-luciferase cells, after six weeks of CS exposure, showed a significant increase
in the tumor metastasis in animal groups exposed to both low and high doses as compared to
the sham controls (Figure 5A). Moreover, the mean tumor size was found to be
progressively increased in the smoke-exposed animals as compared to the sham controls
(low-dose, p=0.014; high-dose, p=0.02) (Figure 5A). Interestingly, a significantly increased
tumor metastasis was observed in both the CS-exposed mice groups. A very significant
increase of tumor metastasis was observed in the liver (n=6/7; p=0.0041) and stomach
(n=5/7; p=0.0082) of mice exposed to high-dose as compared to the sham control (liver,
n=1/7; stomach, n=0/7). The other organs that showed significant metastasis in high-doseOncogene. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2013 September 14.

exposed mice were the spleen (p=0.0317) and mesenteric lymph nodes (p=0.0317). In lowdose-exposed mice, significant metastasis occurred in the liver (p=0.0317), spleen
(p=0.0317) and mesenteric lymph nodes (p=0.0317). Additionally, metastasis to the
peritoneal wall (p=0.0781) and the kidneys (p=0.0781) in the case of high-dose-exposed
mice, and to the stomach (p=0.0781) in the case of low-dose-exposed mice (Figure 5B), was
also observed.
Expression of MUC4, α7nAChR and pSTAT3 in the xenograft pancreatic tumor tissues
after the cigarette-smoke exposure

Author Manuscript

The averaged cotinine levels ± SEM were 155.88±35.96ng/ml and 216.25±29.95ng/ml for
low-dose-exposed and high-dose-exposed animals, respectively. The values were
comparable to the serum cotinine levels in immunocompromised mice as seen in the studies
by Wong et al (31). The xenograft mean pancreatic tumor size was increased both in lowdose-exposed (p=0.014) and high-dose-exposed animals (p=0.02) as compared to the sham
controls (Figure 6A). To evaluate the effect of CS-exposure on the histomorphological
alterations of the pancreas and various other organs with tumor metastasis, such as the
spleen, liver, stomach and kidney, the tissues were fixed, the sections were cut and stained
with Haematoxylin and Eosin (H&E). The H&E staining showed morphological alterations
clearly differentiating the cancer tissues from the normal tissues (Figure 6A). The MUC4
expression showed progressive increase from sham controls to CS-exposed mice groups
(Figure 6B), demonstrating the correlation between the MUC4 expression and CS-exposure.
Moreover, the expression levels of the α7nAChR subunit and pSTAT3 (Y705) were upregulated in the CS-exposed mice as compared to the sham controls (Figure 6B).

Discussion
Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Our earlier studies have shown the specific and differential expression of MUC4 in
pancreatic adenocarcinoma as compared with the normal pancreas or chronic pancreatitis
(15). Here, in the current study, we aim to investigate the effect of nicotine/CS on PC
pathogenesis and to explore the potential link between nicotine/cigarette-smoke-exposure
and MUC4 expression in PC. Interestingly, the CSE demonstrated a progressive increase in
the MUC4 expression in the PC cells. Furthermore, our in-vivo studies also revealed a
progressive increase of MUC4 expression in the pancreatic tissues of the CS-exposed mice
as compared to the sham controls, hence validating our in-vitro observations. Previous
studies have shown that the major component of cigarette-smoke, nicotine, which is not
carcinogenic by itself, has been associated with PC carcinogenesis by increasing the
pancreatic protein synthesis in isolated acini (32). Importantly, in the current study, a
significant MUC4 up-regulation in PC cells upon treatment with nicotine itself showed that
this component of tobacco-smoke is indeed self-sufficient to contribute to PC pathogenesis.
However, the normal pancreatic epithelial cells, that normally do not express MUC4,
showed no induction of MUC4 expression when treated with nicotine (Supplementary
Figure 1B). These observations were in accordance with the literature demonstrating that
smoking contributes more to the promoting than to the initiating phase of cancer (33).

Having seen a strong correlation between the nicotine/CS-exposure and MUC4
overexpression, we next aimed to elucidate the possible regulatory mechanism(s) behind the
nicotine-mediated MUC4 induction and to illustrate the downstream signaling cascade. It is
well known that nicotine imitates the action of a natural neurotransmitter called
acetylcholine and by itself exerts its cellular functions through nAChRs (24). Recent studies
have shown that α7 is the main nAChR subunit that mediates the proliferative effects of
nicotine in cancer cells (25). In the present study, we also observed an up-regulation of the
α7nAChR in the nicotine-treated PC cells. When the cells were treated with the α7nAChR
antagonists, α-BTX and MAA, the expression levels of both MUC4 and the α7 nicotine
receptor subunit decreased significantly, confirming the specificity of the α7nAChR subunit
in nicotine-mediated MUC4 induction in PC cells. While these results seem compelling, the
exact mechanism responsible for the apparent α7nAChR stimulation in context to nicotine
remains unclear. Interestingly, in the present study we observed that the nicotine-induced
MUC4 expression in PC cells was abrogated upon treatment with a calcium channel blocker,
Nifedipine (Supplementary figure 2C). It is known that Ca2+ usually serves as a second
messenger in the nicotine-mediated signaling pathways. In support of this theory, a study
indicated that NNK-mediated activation of α7nAChR raises the Ca2+ influx into lung cells
resulting in membrane depolarization and subsequent activation of voltage-gated Ca2+
channels (34). Moreover, nAChRs, being the ligand-gated cationic channels, are highly
permeable to calcium ions (35). This increased Ca2+ influx through both the nAChRs and
Ca2+ channels eventually lead to nAChR up-regulation, suggesting that there might be a
positive feedback loop associated with the nicotine-induced nAChR signaling (36).

Various studies have demonstrated that nicotine activates multiple transcription factors such
as E2F1 and NFκB (37, 38). Notably, the nicotine-mediated pathological effects in several
malignancies are mediated via pathways governed by STATs, a signal transducer and
activator of transcription, as demonstrated by several reports such as in head and neck
squamous cell carcinoma (28, 39) and bladder cancer (40). Recently, Chen et al.
demonstrated that nicotine strongly activates STAT3, leading to cell cycle perturbations and
chemoresistance in human bladder cancer cells (41). Studies have also shown a cooperation
of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK and JAK2/STAT3 pathways downstream of α7nAChR in oral
keratinocytes leading to alterations in gene expression due to transactivation of STAT3. The
stepwise activation of Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK up-regulates the cytoplasmic concentration of
STAT3 and is also known to induce the phosphorylation of STAT3 (pS727). Some reports
also indicate a correlation of STAT3 serine phosphorylation with increased DNA-binding
(26, 27). The activation of tyrosine kinase JAK2, on the other hand, potentiates the
phosphorylation of STAT3 (pY705) leading to the STAT3-dimerization with subsequent
translocation to the nucleus to alter the expression of various genes (28). Interestingly, in the
present study, the nicotine-induced MUC4 up-regulation was attributed to STAT3 activation
through both the pathways mediated by JAK2 (pSTAT3-Y705) and ERK1/2 (pSTAT3S727). Moreover, in the in-vivo studies, the expression levels of the α7nAChR subunit and
pSTAT3 (pY705) were significantly enhanced in the CS-exposed animals as compared to
the sham controls.

Several studies have shown that STAT3 activation plays a profound role in the aberrant gene
expression, including the mucin overexpression. Andoh et al. showed the STAT3
phosphorylation in HT-29 colonic epithelial cells significantly increasing the mRNA
expression of membrane-bound mucins (MUC1, MUC3, and MUC4) (42). In gastric cancer,
an association between STAT3 activation and MUC4 up-regulation has been shown where
STAT3 binds to a cis-element on the MUC4 promoter (43). In a recent study by the same
group, high expression levels of Muc4 were found in gastric tumors developed in gp130
(Y757F/Y757F) mice, with hyper-activated STAT3 (44). In the present study, we observed
attenuation of MUC4 expression in the PC cells with transient knockdown of STAT3. We
also observed a decreased activation of STAT3 in PC cells after treating them with
α7nAChR-antagonists, further confirming that the STAT3 activation is downstream to
α7nAChR. Collectively, these results strongly supported the relevance of STAT3 in MUC4
regulation and provided clear evidence that the α7nAChR/JAK2/STAT3 signaling cascade,
in association with the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK1/2-mediated pathway, is the possible mechanism
behind the nicotine-induced MUC4 up-regulation in PC. Various other studies have
established the role of another signal transduction regulator, STAT1, in tobacco-related
carcinogenesis (45, 46). Moreover, previous studies in our lab have shown that the induction
of MUC4 by IFNγ occurs via a pathway involving the up-regulation of STAT1 in PC cells
(47, 48). Therefore, exploring the role of the STAT1 signal transduction regulator in CSmediated PC pathogenesis would be an interesting aspect for future studies.

Author Manuscript

With regard to the tumorigenic potential of MUC4 in PC (19), in the current study, we
further analyzed the effect of the nicotine-mediated MUC4 up-regulation on the functional
properties of the PC cells. Our results revealed that the nicotine-mediated up-regulation of
the MUC4 mucin potentiates the migration of the PC cells. The in-vivo studies also
demonstrated the CS-exposure-mediated significant pancreatic tumor metastasis to various
distant organs such as peritoneal wall, mesenteric-lymph-nodes, liver, spleen, kidney and
stomach. Further, to confirm that the nicotine-mediated effects are MUC4-dependent and
not due to the effect of nicotine itself, studies were performed by knockdown of MUC4 in
PC cells followed by the nicotine treatment. It was observed that nicotine fails to increase
the migratory potential of the PC cells in the absence of MUC4, thus, clearly demonstrating
that nicotine-induced MUC4 is the major contributing factor for the augmented migration of
the PC cells.

Author Manuscript

Having seen the stimulatory effect of nicotine/CS on the PC cells’ migration, further, a
detailed elucidation was made to access the pathways downstream of nicotine-inducedMUC4, responsible for the migratory potential of the PC cells. This important phenotypic
change may either directly result from the MUC4-elicited changes in the actin
reorganization due to steric hindrance caused by its large size or indirectly through HER2mediated pathways. The interaction of MUC4 with HER2 in PC cells was shown in our
previous studies and evidence was provided that this interaction stabilizes HER2 (29). It is
well known that FAK, as well as the FAK-mediated signaling network plays an important
role in cancer metastasis (30). Recently, our group showed that MUC4 plays a role in
ovarian cancer cell motility, partly by altering the actin re-arrangements and potentiating
HER2 downstream signaling through FAK activation (49). Interestingly, in the present

study, nicotine robustly increased the total-HER2 expression levels in PC cells and also
leads to its activation by stabilizing pHER2 (pY1248). Additionally, the FAK activation
(pY925) was also observed in PC cells upon nicotine treatment.

Author Manuscript

It is known that elevated Src activity results in the activation of integrin and FAK mediated
signaling, which causes the suppression of cell–cell adhesion (50). Vadlamudi et al have
shown that HER2 signaling selectively activates c-Src and FAK, leading to an increased
cellular motility in breast cancer (51). This suggests that HER2, coupled with activated c-Src
and FAK, plays an important role in aggravating the migratory potential of the cancer cells.
In the current study, nicotine also induces the activation of this cytoplasmic protein, c-Src, in
PC cells, based on which we speculate that this might be an alternate downstream signaling
pathway. Finally, in the MUC4 knockdown studies, we observed that the nicotine induced
high levels of MUC4 in scr-vector-transfected PC cells leading to increased expression
levels of pFAK, HER2 and pHER2. However, in the shMUC4-transfected PC cells, the low
levels of MUC4 resulted in not much of an increase in the HER, pHER2 and pFAK
expression patterns. These findings in the current study clearly reveal that HER2, FAK and
c-Src are the downstream effectors of MUC4 involved in the nicotine-induced increase in
the migration potential of PC cells.

Author Manuscript

In conclusion, our data highlights a novel finding that CS/nicotine up-regulates the MUC4
mucin expression in PC through the α7nAchR-mediated JAK2/STAT3 signaling cascade in
cooperation with Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK1/2 mediated pathway, significantly aggravating the
PC metastasis. The study also unveils that this nicotine-mediated effect is through various
MUC4 downstream effectors, such as FAK, HER2 and c-Src (Figure 7). Overall, our
findings provide a significant mechanistic and functional insight into CS-induced PC
pathogenesis and support the concept that MUC4 is a relevant therapeutic target for this
lethal malignancy. In the future, it will be of interest to validate these observations in PC
patients’ samples having a positive history of cigarette-smoking, to support the pathogenic
relevance of MUC4 with the acquisition of smoking-induced PC pathogenesis.

Materials and Methods
Preparations of cigarette-smoke extract (CSE)

Author Manuscript

CSE was prepared by allowing the flow of cigarette-smoke directly to the medium in a glass
flask with a side-stream smoke exposure system. Two 3R4F filtered reference cigarettes
(Tobacco and Health Research Institute, University of Kentucky) were used to generate
cigarette-smoke. The protocol variables attempt to mimic a standardized human smoking
pattern. Each cigarette was smoked under rigid conditions of 1 puff (35 ml) volume for a 2
sec duration/min over a period of 8 min, delivering approximately 0.8 mg of nicotine/
cigarette.
Cell line model
The cell lines used were CD18/HPAF, Capan1 and FG/Colo357, representing a welldifferentiated stage of PC (17, 19). Additionally, in order to see a more pronounced effect of
nicotine on MUC4 regulation, a serum-free (SF)-adapted derivative of CD18/HPAF cells

(CD18/HPAF-SF) was used, that expresses undetectable endogenous MUC4, while being
cultured in DMEM/F12 media without serum (48). To see the effect of nicotine on the
normal pancreatic epithelia, the human pancreatic ductal epithelial (HPDE) cells were used.
The stable MUC4-knockdown PC cells (CD18/HPAF/shMUC4 and Capan1/shMUC4) as
well as their stable scrambled-vector control cells (CD18/HPAF/scr and Capan1/scr) were
generated by infecting parental cells with retroviral particles produced from plasmid
pSUPER-retro puro.shMUC4 or pSUPER-retro.scr (17). For the in-vivo imaging studies,
CD18/HPAF cells were transduced with retroviral particles produced from plasmid
pMSCV-IRES-Luciferase (Addgene, MA) and positive clones for the presence of luciferase
activity were screened and isolated.
Treatment with CSE, nicotine, α7nAChR subunit antagonists and ERK inhibitor

Author Manuscript

Cells were seeded at a density of 1×106 cells/well in a six-well plate and treated with
different doses of CSE (10μl–200μl). For treatment with nicotine (purchased from Sigma),
cells were seeded in similar fashion and treated in a dose-dependent manner for 24hrs
(1μM–5μM) as well as in a time-dependent manner with 5μM nicotine for (4hrs, 8hrs and
24hrs). The CD18/HPAF-SF cells were seeded at a density of 2×106 cells/well in a six-well
plate and treated in a dose-dependent manner for 24hrs (0.1μM, 1μM). For inhibitor studies,
the cells were treated with α7 subunit of nicotine receptor antagonists, α-bungarotoxin (αBTX) (1μM) and mecamylamine (MAA) (1μM), and ERK inhibitor (UO126) (1μM), 1hr
prior to the nicotine treatment. All of the treatments were carried out with serum-free
DMEM under dark conditions.
Western blotting analysis

Author Manuscript

The cell lysates preparation and Western blotting was done as per the standard procedures
(19). For MUC4, the proteins (20μg) were resolved by electrophoresis on a 2% SDS-agarose
gel under reducing conditions. For rest of the proteins, the 10%-SDS-PAGE was performed
under similar conditions. Primary Antibodies used for the immunodetection were antiMUC4 (8G7, 1:2500), anti-α9nAChR/anti-α5nAChR (gifted by Dr S. Chellappan, FL), antic-Src and anti-p-HER2(Y1248) (Upstate, San Francisco, CA). anti-STAT3, anti-ERK1/2,
anti-FAK, anti-p-FAK(Y925) and anti-HER2 from Santa Crutz Biotechnology. anti-β-actin,
anti-p-STAT3(S727) from Sigma, St Louis, MO, anti-α7nAChR, anti-p-JAK2(Y1007/1008)
from Abcam and anti-p-STAT3(Y705), anti-p-ERK1/2 from Cell Signaling Technology Inc,
MA. Resolved proteins were transferred on to the PVDF membrane and immunoblot assay
was performed.
Reverse transcription-PCR

Author Manuscript

Total RNA was isolated from the cells and 2μg of total RNA was used for the reverse
transcription using the first-strand cDNA synthesis kit (Perkin-Elmer) and oligo-d(T)
primers. PCR was performed for MUC4 gene. The initial PCR activation step was at 94°C
for four minutes, followed by the denaturation step at 94°C for one minute, primer-annealing
step at 58°C for 30 seconds, extension step at 72°C for one minute and the final extension
step at 72°C for ten minutes (19).

Wound healing assay

Author Manuscript

A total of 1×106 Capan1 cells/well and 70,000 CD18/HPAF cells/well were plated and
grown asynchronously to 90% confluency in a six-well plate and a twelve-well plate,
respectively. A scratch was made in three separate places in each well and treated with
nicotine (0.1μM, 1μM and 5μM) for 24hrs. Images were taken at 10X magnification at 0hrs
(t=0hrs) and 24hrs (t=Δhrs) time point. The area of wound was quantified by Java’s Image J
software
Immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy

Author Manuscript

CD18/HPAF/shMUC4 and CD18/HPAF/scr cells (70,000 cells/well) were plated onto the
cover slip in each well of a twelve-well plate for immunostaining and treated with 1μM
nicotine. On the same cover slips, the wound healing assay was performed. The
immunostaining procedure was followed as per our previous methods (17, 49).
STAT3 knockdown using specific siRNA
A pool of three STAT3 specific siRNA oligos (Santa Cruz, CA) was transfected into CD18/
HPAF cells by transient transfection using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen, CA).
After 48hrs of transfection, siSTAT3-transfected CD18/HPAF cells and scrambled siRNAtransfected CD18/HPAF cells were processed for protein extraction and Western blotting.
Cigarette-smoke exposure and whole body in-vivo imaging

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Luciferase containing CD18/HPAF cells (5×105 cells/mice) were orthotopically implanted
in the pancreas of 4–6 week old immunodeficient mice (19). One week after implantation,
animals were exposed to cigarette-smoke, which was generated by smoking a 3R4F filtered
reference cigarette. Mainstream and sidestream smoke was mixed with room air,
conditioned, and drawn into the rodent exposure chamber (TE-10, Teague Enterprises, CA).
The average total suspended particulate (TSP) matter was determined by filtering the air at a
constant flow rate of 5L/min through a 0.3μm filter and determined by the change in its
weight. The animals were randomized into three groups as sham controls (n=7), low-doseexposed (n=7) and high-dose-exposed (n=7). Animals were exposed once every day for six
weeks, to an average of 100 mg/m3 TSP for the low-dose and 247 mg/m3 TSP for the highdose for 70mins. The group of sham-control animals was exposed to filtered air. After six
weeks of exposure, whole body Luciferase bioluminescent images were taken using a
Xenogen IVIS-100, following the intraperitoneal injection of D-luciferin substrate (Caliper
Life sciences) (160μl/mice). Animals were sacrificed, primary tumor was resected and the
presence of metastatic lesions in different organs was determined. Pancreatic tumors were
excised and weighed. For protein extraction, pancreas was snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen
followed by storage at −80°C.
Measurement of Cotinine levels in serum
The cotinine level were measured by competitive ELISA (Calbiotech) in serum obtained by
incubating whole blood for 30min at 37°C, followed by centrifugation. Briefly, 10μl of
standards, controls and serum samples from smoked and control mice were added in
duplicates to anti-cotinine antibody coated plates, followed by the addition of 100μl of

Cotinine-HRP Enzyme Conjugate and 1hr incubation under dark conditions. After six
washings with distilled water, the reaction was developed by adding 100μl of TMB substrate
solution followed by 30min incubation at room temperature under dark conditions. Once the
desired color was developed, the reaction was stopped by adding 50μl of 1M sulfuric acid.
The plates were read at 450nm and data was analyzed using the SOFTMAX PRO software
(Molecular Devices Corp, CA).
Histology and Immunohistochemistry
The resected tumors were fixed in 10% neutral-buffered formalin before processing into
paraffin blocks. Tissue sections (5mm thick) were cut from the blocks and stained with H&E
and with antibodies against α7nAChR (1:50 dilution, Abcam), pSTAT3 (Y705) (1:50
dilution, (Cell Signaling Technology) and MUC4 (8G7, 1:2500 dilution). The
immunohistochemical staining was performed following our standardized procedure (19).

Cigarette-smoke and nicotine-mediated MUC4 up-regulation and overexpression of the α7
nicotine receptor subunit in PC cells. 1A. CD18/HPAF cells were treated with different
doses of cigarette-smoke extract (CSE) (10μl-200μl) for 24hrs; the untreated cells were kept
as mock control. Western blot analysis, using the mouse anti-MUC4 mAb (8G7, generated
in our laboratory), showed a progressive increase in the MUC4 expression with CSE. 1B.
CD18/HPAF cells were treated with 5μM nicotine for different time points (4hrs, 8hrs and
24hrs). Nicotine treatment increased the MUC4 expression in a time-dependent manner with
a maximum expression at 24hrs after the treatment. 1C. Nicotine increased the MUC4
expression levels in CD18/HPAF cells in a dose-dependent manner as seen by the Western
blot analysis and RT PCR analysis, β-actin and GAPDH were used as internal controls.
Confocal immunofluorescence also showed an increased MUC4 expression (FITC: green) in
the nicotine-treated CD18/HPAF cells as compared to the untreated cells. 1D. Nicotine
induced MUC4 expression in CD18/HPAF-SF cells with 0.1μM dose of nicotine which
progressively increased with 1μM dose treatment of nicotine. The Western blot analysis
showed a significant stimulation of the α7nAChR subunit with nicotine treatment (1μM),
whereas, there was no change in the expression levels of the other nAchR subunits such as

α9 and α5. 1E. The 1μM nicotine treatments lead to the stimulation of the α7nAChR
subunit in CD18/HPAF cells. Treatment of the CD18/HPAF cells with the α7 nicotine
receptor subunit antagonist, α-bungarotoxin (α-BTX) (1μM) resulted in down-regulation of
the expression levels of α7nAChR subunit and nicotine-induced MUC4. β-actin was used as
an internal control. Western blots were quantified using the software ChemiImager4400.
The numerical values specified beneath the respective bands of Western blots represent the
fold change in protein expression as compared to that of the control (1.0).

α7nAChR subunit-mediated activation of the JAK2-STAT3 pathway in PC cells. 2A.
Western blot analysis showed that nicotine increases the expression of pSTAT3 (Y705) in
CD18/HPAF-SF cells in a dose-dependent manner (0.1μM, 1μM). 2B. The 1μM nicotine
treatment increased the MUC4, pJAK2 and pSTAT3 (Y705) expression levels which were
abrogated upon α-BTX treatment in CD18/HPAF cells, while the total STAT3 expression
levels remained unchanged. 2C. The siSTAT3-mediated knockdown of STAT3 in CD18/
HPAF cells showed a down-regulation of nicotine-induced MUC4 expression along with the
reduced STAT3 expression levels as compared to the scramble oligo’s-transfected cells 2D.
The 1μM nicotine treatment of CD18/HPAF cells showed an increased ERK activation as
compared to the untreated cells. The total ERK expression levels remained unchanged. 2E.
Treatment of the CD18/HPAF cells with an ERK1/2 inhibitor, U0126 (1μM), resulted in
reduced expression levels of nicotine-induced MUC4 and pSTAT3 (S727), as well as
demonstrated a decrease in tSTAT3 expression. The pJAK2 and pSTAT3 stimulation was
monitored after 24hrs of treatment, however pERK stimulation was monitored after 1hr of
treatment. Western blots were quantified using the software, ChemiImager4400. The
numerical values specified beneath the respective bands of Western blots represent the fold
change in protein expression as compared to that of the control (1.0).

and c-Src and enhanced activation of HER2 and FAK. 3A. CD18/HPAF cells were seeded
on cover slips and were treated with different doses of nicotine for 24 hrs. On the same
cover slips, the wound healing assay was also performed. The confocal analysis showed a
progressive increase in the MUC4 expression (FITC: green) with nicotine treatment. The
wound healing assay showed a progressive increase in the migration potential of the CD18/
HPAF cells in a dose-dependent manner (0.1μM, 1μM, 5μM of nicotine) as compared to the
untreated cells. The migration of cells toward the wounds was expressed as percentage of
wound closure: % of wound closure= [(At=0hrs − At= Δhrs)/ At=0hrs)] * 100%, where, At=0hrs
is the initial area of wound measured immediately after scratching, and At=Δhrs is the area of
wound measured 24 hrs after scratching. Each experiment was performed at least 3 times.
The Student t-test was employed for statistical analysis. Statistical significance was
established at p < 0.05. 3B. Western blot analysis showed an enhanced expression of totalHER2 in the nicotine-treated CD18/HPAF cells as compared to the untreated cells. Confocal
immunofluorescence also showed an increased expression of total-HER2 (Texas red: Red)
and enhanced co-localization with MUC4 (FITC: Green) in the nicotine-treated cells as
compared to the control cells. Western blot analysis showed that nicotine treatment
potentiates the HER2 and FAK activation and increases the levels of c-Src. β-actin was used
as an internal control. 3C. Western blot analysis showed that nicotine treatment increased
the phosphorylation of FAK in the CD18/HPAF-SF cells in a dose-dependent manner
(0.1μM, 1μM of nicotine). The total FAK expression remained unaltered. Western blots

beneath the respective bands of Western blots represent the fold change in protein
expression as compared to that of the control (1.0).

Nicotine-mediated effects are MUC4-dependent. 4A. The wound healing assay was
performed using the shMUC4 and scr-Vector transfected CD18/HPAF cells under nicotine
treatment. In parallel, the confocal analysis was carried out. The scr-vector transfected
CD18/HPAF cells showed an increase in the migration potential upon nicotine treatment,
however, no variation was observed both with the untreated and nicotine-treated shMUC4
transfected cells. The left panel is the lower magnification (10X) image showing the closure
of the wound by the migrating PC cells. The panel on the right is higher magnification (63X)
image of the area on the edge of the wound (square box) demonstrating MUC4 expression
(FITC: Green) in the cells. 4B. The downstream effectors of MUC4 (FAK, HER2)
responsible for the increased metastatic potential of the PC cells were investigated in MUC4
knockdown PC cells. In CD18/HPAF/scr cells, 1μM nicotine treatment induced high levels
of MUC4 leading to an increased expression of HER2, pHER2 and pFAK as compared to
CD18/HPAF/shMUC4 cells. β-actin was used as an internal control. Western blots were
quantified using the software, ChemiImager4400. The numerical values specified beneath
the respective bands of Western blots represent the fold change in protein expression as
compared to that of the control (1.0).

Cigarette-smoke-mediated increase in pancreatic tumor metastasis 5A. Immunodefficient
mice were orthotopically implanted with luciferase-containing CD18/HPAF cells and
routinely exposed to an average of 100mg/m3 TSP for the low-dose and 247mg/m3 TSP for
the high-dose of cigarette-smoke, for six weeks. The Representative in vivo bioluminescent
imaging of the CS-exposed mice showed an increased tumor size as compared to the sham
controls and a significant increase in the metastasis in both the low-dose-exposed animals
and high-dose-exposed animals as compared to the sham controls. All the images are
normalized to the same scale. 5B. Statistical analysis showed significant tumor metastasis to
various potential organ sites, including the peritoneal wall, liver, spleen, mesenteric lymph

Cigarette-smoke-mediated increase in the tumor size and expression levels of MUC4,
α7nAChR subunit and pSTAT3. 6A. The macroscopic examinations of the pancreas and the
distant organs with pancreatic tumor metastasis showing that CS-exposure significantly
increased the tumor metastasis to spleen and liver both in low-dose-exposed and high-doseexposed mice groups as compared to the sham controls. The high-dose-exposed group
showed significant number of metastatic nodules also in the kidney and stomach (arrows
point to the metastatic nodules). Box-and-Whisker plot shows the increase in the mean
pancreatic tumor weight in a dose-dependent manner upon CS-exposure as compared to the
sham controls. P-values lower than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. The H&E
staining of organs showed the histopathological aberrations in the metastatic cancer tissues
(C) as compared to the normal tissues (N). 6B. Immunohistochemistry (8G7; 1:2500) and
Western blotting analysis (8G7; 1:2000) showed that cigarette-smoke progressively
increases the MUC4 expression levels in a dose-dependent manner as compared to the sham
controls. Immunohistochemistry revealed that the expression levels of α7nAChR subunit
and pSTAT3 were enhanced in the CS-exposed mice as compared to the sham controls.

Nicotine-induced α7nAChR/JAK2 pathway in cooperation with nicotine-mediated ERK1/2
activation potentiates STAT3 activation in PC cells. The ERK1/2-mediated STAT3
phosphorylation (pS727) is known to enhance the DNA binding as well as to stabilize the
cytoplasmic STAT3 levels. Whereas, the phosphorylated STAT3 (Y705) forms a dimer and
translocate into the nucleus where it plays the key role in the up-regulation of MUC4 mucin
expression. The transmembrane MUC4 mucin, upon expression on the membrane of the
cells, causes an alteration in the migratory potential of PC cells. MUC4, being a large sized
protein, could be speculated to either directly inhibit the interaction between the integrin and
the extra cellular matrix (ECM) by stearic hindrance, or it could alter the downstream
signaling pathways mediated by HER2 and c-Src activation, resulting in the activation of
integrin and FAK signaling. This leads to the suppression of cell–cell adhesion, thereby
causing an increase in the migratory potential of PC cells. Altogether, these events result in
cancer cell spread and hence contribute to metastasis of pancreatic cancer.
