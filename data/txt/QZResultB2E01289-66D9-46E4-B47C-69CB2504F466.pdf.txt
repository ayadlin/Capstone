ABSTRACT:
DNA repair is critical to resolve extrinsic or intrinsic DNA damage to ensure
regulated gene transcription and DNA replication. These pathways control repair
of double strand breaks, interstrand crosslinks, and nucleotide lesions occurring
on single strands. Distinct DNA repair pathways are highly inter-linked for the fast
and optimal DNA repair. A deregulation of DNA repair pathways may maintain and
promote genetic instability and drug resistance to genotoxic agents in tumor cells by
specific mechanisms that tolerate or rapidly bypass lesions to drive proliferation and
abrogate cell death. Multiple Myeloma (MM) is a plasma cell disorder characterized by
genetic instability and poor outcome for some patients, in which the compendium of
DNA repair pathways has as yet not been assessed for a disease-specific prognostic
relevance. We design a DNA repair risk score based on the expression of genes coding
for proteins involved in DNA repair in MM cells. From a consensus list of 84 DNA
repair genes, 17 had a bad prognostic value and 5 a good prognostic value for both
event-free and overall survival of previously-untreated MM patients. The prognostic
information provided by these 22 prognostic genes was summed within a global
DNA repair score (DRScore) to take into account the tight linkage of repair pathways.
DR
score was strongly predictive for both patients’ event free and overall survivals. Also,
DR
score has the potential to identify MM patients whose tumor cells are dependent on
specific DNA repair pathways to design treatments that induce synthetic lethality by
exploiting addiction to deregulated DNA repair pathways.

INTRODUCTION

to more than ten years[2-4]. MM can be classified
into hyperdiploid MM characterized by chromosome
duplication (48-75 chromosomes) in MMCs or nonhyperdiploid MM. Primary translocations involving the
immunoglobulin heavy chain locus and recurrent target
genes are identified in about 70% of non-hyperdiploid
MM and 15% of hyperdiploid MM[5, 6]. Additional
molecular defects target various genes, which deregulate
the p53 pathway (monoallelic deletion of the TP53

Multiple myeloma (MM) is a plasma cell disease
arising from the malignant transformation of postfollicular B cells and affects 22000 new individuals in
the EU or US each year[1]. This disease is characterized
by extensive molecular heterogeneity in multiple
myeloma cells (MMCs) and diversity in overall
survival of patients, which ranges from several months

gene and TP53 mutations), NK-B pathway (mutations
or amplifications), RAS pathway (mutations), or MYC
pathway (amplification, rare translocations)[7, 8]. These
abnormalities may concur to deregulate cell cycle
checkpoints and impact on the array of DNA repair
pathways[9].
In healthy cells, pleiotropic DNA damage occurs
each day due to spontaneous base alterations, exposure
to endogenous metabolites or exogenous agents, and
errors during DNA replication[10, 11]. Multiple DNA
repair proteins function together in order to detect and
repair the different types of DNA lesions to avoid cell
death from excess DNA damages. There are 6 major
DNA repair pathways active in mammalian cells. Base
excision repair (BER), nucleotide excision repair (NER)
and mismatch repair (MMR) operate on nucleotide
lesions occurring on single strands. The BER pathway
repairs damaged bases [10] and the MMR pathway targets
insertion/deletion loops and mismatches errors during
replication[12]. The NER pathway removes bulky lesions,
in particular resulting from UV induced DNA damages
such as pyrimidine adducts[13]. Two main pathways,
homologous recombination (HR) and non-homologous
end joining (NHEJ) are involved in DNA double strand
breaks (DSBs), which are highly cytotoxic[11]. Finally,
proteins involved in the Fanconi Anemia disease (Fanconi
anemia [FA] pathway) cooperate with NER and HR
pathways to repair interstrand crosslinks (ICLs), which
are covalent links between two opposite strands of DNA
induced by exposure to chemicals such as bifunctional
alkylating agents[14, 15]. The mechanisms of DNA repair
have been extensively reviewed recently[11, 16]. They
involve briefly DNA lesion recognition, DNA exonuclease
, DNA polymerase and DNA ligase activities. DNA repair
pathways are highly inter-connected due to the fact that
a DNA repair protein can be involved in two or more
pathways and that a repair engages several pathways,
requiring tight regulatory control in normal cells[11, 16].
A deregulation of these DNA repair pathways could
readily promote genetic instability and drug resistance in
MMCs by bypassing or accelerating non-accurate DNA
repairs to prevent cell death as reviewed recently[9].
Since the MM clone evolves at the genome level as
disease progresses, it is highly likely that deregulated
DNA repair pathways are implicated in clonal evolution[9,
17, 18]. These pathways are also of particularly relevance
for genotoxic drugs used to treat patients with MM,
presently doxorubicin, melphalan, cyclophosphamide, and
bendamustine[9]. This is again the case for Bortezomib,
a proteasome inhibitor and not directly genotoxic, which
targets homologous recombination by depleting the pool
of free ubiquitin [19]. Consequently, DNA repair pathways
in MM are highly relevant to understanding response to
the current spectrum of therapeutics agents in clinical use.
In the current study, we investigate the prognostic
value of gene expression based scores built to
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

systematically assess genes encompassing the major DNA
repair pathways. The data reveals specific patterns of
gene expression in MMCs that have prognostic value for
both event free and overall survival of newly-diagnosed
patients.

RESULT
Linking expression levels of DNA repair genes
and patient overall survival
A consensus list set of 84 genes coding for the
main 6 DNA repair pathways was obtained by review
of medline and the current literature of DNA repair
pathways (Supplementary Table S2)[11, 16, 20]. The 6
DNA repair pathways were non-homologous end-joining
(NHEJ), homologous recombination (HR), Fanconi
anemia pathway (FA), nucleotide excision repair (NER),
mismatch repair (MMR) and base excision repair (BER).
Using the R MaxStat function and Benjamini Hochberg
multiple testing correction, 17 out of the 84 genes had
bad prognostic value and 5 a good prognostic value for
both event-free and overall survivals using the patients of
HM cohort (Table 1). These 22 prognostic genes include
5 genes coding for NHEJ pathway (3 bad: WHSC1, RIF1
and XRCC5(KU80); 2 good: PNKP and POLL), 6 genes
for HR (5 bad: EXO1, BLM, RPA3, RAD51 and MRE11A;
1 good: ATM), 3 bad genes for FA (RMI1, FANCI and
FANCA), 8 genes for NER (6 bad: PCNA, RPA3, LIG3,
POLD3, ERCC4 and POLD1; 2 good: ERCC1 and
ERCC5), 2 bad genes for MMR (EXO1 and MSH2) and 1
bad gene for BER (LIG3) pathways.

Building a global DNA repair pathway score
(DRscore) for predicting patients’ survival
As DNA repair pathways are tightly linked, the
prognostic information provided by the 22 prognostic
DNA repair genes was summed within a global DNA
repair pathway (DRscore) as indicated in the Materials and
Methods. The variation of DRscore in malignant plasma
cell populations is shown in Figure 1. The Maxstat statistic
test cuts the HM-patient cohort within 2 groups: 24.8% of
patients with a DRscore > -7.62 with a median OAS of 27.9
months and 75.2% of patients with a DRscore ≤ -7.62 with
a median OAS not-reached (P = 6.2E-15, Figure 2A). The
DR
score could also predict for EFS (Figure 3A). The highrisk DRscore group had a median EFS of 15.7 months and
the low-risk DRscore one a median EFS of 41.1 months (P
= 3.3E‑8, Figure 3A). DRscore was also prognostic for the
UAMS-TT2 cohort of 345 patients. Using the cutoff of
-7.62 defined on the HM cohort, 27.8% of UAMS-TT2
cohort patients were identified as high-risk DRscore (P =
.001, Figure 2B). The median OAS was not reached in

Using univariate Cox analysis on HM cohort, all these
factors had prognostic value and the DRscore had the

analysis, DRscore, RS score, t(4;14), ISS, 2m and albumin

significant when tested together with IFM score, RS
score, t(4;14), del17p, ISS, 2m and albumin (Table 2C).
However, it failed to be significant when tested together
with UAMS-HRS, likely due to overfitting since UAMSHRS was built using UAMS-TT2 cohort.

HRS had the higher hazard ratio followed by t(4;14) and
DR
score. Using multivariate Cox analysis, DRscore remained
an independent prognostic factor for EFS when tested
together with UAMS-HRS, IFM score, RS score, t(4;14),

to be significant.

Prognostic value for event free survival of DRscore
was compared with the other prognostic factors mentioned
above. Using univariate Cox analysis on HM cohort, all
these factors were significantly associated with patients’

DNA repair pathways. Despite a reduced number of
prognostic genes coding for a specific pathway (Table
1), we looked whether scores built using the same
methodology as the global DNA repair score and specific
for a pathway could have prognostic value. Using
maxstat analysis for overall survival, NHEJ, HR, FANC
or NER scores were significantly associated with highrisk myeloma in the 2 independent patients’ cohorts,
HM and UAMS-TT2 (Figure 4). MMR score had only
prognostic value for the HM cohort and BER score was
not considered since it comprises one prognostic gene
only.

deregulated cell cycle and/or DNA repair by inactivating
some pathways, in particular the p53 pathway, making
their survival dependent on remaining pathways. Targeting
these remaining pathways will make cells unable to repair
DNA damages, complete cell cycle or gene transcription,
and bring them to death[16, 34-37]. The current prognostic
scores integrating genes coding for NHEJ, HR, FA NER,
or MMR pathways could be of interest to identify patients
with MM who could benefit from inhibitors targeting key
component in these pathways. In particular inhibitors
to DNA-PKs (NHEJ), RAD51 (HR), PARP1/2 (HR,
altNHEJ, BER), CHK2 (HR, altNHEJ), CHK1 (HR,
NER) are currently under clinical investigation in various
cancers[16, 34]. A clinical trial investigating the efficacy
of PARP1/2 inhibitors in patients with MM resistant
to proteasome inhibitors is under development[38].
Indeed, proteasome inhibitors block Fanconi anemia and
homologous recombination pathways, rendering MM cells
addict on BER initiated by PARP1/2-mediated Poly(ADPribosyl)ation of proteins[38]. It is of major interest to
look for whether the DRscore in MMCs prior treatment
could predict for the response of patients to DNA repair
inhibitors. In this case, this DRscore will be of use in
stratifying MM patients and exploiting the addiction of
tumor cells to a specific DNA repair pathway.

METHODS
DISCUSSION

Patient samples and gene expression data

By selecting genes coding for proteins involved in
repair of DNA damages, we have built a DNA repair score
assembling genes encoding for the various DNA repair
pathways. This is particularly relevant since these various
pathways are tightly linked and inter-dependent to repair
DNA [10, 11]. The DRscore is predictive for both event
free and overall survival as evaluated in two independent
cohorts of patients with MM. It remained an independent
prognostic factor when tested together with known
molecular prognostic factors such as previously-published
GEP-based risk scores, t(4;14), del17p and with standard
clinical prognostic factors, ISS, 2m and albumin in two
independent large patients’ cohorts. The UAMS-TT2
cohort is particularly relevant in comparing the prognostic
value of these factors, excluding UAMS-HRS, as DRscore
was not designed on this cohort, which avoids overfitting.
Of note, prognostic scores assembling genes coding for
a specific DNA repair pathway can be also built, despite
the reduced number of prognostic genes for each pathway.
DNA repair pathways are deregulated in many
MM patients and could provide adaptive mechanisms to
trigger drug resistance[9]. Novel compounds targeting
DNA repair pathways are being clinically evaluated in
patients with cancer inducing synthetic lethality[16]. The
principle of synthetic lethality is that tumor cells have

Multiple Myeloma cells (MMCs) were purified from
the 206 patients with newly-diagnosed MM after written
informed consent was given at the University hospitals
of Heidelberg (Germany) or Montpellier (France) as
described[24]. Clinical characteristics of the HM cohort
are provided in Supplementary Table S1. The study was
approved by the ethics boards of the University Hospitals
of Heidelberg and Montpellier. Gene expression profiling
(GEP) of purified MMCs was assayed using Affymetrix
U133 2.0 plus microarrays as described[25] and data
normalized using the MAS5 Affymetrix algorithm with
a scaling factor of 500. The .CEL and MAS5 files are
deposited in the ArrayExpress public database (http://
www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/) under accession number
E-MTAB-362. We also used publicly available MAS5
normalized GEP data (GEO, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.
gov/geo/, accession number GSE2658) from purified
MMCs of a cohort of 345 patients treated with total
therapy 2 protocol (UAMS-TT2 cohort) at the University
of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS, Little Rock,
USA) [26]. As iFISH data were not available for UAMSTT2 patients, t(4;14) translocation was evaluated using
MMSET spike expression [27] and del17p13 surrogated
by the level of TP53 [28].

A consensus list set of 84 genes coding for the
main 6 DNA repair pathways has been obtained by
review of Medline and the current knowledge of DNA
repair pathways [11, 16, 20](Supplementary Table
S2). The prognostic value of each of the 84 genes was
computed using maximally selected rank test from R
package MaxStat (http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/
maxstat/index.html) on HM patient cohort and Benjamini
Hochberg multiple testing correction, yielding to 22
genes whose expression values was significantly (P ≤ .05)
associated with both event-free (EFS) and overall survival
(OS). A DNA repair pathway score (termed DRscore) was
built to group the prognostic information of these 22 genes
within one parameter using a methodology which was
proven as powerful in building various gene expression
based risk scores[4, 31-33]. For each of the 22 DNA
repair genes, the odd ratio of the Cox analysis on the HM
cohort were determined with R MaxStat package, and for
each patient, these odd ratios were weighted by +1 if the
patient’s gene expression is above the Maxstat cutoff, and
-1 if below or equal this cutoff. The DRscore of a given
patient was the sum of these weighted odd ratios for the 22
prognostic genes. DRscore ranges from -22.45 to +21.59
and the higher the DRscore is, the worse the prognosis is.
Patients from the same cohort were ranked according to
increased DRscore and for a given value S, the difference
in overall survival of patients with a DRscore ≤ S or > S
was computed, making it possible to define the DRscore
value with a maximum difference in survival using
maximally selected rank test from R package MaxStat.
