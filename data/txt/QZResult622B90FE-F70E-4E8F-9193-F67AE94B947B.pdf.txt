ABSTRACT:
Most NSCLC patients with EGFR mutations benefit from treatment with EGFRTKIs, but the clinical efficacy of EGFR-TKIs is limited by the appearance of drug
resistance. Multiple kinase inhibitors of EGFR family proteins such as afatinib have
been newly developed to overcome such drug resistance. We established afatinibresistant cell lines after chronic exposure of activating EGFR mutation-positive PC9
cells to afatinib. Afatinib-resistant cells showed following specific characteristics as
compared to PC9: [1] Expression of EGFR family proteins and their phosphorylated
molecules was markedly downregulated by selection of afatinib resistance; [2]
Expression of FGFR1 and its ligand FGF2 was alternatively upregulated; [3] Treatment
with anti-FGF2 neutralizing antibody blocked enhanced phosphorylation of FGFR in
resistant clone; [4] Both resistant clones showed collateral sensitivity to PD173074,
a small-molecule FGFR-TKIs, and treatment with either PD173074 or FGFR siRNA
exacerbated suppression of both afatinib-resistant Akt and Erk phosphorylation when
combined with afatinib; [5] Expression of twist was markedly augmented in resistant
sublines, and twist knockdown specifically suppressed FGFR expression and cell
survival. Together, enhanced expression of FGFR1 and FGF2 thus plays as an escape
mechanism for cell survival of afatinib-resistant cancer cells, that may compensate
the loss of EGFR-driven signaling pathway.

INTRODUCTION

treatment in NSCLC patients with EGFR mutations have
demonstrated remarkable response rates of approximately
80% (2-8).Whereas most NSCLC patients with EGFR
mutations benefit from treatment with EGFR-TKIs.
However, almost all the individuals eventually develop
resistance to these drugs.
Acquired resistance to EGFR-targeted drugs is
one of the major obstacles to further improve clinical
outcomes in this field. Further intensive research efforts

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death
worldwide (1). Somatic mutations in the epidermal
growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene have been identified
as a major determinant of the clinical efficacy of treatment
with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) such as
gefitinib and erlotinib in patients with non-small cell lung
cancer (NSCLC). Prospective clinical trials of EGFR-TKI

have been focused on clarifying the mechanisms by
which cancer cells acquire resistance to EGFR-targeted
drugs (9, 10). T790M mutation, Met amplification, loss
of PTEN, IGF-IR overexpression, and the AXL and Slug
are reported to be the underlying mechanisms responsible
for the EGFR-TKI resistance phenotype (11-16). The
T790M mutation of EGFR has often been associated with
acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs in EGFR mutationpositive NSCLC. However, this mutation is present even
in 31.5% of NSCLC patients pretreated with EGFRTKIs, indicating that T790M is associated with de novo
resistance (17, 18). Activation of alternative pathways,
such as Met amplification or IGF-IR overexpression, has
also been implicated in resistance to EGFR-TKIs in cells
harboring activated EGFR mutation (12, 14). Furthermore,
loss of PTEN and increased overexpression of MAPK,
ABCG2, IGF1R, AXL, and BCL-2 have been reported as
mechanisms of acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs (9, 10).
We have also reported that loss of PTEN expression and
loss of activating EGFR gene allele results in acquisition
of resistance to EGFR-TKIs in lung cancer cells
harboring activated EGFR mutations (13, 19). However,
the underlying mechanisms of resistance to EGFR-TKIs
in patients with EGFR mutations have not been fully
elucidated. The appearance of drug resistance in tumors
during treatment of NSCLC patients with EGFR-TKIs has
been a persistent obstacle.
In order to overcome drug resistance in relapsed
NSCLC, multiple kinase-targeted drugs such as afatinib
and ARQ197 have been further developed, and these are
now being investigated in clinical trials (20, 21). Afatinib
is an irreversible HER2/ErbB-family blocker that shows
high affinity for EGFR T790M mutation. In phase III
trials comparing afatinib with cisplatin and pemetrexed as
first-line therapy, NSCLC patients with EGFR mutation
had a higher response rate than patients without EGFR
mutations when they received afatinib (22). In the present
study, we invstigated how afatinib resistance was acquired
in lung cancer cells, and also which oncogenic signaling
pathway could be activated as a compensatory mechanism
for cell survival. Here we report bypass activation of
FGFR, and discuss the use of afatinib in combination with
FGFR inhibitors for reversal strategy.

We also established a revertant cell line, PC9 BR (21Mo),
by culturing PC9 BR (11Mo) under drug free condition
for 10 months. Dose response curves for PC9 and drugresistant PC9 BR, PC9BR (3Mo), (10Mo), (11Mo) and
(21Mo) cells to various doses of afatinib were determined
by WST assay (Figure 1A). PC9BR (3Mo) cells that
were selected after continuous exposure to the drug for 3
months already showed higher resistance, similar to that
of PC9BR (10Mo) and PC9BR(11Mo). The IC50 values
for each cell line were determined from the dose response
curves for gefitinib and afatinib (Supplementary Table
1). PC9BR (3Mo), PC9BR (10Mo) and PC9BR (11Mo)
cells were 3370-12900 times and 1170-135400 times
more resistant to afatinib and gefinitib, respectively, than
PC9 cells. By contrast, PC9BR (21Mo) cells showed
similar sensitivity to both drugs as their parental PC9 cells
(Supplementary Table 1), indicating that PC9 BR (21Mo)
cells lost its drug resistant characteristic.
We then performed Western blotting analysis for
biochemical profiling of these cells in the absence or
presence of afatinib (Figure 1B). Drug-resistant PC9BR
(10Mo) and PC9BR (11Mo) cells showed markedly
decreased expression of pEGFR, HER2/pHER2, and
HER3/pHER3 compared with PC9 and PC9BR (21Mo).
By contrast, we observed increased expression of FGFR1
and pFGFR in the PC9BR (10Mo) and PC9BR (11Mo)
cells relative to PC9 and PC9BR (21Mo) cells. Selection
for afatinib resistance did not affect expression of EGFR
expression. Phosphorylation of EGFR was susceptible
to affatinib at 100 nM and 1000 nM in all of PC9 BR
(10Mo), PC9BR (11Mo), PC9 and PC9BR (21Mo) cell
lines. Afatinib markedly suppressed phosphorylation of
Akt and Erk in PC9 and PC9BR (21M0) cells but not
in PC9BR (10Mo) and PC9BR (11Mo) cells without
affecting Akt and Erk expression (Figure 1B).
All of these cell lines did not harbor T790M
mutation in the EGFR gene.

Enhanced expression of FGFR1 by selection of
afatinib resistance
To further characterize afatinib-resistant cells, we
cloned three sublclones, PC9/B3 (B3), PC9/B19 (B19)
and PC9/B20 (B20), from PC9BR (11Mo) cells, and
Rev1 from PC9BR (21Mo) cells. Dose response curves
for afatinib were obtained for PC9 and their three drugresistant subclones in the presence of various doses of
afatinib (Figure 1C). From the dose response curves,
IC50 values were determined, and all resistant clones
showed 750- to 880-fold higher resistance to afatinib than
PC9(Table1). We also determined the dose response curves
of PC9, B19 and B20 to various drugs (Supplementary
Figure S1), and the IC50 values of these three cell lines for
each drug were calculated(Table 1). Both afatinib-resistant
sublclones showed more than 900-fold higher resistance
to gefitinib, about 50-fold higher resistance to lapatinib,

RESULTS
Establishment of afatinib-resistant lung cancer
cells
The PC9 cells were grown initially in medium
containing 0.01 µM afatinib, and the concentration of
afatinib was gradually increased up to 1 µM over the
following 11 months to establish the afatinib-resistant cell
lines PC9 BR(3Mo), PC9BR(10Mo), and PC9BR(11Mo).

and 2-fold higher resistance to foretinib, respectively, than
their parental PC9 cells. By contrast, B19 and B20 showed
2- to 5-fold higher collateral sensitivity to PD173074
(Figure 1D), an inhibitor of FGFR 1 and 3 tyrosine
kinase (Table 1). The sensitivities of B19 and B20 cells to
axitinib, dasatinib, cisplatin and paclitaxel were found to
be similar to those of PC9 (Table 1).
Therefore, we next compared expression levels of
various growth factor receptors and their downstream
regulatory molecules between PC9 and its resistant
subclones (Figure 1D). Both resistant clones showed
markedly decreased expression of pEGFR, and activated
mutant EGFR (746del), HER2/pHER2, and HER3/pHER3
in comparison with PC9 cells. By contrast, there was no
apparent change in the expression levels of IGF1R/pIGF1R between the resistant subclones and PC9. We
observed increased expression of FGFR1 and pFGFR in
the resistant subclones relative to their parental counterpart
(Figure 1E). Expression levels of unphosphorylated and
phosphorylated Akt and Erk in PC9 and its drug-resistant
subclones were similar.
Microarray analysis revealed that expression
of FGFR2, FGFR3, and FGFR4 was only slightly or
negligibly expressed in the resistant clones (unpublished
data), suggesting that other FGFR family proteins except
FGFR1 are unlikely to be involved in acquisition of drug
resistance in B19 and B20 cells.

was highly susceptible to afatinib as in PC9. Expression
of FGFR1 was found to be markedly downregulated, as
in PC9, and phosphorylation of Akt and Erk was also
similarly susceptible to afatinib in Rev1. The restored
sensitivity to afatinib in Rev1 was accompanied by both
activation of EGFR and decreased activation of FGFR1.
We next compared the effect of exogenous addition
of FGF2 on FGFR phosphorylation in PC9 and its drugresistant subclones. Expression level of pFGFR were
already higher in both resistant clones than in PC9 in the
absence of FGF2. The time kinetics for treatment with
FGF2 showed time-dependent enhancement of FGFR
phosphorylation in both B19 and B20, accompanied
by enhanced activation of Akt and Erk (Figure 2C). By
contrast, no apparent phosphorylation of FGFR was
observed in the parental PC9 cells. Figure 2D shows dosedependent increased activation of FGFR and Akt and
Erk in B19 and B20 when treated with various doses of
FGF2. However, FGFR phosphorylation in PC9 was not
augumented by FGF2. FGFR in both resistant sublclones
thus seemed to be constitutively phosphorylated, and
further phosphorylated in the presence of exogenous
FGF2 (Figure 2C and 2D). We then investigated whether
autocrine stimulation of B19 by secreted endogenous
growth factor was responsible for activation of FGFR
phosphorylation and was thus responsible for weaken of
pFGFR and its downstream signaling (Figure 2E).

Constitutive activation of FGFR through
increased expression of both FGF2 and FGFR1
by acquisition of afatinib resistance

FGFR activation is closely correlated with
acquired resistance to afatinib
We finally investigated whether FGFR was closely
correlated with afatinib resistance in B19 and B20. Both
resistant subclones were collaterally sensitive to an
inhibitor of FGFR-TKI, PD173074 (Table1), and their
FGFR was constitutively activated through an autocrine
loop by FGF2. We first examined whether FGFR-TKI was
able to block constitutive activation of Akt and Erk, which
was not susceptible to the inhibitory effect of afatinib. The
phosphorylation of FGFR was almost completely blocked
by PD173074 alone and afatinib augmented this inhibitory
effect in resistant subclones (Figure 3A). Apoptosis was
also induced in two resistant clones by treatment with
PD173074 alone or with both PD17074 and afatinib when
assayed by PARP band cleavage.
We next examined whether the cell growth of
drug-resistant clones was inhibited by FGFR-TKI. Cell
growth of PC9 was blocked by afatinib alone, but not by
PD173074 (Figure 3B). By contrast, there was marked
growth inhibition of both resistant sublclones upon
treatment with PD173074 alone or with both PD173074
and afatinib. We further examined whether FGFR1
knockdown by its cognate siRNA also exacerbated the
inhibitory effect of afatinib on apoptosis and Akt/Erk
phosphorylation in drug-resistant sublclones (Figure 3C).

Since FGFR1 was constitutively phosphorylated in
drug resistant clones, we examined whether FGFR was
phosphorylated through an autocrine loop by its own
FGF2 in resistant subclones. Using ELISA assay, we next
compared the protein expression levels of FGF2 in serumfree conditioned medium among PC9, B19, B20, and Rev1
clones (Figure 2A). Both resistant sublclones produced
more than 30-fold higher levels of FGF2 of about 50 pg/
ml than PC9 and Rev1.
As shown in Figure 2B, we next compared the effect
of afatinib on phosphorylation of EGFR family proteins,
and their downstream signaling molecules and also the
expression levels of FGFR1 among PC9, Rev1, and drugresistant sublclones. Phosphorylation of EGFR, HER2
and HER3 was almost completely blocked in PC9, B19,
B20, and Rev1 upon treatment with afatinib at 100 and
1000 nM (Figure 2B). By contrast, phosphorylation of Akt
and Erk in both resistant subclones was not at all affected
by afatinib. Expression of FGFR1 was also markedly
upregulated in resistant sublclones relative to PC9, but
its phosphorylation was not blocked by afatinib (Figure
2B). Furthermore, Rev1 showed similar expression levels
of pEGFR to that of PC9, and EGFR phosphorylation

accompanied by inhibition of Erk phosphorylation but not

enhanced (Figure 4A). Figure 4A also showed increasing
expression of Twist and Snail that are closely involved
in transcription of EMT-related genes in resistant cells.
Figure 4B also shows that expression of Twist, Snail, Slug,
and ZEB1 was increased in resistant cells, accompanied by
a decrease in the expression of E-cadherin and an increase
in that of vimentin. We also observed morphological
changes of fibroblast-line cell by selection of afatinibresistant cells, accompanying by decreasing expression of
E-cadherin with increasing expression of vimentin (data
not shown).
We examined whether Snail and other related
transcription factors were responsible for the enhanced
expression of FGFR1 in drug resistant cell lines.
Expression of ZEB1, Snail and Slug proteins was
relatively much higher in B19 than PC9 (Figure 4C),
and expression of Twist mRNA was also much higher in
B19 and B20 than PC9 (Figure 4D). We confirmed that

expression of Twist mRNA was downregulated by its
cognate siRNA. Treatment with siRNAs for ZEB1, Twist,
Snail and Slug resulted in markedly decreased expression
of ZEB1, Snail and Slug proteins, and also Twist mRNA
(Figure 4C and 4D).
As seen in Figure 4C, treatment with Twist siRNA,
but not with ZEB1, Snail and Slug siRNAs, specifically
suppressed expression of FGFR1 in resistant clones.
Expression of FGFR1 was almost completely blocked,
accompanying by decreased phosphorylation of Akt and
ERK when B19 or B20 cells were treated with Twist
siRNA for 24hr and 48hr (Figure 4E). We also observed
cell growth inhibition of B19 and B20 when treated with
Twist siRNA alone or with afatinib (Figure 4F). We next
examined whether Twist overexpression might promote
FGFR1 expression. FGFR1 mRNA levels in PC9 were
found to be increased about 3 fold over the control when
twist was overexpressed by transfection of Twist cDNA
(Figure4G).Expression of FGFR1 thus seems to be
specifically promoted by Twist than other transcription
factors in afatinib-resistant clones.

was resistant to the inhibitory effect of afatinib ; [4] of
EMT-related transcriptional factors, Twist knockdown
specifically reduced expression of FGFR1; and [5] afatinib
together with either FGFR-TKI or FGFR1 knockdown
markedly suppressed Akt and Erk phosphorylation, and
cell growth and survival. Together, impaired expression
of EGFR family proteins thus seems to compensatorily
activate FGFR1-driven signaling pathway by acquired
drug resistance to afatinib.
Acquisition of afatinib resistance resulted in
markedly decreased expression of EGFR family proteins
including activated EGFR, HER2 and HER3, which are
targets for afatinib. This decreased expression of these
EGFR family proteins might be mostly involved in
acquisition of afatinib resistance. Our relevant study has
recently demonstrated that loss of the activated mutant
EGFR gene copy is closely associated with resistance to
erlotinib and gefitinib, suggesting that expression levels
of activated mutant EGFR can limit cellular sensitivity
to such EGFR-TKIs (19). Furthermore, afatinib-resistant
sublclones are also cross-resistant to gefitinib and also
lapatinib (Table 1). EGFR forms a duplex with HER2
or HER3 (31), and sensitivity to lapatinib is controlled
through HER2 and/or EGFR (32, 33). The crossresistance to lapatinib in afatinib-resistant sublclones
might be due to marked downregulation of HER2/pHER2
and pEGFR/activated mutant EGFR. With regard to
the pleiotropic mechanisms involved in acquisition of
resistance to EGFR-TKIs and other kinase inhibitors, the
alternative pathway is one mechanism of escape from
the cytotoxic or therapeutic effects of EGFR-targeted
drugs (10). Activation of alternative pathways, such as
Met amplification and IGF1R overexpression, has been
implicated in resistance to EGFR-TKIs in non-small cell
lung cancer cells bearing EGFR mutation (12, 14), and

DISCUSSION
Our present study revealed novel characteristics of
afatinib-resistant sublclones established from the drugsensitive lung cancer cell line PC9 harboring the activated
deletion E746-A750 mutant EGFR. In these afatinibresistant sublclones,[1] expression of most of the EGFR
protein family, including pEGFR, mutant EGFR, HER2
and HER3, and Met, was markedly downregulated;[2] they
showed collateral sensitivity to PD173074 (FGFR-TKI ) ;
[3] there was alternatively enhanced expression of FGFR1
and its ligand FGF2, and phosphorylation of Akt and Erk

Figure5:Our hypothetic model shows how afatinib resistance is acquired in lung cancer cells. In drug sensitive cell line, the

cell survival and growth of human lung cancer cells harboring activating EGFR depends upon the EGFR/EGFR family driven PI3K/Akt
and Erk pathways, and this cell survival and growth is highly susceptible to afatinib and other EGFR-TKIs. By contrast, afatinib-resistant
subclones express elevated levels of FGFR1 together with FGF2, resulting in activation of Akt and Erk, when EGFR/EGFR family-driven
cell growth/survival signaling pathways are mostly attenuated. Of EMT-related transcription factors, Twist seems to specifically responsible
for elevated expression of FGFR1 in afatinib resistant cell lines.

these molecules bypass the original oncogenic pathway
to confer resistance to previously effective therapy. In
afatinib-resistant sublclones, however, there was no altered
expression of IGF1R (Figure 1D). and no phosphorylation
of Met (date not shown), suggesting that the alternative
pathway involving IGF1R and Met is unlikely to be
involved in afatinib resistance.
The FGFR tyrosine kinase family is consisted
of 4 receptors and 23 ligands and activation of FGFRs
is common oncogenic event (34). Recent study by
Herrera-Abrea et al has demonstrated that EGFR limits
drug sensitivity to FGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor in
FGFR3-mutant cell lines, and also that combination of
FGFR and EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors overcome
drug resistance to FGFR inhibitors, suggesting the close
interaction of EGFR-and FGFR-driving cell growth
or signaling pathways (35). In our present study using
lung cancer cell lines, FGFR1 is most abundant receptor
of the four family proteins in afatinib-resistant clones
of PC9, and there was no enhancement in expression
of other FGFR family proteins FGFR2, FGFR3 and
FGFR4 (see Figure 4A). Ligand binding leads to FGFR1
dimerization, autophosphorylation, and activation of
signaling components including Akt and Erk kinases,
further affecting malignant transformation of cancer
cells. We observed that the growth factor receptor-driven
downstream molecules, Akt and Erk, were still highly
phosphorylated in the presence of afatinib in resistant
sublclones when expression of most of the EGFR family
proteins was downregulated (Figure 1B, Figure 1E and
Figure 2D). A possible mechanism underlying such
activation of Akt and Erk in drug-resistant subclones
treated with high doses of afatinib is that they induce
increased expression of FGFR1 and pFGFR together
with increased expression of FGF2 (see Figure5). Mark
et al. have demonstrated various levels of expression of
the FGF family proteins, FGFR1 and FGFR2, in NSCLC
cell lines, and also shown that FGF2/FGFR1 autocrine
signaling affects their sensitivities to gefitinib and FGFRTKI (36). Both resistant sublclones, B19 and B20, showed
more than 20-fold higher expression with 50 ng/ml FGF2
than their drug-sensitive counterpart cell lines, PC9 and
Rev1 (Figure 2A). Both B19 and B20 already showed
FGFR phosphorylation in the absence of exogenous FGF,
suggesting an autocrine activation loop for FGF2-FGFR1
by afatinib resistance (Figure 2B and 2C). Exogenous
addition of FGF further augmented FGFR phosphorylation
and activation of both Akt and Erk in both resistant
sublclones, but not at all in their parental counterpart PC9
cells (Figure 2B and 2C), suggesting the absence of FGF2FGFR1 autocrine activation loop in PC9, possibly due to
loss of active FGFR1 and FGF2 expression in the parental
drug sensitive counterpart.
Concerning the possible link between FGF/FGFR
and drug resistance to EGFR-TKIs, we have previously
demonstrated amplification of the FGFR2 gene in
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

lapatinib-resistant breast cancer cells (37). Furthermore,
Ware et al. (30) have reported that gefitinib-resistant cells
after chronic exposure of several NSCLC cell lines to
gefitinib showed increased expression of both mRNA and
protein for FGFR1 and FGF2. A relevant study by Terai
et al. has demonstrated that gefitinib-resistant sublclones
from PC9 had enhanced expression of FGFR1 and FGF2,
and also that gefitinib sensitivity in drug-resistant cells
was restored by a combination of FGFR-TKI and gefitinib
(38). Treatment with FGFR-TKI or FGFR knockdown
also induced marked reduction of Akt and Erk activation
in afatinib-resistant sublclones (Figure 3A and C). Coadminstration of afatinib and FGFR-TKI also reduced
apoptosis and suppression of cell growth in drug-resistant
cells (Figure 3A , 3B, and 3C). These results strongly
suggest that acquisition of afatinib resistance is due to
oncogenic switch from activated EGFR family proteins
to the FGF/FGFR signaling pathway (Figure5). FGFR1
may thus function as a survival factor for afatinib-resistant
cancer cells, and activation of the FGFR-driven bypass
signaling pathway confer resistance to previously effective
therapy.
FGFR1 expression is often upregulated when
epithelial cells are transformed into mesenchymal cells
(39, 40).Microarray analysis demonstrated enhanced
expression of EMT-related transcription factors such as
Snail and Twist in afatinib-resistant clone (Figure 4A).
Furthermore, we screened whether knockdown of these
four EMT-related transcription factors could suppress
phosphorylation of Akt and Erk in resistant clones in the
presence of afatinib, and Twist knockdown specifically
blocked Akt phosphorylation (unpublished data). Our
present studies, clearly showed that increased expression
of FGFR1 in afatinib-resistant clones was almost
completely blocked only when treated with Twist siRNA
(Figure 4B and 4D). Drug resistance to afatinib was also
overcome by Twist knockdown in both resistant clone,
B19 and B20, accompanying by suppression of both
Akt and Erk activation (Figure 4D and E). Furthermore,
transfection of Twist cDNA resulted in restored expression
of FGFR1 in drug-resistant clone. It thus seems likely
that Twist plays a pivotal role in enhanced expression
of FGFR1 in resistant clones. Further study should be
also required whether Twist alone plays a major role in
overexpression of FGF2.
In conclusion, we have clarified one of the
mechanism by which how PC9 cells acquired resistance
to afatinib in vitro. Selection by afatinib resistance
induced marked loss of the EGFR family proteins, EGFR,
HER2 and HER3, together with inactivated EGFR family
proteins, and simultaneously induced marked increases
in the expression of FGF2 and activation of FGFR1.
Such activation of the FGF/FGFR autocrine loop may
have a compensatory role in promoting the survival and
growth of afatinib-resistant cells. Whether this mechanism
operates in patients with tumors refractory to EGFR-TKIs

and multikinase inhibitors remains to be further studied.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Cells were plated in 96-well flat-bottomed plates and
cultured for 24 h before exposure to various concentrations
of drugs for 72 h. Cell counting kit 8 (WST-8 Doujindo,
Kumamoto, Japan) was then added to each well, and the
cells were incubated for 3 h at 37°C before measurement
of absorbance at 450 nm with a Multilabel counter ARVO
MX (PerkinElmer, USA). Absorbance values were
expressed as a percentage of that for untreated cells, and
the concentration of tested drugs resulting in 50% growth
inhibition (IC50) was calculated using the Prism program
(GraphPad, San Diego, CA). Triplicate wells were tested
at each drug concentration.

Cell culture and reagents
The human lung cancer cell line PC9 harboring del
E746-A750 activating mutation in EGFR was maintained
in RPMI1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum
(FBS) and incubated in a humidified atmosphere of 5%
CO2 at 37°C. The PC9 cells were kindly provided by
Dr. Mayumi Ono (Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan)
(13, 19, 23). Cells were routinely confirmed to be free
of mycoplasma contamination using mycosensor QPCR
Assay kits (Agilent Technologies).Afatinib, lapatinib,
foretinib, gefitinib, and dasatinib were purchased from
Selleck (Houston, USA). PD173074, cisplatin, paclitaxel
and axitinib were from Sigma Aldrich (St. Louis, MO).
The construction of pcDNA3-Twist has previously been
described (24). The small interfering RNAs (siRNA)
corresponding to FGFR1, Twist1, ZEB1, Snail, and Slug,
mRNA and a non-specific siRNA (control) were purchased
from Nippon Gene (Tokyo, Japan). Cells were transfected
with siRNA duplexes using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX
and Opti-MEM (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) according to
the manufacturer’s recommendations.

Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction
and EGFR mutation analysis
Quantitative real-time PCR and EGFR mutation
analysis was done as previously described (13, 25). All
experiments were performed in a triplicate assays. To
analyze the T790M mutation, exon 20 of the EGFR gene
was amplified using the PCR primer set and TaKaRa Ex
Taq polymerase (TaKaRa BIO, Inc). PCR products were
directly used as templates for cycle sequencing reactions
using the BigDye Terminator v1.1 Cycle Sequencing kit
(Applied Biosystems). The forward or reverse primers
were used for cycle sequencing reactions, which were
carried out in an ABI PRISM 310 Genetic Analyzer.

Western blot analysis

Gene expression microarrays

Western blot analysis was done as previously
described (36) with antibodies for phosphorylated
FGFR (pFGFR), FGFR1, p EGFR(Y1086), EGFR,
pHER2(Y1221/1222), HER2, pHER3, HER3, pAkt, Akt,
Erk, cleaved PARP, PARP, Vimentin, E-cadherin, Snail,
Slug, ZEB1 (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA),
Twist (Sigma,St. Louis, MO), and pERK (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, CA) or β-actin (Sigma,St. Louis, MO).

The cRNA was amplified, labeled, and hybridized
to a 44K Agilent 60-mer oligomicroarray according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. All hybridized microarray
slides were scanned by an Agilent scanner. Relative
hybridization intensities and background hybridization
values were calculated using the Agilent Feature
Extraction Software program (9.5.1.1).

Isolation of afatinib-resistant PC9 cells

Data analysis and filter criteria

To isolate afatinib-resistant cell lines, we cultured
in increasing, step-wise doses of afatinib up to 1 µM
over the following 11 months, and PC9 BR(3Mo),
PC9BR(10Mo), and PC9BR(11Mo) were established
(13, 19). We also established the revertant cells, PC9BR
(21Mo), by culturing PC9BR (11Mo) cells under drugfree condition for 10 months and generated the subclones
Rev1 from PC9BR (21Mo). Using limiting dilution, we
further generated the clones B3, B19 and B20 from PC9
BR (11Mo). The identity of these clones was confirmed by
analyzing their short tandem repeat profile using the Cell
ID System (Promega, Madison, WI).

Raw signal intensities and flags for each probe were
calculated from the hybridization intensities, and spot
information, according to the procedures recommended
by Agilent. And the raw signal intensities of two samples
were log2-transformed and normalized by a quantile
algorithm (27) on the Bioconductor (28, 29). We selected
probes that called the ‘P’ flag in both control and
experimental samples. To identify up or down-regulated
genes, we calculated Z-scores (29) and ratios (non-log
scaled fold-change) from the normalized signal intensities
of each probe. We thereafter established the criteria for the
regulated genes: (up-regulated genes) Z-score ≥ 2.0 and
5916

ratio ≥ 1.5-fold, (down-regulated genes) Z-score ≤ -2.0
and ratio ≤ 0.66.

Determination of FGF 2by ELISA
The concentrations of FGF2 in the conditioned
medium were measured using commercially available
ELISA kits (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). Cells
were plated in 24-well dishes in medium containing 10%
FBS. When the cells reached subconfluence, the medium
was replaced with RPMI1640 medium without FBS, and
then the cells were incubated for a further 24 hours. The
concentrations of FGF2 in the supernatants were measured
using an ELISA kit in accordance with the manufacturer’s
protocols.
