Our study reported that miR-31 is a regulator of multiple mRNAs important for different
aspects of breast cancer metastasis. We recently identified concerns with several figure
panels in which original data were compiled from different replicate experiments in order to
assemble the presented figure. The scope of the figure preparation issues includes compiling
data from independent experiments to present them as one internally controlled experiment,
statistical analyses based on technical replicates that are not reflective of the biological
replicates, and comparisons of selectively chosen data points from multiple experiments. As
many of the published figures are therefore not appropriate or accurate representations of the
original data, we believe that the responsible course of action is to retract the paper. We
apologize for any inconvenience we have caused.
