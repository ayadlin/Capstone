BACKGROUND: Alterations in the retinoblastoma pathway in germ cell tumors (GCTs) have been described. In the phase 1 trials of
the selective cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 inhibitor palbociclib, 3 patients with unresectable, growing, mature teratoma syndrome
achieved prolonged disease stabilization. The authors conducted an open-label, phase 2 study to determine the efficacy and safety
of palbociclib in patients with incurable, refractory, retinoblastoma protein (pRB)-expressing GCTs. METHODS: Patients who had incurable, refractory GCTs that demonstrated pRB expression by immunohistochemistry received oral palbociclib 125 mg daily for 21
days followed by a 7-day break. The primary endpoint was the 24-week progression-free survival (PFS) rate. A 24-week PFS rate
15% was considered promising, and a PFS rate 5% was not considered promising. RESULTS: Thirty patients received treatment,
and 29 were evaluable for the primary endpoint. The estimated 24-week PFS rate was 28% (90% exact confidence interval, 15%-44%).
Patients who had teratoma and teratoma with malignant transformation had significantly better PFS than patients who had nonteratomatous GCTs. Toxicity was manageable and was principally hematologic. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with palbociclib was associated with a favorable 24-week PFS rate in patients with refractory, pRB-expressing GCTs. Benefit was mainly observed in patients

INTRODUCTION
Metastatic germ cell tumors (GCTs) are highly curable, largely because of highly effective cisplatin-based chemotherapy.
Patients who are not cured with first-line chemotherapy may subsequently be cured by salvage chemotherapy, including
high-dose therapy.1 Despite these successes, little progress has been made in the treatment of refractory GCTs.2 Unresectable, growing teratoma syndrome3 and teratoma with malignant transformation (TMT)4,5 represent especially challenging problems, because there is no effective drug therapy for these tumors.
Phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein (pRB) by cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) 4 and 6 (in association
with cyclin D) results in a cell’s passage through the G1-S interface.6 Abnormalities in this G1-S checkpoint play an important role in the pathogenesis of many malignancies and may be related to the overexpression or amplification of cyclin
D and/or the dysregulation of CDKs.7 In tumors with functional pRB in which cellular proliferation is driven by cyclin
D, the inhibition of CDK4/6 is an attractive potential therapeutic approach.
Palbociclib or PD0332991 (Pfizer Inc., New York, NY) is a potent oral inhibitor of CDK4/6 that prevents the phosphorylation of pRB, resulting in cell cycle arrest at the G1/S interface.8 Palbociclib has demonstrated antiproliferative
effects and selective G1 arrest in pRB-expressing tumor cell lines. Palbociclib also inhibited the growth of several types of
pRB-expressing tumor xenografts, but not pRB-negative tumor xenografts.9 In phase 1 clinical trials, palbociclib was generally well tolerated, with reversible neutropenia the most common dose-limiting toxicity.10,11 Encouraging activity of

palbociclib has been reported in mantle cell lymphoma,
which is known to overexpress cyclin D1,12 and in liposarcoma, which is associated with CDK4 amplification.13
Aberrations of the retinoblastoma pathway are also
important in GCTs. The up-regulation of CDK4 and
cyclin D2 is a central event in GCT tumorigenesis.14 In
addition, CCND1, the gene that encodes cyclin D1, is
over-expressed in cisplatin-resistant GCT.15 Although
undifferentiated GCTs have decreased or absent pRB
expression, more differentiated nonseminomatous GCTs,
such as teratomas, demonstrate strong pRB expression.16,17 We previously reported that 3 patients with
unresectable, growing, mature teratoma syndrome who
received palbociclib in phase 1 trials achieved prolonged
disease stabilization.18 Therefore, we performed a singlearm phase 2 trial of palbociclib in patients with pRBexpressing, refractory, metastatic GCT.

Patients were classified as having teratoma if the predominant histology was mature or immature teratoma with no
malignant elements; teratoma with malignant transformation if the predominant histology was teratoma with malignant somatic elements; and GCT if the predominant
histology was embryonal carcinoma, yolk sac tumor, choriocarcinoma, seminoma, or mixed elements, but not teratoma. Expression of pRB was determined by
immunohistochemistry on archived, paraffin-embedded
tumor specimens using standard methods (RB1 mouse
monoclonal antibody; Thermo Lab Vision; Thermo
Fisher Scientific, Waltham, Mass). Nuclear pRB staining
intensity was classified as 0, 11, 21, or 31. Patients with
nuclear pRB staining 11 were eligible. The percentage
of tumor cells that were positive for nuclear pRb was
recorded. A normalized nuclear pRB score was calculated
as the staining intensity multiplied by the percentage of
positive tumor cells.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Design

Treatment

This was a single-institution, nonrandomized, open-label
phase 2 study. The primary endpoint was progression-free
survival (PFS) at 24 weeks. A PFS rate 15% at 24 weeks
was considered promising, and a PFS rate <5% at 24
weeks was considered not promising. A 2-stage design was
used.19 In the first stage, 15 patients were to be enrolled.
If 1 patient achieved PFS at 24 weeks, then up to 15 additional patients were to be enrolled. Palbociclib would be
considered promising if 4 patients demonstrated PFS at
24 weeks. This design has a type I error rate of 10% and a
power of 80%.

Patients received oral palbociclib 125 mg daily for 21 days
followed by a 7-day break. This was the maximum tolerated dose for the 3/1 schedule determined in the phase 1
trial.10 Cycles were repeated every 28 days if, on day 1 of
the cycle, the absolute neutrophil count was 1000/lL
and the platelet count was 50,000/lL. The daily dose
was reduced to 100 mg and 75 mg for grade 3 and 4 hematologic toxicity, respectively. Doses could be increased
in subsequent cycles if reduced dose cycles were tolerated
without grade 3 or 4 hematologic toxicity.
Assessments

Eligible patients had incurable, refractory, metastatic
GCT, including teratoma and TMT. Patients had initially signed consent to have their archived tumor specimens screened for pRB expression, and those who had
tumors that screened positive for pRB expression were eligible for the treatment protocol. Other inclusion criteria
were age 18 years, adequate organ and bone marrow
function, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1, and measureable disease according to Response Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)
(version 1.0). The protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of Pennsylvania,
and all patients provided written informed consent.

Clinical examinations and laboratory tests were performed at screening, at the start of treatment, and at the
start of each cycle. A complete blood count was performed
weekly during cycle 1. Computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging was performed every 2 cycles.
Tumor response and progression were assessed by the
treating physician and subsequently confirmed by a radiologist in the RECIST core facility of the Abramson Cancer Center who was blinded to patient identification and
outcome. Assessments were reduced to every 3 cycles for
patients who had received treatment for 18 months.
Toxicities were assessed and graded according to the
National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (version 3.0).

proportion of patients who had >24 weeks of PFS since
the start of the treatment. Exact 90% confidence intervals
(CIs) based on binomial distribution were computed. To
analyze the time-to-event endpoint of PFS, the KaplanMeier method and log-rank tests were used. P values < .10 were considered statistically significant.
RESULTS
Between April 2010 and January 2014, 30 patients met
eligibility criteria, signed informed consent, and received
treatment with palbociclib. The characteristics of these
patients are listed in Table 1. All patients were initially
diagnosed with metastatic nonseminomatous GCT and
received standard first-line, cisplatin-based chemotherapy.
The primary tumor site was testis in 20 patients (67%),
ovary in 4 patients (13%), and extragonadal in 6 patients
(20%). Most patients had undergone postchemotherapy
surgery for residual disease. In fact, the median number of
prior surgeries related to metastatic GCT was 3, and 1
patient had undergone 9 prior GCT surgeries. All patients

had surgically incurable disease assessed at the time of
enrollment. In addition, 60% percent of patients had
received at least 1 additional prior salvage chemotherapy
regimen. One patient had mature teratoma localized to
the brain and spinal cord. One patient with mature teratoma had previously received palbociclib in the phase 1
trial.10,18 This patient was considered nonevaluable for efficacy but was included in the current toxicity analysis.
Twelve patients (40%) had teratoma; 10 patients (33%)
had TMT, including 5 with adenocarcinoma and 4 with
primitive neuroectodermal tumors; and 8 patients (27%)
had GCT, including 2 patients with late relapse.20
Efficacy

Twenty-nine patients were evaluable for efficacy. Eight
of the 29 evaluable patients achieved 24-week PFS. The
estimated 24-week PFS rate was 28% (90% exact CI,
15%-44%). This exceeded the proposed, promising 24week PFS rate of 15%. Of the 11 evaluable patients with
teratoma, 5 achieved 24-week PFS. Four patients with
teratoma remained progression free at 60 weeks, and 3
were progression free at 80 weeks. One of the patients
with teratoma who achieved 24-week PFS had disease
localized to the brain and spinal cord. Two of the 10
patients with TMT achieved 24-week PFS; both had adenocarcinoma. Of the 8 patients with nonteratomatous
GCT, only 1 experienced 24-week PFS. This patient had
late relapse of a yolk sac tumor. At data cutoff, 4 patients
were continuing on therapy, and all others had progressed. The median follow-up was 11 weeks (range, 198 weeks).

The median PFS for all evaluable patients who
received treatment was 11 weeks. The PFS rate was statistically significantly different between the 3 pathology
groups (log-rank test; P 5 .0107) (Fig. 1), with a median
PFS of 23 weeks, 18 weeks, and 5 weeks for patients with
teratoma, TMT, and GCT, respectively. The normalized
nuclear pRb score was not associated with PFS when
examined as a continuous variable or when using predetermined cutoff points. No patient demonstrated an
objective response according to RECIST. Fifteen of 29
evaluable patients (52%; 90% exact CI, 35%-68%)
achieved stable disease as their best response.
Toxicity

The incidence of grade 2 through 4 adverse events possibly, probably, or definitely related to study treatment is
provided in Table 2. Toxicity was principally hematologic. Grade 3 and 4 toxicities included neutropenia
(43%), anemia (7%), and thrombocytopenia (17%). One
patient experienced uncomplicated neutropenic fever. No
grade 3 or 4 nonhematologic adverse events were
reported. Twelve patients (40%) required at least 1 dose
reduction for hematologic toxicity. There were no
treatment-related deaths.
DISCUSSION
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported
clinical trial of a cell cycle inhibitor in patients with refractory GCT. However, the population treated was not typical for a refractory GCT population, in that the majority
of patients had teratoma or TMT as the predominant histology. This is likely because patients with relapsed GCT
have other options, such as salvage third-line or fourthline chemotherapy or other clinical trials, whereas most
1466

patients with unresectable teratoma have limited options.
There may also have been a referral bias, because we previously reported benefit of palbociclib in 3 patients with
growing teratoma syndrome.18 This study represents the
largest reported trial of patients with incurable teratoma
and TMT who received treatment with a specific drug
therapy.
Given the requirement for pRb expression, which is
most commonly observed in more differentiated GCTs
like teratomas,16,17 and our prior experience treating
growing teratoma syndrome with palbociclib,18 we anticipated that most enrolled patients would have teratoma or
TMT. The primary endpoint of PFS at 24 weeks was chosen based on our clinical experience with the growth rate
of refractory teratoma and TMT. This is also supported
by the scant literature that is available. Speiss et al reported
on a series of patients with growing teratoma syndrome
who ultimately underwent postchemotherapy retroperitoneal lymph node dissection. In their study, the median
growth rate during chemotherapy was 0.7 cm per month
(95% CI, 0.1-2.4 cm per month), and the median tumor
size was 3 cm (range, 2.5-25 cm).21 We hypothesized
that, if the patients with teratoma enrolled in our trial had
similar growth rates, then it would be unlikely that these
patients would not demonstrate disease progression if
they were untreated for 24 weeks. In a separate report of 4
patients with TMT who received chemotherapy without
undergoing subsequent surgery, the response durations
were only 2 months, 5 months, 8 months, and 12
months.5 Given the lack of options for these patients, we
hypothesized that achieving a 24-week PFS rate of 15%
would be clinically meaningful. In addition, given the
cytostatic nature of palbociclib, we were concerned that a
primary endpoint of an objective response according to
Cancer

RECIST might exclude a potentially beneficial drug for
this patient population.
The 24-week PFS rate of 28% (90% exact CI, 15%44%) exceeded the proposed, promising 24-week PFS
rate of 15%. Prolonged disease stabilization was mainly
observed in patients with teratoma and, to a lesser degree,
those with TMT. The median PFS in the GCT group was
5 weeks, similar to what was reported previously and suggesting that palbociclib as a single agent is not effective in
these patients.2 Although patients experienced prolonged
disease stabilization, none demonstrated an objective
response according to RECIST. This is not surprising for
an agent that induces cell cycle arrest, and our results are
similar to those from a recently reported trial of palbociclib in liposarcoma, in which only 1 of 29 evaluable
patients demonstrated a partial response despite an
encouraging 12-week PFS rate.13
A potential, important limitation of our trial is the
heterogeneous nature of the treated patients with respect
to tumor biology. For example, the expected baseline
growth rate of mature teratoma is likely different from
that of GCT. Although patients were enrolled in the trial
because of progressive disease, the lack of clear documentation of pretreatment growth is a limitation, because outcomes could be influenced by the underlying biology of
the tumor. Future trials should account for this potential
bias to allow more definite conclusions concerning the
effect of the drug on the growth of these tumors. Conversely, the choice of 24-week PFS as the primary endpoint may have limited this bias, because it is unlikely that
any of these patients would not have demonstrated disease
progression if they had remained untreated for 24 weeks.
Treatment with palbociclib was well tolerated. Myelosuppression was the principal toxicity, as reported in
other trials with this agent. The lack of significant nonhematologic toxicity was striking. Given that some patients
were heavily pretreated, 40% of patients required dose
reductions for hematologic toxicity. Little cumulative toxicity was noted, and patients were able to remain on treatment for multiple cycles.
We believe that the CDK4/6 inhibitor therapy
deserves further study in patients with pRB-expressing, refractory GCTs. Based on the results presented here, we
suggest that future trials of CDK4/6 inhibitors focus specifically on patients with unresectable teratomas and
TMTs. The identification of an effective agent for these
generally young patients represents an unmet medical
need. Therefore, additional clinical trials in these patients
are warranted. A randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 2
trial of the CDK4/6 inhibitor LEE011 (Novartis AG,
Cancer

May 1, 2015

Basel, Switzerland) is planned in patients with unresectable, incurable teratoma (but not TMT). That trial will
require radiographic evidence of disease progression for
eligibility, which should limit the potential bias related to
tumor heterogeneity inherent in this disease.
