ABSTRACT
Dual PI3K/mTOR(phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/mammalian target of
rapamycin) inhibitors are being evaluated clinically for the treatment of tumors with
a hyperactivated PI3K/mTOR pathway. However, unexpected outcomes were obtained
in clinical studies of cancer patients with an aberrant PI3K pathway. In clinical
trials, applicable combination regimens are not yet available. In this study, using an
integrated analysis of acquired BEZ235-resistant nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells,
we demonstrate that DNA methyltransferase is a key modulator and a common node
upstream of the AKT/mTOR and PDK1/MYC pathways, which are activated in cancer
cells with acquired BEZ235 resistance. DNA methyltransferases were upregulated
and induced PTEN and PPP2R2B gene hypermethylation, which downregulated
their expression in BEZ235-resistant cancer cells. Reduced PTEN and PPP2R2B
expression correlated with activated AKT/mTOR and PDK1/MYC pathways and
conferred considerable BEZ235 resistance in nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Targeting
methyltransferases in combination with BEZ235 sensitized BEZ235-resistant cells
to BEZ235 in vitro and in vivo, suggesting the potential clinical application of this
strategy to overcome BEZ235 resistance.

prostate cancer [6], medulloblastoma [7], non-small cell

liposarcoma [12], cholangiocarcinoma [13], leukemia [14],
pancreatic cancer [15, 16] and nasopharyngeal carcinoma
[17] in preclinical studies, especially in PIK3CA mutant
subtypes. PIK3CA gene mutation and amplification are
observed frequently in NPC, especially in advanced
stages of disease [18], indicating a potential therapeutic
effect of the dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor in nasopharyngeal
carcinoma. BEZ235 significantly inhibits cell proliferation
in nasopharyngeal carcinoma both in vitro and in vivo by
blocking the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway [17, 19].
However, the outcomes of BEZ235 for phase I
and phase II trials are unsatisfactory. Exploring the

INTRODUCTION
Targeted therapies might represent the future of
personalized medicine for cancer patients. However, the
phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-AKT pathway is one
of the most commonly deregulated signaling pathways
in human cancers [1]. Genetic aberrations that affect
this pathway, such as mutations that activate PIK3CA
or inactivate PTEN, have been identified in virtually all
epithelial tumors [2]. It has been reported that BEZ235,
one of the dual PI3K/mTOR(phosphatidylinositol
3-kinase/mammalian target of rapamycin) inhibitors, has a
potent inhibitory effect in numerous tumors such as breast
cancer [3], hepatic carcinoma [4], ovarian carcinoma [5],

mechanism(s) underlying these unexpected outcomes,
researchers have found that primary and acquired
resistance could be involved. The former might occur in
cancers without hyperactivation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR
pathway or activation of alternative pathways. The latter
might result from the mutation of targets or activation
of alternative pathways that lead to ineffective clinical
therapies. Although multiple mechanisms of BEZ235
resistance have been identified in preclinical studies, the
underlying mechanisms are varied in different tumors.
In addition, the acquired resistance to BEZ235 remains
elusive. Elucidation of the mechanism underlying
acquired resistance will contribute to the design of
anticancer treatment strategies. For example, blockade
of the PI3K pathway activates AR signaling in prostate
cancer and results in elevated pHER3 in breast cancer,
and combination therapies have been shown to effectively
improve cancer regression [20, 21].
In this study, we report a rationally designed
therapy to conquer BEZ235 resistance that may benefit
patients with aberrant PI3K/mTOR pathway-associated
nasopharyngeal carcinoma. We found that the two
survival signaling pathways, AKT/mTOR and PDK1/
MYC, were activated in cells with acquired BEZ235
resistance. Next, we identified DNA methyltransferases as
a common node that is overexpressed in resistant models.
We also showed direct activation of the AKT/mTOR
and PDK1/MYC pathways by PTEN and PPP2R2B
methylation, which is induced by overexpression of DNA
methyltransferases. Notably, targeting this key node with
a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor universally sensitized
resistant cells to BEZ235 treatment in vitro and in vivo.
Our data indicate that combination treatment with a
methyltransferase inhibitor together with BEZ235 could
be a useful strategy to overcome BEZ235 resistance.

resistant cells were able to form stable populations and
could be passaged in the presence of BEZ235 (Figure
1E). Despite resistance to apoptosis, the BEZ235-selected
cells proliferated significantly slower than their parental
counterparts (Figure 1F). In addition, cell cycle analysis
by flow cytometry showed that the resistant cells were
arrested at the S/G2 transition, indicating the mechanism
underlying the slow growth (Figure 1G). A basement
membrane model was used to evaluate the adhesion
activity of the cells. Our results indicated that cell adhesion
was significantly promoted in resistant cells (Figure 1H).
As noted, the most common mechanism of
resistance to kinase inhibitors involves sustained activation
of the downstream and bypass signaling pathways. In
explorations of the mechanism of signaling pathway
activation, overexpression of receptor tyrosine kinases
(RTKs) is the best understood mechanism [22]. However,
compared to parental cells, overexpression of RTKs (data
not shown) has not been observed in resistant sublines.
To further explore the mechanism of resistance, whole
gene methylation analysis using an Illumina Methylation
BeasChip was performed in the sensitive parental cells
and the resistant cells. The 37395 CpG probes were
found to be differentially methylated; two-thirds were
hypermethylated in resistant cells (Figure 1I). Promoter
methylation and negative expression of tumor suppressor
genes have been shown to be involved in tumorigenesis.
Compared to parental cells, BEZ235-resistant cells
displayed promoter hypermethylation of the tumor
suppressor genes PTEN and PPP2R2B(Supplementary
Table S2), suggesting that methylation of these genes may
function to promote cancer proliferation.

PTEN hypermethylation activates the PI3K/
mTOR signaling pathway to induce BEZ235
resistance

RESULTS

PTEN is a negative regulator of the PI3K/AKT/
mTOR pathway, and PTEN promoter methylation is an
alternative mechanism of PTEN deletion [23]. PTEN
promoter methylation correlates with decreased PTEN
protein expression, which often increases AKT/mTOR
pathway activation in tumor progression [24]. To verify
the gene hypermethylation reported using the Methylation
Chip, a pyrosequencing technique was conducted to analyze
the methylation status of PTEN promoters. The PTEN
promoters analyzed by pyrosequencing were selected based
on the Methylation Chip findings. Compared to parental
cells, PTEN promoter methylation clearly increased
(Figure 2A). We next investigated whether PTEN promoter
methylation correlated with PTEN protein expression.
PTEN expression was reduced in two resistant cell lines,
suggesting an inverse association between PTEN promoter
methylation and PTEN protein expression (Figure 2B). The
loss of PTEN expression in parental cells suggested that
it might contribute to BEZ235 resistance. To investigate

DNA hypermethylation in acquired dual PI3K/
mTOR inhibitor-resistant cells
We modeled the development of acquired resistance
in patients by treating PIK3CA mutant nasopharyngeal
carcinoma cells (CNE2, HONE1) with increasing doses
of BEZ235 for 6 to 9 months to select BEZ235-resistant
sublines (CNE2/235, HONE1/235) (Supplementary
Table S1). The resistant sublines were cultured in
0.4 μmol/L BEZ235. The concentration was chosen
because it induced 50% apoptotic cells in the parental
lines (Figure 1A). Compared with the parental lines, the
resistant cells were significantly more resistant (9.0–13.2
fold) to BEZ235 treatment in vitro (Figures 1B and
1D). Interestingly, the BEZ235 sublines with acquired
resistance were also resistant to GDC0980 (4.2–10.5
fold), another dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor that differs
structurally from BEZ235 (Figures 1C and 1D). The

this possibility, we created a PTEN deficiency cells in the
parental sublines by PTEN knockdown with siRNA. PTEN
knockdown increased the phosphorylation of AKT, P70 and
GSK3β, which are known key proteins in the PI3K/AKT/
mTOR pathway (Figure 2C). PTEN knockdown universally
induced resistance of nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells to
BEZ235 treatment (Figure 2D). These data indicate that
PTEN deficiency induced by hypermethylation activates the
PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, which is involved in BEZ235
resistance.

with decreased PPP2R2B expression (Figure 3A and
3B). To dissect the possible mechanisms responsible
for hyperactivation of MYC and P70 by PPP2R2B
hypermethylation, immunoprecipitation assays were
performed. The results showed that the interaction of PP2A
(C subunit) with both MYC and P70 increased in resistant
cells (Figure 3C and S1A). We speculate that a PPP2R2B
deficiency can induce MYC and P70 phosphorylation
by impairing the binding of PP2A and MYC as well
as PP2A and P70, thus modulating nasopharyngeal
carcinoma resistance to BEZ235. To investigate this
hypothesis, PPP2R2B-deficient cells were established
in parental cells by knockdown of PPP2R2B. Compared
to the negative control, MYC and P70 phosphorylation
evens were significantly increased in response to the
knockdown of PPP2R2B (Figure 3D, and S1B). Moreover,
immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated a reduction of
the direct interaction between PP2A and MYC and between
PP2A and P70 in response to PPP2R2B knockdown
(Figure 3F and S1C). Furthermore, as we expected,
PPP2R2B knockdown attenuated BEZ235-induced growth
inhibition (Figure 3G and S1D). Taken together, silencing
of PPP2R2B by methylation correlated with MYC and P70
hyperphosphorylation and BEZ235 resistance.

PPP2R2B hypermethylation modulates MYC
and P70 phosphorylation to induce BEZ235
resistance
Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) functions as a
multimeric enzyme that contains the catalytic C subunit,
a scaffolding A subunit and a regulatory B subunit [25].
Various B regulatory subunits confer substrate specificity
for dephosphorylation events conducted by the C subunit
[26]. P70 and MYC have been previously identified to be
substrates of PP2A with the same B subunit called B55β,
which is encoded by the PPP2R2B gene [27]. Our results
showed that PPP2R2B promoter methylation correlated

Activation of the AKT/mTOR and PDK1/MYC
pathways drives resistance in cells with acquired
BEZ235 resistance

sensitized cells to BEZ235 treatment in two resistant
sublines (Figures 4E, 4F, S2E, S2F). These data indicate
an essential role of AKT/mTOR and PDK1/MYC
signaling activation in mediating acquired BEZ235
resistance in nasopharyngeal carcinoma.
The anticancer activity of the PDK1 inhibitor
GSK2334470 has been reported [28, 29]. In resistant cells,
GSK2334470 significantly induced a time-dependent
inhibition of MYC and P70 phosphorylation (Figure 4G
and S2G). The resistance mechanism induced by PDK1
activation prompted us to investigate the possibility that
GSK2334470 together with BEZ235 reverses BEZ235
resistance. Thus, we compared the effect of GSK2334470
on the cell viability of resistant cells as well as their parental
counterparts. The data showed that GSK2334470-induced
growth inhibition was much more effective in resistant cells
(Figure 4H and S2H). We examined whether GSK2334470
could sensitize BEZ235-resistant cells to the BEZ235
treatment. Indeed, the combination treatment considerably
increased BEZ235-mediated growth inhibition, especially
in resistant cells (Figures 4I, 4J, S2I, S2J). Together, these
data indicate that PDK1 activation and their downstream
signaling events (MYC and P70 activation) are involved
in BEZ235 resistance, which can be effectively blocked
with a PDK inhibitor. PDK1 inhibition by GSK2334470
sensitizes BEZ235-resistant cells to BEZ235.

We treated parental and resistant cells with
BEZ235 simultaneously. The results showed that
inhibition of the AKT/mTOR pathway by BEZ235 was
attenuated in resistant cells (Figure 4A and S2A). In
fact, we found a substantial upregulation of AKT/mTOR
and PDK1/MYC pathway activity in resistant sublines
compared with parental cell lines (Figure 4B and S2B),
suggesting that increased AKT/mTOR and PDK1/MYC
signaling may be acquired resistance mechanisms.
To determine whether AKT/mTOR and PDK1/MYC
signaling activation is sufficient to confer BEZ235
resistance, we modulated key proteins in the two
survival signaling pathways, such as PDK1, MYC and
P70, using siRNA in resistant cells. PDK1 knockdown
inhibited the phosphorylation of AKT, P70 and MYC
as well as PIM-1 protein expression in resistant cells
(Figure 4C and S2C). PDK1 knockdown universally
sensitized BEZ235-resistant cells to BEZ235 treatment
(Figure 4D and S2D). Next, we examined whether
siMYC and siP70 had a similar BEZ235 sensitization
effect in BEZ235-resistant cells. Compared with the
negative control, MYC and P70 knockdown by siRNA

PIM1 induces MYC phosphorylation to drive
BEZ235 resistance

researchers have developed the BRD4 inhibitor JQ-1
to target the transcriptional functions of MYC by
interfering with BRD4-induced MYC transcriptional
initiation and elongation [35–37]. In resistant cells,
JQ-1 induced a significant dose-dependent inhibition of
MYC phosphorylation (Figure 5E). Thus, we compared
the effect of JQ-1 on the cell viability of resistant cells
as well as their parental counterparts. The data showed
that JQ-1-induced growth inhibition was much more
effective in resistant cells than in parental cells that were
not resistant (Figure 5F). These data indicate that PIM1mediated MYC activation is critical in acquired BEZ235
resistance and that inhibition of MYC effectively inhibits
the growth of resistant cells.

To investigate a kinase downstream of PDK1
that is responsible for MYC induction, we evaluated
the expression of PIM1 and PLK1, which has been
reported to induce MYC phosphorylation [30–33].
Compared with parental lines, PIM1 but not PLK1
was overexpressed in the resistant cells (Figure 5A)
and could be suppressed by siPDK1 (Figure 4C). PIM1
stabilizes MYC by mediating MYC phosphorylation,
thus enhancing the transcriptional activity of c-MYC
and contributing to tumorigenesis. We next tested the
possibility that PIM1 interacts directly with MYC.
The results of the immunoprecipitation analysis
showed that PIM1 interacted directly with MYC in
resistant cells (Figure 5B). To elucidate the mechanism
by which PIM1 induced MYC phosphorylation in
resistant cells, we assessed MYC phosphorylation in
PIM1 knockdown cells by siRNA. PIM1 knockdown
substantially reduced MYC phosphorylation and
restored the sensitivity of these cells to BEZ235
treatment (Figures 5C and 5D). These data indicate that
PIM1 directly and specifically phosphorylates MYC
and thus confers BEZ235 resistance.
MYC is a master regulatory factor in BEZ235
resistance. Nevertheless, a therapeutic approach to
target MYC has remained elusive [27]. The absence of
a clear ligand-binding domain has posed a formidable
obstacle toward direct inhibition [34]. Therefore,

Inhibition of DNA methyltransferase activity
reverses BEZ235 resistance
DNA methylation is a classic epigenetic
modification in mammalian cells that involves the
addition of a methyl group to cytosine generally at
the CpG dinucleotide by DNA methyltransferases
(Dnmts), resulting in 5-methylcytosine (meC) [38]. The
mammalian DNMT family includes four active members:
DNMT1, DNMT2, DNMT3A, DNMT3B, and DNMT3L.
Mammalian DNMTs are responsible for methylation
pattern acquisition during tumor development [39].
Human DNMTs were coordinately upregulated at the
level of mRNA expression in BEZ235-resistant cells
(Figure 6A and S3A). Inhibition of DNMTs correlates

with a reduced tumorigenicity and increased expression
of tumor suppressor genes. The most commonly
used inhibitor, decitabine, is effective against several
cancers by blocking DNA methylation [40]. We next
examined whether decitabine is involved in PTEN and
PPP2R2B expression and thus in BEZ235 resistance.
The mRNA levels of the two genes were elevated in a
concentration-dependent manner following treatment
with decitabine (Figure 6B). Furthermore, decitabine
dephosphorylated key proteins in the AKT/mTOR and
PDK1/MYC pathways, such as AKT, GSK3β, MYC, P70,
and 4EBP-1, and upregulated PTEN protein expression
(Figure 6C and S3B). Moreover, immunoprecipitation
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

analysis demonstrated that the interaction between MYC
and PP2A and between P70 and PP2A were increased
(Figure 6D and S3C). These data indicate that inhibition
of methyltransferases enhances PTEN and PPP2R2B
gene expression and attenuates the AKT/mTOR and
PDK1/MYC pathways. Decitabine treatment clearly
induced growth inhibition in resistant cells (Figure 6E),
and the phenomenon can also be found in an alternative
methyltransferases inhibitor RG108 (Figure S4A).
In addition, methyltransferases inhibitors provided
a more effective sensitization of BEZ235-resistant
cells to BEZ235 treatment compared with the parental
cells (Figure 6F, 6G, S3D, S3E, S4B and S4C). These

were calculated (Figure 7C). Refractory tumors
displayed significant shrinkage after decitabine but not
BEZ235 treatment (Figure 7A and 7B). In the acquired

inhibited tumor growth compared with decitabine
alone (P = 0.03) (Figure 7A). Similar to the tumor

of the initial factor involved in multiple resistance
mechanisms may help researchers to rationally design new
combinatorial therapies.
In this study, we demonstrated that DNA
methyltransferase is a key modulator that can induce
PTEN and PPP2R2B gene hypermethylation, leading
to the downregulation of their expression in BEZ235resistant cancer cells. Reduced PTEN and PPP2R2B
expression correlated with activated AKT/mTOR and
PDK1/MYC pathways, which can confer considerable
BEZ235 resistance in nasopharyngeal carcinoma.

cells. This places DNMTs at a common signaling node for
various mechanisms underlying BEZ235 resistance. Thus,
we propose that rather than targeting each of the signaling
pathways individually, inhibition of this common key
node may effectively overcome BEZ235 resistance.
This new combination strategy warrants further clinical
investigation in patients with tumors carrying a PIK3CA
mutation or other factors that activate the PI3K/mTOR
pathway.
We tested whether the PDK1 inhibitor GSK2334470
could overcome BEZ235 resistance. In comparison
to BEZ235 plus GSK2334470 versus BEZ235 plus
decitabine, we observed that resistant cells were more
sensitive to decitabine, and the combination with
decitabine was more effective compared with the other
treatments in overcoming BEZ235 resistance (Figures 2J
and 6G). Although the phosphorylation of MYC and
P70 was blocked by GSK2334470, the enhanced
dephosphorylation of MYC and P70 by decitabine were
more pronounced in BEZ235-resistant cells.
In addition to the AKT/mTOR and PDK1/MYC
pathways, DNA methyltransferase also modulates
many downstream targets, including STAT1, STAT2,
STAT3, P21 and P16 [47, 48]. These signaling
pathways have diverse roles in regulating tumor cell
survival and metastasis. Decitabine affects DNMT
enzyme activity rather than its expression [49], which
induces genome-wide demethylation to significantly
increase the responses of tumor cells to treatment
with chemotherapeutic agents such as gemcitabine,
temozolomide [50] and cisplatin [40, 46, 51, 52]. This
attribute provides a possible application of decitabine
in cancer therapy in combination with other drugs.
Combinatorial therapy with BEZ235 and decitabine
could have a broad impact on tumor progression.
In conclusion, our studies identified DNA
methylation as a key convergent point of multiple BEZ235
resistance mechanisms. The combinatorial regimen of the
DNA methyltransferase inhibitor plus BEZ235 is effective
in overcoming acquired BEZ235 resistance. Our findings
may directly improve the outcomes of patients receiving
BEZ235 therapy in clinical trials.

In vivo studies
Female athymic BALB/c nude mice (4–6
weeks old) were purchased from Hunan Silaikejingda
Laboratory Animal Technology Co. Ltd (Changsha,
China). Mice were implanted subcutaneously in the
flank with 1 × 106 CNE2 cells. Tumors reached a size
of ~50 mm3, and serial establishment of refractory
xenografts was performed using xenograft tumors
formed from CNE2 cells. In brief, subcutaneous
tumors were excised and minced prior to subcutaneous
embedding into nude mice. When the tumors reached
~200 mm3, BEZ235 was administered po at 25 mg/kg
per day for 4 weeks. For two BEZ235 treatment cycles,
refractory xenografts were established by a repeated
embedding. When the tumors reached ~200 mm3, the
mice were divided into four groups (4 mice per group).
The BEZ235 was administered po at 25 mg/kg per day,
and decitabine was administered via intraperitoneal
injection at 0.03 mg/kg three times per week. Tumor
progress was monitored based on the whole body
weight and tumor size every 3–4 days following
injection. Tumor growth was followed for 4 weeks.
Animals were killed, and tumors were resected and
preserved at -80°C for Western blot and quantitative
RT-PCR analyses.
