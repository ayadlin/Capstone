Citrullination is the post-translational conversion of an arginine residue within a protein to the
non-coded amino acid citrulline1. This modification leads to the loss of a positive charge and
reduction in hydrogen bonding ability. It is carried out by a small family of tissue-specific
vertebrate enzymes called peptidylarginine deiminases (PADIs)2 and is associated with the
development of diverse pathological states such as autoimmunity, cancer, neurodegenerative
disorders, prion diseases and thrombosis2,3. Nonetheless, the physiological functions of
citrullination remain ill-defined, though citrullination of core histones has been linked to
transcriptional regulation and the DNA damage response4–8. PADI4 (or PAD4/PADV), the only
PADI with a nuclear localization signal9, was previously shown to act in myeloid cells where it
mediates profound chromatin decondensation during the innate immune response to infection10.
Here we show that the expression and enzymatic activity of PADI4 are also induced under
conditions of ground state pluripotency and during reprogramming. PADI4 is part of the
pluripotency transcriptional network, binding to regulatory elements of key stem cell genes and
activating their expression. Its inhibition lowers the percentage of pluripotent cells in the early
mouse embryo and significantly reduces reprogramming efficiency. Using an unbiased proteomic
approach we identify linker histone H1 variants, which are involved in the generation of compact
chromatin11, as novel PADI4 substrates. Citrullination of a single arginine residue within the DNA
binding site of H1 results in its displacement from chromatin and global chromatin
decondensation. Together, these results uncover a role for citrullination in the regulation of
pluripotency and provide new mechanistic insights into how citrullination regulates chromatin
compaction.

Pluripotent cells have the capacity to self-renew and differentiate into all somatic and germ
cell lineages and, hence, possess immense therapeutic potential for a multitude of medical
conditions. Their generation by reprogramming of differentiated somatic cells has been
achieved by nuclear transfer, cell fusion and transduction of transcription factors, such as
Oct4, Sox2, Klf4 and c-Myc12. Pluripotent cells have a distinctly open chromatin structure
that is essential for unrestricted developmental potential13,14 and reprogramming involves an
almost complete epigenetic resetting of somatic cells13. The ability of PADI4-mediated
histone citrullination to induce chromatin decondensation in neutrophils10 prompted us to
ask whether it can play a role in pluripotency, where chromatin decondensation is also
necessary. To investigate this we first assessed the expression of Padi4 in the embryonic
stem cell line ES Oct4-GIP (ES), the neural stem cell line NSO4G (NS) and in induced
pluripotent stem (iPS) cells derived NSO4G (see Methods). Padi4 is expressed in pluripotent
ES and iPS but not multipotent NS cells (Fig.1a). Culture of ES cells in 2i/LIF medium
establishes a ground state of pluripotency15. This leads to the down-regulation of lineage
specific markers and the up-regulation of pluripotency factors, as well as rapid induction of
Padi4 (Fig. 1b). The pattern of Padi4 expression follows closely that of Nanog, an essential
transcription factor for the transition to ground state pluripotency16(Fig 1a,b). While other
PADIs are expressed in pluripotent cells, PADI4 is the only one whose expression clearly
associates with naïve pluripotency (Extended Data Fig. 1a,b). Citrullination of histone H3
(H3Cit), a modification shown previously to be carried out specifically by PADI417, is
detectable in ES and iPS cells (Extended Data Fig. 1c), indicating that PADI4 is also
enzymatically active. H3 and global citrullination are undetectable in NS cells (Extended
Data Fig. 1c,d).

To determine the kinetics of PADI4 activation during the establishment of pluripotency, we
examined RNA and protein samples collected daily during the course of reprogramming of
NSO4G into iPS cells16. Padi4 is rapidly induced in NS cells after transduction of
reprogramming factors but only becomes active to citrullinate H3 after introduction of 2i/
LIF, closely following the onset of Nanog expression (Fig. 1c). These observations strongly
suggested that PADI4 activity is associated with ground state pluripotency and prompted us
to examine whether Padi4 is part of the pluripotency transcriptional network.

First, we asked whether the reprogramming factors regulate Padi4 expression, utilizing the
ZHBTc4.1 and 2TS22C cell lines where Oct4 and Sox2, respectively, can be deleted acutely
in response to doxycycline treatment (see Methods). Deletion of Oct4, but not Sox2, led to a
decrease in Padi4 mRNA levels (Extended Data Fig. 1e). Furthermore, while Oct4 and Klf4
occupy the Padi4 promoter in ES, but not NS cells, Sox2 is bound in both cell types
(Extended Data Fig. 1f). To understand the effects of PADI4 on transcriptional regulation in
pluripotent cells, we analyzed the transcriptome of ES cells upon PADI4 over-expression
and inhibition. Several key pluripotency genes are up-regulated in response to PADI4 overexpression (Fig. 1d, Extended Data Figure 2a and Supplementary Table 2), including Klf2,
Tcl1, Tcfap2c, and Kit. Tcl1 was previously identified as the only regulator of self-renewal
up-regulated in ground state pluripotency15 and over-expression of Tcl1 or Tcfap2c
positively influence this process18. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis of this dataset indicates an
enrichment of genes involved in stem cell development and maintenance (Fig. 1e). In
addition, knockdown of Padi4 in mES cells leads to decreased expression of Tcl1 and
Nanog, which is rescued by exogenous expression of RNAi-resistant human PADI4 (Fig. 1f,
Extended Data Fig. 2b,c). These genes are under the control of PADI4 enzymatic activity
since treatment with the chemical inhibitor Cl-amidine, which disrupts citrullination by
PADI419, down-regulates their expression (Fig. 1g). Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)
analysis indicated that H3Cit is present on regulatory regions of Tcl1 and Nanog in ES and
iPS cells, but not NS cells (Fig. 1h and Extended Data Fig. 3a). Accordingly, exogenously
expressed human PADI4 localizes to and is enzymatically active on these regions, as well as
regulatory regions of Klf2 and Kit in ES cells (Extended Data Fig. 3b,c). In contrast to
PADI4 over-expression, treatment of ES cells with Cl-amidine led to up-regulation of
differentiation markers such as Prickle1, EphA1 and Wnt8a and down-regulation of
pluripotency markers such as Klf5 (Extended Data Fig. 4a,b, and Supplementary Table 3), in
addition to Nanog and Tcl1 (Fig. 1g). GO analysis of this dataset indicated enrichment in
genes involved in cell differentiation (Extended Data Fig. 4c). Pou5f1 (Oct4), Klf4, Sox2
and c-Myc, were not affected by PADI4 modulation (Extended Data Fig. 2a and
Supplementary Tables 2 and 3). Cumulatively, the above results place PADI4 within the
pluripotency transcriptional network, suggesting that it acts downstream of some of the
cardinal reprogramming factors to regulate a specific subset of pluripotency genes.
Prompted by the above observations, we investigated whether PADI4 is necessary for
pluripotency, as assessed during reprogramming (Extended Data Fig. 5a) and in the early
stages of embryo development. NSO4G cells express a GFP reporter under the control of the
Oct4 regulatory sequences, which is activated upon acquisition of pluripotency16, allowing
us to trace reprogrammed cells. Knock-down of Padi4 in NSO4G-derived pre-iPS cells
impaired the ability of the cells to establish H3Cit upon switch to 2i/LIF medium and led to

a clear reduction in reprogramming (Fig. 2a,b, Extended Data Fig. 5b-e and Extended Data
time-lapse video). Consistent with this, levels of Tcl1 and Nanog were not elevated upon
reprogramming to the same extent as in control cells (Fig. 2b and Extended Data Fig. 5f).
Cl-amidine treatment led to a dramatic reduction of reprogramming efficiency and H3Cit
(Fig. 2c and Extended Data Fig. 5g-i), suggesting that the catalytic activity of PADI4 is
important for the induction of pluripotency.

Padi4 expression and H3Cit are detected in the early embryo20,21 and Padi4-null mice are
born in lower numbers than would be expected by Mendelian inheritance22, suggesting that
PADI4 loss affects embryonic development. To assess the role of PADI4 in early
development, we cultured mouse embryos in Cl-amidine-containing medium from the 2-cell
stage and throughout pre-implantation development (see Methods and Extended Data Fig.
6a-c). Using 200µM Cl-amidine resulted in a complete developmental arrest of the embryos
at the 8-cell stage (Extended Data Fig. 6a). We therefore used the maximum dose of Clamidine that reduced H3Cit (Extended Data Fig. S6b,c) but did not induce arrest (10µM).
This led to a reduced percentage of pluripotent Nanog-positive epiblast cells and an
increased percentage of differentiated trophectoderm cells at the blastocyst stage (Fig. 2d,e
and Extended Data Fig. 6d,e). Time-course analyses of the cleavage patterns and cell fate
decisions in early embryos showed that Cl-amidine increased the number of symmetric cell
divisions at the expense of asymmetric divisions at the 8 to 16- and 16 to 32-cell transitions
(Fig. 2f,g). This resulted in 16-cell stage embryos with fewer inner cells (destined for
pluripotency) and greater numbers of outer cells (destined for differentiation into
trophectoderm, reviewed in 23) (Extended Data Fig. 6f). Treatment with another PADI4
inhibitor, TDFA24, but not the HDAC inhibitor TSA, had similar effects (Extended Data Fig.
7, 8). These results indicate that PADI4 activity also promotes the maintenance of
pluripotent cells in the early mouse embryo.

To elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which PADI4 regulates pluripotency, we aimed to
identify PADI4 substrates in the chromatin fraction of mES cells using Stable Isotope
Labeling of Amino acids in Cell culture (SILAC) (Fig. 3a and Extended Data Fig. 9a,b).
Among the identified PADI4 substrates were Atrx, Dnmt3b, Trim28 and variants of linker
histone H1 (Fig. 3b-e, Extended Data Fig. S9c-f, S10 and Supplementary Table 4), all of
which can impact pluripotency. Histone H1 stabilizes the nucleosome and facilitates
chromatin condensation, a state that is less permissive to processes that require access to the
DNA, such as transcription11. The identified citrullinated H1 peptides correspond to, and are
common between, variants H1.2, H1.3 and H1.4 (Fig. 3d,e), while an additional peptide
corresponds to the same residue in H1.5 (Extended Data Fig. 10a,b). In ES cells, H1.2, H1.3
and H1.4 are required for chromatin compaction25, while their depletion leads to increased
expression of pluripotency genes such as Nanog and stalls them in a self-renewal state with
impaired differentiation capability26. Notably, H1 is more loosely bound to chromatin in ES
cells than in differentiated cells14 and its genomic localization in cancer cells was shown to
anti-correlate with that of PADI47.
Mass spectrometric analysis accounted for all arginine residues within H1 but indicated that
Arg54 (H1R54) is the only site citrullinated by PADI4 (Fig. 3e and Extended Data Fig. 9c).
Indeed, we found that while H1.2 is citrullinated in ES cells (already by endogenous PADI4,

and significantly increased upon PADI4 over-expression), it is refractory to modification
when Arg54 is mutated (Fig. 3f). Similar results were obtained in in vitro citrullination
assays (Extended Data Fig. 11a). H1R54 lies within the globular domain of H1 (Extended
Data Fig. 11b), which is highly conserved among the linker histone family and is necessary
for interaction with nucleosomal DNA27,28. To test whether H1R54 is necessary for binding
of H1 to nucleosomes, we mutated and assessed it in nucleosome-binding assays. Figure 3g
shows that an R54A mutant, which mimics the charge change that accompanies
citrullination, is impaired for nucleosome binding. An R54K mutant, which retains the
positive charge, is impaired to a lesser extend (Fig. 3g) suggesting that H1R54 is important
for electrostatic interactions between H1.2 and the nucleosome.

The above results open up the possibility that PADI4 may affect chromatin compaction in
pluripotent cells. To test this hypothesis, we first assessed whether citrullination by ectopic
PADI4 can lead to decondensation of differentiated cell chromatin. Recombinant PADI4 was
added to permeabilized and stabilized differentiated C2C12 mouse myoblast nuclei (Fig.
4a). This protocol ensures stabilization of the nuclear component while allowing the free
diffusion of non-chromatin bound nuclear proteins into the extra-nuclear fraction, and their
collection by washing. Incubation with active PADI4 (Extended Data Fig. 12a,b), leads to
the eviction of H1 from the chromatin and its diffusion out of the permeabilized nucleus
(Fig. 4b). The evicted H1 is citrullinated on R54, as determined by mass spectrometry
(Extended Data Figure 12c,d). Consistent with this, PADI4-treated cells showed evidence of
decondensed chromatin, as determined by nuclear swelling, diffuse DAPI staining and
increased sensitivity to micrococcal nuclease (Fig. 4c,d and Extended Data Figure 12e).
Similar results were observed when PADI4 was over-expressed in C2C12 cells (Fig. 4e) or
NS cells (data not shown). To monitor if PADI4 can affect H1 binding on pluripotent cell
chromatin, we performed ChIP-qPCR analyses of H1.2 on the regulatory regions of Tcl1
and Nanog and found that it is stabilized upon Padi4 knockdown (Fig. 4f). The ability of
PADI4 to disrupt the binding of H1 to nucleosomal DNA provides a novel mechanistic
example of how citrullination regulates protein function and chromatin condensation.
The work described above identifies citrullination of chromatin components by PADI4 as a
feature of pluripotency (Fig. 4g), in addition to its previously described role in the myeloid
lineage. One of the reasons for the restricted expression pattern of PADI4 may be the
requirement for an open chromatin state in these cell types. The selective expression
characteristics and the inducible nature of the catalytic activity of PADI4, suggest that it is
under tight spatial and temporal regulation, giving it a unique status among chromatin
modifying enzymes. As such, inappropriate PADI4 activity may have deleterious
consequences, which may explain its activation in cancers of varying origin during
progression to malignancy29. Indeed, citrullination is a common feature of several unrelated
diseases, suggesting that strict regulation is likely to be a requirement for the physiological
function of all PADIs. During review of this manuscript, Coonrod and colleagues suggested
that PADI2, thought to be mainly cytoplasmic, can also citrullinate histones and lead to
transcriptional activation30. This opens the intriguing possibility that other PADIs may
mediate nuclear events in specific contexts, including in pluripotent cells. Further research
into the function and targets of PADIs is likely to shed light into the etiology of several
pathologies.
