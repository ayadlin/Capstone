ABSTRACT
Bone morphogenetic protein receptor type IB (BMPRIB) is one osteogenesis factor,
which function in breast cancer has been rarely explored until recently. In the clinical
study presented here, involving a cohort of 368 invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) patients,
we identified that patients with low expression of BMPRIB exhibited poor prognosis,
especially in the luminal B subtype. We also provided the first piece of evidence that
low level of BMPRIB was a promoting factor for breast cancer patients to develop bone
metastasis, but not lung, liver or brain. The first of its kind, we reported that patients
with high expression of BMPRIB exhibited favorable prognosis by a retrospective
analysis consisting of 168 patients treated with TE (taxane and anthracycline) regimens.
And the patients with high expression of BMPRIB were more sensitive to TE regimens in
the detection of 32 paired pre-neoadjuvant and post-neoadjuvant specimens. Overall,
our study concluded that low expression of BMPRIB indicated poor prognosis of breast
cancer and was insensitive to taxane-anthracycline chemotherapy. Our findings also
lay a foundation to help clinicians improve identification of patients for TE regimens by
BMPRIB in the era of precision medicine.

normal, benign specimens and well-differentiated tumors
compared with poorly-differentiated tumors in human
prostate cancer, glioma, and ovarian cancer [8-12].
Reports of BMPRIB in breast cancer are few and
contradictory [5, 13]. It was reported high expression of
BMPRIB indicated a poor prognosis in estrogen receptorpositive breast cancer patients [13]. However, Bokobza et
al.’s study presented an opposite conclusion in prognosis
[5]. Such confused reports were probably due to small
samples or unscientific division. Until present, there is still
no comprehensive description which is capable of pointing
out the accurate relationship between BMPRIB and breast
cancer, particularly distant metastasis.

INTRODUCTION
Breast cancer is a common cancer in women and a
major cause of cancer death among women of all races and
populations, due to the development of secondary tumors
in vital organs [1]. First metastatic lesions are found at the
highest frequency in bone (83%) whereas liver and lung
are usually affected to a lesser extent (27%) [2-3].
Bone morphogenetic protein receptor type IB
(BMPRIB) as a member of BMPRs, could lead to the
activation of intracellular signaling pathways and inhibited
cell proliferation, migration, and invasiveness [4-7]. It has
been reported that BMPRIB expression was higher in the

In our present clinicopathologic study, we presented
immunohistochemistry analysis of BMPRIB expression in a
large population of 368 cases of invasive ductal carcinoma
(IDC), which covered all molecular subtypes. We confirmed
that low expression of BMPRIB predicted poor prognosis
in IDC patients. In addition, we found that IDC patients
with low expression of BMPRIB exhibited bone-specific
metastasis, but not lung, liver or brain. Furthermore, we
reported firstly that high level of BMPRIB expression
predicted a favorable prognosis in patients treated with TE
(taxane and anthracycline) regimens. Patients with high
expression of BMPRIB were more sensitive to TE regimens
which was validated by detecting 32 paired pre-neoadjuvant
and post-neoadjuvant specimens. Overall, our findings

demonstrated that low expression of BMPRIB indicated
poor prognosis of breast cancer and was insensitive to
taxane-anthracycline chemotherapy.

RESULTS
Low expression of BMPRIB promoted breast
cancer progression
Expression of BMPRIB was detected in 52 cases of
non-neoplastic tissues adjacent to tumor, 40 cases of DCIS
and 368 cases of IDC. The immunohistochemical staining
of BMPRIB was assessed and the intensity of staining was
shown in representative images as Figure 1A. In breast

tissues, BMPRIB was mainly located in the cytoplasm of
epithelial cells of the mammary gland ducts. We found
the expression of BMPRIB was gradually down-regulated
from non-neoplastic tissues adjacent to tumor, to DCIS
and to IDC (Figure 1B). 26.9% (14/52) of non-neoplastic
tissues adjacent to tumor, 55.0% (22/40) of DCIS and
60.3% (222/368) of IDC tissue specimens showed low
expression of BMPRIB (rs = -0.184, P < 0.001) (Table
1). Furthermore, Western blot analyses were employed to
show the protein expression of BMPRIB in frozen IDC
specimens (13 cases) and non-neoplastic breast specimens
(13 cases), respectively. We confirmed that expression of
BMPRIB was lower in IDC specimens compared with
non-neoplastic breast specimens (Figure 1C). We also
examined BMPRIB expression in paraffin sections and
each section contained both non-neoplasm and tumor.
The typical immunohistochemistry images of BMPRIB
expression in two cases were shown in Figure 1D.
BMPRIB expression was negatively correlated with
tumor size (rs = -0.190, P < 0.001), cTNM stage (rs =
-0.126, P = 0.016), lymph node metastasis (rs = -0.202, P
< 0.001) and distant metastasis (rs = -0.148, P = 0.004) but
positively associated with the expression of PR (rs = 0.210,
P < 0.001) of breast cancer. No significant associations
were identified between the expression of BMPRIB and
patients’ age (rs = -0.056, P = 0.286), histological grade (rs
= 0.038, P = 0.472), ER (rs = 0.064, P = 0.223), or HER2
(rs = 0.016, P = 0.758) (Table 2).

than that of patients with high expression of BMPRIB
(Figure 2C, 2D).
Kaplan-Meier analysis of triple negative subtype (56
cases) showed that the expression of BMPRIB was not
correlated with PFS (P = 0.124, Figure 2E) or OS (P =
0.315, Figure 2F). Then we investigated the correlation
between BMPRIB and prognosis in non-triple negative
subtype patients (n = 301). Kaplan-Meier analysis
showed that low expression of BMPRIB indicated shorter
PFS (P = 0.003, Figure 2G) and OS (P = 0.015, Figure
2H). In the following, we divided non-triple negative
cases into two groups: luminal subtype (278 cases) and
HER2-overexpression subtype (23 cases). We found no
correlation between BMPRIB and PFS (P = 0.228, Figure
2K) or OS (P = 0.225, Figure 2L) in HER2-overexpression
subtype. However, Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that
low expression of BMPRIB indicated shorter PFS (P =
0.005, Figure 2I) and OS (P = 0.039, Figure 2J) in luminal
subtype, especially in luminal B subtype (PFS: P = 0.008;
OS: P = 0.036; Figure 3).

Low level of BMPRIB was a promoting factor
for breast cancer patients to develop bone
metastasis
In the present study, we found a negative correlation
between expression of BMPRIB and bone metastasis in
357 IDC patients (rs = -0.119, P = 0.024). No correlations
were identified between BMPRIB expression and distant
metastasis to other organs, such as lung (rs = -0.056, P =
0.289), liver (rs = -0.036, P = 0.500) and brain (rs = -0.048,
P = 0.364, only 5 cases, data not shown) (Table 3).
To further investigate the relationship between
BMPRIB expression and breast cancer bone metastasis,
357 IDC patients were divided into 2 groups: breast cancer
with bone metastasis (n = 39) and without bone metastasis
(n = 318). Expression of BMPRIB of breast cancer patients
with bone metastasis was lower than that without bone
metastasis (Figure 4A). The median H score of BMPRIB
(110.0) of patients with bone metastasis was lower than
that (130.0) without bone metastasis (P = 0.008, Figure
4B). In triple negative patients, BMPRIB expression in the
group with bone metastasis (median, 100.0) was similar to
that without bone metastasis (median, 120.0) (P = 0.185,

Low expression of BMPRIB in IDC patients
indicated worse prognosis
In order to explore the role of BMPRIB in breast
cancer prognosis, we analyzed 357 IDC patients with
complete clinical follow-up. We found BMPRIB
expression in patients with metastasis, recurrence or death
within 5 years (H score: 60.0 to 180.0, median: 100.0) was
lower than those who were disease-free over 5 years (H
score: 80.0 to 200.0, median: 130.0) (P < 0.001, Figure
2A). Cases with low BMPRIB expression were 87.5%
(42/48) and 51.4% (74/144) in metastasis, recurrence or
death within 5 years group and disease-free over 5 years
group (P < 0.001) (Figure 2B). Both PFS and OS in IDC
patients with low expression of BMPRIB were shorter

Next, we analyzed the interval time from diagnosis
of breast cancer to bone metastasis and from diagnosis of
bone metastasis to the follow-up ending time respectively
in the 39 IDC patients with bone metastasis. IDC patients
with low BMPRIB expression exhibited a trend for shorter
time (median 30.0 months) to develop bone metastasis
than those (median 60.0 months) with high expression (P

= 0.011, Figure 4F). Furthermore, the interval time from
diagnosis of bone metastasis to the follow-up ending time
exhibited the same trend. Low BMPRIB expression has
the potential for a reduced survival compared with those
with high expression, and the median interval time were
13.0 months and 25.0 months, respectively (P = 0.016,

of BMPRIB predicted a favorable outcome in breast

BMPRIB and OS in luminal subtype (123 cases, P =

It was reported that docetaxel treatment was
associated with expression of BMPRIB. Docetaxel
(analogs of taxane) could reduce the expression of
β1-integrin and then activated BMP signaling by upregulating SMAD1/5/8 and p38 leading to an increased
expression of BMPRIB [14-16]. In the following
experiments, we examined the relationship of BMPRIB
and taxane combined anthracycline (TE) based therapies.
We analyzed the BMPRIB expression with patient
prognosis using the immunohistochemcal system in
conventional TE-based regimens. Among 357 cases, 168
(47.1%) patients received TE-based chemotherapy and
BMPRIB expression in patients (29 cases) who developed
metastasis, recurrence or death within 5 years was lower
(median, 100.0) than those (67 cases) who were diseasefree over 5 years (median, 130.0) (P = 0.002, Figure
5A). Percentages of cases with low BMPRIB expression
were 96.6% (28/29) and 59.7% (40/67) in patients who
developed metastasis, recurrence or death within 5
years and patients who were disease-free over 5 years,
respectively (χ2 = 13.303, P < 0.001) (Figure 5B).
Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that low expression
of BMPRIB indicated shorter PFS (P = 0.015, Figure 5C)
and OS (P = 0.023, Figure 5D) in patients who received
TE-based therapies and followed up with a median of 60
months (5-120 months). We found no correlation between
the expression of BMPRIB and OS (P = 0.072, Figure 5F)
in patients (189 cases) who received other chemotherapy,
although low expression of BMPRIB indicated a shorter
PFS (P=0.030, Figure 5E). It demonstrated that high
expression of BMPRIB indicated a favorable prognosis
in patients who received TE-based therapies. Among 168
TE-based cases, we assessed the prognosis in different

Patients with low expression of BMPRIB were
insensitive to TE regimens
We also randomly selected another cohort of patients
(32 cases) hospitalized during 2005 to 2009 and they were
diagnosed with invasive breast cancer using core needle
biopsy and then treated with TE combined chemotherapy
before surgery. We divided 32 patients into positive
pathological response group and negative pathological
response group, on the basis of postoperative pathology.
We found BMPRIB expression was higher (median, 100)
in positive pathological response group (20 cases) than
that (median, 80) of negative pathological response group
(12 cases) in core needle biopsy specimens before TE
treatment (Figure 6A, 6B; P = 0.040).
We found the expression of BMPRIB increased
after TE neoadjuvant chemotherapy by using 32 paired
specimens of pre- and post-neoadjuvant chemotherapy.
Mann-Whitney U analysis showed that the median H score
of BMPRIB in pre-neoadjuvant chemotherapy specimens
(median: 100.0) was lower than that in post-neoadjuvant
chemotherapy specimens (median: 130.0) (P < 0.001,

expression were 87.5% (28/32) and 59.4% (19/32) in
groups of pre-neoadjuvant chemotherapy specimens
and the post-neoadjuvant chemotherapy specimens,
respectively (P = 0.007, Table 4). In positive pathological
response group, 80.0% (16/20) of pre-neoadjuvant
chemotherapy specimens showed low expression of
BMPRIB, which was higher than that (50.0%, 10/20) of
the post-neoadjuvant chemotherapy specimens (P = 0.034,

findings in breast cancer [28].
Overall, our study concluded that low expression of
BMPRIB indicated poor prognosis of breast cancer and
was insensitive to taxane-anthracycline chemotherapy. Our
findings also lay a foundation to help clinicians improve
identification of patients for TE regimens by BMPRIB in
the era of precision medicine.

DISCUSSION
Multiple factors were reported to participate in
breast cancer bone metastasis [17-23]. Buijs et al. showed
that high expression of BMP 7 (a member of BMP family)
inhibited the formation of bone metastases in breast
cancer patients [24]. Lewis et al. found loss of BMPRIB
induced increased expression of cytokeratin17, which is
a promoting factor of invasion [6]. In our present study,
novel evidence is provided that low level of BMPRIB was
a promoting factor for breast cancer patients to develop
bone metastasis, but not lung, liver or brain.
TE-based therapies are part of the standard of care
in first line treatment of metastatic breast cancer and their
clinical use is widespread [25-26]. Actually, only about
15% patients could achieve pathologic complete response,
thus a more detailed classification is necessary to screen a
more suitable population to TE regimens [27]. A potential
predictor of response to TE chemotherapy is urgently
needed.
We reported for the first time that high BMPRIB
expression was sensitive to TE-based chemotherapy by
two cohorts of population. The survival analysis revealed
that low expression of BMPRIB indicated a poor prognosis
in 168 TE-based patients. In addition, by 32 paired preand post-neoadjuvant chemotherapy specimens, patients
with low BMPRIB expression were insensitive to TE
neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Dzietczenia et al. found that
leukemia patients with a complete or partial response
to anthracyclines-based chemotherapy exhibited higher

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient selection and clinical information
Paraffin-embedded specimens of 368 breast cancer
patients with invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC), diagnosed
between 2004 and 2009, together with 40 cases of breast
ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and 52 cases of nonneoplastic tissues were reviewed and randomly selected
from the archives of the Department of Breast Cancer
Pathology and Research Laboratory, Tianjin Medical
University Cancer Institute & Hospital (Tianjin, China)
for this study. The histopathology was reviewed and
diagnosis in each case was confirmed independently by
two pathologists according to World Health Organization
(WHO) criteria. This study was reviewed and approved
by the Institutional Ethic Committee of Tianjin Medical
University Cancer Institute & Hospital. All the patients
signed an informed consent for participation of the study
and the use of their biological tissues.
368 IDC patients were women aging from 28
to 89 years (mean 51.5 years) without preoperative
chemotherapy or radiation. A total of 357 cases were
included for prognostic analyses, excluding cases with no
follow-up data (11 cases). These patients were followed up
with a median of 59 months (3-180 months). Recurrences

and distant metastasis were recorded for 20 (5.4%) cases
and 51 (13.9%) cases respectively, and 32 (8.7%) patients
died. Among 357 cases, 278 (77.9%) patients were luminal
subtype, 23 (6.4%) patients were HER2-overexpression
subtype and 56 (15.7%) were triple negative subtype.
168 (47.1%) patients received TE (taxane +
anthracycline) based chemotherapies, the rest (189
cases, 52.9%) were treated with other chemotherapies
(not TE-based therapies) after operation. The details
of patients who received non-TE based chemotherapy
were in the following: 86 cases (CEF/CAF); 76 cases
(CMF); 7 cases (Platinum-based chemotherapy); 4 cases
(Taxane); 16 cases (unknown). (CEF: Cyclophosphamide,
epirubicin and 5-fluorouracil; CAF: Cyclophosphamide,
doxorubicin and 5-fluorouracil; CMF: Cyclophosphamide,
methotrexate and 5-fluorouracil)

tumor tissues. All specimens were immediately fixed
in 10% normal-buffered formalin and embedded in
paraffin and stained for the presence of BMPRIB by
immunohistochemistry.
The pathological response to neoadjuvant
chemotherapy was evaluated after surgical resection of
the remaining tumor and assessed according to Miller and
Payne histological grading system: grade 1, no change
or some alteration to individual malignant cells but no
reduction in overall cellularity; grade 2, minor loss (up to
30%) of cancer cells but overall cellularity remains high;
grade 3, reduction of 30% to 90% of cancer cells; grade
4, more than 90% loss of cancer cells but small clusters or
widely dispersed individual cancer cells remain; grade 5,
no malignant cells identifiable in sections from the site of
the tumor consisting of vascular fibroblastic stroma, often
containing macrophages; however, ductal carcinoma in
situ (DCIS) may be present [29]. Of these 32 patients,
there were 12 grade 1 responses, 9 grade 2 responses, 7
grade 3 responses and 4 grade 4 responses, but no grade 5
responses. In this study, the 32 patients were divided into
two groups: one group was pathological response grade
2 to 4 which was regarded as positive and another group
was pathological response grade 1 which was regarded as
negative.

Patients’ prognostic information
Among 357 patients with prognostic analyses,
there were 48 developed metastases, recurrence or death
within 5 years; while 144 patients were disease-free over
5 years since diagnosis of breast cancer. Among patients
who received TE-based regimens, 29 patients developed
metastasis, recurrence or death within 5 years; while 67
patients who were disease-free over 5 years.
Among 357 patients with prognostic analyses, there
were 51 who developed distant metastasis during the
follow-up period, 39 patients developed bone metastasis,
12 patients developed lung metastasis, 13 patients
developed liver metastasis, 5 patients developed brain
metastasis, 2 patients developed uterus metastasis and 3
additional cases developed kidney, ovarian and thyroid
metastasis, respectively. It was worth noting that multiple
organic metastases were noted in 14 patients. Among those
39 IDC patients with bone metastasis, 30 patients were
luminal subtype, 1 patient was HER2-overexpression
subtype and 8 were triple-negative subtype.

Immunohistochemical staining
BMPRIB expression was examined by
histochemistry techniques and S-P method. In brief,
Sections (5μm thick) were dewaxed, hydrated, and heated
for 2.5 min for antigen retrieval in a conventional pressure
cooker by using citrate buffer, pH 6.0. Then sections were
treated with 3% H2O2 for 20 min to reduce endogenous
activity and incubated with 10% normal goat serum for 20
min to eliminate nonspecific staining. Next, the primary
antibody against BMPRIB (rabbit anti-human polyclonal
antibody, Santa Cruz, USA, sc-25455, 1:100) was applied
at 4°C overnight. After washing, biotin labeled secondary
antibody against rabbit immunoglobulin was applied for
20 min at room temperature. The slides were rinsed and
covered with streptavidin-biotin-peroxidase for 20 min.
All sections were stained with 3,3’-diaminobenzidinetetrahydrochloride (DAB). Slides were counterstained with
hematoxylin and mounted for light microscopy.

Information of 32 paired specimens from
pre-neoadjuvant and post-neoadjuvant
chemotherapy
We also randomly selected another cohort of
patients (32 cases) hospitalized during October 2005 to
June 2009. All 32 patients were diagnosed with invasive
breast cancer by 14-gauge core needle biopsy and then had
completed with preoperative neoadjuvant chemotherapy
consisted of 2 to 8 cycles of TE combined chemotherapy
regimen without other local or systemic treatment before
surgery. Patients were women 28 to 71 years of age (mean
age 52.6 years) and had no other malignant tumors or
tumor history. The distribution of clinical involvement
showed that all the patients had tumors >2.0 cm. These 32
paired specimens were collected from each patient’s core
needle biopsy specimens of primary breast tumor before
neoadjuvant chemotherapy and its matching postoperative

Evaluation of staining
Using light microscopy, stained tissue sections
were reviewed by two pathologists in a blinded manner. A
consensus judgment was adopted for the intensity score of
the tumors based on the strength of BMPRIB expression.
0 (-): no or low staining; 1 (+): moderate staining; 2 (++):
strong staining. Percentage of the positive staining was
scored as 0-100. An immunohistochemical score (H score)
was ranged from 0 to 200 by multiplying the intensity
and the percentage score. Patients were categorized into
4782

Oncotarget

groups according to H score of BMPRIB: low BMPRIB
expression (0-140), high BMPRIB expression (141-200).
Immunohistochemistry for estrogen receptor
(ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) was re-evaluated
using the 2010 American Society of Clinical Oncology/
College of American Pathologists (ASCO/CAP) guideline.
Cases were scored positive for ER and PR if nuclear
immunoreactivity was present in more than 1% of tumor
cells [30]. Immunohistochemistry for human epidermal
growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) was re-evaluated using
the 2014 ASCO/CAP updated guideline [31].

Western blot
Western blot analysis was performed to evaluate
the expression of BMPRIB in both non-neoplastic breast
tissues adjacent to tumor and breast tumor tissues. Frozen
breast tumor specimens (13 cases) and non-neoplastic
breast tissues adjacent to tumor (13 cases) were collected
between 2012 and 2015. All patients were women without
preoperative chemotherapy or radiation. Tissues were
lysed in 1×SDS lysis buffer (Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 62.5 mM,
2% SDS, 10% glycerol) for 60 minutes on ice directly.
Equal amounts of protein were separated by SDS-PAGE,
and electrotransferred onto nitrocellulose membranes.
Blots were analyzed by LiCor Odyssey infrared imaging.

Statistical methods
The SPSS 13.0 software package (SPSS, Chicago,
IL, USA) was used for statistical analysis. Mann-Whitney
U test and χ2 test were performed for group comparisons
and correlations between two variables were evaluated
by Spearman rank correlation test. The relation between
BMPRIB expression and distant metastasis was evaluated
using Spearman rank correlation test. Progression-free
survival (PFS) was defined as the time from surgery
to recurrence or cancer-specific death, whichever
occurred first. Overall survival (OS) was calculated from
pathological diagnosis to the date of last contact or death
from breast carcinoma. Survival analyses were performed
according to the Kaplan-Meier method. Wilcoxon matched
pairs signed rank test was performed for analyzing the
expression of BMPRIB in 32 paired specimens. All
statistical tests were 2-tailed and P < 0.05 was regarded
as significant.
