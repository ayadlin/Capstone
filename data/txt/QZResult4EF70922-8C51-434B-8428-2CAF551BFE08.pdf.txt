Abstract
BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) have dramatically improved therapy for chronic myelogenous
leukemia (CML). However, several problems leading to TKI resistance still impede a complete cure of this disease.
IFN regulatory factor-8 (IRF8) is a transcription factor essential for the development and functions of immune
cells, including dendritic cells. Irf8/ mice develop a CML-like disease and IRF8 expression is downregulated in
patients with CML, suggesting that IRF8 is involved in the pathogenesis of CML. In this study, by using a murine
CML model, we show that BCR-ABL strongly inhibits a generation of dendritic cells from an early stage of their
differentiation in vivo, concomitant with suppression of Irf8 expression. Forced expression of IRF8 overrode BCRABL (both wild-type and T315I-mutated) to rescue dendritic cell development in vitro, indicating that the
suppression of Irf8 causes dendritic cell deﬁciency. Gene expression proﬁling revealed that IRF8 restored the
expression of a signiﬁcant portion of BCR-ABL–dysregulated genes and predicted that BCR-ABL has immunestimulatory potential. Indeed, IRF8-rescued BCR-ABL–expressing dendritic cells were capable of inducing CTLs
more efﬁciently than control dendritic cells. Altogether, our ﬁndings suggest that IRF8 is an attractive target in
next-generation therapies for CML. Cancer Res; 73(22); 6642–53. 2013 AACR.

Introduction
Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) is a myeloproliferative disorder that accounts for approximately 15% of newly
diagnosed cases of adult leukemia (1, 2). The causal molecule of
this disease is BCR-ABL, a 210 kDa oncoprotein encoded by the
BCR-ABL fusion gene, which is generated by a t(9;22) chromosomal translocation (3). BCR-ABL possesses deregulated ABL
tyrosine kinase activity that stimulates many downstream
signals including the MYC, NF-kB, RAS, mitogen-activated
protein kinase, phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), and STAT
pathways. These signals lead to stimulation of cell proliferation, inhibition of apoptosis, and alteration of adhesion to
stroma cells and extracellular matrix. CML begins with a

chronic phase in which clonal BCR-ABLþ hematopoietic stem
cells give rise to increased numbers of their progenies, particularly myeloid precursors and mature cells (mainly neutrophils) in the bone marrow, blood, and extramedullary tissues.
After 3 to 5 years, if not treated, the disease progresses into a
fatal blast crisis, characterized by accumulation of immature
precursor cells with differentiation arrest.
During the last decade, therapy with BCR-ABL–selective
tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), such as imatinib, nilotinib, and
dasatinib, has greatly improved the prognosis of patients with
CML (4). However, several problems still impede a complete
cure of this disease. First, a minor but signiﬁcant subset of
patients fails to respond to or becomes resistant to TKIs mainly
due to acquisition of point mutations in the ABL gene, such as
T315I. Second, because leukemic stem cells are not efﬁciently
eliminated by TKIs, discontinuing TKI therapy often results in
CML recurrence (4). Third, while CML is highly sensitive to
tumor immunity, TKIs may suppress functions of T cells and
dendritic cells (5–7). Therefore, next-generation therapies for
CML are required.
Dendritic cells are the most potent professional antigenpresenting cells and are essential for the initiation and regulation of innate and adaptive immunity against pathogens and
tumors (8). Dendritic cells are a heterogeneous population that
can be divided into classical dendritic cells (cDC; further
divided into CD8aþ dendritic cells, CD4þ dendritic cells, and
double-negative dendritic cells in mice) and plasmacytoid
dendritic cells (pDC) both in humans and mice (9). CD8aþ

IRF8 Overrides BCR-ABL in Dendritic Cell Development

dendritic cells (BDCA3þ in humans) are a unique subset
capable of priming CTLs by cross-presentation of dead cell
materials and are thus critical for tumor immunity. pDCs
produce a large amount of type I IFN, that is, IFN-a/b, upon
Toll-like receptor (TLR)-7/8/9 signaling. Type I IFN elicits
antiviral and antitumor responses. Of note, IFN-a was once
used as a major therapeutic agent for CML (10, 11).
CML has long been suggested to be highly sensitive to T cell–
mediated tumor immunity (12). CML responds to immunemediated therapies, such as IFN-a, allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT), and donor lymphocyte infusion (13). IFN-a
induces a speciﬁc T-cell response in CML (10, 11). In alloSCT, Tcell depletion from donor bone marrow cells results in a
signiﬁcant increase in relapse, especially in patients with CML.
Yet, the fact that the disease develops in patients with CML
suggests that tumor immunity is insufﬁcient in patients with
CML. Because T cells per se in patients with CML rarely express
BCR-ABL, it is reasonable to suspect dendritic cells as a culprit.
Indeed, several studies have shown that patients with CML have
reduced numbers of cDCs and pDCs in the chronic phase, as
compared with healthy individuals (14, 15). Other studies have
reported that dendritic cells generated in vitro from monocytes
or CD34þ cells of patients with CML are functionally defective in
multiple aspects, such as actin organization, antigen processing,
migration, maturation, and cytokine production (16, 17). In a
murine CML model, defective homing and impaired induction
of CTLs by BCR-ABL–expressing dendritic cells have been
reported (18). However, the mechanism of impaired dendritic
cell development in CML remains unknown.
IFN regulatory factor-8 (IRF8) is a hematopoietic transcription factor that regulates the development of multiple immune
cell types (19). IRF8 is required for differentiation of mouse
cDCs (particularly CD8aþ dendritic cells; refs. 20, 21), pDCs
(22), and monocytes (particularly Ly6Cþ monocytes; ref. 23),
while inhibiting myeloid cell proliferation and neutrophil
differentiation (24). IRF8 is also indispensable for the differentiation of CTLs (25). Thus, Irf8/ mice develop immunodeﬁciency and a CML-like syndrome (26). Importantly, mutations in the human IRF8 gene are associated with dendritic cell
immunodeﬁciency (27). Furthermore, IRF8 expression is dramatically decreased in patients with CML (28, 29). IRF8 also
overcomes the mitogenic activity of BCR-ABL in differentiating
myeloid progenitors in vitro (30). Coexpression of IRF8 in bone
marrow progenitors can ameliorate BCR-ABL–induced myeloproliferative disorder in mice (31). Coexpression of IRF8 in a
BCR-ABL–transformed mouse pro-B cell line induces a chemokine-dependent antileukemia immunity in mice (31–33).
These ﬁndings imply that there is an antagonistic relationship
between IRF8 and CML pathogenesis. However, this idea has
not been tested in terms of dendritic cell biology yet. In this
study, we have investigated how BCR-ABL and IRF8 are
involved in the development and function of dendritic cells
in CML using a murine model.

Materials and Methods
Mice
C57BL/6-Ly5.1 or -Ly5.2 congenic mice and OT-I or OT-II T
cell receptor transgenic mice (The Jackson Laboratory) were

used at 8 to 12 weeks of age. All animal experiments were
carried out in accordance with the Guidelines for Proper
Conduct of Animal Experiments (Science Council of Japan),
and all protocols were approved by the Institutional Review
Boards of Yokohama City University (Yokohama, Japan; Protocol #F11-85).
Flow cytometry
Flow cytometry was performed using FACSCanto II (BD
Biosciences), and data were analyzed using the FlowJo software (TreeStar). For antibodies and their clone names, see
Supplementary Materials and Methods.
Separation of hematopoietic progenitors
Murine lineage marker–negative (Lin) cells were puriﬁed
from bone marrow cells by the magnetic-activated cell sorting
(MACS) system using the Lineage Cell Depletion Kit (Miltenyi
Biotec) and anti-interleukin (IL)-7 receptor (IL-7R/CD127)
antibody. For isolation of LinSca-1þc-Kitþ (LSK) cells,
MACS-puriﬁed Lin cells were stained with antibodies against
Sca-1 and c-Kit, and were then puriﬁed by the ﬂuorescenceactivated cell sorting (FACS) system using a FACSAria II (BD
Biosciences).
Retroviral transduction and CML model mice
The following murine stem cell virus (MSCV) retroviral
vectors were used: MIG [MSCV-internal ribosome entry site
(IRES)- GFP], MIG-p210BCR-ABL (MSCV-p210BCR-ABL-IRESGFP), MICD8 [MSCV-IRES-human truncated CD8 (hCD8t)],
and MICD8-IRF8 (MSCV-IRF8-IRES-hCD8t). Lin cells were
precultured for 24 hours with stem cell factor (SCF) and
thrombopoietin (TPO) for transplantation, or SCF, IL-6, and
IL-3 for in vitro experiments, and were then transduced with
MSCVs by spinoculation for 2 consecutive days. All cytokines
were purchased from PeproTech. For generating CML model
mice, C57BL/6-Ly5.1 LSK cells transduced with MIG or MIGp210BCR-ABL were injected intravenously into lethally irradiated
syngenic C57BL/6-Ly5.2 recipients.
qRT-PCR, ELISA, and immunoblot analysis
Quantitative PCR (qPCR) with quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed using RNAiso Plus
(Takara Bio), DNase I (Invitrogen), PrimeScript (Takara Bio),
Thunderbird SYBR qPCR Mix (Toyobo), and an ABI PRISM
7900 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturers' protocols. Primer sequences are
described in Supplementary Materials and Methods. Data were
analyzed using the DDCT method and normalized against
Gapdh levels. ELISA for IFN-a and IL-12p40 was performed
using commercially available kits (PBL and BioLegend, respectively). For immunoblot analysis, anti-IRF8 (C-19; Santa Cruz
Biotechnology), c-ABL (Cell Signaling Technology), phosphotyrosine (4G10; Millipore), and b-actin (AC-74; Sigma-Aldrich)
antibodies were used.
Dendritic cell culture
Bone marrow Lin cells transduced with MSCVs were washed
24 hours after the last spinoculation and cultured with human

fms-like tyrosine kinase-3 (Flt3)-ligand (Flt3L) for 7 days to
induce dendritic cell differentiation. TKIs and a STAT5 inhibitor [N0 -((4-oxo-4H-chromen-3-yl)methylene)nicotinohydrazide]
were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Trichostatin A
(TSA) and 5-azacytidine (5-Aza) were purchased from Focus
Biomolecules and Sigma-Aldrich, respectively.
Microarray
RNAs from two independent experiments were analyzed
using a Whole Mouse Genome 8  60 K Microarray (Agilent)
according to the manufacturer's protocol. Microarray data are
available at the GEO/NCBI database (GSE44920). For details,
see Supplementary Materials and Methods.
T-cell response assays
Antigen presentation capability of dendritic cells via MHC
class II (MHC-II) was evaluated using OT-II T cells essentially
as previously described (21). In vitro CTL assays were performed using OT-I T cells essentially by the method previously
established (34).

Results
BCR-ABL inhibits dendritic cell development and Irf8
expression
To investigate how dendritic cell development is affected
in CML, we ﬁrst used a murine CML model in which
hematopoietic progenitors (LSK cells) were transduced with
bicistronic MIG-p210BCR-ABL retrovirus (carrying cDNAs
encoding BCR-ABL and GFP) in the presence of SCF and
TPO, and then transplanted these cells into lethally irradiated
mice. These mice (BCR-ABL mice), but not mice transplanted
with empty MIG-transduced cells (MIG mice), exhibited
splenomegaly and died by 4 to 8 weeks after the transplantation (Fig. 1A and Supplementary Fig. S1A). Wright–Giemsa
staining and ﬂow-cytometric analyses of splenic cells
revealed that BCR-ABL mice had signiﬁcant increases in the
percentage and number of GFPþ (therefore BCR-ABLþ)
neutrophils, a hallmark of CML, as compared with MIG mice
(Fig. 1B and C).
We found that both cDCs (CD11chigh cells) and pDCs
(CD11clowPDCA-1þ cells) were dramatically diminished in
BCR-ABL mice as compared with MIG mice; the percentage
and number of GFPþ cDCs showed 16.7- and 6.5-fold reductions, respectively, and those of pDCs showed 18.1- and 8.1-fold
reductions, respectively (Fig. 1D). More detailed analysis demonstrated that all cDC subsets, that is, CD8aþ dendritic cells,
CD4þ dendritic cells, and CD8aCD4 (double-negative) dendritic cells, were signiﬁcantly diminished (Supplementary Fig.
S1B). In addition, we noted that the remaining GFPþ cDCs in
BCR-ABL mice expressed lower levels of MHC-II compared
with those in MIG mice (Supplementary Fig. S1C). In fact, these
spared dendritic cells exhibited a reduced capability of presenting ovalbumin (OVA) antigen, as demonstrated by the
proliferation of and IFN-g production by OT-II T cells (Supplementary Fig. S1D). These results indicate that BCR-ABL
strongly and globally inhibits the generation of dendritic cells
in vivo.

BCR-ABL inhibits an early stage of dendritic cell
differentiation
We next analyzed progenitor populations in the bone marrow.
Dendritic cells originate from bone marrow hematopoietic stem
cells through monocyte-dendritic cell progenitors (MDP; Lin
Sca-1CD127c-Kitint/þCD115þ) and then common dendritic
cell progenitors (CDP; LinSca-1CD127Flt3þc-KitintCD115þ;
refs. 9, 35). MDPs are a CD115þ population in myeloid progenitors (LinCD127Sca-1c-Kitþ), and overlap with granulocytemonocyte progenitors (GMP; LinCD127Sca-1c-KitþCD16/
32þCD34þ) and to a lesser extent common myeloid progenitors
(CMP; LinCD127Sca-1c-KitþCD16/32lowCD34þ). Within
myeloid progenitors, CMPs progress toward either GMPs or
megakaryocyte-erythroid progenitors (MEP; LinCD127Sca1c-KitþCD16/32CD34).
Interestingly, the bone marrow GFPþ population in BCR-ABL
mice lacked MDPs and CDPs (Fig. 1E). The percentages of total
GFPþ myeloid progenitors were comparable between BCR-ABL
mice and MIG mice (Supplementary Fig. S1E). GFPþ myeloid
progenitors in BCR-ABL mice had relatively low percentages of
CMPs and GMPs, which could be partially due to the lack of
MDPs, while they contained a modestly increased percentage of
MEPs and harbored an aberrant CD34 CD16/32þ population.
Despite the sharp decrease in MDP counts, we noted that
monocyte counts were not signiﬁcantly affected in BCR-ABL
mice (data not shown), consistent with the fact that monocyte
counts are not reduced in patients with CML. The developmental route of these BCR-ABLþ monocytes is unknown, but one
possibility is that they are derived from upstream myeloid
progenitors without transiting MDPs. Overall, these data suggest
that BCR-ABL affects the early stage of dendritic cell differentiation, particularly the generation of MDPs.
We analyzed IRF8 expression in BCR-ABL and MIG mice.
qRT-PCR analysis revealed that BCR-ABL suppressed Irf8
mRNA expression both in Lin bone marrow progenitors and
splenic cells (Fig. 1F). Immunostaining for IRF8 in splenic
dendritic cells demonstrated that the remaining few BCRABLþ dendritic cells expressed lower levels of IRF8 than
control dendritic cells (Fig. 1G and Supplementary Fig. S1F).
IRF8 overrides BCR-ABL to rescue dendritic cell
differentiation
To further investigate the mechanisms involved in this
process, we examined whether BCR-ABL inhibits dendritic
cell differentiation in vitro. We transduced MIG-p210BCR-ABL
or empty MIG retrovirus into bone marrow Lin progenitors in
the presence of SCF, IL-6, and IL-3, and the transduced cells
were then cultured with Flt3L for 7 days to induce differentiation toward cDCs (CD11chighMHC-IIþ) and pDCs
(CD11cþB220þCD11blow; ref. 21). In MIG-transduced control
cultures, cDCs and pDCs were efﬁciently generated (Fig. 2A).
In BCR-ABL–transduced cultures, however, the development
of both cDCs and pDCs was signiﬁcantly inhibited in terms of
percentages and absolute cell counts, even though BCR-ABL–
transduced cells showed a greater increase in cell number
during the Flt3L culture than MIG-transduced cells. Wright–
Giemsa staining revealed that while many of the MIGtransduced cells showed typical dendritic cell morphology,

BCR-ABL–transduced cells exhibited neutrophil-like, macrophage-like, or immature morphologies (Fig. 2B). Furthermore,
the induction of Irf8 mRNA expression during the Flt3L culture
was almost completely abrogated by BCR-ABL (Fig. 2C). When
a kinase-dead K1172R mutant of BCR-ABL was transduced into
cells, neither dendritic cell development nor IRF8 expression
was affected, suggesting that the kinase activity of BCR-ABL is
required for the observed inhibitory effects (Fig. 2D). The
expression levels of wild-type (WT) and K1172R BCR-ABL
were comparable, and K1172R lacked autophosphorylation at
tyrosine residues.

IRF8 Overrides BCR-ABL in Dendritic Cell Development

We next asked whether restoration of IRF8 expression
could improve dendritic cell differentiation impaired by
BCR-ABL. To this end, we cotransduced Lin cells with
MICD8-IRF8 (that expresses IRF8 and hCD8t) together with
MIG-p210BCR-ABL, and treated them with Flt3L. hCD8t, used
as a transduction marker, does not transmit any signals
because it contains no cytoplasmic domain. Flow-cytometric
analysis of doubly transduced (i.e., GFPþhCD8tþ) cells
revealed that the forced expression of IRF8 efﬁciently rescued differentiation of both cDCs and pDCs (Fig. 3A). The
expression levels of Irf8 mRNA and IRF8 protein in

IRF8-transduced BCR-ABLþ cells were comparable with
those of endogenous IRF8 in control cells (Fig. 3B and C,
compare the ﬁrst and fourth lanes). Importantly, IRF8 also
efﬁciently overrode the TKI-resistant T315I-mutant BCRABL to rescue dendritic cell differentiation (Fig. 3D). WT
and T315I BCR-ABL were expressed at comparable levels
(Fig. 3B and C). These results indicate that the suppression
of Irf8 is a cause, rather than a result, of dendritic cell
deﬁciency by BCR-ABL in CML.
IRF8 normalizes the expression of a signiﬁcant portion
of BCR-ABL–dysregulated genes

in bone marrow Lin cells transduced with empty vectors,
MIG-p210BCR-ABL, or MIG-p210BCR-ABL þ MICD8-IRF8 followed by 5-day Flt3L culture (see Supplementary Fig. S2A

and S2B for quality control data). We ﬁrst calculated the
number of genes whose expression was signiﬁcantly affected
by BCR-ABL [fold change (FC) > 3; false discovery rate (FDR)
< 0.05] and those normalized by IRF8 (Fig. 4A and Supplementary Tables S1 and S2). The criteria of normalization
were as follows: IRF8 signiﬁcantly reverses the expression in
BCR-ABLþ cells (FC > 2; FDR < 0.05), and expression of the
gene becomes comparable between control dendritic cells
and IRF8-rescued BCR-ABLþ dendritic cells (i.e., FC is no
longer > 3 and FDR < 0.05). BCR-ABL decreased the expression of 1,433 genes and increased the expression of 1,915
genes (FC > 3). Among these genes, despite the stringent
criteria, IRF8 normalized the expression of 688 genes (48%)
and 564 genes (29%), respectively. These results indicate that
BCR-ABL impairs the expression of many genes via suppressing IRF8 expression.

Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA; ref. 36) showed that
expression of dendritic cell signature genes (37) was indeed
signiﬁcantly suppressed by BCR-ABL, and was efﬁciently reinduced by coexpression of IRF8 (Fig. 4B). qRT-PCR analysis of
several of these genes (Ciita, H2-Eb2, and H2-Aa) in the same set
of transduced cells as well as cells transduced with IRF8 alone
on day 7 and in freshly isolated Lin cells conﬁrmed the
ﬁndings (Fig. 4C, top). Expression of other genes critical for
the function of CD8aþ dendritic cells (e.g., cross-presentation),
such as Clec9a, Xcr1, and Tlr3, was also suppressed by BCR-ABL
and restored by IRF8 (Fig. 4C, bottom). Conversely, GSEA
showed that expression of granulocyte signature genes (see

We also paid attention to the genes dysregulated by BCRABL but not normalized by IRF8. We used Ingenuity Pathway
Analysis (IPA) software to predict transcription factors that
may act upstream of these genes. The results showed that
the genes induced by BCR-ABL, irrespective of IRF8 supplementation, were signiﬁcantly enriched with those inducible
by NF-kB, a transcription factor activated by BCR-ABL and

to speculate that IRF8-rescued, BCR-ABL–expressing dendritic cells may be in a "preactivated" state. Other predicted
transcription factors included GATA1 and STAT5 (see Discussion). Indeed, the expression of Gata1 itself was 15-fold
higher in BCR-ABL–transduced cells than in control dendritic cells, regardless of IRF8 supplementation.

IRF8-rescued BCR-ABLþ dendritic cells have higher
cytokine production and CTL induction capacities
We next evaluated the functionality of the rescued dendritic
cells. To examine their ability to produce IFN-a and IL-12p40,
transduced Lin cells followed by 7-day Flt3L culture were
stimulated with TLR9 ligands CpG-A (for pDCs) or CpG-B (for
cDCs), or a TLR4 ligand lipopolysaccharide (LPS; Fig. 5A). TLRs
recognize not only the pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMP) but also damage-associated molecular patterns
(DAMP) that may be involved in antitumor immunity (39).
BCR-ABL almost completely abolished production of these
cytokines, but their expression was restored by coexpression of
IRF8. Interestingly, IRF8-rescued BCR-ABLþ dendritic cells
produced even higher levels of these cytokines than control
dendritic cells, especially for IL-12p40, whose expression is
dependent on NF-kB and IRF8 (19, 40).
We also examined the expression of MHC-related molecules
by ﬂow cytometry. BCR-ABL strongly inhibited MHC-II expression, but increased MHC-I expression 4.1-fold (Fig. 5B and
Supplementary Fig. S3). When IRF8 expression was supplemented, MHC-II expression was recovered, and MHC-I expression remained high. We also found that expression of the
costimulatory molecules CD80 and CD86 was signiﬁcantly
induced by BCR-ABL and remained high in IRF8-cotransduced
cells. We noted that the mRNA levels of MHC-I, CD80, and
CD86 did not correlate with protein expression levels on the

cell surface, suggesting the occurrence of posttranscriptional
control. The expression level of another costimulatory molecule CD40 was low and not affected by BCR-ABL. Thus, IRF8rescued BCR-ABLþ dendritic cells expressed higher levels of
MHC-I and some costimulatory molecules than regular dendritic cells.
CD8aþ dendritic cells have been shown to be critical for
eliminating tumor cells by priming CTLs via cross-presentation in mice (41). In addition, CD8aþ dendritic cells require
type I IFN to induce CTLs that reject tumors (42, 43). These
previous ﬁndings, together with the above data on cytokine
production and MHC-related molecules, prompted us to examine the ability to cross-present an antigen (OVA) to induce a
CTL response (Fig. 5C). Transduced Lin cells followed by 7day Flt3L culture were pulsed with OVA protein, and then
mixed with T cells from OT-I mice. The primed T cells were
then mixed with target splenocytes loaded with OVA peptide,
and OVA-speciﬁc CTL activity was calculated. Although control dendritic cells efﬁciently induced CTLs, BCR-ABL–transduced cells failed to do so. Strikingly, IRF8-rescued BCR-ABLþ
dendritic cells regained the ability to induce CTLs, and the
observed response was even stronger than that of control
dendritic cells.
Transduction of IRF8 without BCR-ABL did not augment the
above functional parameters. Thus, these results suggest that
BCR-ABL harbors an immune-stimulatory potential that is

manifested when dendritic cell differentiation is restored by
supplementation with IRF8.
Imatinib partially restores Irf8 expression, but cancels
the enhancement of functionality in IRF8-rescued
BCR-ABLþ dendritic cells
To investigate whether clinically available TKIs can restore
Irf8 expression as well as dendritic cell differentiation and
function, imatinib, nilotinib, and dasatinib were added at
concentrations two times higher than those required for
90% inhibition (IC90) of BCR-ABL kinase activity during the
Flt3L treatment of transduced Lin cells. These TKIs partially
restored the expression of Irf8 expression in BCR-ABL–transduced cells (Fig. 6A, top). Efﬁcient inhibition of BCR-ABL
kinase activity by imatinib was conﬁrmed by immunoblot
analysis for autophosphorylation of BCR-ABL (Fig. 6A, bottom). Presumably, due to the modest but signiﬁcant increase in
Irf8 expression, imatinib restored cDC differentiation (Fig. 6B).
However, the recovery of pDC differentiation and MHC-II
expression was not complete (Fig. 6B and C). In addition, the
recovery of cytokine production and CTL induction was very
modest (Fig. 6D). Interestingly, imatinib canceled the enhancement of dendritic cell functionality by BCR-ABL in IRF8rescued BCR-ABLþ dendritic cells; MHC-I, CD80, and CD86
expression, cytokine production, and CTL induction all
returned to unenhanced levels. Thus, BCR-ABL augments
dendritic cell functionality via its tyrosine kinase activity. We
also noted that in control dendritic cells, TKIs modestly
inhibited Irf8 expression, and that imatinib slightly suppressed
the ability of control dendritic cells to of induce CTLs (Fig. 6E).
Overall, these data suggest that dendritic cells rescued by IRF8
are more functional than those rescued by TKIs, at least under
the condition used in this study.
To elucidate the pathway through which BCR-ABL inhibits
Irf8 expression, we tested whether a STAT5 inhibitor, a histone
deacetylase inhibitor (TSA), or a DNA methytransferase inhibitor (5-Aza) improved Irf8 expression and dendritic cell differentiation. TSA and 5-Aza were tested because we speculated
that epigenetic mechanisms may be involved, given the discrepancy between the effects of the kinase-dead BCR-ABL–
mutant and of imatinib treatment after BCR-ABL expression
on Irf8 expression. However, none of these agents restored Irf8
expression or dendritic cell differentiation in BCR-ABL–transduced cells, and instead tended to suppress these events in
control cells (Supplementary Fig. S4). Combinations of TSA or
5-Aza with imatinib also failed to rescue Irf8 expression and
dendritic cell differentiation.

Discussion
In this study, the antagonistic relationship between BCRABL and IRF8 was investigated in the context of dendritic cell
development in CML. Our results revealed that BCR-ABL
abolishes dendritic cell development at the level of generating
MDPs. This causes severe reductions in dendritic cell counts
for all subsets in CML mice, consistent with previous ﬁndings
in patients with CML (14, 15). BCR-ABL inhibits Irf8 expression,
and supplementation with IRF8 restores the expression of a

6650

Cancer Res; 73(22) November 15, 2013

signiﬁcant portion of BCR-ABL–dysregulated genes, leading to
efﬁcient recovery of dendritic cell differentiation. Thus, the
suppression of Irf8 expression is the cause of impaired dendritic cell development by BCR-ABL, which we infer accounts,
at least in part, for the inability of patients with CML to
establish antileukemic immunity.
Gene expression proﬁling indicated that the expression of a
signiﬁcant numbers of NF-kB target genes was increased by
BCR-ABL, and predicted that IRF8-rescued BCR-ABLþ dendritic cells may be in a preactivated state. In fact, we found that
the rescued dendritic cells had higher cytokine production and
CTL induction capacity than normal dendritic cells, and such
enhancement was completely canceled by imatinib. These
results indicate that BCR-ABL harbors an immune-stimulatory
potential, which would not be elicited in the natural course of
CML or during the therapy with TKIs. Thus, IRF8 seems to
"convert" BCR-ABL from a dendritic cell suppressor to a
dendritic cell activator.
We have previously shown that IRF8 overrides the mitogenic
activity of BCR-ABL in differentiating myeloid progenitor cells
(30). It has also been shown that IRF8 antagonizes the antiapoptotic effect of BCR-ABL (44). Moreover, coexpression of
IRF8 inhibits BCR-ABL–induced myeloid hyperplasia in vivo
(31). Neutrophil differentiation is promoted by BCR-ABL (45),
but potently inhibited by IRF8 (24). Therefore, we expect the
restoration of IRF8 to have two distinct effects. One is to
directly reduce tumor burden by inhibiting abnormally
enhanced growth and survival of myeloid cells as well as
disproportionate neutrophil differentiation. The other is to
induce effective anti-CML immunity by restoring dendritic cell
development and by cooperating with BCR-ABL to strengthen
dendritic cell functionality. In this regard, IRF8 may be the key
to establishing multidisciplinary therapy for CML.
We propose that the selective restoration of IRF8 will serve
as a hallmark for new CML therapies that may overcome the
problems with current TKI therapy. First, the effects of IRF8
supplementation are not affected by TKI-resistant mutations
in BCR-ABL. Second, unlike TKIs, IRF8 therapy would generate
BCR-ABLþ dendritic cells with enhanced functionality to
induce anti-CML CTL responses. Finally, once anti-CML CTLs
are induced, it would be possible to discontinue the IRF8
therapy. It should be noted, however, that the possibility of
autoimmune reactions by these hyperfunctional dendritic cells
will need to be evaluated.
To develop a method for restoration of IRF8 expression, it
will be essential to understand the mechanism through which
BCR-ABL inhibits IRF8 expression and dendritic cell development. Our data seem to provide some insights into these
mechanisms. Unlike Irf8/ mice, which show severe reduction in CDP counts but not in MDP counts (23, 46), CML model
mice lack both MDPs and CDPs. Thus, the dendritic cell
differentiation stage affected by BCR-ABL is upstream of that
affected by the loss of IRF8. This suggests that BCR-ABL acts on
machinery that is required for the expression of Irf8 (the
mechanism of which has not been clariﬁed yet) as well as the
generation of MDPs.
One possibility raised from the above context is inhibition of
the transcription factor PU.1 by GATA1. PU.1 is expressed in

similar sets of hematopoietic cell lineages as IRF8 and is
required for the generation of MDPs (35). PU.1 activity is
inhibited by GATA1, which is essential for the generation of
MEPs (47). Our data showed that BCR-ABL strongly induced
Gata1 expression. Moreover, GATA1 targets were indeed signiﬁcantly enriched in genes induced by BCR-ABL and that the
percentage of MEPs was increased in BCR-ABL mice. Interestingly, GATA1 has been shown to inhibit Irf8 expression,
possibly by preventing PU.1 recruitment to the Irf8 promoter in
dendritic cells (48). Moreover, GATA1 activity can be augmented via PI3K /AKT, a signaling pathway stimulated by BCR-ABL
(49). Therefore, inhibition of PU.1 through induction and
activation of GATA1 by BCR-ABL is an attractive possibility.
Other possibilities included the involvement of STAT5. It has
been reported that GM-CSF inhibits Irf8 expression via STAT5
(50). Thus, it was tempting to speculate that BCR-ABL–activated STAT5 suppresses IRF8 expression. However, our experiments using the STAT5 inhibitor did not support this. Finally,
even though we observed that TSA or 5-Aza, as single agents or
in combination with imatinib, failed to rescue Irf8 expression, it
is still important to consider the possibility that other histone
modiﬁcations, such as methylation, may be involved.
In conclusion, our present study provides new insights into
CML pathogenesis and the basis of new therapy for CML in
terms of dendritic cell biology. Further investigation of the
mechanisms through which BCR-ABL suppresses IRF8 expression will be required to develop a method to selectively restore
IRF8 expression.
