Abstract
The EGFR-targeted antibody cetuximab is effective against head
and neck cancer (HNSCC), but in only 15% to 20% of patients,
and the variability and extent of cetuximab-mediated cellular
immunity is not fully understood. We hypothesized that regulatory T cells (Treg) may exert a functional and clinical impact on
antitumor immunity in cetuximab-treated individuals. The frequency, immunosuppressive phenotype, and activation status of
Treg and natural killer (NK) cells were analyzed in the circulation
and tumor microenvironment of cetuximab-treated patients with
HNSCC enrolled in a novel neoadjuvant, single-agent cetuximab
clinical trial. Notably, cetuximab treatment increased the frequency of CD4þFOXP3þ intratumoral Treg expressing CTLA-4, CD39,
and TGFb. These Treg suppressed cetuximab-mediated antibody-

dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and their presence correlated with poor clinical outcome in two prospective clinical trial
cohorts. Cetuximab expanded CTLA-4þFOXP3þ Treg in vitro, in
part, by inducing dendritic cell maturation, in combination with
TGFb and T-cell receptor triggering. Importantly, cetuximab-activated NK cells selectively eliminated intratumoral Treg but preserved effector T cells. In ex vivo assays, ipilimumab targeted CTLA4þ Treg and restored cytolytic functions of NK cells mediating
ADCC. Taken together, our results argue that differences in Tregmediated suppression contribute to the clinical response to cetuximab treatment, suggesting its improvement by adding ipilimumab or other strategies of Treg ablation to promote antitumor
immunity. Cancer Res; 75(11); 2200–10. 2015 AACR.

Introduction

cetuximab mediates antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity
(ADCC) of NK cells (9), which can be augmented by cytokines
(10–12). Furthermore, cetuximab can facilitate cross-talk between
NK cells and dendritic cells (DC), which induces EGFR-speciﬁc
cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL; refs. 10, 12) and/or activation of
the complement system (13). Despite the various potential
mechanisms of cetuximab activity, little is known about the effects
of anti-EGFR mAb therapy on the cellular immune system in the
tumor microenvironment (TME; ref. 2). In addition, the cellular
and molecular escape mechanisms negatively regulating ADCC or
EGFR-speciﬁc CTL activity (12, 14) have yet to be delineated.
The frequency of regulatory T cells (Treg) is increased at tumor
sites and among the peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) of
patients with cancer (15–17), including those with HNSCC
(18). The enrichment of Treg in tumor-inﬁltrating lymphocytes
(TIL) may promote cancer cell growth and the metastatic potential
by suppressing antitumor immunity. Treg could also suppress NK
cell responses through expression of suppressive cytokines and
other tumor growth–promoting effects (19). It is known that Treg
can inhibit NKG2D expression, impairing NK cell cytotoxicity and
DC maturation (20, 21). However, whether Treg inhibit cetuximab-induced, NK cell–mediated ADCC or antitumor T cells in
treated patients with cancer is unknown, and the mechanism(s)
and clinical implications of such Treg-mediated suppressive
effects remain to be elucidated.
In this study, we investigated the effects of cetuximab therapy
on the frequency of Treg in the peripheral circulation and in the
TME of patients with HNSCC, using freshly isolated TIL from a

EGF receptor (EGFR)-speciﬁc therapy is moderately effective in
the treatment of head and neck squamous cell cancer (HNSCC;
refs. 1, 2). EGFR-speciﬁc monoclonal antibodies (Ab) such as
cetuximab enhance survival of patients with HNSCC, whereas
EGFR-speciﬁc tyrosine kinase inhibitors do not (3, 4). However,
the response rate for cetuximab therapy in patients with HNSCC is
low (15%20%). It has been proposed that cetuximab resistance
is related to the activity of downstream EGFR-independent pathways (5), decreased EGFR internalization (6), genetic alterations
of EGFR (7), or genotype of Fcg receptor IIIa (CD16) on NK cells
(8). This latter mechanism is based on accumulating evidence that

Treg Induced by Cetuximab Inﬂuence Clinical Outcome

prospective clinical trial of single-agent, cetuximab-treated
patients. We found that Treg suppress NK cell–mediated ADCC
in a TGFb1-dependent manner. The frequency of Treg was inversely associated with NK cell activation at the tumor sites and with the
clinical course of the disease in cetuximab-treated patients. Interestingly, NK cells selectively eliminated intratumoral FOXP3þ
Treg in the presence of ipilimumab ex vivo and thus decreased
the Treg suppression of NK cells mediating cetuximab-driven
ADCC. These results indicate that depletion of Treg by targeting
CTLA-4 promotes antitumor immunity in the TME and enhances
the efﬁcacy of cetuximab therapy.

Patients and Methods
Patients and specimens
All patients were seen in the Outpatient Clinic of the Department of Otolaryngology at the University of Pittsburgh Medical
Center (Pittsburgh, PA), and all subjects signed an informed
consent approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of Pittsburgh (IRB #99-06). Peripheral venous blood samples were obtained from cetuximab-treated patients with previously untreated stage III/IV HNSCC, including 22 patients treated
with cetuximab plus cisplatin/paclitaxel/radiotherapy followed by
6 months of maintenance single-agent cetuximab (UPCI-05-003,
NCT 00226239; ref. 1) and 18 patients receiving single-agent
cetuximab on a separate prospective phase II clinical trial (UPCI
#08-013, NCT 01218048; refs. 12, 22), as described in Table 1. All
analyses were conducted on protocol patients who were receiving
single-agent cetuximab. Blood samples were obtained 1 to 7 days
before cetuximab therapy and again after the conclusion of therapy
(1 month). The comparison (cetuximab-na€ve) HNSCC cohorts
were gender and age-matched, previously cetuximab-untreated
patients with HNSCC. No patients were excluded as a result of
prior treatments or performance status. Blood from cetuximabna€ve patients with HNSCC was drawn within the same period
after completing therapy without cetuximab.
Collection and processing of PBMC and TIL
Blood samples from patients with cancer and healthy donors
(40 mL) were drawn into heparinized tubes and centrifuged on
Ficoll-Hypaque gradients (GE Healthcare Bioscience). PBL were
recovered, washed in RPMI-1640 or AIM-V medium (Invitrogen),
and immediately used for experiments. For TIL isolation, tumor

tissues obtained from patients with HNSCC undergoing surgery
were collected, placed in sterile medium, and delivered to the
laboratory for processing. Tumor tissues were sliced into small
pieces, which then were transferred to a cell strainer (70-mm
nylon) and mechanically minced using a syringe plunger. No
enzymes were used for TIL recovery. The cells that passed through
the cell strainer were collected and subjected to Ficoll-Hypaque
gradient centrifugation. Mononuclear cells were recovered and
used for ADCC assays or were stored at 80 C for l FACS analysis.
For pre- and post-cetuximab treatment, peripheral bold mononuclear cells (PBMC) and TIL were isolated from patients with
HNSCC before and after therapy, according to the protocol for the
UPCI #08-013 trial.
Cell isolation
CD4þCD25þ T cells and CD3CD56þ NK cells were isolated
from freshly obtained PBMC by immunomagnetic sorting
(Miltenyi) or by using a human NK cell Enrichment Kit (STEM
Cell Technology), respectively, following the manufacturers'
instructions. Cell separation was performed using an AutoMACS (for Treg isolation) and EasySep magnet (for NK cell
isolation) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Flow-bases
cell sorting was used to isolate NK cells from TIL. Viability of
separated cells was measured using trypan blue dye.
Monoclonal antibodies and ﬂow cytometry
The mAb used to stain human cells included CD39-FITC/PC7,
FOXP3-FITC, FOXP3 PerCP-Cy5.5 (clone PCH101, eBioscience);
LAP-PE, PD-1-APC (eBioscience); CD14-ECD, CD4-PC5 (all Beckman Coulter); CD73-PE, CTLA-4-PE, TIM-3-Brillian violet 421,
CD107a-PE, CD137-Percp cy5.5, CD25-PE-Cy7, Granzyme BFITC, Perforin-APC, CD39-APC, CD16-PE-Cy7 (Biolegend);
CD25-PE (Miltenyi), LAG-3-ATTO647N conjugate (Enzo Life
Sciences); CD56-PE-Texas Red, CD3-Alexa Fluor 405 conjugate
(Invitrogen); and CD4-AF700 (BD Biosciences) and their respective isotype controls. All mAb preparations were pretitrated using
activated as well as nonactivated PBMC to determine the optimal
staining dilution for each. Intracellular staining for Foxp3, granzyme B, and perforin was performed as follows: PBMC or TIL were
stained with mAb for surface markers and subsequently ﬁxed and
permeabilized (eBioscience). After washing, cells were subjected to
intracellular staining for Foxp3, granzyme B, and perforin. Flow
cytometry was performed using an EPICS XL-MCL ﬂow cytometer
equipped with Expo32 software, a CyAn ﬂow cytometer (Dako) or
Fortesa (Becton Dickinson) machine; data were analyzed using
Summit V4.3 software or the FlowJo software (TreeStar, Inc.). The
acquisition and analysis gates were restricted to the lymphocyte
gate based on characteristic properties of the cells in the forward
and side scatter. At least 1  105 events were acquired for analysis
and, where applicable, gates were restricted to CD3þCD4þ for Treg
analysis. Ipilimumab was obtained from Bristol Myers Squibb.
Transwell culture
A head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cell line
(JHU029) and NK cells (1:1 ratio, 0.2  106 cells/well for each cell
type) were cocultured in the presence of cetuximab (10 mg/mL) or
human IgG1 in a the upper chamber of a Transwell plate (0.4-mm
polyester membrane, 6.5 mm insert, 24-well plate; Costar). In the
lower chamber, puriﬁed monocytes and CD4þ T cells [1:2 ratio, 0.2

(CFSE)] were incubated in the presence or absence of TGFb1 (2.5
ng/mL) and/or anti-CD3 antibody (5 mg/mL). These conditions
were previously established by us as optimal for Treg generation
(18). Four days later, CD4þ T cells in the lower chamber were
harvested for analysis of expansion of CTLA-4þFoxp3þ Treg, and
their proliferation was assessed by CFSE dilution using ﬂow
cytometry. Four days after incubation, the frequency of CTLA4þFoxp3þ Treg was assessed by ﬂow cytometry using the PerCPCy5.5 dye. To conﬁrm DC maturation, tumor cells, NK cell, and
cetuximab in the upper chamber were incubated with monocytes
alone in the lower chamber for 48 hours. Monocytes were harvested for analysis of their status by ﬂow cytometry.
ADCC assay
Cetuximab-mediated NK cell cytotoxicity (ADCC) was measured as previously described (22) with the following modiﬁcations. Brieﬂy, K562 or PCI-13 target cells were incubated with 2
mmol/L CFSE (Invitrogen) for 10 minutes at 37 C in the dark.
Staining with CFSE was quenched with RPMI complete medium,
and after 2 washes, the CFSE-labeled target cells were incubated
with PBMC or NK in the absence or presence of Treg at various NK
cell to target ratios ranging from 1:1 to 10:1 for 3 or 18 hours at
37 C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. The ratio of NK cells to Treg was
2:1 in this system. After incubation, 7-aminoactinomycin D (7AAD, Invitrogen; 1 mg/mL) was used to measure cell death, and
cells were acquired on a Beckman Coulter XL or Fortesa (Becton
Dickinson) cytometer. Target cell death was determined by measuring percentage of 7-AADþ cells by gating only on CFSE-positive
target cells. Target cells in the absence of PBMC or NK cells were
used as a negative control, and target cells were incubated for 10
minutes at 56 C as a positive control for cell death. To measure
accurate cytotoxicity on a per cell basis, lytic units (LU) were
deﬁned as the number of NK cells required to kill 20% of 5  104
target cells and then the reciprocal number of this value per 105
NK cells was calculated. The percentage of cytotoxic activity was
calculated using the following formula: % speciﬁc lysis ¼ (7AADþ targets  spontaneous 7-AADþ targets)/(Maximum lysis 
spontaneous 7-AADþ targets)  100.
Statistical analysis
Averages were calculated as means. For nonparametric distribution of samples, P values were calculated by Kruskal–Wallis and
2-tailed exact Wilcoxon–Mann–Whitney tests or nonparametric
paired test (Wilcoxon matched paired test). Disease-speciﬁc survival of patients with HNSCC was deﬁned as the time elapsed
from the ﬁrst treatment with cetuximab until death from HNSCC.
Patients were censored if they were alive at last follow-up or had
died but were cancer-free at the time of death. For prognostic
correlations, we used the Treg frequency of 6%, which was the
mean frequency previously found in untreated patients with
HNSCC (23), and analyzed the prognosis of those patients with
Treg frequencies above or below this level. Treg subclasses were
tested for association with disease-free survival with the log-rank
test. P < 0.05 was considered to be signiﬁcant.

(23), and analyzed the prognosis of those patients with Treg
frequencies above or below this level.
Given that Treg suppress NK-mediated ADCC, we hypothesized
that the Treg frequency might predict clinical response to cetuximab therapy. Indeed, in a cohort of patients with HNSCC (n ¼
22) treated with cetuximab, signiﬁcantly longer survival was
observed in patients with lower Treg frequencies. We have previously established a mean  SD value of 5.3%  3.2% for Treg in
untreated patients with HNSCC and have now used the value of
6% to separate the patients into two groups. Patients with a Treg
frequency lower than 6% fared signiﬁcantly better than those with
the Treg frequency higher than 6% (P ¼ 0.015, Fig. 1B). Those
cetuximab-treated patients with the elevated Treg frequency after
cetuximab therapy appeared to have worse outcome. This result
strongly supports our ﬁnding that the frequency of CD4þ
CD39þCD25hi Treg is a critical factor modulating the efﬁcacy of
cetuximab treatment in patients with HNSCC. Although these

patients received CRT in conjunction with cetuximab, Treg measurements were performed at baseline (untreated) and during
single-agent cetuximab treatment, suggesting that the effect was
cetuximab-speciﬁc, a ﬁnding that was validated in a separate
patient cohort below.

To further document the cetuximab-speciﬁc effects on Treg, a
second cohort of patients (n ¼ 18), who received only single-agent
neoadjuvant cetuximab in a second prospective phase II clinical
trial (UPCI #08-013), was examined. As shown in Fig. 2A, a highly
signiﬁcant and consistent enrichment of CD4þCD25hiFoxp3þ

CD25hiFoxp3þ intratumoral Treg in these patients with HNSCC
as compared with baseline (pre-cetuximab) Treg levels. This result
suggests that cetuximab monotherapy promotes Treg expansion
in the TME, potentially contributing to immunosuppression and
impairing cetuximab-induced immunity (14).
To characterize the immunosuppressive phenotype of Treg
induced during cetuximab therapy, we analyzed expression of
immunosuppressive molecules, including the immune checkpoint receptor, CTLA-4, as well as LAP (membrane-bound TGFb)
and CD39 (an ectonucleotidase), present on the Treg surface.
Effects of cetuximab monotherapy on expression of CTLA-4,
TGFb, and CD39 were assessed on paired PBL and TIL isolated
prospectively from 18 patients with HNSCC treated before and
after 4 weeks of single-agent cetuximab therapy. As shown in Fig.
2, cetuximab monotherapy signiﬁcantly increased the frequency
of CD4þFoxp3þ intratumoral Treg expressing CTLA-4, CD39, and
TGFb (P ¼ 0.002, P ¼ 0.005, and P ¼ 0.0001 respectively; Fig. 2C,
E and H). Interestingly, a signiﬁcant increase was only observed
in circulating Treg expressing CTLA-4 (P ¼ 0.02; Fig. 2C). We also
observed that cetuximab monotherapy signiﬁcantly increased
the frequency of intratumoral CD4þFoxp3þ Treg expressing
TIM-3 (P ¼ 0.0015). However, the frequency of CD4þFoxp3þ
intratumoral Treg expressing PD-1 was not enhanced by cetuximab monotherapy. Although TIM-3þ, PD-1þ, and CD39þ cells
were also increased in Foxp3CD4þ TIL by cetuximab monotherapy, CTLA-4þ/CD39þ cells were signiﬁcantly increased
among the large fraction of CD4þFoxp3þ Treg from patients after
cetuximab treatment, indicating that CTLA-4 and CD39 deﬁne a
distinct subset of CD4þCD25hiFoxp3þ Treg enriched in the TME
of cetuximab-treated patients.
Cetuximab-induced DC maturation contributes to expansion of
CTLA-4þ Treg in combination with T-cell receptor triggering
Several studies showed that in addition to cytokines such as
TGFb, signaling mediated by T-cell receptor (TCR) triggering and
costimulation may be critical events that expand Treg in the TME
(24–26). On the basis of these observations, and the previously
reported capacity of cetuximab to promote DC maturation and
CD8(þ) T-cell priming through "NK-DC cross-talk" (12), we
examined whether cetuximab therapy affects the TCR triggering
and costimulation by analyzing the expression levels of HLA-DR,
CD80, and CD86 on both intratumoral and peripheral blood
HLA-DRþCD11cþ cells from these patients with HNSCC. Indeed,
DC activation/maturation markers were signiﬁcantly upregulated
on intratumoral HLA-DRþCD11cþ cells after cetuximab (not
shown). Given that cetuximab-activated NK cells promote DC
maturation (12) and that TGFB is highly expressed in the TME,
cetuximab therapy may promote the expansion of intratumoral
Treg.
To recapitulate the intratumoral Treg expansion observed in
cetuximab-treated patients, we investigated whether the presence
of cetuximab increased the frequency of CTLA-4þ Treg using a
Transwell plate–based ex vivo system. As shown in Fig. 3A and B,
the frequency of CTLA-4þ Treg was increased in the setting of TCR
stimulation using agonistic, plate-bound anti-CD3 mAb, compared with isotype control control mAb (P < 0.05, P < 0.005, and
P < 0.001, respectively) in the presence or absence of TGFb. This
result was only observed in the presence of cetuximab but not
human IgG1 mAb. Under anti-CD3 stimulatory condition, cetuximab treatment signiﬁcantly increases the frequency of CTLA-4þ
Treg in the presence of TGFb, compared with the absence of it (P <

2204 Cancer Res; 75(11) June 1, 2015

0.001). Taken together, these results indicate that the treatment
with cetuximab can signiﬁcantly increase the frequency of CTLA4þ Treg, which is further expanded in the presence of TCR
triggering.
We also investigated whether incubation with cetuximab
induce proliferation of Foxp3þ Treg in the presence of TGFb1
and/or anti-CD3 antibody by using a CFSE dilution–based assay
and ﬂow cytometry to measure the frequency of CTLA-4þFOXP3þ
Treg. The presence of cetuximab signiﬁcantly enhanced proliferation of Foxp3þ Treg under anti-CD3 Ab stimulatory conditions,
compared with human IgG1 control mAb in the presence and
absence of TGFb (Fig. 3C and D, P < 0.005). Under stimulation
with anti-CD3 Ab, cetuximab treatment signiﬁcantly expanded
Foxp3þ Treg by TGFb, compared with absence of it (P < 0.001).
This result is consistent with our previous report showing that
cetuximab-activated NK cells induce DC maturation (12), which
may provide antigen stimulation and costimulatory signals to
preferentially expand Treg in the TME, where other suppressive
signals exist (i.e., TGFb1).
Cetuximab monotherapy differentially activates both
circulating and intratumoral NK cells in HNSCC patients and
their functional phenotypes are associated with the frequency
of Treg
Previously, we showed that cetuximab-mediated ADCC
activity of NK cells was dependent on CD16 (FcgRIIIa; ref. 8).
However, this in vitro result has not yet been validated real-time
in vivo in cetuximab-treated patients with HNSCC, particularly
in TIL freshly isolated from single-agent cetuximab-treated
patients. To examine whether cetuximab therapy activated NK
cells in these patients, we examined granzyme B and perforin
expression reﬂecting cytotoxic activity, and CD107a, CD137,
and CD16 expression as measures of activation status, in both
circulating and intratumoral NK cells. As shown in Fig. 4A,
although the frequency of NK cells did not change in the PBL or
TIL compartment during the therapy, the frequency of circulating NK cells was signiﬁcantly higher than that of intratumoral NK cells. Similarly, the frequency of CD16þ NK cells also
did not change during the cetuximab therapy on either circulating or intratumoral NK cells, albeit the frequency of circulating NK cells was notably higher than that of intratumoral NK
cells (Fig. 4B, P < 0.0001). Interestingly, cetuximab therapy
signiﬁcantly upregulated granzyme Bþ and perforinþ cells in
circulating NK cells (P ¼ 0.03 and P ¼ 0.04, respectively; Fig. 4C
and D) while notably upregulating CD107aþ and CD137þ cells
on intratumoral NK cells (P ¼ 0.002 and P ¼ 0.005,
respectively; Fig. 4E and F). The frequency of CD107a and
CD137 positivity was substantially higher on intratumoral NK
cells compared with those of circulating NK cells (P < 0.0001
and P ¼ 0.0002, respectively). The frequency of granzyme Bþ/
perforinþ NK cells was signiﬁcantly higher in PBL compared
with tumor-inﬁltrating NK cells (P < 0.0001), suggesting that a
suppressive mechanism may inhibit full cetuximab-mediated
NK cell activation in the TME.
To determine whether Treg inhibit cetuximab-induced, NK
cell–mediated ADCC in vivo, potentially facilitating tumor
progression, we correlated the frequency of Treg with functional and phenotypic markers of activated NK cells in the TME.
Indeed, CD4þCD25hiFoxp3þ Treg were 7.4 times more
enriched in TIL than in PBL. In the presence of these enriched
Treg, intratumoral NK cells manifested signiﬁcantly impaired

expression of ADCC-related functional molecules, including
granzyme B, perforin, and CD16 compared with those of
circulating NK cells. Indeed, signiﬁcantly lower expression of
granzyme B, perforin, and CD16 on intratumoral NK cells was
observed. In contrast, in PBL, which had a low frequency of
Treg, NK cells maintained intact expression of these cytolytic
molecules (not shown). Thus, a strong inverse correlation exists
between the frequency of Treg and functional impairment of
NK cells in the TME.
On the basis of the association of a high Treg frequency with
the impaired NK cell functional phenotype, we tested whether
HNSCC patient Treg could directly suppress cetuximab-mediated, NK cell–induced ADCC. To this end, we investigated the
effect of CD4þCD25hiFoxp3þ Treg on cetuximab-mediated
ADCC ex vivo, ﬁnding that, indeed, Treg signiﬁcantly suppressed
cetuximab-mediated cytotoxicity (P ¼ 0.002). This effect was
mainly mediated by Treg-derived TGFb1, as the suppression
was signiﬁcantly abrogated using a neutralizing Ab speciﬁc for
TGF-b1 (P ¼ 0.01). IL10 appeared to play a minor role, as little
inhibition of cetuximab-mediated ADCC mediated by Treg
was observed after blockade of IL10 alone (27). Taken together,
this result indicates that Treg inhibit cetuximab-induced TIL
NK cell–mediated cytotoxicity through TGFb1 secretion.

Treg are associated with clinical response to monotherapy with
cetuximab
To further assess the clinical impact of Treg in predicting
response in an independent clinical trial of patients after cetuximab therapy, we compared the extent of Treg induction in
objective clinical responders (using posttreatment CT scan) with
clinical nonresponders. During cetuximab therapy, we found that
clinical responders maintain stable levels of circulating and intratumoral CTLA-4þ Treg (Fig. 5). On the contrary, the frequency of
CTLA-4þ Treg was signiﬁcantly increased among the nonresponder patients' PBL (P ¼ 0.02) and TIL (P ¼ 0.006), indicating that the
induction of Treg negatively impacts on the efﬁcacy of cetuximab
therapy and that selected targets, such as CTLA-4, which deplete
Treg would potentially provide additional therapeutic beneﬁt.

Treatment with ipilimumab enhances cetuximab-mediated
ADCC by eliminating intratumoral Treg
We postulated that selective elimination of CTLA-4þ Treg,
particularly at the tumor site, might improve the antitumor
immunity followed by cetuximab therapy. Recent preclinical
studies also showed that anti-CTLA-4 mAb induced rapid elimination of intratumoral Treg in murine tumor models, which

improve antitumor immunity (28, 29). However, similar results
have not been reported using ipilimumab (anti-CTLA-4 mAb) in
humans. Because ipilimumab is a human IgG1 isotype mAb,
which like cetuximab has been shown to induce NK cell–mediated ADCC (8, 30), we investigated whether ipilimumab could
eliminate intratumoral CTLA-4þ Treg in the presence of NK cells.
To test this possibility, we freshly isolated TIL containing Treg
from a series of HNSCC tumors (n ¼ 6) and incubated them with
ipilimumab in the absence or presence of NK cells. After 72-hour
incubation, the frequency of Foxp3þ intratumoral Treg in CD4þ
TIL was evaluated using a ﬂow cytometry–based cytotoxicity
assay. As shown in Fig. 6A and B, the addition of ipilimumab
together with exogenous NK cells signiﬁcantly reduced (40%)
the proportion of Foxp3þ Treg in CD4þ TIL. Exogenous NK cells
slightly reduced the frequency of TIL Treg even in the absence of

2206 Cancer Res; 75(11) June 1, 2015

ipilimumab compared with TIL control conditions without NK
cells, indicating that circulating NK cells can also deplete TIL Treg
in an ipilimumab-independent manner (P ¼ 0.04; Fig. 6B).
However, NK cells plus ipilimumab did not deplete effector
CD4þTIL (CD25þFoxp3 cells) in the presence or absence of
ipilimumab, conﬁrming that NK cells selectively deplete Foxp3þ
TIL Treg whereas they preserve effector T cells in TIL (Fig. 6C). We
also tested whether myeloid cells can eliminate intratumoral
Treg in the presence of ipilimumab. In contrast to NK cells,
however, myeloid cells did not deplete either intratumoral Treg
or effector cells (not shown), indicating that the presence of
myeloid cells may be dispensable for Treg elimination mediated
by ipilimumab.
Next, we postulated that Treg depletion using ipilimumabmediated NK cell cytotoxicity could overcome the suppressive

activity of Treg against NK cell–mediated HNSCC cell lysis
induced by cetuximab. To test this hypothesis, we added ipilimumab or irrelevant isotype control mAb to the cetuximabmediated ADCC assay system, with cocultured NK and Treg (as
described in Fig. 5). As shown in Fig. 6D and E, the cytolytic
activity of NK cells previously suppressed by intratumoral Treg
was recovered after incubation with ipilimumab (P ¼ 0.03). This
result indicates that ipilimumab could reverse the suppressive
activity and eliminate intratumoral CTLA-4þ Treg in the presence
of NK cells, thus potentially enhancing cetuximab-mediated
ADCC activity.

Discussion
In this report, we describe the unexpected ﬁnding that
cetuximab-based therapy is associated with an increase in
CTLA-4þFoxp3þ Treg in the circulation and in the microenvironment in treated patients with HNSCC from two independent clinical trial cohorts. Indeed, higher levels of Treg correlated with worse prognosis in cetuximab-treated patients with
HNSCC, as recently seen in lung cancer after neoadjuvant
chemotherapy (31). For the ﬁrst time, we also show that
intratumoral NK cell activation and cytotoxicity occurs during
cetuximab therapy, which is primarily inhibited by Tregderived TGFb1, providing a mechanism for their suppressive
effect and impact on clinical course of the disease. Furthermore,
we demonstrated that NK cells can selectively eliminate intratumoral Treg in the presence of ipilimumab, which induces
recovery of cetuximab ADCC activity from Treg suppression.
Importantly, the suppressive effect of these Treg could be
substantially abrogated by ipilimumab-mediated NK cell elimination of Treg, a strategy that has the potential to enhance
cetuximab-treated patient outcomes.
Although Treg are known to be enriched in the TME compared
with peripheral blood, the mechanism underlying Treg enrichment at the tumor site has not been well-elucidated. A recent study
showed that a few dominant Treg clones recruited into tumor sites
were dramatically expanded through TCR responses in the microenvironment (32). However, little information is available
regarding their biologic and clinical impact on mAb-induced
immunity and tolerance in TME after mAb therapy. We previously
proposed that cetuximab induces not only ADCC of NK cells
(8, 30) but also cross-talk between NK cells and DC, leading to
generation of tumor antigen (TA)-speciﬁc TCR (14). Recently, we

www.aacrjournals.org

reported that cetuximab stimulated IFNg production from NK
cells in vitro and subsequently induced DC maturation and
enhanced the generation of TA-speciﬁc CD8þ T cells (12). Because
TGFb1, a critical factor for Treg generation, is abundant in the
TME, this unique environment in conjunction with TCR triggering
for Treg expansion could be promoted by cetuximab therapy in
cancer patients' tumor sites.
Treg are reported to express immune checkpoint receptors and
suppressive molecules, which are involved in generation and
function of Treg. In this study, we demonstrated that single-agent
cetuximab therapy signiﬁcantly increased not only the frequency
of intratumoral Foxp3þCD25hi Treg but also their expression of
CTLA-4, TIM-3, CD39, and TGFb/LAP. Of particular interest is the
expression of CTLA-4 and CD39 that are detected on the majority
of intratumoral Treg, which is further upregulated by cetuximab
treatment. Many studies deﬁne CTLA-4 as an effector receptor in
mediating Treg-suppressive functions (33). For example, Foxp3þ
Treg-speciﬁc loss of CTLA-4 is sufﬁcient to induce fatal lymphoproliferative disease, which is reminiscent of ﬁndings observed in
CTLA-4–deﬁcient mice (34). It has been reported that Treg can
induce indoleamine 2,3–dioxygenase (IDO) activity in antigenpresenting cells through CTLA-4 and CD80/CD86 interaction.
IDO catabolizes tryptophan, which locally depletes tryptophan
and subsequently inhibits proliferation of T lymphocytes. In
addition, IDO is involved in inhibiting NK cell function by
inhibiting activating receptors and cytolytic activity (35). Similarly, it has been suggested that antibody triggering of CTLA-4 can
induce the release of TGFb1 from Treg (36). However, the link
between CTLA-4 and IDO/TGFb1 currently remains controversial,
albeit their critical roles in Treg-mediated immunosuppressive
activities (33). On the basis of the observation showing that
CD39-speciﬁc blocking mAb attenuated immunosuppressive
function of Treg and subsequently restored CD4 and CD8 T cells
(37), it was proposed that blockade of CD39 could also restore NK
cell–mediated antitumor immunity (38). Taken together, these
results suggest that blockade of CTLA-4 or CD39 enzymatic
activity is an attractive target to inhibit immunosuppressive
functions of Treg in the TME, thus enhancing the efﬁcacy of
cetuximab immunotherapy against HNSCC. Treg from patients
with HNSCC potently suppress cetuximab-mediated ADCC
in vitro and correlate directly with phenotypic and functional
impairment in tumor-inﬁltrating NK cells from cetuximab-treated
patients, pointing to inﬁltrating Treg as the primary suppressive
culprit responsible for impairment of cetuximab-mediated NK

cell activation and tumor cell lysis (39). This ﬁnding was consistently reported from patients with non–small cell lung cancer,
showing that Treg potently inhibit NK-mediated and cetuximabinduced ADCC in vitro (31). TGFb1 is a critical factor not only to
induce Treg but also to suppress NK cell functions, such as ADCC
and cytokine production by downregulating FcgRIIIa, CD16. It
has been well-established that cetuximab induces ADCC against
different cancer cell lines, including HNSCC (9, 40, 41). In
addition, several lines of evidence have consistently shown that
intratumoral NK cells possess more severe dysfunctional phenotypes than circulating NK cells; this difference may be mediated

2208 Cancer Res; 75(11) June 1, 2015

via several mechanisms (42–44). Another study showed that
TGFb1 impaired CD16-mediated human NK cell ADCC by inhibiting granzyme A and B expression and IFNg production via
SMAD3 (45). Furthermore, it has been reported that TGFb1
downregulated CD16 expression on peripheral blood NK cells
(46), which parallels the impairment of cetuximab-mediated
ADCC in the patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma
(47). CD107a and CD137 on intratumoral NK cells were significantly upregulated compared with those on circulating NK cells,
indicating that NK cells were actively stimulated, presumably due
to the presence of the targets at the tumor sites. The low level of

granzyme B and perforin in intratumoral NK cells may also reﬂect
on theses NK cell phenotypes following their activation at the
tumor site. In particular, CD107a and CD137 on intratumoral
NK cells were further upregulated during cetuximab therapy,
strongly suggesting that cetuximab-mediated ADCC take place
at the tumor site. These results collectively support our observation showing that Treg suppress cetuximab-mediated ADCC of
NK cells through TGFb1 and might serve as a potential novel
biomarker to predict the efﬁcacy of cetuximab therapy in treating
patients with head and neck cancer.
Recently, two preclinical studies using mouse models showed
that anti-CTLA-4 mAb eliminated intratumoral Treg in a FcgRdependent manner (28, 29). Despite the existence of NK cells,
macrophages, and DC in TIL, addition of ipilimumab alone into
the TIL culture did not reduce the frequency of intratumoral
Treg. This result indicates that these intratumoral NK cells are
not sufﬁciently numerous or functionally capable of eliminating
TIL Treg in the presence of ipilimumab, which may be due to
their impaired cytolytic molecules such as granzyme B, perforin,
and/or CD16 expression. On the basis of our observation that
peripheral NK cells are relatively more cytolytic than intratumoral NK cells and able to eliminate TIL Treg in the presence of
ipilimumab, their directed migration into tumor sites may be
essential to eliminate intratumoral Treg, thus enhancing the
efﬁcacy of cetuximab in the treatment of patients with HNSCC.
