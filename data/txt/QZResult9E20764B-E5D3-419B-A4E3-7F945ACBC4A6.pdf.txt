BACKGROUND: Controversy exists regarding adjuvant oxaliplatin treatment among older patients with stage II and III colorectal
cancer (CRC). This study sought to identify patient/tumor, physician, hospital, and geographic factors associated with oxaliplatin use
among older patients. METHODS: Individuals diagnosed at age > 65 with stage II or III CRC from 2004 through 2007 undergoing surgical resection and receiving adjuvant chemotherapy were identified using the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results program
(SEER)-Medicare database, which includes patient/tumor and hospital characteristics. Physician information was obtained from the
American Medical Association. Poisson regression was used to identify independent predictors of oxaliplatin receipt. The discriminatory ability of each category of characteristics to predict oxaliplatin receipt was assessed by comparing the area under the receiver
operating curve from logistic regression models. RESULTS: We identified 4388 individuals who underwent surgical resection at 773
hospitals and received chemotherapy from 1517 physicians. Adjuvant oxaliplatin use was higher among stage III (colon ¼ 56%, rectum
¼ 51%) compared to stage II patients (colon ¼ 37%, rectum ¼ 35%). Overall, patients who were older; diagnosed before 2006;
separated, divorced, or widowed; living in a higher poverty census tract or in the East or Midwest; or with higher levels of comorbidity
were less likely to receive oxaliplatin. Patient factors and calendar year accounted for most of the variation in oxaliplatin receipt
(area under the curve ¼ 75.8%). CONCLUSIONS: Adjuvant oxaliplatin use increased rapidly from 2004 through 2007 despite uncertainties regarding its effectiveness in older patients. Physician and hospital characteristics had little influence on adjuvant oxaliplatin

INTRODUCTION
In 2011, an estimated 141,210 patients were diagnosed with colorectal cancer (CRC) in the United States, with 49,380
deaths.1 Health care spending for CRC was estimated at $14.1 billion in 2010.2,3 Because the median age at CRC diagnosis is 69 years, older patients account for a substantial portion of the overall CRC disease burden in the United States.4
Adjuvant chemotherapy after surgical resection improves overall survival among older patients with stage III colon
cancer. Three adjuvant chemotherapies are available and include 5-fluorouracil (FU), capecitabine, or the combination of
5-FU or capecitabine with oxaliplatin; no other agents have been shown to improve outcomes.5-8 Adjuvant chemotherapy
with 5-FU compared with surgery alone reduces the risk of death by 24% among older patients with stage III colon cancer.9 Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) demonstrated that adding adjuvant oxaliplatin to 5-FU leads to an incremental
4.2% reduction in death among patients with stage III colon cancer.10-13 However, individuals enrolled in these RCTs
had a median age at diagnosis of 60 to 63 years, and only 17% were  70 years,14 limiting the generalizability of these
findings to older patients. Recent studies15-21 have shown that the addition of adjuvant oxaliplatin to 5-FU or capecitabine
results in minimal, if any, incremental survival benefit for older patients with stage III colon cancer and average risk for
patients with stage II colon cancer. On the basis of these findings, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines now state that there is no demonstrated benefit to the addition of adjuvant oxaliplatin to 5-FU in average-risk stage II
colon cancer or in patients > 70 years.22 The role of adjuvant oxaliplatin in rectal cancer is not yet defined. In light of the
growing concerns regarding the incremental benefits of oxaliplatin in addition to 5-FU in these subgroups and the lack of
RCT evidence regarding its role in rectal cancer, we sought to examine the dissemination of adjuvant oxaliplatin among
older patients and factors influencing its use in routine clinical practice.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Data Sources

The Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results
(SEER)-Medicare database is a linkage of 2 large population-based data sources providing detailed clinical and
health care utilization information on Medicare beneficiaries diagnosed with cancer.23 The SEER registries collect
demographic, clinical, and tumor characteristics, vital status, and cause of death for all incident cancers reported for
individuals residing within one of the registry areas, covering approximately 28% of the United States.24 Patients in
the SEER database are linked to their Medicare Part A, B,
and D (only 2007 and after) claims.25 Nearly all Medicare
beneficiaries are eligible for Part A and almost 93% opt to
enroll in the Part B.26 The SEER-Medicare Hospital File
reports descriptive information for hospitals that are part
of the SEER-Medicare database,27 including whether hospitals were National Cancer Institute (NCI)-designated
cancer centers or participated in cooperative groups for
clinical trials. Medicare claims were linked to the Hospital
file using a unique number. The American Medical Association (AMA) Physician Masterfile data contain information on the characteristics of >1 million physicians in the
United States, which are linked to Medicare claims by
each physician’s Unique Physician Identification Numbers.28-30
Study Cohort

We identified all patients in the SEER data diagnosed at
age 65 years with their first primary stage II or III cancer
of the colon or rectum.31 Exclusions included: diagnoses
at autopsy or death; a missing month of diagnosis; and
those without continuous Medicare Part A and B fee-forservice enrollment for the 12 months before and 8 months
after diagnosis (because health care use and treatment information would not be complete for all patients).
To identify characteristics of the hospital where cancer surgery was performed, we restricted this cohort to
individuals with a surgical claim (ie, colectomy or proctectomy) in the 6 months following diagnosis. If a patient
had surgical claims from multiple hospitals, the first hospital was retained for analysis. We linked the cohort to the
SEER-Medicare Hospital File by the provider number
and year of diagnosis for each patient. Hospitals that did
not match were excluded.
To examine characteristics of physicians providing
chemotherapy, eligible patients had to have at least one
claim for a specific chemotherapeutic agent during the initial chemotherapy treatment period (described below).
The physician with the most chemotherapy-related claims

during the initial chemotherapy treatment period was
considered the treating physician.32 Unique Physician
Identification Numbers that did not match to the AMA
Physician Masterfile were excluded.
Measurement of Adjuvant Oxaliplatin

We categorized patients as receiving adjuvant chemotherapy with or without oxaliplatin, by using the algorithm in
Figure 1. Because adjuvant chemoradiotherapy for rectal
cancer may be delivered pre- or postoperatively, a different exposure window was required for patients receiving
postoperative adjuvant radiotherapy to distinguish
between radiosensitizing chemotherapy and systemic
adjuvant chemotherapy. We defined adjuvant chemotherapy using a 120-day window to avoid misclassifying
chemotherapy for recurrent cancer as adjuvant therapy.
Patients were divided into an oxaliplatin group, those having  1 claim for oxaliplatin within 60 days from the first
chemotherapy claim, and a nonoxaliplatin group, those
without any oxaliplatin claims within 60 days from the
first chemotherapy. The validity of Medicare claims to
identify chemotherapy administration and oxaliplatin has
been previously reported to be high.33,34
Patient Characteristics

Characteristics including year of diagnosis, sex, age at diagnosis (66-69, 70-74, 75-79, 80-84, or  85 years), race/
ethnicity (white non-Hispanic, black non-Hispanic, other
non-Hispanic, Hispanic, or unknown), marital status
(married, single, other [divorced, separated, widowed], or
unknown), and region of residence (Northeast, South,
Midwest, or West) came from SEER. County-level
metropolitan area was defined as metropolitan or nonmetropolitan. Census tract level information about the percentage of residents living below the federal poverty level
served as an aggregate measure of socioeconomic status
and was categorized into quartiles:  4%, 4.01 -  8%,
8.01 -  15%, and > 15.35,36 Each patient’s preexisting
health conditions in the 365 days before diagnosis were
measured using the Klabunde adaptation of the Charlson
Comorbidity Index.37
Hospital and Physician Characteristics

Hospital characteristics included NCI center designation
(none, clinical, or comprehensive), NCI cooperative
membership group count (0 or  1), teaching hospital
status (yes/no), type of hospital (nonprofit, private, or
government), and total bed size, measured in quartiles
(< 204, 204-343, 344-487, or  488). Physician characteristics included medical degree (Medical Doctor
[MD] or Doctor of Osteopathy [DO]), whether the
physician was trained in the United States (yes/no), year

primary specialty (oncology, hematology/oncology, hematology, internal medicine, or other), and sex.
Statistical Analysis

We estimated the proportion of patients receiving adjuvant oxaliplatin by year, cancer site, stage, and other multilevel characteristics. Patient observations were clustered
within hospitals and physicians in a non-nested manner.
Our analysis accounted for this correlation and produced
estimates of marginal (population-averaged) associations.38 We estimated adjusted prevalence ratios (aPRs)
for all variables using multivariable Poisson models with a
log link and generalized estimating equations with an independent working correlation matrix. Stratified analyses
for colon and rectal cancer were performed. Finally, we
assessed the discriminatory ability of a variety of logistic
regression models to determine adjuvant oxaliplatin
receipt by comparing the area under the receiver operating
curve (AUC). Models included combinations of calendar
year and patient/tumor, physician, hospital, and geographic characteristics. All analyses were conducted using
SAS, version 9.2 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC).
RESULTS
We identified 4388 patients diagnosed with stage II or III
CRC who received chemotherapy and met all eligibility

criteria for inclusion (Fig. 2). The study population was
primarily over the age of 70 years at diagnosis (73%),
white non-Hispanic (81%), married (61%), living in a
metropolitan area (84%), and free from comorbidities
(68%). Most tumors were located in the colon (85%) and
diagnosed at stage III (74%) (Table 1).
The majority of the 1517 physicians were male
(81%), MDs (97%), US-trained (67%), medical school
graduates from 1981 or later (56%) with a primary
specialty of oncology or hematology/oncology (76%)
(Table 2). Three percent of the 773 hospitals had a NCI
clinical or comprehensive cancer center designation, and
48% had at least one cooperative group membership.
Almost 40% were teaching hospitals and 62% were nonprofit entities.
The prevalence of adjuvant oxaliplatin treatment
over the 4-year study period was 52% and 46% for
patients diagnosed with colon and rectal cancer, respectively. There was a steady increase in the prevalence of adjuvant oxaliplatin use over time, which was similar for all
site and stage subgroups (Fig. 3). By 2007, 60% and 73%
of stage II and III colon and 52% and 68% of stage II
and III rectal cancer patients, respectively, received
oxaliplatin.
Patients diagnosed in earlier years were less likely to
receive adjuvant oxaliplatin than those diagnosed in
2007 (eg, 2004: aPR ¼ 0.42, 95% confidence interval

monotonic decrease in the likelihood of oxaliplatin

or Midwest (versus West), residing in a nonmetropolitan
area (versus metropolitan area), or in a census tract with a
higher proportion of individuals living under the poverty
level were less likely to receive oxaliplatin. No physicianor hospital-level variables were strongly associated with

Results from the cancer site–stratified analyses were similar, although they were less precise for rectal cancer due
the smaller number of patients (data not shown). Two
exceptions were that among rectal cancer patients, surgical treatment at an NCI comprehensive cancer center
was associated with increased adjuvant oxaliplatin use
(aPR ¼ 1.48, 95% CI ¼ 1.15, 1.90), whereas Hispanic

ethnicity was associated with decreased use (aPR ¼ 0.52,

received oxaliplatin compared with those who had T3
tumors (36%).

Figure 3. Prevalence of adjuvant oxaliplatin use by cancer
site and stage among older patients with colorectal cancer
who received chemotherapy treatment from 2004 through
2007. The annual prevalence among patients with stage II
and III colon cancer is represented by the black dashed and
solid line, respectively, and among patients with stage II and
III rectal cancer by the gray dashed and solid line, respectively. Less than 3% (n ¼ 114) of patients received adjuvant irinotecan during the study period.

The AUC reports the ability of each model to accurately
distinguish between those patients who received adjuvant
oxaliplatin and those who did not. When calendar year
was included alone, the model had fair ability to discriminate oxaliplatin users (AUC ¼ 68%). The addition of
patient/tumor factors enhanced the model’s discriminatory ability (AUC ¼ 75.8%). However, when physician,
hospital, and geographic factors were added separately to
calendar year, the AUC only increased to 68.9%, 68.9%,
and 69.1%, respectively. The full model AUC was
76.6%; therefore, among patients who received chemotherapy, physician and hospital characteristics contributed
very little to the determination of oxaliplatin receipt.
DISCUSSION
This population-based analysis demonstrates substantial
increases in oxaliplatin use among older patients with
stage II and III CRC who received chemotherapy from
2004 through 2007. By 2007, the prevalence of oxaliplatin treatment was 60% and 73% among stage II and III
colon cancer patients, respectively, and 52% and 68%
among stage II and III rectal cancer patients, respectively.
Patient- and tumor-level characteristics, together with calendar year, accounted for most of the discriminatory
power in determining oxaliplatin use in older patients
with CRC, whereas physician and hospital characteristics
contributed little.
Patients treated by providers within the Community Clinical Oncology Program, a network connecting
2044

NCI cooperative groups to community physicians treating cancer patients, were recently found to be more
likely than those who did not to receive adjuvant oxaliplatin.39 Community Clinical Oncology Program data
was not available for our analysis; however, when
restricted to stage III colon cancer patients, we did not
find an association between hospital cooperative group
participation and adjuvant oxaliplatin use (aPR ¼ 0.98,
95% CI ¼ 0.91, 1.05). This discrepancy may reflect
that our study examined a slightly later time period,
potentially weakening the impact of cooperative group
membership on oxaliplatin diffusion. By 2007, 73% of
all older patients with stage III colon cancer in our
study received adjuvant chemotherapy with oxaliplatin,
suggesting that its adoption in routine practice was
rapid and widespread across all physicians. However,
our finding that rectal cancer patients undergoing surgery at an NCI comprehensive cancer center were more
likely to receive adjuvant oxaliplatin compared with
similar patients at hospitals without an NCI designation
may be due to the unique timing and coordination of
surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy required for rectal
cancer treatment. The sex and race/ethnicity of patients
were not predictive of adjuvant oxaliplatin receipt,
which may reflect limited variation in access to care due
to the uniform insurance setting of our study.
Among patient subgroups where RCT evidence is
entirely lacking (ie, stage II and III rectal cancer) or has
shown no benefit (ie, stage II colon cancer),11 we found
widespread adjuvant oxaliplatin use by 2007 in older
patients with CRC. Well over half of all stage II colon
and stage II and III rectal cancer patients undergoing adjuvant chemotherapy received oxaliplatin. Rectal cancer
patients have not been included in RCTs examining adjuvant oxaliplatin and as such, there is no phase III trial
evidence supporting its use. It is possible that higher local
and systemic recurrence rates lead physicians and older
patients to choose adjuvant oxaliplatin treatment40,41;
however, the added toxicity of (neo)adjuvant radiotherapy makes tolerance of adjuvant chemotherapy more
challenging. The question of whether this practice is
appropriate will hopefully be answered by ongoing trials
examining the role of oxaliplatin in adjuvant chemotherapy of rectal cancer (PETACC 6 and German Rectal
Cancer Study Group CAO/ARO/AIO-04). However,
these trials are unlikely to include adequate numbers of
older rectal cancer patients for subanalysis, and therefore
some uncertainty will remain.
Even in colon cancer, the evidence to support the
addition of adjuvant oxaliplatin to 5-FU in older patients

Figure 4. The forest plot summarizes multivariable adjusted prevalence ratio estimates for the associations between multilevel
characteristics and adjuvant oxaliplatin receipt among older patients with stage II and III colorectal cancer who were treated with
chemotherapy. Abbreviations: aPR, adjusted prevalence ratio; AUC, area under the receiver operating curve; CI, confidence interval; NCI, National Cancer Institute; NH, non-Hispanic.

is weak. An initial pooled analysis of 4 RCTs demonstrated that the efficacy of adding oxaliplatin to 5-FU was
similar in older and younger patients with stage III and
metastatic CRC.14 However, 3 recent RCT analyses relying on subgroup or pooled data have reported conflicting
results regarding the efficacy of adjuvant oxaliplatin in
older patients.19,20,42 Two analyses of multiple observational databases found that the addition of adjuvant oxaliplatin treatment may benefit those younger than 75 years
old,17 but for those aged  80 years, any benefit is likely
modest.18 Therefore, because controversy remains regarding adjuvant oxaliplatin in older patients with stage III colon cancer, any potential benefits must be carefully

considered alongside patient preferences and the cost and
risk of adverse events.
Our study has multiple strengths. The cohort
included a large sample derived from population-based
cancer registries linked to longitudinal Medicare claims.
These data were augmented by information from the
AMA and SEER-Medicare Hospital File. The aggregation
of data resulted in a rich data source to examine the influence of multilevel characteristics on the receipt of oxaliplatin. Our analysis reflects patterns of chemotherapy use in
the community setting.
However, our study is limited by the constraints of
the data sources. SEER-Medicare contains information

on many patient and tumor characteristics that may be
associated with treatment patterns, but unobserved factors
such as patient preferences, financial considerations, or
functional status may also influence treatment decisions.
Further linkage efforts to data sources, including electronic medical records or patient surveys, may improve
measurement of these factors for future research. Because
clinical stage was not available in the SEER data, we relied
on pathological staging and as a result may have selected
patients with rectal cancer treated neoadjuvantly who had
a poorer prognosis. Our analysis did not examine withinphysician variation in prescribing using a random effects
framework, which may further illuminate patterns of physician preference regarding the use of oxaliplatin. Finally,
a number of exclusions were made in the creation of our
study population and thus the findings from our analysis
may not be generalizable to individuals aged < 66 years or
those who were managed care enrollees.
In conclusion, following its approval in 2004, adjuvant oxaliplatin was increasingly used to treat patients
with stage II and III CRC, and its use was influenced
strongly by patient, as opposed to physician or hospital,
characteristics. By 2007, 70% of all chemotherapy-treated
patients with stage II and III CRC received adjuvant oxaliplatin, despite no evidence to support its use in rectal cancer and mounting evidence against its use in patients with
stage II colon cancer and older patients with stage III colon cancer. The widespread dissemination of oxaliplatin
into the older population highlights the critical importance of studying the benefits of anticancer therapies in
older patient populations. Future studies should focus on
the comparative effectiveness and safety of adjuvant chemotherapy with oxaliplatin in older patients with stage II
and III rectal cancer, because utilization rates within these
patient groups were substantial and the evidence for benefit and harm are unknown.
