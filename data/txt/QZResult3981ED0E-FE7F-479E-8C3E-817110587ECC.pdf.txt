Summary
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The dissemination of cancer cells from a primary tumor is conventionally viewed as a unidirectional
process that culminates with the metastatic colonization of distant organs. Here we show that
circulating tumor cells (CTCs) can also colonize their tumors of origin, in a process that we call
“tumor self-seeding”. Self-seeding of breast cancer, colon cancer, and melanoma tumors in mice is
preferentially mediated by aggressive CTCs, including those with bone, lung or brain metastatic
tropism. The tumor-derived cytokines IL-6 and IL-8 acted as CTC attractants and the poor-prognosis
markers MMP1/collagenase-1 and the actin cytoskeleton component fascin-1 as mediators of CTC
infiltration into mammary tumors. Self-seeding can accelerate tumor growth, angiogenesis, and
stromal recruitment through seed-derived factors including, in a breast cancer model, the chemokine
CXCL1. Tumor self-seeding could explain the relationships between anaplasia, tumor size,
vascularity and prognosis, and local recurrence seeded by disseminated cells following ostensibly
complete tumor excision.

Introduction

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Cancer progression is commonly segregated into processes of primary tumor growth and
secondary metastasis. In this conventional model, the high cell density and rapid growth rate
of primary tumors are attributed to an ability of cancer cells to sustain unlimited proliferation
and to favorably influence their microenvironment. In contrast, metastasis is thought to depend
on cancer cell dissemination and adaptation to distant organs (Chiang and Massagué, 2008;
Langley and Fidler, 2007; Scheel et al., 2007). Shedding of tumor cells into the circulation may
occur in large numbers and from early stages of tumor formation (Husemann et al., 2008;
Pantel and Brakenhoff, 2004; Stoecklein et al., 2008). Yet overt metastasis is achieved only
by a minority of these dispersed cells. Tight vascular wall barriers, unfavorable conditions for

survival in distant organs, and a rate-limiting acquisition of organ colonization functions are
just some of the impediments to the formation of distant metastasis (Nguyen et al., 2009).
However, these impediments may be less stringent as regards the ability of CTCs to re-infiltrate
their tumors of origin. The neovasculature of tumors is typically leaky (Carmeliet and Jain,
2000; Rafii et al., 2003), a feature that would facilitate not only the passage of tumor cells into
the circulation but also their entry from the circulation back into the tumor. CTCs would likely
need no further adaptation to thrive in the microenvironment of their source tumor. Based on
these theoretical considerations, we have postulated that CTCs may re-infiltrate an establish
tumor, enriching it with aggressive cells that have withstood a period of dissemination. This
process, which we refer to as “tumor self-seeding”, could have consequences for tumor growth
and the breeding of metastatic cell progenies (Norton and Massague, 2006).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

In the present studies we sought experimental evidence for the existence, the features, the
mediators, and the potential consequences of tumor self-seeding. Using human breast, colon
and melanoma cancer cells, we investigated in mice the ability of malignant cells to seed a
tumor from the circulation. The results led us to investigate whether metastatic cells have a
superior ability to seed an established tumor, and whether tumor self-seeding depends on
attraction signals from the tumor mass and infiltrative functions in the circulating seeds. Our
results uncovered various mediators of such attraction and infiltration functions, including
factors whose expression in primary tumors is associated with relapse in patients. These
insights dissect tumor self-seeding into steps of CTC attraction and tumor infiltration, and
highlight the implications of tumor self-seeding for cancer biology and clinical oncology.

Results
Seeding of established tumors by CTCs

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To investigate whether cancer cells that are shed into the circulation can re-infiltrate a primary
tumor mass, we first used MDA-MB-231 (MDA231 for brevity), a breast cancer cell line from
which metastatic subpopulations were previously isolated and characterized (Bos et al.,
2009; Kang et al., 2003; Minn et al., 2005a). The lung metastatic derivative line MDA231LM2 (Minn et al., 2005a), was transduced with a GFP-luciferase fusion vector and inoculated
into one mammary gland in mice to form a “donor” tumor mass. Unlabeled MDA231-LM2
cells were inoculated into a contra-lateral mammary gland to form a “recipient” mass of the
same tumor (Figure 1A). After 60 days, the recipient tumors were excised and examined for
the presence of seeding cells by means of ex-vivo bioluminescence imaging (BLI). A majority
(85%) of the recipient tumors showed extensive seeding by MDA231-LM2 cells (Figure 1B
and Table 1). Tumors formed by the more indolent MDA231 parental population were as
effective as MDA231-LM2 tumors at capturing seed cells (Figure 1B and Table 1). No seeding
was observed in mock-inoculated mammary glands within the same time period (Figure 1C).
Fluorescence microscopy analysis of MDA231 recipient tumors confirmed the presence of
numerous GFP-positive MDA231-LM2 seeding cells as distinct patches typically
encompassing less than a quarter of a tumor section (Figure 1D and data not shown). When
recipient tumors were generated using red-fluorescent protein (RFP)-labeled cells, the
infiltrating GFP+ cells were observed intermingling with resident RFP+ cancer cells and with
unlabeled areas of presumptive tumor stroma (Figure 1E). qRT-PCR analysis of fireflyluciferase mRNA level in seeded recipient tumors revealed that seeder cells accounted for 5%–
30% of the recipient tumor mass (data not shown).
To establish the generality of this seeding phenomenon, we performed similar experiments
with different cancer cell lines. Recipient mammary tumors became seeded with high
frequency (53% to 100% of mice) by donor tumors that were formed with bone metastatic
(MCF7-BoM2), lung metastatic (MDA231-LM2), or brain metastatic (CN34-BrM2) cells from

different subtypes of breast cancer (basal, estrogen receptor-negative MDA231 cells vs
luminal, estrogen receptor-positive MCF7 cells) or patient-derived malignant cell cultures
(CN34 cells) (Figure 1B and Table 1). Seeding of a recipient tumor by its own aggressive
progeny was also observed between subcutaneous tumors formed by the human colon
carcinoma line SW620 and its lung metastatic derivative SW620-LM1, and between the human
melanoma line A375 and its bone metastatic derivative A375-BoM2 (Table 1). These
experiments with human cell lines required the use of immunodeficient mice. However,
seeding was also observed in immunocompetent mice using the syngeneic cell lines 4T1 and
67NR (Table 1). Derived from a spontaneous mouse mammary tumor, 4T1 is highly metastatic
to lungs, liver, bones and brain whereas 67NR is poorly metastatic (Aslakson and Miller,
1992). Moreover, endogenous mammary tumors driven by the polyoma middle T oncogene
(PyMT) in mice were efficiently seeded by PyMT tumor-derived cells placed in the circulation
(Figure 1B; Table 1).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To determine if mammary tumors may be seeded with cells shed from metastatic lesions, we
generated lung tumor colonies by tail-vein inoculation of labeled MDA231-LM2 cells and then
implanted unlabeled MDA231 mammary tumors in the same mice (Figure 1F). Seeding of
these mammary tumors by lung metastasis-derived cells was observed in 10/11 (91%) of mice
(Figure 1G). The extent of seeding was proportional to the level of donor cells in the circulation
(Figure 1G). Collectively, these results indicate that aggressive carcinoma and melanoma cells
shed into the circulation can avidly seed an established tumor mass.
Preferential tumor seeding by metastatic cell progenies

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We compared the ability of metastatic derivatives from SW620, A375 and MDA231 with their
corresponding parental lines to act as donor tumors. In contralateral homotypic tumor seeding
assays, the metastatic derivatives showed an 8- to 35-fold higher seeding ability than their
parental counterparts, as determined by BLI of homotypic recipient tumors (Figure 2A). Next
we carried out in vivo selection experiments to isolate, from the parental MDA231 and A375
cell lines, the cells that most actively seed a tumor mass from the circulation. We inoculated
contralateral mammary glands (MDA231) or contralateral flanks of mice (A375) with
unlabeled (recipient) or GFP/luciferase-labeled (donor) cells, respectively (Figure 2B).
Seeding of recipient tumors was detectable by BLI within 50 days of the inoculation. The
seeded tumors were excised, dissociated, and placed in culture, and the GFP-positive seeder
cell populations (MDA231-S1a, MDA231-S1b, and A375-S1) were obtained from these
cultures by FACS. The tumor seeding ability of MDA231-S1a and MDA231-S1b as
contralateral donor tumors was >100-fold higher than that of parental MDA231 (Figure 2C).
The seeding ability of MDA231-S1a and A375-S1 from the circulation was 6-fold higher than
that of the parental populations (Figure 2D). The S1 populations additionally showed an
increased ability to pass across an endothelial cell layer in trans-well migration assays (Figure
S1).
We chose MDA231 for further analysis because the metastatic composition of this cell line
has been extensively characterized. MDA231 was derived from the pleural fluid of a breast
cancer patient with advanced metastatic disease, and it contains minority subpopulations that
are highly metastatic to either the bones, the lungs, or the brain (Bos et al., 2009; Kang et al.,
2003; Minn et al., 2005a). These subpopulations may represent the disseminated descendants
of different metastatic lesions in the source patient, and are characterized by a differential
expression of distinct gene sets. Several of these genes act as mediators of organ-specific
metastasis in experimental systems and are associated with organ-specific relapse in
independent cohorts of breast cancer patients (Bos et al., 2009; Kang et al., 2003; Minn et al.,
2005a; Minn et al., 2005b).

A comparison of transcriptional profiles uncovered 72 genes (78 probe sets) whose mRNA
level was at least 3-fold higher in the MDA231-S1a and -S1b cells than in parental MDA231
(Table S1). Interestingly, many of these are genes whose expression is characteristic of bone,
lung and/or brain metastatic cell populations (Table S1) (Bos et al., 2009;Kang et al.,
2003;Minn et al., 2005a). The anti-apoptotic gene BCL2A1 was also highly expressed in S1
cells (Table S1). Furthermore, the MDA231-S1a and -S1b transcriptomes were significantly
enriched for the expression of bone metastasis (BoMS), lung metastasis (LMS) and brain
metastasis (BrMS) gene expression classifiers (Figure 2E). These signatures were previously
derived from human breast cancer cells that are selectively metastatic to one of these organs
in mouse models and in patients (Bos et al., 2009;Kang et al., 2003;Minn et al., 2005a;Minn
et al., 2005b). Indeed, when compared to parental MDA231 in metastasis assays in mice, the
MDA231-S1a cells demonstrated a higher ability to colonize the lungs (Figure 2F), the bones
(Figure 2G) and the brain (Figure 2H) from the circulation. Collectively, these results suggest
that tumor self-seeding preferentially involves metastatic cancer cell progenies irrespective of
their organ tropisms.
Tumor attraction and infiltration functions

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To define the basic functions required for tumor seeding by CTCs, we inoculated LacZ/GFP/
Luciferase-expressing MDA231 cells (either parental or LM2) into the arterial circulation (via
the left cardiac ventricle) of mice bearing unlabeled MDA231 mammary tumors (Figure 3A).
This experimental protocol obviates possible differences in donor tumor growth rate or in donor
tumor-derived systemic signals (McAllister et al., 2008) that might confound the interpretation
of our results. The inoculated cells were rapidly distributed throughout the body (Figure 3B,
day 0), and became extensively cleared within a few days except for cells that infiltrated the
mammary tumors (Figure 3B, day 7 and beyond). These cells readily seeded the established
mammary tumors but not the intact or mock-inoculated mammary glands (Figure 3B, day 42).
Furthermore, the highly metastatic MDA231-LM2 cells were more effective at seeding the
recipient tumors from the circulation than were the parental MDA231 cells (Figure 3C). This
effect was already apparent within 10 days after inoculation (Figure 3D), before a marked
outgrowth of the seeding cells took place within the recipient tumor mass. In similar
experiments, the metastatic derivative A375-BoM2 seeded subcutaneous A375 melanoma
tumors from the circulation more effectively than did the parental A375 cells (Figure 3D).
These results suggested that tumor seeding by CTCs involves two distinct functions, namely,
an ability of tumors to attract their own circulating progeny, and an ability of CTCs to infiltrate
tumors in response to this attraction (Figure 3E).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To gain further insight into these attraction and infiltration functions, we performed a transendothelial migration assay in which tumor cell conditioned media was placed in the bottom
well of the chamber (Figure 4A). Media conditioned by MDA231 breast carcinoma or A375
melanoma cells were several-fold more active at stimulating the trans-endotheilal migration
of MDA231-LM2 cells than were media conditioned by MCF10A cells, a human breast
epithelial cell line derived from untransformed tissue (Figure 4B). Similarly, A375-BoM2
melanoma cells migrated through endothelial cell layers more actively in response to these
cancer cell conditioned media than to media conditioned by HaCat cells (Figure 4B), a human
keratinocyte cell line representing the most abundant cell type in skin epidermis. Media from
MDA231 and MDA231-LM2 cultures were equivalent as a source of attraction in these
experiments (Figure 4C), which is consistent with the equivalent ability of these two cell lines
to act as recipient tumors in self-seeding assays (refer to Figure 1B and Table1).
MDA231-LM2 cells are more active at migrating through endothelial cell layers compared to
parental MDA231 cells (Gupta et al., 2007). Conditioned media from either MDA231-LM2
or MDA231 cells further stimulated the trans-endothelial migration of MDA231-LM2 cells

(Figure 4C). Parental MDA231 cells showed low trans-endothelial migration activity even in
the presence of media conditioned by tumor cells (Figure 4C). Similarly, the migration of
A375-BoM2 cells through endothelial layers was several-fold more efficient than that of the
parental A375 cells in the presence of conditioned media from A375 or A375-BoM2 (Figure
4C). These results demonstrated that cancer cells release signals that attract their progeny across
endothelial layers. In addition, these results suggest that aggressive cancer cells are superior
to their more indolent counterparts in their ability to migrate in response to these signals.
Tumor-derived mediators of cancer cell attraction

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To identify candidate tumor-derived attractants for CTCs, we compared the secreted levels of
180 cytokines in conditioned media. This analysis uncovered several cytokines whose
production was higher (IL-6, IL-8, Oncostatin M, and VEGF) or lower (CCL2) in MDA231
and its derivatives than in MCF10A cells (Figure 5A, Figures S2A and B). IL-6 and IL-8
showed the sharpest increase. IL-8 was also the most abundantly secreted cytokine in A375
melanoma cells compared to the HaCat cells. IL-6 and IL-8 are regulators of immune and
inflammatory responses and have been implicated in tumor progression (Hodge et al., 2005;
Kishimoto, 2005). Focusing on these two cytokines, the addition of recombinant IL-6 or IL-8
to media from the corresponding non-tumorigenic cells (MCF10A and HaCat, respectively)
stimulated the trans-well migration of MDA231-LM2, MDA231-S1a and A375-BoM2 cells
(Figure 5B). These effects were maintained or further increased in the presence of an
endothelial cell layer (Figure 5C). IL-8 had little effect on MDA231-LM2 migration (data not
shown), but these cells lack IL-8 receptors (CXCR-1 and 2) (Helbig et al., 2003).
To determine the role of IL-6 on the attraction of MDA231 CTCs in vivo while averting the
confounding effects of IL-6 on tumor vessels, we tested MDA231-S1a cells whose IL-6
receptor (IL6R) expression was inhibited with RNAi (Figure S3A). The knockdown of IL6R
expression significantly decreased self-seeding ability of seeder cells (Figure 5C). The
knockdown of IL6ST (gp130) (Figure S3A), a shared signal transducer for IL-6 cytokine family
members including oncostatin M, strongly inhibited the seeding activity of MDA231-S1a
(Figure 5D). Taken together, these results suggest that tumor-derived IL-6 and IL-8 can
facilitate the self-seeding in these breast carcinoma and melanoma models by functioning as
chemoattractants for circulating tumor cells.
Mediators of cancer cell infiltration of tumors

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The enriched expression of various metastasis-associated genes in the MDA231-S1a and S1b
populations indicated a preferential seeding of tumors by their metastatic cell progenies (refer
to Figure 2E and Table S1). But this alone did not specifically link these genes to the ability
of CTCs to infiltrate a tumor mass. To identify candidate mediators of this function, we
searched this list for pro-invasive genes whose expression in primary breast tumors has been
previously associated with relapse in breast cancer. These criteria were based on the rationale
that expression of such mediators in primary tumor cells would endow these cells with a
potential infiltrative advantage as they pass into the circulation.
These criteria were fulfilled by three genes (Table S1), namely, collagenase 1 (matrix
metalloproteinase 1, MMP1), fascin 1 (FSCN1) and CXCL1. All three genes are implicated in
invasion and infiltration and, most importantly, their expression in breast tumors is associated
with priming of breast cancer cells for seeding of the lungs (MMP1, FSCN1, and CXCL1) and
the brain (MMP1, FSCN1) (Bos et al., 2009;Minn et al., 2005a). These are among the topranked genes by association with lung relapse in the LMS signature in breast cancer patients
(Minn et al., 2005a). MMP1 has been implicated in tumor cell invasion, vascular remodeling
and pulmonary extravasation (Egeblad and Werb, 2002;Gupta et al., 2007). Fascin-1 is an actin
cross-linking protein that functions in the organization of cytoplasmic microfilament bundles

and dynamic, cortical cell protrusions including filopodia, lamellipodia and dendrites (Adams,
2004;Hashimoto et al., 2005). Fascin-1 has been implicated in the migration and invasiveness
of malignant glioma and colorectal carcinoma cells (Hwang et al., 2008;Vignjevic et al.,
2007). CXCL1 is a powerful mediator of leukocyte influx into sites of inflammation (Dhawan
and Richmond, 2002;Kobayashi, 2008) and also participates in the recruitment of endothelial
precursor cells for angiogenesis (Hristov et al., 2007).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Using qRT-PCR, we confirmed that the expression level of FSCN1, CXCL1 and MMP1 was
11-fold to >40-fold higher in the S1a and S1b seeder populations than in parental MDA231
(Figure S3B). To investigate the role of these genes in tumor seeding, we conducted transendothelial migration assays with MDA231-S1a cells in which the expression of these genes
was inhibited with RNAi vectors (Figure S3C–E). Whereas the knockdown of MMP1 or
CXCL1 singly had no effect on trans-endothelial migration, the knockdown of FSCN1
expression significantly decreased this activity (Figure 5E). The combined knockdown of
MMP1 and FSCN1 further decreased this migration, while the combined knockdown of
CXCL1 and FSCN1 did not (Figure 5E). Correlating with these effects, the ability of MDA231S1a cells to infiltrate MDA231 mammary tumors from the circulation was significantly
diminished by FSCN1 knockdown and was further decreased by a combined knockdown of
MMP1 and FSCN1 (Figure 5F). The knockdown of MMP1 (Gupta et al., 2007) or FSCN1
(Figure S3F) had no effect on the growth of MDA231-LM2 cells as mammary tumors. The
combined knockdown of MMP1 and FSCN1 in MDA231-S1a cells also inhibited the ability
of these cells to colonize the lungs of mice from the venous circulation (Figure 5G). These
results suggest that FSCN1 and MMP1, two genes whose expression in primary tumors is
associated with distant relapse to lung and brain in breast cancer patients (Bos et al., 2009;
Minn et al., 2005a), may also mediate the re-infiltration of mammary tumors by CTCs.
Promotion of tumor growth and stroma recruitment by self-seeding

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Aggressive cancer cells may promote tumor growth through the release of paracrine signals
that enhance tumor angiogenesis and the recruitment of a supportive stroma (Carmeliet,
2005; Coussens and Werb, 2002; Joyce and Pollard, 2009; Tisty and Coussens, 2006). To
determine if the seeding of a tumor mass by aggressive CTCs could affect the rate of tumor
growth, we implanted MDA231 mammary tumors in mice and 10 days later we injected LacZ/
GFP/Luciferase-expressing MDA231-LM2 cells into the circulation of these mice. As these
tumors became seeded with MDA231-LM2 cells, the rate of tumor growth was accelerated
compared to that of unseeded tumors (Figure 6A). The increase in the size of seeded tumors
was reflected in an increase in the number of tumor cells and was not due to the less dense
packing of cells (Figure S4A and S4B). Notably, β-galactosidase staining of histological
sections revealed that the LacZ+ seeder cells represented 7% to 19% of the entire tumor mass
which could not fully account for the larger size of these tumors (Figure 6B, C, and data not
shown). Of note, the intrinsic proliferation rate of MDA231-LM2 is similar to that of the
parental MDA231 population (Gupta et al., 2007) and the same applies to the MDA231-S1a
and S1b lines (data not shown). These results argue that a small proportion of infiltrated
MDA231-LM2 cells in a mammary tumor can augment the growth rate of the overall tumor
cell population by paracrine effects on the stroma.
The presence of seeder MDA231-LM2 cells in MDA231 tumors increased the average length
and the extent of branching of tumor capillaries as determined subjectively (Figure 6D) and
by quantitative digital imaging analysis of CD31-stained vasculature (Figure S4C). Moreover,
the seeded tumors contained elevated numbers of infiltrating leukocytes, as determined by
immunostaining for the pan-leukocyte marker CD45 (Figure 6E) (Charbonneau et al., 1988).
Further analysis of recruited leukocytes revealed increased numbers of neutrophils as well as
macrophages (CD68-positive cells) in the seeded tumors (Figure 6F and 6G).

We also investigated stroma recruitment in tumors seeded with 4T1 cells in a syngeneic mouse
mammary tumor model, and A375-BoM cells in a melanoma model. FACS analysis of
recipient tumors revealed that GFP+ A375-BoM2 seeder cells represent about 22–33% of the
cells in seeded tumors whereas GFP+ 4T1 seeder cells accounted for 3–8 % (Figure S5A).
Tumors seeded by 4T1 cells showed an increase in leukocyte recruitment (CD45+), the
majority of which were CD11b+ myeloid cells (Figure 6H). Over 70% of the CD11b+ cells
were also stained with F4/80, a pan macrophage marker (Figure S5B), which is consistent with
previous analysis of stromal composition of 4T1 tumors (DuPre et al., 2007). Analysis of
tumors seeded by A375-BoM2 revealed a limited but significant increase in neutrophil
recruitment (CD45+ Neut+) (Figure 6H).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To provide proof of principle that seeding cells can affect their host tumor through the release
of specific leukocyte-recruiting signals, we turned our attention to the MDA231 model system
and the seeder-derived chemokine CXCL1, which is a mediator of leukocyte influx into sites
of inflammation (Galkina and Ley, 2007). Unlike the knockdown of MMP1 and FSCN1
expression, the knockdown of CXCL1 did not diminish the trans-endothelial migration of
MDA231 cells (refer to Figure 5E) or the extent of seeding of MDA231 tumors with GFP+
MDA231-S1a cells (Figure 6I). However, CXCL1 knockdown in MDA231-S1a cells caused
a significant decrease in the recruitment of CD45+ cells into the stroma of seeded MDA231
tumors (Figure 6I, J). These results are consistent with the expected consequences of an
enrichment of a tumor mass with aggressive cancer cells that secrete stroma-recruiting signals.

Discussion
Based on previous considerations (Norton and Massague, 2006), here we present evidence that
tumor self-seeding is a general phenomenon in experimental models of breast carcinoma, colon
carcinoma and malignant melanoma. In these models, tumor masses become readily seeded
by CTCs derived from a separate tumor mass, from metastatic lesions, or from direct
inoculation. We observed self-seeding with homotypic models using the same cancer cell
population as the recipient tumor mass, and with heterotypic models using cell lines from
different patients and different breast cancer subtypes. While our focus is on seeding of a tumor
by its own circulating progeny, we also observed cross-seeding between mammary and
melanoma tumors (our unpublished results).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The features of tumor self-seeding indicate a process in which CTCs re-infiltrate a tumor mass
based on distinct biological functions, a process that may foster tumor growth and the breeding
of metastatic progenies. Unlike colonization of distant organs, self-seeding requires little, if
any, additional adaptation of CTCs to the recipient microenvironment. However, self-seeding
does select for cancer cell populations that are more aggressive than the bulk population of the
primary tumor. As CTCs, the seeds have undergone selection for movement into, and survival
in the circulation. Moreover, self-seeding is actively driven by the ability of CTCs to sense
attraction signals from the tumor and to extravasate in response to such signals. These functions
are represented in the most aggressive segment of a CTC population, including CTCs that may
have already acquired a full complement of metastatic functions.
Tumor self-seeding selects for highly aggressive CTCs, as shown by our consistent observation
that metastatic cell subpopulations are more efficient as seeders than their parental populations.
Moreover, MDA231 seeder populations recovered from mammary tumors are a mixed
population with a gene expression profile and a multi-organ metastatic phenotype that
recapitulate those of various site-selective metastatic entities present in the MDA231 cell
population. Bone, lung or brain metastatic subpopulations that can be segregated from each
other in experiments of organ-specific metastases (Bos et al., 2009; Kang et al., 2003; Minn et
al., 2005a), emerged as a mixed population when we selected for tumor-seeding cells. If seeding

selects for highly aggressive segments of a CTC population, then seeding may foster the
expansion of potentially metastatic populations in the compatible soil of the primary tumor.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Tumor self-seeding in mice carrying a large load of CTCs was not accompanied with de novo
tumor formation in orthotopic sites (mammary glands or skin), suggesting that self-seeding
requires tumor-derived attraction signals. Our evidence points at IL-6 and IL-8 as tumorderived attractants of CTCs in breast carcinoma and melanoma models. IL-6 and IL-8 have
been implicated in several tumorigenic processes including cancer cell chemoattraction
(Arihiro et al., 2000; Wang et al., 1990; Waugh and Wilson, 2008). High serum levels of IL-6
indicate poor prognosis in breast, colon, and lung cancer (Esfandi et al., 2006; Knupfer and
Preiss, 2007; Schafer and Brugge, 2007), and high expression of IL-8 in metastatic melanoma
is associated with tumor load (Scheibenbogen et al., 1995; Ugurel et al., 2001). Inflammatory
cells recruited to the tumor site can also be sources IL-6 (Balkwill et al., 2005; Grivennikov et
al 2009). Thus, stroma-derived and cancer cell-derived factors may function in combination
to attract CTCs back to a primary tumor.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The superior ability of aggressive cancer cells to infiltrate a tumor in response to this attraction
argues that self-seeding also requires infiltration functions on the part of the CTCs. We show
that MMP1 and fascin-1 expressed by breast cancer cells act as mediators of trans-endothelial
migration and tumor seeding. Expression of MMP1 and FSCN1 in estrogen receptor-negative
(ER−) breast tumors is associated with relapse to lungs and brain (Bos et al., 2009; Minn et al.,
2005a). Our present and previous results (Gupta et al., 2007) are consistent with roles of MMP1
and fascin-1 in cancer cell extravasation– extravasation into distant organs for the development
of metastases but also, as our present results suggest, extravasation into the tumor of origin.
The mediators of seed attraction and tumor infiltration involved in self-seeding may well be
different depending on the tumor type. For example, although IL-6 secretion occurs in ER−
breast cancer cells, no IL-6 expression is detected in various ER+ breast cancer cell lines
(Sasser et al., 2007) or in A375 melanoma. Similarly, MMP1 and FSCN1 expression is
associated with distant relapse in patients with ER− breast cancer but not with ER+ breast cancer
(Minn et al., 2007; Minn et al., 2005a). In principle, seed-attracting signals could include
chemoattractants secreted by tumor cells and/or by inflammatory cells, and tumor infiltration
could involve any mediator of extravasation expressed in CTCs.

The interaction of aggressive cancer cells with the tumor stroma results in the release of signals
that foster tumor growth, angiogenesis, invasion, and metastasis. These signals prominently
include factors that recruit and activate inflammatory cells. Therefore, to the extent that tumor
self-seeding recaptures highly aggressive segments of a CTC population it may result in a
further enhancement of tumor growth through the action of seed-derived signals. Indeed, the
seeding pattern of recipient tumors in our experiments was typically uneven and diffuse, with
the seeding cells remaining a minority that mingled with resident cancer cells and tumor stroma.
The seeding cells did not have an intrinsic proliferative advantage over the bulk population.
Yet, seeded MDA231 mammary tumors grow faster, an increase that is not fully explained by
the added mass of the seeder cells. Enhanced angiogenesis and increased recruitment of
neutrophils and macrophages accompanied the seeded areas of these tumors, and seederderived CXCL1, which is another marker of poor prognosis in ER− breast cancer (Minn et al.,
2007; Minn et al., 2005a), was partly responsible for this recruitment.
It would be premature to conclude at present that enhanced tumor growth is an obligate outcome
of tumor self-seeding. The net effect of self-seeding would likely depend on variables such as
the ratio of the tumor size to the size of the CTC population, the aggressiveness of the CTCs,
the vascularity of the tumor, tumor micro-architecture and other factors that may change in the
course of the disease. Self-seeding may provide harbor in a primary tumor for the expansion

of cancer cell subpopulations that are primed for metastasis. As the shedding and attraction of
CTCs by a tumor mass is a dynamic process, it is also conceivable that the presence of a
substantial tumor mass could transiently decrease the load of aggressive cells in the circulation
owing to their recapture by the tumor.
The present evidence provides clues that could elucidate certain enigmas in clinical oncology.
The long-established association of large primary tumor size with poor prognosis in many types
of cancer, thought to reflect the ability of larger cancers to release more cells of metastatic
potential, may in addition reflect the ability of such aggressive cells to self-seed, promoting
local-regional growth, acting in turn as a locus of expansion of these cells and priming for
distant metastases. Similarly, the association of anaplasia with poor prognosis may be because
micro-anatomical disorganization is a consequence of—and hence a marker of—assertive selfseeding. The hypervascularity of many cancers—and the association of such hypervascularity
with poor prognosis—may similarly be explained. Our observation that a mammary tumor can
be seeded by CTCs derived from lung metastatic nodules raises the possibility of reseeding
after tumor excision as a potential cause of eventual local recurrence. Moreover, that the
phenomenon of self-seeding is hereby linked to tumor-specific, and circulating cell-specific
factors may create opportunities for the development of targeted therapies for the attrition of
residual neoplastic cells from the breast and other organs.

Animal studies—All animal work was done in accordance with a protocol approved by the
MSKCC Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Xenografts were performed on BALB/
c nude, Athymic nu/nu (for reseeding experiments from the circulation) and NOD/SCID mice
(for contralateral seeding experiments) age-matched between 5–8 weeks. Wild type BALB/c
mice were used for studies in syngeneic model. For contralateral-seeding experiments,
typically 5×105 unlabeled and GFP/Luciferse/TK expressing tumor cells, unless noted, were
re-suspended in a 1:1 mixture of PBS and growth-factor-reduced Matrigel (BD Biosciences)
and injected into contralateral No. 2 mammary glands (MDA231) or into flanks of NOD/SCID
mice (A375 and SW 620) in a total volume of 50 µl. At necropsy, recipient tumors were
extracted and imaged for luminescent signals with a Xenogen IVIS system. For experiments
with CN34.BrM2, mice were intraperitoneally injected with etoposide (30mg/kg dissolved in
DMSO, Sigma) 2 days prior to mammary gland injection. For reseeding experiments from the
circulation, 2.5 × 105 and 5 × 105 unlabeled parental MDA231, 67NR and A375 cells were
injected into a mammary gland No.2 or subcutaneously, respectively. Once the tumors became
palpable (50–100mm3), 1×105 GFP/luiferase expressing MDA231-LM2, 4T1 or A375-BoM2
cells injected into the cardiac left ventricle in a total volume of 100 ul. Reseeding was monitored
by bioluminescent imaging (BLI). Recipient tumors were extracted and imaged at the necropsy,
typically 6–7 weeks after mammary gland injection. MMTV-PyMT transgenic mice in which
mammary tumors are developed by the MMTV promoter-driven expression of the polyoma
middle-T oncogene were used for reseeding experiment from the circulation. Cells derived
from one such tumor were transduced with lentivirus encoding GFP/luciferase/TK and used
for intracardiac injection. Tumors were harvested and imaged after 3 weeks. For reseeding
from lung metastases, 2 × 105 MDA231-LM2 cells were injected into the lateral tail vein. After
three weeks, 5 × 105 unlabeled parental MDA-MB-231 cells were injected into a mammary
gland No. 2. After 3–4 weeks, tumors were extracted and imaged. Relative numbers of CTC
from these mice were analyzed as previously described (Gupta et al., 2007) except that primers
against luciferase were used to detect CTCs. Experimental metastasis assays and calculation
of tumor size were done as previously described (Bos et al., 2009; Kang et al., 2003; Minn et
al., 2005a).

In vivo selection of seeder cells—One million unlabeled and GFP/Luciferase/TK
expressing parental MDA-MB-231 or A375 cells were injected as in contralateral seeding
experiments. Fifty days after the injection, recipient tumors were extracted and imaged by BLI
as previously described (Minn et al., 2005a). Two independent seeded tumors by MDAMB-231 cells and one seeded tumor by A375 cells were minced and centrifuged in PBS
containing antibiotics. Samples were then resuspended in DMEM containing 0.125%
collagenase III and 0.1% of hyaluronidase and incubated at 37°C for 2.5 hours with occasional
trituration. Subsequently, samples were trypsinized for 5 min, followed by centrifugation in
DMEM with 10% FBS. Cells were filtered through a 40µm strainer and plated in a T75 flask
with DMEM containing 10% FBS. Cells were expanded in culture for two passages and GFPpositive cells were isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS).
Trans-well migration assays—To generate conditioned media, 10^6 cells were plated on
6cm dish. The next day media was replaced with 0.2% FBS media without growth factors.
After two days, media was collected, centrifugated, and used in trans-well migration assays as
described previously (Gupta et al., 2007). Recombinant human IL-6 and IL-8 were purchased
from R&D systems.

Cytokine antibody array—Cytokine antibody array was performed with conditioned media
from MCF10A, MDA231, MDA231-S1a, MDA231-S1b, MDA231-LM2, MCF7, HaCat,
A375, and A375-BoM2 according to manufacturer’s protocol. The complete array maps (Array
5, 9, and 10) can be found in http://www.raybiotech.com/map_all_m.asp#8.
Statistical analysis—For trans-well migration assays and animal studies in which a value
is quantified relative to a normalized standard, standard deviation was calculated based on the
following formula:

SEM was then calculated by using sd{f/g} /√ n.

Figure 5. Mediators of tumor infiltration by cancer cells

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

(A) Cytokine antibody arrays (Raybiotech) probed with MCF10A, MDA231, and MDA231LM2 conditioned media. The position of IL-6 and IL-8 are indicated. For additional annotation
see Figure S2.
(B) Relative trans-well migration activity (without endothelial cell layer) of the indicated cell
lines, with or without IL-6 or IL-8. n=89–110.
(C) Relative trans-endothelial migration activity of indicated cells with or without IL-6 or IL-8.
n=84–124.
(D) Relative seeding actvity of MDA231-S1a cells expressing the indicated shRNA from the
circulation. n=5–10.
(E) Trans-endothelial migration activity of indicated cell lines. n= 30–45.
(F) Relative seeding activity of MDA231-S1a cells expressing indicated shRNA from the
circulation. n=5–8; error bars, maximum and minimum values.
(G) Lung colonization activity of MDA231-S1a cells expressing indicated shRNAs. n=6–7.
Error bars in all cases represent SEM and p values were based on two-tailed Mann-Whitney
test unless indicated otherwise.

Figure 6. Promotion of tumor growth and stroma recruitment by self-seeding

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

(A) Tumor volumes of MDA231-LM2-seeded and unseeded tumors at the indicated time
points. n= 13–14.
(B, C) β-galactosidase staining of a typical tumor seeded with LacZ+ MDA231-LM2 cells. An
entire tumor section (B) and a ×40 magnification (C) are shown.
(D) CD31 staining of sections from unseeded and seeded tumors.
(E) CD45 staining of sections from unseeded and seeded tumors.
(F) Anti-neutrophil staining of sections from unseeded and seeded tumors.
(G) CD68 staining of sections from unseeded and seeded tumors.
(H) Seeding experiments from the circulation were performed with 4T1 in syngeneic mice and
with A375-BoM2 cells. Recipient tumors were analyzed by FACS. The percentage of stromal
cells positively stained for the indicated markers are shown. P values were calculated based
on two-tailed student’s t-test.
(I) Seeding experiments from the circulation were performed as described in Figure 3A with
MDA231-S1a cells expressing indicated shRNAs. CD45 staining was performed on recipient
tumors 19 days after the injection.
(J) Quantification of CD45 positive cells in tumors seeded by MDA231-S1a control and
CXCL1 knockdown cells. n= 9.
