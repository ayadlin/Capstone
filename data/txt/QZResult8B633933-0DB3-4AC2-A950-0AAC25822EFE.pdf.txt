Abstract
Most breast cancers at diagnosis are estrogen receptor-positive (ERþ) and depend on estrogen for growth and
survival. Blocking estrogen biosynthesis by aromatase inhibitors has therefore become a ﬁrst-line endocrine
therapy for postmenopausal women with ERþ breast cancers. Despite providing substantial improvements in
patient outcome, aromatase inhibitor resistance remains a major clinical challenge. The receptor tyrosine kinase,
RET, and its coreceptor, GFRa1, are upregulated in a subset of ERþ breast cancers, and the RET ligand, glialderived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) is upregulated by inﬂammatory cytokines. Here, we report the ﬁndings of a
multidisciplinary strategy to address the impact of GDNF–RET signaling in the response to aromatase inhibitor
treatment. In breast cancer cells in two-dimensional and three-dimensional culture, GDNF-mediated RET
signaling is enhanced in a model of aromatase inhibitor resistance. Furthermore, GDNF–RET signaling promoted
the survival of aromatase inhibitor-resistant cells and elicited resistance in aromatase inhibitor-sensitive cells.
Both these effects were selectively reverted by the RET kinase inhibitor, NVP-BBT594. Gene expression proﬁling in
ERþ cancers deﬁned a proliferation-independent GDNF response signature that prognosed poor patient outcome
and, more importantly, predicted poor response to aromatase inhibitor treatment with the development of
resistance. We validated these ﬁndings by showing increased RET protein expression levels in an independent
cohort of aromatase inhibitor-resistant patient specimens. Together, our results establish GDNF–RET signaling
as a rational therapeutic target to combat or delay the onset of aromatase inhibitor resistance in breast cancer.

Introduction
Approximately 70% of the breast tumors are positive for
estrogen receptor (ER)-a (called hereafter ER) expression, and
the majority of these rely upon estrogen (E2)-mediated ER
signaling for their growth. Endocrine therapy is the most
common and effective treatment for this subset of breast
cancers; targeting ER function by antagonizing binding of

estrogens to the ER (selective ER modulators, e.g., tamoxifen),
promoting ER degradation (selective ER downregulators, e.g.,
fulvestrant, also known as ICI182,780), or blocking estrogen
biosynthesis (aromatase inhibitors; ref. 1). Aromatase inhibitors have become the ﬁrst-line treatment choice for postmenopausal women with ERþ breast cancers (2). However, de novo
or acquired aromatase inhibitor resistance still limits their
beneﬁt for many patients. Several molecular mechanisms have
been proposed to contribute to aromatase inhibitor resistance.
First, tumor cells can become hypersensitive to residual E2 and
remain dependent on ER signaling for their growth (3). Of
relevance for the current study, some ERþ breast cancer cell
lines cultured long-term under E2 deprivation (LTED) display
ER hypersensitivity to E2, thus modeling breast cancers that
have developed resistance to aromatase inhibitor treatment (4,
5). Second, tumor cells may escape the inhibitory effects of
aromatase inhibitors by increasing ER activity independently
of E2. This can result from EGF receptor (EGFR), HER2, or
insulin-like growth factor-I receptor (IGF-IR) overexpression
(4, 6) leading to the activation of signaling cascades including
the mitogen-activated protein kinase and PI3K/AKT pathways
that promote ER phosphorylation, cell proliferation, and cell
survival (7).
These ﬁndings highlight the concept that combining aromatase inhibitors with therapies targeting signaling pathways

that interact with ER is a strategy to enhance aromatase
inhibitor therapy response and prevent resistance, and have
led to a number of combination therapy clinical trials. For
example, targeting of HER2 with trastuzumab or lapatinib in
combination with the nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitors, anastrozole or letrozole, respectively, has shown clinical beneﬁt
and improved outcome for patients with metastatic breast
cancer compared with treatment with aromatase inhibitors
alone (8, 9). Furthermore, the Breast Cancer Trials of Oral
Everolimus-2 (BOLERO-2) study reported recently that the
mTOR inhibitor, everolimus, combined with the aromatase
inhibitor, exemestane, improved progression-free survival
compared with exemestane alone in patients with ERþ
advanced breast cancer previously treated with the aromatase
inhibitors, letrozole or anastrozole (10). However, despite the
positive outcome of such trials, many patients fail to beneﬁt
from these combined therapeutic approaches. As a consequence, there remains an urgent need to better understand
the mechanisms of aromatase inhibitor resistance, and to ﬁnd
and develop appropriate and more efﬁcient therapeutic
strategies.
Expression of the receptor tyrosine kinase, REarranged
during Transfection (RET), and its coreceptor, GFRa1 [glycosyl
phosphatidylinositol-anchored glial-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) family a-receptor-1] is low in normal breast but
upregulated in a subset of ERþ breast cancers (11–13). Moreover, we have previously shown that the RET ligand GDNF is
upregulated by inﬂammatory cytokines and is expressed on
inﬁltrating stromal ﬁbroblasts and to a lesser extent by tumor
cells in xenograft models (11). In RETþ ERþ breast cancer cells,
GDNF stimulation results in an E2-independent increase in ER
phosphorylation and transcriptional activity (13). However,
little is known about the transcriptional program associated
with GDNF–RET signaling in breast cancer cells or the relevance of this pathway to human disease. In particular, a role for
GDNF–RET signaling in response and resistance to aromatase
inhibitor treatment has yet to be explored. In this study, we
have identiﬁed a GDNF response gene set (RGS) with prognostic and predictive value in breast cancer, and have shown
the use of targeting GDNF–RET signaling in the context of
aromatase inhibitor treatment.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines and assays
All cell lines were short tandem repeat (STR) proﬁled in
December 2012 by DNA Diagnostic Centre (DCC). MCF7 cells
used in the microarray experiments were maintained long
term in phenol red-free RPMI-1640 medium plus 10% dextran
charcoal-treated (DCC) FBS, 1 nmol/L E2 (Sigma), 2 mmol/L
L-glutamine, 50 U/mL penicillin, and 50 mg/mL streptomycin.
LTED cells were generated as previously described (4) by
culturing cells in phenol red-free RPMI-1640 plus 10% DCC
for a minimum of 20 weeks. MCF7, T47D, and ZR75-1 cells
were cultured over the same period in phenol red-free RPMI1640 supplemented with 10% FBS, 10 mg/mL insulin, and 1
nmol/L E2. MCF7 cells expressing full-length human aromatase (MCF7-2A) at clinically relevant levels or transfected
the pBabeneo backbone (MCF7-neo) have been previously

3784

Cancer Res; 73(12) June 15, 2013

described (14). MCF7-2A and MCF7-neo cells were maintained
in RPMI-1640 containing 10% FBS, 2 mmol/L L-glutamine,
and 1 mg/mL Geniticin/G418 (Invitrogen). For functional
analysis, cells were E2 deprived for 3 days by culturing in
phenol red-free RPMI-1640 supplemented with 10% DCC.
Cell-based assays, siRNA transfection, immunohistochemistry, antibodies, and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR)
analysis were as described previously (11, 13) except the TaqMan probe sets (Applied Biosystem): RET (Hs00240887_m1),
GFRA1 (Hs00237133_m1), ESR1 (Hs00174860_m1), PGR
(Hs01556702_m1) and the following antibodies (Cell Signaling
Technology): phospho-RET-Tyr905 (#3221), phospho-c-Jun
(#2361), and c-Jun (#9165).
Generation of the GDNF-RGS
MCF7 cells were E2 deprived for 3 days and then serumstarved overnight in the presence or absence of 100 nmol/L
ICI182,780 (Tocris Bioscience). The following day, cells were
treated with GDNF (20 ng/mL) for 0, 4, 8, 24, and 48 hours in the
presence or absence of ICI182,780. Triplicate samples from 3
independent experiments were hybridized onto wholegenome HumanHT12_v3 Expression BeadChips (Illumina) by
the Genomics Services Group, Wellcome Trust Centre for
Human Genetics. Data were extracted using BeadStudio (Illumina) software and were transformed and normalized using
variance-stabilizing transformation and robust spline normalization method in the Lumi (2.6.0) package in R (http://www.
bioconductor.org). Probes were discarded if they were not
detected in any of the samples (detection P > 0.01). Microarray
data have been submitted to ArrayExpress database (E-MEXP3662). To identify genes signiﬁcantly regulated by GDNF
treatment, a conﬁdence score (15, 16) was calculated for each
gene at each time point of GDNF treatment. Conﬁdence score
was deﬁned as the sum of individual scores given for fold
change, P value, expression level, and present calls.
Analysis of clinical datasets
Breast cancer subtypes in the NKI295 and Pawitan datasets
were as reported by the authors. In TransBig dataset, the
subtypes were retrieved and classify using PAM50 from ROCK
(17). An unscaled GDNF-RGS score that recapitulates the
degree of similarity to MCF7 cells upon GDNF treatment was
generated as described previously (18). Thus, a high tumor
GDNF-RGS score corresponds to a signature highly concordant with GDNF activation in MCF7 cells.
Kaplan–Meier analysis and multivariate Cox proportional
hazard regression analysis were carried out with the survival
(2.36–12) and survplot (0.0.6) packages in R. GDNF-RGS–
positive and -negative tumors were classiﬁed using the centroid Spearman correlation method with the nearest centroid
more than 0.1 as described previously (19). The sample was not
assigned if the correlation was 0.1 or less.
Correlation of GDNF-RGS with response to letrozole
The cohort of patients treated with neoadjuvant letrozole
has been described previously (20). Brieﬂy, core biopsies from
ERþ tumors were collected pre and post-14 days letrozole
treatment and subject to gene expression analysis. Response

was classiﬁed on the basis of tumor volume reduction after 3
months letrozole treatment as assessed by ultrasound. Patients
with more than 50% reduction in tumor volume were considered responders. Follow-up data were available for 52 of the
58 patients. To examine the association between the GDNFRGS, the log2 intensity (median centered) of the 53 out of
67 GDNF-RGS genes available in the dataset were extracted
using the ROCK database. When multiple probe sets mapped
to the same gene, the one with the highest variance in the
dataset was selected.

Results
GDNF–RET signaling is enhanced in an in vitro model of
aromatase inhibitor resistance
MCF7-LTED provides a widely accepted model of breast
cancer cells that have developed resistance to aromatase
inhibitor treatment (21). To investigate GDNF–RET signaling
in the context of aromatase inhibitor resistance, we monitored
the time-dependent changes in RET, its coreceptor, GFRA1 and
ESR1 mRNA expression in MCF-7 cells, and in 2 additional ERþ
cell lines (T47D and ZR75-1) during E2 deprivation (Supplementary Fig. S1A). Compared with parental MCF7 cells, MCF7LTED cells show a marked increase in RET and ER mRNA and
protein expression (Fig. 1A). This increase in RET expression is
comparable with that observed in an independent model of E2deprived MCF7 cells (22). Compared with MCF7 cells, parental
T47D cells express lower levels of RET (Fig. 1A) but retain
responsiveness to GDNF/GFRa1 treatment (12). As previously
reported (12), parental ZR75-1 have the lowest level of RET
expression. In contrast to MCF7-LTED cells, T47D-LTED and
ZR75-1-LTED cells have undetectable levels of ER, RET, and
GFRA1 (Fig. 1A) and do not respond to GDNF/GFRa1 treatment (Supplementary Fig. S1B). RET expression can be regulated by ER activation (12, 23), and in the in vitro cell models
used here, RET expression levels mirror the levels of ER
expression (Fig. 1A). Moreover, when parental MCF7 cells are
cultured in the presence of E2, RET expression is enhanced and
this can be blocked by ICI182,780 treatment that targets ER for
proteasomal degradation (Fig. 1B). MCF7-LTED cells are
hypersensitive to residual E2 (4, 5), and in the absence of
exogenously added E2, a higher level of RET expression is
observed (Fig. 1A and B). E2-mediated ER activation in these
cells again results in increased RET expression that can be
blocked by ICI182,780 treatment (Fig. 1B).
As the majority of the breast tumors that display endocrine
therapy resistance retain ER expression, we used MCF7-LTED
cells to investigate GDNF–RET signaling in the context of
aromatase inhibitor resistance. The increased RET expression
in MCF7-LTED cells is mirrored by enhanced GDNF–RET
downstream signaling including increased ER activation monitored by Ser167 and Ser118 phosphorylation (Fig. 1C; ref. 24)
and transcriptional upregulation of E2-dependent genes, TFF1
and PGR (Fig. 1D). Notably, the upregulation of TFF1 and PGR,

www.aacrjournals.org

but not that of the ER-independent gene EGR1, is inhibited in
the presence of ICI182,780. Consistent with their higher levels
of RET expression and more sustained GDNF-induced RET
signaling, MCF7-LTED cells show increased GDNF-induced
transcriptional activation compared with MCF7 cells (Fig. 1D).
NVP-BBT594 impairs GDNF–RET signaling and GDNFdependent growth of MCF7-LTED cells
Blocking RET with nmol/L concentrations of the RET inhibitor, NVP-BBT594 (Fig. 2A) or siRNA transfection, (Supplementary Fig. S1C) shows that GDNF signaling and ER phosphorylation are mediated solely via the RET receptor. Similarly,
NVP-BBT594 blocks the GDNF-mediated enhancement of
MCF7-LTED cell viability in two-dimensional (2D) culture (not
shown) and three-dimensional (3D) colony formation (Fig. 2B).
Compared with MCF7-LTED cells, parental MCF7 cells form
smaller colonies in 3D culture but respond to GDNF and NVPBBT594 treatment. The addition of 10 pmol/L E2, to mimic the
E2 level in postmenopausal patients that have relapsed on
aromatase inhibitor treatment and ceased aromatase inhibitor
therapy, increases 3D colony formation of both MCF7 and
MCF7-LTED cells, and this effect is efﬁciently reverted by NVPBBT594 (Fig. 2B). Parental T47D cells cultured in the absence of
E2 and parental ZR75-1 cells, with or without E2, do not form
colonies when cultured on Matrigel (Fig. 2C and D and
Supplementary Fig. S1D). However, as previously reported
(12) when parental T47D cells are cultured in presence of low
level E2, GFRa1/GDNF stimulation results in increased 3D
colony formation, which is signiﬁcantly reverted by NVPBBT594 (Fig. 2C). Conversely, consistent with their low-level
ER and RET expression (Fig. 1A and B), T47D-LTED and ZR751-LTED cells do not respond to GFRa1/GDNF stimulation and
minimally respond to the presence of E2 (Fig. 2C and D and
Supplementary Fig. S1C). Importantly, NVP-BBT594 has no
signiﬁcant impact on T47D-LTED and ZR75-1-LTED 3D colony
formation showing that the effects observed in MCF7-LTED
cells are due to selective RET inhibition by NVP-BBT594 rather
than off-target toxicity.
GDNF-promoted aromatase inhibitor resistance can be
reverted by RET inhibition
To assess further the effect of GDNF signaling in the
response and adaptation to aromatase inhibitor treatment,
we used MCF7 cells expressing aromatase enzyme (MCF7-2A)
or the backbone vector (MCF7-neo). Treatment with androstenedione, which is converted into estrogens by aromatase,
results in a concentration-dependent increase in MCF7-2A cell
growth, but has no effect on MCF7-neo cells (Supplementary
Fig. S2A). Conversely, increasing concentrations of letrozole, or
the alternate aromatase inhibitors, exemestane and anastrozole, in the presence of androstenedione impair MCF7-2A, but
not MCF7-neo, cell survival (Supplementary Fig. S2B). Consistent with the known E2-mediated modulation of RET expression (see Fig. 1B; refs. 12, 23), MCF7-2A cells show increased
RET levels compared with MCF7-neo cells, and in both cell
lines RET expression is reduced by E2 deprivation (Fig. 3A).
Treatment with androstenedione restores basal RET mRNA
and protein expression in the MCF7-2A cells but has no effect

GDNF stimulation of aromatase inhibitor sensitive MCF72A cells results in RET autophosphorylation, activation of

Consequently for cell-based assays, MCF7-2A cells were cultured with 10 nmol/L androstenedione. GDNF administration

Identiﬁcation of GDNF response genes in breast cancer
cells
The preclinical in vitro models described here, together with
our previous ﬁndings (13), suggest that increased RET expression and activation in ERþ breast cancers can promote resistance to endocrine therapy. However, the transcriptional
program induced by GDNF–RET signaling in ERþ breast
cancer cells and in particular the role of GDNF-induced ERdependent versus ER-independent signaling in response to

endocrine therapy is unknown. To address this, E2-deprived
MCF7 cells were pretreated with or without ICI182,780 that
targets ER for proteasomal degradation and thereby blocks
expression of ER-dependent genes (Supplementary Fig. S3A).
Cells were then GDNF stimulated for 0, 4, 8, 24, or 48 hours, and
RNA from 3 independent experiments was subject to gene
expression proﬁling. Hierarchical cluster analysis shows that
the samples divide into ICI182,780-treated and -untreated
groups and that within these 2 groups, the samples cluster
according to early (4–8 hours) and late (24–48 hours) GDNF
response (Fig. 4A). qRT-PCR of independent samples was
used to validate the gene expression proﬁling and conﬁrms
that GDNF treatment induces transcriptional activation of

between the GDNF-regulated genes in MCF7 cells and other
growth factor response gene sets indicating that GDNF-regulated genes do not have a substantial overlap with other growth
factor signaling pathways.
To detect genes signiﬁcantly regulated by GDNF, a conﬁdence score was calculated for each gene at each time point of
GDNF treatment with a cut-off of 11.0, as reported previously
(15, 16). Eighty-three genes, 50 upregulated and 33 downregulated, were identiﬁed (Fig. 4B and C and Supplementary
Table S1B). Gene ontology analysis revealed that a signiﬁcant
fraction of the GDNF-regulated genes are functionally associated with immune system processes, apoptosis, and response
to stimulus (chemical, oxidative stress, biotic; Supplementary
Table S1C). A comparison of the gene expression proﬁles in the
presence and absence of ICI182,780 revealed that 42 out of 50
(84%) and 18 out of 33 (54.5%) of GDNF-upregulated and
-downregulated genes, respectively, were fully or partially
dependent on ER (Fig. 4C). A comparison of GDNF-regulated
genes with a comprehensive E2-regulated gene dataset (25)
revealed that not all of the GDNF/ER-dependent genes are
reported to be E2 dependent (Fig. 4C). This suggests that GDNF
treatment can promote ER-mediated transcription of a subset
of genes that are independent of the canonical E2 pathway
involving estrogen response element sites. This is consistent
with a previous study (26) that reported a subset of EGFinduced ER genomic targets that are distinct from those
induced by E2 (see Discussion).
A proliferation-independent GDNF-RGS positivity
correlates with poor clinical outcome
It is well established that proliferation-related genes can
dominate gene expression signatures, which de facto identify
highly proliferative tumors (27). Consequently, the 83 GDNFdependent gene list was robustly ﬁltered (Supplementary Fig.
S4). First, all potential proliferation-related genes based on
Gene ontology analysis were removed. Second, genes previously reported in 2 independent proliferation metagene signatures were removed (28, 29). Finally, the remaining 69 genes
were correlated to Ki67 protein levels and TOP2A expression in
a dataset of 81 ERþ breast cancers (30). Genes that showed rs >
0.5 or rs < 0.5 were removed to generate the ﬁnal GDNF-RGS
comprising 67 proliferation-independent genes (Fig. 4B and
Supplementary Table S1). The proliferation-independent
GDNF-RGS is largely populated by GDNF late response genes
and, as a result, the GDNF-RGS score is higher in the samples
treated with GDNF for 24 to 48 hours (Fig. 4D). ICI182,780 has a
signiﬁcant impact on the GDNF-RGS score as 54 out of 67 of the
GDNF-RGS genes are ER dependent (Fig. 4C). However, samples that were GDNF treated in presence of ICI182,780 for 24 to
48 hours show a higher GDNF-RGS score than untreated
samples (without GDNF and without ICI182,780 pretreatment)
indicating that GDNF-dependent ER-independent genes are
accounted for within the GDNF-RGS score (Fig. 4D).
Breast cancers can be divided into molecular intrinsic
subtypes that differ in their gene expression and clinical outcomes. Among the ERþ breast cancers, 2 subtypes can be
distinguished: luminal A and luminal B (31). The GDNF-RGS
score differs signiﬁcantly between subtypes (ANOVA: P <

0.001; Fig. 5A–C) with a Bonferroni-corrected analysis showing
that GDNF-RGS score is higher in luminal B than in luminal A
tumors in all 3 datasets analyzed (Fig. 5A, P < 0.001; Fig. 5B, P <
0.05; Fig. 5C, P < 0.001; refs. 32–34). Furthermore, analysis of 597
breast cancer samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (http://
cancergenome.nih.gov) using the ROCK database (17) shows
that amongst the 5 intrinsic breast cancer subtypes, expression
of the RET ligand GDNF is highest in the luminal B subtype
[Signiﬁcance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM) score ¼ 0.007; q
value ¼ 0.02]. Within ERþ breast cancers, luminal B tumors are
characterized by poorer prognosis when compared with luminal A tumors (35), indicating that the GDNF-RGS and expression of GDNF associate with a clinically relevant molecular
subtype of breast cancer. Consistent with this, using the
nearest centroid method (19), GDNF-RGS positivity in ERþ
cancers signiﬁcantly associates with a decrease in distant
metastases-free survival (DMFS; Fig. 5A, right) and in
relapse-free survival (RFS; Fig. 5B and C, right). Equivalent
results are obtained when patients are stratiﬁed accordingly to
their GDNF-RGS score (Supplementary Fig. S5). A signiﬁcant
association of GDNF-RGS positivity with decreased overall
survival, RFS, or DMFS is also found if all cases are analyzed
independently of their hormonal status (Supplementary Fig.
S6). Importantly, multivariate Cox analysis reveals that the
GDNF-RGS has an independent prognostic value in all 3
datasets analyzed (Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. S6). Finally,
these analyses indicate that patients bearing tumors characterized by active GDNF signaling have a signiﬁcantly worse
outcome either in the presence (NKI295, Pawitan) or absence
(TransBig) of adjuvant treatment (Fig. 5; Table 1).
GDNF-RGS correlates with response to aromatase
inhibitor treatment
We next evaluated whether the GDNF-RGS correlates with
response to aromatase inhibitor treatment by retrieving gene
expression data from biopsies of 52 ERþ breast cancers taken
before and after 2 weeks of neoadjuvant letrozole treatment
(20). The patients were subsequently divided into responder
and nonresponder groups deﬁned by a more than 50% and less
than 50% reduction, respectively, in tumor volume following a
further 3 months of aromatase inhibitor treatment. Pairwise
comparison shows a signiﬁcant decrease in GDNF-RGS score
after 2 weeks of letrozole treatment in the responder cohort (P ¼
0.009) but not in the nonresponder cohort (P ¼ 0.804; Fig. 6A).
To validate these ﬁndings, we examined the effect of the
nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor, anastrozole, on the GDNFRGS score using gene expression data and Ki67 staining
available for 69 paired ERþ tumors biopsies taken pre- and
post 2 weeks of neoadjuvant anastrozole treatment (30). In
such studies, a lack of response to aromatase inhibitor treatment as monitored by a decrease in Ki67 staining has been
shown to predict poor long-term disease outcome (1). The
GDNF-RGS score does not correlate with levels of Ki67 in the
pretreatment samples (Supplementary Fig. S7A–S7C) consistent with the absence of proliferation-related genes within the
GDNF-RGS. However, this pretreatment GDNF-RGS score
shows a relatively weak but statistically signiﬁcant correlation
with the proportional 2-week change in Ki67 (rs ¼ 0.24,

P ¼ 0.047; Supplementary Fig. S7A). Furthermore, the change in
GDNF-RGS score in the pre- and posttreatment samples
positively correlates with posttreatment Ki67 (rs ¼ 0.32, P ¼
0.007) and with the proportional 2-week change in Ki67 (rs ¼
0.35, P ¼ 0.0035; Supplementary Fig. S7B and S7C). These data
support the concept that GDNF-RET signaling plays an important role in the response and adaptation of patients with breast
cancer to aromatase inhibitor treatment. Conversely, GDNFRGS did not stratify for outcome in patients with ERþ breast
cancer that had exclusively received tamoxifen as adjuvant
therapy (Supplementary Fig. S7D and S7E). This suggests that
the different mechanism of action of aromatase inhibitor and
tamoxifen in breast cancer may inﬂuence the ER-dependent
GDNF-mediated transcriptional proﬁle.
RET expression increases in aromatase inhibitorresistant breast cancers
GDNF exerts its function as a ligand for the RET receptor
tyrosine kinase (36). We have previously reported that RET
expression is enhanced in primary tumors from patients who
subsequently developed invasive recurrence after adjuvant
tamoxifen treatment (13). To assess changes in RET protein
expression in response to aromatase inhibitor, we stained 52
paired samples of primary breast cancers and locally recurrent

www.aacrjournals.org

or metastatic tumors arising after adjuvant aromatase inhibitor treatment (Fig. 6B and C; ref. 37). RET expression is
detected in 55.8% (29 out of 52) of the primary tumors. This
percentage of RET-positive tumors is comparable with that
reported for tamoxifen-resistant tumors (59.6%) and is significantly higher than found in a nonselected group of ERþ
invasive breast cancers (37 out of 126; 29.4%; ref. 13). This
reﬂects the fact that the majority of patients in the aromatase
inhibitor-treated cohort had previously received adjuvant
tamoxifen treatment. After developing resistance to aromatase
inhibitor treatment, RET expression is detected in 73.1% (38
out of 52) with a borderline statistical signiﬁcance (c2, 2-tailed:
P ¼ 0.065) compared with the paired pretreatment samples. As
expected, ER expression was retained in the majority of postaromatase inhibitor-treated samples with no signiﬁcant
change in ER H-score (Fig. 6C and Supplementary Fig. S8).

Discussion
In this study, we highlight the GDNF-RET pathway as an
important determinant of resistance to aromatase inhibitor
treatment in ERþ breast cancers. Crucially, direct inhibition of
GDNF-RET signaling by the NVP-BBT594 compound in ERþ
breast cancer cells enhances the sensitivity to aromatase
inhibitor treatment and reverts aromatase inhibitor resistance.

In addition, we have linked gene expression data derived from
an in vitro experimental model to clinically relevant tumor
samples. In particular, we have derived a proliferation-independent GDNF transcriptional proﬁle and show that this
correlates with worse prognosis and poor response to aromatase inhibitor treatment in patients with breast cancer.
A major concern in the generation of growth factor gene
response signatures is that the signature can be dominated by
proliferation-related genes. As extensively reported, proliferation-related gene signatures correlate with higher proliferating
and higher grade tumors, and consequently with poor prognosis (27). GDNF is a weak mitogen for breast cancer cells (11,
12) but interrogation of the gene expression data shows that
the GDNF-induced transcriptional program included serum
and other mitogen response pathways (Supplementary Tables
S1A and S1C). As a consequence, the initial list of 83 genes
signiﬁcantly regulated by GDNF with a conﬁdence score 11 or
more was subject to robust ﬁltering to remove 16 proliferationrelated genes (Supplementary Fig. S4) to generate a 67 gene
GDNF-RGS. The effectiveness of this approach is evidenced
by the lack of correlation of the GDNF-RGS with levels of Ki67
staining and TOP2A expression in primary tumor samples
(Supplementary Fig. S4). Furthermore, the absence of proliferation genes within the GDNF-RGS has important implications for the observation that the GDNF-RGS associates with
the luminal B subgroup of breast cancers. Clinically, luminal B
tumors have a poorer prognosis compared with luminal A
tumors with an increased risk of early relapse with endocrine

therapy and increased resistance to chemotherapy (31, 38). The
data presented here suggest that the GDNF-mediated RET
signaling in breast cancer cells triggers a transcriptional program associated with a more aggressive tumor phenotype
independently of promitogenic effects. Importantly, we show
that the GDNF-RGS signiﬁcantly correlated with a decrease in
DMFS and in RFS (Fig. 5) in patients with breast cancer.
Although a demonstration of prognostic value is of interest,
more importantly this study revealed that a GDNF-RGS score is
predictive for response to aromatase inhibitor treatment in 2
independent studies (Fig. 6A and Supplementary Fig. S7A–
A7C). Moreover, the correlation of the change in GDNF-RGS
and the change in proliferation index of the tumors indicates
that activation of GDNF signaling is also associated with the
response to aromatase inhibitor treatment. Clues as to the
mechanism by which GDNF–RET signaling may promote the
response and adaptation of breast cancers to aromatase
inhibitor treatment have come from taking a global approach
to examine GDNF–RET signaling in breast cancer cells. First,
this study has revealed that GDNF can promote both E2independent activation of ER (Figs. 2 and 3) and a noncanonical ER transcriptional program (Fig. 4C). Promotion of a
noncanonical ER cistrome has been reported in breast cancer
cells following EGF stimulation in a process dependent on the
transcription factor AP-1 (26). It is of note that GDNF stimulation of MCF7-2A cells activates c-Jun (Fig. 3B), a key
component of the AP-1 complex. Second, the GDNF-RGS is
enriched with genes related to immune response pathways,
in particular STAT1 target genes (Fig. 4B and Supplementary
Table S1). STAT1 mediates the inﬂammatory response of IFN.
IFN-related genes, such as ISG15, OAS1, IFI27, and OAS3 that
are present in the GDNF-RGS, have been associated previously
with radiation and chemotherapy resistance in breast and
other cancers (39–41). Similarly, Dunbier and colleagues have
identiﬁed an inﬂammatory gene expression signature associated with poor response to neoadjuvant aromatase inhibitor
treatment (30). In contrast to these reports, others have shown
that an immune-related signature is associated with better
prognosis in triple-negative and HER2þ breast cancers (28, 42)
and that the presence of tumor-associated lymphocytes predicts good response to chemotherapy (43) and good clinical
outcome in ER cancers (44). These contrasting reports
highlight the complex role of the immune system in different
breast cancer subgroups and in the response to different
therapeutic regimes. What is notable in this study is that the
GDNF-RGS was derived from the MCF7 experimental model
rather than from tumor specimens containing both tumor and
stromal cells. This suggests that within the GDNF-RGS-positive
tumors, the tumor cells are actively involved in the immune
response. We have previously shown that GDNF is secreted in
response to proinﬂammatory cytokines by both tumor cells
and stromal ﬁbroblasts (11). This raises the possibility that
GDNF-mediated upregulation of immune response pathways
can reinforce GDNF signaling to promote cell survival in the
aromatase inhibitor-resistant setting.
Despite the ability to identify breast cancer subsets, predict
disease outcome, and/or response to therapies (45, 46), there is
still a lack of well-deﬁned targets causally associated with

Targeting GDNF–RET Signaling in Aromatase Inhibitor resistance

desirable to target common downstream pathways in ERþ
breast cancers. mTOR inhibitors have shown a beneﬁcial effect
on progression-free survival when combined with aromatase
inhibitor therapy (10). However, as shown here, GDNF activates multiple downstream pathways and, given the adaptability of tumor cells, targeting only one is likely to lead to
compensatory upregulation of others. Such compensatory
mechanisms have been well documented, for example, inhibition of mTOR in breast cancer cells results in enhanced IGFIR signaling by abrogating a negative feedback loop (50).
Similarly, we show that blockade of GDNF-induced MEK/
ERK1/2 and PI3K signaling in MCF7-2A cells results in
increased AKT and c-Jun phosphorylation, respectively (Supplementary Fig. S2).
Here, we show using a multidisciplinary approach that
GDNF–RET signaling is an important determinant of aromatase inhibitor therapy response and resistance in ERþ
breast cancers. The priority now is to determine whether
RET inhibition is achievable in the clinical setting to prolong
the efﬁcacy of aromatase inhibitors in recurrent and/or
metastatic disease and whether targeting growth factor
signaling pathways in combination with an aromatase inhibitor could prevent or delay the onset of aromatase inhibitor
resistance.
