Abstract
Solid tumor dissemination relies on the reprogramming of molecular pathways controlling chemotaxis.
Whether the motility of nonsolid tumors such as leukemia depends on the deregulated expression of molecules
decoding chemotactic signals remains an open question. We identify here the membrane remodeling F-BAR
adapter protein Cdc42-interacting protein 4 (CIP4) as a key regulator of chemotaxis in chronic lymphocytic
leukemia (CLL). CIP4 is expressed at abnormally high levels in CLL cells, where it is required for CCL19-induced
chemotaxis. Upon CCL19 stimulation of CLL cells, CIP4 associates with GTP-bound Cdc42 and is recruited to the
rear of the lamellipodium and along microspikes radiating through the lamellipodium. Consistent with its cellular
distribution, CIP4 removal impairs both the assembly of the polarized lamellipodium and directional migration
along a diffusible CCL19 gradient. Furthermore, CIP4 depletion results in decreased activation of WASP, but
increased activation of PAK1 and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). Notably, p38 MAPK inhibition
results in impaired lamellipodium assembly and loss of directional migration. This suggests that CIP4 modulates
both the WASP and p38 MAPK pathways to promote lamellipodium assembly and chemotaxis. Overall, our study
reveals a critical role of CIP4 in mediating chemotaxis of CLL cells by controlling the dynamics of microspikecontaining protrusions and cell steering. Cancer Res; 73(11); 3412–24. 2013 AACR.

Introduction
There is growing evidence that the dissemination of tumor
cells is governed by a reprogramming of the molecular machinery controlling motility (1). Solid tumors with high dissemination potential have been shown to upregulate actin cytoskeleton regulators that decode chemotactic cues for the
assembly of protrusions supporting migration and invasion
(2–4). In particular, high expression of members of the WASP
family facilitates the dissemination of several cancers by
promoting the assembly of ﬁlopodia, lamellipodia, and invadopodia (5, 6). The formation of membrane protrusions
involved in migration requires a high degree of coordination
between actin cytoskeleton remodeling and induction of membrane curvature. One mechanism to achieve this coordination

is mediated by BAR domain-containing proteins, which sense
membrane curvature, mold the plasma membrane, and recruit
actin nucleators such as WASP- and formin-family proteins (7,
8). The capacity of tumor cells to harness BAR domain-containing proteins is supported by the ﬁnding that invasive breast
cancer cells overexpress the F-BAR domain-containing Cdc42interacting protein 4 (CIP4), which regulates invadopodia
formation and invasion through the extracellular matrix (9, 10).
The dissemination of hematologic malignancies is thought
to be derived from the intrinsic ability of hematopoietic cells
and in particular lymphocytes to patrol the body and migrate
between distant tissue compartments (11). However, malignant B cells assemble aberrant actin-rich protrusions endowing these cells with high migratory and invasive potential (12).
Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), which is a common
lympho-proliferative disorder of mature B lymphocytes (13),
is characterized by tumor cells highly responsive to chemotactic cues that circulate at high rate through the blood and
accumulate in the bone marrow and lymph nodes (14–18).
These aspects of the CLL phenotype may be linked to their
propensity to assemble actin-rich structures in response to
chemotactic signals, thereby altering normal leukocyte homing and homeostasis (12, 19). Accordingly, the actin regulator
HS1 is hyper-phosphorylated in patients with CLL, regulates in
vivo migration, and is associated with poor clinical outcome
(20, 21). The trafﬁcking and homing of hematopoietic cells to
the lymphatic tissues and in particular their migration across
the vascular endothelium are controlled in part by CCR7, the
receptor for the CCL19 and CCL21 chemokines (22). CCR7 level
in CLL cells correlates with lymphadenopathy (15, 23) and is

higher in ZAP-70þ/CD38þ CLL cells, whose presence is related
to a poor prognosis (24). Therefore, CLL disease progression
may correlate with the development of cells that acquire
increased potential to invade lymph nodes via the CCL19/
21-CCR7 axis.
Our objective was to investigate whether regulators of actin
cytoskeleton and membrane curvature are abnormally
expressed in CLL to promote assembly of promigratory structures in response to CCL19. We identiﬁed the F-BAR domaincontaining protein CIP4 as speciﬁcally overexpressed in CLL
when compared with normal B cells or other subtypes of B-cell
malignancies. By combining siRNA/shRNA approaches with
real-time tracking of cells migrating in CCL19 gradients, we
show that CLL cells depend on CIP4 for the assembly of a highly
structured lamellipodium and for directional migration in
response to CCL19.

tions with RNA template without reverse transcriptase were
used as negative controls. Samples were ampliﬁed with primers for each gene [for details, see quantitative PCR (qPCR)
primer list in Supplementary Table S1] and glyceraldehyde3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) as a housekeeping gene
(other housekeeping genes, including rRNA 18S and b-actin
were also tested with comparable results). The Ct values were
normalized to the GAPDH curve and the relative expression of
each gene was expressed as the ratio relative to control B cells
isolated from the blood of 3 healthy donors.

Patients and cell lines
Peripheral blood samples were collected from patients with
CLL after obtaining informed consent and approval from the
Toulouse University Medical Center Ethic Committee. After
separation by Ficoll centrifugation, cells were used freshly or
stored as frozen samples (HIMIP collection). According to the
French law, HIMIP collection has been declared to the Ministry
of Higher Education and Research (DC 2008-307 collection 1)
and obtained a transfer agreement (AC 2008-129) after approbation by the local ethical committee (Comite de Protection
des Personnes Sud-Ouest et Outremer II). Clinical and biologic
annotations of the samples have been declared to the national
committee on data processing (Comite National Informatique
et Libertes). For some experiments, B-leukemic cells were
puriﬁed by magnetic separation according to manufacturer's
instructions (Easy Sep Human B Cell Enrichment kit w/o CD43
depletion; Stem cell Technologies). Control B cells from
healthy donors were isolated from buffy coats (Etablissement
Français du Sang) using a negative selection kit (EasySep
Human B Cell Enrichment Kit; Stem Cell Technologies). B-cell
purity was assessed by ﬂow cytometry. The CLL-derived cell
lines JVM3 and MEC2 were purchased from DSMZ (n ACC18
and ACC500, respectively) authenticated by ﬂow cytometry
analysis of B-cell surface markers and tested regularly for the
absence of Mycoplasma infection.

Western blot analysis and GST pull-down
Cells were lysed with Cytobuster Protein Extraction Reagent
(Novagen) containing NaF, Na3VO4 (1 mmol/L each), and
protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma). Proteins from total cell
lysates were resolved by gel SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting. The following primary antibodies were used to
reveal the membranes: anti-CIP4 (clone 21; BD Transduction
Laboratories), anti-GAPDH (clone 374; Chemicon), anti-Cdc42
(sc-87; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-total P38 (9212; Cell
Signaling), anti-pP38 (clone 3D7; Cell Signaling), anti-pErk1/2
(E10; Cell Signaling), anti-PAK1/2/3 (2604; Cell Signaling), antipPAK1 (Ser199/204)/PAK2 (Ser192/197; 2605; Cell Signaling),
anti-WASP (H-250; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-pWASP
(phospho Y-290; Abcam), anti-FBP17 (gift from Dr. P. De
Camilli, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT;
ref. 25) and anti-Toca-1 (developed in Dr. G. Scita's laboratory).
Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies
were from Promega. Where indicated, JVM3 cells were pretreated for 10 minutes with either dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)
or 50 mmol/L IPA-3 (Sigma). Cells were then stimulated for 5
minutes with 100 ng/mL CCL19 before lysis. Recombinant
glutathione S-transferase (GST) and GST-Cdc42 were puriﬁed
from Escherichia coli and the immobilized GST-Cdc42 protein
was preloaded with GDP or GTPgS as described previously
(26). Cell lysates were prepared for GST pull-down experiments
as described earlier and incubated with 20 mg of each fusion
protein bound to glutathione-sepharose beads for 2 hours at
4 C. The beads were washed 4 times with PBST (1% Tween 20)
and boiled at 95 C for 5 minutes. Samples were subjected to
SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting with CIP4 monoclonal antibody (mAb). Active Cdc42 pull-down was conducted
as previously described (27).

Quantitative reverse transcription PCR
Total RNA was isolated from puriﬁed B cells using the TRIzol
reagent (Invitrogen). Two microgram of RNA was used, with
100 ng random hexamers, in a reverse transcription reaction
(SUPERSCRIPT II; Invitrogen). One-tenth nanogram of cDNA
was ampliﬁed, in triplicate, in a reaction volume of 25 mL with
10 pmol/L of each gene-speciﬁc primer and the SYBR-green
PCR MasterMix (Applied Biosystems). Real-time PCR was
conducted on the ABI/Prism 7700 Sequence Detector System
(PerkinElmer/Applied Biosystems), using a pre-PCR step of 10
minutes at 95 C, followed by 40 cycles of 15 seconds at 95 C
and 60 seconds at 60 C. Speciﬁcity of the ampliﬁed products
was conﬁrmed by melting curve analysis (Dissociation Curve;
PerkinElmer/Applied Biosystems) and by 6% PAGE. Prepara-

siRNA and shRNA-mediated CIP4 knockdown
Transient CIP4 knockdown was obtained by nucleofection
of JVM3 cells and patient CLL cells with 500 nmol/L CIP4speciﬁc siRNA (GGAGAAUAGUAAGCGUAAA) or scrambled
control siRNA (GGAATACGAGAGAAATGAT) purchased from
Dharmacon. Cells were nucleofected with the Amaxa system
(Amaxa Biosystems/Lonza) using Nucleofector Solution V and
Nucleofector program X-001 for JVM3 cells and U-013 for
patient CLL cells. Stable CIP4 knockdown was obtained by
transduction of JVM3 cells with MISSION lentiviral transduction particles (Sigma) encoding 2 short hairpin RNAs (shRNA)
targeting CIP4 (TRCN063186 and TRCN299602). As negative
controls, MISSION nontarget shRNA control transduction
particles (SHC002V and SHC202V) were used. Stable

knockdown cell lines were generated by selecting transduced
cells with 1 mg/mL puromycin. Silencing efﬁciency was controlled by Western blotting.
Transwell chemotaxis assay
Cells (JVM3 or puriﬁed leukemic cells from patients with
CLL) were resuspended in RPMI, 0.5% bovine serum albumin
(BSA). A total of 300 mL containing 0.5  105 patient cells or
0.1  105 JVM3 cells was loaded on the top chamber of a
Transwell culture PET (polyethylene terephtalate) membrane
insert (BD Falcon) with a pore size of 3 mm. Filters were
transferred into wells containing 1,000 mL RPMI, 0.5% BSA
with varying concentrations of CCL19 (Peprotech). Transwell
plates were incubated at 37 C in 5% CO2 for 6 hours for patient
cells and overnight for JVM3 cells. Inserts were then removed
and cells that transmigrated in the lower wells were resuspended in 250 mL ﬂuorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)
buffer plus 50 mL calibration beads (BD Biosciences). The same
number of beads was acquired for each sample and cells were
counted using a FACSCalibur ﬂow cytometer (BD Biosciences).
The migration index was calculated as the number of cells
transmigrating toward CCL19 divided by the number of cells
transmigrating spontaneously in the absence of CCL19.
Real-time chemotaxis
Chemotaxis of JVM3 cells was analyzed in real-time using 2dimensional (2D) chemotaxis m-slides coated with Collagen IV
(Ibidi). Cells (0.3  106 cells in 10 mL) were loaded into the
central transversal chamber and incubated at 37 C for 50
minutes to allow cell attachment. Fresh RPMI was loaded into
adjacent reservoirs and a CCL19 gradient was created following the manufacturer's instructions. Cell migration was
recorded at 37 C, 5% CO2 by taking a picture every 2 minutes
using an inverted wide-ﬁeld microscope (Zeiss Axiovert) with a
2.5 objective and MetaMorph32 software. Images were analyzed with the ImageJ 1.42q software (W.S. Rasband, National
Institute of Health, Bethesda, MD), using the Manual Tracking
plugin (F. Cordelieres, Institut Curie, Orsay, France). Chemotaxis plots and migration parameters were obtained with the
Chemotaxis and Migration tool from Ibidi.
Confocal laser scanning microscopy
To visualize and measure lamellipodium formation, JVM3
cells or primary CLL cells were seeded for 5 minutes on glass
slides precoated with 4 mg/mL ICAM-1, in the presence of 100
ng/mL soluble CCL19. Cells were ﬁxed with 3% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized in 3% BSA/0.1% saponin, and stained in
3% BSA/0.1% saponin with either anti-a-tubulin rabbit pAb
(Abcam) followed by goat anti-rabbit mAb labeled with Alexa
Fluor 488 or phalloidin labeled with Alexa Fluor 633. They were
additionally stained with 40 ,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole
(DAPI) before mounting. Pictures of individual JVM3 cells
collected with a 63 objective mounted on a Confocal Zeiss
710 microscope were analyzed on ImageJ by delineating manually the borders of the lamellipodium to calculate its surface.
To investigate the effect of p38 inhibition on CCL19-induced
lamellipodium assembly, lamellipodium surface was measured
as above in JVM3 cells that were treated for 1 hour with 10

mmol/L SB203580 (Calbiochem) or DMSO, before CCL19 exposure. To study the subcellular localization of CIP4 and Cdc42,
JVM3 cells activated for 5 minutes with immobilized ICAM-1
and soluble CCL19 were ﬁxed, permeabilized (as above), and
stained with anti-Cdc42 rabbit pAb (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and anti-CIP4 mAb (clone 21; BD Transduction Laboratories), followed by goat anti-rabbit mAb labeled with Alexa Fluor
488 and goat anti-mouse mAb labeled with Alexa Fluor 546.
The relative localization of Cdc42 and CIP4 was analyzed using
the Linescan function of ImageJ. To study the subcellular
localization of CIP4 in migrating cells, 3  106 JVM3 cells were
transiently nucleofected with 1 to 3 mg of a plasmid encoding
GFP–CIP430. After 24 hours, dead cells were removed using a
Dead Cell Removal Kit (Miltenyi). For time-lapse video recording, cells were placed in Ibidi chemotaxis chambers and a
Confocal Zeiss 710 microscope was used to track cells every 8
seconds using a 63 objective.

Results
CIP4 is expressed at high levels in CLL cell lines and is
required for chemotaxis toward CCL19
Given the involvement of WASP-family proteins in the
regulation of tumor cell migration, expression of a selected
set of WASP-family proteins (WASP, N-WASP, and WAVE1-3)
and direct interactors (WIP, FBP17, and Toca-1, CIP4) was
analyzed by quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR)
in the JVM3 and MEC2 CLL cell lines. Levels of mRNA in the
CLL cell lines were normalized to those measured in normal
peripheral blood B cells. This analysis revealed that the mRNA
encoding the F-BAR domain-containing CIP4 was expressed at
elevated levels in both CLL cell lines (Fig. 1A). The other mRNA
analyzed in the CLL cell lines was either mildly overexpressed
(WASP, WIP, WAVE1-2, and FBP17), expressed at levels comparable with those of control B cells (N-WASP, Toca-1), or
undetected (WAVE3). Accordingly, the CIP4 protein was also
overexpressed in JVM3 and MEC2 when compared with normal peripheral blood B cells (Fig. 1B). CIP4 overexpression
seemed to be restricted to the CLL cell lines as CIP4 expression
in cell lines corresponding to different B-cell malignancies was
comparable or even lower to that in normal B cells (Fig. 1B).
Further analysis of the levels of the CIP4-related proteins Toca1 and FBP17 showed that CIP4 overexpression is a speciﬁc
feature of this protein as there no concomitant increase nor
compensation by the other members of the CIP4 family, Toca-1
and FBP17 (Fig. 1B). Because of its high expression in CLL cell
lines and its membrane–actin interface regulatory role, we
formulated the hypothesis that CIP4 might regulate CLL cell
migration. The contribution of CIP4 to CLL cell migration was
tested by knocking down CIP4 expression in JVM3 cells and
measuring the ability of those cells to migrate toward CCL19.
Nucleofection with CIP4 siRNA efﬁciently and reproducibly
depleted JVM3 cells in CIP4 (Fig. 1C). Transwell assays showed
that the migration of cells knocked down for CIP4 toward a
CCL19 gradient was signiﬁcantly reduced (Fig. 1D). To test
whether this decrease in chemotactic response could be the
result of either defective motility or defective orientation
within the chemokine gradient, single cell tracks were recorded
in Ibidi chemotaxis m-slides. Most CIP4-expressing JVM3 cells

Figure 1. CIP4 is overexpressed in CLL cell lines and regulates the directed migration of JVM3 cells within a CCL19 gradient. A, gene expression levels of
9 selected regulators of actin cytoskeleton and membrane remodeling were measured by qRT-PCR. RNA was isolated from 2 CLL-derived lines (JVM3
and MEC2). To normalize the relative gene expression levels, a value of 1 was attributed to the expression levels of normal peripheral blood B cells (n ¼ 3).
B, Western blot analysis of CIP4, Toca-1, and FBP17 in normal peripheral blood B cells and in cell lines, models of CLL (JVM3 and MEC2), follicular

not exposed to any CCL19 gradient (Fig. 1E). Measurement of

(Fig. 1F). In contrast, CIP4 knocked down cells displayed no
forward migration, supporting the ﬁnding that cells lacking
CIP4 displayed a random migration pattern (Fig. 1F). CIP4
knocked down cells remained motile both in basal conditions
and in response to CCL19, with migration speed comparable

cells. We tested this possibility by comparing the morphologies
of JVM3 cells depleted or not for CIP4. Independently of CIP4
expression, JVM3 cells plated on ICAM-1 displayed various
morphologies and emitted numerous types of membrane
protrusions. A hallmark of CCL19 stimulation in CIP4-expressing JVM3 cells was the assembly of a lamellipodium, which
consisted of a wide ﬂat protrusion made of a veil embedded
with microspikes. This structure was observed both in ﬁxed
cells following short exposure to ICAM-1 plus CCL19 (Fig. 2A)
and in live cells exposed to a CCL19 gradient (Supplementary
Fig. S2A). Real-time imaging revealed that this lamellipodium
is a dynamic structure leading the cells toward the source of
CCL19 (Supplementary Movie S1). At the opposite side of the
lamellipodium, JVM3 cells emitted a thinner protrusion resembling a uropod. Furthermore, the microtubule organizing
center (MTOC) was usually localized along the lamellipodium–uropod axis, mostly between the lamellipodium and
the nucleus. In contrast, cells depleted for CIP4 (Fig. 2B) failed

with that of scrambled siRNA-treated cells (Fig. 1F). Therefore,
those results show that CIP4 is dispensable for JVM3 cell
motility, but is required for CCL19-evoked cell steering and
chemotaxis.
CIP4 is required for CCL19-driven lamellipodium
assembly in JVM3 cells
Because the best-characterized function of CIP4 is to regulate receptor endocytosis, the abrogation of chemotaxis
consecutive to CIP4 knockdown might be linked to an abnormal control of CCL19-induced CCR7 internalization. However,
JVM3 cells depleted for CIP4 by shRNA-encoding lentiviral
vectors expressed normal basal levels of surface CCR7, which
was equally internalized in CIP4 knocked down and control
cells (Supplementary Fig. S1). This result indicates that CIP4
control of CCL19-driven chemotaxis does not result from
altered CCR7 endocytosis. Through its F-BAR domain, CIP4
might also associate to membrane protrusions in migrating

CIP4 Regulates Lamellipodium Assembly

to assemble a polarized lamellipodium upon CCL19 exposure
and lost the MTOC axial positioning. These cells formed
multiple ﬁlopodia and ﬂat protrusions devoid of microspikes,
which extended in different directions (Fig. 2A). The morphologic alteration induced by CIP4 depletion was further documented by a loss in lamellipodium surface in CCL19-stimulated JVM3 cells (Fig. 2C). The role of CIP4 in controlling JVM3
cell lamellipodium assembly was conﬁrmed in live cells
exposed to a CCL19 gradient. Most cells treated with a CIP4
siRNA failed to assemble the microspike-containing lamellipodia predominantly observed in control cells (Supplementary
Fig. S2A). This failure was associated with frequent changes in
directions of migration and reduced directional persistence
(Supplementary Fig. S2B). As observed by time-lapse video
recording, instead of assembling a lamellipodium, CIP4
knocked down JVM3 cells emitted transiently and sequentially
multiple types of protrusions (Supplementary Movie S2). In
agreement with the observation in ﬁxed cells, these cells
emitted ﬂat protrusions and short ﬁlopodia, as well as narrow
lamellipodia containing 1 to 2 microspikes only, or blebs
(Supplementary Fig. S2C). Clearly, these cells failed to orientate
along the chemokine gradient (Supplementary Fig. S2D). Taken together, these ﬁndings show that CIP4 is crucial for the
polarized assembly of the lamellipodium in response to CCL19
in JVM3 cells.
CIP4 dynamically distributes to the lamellipodium
To further investigate the mechanism by which CIP4 controls lamellipodium dynamics, JVM3 cells expressing a CIP4–
GFP fusion protein were observed by time-lapse microscopy
during directional migration toward CCL19. JVM3 cells placed
in media without chemokine were either round or displayed
narrow cytoplasmic extensions emitting short ﬁlopodia. These
cells displayed a cytoplasmic distribution of CIP4 with local
enrichment in discrete patches (Fig. 3A). Exposure to a CCL19
gradient led to lamellipodium assembly and to the polarization
of CIP4 toward the lamellipodium rear and along microspikes
(Fig. 3B and Supplementary Movie S3). GFP–CIP4 intensity
proﬁle along microspikes revealed that CIP4 was enriched
either at the rear of microspikes or along these structures
(Fig. 3C–E). Parallel analysis of GFP–actin and GFP–CCR7 in
migrating JVM3 cells indicated that microspikes were enriched
in actin and contained CCR7 (Supplementary Movies S4 and
S5). Higher magniﬁcation examination showed that the microspikes extended in length up to 6 mm from the lamella until the
tip of the lamellipodium and harbored pendular movements at
an angular speed of 1 to 6.5 rad/s. Notably, CIP4 accumulated
along microspikes as they converged and fused, an event that
was associated with microspike shortening and retraction (Fig.
3F and Supplementary Movies S6–S8). The study of CIP4
localization during microspike dynamics revealed that coincidently with microspike contact (interdistance < 2 mm), CIP4
was recruited at the rear and then along the contacting
microspikes. As the microspikes started to retract (within
0–30 seconds following maximal CIP4 accumulation), CIP4
intensity decreased in a parallel manner (Fig. 3G–I and Supplementary Movies S6–S8). The dynamic patterns of CIP4
distribution suggest that this molecule is associated with the

www.aacrjournals.org

assembly of lamellipodia and with the turnover of radial
microspikes.
CCL19-driven activation of Cdc42, WASP, and MAPK in
CIP4-depleted JVM3 cells
CIP4 was originally described as an effector of Cdc42 (28), a
Rho GTPase that plays a key role in polarized migration (28, 29).
We therefore analyzed whether CIP4 interacted with Cdc42 in
JVM3 cells and whether CIP4 depletion might affect Cdc42
activation in these cells. To test directly whether active Cdc42
and CIP4 interacted in JVM3 cells exposed to CCL19, cell
lysates were subjected to pull-down experiments with
Cdc42-coated beads. Active GST-Cdc42 (GTP form) bound
CIP4 very efﬁciently, whereas no binding was detected with
either inactive GST-Cdc42 (GDP form) or GST alone, indicating
that CIP4 interacted with active Cdc42 in our model (Fig. 4A).
The association of CIP4 to Cdc42 in our model raised the
possibility that CIP4 might inﬂuence Cdc42 activation or
stability. However, CIP4-depleted JVM3 cells displayed both
normal total Cdc42 levels and normal CCL19-evoked Cdc42
activation (Fig. 4B). Next, we tested whether CIP4, as a bona ﬁde
effector of Cdc42 (28), was required to mediate signaling
downstream of this GTPase. Most notably, biochemical reconstitution experiments showed that TOCA-1, and presumably
also CIP4 and FBP17, were critical to promote optimal activation of the otherwise inhibited actin nucleation-promoting
factors WASP and N-WASP (30). Hence, we tested the activation status of WASP, which is speciﬁc of the hematopoietic
system. Loss of CIP4 signiﬁcantly impaired WASP activation in
response to CCL19 stimulation as indicated by its tyrosine
phosphorylation status (Fig. 4C; ref. 31), suggesting that one
mechanism underlying protrusion deﬁciency consecutive to
CIP4 knockdown might be impaired WASP activation and
subsequent WASP-dependent actin polymerization. The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) p38 and Erk1/2 are
additional, important regulators of cell migration (32) and
have been shown to act downstream of Cdc42 (33). We ﬁrst
assessed the involvement of the p38 pathway on chemotaxis of
primary CLL cells by using the p38 pharmacologic inhibitor
SB203580. Leukemic cells isolated from the blood of a patient
with CLL displayed a reduced migration toward CCL19 upon
SB203580 treatment (Fig. 4D). We then investigated whether
CIP4 depletion had an impact on p38 and Erk1/2 phosphorylation. As expected from the reported constitutive expression
of phosphorylated p38 in CLL (34), nonstimulated control
JMV3 cells displayed a high p38 phosphorylation status. Interestingly, in these cells, CCL19 treatment did not modify p38
phosphorylation. CIP4-depleted JMV3 cells also displayed a
high basal phosphorylation of p38, which, however, displayed a
2-fold increase upon CCL19 treatment (Fig. 4E and F). p38
phosphorylation has been linked to the activation PAK1, a
known effector of Cdc42 (35). Therefore, we assessed PAK1
phosphorylation status in control and CIP4-depleted JMV3
cells. Group 1 PAKs (PAK1/2/3) were not activated in nonstimulated cells and were activated upon CCL19 treatment
(Fig. 4E). As observed for p38, depletion of CIP4 in JMV3 cells
markedly increased PAK1 phosphorylation as compared with
control cells. To evaluate the role of PAK in p38 activation

that PAK is responsible for p38 phosphorylation in CLL19stimulated JVM3 cells. IPA-3 treatment also inhibited Erk
activation in control and CIP4-depleted JMV3 cells suggesting
that PAK is also regulating Erk activation in this model.
Altogether, these data suggest that in our CLL model, CIP4
regulates CCL19-directed cell migration by modulating the
activation of WASP and PAK/p38 as central motility-related
pathways.
p38 and CIP4 are present within lamellipodia and
control their formation
Given the recent identiﬁcation of p38 as a major driver of
chemotaxis in neutrophils (36), we addressed whether the
p38 pathway might cooperate with CIP4 in the control of
lamellipodium assembly in CLL cells. We ﬁrst studied the
localization of p38 and CIP4 in cells emitting CCL19-evoked
lamellipodia. As shown in previous ﬁgures, JVM3 cells plated
on ICAM-1 and stimulated with CCL19 formed lamellipodia
(Fig. 5A). CIP4 displayed a punctuate distribution, reminiscent of intracellular vesicles. CIP4 was particularly enriched
in large patches at the rear of the lamellipodium. CIP4 was
also detected within the lamellipodium itself, albeit at lower

levels. The distribution of phospho-p38 within the cell body
differed from that of CIP4 and was mainly nuclear, as
revealed by the DAPI staining. Differently from CIP4, phospho-p38 could not be detected at the rear of the lamellipodium. However, phospho-p38 was detected within the lamellipodium extension. Along a cross-section of the lamellipodium, CIP4 and phospho-p38 displayed parallel intensity
proﬁles, suggesting that this structure might be a site
favoring interaction between these 2 molecules (Fig. 5B).
The parallel distribution of CIP4 and p38 over the breath of
the lamellipodium extension was further strengthened by a
relatively high Pearson's coefﬁcient, which applied both for
phospho-p38 and total p38 stainings, when calculated for the
whole lamellipodium area (Fig. 5C). We then tested whether
p38 might control lamellipodium formation in JVM3 cells.
Blockade of the p38 pathway with the speciﬁc p38 inhibitor
SB203580 inhibited lamellipodia extension in control, but
not in JVM3 CIP4-depleted JVM3 cells (Fig. 5D). Taken
together, our data establish a link between CIP4 and p38
as both molecules are colocalized to the lamellipodium and
as they are both necessary to the assembly of this structure
promoting directional migration.

CIP4 is highly expressed in primary CLL leukemic cells
and regulates CCL19-driven chemotaxis
To investigate the physiopathologic relevance of our ﬁndings, the expression of CIP4 and its contribution to CCL19driven migration were investigated in primary leukemic cells
isolated from the peripheral blood of patients with CLL. As
shown by the Western blot analysis conducted on a representative patient series, CIP4 was expressed in a majority of
samples at higher levels than in control B cells (Fig. 6A).
Further analysis of samples from a total of 43 patients with
CLL and densitometric quantiﬁcation indicated that CIP4 was
expressed in primary CCL cells in an average of 2.5-fold over
the levels of control B cells (range, 0.85–5.45). This analysis
reinforced the notion that CLL is associated to high CIP4
expression. The analysis of CIP4 localization in primary CLL
cells stimulated by ICAM-1/CCL19 showed that CIP4 was
associated to actin-rich protrusions, including lamellipodia
(Fig. 6B), thereby conﬁrming our ﬁndings from JVM3 cells.
To further explore the role of CIP4 in primary CLL cells, its
expression was knocked down by siRNA in samples collected
from 3 patients (Fig. 6C). CIP4 siRNA-treated leukemic cells
from patients 10 and 15 displayed a reduced migration when
compared with the corresponding control cells treated
with scrambled siRNA. In contrast, the leukemic cells from

patient 22, in which levels of CIP4 remained high upon CIP4
siRNA treatment, retained their ability to migrate efﬁciently
toward the CCL19 gradient, reinforcing the idea that CLL
cell chemotaxis toward CCL19 is dependent on the presence
of a high CIP4 level (Fig. 6C). Given the relative variability of
CIP4 expression in primary CLL cells, we investigated
whether CIP4 expression levels may correlate with known
disease markers by subdividing the 43 patients analyzed into
CIP4-high (>2.5-fold increase over control B cells) and CIP4low (<2.5-fold increase over control B cells) groups of
comparable size. As reported in Table 1, CIP4-high patients
seemed to be biased toward the IgVH-unmutated status,
which is associated to an aggressive form of the disease and
to a shortened survival (37, 38). Further studies will be
necessary to consolidate this association and to investigate
how the molecule CIP4 identiﬁed here as a key regulator of
CLL cell directed migration might be involved in the pathogenesis of the disease.

Discussion
This study provides novel molecular insights into the regulation of the high migratory potency of CLL leukemic cells.

gradient revealed that these cells assemble a polarized, particularly large and dynamic actin microspike-containing lamellipodium. More importantly, the assembly and turnover of this
protrusive structure that drives the cells toward the source of
CCL19 is dependent on CIP4, a F-BAR domain protein known
to regulate endocytosis by sensing and modifying membrane
curvature (25, 39, 40).
The lamellipodium of CLL cells seems as a broad veil
bearing radially arranged microspikes that contain actin
bundles. To our knowledge, these structures have never
been reported in leukocytes. In addition, very little is
known on the dynamics of lamellipodium-associated microspikes as their early description in ﬁbroblasts (41). In CLL
leukemic cells, microspike formation and dynamics are
dependent on chemokine exposure, suggesting that these
structures are involved in chemokine gradient sensing.
This possibility is further reinforced by the observation
that CCR7 is present along these structures. CIP4-depleted
cells display multiple, short-lived, and variably oriented

protrusions largely devoid of microspikes. As a consequence
of these alterations, cells lose polarity and chemotactic
ability. Notably, CIP4 is dynamically and transiently
enriched at the rear of microspikes just before these structures fuse and disassemble, highlighting a novel role for
CIP4 in regulating microspike turnover in highly migrating
tumoral cells.
CIP4 has been shown to control endocytosis of numerous
receptors, including receptors triggering cell migration (42).
However, in our model CCR7 internalization and cell surface
expression are not affected by removal of CIP4, suggesting
that its endocytic function might not account for its control
over polarized lamellipodia extension, microspike dynamics,
and chemotactic cell migration. In the context of prenatal
neuronal development, CIP4 has recently been discovered to
negatively regulate neurite outgrowth by inducing lamellipodia and veil-like protrusions rich in actin bundles (43).
Notably, CIP4 activity in developing neurons was also independent from its role in endocytosis. CIP4 function, instead,

was restricted to the migratory and developmental phase of
neuronal cells, and controlled the emission of neuronal
protrusion along neurites and axons. Remarkably, this functional role was attributed to the ability of CIP4 to mediate
large and extended lamellipodia, a ﬁnding similar to what we
report in this study in a dramatically different cellular
context. Collectively, these results support the notion that
one major role of CIP4 is to regulate the dynamics of
lamellipodia protrusions, further impacting on cell motility,
a central function that might have been highjacked by
tumoral cells to promote spreading.
A still unanswered question remains: how does CIP4 promote the membrane and actin dynamics underlying the assembly of the microspike-bearing lamellipodium? Because of their
concave membrane-bending activity, F-BAR proteins are usually associated to the regulation of endocytosis. However, some
F-BAR proteins including CIP4 have also been associated to the
promotion of membrane protrusions such as ﬁlopodia and
invadopodia (9, 28, 44, 45). Given that microspikes of migrating
CLL cells contain actin bundles, it is very likely that additional
molecular partners involved in actin polymerization are working together with CIP4. In keeping with this notion, we show
that CCL19 stimulates Cdc42 activation and relocalization to
the rear of the lamellipodium together with CIP4. CIP4 and
Cdc42, in turn, have been shown to interact with WASP/WAVE
proteins thereby promoting actin nucleation and ﬁlament
elongation (7, 9, 46–48). In this context, it is worth noting that
Cdc42 is primarily implicated in microspike/ﬁlopodia formation, rather than directly in the extension of lamellipodia.
However, in several cell types, ﬁlopodia and sheet-like lamellipodia rapidly interchange during protrusive activity. On one
hand, ﬁlopodia are embedded into or arise from preexisting
lamellipodia (49). On the other hand, ﬁlopodia may become
anchoring sites from where lamellipodial veils ﬁrst form. This

latter notion is consistent with our observations and recent
data in neurons (43), showing that CIP4 controls microspike
dynamics, favoring the assembly of veil-like structures.
Our study highlights a further level of molecular control of
lamellipodium assembly in CLL cells by linking for the ﬁrst
time CIP4 to PAK1 and p38 MAPK activation. Our observations
strengthen the notion that p38, a known regulator of stress
responses, also regulates directed migration (32). Interestingly,
p38 MAPK has been shown to be constitutively active in CLL,
where it regulates MMP-9 production, suggesting a role in
invasion (34). We report here that p38 activation is further
increased upon CLL19 exposure in CIP4-depleted CLL cells,
suggesting that control of its activation is important in regulating migration. In agreement with our data, it has been
reported that over-activation of PAK1 compromised the maintenance of cell polarity in the migrating mesendoderm during
Xenopus gastrulation (50). Similarly to CIP4 knockdown, p38
inhibition prevents lamellipodium assembly, an effect that is
not additive with CIP4 depletion. The fact that both p38 hyperactivation or inhibition are detrimental to lamellipodium
assembly suggests that a balanced p38 activity is required for
this process. It therefore indicates that the modulation by CIP4
levels and subsequent PAK activation downstream of Cdc42
can be key regulators of directed migration. Future work will
elucidate the mechanism of CIP4 and p38 MAPK collaboration
in CLL cells.
Our data also suggest that high CIP4 expression is a
hallmark of tumoral CLL cells and is associated to the high
chemotactic activity of these cells. Breast cancer cell lines
also express high levels of CIP4, which regulates invasiveness
(9, 10). Very recently, CIP4 expression has also been associated to the invasiveness of osteosarcoma (51). Together,
these ﬁndings suggest that the tight regulation of CIP4
expression observed during neuronal development might
be lost in some tumors, thereby participating to the transformation process. Consistent with this notion, we show that
primary leukemic cells from patients with CLL display high
expression of CIP4, which is required for CCL19-driven
chemotaxis. Analysis of CIP4 protein expression in resting
and activated normal B cells and various subtypes of B-cell
malignancies suggests that high CIP4 expression may be
speciﬁc for CLL leukemic cells within the B-cell lineage. In
the cohort of 43 patients with CLL analyzed in this study, we
noted a bias toward an IgVH-unmutated status in the
patient group with the highest CIP4 expression. Further
studies on larger cohorts will be necessary to conﬁrm that
CIP4-high expression is linked to disease severity. It remains
also to be clariﬁed how CIP4 expression and its control over
directed cell migration is participating to CLL pathogenesis.
Importantly, our data indicate that lowering CIP4 expression
to levels comparable with those of normal B cells can impair
the chemotactic ability of leukemic cells from patients with
CLL. This observation raises the possibility that CLL cells
become addicted to CIP4 to migrate toward CCL19. Along
that view, CIP4 may have an important therapeutic value
and could be considered a molecular target of pharmacologic inactivation to block CLL cells dissemination to lymph
nodes, a strategy already pursued with the use of anti-CCR7

antibodies (52). CLL clinical spectrum is wide, ranging from
mild lymphocytosis to lymph node enlargement and multiorgan failure. Disease progression may be related to the
development of cells acquiring an exacerbated potential to
enter and invade lymph nodes via the CCL19/21-CCR7 axis.
This is supported by the increased CCR7 expression and
CCR7-dependent migration reported in ZAP-70þ/CD38þ
CLL cells, whose presence is related to a bad prognosis
(24, 53). In that context, further studies will be required to
elucidate how disease progression may be related to the
CIP4-driven chemotactic activity characterized here.
