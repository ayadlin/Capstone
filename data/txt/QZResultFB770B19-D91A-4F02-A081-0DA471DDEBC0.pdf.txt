in the pathogenesis of MM (4, 5). Aberrant methylation (referred to
as methylation) of gene promoter regions leading to gene silencing
is to date the most widely studied epigenetic abnormality in human
malignancies (6). Costello et al. (7) reported that, on average,
600 CpG islands are targets for methylation in malignant diseases.
To date, f20 cancer-related genes have been identified that are
frequently silenced by methylation in MM (5, 8, 9). Thus, identification of unknown epigenetically inactivated cancer-related genes
in MM is of tremendous importance for a better understanding of
the pathogenesis of this disease. In addition to DNA methylation,
histone hypoacetylation plays a critical role in epigenetic gene
silencing (10). Chromatin inactivated by histone H3 and/or H4
deacetylation is associated with silencing of several cancer-related
genes in cancer cells (11–13).
In contrast to genetic alterations, epigenetic changes are
potentially reversible. DNA methyltransferase inhibitors 5-azacytidine and 5-aza-2¶-deoxycytidine (Aza-dC) are analogues of
deoxycytidine, which is the target nucleoside for methylation;
these drugs have been extensively studied in reactivating by
methylation-silenced genes (6, 14). Trichostatin A (TSA) is a
potent histone deacetylase inhibitor. Moreover, Xiong et al. (15)
reported that besides HDAC activity, TSA has DNMT3b downregulating properties, and several studies have shown that TSA is
capable of activating the expression of methylation-silenced genes
(16–18) and of genes that are silenced by aberrant histone
deacetylation in the absence of DNA methylation (19). Aza-dC
and TSA have been shown to act synergistically in the
reexpression of methylated cancer-related genes (16). In addition,
several studies have shown that Aza-dC and TSA inhibit cancer
cell growth (20–22).
Here, we describe the results of a microarray-based genome-wide
screen for genes responding to DNA methyltransferase inhibition
and HDAC inhibition in MM cell lines. Our study presents a large
number of genes whose epigenetic silencing in MM was unknown
thus far. Based on the results of our microarray assay, we selected
several cancer-related genes whose epigenetic silencing in monoclonal gammopathies has been unknown thus far and analyzed
their methylation status in a large number of monoclonal
gammopathies of undetermined significance (MGUS) and MM
samples. Moreover, the methylation results were compared with
certain clinicopathologic variables of the patients. Some of them
may be of clinical relevance for MM patients.

Abstract
To identify epigenetically silenced cancer-related genes and
to determine molecular effects of 5-aza-2¶-deoxycytidine (AzadC) and/or trichostatin A (TSA) in multiple myeloma (MM),
we analyzed global changes in gene expression profiles of
three MM cell lines by microarray analysis. We identified
up-regulation of several genes whose epigenetic silencing in
MM is well known. However, much more importantly, we
identified a large number of epigenetically inactivated cancerrelated genes that are involved in various physiologic
processes and whose epigenetic regulation in MM was
unknown thus far. In addition, drug treatment of MM cell
lines resulted in down-regulation of several MM proliferationassociated factors (i.e., MAF, CCND1/2, MYC, FGFR3, MMSET).
Ten Aza-dC and/or TSA up-regulated genes (CPEB1, CD9, GJA1,
BCL7c, GADD45G, AKAP12, TFPI2, CCNA1, SPARC, and BNIP3)
were selected for methylation analysis in six MM cell lines,
24 samples from patients with monoclonal gammopathy of
undetermined significance (MGUS), and 111 samples from
patients with MM. Methylation frequencies of these genes
ranged between 0% and 17% in MGUS samples and between
5% and 50% in MM samples. Interestingly, methylation of
SPARC and BNIP3 was statistically significantly associated
with a poor overall survival of MM patients (P = 0.003 and
P = 0.017, respectively). Moreover, SPARC methylation was
associated with loss of SPARC protein expression by immunostaining in a subset of MM patients. In conclusion, we
identified new targets for aberrant methylation in monoclonal
gammopathies, and our results suggest that DNA methyltransferase and histone deacetylase inhibition might play an
important role in the future treatment of patients with MM.

Introduction
Previous molecular studies have shown that multiple myeloma
(MM) cells from the majority of patients harbor cytogenetic
aberrations, particularly illegitimate rearrangements of the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene (IGH) on 14q32, monosomy 13, and
deletions of 13q (1–3). In addition to genetic aberrations, there is
increasing evidence that epigenetic changes play an important role

Clinical specimens. Bone marrow aspirates and clinical data were
collected from 24 patients with MGUS and from 111 patients with MM as
reported recently (5). For control experiments, bone marrow specimens
from a healthy bone marrow donor and from nine patients with localized
non–Hodgkin’s lymphoma without bone marrow infiltration were analyzed.

dehydrogenase (LDH), hemoglobin, serum creatinine and calcium levels,
type of paraprotein, type of light chain, tumor stage, tumor grade, and
deletion of chromosome 13q14. Statistical analysis was performed using m2
test and Fisher’s exact test for differences between groups and t tests
between means. Overall survival was calculated using Kaplan-Meier log
rank testing.

Mononuclear cells were isolated using Histopaque-1077 (Sigma) according
to the manufacturer’s instructions and stored at 80jC.
Cell culture and treatment. The human MM cell lines MM1, U266, and
NCI-H929 were grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum. Cells (2  105/mL) were treated either with 0.5 Amol/L Aza-dC for
7 days or with 100 ng/mL TSA for 24 h or with the combination of 0.5 Amol/L
Aza-dC for 7 days and 100 ng/mL TSA for additional 24 h. Control cells
received no drug treatment.
RNA extraction and cRNA preparation. Total cellular RNA was
isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s
instruction. First- and second-strand cDNA synthesis was performed using
SuperScript double-stranded cDNA synthesis kit (Invitrogen) and 10 Ag of
purified RNA according to the manufacturer’s protocol with the use of an
oligo-dT primer containing a T7 RNA polymerase promoter site. IVT
was performed using the BioArray High Yield RNA Transcript Labeling kit
(Enzo Life Sciences). Fifteen micrograms of cRNA were fragmented at 94jC
for 35 min in a fragmentation buffer (Affymetrix).
Array hybridization and scanning. The microarray assay was carried
out using the Affymetrix GeneChip HG-U133A. The hybridization, scanning,
washing, and staining procedure was performed as recommended by the
manufacturer. The readings from the quantitative scanning were analyzed
by the Affymetrix Gene Expression Analysis Software. Hybridization quality
control variables were attended according to Affymetrix guidelines for
efficient hybridization. All microarray analyses were done in duplicates
starting from the same independently treated cell population.
Statistical analysis of microarray data. Affymetrix Microarray Analysis
Suite version 5 (MAS5) was used to process the scanned chip images and to
generate a cell intensity file for each chip. Statistical analysis was performed
using Bioconductor’s affy package.6 The significance of changes in the
expression level of each gene was evaluated with the CyberT algorithm.7
Differentially expressed genes between treated and untreated groups were
selected using following criteria: (a) results derived from drug-treated cells
had to be at least 4-fold higher than those derived from control cells in each
pairwise comparison; (b) differences in gene expression between drugtreated and control cells had to be statistically significant (P < 0.001); and
(c) the detection call had to be present (P) in minimum 1 sample.
Gene Ontology analysis. To classify up-regulated genes into statistically
significant overrepresented functional categories Gene Ontology analysis
was performed using GoMiner (23) comparing the total set of genes
represented on the HG-U133A GeneChip and the subset of genes that was
up-regulated after drug treatment.
Real-time reverse transcription-PCR. For validation of microarray
results, real-time reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) was performed using
Taqman Gene Expression Assays (Applied Biosystems) as recommended by
the manufacturer.
Nucleic acid isolation and methylation-specific PCR. Genomic DNA
was isolated from MM cell lines and from mononuclear cells by digestion
with Proteinase K, followed by standard phenol-chloroform extraction and
ethanol precipitation (24). One microgram of genomic DNA was modified
by treatment with sodium bisulfite as reported previously (25). Using
methylation-specific PCR (MSP) analysis, the methylation status of the
genes CPEB1, CD9, GJA1, BCL7c, GADD45G, AKAP12, TFPI2, CCNA1, SPARC,
and BNIP3 was analyzed. Primer sequences and PCR conditions of these
genes are available upon request.
Immunostaining. Paraffin-embedded bone marrow biopsies were cut in
5-Am-thick sections, dewaxed, and immunostained for SPARC using rabbit
anti-SPARC polyclonal antibody at a 1:1,000 dilution (Abcam). Labeling was
detected with the Envision Plus Detection Kit (DAKO) as recommended by
the manufacturer, and all sections were counterstained with hematoxylin.
Statistical analysis of methylation results. The methylation status of
the genes CPEB1, CD9, GJA1, BCL7c, GADD45G, AKAP12, TFPI2, CCNA1,
SPARC, and BNIP3 was compared with certain clinicopathologic characteristics from the MM patients including age, gender, h2-microglobulin, lactate

Results
Analysis of Global Gene Expression Pattern of MM
Cell Lines after Drug Treatment
Using the DNA microarray technique, we analyzed global
changes in gene expression after treatment of three MM cell lines
(MM1, U266, and NCI-H929) with Aza-dC, TSA, and a combination
of Aza-dC and TSA. The gene expression profile was compared
before and after treatment using Affymetrix HG-U133A GeneChip,
which contains 22,283 probe sets. Replicate array analysis using
RNA from independently treated cell lines revealed a mean
correlation coefficient of 0.96 (range 0.93–0.98), indicating high
comparability between the arrays.
Identification of genes induced by Aza-dC in MM cell lines.
Aza-dC treatment resulted in up-regulation of 92 probe sets
(0.4% of 22,283 transcripts analyzed) in the cell line MM1, 65 probe
sets (0.2%) in U266, and 220 probe sets (0.9%) in NCI-H929,
respectively. The level of induced expression varied from 4.2-fold to
a maximum of 147.03-fold in MM1, from 5.04-fold to 131.42-fold in
U266 and from 4.28-fold to 137.32-fold in NCI-H929 Aza-dC–treated
cells compared with untreated cells. As multiple probe sets for the
same gene are present on Affymetrix microarrays, up-regulated
probe sets represent 78 unique genes in the case of MM1, 60 unique
genes in the case of U266 and 194 unique genes in case of NCIH929. Overall, 284 unique genes were up-regulated in at least one of
the three MM cell lines after exposure to Aza-dC (Supplementary
Table S1). ENSEMBL database was used to obtain the genomic
sequence, including 5¶ region, exons and introns of each of the 284
up-regulated genes. The MethPrimer program (26) and the CpG
Island Searcher (27) were used to determine whether the sequences
contain CpG islands. The data showed that 73% of up-regulated
genes contained CpG islands within the analyzed regions.
Identification of genes induced by TSA in MM cell lines. We
also determined the gene expression profile of the three MM cell
lines after exposure to the HDAC inhibitor TSA. TSA treatment
resulted in up-regulation of 87 probe sets (0.4% of 22,283
transcripts analyzed) in the cell line MM1, 174 probe sets (0.8%)
in U266, and 195 probe sets (0.9%) in NCI-H929, respectively. The
level of induced expression varied from 4.39-fold to a maximum of
52.38-fold in MM1, from 4.3-fold to 199.33-fold in U266 and from
4.36-fold to 112.51-fold in NCI-H929 TSA-treated cells compared
with untreated cells. Up-regulated probe sets represent 70 unique
genes in the case of MM1, 146 unique genes in the case of U266,
and 169 unique genes in case of NCI-H929. Overall, 324 unique
genes of which 94% contain CpG islands were induced in one or
more of the three MM cell lines after exposure to TSA
(Supplementary Table S2).
Identification of genes induced by treatment of MM cell
lines with both drugs. At last, we determined the gene expression
profile of the three MM cell lines after exposure to the combination
of Aza-dC/TSA, which resulted in up-regulation of 215 probe sets
(1% of 22,283 transcripts analyzed) in the cell line MM1, 276 probe
sets (1.2%) in U266, and 254 probe sets (1.1%) in NCI-H929,
respectively. The level of induced expression varied from 4.26-fold
to a maximum of 147.44-fold in MM1, from 4.35-fold to 295.04-fold

TSA or Aza-dC/TSA were analyzed using the GoMiner program
(23). GoMiner dereplicates total and changed input files so that
only one instance of a gene name is processed. This resulted in
13,018 reference genes to which 284 genes whose expression was
up-regulated after Aza-dC treatment, 324 genes whose expression
was up-regulated after TSA treatment, and 470 genes whose
expression was up-regulated after Aza-dC/TSA treatment were
compared. Detailed results are shown in Table 2. Aza-dC and TSA
were found to up-regulate different groups of genes. Although AzadC treatment resulted in statistically highly significant upregulation of genes involved in response to stimulus and immune
response TSA treatment up-regulated genes involved in cell
organization and biogenesis. In addition, statistically significant
up-regulation of genes involved in apoptosis, cell cycle, cell
adhesion, proliferation, and cell migration was observed (Table 2).

in U266, and from 4.43-fold to 209.97-fold in NCI-H929 Aza-dC/TSAtreated cells compared with untreated cells. Up-regulated probe
sets represent 180 unique genes in the case of MM1, 242 unique
genes in the case of U266, and 216 unique genes in case of NCIH929. Overall, 470 unique genes of which 88% contain CpG islands
were induced in one or more of the three MM cell lines after
exposure to the combination of Aza-dC and TSA (Supplementary
Table S3).
In addition, the distribution of up-regulated genes was relatively
even; however, the highest proportions of induced genes were located
at chromosome 6 where a 7 Mb cluster with high density of upregulated genes was identified (Supplementary Fig. S1A and S1B).
This cluster contains genes encoding for MHC class II proteins
that are normally constitutively expressed in antigen-presenting cells.
Overlap of up-regulated genes between MM cell lines and
drug treatment. To evaluate overlaps of Aza-dC and TSA upregulated genes between MM cell lines, Venn diagrams were
generated which show that there is only a limited overlap of AzadC and/or TSA-induced genes in the three MM cell lines (Fig. 1A).
Four genes were found to be up-regulated in all 3 MM cell lines
after Aza-dC treatment, 11 genes after TSA treatment, and 35 genes
after Aza-dC/TSA treatment, respectively. By comparing genes upregulated in two cell lines after Aza-dC, TSA, or Aza-dC/TSA
treatment, it is noteworthy that in MM1 and NCI-H929 more
commonly up-regulated genes were found than in U266 when
compared with MM1 and NCI-H929. Next, we identified genes
whose expression was up-regulated as response to a particular
drug in each cell line individually (Fig. 1B). Interestingly, only 2, 1,
and 2 genes were commonly up-regulated after Aza-dC and TSA
treatment in MM1, U266, and NCI-H929, respectively, indicating
that Aza-dC and TSA affect different groups of genes and pathways.
In addition, a high percentage (57% in MM1, 67% in U266, and 41%
in NCI-H929, respectively) of genes induced by TSA were also found
to be up-regulated after Aza-dC/TSA treatment in each cell line.
However, the percentage of commonly Aza-dC and Aza-dC/TSA
up-regulated genes was much lower (14% in MM1, 28% in U266,
and 19% in NCI-H929, respectively; Fig. 1B).
Identification of genes down-regulated after drug treatment. Although at a lower number we also identified genes whose
expression was down-regulated in MM cell lines. Treatment of the
cell lines with Aza-dC resulted in down-regulation of 76 genes in
MM1, of 20 genes in U266, and of 15 genes in NCI-H929,
respectively. After TSA treatment, 79 genes were found to be
down-regulated in MM1, 107 in U266, and 148 in NCI-H929,
respectively. Aza-dC/TSA treatment resulted in down-regulated
expression of 149 genes in MM1, 70 genes in U266, and 141 genes in
NCI-H929, respectively. Interestingly, by Aza-dC and TSA, downregulated genes included several proto-oncogenes that have been
found to be substantially overexpressed in MM (i.e., cyclin D1, cyclin
D2, MAF, MAFF, MAFG, FGFR3, MMSET; members of the myc
protein family and PIM2; Table 1). Of note, as shown in Table 1,
down-regulation of these genes was more a response to TSA and
Aza-dC/TSA than to Aza-dC alone. Results from microarray
analysis from certain cancer-related genes were validated by realtime RT-PCR (Tables 1 and 3). Detailed results are available online
(Supplementary Table S4).

Aza-dC and TSA Affected Cancer-Related Genes
Our approach identified several Aza-dC and/or TSA up-regulated
genes that are involved in important cancer-related pathways,
including cell cycle, proliferation, apoptosis, and cell adhesion
(Table 3). Aza-dC up-regulated genes previously reported to be
methylated in MM include CDH1 (4, 5), DAPK (5), TIMP3 (5), and
SOCS1 (5). More important, cancer-related genes, hitherto
unknown to be subject to epigenetic alterations in MM, have been
identified (i.e., JUP, BIK, CD9, BCL7c, AKAP12, TFPI2, CCNA1, SPARC,
and BNIP3). A summary of these genes is shown in Table 3.
Additionally, we found several cancer-related genes induced after
combined treatment of MM cell lines with Aza-dC/TSA (i.e.,
CDKN1A/p21, WIG1, BIK, CGREF1, JUP, and IGFBP3). Interestingly,
treatment of MM cell lines with TSA alone also resulted in upregulation of important cancer-related genes including ING1p33,
TIMP3, CDKN2D, PTENP1, CDKN1C/p57KIP2, DAPK, and WIG1,
suggesting that aberrant histone deacetylation is an important
mechanism for inactivation of cancer-related genes in MM.

Methylation Analysis of 10 Cancer-Related Genes in
MM Cell Lines by MSP
Based on our microarray data, we selected 10 genes whose
expression was up-regulated after drug treatment of MM cell lines
and analyzed their methylation status in six MM cell lines. The
genes analyzed were CPEB1, CD9, GJA1, BCL7c, GADD45G, AKAP12,
TFPI2, CCNA1, SPARC, and BNIP3. All of these genes were identified
as having a CpG island in their 5¶ regions. We found methylation of
all of these genes in the six MM cell lines at varying frequencies
(Fig. 1C). The most frequently methylated gene was BCL7c
(methylated in 100%) followed by AKAP12, SPARC, and TFPI2
(83%, respectively); CPEB1 (67%); GJA1, CCNA1, and BNIP3 (50%,
respectively); CD9 (33%); and GADD45G (17%). Aberrant methylation of up to 9 of the 10 genes per cell line was observed.

Methylation Analysis of 10 Cancer-Related Genes in
Samples from Patients with MGUS and MM
To investigate if methylation of the 10 genes was not only a
phenomenon in MM cell lines, we performed MSP analysis of
the 10 genes also in samples from 24 MGUS and 111 MM patients.
As shown in Fig. 1E, the frequency of methylation of the 10 genes
was lower in MGUS samples (17% for CPEB1, 16% for CD9, 13%
for GJA1, 8% for BCL7c, 5% for AKAP12, and 4% for BNIP3; no
methylation was found for GADD45G, TFPI2, CCNA1, and SPARC)
compared with MM samples (50% for CPEB1, 28% for CD9, 23% for
GJA1, 21% for BCL7c, 19% for GADD45G, 13% for AKAP12, 10% for
TFPI2, 8% for CCNA1, 8% for SPARC, and 5% for BNIP3). This

addition, 105 patients with MM were used for overall survival
analysis. We observed that methylation of BNIP3 and SPARC
correlated with a poor overall survival of the patients (P = 0.003,
P = 0.017, respectively; log-rank test; Fig. 2A). Moreover, BNIP3
and/or SPARC methylation that has been observed in 12% of MM
patients statistically significantly correlated with a poor overall
survival of these patients (P = 0.0004). Additionally, immunostaining of bone marrow biopsies of MM patients whose bone marrow
specimen were SPARC methylated (n = 4) and of patients whose
bone marrow specimen were SPARC unmethylated (n = 3) was
performed. Interestingly, in all samples that were found to be
methylated myeloma cells did not express SPARC. In two of three
samples that were found to be SPARC unmethylated, myeloma
cells showed homogeneous SPARC expression. In the remaining
sample, myeloma cells did not express SPARC (Fig. 2B). The

analyzed included age and gender of the patients, h2-microglobulin, LDH, hemoglobin, serum creatinine and calcium levels,
type of paraprotein, type of light chain, tumor stage, tumor grade,
and chromosome 13q14 deletion at the time of diagnosis. Factors

methylation status of any of the other 10 genes had no prognostic
effect. As reported previously, deletion of chromosome 13q is
associated with a poor prognosis of MM patients (1, 3). This
finding was also observed in our cohort of patients (P = 0.002).

Our microarray data revealed that expression of many genes was
up-regulated after Aza-dC and/or TSA treatment of MM cells. The
number of induced genes was very similar as reported for other cell
types (28–30). Using the online tools MethPrimer (26) and CpG
Island Searcher (27), we found that 73% of Aza-dC up-regulated
genes contained a CpG island. This is in agreement to other reports
that showed that inhibiting DNA methylation has both direct and
indirect effects on gene expression (30, 31). Interestingly, we
observed that 94% of genes whose expression was induced by
TSA contained a CpG island, suggesting that TSA more specifically
induces expression of CpG island containing genes than Aza-dC.
The difference between Aza-dC and TSA up-regulated CpG island
positive genes was statistically significant (P = 0.0000000007,
m2 test).
We observed that a few genes show an overlap in the upregulation between the three cell lines. In agreement to previous
reports demonstrating that each tumor contains up to 600
methylated genes, we also observed a high number of epigenetically regulated genes in each cell line (7). We hypothesize that this

Discussion
Epigenetic silencing of cancer-related genes is a frequently
occurring event in carcinogenesis (6). To date, only a few genes
are known to be aberrantly methylated in MM. In an effort to
identify additional epigenetically silenced genes in MM cells and
to better understand the effects of Aza-dC and TSA on gene
expression of MM cells, we examined expression profiles of three
MM cell lines treated with Aza-dC and TSA, either alone or in
combination using the microarray technique. Moreover, we
compared these results with expression results from untreated
cells. Additionally, using MSP, we investigated aberrant methylation patterns of 10 selected genes in MM cell lines and samples
from patients with MGUS and MM.

down-regulation did not pass our filtering criteria, gp130 downregulation was observed. Interestingly, Mitsiades et al. (37) reported
that treatment of MM cells using the HDAC inhibitor SAHA
resulted in down-regulation of both IL-6R and gp130, suggesting
that inhibition of IL-6 pathway using HDAC inhibitors might be a
new strategy in the future treatment of MM patients.
By comparing expression profiles of Aza-dC– and/or TSA-treated
cells and untreated cells, we identified a large number of
up-regulated cancer-related genes that are involved in several
cancer-associated pathways, including cell cycle, cell growth, and
apoptosis (Tables 2 and 3). Thus far, epigenetic silencing was not
known for most of these genes. We selected 10 genes (CPEB1, CD9,
GJA1, BCL7c, GADD45G, AKAP12, TFPI2, CCNA1, SPARC, and BNIP3)
whose expression was up-regulated after drug treatment and
determined their methylation status in 6 MM cell lines, 24 samples
from patients with MGUS, and 111 samples from patients with MM
by MSP. Our methylation results support previous studies that
showed that methylation of multiple cancer-related genes is a
frequently occurring event in the pathogenesis of MM. The most
frequently methylated gene in MM samples was CBEP1, a gene
whose epigenetic silencing in malignant diseases has not been
reported thus far. CPEB1 belongs to the cytoplasmic polyadenylation element binding protein family. Besides its function as
translational activator, it has been reported that CPEB1 has also
translational repressor properties by inducing stress granules (38).
By comparing our methylation data with clinicopathologic
characteristics from the MM patients, we observed that CPEB1
methylation was already present in MGUS samples but at a
statistically significantly higher frequency in MM samples
(P = 0.003), suggesting that CPEB1 methylation may be an early

pattern represents the individual character of each cell line;
however, we believe that the commonly altered genes may be ‘‘key
players’’ in the pathogenesis of MM.
Increased expression of proto-oncogenes has been described for
many different malignancies. One of the novel findings of our
present study is that several proto-oncogenes that are involved in
the pathogenesis of MM were down-regulated after treatment of
MM cells with Aza-dC and TSA (Table 1). Down-regulation may be
explained either by a direct inhibitory effect of Aza-dC and TSA or
by an indirect down-regulation by Aza-dC and TSA affected genes.
Proto-oncogenes that are frequently overexpressed in MM include
CCND1, MAF, FGFR , and MMSET (32–34). In our microarray assay,
MAF is substantially down-regulated by TSA and Aza-dC/TSA in all
three MM cell lines analyzed. In addition, expression of target
genes (CCND2, CCR1, and ITGB7) of the MAF transcription factor
was down-regulated in MM cell lines after TSA and Aza-dC/TSA
treatment, suggesting that TSA primarily inhibits MAF and
secondarily down-regulates CCND2, CCR1, and ITGB7. Similar
results were found for FGFR3, which promotes MM cell
proliferation and antiapoptosis and MMSET. We found expression
of both genes strongly down-regulated in response to TSA and
Aza-dC/TSA in all three MM cell lines analyzed. In addition, we
observed that components of the IL-6 signaling pathway are
affected by Aza-dC and/or TSA providing an additional mechanism
to inhibit proliferation and induce apoptosis of MM cells. The IL-6/
IL-6R complex associates with gp130 (IL-6ST), which was found to
be up-regulated in myeloma cells (35), resulting in promotion of
cell proliferation and survival. We found that TSA and Aza-dC/TSA
treatment of U266 cells, which are known to produce IL-6 (36),
resulted in marked down-regulation of IL-6R. Moreover, although

of MM.
Interestingly, we observed that methylation of two genes, SPARC
and BNIP3, was associated with a poor overall survival of MM
patients (Fig. 2A), suggesting that methylation of these genes may

event in the development of monoclonal gammopathies. In
addition, although the difference in overall survival between
patients with and without CPEB1 methylation was statistically
not significant, we observed a trend toward a poor prognosis for
MM patients with CPEB1 methylation. Additional studies are

frequency of BNIP3 methylation in our study was much lower (5%).
This discrepancy may be explained by the different sample sizes
analyzed. Our results suggest that MM cells of some patients
escape hypoxia-induced apoptosis through down-regulating BNIP3
by methylation and that these cells are more aggressive than BNIP3
unmethylated MM cells.
In conclusion, we show that expression of a large number of
genes that are involved in important cancer-related pathways is
affected by Aza-dC and TSA. Methylation of certain genes whose
epigenetic silencing in MM has not been reported thus far might be
important in the development and progression of MM. In addition,
our results suggest that inhibition of DNA methyltransferases and
HDACs might be new therapeutic strategies in the future treatment
of MM patients.

is a matrix-associated protein that modulates cellular interaction
with the extracellular matrix and inhibits cellular proliferation (39).
Its role in tumorigenesis is complex, and expression is often being
down-regulated in tumor cells accompanied by up-regulation in
juxtatumoral stromal cells. It has been suggested that acting of
SPARC either as tumor suppressor or oncogene may depend on the
tumor stage (40). Recent reports showed that SPARC methylation
is associated with loss of SPARC expression in lung, pancreatic,
and colon cancer (40–42). We investigated SPARC protein
expression in bone marrow biopsies of a small group of MM
patients by immunostaining. Whereas all SPARC methylated
samples did not express SPARC in the myeloma cells, all except
one unmethylated sample showed homogeneous SPARC protein
expression in the myeloma cells. Although the number of samples
investigated was very small, our results show that SPARC
methylation is associated with loss of SPARC protein expression,
suggesting the hypothesis that SPARC acts as a tumor suppressor
in MM. BNIP3 is a proapoptotic member of the Bcl-2 protein family
involved in hypoxia-induced cell death. Loss of BNIP3 expression
due to DNA methylation has been reported recently in colorectal
and pancreatic cancer (43, 44). In addition, Murai et al. (45) found
BNIP3 methylation in 21% (3 of 14) of MM samples. However, the
