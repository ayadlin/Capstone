Abstract
The estrogen dependence of breast cancer has long been
recognized; however, the role of 17B-estradiol (E2) in cancer
initiation was not known until we showed that it induces
complete neoplastic transformation of the human breast
epithelial cells MCF-10F. E2 treatment of MCF-10F cells
progressively induced high colony efficiency and loss of
ductulogenesis in early transformed (trMCF) cells and
invasiveness in Matrigel invasion chambers. The cells that
crossed the chamber membrane were collected and identified
as bsMCF; their subclones were designated bcMCF; and
the cells harvested from carcinoma formation in severe
combined immunodeficient mice were designated caMCF.
These phenotypes correlated with gene dysregulation during
the progression of the transformation. The highest number
of dysregulated genes was observed in caMCF, being slightly
lower in bcMCF, and lowest in trMCF. This order was
consistent with the extent of chromosome aberrations (caMCF
> bcMCF >>> trMCF). Chromosomal amplifications were found
in 1p36.12-pter, 5q21.1-qter, and 13q21.31-qter. Losses of the
complete chromosome 4 and 8p11.21-23.1 were found only in
tumorigenic cells. In tumor-derived cell lines, additional
losses were found in 3p12.1-14.1, 9p22.1-pter, and 18q11.21qter. Functional profiling of dysregulated genes revealed
progressive changes in the integrin signaling pathway,
inhibition of apoptosis, acquisition of tumorigenic cell surface
markers, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition. In tumorigenic cells, the levels of E-cadherin, epithelial membrane
antigen, and various keratins were low and CD44E/CD24 were
negative, whereas SNAI2, vimentin, S100A4, FN1, HRAS,
transforming growth factor B1, and CD44H were high. The
phenotypic and genomic changes triggered by estrogen
exposure that lead normal cells to tumorigenesis confirm
the role of this steroid hormone in cancer initiation. [Cancer

advanced cancer in premenopausal women by surgically removing
the ovaries. Thereafter, the same procedure was also proven to
control the progression of metastatic disease (2). The identification
of estrogen (E2) production by the ovaries, the isolation of the
estrogen receptor (ER) protein, and the greater incidence of ERapositive tumors observed in postmenopausal women led to the
identification of a strong association between estrogen exposure
with increased breast cancer risk (3). Despite the epidemiologic
and clinical evidence linking cumulative and sustained exposure to
estrogens with increased risk of developing breast cancer (3), the
ultimate mechanisms by which estrogens induce cancer and the
specific cells they act upon for initiating malignant transformation
have not been fully identified. Among the mechanisms of estrogen
action, the most widely acknowledged is the binding of the
hormone to its specific nuclear ERa, initiating a signal that is
potently mitogenic (4). However, the fact that ERa knockout mice
expressing the Wnt-1 oncogene (ERKO/Wnt-1) develop mammary
tumors in response to treatment with estrogen provides direct
evidence that E2 may cause breast cancer through a genotoxic,
non-ERa–mediated mechanism (5). This postulate is further
supported by the observation that when ovariectomized mice are
supplemented with estrogen, they develop a higher tumor
incidence with shorter latency time than control animals, even in
the presence of the pure antiestrogen ICI-182,780. Experimental
studies on estrogen metabolism (6), formation of DNA adducts (7),
carcinogenicity (8, 9), mutagenicity (10), and cell transformation
(11, 12) have supported the hypothesis that reaction of specific
estrogen metabolites, namely catechol estrogen-3,4-quinones (CE3,4-Q) and, to a much lesser extent, CE-2,3-Q, can generate critical
DNA mutations that initiate breast, prostate, and other cancers
(13–15).
Our observations that ductal carcinomas originate in lobules
type 1 (Lob.1) of the immature breast (16), which are the structures
with the highest proliferative activity and highest percentage of
ERa and progesterone receptor–positive cells, provide a mechanistic explanation for the higher susceptibility of these structures to
undergo neoplastic transformation when exposed to chemical
carcinogens, as shown by in vitro experiments (17). However, the
role of ERa-positive and ERa-negative cells in the initiation of
breast cancer is not clear. The fact that the cells that do proliferate
in culture are ERa-negative suggests that the stem cells that
originate cancer are the ERa-negative proliferating cells. This idea
is further supported by our observations that MCF-10F, a
spontaneously immortalized ERa-negative human breast epithelial
cell line derived from breast tissues containing Lob.1 and Lob.2
(18), becomes malignant after exposure to the chemical carcinogen
benz(a)pyrene (17) and 17h-estradiol (E2; refs. 12, 19).
Breast cancer has been subdivided into five major subtypes:
basal-like, Her2 (ERBB2)–overexpressing, normal breast tissue-like,
and two subtypes of luminal-like, luminal A and luminal B (20). The

luminal-like subtypes display moderate to high expression of ERa
and luminal cytokeratins, whereas the basal-like subtype is
negative for both ERa and ERBB2, with high expression of basal
cytokeratins 5 and 17. The ERBB2-overexpressing subtype is also
ERa negative and, like the basal-like tumors, is associated with
poorer prognosis as measured as time to development of distal
metastasis (20–22). Altogether, these data support the concept that
ER-positive and ER-negative tumors may originate from two
different cell populations, as postulated earlier (14). In addition to
differences inherent to the type of cell in which cancer originates,
neoplastically initiated cells lose specific characteristics of
epithelial differentiation as the result of their progression toward
malignancy. As the epithelial cells lose their polarity and cell-to-cell
junctions, regulated in part by the expression of E-cadherin, they
acquire characteristics of mesenchymal cells, which lack stable
intercellular junctions (21). This epithelial to mesenchymal
transition (EMT) leads to exacerbation of motility and invasiveness
in many cell types and is often considered a prerequisite for tumor
infiltration and metastasis (21).
To outline the pathways through which estrogen acts as
carcinogen in the human breast (i.e., either through the receptor
pathway or through a genotoxic effect in a specific cell type of the
breast), we used an in vitro-in vivo system in which the
spontaneously immortalized ERa-negative human breast epithelial
cell (HBEC) line MCF-10F was transformed by treatment with
E2 (23). E2-transformed cells progressively express phenotypes of
in vitro cell transformation, including colony formation in agar
methocel, decreased ductulogenesis, increased invasiveness in a
Matrigel invasion system, and tumorigenesis in a heterologous
host. Tumors formed in severe combined immunodeficient (SCID)
mice by invasive cells and by cell lines derived from those tumors
were poorly differentiated ERa-, progesterone receptor–, and
ERBB2-negative adenocarcinomas (24). These characteristics are
similar to those of basal cell type primary carcinomas previously
described (25). To better understand the molecular events
associated with the progressive phenotypic changes that were
observed during estrogen-mediated malignant cell transformation,
we performed Affymetrix 100k single nucleotide polymorphism
(SNP) arrays to measure chromosomal copy number and loss of
heterozygosity (LOH), and HG-U133_Plus_2 array for analyzing
mRNA expression in MCF-10F cells at different stages of cell
transformation. By integrating these data, we were able to identify
associations between copy number changes, LOH, and tumorigenic
phenotype, as well as the related changes in transcript expression.
Functional analyses of these data identified several dysregulated
pathways associated with progressive tumorigenic and invasive
capacity.

Materials and Methods
Experimental model of transformation of MCF-10F cells by E2
treatment. These studies were performed using the spontaneously
immortalized ERa-negative human breast epithelial cell line MCF-10F. As
it was described in a previous publication, cells cultured and treated with 70
nmol/L E2 were collected 24 h after the last treatment and maintained in
culture for 10 additional passages (24). Thereafter, control and E2-treated
MCF-10F cells were evaluated for colony formation in agar-methocel, or
colony efficiency, ductulogenic capacity in collagen-matrix, invasiveness in
Matrigel invasion chambers, and tumorigenic assay in SCID mice, as
previously described (24). E2-treated MCF-10F cells formed colonies in agar
methocel, exhibiting a high colony efficiency, and lost their ductulogenic
capacity in collagen-matrix, forming instead spherical masses; cells

exhibiting these characteristics were classified as transformed (trMCF).
Briefly, as it was described, trMCF cells were seeded onto Matrigel invasion
chambers and at the end of a 22-h incubation period, cells that had crossed
the membrane were collected and identified as bsMCF cells (24). The
tumorigenic ability of control MCF-10F, trMCF, and bsMCF was tested by
injecting them into the mammary fat pad of 45-day-old female SCID mice
(24). MCF-10F and trMCF cells did not induce tumors, whereas bsMCF
formed tumors. From the tumors formed by the bsMCF cells, four cancer
cell lines were derived and identified as caMCF1, caMCF2, caMCF3, and
caMCF4 (these cells were previously called E2-70-C5-A1-T1, E2-70-C5-A4-T4,
E2-70-C5-A8-T8, and E2-70-C5-A6-T6, respectively; ref. 24). The caMCF1,
caMCF2, caMCF3, and caMCF4 were isolated from four tumors from four
different animals (24).
Ring cloning and tumorigenesis in mice. The invasive bsMCF cells
were plated at low density and cell colonies were isolated using cloning rings.
The cells were cultured in DMEM:F12 medium containing 1.05 mmol/L
calcium, antimycotics, hormones, growth factors, and equine serum (24).
After trypsinization and plating, the clones obtained were identified as
bcMCF-1, bcMCF-2, bcMCF-3, bcMCF-4, bcMCF-5, bcMCF-6, and bcMCF-7.
The tumorigenic ability of the bcMCF subclones was tested by injecting them
into the mammary fat pad of 45-day-old female SCID mice (see
Supplementary Table S1).
Affymetrix microarray expression and genotyping assay. MCF-10F
cells at three different passages, designated MCF-10F1, MCF-10F2, and
MCF-10F3 (passages 135, 137, and 138, respectively); trMCF cells at three
different passages, designated trMCF1, trMCF2, and trMCF3 (passages 20,
22, and 23, respectively); bcMCF clones 1, 2, and 3; and caMCF 1, 2, and 3
cells were used for microarray expression and genotyping assay (Fig. 1A).
Total RNA and high molecular weight genomic DNA were isolated using
Stat-60 (Tel-Test, Inc.) and the DNA isolation protocol previously described
(24). After hybridization, the chips were scanned using GeneChip Scanner
3000. The SNP genotype calls (heterozygous or homozygous) were
determined by GTYPE v 4.0. MCF-10F served as the diploid reference for
detection of copy number changes by dChip. The human genome release
v17 was used to generate the genome information for SNP data analysis.
Hierarchical clustering of samples based on copy number was performed
using the default parameters in dChip.
The intensities of probe sets were calculated by dChip with Perfectmatch/Mismatch difference model after invariant-set normalization. Three
lists of differentially expressed genes (dysregulated genes) were generated
by pairwise comparison using MCF-10F cells as reference. The significance
of differential expression was determined by the following combined
criteria: (a) the gene in all three samples of at least one group in pairwise
comparison is expressed (determined by GCOS ‘‘Present’’ call); (b)
difference between the average value of the gene in the two compared
groups z50; (c) fold change z1.7; (d) unpaired t test using log-transformed
intensities, followed by Benjamini-Hochberg procedure controlling false
discovery rate (q V 0.08). For probe sets representing the same Entrez
Gene or UniGene ID, only the one with lowest q value was included in the
gene list.
Identification of chromosomes and Gene Ontology categories
enriched with differentially expressed genes. The functional profiles
were represented by the biological processes in the Gene Ontology (GO)
database (26). The number of dysregulated genes in each chromosome or
GO category was compared with that of all genes in the HG-U133_Plus_2
chip to determine the significance of the chromosome or GO category. The
analysis was performed using Onto-Express,3 with the default selection of
statistical method (hypergeometric distribution followed by false discovery
rate correction). The three lists of genes dysregulated in trMCF, bcMCF, or
caMCF were uploaded into Onto-Express to identify significant GO
categories (q V 0.05 with five or more genes). The up- or down-regulated
genes were uploaded into Onto-Express separately to identify the individual
chromosomes enriched (q V 0.0001) with these genes.

Ingenuity pathway analysis. The differentially expressed genes were
uploaded into the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software.4
Immunocytochemical analysis. The cells were scraped into the
medium, centrifuged, and the cell pellets were suspended in 10%
phosphate-buffered formalin. After overnight fixation at 4jC, the pellets
were embedded in 2% agarose, postfixed in 10% phosphate-buffered
formalin, and embedded in paraffin. The following mouse monoclonal
antibodies were used: E-cadherin, clone 36 (BD Transduction Laboratories),
epithelial membrane antigen (EMA) clone E29 and vimentin, clone V9, both
from DakoCytomation, Inc. All sections were lightly counterstained with
hematoxylin.
Expression of CD24 and CD44. The microarray expression levels of
CD24 and CD44 were validated and further explored by reverse
transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) and flow cytometry analysis [fluorescenceactivated cell sorting (FACS)] that was performed at the Cell Sorting Facility
of the Fox Chase Cancer Center. For RT-PCR, 40 to 80 ng of cDNA were used
for PCR amplification in GeneAmp PCR System 9700 (Applied Biosystems).
PCR primers were designed to span exons 2 to 18 of CD44, to characterize
the expression of alternative splicing variants. The sequence of forward (F)
and reverse (R) primers are as follows: CD24, F-GCCAGTCTCTTCGTGGTCTC; R-CTCCATTCCACAATCCCATC; CD44, F-GAGCATCGGATTTGAGACCTG; R-AGCTCCATTGCCACTGTTGAT; h-actin, F-ACCCACACTGTGCCCATCTACGA; R-AGCTGGAAGCAGCCGTGGCCAT. The
density of the bands was quantified using a scanner (Expression 836XL,
EPSON) and measurement software (Image J, W.S. Rasband, NIH, MD).5

FACS was performed using FITC mouse anti-human CD24 and phycoerythrin mouse anti-human CD44 antibodies from BD Biosciences. Cells (106)
were stained and analyzed by FACS using a LSR II system (BD Biosciences).
These experiments were repeated twice.

Results
Analysis of chromosome copy number and LOH in neoplastically transformed MCF-10F cells. MCF-10F cells that after
treatment with E2 expressed high colony efficiency and loss of
ductulogenic capacity in collagen-matrix represented the first level
of in vitro transformation. Cells expressing these two variables were
classified as transformed (trMCF), which after further selection for
invasiveness in a Matrigel invasion chamber originated the second
level of transformation: the invasive (bsMCF) and the cloned
(bcMCF) cells (Fig. 1A). The bsMCF cells formed tumors in SCID
mice from which four cell lines, caMCF, were derived (Fig. 1A). By
ring cloning, seven subclones were isolated from the invasive
bsMCF cells: bcMCF-1, bcMCF-2, bcMCF-3, bcMCF-4, bcMCF-5,
bcMCF-6, and bcMCF-7. All the bcMCF subclones produced invasive poorly differentiated tumors in SCID mice with different morphologic phenotypes: spindle cell type (bcMCF-1 and bcMCF-4),
epithelial cell type (bcMCF-2, bcMCF-6, and bcMCF-7), and with
mix features of spindle and epithelial type (bcMCF-3 and bcMCF-5;
Supplementary Table S1). As it was previously reported, MCF-10F
cells were seeded on Boyden chamber as control; cells that passed
through the membrane were selected, expanded, and injected in
SCID mice; these cells did not produce tumors (24).

Using the 100k SNP GeneChip Mapping Array set, the DNA from
MCF-10F, trMCF, bcMCF, and caMCF were analyzed for the
structure of chromosomes 1 to 22 and X at very high resolution
(Fig. 1B and C). Changes in copy number (Fig. 1B) and LOH
(Fig. 1C) were progressive in these cells. The three different
passages of MCF-10F exhibited identical copy number, and these
data served as the reference for copy number analysis. Only small
and scattered chromosome gains were observed in trMCF cells and
most alterations were observed in the bcMCF and caMCF (Fig. 1B).
Large fragments of chromosome gain were observed only in the
telomeric ends at 1p36.12-pter and 5q21.1-qter in both bcMCF and
caMCF, and 13q21.31-qter in bcMCF (Fig. 1B, dark pink areas).
Almost no chromosome loss was detected in the trMCF cells and
very few in bcMCF1 clone, whereas bcMCF2 and bcMCF3 clones
and the three caMCF cell lines exhibited loss of the whole
chromosome 4 and loss of 8p11.21-23.1 (Fig. 1B, pale pink areas).
Loss of 3p12.1-14.1, 9p22.1-pter, and 18q11.2-qter was observed in
the three lines of caMCF (Fig. 1B). Deletion was also observed in
7pter and 13pter of bcMCF2, but not in the rest of tumorigenic
cells, indicating that such deletion is not required for the
expression of tumorigenic capacity.
The subclone bcMCF1 displayed higher frequency of chromosome 8 amplification (Supplementary Fig. S1A) and lower
frequency of chromosome 4 deletion when compared with the

subclones bcMCF2 and bcMCF3 (Supplementary Fig. S1B). Also,
subclones bcMCF2 and bcMCF3 showed a small deletion on
chromosome 8 that bcMCF1 did not have (Fig. 1B, pale pink area
in bcMCF2 and bcMCF3). However, sample clustering based on
copy number profile grouped the bcMCF1 in the tumorigenic
class together with bcMCF2; bcMCF3; and caMCF1, caMCF2, and
caMCF3 (Supplementary Fig. S1C), and this was confirmed by
sample clustering based on gene expression profile (see below
EMT phenotype). The cells trMCF1, trMCF2, and trMCF3 were
clustered as nontumorigenic (Supplementary Fig. S1C). Furthermore, all bcMCF clones were shown to form tumors in SCID
mice (Supplementary Table S1). Therefore, the isolation of
subclones may afford the possibility to detect minimal regions
of copy number change associated with neoplastic cell transformation.
This cell transformation model involves treatment of immortal
MCF-10F cells and selection for a transformed phenotype followed
by further selection for invasiveness and then tumorigenesis
(Fig. 1A). As major copy number changes and LOH were observed
in chromosome 4 (Fig. 1B and C), we present this chromosome at
higher resolution. Interestingly, the copy number loss in chromosome 4 detected in bcMCF can be observed in trMCF cells
(Supplementary Fig. S2, arrows), albeit at a level that does not
reach statistical significance.

differentially expressed genes. The top three

number of total dysregulated genes was observed in caMCF cells
(1,306 genes, 340 up-regulated versus 966 down-regulated), slightly
lower in bcMCF (1,236 genes, 160 up-regulated versus 1,076 downregulated), and the lowest in trMCF cells (260 genes, 45 upregulated versus 215 down-regulated). This order was consistent
with the extent of chromosome aberrations: number of regions and
size in caMCF > bcMCF >>> trMCF (Fig. 1B).
To further investigate the relationship between transcript levels
and copy number, we analyzed the list of up- and down-regulated
genes using Onto-Express software, to identify chromosomes
significantly enriched (or overrepresented) with dysregulated
genes. The chromosomes enriched with up-regulated (Fig. 2A) or
down-regulated (Fig. 2B) genes also showed large regions of
amplification or deletion (Fig. 1B), respectively. For example,
chromosomes 18, 4, and 8 were significantly overrepresented by
down-regulated genes in caMCF cells (Fig. 2B, caMCF), and,
correspondently, showed large regions of deletion in caMCF
(Fig. 1B). Similarly, chromosome 4 was overrepresented by downregulated genes in bcMCF cells (Fig. 2B, bcMCF), and showed the
largest copy number loss in these cells (Fig. 1B). Chromosomes
1 and 5 were significantly overrepresented by up-regulated genes in

both bcMCF and caMCF cells (Fig. 2A, bcMCF and caMCF), and,
correspondently, showed largest copy number amplification
(Fig. 1B). However, some exceptions were noteworthy. Chromosome 13 showed a high frequency of SNP amplification (50%) in
bcMCF (Supplementary Fig. S1A), but was not enriched with upregulated genes. In fact, there were only six genes up-regulated in
this region. Moreover, this amplification was not maintained in
caMCF (Fig. 1B), indicating that this aberration was not required
for tumorigenesis. Also, chromosome 11 was overrepresented by
down-regulated genes in trMCF (Fig. 2B, trMCF), although trMCF
cells did not show any copy number deletion (Fig. 1B). This might
imply that certain epigenetic modifications, instead of copy
number loss, are related to the observed decrease in the number
of genes expressed on chromosome 11 of trMCF cells.
Biological processes enriched with the dysregulated genes.
GO analysis identified eight biological processes enriched with
dysregulated genes in trMCF, bcMCF, and caMCF cells, suggesting
that changes in these processes were involved in the in vitro
transformation phenotype (Table 1). Two additional processes,
DNA replication and nucleosome assembly, were found only in the
trMCF cells. The DNA replication process in trMCF cells contained
six genes. Each of these genes was up-regulated, including
replication factor C, 2.1-fold; SET translocation, 1.8-fold; DNA
directed polymerase epsilon 2, 2.7-fold; ribonucleotide reductase M2
polypeptide, 1.7-fold; minichromosome maintenance deficient 4, 1.7fold; and topoisomerase (DNA) IIa, 1.8-fold. Moreover, 11 biological
processes were found uniquely in the tumorigenic cells bcMCF and

caMCF, suggesting that they were involved in the process of
neoplastic transformation (Table 1). Most of the genes in the 11 GO
categories showed decreased expression relative to MCF-10F. For
example, the fraction of down-regulated genes was 24 of 28 in
‘‘apoptosis’’ (Supplementary Table S2), 13 of 16 in ‘‘positive
regulation of IKB/NFKB cascade,’’ and 19 of 21 in ‘‘lipid metabolism’’
(data not shown).
Identification of significant canonical pathways. Ingenuity
Pathway Analysis revealed six canonical pathways significantly
dysregulated in one or more groups (Fig. 2C). The genes associated
with each of these pathways, integrin signaling, pyrimidine
metabolism, transforming growth factor h (TGF-h) signaling,
glutathione metabolism, extracellular signal-regulated kinase/
mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling, and amyloid processing
are listed in Table 2 and Supplementary Table S3.

Integrin signaling was the most significantly altered pathway in
each of the three cell lines, indicating a continuum change within
this pathway throughout the progressive, malignant cell transformation of MCF-10F cells. In this pathway, eight genes were downregulated in trMCF cells (Table 2). Of interest, expression levels of
several of these decreased genes, such as ITGB6, LAMA3, and
LAMC2, were inhibited to even a greater extent in the tumorigenic
cells. In contrast, fibronectin 1, which was completely suppressed
( 18.9 fold, ‘‘Absent’’) in trMCF, was strongly induced in bcMCF
(4.9-fold) and caMCF (2.8-fold; Fig. 3A, FN1). In comparison with the
trMCF, the number of dysregulated genes associated with integrin
signaling was much higher in the bcMCF and caMCF cells, showing
both increased and decreased levels of expression (Table 2).
Levels of expression of several genes involved in glutathione metabolism were decreased in the bcMCF and caMCF

(Supplementary Table S3). Multiple glutathione S-transferase (GST)
isoforms were down-regulated, including GST j1, x2, pi, MGST 2,
and MGST3. Moreover, glutamate cysteine ligase, the enzyme
catalyzing the first rate-limiting reaction in glutathione biosynthesis, was also reduced in the tumorigenic cells. Glutathione is a
cellular antioxidant and a substrate for GST, which catalyzes the
conjugation reactions with electrophiles. Repressed antioxidant
activity is associated with the genomic damage and cancer
incidence induced by exposure to the cytotoxic free radical and
reactive oxygen species (27).
EMT phenotype. Analysis of the GO cellular component also
identified categories distinct between the nontumorigenic and

(q = 0.0, 13 genes), but not in trMCF cells (q = 0.4, 1 gene;
Supplementary Table S4). Numerous cytokeratins were suppressed
or absent, whereas vimentin was strongly induced in bcMCF
(7.0-fold) and caMCF (8.1-fold). Because of these findings, we
generated a gene list from published literature for epithelial
and mesenchymal markers and their regulators (Supplementary
Table S5). The 52 genes in the list were filtered by low stringency
criteria of combined coefficient of variation (CV) >0.3 and ‘‘Present
calls’’ in >30% of the samples. The 27 genes passing these criteria
were used for sample and gene clustering (Fig. 3A). Two sample
groups and two gene groups were identified. The nontumorigenic
MCF-10F and trMCF cells were grouped into sample cluster n,
whereas the tumorigenic bcMCF and caMCF cells were grouped
into cluster E. On the other side, the genes were grouped into

clusters a and h based on their expression pattern. The epithelial
markers E-cadherin (CDH1), occludin (OCLN), desmoplakin (DSP),
and cytokertins (KRT) were decreased, whereas the mesenchymal
markers fibronectin (FN1), vimentin (VIM), and N-cadherin (CDH2)
were increased in bcMCF and caMCF cells (Fig. 3). By real-time
RT-PCR, it was confirmed that the expression of FN1, S100A4, SNAI2,
HRAS, and TGFh1 were increased, whereas CDH1 (E-cadherin)
was decreased in bcMCF and caMCF cells (Supplementary Fig. S3).
Immunocytochemical analysis using antibodies against EMA (also
called MUC1) and E-cadherin displayed significant loss of these
epithelial markers (Fig. 3B, j, k, n, o) and increased expression of the
mesenchymal marker vimentin (Fig. 3B, l, p) in tumorigenic cells.
These findings confirmed the EMT phenotype revealed by gene
expression profile in Fig. 3A. Interestingly, whereas most trMCF cells
were E-cadherin positive (+) and vimentin negative ( ), a few cells
were found to be E-cadherin ( ) (Fig. 3B, g, arrow) and vimentin (+)
(Fig. 3B, h, arrow).
Characterization of molecular markers of tumorigenic cells.
The cell surface molecule CD44 +/CD24 /low phenotype has been
identified as marker for tumor-initiating cells (28). Therefore, we
examined the expression pattern of these markers in relation to the
tumorigenic capacity of the cells in our model. Microarray data
revealed that CD44 was slightly decreased in trMCF but increased
in bcMCF and caMCF cells, whereas CD24 was completely lost in
both bcMCF and caMCF (Figs. 4A and B). The loss of CD24 in
bcMCF and caMCF was independently shown by RT-PCR (Fig. 4C,
middle). The alternative splicing variants of CD44 were identified
by the size of their PCR products and further validated by DNA
sequence analysis (data not shown). Only the variants of CD44H
and CD44E were expressed (Fig. 4C, top). CD44H was significantly
increased in both bcMCF and caMCF, whereas CD44E was
completely lost in these cells. The ratio of CD44H/CD44E was
significantly increased in trMCF, bcMCF, and caMCF (Fig. 4D). The
CD44 and CD24 gene expression in the different cell lines
correlated well with the cell surface protein expression studied
by FACS analysis (Supplementary Fig. S4). In addition, the ESA
(epithelial-specific antigen, also termed as Ep-CAM, or tumorassociated calcium signal transducer 1), was completely lost
in bcMCF and caMCF, but not changed in trMCF cells (see gene
list online6).

Discussion
This study integrates structural and functional genomic data
analyses to elucidate the progressive molecular events in the
E2-mediated malignant transformation of ER ( ) HBECs. Genomic
aberrations progressively accumulated as the cells expressed more
aggressive phenotypes (i.e., in the tumorigenic bcMCF and caMCF)
in comparison with the nontumorigenic trMCF cells. Accordingly,
the number of genes with altered levels of expression was greater in
the tumorigenic cells, as where the chromosomes enriched with
up- or down-regulated genes. Importantly, the 12 samples were
correctly classified into tumorigenic or nontumorigenic groups
based on the profile of copy number changes, indicating that in our
model changes in copy number provide a genomic signature for the
tumorigenic phenotype. Together, these findings revealed an
intrinsic link between E2-induced copy number changes, gene
expression alterations, and tumorigenesis in ERa ( ) HBECs.
The integrin signaling pathway was the most significantly altered
pathway in the progression of the neoplastic transformation.
Integrins function as heterodimeric receptors for extracellular
matrix proteins, mediating cell anchorage. The capacity of cells to

www.aacrjournals.org

survive and proliferate in the absence of integrin-mediated
adhesion in vitro strongly correlates with tumorigenesis in vivo
(29). The integrin signaling pathway was enriched with dysregulated genes in trMCF, bcMCF, and caMCF, indicating that this
pathway was affected in early stages of cell transformation.
In addition, GO analysis revealed enrichment of dysregulated
genes in the apoptotic process in tumorigenic cells (Supplementary
Table S2) and resistance to apoptosis is a hallmark of tumorigenesis. Therefore, suppression of apoptosis in the tumorigenic cells
might be a potential mechanism that confers survival onto these
cells with disrupted integrin signaling and anchorage-independent
growth (24).
EMT involves dedifferentiation of polarized epithelial cells to a
migratory fibroblastoid phenotype, a phenomenon that is increasingly considered to be an important event during cancer
progression and metastasis (30, 31). Cells selected from MCF-10F
by Boyden chamber are nontumorigenic (24), whereas all bcMCF
cells displayed consistent chromosomal aberrations and formed
tumors in SCID mice in our model. Although it cannot be totally
ruled out, it is very unlikely that bcMCF cells are derived from
preexisting mesenchymal cells.
EMT is accompanied by a profoundly altered mesenchymal gene
expression program, which is characterized by loss of epithelial
keratins and induction of mesenchymal vimentin (32). Induction
of S100A4 is an important early event in the pathway toward EMT
(33). The hallmark of EMT is the loss of expression of the cell
adhesion molecule E-cadherin (34). E-cadherin is a cell-cell
adhesion molecule that participates in homotypic, calciumdependent interactions to form epithelial adherens junctions. This
function is critical in the development and maintenance of a polar
epithelium. GSK3h was down-regulated in bcMCF and caMCF
(Fig. 3A). SNAI2 was down-regulated in trMCF but increased in
bcMCF and caMCF (Fig. 3A). It was shown that inhibition of
GSK3h resulted in the up-regulation of SNAI1 and down-regulation
of E-cadherin in vivo. SNAI2 (or SLUG) and SNAI1 (or SNAIL)
belong to the Snail family of proteins; both contain an NH2terminal repression domain and a COOH-terminal zinc-finger
DNA-binding domain. Snail proteins repress the transcription of
E-cadherin (35–39). E-cadherin loss is believed to contribute to
both cancer development and progression (35). HRAS and TGFh1
were up-regulated in bcMCF and caMCF (Supplementary Table S3).
It has been shown that HRAS cooperates with TGFh1 to cause
EMT and also it interacts with CD44 directly by increasing its
expression (40, 41). TGFh1 via HMGA2, which was also upregulated in bcMCF and caMCF, regulates the expression of TWIST,
SNAI1, and SNAI2 (42). EMT is associated with higher tumor grade,
high motility index, and ERa ( ) status (43). Therefore, these
findings revealed an intrinsic link between EMT and tumorigenic
capacity in our model, which, in part, may explain the poor
prognosis of ERa ( ) human breast carcinomas.
CD44 +/CD24 /low is the cell surface marker of tumorigenic
breast cancer cells in which the tumorigenic capacity is further
increased by additional expression of ESA (28). These cells are
characterized by a 186-gene ‘‘invasiveness’’ gene signature that is
associated with risk of death and metastasis in breast cancer (44).
CD24 encodes a small, heavily glycosylated cell-surface adhesion
protein. CD44 undergoes extensive alternative splicing within its
central region spanning exon 6a to 14, also termed as variable exon
v1 to v10. The two variants expressed in our model are mRNA
precursor variant 3 with exon 6a to 11 spliced out and variant 4
with exon 6a to 14 spliced out, corresponding to CD44E and

CD44H, respectively (45). The CD44H is mainly expressed on cells
of lymphohematopoietic origin; it plays an important role in cell
adhesion and its expression promotes tumor cell migration (46).
CD44E is preferentially expressed on epithelial cells and it is
involved in the recognition of a common determinant in CD44H
and CD44E promoting homotypic cellular aggregation (47). Microarray and RT-PCR analysis of CD44 and CD24 revealed an
expression pattern of CD44H high/CD44E /CD24 in bcMCF and
caMCF. The increased ratio of CD44H/CD44E in trMCF cells might
represent an early marker for E2-transformed HBECs. The
significant increase of CD44H and complete loss of CD44E might
be a novel phenotype associated with the tumorigenic capacity. In
addition, the loss of ESA in bcMCF and caMCF indicated that ESA
expression is not required for the tumorigenic capacity in our
model.
Two recent studies, using a GeneChip containing 1495 SNPs (48)
or comparative genomic hybridization (49), have shown that LOH
and allelic loss in 4p and 5q occur more frequently in subtypes of
breast cancer characterized as ERa ( ). SNP mapping reveals that
LOH in 4p14-15.3, 5q11-32, and 18q22-23 are significantly
associated with a gene expression profile in basal-like subtype
(48). In our model, the tumor cells caMCF also showed LOH in all
these three regions. Moreover, it has been shown that the CD44+/
CD24 phenotype is associated with mesenchymal phenotype and
invasion in breast cancer cell line, and may define breast cancers of
basal/myoepithelial origin rather than luminal origin (50). These
findings indicate a potential correlation of our model with the
basal-like subtype. However, the bcMCF and caMCF cells displayed
low or absent expression of both luminal and basal cytokeratins in
microarray analysis and ERBB2 ( ) in immunocytochemical
staining (data not shown). Therefore, they cannot simply be
classified into basal-like, ERBB2 (+), luminal A or B, or normal
breast-like subtype (20). Carey et al. (51) has identified an
‘‘unclassified’’ subtype using immunohistochemical markers for
the classification of breast cancer tissue. This subtype is

characterized as ERa ( ), ERBB2 ( ), and progesterone receptor
( ), which, for these markers, is the same phenotype as the basallike subtype. Unlike the basal-like subtype, the unclassified subtype
is cytokeratin 5 ( ). It also displays a histologic grade and survival
prognosis most close to that of basal-like subtype (51). Further
comparison of the tumorigenic cells in our model to clinical basallike or unclassified subtype is warranted.
Our results support the concept that E2-induced breast cancer is
a polygenic disease having a large range of genomic instabilities.
E2 and/or its metabolites can directly cause genomic aberrations
without the mediation of ERa. The genomic aberrations lead to
changes in gene expression, which result in disrupted integrin
signaling and apoptotic pathways, and epithelial to mesenchymal
transition. These functional changes lead to colony formation in
agar-methocel, loss of ductulogenesis in collagen matrix, invasiveness in vitro, and tumor growth in SCID mice in vivo (24). However,
MCF-10F is a spontaneously immortalized cell line harvested from
a woman’s breast that was free of malignancies, but had a diagnosis
of benign fibrocystic disease (52). Hence, we cannot rule out its
inherited susceptibility to estrogen and the disposition to
tumorigenesis. Therefore, more normal primary human breast
epithelial cell lines should be studied to validate and elaborate on
the molecular mechanisms unveiled by our results.
