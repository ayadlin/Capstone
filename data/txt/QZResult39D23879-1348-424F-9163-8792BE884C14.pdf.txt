BACKGROUND: The objectives of this retrospective study were to determine the frequency of undiagnosed alcoholism among patients with advanced cancer who were referred to palliative care and to explore its correlation with alcoholism, tobacco abuse, and use of illegal drugs. METHODS: The authors reviewed 665 consecutive charts and
identified 598 patients (90%) who completed a screening survey that was designed to identify alcoholism, the Cut
Down, Annoyed, Guilty, Eye Opener (CAGE) questionnaire, including 100 consecutive patients who had CAGE-positive and CAGE-negative results. Data on tobacco and illegal drug use, the Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale,
and the morphine equivalent daily dose were collected. RESULTS: The frequency of CAGE-positive results in this palliative care population was 100 of 598 patients (17%). Only 13 of 100 patients (13%) in that CAGE-positive group had
been identified as alcoholics before their palliative care consultation. Compared with CAGE-negative patients, CAGEpositive patients were younger (aged 58.6 years vs 61.3 years; P ¼ .07), predominantly men (68 of 100 patients vs 51
of 100 patients; P ¼ .021), more likely to have a history of tobacco use (86 of 100 patients vs 48 of 100 patients; P <
.001), more likely to be actively using nicotine (33 of 100 patients vs 9 of 100 patients; P ¼ .02), and more likely to
have a history of illegal recreational drug use (17 of 100 patients vs 1 of 100 patients; P < .001). Pain and dyspnea
were worse in patients who had a history of nicotine use. Both CAGE-positive patients and patients who had a
history of tobacco use more frequently were receiving strong opioids at the time of their palliative care consultation.
CONCLUSIONS: The current findings suggested that alcoholism is highly prevalent and frequently under diagnosed
in patients with advanced cancer. CAGE-positive patients were more likely to have a history of, or to actively
engage in, smoking and illegal recreational drug use, placing them at risk for inappropriate opioid escalation and

Alcoholism is a devastating disease that can cause suffering in both patients and their families.1,2 In the general

population, the frequency of alcoholism is approximately 8%3; however, it is often under diagnosed.4 It also has been
reported that alcoholic patients use tobacco and other illicit drugs more frequently.5 In cancer patients, alcoholism
reportedly occurs in up to 28% of patients.6,7 Previous research on the frequency of alcoholism in 2 cohorts of 100
consecutive cancer patients who were admitted to a palliative care unit indicated alcoholism rates of 28% and 27%,
respectively.7
It has been noted that patients who have a history of alcohol or drug use are susceptible to addiction when prescribed opioid analgesics8; whereas, in patients without such a history, the use of opioids to control cancer pain very
rarely results in abuse or addiction. In the United States, there is an epidemic of prescription drug abuse. In 2009,
roughly 21.8 million Americans aged 12 years used illicit drugs, including marijuana, cocaine, heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or prescription-type psychotherapeutics, for conditions other than their intended medical use.9 The
number of individuals dependent on opioid analgesics has increased from 1.5 million to 1.9 million.9 Before physicians prescribe opioid analgesics, it is imperative that a thorough assessment is conducted that includes a screen for
alcohol and drug abuse.10

In our outpatient Supportive Care Clinic, all
patients are screened routinely for alcoholism using the
Cut Down, Annoyed, Guilty, Eye Opener (CAGE) questionnaire, a 4-item survey that is a simple to administer as
a screening tool.11 This questionnaire asks the following:
•
•
•
•

Have you ever felt the need to cut down on drinking?
Have you ever felt annoyed by criticism of your
drinking?
Have you ever had guilty feelings about your drinking?
Have you ever taken a morning eye opener?

The objectives of the current study were to determine the frequency of undiagnosed alcoholism in our
patient population with advanced cancer and to study the
correlation between CAGE-positive patients (those who
answered ‘‘yes’’ to at least 2 questions on the CAGE questionnaire), a current or past history of smoking tobacco,
and the use of illegal drugs and sedatives, hypnotics, and
anxiolytics (SHA). In addition, we examined the characteristics of patients who had a history of tobacco use
with regard to demographics, symptom burden, and
opioid use.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
We previously reviewed the electronic charts of 665 consecutive patients who attended our Supportive Care
Clinic at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer
Center for the first time before January 2007 to identify
100 consecutive CAGE-positive patients.12 The CAGE
questionnaire is a simple, 4-item screening survey for alcoholism.11 Two positive answers (CAGE-positive) have
sensitivity >90% and specificity >95% to detect alcoholism13; however, this questionnaire does not distinguish
between current versus past alcohol use. For the purpose
of our study, a patient was considered CAGE-positive
when he or she answered ‘‘yes’’ to at least 2 questions.
Demographics, date of advanced cancer diagnosis, symptom scores, and opioid use also were collected for 100
consecutive CAGE-negative patients and 100 consecutive
CAGE-positive patients.12
For the current study, we retrospectively reviewed
the medical records of the previously identified 100
CAGE-positive patients and 100 CAGE-negative patients
and systematically recorded any documentation of alcoholism or alcohol abuse as noted in the electronic medical
records before the initial palliative care consultation in
our Supportive Care Clinic. A history of tobacco abuse
(including active use), any documented use of illegal drugs

4552

(marijuana, intravenous drug abuse, cocaine, etc), and 1
SHA listed in patients’ medication records at the time of
palliative care consultation were noted.
Symptoms were recorded for the initial visit to our
center using the Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scores
(ESAS), a validated tool to assess 9 symptoms (pain,
nausea, drowsiness, dyspnea, anxiety, depression, anorexia, sleep, and fatigue) and general feelings of well being
on a scale ranging from 0 to 10.14,15 A total symptom distress score (range, 0-90) is calculated as the sum of the first
9 symptom scores. The total daily opioid dosage was
calculated for the first visit by converting the total opioid
dosage during 24 hours to an equivalent dose of oral
morphine (morphine equivalent daily dose [MEDD])
using standard equianalgesic conversion tables.16
Summary statistics were generated to describe the
demographic and clinical characteristics of the patients as
well as the frequency and proportion of cancer patients
who screened positive with the CAGE questionnaire
during the study period. Variables to be analyzed included
symptom burden (as measured by the ESAS), opioid
dosage, use of tobacco or illegal recreational drug use, and
demographic variables, such as age, sex, and ethnicity. To
determine whether there were significant differences
between groups, we used a 2-sample t test when the data
were distributed approximately normally, the Wilcoxon
2-sample test if the data were skewed, and chi-square tests
for dichotomous variables.

RESULTS
CAGE information was available for 598 of 665 patients
(90%); and 100 patients had positive CAGE results
(17%). Characteristics of CAGE-negative and CAGEpositive patients are summarized in Table 1.
CAGE-positive patients were predominantly men,
and we noted a trend toward younger age. CAGE-positive
patients were significantly more likely to have a history
of tobacco abuse and active nicotine use, and they more
frequently were on strong opioids at the time of palliative
care consultation. No differences in the use of 1 SHA
were noted between the 2 groups.
Only 13 of the 100 CAGE-positive patients (13%)
had medical documentation of a history of alcohol
abuse or alcoholism before palliative care consultation
(Table 2). Four patients were identified by the consulting
psychiatric team, and 2 were identified by an oncology
fellow who was trained in palliative care and had incorporated the CAGE questionnaire into his routine clinical
assessment.

In addition, CAGE-positive patients were more
likely to have a documented history of illegal recreational
drug use (17 of 100 CAGE-positive patients vs 1 of 100
CAGE-negative patients; P < .001) (Table 2). Four of the
18 patients had a documented history of polysubstance
abuse. Of the 18 patients who had a documented history
of illegal drug use, the specific drug was noted as follows:
marijuana (11 patients), intravenous drug abuse (5
patients), cocaine (5 patients), hydrocodone addiction (1
patient), methamphetamine (1 patient), heroin (1

patient), and a history of unspecified substance abuse (1
patient).
Characteristics of patients according to their history of
tobacco use are summarized in Table 3. Men and patients
with lung tumors were significantly more likely to have a
history of tobacco use. Patients who had a history of nicotine use were more likely to be on strong opioids on initial
palliative care consultation, but no difference was noted in
the MEDD or in the frequency of being prescribed 1
SHA between the 2 groups (Table 3).
Patients who had a history of tobacco use had significantly higher pain expression and levels of dyspnea (Table 4). A nonsignificant trend toward higher fatigue also
was noted in patients who had a history of tobacco use.

DISCUSSION
The current data suggest that alcoholism frequently is
undocumented in patients with advanced cancer. In our
study, healthcare professionals had noted that only 13 of
100 (13%) CAGE-positive patients were alcoholics before
palliative care consultation. A previous study reported
that 9 of 28 patients (32%) and 8 of 24 patients (33%)

who were diagnosed as alcoholics during 1989 and 1992,
respectively, had been identified as alcoholics in the medical charts before assessment by the CAGE questionnaire.7

Alcoholism is strongly linked with other addictive
substances, including tobacco and illicit drugs,5 and the
aberrant use of these substances to help cope with life stressors is defined as chemical coping.17 Our findings suggest
that, although the vast majority of cancer patients are
started on strong opioids by their oncologist or primary
care providers, they often undergo less stringent screening
for risk factors for chemical coping. Cancer patients are
living longer, and those with chronic pain may be treated
with opioids for prolonged periods. In the past, assessment
of risk factors for addiction may have been overlooked in
patients with cancer, because it was believed they had a
short life expectancy. Identifying patients who are at risk
for chemical coping has important clinical implications,
including the need for close monitoring of opioid use, consideration for early referral to pain specialists or palliative
care physicians, and management by an interdisciplinary
team to avoid inappropriate escalation, neurotoxicity, and
side-effects of strong opioids. Before prescribing pain medications, clinicians need to carefully screen for behaviors
that place patients at risk for addiction or chemical coping,
including past history of alcohol, prescription drug, or
nonprescription drug abuse.10

Our study also reveals that CAGE-positive patients
more frequently have a history of, and are actively using,
tobacco and illegal nonprescription drugs. The relation
between smoking behavior, symptom burden, and opioid
use has not been well characterized in patients with
advanced cancer. Our findings are consistent with the
clinical observation that suggests tobacco use is associated
with higher opioid use. In addition, patients with a history
of opioid addiction reportedly had a 3-fold or greater
increased frequency of tobacco use.18
Both alcohol and nicotine are readily available and
legal. Relative to the general population, individuals who
smoke are 4 times more likely to be addicted to alcohol,
and alcoholic patients are 3 times more likely to be
dependent on nicotine.19 Alcohol and nicotine have different mechanisms of action. Although nicotine activates the
nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in specific brain regions,
whereas alcohol acts on several different molecular receptors, recent research suggests that both drugs may share the
ability to modulate the endogenous opioid system.20 A
history of abuse of either alcohol or tobacco may indicate an
individual’s predisposition to chemical coping.
In 2009, the prevalence of smoking in the general
population aged 12 years in the United State was
27.7%.8 Currently, smoking tobacco is less socially
acceptable than in years past. Recent nicotine use or active
smoking behavior may indicate a stronger risk factor for
chemical coping and addiction. In population-based studies, smokers generally report more severe, widespread pain
compared with nonsmokers.21,22 Our study confirmed
that patients who had a history of tobacco abuse had more
severe symptoms of pain and dyspnea and also were more
likely to be prescribed strong opioids before palliative
care consultation; however, the MEDD in smokers and
nonsmokers did not differ significantly.
Several studies suggest that patients who cope
chemically tend to express a higher degree of symptoms.12,23,24 In a study conducted by our group, we noted
that CAGE-positive patients were referred earlier to palliative care; were more likely to be on opioid therapy upon
referral; and had increased pain, sleep, dyspnea, decreased
well being, and total symptom distress at baseline.12 A history of both alcohol and tobacco abuse places patients at
risk for chemical coping, and health care professionals
should cautiously adjust opioid therapy based not only on
a patient’s pain expression but also on assessments of their
level of physical and mental function. It is unclear whether
or not increased ratings of symptoms by cancer patients
who have a history of substance abuse may be attributed

to central sensitization, increased nociceptive input from
the underlying cancer, or a combination of both.
The CAGE questionnaire can help screen patients
for alcoholism but is not diagnostic; for that reason,
CAGE-positive patients should undergo formal evaluation and diagnosis using Diagnostic and Statistical Manual
of Mental Disorders, fourth edition, criteria for definitive
diagnosis. Our study was a retrospective review, which
limited our ability to determine the actual frequency of
use of opioid and SHA. Therefore, our findings are
preliminary, and further prospective studies are needed to
examine the association between alcohol and tobacco use
with chemical coping in cancer patients.
In conclusion, the current data suggest that alcoholism is highly prevalent and frequently undocumented in
patients with advanced cancer. CAGE-positive patients
were more likely to have a history of, or actively engage
in, smoking and illegal recreational drug use, placing
them at risk for chemical coping. The CAGE questionnaire is a useful tool for detecting alcoholism, which often is under diagnosed. Patients with history of tobacco
abuse expressed more pain and dyspnea and were
prescribed strong opioids more frequently at their initial
palliative care consultation. Before prescribing opioids,
clinicians need to carefully screen for behaviors that place
patients at risk for chemical coping, including alcohol
and nicotine use.
