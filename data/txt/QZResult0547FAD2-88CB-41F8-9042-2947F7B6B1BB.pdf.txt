Abstract
High grade gliomas (HGG) are classiﬁed into four subgroups
based on transcriptional signatures and phenotypic characteristics. In particular, the proneural-to-mesenchymal transition
(PMT) is associated with increased malignancy, poor prognosis,
and disease recurrence, but the underlying causes of PMT are
still unclear. In this study, we investigated whether radiotherapy promotes PMT using a genetically engineered mouse model
of proneural HGG. We found that cranial ionizing radiation
induced robust and durable PMT in tumors. Additionally, we
isolated primary proneural HGG cells from mouse and human
tumors and demonstrate that radiation induced a sustained

cell-intrinsic mesenchymal transition associated with increased
invasiveness and resistance to the alkylating agent temozolomide. Expectedly, irradiation-induced PMT was also associated
with activation of the STAT3 transcription factor, and the
combination of STAT3 blockade using JAK2 inhibitors with
radiation abrogated the mesenchymal transition and extended
survival of mice. Taken together, our data suggest that clinical
JAK2 inhibitors should be tested in conjunction with radiation
in patients with proneural HGG as a new strategy for blocking
the emergence of therapy-resistant mesenchymal tumors at
relapse. Cancer Res; 75(20); 4302–11. 2015 AACR.

Introduction

Transcriptional proﬁling has categorized HGGs into distinct
groups, represented as a continuum between proneural and
mesenchymal subclasses (5–9). The mesenchymal signature correlates with poor prognosis when compared with proneural
tumors (10), and proneural tumors tend to shift to a mesenchymal signature at recurrence (5, 11–13). The proneural-to-mesenchymal transition (PMT) is enriched for genes associated with an
epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT; refs. 14, 15), and
likely represents an analogous process. Genes important in the
mesenchymal phenotype in HGGs include transcription factors
CEBPb, STAT3 (16), TAZ (17), NF-kB (10), and ID proteins (18).
Signals from the microenvironment also activate the mesenchymal phenotype, which is enriched in genes associated with
inﬂammation, necrosis, and angiogenesis (6, 10, 19).
Radiation may contribute to a PMT in glioma. Transcriptional
proﬁling of PDGFB-driven murine glioma cells isolated 6 hours
after irradiation revealed a mesenchymal shift in gene expression
(20). Although durability of radiation-induced PMT in glioma has
not been addressed in vivo, radiation of cultured human proneural
GBM cells induced a PMT that was sustained for at least 5 days (21).
If radiation therapy in patients induces a sustained mesenchymal
switch in the remaining radioresistant cells, blocking this transition
may prevent relapse, or block therapy resistance in relapsed tumors.
Here, we radiated proneural HGG in a genetically engineered
glioma mouse model, demonstrating a durable PMT. Radiationinduced PMT occurred in a cell-intrinsic manner, resulting in
increased cell motility and invasion, and was associated with
resistance to the alkylating agent temozolomide. Importantly,
STAT3 signaling was induced in radiated cells, and pharmacologic
inhibition of STAT3 using clinical agents effectively prevented PMT.
Our results suggest that radiotherapy as part of standard of care for
patients with proneural HGG may contribute to a PMT in recurrent
tumors, and that blockade of JAK2–STAT3 signaling may prevent
PMT and recurrence, increasing the survival of HGG patients.

Malignant high-grade gliomas (HGG) are highly lethal brain
tumors that include anaplastic oligodendroglioma, anaplastic
astrocytoma, and glioblastoma (GBM). The introduction of radiotherapy improved median survival of HGG patients from 6
months to one year (1, 2). In addition to radiation, multimodal
therapy includes surgical resection and systemic treatment with
alkylating agents (2–4). Despite treatment, however, patients with
HGGs invariably relapse and recurrent tumors are typically refractory to further therapies.

STAT3 Blockade Inhibits IR-Induced Glioma Mesenchymal Switch

Materials and Methods
Mice
All mouse experiments were approved by and performed
according to the guidelines of the Institutional Animal Care and
Use Committee of the University of California, San Francisco (San
Francisco, CA). Mice were genotyped by Transnetyx, Inc. ERB/
p53/ proneural HGG mice were genotyped for S100b-verbB
transgene and wild-type or null mutation of p53 using the
protocol as previous published (22, 24). GFAP-HA-V12-Ras-IRESLacZ mice were genotyped as previously published (23).
Tissue preparation
Mice were perfused transcardially using PBS followed by 4%
paraformaldehyde (PFA). Brains were harvested and incubated
overnight in 4% PFA at 4 C, and transferred to 30% sucrose at 4 C.
Brains were sectioned using a cryostat (Leica) as 30 mm freeﬂoating sections. Sections were stored in cryoprotectant solution
(25% glycerol, 25% ethylene glycol, 50% 0.1 mol/L phosphate
buffer) at 20 C until immunostaining procedure.
Immunoﬂuorescence
Free-ﬂoating sections were retrieved from cryoprotectant solution and washed 310 minutes in TBS (pH 7.4). The sections were
then incubated in blocking solution (5% donkey serum, 1% BSA,
0.3% TritonX-100) for 1 hour at room temperature. Primary
antibodies were diluted in blocking solution and incubated on
sections overnight at 4 C. Antibodies used were SOX10 (1:200;
Santa Cruz Biotechnology), PDGFRa (1:200; Cell Signaling Technology), and CD44 (1:400; BD Pharmingen). Sections were
washed in TBS, and incubated with the appropriate Alexa488
(1:400), 555 (1:400), 647 (1:200) secondary antibodies (Life
Technologies) in blocking solution for 2 hours at room temperature. The sections were washed in TBS 310 minutes (DAPI was
included in the second wash), followed by mounting with ProLong Gold antifade reagent (Life Technologies).
Imaging and quantiﬁcation
Mosaic images were acquired and tiled using the Zeiss M1
AxioImager and the Zen software. For quantiﬁcation, tumor
regions (DAPI bright) were identiﬁed, and region of interest was
determined, avoiding areas at the edge of tumor/section and
necrotic regions. The mean ﬂuorescence intensity was determined
using the image analysis tool.

Western blotting
For tissue specimens, samples were frozen in dry ice and stored
at 80 C until processed. Samples were homogenized and sonicated in cell lysis buffer (Cell Signaling Technology). For cells,
samples were washed in ice-cold PBS before lysis with cell lysis
buffer (Cell Signaling Technology). All samples were clariﬁed by
centrifugation at 16,000 rpm for 10 minutes at 4 C and quantiﬁed
using the Pierce BCA protein assay kit (Thermo Scientiﬁc). Equal
amounts of total protein lysates were loaded and resolved on a 4%
to 12% Bis-Tris Gel with MOPS Running buffer and transferred to
PVDF membranes. The membranes were blotted with antibodies
against PDGFRa, pSTAT3 (Tyr705), STAT3 (all from Cell Signaling Technology), CD44 (Thermo Scientiﬁc), SOX10 (Santa Cruz
Technologies), and GAPDH (Millipore). Bound antibodies were
detected with horseradish peroxidase-linked antibody against
mouse (Calbiochem), rabbit (Calbiochem), or goat (Santa Cruz
Technology) IgG, followed by ECL (Amersham).
Quantitative PCR analysis
Dissected tissue samples or cells were homogenized using the
QIAshredder spin column (Qiagen). Total RNA was extracted
from specimens using RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) and contaminating RNA was digested using RNase-free DNase Kit (Qiagen).
cDNA was synthesized using 500 ng total RNA using High
Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems)
or SuperScript VILO (Life Technologies). Real-time PCR was
performed with the intron-spanning primers (5 mmol/L) listed
in Table 1 and KAPA SYBR FAST ABI Prism qPCR Master Mix
(KAPA Biosystems) on a 7900 HT Fast Real-Time PCR system
(Applied Biosystems).
Allograft experiments
FVB/N recipient mice were anesthetized using Ketamine and
Xylazine. Oligodendroglioma tumor cells were dissociated with
accutase and intracranially grafted into mice using a Hamilton
syringe and stereotactic equipment. Injections were done at
coordinates 2 mm anterior and 1.5 mm lateral of the right
hemisphere relative to Bregma, at a depth of 3 mm.
Ionizing radiation
Mice and cells were placed in a cesium-137 source (J.L. Shephard & Associates) irradiator. Mice were shielded with iron collimators to focus the beam to the brain. Mice were given cranial

irradiation of single dose of 10 Gy, or 10 fractions of 2 Gy,
delivered at a rate of 5 fractions per week, 1 fraction per day for
2 weeks (total 10 Gy). Cells were irradiated using a single dose of
10 Gy.
Drug treatment
AZD1480 powder was purchased from ChemieTek and resuspended before each administration in water supplemented with
0.5% hypromellose (Sigma #H3785) and 0.1% Tween-80 (Sigma
#P4780). Brief sonication ensured a uniform suspension before
delivery to mice. Mice were given 30 mg/kg drug treatment or
vehicle by oral gavage daily for 8 days.
Flow cytometry
Cells were dissociated brieﬂy with accutase to obtain single cell
suspensions. Samples were incubated for 20 minutes on ice with
DyLight 800 viability dye (Thermo Scientiﬁc) in PBS. Cells were
washed with autoMACS buffer (PBS with BSA, EDTA, and azide)
and then incubated for 30 minutes on ice in autoMACS buffer
with 1:100 Brilliant Violet 421 anti-mouse CD140A (BD Biosciences) and 1:100 APC anti-mouse/human CD44 (Biolegend).
Cells were washed once, ﬁxed with BD cytoﬁx for 30 minutes on
ice, and washed again until analysis with an LSRII ﬂow cytometer
(BD Biosciences). For intracellular p-STAT3 staining, cells were
permeabilized with cold Perm Buffer III (BD Biosciences) for 30
minutes after ﬁxation, and then incubated with 1:10 PE antipSTAT3 (pY705) for 30 minutes. Cells were washed with autoMACS buffer once, before ﬂow analysis.
CyQuant proliferation assay
Five-day post-irradiated (or control) cells were plated at 3,000
cells per well in 96-well polyornithine/laminin coated plates in
NB media. Temozolomide (100mmol/L) was added a day after
plating, and DNA content was analyzed 4 days later, using the
CyQuant NF proliferation assay (Life Technologies), as previously
described (24). Fluorescent dye labels DNA that gives an indirect
measure of the number of cells.
2D motility
Cells were seeded on laminin-coated glass coverslips and subjected to ionizing radiation (IR). Four days following IR, the
coverslips were then mounted on custom-built microscope-compatible imaging chambers and cells were imaged on a Nikon
Eclipse Ti-E base microscope equipped with the Yokogawa CSUX1 confocal scanner and Andor's iXon3 EMCCD camera. Brightﬁeld images were captured every 15 minutes over 8 hours. Cell
migration time course images were compiled and cell speed was
analyzed on a single cell basis with ImageJ Software (NIH) and
Manual Tracking plugin (Fabrice P. Cordelieres, Institut Curie,
Orsay, France).
3D neurosphere invasion
Cells were seeded on nonadherent plates and subjected to
IR. Four days following IR, tumorspheres were embedded in
3D Matrigel gels (BD Biosciences) and mounted on custombuilt microscope-compatible imaging chambers and imaged
on a Nikon Eclipse Ti-E base microscope equipped with the
Yokogawa CSU-X1 confocal scanner and Andor's iXon3
EMCCD camera. Brightﬁeld images were captured every 30
minutes over 24 hours. Invasion areas were identiﬁed and
quantiﬁed using ImageJ Software (NIH).

4304 Cancer Res; 75(20) October 15, 2015

Cellular rheology
Cells were sparsely seeded on laminin-coated glass coverslips
and subjected to IR. Four days following IR, atomic force
microscopy measurements were performed directly on single
cells using an Asylum MFP 3D BIO inverted optical atomic
force microscope mounted on a Nikon TE2000-U inverted
ﬂuorescent microscope (Asylum Research). Cellular rheology
(Young's modulus) was determined by nano-indenting single
cells with low force (below 2 nN) to ensure shallow cell
indentation using calibrated Si3N4 cantilevers (60 mN/nm)
modiﬁed with a 5-mm borosilicate microsphere (Novascan
Tech.). The resulting force-distance curves were used to derive
the elastic modulus of cells by ﬁtting Hertz model to the curves
with the Igor Pro AFM Software.
Statistical analysis
Statistical tests were performed using GraphPad Prism v6.0
software. Statistical analyses for experiments with two groups
were performed using Student t test. Statistical analyses for experiments with more than two groups were performed using one-way
ANOVA with Tukey multiple comparisons test. Kaplan–Meier
survival analysis was conducted and the P value of the comparison
between survival curves was determined to be signiﬁcant by the
log-rank (Mantel–Cox) test.

Results
Oligodendroglial progenitor cell-derived HGG has proneural
character
To study the effects of radiation on murine gliomas, we ﬁrst
compared protein and gene expression in tumors arising in two
genetically engineered mouse models for glioma (22, 23). We
chose a mouse model (ERB/p53/) predisposed to oligodendroglioma (22), the most proneural of gliomas (8), that we previously showed is derived from oligodendroglial progenitor
cells (OPC; ref. 24). We compared the ERB/p53/ tumors to
those of an astrocyte-derived model for glioma driven by GFAPHRASV12D(G-RAS; refs. 23, 25). Gliomas mutant for isocitrate
dehydrogenase 1/2 (IDH1/2) do not undergo a mesenchymal
transition (11), and ERB/p53/ tumors are wild-type for IDH1
(data not shown). Immunoﬂuorescent staining of ERB/p53/
tumors showed high levels of SOX10 and PDGFRa proteins,
known markers of OPCs and human proneural HGGs (6, 26),
compared with the low levels observed in the G-RAS model
(Fig. 1A and B). Levels of the cell surface glycoprotein CD44, a
marker of human mesenchymal HGGs (6, 10), were signiﬁcantly
lower in ERB/p53/ versus G-RAS gliomas (Fig. 1A and B). Preparation of whole brain protein lysates from tumor-bearing animals demonstrated that CD44-expressing mesenchymal (G-RAS)
gliomas also showed increased abundance of phosphorylated
STAT3, a known driver of PMT (16), relative to PDGFRa-expressing proneural HGGs (Fig. 1C).
RT-PCR of RNA from tumors conﬁrmed higher expression of
Sox10 and Pdgfra mRNAs in proneural HGGs compared with
mesenchymal tumors and normal wild-type (WT) brain (Fig.
1D). Relative mRNA expression for known markers of human
mesenchymal tumors (CD44, vimentin (Vim), and Tgfb1, Chitinase-3-like protein 1 (Chi3l1 – mouse homologue for the
human YKL-40 gene) and Podoplanin (Pdpn; ref. 6) was elevated in mesenchymal murine gliomas compared with both
proneural tumors and WT mouse brain (Fig. 1D and

To better model the radiation regimen of patients, we also
irradiated symptomatic mice with 5 consecutive daily doses of
fractionated radiation (2 Gy) each week for 2 weeks. Fractionated
radiation led to improvement in median survival (81.5 vs. 60
days; Supplementary Fig. S2B). Similar to a single 10 Gy dose of
radiation, tumors treated with fractionated radiation showed
increased levels of SOX10 and PDGFRa proteins, and decreased
levels of CD44 (Supplementary Fig. S2C).
Irradiation induces a sustained cell-intrinsic PMT in
HGG Cells
Both cell-intrinsic changes as well as extrinsic cues from the
tumor microenvironment can induce a PMT in glioma (10, 21).
To determine whether radiation-induced PMT occurs in a cellintrinsic manner, we isolated tumor cells from mice with proneural HGGs, and irradiated low-passage tumor cells in vitro.
Immunoblotting and real-time PCR analyses revealed a PMT
starting 3 days after irradiation (Supplementary Fig. S3A and
S3B). On the basis of these results, we subsequently analyzed
tumor cells at 5 days after irradiation. RT-PCR analysis showed

signiﬁcant upregulation of a panel of mesenchymal genes (CD44,
Tgfb1, Fn1, Chi3l1, Vim, Slug, Snail, Twist) in irradiated murine
proneural HGG cells 5 days following radiation (10 Gy), compared with nonirradiated controls (Fig. 3A). Consistent with
observations by others (21), we demonstrated that radiation of
proneural human GBM cells led to reduced expression of SOX10
and increased expression of CD44 mRNAs (Supplementary Fig.
S3C). To conﬁrm that a homogenous population of PDGFRaþ
tumor cells shows a similar response to irradiation, we acutely
sorted PDGFRaþ cells isolated from a murine proneural HGG
tumor and subjected these cells to irradiation. Immunoblotting
results veriﬁed that, similar to heterogeneous proneural tumor
cultures, we observed increased STAT3 activation and reduced
levels of PDGFRa in irradiated cells compared with nonirradiated
cells (Supplementary Fig. S3D). These data demonstrate that
radiation induces a cell-intrinsic PMT in mouse and human
proneural HGG cells and that PDGFRaþ tumor cells alone can
undergo a PMT.
We next conducted a 2-week time course analysis by ﬂow
cytometry, using PDGFRa and CD44 as markers of proneural
and mesenchymal phenotypes, respectively. Irradiated murine
HGG cells maintained a high fraction of CD44þ cells and a low

radiation-induced PMT is maintained durably over time.
Radiation-induced PMT is associated with therapy resistance
To determine whether proneural HGG cells undergoing PMT
display increased invasion, we measured migration and 3D invasion of cells following radiation. Mouse and human proneural
HGG cells were exposed to a single dose of radiation, and
mounted onto chambers for time-lapse imaging 4 days following
irradiation. Irradiated proneural HGG cells undergoing PMT
showed higher motility than nonirradiated cells (Fig. 4A). Similarly, irradiated cells were allowed to form tumorspheres, and
embedded in Matrigel 4 days after irradiation to measure invasiveness. Proneural HGG tumorspheres exposed to radiation were
more invasive than nonirradiated tumorspheres (Fig. 4B). Using
atomic force microscopy, we found that irradiated mouse and
human HGG cells displayed reduced cellular stiffness 4 days
following radiation, compared with nonirradiated control cells
(Supplementary Fig S4A).
To study temozolomide resistance following radiation, proneural murine and human HGG cells were subjected to a single
dose of radiation, equal numbers of live cells were replated 4 days
after irradiation, incubated with temozolomide (100 mmol/L)

and proliferation was measured using a CyQuant proliferation
assay. As expected, irradiated cells demonstrated reduced proliferation compared with nonirradiated control cells (Supplementary Fig. S4B). Importantly, mouse and human HGG cells postirradiation displayed temozolomide resistance compared with
nonirradiated control cells (Fig. 4C). These results suggest that
resistance to temozolomide and reduced cellular stiffness in postirradiated mesenchymal tumor cells enable survival and migration in the tumor microenvironment, promoting malignant progression and recurrence.
STAT3 as a driver of radiation-induced PMT in HGG
STAT3 is a master regulator of the glioma mesenchymal transcriptional network in human HGGs (16), and activated STAT3
drives tumorigenicity and self-renewal of GBM cancer stem cells
(27, 28). Primary cultures from three murine HGGs and a human
proneural GBM showed increased levels of phosphorylated
STAT3 (Fig. 5A) at 5 days following radiation. Levels of proneural
proteins PDGFRa and SOX10 showed a corresponding decrease,
consistent with a PMT (Fig. 5A).
We next investigated whether the activation of STAT3 was
durable. Phospho-ﬂow analysis of cells 5 days after irradiation
showed increased levels of phosphorylated STAT3, consistent with
immunoblotting results. The increased level of phosphorylated

Pharmacologic inhibition of JAK2–STAT3 signaling prevents
PMT in HGG cultures
The transient nature of STAT3 phosphorylation in response
to radiation raises questions as to whether STAT3 is a driver of
PMT in response to radiation. JAK2 phosphorylates and activates
STAT3 (29). The JAK2 inhibitor AZD1480 and the dual JAK1/2
inhibitor ruxolitinib (INCB018424) have been tested in clinical
trials and shown to block down-stream activation of STAT3
(30–32). To assess pharmacologic blockade of STAT3 phosphorylation, we ﬁrst incubated murine proneural HGG cells with
increasing doses of AZD1480 (0.5–2.0 mmol/L) or ruxolitinib
(0.25–2.0 mmol/L), stimulating STAT3 signaling with 10 ng/mL
oncostatin M 15 minutes before cell harvest (Supplementary Fig.
S5B). AZD1480 and ruxolitinib signiﬁcantly inhibited STAT3
phosphorylation at 1.0 and 0.5 mmol/L, respectively. A similar
experiment conducted by incubating murine proneural HGG cells
with each inhibitor for 5 days demonstrated a sustained inhibition of STAT3 activation for 5 days after treatment (Supplementary Fig. S5C).
Treatment of cells with either JAK inhibitor, in combination
with radiation, prevented PMT 5 days after irradiation. Immunoblotting showed that irradiated cells treated with AZD1480

or ruxolitinib had a corresponding rescue of SOX10 protein
levels (Fig. 5B and Supplementary Fig. S5D). Using the more
speciﬁc JAK2 inhibitor AZD1480, we found that cells treated
with AZD1480 in combination with radiation failed to
increase mesenchymal gene expression compared with control
irradiated cells not treated with AZD1480 (Fig. 5C). Combination treatment of AZD1480 with radiation also abrogated
the invasiveness of radiated human GBM5 tumorspheres (Fig.
5D). To study the in vivo survival beneﬁt of combination
treatment of AZD1480 and radiation, we allografted PDGFRaþ
proneural HGG cells into cohorts of FVB/N mice. Irradiated
mice showed a survival beneﬁt compared with nonirradiated
mice (P < 0.001). Furthermore, an additional 8-day treatment
regimen with AZD1480 (30 mg/kg/d) resulted in a signiﬁcant
extension of survival compared with irradiation alone (P <
0.01; Fig. 5E). These results show that pharmacologic inhibition of JAK2 effectively reduces phosphorylation of STAT3,
associated with blockade of radiation-induced PMT in murine
proneural HGG cells.

Discussion
Despite aggressive treatment, patients with HGGs invariably
relapse, and prognosis remains dismal. Recurrent tumors are
often refractory to further therapy, showing both a high degree
of invasiveness and a shift to a mesenchymal gene signature.
Radiation remains an integral part of standard of care in HGG

patients. Does radiation as a treatment contribute to recurrence
and increased aggressiveness in tumors at relapse?
Using a genetically engineered model for proneural HGG, we
show that radiation induces a robust and durable PMT in vivo.
Oligodendroglioma represents the most proneural of gliomas (8),
hence we chose a mouse model for oligodendroglioma for these
studies. Nevertheless, to extend our ﬁndings to human proneural
glioma, we show similar results in a primary culture from a human
proneural glioma (GBM5 cells), also conﬁrming results of a
previous study (21).
Components of the tumor microenvironment have been suggested to promote a mesenchymal signature (6). Areas of higher
necrosis are associated with more mesenchymal character (19),
and microglia/macrophages have been proposed as a source of
TNFa paracrine signaling to tumor cells (10). In previous studies,
tumor cells isolated after irradiation in vivo showed a PMT on a
transcriptional level (20), but it remains unclear whether PMT
induction was due to the tumor microenvironment interactions

or was cell-intrinsic. Although our results demonstrate that exposing isolated primary tumor cells to radiation induces a cellintrinsic PMT, they do not exclude the possibility that tumor
microenvironment components can modulate the mesenchymal
phenotype.
Prior analyses of the radiation-induced PMT were limited to 6
hours for mouse HGGs in vivo (20) and 5 days for human GBM
cells in vitro (21). We demonstrate a durable PMT at 2 weeks
following radiation of proneural murine HGG in vivo and in vitro.
Furthermore, we demonstrated that the mesenchymal transition
was associated with temozolomide resistance, increased invasiveness, and reduced cell stiffness, ﬁndings also observed in human
proneural GBM5 cells. Thus, radiation treatment may drive a
mesenchymal signature associated with treatment resistance and
increased invasiveness at relapse.
We also identiﬁed STAT3 as a driver for radiation-induced
PMT, supporting previous ﬁndings that STAT3 is a master regulator
of the mesenchymal transcriptional network (16). Interestingly,

phosphorylation of STAT3 occurred transiently in irradiated tumor
cells that nevertheless showed sustained expression of the mesenchymal transcriptional network. Because HGG patients receive 6
weeks of fractionated radiation, this transient activation of STAT3
may be repeated at each cycle, conceivably expanding a population
of radioresistant cells with a therapy-resistant mesenchymal phenotype. Aldehyde dehydrogenase has also been implicated in PMT
in glioma cells (21); however, there are currently no selective ALDH
antagonists available for clinical use (33).
To assess STAT3 as a driver of radiation-induced PMT, we tested
pharmacologic inhibition of JAK2 to determine whether blockade
of downstream STAT3 signaling could prevent radiation-induced
PMT. We showed that blockade of STAT3 activation before, and
concurrent with radiotherapy was effective in blocking the mesenchymal transition in glioma cells, and conferred survival beneﬁt
in mice with proneural HGG tumors. Therefore, our study suggests that inhibitors of JAK2 may block radiation-induced PMT in
patients receiving radiation therapy for HGG.
