Abstract
Twenty-five percent of all lung cancer cases are not
attributable to smoking. Epidermal growth factor receptor
(EGFR) mutations, which are involved in f50% of nonsmoker
lung cancer, are positively correlated with responsiveness to
gefitinib, and inversely correlated with smoking history. Activating EGFR mutations play a critical role in the carcinogenesis of nonsmoking-related lung cancer. To investigate the
chemopreventive effects of gefitinib on nonsmoking-related
lung cancer, we generated transgenic mice expressing EGFR
L858R in type II pneumocytes constitutively using the surfactant protein-C promoter. The transgenic mice invariably
developed atypical adenomatous hyperplasia at age 4 weeks
and multifocal adenocarcinoma of varying sizes at age
7 weeks. Notably, the expression levels of phosphorylated
and total ErbB2, ErbB3, and thyroid transcription factor-1
were elevated in the transgenic mice compared with wild-type
controls at age 3 weeks. Administration of gefitinib to 3-weekold transgenic mice for 1 week before carcinogenesis reduced
the amount of phosphorylated EGFR in the lungs of the mice
to the baseline level. Gefitinib (5 mg/kg/d; n = 5, 5, and 15)
or vehicle (n = 5, 5, and 15) was administered to transgenic
mice from age 3 to 8, 13, and 18 weeks, respectively. The
numbers of lung tumors in the control and gefitinib-treated
groups were 1.75, 5.8, 10.2, and 0 (P < 0.05), respectively. No
fatal toxic events occurred in either group, and gefitinib
inhibited tumorigenesis completely in this mouse model.
These results suggest the utility of molecular targeted
chemoprevention against nonsmoking-related lung cancer.

Introduction
Age-adjusted mortality rates for lung cancer have begun to decline in the United States and Japan due to intensive antismoking campaigns (1). However, an estimated 15% of men and 53% of

women with lung cancer worldwide are lifelong nonsmokers (2).
In Japan, f30% of the male and 70% of the female patients with
lung cancer were found to have no history of smoking (3). In
addition, ethnically Asian people are relatively more resistant to the
carcinogenic effects of tobacco smoke compared with African
Americans or Caucasians (4). Note that lung cancer in lifelong
nonsmokers is the seventh most common cause of cancer-related
death worldwide, ahead of cervical, pancreatic, and prostate cancers (5). Consequently, nonsmoking-related lung cancer will become an increasingly important issue in the future.
Recent advances in lung cancer research have raised the
possibility of a molecular-based method for classifying tumors
[e.g., epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and KRAS mutationrelated lung cancers; ref. 6] that could replace the older WHO/
International Association Society of Lung Cancer system, which
is based on tumor morphology. Tumor biology and pathogenesis
are reportedly different between smoking- and nonsmoking-related
lung cancers (7).
To date, most chemopreventive studies of lung cancer have
targeted factors that were related to smoking. In addition, no
clinical trials or preclinical studies have investigated specific
molecules associated with the pathogenesis of lung cancer (8, 9).
Preclinical studies generally rely on mice sensitive to the carcinogens in tobacco smoke, such as 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3pyridyl)-1-butanone and benzo[a] pyrene, as a smoking-related
lung cancer model, and the majority of tumors in these mice
contain point mutations in K-ras (10–12). We and other groups
have achieved major, and sometimes complete, success in preventing smoking-related tumorigenesis using chemopreventive agents
such as epigallocatechin gallate and cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors (13–15). Similar results have been obtained using gefitinib,
an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI; refs. 16, 17); however, the
inhibitory effect was weaker than expected because EGFR is not
closely associated with tumorigenic signaling in smoking-related
lung cancer (16, 17). In contrast, no previous chemopreventive
studies have reported on nonsmoking-related lung cancer.
In patients with lung cancer, the presence of EGFR mutations
is strongly associated with a history of never smoking cigarettes
(18–20), Asian ethnicity, and female gender (20, 21). In addition,
transfection with mutated EGFR can transform NIH3T3 or HBECS
cells to show EGF-independent growth (22, 23), but wild-type EGFR
shows no such effect (24). Consistent with these observations, we
and two other groups revealed the essential role of EGFR mutations in lung carcinogenesis using transgenic mice. Specifically,
activating EGFR mutations in the mice induced lung adenocarcinoma, which up-regulated EGFR signaling (25–27); however, wildtype EGFR induced only minor pathologic changes in the lungs of

mice (25). Thus, activating EGFR mutations appear to play a critical role in the carcinogenesis of nonsmoking-related lung cancer.
Approximately 90% of the activating EGFR mutations identified
in these studies involved deletions in exon 19 and the substitution
of arginine for leucine at codon 858 (L858R; refs. 6, 20). These
mutations were also positively correlated with an improved clinical
response to treatment with gefitinib or erlotinib, a reversible EGFR
TKI (28, 29). The binding strength of gefitinib to the ATP-binding
pocket in EGFR is f20-fold higher for mutated EGFR L858R
than for wild-type EGFR; in contrast, the binding of ATP to the
ATP-binding pocket in EGFR is 5-fold lower for mutated EGFR
than for wild-type EGFR. Consequently, gefitinib inhibits the
activity of the kinase more strongly and efficiently in mutated
EGFR than in wild-type EGFR (30). Therefore, activating EGFR
mutations may be excellent molecular targets for chemoprevention
of nonsmoking-related lung cancer.
Here, we report the establishment of a nonsmoking-related lung
cancer mouse model for use in chemopreventive studies. In this
model, mice expressing EGFR L858R died due to lung tumors at
age f30 weeks if left untreated with gefitinib. Using this model,
we analyzed the molecular targeted chemopreventive effect of
gefitinib on tumorigenesis in nonsmoking-related lung cancer.

Materials and Methods
Production of transgenic mice. To generate mice constitutively
expressing mutant human EGFR in the lung, we used the surfactant
protein-C promoter, which is active only in type II alveolar epithelial cells
(31). The plasmid containing the surfactant protein-C promoter and SV40
small T intron and polyadenylation sequence was described previously (31).
Full-length cDNA encoding human EGFR tagged at the COOH-terminal end
with FLAG was inserted into the plasmid between the surfactant protein-C
promoter and SV40 small T intron. The entire sequence of the construct
was subsequently confirmed by sequencing. Next, a point mutation, L858R,
was introduced using a QuikChange XL kit (Stratagene) in accordance with
the manufacturer’s instructions. The EGFR expression cassette was then
excised from the parental vector using Hind III and Not I and injected into
fertilized C57BL/6Cr eggs (Japan SLC).
Animal husbandry and gefitinib treatment. All animals were kept
under pathogen-free conditions and provided with food and water ad
libitum as specified in the guidelines of the Department of Animal
Resources of Okayama University Advanced Science Research Center.
Gefitinib kindly provided by AstraZeneca UK was given once a day,
5 days/wk, by gavage as a 5 mg/kg suspension. The suspension was
prepared in 1% polysorbate 80 by homogenization and ball-milled with glass
beads for 24 h. All procedures were done in accordance with institutional
guidelines for the care and use of experimental animals.
PCR genotyping. Genomic DNA was isolated from the tails of the mice
using a QIAamp DNA Mini kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. Transgenic lines were identified by PCR using primers specific
for human EGFR (human EGFR-F1 5¶-GGCACGGTGTAAGGGACTC-3¶ and
human EGFR-R1 5¶-CAAACGGTCACCCCGTAGCTCCAGA-3¶). The amplified
products were resolved by electrophoresis on 1.6% agarose gels.
Histology and immunohistochemistry. The animals were killed by
cervical dislocation, and the lungs were then excised. The left lung was
flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen for molecular analysis, and the right lung was
inflated with 10% paraformaldehyde in PBS. The right lung was stained with
each antibody as described previously (27). Briefly, sections were incubated
with the primary antibody (1:50 dilution) at 4jC for 12 h followed by 30 min
incubation with EnVision+ System–labeled polymer-horseradish peroxidase
anti-rabbit (DAKO). Sections were stained with 3,3¶-diaminobenzidine
chromogen and counterstained with Mayer’s hematoxylin. Rabbit polyclonal
anti-EGFR antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and anti-phosphorylated
EGFR Y1068, phosphorylated Akt, total Akt, phosphorylated mitogenactivated protein kinase (MAPK), and total MAPK (Cell Signaling Tech-

nology) were used as the primary antibodies. Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) was detected using a PCNA Staining kit (Zymed Laboratories).
Real-time PCR and quantitative PCR analysis. RNA samples were
prepared using the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol, and cDNA was synthesized using SuperScript II reverse
transcriptase (Invitrogen). Primers human EGFR-F1 and human EGFR-R1
were then used to specifically amplify the mutant human EGFR. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was amplified as a control
using primers GAPDH-F (5¶-CGTAGACAAAATGGTGAAGG-3¶) and GAPDHR (5¶-GTTGTCATGGATGACCTTGG-3¶). Quantitative PCR was done by monitoring in real-time the increase in fluorescence of SYBR Green dye (Qiagen)
with an ABI 5700 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems). Amplification of the total EGFR transcript level and copy number including both
the endogenous mouse EGFR and the mutant human EGFR were determined
by quantitative real-time PCR (RT-PCR) using the following primers having a
highly similar sequence to amplify the exon 15 region from both human and
mouse EGFR loci as described by Ji and colleagues (26). GAPDH was
coamplified in the same reaction mixture as an endogenous reference gene
using GAPDH. The average level of EGFR expression and the copy number
were determined from the differences in the threshold amplification cycles
between EGFR and GAPDH.
Immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation. Proteins were extracted
and transferred as described previously (27). Briefly after quantification by a
protein assay (Bio-Rad), f50 Ag aliquots of each extract were separated by
SDS-PAGE using precast 5% to 15% gels (Bio-Rad) and transferred onto
nitrocellulose membranes. For immunoprecipitation, the cells were lysed in
0.1% Triton [0.1% Triton X-100, 20 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mmol/L
NaCl, 1 mmol/L EDTA, 1 mmol/L EGTA, 10 mmol/L h-glycerophosphate,
10 mmol/L NaF, and 1 mmol/L sodium orthovanadate containing protease
inhibitors], subsequently sonicated, and incubated with an appropriate
antibody overnight at 4jC. The immunoprecipitates were collected using
anti-FLAG affinity gel (Sigma). Specific proteins were detected by enhanced
chemiluminescence (GE Healthcare) using antibodies against the following:
phosphorylated EGFR Y1068, total EGFR, phosphorylated Akt, total Akt,
phosphorylated MAPK, total MAPK, pMet, phosphorylated insulin-like
growth factor-I receptor (IGF-IR), and total IGF-IR (1:1,000 dilution; Cell
Signaling Technology); phosphorylated ErbB2 and phosphorylated ErbB3
(1:1,000 dilution; Cell Signaling Technology); ErbB2 and ErbB3 (1:1,000
dilution; Upstate Biotechnology); total Met and thyroid transcription factor1 (TTF-1; 1:200 dilution; Santa Cruz Biotechnology); actin (1:5,000 dilution;
Chemicon); and FLAG (1:1,000 dilution; Sigma). The secondary antibodies
were anti-rabbit IgG (horseradish peroxidase–linked, species-specific whole
antibody) and anti-mouse IgG (horseradish peroxidase–linked, speciesspecific whole antibody; GE Healthcare), both of which were used at a
1:5,000 dilution.
Experimental design. Fifty 3-week-old transgenic mice were divided
into two groups treated with either gefitinib (n = 25) or vehicle (n = 25) for
5, 10, and 15 weeks. At age 8, 13, and 18 weeks, 5, 5, and 15 mice,
respectively, were killed in each group. The diameter of superficial lung
tumors was measured with an Absolute Coolant Proof Caliper (Mitutoyo)
using a megaloscope and the tumor number of the left lung per mouse (long
axis exceeding 1 mm) was counted.
Statistical analysis. Tumor incidence and proportions of EGFR- and
PCNA-positive cells were analyzed by the Mann-Whitney test. Changes in
body weight were analyzed by paired t test. Statistical significance was
defined as P < 0.05. All statistical analyses were carried out using SPSS
version 10.0 (SPSS).

Results
Production of transgenic mice. We mutated a single
nucleotide in human EGFR known to be substituted in patients
with lung cancer (EGFR L858R) to generate a mutant EGFR-FLAG
construct consisting of the surfactant protein-C promoter, open
reading frame of the mutated EGFR-FLAG, SV40 small T intron,
and SV40 polyadenylation signal (Fig. 1A). Following injection of

the construct into fertilized eggs, 27 pups were born and examined
for integration of the transgene by PCR using tail genomic DNA.
Of these, eight mice were positive and two (3-6 and 4-3) later
developed lung adenocarcinoma. Subsequently, lines 3-6 and 4-3
produced offspring, each of which developed lung tumors at age
z7 weeks. However, transgenic line 3-6 mice were lost because of
mating error. No lung tumors were detected in any of the other
mice until age 30 weeks. We attempted to produce transgenic mice
expressing human EGFR delE746-A750 at the same time but failed
to generate a founder.
Analysis of copy number and expression of the transgene.
RT-PCR using tail genomic DNA from heterozygous transgenic
mice showed an f1.5- to 3-fold greater expression of the transgene
compared with endogenous Egfr in mice of transgenic lines 3-6 and
4-3 (Fig. 1B). Immunoblotting using multiple tissues from 7-weekold transgenic (line 4-3) and control mice using anti-FLAG
antibodies indicated that mutant EGFR expression was restricted
to the lung tissue of the transgenic mice (Fig. 1C, a). In addition,
the presence of the point mutation in the lung tissue of the
transgenic mice was confirmed by direct sequencing of the RT-PCR
products (Fig. 1C, b).

We then evaluated EGFR expression in the lungs of 3-week-old
transgenic mice showing no overt signs of lung tumors by Western
blotting. The level of EGFR expression in the lungs of the
transgenic mice was significantly higher than that in the lungs of
the control mice (Fig. 1D, a). We also evaluated the levels of
phosphorylated and total ErbB2, ErbB3, Met, IGF-IR, Akt, MAPK,
and TTF-1 in the same manner. The transgenic mice expressed
more phosphorylated ErbB2, ErbB3, Akt, MAPK, and TTF-1 in
their lungs than did the control mice, but Met and IGF-IR was
not activated in the transgenic mice compared with controls
(Fig. 1D, a). In addition, we consistently detected numerous
alveolar epithelial cells expressing high levels of EGFR in the
lungs of the 3-week-old transgenic mice by immunohistochemistry
(Supplementary Fig. S1A). The expression levels of EGFR mRNA
were examined by SYBR Green RT-PCR. The transgenic lines 3-6
and 4-3 mice with multiple lung tumors expressed 10 to 30 times
more EGFR in their lungs than the normal nontransgenic controls
(Fig. 1D, b). These observations suggest an increase in the number
of cells expressing mutated EGFR during tumor development.

Chemoprevention of Nonsmoker Lung Cancer

transgenic mice from line 4-3 and control mice were killed at
various time points for pathologic examination. Histologic changes
consistent with human bronchioloalveolar carcinoma were observed at age 4 to 5 weeks (Supplementary Fig. S1D, c and d). At age
7 weeks, we observed adenocarcinoma with solid features similar
to human adenocarcinoma (Supplementary Fig. S1D, e and f ),
and the tumors continued to progress (Supplementary Fig. S1D,
g and h). The tumors showed strong immunoreactivity with antitotal and phosphorylated EGFR, Akt, and MAPK antibodies
(Supplementary Fig. S1A and C). Ultimately, the mice died at age
f30 weeks if left untreated with gefitinib. Macroscopically,
we found multiple nodules on the lung surface (Supplementary
Fig. S1D, i), although metastatic lesions were not detected in any
other organ. In marked contrast, no lung tumors developed in the
control mice, and all of the controls survived for >1 year.
To test for increased cellular proliferation caused by the transgene,
we used PCNA staining in successive specimens taken from the
lungs of the transgenic mice. No significant differences were observed
in the number of PCNA-positive cells between wild-type and transgenic mice before lung tumor development (age 3 weeks; Supplementary Fig. S1B, a and b; data not shown). However, beginning at
4 weeks, the number of PCNA-positive cells, most of which seemed
to be tumor cells, markedly increased in the transgenic mice (Supplementary Fig. S1B, c and d). Moreover, the tumors observed at 15 weeks
were highly positive for PCNA (Supplementary Fig. S1B, e and f ).
Crosstalk of ectopic human EGFR with endogenous signaling protein in mice. Immunoprecipitation by the FLAG protein
tagged in human EGFR at the COOH-terminal end using lung tissue
from 7-week-old transgenic with or without gefitinib treatment
indicated that ectopic human EGFR colocalized with endogenous
ErbB2, ErbB3, and p85, a subunit of phosphoinositide 3-kinase
(Supplementary Fig. S2). These results suggested that crosstalk
between ectopic human EGFR and endogenous signaling proteins
may occur in the transgenic mice.
Chemopreventive effect of gefitinib on activating EGFR
mutation-induced lung adenocarcinoma. We first investigated
the inhibitory effects of gefitinib on EGFR phosphorylation in lung
tissue taken from the transgenic mice before tumor formation.
Gefitinib or vehicle alone was administered to transgenic mice at
age 3 weeks by gavage as a 5 mg/kg suspension for 5 days. Staining with H&E versus that with PCNA showed no significant
difference; however, staining for EGFR indicated that the level of
pneumocyte expression of EGFR was slightly higher in the control
group than in the gefitinib-treated group (Fig. 2A). In addition,
Western blotting confirmed that the levels of total and phosphorylated EGFR were greater in the lungs of the transgenic mice than
in those of the wild-type mice and that gefitinib reduced the
phosphorylation of EGFR before carcinogenesis (Fig. 2B).
We next investigated the effects of gefitinib on tumor number,
results of histologic analysis of the lung, and body weight in
3-week-old transgenic mice treated with gefitinib or vehicle alone
for 5 weeks (n = 5), 10 weeks (n = 5), and 15 weeks (n = 15),
respectively. The numbers F SE of superficial left lung tumors with
a long axis exceeding 1 mm in the control and gefitinib-treated
groups were 1.75 F 1.5 and 0 (P < 0.05), 5.8 F 2.17 and 0 (P < 0.005),
and 10.2 F 2.44 and 0 (P < 0.001), respectively (Mann-Whitney
test; Fig. 3A). Gefitinib prevented lung tumorigenesis completely.
When treated with gefitinib, lung tumors were not detected either
macroscopically (Fig. 3A) or histologically (Fig. 3B) at three points.
The body weight of each animal was determined every week,
but no significant difference was detected between the two groups

(P = 0.971, paired t test; Fig. 3C). We found no skin rash, diarrhea,
or interstitial lung disease in either group.
We next used EGFR and PCNA immunostaining to analyze the
lungs of the animals in the two groups. Multiple tumors with
strongly EGFR- and PCNA-positive cells were detected in the
control group, whereas largely normal tissues with weakly EGFRand PCNA-positive cells were seen in the gefitinib group (Fig. 4A).
That gefitinib reduced the level of EGFR phosphorylation in the
gefitinib group was confirmed by Western blotting (Fig. 4C). EGFRand PCNA-positive and EGFR- and PCNA-negative cells were
counted 10 times (1,000-fold view fields) in five transgenic mice and
the ratio of EGFR- and PCNA-positive cells (number of EGFR- and
PCNA-positive cells / number of cells counted  100) was
calculated. The ratios F SE of EGFR- and PCNA-positive cells in
the gefitinib group versus the control group were 48.6 F 1.5%
versus 4.7 F 0.72% (P < 0.001, Mann-Whitney test) and 72.3 F
1.77% versus 30.7 F 1.81% (P < 0.001, Mann-Whitney test),
respectively. EGFR- and PCNA-positive cell numbers decreased

significantly in the gefitinib group compared with the control
group (Fig. 4B).
Finally, we investigated whether the effect of gefitinib was
temporary in transgenic mice treated with gefitinib for 15 weeks
after a 1-week follow-up period (n = 3). Tumors were detected in the
lungs of the mice, similar to the control transgenic mice. Notably, at
1 week after stopping gefitinib treatment, we detected the
reexpansion of the tumor cells (data not shown) because gefitinib
is a reversible EGFR TKI; however, other growth signals may be
associated with regrowth. Recently, Met and/or IGF-IR activation
were reported as the reasons for acquired resistance to gefitinib
(32, 33). In these transgenic mice treated with 5 mg/kg gefitinib for
15 weeks (Fig. 4D) and then discontinued gefitinib for 1 week, Met,
IGF-IR, and ErbB3 status were not activated (data not shown).

Discussion
In the present study, we found that gefitinib completely inhibited
tumorigenesis in EGFR L858R transgenic mice. This nonsmoking-

related lung cancer mouse model is the first chemopreventive
paradigm that does not involve induction of tumorigenesis by
specific carcinogens found in tobacco smoke. In addition, our
results showed that a molecular targeted agent can inhibit specific
oncogene-induced carcinogenesis completely.
Human EGFR was overexpressed, but ectopic human EGFR
could show crosstalk with endogenous ErbB2, ErbB3, and p85 and
also activate Akt or MAPK in the lungs of the transgenic mice.
Constitutive human EGFR activation could induce lung adenocarcinoma in the mice because EGFR inhibition resulted in complete
tumor prevention. Sato and colleagues reported that the EGFR
mutation alone was not sufficient for acquisition of fully malignant
phenotype (23). Our transgenic mice showed no distant metastasis
in other organs (e.g., brain and liver) when mice died due to lung
tumors at f30 weeks. These observations suggest that activating
EGFR mutations play a critical role in tumorigenesis, although further genetic alterations were needed to obtain the fully malignant
phenotype (34). The majority of patients with lung cancer having
activating EGFR mutations also show high copy numbers of EGFR

(19). Thus, EGFR mutations and overexpression seem to be important for tumor development in nonsmoking-related lung cancer.
Consequently, mutated EGFR is an excellent target for chemoprevention in nonsmoking-related lung cancer.
Previously, we showed that a high dose (50 mg/kg) of gefitinib
partially inhibited 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone–
induced tumorigenesis in A/J mice (16). Similarly, a very high
dose (100 mg/kg) of gefitinib significantly reduced benzo[a]
pyrene–induced tumorigenesis in A/J mice (17). 4-(Methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone and benzo[a] pyrene are potent
carcinogens found in tobacco smoke that induce oncogenic K-ras
mutations in A/J mice (12–14). In those classic smoking-related
lung cancer mouse models, however, gefitinib could not inhibit
Ras-related signaling as completely as suggested in recent ex vivo
studies (35, 36). Thus, if the chemopreventive agents do not match
the pathogenic mechanism, the result will be incomplete. In
contrast, we showed that a clinical dose (5 mg/kg) of gefitinib
completely inhibited tumorigenesis using our nonsmoking-related
lung cancer mouse model because we targeted a specific molecule
with a critical role in carcinogenesis.
If a population with a high risk of non–small cell lung cancer
induced by a mutated EGFR is selected, EGFR TKI can be used
clinically as a chemopreventive agent. Future advances in epidemiologic research will provide the predictors necessary for selecting such a population with higher precision instead of relying on
data regarding smoking history, sex, and ethnicity. In addition, the

risk of developing a second primary lung cancer in patients who
survived after the resection of primary early-stage of non–small cell
lung cancer is f1% to 2% per patient per year (37). If the first
primary lung cancer has activating EGFR mutations, the second
primary lung cancer is likely to have EGFR mutations as well because
the patient’s lungs would have been exposed to the same carcinogens
and be of the same genetic background as the primary lung cancer. In a similar fashion, chemoprevention trials using molecular
targeted agents associated with the tumorigenesis of primary lung
cancer might be feasible not only in mutated EGFR-related lung
cancer but also in other pathogenesis-related lung cancers. However, in applying EGFR TKI to a chemoprevention trial, considering
the potential for severe adverse events such as interstitial lung
disease is necessary (38, 39). Accordingly, the development of a new
EGFR TKI without adverse events of interstitial lung diseases or the
discovery of predictive factors of intestinal lung disease is expected.
One of the most effective ways to prevent EGFR mutationinduced non–small cell lung cancer is to remove the cause of the
EGFR mutation. X-ray–induced lung tumors carrying EGFR
mutations were recently reported in rats (40) and are presumed
to be one of the causes of activating EGFR mutations in humans.
However, the mutated EGFR in the rats did not correspond to
major activating EGFR mutations in humans. Moreover, the
oncogenesis of mutated EGFR in rats has not yet been reported.
These findings raised the questions of what causes activating
EGFR mutations. One study indicated a decreasing trend in the

incidence of EGFR mutations with increasing exposure to smoke
(6). Moreover, EGFR mutations are rare in other types of human
cancer. Nevertheless, the majority of human epithelial cancers
are marked by the functional activation of EGFR , which suggests
that the aspiration of an environmental carcinogen other than
tobacco smoke is the cause of EGFR mutations. In addition, recent
epidemiologic studies have shown that a longer total fertile life,
resulting from increased exposure to estrogen, increased the frequency of mutations in EGFR (41), whereas the consumption of soy,
which contains soybean isoflavones with antiestrogenic effects,
decreased the frequency (42). Thus, hormones appear to play an
important role in EGFR mutagenesis. Moreover, a dysfunctional
single nucleotide polymorphism in many DNA repair enzymes
was reported to be more frequent in Asians than in Whites (43).
Taken together, exposure to environmental carcinogens other than
tobacco smoke, hormonal imbalances, and defects in DNA repair
may explain why some EGFR mutations are detected more frequently among nonsmokers, females, and Asians. If dysfunctional
single nucleotide polymorphisms in DNA repair enzymes are
important causes of EGFR mutations, chemoprevention by genetic
stratification may be possible.
We investigated other factors related to the activation of EGFR
signaling in our transgenic mice. The status of ErbB2 and ErbB3
has been reported to predict gefitinib sensitivity (44, 45). Phosphorylated and total ErbB2 and ErbB3 were also up-regulated in
our transgenic mice compared with the wild-type controls. A
recent study suggested that increased EGFR signaling induced the
up-regulation of ErbB3 in a mouse model (46). ErbB2 and ErbB3
may have been up-regulated by altered EGFR signaling in our

transgenic mice. In addition, EGFR mutations were specifically
detected in terminal respiratory unit–type adenocarcinoma, which
constitutes a major subset of adenocarcinoma based on its distinctive morphology and expression of TTF-1 and surfactant protein (47). Note that TTF-1 expression was significantly higher in
our mouse model compared with the wild-type controls. TTF-1 was
recently shown to be crucial for the survival of a subset of lung
adenocarcinomas (48). ErbB2, ErbB3, and TTF-1 may have been
involved in carcinogenesis and the progression of lung tumors in
our transgenic mice. Therefore, they could also serve as excellent
chemopreventive targets.
In conclusion, gefitinib completely inhibited tumorigenesis in a
nonsmoking-related lung cancer mouse model, which was induced
by an activating EGFR mutation. Our results suggest that molecular
targeted chemoprevention is a viable approach to the treatment
of lung cancer.
