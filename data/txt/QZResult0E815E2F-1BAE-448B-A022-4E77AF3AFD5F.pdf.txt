BACKGROUND: The clinical activity of allosteric inhibitors of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) may be limited by upstream activation of phosphatidylinositol 3 (PI3)-kinase/Akt resulting from mTOR1 inhibition. On
the basis of this rationale, 2 independent phase 2 trials (Perifosine 228 and 231) were conducted to assess the efficacy and safety of
the novel Akt inhibitor perifosine in patients with advanced RCC who had failed on previous vascular endothelial growth factor
(VEGF)-targeted therapy. METHODS: In the Perifosine 228 trial, 24 patients with advanced RCC received oral perifosine (100 mg
daily). Perifosine 231 enrolled 2 groups that received daily oral perifosine (100 mg daily): Group A comprised 32 patients who had
received no prior mTOR inhibitor, and Group B comprised 18 patients who had received 1 prior mTOR inhibitor. RESULTS: In the Perifosine 228 trial, 1 patient achieved a partial response (objective response rate, 4%; 95% confidence interval, 0.7%-20%), and 11 patients
(46%) had stable disease as their best response. The median progression-free survival was 14.2 weeks (95% confidence interval, 7.721.6 weeks). In the Perifosine 231 trial, 5 patients achieved a partial response (objective response rate, 10%; 95% confidence interval,
4.5%-22.2%) and 16 patients (32%) had stable disease as their best response. The median progression-free survival was 14 weeks
(95% confidence interval, 12.9, 20.7 weeks). Overall, perifosine was well tolerated, and there were very few grade 3 and 4 events. The
most common toxicities included nausea, diarrhea, musculoskeletal pain, and fatigue. CONCLUSIONS: Although perifosine demonstrated activity in patients with advanced RCC after failure on VEGF-targeted therapy, its activity was not superior to currently available second-line agents. Nonetheless, perifosine may be worthy of further study in RCC in combination with other currently available

INTRODUCTION
The therapeutic relevance of the kinase mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) has been
established by the demonstration of clinical efficacy of allosteric mTOR inhibitors in patients with advanced RCC.1,2
Two such agents, the rapalogues temsirolimus and everolimus, are now approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of patients with advanced RCC.1,2 Despite prolongation of progression-free survival (PFS),
responses to these drugs occur in <5% of patients, and the median PFS is usually only 4 to 6 months. Efforts to improve
on these first-generation mTOR inhibitors have focused primarily on identifying and opposing potential mechanisms of
resistance to these agents.
Rapalogue therapy may induce the feedback activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway in
RCC tumor cells. Treatment with rapamycin in some patients has resulted in the activation of PI3K through a feedback
loop involving the insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGFR-1).3 It also is believed that rapalogues are more active in
suppressing the function of mTOR complex 1 (TORC1), the complex that includes mTOR and regulatory-associated
protein of TOR (raptor), and that they have less activity against TORC2, the complex that includes mTOR and rapamycin-insensitive companion of TOR (rictor). Treatment with rapamycin in some tumor cell types resulted in the derepression of TORC2, leading to the direct activation of Akt through enhanced TORC2-mediated phosphorylation of Akt on
serine 473 (Ser473).4 The finding that PI3K/Akt activates numerous survival and proliferation-promoting kinases,

lead to the hypothesis that greater therapeutic results may
be possible by circumventing the potential feedback loop
and targeting PI3K or Akt upstream of mTOR.
Perifosine (KRX-0401; 1,1-dimethyl-4 [([octadecyloxy]hydroxyphosphinyl)oxy]-piperidinium inner salt) is
a synthetic, substituted heterocyclic alkylphospholipid
that has demonstrated the ability to inhibit Akt activity.
Perifosine inhibits the activation of Akt by interfering
with the interaction between the pleckstrin homology domain of Akt and phosphatidylinositol phosphate (PIP3),
thereby precluding its translocation to the plasma membrane and activation through phosphorylation by pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase, isozyme 1 (PDK1).5
Furthermore, it was demonstrated recently that perifosine
both induced autophagy and inhibited the assembly of the
mTOR complexes by promoting the degradation of Akt,
mTOR, rictor, raptor, and the p70 S6 ribosomal kinase
through a glycogen synthase kinase-3/F-box and WD
repeat domain-containing 7 (GSK3/FBW7)-dependent
pathway.6
Perifosine has been tested in phase 1 and 2 trials
using a variety of dosing schedules and has been well tolerated. Nausea and diarrhea have been the most frequent
toxicities observed. In a recent randomized phase 2 trial
comparing different perifosine dosing schedules (daily vs
weekly administration) in patients with a variety of solid
tumors, perifosine was active in patients with RCC (Perifosine trial 207).7 Activity was observed with both dosing
schedules. Of the 212 patients enrolled, 13 had RCC, and
7 of these were evaluable for response. Three patients
(43%) had documented partial responses (PRs), and an
additional 2 patients (29%) had long-term disease stabilization. In addition, preclinical investigations revealed that
perifosine reliably inhibited Akt and S6 ribosomal protein
phosphorylation and induced apoptosis of RCC cell lines
in vitro.8 On the basis of these promising early clinical
and preclinical data, and to define its single-agent efficacy,
perifosine was assessed in 2 independent phase 2 clinical
trials (Perifosine 228 and Perifosine 231) in previously
treated patients with advanced RCC.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Inclusion Criteria

To be included in these 2 studies, adult patients (aged
>18 years) with an eastern Cooperative Oncology Group
(ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1 with confirmed
metastatic RCC were required to have documented

(RECIST)-defined disease progression after treatment
with sunitinib or sorafenib. Prior therapy with bevacizumab and/or cytokines (ie, interleukin-2, interferon) was
permitted, as was prior vaccine therapy in the adjuvant
setting. Patients enrolled in Perifosine 228 and in Group
A of Perifosine 231 were not allowed to have received
prior treatment with an mTOR inhibitor, whereas
patients enrolled in Group B of Perifosine 231 were
allowed to have failed therapy with 1 prior mTOR inhibitor. No prior brain metastasis were allowed on Perifosine
228, whereas patients with central nervous system metastases were allowed on Perifosine 231 provided that: 1)
central nervous system disease was documented by stable
or regressing lesions on magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) after radiation therapy, surgery, or both; 2)
patients were off corticosteroids for at least 1 month; and
3) patients had completed radiation therapy >28 days
before study entry.
Study Design

Both studies were single-arm, open-label phase 2 trials.
Informed consent was obtained from all patients before
any study-related activities. In both studies, after meeting
eligibility requirements, patients received oral perifosine
at a dose of 100 mg once daily. Perifosine had been studied previously in >1000 patients at both daily and weekly
dosing schedules. The lower 100-mg daily dose was
selected because of the tolerability and efficacy observed
in those previous studies.9 In Perifosine 228, treatment
cycles were 6 weeks in duration, but patients were evaluated by physical examination and safety laboratory evaluations every 3 weeks. In Perifosine 231, treatment cycles
were 4 weeks in duration, and patients were evaluated by
physical examination and safety laboratory evaluations on
day 1 of each cycle. In both studies, patients were allowed
to continue on study therapy provided that all nonhematologic toxicities had resolved to either grade 1 or tolerable
grade 2 according to version 3 of the National Cancer
Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse
Events (NCI-CTCAE 3.0).
Dose modification for toxicity was based on the
grade of the adverse event. For persistent grade 2 gastrointestinal adverse events, the dose was divided, and patients
received 50 mg twice daily. A dose reduction to 50 mg
once daily was allowed for persistent gastrointestinal side
effects. Other grade 2 adverse events first were treated
symptomatically without dose modification. If the adverse
event persisted or the regimen remained unacceptable
(intolerable) to the patient, then it was allowed to reduce
the dose by 50 mg daily. Patients were allowed a drug

holiday for up 2 weeks to allow for recovery from toxicity
before the initiation of the reduced dose. For grade 3 or 4
toxicities that were attributable to perifosine, drug was
held, and the patient was re-evaluated at least weekly until
toxicity improved to grade 1 or baseline. If the toxicity
resolved within 2 weeks, then the patient was allowed to
restart perifosine at a reduced dose of 50 mg. Patients for
whom perifosine-related toxicities did not resolve to grade
1 or baseline within 2 weeks or who could not tolerate a
reduced dose of 50 mg once daily were removed from the
study.
Before enrollment, all patients underwent a complete history and physical examination, a review of concomitant medications, ECOG performance status
assessment, and documentation of evaluable disease. Pretreatment tests included a complete blood count, standard
tests to document adequate organ function (eg, serum creatinine, liver function tests), prothrombin time/international normalized ratio, and radiographic evaluation of
disease by either computed tomography (CT) scan or
MRI. Radiographic studies were obtained 30 days
before the first dose of drug. All other baseline evaluations
were performed 14 days before the first dose of drug.
During the treatment phase of the study, patients on
Perifosine 228 underwent a complete history and physical
examination as well as routine blood testing every 3 weeks.
Radiographic disease evaluations occurred every 6 weeks
for the first 24 weeks, then every 12 weeks thereafter. On
Perifosine 231, patients underwent a complete history
and physical examination and routine blood testing every
4 weeks. Radiographic disease evaluations occurred every
12 weeks.
Outcome Measures

The primary objective for both protocols was to estimate
the median PFS for all patients who received treatment
with perifosine. PFS was measured from the date of registration until patients developed disease progression as
defined by RECIST. The primary endpoint for both protocols was the proportion of progression-free patients at
12 weeks. Because the first scan in Perifosine 231 was at
12 weeks, the progression-free proportion at 12 weeks was
calculated from first day of study drug treatment rather
than from the time of registration. Patients who died
without disease progression within 12 weeks and patients
who began nonprotocol therapy without evidence of progression within 12 weeks were not considered to be progression-free at 12 weeks. Secondary efficacy outcomes
included the objective response rate and the clinical benefit rate. The objective response rate was defined as the perCancer

centage of all treated patients who had a confirmed partial
response (PR) or complete response (CR). All CRs and
PRs required radiographic confirmation at 2 separate evaluations at least 28 days apart. Clinical benefit was defined
as either an objective response according to RECIST or
stable disease (SD) on the 12-week scan. Safety and toxicity were evaluated through physical examinations, laboratory evaluations, and adverse events, which were graded
according to the NCI-CTCAE 3.0.

Statistical Considerations

The objective of both phase 2 single-arm trials was to estimate the PFS of tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)-resistant
patients with RCC who received treatment with perifosine. In the Perifosine 228 trial, sample size calculation
was based on a binomial design, because all patients were
to be observed for at least 12 weeks. The study hypothesis
was that, for patients who progressed on sorafenib or sunitinib, the median PFS would be 6 weeks (ie, the next CT
scan) and that observation of 10-week PFS during perifosine treatment would indicate that perifosine was worthy
of further study. Assuming an exponential distribution,
this would be equivalent to 44% of patients remaining
alive and progression free at 12 weeks on perifosine compared with the a null value of 25%. To detect a 19% absolute improvement in the proportion that remained alive
and progression free at 12 weeks with 90% power using a
1-sided test with a Type I error rate of 0.1, 43 patients
were required. To allow for a 10% ineligibility rate, a goal
accrual of 48 patients was chosen. Perifosine was to be
declared worthy of further study if 14 patients remained
alive and progression free at 12 weeks.
For the Perifosine 231 trial, 2 patient cohorts were
studied: those who had previously failed on a vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor inhibitor but
not on an mTOR inhibitor (Group A) and those who had
failed both on a VEGF receptor inhibitor and on an
mTOR inhibitor (Group B). In Group A, perifosine was
to be deemed worthy of further study if 35% of the
patients responded or were progression free at 12 weeks,
but it was not to be considered for further study if the rate
was 15%. A 2-stage Simon design was used with 90%
power using a 1-sided test with a Type I error rate of 0.05.
In the first stage, 19 patients were to be entered. If 3 of
the 19 patients responded or were progression free at 12
weeks, then accrual to the study was to be halted. Otherwise, a total of 44 patients were to be accrued, and perifosine would be considered for further study if 8 patients
respond or were progression free at 12 weeks.

In Group B, perifosine was to be deemed worthy of
further study if 25% of the patients responded or were
progression free at 12 weeks, but it was not to be considered for further study if the rate was 10%. A 2-stage
Simon design was also used for this group with a 1-sided
test, a Type I error rate of 0.05, and a power of 80%. In
the first stage, 18 patients were to be entered. If 2
patients responded or were progression free at 12 weeks,
then accrual to the study was to be halted. Otherwise, a
total of 43 patients were to be accrued, and perifosine
would be considered for further study if 8 patients
responded or were progression free at 12 weeks.
Kaplan-Meier estimates of PFS were calculated
along with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs).

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics

In the Perifosine 228 trial, 24 patients with RCC (median
age, 67 years) were enrolled and received treatment with
perifosine from April 2007 to February 2009. In the Perifosine 231 patients, 50 patients (32 in Group A and 18 in
Group B; median age, 64 years) were enrolled and
received treatment with perifosine from December 2007
to July 2011. Accrual to both studies was halted in December 2008 after a decision by the sponsor because of
lack of resources. Patient characteristics from both studies
are listed in Table 1. In both Perifosine 228 and Perifosine
231, the majority of patients had an ECOG performance
status of 1 and clear cell histology (96% and 88%, respectively). In Perifosine 228, patients were distributed
equally with respect to the previous receipt of VEGF-targeted TKIs: 12 patients (50%) had received sorafenib,
and 12 patients (50%) had received sunitinib. In Perifosine 231, the majority of patients in both groups (76%)
had previously received sunitinib; and, in Group B, the
majority of patients (67%) had previously received
temsirolimus.

In Perifosine 228, all 24 patients were evaluable for efficacy and toxicity. Overall, the patients received study
drug for a range of 2 to 84 weeks. One patient experienced
a confirmed objective PR according to RECIST (objective
response rate, 4%; 95% CI, 0.7%-20%) (Table 2).
Another patient experienced an unconfirmed PR on the
first CT scan but developed new bone metastases on the
confirmatory scan and, thus, was classified with progressive disease (PD). Eleven patients experienced a best
response of SD, whereas 12 patients experienced PD. The
overall median PFS was 14.2 weeks (95% CI, 7.7-21.6

received study drug for a range of 1 to 180 weeks. In
Group A, 4 patients experienced a confirmed objective
PR (objective response rate, 13%). Duration of responses
ranged from 13 weeks to 142 weeks. Nine patients experienced a best response of SD, whereas 19 patients experienced PD. The median PFS for Group A was 14.1 weeks

A of Perifosine 231 combined with all patients in Perifosine 228 was 14.1 weeks (95% CI, 12.6-20.0 weeks). In
both studies, for all patients who had previously received
sorafenib (n ¼ 24), the median PFS was 19.4 weeks (95%
CI, 11.9-30.0 weeks); for all patients who had previously
received sunitinib (n ¼ 50), the median PFS was 12.3
weeks (95% CI, 11.4-16.3 weeks). In patients with nonclear cell histology (n ¼ 6), the median PFS was 13.4
weeks (95% CI, 7-19.7 weeks). The objective response
rate for all patients who were treated on Perifosine 228
and 231 was 8.1% (95% CI, 3.9%-17%). The median
duration for all PRs was 36 weeks.

Toxicity

In both trials, the most common adverse events were gastrointestinal symptoms (diarrhea, nausea), fatigue, and
musculoskeletal pain (Table 3). There were very few grade
3 or 4 adverse events in either study, and the most common events were anemia (n ¼ 3), edema (n ¼ 3), and
hypomagnesemia (n ¼ 3). There was no clear correlation
between adverse events and response to perifosine. Overall, 4 patients (17%) in Perifosine 228 and 10 patients
(20%) in Perifosine 231 required a dose reduction to a 50
mg daily because of adverse events.
DISCUSSION
Despite the many recent advances in RCC therapeutics,
currently available agents in RCC are generally limited to
2 classes of drugs: VEGF signaling inhibitors and allosteric inhibitors of mTOR. Immune-based therapy with
interferon and interleukin-2 and chemotherapy with fluorinated pyrimidines are not commonly used.10 Novel
agents with alternate mechanisms of action are needed to
improve the therapeutic outcomes for patients with
advanced RCC. In our 2 current phase 2 trials, we
describe the efficacy of a novel alkylphospholipid Akt inhibitor in previously treated patients with advanced RCC.
Although neither trial was completely accrued, perifosine exceeded the proscribed efficacy goals in both trials.
Both objective tumor responses and prolonged disease stability were observed (Fig. 2). In some patients, responses
were quite prolonged, lasting as long as 180 weeks (median PR duration, 36 weeks). At the same time, perifosine
also was very well tolerated, as evidenced by the low incidence of grade 3 and 4 toxicities (Table 3). It must be
noted, however, that the aforementioned efficacy goals
and outcome measures were established shortly after the
approval of both sorafenib and sunitinib and in the absence of data on the efficacy of second-line therapy after

sorafenib, sunitinib, or both were randomized to receive
either everolimus (n ¼ 277) or placebo (n ¼ 139) with a
primary endpoint of PFS.2 At the final assessment, the
median PFS for the patients who received everolimus was
4.9 months compared with 1.9 months in the placebo
group (hazard ratio, 0.33; 95% CI, 0.25-0.43; P <

.0001).11 In the patients who received everolimus, those
who had previously received sorafenib alone had a median
PFS of 5.9 months versus 3.9 months in those who had
previously received sunitinib alone. Five patients (2%) in
the everolimus group experienced PRs versus 0 in the placebo group. In the AXIS trial (a trial of the comparative
effectiveness of axitinib vs sorafenib in advanced RCC),
723 patients with advanced RCC who had failed 1 prior
systemic therapy (sunitinib, bevacizumab, temsirolimus,
or cytokine-based therapy) were randomized in a 1:1 fashion to receive either axitinib (n ¼ 361) or sorafenib (n ¼
362) with a primary endpoint of PFS.12 In patients who
had previously received sunitinib, the PFS was 4.8 months
in the axitinib group versus 3.8 months in the sorafenib
group (P ¼ .0107).
Although comparisons across independent trials are
challenging, it must be noted that the patient populations
studied in the 2 trials described here (Table 1) were quite
similar to one another and also were similar to the population studied in the RECORD-1 trial with respect to basic
demographics (age, sex), performance status, and prior
therapies (proportion of patients that received prior sunitinib vs sorafenib).2,11 Although the demographics, performance status, and number of prior therapies among
patients in the Perifosine 228 and Perifosine 231 trials
also were very similar to those variables among patients in
the AXIS study, the comparison is complicated further by
the exclusion of prior sorafenib treatment in the AXIS
trial.12 However, acknowledging the limitations of historic comparisons, within this more modern clinical context, the efficacy of perifosine that we have described after
failure of sorafenib or sunitinib appears modest and not
superior to currently available second-line agents.
The exact mechanism for the observed antitumor
effect of perifosine in RCC remains unknown. Multiple
mechanisms have been implicated that may mediate the
antitumor effect of perifosine in preclinical studies,
including the induction of apoptosis through both intrinsic and extrinsic pathways, cell cycle arrest, and antiangiogenesis in a variety of tumor types,13-19 all of which are
mediated through Akt rather than mTOR. The finding
that PFS for patients in Groups A and B on the Perifosine
231 trial was nearly identical supports the belief that the
mechanism of action of perifosine in RCC is distinct from
that of the allosteric mTOR inhibitors. Furthermore,
many investigators have demonstrated additive benefits
from combining perifosine with a rapalogue in preclinical
studies of multiple tumor types, including RCC.20-22
These findings, combined with the observation that perifosine is very well tolerated with toxicities that generally

do not overlap with those of VEGF antagonists and rapalogues, suggest that perifosine may be an attractive agent
to assess clinically in combination with currently available
agents in RCC. Indeed, a clinical trial is already underway
combining perifosine with temsirolimus in patients with
malignant glioma (National Clinical Trial identifier
NCT01051557).
In conclusion, although perifosine has clear singleagent activity in patients with advanced RCC after failure
on VEGF-targeted TKIs, this activity must be considered
modest and clearly is not superior to that of other currently available second-line agents. Overall, these results
to do not support the further clinical development of perifosine as a single-agent in RCC. Nonetheless, a small subset of patients clearly derived substantial clinical benefit
from treatment with perifosine. Further studies are
needed into the mechanism of Akt activation in RCC,
and such investigations may lead to the better selection of
patients who might respond to similarly targeted agents.
As perifosine has currently demonstrated promising activity in combination with chemotherapy for gastrointestinal
malignancies, combinational therapy with agents like
mTOR inhibitors may be worthy of further investigation
in RCC.
