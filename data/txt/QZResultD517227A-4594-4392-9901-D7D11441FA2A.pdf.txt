BACKGROUND. Higher prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and alkaline phosphatase (ALKP) levels predicted worse survival in men with metastatic hormone-refractory prostate
cancer (HRPC). In the current study, the authors evaluated the combined effects of
PSA and ALK-P on survival.

METHODS. Two hundred twenty-four men who had HRPC with bone metastases and

available on both ALK-P and PSA levels at chemotherapy initiation. The primary endpoint of the study was overall survival (OS) after chemotherapy. The men were dichotinstitutional normal ranges. The effect of PSA was evaluated as both a categorical
value and a continuous value using Cox regression.

RESULTS. Eighty-nine of 143 patients (62%) had elevated ALK-P levels. The median
PSA was 147 ng/mL (93 ng/mL in patients with normal ALK-P, 171 ng/mL in patients
with elevated ALK-P). At a median follow-up of 30 months after chemotherapy initiation, 93 patients had died. The median OS after chemotherapy was 15.8 months (95%
confidence interval, 12.8–18.4 months) and was significantly longer if ALK-P was in
the normal range (21.3 months vs 14 months; P 5 .005). For the group with normal
ALK-P levels, the median OS was 12.5 months, 24.5 months, and 36.9 months for
patients with low, medium, and high PSA levels, respectively. In contrast, the effect of
PSA on survival was not as evident in the group with elevated ALK-P levels (16.5
months vs 11.9 months vs 12.1 months, respectively; P 5 .14 for interaction). Ageadjusted multivariate analysis demonstrated statistically significant interactions of
PSA and ALK-P with OS (P 5 .02).

rostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death among
men in the United States.1 After failure on androgen-deprivation
therapy (ADT), progression to hormone-refractory prostate cancer
(HRPC) is inevitable, and patients eventually develop metastatic disease. Despite advances in chemotherapy, the median survival remains
poor at only 18 months.

alkaline phosphatase (ALK-P), hemoglobin (Hgb), and
prostate-specific antigen (PSA), have been evaluated for
their prognostic significance in such models. Almost
universally, elevated ALK-P levels are associated with
worse survival. However, studies have not demonstrated
consensus about the prognostic importance of PSA despite the finding that an elevated PSA often is considered a poor prognostic sign. In addition, to our
knowledge, no study to date has evaluated the combined effect of ALK-P and PSA in predicting overall survival (OS) for men with metastatic HRPC.
In patients with HRPC, physicians may use several
factors to interpret the status of the patient’s disease,
including changes in PSA over time, clinical symptoms,
and patterns of metastasis. In our practice, we identified
a series of men who had HRPC with bone metastases
who, although they had PSA levels of >1000 ng/mL,
experienced no pain or other cancer-related symptoms
and had a good quality of life. We noted that serum
ALK-P levels in these patients often are within the normal range despite extensive bone metastases and the
suggestion of PSA or radiographic progression. The case
of our index patient is presented below.

A Case Presentation of the Index Patient
Our index patient was a man aged 85 years who had
presented initially 17 years earlier with Gleason 9 prostate adenocarcinoma. His initial workup showed no metastases, and he was treated with prostate radiotherapy.
He developed a recurrence several years later with a rising PSA, and he received ADT and, later, secondary hormone therapies. When he developed widely metastatic
HRPC at age 82 years, he received docetaxel and estramustine chemotherapy. His PSA at the initiation of
chemotherapy was 1640 ng/mL, and his ALK-P was normal at 99 U/L. His PSA declined significantly with
chemotherapy, but he stopped after 6 months because
of fatigue. After his PSA started rising again, he received
single-agent docetaxel and then docetaxel plus carboplatin when it appeared he no longer was responding to
docetaxel. He continued intermittent chemotherapy for
3 years, during which time his PSA eventually increased
to >10,000 ng/mL. It is noteworthy that the patient
never developed bone pain despite evidence of radiographic progression on bone scan, and he maintained a
good quality of life, golfing and bowling up though his
second year of chemotherapy. It was particularly significant that his ALK-P levels remained within normal
range during the 3 years he received intermittent chemotherapy. Two months after his last infusion of docetaxel
plus carboplatin, the patient became progressively fatigued and cachectic. We observed that he had progressive pancytopenia with 10% circulating blasts. He was

referred to a hematologist; however, a bone marrow
biopsy was declined because of his poor performance
status. The patient died of apparent leukemia. The
patient and his family decided not to diagnose or treat
him further, because he was very ill; and, at that time,
his life expectancy was estimated at less than several
weeks.
This clinical observation of very elevated PSA levels
in men with HRPC and bone metastases but with normal ALK-P levels and lack of pain was noted in several
other patients. Therefore, we evaluated the combined
effect of high PSA levels and normal ALK-P levels on survival in men with HRPC who had bone metastases in
our institutional database.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Selection
The cohort for this study was identified retrospectively
from the Prostate Clinical Research Information System
(Prostate CRIS) at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute
(DFCI).6 Prostate CRIS is an ongoing longitudinal system that captures patient characteristics, including biopsy Gleason score, PSA, clinical stage, radiology (bone
and computed tomography [CT] scan) results, a history
of all treatments received, and disease status at each
visit. All patients provided written informed consent to
allow the analysis of clinical data for research purposes,
and this study was approved by the DFCI IRB.
By using the Prostate CRIS, we identified a cohort of
224 patients who received first-line chemotherapy for
HRPC and who had bone metastases at the initiation of
chemotherapy. Eligible patients had to demonstrate evidence of progressive disease by PSA or scans after ADT.
To meet the definition of HRPC, patients were required
to have 2 rises in PSA above the nadir level while they
were receiving ADT, and each rise had to be separated
by at least 1 week. The date of hormone-refractory disease progression was defined as the date of the first rise
in PSA above the ADT nadir. Patients also were required
to have bone metastases demonstrated on bone or CT
scans before the initiation of chemotherapy.
To be included for this analysis, any number of
prior secondary hormone therapies for HRPC was
allowed, but no prior chemotherapy was allowed.
Patients were required to have both serum ALK-P and
PSA levels recorded and available at the start of chemotherapy. PSA and ALK-P levels generally were collected
at a 1-month time window before the initiation of
chemotherapy. If patients had PSA and ALK-P levels
available only within 3 months of starting chemotherapy, then their medical records were reviewed to confirm that they received no other treatment during this
time frame.

Statistical Considerations
Patient characteristics at diagnosis and at the initiation
of chemotherapy were summarized as the number and
percentage of patients or as the median and range of
levels. Patients were dichotomized according to their
ALK-P and Hgb levels into normal groups and abnormal
groups based on the institutional normal ranges (ALK-P,
38–126 U/L; Hgb, 14–18 g/dL or 13.2–16.7 g/dL in the
newer laboratories for 4 patients). PSA was evaluated
both as a categorical variable (low, <77 ng/mL; medium,
77–233 ng/mL; and high, 233 ng/mL) using the 33%
and 66% percentile cutoff values and as continuous
values with natural log transformation in Cox regression
(because of a heavily right-skewed distribution). Conclusions were drawn based on continuous PSA levels,
and a descriptive summary also was provided according
to categories of PSA levels.
The primary endpoint of the study was OS after the
initiation of first-line chemotherapy, which was defined
as the time from the chemotherapy was started to either
the date of death from all causes or the date the patient
was last known alive and, thus, was censored. The distribution of OS was estimated by using the Kaplan-Meier
product-limit method; median and t-year OS, along
with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs), were summarized. Associations between OS and patient characteristics were assessed by using the log-rank test for
categorical variables or the Cox proportional hazards
model for continuous values. Cox regression modeling
was undertaken in multivariate analyses, which focused
on the interaction of PSA and ALK-P as predictive factors for OS. Statistical analyses were performed by using
SAS software (version 9; SAS Institution Inc., Cary, NC).
All P values and 95% CIs are 2-sided.

RESULTS
Patient Selection
Two hundred twenty-four patients with HRPC who
received first-line chemotherapy between 1999 and
2006 were identified in the database. PSA and ALK-P
levels were available within 1 month before chemotherapy in 137 patients. Among 8 patients who had PSA and
ALK-P levels within 3 months before chemotherapy, 2
patients were excluded from the current analysis
because they were receiving other treatments at that
point. Thus, in total, 143 patients had evaluable PSA and
ALK-P levels and were included in this analysis. There
were no statistically significant differences in patient
characteristics, including patient age, Gleason score,
PSA, and clinical stage at diagnosis or patient age and
PSA at the initiation of chemotherapy, between patients
with and without available ALK-P levels (P > .05). However, patients without available ALK-P levels did have a

shorter time to initiating chemotherapy after diagnosis
(median, 4.6 years vs 7 years; P 5 .005) and after their
cancer became hormone refractory (median, 17 months
vs 27 months; P 5 .0003).

Patient Characteristics
Baseline patient characteristics at diagnosis and at the
initiation of chemotherapy are summarized in Table 1.
At diagnosis, 15% of patients had distant metastases.
Skeletal metastases and nonregional lymph node involvement were observed in 13% and 9% of patients,
respectively. All patients had bone metastases at
the initiation of chemotherapy. The median time from
the development of hormone-refractory disease to the
initiation of chemotherapy was 27 months (interquartile
range [IQR], 11–43 months; range, <1–145 months), and
94% of patients received at least 1 secondary hormone
therapy for HRPC before chemotherapy. At the start of
chemotherapy, the median age was 70 years (range, 45–
88 years), and the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group
(ECOG) performance status was 0 or 1 in 87% of
patients. The median ALK-P level was 159 U/L (IQR, 97–
317 U/L; range, 52–2020 U/L), and 89 patients (62%)
had elevated ALK-P. The median PSA level at the start of
chemotherapy was 147 ng/mL (IQR, 54–355; range, 1–
8138 ng/mL) for all patients and was significantly higher
in the group with elevated ALK-P (median, 171 ng/mL
vs 93 ng/mL; P 5 .006).
Univariate Analysis
At median follow-up of 30 months after the initiation of
chemotherapy, 93 patients had died. The median OS after the initiation of first-line chemotherapy was 15.8
months (95% CI, 12.8–18.4 months). The estimated OS
was 31% at 2 years and 19% at 3 years after the initiation
of chemotherapy. Survival was significantly longer for
men who had ALK-P levels in the normal range (median,
21 months vs 14 months; log-rank P 5 .005). Lower Hgb
levels were associated with reduced survival in a
Cox univariate regression analysis (P < .0001) (Table 2).
PSA at the initiation of chemotherapy was not a significant predictor for all patients, but it showed heterogeneity in its association with OS between the groups
with normal and elevated ALK-P (P 5 .14 for the interaction). For the group of patients with elevated ALK-P, as
expected, survival was shorter, but the effect of PSA on
survival was not as evident (Fig. 1B) (median OS: 16.5
months vs 11.9 months vs 12.1 months for patients with
low [<77 ng/mL], medium, and high [233 ng/mL]
PSA, respectively). In contrast, for patients with normal
ALK-P, a higher PSA was associated with prolonged survival (Fig. 1A) (median OS: 12.5 months vs 24.5 months
vs 36.9 months, respectively).

Multivariate Analysis
In multivariate analysis, after adjusting for age and Hgb,
the association of PSA with OS among patients with normal and elevated ALK-P became more apparent (interaction effect: P 5 .02) (Table 3). The relative risk from a
1-unit increase in the value of natural logarithm (PSA)
was 0.65 (95% CI, 0.48–0.88) if men had an ALK-P level
in the normal range compared with 1.01 (95% CI, 0.81–
1.26) if men had an elevated ALK-P level. Figure 2
demonstrates how the estimated relative risk of death
changes with changes in PSA (relative to the cohort with
a median PSA of 147 ng/mL) in patients with normal
and elevated ALK-P levels in a Cox multivariate regression model. In the group of patients with elevated ALK-P,
PSA levels have no significant influence on survival;
whether PSA levels are lower or higher than the median
level of 147 ng/mL, the relative risk remains near 1.0.
However, in patients with normal ALK-P levels, there is a
significant association between higher PSA levels and
improved OS; as PSA levels decrease from the median
PSA of 147 ng/mL, the relative risk of death increases,
whereas the relative risk decreases as PSA levels increase.
The effect of age on OS also differed in the ALK-P
groups: The relative risk of death from a 5-year increase
in age was 1.42 in patients with normal ALK-P versus
1.09 in patients with elevated ALK-P (test for interaction:

2713

P 5 .07). Decreased Hgb was associated with a shorter
OS regardless of the ALK-P level (P 5 .002).

DISCUSSION
Patients who have HRPC with bone metastases who are
initiating chemotherapy have a limited life expectancy:
Their median survival in clinical trials and in the current
analysis is comparable at approximately 1.5 years. However, the survival of individual patients with metastatic
HRPC varies broadly. For the patient and his physician,
accurately assessing prognosis is critical in guiding
treatment options, gauging quality of life, and planning
for the future.5,7 In our practice, we have identified a
subset of patients with metastatic HRPC who may feel
well despite very high PSA levels. An observation
that some of these patients also demonstrated normal
ALK-P levels prompted the initiation of this study.
Large multivariate analyses of men with androgenindependent, metastatic prostate cancer have indicated
that elevated ALK-P is an independent predictor of
shorter OS.3,5 Along with ALK-P, age, performance status, Hgb, albumin, LDH, and PSA also may predict OS.
However, to out knowledge, no study to date has been
performed that assesses the combined effect of PSA and
ALK-P levels on predicting OS in men with HRPC and
bone metastases.
Bone metastases from prostate cancer are characterized by both excessive bone formation and resorption
because of the increased numbers and activity of osteoblasts and osteoclasts.8 Bone scans are considered a
gold standard for detecting metastatic skeletal lesions in
prostate cancer because their high sensitivity. However,
bone scans have not been helpful in monitoring
changes in bone lesions. ALK-P has been associated
with the existence of skeletal metastases in prostate cancer for more than 60 years, ever since Huggins and
Hodges documented decreases in serum ALK-P after
ADT.9 It has been demonstrated that ALK-P levels are
correlated with osteoblast activity. An earlier study from
the National Prostatic Cancer Program measured levels
of total and bone ALK-P in 357 patients with bone metastases who developed recurrent disease after orchiectomy. Elevated total ALK-P levels were reported in 85% of
those patients, and normal ALK-P levels were reported
in 15%. Elevated bone-specific ALK-P (BAP) levels were
observed in 44% of patients.10 In the current study,
62.2% of patients (N 5 89 men) had abnormal ALK-P
levels at the initiation of chemotherapy (Table 2). Fewer
patients in our study had high ALK-P levels, probably
reflecting a shift in this population of patients.
Despite the frequent use of ALK-P levels for monitoring the activity of prostate cancer cells in the bone,
there has been concern that the clinical interpretation

of ALK-P may be difficult. For instance, there are several
tissue-specific isoenzymes for ALK-P, and its increased
value may reflect either bone or liver metastases.11,12
BAP consists of approximately 40% ALK-P among several tissue-specific isoenzymes.13 However, the results
from a recent study indicate that serum levels of total
ALK-P and BAP are correlated highly and that total ALKP primarily reflects BAP in men with HRPC and bone
metastases.8

who had normal ALK-P levels. In addition, that effect
was paradoxical—namely, patients with the highest PSA
levels in this group had the longest survival. This group
included our index patient; and, indeed, this novel finding appears to confirm the possibility that higher PSA
levels may connote a more well-differentiated cancer
that is associated with better survival. Smaletz et al. suggested the protective effect of elevated PSA on survival
and possible predictors, including quantitative measures of the extent of skeletal metastases.5 However,
those authors only examined the overall effect of
PSA without comparing the groups with normal and

elevated ALK-P. Our current results indicated that this
effect was not observed across all patients; and, indeed,
patients with elevated ALK-P levels at the start of chemotherapy showed no difference in survival based on
PSA. Overall, as expected, this group had worse survival,
and their PSA levels, whether low or high, appeared to
provide no additional prognostic insight. Conversely,
patients who had bone metastases and normal ALK-P
levels at the start of chemotherapy likely represented a
more heterogeneous population of patients, including
some who progressed to elevated ALK-P and more
symptomatic disease and others, like our index patient,
who never developed bone pain from prostate cancer
despite diffuse skeletal metastases that were visible on
bone scan.
This study also confirmed the well-described correlation between Hgb and survival. LDH was not
included in this analysis, because it is not measured
routinely in our hospital. It has been reported in
many studies that ECOG performance status is predictive; however, its effect was not evident in our
cohort, reflecting the finding that 86% of our patients
had an ECOG performance of 0 or 1 at the initiation
of chemotherapy. The unique aspect of the current
study is that, to our knowledge, it is the first to consider comparing the effect of PSA on survival between
the patients with normal and elevated ALK-P.
Weaknesses of this study include its retrospective
nature, the lack of PSA and ALK-P data on a significant
proportion of patients, and a lack of a clear-cut biologic
explanation for the findings. Some patients in our database were not treated directly at our institution but still
were included in the original denominator of all patients
currently represented in the Prostate CRIS. In addition,
the reason why PSA was not a significant factor in the
elevated ALK-P group remains unclear. For instance, if
higher PSA levels are reflective of a more well-differentiated cancer (and vice versa), then why would this finding not be independent of ALK-P levels?
In summary, ALK-P levels at the time first-line
chemotherapy was initiated were a significant factor in
predicting OS for men with HRPC who had bone metastases. In men who had normal ALK-P levels, a higher
PSA was a good prognostic factor for OS. It has been
argued that PSA is not an ideal surrogate endpoint in

2715

patients with HRPC. However, PSA remains a useful
marker for prostate cancer. The current results suggest
that monitoring both ALK-P and PSA improves the ability to predict survival in men with metastatic HRPC.
This finding will be useful in counseling patients who
are worried about their very high PSA levels when their
ALK-P levels are normal. Given our restricted patient
population, this finding should be validated in a larger
prospective study in men who have HRPC with bone
metastases.
