Progression-Free Survival: Does a
Correlation With Survival Justify
Its Role as a Surrogate Clinical
Endpoint?
We thank Becker et al1 for their thoughtful editorial on
our article2 describing progression-free survival (PFS) as a
surrogate endpoint for overall survival (OS) in renal cancer clinical trials. We agree that our data do not necessarily
support the use of PFS as a surrogate endpoint for OS
across the entire renal cancer therapeutic spectrum.2 We
further concur that additional work needs to be done to
establish PFS as a pragmatic endpoint for regulatory purposes. However, we disagree with Becker et al that it is
necessary to fulfill Prentice criteria to establish surrogacy.
More specifically, fulfilling Prentice‚Äôs third criterion that
the treatment effect on the surrogate (PFS) should capture
the full effect of treatment on the clinical endpoint (OS) is
an extremely high bar.3 Multiple authors have argued for
and suggested different approaches to the validation of the
surrogate.4-8 Although a full discussion is beyond the
scope of this correspondence, we would like to point out
that one alternative approach is the adjusted association
h.9 The adjusted association first estimates the dependency parameter within each treatment arm and then
aggregates the information by a weighted average. As we
demonstrated in our article,2 the adjusted association was
a highly statistically significant measure that strongly suggests that PFS is a surrogate endpoint for OS, at least
within the context of the trials analyzed.

Reply to Progression-Free
Survival: Does a Correlation
With Survival Justify Its Role as
a Surrogate Clinical Endpoint?
We thank Halabi et al for their expert comment on our
editorial,1 which referred to their previous article.2
Although we agree that, from a statistical perspective,
there is reason to believe that progression-free survival
(PFS) may represent an adequate surrogate endpoint for
overall survival (OS), we do not agree that this statistical
association is sufficient to officially accept PFS as the surrogate endpoint for OS. As noted in the IMPACT study,
which examined sipuleucel-T immunotherapy for patients
with castration-resistant prostate cancer, an improved OS
was not found to be associated with an improved PFS.3
Therefore, it would be difficult to justify the role of PFS as
a surrogate endpoint for OS if the 2 do not always correlate. Furthermore, pharmaceutical drugs may often perpetuate OS, independent of disease progression.

Although it may be stipulated that Prentice‚Äôs third
criterion4 is considered a ‚Äúhigh bar,‚Äù we argue that it
should be so. Our intention is not to completely reject the
possibility of attributing a higher importance to PFS
when interpreting results from ongoing and future clinical
trials, but rather we believe that the advancements made
in the treatment of metastatic renal cell carcinoma after
the era of targeted therapy have made it possible for physicians and patients to look forward to real improvements
in both OS and quality of life, and not merely to an
increased time to disease progression.

Critical Evaluation of the
Scientific Content in Clinical
Practice Guidelines
On behalf of the European Society for Medical Oncology
(ESMO) Guidelines Committee, we thank Abdelsattar
Cancer

June 1, 2015

et al for their valuable comments, and would like to further comment on their article.1
This article assessed several practice-based clinical
guidelines concerning rectal cancer, including the ESMO
clinical practice guideline (ESMO CPG) published in
2013, using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research &
Evaluation (AGREE II) instrument.
The ESMO CPG on rectal cancer is one of many
ESMO CPGs that form part of a wider guidelines service
package released by ESMO to support the medical community, mainly medical oncologists. This package also includes
the ESMO Pocket Guidelines and mobile library application as handy formats, the much more extensive ESMO
consensus statements, and the ESMO guides for patients.
ESMO CPGs are practical, concise documents aimed at
providing essential information for the community served
by ESMO. In the article by Abdelsattar et al,1 only the CPG
publications were assessed, rather than the whole spectrum
of guideline publications from ESMO for colon and rectal
cancer. We believe that this has had an impact on some of
the scores reported using the AGREE II instrument:
 The ESMO consensus statements are complementary
to the ESMO CPG and include additional information.
They are structured in a defined evidence-based analytical format, generally in the form of specific questions
and evidence-based answers reached by consensus of an
expert panel. In 2012, ESMO published a comprehensive consensus statement regarding the management of
patients with colon and rectal cancer, and this initiative
was repeated in December 2014.2
 The ESMO CPG is a relatively brief summary of the
consensus statement, with new and (annually) updated
information regarding scientific developments.
 ESMO CPGs form the basis of the ESMO Pocket
Guidelines and mobile library application, which establish ESMO CPGs in a concise, clear format and aim to
improve their dissemination and applicability.
 ESMO patient guides are derived from ESMO CPGs
and are produced in collaboration with the Anticancer
Fund. The ESMO Cancer Patient Working Group is
involved in the production of all ESMO guides for
patients and includes representatives of several European patient advocacy organizations.
For each of these different formats of evidence analysis and presentation in guidelines, including CPGs,
ESMO has established methodological rules and standard
operating procedures. Methodology and content follow a
strict policy of guidelines definition and in-practice application, which is updated every 1 to 3 years. This
