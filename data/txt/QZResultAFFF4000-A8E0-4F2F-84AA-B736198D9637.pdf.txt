ABSTRACT
Di(2-pyridyl)ketone 4,4-dimethyl-3-thiosemicarbazone (Dp44mT) and di(2pyridyl)ketone 4‑cyclohexyl-4-methyl-3-thiosemicarbazone (DpC) are novel, highly
potent and selective anti-tumor and anti-metastatic drugs. Despite their structural
similarity, these agents differ in their efficacy and toxicity in-vivo. Considering this,
a comparison of their pharmacokinetic and pharmaco/toxico-dynamic properties
was conducted to reveal if these factors are involved in their differential activity.
Both compounds were administered to Wistar rats intravenously (2 mg/kg) and their
metabolism and disposition were studied using UHPLC-MS/MS. The cytotoxicity of
both thiosemicarbazones and their metabolites was also examined using MCF-7, HL60 and HCT116 tumor cells and 3T3 fibroblasts and H9c2 cardiac myoblasts. Their
intracellular iron-binding ability was characterized by the Calcein-AM assay and their
iron mobilization efficacy was evaluated. In contrast to DpC, Dp44mT undergoes
rapid demethylation in-vivo, which may be related to its markedly faster elimination
(T1/2 = 1.7 h for Dp44mT vs. 10.7 h for DpC) and lower exposure. Incubation of these
compounds with cancer cells or cardiac myoblasts did not result in any significant
metabolism in-vitro. The metabolism of Dp44mT in-vivo resulted in decreased anticancer activity and toxicity. In conclusion, marked differences in the pharmacology
of Dp44mT and DpC were observed and highlight the favorable pharmacokinetics of
DpC for cancer treatment.

INTRODUCTION

These agents target cellular iron (Fe) and copper
(Cu) as essential micronutrients and inhibit ribonucleotide
reductase, which results in inhibition of DNA synthesis
and cell growth [4, 7]. Furthermore, their complexes with
Fe and Cu generate oxidative stress in cancer cells, which
further augments their anti-proliferative activity [3, 5, 8]
and this is also involved in their ability to overcome drug
resistance [9]. These compounds have also been shown to
target apoptotic and autophagic pathways [1, 3, 5, 10-12]
and inhibit oncogenic signaling that regulates cancer cell
growth, proliferation and metastasis [6, 13-15].
Based on its high efficacy and selectivity towards
cancer cells, di(2-pyridyl)ketone 4,4-dimethyl-3thiosemicarbazone (Dp44mT, Figure 1A) was selected
as the first lead compound of the DpT group [1, 4].
However, cardiac fibrosis was demonstrated in mice after
chronically repeated dosing at high non-optimal levels [1].
This observation initiated the development of the second
generation of the DpT class, where di(2-pyridyl)ketone
4-cyclohexyl-4-methyl-3-thiosemicarbazone (DpC, Figure
1A) was identified as the new lead compound [2, 6].

Despite the substantial progress in anti-cancer
therapy in the last two decades, cancer still remains
a serious public health issue worldwide. Resistance
to current chemotherapies, along with metastasis, are
among the main complications that stifle effective clinical
management of cancer. Hence, there is still an urgent need
for novel, more efficient anti-tumor agents which can
address these concerns.
Ligands derived from the di(2-pyridyl)ketone
thiosemicarbazone (DpT, Figure 1A) series are a promising
group of novel anti-cancer drugs showing marked and
significant benefits over the older thiosemicarbazone,
Triapine®, which has been evaluated in clinical trials [1, 2].
Comprehensive chemical and pharmacological research on
these new compounds has demonstrated their unique and
selective efficacy and complex mechanism of activity [3,
4]. An important aspect of these novel thiosemicarbazones
is their ability to inhibit both tumor growth and metastasis
in a variety of tumor-types [1, 2, 5, 6].

RESULTS

While DpC is relatively similar to Dp44mT in
terms of chemical structure (Figure 1A), it shows several
advantages to the latter [2, 6]. These include: (1) DpC,
unlike Dp44mT, does not induce cardiac fibrosis even
when administered at markedly higher doses [2]; (2)
Unlike Dp44mT, DpC does not induce oxidation of
oxyhemoglobin to methemoglobin in red blood cells
[16]; (3) DpC exhibits greater activity than Dp44mT
in-vivo, even in poorly responding cancer-types, such
as pancreatic cancer [6]; and (4) DpC showed marked
and effective activity after both oral and intravenous
administration [17], while Dp44mT is toxic after oral
administration [17]. Moreover, the anti-proliferative
efficacy of DpC in-vivo exceeds that of the current “gold
standard” chemotherapeutic agent, gemcitabine, against a
human pancreatic cancer xenograft [6]. Therefore, DpC is
currently the most extensively investigated and active of
the DpT class of ligands that is expected to enter clinical
trials later in 2015.
Despite the prominent anti-proliferative activity of
these novel thiosemicarbazones, there are still only scarce
data regarding their metabolism and disposition. Although
limited data on the in-vitro metabolism of DpC in human
liver microsomal and S9 fractions have been reported [18],
no data on the in-vivo pharmacokinetics (PK) of either of
the lead compounds (Dp44mT and DpC, respectively)
are available. This information may be particularly
important to better understand the efficacy and safety of
DpC in-vivo and to promote its further preclinical and
clinical development [19]. Despite their similar chemical
structures, both compounds may differ in their PK,
which may explain, or at least contribute to, their distinct
toxicity and efficacy profiles [19]. Given the fact that their
mechanism of action involves redox reactions [3] and the
compounds are sensitive to oxidation [20], formation of
oxidative or other metabolites in cancer and/or cardiac
cells cannot be excluded. Furthermore, the potential
oxidative metabolites of the agents could have biological
activity. The lack of the above mentioned data is largely
caused by the relatively complicated analysis in biological
materials, which is a prerequisite for such investigations. A
major obstacle is the chelation of metals by these ligands
within the chromatographic system and in biological
materials, which results in significant difficulties in both
sample preparation and LC-MS analysis.
Hence, the aim of this study was to investigate the
pharmacological properties (metabolism and disposition)
of the lead first and second generation DpT analogues
(i.e., Dp44mT and DpC) in-vivo using a new UHPLCMS/MS method. Besides comparison of pharmacokinetic
profiles of both compounds, their propensity towards invivo metabolism was studied and the pharmacodynamic
and toxicodynamic effects of the detected and predicted
metabolites were tested in-vitro.

Identification of the principal in-vivo metabolites
of Dp44mT and DpC in plasma after
administration to rats
The metabolism of both Dp44mT and DpC are
crucial to understand in terms of their differential activity
in vivo and facilitating the entrance of DpC into clinical
trials [1-6]. Considering this, after administration of
Dp44mT to rats, we found a significant amount of
a metabolite (m/z 272) in the plasma (Supplemental
Figure 1A). This was hypothesized to be a product due
to N-demethylation, namely, Dp4mT (Figure 1C). The
relatively higher retention of Dp4mT (relative retention of
1.17) as compared to Dp44mT was rather unusual and the
reason for this observation remains unclear (Supplemental
Figure 1A).
In contrast to Dp44mT, after administration of
DpC, only a minor peak of a metabolite (m/z 322) was
identified in the plasma (Supplemental Figure 1B). This
molecule corresponded to the oxidative desulfuration
of the thiourea structural moiety of DpC, resulting
in
N-cyclohexyl-N’-(di(pyridin-2-yl)methylene)-Nmethylformohydrazonamide (DpC-A; Figure 1C).
Notably, this metabolite was previously detected in our
in-vitro metabolism study of DpC using human liver
microsomes/S9 fractions [18].

Investigation of the possible metabolic
transformation of Dp44mT and DpC in cancer
and cardiac cells in-vitro
Considering the results after the administration
of Dp44mT and DpC to rats, studies then assessed
their metabolism in-vitro. Only a few rather minor
peaks of the putative metabolites were found after
incubation of the thiosemicarbazones with either
MCF-7 (Supplemental Figures 2 and 3) or H9c2 cells
(data not shown). Besides DpC-A (m/z 322; Figure
1C) found in this study in rat plasma, we detected
other products of oxidative desulfuration of the
thiosemicarbazone moiety. These included: di(2-pyridyl)
ketone 4-cyclohexyl-4-methylsemicarbazone (DpC-S;
m/z 338, Supplemental Figure 4A) and di(2-pyridyl)
ketone 4,4-dimethylsemicarbazone (Dp44mS; m/z 270;
Supplemental Figure 4A). In addition, we observed
minor cleavage of the hydrazone bond to liberate di(2pyridyl)ketone (DpK; m/z 185, Supplemental Figure 4A).
Importantly, all compounds detected in the cells incubated
with the thiosemicarbazones were also found in the control
(cell-free) media and PBS buffer incubated with Dp44mT
and DpC at approximately the same ratio to the parent

thiosemicarbazones (Supplemental Figures 2 and 3). This
finding suggests that all these compounds were formed by
slow chemical decomposition of the thiosemicarbazones
during the incubation at 37°C and that the MCF-7 or H9c2
cell lines did not show any distinct metabolic contribution
to this process.

Liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) to dichloromethane
showed higher recovery (>50%), but it suffered from
poor reproducibility. Finally, we developed a procedure
combining PP and LLE that provided higher extraction
efficiency and reproducibility over any other sample pretreatment technique examined. We demonstrated that the
presence of large amounts of EDTA, as well as the addition
of another thiosemicarbazone (namely, Dp4eT; [5]) prior
to protein precipitation, improved the reproducibility of
the extraction.
The developed UHPLC-MS/MS assay met general
validation criteria that corresponded to FDA guidelines
[21]. Selectivity was confirmed with no significant
interference from the matrix being detected (Figure 2B,
2D). Linearity, precision, accuracy, recovery and matrix
effect of the methods are documented in Supplementary
Tables 1-2. No significant decomposition of the
compounds (i.e., Dp44mT, Dp4mT, DpC and DpC-A) was
observed either up to 7 days stored at -80°C or after 24 h
storage in the autosampler at 10°C (Supplementary Table
3). A dilution integrity test proved acceptable precision
and accuracy (Supplementary Table 3) [21].

Development and validation of a UHPLC-MS/MS
method for the pharmacokinetic experiments
Following the identification of the major in-vivo
metabolites (Dp4mT for Dp44mT and DpC-A for DpC),
the development and validation of a fast UHPLC-MS/
MS assay of these compounds in plasma was performed.
The UHPLC column was selected based on our previous
experience [18] and the mobile phase composition was
optimized to reach acceptable separation of all compounds
during a reasonable run time (up to 10 min). Utilization of
EDTA in several steps of the analysis was recognized as
a key point in the reduction of metal complex formation
from the ligands during chromatography to enable
sufficient sensitivity, reproducibility and overall acceptable
chromatography. Exposure of the MS instrument to EDTA
was limited by employment of a switching valve.
A
structurally-related
compound,
(Z)-2benzoylpyridine 4-ethylsemicarbazone, was found to be
an optimal internal standard (I.S.; Figure 1B) for both
Dp44mT and DpC. The representative chromatograms
from the UHPLC-MS/MS analyses are illustrated in
Figure 2. These include analysis of Dp44mT and its
metabolite, Dp4mT, in plasma along with the I.S. (Figure
2A), relative to the corresponding blank (Figure 2B). In
addition, a UHPLC-MS/MS chromatogram is shown that
demonstrates DpC, DpC-A and the I.S. in plasma (Figure
2C) relative to the corresponding blank (Figure 2D).
Considering the sample preparation of rat plasma
prior analysis, both protein precipitation (PP) and solidphase extraction (SPE) provided only poor extraction
recovery (≤ 44 and 40% for PP and SPE, respectively).

The compounds were incubated with cells for 72 h/37°C. Cell proliferation/viability was determined using the MTT
assay and the IC50 values (half-maximal inhibitory concentrations) were calculated using CalcuSyn 2.0 software. Data are
presented as mean ± S.D. (n > 4).
despite the fact that the study conditions were identical
between the two agents. This observation demonstrated
that despite their clear structural similarity (Figure 1A), the
compounds showed markedly different pharmacokinetics
in-vivo. The relatively slow decrease of the mean DpC
concentrations required additional experiments to describe
the elimination phase of the concentration-time profile.
Considering this, sampling was then continued for up to
30 h (Group 2; Figure 3B).

and parent compound (Dp44mT) confirmed that Dp4mT is
an important metabolite. Furthermore, it is notable that the
metabolite achieved its Cmax soon after the administration
of the drug (Tmax = 10 min; Table 1).
For DpC, only a formohydrazonamide metabolite
was detected in the plasma (DpC-A; Figure 1C), but
only in very small amounts (well below the LLOQ of
the method). Hence, the maximal estimated AUC of the
formohydrazonamide metabolite was lower than 1%
of that of the parent drug, which suggests it is of minor
importance.

Non-compartmental pharmacokinetic analysis

Population pharmacokinetic analysis

The pharmacokinetic characteristics estimated
using non-compartmental analysis (NCA) of the mean
concentration profiles are listed in Table 1. The mean
extrapolated AUC of both agents (8 and 19% for Dp44mT
and DpC, respectively) confirmed that the blood sampling
was sufficient for the analysis. Comparison of these data
for both agents also indicated marked differences in
their total AUC, clearance and half-lives of elimination.
Comparison of Cmax and AUC of the metabolite, Dp4mT,
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Statistical evaluation and graphical inspection
of the goodness-of-fit plots indicated that the plasma
concentrations of Dp44mT, as well as DpC, are well
described by an open two-compartment model with firstorder elimination from the central compartment (Figure
3). The goodness-of-fit plots demonstrate that the data
were well described by the population models (Figure 4).

The statistical summary of post hoc Bayesian estimates
for individual pharmacokinetic parameters are given in
Table 2. Individually predicted concentrations of both
compounds agreed well with the observed values: the
mean prediction error achieved was -2.4% (95% CI: -9.34.5) and -0.4% (95% CI: -2.1-1.4), for Dp44mT and DpC,
respectively. The mean absolute prediction errors were
16.8% (95% CI: 12.6-21.1) and 6.9 % (95% CI: 6.0-7.8)
for Dp44mT and DpC, respectively.
Examining the Bayesian estimates for the
pharmacological parameters of Dp44mT and DpC, the
dose-corrected individual Cmax was higher for DpC than
Dp44mT (by 80%, p<0.01; Table 2). In contrast, the
Tmax values and volumes of the central compartment
(Vc) were similar. On the other hand, both compounds
differed in the volume of their peripheral compartments
(Vp) and inter-compartmental (distribution) clearance
(Q), with both indices being much higher for Dp44mT
(Table 2). The latter parameter also corresponded with
the markedly shorter t1/2α observed for Dp44mT relative
to DpC. However, Dp44mT also showed much lower

dose-corrected total AUC (28-fold), higher clearance (23fold) and markedly shorter (6.3-fold) terminal half-life of
elimination (t1/2β), as compared to DpC (Table 2).

Anti-proliferative activities and toxicities of

Next, the effects of the parent compounds (Dp44mT
and DpC) and their metabolites (Dp4mT and DpC-A)
on the proliferation/viability of cancer cell lines (HL60, MCF-7 and HCT116) and non-cancer cell lines
(H9c2 and 3T3) were assessed. As metabolism of the
thiosemicarbazones could be species-dependent, the
same experiments were also done with other compounds
detected in this study in-vitro (i.e., DpK, Dp44mS
and DpC-S), as well as those previously observed in

incubations with a human microsome/S9 fraction [18].
These experiments provided additional information of
pharmacological activity and toxicity of the metabolites
that could occur in other animal species. Furthermore,
these results may help to elucidate the differential toxicity
and efficacy of Dp44mT relative to DpC [2, 6]. The results
of these experiments are shown in the Supplementary
Tables and Supplemental Figures. These studies were done
to understand the potential biological activity of these
metabolites, which could contribute to the overall efficacy
or toxicity of the parent agents, Dp44mT or DpC.
Dp44mT was highly cytotoxic against all cancer
cells examined, where the IC50 values ranged from 2
to 9 nmol·L-1 (Figure 5A and Table 3). In contrast, it
showed only moderate cytotoxicity towards non-cancer
H9c2 myoblasts (IC50 = 124 ± 49 nmol·L-1), as well as
3T3 fibroblasts (IC50 = 157 ± 51 nmol·L-1). The major

metabolite of Dp44mT in rats, Dp4mT, showed significant
activity only in the HL-60 cell line (IC50 = 0.250 ± 0.055
μmol·L-1), while in other cancer cells, the IC50 values
ranged from 1.7 to 4.1 μmol·L-1 and this was comparable
to its anti-proliferative activity in non-cancer cells (Figure
5B and Table 3). These results corresponded to previous
studies demonstrating the markedly lower activity of
Dp4mT relative to Dp44mT in a range of neoplastic cell

DpC showed anti-cancer efficacy comparable
with Dp44mT against cancer cells and decreased antiproliferative activity against non-cancer cells (Table
3). The IC50 values of DpC against cancer cells ranged
from 3 to 5 nmol·L-1, while its IC50 value against noncancer cell lines was 85 and 412 nmol·L-1 for H9c2 and
3T3 cells, respectively (Figure 5C and Table 3). The
formohydrazonamide metabolite (DpC-A) was relatively

ineffective (IC50 ≥ 19 µmol·L-1) against all cancer cell lines
and was also non-toxic (IC50 ≥ 257 µmol·L-1) towards noncancer cells (Figure 5D and Table 3).
All other putative metabolites and products of
chemical degradation in the medium of both compounds
were found to be markedly less toxic against both
cancer and non-cancer cells in comparison with the
parent thiosemicarbazones (Supplemental Figure 5 and
Supplementary Table 4).

Fe release relative to the control, being approximately
half as effective as Dp44mT, while the activity of DpK
was no greater than the control (Supplemental Figure 6C).
On the other hand, the predicted DpC metabolite, DpC-S,
demonstrated efficacy that was comparable to DpC, and
markedly and significantly (p<0.001) increased 59Fe
mobilization relative to the control (Supplemental Figure
6D).
In terms of the activity of these predicted
metabolites at inhibiting internalized 59Fe uptake from
59
Fe-transferrin, Dp44mS reduced 59Fe uptake to 64% of
the control and was significantly (p<0.001) less effective
than Dp44mT (Supplemental Figure 6E). In contrast, DpK
did not have any significant (p>0.05) effect on 59Fe uptake
(p>0.05) relative to the control (Supplemental Figure 6E).
The activity of DpC-S at reducing 59Fe uptake from 59Fetransferrin was marked and similar to DpC, resulting in
a significant decrease (p<0.001) relative to the control
(Supplemental Figure 6F).

Intracellular labile iron chelation efficacy and the
ability of Dp44mT, DpC and their metabolites to
increase cellular iron mobilization and reduce
iron uptake from transferrin
As iron chelation efficacy plays a significant role
in the anti-proliferative activity of these and related
ligands [2, 5, 22], studies were performed to assess their
interaction with cellular iron pools that are essential for
growth. The calcein-AM assay demonstrated the high
intracellular chelation efficacy of Dp44mT (Figure 6A),
while its main metabolite, Dp4mT, showed significantly
lower relative efficacy (32% of Dp44mT chelation
activity; Figure 6A). Notably, DpC showed intracellular
chelation efficacy comparable to Dp44mT (Figure 6B),
while its metabolite, DpC-A, showed only negligible
chelation efficacy in this assay (2.5% of DpC chelation
activity; Figure 6B). This is probably due to the loss of
thiocarbonyl group in DpC-A (Figure 1C), which is a key
site required for metal ion ligation [2].
Dp44mT also induced a significant (p < 0.001)
increase in 59Fe mobilization from MCF-7 cancer cells
prelabeled with 59Fe-transferrin (51% of cellular 59Fe;
Figure 6C) relative to the control and similar results were
also observed with its main metabolite, Dp4mT (Figure
6C). Notably, DpC was also very effective in this assay,
mobilizing 44% of cellular 59Fe, while in contrast, its
metabolite, DpC-A, was comparable (p > 0.05) to the
control medium (Figure 6D). The ability of these agents to
prevent 59Fe uptake from 59Fe-transferrin (Figure 6E, 6F)
corresponded well with the results of the 59Fe mobilization
studies. That is, the compounds with high activity at
mobilizing 59Fe from MCF7 cells also had marked efficacy
at preventing 59Fe uptake from 59Fe-transferrin by cells
(Figure 6E, 6F).
Additional experiments with the other potential
metabolites (i.e., DpK, Dp44mS, DpC-S; Supplemental
Figure 4A) using the calcein-AM assay showed their
lower ability to bind intracellular Fe than their parent
ligands, namely Dp44mT or DpC (Supplemental Figure
6A and 6B). The iron chelation efficacy of these predicted
metabolites was then assessed using the more sensitive
methods of assessing 59Fe mobilization or inhibition of
59
Fe uptake in MCF-7 cells. These studies demonstrated
that Dp44mS significantly (p<0.001) increased cellular

DISCUSSION
In this study, we found that the first and second
generation ligands of the DpT series (namely, Dp44mT
and DpC, respectively [2, 5, 6]) differ markedly in their
metabolic profiles in rats in-vivo. Whereas Dp44mT was
subjected to a pronounced single demethylation at the
terminal N4 position, no such biotransformation occurred
in the case of DpC. This suggests that the bulky cyclohexyl
substitution of the tertiary nitrogen in DpC (Figure
1A) may sterically hinder the access of N-dealkylation
enzymes (predominantly cytochrome P450 [23]) to this
site. Hence, this structural difference leads to DpC being
metabolically more stable. In fact, we detected only minor
amounts of formamidrazone-like metabolite, indicating
negligible oxidation of the thiocarbonyl moiety in rats invivo. A similar biotransformation pathway was previously
reported for the related compound, 2-benzoylpyridine
4-ethyl-3-thiosemicarbazone (Bp4eT) in rats [24], where
an amidrazone metabolite was identified in plasma.
However, Bp4eT was markedly more prone to this
metabolism pathway than DpC, with the AUC of the
metabolite representing ≈ 20% of the parent drug [24].
In the current investigation, special attention was
also paid to the search for products of hydrolysis of the
hydrazone bond (namely, DpK), as this was previously
shown to largely determine the short elimination half-life
of the related aroylhydrazone chelators in rabbits (18-25
min) [25]. It is noteworthy that the present study confirmed
that novel thiosemicarbazones did not suffer from the
same problem. We identified only an insignificant amount
of DpK in cells and cell media after in-vitro incubations
with DpC or Dp44mT and were unable to detect any in the
plasma taken in the PK experiments using rats. This is also
in line with our previous work documenting the improved
hydrolytic stability of different thiosemicarbazones over

aroylhydrazone chelators in plasma and other biological
materials in-vitro [26]. In addition, the markedly longer
elimination half-lives observed for both DpC and Dp44mT
suggest that significant plasma instability of these agents
did not occur.
Our data also indicated that DpC or Dp44mT do
not undergo significant metabolism in either cancer
cells or heart-derived myoblasts. This largely excludes
the possibility that these metabolites play a role in the
pharmacological or toxicological effects ascribed to the
parent compounds [1, 2, 5, 6]. While this class of DpT
analogues can effectively redox cycle after chelating Fe or
Cu in cells and this participates in their anti-cancer activity
[3, 8], the lack of metabolites indicates that they are not
significantly degraded by the redox stress that is induced.
These findings also provide additional support to previous
studies examining the cellular uptake of 14C-radiolabeled
thiosemicarbazones and confirm that the total radioactivity
measured in cancer cells is related to the parent compound
and not its metabolites [27]. Notably, we also documented
the slow chemical hydrolysis of Dp44mT and DpC in
cell culture media and pharmacological evaluation of the
hydrolytic products excluded their important role in the
toxicity or efficacy of the parent compounds. Hence, both
Dp44mT and DpC are highly stable compounds.
Identification of the principal metabolites
in-vivo is essential for the subsequent targeted
development and validation of quantitative assays
for both thiosemicarbazones and their metabolites.
We demonstrated that the low sensitivity and poor
reproducibility initially encountered when designing these
quantitative assays is likely due to the complexation of
metal ions by these thiosemicarbazones during sample
pre-treatment and/or within the chromatographic system.
This property significantly complicated UHPLC-MS/
MS assay of these agents in plasma. Significantly, our
experiments revealed that the addition of another strong
ligand (preferably EDTA) to all steps of analysis was
beneficial for achieving reproducible results with sufficient
sensitivity. Although the use of non-volatile salts mainly
in the mobile phase is generally discouraged in MS-based
assays, we did not observed any detrimental effects on the
detector when a switching valve was employed, which is
in line with the observations of others [28, 29].
The developed method allowed appropriate
description of plasma concentration-time profiles
after i.v. administration of both drugs to rats.
Pharmacokinetic analyses of the data were performed
using non-compartmental analysis and two-compartmental
population analysis, both of which yielded very similar
or complementary results. Unlike Dp44mT, two groups
of animals were required to fully describe the PK profile
of DpC due to the markedly prolonged elimination phase.
The maximum concentrations of both compounds in the
plasma were in the micromolar range with a slight (2fold) difference in the dose-corrected Cmax. Importantly,
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

these peak concentrations are nearly three orders of
magnitude higher than their IC50 values determined invitro using different cancer cell lines in this investigation
and previous studies [2]. This observation may, in part,
explain the marked efficacy of these thiosemicarbazones
against a range of different tumor-types in-vivo [1, 2, 5, 6].
As a consequence of the pronounced difference in
total clearance, the characteristic of total exposure (AUC/
dose) to DpC largely exceeded that of Dp44mT (>20-fold;
Table 2), and importantly, almost identical data regarding
the clearance of DpC were obtained with another rat strain
(i.e., Lewis rats, n = 8; data not shown). In contrast to DpC,
Dp44mT was eliminated very effectively, as demonstrated
by the total clearance (4.3-4.8 L.h-1.kg-1) approaching
the sum of the liver and kidney blood perfusion rates in
rats (3.3 and 2.2 L.h-1.kg-1, respectively [30]). The much
higher clearance of Dp44mT relative to DpC may be at
least partially explained by the rapid demethylation of the
former agent.
The estimates for the volumes of distribution from
the two-compartmental model provided evidence of rapid
and extensive distribution of both drugs into tissues,
which corresponds with their lipophilic nature and ability
to easily and rapidly cross biological membranes [2,
27]. In fact, the initial (central) volumes of distribution
exceeded both the volume of the circulation and also
heavily perfused organs. Notably, there was a considerable
difference in the volume of the peripheral compartment
between Dp44mT and DpC (Table 2). However, the actual
differences in tissue concentrations between these two
compounds requires direct verification, as it depends on
their overall partition coefficients between the plasma and
other tissues (KP = fU,P/fU,T) [31]. In the case of Dp44mT,
a large fraction of the administered dose was eliminated
before reaching pseudo-equilibrium, and unlike DpC, this
resulted in the numerical value of Vz >> Vss = (VP+VT)
where Vz and Vss represent the apparent volumes of
distribution in terminal and steady state, respectively,
and VP and VT are the volume of plasma and tissue,
respectively.
Comparison of the PK parameters of both parent
compounds in the present study to those of a related
thiosemicarbazone, namely Bp4eT, previously reported
in studies using rats [32], revealed several differences. In
particular, Bp4eT showed an approximate 2-fold higher
dose-corrected Cmax, but simultaneously slightly shorter
elimination half-life (1.4 h) [32]. Hence, the elimination
of both Dp44mT and Bp4eT was much faster than
that of DpC, which may correspond with their higher
propensity for metabolic elimination. The elimination
of DpC may also differ from the clinically investigated
thiosemicarbazone, Triapine® [33]. In fact, while no
preclinical data on the pharmacokinetics are available
in the literature for this latter drug, the half-life of
elimination after a single i.v. bolus was determined to be
approximately 1 h in humans [33]. The only reference to its
42421

Oncotarget

metabolism in-vivo describes the presence of hydroxylated
or acetylated metabolites in the urine of Triapine®-treated
patients [34]. Collectively, it can be suggested that even
a relatively minor change in the chemical structure of
thiosemicarbazones can have significant consequences on
their pharmacokinetics. This observation indicates that it
may be feasible to further optimize their PK properties via
structural modifications to enhance efficacy.
Our in-vitro data showed little to no antiproliferative activity of the demethylated Dp44mT
metabolite, Dp4mT, in-vitro at the range of concentrations
achievable via Dp44mT metabolism in-vivo. Markedly
lower anti-cancer efficacy of this metabolite relative to the
parent compound may correspond with the lower ability of
Dp4mT to bind Fe from cellular pools, as documented by
the calcein assay in the present study. On the contrary, we
observed the similar capability of the metabolite and the
parent drug to mobilize 59Fe from MCF-7 cells and prevent
59
Fe uptake from 59Fe-transferrin, which corresponds with
previous studies using SK-N-MC neuroepithelioma cells
[5]. The discrepancy between these iron chelation assays
may be explained by: (1) the limited drug exposure times
in the calcein assay, which need not reflect the cumulative
ability of the drug to mobilize 59Fe out of the cells after
longer incubations; (2) the greater sensitivity of the
radioisotope method using 59Fe relative to the calcein
assay; and (3) the potentially different iron pools being
estimated by the calcein and radioisotope methods. The
significantly lower efficacy in intracellular chelation of Fe
by Dp4mT relative to Dp44mT measured by the calcein
assay better correlates with the decreased anti-proliferative
activity of Dp4mT (Table 3). Of note, toxicity of the
metabolite, Dp4mT, towards H9c2 myoblasts was an
order of magnitude lower in comparison with Dp44mT,
which suggests that Dp4mT is unlikely to be responsible
for cardiotoxicity previously reported with Dp44mT after
high, non-optimal doses [1].
The metabolism of DpC to the formohydrazonamide
compound (DpC-A) led to significant attenuation of
cytotoxic activity (Table 3), which is in line with the loss
of Fe chelation efficacy observed in all Fe chelation assays
(Figure 6). This is likely to be associated with the loss of
the ligating sulfur atom, which is crucial in terms of Fe
chelation [2]. Very low concentrations of this metabolite
in plasma in-vivo (Supplemental Figure 1B), along with
its negligible cytotoxicity (Table 3), strongly suggests
that metabolism of DpC to DpC-A is unlikely to have any
significant impact on the overall efficacy or safety of the
drug.
In conclusion, this study demonstrates for the first
time that the lead compounds of the first (Dp44mT) and
second (DpC) generations of the DpT analogues differ
considerably in their propensity towards biotransformation
in rats. The rapid demethylation of Dp44mT to the
metabolite, Dp4mT, may be involved in the markedly
higher clearance, shorter half-life of elimination and
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

smaller AUC in comparison to DpC. The metabolism
of Dp44mT to Dp4mT resulted in a loss of anti-cancer
activity, which may be associated with the lower chelation
efficacy of Dp4mT measured by the calcein assay. The
metabolite, Dp4mT, was relatively non-toxic to 3T3
fibroblasts and H9c2 cardiac myoblasts and did not
appear to be responsible for cardiotoxicity observed at
high, non-optimal doses of Dp44mT reported previously.
The plasma concentrations of both Dp44mT and DpC
markedly exceeded the effective IC50 values determined
in cancer cells which could, in part, explain the significant
activity of both agents in-vivo. However, the remarkably
higher and longer exposure period found for DpC further
highlights the in-vivo potential of this new lead compound.
These findings may help to refine appropriate dosing
schedules in-vivo and estimate PK/PD relationships.
Moreover, these data can accelerate advanced preclinical
development of DpC towards clinical evaluation and
enable the targeted optimization of PK properties of newly
developed thiosemicarbazones.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Chemicals
The thiosemicarbazones, Dp44mT, DpC, di(2pyridyl)ketone 4-ethyl-3-thiosemicarbazone (Dp4eT;
Supplemental Figure 4B) and (Z)-2-benzoylpyridine
4-ethylsemicarbazone (internal standard; I.S., Figure
1B) were synthesized and characterized, as described
previously [5, 6]. Other chemicals used for LC-MS
analysis and sample preparation (all of HPLC, gradient
or MS grade) as well as di(2-pyridyl)ketone (DpK,
Supplemental Figure 4A; purity: 99%) were obtained
from Sigma-Aldrich (Germany). Milli-Q water was
prepared using a Millipore purification system (MerckMillipore, Germany). Pooled blank rat plasma (with EDTA
as an anti-coagulant) was obtained from healthy rats as
described below. The ADS buffer (Millipore water (18.2
MΩ/cm) supplemented with 116 mM NaCl, 5.3 mM KCl,
1 mM CaCl2, 1.2 mM MgSO4, 1.13 mM NaH2PO4, 5 mM
D-glucose, and 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4) was prepared
according to a previously published procedure [35].

Synthesis of standards of putative metabolites
Di(2-pyridyl)ketone 4-methyl-3-thiosemicarbazone
(Dp4mT, Figure 1C) was prepared according to a
previously reported method [36]. Di(2-pyridyl)ketone
4,4-dimethylsemicarbazone (Dp44mS; Supplemental
Figure 4A) was synthesized by the reaction of di(2-pyridyl)
ketone (Sigma-Aldrich) and 4,4-dimethylsemicarbazone,
as described in the Supplementary Materials and
Methods. N-cyclohexyl-N’-(di(pyridin-2-yl)methylene)42422

N-methylformohydrazonamide (DpC-A, Figure 1C) was
prepared by the oxidation of the parent drug, DpC, with
hydrogen peroxide according to a procedure described
previously [32]. Di(2-pyridyl)ketone 4-cyclohexyl-4methylsemicarbazone (DpC-S; Supplemental Figure
4A) was prepared by the reaction of di(2-pyridyl)
ketone (Sigma-Aldrich, Germany) with 4-cyclohexyl-4methylsemicarbazide in ethanol.
The chemical structures described above and their
purities were confirmed by 1H and 13C NMR and MS-ESI+.

carotis were prepared for drug administration and blood
sample collection, respectively. Both Dp44mT and DpC
were dissolved in a mixture of saline, PEG 300 and
ethanol (5:4:1, v/v/v) and administered to rats at a dose of
2 mg.kg-1, as a slow i.v. bolus. Blood was then collected
into EDTA-containing tubes, immediately centrifuged
and the plasma kept at -80°C until being analyzed. The
blood withdrawn from animals was compensated with an
appropriate volume of saline. The animals were sacrificed
by pentobarbital overdose.
Initially, for both compounds, rats (n = 2, in each
group) were used for the in-vivo investigation of the
thiosemicarbazone metabolites and also the preparation of
the quantitative analytical method. For the full PK study,
6 rats were used for each compound (group 1) and the
blood was sampled at 4, 10, 30, 60, 120, 240 and 360 min
post-administration.
Due to the markedly slower elimination of DpC, an
additional in-vivo study was performed to appropriately
describe the elimination phase of this drug. The conscious
rats (n = 8, group 2) were administered DpC (2 mg.kg-1)
via slow i.v. bolus to the vena saphena. Blood was
sampled from the retro-orbital plexus under light ether
anesthesia during the following time intervals: 120, 360,
600, 1440 and 1800 min. Plasma samples were treated and
analyzed using the analytical methods described below in
the Section: UHPLC-MS/MS methods for quantitative
assay of the drugs and their metabolites.

Cell culture
The MCF-7 human breast adenocarcinoma cell
line was purchased from the European Collection of
Cell Cultures (U.K.). The HL-60 human promyelocytic
leukemia cell line, HCT116 human colorectal carcinoma
cell line, H9c2 rat heart-derived myoblast cell line and
3T3 mouse embryo fibroblast line, were obtained from
the American Type Culture Collection (VA, U.S.A.). Cells
were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium
(DMEM, Lonza, Switzerland) with or without (for MCF7 cells only) phenol red, supplemented with 10% heatinactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS; Lonza, Switzerland),
1% penicillin/streptomycin solution (Lonza, Switzerland)
and 10 mM HEPES buffer (pH 7.0-7.6; Sigma-Aldrich,
Germany). The HL-60 cell line was maintained in RPMI
medium (Sigma-Aldrich, Germany) supplemented with
10% heat-inactivated FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin
solution. All cell lines were cultured in 75 cm2 tissue
culture flasks (Switzerland) at 37°C in a humidified
atmosphere of 5% CO2. Sub-confluent cells or, in the case
of HL-60 cells, a cell suspension, were sub-cultured every
3‑4 days.

Pharmacokinetic analysis
Standard non-compartmental analysis was
performed implementing Kinetica software (version 4.0,
Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., MA, U.S.A.). Using naive
data pooling, these data were combined into a geometric
mean concentration-time curve from 6 animals per
sampling interval (Dp44mT and its metabolite, Dp4mT)
and from 6 to 14 animals per sampling interval (DpC).
Maximum concentration (Cmax) and the time to maximum
concentration (Tmax) were determined directly from the
geometric mean vs. time profiles and from individual
profiles. The area under the mean plasma concentration–
time curve from zero up to the last sampling interval
(AUC0-tlast) was calculated by a combination of the linear
and log-linear trapezoidal methods. The area under
the mean plasma concentration–time curve from zero
up to infinity (AUC) was determined as the sum of the
AUC0–tlast and of the extrapolated part (i.e., the ratio of the
concentration predicted at the time interval of tlast and the
terminal rate constant, λz). The λz was estimated by linear
regression of the log transformed concentrations in the
terminal part of the curve.
Population pharmacokinetic modeling was
performed using non-linear, mixed effect modeling as
implemented in Monolix, version 4 (http://wfn.software.
monolix.org). Pharmacokinetic parameters were estimated

Experimental animals
Male Wistar rats (230-310 g; n = 22) obtained from
Velaz (Czech Republic) were kept in an air-conditioned
room under a 12 h light-dark cycle, constant temperature
and humidity and had free access to water and a standard
laboratory pellet diet for rodents. All animal handling
and procedures were approved and supervised by the
Animal Welfare Body of the Faculty of Medicine in
Hradec Kralove, Charles University in Prague. The
investigation conformed to the Guide for the Care and Use
of Laboratory Animals [37].

by computing the maximum likelihood estimator of the
parameters without any approximation of the model (no
linearization). This was performed using the Stochastic
Approximation Expectation Maximization (SAEM)
algorithm combined with a Markov chain Monte Carlo
procedure. The between-animal variability in model
parameters were ascribed to an exponential model
and a proportional model was used to describe the
residual variability. The goodness-of-fit was assessed by
using several diagnostic plots (observed and predicted
concentrations vs. time; observed concentrations vs.
population predictions; weighted residuals vs. time; and
weighted residuals vs. predictions). Individual parameter
values were obtained as empirical Bayes estimates. Finally,
the predicted individual concentrations were compared
with the observed data using the mean prediction error and
the mean absolute prediction error.

with minor modifications [24] (for details of the analyses
see Supplementary Material, part 2.1). Importantly,
particular attention was paid to the metabolites predicted
previously from our in-vitro study [18]. The chemical
structures of metabolites were suggested based on MSn
experiments and subsequently confirmed using the HPLCMS analysis of the chemical standards synthesized for this
purpose.

UHPLC-MS/MS methods for quantitative assay
of the drugs and their metabolites
Stock solutions, working solutions and quality control
samples
Stock solutions (0.5 mg·mL-1) of all analytes
(Dp44mT, Dp4mT, DpC and DpC-A), internal standard
(I.S.) and auxiliary chelator (Dp4eT) were prepared
by dissolving the appropriate amount of each agent
in acetonitrile. Working solutions were then prepared
by gradual dilution of the stock solutions with 50%
acetonitrile until the desired concentrations were reached.
Quality control samples were prepared by addition of the
appropriate amount of working solutions to drug-free
plasma.

In-vitro study of metabolism of drugs in breast
cancer and cardiac myoblast cells
Breast cancer cells (MCF-7) and H9c2 heartderived myoblasts were seeded in 100-mm Petri dishes
(1,000,000 cells/dish) for 24 h/37oC. Freshly prepared
stock solutions of Dp44mT and DpC in DMSO (SigmaAldrich, Germany) were diluted in culture medium to the
required working concentration. The final concentrations
of DMSO in these later solutions did not exceed 0.1%,
which has been shown not to affect proliferation or cellular
metabolism [22].
The cells were incubated for 12 h (37 °C) with
either Dp44mT or DpC at a concentration of 10 μmol·L-1.
After this incubation, the cells were harvested, washed
twice with ice-cold PBS buffer, centrifuged (790 x g) and
precipitated with acetonitrile (200 μL/106 cells) prior to
the analysis. The overlaying medium was also analyzed
to search for possible metabolites. In order to determine
possible chemical decomposition, an identical protocol
was performed with control medium and PBS buffer
without cells. All samples were analyzed using HPLC-MS
as described below in the Section: HPLC-MS method to
identify metabolites of the drugs.

Sample preparation
Plasma samples were treated with a combined
protein precipitation and liquid-liquid extraction procedure
according to the following protocol. One microliter of
I.S. working solution (concentration of either 25 or 100
µmol·L-1 for Dp44mT or DpC, respectively) and 1 µL
of Dp4eT solution (100 µmol·L-1) were added to the
plasma samples (100 µL). The samples were then diluted
with 100 µL of 2% aqueous solution of K2EDTA and
mixed thoroughly. Thereafter, 200 µL of 1.25% NH4OH
in acetonitrile followed by 800 µL of dichloromethane
were added. This mixture was vortexed (5 min) and then
centrifuged (10 min; 16,800 × g; 20°C). The organic layer
was subsequently dried under a gentle flow of nitrogen.
The residuum was reconstituted in either 50 µL or 100
µL of a K2EDTA solution (250 µmol·L-1) in 50% aqueous
acetonitrile for Dp44mT or DpC, respectively, and
analyzed.

drugs

Chromatographic conditions and MS settings

To search for the metabolites, plasma was
precipitated with methanol or acetonitrile (plasma/solvent
ratio – 1:3, v/v), treated using solid phase extraction (SPE;
Discovery DSC-PH, Supelco, PA, U.S.A.), or liquid-liquid
extraction with various solvents (ethyl acetate, toluene,
dichloromethane) [24]. The cells and media were either
precipitated or diluted with acetonitrile. These samples
were then analyzed using HPLC-MS with ion trap mass

A Nexera UHPLC system coupled with LCMS-8030
triple quadrupole mass detector (both from Shimadzu,
Japan) was used operating in ESI positive mode. The
acquired data were processed using LabSolutions software
(v. 5.60 SP2, 2013, Shimadzu, Japan). All separations
were achieved on a column (Acquity UPLC® BEH C18

2 mmol·L-1 EDTA solution with acetonitrile (90:10, v/v)
prior to the first use. The mobile phase consisted of 2
mmol·L-1 ammonium formate aqueous solution with
the addition of K2EDTA (5 µmol·L-1, component A)
and acetonitrile (component B) in gradient mode (see
Supplementary Material, part 2.2). A switching valve
was used and the mobile phase was allowed to enter the
MS instrument merely for the time necessary for ESI
stabilization and compound detection. The following
conditions were used: a flow rate of 0.3 mL·min-1; an
autosampler temperature of 10°C; a column temperature
of 30°C; and injection volume of 4 µL. Prior to each
analytical run, a mixture of 4.5 mmol·L-1 or 3.5 mmol·L1
of K2EDTA in the mobile phase of Dp44mT or DpC,
respectively, was injected and eluted to waste. Quantitation
was performed in selected reaction monitoring mode
(SRM) using low resolution. The mass spectrometer
set-up and detailed SRM parameters are specified in the
Supplementary Materials and Methods (part 2.2).

MTT assays (Sigma-Aldrich, Germany) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions on a Tecan Infinite 200M
plate reader (Tecan, Austria). The proliferation/viability
of treated groups was expressed as a percentage of the
untreated controls (100%). The half maximal inhibitory
concentrations resulting in a 50% reduction of cellular
proliferation/viability (IC50) as compared to the untreated
control value, were calculated using CalcuSyn 2.0
software (Biosoft, U.K.).

Iron chelation efficacy, mobilization of 59Fe from
cells and 59Fe uptake from 59Fe-transferrin
Iron chelation efficiency of the compounds at
a concentration of 10 µmol·L-1 was determined via 3
methods: (1) the calcein assay; (2) the ability of the
ligands to induce 59Fe mobilization from cells prelabeled
with 59Fe-transferrin; and (3) the efficacy of these agents to
inhibit the uptake of 59Fe from 59Fe-transferrin [22, 38-40].
The fluorimetric calcein-AM assay was performed
by established methods, as described previously [38, 39].
The Fe chelation efficiency of the metabolites in cells was
expressed as a percentage of that of the parent chelator,
Dp44mT or DpC (100%). For studies assessing the ability
of these agents to induce 59Fe mobilization and inhibit 59Fe
uptake from 59Fe-transferrin by cells, human transferrin
(Sigma-Aldrich, Germany) was labeled with 59Fe
(PerkinElmer, MA, USA) to generate 59Fe-transferrin at
a final specific activity of 500 pCi/pmol Fe, as previously
described [22, 39, 40]. The unbound 59Fe was removed
by exhaustive vacuum dialysis against a large excess of
0.15 M NaCl buffered to pH 7.4 with 1.4% NaHCO3 by
standard methods [22, 40].
To examine the ability of the studied substances to
mobilize 59Fe from MCF-7 cells or inhibit 59Fe uptake from
59
Fe-transferrin, established techniques were utilized [22,
40]. For 59Fe mobilization studies, cells were preincubated
with 59Fe-transferrin (0.75 µmol·L-1) for 3 h/37°C, washed
4 times at 4°C on ice, and then reincubated with control
medium or control medium containing the compounds
(25 µmol·L-1) for 3 h/37°C. The release of 59Fe from
the cells into the overlying medium was then examined
by collecting both the cells and overlying medium and
assessing 59Fe levels using a γ-counter. For studies
examining the ability of the agents to inhibit 59Fe uptake
from 59Fe-transferrin, cells were incubated for 3 h/37°C
with 59Fe-transferrin (0.75 µmol·L-1) in the presence or
absence of the agents (25 µmol·L-1), and then washed 4
times at 4°C on ice. The internalization of 59Fe by cells
was then assessed by incubation for 30 min/4°C with the
general protease, Pronase (1 mg/mL), utilizing standard
techniques [22, 40]. The amount of internalized 59Fe in the
presence of the agents was expressed as a percentage of
59
Fe internalized by control cells incubated in the presence
of control media alone.

Method validation
The analytical methods were validated according
to the United States Food and Drug Administration
Guidelines (Bioanalytical Method Validation) [21] with
respect to selectivity, linearity, precision, accuracy,
stability, recovery, matrix effects and dilution integrity.
The following concentration ranges were used: 0.035-2
µmol·L-1 (Dp44mT and Dp4mT) and 0.150-3 µmol·L-1
(DpC and DpC-A). Details on validation procedures are
specified in the Supplementary Material.

Characterization of pharmacological properties of
the drugs and their metabolites in-vitro
Pharmacological properties of the following
agents were assessed: (1) the parent thiosemicarbazones
(Dp44mT and DpC); (2) their metabolites detected in
this study in plasma (Dp4mT, DpC-A); (3) their putative
metabolites (i.e. DpK, Dp44mS and DpC-S) identified
from in-vitro studies in cell culture media and cancer cells;
and (4) metabolites of these thiosemicarbazones identified
from our previous studies in-vitro [18].

Proliferation and cytotoxicity studies
Cells were seeded in 96-well plates for 24 h/37oC
at a density of 5,000 (MCF-7), 10,000 (HL-60), 2,000
(HCT116) and 10,000 (3T3 and H9c2) cells/well. For 3T3
and H9c2 cells, the medium was changed to serum- and
pyruvate-free DMEM 24 h prior to the experiments. Antiproliferative and cytotoxicity effects of the compounds
were studied at different concentrations after incubations
for 72 h/37oC. Viabilities of cells were determined using
