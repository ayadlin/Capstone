ABSTRACT
Bee venom (BV) has been used as a traditional medicine to treat arthritis,
rheumatism, back pain, cancerous tumors, and skin diseases. However, the effects of
BV on the colon cancer and their action mechanisms have not been reported yet. We
used cell viability assay and soft agar colony formation assay for testing cell viability,
electro mobility shift assay for detecting DNA binding activity of nuclear factor kappa B
(NF-κB) and Western blotting assay for detection of apoptosis regulatory proteins. We
found that BV inhibited growth of colon cancer cells through induction of apoptosis. We
also found that the expression of death receptor (DR) 4, DR5, p53, p21, Bax, cleaved
caspase-3, cleaved caspase-8, and cleaved caspase-9 was increased by BV treatment in
a dose dependent manner (0–5 μg/ml). Consistent with cancer cell growth inhibition,
the DNA binding activity of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) was also inhibited by BV
treatment. Besides, we found that BV blocked NF-κB activation by directly binding to
NF-κB p50 subunit. Moreover, combination treatment with BV and p50 siRNA or NF-κB
inhibitor augmented BV-induced cell growth inhibition. However, p50 mutant plasmid
(C62S) transfection partially abolished BV-induced cell growth inhibiton. In addition, BV
significantly suppressed tumor growth in vivo. Therefore, these results suggested that BV
could inhibit colon cancer cell growth, and these anti-proliferative effects may be related
to the induction of apoptosis by activation of DR4 and DR5 and inhibition of NF-κB.

environmental factors such as western style dietary
habits, low fiber intake, tobacco-smoking, high fat diet,
low calcium/micronutrient intake and lack of physical
activities [3]. However, there are also negative studies on
fat, fiber and calcium in colon cancer development [4]. In
addition, colon cancer is a heterogeneous disease. There
is evidence that lifestyle factors like diet can modulate
the course of this disease [5].
Constitutive activation of Nuclear Factor-κB (NF-κB)
has been described in a great number of tumors including
colon tumors. Human colon cancer cell lines and tumor

INTRODUCTION
Colon cancer is one of the major causes of
cancer-related deaths in the world [1]. Colon cancer
has an estimated incidence of over 1,000,000 new
cases annually worldwide. Almost one of three patients
with colon cancer dies from the disease. Colon cancer
also more often affects people of well-developed
countries in comparison to less developed countries
[2]. Several epidemiological and laboratory studies
have demonstrated the association of colon cancer with

sporadic adenomatous polyps showed increased NF-κB
activity [6, 7]. The inhibition of NF-κB has shown remarkable
anti-tumor activity in preclinical and clinical studies [8]. NFκB signaling has a pivotal role in cancer development and
progression. NF-κB provides a mechanistic link between
inflammation and cancer, and is a major factor controlling
the ability of both pre-neoplastic and malignant cells to resist
apoptosis-based tumor-surveillance mechanisms [9]. NF-κB
might also regulate tumor angiogenesis and invasiveness,
and the signaling pathways that adjust its activation
provide attractive targets for new chemo-preventive and
chemotherapeutic approaches [10]. A number of reports have
shown that NF-κB is inhibited by apoptosis-inducing agents
in human colon cancer cells [11, 12]. NF-κB acts as a cell
survival factor through its regulatory role in the expression
of an array of apoptotic (caspase-3 and Bax), antiapoptotic
(Bcl-2 and IAP family), and cell proliferation genes
(cyclooxygenase-2 and cyclins) [13]. Therefore, inhibition of
NF-κB by chemotherapeutics is intended as a new strategy
to eliminate cancerous cells through induction of apoptosis.
Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing
ligand (TRAIL) induces apoptosis in cancer cells
without toxicity to normal cells. It is well known that
TRAIL binds to DRs, TRAIL-R1 (DR4) and TRAIL-R2
(DR5) expressed on cancer cell surface and activates
apoptotic pathways. When DRs bind to their ligands, the
death domains recruit the intracellular adaptor protein
(Fas-associated death domain protein) which results in
the activation of capase-8 that leads to the activation of
downstream caspases, including capase-3, caspase-9 and
Bax [14]. It is documented that the resistance of cancer
cells is related to the activation of NF-κB and downregulation of DRs; thus, down-regulation of NF-κB and
up-regulation of DRs are implicated in the development
of new anti-cancer treatment for chemo-resistant cancer
cells. It has been demonstrated that up-regulation of DRs
and inactivation of NF-κB are reciprocally associated
in chemoresistance. Many chemotherapeutic agents
or natural compounds such as garicinol, zerumbone,
quercetin, snake venom toxin inhibit cancer cell growth
via overexpression of death receptor associated with
down-regulation of NF-κB [15–18]. In agreement
with this notion, it is possible that BV could overcome
resistance to TRAIL through inactivation of NF-κB and
activation of DRs.
BV contains a variety of different peptides, including
melittin (a major component of BV), apamin, adolapin, and
mast cell degranulating peptide [19, 20]. BV has anti-cancer
activity [21]. Melittin, a major polypeptide of BV, is thought
to function as a lytic agent that has been used traditionally
against chronic inflammation and cancer [22] and also
used for the therapeutic agent of arthritis, rheumatism,
atherosclerosis, and cancer in traditional medicine [23, 24].
Melittin inhibited the DNA-binding and transcriptional
activity of NF-κB, an important transcriptional factor
regulating inflammatory gene expression, through the
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

suppression of IκB phosphorylation and the decrease in the
translocation of the p50 and p65 subunits of NF-κB [25].
However, the anti-cancer effect of BV on colon cancer cells
has not been studied yet. In this study, we investigated anticancer effects and possible mechanisms of BV on colon
cancer cells. In particular, we determined the capacity of
the BV induced apoptotic effect through activation of DRs
and suppression of NF-κB.

RESULTS
Effect of BV on the growth of colon cancer cells
To evaluate the effect of BV on the growth of colon
cancer cells, we analyzed cell viability using the MTT assay.
BV (0–10 μg/ml) inhibited the growth of human colon
cancer cells, and the IC50 values of HCT116 (Figure 1A)
and SW480 (Figure 1B) were 8.2 and 7.8 μg/ml,
respectively. We evaluated changes in the morphology of
human colon cancer cells using phasecontrast microscopy.
BV-treated SW480 cells for 48 h showed rounded
morphology and tended to detach from substratum.
However, BV-treated HCT116 cells for 48 h presented
with membrane blebbing, cell shrinkage, cytoplasmic
increasing density and irregularity in shape. (0–10 μg/ml)
To evaluate the effect of BV on the colon epithelial normal
cells, we treated FHC with BV (0–10 μg/ml) for 24 h,
and BV showed no toxicity at all (Figure 1C). To further
demonstrate the inhibitory effect of BV on cancer cell
growth, we performed the soft agar colony formation assay.
The number of colonies was concentration-dependently
decreased by BV (Figure 1D), and the concentration
of BV for inhibition of colony formation was similar to
the cell growth inhibition. To determine whether the
inhibition of cell growth by BV treatment was due to
induction of apoptosis, we evaluated the changes in colon
cancer cells by using DAPI staining followed by TUNEL
assays, and then the double labeled cells were analyzed
by fluorescence microscope. The cells were treated with
BV (0–5 μg/ml) for 24 h. DAPI-stained TUNEL-positive
cells were concentration-dependently increased and the
highest concentration of BV (5 μg/ml) caused most of
cells TUNEL-positive, and apoptosis rates were 91.35%
in HCT116 cells (Figure 2A) and 87.23% in SW480 cells
(Figure 2B). These results demonstrated that BV treatment
strongly induced apoptosis in colon cancer cells.

Effect of BV on the expression of apoptosis
regulatory proteins
To figure out the relationship between the induction
of apoptosis and the expression of apoptosis regulatory
protein by BV, the expression of apoptosis related intrinsic
pathway (Figure 3A) and extrinsic pathway (Figure 3B)
proteins was investigated. With the treatment of BV
(0–5 μg/ml) in HCT116 and in SW480 colon cancer cells,

we found that the expression of pro-apoptotic proteins
such as Bax, cleaved caspase-3, cleaved caspase-8 and
cleaved caspase-9 as well as the expression of DRs like

dependent manner. However, the expression of antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 was decreased.

of NF-κB was supershifted by p50 specific antibody in
HCT116 colon cancer cells (Figure 4C).

Effect of BV on NF-κB activation

To determine the effect of DR4, DR5 and their
ligand TRAIL on the BV-induced apoptotic cell death, we
performed siRNA transfection and MTT assay. Cells were
transfected with DR4 siRNA, DR5 siRNA and TRAIL
siRNA by a transfection agent for 24 h, and then were
treated with BV (5 μg/ml) for another 24 h. Cell viability
was determined by MTT assay. As a result, combination
treatment with BV and DR4 or DR5 or TRAIL siRNA
transfection partially abolished BV-induced cell growth
inhibiton (Figure 5A). Besides, the expression of DR4
was significantly decreased by DR4 siRNA transfection
and the expression of DR5 was significantly decreased by
DR5 siRNA transfection (Figure 5B).

and TRAIL siRNA on BV-induced cell growth

NF-κB plays a significant role in colon cancer
cell growth. To investigate whether BV inactivates NFκB, we performed EMSA for detecting DNA binding
activity of NF-κB. We found that BV-untreated colon
cancer cells showed highly constituted activation of NFκB in both colon cancer cells. However, BV treatment
concentration dependently inhibited DNA binding activity
of NF-κB (Figure 4A). Agreed with the inhibition of
NF-κB, cytosolic phosphorylation of IκB as well as the
nucleus translocation of p50 and p65 was inhibited by BV
treatment in both colon cancer cells (Figure 4B). The band

mutant plasmid (C62S) transfection partially abolished
BV-induced cell growth inhibiton (Figure 5C), and
BV-induced expression of DR4 and DR5 was partially
prevented (Figure 5D).

To further investigate whether NF-κB plays a critical
role in BV-induced up-regulation of DR4 and DR5 as well
as colon cancer cell growth inhibition, we pretreated the
colon cancer cells with phenylarsine oxide (PAO), an NFκB inhibitor (0.1 μM) for 1 h, and then these cells were
treated with BV (1 μg/ml) for 24 h to assess cell growth,
and DR4 and DR5 expression. We also knocked down
p50 with p50 siRNA by a transfection agent for 24 h,
and then treated the transfected cells with BV (5 μg/ml).

result, combination treatment with BV and p50 siRNA
transfection augmented BV-induced cell growth inhibition
(Figure 6A), and the expression of p50 translocation to

combination treatment with BV and NF-κB inhibitor
(PAO) magnified BV-induced cell growth inhibtion

and DR5 by BV was suppressed by transfection with p53
siRNA both in HCT116 and SW480 cells (Figure 7B). To
further investigate whether p53 plays an important role
on BV-induced cell growth inhibition and up-regulation of
DR4 and DR5, we pretreated HCT116 and SW480 colon
cancer cells with 20 μM pifithrin-α, a p53 inhibitor for
1 h, and then these cells were treated with BV (2 μg/ml) for
24 h to assess cell viability and DR4 and DR5 expression.
As a result, p53 inhibitor partially abolished BV-induced
cell growth inhibition (Figure 7C) and suppressed the
BV-induced up-regulation of DR4 and DR5 (Figure 7D),
suggesting that p53-dependent apoptosis pathway may be
involved in BV-induced cell growth inhibition and upregulation of DR4 and DR5.

indicated that melittin bound with cell lysates containing
p50 from SW480 cells and p50 recombinant protein
(Figure 8B). To identify the binding site of melittin to
p50, we performed computational docking experiments
with melittin and NF-κB p50 subunit. Melittin bound

HCT116 xenograft studies, BV (1 mg/kg) was administrated
intraperitoneally twice per week for 3 weeks to mice which
have tumors ranging from 100 to 150 mm3. Tumor volume
was measured twice a week, and all mice were sacrificed
at the end of experiment when tumors were dissected and
weighted. The inhibitory effect of BV on the growth of colon
tumor was significant in xenograft model mice (Figure 9A).
Tumor volume and weight were dose-dependently
decreased (Figure 9B and 9C). The immunohistochemistry
analysis of tumor section by hematoxylin and eosin staining
and proliferation antibodies against PCNA staining revealed
that BV (1 mg/kg) significantly suppressed tumor growth,
and the expression level of DR4, DR5 and active caspase-3
was increased while the expression level of p50 was
decreased in nude mice xenograft tissues (Figure 9D).

DISCUSSION

Effect of BV on the expression of apoptosis
regulatory proteins and DNA binding activity of
NF-κB in colon tumor tissues

Although it has been previously reported that BV
can induce apoptosis in many cancer cell lines such as
lung cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, breast cancer,
prostate cancer and ovarian cancer cell lines [29–33],
there is no study on the effect of BV on colon cancer cell
lines. In this study, we demonstrated that BV inhibited
cancer cell growth in HCT116 and SW480 colon cancer
cells through activation of DR4 and DR5 and suppression
of NF-κB. Our present findings showed that BV inhibited
the growth of HCT116 and SW480 colon cancer cells in
a concentration dependent manner (0–5 μg/ml). However,

To examine the relationship between colon tumor
growth and apoptosis regulatory proteins as well as the
DNA binding activity of NF-κB, we performed Western
blotting and EMSA experiments. We found the expression
of DR4, DR5, cleaved caspase-3, cleaved caspase-8
and Bax was increased, but the expression of Bcl-2 was
decreased (Figure 10A). We also found the DNA binding
activity of NF-κB was decreased in BV-treated colon
tumor tissues (Figure 10B).

the clear mechanism has not been found yet. The possible
molecular targets of BV and its component for inhibition
of cancer cell growth are numerous and various [34]. Our
previous study showed that BV and its major component
melittin inhibited cancer cell growth in prostate carcinoma
cells through induction of apoptotic cell death in vitro as
well as in vivo xenograft model via activation of caspase
pathway through suppression of constituted activation of
NF-κB activity [32], BV and melittin induced apoptotic
cell death in ovarian cancer cells through enhancement of
DR3, DR4 and DR6 expression and inhibition of STAT3
pathway [33], BV inhibited cancer cell growth in NSCLC
cells through the induction of apoptosis via increase of
DR3 expression and inhibition of NF-κB pathway [35].
Similarly, we found that BV inhibited the growth of
colon cancer cells through activation of DR4 and DR5

and inhibition of NF-κB pathway. These data suggest that
differential signals are involved in the inhibitory effect of
BV on cancer cell growth depending on cancer cell types.
It was reported that cancer cell growth inhibitory
effect was correlated with the down-regulation of various
cell proliferative genes regulated by NF-κB [36]. In
agreement with this notion, we found that BV suppressed
DNA binding activity of NF-κB. Moreover, the decrease
of NF-κB DNA binding activity was associated with the
inhibitory effect of BV on the IκB phosphorylation and
nuclear translocation of p50 and p65 in colon cancer
cells. The present data showed that BV also suppressed
the expression of anti-apoptotic proteins like Bcl-2, while
it increased the expression of pro-apoptotic proteins such
as Bax, caspase-3, caspase-8 and caspase-9 which are
regulated by NF-κB. Thus, BV may induce an alteration

of expression of apoptosis and anti-apoptosis regulatory
proteins to provide a favorable circumstance for the cancer
cells to reach death status by down-regulation of NF-κB.
Enhanced cell growth inhibition was found to occur with
the combination treatment with NF-κB inhibitor PAO
(phenylarsine oxide, 0.1 μM) or p50 siRNA trasfection
and BV. It may be because BV binds to p50, and prevents
its translocation to nucleus. P50 siRNA may work in
other step (may inhibit its expression). Two different
mechanisms could work synergistically or additively.
These data suggest that inhibition of NF-κB contributed
to the BV-induced inhibitory effect of colon cancer cell
growth. Therefore, it is possible that reduced NF-κB
activity may be correlated with the inhibition of colon
cancer cell growth by BV treatment.

Recent studies on the signaling mechanisms of
the DRs have revealed that members of the NF-κB
and caspase families are key regulators of cell death.
Expression of DRs leads to activation of caspase-8, which
induces activation of effecter caspase like caspase-3 that
can active caspase-9 to cause apoptotic cell death [37, 38].
NF-κB is also involved in growth arrest and/or apoptosis
by regulating the expression of various target genes
such as Cyclin D1, Bax, caspase-3, caspase-9, Bcl-2,
IAP and survivin [39, 40]. These results may suggest
that the inhibition of NF-κB correlates with the increased
expression of DRs. Numerous studies have demonstrated
that natural compounds-induced apoptosis in cancer
cells may be correlated to the increase of DR expression.

derived from dried rind of the fruit Garcinia indica can
potentiate TRAIL-induced apoptotic cell death of human
colon cancer cell through up-regulation of DR4 and DR5
[16]. Quercetin also enhanced TRAIL-mediated apoptosis
in colon cancer cells by inducing the accumulation of
death receptors in lipid rafts [17]. Zerumbone enhanced
TRAIL-induced apoptosis through the induction of
death receptors in human colon cancer cells [18]. In our
previous study, we demonstrated that the snake venom
toxin from Vipera lebetina turanica induces apoptosis of
colon cancer cells through reactive oxygen species (ROS)
and c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK) dependent death
receptor (DR4 and DR5) expression [15], and (E)-2,4Bis(p-hydroxyphenyl)-2-butenal inhibits colon cancer cell
growth via suppression of NF-κB and induction of DR6
[41]. Similarly, our results showed that the expression of
DR4 and DR5 was increased in both HCT116 and SW480
colon cancer cells. We also observed that BV induced

the increasing expression of DR downstream apoptotic
proteins such as cleaved caspase-3, cleaved caspase-8,
cleaved caspase-9 and Bax but decreased expression of
Bcl-2 in colon cancer cells. Transcriptional regulation of
DR4 and DR5 is complex, and multiple potential binding
sites of various transcription factors, including p53, are
present in the upstream region of DR4 and DR5 [42].
Our data showed that the increasing expression of p53
and p21 are both induced by BV. Thus, the induction of
DR4 and DR5 by BV treatment may be dependent on
p53 in HCT116 and SW480 colon cancer cells. Besides,
co-treatment with BV and p53 siRNA or pifithrin-α,
a p53 inhibitor partially abolished BV-induced cell
growth inhibition and activation of DR4 and DR5. These
data suggest that BV-induced apoptotic cell death and
inhibitory effect of cancer cell growth might be correlated
with the activation of p53 dependent DR4 and DR5
expression.

Docking model and pull-down assay showed that
melittin, the major component of BV, directly bound
with NF-κB p50 subunit to inhibit the DNA binding
activity of NF-κB. Melittin bound to the nuclear
localization sequence (NLS: Tyr387, Val388, Pro390,
Lys392, Thr424, Pro427, Lys 428, Thr522, Ser524 and
Phe525), which was near to the C-terminus of p50. The
binding site of p50 to melittin was not as the same as our
previous finding which showed that melittin bound to the
DNA binding site of p50 [20]. However, it is noteworthy
that blocking NLS is important for the translocation of
p50 to nucleus inhibiting NF-κB activity [43]. Importin
α3 is shown to directly bind to NLS of NF-κB p50 and
p65 proteins, and IκBα inhibits nuclear translocation of

NF-κB by inhibiting the binding of p65 homodimers and
p50/p65 heterodimers to importin α3 [44]. The inducible
nuclear translocation of NF-κB in Jukat T lymphocytes
is significantly inhibited by a cell-permeable3 peptide
which could bind to the NLS of the NF-κB p50 subunit
[45]. Therefore, the present data indicated that BV
effectively inhibited colon cancer cell growth through
inactivation of NF-κB by directly binding with p50
NF-κB subunit. Taken together, our results provide
the mechanistic evidence that BV treatment results in
induction of apoptosis of colon cancer cells through upregulation of DR4 and DR5 as well as suppression of
NF-κB. Therefore, our results suggest that BV could be
applicable as an anti-colon cancer agent.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

FBS,100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin.
FHC was cultured in DMEM: F12 (1:1) medium (ATCC)
supplemented with 10% heat inactivated FBS, 25 mM
HEPES, 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin.
Cell cultures were then maintained in an incubator within a
humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37°C.

Materials
Dried BV was purchased from You-Miel Bee Venom
Ltd. (Hwasoon, Jeonnam, Korea). The composition of
the BV was as previously described [26]. Caspase-3,
caspase-8, caspase-9 antibodies were purchased from Cell
Signaling Technology Inc. (Beverly, MA). DR3, DR4,
DR5, Fas, TRAIL, IκBα, phospho-IκBα, p50, p65, p21,
p53, Bcl-2, Bax, Histone-H1 and β-actin antibodies were
purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa
Cruz, CA). The cell culture materials were obtained from
Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA), and other chemical reagents
were from Sigma Chemical Co.

Cell viability assay
Colon cancer cells HCT116 and SW480 were plated
in 96-well plates for 24 h, and then were treated with BV
(0–10 μg/ml) for 24 h. After treatment, cell viability was
measured by MTT [3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5Diphenyltetrazolium Bromide] assay (Sigma Aldrich, St.
Louis, MO) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Briefly, MTT (5 mg/ml) was added and plates were
incubated at 37°C for 4 h before dimethyl sulfoxide (100 μl)
was added to each well. Finally, the absorbance of each well
was read at a wavelength of 540 nm using a plate reader.

Cell culture
The HCT116 and SW480 colon cancer cell lines
and FHC colon epithelial normal cells were obtained from
American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). HCT116 was
cultured in DMEM (Gibco, Life Technologies, Grand Island,
NY) medium supplemented with 10% heat inactivated fetal
bovine serum (FBS) and 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml
streptomycin (Invitrogen). SW480 was cultured in RPMI
1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat inactivated
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Apoptosis evaluation
Colon cancer cells HCT116 and SW480 were cultured
on 8-chamber slides. The cells were treated with BV (0–5 μg/
ml) for 24 h, and then washed twice with phosphate buffered
saline (PBS) and fixed by incubation in 4% paraformaldehyde
44448

Oncotarget

in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. TdT-mediated dUTP
nick and labeling TUNEL assays were performed by using
the DeadEnd™ Fluorometric TUNEL System (Promega
Corporation, Madison, USA) according to manufacturer’s
instructions. Total number of cells in a given area was
determined by using DAPI staining. The apoptotic index was
determined as the number of TUNEL-positive stained cells
divided by the total cell number counted × 100%.

Pull-down assay

Soft agar colony formation assay

Docking studies between NF-κB p50 and melittin
were performed using Autodock VINA [28] as described
elsewhere [27].

Pull-down assay was performed as described elsewhere
[27]. The proteins were then resolved by SDS-PAGE followed
by immunoblotting with antibodies against p50 (1:1000
dilutions, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA).

Docking experiment

Effect of BV on colony formation ability of the
HCT116 and SW480 cells were assessed by soft agar colony
formation assay. The assay was done in 6-well plates. In each
well, 2 ml of 0.6% agar (in culture medium) was layered
in the bottom followed by 3 ml of 0.3% agar as the top
layer. Approximately 8 × 103 cells were the plated over the
top layer. The cells were treated with BV (0–5 μg/ml) and
maintained at 37°C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere for
10 days. Then the colonies were counted under a microscope.

Antitumor activity study in in vivo xenograft
animal model
Eight-week-old male BALB/C nude mice were
purchased from Orient-Bio (Gyunggi-do, Korea). The
mice were maintained in accordance with the Korea
Food and Drug Administration guidelines as well as the
regulations for the care and use of laboratory animals
of the animal ethics committee of Chungbuk National
University (CBNU-278-11-01). The mice were held
for 4 days after arriving before they were injected with
cells. The last injection of BV was at the 18th day, and
after 3 days the mice were euthanized at the 21th day.
The mice were fed with mouse diet (S-11102 Altromin
Moused Diet 1314 IRR) purchased from Samtako Inc.
during the study. Human colon cancer cell line HCT116
cells were injected subcutaneous (1 × 107 tumor cells/0.1
ml PBS/animals) with a 27-gauge needle into the right
lower flanks in carrier mice. After 14 days, when the
tumors had reached an average volume of 100–150 mm3,
the tumor-bearing nude mice were intraperitoneally (i.p.)
injected with BV (1 mg/kg dissolved in PBS) twice per
week for 3 weeks. The group untreated was designed as
the control. The weight and tumor volume of the animals
were monitored twice per week. The tumor volumes
were measured with vernier calipers and calculated by
the following formula: (A × B2)/2, where A is the larger
and B is the smaller of the two dimensions. At the end of
the experiment, the animals were sacrificed. The tumors
were separated from the surrounding muscles and dermis,
excised and weighed.

Western blot assay
Western blot assays were performed as previously
described [26]. After a short washing in TBST, the
membranes were immunoblotted with the following
primary antibodies: caspase-3, caspase-8, caspase-9
(1:1000 dilutions; Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA) and
p53, p21, DR3, DR4, DR5, Fas, TRAIL, Bax and Bcl-2
(1:1000 dilutions; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz,
CA). The blots were performed using specific antibodies
followed by second antibodies and visualization by
chemiluminescence (ECL) detection system.

Electrophoretic mobility shift assay and
supershift assay
The DNA binding activity of NF-κB was
determined using an electrophoretic mobility shift assay
(EMSA) performed as according to the manufacturer’s
recommendations (Promega). Supershift assay was
performed on HCT116 cells, and a small volume of
p50 antibody (1 μl) was added to the binding mix, and
incubated at 37°C for 30 min before loading. The relative
densities of the DNA–protein binding bands were scanned
by densitometry using MyImage (SLB), and quantified by
Labworks 4.0 software (UVP, Inc., Upland, CA).

Immunohistochemistry
The animal tissues were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde
and cut into 5 μm sections using a freezing microtome
(Thermo Scientific, Germany). The sections were stained
with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) for pathological
examination. For immunohistological staining, tumor
sections were incubated with primary antibody against
PCNA, DR4, DR5, active caspase-3 and p50 (1:500, Abcam,
Cambridge, UK). Immunohistochemistry experiment was
performed as previously described [26].

Transfection of siRNA
2 × 105 cells were plated in 6-well plates and were
transiently transfected with siRNA, using a mixture of
siRNA and the WellFect-EX PLUS reagent in OPTIMEM, according to the manufacturer’s specification
(WelGENE, Seoul, Korea). The transfected cells were
treated with BV (2 or 5 μg/ml) for 24 h and then used for
detecting cell viability and protein expression.
