ABSTRACT
The heparan sulfate mimetic PG545 has been shown to exert anti-angiogenic
and anti-metastatic activity in vitro and in vivo cancer models. Although much of
this activity has been attributed to inhibition of heparanase and heparan sulfatebinding growth factors, it was hypothesized that PG545 may additionally disrupt
Wnt signaling, an important pathway underlying the malignancy of pancreatic
cancer. We show that PG545, by directly interacting with Wnt3a and Wnt7a, inhibits
Wnt/β-catenin signaling leading to inhibition of proliferation in pancreatic tumor
cell lines. Additionally, we demonstrate for the first time that the combination of
PG545 with gemcitabine has strong synergistic effects on viability, motility and
apoptosis induction in several pancreatic cell lines. In an orthotopic xenograft mouse
model, combination of PG545 with gemcitabine efficiently inhibited tumor growth
and metastasis compared to single treatment alone. Also, PG545 treatment alone
decreased the levels of β-catenin and its downstream targets, cyclin D1, MMP-7 and
VEGF which is consistent with our in vitro data. Collectively, our findings suggest
that PG545 exerts anti-tumor activity by disrupting Wnt/β-catenin signaling and
combination with gemcitabine should be considered as a novel therapeutic strategy
for pancreatic cancer treatment.

INTRODUCTION

of patients with PDAC, is not very effective in reducing
the metastatic potential of these tumors [3] leading to the
suggestion that a combination of gemcitabine with targeted
agents may be more effective in combating metastasis of
PDAC. Of all the signaling pathways altered in PDAC, the
Wnt/β-catenin canonical pathway is considered to play a
critical role in promoting angiogenesis, tumor progression,
dysregulation of cell cycle and apoptosis, carcinogenesis

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) the most
common tumor of the pancreas, is an aggressive cancer
that is highly proliferative, chemoresistant, angiogenic and
antiapoptotic with a dismal 5 year survival rate of less than
5% [1, 2]. Monotherapy with gemcitabine, a deoxycytidine
nucleoside analog which is currently used in the treatment

[4-6] and metastasis in pancreatic cancer [7]. Wnt3a is
considered a major initiating factor in the Wnt/β-catenin
canonical pathway [8] and Wnt7a has been shown to be
highly expressed in pancreatic cancer cell lines [9]. Thus,
a novel therapy targeting Wnt signaling with combination
of gemcitabine can be considered as a potent therapeutic
strategy to improve the overall survival of patients with
PDAC.
Heparanase, an endo-β-D-glucuronidase, is involved
with tumor angiogenesis and metastasis via the regulation
of heparan sulfate (HS) cleavage in several cancers [10,
11]. A new heparanase inhibitor/HS mimetic, PG545,
suppressed tumor growth and metastasis in various
solid tumors and metastasis models [12-14] and also
dramatically increased the overall survival in a syngeneic
4T1 breast cancer model which was associated with
down regulation of heparanase in primary tumor and lung
metastases [15]. This compound also acts by inhibiting
the binding of growth factors such as FGF-2 and VEGF

to HS leading to reduced signaling through their cognate
receptors [12]. Though all of these reports attest to the
anti-angiogenic, anti-tumor and/or anti-metastatic activity
of PG545, the focus of these studies tended to be just on
the changes observed within the tumor microenvironment
(including host cells) rather than on specific molecular
switches or signaling pathways within the actual tumor
cells. Thus, in the present study, the molecular mechanism
of PG545 alone or its combination with gemcitabine was
investigated in association with Wnt/β-catenin signaling in
various pancreatic cells in vitro and in vivo.

RESULTS

Conversely the suppression of β-catenin and Cyclin D1
level by PG545 was rescued by Wnt3a at 50 ng/ml (Fig.
S1B). We found that PG545 consistently attenuated the
expression of Cyclin D1, MMP-7, VEGF and c-Myc by
RT-qPCR (Fig. 1C) and the transcriptional activity of
β-catenin by luciferase assay in AsPC-1 cells (Fig. 1D)
[16]. In addition, PG545 also suppressed the proliferation
of AsPC-1 and Panc-1 cells in a concentration-dependent
manner (Fig. S1C).

PG545 suppresses Wnt/β-catenin signaling in
pancreatic cancer cells
PG545 dramatically decreased the levels of
β-catenin, phosphorylation of GSK3α/β and its
downstream target, Cyclin D1 in all tested pancreatic
cancer cells (AsPC-1, MiaPaCa-2, and Capan-1) in a
concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 1A and S1A). In
order to determine if the decreased β-catenin resulted
from blockade of the canonical Wnt pathway, the effect
of PG545 was assessed in the presence of the ligand
Wnt3a. PG545 reduced the Wnt3a-induced increase
of β-catenin and Cyclin D1 in AsPC-1 cells (Fig. 1B).

PG545 blocks Wnt binding to cell surface
To determine whether PG545 mediated down
regulation of Wnt/β-catenin was dependent on
proteosomal degradation, we treated the cells with
5µM proteasome inhibitor MG132. MG132 treatment

rescued the down regulation of β-catenin by PG545 in
Wnt3a treated AsPC-1 cells (Fig. S2A), indicating that
proteasomal degradation, not transcriptional regulation,
is responsible for modulating β-catenin levels. Since
Wnt binds to the heparan sulfate moieties on HSPGs, we
hypothesized that the highly sulfated HS mimetic PG545
would compete with HSPGs for Wnt [17, 18]. Therefore,
we examined the interaction between Wnt3a or Wnt7a and
PG545 using heparin-binding functional assays for these
proteins. Here, PG545 potently inhibited the interaction
of immobilized heparin to both Wnt proteins with IC50
values of 1.91 ± 0.09 nM for Wnt3a and 0.97 ± 0.12 nM
for Wnt7a (Fig. 2A). Next, we evaluated the capacity of
PG545 to inhibit the cell surface-binding ability of Wnts.
Immunofluorescence analysis showed that the interaction
between Wnt3a and Wnt7a and the surface of AsPC-1
cells was abrogated by PG545 (Fig. 2B). Furthermore,

FACS analysis revealed that PG545 blocked the Wnt-cell
surface interaction in AsPC-1 and Capan-1 cells (Fig. 2C).
Consistently, the binding of Wnt7a at the cell surface was
reduced in a concentration dependent fashion by PG545
(Fig. S2C). We confirmed that PG545 attenuated the
β-catenin transcriptional activity induced by Wnt3a (Fig.
2D). Taken together, these data suggest that PG545 blocks
the HSPG-dependent interaction of Wnt proteins to the
cell surface by directly binding to the Wnt HS-binding
site.

PG545 promotes apoptosis in pancreatic cancer
cells via inhibition of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling
Due to the importance of gemcitabine in treatment
of pancreatic cancer, we compared the potency of PG545

Figure 3: Effects of PG545 and gemcitabine treatment on pancreatic cancer cells. (A) AsPC-1, BxPC-3, MiaPaCa-2, and

Panc-1 cells were treated with various concentrations of gemcitabine (0.05 to 0.6 μM) for 72 h or PG545 (5 to 100 μM) for 24 h. Cell
viability was measured by MTT assay. (B) AsPC-1 and Panc-1 cells were treated with PBS (control), gemcitabine (50 ng/ml) or PG545 (40

the percentage of apoptotic cells, i.e. positive staining for both Annexin V and PI. (C) The cells treated with PG545 (20 μM) for 6 h were

against four pancreatic cell lines and compared this to
gemcitabine. Based on cell viability data, Panc-1 was
considered less susceptible to gemcitabine compared with
AsPC-1, MiaPaCa-2 and BxPC-3 (Fig. 3A). PG545 was
effective against all four pancreatic cancer cells tested,
including Panc-1, with IC50 values ranging from 51 to
70 µΜ. Similarly, flow cytometric analysis revealed that
PG545 dramatically increased the Annexin V-PI double
stained apoptotic population to 36.1% in Panc-1 cells
compared to untreated control (7.3%), while gemcitabineinduced apoptosis only in AsPC-1, but not in Panc-1
or AsPC-1 cells previously cultured to become less
susceptible to gemcitabine (termed gemcitabine resistant
or GR cells) (Fig. 3B and Fig. S3). Next, we evaluated the
anti-tumor effect of PG545 on Wnt/β-catenin signaling in

Panc-1. PG545 reduced the levels of β-catenin in Panc-1,
similar to the response seen in MiaPaCa-2 and Capan-1
cells (Fig. S1A), albeit to a lesser extent compared to
AsPC-1 (Fig. 3C). Additionally, we found that PG545
completely blocked the binding of Wnt3a or Wnt7a to
the surface of Panc-1 cells (Fig. 3D, S2B and Fig. S2D),
similar to what was observed for AsPC-1 and Capan-1
cells (Fig. 2B and C). These data suggest that inhibiting
the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway should be considered
a new mechanism of action for PG545 in pancreatic
cancer.

PG545 exerts synergistic effects with gemcitabine
in pancreatic tumor cells

significantly less than single agent, gemcitabine at day
28 (Fig. 5A and B). At necropsy, the measured tumor
weight and size of mice in each group showed that the
combination treatment was more effective at reducing
cancer progression compared to all of the other groups
(Fig. 5C and Fig. S8B). To further evaluate tumor
progression, we counted the number of metastatic lesions
in the lung. The combination group showed a dramatically
decreased number of lung metastasis compared to PG545
or gemcitabine alone treated group (Fig. 5D, E and
Fig. S8C). Consistent with these morphological data,
immunohistochemistry revealed the decreased expression
of the cell proliferation marker PCNA and increased levels
of apoptotic marker cleaved-Caspase 3 in the combination
treatment group compared to single treatment groups and
control (Fig. 5F). These data demonstrate that PG545gemcitabine combination treatment leads to significantly
enhanced antitumor activity in a mouse model of PDAC.
There was no significant body weight loss in PG545 or
combination treated group compared to control group (Fig.
S8A).

Because single agent gemcitabine treatment of
pancreatic cancer has not greatly improved patient
prognosis [3], considerable research has been conducted to
find treatments that work more effectively in combination
with this agent. We combined gemcitabine with PG545 to
determine if, together, they provide synergistic benefits.
The combination treatment of PG545 and gemcitabine
showed greater potency than gemcitabine alone in
reducing viability of all the pancreatic cancer cell lines,
AsPC-1, MiaPaCa-2, BxPC-3 and Panc-1 cells (Fig.
4A). Significantly, the combination index (CI) values
below 0.5 indicated that the combination treatment
showed strong synergy in all four tested cells (Fig. 4B).
CI values of <1 indicate synergistic, =1 additive and >1
antagonistic behavior. Evidence of a synergistic effect
of PG545 treatment with gemcitabine was also shown in
gemcitabine-resistant cells (Fig. S3 and S4), leading to
dramatic decreases in the viability and enhanced apoptosis
of these cells, compared with parental cells or gemcitabine
alone (Fig. S3 and S4A). Given CI values were under 1
across most fractions affected (Fa) (Fig. S4B), systematic
assessment of the potential for PG545 to overcome
gemcitabine resistance in vivo is warranted but considered
beyond the scope of the current studies.
Wound healing assays demonstrated that
combination treatment either with half the dose or the
same concentration used for single treatment was more
effective in inhibiting the motility of AsPC-1 cells than
PG545 or gemcitabine alone (Fig. S5). Furthermore,
flow cytometric analysis showed combination treatment
with half the concentrations of the drugs used for single
treatment increased the Annexin V-PI double stained
apoptotic population compared to PG545 or gemcitabine
alone (Fig.4C). Consistently, immunoblot analysis showed
combination treatment enhanced the levels of the proapoptotic markers, cleaved PARP and activated Caspase-9
compared to single treatment alone (Fig. 4D). Conversely,
PG545 showed no activation of the alternative apoptotic
Caspase 8 pathway, although gemcitabine alone did elicit
a response (Fig. S6).

PG545 suppresses the Wnt/β-catenin signaling in
pancreatic tumor xenografts
Tumor samples from the xenograft study presented
in Figure 5 were further analyzed to examine the
biochemical mechanism underlying the anti-tumor
activity of PG545. IHC analysis of xenografts showed
that the expression of VEGF, MMP-7, Cyclin D1 and
β-catenin was significantly decreased in PG545 treated
group compared to untreated control (Fig. 6A). In contrast,
staining for VEGFR2, a major receptor involved in
mediating VEGF signaling, showed no differences across
the 4 treatment groups (Fig. S9). Consistent with the IHC
data, immunoblotting showed that β-catenin and cyclin D1
levels were decreased by70% and 45%, respectively in the
PG545 treated group compared to the untreated control
group (Fig. 6B, C and D), which is also consistent with
our in vitro immunoblotting and RT-qPCR results (Fig. 1).

DISCUSSION
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) occurs,
in the majority of cases, with early locoregional spread and
distant metastasis at diagnosis, leading to dismal prognosis
and limited treatment options. Standard chemotherapy,
typically with gemcitabine, provides only modest benefit
to patients [19] and thus novel pathways for intervention
are being investigated. The Wnt ligands are secreted
glycoproteins that have critical roles in a variety of cellular
processes, including survival, differentiation, migration
and proliferation through regulation of β-catenin stability
[16, 20]. Recently, aberrant levels of β-catenin have been
detected in pancreatic cancer [21] and it is now apparent

PG545 and gemcitabine combination suppresses
tumor growth and metastasis in orthotopic model
The effect of PG545-gemcitabine combination on
primary tumor growth and metastasis was evaluated in
orthotopic AsPC-1 bearing nude mice. Tumor growth of
four groups was measured once a week for four weeks
using in vivo image analyzers as described in the methods
section (Fig. S7). Tumor volume in mice treated with
combination of PG545 and gemcitabine was reduced by
4-fold compared to the vehicle injected group and was

that ligand-mediated activation of the Wnt/β-catenin
pathway is required for the initiation of pancreatic cancer
and Wnt signaling is critical for progression of the disease
[6].
As the enzyme primarily responsible for the
degradation of HS chains, heparanase has been shown to
modify tumor cell responses to HS-binding of Wnt3a such
as effects on cell proliferation and adhesion, in addition
to its HS-chain degrading activity [22]. Given the high
affinity binding of Wnt ligands to HS [23] and the link
between altered HSPGs, heparanase, and tumor cell

metastasis [24-26], investigating HS mimetics/heparanase
inhibitors effect on Wnt signaling was considered a
novel approach to discover new therapeutic options for
pancreatic carcinomas. A HS mimetic M402 currently
in Phase I/II trials in pancreatic cancer was designed to
inhibit tumor-host interactions including VEGF, FGF2,
SDF-1 and heparanase [27]. However, to the best of
our knowledge, the ability of HS mimetics/heparanase
inhibitors to bind and modulate the Wnt signaling
pathway has not been investigated. Here, we identify a
new role for PG545 in the blockade of Wnt signaling

Figure 6: PG545 inhibits β-catenin signaling in AsPC-1 orthotopic xenograft mouse model. (A) Immunohistochemical

and demonstrate for the first time that a HS mimetic can
repress this significant tumor-promoting pathway. PG545
interacts with Wnt3a and Wnt7a to preventing them from
binding to their receptors, LRP5/6 and Frizzled (Fig. 2),
resulting in significantly decreased β-catenin levels (Fig.
1), suppressed tumor growth and metastasis in pancreatic
tumors (Fig. 5).
A recent study by Ostapoff and colleagues
demonstrated that PG545 suppresses the proliferation,
migration and colony formation of pancreatic ductal
adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cells [14]. Moreover, the same
group showed PG545 treatment of a mPDAC genetic
model also led to a change in the localization of β-catenin
within tumor cells - in the untreated controls, β-catenin
was associated with the nucleus but in the PG545 treated
tumors, it was associated with the membrane and in the
cytoplasm. This is broadly consistent with the notion that
PG545 blocks Wnt/β-catenin signaling, thus preventing
β-catenin from entering the nucleus in significant
quantities. In the present study, we show equally profound,
but slightly divergent, effects on the levels and localization
of β-catenin within AsPC-1 xenograft tumor cells treated
with PG545 (Fig. 6). The untreated controls show
higher β-catenin levels throughout the cells compared
to the PG545 treated tumors indicating that inhibition of
Wnt-receptor binding led to a systemic reduction in the
amount of β-catenin. The results of PG545 inhibition of
this systemic suppression of β-catenin can be seen in the
reduced levels of proteins whose expression is driven by
β-catenin including Cyclin D1, MMP-7 and VEGF (Fig.
6) and in the induction of apoptosis (Fig. 3 and 4). The
induction of cleavage of the apoptotic proteins caspase
3, caspase 9 and PARP has been linked to blockade of
Wnt/β-catenin signaling and provides further evidence that
promotion of apoptosis by PG545 was being driven by
Wnt inhibition [28-31]. The contrasting effects of PG545
on β-catenin in our AsPC-1 xenograft model compared
to the mPDAC genetic model described by Ostapoff and
colleagues may suggest differences in β-catenin regulation
between human and mouse pancreatic tumors.
Given the low survival rates in PDAC, significant
efforts are underway to seek agents to combine with
gemcitabine. Based on our data, PG545 combined with
gemcitabine led to a synergistic inhibitory effect on
cancer cell survival and motility (Fig. S5), induction
of apoptosis (Fig. 3B, 4C and D), enhanced antitumor
activity (Fig. 5A, B, C) and anti-metastatic activity
(Fig. 5E) versus either agent alone and could possibly
overcome gemcitabine resistance as evidenced by in
vitro data (Fig. 4A, B, S3 and S4). However, the potential
utility of this combination in the clinic would firstly
focus on improving the overall response rate/blockade of
metastatic spread in those patients receiving gemcitabine
as standard-of-care. Patients who subsequently become
resistant to gemcitabine would have treatment withdrawn
to facilitate second-line treatment options. Therefore,
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

consistent with the data herein the objective of an initial
clinical investigation of PG545 and gemcitabine would be
to enhance the overall response in patients most likely to
respond to gemcitabine.
PG545 is a clinically relevant HS mimetic
(clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT02042781) which, in
addition to possessing anti-angiogenic properties, also
acts as a heparanase inhibitor which may differentiate
its mechanism(s) of action from approved angiogenesis
inhibitors [13, 15]. Herein, we report that further to the
previously published findings on PG545’s ability to
interfere with angiogenic growth factors, this compound
also inhibits Wnt signaling within tumor cells which
leads to reduced levels of β-catenin, VEGF, MMP-7 and
Cyclin D1 (Fig 6). Based on these data, the inhibition
of Wnt signaling by PG545 represents a novel effect on
the tumor rather than the host cell, and thus may explain
the synergistic effects on proliferation, motility and
apoptosis in pancreatic cancer cell lines in vitro and an
enhanced antitumor response in vivo, when administered
in combination with gemcitabine. An alternative, or
perhaps complementary, explanation for the observed
synergy is that PG545 and gemcitabine target different
pro-tumor pathways, thus eliminating the redundancy that
allows tumor cells to adapt to treatment and continue to
proliferate and spread. These findings highlight the need
to better understand the recently described interaction
between Wnt signaling and heparanase in cancer biology
[22].
In summary, we clearly demonstrate that PG545
directly binds with Wnts leading to a blockade of ligandreceptor binding (Fig. S10). This inhibitory effect on
β-catenin stability resulted in suppression of tumor growth
and metastasis and induction of apoptosis in PDACs.
Furthermore, co-treatment of PG545 and gemcitabine
showed the synergistic antitumor activity in PDACs
compared to single agent treatment. Overall, these findings
suggest that combination of PG545 and gemcitabine can
be a potent therapeutic strategy for pancreatic cancer
treatment.

human Wnt3a and Wnt7a proteins were purchased from
R&D Systems (USA). PG545 was provided by Progen
Pharmaceuticals (Australia) and gemcitabine was from
Sigma Chemical (USA). The recombinant His-tagged
Wnt3a and Wnt7a proteins were from Proteintech Group
(USA).

Apoptosis of the PG545 and/or gemcitabine-treated
cells was determined as previously described [32]. Cells
were quantitated by double staining with Annexin V-FITC
and propidium iodide (PI) using the Annexin V-Apoptosis
Detection kit (Biovision, USA). Apoptotic cells were
analyzed by FACSCalibur (Becton Dickinson, USA)
to define as those positive cells for Annexin V with or
without PI staining.

Cytotoxicity assay
To evaluate the synergistic effect of PG545 and
gemcitabine on cell viability, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay was
performed. Briefly, four pancreatic cancer cells such as
AsPC-1, MiaPaCa-2, Panc-1 and BxPC-3 cells (1×104
cells/well) were seeded onto 96-well culture plate
and exposed to various concentrations of PG545 and/
or gemcitabine. The viability of cells was analyzed as
previously described [32].

Real-Time Quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR)
Total RNA was isolated from AsPC-1 cells with
QIAzol (Invitrogen, USA). A reverse transcription kit
(Promega, USA) was used to construct the template
cDNA. RT-qPCR was performed with the LightCycler480
instrument (Roche Applied Sciences, USA). The mRNA
level of GAPDH was used to normalize the expression of
genes of interest. The primers used are in Table S1.

Luciferase assay
Transfection was carried out with X-tremeGENE HP
DNA transfection Reagent (Roche Applied Sciences, USA)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Luciferase
assays were performed using the Dual luciferase assay kit
(Promega, USA). The TOPflash reporter plasmid kindly
gifted by Dr. Sangtaek Oh (Kookmin University, Korea).

Wnt heparin binding assay
The binding of Wnt proteins to heparin was assayed
in heparin-coated 96-well microplates using antibody
detection. All steps were performed at 22°C. Heparin was
immobilized onto DNA-Bind microplates (Corning, USA)
via an amine group introduced at the reducing end of the
heparin polymer (Supplementary Methods).

Proliferation assay
To examine the anti-proliferative effect of PG545,
Panc-1, and Capan-1 cells (1×104 cells/well) were seeded
onto 96-well cell culture plate and exposed to various
concentrations of PG545 for 24 h. Proliferation assays
were performed using a BrdU Cell Proliferation assay
kit (Roche Applied Sciences, USA) according to the
manufacturer’s protocol.

Immunofluorescence assay
Cells treated with recombinant human His-Wnt3a or
Wnt7a protein in the presence or absence of PG545 were
fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, blocked in 0.1% Triton
X-100, 5% BSA in PBS for 30min at 4°C and incubated
with FITC-conjugated anti-His tag (Ab Chem, USA)
overnight at 4°C. Immunostained cells were mounted
with mounting medium containing DAPI (1.5 μg/mL)
(Vectashield, USA) and visualized by using Olympus
FLUOVIEW FV10i confocal microscope.

Western blotting
Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (50mM TrisHCl, 150mM NaCl, 2mM EDTA, and 1% TritonX-100)
containing protease inhibitors (Roche, Germany), and
phosphatase inhibitors (Sigma, USA). The protein samples
were separated on 8 to 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels,
and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes
were incubated with primary antibodies diluted in 3%
BSA in PBS-Tween20 (1:500-1:2000) overnight at 4°C,
washed three times with PBS-Tween20, and incubated
with HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies. Expression
was visualized by using ECL Western blotting detection
reagent (GE Healthcare, UK)

Wnt binding assay by FACS
Cells were treated with recombinant human His-Wnt
(100 ng/ml) with or without 10 µΜ PG545 at 4°C. HisWnt treated cells were harvested and washed with cold
PBS thrice, and then incubated with FITC-conjugated antiHis tag (Ab Chem, USA) for 1 h at 4°C. The antibodylabeled cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde/5%
BSA in PBS and the immunolabeled cells were analyzed
by FACSCalibur (Becton Dickinson, USA).

Synergy between PG545 and gemcitabine by
combination index

sample.

Statistical analyses

To determine the synergy of PG545 and
gemcitabine, cytotoxicity assay was performed in the
pancreatic cancer cell lines. Following the determination
of IC50 for each drug, synergy between PG545 and
gemcitabine was evaluated by the method of Chou Talalay
[33] using CalcuSyn software (Biosoft, USA) to calculate
combination index values.

All data were presented as means ± standard
deviation (SD). The statistically significant differences
between control and PG545/gemcitabine treated groups
were calculated by Student’s t-test. A one-way ANOVA
was used for comparison of multiple groups. Statistical
difference was set at p values of <0.05 between control
and PG545/gemcitabine treated groups. All experiments
were carried out at least thrice.

Animal groups and tumor monitoring using
animal imaging system

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

Female nude mice between the ages of 5 weeks
were obtained from the National Cancer Institute (USA),
Harlan Laboratories (USA). This study was approved by
and conducted in accordance with the policies set forth
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee Mayo
clinic. One week after 1x106 Luc-transfected AsPC-1
cells were injected orthotopically into the pancreas, the
mice were randomized into the following four groups (n
= 8) based on the bioluminescence measured after the first
IVIS imaging: (Group 1, Control) untreated control (PBS,
100 μL), twice-weekly by i.p. injection; (Group 2, PG545)
PG545 (20 mg/kg), twice-weekly by i.p. injection; (Group
3, Gem) gemcitabine alone (25 mg/kg), twice weekly by
i.p. injection; and (Group 4, Combination) combination of
PG545 (10 mg/kg) and gemcitabine (12.5 mg/kg), twice
weekly by i.p. injection (see Supplementary Methods
for measurement of tumor volumes). The combination
treatment employed reduced doses of PG545 and
gemcitabine to reduce the possibility of toxicity arising
when PG545 was paired with this potent cytotoxic agent.

Immunohistochemistry was performed in tumor
sections using the indirect avidin biotin-enhanced
horseradish-peroxidase method. Antigen retrieval was
performed after deparaffinization and dehydration of the
tissue sections by microwave for 10 min in 10 mM citrate
buffer (see Supplementary Methods for tumor sections).
Quantitation of staining was performed by analyzing 10
images per tumor at 20 × magnification using LAS image
analysis software (Leica). The quantification of stained
cells or area in each image is relative to the total tissue
image area and is presented as a percentage = [Number
of positive cells or area (pixel)/ total cell number or area
(pixel)] × 100.
To count lung metastases, lung tissue sections were
stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). Counting
metastatic lesions of lung tissue sections was performed
by an investigator blinded to the treatment status of the
