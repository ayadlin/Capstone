Author Manuscript

Tamoxifen (Tam) treatment is a first-line endocrine therapy for estrogen receptor α (ERα) positive
breast cancer patients. Unfortunately, resistance frequently occurs and is often related with
overexpression of the membrane tyrosine kinase receptor HER2. This is the rationale behind
combined treatments with endocrine therapy and novel inhibitors that reduce HER2 expression
and signaling and thus inhibit Tam-resistant breast cancer cell growth. In this study we show that
activation of Farnesoid X Receptor (FXR), by the primary bile acid chenodeoxycholic acid
(CDCA) or the synthetic agonist GW4064, inhibited growth of Tam-resistant breast cancer cells
(termed MCF-7 TR1), which was used as an “in vitro” model of acquired Tam-resistance. Our
results demonstrate that CDCA treatment significantly reduced both anchorage-dependent and
anchorage–independent epidermal growth factor (EGF)-induced growth in MCF-7 TR1 cells.
Furthermore, results from Western blot analysis and real-time RT-PCR revealed that CDCA
treatment reduced HER2 expression and inhibited EGF-mediated HER2 and p42/44 MAPK
phosphorylation in these Tam-resistant breast cancer cells. Transient transfection experiments,
using a vector containing the human HER2 promoter region, showed that CDCA treatment downregulated basal HER2 promoter activity. This occurred through an inhibition of NF-κB
transcription factor binding to its specific responsive element located in the HER2 promoter region
as revealed by mutagenesis studies, electrophoretic mobility shift assay and chromatin
immunoprecipitation analysis.
Collectively, these data suggest that FXR ligand-dependent activity, blocking HER2/MAPK
signaling, may overcome antiestrogen resistance in human breast cancer cells, and could represent
a new therapeutic tool to treat breast cancer patients that develop resistance.

Introduction
Administration of the selective estrogen receptor modulator Tamoxifen (Tam), to block ERα
activity, is still a first-line endocrine therapy for the management of all stages of ERαpositive breast cancer patients (Fisher et al., 1998; Gradishar, 2004). Unfortunately, not all
patients who have ERα-positive tumors respond to Tam (de novo resistance), and a large
number of patients who do respond will eventually develop disease progression or
recurrence while on therapy (acquired resistance), limiting the efficacy of the treatment.

Author Manuscript

Multiple mechanisms are responsible for the development of endocrine resistance. Among
these are the loss of ERα expression or function (Encarnacion et al., 1993), alterations in the
balance of regulatory cofactors, increased oncogenic kinase signaling (Blume-Jensen and
Hunter, 2001), and altered expression of growth factor signaling pathways (Arpino et al.,
2004; Schiff et al., 2004; Sabnis et al., 2005; Staka et al., 2005). For instance, a number of
preclinical and clinical studies suggest that both de novo and acquired resistance to Tam in
breast cancer cells can be associated with elevated levels of the membrane tyrosine kinase
HER2 (c-ErbB2, Her2/neu) (Chung et al., 2002; Meng et al., 2004; Shou et al., 2004;
Gutierrez et al., 2005).

Author Manuscript

The HER2 gene codes for a 185 kDa receptor, a member of the EGFR (HER1) family of
transmembrane tyrosine kinases, which also includes HER3 and HER4, mainly involved in
signal transduction pathways that regulate cell growth and differentiation. This receptor has
no ligand of its own, but is activated by hetero-oligomerization with other ligand-activated
receptors (Yarden, 2001). The HER2 gene is amplified and/or overexpressed in 20–25% of
ERα-positive breast cancers (Slamon et al., 1989), and clinical observations indicate that
tumors with high levels of HER2 have poor outcome when treated with Tam (Osborne et al.,
2003; Kirkegaard et al., 2007).

Author Manuscript

The mechanisms by which HER2 overexpression mediates Tam resistance result from an
intimate crosstalk between ERα and growth factor receptors intracellular kinase cascades,
such as Ras/MAPK signaling, that in turn can promote growth and progression in breast
cancer cells, negating the inhibitory effects of Tam on nuclear ERα activity (Arpino et al.,
2008). Overexpression of the HER2 gene is not attributed solely to amplification of the
HER2 gene copy number, but can also occur from a single-copy gene due to deregulation
events at the transcriptional level (Hurst, 2001).
Thus an analysis of new mechanisms controlling HER2/neu receptor gene expression could
be important to enhance strategies to reverse Tam resistance in breast cancer patients.
FXR, a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily of ligand-dependent transcription
factors, is mainly expressed in the liver and the gastrointestinal tract where it regulates
expression of genes involved in bile acids, cholesterol and triglyceride metabolism (Forman

et al., 1995; Makishima et al., 1999; Parks et al., 1999). Recently this receptor was also
detected in different nonenterohepatic compartments including breast cancer tissue and
breast cancer cell lines (Bishop-Bailey, 2004; Swales et al., 2006; Journe et al., 2008;
Catalano et al., 2010). For instance, FXR activation inhibits breast cancer cell proliferation
and negatively regulates aromatase activity reducing local estrogen production (Swales et
al., 2006), while other authors have reported that FXR activation stimulates MCF-7 cell
proliferation but only in steroid-free medium (Journe et al., 2008). However, the functions
of the bile acid sensor FXR in breast cancer tissue are still not completely understood, and
there are no data regarding its role in the endocrine resistant breast cancer phenotype. Thus,
we have investigated whether activated FXR may modulate the growth of human MCF-7
Tam-resistant breast cancer cells, a model which was developed to mimic “in vitro” the
occurrence of acquired Tam-resistance.

Author Manuscript

Here we demonstrate that a specific FXR ligand chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) or its
synthetic agonist GW4064 inhibited Tam-resistant breast cancer cell proliferation and EGFinduced growth, by reducing expression levels of the tyrosine kinase receptor HER2. This
occurs through an FXR-mediated inhibition of NF-κB binding on the human HER2
promoter region.

Results
FXR expression in Tam-resistant breast cancer cells

Author Manuscript

Acquired resistance to Tam has been associated with elevated levels of the membrane
tyrosine kinase HER2 (Knowlden et al., 2003; Nicholson et al., 2004; Gutierrez et al.,
2005). In agreement with these reports, we found a marked increase in the levels of total
HER2 protein content in Tam-resistant MCF-7TR1 compared to MCF-7 cells, while no
differences were seen in the expression of EGFR and ERα (Figure 1a). We therefore
evaluated anchorage-independent growth of MCF-7 and MCF-7TR1 cells after treatment
with Herceptin, a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against the extracellular domain
of HER2. Cells were plated in soft agar, treated with EGF in the presence or absence of
Herceptin and after 14 days colonies were counted (Figure 1b). Herceptin had no effect on
MCF-7 growth while significantly inhibited anchorage-independent growth of MCF-7TR1
cells in basal conditions as well as upon EGF treatment. These data confirm that the HER2
overexpression found in the MCF-7TR1 cells rendering them more sensitive to the
inhibitory effect of this selective HER2-targeted agent.

Next, we evaluated the expression of FXR in MCF-7 and MCF-7TR1 breast cancer cells.
Our results revealed the presence of FXR mRNA (as a band of 362 bp; Figure 1c, upper
panel) and protein (as a band of ~60 kDa; Figure 1c, lower panel) in both MCF-7 and
MCF-7TR1 cells. To assess the ability of FXR to be transactivated by the most effective
FXR activator CDCA, we transiently transfected cells with a FXR-responsive reporter gene
(FXRE-IR1) followed by treatment with increasing doses of CDCA. The specificity of the
system was tested by cotransfecting the cells with a dominant negative FXR (FXR-DN)
plasmid. As shown in Figure 1d, CDCA treatment induced a dose-dependent FXR activation
in both cell lines and expression of the dominant negative FXR completely abrogated the
CDCA-induced transactivation.

FXR activation inhibits Tam-resistant breast cancer cell growth

Author Manuscript

We examined, by MTT growth assays, the effects of increasing doses of CDCA and
GW4064, a synthetic FXR agonist. Treatment with both ligands reduced cell proliferation in
a dose-dependent manner in MCF-7 and in MCF-7TR1 cells, while had no effects on normal
breast epithelial cells MCF-10A (Figure 2a and b). Similar results in growth inhibition were
also obtained in another Tam-resistant breast cancer cell line termed MCF-7TR2
(Supplemental Figure 2a and b). It is worth note that the inhibitory effects exerted by
activated FXR on cell proliferation were significant at lower dose in MCF-7TR1 cells
compared to MCF-7 cells, as evidenced by IC50 values exhibited by MCF-7TR1 cells for
both ligands (Table 1). The antiproliferative effects exerted by CDCA were completely
reversed in the presence of a FXR-DN plasmid supporting the specific involvement of the
FXR (Figure 2c).

Author Manuscript

Next we tested the effects of CDCA in the presence of Tam on cell growth (Figure 2d). As
expected, with antiestrogen treatment cell viability was significantly reduced in MCF-7
cells, while MCF-7TR1 cells growth was unaffected, confirming the Tam-resistant
phenotype. Interestingly, combined treatment with CDCA and Tam reduced growth of
MCF-7TR1 cells compared to treatment with Tam alone, but showed no additive effects in
MCF-7 cells (Figure 2d). The ability of CDCA and Tam to inhibit Tam-resistant growth was
also confirmed using anchorage-independent growth assays (Figure 2e). These results
suggest that FXR activation can interfere with the cellular mechanisms by which
MCF-7TR1 cells escape antihormonal treatments.
CDCA reduces HER2 expression and signalling in MCF-7 TR1 cells

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

To understand the mechanisms associated with CDCA-mediated inhibition of Tam-resistant
growth in breast cancer cells, we evaluated the possible role of FXR ligands in modulating
HER2 expression. As shown in Figure 3a, treatment with CDCA at 25 and 50µM downregulated HER2 protein expression in both cell lines, but with higher reduction seen in
MCF-7TR1 cells. Similar results were also observed after treatment with GW4064 (data not
shown). A reduction in HER2 levels was also found upon CDCA treatment in MCF-7TR2
cells (Supplemental Figure 2c). No differences were found in EGFR expression upon CDCA
treatment (Supplemental Figure 3), confirming that activated FXR specifically target HER2
expression in breast cancer cells. In the presence of a FXR-DN expression vector the HER2
down-regulation was completely abrogated, confirming FXR involvement in CDCAinduced effects on HER2 (Figure 3b). Next, we questioned if these HER2 decreased levels
could modify the responsiveness of breast cancer cells after growth factor stimulation. Thus
we investigated the effects of short-term stimulation with EGF, in the presence of CDCA
treatment, on phosphorylation levels of HER2 and MAPK, the main downstream effectors
of the growth factor signalling pathway. EGF treatment increased phosphorylation of both
HER2 and MAPK, even though in higher extent in MCF-7TR1 cells. However, pretraetment
with CDCA reduced EGF-induced phosphorylation of HER2 in both cell lines and
drastically prevented MAPK activation in MCF-7TR1 cells (Figure 3c). In addition, data
obtained from MTT (Figure 3d upper panel) as well as soft agar (Figure 3d lower panel)
growth assays, revealed that CDCA treatment inhibited EGF-induced growth by 70% in
anchorage-dependent and 50% in anchorage-independent assays in MCF-7TR1 cells. CDCA

was less effective in MCF-7 cells. These results well correlated with the down-regulatory
effect of CDCA on EGF-induced cyclin D1 expression particularly in MCF-7TR1 cells
(Figure 3e).
Activated FXR inhibits the binding of NF-kB to HER2 promoter region
To explore if HER2 down-regulation relies on transcriptional mechanisms we evaluated,
using real-time RT-PCR, HER2 mRNA levels after treatment with CDCA for different
times. Exposure to CDCA exhibited a time-dependent reduction in HER2 mRNA levels in
both MCF-7 and MCF-7TR1 cells (Figure 4a). Also, transcriptional activity of a reporter
plasmid containing the human HER2 promoter region (pNeuLite) was significantly reduced
with CDCA treatment in both cell lines (Figure 4c and d).

Author Manuscript

The human HER2 promoter contains multiple consensus sites for several transcription
factors including Sp1, as well as AP-1 (activator protein-1) and NF-κB (nuclear factor-κB)
the well known effectors of FXR transrepression (He et al., 2006; Vavassori et al., 2009)
(Figure 4b). To indentify the region within the HER2 promoter responsible for CDCA
inhibitory effects a HER2 promoter deleted construct (−232pNeuLite) activity was tested
(Figure 4b). We observed that the responsiveness to CDCA was still maintained suggesting
that the region from −232 to +1 containing the NF-κB motif might be involved in
transrepression mechanisms exerted by activated FXR (Figure 4c and d). Thus we next
performed site directed mutagenesis on the NF-κB domain (NF-κB Mut) within the HER2
promoter (Figure 4b). Mutation of this domain abrogated CDCA effects (Figure 4c and d).
These latter results demonstrate that the integrity of NF-κB binding site is necessary for
FXR modulation of HER2 promoter activity in breast cancer cells.

The specific role of the NF-κB motif in the transcriptional regulation of HER2 by CDCA
was investigated using EMSA experiments. We observed the formation of a complex in
nuclear extracts from MCF-7 and MCF-7TR1 cells, using synthetic
oligodeoxyribonucleotides corresponding to the NF-κB motif (Figure 5a, lanes 1 and 5)
which was abrogated by incubation with 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled probe (Figure
5a, lanes 2 and 6) demonstrating the specificity of the DNA binding complex. This
inhibition was no longer observed when mutated oligodeoxyribonucleotide was used as
competitor (Figure 5a, lanes 3 and 7). Interestingly, treatment with CDCA strongly
decreased the DNA-binding protein complex compared with control samples (Figure 5a,
lanes 4 and 8). The inclusion of an anti-NF-κB antibody in the reaction immunodepleted the
specific band confirming the presence of NF-κB in the complex (Figure 5b, lanes 3 and 9).
Non specific IgG did not affect NF-κB complex formation (Figure 5b, lanes 4 and 10).
Recombinant NF-κB protein revealed a complex migrating at the same level as that of
nuclear extracts from cells (Figure 5a, lane 9; Figure 5b, lanes 5 and 11). Of note the
CDCA-induced reduction in the DNA-binding complex was no longer observed utilizing as
probe synthetic oligodeoxyribonucleotides corresponding to the AP-1 and Sp1 motifs
(Supplemental Figure 1a and b). To better define the role of FXR in the inhibition of NF-κB
binding on HER2 promoter, a competition assay using recombinant NF-κB protein and
increasing amounts of in vitro-translated FXR protein (1, 3 and 5µl) was carried out. A dose
dependent reduction in the NF-κB complex was seen (Figure 5c, lanes 1–4), suggesting that

physical interaction between these two transcription factors may inhibit the binding of NFκB to human HER2 promoter region. To further test this possibility we performed
coimmunoprecipitation studies using nuclear protein fractions from MCF-7 and MCF-7TR1
cells treated with CDCA. As shown in Figure 6a, the formation of a FXR and NF-κB
complex was detected in untreated cells, and this association was enhanced with FXR ligand
treatment.

Author Manuscript

Moreover, to confirm the involvement of NF-κB in CDCA-mediated HER2 down regulation
at the promoter level, ChIP assays were performed. Using specific antibodies against NF-κB
and RNA-polymerase II, protein-chromatin complexes were immunoprecipitated from cells
cultured with or without CDCA for 1h. The resulting precipitated DNA was then quantified
using real time PCR with primers spanning the NF-κB binding element in the HER2
promoter region. NF-κB recruitment was significantly decreased upon CDCA treatment in
both cell lines (Figure 6b). This result was well correlated with a lower association of RNApolymerase II to the HER2 regulatory region (Figure 6c).
To further confirm the transcriptional repression mediated by activated FXR, we also
evaluated the histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) association on the NF-κB responsive
sequence within the HER2 promoter. CDCA stimulation enhanced the recruitment of
HDAC3 to this NF-κB promoter site (Figure 6d).
HER2 downregulation underlies the ability of FRX ligands to inhibit breast cancer cell
growth

Author Manuscript

We evaluated the effects of CDCA on cell growth in the ERα-negative and HER2overexpressing breast cancer cells SKBR3. Treatment with CDCA inhibited SKBR3
anchorage-dependent growth in a dose dependent manner (Figure 7a), and reduced colony
growth in anchorage-independent assay (Figure 7b). Indeed, we found, after 48h of
treatment with CDCA, a marked decrease in both HER2 protein and mRNA levels (Figure
7c and d). In these cells HER2 promoter activity was similarly reduced with CDCA
treatment (Figure 7e).
Finally, we explored the ability of FXR ligands to inhibit proliferation using as additional
model Tam-resistant derivative cell line engineered to stably overexpress HER2 (MCF-7/
HER2-18). As expected Tam-resistant growth in these cells was not affected by both CDCA
and GW4064 treatments (Figure 7f). All together these results well evidence how FXRmediated down-regulation of HER2 at transcriptional level is fully responsible for inhibiting
breast cancer cell proliferation.

Discussion
In this study we show for the first time that the activated Farnesoid X Receptor downregulates HER2 expression in ERα-positive breast cancer cells resistant to Tam. This occurs
through the inhibition of NF-κB binding to its responsive element located in the human
HER2 promoter region, and results in a significant reduction of Tam-resistant growth.

The HER2/neu transmembrane kinase receptor is a signalling amplifier of the HER family
network, since activation of membrane tyrosine receptors (EGFR, HER3 and HER4) by
their respective ligands determines the formation of homodimeric and heterodimeric kinase
complexes into which this receptor is recruited as a preferred partner (Yarden, 2001).
Multiple lines of evidences suggest a role of HER2 in the pathogenesis of breast carcinoma
(Allred et al., 1992; Glockner et al., 2001), and clinical data suggest that breast tumors
expressing elevated level of HER2 show a more aggressive phenotype and worse outcome
when treated with Tam (Arpino et al., 2004; De Laurentiis et al., 2005). Thus, inhibitory
agents targeting HER2, such as the monoclonal antibody trastuzumab (Herceptin), have
been explored to improve hormonal treatment or delay emergence of endocrine resistance in
estrogen-dependent breast tumors (Johnston, 2009). However, even though an increased
response rate is obtained when trastuzumab is used in combination with chemotherapeutic
agents (Seidman et al., 2001; Slamon et al., 2001) patients can still develop resistance
(Slamon et al., 2001). All these observations highlight the importance of discovering new
therapeutic tools interfering with HER2-driven signalling to overcome therapy resistance.

Author Manuscript

Here we have demonstrated that treatment of breast cancer cells resistant to Tam with the
FXR natural ligand CDCA resulted in a reduction of HER2 protein expression. Similar
results were also obtained in the ERα-negative and HER2-overexpressing SKBR3 breast
cancer cells suggesting that it may represent a general mechanism not related to cell
specificity. Moreover, it assumes more relevance in Tam-resistant breast cancer cells which
are strongly dependent on HER2 activity for their growth. The complete abrogation of FXRmediated HER2 down-regulation with expression of a FXR dominant negative vector, along
with the effects exerted by the synthetic FXR agonist GW4064, clearly demonstrated that
activated-FXR is involved in the regulation of HER2 expression. Furthermore, quantitative
RT-PCR analysis demonstrated that HER2 mRNA levels were significantly decreased in
both MCF-7 and MCF-7TR1 cells treated with CDCA, suggesting that the FXR-induced
HER2 down-regulation arises via transcriptional mechanisms. Therefore, in our study we
focused on the molecular mechanisms by which FXR mediates repression of HER2 gene
expression, and on the biological consequences of FXR activation on antiestrogen-resistant
growth of breast cancer cells.

Author Manuscript

FXR acts mainly by regulating the expression of target genes by binding either as a
monomer or heterodimer with the retinoid X receptor (RXR) to FXR response elements
(FXREs) (Laffitte et al., 2000; Ananthanarayanan et al., 2001; Claudel et al., 2002; Kalaany
and Mangelsdorf, 2006;). Human HER2 promoter did not display any FXREs, thus it is
reasonable to hypothesize that FXR induced down-regulation of HER2 promoter activity
may occur through its interaction with other transcriptional factors. For instance, it has been
described the trans-repression mechanisms for FXR-mediated inhibition of endothelin
(ET)-1 expression in vascular endothelial cells (He et al., 2006). In addition, it has also been
demonstrated that FXR negatively regulates IL-1β expression by stabilizing the nuclear
corepressor NCoR on the NF-κB sequence within the IL-1β promoter (Vavassori et al.,
2009). Several recognition elements are present within the HER2 proximal promoter (Ishii et
al., 1987; Hurst, 2001) and among these functional motifs we have identified both AP-1 and
NF-κB response elements as potential targets of FXR. We have demonstrated by functional

studies and site specific mutagenesis analysis that the integrity of the NF-κB sequence is a
prerequisite for the downregulatory effects of the FXR ligand on HER2 promoter activity.
These results were supported by EMSA experiments which revealed a marked decrease in a
specific DNA binding complex in nuclear extracts from MCF-7 and MCF-7TR1 cells
treated with CDCA. In vitro competition studies showed that FXR protein was able to
inhibit the binding of NF-κB to its consensus site on the HER2 promoter. Furthermore, we
observed a reduced recruitment of both NF-κB and RNA polymerase II in CDCA treated
cells, concomitant with an enhanced recruitment of HDAC3 supporting a negative
transcriptional role for FXR in modulating HER2 expression.

Author Manuscript

The physiological relevance of these effects is pointed out by proliferation studies showing
that FXR activation reduced breast cancer cell growth, but did not affect the proliferation of
the nontumorogenic breast epithelial MCF-10A cell line. MCF-7TR1 cells exhibited lower
IC50 values for both ligands compared with parental MCF-7 cells, suggesting an higher
sensitivity of the Tam resistant cells to the effects of FXR ligands. This suggestion is also
well supported by the results obtained from growth assays showing that combined treatment
with CDCA and Tam significantly reduced Tam-resistant growth in MCF-7TR1 cells,
compared to Tam alone, but had no additive effects in MCF-7 parental cells. Moreover,
FXR ligands failed to inhibit tam-resistant growth in MCF-7/HER2-18 cells in which HER2
expression is not driven by its own gene promoter activity. These latter results provided
evidences that the down-regulation of HER2 expression at transcriptional level underlies the
ability of activated FXR to inhibit tam-resistant growth in breast cancer cells.

Author Manuscript

Previous in vitro studies showed that enhanced EGFR/HER2 expression together with
activation of downstream signalling pathways such as p42/44 MAPK are involved in
acquired Tam resistance (Knowlden et al., 2003; Nicholson et al., 2004). Our studies
showed that CDCA treatment significantly reduced the ability of EGF to activate its signal
transduction cascade in MCF-7TR1 cells, inhibiting both HER2 and MAPK
phosphorylation. In addition, FXR activation was associated with a marked inhibition in
EGF-induced growth, concomitant with a reduction in cyclin D1 expression in Tam resistant
breast cancer cells. All together these data demonstrate, as graphically represented in Figure
8, that activated FXR, by preventing the binding of NF-κB to its response element located in
the HER2 promoter sequence, abrogates HER2 expression and signalling, resulting in an
inhibition of Tam resistant growth in breast cancer cells.

Author Manuscript

Deciphering the molecular mechanisms responsible for the development of hormonal
resistance is essential for establishing the most appropriate hormone agent according to
tumor characteristics and for defining the optimal sequence of endocrine therapies.
Moreover, this knowledge is critical for development of new therapeutic approaches able to
either overcome or prevent endocrine resistance in breast cancer patients. Over the last
years, significant survival benefits for breast cancer were derived from the use of combined
treatment of endocrine therapies with new targeted therapies in endocrine responsive breast
cancer (Johnston, 2009). In this scenario the sequencing or the combination of tamoxifen
with FXR ligands may represent an important research issue to explore as an alternative
therapeutic strategy to treat breast cancer patients whose tumors exploit HER2 signaling to
escape Tam treatment.

Cells were treated as indicated before lysis for total protein extraction (Catalano et al.,
2010). Nuclear extracts were prepared as described (Morelli et al., 2004). For
coimmunoprecipitation experiments, we used 1 mg of nuclear protein extract and 2µg of
FXR polyclonal antisera, followed by protein A/G precipitation. Equal amounts of cell
extracts and coimmunoprecipitated protein were subjected to SDS-PAGE, as described
(Catalano et al., 2010).
RT-PCR and Real-time RT-PCR assays
FXR gene expression was evaluated by the reverse transcription-PCR method using a
RETROscript kit. The cDNAs obtained were amplified by PCR using the following primers:
forward 5’-CGAGCCTGAAGAGTGGTACTGTC-3’ and reverse 5’CATTCAGCCAACATTCCCATCTC-3’ (FXR); forward 5’-CTCAACATCTCC
CCCTTCTC-3’ and reverse 5’- CAAATCCCATATCCTCGT -3’ (36B4).

The PCR was performed for 35 cycles for hFXR (94°C 1 min, 65°C 1 min, 72°C 1 min) and
18 cycles for 36B4 (94 °C for 1 min, 58 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min) as described
(Catalano et al., 2010).

Analysis of HER2 gene expression was performed by Real-time RT–PCR. Total RNA (2µg)
was reverse transcribed with the RETROscript kit; 5µl of diluted (1:3) cDNA were analysed
in triplicates by real-time PCR in an iCycler iQ Detection System (Bio-Rad, USA) using
SYBR Green Universal PCR Master Mix following the manufacturer’s recommendations.
Negative control contained water instead of cDNA was used. Each sample was normalized
on its GAPDH mRNA content. Primers used for the amplification were: forward 5’CACCTACAACACAGACACGTTTGA-3’ and reverse 5’GCAGACGAGGGTGCAGGAT-3’ (HER2); forward 5’CCCACTCCTCCACCTTTGAC-3’ and reverse 5’-TGTTGCTGTAGCCAAATTCGTT-3’
(GAPDH). The relative gene expression levels were calculated as described (Sirianni et al.,
2007).
Transient transfection assays
MCF-7 and MCF-7TR1 cells were transiently transfected using the FuGENE 6 reagent with
FXR reporter gene (FXRE-IR1) in the presence or absence of FXR-DN plasmid. In a set of
experiments MCF-7, MCF-7TR1 and SKBR3 cells were transfected with different HER2

promoter constructs for 24h followed by treatments, and luciferase activity was assayed as
described (Catalano et al., 2010).
Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA)

Author Manuscript

Nuclear extracts from cells, treated or not for 3h with CDCA 50µM, were prepared as
previously described (Andrews and Faller, 1991). The DNA sequences used as probe or as
cold competitors are the following (nucleotide motifs of interest are underlined and
mutations are shown as lowercase letters): NF-κB, 5’AAGTGAAGCTGGGAGTTGCCGACTCCCAGA-3’; mutated NF-κB, 5’AAGTGAAGCTaatcGTTGCCGACTCCCAGA-3’; AP-1, 5’-AGGGGGCAGAGTCAC
CAGCCTCTG-3’; mutated AP-1, 5’-AGGGGGCAtcaTCACCAGCCTCTG-3’; Sp1 5’ATCCCGGACTCCGGGGGAGGGGGC-3’; mutated Sp1, 5’-ATCCCGGACCTCattG
GGAGGGGGC-3’. In vitro transcribed and translated FXR protein was synthesized using
the T7 polymerase in the rabbit reticulocyte lysate system. Probe generation and the proteinbinding reactions were carried out as previously described (Catalano et al., 2010). For
experiments involving anti-NF-κB (p65) antibody, the reaction mixture was incubated with
this antibody at 4°C for 12h before addition of labelled probe.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays

Author Manuscript

Cells were treated with CDCA 50µM or left untreated for 1h and then DNA/protein
complexes were extracted as previously described (Catalano et al., 2010). The precleared
chromatin was immunoprecipitated with specific anti NF-κB (p65), anti HDAC3 or anti
polymerase II antibodies. A normal mouse serum IgG was used as negative control. A 5µl
volume of each sample and input DNA were used for real time PCR using the primers
flanking NF-κB sequence in the human HER2 promoter region: 5’TGAGAACGGCTGCAGGCAAC-3’ and 5’-CCCACCAACTGCATTCCAA-3’. Real-time
PCR analysis was performed as described above. Final results were calculated using the
ΔΔCt method, using input Ct values instead of the GAPDH mRNA. The basal sample was
used as calibrator.
Statistical analyses
Each datum point represents the mean ± S.D. of three different experiments. Data were
analyzed by Student’s t test using the GraphPad Prism 4 software program. P<0.05 was
considered as statistically significant.

of vehicle (−) or CDCA 50 µM for 1h, then cross-linked with formaldehyde, and lysed. The
precleared chromatin was immunoprecipitated with anti-NF-κB (b), anti-RNA Pol II (c) and
anti-HDCA3 (d) antibodies. 5µl volume of each sample and input were analyzed by real
time PCR using specific primers to amplify HER2 promoter sequence including the NF-κB
site. Similar results were obtained in multiple independent experiments. * p<0.01 compared
to vehicle.

Effects of FXR ligand on SKBR3 breast cancer cells. (a) MTT proliferation assay of SKBR3
cells treated with vehicle (−) or increasing doses of CDCA (12,5–25–50–100 µM) for 7
days. Results are expressed as fold change ± SD relative to vehicle treated cells, and are
representative of three different experiments each performed in triplicate. (b) Soft Agar
growth assay in SKBR3 cells plated in 0.35% agarose and treated with vehicle (−) or CDCA
50 µM. After 14 days of growth colonies > 50 µm diameter were counted. (c) SKBR3 cells
were treated as indicated with vehicle (−) or CDCA 50µM before lysis. Equal amounts of
total cellular extract were analyzed for HER2 levels by Western blotting. β-Actin was used
as loading control. Numbers on top of the blots represent the average fold change relative to
control normalized for β-Actin. (d) mRNA HER2 content, evaluated by real time RT-PCR,
after treatment with vehicle (−) or CDCA 50µM as indicated. Each sample was normalized
to its GAPDH mRNA content. (e) SKBR3 cells were transiently transfected with pNeuLite
construct. After transfection cells were treated in the presence of vehicle (−) or CDCA 50
µM for 24h and the promoter activity was evaluated. The values represent the means ± SD
of three different experiments each performed in triplicate. * p<0.05 compared to vehicle. (f)

Proposed working model of the FXR-mediated regulation of HER2 expression in Tamresistant breast cancer cells. In the absence of CDCA, HER2 expression is regulated by
several serum factors, including NF-κB, acting through a regulatory region in HER2
promoter and enabling gene transcription. Upon CDCA treatment, FXR binds NF-κB
inhibiting its recruitment on the response element located in the proximal HER2 promoter,
causing displacement of RNA polymerase II with consequent repression of HER2
expression.
