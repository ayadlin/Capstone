ABSTRACT
Chemoresistance is a major clinical problem compromising the successful
treatment of cancer. One exciting approach is the eradication of cancer stem/tumorinitiating cells (jointly CSCs), which account for tumor initiation, progression, and drug
resistance. Here we show for the first time, with mechanism-based evidence, that
ginsenoside-Rb1, a natural saponin isolated from the rhizome of Panax quinquefolius
and notoginseng, exhibits potent cytotoxicity on CSCs. Rb1 and its metabolite
compound K could effectively suppress CSC self-renewal without regrowth. Rb1 and
compound K treatment also sensitized the CSCs to clinically relevant doses of cisplatin
and paclitaxel. These effects were associated with the Wnt/β-catenin signaling
pathway by downregulating β-catenin/T-cell factor-dependent transcription and
expression of its target genes ATP-binding cassette G2 and P-glycoprotein. We also
identified reversal of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition as a new player in the Rb1
and compound K-mediated inhibition of CSCs. Rb1 and compound K treatment also
inhibited the self-renewal of CSCs derived from ovarian carcinoma patients as well as
in xenograft tumor model. Moreover, we did not observe toxicity in response to doses
of Rb1 and compound K that produced an anti-CSC effect. Therefore, Rb1 should be
explored further as a promising nutraceutical prototype of treating refractory tumors.

the entire tumor. Thus, strategies aiming at targeting CSCs
represent rational approaches for cancer prevention and
treatment. Plant-derived small molecules that exhibit potent
antitumor activity but low toxicity and limited side effects
could be promising new treatment modalities.
Therapeutic values of ginseng (the rhizome of Panax
ginseng), a key ingredient in Chinese traditional medicine,
have been recognized for >1,000 years [2]. It is now one of
the most popular alternative medicines widely consumed
worldwide and appears in the pharmacopeias of several
countries, including the United States and Europe and
employed for cancer, diabetes, and cardiovascular concerns.
In recent years, ginseng has gained considered attention for
the prevention and/or treatment of cancers in epidemiological,
basic, and clinical research. This is supported by the findings

INTRODUCTION
Chemotherapy has been the mainstay of cancer
treatment for the past several decades. Yet, there is little
evidence for progress in reducing cancer mortality, because
most of the patients ultimately relapse. The recent discovery
of cancer stem/tumor-initiating cells (jointly CSCs) has
changed our view of carcinogenesis and chemoresistance
[1]. In contrast to other tumor cells, CSCs represent a
subpopulation that possesses the ability to self-renew and
differentiate, properties that render these cells particularly
resistant to therapy. As such, it is conceivable that the
relapse after remission is likely due to the inability of
current chemotherapeutic drugs to kill CSCs. Despite the
tumor bulk elimination, CSCs are capable of reproducing

on its ability to reduce the incidence of carcinogen-induced
tumors in mice and to inhibit the growth of tumor cells in
vitro [3]. A dose-dependent decrease in the risk of cancer as
a regular consumption of ginseng in both prospective and
case-control studies and a better survival rate and a greater
quality of life are also noted [4]. Notably, such effects are not
observed in patients using other Chinese traditional medicine
[5]. This opens up the exciting possibility of ginseng as an
important drug, emphasizing the importance to uncover the
exact component(s) in the ginseng extract that contribute to
the antitumor function and evaluate its pharmacological action.
Emerging evidence shows that nonpeptide small
molecules, such as saponins, exhibit potent cytotoxicity, with
great potential to be developed as chemotherapeutic agents
[6]. A notable saponin isolated from P. quinquefolius and
notoginseng is ginsenoside-Rb1, which constitutes 0.37-0.5%
of ginseng extract [7, 8]. Most (~70%) orally administered
Rb1 is metabolized by intestinal bacteria to its final derivative
20-O-β-D-glucopyranosyl-20(S)-protopanaxadiol
(also
called compound K) [9]. Compound K is reported to be
easily absorbed and sustained longer in the human body.
Nevertheless, the key targets of ginsenoside Rb1 and its
metabolite compound K have not been explored. Nor is it
clear about the molecular mechanisms.
In this study, we show for the first time that Rb1
and its metabolite compound K specifically target the
formation and expansion of CSCs. We further provide
evidence that Rb1 and compound K can chemosensitize
CSCs to clinical anticancer drugs cisplatin and paclitaxel,
inducing a synergistic cytotoxicity via Wnt/β-catenin
signaling and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT)
regulation, both attractive targets for cancer treatment.

compound K suppressed tumor cell survival (Figure 1A).
The LC50 (the concentration that leads to 50% survival)
were 250 nM for Rb1 and 100 nM compound K in
SKOV-3 and 230 nM for Rb1 and 125 nM for compound
K in HEYA8, respectively. A clinically relevant dose of
imatinib also gave similar results (Figure 1B) [10]. In
accordance with this, trypan blue exclusion assay showed
a 1.5-fold increase in cell death for Rb1 and compound
K in SKOV-3 and a 1.4- and 2-fold increase in HEYA8,
respectively (Figure 2A). Furthermore, Rb1 and compound
K displayed a significant 5.9- and 9.6-fold in SKOV-3 and
1.6 and 2.9- fold in HEYA8 cells increase in apoptosis as
revealed by the expression of the active (cleaved) caspase
3 (Figure 2B), suggesting that apoptosis may account
for this loss of cell viability. Subsequently, CSCs were
treated with 250 nM Rb1 and 125 nM compound K for
different periods of time (0, 24, and 48 h). We evaluated
CSC marker expression in response to Rb1 or compound
K treatment. Three different markers of ovarian CSCs,
Bmi-1, Nanog, and Oct4, were tested. Rb1 or compound K
depleted all these markers expression in a time-dependent
manner, with the maximal effects observed 48 hours
following treatment (Figure 3A), reflecting Rb1- and
compound K-dependent inhibition of CSC self-renewal
and growth of chemotherapy-resistant CSCs.

No regrowth (relapse) upon Rb1 and its
metabolite compound K treatment
Because sphere forming capabilities in serial passages
is an indirect marker in support of stem cell renewal, we
further determined the effect of Rb1 and compound K
in relapse experiment. SKOV-3 and HEYA8 primary
spheroids treated with either control vehicle, 250 nM Rb1,
or 125 nM compound K were dissociated and replated
as secondary spheroids. By day 2, cells from the control
group started growing as secondary spheroids, whereas
Rb1- or compound K-treated cells did not (Figure 3B). For
approximately 6 days, secondary spheroids did not form
from Rb1- or compound K-treated samples, whereas control
samples developed dense secondary/tertiary spheroids
(Figure 3B). Furthermore, the removal of these compounds
did not restore the ability of both SKOV-3 and HEYA8 to
form spheroids upon serial passage (data not shown). These
results suggest that Rb1 and compound K inhibit CSC selfrenewal, and that this process is irreversible.

RESULTS
Cytotoxic and anti-proliferative effects of Rb1
and its metabolite compound K on ovarian CSCs
Ovarian cancer is a highly chemoresistant cancer
that is rapidly fatal and most patients will develop tumor
recurrence and succumb to chemoresistant disease. Thus,
it provides an excellent model to identify the mechanisms
required for this drug resistance. Using a functional
enrichment strategy based on the self-renewal ability
of CSCs to grow as nonadherent spheres under stemcell-selective condition which recapitulates advanced
stages of ovarian carcinoma cells in malignant ascites,
we have successfully identified CSCs in ovarian cancer
cell lines and cancerous ovarian tissues [10]. Here we
first investigated the possible cytotoxic effect of Rb1
and its metabolite compound K on SKOV-3 and HEYA8
CSCs. Figure 1A shows dose-dependent effect of Rb1
and compound K on both line-derived CSCs on tumor
sphere formation and growth. In addition, the spheres
formed upon Rb1 or compound K treatment were smaller
compared with the control (Figure 1). Both Rb1 and

Rb1 and its metabolite compound K reduce CSC
resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs
The higher drug resistance of CSCs encouraged us
to assess whether Rb1 and compound K will be effective
in increasing the treatment efficacy. Rb1 or compound K
was used alone or in combination with cisplatin/paclitaxel,
the two front-line chemotherapeutic agents currently
used for treating unresectable ovarian cancer. We found

cisplatin and paclitaxel at clinically relevant does of 50
μM and 100 nM had little effect of SKOV-3 and HEYA8
CSCs [11], and only a partial decrease in sphere formation
was observed (Figure 4A). On the other hand, Rb1 or
compound K in combination with the same doses of
cisplatin or paclitaxel sensitizes these CSCs to both drugs
(SKOV-3: Rb1, Rb1 + cisplatin, and Rb1+ paclitaxel, P
< 0.0001; compound K, compound K + cisplatin, and
compound K + paclitaxel, P < 0.0001; HEYA8: Rb1, P =
0.004, Rb1 + cisplatin, and Rb1 + paclitaxel, P < 0.0001;
compound K, P = 0.004, compound K + cisplatin, P <
0.0001, and compound K + paclitaxel, P = 0.001) (Figure
4A). In addition, treatment of CSCs isolated from primary
ovarian cancer samples inhibited both sphere formation
and growth, demonstrating drug-induced death by Rb1 or
compound K or in combination with cisplatin or paclitaxel
consistently supported the in vitro observations (Rb1, CK,

Rb1 + cisplatin, Rb1 + paclitaxel, compound K + cisplatin
and compound K + paclitaxel, P < 0.0001) (Figure 4B).

Compound K inhibits EMT to exert cytotoxic
effects
Rb1 is readily metabolized to compound K in the
gut, and this biotransformation appears to contribute
to the reported pharmacological effects of Rb1 [9]. We
therefore focus on the molecular mechanisms underlying
the action of compound K for the relevance. Emerging
evidence suggests an intricate role of EMT in CSC selfrenewal [12]. To this end, we first determined the levels
of EMT transcription factors. Our results showed that
treatment with compound K in the presence of cisplatin
and paclitaxel was associated with a marked decrease in
the expression of Snail and Slug (Figure 5B). Furthermore,

in correlation with our findings from Snail/Slug, we
also observed compound K substantially reverted the
inhibition of E-cadherin expression, an epithelial marker,
and its concomitant increase of N-cadherin expression, a
mesenchymal marker (Figure 5B). Similar experiments
with Rb1 revealed changes in expression indistinguishable
from those in compound K (data not shown). We
next determined the molecular mechanisms by which
compound K inhibited Snail/Slug expression. Because
studies have shown that the PI3K/Akt and ERK1/2
mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways are critical for
the activation of Snail/Slug in some cell types [13, 14], we
first examined the levels of phosphorylated (active) forms
of Akt and ERK1/2 in SKOV-3 and HEYA8 cells treated
with compound K. As shown, addition of compound K
to the cells significantly decreased the phosphorylation
of Akt and ERK1/2 (Figure 6A). To assess the functional
significance of compound K-suppressed Akt and ERK1/2
in Snail/Slug expression, we used constitutively active
constructs of Akt (E17K) and MEK1 (CA-MEK1).
Both Snail and Slug expression were clearly reverted in
E17K- and CA-MEK1-transfected cells upon compound
K treatment (Figure 6B). These results reveal a key role
of Rb1 and compound K in combination with cisplatin
and paclitaxel in EMT regulation and show that these
compounds also have a role in EMT-regulated CSCs.

12.5-fold in compound K treatment for SKOV-3, and
22.4 and 38.4-fold in compound K treatment for HEYA8,
respectively (Figure 8A). Likewise, the chemosensitizing
effect in CSCs by compound K could be reversed by
expression of a stable mutant form of β-catenin (S37A)
(Figure 8B). There was also a clear decrease of druginduced cell death by the expression of constitutively
active TCF (VP16-TCF) (Figure 8B). These results present
the first evidence that compound K inhibit the Wnt/βcatenin signaling in CSC cells, and that these effects were
mediated through its downstream CSC-driven effectors
ABCG2 and P-glycoprotein.

Efficacy of compound K and chemotherapy in
CSCs in vivo
To further validate its role in vivo, we used mouse
xenograft ovarian tumors. Treatment with compound K
alone was effective in inhibiting tumor growth compared
with vehicle control (Figure 9A). However, treatment with
compound K in combination with cisplatin or paclitaxel
resulted in even greater reduction in tumor volume
(compound K + cisplatin, 50.2%, P < 0.05; compound K +
paclitaxel, 45.6%, P < 0.05). Furthermore, the combination
therapy was statistically superior to cisplatin or paclitaxel
alone (compound K + cisplatin, compound K + paclitaxel,
P < 0.05) (Figure 9A). Further, compound K also induced
caspase-3 expression in vivo, indicating apoptosis
activation in compound K-treated HEYA8 xenografts
(Figure 9C). These results demonstrate that compound
K is potent in suppressing tumor growth from CSCs
in vivo and that these effects are cytotoxic rather than
cytostatic. The compound K regimens were well-tolerated
to the tested animals. There was no abnormal behavior
or weight loss noted during the entire treatment period
(Figure 9B). Moreover, histopathological observations of
the liver, heart, kidney, spleen, and lungs in the treated
animals showed no histological alterations as compared to
the controls (Figure 10A). Blood chemistry showed that
compound K did not cause a significant increase in lactate
dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST),
alanine transaminase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP),
creatine kinase (CK) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN)
(Figure 10B), hence showing that compound K has no
adverse effects to the liver, heart, and renal function.

Compound K inhibits the Wnt/β-catenin
signaling pathway in CSCs
Next, we inquired the mechanism by which
compound K inhibits CSC survival and its possible role
in chemoresistance. β-catenin, which plays a pivotal
role in self-renewal or tumorigenesis, is a particular
intriguing property [15]. Since the elevated levels of
β-catenin could direct cell fate [16], we examined the
expression of β-catenin in compound K treated CSCs by
Western blot analysis. We observed a marked decrease
of β-catenin levels upon compound K treatment (Figure
7A). β-catenin is known to interact with T-cell factor
(TCF)/LEF to activate the transcription of target genes
[17], and evidence exists that correlate increased levels
of β-catenin with increased levels of nuclear active
β-catenin [18]. Hence, we studied the effect of compound
K on the transcriptional activity of β-catenin/TCF using
luciferase reporter plasmids encoding multimerized
wildtype (TOPFLASH) or mutated (FOPFLASH) TCF
binding sites, which have been widely used to characterize
β-catenin/TCF-dependent gene expression [19]. In support
of the observation, compound K treatment significantly
inhibited TOPFLASH activation (Figure 7B) Importantly,
compound K led to a sharp decrease in the expression of
ABCG2 and P-glycoprotein, two major drug transporters
that are implicated in the efflux chemotherapeutic drugs
and are targets of β-catenin/TCF [10, 12]. The levels
of ABCG2 and P-glycoprotein were reduced 12.8 and

DISCUSSION
Tumor cell resistance to chemotherapies still forms
a major barrier toward effective cancer therapy. This
paper presents two important findings. First, Rb1 and
its metabolite compound K inhibit CSCs. Second, these
compounds enhance cisplatin and paclitaxel anti-cancer
effect. These effects are at least in part due to inhibition
of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway and EMT. To
our knowledge, CSCs chemosensitization has not been

documented in ginseng as well as in other traditional
Chinese medicine. Our studies represent the first to report
the phenomenon and elucidate the signaling mechanisms
involved. The combination of these natural products and
chemotherapeutic drugs could be of great therapeutic
value if included in the treatment regimens.
Ginseng is listed in pharmacopeias and has
been widely used in China for medicinal purposes for
thousands of years due to its rich content of saponins.
Ginsenoside is one of the most widely characterized
saponins in the rhizome of ginseng. Ginseng also has a
chemopreventive potential in the context of ovarian cancer
as seen in a mouse model [5]. For example, it has been
demonstrated that ginsenoside Rg3 in combination with
cyclophosphamide could improve the living quality and

survival time of mice with ovarian tumors [20]. Moreover,
case-control studies have pointed toward preventive
effects of ginseng products had a preventive effect on
ovarian cancer [21]. These results suggest that ginseng
might be an ideal cancer chemotherapeutic agent.
Several activities of Rb1 make it desirable both
as a therapeutic and as a chemopreventive agent: (a)
Unlike other saponins, which often have poor absorption
and rapid excretion, Rb1 seems to exhibit a better
bioavailability and a desirable duration of action [22]. (b)
Rb1 disrupts many of the characteristic cancer promoting
activities [23]. (c) In addition, Rb1 has shown to improve
the functions of normal cells, such as cardioprotective,
hepatoprotective and anti-inflammatory activities, which
provide definite advantages than currently used drugs

[24–27]. Rb1 has various anti-cancer properties ranging
from the inhibition of cell proliferation to angiogenesis as
well as in apoptosis induction [28, 29]. Structure-activity
analyses suggest that ginsenosides metabolites with
less sugar moieties have greater anti-cancer activities.
Indeed, among all ginsenosides, compound K (one sugar
residue) is found to possess the most potent tumor growth
and invasion suppressing activities [30]. We observed
that compound K possesses very significant anti-CSC
activities as compared to Rb1. The IC50 for compound K
for inhibiting CSC sphere formation and growth was 125
nM, suggesting that its anti-CSC effect is greater than that
of Rb1. The difference in the number of sugar moieties
may mediate their different affinities towards molecular
targets.
Cisplatin and paclitaxel are two mainstays of
anti-cancer drugs in the clinical treatment of ovarian
cancer. In addition to the dose-limiting toxicities, their
drug resistance poses another major problem for their
clinical use [31]. In the present study, we demonstrate
that Rb1 and compound K specifically enhances these
chemotherapeutic treatments, and that these changes
occur at pharmacologically attainable drug levels [11].
Moreover, non-toxic, low doses of cisplatin and paclitaxel
with Rb1 and compound K can also induce an enhanced
cytotoxic response in the cancer cells (data not shown),
suggesting a potential avenue to improve the clinical
efficacy. Our findings may also provide a probable
explanation as to why Rb1 and its metabolite-containing
PPD have substantial benefit in chemoresistant tumors
[32]. Imatinib is used in the treatment of a number of
cancers, including ovarian cancer [33–36]. We found
that Rb1 and compound K had similar efficiency as
imatinib in cell growth inhibition and apoptosis induction.
Importantly, compound K might imatinib, as it is less
sensitive to some resistance mechanisms cancer cells
develop [37]. We further identified several mechanisms of
action induced by compound K, such as inactivation of
ABCG2 and P-gp.
The presence of activated β-catenin in a broad
spectrum of human cancers makes Wnt/β-catenin
signaling an attractive target for cancer treatment. Wnt/
β-catenin signaling has also been implicated in ovarian
cancer. While mutations in adenomatous polyposis coli
or β-catenin gene are infrequent, an increased β-catenin
level and/or altered Wnt/β-catenin signaling are commonly
found in different ovarian cancer subtypes and that high
β-catenin expression correlates with tumor grade and poor
prognosis [38–40]. It is also relevant that Wnt/β-catenin
is significantly overexpressed in recurrent lesions [10,
41]. Therefore, the compound K-dependent inhibition of
Wnt/β-catenin may hold great value in treating patients
with refractory ovarian cancer. ABC transporters are wellestablished efflux pumps contributing to drug resistance,
which are molecular and functional properties of a distinct
side population of cells. It has been demonstrated that
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

ABCG2 and P-glycoprotein are the two most important
genes for the chemoresistance of CSCs [42–44]. There is
emerging evidence that inhibition of Wnt/β-catenin and
drug transporters can eradicate CSCs, but to be nontoxic
to normal cells/tissue stem cells [45].
There is increasing evidence that the induction of
EMT in transformed ovarian cancer cells in vitro or in
mouse models to generate cells with CSC characteristics,
indicating that EMT may be implicated in ovarian cancer
aggressiveness [46, 47]. Moreover, CSCs derived from
ovarian tumors and metastatic ovarian peritoneal effusions
express EMT-associated markers, and that high expression
of EMT-inducing genes enhances the metastatic potential
for ovarian cancer cells [48]. Our studies reveal a role for
Rb1 and compound K in linking EMT and CSCs, which
not only shed light on the molecular mechanisms of action
but also suggest new therapeutic strategy that warrants
clinical investigation.
Therapeutic selectivity is one of the most critical
considerations in cancer treatment. Ginseng has been
shown to be well-tolerated even at very high doses in
patients but nontoxic to normal human cells [49]. We
have also shown the differential effects of Rb1 and
compound K in ovarian cancer and normal human
ovarian surface epithelial cells (Supplementary Figure
S1). Pharmacokinetics of Rb1 has not been determined in
humans. However, the dosage (250 nM) utilized in this
study in vitro is similar to the pharmacologically attainable
levels of 145-196 nM in the plasma in consuming per
gram of Rb1, based on the oral bioavailability of 4.35%
of Rb1 in animal studies [50]. Treatment with Rb1 within
this dosage range is highly effective in inhibiting ovarian
cancer growth and does not seem to exhibit toxicity.
Indeed, different phase I trials have shown that Rb1 is safe
when consumed at doses as high as 10 g root and a dose of
ginsenosides smaller than 300 mg/kg [51, 52].
In summary, this study shows for the first time that
ginsenoside Rb1, especially its metabolite compound K,
specifically target CSCs via simultaneous inhibition of
Wnt/β-catenin signaling and EMT in ovarian cancer. The
ability of Rb1 and its metabolite compound K to intervene
different cellular pathways in CSCs suggests that Rb1 can
be a wide spectrum chemopreventive agent for cancer
treatment. These findings are highly clinical significant,
and will provide a solid scientific background in the
development of Rb1 and compound K in ginseng-based
therapeutics for the treatment of relapsed cancers which
currently have limited pharmaceutical options.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cells and cell culture
Human ovarian carcinoma cell lines SKOV-3 and
HEYA8 were gifts from Dr. N. Auersperg (University of
British Columbia, Vancouver, B. C., Canada) and Dr. J. Liu
25910

Oncotarget

(MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX), respectively.
Isolation and culture of CSCs from SKOV-3 and HEYA8
or primary human ovarian cancer samples were performed
in serum-free stem cell-selective condition as described
in Chau et al. [10]. For the relapse experiment, control/
treated primary spheroids were dissociated and replated
as secondary spheroids and imaged daily. Primary tumor
samples were obtained from ovarian cancer patients with
informed consent and approval by the Taipei Medical
University Institutional Review Board. Cisplatin and
paclitaxel were purchased from Calbiochem (San Diego,
CA) and were used at 50 μM and 100 nM concentration,
respectively.

Proliferation and chemosensitivity analysis

Reverse transcription and PCR

Cells were incubated for 5 min at room temperature
with an equal volume of 0.4% (w/v) trypan blue solution
(Sigma, St. Louis, MO). Cells were counted using a dualchamber hemocytometer under a light microscope. Viable
and nonviable cells were recorded.

Rates of proliferation and sensitivity to
drugs were assessed using the colorimetric MTT
(3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide) assay according to the manufacturer’s
instructions (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). Briefly, 500 μl
MTT solution was added to each well and the plate was
incubated for 4 h at 37oC. Medium was then aspirated from
each well, and 250 μl DMSO was added. Colorimetric
analysis was performed at a wavelength of 570 nm using
a microplate reader (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA).

Trypan blue exclusion assay

Total RNA was extracted with Trizol and reversed
transcribed, and the cDNA was synthesized using the
first-stranded cDNA synthesis kit (Invitrogen). The
sequences of the specific primers were as follows:
Bmi-1: sense 5’-ATGTGTGTGCTTTGTGGAG-3’,
antisense
5’-AGTGGTCTGGTCTTGTGAAC-3’;
Nanog: sense 5’-AAGACAAGGTCCCGGTCAAG-3’,
antisense
5’-CCTAGTGGTCTGCTGTATTAC-3’;
Oct4: sense 5’-ATCCTGGGGGTTCTATT TGG3’, antisense 5’-TCTCCAGGTTGCCTCTCACT-3’;
ABCG2: sense 5’-CTGAGA TCCTGAGCCTTTGG-3’,
antisense 5’-TGCCCATCACAACATCATCT-3’; and
P-glycoprotein: sense 5’-ACCTGTGAAGAGTAGAAC
ATGAAGA-3’, antisense 5’-AAGATCCATTCCGACCT
CGC-3’. β-actin served as a control. The PCR
conditions used to amplify Bmi-1, Oct4, ABCG2, and
P-glycoprotein were: 33 cycles at 95oC for 30 s, 55oC for
30 s, and 72oC for 30 s. To analyze expression of Nanog,
the thermocycling parameters for the PCR reactions were:
35 cycles at 95oC for 30 s, 55oC for 30 s, and 72oC for 30 s.

β-catenin/TCF reporter gene assay
Cells were transiently transfected with 0.5 μg of the
TOPFLASH or FOPFLASH reporter plasmid (Clontech)
using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen). Transfection efficiencies
were determined by co-transfection of the β-galactosidase
construct. Luciferase and β-galactosidase activity were
assayed according to the manufacturer’s protocol using the
luciferase assay kit from Promega. Luciferase activity in
each well was normalized to the β-galactosidase activity.
All experiments were assayed in triplicates, and the assay
was performed in three independent experiments.

In vivo studies
All animal experiments were approved by the
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the
University of Hong Kong. 106 cells were subcutaneously
(s.c.) injected into the right flank of athymic nude
mice. To evaluate the therapeutic effect, treatment was
initiated ~21 days following tumor injection when tumors
reached a detectable size 50 mm3. Mice (n = 3 per group,
repeated three times) were treated by oral gavage, which
was relevant to the dietary administration, with either
vehicle, compound K (50 mg/kg), cisplatin (5 mg/kg),
paclitaxel (2 mg/kg), compound K + cisplatin (50 mg/
kg for compound K, 5 mg/kg for cisplatin), compound
K + paclitaxel (50 mg/kg for compound K, 2 mg/kg for
paclitaxel). Mice were monitored for adverse effects
of therapy and sacrificed on day 28 or when any of the
mice began to appear moribund. Mice weight and tumor
volume were recorded. The length and width of a tumor
were measured with a caliper and tumor volume was
calculated as [(length+width)/2]3. Plasma samples were
collected from retro-orbital sinus and further analyzed
for hepatic, cardiac, and renal functions including LDH,

Western blot analysis
Equal amounts of cell lysate proteins were separated
on 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to
nitrocellulose membrane. Membranes were blocked
for 1 h at room temperature with 5% non-fat milk, and
then incubated overnight at 4oC in the primary antibody:
β-catenin (1:2000) (Transduction Lab, Lexington, KY),
Cleaved caspase-3 (1:1000), caspase-3(1:1000) Snail
(1:1000), Slug (1:1000), phospho-Akt (Ser473) (1:1000),
total Akt (1:1000), phospho-ERK1/2 (Thr202/Tyr204)
(1:1000), total ERK1/2 (1:1000), ABCG2 (1:1000) and
P-glycoprotein (1:1000) (Cell Signaling Technology,
Beverley, MA). β-actin (1:2000) (Sigma, St. Louis, MO)
was used as a loading control. The protein-antibody
complexes were detected by horseradish peroxidiseconjugated secondary antibodies (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA)
followed by the enhanced chemiluminescence detection
reagents (Amersham, Little Chalfont, UK).
