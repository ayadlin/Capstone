Increasing Complexity of High-Grade B-Cell Lymphomas
James O. Armitage, MD1 and R. Gregory Bociek, MD2

In the World Health Organization Classification of Tumors of Hematopoietic and Lymphoid Tissues, high-grade B-cell lymphomas include diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and its numerous subtypes, B-cell lymphoma unclassifiable with features
intermediate between diffuse large B-cell and Burkitt lymphoma, and Burkitt lymphoma.1 However, it is becoming
increasingly clear that morphologic heterogeneity is only part of the picture and that many of these lymphomas are biologically driven by equally complex variations in genetics and protein expression (see Table 1). It is also becoming clear that
specific genetic abnormalities and/or patterns of protein expression can be clinically relevant and have an impact on prognosis and treatment choice—even with lymphomas that appear similar morphogically.
Abnormalities involving the myc avian myelocytomatosis viral oncogene homolog (MYC) and B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia/lymphoma 2 (BCL-2) genes and/or overexpression of MYC protein and the BCL-2 protein have been
the subject of numerous recent reports describing the biologic behavior and prognostic factors in these subsets of highgrade B-cell lymphomas. The worst prognosis generally has been associated with what have been termed “double-hit” lymphomas. This label is usually given to lymphomas with rearrangements of MYC and BCL-2, but some reports apply the
term “double-hit” to lymphomas with rearrangements of any 2 of the 3 genes MYC, BCL-2, and BCL-6. Histologic subtypes of lymphoma that have had “double hits” identified include diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, B-cell lymphoma unclassifiable with features intermediate between diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and Burkitt lymphoma, and follicular
lymphoma.2 “Double hits” appear to be most frequent in B-cell lymphoma unclassifiable with features intermediate
between diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and Burkitt lymphoma, they are observed in a minority of diffuse large B-cell lymphomas, and they appear to be rare in follicular lymphoma.
To make matters even more complicated, recent reports have used the label “double hit” or “double expressers” for
lymphomas that overexpress MYC and BCL-2 protein but either do not have the genes rearranged, or the lymphomas
were not tested for the presence of such rearrangements.4 Patients with high-grade B-cell lymphomas that express both
MYC protein and BCL-2 protein seem to have a worse prognosis than those with lymphomas that do not overexpress
these proteins, but they probably fare better than patients who have lymphomas with genetic double hits. Patients with
high-grade B-cell lymphomas who have a genetically defined double hit have an extremely poor prognosis (the median
survival in most series is <1 year), and these patients often progress on therapy.5,9,10 The optimal treatment for these
patients is unclear, but 1 recent report suggested that combined etoposide, doxorubicin, vincristine plus cyclophosphamide, prednisone, and rituximab (EPOCH-R) might be associated with a better outcome for tumors that express both
MYC and BCL-2 protein11; however, this was not observed in a recent, large, multicenter analysis for genetically defined
double-hit lymphomas.12 Also, in a prospective validation of the outcomes with combined cyclophosphamide, vincristine,
doxorubicin, cytarabine, methotrexate/etoposide, ifosfamide, and cytarabine (CODOX-M/IVAC) in Burkitt lymphoma,6 a small number of cases from that review were determined to be double-hit diffuse large B-cell lymphomas and
were uniformly fatal within 5 months, suggesting that current chemotherapy regimens for aggressive lymphomas like Burkitt lymphoma may be inadequate for many of these double-hit lymphomas.
The prognosis for patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and an isolated MYC translocation or overexpression
of MYC protein is more difficult to discern in our opinion. Although several publications that investigated the presence of

MYC translocations have demonstrated inferior outcomes,13,14 many of those included in their cases at least a
small proportion of double-hit lymphomas (before their
potential significance was recognized), or the authors did
not investigate for the presence of a BCL-2 or BCL-6
translocation. Thus, some of those publications may have
included undiagnosed double-hit lymphomas. In our data
from the University of Nebraska Medical Center in 208
patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, the 5-year
survival rate was 31% for patients with double-hit lymphomas; 47% for patients with either MYC, or BCL-2, or
BCL-6 rearrangements; and 71% for patients with an isolated MYC rearrangement.3
The article by Cohen et al in this issue of Cancer
addresses another important issue regarding patients with
either MYC rearrangements or a combination of MYC
rearrangement and the t(14; 18) translocation as evidence
of a BCL-2 rearrangement.15 Those authors observed that
patients who did not achieve complete remission had a
very short survival, but that a majority of the patients who
did achieve a complete remission had durable remissions.
This applied both to patients with double-hit lymphomas
and to those with an isolated MYC rearrangement. This
result is similar to a report presented at the 2013 American Society for Hematology (ASH) annual meeting using
transplantation in remission,14 but another report indicated a high relapse rate in complete responders with or
without transplantation.16
How should these data be applied in the care of
patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and B-cell
lymphoma unclassifiable with features intermediate
between diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and Burkitt lymphoma who have either an isolated MYC rearrangement
or a double-hit lymphoma involving both MYC and BCL2? On the basis of our experience, we treat patients who
have isolated MYC rearrangement with either EPOCH-R,
1612

which is our first choice in patients who have a very high
proliferative rate (ie, a Ki-67 level 90%), or combined
rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine,
and prednisone (CHOP-R), and we expect an outcome
equivalent to what we observe in other patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. For patients with double-hit
diffuse large B-cell lymphoma or B-cell lymphoma unclassifiable with features intermediate between diffuse large
B-cell lymphoma and Burkitt lymphoma, we favor using
EPOCH-R and offer patients who achieve a remission
(and could tolerate the treatment) an autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in remission. Although
previous reports suggest that, even after achieving a complete remission, patients with double-hit lymphomas have
poor outcomes, this report in Cancer suggests that, for
some of these patients who achieve a complete remission
with frontline chemotherapy, high-dose therapy and autologous transplantation may not be indicated. We have
anecdotally observed a dramatic but short-lived response
to ibrutinib in a patient with a double-hit lymphoma who
had progressed through at least 5 prior chemotherapy regimens. This is obviously a patient population in which
novel targeted therapies need to be tested in combination
with chemoimmunotherapy in the front-line setting,
because the proportion of patients who progress early is so
high, and because many of them do not appear to be salvageable with further conventional chemotherapy
regimens.
