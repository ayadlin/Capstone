Abstract
Glioblastoma multiforme is the most severe form of brain
cancer. First line therapy includes the methylating agent
temozolomide and/or the chloroethylating nitrosoureas [1-(2chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea; CNU] nimustine [1-(4-amino-2methyl-5-pyrimidinyl)methyl-3-(2-chloroethyl)-3-nitrosourea;
ACNU], carmustine [1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea;
BCNU], or lomustine [1-(2-chloroethyl)-3-cyclohexyl-1-nitrosourea; CCNU]. The mechanism of cell death after CNU
treatment is largely unknown. Here we show that ACNU and
BCNU induce apoptosis in U87MG [p53 wild-type (p53wt)] and
U138MG [p53 mutant (p53mt)] glioma cells. However, contrary
to what we observed previously for temozolomide, chloroethylating drugs are more toxic for p53-mutated glioma cells and
induce both apoptosis and necrosis. Inactivation of p53 by
pifithrin-A or siRNA down-regulation sensitized p53wt but not
p53mt glioma cells to ACNU and BCNU. ACNU and BCNU
provoke the formation of DNA double-strand breaks (DSB) in
glioma cells that precede the onset of apoptosis and necrosis.
Although these DSBs are repaired in p53wt cells, they
accumulate in p53mt cells. Therefore, functional p53 seems to
stimulate the repair of CNU-induced cross-links and/or DSBs
generated from CNU-induced lesions. Expression analysis
revealed an up-regulation of xpc and ddb2 mRNA in response
to ACNU in U87MG but not U138MG cells, indicating p53
regulates a pathway that involves these DNA repair proteins.
ACNU-induced apoptosis in p53wt glioma cells is executed via
both the extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathway, whereas in
p53mt glioma cells, the mitochondrial pathway becomes
activated. The data suggest that p53 has opposing effects in
gliomas treated with methylating or chloroethylating agents
and, therefore, the p53 status should be taken into account
when deciding which therapeutic drug to use. [Cancer Res

techniques, radiation, and chemotherapy, treatment of malignant
gliomas remains mostly palliative. Median survival is about 1 year
from the time of diagnosis, and even in the most favorable
situation, most patients die within 2 years (1, 2). Standard therapy
consists of surgical resection followed by radiotherapy. Adjuvant
chemotherapy with carmustine [1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea; BCNU] is commonly prescribed in the United States, and
several clinical trials have been reported with different chemotherapeutic regimens on the basis of chloroethylating nitrosoureas
(3, 4). Alternatively, methylating agents, such as temozolomide,
are now more often used in glioma therapy. Because promoter
methylation of the O 6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase
(MGMT) gene correlates with a benefit in temozolomide therapy
(5), the current standard protocol for the treatment of GBM is
temozolomide concomitant with ionizing radiation. Chloroethylating agents are often used in glioma therapy, but there is no clear
rationale that determines whether methylating or chloroethylating
alkylating drugs should be applied during therapy.
The chloroethylnitrosureas that are in use in cancer therapy are
nimustine [1-(4-amino-2-methyl-5-pyrimidinyl)methyl-3-(2-chloroethyl)-3-nitrosourea; ACNU], BCNU, lomustine [1-(2-chloroethyl)3-cyclohexyl-L-nitrosourea; CCNU], semustine [1-(2-chloroethyl)3-(4-methlycyclohexyl)-1-nitrosourea; MeCCNU], and fotemustine
[1-[N-(2-chloroethyl)-N-nitrosoureido] ethylphosphonic acid diethyl ester]. Although the pharmacokinetics is slightly different, they
are similar at the molecular level. The main target of these drugs is
the DNA, forming upon generation of nucleophilic chloroethylenium ions a wide range of DNA lesions similar to methylating
agents (6). The main killing lesion seems, however, to be O 6chloroethylguanine (7–9). This adduct is unstable, undergoing
intramolecular rearrangement leading to an intermediary N1-O 6ethenoguanine and, in a second step, N1-guanine-N3-cytosine
interstrand cross-links (8, 10). These cross-links are supposed to be
the ultimate killing lesions after treatment with chloroethylating
nitrosoureas ( for review, see ref. 11).
The development of resistance of gliomas to radiation and
chemotherapy is a major problem during the treatment of tumors.
Only a few factors that determine drug resistance of gliomas have
been identified thus far. One is MGMT, which rapidly removes
methyl and chloroethyl groups from the O6-position of guanine
( for review, see ref. 11, 12). Therefore, inactivation of MGMT is
beneficial during therapy (13). Another factor is mismatch repair
that has an impact on the killing effects of methylating but not
chloroethylating agents (14). A third determinant, recently identified, of glioma cell sensitivity to methylating agents is p53 (15, 16).
Temozolomide induces apoptosis in human glioma cells, which is

O 6-Chloroethylguanine–Triggered Cell Death in Gliomas

largely ameliorated by functional p53. This is due to induction
of apoptosis through the extrinsic pathway via Fas/CD95/Apo-1.
In p53 mutant cells, temozolomide induces apoptosis via the
intrinsic apoptotic pathway, which becomes less efficiently
activated than the receptor-driven pathway in response to DNA
methylation (16).
Given the critical role of p53 in temozolomide-induced cell
death in gliomas, we wondered whether p53 would have a
similar effect on cell death after treatment with chloroethylating
agents. The mechanism of cell death after CNU treatment is
unknown. Here we show that ACNU and BCNU induce cell death
by apoptosis in p53 wild-type and p53 mutant glioma cells.
However, in sharp contrast to what we observed previously for
methylating agents, chloroethylating drugs are more toxic in p53
mutated than in p53 wild-type glioma cells. We also show that
in p53 mutant glioma cells, chloroethylating agents trigger both
necrosis and apoptosis, whereas in p53 wild-type cells necrosis
was only marginally induced. Furthermore, we show that in p53
mutant glioma cells, DNA double-strand breaks (DSB) accumulate and the repair genes xpc and ddb2 are not up-regulated in
response to ACNU, indicating a DNA repair defect in these cells
causing hypersensitivity to CNUs. In addition, the data shows
that ACNU-induced apoptosis in p53 wild-type cells occurs via
both the extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathway, whereas in
p53 mutant cells CNUs activate mainly the mitochondrialdependent intrinsic pathway.

Materials and Methods
Cell Culture
U87MG (p53 wild-type), U138MG (p53 mutated), LN229 (p53 wild-type),
and LN308 (p53 mutated) glioma cell lines were routinely grown in DMEM
(Invitrogen Corporation) supplemented with 10% FCS ( fetal bovine serum;
Cultilab) and 1% antibiotic-antimycotic (Invitrogen Corporation), at 37jC in
a humidified 7% CO2 atmosphere. U87MG siPuro and U87MG sip53 cells
were from the laboratory of M. Weller (Department of General Neurology,
University of Tübingen, Tübingen, Germany). All cell lines were described
previously (16).

Colony Survival Assay
Colony-forming assays were performed as previously described (17).
Briefly, U87MG (p53wt) and U138MG (p53mt) glioma cells growing in log
phase were used. Cells were seeded in triplicate at appropriate cell numbers
in 60-mm Petri dishes to yield f100 surviving colonies after ACNU or
BCNU treatment. Cells were allowed to attach and then exposed to
increasing concentrations of the drugs. After 2 weeks, colonies were fixed
(in acetic acid:methanol:H2O, 1:1:8), stained (in 0.01% Amido Black) and
counted (>100 cells/colony). The surviving fraction was plotted on a log
scale.

Drug Treatment
Approximately 10 5 cells were plated in 60-mm Petri dishes
24 h before treatment with different concentrations of ACNU or BCNU
(Sigma). Stocks were prepared by dissolving the drugs in sterile H2O,
filtered, and stored at 20jC. Temozolomide (Schering-Plough) was
dissolved in DMSO and diluted in distilled water. The p53 inhibitor
Pifithrin-a (Calbiochem), which reversibly blocks p53-dependent transcriptional activation (18), was added 1 h before ACNU treatment. The
percentage of the cells undergoing apoptosis was determined at 144 h.

Quantification of Apoptosis
Analysis by sub–G1-flow cytometry. After different times (indicated for
each experiment), both adherent and detached cells were collected and
centrifuged at 1,000 rpm for 5 min. Pelleted cells were fixed with 70%
ethanol and stored for up to 1 week at 20jC. Immediately before analysis,

www.aacrjournals.org

cells were treated with RNase (0.03 mg/mL) and subsequently stained with
propidium iodide (16.5 mg/mL) in PBS. Samples were then transferred to
microtubes, and propidium iodide fluorescence was measured by flow
cytometry (FACScalibur). For each sample, 10,000 cells were analyzed and
the results are shown as percentage of subdiploid nuclei (WinMDI
Software), which represent apoptotic cells.
Analysis by Annexin V/propidium iodide double staining. Approximately 105 cells were plated in 60-mm Petri dishes, and 144 h after
treatment with different concentrations of ACNU and BCNU, both adherent
and detached cells were collected and centrifuged at 1,000 rpm for 5 min.
After washing with PBS, cells were treated with binding buffer
(10 mmol/L HEPES, 140 mmol/L NaCl, 2.5 mmol/L CaCl2  2 H2O, and
0.1% bovine serum albumin). Cell suspension was then transferred to
microtubes where 2.5 AL of Annexin V-FITC (PharMingen) was added. After
incubation on ice, in the dark, for 15 min, 430 AL of binding buffer and
10 AL of propidium iodide (50 Ag/mL) were added. Samples were
immediately analyzed by flow cytometry. All experiments were repeated
at least thrice. Mean values F SD are shown, and data were compared
statistically using Student’s t test.

Quantification of DNA Synthesis
The Cell Proliferation ELISA bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) colorimetric
assay (Roche Applied Science) was performed according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, 1.0 to 5.0  104 cells were plated in a 96-well
microplate for 24 h before treatment with different concentrations of ACNU.
Different times after treatment, BrdUrd were added directly to the cell
medium for 2 h at 37jC in a humidified 7% CO2 atmosphere. Culture medium
was then removed, and cells were fixed and had their DNA denatured in a
one-step reaction by addition of FixDenat solution. Subsequently, samples
were incubated for 90 min with anti–BrdUrd-peroxidase solution. After
washing, the substrate was added for 20 min when photometric detection
was performed at 370 nm in an ELISA reader. Values are expressed in relation
to control samples that were considered as 100%.

Preparation of RNA and reverse transcription-PCR
Total RNA was isolated using the RNA II Isolation kit from MachereyNagel. Two micrograms of RNA were transcribed into cDNA by Superscript
II (Invitrogen Corporation) in a volume of 40 and 3 AL was subjected to
reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR). RT-PCR was performed using specific
primers (MWG Biotechnology) and Red-Taq Ready Mix (Sigma).

Preparation of Cell Extracts for Protein Analysis
Fractionated cell extracts. Cell pellets of treated and untreated samples
were suspended in fractionation buffer A [10 mmol/L HEPES-KOH (pH 7.4),
0.1 mmol/L EDTA, 1 mmol/L ethylene glycol-bis (b-aminoethyl ether),
250 mmol/L sucrose, 1 mmol/L Na3VO4, 0.5 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl
fluoride (PMSF), and 10 mmol/L DTT]. The cells were lysed by freeze/thaw/
vortexing. The lysate was then centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min, and the
supernatant containing the cytoplasmic proteins was isolated. The pellets,
containing the nuclei, organelles, and membranes, were then suspended in
fractionation buffer B [20 mmol/L Tris, 1 mmol/L EDTA, 1 mmol/L hmercaptoethanol, 5% glycerine, 1 mmol/L Na3VO4, 0.5 mmol/L PMSF, and
10 mmol/L DTT (pH 8.5)]. This suspension was homogenized by sonication.
After centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 10 min, the supernatant contains the
nuclear proteins and the pellet the membrane fragments. This membrane
pellet was suspended in fractionation buffer B containing 1% Triton X-100.
All protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford (19).

Western Blot Analysis
The method used here is based on the method described by Renart et al.
(20). Protein (30 mg) of cell extracts was separated in a 12% SDS
polyacrylamide gel. Thereafter, proteins were blotted onto a nitrocellulose
membrane (Protran; Schleicher & Schuell) for 3 h. Membranes were blocked
for 2 h at room temperature in 5% (w/v) fat-free milk powder in TBS
containing 0.1% Tween 20, incubated overnight at 4jC with the primary
antibody (1:500–1.000 dilution), washed thrice with 0.1% Tween 20 in
TBS, and incubated for 2 h with a horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody 1:3,000 (Amersham Biosciences AB). Antibodies used were

anti-Bax, anti-Bcl2, anti-extracellular signal-regulated kinase2 (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, Inc.), anti-p53 (Cell Signaling), and anti-Bak (Calbiochem).
After final washing with 0.1% Tween 20 in TBS (thrice for 10 min each),
blots were developed by using a chemiluminescence detection system
(Amersham Biosciences AB).

Caspase Activity
The caspase Colorimetric Assay (R&D Systems) was performed according
to the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, cells were treated with 50 Amol/L
ACNU, and after particular intervals of postexposure, they were trypsinized,
counted, and collected by centrifugation. Cell pellets were lysed on ice,
centrifuged, and the supernatant was transferred and kept on ice. The
enzymatic reactions were carried out in 96-well microplates (405 nm; 37jC;
1–2 h) with the addition of a equal volume of 2-x reaction buffer and
appropriate caspase colorimetric substrate before the measurement on an
ELISA reader.

Transfection of Glioma Cells with MGMT and DN-FADD
The transfection method for MGMT and DN-FADD in human glioma
cells has been described in our previous work (16). Briefly, MGMT
transfectants were generated by cotransfection of U87MG (p53wt) and
U138MG (p53mt) cells with the mammalian expression vector
(pSV2MGMT) harboring the MGMT gene described previously (7) and the
pSV2neo plasmid for selection. G418-resistant clones were picked in 24-well
plates and tested for MGMT expression using Western blot and MGMT
activity assay. DN-FADD transfectants were generated in U87MG (p53wt)
and U138MG (p53mt) cells by transfecting pcDNA3-FADD-DN (21) that
already contained the neo gene. FADD-DN–positive clones were determined
by Western blotting. Stably p53siRNA-transfected U87MG cells were
described before (16, 22).

Immunohistochemistry
U87MG (p53wt) and U138MG (p53mt) cells were seeded on coverslips.
Following treatment with 50 Amol/L ACNU and 72 h, the cells were fixed
with 4% formaldehyde. A second fixation step was performed using 100%
methanol ( 20jC; 20 min). Cells were then blocked in 5% BSA PBS (0.3%
Triton X-100). The antibodies used were anti–phosphorylated histone H2AX
(g-H2AX; Upstate) and Alexa Fluor 546 (Molecular Probes). Just before
mounting, DNA was stained with 100 nmol/L 4¶,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole
for 15 min. Between all steps, cells were washed in PBS (0.3% Triton X-100)
for 5 min thrice. Slides were mounted in antifade medium [Glycerol/PBS,
1:1; 2.5% DABCO (pH 8.6) with HCl].

Results
Cytotoxicity of ACNU and BCNU in p53wt and p53mt glioma
cells. First, we examined the cytotoxic effect of ACNU and BCNU in
U87MG (p53wt) and U138MG (p53mt) glioma cells in colony-

forming survival assays. As shown in Fig. 1, U138MG (p53mt)
cells are clearly more sensitive to the killing effect of both ACNU
(Fig. 1A) and BCNU (Fig. 1B), when compared with U87MG (p53wt)
cells. This is in marked contrast to their response to methylating
agents, such as N-methyl-N¶-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine, shown for
comparison in Fig. 1C, for which p53wt were more sensitive than
p53mt glioma cells (16).
ACNU and BCNU treatment induces both necrosis and
apoptosis in human glioma cells. Next, we compared the
apoptotic response of U87MG (p53wt) and U138MG (p53mt) cells
after exposure to ACNU and BCNU. Analysis of sub-G1 fraction of
exponentially growing cells at different times after treatment shows
that both ACNU (Fig. 2A) and BCNU (Fig. 2B) were effective in
inducing apoptosis in glioma cells. Apoptosis was a late response,
starting at f70 h and constantly increasing until 144 h from
treatment. Interestingly, during the entire posttreatment period,
U87MG (p53wt) cells displayed a lower level of apoptosis when
compared with p53-mutated cells. This was also observed in a
dose-response study after treatment with ACNU and BCNU (data
not shown).
To substantiate these results and, further, to discriminate
between apoptotic and necrotic cell death, the analysis was
performed by Annexin V/propidium iodide double-staining and
quantification by flow cytometry. Cells were harvested 144 h after
treatment with different concentrations of ACNU. Data shown in
Fig. 2C revealed that U87MG (p53wt) and U138MG (p53mt) cells
undergo apoptosis upon treatment and that p53wt cells are
more resistant than p53mt cells to ACNU (Fig. 2C). Surprisingly,
analysis of the necrotic fraction (Fig. 2D) showed that ACNU
induces a high level of necrotic cell death in U138MG (p53mt) cells,
whereas U87MG (p53wt) cells do not exhibit significant induction
of necrosis. This indicates that functional p53 protects not only
against apoptotic but also against necrotic cell death upon
chloroethylnitrosourea treatment. Similar results were obtained
with BCNU (data not shown). Taken together, the results show that
ACNU and BCNU induce both apoptosis and necrosis in human
glioma cells and that functional p53 causes resistance to these
agents.
Modulation of p53 affects ACNU-induced apoptosis. To
address the question of whether p53 becomes activated in response
to CNUs, the nuclear levels of p53 were investigated at different
times after ACNU treatment in U87MG (p53wt) and U138MG
(p53mt) cells. As shown in Fig. 3A, there is a clear stabilization of
nuclear p53 in U87MG (p53wt) cells, starting as soon as 24 h after

treatment. In U138MG (p53mt) cells, no p53 was observed in the
nuclear fraction. To delineate that p53 induction was in fact related
to the resistance of U87MG (p53wt) cells to ACNU, we treated
U87MG (p53wt) cells stably expressing siRNA targeted to p53
(U87sip53) with different concentrations of ACNU and compared
the results with U87MG (p53wt) cells transfected with an empty
vector (mock). The data shown in Fig. 3B show that knock-down
of p53 increases the sensitivity of cells toward ACNU. To further
substantiate this finding, pifithrin-a, a specific p53 inhibitor, was
added to the cell culture medium 1 h before ACNU treatment
(50 Amol/L) of U87MG (p53wt) and U138MG (p53mt) cells.
Figure 3C shows that inhibition of p53 by pifithrin-a increases
the cell death levels specifically in U87MG (p53wt) cells, although
having no effect in U138MG (p53mt) cells. To further confirm the
role of p53 in chloroethylnitrosourea-induced cell death, we used
another pair of glioma cells (Fig. 3D). Again, p53wt cells (the line
LN-229) were more resistant to ACNU than p53mt cells (LN-308).
Overall, the data supports the finding that p53 plays a protective
role against cell death (executed by apoptosis and necrosis) upon
treatment with chloroethylating agents.
MGMT protects both p53wt and p53mt glioma cells against
ACNU. Chloroethylating agents induce a broad spectrum of DNA
lesions; one of them is O 6-chloroethylguanine. MGMT is thought to
play the main role in defense by removing the chloroethyl group
from the O6-position of guanine, thereby preventing secondary
interstrand cross-link formation. To show that the killing effect of
ACNU in glioma cells is in fact due to O 6-chloroethylguanine, we
stably transfected U87MG (p53wt) and U138MG (p53mt) cells with

www.aacrjournals.org

MGMT. The transfectants exhibit MGMT protein (Fig. 4A) and
activity (data not shown), in contrast to the parental cell lines that
have no detectable MGMT. Figure 4A shows that the presence of
functional MGMT significantly protects against apoptosis induction
in both U87MG (p53wt) and U138MG (p53mt) cells. Because MGMT
specifically repairs O 6-chloroethylguanine adducts, the reduction of
apoptosis frequency almost back to control level found in MGMT
expressing cells strongly suggests that O 6-chloroethylguanine is in
fact the initial DNA damage that, upon conversion into secondary
lesions, triggers apoptosis after CNU treatment in glioma cells.
p53wt cells display better recovery from DNA replication
inhibition than p53mt cells after ACNU treatment. ACNU
induces the formation of interstrand cross-links in the DNA by
molecular rearrangement of the O 6-chloroethyl group. Because
interstrand cross-links are strong inhibitors of DNA replication, we
determined the DNA synthesis in U87MG (p53wt) and U138MG
(p53mt) cells at different times after treatment with ACNU. Using
the BrdUrd-incorporation method, we show that 12 h after
treatment DNA synthesis is blocked in both U87MG (p53wt) and
U138MG (p53mt) cells (Fig. 4B). It is evident, however, that U87MG
(p53wt) cells were able to recover 48 h after treatment to normal
levels of DNA synthesis, whereas in U138MG (p53mt) cells,
replication levels did not recover. This indicates that in U87MG
(p53wt) cells, replication progression was no longer inhibited by
replication blocking lesions, whereas in U138MG (p53mt) cells,
lesions that block replication were obviously still present. To
elucidate whether this replication inhibition was a consequence
of interstrand cross-link formation due to O 6-chloroethylguanine,

we analyzed the replication rates after ACNU treatment in MGMTtransfected glioma cells. Figure 4C shows the results for U87MGMT (p53wt) and U138-MGMT (p53mt) cells, respectively. It is
shown that in the presence of MGMT replication blockage does not
occur in both cell lines, except at the highest ACNU concentration
tested (200 Amol/L), which is very likely due to saturation of the
MGMT repair activity.
p53-mutated glioma cells display a higher level of DSBs
upon ACNU treatment. Although the repair of interstrand crosslinks in mammalian cells is poorly understood, there is strong
evidence supporting the formation of DSBs during lesion processing. g-H2AX has widely been used as a marker for DSBs. Therefore,
the levels of g-H2AX in these cells after ACNU treatment was
investigated. As shown in Fig. 5A, in U87MG (p53wt) cells g-H2AX
was induced up to 72 h from treatment, followed by a decrease
after 96 and 120 h. In contrast, in U138MG (p53mt) cells the level of
g-H2AX induction was clearly higher and continued to increase
steadily up to 120 h (Fig. 5A). g-H2AX induction after ACNU
treatment was also investigated by fluorescence microscopy. As
shown in Fig. 5B, clearly much higher amounts of g-H2AX foci were
observed in U138MG (p53mt) compared with U87MG (p53wt) cells
( for quantification see Fig. 5C). The data indicate that in U138MG
(p53mt) cells, more DSBs were produced from interstrand crosslink processing and left unrepaired, whereas in U87MG (p53wt)
cells, less DSBs were produced and/or were subject to repair. The
data are in line with the enhanced sensitivity of U138MG (p53mt)
cells to CNUs, compared with U87MG (p53wt) cells.
Expression of DNA repair genes in glioma cells after ACNU
treatment. The effect of ACNU treatment on the expression of

DNA repair genes was determined by quantitative RT-PCR. U87MG
(p53wt), U138MG (p53mt), U87sip53, and U87MGMT cells were
used for these experiments. Data shown in Fig. 5D revealed that
from all genes tested, enhanced expression was only observed for
xpc and ddb2 mRNA after ACNU treatment. Most interestingly, this
occurred only in U87MG (p53wt) but not in U138MG (p53mt)
glioma cells, which also displayed a very low basal ddb2 expression.
Xpc and ddb2 induction was clearly attenuated in U87sip53 cells,
supporting the role of p53 in the regulation of XPC and DDB2.
The induction of xpc and ddb2 was completely lacking in U87MG
(p53wt) cells stably transfected with MGMT cDNA (U87MGMT
cells), which shows that the induction of these DNA repair genes
originated from O 6-chloroethylguanine, or the processing of O 6chloroethylguanine DNA adducts. XPC and DDB2 are supposed
to be involved in interstrand cross-link repair. Therefore, the data
further support the hypothesis that p53mt glioma cells are
defective in the repair of interstrand cross-links derived from O 6chloroethylguanine, which provoke cell death.
ACNU activates both the extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis
pathway in glioma cells. Which pathway is involved in ACNUinduced apoptosis in glioma cells? This question was addressed by
investigating U87MG (p53wt) and U138MG (p53mt) cells that were
stably transfected with dominant-negative FADD (DN-FADD; the cell
lines were designated as U87DN-FADD and U138DN-FADD,
respectively), which are impaired in apoptosis signaling through
the extrinsic pathway (16). Although a f40% reduction of apoptosis
rate was observed in U87MG (p53wt) cells, there was no protective
effect in U138MG (p53mt) cells (Fig. 6A). This indicates that only in
p53wt cells, the extrinsic pathway plays a role in apoptosis induction

by ACNU. Further, after ACNU treatment, Bcl-2 in the mitochondrial
fraction becomes transiently up-regulated and subsequently degraded in both cell lines (Fig. 6B). Bax showed up-regulation after
ACNU treatment notably in U87MG (p53wt) cells, whereas Bak was
not affected in either cell lines (Fig. 6B). Because the activation of the
intrinsic pathway depends on the ratio between the antiapoptotic
Bcl-2 and the proapoptotic Bax and Bak, the data are taken to
indicate that the intrinsic pathway also becomes activated in glioma
cells after ACNU treatment. As expected from the response of DNFADD transfected cells, U87MG (p53wt) cells showed a clear
activation of caspase-8, whereas U138MG (p53mt) cells did not
(Fig. 6C). Both lines showed caspase-9 and caspase-3 activation, with
U138MG (p53mt) cells responding slightly better (Fig. 6C). The
activation of the effector caspase-7 was also determined in response
to ACNU (Fig. 6D). It occurred only in U138MG (p53mt) cells (at
times where the cells undergo apoptosis; see Fig. 2A), which is in line
with its higher ACNU sensitivity.

Discussion
Even after recent advances in therapy, patients suffering from
GBM (WHO grade IV) have a very poor prognosis. Treatment
consists of surgery followed by radiation and chemotherapy. The
most often used chemotherapeutic agents are methylating (such as

www.aacrjournals.org

temozolomide) and chloroethylating agents (such as ACNU, BCNU,
and CCNU). In our previous work, we studied the molecular action
of methylating agents in human malignant glioma cells (16). The
present work was aimed at elucidating the mechanism of cell death
induced by O 6-chloroethylating agents in the same glioma cell
system. As a first step toward this goal, we compared the effects of
ACNU and BCNU on a p53 wild-type and p53 mutant background.
This is important because p53 is often mutated in human gliomas.
Thus, secondary GBM that develop from grade II or III astrocytomas exhibit p53 mutations in 57%, whereas primary GBM
exhibit p53 mutations in 17% of cases (23). Furthermore, we
recently showed that p53 has a strong effect on sensitization of
glioma cells to methylating agents such as temozolomide, which is
in use for first-line therapy of GBM. The present work shows that
glioma cells undergo cell death after ACNU and BCNU treatment
by apoptosis. This is a quite late response, occurring no earlier than
3 to 4 days after treatment. Contrary to temozolomide, however,
p53 wt glioma cells were more resistant than p53-mutated or p53inactivated cells. Interestingly, our data also show that although
p53 wild-type glioma cells die exclusively by apoptosis, p53 mutant
cells treated with ACNU and BCNU exhibit high levels of necrosis
(on average 50% of the death fraction). This is unusual and has not
been observed for methylating agents, including temozolomide,
that almost exclusively induce apoptosis (16). The reason and

consequences of necrosis induction upon CNU administration will
be elucidated in detail in forthcoming studies.
Both colony forming experiments and the quantification of
apoptosis and necrosis revealed that p53 mutant glioma cells are

significantly more sensitive to ACNU and BCNU treatment than
p53 wild-type cells. The higher sensitivity of the colony assay allowed
for the use of lower doses. Clearly, p53 protects human glioma
cells against chloroethylating agents. This was confirmed by

pharmacologic inhibition of p53 by pifithrin-a and by downregulating p53 by siRNA transfection. The data obtained with
MGMT-transfected cells further show that the induction of O 6chloroethylguanine is the main signal that triggers apoptosis (and
necrosis) after CNU treatment because cells expressing this DNA
repair protein are protected against the toxic effects of the drug
independent of their p53 status. The data further support the role of

MGMT as a key node in the resistance of human glioma cells against
methylating and chloroethylating agents.
How is cell death executed in response to DNA adducts generated
by CNUs? It is well-established that O 6-chloroethylguanine lesions
become converted into interstrand cross-links (8, 10), which are
strong replication-blocking lesions (24). This was confirmed here as
ACNU treatment inhibited DNA synthesis in glioma cells. This was

completely abolished in MGMT-transfected cells, which shows that
O 6-chloroethylguanine or secondary lesions derived from them are
responsible for DNA replication inhibition. Moreover, whereas p53wt
cells recovered by returning back to normal DNA synthesis levels,
p53mt glioma cells did not show any recovery from DNA synthesis
blockage. This indicates that p53 wild-type cells are able to remove
the DNA blocking lesions from their genome, whereas p53 mutant
cells are impaired. The strong and sustained blockage of DNA
synthesis is related to a high cell killing response, which was also
shown for other experimental systems (25). The high sensitivity of
p53 mutant glioma cells to ACNU is consistent with the hypothesis
that critical lesions are not, or only incompletely, repaired or
erroneously processed if p53 is functionally lacking. It is conceivable
that nonrepaired interstrand cross-links originating from O 6chloroethylguanine adducts are converted during DNA replication
into DSBs that are considered to be a most critical downstream
apoptosis signal upon DNA base damage (26). In fact, we clearly
observed higher levels of H2AX phosphorylation in p53 mutant
glioma cells, which has been reported to be generated during
interstrand cross-link processing and indicative of the presence of
DSBs (27). The formation of DSBs after interstrand cross-link
induction is a possible consequence of stalled replication forks
during S phase (28). In line with this is the finding that replicationinhibited p53 mutant glioma cells are more resistant to apoptosis
induction by ACNU than proliferating cells.3 From the increased
level of DSBs in p53 mutant glioma cells along with their enhanced
sensitivity, it is pertinent to conclude that p53 wild-type glioma cells
are more efficient in the repair of CNU-induced interstrand crosslinks or DSBs generated from them than p53-mutated glioma cells.
The findings outlined above prompted us to elucidate the
expression of DNA repair genes in glioma cells upon ACNU
treatment. The obtained data revealed that the basal level of
expression of NER genes is nearly equal in p53 wild-type and
mutant cells. However, xpc and ddb2 were found to be upregulated after ACNU treatment, which only occurs in p53 wildtype and not p53 mutant cells. Interestingly, this up-regulation
seems to be long lasting because it was observed 24 h after
treatment. The long period necessary for up-regulation of these
genes could be explained by the time required for the formation of
interstrand cross-links after O 6-chloroethylguanine adducts, which
takes 8 to 12 h in mammalian cells (29). The up-regulation of xpc
and ddb2 via p53 is well described for UV-C irradiation (30–32). In
this report we show, for the first time, that xpc and ddb2 upregulation occurs in glioma cells after CNU treatment. Recently, it
has been shown that XPC is involved in the recognition of
psoralen-induced interstrand cross-links (33). Although we can
only speculate about the role of XPC and DDB2 in interstrand
cross-link repair generated by O 6-chloroethylguanine adducts, the
data support the view that p53 mutant glioma cells are defective in

3

the repair or processing of O 6-chloroethylguanine generated
secondary lesions, making them more sensitive to CNUs.
Another difference observed between p53 wild-type and p53
mutant glioma cells after ACNU treatment pertains to the
apoptotic pathways used by these cells. In p53 wild-type cells,
both the extrinsic (as shown by caspase-8 activation and protection
mediated by DN-FADD transfection) and the intrinsic (as shown by
Bcl-2 degradation, Bax up-regulation, and caspase-9 activation)
apoptotic pathways are activated. In p53 mutant cells, however,
only the intrinsic pathway (as shown by lack of caspase-8 activation
and effect of DN-FADD) seems to be involved in ACNU-triggered
apoptosis. This is in line with previous results obtained with
temozolomide, where p53 mutant cells undergo apoptosis mainly
through the intrinsic pathway. We should note that there was a
significant activation of caspase-7 in p53 mutant cells, which
conformed to their increased apoptotic response.
Collectively, the data presented here show for the first time that
p53 protects against the killing effects of the chloroethylating
anticancer drugs ACNU and BCNU in glioma cells. These data are
in striking contrast to our previous findings obtained with
methylating agents, including temozolomide, where it was shown
that p53 greatly stimulates their killing properties (15, 16).
Obviously, for temozolomide, p53 determines the switch between
receptor and mitochondrial apoptotic pathway, whereas for CNUs,
p53 determines the level of DNA repair. Although the mechanisms
involved need further exploration, the data have important
implications for glioma chemotherapy: (a) p53 seems to be a
predictive marker of therapy and, therefore, the p53 status of the
tumor tissue upon resection should be assessed; (b) it is
recommended that p53-mutated gliomas should be treated with
CNUs instead of temozolomide or other methylating drugs,
provided functional MGMT is not expressed, and (c) if the p53
status switches from p53 wild-type to p53 mutant during tumor
progression, the chemotherapeutic regime should switch from
methylating (temozolomide) to chloroethylating agents (ACNU,
BCNU, and CCNU) under MGMT-inactivated conditions. We are
aware that these are presently only theoretical considerations, as
the results were obtained under in vitro conditions in glioma cells.
The data might, however, be useful in further exploiting new
therapeutic avenues that will hopefully improve glioma therapy.
