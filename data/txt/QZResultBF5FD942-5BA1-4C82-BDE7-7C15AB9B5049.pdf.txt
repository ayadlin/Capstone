Abstract
VEGF pathway–targeting antiangiogenic drugs, such as bevacizumab, when combined with chemotherapy have changed
clinical practice for the treatment of a broad spectrum of human
cancers. However, adaptive resistance often develops, and one
major mechanism is elevated tumor hypoxia and upregulated
hypoxia-inducible factor-1a (HIF1a) caused by antiangiogenic
treatment. Reduced tumor vessel numbers and function following
antiangiogenic therapy may also affect intratumoral delivery of
concurrently administered chemotherapy. Nonetheless, combining chemotherapy and bevacizumab can lead to improved
response rates, progression-free survival, and sometimes, overall
survival, the extent of which can partly depend on the chemotherapy backbone. A rational, complementing chemotherapy
partner for combination with bevacizumab would not only
reduce HIF1a to overcome hypoxia-induced resistance, but also
improve tumor perfusion to maintain intratumoral drug delivery.
Here, we evaluated bevacizumab and CRLX101, an investigation-

al nanoparticle–drug conjugate containing camptothecin, in preclinical mouse models of orthotopic primary triple-negative
breast tumor xenografts, including a patient-derived xenograft.
We also evaluated long-term efﬁcacy of CRLX101 and bevacizumab to treat postsurgical, advanced metastatic breast cancer in
mice. CRLX101 alone and combined with bevacizumab was
highly efﬁcacious, leading to complete tumor regressions, reduced
metastasis, and greatly extended survival of mice with metastatic
disease. Moreover, CRLX101 led to improved tumor perfusion
and reduced hypoxia, as measured by contrast-enhanced ultrasound and photoacoustic imaging. CRLX101 durably suppressed
HIF1a, thus potentially counteracting undesirable effects of elevated tumor hypoxia caused by bevacizumab. Our preclinical
results show pairing a potent cytotoxic nanoparticle chemotherapeutic that complements and improves concurrent antiangiogenic therapy may be a promising treatment strategy for metastatic breast cancer. Cancer Res; 76(15); 4493–503. 2016 AACR.

Introduction

backbones showed less impressive beneﬁts in progression-free
survival (PFS; ref. 2). More recently, however, there has been
renewed interest in reconsidering bevacizumab for the treatment of breast cancer based on several phase III clinical trial
results, including one in the neoadjuvant and adjuvant setting
(NSABP-B40) and two in the maintenance metastatic setting
(IMELDA and TANIA; refs. 3–5). Importantly, a number of trial
results and meta-analyses suggest the extent of beneﬁcial effect
(and associated toxicities) of adding bevacizumab to chemotherapy may depend on the concurrent chemotherapy regimen
used (2, 4, 6, 7). Thus, an appropriate chemotherapy partner,
one with better efﬁcacy, manageable toxicity, and complementary modes of action, may be critical to gaining optimal beneﬁt
out of adding bevacizumab (and vice versa). One promising
investigational chemotherapy drug is a nanoparticle–drug conjugate (NDC) known as CRLX101, which contains the payload
camptothecin, a highly potent cytotoxic agent that inhibits
topoisomerase-I (8, 9).
Camptothecin showed impressive preclinical antitumor
activity but had low solubility, metabolic instability of the active
lactone form, rapid renal clearance, and severe toxicities, which
resulted in disappointing results in early-phase clinical trials
(10, 11). A number of analogues were thus developed
to improve the solubility of camptothecin, including the

Patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) have the
highest risk of recurrence and metastasis (1). Various targeted
therapies have been investigated, but as yet, none are currently
approved. One notable example is bevacizumab, a VEGF-targeting antibody, which was granted accelerated FDA approval
with weekly paclitaxel for ﬁrst-line treatment of metastatic
breast cancer, but this approval was later revoked after follow-up phase III clinical trials with different chemotherapy

subsequently approved drugs, topotecan (Hycamtin, GlaxoSmithKline) and irinotecan (Camptosar, Pﬁzer; refs. 9, 12).
Currently, there is no topoisomerase-I inhibitor approved for
breast cancer treatment. Although both irinotecan and topotecan have been evaluated in phase II trials for metastatic breast
cancer, they have not been approved as treatments for that
indication given the associated high-grade toxicities experienced
by patients for a modest beneﬁt gain (13–17). Nonetheless,
lessons learned from early trials using camptothecin (18), topotecan, and irinotecan suggest camptothecin analogues are
indeed active in the treatment of breast cancer, but further
clinical development requires better drug solubility, improved
lactone ring stabilization, and less systemic toxicity. Notably, a
recent phase III trial (BEACON) evaluated etirinotecan pegol, a
new formulation of irinotecan, in patients with recurrent or
metastatic breast cancer (19). It showed single-agent PFS beneﬁts similar to treatment of physician's choice. Moreover,
subgroup analyses showed etirinotecan pegol signiﬁcantly prolonged overall survival in patients with a history of brain or liver
metastases, and with two or more sites of disease (19). As an
NDC of camptothecin, CRLX101 was designed to have superior
solubility and stabilization of the lactone ring, as well as favorable safety and pharmacokinetics in patients (20, 21).
CRLX101 is composed of a cyclodextrin-containing polymer
conjugated to camptothecin. In mice, the cyclodextrin polymer
itself has no observable side effects or antitumor efﬁcacy when
tested up to 240 mg/kg (22). CRLX101 was designed to have
improved accumulation within tumors by the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect and thus reduced systemic
exposure and toxicity (8, 20). The drug has been administered
to more than 300 patients to date and appears to be generally
well tolerated, achieving an overall response rate of 16% in 19
patients in a phase II clinical trial of platinum-resistant ovarian
cancer as a monotherapy (23) and 23% in 22 patients in a
phase I/II study of metastatic renal cell carcinoma in combination with bevacizumab (21).
We recently reported that CRLX101 plus bevacizumab resulted
in synergistic antitumor efﬁcacy in a preclinical model of
advanced, metastatic ovarian cancer (23). CRLX101 was also
shown to effectively and durably suppress elevated hypoxiainduced upregulation of hypoxia-inducible factor-1a (HIF1a)
following therapy with bevacizumab, thus downregulating
expression of downstream HIF1a-regulated markers, such as
carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX; ref. 23), and blocking the induction
of cancer stem cells (24).
Here, we evaluated the combination of CRLX101 and bevacizumab in long-term therapy experiments of orthotopic primary TNBC xenografts either derived from tumor tissue fragment implantation of a patient-derived xenograft (PDX) called
HCI-002 (25, 26) or cell injection of LM2-4, a luciferase-tagged
variant of the established cell line MDA-MB-231 serially selected in vivo for aggressive spontaneous metastatic properties (27).
We also evaluated long-term efﬁcacy of CRLX101 and bevacizumab in a preclinical model of postsurgical, advanced metastatic TNBC (28), a model that recapitulates the more
challenging clinical treatment of systemic metastatic disease
(28, 29). We report that CRLX101 alone and in combination
with bevacizumab is an effective treatment for advanced metastatic TNBC in these mouse models and provide new mechanistic results to help explain this encouraging antitumor
activity.

Materials and Methods
Cell line and patient-derived tumor fragments
MDA-MB-231/LM2-4luc16þ (LM2-4) is a highly aggressive
variant of MDA-MB-231 [parental line obtained from Jeff Lemontt (Genzyme Corp., Boston, MA) in 2000] and maintained in
RPMI1640 supplemented with 5% FBS (27). LM2-4 was last
authenticated in 2013 by Genetica DNA Laboratories (a LabCorp
Specialty Testing Group) using analytical procedures for DNA
extraction, PCR, and capillary electrophoresis on a 3130xl Genetic
Analyzer (Applied Biosystems). The 13 core CODIS short tandem
repeat (STR) loci plus PENTA E and PENTA D, and the genderdetermining locus, amelogenin, were analyzed using the commercially available PowerPlex 16 HS Ampliﬁcation Kit (Promega
Corporation) and GeneMapper ID v3.2.1 software (Applied Biosystems) with appropriate positive and negative controls. Authentication of cell lines is conﬁrmed by entering the STR DNA proﬁle
of each tested cell line into known repository cell line databases;
authentication is deﬁned as having a percent match with the
reference STR proﬁle 80% when using the ANSI/ATCC guidelines (ASN-0002-2011) or having a "unique" STR DNA proﬁle (no
matches found) for "in-house" cell lines not distributed by any
cell line repository.
PDX HCI-002 tumor fragments were generously provided by
Dr. Alana Welm (University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT). Tumor
fragments were originally obtained from a patient with TNBC and
veriﬁed by histology to have retained morphology and characteristics as matched patient samples (25, 26). HCI-002 tumor fragments were serially passaged in SCID mice, and only early
passages were used for all experiments.
Primary tumor implantation into the mammary fat pad
Eight-week-old female YFP-SCID mice were bred in-house.
Procedures involving animals and their care were conducted in
strict conformity with the guidelines of Sunnybrook Health
Science Centre (Toronto, Ontario, Canada) and the Canadian
Council of Animal Care. Mammary fat pad injections of LM2-4
(5  105 cells) and tumor fragment implantations (pieces of 2–5
mm3) of HCI-002 were carried out as described previously (26,
27). Mice were randomized by tumor volume prior to treatment
initiation. All doses of CRLX101 are reported as camptothecinequivalent doses.
Contrast-enhanced ultrasound photoacoustic imaging
In vivo imaging of primary tumors was conducted using a
commercially available high-frequency laser-integrated ultrasound system (VevoLAZR, VisualSonics), which allowed for both
photoacoustic and contrast-enhanced imaging (30). Contrast
data were quantiﬁed with VevoCQ using time intensity curves
(TIC) generated from the wash-in of microbubbles. Two parameters are taken from the TIC: peak enhancement and wash-in
rate. Dual-wavelength PA imaging was used for real-time monitoring and calculation of oxygen saturation with the VevoLAB
software.
Postsurgical, advanced metastatic breast cancer therapy model
LM2-4 cells were orthotopically implanted into the right mammary fat pad and resected when tumors reached 400 to 500 mm3,
as described in ref. 27. Following primary tumor resection, distant
visceral metastases can be detected by total body bioluminescence
imaging using an IVIS200 Xenogen. Mice with metastatic disease

Bevacizumab with CRLX101 to Treat Metastatic TNBC

were randomized on the basis of metastatic load and location
before therapies were initiated (27, 29).
Statistical analysis
Results were reported as mean  SD or SEM, as indicated.
Tumor growth curves were reported as mean  SD. Survival curves
were plotted by the method of Kaplan and Meier and tested for
survival differences with the log-rank test. Statistical signiﬁcance
was assessed by one-way ANOVA (Kruskal–Wallis test with Dunn
post hoc) or t test (Mann–Whitney, two-tailed) using GraphPad
Prism 4 (P < 0.05 was used as the threshold of statistical
signiﬁcance).

Results
CRLX101 treatment can lead to complete primary tumor
regressions
The MTD (8 mg/kg i.p. once weekly) of CRLX101 was previously established for SCID mice and is well tolerated even when
combined with bevacizumab for long-term studies (23). In a
primary tumor model derived from cell injection of LM2-4,
CRLX101 caused rapid and durable tumor regressions (Fig. 1).
Lower doses of CRLX101 monotherapy resulted in slower rates of
tumor shrinkage compared with 8 mg/kg, resulting in small
tumors that still eventually caused hind leg mobility impairment
(smaller tumor volumes compared with vehicle but not statistically signiﬁcant). Although the addition of bevacizumab to 2 mg/
kg CRLX101 showed a trend for tumor growth delay, this was not
statistically signiﬁcant compared with 2 mg/kg CRLX101 monotherapy. Nonetheless, the addition of bevacizumab to 4 mg/kg
CRLX101 signiﬁcantly improved antitumor efﬁcacy (P < 0.05
compared with 4 mg/kg CRLX101 alone), showing improved
tumor growth suppression and shrinkage despite bevacizumab
alone having no antitumor efﬁcacy. However, despite early tumor
suppression and continued therapy, bioluminescence imaging of
mice treated with CRLX101 4 mg/kg plus bevacizumab showed
these tumors eventually continued to grow. Notably, while mice
were on-therapy continuously for 6 months, 8 mg/kg CRLX101
quickly and dramatically shrank established primary tumors,
resulting in complete regressions (P < 0.001), with 3 of 5 mice
essentially cured by 6 months of therapy (no observable bioluminescence signals). Similarly, 8 mg/kg CRLX101 plus bevacizumab also led to complete primary tumor regressions (P < 0.001
compared with vehicle, no statistically signiﬁcant difference compared with 8 mg/kg CRLX101 monotherapy). Four of 5 mice
treated with 8 mg/kg CRLX101 and bevacizumab did not have any
residual disease or regrowth even after being off-therapy for an
additional 4 months (Supplementary Fig. S1).
Compared with primary tumors derived from LM2-4, PDX
HCI-002 tumors were highly vascular. In contrast to bevacizumab's absence of efﬁcacy when treating LM2-4 primary tumors,
bevacizumab led to signiﬁcantly delayed HCI-002 tumor growth
while mice were on-therapy continuously for 5 months (P < 0.05
compared with vehicle; Fig. 2). Nonetheless, both doses of
CRLX101 durably suppressed tumor growth (P ¼ 0.002 for 4
mg/kg and P < 0.001 for 8 mg/kg CRLX101). Notably, the
combination of either dose with bevacizumab signiﬁcantly
improved the antitumor efﬁcacy compared with either drug alone
(P < 0.001 compared with monotherapy). In this PDX model,
despite tumor growth suppression or regression while mice were
on-therapy, when all therapies were stopped after 5 months,

tumor regrowth did occur but was delayed longer if mice were
originally treated with a higher dose of CRLX101 or with concurrent bevacizumab.
In separate experiments, tumors from mice treated for two
weeks were evaluated for changes in microvessel density (MVD)
and any corresponding changes in HIF1a (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Figs. S2 and S3). Bevacizumab reduced the number of
tumor vessels by approximately 50% in LM2-4 tumors (Fig. 3A)
and approximately 65% in HCI-002 tumors (Supplementary
Fig. S2). This reduced MVD by bevacizumab monotherapy
corresponded to an increase in HIF1a protein levels (Fig.
3B), which was conﬁrmed by similar trends observed using
immunohistochemical staining of HIF1a and CAIX, a downstream marker of HIF1a activity (Fig. 3C and D; ref. 23). In vitro,
higher doses of CRLX101 showed a trend (although not statistically signiﬁcant) of decreasing VEGF levels (Supplementary
Fig. S3). However, in vivo, CRLX101 monotherapies did not
signiﬁcantly decrease MVD even though CRLX101 maintained
low levels of HIF1a protein levels. Although CRLX101 monotherapies did not change the extent of tumor cell proliferation
(Fig. 3E), there was a signiﬁcant increase in apoptosis at all
doses administered (Fig. 3F). Tumors from mice treated with
concurrent bevacizumab and CRLX101 showed decreased MVD
to levels similar to bevacizumab monotherapy. Nonetheless,
concurrent CRLX101 was able to suppress any bevacizumabinduced increases in HIF1a. The reduced MVD observed for
combination-treated tumors did not affect tumoral accumulation of CRLX101 (Supplementary Fig. S2). Interestingly, concurrent bevacizumab did not further increase the extent of
apoptosis observed compared with CRLX101 monotherapies.
We next evaluated whether the reduction in MVD by bevacizumab correlated with a change in functional tumor perfusion using in vivo contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) imaging, which uses gas-ﬁlled microbubbles to noninvasively monitor changes in blood ﬂow and volume within tumors following therapy (Fig. 4; ref. 30). Tumors from mice treated with
vehicle or bevacizumab alone showed decreased tumor blood
volume and ﬂow rate over the course of two weeks of therapy.
In contrast, tumors from mice treated with CRLX101 monotherapy showed greatly improved perfusion, whereas perfusion
in tumors treated with the combination remained unchanged.
Parametric maps showing regions of high, low, or no perfusion
conﬁrm that tumors from mice treated with CRLX101 had
smaller necrotic cores compared with vehicle and bevacizumab
treatment. In the combination group, while a less perfused core
was present, the surrounding "viable rim" remained well perfused. Similarly, CEUS imaging of PDX tumors showed
CRLX101 maintained higher tumor perfusion and reduced
tumor hypoxia, also conﬁrmed by pimonidazole staining (Supplementary Fig. S4).
In addition to measuring perfusion using CEUS, photoacoustic
imaging was used to measure oxygen saturation (Fig. 4; ref. 30).
Short laser pulses are directed at the tumor, generating thermoelastic expansion to create acoustic waves detected by an ultrasound transducer. Different absorption spectra of deoxygenated
and oxygenated hemoglobin are then used to noninvasively
estimate the spatial distribution of oxygen saturation in vivo
(30). Consistent with CEUS data showing improved perfusion
in CRLX101-treated tumors, these tumors had relatively higher
tissue oxygenation levels compared with vehicle- and bevacizumab-treated tumors (Fig. 4C).

Improved perfusion with CRLX101 treatment suggests a
more functional tumor vasculature, as results from Fig. 3A
show CRLX101 does not result in an increase in the number
of vessels. Tumor cells rapidly growing within a conﬁned space
causes compression (or "solid stress") of tumoral blood vessels
(31, 32). One possible explanation for the overall improved
perfusion following CRLX101 is the drug causes extensive
tumor cell apoptosis, which may then relieve compression of
tumor blood vessels. To assess whether this may be the case, we
evaluated whether CRLX101 resulted in more vessels with an
open lumen, which would allow better blood ﬂow within the
tumor (Fig. 4D). Indeed, we observed that CRLX101 monotherapy resulted in a higher proportion of tumor blood vessels
with open lumen compared with both vehicle and bevacizumab treatment. It is worth noting that in tumors treated with
the drug combination, overall number of tumor vessels was
reduced, but more of the remaining vessels had open lumens.
These results were similarly conﬁrmed in PDX tumors (Supplementary Fig. S5).
To obtain conﬁrmation that CRLX101 relieves compression
of tumor blood vessels by killing tumor cells, we evaluated
whether tumor cell-packing density, that is, the number of cells
found within a given area, changed following therapy (Fig.
5A). Although the average number of cells present within an
imaged ﬁeld was similar between vehicle- and bevacizumab-

www.aacrjournals.org

treated tumors, all doses of CRLX101 caused a signiﬁcant
reduction in cell-packing density. Fewer tumor cells densely
packed within a tumor thus may result in fewer compressed
tumor blood vessels and hence improved perfusion and
oxygenation.
Paradoxically, a more functional vasculature could result in a
higher degree of tumor cell dissemination and metastasis to
distant organs, such as the lungs. We therefore analyzed lungs
from mice still bearing primary tumors for the presence of
micrometastases or tumor cells that previously shed from the
primary tumor and seeded in the lungs (Fig. 5B). Mice treated with
bevacizumab monotherapy showed more micrometastases that
were also larger in cluster size than those present in vehicle-treated
mice. This is consistent with some previous preclinical reports that
antiangiogenic agents used as monotherapies may cause an
increase in metastasis and promote disease progression in mice
despite an initial antitumor effect (33, 34). In stark contrast, mice
treated with CRLX101 (particularly at higher doses) either showed
no micrometastases or only singly dispersed tumor cells within
the lungs, even when combined with bevacizumab. CRLX101 was
therefore able to counteract potential prometastatic effects of
bevacizumab. This effect is similar to published data where
paclitaxel counteracted the proinvasive and prometastatic effects
of DC101, the VEGFR-2 antibody (20), and metronomic topotecan reduced metastatic spread elicited by sunitinib (35).

CRLX101 in a postsurgical metastatic breast cancer model
shrinks existing metastases and prevents the emergence of new
metastases
Given the potency of CRLX101 in both primary tumor models
and evidence showing CRLX101 was able to prevent formation of
micrometastases, CRLX101 alone and with bevacizumab were
evaluated in a postsurgical model of advanced metastatic breast
cancer. Following surgical resection of established primary LM2-4
tumors, distant metastases were allowed to develop before treatment was initiated. Metastases were monitored by bioluminescence imaging and can manifest as lymph node metastases
(causing mobility issues), lung metastases (leading to labored
breathing), primary tumor regrowth or local metastases at the
surgical site, as well as liver metastases and ascites (causing
distended abdomens). Given the inherent variability of when
and where metastases appear, every treatment group had randomized cohorts of mice with apparent distant metastases, local
metastases or regrowths, as well as mice with no signs of metastases at the start of therapy (Fig. 6). Within 1.5 months of therapy,
all mice treated with vehicle and bevacizumab monotherapy
succumbed to disease, even if no apparent metastases were
observed at the start of treatment. In contrast, bioluminescence
imaging showed that in mice that had apparent metastases at the
start of therapy, treatment with CRLX101 or CRLX101 plus
bevacizumab caused these existing metastases to regress. In mice
with no apparent metastases at the start of treatment, CRLX101
alone or combined with bevacizumab was able to prevent the
emergence of new metastases both while mice were on-therapy
(for 7 months) and then off-therapy (for 2 months). It should be
noted, however, that if mice had a very heavy metastatic load in
the lungs or ascites at the start of therapy, CRLX101 therapy was
not as effective; we hypothesize this may be due to the need for

4500 Cancer Res; 76(15) August 1, 2016

some initial time for CRLX101 to accumulate within tumor cells
and release its drug payload.
CRLX101 thus signiﬁcantly extended the survival of mice
with metastatic disease (Fig. 6B). Although mice treated with
vehicle or bevacizumab succumbed to metastases after 4 to 6
weeks, survival of mice treated with 4 mg/kg CRLX101 monotherapy was extended to 15 weeks. CRLX101 at 4 mg/kg plus
bevacizumab was effective at durably suppressing metastasis.
Notably, MTD CRLX101 was highly efﬁcacious, so much so that
any added beneﬁt of combining it with bevacizumab was not
detected. Upon necropsy, 3 of 9 mice (treated with 4 mg/kg
CRLX101 plus bevacizumab), 5 of 8 mice (treated with 8 mg/kg
CRLX101 alone), and 6 of 9 mice (treated with 8 mg/kg
CRLX101 plus bevacizumab) were still alive and free of macroscopic metastases at the end of the experiment (7 months ontherapy and 2 months off-therapy).

Discussion
We recently reported metronomic topotecan plus pazopanib
delayed tumor growth of primary TNBC tumors and prolonged
survival of mice with advanced metastatic disease (36). Given this
promising therapy of combining a topoisomerase-I inhibitor
(topotecan) and an antiangiogenic drug (pazopanib) for treating
TNBC in mice, here, we evaluated CRLX101 and bevacizumab.
There are several reasons why this alternative drug combination
may be superior to that of topotecan and pazopanib. Single-agent
topotecan had no antitumor efﬁcacy and resulted in increased
HIF1a. In contrast, single-agent CRLX101 is potently effective in
not only delaying tumor growth, but causing marked and sustained tumor regressions. Furthermore, CRLX101 whether alone
or combined with bevacizumab durably suppressed HIF1a.

Finally, one important concern of combining topotecan and
pazopanib is the tolerability and toxicity of both drugs, especially
the combination, in the clinic (13, 14, 37). In contrast, current
clinical data suggest that CRLX101 is tolerable in combination
with standard doses of bevacizumab in patients (38, 39). The
combination of CRLX101 and bevacizumab would thus appear to
be more promising considering its lesser toxicity and better
preclinical efﬁcacy, an improved therapeutic index compared
with the pazopanib/topotecan combination.
Limited efﬁcacy successes of approved VEGF pathway–targeting antiangiogenic drugs may be due to several possible factors,
including reduced intratumoral delivery of concurrently administered drugs, such as chemotherapy, as well as elevated hypoxia
(and hence HIF1a), which contributes to resistance and may
promote metastases (24, 40–42). Given these considerations, a
complementary chemotherapy partner for combination with an
antiangiogenic agent would be a highly potent agent that is able to
improve tumor perfusion and reduce HIF1a without increasing
tumor dissemination and/or metastases. Here, we showed that
CRLX101 may be such a drug.
A number of strategies have been proposed, including vessel
normalization (43) and "vascular promotion" therapy (31, 44),
to improve intratumoral chemotherapy drug delivery. Alternatively, impaired perfusion, whether caused by antiangiogenic
therapy or due to mechanical factors, such as tumor cells com-

www.aacrjournals.org

pressing vessels (31, 32), would be expected to reduce intratumoral delivery of chemotherapy drugs, such as CRLX101, in solid
tumors (8, 45). However, CRLX101 maintained tumor perfusion
despite concurrent antiangiogenic therapy. We report here that the
potent antitumor activity of CRLX101 alleviated the solid stress by
rapidly targeting tumor cells, in effect leading to major tumor
regressions and decompressing tumor blood vessels to improve
tumor perfusion ["tumor priming" (46)]. We and others have
reported that metronomic dosing of a gemcitabine prodrug
resulted in increased perfusion (47, 48). Paclitaxel-loaded
tumor-penetrating microparticles have also been used to enhance
siRNA delivery into solid tumors (46). Clinically, a similar effect
was observed, where weekly paclitaxel reduced interstitial ﬂuid
pressure and improved tumor oxygenation (49). Interestingly,
results from these studies and our work here with CRLX101
suggest chronic exposure of tumor cells to a cytotoxic drug, either
by administering chemotherapy drugs in a frequent, metronomic
fashion, or using drug formulations with intrinsically long halflives, such as CRLX101, may be required to maintain sufﬁcient
durable tumor cell kill to persistently reduce compression of
tumoral vessels and thus potentially improve perfusion. This
improvement in tumor perfusion signiﬁcantly reduces tumor
hypoxia, which contributes to the ability of CRLX101 to effectively and durably suppress HIF1a. Even though HIF1a is elevated
by tumor hypoxia, reduction in tumor hypoxia by improving

tumor perfusion alone may not completely account for the HIF1a
suppression by CRLX101. Rapisarda and colleagues have shown
in vitro that metronomic topotecan was able to suppress HIF1a
protein accumulation even when cells were maintained in normoxic conditions (50), suggesting HIF1a inhibition may occur
even in the absence of elevated hypoxia. Taken together, we have
shown that CRLX101 maintains or improves tumor perfusion and
is able to durably suppress HIF1a protein levels even in the
presence of bevacizumab, where tumors are more hypoxic, thus
making CRLX101 an effective chemotherapy partner to pair with
an antiangiogenic agent, such as bevacizumab.
One limitation of our results is the use of two primary tumor
models and one metastatic model. Nevertheless, given our preclinical results of CRLX101 showing potent antitumor activity,
particularly when treating advanced metastatic TNBC, and its
complementary mode of action for combining with bevacizumab, CRLX101 plus bevacizumab may be a promising treatment
strategy for breast cancer and other solid tumors.
