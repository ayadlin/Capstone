BACKGROUND. Recommendations for pretreatment evaluation and treatment of
cervical cancer have significantly evolved over the last decade because of the
results of multiple randomized studies comparing the addition of platin-based
chemoradiation as well as the widespread dissemination and use of imaging
modalities. This analysis was initiated to determine any systemic changes in
management of cervical cancers.
METHODS. Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program data were used
to sample newly diagnosed women in 1997, 2000, and 2001 with cancer of the
cervix. A total of 3116 women with no previous diagnosis of cancer were selected.
Data were reabstracted, additional information not routinely collected was
obtained, therapy was verified with the treating physician, and multiple endpoints were analyzed.

RESULTS. A marked rise was observed in the percentage receiving chemotherapy
(34% to 85%) as well as concurrent chemoradiation (20% to 72%) from 1997 to
2001.

CONCLUSIONS. The significant change in the management and treatment of cervical cancer appears to correspond temporally with the publication of 5 clinical
trials, all of which showed a significant improvement in overall survival associated with chemoradiation. This change also corresponded with the NCI Clinical
Announcement that was disseminated in 1999 to those oncologists most likely to
treat women with cervical cancer. Cancer 2008;113:743–9.  2008 American

century ago, cervical cancer was the leading cause of cancer
death among women in the United States (US). The age-adjusted
incidence rate and mortality rate of invasive cervical cancer has been
cut by half in just the past 20 years.1 This has been due in large part
to effective screening with Pap smears and effective treatment of precursor lesions to invasive cervical cancer, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, grade 3/cervical carcinoma in situ (CIN3/CIS). Cervical cancer,
therefore, has become relatively uncommon in the US. For the period
2000 through 2004, the average annual incidence and mortality rates
for cervical cancer in the US were 8.7 of 100,000 and 2.6 of 100,000,
respectively. However, the mortality rate for black women (4.9 of
100,000) was more than double that for non-Hispanic white women
(2.2 of 100,000), and the overall survival rates were lower for each age
group and stage in black women.
In addition to effective screening and treatment of precursor
lesions, another potential explanation for the reduction in cervical
cancer mortality may be the improvement in therapeutic interventions. In this regard, the mainstays of treatment for cervical cancer,

namely hysterectomy and radiation therapy, were
introduced more than a century ago. These definitive
management strategies have been expanded to
include new ways of evaluating lymph node metastasis, such as computed tomography (CT), magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI), and laparoscopic lymph
node dissection, as well as less radical surgery for
early-stage disease, and platinum-based chemoradiation. On the basis of 5 randomized phase III trials,2-6
the National Cancer Institute (NCI) issued a Clinical
Announcement in 1999,7 recommending that women
who require radiation for the treatment of cervical
cancer and their physicians consider the use of platinum-based chemoradiation. Thus, it seems logical to
suggest that these recommendations would alter the
practice of physicians and their decisions in regard to
the definitive management of women with cervical
cancer. This has not been examined in a populationbased sample of patients treated in community settings in the US. To address the extent of this change in
therapy, we undertook a population-based study evaluating patterns of care for women with cervical cancer,
including data on how widely the use of chemoradiation has spread into community practice in the US.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)
is a population-based program of registries that
assembles data on all individuals diagnosed with
cancer within defined geographic regions of the US.8
Each registry routinely collects data on tumor characteristics, demographics, and treatment and conducts follow-up of registered patients. These data are
primarily collected from hospitals, surgical centers,
and radiation facilities. However, much of the adjuvant therapy is provided in outpatient settings, and
this information is not systemically collected during
routine registration activities. To address this issue,
the NCI annually conducts studies to supplement the
treatment information initially collected by SEER.
In this study, staff at each participating SEER
registry selected a sample of women who were newly
diagnosed with histologically confirmed invasive cervical cancer in 1997, 2000, and 2001. For each diagnosis year, women aged 20 years at diagnosis were
chosen at random within racial/ethnic groups. The
SEER registries during 1997 and 2000 covered
approximately 14% of the population in the US, and
this increased to nearly 26% in 2001, by which time
several new registries had joined SEER. During 1997,
the metropolitan areas of Atlanta, Detroit, Los
Angeles, San Francisco, San Jose, and Seattle and the
states of New Mexico, Iowa, and Connecticut partici-

pated. In 2000, Utah and Hawaii also participated
and in 2001, the states of New Jersey and Louisiana
and the remainder of California joined. A total of
973, 773, and 1370 women with invasive cervical
cancer were selected in 1997, 2000, and 2001, respectively. In 1997, non-Hispanic black and Hispanic
women were oversampled. In 2000 and 2001, nonHispanic black, Hispanic, Asian/Pacific Islanders, and
American Indians/Alaskan Natives were oversampled.
A case was not eligible if: 1) she had been diagnosed
at autopsy; 2) the only evidence of her disease was
based on a death certificate; 3) the cancer was not
her first primary cancer (other than nonmelanoma
skin cancer); or 4) she was simultaneously diagnosed
with a second cancer, defined as within 2 months.
To ensure consistency and comparability of
abstracting and coding, a centralized training of the
primary medical records abstractor assigned to the
study from each registry was conducted. Data from
patient medical records were reabstracted to verify
information on patient demographics, tumor characteristics, any treatment planned, given, or refused,
and insurance status at the time of diagnosis. Each
patient’s physician was contacted to verify treatment
received or offered but refused by a patient. Followup for vital status is available through December
2004. Hospital bed size was collected, as was whether
there was an approved residency training program at
the facility where each patient received her most definitive treatment. Less than 1.5% of patients were
treated at hospitals with an unknown residency
training program; these were included in the category of no approved program. In addition, age, race/
ethnicity, insurance, International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage, grade, nodal
status, receipt of treatments, year of diagnosis, and
survival were examined. Women were grouped by insurance status: uninsured; private; any Medicaid;
Medicare only; other and unknown insurance. Information on each patient’s comorbid conditions at the
time of diagnosis was recorded from the hospital
medical records. A single Registered Health Information Technologist coded these comorbidities centrally, and the Charlson comorbidity score was
calculated from this information.9
All data analyses were performed using SUDAAN
(Research Triangle Institute, Research Triangle Park,
NC) and were weighted to reflect the population registered in SEER from which the data were obtained.
Multivariate analyses were conducted to assess the
association between each independent variable and
the receipt of therapy. The observed and adjusted
percentages of patients receiving each treatment
regimen are presented, as well as the odds ratios.

Treatment for Women with Cervical Cancer/Trimble et al

All-cause and cause-specific mortality were analyzed
using Cox regression models based on a maximum
follow-up of 7 years and a minimum follow-up of
2 years. On the basis of cause of death, we examined
mortality from all causes and death from cervical
cancer. All P values were 2-sided, and the test results
were considered to be statistically significant if their
associated P values were less than .05.

RESULTS
Distributions of selected characteristics for year of
diagnosis are shown (Table 1). The majority of
women were younger than 55 years of age at the
time of diagnosis. No significant differences were
observed in age distribution in the 3 years studied.
FIGO stage was observed to increase with advancing
age at diagnosis (data not shown). There was a slight
increase in FIGO stage IA1, with a decrease in the
percentage of women with stage IA2 and stage I not
otherwise specified. There was also a decrease in the
percentage of women who were unstaged, but a
slight increase in the percentage that were stage II
through IVA.
The use of diagnostic exams and tests varied
both by stage and by year of diagnosis (Table 2).
About 45% to 50% of all patients with a known stage
at diagnosis underwent an exam under anesthesia.
This increased as a function of stage, with more
women with stage II to IVA undergoing exams than
women with FIGO I or IVB. Women who were
unstaged were much less likely to have an exam
under anesthesia. The most common imaging modality was CT, while MRI and ultrasound were used
less frequently. The use of CT imaging was much
lower in women with FIGO stage I than women with
later-stage disease.
The treatment management differed substantially
in women with FIGO stage I as compared with those
with FIGO II-IVA disease (Table 3). Approximately
40% of women with FIGO stage I disease underwent
a modified radical hysterectomy, while roughly 30%
of women underwent total hysterectomy, and 15%
local destruction. In 2001, less than 20% of women
with stage II-IVA disease underwent hysterectomy.
Between 1997 and 2001, the use of both external
beam (EBRT) and intracavitary radiation therapy
(ICRT) increased (Table 3). For stage II to IVA, EBRT
increased from 85% to 94%, and ICRT increased from
56% to 72% in the 4-year period from 1997 to 2001.
This represents a marked change in the treatment
management pattern for women with intermediate
and locally advanced cervical malignancies.

There was a substantial increase in the use of
chemotherapy in all stages between 1997 and 2001;
this appears to be predominantly because of the use
of combined chemoradiation (Table 3). For example,
among women with stage II to IVA disease, the use
of chemoradiation rose from 20% in 1997 to 72 % in
2001, as did the overall use of chemotherapy, which
increased from 34% to 85% over the same time

frame. A similar increase in both chemoradiation
(28% to 59%) and chemotherapy (45% to 72%) was
observed in women with stage IVB disease (Table 3).
Finally, in the models that examined the use of
chemoradiation and the combination of chemotherapy, ICRT, and EBRT, use decreased with increasing
age of the women (Table 4). Chemoradiation and the
combination therapies increased with stage of disease and tumor grade. There was a significant
increase in the use of concurrent chemoradiation
between 1997 and 2000 and a significant increase in
the use of combination chemotherapy, ICRT, and
EBRT between 1997 and 2000, with a continued

increase into 2001. There was no statistically significant association between either of these 2 treatment
combinations and race/ethnicity or insurance status.
We examined the risk of death adjusting for age,
race/ethnicity, insurance status, FIGO stage, grade,
nodal status, treatment, and year of diagnosis (Table 5).
Each variable, except for year of diagnosis, was associated with the risk of death for all causes. The risk
of all-cause mortality increased with age, stage, and
grade, and was higher in women who had positive or
unknown nodes and women who received no therapy. All-cause mortality was lower in Hispanic
women than in non-Hispanic white women. How-

ever, only tumor-related characteristics and treatment were associated with risk of death from cervical
cancer. The risk of cervical cancer death increased
with stage and grade, and was higher for women
whose nodes were unknown or not examined.

DISCUSSION
Our analysis of the NCI patterns of care data during
the period 1997-2001 demonstrated several interesting trends over this relatively short time frame. The
most dramatic observation was the significant rise in
the percentage of women receiving both chemother-

747

apy (34% to 85%) and chemoradiation (20% to 72%)
for stage II to IVA disease from 1997 to 2001.
The most likely explanation for the change in
therapy is the publication of 3 of the 5 clinical trials
in the New England Journal of Medicine in 1999,2-4
timed with the NCI-issued Clinical Announcement.7
Shortly thereafter, the fourth and fifth trials were
published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology.5,6 With
the help of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, the American Society for Therapeutic Radiation
Oncology, and the Society of Gynecologic Oncologists, the NCI Clinical Announcement was disseminated to those oncologists most likely to treat
women with cervical cancer. A recently published
population-based study reported by Barbera et al
from the province of Ontario found a temporal
impact of the NCI Clinical Announcement in Canada.10 In the Canadian study, the increase in the use
of chemotherapy and radiation increased from <10%
before the NCI Clinical Announcement to >67% in
the period April 1999 through March 2001, after the
announcement. This change was also reported in the
patterns of care study by Eifel et al, where the use of
chemoradiation for women with locally advanced
disease rose from 19% in 1996 to 63% in 1999.11 The
increase in chemotherapy was not seen before 1999.
The NCI Clinical Announcement was issued February
22, 1999. The reports by Eifel et al and Barbera et al
suggest that these clinicians responded rapidly.
It is disturbing that only 70% of patients diagnosed with stage II to IVA disease received brachytherapy/ICRT as part of their treatment management
plan. On the basis of patterns of care studies by Eifel
et al,11 we would expect that a larger percentage of
women would receive ICRT. However, the lower percentage may reflect the finding that our data was
population-based and included smaller community
hospitals where, in the analysis by Eifel et al, patients
were less likely to receive ICRT. The lower rates may
also be because of several other factors, including
lack of an appropriate facility to deliver ICRT in the
community, distance to a facility offering ICRT, and
patient compliance.
Finally, 11% and 5% of women with stage II to
IVA disease did not receive radiation therapy in 2000
and 2001, respectively. Only 1% of patients in 2000
and 3.5% of patients in 2001 refused radiation therapy. We were not able to determine the explanation
for this lack of therapy in the remaining patients.
Surgical therapies for women with FIGO stage I
disease were 15% local destruction (including conization), 30% total hysterectomy, and 40% radical hysterectomy. These percentages were unchanged from
1997 to 2001. There was a much smaller increase in

the use of chemotherapy and chemoradiation for
women with early stage disease, and these results
strongly suggest that surgical management remains
the primary therapy for FIGO I cervical cancer.
In this study, we found that advancing age
played a role in the therapeutic management of cervical cancer. Advancing age was associated with
decreased receipt of concurrent chemoradiation and
the combination of chemotherapy, EBRT, and ICRT.

After adjusting for therapy, as well as other factors,
the increased risk of all-causes mortality was higher
in older women. However, there was no significant
association between risk of death from cervical cancer and age after adjusting for race/ethnicity, insurance status, FIGO stage, grade, nodal status,
treatment, and year of diagnosis. These results would
suggest that older women, their families, and their
healthcare providers need to be educated about the

Treatment for Women with Cervical Cancer/Trimble et al

importance of screening for cervical cancer to find
cervical cancer at an earlier stage. Furthermore, it
may be essential to develop chemoradiation regimens that can be safely administered to older
women with cervical cancer, particularly those with
comorbidity.
At present there is no consensus in the developed world for the optimal pretreatment evaluation
for cervical cancer. Despite efforts by FIGO to develop a standardized algorithm, physician- and institution-specific approaches remain in light of rapid
technological developments in imaging modalities.
Data from the joint ACRIN/GOG trial suggests that
neither CT nor MRI provide reliable evaluation of
cervical stromal involvement or lymph node involvement.12 Institutions with expertise in positron emission tomography consider that particular modality a
more accurate predictor of lymph node involvement,
but there is still no national consensus on the optimal imaging modality.13 In addition, our findings
clearly suggest that many clinicians remain convinced that exam under anesthesia, as compared
with imaging, remains the most reliable means to
assess of local tumor size and extent of disease.
In conclusion, the analysis of these US population-based patterns of care data for cervical
malignancies during the period 1997-2001 has
demonstrated remarkable changes in the treatment
management of this disease, consistent with earlier
observations of Eifel et al11 and Barbera et al10 The
most significant change observed was the rapid shift
to the use of chemoradiation in the treatment of
women diagnosed with stage II to IVA disease, after
the dissemination of results from the 5 randomized
trials addressing the issue of chemoradiation.
