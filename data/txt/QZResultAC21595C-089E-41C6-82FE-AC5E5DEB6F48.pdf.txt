Abstract
The clinical efficacy of EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in non-small
cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harbouring activating EGFR mutations is limited by the
emergence of acquired resistance, mostly ascribed to the secondary EGFR-T790M
mutation. Selective EGFR-T790M inhibitors have been proposed as a new, extremely
relevant therapeutic approach. Here, we demonstrate that the novel irreversible
EGFR-TKI CNX-2006, a structural analog of CO-1686, currently tested in a phase-1/2
trial, is active against in vitro and in vivo NSCLC models expressing mutant EGFR,
with minimal effect on the wild-type receptor. By integration of genetic and functional
analyses in isogenic cell pairs we provide evidence of the crucial role played by
NF-κB1 in driving CNX-2006 acquired resistance and show that NF-κB activation
may replace the oncogenic EGFR signaling in NSCLC when effective and persistent
inhibition of the target is achieved in the presence of the T790M mutation. In this
context, we demonstrate that the sole, either genetic or pharmacologic, inhibition of
NF-κB is sufficient to reduce the viability of cells that adapted to EGFR-TKIs. Overall,
our findings support the rational inhibition of members of the NF-κB pathway as a
promising therapeutic option for patients who progress after treatment with novel
mutant-selective EGFR-TKIs.

patients [1-3]. Despite initial efficacy, the success of
EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) has been limited
by the emergence of drug resistance, often ascribed to
additional alterations within the target oncogene [4, 5].
The T790M mutation, which occurs within EGFR
catalytic pocket, plays the most important role among
the resistance mechanisms, arising in ~60% of the
cases [3, 6, 7]. Tumors harboring this mutation retain
their dependency on EGFR signaling for growth, thus
prompting the development of novel inhibitors of the
receptor [8]. Second-generation TKIs, such as afatinib
(BIBW2992) and dacomitinib (PF00299804), have shown
antitumor activity against T790M-NSCLC. However, the
lack of selectivity upon mutant EGFR as compared to
the wild-type (WT) receptor, and evidence of acquired
resistance to second-generation TKIs driven by the same
T790M mutation, emphasized the need to develop more
potent and specific agents against this mutation [9-11].
Selective EGFR-T790M inhibitors, including CO-1686
[12] and AZD9291 [13], have been proposed as alternative
salvage therapies and are currently undergoing clinical
development in patients who developed the T790M
mutation (NCT01526928, NCT01802632).
In this study, we demonstrated the in vitro and in
vivo selectivity and efficacy of the novel irreversible
EGFR-TKI CNX-2006, a structural analog of CO-1686, in
preclinical NSCLC models harboring activating mutations
and the T790M. A comparable activity was observed in
vitro for CO-1686. Furthermore, we developed isogenic
pairs of CNX-2006-sensitive and -resistant cancer cells
to address the mechanisms of resistance that may emerge
upon constant and selective inhibition of the EGFRT790M oncogene. By integrating genetic and functional
studies we demonstrated the key role of NF-κB1 in
driving adaptive resistance to CNX-2006 both through
overexpression and constitutive activation. Finally, we
showed that the inhibition of members of the NF-κB
pathway effectively reduced CNX-2006-resistant cells
proliferation and survival, thus supporting innovative
therapeutic strategies for patients who progress after
treatment with novel mutant-selective EGFR-TKIs.

kinase assays and tumor cell lines. Similar to erlotinib
and afatinib, CNX-2006 readily inhibited EGFR
phosphorylation in 293H cells harbouring either the exon
19 delE746-A750 or the L858R variant (Supplementary
Figure 2A). In NSCLC cells expressing the above
mentioned activating mutations (PC9 and HCC-827
cells), CNX-2006 concentrations ranging between 55
and 104 nM were sufficient to reduce to 50% (IC50) the
phosphorylation of EGFR after 2 hours treatment (Figure
1B). In cells expressing either EGFR-T790M alone or
the T790M mutation in cis with activating mutations,
CNX-2006 effectively inhibited the phosphorylation of
the receptor at low nanomolar concentrations while no
effect was observed after treatment with erlotinib (Figure
1B and Supplementary Figure 2A). Particularly, IC50s of
about 46 and 61 nM were obtained after 2 hours treatment
with CNX-2006 in the NSCLC cell lines NCI-H1975 and
PC9GR4, respectively (Figure 1B). Importantly, while
both erlotinib and afatinib inhibited the activity of the
WT-receptor at low nanomolar concentrations, CNX2006 affected the WT-EGFR only at concentrations which
are over 10-fold higher than the ones necessary to inhibit
mutated receptor (Figure 1B and Supplementary Figure
2A).
The efficacy of CNX-2006 was also tested against
rare EGFR mutations, including EGFR-G719S, -ex19ins
(I744-K745insKIPVAI), -L861Q, -ex20ins (H773V774HVdup), and -T854A. CNX-2006 was as active as
erlotinib against the former three variants of the receptor.
Partial sensitivity to CNX-2006 was also observed in
EGFR-T854A cells, while no effect was detected in
cells transfected with the ex20ins variant of the receptor
(Supplementary Figure 2B).
The selectivity of the inhibitor on the target was
tested in a panel of 62 recombinant protein kinases using
the radiometric assay HotSpot [14]. Eleven kinases,
including EGFR-L858R/T790M and WT-EGFR, showed
inhibition >50% after treatment with 1 µM CNX-2006
(Figure 1C and Supplementary Table 1). The most
effective inhibition, about 95.96%, was observed against
mutant EGFR, and high levels of inhibition were also
observed for EGFR-sequence-related kinases. The only
exception to this cluster was the cell cycle checkpoint
Chk2, member of the calcium and calmodulin-regulated
kinases. When tested in NCI-H1975 cells, CNX-2006
showed a strong profile of inhibition of EGFR downstream
signaling pathways relative to DMSO treated cells. One
µM CNX-2006 reduced the phosphorylation of several
kinase substrates in a peptides based array, including
different members of the MAPK, PI3K, Src and CDK
families (Supplementary Table 2 and 3). In the same
conditions, no evidence of inhibition of either EGFR or
downstream signaling pathway was achieved by 1 µM
gefitinib in NCI-H1975 (Supplementary Table 2).

CNX-2006 is structurally related to CO-1686
(Figure 1A), and acts as a potent mutant-selective EGFR
inhibitor through covalent interaction with the highly
conserved Cys797 residue in the kinase domain of EGFR
(Supplementary Figure 1A-1C).

than gefitinib and erlotinib, and 55-fold more effective
than second-generation EGFR-TKIs, in PC9DR1 cells
carrying a focal amplification of EGFR-T790M (Figure
1D) [9]. Interestingly, resistance to gefitinib driven by
MET amplification resulted in resistance to both CNX2006 and CO-1686, with over 1000-fold drop in drug
activity in HCC-827GR5 cells compared to parental cells
[15]. The exceptional activity of the inhibitor in EGFRT790M cells was further confirmed in three-dimensional
tumor spheroids derived from NCI-H1975 cells. After
96 hours treatment with 1 µM CNX-2006, the initial
spheroids volume was reduced of about 40%, suggesting
the ability of the inhibitor to penetrate multicellular

In a panel of 23 NSCLC cell lines, the range of
variation in sensitivity to CNX-2006, expressed as 50%
growth inhibition concentration (GI50), was between
3 and 8000 nM (Table 1). Despite CO-1686 and CNX2006 displayed comparable activity in cells expressing
mutated EGFR, a higher selectivity was observed with
the latter compound due to its more limited activity
in cells harbouring the wild-type receptor (Table 1).
Importantly, CNX-2006 was up to 290-fold more active

structures (Figure 1E). Furthermore, increase of cellular
fragments in Sub-G1 phase, chromatin condensation and
nuclear fragmentation were observed after treatment with
the EGFR-TKI (Supplementary Figure 3A). Moreover,
reduction of the mitochondrial membrane potential, as
measured by DiOC6 staining, and loss of membrane
integrity by AnnexinV, showed that 24 hours treatment
with CNX-2006 effectively induced ~16% apoptosis in
NCI-H1975 cells (Supplementary Figure 3B-3C).

Consistent with its in vitro anti-proliferative effect
in cells carrying EGFR-T790M, CNX-2006 daily dosed at
either 25 or 50 mg/kg inhibited the growth of subcutaneous
NCI-H1975-derived tumors (Figure 2A). In the groups
treated with the inhibitor, tumor growth was observed
only after drug withdrawal (over day 18th in Figure 2A).
Reduction of target phosphorylation was observed 1 hour
after the administration of both the doses of the drug in
tumor tissue expressing mutant EGFR. Remarkably, as
observed in vitro, CNX-2006 did not affect the activation
of the wild-type receptor expressed in normal lung tissue

(Figure 2B and Supplementary Figure 4A). Of note, CNX2006 accumulation was observed 1 hour after the treatment
in lungs, with concentrations up to ~13 and ~7-fold higher
than in plasma and liver, respectively (Supplementary
Figure 4B). A similar behavior has previously been
reported for gefitinib that reached up to 10-fold higher
concentrations in lung tissue as compared to plasma 2
hours after either intravenous or oral administration [16,
17]. This accumulation has been more recently associated
with active uptake of the first-generation EGFR-TKI in
NSCLC cells by various members of the solute carrier
(SLC) superfamily of transporters [18, 19]. The tissue
specific distribution of various SLCs having CNX-2006
as a substrate may explain its preferential accumulation in
lungs as compared to liver or plasma.

MYCN, NRBP1, EPCAM, PKP4, RHOB, SNAI2, ASPH,
GDAP1 and IL7, were included in the large deletions
in 2p24.3-p21 and 8q12.3-q13.3 loci (Supplementary
Figure 6B). Similarly, the 4q31.2 locus has previously
been related to lung cancer development (Figure 3D)
[22]. Several genes important for cell differentiation
and proliferation are included in this locus, such as the
Hedgehog-interacting protein, Glycophorin A, IL15,
GRB2-associated binding protein-1 and SH3D19.
Overexpression of these genes in H1975CR cells was
confirmed by RNA-seq (Supplementary Dataset 1).

Chromosomal instability in CNX-2006-resistant
cells affects cell differentiation and proliferation

Further comparison of NCI-H1975 and H1975CR
cells transcriptomes showed similar expression patterns,
with only few exceptions (Figure 4A). The analysis of
RNA-seq using beta-binomial distribution [23] followed
by KEGG pathway analysis (Kanehisa Laboratories;
Kyoto University), and TopHat2 coupled Cufflinks
analysis, demonstrated a differential expression of genes
involved in cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix (ECM)
interaction. Specifically, decreased expression of CDH1
(epithelial cadherin: E-cadherin) was observed in CNX2006-resistant cells, further confirmed by immunoblot
analysis (Figure 4B). A concomitant reduction of β-catenin
was also observed in H1975CR cells (Figure 4B). Given
the role of cell adhesion in cancer aggressiveness,
we investigated the migratory and invasive behavior
of H1975CR cells. Surprisingly, the H1975CR cells
displayed a significantly reduced motility (P < 0.01) in a
wound-healing assay compared to parental cells, as well
as reduced invasiveness through the ECM (Figure 4C-4D).
Both behaviors were further reduced by the treatment with
1 µM CNX-2006.
To explore the mechanisms underlying these results,
we evaluated the effect of 1 µM CNX-2006 on EGFR
phosphorylation, as well as on the activation of its major
effectors. After 2 hours treatment, EGFR phosphorylation
was inhibited in both NCI-H1975 and H1975CR cells
with concomitant reduction of Akt and ERK1/2 activation
(Figure 5A). Despite their proliferation profile was
unaltered following EGFR knockdown, CNX-resistant
cells conserved a certain level of dependency on the
oncogene signaling for cellular motility as demonstrated
by the retained effect of the drug in this process.

Expression of altered cell adhesion patterns
reduced cell motility in H1975CR

In vitro acquired resistance to CNX-2006 was
achieved by applying escalating concentrations (up to 1
µM) in NCI-H1975 cells. After 8-10 months, we isolated
a pool of CNX-2006-resistant (CR) cells which was over
60-fold less sensitive to the drug (GI50=4.6 μM) compared
to the parental cell line (Figure 3A). Cross-resistance to
the quinazoline-derivatives afatinib and dacomitinib as
well as CO-1686 (GI50s>1 μM) was also observed (data
not shown). The obtained resistant cells showed increased
dimensions and acquired spindle-like morphology, a
shorter doubling time and a different cell cycle distribution
compared to parental cells. A significant increase (P <
0.01) in the number of cells in G2-M phase was observed
in H1975CR compared to NCI-1975 cells (Figure 3B3C). After over 3 months of drug withdrawal, H1975CR
sensitivity to CNX-2006 was partially restored, with GI50
at 72 hours treatment of 940 nM (Figure 3A). EGFRindependent growth and proliferation were confirmed
in H1975CR cells by transient EGFR knockdown
(Supplementary Figure 5A-5B).
Genome-wide high-resolution analysis of DNA
copy number variations was performed by array-CGH
in H1975CR cells and compared to the parental cells.
Chromosomal imbalances in the resistant cells mostly
overlapped the NCI-H1975 cells (Supplementary Figure
6A), including common DNA aberrations in lung cancer,
such as amplifications in locus 7p11.2, containing the
EGFR gene, and gains at 5p15.33-p15.31, 1q21-q25,
8q24.21 and 11q13 loci [http://AtlasGeneticsOncology.
org, 20]. Large deletions were observed in 9p24.1-p23 and
13q21 loci which were previously associated with lung
adenocarcinomas [21]. Three large regions emerged in
H1975CR cells that were differentially altered compared
to the parental cells, i.e. amplification in chromosome 4,
and deletions in chromosomes 2 and 8. Multiple genes
involved in cell survival and motility regulation, such as

development, EGFR-L858R/T790M was the only detected
target alteration, and no additional mutations emerged in
any of the other candidate genes. Furthermore, differently
from previously reported results describing resistance to
third generation EGFR-TKIs [25, 26], neither reduced
IGFBP3 gene expression nor MAPK1 amplification was
observed in CNX-2006-resistant cells by RNA-seq and
aCGH.
The reduced expression of CDH1 observed in
H1975CR cells, and previous results on the involvement
of EMT in NSCLC resistance to EGFR-TKI treatment
[12, 27, 28], led us to investigate the role of this process
in resistance to CNX-2006. Gene expression analysis of
the 76 genes included in the EMT signature developed
by Byers and colleagues was performed [29]. A broad
reduction in the expression of epithelial markers was
observed in H1975CR cells compared to parental cells,
while there was only slight or no increase in mesenchymal
markers (Supplementary Figure 7A). Results were
validated by qRT-PCR or immunoblot for various
EMT markers, including CLDN4, CLDN7, EPCAM,
ZEB1, FN1, AXL, MMP2 and vimentin (Figure 4B
and Supplementary Figure 7B). A key role for EMT in
resistance to CNX-2006 was excluded on the basis of
these results.
Activated kinases were investigated in parental
and H1975CR cells by high-throughput array to
unravel diversely triggered pathways that may drive
the resistance to CNX-2006. A pool of 30 differentially
phosphorylated (>2-fold) peptides was identified in CNX2006-resistant cells compared to parental cells (Figure
5B and Supplementary Table 2). The phosphorylation
sites on the peptides were associated with 24 kinases,
13 of which were downregulated in H1975CR cells,
including FGFR3, FAK1 and EGFR. Conversely, 11
kinases were upregulated in the resistant cells, including
ERBB4, PKC, MAPK1, and JAK. About 65% reduction
in EGFR autophosphorylation and ~40% enhancement in
MAPK1 (p42) activation was confirmed by immunoblot
in H1975CR cells compared to NCI-H1975 cells (Figure
5A). Interestingly, in line with recent results showing
the involvement of NF-κB signaling in modulating lung
cancer dependence upon EGFR oncogenic signaling [30],
17 of the modulated kinases could directly or indirectly be
linked to NF-κB pathway. Immunoblot analysis revealed
~30% overexpression of NF-κB1 (p50) and ~74% of
its precursor (p105), but not RELA (p65), in CNX2006-resistant compared to the parental cells (Figure
5A). In line with these results, about 3-fold increase in
ATM phosphorylation was also found in resistant cells
compared to NCI-H1975 (Supplementary Figure 8A).
NF-κB1 knockdown inhibited H1975CR cells viability of
~99%, while ~60% of the NCI-H1975 cells survived after
down-regulation of the transcription factor (Figure 5C and
Supplementary Figure 8B). Data on its activation further

development. The treatment with 1 µM CNX-2006 did
not affect the phosphorylation of the transcription factor
in H1975CR cells, while its complete inhibition was
achieved under the same conditions in parental cells
(Figure 5A). Basal activity of NF-κB as monitored by
fluorescence was 1.45-fold higher in H1975CR than in
parental cells (Figure 5D). Furthermore, the treatment
with either 1 µM CNX-2006 or CO-1686 caused ~50%
inhibition of NF-κB in NCI-H1975, while no effect was
observed in the resistant cells under the same conditions.

Pharmacological inhibition of NF-κB pathway
reduces cell viability in CNX-2006-resistant cells
The canonical activation of NF-κB relies on
phosphorylation-induced degradation of IκB family
members mediated by the IκB kinase (IKK) complex and
consequent nuclear translocation of NF-κB dimers [31].
Thus, we tested the effect of agents targeting the NFκB pathway at different levels. These drugs displayed
a greater efficacy in reducing cell viability of NF-κBdependent H1975CR cells than parental cells (Figure 6A6B). Particularly, the small molecule TPCA-1 reduced both
IKKβ and IkBα phosphorylation of ~70% in resistant cells
(Supplementary Figure 9A-9B) and had 4-fold increased
anti-proliferative effect in H1975CR compared to
NCI-H1975 cells. Prolonged inhibition of the proteasomes
by bortezomib also altered the pathway by causing IkBα
accumulation in H1975CR cells (Supplementary Figure
9C). The inhibitor effectively reduced cell viability in
both resistant and parental cells, with GI50 ~16.8 and 85.8
nM, respectively (Figure 6A-6B). Furthermore, the PI3K/
mTOR inhibitor BEZ-235 was also tested as it has been
shown to interfere with the ‘atypical’ NF-κB activation
pathway, which includes ATM, ATR and DNA-PK [32,
33]. The compound reduced ATM phosphorylation by
~20% in CNX-2006-resistant cells where it showed over
3-fold increased anti-proliferative effect over NCI-H1975
parental cells (Figure 6A and Supplementary Figure
9D). Despite the greater activity in CNX-2006 resistant
cells compared to parental cells, single agent TPCA-1
was unable to completely inhibit the pathway, as shown
by the residual phosphorylation of both IKKβ and IkBα
(Supplementary Figure 9A-9B). To achieve a greater
inhibition of the pro-survival signaling cascade, the NFκB pathway inhibitors TPCA-1, bortezomib or BEZ235, were combined with CNX-2006 at their respective
GI25. After 72 hours treatment, ~82%, ~88% and ~55%
inhibition of H1975CR cell viability was observed for
TPCA-1, bortezomib or BEZ-235, in combination with
CNX-2006, respectively (Figure 6C).

Akt inhibitors has recently been demonstrated in NSCLC
cell lines and patient samples, leading to the development
of a 76-gene signature defining the transformation process
[29]. A similar signature has been observed to drive
acquired resistance to CO-1686 in both NCI-H1975
and HCC-827 cells [12]. However, while confirming a
predictive role of altered E-cadherin/β-catenin expression
in response to EGFR-TKIs in NSCLC [42], our results
showed a reduction in the invasive behavior of CNX-2006resistant cells. A possible explanation for this discrepancy
is the down-regulation of FAK1 activity observed in
H1975CR cells, which is critical for growth factor
and integrin-induced cell migration [43]. Interestingly,
H1975CR cells motility was further inhibited by CNX2006 treatment, thus supporting the use of the inhibitor
as maintenance treatment after the emergence of drugresistance, as reported previously for other EGFR-TKIs
[44].
In the last decade, a critical role for NF-κB pathway
in lung cancer has been described in chemical-induced
lung tumor models [45] as well as in models harboring
commonly mutated genes such as KRAS and Trp53 [46].
Although the EGF-EGFR axis is known to activate NF-κB
signalling pathway through different mediators [47, 48],
erlotinib treatment did not affect NF-κB activation in a
variety of cancer cells, thus highlighting the complexity
of a pathway for which constitutive activation has been
associated to treatment resistance in different cancer
types [49-51]. Recently, Bivona and colleagues provided
evidence of the involvement of NF-κB in modulating lung
cancer dependence upon EGFR oncogenic signaling and
consequently in resistance to erlotinib [30]. The study
showed how inhibition of NF-κB signaling enhances
erlotinib-induced apoptosis in lung cancer cells harboring
activating mutations of EGFR. While the study by Bivona
et al. limited the relevance of the pathway to non-T790M
cells, we observed a lower expression of NF-κB1 in
PC9 as compared to PC9GR4 cells, where resistance
to gefitinib is driven by the acquisition of the T790M
mutation (data not shown).
In the present study, we demonstrate that persistent
NF-κB activation can intervene at different anti-EGFR
treatment stages and drive drug resistance in NSCLCs
carrying the T790M mutation. Despite its hyperactivation
in H1975CR cells, NF-κB signaling remains tightly
regulated by IKK and IκB. Indeed, we showed for the first
time that the sole inhibition of carefully selected members
of the NF-κB pathway, including IKKβ, is sufficient to
successfully antagonize tumor growth and overcame
resistance to CNX-2006. However, a possible explanation
for NF-κB activation in H1975CR cells may reside in a
cytokine-mediated upregulation of IKK family members.
Several cytokines were differentially modulated in CNX-

resistance that may emerge by targeting EGFR-T790M in
NSCLC and identified NF-κB as key player in adaptive
and reversible resistance to the novel mutant selective
EGFR inhibitor CNX-2006. For the first time, we
demonstrate that NF-κB pathway activation may replace
the oncogene signaling in lung cancer when effective and
persistent inhibition of EGFR is achieved in the presence
of the T790M mutation. In this context, we show that the
sole inhibition of NF-κB activity is sufficient to reduce
the viability of cells that developed resistance to thirdgeneration EGFR-TKI by becoming independent from the
signaling of the receptor.
Recent preclinical studies reported promising results
in terms of greater efficacy and selectivity against EGFRT790M by either reversible indolocarbazole-based or
irreversible pyrimidine-based TKIs, such as WZ4002,
AZD9291 and CO-1686 [12, 13, 34, 35]. Our results
demonstrate that CNX-2006 abrogates mutant-EGFR
activity, both in vitro and in vivo. Conversely, the weak
inhibition of WT-EGFR suggests a more limited toxicity
of CNX-2006 compared to first- and second-generation
TKIs [36, 37]. CNX-2006 also showed good stability and
favorable pharmacokinetics, and potently inhibited the
growth of tumor spheres and subcutaneous xenografts.
Given the clinical challenge represented by the
emergence of drug resistance against novel TKIs, acquired
resistance to CNX-2006 was investigated as an important
scenario to develop and test alternative treatment
strategies. To address this aim we developed isogenic pairs
of drug-sensitive and -resistant cancer cells, a strategy
which has already been successfully applied to model
EGFR-TKIs resistance in NSCLC [15, 27, 28, 38, 39].
In contrast to recent findings reporting the
acquisition of additional EGFR mutations driving the
resistance to WZ4002 [26, 40], we did not identify
any additional EGFR mutation that may explain the
secondary resistance to CNX-2006. Similarly, no
evidence of promoter-methylation-driven repression
of IGFBP3 expression and consequent activation of the
IGF1R pathway, a mechanism previously associated
with WZ4002-resistance in PC9 cells [25], was observed
in H1975CR. Despite H1975CR displayed increased
MAPK1 phosphorylation compared to NCI-H1975 cells,
neither genomic amplification nor enhanced expression
of MAPK1 was observed in CNX-2006-resistant cells,
all of which have been described to drive WZ4002
resistance in PC9GR cells [26]. Furthermore, unlike
previous findings in H1975 WZR cells [26], MAPK1
phosphorylation was completely abrogated by CNX-2006
treatment in H1975CR cells and no effect on cell viability
was observed after treatment with the MEK1/2 inhibitor
MEK162 (data not shown).
Our studies on CNX-2006-resistance demonstrated
RNA-based enrichment of deregulated cell-cell and cellECM adhesion patterns. In particular, E-cadherin and

2006-resistant compared to NCI-H1975 cells at gene
expression level, including some members of the TNF
family as well as interleukins which have previously been
shown to promote IKK activation (Supplementary Dataset
1).
In conclusion, this study demonstrates the excellent
efficacy of the novel mutant selective EGFR inhibitor
CNX-2006 in several representative preclinical models of
NSCLC. Furthermore, we provide evidence of the key role
of NF-κB signaling in driving lung cancer resistance when
effective and persistent inhibition of EGFR is achieved
in the presence of the T790M mutation. Whether NFκB upregulation existed prior to CNX-2006 treatment
in a subset of NCI-H1975 cells that expanded under
the pressure of drug selection, or emerged as adaptive
response to compensate the inhibition of EGFR is still
under investigation. However, regardless bortezomib
limited efficacy in unselected NSCLC patients [52], we
demonstrated that proteasome inhibition might represent
a valid therapeutic strategy to bypass NF-κB-mediated
EGFR-TKI resistance in selected patients. Furthermore,
here we demonstrated that NF-κB inhibition is also a valid
strategy to enhance the effect of third-generation EGFRTKIs in NSCLC expressing EGFR-T790M. Similarly,
previous studies reported a role for NF-κB inhibition in
sensitizing cells to erlotinib-induced cell death [26, 44].
This strategy is currently evaluated in a phase 1/2 clinical
trial by combining erlotinib and quinacrine in NSCLCs
(NCT01839955). Our results should pave the way for
molecular profiling on multiple levels in patients treated
with mutant-selective EGFR inhibitors and support the use
of novel treatment strategies to either overcome or delay
the escape from oncogene addiction in EGFR-mutant
NSCLC.

NCI-H1975 and the human epidermoid carcinoma A431
cells were purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA), and
cultured as recommended. 293H cells were purchased
from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). PC9, PC9GR4, PC9DR1
and HCC-827 GR5 were a kind gift of Dr. Pasi A. Jänne,
Harvard University, Boston, MA [13]. PC9/ER, HCC827/R1 and H3255/XLR cells are isogenic erlotinib- or
XL-647-resistant lines derived from PC9, HCC-827 and
NCI-H3255 cells, respectively, as previously described
[53]. Additional information on cell cultures procedures is
reported in the Supplemental Methods.

Transfections and siRNA
Transfections with mutant EGFR constructs were
performed in 293H cells using pcDNA3.1(-) vectors and
Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen; Carlsbad, CA). Two
µg DNA was used per sample as previously described
[54]. EGFR mutations G719S, ex19ins, ex20ins, L861Q,
T854A, T790M, and L858R/T790M were generated
by site-directed mutagenesis using a WT-EGFR cDNA
template as previously described [54].
Transfections with siRNA were performed on 1×105
cells/well plated into 6-well plates using Lipofectamine
2000. For all procedures, standard protocols were used
according to the manufacturers’ manuals. Synthetic
siRNA targeting either EGFR (ID#103549) or NF-kB1
(ID#107297) was purchased from Applied Biosystems/
Ambion (Foster City, CA). Non-Target siRNA was used
as control.

Tumor spheres
Spheroids from NCI-H1975 cells of about 300 µm
in diameter were generated and treated with 0.1% DMSO
or CNX-2006 at the NCI-H1975 GI50. Measurement and
analysis were performed as previously described [55].

mRNA Library Preparation Kit using poly-A-enriched
RNA (Illumina, San Diego, CA). Captured libraries were
sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq2000 platform with a
single-end 50-base protocol. Sequences were aligned to
the human genome (Hg19) with TopHat2 [56]. HTSeq was
used to assess the number of uniquely assigned reads for
each gene; expression values were then normalized to 107
total reads and log2 transformed (results are provided as
Supplementary Dataset 1). TopHat2 [http://tophat.cbcb.
umd.edu/index.shtml] and Cufflinks [http://cufflinks.
