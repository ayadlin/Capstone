Abstract
The peptidyl-prolyl isomerase Pin1 is frequently up-regulated
in human cancers in which Rel/nuclear factor-KB (NF-KB) is
constitutively activated, but its role in these cancers remains
to be determined, and evidence is still lacking to show that
Pin1 contributes to cell transformation by Rel/NF-KB. Rel/NFKB transcriptional and oncogenic activities are modulated by
several posttranslational modifications and coregulatory
proteins, and previous studies showed that cytokine treatment
induces binding of Pin1 to the RelA subunit of NF-KB, thereby
enhancing RelA nuclear localization and stability. Here we
show that Pin1 associates with the Rel subunits of NF-KB that
are implicated in leukemia/lymphomagenesis and modulates
their transcriptional and oncogenic activities. Pin1 markedly
enhanced transformation of primary lymphocytes by the
human c-Rel protein and also increased cell transformation
by the potent viral Rel/NF-KB oncoprotein v-Rel, in contrast to
a Pin1 mutant in the WW domain involved in interaction with
NF-KB. Pin1 promoted nuclear accumulation of Rel proteins
in the absence of activating stimuli. Importantly, inhibition
of Pin1 function with the pharmacologic inhibitor juglone
or with Pin1-specific shRNA led to cytoplasmic relocalization
of endogenous c-Rel in human lymphoma-derived cell lines,
markedly interfered with lymphoma cell proliferation, and
suppressed endogenous Rel/NF-KB–dependent gene expression. Together, these results show that Pin1 is an important
regulator of Rel/NF-KB transforming activity and suggest
that Pin1 may be a potential therapeutic target in
Rel/NF-KB–dependent leukemia/lymphomas. [Cancer Res

Introduction
The Rel/nuclear factor-nB (NF-nB) family of inducible transcription factors play pivotal roles in innate and adaptive immunity,
inflammation, and oncogenesis and include the c-Rel, RelA, RelB,
NF-nB1 (p50/p105), and NF-nB2 (p52/p100) proteins (1). In most

cells, NF-nB exists as latent cytoplasmic homo-/heterodimers,
bound to inhibitory InB proteins. Stimuli that activate the classic
NF-nB cascade trigger the InB kinase complex that mediates
phosphorylation of InBa, resulting in proteasomal degradation of
InBa and nuclear translocation of NF-nB dimers as well as their
binding to nB DNA sites. This commonly results in transcriptional
activation of genes important for the immune and inflammatory
response, cell proliferation, adhesion, angiogenesis, and inhibition
of apoptosis (1–6). Binding of NF-nB to the promoter for the IjBa
gene triggers a negative feedback loop that terminates NF-nB
activation (1). Hence, under normal conditions, activation of the
classic Rel/NF-nB cascade is transient due to tight regulation of
NF-nB subcellular localization by InBa. Interference with this
process can have severe consequences, as sustained activation of
Rel/NF-nB is seen in many cancers where it promotes tumor cell
survival, pathogenesis, and chemoresistance (7).
The peptidyl-prolyl isomerase Pin1 interacts specifically and
exclusively with certain phospho-serine/threonine-proline (pSer/
Thr-Pro) motifs in target proteins via its NH2-terminal WW domain
and catalyzes rapid cis/trans isomerization of proline amide bonds
through its COOH-terminal domain (8–10). This commonly alters
the conformation and biological function of substrates and can
have profound physiologic relevance. Interaction of Pin1 with
target proteins like p53, p73, cyclin D1, p66shc, tau, APP, and IRF-3
has been implicated in cell cycle control, cellular stress, neuronal
degeneration, and tumor progression (11).
Pin1 was shown to associate with the p65/RelA subunit of NF-nB
and to promote RelA nuclear translocation and extend its half-life
by blocking its inhibition by InBa and its SOCS-1–dependent
degradation (12). Interestingly, Pin1 is up-regulated in human
breast cancer specimens and mouse mammary tumors and is
correlated with nuclear accumulation of RelA (12, 13). Oncomine
database analysis revealed markedly elevated Pin1 levels in breast
carcinoma and in human B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia,
diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma, and multiple
myeloma in which constitutive nuclear activation of NF-nB is
necessary for cell survival and proliferation (Supplementary Fig. S1;
refs. 14–24). These observations suggest that Pin1 may contribute
to Rel/NF-nB function in cancer. However, the role of Pin1 in
oncogenesis has been a subject of controversy (25), and there is no
direct evidence that Pin1 plays a role in Rel/NF-nB–dependent
tumor cells. Here we show that Pin1 associates with Rel proteins
and show that it significantly potentiates their transforming
activity in primary lymphocytes, coincident with increased Rel
nuclear accumulation. We show that knockdown of Pin1 prompts
the cytoplasmic relocalization of endogenous c-Rel in multiple
Rel/NF-nB–dependent human lymphoma-derived cell lines,
resulting in inhibition of tumor cell proliferation and decreased

Endogenous Pin1 was detected with a monoclonal anti-Pin1 generated in
the laboratory of KPL. Where indicated, 293T cells were treated with human
tumor necrosis factor a (hTNFa; 10 ng/mL; Roche) for 40 min. Endogenous
hc-Rel was coimmunoprecipitated with endogenous Pin1 in extracts (1 mg)
from lymphoma cells pretreated with hTNFa, followed by immunoprecipitation with polyclonal anti-Pin1 (Santa Cruz) and immunoblotting with
anti–hc-Rel (#265). The membrane was stained with Ponceau S.
Transformation of primary chicken lymphoid cells. Primary chicken
spleen cells were infected as described (3) with virus coexpressing v-Rel or hcRel along with wild-type or mutant Pin1. Transformed colonies in soft agar
were scored after 2 wk. Animals were used according to the Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee guidelines under an approved protocol.
Immunofluorescence and cell fractionation. Cells (105) fixed with 4%
paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 were analyzed
by immunofluorescence with anti–hc-Rel (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and a
rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibody (The Jackson Laboratory),
followed by staining with Hoechst 33258 (Sigma). Where indicated,
lymphoma cells were pretreated with juglone (0.1–10 Amol/L; Calbiochem)
for 2 h or with DMSO as control.
Karpas 1106 cells treated with juglone (0.1–10 Amol/L) for 2 h were
resuspended in hypotonic buffer [20 mmol/L HEPES (pH 7.6), 20% glycerol.

10 mmol/L KCl, 0.2 mmol/L EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 5 mmol/L NaF,
10 mmol/L glycerophosphate, 1 mmol/L Na3VO4, 1 mmol/L DTT, 1 mmol/L
phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 PIC] on ice for 10 min, followed by
centrifugation at 10,000  g to recover the cytosolic fraction. Nuclear pellets
resuspended in hypertonic buffer containing 600 mmol/L KCl were
centrifuged at 10,000  g. Extracts (40 Ag) were analyzed by Western
blotting with anti-Rel #265 and reprobed with anti-actin or anti-PARP
(Cell Signaling) as cytosolic and nuclear markers.
RNA interference and reverse transcription-PCR. Pin1 shRNA in
pSuper or a scrambled nontargeting shRNA control from KPL was delivered
into human lymphoma cells by Amaxa nucleofection using Kit V (Amaxa
AG), and programs were optimized for each cell line for transfection
efficiencies >90% with pMaxGFP (Karpas 1106: X-001; KM-H2 and MedB-1:
T-001). Reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) was done within the linear
range of the PCR cycle using primers specific for pin1 (tgatcaacggctacatccag, caaacgaggcgtcttcaaat), cyclin D1 (ctggagcccgtgaaaaagagc, ctggagaggaagcgtgtgagg), vegf (ccctgatgagatcgagtacatctt, aacgctccaggacttataccg),
Bfl-1 (caggctggctcaggactatc, cccagttaatgatgccgtct), and actin (tgacccacccagcacattta, tgaaagcagggcctgagg).
Cell proliferation and survival assays. The effects of juglone
(0.1 Amol/L) or Pin1 shRNA on the proliferation and survival of lymphoma
cells were determined by cell counting in the presence of trypan blue
exclusion dye during a time course (0–24 h for juglone versus DMSO control
or 0–144 h for Pin1 shRNA versus scrambled shRNA control).

activity of Rel proteins. A, Pin1 and mutant S16A

Pin1(S16A)-GFP and GST-v-Rel or GST, followed by

antibodies to v-Rel (#2716) or hc-Rel (#265; top ) or GFP
(middle ), and reprobed for actin as control (bottom ).

Results
Pin1 associates with the v-Rel and c-Rel subunits of NF-KB.
Human RelA was shown to interact with Pin1 via the Thr254-Pro
motif in its Rel-homology domain (12). Sequence alignment revealed
conservation of this motif among vertebrate Rel/NF-nB family
members. NH2-terminal sequences flanking this motif share a high
degree of similarity and are in some cases identical, whereas those
flanking its COOH-terminal end are significantly more divergent
(Fig. 1A). Because overexpression of the Rel proteins can malignantly
transform primary lymphocytes in vitro and induce fatal leukemia/
lymphoma and mammary adenocarcinomas in animal models,
unlike RelA (26, 28–31), we directly addressed the role of Pin1 in
Rel/NF-nB–mediated oncogenesis by investigating its effects on the
transforming activity of the v-Rel and hc-Rel proteins.
We used GST pull-downs to determine if Pin1 could engage
in physical interaction with Rel proteins. As expected, Pin1 is
ubiquitously expressed in human 293T cells, in primary chicken
spleen cells transformed by v-Rel, and in human lymphoma Karpas
1106 cells in which NF-nB is markedly activated due to nuclear
accumulation of hc-Rel (ref. 32; Fig. 1B). GST-Pin1 interacted both
with v-Rel and its cellular homologue hc-Rel in human 293T cells,
compared with the GST control (Fig. 1C, left, lane 3 versus lane 2).
Interestingly, whereas association of RelA with Pin1 depends on
cell stimulation with cytokine TNFa that triggers phosphorylation
and activation of RelA (12), TNFa treatment had little or no effect
on the interaction of either v-Rel or hc-Rel with GST-Pin1 (Fig. 1C,
left, lane 6 versus lane 3; right, lanes 4, 8, 12 versus lanes 3, 7, 11).
GST-Pin1 also interacted with endogenous v-Rel from v-Rel–
transformed chicken spleen cells and with endogenous hc-Rel in
extracts from the human lymphoma cell line Karpas 1106 (Fig. 1D,
left, lanes 3, 6 versus lanes 2, 5). Importantly, coimmunoprecipitation assays verified association between endogenous Pin1 and
endogenous hc-Rel in lymphoma-derived cell lines, particularly
evident in KM-H2 and MedB-1 cells (Fig. 1D, right, lane 2 versus
lane 3, lane 5 versus lane 6, and lane 8 versus lane 9). These results
show that v-Rel and hc-Rel can specifically associate with Pin1.
Conversely, Pin1 transfected in 293T cells was pulled down with
GST-v-Rel, confirming their interaction (Fig. 2A, lane 7 versus lane 4).
In contrast, a Pin1 mutant with a serine to glutamate substitution at
position 16 (S16E) in the NH2-terminal WW domain that interacts
with pSer/Thr-Pro motifs showed significantly less interaction with
GST-v-Rel (lane 9). This is consistent with the failure of this mutant
to efficiently associate with RelA (12). A mutant with substitution of
serine 16 to alanine (S16A) retained the ability to interact with GSTv-Rel, although with somewhat reduced efficiency (Fig. 2A, lane 2).
Consistent with previous findings that Pin1(S16A) constitutively
binds to Pin1 substrates, in contrast to S16E (33), our data show that
v-Rel preferentially associates with Pin1 and Pin1(S16A).
Pin1 markedly enhances the transforming activities of
hc-Rel and v-Rel. We investigated the ability of Pin1 to modulate
the oncogenic activity of Rel proteins in primary lymphocytes,

of hc-Rel in the nucleus of infected chicken embryonic fibroblasts.

Pin1 Promotes Rel Transforming Activity

Figure 4. Juglone induces cytoplasmic relocalization of endogenous hc-Rel in human lymphoma cells. Immunofluorescence analysis of endogenous hc-Rel subcellular
localization in the presence of increasing concentrations of juglone (0.1, 1, or 10 Amol/L) for 2 h in human lymphoma-derived KM-H2 (A), MedB-1 (B), or Karpas
1106 (C ) cell lines, compared with DMSO control, using anti–hc-Rel and a rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibody. Nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33258 dye.
D, fractionation of Karpas 1106 cells treated with juglone for 2 h confirmed rapid redistribution of endogenous hc-Rel from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. The blots
were probed with anti–hc-Rel and reprobed for uncleaved PARP (f115 kDa) or actin as nuclear and cytosolic markers. Histograms show quantitation of hc-Rel band
intensities in the nucleus and cytoplasm normalized to those of PARP and actin.

using a bicistronic retroviral vector to coexpress v-Rel or hc-Rel
along with GFP-tagged Pin1 or mutants S16A and S16E. Western
blots confirmed equivalent expression of all proteins (Fig. 2B).
Coexpression of Pin1-GFP significantly increased the already
potent transforming activity of v-Rel in primary lymphocytes
nearly 2-fold, as seen by colony formation in soft agar (Fig. 2C). In
contrast, Pin1(S16E) failed to do so, consistent with its very weak
association with v-Rel (Fig. 2C). Coexpression of Pin1(S16A)
generally enhanced the efficiency of v-Rel–mediated transformation, albeit less than wild-type Pin1. Importantly, the effects of
Pin1 on lymphocyte transformation by the cellular hc-Rel protein
were even more pronounced, despite variability in the efficiency of
individual transformation assays that is commonly observed in these
assays with primary chicken splenocytes, particularly with more
weakly transforming proteins, like hc-Rel. Whereas hc-Rel coexpressed with GFP failed to transform cells, Pin1 and Pin1(S16A)
markedly boosted hc-Rel transforming activity, yielding up to

20 colonies that could be picked and propagated in liquid culture,
in contrast to Pin1(S16E) (Fig. 2C). Enhancement of Rel-mediated
transformation did not result from Pin1 acting as an oncogene
because neither Pin1-GFP nor its mutants could transform
splenocytes on their own (Fig. 2C). These results show that Pin1
markedly increases Rel-mediated transformation. Given the weak
transforming activity of hc-Rel (26, 31), these data suggest that Pin1
may play a significant role in enhancing hc-Rel oncogenic activity.
Pin1 increases the nuclear distribution of v-Rel and hc-Rel.
The ability of Pin1 to enhance the transforming activity of
hc-Rel and v-Rel led us to investigate its effect on their subcellular
localization. Previous studies showed that Pin1 and Pin1(S16A)
localize to the nucleus, whereas Pin1(S16E) is diffused throughout
the cell (33). Immunofluorescence showed that Pin1-GFP localizes
to the nucleus of infected chicken embryonic fibroblasts, and its
coexpression with either v-Rel or hc-Rel prompted their relocalization to the nucleus (Fig. 3A and B). This is consistent with the

Figure 5. Juglone interferes with cell survival and/or growth in Rel-dependent human lymphoma cells. Treatment of human lymphoma-derived KM-H2 (A) or MedB-1
(B) cells with 0.1 Amol/L juglone during a time course induces cell death compared with the DMSO control, as determined by live cell count following trypan blue
exclusion staining. Whereas this treatment did not affect the survival of Karpas 1106 cells (C ), juglone significantly interfered with Karpas 1106 cell growth compared

ability of Pin1 to enhance their transforming potential. In contrast,
Pin1(S16E) expressed alone was found in both the cytoplasm and
the nucleus and was unable to induce nuclear accumulation of
v-Rel or hc-Rel. Pin1(S16A) was primarily nuclear, with low-level
residual localization to the cytoplasm, and effectively prompted
nuclear accumulation of v-Rel and hc-Rel in infected chicken
embryonic fibroblasts. This agrees with the capacity of Pin1(S16A)
to retain association with Rel proteins and enhance their transforming activity. These results indicate that Pin1 can promote
nuclear localization of Rel factors and that this is correlated
with enhanced Rel transforming activity.
We investigated the relevance of these observations in the
physiologic setting of transformed primary lymphocytes by probing
the effects of Pin1 or its mutants on the subcellular localization
of hc-Rel in chicken spleen cells. As anticipated, hc-Rel was
predominantly cytoplasmic in primary splenocytes transformed by
hc-Rel alone, as previously reported (Fig. 3C, left; refs. 26, 31).
However, hc-Rel was predominantly nuclear in splenocytes transformed by its coexpression with Pin1, consistent with their
increased transforming efficiency. In contrast, Pin1(S16E), which
showed very weak association with Rel, was unable to promote
nuclear localization of hc-Rel, in agreement with its inability to
enhance hc-Rel-mediated transformation. These data suggest that
Rel proteins are substrates for the peptidyl-prolyl isomerase activity
of Pin1, and that Pin1 may significantly enhance their oncogenic
activity by changing the equilibrium between their localization to
the nucleus versus cytoplasm.
Juglone induces cytoplasmic relocalization of endogenous
hc-Rel in lymphoma cells, coincident with lymphoma cell
death and/or growth inhibition. Because Pin1 significantly
increased the transforming activity of hc-Rel, we asked if

endogenous Pin1 plays a role in the subcellular distribution of
endogenous hc-Rel in human lymphoma-derived cells because
Pin1 is highly expressed in lymphoma cells in which Rel/NF-nB
is activated (Fig. 1B, lane 3; Supplementary Fig. S1). Juglone
(5-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone) is a natural and irreversible
inhibitor of the parvulin family of peptidyl-prolyl isomerases that
block the interaction of Pin1 with its substrates by covalently
modifying its only two cysteine residues (Cys57 and Cys113;
ref. 34). Juglone is frequently used to study the relevance of
Pin1 function in cells and in vivo because it can give rise to a
similar phenotype as Pin1 dominant negative mutants or Pin1
knockdown (35–37). We analyzed the effects of juglone on the
distribution of endogenous hc-Rel in human lymphoma cell lines in
which Rel/NF-nB is constitutively activated, including KM-H2,
MedB-1, and Karpas 1106 cells (32, 38, 39). Treatment with
increasing concentrations of juglone for 2 hours provoked rapid
redistribution of predominantly nuclear hc-Rel to the cytoplasm in
a dose-dependent manner compared with DMSO control (Fig. 4A–
C). hc-Rel was efficiently excluded from the nucleus with 1 Amol/L
juglone, and its cytoplasmic relocalization was detected with as
little as 0.1 Amol/L juglone in KM-H2 cells. Fractionation of
Karpas 1106 cells confirmed the significant redistribution of
hc-Rel on treatment with juglone in a dose-dependent manner
(Fig. 4D). These data suggest that Pin1 may play a role in
modulating the localization of endogenous hc-Rel in human
lymphoma cells.
Given the important implications of our finding that Pin1 can
markedly enhance the transforming activity of hc-Rel, we
investigated the effect of inhibiting Pin1 function with juglone
on the biological properties of human lymphoma cells in which
Rel/NF-nB is constitutively activated. We found that significant

within 2 hours of treatment, triggered 20% to 30% cell death within
4 hours of treatment compared with DMSO (Fig. 5A and B).
Whereas there was no significant difference in the survival for
Karpas 1106 cells subjected to the same treatment (Fig. 5C), these
cells displayed a noticeable decrease in growth rate starting at
6 hours posttreatment. By 24 hours, the growth of Karpas 1106
cells was severely blunted compared with those treated with DMSO
(Fig. 5D). These data indicate that juglone restricts hyperproliferation and compromises the survival of tumor-derived cells.
Pin1 knockdown prompts cytoplasmic relocalization of
hc-Rel, interferes with lymphoma cell growth, and suppresses
Rel/NF-KB–dependent gene expression. Because pharmacologic
inhibition of Pin1 with juglone could have some indirect and/or

off-target effects, we used a Pin1-specific shRNA to verify our
hypothesis. Nucleofection of Pin1 shRNA significantly reduced Pin1
protein levels at 96 hours in all lymphoma cell lines tested,
compared with the nontargeting shRNA control (Fig. 6A, lane 2
versus lane 1). Consistent with our findings with juglone, Pin1
knockdown prompted redistribution of endogenous hc-Rel to
the cytoplasm compared with the shRNA control, as seen by
immunofluorescence (Fig. 6B). Furthermore, Pin1 shRNA significantly interfered with the proliferation of all lymphoma cell lines
compared with the shRNA control (Fig. 6C) but did not affect
their viability (data not shown). This indicates that juglone has
some off-target effects. Importantly, Pin1 knockdown with
shRNA significantly reduced the expression of known endogenous
Rel/NF-nB target genes including cyclin D1, VEGF, and Bfl-1
(Fig. 6D). Together with our finding that Pin1 promotes lymphocyte
transformation by v-Rel and hc-Rel, these results show that
Pin1 is an important modulator of Rel/NF-nB function in
transcription and oncogenesis.

Discussion
Accumulating evidence shows that Pin1 is up-regulated in many
human cancers including breast, prostate, lung, hepatic, cervical,
and colon cancers, and that increased expression of Pin1 is
correlated with poor prognosis in prostate cancer (13, 40–42).
Because ablation of Pin1 could prevent development of mammary
carcinoma induced by oncogenic Neu or Ras in mice, this suggests
an important role for Pin1 in cancer (43). Others suggested that it
plays a tumor suppressor role (25). Indeed, loss of Pin1 can
reportedly lead to deregulation of cyclin E and c-Myc, thereby
increasing genomic instability, and is believed to sensitize cells to
oncogenic transformation (44, 45). Here we provide evidence that
Pin1 functionally associates with the oncogenic Rel subunits of
NF-nB and that this interaction plays an important role in
promoting the nuclear localization and the transcriptional, proproliferative, and transforming properties of Rel proteins. We show
that Pin1 markedly enhances the weak transforming activity of
hc-Rel in primary lymphocytes. We also show that inhibition of
Pin1 severely compromises proliferation of Rel/NF-nB–dependent
human lymphoma cells and is accompanied by suppression of
Rel/NF-nB–dependent gene expression. These findings are consistent with accumulating evidence supporting an important role
for Pin1 deregulation during tumorigenesis and the pro-proliferative capacity of tumor cells (46), and emphasize an important
role in Rel oncogenic activity. This may be particularly relevant
because up-regulation of Pin1 is seen in many human leukemia
and lymphoma specimens in which Rel/NF-nB is known to be
constitutively activated (Supplementary Fig. S1).
Whereas Pin1 failed to transform primary lymphocytes on its
own, it significantly enhanced Rel transforming activity dependent
on its ability to alter the dynamics of Rel protein nuclear import/
export to tip the equilibrium in favor of increased nuclear
accumulation. This most likely results from the ability of Pin1 to
induce proline isomerization, thereby preventing Rel inhibition by
InBa (12). In this regard, it is not surprising that Pin1 had a more
dramatic effect in enhancing the transforming activity of the
weakly transforming hc-Rel protein compared with the potently
oncogenic v-Rel because v-Rel is known to be significantly more
resistant to inhibition by InBa than c-Rel (47). Up-regulation of
Pin1 may thus emerge as a novel means to enhance the
contribution of hc-Rel in human cancer by helping to dampen its
negative feedback inhibition. Additionally, because the 14-3-3
proteins can facilitate efficient nuclear export of InBa-p65
complexes by binding to both RelA/p65 and InBa, and 14-3-3
binds to RelA (amino acids 278–283) in close proximity of the
Thr254-Pro recognition motif for Pin1 (48), this raises the
possibility that Pin1 might also preclude export of NF-nB/InB
complexes by interfering with NF-nB regulation by 14-3-3. In both
scenarios, altered nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling of Rel/NF-nB

following up-regulation of Pin1 would contribute to sustained
activation of Rel/NF-nB signaling and oncogenesis.
The NH2-terminal sequences that flank the RelA Thr254-Pro motif
are highly conserved among Rel/NF-nB family members, but greater
variability is seen in those that flank its COOH terminus. Although
the kinase responsible for phosphorylation of Thr254 in the RelA
Thr-Pro motif has yet to be identified, efficient association of RelA
with Pin1 is dependent on cell stimulation with cytokine TNFa
(ref. 12; Fig. 1C, right). In contrast, TNF had little effect on the
interaction of v-Rel or hc-Rel with Pin1 (Fig. 1C). This, together with
the sequence divergence at the COOH terminus of the Pin1
recognition motif in Rel/NF-nB proteins, suggests that different
regulatory mechanisms may dictate interaction of Pin-1 with Rel and
RelA proteins. Further studies will be needed to address this issue.
Our finding that Pin1 knockdown compromised the growth of
Rel-dependent lymphoma cells and the expression Rel-dependent
target genes points to Pin1 as a possible therapeutic target in these
and other Rel-dependent tumors. However, because pharmacologic
inhibition of Pin1 with juglone compromised both the growth and
the survival of lymphoma cells, it seems that juglone shows some
off-target effects. Indeed, juglone has been shown to affect the
activity of RNA polymerase II through Pin1 and to also prevent
postmitotic protein dephosphorylation (49, 50), although its effects
on the growth and survival of lymphoma cells were observed at a
concentration 10- to 75-fold lower than those reported to inhibit
the activity of RNA polymerase II (49) or block dephosphorylation
of mitotic phosphoproteins (50). Nevertheless, our results with
Pin1 shRNA revealed off-target effects for juglone and suggest that
more specific inhibitors of Pin1 will need to be identified for
possible therapeutic application. Overall, our studies show that
Pin1 plays a crucial role in promoting Rel-mediated transcription
and transformation, and that inhibition of Pin1 can significantly
compromise the proliferation of Rel-dependent lymphoma cells.
Thus, Pin1 may be an attractive therapeutic target in Rel/NF-nB–
dependent leukemia/lymphomas.
