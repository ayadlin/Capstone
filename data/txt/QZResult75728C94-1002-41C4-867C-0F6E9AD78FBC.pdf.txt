ABSTRACT
Cells degrade proteins either by proteasomes that clinically are targeted by for
example bortezomib or carfilzomib, or by formation of autophagosomes and lysosomal
degradation that can be inhibited by hydroxychloroquine (HCQ). Multiple myeloma
is unique among cancers because proteasomal inhibition has good clinical effects.
However, some multiple myeloma patients display intrinsic resistance to the treatment
and most patients acquire resistance over time. We hypothesized that simultaneous
targeting both arms of protein degradation could be a way to improve treatment of
multiple myeloma. Here we tested the combined effects of the lysosomal inhibitor HCQ
and clinically relevant proteasome inhibitors on myeloma cell lines and primary cells.
Carfilzomib and bortezomib both induced immunoglobulin-containing aggregates in
myeloma cells. HCQ significantly potentiated the effect of carfilzomib in both cell lines
and in primary myeloma cells. In contrast, HCQ had little or no effects on the toxicity
of bortezomib. Furthermore, cells adapted to tolerate high levels of carfilzomib could
be re-sensitized to the drug by co-treatment with HCQ. Thus, we show that inhibition
of lysosomal degradation can overcome carfilzomib resistance, suggesting that the
role of autophagy in myeloma cells is dependent on type of proteasome inhibitor.
In conclusion, attempts should be made to combine HCQ with carfilzomib in the
treatment of multiple myeloma.

second-generation proteasome inhibitors such as the
recently approved drug carfilzomib have been developed
[2, 3]. Intriguingly, it is not necessarily the same patients
that benefit from bortezomib and carfilzomib treatment,
indicating that the drugs may have different and unknown
determinants of sensitivity and resistance [4].

INTRODUCTION
Multiple myeloma is one of a few cancers where
inhibition of proteasome activity is an efficient treatment
strategy. Thus, the introduction of bortezomib (Velcade)
more than 10 years ago has led to substantial prolongation
of survival of myeloma patients [1]. However, not all
patients respond to bortezomib, and over time most
patients become resistant to the treatment. A number of

in the bone marrow. Overproduction and misfolding
of monoclonal immunoglobulin results in formation
of intracellular protein aggregates, and the presence of
unfolded proteins and protein aggregates are indeed
hallmarks of both normal and malignant plasma cells
[5]. For plasma cells to survive, the unfolded protein
response is constitutively activated [6, 7]. Thus, the
particular sensitivity of myeloma cells towards inhibition
of proteasomes may be due to the high levels of monoclonal
immunoglobulin production and the accompanying stress
[6]. Extensive attempts to target various parts of the protein
degradation machinery for treatment of multiple myeloma
have been explored [7, 8]. In principle, eukaryotic cells
have two distinct but interconnected mechanisms for
protein degradation and removal of misfolded proteins or
protein aggregates [9, 10]. One is the ubiquitin-proteasomesystem where proteins are poly-ubiquitinated for subsequent
degradation by proteasomes. This pathway is targeted by
drugs such as bortezomib and carfilzomib. The second one
is sequestration of protein aggregates into autophagosomes
and subsequent lysosomal degradation, a process known
as macro-autophagy (hereafter referred to as autophagy).
Cargo targeted for degradation by autophagy may also be
labeled by ubiquitin [9]. These degradation pathways can
compensate for each other, but the underlying mechanisms
are unclear [10]. Treatment of plasma cells with proteasomal
inhibitors lead to accumulation of immunoglobulincontaining aggregates, and autophagy has been indicated to
be important in removal of such aggregates [5].
There have been several attempts of targeting
autophagy/lysosomal protein degradation for disease
treatment [11, 12]. A number of phase I clinical trials
have tested the lysosomal inhibitor hydroxychloroquine
(HCQ)[13], either used alone or combined with various
chemotherapeutic drugs, in different types of cancers.
HCQ is an attractive drug in this respect as it is already
approved for clinical use in treatment of malaria. HCQ is
known to increase lysosomal pH, thereby inhibiting protein
hydrolysis and fusion of lysosomes with autophagosomes.
Results of a phase I clinical trial combining bortezomib and
HCQ in myeloma treatment has recently been reported [14].
Here, we investigate if autophagy plays a role for
myeloma cell survival under conditions of proteasomal
inhibition. Treatment with both bortezomib and carfilzomib
resulted in accumulation of approximately similar levels
of immunoglobulin-containing aggregates in myeloma
cells. Interestingly, inhibition of autophagy and lysosomal
protein degradation with HCQ or Bafilomycin A1 (BafA1)
potentiated carfilzomib toxicity towards myeloma cells,
whereas little or no additional effect were obtained by
adding HCQ to cells treated with bortezomib. Cells
selected to tolerate high amounts of carfilzomib were resensitized to carfilzomib when treated in the presence of
HCQ. Furthermore, cells selected for carfilzomib resistance
expressed significantly elevated levels of the autophagy
receptor SQSTM1 (p62), and conversely, overexpression
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

of SQSTM1 increased tolerance to carfilzomib-induced
cytotoxicity. Our findings suggest that autophagy plays
a role for cell survival in carfilzomib-treated cells and
provide a rationale for clinical trials with treatment
combining carfilzomib and HCQ in both carfilzomib-naïve
and -resistant myeloma patients.

RESULTS
Myeloma cells contain intracellular aggregates
and aggregate formation is strongly augmented
by proteasome inhibitors
When untreated ANBL-6 myeloma cells were stained
with anti-immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH), distinct
spots in the cell cytosol could be observed (Figure 1A and
Supplementary Figure S1). This observation of cytosolic
immunoglobulin-containing aggregates is in line with
earlier reported observations in antibody-producing
plasma cells [5]. Spots were also positive for SQSTM1
(p62) (Figure 1A) and conjugated ubiquitin (not shown).
SQSTM1 is an autophagy-receptor that collects misfolded
proteins into aggregates and links the aggregates to the
forming autophagic membrane [15, 16]. Moreover, the
numbers of IgH- and SQSTM1-containing aggregates were
similar (Figure 1B, 1C), and most of the aggregates were
double positive for IgH and SQSTM1 (Figure 1A).
Treatment of the cells with either carfilzomib
or bortezomib significantly increased the number of
aggregates (Figure 1A-1C) as well as the levels of
ubiquitinated proteins in the cells (Figure 1D). In contrast,
HCQ (Figure 1B, 1C) or BafA1 (data not shown) did not
affect the number of aggregates or protein ubiquitin levels
in the cells, nor did HCQ significantly affect the level
of aggregates seen in the presence of either carfilzomib
or bortezomib. Control experiments showed that HCQ
treatment under similar conditions led to accumulation of
LC3B-II in the cells (Supplementary Figure S2). Taken
together, these observations suggest that autophagy and
lysosomal degradation plays only a minor role in preventing
accumulation of aggregates both in untreated cells and
when proteasomes are inhibited, and that proteasomes
play a decisive role in preventing accumulation of IgH/
SQSTM1-containing aggregates in plasma cells.
In experiments shown in Figure 1, cells were treated
with concentrations of carfilzomib or bortezomib that were
equally toxic to the cells when cell viability was measured
the next day (data not shown). The number of aggregates
observed before cell toxicity could be observed, was not
significantly different in cells treated with carfilzomib
compared to cells treated with bortezomib (Figure 1B,
1C). Thus, with respect to the degree of accumulation of
aggregates upon treatment with proteasomal inhibitors,
no major differences between carfilzomib and bortezomib
were detected.

A. ANBL-6 cells were incubated with and without HCQ (20 μM), carfilzomib (Carf. 15 nM), bortezomib (Bz, 7 nM) as indicated for 13
hrs. Cells were fixed and stained with primary antibodies towards IgH and SQSTM1. DNA was visualized using Hoechst 33342 staining.
Scale bar is 10 μm. The staining pattern was homogenous for the different conditions and the images are representative for more than 300
cells manually inspected in the confocal microscope. B and C. Aggregates in cells shown in (A) were quantified by counting numbers of
aggregates stained with anti IgH (B) and SQSTM1 (C) using automated fluorescence image capture and analysis by the ScanR microscope.
Results are expressed as aggregate/cell as the mean +- SD (Standard Deviation) of 5 independent experiments. A two-way between
groups analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to compare aggregate amounts among the groups. The asterisks indicate p<0.001 in the
comparisons of either untreated or HCQ-treated groups with the other groups. D. Both carfilzomib and bortezomib induce accumulation
of ubiquitinated proteins. ANBL6 (4 left-hand lanes) and INA6 (right-hand lanes) cell lines were treated with 4 nM carfilzomib, 4 nM

The ANBL-6 cells are known to secrete only
immunoglobulin light chain [17]. However, it is clear from
these observations that they also make immunoglobulin
heavy chains that accumulate in SQSTM1-containing
aggregates even in untreated cells (Figure 1). Thus, in
these cells, IgH chains are made but presumably not folded
properly to generate intact, soluble immunoglobulin,
but rather continuously degraded by proteasomes and
collected into aggregates containing SQSTM1 upon
proteasomal inhibition.

without carfilzomib for >9 months, and they still
tolerate significantly higher doses of carfilzomib than
the control cells as shown in Figure 3A. Interestingly,
combining carfilzomib with HCQ reversed most of the
tolerance towards carfilzomib. Furthermore, as shown
in Figure 3B and 3D, INA-6 cells tolerating higher
levels of carfilzomib expressed significantly higher
basal levels of SQSTM1 protein compared to control
cells. Higher SQSTM1 protein levels in the carfilzomibconditioned cells were also reflected in a trend towards
higher SQSTM1 mRNA levels (Figure 3C). Both the
sensitive and tolerant cell lines accumulate SQSTM1
protein levels at approximately the same rate over time
upon lysosomal inhibition (Figure 3D), indicating that
increased SQSTM1 levels in the carfilzomib-conditioned
cells were not due to lower SQSTM1 degradation. Taken
together, these results suggest that myeloma cells can
acquire tolerability to carfilzomib by increasing basal
levels of SQSTM1.
To further see if increased expression of SQSTM1
in INA-6 cells rendered them more tolerant to carfilzomib,
we made cells stably overexpressing SQSTM1 from the
EF1alpha promoter. As shown in Figure 3E, the cells had
approximately four-fold higher levels of SQSTM1 protein,
and as in control cells, the SQSTM1 protein turnover was
dependent on autophagy and lysosomal degradation.
Interestingly, the cells overexpressing SQSTM1 tolerated
significantly higher amounts of carfilzomib (Figure 3F).
Taken together, the results suggest that upregulation
of basal levels of SQSTM1 protein could be sufficient
to mediate resistance towards carfilzomib treatment.
Interestingly, no difference in the turnover of LC3B-II
was observed when comparing the carfilzomib sensitive
and tolerant cells (data not shown). Thus, the ability of
SQSTM1 to homo-polymerize and sequester misfolded
proteins may affect cell survival without a change in the
turnover of LC3B-II via autophagy.

HCQ potentiates the cytotoxic effect of
carfilzomib on several multiple myeloma cell
lines
We hypothesized that proteasome inhibition produces
toxic protein aggregates, and that autophagosomal/lysosomal
breakdown of these ameliorates the cytotoxicity. We tested
if concomitant inhibition of autophagy could potentiate cell
toxicity obtained with proteasomal inhibitors. As shown in
Figure 2, and Table 1, sub-lethal concentrations of HCQ
significantly potentiated carfilzomib-induced apoptosis in 3
out of 4 examined myeloma cell lines. Likewise, Bafilomycin
A1 potentiated carfilzomib toxicity (Supplementary Figure
S1). Surprisingly, HCQ had little effects on bortezomibinduced cell death (Figure 2 and Table 1). At doses above 1520 μM, HCQ alone induced some toxicity in these cell lines.
However, combining higher doses of HCQ with bortezomib
resulted only in additive effects and not in potentiation of
bortezomib toxicity (data not shown). Taken together, the
results indicate that the effect of carfilzomib in these cell
lines can be dependent on autophagic-lysosomal protein
degradation, whereas the effect of bortezomib appears to be
relatively independent on lysosomal activity.
Because HCQ has been reported to not only inhibit
lysosomes, but also to allosterically affect proteasome
activity, we tested the effect of HCQ on isolated
proteasomes either alone or in the presence of carfilzomib
or bortezomib [3]. In line with earlier reported results, we
found that HCQ affected proteosomal protein degradation
alone but only at concentrations above 80 μM (data not
shown). Importantly, low doses of HCQ did not potentiate
the inhibition of isolated proteasomes by carfilzomib,
neither did low doses of HCQ affect bortezomib activity
on proteasomes (Supplementary Figure S1C and data
not shown). Thus, the potentiating effect of HCQ on
carfilzomib activity is not due to potentiation of the
carfilzomib interaction with proteasomes.

HCQ potentiate carfilzomib-induced apoptosis in
primary myeloma cells
To investigate whether the ability of HCQ to
potentiate the effects of carfilzomib is not only confined
to relatively rapidly proliferating cell lines, we also
tested the effects of combining carfilzomib and HCQtreatment on 5 isolates of CD138+ primary myeloma
cells, as previously described [18]. In all patient isolates
tested there was a tendency towards increased cell death
in cells treated with the combination of drugs compared
to cells treated with carfilzomib alone. As expected,
in primary myeloma cells isolated from different
patients, the degree of the potentiating effect of HCQ
on carfilzomib-induced cell death varied (Figure 4A-4E).
However, when the 5 isolates were grouped, the HCQ
induced a highly significant reduction of carfilzomib
IC50 (Figure 4F).

Acquired carfilzomib tolerance in myeloma cell
lines can be reversed by treatment with HCQ
To further investigate mechanisms behind cell
resistance towards carfilzomib we generated INA-6 cells
tolerating high doses of carfilzomib (as described in the
methods-section). These cells have been maintained

DISCUSSION

as mitochondria, endoplasmatic reticulum, ribosomes,
and peroxisomes [11]. The route of degradation of
proteasomes in plasma cells has not been identified, but
the lysosomal pathway was suggested to accomplish
this task in other cell types [19]. Furthermore, proteomic
analysis of the MCF-7 breast cancer cell line recently
indicated the presence of proteasomal proteins within
autophagosomes [20]. A likely route for degradation of
proteasomes is therefore by autophagy and lysosomal
degradation. Alternatively, dysfunctional proteasomes
are dismounted and degraded by functional proteasomes.
This way of proteosomal turnover could happen even in
the presence of a reversible proteosomal inhibitor but
be precluded by irreversible inhibitors. Accumulation
of irreversibly inhibited proteasomes could represent a
cellular stress by itself that synergizes with accumulation
of damaged cellular components that should be turned
over by autophagy. Taken together, the results presented
here points to an important distinction between the effects
of proteasome inhibitors in myeloma cells. However,
further experiments must be designed to uncover the
mechanisms for the apparent differential effects of
proteosomal inhibitors.
The results presented here showing permanently
elevated levels of SQSTM1 in cells made tolerant to
carfilzomib suggest that the inherent plasma cell SQSTM1
protein levels may affect the efficacy of carfilzomib
treatment. SQSTM1 is known as a protein induced by
cellular stress (e.g. the presence of protein aggregates)
driven by the transcription factor NRF2 [21, 22].
SQSTM1 collects misfolded proteins into aggregates on
the forming autophagosome membrane. SQSTM1 protein
levels in myeloma cells could possibly represent a marker
of carfilzomib sensitivity. In malignant plasma cells,
SQSTM1 levels could be affected by several factors such
as nutrient starvation or the degree of protein aggregation
in the cells. The degree of protein aggregation will likely
vary between plasma cell clones dependent on the folding

We here show that HCQ potentiate the cytotoxic
effect of carfilzomib on myeloma cells. Furthermore,
treatment with HCQ could partly reverse carfilzomib
resistance in an in vitro carfilzomib resistance model.
Thus, the combined treatment of carfilzomib and HCQ
should be tested in the treatment of multiple myeloma
patients whereas our results suggest that less might be
gained by combining bortezomib with HCQ.
HCQ is a relatively inexpensive drug that inhibits
autophagosomal fusion with lysosomes [14]. HCQ, being
a weak base, acts by increasing lysosomal pH, and will
thus inhibit not only degradation of cargo delivered to
lysosomes by autophagosomes, but also general protein
degradation in lysosomes. The drug has a well-known
toxicity profile due to its application in treatment of
malaria. However, when combined with an irreversible
proteasome inhibitor such as carfilzomib, new types of
toxicity may occur, and the combined use of these drugs
warrants toxicity studies in myeloma patients.
We demonstrate a close interaction of the two
arms of the protein degradation machinery in myeloma
cells, indicating that autophagic and lysosomal
degradation is critically important when proteasomes
are inhibited with carfilzomib. The differential effects
of inhibition of autophagy that we find in cells treated
with carfilzomib versus bortezomib is indeed puzzling.
Bortezomib and carfilzomib did not differ in their ability
to induce accumulation of IgH- and SQSTM1-containing
aggregates, suggesting that there is no straightforward
relationship between removal of such presumably toxic
aggregates and autophagy. While bortezomib interacts
with proteasomes in a reversible manner, carfilzomib is
an irreversible inhibitor. Thus, there may be a requirement
for removal of irreversibly inactivated proteasomal
proteins in cells treated with carfilzomib. Autophagy is
important for degradation of intracellular organelles such

and solubility properties of the monoclonal heavy and
light chains as well as the ratio of protein synthesis of
heavy and light chains. However, it should be noted that
resistance to carfilzomib likely may arise also by several
other mechanisms than by increased levels of SQSTM1
as shown here.
The lack of synergy by combining bortezomib and
HCQ treatment in vitro as described here is in line with
earlier reported results that actually reported antagonistic
effects of HCQ and bortezomib in some myeloma cell
lines [23]. Based on the in vitro findings here it is unlikely
that combined treatment with bortezomib and HCQ
will be of advantage. During our experiments, a phase
1 clinical trial testing the effect of combining HCQ and
bortezomib in multiple myeloma patients was published
[14]. The combined treatment was tolerated relatively
well by the patients, but presence of HCQ did not increase
the effects of bortezomib in that study. Also there is one
ongoing trial in refractory myeloma patients combining
bortezomib and chloroquine [24]. Taken together, the
results obtained suggest that HCQ should be combined
with carfilzomib, and not with the reversible proteasome
inhibitor bortezomib, in attempts to improve treatment of
myeloma patients.

Carfilzomib tolerant INA-6 cells and SQSTM1
overexpressing cells
INA-6 cells were cultivated in media with an
initial dose of 3 nM carfilzomib. Cells were split twice
every week, and the carfilzomib dose was gradually
increased with about 1 nM/month to a final dose of 10
nM after 6 months. Cells were then maintained in 10
nM carfilzomib for 3 months, and then maintained
in carfilzomib-free medium for 4 weeks before being
subjected to experiments. Control cells were cultivated
similarly but without carfilzomib. The plasmid pENTRSQSTM1 (KanR) was a kind gift from Prof. Terje
Johansen’s laboratory (Molecular Cancer Research Group,
The Arctic University of Norway). The lentiviral vector
pLVX-EF1 alpha-IRES-ZsGreen 1 was purchased from
Clontech (Catalog no. 631982). The gateway cassette was
introduced at the XbaI site in the lentiviral vector. The
sequence for the cassette is available on request. By simple
gateway LR recombination reaction the SQSTM1 gene
was cloned into the lentiviral vector. The empty pLVXEF1 alpha-IRES-ZsGreen 1 vector or the pLVX-EF1
alpha-SQSTM1-IRES-ZsGreen 1 vector were packaged
into viral particles in HEK293T cells, using supporting
plasmids psPAX2, and pMD2.G. Virus particles in
supernatants from HEK293T cells were transduced into

different fields of view were analyzed, corresponding to
approximately 4000 cells counted/well. The images were
analysed by the ScanR Analysis software (Olympus)
estimating the number of cells (based on the nuclear-stain)
as well as the number and intensity of SQSTM1 and IgH
dots within cells. In parallel, identically stained cells were
imaged by confocal microscopy. Confocal images were
captured using a Leica SP8 inverted microscope (Leica
Microsystems, Mannheim, Germany) equipped with a HC
plan-apochromat 63×/1.4 CS2 oil-immersion objective.

Cells were washed with ice cold phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS) and lysed in 8 M urea, 0.5% Triton X-100
and 0.1 M dithiothreitol. The samples were sonicated to
shear DNA before electrophoresis using NuPAGE Bis-Tris
gels with MOPS running buffer (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA,
USA). Gels were blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes,
blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline
with 0.1% Tween 20 (TBS-T) and incubated over night
with primary antibodies as indicated. Primary antibodies
used were; SQSTM1 (cat. no GP62-c, Progen Biotechnik,
Heidelberg, Germany), or mouse anti-SQSTM1 antibody
from BD Biosciences, catalog No. 610832); antiGAPDH (cat. no Ab8245, Abcam, Cambridge, UK).
Blots were washed in TBS-T before incubation for one
hour with HRP conjugated (Dako Cytomation, Glostrup,
Denmark) or IRDye conjugated (LI-COR Biosciences,
Ltd., Cambridge, UK) secondary antibodies. Bands were
detected using SuperSignal West Femto (Thermo Fisher
Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) as luminescence substrate
and Odyssey Fc imager (LI-COR Biosciences). Ratios
between signal strengths in different bands were calculated
using Image Studio software (LI-COR Biosciences).

Cell viability assays

In vitro proteasome assay

Cell death in cell lines and primary myeloma cell
isolates was measured essentially as earlier described [18].
Briefly, cell lines and primary myeloma cells were seeded
in RPMI media containing 2 % human serum and 1 ng/
ml IL-6 (ANBL-6 and INA-6 cells), and incubated with
drugs as indicated for 3 days in the absence or presence
of HCQ, respectively. The viability of the cell lines was
unaffected by 10 μM HCQ whereas this dose resulted in
approximately 10 % cell death compared to control in
some of the primary plasma cell isolates (data not shown).
We therefore show data applying 3 μM HCQ with the
primary plasma isolates. Cell viability were measured
after staining with the apoptotic marker YO-PRO-1 (1
μM, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and nuclear stain
DRAQ5 (2.5 μM, eBioscience, San Diego, CA, USA).
Cell stainings were quantified as earlier described
applying ScanR automated image acquisition and analysis
[18]. INA-6 cells made tolerant to carfilzomib were treated
with carfilzomib in the absence or presence of 20 μM
HCQ over night before analysis of cell viability as earlier
described [18].
CellTiter-Glo (Promega, Madison, WI, USA)
was used to determine cell viability in INA-6 cells
overexpressing SQSTM1. Cells were seeded in 96-wells
plates, treated as indicated, before measurement of
cell viability according to the manufacurer’s protocol.
Luminesence was determined with a Victor 1420
multilabel counter (Perkin Elmer Inc., Waltham, MA,
USA).

Experiments were done according to the assayprotocol for Proteasome-Glo Chymotrypsin-like Cellbased kit (Promega Corporation, Madison, WI, USA, cat.
no G8660), applying purified Human 20S Proteasomes
(Boston Biochem, Cambridge, MA, USA, cat. no E-360050). The experiments were done in 96-well white-wall
luminescence plates, using 1 μg/ml proteasomes in 50 μl
PBS/well. After adding proteasomes/carfilzomib/HCQ,
the plate was incubated at 37°C, 5% CO2. After 1 hour
incubation, 50 μl Proteasome-Glo reagent was added to
wells, after 15 min incubation in RT and luminescence
was read on Victor 1420 multilabel counter (PerkinElmer
Inc., Waltham, MA, USA).

Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using the Prism 4
software. Non-linear regression analysis was employed to
fit the dose response curves and to calculate IC50 values.
Extra sum-of-squares F test was used to test whether IC50
values differed between groups. For statistical analysis
data from at least three independent experiments were
used in each case, with two technical repeats for each
condition. Statistical significance was tested with twotailed Student’s T-test for comparison of two groups. A
two-way between groups analysis of variance (ANOVA)
was used to compare multiple groups. Levels of statistical
significance (p values) are indicated in figures and Table 1.
