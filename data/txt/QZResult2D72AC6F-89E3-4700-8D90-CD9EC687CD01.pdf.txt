ABSTRACT
Treatment with rituximab plus cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine,
and prednisone (R-CHOP) has greatly improved clinical outcomes in patients with
diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) compared with CHOP. The mechanism of
rituximab-induced cell death is poorly understood. We found that rituximab does not
enhance the directly killing efficacy of CHOP, as tested on a panel of DLBCL cell lines.
Rituximab induced a rapid release of HMGB1 (High mobility group protein B 1). This
release is independent of cell death but significantly correlated with an inhibition on
STAT3 activity. In the resting state, HMGB1 co-localizes and interacts with STAT3
in the nucleus of DLBCL cells. Treatment with rituximab breaks this binding and
triggers HMGB1 release. Treatment with R-CHOP but not CHOP significantly increased
plasma HMGB1 and decreased IL-10 concentrations in DLBCL patients compared with
controls. The conditioned medium from rituximab-treated DLBCL cells is able to trigger
dendritic cell maturation, phagocytosis, and IFN-γ secretion by cytotoxic T cells. In
conclusion, our results demonstrate that rituximab induces an inhibition on STAT3
activity, leading to increased HMGB1 release and decreased IL-10 secretion, which
elicits immune responses, suggesting that indirect effects on the immune system
rather than direct killing contribute to elimination of DLBCL.

[3–6]. In some of B-cell malignancies, rituximab alone
can induce high overall response rates and long term
remissions [7, 8]. Despite its undeniable value as a
component of therapy for anti-B cell malignancies, the
mechanisms of action responsible for rituximab’s antitumor effects are not fully understood [9].
Over the last decade, the cell killing modalities
of anti-CD20 antibodies on malignant B-cells were
considered as complement-dependent cytotoxicity,
antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, apoptosis,
inhibition of STAT3 activity, and lysosome permeabilitymediated cell death [3, 9–12]. However, in vitro studies

INTRODUCTION
Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and
follicular lymphoma (FL) are the most common forms
of aggressive and indolent non-Hodgkin lymphomas
(NHLs), respectively. The first-line therapy for DLBCL
and FL is rituximab, a monoclonal anti-CD20 antibody,
plus cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and
prednisone (R-CHOP) [1, 2]. Treatment with R-CHOP
achieved high response rates and led to significant
improvements on overall survival rates in patients with
NHLs compared with those treated with CHOP alone

RESULTS

showed that rituximab is the weakest killer on malignant
B-cells among anti-CD20 antibodies [10, 13, 14]. The
cell-killing modality of rituximab is still elusive. So far,
there is little convincing evidence to show that the antitumor effect of rituximab is mediated by direct killing to
malignant B-cells. Previous reports showed that the antiCD20 antibody-treated lymphoma cells are taken up and
processed by antigen presenting dendritic cells (DCs) with
subsequent cross-presentation of tumor-derived antigens
to T cells [15–17]. This suggests that anti-CD20 antibodies
may have a ‘vaccinal effect’ and exert therapeutic effects
through the induction of an adaptive cellular immune
response. However, the precise mechanism by which the
anti-CD20 antibody induces immune responses is also
unclear.
In recent years a new concept ‘immunogenic
cell death’ (ICD), a cell death modality that stimulates
immune response against dead cell antigens, has drawn
great attention in the field of anticancer therapy. The
immunogenic characteristics of ICD are mainly mediated
by damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), which
include pre-mortem surface exposed calreticulin (CRT),
secreted ATP, and post-mortem released high mobility
group protein B1 (HMGB1) after the exposure to certain
cytotoxic agents. These danger signals are recognized
by antigen-presenting cells such as DCs followed by the
formation of T cell-mediated adaptive immunity [18–22].
HMGB1 is a non-histone chromatin protein and
universally expressed by all nucleated cells. It can be
actively secreted by cells of the innate immune system in
response to pathogenic products and passively released
by injured cells as they succumb to primary or secondary
necrosis [23–25]. Extracellular HMGB1 has emerged as
a key mediator in the regulation of immune responses to
infection and sterile injury [26]. The release of HMGB1
by dying cancer cells is mandatory to license host DCs to
process and present tumor antigens. Extracellular HMGB1
interacts with Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and receptor for
advanced glycation end products (RAGE) on the DCs,
which are involved selectively in the cross-priming of
anti-tumor T lymphocytes in vivo [27, 28]. It has been
reported that the type II anti-CD20 antibody GA101
induces both programmed cell death and HMGB1 release
from Raji lymphoma cell line. The conditioned medium
from GA101-treated cells elicits maturation of DCs [29].
However, Rituximab showed less cytotoxic effect on Raji
cells.
On the basis that rituximab induces immune
response in vivo, we hypothesized that treatment with
rituximab might elicit ICD in malignant B-cells. To test
this postulate, we compared cell death modalities between
CHOP and R-CHOP-treated DLBCL cells and determined
rituximab-induced HMGB1 release from DLBCL cells
in vitro and in vivo. We found that rituximab-induced
HMGB1 release from a panel of DLBCL cell lines is
associated with inhibition of STAT3 activity.

Rituximab does not enhance CHOP-induced cell
death in DLBCL cells
Firstly, we compared the killing efficacies of
R-CHOP and CHOP on malignant B-cells in vitro. Four
DLBCL cell lines, Su-6, Su-8, Su-10, and DoHH2, were
treated with 3 different doses of CHOP and/or 10 μg/ml
of rituximab for 24 hours. Treatment with 20 μg/ml of
CHOP induced a significantly increased PARP cleavage,
a marker for apoptosis. However, there was no significant
difference in the amount of PARP cleavage between
CHOP and R-CHOP-treated cells (Figure 1A and 1B,
Supplemental Figure 1A). The four cell lines showed
differential sensitivities to CHOP or R-CHOP-induced
cell death and cytotoxicity (Figure 1C–1F), but again there
was no statistical difference between the treatment with
CHOP and R-CHOP, as analyzed by ANOVA (P > 0.05).
GA-101, another anti-CD20 antibody, significantly
induced cytotoxicity on DLBCL cells but rituximab failed
to do so (Figure 1G). These results demonstrate that
rituximab may not kill DLBCL cells directly.

Treatment with rituximab induces a rapid
HMGB1 release from DLBCL cells
Using Western blotting, we detected that R-CHOP
but not CHOP induced a significantly increased
HMGB1 release from DLBCL cells after treatment
for 4 hours, without inducing changes in the levels of
HMGB1 expression in these cell lines. CHOP neither
induced nor enhanced rituximab-mediated HMGB1
release (Figure 2A–C and Supplemental Figure 1B).
We monitored rituximab-induced HMGB1 intracellular
shuttling using fluorescent microscopy. In untreated
DLBCL cells, HMGB1 mainly localizes in the nucleus,
although a weak expression of cytoplasmic HMGB1
can be detected. After treatment with rituximab alone
for 4 hours, a strong staining of HMGB1 appeared in
the cytoplasm (Figure 2D). Using Western blotting, we
confirmed that both GA-101 (type-II anti-CD20 antibody)
and rituximab induced HMGB1 release from DLBCL
cells after treatment for 4 hours. An anti-CD3 antibody,
OKT3 could not induce HMGB1 release on DLBCL cells
(Figure 2E and 2F), indicating that induction of HMGB1
release is not a function of generic antibodies.
It was reported that HMGB1 release from
monocytes is associated with lysosome exocytosis [30].
Coincidently, other study found that anti-CD20 antibodies
induce lysosomal permeability in malignant B-cells
[10, 14]. We therefore tested whether rituximab-induced
the release of HMGB1 and cathepsin D, a lysosomal
enzyme, follow the same pattern. Results from fluorescent
microscopy and colocalization analysis showed that
HMGB1 and cathepsin D shared colocalization in

Figure 2G and Supplmental Figure 2A and orange pixels
(pseudo-colored) in Figure 2H. However, the Rr values
decreased from 0.874 to 0.406 after treatment with rituximab
(Figure 2H), indicating a decreased colocalization. We further
co-stained cathepsin D or HMGB1 with cytoplasmic
S6 ribosomal protein. Rituximab-induced cathepsin D
release from the lysosome was restricted inside the cell
(Supplemental Figure 2B) but HMGB1 was released to the
outside (Supplemental Figure 2C). Using Western blotting,
we confirmed that treatment with rituximab alone induced
a release of HMGB1 but not cathepsin D (Supplemental
Figure 2D). Taken together, our results demonstrate for
the first time that rituximab induces HMGB1 release from
live malignant B-cells and this release is unlikely via the
mechanism of lysosomal exocytosis.

that the activities of both STAT3-PS727 and STAT3-PY705
were significantly and negatively correlated with levels of
extracellular HMGB1 (P < 0.01; γ = −0.88 and −0.89).
To further confirm the association between STAT3
and HMGB1, we conducted co-IP to determine the binding
between two proteins using either anti-HMGB1 or antiSTAT3-PY705 antibody. There was a weak binding between
STAT3 and HMGB1 in the control cells. The levels of
binding were increased or decreased upon treatment with
either IL-10 or rituximab (Figure 5A), demonstrating
that rituximab reduced the binding between two proteins.
Importantly, AG490, an inhibitor of JAK2/STAT3,
induced HMGB1 release in a dose and time-dependent
manor (Figure 5B). AG490-induced HMGB1 release can
be inhibited by IL-10 (Figure 5C). Taken together, these
results demonstrate that inhibition of STAT3 by rituximab
breaks the binding between STAT3 and HMGB1. This
could be the cause of HMGB1 release.

Rituximab-induced HMGB1 release and STAT3
inhibition are coupled events

Plasma from R-CHOP-treated patients
show significantly increased HMGB1
and decreased IL-10

The function of HMGB1 in the nucleus is to help
transcription factors and other nuclear proteins bind to
their cognate sites by bending the DNA molecule [31].
One of the cytotoxic functions of rituximab is to inhibit
the activity of transcription factor STAT3 [12]. However,
the functional link between STAT3 and HMGB1 is
unknown. We therefore tested whether rituximab-induced
HMGB1 release is associated with the inhibition of
STAT3. DLBCL cells were treated with rituximab and/or
IL-10, a stimulator for STAT3, and then co-stained with
HMGB1 (red) and either STAT3-PS727 or STAT3-PY705
(green) antibodies (Figure 3A and 3B and Supplemental
Figure 3). In control cells, most STAT3 and HMGB1 were
localized in the nucleus, although weakly expressed in
the cytoplasm. Treatment with IL-10 stabilized nuclear
localization of both STAT3 and HMGB1. Rituximab
induced a shuttling of both STAT3/HMGB1 to the
cytoplasm and HMGB1 release, even in the presence of
IL-10. Using colocalization analysis, it was shown that
IL-10 enhanced but rituximab decreased STAT3 and
HMGB1 nuclear colocalization (Figure 3C).
The correlation between STAT3 activity and
HMGB1 release were quantitatively analyzed by
Western blotting in four DLBCL cell lines. First, we
found that rituximab significantly inhibited STAT3
activity in a time-dependent manor (Figure 4A and 4B
and Supplemental Figure 4A) and it also significantly
inhibited IL-10-mediated STAT3 activation (Figure 4C–E
and Supplemental Figure 4B). Unsurprisingly,
IL-10 inhibited HMGB1 release from both control
and rituximab-treated cells (Figure 4F and 4G). The
association between STAT3 activity and HMGB1 release
were analyzed using Pearson’s correlation method
in combination of data from Figure 4D, 4E and 4G.
Statistical data (Supplemental Figure 5A and 5B) showed

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Using ELISA kits, we quantitatively confirmed
that rituximab induced a significantly increased HMGB1
release and a significantly decreased IL-10 secretion in
DLBCL cell lines (Figure 6A and 6B). To determine
whether treatment with rituximab induces HMGB1
release and STAT3 inhibition in vivo, we compared
HMGB1 and IL-10 concentrations in the plasma of
DLBCL patients before and after treatment with CHOP
(n = 24) and R-CHOP (n = 16). The median levels of
HMGB1 and IL-10 in DLBCL patients plasma were
17.88 ng/ml and 9.49 pg/ml, respectively, and were
higher than previously published normal levels of
HMGB1 <10 ng/ml [32] and IL-10 <3 pg/ml [33]. After
treatment with R-CHOP, HMGB1 levels in the plasma
were significantly increased (Figure 6C) and IL-10 levels
were significantly decreased (Figure 6E) compared with
their untreated samples. However, treatment with CHOP
did not affect the plasma levels of HMGB1 and IL-10
(Figure 6D and 6F). These results further confirmed that
treatment with rituximab induces STAT3 inhibition and
HMGB1 release from DLBCL B-cells.

Treatment with rituximab elicits an immune
response
Extracellular HMGB1 is one of the ICD markers.
We tested whether treatment with rituximab elicits other
ICD markers, such as CRT exposure and ATP release.
Treatment with CHOP or rituximab alone increased
phosphorylation of eIF2α (P-eIF2α), one of the precursors
of CRT exposure (Supplemental Figure 6A). However,
rituximab induced an overexpression of CRT protein

both CD80 and CD83, indicating maturation of DCs
(Figure 7A). To determine phagocytosis, iDCs (treated
with GM-CSF and IL-4 for 5 days) were co-cultured with
DLBCL cells treated with saline, or rituximab for 24 hours
and then, fluorescence microscopy was used to evaluate
the phagocytosis of DCs. DCs activated with rituximabtreated cells showed phagocytosis activity compared
with the control, as shown by double positive, or yellow
colored cells (Figure 7B). Moreover, the co-culture
matured DCs with autologous CD8+ T cells significantly
increased the secretion of IFN-γ by cytotoxic T-cells
compared with the control (Figure 7C). These results
demonstrate that conditioned supernatant from rituximabtreated DLBCL cells can enhance immune response by
inducing maturation and phagocytosis of DCs and upregulate cytotoxic function of T cells.

7-AAD positive (dead) cells were determined by flow
cytometry (BD FACS Canto II, BD, USA). CHOP or

Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8, Beyotime Biotechnology)
according to the manufacturer’s instruction.
Briefly, 5000 cells in 100 μl were seeded in each well in

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Human DLBCL plasma

Determination of ICD markers

Plasma was collected from 40 DLBCL patients,
(Supplemental Table 1) at diagnosis and after treatment
with CHOP or R-CHOP for 2 weeks and stored at −80°C.
DLBCL patients were diagnosed by standard criteria and
treated in Tianjin Cancer Hospital, China during 2014.
Ethical approval for this study was obtained from the
ethics committee of Tianjin Medical University Cancer
Institute and Hospital (Ethic number Ebc2014).

HMGB1 release was qualitatively and
quantitatively determined by Western blotting and
ELISA, respectively [32]. To determine CRT exposure,
the cells were fixed with 0.25% of paraformaldehyde
in PBS for 10 min and blocked with 3% bovine serum
albumin (BSA). After stained with PE-conjugated
anti-CRT antibody for 30 min, PE-positive cells were
determined by flow cytometry. ATP concentration
in the culture medium was performed using an ATP
Determination Kit (Life technologies) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions [37].

Cell lines and cell culture
Human DLBCL cell lines Su-DHL6 (Su-6),
Su-DHL8 (Su-8), and Su-DHL10 (Su-10) were kindly
provided by Professor Anthony Letai (Dana-Farber Cancer
Institute) [34, 35] and the DoHH2 cell line was obtained
from CRUK tissue bank [36]. Cell lines were routinely
cultured in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with
10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (FCS) and 2.0 mM
L-glutamine at 37°C in a 5%CO2 humidified incubator.

Preparation of human DCs and CD8+
T lymphocytes
Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells
(PBMCs) were isolated from healthy donors by FicollHypaque density gradient centrifugation and cultured in
RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% FCS for 2 hours.
DCs, which were generated from the adherent fraction
of PBMCs [38], were cultured for 5 days in RPMI 1640
medium containing 10% FCS, 20 ng/mL human GMCSF, and 10 ng/mL human IL-4 (Biolegend). Culture
medium and cytokines were refreshed in every other day.
On the day 5, the medium was replaced by rituximabtreated conditioned medium or control medium and cell
culture was continued for 24 hours. Autologous CD8+
T lymphocytes were magnetically isolated using CD8
MicroBeads (Miltenyi Biotech, Germany) to obtain purity
≥95% CD8+ T cells. The isolated T lymphocytes were
cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% FCS and
10 ng/mL human IL-2 (Biolegend) and the medium was
replaced every other day [37].

Treatment with CHOP or R-CHOP
The components of CHOP, cyclophosphamide,
doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisolone were purchased
from Sigma. Rituximab (MabThera) and GA101 were
obtained from Roche. The stock solutions for CHOP were
prepared individually and then mixed together according

Supplemental Table 2. Cells were treated with CHOP, or
R-CHOP (CHOP plus 10 μg/ml of rituximab) for 24 or
48 hours to induce cell death.

Cell death and cytotoxicity assays
To determine cell death, cells were stained with
0.5 mg/ml of 7-AAD (KeyGen Biotech) for 10 min and

Immuno-staining and fluorescent microscopy

ELISA quantitative analysis

Cells on slides were fixed and permeabilized with
Cytofix/Cytoperm reagents (BD) and blocked with a
buffer consisting of 0.1% saponin and 5% serum (the type
of serum corresponding to the isotype of the secondary
antibody). Cells were co-stained with a monoclonal and
a polyclonal primary antibody (Supplemental Table 3) for
1 hour at room temperature. After washing with TBST
(TBS containing 0.1% Tween-20), cells were incubated
with Alexa-Fluor conjugated secondary antibodies
(Supplemental Table 4) at 1:100 dilution. Slides were
washed for 3 times with TBST, stained with 50 ng/ml
DAPI (4′, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, Sigma), air-dried
at 4°C in the dark, and mounted in ProLong® Gold antifade reagent (Life Technologies) before being viewed
under Nickon Intensilight C-HGFI fluorescent microscope
(Nickon, Japan) [32].
The anti-tumor phagocytic function of matured
DCs was assessed after DCs or DLBCL cells were
labelled fluorescently with Vybrant™ DiO (V-22886) or
DiI (V-22885) cell-labelling solutions (Life technologies),
respectively. Briefly, DLBCL cells were treated with
rituximab for 4 hours after stained with DiI (1:200
dilution). DiO-loaded immature DCs (Day 5) were
then incubated with the rituximab-treated cells. After
co-culture for 24 hours, the cells were fixed with 4%
paraformaldehyde for 20 min, washed in PBS for 20 min
and mounted on slides and viewed under a fluorescent
microscope. Double positive cells were considered as fully
phagocytozed cells [37].

Concentrations of HMGB1 or IL-10 in human
plasma or conditioned medium were determined by
HMGB1 ELISA kit (IBL International) [32] or IL-10
ELISA kit (Cloud-Clone Corp.), respectively. IFN-γ
secretion from CD8+ T lymphocytes was assessed by
IFN-γ ELISA Kit (Cloud-Clone Corp) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions [37].

Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad
Prism software (version 5.03). For all experiments, at
least 3 independent experiments were performed. Data
are expressed as mean ± SD or median with interquartile
range when variation was high. Significant difference
between two groups with equal numbers was analyzed
by two-sided Student t-tests and those with unequal
sizes were analyzed with the Mann-Whitney U test.
Two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post-hoc test was
used to compare difference between two groups of
data. Correlation between two groups of variables was
analyzed with Pearson’s correlation. All P-values < 0.05
were considered as statistically significant. *, **, and ***
indicate P value < 0.05, 0.001, and 0.0001, respectively.

DISCUSSION
There is accumulating evidence for the hypothesis
that long-term clinical success of anticancer therapy
requires the participation of immune responses to ‘danger’
signals emitted by cancer cells [42, 43]. Dysregulated
immune response confers a worse clinical outcome in
DLBCL patients treated with R-CHOP [44, 45]. Our
present data demonstrate for the first time that rituximab
induces a cell death-independent HMGB1 release which
in turn elicits cytotoxic immune responses. We therefore
propose that rituximab may eliminate malignant B-cells
via inducing immune responses rather than a direct killing.
Treatment with R-CHOP greatly improves overall
survival rates in patients with DLBCL compared with
CHOP. However, our in vitro experiments showed that
treatment with R-CHOP does not kill more DLBCL
B-cells compared with treating with CHOP alone.
Rituximab did not directly induce cell death as tested in
four different DLBCL cell lines. We hypothesized that
rituximab may kill malignant B-cells indirectly and this
led us to determine whether rituximab elicits ICD markers
on malignant B-cells.
We found that rituximab induced HMGB1 release
from intact DLBCL cells. Conversely, treatment with
CHOP induced cell death but not HMGB1 release.
According to the concept of ICD, HMGB1 is released
from dying or dead cells and it is a late event of ICD [18].
Our previous study showed that plasma from chronic

Colocalization analysis
Colocalization analysis was based on the theory that
if two proteins are parts of the same complex, then their
staining intensities should vary in synchrony, whereas if
they are on different complexes or structures, they will
exhibit asynchronous staining. The intensive correlation
analysis (ICA) method was used for determine the levels
of colocalization. Image of (PDM): the Product of the
Differences from the Mean was used to qualitative
analysis of colocalization. The levels of colocalization
were quantitatively expressed by the Pearson’s correlation
coefficient (Rr) using WCIF ImageJ software [39–41].

Co-immuno-precipitation (Co-IP)
Cell extracts were prepared with the RIPA buffer.
200 μg Proteins were incubated at 4°C overnight
with a rabbit anti-STAT3-PY705, a mouse anti-HMGB1
antibody, or a control IgG. The immune complexes were
immuno-precipitated on Protein A/G Plus-Agarose beads
(Santa Cruz), washed for 3 times with TBST, resolved
on 10% SDS gel, and detected with anti-HMGB1 or
anti-STAT3-PY705 antibody, respectively.

lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients has elevated
levels of HMGB1 and the concentration of HMGB1 is
positively correlated with the absolute lymphocyte count,
suggesting that the plasma HMGB1 is released from live
CLL B-cells [32]. However, this is not a phenomenon of
malignant B-cells, because other live tumor cells, such as
colon, gastric and liver cancer cells are also able to secret
HMGB1 [46]. Treatment with R-CHOP increased plasma
HMGB1 concentration in patients with DLBCL. Two of
CHOP’s components, doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide,
have been found as ICD inducers [47]. However, treatment
with CHOP did not induce HMGB1 release, CRT exposure
and ATP secretion. This may be caused by the drug
combination which lowers the dose of each drug. In vitro
experiments showed that rituximab-induced HMGB1
release was detected as early as 1 hour and co-treatment
with CHOP did not enhance HMGB1 release. We propose
that rituximab-mediated HMGB1 release is unique and
cell death-independent process compared with ICD
inducers.
The mechanism of HMGB1 release from a cell is
poorly understood. An early study demonstrated that
HMGB1 secretion from monocytes is via lysosome
exocytosis [30]. Our results showed that rituximab induces
lysosome permeability but not lysosome exocytosis
because HMGB1 release was not accompanied by the
release of lysosomal enzyme cathepsin D. We believe that
it will be a challenge to find out how HMGB1 is released
from live cells.
STAT3 is constitutively activated in DLBCL cells
[48]. It was reported that rituximab is able to inhibit STAT3
activity and IL-10 secretion by a CD20 positive Burkitt’s
lymphoma cell line, 2F7 [12]. Indeed, we confirmed
that treatment with rituximab significantly inhibited the
expression of both STAT3-PS727 and STAT3-PY705, and
secretion of IL-10 in a panel of DLBCL cell lines. We
also found that plasma IL-10 levels were significantly
decreased in R-CHOP treated DLBCL patients. IL-10 is
an immunosuppressive cytokine [49]. Inhibition of IL-10
secretion may contribute, at least partly, to rituximabinduced immune response.
As a nuclear protein, HMGB1 binds to DNA and
some of transcriptional factors, and it is required for gene
transcription [50, 51]. We hypothesized that the active
STAT3 may bind to HMGB1 and stabilize its nuclear
localization. Inhibition of STAT3 by rituximab may
break this binding and cause HMGB1 release from the
nucleus. Our results confirmed that rituximab-induced
STAT3 inhibition is significantly correlated with HMGB1
release. In contrast, stimulation of STAT3 by IL-10
stabilized HMGB1 nuclear localization. HMGB1 shares
same localization with active STAT3 in the nucleus but
segregation occurs when they translocate from the nucleus
to the cytoplasm. Using co-IP, we detected the interaction
between HMGB1 and the active STAT3. IL-10 and
rituximab played either positive or negative roles on this
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

interaction. To consolidate this finding, a JAK2/STAT3
inhibitor, AG490 was used to replace rituximab. As
expected, AG490 induced both dose- and time-dependent
HMGB1 release and this release is associated with an
inhibition of STAT3 activity.
As rituximab neither induces cell death nor elicits
other ICD markers, such as CRT exposure and ATP
release, we propose that rituximab is unlikely an ICD
inducer. Extracellular HMGB1 is known as one of the
maturation factors for DCs [52]. Our results demonstrate
that the conditioned medium from rituximab-treated
DLBCL cells is able to induce maturation of DCs which in
turn present tumor antigen to cytotoxic T cells. Rituximab
alone could not induce maturation of DCs, suggesting that
the immunogenic effect is not due to the activation of Fc
receptor by rituximab.
It is currently unknown how rituximab-induced ICD
is linked with previously proposed mechanism of ADCC.
ICD is the killing mechanism by which DCs and T-cells
are activated by tumor cell antigens and eventually tumor
cells are killed by cytotoxic T-cells and phagocytic cells.
ADCC is the natural killer cells kill antibody-primed
tumor cells [53]. Both ICD and ADCC are immunemediated tumor cell killing, by different mechanisms and
different immune cells. Rituximab-mediated ICD can kill
DLBCL cells and may also enhance rituximab-induced
ADCC.
In summary, this study demonstrates that rituximab
induces a cell death-independent HMGB1 release which is
associated with STAT3 inhibition. Increased extracellular
HMGB1 and suppressed IL-10 secretion elicit cytotoxic
immune response which may eliminate malignant B-cells
indirectly. Our data provide a new understanding on the
mechanism by which rituximab and other anti-CD20
antibodies eliminate malignant B-cells.
