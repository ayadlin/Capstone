ABSTRACT:
Recent studies in cancer metabolism directly implicate catabolic fibroblasts as a
new rich source of i) energy and ii) biomass, for the growth and survival of anabolic
cancer cells. Conversely, anabolic cancer cells upregulate oxidative mitochondrial
metabolism, to take advantage of the abundant fibroblast fuel supply. This simple
model of “metabolic-symbiosis” has now been independently validated in several
different types of human cancers, including breast, ovarian, and prostate tumors.
Biomarkers of metabolic-symbiosis are excellent predictors of tumor recurrence,
metastasis, and drug resistance, as well as poor patient survival. New pre-clinical
models of metabolic-symbiosis have been generated and they genetically validate
that catabolic fibroblasts promote tumor growth and metastasis. Over 30 different
stable lines of catabolic fibroblasts and >10 different lines of anabolic cancer cells
have been created and are well-characterized. For example, catabolic fibroblasts
harboring ATG16L1 increase tumor cell metastasis by >11.5-fold, despite the fact that
genetically identical cancer cells were used. Taken together, these studies provide
>40 novel validated targets, for new drug discovery and anti-cancer therapy. Since
anabolic cancer cells amplify their capacity for oxidative mitochondrial metabolism,
we should consider therapeutically targeting mitochondrial biogenesis and OXPHOS
in epithelial cancer cells. As metabolic-symbiosis promotes drug-resistance and may
represent the escape mechanism during anti-angiogenic therapy, new drugs targeting
metabolic-symbiosis may also be effective in cancer patients with recurrent and
advanced metastatic disease.

Metabolic-symbiosis represents a paradigm shift in
cell biology and cancer metabolism [1-20]. In this simple
metabolic model, catabolic fibroblasts fuel the growth of
adjacent anabolic cancer cells, via energy transfer (Figure
1) [2-4, 7, 12, 13, 15, 17, 19-53]. Catabolic stromal cells
produce high-energy mitochondrial “biofuels”, such as
L-lactate, ketone bodies, glutamine, other amino acids,
and free-fatty acids, for cancer cells to use as substrates
for OXPHOS and as biomass. [38, 40].
Catabolic fibroblasts also show a pro-inflammatory
phenotype, due to oxidative stress and NFkB activation,
which leads to cytokine production. This, in turn, attracts
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

and serves to activate inflammatory cells (macrophages
and neutrophils), which produce more ROS and hydrogen
peroxide species. These findings link inflammation
directly with energy transfer to anabolic cancer cells [2,
41, 42, 54, 55], explaining how inflammation energetically
promotes tumor initiation and cancer progression.
To stringently test the validity of these energy
transfer mechanism(s), stable cell lines of constitutively
catabolic fibroblasts were generated by genetically
increasing glycolysis, ketogenesis, autophagy, mitophagy,
oxidative stress, and/or senescence. This was accomplished
by the recombinant over-expression or knock-down of key

metabolic target genes in hTERT-immortalized fibroblasts.
Similar results were obtained by the genetic manipulation
of either growth factors or extracellular matrix proteins,
indicating that these “signaling networks” also converge
on catabolic metabolism in stromal fibroblasts.
These results are summarized in Table 1, which lists
nearly 30 catabolic fibroblast cell lines that have been
generated, to date [1-20]. Remarkably, these catabolic
fibroblasts [56] effectively promoted tumor growth and/
or metastasis, in pre-clinical animal models (xenografts in
nude mice) [1-20]. Similar results have also been obtained
by using a syngeneic orthotopic animal model, employing
the mammary fat pads of Cav-1 (-/-) null mice, as the
catabolic host microenvironment for tumor growth [57].
Conversely, over-expression of metabolic genes that
drive increased mitochondrial biogenesis or OXPHOS in
epithelial cancer cells, also effectively promoted tumor
growth, and induced autophagy-resistance (Table 1) [4, 8,
18-20].
As metabolic-symbiosis may represent the
underlying basis of drug-resistance [31, 32], and/or
the escape mechanism [35, 43, 44, 47, 48] during antiangiogenic therapy [53], new drugs that target metabolicsymbiosis may prove to be effective in patients with
recurrent cancers and even for the treatment of advanced
metastatic disease [25-27, 35, 43].
The existence of metabolic-symbiosis (a.k.a., twocompartment tumor metabolism) has also been directly
validated in human breast cancer tissue sections, by
employing mitochondrial activity staining in situ. Using
this approach, it is clear that oxidative, mitochondrialrich cancer cell nests, are physically surrounded by

glycolytic, mitochondrial-poor stromal fibroblasts (Figure
2) [58]. Virtually identical results were also obtained with
metabolic protein biomarkers in primary breast tumors and
secondary lymph-node metastases (Figure 3), reflecting a
common organizing principle, with the juxtaposition of
oxidative and glycolytic energetic compartments [52, 59].
As such, tumor architecture also “mirrors” these energybased tumor-stromal interactions.
Remarkably, new studies suggest that normal
adjacent epithelial cells, and stromal adipocytes, can also
serve as functional metabolic partners for anabolic cancer
cells [22, 40, 56, 60]. Therefore, cancer cells may be able
to use many different cell types, in addition to fibroblasts,
as partners to engage in metabolic-symbiosis [52, 61].
Finally, oncogene-transformed epithelial cancer
cells also show significant increases in mitochondrial
mass, which is strictly dependent on oxidative stress [56].
Figure 4 shows that NAC treatment (N-acetyl-cysteine;
an anti-oxidant) dramatically reduced mitochondrial
staining, selectively in Ras-transformed cancer cells,
but not in matched normal control epithelial cells. Thus,
NAC selectively blocks mitochondrial biogenesis in Ras-

Human breast cancer samples (from primary tumors or lymph node metastases) were immuno-stained with antibodies directed against
MCT4 (shown in RED) and TOMM20 (shown in BROWN). MCT4 is a marker of cellular stress, such as ROS production, glycolysis,
and mitochondrial dysfunction, which reflects catabolic metabolism in cancer-associated fibroblasts. Conversely, TOMM20 is a marker
of mitochondrial mass that has been shown to correlate with oxidative mitochondrial metabolism. Note that two distinct metabolic
compartments (oxidative vs. glycolytic) co-exist, side-by-side, in human primary tumors. Virtually identical results were obtained with
metastatic breast cancer lesions, within lymph node tissue. Insets are also shown at higher magnification. Reproduced, with permission,

transformed cells, illustrating how new drug discovery of
more powerful anti-oxidants could be used therapeutically
to “starve” cancer cells. Quantitation indicated that the
mitochondrial marker TOMM20 was decreased by >5-fold
during NAC-treatment [56]. As such, oxidative stress and
ROS production may drive mitochondrial biogenesis in
certain aggressive epithelial cancer cells.
In summary, Table 1 lists >40 validated therapeutic
target(s), related to metabolic-symbiosis, that could
be exploited for new drug discovery. Thus, we should
consider metabolic-symbiosis as a novel conceptual
framework or platform to design more effective anticancer therapies.
