BACKGROUND. Since 1992, pharmaceutical industry support has surpassed
National Institutes of Health funding for clinical research in the United States. In
this study, the authors sought to evaluate the impact of this shift in funding from
public to private sponsors on the nature of published breast cancer clinical
research.

were reviewed from 10 select English-language medical journals to evaluate pharmaceutical involvement over time and the association between sponsorship, trial
medical therapy for breast cancer were eligible for analysis. Pharmaceutical
involvement was defined as reported pharmaceutical industry funding, provision
of drug, and/or authorship for each publication.

RESULTS. In total, 140 eligible studies were identified, including 45 studies that
were published in 1993, 39 studies that were published in 1998, and 56 studies
that were published in 2003. Among those, 67 publications (48%) reported pharmaceutical industry involvement, 36 publications (26%) had at least 1 pharmaceutical industry author, And 100 publications (71%) were considered positive.
Pharmaceutical involvement was identified in 44% of the studies published in
1993, in 38% of the studies published in 1998, and in 58% of the studies published in 2003. Pharmaceutical authorship was reported in 22% of the 1993 studies, in 21% of the 1998 studies, and in 34% of the 2003 studies. For studies that

continued to increase and outpace NIH spending.2 A major focus of
pharmaceutical industry research is the development of new cancer

clinical care increasingly may be influenced by the
pharmaceutical industry-sponsored research.
In recent years, increased investment in oncology research, including collaborations between academic researchers and the pharmaceutical industry,
has yielded new, more effective therapies to fight
cancer.3,4 However, increasing investment and influence of the pharmaceutical industry has raised concerns regarding conflicts of interest and the integrity
of the design, conduct, and reporting of clinical
trials.5–7 These concerns have led to greater oversight
and scrutiny of the clinical trials process and reporting of results.8 Medical journals have established
more stringent requirements for disclosure of financial incentives,9 and a national clinical trial registry
has been established, in part to promote awareness
of unpublished studies and to allow greater scrutiny
of trial conduct and outcomes.10
The growing importance of pharmaceutical
industry involvement in clinical research has led to
efforts to better understand its impact. Previous studies evaluating nononcologic research have revealed
that 1) pharmaceutical sponsorship of clinical research is increasing over time11,12 and 2) pharmaceutical-sponsored studies are more likely to report
positive results than studies without clear industry
connections.13–15 In oncology, there has been only 1
published study evaluating the impact of pharmaceutical involvement on clinical research. This
research demonstrated an association between pharmaceutical sponsorship and positive results in clinical trials for multiple myeloma.16 Several additional
studies evaluating the economics of cancer therapy
also have suggested that the source of funding may
affect research design and outcome.17–19
Breast cancer is the most common cancer in
American women and affects >200,000 women in
the United States20 and as many as 1.1 million
women globally each year.21 Thus, the factors that
affect the nature and quality of breast cancer
research may have a large impact on public health.
To our knowledge, there has been no published
research to date regarding the correlation between
pharmaceutical sponsorship and breast cancer clinical research.
For the current investigation, we sought to identify the extent of documented involvement of pharmaceutical companies in published clinical breast
cancer research and to explore the correlation
between pharmaceutical company involvement and
study design and outcome. We also evaluated
changes in documented pharmaceutical company
involvement in published breast cancer clinical trials
over time.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
We conducted a systematic audit of breast cancer
clinical trials that were published in the years 1993,
1998, and 2003 in 10 select English-language medical
journals to evaluate the correlations between pharmaceutical company involvement, study design, and
study outcome and to explore changes in these areas
over time.

Study Selection
Eligible journals were selected based on the frequency of breast cancer publications in selected
years, as determined by a search of the MEDLINE
database using the index terms breast cancer and
clinical trial, and expert opinion regarding top journals for breast cancer clinical research (see Table 1).
All published articles from the selected journals that
reported original clinical research involving medical
therapy for the treatment of breast cancer and that
reported results for 1 disease-specific outcome
were included in this analysis. Phase I trials, trials of
supportive care agents, and trials that tested surgical
or radiotherapy interventions were excluded. Studies
were identified by a hand search of all volumes of
the chosen journals in the selected years; this was
supplemented by a MEDLINE search using the year
of publication, journal name, and index search terms
to identify potential articles that were missed during
the hand search. Studies were screened for eligibility
by reviewing the title and abstract.
A study-specific abstraction tool was developed
and piloted using breast cancer clinical trials from
nonindex years. A medical oncologist (J.P.) reviewed
and abstracted relevant data from each eligible publication. We also randomly selected 10% of eligible
articles to undergo repeat audit and abstraction by
another oncologist (A.P.) to determine the potential
for miscoding or disagreement over abstraction
items. For 6 select items (pharmaceutical involvement, pharmaceutical authors, study outcome, cancer stage, study design, and size of trial) among 14
articles (10%) there was agreement for 82 of 84
items for a concordance rate of 97.6%. It was determined on review that the 2 differences represented
miscoding.
Definitions of Major Outcomes
Pharmaceutical versus nonpharmaceutical studies
Any indication of pharmaceutical industry involvement in an article, including the provision of drugs,
funding of the study or the investigator, or 1 pharmaceutical industry author(s), meant that it was
categorized as a pharmaceutical study (PS). Lack of

such documented indication of pharmaceutical support meant that the publication was classified as a
nonpharmaceutical study (NPS).

Pharmaceutical industry authorship
Reported author affiliations were reviewed. Studies
that reported 1 author(s) who were affiliated with a
biotechnology company or pharmaceutical company
were classified as having a pharmaceutical industry
author. Disclosures of potential conflicts of interest
through grant support, consultant relationships, or
other connections with the pharmaceutical industry
were not classified as pharmaceutical authorship.
Study outcome
Studies were classified as positive or negative based
on the authors’ conclusions regarding the safety and
efficacy of the intervention compared with standard
therapy. For randomized controlled trials, we classified trials as positive or negative and recorded the
strength of the authors’ conclusions by using the 6point scale developed by Kjaergard and Als-Nielsen.22
This scale allows for the abstraction not only of the
direction of the authors’ conclusion (positive or negative) but also of the strength of statements regarding the merits of the experimental intervention
versus the control. For a random subset of 20 randomized controlled trials from our sample, study outcomes were abstracted by 2 independent reviewers

(A.P. and J.P.) using the 6-point scale. There was
agreement between reviewers on the exact score for
9 of 20 trials (45%). Using scores of 4 through 6 as
evidence of a positive trial and scores of 1 through 3
as evidence of a negative trial, there was 100% agreement between the reviewers regarding whether the
trial was positive or negative. Thus, we used the 6point scale for abstraction purposes but dichotomized the results from the scale as positive or negative only for our analyses. For uncontrolled and for
randomized Phase II studies, we abstracted the
authors’ conclusions regarding the results in terms of
the safety and efficacy of the experimental agent as
it was used in the trial. Because of the varied ways in
which sponsorship may be indicated in published
articles, we did not believe that blinding to the funding source was feasible.

Statistical Analysis
Among all of the studies in our sample, descriptive
statistics were used to characterize the differences in
studies with and without pharmaceutical involvement. The Fisher exact test was used to test the association between pharmaceutical involvement and
study characteristics. The Cochran-Armitage test for
trend was used to determine whether there was a
trend in the proportion of trials that reported pharmaceutical involvement across the 3 years we studied (1993, 1998, and 2003). Because we believed that

the reporting of pharmaceutical sponsorship was
most stringent in later years, we focused our formal
statistical hypothesis tests on the data from trials in
2003.

RESULTS
Eligible Studies
We identified 140 eligible articles from 10 journals.
The journals and characteristics of the articles are
presented in Table 1. Forty-five studies were identified from 1993, 39 studies were identified from 1998,
and 56 studies were identified from 2003. Based on
our definitions of major outcomes, 67 studies (48%)
were categorized as PS, and 37 studies (26%) reported pharmaceutical industry authorship. One
hundred studies (71%) reported primarily positive
results, and 40 studies (29%) reported negative results. The majority of studies were single-arm trials
(55%) and/or concerned the treatment of advanced
disease (69%).
Differences in Studies According to Sponsorship
A combined analysis of all studies from 1993, 1998,
and 2003 demonstrated no significant difference in
the percentage of PS reports that were positive compared with NPS reports (78% [52 of 67 studies] vs
66% [48 of 73 studies]; P ¼ .14). Seventy-nine percent
of PS reports involved the treatment of advanced disease versus 60% of NPS reports (P ¼ .02). In addition,
55% of PS reports were from single-arm studies (vs
randomized Phase II or III studies) compared with
41% of NPS reports (P ¼ .13). Among all of the articles with documented pharmaceutical authorship, 29
of 37 studies (78%) reported positive results compared with 71 of 103 studies (69%) without pharmaceutical authorship (P ¼ .30).
Because the requirements for documentation of
pharmaceutical involvement in published clinical
research changed during the period evaluated, we

conducted additional analyses that focused on the
most recent year (2003) (see Table 2). In 2003, 57%
of all articles (32 of 56 studies) were PS, and 84% of
those studies reported positive results compared with
54% of NPS (P ¼ .02). PS were more likely to report a
single-arm, nonrandomized study design (66% vs
33%; P ¼ .03), and PS trials trended toward being
more likely to involve treatment of advanced-stage
rather than early-stage disease (72% vs 46%; P ¼ .06).
In addition, PS appeared more likely to involve experimental hormone or biologic therapies (50% vs
33%; P ¼ .28), but this difference did not reach statistical significance. Eighty-four percent of the 2003 studies with pharmaceutical authorship were positive
compared with 62% of studies without pharmaceutical authorship (P ¼ .18).

Changes Over Time
The percentage of PS, including those with pharmaceutical authorship, appeared to increase over the
years studied, although the trends were not statistically significant (see Fig. 1). The published studies
that reported positive results in all 3 years are presented in Figure 2 according to pharmaceutical
involvement and pharmaceutical authorship. In all
periods, the majority of both PS and NPS were positive. We also noted several general temporal trends
among breast cancer trials. The percentage of randomized trials increased from 36% in 1993 to 48% in
2003 (P ¼ .23). Hormone therapy trials increased
from 24% of all trials in 1993 to 33% of all trials in
2003 (P ¼ .3); and, by 2003, 8% of trials involved biologic therapy compared with 0% in 1993 (P ¼ .06).
The percentage of studies that enrolled >200 patients
also increased over time. In 1993, only 20% of trials
involved 200 patients; and, by 2003, 57% of trials
involved 200 patients (P ¼ .0002). The percentage
of trials that involved adjuvant or neoadjuvant ther-

apy increased from 16% in 1993 to 34% in 2003
(P ¼ .04).

DISCUSSION
Pharmaceutical industry investment in research
exceeds the entire operating budget of the NIH: It is
rising, and it is focused on the development of cancer therapies. Increased pharmaceutical sponsorship
of clinical research also has been noted among published stroke trials12 and among randomly selected
trials from 5 medical journals.11 Consistent with
these trends, we observed that the majority of the
most recently published breast cancer trials that
were included in our study were sponsored or supported by the pharmaceutical industry. Whether the
increased prevalence of reported pharmaceutical
involvement over time reflects increased involvement
in breast cancer clinical research, more stringent
guidelines for disclosure, or both remains unclear. In
any event, the finding that the majority of published
studies now involve some degree of collaboration
with the pharmaceutical industry makes it important
to understand the influence that such industry involvement may have on the nature and direction of
breast cancer research.
To date, the full consequences of pharmaceutical
industry involvement in clinical research are not well
understood. We observed that clinical studies involving the pharmaceutical industry may differ significantly from those that do not involve the
pharmaceutical industry. Despite our small sample
size, in the subset of 2003 trials, we detected differences both in study design and in study outcome
that may have implications for patients, clinicians,
and policy makers. Documented pharmaceutical
involvement was associated with smaller trials, single-arms studies, and studies that focused on
advanced disease. We also observed that trials pub-

1243

lished in 2003 with pharmaceutical involvement were
significantly more likely to report positive results
than trials without pharmaceutical involvement.
The finding that the pharmaceutical industry
may be more inclined to support or design smaller,
single-arm studies for patients with advanced breast
cancer likely reflects their important role in the development of novel therapeutics. However, there are
many important questions regarding breast cancer
therapy that go beyond identifying active new drugs.
For many proven therapies, the optimal timing,
sequencing, and duration of therapy are unclear.
Similarly, identifying subgroups of patients who are
most likely to benefit or develop toxicity from available therapies and understanding the long-term outcomes from current therapies are critically important
for clinical decision making. Pursuing these questions may not always be in the financial interests of
companies that are selling approved therapies. If
these types of questions are supported by other
funding agencies, then the care of women with
breast cancer will continue to improve. However, if
increased investment by industry leads to curtailed
investment from other funding sources and if pharmaceutical involvement increasingly shapes the
research agenda, then critical questions may be
neglected. Many of these questions have great practical importance and may have important financial
implications for the health care system (eg, the optimal duration of treatment for an expensive new
drug). It will be important to continue to monitor
trends in breast cancer research over time and to be
sure that important clinical questions are not overlooked as pharmaceutical involvement in clinical
research continues to increase.
Our finding that, for 2003 studies, there was a
correlation between pharmaceutical industry involvement in breast cancer research and the publication
of positive trial results is consistent with prior
research on the impact of sponsorship on clinical
research results. The association was noted first by
Davidson et al in 1986, who demonstrated that
industry-sponsored, randomized controlled trials
were significantly more likely to report positive
results than nonindustry-sponsored trials.23 More
recently, Bekelman et al conducted a systematic
review of studies that investigated the impact of financial conflicts of interest on biomedical research.14
Pooled analyses of 8 studies specifically addressing
the impact of sponsorship on research outcomes
demonstrated that industry sponsorship was correlated with positive study outcomes or proindustry
conclusions with an odds ratio of 3.60 (95% confidence interval, 2.63–4.91). In oncology, Djulbegovic

1244

CANCER

et al. reported that randomized controlled trials for
multiple myeloma that were funded by for-profit
organizations were more likely to favor the experimental treatments over control treatments compared
with randomized controlled trials that were sponsored by nonprofit organizations (74% vs 47%).16
Three additional studies that evaluated the economic
impact of trial sponsorship in oncology documented
a similar association between industry sponsorship
and positive results.17–19 It is important to note that
we failed to detect a significant difference between
positive outcomes among PS versus NPS when we
compared trials in all 3 time periods in our analysis
(78% positive among all PS vs 66% positive among
all NPS; P ¼ .14). Further research may be needed to
clarify whether this discrepancy between our combined analysis and both our 2003 data and prior
publications was caused by misclassification bias
during earlier periods for our sample or by a change
in the association between pharmaceutical involvement and outcomes in breast cancer trials over time.
We evaluated the association between PS, singlearm versus multiarm study design, and study outcomes for all years and for the 2003 subsample (Fig. 3).
The significant difference in positive outcomes
among multiarm trials between PS and NPS in 2003
suggests that increased prevalence of single-arm studies among PS is not the sole explanation for the
association between PS and positive study outcomes
during this period.
There are multiple potential explanations for the
association between pharmaceutical industry involvement and positive study outcomes. It is possible
that pharmaceutical trials, whether by development
and selection of better drugs or greater focus on
established therapeutic targets, may be more likely
on average to yield positive results than the experimental interventions tested in nonpharmaceutical
trials. These possibilities have been overlooked in
many discussions of the industry-positive study connection.12,14,16 Alternatively, the pharmaceutical
industry may be more likely to support study designs
that are deemed more likely to yield positive results.
In randomized controlled trials, this could involve
the selection of an inferior control arm or setting up
a straw horse to make the experimental therapy look
better, as suggested by the number of placebo-controlled PS trials versus publicly funded trials in the

study by Djulbegovic et al.16 We reviewed all randomized controlled trials from 2003 in our sample and
observed that the control arms of all trials reflected
appropriate standards of care. Only 1 study compared an experimental therapy with a placebo control; and, in that setting, the standard treatment was
no active therapy, which meant that a placebo was
entirely reasonable.24 However, because the biggest
difference between PS reports and NPS reports
occurs among randomized controlled trials, as
detailed in Figure 3, it remains plausible that PS randomized controlled trials are conducted when there
is a high level of certainty from some aspect of the
trial design or from the selection of control arm therapy that the trial will be positive. An evaluation of
the differences between PS randomized controlled
trials and NPS randomized controlled trials is indicated for future research. It should be noted that
many PS randomized controlled trials may be registration trials, and study design and selection of control arms for these studies will be influenced by U.S.
Food and Drug Administration requirements for drug
development.
It is also possible that the correlation between
positive results and industry funding is an artifact of
differential publication. It is well established that, in
general, positive studies are more likely to be published than negative studies (publication bias).25 PS
with negative results may be even less likely to be
completed, submitted, or published than negative
NPS because of early termination of trials or sponsor
control over publication.7 Future research should
seek to identify the reasons for this association and
the relative contributions of different factors.
The recently initiated national trial registry may
permit an evaluation of the number of trials that are
stopped early or that are completed but never published because of negative results and the degree to
which this number varies based on sponsorship. It
will be important to make the information contained
in these registries available to researchers who wish
to untangle the correlations between sponsorship,
research outcomes, and publication.
There were several limitations to the current
study. We relied on documentation of pharmaceutical involvement to classify a study as PS versus NPS.
Particularly in the earlier periods sampled, when disclosure requirements were less stringent, it is possible that this led to misclassification bias. Because we
classified any report without documentation of pharmaceutical industry involvement as NPS, such misclassification likely would result in an under
estimation of the percentage of trials with pharmaceutical involvement. A further limitation was the

1245

relatively small number of studies identified in each
of the 3 years. Identification of all published breast
cancer trials in a given year or expansion of time
periods to 2-year blocks would have increased our
sample size. Future research should focus on a specific subgroup, such as Phase II studies or adjuvant
trials, and on longer time periods and/or articles
from all journals. There is no established method for
evaluating trends over time in published studies. Our
selection of 3 time periods was arbitrary, and other
methods could yield different results. Our objective
was to make this a hypothesis generating analysis,
and the trends suggested should be evaluated in
larger studies. We selected the most recent year with
complete data at the time of study conception in
early 2004 and wanted to evaluate changes over a
decade at 5-year intervals, which led to the selection
of 1993, 1998, and 2003 as the years of analysis for
the study. The major strength of this study is that,
despite the relatively small sample size, we observed
important differences between published clinical
trials that involved the pharmaceutical industry compared with studies that did not report pharmaceutical involvement. These results are supported by
other studies in this area. To our knowledge, this is
the second study to explore the question of industry
impact on clinical research in oncology and the first
in the area of breast cancer research.
In conclusion, the impact of the growing pharmaceutical industry involvement in breast cancer
clinical research appears similar to the impact of
industry sponsorship documented in other fields of
medical research. The majority of clinical research
currently is associated with the pharmaceutical
industry, and this association appears to have an
impact on research outcomes and may shape study
design. What this association means for the future of
breast cancer research is unclear. It may yield better
therapies for treatment of breast cancer but, at the
same time, may focus research on some clinical problems while neglecting others. Given the importance
of breast cancer as a public health problem and the
current necessity of the pharmaceutical industry as a
supporter of clinical breast cancer research, further
study is needed to evaluate and understand the
impact of industry involvement on research design
and outcomes and, ultimately, to determine the
potential impact on patient care.
