Abstract
Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDIs) and HAMLET (human Alactalbumin made lethal to tumor cells) interact with histones,
modify the structure of chromatin, and trigger tumor cell
death. This study investigated how the combination of HDIs
and HAMLET influences cell viability, histone acetylation, and
DNA integrity. The pretreatment of tumor cells with HDIs was
shown to enhance the lethal effect of HAMLET and the histone
hyperacetylation response to HDIs increased even further
after HAMLET treatment. HDIs and HAMLET were shown to
target different histone domains as HAMLET bound tailless
core histones, whereas HDIs modify the acetylation of the
histone tail. DNA damage in response to HAMLET was
increased by HDIs. The DNA repair response (p21WAFI
expression) was induced by both agonists but abolished when
the two agonists were combined. The results suggest that the
synergy of HDIs and HAMLET is based on different but
converging death pathways, both involving chromatin alterations. We speculate that HAMLET and HDIs might be
combined to promote tumor cell death in vivo. [Cancer Res

Introduction
The chromatin undergoes constant structural modifications in
living cells, and this dynamic process is essential in controlling
gene expression. In eukaryotes, the transcription process is tightly
controlled, mainly by the access of transcription factors to the
target DNA. Nucleosomes are basic structural elements of
chromatin consisting of 146 bp of DNA and a histone octamer
formed by H2A, H2B, H3, and H4. The chromatin structure is
modified by histone phosphorylation, methylation, acetylation,
ubquitination, and sumoylation and those posttranslational
modifications form the basis of the ‘‘histone code’’ (1). Specifically,
deacetylated chromatin is compact but histone acetylation has
been shown to open the chromatin and to increase the access of
transcription factors to DNA. Histone acetylases and histone
deacetylases (HDACs) regulate the acetylation or deacetylation of
lysine residues in the histone tails (1). Increased histone acetylation
attenuates the electrostatic interaction with the negatively charged
bases, and decreases the interaction of the histones with DNA,

thereby facilitating the access of transcription factors to target
genes (2).
HDACs have emerged as molecular targets for the development
of enzymatic inhibitors to treat human cancer. HDACs are
generally overexpressed in tumors and promote tumor cell
longevity by blocking the transcription of antitumoral genes (2).
Many HDAC inhibitors (HDIs) are currently used in vivo because of
their activity against many human malignancies. For example,
Trichostatin A (TSA) and Vorinostat (also known as suberoylanilide
hydroxamic acid or SAHA) are active against breast cancer and
prostate cancer both in vivo and in vitro (3, 4), and early phase I/II
trials showed that Romidepsin might be useful in the treatment of
T cell lymphomas (5). In addition, HDIs have been shown to
enhance the activity of other antitumoral drugs in cancer therapy.
The mechanism is not fully understood, but the effect has been
shown to be additive or synergistic, suggesting that different
catalytic pathways may be involved.
HAMLET (human a-lactalbumin made lethal to tumor cells) is
a molecular protein-lipid complex with tumoricidal activity (6).
HAMLET is formed from human a-lactalbumin, which is the major
protein in human milk (7–9). To produce HAMLET, a-lactalbumin
is partially unfolded and bound to oleic acid during an ion
exchange chromatography process (8, 9). The protein and lipid are
both required for tumoricidal activity and structural studies have
suggested that HAMLET represents a new type of cytotoxic entity.
HAMLET triggers tumor cell death in vitro (10–12) but does not kill
healthy differentiated cells, and in vivo studies have shown that
HAMLET is active as a topical agent against skin papillomas (11)
and bladder cancers (13). The mechanism(s) of cell death are not
fully understood, but HAMLET is rapidly internalized by tumor
cells and is translocated to the nuclei, where it accumulates (14).
We have identified histones H3, H4, and H2B as HAMLET receptors
in the nuclei, and showed that high-affinity interactions between
HAMLET and histones perturb the chromatin structure in living
tumor cells (14). The interaction of HAMLET with chromatin was
proposed to mark the irreversible phase of tumor cell death in
response to HAMLET. HAMLET and HDIs thus share the ability to
alter the structure and function of chromatin.
This study examined if HDIs modify the cell death response to
HAMLET. We also investigated if histone acetylation is modified
after HAMLET treatment. The results show that HDIs and
HAMLET in combination promote cell death and histone
acetylation, and suggest that it might be useful to combine the
substances in vivo.

Figure 1. HAMLET and HDIs trigger tumor cell death. A, loss of cell viability, quantified by flow cytometry after propidium iodide staining. Jurkat cells were
pretreated with TSA (330 nmol/L, 3 or 18 h) and then exposed to HAMLET (HL , 0.15 mg/mL, 3 h). Flow cytometry analysis of the enhanced cell death response to
HAMLET and TSA. The proportion of dying cells (sub-G1) and living cells (G1, S, G2) is indicated above the superscript line. Results from one of three experiments.
B, concentration-dependent increase in Jurkat cell death. TSA pretreatment (165, 330, or 660 nmol/L, 3 h) followed by HAMLET (0.1, 0.2, and 0.3 mg/mL, 3 h).
The sub-G1 population was quantified by flow cytometry (left). Concentration effect calculations (right) of the amount of HAMLET required to kill 30% of the cells at
different TSA concentrations. C, effect of HAMLET pretreatment on the response to TSA. Jurkat cells were pretreated with HAMLET for 3 h, followed by TSA for
3 or 18 h. The sub-G1 population was quantified by flow cytometry (n = 3). After 3 h, cell death was only caused by HAMLET. After 18 h of TSA treatment, the effect on
cell death was additive. Bars, SD.

Protease inhibitors were from Roche Applied Science. Polyvinylidene
difluoride membrane (Immobilon-P) was from Millipore. Amplification
grade DNase I was from Invitrogen. Primers were purchased from
SuperArray Bioscience Corporation.4 HAMLET was produced from native
purified human milk a-lactalbumin on an oleic acid–conditioned ion
exchange matrix as previously described (8).
Cell culture. HeLa and Jurkat cells from the European Cell Culture
Collection were cultured as previously described (9). HeLa cells were grown
in DMEM with glutamax supplemented with penicillin (100 units/mL)/
streptomycin (100 Ag/mL), sodium pyruvate (1 mmol/L; Invitrogen), and
10% FCS, and for cells expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP)–tagged
histones, 2 Ag/mL of blasticidin S (Invitrogen).
Confocal microscopy. HeLa cells were grown in Lab-Tek Chamber
slides and exposed to HAMLET or TSA as previously described (14). Cells
were analyzed in an LSM 510 META confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss,
Germany; 63). The frequency of each chromatin pattern shown is given
after counting a minimum of 30 cells.
Flow cytometry. Harvested cells were fixed in 75% ice-cold ethanol (in
PBS) for 2 h, centrifuged, washed with PBS, and treated with 0.25% Triton
X-100 for 10 min at room temperature, incubated 30 min in swine serum
(1% in PBS), and for 3 h with anti–acetyl histone H4 or anti-phosphorylated
Ser139 histone H2AX (clone JBW301) antibody (1:200, at room temperature).
Cells were incubated with FITC anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (1:20
in PBS and 1% bovine serum albumin for 2 h), washed, resuspended in
2.5 Ag/mL of propidium iodide and 250 Ag/mL of RNase A in PBS, and
incubated at 4jC overnight. Fluorescence intensity values FL2-A and FL2-W
were quantified in a FACScalibur (Becton Dickinson). Red and green emissions from each cell were separated and quantified using standard optics.

Histones. Tailless Drosophila melanogaster histones were expressed in
Escherichia coli, purified, and then assembled into octamers (15). The fold
and functional integrity of the histones were confirmed by nucleosome
assembly on DNA (data not shown). DNA-A 256-bp fragment containing a
sea urchin 5S RNA gene (16) was gel-purified from an EcoRI or NciI digest of
plasmid pLV405-10 (17). The DNA was end-labeled with [g-32P]ATP
(Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Mixtures were analyzed by electrophoresis.
DNA fragmentation. High molecular weight DNA fragments were
detected by field-inversion gel electrophoresis (FIGE). Briefly, cells (2  106)
were embedded in low-melting agarose gel treated by proteinase K. Samples
were run by electrophoresis at 180 V in 1% agarose gels in 0.5 TBE (45
mmol/L Tris, 1.25 mmol/L EDTA, 45 mmol/L boric acid; pH 8.0) at 12jC,
with the ramping rate changing from 0.8 to 30 s for 24 h, using a forward to
reverse ratio of 3:1. Quantification of high molecular fragmented DNA bands
was performed using ImageJ software.
Immunoblot. Jurkat cells were extracted in ice-cold PBS and lysed [20
mmol/L Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 100 mmol/L NaCl, 5 mmol/L MgCl2, and 0.5%
Nonidet P40] supplemented with protease inhibitors. Fifty micrograms of
protein extracts were separated, electrotransferred onto a polyvinylidene
difluoride membrane, and incubated with anti-p21waf1 polyclonal antibodies (1:2,000) or anti-CPP32 (1:1,000) overnight at 4jC. Goat anti-rabbit
antibodies (horseradish peroxidase–conjugated 1:10,000; Dako) were then
applied for 1 h at room temperature. Immunoreactive bands were revealed
by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham).
Reverse transcription-PCR. RNA was DNase-treated with DNase I,
cDNA were synthesized using the SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis
System for RT-PCR (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions, except that both random hexamers and Oligo(dT)20 were mixed in the
annealing step. Semiquantitative real-time PCR (RT-PCR) used RT2 realtime SYBR Green technology from SuperArray Bioscience Corporation4 and
SmartCycler II apparatus (Cepheid). Expression of target genes was

measured after normalization against glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and values were expressed as the fold increase using the CT
method.

Results
Effects on tumor cell death. The effects of TSA and HAMLET
on cell viability were examined by flow cytometry after propidium
iodide staining of nuclear DNA. Cells in the sub-G1 population were
identified and defined as dead or dying by apoptosis (18). Cell

were pretreated with TSA (330 nmol/L, 3 or 18 h) and then exposed to HAMLET
(0.15 mg/mL, 3 h). The increase in histone H4 acetylation was quantified by
flow cytometry after staining with specific antibodies. Results from one of four
experiments. A, histone H4 acetylation levels increase synergistically after TSA
pretreatment followed by HAMLET. B, acetylation in dying (sub-G1) or intact

viability was also assessed by trypan blue exclusion. Jurkat cells
were first exposed to 330 nmol/L of TSA for 3 or 18 h. The longer
exposure time increased the sub-G1 population from 2.8% in the
control to 26.1% in TSA-treated cells (P < 0.01; Fig. 1A) but the
shorter exposure time had no effect (3.7% in TSA-treated cells, not
significant). By trypan blue exclusion, the longer TSA exposure
was shown to kill 30.2% of the cells compared with 5.3% in the
control (P < 0.01), but after 3 h, TSA had no effect on cell viability
(6.0% in TSA-treated cells, not significant; Supplementary Fig. S1A
and B).
Jurkat cells were subsequently exposed to HAMLET, and the
effect on viability was examined (Fig. 1B). A HAMLET concentration below the LD50 was selected (0.15 mg/mL) and the cells were
incubated for 3 h. The short HAMLET exposure time was sufficient
to increase the sub-G1 population from 2.8% in the control to 7.7%
(P < 0.05), and by trypan blue exclusion, 20% of the cells had died
(P < 0.05; Supplementary Fig. S1B). The increase in the sub-G1
population was directly proportional to the decrease in the G1 peak
(28.9% in the control to 22.9% in HAMLET-treated cells). The
results show that the death response to HAMLET was direct and
more rapid than the response to TSA.
To examine the combined effect of HAMLET and TSA, Jurkat
cells were pretreated with TSA (330 nmol/L, 3 h) and exposed to
HAMLET (0.15 mg/mL, 3 h). The combined treatment killed a
significantly higher number of cells than either agonist alone
(Fig. 1A). The sub-G1 population increased from 2.8% in the
control to 14.6% in the TSA/HAMLET-treated cells (P < 0.01,
compared with HAMLET or TSA). The response to HAMLET was
further enhanced by longer TSA pretreatment. After 18 h of
pretreatment, HAMLET killed 51.4% of Jurkat cells compared with
26.1% for TSA alone and 7.7% for HAMLET alone (Fig. 1A). Similar
results were obtained when trypan blue exclusion was used to
quantify cell death. The combined treatment killed 41% of the
cells, compared to 6% and 30% for TSA alone at 3 h and 18 h,
respectively, and 25% for HAMLET treatment (P < 0.01, Supplementary Fig. S1A).
The dose-dependent cell death response is shown in Fig. 1B. In
addition to flow cytometry, ATP levels were used to quantify cell
death (19). TSA pretreatment increased the lethal effect of
HAMLET at concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 0.3 mg/mL. By
concentration effect calculations, the effect was shown to be
synergistic as a lower concentration of HAMLET was required to
kill TSA-pretreated cells [decrease from 0.18 to 0.12 mg/mL (660
Amol/L TSA) to kill 30% of cells using sub-G1 quantification
(Fig. 1B) and from 0.26 to 0.18 mg/mL to kill 40% of cells using ATP
levels; Supplementary Fig. S1C]. The results show that HAMLET
and TSA promote cell death in a synergistic manner when TSA is
given first.
To investigate if TSA and HAMLET act independently, the order
of the agonists was changed. Jurkat cells were pretreated with
0.15 mg/mL of HAMLET for 3 h, followed by TSA for 3 or 18 h
(Fig. 1C). TSA had no effect on cell viability at 3 h. HAMLET
pretreatment followed by TSA treatment for 18 h further reduced
cell viability compared to HAMLET alone, however, and a lethal
effect of TSA alone was observed at 18 h. After concentrationmedian calculation, we conclude that this effect was additive
(data not shown). The results suggest that a synergistic effect on
cell death is achieved only when HDIs are given before HAMLET.
Effects on histone acetylation. HDIs increase histone acetylation by preventing HDAC activity (20). The effect of HDIs and
HAMLET on histone acetylation was analyzed by flow cytometry in

Figure 3. Nuclear morphology in cells treated with HAMLET and TSA. Confocal

Jurkat cells, using antibodies specific for acetylated histone H4. Cells
were pretreated with TSA (330 nmol/L, 3 or 18 h) and exposed to
HAMLET (0.15 mg/mL, 3 h; Fig. 2). The responses to the combined
treatment and to each agonist were compared. TSA increased
histone H4 acetylation in a time-dependent manner. A significant
increase above background levels had occurred after 3 h (P < 0.001),
with a further increase after 18 h (P < 0.001 compared to 3 h, Fig. 2A
and B; Supplementary Fig. S2A). These results were confirmed by
using Vorinostat (Supplementary Fig. S2B). Three different concentrations of TSA were tested (165, 330, and 660 nmol/L). The
maximum hyperacetylation response to HDIs was reached at the
lowest TSA concentration (165 nmol/L, 3 h; Fig. 2C). The results
confirmed the known hyperacetylation response to HDIs.
HAMLET treatment per se did not stimulate acetylation in Jurkat
cells (Fig. 2) but in combination with TSA, an increase in
hyperacetylation was observed (P < 0.001 compared with TSA
alone). Hyperacetylation increased further when HAMLET was
combined with increasing TSA concentrations (P < 0.001, Fig. 2).
The results show that HAMLET increases the histone hyperacetylation response to HDIs and that this effect is TSA
concentration–dependent.
Acetylation in intact and dying cells. To examine if cell death
was influenced by hyperacetylation, intact and dying Jurkat cells
were compared. Apoptotic cells in the sub-G1 population were
identified by propidium iodide staining of nuclear DNA and H4
acetylation by specific antibody staining and examined by twodimensional flow cytometry (Fig. 2B). The sub-G1 control cells
showed a lower degree of acetylation than living cells (P < 0.001)

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (23). December 1, 2007

but TSA pretreatment increased the acetylation of both the sub-G1
population and the intact cells (Fig. 2A and B). This effect was
especially pronounced after 18 h.
HAMLET treatment increased hyperacetylation in TSA-treated,
intact cells (P < 0.001, compared with TSA alone; Supplementary
Fig. S2A). When dying cells were included, HAMLET/TSA
treatment had an effect on acetylation after 3 h but not after
18 h (Fig. 2A and B). Time course experiments to dissociate
acetylation from apoptosis showed that they occurred in parallel
but that acetylation decreased during the fragmentation of the
cells, prior to the sub-G1 accumulation (data not shown). The
results show that living and dying cells share the hyperacetylation
response to TSA and HAMLET, suggesting that the effects on
acetylation and death occur sequentially.
To investigate if TSA and HAMLET act independently on
acetylation, the order of the agonists was changed (Fig. 2D). Jurkat
cells were pretreated with 0.15 mg/mL of HAMLET followed by
330 nmol/L of TSA for 3 h. There was no increase in acetylation
after 3 h but HAMLET was shown to antagonize TSA hyperacetylation (Fig. 2D). The results show that a combined effect of
TSA and HAMLET on acetylation is observed only when cells were
exposed to TSA before HAMLET. This implies that TSA exposes
targets for HAMLET, whereas targets for TSA are unavailable after
HAMLET binding.
Chromatin topology, visualized by confocal microscopy. The
effect of HAMLET and TSA on chromatin topology and nuclear size
was analyzed by confocal microscopy using stably transfected HeLa
cells expressing histone H4-GFP. TSA treatment (330 nmol/L, 4 h)
caused a slight increase in nuclear size (P < 0.05), whereas
HAMLET decreased the nuclear size (P < 0.001; Fig. 3). A similar
decrease occurred when the cells were exposed to TSA followed by
HAMLET (P < 0.001 compared with TSA alone or control). The
results suggested that TSA treatment opens the chromatin,
whereas HAMLET causes chromatin condensation. These observations are compatible with the known ability of HDIs to open up
chromatin (20), and with the nuclear condensation in HAMLETtreated cells (12).
HAMLET and TSA target different histone domains. HDIs
and HAMLET have each been shown to modify the structure of

of radiolabeled 146 bp DNA fragments and recombinant tailless histones. In
the absence of HAMLET, no nucleosomes were formed (lane 1 ). HAMLET
triggered nucleosome assembly resulting in one single nucleosome species
(N, lane 2 ). The band intensity increased with higher HAMLET concentrations,

(lanes 3–7 ). HAMLET also dissolved the unspecific histone-DNA aggregates (A );

HAMLET and HDAC Inhibitors Work Synergistically

Figure 5. Effect of HDIs and HAMLET on DNA
damage. A, increase in the number of cells
with DNA damage after HAMLET treatment of
TSA-pretreated cells. Jurkat cells were pretreated
with TSA (330 nmol/L, 3 or 18 h) and then exposed
to HAMLET (0.15 mg/mL, 3 h). The increase in
phosphorylation of Ser139 of histone H2AX was
quantified by flow cytometry after staining with specific
antibodies. Cells were defined as dying (sub-G1)
or intact (G1, S, G2), as determined by a density
plot with the DNA content on the Y-axis and the
phosphorylated histone H2AX on the X -axis.
Results from one of three experiments.
B, accumulation of large DNA fragments in Jurkat cells

chromatin in tumor cells. HDIs bind to HDACs, which target the
histone tail (1). HAMLET also binds to histones, but the more exact
binding specificity is not known. We therefore investigated if the
interaction of HAMLET with histones requires the histone tail. For
this purpose, mutant D. melanogaster core histones lacking the
NH2-terminal histone tails were constructed by deletion of the
sequences encoding residues preferentially cleaved from nucleosomal histones by trypsin but leaving behind the intact globular
domains. The tailless histones were expressed in E. coli, purified,
and then assembled into octamers (ref. 15; Fig. 4). Histone
assembly on the 146 bp fragments resulted in the formation of
nucleosomal core particles (Fig. 4, band N), similar to those
observed with control histones (14). The results show that
HAMLET binds histones independently of the histone tail,
confirming that HAMLET and TSA target different histone
domains.
Phosphorylated H2AX and DNA fragmentation. DNA damage was quantified as the phosphorylation of Ser139 of histone
H2AX by two-dimensional flow cytometry, as previously described

www.aacrjournals.org

(21). Phosphorylated H2AX staining was rare in control cells
(4.04%) and in TSA-treated cells (330 nmol/L, 3 h; 6.60%). In
contrast, HAMLET induced an increase in phosphorylated H2AX
staining (21.30%, P < 0.01). The increase was mainly seen in cells
with low DNA content, corresponding to the sub-G1 population
(Fig. 5A). When cells were pretreated with TSA for 3 h, a further
increase of phosphorylated H2AX (29.21%, P < 0.05) was observed
in sub-G1 as well as in G1 cells.
DNA damage was further examined by FIGE as previously
described (22). The accumulation of high molecular weight DNA
fragments was recorded (294 and 48 kb; Fig. 5B). HAMLET
treatment (0.15 mg/mL, 3 h) increased the formation of 294 kb
fragments by 2.8-fold compared to the control. A 7-fold increase
was detected after TSA pretreatment (330 nmol/L, 3 h), and
compared with controls, a 12-fold increase occurred after
Vorinostat pretreatment (2.5 Amol/L, 3 h). The 48 kb DNA
fragments were only observed after combined HDI/HAMLET
treatment. These results show that HAMLET alone induces DNA
damage and that this effect is enhanced by HDIs.

increase in p21WAF1 expression, consistent with DNA damage (27).
TSA pretreatment induced a 2.7-fold increase in p21WAF1
expression, consistent with chromatin relaxation (28). The increase
in p21WAF1 expression was blocked by the combined treatment
with TSA followed by HAMLET, as shown by Western blot (Fig. 6A)
and by RT-PCR (Fig. 6B). The results show that HAMLET and TSA
each trigger a p21WAF1 response, which is inhibited in the
presence of both agonists.
To examine if the reduction of p21WAF1 expression was due to
caspase cleavage, Jurkat cells were pretreated with zVAD (50 Amol/
L, 30 min), incubated with TSA (330 nmol/L, 3 h) and then exposed
to HAMLET (0.15 mg/mL, 3 h; Fig. 6C). HAMLET and TSA/
HAMLET induced CPP32 cleavage (caspase 3 native; lines 2 and 4)
and zVAD blocked this cleavage (lines 6 and 8). p21WAF1
expression was enhanced by HAMLET in the presence of the
zVAD (line 6) but was reduced when both agonists were combined
(line 8). The results show that the p21WAF1 response to HAMLET
and TSA is caspase-independent.

Discussion

Figure 6. Effect of HDIs and HAMLET p21WAF1 expression. A, enhanced
p21WAF1 expression in response to TSA or HAMLET but reduced expression
when both agonists were combined. Jurkat cells were pretreated with TSA
(330 nmol/L, 3 h) followed by HAMLET (0.15 mg/mL, 3 h) and p21WAF1
expression was analyzed by Western blot (quantified using ImageJ software).
Results are the fold increase above the control. B, p21waf1 expression
was disrupted by the combination of both agonists (RT-PCR, p21WAF1/
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase fold increase above the control;
columns, mean of three independent triplicates), bars, SD. C, p21WAF1
expression is not rescued by caspase inhibitors. Following zVAD preincubation
(50 Amol/L, 30 min), Jurkat cells were first pretreated with TSA (330 nmol/L,
3 h) and then exposed to HAMLET (0.15 mg/mL, 3 h). The levels of p21WAF1
were decreased by TSA and HAMLET even when caspases were inhibited
(one of two typical experiments).

Combination of HAMLET and HDIs disrupts p21WAF1
expression. p21WAF1 or CDKN1A acts as a regulator of cell cycle
progression at the G1 checkpoint and is mutated or epigenetically
down-regulated in many cancers (23, 24). p21WAF1 is a potent
cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, which binds to and inhibits the
activity of cyclin-CDK2 or cyclin-CDK4 complexes and causes a
rapid G1-S arrest. TSA treatment has previously been shown to
restore p21WAF1 expression in Jurkat cells and to limit tumor cell
progression (25). In addition, the lethality of HDIs is inhibited if
p21WAF1 expression is induced, possibly through a mechanism
involving the inhibition of the apoptotic caspase cascade (26),
which p21WAF1 has been shown to block.
To examine if HAMLET and TSA might influence p21WAF1
expression, Jurkat cells were treated with HAMLET (0.15 mg/mL,
3 h) or with TSA (330 nmol/L, 3 h) and p21WAF1 was quantified by
Western blots or by RT-PCR (Fig. 6A). HAMLET induced a 2-fold

Both HDIs and HAMLET modify the structure of chromatin and
trigger tumor cell death. HDIs trigger tumor cell death by restoring
the expression of antitumoral genes, whereas HAMLET binds
histones with high affinity and alters the chromatin structure. This
study compared the effects of HDIs and HAMLET on tumor cell
viability, histone acetylation, and DNA integrity when the agonists
were combined. HDI pretreatment caused a marked increase in the
death response to HAMLET and HAMLET a further increase in
the histone hyperacetylation response to HDIs. Cell death was
accompanied by increased DNA damage and decreased p21WAF1
expression when the two agonists were combined. We propose that
the synergy is based on different but converging death pathways,
which involve alterations of the chromatin. As HDIs and HAMLET
have documented therapeutic effects, the combined use of
HAMLET and HDIs might be of value in the treatment of cancer.
Tumor cell death increased markedly when HDIs and HAMLET
were combined and the effect was synergistic when TSA was added
before HAMLET. The molecular basis of this synergy is unclear, but
several death pathways may be discussed. Caspases are essential
for the execution of apoptosis and HDIs have been proposed to
trigger cell death via the extrinsic, death receptor–dependent
pathway and via the intrinsic mitochondrial death pathway
through activation or inhibition of specific Bcl-2 family members,
via the regulation of reactive oxygen species and via cell cycle arrest
( for a review, see ref. 2). HAMLET acts directly on the mitochondria
and triggers an effector caspase response and the nuclear caspase 2
response to HAMLET may contribute to further mitochondrial
activation (12). The death of HAMLET-treated cells is caspaseindependent, however (9, 12). In the present study, the DNA
damage response was shown to be caspase-independent, further
supporting the notion that classical apoptosis is not the key to the
combined effect of HAMLET and TSA.
TSA facilitated the lethal effect but HAMLET seemed to
dominate the execution of the death response. Cells subjected to
the combined treatment showed rapid HAMLET-like death kinetics
and the chromatin condensation pattern was characteristic of
HAMLET-treated cells. HDIs have been shown facilitate the access
of other compounds to the chromatin and we speculate that the
synergistic effect of HAMLET and TSA might reflect the increased
accessibility of histones to HAMLET binding (20, 29). We detected

HAMLET and HDAC Inhibitors Work Synergistically

an increase in nuclear size after TSA pretreatment, but a
condensation after HAMLET treatment, consistent with the highaffinity interactions that occur between HAMLET and chromatin.
When HAMLET was given first, there seemed to be a reduced
accessibility of histone tails for the HDIs, suggesting that the
changes in chromatin structure cannot be reversed by TSA. This
might explain why TSA had no effect on cell death when HAMLET
was added first.
Tumor cells reduce the expression of antitumoral genes by sitespecific histone hypoacetylation and by hypermethylation of
promotor sequences. HDIs restore gene expression by enhancing
the acetylation of histones and by selective DNA demethylation of
previously silent antitumoral genes (30). In this study, the histone
acetylation response to TSA was confirmed, but HAMLET was
found to increase acetylation even further when combined with
TSA. To our knowledge, HAMLET is the first example of a
compound that increases the hyperacetylation response to HDIs. In
previous studies, HDIs have been combined with compounds such
as sysplatin and etoposide or with UV irradiation, but no further
increase in acetylation has been reported. The combined effect of
HDIs and HAMLET was only observed when the cells were
pretreated with TSA, but the reverse was not true, as HAMLET
pretreatment was shown to partially block the acetylation response
to TSA. The combined effect on acetylation cannot be explained,
at present, but several mechanisms may be discussed. HAMLET
might increase acetylation by activating histone acetylases or
endogenous deacetylation inhibitors (like butyrate) or by inhibiting
deacetylation by releasing HDACs from chromatin. HAMLET
binding to the histone core rather than the tail may cause a
compensatory increase in acetylation. Previous studies have shown
that histone acetylation correlates with DNA damage following HDI
treatment and that apoptosis follows (31). This study suggested
that the chromatin was acetylated first and that DNA damage
occurred just before DNA fragmentation. Finally, the increase in
acetylation might reflect the selective removal by HAMLET of
cells with poorly acetylated chromatin but this was not likely,
as virtually all cells had hyperacetylated H4 before HAMLET
exposure, due to TSA pretreatment. Further studies are needed to
understand the molecular basis of hyperacetylation response to
HAMLET and TSA.
DNA damage triggers cell death if the damage exceeds the
threshold for repair. This might be the case in HAMLET- and TSAtreated cells (Fig. 6), as HAMLET triggered DNA fragmentation,
which was enhanced by TSA. Previous studies have shown that
HDIs induce phosphorylated H2AX expression (31), but in our case,
the increase was small due to the short exposure times. Like p53,
p21WAF1 is activated by DNA damage and triggers cell cycle arrest

by inducing cell differentiation (32). p21WAF1 transcription
and a p53 response (data not shown), were observed, however
suggesting that the cells tried to repair damaged DNA. The consequences of p21WAF1 expression in human cancer is controversial
due to its antiapoptotic and proapoptotic effects ( for review,
see refs. 33, 34). Overexpression of p21WAF1 has been shown to
enhance the apoptotic response to the chemotherapeutic agent
cisplatin in glioma (35) and ovarian carcinoma (36) cell lines.
However, increased p21WAF1 expression may also reduce the
sensitivity to classic cancer treatments (2) and block the caspase
cascade (37). Moreover, antisense expression of p21WAF1 has been
shown to improve cell death in response to HDIs (38) and the
disruption of p21WAF1 induction during HDI treatment was
proposed to lower the apoptotic threshold (26). Previous studies
showed that inhibition was due to cleavage by caspases during cell
death (39), but the present study showed that the decrease was
caspase-independent. The HDI-dependent increase in p21WAF1
was blocked by HAMLET, suggesting that this rescue mechanism is
inactivated. In view of the relative tumor selectivity of HAMLET,
this effect might be relevant for sensitivity and death.
The combined use of HDIs and HAMLET might be of interest in
future cancer therapy. HDIs have shown efficacy in clinical trials,
and some HDIs can be taken orally without important side effects
(40). The compounds act in synergy with other antitumor
treatments, and given their pleiotropic anticancer activities, HDIs
will probably be used in combination with other anticancer drugs.
In clinical studies, HAMLET has been shown to act topically on
skin papillomas and mucosal cancers (11, 13). If combined with
HDIs, the use of HAMLET might also be extended to metastatic
tumors, with topical HAMLET and systemic HDI treatment, to
achieve the optimal combined effect. In this way, the tumor will be
attacked from two different routes. Further studies in animal
models are needed to evaluate the feasibility of this approach.
