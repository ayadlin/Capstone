KRT19 directly interacts with β-catenin/RAC1 complex to
regulate NUMB-dependent NOTCH signaling pathway and
breast cancer properties
SK Saha, HY Choi, BW Kim, AA Dayem, G-M Yang, KS Kim, YF Yin and S-G Cho
Studies have reported that interactions between keratins (KRTs) and other proteins initiate signaling cascades that regulate cell
migration, invasion, and metastasis. In the current study, we found that expression of KRT19 was speciﬁcally high in breast cancers
and signiﬁcantly correlated with their invasiveness. Moreover, knockdown of KRT19 led to increased proliferation, migration,
invasion, drug resistance, and sphere formation in breast cancer cells via an upregulated NOTCH signaling pathway. This was owing
to reduced expression of NUMB, an inhibitory protein of the NOTCH signaling pathway. In addition, we found that KRT19 interacts
with β-catenin/RAC1 complex and enhances the nuclear translocation of β-catenin. Concordantly, knockdown of KRT19 suppressed
the nuclear translocation of β-catenin as well as β-catenin-mediated NUMB expression. Furthermore, modulation of KRT19mediated regulation of NUMB and NOTCH1 expression led to the repression of the cancer stem cell properties of breast cancer
patient-derived CD133high/CXCR4high/ALDH1high cancer stem-like cells (CSLCs), which showed very low KRT19 and high NOTCH1
expression. Taken together, our study suggests a novel function for KRT19 in the regulation of nuclear import of the β-catenin/RAC1
complex, thus modulating the NUMB-dependent NOTCH signaling pathway in breast cancers and CSLCs, which might bear
potential clinical implications for cancer or CSLC treatment.

INTRODUCTION
Breast cancer is a multifactorial disease that can be initiated by
genetic mutations, chronic inﬂammation, exposure to toxic
compounds, and abundant stress factors.1 Despite of being a
subject of concern across the world, the exact mechanism of
breast cancer progression is not completely resolved yet.
Some genes of the keratin (KRT) family are important markers in
reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT–PCR)mediated detection of tumors in the lymph nodes, peripheral
blood, and bone marrows of breast cancer patients.2,3 KRTs are
intermediate ﬁlament proteins responsible for the structural
integrity of epithelial cells and markers of the epithelial tissue.4
Further, they are subdivided into cytokeratins and hair KRTs and
also into low molecular weight acidic type I and high molecular
weight basic or neutral type II.5 KRTs are integrated in the cellular
framework and interact with a range of cellular proteins including
kinases, receptors, adaptors, and effectors. These interactions
activate signaling networks that regulate cell migration, invasion,
metastasis, cell cycle, and apoptosis.4,6 For example, KRT8 and
KRT18 bind with tumor necrosis factor receptor-2 in order to
interact with other speciﬁc downstream proteins. Therefore, they
affect tumor necrosis factor-dependent activation of downstream
effectors such as c-JUN-NH2-kinase and NF-kB.7 In addition, KRT17
binds to the adaptor protein 14-3-3σ to upregulate protein
synthesis and cell growth via the AKT/mTOR pathway.8
One of the smallest intermediate ﬁlament KRT proteins is a
40-kDa type I KRT, KRT19.9 It contains a highly conserved α-helical
central domain, essential for ﬁlament formation, and does not

have a C-terminal non-helical tail domain.10 In a previous study,
KRT19-knocked out mice showed induced skeletal myopathy,11
whereby KRT19 was shown to regulate breast cancer properties by
activating the AKT signaling pathway.12 However, recent studies
have shown that modulation of KRT19 expression led to
contrasting effects on cell proliferation, survival, invasion, migration, and apoptosis, depending on the cancer cell type.12–14
Therefore, extensive molecular studies on KRT19 are required to
elucidate its role in cancer cells.
In this study, we demonstrate that knockdown of KRT19 leads to
increased proliferation, migration, invasion, drug resistance, and
sphere formation in breast cancer cells. We report for the ﬁrst
time, a novel function of KRT19 in the NOTCH signaling pathway.
Our data show that KRT19 directly interacts with β-catenin/RAC1
complex to regulate the stability and translocation of β-catenin. βCatenin, in turn, binds to the NUMB promoter and accelerates its
expression in breast cancer cells. Modulation of NUMB expression
by KRT19 is therefore involved in the NOTCH pathway-mediated
regulation of breast cancer and cancer stem cell properties.
RESULTS
Differential expression of the KRT family of genes in breast cancer
cells

between normal and cancer tissues. Several of these genes
showed altered expression in carcinoma compared with that in

normal tissues (Figure 1a and Supplementary Figure 1).15
Interestingly, invasive breast carcinoma tissues showed relatively
high KRT18 and KRT19 expression. In particular, the fold change for
KRT19 expression in invasive breast carcinoma versus normal
breast tissue was signiﬁcantly higher (P o 0.00001) than that for
the other KRT genes (Figure 1a and Supplementary Figure 1A).
This suggested strong correlation of KRT19 expression with
invasiveness of breast cancers. In order to conﬁrm the speciﬁcity
of our observation, we also examined the fold changes for the KRT
genes in liver and colon cancer (Figure 1a and Supplementary
Figures 1B and C).16,17 The results concluded that indeed, KRT19
expression speciﬁcally correlates with the invasiveness of breast
carcinoma (Figure 1a).

Using RT–PCR, we next evaluated the expression of KRT genes in
several cell lines, including MCF7, SKBR3 and MDA-MB231 (breast
cancer); HepG2 (hepatocellular carcinoma); SH-SY5Y (neuroblastoma); HaCaT (immortalized human keratinocytes); and HEK293T
(immortalized human embryonic kidney cells). In this case, too,
KRT19 was speciﬁcally overexpressed in the breast cancer cell lines
MCF7, SKBR3, and MDA-MB231 (Figure 1b).
Knockdown of KRT19 increases cell proliferation, migration,
invasion, drug resistance, and sphere formation
As the breast cancer cells showed signiﬁcantly high expression of
KRT19 compared with other KRT genes, we next assessed the
effect of KRT19 knockdown in MDA-MB231 and MCF7 cells.

Compared with KRT19 expression in the control (scrambled) short
hairpin (sh)RNA-transduced cells, speciﬁc downregulation of
KRT19 expression (~80%) was achieved in the KRT19-knocked
down shKRT19 MDA-MB231 and shKRT19 MCF7 cells (Figure 1c).
Although the analysis of Oncomine database revealed that the
KRT19 expression positively correlates with the invasiveness of
breast carcinoma (Figure 1a), knockdown of KRT19 expression
resulted in the increased proliferation of the breast cancer cells
(Figure 1d). Migration and invasiveness of MDA-MB231 and MCF7
cells were also signiﬁcantly increased upon KRT19 knockdown
(Figures 1e and f). Subsequent experiments in the presence of
doxorubicin revealed signiﬁcantly elevated drug resistance and its
marker genes expression, including ABCG2, ABCC1, and ABCB5, in
the KRT19-knocked down cells (Figure 1g). KRT19 knockdown also
signiﬁcantly increased colony formation and expression of
stemness markers (OCT4, SOX2, NANOG, and c-MYC) in both the
shKRT19 MDA-MB231 and shKRT19 MCF7 cells (Figures 1h and i).
KRT19 knockdown upregulates NOTCH signaling pathway by
downregulating the expression of NUMB
The unexpected ﬁndings that KRT19 knockdown led to enhancement of breast cancer properties led us to explore the molecular
mechanism behind the phenomenon. Recent report demonstrated that KRT19 had a role in modulation of NOTCH signaling
pathway during the invasion of hepatocellular carcinoma.13 More
recently, a review article summarized on the crucial role of NOTCH
and WNT signaling pathways and the cross-talk between NOTCH
receptor and other oncogenic proteins such as Ras, c-Myc, and
JAG1.18,19 Actually, the WNT/β-catenin signaling pathway was
reported to be positively or negatively cross-linked with the
NOTCH pathway in cancer progression.20–25 Therefore, we try to
investigate whether the NOTCH and WNT signaling pathways are
involved in molecular mechanism underlying the KRT19-silencing
effect in breast cancer cells. First, in the KRT19-knocked down cells,
we checked expression of the canonical WNT/β-catenin signaling
target genes such as AXIN2, TCF7, LEF1, and NUMB. Although the
canonical WNT signaling was generally suggested to be positively
correlated with breast cancer cells,26–28 our results showed that
expression of WNT/β-catenin signaling target genes was signiﬁcantly downregulated (Figure 2a). Furthermore, the TCF/LEFresponsive TOP- or FOP-FLASH transcription assay conﬁrmed the
downregulation of WNT/β-catenin signaling pathway in KRT19silenced cells (Figure 2b). Next, we analyzed the expression of
NOTCH signaling pathway-related genes, such as NOTCH1, MAML1,
RBPjK, HES1, H-RAS, and CCND1. KRT19 knockdown led to increased
expression of NOTCH1 signaling pathway-interacting proteins,
such as MAML1, RBPjK, and NOTCH1 itself (Figure 2c). In this
context, several studies have shown that the NOTCH1 intracellular
domain forms a complex with MAML1 and RBPjK that translocates
to the nucleus to regulate target gene expression.29–32 Concordantly, the expression of NOTCH1 target genes, such as HES1,
CCND1, and H-RAS, were also increased in the KRT19-knocked
down cells in this study (Figure 2c). Signiﬁcantly, we observed that
the expression of NUMB, a key inhibitory protein of the NOTCH
signaling pathway,33 was signiﬁcantly downregulated upon KRT19
knockdown (Figures 2a and c). As WNT/β-catenin pathway was
reported to be interlinked with the NOTCH signaling pathway by
NUMB,34–37 we assumed that KRT19-mediated regulation of NUMB
expression may be crucial for the cross-talk between the WNT and
NOTCH signaling pathways. Furthermore, most Oncomine data
analyses of normal breast tissue versus invasive ductal breast
carcinoma supported the observation that KRT19 expression
correlates positively and inversely with that of NUMB and NOTCH1,
respectively (Figure 2d (ii–iv)),38–40 although a ductal breast
carcinoma in situ versus invasive ductal breast carcinoma in situ
data by Ma et al.15 reported an opposite result (Figure 2d (i)).
Oncogene (2016), 1 – 18

We then examined the effects of inhibiting the NOTCH signaling
pathway by treating shKRT19 cells with N-((3,5-Diﬂuorophenyl)
acetyl)-L-alanyl-2-phenyl)glycine-1,1-dimethylethyl ester (DAPT), a
γ-secretase inhibitor. The results revealed a suppression of
shKRT19-induced expression of NOTCH1 target genes
(Supplementary Figure 2A). Moreover, DAPT treatment could
relieve the shKRT19-mediated increase of cell proliferation
(Figure 3a), migration (Figure 3b), invasion (Figure 3c), and sphere
formation (Figure 3d) in MCF7 cells, but more markedly in the
highly invasive and metastatic MDA-MB231 cells. This demonstrated that the NOTCH signaling pathway is crucial for KRT19
knockdown to exert its cellular effects.
In addition, we tried to suppress the NOTCH signaling pathway
by overexpressing NUMB in shKRT19 cells. We conﬁrmed NUMB
overexpression (Supplementary Figure 2B) and found that NOTCH
intracellular domain and its target protein expression were
downregulated in NUMB-overexpressing shKRT19 cells, compared
with the shKRT19 cells (Supplementary Figure 2B). Notably, NUMB
overexpression reversed the shKRT19-mediated increase of cell
proliferation (Figure 3e), migration (Figure 3f), or sphere formation
(Figure 3g), conﬁrming that KRT19-mediated regulation of NOTCH
signaling pathway and cancer properties is NUMB dependent.
KRT19 regulates nuclear localization of β-catenin
Next, we focused on the KRT19-dependent regulation of NUMB
transcription. A previous study demonstrated that β-catenin
translocates to the nucleus and binds the TCF4 region of the
NUMB promoter, enhancing transcription of the latter.41 Based on
this information, we investigated whether the β-catenin signaling
pathway is involved in the KRT19-dependent regulation of NUMB
transcription. The expression and phosphorylation (Ser 473 of AKT
and Ser9 of GSK3β) of both AKT and GSK3β were not signiﬁcantly
altered in the KRT19-knocked down cells (Figure 4a), whereas the
total amount of β-catenin and RAC1 proteins were slightly
decreased (Figure 4b). However, the nuclear translocation
of β-catenin was retarded upon KRT19 knockdown (Figure 4b).
Previously, several studies depicted an intriguing but controversial
role of Rac1 in regulation of β-catenin nuclear localization.42–45
Our results revealed that KRT19 knockdown markedly suppressed
nuclear translocation of RAC1, a binding partner of β-catenin that
aids nuclear translocation of the latter.43,46 Meanwhile, the
cytoplasm presented higher amounts of β-catenin and RAC1 in
the shKRT19 cells compared with that in control cells.
Nuclear translocation of β-catenin and RAC1 was then
monitored by immunocytochemistry. This conﬁrmed that both
overall and nuclear β-catenin and RAC1 levels were signiﬁcantly
downregulated upon KRT19 knockdown (Figure 4c), whereas that
in the cytoplasm was increased. These results strongly suggested
that regulation of β-catenin and RAC1 nuclear translocation is
involved in the KRT19-dependent regulation of NUMB
transcription.
KRT19 interacts with β-catenin and RAC1 to modulate nuclear
translocation of the former
As RAC1 was reported to be a binding partner of β-catenin and
may help nuclear translocation of β-catenin,43,46 we performed
coimmunoprecipitation experiments and revealed the interaction
of KRT19 with β-catenin and RAC1 in the breast cancer cell lines
(Figure 5a). However, KRT19 knockdown signiﬁcantly inhibited
these interactions (Figure 5b). Upon treatment with the proteasome inhibitor MG132, β-catenin levels were increased and KRT19
levels were slightly augmented, whereas that of RAC1 was not
signiﬁcantly altered (Figure 5c). The interactions among KRT19,
β-catenin and RAC1 were only slightly enhanced upon treatment
with MG132, but markedly decreased upon KRT19 knockdown
even in presence of MG132 (Figure 5d). These results suggest the
role of KRT19 in its interactions with β-catenin and RAC1.

Patient-derived CD133high/CXCR4high/ALDH1high cancer stem-like
cells (CSLCs) have decreased KRT19 expression and highly
enhanced CSLC properties
Interestingly, we observed a marked suppression of KRT19
expression in the CD133high/CXCR4high/ALDH1high cancer stemlike cells (KU-CSLCs), which were prepared from chemo-treated
breast cancer patients at the Konkuk University hospital
(Figure 6a). Compared with the MDA-MB231 cells, KU-CSLCs
showed lower NUMB, but higher NOTCH1 and HES1 (target of
NOTCH1) expression (Figure 6b). Our data also demonstrated that
KU-CSLCs have remarkably high sphere-forming capacity not only
in sphere-forming media, but also in normal growth media
(Figures 6c and d). KU-CSLCs also showed signiﬁcantly enhanced
expression of stemness and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition
markers, such as NANOG, OCT4, SOX2, and N-cadherin, with
reduction in p53 and E-cadherin levels (Figures 6e and f).
Examination of KU-CSLCs using a xenograft mouse model
revealed that these cells possess highly enhanced tumorigenic
capacity in vivo (Figures 6g, h, and i).
As KU-CSLCs showed either very low or no KRT19 expression
together with high NOTCH1 expression, similar to the shKRT19
MDA-MB231 cells, we next investigated whether KRT19 can
regulate cancer stem cell properties by modulating the NOTCH
signaling pathway. First, we treated the cells with DAPT (a NOTCH
signaling inhibitor), which led to signiﬁcant decrease in the
expression of NOTCH1 and HES1. However, DAPT did not affect
NUMB expression in both the shKRT19 MDA-MB231 and KU-CSLCs
(Figure 6j). Importantly, DAPT treatment suppressed proliferation
and migration of KU-CSLCs, similar to that in the shKRT19
MDA-MB231 cells (Figures 6k and l; Supplementary Figure 3A).
The cancer stem cell properties, including expression of
stemness/epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition markers, and
sphere-formation capacity of KU-CSLCs were also suppressed by
DAPT treatment (Supplementary Figures 3B and C). KU-CSLCs
showed KRT19 and NOTCH1 expression lower and higher,
respectively, than the shKRT19 MDA-MB231 cells did (Figure 6j).
The DAPT-mediated effect was also more marked in KU-CSLCs
than in the shKRT19 MDA-MB231 cells (Figures 6–l). These results
supported KRT19-dependent regulation of the NOTCH signaling
pathway.
Either overexpression of KRT19 or knockdown of NOTCH1 led to
decreased proliferation, migration, drug resistance, and sphere
formation in the patient-derived KU-CSLCs
Finally, to conﬁrm the function of KRT19 in regulating the NOTCH
signaling pathway, we either overexpressed KRT19 or knocked
down NOTCH1 in the KU-CSLCs, both of which were successfully
achieved (Figure 7a). Overexpression of KRT19 increased NUMB
and decreased NOTCH1 and HES1 expression. Meanwhile, NOTCH1
knockdown led to decreased HES1 expression, without affecting
either NUMB or KRT19 levels (Figure 7a). Importantly, both KRT19
overexpression and NOTCH1 knockdown signiﬁcantly suppressed
cell proliferation (Figure 7b) and migration (Figure 7c and
Supplementary Figure 4). Drug resistance, expression of drugresistance markers (Figure 7d), sphere formation (Figure 7e), and
expression of stemness markers (Figure 7f) were also suppressed
upon KRT19 overexpression and NOTCH1 knockdown in KU-CSLCs.
These results strongly supported that KRT19 modulates the
NUMB-dependent NOTCH signaling pathway in breast cancers
and patient-derived CD133high/CXCR4high/ALDH1high/KRT19low
CSLCs, thus harboring potential clinical implications.
DISCUSSION
A prominent type I ﬁlament protein, KRT19 is abundantly
expressed in epithelial tumor cells and is a marker for metastatic
tumors.47–49 Its overexpression in circulating tumor cells (CTCs)

5
governs its crucial role in regulating their cancerous properties.
However, a previous gene proﬁling microarray study showed that
KRT19 is differentially expressed in different breast cancer cell
lines. Moreover, its expression in these cell lines showed reciprocal
correlation with their cancer properties (that is, high KRT19 with
low CD44 and vice versa).50 In fact, several reports have
demonstrated the contradictory effects of KRT19 on cancer
properties, depending on its concentration and the cell type
involved.12–14 For instance, cancer properties were positively
regulated through the KRT19/HER2 signaling pathway by very
high KRT19 levels in HER2-overexpressed breast cancer.51 Meanwhile, negative regulation was observed in the BT474 and SKBR3
breast cancer cells, through the KRT19/Egr-1 signaling pathway, at
either very low or no KRT19 concentration.12 Another study
demonstrated that overexpression of KRT19 in the BT549 breast
cancer cell line (expresses low levels of endogenous KRT19)
inhibits cell proliferation and induces cell arrest by regulating
endoplasmic reticulum stress and its related signaling pathway.
Meanwhile, KRT19 knockdown yielded the opposite results in
MDA-MB231 cells (which express high endogenous KRT19).52
Furthermore, KRT19 also has a critical role in the proliferation and
invasiveness of some subtypes of hepatocellular carcinomas,13,53
functioning as a cancer stem cell marker in the same.14 Overall,
therefore, the role of KRT19 in cancer (that is, progression or
suppression) remains to be resolved through extensive molecular
studies.
In this study, we compared the expression patterns of KRT
genes (KRT1–20) in normal and cancer tissues, and found speciﬁc
high expression of KRT19 in invasive breast cancer. Although the
analysis of Oncomine database suggested strong correlation of
KRT19 expression with breast cancer invasiveness, knockdown of
KRT19 expression yielded increased cell proliferation, migration,
invasion, drug resistance and sphere formation in breast cancer
cells, which showed speciﬁcally enhanced KRT19 expression. Our
results demonstrate that high KRT19 levels may negatively
affect proliferation and invasiveness of breast cancers, though
several KRT genes (including KRT19) are reported as important
markers for RT–PCR-mediated detection of cancers.2,3 Importantly,
KRT19 expression was markedly suppressed in CD133high/
CXCR4high /ALDH1high KU-CSLCs, which were prepared from
chemo-treated breast cancer patients and showed abnormally
elevated cell proliferation, migration, invasion, drug resistance,
and sphere formation. In addition, KRT19 overexpression in
KU-CSLCs signiﬁcantly suppressed their proliferation and migration (Figure 7), strongly supporting the anticancer/-CSLC function
of KRT19.
The underlying molecular mechanism of KRT19 must be studied
in order to understand better its functions in cancer cells. We
report here, for the ﬁrst time, a novel function of KRT19 in
regulation of the NUMB-dependent NOTCH signaling pathway in
breast cancer cells and CSLCs. NOTCH possesses oncogenic
functions in several cancers, including leukemia and breast
cancer,54,55 and also regulates differentiation, proliferation, and
growth of either cancer or stem cells.56,57 Several studies
also reported that NUMB-mediated regulation of the NOTCH
signaling pathway modulates migration and invasion in different
tumor cell types, including pancreatic,58 ovarian,59 and prostate.60
NUMB also suppresses the NOTCH signaling pathway through
proteolytic degradation of the NOTCH intracellular domain.33
Furthermore, it regulates asymmetric cell division in mammalian
development, cell adhesion and migration, as well as a number of
signaling pathways.35,61,62 Recent studies conﬁrmed that the
NOTCH signaling pathway is suppressed by overexpressed
NUMB, suggesting that the latter acts as a tumor suppressor.63,64
In the current study, KRT19 knockdown-mediated suppression of
NUMB expression led to increased NOTCH activity as well as
NOTCH-dependent proliferation of breast cancer cells. Importantly, we demonstrated the crucial function of KRT19 in

signaling pathway. NUMB, a direct transcriptional target of the
WNT signaling pathway, could ubiquitously degrade NOTCH
intracellular domain and negatively regulate NOTCH signaling
pathway.35,36 Furthermore, previous studies demonstrated that
inhibition of NUMB resulted in activation of NOTCH signaling

pathway.65,66 KRT19-mediated regulation of NUMB expression
may be crucial for cross-linking and balancing of the canonical

in detail in the further study. Essentially, our results demonstrated
that silencing of KRT19 expression inhibits formation of the βOncogene (2016), 1 – 18

Rac1–β-catenin complexes toward the nucleus.67–69 In addition, a
protein complex composed of RAC1B, β-catenin and disheveled
functions to enhance nuclear translocation of transcription factors
required for increased interaction with the target promoters.46
These studies corroborate our proposed mechanism that KRT19
directly interacts with the β-catenin-RAC1 complex to promote
nuclear translocation of β-catenin and activate NUMB
transcription.
Our data also showed that the effect of KRT19 knockdown is
more marked in the highly invasive and metastatic MDA-MB231
breast cancer cells (‘basal’ type, triple negative (ER−PR−HER2−)),
compared with that in the MCF7 cells (‘luminal’ type, ER+PR+).70 A
previous report demonstrated that KRT19+ CTCs differentially
affect breast cancer patients with ER-negative and -positive (basaland luminal-like CTCs, respectively) tumors. Despite of similar
KRT19 expression in CTCs of both tumor types, the clinical
outcomes of prognosis differed depending on the ER expression,

especially at the early stages.2 Speciﬁcally, breast cancer patients
with ER− CTCs showed poor prognosis than those with ER+
CTCs.2,71–76 Concomitantly, in this study, KRT19-dependent
regulation of the NOTCH signaling pathway signiﬁcantly modulated the cancer/CSLC properties of KU-CSLCs, which are ER−. ERα
is known to increase the expression of KRT19, (ref. 77–80) and
NOTCH signaling activity is higher in ERα− cells than in ERα+
ones.81,82 Furthermore, one previous study has reported an
important and differential role of NOTCH signaling pathway in
regulation of cancer/CSLC properties either in ERα+ or ERα− and
triple negative breast cancer.83 Further studies are required to
elucidate the effects of ER, PR, and HER2 expression on KRT19mediated regulation of the NOTCH signaling pathway as well as
cancer/CSLC properties.
In conclusion, our study shows that KRT19 directly interacts with
the β-catenin-RAC1 complex, and stabilizes ubiquitination and
proteasomal degradation of β-catenin to increase its nuclear
translocation. NUMB expression is enhanced in the process, which

then downregulates NOTCH signaling; its target genes; and
consequently, cell proliferation, migration, invasion, drug resistance, and sphere formation (Figure 8). Our data might be crucial
to understand the molecular basis of KRT19- and NOTCHmediated regulation of cancer/CSLC properties, and might hold
potential clinical implications as well.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture
Human cell lines for breast cancer (MDA-MB231, SKBR3, and MCF7),
hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2), neuroblastoma (SH-SY5Y), immortalized
human keratinocytes (HaCaT), and embryonic kidney cells (HEK293T) are
obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA,
USA). All cell lines and breast cancer patient-derived CD133high/CXCR4high/
ALDH1high high sphere-forming KU-CSLCs were cultured in either high
glucose-Dulbecco's Modiﬁed Eagle Medium or Roswell Park Memorial
Institute medium (DMEM or RPMI) 1640 (Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO,
USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were maintained in
a humidiﬁed incubator at 5% CO2 and 37 °C. All cell lines were
authenticated by short tandem repeat proﬁling and were tested for
mycoplasma contamination using BioMycoX Mycoplasma PCR Detection
Kit (Cat. No. CS-D-25) (Cellsafe, Yeongtong-gu, Suwon, Republic of Korea).

CD133high/CXCR4high/ALDH1high KU-CSLCs were prepared from breast
tumor tissue specimens, which were collected from chemo-treated
patients who underwent mammotomy for breast tumors at the Breast
Cancer Center, Konkuk University Hospital, Seoul. The study was performed
with approval from the Institutional Review Board (IRB, KUH 1020003).

Knockdown and overexpression of KRT19 and NOTCH1
Sense and antisense oligonucleotides for control (scrambled), KRT19(shKRT19),12 and NOTCH1-speciﬁc (shNOTCH1) shRNA,84 containing BamHI
and EcoRI restriction sites, were annealed by using annealing buffer (TrisEDTA buffer (pH 8), 100 mM NaCl (Sigma-Aldrich)). Next, the annealed
oligonucleotides were inserted into the pGreenPuro lentiviral expression
vector (System Biosciences, Mountain View, CA, USA) to construct KRT19-,
NOTCH1-knocked down, or control vectors. The oligonucleotide sequences
of the shRNAs are listed in Table 1.
For overexpression of KRT19, its complete coding sequence was cloned
into the pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) using the
primers listed in Table 1. The complete coding sequence was further
subcloned into the pCDH-EF1-MCS-T2A-copGFP lentiviral vector (System
Biosciences) using XbaI and EcoRI restriction enzymes and the primers
listed in Table 1.
HEK293T cells were transfected with the speciﬁc lentiviral vector and
viral packaging plasmids, RRE and REV, using calcium phosphate
transfection protocol. After 72 h of incubation at 5% CO2 and 37 °C,

Figure 8. Schematic diagram depicting the KRT19-mediated regulation of NUMB expression, NOTCH signaling pathway and cancer/cancer
stem-like cells (CSLC) properties in KRT19-overexpressing breast cancer cells. (a) KRT19 directly interacts with the β-catenin-RAC1 complex and
stabilizes the ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of β-catenin. This increases the nuclear translocation of β-catenin, enhancing NUMB
expression in the process, which downregulates NOTCH signaling, its target genes, and consequently, cell proliferation, migration, invasion,
drug resistance, and sphere formation. Patient-derived CD133high/CXCR4high/ALDH1high KU-CSLCs, which showed signiﬁcantly reduced KRT19
expression, (b) displayed highly enhanced CSLC properties.

viruses were collected and concentrated using an ultracentrifuge (Optima
L-90K, Beckman Coulter Inc., CA, USA). MDA-MB231 and MCF7 cells were
then infected with either scrambled shRNA or shKRT19 lentiviruses,
whereas KU-CSLCs were infected with either scrambled shRNA, shNOTCH1
or KRT19-expressing lentiviruses and incubated overnight at 5% CO2 and
37 °C. For virus infection, ~ 8.0 × 108 IU/ml viral particles were used to get
stably expressing cells. To measure virus titer, we use the following
equation, titer in IU/ml = (((no. of cells at starting time) × (dilution factor) ×
(percent infection))/(volume virus solution added expressed in ml)) as
described previously.85 Next, the media were substituted with normal
growth media (high glucose DMEM/RPMI 1640 with 10% fetal bovine
serum). The virus infection efﬁciency was calculated to be o 95%, and
knockdown or overexpression was assessed by RT–PCR and western blot
analyses.
For NUMB overexpression, MDA-MB231 and MCF7 KRT19-knocked down
cells were incubated overnight at a density of 2 × 105 cells per wells in 24well culture plate and transfected with the expression vectors (pEF-BOSmyc-NUMB and control vector, kind gifts from professor Hee-Sae Park
(Chonnam National University) using Lipofectamine in 1:3 ratio (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA, USA). After 48 h of post-transfection, half of cells were
harvested for western blotting and the remained cells were used for cell
proliferation, migration and sphere-formation analyses.

Total RNA extraction and RT–PCR analyses
Total RNA was extracted from the cells using Easy-Blue total RNA extraction
kit (iNtRON Biotechnology, Republic of Korea) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The concentration of total RNA was measured using
Nanodrop (ND1000) spectrophotometer (Nanodrop Technologies Inc.,
Wilmington DE, USA). Subsequently, 2 μg of total RNA was used for cDNA
synthesis with M-MLV reverse transcriptase (Promega) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Sequences of the primers used are given in
Table 2. After the PCR reaction, the products were analyzed on either 1 or
1.5% agarose gels. Quantitative real-time RT–PCR was done using a
PTC-200 thermal cycler with Chromo4 optical detector (MJ Research/
Bio-Rad, CA, USA) using Fast SYBR Green Master Mix (Applied Biosystems,

Table 2.

Stockholm, Sweden). mRNA expression was normalized to that of the
control housekeeping gene, GAPDH as described previously.86

Western blot analysis
Cells were lysed using lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich), 100 mM
Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol (Amresco, Solon OH, USA),
50 mM sodium ﬂuoride (Sigma-Aldrich), 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl
ﬂuoride (PMSF; Sigma-Aldrich), 1 mM p-nitrophenyl phosphate (SigmaAldrich), and 1 mM sodiumorthovanadate (Sigma-Aldrich)) and the lysates
were centrifuged at 13 000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. The protein supernatant
was quantiﬁed using Bradford protein assay reagent (BioRad), and the
proteins were resolved by either 10 or 12% sodium dodecyl sulfate
polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The separated proteins were then
transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad). After blocking with
5% skimmed milk in Tris-buffered saline for 1 h, the membranes were
incubated with appropriate primary antibodies against KRT19 (SC-53258,
1:500), cyclinD1 (SC-717, 1:1000), H-RAS (SC-35, 1:1000), NUMB (SC-15590,
1:200), β-catenin (SC-7199, 1:2000), RAC1 (SC-217, 1:500), AKT (SC-1619,
1:1000), phospho (p)-AKT (SC-16646-R, 1:1000), GSK3β (SC-9166, 1:1000),
p-GSK3β (SC-11757, 1:1000), HES1 (SC-13844, 1:500), actin (SC-1616,
1:1000) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA), and intracellular
domain (ab83232, 1:1000) (Abcam, Cambridge, UK) overnight at 4 °C. This
was followed by a 2 h incubation with anti-mouse (SC-2005), -goat
(SC-2020), -rabbit (SC-2004) or –rat (SC-2006) IgGs (1:1000) tagged with
horse radish peroxidase (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Protein signals were
detected using an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Amersham
Bioscience, Piscataway, NJ, USA) as described previously.86

Cell proliferation, invasion, wound-healing/migration and
drug-resistance assays
Cell proliferation was performed as described.87 For analysis of cell
proliferation, 2 × 104 cells/well were seeded in 12-well dishes. For 4 days,
the cells (in triplicates) were trypsinized and enumerated every 24 h using
a hemocytometer.

Invasion assay was conducted using CytoSelect 96-Wells Cell Invasion
Assay Kit (Cell Biolabs Inc., CA, USA) as described.88 Cells (1 × 105) were
seeded in 96-well culture plates, and the assay was conducted according
to the manufacturer’s protocol.
Wound-healing/migration assay was performed as described.89 In brief,
1 × 106 cells were seeded in 60-mm plates and grown until 90% conﬂuent.
Prior to the experiment, the cells were incubated with mitomycin C
(10 μg/ml), which inhibits cell division. After 2–3 h of incubation at 5% CO2
and 37 °C, the cell monolayer was wounded with a 200 μl pipette tip. Cells
were then washed thrice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and images
of this wound were acquired by Nikon eclipse TE2000-U microscopy (Nikon
Instruments Inc., Melville, NY, USA) at various time points (0, 12 and 24 h).
Drug-resistance analysis was performed as described previously.90 In
brief, 1 × 105 cells were seeded in 12-well dishes. Following overnight
incubation at 5% CO2 and 37 °C, they were treated with 0.5 μM doxorubicin
and incubated for another 48 h. They were then enumerated and
represented as percent (%) of surviving cells.

Sphere-formation assay
Cells (1 × 104) were cultured and suspended in either growth medium
(DMEM/RPMI 1640 (Sigma-Aldrich) with 10% fetal bovine serum) or SM
(sphere-formation medium: serum-free DMEM/F12 supplemented with
B27-supplement (1:50; Invitrogen)) supplemented with 20 ng/ml epidermal
growth factor (Sigma-Aldrich), 10 μg/ml insulin (Invitrogen), and 0.4%
bovine serum albumin (Sigma-Aldrich), using non-coated plates. To
propagate the spheres in vitro, they were collected by gentle centrifugation, dissociated into single cells as described previously,91,92 and then
cultured to obtain next-generation spheres. Spheres from MDA-MB-231,
MCF7 cells, and KU-CSLCs were collected after 5 days of culture, stained
with crystal violet (Sigma-Aldrich) and photographed by Nikon eclipse
TE2000-U microscopy (Nikon Instruments Inc.) prior to colony counting.

Luciferase reporter assay
For luciferase reporter assays, 1 × 105 MDA-MB-231 or MCF7 cells were
seeded in 12-well plate and transiently transfected with either 200 ng of
TOP- or FOP-FLASH (kind gifts from professor Keun Il Kim (Sookmyung
Women’s University) by using Lipofectamine 2000 reagents (1:3 ratio)
(Invitrogen).93 After 48 h post transfection, the luciferase activity using a
luciferase assay system (Promega) was analyzed by a luminometer (Veritas
microplate luminometer, Turner Biosystems, CA, USA) and transfection
efﬁciency was normalized by β-galactosidase expression.

Coimmunoprecipitation analysis
To investigate the protein–protein interactions, cell lysates (400 μg) were
precleaned with 50 μl Protein A/G sepharose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology)
for 2 h with agitation at 4 °C, and then centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 1 min.
The supernatant was collected and incubated with either primary
antibodies or normal rabbit/mouse IgG overnight at 4 °C. Next, another
50 μl of protein A/G sepharose was added and incubated for another 4 h at
4 °C. The pellet was then washed thrice with cell lysis buffer, and the
immunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate
polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and subsequent western blotting as
described previously.12

In vivo tumorigenicity analysis
Either MDA-MB231 cells or KU-CSLCs (100, 1000 or 10 000) were injected
subcutaneously into the lower ﬂanks of 5-month-old female severe
combined immunodeﬁcient mice,94 purchased from KRIBB (Korean
Research Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology, Republic of Korea).
The mice were monitored for tumor formation and growth. The mice were
killed 4 weeks post tumor formation, and the tumor weights and volume
determined as described previously.95 For statistical analysis, at least ﬁve
mice were used in each group. During the study, the mice were excluded if
they died or did not form tumor. According to body weight of mice, they
were evenly divided into two groups but not randomly. During the
experiment, investigator was blinded for allocation of group. The mice
were cared for and treated in compliance with the institutional guidelines
(KU11039).

Statistical analyses
All experiments were conducted independently at least thrice. Data were
analyzed using GraphPad InStat version 3 program (Graphpad, Sandiego,
CA, USA) and presented as average values ± s.d. Statistical analyses were
done using two-tailed Student’s t-test for two groups and, for multiple
comparison test, analysis of variance was performed with adjusting
Tukey–Kramer to compare treated versus control. A P-valueo0.05 was
considered statistically signiﬁcant.

Immunocytochemistry
Immunocytochemistry was performed as described previously.86 In brief,
Cells (1 × 104) were seeded and incubated for 24 h at 5% CO2 and 37 °C.
They were then washed with PBS, ﬁxed with 4% paraformaldehyde, and
permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 10 min. The ﬁxed cells were
blocked with 10% normal goat serum (Vector Lab, Burlingame CA, USA) in
PBS for 1 h, followed by incubation with primary antibody, diluted in PBS,
overnight at 4 °C. After washing thrice with PBS, the cells were incubated
with secondary antibody for 1 h and washed with PBS again. Nuclei were
stained with TOPRO3 (10 μg/ml; Invitrogen) for an additional 10–15 min.
Next, the cells were washed thrice with PBS. Immunoﬂuorescence was
monitored with a Leica TCS SP5 II laser scanning confocal microscope
(Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany).

Cell fractionation
Cell fraction was performed as described previously.12 In brief, cells were
washed with ice-cold PBS and harvested in cytoplasmic extraction buffer
(10 mM HEPES (pH 7.9; Sigma-Aldrich) 10 mM KCl (Sigma-Aldrich), 0.1 mM
EDTA (Sigma-Aldrich), 0.1 mM EGTA (Sigma-Aldrich), 1 mM dithiothreitol
(DTT; Invitrogen), and 0.5 mM PMSF (Sigma-Aldrich)). The cell suspension
was agitated for 10 min at 4 °C, followed by further agitation for another
10 min at 4 °C with NP-40 (ﬁnal 0.5% (Sigma-Aldrich)). They were then
centrifuged at 13 000 rpm at 4 °C for 5 min. The supernatant was collected
as the cytoplasmic fraction. Next, the nuclear pellets were washed 2–3
times with cold PBS and resuspended in nuclear extraction buffer (20 mM
HEPES (pH 7.9), 400 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM DTT, and 1 mM
PMSF). The suspended sample was agitated for 10 min at 4 °C, followed by
centrifugation at 13 000 rpm at 4 °C for 10 min. The supernatants were
then collected as the nuclear fraction.
