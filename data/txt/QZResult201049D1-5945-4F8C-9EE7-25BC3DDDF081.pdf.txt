Abstract

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Therapeutic strategies based on modulation of microRNA (miRNA) activity hold great promise due
to the ability of these small RNAs to potently influence cellular behavior. In this study, we
investigated the efficacy of a miRNA-based therapy for liver cancer. We demonstrate that
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells exhibit reduced expression of miR-26a, a miRNA that is
normally expressed at high levels in diverse tissues. Expression of this miRNA in liver cancer cells
in vitro induces cell-cycle arrest associated with direct targeting of cyclins D2 and E2. Systemic
administration of this miRNA in a mouse model of HCC using adeno-associated virus (AAV) results
in inhibition of cancer cell proliferation, induction of tumor-specific apoptosis, and dramatic
protection from disease progression without toxicity. These findings suggest that delivery of miRNAs
that are highly expressed and therefore tolerated in normal tissues but lost in disease cells may provide
a general strategy for highly-specific miRNA-based therapies.

Introduction
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a diverse class of highly conserved small RNA molecules that
function as critical regulators of gene expression in multicellular eukaryotes and some
unicellular eukaryotes (Kato and Slack, 2008). miRNAs are initially transcribed as long
primary transcripts (pri-miRNAs) that undergo sequential processing by the RNase III
endonucleases Drosha and Dicer to yield the mature ~20–23 nucleotide species (Kim, 2005).
Mature miRNAs associate with the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) and interact with
sites of imperfect complementarity in 3' untranslated regions (UTRs) of target mRNAs.
Targeted transcripts subsequently undergo accelerated turnover and translational repression
(Valencia-Sanchez et al., 2006). Importantly, the ability of individual miRNAs to regulate
hundreds of transcripts allows these RNAs to coordinate complex programs of gene expression
and thereby induce global changes in cellular physiology. Indeed, a growing body of evidence
has documented that miRNAs provide functions essential for normal development and cellular
homeostasis and accordingly, dysfunction of these molecules has been linked to several human
diseases (Kloosterman and Plasterk, 2006).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Over the last five years, a particularly important role for miRNAs in cancer pathogenesis has
emerged. Virtually all examined tumor types are characterized by globally abnormal miRNA
expression patterns (Calin and Croce, 2006). Profiles of miRNA expression are highly
informative for tumor classification, prognosis, and response to therapy. Moreover, recent
results have documented a functional contribution of specific miRNAs to cellular
transformation and tumorigenesis. For example, miRNAs are known targets of genomic lesions
that frequently activate oncogenes and inactivate tumor suppressors in cancer cells such as
amplification, deletion, and epigenetic silencing (Calin et al., 2004; Lujambio and Esteller,
2007; Zhang et al., 2006). Additionally, miRNAs provide critical functions downstream of
classic oncogenic and tumor suppressor signaling pathways such as those controlled by Myc
and p53 (Chang et al., 2008; He et al., 2007b; O'Donnell et al., 2005). Finally, functional studies
have directly documented the potent pro- and anti-tumorigenic activity of specific miRNAs
both in vitro and in vivo (Ventura and Jacks, 2009).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

As a consequence of the important functions provided by miRNAs in cancer cells, potential
therapeutic approaches that target this pathway have recently attracted attention. Although
significant focus in this area has been directed towards antisense-mediated inhibition of
oncogenic miRNAs (Love et al., 2008; Stenvang et al., 2008), several lines of evidence suggest
that miRNA replacement represents an equally viable if not more efficacious strategy.
Although specific miRNAs are often overexpressed in cancer cells, most miRNAs are
downregulated in tumors (Gaur et al., 2007; Lu et al., 2005). Global miRNA repression
enhances cellular transformation and tumorigenesis in both in vitro and in vivo models (Kumar
et al., 2007), underscoring the pro-tumorigenic effects of miRNA loss-of-function. Moreover,
we have previously demonstrated that hyperactivity of Myc, a common occurrence in diverse
tumor types, leads to widespread miRNA repression (Chang et al., 2008). Enforced expression
of individual miRNAs in lymphoma cells transformed by Myc or other oncogenes dramatically
suppresses tumorigenesis. These observations suggest that re-expression of even a single
miRNA in tumor cells could provide significant therapeutic benefit. Supporting this notion,
two recent reports demonstrated that viral delivery of let-7 miRNAs suppressed tumor growth
in a mouse model of lung adenocarcinoma (Esquela-Kerscher et al., 2008; Kumar et al.,
2008). Importantly, let-7 directly targets KRAS, the initiating oncogene in this tumor model
(Johnson et al., 2005). Thus, the utility of miRNAs as more general anti-cancer therapeutics
in situations where they do not target the initiating oncogene remains to be studied.
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third-leading cause of death from cancer and the fifth
most common malignancy worldwide (Roberts, 2008; Thorgeirsson and Grisham, 2002). HCC

is often diagnosed at an advanced stage when it is no longer amenable to curative therapies.
Highly active drug-metabolizing pathways and multi-drug resistance transporter proteins in
tumor cells further diminish the efficacy of current therapeutic regimens for this cancer type.
Alternative approaches are therefore needed to overcome these barriers to successful therapy.
Fortunately, the liver is well-suited for such alternative strategies since it is easily targeted by
both viral and non-viral gene and small-molecule delivery systems (Alexander et al., 2008;
Pathak et al., 2008). In this regard, gene therapy vectors based on adeno-associated virus (AAV)
are particularly promising. Recent advances in AAV vector technology include a selfcomplementary genome which enhances therapeutic gene expression and non-human primate
AAV serotypes which facilitate efficient transduction following vascular delivery.
Significantly, these improvements allow 90–100% transduction of hepatocytes and long-term
gene expression without toxicity following a single systemic administration of recombinant
virus (McCarty et al., 2003; Nakai et al., 2005; Rodino-Klapac et al., 2007; Wang et al.,
2003). Due to their small size, regulatory RNAs are especially amenable to AAV-mediated
delivery.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

In this study, we tested the hypothesis that miRNAs can be used as general anti-cancer
therapeutics through their effects on tumor cell proliferation and death even when they do not
target the initiating oncogene. We reasoned that the most therapeutically useful miRNAs would
be expressed at low levels in tumors but would be highly expressed, and therefore tolerated,
in normal tissues. miR-26a fulfills these criteria, exhibiting high expression in normal adult
liver but low expression in both human and murine liver tumors. miR-26a directly
downregulates cyclins D2 and E2 and induces a G1 arrest of human liver cancer cells in
vitro. AAV-mediated miR-26a delivery potently suppresses cancer cell proliferation and
activates tumor-specific apoptosis in vivo, resulting in dramatic suppression of tumor
progression without toxicity. These findings provide proof-of-concept support for systemic
delivery of tumor-suppressing miRNAs as a powerful and highly specific anti-cancer
therapeutic modality.

Results
Downregulation of putative anti-tumorigenic miRNAs in Myc-induced liver tumors

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We previously demonstrated that Myc activation in B cell lymphoma models results in
downregulation of a large cohort of miRNAs including miR-15a/16, miR-26a, miR-34a,
miR-150, and miR-195 (Chang et al., 2008). Enforced expression of these specific miRNAs
dramatically inhibits B cell lymphomagenesis. In order to extend these findings to a solid tumor
model and to investigate the potential use of these miRNAs as anti-cancer therapeutics, we
studied their expression in a previously described model of liver cancer in which mice harboring
a tetracycline (tet)-repressible MYC transgene (tet-o-MYC) are crossed with mice expressing
the tet-transactivator protein (tTA) driven by the liver activator promoter (LAP) (Beer et al.,
2004; Felsher and Bishop, 1999; Shachaf et al., 2004). Upon removal of doxycycline (dox),
bi-transgenic animals express MYC specifically in the liver and subsequently develop liver
tumors resembling HCC with complete penetrance.
We sought miRNAs that are highly expressed and therefore tolerated in normal tissues but are
expressed at reduced levels in tumors. Such miRNAs might exhibit anti-proliferative and proapoptotic effects that are restricted to cancer cells. Northern blotting revealed that miR-26a,
and to a lesser extent miR-15a and miR-16, fulfilled these criteria, exhibiting high expression
in normal liver from adult mice lacking the LAP-tTA transgene (harboring an inactive tet-oMYC transgene) but low expression in liver tumors from tet-o-MYC; LAP-tTA bi-transgenic
animals (Figure 1A). Notably, these miRNAs did not exhibit reduced expression in normalappearing liver from bi-transgenic animals, consistent with the previous demonstration that
Myc levels are only minimally increased in non-tumor tissue in these mice (Shachaf et al.,
Cell. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2010 June 12.

2004). Additional miRNAs with anti-tumorigenic activity in B lymphoma cells were expressed
at approximately equivalent levels in normal liver and tumors (miR-195, Figure 1A) or were
not detectable in these tissues (miR-150, data not shown). miR-34a was strongly upregulated
in liver tumors (Figure 1A), perhaps reflecting its regulation by p53 which is retained and active
in some tumors in these animals (Beer et al., 2004; He et al., 2007b). As expected, miR-17 was
expressed at high levels in liver tumors, consistent with our previous demonstration that the
miR-17-92 cluster is directly transactivated by Myc (O'Donnell et al., 2005).
Because miR-26a exhibited the most dramatic downregulation in liver tumors in bi-transgenic
animals, we further examined its expression in a panel of human HCC samples. Consistent
with the mouse tumor data, miR-26a was expressed at statistically-significantly lower levels
in human tumors compared to normal human liver tissue (Figure 1B). Paired normal liver
biopsy material was available for a subset of the HCC samples. 7/8 of these samples showed
reduced miR-26a expression relative to the associated normal liver control (Figure 1C). Based
on these results from human and mouse liver tumors, we selected miR-26a for functional
studies to evaluate its anti-tumorigenic properties and potential therapeutic utility for liver
cancer in vitro and in vivo.
miR-26a expression induces a G1 arrest in human liver cancer cells

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

As an initial test of the anti-proliferative properties of miR-26a in liver cancer cells, we utilized
a murine stem cell virus (MSCV)-derived retroviral construct to enforce expression of this
miRNA in HepG2 cells. As controls for this experiment, we used viruses that express miR-18a,
a component of the pro-tumorigenic miR-17-92 cluster, and miR-34a, which is known to have
potent anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic activity in other cell lines (Bommer et al., 2007;
Chang et al., 2007; He et al., 2007a; Raver-Shapira et al., 2007; Tarasov et al., 2007). Northern
blotting demonstrated that miR-26a expression levels in HepG2 cells closely mirror expression
levels in tumors from tet-o-MYC; LAP-tTA animals (Figure 2A). Infection with MSCVmiR-26a results in enforced expression of this miRNA at a level comparable to that observed
in normal liver tissue. Flow cytometric analysis of retrovirally-infected cell populations
revealed fewer cells in S phase and increased numbers of cells in G1 following infection with
MSCV-miR-26a or MSCV-miR-34a compared to cells infected with MSCV-empty or MSCVmiR-18a, suggesting that miR-26a and miR-34a induce a G1 arrest (Figure 2B). To more
accurately quantify the numbers of cells arrested in G1, we treated cells with the microtubuledestabilizing agent nocodazole which traps cycling cells in M phase. Cell populations with
enforced miR-26a or miR-34a expression were characterized by significantly increased
numbers of cells remaining in G1 (Figure 2C), confirming that these miRNAs arrest the cellcycle at this stage.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

miR-26a directly represses expression of cyclin D2 and cyclin E2
To investigate the mechanisms through which miR-26a induces a G1 cell-cycle arrest, we
examined predicted targets of this miRNA using the Targetscan algorithm (Grimson et al.,
2007). This analysis predicts that miR-26a regulates cyclin E1 (CCNE1), cyclin E2
(CCNE2), cyclin D2 (CCND2), and cyclin-dependent kinase 6 (CDK6), all of which play a
critical role in transition through the G1-S checkpoint (Vermeulen et al., 2003). Western
blotting was used to determine if miR-26a represses any of these putative targets in retrovirallyinfected cell populations. Although infection with MSCV-miR-26a did not affect the
abundance of cyclin E1 and CDK6 (data not shown), significantly reduced levels of cyclin D2
and cyclin E2 were observed in cells with enforced miR-26a expression (Figure 3A,B).
Both CCND2 and CCNE2 have a single predicted miR-26a binding site in their 3' UTRs which
are highly conserved in mammals and, in the case of CCND2, present in chicken (Figure 3C,D).
To verify that these transcripts are directly regulated by miR-26a, reporter plasmids were

constructed in which portions of the 3' UTRs encompassing the predicted binding sites, with
or without mutations that would disrupt miRNA interaction, were cloned downstream of a
luciferase open reading frame. When introduced into HepG2 cells, constructs with intact
miR-26a binding sites were expressed at significantly lower levels than the mutant constructs,
consistent with direct functional interaction of endogenously-expressed miR-26a with these
sites (Figure 3E,F). Co-transfection of reporter plasmids with a synthetic miR-26a mimic
further repressed luciferase activity produced from wild-type, but not mutant, reporter
constructs. Demonstrating the specificity of these effects, co-transfection with a miR-18a
mimic actually diminished downregulation of the wild-type reporters, possibly by competing
for limiting miRNA pathway components and thereby relieving the transcript from repression.
These data document that miR-26a directly represses expression of cyclin D2 and cyclin E2,
providing one mechanism through which this miRNA arrests cell-cycle progression.
MYC is not a target of miR-26a

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Having demonstrated that miR-26a potently arrests proliferation of hepatocellular carcinoma
cells in vitro, we next initiated a series of experiments to assess whether systemic delivery of
this miRNA could be used as a therapeutic strategy for this tumor type in vivo. The tet-oMYC; LAP-tTA liver cancer model represents an ideal setting for these studies. Because these
mice were constructed with a human MYC transgene that includes its 3' UTR (Felsher and
Bishop, 1999), we first confirmed that miR-26a does not regulate MYC itself. MYC is not a
predicted target of miR-26a according to several commonly used algorithms including
Targetscan, miRanda, and PicTar (Betel et al., 2008; Grimson et al., 2007; Krek et al., 2005).
Manual inspection of the human MYC 3' UTR further documents the absence of even a minimal
hexamer complementary to the miR-26a seed sequence. Western blotting confirms that
retroviral expression of miR-26a in HepG2 cells does not affect Myc protein abundance (Figure
S1). Thus, miR-26a does not target the initiating oncogene in tet-o-MYC; LAP-tTA mice,
supporting the use of this model for assessing the general tumor suppressing properties of
miR-26a in vivo.
Development of an AAV vector system to simultaneously express a miRNA and eGFP

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The development of self-complementary AAV (scAAV) vectors and the availability of AAV
serotypes for improved transduction of specific target tissues has expanded the usefulness of
this virus for therapeutic gene delivery (Gao et al., 2002; McCarty, 2008; McCarty et al.,
2003; Nakai et al., 2005; Wang et al., 2003). In particular, these advances allow highly efficient
transduction of hepatocytes following systemic administration of scAAV8 vectors. We
therefore constructed a scAAV vector system to evaluate the therapeutic potential of miR-26a
in tet-o-MYC; LAP-tTA mice. To allow facile assessment of target tissue transduction, the
vector included enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) driven by the ubiquitously
expressed elongation factor 1 alpha (EF1α) promoter. Moreover, since miRNAs are frequently
embedded within introns of both protein-coding and noncoding primary transcripts, we cloned
miR-26a into the short intron which is part of the EF1α promoter unit (Wakabayashi-Ito and
Nagata, 1994), thus allowing simultaneous production of eGFP and miR-26a from a single
transcript (scAAV.miR26a.eGFP; Figure 4A). We confirmed that this vector efficiently
expresses both miR-26a and eGFP by transient transfection of HeLa cells. Northern blotting
demonstrated that the scAAV.miR26a.eGFP vector produced an equivalent amount of mature
miRNA as a control vector in which the miRNA was in an exonic context (scAAV.miR26a;
Figure 4A,B). Fluorescent microscopy of transfected cells similarly documented equivalent
eGFP expression from scAAV.miR26a.eGFP and a control vector lacking intronic miR-26a
sequences (scAAV.eGFP; Figure 4A,C).
scAAV.eGFP and scAAV.miR26a.eGFP were then packaged with the AAV8 serotype for in
vivo delivery. 1×1012 vector genomes (vg) per animal were administered with a single tail-

vein injection and liver tissue was harvested three weeks later for analysis of miRNA and eGFP
expression. As expected, mice transduced with scAAV8.miR26a.eGFP exhibited high-level
expression of miR-26a in the liver (Figure 4D). Fluorescent microscopy documented over 90%
transduction of hepatocytes with both vectors (Figure 4E). Importantly, it has previously been
demonstrated that AAV8-mediated delivery of some short-hairpin RNA (shRNA) constructs
induces acute liver toxicity due to competitive inhibition of the miRNA pathway (Grimm et
al., 2006). scAAV8.miR26a.eGFP administration does not cause these effects, as demonstrated
by normal levels of endogenously-expressed miRNAs in transduced livers (Figure 4D), an
absence of any acute inflammation, fibrosis, or overt histologic evidence of toxicity (Figure
S2), and maintenance of normal levels of serum markers of liver function (ALT, AST, alkaline
phosphatase, total and direct bilirubin) (Table S1). These data demonstrate that scAAV8
provides an effective, non-toxic means to deliver miRNAs to the liver.
Therapeutic delivery of miR-26a suppresses tumorigenesis in tet-o-MYC; LAP-tTA mice

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To assess the therapeutic efficacy of miR-26a delivery for liver cancer, we administered
scAAV8.miR26a.eGFP, or scAAV8.eGFP as a negative control, to tumor-bearing tet-oMYC; LAP-tTA mice. Animals were taken off dox at 4 weeks of age and virus was administered
at 11 weeks of age, a time-point at which animals typically have multiple small to medium size
tumors (Figure 5A, Figure S3). Three weeks later, animals were sacrificed and tumor burden
was assessed. 6 out of 8 mice treated with control virus developed fulminant disease in which
the majority of liver tissue was replaced with tumor tissue (Figure 5B,C, Figure S4). In contrast,
8 of 10 scAAV8.miR26a.eGFP-treated animals were dramatically protected, exhibiting only
small tumors or a complete absence of tumors upon gross inspection (Figure 5B, p < 0.05).
Liver:body weight ratios were significantly lower as well in scAAV8.miR26a.eGFP-treated
versus scAAV8.eGFP-treated animals (p < 0.05), further documenting tumor suppression
(Figure 5D).
Aggressive liver tumors arose in 2 of 10 scAAV8.miR26a.eGFP-treated mice. To investigate
the cause of these treatment failures, we assessed AAV transduction efficiency by scoring GFP
positive hepatocytes and by quantifying transduced vector genomes by qPCR. Interestingly,
these mice exhibited significantly lower transduction efficiency than the successfully treated
animals (Figure S5). This strongly suggests that the development of disease in these animals
was a result of technical failure rather than biologic resistance to miR-26a–mediated tumor
suppression. We conclude that efficient transduction of hepatocytes with
scAAV8.miR26a.eGFP uniformly diminished disease progression in this model.
Delivery of miR-26a reduces cancer cell proliferation and induces tumor-specific apoptosis

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To ascertain the cellular mechanisms underlying miR-26a–mediated tumor suppression, we
first confirmed that scAAV8.miR26a.eGFP effectively delivered the miRNA to tumor cells.
Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) was used to measure miR-26a expression in tumors 5 or
10 days after vector administration (dox off at 4 weeks, virus administered at 11 weeks; 21–
30 tumors analyzed per treatment condition). These studies revealed restoration of physiologic
miR-26a expression in scAAV8.miR26a.eGFP-treated tumors whereas miRNA levels were
unchanged following administration of scAAV8.eGFP (Figure 6A). Fluorescence microscopy
also documented GFP expression in tumor cells, further demonstrating AAV transduction
(Figure 6B).
We next examined cellular proliferation in liver tissue 5, 10, and 21 days following vector
administration. Ki67 staining revealed rapid proliferation of tumor cells at all time-points in
scAAV8.eGFP-treated animals (Figure 7A,B, Figures S6–S7). Consistent with our earlier
demonstration that expression of miR-26a arrests the cell-cycle in HepG2 cells, we observed
markedly reduced Ki67 staining in tumors following administration of

scAAV8.miR26a.eGFP. No difference in Ki67 staining of non-tumor tissue was apparent
between the treatment groups, although baseline Ki67 signal was low in normal liver reflecting
the slow proliferative rate of adult hepatocytes.
Treatment-induced apoptosis was also assessed by TUNEL staining. Apoptotic cells were rare
in normal liver tissue and present at low levels in tumors from scAAV8.eGFP-treated animals
at all time points (Figure 7C,D, Figures S6–S7). Remarkably, AAV-mediated delivery of
miR-26a potently induced apoptosis specifically in tumor cells without measurably causing
death of normal hepatocytes. These data are consistent with our earlier findings that
scAAV8.miR26a.eGFP administration caused no measurable liver toxicity in normal animals
(Figure S2 and Table S1). To further investigate the specificity of miR-26a-induced apoptosis,
we performed TUNEL staining on a broader panel of tissues including those with high
proliferative indices (testis, spleen) and low proliferative indices (heart, lung, kidney, pancreas)
(Figure S8). scAAV8.miR26a.eGFP administration did not cause a measurable increase in the
frequency of apoptotic cells in any of these tissues. Together with the Ki67 data, these results
document that miR-26a-mediated tumor suppression is associated with rapid and sustained
inhibition of cancer cell proliferation and highly-specific induction of tumor cell death.

Discussion
NIH-PA Author Manuscript
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Since the initial discovery of a functional RNA interference (RNAi) system in mammals,
significant effort has been devoted to the development of therapeutics that utilize this pathway
(de Fougerolles et al., 2007). While progress has been made towards the design and delivery
of short interfering (si) and short hairpin (sh) RNAs for therapeutic gene silencing,
accumulating evidence indicates that modulation of miRNA activity also represents an
attractive strategy. miRNAs potently influence cellular behavior through the regulation of
extensive gene expression networks (Baek et al., 2008; Selbach et al., 2008). Therapeutic
modulation of a single miRNA may therefore affect many pathways simultaneously to achieve
clinical benefit. Thus far, most translational in vivo studies targeting miRNAs have aimed to
inhibit miRNA function through the use of antisense reagents such as antagomirs, locked
nucleic acid (LNA) oligomers, and other modified oligonucleotides (Elmen et al., 2008; Esau
et al., 2006; Krutzfeldt et al., 2005). While the in vivo use of synthetic oligonucleotide inhibitors
is promising and will no doubt remain a fruitful area of investigation, the therapeutic delivery
of miRNAs has certain advantages, especially in cancer. It has been demonstrated that most
tumors are characterized by globally diminished miRNA expression (Gaur et al., 2007; Lu et
al., 2005) and that experimental impairment of miRNA processing enhances cellular
transformation and tumorigenesis (Kumar et al., 2007). Additionally, common oncogenic
lesions can result in widespread miRNA repression (Chang et al., 2008). Thus, miRNA delivery
might allow the therapeutic restitution of physiological programs of regulation lost in cancer
and other disease states.
Therapeutic miRNA delivery may have unique technical advantages as well. First, the risk of
off-target gene silencing is likely to be lower than that associated with artificial RNAi triggers
since physiologic gene expression networks have evolved to accommodate the regulatory
effects of endogenous miRNAs. Second, as compared to siRNAs or shRNAs that target a single
transcript, the regulation of hundreds of targets in multiple pathways by miRNAs may reduce
the emergence of resistant clones in diseases such as cancer since many simultaneous mutations
would be required to subvert the effects of miRNA expression. At the same time, however,
miRNA-based therapies will require thorough pre-clinical validation as these broad effects
may in some cases have toxic consequences. Finally, it has been previously shown that the
miRNA biogenesis pathway can be competitively inhibited by the expression of certain
shRNAs, resulting in toxic effects following delivery of these transcripts (Grimm et al.,
2006). This may be due to inefficient processing and/or nuclear-cytoplasmic transport of

shRNA sequences which are not evolutionarily adapted for precise handling by this pathway.
Supporting this notion, shRNA-associated toxicity can be mitigated by placing a shRNA into
a miRNA-like context (McBride et al., 2008). In this study we demonstrated high expression
of an exogenously supplied natural miRNA without toxic effects on endogenous miRNA
biogenesis.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The results described herein demonstrate for the first time that therapeutic delivery of a miRNA
can result in tumor suppression even in a setting where the initiating oncogene is not targeted.
This establishes the principle that miRNAs may be useful as anti-cancer agents through their
ability to broadly regulate cancer cell proliferation and survival. Furthermore, this study design
involved the treatment of existing tumors with a miRNA, a paradigm closely related to the
clinical scenarios in which such therapies would be employed. Finally, we demonstrate highly
specific effects of miRNA delivery on tumor cells without affecting surrounding normal tissue.
Although the molecular basis of this specificity requires further investigation, it is likely that
the high physiologic expression of miR-26a in normal hepatocytes confers tolerance to
exogenous administration of this miRNA. In contrast, the specific reduction of miR-26a in
neoplastic cells and their sensitivity to its restored expression underscores the contribution of
loss-of-function of this miRNA to tumorigenesis in this setting. It is noteworthy that large scale
cloning efforts have documented expression of miR-26a in most mouse and human tissues
(Landgraf et al., 2007), while in situ hybridization data from zebrafish has documented
ubiquitous expression with especially high levels in the head, spinal cord, and gut (Wienholds
et al., 2005). The widespread expression of this miRNA is consistent with our observation that
systemic AAV-mediated delivery of miR-26a is well-tolerated by many tissues. Overall, our
demonstration that miR-26a delivery potently suppresses even a severe, multifocal model of
carcinogenesis in the absence of measurable toxicity provides proof-of-principle that the
systemic administration of miRNAs may be a clinically viable anti-cancer therapeutic strategy.

In this study, we elected to use an AAV-based vector system, an especially attractive platform
for regulatory RNA delivery (Giering et al., 2008; Grimm and Kay, 2007; McCarty, 2008).
When delivered in viral vectors, miRNAs are continually transcribed, allowing sustained high
level expression in target tissues. The use of tissue-specific promoters could restrict this
expression to particular cell types of interest. Compared to retroviral delivery systems, DNA
viruses such as AAV carry substantially diminished risk of insertional mutagenesis since viral
genomes persist primarily as episomes (Schnepp et al., 2003). Further, the availability of
multiple AAV serotypes allows efficient targeting of many tissues of interest (Gao et al.,
2002; McCarty, 2008). Finally, the general safety of AAV has been well documented, with
clinical trials using this platform already underway (Carter, 2005; Maguire et al., 2008; Park
et al., 2008). Despite these advantages, prior studies have achieved mixed results when
attempting to use AAV vectors to transduce HCC cells in vivo (Peng et al., 2000; Shen et al.,
2008). Our successful use of AAV to treat an animal model of HCC may indicate that tumor
cells are highly sensitive to restored expression of miRNAs, resulting in strong tumor
suppression even with a relatively low number of vector genomes introduced into each cell.
The use of self-complementary vectors may have further enhanced tumor cell transduction and
therapeutic miRNA expression in the present study. Finally, while our findings are most
consistent with miR-26a influencing cancer cell proliferation and survival through a cellautonomous mechanism, transduction of tumor-associated stromal cells may have also
contributed to the observed therapeutic effects through a yet unknown mechanism.
We have previously documented that miR-26 family members suppress tumorigenesis in cMyc-driven B lymphoma cells (Chang et al., 2008) and now extend these findings to the teto-MYC; LAP-tTA HCC model. Our demonstration that a genetically complex human liver
cancer cell line is also susceptible to miR-26a-mediated anti-proliferative effects suggests that
the tumor suppressive activities of this miRNA are not limited to Myc-initiated malignancies.

Several additional lines of evidence further support this notion. Work from our group and others
has revealed a role for miR-26a in the p53 tumor suppressor network as this miRNA is
upregulated in a p53-dependent manner following DNA damage (Chang et al., 2007; Xi et al.,
2006). Additionally, a profiling study of human anaplastic thyroid cancers (ATC) identified
miR-26a as consistently downregulated and demonstrated that transient transfection of this
miRNA significantly impairs proliferation of ATC cells in vitro (Visone et al., 2007).
Moreover, the miR-26a-1-encoding locus at 3p21.3 is contained within a sub-megabase
interval that is frequently deleted in small cell lung carcinomas, renal cell carcinomas, and
breast carcinomas (Kashuba et al., 2004). These observations suggest broad anti-tumorigenic
properties of miR-26 family members in diverse settings. Nevertheless, if future work reveals
that the effectiveness of miR-26 delivery is restricted to settings of Myc dysregulation,
therapeutic delivery of this miRNA may still be beneficial for a large number of cancer subtypes
since hyperactivity of Myc is one of the most common attributes of human cancer cells.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Although miR-26a delivery confers dramatic tumor protection, it is likely that many equally
or more effective miRNAs with therapeutic potential remain to be functionally characterized.
The approach employed in this study provides an experimental framework to identify
additional favorable candidates. We suggest that the most promising miRNAs will, like
miR-26a, be highly expressed in a wide variety of normal tissues, be underexpressed in the
disease state being studied, and, when evaluated using in vitro or in vivo models, demonstrate
specific phenotypic effects in disease cells while sparing normal cells. While there clearly
remains significant work to be done both in identifying such miRNAs and optimizing their
controlled delivery, our findings highlight the therapeutic promise of this approach.

Methods
Cell culture
HEK293, HEK293T, and HeLa cells were cultured in high glucose (4.5g/L) DMEM
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), penicillin, and streptomycin. HepG2 cells
were cultured in EMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, penicillin, and streptomycin.
RNA isolation, Northern blotting, and qPCR
Total RNA was isolated from cultured cells or tissue using Trizol (Invitrogen) according to the
manufacturer’s protocol. Northern blotting was performed as previously described (Hwang et
al., 2007) using Ultrahyb-oligo buffer (Ambion) and oligonucleotide probes perfectly
complementary to the mature miRNA sequences. All membranes were stripped and re-probed
for tRNALys as a loading control. qPCR for miR-26a and 18S rRNA was performed using predesigned Taqman primers and probes (ABI) according to manufacturer’s instructions.

Cell-cycle profiling
5×105 retrovirally-infected HepG2 cells were plated after selection. 24 hours later, cells were
harvested for analysis by propidium iodide (PI) staining and flow cytometry as described
previously (Hwang et al., 2007). For M-phase trapping experiments, 100 ng/mL nocodazole
was added for 24 hours prior to harvesting floating and adherent cells for PI staining.
Western blotting
Antibodies for immunoblotting were as follows: anti-c-Myc mouse monoclonal (clone 9E10;
Zymed), anti-cyclin E1 rabbit polyclonal (Abcam), anti-cyclin E2 rabbit polyclonal (Cell
Signaling), anti-cyclin D2 rabbit polyclonal (Cell Signaling), anti-CDK6 mouse monoclonal
(clone DCS83; Cell Signaling), and anti-a-tubulin mouse monoclonal (clone DM1A;
Calbiochem).

Luciferase reporter assays

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

2.5×105 HepG2 cells were plated in triplicate wells of a 24-well plate and transfected 16 hours
later with 100 ng of the indicated pGL3 3' UTR reporter construct and 5 ng of phRL-SV40
(Promega) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Where indicated, miR-18a or miR-26a mimics (Dharmacon) were co-transfected
at 25 nM final concentration. 24 hours after transfection, cells were lysed and assayed for firefly
and renilla luciferase activity using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega).
Firefly luciferase activity was normalized to renilla luciferase activity for each transfected well.
Data depicted is representative of three independent experiments performed on different days.
Vector delivery
Tet-o-MYC; LAP-tTA mice were maintained on dox-containing food (100 mg/kg) until 4
weeks of age. At 11 weeks of age, AAV was administered at a dose of 1012 vg per animal by
tail vein injection (200 uL total volume) using a 30 gauge ultra-fine insulin syringe. The
Research Institute at Nationwide Children's Hospital Animal Care and Use Committee
approved all housing and surgical procedures.
Analysis of Liver Function Tests

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Four month old C57/BL10 mice (n=5) were dosed with 1012 vg of scAAV8.miR26a.eGFP by
tail vein injection. Blood was collected prior to vector administration and at 3 weeks post
injection from the submandibular vein. Serum analysis was performed by Ani Lytics
(Gaithersburg, MD).
Immunohistochemistry

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Tissues were collected in 10% buffered formalin, embedded in paraffin, and stained in
hematoxylin and eosin following standard procedures. For Ki67 detection, slides were
microwaved for 15 min in 10 mM sodium citrate (pH 6.0), cooled for 20 min at 25°C, and
washed three times (5 minutes each) with PBST (PBS, 0.1%Tween 20). The tissue was
permeabilized by incubating the slides in 1% Triton X-100 in PBS at 4° C for 30 min and then
washed again three times in PBST. After blocking for 1 hour at 25° C in blocking buffer (PBS
containing 10% goat serum and 0.2% Triton X-100), slides were incubated overnight in a
humidity chamber with a mouse anti-human Ki67 monoclonal antibody (BD Biosciences)
diluted 1:100 in blocking buffer. Following another three PBST washes, slides were incubated
with Alexa 594-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody at a 1:200 dilution (Molecular
Probes). Slides were washed and nuclei counter-stained with DAPI. The intensity of the Ki67
signal was quantified using the Olympus Slidebook 4.2 software. TUNEL staining was
performed with the TMR Red In situ cell death detection kit (Roche) according to
manufacturer’s instructions. Quantification of TUNEL positive area was performed using
ImageJ software. For GFP visualization, tissues were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde followed
by an overnight incubation in 30% sucrose incubation and then embedded in OCT compound.

(A) Schematic representation of scAAV vectors used in this study depicting locations of
inverted terminal repeats (ITRs), elongation factor 1 α promoter (EF1α), miRNA (shown in
hairpin form), and enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) open reading frame.
(B) Northern blot of transiently-transfected HeLa cells demonstrating equivalent levels of
miR-26a when expressed from an intronic (scAAV.miR26a.eGFP) or exonic (scAAV.miR26a)
context. Co-transfection with a miR-122a expression plasmid (pcDNA-miR-122a) provided a
control for transfection efficiency while tRNALys levels documented equal loading.
(C) Fluorescent microscopy showing eGFP expression in HeLa cells transiently-transfected
with the indicated AAV vectors.
(D) Northern blots showing expression of miRNAs in livers 21 days following administration
of the indicated AAV vectors.
(E) Fluorescent microscopy showing efficient transduction of hepatocytes, as indicated by
eGFP expression, 21 days following AAV administration.

(A) Time-line of miR-26a therapeutic delivery experiment.
(B) Gross tumor burden of livers from miR-26a-treated and control animals, as determined by
quantification of tumor area using the ImageJ software package. The mean tumor burden in
each treatment group is indicated by horizontal lines. Data points highlighted by asterisks
represent animals that exhibited low AAV transduction efficiency (see Fig. S5). p value
calculated by two-tailed t-test.
(C) Representative images of livers from miR-26a-treated and control animals.
(D) Liver:body weight ratios of miR-26a-treated and control animals. A chi-square statistic
was used to compare the fraction of animals in each treatment group with a liver:body weight
ratio above 0.1 (indicated by horizontal line). Data points highlighted by asterisks represent
animals that exhibited low AAV transduction efficiency (see Fig. S5).

Figure 6. AAV-mediated transduction of tumor cells in tet-o-MYC; LAP-tTA mice

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

(A) Expression of miR-26a in tumors in AAV-transduced animals. qPCR was used to measure
miRNA abundance in tumors 5 or 10 days following administration of scAAV8.eGFP (eGFP)
or scAAV8.miR26a.eGFP (miR26a.eGFP). All values were normalized to 18S rRNA
expression. Normal liver expression and tumor expression lines were derived from qPCR
analysis of miR-26a levels in samples shown in Figure 1A. Each box represents the range of
expression observed. The ends of the boxes represent the 25th and 75th percentiles, the bars
indicate the 10th and 90th percentiles, and the median is depicted by a horizontal line within
the boxes.
