BACKGROUND: The purpose of the current study was to prevent bloodstream infection and invasive fungal infection (IFI) by administering prophylactic antibiotic and antifungal agents during intensive chemotherapy in patients being treated for acute leukemia.
METHODS: Prophylaxis treatment was administered during intensive chemotherapy in children with acute myeloid leukemia (AML)
and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) from January 1, 2010 to December 31, 2012. Oral ciprofloxacin (at a dose of 300 mg/m2/12
hours) was administered after chemotherapy when a patient with AML or ALL became neutropenic and > 7 days of neutropenia was
expected. Voriconazole (at a dose of 4 mg/kg/12 hours) was initiated at the onset of neutropenia in patients with AML and after 7
days of neutropenia in patients with ALL. Micafungin (at a dose of 2 mg/kg/day) was substituted for voriconazole when patients
with ALL received vincristine. Prophylaxis treatment was discontinued when the absolute neutrophil count recovered to > 100/lL. All
episodes of bloodstream infection, IFI, febrile neutropenia, and intensive care unit stays related to severe infection occurring between
January 1, 2005 and December 31, 2012 were recorded. RESULTS: During the preprophylaxis period, 62 children with ALL and 24 children with AML experienced a total of 44 episodes of bloodstream infection and 22 episodes of IFI. Seven patients died of severe
infection. In contrast, in the prophylaxis period, 10 episodes of bloodstream infection occurred and no IFIs were reported to occur in
51 patients with ALL and 14 patients with AML. Moreover, no patient died of severe infection. Episodes of febrile neutropenia and intensive care unit stay were significantly reduced during the prophylaxis period. CONCLUSIONS: Prophylaxis with ciprofloxacin and
voriconazole or micafungin was found to reduce the rates of bloodstream infection and IFI in children with acute leukemia underC 2014 American Cancer Society.

INTRODUCTION
Bloodstream infection and invasive fungal infection (IFI) are the most life-threatening complications and remain frequent
causes of treatment failure in children with acute leukemia who are undergoing chemotherapy. Patients with severe infections, especially IFI, have to receive weeks to months of medical and/or surgical treatment and may experience long-term
morbidities even if their antifungal or antibacterial therapies are successful. Often, chemotherapy is these patients is
delayed, which can lead to an increased risk of leukemia recurrence.1 Based on these concerns, decreasing the rate of severe
infection may reduce infection-related mortality and improve long-term survival rates for those undergoing cancer treatment.2 To the best of our knowledge, there have been few reports of prophylaxis with antibiotic and antifungal agents in
children with cancer who are receiving chemotherapy or hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT), which can decrease
the rates of bloodstream infection3 and IFI.4,5 However, to our knowledge, there has been a lack of pediatric studies

For patients with childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who are receiving intensive chemotherapy, prophylaxis with
antibiotic and antifungal agents can significantly reduce the rate of life-threatening infections in patients with ALL who are undergoing induction chemotherapy,
bloodstream infections in patients with AML who are being treated with high-dose chemotherapy, and invasive fungal infections in patients with AML who are
receiving modest-dose chemotherapy. Prophylaxis regimens also have been found to reduce the number of episodes of febrile neutropenia, the length of stay in
the intensive care unit for patients with ALL, mortality caused by severe infections in patients with AML, and cost.

focused on preventing bloodstream infection and IFI
using prophylaxis therapy in children with newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML).
The primary objective of the current study was to
investigate the effectiveness of prophylaxis with antibiotic
and antifungal agents in the prevention of bloodstream
infection and IFI during intensive chemotherapy for acute
leukemia. A secondary aim was to assess the impact of
prophylaxis with antibiotic and antifungal agents on febrile neutropenia, days of intensive care unit (ICU) stay,
changes in antibiotic resistance, and medical cost during
chemotherapy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Design and Patients

We conducted this single-center cohort study at the
Mackay Memorial Hospital in Taipei, Taiwan. Between
January 1, 2005 and December 31, 2012, a total of 113
children with newly diagnosed ALL and 36 patients with
nonacute promyelocytic leukemia AML who were
aged < 18 years were treated after written informed consent
was obtained from their guardians. Patients with acute leukemia who were receiving stem cell transplantation and
those with recurrent leukemia were not enrolled in the
study. From January 1, 2010 to December 31, 2012, prophylaxis with antibiotic and antifungal agents was administered to nonfebrile neutropenic patients with ALL who
underwent induction, consolidation, or reinduction chemotherapy, or those with AML who received induction as
well as postremission high-dose and modest-dose chemotherapy. All episodes of bloodstream infection and IFI that
occurred during the preprophylaxis period (2005-2009)
and prophylaxis period (January 1, 2010-December 31,
2012) were analyzed. Pathogens, days of ICU stay, death,
pharmaceutical costs due to bloodstream infection and IFI,
and resistance to ciprofloxacin of the major gram-negative
organisms at the study institution were analyzed to compare the preprophylaxis and the prophylaxis periods. Caspofungin and voriconazole were introduced to the study
institution in mid-2004. We have been investigating the
treatment results of patients with IFIs and the pharmaceutical cost based on treatment with these antifungal agents
since 2005. Accordingly, we had a preprophylaxis period of
5 years.
Chemotherapy for Patients With ALL and AML

Patients with newly diagnosed ALL were stratified into
standard-risk, high-risk, or very high-risk according to
age, initial white blood cell counts, immunophenotype,
1256

cytogenetic abnormalities, and other prognostic factors at
the time of diagnosis. They received treatment according
to the Taiwan Pediatric Oncology Group-ALL-2002 protocol (activated in January 2002) consisting of induction,
consolidation, reinduction, and continuation chemotherapy.6 Patients with newly diagnosed nonacute promyelocytic leukemia AML were treated with the Taiwan
Pediatric Oncology Group-AML-97A protocol (activated
in January 1997) consisting of induction chemotherapy and
postremission high-dose and modest-dose chemotherapy.7
Administration of Prophylactic Antibiotic and
Antifungal Agents

Oral ciprofloxacin (at a dose of 300 mg/m2/12 hours) was
administered when a nonfebrile patient became neutropenic (an absolute neutrophil count  500/lL) and
when > 7 days of neutropenia was expected during intensive
chemotherapy. Oral voriconazole (at a dose of 4 mg/kg/12
hours)3 was initiated at the onset of neutropenia in
patients with AML and after 7 days of neutropenia in
patients with ALL. Intravenous micafungin (at a dose of
2 mg/kg/day, maximum dose of 50 mg)4,8 was substituted
for voriconazole when patients with ALL were receiving
induction and reinduction chemotherapy to avoid interaction with vincristine. Therapeutic drug monitoring was
not performed in patients receiving voriconazole prophylaxis. Prophylaxis with antibiotic and antifungal agents
was discontinued when the absolute neutrophil count
recovered to > 100/lL. Patients with AML are able to
receive prophylaxis treatment at home, whereas patients
with ALL require hospitalization until the discontinuation of prophylaxis. Bloodstream infection was defined as
the isolation of bacteria from blood cultures, and clinical
signs of systemic infection. If a common skin microorganism (eg, methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci) was isolated from at least 2 blood cultures, it was
recorded as a true pathogen.9 IFI was defined as fungemia
and/or visceral dissemination of fungus.10 IFI was diagnosed according to the body fluid culture or histology of
infected tissue. Patients with a probable fungal infection
(1 in the preprophylaxis period and none in the prophylaxis period) were not enrolled for analysis.
At the study institution, management strategies for a
patient with febrile neutropenia included 2 blood cultures
for bacteria obtained via the central venous catheter (if
present) and a peripheral vein. Cefuroxime and amikacin
(administered for  5 days) were used as empirical antibiotics. Two blood cultures for bacteria/fungus and an
Aspergillus galactomannan antigen assay were obtained
once fever persisted after 3 to 5 days of therapy with

antibiotics or if fever recurred after defervescence by
empiric antibiotics. Chest radiograph and abdominal
sonogram were performed to rule out fungal infections
with visceral dissemination. Chest computed tomography
was not part of the routine workup of persistently febrile
neutropenic patients. During the prophylaxis period,
ciprofloxacin was withdrawn while voriconazole or micafungin prophylaxis continued once patients experienced
febrile neutropenia. Computed tomography was performed once there was suspicion of a fungal infection with
visceral dissemination based on the findings of chest radiography and/or abdominal sonogram or the patient having fungemia. Surgical resection of lung lesions was
performed once patients with persistent lesions had recovered from neutropenia.
Assessment of the Expense of Antibacterial and
Antifungal Agents

The costs of treatment with antibiotic and antifungal
agents in patients with bloodstream infections and IFIs
who received prophylaxis with antibiotic and antifungal
agents were calculated. Total costs of antibiotic and antifungal agents were analyzed to determine the cost savings
of the treatment and the prevention of bloodstream infections and IFIs between the preprophylaxis and prophylaxis periods. The cost was expressed as US dollars (US$),
and was adjusted for inflation of the currency yearly. The
exchange rate is US&dollar1 to 29.8 Taiwan dollars.
Assessment of Ciprofloxacin Resistance

The ciprofloxacin resistance for the most common 8
gram-negative pathogens at the study institution from
2005 to 2012 was recorded. The results for every bacterium were compared individually between the preprophylaxis and prophylaxis periods. We focused on the change
in ciprofloxacin resistance of the gram-negative bacteria
during the study period.
Assessment of Safety and Tolerability

Treatment-related clinical and laboratory adverse events
were registered, analyzed, and graded according to the
current Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse
Events of the National Cancer Institute.11 Patients were
evaluated at least twice daily for clinical signs and symptoms. Blood samples included complete blood counts,
and chemistry parameters were obtained at least twice a
week during the prophylaxis period.
Statistical Analysis

and IFIs and mortality from infections based on

chemotherapy courses between the 2 periods were estimated using the Fisher exact test. The Mann-Whitney U
test was used to compare the episodes of febrile neutropenia and the Student t test was used for patient age and
days of ICU stay due to severe infection. Sex and ciprofloxacin resistance for bacteria were estimated by the chisquare test. Kaplan-Meier estimates were used to plot
overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS). A P
value < .05 was considered to be statistically significant.
SPSS statistical software (version 17; SPSS Inc, Chicago,
Ill) was used to perform the statistical analyses.
RESULTS
During the preprophylaxis period, 62 patients with ALL
received a total of 62 courses of induction, 59 courses of
consolidation, and 92 courses of reinduction chemotherapy; for the 51 patients with ALL during the prophylaxis
period, the number of courses were 51, 50, and 79, respectively. There were 19 episodes of bloodstream infection
and 10 episodes of IFI reported during the preprophylaxis
period, of which 15 bloodstream infections and 9 IFIs
occurred during remission induction chemotherapy
(Table 1). One patient died of invasive candidiasis. In
contrast, only 5 episodes of bloodstream infections
occurred during induction therapy and no IFI developed
during the prophylaxis period. All episodes of bloodstream infection and IFI occurred during periods of neutropenia. Rates of bloodstream infection and IFI were
significantly decreased in patients with ALL who were
receiving induction chemotherapy during the prophylaxis
period. A total of 96 episodes of febrile neutropenia
occurred in 50 patients during the preprophylaxis period
whereas 24 episodes were reported to occur in 19 patients
during the prophylaxis period. Nine patients had a total
of 105 days of ICU stay due to a severe infection during
the preprophylaxis period whereas no patient with a severe
infection required ICU care during the prophylaxis
period. The difference in the reduction of episodes of
febrile neutropenia and length of ICU stay related to
severe infection was statistically significant. The overall
mortality rates during intensive chemotherapy in the
preprophylaxis and prophylaxis periods were 6.5% and
2%, respectively. At the time of last follow-up (June 30,
2013), the EFS rate was 78% 6 9% (standard error) and
the OS rate was 86% 6 5% for 62 patients during the preprophylaxis period; for 51 patients during the prophylaxis
period, the rates were 87% 6 6.5% and 98% 6 2%,
respectively, with a median of 21 months (range, 5
months-38 months) after the completion of intensive
chemotherapy.

During the preprophylaxis period, 24 patients with
AML received a total of 28 courses of induction, 76
courses of postremission high-dose, and 56 courses of
postremission modest-dose chemotherapy; for 14 patients
with AML during the prophylaxis period, the number of
courses were 18, 55, and 36, respectively. There were 25
episodes of bloodstream infection and 12 episodes of IFI
that occurred during the preprophylaxis period, whereas
only 5 episodes of bloodstream infection and no IFIs
developed during the prophylaxis period. All episodes of
bloodstream infection and IFI occurred during neutropenia. The decrease in the rates of bloodstream infection in
patients with AML who were receiving high-dose chemotherapy and IFI in those receiving modest-dose chemotherapy reached a statistically significant level. A total of
135 episodes of febrile neutropenia occurred during the
1258

preprophylaxis period compared with 48 episodes during
the prophylaxis period. Seven patients with AML died of
infection during the preprophylaxis period (3 of bloodstream infections and 4 of IFIs), whereas no patient died
of a severe infection during the prophylaxis period. Mortality from infection and the frequency of febrile neutropenia were reduced significantly during the prophylaxis
period. The overall mortality rates during intensive chemotherapy in the preprophylaxis and prophylaxis periods
were 25% and 7%, respectively. At the time of last followup (June 30, 2013), the EFS rate was 50% 6 11% and the
OS rate was 60% 6 20% in the preprophylaxis period; for
14 patients during the prophylaxis period, the rates were
55% 6 11% and 68% 6 16%, respectively, with a median of 7 months (range, 0.3 months-33 months) after the
completion of intensive chemotherapy.

The duration and number of chemotherapy courses
in patients receiving the prophylaxis treatment are shown
in Table 2. Each patient with AML received ciprofloxacin
prophylaxis for a median of 46 days and voriconazole prophylaxis for a median of 55 days during chemotherapy.
Only 2 patients with ALL did not receive prophylaxis
with ciprofloxacin. The other 49 patients with ALL
received ciprofloxacin prophylaxis for a median of 15 days
during their induction, consolidation, and reinduction
chemotherapy. Thirty-eight patients with ALL received
micafungin prophylaxis for a median of 10 days.
All episodes of bloodstream infection occurring in the
preprophylaxis and prophylaxis periods are summarized in
Table 3. Methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci and Klebsiella pneumoniae were the leading grampositive and gram-negative organisms in the preprophylaxis
period, respectively, compared with Streptococcus viridans
and Escherichia coli–extended-spectrum beta-lactamase during
the prophylaxis period. There were no multiresistant gramnegative organisms found to be a cause of bloodstream
infection in patients receiving ciprofloxacin prophylaxis.
Three patients with AML died of a bloodstream infection
during the preprophylaxis period (2 of Enterobacter cloacae
and 1 of Acinetobacter baumannii), whereas no patient died
of a bloodstream infection during the prophylaxis period.
There were 22 episodes of IFI in the preprophylaxis period,
12 in patients with AML and 10 in patients with ALL. Candida species were the leading pathogens (15 of 22 episodes;
68%), followed by Aspergillus species in 6 episodes (27%).
Four patients with AML and 1 patient with ALL died of IFI
during the preprophylaxis period.

During the preprophylaxis period, the cost of antibiotics for bloodstream infections and antifungal agents for
IFIs in patients with ALL was US$17,467 and
US$235,373, respectively; in patients with AML, the cost
was US$36,523 and US$561,642, respectively. During
the prophylaxis period, the cost of antibiotics for the treatment of bloodstream infections and for prophylaxis in
patients with ALL was US$8261 and US$25,282, respectively. For antifungal agent prophylaxis for patients with
AML, the cost was US$ 2685 and US$ 35,098, respectively. We spent US$173,086 on antibiotic and antifungal
agents for the treatment of severe infections each year in
the preprophylaxis period and US$23,775 for treatment
and prophylaxis each year during the prophylaxis period.
The ciprofloxacin resistance of the most common 8
gram-negative bacilli at the study institution from 2005
to 2012 is shown in Table 4. The ciprofloxacin resistance
of E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa,
and Serratia marcescens was significantly reduced during
the prophylaxis period. The other 4 gram-negative bacilli
did not change with regard to ciprofloxacin resistance
between the 2 periods.
With regard to drug toxicity, 15 patients (39%) had
hepatotoxicity with elevated transaminase levels and/or
hyperbilirubinemia during prophylaxis with micafungin,
including 10 patients with grade 1 and 5 patients with
grade 2 toxicity, leading to a dose reduction in 3 patients
or the early discontinuation of micafungin in 7 patients.
The median aspartate aminotransferase level was 90 U/L
(range, 44 U/L-981 U/L) and the median alanine aminotransferase level was 254 U/L (range, 69 U/L-2115 U/L);

the median duration from the initiation of micafungin to
the development of hepatotoxicity was 11 days (range, 4
days-17 days) in those developing hepatotoxicity. No renal toxicity or hypokalemia were observed during micafungin prophylaxis. The hepatic function values were
normalized at a median of 6 days (range, 2 days-15 days)
after discontinuation of micafungin. Four patients (3%)
developed grade 1 and 2 patients (2%) developed grade 2
hepatotoxicity during voriconazole prophylaxis.
DISCUSSION
There are several findings from the current study. First, in
patients with ALL, especially those receiving induction
therapy, prophylaxis treatment effectively decreased the
occurrence of both bloodstream infections and IFIs as
well as febrile neutropenia and the length of ICU stay
1260

related to severe infections. Second, in patients with
AML, prophylaxis treatment can reduce the rates of
bloodstream infections and IFIs, febrile neutropenia, and
mortality caused by severe infection. Third, the costs of
prophylaxis treatment and antibiotics for the treatment of
bloodstream infections during the prophylaxis period are
significantly lower than those for the treatment of bloodstream infections and IFIs during the preprophylaxis period. Moreover, the costs for patients with AML who
underwent chemotherapy demonstrated a significant
reduction during the prophylaxis period. Finally, we demonstrated no increase in the rate of ciprofloxacin resistance
during the prophylaxis period.
Ciprofloxacin and voriconazole were selected as the
prophylactic agents because their oral formulation can be
easily administered at home and did not cause prolonged

hospitalization after chemotherapy. Breakthrough fungal
infections with fluconazole prophylaxis occurred but voriconazole demonstrated more effectiveness in preventing
IFI in patients after HSCT.12,13 These reasons support
our choice of voriconazole. However, azole derivatives
may block the cytochrome P450 liver subfamily and consequently delay the metabolism of vinca alkaloids thereby
leading to increased toxicity of vinca alkaloids.14 In
patients with ALL who were receiving treatment with
vinca alkaloids, an echinocandin (micafungin) was used.
We selected micafungin as a prophylaxis agent because it
had been studied in children and neonates.15 Another important consideration was the cost of micafungin, which is
cheaper than the other 2 echinocandins, caspofungin and
anidulafungin.
Changes in the ciprofloxacin resistance of bacteria
must be monitored during the prophylaxis period.
According to a previous study, there was a significant
increase in the rate of ciprofloxacin-resistant gram-negative organisms.16-18 The rate of ciprofloxacin-resistant E.
coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and
Serratia marcescens significantly decreased during the prophylaxis period, whereas there was no change noted for
Acinetobacter baumannii, Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus
mirabilis, and Salmonella species. The number of patients
who received ciprofloxacin prophylaxis was relatively
small compared with all hospitalized patients, and therefore the impact on the development of ciprofloxacinresistant organisms might be quite minimal. However,
because there was only a 3-year observation of prophylaxis
agents, conclusions regarding the development of
ciprofloxacin-resistant organisms cannot be made. We
have tried to maintain ciprofloxacin resistance by administering other antimicrobials (eg, cephalosporin and aminoglycoside) when patients are found to have gramnegative bacterial infections and preserving ciprofloxacin

as a second-line antibiotic. We closely monitor for any
changes in antimicrobial resistance every 6 months in the
study institution.
Micafungin has shown to be effective in the treatment of IFI in patients with febrile neutropenia.19 It was
approved in Europe as a prophylaxis treatment to prevent
Candida infections in adult and pediatric patients who
underwent HSCT or patients who were expected to have
neutropenia for at least 10 days. Committees from the Infectious Diseases Society of America have recommended
micafungin prophylaxis for SCT recipients with neutropenia.20 The dosage of micafungin for prophylaxis in
patients weighing < 50 kg who are undergoing HSCT
varied from 1 mg/day to 3 mg/kg/day, whereas heavier
patients received a fixed dosage of 50 mg/day.4,8,21 In pediatric patients with invasive candidiasis, micafungin at a
dose of 2 mg/kg is effective and as safe as liposomal
amphotericin B.22 In the current study, 7 patients (18%)
had elevated transaminase levels of grade 3 or 4. Although
to the best of our knowledge there is no evidence regarding the pharmacokinetic relationship between hepatotoxicity and the dose of micafungin used, we recently
reduced the dose of micafungin administered in the study
institution to 1 mg/kg/day8 in an attempt to decrease
hepatotoxicity.
In the current study of patients with childhood ALL
and AML who were receiving intensive chemotherapy,
prophylaxis with antibiotic and antifungal agents was
found to significantly reduce the rate of bloodstream
infections and IFIs in patients with ALL who were undergoing induction chemotherapy, bloodstream infections in
patients with AML who were being treated with highdose chemotherapy, and IFIs in patients with AML who
were being treated with modest-dose chemotherapy. Prophylaxis also reduced the episodes of febrile neutropenia,
the length of ICU stay in patients with ALL, and the

mortality caused by severe infections in patients with

reduced by prophylaxis.
