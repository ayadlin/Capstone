ABSTRACT
While the epidemiologic association between hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection
and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is established, little is known more than
this epidemiologic evidence. We studied a cohort of 587 patients with DLBCL for HBV
infection status, clinicopathologic features, and the immunoglobulin variable region in
HBV surface antigen (HBsAg)-positive patients. Eighty-one (81/587, 13.8%) patients
were HBsAg-positive. Compared with HBsAg-negative DLBCL, HBsAg-positive DLBCL
displayed a younger median onset age (45 vs. 55 years), more frequent involvement
of spleen or retroperitoneal lymph node (40.7% vs. 16.0% and 61.7% vs. 31.0%
respectively, both p < 0.001), more advanced disease (stage III/IV: 76.5% vs
59.5%, p = 0.003), and significantly worse outcome (2-year overall survival: 47%
versus 70%, p < 0.001). In HBsAg-positive DLBCL patients, almost all (45/47, 96%)
amino acid sequences of heavy and light chain complementarity determining region 3
exhibited a high homology to antibodies specific for HBsAg, and the majority (45/50,
90%) of IgHV and IgLV genes were mutated. We conclude that 13.8% of DLBCL
cases are HBV-associated in HBV-endemic China and show unique clinical features
and poor outcomes. Furthermore, our study strongly suggests that HBV-associated
DLBCL might arise from HBV antigen-selected B cells.

40,000 cases of NHL and 1,660,000 cases of control
were included, showed that HBV-infected individuals
had an odd ratio of 2.24 (95% confidence interval
1.80–2.78; P ≤ 0.001) of developing NHL [9]. With
regard to the NHL subtypes, a firm association was
found with B-cell NHL, especially with diffuse large
B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), the most common subtype
of B-cell NHL, but not with T-cell NHL [9]. In HBV
prevalent countries, the odd ratio of DLBCL in HBVinfected individuals was 2.73 (95% confidence interval
1.62–4.59; P ≤ 0.001) [9].

INTRODUCTION
As early as in 1970s, the detection of hepatitis B 
surface antigen (HBsAg) in the hepatocytes of some
patients with lymphoproliferative disorders was reported
and first suggested this association [1, 2]. Since then,
an epidemiologic association between HBV infection
and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) was confirmed
by a large number of retrospective or prospective, casecontrol or cohort studies, as well as two meta-analyses
[3–9]. A  most recent meta-analysis, in which over

Such an association between HBV and NHL
would parallel that between another subtype of hepatitis
virus, hepatitis C virus (HCV) and NHL [10, 11]. With
a histologic predominance of DLBCL and marginal-zone
lymphoma, HCV-associated lymphomas often involve
spleen or target organs of HCV infection such as liver and
salivary glands [10, 11]. Possible mechanisms of HCVinduced lymphoma-genesis are chronic viral antigen
stimulation, an interaction between HCV-E2 and CD81
expressed on B-cells, and direct HCV infection of B-cells.
Among these putative mechanisms, chronic viral antigen
stimulation is the most plausible mechanism [10, 11].
Ironically, although HBV infection is more prevalent
than HCV, other than the epidemiologic association, little is
known regarding both clinical features and pathogenesis of
HBV-associated lymphoma [12]. Because the anti-B-cell
therapy with rituximab has increased the risk of HBV
reactivation, the prophylaxis and management of
this complication has become a major issue in the
management of B-cell lymphoma patients with chronic
HBV infection  [13]. In contrast, much less attention
has been paid to the lymphoma itself in these patients.
The treatment for HBsAg-positive DLBCL patients
is largely similar to that for HBsAg-negative DLBCL
patients except additional antiviral prophylaxis. Both the
clinicopathologic features of HBV-associated lymphoma
and the possible pathogenic mechanism of HBV in
lymphoma remain largely unclear [10].
China is an endemic area for the HBV infection with
a HBsAg-positive rate of 7.18% in the general population
and about 93 million chronically-infected patients
[14,  15]. The high prevalence of HBV infection could
represent a unique opportunity to study the association
between HBV and lymphoma [9]. By retrospectively
analyzing the clinical data of a cohort of 587 patients
with DLBCL, we found HBsAg-positive DLBCL patients
presented unique clinical features and had significantly
poor outcome. Our further analysis of immunoglobulin
(Ig) heavy and light chain variable region genes in
HBsAg-positive DLBCL patients subsequently strongly
suggests that HBV-associated DLBCL might arise from
HBV antigen-selected B cells.

for the whole group, and was 27 months (range 1–116)
for HBsAg-positive group and 43 months for HBsAgnegative group (range 1–135).

HBV infection status and unique clinical features
of HBsAg-positive DLBCL patients
The HBV infection status of those 81 HBsAgpositive DLBCL patients were classified into three groups
based on the viral markers including HBV DNA loads, the
alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase levels,
and the ultrasonography or computerized tomography
(CT) of liver [16]. The majority (56/81, 69.1%) were
HBV carriers; ten patients had chronic hepatitis B; and
15 patients were diagnosed as hepatitis B cirrhosis,
13 (86.7%) of which were compensated cirrhosis. Fortyeight of the 81 (59.3%) patients had a documented
history of chronic HBV infection and half of them have
had disease for more than 20 years. Only one of the
242 HBsAg-negative and HBcAb-positive patients was
positive for HBeAg.
Compared with patients in HBsAg-negative group,
patients in HBsAg-positive group displayed younger age
with a median age of 45 years (range 16–78) vs 55 years
(range 9–90) in the HBsAg-negative group (Figure 1).
The majority of patients in the HBsAg-positive group
were in the age from 36 to 55 years (54.3% versus 34.0%)
and fewer were over 55 years (25.9% versus 48.0%).
DLBCL in HBsAg-positive group showed more frequent
involvement of spleen or retroperitoneal lymph node
(40.7% vs. 16.0% and 61.7% vs. 31.0% respectively, both
p < 0.001), more advanced disease (stage III/IV: 76.5%
vs 59.5%, p = 0.003), B symptoms (58.0% vs 36.2%,
p  <  0.001), high International Prognostic Index (IPI)
(IPI ≥ 3: 42.0% vs 30.6%, p = 0.043) and elevated lactate
dehydrogenase (LDH: 58.0% vs 40.5%, p = 0.003).

Poor outcome of HBsAg-positive
DLBCL patients
Patients in HBsAg-positive group showed
significantly worse OS and PFS than those in the HBsAgnegative group with 2-year OS of 47% vs 70% and 2-year
PFS of 36% vs 61% (both p < 0.001, Figure 2A and 2B),
and 5-year OS of 44% vs 61% and 5-year PFS of 36%
vs 55% ( p = 0.012 and 0.005 respectively). For HBsAgpositive DLBCL patients, once spleen or retroperitoneal
lymph node were involved, the 2-year survival was lower
than 40% (Figure 2C and 2D). In HBsAg-positive DLBCL
group (Table 2), there was a strong trend that the response
in the R-CHOP group was better than that in the CHOP
group with a higher rate of complete response (57.6% vs
22.9%, p = 0.051). However, progressive disease (PD)
occurred in about 40% of the patients in both groups.
Moreover, 59.6% of the PD occurred within 6 months and
82.4% occurred within 12 months after the initiation of

Baseline characteristics
The baseline clinical characteristics of the
587  patients are shown in Table 1. Eighty-one patients
were HBsAg-positive (81/587, 13.8%) and 506 (86.2%)
were HBsAg-negative. Of HBsAg-negative patients,
8 were  HCV-positive. All patients were HIV-negative.
Thirty-three of the 81 (40.7%) HBsAg-positive and 271
of the 506 (53.6%) HBsAg-negative DLBCL patients were
treated with R-CHOP and others were treated with CHOP.
The median follow-up time was 41 months (range 1–135)

toward a better PFS and the OS in the HBsAg-positive
DLBCL patients treated with R-CHOP compared with
those with CHOP (Figure 2E and 2F, p = 0.065 and 0.075,
respectively). By analysis, 44 of the 81 HBsAg-positive
patients died and the only cause of death was lymphoma;
180 of the 506 HBsAg-negative patients died, 164 of them
died from lymphoma and the other 16 patients died from

DLBCL patients were further categorized as HBcAbpositive and HBcAb-negative groups, there was a trend

29 IGKV-J rearrangements were detected and all of them
were productive. Among them, two cases carried both
potentially functional IGKV-J and IGLV-J rearrangements.
Nonfunctional IGLV-J rearrangements were detected in
another two patients.
As shown in Table 3 and Table 4, the most frequent
IGHV gene was IGHV4-34 (8/19, 42.1%) in our cohort.
In the remaining 11 cases, 6 cases (31.6%) used IGHV1
and 5 (26.3%) used IGHV3 family genes. A stronger
bias at the level of IGKV gene usage was observed with
IGKV4-1 in 19/29 (65.5%) cases. As shown in Table 3
and Table 4, 13 of 19 (68.4%) IGHV genes were highly
mutated, 3 (15.8%) minimally/borderlinely mutated,
and 3 (15.8%) truly unmutated. Except two minimally/
borderlinely mutated IGKV sequences, all the IGKV and
IGLV sequences were highly mutated.

survival analysis, both PFS and OS showed no difference
between HBV-DNA-positive and HBV-DNA-negative
patients.

Cell of origin and outcome in HBsAg-positive
DLBCL patients
Thirty-three cases (33/49, 67.3%) in HBsAgpositive group compared with 53 (53/93, 56.9%) in
HBsAg-negative and HBcAb-negative group were
classified as non-germinal center B-cell (non-GCB)like respectively. There was no significant difference in
the percentage of non-GCB between these two groups
( p = 0.24). For the 49 HBsAg-positive DLBCL patients,
PFS and OS did not differ between the GCB and non-GCB
subtypes (Supplemental Figure 1A and 1B, p = 0.956 and
0.945, respectively).

Interestingly, 19 of 27 (70.5%) kappa chain CDR3
(KCDR3) sequences were highly homologous and met
the criteria for stereotyped rearrangements and 14 of the
19 sequences were identical. A specific combination of
IGKV4-1 and IGKJ4 usage was also observed in these
19 patients.
Notably, the HCDR3 sequences exhibited a
high homology to antibodies specific for HBsAg in
15 of 16 patients, and for HBcAg in the remaining one
patient. Furthermore, the KCDR3 sequences in 28 of 29
patients (96.6%) and the lambda chain CDR3 (LCDR3)
sequences in 2 patients also showed the highest homology
to antibodies specific for HBsAg. In 9 HBsAg-positive
DLBCL patients, both heavy and light chain CDR3
sequences were obtained and all presented a high
homology to HBsAb.

patients was reported by studies from both Korea [3] and
China [18, 19, 21]. A more advanced stage and frequent
involvement of spleen in HBsAg-positive DLBCL
patients were also reported by Wang et al. [18], but not
by others [17, 19, 20, 22]. The discrepancy might be
ascribed to the small sample sizes [17, 22], different
prevalence of HBV infection, and inclusion of T-cell
lymphoma which is less frequently associated with HBV
infection [17, 23].
Most importantly, consistent with the results
in two previous studies from China [18, 20, 21], our
study showed HBsAg-positive DLBCL patients had a
significantly poor outcome. Although the high risk factors
associated with worse outcome, such as advanced disease,
higher IPI and LDH (shown in Supplemental Table 1),
were observed in HBsAg-positive DLBCL patients, they
were related to the tumor biology itself but not caused by a
biased patient selection because our cohort is a consecutive
cohort. Further analysis showed that the poor outcome
of HBsAg-positive DLBCL patients was mainly due to
early PD. In our study, PD occurred in about 40% of the
HBsAg-positive DLBCL patients, treated with or without
rituximab. On the other hand, although HBsAg-positive
DLBCL patients had a higher risk of developing hepatic
dysfunction and HBV reactivation during anti-tumor
therapy [13], the hepatic dysfunction higher than grade 2
and HBV reactivation both occurred in only 6.2% of
HBsAg-positive DLBCL patients. All these complications
were under control without causing death, thus contributed
little to the poor outcome.
DLBCL can be stratified into GCB and non-GCB
subtypes by immunohistochemistry, and patients with
non-GCB subtype have an inferior prognosis [24]. We
identified 67.3% in HBsAg-positive group and 56.9% in
both HBsAg- and HBcAb-negative group as non-GCB
subtype, without a significant difference between these
two groups. In addition, for HBsAg-positive DLBCL
patients, PFS and OS did not differ between the GCB
and non-GCB subtypes. Thus, our study did not find a
significant representation of cell of origin subtype in
HBsAg-positive DLBCL, which may have an influence in
the prognosis. However, due to the small sample size and

DISCUSSION
In this study, we analyzed a consecutive cohort of
587 DLBCL patients from China, a HBV prevalent area.
Our study showed that HBsAg-positive patients accounted
for 13.8% of the whole cohort and might be a unique
subset of DLBCL based on its clinical features and poor
outcome. Additionally, we provide evidence for the first
time that chronic HBV-associated antigen stimulation
might play an important role in the pathogenesis of this
subset of DLBCL by analysis of immunoglobulin variable
region genes.
Previous studies from China and Singapore,
another Asian country also with intermediate prevalence
of HBV, have reported that 13.3% to 30.9% of DLBCL
patients were HBsAg-positive, similar or even higher
than the 13.8% in our study [17–20]. These results
suggested that in HBV prevalent region, a certain
percentage of DLBCL patients were chronically infected
with HBV. We further found HBsAg-positive DLBCL
patients showed unique clinical features, including
an earlier disease onset age, a narrow range of onset
age, a much more common involvement of spleen
and retroperitoneal lymph nodes, and more advanced
disease. An earlier disease onset age in HBsAg-positive

without using the gold standard cell of origin classification
by gene-expression profile, further studies on cell of origin
in HBsAg-positive patients are needed.
Interestingly, our clinical data provided clues
that these HBsAg-positive DLBCLs may result from
chronic HBV-associated antigen stimulation based on
three aspects. First, about 60% of the HBsAg-positive
patients had a long history of chronic HBV infection;
Secondly, the majority of HBsAg-positive DLBCL was
developed between an age from 35 to 50, suggesting
that the development of lymphoma needs a long time of
chronic antigen stimulation; Thirdly, B-cells in spleen and
retroperitoneal lymph nodes deal with antigen from blood
circulation and from portal venous system respectively,
which is consistent with the distribution of HBV-associated
antigen. In fact, chronic antigen stimulation either as a
result of infection or autoimmune disease, was commonly
associated with some B-cell NHLs [25]. The two common
clinical characteristics of these lymphomas were longterm history of infection or autoimmune diseases and
specific involvement sites, which were also found in our
HBV-associated DLBCL patients.
This hypothesis was substantiated by analysis
of immunoglobulin variable region gene segments in
subsets of HBsAg-positive patients. In our study, we first
found a strongly biased usage of both Ig heavy and light
chain genes in HBsAg-positive DLBCL, with individual
IGHV4-34 and IGKV4-1 accounting for 42.1% and 65.5%
respectively, both of which were much higher than that in
normal peripheral blood B-cells and B-cell NHLs [26–30].
Of note, the IGHV4-34 is known to play a role in viral
infections and autoimmunity and IGHV4-34 using B-cells
entering to germinal center reaction suggests a striking
antigen selection [31, 32]. Furthermore, more than two
thirds of KCDR3 sequences were found to be highly
stereotyped and the majority of them even were identical.
Most importantly, almost all the HCDR3, KCDR3, and
LCDR3 sequences exhibited a high homology to reported
antibody sequences specific for HBV-associated antigen,
mainly HBsAg. Lastly, most of these Ig genes were highly
mutated.
In B-cell malignancies, the study of the antigen
receptor variable region genes is a key tool to provide
circumstantial evidence for both a possible involvement
of antigen selection and their ontogenetic derivation.
Different biased Ig gene usages and stereotyped CDR3
sequences suggesting antigen selective and ontogenetic
processes were fully reported in many subtypes of B-cell
malignancies [26, 29, 30, 33–35]. Furthermore, although
the immunogenetic analysis in lymphoma had focused
mainly on Ig heavy chain genes, a series of evidence
support that Ig light chain might also play a substantial
role in the antigen recognition [30, 33, 36, 37]. Consistent
with these literatures, all the distinctive immunogenetic
characteristics in our study strongly supported that
chronic viral antigen stimulation might be an initiating
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

event in the lymphomagenesis in chronic HBV-infected
populations, although other mechanisms such as direct
viral infection of B-cells need to be further investigated.
This would be more plausible when the biologic features
of HBV were taken into account. Chronic HBV infection
is typically characterized by the production of extremely
high quantities of viral proteins, and antibody responses
are vigorous and sustained [38, 39].
The association between HBV and DLBCL
would parallel that between HCV and NHL, where
more extensive evidence regarding clinical features
and pathogenesis mechanisms were available [10].
Till now, chronic viral antigen stimulation is the most
plausible mechanism. The most frequent HCV-associated
lymphoma subtypes originate from either germinal
center or postgerminal center lymphocytes, suggesting
lymphomagenesis occurs when B-cells proliferate in
response to antigen. Further evidence comes from the
observation that the B-cell receptor of HCV-associated
lymphoma has biased usages of VH1-69 and VK3-27A
[40], as well as a homology of both IG heavy and light
chain CDR3 sequence to anti-HCV E2 antibody [10].
However, apparent differences could be demonstrated
between HCV-associated and HBV-associated B-cell
lymphomas. First, HCV is a RNA virus but HBV a DNA
virus, which definitely might result in different natural
history, clinical consequences, and biologic features;
secondly, except aggressive B-cell lymphoma, HCVrelated B-cell lymphoma also include indolent lymphoma
such as MZL and lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma, but
our data showed that HBsAg-positive DLBCL was more
aggressive and most of them had an extremely poor
outcome.
Our study may provide useful information for the
clinical management of both patients with HBV-associated
DLBCL and the 350 million chronic HBV-infected
populations. DLBCL is a highly heterogeneous disease.
Based on their unique clinical features, poor outcome,
and identical etiology, our study suggested that HBVassociated DLBCL might be considered as a unique subset
of DLBCL. The standard R-CHOP therapy was far less
enough for these patients. New therapeutic strategies such
as treatment aiming to the B-cell receptor BCR signaling
might be useful for these patients. Our study suggested
that, unlike hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) mainly
occurs in patients with hepatitis B [16], B-cell lymphoma
developed in patients with diverse manifestations of
chronic HBV infections although mainly in chronic
carriers. A routine screening of not only liver cirrhosis but
also spleen and retroperitoneal masses in chronic HBVinfected population might help for an early diagnosis of
HBV-associated lymphoma.
Our study had some limitations. The association
between occult HBV-infection and B-cell NHL is not
taken into account [12, 39]. In fact, there was a trend in our
data that HBsAg-negative but HBcAb-positive DLBCL
25069

Oncotarget

HBV detection

patients had worse survival compared with patients who
were negative for both HBsAg and HBcAb. This result
might be explained by the truth that HBcAb-positive
populations were more likely to be occult HBV-infected
patients and might develop HBV-associated DLBCL.
Moreover, the KCDR3 sequence from an HBsAg-postive
MCL patient also showed high homology to HBsAb (data
not shown) suggesting other subtypes of B-cell lymphoma
may also be related to HBV infection. These limitations
may lead to an underestimation of the impact of HBVinfection on the development of lymphoma.
In conclusion, in conjunction with biologic and
clinical information, our view of HBV-associated
lymphoma may not only lead to a better understanding
of the association between HBV and lymphoma, but also
potentially pave the way for the development of new
management strategies for both chronic HBV-infected
patients and HBV-associated lymphoma.

Routine screening for viral markers including
HBsAg, hepatitis-B surface antibody (HBsAb), hepatitis-B
e antigen (HBeAg), hepatitis-B e antibody (HBeAb) and
hepatitis-B core antibody (HBcAb) was performed by
chemiluminescence immunoassay on Architect-i2000
(Abbott Laboratories). Real-time quantitative polymerase
chain reaction was used to determine the HBV DNA copy
number before chemotherapy if HBsAg or HBcAb is
positive. All patients were also tested for serum human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis-C virus
(HCV) antibody.

Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification
Total DNA was extracted from formalin-fixed
paraffin-embedded tissue sections from 47 of the 81
HBsAg-positive DLBCL patients using the Omega
DNA extraction kit (Omega, United States). Ig heavy
chain, kappa and lambda chain gene segments from
framework region 3 (FR3) were amplified according to
the BIOMED-2 Concerted Action protocols [41]. For the
samples with no detectable amplification of IGHV-D-J
rearrangements from FR3, PCR was performed from
framework region 2 (FR2). PCR products were sequenced
directly, including both forward and reverse reads,
using Bid-Dye terminators (Applied Biosystems, USA).
All samples were tested in two separate PCR experiments
and sequencing in both directions.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient selection and treatment
A total of 670 patients were consecutively diagnosed
with DLBCL in Peking University Cancer Hospital from
February 2001 to July 2010. The pathological diagnosis
was confirmed according to the World Health Organization
(WHO) Classification of Tumors of Hematopoietic and
Lymphoid Tissues (2008). The staging was determined
according to the Ann Arbor Staging Criteria. Eighty-three
patients were excluded due to incomplete information
and 587 patients were included in the study. All
patients received a standard CHOP (cyclophosphamide,
doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone) regimen or
rituximab plus CHOP (R-CHOP) as the primary treatment.
For 21 patients who have an active HBV infection with an
HBV DNA level greater than 1 * 105 IU/ml, rituximab was
not used. Since June 2008, prophylactic antiviral therapy
was given for 54 HBsAg-positive patients and 90 HBsAgnegative, HBcAb-positive patients up to 6 months after
oncologic treatment ends, irrespectively of HBV-DNA
level. The institutional ethics board approved the study.

Analysis of Ig heavy and light chain
variable region
All obtained sequences were analyzed using the
IMGT/V-QUEST database (http://www.imgt.org, last
accessed August 6, 2014) [42]. We classified the sequences
into truly unmutated, minimally/borderlinely mutated,
and highly mutated groups as previously described [35].
We used previously described stringent criteria to define
a stereotyped heavy and light chain complementarity
determining region 3 (CDR3) amino acid sequence
[36, 43]. Analyses were performed using the ClustalX
2.0 multiple sequence alignment software. The CDR3
sequences were also analyzed by the NCBI Basic Local
Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) program (see http://
blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi?form=0) for homology
to multiple protein sequence databases [43].

Immunohistochemistry and cell of origin
classification
Immunohistochemical analysis was performed for
CD10 (clone 56C6; Novocastra), BCL6 (clone LN22;
Novocastra), and MUM1 (clone MUMp1; DAKO) using
a streptavidin-biotin complex technique and 4-um thick
unstained slides. The cell of origin classification was based
on the Hans algorithm [24]. Cell of origin was identified in
49 of the 81 HBsAg-positive DLBCL patients. To exclude
the impact of occult HBV infection, cell of origin was
also identified in 93 of the 264 DLBCL patients who were
negative for both HBsAg and HBcAb.

Statistical analysis
The groups of patients were compared by the
Pearson’s chi-square test or the Fisher exact test for
categorical parameters, and Mann-Whitney U test for
continuous variables. The differences were considered
significant at p < 0.05. Overall survival (OS) was defined
as the time elapsed from the date of diagnosis of DLBCL
25070

Oncotarget

to the date of death or the last follow-up. Progressionfree survival (PFS) was defined as the time elapsed
between treatment initiation and tumor progression or
death from any cause, with censoring of patients who
are lost to follow-up. Survival curves were calculated by
Kaplan-Meier method and the differences between two
groups were compared by log-rank test. The multivariate
analysis of outcome in terms of OS was performed by Cox
regression, which included all the parameters with p ≤ 0.1
as determined by the univariate analysis. All calculations
were made in SPSS/PC+ version 16.0.
