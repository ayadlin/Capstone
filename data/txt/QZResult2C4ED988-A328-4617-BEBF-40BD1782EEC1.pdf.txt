Abstract
PrLZ/PC-1 is a newly identified, prostate-specific and androgen-inducible gene. Our previous study
showed that PrLZ can enhance the proliferation and invasive capability of LNCaP cells, contributing to the
development of prostate cancer. However, its potential role in androgen-independent processes remains
elusive. In this study, we showed that PrLZ enhanced in vitro growth and colony formation of prostate
cancer cells on androgen deprivation as well as tumorigenicity in castrated nude mice. In addition, PrLZ
stabilized mitochondrial transmembrane potential, prevented release of cytochrome c from mitochondria
to cytoplasm, and inhibited intrinsic apoptosis induced by androgen depletion. Mechanistically, PrLZ
elevated the phosphorylation of Akt and Stat3 and upregulated Bcl-2 expression. Our data indicate that
PrLZ protects prostate cancer cells from apoptosis and promotes tumor progression following androgen
deprivation. In summary, we propose that PrLZ is a novel antiapoptotic gene that is specifically activated
in prostate cancer cells escaping androgen deprivation may offer an appealing therapeutic target to prevent
or treat advanced prostate malignancy. Cancer Res; 71(6); 2193–202. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
Prostate cancer is the most common malignancy and the
second leading cause of cancer death among males in the
United States (1). Growth of prostate cancer in the early stage
is androgen dependent, and tumor cells undergo apoptosis on
androgen depletion, forming the basis for androgen ablation
therapy (2). However, almost all patients will relapse with
hormone-refractory disease due to the outgrowth of androgen-independent cancer cells (2, 3). In this stage, the ratio of
proliferation to apoptosis is unbalanced and cells are more
resistant to apoptosis (4), leading to failure of androgen
ablation therapy and leaving patients with fewer therapeutic
options. Until now, the detailed apoptosis-regulating mechanisms in prostate cancer cells resistant to androgen ablation
therapy are still not clear.

The established LNCaP/C4-2 cell models mimic the clinical progression of prostate cancer (5). LNCaP is androgendependent, nonmetastatic, and weakly tumorigenic, whereas
its lineage-derived subline C4-2, obtained from tumor–stoma
interaction, possesses the capabilities of androgen-independent growth and distant organ metastasis (6). These 2 cell
lines constitute an ideal experimental model system to explore
the genetic and/or epigenetic differences between androgendependent and androgen-independent prostate cancer cells.
PrLZ, also known as PC-1, was first identified from 1,500
arrayed genes using cDNA differential expression microarray
in LNCaP and C4-2 cells (7). Compared with the low expression in LNCaP cells, PrLZ was distinctively upregulated in C4-2
cells. It localizes to human chromosome 8q21.1, one of the
most amplified regions in prostate cancer (8, 9). PrLZ belongs
to the tumor protein D52 (TPD52) family, which is mainly
associated with the proliferation and progression of tumors
(10). Unlike the extensive expression of TPD52 in many tumor
tissues and cell lines, multiple tissue expression assays showed
that PrLZ was predominantly expressed in prostate, with only
minimal expression in the gastrointestinal tract and other
secretory glandular tissues (7). Immunohistochemical stains
revealed that PrLZ was more highly expressed in high-grade
prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) and prostate cancer
than in normal prostate or benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH)
(7). Notably, intense staining of PrLZ was limited to malignant cells, but not neighboring unaffected or normal cells (7),
indicating its direct relationship to carcinogenesis and tumor
progression in prostate cancer.

Our previous research showed that PrLZ expression was
associated with the proliferation and invasion of prostate
cancer cells (11, 12), which is consistent with other reports
(13, 14). To elucidate the potential role and mechanism of
PrLZ in the progression from androgen-dependent to androgen-independent prostate cancer, we established the gain-offunction LNCaP cell model using PrLZ expression vector and
the loss-of-function C4-2 cell model using PrLZ-specific
microRNA (miRNA) vector. Our data suggested that PrLZ
enhanced the in vitro and in vivo growth and tumorigenicity
of prostate cancer cells in response to androgen deprivation.
PrLZ also protected androgen-sensitive prostate cancer cells
from intrinsic apoptosis following the deprivation of androgen
via enhancement of Akt and Stat3 phosphorylation and upregulation of Bcl-2. Taken together, PrLZ seems to be a critical
factor in promoting androgen-independent survival and progression of prostate cancer.

Materials and Methods
Cells and reagents
Human prostate cancer LNCaP and C4-2 cells were previously reported (5) and maintained in RPMI 1640 (GIBCO)
supplemented with 10% (v/v) FBS (Sijiqing) at 37 C with 5%
CO2 in a humidified incubator. To deplete androgen, cells were
cultured in phenol red–free RPMI 1640 with 10% charcoal/
dextran-treated FBS (C/D FBS; Hyclone). Stattic (Stat3 inhibitor V) and LY 294002 (PI3K inhibitor) were purchased from
Calbiochem and Cell Signaling Technology, respectively. Antibodies for Akt, phosphorylated Akt (Ser473), cleaved caspase-9,
caspase-3, and PARP were purchased from Cell Signaling
Technology. Antibodies for Stat3, phosphorylated Stat3
(Tyr705), Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Mcl-1, cytochrome c, and VEGF were
purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology.
Establishment of stable PrLZ-overexpressing, PrLZknockdown cells and transient Stat3 and Bcl-2 siRNA
transfection
Stable PrLZ-overexpressing sublines (i.e., LNCaP/PrLZ) and
empty vector control (i.e., LNCaP/EV) subline were established as previously described (11). PrLZ-specific miRNAexpressing plasmid pcDNA6.2-GW/EmGFP-miPrLZ and
siRNA for Stat3 or Bcl-2 were designed and synthesized by
Invitrogen. Sequence of miRNA or siRNA used in this study
were as follows: miRNA for PrLZ forward 50 -TGC TGT TTG

MTT assay
Cell growth rate was determined by MTT proliferation assay
as in our previous study (15). Briefly, after cells were seeded in
96-well plates in medium containing C/D FBS, MTT (final
concentration 0.5 mg/mL; Sigma) was added, incubated for 4
hours, and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was then added to
solubilize the formazan crystals. The absorbance (OD) was
measured at 590 nm using the Microplate Autoreader (BioTek Instruments). Independent experiments were repeated in
triplicate.
Colony formation assay
A total of 1,000 cells per well of single-cell suspension were
seeded in 6-well plates. After 24 hours, medium was replaced
with fresh medium containing C/D FBS and plates were
incubated at 37 C with 5% CO2 in a humidified incubator
for 14 days; fresh medium was added every 4 days. The plates
were then washed with ice-cold PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, stained in crystal violet solution for 15 minutes at
room temperature, and washed with distilled water until no
color was evident in the rinse. Plates were dried in air and the
colony numbers were counted.
Apoptosis and mitochondrial transmembrane potential
assay
Cells were plated in medium containing C/D FBS for 72
hours and then harvested and washed with PBS. Apoptosis kit
(Invitrogen) containing Annexin V-FITC and propidium
iodide (PI) were used to determine cell apoptosis. Mitochondrial transmembrane potential (DYm) was determined by JC-1
staining. Data were collected by flow cytometric analysis using
FACS Calibur (Becton Dickinson). For each assay, 3 independent experiments were conducted.
Western blot analysis
The whole cell lysate was prepared using RIPA buffer
containing proteinase inhibitors. The cytosol/mitochondria
fractionation was prepared using a mitochondria extraction
kit (Runtai Biotech). An equal amount of lysates (30 mg) was
separated by 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose
membranes. The membranes were initially blocked with 5%
skim milk in TBS for 1 hour at room temperature, followed by
incubation with primary antibodies at 4 C overnight. After
washing with TBST buffer, membranes were incubated with
secondary antibodies coupled with horseradish peroxidase for
1 hour at room temperature, and protein signal was then
detected using the ECL chemiluminescent detection system
(Amersham). Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase
(GAPDH) was used as a loading control.
Xenograft animal model
Six- to 8-week-old nude athymic BALB/c male mice were
used to determine the in vivo tumor take and tumor growth
rate. Cells (5  106) were suspended in 200 mL serum-free
RPMI 1640 containing Matrigel (1:1, v/v; BD Biosciences) and
injected subcutaneously (s.c.) into both flanks of mice using a
27-gauge insulin syringe. Mice bearing tumors were castrated
4 weeks after cell injection. Tumor volumes were measured

weekly for 8 weeks. Then the primary tumors were removed,
fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, embedded in paraffin, sectioned, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). Immunohistochemical staining was carried out as described
previously (16), and results were quantified using software
of Image-Pro 6.3.
Statistical analysis
All data analyses were done by software of SPSS13.0 for
Windows. P < 0.05 was regarded as the threshold value for
statistical significance.

Results
Establishment of PrLZ-overexpressing and -knockdown
prostate cancer cell lines
Stable PrLZ-overexpressing (i.e., LNCaP/PrLZ) cells were
established and reported in our previous studies (11). Three
LNCaP/PrLZ sublines, LNCaP/PrLZ1, LNCaP/PrLZ2, and
LNCaP/PrLZ3, exhibited elevated PrLZ protein expression
(Fig. 1A); 2 of them were randomly chosen for future study.
To establish PrLZ knockdown in C4-2 cells, PrLZ-specific
miRNA-expressing vector or control vector was transfected
into C4-2 cells, followed by selection with Blasticidin (3 mg/
mL) for 4 weeks and then individual Blasticidin-resistant
clones were isolated. Three clones with decreased expression

of PrLZ determined by Western blot were designated as C4-2/
miPrLZ1, C4-2/miPrLZ2, and C4-2/miPrLZ3 (Fig. 1B); 2 of
them were chosen for future study. The empty vector-transfected control cells were designated as C4-2/EV.
PrLZ promotes in vitro and in vivo growth in prostate
cancer cells following androgen depletion
Previously, we showed that PrLZ enhanced the in vitro
growth capability of LNCaP cells (11). In this study, we further
characterized the effect of PrLZ on the in vitro growth of
prostate cancer cells under androgen deprivation conditions
(i.e., medium containing C/D FBS). As shown in Figure 2A,
LNCaP/PrLZ cells exhibited an accelerated growth profile
compared with parental LNCaP or control LNCaP/EV cells,
which displayed no significant growth over 6 days of androgen
depletion. In contrast, both C4-2 and C4-2/EV cells were able
to grow under androgen deprivation conditions, whereas
PrLZ-knockdown C4-2/miPrLZ cells displayed dramatically
decreased growth rates (Fig. 2B).
Next, we determined the colony formation capacity of
prostate cancer cells with or without exogenous PrLZ expression under androgen deprivation condition. We found that the
parental androgen-dependent LNCaP and control LNCaP/EV
cells formed a similar number of colonies, which was significantly lower than that formed by the LNCaP/PrLZ cells (P
< 0.05; Fig. 2C). On the contrary, both C4-2 and C4-2/EV cells
formed significantly more colonies than C4-2/miPrLZ cells
under androgen deprivation condition (P < 0.05; Fig. 2D).
In addition, we also determined in vivo tumor growth and
tumor take of these cells in nude mice. Similar to our previous
work (11), data from s.c. model indicated that ectopic PrLZ
expression facilitated tumor take rate and accelerated tumor
growth in LNCaP/PrLZ cells; detectable tumors were observed
within as few as 10 days after injection. In contrast, parental
LNCaP cells could not form tumors until at least 3 weeks after
injection. In addition, the growth rate of parental LNCaP cells
was much slower than LNCaP/PrLZ cells (P < 0.001; Fig. 3A
and B). Similar results were observed in PrLZ-positive C4-2
cells, however, C4-2/miPrLZ cells did not form any detectable
tumors. As we expected, when all the mice were castrated
4 weeks after cell injection, the parental LNCaP tumor displayed growth retardation whereas LNCaP/PrLZ and C4-2
tumors maintained a rapid growth rate in the xenograft mice
model (Fig. 3A and B). Histologic analysis indicated that
tumors derived from LNCaP/PrLZ cells exhibited more blood
vessels compared with parental LNCaP cells (Fig. 3C).
PrLZ protects prostate cancer cells from apoptosis in
response to androgen deprivation
Androgen deprivation can cause apoptosis in both normal
and malignant prostate cells (17). To investigate the role of
PrLZ in apoptosis, cells were exposed to medium containing
C/D FBS for 72 hours then the degree of apoptosis was
determined. Our results showed that the percentage of apoptotic cells was significantly lower in LNCaP/PrLZ and C4-2
cells compared with parental LNCaP and C4-2/miPrLZ cells
(P < 0.01; Fig. 4A, top). These data indicated that PrLZ is
able to inhibit cell apoptosis under androgen deprivation

condition. As the loss of mitochondrial transmembrane
potential (DYm) plays an important role in triggering apoptotic pathways, we measured the effect of PrLZ on DYm.
Following androgen deprivation for 72 hours, consistent with
the apoptosis data (Fig. 4A), a significant loss of DYm was
observed in LNCaP and C4-2/miPrLZ cells compared with
PrLZ-overexpressing LNCaP/PrLZ and parental C4-2 cells,

control C4-2/EV cells, suggesting that PrLZ probably antagonizes the intrinsic apoptosis.
PrLZ elicits the phosphorylation of Akt and Stat3
and upregulates the expression of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Mcl-1,
and VEGF
Both Akt and Stat3 have been demonstrated to play a
critical role in the malignancy, castration-resistance, and
metastases of prostate cancer (18–20). Therefore, we further
determined the effect of PrLZ on their expression and activation/phosphorylation under androgen deprivation conditions.
As shown in Figure 5A, PrLZ elicited the phosphorylation of
Akt (Ser473) and Stat3 (Tyr705) in LNCaP/PrLZ cells whereas
C4-2/miPrLZ cells displayed a decreased level compared with
parental C4-2 cells. In addition, Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Mcl-1,
downstream targets of Stat3 and potent antiapoptotic proteins, were also examined. As expected, their levels were
increased in LNCaP/PrLZ and C4-2 cells relative to those in
LNCaP and C4-2/miPrLZ cells respectively (Fig. 5A).
In addition, immunohistochemistry was applied to determine the expression pattern of Stat3 and Bcl-2 in tumor
specimens from nude mice. The results showed that the
nuclear expression of Stat3 (activated Stat3) and Bcl-2 expression were significantly elevated in LNCaP/PrLZ and C4-2
tumors, whereas tumors derived from parental LNCaP cells
exhibited cytoplasmic expression of Stat3 (inactivated Stat3)
and low staining of Bcl-2 (Fig. 5B). Furthermore, VEGF, a
hallmark of angiogenesis, also elevated in tumors derived from
LNCaP/PrLZ and C4-2 cells (Fig. 5B). In addition, quantified
analysis showed that parental LNCaP cells exhibited lower
expression of nuclear Stat3, Bcl-2, and VEGF compared with
LNCaP/PrLZ and C4-2 cells (Fig. 5C).
Inactivation of Akt inhibits Stat3 phosphorylation in
LNCaP/PrLZ and C4-2 cells
Previous findings indicated that cross-talk existed between
JAK/Stat and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways (21–23). In this
study, cells were treated with LY 294002 (an inhibitor of PI3K)
or Stattic (a Stat3 specific inhibitor). As shown in Figure 6A,
both inhibitors abolished Akt or Stat3 phosphorylation respectively. Notably, LY 294002 treatment not only reduced Akt
activation but also decreased Stat3 phosphorylation. However,
when cells were exposed to Stattic, no changes in Akt phosphorylation were observed. These data indicate that Akt is an
upstream regulator for Stat3.
Stat3/Bcl-2 signaling pathway mediated the
antiapoptotic function of PrLZ
To further investigate the significance of Stat3 signaling in
the antiapoptotic function of PrLZ following androgen deprivation in prostate cancer cells, we targeted Stat3 with either
siRNA or Stattic. Notably, knockdown or inhibition of Stat3 led
to apoptosis as well as loss of DYm in PrLZ-overexpressing
LNCaP/PrLZ cells and C4-2 cells with high endogenous PrLZ
expression following androgen withdrawal (Fig. 6B). In addition, Bcl-2 protein was also inhibited by knocking down Stat3
(Fig. 6C). Furthermore, when knocking down Bcl-2 in LNCaP/
PrLZ and C4-2 cells, both increased apoptosis and loss of DYm

2198

Cancer Res; 71(6) March 15, 2011

were observed regardless of the presence of PrLZ and Stat3
phosphorylation (Fig. 6B). These alterations were concomitant
with elevation of cleaved caspase-9, caspase-3, and PARP
detected by Western blot (Fig. 6C).

Discussion
PrLZ is a newly identified, prostate-specific, and androgeninducible gene (7). Because it is upregulated in androgenresistant C4-2 cells and overexpressed in human prostate
cancer, we hypothesized that PrLZ may play a role in the
outgrowth of androgen-independent prostate cancer. To test
this hypothesis, we determined the effect of PrLZ on the
growth capability of prostate cancer cells under androgen
deprivation in both androgen-sensitive LNCaP cells and
androgen-independent C4-2 cells. Several lines of evidence
from our study showed that PrLZ is critical for the outgrowth of androgen-independent prostate cancer cells. First,
PrLZ overexpression promoted the growth of LNCaP cells in
the absence of androgen, whereas PrLZ-knockdown cells
exhibited a dramatically reduced growth in C4-2 cells. Second, the colony formation assay demonstrated that cell
transformation capability was enhanced with PrLZ overexpression in LNCaP/PrLZ cells but reduced in C4-2/miPrLZ
cells. Third, consistent results were obtained from a xenograft animal model. Compared with parental LNCaP cells,
LNCaP/PrLZ cells exhibited higher tumor take rate and
accelerated tumor growth under androgen deprivation condition. Similarly, C4-2/miPrLZ cells failed to form any
tumors compared with C4-2 cells. These in vitro and in vivo
experiments clearly indicate that PrLZ is sufficient to drive
androgen-independent growth in prostate cancer cells and is
indispensable for the survival of androgen-independent C4-2
cells. Our data also suggest that PrLZ may play a critical role
in regulating prostate cancer progression during androgendependent to androgen-independent conversion.
Accumulating data have shown that either JAK/Stat or
PI3K/Akt signaling pathway are critical for cancer cell survival
and metastasis (18–20, 24, 25). On Stat activation, Stat proteins
are phosphorylated to form either homodimers or heterodimers, and then translocated into nucleus where they can bind
to their target gene promoter sequences and activate transcription (26). Stat3, one of the key members of this family, has
been shown to play a crucial role in prosurvival activities of
prostate cancer cells (27, 28). In addition, a recent study
indicates that PrLZ overexpression can enhance Akt phosphorylation underlying the progression of prostate cancer
(14). In this study, we show that PrLZ could increase Stat3
phosphorylation mediated by activation of Akt, which is
further demonstrated by rescue experiments showing that
inhibition of PI3K by specific inhibitor could abolish both Akt
and Stat3 phosphorylation in PrLZ-expressing cells, whereas
inhibition of Stat3 activation could not change Akt phosphorylation. Based on these data, we conclude that Akt is an
upstream regulator for Stat3 in PrLZ mediated antiapoptotic
effects. In addition, it has been reported that interleukin-6 (IL6) or epidermal growth factor (EGF) increases Stat3 phosphorylation and regulates LNCaP cells growth (29–33). We

examined whether elevated IL-6 or EGF can be detected in
PrLZ-expressing cells. However, we failed to show that PrLZmediated Stat3 activation goes through IL-6 or EGF regulation
loop in these cells (Supplementary Fig. S1).
It is known that Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Mcl-1, and VEGF are all the
downstream target genes of Stat3 (29, 34). Both Bcl-2 and
Bcl-xL localize on the outer mitochondrial membrane (35) and
are able to stabilize the mitochondrial membrane potential,
maintain mitochondrial permeability, and prevent the release
of cytochrome c from mitochondrial to cytoplasm on repressed apoptosis (36, 37). In PrLZ-overexpressed prostate
cancer cells, we have observed a stabilization of mitochondrial
transmembrane potential along with the induction of Bcl-2,
Bcl-xL, and Mcl-1 in the condition of androgen deletion. In
contrast, both loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential

2200

Cancer Res; 71(6) March 15, 2011

and decreased expression of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Mcl-1 were
observed in PrLZ knocked down prostate cancer cells in the
condition of androgen deletion. In addition, when Stat3 was
knocked down using siRNA or inactivated by inhibitor, Bcl-2
was downregulated accordingly. Also, increased apoptosis
and loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential were
observed. Taken together, these data provide supporting
evidence that PrLZ play the survival roles in prostate cancer
cells on androgen-independent progression (38, 39).
In summary, our data showed that overexpression of PrLZ
could protect prostate cancer cells from apoptosis induced
by androgen deprivation, which is mediated by the activation
of Stat3/Bcl-2 signaling pathway. Thus, PrLZ is a potential
factor in the outgrowth of androgen-independent prostate
cancer. Considering its prostate specificity and upregulation
