PPP induces G2-M arrest (5). This effect is not dependent
on IGF-IR: PPP (0.5 Amol/L, 12 h) induced G2-M arrest in IGF1R–deficient cells (43.5% in G2-M; 24.8% in untreated cells).
R. S. Gupta reexamined PPT/PPP effects on HepG2 cells, which were
reported resistant to >15 Amol/L PPT/PPP (1). HepG2 cells were sensitive
to PPT and PPP; the IC90 was 30 nmol/L for PPT and 0.5 Amol/L for PPP.
PPT treatment of cancer is limited by severe side effects. Although
IGF-IR is an attractive cancer therapy target, our data showing that
PPTand PPP induce loss of viability and cell death in IGF-IR–deficient
cells contest their potential as IGF-IR–specific anticancer drugs.

Picropodophyllotoxin or
Podophyllotoxin Does Not Induce
Cell Death via Insulin-like Growth
Factor-I Receptor
To the Editor:
The cyclolignan picropodophyllotoxin (PPP) was recently
launched as an anticancer drug specifically targeting insulin-like
growth factor-I receptor (IGF-IR; ref. 1). PPP is an epimer of
podophyllotoxin (PPT), an established inhibitor of microtubule
assembly used to treat genital warts. PPT binds to the colchicine
binding site of tubulin (2). PPT-resistant cells are cross-resistant to
colchicine, colcemid, and vinblastine (3). PPP is 20- to 50-fold less
potent than PPT in inhibition of microtubule assembly (4) and
the GI50 of PPP is 50-fold that of PPT (500 versus 10 nmol/L).
This would be expected if growth inhibition by PPP is due to
microtubule inhibition (discussed in ref. 3). Also consistent with
this notion is that PPT-resistant cells are resistant to PPP (3).
Despite the documented microtubule effects, an association
between IGF-IR expression and sensitivity to PPT/PPP was reported
(1). Eleven cell types expressing IGF-IR were found sensitive to PPP,
and three cell types lacking IGF-IR expression were resistant in vitro
and/or in vivo (1). The in vitro GI50 for cell types lacking IGF-IR
expression (R cells, HepG2 cells) was >15 Amol/L for both drugs (1).
S. Linder and M. C. Shoshan reexamined PPT/PPP effects on IGFIR–deficient R cells, which were reported resistant to 15 Amol/L
PPT/PPP (1). R cells ( from Dr. Renato Baserga, Kimmel Cancer
Center, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA) and mouse
embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) were exposed to 0.5 Amol/L PPT or PPP
( from Dr. Girnita, Department of Oncology-Pathology, Karolinska
Institute, Stockholm, Sweden), a concentration used to inhibit IGF-IR
(5). Both cell types were equally sensitive; PPP reduced viability of
R1 cells to 52.6 F 7.5% of control and of MEFs to 58.3 F 6.4% of
control, whereas PPT reduced viability to 51.8 F 2.2% and 58.3 F 6.4%
of control, respectively [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay; 40 h]. Four independent experiments yielded
similar results. Both drugs induced sub-G1 debris in R cells, indicative of cell death (PPT, 64% of total counts; PPP, 56%; controls, 6%).
