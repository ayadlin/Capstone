BACKGROUND: Despite prophylactic platelet transfusions, bleeding remains a significant problem in thrombocytopenic patients.
METHODS: The antifibrinolytic agent epsilon aminocaproic acid (EACA) was administered to 44 chronically (median duration, 273
days) and severely (platelet count, 8 3 109/L; range, 1 3 109/L- 19 3 109/L) thrombocytopenic patients with hematological malignancies. Prophylactic EACA at a dose of 1 g twice daily was orally administered for a median duration of 47 days (range, 7 days-209
days) until the platelet count recovered to > 30; 3 109/L. Platelets were only transfused if bleeding occurred. RESULTS: While
receiving EACA, 59% of the patients did not bleed, 25% had 19 episodes of spontaneously resolving minor bleeding that did not
require platelet transfusion, and 16% received a median of 4 platelet transfusions (range, 1 transfusion-8 transfusions) for 1 major
traumatic and 9 spontaneous grade 2 to grade 3 bleeding (based on the World Health Organization classification of idiopathic
thrombocytopenic purpura). No EACA toxicities were noted, and venous thromboses were not observed. CONCLUSIONS: EACA is
well tolerated and is associated with a low risk of major bleeding in patients with hematological malignancies who are experiencing

INTRODUCTION
Thrombocytopenia is frequently chronic, severe, and refractory to platelet transfusion in patients with bone marrow failure syndromes and hematological malignancies.1 Despite prophylactic allogeneic platelet transfusion, maintaining platelet
counts within a safe range is often difficult in this patient population, and bleeding complications occur in approximately
20% of patients with acute myeloid leukemia and in up to 58% of hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients.2-5 Epsilon aminocaproic acid (EACA) is an orally bioavailable and well-tolerated antifibrinolytic agent that reduces mucosal
bleeding associated with fibrinolysis, platelet dysfunction, Von Willebrand disease, and hemophilia.6,7 EACA was also
associated with a reduction of bleeding in thrombocytopenic hemorrhage in patients with cancer and hematological disorders.8,9 In the current study, we administered EACA as a substitute for prophylactic platelet transfusion in 44 transfusiondependent, severely thrombocytopenic patients with hematological malignancies and nonmalignant disorders and report
our experience.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients with chronic, transfusion-dependent thrombocytopenia who received prophylactic EACA in the outpatient setting between January 2005 and December 2011 were identified through a computerized database search. After the initiation of EACA, prophylactic threshold-driven platelet transfusion was discontinued and patients received only therapeutic
platelet transfusion in case of bleeding, except when a patient was admitted to the inpatient unit. In the inpatient unit, prophylactic platelets were routinely infused when the platelet count was < 10 3 109/L. The number of platelets transfused
in the hospital in the absence of bleeding was censored. Patient demographics, diagnosis, treatment, platelet counts, duration of thrombocytopenia, transfusion history, bleeding, and outcomes were captured onto study-specific case report

forms. Bleeding was captured regardless of the patient’s
location (outpatient or hospital unit) and retrospectively
scored based on the World Health Organization classification of idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura: grade 1
indicated petechial bleeding; grade 2 indicated clinically
mild blood loss; grade 3 indicated macroscopic blood loss
requiring transfusion; and grade 4 indicated retinal, cerebral, or debilitating blood loss. Statistics were descriptive.
This retrospective analysis was approved by the Emory
University Institutional Review Board.
RESULTS
Characteristics of the 44 patients who received EACA are
summarized in Table 1. Approximately 96% of the
patients had a hematological malignancy and 2 had a nonmalignant hematological disorder (chronic immune
thrombocytopenia and aplastic anemia, respectively). The
median age of the patients was 61 years (range, 17 years82 years). The median platelet count at the time of initiation of EACA was 8 3 109/L (range, 1 3 109/L-19 3
109/L). Before the initiation of EACA, the median duration of thrombocytopenia was 273 days (range, 20 days1463 days) and patients were transfused 2 to 3 times a
week in either the outpatient setting at the study institution or at the referring physician’s office, when the platelet
count was < 20 3 109/L. The median number of outpatient single-donor platelet units transfused at the study
institution for these 44 patients was 78 (range, 7 units418 units). Thirty patients (68%) had a median of 4 hospitalizations (range, 1 hospitalization-12 hospitalizations)
of a median duration of 12 days (range, 4 days-23 days)
during the course of treatment with EACA mainly for
chemotherapy, but also for the management of neutropenic fever. Approximately 71% had recurrent/refractory
disease, whereas 29% of patients had a stable disease or
were actively receiving chemotherapy at the time EACA
was administered. Ten patients (23%) were refractory to
platelet transfusions and had platelet counts continuously < 10 3 109/L.
EACA was prescribed at an oral dose of 1 g twice
daily until the sustained, untransfused platelet count
was > 30 3 109/L. EACA was not administered to reduce
bleeding in these thrombocytopenic patients, but rather
was given as an alternative to prophylactic platelet transfusions that were previously administered 2 to 3 times per
week. The median duration of the administration of
EACA was 47 days (range, 7 days-209 days). Patients
were monitored in the outpatient clinic, with a complete
blood count obtained at least once a week. While receiving EACA, 7 of the 44 patients (16%) received a median

secondary to a motor vehicle accident (grade 4) and 1
patient suffering an episode of grade 3 hematochezia from
a preexisting rectal ulcer. The other 5 patients experienced
8 mucocutaneous bleeding episodes of grade 2 (hemorrhoid, epistaxis, oral, bladder, and vaginal). Eleven
patients (25%) experienced 19 episodes of minor mucocutaneous bleeding (epistaxis, bruises, oral, and vaginal)
that resolved spontaneously and did not require platelet
transfusions. The median bleeding score for these 19
events was 1 (range, 1-2). It is interesting to note that only
4 of the 10 platelet-refractory patients experienced bleeding episodes that were mucocutaneous (3 episodes of
grade 1, 5 episodes of grade 2, and 1 episode of grade 3
bleeding).
EACA was generally well tolerated and no patients
discontinued treatment because of intolerance. One
patient discontinued EACA due to the onset of hematuria
(2%), 18 (41%) due to platelet recovery, and 25 (57%)
discontinued EACA due to referral to hospice or death.
No patient experienced a venous thromboembolic event
or other unexpected events attributable to EACA. No
patient died of a bleeding event while receiving EACA.
DISCUSSION
In the absence of an intervention that increases platelet
production or accelerates platelet recovery, recurrent
platelet transfusions remain the only option for patients
with severe chronic thrombocytopenia associated with
hematological malignancies. This approach necessitates
frequent visits to the medical center, is hampered by platelet shortages, and ultimately often leads to alloimmunization and platelet refractoriness.10 In addition, this
approach is ineffective in preventing significant bleeding
episodes in 20% to 50% of patients.3 Based on the mechanism of action of EACA and the effectiveness of this agent
in preventing hemorrhages in patients with congenital
bleeding disorders,7 EACA was administered to patients
with transfusion-dependent chronic and refractory severe
thrombocytopenia. Patients were managed in the outpatient setting despite their severe thrombocytopenia and
received EACA as a substitute for prophylactic, thresholddirected platelet transfusion. In our experience, patients
reported the rapid disappearance of petechiae and resolution of subcutaneous bleeding shortly after the initiation
of EACA. With a median duration of EACA administration of 47 days, but ranging up to 209 days, no major
spontaneous bleeding episodes were observed in these
patients, whose median platelet counts were 8 3 109/L
and for whom no prophylactic platelet transfusions were
administered. Two grade 3 to grade 4 bleeding episodes
3786

occurred in the setting of a trauma and from a preexisting
condition, respectively. Only 16% of the patients received
platelet transfusions (median of 4 units) for all but one
minor spontaneous bleeding episodes.
The dose of EACA selected for chronic administration (1 g administered twice daily) was based on the dosing schedule commonly used in patients with bleeding
disorders, and differs from the package insert that
provides dose recommendations for the treatment of acute
bleeding episodes. To our knowledge, there are no recommended doses for the chronic administration of EACA.
All patients tolerated this empiric dose of EACA and no
cases of venous thrombosis were observed.
To the best of our knowledge, the current study is
the first to report on the use of an antifibrinolytic for the
prevention of thrombocytopenic bleeding. It is possible
that patients with stable chronic thrombocytopenia previously managed with platelet transfusion in the outpatient
setting may very well represent a selected group of individuals who benefit from prophylaxis with EACA. However,
a better understanding of these and other selection biases
and the effects of EACA on quality of life are addressed in
a currently ongoing randomized phase 2 trial comparing
prophylactic EACA with platelet transfusions.
We conclude that EACA is well tolerated and is associated with a low risk of major spontaneous bleeding in
patients with hematological disorders who are experiencing severe and refractory thrombocytopenia and not
receiving prophylactic platelet transfusion. If this
approach is not inferior to platelet transfusion, then the
use of antifibrinolytic agents may open the door for the
use of newer prophylactic strategies in this patient
population.
