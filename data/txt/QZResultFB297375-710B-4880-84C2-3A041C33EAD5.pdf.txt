Abstract:

Malignant gliomas are the prototype of highly infiltrative tumors and this
characteristic is the main factor for the inevitable tumor recurrence and short
survival after most aggressive therapies. The aberrant communication between
glioma cells and tumor microenvironment represents one of the major factors
regulating brain tumor dispersal. Our group has previously reported that the
tyrosine kinase receptor Tie2/TEK is expressed in glioma cells and brain tumor
stem cells and is associated with the malignant progression of these tumors. In
this study, we sought to determine whether the angiopoietin 1 (Ang1)/Tie2 axis
regulates crosstalk between glioma cells and endothelial cells. We found that Ang1
enhanced the adhesion of Tie2-expressing glioma and brain tumor stem cells to
endothelial cells. Conversely, specific small interfering RNA (siRNA) knockdown of
Tie2 expression inhibited the adhesion capability of glioma cells. Tie2 activation
induced integrin β1 and N-cadherin upregulation, and neutralizing antibodies
against these molecules inhibited the adhesion of Tie2-positive glioma cells to
endothelial cells. In 2D and 3D cultures, we observed that Ang1/Tie2 axis activation
was related to increased glioma cell invasion, which was inhibited by using Tie2
siRNA. Importantly, intracranial co-implantation of Tie2-positive glioma cells and
endothelial cells in a mouse model resulted in diffusely invasive tumors with cell
clusters surrounding glomeruloid vessels mimicking a tumoral niche distribution.
Collectively, our results provide new information about the Tie2 signaling in glioma
cells that regulates the cross-talk between glioma cells and tumor microenvironment,
envisioning Tie2 as a multi-compartmental target for glioma therapy.

INTRODUCTION

gliomas are the most common type of primary brain tumor,
and the prognosis for patients with these tumors remains
dismal [2]. Diffuse, infiltrative invasion of glioma cells
into surrounding brain tissue results in tumor recurrence
and contributes to the poor prognosis of patients with
malignant gliomas [3]. Understanding the molecular
mechanisms that underlie tumor glioma progression

Tumor microenvironment plays an important role
in tumor progression and invasion. Interaction of tumor
cells with the extracellular matrix and stromal cells is
crucial for tumor formation including survival, invasion
and maintenance of tumor-initiating cells [1]. Malignant

and local invasion of gliomas represents one of the great
challenges in exploratory cancer research.
The tyrosine kinase receptor Tie2/TEK was initially
reported as a specific vascular receptor present in both
normal and tumoral endothelial cells (EC), including
ECs in astrocytomas, and its levels correlate positively
with increasing malignancy [4-8]. In these processes,
Tie2 and its ligands, angiopoietins, are critical to
angiogenic remodeling [9]. In addition, Tie2 was found
in hematopoietic stem cells and its function was reported
as required for postnatal bone marrow hematopoiesis and
protecting the hematopoietic stem cell compartment from
myelosuppressive stress [10,11]. We previously showed
that Tie2 is expressed in glioma cells and brain tumor
stem cells present in malignant gliomas [12,13]. In the

To characterize the role of Tie2 activation in glioma
cell–EC interaction, we used a co-culture system in which
the adhesion of fluorescent dye–labeled glioma cells to
an EC monolayer was quantified by flow cytometry. We
found that the adhesion of U251.Tie2 cells to ECs was
more than two-fold higher than the adhesion of U251.

adhesion properties of endogenous Tie2-expressing cells,
U-87 MG glioma cells and GSC20 BTSCs [13]. Ang1
significantly stimulated adhesion of both Tie2-expressing
glioma cells and BTSCs to ECs (Figures 1B and C). Of
importance, similar experiment performed in the presence
of Ang2, a context-dependent Tie2 ligand, did not modify
the adhesive properties of glioma cells to ECs (Figure 1B).
We tested the specificity of action of Ang1 on Tie2
receptor by performing two different experiments. First,
treating Tie2-negative U-373 MG cells [13] with Ang1
did not modify their adhesion to ECs (Figure 1D). Second,

These results indicate that the Ang1/Tie2 axis plays a

before and during their co-culture with ECs. We found that
the adhesion of U251.Tie2 cells to ECs in the presence
of neutralizing antibodies against N-cadherin completely
abolished the Tie2-mediated adhesion to ECs (Figure 2C).
To determine whether the upregulation of integrin ß1 is
involved in Tie2-mediated glioma cell-to-EC adhesion,
we performed adhesion experiments in the presence of
an integrin ß1–neutralizing antibody. We observed a
significant decrease in the adhesion of U251.Tie2 glioma
cells to ECs. Suggesting specificity of these results, a
neutralizing antibody for VEGF, a molecule involved in
cell-to-cell interaction [14], did not modify the adhesive
properties of Tie2-expressing glioma cells (Figure 2D).
These data suggested that both N-cadherin and integrin ß1
play major roles in the Tie2-mediated adhesion of glioma
cells to ECs.

on the cell surface, we then used flow cytometry to analyze
the cell-surface expression of N-cadherin. U251.Tie2
cells expressed significantly higher levels of N-cadherin
than U251.vector cells (Figure 2B). Similarly, U-87 MG
cells expressed higher levels of surface N-cadherin after
Ang1 treatment (Figure 2B), as confirmed by Western blot
analysis (Supplementary Figure 1). However, treating
U-87 cells with Ang2 did not significantly modify the
expression of cell-surface N-cadherin (Figure 2B). We
used quantitative RT-PCR to compare the mRNA levels of
N-cadherin, E-cadherin, α-catenin, and β-catenin in U251.

treatment with Ang1 or vehicle. We did not observe any
significant modification in the mRNA levels of N-cadherin,
α-catenin, or β-catenin (E-cadherin expression was not
detectable) in relation to Tie2 activation, suggesting
a post-transcriptional regulation of these molecules
(Supplementary Figure 2).
To determine whether N-cadherin is involved in
Tie2-mediated glioma cell adhesion, we incubated U251.

To further clarify the role of Tie2 in the invasive
phenotype, we used specific siRNA to knock down Tie2
expression. Tie2 downmodulation resulted in the partial
rescue of the invasive phenotype in both Ang1-treated
U-87 MG cells (Figure 3D) and U251.Tie2 cells (Figure
3E). Moreover, neutralizing antibodies against integrin β1
inhibited the Tie2-mediated invasion of both glioma cell
lines. These data suggest that the Ang1/Tie2/integrin β1
axis contributes to glioma cell invasion in vitro.
To better mimic the in situ tumor confining and allow
the contact with 3D matrix, we generated 3D cultures of
U251.vector and U251.Tie2 cells in an enriched collagen
I matrix since collagen I is one of the major components
of the extracellular matrix of gliomas and the activation
of Tie2 resulted in increased adhesion to this extracellular
component [12]. We observed that the 3D U251.Tie2
spheroids acquired an invasive phenotype consisting
on a single-cell migration pattern from the periphery of
the spheroids. This characteristic pattern was observed

Because our data suggest that Tie2 activation
increased cell adhesion properties and N-cadherin and
integrin ß1 expression, and alterations in these two
molecules have been implicated in the invasive phenotype
of malignant gliomas [15,16], we next sought to determine
whether Tie2 activation modulates glioma cell invasion.
Invasion assay revealed that the number of U251.Tie2 cells
that migrated through the Matrigel was more than 3-fold
the number of U251.vector cells that migrated through
the Matrigel (Figure 3A). Similarly, cells expressing
endogenous Tie2 showed a higher degree of invasion
when treated with Ang1. Thus, Ang1-treated U-87 MG
cells invaded the basement membrane about three-fold
more than vehicle-treated U-87 MG cells. These results
were confirmed by studying the role of Tie2-positive
BTSCs, GSC20, in invasion. Thus, the number of GSC20
cells migrated was two-fold higher when the cultures were
exposed to Ang1 than to the vehicle. Together these data
suggested a role of Ang1/Tie2 in invasion of glioma cells.

was maintained by 11 days, the last time point examined.
However, cells from 3D U251.vector spheroids did not
displayed significant migration through the matrix (Figure
4A). Confirmatory experiments were performed using
U-87 MG-derived spheroids. U-87 MG cells were preincubated with Ang1 and then spheroids were cultured in a
collagen I-enriched matrix containing Ang1. We observed
an accelerated rate of migration of Ang1-stimulated U-87
MG cells through the matrix. This response was partially

abrogated by knocking-down Tie2 expression (Figures
4B and C). These results corroborated an essential role of
Tie2 in brain tumor dispersal in vitro.

systems [19, 26]. These cellular interactions should occur
following a temporal and spatial regulation of cell-to-cell
and cell-to-substrate adhesion properties. The fact that
Tie2 activation results in cell-to-cell, as well as cell-tosubstrate adhesion, strongly suggests that Tie2 signaling
is one of the key interactors in the tight and coordinated
regulation of these two processes.
Implications of the existence of BTSCs [17, 27]
include that these cells are associated with the vasculature
in brain tumors constituting the so-called perivascular
niche [28]. A corollary of this tenet is the hypothesis that
interaction of BTSCs with ECs mediates chemoresistance
of cancer cells. Although the interaction of BTSCs with
ECs has been implicated in maintaining the self-renewing
and undifferentiated state of BTSCs [28], little is known
about the mechanism of this critical crosstalk. In the
current study, we found that Ang1 significantly enhanced
the adhesion of Tie2-positive BTSCs to ECs. These
results together with our earlier findings regarding the
contribution of Tie2 signaling to the chemoresistance of
BTSCs [13, 29] might indicate that Tie2 interacts with
BTSCs and contributes to the perivascular, chemoresistant
niche. Further studies should ascertain to which extent
the roles of Tie2 in mediating BTSC adhesion to ECs
and increasing chemoresistance are independent or
interdependent signaling pathways.
Preventing gliomas from developing an invasive
phenotype is one of the main challenges involved in
blocking glioma recurrence and improving outcome.
In the current study, we observed that injecting Tie2positive glioma cells together with ECs resulted in the
formation of more tumors that, in turn, tended to be more
aggressive than Tie2-negative tumors. Thus, although the
role of the tumor microenvironment in modulating the
neoplastic phenotype has been previously reported [28],
the molecular mechanisms regulating this relationship
are still under investigation. The work presented here
demonstrates the key role of Tie2 in the influence of the
tumor/microenvironment cross-talking on the malignant
phenotype of gliomas.
In the fullness of time, our data may have important
overtones for the therapy of malignant gliomas. Placing
Tie2 as a landscape regulator and therefore, as one
of the main interactor in the complexity of the tumor
microenvironment regulation, suggests that therapeutic
targeting of Tie2 would be a potent anti-multicompartment
approach.

Tie2 cells into the brains of immunodeficient mice, and
then we sacrificed the animals approximately 20 days
after cell implantation, and analyzed their brains for the
presence of tumors. Although we observed an increase of
tumor formation with co-injection of U251.vector cells
with ECs (33%), this number was significantly higher
when we co-injected the mice with U251.Tie2 cells and
ECs: 11 of 14 (79%) animals developed intracranial tumors
(Figure 5A). Intriguingly, U251.Tie2 and EC–derived
tumors had different features than U251.vector and EC–
derived tumors (Figure 5B). Thus, glioma cells migrated
farther from the site of injection, resulting in multifocal
tumors that surrounded vascular structures. Furthermore,
and as a novel finding, this pro-tumorigenic force is
enhanced and modulated towards an invasive phenotype
in the presence of neoplastic glial cells expressing
Tie2. To further characterize the glioma Tie2+ cells, we
analyzed a BTSC-derived intracranial xenografts. In this
animal model, Tie2 positive cells co-stained positive for
Nestin expression (30% ± 8% of Nestin+ cells) suggesting
a precursor origin (Figure 5C) [17]. Together our data
suggest that Tie2 plays a non-previously described key
role in the crosstalk between the neoplastic glial cells and
the vascular compartment that, ultimately, modulates the
invasive properties of those tumors.

DISCUSSION
In this report we provide new information on the
role of Tie2 in glioma and brain tumor stem cells. Our
data showed that Tie2 activity in glioma cells and BTSCs
was related to enhanced adhesion to the endothelial
compartment with subsequent increase of their invasion
capability. We also found that injecting Tie2-positive cells
together with ECs into the brains of immunocompromised
animals resulted in the development of invasive, multifocal
tumors that surrounded vascular structures. These data are
relevant because the invasive phenotype of GBMs is one
of the main underlying cause of their refractoriness to
conventional treatment and responsible for the invariable
recurrence after therapy [18].
Our study is continuation of our previous work
on the Tie2-mediated regulation of integrin β1 and the
adhesion to several components of the extracellular
matrix [12]. Integrin-mediated cell substratum adhesion
and migration often occur simultaneously with cadherinbased cell-to-cell adhesion [19-22]. In gliomas, integrin 1
has been reported to be involved in adhesion, migration,
and invasion [23, 24]. Moreover, N-cadherin expression
levels have been reported to be related to the progression
of the malignant phenotype [25]. Here we found that
Tie2 activity upregulates N-cadherin in the membrane
of glioma cells that function to effectively mediate the
cellular interactions with the tumor microenvironment.
Several lines of evidence support an orchestrated
regulation between cadherin- and integrin-mediated

Matrigel Invasion Assay
For invasion assay, we coated transwells (ThinCert
TC Inserts, 8.0-µm pore size; USA Scientific) in 24-well
plates with 0.3 mg/ml Matrigel (BD Biosciences) and
allowed them to adjust to room temperature for 2 hours.
Glioma cells (1 x 105) were washed with serum-free
medium, suspended in 250 µl serum-free medium, and
seeded onto the Matrigel-coated transwells. 600 µl DMEM/
F12 supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum was added
to the lower chambers. When indicated, cells were preincubated with a neutralizing antibody against integrin ß1
(clone 6S6; 10 µg/ml; Chemicon International), or IgG1
as isotype control (R&D System) for 20 minutes at 37ºC.
Cells were then plated in the transwells in the presence of
anti-integrin ß1 antibody. After incubating overnight, cells
on the top of the inserts were removed. Inserts were then
fixed with methanol and stained with 0.5% crystal violet
(Sigma-Aldrich) for 10 minutes, and relative number of
cells was quantified by measuring absorbance at 570 nm.

Oligonucleotide

Human glioma cells were plated in 60-mm dishes (3 x
105 cells per dish). After 18 hours, we used Lipofectamine
2000 (Invitrogen) to transfect the cells with 40 nM Tie2
small interfering RNA (siRNA) or scrambled siRNA
oligonucleotides (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) according
to Invitrogen’s instructions as previously reported and
validated [12-13].

Glioma-to-Endothelial Cell Adhesion Assay
HUVECs were seeded onto 24-well plates (1 x
105 cells/well) 48 hours before adhesion assay. Glioma
cells were labeled with PKH26 red dye (2 x 10–6 M;
Sigma) according to the manufacturer’s instructions,
resuspended in serum-free medium, and seeded onto
HUVEC monolayers at a 5:1 glioma cell–to–EC ratio, and
incubated at 37ºC. After 15 minutes, we removed nonadherent glioma cells and used fluorescence microscopy
(Axiovert 200; Carl Zeiss MicroImaging Inc) to visualize
the adhesion of glioma cells to ECs. We then used a 0.05%
trypsin/0.02% EDTA (w/v) solution to disrupt aggregates
and provide a single-cell suspension for glioma cell
quantification by flow cytometry (FACS Calibur; Becton
Dickinson). Data were processed using CellQuest Pro
software (BD Biosciences).
For calcium-chelating experiments, we preincubated glioma cells with 1 mM EDTA for 20 minutes
and we added 1mM neutralizing antibodies for 15 minutes
before and during co-culture with ECs: anti-N-cadherin
(clone GC4; 1:30 dilution; Sigma), anti-integrin ß1
antibody (clone 6S6; 10 µg/ml; Chemicon International),
and anti-human VEGF antibody (MAB293; 1µg/ml;
R&D Systems). Mouse IgG1 (MAB002) or IgG2B isotypes
(MAB004; R&D Systems) were used as controls.

3D glioma cultures and invasion assay
To generate glioma cell spheres, 1×104 glioma cells
suspended in 100µl DMEM/F12 medium were seeded
into a 96-well plate coated with 1% agarose gel and
incubated overnight. 96-well plates were coated with
collagen-enriched Matrigel, which consisted on mixing
on ice the neutralized collagen I (R&D systems) and
growth factor reduced Matrigel (BD Bioscience) such that
the final collagen concentration was 1.6 mg/ml. Then, the
wells were incubated for 20 minutes in 37°C for gelling.
Glioma cell spheres were transferred into these collagenenriched Matrigel-coated 96-well plates, and subsequently
overlaid with another layer of 50µl neutralized collagen.
After solidification of the upper layer for 15 minutes, 3D
cultures were incubated with 150µl serum-free DMEM/
F12 medium. When indicated, 500ng/ml Ang1 was both
incorporated into the collagen solution before gelling and
supplemented into the culture medium. For assessment
of invasion, we periodically analyzed by microscopy the
presence of invading individual cells and we measured
the major invasive front from the spheroid (completely
surrounded by the matrix and not in contact with the walls
of the well at any point).

Flow Cytometric Analysis
We used flow cytometry (FACSCalibur) to measure
cell-surface N-cadherin expression. We used 5 mM EDTA
to detach 1 x 106 glioma cells and incubated the cells

This study was supported by postdoctoral fellowships
from the American Brain Tumor Association (D.L.), and
Department of Education and Science, Spain (V.M.);
an Elsa U. Pardee Foundation Award (C.G.M.); an NHI
R01 NS069964 grant (C.G.M.); and a National Cancer
Institute Institutional Core Grant (CA16672; Research
Animal Support, Center Media Core; The University of
Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer).

Animal Studies
Animal studies were performed in veterinary
facilities at The University of Texas M. D. Anderson
Cancer Center in accordance with institutional guidelines.
To study whether Tie2 activation in crosstalk with the ECs
impacts tumorigenicity, we injected 1 x 106 U251.vector
or U251.Tie2 cells alone or in a suspension containing 2
x 105 HUVECs into the caudate nuclei of 4- to 6-weekold female athymic mice (Harlan-Sprague Dawley, Inc.)
as previously described [30]. To study Tie2 expression
in brain tumor stem cell (BTSC)-derived intracranial
xenografts, we implanted 5 x 105 GSC20 cells into the
caudate nuclei of 4- to 6-week-old female athymic mice
and sacrificed the animals when showing generalized
or localized symptoms of toxicity were sacrificed. We
removed the brains, fixed in 4% formalin, and embedded
them in paraffin. Hematoxylin and eosin–stained coronal
sections were evaluated for evidence and characterization
tumors.

For double immunofluorescence studies, tissue
sections were blocked with 10% goat serum following
heat-induced antigen retrieval and then incubated with antiTie2 antibody (C-20; 1:50; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and
anti-Nestin (MAB5326; 1:200, Chemicon International).
Texas red– and fluorescein isothiocyanate–conjugated
secondary antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology),
respectively, were used for 1 hour at room temperature.

using Student’s t tests, or for multiple comparisons using
two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). For enumeration
data analysis, the results were plotted as the frequencies.
Statistical significance between groups was determined
using chi-square analysis.
