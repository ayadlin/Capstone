ABSTRACT:
The Leucine Zipper Tumor Suppressor 1 (LZTS1) is a tumor suppressor gene,
located at chromosome 8p22, which is frequently altered in human cancer. In
normal tissue, its ubiquitous expression regulates cell mitosis by the stabilization
of microtubule networks. LZTS1-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts have been
shown to have an accelerated mitotic progression, and a higher resistance to taxanes,
microtubule-stabilizing drugs.
We investigate the role of Lzts1 in paclitaxel-resistance in breast cancer cells.
Downregulation of Lzts1 expression significantly decreases sensitivity to paclitaxel in
vitro. We further analyzed Lzts1 expression by immunohistochemistry in 270 primary
breast cancer samples and 16 normal breast specimens.
Lzts1 was significantly downregulated in breast cancer samples and its
deregulation was associated with a higher incidence of tumor recurrence, and to
a worse overall survival. Moreover, Lzts1-negative tumors were associated with
unfavorable outcome after taxanes-based therapy.
Thus our data suggest that Lzts1 deregulation is involved in breast cancer and its
immunohistochemical evaluation may serve as a prognostic factor for breast cancer
therapy

INTRODUCTION

Taxanes are potent cytotoxic microtubule-stabilizing
agents [4-7], which interact with beta-tubulin and arrest
cells at G2/M phase, blocking normal spindle assembly
and cell division. They are widely used in the treatment of
breast, ovarian, lung, and head and neck cancers [8-11]. In
breast cancer patients, paclitaxel offers significant benefits
in overall and disease-free survival in metastatic and earlystage cancers [12], and it is also given as neoadjuvant
treatment [13]. However, some patients are insensitive
to paclitaxel-based therapy and no biomarker is currently
available to adequately identify patients that are less

Breast cancer is the most common cancer and the
leading cause of cancer-related death in women worldwide
[1]. About 20-30% patients present with metastatic or
locally advanced cancer, and other 30% will develop
recurrent or metastatic disease [2]. Chemotherapeutic
options include serial administration of endocrine,
cytotoxic, or biologic therapies. Among the most
commonly used cytotoxic drugs for breast cancer are the
taxanes; paclitaxel (Taxol) and docetaxel (Taxotere) [3].

likely to be sensible to taxanes treatment, thus preventing
unnecessary side effects.
The leucine zipper putative tumor suppressor 1
(LZTS1, previously named FEZ1) gene was identified as
a tumor suppressor gene at 8p22 [14]. Lzts1 expression is
ubiquitously detected in normal tissues, but it is frequently
downregulated or absent in different human cancers [1521], including breast cancer [22]. LZTS1 deficient mice
develop cancers with diverse histogenetic backgrounds
[23, 24], suggesting that LZTS1 acts as a major tumor
suppressor gene in multiple cell types.
By the functional point of view, Lzts1 inhibits
cancer cell growth through the regulation of the mitotic
process [25]. Lzts1 controls Cdk1 activity by steadying
the Cdc25C phosphatase, a mitotic activator of Cdk1.
As a result, Lzts1 maintains high levels of Cdk1 activity
preventing chromosomes missegregation at the metaphase
plate. LZTS1 deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts
(MEFs) showed decreased Cdk1 during mitosis and
accelerated mitotic progression resulting in improper
chromosome segregation. Moreover, in the absence of
Lzts1, mouse fibroblasts displayed resistance to paclitaxeland nocodazole-induced M phase arrest [24].
To evaluate the potential use of Lzts1 as a
biomarker for the response of breast cancer to paclitaxel
treatment, we target endogenous LZTS1 by shRNA in
MCF7, MDA-MC231, MDA-MB463, and T-47D breast
cancer cells. We further analyzed Lzts1 expression by
immunohistochemistry in 270 primary breast cancer
samples and 16 normal breast specimens. These data
indicate an important role for LZTS1 deregulation in
breast cancer and support its immunohistochemical
evaluation as a prognostic tool for clinical applications in
breast cancer therapy.

Tet-off-inducible Lzts1 MCF7 clones (Figure 1). Western
blot analysis confirmed that the transgene expression was
regulated by tetracycline (Figure 1A). The upregulation
of Lzts1 was significantly associated to a worse IC50
in the presence of paclitaxel (0.5 nM vs 2 nM; Figures

RESULTS
Lzts1 downregulation decreases sensitivity to
paclitaxel in breast cancer cell lines.
Figure 1: Lzts1 expression sensitizes MCF7 cells to
paclitaxel. (A) Western blot analysis of Lzts1 expression

We have previously demonstrated that the loss of
Lzts1 in MEFs corresponds to an accelerated mitotic
progression, and a higher resistance to paclitaxel-induced
M phase arrest [24]. By interfering with microtubule
function, the taxanes (i.e. paclitaxel and docetaxel)
represent an important class of anti-neoplastic agents in
breast cancer treatment, and have been incorporated into
the management of breast cancer patients in association
with anthracyclins and trastuzumab where and when
appropriate [26].
To test Lzts1 role in taxanes resistance in breast
cancer, we investigate Lzts1 deregulation impact on
taxanes sensitivity in four breast cancer cell lines (MCF7,
MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-436, and T-47D). We first used
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

in Tet-off-inducible MCF7 Lzts1 cells treated or not with
tetracycline at different time points. Tetracycline significantly
downregulated Lzts1 expression. Protein loading was confirmed
by reprobing the membrane with an anti-Vinculin antibody.

concentration of paclitaxel in Tet-inducible MCF7 Lzts1 cells
treated (Lzts1+) or not (Lzts1-) with tetracycline. Cell viability
was plotted against the concentrations of paclitaxel used. Lzts1cells showed a significantly lower response to treatment until a
concentration of 10 nM paclitaxel. Values represent means of
triplicate experiments. (C) Representative microphotographs of

1B), showing that induced Lzts1 expression increased
sensitivity to the therapeutic. Moreover, culture of
Lzts1+ transfectants in medium with 2 nM of paclitaxel
showed an increased cell rounding and suffering behavior,
suggesting that Lzts1 is involved in paclitaxel-induced
microtubule stabilization in MCF7 cells (Figure 1C).
To further test this hypothesis, inducible MCF7 Lzts1
transfectant cells were exposed to 1 microM Oregon
Green paclitaxel (Molecular Probes) for 1 hr and then
analyzed by immunofluorescence. Lzts1-induced cells
show more distinct and well-organized microtubule
network by Oregon Green paclitaxel, respect to Lzts1uninduced transfectants (Supplementary Figure 1).
Overall, these results suggest that Lzts1 loss significantly
affects microtubule network, thus reducing microtubule
stabilization by paclitaxel.
Lzts1 downregulation was established by the use
of shRNA (shLzts1) in MCF7, MDA-MB-321, MDAMD-436, and T-47D human breast cancer cell lines.
LZTS1 knockdown was estimated to be 30-50% respect
to control shRNA (shNT) in MCF7, MDA-MB-231 and
T-47D cell lines by western blot and qRT-PCR analyses
(Figures 2A and 2B). MDA-MB-436 cells could not be
successfully transduced with anti-LZTS1 shRNA (Figure
2A). In order to evaluate the Lzts1-loss-related paclitaxel
resistance, transduced control shNT and shLzts1 cell
lines were treated or not with paclitaxel 100 nM and 1
microM and cell viability was tested by MTS assay
(Figure 2C and Supplementary Figure 2). As expected,
Lzts1 downregulated expression significantly decreased
the sensitivity of MCF7, MDA-MB-231 and T-47D
cell lines to paclitaxel compared with control (shNT)
transduced cells (p < 0.05). Moreover, MDA-MB-436
clones, which showed an unsuccessfully trasduction
with anti-LZTS1 shRNA, did not show any difference
by paclitaxel treatment among shNT and shLzts1. These
data demonstrate that downregulation of Lzts1 protein
relatively protects breast cancer cells from the cytotoxic
effects of paclitaxel.

The Oncomine data were confirmed by
immunohistochemical analysis of Lzts1 expression on
TMAs. A total of 270 breast cancer specimens were
evaluated (Table 1). The series comprised 205 ductal
carcinomas and 20 lobular carcinomas (45 cases with
different histotype or missing data). All the patients were
Caucasian.

control. Representative image of three separate transductions
are shown. shLzts1 led to a significant downregulation of Lzts1
expression in all, but not in the MDA-MB436 cell line. (B)
LZTS1 mRNA levels were evaluated by qRTPCR on breast
cancer cells after shNT and shLzts1 trasduction. As expected,
LZTS1 mRNA was significantly downregulated in shLzts1
MCF7, MDA-MB231, and T-47D clones. (C) Lzts1 expression
increases sensitivity to paclitaxel. Box plots show the OD value
obtained by reading the MTS plate at 490 nm of MCF7, and
MDA-MB-436 cell lines transduced with shNT and shLzts1,
treated or not with paclitaxel 100 nM (on the left) and 1 microM
(on the right). As expected, shLzts1 MDA-MB436 did not show
any significant difference in comparison to the control shNT.

Several recent studies pinpointed a significant
downregulation of Lzts1 in human tumors, as well as in
breast cancer [22]. To explore the clinico-pathological
and therapeutic significance of this association, we
investigated Lzts1 expression using the Oncomine
database and immunohistochemical analysis in a large
series of breast cancers.
The Oncomine database and gene microarray
data analysis tool enabled the meta-analysis of gene
expression in the breast cancer TCGA microarray studies
[27]. The analysis showed a significant LZTS1 mRNA
downregulation in invasive ductal (fold change -1.901;

3D) and to a worse overall survival (p=0.022; Figure 3E).
Since Lzts1 expression could affect the result of paclitaxel
treatment on different breast cell lines, we investigated
associations between Lzts1 expression levels and survival
stratifying patients between treated or not with taxanbased chemotherapy. Only in patients with absent Lzts1
expression (n=118), Kaplan-Meier curves showed a clear
and significantly trend to more unfavorable outcome after
taxan-based therapy (n=20; p=0.031). The low number of
Lzts1 2+ taxanes-treated patients did not consent further
investigations.
Furthermore to validate these study findings, we
confirm the deregulated LZTS1 expression on a different
patients cohort using the database published by Esserman
et al. (GEO: GSE22226) [28]. From the analysis of this
database, based on Agilent Human oligonucleotide
microarrays, we verify that patients who are non
responders to benefit from taxan-based chemotherapy
(n=62) showed a downregulation of LZTS1 expression
compared to patients who are responders to taxan-based
treatment (n=24) (Supplementary Figure 3).

We have further characterized Lzts1 as a putative protein
responsible for taxanes resistance in breast cancer
cells by affecting microtubule network. Lzts1 loss in
MCF7 inducible clones leads to a reduced microtubule
stabilization and organization, which is usually observed
after paclitaxel administration. A similar effect was
observed by LZTS1 targeting by shRNA technology.
Knockdown of endogenous LZTS1 caused resistance to
paclitaxel in MCF7, MDA-MB231 and T47D breast cancer
cells, but not in MDA-MB436 where Lzts1 expression
remained unchanged. A possible explanation for MDAMB436 ineffective transduction is that most transduced
cells likely die by apoptosis or mitotic catastrophe for
an improper cell division. In fact, microtubular poisons,
such as taxanes, lead to mitotic catastrophe by binding
to beta-tubulin and disrupting the mitotic spindle [7].
Overall these results confirm that the asbence/reduction of
Lzts1 expression impairs paclitaxel capability to interfere
with the normal disassembly of microtubules during cell
division.
In our seminal report [24], we described a
significant loss of Lzts1 expression in breast cancer
samples and cell lines. In recent years, Lzts1 has been
shown to be associated to metastatic disease and a
worse patients overall survival [32]. In this study, Lzts1
expression was tested in a large series of breast cancer
cases. As previously described, the Oncomine database
pinpointed a significant downregulation of LZTS1 mRNA
expression in breast cancer samples (p<0.001), which was
further confirmed by immunohistochemistry in a series
of 270 breast cancers and 16 normal breast specimens.
Lzts1 was significantly downregulated in breast cancer
(p<0.001), and its deregulation was associated to a higher
incidence of tumor recurrence (p=0.039) and of bone
marrow metastases (42.1% vs 16.7%). Lzts1 loss was
also associated to a worse overall survival (p=0.022). Of
interest, absent/low Lzts1 was significantly associated to
an unfavorable outcome after taxanes therapy (p=0.031).
These findings should be further confirmed in larger series
of taxanes-based clinical trials.
These results suggest that Lzts1 plays a critical role
in the resistance to paclitaxel, and may potentially serve as
a therapeutic target for overcoming paclitaxel resistance in
human breast cancer patients. Lzts1 immunohistochemical
evaluation could be useful as a prognostic tool for clinical
applications in breast cancer therapy.

DISCUSSION
Taxanes have been successfully introduced in the
polychemotherapy regiments for breast cancer treatment,
conferring an overall increased patients’ survival.
However, they are linked to a range of toxicities [29], and
thus the identification of predictive biomarkers of tumor
responsiveness is required. Data from two major taxane
trials [30, 31] provide evidence that ER and HER2 status
may aid the selection of patients benefiting from taxane
therapy. Nevertheless, no suitable biomarker has been
introduced into clinical practice so far.
In previous studies, we have identified LZTS1,
as a tumor suppressor gene mapping on chromosome
8p22, whose expression is altered in different human
malignancies, including breast cancer. Moreover, we
demonstrated that Lzts1 is ubiquitously expressed
in normal tissues and it regulates cell mitosis by the
stabilization of microtubule networks. In Lzts1-deficient
mouse embryonic fibroblasts, the mitotic progression is
accelerated and the cells are characterized by a higher
resistance to taxanes [24].
In this study, we investigated Lzts1 role in taxanesresistance in breast cancer, targeting endogenous LZTS1
by shRNA in MCF7, MDA-MC231, MDA-MB463,
and T-47D breast cancer cells. As described in MEFs,
downregulation of Lzts1 expression significantly
decreases the sensitivity to paclitaxel in vitro. Ishii et al.
[25] demonstrated that Lzts1 is involved in microtubule
assembly and its C-terminal portion is in association
with microtubules. These data suggest a correlation
between Lzts1 deregulated expression and microtubuletargeting chemotherapeutic sensitivity in cancer cells.

maintained in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium
(DMEM), supplemented with 2mM L-glutamine, 100 IU/
ml penicillin-streptomycin, and 10% FBS (Sigma).
Gene silencing of human LZTS1 was achieved by
shRNA strategies using lentiviral based sh constructs
(Invitrogen). For lentiviral production, 293FT cells
(Invitrogen) were co-transfected, using Lipofectamine
2000 (Invitrogen) with the lentiviral based sh constructs
and lentiviral system vectors pLP1, pLP2 and pVSV-G
(Invitrogen). 48 to 72 hours after transfection, medium
containing viral particles was used to transduce breast
cancer cell lines.

Patients
A series of 270 consecutive female breast cancer
patients were selected from the electronic archives of
the surgical Pathology Unit at Santa Chiara Hospital
(Trento), and considered for the immunohistochemistry
study. Duplicate TMA blocks that each contained single
0.2-mm cores sampled from representative paraffin
blocks from each patient were constructed. Patient tumor
paraffin blocks were assigned an anonymous unique
identifier linked to databases that contained pathological,
and clinical data. Estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone
receptor (PR), and HER2 (both immunohistochemical
and FISH) status were retrospectively obtained from the
original pathological reports. Tissues of patients who
received adjuvant and/or neoadjuvant chemotherapy
were included in the analysis. The clinical and pathologic
characteristics of the considered series are summarized in
Table 1. A total of 16 normal breast samples obtained from
reduction mammoplasty were also included. Institutional
review board approval was obtained for the use of patient
blocks and the institute’s ethical regulations concerning
research on human tissues were followed.

Preparation of cell lysate and immunoblotting
Cell lysates were prepared using cold NP-40 lysis
buffer plus a protease inhibitor cocktail (Complete,
Roche), 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, and 1mM
dithiothreitiol. Equivalent amounts of protein were loaded
on a Criterion Tris-HCl 4-20% pre-cast gel (Bio-Rad)
and transferred on nitrocellulose membranes. Anti-Lzts1
(GeneTex Inc) and anti-Vinculin (Sigma) were used
as primary antibodies. Isotype-matched, horseradishperoxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (GE
Healthcare) were used, followed by chemiluminescence
detection (Denville Scientific Inc).

Cell viability assay
Cell viability was detected using the CellTiter
96 Aqueous non-radioactive cell proliferation assay
(Promega), following supplier’s protocol. A reading of
OD 490 nm absorption with a Multilabel Counter (BioRad Laboratories) in a 96-well plate showed linear
compatibility with the number of cells in a range between
2000 and 5000 cells/well, counted by trypan blue staining
to exclude dead cells. Three independent assays were
performed for each experimental group.

Immunohistochemistry
Immunohistochemical stainings for Lzts1
(Amersham Pharmacia) were obtained on 4 micromthick sections and performed automatically (Dako
Autostainer immunostaining system; Dako), according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. IHC sections were lightly
counterstained with hematoxylin. Appropriate positive and
negative controls were run concurrently.
Lzts1 cytoplasmic expression was jointly scored by
two pathologists (MB and AV) unaware of any clinical
information. Lzts1 staining was classified on a threetiered scale based on the rate of positive tumor cells: 0,
staining in 0-5% of cells; 1+, staining in 5-80% of cells;
2+, staining in >80% of cells. In negative cancer samples,
Lzts1 expression in stromal/inflammatory cells and in
coexisting non-neoplastic epithelia (if any) served as a
positive internal control.

Reverse transcription and quantitative real time
PCR (qRT-PCT)
Total RNA was isolated using TRIZOL reagent
solution (Invitrogen) and reverse-transcribed using
random hexanucleotides as primers and MultiScribe
reverse transcriptase (Applied Biosystem). Quantitative
real time-PCR was performed with the SYBR Green PCR
Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) under the following
conditions: 10 min at 95 °C followed by 40 cycles (15 s
at 95 
°C and 1
