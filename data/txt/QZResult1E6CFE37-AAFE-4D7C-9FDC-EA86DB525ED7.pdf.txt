FLT3 Inhibitors in the Treatment of Acute
Myeloid Leukemia
The Start of an Era?
Naveen Pemmaraju, MD; Hagop Kantarjian, MD; Farhad Ravandi, MD; and Jorge Cortes, MD

Despite recent modest improvements in the chemotherapy regimens used to treat acute myeloid leukemia (AML),
many patients diagnosed with AML ultimately die of the disease. Commonly occurring genetic alterations have been
identified that strongly affect the prognosis for patients with AML. These alterations represent possible targets for
investigational therapies that could act to specifically halt the aberrant growth of AML cells while limiting damage to
normal cells. One such gene is the Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) gene, which is mutated in approximately 30% of
adult patients with AML and has a significant impact on prognosis. In particular, internal tandem duplications in FLT3
confer a poor prognosis to this large subgroup of patients with AML. Agents that target FLT3 are in development for
the treatment of patients who have AML and offer a potential paradigm change in the current standard treatment of
AML. For this report, the authors reviewed the prognostic significance of genetic alterations observed in AML with a
focus on the therapeutic implications of targeting FLT3. The introduction of such agents may be the next major step

KEYWORDS: acute myeloid leukemia, cytogenetics, FLT3 protein, molecular abnormalities.

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a heterogeneous disease characterized by uncontrolled proliferation of myeloid blast
cells and interference of the normal hematopoietic process.1 AML accounts for approximately 33% of all cases of leukemia
in the United States with an estimated 12,330 new cases of AML and 8950 AML-related deaths in 2010 alone.2 AML is
predominantly a disease of the elderly, and the median age at diagnosis is 67 years.3 The standard of care treatment for
AML has remained relatively unchanged over the past 4 decades. Therapy typically consists of intensive induction therapy,
most commonly with a combination of an anthracycline and cytarabine, followed by postremission treatment, which is
usually additional cytarabine-based chemotherapy or stem cell transplantation.4 This treatment is nonspecific and is inadequate for most patients.5 Long-term survival is achieved by approximately 30% to 40% of younger patients with AML
(aged < 60 years) but by only 5% to 10% of patients aged > 60 years.5 Improving the outcome of patients with AML will
require the development of new, targeted therapies and the definition of prognostic markers to identify patients who are
most likely to respond to treatment. Recently, an enhanced understanding of AML biology has led to the elucidation of
novel molecular markers, which serve as both prognostic features and potential targets for treatment. Consequently, new
agents are under investigation that specifically target pathophysiologic abnormalities that are required for the growth and
proliferation of AML cells while aiming to minimally affect normal cells. The era of personalized, targeted therapy has
arrived in the treatment of acute leukemias.
Cytogenetic and Molecular Alterations of AML
The prognosis for patients with AML varies dramatically and is strongly influenced by a number of factors, including age,
performance status, and cytogenetic and/or molecular alterations.6 The development of selective therapeutic agents and
the identification of patients who may benefit from these new treatments requires a good understanding of the mechanisms behind these genetic and molecular alterations as well as their influence on the course of the disease.

Cytogenetic abnormalities

Cytogenetic abnormalities occur in approximately
55% of adult patients with AML and have a major prognostic impact.6 Patients of all ages who have unfavorable
cytogenetics have poor 5-year survival rates that range
from 2% to 14% compared with rates from 34% to 65%
among patients who have favorable cytogenetics.7
Several different cytogenetic abnormalities have
been identified in AML, including numerical abnormalities (ie, losses or gains of chromosome segments or entire
chromosomes), translocations, and inversions.8 Defining
the prognostic impact of individual cytogenetic markers
and understanding their relation with other features that
impact treatment outcome, such as age and performance
status, are complex challenges.
A favorable prognosis is conferred by certain translocations or inversions, for example, the abnormal corebinding factor (CBF) mutations t(8;21)/runt-related transcription factor 1 (RUNX1)-RUNX1 translocated to 1
(cyclin D-related) (RUNX1-RUNX1T1), t(15;17)/promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor a (PMLRARA), and inv(16)/core-binding factor b-myosin heavy
chain 11 smooth muscle (CBFB-MYH11), which occur
in 10% to 15% of patients with AML.1,9-11 In contrast,
an unfavorable outcome is associated with most translocations that involve 11q23, which occur in 5% to 10% of
adult patients with AML and result in amplification of the
mixed-lineage leukemia gene (MLL).12 Trisomy 8, one of
the most common genetic abnormalities observed in
AML, confers an intermediate prognosis in the absence of
a complex karyotype.9 These patients can be stratified further by additional factors, such as age, into low-risk, intermediate-risk, and high-risk groups.13 Other commonly
occurring, AML-related numerical abnormalities include
monosomy of chromosomes 5 (5) and/or 7 (7) and
partial deletions of chromosomes 5 (del[5q]) or 7
(del[7q]).14 Typically, this group of abnormalities, known
collectively as ‘‘5/7,’’ confers a negative prognosis.
Outcomes in this group can be stratified further by favorable factors, including simple karyotype or no antecedent
hematologic disease.15
Molecular abnormalities

Approximately 50% of patients with AML are cytogenetically normal (ie, they have no detectable chromosomal abnormalities) and, as a group, have an
intermediate prognosis.16 Many of these patients (and
some with chromosomal abnormalities) carry genetic
alterations that lead to changes in gene expression, such as

3294

mutations or polymorphisms. These alterations are important for a more differential prognosis to help guide
treatment choices, and some specific mutations also may
be suitable as therapeutic targets (Table 1).16,17 Two main
classes of genetic alterations or mutations have been identified in patients with AML: Class 1 includes genetic alterations or mutations that result in a survival advantage for
and/or proliferation of hematopoietic progenitor cells,
and Class 2 includes genetic alterations or mutations that
cause hematopoietic cells to lose their ability to differentiate and undergo apoptosis. Collaboration between Class 1
and 2 mutations appears to be required for AML development.1 In addition, new subclasses are emerging based
on gene expression profiles and microRNA expression
signatures.51,52
The prognostic impact of a single mutation can be
stratified by the presence or absence of mutations in other
genes.53 For example, alterations in the most commonly
mutated gene in blasts from cytogenetically normal AML
patients, nucleophosmin-1 (NPM1), correlate with high
cytoplasmic localization of its product, nucleophosmin.
After standard therapy, NPM1 mutations confer a favorable prognosis.54 However, nearly 40% of patients with
AML whose blasts harbor mutations in NPM1 also have
mutations in Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) that
appear to abrogate this prognostic advantage.18,19
Mutations in FLT3 were among the first molecular
abnormalities identified in patients with AML. These
mutations likely confer the largest single-gene impact on
prognosis in AML and serve as potential therapy targets.
The remainder of this review is focused on the development of FLT3 inhibitors as an example of a rational, biology-driven, therapeutic approach in AML.
Role of FLT3 in Normal Hematopoiesis
FLT3 encodes a Class III receptor tyrosine kinase that
consists of 5 immunoglobulin-like domains, a transmembrane domain, a cytoplasmic juxtamembrane domain,
and 2 tyrosine kinase domains (Fig. 1).55-57 FLT3 is
expressed normally on bone marrow hematopoietic stem
cells, but this expression is lost as these cells differentiate.58 In coordination with other growth factors, FLT3
plays a crucial role in normal hematopoiesis and cellular
growth in primitive hematopoietic stem and progenitor
cells.58,59 It is noteworthy that FLT3 appears to play this
role not only in early progenitor cells but also in progenitors farther along the granulocyte/macrophage pathway,
including common myeloid progenitors and granulocyte/
macrophage progenitors.60

Role of FLT3 in AML
FLT3 is expressed on the leukemic cells in 70% to 100%
of patients with AML. In addition, activating mutations
in FLT3 are observed in approximately 30% of adult
patients with AML. Constitutively active, mutant FLT3
results in the proliferation and survival of leukemic blasts.1
Two forms of FLT3-activating mutations are identified
commonly in the blasts from patients with AML—internal tandem duplications (ITDs) and point mutations.
Internal tandem duplications (ITDs) are changes
that are observed in approximately 25% of all patients
with AML.21 The duplications lead to an additional 3 to
 100 amino acids inserted into the receptor,61 resulting
in the ligand-independent, constitutive activation of
FLT3.62 Until recently, ITDs had been identified only in
the juxtamembrane domain of the protein; however,
recent work has established that approximately 33% of
ITDs occur within the tyrosine kinase domain.63
Point mutations are changes that occur in both the
tyrosine kinase domain and the juxtamembrane domain,
and they are observed in approximately 5% of all patients
with AML.64,65 Both lead to the constitutive activation of
FLT3; however, point mutations in the juxtamembrane
domain appear to result in less activation compared with

kinase domain point mutations and ITDs of the juxtamembrane domain.65
In addition to ITDs and point mutations, overexpression of FLT3 has been detected in both adult and pediatric patients with AML without FLT3 mutations, and
this overexpression may have an unfavorable prognostic
impact on overall survival (OS).30,31
Prognostic Implications of FLT3 Mutation
The negative impact of FLT3-ITD mutations on prognosis has been confirmed in multiple studies.21,22 AML
patients with FLT3-ITD mutations who receive standard
treatment may have lower complete response (CR) rates
and, significantly, may have significantly shorter diseasefree survival (DFS) and OS.22,66 The degree to which the
FLT3 mutant allele is expressed also may affect outcome.
Patients who had FLT3-ITD mutations with no detectable wild-type FLT3 had shorter DFS and OS compared
with patients who had FLT3-ITD mutations with detectable wild-type FLT3.22 Similarly, patients who expressed
mutant FLT3/wild-type FLT3 allele ratios > 0.78 had
shorter DFS and OS compared with patients who lacked
FLT3 mutations.21 The importance of FLT3 allele burden in patients with NPM1-mutated AML recently was

3295

Review Article

determined.67 Typically, patients with NPM1-mutated
AML have a favorable prognosis. However, an FLT3ITD/wild-type ratio of  0.5 had a significant negative
impact on prognosis in patients with NPM1-mutated
AML. Thus, although FLT3-ITD status alone is informative in the clinic, the FLT3-ITD allele burden may provide further information. The negative prognostic
influence of the FLT3-ITD mutation is observed across
age groups, and patients who have FLT3-ITD mutations
range in age from infants to elderly adults aged  60 years,
and all have a negative prognosis compared with agematched patients without FLT3-ITD mutations.68-71

Clinical Trials Using FLT3 Inhibitors
FLT3 inhibitors are under investigation as single agents
and in combination with other therapies in relapsed and
refractory populations as well as newly diagnosed populations. In a retrospective analysis of OS among 213
patients who were treated on several studies at The
University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center and
received FLT3 inhibitors as part of their initial therapy or
as salvage therapy, patients with wild-type FLT3 and mutant FLT3 had similar OS despite the expected inferior
outcome for the patients with FLT3 mutations.83
Relapsed/refractory/poor risk patients:
Single-agent studies

FLT3 Inhibitors in Preclinical Studies
Several FLT3 inhibitors, including monoclonal antibodies
and tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), have demonstrated
antitumor activity in preclinical studies. TKIs block the
aberrant signal transduction that contributes to tumor cell
development. Several TKIs are under clinical development, including midostaurin (PKC-412),72 lestaurtinib
(CEP-701),73 sorafenib (BAY 43-9006),74 sunitinib
(SU11248),75 KW-2449,76 AC220,77 AP-24534,78
SB1518,79 and ITR-260.80 A recent study analyzed the
ability of many of these agents to inhibit both wild-type
and FLT3-ITD receptors in vitro and their cytotoxic
effects against primary FLT3-ITD mutant blast samples
obtained from patients with AML.81 All of the agents
were capable of inhibiting both wild-type and FLT3-ITD
autophosphorylation, although generally less inhibition
was observed against the wild-type receptor. The agents
can be broadly classified as highly selective (eg, AC220,
sorafenib), intermediate (eg, sunitinib, KW-2449), and
less selective (eg, lestaurtinib, midostaurin). It is noteworthy that, in one study, the selective inhibition of FLT3
alone was insufficient for in vitro induction of cytotoxicity
in FLT3-ITD blasts obtained from some patients with
newly diagnosed AML. The authors suggested that the
greatest clinical utility of FLT3 inhibitors may be derived
by treating newly diagnosed patients with a less selective
agent and treating relapsed patients with a more selective
agent.81 In addition, allelic burden was correlated with the
in vitro activity of these agents.
Also under development is an anti-FLT3 monoclonal antibody, IMC-EB10, which blocks signaling by binding to the receptor and also induces antibody-dependent
cell-mediated cytotoxicity.82 Preclinical studies have confirmed the antiproliferative effects of IMC-EB10 against
both wild-type FLT3 and mutant FLT3 AML models.82

Lestaurtinib

This agent, also known as CEP-701, demonstrated
safety, tolerability, and clinical activity in a phase 1/2
study that examined patients with refractory, relapsed, or
poor-risk AML who had FLT3 mutations.84 Fourteen
patients with a median age of 61 years received lestaurtinib 60 mg twice daily. Clinical activity was observed in 5
patients, including lowered peripheral blood blasts. Some
patients also had evidence of stabilized normal
hematopoiesis, as evidenced by transfusion independence.
Commonly observed toxicities included grade 1/2 nausea
and emesis (41% and 29%, respectively), and grade 3/4
generalized weakness (18%). Lestaurtinib at a dose of 60
mg twice daily also was tested as a single agent in a phase 2
study that included older patients with AML (median age,
73 years) who were not considered fit for standard chemotherapy.85 Unlike the prior study, this study was not restricted by FLT3 mutational status. Transient reductions
in peripheral blood and bone marrow blasts as well as longer periods of transfusion independence were observed in
3 of 5 patients (60%) with FLT3 mutations and in 5 of 23
patients (23%) with wild-type FLT3. Similar adverse
events (AEs) were observed as in the initial phase 1/2 trial.
It is noteworthy that the study also included extensive correlative laboratory analyses, which did not reveal a link
between baseline FLT3 expression or mutation and the
likelihood of achieving a response to lestaurtinib. However, in a separate study, a clear correlation was observed
between the results from an ex vivo bioassay, which
revealed plasma inhibitory activity for FLT3 in patients
who received FLT3 inhibitors versus clinical response.86
Those patients for whom FLT3 inhibitors demonstrated
high plasma inhibitory activity ex vivo tended to be the
best clinical responders to FLT3 inhibitor therapy. This
finding suggests that it may be possible to monitor a

particular patient’s plasma drug level to individually tailor
the drug dose to achieve optimal FLT3 inhibition.
Midostaurin

The tolerability of midostaurin (PKC412) was
determined in a phase 1 study.87 A phase 2 proof-of-concept trial was initiated in which patients (n ¼ 20) with
FLT3 mutations who had relapsed/refractory AML or
myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) received single-agent
midostaurin at a dose of 75 mg orally 3 times daily.88
Although the trial was open to all patients aged  18
years, the median patient age was 62 years. A  50%
decrease in peripheral blood and/or bone marrow blast
counts was observed in 70% of patients. Seven patients
(35%) achieved a > 2-log reduction in blast count for
more than 4 weeks. Overall, the drug was well tolerated,
and the most commonly observed AEs were grade 1/2
nausea and vomiting. A phase 2b study of midostaurin in
patients with AML and MDS who had either wild-type
FLT3 (n ¼ 60) or mutant FLT3 (n ¼ 35) also has been
reported in which the patients received midostaurin 50
mg or 100 mg twice daily as a single agent.89 In that study,
64% of patients were aged  65 years. Among the 92
patients who were evaluable for response, 71% of patients
who had mutant FLT3 had a  50% reduction in peripheral blood or bone marrow blasts compared with 42% of
patients who had wild-type FLT3. One partial response
was observed in a patient with mutant FLT3 on the 100mg dose regimen. Grade 1/2 nausea and vomiting were
the most common AEs and were observed in 60% and
48% of patients, respectively. It is noteworthy that there
was no association between AEs and dose or mutational
status. FLT3 autophosphorylation was inhibited in most
of the responding patients, indicating in vivo target inhibition at the dose schedule used in that study.88
Sorafenib

Sorafenib (BAY 43-9006)—a multikinase inhibitor
that targets the v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1 (B-RAF), platelet-derived growth factor
(PDGFR), fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR), and
FLT3,74,90—currently is approved for the treatment of
metastatic renal cancer and advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.91 FLT3 tyrosine kinase inhibition by sorafenib was
established in primary human AML cells and in a mouse
leukemia xenograft model and had a negligible effect on
leukemic cells with wild-type FLT3, FLT3 kinase domain
mutations, and normal hematopoietic progenitors.90 Sorafenib has been investigated as a targeted agent against

FLT3-mutated AML. It was demonstrated that sorafenib
was safe and had clinical activity in 2 phase 1 trials that
examined the effects of both dose and schedule of sorafenib in patients with relapsed or refractory AML.92,93 In
the first trial, 15 heavily pretreated patients were recruited,
and 10 of those patients received a full cycle of sorafenib
(3 patients discontinued the study because of disease progression, and 2 discontinued because of complications
from infections). Sorafenib was well tolerated, and 6 of 10
patients (60%) who received at least 1 cycle of sorafenib
achieved a response, which most frequently was manifested by a profound decrease in peripheral blood and/or
bone marrow blasts. However, responses were transient;
and, predictably, they were observed only in patients who
had FLT3-ITD mutations.92 The second phase 1 trial
explored greater dose escalation in a 15-patient cohort
with refractory leukemias, because the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was not achieved in the previous trial.
An MTD of sorafenib 400 mg twice daily for a 21-day
cycle was determined. The most common grade 3 or
higher AEs consisted of fatigue (16%) and hypokalemia
(13%). Stable disease was achieved by 11 of 15 patients
(73%), and 6 of those patients (40%) had a reduction in
bone marrow blasts after only 1 cycle of treatment. However, once again, the responses were transient in nature.93
A randomized phase 1 trial that examined 2 schedules
of sorafenib, either continuous or intermittent, at 4 dose
levels (100 mg, 200 mg, 300 mg, or 400 mg; all given twice
daily) was conducted by the National Cancer Institute of
Canada in patients with relapsed or refractory AML (n ¼
38) or untreated MDS (n ¼ 4).94 Dose-limiting toxicity
(DLT) was prevalent at the 400 mg twice-daily dose, but
no DLTs were observed at the 300 mg twice-daily dose.
Furthermore, sorafenib was well tolerated on a continuous
schedule, resulting in the recommended schedule of 300
mg twice daily continuously for 28-day cycles in that
patient population. The vast majority of drug-related AEs
in that study were gastrointestinal-related events: Thirtyeight percent of all patients experienced grade 1/2 diarrhea
or abdominal pain (13 patients had grade 1/2 AEs; and 3
patients had grade 3, 4, or 5 AEs). One CR was noted in a
patient with FLT3-ITD–positive AML.94
Sorafenib administered either before or after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) also has been
explored in a small group of patients with relapsed or
refractory, FLT3-ITD–positive AML.95 Sorafenib treatment occurred before allo-SCT (n ¼ 2), after allo-SCT (n
¼ 3), or both before and after allo-SCT (n ¼ 1). Sorafenib-induced remission allowed for allo-SCT in 2 of the 3

3297

Review Article

refractory patients. Two of the 4 patients who received
sorafenib after allo-SCT survived for 216 days and 221
days, respectively, whereas the other 2 patients remained
in ongoing complete molecular remission.95
A recent case study also reported the use of sorafenib
in an FLT3-ITD–positive woman aged 43 years with extramedullary disease who relapsed after she underwent alloSCT.96 The antitumor activity of sorafenib was demonstrated in this patient, who achieved a molecular remission.
Sunitinib

Two phase 1 trials have been conducted in AML
patient cohorts examining sunitinib (SU11248), a smallmolecule inhibitor of RAF, vascular endothelial growth factor 2, c-KIT, and FLT3.97 Sunitinib is approved for use in
patients with advanced renal cancer or gastrointestinal stromal tumors who are resistant or intolerant of imatinib. A
phase 1, single-agent, dose-finding study of sunitinib was
conducted in 16 patients with AML who were either refractory or not amenable to conventional therapy.98 The majority of those patients (67%) were aged > 65 years. No DLTs
were observed in the 13 patients who received a starting dose
of sunitinib 50 mg daily; the most frequent grade 2 AEs consisted of mild edema, fatigue, and oral ulcerations. The 75mg daily dose received by 2 patients resulted in 1 episode
each of grade 4 fatigue, hypertension, and cardiac failure,
which resulted in the elimination of this dose level from further evaluation. All 4 patients with FLT3 mutations had
morphologic responses (absence of leukemic blasts from peripheral blood, < 5% blasts in bone marrow, peripheral
level of hemoglobin > 90 g/L, and an absolute neutrophil
count > 1  109/L) or partial responses (a reduction of the
absolute blast count in peripheral blood and bone marrow
blast percentage by 50% compared with baseline) compared
with only 2 of 10 evaluable patients who had wild-type
FLT3. All responses were of short duration, although the
responses were longer in patients who had mutated FLT3.
AC220

AC220 is a TKI that targets KIT, colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R), rearranged during transfection (RET), and PDGFR, but its greatest activity is
against FLT3. AC220 has been explored in a phase 1
dose-finding and safety trial in 76 elderly patients with either relapsed or refractory AML or untreated AML.99 The
MTD was identified as AC220 200 mg once daily on a
continuous dosing schedule. Pharmacokinetic evaluation
of treated patients revealed that AC220 potently inhibited
phosphorylated FLT3 in FLT3-ITD cells at this dose.

3298

AC220 had significant clinical activity, inducing not only a
reduction in blast counts but a full CR in some patients.
Overall, 10 of 76 patients (13%) patients achieved a CR (2
CRs, 6 CRs with incomplete blood count recovery, and 2
CRs with incomplete platelet recovery) and 13 patients
(17%) achieved a partial response. Most responses were
observed during the first 28-day cycle of treatment. The
median duration of response was 14 weeks with response
durations up to 67 weeks and beyond. Higher overall
response rates and CR rates were observed in patients who
had FLT3-ITD mutations (56% and 28%, respectively)
compared with patients who lacked those mutations (20%
and 7%, respectively). The most commonly reported AEs
that may have been drug-related were mainly grade 2 and
included peripheral edema, dysgeusia, and nausea.99
KW-2449

A phase 1, ascending-dose study of KW-2449 was
conducted in patients with acute leukemias.100 In vitro
studies determined that the cytotoxic effect of KW-2449
ocurred at concentrations sufficient to inhibit FLT3
autophosphorylation to < 20% of baseline. Transient
reductions in peripheral blast counts were observed in the
patients, and quantitative measurements of FLT3 inhibition determined that FLT3 itself was inhibited only transiently to < 20% of baseline. This study was terminated
because the chosen dose was insufficient. A second, phase
1/2 trial aimed at determining the optimal dose of KW2449 was recently also terminated because of failure to
establish a tolerable dose that had potential efficacy.101
Other agents that have demonstrated preclinical activity currently are being explored in phase 1/2 trials,
including AP-24534 and the monoclonal antibody IMCEB10 (Table 2).
Combination with chemotherapy

Single-agent studies of FLT3-inhibitory TKIs have
revealed that these agents generally are well tolerated but
usually are limited by transient clinical activity. Therefore,
several agents are being explored in combination with
other therapies.

receive either chemotherapy alone or chemotherapy followed by lestaurtinib 80 mg twice daily. The chemotherapy regimen used was determined according to the
duration of initial remission; if the initial remission lasted
from 1 to 6 months, then patients received mitoxantrone,
etoposide, and cytarabine; whereas patients who had an
initial remission of 6 to 24 months received high-dose
cytarabine. Overall, the addition of lestaurtinib failed to
increase response rates or to prolong the survival of
patients with FLT3-mutant AML in first relapse. However, cytotoxicity analyses also were performed on the
blasts from patients who received lestaurtinib to gauge
their in vitro sensitivity to the drug with a target of >
85% FLT3 inhibition defined from previous studies. Of
79 patients who were tested, 46 patients (58%) achieved
this degree of FLT3 inhibition on Day 15 of treatment.
Of these 46 ‘‘biologic responders,’’ 18 (39%) achieved a
CR, whereas only 3 of 32 patients (9%) who exhibited
FLT3 inhibition < 85% achieved a CR.103 The authors
concluded that FLT3 inhibition by lestaurtinib, when
achieved, was correlated with better CR rates but that this
benefit was negated by a poor CR rate in those patients
who did not achieve the FLT3 inhibition target. However,

these results suggest that, if a more profound and sustained FLT3 inhibition could be achieved, then a favorable effect in long-term outcome might be expected.
Newly diagnosed patients
Midostaurin

A phase 1b study in previously untreated adult
patients with AML aged  60 years was conducted with
midostaurin added either in sequence or concomitantly
with daunorubicin and cytarabine induction chemotherapy.104 Patients with both mutant and wild-type FLT3
were included. During the trial, the dose and schedule
were amended twice to identify a well tolerated option
that did not result in a high discontinuation rate. The final
dosage regimen was midostaurin 50 mg twice daily on
Days 1 through 8 and 15 through 21 (concomitant) or on
Days 8 through 21. Of the 40 patients enrolled at the 50
mg twice daily dose, 27 patients had wild-type FLT3, and
13 patients had mutant FLT3. The overall CR rate was
not affected by the midostaurin administration schedule:
A CR was observed in 32 of 40 patients (80%) in the
entire cohort, including 20 of 77 all patients (74%) with
wild-type FLT3 and 12 of 13 patients (92%) with mutant

FLT3. It is noteworthy that OS was similar between the
mutant FLT3 and wild-type FLT3 groups, suggesting to
the authors that the addition of midostaurin may have
overcome the adverse prognostic effect of FLT3 mutations. The encouraging results observed in the patients
with FLT3 mutations led to further pursuit of this strategy
in an ongoing phase 3, randomized trial (Table 2) that
included induction (daunorubicin/cytarabine) and consolidation (high-dose cytarabine) with either midostaurin
or placebo in patients with newly diagnosed FLT3mutated AML aged < 60 years who were stratified
according to their FLT3 allele burden into 3 groups: ITD
allelic ratio < 0.7, ITD allelic ratio  0.7, and those with
point mutations.
Sorafenib

Sorafenib is currently under investigation in a phase
1/2 trial combined concomitantly with idarubicin and

3300

cytarabine in newly diagnosed patients aged < 65
years.105 In the phase 1 portion of that trial, patients
received escalating doses and various schedules of sorafenib, and continuous dosing at 400 mg twice daily was
established as the phase 2 dose. In the phase 1 portion, 10
patients were treated, including 7 who had FLT3-ITD
mutations and had received a median of 2 previous regimens. A CR was achieved by 4 patients, including 3 who
had FLT3-ITD mutations. The phase 2 portion included
51 patients (15 with FLT3-ITD mutations and 2 with
FLT3 point mutations) with previously untreated AML.
Their median age was 53 years. Of 51 evaluable patients,
38 (75%) achieved a CR, including 12 of 13 patients
(92%) who had FLT3-ITD mutations, 2 of 2 patients
(100%) who had FLT3 point mutations, and 24 of 36
patients (66%) who had wild-type FLT3. The difference in
the CR rate between patients with mutated FLT3 and
patients with wild-type FLT3 was statistically significant (P

¼ .033). The regimen was well tolerated. The grade 3 AEs,
possibly related to the addition of sorafenib to induction
chemotherapy, included hyperbilirubinemia in 4 patients,
elevated transaminases in 5 patients, and diarrhea in 4
patients, most of which were generally transient. After at a
median follow-up of 54 weeks, the probability of survival
was 83% at 6 months and 74% at 12 months. Among the
patients who had mutated FLT3, 10 patients had relapsed
and 5 remained in CR at a median follow-up of 62 weeks
(range, 10-76 weeks). Correlative studies determined that,
in addition to suppressing the activity of mutant FLT3 in
these patients, sorafenib effectively down-regulated the
expression of phosphorylated extracellular signal-related kinase, which acts downstream of FLT3 to promote cell survival and proliferation in AML cells.106
Conclusions
Recent advances in the understanding of AML biology
have led to significant contributions in the prognostic
classification of patients. Most important, this deeper
understanding has given us the opportunity for therapeutic intervention. An understanding of the molecular complexity of cytogenetically normal patients with AML and
the associated heterogeneity in their outcomes has led to
efforts to develop rationally designed, personalized therapy for these specific subgroups of patients, such as FLT3
inhibitors. Growing evidence suggests that these agents
have clear clinical value for patients with AML, and particularly for those who have FLT3 mutations. Considering the complex molecular events that characterize AML
and the variable characteristics of these agents and their
interaction with other agents, our challenge will be to better understand and properly manage these agents to
achieve their full potential. The introduction of FLT3
inhibitors for the treatment of AML may well be the start
of a new era in the management of this disease after many
frustrating years of exclusive dependency on cytotoxic
chemotherapy.
