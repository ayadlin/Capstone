BACKGROUND: The authors hypothesized that intensified chemotherapy in protocol HIT-GBM-C would increase survival
of pediatric patients with high-grade glioma (HGG) and diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG). METHODS: Pediatric
patients with newly diagnosed HGG and DIPG were treated with standard fractionated radiation and simultaneous chemotherapy (cisplatin 20 mg/m2  5 days, etoposide 100 mg/m2  3 days, and vincristine, and 1 cycle of cisplatin þ etoposide þ ifosfamide 1.5 g/m  5 days [PEI] during the last week of radiation). Subsequent maintenance chemotherapy
included further cycles of PEI in Weeks 10, 14, 18, 22, 26, and 30, followed by oral valproic acid. RESULTS: Ninety-seven
(pons, 37; nonpons, 60) patients (median age, 10 years; grade IV histology, 35) were treated. Resection was complete in 21
patients, partial in 29, biopsy only in 26, and not performed in 21. Overall survival rates were 91% (standard error of the
mean [SE]  3%), 56%, and 19% at 6, 12, and 60 months after diagnosis, respectively. When compared with previous protocols, there was no significant benefit for patients with residual tumor, but the 5-year overall survival rate for patients with
complete resection treated on HIT-GBM-C was 63%  12% SE, compared with 17%  10% SE for the historical control group
(P ¼ .003, log-rank test). CONCLUSIONS: HIT-GBM-C chemotherapy after complete tumor resection was superior to

KEYWORDS: glioblastoma, diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma, chemotherapy, resection, children.

High -grade glioma (HGG) is a term encompassing various histologically defined brain tumors linked by glial origin
and poor prognosis. The most frequent entities are glioblastoma multiforme (World Health Organization [WHO] grade
IV1) and anaplastic astrocytoma (WHO grade III). In pediatrics, diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) is sometimes
included in this disease group.2-5
For HGG, there is a consensus that chemotherapy plays a limited role.6-10 Temozolomide is the standard treatment
for adult patients with HGG.11,12 The beneficial effect of radiation and complete surgical resection therapy is generally
accepted.10,13,14 In children, survival rates are higher than in adults, which may be because of more intensive chemotherapy protocols or because pediatric HGG differs biologically from HGG in adults.15
DIPGs are astrocytic tumors that occur almost exclusively in the pediatric population.14,15 Given the lack of prognostic relevance of histological diagnoses and the impossibility of achieving complete surgical resection, the standard of
care is to treat these patients without histological confirmation.15,16 Radiation therapy is known to extend survival by half

a year and to temporarily ameliorate neurological deficits,
but the tumors recur.16,17 A beneficial role of chemotherapy has been suggested,17 but it has yet to be confirmed
by prospective phase 3 studies.
The HIT-GBM study is a prospective cohort comparison study.18 After a previous randomized trial had
to be closed because of lack of accrual,10 the HIT-GBM
concept was to evaluate sequential, consecutive, treatment protocols. The first protocol (HIT-GBM-A) consisted of trophosphamide and etoposide,18-21 the second
(HIT-GBM-B) of intensive chemotherapy with simultaneous radiation22 followed by interferon gamma maintenance treatment.23,24 Only the induction treatment
appeared to be superior to the other HIT-GBM protocols.22 Therefore, with the third cohort (HIT-GBM-C),
we evaluated the effect of a prolongation of the same
type of treatment. Valproic acid was added in the third
cohort.25

travenous infusion on Days 1 to 5. Mesna (500 mg/m2)
was given as an injection before and 4 and 8 hours after
ifosfamide. The cycle was placed at the end of the radiation treatment because it was expected to cause bone marrow suppression; this would have cause a risk for
interruption of radiation if the cycle was given earlier.22
The infusion times of ifosfamide and cisplatin were separated by positioning the etoposide infusion in between, so
that mesna was not infused during cisplatin infusion or at
times of peak plasma levels.26,27 After radiation therapy,
the chemotherapy continued with further cycles of PEI in
Weeks 10, 14, 18, 22, 26, and 30, as well as vincristine in
Weeks 13, 17, 21, 25, and 29. Then, valproic acid was
started at 10 mg/kg/day orally for 1 week and 20 mg/kg/
day in Week 2.25,28-30 Serum levels were then checked,
and the dose was further increased to reach target serum
levels of 100-150 lg/mL, unless side effects had occurred
at lower levels. Tumor status was re-evaluated after every
other chemotherapy cycle.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Eligibility Criteria
The main eligibility criterion was either histologically
proven HGG or DIPG. HGG was defined as grade III
or grade IV (WHO) astrocytic or oligodendroglial
tumors. Central review of histology specimens was provided by the Department of Neuropathology, University of Bonn (Germany). The definition of DIPG
included a symptom history of <6 months, tumor centered in the pons, tumor extension over >50% of the
pontine cross-sectional area, and no contrast enhancement on MRI. The images were centrally reviewed
(Wurzburg, Germany). Biopsy was recommended if
pontine tumors appeared to have enhanced contrast,
and the patients were excluded if their histology showed
anything but astrocytic tumor. However, histological
grading was irrelevant to eligibility when the MRI morphology was typical. Also eligible were patients with
gliomatosis cerebri, as defined by radiological imaging
of diffuse involvement of more than 2 lobes in the presence of astrocytic histology, which had to be WHO
grade II or higher. Further eligibility criteria included
primary diagnosis of a glioma, age of 3-18 years, institutional review board approval, and informed consent.
Secondary gliomas that occurred after malignancies,
such as leukemia, were not excluded as this has been the
definition of the population in the previous protocols,
too. To be eligible in this treatment protocol analysis,
one further eligibility criterion was that patients had
to receive chemotherapy and radiation therapy

Chemotherapy Protocol
The postoperative treatment protocol started after early
postoperative magnetic imaging (MRI) scans. Spinal MRI
was recommended for staging but not mandatory. Nonsurgical treatment started with simultaneous radiation
therapy and chemotherapy induction, followed by maintenance chemotherapy and histone deacetylase inhibition.
Radiation was recommended within 14 days after diagnosis and was given to the tumor and a 2-cm margin in 5
1.8-Gy fractions per week, up to a total of 54 Gy for
patients 6 years and younger, as well as to brainstem locations and up to 59.4 Gy for older patients with tumors in
other locations. Chemotherapy started during the first
week of radiation therapy. The first cycle consisted of cisplatin, etoposide, and vincristine (PEV).22 Hydration at
2.4 L/m2/24 hours started at least 8 hours before cisplatin
administration and was given until 24 hours after completion of the chemotherapy. Cisplatin was given over 1 hour
at a dose of 20 mg/m2/day on Days 1 to 5. Etoposide 100
mg/m2 was given over 2 hours on Days 1 to 3, always after
cisplatin. Vincristine was injected at a dose of 1.5 mg/m2
(maximum, 2 mg) on Day 5 only to avoid reducing the
DNA binding of cisplatin by means of vincristine-mediated cell arrest. Weekly vincristine followed, and during
the last week of radiation therapy, 1 cycle of cisplatin, etoposide, and ifosfamide (PEI) was given. The doses of cisplatin and etoposide were the same as with PEV.
Ifosfamide (1.5 g/m2/day) and were given as a 1-hour in-

simultaneously, defined as starting chemotherapy not
earlier than 2 days before and not later than 2 weeks after starting radiation. The completeness of resection was
not part of the eligibility criteria, but it was reported
following Gnekow criteria.31 Beginning treatment
within 14 days after diagnosis was recommended, but
delayed treatment was not an exclusionary criteria.
Statistics
Statistical analyses were performed using the Statistical
Package for Social Studies software (SPSS 12.0; Chicago,
Ill). MRIs and clinical evaluations were completed after
every other chemotherapy cycle to evaluate response. On
the basis of previous results,10 the survival analysis was
performed separately for 1) patients with completely
resected tumors, 2) patients with pontine tumors, and 3)
others. The previously determined endpoint, ie, overall
survival, remained unchanged. By using Kaplan Meier
estimates, we compared the historical control group of
patients treated on either protocol A20,21 or protocol
B22,24 with patients treated on protocol HIT-GBM-C in
the subgroups a, b, and c. For the main hypothesis that
the new protocol resulted in superior overall survival, a
P-value below .05 was considered statistically significant.
Subgroup analyses (log-rank test) and multivariate analysis (COX regression) were used to explore the relevance of
inhomogeneity of risk factors for the conclusions.10 This
was exploratory, not hypothesis driven, and, therefore, no
P value was set to define significance.
For response description,20,25 patients with no residual tumors were classified as having continuation of
complete remission (CCR) or progressive disease (PD).
Patients with measurable tumor after the first surgery
were classified as having a complete response (CR), partial response (PR, tumor <50%), stable disease (SD, tumor <125% and 50%), and progressive disease (PD),
by comparing 1-dimensional measurements to the postoperative tumor size as measured in the postoperative
MRI. Criteria remained unchanged all through the
prospective cohort comparison study with protocols
HIT-GBM-A, -B, and -C.

RESULTS
Patients
The efficacy of the chemotherapeutic approach was evaluated in the 97 patients who were formally enrolled in the
prospective HIT-GBM-C trial. Furthermore, 97 patients

Cancer

enrolled in the previous cohorts, HIT-GBM-A and HITGBM-B, were used as an historical control group.
Patients in HIT-GBM-C were diagnosed between
1999 and 2003, and 57 were males. Previous malignant
diseases were 1 acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), 1
ALL followed by a PNET and then an HGG, and 1 craniopharyngioma. The median age was 9.84 years (range,
3.22-17.93). Tumor locations were as follows: spinal (2),
pons (37), mesencephalon (2), cerebellum and fourth
ventricle (4), basal ganglia and third ventricle (14), cerebral cortex and white matter (30), overlapping areas restricted to neopallial structures (3), and overlapping areas
of neopallium and other structures (5). Surgery yielded
gross total resection for 21 patients, subtotal resection for
11, and partial resection for 18; 26 patients had biopsy
only and 21 had no surgery. For the outcome analysis,
patient data were separated into pontine and nonpontine
tumors (Table 1). All patients in the pontine glioma treatment group had reference radiology, and 59 of 60 patients
with nonpontine tumors had histology reference evaluation. In the historical control group, the numbers were 37
of 49 and 47 of 48, respectively.
Toxicity
The toxicity of the chemotherapy used in HIT-GBM-C
was as expected. During the first cycle of chemotherapy,
nausea was the dominant complaint, and grade IV
(NCI-CTC 3.0) neutropenia was observed in only 15%
of patients. The second cycle, which contained ifosfamide, resulted predominantly in bone marrow toxicity
and fever, from which all patients recovered (Table 2).
The feared side effect of severe hearing loss due to adding radiation to the inner ear during treatment with cisplatin did not occur (grade III hearing loss in only 1 of
80, and 74 reported after the first and second cycle,
respectively). No toxicity deaths were reported on the
protocol. Performance status was described on a qualitative scale and showed an increase in patients confined
to the bed, from 4% after the first cycle to 13% after
the second.
Response
MRI studies 1-4 weeks after radiochemotherapy in 75 of
76 patients with residual tumors yielded the following
responses: 5 CR, 9 PR, 38 SD, and 23 PD. Early response
was more frequently observed in patients with tumors of
the pons (8 of 36, 22%) than in others (6 of 39, 15%).
Eight patients responded later, bringing the total best
response rate to (CR þ PR) to 22 of 76 (Table 3). Most
patients who started radiochemotherapy after complete

resection remained tumor free throughout the protocol
(14 of 21); 4 patients had a relapse during the first 2
cycles, and 3 had a later relapse.
Survival
The overall survival rate of all 97 patients treated
according to HIT-GBM-C was 91% (SE  3%), 56%
(5%), 30%, 23%, 22%, and 19% (4%) after 6, 12,
24, 36, 48, and 60 months, respectively. The event-free
survival (EFS) rate was 52% (5%), 27%, 16%, 15%,
13%, and 13% (4%) after the same time periods. Previously described risk factors were confirmed; patients
with pontine tumors had worse survival, and patients
with completely resected tumors had better survival than
others. The original plan of the protocol was to compare
overall survival with that of the historical control group.
Those survival rates were 53%, 13%, and 7% after 12,

708

36, and 60 months, which were slightly inferior to rates
for the treatment group. The same was true when looking at EFS (24%, 7%, 5%, and 5% after 12, 36, 48, and
60 months, respectively). However, this overall survival
comparison was conditional on a subgroup analysis,
which showed that patients with pontine tumors needed
a separate evaluation,10 and, therefore, the statistical
comparison—including the calculation of P values—was
inappropriate for the whole group. It was instead performed separately for the following subgroups.
For patients with pontine tumors, overall survival
rates did not differ between the HIT-GBM-C and the
control groups (Fig. 1). Kaplan-Meier curves crossed with
a median overall survival duration of 1.13 years (SE 
0.10 years; 95% CI, 0.87-1.39) for the treatment group
and 0.94 years (SE  0.05 years) for the control group.
The same was true when we compared EFS (median EFS,
0.40  0.07 years for the treatment group vs 0.55 
0.098 for controls). For patients with HGG outside the
pons and with residual tumor after surgery, the results
were similar. No relevant difference was detected in overall survival duration: the treatment group median survival
duration was 0.92  0.06 years (95% CI, 0.71-1.17),
compared with 1.17  0.07 years for the control group.
When EFS was considered, the treatment group had a
tendency toward an inferior outcome (median EFS of the
treatment group, 0.44  0.04 years compared with
0.67  0.06 years for controls).
Patients with completely resected tumors displayed
a different picture. The data from the historical patient
group indicated survival almost as poor as in patients with
residual tumors, with a median overall survival duration
of 1.85 years (SE  0.60; 95% CI, 0.78-4.4). In contrast,
the HIT-GBM-C treatment group, after complete resection, had an excellent outcome, and the median overall
survival was never reached (Fig. 2). After 6, 12, 24, 36,
48, and 60 months, the overall survival rates of the treatment group were 95% (5), 86% (8), 76% (9), 71%
(10), 71% (10), and 63% (12), respectively, and
rates in the historical control group were 100%, 62%
(12), 44% (12), 37% (12), 31% (12), and 17%
(10), respectively (median 1.85 years  0.6 SE; 95%
CI, 0.78 -4.42). The analysis of EFS confirmed these findings: after 6, 12, and 60 months, the EFS rates in the treatment group were 86% (8), 67% (10), and 48%
(10), respectively (median survival duration, 1.53 
0.71 years), versus 69% (12), 50% (12), and 13%
(8), respectively, in the historical control group (median, 0.65  0.25 year).

To ensure that this result was not an artifact, the
treatment and control groups of patients with completely
resected tumors were compared again with respect to the
remaining possible prognostic factors. No difference was
found in gender (11:10 male-to-female ratio in the treatment and 9:7 in the control group) or frequency of grade
IV histology (16 of 21 vs 14 of 16), and there were only
nonsignificant trends in the frequency of primary metastases (3 of 21 in treatment vs 0 of 16 in control group; P ¼

21 vs 12 of 16). In Cox multiple regression analysis, sex,

Comparison of overall survival of 21 patients treated with simultaneous radiochemotherapy followed by up to 6 cycles of
chemotherapy with cisplatin, etoposide, ifosfamide, and vincristine (treatment group, thin black line) compared with 16
patients in the historical control group (broad gray line)
treated with previous protocols HIT-GBM-A,20,21 or HIT-GBMB.24 The superior survival rate of patients in the HIT-GBM-C
protocol was confirmed by using an exploratory log-rank
test, with P ¼ .003.

complete resection, patients treated with HIT-GBM-C
had better overall survival than those in the historical control group (median survival, 3.0 vs 1.9 years; P ¼ .018 in
log-rank test and P ¼ .044 in Cox multiple regressions
with metastatic status and tumor grading as additional
variables).
Similarly, excluding patients with secondary HGG,
those with missing reference histology, or those with gliomatosis did not change the relevant finding that a chemotherapy benefit was demonstrated in patient groups who
had complete resection but not in those patients with
residual disease.

DISCUSSION
We found that survival was significantly improved for
patients with completely resected HGG (Fig. 2) when
they were treated with the HIT-GBM-C chemotherapy.
The major difference of this protocol compared with the
previous ones was the continuation of intensive chemotherapy after radiation.20-22,24 The current article focuses
on the HIT-GBM-C chemotherapy trial; a thorough dis-

710

cussion of the covariates and the heterogeneity of this
patient population was recently published.10,25 As pediatric high-grade glioma are rare, some heterogeneity within
the treated patient population has to be accepted to have
sufficient numbers of patients. Even with this, the number
of patients whose results were used in the final conclusion
are small, and the evidence is not as high as a randomized
trial with simultaneous protocol arms. However, when
such a trial is not possible, the prospective cohort comparison study reported here may be the best possible
evidence.
The chemotherapy protocol as a whole was successful. The concept of combining DNA-alkylating agents
with topoisomerase inhibitors is based on the paradigm of
inhibiting topoisomerases, which are necessary for DNA
repair.32 Our data add to the evidence that the concept is
valid. However, our results should be interpreted with
caution, as they cannot differentiate between the effects of
the chemotherapy and long-term treatment with valproic
acid, which was used in the latter part of this study.25,28
The most important finding in this study is that the
overall survival of patients with total gross tumor resection
was improved by the treatment regimen (Fig. 2), while
there was no improvement for treated patients with less
than total gross resection. Maximal efforts were undertaken10 and described in the results to assure this conclusion is not biased by inhomogeneous patient populations.
Figure 1 shows the survival curve of the 37 patients with
pontine glioma. Improvement for patients after complete
resection was also shown for other chemotherapy protocols33,34 but not for all.35 Within the same cooperative
group, the effect was historically present in the HIT-91-S
protocol33 and not in the concurrently used HIT-91-M
protocol, and the effect disappeared in the following
HIT-GBM-A and -B protocols and reappeared in the
HIT-GBM-C protocol reported here. This timeline
makes it unlikely that this finding is related to improvements in surgical or diagnostic technology. Recently supported concepts of various types of tumor stem cells in
HGG that have quite distinct biologies provide a possible
explanation: the survival of HGG patients after gross total
resection depends on the success of the treatment to eradicate any remaining tumor cells. These cells have infiltrated
the brain adjacent to the tumor and may be influenced by
reactive astrocytes. In contrast, cells in the middle of a
measurable tumor lump are exposed to high concentrations of tumor cell products.36,37 The finding that
some—but not all—treatment protocols resulted in
increased survival after complete resection indicates that

the infiltrating cells are sensitive to certain types of chemotherapy but not to others. The collective experience shows
that complete resection is an important step in treatment14,25 but so is chemotherapy, in particular after complete resection, and that resection alone is not enough.38
The HIT-GBM-C protocol was written in the mid1990s. At that time, the only regimen with proven efficacy
in randomized studies was lomustine, prednisone, and
vincristine.6 Since then, the enthusiasm for nitrosourea
drugs has decreased as knowledge of their pulmonary side
effects has increased.34,39 Temozolomide3 has since been
named the standard of care in adult HGG.11 In pediatrics,
temozolomide does not seem to be as successful,40,41 but
other dose schedules are still being explored,42 including
high-dose chemotherapy,35,43 as well as other agents..
Novel approaches such as vaccination with dendritic
cells44,45 and tumor lytic viruses29 appear particularly important for patients with less-than-completely resected
tumors.
In conclusion, these data suggest that the HITGBM-C protocol is effective for pediatric patients with
gross total resected HGG. However, residual cells in
measurable tumor after surgery appear to have a different
biology and to require other treatment approaches.
