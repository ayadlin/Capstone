ABSTRACT
DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTIs) such as 5-azacytidine (5-AZA) have
been used for treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and other malignancies.
Although inhibiting global/gene-specific DNA methylation is widely accepted as a key
mechanism behind DNMTI anti-tumor activity, other mechanisms are likely involved in
DNMTI’s action. Because telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) plays key roles in
cancer through telomere elongation and telomere lengthening-independent activities,
and TERT has been shown to confer chemo- or radio-resistance to cancer cells, we
determine whether DNMTIs affect telomere function and whether TERT/telomerase
interferes with their anti-cancer efficacy. We showed that 5-AZA induced DNA
damage and telomere dysfunction in AML cell lines by demonstrating the presence of
53-BP1 foci and the co-localization of 53-BP1 foci with telomere signals, respectively.
Telomere dysfunction was coupled with diminished TERT expression, shorter telomere
and apoptosis in 5-AZA-treated cells. However, 5-AZA treatment did not lead to
changes in the methylation status of subtelomere regions. Down-regulation of TERT
expression similarly occurred in primary leukemic cells derived from AML patients
exposed to 5-AZA. TERT over-expression significantly attenuated 5-AZA-mediated
DNA damage, telomere dysfunction and apoptosis of AML cells. Collectively, 5-AZA
mediates the down-regulation of TERT expression, and induces telomere dysfunction,
which consequently exerts an anti-tumor activity.

result in global and gene-specific hypomethylation
through which growth arrest and/or apoptosis of malignant
cells are induced. [1, 6] A typical example is the tumor
suppressor p16INK4, a gene that is frequently silent due to
its promoter methylation in oncogenesis while re-activated
by DNMTI treatment. [7] However, DNMTI-mediated
growth arrest and apoptosis of leukemic cells has recently
been shown to result from the generation of reactive
oxygen species (ROS). [8] In addition, activation-induced
cytidine deaminase was down-regulated by DNMTIs via
proteasomal degrada­
tion rather than a transcriptional
regulation, which was believed to play an important
role in DNMTI cytotoxic activities. [9] Taken together,
it remains to be defined how many downstream effectors
DNMTIs may activate or repress to achieve their anticancer efficacy. Moreover, little has been known whether

INTRODUCTION
DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) are responsible
for the addition of methyl groups to CpG sites that are most
frequently clustered in regulatory or promoter regions of
genes, and appropriate DNA methylation plays important
parts in controlling gene transcription. [1] Because the
dysregulation of DNMT expression and aberrant DNA
methylation widely occurs in human malignancies, the
strategy to inhibit DNA methylation against cancer
has been developed, and DNMT inhibi­tors (DNMTIs)
including decitabine and 5-azacitidine(5-AZA) have
been applied to the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia
(AML), myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), and other
malignancies. [1–5] It is generally believed that DNMTis

conferring DNMTI resistance to malignant cells.
Human telomeres are nucleoprotein complex
consisting of up to 15 kb TTAGGG repeat sequences and
associated proteins or shelterin proteins including TRF1,
TRF2, TPP1, POT1, TIN2 and RAP1. [10] Telomeres
form protective caps on chromosome ends and are
essential to genomic stability/integrity. [10] Progressive
attrition of telomeric DNA occurs in normal somatic
cells with each round of division and eventually cellular
telomere becomes too short (dysfunctional) to exert a
capping function. [10] Telomerase is an RNA-dependent
DNA polymerase responsible for elongating telomere and
absent in most somatic cells, consistent with telomere
shortening in these cells. In sharp contrast, telomerase is
widely activated in human malignancies including AML.
[10–12] Activation of telomerase has been shown to be
an essential step during oncogenesis, thereby stabilizing
telomere length and conferring transformed cells unlim­
ited proliferation potential. [10–14] Telomerase reverse
transcriptase (TERT) is a catalytic component of the
telomerase complex and a key determinant for controlling
telomerase activity. In addition to its canonical telomere
elongation function, TERT or telomerase has many other
biological activities. [15–21] For instance, TERT has been
observed to enhance survival, chemo-resistance, invasion
and metastasis of malignant cells independently of its
telomere lengthening function. [13, 18, 22–24]
Given the key role of TERT and telomere stabilization
in cancer development and progression, it is important to
address the effect of DNMTIs on TERT expression and
telomere function for their anti-cancer activity. Indeed, the
unique impact of DNA methylation on TERT transcription
and telomere structure has been documented. [11] Unlike
other gene promoters where their methylation silences gene
transcription or expression, the methylated TERT promoter
at certain sites is associated with the gene de-repression
and telomerase activation in malignant cells. [11, 25–30]
Published data have revealed that the effect of DNMTIs on
TERT expression in malignant cells varies dependent on
cell types. [25, 31–36] Importantly, as TERT is involved in
chemo- and radio-resistance of malignant cells, [22–24] it is
critical to elucidate whether TERT is capable of protecting
DNMTI-mediated apoptosis. Moreover, it is currently unclear
whether DNMT inhibition affects telomere function in AML
cells. The present study was designed to address all these
issues.

Both HEL and KG1A cells proliferated exponentially
when cultured in 5-AZA-free medium, while their
exposure to 5-AZA attenuated or abolished increase
in cell numbers (Figure 1). Compared to KG1A cells,
HEL cells were more sensitive to 5-AZA and their
proliferation almost completely stopped even at 0.5
μM (Figure 1A and 1C). The cell number decreased
dramatically by day 6 (144 hrs) in the presence of
1.0 μM or more of 5-AZA (Figure 1A) and only
1.5 × 105 HEL cells (less than 3% of untreated cells)
were left at 5.0 μM of 5-AZA. The trypan blue exclusion
test showed that the viability of HEL cells decreased
progressively with increased amounts of 5-AZA and
longer exposure (Figure 1B), and less than ¼ of cells
survived at 5.0 μM by day 6. Similar results were
obtained in 5-AZA-treated KG1A cells (Figure 1D). In
addition, when other AML cells (Kasumi cell line) were
incubated with 5-AZA, almost identical findings were
produced (data not shown).
To see whether the low viability of 5-AZA-treated
cells was due to apoptotic cell death, we performed
Propidium iodide (PI) staining. Flow cytometry analyses
revealed the sub-G1 cell accumulation of 5-AZA-treated
cells in time- and dose-dependent manners (Figure 1E
and 1F), demonstrating that 5-AZA induced apoptosis,
consistent with the viability assay results in the same
setting of cells.

5-AZA treatment leads to DNA damage and
telomere dysfunction in AML cells
A few of previously published studies indicate
that 5-AZA-mediated cancer cell apoptosis is associated
with DNA damage response. [37, 38] To see whether
it occurs in 5-AZA-treated AML cells, we determined
the focal formation of the checkpoint protein p53BP1,
a well-established marker for DNA damage response,
by using immunofluorescence (IF). 53BP1 foci were
readily observed in 5-AZA-treated cells (Red, Figure 2),
while rarely present in non-treated cells (Figure 2).
These results clearly showed that DNA damage response
was induced by 5-AZA in KG1A and HEL AML cells.
We further asked whether 5-AZA treatment led to
telomere dysfunction. For this purpose, we examined the
presence of dysfunctional telomere-induced foci (TIF):
co-localization of 53BP1 foci with telomere signals using
immuno-fluorescence in situ hybridization (ImmunoFISH). As shown in Figure 2, telomeres, revealed as
green signals, were readily detectable in both control and
5-AZA-treated KG1A and HEL cells, whereas red 53BP1
foci only occurred in the treated cells. The merged image
demonstrated that parts of 53BP1 foci were localized
at telomeres in cells exposed to 5-AZA (TIFs: 3.60 ±
2.16/cell) while rarely seen in non-treated cells. It is
evident from these results that 5-AZA induces telomere
dysfunction (Figure 2).

chromosome 4p and amplicons were then analysed
using Sanger sequencing (Figure 4). There were
a total of 31 CpGs in the amplified region and 25
of them were methylated in untreated HEL cells
(Figure 4). Twenty-four of the 25 methylated CpGs
remained and only one of them became unmethylated in
5-AZA (5.0 μM) treated cells (Figure 4). These results
suggest that the methylated CpGs at the subtelomeric
DNA are resistant to DNMTIs.

To probe potential mechanisms behind 5-AZAmediated telomere dysfunction, we determined telomere
length in those AML cells under study. Both KG1A and
HEL cells were incubated with 2.0 and 5.0 μM of 5-AZA
for 72 hours and then analyzed for telomere length using
FLOW FISH analysis. Compared to the non-treated cells,
both KG1A and HEL cells in the presence of 5-AZA
at 2.5  μM only exhibited slight telomere shortening,
however, significant telomere attrition was observed at
5.0 μM (Figure 3A and 3B).

5-AZA inhibits TERT expression in AML cells
The effect of DNA methylation inhibition on TERT
expression is dependent on the cell type under study.
[25, 31, 32, 35, 36] To further explore the mechanism
behind telomere shortening in 5-AZA-treated cells, we
determined whether 5-AZA inhibited TERT expression
and telomerase activity in KG1A and HEL cells. Cells
were incubated with different concentrations of 5-AZA
for 72 hours and then analyzed for their TERT mRNA
level using quantitative PCR (qPCR). As shown in
Figure 5A, TERT mRNA expression was significantly
down-regulated by 5-AZA treatment in KG1A cells in a
dose-dependent manner and remaining TERT transcripts

5-AZA does not change the methylation of
subtelomeric DNA
It was previously shown that the chromatin
structure of telomere and subtelomeric DNA
affected telomere function, whereas the methylation
status of subtelomeres substantially contributed to
chromatin configuration locally. [39, 40] We thus
examined alterations in subtelomere methylation
profiles in HEL cells. Methylation-specific PCR was
performed to amplify the subtelomeric region at

TERT over-expression attenuates telomere
shortening, telomere dysfunction, DNA damage
and apoptosis in 5-AZA-treated AML cells

were < 10% of control levels at 5.0 μM of 5-AZA (Figure
5A). Largely same results were obtained from HEL cells
in the presence of 5-AZA (Figure 5A). Consistent with the
down-regulation of TERT expression, telomerase activity
was diminished in those 5-AZA-treated cells, but with less
extent, probably due to a long half-life of the enzymatic
activity (Figure 5B). [41]
To determine whether the results obtained from
AML cell lines could be recapitulated in primary AML
cells, we further tested the 5-AZA effect on primary
leukemic cells derived from five newly diagnosed AML
patients (Table 1). Cells were incubated with 5-AZA
and TERT transcripts were then assessed. As shown in
Figure 5C, 5-AZA treatment led to the down-regulation
of TERT mRNA to different extents in leukemic cells
from all five patients.

Given all the above observations, we sought to
determine whether ectopic TERT expression was capable
of antagonizing the effect of 5-AZA. For this purpose,
we introduced a lenti-viral TERT expression vector
into HEL cells, making a TERT-over-expressed HEL
cell subline (HEL-TERT) (Figure 6A). This subline
expressed two-fold higher telomerase activity than its
parent one and TERT expression/telomerase activity was
not inhibited by 5-AZA (data not shown). The parent
control HEL cells with an empty pBMN vector (HELpBMN) and HEL-TERT cells were first treated with
5-AZA and potential differences in cell numbers, viability

these two sublines. First, more HEL-TERT cells survived

DISCUSSION

repressed, whereas the hyper-methylation of the specific
TERT promoter region is required for the gene activation
in many kinds of malignant cells. [25–30] Therefore, the
effect of DNMTIs on TERT expression is dependent on
cell type and context. Our present results show that 5-AZA
treatment led to down-regulation of TERT expression
coupled with diminished telomerase activity in KG1A
and HEL cells, indicating the methylation-dependent
TERT regulation in AML cells. It is currently unclear
how exactly 5-AZA controls TERT expression. Kitagawa
et al [31] showed that the DNMTI-mediated TERT
down-regulation resulted from diminished expression of
c-MYC, a key trans-activator of the TERT gene. It has also
been proposed that the specific methylation at the TERT
promoter region prevents putative repressors from binding
to the promoter, thereby de-repressing gene transcription.
Sufficient telomere length and appropriate levels of
telomere binding factors or shelterin proteins are required
for maintenance of telomere function. [10] Based on
our present results, 5-AZA likely leads to telomere

DNMTIs have been used for the treatment of
certain hematological malignancies including AML, but
the underlying mechanism of anti-tumor activity remains
incompletely understood. The findings presented here
demonstrate that 5-AZA inhibited TERT expression in
AML cells, shortened telomere and induced telomere
dysfunction that subsequently results in apoptotic death of
AML cells. Ectopic TERT expression partially attenuated
telomere dysfunction and apoptosis. Thus, telomere
dysfunction mediated by 5-AZA may contribute to the
anti-tumor activity of DNMTIs.
The gene promoter methylation status is intimately
associated with gene transcription. In general, promoter
hyper-methylation represses while hypo-methylation
stimulates expression of given genes. However, the TERT
promoter is very unique: widespread DNA demethylation
of the promoter occurs in human fibroblasts and other
normal cells where the TERT transcription is stringently

dysfunction via telomere attrition. We observed that TERT
mRNA down-regulation was coupled with a decline in
telomerase activity in 5-AZA-treated AML cells, which
consequently disrupts telomere length stabilization, and
triggers telomere dysfunction. Indeed, telomere shortening
was observed in AML cells incubated with 5-AZA.
Moreover, TERT over-expression prevented 5-AZAmediated telomere shortening in those cells. Despite these
supportive observations, however, TERT down-regulation
could not be the only explanation for telomere shortening
seen in 5-AZA-treated cells, because numerous studies
have demonstrated that there is a significant time-lag
between telomere shortening and cancer cell exposure to
either telomerase inhibitors or TERT inhibition. [42] In
addition, our findings are in contrast to those of previous
studies showing that DNMT inhibition promoted telomere
elongation in mouse and human cells. [39, 43] It is
currently unclear what causes such a discrepancy between
those studies. Likely, cells derived from different species
and the use of different tissue systems contribute to the
varying response to DNMT inhibition.
Alterations in chromatin structure are closely
associated with telomere structure and function.
Gonzalo et al found that DNMT depletion resulted in
demethylation of subtelomeric regions. [39, 40] We
thus hypothesized that the 5-AZA treatment might lead
to the hypomethylation of the subtelomere region in
leukemic cells in the presence of 5-AZA. Unexpectedly,
however, the methylation profile in the subtelomere of
chromosome 4p did not differ substantially between
the cells with and without 5-AZA treatment. The
implications of these seemingly contradictory results
remain to be resolved. Again, cell origin, differing
culture conditions and different approaches to DNMT
inhibition might contribute to the observed discrepancy.
Further analyses of the global DNA methylation profile
in non-treated and DNMTi-treated cells are required to
elucidate these issues.
DNA damage response was previously observed in
DNMTI-treated leukemic and cancer cells. [8, 37, 38, 44,
45] DNMTIs were shown to cause replication lesions through
which double-strand breaks of DNA, radial chromosomes
and chromatid breaks are induced. [44] Jiemjit et al found
that DNA damage also occurred in DNMT-/- cells exposed
to DNMTIs, indicating that such effect is DNMT inhibitionindependent. [37] It is currently unclear how exactly
DNMTIs trigger DNA damage. Given the fact that DNA
damage response is required for growth arrest and apoptosis
mediated by DNMTIs, [37] it is a demanding task to elucidate
the underlying mechanism. Moreover, another key issue
is whether the same DNA damage mechanism contributes
to telomere dysfunction. Because telomeric DNA damage
is irreparable, [46] cells carrying telomere dysfunction
will eventually undergo apoptosis or senescence, which
favours eradication of malignant cells and has an important
therapeutic implications.
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

TERT has been shown to possess multiple noncanonical activities in addition to its telomere lengthening
function. [13, 15–21, 47, 48] For instance, TERT is capable
of facilitating the recruitment of DNA repair factors to
sites of double-stranded breaks, [48] while depletion
of TERT leads to enhanced cell radiosensitivity, and
diminished capacity for DNA repair. [47] In accordance
with these reports, we observed that TERT over-expression
attenuated DNA damage, as demonstrated by decreased
53-BP1 foci in 5-AZA-treated leukemic cells. Because
DNA damage is required for growth arrest and apoptosis
mediated by DNMTIs, [37] it is not surprising that cell
death was attenuated in TERT over-expressed cells when
exposed to 5-AZA, likely due to accelerated DNA repair
mediated by TERT.
In the present study, we also observed that 5-AZA
inhibited TERT expression in primary leukemic cells
derived from all five AML patients. We were unable
to determine their telomere length and function, DNA
damage and apoptosis due to limited cell numbers. For the
same reason, the relationship between the sensitivity of
leukemic cells to 5-AZA and the degree of TERT downregulation could not be assessed in these primary AML
cells. These issues are clinically important and should be
addressed in further studies.
In summary, we show that the DNMT inhibitor
5-AZA down-regulates TERT expression in both AML cell
lines and primary leukemic cells, and shortens telomere
length coupled with telomere dysfunction, DNA damage
response and apoptosis. Ectopic TERT expression partially
attenuated telomere dysfunction and DNA damage, thereby
protecting AML cells from apoptosis. Conceivably, TERT
down-regulation and telomere dysfunction mediated
by 5-AZA may contribute to the anti-tumor activity
of DNMTIs. Thus, it may be worthwhile to evaluate
the therapeutic efficacy of DNMTIs on hematological
malignancies based on their induction of TERT inhibition/
telomere dysfunction in future clinical trials.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cells, cell cultures and reagents
The study included the human AML cell lines
KG1A and HEL that were grown in 10% foetal calf
serum-containing RPMI-1640 with addition of 2 mM
L-glutamine and antibiotics (50 mg/mL penicillin, and
50 mg/mL streptomycin) in a humid atmosphere at
37°C/5% CO2. The DNA methylation inhibitor 5-AZA
was bought from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, USA) and
exponentially growing cells were cultured in the presence
and absence of 5-AZA (0, 0.5, 1, 2 and 5 μM) for up
to 144 hours or 6 days. Culture medium was replaced
with freshly prepared 5-AZA-containing medium every
two days. Cells were counted for numbers and viability
determined by using trypan Blue exclusion test.

FlowCytometer (Beckman Coulter). For each sample
1 × 106 cells were measured. Data analysis was permormed
with Kaluza®Flow Analysis Software. The control gate
was set based on the negative control.

Primary AML cells were derived from five AML
patients and their clinical/molecular characteristics
are listed in Table 1. Peripheral blood was drawn into
heparinized glass tubes and leukemic cells were isolated
by Lymphoprep gradient centrifugation (Nycomed, Oslo,
Norway), and subsequently incubated in complete medium
in the absence or presence of 5-AZA as described above.
The study was approved by the Karolinska Ethics Review
Committee.

Immuno-FISH
Immuno-FISH was performed as described.
[50] Briefly, cells were harvested and cytospined onto
Superfrost plus slides (Thermo Scientific), fixed with 4%
paraformadehyde and permeabilized with Triton PBS
for 20 mins and blocked with serum free Block (DAKO,
Glostrup, Denmark). The slides were then incubated
with 53BP1 antibody (Bethyl Inc., Montgomery, Texas,
USA) followed by incubation with Alexa 594 secondary
antibody (Jackson Labs Technologies Inc., Los Gatos, CA,
USA). The slides were treated with frozen and thawed
cycle in liquid nitrogen, and incubated in 0.1N HCL for
10 mins. The PNA-telomere probe (PANAGENE Inc.,
Daejeon, Korea) was finally added. High-resolution
images were collected using Leica Confocal TCS SP5
with 488 nm and 594 nm sequential laser scan. Depth of
Z stack was taken with recommended optimization and
between-stack mode. The co-localization of 53BP1 and
telomere signals was examined and analyzed on each layer
by two separate independent persons in a double-blind
manner. The detailed protocol is available upon request.

The TERT lenti-viral vector and infection of
AML cells
A lenti-III-HA-GFP-TERT vector was constructed
and a Lenti-BMN-GFP vector (a gift from Rudbeck
Laboratory, Department of Immunology, Genetics and
Pathology of Uppsala University) was used as control.
The lentiviral vector was packaged in 293FT cells and
supernatant collected to infect HEL cells. The cells were
selected using puromycin (2 μg/ml).

RNA extraction, reverse transcription and qPCR
Total cellular RNA in cells with different treatments
was extracted using Trizol (Life Technology, Paisley,
Scotland, UK). cDNA was synthesized using random
primers (N6) (Amersham, Buckinghamshire, UK) and
M-MLV reverse transcriptase. qPCR was carried out in
an ABI7700 sequence detector (Applied Biosystems,
Foster City, CA, USA) using SYBR Green kit (Applied
Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and the specific primer
pair for TERT transcripts, as previously described. [49]
β2-microglobulin (β2-M) was PCR-amplified as an internal
control. Levels of TERTmRNA were calculated based on
the threshold values and normalization of β2-M expression.

Flow-FISH for telomere length assay
Flow FISH of AML cells was performed according
to previous protocols by Baerlocher et al [51, 52] with
minor modifications. Cells from calf thymus were
kindly donated from the butchery Ö-slakt AB (Värmdö,
Stockholm). All experiments were made with a Gallios
flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter) and analyzed using
the Kaluza software (Beckman Coulter, Caguas, PR,
USA). For quantification fluorescent MESF-FITC beads
(Bangs Laboratories, Fishers, IN, USA) were used and the
fluorescent signal was quantified using the QuickCal v.2.3
data analysis program (Bangs Laboratories).

Assessment of telomerase activity
Telomerase activity was assessed using a
commercial Telomerase PCR ELISA kit (Roche
Diagnostics Scandinavia AB, Stockholm, Sweden) as
recommended by the manufacturer. For each assay, one μg
of protein was used, and 25 PCR cycles were performed
after the telomerase-primer elongation reaction. The PCR
products were detected using ELISA color reaction and the
level of telomerase activity was expressed as absorbance
in arbitrary units.

Subtelomeric DNA methylation at chromosome 4p
Genomic DNA, extracted from control and TERTover-expressed HEL cells with or without 5-AZA,
was subject to bisulfite conversion using an EZ DNA
Methylation-Gold Kit (ZYMO RESEARCH, Irvine, CA,
USA). PCR primers specific to the subtelomere region of
chromosome 4p was used to amplify the target region. [53]
The obtained PCR products were then sequenced at both
directions. Two independent experiments were performed.

Flow cytometry analysis of cell cycle
and apoptosis
AML cells were treated with different concentrations
of 5-Azacytidine for three consecutive days as decribed
above, and then harvested for ethanol fixation and PI
staining. The PI fluorescence was measured with a

Statistics
Student’s T-test was used to compare cell numbers,
apoptotic cells, TERT mRNA levels and telomere lengths

between control and 5-AZA-treated AML cells. All the
tests were two-tailed and computed using SigmaStat3.1®
software (Systat Software, Inc., Richmond, CA, USA).
P values of < 0.05 were regarded as statistically significant.
