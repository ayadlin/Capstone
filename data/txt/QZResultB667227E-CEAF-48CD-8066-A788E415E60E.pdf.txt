BACKGROUND. Oropharyngeal mucositis (OM) causes profound impairment of
patients’ health-related quality of life (HQoL). The aim of the article is to
describe the development and preliminary validation of an HQoL instrument,
OMQoL, specifically for patients with OM.

METHODS. First, a qualitative phase was conducted to generate items (n ¼ 23).
Face validity was assessed by focus group interviews (n ¼ 13). Expert content
review (n ¼ 7) was used to ensure content validity. The second step was a quantitative validation phase comprised a multicenter study (n ¼ 210) to help identify
subscales of the instrument addressing different dimensions of OM and to mea-

RESULTS. The qualitative interview generated 171 items. Using focus group discussion and expert content review, items were reduced to 41 items. Factor and
items, depicting problems with symptoms, diet, social function, and swallowing.
The floor effect was modest. The factorial structure was satisfactory with loading
higher than 0.40 (r ¼ 0.457–0.874). The internal consistency reliability of each
subscale was high, with Cronbach alpha coefficients ranging from 0.906 to 0.934.
The test-retest reliability of the individual items using weighted kappa was good
(kappa values 0.610–0.895). The intraclass correlation results for the subscale
totals were all in excess of 0.70 (0.864–0.934).

CONCLUSIONS. An initial psychometric analysis of the OMQoL was encouraging.
The OMQoL could provide a valuable tool for the assessment of HQoL of patients
with OM. Cancer 2007;109:2590–9.  2007 American Cancer Society.

O

ropharyngeal mucositis (OM) is an acute inflammatory and ulcerative oral complication that commonly occurs during cancer
therapy. The incidence of OM reported in the literature varies
widely, with estimates ranging from 20% in patients who received
standard-dose 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)-based stomatotoxic chemotherapy for the treatment of colorectal cancer to 50% of patients being
treated with standard-dose 5-FU, Adriamycin, and cytoxan-based
stomatotoxic chemotherapy for breast cancer.1 Approximately 97%
and 89% of head and neck cancer patients receiving conventional
radiotherapy and chemoradiotherapy, respectively, will develop
OM.2 For patients subjected to high-dose myeloablative chemotherapy with or without concomitant total body irradiation before

hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), the
incidence of OM is reported to be approximately
75% to 100%.3,4
Clinically, OM presents with an initial mucosal
erythema that often progresses to patchy mucositis
and then to extensive ulceration and desquamation.5,6 In addition to the clinical and economic burdens,7–9 OM often causes substantial physical and
psychosocial suffering to patients. Pain, inability to
eat/chew, drink, swallow, or speak, compromised
oral intake and nutritional status, and colonized
infection and bleeding can have profound functional,
nutritional, and emotional impacts on patients.
These are particularly damaging to the cancer
patients’ well-being and health-related quality of life
(HQoL).7,10,11 The literature indicates that 46% of
patients with OM report 3 to 4 simultaneous OMrelated dysfunctions.12 The HQoL was severely compromised for patients with OM,11,13,14 especially in
the functional sphere.11 Patients with cancer have
always identified OM as 1 of the major troubling
symptoms and the primary cause of distress in their
cancer treatment. It is estimated that about 38% of
the patients with OM suffer from depression.14
The latest advance in OM has been the detailed
understanding of the cellular and molecular biology
of mucosal injury.6 The refined 5-stage model of OM
suggests that the most rational approach for managing OM is to use mechanistically based agents
directing at multiple pathways involved in OM
pathogenesis.15 Until recently, there has been no
scientifically demonstrated intervention or agent in
any setting to reduce the incidence and duration of
OM, and the treatment of OM was limited to palliative strategies. The most recent Cochrane systematic
review of interventions for preventing oral mucositis
evaluated 29 interventions and recruited 5217
patients. The reviewers concluded that of those 29,
only 10 interventions showed some evidence of a
benefit (albeit sometimes weak) in preventing or
reducing the severity of OM.16 In its 2005 update of
the MASCC/ISOO Clinical Practice Guidelines for
OM, the MASCC/ISOO Mucositis Study Group
recommends few agents for OM, specific to certain
cancer types or cancer treatments.17 Palifermin (recombinant human keratinocyte growth factor) is the
only pharmacologic agent approved by the US Food
and Drug Administration (FDA) for reduction of the
incidence and duration of OM in patients with hematologic malignancies undergoing autologous
HSCT. The introduction of palifermin represents an
important first in the management of OM.4,17,18 More
clinical trial efficacy data for palifermin should be
available in the next few years.

Given the multifaceted nature of OM, the evaluation of its incidence and duration does not reflect
the full impact of the oral condition on a patient.
Trials of potential therapeutic agents or interventions
should, therefore, not only include assessments of
biomedical outcomes but also HQoL parameters
because they are an integral part of efficacy studies.
Nevertheless, since its introduction HQoL has been 1
of the most debated concepts in the literature. The
debate centers around the issues of dimensionality
of the operationalized concept and the measurement
of each dimension. The majority argue that HQoL is
a subjective, multifaceted construct that encompasses perceptions of both positive and negative
aspects of dimensions such as physical symptoms
and toxicities, physical functioning, emotional functioning, role functioning and social well-being and
functioning.19–21 Because there are so many potential
dimensions, controversy remains over which components should be included. Nevertheless, most researchers agree that a number of the above
dimensions should be included in HQoL instruments
and that the HQoL is neither a unidimensional nor
bidimensional construct.21,22 There are other unifying
and noncontroversial features of the HQoL instruments: the patients themselves are asked, there are
frequently several subscales, the scales are often
based on multiple items, and the scales represent
constructs that cannot be measured directly.22
HQoL was increasingly assessed in clinical trials
of therapeutic agents or interventions for OM using
the generic measure of Functional Assessment of
Cancer Therapy-General Scale (FACT-G) as an important part of the evaluation of treatment outcome.4,18
This instrument, however, may lack sensitivity and
would be unable to discriminate differences in OM
between groups of patients. Currently, 1 of the major
barriers in the HQoL assessment of patients with OM
has been the lack of an instrument to specifically tap
dimensions of health status that are particularly salient and relevant to OM in cancer therapy. Whereas
many generic HQoL instruments, such as the FACTG19 and the European Organization for Research and
Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life QuestionnaireCore 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30),23 are available for the
assessment of HQoL in cancer patients, none sufficiently cover the aspects specifically relevant for
patients with OM. Of the published disease- or sitespecific instruments, only the EORTC Quality of
Life-Head and Neck 35 Questionnaire (EORTC QLQH&N35),24 the FACT-Head and Neck Scale (FACTH&N),25 the Quality of Life Radiation Therapy Instrument with Head and Neck Companion Module
(QOL-RTI/H&N)26 and the Performance Status Scale

2592

for Head and Neck Cancer (PSS-HN)25 contain items
related to oral dysfunction, such as swallowing and
speech. Nevertheless, they were developed for use in
patients with head and neck cancer and so focus on
the effects associated with radiotherapy and surgical
treatment of head and neck cancer: facial disfigurement and permanent impairment of vasculature,
connective tissue, salivary glands, muscle, and bone.
They may fail to fully address the distinct problems
arising from the acute erythematous and ulcerative
mucosal changes in OM during chemotherapy and
radiotherapy. Another drawback of the EORTC QLQH&N35, FACT-H&N, and QOL-RTI/H&N instruments
is that they must be used in conjunction with their
core questionnaires24–26; the whole panel of items
would be much more demanding for patients, particularly in the acute stage of complication. Indeed,
OM is a unique, acute complication very common to
stomatotoxic chemotherapy and high-dose myeloablative chemotherapy, as well as head/neck irradiation. Neither generic nor disease-specific instruments
can specifically and concisely address the important
issues in OM. These instruments may therefore not
be suitable for assessing patients with OM because
of their limitations in sensitivity and validity.
The purpose of this article is to describe the development and preliminary validation of the OMQoL,
an OM-specific HQoL measure, which is intended to
provide an accurate summary of the patient’s perspective of the impact of OM while undergoing cancer therapy.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
The study was conducted in the 2 regional university-affiliated hospitals and 1 regional hospital in
Hong Kong after approval from their Institutional
Review Boards. Subjects were recruited who were
over 18 years of age, diagnosed with hematologic
malignancies or solid tumors, able to understand the
study, and give informed consent. They were treated
with 1 of the following cancer therapies and presented with OM: stomatotoxic chemotherapy (eg, 5FU, etoposide, melphalan, Adriamycin, methotrexate,
etc), head/neck irradiation, combined chemotherapy
and head/neck irradiation, high-dose myeloablative
chemotherapy for HSCT or combined high-dose
myeloablative chemotherapy and total body irradiation for HSCT. Subjects with such cancer therapies
were selected because they are considered to be at
high risk for OM and thus are representative of the
group targeted by the developed scale. The study
was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of

Helsinki; all the subjects provided written informed
consent before enrolling in the study.
The OMQoL instrument was developed and
tested in 2 stages: first, to perform item generation;
second, to perform psychometric evaluation of the
developed scale.

Item Generation
The approach to developing the OMQoL used a combination of empirical item generation and theoretical
item selection.19 The degree to which these OMQoL
elements, including individual items, response format, and instructions, is relevant to and representative of the targeted construct for HQoL assessment
in OM patients was determined by focus group discussion and expert content review.27,28

RESULTS
Exploratory, in-depth qualitative interviews were carried out with OM patients in order to identify areas
of salience and concern, which enabled us to generate a large number of candidate questionnaire
items.29 Interviews were conducted with 23 patients
(11 male, 12 female) with a mean (SD) age of
42  13 years (range, 21–58 years). The majority of
them were diagnosed with nasopharyngeal cancer
(NPC) (n ¼ 9, 39%) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (n ¼ 7, 30%). The respondents were well
distributed with respect to cancer treatment modality: 6 (26%) were treated with stomatotoxic chemotherapy and 6 (26%) received a combination of
chemotherapy and head/neck irradiation. The majority of the respondents (n ¼ 11, 48%) had World
Health Organization (WHO) grade 2 OM during cancer therapy (Table 1). The analysis of respondent
interviews resulted in the generation of 171 items.
Three researchers went on to independently select
and devise questionnaire items from these 171 items,
which were then discussed and scrutinized for repetition and ambiguity until a final set of items was
agreed upon. To avoid possible omission of items
that could be clinically significant, recent literature
and previous validated HQoL instruments, including
the EORTC QLQ-H&N35, the FACT-H&N, and the
QOL-RTI/H&N, were also searched for additional
items.24–26 After removal of duplicate and idiosyncratic items the item selection process yielded 63
items for the first version of the OMQoL. All the
items were formulated both in English and Chinese
by a linguistics expert and 2 bilingual investigators. A
4-point Likert scale with descriptors (1 ¼ not at all,
2 ¼ a little bit, 3 ¼ quite a bit, 4 ¼ very much)
response format was selected because previous

HQoL studies indicated that this is the most appropriate scoring format for such an instrument.23,24
Focus group interviews,28 made up of a combination of OM patients and their family caregivers,
were used to assess the face validity of the OMQoL
and refine the questionnaire if necessary. Ten
patients and 6 family caregivers were enrolled in
focus group interviews. Nine patients and 4 family
caregivers actually attended the group discussions,
with 6 respondents in 1 group and 7 in another. The
mean age of the patient respondents was 38  15
years (range, 18–55 years) with 5 (56%) males. About
one-third of the respondents were diagnosed with
ALL (n ¼ 3, 33%). Patients treated with stomatotoxic
chemotherapy and high-dose myeloablative chemotherapy for HSCT represented 66% of the study sample. Patient respondents were well distributed by OM

severity, with the exception of WHO grade 4. The
mean age of the family caregiver respondents was
38  15 years (range, 22–54 years) (Table 1). In focus
group interviews respondents were asked to comment on the clarity, understandability, and appropriateness of all instructions, questionnaire items, and
response continua and to check on the most appropriate wording. Items that were problematic or not
well understood were reworded to improve comprehension. It was also possible for respondents to
exclude items or suggest additional ones. The first
author facilitated the process of group interview. After focus group discussion it was decided for reasons
of irrelevance, ambiguity, and repetition to remove
20 items and add 1. The remaining 44 items went to
expert review to assess the content validity.
Expert review for clarity and relevance was undertaken by 2 clinical oncologists (29%), a HSCT oncologist (14%), a specialist oncology nurse (14%), 2
specialist HSCT nurses (29%), and an oral mucositis
researcher (14%). The mean oncology/HSCT experience of the experts was 14.4  2.9 years (range, 9–17
years). A separate, 4-point rating scale was used to
assess the clarity and relevance parameters: 1, not
clear, not relevant; 2, somewhat clear, somewhat relevant; 3, clear, relevant; and 4, very clear, very relevant.
The interrater agreement (IR) and content validity
index (CVI) for theses 2 parameters were computed,
which have been presented elsewhere.30 The experts’
review showed 37 of the 44 items (CVI 0.82) to be ‘relevant’ and ‘very relevant.’ As a result of the content validity testing, minor revisions were made to improve
clarity and logic, which resulted in the deletion of 3
items and the modification of 4. The iteration with 41
items had a clarity IR of 0.71, a relevancy IR of 0.72, a
clarity CVI of 0.97 (range, 0.57–1), and a relevancy CVI
of 0.88 (0.71–1), which were greater than the predetermined acceptable IR and CVI levels of 0.70 and 0.80,
respectively. The resultant OMQoL contained 41
items. A single item with rating of 1–7 was also developed to assess the overall QoL during OM.22

Psychometric Evaluation
To determine the psychometric properties of the
OMQoL, the above 41-item version of the OMQoL
was administered to 210 patients with OM during
their cancer therapies to test its scaling properties,
internal consistency, and test-retest reliability using
an iterative process. The statistical analysis began
with assessment of the pattern of missing values
among the OMQoL items. In addition, the degree of
variability among individual items was assessed
using summary statistics. An exploratory factor analysis was undertaken to extract factors in order to

2594

CANCER

June 15, 2007 / Volume 109 / Number 12

explore how the items of the OMQoL were combined
into relevant subscales. For this purpose a principal
axis factoring31 with promax rotation32 was used.
Only factors that gained an eigen value in excess of 1
and items with factor loadings above 0.40 were
retained.33 The correlations of items with their subscales total were also determined. Items with a low
corrected item-total correlation (r<0.20) with the
other items were considered for deletion.33 Cronbach
alpha coefficient was used to assess the internal consistency reliability for the subscales total. Items that
tapped different aspects of the same attribute by too
low a correlation (alpha coefficient <0.70)29,34 and
showed redundancy of measurement by too high a
correlation (alpha coefficient >0.95)33 were omitted.
In addition, items were removed from each of the
subscales if they inflated the alpha coefficient.29 The
test-retest pairs for each individual item were analyzed using a weighted kappa coefficient35,36 and the
test-retest analysis of the subscale total scores was
performed using intraclass correlation (ICC).37 Values
greater than 0.40 and 0.70 for weighted kappa and
ICC, respectively, were accepted as satisfactory level
for test-retest reliabilities.35–37 Scale-level analysis
was evaluated by the floor and ceiling effects. The
floor effect refers to a high percentage of subjects
scoring the lowest possible score (not at all), whereas
ceiling effect refer to a high percentage of subjects
achieving the highest possible score (very much).38 A
percentage of 20% at floor or at ceiling was considered a significant effect. Likewise, a percentage of
70% was considered a high floor or ceiling effect,
which indicates a scale that is limited in its responsiveness to clinical change.38 In this study, items with
a high floor or ceiling effect, ie, items where more
than 70% subjects scored ‘not at all’ or ‘very much’
were considered for removal.
Table 2 describes the demographic and clinical
characteristics of the 210 patients. The mean age of
the patients was 51  12 years (range, 21–84 years)
with 120 (57%) females. Almost half of the patients
were diagnosed with NPC (n ¼ 91, 43%). One-third
of the patients were treated with stomatotoxic chemotherapy (n ¼ 76, 36%), and another 34% (n ¼ 71)
treated with combined chemotherapy and head/neck
irradiation. Patient respondents were quite well distributed by OM severity, with the exception of WHO
grade 4.
Exploratory factor analysis extracted 4 distinct
factors that included 31 items denoting symptoms
(Factor 1, items 1–9), diet (Factor 2, items 10–19),
social function (Factor 3, items 20–26), and swallowing (Factor 4, items 27–31). These 4 factors
accounted for 62.8% of the total variance. The factors

with their respective factor loadings are presented in
Table 3. The factorial structure was satisfactory, with
loading >0.40 on each subscale for all items. Item 8
had moderate loading on both Factors 1 and four;
however, this item was retained because of its clinical relevance and this item would reduce the coefficient alpha for Factor 1 if they were removed.
Internal consistency reliability of OMQoL was good.
Each of the 4 factors had a similarly high coefficient
alpha value ranging from 0.906 (Factor 4, swallowing)
to 0.934 (Factor 3, social function). All corrected
item-total correlations were higher than 0.40.
Forty-seven subjects were selected at random to
fill in the OMQoL again within 3 days in order to
assess the reliability of the OMQoL over time. The
test-retest reliability of the individual items using
weighted kappa was good (kappa values 0.610–0.800)

for 25 items, and very good for 6 items (kappa values
0.808–0.895).39 The test-retest ICC for the subscale
totals ranged from 0.864 to 0.934, which were all in
excess of 0.70 (Table 3).
Table 4 summarizes the OMQoL data at the level
of each item. All items showed a noteworthy degree
of variation. Results also showed that the proportion
of missing responses per item was low. Of 210

patients, only 11 (5%) had at least 1 missing item,
and 199 (95%) had completed data on the OMQoL.
The item most commonly left missing pertained to
the item of ‘‘I reduce outside social dining due to
mucosal discomfort.’’ All of those with missing
responses did not have outside social dining due to
reverse isolation for HSCT. The other items left missing are likely due to patients failing to follow the

possible score) was shown for 25 out of 31 items. In
contrast, only 4 out of 31 items had a ceiling effect
(>20% of scores at the highest possible score). A
high floor effect (>70% of scores at the lowest possible score) was evident for item 22. However, this
item was retained because of its clinical relevance. A
high ceiling effect (>70% of scores at the highest

DISCUSSION
OM is a multifaceted clinical problem causing profound psychological distress and impairment of
HQoL for patients with cancer. Whereas the measurement of HQoL in this patient population is
increasingly being recognized as an important part

of the evaluation of treatment outcome, systematic
attempts to assess the impact of OM from the perspective of the patient have been relatively scarce
and have utilized generic or disease-specific measures.4,18 However, there are a number of aspects of
OM that are not addressed by these HQoL measures.
Problems and symptoms such as burning, bleeding,
and difficulty in swallowing saliva are not addressed
by the existing measures, even though they can have
a major clinical impact on patients with OM. In
addition, none of these measures can thoroughly
address the levels of distress caused by these symptoms or many aspects of the impact on the HQoL
resulting from acute mucosal damage. Thus, these
measures for accurately assessing the HQoL related
to OM would have limited utility.
The OMQoL developed in this study addresses
those experiences judged to be of great importance

New Measure of OMQoL/Cheng et al.

to patients with OM. Content validity was addressed
by developing items on the basis of in-depth qualitative interviews, focus groups, and expert content
review. This patient-as-expert method of item generation fulfills a basic requirement of HQoL instruments, in which the content should be generated
from relevant patients.19,40 The expert content review
revealed a high degree of agreement between 7
experts in terms of clarity and relevancy, indicating
that the items were representative of OM-related
HQoL, thereby revealing the content validity of the
OMQoL. Content validity is a fundamental requirement of all assessment instruments.41 Fayers and
Machin22 and Haynes et al.27 also indicated that
these initial stages of instrument development are
the most crucial and are what distinguishes successful from unsuccessful instruments, and no amount
of psychometric analyses can recover a poorly conceived questionnaire.
The OMQoL is designed to assess all specific
aspects of the HQoL that tap dimensions of health
status of particular salience to patients with OM. Our
factor analysis supported the creation of symptoms,
diet, social function, and swallowing subscales. Such
dimensions of OMQoL are distinctive and of special
importance in OM. The OMQoL subscales had a
high degree of internal consistency, confirming its
reliability. In addition, the test-retest reliabilities were
good, meeting all weighted kappa and ICC coefficient
requirements.35–37 The symptoms scale consists of 9
items that assess various symptoms, such as pain,
edema, burning, and bleeding in relation to OM. The
diet scale includes 10 items that assess different
degrees of dietary and eating problems. The social
function scale includes 7 items that assesses problems with communicating to other people and
assesses embarrassment at mealtimes with family
and friends. The swallowing scale consists of 5 items
related to swallowing problems. It is interesting to
note that items 12 and 27, pertaining to sticky saliva
and throat discomfort, respectively, may assess the
aspects of symptoms and thus may be in the symptom subscale. On the basis of psychometric theory,
we decided to retain these items in the diet and
swallowing subscales, respectively. Nevertheless, for
item of sticky saliva, patients may have eating problems if they have sticky saliva. For item of throat
discomfort, patients may have swallowing problems
if they report discomfort in the throat. It could be
argued that item 12, ‘‘My saliva becomes thick/sticky
and need to spit out frequently’’ is indeed a doublebarreled question addressing the problems of diet
and symptom at the same time. However, clinical experience and content validation suggest that there is

2597

a close correspondence between thick/sticky saliva
and the need to spit frequently; thus, shared variance
is to be expected. This interpretation is supported by
sufficient variation among response categories of this
item. In addition, none of the subjects in this sample
found it confusing or difficult to answer this item.
The floor effect of the sample was modest,
whereas the ceiling effect was negligible. One possible explanation for the floor effect is that about onethird of subjects in this sample had WHO grade 1
OM, who would be expected to score at floor. Nevertheless, the sample size for the WHO grade 4 group
was small, and thus the results should be interpreted
with caution. Further evaluation of the floor and ceiling effects including a larger population with severe
OM is warranted. In addition, further research using
item response analysis investigating the performance
of individual item response choices should be
conducted.
Chemotherapy and head/neck irradiation often
cause substantial injury to the epithelial lining of the
oral mucosa. Patients with OM are a heterogeneous
group of the population affected by cancer therapy.
The OMQoL is designed to address problems experienced over the whole spectrum of cancer treatment
modalities. Although patients were not well distributed by the type of cancer therapy for psychometric
evaluation, the study sample represented the full
diversity of patients with OM. Nevertheless, it could
be argued that a possible bias was present in the
item generation and validation phases due to
younger patients being overrepresented in the samples. Although we cannot rule out that possible bias,
in future studies an attempt should be made to
determine if the OMQoL behaves differently across
age based on differential item functioning. In addition, a further validation study with a larger sample
of patients with high-dose myeloablative chemotherapy and total body irradiation followed by HSCT is
warranted.
The OMQoL was developed as a self-report measure of the multidimensional construct of OMrelated HQoL. HQoL instruments have been shown
to have the ability to assess treatment outcomes and
predict clinical outcomes. Clinical trials of efficacy
should be conducted to evaluate OM using both
objective and patient-reported HQoL data; the
OMQoL could be crucial to such assessments. The
OMQoL is the first patient-based outcome measure
that is specific to OM; this could allow evaluation of
new drugs and interventions from the patient’s
perspective and thus help map avenues for effective
OM intervention. In addition, the OMQoL will provide a unique and common platform for clinicians to

2598

CANCER

assess, care for, and treat patients with OM. Stiff
et al.18 indicated that the patient’s perspective, in
conjunction with observer-rated clinical scales, is
crucial when assessing the patient’s condition and
determining a therapeutic agent’s effectiveness in the
management of OM. A patient-rated appraisal of the
effect on HQoL is also an important aspect of the
cost/benefit ratio in cost-effectiveness studies.19

Conclusions
These initial validation results of OMQoL appear promising. Further validation is ongoing to assess the
construct validity of OMQoL in relation to clinical
and other health outcomes, as well as responsiveness
to change. Nevertheless, instrument development
and validation is by no means a 1-time event.42 Additional research is needed in order to determine the
item response, sensitivity, usefulness, and psychometric robustness of OMQoL that will allow more
reliably assessing the HQoL for patients with OM.
Knowledge of minimal clinically important differences in HQoL are important for interpreting the
meaning of the HQoL results.38 Further research
determining minimal important difference for the
OMQoL is therefore warranted.
