BACKGROUND: Preliminary data suggest a potential decreased benefit of docetaxel in patients with metastatic, castration-resistant
prostate cancer (mCRPC) who previously received abiraterone acetate, a novel androgen synthesis inhibitor (ASI). Cancer and Leukemia
Group B (CALGB) trial 90401 (Alliance), a phase 3 trial in patients with mCRPC who received docetaxel-based chemotherapy, offered
the opportunity to evaluate effect of prior ketoconazole, an earlier generation ASI, on clinical outcomes after docetaxel. METHODS: In
CALGB trial 90401, 1050 men with chemotherapy-naive mCRPC were randomized to receive treatment with docetaxel and prednisone that included either bevacizumab or placebo. In total, 1005 men (96%) had data available regarding prior ketoconazole therapy.

Taxotere After Ketoconazole in mCRPC/Aggarwal et al

The observed effects of prior ketoconazole on overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), prostate-specific antigen (PSA)
decline, and the objective response rate (ORR) were assessed using proportional hazards and Poisson regression methods adjusted
for validated prognostic factors and treatment arm. RESULTS: Baseline characteristics between patients who did (N 5 277) and did
not (N 5 728) receive prior ketoconazole therapy were similar. There were no statistically significant differences between patients who
did and those who did not receive prior ketoconazole therapy with respect to OS (median OS, 21.1 months vs 22.3 months, respectively; stratified log-rank P 5.635), PFS (median PFS, 8.1 months vs 8.6 months, respectively; stratified log-rank P 5.342), the proportion achieving a decline 50% in PSA (61% vs 66%, respectively; relative risk, 1.09; adjusted P 5.129), or ORR (39% vs 43%,
respectively; relative risk, 1.11; adjusted P 5.366). CONCLUSIONS: As measured by OS, PFS, PSA, and the ORR, there was no evidence
that prior treatment with ketoconazole had an impact on the clinical outcomes of patients with mCRPC who received subsequent
docetaxel-based therapy. The current results highlight the need for prospective studies to assess for potential cross-resistance with

INTRODUCTION
Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancerrelated mortality among men in the United States.1
Although a significant number of men with advanced disease eventually die of metastatic, castrate-resistant prostate
cancer (mCRPC), the past decade has borne witness to
multiple agents with various mechanisms of action that
have demonstrated an improvement in overall survival
(OS) in randomized phase 3, placebo-controlled, clinical
trials. Among these agents are taxane-based cytotoxic
chemotherapy2-4; androgen synthesis inhibitors (ASIs),
such as abiraterone acetate5,6; and the androgen receptor
(AR) antagonist enzalutamide (MDV3100).7,8 Optimizing the sequence (or combinations) of therapy, assessing
for evidence of acquired cross-resistance, and discovering
mechanisms of treatment resistance have become of
increasing clinical importance in the treatment of patients
with mCRPC.
A retrospective, single-institution series suggested
that patients with mCRPC who receive adrenal ASIs like
abiraterone acetate may acquire cross-resistance to subsequent taxane-based chemotherapy.9 The putative biologic
mechanism explaining this cross-resistance stems from the
observation that taxanes exert their antineoplastic effect
on prostate cancer in part by down-regulating signaling
through the AR pathway. Taxanes exert this effect by targeting the AR association with tubulin, inhibiting AR nuclear translocation, and down-regulating AR-mediated
gene expression.10 Thus, it is hypothesized that prior exposure to agents targeting the androgen axis, such as abiraterone acetate, may shift the tumor phenotype toward a
more “androgen-insensitive” disease state that is partially
resistant to further inhibition of androgen signaling with
taxane-based chemotherapy.
Abiraterone acetate has only recently been approved
in mCRPC by the US Food and Drug Administration for
use in both the predocetaxel and postdocetaxel setting.

Ketoconazole is a generic, widely available ASI that has
been in clinical use for mCRPC since the 1990s. Ketoconazole blocks androgen synthesis by the inhibition of several enzymes within the androgen synthetic pathway,
including side chain cleavase, which converts cholesterol
to pregnenolone, and cytochrome P-45017 a (CYP17),
which converts pregnenolone to the androgen dehydroepiandrostenedione (DHEA) through 2 enzymatic steps
and is the same enzyme targeted by abiraterone.11-14
Ketoconazole has demonstrated significant clinical activity in mCRPC in several prior prospective clinical trials
and is a standard treatment option in this disease setting.15,16 The Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB),
now a part of the Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology,
designed CALGB 90401, a randomized phase 3 trial in
which 1050 patients with mCRPC received docetaxelbased chemotherapy. This trial offered the opportunity to
evaluate the effect of prior treatment with ketoconazole,
an earlier generation ASI, on clinical outcomes after docetaxel treatment.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Design and Hypothesis

A retrospective analysis was undertaken of data collected
from the intergroup study CALGB 90401, a randomized,
placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial of docetaxel and prednisone with or without bevacizumab in men with
mCRPC.17 The objective was to assess whether prior
androgen synthesis inhibition with ketoconazole
impacted clinical outcomes with subsequent docetaxelbased chemotherapy as a means of further investigating
the potential for acquired cross-resistance between these
therapeutic approaches for men with mCRPC.
Study Population

The eligibility requirements for CALGB 90401 were
described previously.17 In brief, eligible patients had

metastatic prostate cancer with disease progression in the
setting of a castrate level of serum testosterone (50
ng=dL) and after antiandrogen withdrawal, as defined by
Prostate-Specific Antigen Working Group 1 consensus
criteria.18 Patients were required to be 4 weeks from discontinuation of secondary hormone therapies, including
ketoconazole or antiandrogens. Patients were required to
discontinue 5-a reductase inhibitors at any time before
study entry. Prior bisphosphonate use was allowed provided that the dose was stable for >4 weeks before protocol therapy (denosumab was not commercially available at
the time). Key exclusion criteria included prior chemotherapy or antiangiogenic therapy, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status >2,
uncontrolled hypertension, congestive heart failure (New
York Heart Association class II, III, or IV), an arterial
thromboembolic event within 12 months of study entry,
or grade 2 peripheral neuropathy.
CALGB 90401 Study Design and Treatment

Patients enrolled onto CALGB 90401 were randomized
with equal probability to receive docetaxel=prednisone
plus placebo or docetaxel=prednisone plus bevacizumab.17 Randomization was stratified by: age (<65 years
or 65 years), predicted 24-month survival probability
using a validated nomogram for castrate-resistant prostate
cancer (CRPC)19 (<0%, 10%-29.9%, or 30%), and
prior history of arterial thromboembolic events (yes or
no). Treatment was continued until patients developed
either disease progression or unacceptable toxicity for a
maximum of 2 years. Patients were assessed by serum
prostate-specific antigen (PSA) measurement with each
cycle of therapy and by bone scans and computed tomography scans of the abdomen=pelvis every 3 months. The
primary endpoint was OS; and, as previously reported,
no difference between treatment arms was detected.17 In
total, 1050 patients were accrued between May 2005 and
December 2007 across 310 investigational sites within
the United States. CALGB 90401 was approved by the
local ethics committees of all participating centers. Each
participant signed an institutional review boardapproved, protocol-specific informed consent in accordance with federal and institutional guidelines.
Members of the CALGB Audit Committee visit all
participating institutions at least once every 3 years to
review source documents as part of the CALGB qualityassurance program. The auditors verify compliance with
federal regulations and protocol requirements, including
those pertaining to eligibility, treatment, adverse events,
tumor response, and outcome, in a sample of protocols at
3638

each institution. Such on-site review of medical records
was performed for a subgroup of 141 patients (13%) of
the 1050 patients under this study.
Statistical Methods and Data Analysis

The primary endpoint was OS, which was defined as the
time interval from the date of randomization to the date of
death from any cause. In addition, the effect of prior ketoconazole use on other endpoints, including progression-free
survival (PFS), a PSA decline 50% from baseline, and
the objective response proportion (defined according to
Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST]
version 1.0), was evaluated. PFS was calculated from the
date of randomization to the date of either progression or
death from any cause, whichever occurred first. Progression
was defined using PSA Working Group 1 criteria,18 with
the exception that more than 2 new bone lesions were
required to define bone progression on a bone scan.
Information about prior ketoconazole use was collected prospectively at the time of study entry, before randomization; however, data on duration of prior
ketoconazole use, whether ketoconazole was used in the
hormone-sensitive or castration-resistant setting, or prior
response to ketoconazole were not collected prospectively
on this trial. The Kaplan-Meier product-limit approach20
was used to estimate the OS and PFS distribution as a
function of prior ketoconazole use. A proportional hazards model21 was used to assess the prognostic significance of prior ketoconazole use in predicting OS and
PFS, adjusting for the prospectively defined stratification
factors and for the PFS endpoint, the treatment arm
(which a previous report indicated had an effect on PFS,
but not on OS). The Poisson regression method22 was
used to assess the prognostic significance of prior ketoconazole use in predicting the probability of a decline
50% in serum PSA from baseline and the probability of
experiencing an objective response, as defined by RECIST
1.0 criteria, adjusting for the stratification factors and
treatment arm.23 Tests of a treatment arm by prior ketoconazole use interaction in predicting outcomes on docetaxel were performed, and no significant interactions
between treatment arms were noted in predicting clinical
outcomes. Data collection and analysis were undertaken
by the Alliance (formerly CALGB) Statistical and Data
Center. The date of data cutoff was January 13, 2013.
S-plus statistical software (TIBCO Spotfire S1 version 8.1; TIBCO Spotfire Inc., Somerville, Mass) was
used for the data analyses, and all statistical tests were
2-sided. No adjustment was made for multiple comparisons for this retrospective analysis.

RESULTS
Patient Disposition and Baseline
Characteristics

In total, 1050 patients were randomized to receive
docetaxel plus prednisone with or without bevacizumab. Of these 1050 patients, 1005 (96%) had data
available regarding prior ketoconazole use (Fig. 1). The
baseline characteristics of these 1005 patients, including
known prognostic factors in mCRPC, are summarized
in Table 1. Not surprisingly, the 4% of patients for
whom data were not available with regard to prior
ketoconazole use had demographic and baseline patient
characteristics similar to those of the 96% of patients
who had data available. Of the 1005 patients who
were available for this analysis, 28% had received prior
treatment with ketoconazole for CRPC. The 2 groups
(those who had and had not received prior ketoconazole) had similar baseline characteristics, including age,
Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, median alkaline phosphatase and hemoglobin levels, and the presence of visceral metastases. There were
numeric differences between groups in the median
baseline serum PSA and lactate dehydrogenase levels,
which were higher in the group that had received prior
ketoconazole therapy. However, the 2 groups had a

validated prognostic model in CRPC, which included
PSA and lactate dehydrogenase levels among its 7 factors.19 The median baseline serum testosterone levels
and study arm assignment between patients who had
and had not received prior ketoconazole therapy were
similar.
Impact of Prior Ketoconazole Therapy
on Clinical Outcomes

In total, 968 deaths were observed, and the median
follow-up for the patients who remained alive was 57
months (95% confidence interval [CI], 52.3-59.7
months). The median OS on CALGB 90401 was 21.1
months (95% CI, 19.6-23.8 months) for those who had
received prior ketoconazole and 22.3 months (95% CI,
21.1-24.0 months) for those who had not received prior
ketoconazole (P 5 .315). The Kaplan-Meier OS curves
are depicted in Figure 2A. Adjusting for the stratification
factors, the hazard ratio for death among patients who had
received prior ketoconazole was 1.04 compared with
patients who had not received prior ketoconazole (95%
CI, 0.89-1.20; P 5 .635).
Similar results were obtained for PFS. The median
PFS for patients who had received prior ketoconazole was

(95% CI, 8.0-9.1 months) for those who had not received
prior ketoconazole (P 5 .177). Using a proportional hazards model adjusted for treatment arm and the stratification factors, the hazard ratio for PFS among the patients
who had received prior ketoconazole was 1.07 compared
with the patients who had not received prior ketoconazole
(95% CI, 0.92-1.23; P 5 .342). The Kaplan-Meier PFS
curves are provided in Figure 2B.
Additional analyses were carried out examining the
impact of prior ketoconazole therapy on the objective
response rate (among the patients who had measurable
disease at baseline) according to RECIST 1.0 criteria as
well as the proportion of patients with a decline 50% in
PSA from baseline on docetaxel-based chemotherapy.
There was no significant effect of prior receipt of
ketoconazole on the objective response rate or of
PSA declines 50% from baseline with docetaxel-based
therapy (Table 2).

DISCUSSION
The current analysis suggests that prior exposure to the
ASI ketoconazole does not impact clinical outcomes on
docetaxel-based therapy in a large cohort of patients
with mCRPC, as measured by overall and progressionfree survival, objective response rate, and PSA decline
50% from baseline. The study results provide no evidence of cross-resistance between androgen synthesis
inhibition and taxane-based chemotherapy in patients
with mCRPC. Although the use of ketoconazole in
current clinical practice has declined significantly with
the introduction of agents such as abiraterone and
enzalutamide, the current results may have implications
for the sequencing of contemporary ASIs before
taxane-based chemotherapy in mCRPC, including abiraterone acetate and others in clinical development (ie,
orteronel, galeterone). These newer agents share a
mechanism of action similar to that of ketoconazole
with respect to inhibiting adrenal androgen production,

a key source of ligand for the AR in the castrateresistant state.24
Two retrospective series of patients who received
abiraterone followed by docetaxel recently have been
reported.9,25 In one series of 35 patients who received
docetaxel after disease progression on abiraterone, 25.7%

(95% CI, 12.5%-43.3%) had a PSA decline 50%. The
median time to PSA progression and OS were 4.6 months
(95% CI, 4.2-5.9 months) and 12.5 months (95% CI,
10.6-19.4 months), respectively, outcomes that seemingly
are inferior to those achieved in the registrational phase 3
trials of docetaxel in mCRPC.2,3 In contrast, in another
small, retrospective case series of 14 patients who received
docetaxel after disease progression on abiraterone, 43% of
patients achieved a decline in serum PSA 50% from
baseline, and the median time to progression on docetaxel
(4.3 months) was qualitatively similar to that achieved on
prior abiraterone therapy (4.8 months).25
Those retrospective analyses are intriguing. However, caution in their interpretation is warranted, given
the small sample sizes, the lack of comparator arms, and
the potential for selection bias, because docetaxel therapy
was chosen according to the discretion of the individual
treating physician in both series. In the current analysis,
the large numbers of patients (1005 of the 1050 patients
enrolled on CALGB 90401), the similar distribution in
baseline prognostic factors among men with and without
prior ketoconazole exposure, and the prospectively
assessed outcomes on docetaxel-based chemotherapy all
provide support to the hypothesis that androgen synthesis
inhibition does not have a detrimental impact on subsequent taxane-based chemotherapy.
However, there are several limitations to the current
results. First, it is not known whether the potency of prior
androgen synthesis inhibition may influence clinical outcomes with subsequent taxane-based chemotherapy. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that ketoconazole is a
less potent ASI compared with abiraterone acetate, which
selectively targets the CYP17 enzyme.24 In contrast to
abiraterone, ketoconazole has not demonstrated an OS
benefit in the CRPC disease setting.16 It is not known
whether more potent androgen synthesis inhibition will
result in the emergence of cross-resistance to subsequent
taxane-based chemotherapy.

Second, these results may have been confounded by
a heterogeneous study population with respect to duration
of prior ketoconazole therapy, whether ketoconazole was
applied in the hormone-sensitive or castration-resistant
setting, and reason for discontinuation of ketoconazole,
none of which were captured prospectively on CALGB
90401 and may influence patterns of cross-resistance. It is
possible that many patients received other secondary hormone agents before study enrollment, which may have
influenced subsequent clinical outcomes with ketoconazole and=or docetaxel-based chemotherapy. Duration of
and response to secondary hormone maneuvers like ketoconazole therapy may provide a clinical measure of
“androgen sensitivity,” which could potentially influence
treatment outcomes with subsequent docetaxel therapy.
Although the current results suggest the lack of a deleterious effect from prior androgen synthesis inhibition
on the efficacy of docetaxel-based chemotherapy, this
does not rule out the possibility of cross-resistance and
ultimately highlights the need for future studies addressing the sequencing of therapy in mCRPC. Prospective
clinical trials designed with adequate statistical power will
be needed to test for potential cross-resistance between
various modalities of therapy and to define the optimal
sequence of therapy in mCRPC.
Conclusions

As measured by OS, PFS, objective response rate, and a
decline 50% in PSA, there is no evidence that prior
treatment with the androgen synthesis inhibitor ketoconazole has an impact on clinical outcomes in patients with
mCRPC who receive subsequent docetaxel therapy.
Future prospectively designed studies are needed to further assess for potential cross-resistance between novel
androgen synthesis inhibitors like abiraterone acetate and
taxane-based chemotherapy and to define the optimal
sequence of therapy as additional agents become available
for clinical use in mCRPC.
