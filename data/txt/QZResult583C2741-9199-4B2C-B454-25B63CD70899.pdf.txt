ABSTRACT
CLL is a disease characterized by chromosomal deletions, acquired copy number
changes and aneuploidy. Recent studies have shown that overexpression of Heat
Shock Factor (HSF) 1 in aneuploid tumor cells can overcome deficiencies in heat
shock protein (HSP) 90-mediated protein folding and restore protein homeostasis.
Interestingly, several independent studies have demonstrated that HSF1 expression
and activity also affects the chaperoning of HSP90 kinase clients, although the
mechanism underlying this observation is unclear. Here, we determined how HSF1
regulates HSP90 function using CLL as a model system. We report that HSF1 is
overexpressed in CLL and treatment with triptolide (a small molecule inhibitor of
HSF1) induces apoptosis in cultured and primary CLL B-cells. We demonstrate that
knockdown of HSF1 or its inhibition with triptolide results in the reduced association
of HSP90 with its kinase co-chaperone cell division cycle 37 (CDC37), leading to the
partial depletion of HSP90 client kinases, Bruton’s Tyrosine Kinase (BTK), c-RAF and
cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4). Treatment with triptolide or HSF1 knockdown
disrupts the cytosolic complex between HSF1, p97, HSP90 and the HSP90 deacetylaseHistone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6). Consequently, HSF1 inhibition results in HSP90
acetylation and abrogation of its chaperone function. Finally, tail vein injection of Mec1 cells into Rag2-/-IL2Rγc-/- mice followed by treatment with minnelide (a pro-drug
of triptolide), reduced leukemia, increased survival and attenuated HSP90-dependent
survival signaling in vivo. In conclusion, our study provides a strong rationale to
target HSF1 and test the activity of minnelide against human CLL.

chromosomal deletions or gains and single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) [4]. Given the fact that aneuploidy
and the resulting non-stoichiometric amounts of cellular
proteins impair HSP90 function, we hypothesized that
protein homeostatic mechanisms in aneuploid CLL are
likely to be deregulated [5, 6].
A recent study has reported that overexpression
of Heat Shock Factor 1 (HSF1) restores the ability of
aneuploid cells to maintain protein homeostasis [6, 7].

INTRODUCTION
Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) is the most
common adult leukemia in the western hemisphere [1, 2].
While, novel therapies including treatment with ibrutinib,
a Bruton’s Tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor, result in
durable remissions in CLL, a proportion of patients still
develop resistance to therapy [3]. CLL is characterized
by the acquisition of one or more acquired or inherited

HSF1, a stress-inducible transcription factor, exists
in a repressive complex comprising HSP90, HDAC6
and p97 (a segregase with ATPase activity) [8]. Heat
shock, accumulation of misfolded proteins, or malignant
transformation, results in the dissociation of HSF1 from
the repressive complex. Activated HSF1 up-regulates the
transcription of HSPs, which ameliorate misfolded proteininduced proteotoxic stress. HSF1-induced heat shock
proteins (HSPs) promote survival of cancer cells following
exposure to chemotherapeutic agents and have been
implicated in conferring resistance to chemotherapy as well
as promotion of tumor growth and metastasis [9–11].
HSP90 and its associated co-chaperones (HSP70,
CDC37, p23, AHSA1, etc) maintain protein homeostasis
in all cells by promoting the folding and maturation of
meta-stable HSP90 client proteins [12]. The HSP90
co-chaperone, HSP70 promotes the proteasomal
degradation of misfolded HSP90 client proteins, thereby
facilitating their disposal. Consequently, agents that promote
proteotoxic stress such as HSP90 inhibitors preferentially
target tumor cells, which are typically “addicted” to HSP90
chaperone function [13, 14]. Furthermore, several kinase
oncoproteins (BCR-ABL, NPM-ALK) and survival kinases
(c-RAF, CDK4, BTK) are chaperoned by the HSP90CDC37 complex [15–18]. Consequently, tumor cells can be
selectively targeted by inhibiting HSP90-CDC37 interaction
or down-regulation of CDC37 [18–20]. CD19+ CLL B
cells, in particular, are dependent on HSP90-dependent
kinases such as BTK, zeta-chain associated protein kinase
70 kDa (ZAP70) and AKT, among several others, for their
survival and proliferation [21, 22]
Triptolide, a small molecule inhibitor of HSF1,
is a diterpenoid epoxide isolated from the Chinese herb
Tripterygium wilfordii. Triptolide and its derivatives
have demonstrated anti-cancer activity against several
pre-clinical models of pancreatic cancer, ovarian cancer,
breast cancer, acute myeloid leukemia, multiple myeloma
and osteosarcoma [23–27]. Treatment with triptolide
results in the transcriptional inhibition of HSP70 mRNA
and the upregulation of miR-142-3p, a microRNA that
downregulates HSP70 mRNA levels. Several alternative
mechanisms of triptolide action have been described
including activation TRAIL-induced death receptor
pathway, induction endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress
and inhibition SP-1 transcriptional activity as well as
NF-kappa B activity [28–31]. A water-soluble pro-drug of
triptolide called minnelide has shown demonstrable preclinical activity against pancreatic cancer, ovarian cancer,
osteosarcoma and hepatocellular carcinoma [25, 26].
Currently minnelide is being evaluated in a phase 1
clinical trial (NCT01927965) against advanced human
gastrointestinal tumors.
Considering the fact that HSF1 overexpression
promotes HSP90 chaperone function in aneuploid cancer
cells and the fact that CLL is characterized by one or more

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

chromosomal abnormalities, we determined whether
HSF1 is overexpressed in CLL [4, 32, 33]. We report the
overexpression of HSF1 in CLL and demonstrate that
inhibition of HSF1 function with triptolide results in a
dose-dependent increase in apoptosis of CLL cells. It has
been reported that HSF1 deletion impairs the chaperoning
of numerous HSP90 kinase client proteins including
c-RAF, AKT and MIF (macrophage migration inhibitory
factor) [34, 35]. However, it has not been clear how HSF1
mechanistically inhibits HSP90 chaperone function. Here,
we demonstrate that triptolide inhibits HSP90-CDC37
binding and induces acetylation of HSP90. Consequently,
treatment with triptolide (in vitro) or minnelide (in vivo)
disrupts HSP90 chaperone function and BTK-PLC-γ2
signaling. Collectively, our findings suggest that HSF1
promotes tumorigenesis at least in part by affecting
HSP90-dependent B-cell survival signaling in CLL.

RESULTS
HSF1 is overexpressed in CLL
Consistent with the upregulation of HSPs in cancer
cells and CLL, both cultured and primary CLL B cells
showed increased expression of HSF1 and the heat shock
proteins HSP90, HSP70 and HSP40 compared to normal
B cells (Figures 1A & 1B) [36]. The relative expression
of HSF1 was significantly higher in CD19+ CLL B cells
(n = 15) compared to normal B cells (n = 7) p = 0.0003
(Figure 1A, lower panel and supplementary Figure 1).
The increased expression of HSF1 also correlated with
an increase in the levels of HSPs in cultured and primary
CLL B cells (Figure 1B). The expression of HSP27
varied widely with no clear evidence of overexpression
in all CLL samples tested (data not shown). Evaluation
of the localization of HSF1 by fractionation of cellular
proteins into nuclear and cytosolic fractions revealed that
a fraction of HSF1 (8–10%) is nuclear in CLL B cells
as compared to a pre-dominant cytosolic localization of
HSF1 in normal B cells (Figure 1C). These findings were
also confirmed by confocal immunofluorescent staining to
determine the localization of HSF1 in normal and CLL
samples. Interestingly, HSF1 was localized in the nucleus
of CLL patients stratified as low risk (indolent disease or
requiring no treatment, CLL#1) or high risk (relapsed/
refractory disease or requiring treatment, CLL#2 and
CLL#3) (Figure 1D). Collectively, these observations
suggest that HSF1 is overexpressed in CLL B cells.

Treatment with triptolide induces apoptosis in
cultured and primary CLL cells
Having observed that HSF1 is overexpressed in
CLL B cells, we next asked whether we could target
HSF1 in CLL. Treatment of CD19+ B cells with

Triptolide disrupts the association of HSP90 with
CDC37 and results in the partial depletion of its
kinase clients

triptolide, a small molecule inhibitor of HSF1 function,
induced a dose-dependent increase in apoptosis
in cultured and primary CLL cells. Triptolide was
selectively toxic to both high risk (n = 5) and low risk
CLL (n = 12) B cells (10 to 50 nM range) while largely
sparing normal B-cells (n = 5) (Figure 2A and 2B).
Consistent with the inhibition of heat-shock induced
HSP transcription, treatment with triptolide attenuated
heat-shock induced expression of HSPs (Supplementary
Figure 2A). As noted previously in multiple myeloma
and glioma, CLL cells accumulated in the G0-G1 phase
of the cell cycle cell following triptolide treatment
(Figure 2C) [37]. Finally, treatment with triptolide
resulted in the depletion of HSP70 and the induction
of Caspase-3 cleavage and PARP cleavage in cultured
and primary CLL cells (Figure 2D and supplementary
Figure 2B). These observations suggest that HSF1
inhibition has selective anti-CLL activity.

Several studies have reported that genetic deletion
of HSF1 results in reduced association of HSP90 with its
kinase client proteins [34, 35]. However, the molecular
basis of this observation has not been elucidated. Owing
to the fact that most HSP90 kinase clients require the
association of the co-chaperone CDC37 with HSP90
to promote their maturation, we determined whether
triptolide affects the interaction of HSP90 with CDC37
[38]. Immunoprecipitation of CDC37 from triptolidetreated CLL cells revealed that triptolide treatment
resulted in decreased association of HSP90 with CDC37.
This was associated with the reduced interaction of
CDC37 with HSP90 kinase clients BTK, c-RAF and
CDK4 (Figure 3A). These findings were associated with

no significant changes in the levels of CDC37, AHSA1 (an
activator of HSP90 ATPase activity) or total HSP90 in the
total cell lysates obtained from triptolide-treated Mec-1
and WaC3-CD5+ cells (Figure 3A bottom panel) [38].
In order to further corroborate our in vitro binding
studies, we performed molecular docking of triptolide
with the available crystal structure of HSP90-CDC37
[39]. Our studies revealed that consistent with the
inhibition of interaction of CDC37 with HSP90, triptolide
could be docked to both HSP90 with a binding energy of
-6.7 Kcal/mol and to the HSP90-CDC37 complex with
a binding energy of -9.4 Kcal/mol. We further determined
that triptolide formed hydrogen bonds with Phe37 (at
a distance of 3.4 Å), Asp127 (3.4 Å) of the N terminus
domain of HSP90 alone and formed hydrogen bonds
with residues Asp169 (3.3 Å) of CDC37 and residues
Asp57 (32. Å), Ser53 (2.5 Å) and Ser50 (3.1 Å) of
HSP90 (Figure 3B) in the HSP90-CDC37 complex. We
determined that amino acid residues 117, 121, 123, 124,
125, 126 and 129 of HSP90 and 160, 161, 164, 165, 166,
167, 168, 193, 202, 204, 205 and 208 of CDC37 are among
the key residues involved in HSP90-CDC37 interaction
[39]. Our docking studies reveal that by interacting with
critical residues on HSP90 and CDC37 (including Leu 205
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

as reported in earlier studies), triptolide can potentially
bind to and disrupt the interaction of the HSP90-CDC37
complex [39]. Consequently we observed that treatment
with triptolide resulted in the partial depletion of kinase
clients of HSP90 such as BTK, c-RAF and CDK4 in
cultured and primary CLL cells (Figure 3C), with no
decrease in the levels of non-HSP90 client kinases,
ERK1/2 and CHK2 (Figure 3D).
We then asked how knockdown of HSF1 affects the
chaperone function of HSP90. shRNA-mediated stable
knockdown of HSF1 in Mec-1 cells resulted in decreased
expression of HSPs both at the mRNA and protein level
(Figures 4A & 4B). Knockdown of HSF1 decreased the
association of HSP90 with CDC37, with only a moderate
decrease in the total levels of CDC37 and AHSA1
(Figure 4C bottom panel), ruling out the possibility
that the observed effects on CDC37 binding were due
to loss of CDC37/AHSA1 expression. Consequently,
knockdown of HSF1 resulted in the partial depletion
of HSP90 kinase clients- BTK, c-RAF and CDK4
(Figure 4D). These observations suggest that inhibition
of HSF1 either by triptolide or HSF1 knockdown can
affect HSP90-CDC37 association and the chaperoning
of HSP90 kinase clients.

Treatment with triptolide and knockdown of
HSF1 disrupts the HSP90-HSF1-HDAC6-p97
complex and promotes HSP90 acetylation

regulated by the activity of the acetyl transferase (p300)
and its deacetylase HDAC6 [40]. We therefore determined
whether HSF1 knockdown affects the binding of HSP90
to p300. As shown in Figure 5C, knockdown of HSF1
results in the decreased binding of HSP90 to its acetyl
transferase p300. Consequently, knockdown of HSF1 was
associated with an increase in the acetylation of HSP90 in
cultured and primary CLL cells (Figure 5D and 5E).
In order to assess whether p300 inhibition would
reduce HSP90 acetylation under conditions where HDAC6
binding to HSP90 is also compromised, we treated HSF1
knockdown cells with C646, a small molecule inhibitor
of p300 activity [45, 46]. Consistent with the notion
that inhibition of p300 activity would decrease HSF1
knockdown-induced acetylation of HSP90, we observed that
treatment with C646 resulted in a decrease in the extent of
HSP90 acetylation (lane 4 versus lane 3) in shHSF1 infected
Mec-1 cells (Figure 6A upper panel). This was associated
with the restoration of CDC37 binding to HSP90 in HSF1
knockdown cells as well as its kinase clients, c-RAF and
CDK4 (Figure 6A, lower panel). Furthermore, transient

It has been reported that HSF1 is held in
a “repressed” state in a complex comprising HSP90HSF1-HDAC6-p97. We explored the possibility that
reduced levels of HSF1 following HSF1 knockdown or
treatment with triptolide (Figure 2D) could result in the
disruption of the repressive complex [8]. We reasoned
that non-stoichiometric levels of HSF1 might reduce
the association of HSP90 with its deacetylase HDAC6
in the repressive complex, leading to HSP90 acetylation
and inhibition of its chaperone function [40–44]. Indeed,
acetylation-mimetic HSP90 (K/Q) mutants in the middle
domain of HSP90 (K100, K292, K327, K478, K546,
and K558) display reduced association of HSP90 with
its co-chaperones and client proteins [40, 41]. Treatment
with triptolide or stable knockdown of HSF1 disrupted
the binding of HDAC6 with HSP90, p97 and HSF1
(Figure 5A & 5B). Reversible acetylation of HSP90 is

cells were injected into the tail vein of in Rag2-/-,
IL2Rγ-/- mice to induce CLL, as previously described
[47]. Treatment with minnelide commenced when the
mice showed measurable average radiance of at least
1.00E+06 p/sec/cm2/sr and continued for 28 days. All
mice were monitored regularly for disease progression
by weekly bioluminescent imaging. As evident from
Figures 7A and 7B, at week 1 post-injection of Mec1luciferase cells, both control and minnelide treatment
group of mice showed comparable induction of the
disease. Treatment with minnelide resulted in a significant
decrease in radiance compared to control mice by week 3.
Furthermore, minnelide treatment conferred a significant
survival advantage (p ≤ 0.0003) compared to control mice
(Figure 7C) with the median survival for control mice
being 19 days. Notably treatment with minnelide did not

expression of an sh-RNA-insensitive HSF1 (sh#2-mut)
plasmid in sh#2 Mec-1 cells restores HSF1 expression
(Figure 6B upper panel) and decreases the extent of
HSP90 acetylation (lane 4 versus lane 3) as well as restores
HSP90 binding to CDC37 (Figure 6B lower panels). These
observations collectively establish a causal link between A,
HSF1 expression and HSP90 acetylation and B, HSF1
expression and the ability of HSP90 to bind to CDC37.

against CLL cells, we asked whether it could be used to
impair CLL growth and maintenance in vivo. Owing to the

affect the body score of the animals (see supplementary
Figure 3) throughout the course of the treatment. On
day 50 (p < 0.0003 for Kaplan Meier analysis), three
mice from the minnelide-treated group, were sacrificed
to carry out correlative studies. The remaining minnelidetreated mice (n = 5) were alive even at day 60, after which
the experiment was terminated. As noted in Figure 7D,
minnelide-treated mice showed reduced spleen size
compared to control mice (n = 3 per group). Consistent
with the inhibition of HSF1/HSP90 function, treatment
with minnelide resulted in a decrease in the levels of
BTK in the treated-group. Considering the importance
of B-cell receptor (BCR)-induced BTK-PLCγ2-AKT
signaling cascade in CLL, we determined the effect of
minnelide treatment on the phosphorylation of PLCγ2
and AKT [21]. Our data suggests that minnelide reduces
the levels of p-PLCγ2 and p-AKT in the spleens of the
treated mice (Figure 7E). Treatment with minnelide also
resulted in a significant reduction in the levels of HSPs
in the xenografts, consistent with the previously reported

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

effects of minnelide on HSP70 [30]. Collectively, these
observations suggest that inhibition of HSF1 in vivo
decreases tumor burden and delays leukemogenesis. These
pre-clinical findings create a strong rationale to test the
efficacy of minnelide as a chemotherapeutic agent against
CLL in humans.

DISCUSSION
In this study we have identified HSF1 as
a therapeutic target in indolent as well as aggressive
CLL. We demonstrate for the first time that treatment
with triptolide or depletion of cellular HSF1 levels
disrupts the association of HSF1 with components of the
cytosolic repressive complex comprising HSF1-HSP90HDAC6-p97, resulting in the acetylation of HSP90.
Consistent with the destabilization of HSP90 clients
following HSP90 acetylation, we demonstrate that HSF1
inhibition (with triptolide) or depletion (by shRNA)
abrogates the binding of HSP90 to its kinase client

proteins c-RAF, BTK and CDK4 resulting in their partial
depletion.
It is not clear not why shHSF1-#1 (50% HSF1
knockdown) causes greater depletion of the levels of
HSP90 client proteins compared to shHSF1-#2 (70%
knockdown) in Mec-1 cells. A possible explanation
could be because HSP90 is more accessible to p300
binding in shHSF1-sh#1 compared to shSHF1-#2
Mec-1 cells (Figure 5C). Secondly, it is not clear
if and how HSF1 inhibition/depletion affects the
phosphorylation of CDC37 or HSP90, which would
in turn affect the binding of CDC37 to its clients
or HSP90, respectively [48, 49]. However, as has
been reported following treatment with celastrol, a
disruptor of HSP90-CDC37 complex, it is likely that
triptolide might also affect HSP90 chaperone activity
by covalently modifying CDC37 [50]. Unlike celastrol
and geldanamycin analogues, triptolide does not induce
a heat shock response, thus distinguishing its mechanism
of action from that of celastrol or other geldanamycin
analogues which result in the transcriptional upregulation of HSPs [51]. The fact that triptolide directly
binds to HSP90 at low nanomolar concentrations,
suggests that HSP90 is a target of triptolide action.
We report that treatment with triptolide causes
apoptosis in cultured and primary CLL cells. While
HSF1 knockdown does not phenocopy treatment with
triptolide in terms of inducing apoptosis, it does cause
cell cycle arrest at the G0-G1 phase (for shHSF1-#2)
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

or G1-S phase (for sh#1) (supplementary Figure 4) and
inhibits B-cell survival signaling in vivo. These factors
could adversely affect CLL cell survival as well as
leukemogenesis in vivo. We demonstrate that treatment
with minnelide, a  pro-drug of triptolide, significantly
improved survival in a mouse model of CLL utilizing
Mec-1 cells. Minnelide is converted to triptolide in
vivo by the action of alkaline phosphatases. As such,
minnelide cannot be used in vitro without conversion
into its parent compound as described previously [25].
Our findings point to the fact that minnelide is an
effective anti-CLL agent when used as a monotherapy,
with no observable toxicity, in contrast to reported
toxic effects of triptolide. Considering the fact that
many CLL patients live for prolonged periods without
treatment, the ability of minnelide to delay disease
progression in CLL (or possibly impact the natural
history of the disease) could be translated clinically
into testing its  efficacy  as  a  chemotherapeutic and/or
a chemopreventive agent.
While most of the demonstrated effects of
triptolide action have been the inhibition of HSP70
function or transcriptional inhibition of several tumor
promoting genes, our studies highlight yet another
aspect of its mechanism of action viz., HSP90 inhibition
as evidenced by reduced in vivo BTK-PLCγ2-AKT
signaling [11, 30, 52]. Based on our observation that
triptolide is effective against relapsed/refractory
CLL B cells, it is tempting to speculate that HSF1

Reagents, cell culture, isolation of primary
CD19+ CLL cells and

inhibitors could also be used effectively against the
entire spectrum of CLL patients, as it affects the BCR
signaling cascade. Collectively our results provide a
strong rationale to test the clinical efficacy of minnelide
against human CLL.

Triptolide and C646 were purchased from Selleck
chemicals. HSF1 expression plasmid (HSF1-GFPN3)
was obtained from Addgene. Mec-1 cells were purchased
from DSMZ. Mec-2 and WAC3-CD5+ cells were obtained
from Dr. H. Shi (GRU Cancer Center, GA). All cells
were cultured as described previously and authenticated
by surface staining and flow cytometry for CD19, CD20
and CD79a [53]. Stable knockdown of HSF1 was carried
out in Mec-1 and WaC3-CD5+ cells using lentiviral nontargeted or two independent HSF1 shRNA constructs
(Sigma Aldrich, MO). De-identified and de-linked primary
CLL samples were obtained from the Biorepository Core
Facility of Kansas University Medical Center, after

MATERIALS AND METHODS

informed consent using an institutional review boardapproved protocol (HSC-5929). CD19+ B cells from newly
diagnosed, relapsed or treatment refractory CLL patients
were isolated from the samples utilizing a magnetic
CD19-positive selection kit (Stem Cell Technologies,
Vancouver, BC), as described previously [54]. The purity
of the isolated CD19+ B-cell fraction was assessed using
CD19-PE conjugated antibodies (BD Biosciences, San
Jose, CA) and flow cytometry. Positively selected cells
were re-suspended in 20% FBS containing RPMI prior to
performing the studies described.

(Enzo Life Sciences, Inc., Farmigdale, NY), washed with
PBS and HSF1 staining was visualized using secondary
antibodies conjugated with Alexa Fluor-555. The slides
were counterstained with DAPI to visualize the nucleus.
Images are acquired using Pascal confocal microscope
(Carl Zeiss) and processed with LSM-510 browser (Carl
Zeiss) and Adobe Photoshop CS, as described previously
[55].

Cell death and cell cycle analysis
Cultured and primary CD19+ B cells were exposed
to triptolide for 48 hours and stained with Annexin
V-FITC and propidium iodide (PI). Apoptotic cells were
determined by flow cytometric analysis by measuring
the percentage of Annexin V and PI positive cells, as
described previously [43]. The fraction of cells in G0-G1,
S and G2-M phase of cell cycle were stained with PI and
quantified as described previously, by flow cytometry [43].

shRNA-mediated knockdown of HSF1 and
transfection of shRNA-insensitive HSF1 mutant
plasmid in Mec-1 cells
Knockdown of HSF1 was carried out in Mec-1 and
WaC3-CD5+ cells using lentiviral non-targeted or two
independent HSF1 shRNA constructs (Sigma Aldrich,
MO). Stable clones were selected by growing shRNAinfected cells in puromycin. HSF1-GFPN3 construct
was used as a template to obtain an shRNA-insensitive
HSF1 (mutant) plasmid. For this purpose, the shHSF1-#2
sequence (GCCCAAGTACTTCAAGCACAA) was
mutagenized utilizing the site-directed mutagenesis kit
(QuikChange II site-directed mutagenesis kit, Agilent
technologies Inc., CA) to the following sequence
GCCTAAATACTTCAAACATAA (mutations introduced
are underlined). Mutations were confirmed by DNA
sequencing. One microgram of the mutant plasmid was
introduced into Mec-1 cells using the X-tremeGENEHP DNA transfection reagent (Roche). Forty eight
hours later, the cells were harvested and used for further
experiments.

Molecular docking studies
Docking of triptolide to the HSP90-CDC37
complex was performed using AutoDock Vina software
as described previously [56]. All predictions were made
using the crystal structure of HSP90-CDC37 from the
available protein data bank (PDB:2K5B) and the chemical
structure of triptolide [39]. The best conformation was
chosen with the lowest binding energy to make predictions
about the hydrogen bonding between triptolide and the
HSP90-CDC37 complex.

In vivo Mec-1-luciferase cell xenografts
In vivo CLL xenografts were generated by injecting
five million Mec-1-luciferase cells were injected into
the tail vein of Rag2−/−γ(c)−/− immune deficient mice
[47]. Mice were randomized and divided into 2 groups
(n = 8) such that the average radiance was 1.00E+06 per
group before they were treated minnelide. On day 7 after
injection of cells, control mice received saline and the
treatment group received daily intraperitoneal injection
of minnelide at a dose of 0.42 mg/kg body weight for
four weeks. Tumor burden was determined by in vivo
bioluminescent imaging of the mice using a Xenogen IVIS
2000 in vivo imaging system (Caliper Life Sciences) every
week. Mice were humanely sacrificed when they lost
15% of their body weight or when they showed signs of
advanced disease, including hind limb paralysis. The day
of death or euthanasia was noted and plotted on a KaplanMeier plot as previously described [55]. Molecular
analysis of the effect of minnelide treatment was assessed
by evaluating HSP90-dependent signaling pathways in the
spleens of three mice from the minnelide-treated group
(sacrificed on day 50) and compared with 3 control mice
(spleens collected after euthanasia).

Nuclear-cytosolic fractionation,
immunoprecipitation and immunoblot analyses
CLL cell pellets were subjected to nuclear-cytosolic
fractionation using NE-PER nuclear and cytoplasmic
extraction kit (Pierce biotechnology, Rockford, IL).
Immunoprecipitation of HDAC6, CDC37, p300 and
HSP90 was performed as described previously [43, 54].
Immunoblot analyses were performed utilizing antiHSF1, HSP90 alpha, HSP70, HSP27, BTK, c-RAF,
CDK4, CDC37 and acetyl-lysine antibodies as previously
described [43]. β-actin expression was used as a loading
control. The data presented are representative of three
independent experiments.

Confocal immunofluorescent microscopy
CD19+ B cells were cytospun onto glass slides,
fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, treated with 0.5%
Triton-X-100 and blocked with 3% BSA. The slides
were incubated with HSF1 specific rabbit antibodies
