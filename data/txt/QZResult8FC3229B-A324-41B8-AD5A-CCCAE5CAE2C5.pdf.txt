Abstract
Adhesion G-protein–coupled receptors (GPCR), which contain adhesion domains in their extracellular
region, have been found to play important roles in cell adhesion, motility, embryonic development, and
immune response. Because most adhesion molecules with adhesion domains have vital roles in cancer
metastasis, we speculated that adhesion GPCRs are potentially involved in cancer metastasis. In this study,
we identiﬁed GPR116 as a novel regulator of breast cancer metastasis through expression and functional
screening of the adhesion GPCR family. We found that knockdown of GPR116 in highly metastatic (MDA-MB231) breast cancer cells suppressed cell migration and invasion. Conversely, ectopic GPR116 expression in
poorly metastatic (MCF-7 and Hs578T) cells promoted cell invasion. We further showed that knockdown
of GPR116 inhibited breast cancer cell metastasis in two mammary tumor metastasis mouse models.
Moreover, GPR116 modulated the formation of lamellipodia and actin stress ﬁbers in cells in a RhoA- and
Rac1-dependent manner. At a molecular level, GPR116 regulated cell motility and morphology through the
Gaq-p63RhoGEF-RhoA/Rac1 pathway. The biologic signiﬁcance of GPR116 in breast cancer is substantiated
in human patient samples, where GPR116 expression is signiﬁcantly correlated with breast tumor progression, recurrence, and poor prognosis. These ﬁndings show that GPR116 is crucial for the metastasis of
breast cancer and support GPR116 as a potential prognostic marker and drug target against metastatic
human breast cancer. Cancer Res; 73(20); 6206–18. 2013 AACR.

Introduction
Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality in females worldwide (1). Death caused by breast
cancer primarily results from cancer cells metastasizing to
distal organs such as lung, bone, liver, or brain. Cell motility
is regulated by the cytoskeleton, and disruptions in cytoskeletal regulation are a means by which cancer cells develop inappropriate migratory and invasive characteristics,

leading to metastasis (2). The Rho family GTPases, including
RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42, are essential for cytoskeletal dynamics, especially cancer cell migration (3, 4). Among them,
RhoA regulates the actin cytoskeleton in stress ﬁber formation (5). Rac1 modulates a meshwork of actin ﬁlaments at
the cell periphery to produce lamellipodia and membrane
rufﬂes (5). Activated Rho GTPases induce multiple downstream signaling pathways during cancer cell migration,
such as ROCK1/2 signaling (4). All Rho GTPases cycle
between an inactive guanosine diphosphate (GDP)-bound
and an active guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-bound state.
The process is accelerated by a large family of Rho guanine
nucleotide exchange factors (Rho GEF; ref. 6). One such Rho
GEF is p63RhoGEF (also called GEFT), which is known as an
effector of the heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide–binding
protein Gaq and thereby links Gaq-coupled receptors
(GPCR) to the activation of the Rho GTPases (6). Gaqp63RhoGEF-Rho GTPase has been reported as a protein
complex (6), which is involved in multiple physiologic functions such as vascular smooth muscle contractility (7) and
cell movement (8).
G-protein–coupled receptors (GPCR or GPR) are integral
membrane proteins participating in the transmission of
signals from the extracellular environment to the cytoplasm.
A variety of external stimuli, including neurotransmitters,
hormones, phospholipids, growth factors, and proteases, can

GPR116 Promotes Metastases through Gaq Pathway

activate GPCRs (9, 10). Activated GPCRs typically transduce
signals to effector proteins through their heterotrimeric G
proteins. These signaling pathways represent important
speciﬁc targets for a variety of physiologic functions and
therapeutic approaches, ranging from the control of blood
pressure, allergic response, kidney function, and hormonal
disorders to neurologic diseases (11). As a result, approximately 50% of marketed pharmaceuticals target human
GPCRs or their signaling pathways (12). However, there are
few GPCRs that are cancer therapeutic targets. The adhesion
GPCRs are the second largest GPCR family with 33 members,
most of which are orphan receptors (13). This family is very
special because of the so-called adhesion domains in their
long N-terminal extracellular regions. Adhesion domains,
which are thought to have adhesive properties, mainly exist
in some adhesion molecules such as integrins, cadherins,
and selectins. However, limited studies have shown that
adhesion GPCRs are involved in the regulation of cell
adhesion, motility, embryonic development, and immune
response (12–14). GPR116, named Ig-hepta in the rat, is a
member of the adhesion GPCR family. Previous studies
showed that rat Gpr116 forms a dimer and is cleaved at
multiple sites in the N-terminal region yielding several
fragments with unknown functions (15–17). Recent evidence
from an adipocyte-speciﬁc GPR116-knockout mouse model
shows that GPR116 plays a critical role in adipocyte biology
and systemic energy homeostasis (18). Further research on
lung development indicates that GPR116 regulates pulmonary surfactant pool size and is important for lung surfactant homeostasis (19, 20). These discoveries implicate the
physiologic and pathologic functions of GPR116.
As the adhesion molecules (integrins, cadherins, and selectins, etc.) have an important function in cancer metastasis (12),
it is reasonable to speculate that adhesion GPCRs also have
vital functions in cancer progression and metastasis. In this
study, we screened the adhesion GPCR family and identiﬁed
GPR116 as a novel regulator of breast cancer cell migration and
invasion in vitro and metastasis in vivo by modulation of the
Gaq-p63RhoGEF-Rho GTPases signaling pathway. Moreover,
GPR116 is strongly correlated with breast cancer progression,
metastasis and poor prognosis by analysis of human breast
cancer clinical samples. Our results suggest that GPR116 is a
potential regulator for cancer metastasis that may have value
as a prognostic marker.

Materials and Methods

Chinese Academy of Sciences Committee Type Culture Collection Cell Bank. The cell lines were authenticated by the
Chinese Academy of Sciences Committee Type Culture Collection Cell Bank. All the culture media and reagents were from
Gibco. Antibodies against RhoA (67B9), Cdc42 (11A11), MLC2
(#3672S), p-MLC2 (#3671S), Coﬁlin (#3312), and p-Coﬁlin
(77G2) were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology; monoclonal anti-b-actin (A2228) and anti-Flag (F7425) antibodies
were from Sigma; antibodies to GNAq (E17) and GNA11 (D17)

www.aacrjournals.org

were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology; and monoclonal anti-Rac1 (23A8) antibody was obtained from Millipore,
and GPR116 (Ab111169) antibody used to conduct immunohistochemistry on human breast cancer tissue was purchased
from Abcam.
GPR116 mouse monoclonal antibody production
The fragment of 27 amino acid residues from the N terminal
region of human GPR116, with the sequence of "WNYESTIHPLSLHEHEPAGEEALRQKR," was synthesized and used as
immunogen. BALB/c mice were immunized by intraperitoneal
injection with 100 mg of immunogen (dissolved in PBS) in a 50%
emulsion with complete Freunds adjuvant on day 1 and
boosted by intraperitoneal injection on days 21 and 36 with
immunogen in incomplete Freunds adjuvant. After 60 days,
freshly harvested spleen cells obtained from the immunized
mice were prepared for cell fusion to generate hybridoma lines,
which were subsequently screened by ELISA and immunoblotting. The speciﬁcity of the antibody for immunoblotting
was examined using a competition strategy with the antigen
peptide.
Immunoﬂuorescence staining
After plating on coverslips and culturing in 24-well plates,
cells were ﬁxed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 minutes,
permeabilized with 0.1% Triton/PBS for 5 minutes at room
temperature, and blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin for
30 minutes. Then the cells were incubated with primary
antibody for 1 hour, followed by incubation with the appropriate secondary antibody or Alexa Fluor 594 phalloidin for 30
minutes at room temperature. Finally, cells were photographed
with a confocal laser scanning microscope (Leica TCS SP5).
The concentrations of antibodies or dyes were: anti-paxillin
(BD, 610051), 1 mg/mL; Alexa Fluor 488–conjugated anti-rabbit
IgG (Invitrogen), 1 mg/mL; and Alexa Fluor 594 phalloidin
(Invitrogen), 1:500 dilutions.
GTPase activity assay
RhoA activity in cell lysates was measured using the fusion
protein of glutathione S-transferase (GST) and the RhoAbinding domain of Rhotekin (RBD). For Rac1 and Cdc42
activities, GST-PBD, a GST fusion protein with the binding
domain of PAK, was used. Brieﬂy, both fusion proteins
expressed in BL21 were puriﬁed with glutathione Sepharose
beads (GE Healthcare). Cell lysates were prepared with RhoA
lysis buffer [50 mmol/L Tris–HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mmol/L NaCl,
5 mmol/L MgCl2, 1 mmol/L dithiothreitol, 1 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl ﬂuoride (PMSF), 1% Triton X-100, proteinase
inhibitor cocktail] or Rac1 lysis buffer (20 mmol/L HEPESNaOH, pH 7.5, 120 mmol/L NaCl, 10% glycerol, 2 mmol/L
EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mmol/L PMSF, proteinase inhibitor cocktail] and incubated with GST-RBD or GST-PBD precoupled to glutathione Sepharose beads at 4 C for 45 minutes
to precipitate GTP-bound RhoA, Rac1, or Cdc42. The precipitant was boiled in Laemmli sample buffer, and eluted product
was separated on a 12% SDS-PAGE gel. Immunoblotting
was used to detect the protein level of total and GTP-bound
RhoA, Rac1, or Cdc2.

Wound-healing migration and Transwell invasion
assays
For the migration assay, cells were cultured in 12-well plates
coated with rat collagen type 1 (10 mg/mL; BD). When 90%
conﬂuent, cells were starved for 12 hours. Then, a wound
was scratched in the center of the cell monolayer by a sterile
plastic pipette tip. The debris was removed by washing with
PBS twice. After 12-hour incubation, the wound was photographed under an inverted microscope. For the invasion assay,
Transwell ﬁlter membranes were coated with 50 mL Matrigel
(BD Biosciences; diluted 1:1 in DMEM) and incubated at
room temperature for 30 minutes before cells were seeded.
A total of 5  104 cells suspended in medium without FBS were
plated on the upper chamber membranes (8-mm pore size,
6.5-mm diameter; Corning). The insert was then transferred
to a well containing 600 mL medium with 10% FBS. Cells were
incubated for 8 to 24 hours at 37 C in a humidiﬁed incubator.
Noninvasive cells were removed by swiping the top of membrane with cotton swabs, and invasive cells were stained with
crystal violet and counted.
Cell proliferation and apoptosis assays
Cell growth was monitored by cell counting on the indicated
days after seeding. Brieﬂy, cells were plated in 6-well plates at a
density of 3  104 cells per well. On the indicated day, cell
number was counted. Cellular apoptosis was monitored by the
FITC Annexin V Apoptosis Detection Kit (BD) according to the
manufacturer's protocol. Brieﬂy, cells stained with ﬂuorescein
isothiocyanate (FITC) Annexin V and propidium iodide (PI)
were detected by ﬂuorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS).
The PI and FITC double-negative cells were counted as healthy
cells.
Reverse transcription PCR and real-time reverse
transcription PCR
Total RNA was isolated from cells and cDNA was synthesized using the Prime Script RT-PCR Kit from Takara. Two-step
real-time PCR was carried out using SYBR Green Mix (Takara).
The expression of the b-actin gene in each sample was used as
an internal control. All the primers used are listed in Supplementary Table S1.
Immunoblotting
Samples prepared in Laemmli buffer were separated using
SDS-PAGE. Brieﬂy, the separated proteins were transferred to
nitrocellulose membranes (Millipore). After blocking for 1 hour
in 5% non–fat dried milk and PBS (w/v), membranes were
incubated with primary antibody at 4 C overnight. The membranes were washed three times with PBST and incubated with
infrared dye–labeled secondary antibody for 45 minutes.
Immunoblotting was visualized using the LI-COR Odyssey
System.
Plasmid constructs
Full-length coding DNA sequence of human GPR116
(ENSEMBL ID: ENST00000283296 and ENST00000265417) was
ampliﬁed using the forward primer 50 -CCGCTCGAGTGGACAGGCCAACCAACTC-30 and the reverse primer: 50 -ATAA-

Cancer Res; 73(20) October 15, 2013

GAATGCGGCCCGGAGGTCACGTAGGTTGG -30 . The PCR
product was cloned into the lentiviral vector pLVX-IRESZsGreen1. The constitutively active mutants of RhoA, Rac1,
and Gq were cloned as previously described (21). Full-length
RGS2 and the RGS domain of p115RhoGEF (including amino
acid residues 1–252) were ampliﬁed by PCR and cloned into
the EcoR1/BamH1 site of p3FLAG-CMV-10.
siRNA and short hairpin RNA preparation and
transfection
The nontargeting control short hairpin RNA (shRNA;
shNTC, 50 GTTCTCCGAACGTGTCACGTT30 ) and 2 GPR116
shRNAs (shGPR116 #1, 50 CGGCTGAAGAATACACTGTTAC30 ; shGPR116 #2, 50 GGACTACAACTCCTTTCAAGCC30 )
targeting GPR116 mRNA (ENSEMBL ID: ENST00000283296
and ENST00000265417) were cloned into the lentiviral vector pLKO.1-puro. The nontargeting control siRNA (scrambled siRNA, 50 UUCUCCGAACGUGUCACGUTT30 ) and GPR116
siRNA oligos (GPR116 siRNA, 50 CCUUGUGUUCCAUAUCAUATT30 ; si30 -UTR, 50 GACAGACCCUGUCAUAUAU30 ) against
GPR116 were obtained from GenePharma. Cells were transfected with appropriate plasmids or siRNAs using Lipofectamine reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's
protocol.
Lentivirus preparation, lentiviral infections, and stable
cell lines
To produce viral constructs, 10 mg of lentiviral vector
(pLKO.1-puro and pLVX-IRES-ZsGreen1), 10 mg of pSPAX2,
and 5 mg of pMD2G were cotransfected into human embryonic
kidney 293T cells using Lipofectamine reagent (Invitrogen).
Supernatants were collected 48 hours after transfection and
ﬁltered through a 0.45-mm membrane (Millipore). Then, cells
were directly infected using 8 mg/mL of polybrene for 6 to
24 hours. To get stable knockdown cells, growth medium
containing 1 mg/mL of puromycin (Sigma) was added for
1 week before use in experiments. To obtain a high-expression
population, cells infected with vector pLVX-IRES-ZsGreen1
were sorted by FACS in the GFP channel.
Breast cancer cell migration following ectopic GPR116
expression
Breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells were transfected with
si30 -UTR, which targets the 30 -untranslated region (UTR) of
GPR116 transcripts (ENSEMBL ID: ENST00000283296 and
ENST00000265417). After 12 hours, the cells were infected
with a lentivirus for expression of the GPR116 coding sequence and then were sorted by FACS in the GFP channel to
ensure 100% infection because the expression vector (pLVXIRES-ZsGreen1) expresses an extra GFP protein. Transwell
chamber assay was then conducted as previously described.
In vivo mouse experiments and analyses
All animal work was conducted in accordance with accepted
standards of the Ethics Committee of East China Normal
University. The mouse tail vein injection tumor lung metastasis
model and the mouse left ventricle injection tumor bone
metastasis model were conducted as described previously

(22). Paraformaldehyde-ﬁxed mouse tissues were embedded in
parafﬁn and sectioned (4 mm). The parafﬁnized sections of
mouse tissues and human tissue microarray were treated with
0.3% hydrogen peroxide/methanol and incubated with monoclonal antibodies in Immunol Staining Primary Antibody
Dilution Buffer (Beyotime, #P0103) followed by incubation
with the Histostain-Plus IHC Kit reagents (Rabbit Primary,
Mt-bio#LHK612) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Bioluminescence measurement
In vivo bone and lung metastasis assay was monitored by
bioluminescence imaging (Caliper Life Sciences) as previously
described (23). Brieﬂy, to detect metastases of MDA-MB-231
breast cancer cells stably expressing luciferase at indicated
days, anesthetized mice were injected with 150 mg/kg D-luciferin potassium salt (115144-35-9, AOK chem). Bioluminescence was assayed, and photon per second was quantiﬁed by
software (Living Image3.2, Caliper).
Tissue microarray and survival analysis in patient
sample
The human tissue microarray was bought from Cybrdi Biotechnology, including #BR8010, #CC08-11, #BR10010, #BR1503,
#BR2082, and #BR721. All the pathologic diagnosis was supplied in the manufacturer's instructions of the product. Tissue
core staining was classiﬁed as either negative or positive. The
positive cores were further subdivided by the intensity of
GPR116 staining into either low or high groups by 2 researchers, respectively. GPR116 expression levels in tumor samples
for survival analysis derived from the discovery cohort were
determined by microarray analysis using Affymetrix U133B
Genechips (Affymetrix). The raw database is available at the
GEO (GSE6532; ref. 24).
Statistical analysis
Experiments were carried out with 3 or more replicates. The
results were reported as mean  SD or mean  SEM and are
indicated in the ﬁgure legends. Data were analyzed using SPSS
13.0 for Windows version (Chicago). For comparisons of
central tendencies, normally distributed data sets were analyzed using unpaired 2-sided Student t tests under assumption
of equal variance. Non-normally distributed data sets were
analyzed using nonparametric Mann–Whitney U tests. The
normality of data sets was evaluated visually using Q–Q plots
and tested statistically using Shapiro–Wilk tests. Survival
curves were analyzed according to the Kaplan–Meier method,
and for differences between curves, the P value was calculated
by the log-rank test. The c2 test was applied to analyze the
relationship between GPR116 expression status and clinicopathologic status. Differences were considered as statistically
signiﬁcant data when P < 0.05. Immunoblotting density was
quantiﬁed by ImageJ software.

Results
Identiﬁcation of GPR116 as a regulator of breast cancer
cell migration and invasion
We speculated that adhesion GPCRs may play important
roles in cancer metastasis because most of them contain

www.aacrjournals.org

adhesion domains in their N-terminus. To identify potential
adhesion GPCRs involved in cancer cell migration, we screened
the expression of various adhesion GPCRs in MDA-MB-231, a
highly metastatic breast cancer cell line, using reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR; Fig. 1A). Fourteen adhesion GPCRs
were found to be highly expressed in MDA-MB-231 cells
(Supplementary Fig. S1). To explore their roles in breast cancer cell migration, we used siRNAs to downregulate the
expression of each of the 14 adhesion GPCRs and used a
wound-healing assay to examine the effect of knockdown on
migration. Our data showed that silencing GPR116 by speciﬁc
siRNA (Supplementary Fig. S2A) signiﬁcantly reduced cell
migration (Fig. 1B), suggesting that GPR116 is a novel regulator
of breast cancer cell migration.
To conﬁrm the role of GPR116 in breast cancer cell migration, we made 2 stable GPR116-knockdown cell lines using
lentiviral transduction of 2 different speciﬁc shRNAs in MDAMB-231 cells. The knockdown of GPR116 expression was
conﬁrmed by Western blotting in the 2 shRNAs stably transfected cells (Supplementary Fig. S2B). As shown in Fig. 1C,
knockdown of GPR116 markedly reduced breast cancer cell
invasion as measured by a Transwell invasion assay. To further
conﬁrm that shRNA effects were due to speciﬁc knockdown
of GPR116, we transduced an expression vector with only
the coding sequence of GPR116 into the cells expressing
siRNA targeting a noncoding sequence in the 30 -UTR of
GPR116. The results showed that re-introduction of GPR116
cDNA into the GPR116-knockdown cells rescued the invasive
ability of the cells (Fig. 1D) by increasing the expression of
GPR116 (Supplementary Fig. S2D), indicating that GPR116
rather than off-target shRNA effects is responsible for the
invasive phenotype of MDA-MB-231 cells.
To exclude an effect of GPR116 knockdown on cell
proliferation and apoptosis, we examined cell growth and
apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 cells with stable knockdown of
GPR116. Our data show that GPR116 knockdown had little
effect on cell growth over 5 days (Supplementary Fig. S3A).
Furthermore, little apoptosis was observed in GPR116knockdown breast cancer cells by Annexin V apoptosis
assay (Supplementary Fig. S3B and S3C), suggesting that
the effects of GPR116 on breast cancer cell migration and
invasion are not mediated by changes in cell growth or
apoptosis.
To further conﬁrm the effects of GPR116 on breast cancer cell migration and invasion, we examined whether overexpression of GPR116 promoted cell invasion in breast cancer
cells (MCF-7 and Hs578T) that express low levels of GPR116
(Supplementary Fig. S4). Our data showed that overexpression of GPR116 remarkably promoted cell invasion of MCF-7
and Hs578T, respectively (Fig. 1E and F), indicating that the
expression levels of GPR116 directly correlated with breast
cancer cell migration and invasion.
Knockdown of GPR116 in breast cancer cells reduces
lung and bone metastasis in vivo
To examine whether GPR116 regulates breast cancer
cell metastasis in vivo, we investigated lung metastasis of
MDA-MB-231 cells using mouse tail vein injection (Fig. 2A).

As expected, the luciferase-labeled control MDA-MB-231
cells efﬁciently metastasized to the lung region after 24 days.
In contrast, knockdown of GPR116 signiﬁcantly reduced the
ability of the 2 stable knockdown breast cancer cells (Fig. 2A
and B) to form lung metastases, suggesting a role of GPR116
in breast cancer cell metastasis to the lung tissue.
To further examine the role of GPR116 in tumor metastasis, we also investigated bone metastases of breast cancer
cells using the mouse left ventricle injection tumor metastasis
model, an extensively used model for tumor bone metastasis
(22, 23). As shown in Fig. 2C and D, control tumor cells were
predominantly detected in the hind legs and strongly induced
osteolytic bone metastasis. The knockdown of GPR116 signiﬁcantly reduced the development of bone metastases (Fig. 2C

6210

Cancer Res; 73(20) October 15, 2013

and E) and strikingly decreased the osteolytic lesion area (Fig.
2D and F). As a result, decreased GPR116 expression was
associated with a signiﬁcant prolongation in survival for tumor-bearing mice (Fig. 2G). Taken together, these data suggest
that GPR116 regulates breast tumor cell metastases in vivo.

formation in breast cancer cells
To examine the mechanisms underlying GPR116 regulation of cell migration and invasion, we investigated cell
morphology in GPR116-knockdown MDA-MB-231 cells. As
shown in Fig. 3A, knockdown of GPR116 led to remarkable
cell morphology changes, characterized by an elongated
cellular morphology (Fig. 3A). Similar results were obtained

numbers of elongated cells were remarkably increased from
10.3% (control cells) to 50.0% and 47.5% in the 2 stable
GPR116-knockdown cell lines, respectively (Fig. 3B). Moreover, knockdown of GPR116 led to much narrower lamellipodia spreading in more than 90% of GPR116-knockdown
cells (Fig. 3A). Conversely, overexpression of GPR116 in
MCF-7 cells dramatically increased the formation of stress
ﬁbers and induced lamellipodia (Fig. 3C). These results
indicate that GPR116 regulates the formation of lamellipodia
and stress ﬁbers in breast cancer cells.

GPR116 regulates breast cancer cell migration through
RhoA- and Rac1-dependent pathways
To examine the mechanism by which GPR116 regulates the
formation of lamellipodia and stress ﬁbers, we investigated the
activation of Rac1 and RhoA, respectively (4). As shown in Fig.
3D, knockdown of GPR116 expression signiﬁcantly decreased
RhoA and Rac1 activity but did not affect the activity of Cdc42
in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. Consistently, overexpression of GPR116 in MCF-7 cells and 293T cells increased the
activity of RhoA and Rac1, but not of Cdc42 (Fig. 3E and

GPR116 Promotes Metastases through Gaq Pathway

RhoA and Rac1 activity is independent of cell type. To further
conﬁrm the effect of GPR116 on RhoA and Rac1 activity, we
examined the phosphorylation of MLC-2 and coﬁlin, which is
induced by the activation of small GTPases. As shown in Fig. 3F,
knockdown of GPR116 signiﬁcantly reduced the phosphorylation of MLC-2 and coﬁlin in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells.
Similar results were obtained from sections of MDA-MB-231
metastases in mice. Compared with control mouse metastases,
knockdown of GPR116 inhibited the phosphorylation of coﬁlin
(Fig. 3G).
To examine whether GPR116-mediated breast cancer cell
migration is dependent on RhoA and Rac1, we overexpressed
constitutively active mutants of RhoA or Rac1 in GPR116knockdown breast cancer cells. As shown in Fig. 3H and I,
knockdown of GPR116 suppressed breast cancer cell migration, whereas ectopic expression of active mutant RhoA and
Rac1 partially restored cell migration (Fig. 3H and I), suggesting that GPR116-mediated breast cancer cell migration is
RhoA- and Rac1-dependent.
To determine whether RhoA and Rac1 are directly
involved in GPR116 mediated formation of cell lamellipodia
and stress ﬁbers, we investigated whether overexpression
of RhoA or Rac1 in GPR116-knockdown cells could rescue
lamellipodium and stress ﬁber formation. As shown in
Supplementary Fig. S6, knockdown of GPR116 reduced stress
ﬁber formation and induced an elongated cell shape in MDAMB-231 breast cancer cells, whereas overexpression of constitutively active mutant RhoA rescued the stress ﬁber
formation in GPR116-knockdown cells and overexpression
of constitutively active mutant Rac1 promoted strong lamellipodia formation in GPR116-knockdown cells. And both
mutants partially rescued the elongated cell shape phenotype (Supplementary Fig. S6), indicating that the regulation
of actin stress ﬁber and lamellipodia formation by GPR116 is
RhoA- and Rac1-dependent.
GPR116 regulates RhoA and Rac1 activity by coupling to
Gaq/11
Previous studies suggest that Ga12/13 and Gaq/11 are the
2 most common Ga proteins directly activating Rho family
GTPases to regulate cell migration and morphology (25–28).
We ﬁrst examined whether GPR116 regulates RhoA and Rac1
activity through Ga12/13 or Gaq/11. In GPR116-overexpressing 293T cells, we co-expressed GPR116 with the regulator
of G-protein signaling 2 (RGS2) or RGS domains of p115RhoGEF, which selectively block the activity of Gaq/11 or Ga12/
13, respectively (29, 30), and then examined the activation
of RhoA and Rac1. Our data showed that the expression of
RGS2, which blocks Gaq/11 activation, abrogated the activation of RhoA and Rac1 induced by GPR116 (Fig. 4A),
whereas expression of the RGS domain of p115RhoGEF,
which blocks Ga12/13 activation, had little effect on the
activation of RhoA and Rac1 (Supplementary Fig. S7A).
Moreover, knockdown of Gaq/11 blunted the GPR116dependent activation of RhoA and Rac1 (Fig. 4B). In addition, the C-terminal domain of the Gaq protein (Gq CT)
markedly attenuated GPR116 induced activation of RhoA
and Rac1 (Supplementary Fig. S7B; refs. 6, 31). Finally,

www.aacrjournals.org

according to a sequence analysis using the bioinformatics
prediction tool (32), we found that GPR116 would only
couple to Gaq/11. Taken together, these data suggest that
the activation of RhoA and Rac1 by GPR116 is Gaq/11dependent. To further conﬁrm this result, we overexpressed
a constitutively active mutant of Gaq (CA Gq; ref. 33) in
GPR116-knockdown MDA-MB-231 cells. As shown in Fig. 4C,
knockdown of GPR116 reduced the activation of RhoA and
Rac1, whereas expression of CA Gq completely restored the
activity of RhoA and Rac1 disrupted by the GPR116 knockdown. These results showed that the regulation of RhoA and
Rac1 by GPR116 is Gaq-dependent.
To determine whether GPR116 regulation of breast cancer
cell migration and morphology is dependent on Gaq, we
expressed CA Gq in GPR116-knockdown cells. Expression of
CA Gq rescued cell migration (Fig. 4D) as well as cell morphology in GPR116-knockdown MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 4E).
These results indicated that GPR116 regulation of breast
cancer cell migration is Gaq-dependent.
Regulation of RhoA and Rac1 activity by GPR116 is
through p63RhoGEF
Gaq coupling to p63RhoGEF is important for GPCRmediated RhoA activation (6, 33, 34). In addition, p63RhoGEF/GEFT has been reported to activate Rac1 and mediate
tumorigenesis, tumor metastasis, and myogenesis (8, 35, 36).
To investigate whether p63RhoGEF is required for the activation of RhoA and Rac1 in breast cancer cells, we overexpressed p63RhoGEF in MDA-MB-231 cells. Our data showed that p63RhoGEF activated both RhoA and Rac1 in breast
cancer cells (Fig. 4F and Supplementary Fig. S8A). To further
examine whether p63RhoGEF is required for GPR116-mediated activation of RhoA and Rac1, we overexpressed a catalytic domain–deleted mutant p63RhoGEF (p63RhoGEF DN)
in GPR116-overexpressing 293T cells. Our results showed that
p63RhoGEF DN signiﬁcantly abrogated the GTPase activation
induced by GPR116 (Fig. 4G and Supplementary Fig. S8B),
suggesting that GPR116 regulation of RhoA and Rac1 activity
is p63RhoGEF-dependent.
GPR116 is associated with malignant breast cancer in
humans
To further investigate the biologic signiﬁcance of GPR116 in
breast cancer, we used 3 separate approaches to analyze the
expression of GPR116 in patient samples. First, we analyzed the
mRNA expression trend of GPR116 by 2 gene expression
datasets, GDS2250 and GDS2415, from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). As shown in Fig. 5A, the gene expression trend of
GPR116 was signiﬁcantly upregulated in breast tumors (n ¼
47) and recurrent tumors (n ¼ 59) compared with normal
tissue (Fig. 5A, top) and no recurrent tumor (Fig. 5A, bottom),
respectively. Second, using immunohistochemistry, we examined the protein expression of GPR116 in human breast cancer
tissues (n ¼ 490) and in normal human breast tissues (n ¼ 67).
Consistent with mRNA expression analysis, most of the normal
breast tissues had no signal or pale staining of GPR116 protein
(Fig. 5B and C and Table 1); however, the staining of GPR116
protein remarkably increased with progression through

prognostic value of GPR116 expression in breast cancer by

Discussion
In the present study, we identiﬁed GPR116 as a regulator of
breast cancer metastasis through screening the adhesion
GPCR family. GPR116 regulates breast cancer cell migration
and invasion in both highly and poorly metastatic breast
cancer cells and modulated the formation of actin stress ﬁbers
and lamellipodia through the Gaq-p63RhoGEF-Rho GTPase
signaling pathway. Moreover, loss of GPR116 largely inhibited
breast cancer metastasis in 2 mouse metastasis models. Furthermore, by examining human breast cancer tissues and
clinicopathologic parameters, we found that the expression
of GPR116 is signiﬁcantly associated with tumor stage, metastasis, and poor prognosis, providing pathologic support for the
biologic function of this receptor in vitro and in vivo.
We also clariﬁed the molecular mechanism how GPR116
regulates breast cancer cell migration. First, we found that

6216

Cancer Res; 73(20) October 15, 2013

downregulation of GPR116 markedly decreased the activity of
the small GTPases RhoA and Rac1, but not Cdc42. Conversely,
ectopic expression of GPR116 in MCF-7 and 293T cells led to
activation of RhoA and Rac1, but not Cdc42. We further
showed that RhoA and Rac1 were responsible for GPR116induced cancer cell migration and morphology changes. Previous studies have shown that RhoA and Rac1 regulate the
formation of an elongated cell morphology in macrophages
(37) and regulate the motility of diverse tumor cells (38–40),
which are consistent with our observations. Second, we found
that GPR116 promoted breast cancer cell migration and invasion via Gaq signaling. We showed that inhibiting Gaq in
GPR116-overexpressing cells signiﬁcantly blocked RhoA and
Rac1 activation and ectopically expressing a constitutively
active mutant of Gaq markedly rescued the signaling and cell
phenotype in GPR116-knockdown breast cancer cells. Third,

GPR116 Promotes Metastases through Gaq Pathway

p63RhoGEF, an important Gaq effector, has been reported to
mediate RhoA, Rac1, or Cdc42 activation in different cell types
(35, 41, 42). Our data showed that GPR116 mediated RhoA and
Rac1 activation by Gaq and p63RhoGEF signaling.
Our observations indicate that GPR116 was involved in
breast cancer metastasis regulation through the classical
Ga protein–mediated signaling pathway. Previous reports
have shown that some adhesion GPCRs are associated with
tumor progression, such as EMR2 in breast cancer (43),
GPR56 in pancreatic cancer and glioblastoma (44, 45), and
CD97 in thyroid and colorectal cancer (28, 46). Interestingly,
adhesion GPCRs frequently signal through Ga proteins.
GPR56 has been reported to couple to Ga12/13 and Gaq/11
(25, 27), GPR133 couples to Gas, and CD97 couples to
Ga12/13 (28, 47). Our study supports the idea that adhesion
GPCRs also activate the classical receptor/G-protein signaling pathway.
During cell migration, Rac1 and RhoA have a reciprocal
feedback interaction over controlling the plasticity of cell
migration. Activated Rac1 has been shown to inhibit RhoA
activity by the Rac1 downstream effector WAVE2 (4). RhoA
also inhibits the activity of Rac1 through regulating the RacGAP (Rac GTPase–activating protein) ARHGA22 (4). In our
study, we showed that GPR116 regulated cancer cell migration
and metastasis by activating both RhoA and Rac1. Though
the precise molecular mechanism still remains to be elucidated, there are several facets to interpreting this conﬂict.
First, p63RhoGEF has been shown to activate different small
GTPases including RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 in different cell
types (35, 41, 42), suggesting that GPR116 regulates both RhoA
and Rac1 via the activation of p63RhoGEF in breast cancer
cells. Second, it has been reported that at the leading edge,
activated RhoA antagonizes Rac1 during cell migration. Therefore, during cell migration, how GPR116 spatiotemporally
regulates RhoA and Rac1 will need further investigation.
Last, both RhoA and Rac1 have high expression and activity
levels in breast cancer (4). It is reasonable to speculate about
the existence of a common signaling pathway that enhances
the expression and activity of both RhoA and Rac1 in breast
cancer. In fact, previous studies have shown that Ras can activate Rac1 (48), which can, in turn, activate RhoA (49).
Overexpression of GPR116-induced breast cancer cell migration and stimulated the activation of RhoA and Rac1. And

rat GPR116 has been reported to form dimers and to be
processed multiple times to generate several fragments (15),
which suggested that the cleaved fragments of GPR116 may
function as ligands. Our results also showed that GPR116 is
strongly correlated with human breast cancer progression,
metastasis, and poor prognosis and its expression even starts
in benign breast lumps. Therefore, GPR116 may serve as a biomarker for breast cancer diagnosis through detecting the
cleaved fragments in body ﬂuid using appropriate antibodies.
In conclusion, for the ﬁrst time, we show that GPR116 plays a
critical role in promoting breast cancer progression and
metastasis through coupling to Gaq and the p63RhoGEFRhoA/Rac1 signaling pathway. Furthermore, the strong correlation between the expression of GPR116 and breast cancer
malignancy supports its role as a metastasis promoter in
humans. Therefore, GPR116 could be used as a potential
therapeutic target and diagnostic marker for breast cancers.
