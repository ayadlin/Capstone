ABSTRACT
Inhibition of Hsp90 can increase the radiosensitivity of tumor cells. However,
inhibition of Hsp90 alone induces the anti-apoptotic Hsp70 and thereby decreases
radiosensitivity. Therefore, preventing Hsp70 induction can be a promising strategy for
radiosensitization. PI-103, an inhibitor of PI3K and mTOR, has previously been shown
to suppress the up-regulation of Hsp70. Here, we explore the impact of combining
PI-103 with the Hsp90 inhibitor NVP-AUY922 in irradiated glioblastoma and colon
carcinoma cells. We analyzed the cellular response to drug-irradiation treatments by
colony-forming assay, expression of several marker proteins, cell cycle progression
and induction/repair of DNA damage. Although PI-103, given 24 h prior to irradiation,
slightly suppressed the NVP-AUY922-mediated up-regulation of Hsp70, it did not cause
radiosensitization and even diminished the radiosensitizing effect of NVP-AUY922.
This result can be explained by the activation of PI3K and ERK pathways along with
G1-arrest at the time of irradiation. In sharp contrast, PI-103 not only exerted a
radiosensitizing effect but also strongly enhanced the radiosensitization by NVPAUY922 when both inhibitors were added 3 h before irradiation and kept in culture for
24 h. Possible reasons for the observed radiosensitization under this drug-irradiation
schedule may be a down-regulation of PI3K and ERK pathways during or directly after
irradiation, increased residual DNA damage and strong G2/M arrest 24 h thereafter.
We conclude that duration of drug treatment before irradiation plays a key role in the
concomitant targeting of PI3K/mTOR and Hsp90 in tumor cells.

INTRODUCTION

AKT, and ErbB2 proteins [5, 6], which are associated with
protection against radiation-induced cell death [7, 8].
Considering the above mentioned functions
of Hsp90, its inhibition can be a promising strategy
for implementing a multi-target approach to
radiosensitization. Indeed, a number of studies have
already explored Hsp90 as a potential molecular target
for tumor cells’ radiosensitization [9–11]. Thus, various
geldanamycin (17-DMAG or 17-AAG) or ansamycin
derivatives (NVP-AUY922 or NVP-BEP800) significantly

Heat shock proteins 90 (Hsp90s) are ubiquitously
and abundantly expressed polypeptides required for the
energy-driven stabilization, conformation and function of
a large number of cellular proteins, termed Hsp90 clients
[1, 2]. Among many functions, Hsp90 clients contribute
to the pathways involved in the induction of mitogenactivated protein kinases (MAPK) and nuclear factorkappa B (NF-kB) [3, 4]. Hsp90 also stabilizes Raf-1,

enhance the radiosensitivity of tumor cell lines derived
from a variety of histologies, including glioma, prostate,
and lung carcinoma [9–11].
At the same time, Hsp90 inhibition can induce
up-regulation of Hsp90 itself along with its major
co-chaperone Hsp70 [10, 12], which is known to promote
cell survival by inhibiting both caspase-dependent and
independent apoptotic pathways [13]. As a result, the antiapoptotic action of heat shock proteins will reduce the
radiosensitizing effect of Hsp90 inhibitors.
The up-regulation of Hsp90/Hsp70 levels can be
temporarily suppressed by silencing gene expression via
the introduction of synthetic siRNA into cells. However,
neither pre-silencing of Hsp90 nor that of Hsp70 increases
the radiosensitizing effect of the Hsp90 inhibitor NVPAUY922 [14]. Alternatively, the induction of Hsp70 after
pharmacological Hsp90 inhibition can be suppressed by
concomitant PI3K inhibition with the pyridofuropyrimidine
PI-103, a dual PI3K and mTOR inhibitor [15].
In the present study, we examined the ability
of PI-103 to enhance the radiosensitizing effect of
NVP-AUY922 in four tumor cell lines, including the
glioblastoma GaMG and SNB19, and the colon carcinoma
SW480 and SW48 cell lines. To this end, we analyzed
control, drug-treated and irradiated cells by viability and
colony-forming assays, induction and repair of radiationand drug-induced DNA damage and cell-cycle distribution.
We also assessed by Western blotting the expression levels
of several marker proteins (Hsp90, Hsp70, PI3K, p-AKT,
p-mTOR, p-4EBP1, p-S6, Raf-1, p-ERK1/2 etc.).

tumor cell lines. In Schedule I, either PI-103 or NVPAUY922, or both inhibitors were added to cell cultures for
24 h before IR (Supplementary Figure S2). In Schedule II,
the inhibitors were added to cells 3 h before IR and kept in
culture medium up to 24 h post-IR. The effects of drugs on
Hsp90/Hsp70 expression and cell survival were analyzed
by Western blotting and colony-forming assay, respectively.
Figure 1A shows representative Western blots
of Hsp90 and Hsp70 expressed in four tumor cell lines
treated either with PI-103 or NVP-AUY922, or both
substances for 24 h before IR according to Schedule I. As
evident from the Figure, PI-103 alone exerted little (if any)
effect on the expression levels of Hsp90 and Hsp70, as
compared to untreated control. In contrast, treatment with
the Hsp90 inhibitor NVP-AUY922 considerably increased
the levels of Hsp70 (and to lesser extents of Hsp90) in all
tested cell lines. For example, in NVP-AUY922-treated
SNB19 cells, the expression of Hsp70 increased 4.5-fold,
i.e. from the control level 0.6 to 2.7 a.u.
With the intention to prevent the up-regulation of
Hsp70 induced by Hsp90 inhibition, we treated tumor
cells simultaneously with NVP-AUY922 and PI-103 for
24 h according to Schedule I. As expected, concomitant
treatment with two inhibitors suppressed to some extent the
induction of Hsp90 and Hsp70 in all tested cell lines with
respect to NVP-AUY922-treated samples (Figure 1A).
However, the suppressive effect of PI-103 on the Hsp90/
Hsp70 proteins was relatively weak in all tested cell lines.
On average, Hsp90/Hsp70 expression in cells treated
simultaneously with two substances was only by ~10–20%
lower than in the corresponding samples treated with
NVP-AUY922 alone.
We further analyzed whether the diminished upregulation of Hsp90/Hsp70 in the presence of PI-103 and
NVP-AUY922 affected the radiation sensitivity of tumor
cells. Figure 1B shows the normalized survival responses
of control and drug-treated cells plotted versus the radiation
dose, along with the best fit curves of the LQ model
(Equation 1) to the data. The plating efficiencies (PE)
of non-irradiated cell samples, as well as the fitted parameters
derived with the LQ model, including the surviving fraction
at 2 Gy (SF2), the radiation dose required to reduce colony
forming ability by 90% (D10) and the growth inhibition
factor (I10) are summarized in Supplementary Table S1.
Contrary to the expectation, the combined treatment
with PI-103 and NVP-AUY922 (Figure 1B, curves 4 for
each cell line) according to Schedule I even slightly reduced
the radiosensitizing effect of NVP-AUY922 (curves 3) in 2
(GaMG and SW48) out of 4 tested cell lines. Interestingly,
PI-103 alone did not induce any radiosensitization in all
tested cells lines, as evident from the closely overlapping
curves 2 and 1 (control) in Figure 1B.
Since the reduced up-regulation of Hsp90/Hsp70
by PI-103 did not enhance the radiosensitizing ability
of NVP-AUY922 under the conditions of Schedule I
(Figure 1), we further attempted to completely avoid the
drug-mediated up-regulation of Hsp90/Hsp70. To this

RESULTS
Cytotoxicity of PI-103 and NVP-AUY922
The cytotoxicity of PI-103 within the concentration
range 0.01 – 20 µM in the presence of 200 nM NVPAUY922 against non-irradiated tumor cells was studied
by an ATP-based assay. The cellular ATP levels in cell
samples treated with the drugs for 24 h were normalized
against DMSO-treated controls and plotted versus PI-103
concentration (Supplementary Figure S1). With increasing
PI-103 concentration, the mean ATP content in all cell lines
decreased steadily depending on the cell line to 30–70%
of the initial level after combined drug exposure. Based
on these measurements, 2 µM of PI-103, causing 20–50%
viability loss, was used for subsequent experiments.
The selected PI-103 concentration is consistent with the
previously reported data [15].

Impact of PI-103 and NVP-AUY922 on Hsp90/
Hsp70 expression and colony survival after

radiation on multiple signaling pathways

end, we reduced the duration of drug treatment from 24 h
(Schedule I) to 3 h before IR (Schedule II, Supplementary
Figure S2). As seen from the Western blot detections in
Figure 2A, the shorter exposure of cells to both inhibitors
caused only little, if any, changes in the expression of
Hsp90/Hsp70 proteins, with respect to control samples.
At the same time, under this schedule, PI-103 moderately
increased (Figure 2B, solid curves 4) the radiosensitizing
effect of NVP-AUY922 (curves 3) in all tested cell
lines. The enhancement of radiosensitization is also
evident from the markedly reduced SF2 and D10 values
(Supplementary Table S2) in irradiated cells treated with
both drugs. Moreover, in contrast to a 24-h incubation, a
3-h treatment with PI-103 alone increased the radiation
sensitivities of all tested cell lines (Figure 2B, curves 2),
as compared to controls (curves 1). As seen in Figure 2C,
the enhanced radiosensitization by a combination of drugs
was independent of either p53 or PTEN mutational status
of the cell lines tested.

To elucidate the molecular basis for the observed
schedule-dependent responses of drug-treated tumor
cells to IR (Figures 1B, 2B), we analyzed the expression
of several relevant marker proteins. Figure 3 shows
exemplarily the Western blot data of control and drugtreated SNB19 cells probed for PI3K (p110α), pAKT,
pmTOR, p-S6 and p4EBP1 and other indicated proteins
30 min after IR with 8 Gy. Samples shown on the leftand right-hand sides (LHS, RHS) of Figure 3 were treated
according to Schedule I and II, respectively. The data for
the other 3 tested cell lines at 30 min post-IR are shown in
Supplementary Figures S3–S5.
As seen in Figure 3 (LHS column), a 24-h incubation
with PI-103 substantially increased the expression of PI3K
in SNB19 cells (i.e. from 1.2 to 1.5 a.u.), whereas upon a
3-h drug treatment using Schedule II (RHS of Figure 3) the

shown in part B derived from at least three independent experiments for each cell line in quadruplicate were pooled together and fitted
by a LQ equation (Equation 1). The SD values are indicated by error bars. (Take note of the positions of curves 3 and 4). Student’s t-test
was conducted and considered significant at p < 0.05 (*), p < 0.01 (**), where the symbols * and # represent significant difference when
compared either to vehicle or NVP-AUY922, respectively.

PI3K level remained practically unchanged (1.6–1.7 a.u.).
At the same time, the expression of p-AKT was strongly
reduced from 0.7 a.u. in control to 0.1 a.u. in PI-103treated sample after a 3-h drug treatment under Schedule
II, with and without IR. In contrast, a 24-h treatment with
PI-103 caused reactivation of the AKT function [16],
i.e. p-AKT expression in both non-irradiated (0.6 a.u.)
and irradiated (0.54 a.u.) samples almost recovered to
the background level of ~0.7 a.u. (Figure 3, LHS). A
24-h treatment with the Hsp90 inhibitor alone reduced
(~2 times) the expression of p-AKT (to 0.3–0.4 a.u.),
whereas the combined treatment with both inhibitors for
24 h almost depleted p-AKT (~0.1 a.u.) independent of
IR. After a short 3-h incubation with NVP-AUY922 alone,
the expression levels of p-AKT and PI3K were almost
unchanged as compared to the corresponding controls.

In addition to PI3K, we analyzed the expression of
p-mTOR (a further target of PI-103) and its downstreams,
ribosomal S6 and translational repressor 4EBP1
proteins, which are known to influence the cell-cycle
progression and cell growth [17, 18]. The expression
of p-mTOR was moderately increased after a 24-h
incubation with PI-103 alone (Figure 3, LHS), but it
was almost unchanged or even slightly reduced after a
3-h exposure to PI-103 in the cell sample treated with
both substances for 3 h. Addition of the Hsp90 inhibitor
alone or in combination with PI-103 under Schedule I
(24-h treatment) strongly decreased or even depleted
(~0–0.2 a.u.) the expression of p-mTOR. As a result, the
pS6 protein was also strongly suppressed or depleted
30 minutes post-IR under both schedules (Figure 3
and Supplementary Figures S3–S5) in cells treated with

PI-103 alone or in combination with NVP-AUY922.
In contrast, expression of p-4E-BP1 was reduced to a much
lesser extent (Figure 3 and Supplementary Figures S3–S5)
and only after concomitant treatment with both substances,
but also independent of the treatment schedule.
The lack of PTEN in PTEN-mutated cells, such as
SNB19, usually leads to a compensatory activation of
the PI3K pathway. Thus, activation of AKT in SNB19
cells typically results in an inhibition of Raf-1 and its

downstreams MEK and ERK proteins through a cross-talk
between the PI3K/AKT/mTOR and Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK
(ERK signaling) pathways [19]. Besides this, as a result
of Hsp90 inhibition, depletion of AKT can alter the ERK
pathway. Normally the ERK pathway transmits signals
from cell surface receptors to promote proliferation and
survival programs, and it is frequently mutated in cancer
cells [20, 21]. In fact, we found that a 24-h incubation
with NVP-AUY922 alone or in combination with PI-103

reduced the expressions of Raf-1, p-ERK and pMEK
(Figure 3 and Supplementary Figures S3–S5), which
are known clients of Hsp90 protein, in all cell lines
independent of IR. Interestingly, a 3-h incubation with
PI-103 increased the expression of p-MEK1/2 after IR
in most (except SW48) cell lines studied here. Another
unexpected result was the up-regulation of Raf-1 in
SW480 cells treated with PI-103 alone (Supplementary
Figure S4). The most probable explanation for this result
is that SW480 cells contain a mutation in kRas, which is
directly implicated in the ERK signaling axis as well as in
the PI3K pathway [22].
The next important finding was an increased
expression of p-MEK1/2 in SNB19 (Figure 3) and GaMG
(Supplementary Figure S3) cells which were pretreated
for 3 h with the Hsp90 inhibitor alone, or in the presence
of PI-103. The activation of MEK/ERK pathway by Hsp90
inhibition was also observed in several other studies [23, 24].
Analysis of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-xL
revealed that a prolonged treatment (24 h) with the
inhibitors (used either alone or in combination) caused
a moderate up-regulation of Bcl-xL in SNB19 (Figure 3)
as well as in GaMG and SW48 cell lines (Supplementary
Figures S3, S5).
The Western blots of several cell cycle regulatory
proteins, including cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdk1 and
Cdk4) and pRb are illustrated for SNB19 cells in Figure 3.
In the absence of inhibitors, irradiation of SNB19 cells
(Figure 3) with 8 Gy resulted in a down-regulation of pRb
and Cdk1 proteins after a 24-h pretreatment (Figure 3,
LHS), without affecting their expression after a 3-h
incubation period (Figure 3, RHS). It is also evident that a
24-h exposure to NVP-AUY922 alone and in combination
with PI-103 caused a significant down-regulation of pRb,
Cdk4 and Cdk1 proteins in non-irradiated SNB19 cells. In
general, changes induced by combined drug-IR treatments
were similar to those observed without IR, under both
treatment schedules. Down-regulation of the G1/S
regulatory protein Cdk4 was less pronounced in SNB19
(Figure 3) and GaMG (Supplementary Figure S3) cells,
as compared to SW480 and SW48 cells (Supplementary
Figures S4, S5). Cdk1 protein was decreased (GaMG,
SNB19 and SW48) or even completely abolished (SW480)
after Hsp90 inhibition alone or in combination with PI103 after a 24-h pre-treatment (Schedule I). In contrast,
a short incubation with the drugs (i.e. 3 h, Schedule II)
did not significantly affect the expression of cell cycleassociated proteins, i.e. 30 min post-IR the expression of
these proteins in irradiated cells was similar to that in nonirradiated samples.
In addition to the Western blot analysis performed
30 min post-IR, the above mentioned marker proteins
were also detected at 24 h post-IR (Figure 4 and
Supplementary Figures S6–S8). As seen in Figure 4, the
striking difference between two schedules (24-h versus
3-h drug pre-treatment) in the expression of p-AKT and
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

p-S6 in PI-103-treated cells observed at 30 min after
IR (Figure 3) disappeared 24 h post-IR (Figure 4). The
expression patterns of other tested proteins at 24 h after
IR were similar under both schedules, i.e. they were
either suppressed (p-4E-BP1, Cdk1, Cdk4) or completely
depleted (p-AKT, p-S6, Raf-1, p-ERK, etc.) after treatment
with NVP-AUY922 alone or in combination with PI-103.
PI-103 alone strongly decreased the levels of p-S6
and p-4E-BP1 proteins. At the same time, PI-103 only
moderately decreased the expression of the main proteins
of the ERK-pathway, including Raf-1 and p-ERK.
The effects of PI-103 and NVP-AUY922 on the
expression of most marker proteins in GaMG, SW480 and
SW48 cell lines (Supplementary Figures S6–S8) at 24 h
post-IR were qualitatively similar (except for the cellcycle relevant proteins) to those observed in SNB19 cells
under both schedules (Figure 4).
In addition, we detected the expression of nonphosphorylated forms of AKT, mTOR, and other proteins.
As seen in Supplementary Figures S9–S16, contrary
to the phosphorylated forms, the expression of nonphosphorylated forms of AKT, mTOR, 4E-BP1 and
S6 was only moderately repressed after addition of the
inhibitors. At the same time, the expression of MEK and
ERK proteins was not changed at all.

Assessment of late-stage apoptosis
In efforts to identify the mechanisms underlying the
increased radiation sensitivity of tumor cells after combined
PI3K/mTOR/Hsp90-inhibition shown in Figure 2B,
we also examined the expression of cleaved PARP, an
established pro-apoptotic marker. Figure 5A–5H show
exemplarily the expression of uncleaved and cleaved
PARP in non-irradiated or irradiated cell samples detected
24 h after IR, either untreated or treated with inhibitors
under both schedules. Increased levels of cleaved PARP
were found under Schedule I in all cell lines treated with
NVP-AUY922 alone or in a combination with PI-103
independent of IR. The extents of cleaved PARP induction,
however, varied markedly among the 4 tested cell lines. The
highest levels of cleaved PARP were observed in SW480
and SW48 cell lines (Figure 5C and 5D, respectively).
Representative Western blots from at least 3 experiments
are summarized in parts I-P of Figure 5. As seen in
the bottom part of Figure 5, under Schedule II only 2
(GaMG and SW48) out of 4 tested cell lines showed
apoptosis.

Induction and decay of histone γH2AX
The induction of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs),
detected by the expression of phosphorylated histone
H2AX [25], was measured 30 min and 24 h (Figure 6) after
irradiation of tumor cells, non-treated or pre-treated with
inhibitors (Figure 6 and Supplementary Figures S17–S19).

As evident from the representative flow cytograms
(Supplementary Figure S17), the degree of the radiationinduced DNA damage in the colon carcinoma SW480
cells treated with PI-103 was even lower than in DMSOtreated controls under Schedule I (Figure S17A). Thus, 30
min after IR, PI-103-treated and irradiated SW480 cells
exhibited even less DNA damage (2005 a.u. of γH2AX,
Figure S17A) than did the corresponding irradiated
drug-free controls (2408 a.u.). The highest DNA damage
(3144 a.u.) was induced by NVP-AUY922 and IR,
whereas a combination of substances caused less DNA

damage (2327 a.u.) that was similar to that of the drugfree sample. Both substances given simultaneously under
Schedule I did not noticeably affect the DNA damage
repair process in SW480 tumor cells (Figure S17B), as
suggested by the rapid reduction of γH2AX observed 24 h
after IR (1709 a.u.), which was comparable to that in
control (1523 a.u.).
On the other hand, if a combination of both
substances was added according to Schedule II, the
unrepaired DNA damage (Figures S17C, S17D) was
much higher (~3100 a.u.) than in drug-free (~2500 a.u.)

cells (Figure S17D). Moreover, although under Schedule
II the initial levels of DNA damage 30 min after IR were
similar in all samples (3800 ± 200 a.u., Figure S17C), the
cells treated with NVP-AUY922 alone or in combination
with PI-103 exhibited much higher residual γH2AX levels

(~3500 and ~3100 a.u., respectively) 24 h after IR, as
compared to the DNA damage levels in drug-free controls
(~2500 a.u., Figure S17D). Latter findings suggest a
negative impact of the inhibitors given under Schedule II
on the DNA repair mechanisms.

As seen in Supplementary Figure S17, NVPAUY922-treated tumor cell samples exhibited two distinct

subpopulations (responding and non-responding to the
drug) differing markedly in their γH2AX expression, as

well as in the amounts of cells in each subpopulation.
Given that all cell lines used here had similar cell-cycle
distributions before drug treatment, the γH2AX expression
mediated by the drugs alone (without IR) was more cell
line-specific rather than associated with the cell cycle.
The representative experiments illustrated in
Supplementary Figure S17 for GaMG cell line were
repeated for each cell line at least 3 times. The results
are summarized in Figure 6 as the mean (± SD) values
of the degree of DNA damage 30 min and 24 h post-IR
in all samples measured under both schedules. As seen in
Figure 6, in most cell lines tested (except SW48) the
residual damage to DNA after IR and addition of NVPAUY922 alone or in a combination with PI-103 was much
higher than that in drug-free irradiated cells.
As requested by the Referee, we made additional
experiments using a much lower radiation dose of 2 Gy
(Supplementary Figures S18, S19) and detected the
expression of γH2AX. As seen in Supplementary Figures
S18, S19, the radiation dose of 2 Gy induced much less
DNA damage, which also was repaired much faster, as
compared to cells irradiated with 8 Gy (Figure 6). The
data are in agreement with the colony-survival curves
presented in Figures 1B and 2B.
Prompted by the observation that both substances
given under Schedule II compromised the DNA repair in
irradiated cells, we analyzed the expression of the DNA
repair protein Rad51. Recently, the expression of this
protein has been found to be abrogated by a different PI3K
and mTOR inhibitor, NVP-BEZ235 [26, 27]. Figure 7
shows representative Western blot detections of Rad51
protein in 4 cell lines treated with drugs and IR according
to both schedules. Thirty minutes after IR, Rad51 was
reduced in samples treated with NVP-AUY922 alone or
in combination with PI-103 under Schedule I. Twenty four
hours post-IR the protein was reduced also under Schedule
II after Hsp90 inhibition. In contrast to the published data
on NVP-BEZ235 [26, 27], we found that PI-103 alone
suppressed the expression of Rad51 only in 2 (GaMG
and SW480) out of 4 tested cell lines (Figure 7). This
means that the impaired DNA repair capacity revealed by
the high residual histone γH2AX levels observed under
Schedule II in the majority of cell lines tested cannot be
explained by the depletion of Rad51 (Figure 7).

all tested cell lines are shown in Supplementary Figure S20.
The large portions of cells in the S- and G2/M-phases
in non-irradiated control cells in Figure 8 prove that
the cell culture was in the exponential growth phase at
the beginning of experiments. A 24-h incubation with
PI-103 caused an enrichment of G1 phase cells from
40–50% to 60–70%. On the contrary, upon a 24-h
incubation with the NVP-AUY922, the G2/G1 ratio
increased from 0.4 in control cells to 4.3 (Figure 8,
top half) whereas after combined treatment with both
inhibitors it was lower (2.5) but still much higher
than in control. Thirty minutes post-IR, non-irradiated
and irradiated cells (within a particular treatment
condition) exhibited similar G2/G1 ratios (Figure 8,
first versus second raw). Twenty four hours post-IR, nontreated irradiated GaMG cells showed a G2/M arrest (G2/G1
ratio of 1.4), which was higher than that in the presence
of PI-103 (G2/G1 = 1.0). In the presence of both inhibitors,
the G2/G1 ratio in irradiated cells was about 2.2 which was
much lower than that in the presence of NVP-AUY922
alone (4.6).
In case of Schedule II (Figure 8, bottom half),
30 min after IR the cell-cycle histograms of non-treated
and drug-treated cells were very similar, independent of
IR exposure. A G2/M arrest was observed 24 h after IR
in the irradiated samples of all cell lines (Supplementary
Figure S20). Interestingly, although a 24-h incubation with
PI-103 alone caused a strong G1 arrest, together with IR
under Schedule II, PI-103 caused a massive G2/M arrest
in the most of tested cell lines and especially in SNB19
cells (Supplementary Figure S20B). As expected, NVPAUY922 caused S-phase depletion and G2/M arrest
independent of IR.
To sum up, a 24-h incubation with PI-103 caused
a G1 arrest, but together with IR the inhibitor produced
a massive G2/M arrest. A combined treatment with both
drugs caused a strong G2/M arrest 24 h post-IR in tumor
cells irradiated under both schedules, however, to a lesser
extent than did Hsp90 inhibition alone.

DISCUSSION
Clinicians have combined chemotherapy and
radiation therapy since the 1980s [28] and the combination
of radiation and concurrent chemo- or molecularly targeted
therapy has been convincingly shown to be superior to
radiation alone in treatment of several cancer forms [29].
A number of anticancer agents including several
inhibitors of Hsp90 are known to synergistically enhance
the cytotoxicity of IR. Numerous studies, including our
own, have already explored Hsp90 as a potential target
for tumor cells’ radiosensitization [9–11]. A major
drawback of Hsp90 inhibition, however, is that it causes
up-regulation of Hsp90 itself and his major co-chaperone
Hsp70, thereby promoting cell survival by inhibition of
caspase-dependent and –independent cell death [13].

Effects of PI-103, NVPAUY922 and IR on cellcycle progression
In the following experiments, we analyzed the
impact of drugs and IR on the cell-cycle progression
as a possible mechanism responsible for the enhanced
radiosensitization induced by the combined drug
treatment under Schedule II (Figure 2B). Figure 8 shows
representative cell cycle histograms for GaMG cells
treated under Schedule I (Figure 8 top half) and Schedule
II (Figure 8 bottom half), whereas the summarized data for

Based on our data, no conclusions can be drawn
whether the radiosensitizing effect of PI-103 alone or in
a combination with NVP-AUY922 is dependent on the
mutational status of PTEN or p53, because among the four
tested cell lines only one was PTEN mutated (SNB19),
and one (SW48) was p53 wild type (Figure 2C), yet the
effect was observed in all tested cell lines.
In a recent study, PI-103 exhibited a somewhat
stronger radiosensitizing effect (enhancement ratio,
E.R. = 1.41) in the PTEN mutated U251 cells than in the
PTEN wild-type T98G cells (E.R. = 1.26) [38]. However,
the PTEN mutated U87-MG line showed in the same study
a much lower E.R. of ~1.05 than T98G cells [38]. So a
possible correlation between the sensitivity of tumor cells
to the PI-103 and their PTEN or p53 status needs further
investigation.
In order to elucidate the striking difference in the
radiosensitizing effects between two drug-IR schedules
reported here (Figure 1B versus Figure 2B), we
examined the expression of Hsp90/Hsp70, several key
proteins of the PI3K and ERK pathways (Figures 3, 4
and Supplementary Figures S3-S16), the degree of
apoptosis (Figure 5), induction and repair of DNA
damage (Figures 6,7 and Supplementary Figures S17–19),
and cell-cycle distribution (Figure 8, Supplementary
Figure S20) for either schedule. Based on these data we
proposed a simplified model illustrated in Figure 9. In
addition, Supplementary Figure S21 summarizes the main
differences between both treatment schedules.
Our Western blot analysis revealed that the shortterm (3 h) pretreatment with PI-103 caused a depletion of
the phosphorylated form of AKT in 2 out of 4 cell lines
studied here (Figure 3 RHS and Supplementary Figures
S3–S5). In contrast, the long-term (24 h) incubation with
the PI-103 led to a reactivation of AKT activity (Figure 3
LHS, and Supplementary Figures S6–S8). The reactivation
of AKT suggests the interruption of the negative feedback
loops that normally down-regulate PI3K signaling, which
in turn can paradoxically promote cell survival, as reported
in case of rapalogs (analogs of Rapamycin) elsewhere
[39, 40]. Beside this, 30 min after IR we observed the
up-regulation of p-ERK1/2 and p-MEK in 3 out of 4 cell
lines in the presence of PI-103 used under Schedule I,
especially after IR. The activation of ERK-pathway can
promote the survival of tumor cells [21, 41], in similar
with the activation of PI3K-pathway. The upregulation of
both PI3K- and ERK-pathways at the time of IR would
explain the lack of radiosensitization by PI-103 used under
Schedule I (i.e. long-term pretreatment) and the absence
of increased tumor cell killing after IR in the presence of
both substances (Figure 1B) compared with the action of
NVP-AUY922 alone.
A further critical step in the radiation response of
cells is apoptosis, which can be regulated by p-AKT, BclxL and other proteins. Our Western blot analysis of the
anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-xL revealed that at the time of
IR under Schedule I the expression of this protein was

The present study aimed to test (i) whether preventing
the up-regulation of Hsp90 and Hsp70 by PI-103,
an inhibitor of PI3K and mTOR, can enhance the
radiosensitizing effect of NVP-AUY922 in cancer cell
lines, and (ii) what is the optimum drug-IR treatment
schedule for radiosensitization of tumor cells.
The small synthetic inhibitor of Hsp90,
(the isoxazole resorcinol NVP-AUY922), studied here
has an improved bioavailability and lower toxicity, the
highest affinity for the NH2-terminal nucleotide-binding
site of Hsp90 [30] as well as beneficial pharmacological
properties. It also exhibits strong antiproliferative activity
against various tumor cell lines and primary tumors
in vitro and in vivo at well-tolerated doses [31]. We have
shown previously that NVP-AUY922 can radiosensitize
diverse tumor cell lines [10, 11].
A further substance used in the present study
is PI-103, a novel synthetic small molecule of the
pyridofuropyrimidine class, which is a potent and selective
inhibitor of class I PI3K [32], mTOR and DNA-PK with
therapeutic activity against a range of human tumor
xenografts [33]. In addition, PI-103 can radiosensitize
prostate [34], colorectal [35] and breast [36, 37] cancer
cells alone or in a combination with a PARP inhibitor
olaparib [37].
In the present study, the two inhibitors were added
(alone or in combination) to cells either 24 h before
IR. The cells were replated for the colony-forming test
immediately after IR (Schedule I), or, alternately, the
drugs were added 3 h before IR and the cells were replated
24 h post-IR (Schedule II). Under Schedule I, drug-treated
cells were already perturbed before IR with regard to the
cell cycle (either G1 or G2/M arrest) and the activity of the
PI3K- and MAPK-pathways, which were undesirably upregulated in case of PI-103 added alone. In contrast cells
treated with PI-103 under Schedule II were not arrested in
G1 phase during IR exposure. Moreover under Schedule II,
the MAPK pathway was not up-regulated yet and, most
notably, the PI3K pathway was even strongly repressed.
Cells irradiated under Schedule IIs were subjected to
further 24 h incubation with the inhibitors before replating
for the colony-forming test.
We found that upon long-term (24-h) drug pretreatment (Schedule I), concomitant PI3K/mTOR
inhibition slightly reduced the radiosensitizing activity
of the Hsp90 inhibitor in the majority of tested cell lines
(Figure 1B). In sharp contrast to the above finding(s),
the modified drug-IR treatment schedule, i.e. a shorter
pretreatment interval of 3 h along with an extended (24 h)
post-IR drug exposure (Schedule II), caused a much
stronger radiosensitizing effect in 4 tested cell lines than did
the Hsp90 inhibitor alone (Figure 2B). Moreover, PI-103
alone acted now as a moderate radiosensitizer in all
tested cell lines (Figure 2B). Taken together, the findings
presented in Figures 1 and 2 reveal the importance of the
treatment schedule for the radiosensitizing activity of
PI-103 alone and in combination with NVP-AUY922.

Figure 9: A simplified diagram of putative signaling pathways accountable for the differential responses of tumor cells
to PI3K/mTOR- (A-D) and Hsp90- (C, D) inhibition and IR used in two different drug-IR schedules. Incubation of tumor
cells with PI-103 for 24 h prior to IR (A, C) leads to a reactivation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway at the time of IR, most likely due to the
inhibition of the negative feedback loop mediated by ribosomal protein S6. Subsequently, the activated pro-survival kinase AKT prevents
radiation induced apoptosis. Beside this, 30 min after IR we observed the up-regulation of p-ERK1/2 and p-MEK in 3 out of 4 cell lines in
the presence of PI-103 used under Schedule I, especially after IR. Raf-1 and p-MEK can be also inhibited through the negative feedback
loop mediated by p-ERK [20]. Besides this, the expression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-xL was moderately increased. In contrast, after a short, 3-h
incubation with the PI-103, p-AKT is strongly suppressed at the time of IR (B, D), which can affect subsequent cell survival. Furthermore,
incubation with PI-103 for 24 h (A, C) causes a remarkable arrest in the G1-phase. In contrast, cells treated with PI-103 according Schedule II
(B, D) showed a strong G2/M arrest 24 h after IR. Under Schedule II, drug-treated and irradiated cells showed a delayed DNA damage
repair response (Figure 6 and Supplementary Figures S17–S19). To summarize, long-term pre-incubation with PI-103 (A, C) causes no
radiosensitization by the substance itself and no enhancement of the radiosensitizing effect of NVP-AUY922 (C). In contrast, a short-term
pretreatment with PI-103 (B, D) gives rise to a radiosensitization effect by PI-103 alone and in combination with NVP-AUY922 (D).

moderately increased in most tested cell lines (except
SW48) treated with PI-103 or NVP-AUY922, or both
(Figure 3 and Supplementary Figures S3–S5).
As mentioned above, the anti-apoptotic protein
p-AKT was reactivated (Figure 3 LHS) in PI-103-treated
samples after a temporary depletion induced by the short
drug application (Figure 3 RHS). Activated AKT is widely
recognized as the major mediator of cell survival, which
inhibits apoptosis through several mechanisms [42], e.g.
keeping mitochondrial integrity, phosphorylation and
inactivation of the proapoptotic BAD and caspase 9 etc.
[43]. BAD maintains Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL function, which
inhibit apoptosis mainly at the mitochondrial level by
suppressing cytochrome c release [44]. The activation
of Bcl-xL and p-AKT observed here can therefore be
responsible, among other factors, for the absence of the
increased radiation sensitivity of tumor cells treated with
PI-103 alone or in combination with the NVP-AUY922
after long (24 h) preincubation before IR. In contrast, under
Schedule II the p-AKT was down-regulated and Bcl-xL
was not increased in the samples treated with PI-103
alone or in combination with NVP-AUY922.
Cleaved PARP (Figure 5), an indicator of apoptosis,
was observed in the present study only after a 24-h
incubation with NVP-AUY922 alone or in combination
with PI-103. The lack of apoptosis in cells treated with
PI-103 alone is in agreement with the published data [33, 45].
On the other hand, several studies found PI-103-induced
apoptosis in radioresistant prostate [34], lung carcinoma
[46] and breast [36] cancer cells. Most likely, the induction
of apoptosis by PI-103 is cell type-specific [33, 45].
A further critical determinant of radiation-induced
cell death is the induction and repair of DNA DSBs,
probed in this study by the expression of histone γH2AX
(Figure 6 and Supplementary Figures S17–S19). We found
that the kinetics of DNA damage repair differed markedly
between two treatments protocols. In cells pretreated with
NVP-AUY922 alone or in a combination with PI-103
under Schedule I, the DNA damage recovered much faster
than in respective samples treated according Schedule II,
which showed an elevated residual DNA damage levels
24 h after IR. This finding corroborates the results of Kao
and co-workers [47] who showed that inhibition of PI3K
activity probably does not abolish the sensing of DNA
damage but rather leads to a reduced repair of this damage.
Next we found a cell type-specific reduction of
DNA repair protein Rad51 after PI-103 treatment and an
almost complete disappearance of Rad51 after prolonged
Hsp90 inhibition (Figure 7). The reason for the inhibition
of Rad51 by PI-103 can be the drug-mediated G1 arrest,
similar to that reported for a different PI3K and mTOR
inhibitor NVP-BEZ35 [27, 48]. It is known that Rad51
operates mostly during Homologous Recombination
(HR) of DNA, which appears to be active only from the
mid-S to G2 phases of the cell cycle [49]. Accordingly, a
reduced portion of cells in these cell cycle phases might
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

have led to a decline in Rad51 expression. This result
was also confirmed in our experiments. Another finding
is that prolonged treatment with the Hsp90 inhibitor lead
to a complete loss of Rad51, as seen in Figure 7, which
is in accordance with the published literature [50–52]
showing that Hsp90 inhibition by 17-AAG down-regulates
Rad51 in NSCLC [52] and prostate [50] carcinoma cells.
Similarly, NVP-AUY922 abrogates HR in head and neck
squamous carcinoma cells [51]. At the same time, the
expression patterns of Rad51 were similar under both
treatment schedules (Figure 7). Accordingly, Rad51 cannot
be responsible for the impaired DNA repair observed
under Schedule II.
In addition to the above considerations, the
differences in cells’ radiosensitivity treated with PI-103
alone or in a combination with NVP-AUY922 between
both schedules (Figures 1B, 2B) can be partly explained
by the peculiarities of cell cycle distribution. Thus, longterm treatment with PI-103 (Schedule I) prior to IR caused
the cells to reside predominantly in G1 phase (Figure 8
and Supplementary Figure S20), which is the most
radioresistant cell cycle phase. Interestingly, combined
PI-103-IR treatment under Schedule II caused a strong
G2/M block 24 h after IR (Figure 8 and Supplementary
Figure S20). As a result, cells in the G2/M phase may be
more radiosensitive than those treated with PI-103 alone
and irradiated under Schedule I.
Taken together, the results presented here provide
clear evidence for the importance of drug-IR schedule.
Our results are in line with findings that the efficacy of
the combined radiochemotherapy relies, among others
factors, on the schedule of drug administration [28, 29].
Particularly, the combination of gemcitabine followed
by gefitinib (an inhibitor of the epidermal growth factor
receptor) has been found be more effective in controlling
tumor growth than the reverse drug schedule [29].
To sum up, our data demonstrate an enhanced
radiosensitivity in tumor cells pretreated simultaneously
with PI3K/mTOR and Hsp90 inhibitors shortly before
IR compared with the cells treated with Hsp90 inhibitor
alone. The complex mechanisms underlying the increased
radiosensitization by PI-103 and NVP-AUY922 inhibitors
involve apparently several, cell line-specific pathways that
lead to the down-regulation of PI3K- and ERK-pathways at
the moment of IR, strong G2/M arrest and protracted DNA
damage repair 24 h thereafter, and to a lesser extent, to
apoptosis. In contrast, the long-term treatment with PI-103
before IR caused a reactivation of PI3K and MAPK
prosurvival pathways, G1 arrest at the moment of IR,
and a proficient DNA damage repair. Yet the observed
strong arrest of tumor cells in G1 phase justified the use
of the PI-103 as a potential cytostatic drug. Finally, our
in vitro data reveal the importance of the duration of PI3K/
mTOR inhibition before IR for the radiosensitization of
tumor cells by Hsp90 inhibitors and pave the way for future
exploration of combination of molecularly targeted therapy

X-ray irradiation

and radiation on in vivo mouse tumor model. The data
are of particular interest for the cancer therapy, because
NVP-AUY922 is currently in clinical trials Phase I-II
(www.clinicaltrials.gov), but without IR yet. Besides
raising important questions concerning the mechanisms
of radiosensitization, the in vitro data presented here will
surely prompt further clinical studies on the possibility
of combining NVP-AUY922 and PI-103 with radiation,
which may open up a promising approach for improved
local control of cancer.

Irradiation was performed at room temperature using
a 6 MV Siemens linear accelerator (Siemens, Concord,
CA) at a dose rate of 2 Gy/min. After irradiation, cells
were kept in CGM for the indicated time until harvest.

Colony survival assay
Cell survival curves were generated by a standard
colony formation assay as previously described. [53]
Subconfluent monolayers of drug-treated and non-treated
cells were irradiated in culture flasks filled with CGM at
room temperature by graded single doses (0 8 Gy), seeded
either 30 min (Schedule I) or 24 h (Schedule II) post-IR
in Petri dishes and then cultivated in CGM for the next
2 weeks. After 2 weeks, the cells were fixed and stained
with crystal violet (0.6%). The mean survival data for
each individual cell line were fitted to the linear quadratic
model (LQ, Equation 1):
SF = exp (−αX − βX2) (Equation 1),
where, SF is the survival fraction, X is the irradiation
dose, α and β are the fitted parameters.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cells
The set of human tumor cell lines studied here
includes 2 glioblastoma, GaMG (PTEN wt, p53 mut), and
SNB19 (PTEN mut, p53 mut), and 2 colon carcinoma,
SW480 (PTEN wt, p53 mut, kRas mut), and SW48 (PTEN
wt, p53 wt) cell lines. All cell lines were obtained from
the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA)
and routinely cultured under standard conditions (5% CO2,
37°C) in complete growth medium (CGM), which was
either DMEM (GaMG, SNB19) or RPMI-1640 (SW480,
SW48), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum.

Western blot
For immunoblot analysis, whole-cell lysates were
prepared according to standard procedures. Samples
equivalent to 20 40 µg of protein were separated using
4–12% SDS-polyacrylamide pre-cast gels (Invitrogen,
Karlsruhe, Germany) and transferred to nitrocellulose
membranes. For protein detection, membranes were
incubated with respective primary and species-specific
peroxidase-labeled secondary antibodies according to
standard protocols. The levels of protein expression were
quantified using the ImageJ software (NIH, Bethesda, MD)
and normalized to the β-actin levels.

Cell ciability assay
The intracellular ATP level, as an indicator of cell
viability, was determined by means of the CellTiter-Glo
Luminiscent Cell Viability Assay (Promega, Madison, WI)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Serial
dilutions of PI-103 (0–20 µM) in CGM were added to cell
cultures in quadruplicates and the drug cytotoxicity was
determined 24 h later. The concentration of NVP-AUY922
was kept constant at 200 nM [10]. Control samples
contained the respective concentrations of DMSO.

Detection of histone γH2AX and cell-cycle
measurements by flow cytometry

Drug treatment
Both drugs were obtained from Selleckchem
(Absource Diagnostics GmbH, Munich, Germany). The
drugs were freshly diluted from frozen aliquots in DMSO
stored at 20°C. PI-103 (2 µM, [15]) and NVP-AUY922
(200 nM, [10]) were applied in two different schedules
(Supplementary Figure S2). In Schedule I the substances
were added 24 h before IR and kept during and after IR.
Under Schedule II the drugs were added 3 h prior to IR
and remained in CGM up to 24 h post-IR. Cells treated
in parallel with respective amounts of DMSO served as
controls.

Nontreated and drugtreated cell cultures were
irradiated as subconfluent monolayers in CGM at room
temperature. The cells were then incubated under standard
conditions and analyzed by flow cytometry 30 min and
24 h after IR exposure. For analysis, cells were trypsinized,
washed twice in PBS, fixed and stained for γH2AX
according to a protocol described elsewhere [54]. The cells
were then counterstained with propidium iodide (Sigma
P-4170, 10 µg/ml) in the presence of ribonuclease A
(Sigma R-5250, 25 µg/ml) as described elsewhere [55].
At least 20,000 cells were assayed for histone γH2AX and
DNA distribution using a flow cytometer FACSCantoII
(Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA). Cellular green (histone
γH2AX) or red fluorescence (Propidium iodide-DNA) was
acquired in logarithmic or linear mode, respectively. The
