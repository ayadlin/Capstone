BACKGROUND: Among the treatment options that have been developed for cancer, chemotherapy remains 1 of the
leading clinical approaches. Chemotherapy can usually control tumor growth at the onset of disease, but its effectiveness
becomes limited by the overexpression of transporter proteins responsible for drug efflux, leading to multidrug resistance
(MDR). To overcome this obstacle, the authors explored the feasibility of down-regulating the main drug transporter, Pglycoprotein (P-gp), by using nonviral small interfering RNA (siRNA) delivery as means to enhance the accumulation of
chemotherapeutic agents in drug-resistant cancer cells. METHODS: Several cationic carriers capable of siRNA complexation were investigated for P-gp down-regulation in the MDA435/LCC6 cell line and, consequently, increased cellular
uptake of the chemotherapeutic agents doxorubicin and paclitaxel. RESULTS: Efficient siRNA delivery into tumor cells
was demonstrated particularly using a palmitic-acid substituted poly(L-lysine), with no apparent differences in siRNA
delivery between the wild type (WT)-expressing and P-gp-expressing phenotype (MDR1) of the cells. Efficient siRNA
delivery led to approximately 40% to 50% P-gp suppression (based on the average expression level of the protein), an
approximately 3-fold increased DOX uptake, and increased cytotoxicity in MDR1 cells. CONCLUSIONS: The authors concluded that effective siRNA delivery with nonviral carriers can reduce the level of P-gp on cell surfaces and enhance the

Cancer is among the leading causes of mortality worldwide. An estimated 1.7 million individuals will be diagnosed
with cancer in 2009 in North America, and approximately 640,000 individuals will die of the disease.1,2 Chemotherapy
remains 1 of the main treatment options for patients with cancer, although its effectiveness can be limited by multidrug resistance (MDR).3,4 MDR is caused by overexpression of cell membrane transporters, among which the P-glycoprotein (Pgp) has been identified as the most common form.5 P-gp is a member of the ABC-transporter family that reportedly is responsible for MDR in breast6,7 and ovarian cancer cells.8 P-gp acts as an adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-dependant efflux
pump that exports cytotoxic substrates of the cells. To increase drug uptake in tumor cells with high P-gp content, this
transporter protein can be suppressed to increase the efficiency of chemotherapy. Several types of chemical inhibitors and
modulators of P-gp activity have been explored9; however, to date, the clinical use of such chemical inhibitors has not led
to clear success in reversing MDR.10
Unlike chemical regulators, RNA interference (RNAi) technology, in particular, small interfering RNAs (siRNAs),11
may provide a more effective approach for the down-regulation of protein targets like P-gp. The siRNAs usually are short
molecules (21-25 nucleotides long) that are generated endogenously through the breakdown of long, double-stranded
RNAs by dicers. Then, the siRNA is activated through binding to an RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC),12 which
unwinds the siRNA duplex and produces an oligonucleotide specific for a target messenger RNA (mRNA), leading to

cleavage and disposal of the resulting double-stranded
RNA.13,14 Among the advantages of using siRNA are its
reduced toxicity on nonspecific tissues compared with
conventional P-gp inhibitors and its high degree of specificity on a desired molecular target.15 The main obstacles
for therapeutic use of siRNA are difficulty in transport
through the cellular plasma membrane and the presence
of nucleases in the physiologic milieu. siRNA cannot cross
the lipid-bilayer plasma membrane on its own because of
its anionic nature and requires a carrier for transport
across the plasma membrane. Several groups have
explored the feasibility of siRNA to suppress the MDR1
gene. Strong down-regulation of P-gp was obtained previously using a self-complementary recombinant adenoassociated virus (scAAV)16 in which approximately 80%
P-gp protein suppression was achieved. However, significant concerns associated with viral carriers, such as the
possibility of oncogenicity,17 inflammation of the target
tissues,18 and cellular immune responses against viruses,19
will impede the translation of this approach into clinical
practice. Nonviral delivery approaches could be more feasible in a clinical setting given their suitability for scale-up
and their minimal, if any, immunogenicity. Nonviral
siRNA delivery using lipid-based carriers has resulted in
significant P-gp suppression in some reports6,7,20; however, a clear functional outcome, namely, increased intracellular accumulation and cytotoxic effect of drugs, has
not been clearly demonstrated. Moreover, these carriers
are intended for siRNA delivery in culture and display relatively weak protection of siRNA against serum21; thus,
they are not suitable for systemic administration.
In a previous study, we demonstrated that lipidmodified polymers are efficient gene carriers that are able
to condense relatively large plasmid DNAs (>1000 base
pairs) and protect them against nuclease degradation.22,23
Lipid substitution on cationic polymers enhanced the
transport of plasmid DNA across cellular membranes.23
In the current study, we explored the feasibility of this
type of carriers for siRNA delivery with the purpose of Pgp down-regulation in a tumor cell model. The ultimate
objectives were to suppress the transporter activity responsible for chemoresistance and to increase drug concentrations in tumor cells, leading to increased cytotoxicity by
the chemotherapeutic agents.8 The drugs that we included
in this study are in current clinical use: doxorubicin
(DOX) and paclitaxel (PTX).24 The uptake of these drugs
into P-gp–expressing MDA435/LCC6 (MDR1) cells was
assessed and compared with the drug uptake by the wild
type (WT) cells. Drug uptake was assessed with or with-

drug toxicity were evaluated.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Materials
Poly(L-lysine) (PLL) (25,500 daltons [Da]), polyethylenimine (PEI) (branched; 25,000 Da), and anhydrous dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) were purchased from Aldrich
(Milwaukee, Wis). Hanks Balanced Salt Solution
(HBSS), trypsin/ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid
(EDTA), 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2Htetrazolium bromide (MTT), cyclosporine A (CyA), and
protease inhibitor cocktail were obtained from Sigma
Chemical Company (St. Louis, Mo). Clear HBSS (phenol
red free) was prepared in house. RPMI 1640 medium,
penicillin (10,000 U/mL), and streptomycin (10 mg/mL)
were obtained from Gibco (Grand Island, NY). Fetal bovine serum (FBS) was obtained from PAA Laboratories
Inc. (Etobicoke, Ontario). Fluorescence (FAM)-labeled
siRNA was purchased from Ambion (Austin, Tex). Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled mouse antihuman
P-gp antibody was purchased from BD Biosciences Pharmingen (San Diego, Calif). The ABCB1 siRNA against
P-gp (catalog no. SI00018732) and a control siRNA were
purchased from QIAGEN (Mississauga, Ontario). DOX
HCl was obtained from Fluka Analytical (Mumbai,
India), and PTX was obtained from LC Laboratories
(Woburn, Mass). Lipofectamine 2000 was purchased
from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, Calif). WT MDA-435/LCC6
cells (referred to as WT cells) and their MDR1-transfected
phenotype (referred as MDR1 cells) kindly were provided
by Dr. R. Clarke (Georgetown University Medical
School, Washington, DC). A lysis buffer was prepared by
mixing 0.1% Tween in 50 mM Tris-Cl and 150 mM
NaCl.
Carriers Used for siRNA Delivery
The carriers used for siRNA delivery were PLL, stearic
acid-substituted PLL (PLL-StA), PEI, oleic acid-substituted PEI (PEI-OA), and Lipofectamine 2000. The synthesis and characterization of the PLL-StA (degree of
substitution, 10 stearic acids per PLL) were described previously by Abbasi et al.22 The synthesis and characterization of PEI-OA (degree of substitution, 4.6 oleic acids per
PEI) were described previously by Alshamsan et al.21
MTT Assay for Cytotoxicity
MDR1 cells and WT cells were seeded in 24-well plates in
0.5 mL RPMI medium and allowed to attach overnight.

The medium was then aspirated, and 0.25 mL of fresh
medium was added to the cells. Multiple concentrations
of DOX and PTX ranging from 0.003 lg/mL to 19 lg/
mL were incubated with the cells (in triplicate) for 24
hours. At the end of the incubation period, 20 lL of
MTT stock solution in phosphate-buffered saline (5 mg/
mL) were added to each well. After 3 hours, the medium
was aspirated, and the precipitated formazan was dissolved in 200 lL DMSO. Cell viability was determined
by measuring the absorbance (A) at 570 nm (with reference value at 650 nm). Cell viability was calculated as a
percentage of control (untreated) cells as follows: ([A]test/
[A]control)  100%.
The MTT assay also was used to detect carrier and
siRNA complex toxicities on the cells. To assess complex
toxicities, the siRNA/carrier complexes were prepared at
1:10 siRNA:carrier ratios and were added to the cells for
24 hours at carrier concentrations of 0.425 lg/mL, 0.85
lg/mL, 1.75 lg/mL, and 3.5 lg/mL. The negative control siRNA was used to assess general toxicities of the
siRNA complexes. The ABCB1 siRNA against P-gp was
also used to investigate the effect of P-gp down-regulation
on drug toxicities. For the latter investigations, the cells
were treated with siRNA/carrier complexes for 48 hours
(fresh complexes were added after 24 hours); then, DOX
or PTX was added to the cells at a dose of 0.2 lg/mL, 0.6
lg/mL, and 2 lg/mL for 24 hours; and the MTT assay
was performed as described above.
DOX Uptake by Flow Cytometry
The MDR1 and WT cells were incubated with multiple
concentrations of DOX ranging from 0.003 lg/mL to 19
lg/mL for 24 hours in 24-well plates with 0.25 mL of
fresh medium per well. After removing the DOX-containing media, the cells were washed with clear HBSS, trypsinized, and suspended in HBSS plus 3.7% formalin. DOX
uptake was quantified with a Beckman Coulter flow cytometer (Cell Lab Quanta; Beckman Coulter, Inc., Brea,
Calif) using the FL-2 detection channel to assess DOXpositive cells (3000 events per sample). The instrument
was calibrated so that the negative control sample (ie, nontreated cells) yielded 1% to 2% cells that were positive for
DOX.
CyA Inhibition of P-gp
The MDR1 cells in 24-well plates (with 0.25 mL medium
per well) were exposed to 5 lg/mL CyA and DOX concentrations of 0.2 lg/mL, 0.6 lg/mL, and 2 lg/mL to
detect DOX accumulation with chemical inhibition of

5546

P-gp. The cells were prepared for flow cytometry, and
DOX assessment was performed using the FL-2 channel
as described above.
Cellular Uptake of siRNA by Flow Cytometry
and Agarose Gel Electrophoresis
The MDR1 and WT cells in 24-well plates (0.25 mL fresh
medium per well) were incubated with FAM-labeled,
scrambled siRNA to assess siRNA uptake by flow cytometry. A final concentration of 0.35 lg/mL of siRNA was
incubated with 3.5 lg/mL of carrier in 150 mM NaCl to
form complexes for 30 minutes. Then, the complexes
were added to the cells in triplicate. After 24 hours, the
media containing the complexes were removed, and the
cells were washed with clear HBSS, trypsinized, and suspended in HBSS with 3.7% formalin. The siRNA uptake
was quantified by flow cytometry using the FL-1 detection channel as described above to assess the FAMpositive cells.
In parallel studies, siRNA uptake was assessed by
extracting the siRNA from MDR1 and WT cells and
determining the amount of intact siRNA by gel electrophoresis. For this assessment, the cells were treated with
the FAM-labeled siRNA complexes for 24 hours as
described above, then washed with HBSS, and recovered
by trypsinization at the indicated time points. The cell
pellets were lyzed with 40 lL lysis buffer with the addition
of 10 lL protease inhibitor. Cells were then placed on a
shaker for 30 minutes and the solutions obtained after cell
lysis were treated with heparin (0.625%) for 20 minutes
and with EDTA (0.06 mM) for 5 minutes. Four microliters of 6  diluted loading buffer were added to the samples, and the samples were run on a 1.5% agarose gel (at
120 V for 35 minutes). For a reference standard, an equivalent amount of the FAM-labeled siRNA (ie, an amount
equal to the total amount exposed to the cells) was run on
the gel. FAM-labeled siRNA was detected with a Fuji
FLA-5000 flatbed scanner (Fujifilm, Tokyo, Japan) using
a blue laser diode (485 nm), and the percentage recovery
was calculated based on the spot densitometry as follows:
100%  (free siRNA/control siRNA).
P-gp Down-Regulation With siRNA
The MDR1 and WT cells in 24-well plates (with 0.25 mL
of medium) were incubated with an ABCB1 siRNA specific for P-gp down-regulation. First, 3.5 lg/mL PLLStA, PEI, PEI-OA, or Lipofectamine 2000 were incubated with 0.35 lg/mL ABCB1 siRNA for 30 minutes to
form complexes. Then, the complexes were added to the

cells either once (after 24 hours), twice (after 24 hours and
48 hours), or 3 times (after 24 hours, 48 hours, and 72
hours) at a concentration of 20 nM. At indicated time
points, 10 lL of FITC-labeled antihuman P-gp antibody
were added to the cells. The cells were then washed with
clear HBSS, trypsinized, and suspended in HBSS with
3.7% formalin. The amount of P-gp in cells was quantified with the Beckman Coulter flow cytometer (Cell Lab
Quanta) using the FL-1 detection channel as described
above.
DOX Uptake After siRNA Treatment
The complexes were prepared with 0.35 lg/mL siRNA
and 3.5 lg/mL PLL-StA, PEI, PEI-OA, and Lipofectamine 2000 and added to the MDR1 cells in 24-well
plates (with 0.25 mL medium) for 24 hours or 48 hours.
In the 48-hour experiment, fresh complexes were prepared and added to the cells after 24 hours. Cells were
incubated with 0.2 lg/mL, 0.6 lg/mL, and 2 lg/mL
DOX on Day 2 to detect DOX uptake after P-gp suppression. After an additional 24 hours of incubation, the flow
cytometry analysis was performed using the FL-2 channel
as described above to detect DOX uptake.
Statistical Analysis
Where indicated, the current results are summarized as
the mean  standard deviation (SD) of the indicated
number of replicates. Variations between the group means
were analyzed with Student t tests. The level of significance was set at a ¼ .05.

RESULTS
Characterization of MDA435/LCC6
MDR1 and WT Cells
The sensitivity of the cells to DOX and PTX is illustrated
in Figure 1. After 24 hours of DOX treatment, the
MDR1 cells had greater viability compared with the WT
cells. A precipitous drop in cell viability was observed at
0.3 lg/mL DOX for WT cells, unlike the MDR1 phenotype (Fig. 1A). Similar results were obtained after 72 hours
of DOX treatment (Fig. 1B). With PTX treatment, the
MDR1 cells again had greater viability compared with the
WT cells after 24 hours of treatment, and a precipitous
drop in viability was observed at 3 lg/mL (Fig. 1C). After 72 hours of PTX treatment, WT cells displayed more
cytotoxicity compared with MDR1 cells, and a precipitous
drop in viability was observed at 3 lg/mL (Fig. 1D).
DOX uptake by the cells was assessed as a function
of DOX concentration (Fig. 2). No uptake was detected

Cancer

December 1, 2010

at a DOX concentration <0.03 lg/mL; at greater concentrations, a DOX concentration-dependent uptake was
observed in both cell types. At 0.3 lg/mL, 20% of
MDR1 cells displayed uptake, whereas 80% of WT cells
displayed DOX uptake. Almost all cells of both types displayed uptake at >0.6 lg/mL DOX (Fig. 2A). The mean
fluorescence of the cell population (which is representative
of the amount of DOX in cells) clearly differed between
MDR1 cells and WT cells, with the latter cells producing
greater DOX uptake at all concentrations tested (Fig. 2B).
The chemical P-gp inhibitor CyA was effective in increasing DOX uptake by MDR1 cells; between DOX concentrations of 0.2 mM and 2 mM, a drastic increase in DOX
uptake was evident in the presence of CyA based on both
the percentage of DOX-positive cells (Fig. 2C) and the
mean DOX levels in the cell population (Fig. 2D). CyA
yielded almost 100% DOX-positive cells and increased
DOX uptake by 20-fold at the highest DOX concentration tested (2 lg/mL). PTX uptake was not assessed in
this study, because the drug displays no fluorescence.
siRNA uptake with PLL-StA, PEI, PEI-OA, and Lipofectamine 2000 was investigated by flow cytometry and
was evident with all carriers with no differences between
WT cells and MDR1 cells. In both cell types, siRNA
uptake reached a maximal value of 80% to 100% of cells
in 8 hours and remained high after 24 hours. After 48
hours, PEI and PEI-OA displayed maximal values, whereas
PLL-StA and Lipofectamine 2000 produced a significant
decrease (45%). The uptake after 72 hours displayed a
similar pattern with a slight decrease in values (Fig. 3A).
The accumulation of siRNA in MDR1 and WT
cells was investigated by recovering the internalized
siRNA at different time points and assessing it quantitatively by gel electrophoresis. There was significant difference in siRNA recovery between WT cells and MDR1
cells, and the maximum amount of siRNA was recovered
at 8 to 24 hours. At these time points, PEI and PEI-OA
had the greatest siRNA recovery (40%-45%), PLL-StA
had 30% to 35% siRNA recovery, and Lipofectamine
2000 had 15% to 20% siRNA recovery. The amount of
siRNA was reduced significantly at 48 hours and 72
hours, although PEI and PEI-OA had 20% siRNA recovery at these time points (Fig. 3B).
P-gp Suppression by siRNA
ABCB1 siRNA was delivered to MDR1 cells by PLL-StA,
PEI, PEI-OA, and Lipofectamine 2000; and P-gp levels
were assessed by flow cytometry. To investigate the kinetics
of P-gp suppression, the cells were treated with siRNA for 3

hours of DOX exposure, the viability of multidrug resistance 1 (MDR1) cells gradually decreased as the DOX concentration was
increased, producing approximately 60% cell viability with 30 lg/mL DOX, whereas the wild type (WT) cells produced only
approximately 10% viability at DOX concentrations >0.3 lg/mL. (B) After 72 hours of DOX exposure, the sensitivity of MDR1 cells
to DOX was increased. Only 40% viability was detected at 30 lg/mL DOX, whereas the WT cells displayed the same trend that
was observed with the 24-hour DOX treatment. (C) Twenty-four hours of PTX exposure did not affect the viability of MDR1 cells,
unlike the WT cells, which displayed 10% to 20% viability at >3.0 lg/mL PTX. (D) Seventy-two hours of PTX exposure produced a
gradual decrease in the viability of MDR1 cells, which reached approximately 60% viability after treatment with 30 lg/mL PTX.
The WT cells displayed the same trend that was observed with 24 hours of PTX exposure.

days with a daily repeated dose of complexes. The siRNA
delivered by PLL-StA produced 40% P-gp suppression at
all times (P < .05 vs no carrier). The siRNA delivered by
PEI and PEI-OA produced no P-gp suppression on Day 1,
produced 35% suppression on Day 2 (P < .03 vs no carrier), and produced 20% suppression on Day 3 (P < .05 vs
no carrier). With Lipofectamine 2000, 40% P-gp suppression was detected on Days 2 and 3 (P < .04), but no
suppression was detected on Day 1 (Fig. 4).
DOX Uptake and Cytotoxicity After
siRNA Delivery to Cells
DOX uptake after P-gp suppression was assessed by flow
cytometry. There was an increase in DOX uptake of the

5548

ABCB1 siRNA-treated cells compared with the scrambled
siRNA-treated cells (Fig. 5). When ABCB1 siRNA was
delivered by PLL-StA, 1.3-fold to 2.5-fold increased
DOX levels were obtained when MDR1 cells were incubated with 0.2 to 2.0 lg/mL DOX (P < .02). No significant increase in DOX uptake was detected when the
ABCB1 siRNA was delivered with PEI or PEI-OA. Lipofectamine 2000-delivered siRNA also effectively increased
DOX uptake by 2-fold at 0.6 lg/mL and 2.0 lg/mL
DOX (Fig. 5).
The cytotoxicity of DOX and PTX subsequently
was assessed upon P-gp suppression. After siRNA delivery
by PLL-StA, a 30% differential decrease in cell viability
was detected between ABCB1 siRNA and scrambled

not effective in enhancing DOX cytotoxicity. There was

in cell viability (P < .05), and exposure to 2 lg/mL

effective in increasing the cytotoxicity of PTX, and 3)

DISCUSSION
We demonstrated previously that palmitic, myristic, and
stearic acid-substituted PLLs are efficient carriers of plasmid DNA delivery to mammalian cells.22,23 The finding
that an efficient siRNA delivery also has been obtained
with these polymers opens a new possibility for the use of
the lipid-substituted polymers in down-regulating aberrant genes. The limitations of chemotherapy because of
MDR are well recognized,8 and siRNA knockdown of
P-gp is a promising option for overcoming this problem.
In addition to P-gp, other proteins are involved in MDR,
such as MDR-associated proteins 1 and 2 (MRP1 and
MRP2),25 lung resistance-related protein (LRP),26 and
breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP).25 However, P-gp
is the most consistent link to MDR in cancer cells,27,28
making it the natural focus for silencing. To validate the
cell model that was chosen for the current study,

cells. Polyethylenimine (PEI) and PEI-oleic acid-substituted (PEI-OA) were the most effective with 80% to 100% uptake, whereas
poly(L-lysine) (PLL)-stearic acid-substituted (PLL-StA) and Lipofectamine 2000 (Lipo) had maximum efficiency at 8 to 24 hours,
and the uptake was reduced to 40% and 50% at 48 hours and 72 hours, respectively. NT indicates nontreated cells. (B) siRNA recovery from WT and MDR1 cells is illustrated after extracting siRNA from the cells. Some siRNA could be recovered from the cells
after 4 hours, and maximal uptake typically was observed between 8 hours and 24 hours. Like in the flow cytometry analysis, PEI
and PEI-OA produced the greatest siRNA internalization (range, 40%-45% at 24 hours). Cells that were treated with PLL-StgA
and Lipo complexes had 30% to 35% and approximately 15% siRNA recovery, respectively, at 24 hours. At 48 hours and 72 hours,
approximately 20% of siRNA could be recovered from cells that were treated with PEI and PEI-OA complexes.

overexpression of the MDR1 gene product P-gp was demonstrated in MDA435/LCC6 cells; >90% of MDR1 cells
were positive for P-gp (not shown), and the cells experienced lower drug cytotoxicities, as indicated by the lower
DOX and PTX uptake in these cells and demonstrated
directly in the case of DOX. Combined with the CyAbased enhancement of DOX uptake, all of these analyses
provide comprehensive validation of the chosen cell
model for the purpose of the current study.
All carriers were able to protect siRNA against serum
degradation at 1:10 siRNA:carrier ratios, but only polymeric carriers protected the siRNA against degradation at

5550

reduced siRNA:carrier ratios (1:3 and 1:1; results not
shown). The weak protection afforded by Lipofectamine
2000 was consistent with other reports that indicated the
superior ability of polymers to protect siRNA against serum nucleases.21,29 The lipid modification of PLL led to
greater delivery of siRNA into the cells. PLL-StA enabled
siRNA delivery to almost all cells (90% by flow cytometry) but produced a significant drop in siRNA levels after
48 hours. This delivery pattern was similar to the delivery
pattern observed with Lipofectamine 2000. The gradual
decrease in siRNA levels may reflect the release of siRNA
in the cytosol, leading to a gradual degradation of the

were detected by flow cytometry after 24 hours, 28 hours,
and 72 hours of treatment with siRNA and were normalized
with respect to untreated cells. The poly(L-lysine) (PLL)-stearic acid-substituted (PLL-StA)/siRNA-treated cells produced
40% to 50% P-gp down-regulation during the 72-hour study
period. The polyethylenimine (PEI)/siRNA-treated cells and
the PEI-oleic acid-substituted (PEI-OA)/siRNA-treated cells
produced almost no P-gp down-regulation after 24 hours but
produced approximately 40% down-regulation after 48 hours
and approximately 20% down-regulation after 72 hours. The
siRNA that was delivered with Lipofectamine 2000 (Lipo)
produced no P-gp down-regulation at 24 hours but produced
approximately 50% and approximately 40% P-gp down-regulation at 48 hours and 72 hours, respectively.

molecule with intracellular nucleases. Whereas up to 30%
of the siRNA incubated with the cells was recovered after
8 to 24 hours, almost no siRNA was recovered from the
cells after 48 hours, which provided an indication of the
time frame for complete siRNA degradation in the cytosol
with PLL-StA and Lipofectamine 2000 (Fig. 3). PEI and
PEI-OA had good ability to deliver siRNA into cells and
provided delivery to almost all cells (80%-95%) after 48
to 72 hours. The finding that siRNA uptake and intracellular kinetics were similar in WT and MDR1 cells indicated that P-gp overexpression did not affect siRNA
uptake and/or efflux.
Our initial P-gp down-regulation results indicated
that higher carrier:siRNA ratios were more effective in Pgp knockdown. This may be caused by the better encapsulation of siRNA and, thus, a longer half-life of siRNA
inside the cells. This finding was consistent with the data
in the literature indicating higher gene knockdown at
higher carrier:siRNA ratios.30,31 P-gp down-regulation
using 20 nM siRNA in the current study was a significant
achievement, because most studies have reported P-gp
down-regulation at siRNA concentrations >100 nM.6,29

tant for minimizing nonspecific (ie, off-target) siRNA
activity.32-34 With multiple siRNA treatments over 24hour intervals, 40% to 50% P-gp suppression was
gained after 72 hours using PLL-StA and Lipofectamine
2000. PEI and PEI-OA were not efficient at 24 hours
but had greater efficiency at 48 hours and 72 hours,
albeit at a lower levels than the other 2 carriers (Fig. 4).
Incomplete or slow dissociation of siRNA from these
polymers may have been the reason for this result,
because siRNA dissociation from its carriers is paramount for its binding to the RISC complex and manifests the subsequent silencing activity.
The ultimate goal of P-gp knockdown is to impede
drug efflux and increase intracellular levels of drugs that
are P-gp substrates. However, the treatment of cells with
siRNA complexes alone led to autofluorescence, complicating the assessment of DOX uptake. This phenomenon
depended on both the carrier and the carrier concentration and particularly manifested with the PEI complexes.
Cell treatment with complexes that were prepared with
nonspecific siRNA was necessary to account for this apparent artifact. It was evident that higher concentrations of
PEI (>1.75 lg/mL) lead to cytotoxicity and autofluorescence that gave false indications of DOX uptake in flow
cytometry. siRNA delivery by PLL-StA resulted in an up
to 2.5-fold increase in DOX-positive MDR1 cells,
whereas siRNA delivery by PEI did not result in a considerable increase in DOX-positive cells. siRNA delivery
with Lipofectamine 2000 yielded a desirable increase in
DOX uptake only at the highest concentration tested
(Fig. 5). Complementary cytotoxicity studies with the
MTT assay revealed increases of 35% and 25% in the
cytotoxicity of DOX-treated cells and PTX-treated cells,
respectively, after siRNA delivery by PLL-StA. There was
a good consistency between the carrier efficiency to suppress P-gp and the drug cytotoxicities obtained. To eliminate any complication from cytotoxic drugs (which
potentially could eliminate a subpopulation of cells that
display high uptake), cellular uptake of the P-gp substrate
rhodamine also was explored after P-gp down-regulation
and yielded results similar to those produced by the DOX
uptake studies (results not shown). The CyA-treated cells
had much higher elevations in DOX uptake (>10-fold)
in terms of both the percentage of cells that displayed
DOX uptake and the absolute DOX levels compared with
siRNA-treated cells, indicating that siRNA-meditated
silencing could be enhanced further. However, the nonspecific toxicity associated with CyA35 prevents its clinical
application as a P-gp suppressor.

Figure 5. These charts illustrate the flow-cytometric analysis of doxorubicin (DOX) uptake in multidrug resistance (MDR) cells
that were treated with ABCB1 and control small interfering RNA (siRNA) complexes. The results are summarized as (A) the percentage of DOX-positive cells or (B) the mean DOX fluorescence per cell. In the absence of any carrier, incubating siRNA with
the cells did not change the DOX uptake pattern. A clear difference between the control and ABCB1 siRNA-treated cells was evident in the case of poly(L-lysine) (PLL)-stearic acid-substituted (PLL-StA) and Lipofectamine 2000 (Lipo), in which pretreatment
of cells with ABCB1 siRNA led to a 2-fold to 3-fold increase in DOX uptake by cells. Little difference was detected in the DOX
uptake of ABCB1 versus control siRNA-treated cells with polyethylenimine (PEI). NT indicates nontreated cells.

Figure 6. Doxorubicin (DOX) and paclitaxel (PTX) cytotoxicity is illustrated in multidrug resistance 1 (MDR1) cells that were
treated with ABCB1 small interfering RNA (siRNA)-carrier complexes, as determined by 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl2H-tetrazolium bromide assay. (A) For cells that were treated with DOX, poly(L)-lysine (PLL)-stearic acid-substituted (PLL-StA)
had the highest efficiency, leading to an increase of approximately 30% in cytotoxicity of the ABCB1-treated cells. Polyethylenimine (PEI) led to nonspecific cytotoxicity in MDR1 cells, and Lipofectamine 2000 (Lipo) led to a 20% increase in cytotoxicity at
the lowest DOX concentration. (B) In PTX-treated cells, PLL-StA and Lipo had the highest efficiency, leading to an increase of
approximately 20% in cytotoxicity after ABCB1-siRNA treatment. Like in DOX-treated cells, PEI lead to nonspecific cytotoxicity in
PTX-treated cells. NT indicates nontreated cells.

P-gp Down-Regulation for Cancer Therapy/Abbasi et al

Other investigators also have attempted to use P-gp
suppression by siRNA to reverse MDR. By using the
MCF-7 breast cancer cell line, Stierle et al observed up to
60% P-gp suppression using siRNA delivery with Oligofectamine. This led to a 20% increase in drug uptake in
these cells.16 Others also reported successful down-regulation of P-gp in these cells, including 65% P-gp suppression using Oligofectamine36 and 60% to 80%
suppression using Lipofectamine 2000.17 However, those
2 studies did not report on drug accumulation inside the
cells, and it is not known whether P-gp suppression
resulted in a functional outcome. By using coblock
copolymers suitable for micellazation, our previous studies yielded 50% to 60% P-gp suppression in the same
MDA435/LCC6/MDR1 cells after siRNA delivery.30
Finally, Zhang et al produced 30% to 55% P-gp suppression with Oligofectamine in various ovarian cancer cell
lines, albeit without reporting on drug accumulation in
cells.20 Our P-gp suppression results using lipid-modified
polymers are comparable to data in the literature on nonviral delivery, because we were able to suppress P-gp by
50% to 60% using PLL-StA for siRNA delivery. Lipofectamine 2000 (a carrier similar to Oligofectamine) produced variable results in our hands for P-gp suppression
and did not lead to a significant increase in drug uptake. It
is noteworthy that siRNA delivery by PEI-OA did not
result in improvements in the down-regulation of P-gp
suppression in the current study. In a previous report, we
obtained effective siRNA delivery against integrin av in
B16 melanoma cells with PEI-OA.21 Possible differences
in cell types and the target gene could explain the differences between these 2 studies.
The current results demonstrated that using lipidmodified PLL for the delivery of gene-specific siRNAs is
an effective approach for down-regulating specific molecular targets. This study demonstrated an effective accumulation of chemotherapeutic agents in cells after P-gp
suppression and increased cytotoxicity of both DOX and
PTX, 2 issues that have not been addressed clearly by
other nonviral approaches to siRNA delivery. Therefore,
as concern increases over the use of viral carriers in cancer
therapy, lipid-substituted polymeric carriers may be safe
delivery systems.
