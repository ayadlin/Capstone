Germline BAP1 mutations predispose to several cancers, in particular malignant mesothelioma.
Mesothelioma is an aggressive malignancy generally associated to professional exposure to
asbestos. However, to date we found that none of the mesothelioma patients carrying germline
BAP1 mutations were professionally exposed to asbestos. We hypothesized that germline BAP1
mutations might influence the asbestos-induced inflammatory response that is linked to asbestos
carcinogenesis, thereby increasing the risk of developing mesothelioma after minimal exposure.
Using a BAP1+/− mouse model, we found that, compared to their wild type littermates, BAP1+/−
mice exposed to low-dose asbestos fibers showed significant alterations of the peritoneal
inflammatory response, including significantly higher levels of pro-tumorigenic alternatively
polarized M2 macrophages, and lower levels of several chemokines and cytokines. Consistent with
these data, BAP1+/− mice had a significantly higher incidence of mesothelioma after exposure to
very low doses of asbestos, doses that rarely induced mesothelioma in wild type mice. Our
findings suggest that minimal exposure to carcinogenic fibers may significantly increase the risk
of malignant mesothelioma in genetically predisposed individuals carrying germline BAP1
mutations, possibly via alterations of the inflammatory response.

Introduction

Author Manuscript

Malignant mesothelioma (MM) is a deadly cancer usually localized to the pleural and
peritoneal linings1. In the US and in the UK, ~3 200 and ~2 500 individuals are diagnosed
and die with MM each year, respectively2, 3. About 60–70% of mesotheliomas have been
associated to exposure to carcinogenic mineral fibers, mainly asbestos1. Nevertheless, the
risk of developing MM in high-risk cohorts professionally exposed to asbestos is ~5%,
suggesting that other factors contribute to MM pathogenesis1. Mineral fibers promote
mesothelioma inducing a chronic inflammatory reaction: on one hand this results in the
production of mutagenic oxygen and nitrogen radicals, and on the other hand it provides
damaged mesothelial cells with important survival signals4. Although chronic inflammation
has been associated with the pathogenesis of several cancers, competent inflammatory cells
also provide immunosurveillance, the host’s protection process against nascent transformed
cells expressing altered antigens5. In fact, different functional and phenotypical cell subtypes
are associated to anti-tumoral or pro-tumoral immunity6. Macrophages (MΦ) can undergo
different types of polarization based on the kind and levels of cytokines present in the local
tissue environment. Classically activated (M1) MΦ have a pro-inflammatory anti-tumoral
phenotype, while alternatively activated (M2) MΦ are involved in immunosuppression and
tissue repair7. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) represent one of the major populations
of immune cells infiltrating tumors, and usually acquire functional characteristics similar to
M2 MΦ8. The ratio between M2-like and M1-like TAM has prognostic value in MM and
other cancers, with the former usually associated with a worse prognosis9–11. However, the
contribution of different MΦ subpopulations to the initiation of inflammation-induced
cancers is still unclear. MM has a large number of TAM, suggesting that they play an
important role in this malignancy12.

Recently, we identified germline mutations in the tumor suppressor gene BRCA1 associated
protein-1 (BAP1) as causative of a novel hereditary cancer syndrome characterized by a very
high risk of MM, uveal and cutaneous melanoma, several other malignancies, and
characteristic benign melanocytic tumors we named MBAITs13–15. The penetrance of the
BAP1 cancer syndrome is ~100%, and several patients carrying germline BAP1 mutations
develop multiple cancers16. Notably, none of the germline BAP1 heterozygous patients who
developed MM reported professional exposure to asbestos fibers13, 16, suggesting that either
these MMs were not caused by asbestos, or that minimal amounts of asbestos – as in the
case of some indoor exposure17 or naturally occurring outdoor environmental exposure18 –
may be sufficient to cause MM in germline BAP1 mutation carriers. Here, we
experimentally tested in a BAP1+/− murine model whether germline BAP1 heterozygosity
would result in alterations of the asbestos-induced inflammatory response, and whether low
doses of asbestos might be sufficient to cause MM.
We used constitutive BAP1+/− mice (C57BL/6 background) generated by breeding mice
with loxP sites flanking BAP1 exons 4 and 5 with mice expressing a constitutive general Cre
deleter19. While homozygous BAP1 deficiency in mice results in embryonic lethality19,
BAP1+/− mice are viable and healthy. Compared to wild type littermates, BAP1+/− mice
expressed about half the amount of BAP1 protein in relevant tissues (Suppl. Fig 1).

In our experiments, we used 10–12 weeks old mice of either sex equally distributed in the
experimental groups using a computational random number generator. All the experiments
were approved by the University of Hawai’i Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee
(IACUC). Unless otherwise specified, results are presented as median [interquartile range].

First, we exposed BAP1+/− mice and BAP1+/+ for five weeks to receive injections with glass
beads or a low amount of crocidolite asbestos fibers (0.05 mg/week). After performing a
peritoneal lavage, we counted the total number of peritoneal cells and determined via flow
cytometry the percentage of total and subset-specific leukocytes. CD45+ leukocytes
represented 95–99% of the total cells recovered in each group. In the glass control groups,
macrophages and B cells represented the most abundant population, regardless of genotype
(Table 1). Upon exposure to low-dose crocidolite fibers, the cellular inflammatory response
was largely overlapping in mice with either genotype. We observed a significant increase in
total number of leukocytes and in the relative percentage of neutrophils, and, at the same
time, a significant decrease in the percentage of B cells and macrophages (Table 1). Further
characterization of the cell types revealed that exposure to crocidolite fibers induced
significant alterations in macrophages polarization in BAP1+/− mice (Fig. 1a). In the
macrophages from BAP1+/− mice exposed to asbestos fibers, the normalized mean
fluorescence intensity (MFI) for CD206 (marker of M2 macrophages) was significantly
higher compared to controls (197.1% [160.6–256.8] vs 163.1% [125.4–186.7], P < 0.05),
whereas the normalized MFI for CD86 (marker of M1 macrophages) was significantly lower
compared to controls (74.6% [57.6–90.3] vs 95.8% [77.4–109.1], P < 0.05) (Fig. 1b).
Accordingly, the percentage of M1 macrophages (CD206-CD86+ cells) was significantly
lower in BAP1+/− mice (43.2% [28.9–44.9] vs 67.3% [46.7–78.2] of total macrophages, P <
0.05). On the other hand, the percentage of M2 macrophages (defined as CD206+ CD86cells) was significantly higher in BAP1+/− mice compared to wild type littermates (3.8%
[2.1–6.8] vs 1.2% [0.5–3.6%] of total macrophages, P < 0.05). Double positive (CD206+
CD86+) macrophages, which represent a transition state from M1 to M2, were also more
represented in BAP1+/− mice compared to wild type littermates (40.0% [30.7–47.0] vs
26.0% [13.3–37.6] of total macrophages, P < 0.05) (Fig. 1c). Moreover, the M2/M1 ratio
(overall percentage of CD206+ cells divided by overall percentage of CD86+ cells) was
significantly higher in asbestos-exposed BAP1+/− mice compared to controls (0.54 [0.48–
0.66] vs 0.36 [0.16–0.56], P < 0.05) (Fig. 1d).

Next, we compared the profiles of cytokines and chemokines present in peritoneal lavages of
these same mice. Compared to wild type littermates, the levels of monocyte chemoattractant
protein-1 (MCP-1) were significantly lower in BAP1+/− mice exposed to glass (2.5 pg/mL
[2.3–5.2] vs 33.6 pg/mL [6.5–51.7], P < 0.01) and in BAP1+/− mice exposed to asbestos
(52.4 pg/mL [4.7–113.4] vs 178.5 pg/mL [102.9–373.2], P < 0.05) (Fig. 2a). Analogously,
compared to wild type littermates, the levels of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) were
significantly lower in the BAP1+/− mice exposed to glass (0.9 pg/mL [0.9–1.0] vs 6.9 pg/mL
[1.1–13.5], P < 0.01), and in the BAP1+/− mice exposed to asbestos (78.2 pg/mL [41.0–
134.4] vs 201.9 pg/mL [116.9–274.8], P < 0.05) (Fig. 2b). Moreover, lavages from BAP1+/−
mice exposed to asbestos contained significantly lower amounts of keratinocyte-derived

chemokine (KC) compared to wild type littermates (253.4 pg/mL [19.5–557.1] vs 675.3
pg/mL [469.8–1741.5], P < 0.05) (Fig. 2c). We also observed that eotaxin levels were
significantly lower in BAP1+/− mice compared to wild type littermates in the glass exposed
control group (1.73 ng/mL [1.11–2.06] vs 3.27 ng/mL [1.94–3.92], P < 0.05); the same
trend, although non-significant, was retained following asbestos exposure (3.33 ng/mL
[2.56–4.33] vs 4.70 ng/mL [3.13–6.30], P = 0.28) (Fig. 2d). Levels of IL-6 also differed
between genotypes upon asbestos exposure, though this difference did not reach nominal
significance (P = 0.08) (Fig. 2e). Both IL-6 and LIF belong to the IL-6 family of cytokines,
and in our samples their levels significantly correlated (R2 = 0.62, P < 0.0001) (Fig. 2f).
Finally, levels of G-CSF, IL-5, IP-10, and VEGF significantly increased after asbestos
exposure, independently of the genotype (Suppl. Fig 2a-d). Levels of several other cytokines
were below the lower limit of detection of our assay. Together, these results indicated that
germline BAP1 heterozygosity significantly influenced the peritoneal inflammatory
response upon asbestos exposure.

Therefore, we sought to experimentally study the relationship between asbestos dosage and
MM carcinogenesis in the context of BAP1 heterozygosis. Based on previous publications
on murine models20, 21, and on our own experience (Carbone, unpublished observations),
doses of asbestos ranging from 3 to 5 mg induce MM in ~20–40% of exposed animals,
while 0.5 mg of asbestos induce MM in 0–10% of exposed animals. BAP1+/+ mice and
BAP1+/− mice received ten weekly injections of 0.5 mg of crocidolite asbestos fibers (total
of 5 mg, referred to as “standard-dose” as it is the dose most commonly used to induced
MM in rodents), 0.05 mg of crocidolite fibers (total of 0.5 mg, referred to as “low-dose”), or
0.5 mg of inert glass beads (total of 5 mg, negative control). During the 13 months of follow
up after the last injection, we did not observe MM or any other spontaneous tumor in the
glass control groups. In mice exposed to asbestos fibers, MM was the only malignancy
observed. In the low-dose group, crocidolite fibers caused pathologically confirmed MM in
9/25 (36.0%) BAP1+/− mice compared to 5/50 (10.0%) BAP1+/+ mice (P = 0.010). Similarly,
in the standard-dose group, MM was diagnosed in 15/25 (60.0%) BAP1+/− mice compared
to 14/50 (28.0%) BAP1+/+ mice (P = 0.011) (Fig. 3a). Immunohistochemical staining of the
tumors revealed expression of the mesothelial marker WT1 (Fig. 3b), supporting the
histologic diagnosis of MM. In sporadic human MM, somatic BAP1 inactivation is one of
the most frequent events, and it has been reported in about 40–60% of the cases13, 22–27.
Consistent with these human data, BAP1 nuclear staining was absent in all MM analyzed
arising from BAP1+/− mice and in 66.7% from BAP1+/+ mice (Fig. 3c). With regard to
histology, all the MMs we observed in human germline BAP1 mutation carriers were
epithelioid13. In sporadic human MMs, several groups have reported that mutations of BAP1
occur primarily in epithelioid MM24, 25, although this is not unequivocal28. All the MMs we
observed in our BAP1+/− and BAP1+/+ mice displayed, totally or partially, sarcomatoid
features. This is likely due to interspecies differences, since sarcomatoid features, contrary
to what happens in human MMs, were also prevalent in MMs arising from other independent
murine models of asbestos-induced MM29, 30. BAP1+/− mice had also a significantly shorter
survival, i.e. life-span, compared to BAP1+/+ mice, both in the low-dose (P < 0.01) and the
standard-dose group (P < 0.001) (Fig. 3d).

Discussion

Taken together, our results showed that germline BAP1 heterozygosity is associated with a
significantly altered peritoneal inflammatory response upon exposure to asbestos fibers and
to an increased risk of MM following exposure to minimal amounts of asbestos that rarely
cause MM in wild type animals. BAP1 is a nuclear deubiquitinating enzyme and an
important epigenetic regulator via deubiquitination of histone H2A31. Originally discovered
in 199832, it has several cell-intrinsic tumor suppressive functions, such as regulation of
gene transcription33, cell cycle and replication34–36, and DNA damage response37, 38. BAP1
knockdown in MM cell lines has been paradoxically associated to a decreased proliferation,
with an accumulation of cells in the S phase of the cell cycle22, suggesting that BAP1 loss
might promote tumorigenesis inducing a delayed, but more permissive, G1/S checkpoint22.
Heterozygous germline mutations of other important tumor suppressor genes, such as
BRCA1, CDKN2A, and RB1, increase risk of cancer specifically to one or very few
anatomical sites39. One of the few tumor suppressor genes whose germline heterozygosity,
similar to BAP1, is associated to increased risk of cancer to several sites is TP53, which
encodes p5339. Besides its well-known intrinsic functions, recently a novel non-cellautonomous tumor suppressor effect of p53 has been described, via regulation of
macrophage polarization and cytokine release40. Our results suggest that germline BAP1
heterozygosity, similarly to TP53, influences in vivo macrophage polarization and cytokine
release. Indeed, BAP1+/− mice exposed to asbestos had significantly more M2-like protumoral macrophages. Also, the chemokines MCP-1 and KC, and two cytokines of the IL-6
family (IL-6 itself and LIF) are soluble mediators significantly reduced in BAP1+/− mice
exposed to asbestos. MCP-1 and IL-6 have been reported to increase following asbestos
exposure and have been linked to asbestos pathogenesis41, 42. Our results support these
findings and also suggest that this inflammatory response might be associated with increased
immunosurveillance, since lower levels of these and other inflammatory mediators in
BAP1+/− mice are associated with higher M2/M1 macrophage ratio and higher MM
incidence following asbestos exposure. Interestingly, BAP1 has been recently showed to
regulate the myeloid stem cell compartment via complex alterations of the transcriptional
profile, possibly via its interaction with transcriptional co-regulators such as Host Cell
Factor-1 (HCF-1) and Additional Sex Combs Like-1 (ASXL1)19.

Altogether, our results suggest a novel, complex model of asbestos-induced MM
pathogenesis, in which the chronic inflammatory response can have preferentially antitumoral or pro-tumoral roles, depending on the cellular and soluble mediators involved. To
explain the observed intra- and inter-familial variability of cancer types in germline BAP1
mutated carriers, we hypothesized that MM might be more prevalent in individuals/families
exposed to low levels of asbestos15, levels that are not, or only marginally, carcinogenic for
the population at large. Our results support our hypothesis, as we found that 36% of
BAP1+/− mice exposed to low doses of asbestos developed MM, compared to 10% of wild
type mice. Moreover, we found that MM is significantly more frequent in BAP1+/− mice
exposed to standard doses of asbestos. This finding corroborates the recent results of Xu et
al. that were obtained in an independent murine model29. Both studies found a shorter
lifespan of asbestos exposed BAP1 heterozygous mice compared to wild type littermates,

suggesting that BAP1+/− mice might develop MM at an earlier age compared to wild type
littermates. Similarly, individuals carrying germline BAP1 mutations are diagnosed with
MM at a much younger age compared to sporadic MM cases (mean age 55 years vs 72
years, respectively)16. Accordingly, although MMs in carriers of germline BAP1 mutations
are less aggressive and are associated with survivals from diagnosis of 5–10 years16,
compared to an average of 1 year in sporadic MM patients, the former die at an earlier age
compared to the latter. Survival from diagnosis could not be evaluated in our model, as per
IACUC requirements, mice were euthanized at the first clinical evidences of disease.
Mechanistically, Xu et al. suggest that the increased MM incidence in BAP1 heterozygous
mice was partially related to BAP1-dependent transcriptional regulation of the tumor
suppressor retinoblastoma protein29. Our findings expand what was previously reported by
implicating novel tumor suppressor effects of BAP1 mediated via the microenvironment.

Author Manuscript

Moreover, we discovered that BAP1+/− mice exposed to low doses of asbestos developed
MMs at a similar rate as BAP1+/+ mice exposed to 10 times higher doses. Therefore,
although it is not possible to directly compare the low-dose exposure in mice to indoor
and/or outdoor environmental exposure in humans, our findings support our hypothesis that
germline BAP1 heterozygosity increases susceptibility to the carcinogenic effects of low
doses of asbestos.

Author Manuscript

Based on our results, we suggest that prevention programs of MM in individuals carrying
germline BAP1 mutations should focus on reducing exposure to even minimal sources of
carcinogenic fibers, levels that are within the acceptable “safe” limits for the population at
large (0.1 fibers/cc of air as an eight-hour time-weighted average, as per US Occupational
Safety & Health Administration standards43). Finally, while our model focuses on asbestos
as a trigger, this novel non-cell-autonomous tumor suppressive function of BAP1 may not be
restricted to the peritoneal compartment or to the asbestos stimulation, and may contribute to
the large numbers and diverse types of tumors that arises in carriers of the BAP1 cancer
syndrome.

Figure 2. Several cytokines and chemokines are differentially expressed in lavage from BAP1+/−
mice

The supernatants recovered from the peritoneal lavages were concentrated 45–60 times
using Amicon Ultra Centrifuge Filters with a 3,000 Dalton cutoff. Levels of 32 cytokines
and chemokines were detected in concentrated lavages using human cytokine multiplex kits
(EMD Millipore Corporation, Billerica, MA). Levels of MCP-1 (a), LIF (b), KC (c), eotaxin
(d) and IL-6 (e) in lavages from BAP1 wild type and heterozygous mice after short-term
exposure to glass beads or crocidolite fibers. Comparisons between heterozygous and wild
type groups were calculated using Mann-Whitney U test for rank comparisons. * (P < 0.05),

Briefly, BAP1+/+ mice (n = 50 per group) and BAP1+/− mice (n = 25 per group) were
injected intraperitoneally every week for ten weeks with 0.05 mg (low dose) or 0.5 mg
(standard dose) of UICC crocidolite. 0.5 mg of glass beads were injected at the same
schedule as control. Sample size was estimated to detect a difference in MM incidence
between the low-exposed groups ≥ 25%. Mice were monitored daily for clinical evidence of
abdominal swelling, and euthanized in presence of respiratory distress, gait instability,
unresponsiveness to pain stimuli, or when tumor burden was obvious. Upon detection of
illness, mice were sacrificed by CO2 asphyxiation, and all the major organs were evaluated
histologically. (a) MM incidence in BAP1+/− mice and wild type littermates after long-term
exposure to glass beads or asbestos fibers (standard and low dose) was compared using
Fisher’s exact test. * (P < 0.05) (b) Formalin-fixed/paraffin-embedded samples were cut into
5 μm sections and stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) according to standard
procedure. The pathological diagnosis of mesothelioma was based on H&E staining and
supported by WT1 nuclear staining in tumor cells. H&E and immunostainings were blindly
interpreted by M.C and A.P., both US board specialized pathologists with expertise in
human and animal mesotheliomas14, 45, 46 (c) Tumors were also stained with a rabbit
polyclonal anti-BAP1 antibody to evaluate presence and localization of BAP1. (d) Survival
curves of BAP1+/− mice and wild type littermates after long-term exposure to asbestos fibers
(standard and low dose) were compared using log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test. . ** (P < 0.01),
*** (P < 0.001). The experiment was performed one time.

sacrificed by CO2 asphyxiation, and the abdominal cavity was washed with 5 ml of PBS. The peritoneal cells obtained were pelleted and supernatant was
removed for later cytokine analysis. Cells were blindly characterized with the following antibodies: CD45 (leukocytes; anti-CD45-BV711, 563709, BD
Biosciences), F4/80 (MΦ; anti-F4/80-AlexaFluor®488, MCA497A488T, AbD Serotec), Ly-6G (neutrophils; anti-Ly6G-BV421, 562737, BD

between groups were calculated using Mann-Whitney U test for rank comparisons. Results are presented as median [interquartile range].

BAP1+/− mice (n = 7 per group) and BAP1+/+ (n = 9 per group) were injected intraperitoneally every week for five weeks with 0.05 mg of inert glass
