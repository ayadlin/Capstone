S6 Kinase 2 Promotes Breast Cancer Cell Survival via Akt
Savitha Sridharan and Alakananda Basu

Abstract
The 40S ribosomal protein S6 kinase (S6K) acts downstream of mTOR, which plays important roles in cell
proliferation, protein translation, and cell survival and is a target for cancer therapy. mTOR inhibitors are,
however, of limited success. Although Akt is believed to act upstream of mTOR, persistent inhibition of p70 S6
kinase or S6K1 can activate Akt via a negative feedback loop. S6K exists as two homologues, S6K1 and S6K2, but
little is known about the function of S6K2. In the present study, we have examined the effects of S6K2 on Akt
activation and cell survival. Silencing of S6K1 caused a modest decrease, whereas knockdown of S6K2 caused a
substantial increase in TNF-a and TRAIL (TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand)-mediated apoptosis. In
contrast to S6K1, depletion of S6K2 by siRNA decreased basal and TNF-induced Akt phosphorylation. Ectopic
expression of constitutively active Akt in MCF-7 cells restored cell survival in S6K2-depleted cells. We have
previously shown that activation of Akt induces downregulation of Bid via p53. Knockdown of S6K2 caused an
increase in p53, and downregulation of p53 by siRNA decreased Bid level. Silencing of Bid blunted the ability of
S6K2 deficiency to enhance TNF-induced apoptosis. Taken together, our study shows that the two homologues
of S6K have distinct effects on Akt activation and cell survival. Thus, targeting S6K2 may be an effective
therapeutic strategy to treat cancers. Cancer Res; 71(7); 2590–9. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
Akt or protein kinase B (PKB), a serine/threonine kinase, is
the cellular homologue of the oncogene product v-Akt (1). It is
activated downstream of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) in
response to growth factors or cytokines. Akt performs diverse
cellular functions, including cell growth, proliferation, and
survival (2). It is deregulated in many cancers, including breast
cancer, and confers resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs (3).
Phosphorylation of Akt at Thr308 and Ser473 sites results in its
activation (4).
TNF-a was originally identified as a cytokine that induces
necrosis in tumors and regression of cancer in animals (5). It
causes selective destruction of tumor tissues but has no effect
on normal tissues (6). The presence of antiapoptotic proteins,
however, can counteract cell death mediated by TNF. It has
been reported that TNF causes activation of Akt through
phosphorylation at Ser473 (7). Binding of TNF to its cell
surface receptors causes activation of initiator caspase-8,
followed by activation of effector caspases such as caspase3 and caspase-7, resulting in the cleavage of critical cellular
proteins and cell death (8, 9). Although caspase-8 is the apical
caspase in the death receptor pathway, there is cross-talk

between the receptor-initiated and mitochondrial pathways
(10–12). The members of the Bcl-2 family proteins play
important roles in regulating the intrinsic or mitochondrial
cell death pathway (13, 14). Caspase-8 catalyzes the cleavage of
the Bcl-2 family protein Bid (10–12). The truncated Bid (tBid)
translocates to mitochondria, causing release of cytochrome c
and activation of caspase-9 (10–12). It has been reported that
Akt can exert its antiapoptotic function by inhibiting the
function of proapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins (15–20).
Several cellular functions of Akt are mediated by mTOR,
which is considered the master controller of protein synthesis
and cell proliferation (21). Activated Akt can phosphorylate
and inactivate tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (TSC2), which
negatively regulates mTOR (22). mTOR interacts with either
raptor or rictor to form mTOR complex I (mTORC1) or mTOR
complex 2 (mTORC2), respectively (22). While phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1), which acts downstream of
PI3K, phosphorylates Akt at Thr308 site, rictor complexed
with mTORC2 can phosphorylate Akt at Ser473 (22). mTORC1
is inhibited by rapamycin, which is currently being tested for
use in cancer therapy, albeit with limited success (23).
The 40S ribosomal protein S6 kinase (S6K) is a downstream
target of mTORC1 (24). S6K is represented by 2 homologous
cellular proteins, S6K1 and S6K2, both of which act downstream of mTOR and phosphorylate S6 (25). Persistent inhibition of S6K1 has been shown to activate Akt via feedback
inhibition of the PI3K pathway wherein S6K1 phosphorylates
several sites on IRS-1 (insulin receptor substrate-1) and inhibits it (26–30). The limited therapeutic efficacy of rapamycin
and its analogues has been attributed to the activation of
Akt via this negative feedback loop due to inhibition of S6K1
(26, 29) and the inability of rapamycin to completely activate

4E-BP (eIF4E-binding protein), another downstream target of
mTORC1 (31–33).
Although there are 2 homologues of S6K (25, 34), most of the
studies have been focused on S6K1 and little is known about
the function of S6K2. S6K1-deficient mice phosphorylated S6
but had a small body phenotype (35). S6K1/2 double-knockout
mice also exhibit normal proliferation and growth reduction
(36). Similarly, S6K1/2 double-knockout mouse embryo fibroblasts and myoblasts show defects in size but not proliferation
(31, 36, 37). These results suggest that these 2 homologues
have redundant as well as nonoverlapping functions. It has
been reported that S6K2 but not S6K1 was important for
fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF 2)-induced chemoresistance of
small cell lung cancer cells (38). A recent study showed that
S6K2 but not S6K1 was important for cell proliferation in
response to mTOR activation (39).
Since the Akt/mTOR/S6K axis plays a critical role in cell
survival, yet targeting mTOR has been of limited success due to
feedback activation of Akt, we have examined whether the 2
homologues of S6 kinase perform distinct functions in mediating breast cancer cell survival. We report for the first time that
S6K2 regulates cell survival via the Akt pathway. We have shown
that in contrast to S6K1, silencing of S6K2 inhibits Akt and
induces cell death via the proapoptotic Bcl-2 family protein Bid.
Thus, selective targeting of S6K2 rather than mTOR or S6K1
may be a more effective therapeutic strategy to treat cancers.

Results
S6K homologues exhibit distinct effects on TNF-induced
apoptosis in breast cancer MCF-7 cells
Since S6K1 is overexpressed in MCF-7 breast cancer cells
(42) and has been associated with chemoresistance (43, 44),
we examined whether S6K1 confers resistance to TNF in MCF7 breast cancer cells. Figure 1A shows that silencing of S6K1 by
siRNA caused a modest decrease rather than an increase in the
cleavage of PARP in response to TNF. Since there are 2 S6K
homologues, we examined the effect of S6K2 knockdown on
TNF-induced cell death. As shown in Figure 1B, depletion of

distinct effects on breast cancer
cell survival. MCF-7 cells were
transfected with control (Con)
nontargeting siRNA and either
S6K1 (A) or S6K2 (B) siRNA and

concentrations of TNF. Western

85-kDa cleaved PARP. C, MCF-7
cells transfected with control,

Cells were then stained with YOPRO-1 (green) to detect apoptotic
cells and PI (red) to detect necrotic
cells, using a fluorescence
microscope. Merged figures are
shown. Results are representative
of 3 independent experiments.

S6K2 caused a substantial increase in TNF-induced cleavage of
the 116-kDa full-length PARP to the 85-kDa form. We also
monitored the effect of S6K1 and S6K2 knockdown on cell
death by staining cells with YO-PRO-1 and PI (Fig. 1C).
Apoptotic cells are permeable to the green fluorescent dye
YO-PRO-1, whereas PI (red) is taken up only by necrotic and
late apoptotic cells. S6K2 depletion increased the number of
YO-PRO-1/PI-stained cells in response to TNF and TRAIL
(TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand), whereas S6K1 depletion seems to decrease it. Thus, the 2 S6K homologues had
distinct effects on TNF- and TRAIL-induced cell death.

shown to negatively regulate Akt via a feedback loop (26, 28–
30), we examined whether knockdown of S6K1 enhances TNFinduced activation of Akt in MCF-7 cells. Figure 2 shows that
depletion of S6K1 in MCF-7 breast cancer cells enhanced
phosphorylation of Akt. In contrast to S6K1, knockdown of
S6K2 decreased basal and TNF-induced Akt phosphorylation
(Fig. 3A). On the basis of densitometric scanning of 4 independent experiments, knockdown of S6K2 decreased basal
and TNF-induced Akt phosphorylation at Ser473 by 40% and
60%, respectively (Fig. 3B).
We also examined the consequence of S6K2 knockdown on
Akt phosphorylation in ZR-75-1 and MDA-MB-231 breast
cancer cells (Fig. 3C and D). Knockdown of S6K2 decreased
Akt phosphorylation and enhanced PARP cleavage and caspase activation in ZR-75-1 cells (Fig. 3C). TNF had little effect
on cell death in MDA-MB-231 cells (data not shown). However,

examined the ability of CA-Akt to reverse the potentiation of
cell death caused by S6K2 depletion. Figure 4A shows that the
adenoviral vector-mediated delivery of CA-Akt in MCF-7 cells
decreased TNF-induced PARP cleavage compared with cells
transfected with adeno-GFP. While knockdown of S6K2
caused a substantial increase in TNF-induced PARP cleavage,
overexpression of CA-Akt inhibited TNF-induced PARP cleavage in S6K2-depleted cells. Similar results were obtained
when we monitored cell death by staining cells with
Annexin V and PI (Fig. 4B). These results suggest that S6K2
mediates its prosurvival effect via Akt.
Figure 2. Knockdown of S6K1 increased Akt phosphorylation. MCF-7
cells transfected with control (Con) nontargeting or S6K1 siRNA were
treated with indicated concentrations of TNF. Western blot analysis was
carried out with indicated antibodies.

S6K2 depletion failed to enhance cell death in response to
TRAIL in MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 3D). In contrast to MCF-7
cells, which lack caspase-3, ZR-75-1 and MDA-MB-231 cells
contain functional caspase-3. Since Akt is a substrate for
caspase-3, apoptotic stimuli can also induce cleavage of Akt
and this may contribute to decrease in Akt level in response to
TNF or TRAIL.
S6K2 promotes MCF-7 cell survival via Akt
Since knockdown of S6K2 inhibits Akt phosphorylation, we
examined whether S6K2 promotes cell survival via Akt. We

Knockdown of S6K2 enhanced cell death via Bid
Although TNF and TRAIL trigger cell death via the
receptor-initiated pathway, they can also amplify cell death
via the mitochondrial pathway (10–12). To determine the
mechanism(s) by which depletion of S6K2 potentiates TNFinduced cell death, we monitored TNF-induced caspase
activation and processing of Bid. Figure 5A shows that
TNF caused an increase in p-Akt, which was attenuated
by S6K2 knockdown. Depletion of S6K2 was associated with
enhanced processing of PARP and procaspase-8 in response
to TNF. This was accompanied by an increase in the
cleavage of Bid, a substrate for caspase-8 (10), and increased
processing of procaspase-9, the apical caspase of the mitochondrial cell death pathway. We also compared the effects

of S6K1 and S6K2 knockdown on cellular responses with
TRAIL (Fig. 5B). Knockdown of S6K2 had little effect on
caspase-8 inhibitor c-FLIP (Flice-like inhibitory protein), but
it enhanced processing of procaspase-8, procaspase-9, and
Bid (Fig. 5B).
To further validate our observation that S6K2 depletion
decreases Akt phosphorylation and increases cell death via
the mitochondrial pathway, we used 4 different siRNA
constructs against S6K2. Figure 5C shows that siRNAs 1,
3 and 4 against S6K2 decreased Akt phosphorylation,
enhanced PARP cleavage, and increased processing of procaspase-8 and procaspase-9 similar to S6K2 SMARTpool
siRNA. In contrast, siRNA 2 was less effective in attenuating
Akt phosphorylation and cleavage of PARP, caspase-8, and
caspase-9. Thus, a decrease in Akt phosphorylation by
S6K2 depletion was associated with an increase in PARP
cleavage.

Since programmed cell death 4 (PDCD4) has been implicated in TNF-induced apoptosis and acts as a tumor suppressor (45, 46), we have also examined the effects of S6K1 and
S6K-2 knockdown on the level of PDCD4. Silencing of S6K1 or
S6K2 effectively depleted the homologue and attenuated
phosphorylation of the substrate S6. However, while knockdown of S6K1 consistently increased PDCD4 level, depletion
of S6K2 had either no effect or decreased the level of PDCD4
modestly (Fig. 5D and data not shown). Thus, it is unlikely
that a decrease in the level of PDCD4 was responsible for the
potentiation of cell death caused by S6K2 knockdown.
We have previously shown that activation of Akt promotes
cell survival by downregulating Bid via p53 (17). We therefore
examined whether S6K2 knockdown affects p53 level. Figure 6
shows that knockdown of S6K2 enhanced TNF-induced p53
level and silencing of p53 decreased Bid level, suggesting that
S6K2 may regulate Bid via p53. Finally, to determine whether

Bid is indeed involved in the potentiation of cell death caused
by S6K2 knockdown, we examined whether S6K2 depletion
sensitizes cells to TNF when Bid is depleted. We compared the
effect of Bid with another proapoptotic Bcl-2 family member
Bax. Figure 7 shows that knockdown of Bid abolished TNFinduced PARP cleavage. In addition, knockdown of Bid but not
Bax attenuated the ability of S6K2 to enhance TNF-induced
PARP cleavage. These results suggest that the mechanism by
which S6K2 potentiates receptor-mediated apoptosis involves
the proapoptotic protein Bid.

Discussion
The results of our present study show that the 2 S6K

breast cancer cell survival. While it has been reported that

S6K1 can negatively regulate Akt via a negative feedback
loop, we report for the first time that depletion of S6K2
inhibits Akt activity and promotes breast cancer cell death
via the mitochondrial cell death pathway that involves the
Bcl-2 family protein Bid.
It is generally believed that activation of PI3K/Akt stimulates
the mTOR pathway by phosphorylating and inactivating the
tumor suppressor protein TSC2, which negatively regulates
mTOR activity. mTOR is required for estrogen-induced breast
tumor cell proliferation (47), and constitutive signaling
through the mTOR pathway is a cause of treatment failure
in breast cancer patients (48). S6K1, a downstream target of
mTOR, is an important mediator of mTOR function (49).
Elevation/activation of S6K has been associated with several
cancers and resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs (42, 44, 50,
51). The S6K1 gene is amplified in approximately 9% of primary
breast cancers (52), and S6K1 mRNA is elevated in almost 40%
of the tumors (42). The status of the activated S6K1 was shown
to be a predictor of patient's survival and treatment response
(42, 50, 53). Recently, it has been reported that S6K1 promotes
breast cancer cell proliferation by phosphorylating ERa (estrogen receptor a), leading to its transcriptional activation (54).
Thus, we anticipated that knockdown of S6K1 would enhance
cell death in breast cancer cells. To our surprise, depletion of
S6K1 caused a modest decrease in cell death in response to
TNF. Our results are, however, consistent with the recent
reports that S6K1 deficiency protects against death receptor–mediated apoptosis in hepatocytes (55) and mTOR/
S6K1 activates p53-dependent cell death in response to DNA
damage (56). As has been reported earlier that persistent
inhibition of mTOR/S6K1 can activate Akt via a negative
feedback loop (26, 28–30), we also found that depletion of
S6K1 resulted in an increase in TNF-induced Akt phosphorylation and this may explain why S6K1 knockdown inhibits rather
than potentiates TNF-induced cell death.
Although most of the published reports have focused on
S6K1, there are 2 homologues of S6K, S6K1 and S6K2, that act
downstream of mTOR (25, 34). While these homologues share
overall similarity in structure and exhibit redundant functions,
there are also important differences. S6K2 has been shown to
potentiate IL3 (interleukin 3)-mediated mitogenic response
(57). A recent study has shown that S6K2 but not S6K1
interacts with heterogeneous ribonucleoproteins (hnRNP)
F/H to drive cell proliferation (39). We have consistently
found that in contrast to S6K1, depletion of S6K2 caused a
dramatic increase in TNF- and TRAIL-induced apoptosis,
suggesting that S6K2 functions as a prosurvival protein.
TNF has been shown to activate mTOR signaling (58), and
we have found that TNF preferentially activates S6K1 (data
not shown), presumably because the abundance of S6K1 is
much greater than that of S6K2 in MCF-7 cells. We made a
novel observation that in contrast to S6K1, S6K2 positively
regulates Akt. Knockdown of S6K2 caused a decrease in basal
and TNF-induced Akt phosphorylation, which is indicative of
its activation status, suggesting that S6K2 promotes cell
survival via activation of Akt. In fact, overexpression of CAAkt blocked increase in cell death caused by S6K2 depletion,
suggesting that S6K2 acts upstream of Akt, although

Antiapoptotic Signaling by S6K2

we cannot rule out the possibility that Akt and S6K2 act in
parallel pathways where Akt has a dominant role over S6K2.
There are several potential mechanisms by which S6K2
affects phosphorylation/activity of Akt. Since mTORC2 activates Akt by phosphorylating at the hydrophobic site, it is
conceivable that knockdown of S6K2 decreases Akt phosphorylation by inhibiting mTORC2. Others and we have also shown
that Ser473 phosphorylation of Akt is also regulated by DNAdependent protein kinase (41). Since PTEN inhibits PI3K/Akt,
another possibility is that S6K2 knockdown increases PTEN
level, resulting in inhibition of Akt. It has been reported that a
major kinase downstream of mTORC2 is serum- and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase (SGK1; ref. 59). Thus, it is also
important to determine whether S6K2 regulates cell survival
via SGK1. Moreover, since activation of Akt would lead to the
activation of mTORC1, there may be a positive feedback loop
between S6K2 and Akt. Thus, mTORC1 and its downstream
targets may mediate some of the effects of the potential
functional interaction between S6K2 and Akt. Future studies
should discern the mechanisms by which S6K2 regulates Akt
and the functional interaction between S6K2 and Akt.
Our results suggest that the mechanism by which S6K2
promotes cell survival via Akt involves the proapoptotic Bcl-2
family protein Bid. We have previously shown that activation
of Akt can cause a decrease in p53 levels in MCF-7 cells by
phosphorylating and stabilizing Hdm2 [(human homologue of
Mdm2 (murine double minute 2)], which degrades p53 via the
ubiquitin proteasome–mediated pathway (17). We have also
shown that Bid is a transcriptional target of p53 and Akt can
decrease Bid expression by inducing downregulation of p53
(17). The results of our present study show that knockdown of
S6K2 increased p53 and silencing of p53 was associated with a
decrease in Bid level. However, depletion of S6K2 was not
associated with upregulation of Bid. We have previously
shown that overexpression of Bid is sufficient to cause cell
death (19). Since Bid is a proapoptotic protein, an increase in
Bid level may also lead to its cleavage. Therefore, it may be
difficult to show an increase in Bid level. Nevertheless, knockdown of S6K2 had little effect on enhancing TNF-induced cell
death when Bid was depleted by siRNA silencing. Moreover,
knockdown of S6K2 failed to enhance cell death in MDA-MB231 cells, which express mutant p53. Thus, the mechanism by
which S6K2 promotes cell survival via Akt may involve downregulation of Bid.
S6K2 has also been implicated in FGF-mediated chemoresistance of small cell lung cancer H69 cells (38). It has been
reported that protein kinase C-e (PKCe) interacts with S6K2
and mediates the prosurvival effects of S6K2 via Raf/MAPK
(mitogen-activated protein kinase) signaling pathway by

increasing the levels of antiapoptotic proteins XIAP and
Bcl-xL (38). We were unable to detect a decrease in XIAP
and Bcl-xL levels in S6K-2–depleted MCF-7 cells (data not
shown), although we cannot rule out the possibility of other
Bcl-2 family members. Interestingly, we have previously shown
that PKCe also acts upstream of Akt during TNF-induced
apoptosis in MCF-7 breast cancer cells (41) and inhibits TNFand TRAIL-mediated apoptosis by increasing antiapoptotic
Bcl-2 and decreasing proapoptotic Bid levels (19). Moreover,
PKCe caused a decrease in Bid levels via Akt (17). Thus,
depending on the cellular context and apoptotic stimulus,
PKCe may promote cell survival either via the Raf/MEK/ERK
pathway or via the Akt signaling pathway.
Aberrations in Akt/mTOR/S6K pathway have been associated with many cancers. Consequently, this pathway is an
important target for cancer therapy. Rapamycin and its analogues that inhibit mTOR, however, were of limited success
(26–30). Since S6K1 and S6K2 seem to have opposite effects on
cell death, targeting mTOR, which acts upstream of both S6K1
and S6K2, may not be effective. Our observation that S6K2
rather than S6K1 is needed for the survival of breast cancer
cells has significant implications in the treatment of the
disease. Inhibition of S6K2 rather than of S6K1 should sensitize cancer cells to chemotherapeutic agents, providing a basis
for rational combination chemotherapy. Since Akt signaling
pathway is often deregulated in cancer, the observation that
knockdown of S6K2 results in inhibition of Akt shows positive
feedback regulation of Akt by S6K2 and has significant impact
in cancer therapy.
