ABSTRACT
Renal cell carcinoma (RCC), also called kidney cancer or renal adenocarcinoma, is
highly resistant to current treatments. It has been previously reported that a Kunitztype inhibitor domain-containing protein, isolated from the salivary glands of the
Amblyomma cajennense tick, triggers apoptosis in murine renal adenocarcinoma
cells (Renca) by inhibiting the proteasome and endoplasmic reticulum stress. Of
note, Amblyomin-X is the corresponding recombinant protein identified in the cDNA
library from A. cajennense salivary glands. Herein, using orthotopic kidney tumors in
mice, we demonstrate that Amblyomin-X is able to drastically reduce the incidence
of lung metastases by inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. The in vitro assays
show that Amblyomin-X is capable of reducing the proliferation rate of Renca cells,
promoting cell cycle arrest, and down-regulating the expression of crucial proteins
(cyclin D1, Ki67 and Pgp) involved in the aggressiveness and resistance of RCC.
Regarding non-tumor cells (NIH3T3), Amblyomin-X produced minor effects in the
cyclin D1 levels. Interestingly, observing the image assays, the fluorescence-labelled
Amblyomin-X was indeed detected in the tumor stroma whereas in healthy animals
it was rapidly metabolized and excreted. Taken the findings together, Amblyomin-X
can be considered as a potential anti-RCC drug candidate.

INTRODUCTION

RCC are a combining targeted therapy that includes
anti-angiogenic agents (tyrosine kinase inhibitors,
such as sorafenib, sunitinib, pazopanib, and axitinib),
or an anti-angiogenic antibody routinely employed
in combination with interferon alpha (bevacizumab)
[7, 8], and antiproliferative agents (mTOR inhibitors,
such as temsirolimus and everolimus) [9]. However, the
effectiveness of these therapies are associated with high
toxicity and, consequently, serious adverse events, and

Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is responsible for
approximately 2% of malignancies that affect adults
and for 90–95% of all kidney cancers [1, 2]. RCC
secretes proangiogenic cytokines, leading to the
activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway
and the overexpression of the proliferative protein Ki67 [3–6]. In this regard, the available treatments for

the progression-free survival (PFS) measured is limited
to two years [10]. In the setting of localized RCC disease,
surgery remains the mainstay of a good response [11].
Nonetheless, RCC has been considered as “immunogenic”
cancer [12], since some spontaneous remission eventually
can occur suggesting that the immune system may
play an important role in disease treatment [13]. In this
context, clinical trials involving immunotherapy based on
cytokines, such as interleukin 2 (IL-2) and/or interferonalpha (IFN-α), and also employing monoclonal antibodies,
such as nivolumab (anti-PD-1) and impilimumab (antiCTLA4), against immune check-points, have been
shown to enhance the antitumor immunity [14]. Another
complication regarding the RCC treatment is related to the
tumor cells genes overexpression, such as P-glycoprotein
(Pgp), which can confer multidrug resistance [15]. Thus,
the discovery of drug candidates that could be more
effective for treating this kind of disease is an urgent need.
Amblyomin-X (GenBank code: AAT68575), a
recombinant Kunitz-type protease inhibitor protein
(12.4 kDa) identified in the cDNA library from salivary
glands of the Amblyomma cajennense tick, has shown
to induce pro-apoptotic effects in different tumor cell
lines including murine renal adenocarnoma cells (Renca)
[16, 17]. However, in Renca cells only a small percent
of the cells upon Amblyomin-X treatment are positive to
propidium iodide (necrosis) [17]. In these in vitro studies,
Amblyomin-X was able to induce the activation of the
intrinsic apoptosis pathway (increase of cytochrome-c
and caspase-3, and reduction of Bcl-2 expression) through
proteasome inhibition and endoplasmic reticulum (ER)
stress [18, 19]. In a mouse melanoma model (primary
tumor), Amblyomin-X has shown antitumor activity and
an antithrombotic effect [20, 21]. Furthermore, it inhibits
the angiogenic capacities of the t-End endothelial cell
line in vitro [22] and produces an anti-angiogenic effect
in vivo in the dorsal skinfold chamber and chick embryo
chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assays [23].
Interestingly, the lack of suffering observed in t-End
cells as well as in murine and human fibroblasts treated
with Amblyomin-X may also support its tumor cell
selectivity [18, 19].
We have investigated, herein, the Amblyomin-X
pharmacology safety through an acute toxicity assay using
healthy mice. In addition, regarding animals orthotopically
implanted with renal cell carcinoma, the protein’s
tumor affinity and biodistribution  were also assessed
by employing in vivo  image approach. Moreover, in
vitro assays were performed using Renca and non-tumor
(NIH3T3) cells to measure the biomarkers protein-levels
in cell proliferation, apoptosis-cell death, and multi-drug
resistance, which have been reported as crucial points to
RCC therapeutic.
Summing up, our findings show that Amblyomin-X
can be rapidly eliminated by healthy animal systems,
and display antitumor activity in a selective fashion.

Also, the cyclin D1, Ki67, and Pgp protein levels were
down-regulated in Renca cells. Of note, a minor intensity
reduction only in cyclin D1 was observed in NIH3T3
cells. Regarding Renca cells, Amblyomin-X has promoted
cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, which was reinforced by
the Bcl-2 reduction in the orthotopic kidney tumor model.

RESULTS
Tissues of healthy animals remained preserved
after Amblyomin-X treatment
In healthy BALB/c mice, Ambly750S appeared in
the liver 30 min after administration. Its renal excretion
started 4 h later though (see Figure 1A). Regarding 26 h,
there was only a fluorescence trace in the renal region
and in the urinary tract. Likewise, in healthy BALB/c
mice treated with Amblyomin-X, using more than 100fold the effective dose, no behavior alterations, such
as vocalization, piloerection, coordination disorder or
alimentary disruptions (Figure 1B), were observed. In
addition, the brain, lung, heart, liver, spleen, and kidney
tissues had no histological lesions detected (Figure 1C).

Amblyomin-X reduces the renca cell
proliferation rate by cycle arrest
Amblyomin-X inhibited cell proliferation after 24 h.
As demonstrated in the Figure 2A, different color peaks
have indicated different generations of daughter cells
distribution, determining up to 7–10 cell cycles of division
in the Renca cells (Amblyomin-X treatment – untreated
control, respectively). The shift in the fluorescence
signal in the Renca-treated parental cells appointed a
reduction in the proliferation index compared to untreated
control (Figure 2B). The effect of Amblyomin-X in the
phases of the cell cycle was also investigated; the anti
proliferative and/or pro-apoptotic drug effects promoted
cell cycle alterations, triggering a reduction in the cell
proliferation rate. In Renca cells, the Amblyomin-X
treatment for 24 h increased the percentage of cells in G0/
G1 phase, and decreased the percentage of cells in S or
G2/M phase compared to the untreated cells (Table 1). In
agreement with previous studies, sub-diploid cells were
observed, indicating apoptosis. In contrast, fibroblasts
(NIH3T3) were preserved, and insignificant alterations
were observed in G1 phase of cell cycle, reinforcing the
selectivity of Amblyomin-X on tumor cells.

Modulation of biomarkers on survival and
proliferation
Consistent with the cell proliferation and cell cycle
findings, the Amblyomin-X treatment has changed the
protein levels involved on survival and proliferation.
In Renca cells the levels of cyclin D1 and Ki67, two

cell proliferation markers, decreased by 50% and 75%,
respectively (Figure 3A and 3B). However, the VEGFR1
expression levels did not change (Figure 3C). The Pgp
levels (an efflux pump protein that confers resistance to
multiple drugs by reducing the intracellular concentration
of cytotoxic agents) decreased by approximately 15%

(Figure 3D). In order to determine whether the effects
of Amblyomin-X are selective on tumor cells, the same
biomarkers were investigated in NIH3T3 (non-tumor)
cells. Of note, only the cyclin D1 and VEGFR1 expression
levels were decreased, around 15% and 40%, respectively,
after the treatment with Amblyomin-X (Figure 3A and 3C).

than 100-fold the effective dose, and after 14 days the organs were collected and processed for (C) histological analyses.

dose was to evaluate the compound’s tumor avidity, not
the therapeutic effect.

In order to determine the Ambly750s avidity for
Renca tumor mass, the orthotopic kidney tumor model
was developed using luciferase-expressing Renca cells
(Renca-luc). At the 11th day, a single dose of Ambly750s
(1 mg/Kg) was intravenously administered, and the in
vivo image assay was carried out (Figure 4A). Clearly,
Ambly750S was localized in the tumor stroma after 30
min of administration, and has remained there for 3 days
(Figure 4B). It is noteworthy that the purpose of the single

Amblyomin-X treatment drastically reduces the incidence
of lung metastases in comparison to the saline treatment

a reduction of the number of metastases (87%) was
observed (Figure 5D), whereas the lungs parenchyma
of the same animals was unaffected by the treatment
(Figure 5E). Histological analysis of the lungs revealed
5% tumor necrosis in the control specimens (Figure 5F)
whereas 30% tumor necrosis was observed in the treated
animals (Figure 5G). The mitotic indexes were extremely
high in both untreated (control) and treated animal tumors.
Metastatic lung Ki67 immunohistochemistry revealed
about 30% of brown-stained positive nuclei in control
animals whereas only 5–7% of cells showed positivity to
Ki-67 in metastatic lungs of treated animals (Figure 5H).
Although no difference between control and treated groups

was observed for Bcl-2 levels measured in metastasisfree liver, in metastasis isolated from the peritoneal
cavity, Bcl-2 protein was down-regulated to 75% in the
Amblyomin-X-treated group. However, in the homogenate
of metastatic lungs, which has a significant portion of
healthy tissue, the reduction for the treated group was
20% only (Figure 5I).

DISCUSSION
Despite the recent advances, the RCC treatment
still remains as a challenge for oncologists. In RCC,
primary tumors are well vascularized, and hematogenous

metastases are found most often in the lungs, bones, and
lymph nodes. The RCC treatment currently includes
surgical management of localized renal cancer [11, 24],
or antiproliferative and anti-angiogenic agents combined
with immunotherapy or radiotherapy to metastatic disease.
However, all these therapeutic alternatives have improved
neither the prolongation of overall survival nor the healthrelated quality of life score (HRQoL) [25]. The most
common adverse events related to the antiproliferative
and anti-angiogenic current treatments are diarrhea,
hypertension, hair color changes, nausea, anorexia,
fatigue, and vomiting [8, 26]. These effects are associated
with low selectivity-treatment, leading to cytotoxicity in
different levels of aggressiveness depending on the drug.
In this study, when Ambly750S (1 mg/kg) was
administered to healthy animals it was rapidly metabolized
and mainly excreted by the kidneys (Figure 1A). In
addition, in the histological analysis no tissues injuries
were found even after an intravenous injection of
Amblyomin-X 100-fold higher than the effective dose.
Furthermore, side effects such as physiologic, alimentary
or behavioral disorders were not observed.
Moreover, in vitro analyses on cell precursor’s
frequency and the cellular proliferation index indicated

that the Amblyomin-X treatment reduced the Renca cells
proliferation rate; this effect was accompanied by a cell
cycle arrest. This cellular response could be related to the
Amblyomin-X-induced proteasome inhibition and ER
stress in Renca cells, previously reported by our group
[18, 27]. The proteasome is important for modulating
the activity of the cyclin-dependent inhibitors p21 and
p27 [28]. Therefore, changes in its activity can lead to
perturbations in the cell cycle. Also, Amblyomin-Xinduced ER stress in Renca cells is accompanied by the
induction of GADD153 expression, which can lead to cell
cycle arrest [29].
Considering the findings, we evaluated the cell
proliferation biomarkers in Renca cells and found that the
Amblyomin-X treatment has decreased the protein levels
of Ki67, which is a cell proliferation marker associated
with a poor prognosis in RCC patients [6]. Interestingly,
recent studies have shown that Ki67 knockdown leads to
cell death in human renal carcinoma [30], highlighting the
importance of drugs that regulate this protein. Moreover,
the Amblyomin-X treatment has also decreased the cyclin
D1 protein levels . Cyclin D1 is involved in the G1 to S
phase transition and can be considered as an indicator for
the proliferative response.

difference in Amblyomin-X cytotoxicity (in vitro and in
vivo) on tumor and non-tumor cells would be associated
with its preferential uptake by cancer cells.
Our findings have demonstrated that the
Amblyomin-X monotherapy can significantly inhibit
metastasis formation comparing untreated and treated
animals. Moreover, the histological analyses have shown
that the Amblyomin-X cytotoxicity was restricted to the
tumor area. In addition, when the Bcl-2 anti-apoptotic
protein-expression was measured in the liver, peritoneal
metastases, and metastatic lungs, we observed a selective
reduction. Therefore this selective reduction is in
accordance with the previous results, that have shown
imbalance between pro and anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family
proteins, including caspase-3 activated, in Renca cells
treated Amblyomin-X, but not in non-tumor cells [18].
The findings also reinforce the selective anti-tumor effect
regarding the in vivo treatment. However, the molecular
mechanism involved in this kind of selectivity needs to
be unveiled, and our research group is working to reach
that goal. Preliminary results have pointed out to specific
membrane interactions that may involve a membrane
phospholipid, phosphatidylserine, which is translocated to
the membrane outer leaflet in cancer cells. Amblyomin-X
seems to be a safer potential drug candidate. Nowadays,
the antineoplastic drugs for treating RCC have shown
high cytotoxicity and tumor resistance, achieving better
antitumor effects when used in combination with other
therapeutic agents. In conclusion, Amblyomin-X exhibits
selective antitumor activity in a renal cancer model.
In renal cancer cells, Amblyomin-X triggers cellular
responses, which act synergistically, and promotes down
regulation of survival pathways that lead to cell death.
Interestingly, Amblyomin-X exhibits a more driven or
selective antitumor action emphasized by the reduced
in vivo toxicity on non-tumor cells or tissues. Taken all
findings together, Amblyomin-X could be considered as a
potential anticancer drug candidate opening frontiers for
future experimentation in anticancer therapy.

Although no changes in the VEGFR1 protein levels
were observed in Renca cells, Drewes and colleagues
have reported the Amblyomin-X anti-angiogenic effects
[23]. In addition, they demonstrated post-transcriptional
alterations in other processes related to angiogenesis,
such as cytokine secretion and adhesion molecules in
endothelial cells (integrins) involved in the Amblyomin-X
mechanism of action as an antitumor agent [22].
In contrast to other drugs under study for treating
RCC [15], Amblyomin-X decreases the Pgp protein levels
in Renca cells. The ability to reverse multidrug resistance
of chemotherapeutics has been widely investigated using
verapamil and cyclosporine A, for instance [31]. However,
the clinical use of Pgp inhibitors can be generally
complicated due to both, the pharmacokinetic interactions
resulting from inhibiting Pgp in normal tissues,
increasing the toxicity associated with chemotherapy,
and the modulation of the pharmacological effects of
the therapeutic agent itself, which often produces severe
toxicity at the levels required to effectively block the Pgp
activity in tumors [32]. In this regard, we have proposed
that Amblyomin-X is able to down regulate the cellular
pathways which promote the Renca cell survival, and
those pathways would be probably related to tumor
maintenance and metastasis induction.
On the other hand, the evaluation of the same
RCC biomarkers in non-tumoral NIH3T3 cells showed
a discrete alteration in the cyclin D1 protein levels.
That change should not be drastic, since the cell cycle
has remained unaltered. The VEGFR1 protein levels
decreased considerably in NIH3T3cells when treated with
Amblyomin-X. However, NIH3T3 cells viability remained
the same under treatment, whatever the biomarkers used
in this study [18], or at the highest dose (data not shown).
Thus, any perturbation caused by Amblyomin-X seems
to be restored in non-tumor cells. Corroborating with
previous findings, Amblyomin-X acts distinctively on
tumor and non-tumor cells [18, 20].
Considering our previous results on the antitumor
activity of Amblyomin-X on primary melanoma tumors
(B16F10) [21] and the equal mechanisms of cell death
related to Melanoma and Renca cells [18, 19, 21], we used
the orthotopic renal cell carcinoma model to focuss the
effect of Amblyomin-X on metastatic RCC. The kidney
tumor model in mice mimics the disease and clinical
process observed in humans, and it has been particularly
suitable for assessing novel therapeutic approaches
[12]. We used Ambly750S and Renca-luc to evaluate
the Amblyomin-X affinity for the tumor (Figure  1).
Notably, Amblyomin-X was detected in tumor stroma
after 30 min, emphasizing its selectivity for tumor cells.
Furthermore, comparing the excretion time between
healthy animals (Figure 1A) and animals bearing RCC
(Figure 4B), Amblyomin-X has remained three times
upward in the tumor and was detected in the liver after
3 days. Thus, we have shown that the remarkable

Animals
The experiments were performed using male
BALB/c mice (approximately 22 g each) bred in the
animal care facility of Butantan Institute (Sao Paulo, SP,
62262

Brazil). All animals had free access to food and water, and
they were subjected to a 12/12 h light/dark cycle. Ethical
rules for animal care as outlined by the International
Animal Welfare Recommendations and in accordance
with the local institutional animal welfare guideline were
followed. Surgical procedures were performed using
anesthesia via intraperitoneal injection of ketaminexylazine (10–2 mg/mL/kg) in combination with dipyrone
administration (72 h pre- and post-operative). All efforts
were taken into account in order to minimize suffering.

plexus. Then, the biodistribution of the labeled compound
was followed at different times, using a CareStream
instrument. An additional procedure was carried out
where healthy BALB/c male mice were treated with
100 mg/Kg Amblyomin-X, which corresponds to more
than one hundred-fold the effective dose used in the
orthotopic kidney tumors model. After 14 days, the
animals were euthanized by cardiac puncture under deep
anesthesia. Then, the organs were collected and processed
to perform histological analyses. Brain, lung, heart, liver,
spleen and kidney tissues had H&E sections systematically
searched for necrosis, inflammation, vascular damage or
abnormal intracellular accumulations.

Amblyomin-X obtention
Recombinant Amblyomin-X was produced using
an E. coli expression system according to the methods
developed at the Biochemistry and Biophysics Laboratory.
The recombinant protein was expressed with no histidine
tail or any other purification tag sequence. The host system
used was an E. coli strain, BL21 DE3, which harbors a
plasmid for the inducible (1 mM IPTG) expression of
Amblyomin-X under the control of the T5 promoter. The
antibiotic ampicillin was used for resistance selection.
Inclusion bodies containing recombinant Amblyomin-X
were harvested from high density cultures grown in a
bioreactor and washed and solubilized under denaturing
conditions. After refolding, soluble Amblyomin-X was
captured and purified by ion exchange chromatography
(Akta Pilot, GE Healthcare, Sweden). The eluted fractions
were pooled and dialyzed by ultrafiltration using a 3 kDa
cutoff (VersaFlux, GE Healthcare, Sweden). The purified
protein was filtered through a sterile 0.22 μm membrane,
and aliquotes were lyophilized and stored at –70°C until
use.
The concentration was determined using a BCA
assay (Thermo Scientific Pierce BCA Protein Assay)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Biochemical
assays (SDS-PAGE, mass spectrometry, circular dichroism
and MTT) were performed in order to confirm the integrity
and activity of the protein, before further experiments.

Cell proliferation assay
Carboxyfluorescein
diacetate
succinimidyl
ester (CFDA-SE) was used to evaluate the Renca cell
proliferation. That compound is a lipophilic dye that reacts
with the amino groups of peptides and proteins in order to
form a stable amide bond. Also, it is equally partitioned
among daughter cells during cell cycle division. According
to the kit’s manufacture, cell division results in sequential
halving of CFDA-SE fluorescence resulting in a cellular
fluorescence histogram in which the peaks represent
parental generations. Renca cells were seeded in six-well
plates (2 × 105 cells/well), washed three times with PBS,
and incubated with CFDA-SE (5 μM) in PBS, in the dark,
at 37°C, in 5% CO2 for 15 min. After this period, the cells
were treated with 0.5 µM Amblyomin-X for 24 h and were
analyzed using a FACSCalibur™ (Becton Dickinson,
USA) flow cytometer. The proliferation index about
parental cells was calculated by using WinMDI Version
2.8 software.

Cell cycle analysis
Regarding the DNA content analysis, Renca
and NIH3T3 cells (1 × 106) were treated with 0.1 µM
Amblyomin-X for 24 h. Subsequently, the cells were
trypsinized, washed with cold PBS, and fixed with 70%
ethanol for approximately 16 h at 4°C. Then, the cells
were washed three times with cold PBS and stained
with propidium iodide (staining solution: 9.5 mL Triton
X-100 0.1%, 0.2 mL RNase A 10 mg/mL, and 0.25 mL
propidium iodide 1 mg/mL). The cells were examined
using a FACSCalibur™ (Becton-Dickinson, USA) flow
cytometer. The percentage of cells in each cell cycle phase
was analyzed using FlowJo software.

Cell lines and culture conditions
Murine renal adenocarcinoma cells (Renca) (No.
CRL-2947, ATCC, Manassas, VA) were cultured in RPMI
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 0.1 mM
nonessential amino acids, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 2 mM
L-glutamine, 100 mg/mL streptomycin sulfate, and 100 U/

from ATCC (n°. CRL-1658, Manassas, VA) were cultured
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. All cell lines
were incubated in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator at 37°C.

Determination of protein levels of RCC
biomarkers

In vivo acute toxicity assay

PBS and permeabilized with 0.5% saponin in FACS buffer
(BD Biosciences). After that, the cells were incubated
for 18 h, at 4°C, with the following mouse monoclonal
antibodies at 1 μg/106 cells concentration: anti-VEGFR1 or
anti-Cyclin D1 (both from Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and
anti-Ki67 MIB or anti-Pgp (both from BD Biosciences).
After being washed with PBS, the cells were incubated
with FITC-conjugated anti–mouse antibody. The cells
were subjected to FACSCalibur™ (Becton Dickinson,
USA) flow cytometry, and the data were analyzed with
FlowJo software.

acquired by FACSCalibur™ (Becton Dickinson, USA)
flow cytometry. The data were analyzed with FlowJo
software.

In vivo imaging of RCC tumors (model for tumor
affinity)
Renca cells were stably transfected as described
elsewhere [32]. Then, luciferase stably transfected Rencaluc cells (1 × 106 cells) were orthotopically injected into the
subcapsular space of the left kidney of BALB/c mice under
anesthesia. For detection, Amblyomin-X was directly
labeled with the amine-reactive dye using the Vivotag750S
(Perkin Elmer®), following manufacturer instruction. The
conjugated dye-protein was named Ambly750S.
At 11st day of tumor implant, the animals were
anesthetized with isoflurane and intraperitoneally injected
using 150 mg/kg D-luciferin (PerkinElmer, Ohio, USA).
Simultaneously, a single Ambly750S dose (1 mg/Kg) was
intravenously administered into the orbital plexus. Ten
minutes after the D-luciferin injection, mice were imaged
for 1 -5 minutes. In vivo images of X-ray, luminescence
(Renca-Luc), and fluorescence (Ambly750S - Ex:750
nm and Em: 790 nm), were acquired using CareStream
instrument (MS FX PRO, DT, USA).

Orthotopic kidney tumors model
The orthotopic tumor model was established by
injecting 1×106 Renca cells into the subcapsular space of
the left kidney of BALB/c mice under anesthesia. At the
10th day, when the primary tumor had already developed,
the animals were subjected to total nephrectomy. After
24 h, the animals were randomly split into 2 groups, each
one composed by 8 animals, which received daily (during
14 days) an intraperitoneal injection of either 200 µL
sterile saline or Amblyomin-X (1 mg/kg sterile saline).
Then, the animals were euthanized by cardiac puncture
under deep anesthesia, and the lungs were collected,
weighed, and observed, in order to compare the number
of metastases. Histological analyses were performed (i)
to provide a quantitative analysis of lung metastasis; and,
(ii) to inspect tumor and non-tumor lung parenchyma.
Standard light microscopy immunohistochemistry
analysis was conducted in five non-selected different
tumor areas in order to evaluate cell proliferation, using
an antibody against KI-67 (MIB-1, BD Biosciences)
and counting at least 1000 nuclei. Light stained nuclei
were also considered as positive result. All steps of this
procedure were repeated three times, and can be found in
Supplementary Figure S1.

Statistical analysis
Results were expressed as arithmetic means ± SEM.
Statistical analysis was performed using the statistical
analysis option in the GraphPad Prism 5.0 software
(GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA), unpaired
t-tests with Welch’s correction to compare the differences
between Amblyomin-X treatment and untreated control.
P < 0.05 was regarded as significantly different.

Determination of Bcl-2 protein in orthotopic
kidney tumors model by flow cytometry

We thank KFM Pasqualoto, MP Alvares-Flores, and
A Iqbal, for critically reading the manuscript.

Flow cytometry was applied to evaluate the
expression of an anti-apoptotic protein, Bcl-2 (Santa Cruz,
USA) in the liver, peritoneal metastases, and metastatic
lungs tissues, isolated from an orthotopic kidney tumor
model, as previously mentioned. A combined mechanical
and enzymatic approach for tissue disaggregation was
applied. Briefly, the tissues were mechanically disrupted
and submitted to an enzymatic digestion through
colagenase type IV (Sigma) (2 mg/ml) incubation for
40 min at 37ºC, under agitation, and neutralized with PBSFBS 2.5%. The homogenate was filtered in the cell strainer
70 μm (Corning) and submitted to 1× RBC lysis buffer.
Cells were adjusted to 1 × 106 cells/mL and the labeling
was performed according to manufacturer instructions,
