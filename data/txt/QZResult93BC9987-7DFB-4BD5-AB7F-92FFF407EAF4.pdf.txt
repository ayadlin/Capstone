ABSTRACT
Reliance on glycolysis is a characteristic of malignancy, yet the development of
resistance to BRAF inhibitors in melanoma is associated with gain of mitochondrial
function. Concurrent attenuation of oxidative phosphorylation and HIF-1α/PKM2dependent glycolysis promotes a non-apoptotic, iron- and oxygen-dependent cell
death that we term ferroxitosis. The redox cycling agent menadione causes a robust
increase in oxygen consumption, accompanied by significant loss of intracellular
ATP and rapid cell death. Conversely, either hypoxic adaptation or iron chelation
prevents menadione-induced ferroxitosis. Ectopic expression of K213Q HIF-1α mutant
blunts the effects of menadione. However, knockdown of HIF-1α or PKM2 restores
menadione-induced cytotoxicity in hypoxia. Similarly, exposure of melanoma cells to
shikonin, a menadione analog and a potential PKM2 inhibitor, is sufficient to induce
ferroxitosis under hypoxic conditions. Collectively, our findings reveal that ferroxitosis
curtails metabolic plasticity in melanoma.

INTRODUCTION

functions of mitochondria by diminishing the supply
of acetyl-coA and NADH [5]. Although HIF-1α is a
critical transcription factor that regulates glycolysis and
oxidative phosphorylation to promote cell survival, a cell
death mechanism that inactivates this transcription factor
remains unknown.
Pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2), an embryonic isoform
predominantly expressed in malignant cells catalyzes the
conversion of phosphoenolpyruvate to pyruvate. PKM2
is a key determinant of aerobic glycolysis, also known
as the Warburg effect, which is commonly observed in
tumor cells [6]. Although initially it was thought that
PKM2 is a cytoplasmic glycolytic enzyme, subsequent
studies uncovered its non-canonical nuclear functions [79]. ERK1/2-phosphorylated PKM2 translocates into the
nucleus and promotes c-myc transcription in mediating

Malignant cells exploit the normal adaptive
mechanisms to survive and proliferate in limited oxygen
environment found within the tumor parenchyma.
Hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) is a key
transcription factor that facilitates adaptation to hypoxic
conditions [1]. The levels of HIF-1α protein are tightly
controlled by the availability of oxygen and iron, which
activate prolylhydroxylases-mediated hydroxylation
of HIF-1α and subsequent proteasomal degradation
[2]. Hypoxic conditions or limited availability of iron
enable stabilization of HIF-1α protein and consecutive
transcriptional activation of genes responsible for
glucose uptake and glycolysis [3, 4]. While increasing
the glycolytic capacity of cells, HIF-1α also limits the

the Warburg effect and tumorigenesis [10]. These
findings underscore the critical role for both nuclear and
cytoplasmic functions of PKM2 in tumor progression.
Melanomas invariably harbor mutations that
constitutively activate the RAF-MEK-ERK pathway,
leading to aggressive progression of the disease [11-13].
Disruption of the RAF-MEK-ERK signaling with BRAF
or MEK inhibitors has shown significant clinical responses
in the treatment of melanoma, yet the rapid development
of resistance to these inhibitors presents a formidable
challenge [14]. Although aerobic glycolysis supports
tumor cell proliferation, increased mitochondrial mass and
capacity enables melanoma cells to overcome the RAFMEK-ERK pathway blockade strategy [15-18]. Therefore,
targeting metabolic reprogramming may provide effective
clinical strategy. Here we report a novel iron- and oxygendependent mechanism of cell death that is coupled to
oxidative phosphorylation and HIF-1α/PKM2-dependent

glycolysis in melanoma.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Menadione, a vitamin K metabolite [19], is
detectable in human and rodent tissues, although the
physiological role remains unclear. We undertook a
study to evaluate the cytotoxic effects of menadione on
human melanoma cells harboring mutations in BRAF
(MEL526), NRAS (MEL103) and wild-type BRAF/NRAS
(SKMEL23), or normal human fetal lung (IMR90) and
skin (BJ) fibroblasts. Menadione significantly reduced the
viability of melanoma cells in a concentration-dependent
manner with an EC50 of 20μM, whereas the viability of
normal cells was unchanged (Figure 1A). Subsequently,
several melanoma cell lines exposed to 20μM menadione
showed a dramatic reduction in viability regardless of the
RAF-MEK-ERK pathway mutations (Figure 1B). Results

from dye-exclusion assays revealed that menadione,
but not other pro-oxidants, promoted a robust cell death
(Figure 1C,D). The in vivo relevance of these observations
was ascertained in MEL526 cells xenografted to NSG
mice where menadione significantly reduced tumor growth
(Figure 1E). To test the possibility of p53 activation and
involvement of autophagy, melanoma cells were treated
with etoposide, H2O2, or menadione, and the cell extracts
were examined by immunoblot. Menadione neither
activated the p53 pathway nor induced autophagy (Figure
S1). Caspase activity was unchanged by menadione, and
pre-treatment with the pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VADFMK did not prevent its cytotoxic effects (Figure S1).
Consistent with these data, menadione did not alter the
mitochondrial membrane potential (Movie S1). Inhibition
of necroptosis with nectrostatin-1 also did not reduce
menadione-mediated cell death, in accordance with
fluorescent assays of cell membrane integrity (Figure S1).
These results suggest that menadione causes a form of cell
death distinct from apoptosis, autophagy and necrosis.
To determine whether menadione-mediated cell

death is linked to energetic catastrophe we used an
ATP-coupled luminescence assay. Menadione exposure
caused a dose-dependent depletion of ATP, with a nadir
at 40μM (Figure 2A). These results were substantiated
by HPLC-based biochemical analysis of total nucleotide
from menadione-treated samples, which confirmed a
dramatic reduction in ATP and GTP, with no change in
the levels of other nucleotides (Figure 2B). Measurements
of oxygen consumption rate (OCR) demonstrated that
menadione caused a robust increase in OCR, far exceeding
that of the uncoupling agent 2,4-dinitrophenol (Figure
2C). Furthermore, dihydroethidium (DHE) fluorescence
assay verified menadione-induced production of
superoxide (Figure 2D). Consistent with this observation,
pretreatment of cells with anti-oxidants prevented the
effects of menadione (Figure S2). These results suggest
that menadione uncouples oxidative phosphorylation in
promoting rapid cell death.
Considering the critical role of mitochondria in
regulation of intracellular iron, we hypothesized that
menadione-induced cell death may involve iron. Perls’

DAB stain [20] of menadione-treated cells indicated
release of free iron (Figure S3). To test if iron chelation
would block menadione-mediated cytotoxicity, cells
were treated with menadione in the presence or absence
of structurally unrelated iron chelators deferoxamine and
ciclopirox olamine, and cell viability was determined.
Iron chelation protected the cells from menadione
(Figure 3A), an effect corroborated in dye-exclusion
assays (Figure 3B). In addition, deferoxamine partially
rescued menadione-induced loss of ATP (Figure 3C) and
significantly blunted menadione-mediated increase in
OCR (Figure 3D). Although menadione was cytotoxic
to lung (H1299) and cervical cancer (C33a) cell lines,
deferoxamine did not confer protection, suggesting that

iron chelation is not sufficient to overcome the effects of
menadione in these non-melanoma cell lines. Moreover,
these results support the interpretation that the effects
observed in melanoma cells are biological and not due to
drug interactions (Figure S4). To test the involvement of
known iron regulators, melanoma cells were depleted of
ACO1, ACO2, ACO3, FTMT, FXN and MFI2, and cell
viability in presence of menadione was determined (Figure
S5). Depletion of these iron regulators did not significantly
change the outcome of menadione-induced cytotoxicity.
We propose that the mechanism of ferroxitosis is distinct
from that of ferroptosis [21], as the latter does not produce
mitochondrial ROS and there is no change in the levels
of ATP. Collectively, these results suggest that menadione

targets mitochondria to cause an iron- and oxygen-driven
cytotoxic process that we term ferroxitosis.
Iron chelators are commonly used as hypoxia
mimetics [3]. This led to the consideration that hypoxia
may block menadione-induced ferroxitosis. Menadione
decreased cell viability in normoxia, yet this effect was
completely blocked by hypoxia (1% O2), suggesting that
reliance on maximal mitochondrial respiration is essential
for menadione-induced cell death (Figure 3E). These
results are consistent with the reported observations that
the hypoxic transcription program limits acetyl-CoA
availability for the TCA cycle and reduces the efficiency
of electron transfer, thereby collectively minimizing
mitochondrial function in hypoxic conditions [5, 22, 23].
To test whether hypoxia transcription factor HIF-1α is
responsible for this protective effect, MEL526 cells were
transduced with lentivirus encoding control, HIF-1α, or
HIF-1α transcriptional subunit ARNT2 shRNAs, and
exposed to menadione. Depletion of either HIF-1α or
ARNT2 restored menadione sensitivity in hypoxia (Figure
3F). These observations are in agreement with studies
showing that HIF-1α-null mouse embryonic fibroblasts
show elevated oxygen consumption and ATP production
in hypoxia, revealing a reverse metabolic switch from
glycolysis to oxidative phosphorylation [22, 24]. We
conclude that activation of HIF-1α protects cells from
menadione-induced ferroxitosis by minimizing oxidative
phosphorylation, while attenuation of the HIF-1α pathway
forces cells to use mitochondria for energy production,
thereby restoring sensitivity to menadione.
Mining of the publicly available COSMIC cancer

genome catalog (http://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic/
mutation/overview?id=1559432), which includes the
data set from The Cancer Genome Atlas revealed a
novel recurrent mutation, K213Q, in the dimerization
domain of HIF-1α in human glioma samples (Table S1).
While the HIF-1α oxygen sensing domain, where prolyl
hydroxylases target P402 and P564 to promote degradation
[25, 26], is relatively well-studied, the dimerization
domain that harbors K213Q is not. We questioned
whether the K213Q amino acid substitution may have an
evolutionary significance. While lysine 213 of the HIF1α protein is highly conserved from humans to zebrafish,
Antarctic deep-water fish Pachycara brachycephalum
harbors glutamine instead of lysine at 213 (Figure 4A).
Metabolic adaptation enables this fish to dwell in an
oxygen-limited environmental niche [27]. Although
publicly available dataset has not revealed the presence
of K213Q mutation in melanoma samples, studies
suggest that HIF-1α-dependent glycolytic program offers
metabolic plasticity and growth advantage for melanoma
cells [28-33]. To test the effects of K213Q on the stability
of the HIF-1α protein, MEL526 cells were lentivirally
transduced to express wild type HIF-1α, the degradationresistant P402A/P564A (HIF-1PA), K213Q (HIF-1Q),
and the combined K213Q/P402A/P564A (HIF-1QPA).
Immunoblot analysis showed an increase in the stability
of the HIF-1PA and HIF-1QPA mutants (Figure 4B). To
assess the biological effects of K213Q, melanoma cells
stably expressing wild-type HIF-1α, HIF-1Q, HIF-1PA,
or HIF-1QPA were exposed to menadione. Among these
stable cells, an increased protection against menadione

by HIF-1Q-expressing cells and a complete prevention of
menadione-induced ferroxitosis by HIF-1QPA-expressing
cells were recorded (Figure 4C). Therefore, we asked if
HIF-1QPA would suppress the enhanced rate of oxygen
consumption by menadione. We found that melanoma
cells expressing HIF-1QPA reduced menadione-mediated
increase in OCR by 50% compared to cells expressing wtHIF-1α (Figure 4D). These results lead us to propose that
K213Q of HIF-1α found in tumor cells or organisms living

in limited oxygen enable them to reduce mitochondrial
respiration in adaptation to hypoxic conditions.
To further characterize the mechanism of
ferroxitosis, we screened analogs of menadione with
the aim of identifying a compound possessing the antimitochondrial activity of menadione while blunting the
protective effects of iron chelation (Figure S6). One such
compound, shikonin consistently reduced cell viability
even in the presence of iron chelator. Shikonin has been

described as a selective inhibitor of PKM2 activity and
treatment of mice with shikonin reduced PKM2-dependent
lactate production [34, 35]. Based on the reported
observations that nuclear function of PKM2 requires ERK
activity [10] and that the RAF-MEK-ERK pathway is
hyperactive in melanoma [11-13], we hypothesized that
BRAF and MEK inhibitors may sensitize melanoma cells
to menadione in hypoxic conditions. Cell viability assays
from several combinations of these drugs in normoxia
and hypoxia revealed that MEK inhibitor (trametinib)
or BRAF inhibitor (vemurafenib) by themselves were
not cytotoxic (Figure 5A). However, when combined
with these inhibitors, menadione significantly decreased
cell viability in hypoxia. BRAF inhibitor was selective
in sensitizing mutant BRAF (MEL526) but not mutant
NRAS (MEL103) melanoma cells to menadione. Because
menadione-mediated ferroxitosis requires maximal
mitochondrial respiration, it is likely that trametinib and
vemurafenib inhibit ERK activity and disable the nuclear
function of PKM2 in sensitizing cells to menadione. In
agreement with these observations, menadione analog
shikonin, a known inhibitor of PKM2 [34, 35], was
sufficient to dramatically reduce the viability of cells in
hypoxia. If a compromise in PKM2 function is essential
for sensitizing cells to menadione, we reasoned that PKM2
depletion should sensitize melanoma cells to menadione
in hypoxia. Recapitulating the effects of shikonin, PKM2
knockdown restored the cytotoxic effects of menadione in
hypoxia (Figure 5B). These results suggest that depletion
of PKM2 in hypoxia forces cells to utilize mitochondria
for energy production, thus rendering these cells
vulnerable to menadione-induced ferroxitosis. Consistent
with these premises, oxygen consumption measurements
revealed that unlike menadione, shikonin-induced increase
in OCR was unaffected by iron chelation (Figure 5C).
Furthermore, we found that exposure of melanoma cells
to shikonin reduced the levels of lactate under hypoxic
conditions (Figure S7).
Since shikonin is a bifunctional compound that
inhibits PKM2 and also targets mitochondria, we
asked whether ferroxitosis induced by shikonin would
destabilize HIF-1α. Immunoblot assays of melanoma
cells showed shikonin, but not menadione destabilize
HIF-1α in hypoxia (Figure 5D). To test whether shikoninmediated HIF-1α destabilization is due to available iron
and enhanced oxygen consumption associated oxidative
stress, MEL103 cells were treated with iron chelator,
N-acetyl cysteine (NAC), or a combination of these
agents, and the effects of shikonin on HIF-1α stability in
hypoxia was assessed. Although iron chelation or NAC
was not sufficient to completely negate the effects of
shikonin, NAC combined with deferoxamine reversed
HIF-1α destabilization (Figure 5E).
It has been recognized that mitochondria play a key
role in the pathophysiology of various diseases including
cancer [36, 37]. For example, gain of mitochondrial
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

mass and capacity are thought to contribute to melanoma
developing resistance to treatment with BRAF inhibitors
[15-18]. These reports led to the suggestion that targeting
oxidative phosphorylation with antidiabetic biguanide may
delay resistance development to BRAF inhibitors [15].
Although high concentrations of biguanide phenformin
seem to augment the effects of BRAF inhibitor [38],
clinical benefits of these findings are not yet known.
Our results demonstrate that menadione specifically
targets oxidative phosphorylation, which could in turn
improve the therapeutic efficacy of BRAF and/or MEK
inhibitors. Recognizing the complexity of both nuclear
and cytoplasmic functions of PKM2, we propose that
targeting PKM2-dependent glycolysis and oxidative
phosphorylation could be a novel therapeutic approach
for neuroectodermal tumors. Considering that highly
proliferative tumor cells rely heavily on PKM2 for the
anabolic and energy requirements, specific targeting of
PKM2 may have less impact on normal cells. Collectively,
our findings establish that activation of ferroxitosis in
the context of PKM2 inhibition will not only inactivate
oxidative phosphorylation (Figure 5F), but it will also
serve as feed-forward loop to destabilize HIF-1α and
presents a novel strategy to combat melanoma.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture
Cell lines were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified
atmosphere at 5% CO2 and grown in RPMI 1640 or
DMEM growth media (Invitrogen) supplemented with
10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma), 50 units ml−1 penicillin
and 50 µg ml−1 streptomycin (Invitrogen). The following
cell lines were maintained in RPMI 1640: SK23, MEL501,
MEL526, MEL624. The following cell lines were
maintained in DMEM: BJ, IMR90, MEL103, MEL187,
RPMI 8322, VMM39, WM2664. Hypoxic conditions (1%
O2) were achieved in a Ruskinn in-vivo2 400 hypoxia
chamber, by supplementing ambient air with balanced N2
and CO2.

Animal studies
NSG (NOD/scid/IL2Rgnull) mice were bred at IU
Simon Cancer Center In-Vivo Therapeutic Core facility.
8 week old male animals were subcutaneously implanted
with 1 million of MEL526 cells in 100μl serum free media
into the right hind flank. Tumors were allowed to develop
for 21 days after which the mice were randomized into
the control and treatment groups (n=4). Treatments of
vehicle (DMSO) or MEN (15mg/kg body weight) were
administered via intraperitoneal injection three times
a week [39]. Xenograft size was measured three times

of

viability

Following treatment, medium was aspirated and the
cells washed three times with ice-cold PBS. Extraction
was done by scraping the cells in 180 µl ice-cold
acetonitrile followed by 420 µl cold water. The soluble
and precipitated fractions were centrifuged at 16000 g
for 10 min at –20o C. The supernatant fraction, kept on
ice, was then gassed with N2 for 30 min to evaporate
acetonitrile. The pellet was solubilized with 1 N NaOH
and the protein content analyzed with Coomassie Blue
assay (Pierce Chemical, Rockford, IL). The column used
was a 4 µm Nova-Pack C18 cartridge (100 mm by 8 mm
ID), equipped with a radial compression chamber (Waters,
Millford, MA). The buffer consisted of 20% acetonitrile,
10 mM ammonium phosphate and 2 mM PIC-A ion
pairing reagent (Waters) and was run isocratically at
2 ml/min (10). Samples were diluted in half and the
injection volume was 100 µl. A HP Chemstation model
1100 was used (Hewlett-Packard, Wilmington, DE), and
the UV detector set at 254 nm. HPLC grade nucleotide
standards were used to calibrate the signals. They were
run daily because the retention of the column varied with
time. Internal standards were added to the samples to test
recovery. It exceeded 90% for all nucleotides.

and ATP

Cells were seeded at density of 1 x 104 cells per well
of a 96 well plate (Corning) in technical triplicates per
condition. Viability was assayed using resazurin reagent
(Biotium) in accordance with manufacturer’s protocol.
ATP and caspase activity were measured using CellTiterGlo reagent (Promega). Fluorescent and luminescent
signals were read on Synergy H1 microplate reader
(BioTek Instruments).

Cellular Respirometry
Oxygen consumption rate (OCR) of cultured cells
was measured with an XF24 extracellular flux analyzer
(Seahorse Bioscience). Cells were seeded at 4 x 104
cells per well one day before the experiment and all
experiments were performed at 37°C in a bath solution
consisting of RPMI:DMEM (1:2) supplemented with 3%
FBS. Following three baseline OCR measurements, wells
were sequentially injected with oligomycin, menadione
or vehicle, 2,4-dinitrophenol, and rotenone + antimycin
A. Once injected, each compound was present in the bath
medium for the duration of the experiment. Three OCR
measurements were performed after each injection. To
ensure that the culture maintained sufficient oxygenation,
a 3-minute mix, 2-minute wait cycle occurred prior to each
3-minute measurement.

siRNA knockdown
Gene knockdown was done using PepMute
(SignaGen) with custom-made dsiRNA (IDT) based
on published sequences. Briefly, cells were seeded into
6-well plates at a density of 3 x 10^5 cells per well. siRNA
complexes were prepared at 20 nM siRNA in according to
the manufacturer’s instructions.
