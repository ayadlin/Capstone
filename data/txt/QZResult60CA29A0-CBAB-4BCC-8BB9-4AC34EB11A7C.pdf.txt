Abstract
Signals emanating from the bone marrow microenvironment, such as stromal cells, are thought to support the
survival and proliferation of the malignant cells in patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN). To
examine this hypothesis, we established a coculture platform [cells cocultured directly (cell-on-cell) or indirectly
(separated by micropore membrane)] designed to interrogate the interplay between Janus activated kinase 2V617F (JAK2V617F)â€“positive cells and the stromal cells. Treatment with atiprimod, a potent JAK2 inhibitor,
caused marked growth inhibition and apoptosis of human (SET-2) and mouse (FDCP-EpoR) JAK2V617F-positive
cells as well as primary blood or bone marrow mononuclear cells from patients with polycythemia vera; however,
these effects were attenuated when any of these cell types were cocultured (cell-on-cell) with human marrow
stromal cell lines (e.g., HS5, NK.tert, TM-R1). Coculture with stromal cells hampered the ability of atiprimod to
inhibit phosphorylation of JAK2 and the downstream STAT3 and STAT5 pathways. This protective effect was
maintained in noncontact coculture assays (JAK2V617F-positive cells separated by 0.4-mm-thick micropore
membranes from stromal cells), indicating a paracrine effect. Cytokine profiling of supernatants from noncontact coculture assays detected distinctly high levels of interleukin 6 (IL-6), fibroblast growth factor (FGF), and
chemokine C-X-C-motif ligand 10 (CXCL-10)/IFN-gâ€“inducible 10-kD protein (IP-10). Anti-IL-6, -FGF, or -CXCL10/IP-10 neutralizing antibodies ablated the protective effect of stromal cells and restored atiprimod-induced
apoptosis of JAK2V617F-positive cells. Therefore, our results indicate that humoral factors secreted by stromal
cells protect MPN clones from JAK2 inhibitor therapy, thus underscoring the importance of targeting the
marrow niche in MPN for therapeutic purposes. Cancer Res; 71(11); 3831â€“40. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
The myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN)â€”polycythemia
vera (PV), essential thrombocythemia (ET), and primary myelofibrosis (PMF)â€”originate from the clonal transformation of
hematopoietic stem cells (HSC)/hematopoietic progenitors
(HP), which gives rise to abnormal proliferation of one or
several hematopoietic lineages driven by hypersensitivity to
regulatory growth factors (1). Deregulation of kinase activity
has emerged as a major mechanism by which cancer cells
evade normal physiologic constraints on growth and survival.
In MPNs, the gain-of-function Janus activated kinase 2-V617F
(JAK2V617F) mutation is present in almost all patients with PV

and in approximately 50% of patients with ET or PMF (1â€“5).
JAK2V617F activates several signaling pathways crucial for
cellular survival and proliferation. The putative role of
JAK2V617F in the pathogenesis of MPNs provided the rationale
for the development of JAK2 inhibitors for the treatment of
patients with MPNs. Clinical trials testing the activity of
several JAK2 inhibitors are ongoing, particularly in myelofibrosis (6, 7). Although preliminary results show significant
clinical benefit of therapy, these agents have shown no activity
in correcting the fibrosis, osteosclerosis, and neoangiogenesis
that characterize the bone marrow of patients with myelofibrosis, and, furthermore, there has been no elimination of
malignant clone, as evaluated by the continuous presence of
JAK2V617F-positive cells in patients on therapy.
Several lines of evidence suggest that, in myelofibrosis,
stromal cells are primed by the malignant hematopoietic
clone, which, in turn, conditions the stroma to create a
"favorable" pathologic microenvironment that nurtures and
protects the malignant cells. In myelofibrosis, both cellular
and extracellular levels of various fibrogenic and angiogenic
cytokines are increased, thus supporting the notion that the
bone marrow histologic changes that characterize myelofibrosis are reactive and mediated by cytokines such as TGFb,
platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), basic fibroblast growth
factor (bFGF), and VEGF (8). The net result is a tumor niche

that provides environmental cues contributing to the proliferation, maintenance, and (potentially) resistance to therapy
of the malignant clone. Indeed, marrow stromal cells have
been shown to protect chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)
cells from spontaneous or drug-induced apoptosis in vitro and
to confer resistance to therapy in CLL and other B-cell
malignancies, such as acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL;
refs. 9â€“11). Understanding the mechanisms of information
exchange between the malignant clone and the bone marrow
milieu may illuminate methods to eliminate malignant MPN
cells that reside in a protective stromal niche within the
marrow. In this article, we present evidence supporting a
protective effect of the stromal bone marrow niche against
JAK2 inhibitor therapy via stromal cellâ€“secreted humoral
factors. The manipulation of these contextual cues might
be potentially exploited in therapeutic applications for the
eradication of JAK2V617F-positive clones.

recombinant human anti-IL8 (208-IL010), -FGF (hFGF; 233FA-025), and -VEGF (hVEGF; 4644-VS/CF) from R&D Systems.
The JAK2 inhibitor atiprimod (Callisto Pharmaceutical) was
dissolved in PBS (Gibco BRL) to a final concentration of 8
mmol/L. The stock solution was stored at 4 C and further
diluted in tissue-cultured medium just before use.

Materials and Methods

Growth-inhibition MTT assay
MTT assays were conducted as previously described (13,
14). Results shown represent the average SD of 3 independent
experiments, each done in sextuplets.

Cells, monoclonal antibodies, and chemicals
Murine FDCP (factor-dependent cell Patersen) cells transfected with the erythropoietin receptor harboring the human
JAK2V617F mutant allele (henceforth, referred to as FDCPEpoRV617F cells), a kind gift from Dr. Joseph Prchal (University
of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT), were cultured at 37 C in a
humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere by using RPMI-1640 medium
supplemented with 10% FBS and 5% WEHI conditioned
media. Cells from the human SET-2 leukemia cell line with
JAK2V617F mutation were purchased from the DSMZ (Deutsche
Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen Braunschweig) and maintained in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented
with 20% FBS. Cells from the stromal NK.tert cell line [derived
from human bone marrow cells immortalized with human
telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT)] containing exogene MFG-tsT-IRES-neo was obtained from the RIKEN Cell
Bank (Sapporo Medical University, Japan; ref. 12) and cultured
in alpha-minimum essential medium Eagle (a-MEM; Invitrogen) with Earl salts and L-glutamine supplemented with 12.5%
FBS (HyClone), 12.5% human serum (Cellgro), 1 mmol/L
hydrocortisone (Sigma-Aldrich), and 100 mmol/L 2-mercaptoethanol (Sigma-Aldrich). Human stromal cells HS5 [CRL11882; from the American Type Cell Culture (ATCC)] were
maintained in a-MEM medium containing 10% FBS. The
primary stromal cell line TM-R1 (Taghi Manshouri-Rob1)
was established in our laboratory by culturing bone marrow
mononuclear cells from a patient with PMF in a-MEM medium containing 20% FBS. Bone marrow aspirate samples and
peripheral blood samples from patients with PV (none of
whom were receiving PV-directed therapy) were derived
according to an Institutional Review Board (IRB)-approved
laboratory protocol, utilizing leftover material obtained from
specimens used for clinical purposes: mononuclear cells were
isolated as previously published and used in experiments
without further isolation of specific cell types (13, 14).
The monoclonal antibodies used include mouse anti-phosopho-STAT3 (05-485) and -STAT5 (06-553); mouse anti-phosphotyrosine clone-4G10 (05321); rabbit anti-JAK2 (06-255);

Coculture assays
Stromal cell suspensions were prepared at a concentration
of 4  105 cells/mL, and then seeded on 6-well culture plates
(3046; Falcon) at a volume of 2 mL/well, or on 96-well assay
black plates (3603; Corning INC) at a volume of 50 mL/well.
After overnight incubation, the nonadherent cell fraction was
removed and adherent stromal confluent monolayers were
washed 3 times with PBS. FDCP-EpoRV617F or SET-2 cells were
then added to the prepared adherent stroma (8  105 cells
mL/well into 6-well plates; 1  104 cells/50 mL/well into 96well plates) either directly (cell-on-cell) or indirectly (separated by 0.4-mm-thick micropore membranes; Falcon; 353493). Atiprimod was added at different concentrations as
indicated. FDCP-EpoRV617F or SET-2 were then assayed for cell
proliferation in 96-well plates after 72 hours of incubation, as
described above (MTT assay). Alternatively, cell aliquots from
6-well plates were collected after 4, 24, and 48 hours of
incubation to check for apoptosis or were washed 3 times
with cold PBS and frozen at 80 C before Western blot
analysis. The same method was carried out using primary
bone marrow mononuclear cells, instead of FDCP-EpoRV617F
or SET-2 cells, from PV patients.
In additional experiments, supernatants were collected
from aforementioned coculture assays, plated in new plates,
and fresh FDCP-EpoRV617F cells were added with 1 mmol/L
atiprimod for 48 hours; induction of apoptosis was then
assessed by flow cytometry.
Apoptosis assays
Apoptosis of FDCP-EpoRV617F and SET-2 cells, obtained
from coculture assays, was detected by flow cytometry by
using recombinant human Annexin-Vâ€“conjugated with Allophycocyamin (APC; CALTAG; used for FDCP cells) or with
fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC; 51-6710AK; Becton Dickinson Pharmingen; used for SET-2 cells). Analysis was done on a

FACSort flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson Systems) and
results were analyzed using FlowJo Software version 7.2.5
(Ashland).
JAK2 immunoprecipitation and Western blotting
JAK2 immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis were
carried out as previously described (15, 16). Quantitative
densitometry has been used to determine fold change in
protein content in Western blots.
Cytokine multiplexed Bio-Plex assay
FDCP-EpoRV617F and SET-2 cells were washed 3 times with
PBS at room temperature and resuspended in serum-free
medium (StemCell Technology); 2  105 cells/mL were dispensed on 6-well plates that were coated or uncoated with
stroma (separated by micropore membranes), with or without
1 mmol/L atiprimod, and cocultured for 4, 24, and 48 hours.
Supernatants were collected for cytokine measurements. BioPlex human cytokine 27-plex panel assay (171-A11127; BioRad) was used for simultaneous quantitation of 27 cytokines,
according to the manufacturer's instructions. After washing,
beads were resuspended in 125 mL of Bio-Plex Assay Buffer
and analyzed on the Bio-Plex system using Bio-Plex Manager
software with 5PL curve fitting. The reader was set to read a
minimum of 100 beads; results were expressed as median
fluorescent intensity (MFI). After centering each treated sample on the corresponding control sample from the same time
point, the treated and control groups were compared using
2-sided paired t-test.

atiprimod induced only a moderate reduction in the JAK2V617F
allele burden of the proliferating BFUE colonies. Because
colonies were grown in the presence of growth factors and
accessory bone marrow cells were present in all cultures, we
hypothesized that these factors, either alone or in combination, prevented complete growth inhibition of primary
JAK2V617F colony-forming cells. To explore this possibility,
we designed subsequent experiments.
The effect of atiprimod on the viability of FDCP-EpoR cells,
transduced with either mutant (JAK2V617F) or wild-type
(JAK2WT) human JAK2, and on the JAK2V617F-positive SET-2
cell line was investigated using the MTT assay. Exposure to
increasing concentrations of atiprimod for 72 hours resulted
in a dose-dependent inhibition of proliferation (IC50 of 397
nmol/L for FDCP-EpoRV617F, 544 nmol/L for SET-2, and 810
nmol/L for FDCP-EpoRWT cells; fig. Fig. 1A). To test the effect
of stroma presence in the culture on the activity of JAK2
inhibitor, we cocultured FDCP-EpoRV617F and SET-2 cells with
the human stromal cell lines HS5 or NK.tert, with or without
atiprimod, which had no effect on the proliferation of either
stromal cell line (data not shown). The activity of atiprimod on
the proliferation of FDCP-EpoRV617F or SET-2 cells was significantly reduced in the presence of either HS5 or NK.tert
stromal cells (Fig. 1A). The same protective effect was seen
when primary JAK2V617F-positive mononuclear blood cells
from PV patients were exposed to atiprimod in a coculture
with stromal cells: they continued proliferating over time even
in the presence of 1 mmol/L atiprimod (Fig. 1B).

Results

Stroma protects JAK2V617F-positive cells from
atiprimod-induced apoptosis
To understand the "protective effect" of the stroma on the
JAK2V617F-positive cells, we first determined whether atiprimod-mediated growth inhibition of JAK2V617F-positive cells
was due to drug-induced apoptosis and whether stroma could
prevent it. Treatment of FDCP-EpoRV617F cells with 1 mmol/L
atiprimod resulted in significant apoptosis; however, almost
no atiprimod-induced apoptosis of FDCP-EpoRV617F cells was
observed in the presence of HS5 stromal cells (Fig. 2A). The
experiment was then expanded to include both FDCPEpoRV617F and SET-2 cells treated with atiprimod in cocultures with 3 different stromal cell linesâ€”HS5, NK.tert, or TMR1 (Fig. 2B). Coculture of each JAK2V617F-positive cell line on
any monolayer of different stromal cells almost completely
abrogated the proapoptotic activity of atiprimod on
JAK2V617F-positive cells.

Stroma attenuated the antiproliferative effect of JAK2
inhibitor therapy on JAK2V617F-positive cells
We have recently reported that atiprimod is a potent
inhibitor of JAK2 tyrosine kinase (13). Atiprimod inhibited
the growth and caused apoptosis of JAK2V617F-positive cells,
both from cell lines and primary MPN patient blood or bone
marrow mononuclear cells, in short-term assays. Furthermore, it suppressed (but not completely abrogated) the
growth of blast forming unit-erythroid (BFUE) colonies from
primary PV patient blood or bone marrow mononuclear cells
in 14-day clonogenic assays (13). Indeed, treatment with

Stroma impedes atiprimod-induced inhibition of JAK2,
STAT3, and STAT5 phosphorylation in JAK2V617Fpositive cells
FDCP-EpoRV617F cells were exposed to atiprimod in the
presence or absence of stroma and after 4, 24, and 48 hours
of culture and then cell aliquots were collected and subjected to
immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis. Whereas
untreated FDCP-EpoRV617F cells consistently, at every time
point, showed phosphorylation of JAK2, atiprimod exposure
resulted in significant reduction of JAK2 phosphorylation without altering total JAK2 levels: JAK2 remained dephosphorylated

Cytokine neutralization
Stromal cell monolayers were prepared in 6-well plates as
described earlier. After overnight incubation at 37 C, they
were washed with PBS 3 times at room temperature and
normal goat serum (1 mg/mL as a control), goat anti-humanIL-6 (0.3 mg), -CXCL-10/IP-10 (0.3 mg), or -FGF (0.3 mg)
antibodies (individually or in combination) were added to
culture together with culture medium at 37 C for 4 hours.
FDCP-EpoR-JAK2V617F cells (2  105/mL) were then dispensed
onto all wells (separated by micropore membranes from
stroma) and cultured in the presence of 1 mmol/L atiprimod.
After 48 hours of incubation at 37 C, FDCP-EpoRV617F
cells were collected and apoptosis was quantitated by flow
cytometry.

Figure 1. The effect of atiprimod and stromal cells on the proliferation of FDCP-EpoR JAK2V617F and SET-2 cells and primary polycythemia vera cell colonies.
A, both JAK2V617F-transduced FDCP-EpoR cells and human SET-2 cells were treated with increasing concentrations of atiprimod for 72 hours. The MTT assay
was used to assess cell proliferation. Data points represent the mean  SD from 3 independent measurements. A nonlinear regression model was applied to
the MTT results to estimate the IC50 values. B, monolayers of adherent primary TM-R1 stromal cells were grown and washed with PBS to remove the
nonadherent cell fraction. Then, bone marrow mononuclear cells (4  105/2 mL) from a JAK2V617F-positive PV patient were seeded on top and cocultured at
37 C in the absence (i and iii) or in the presence (ii and iv) of 1 mmol/L atiprimod. Cocultures were imaged at 24 hours (i and ii) and at 48 hours (iii and iv). Shortly
after seeding, JAK2V617F-positive cells were noted to cluster over and proliferate in intimate contact with TM-R1 cells. Primary JAK2V617F-positive cells
continued proliferating even in the presence of 1 mmol/L atiprimod when cocultured with TM-R1 stromal cells. Images were captured using a Nikon ELWD 0.3
phase-contrast microscope (10/0.25 objective lens; Nikon Corp) and a Nikon digital camera (D40; Nikon Corp) with Camera Control Pro Software.

even 48 hours postâ€“atiprimod treatment (Fig. 3A). However, if
FDCP-EpoRV617F were grown with HS5 or NK.tert stromal cells
while being treated with atiprimod, this pattern was significantly
altered. In the presence of stroma in culture, after 24 hours,
phosphorylation of JAK2 was partially restored and, after 48
hours, the phosphorylation of JAK2 returned to a level similar to
that of untreated cells (Fig. 3).
Because coculturing with stroma prevented the long-lasting
inhibitory effect of atiprimod on JAK2 phosphorylation and,
further, because in vitro expression of JAK2V617F results in
constitutive activation of the downstream signaling effectors
STAT3 and STAT5, we next examined the status of the latter
under the same culture conditions. FDCP-EpoRV617F and SET2 cells were exposed to 1 mmol/L atiprimod in the presence or
absence of HS5 (Supplementary Fig. S1A) or NK.tert (Supplementary Fig. S1B) stromal cells for 4, 24, and 48 hours.
Atiprimod caused complete, long-lasting inhibition of STAT3
and STAT5 phosphorylation in both FDCP-EpoRV617F and
SET-2 cells. However, if FDCP-EpoRV617F and SET-2 cells were
treated with atiprimod in the presence of stroma, the atiprimod-induced dephosphorylation of STAT3 and STAT5 was
transient, with phosphorylation fully restored within 48 hours
(Supplementary Fig. S1A and B). Therefore, atiprimod inhibits
signaling through the JAKâ€“STAT axis in JAK2V617F-positive
cells (causes dephosphorylation of JAK2, STAT3, and STAT5),

3834

but this effect is abrogated over time (i.e., 48 hours) if
JAK2V617F-positive cells are cocultured with stroma.
Next, we repeated the aforementioned experiments by
using peripheral blood and bone marrow mononuclear cells
from PV patients instead of JAK2V617F-positive cell lines.
Treatment of PV cells with 1 mmol/L atiprimod for 48 hours
resulted in their apoptosis (Fig. 4A). However, their treatment
in the presence of HS5 stroma completely abrogated the
proapoptotic activity of atiprimod (Fig. 4A). When primary
PV cells were treated with 1 mmol/L atiprimod in the presence
of HS5, NK.tert, or TM-R1 stroma, STAT3 phosphorylation was
preserved (Fig. 4B), whereas it was significantly reduced if
stromal cells were absent.
Stroma abrogates atiprimod-induced apoptosis of
JAK2V617F-cells in a cell contactâ€“independent manner
Given the protective effect of stroma on atiprimod-induced
apoptosis and JAK2â€“STAT pathway dephosphorylation, we
next explored the nature of the molecular cross-talk between
JAK2V617F-positive cells and stromal cells. To determine
whether the protective effect of stroma on JAK2V617F-carrying
cells in coculture assays was dependent on cell-to-cell interactions, we carried out cocultures in which JAK2V617F-positive
cells (FDCP-EpoRV617F and SET-2) were cultured either in
direct contact with stromal cell monolayers (i.e., HS5, NK.tert,

Figure 2. The effect of stromal cells on the atiprimod-induced apoptosis of cells expressing mutant JAK2V617F. A, FDCP-EpoRV617F cells were cultured
alone (control), or with atiprimod, with or without HS5 stromal cells. Following 48-hour culture, cells were harvested, stained with Annexin-V, and the
percentage of apoptotic cells was determined by flow cytometric analysis. Data from representative experiment are shown. Atiprimod-induced apoptosis
was dramatically impaired when JAK2V617F-positive cells were cocultured with stromal cells. B, FDCP-EpoRV617F and SET-2 cells were cultured without
(control) or with 3 different stromal cell monolayers (i.e., HS5, NK.tert, TM-R1) in the absence or presence of atiprimod for 48 hours. The induction of apoptosis
was then assessed by flow cytometry. Results represent the mean  SD from 3 independent experiments. GFP, green fluorescent protein.

TM-R1) or were separated from stroma by a 0.4-mm-thick
micropore membrane that interrupted cell-to-cell contact but
allowed them to be bathed by the same culture medium.
Atiprimod (1 mmol/L) induced apoptosis in approximately
90% of JAK2V617F-positive cells but caused minimal or no
apoptosis of any of the stromal cell lines (data not shown).
We exposed FDCP-EpoRV617F and SET-2 cells, which were
cocultured either directly onto HS5, NK.tert, or TM-R1 stromal
cell monolayers or separated from them by 0.4-mm-thick
micropore membranes to prevent direct cell-to-cell contact,
to atiprimod for 48 hours. Atiprimod failed to induce significant apoptosis regardless of whether JAK2V617F-positive
cells were cocultured in direct contact with stroma or separated from stromal cells by a membrane (Fig. 5; Supplementary Fig. S2).
Quantitation of secreted cytokines in coculture systems
The fact that stroma protects JAK2V617F-positive cells
from apoptosis without the requirement for direct cell-tocell contact led us to hypothesize that humoral factors
secreted by stromal cells may mediate such phenomenon.

www.aacrjournals.org

To investigate this hypothesis, the levels of 27 cytokines were
measured in serum-free supernatants from coculture assays
involving FDCP-EpoRV617F or SET-2 cells and HS5 or NK.tert
stromal cells, separated by a membrane, in the absence or
presence of 1 mmol/L atiprimod (Fig. 6). IL-6 levels changed
significantly over time in the coculture system (P < 0.00002)
in the presence of atiprimod; furthermore, CXCL-10/IP-10
levels changed (P < 0.05), although the fold increase observed
was more modest. In addition, we noticed that FGF showed
a marked upward trend in some of the cultures, but this
varied depending on the cell types involved (Fig. 6). We
therefore, examined the role of these 3 cytokines in subsequent experiments as representative of the changes in

Neutralization of selected cytokines abrogates the
protective effect of stroma on JAK2V617F-positive cells
To determine whether elevated cytokines detected in supernatants from coculture assays were stroma derived and to
confirm the potential paracrine protective effect of stroma on
JAK2V617F-positive cells, we carried out several experiments.

Atiprimod (Î¼mol/L)

CXCL-10/IP-10, or FGF antibodies diminished the protective
effect of stroma on FDCP-EpoRV617F cells against atiprimodinduced apoptosis (Fig. 7; Supplementary Fig. S3A and B).
Pretreatment of stroma with a combination of 2 or 3 monoclonal antibodies resulted in an additive effect, with the
highest neutralizing effect observed when all 3 antibodies
were used simultaneously. We replicated these results using
IL-6, CXCL-10/IP-10, and/or FGF antibodies in cocultures of
human SET-2 and TM-R1 cell lines (data not shown).
Second, we addressed the question whether supernatants
from cocultures of stromal and JAK2V617F cells would still be
protective for JAK2V617F cells in the absence of stromal cells.
FDCP-EpoRV617F cells were cocultured indirectly (separated
by 0.4-mm-thick micropore membranes) with HS5, NK.tert, or
TM-R1 stromal cells, with or without 1 mmol/L atiprimod, for
48 hours. Supernatants were then collected from different
cocultures and plated in new plates, and fresh FDCPEpoRV617F cells were added with 1 mmol/L atiprimod for 48
hours; induction of apoptosis was then assessed by flow
cytometry (Supplementary Fig. S4). Supernatants from cocultures containing stromal cells, FDCP-EpoRV617F cells, and
atiprimod (all together) protected FDCP-EpoRV617F cells the
most from atiprimod-induced apoptosis.

Discussion
Given that forced expression of JAK2V617F in cell lines
confers constitutive STAT5 activation, cytokine-independent
cell proliferation and enhanced cytokine sensitivity, targeted
pharmacologic inhibition of JAK2V617F kinase is an attractive

therapeutic strategy for patients with MPNs (2) However,
experimental evidence suggests that MPNs do not evolve
simplistically from HSC intrinsic defects. Rather, they are
heavily influenced by genetic and epigenetic events affecting
the bone marrow niche (17). Alterations of the extrinsic
regulation of HSC function have been shown to be capable
of overriding intrinsic cues in vivo and giving rise to MPNs as
observed in mice deficient for retinoic acid receptor gamma
and in those null for the cell-cycle-regulator retinoblastoma
protein (18). Therefore, in addition to genetic events in the
malignant clone, nongenetically determined alterations of the
bone marrow niche in patients with MPNs may be responsible
for response and resistance to treatment (17). Clonal MPN
cells engage in a constant cross-talk with the surrounding
marrow niche directly via adhesion molecules (e.g., N-cadherin, CD44) or indirectly via humoral factors (17, 19). Among
the latter, several circulating cytokines and chemokines
involved in HSC/HP proliferation and mobilization, as well
as promotion of fibrosis and angiogenesis (e.g., VEGF, TGFb,
IL-6), have been shown to be elevated in patients with PMF (8,
17). Although disrupting the cross-talk between the malignant
clone and its milieu is an attractive therapeutic strategy in
MPNs, little is known about the role of the abovementioned
humoral factors in the pathogenesis of MPNs or in the
response to MPN-directed therapy. To gain further insights
into the biology of the MPNâ€“stroma cross-talk, we explored
the interaction between the bone marrow stromal cells and
JAK2V617F-positive cells in the context of JAK2 inhibitor therapy. First, we established culture conditions to model the
effect of the marrow microenvironment on therapy response

in MPNs by using coculture assays that employed different
marrow stromal cells involving both murine cell lines and
human primary cells from patients with MPNs. Potent JAK2
inhibition with atiprimod very effectively suppressed the
growth and induced apoptosis of murine FDCP-EpoRV617Fand JAK2V617F-carrying human SET-2 cells while exerting
negligible inhibition on stromal cells. However, when
JAK2V617F-positive cells were cultured on monolayers of
stroma, the atiprimod-induced antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects were dramatically impaired, suggesting a
protective effect of the stroma on JAK2V617F-positive cells. It is
important to emphasize that our coculture assays obviated
the potential confounding bias of using cells of murine origin
as well as that of using stromal cell lines, in light of the fact
that we observed similar results when primary MPN cells and
stromal cells derived from patients with MPNs were employed
in the assays. In addition, similar results were observed when

3838

Cancer Res; 71(11) June 1, 2011

cocultures of malignant and stromal cells were conducted in a
species-mismatched manner.
We noted that the protective effect of stroma on the
malignant clone during JAK2 inhibitor therapy relates to
the fact that the former prevents the sustained inhibition
of phosphorylation of JAK2, STAT3, and STAT5 observed when
MPN cells are cultured in the absence of stroma. The full
extent of the stromal-mediated abrogation of JAK2 inhibitorâ€“
induced apoptosis of MPN cells was observed when JAK2V617Fpositive cells were separated from stroma by micropore filters
that prevented cell-to-cell contact while allowing both cell
types to be exposed to the same medium in coculture assays.
Thus, cell-to-cell contact does not appear essential for marrow
stroma to extend its protective effect on the malignant clone.
These results led us to hypothesize that the protection against
therapy-induced apoptosis exerted by bone marrow stroma
could be paracrine in nature. To test this hypothesis, we
profiled a large panel of soluble factors in serum-free supernatants generated in cocultures of JAK2V617F-positive cells on
a variety of stromal cells, separated by membranes, both
before and at different time points during atiprimod treatment. Although the levels of some cytokines varied depending
on the cell types involved in the coculture, 3 cytokinesâ€”IL-6,
CXCL-10/IP-10, and FGFâ€”exhibited increasing levels over
time in the presence of atiprimod. IL-6 is a pleiotropic
cytokine that, on binding to its receptor, causes activation
of the JAK2â€“STAT3 and ERK-1/2 pathways (20). Serum levels
of IL-6 were elevated during progression of patients with ET
and PV to myelofibrosis (21). FGF, a potent proangiogenic
factor, has been implicated in the pathogenesis of MPNs (8,
22). Although the role of the chemokine CXCL-10/IP-10 in
MPNs is yet to be defined, it has been shown to be constitutively secreted by acute myeloid leukemic blast cells (23). To
support a putative role of these soluble factors in treatment
resistance in our experiments, we utilized neutralizing monoclonal antibodies in coculture assays. Notably, pretreatment of
stromal monolayers with neutralizing antibodies against IL-6,
FGF, or CXCL-10/IP-10 markedly diminished the protective
stromal effect and restored atiprimod-induced apoptosis of
JAK2V617F-positive cells. Our experiments showed a role for
stroma-secreted cytokines (of which IL-6, FGF, and CXCL-10/
IP-10 are representative from our experiments) in response to
JAK2 inhibitor therapy. It is hypothesized that the inhibition of
JAK2 in our coculture systems altered its intracellular pathway
activation and that alternative pathways might have been
engaged, as a result of which cellular interaction and cytokine
production may have been modified.
In summary, we have standardized an in vitro culture
system that allows the interrogation of the cross-talk
between the malignant MPN clones and the stroma, as
well as the influence of the latter on the former during
therapy. This system has allowed us to identify a role for
stroma-derived cytokines in protecting the malignant
clones against JAK2-directed therapy. The therapeutic
implications of these findings are of importance and
may apply to other myeloid hematologic malignancies,
as has already been shown for lymphoid malignancies such
as CLL and ALL (9â€“11). Further research is warranted to
