Abstract
Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Germ-cell tumours (GCTs) are derived from germ cells and occur most frequently in the testes1,2.
GCTs are histologically heterogeneous and distinctly curable with chemotherapy3. Gains of
chromosome arm 12p and aneuploidy are nearly universal in GCTs4–6, but specific somatic
genomic features driving tumour initiation, chemosensitivity and progression are incompletely
characterized. Here, using clinical whole-exome and transcriptome sequencing of precursor,
primary (testicular and mediastinal) and chemoresistant metastatic human GCTs, we show that the
primary somatic feature of GCTs is highly recurrent chromosome arm level amplifications and
reciprocal deletions (reciprocal loss of heterozygosity), variations that are significantly enriched in
GCTs compared to 19 other cancer types. These tumours also acquire KRAS mutations during the
development from precursor to primary disease, and primary testicular GCTs (TGCTs) are
uniformly wild type for TP53. In addition, by functional measurement of apoptotic signalling
(BH3 profiling) of fresh tumour and adjacent tissue7, we find that primary TGCTs have high
mitochondrial priming that facilitates chemotherapy-induced apoptosis. Finally, by phylogenetic
analysis of serial TGCTs that emerge with chemotherapy resistance, we show how TGCTs gain
additional reciprocal loss of heterozygosity and that this is associated with loss of pluripotency
markers (NANOG and POU5F1)8,9 in chemoresistant teratomas or transformed carcinomas. Our
results demonstrate the distinct genomic features underlying the origins of this disease and
associated with the chemosensitivity phenotype, as well as the rare progression to
chemoresistance. These results identify the convergence of cancer genomics, mitochondrial
priming and GCT evolution, and may provide insights into chemosensitivity and resistance in
other cancers.

GCTs arise from germ cells, which can be found in the gonads (testicles and ovaries),
mediastinum, pituitary and retroperitoneum, and progress from precursor lesions (germ-cell
neoplasia in situ; GCNIS)1,2,10. Histologically, GCTs are classified as seminoma or nonseminoma. The latter may consist of one histology or be mixed non-seminoma. Clinically,
most GCTs are exceptionally chemosensitive; combination cisplatin- and etoposide-based
chemotherapy cures more than 80% of GCT patients with metastatic disease3. However,
approximately 10% of patients with metastatic GCTs will die as a result of chemoresistant
disease.
Leveraging preclinical models, several mechanisms have been proposed for GCT
oncogenesis and chemosensitivity, including DNA repair deficiencies, embryonic stem (ES)

cell-like cell cycle properties, or high apoptotic propensity11–13. Germline genome wide
association studies have identified several risk loci for GCT, most notably in KITLG14,15.
For GCTs, karyotyping demonstrated marked aneuploidy6, targeted sequencing identified
rare KRAS hotspot mutations16, and whole-exome sequencing (WES) confirmed nearly
universal arm-level chromosome arm 12p gain4, low mutation rates, and activating KIT
mutations specific to seminomas5. However, genomic features in GCTs that contribute to the
origins, chemosensitivity phenotype, and progression remain incompletely characterized.

Author Manuscript

Comparison of serial treatment-responsive and refractory tumours has informed genomic
progression in other cancers17,18. We proposed that genomic evolutionary analysis of
clinical GCTs from patients who respond and become resistant to chemotherapy would
identify features underlying disease progression and chemotherapy response phenotype. We
performed clinically integrated molecular analysis of 59 tumours samples (with matched
germ line) from 47 patients with TGCTs and two patients with primary mediastinal GCTs
(PMGCTs) to identify genomic features associated with disease origin and progression. The
aggregate cohort features are summarized in Fig. 1a and Supplementary Tables 1, 2.

Author Manuscript

The median mutational load in our cohort was 0.9 mutations Mb−1 (Supplementary Table 1).
Mutational significance analysis19 identified KRAS as the most statistically significant
altered gene in this cohort (Fig. 1a, b, Supplementary Table 3). The only other significantly
mutated gene was RPL5, a ribosomal protein previously implicated in other cancer types19
(Fig. 1b). RPL5 may regulate the MDM2–TP53 axis20 but was mutated infrequently and is
of unknown biological relevance in GCTs. KIT mutations were not observed in our cohort
despite sufficient genomic power to detect mutations (KIT hotspot loci mean coverage:
316×; range: 89–800×), although meta-analysis of our cohort with a separate TGCT WES
set5 confirms KIT as significantly mutated (Extended Data Fig. 1a). Expanded investigation
for clinically or biologically relevant alterations identified singleton mutations in DNA
repair or sex determination pathway gene sets (see Supplementary Table 4 for all somatic
mutations), although these were rare and of unclear significance.

Author Manuscript

Because KRAS emerged as the primary significantly mutated gene, we next sought to
explore the point of KRAS mutation emergence in the context of TGCT progression. We
performed phylogenetic analysis of WES from patient-matched GCNIS tumours (preinvasive) and primary TGCT tumours (Methods). In one representative case, both samples
contained chromosome arm 12p gain; however, the only somatic putative driver mutation
distinguishing the two samples was a KRASG12A mutation in the TGCT (0 out of 377 reads
in GCNIS, 65 out of 340 reads in TGCT) (Fig. 1c, Extended Data Fig. 2a). A similar pattern
of KRAS mutation exclusive to the TGCT and not in the patient-matched GCNIS was also
seen in a second patient (0 out of 210 reads in GCNIS, 35 out of 184 reads in TGCT) (Fig.
1d, Extended Data Fig. 2b). Although not required for progression, activating KRAS
mutations may occur after arm level gain of chromosome 12p, thereby indicating that these
are two separate processes involved in TGCT evolution.
While GCTs had low point mutation rates, nearly all tumours contained arm level gain of
chromosome arm 12p, as previously described5. Given previous reports of aneuploidy in
GCTs6,21, we performed allelic and absolute copy number analysis through allele

deconstruction22,23 to determine whether there were specific copy number patterns in GCTs
not been previously identifiable or reported (Methods). In a representative case (DFCI_7;
Fig. 2a), coverage-based copy number analysis identified 12p gain, but only allelic copy
number analysis revealed frequent arm and chromosome level gains of one parental allele
with simultaneous loss of the other parental allele, leading to loss of heterozygosity (LOH).
These reciprocal LOH (RLOH) events often maintained the germline number of DNA copies
(copy-neutral LOH), but also frequently have further amplification of the remaining parental
allele. For example, in DFCI_7 chromosome 4 has undergone copy-neutral LOH, whereas
chromosome 3q contains a LOH event in which the total copy number is three. Across the
GCT cohort, the mean number of chromosomal arm level amplifications was 28.3 ± 7.5
(mean ± s.d.), which is significantly increased compared to 6,509 tumours representing 19
other cancer types (P < 0.0001; Mann–Whitney) (Fig. 2b, Extended Data Fig. 3 and
Supplementary Tables 5, 6). Approximately 45% of arm level deletions contained a
compensatory reciprocal amplification in GCTs, again sharply increased compared to other
tumour types (P < 0.0001; Mann–Whitney) (Fig. 2c).

Author Manuscript

To validate this RLOH pattern, we performed the same analysis on a separate primary TGCT
fresh-frozen WES cohort (ICR GCT)5 and observed similar frequencies of reciprocal copy
number alterations (Fig. 2b, c, Extended Data Fig. 1b–d). Given the prevalence of arm level
amplifications observed in GCTs, we performed a permutation test involving deleted
chromosomal arms to examine whether these deletions would be compensatory by chance23
(Methods). We observed significantly increased reciprocal events in GCTs than expected by
chance (empirical P < 0.0001) (Fig. 2d). Finally, to examine whether this copy number
feature was an intrinsic germ-cell property and not related to microenvironmental features,
we performed absolute copy number analysis on three tumours originating in the testes with
non-germ-cell histologies and did not identify such chromosomal abnormalities (Extended
Data Fig. 4). Overall, GCTs have a unique pattern of highly recurrent reciprocal copy
number alterations in both discovery and validation cohorts.

Author Manuscript

Despite extensive copy number events in GCTs, all TGCTs were TP53 wild type, and we
only observed one TP53 mutation in a PMGCT. Transcriptome profiling of a patient subset
(n = 28: 21 primary TGCTs, five metastatic samples from TGCTs, and two PMGCT;
Methods) demonstrated TP53 expressed across histologies (Fig. 3a, Supplementary Table 7).
The overall constellation of genomic changes in clinical TGCT tumours—wild-type TP53,
chromosome arm 12p gain, and additional recurrent copy number changes—is similar to
adaptive mutations acquired by human ES cells during prolonged passaging in vitro24,25.
Like GCTs, ES cells are acutely sensitive to DNA damage induced by chemotherapy, and it
has been shown that this sensitivity is a result of intact p53 status and high mitochondrial
priming26. Also, one of the earliest identified susceptibility loci in TGCTs is in BAK1, a
BCL2 antagonist and pro-apoptotic gene14, and chemosensitivity in other cancer types has
been associated with increased mitochondrial priming7. We therefore proposed that the basis
of chemosensitivity in TGCTs with a wild-type TP53 and RLOH abundant genomic
background was a result of a fundamental apoptotic propensity caused by increased
mitochondrial priming. Mitochondrial priming refers to the intrinsic potential of cellular
apoptotic propensity due to the balance of pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic BCL2 family
proteins at the mitochondria, a feature that can be assessed by BH3 profiling27. To test this

hypothesis, we obtained fresh tumour samples from seven TGCTs (Fig. 3b) and performed
dynamic BH3 profiling on the tumours and adjacent normal tissue7 (Methods). In one
representative case, we observed an increase in BIM BH3-induced mitochondrial
depolarization between the tumour and adjacent normal (Fig. 3c) (P < 0.0001; paired t-test).
Across the seven samples, BIM BH3-induced mitochondrial priming remained significant
(Fig. 3d) (P < 0.0001; paired t-test). Thus, intact TP53, RLOH, and high mitochondrial
priming may form the foundation of chemosensitivity in TGCTs.

Although most TGCTs are cured with chemotherapy, some recur and approximately 10% of
patients with metastatic disease will die from chemoresistant TGCT. To track the genomic
evolution of chemoresistant TGCTs, phylogenetic analysis of 13 WES tumour samples (preand post-chemotherapy) from 5 patients was performed (Fig. 4, Extended Data Fig. 5,
Supplementary Table 8, Methods). Chromosome arm 12p was a truncal event shared in all
samples. In each patient, the resistant tumour that arose after either first- or second-line
chemotherapy accumulated additional copy number events, including reciprocal deletions
and events involving new chromosomes (Fig. 4). In one patient with serial tumours resected
over a 13-month period without intervening chemotherapy, the copy-number-derived
phylogeny was proportional to the sequence and elapsed time of sample acquisition (Fig.
4a). In two cases in which the final post-chemotherapy sample had teratoma and/or poorly
differentiated carcinoma components consistent with differentiation (Fig. 4b, c), complete
genome doubling was observed. Notably, the pluripotency and apoptosis regulators NANOG
and POU5F1 (also known as OCT3/4) expressed in GCT8,9,13 were not expressed in the
tumours obtained from metastatic deposits resistant to chemotherapy (Fig. 4e; P < 0.001,
Mann–Whitney). They were also not expressed in the two incurable PMGCTs (Fig. 4e,
Supplementary Table 7). Taken together, chemotherapy-resistant germ-cell tumours are
associated with continued progression of RLOH copy number events and loss of
pluripotency markers in this clinical cohort, although it is uncertain whether the loss of
pluripotency markers is a driver of chemoresistance11,28, a marker of methylation changes in
a further differentiated histology post-chemotherapy29, or a feature of both processes.

Author Manuscript

Overall, while GCTs represent a heterogeneous set of histological subtypes, they share a
distinct burden and pattern of reciprocal copy number alterations. This observation is
consistent with the notion that GCTs emerge, in part, through dysregulation in the mitosis/
meiosis switch from arrested gonocytes, since this process may result in abnormal
chromosomal segregation30 and persist during the evolution of GCTs. Expanded molecular
analysis may inform the initiators of RLOH and its role in oncogenesis. Subsets of these
tumours acquire KRAS-activating mutations, although the necessity for KRAS mutation is
less clearly defined, and these tumours lack recurrent nonsynonymous mutations in
established cancer genes19. Instead, chemosensitivity in TGCTs may be the result of high
mitochondrial priming properties, and molecular characterization paired with mitochondrial
priming studies of treatment-resistant tumours may inform features exclusive to this rare
patient subset with significant unmet medical need for new therapies. This strategy may also
inform strategies to improve the efficacy of chemotherapy in other malignancies.

METHODS
No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample size. The experiments were not
randomized, and investigators were not blinded to allocation during experiments and
outcome assessment.
Patient enrollment
Patients with GCTs with available tumour and germline samples provided informed consent
to an Institutional Review Board protocol that allows research molecular characterization of
tumour and germline samples (Dana-Farber Cancer Institute 10–025 and 11–104). All
available cases that met these criteria were included in this study. The clinical characteristics
for these patients are available in Supplementary Tables 1 and 2.

Pathology review and sample processing
All samples were reviewed by a genitourinary oncology pathologist (M.H.). After fixation
and mounting, 5–10 10-μm slices from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumour
blocks were obtained, and tumour-enriched tissue was macrodissected. Paraffin was
removed from FFPE sections and cores using CitriSolv (Fisher Scientific), followed by
ethanol washes and tissue lysis overnight at 56 °C. Samples were then incubated at 90 °C to
remove DNA crosslinks, and DNA (and when possible, RNA) extraction was performed
using Qiagen AllPrep DNA/RNA Mini Kit (51306). Germline DNA was obtained from
adjacent normal tissue or peripheral blood mononuclear cells.
WES

Author Manuscript

WES from FFPE tumour samples and matched germline DNA was performed as previously
described32.
Library construction

Author Manuscript

DNA libraries for massively parallel sequencing were generated as previously described32
with the following modifications: the initial genomic DNA input into the shearing step was
reduced from 3 μg to 10–100 ng in 50 μl of solution. For adaptor ligation, Illumina pairedend adapters were replaced with palindromic forked adapters (purchased from Integrated
DNA Technologies) with unique 8-base index molecular barcode sequences included in the
adaptor sequence to facilitate downstream pooling. With the exception of the palindromic
forked adapters, all reagents used for end repair, A-base addition, adaptor ligation, and
library enrichment PCR were purchased from KAPA Biosciences in 96-reaction kits. In
addition, during the post-enrichment solid phase reversible immobilization bead cleanup,
elution volume was reduced to 20 μl to maximize library concentration, and a vortexing step
was added to maximize the amount of template eluted from the beads. Libraries with
concentrations above 40 ng μl−1, as measured by a PicoGreen assay automated on an Agilent
Bravo instrument, were considered acceptable for hybrid selection and sequencing.

Solution-phase hybrid selection

Author Manuscript

The exon capture procedure was performed as previously described32: before hybridization,
any libraries with concentrations >60 ng μl−1 (as determined by PicoGreen) were brought to
60 ng μl−1, and 8.3 μl of library was combined with blocking agent, bait, and hybridization
buffer. Libraries with concentrations between 50 and 60 ng μl−1 were normalized to 50 ng
μl−1, and 10.3 μl of library was combined with blocking agent, bait, and hybridization buffer.
Libraries with concentrations between 40 and 50 ng μl−1 were normalized to 40 ng μl−1, and
12.3 μl of library was combined with blocking agent, bait, and hybridization buffer. Finally,
the hybridization reaction was reduced to 17 h; with no changes to the downstream capture
protocol.
Preparation of libraries for cluster amplification and sequencing

Author Manuscript

After post-capture enrichment, libraries were quantified using PicoGreen, normalized to
equal concentration using a Perkin Elmer MiniJanus instrument, and pooled by equal
volume on the Agilent Bravo platform. Library pools were then quantified using quantitative
PCR (KAPA Biosystems) with probes specific to the ends of the adapters; this assay was
automated using Agilent’s Bravo liquid handling platform. On the basis of quantitative PCR
(qPCR) quantification, libraries were brought to 2 nM and denatured using 0.2 N NaOH on
the Perkin-Elmer MiniJanus. After denaturation, libraries were diluted to 20 pM using
hybridization buffer purchased from Illumina.
Cluster amplification and sequencing

Author Manuscript

Cluster amplification of denatured templates was performed according to the manufacturer’s
protocol (Illumina), HiSeq v3 cluster chemistry and flowcells, as well as Illumina’s
Multiplexing Sequencing Primer Kit, were used. DNAs were added to flowcells and
sequenced using the HiSeq 2000 v3 Sequencing-by-Synthesis method, then analysed using
RTA v.1.12.4.2 or later. Each pool of whole exome libraries was subjected to paired 76 bp
runs. An 8-base index-sequencing read was performed to read molecular indices, across the
number of lanes needed to meet coverage for all libraries in the pool.
Alignment/assembly

Author Manuscript

Exome sequence data processing was performed using established analytical pipelines at the
Broad Institute. A BAM file was produced with the Picard pipeline (http://
picard.sourceforge.net/), which aligns the tumour and normal sequences to the hg19 human
genome build using Illumina sequencing reads. The BAM was uploaded into the Firehose
pipeline (http://www.broadinstitute.org/cancer/cga/Firehose), which manages input and
output files to be executed.
Sequencing quality control
Quality control modules within Firehose were applied to all sequencing data for comparison
of the origin for tumour and normal genotypes and to assess fingerprinting concordance.
Cross-contamination of samples was estimated using ContEst33. Samples with greater than
5% contamination or tumour purity less than 15% were excluded. All BAM files for this

cohort are shared in dbGaP (phs000923.v1.p1). BAM files from the ref. 5 cohort were
obtained through the European Genome-Phenome Archive (EGAS00001001084).
Mutation calling and significance analysis
MuTect34 was applied to identify somatic single-nucleotide variants. Strelka35 was applied
to identify small insertions or deletions. Artefacts introduced by DNA oxidation during
sequencing were computationally removed using a filter-based method36. Mutations with
allelic fractions of less than 0.05 excluded. Annotation of identified variants was done using
Oncotator37. Mutational significance analysis was performed using MutSigCV38. Manual
review of mutations in putative significantly mutated genes was subsequently performed
using Integrated Genomics Viewer39.

Author Manuscript

To compare mutations between distinct samples from the same patient, we used a previously
described method17 designed to recover evidence for mutations called in one sample in all
other samples derived from the same individual. In brief, the ‘force-calling’ method uses the
strong prior of the mutation being present in at least one sample in the patient to more
sensitively detect and recover mutations that might otherwise be missed.
Copy number and phylogenetic analysis

Author Manuscript

Copy-ratio profiles were inferred using ReCAPSEG (http://gatkforums.broadinstitute.org/
gatk/categories/recapseg-documentation). Read depth at capture probes in tumour samples
was normalized using a panel of normal samples to model noise and other biases. The
resulting normalized copy ratios are then segmented using the circular binary segmentation
algorithm40. These data were then transformed into allelic copy number data via integration
of allele fraction data from informative germline SNPs. Allelic copy number data allow for
inference of contribution of each homologous allele to observed copy number shifts as well
as identification of copy neutral events17,18. Finally allelic copy number data was integrated
with data from point mutations and short deletions and insertions as input to ABSOLUTE22.

Author Manuscript

The ABSOLUTE algorithm was used as previously described to generate purity and ploidy
solutions for each tumour samples (Supplementary Table 6). These solutions provided
estimates of total allelic copy number and cancer cell fraction for mutations and copy
number events in the tumour samples. ABSOLUTE solutions were selected using manual
curation. Using methods previously described23, we performed allelic deconstruction using
ABSOLUTE copy number data. In brief, deconstructions are performed using a Bayes
approach in which likelihood of event progressions are defined probabilistically. We defined
copy number events as arm level if the event spanned at least 80% of that arm and affected at
least one allele. Events were described as reciprocal if homologous chromosomes were
amplified and deleted. We used the allelic copy number deconstructions to draw
phylogenetic trees. A copy number event was considered shared between two related
samples if each of those samples contained an event whose start points fell within two
probes of one another, whose end points fell within two probes of one another, and whose
event amplitude was identical. Arm lengths are proportional to number of events delineating
the samples on the ends of the branch.

We performed a permutation test of arm level deletions to determine the empirical
significance of the observed rate of reciprocal deletions in our data set as previously
described22. In brief, arm level deletions were shuffled between arms while keeping total
deletions per sample constant. For each permutation the number of reciprocally deleted
chromosome arms were counted. In 10,000 iterations we did not observe the number of
reciprocal events in our data set.
Whole transcriptome sequencing and analysis: cDNA library construction

Author Manuscript

Total RNA was assessed for quality using the Caliper LabChip GX2. The percentage of
fragments with a size greater than 200 nucleotides (DV200) was calculated using software.
An aliquot of 200 ng of RNA was used as the input for first strand cDNA synthesis using
Illumina’s TruSeq RNA Access Library Prep Kit. Synthesis of the second strand of cDNA
was followed by indexed adaptor ligation. Subsequent PCR amplification enriched for
adapted fragments. The amplified libraries were quantified using an automated PicoGreen
assay. Approximately 200 ng of each cDNA library, not including controls, was combined
into 4-plex pools. Capture probes that target the exome were added, and hybridized for
recommended time. After hybridization, streptavidin magnetic beads were used to capture
the library-bound probes from the previous step. Two wash steps effectively remove any
non-specifically bound products. These same hybridization, capture and wash steps are
repeated to assure high specificity. A second round of amplification enriches the captured
libraries. After enrichment the libraries were quantified with qPCR using the KAPA Library
Quantification Kit for Illumina Sequencing Platforms and then pooled equimolarly. The
entire process is in 96-well format and all pipetting is done by either Agilent Bravo or
Hamilton Starlet.

Author Manuscript

Illumina sequencing
Pooled libraries were normalized to 2 nM and denatured using 0.1 N NaOH before
sequencing. Flowcell cluster amplification and sequencing were performed according to the
manufacturer’s protocols using HiSeq 2500. Each run was a 76-bp paired-end with an 8-base
index barcode read. Data was analysed using the Broad Picard Pipeline which includes demultiplexing and data aggregation.
Analysis
All BAMs were deduplicated using Samtools41 before gene expression quantification. Gene
expression quantification was performed using RSEM42 to generate transcripts per million.
Comparison of gene expression was performed for POU5F1 and NANOG with Mann–
Whitney test.

BH3 profiling
Normal and cancer testicular tissue was obtained from the Brigham and Women’s Hospital
Pathology Department (M.H.). Normal and tumour tissue was immediately processed.
Tissue was chopped with a razor blade for 2 min until the tissue was a fine paste. It was then
digested in trypsin with 10 mg ml−1 collagenase IV and 10 U ml−1 DNase I. The tissue was
then incubated in digestion buffer at 37 °C for 21 min, vortexing hard every 7 min. The

μM filter to generate a single-cell suspension. The cells were spun down, washed once with
PBS, and red blood cells were lysed using RBC lysis buffer. Cells were washed again with
PBS, counted, and then used for BH3 profiling analysis27,43.

Extended Data Figure 5. Phylogenetic analysis of DFCI_4

Histology proportion is indicated by pie charts within each phylogenetic tree. Phylogenetic
trees were constructed using allelic copy number deconstructions. Branch lengths are
proportional to the number of deconstructed copy number events. Branches leading to
primary samples are red, and branches leading to metastases are purple. The dotted branch
indicates deconstructions which may be impacted by FFPE sample degradation, limiting
discrete branch length estimation.

Figure 1. Mutational landscape and evolution from precursor lesions

Author Manuscript

a, Clinical and genomic overview. Each column represents a patient sample. The top four
rows represent chemoresistant disease status, overall survival (OS) vital status, predominant
histological classification of the primary sample (when available, or selected secondary
sample otherwise), and anatomic site, respectively. The next three rows indicate the patient’s
mutation status for the two significantly (*q < 0.1) mutated genes, and TP53. Next median
copy number of chromosome arm 12p is shown, followed by the focal amplification status
of KRAS (defined as KRAS copy number greater than 2× median 12p copy number). NSSD refers to non-seminoma with sarcoma differentiation. b, Mutations in KRAS and RPL5.
Each circle represents a mutation observed in a single patient, and labels indicate amino acid
change. c, d, Phylogenetic relationship between GCNIS and primary TGCT. Histological
slide images from DFCI_55 and DFCI_61 are shown on the left. Images in the pink borders
are GCNIS and below in yellow are tumour images. Dark blue ink indicates the border of the
lesion. Next to the histological images are phylogenetic trees determined by shared allelic
copy number (CN) mutations. The non-shaded circle at the top of the tree indicates the
patient’s germ line. Below that the filled grey is the inferred shared ancestor clone and then
each sample branches ends in the sequenced sample. Above are allelic copy number data
supporting the tree.

a, Representative allelic somatic copy number data. Top, coverage-derived copy number
events in a tumour. Bottom, the allele fraction of germ-line variants observed in the tumour.
Regions in which there is LOH are coloured in purple and orange for the retained and lost
allele, respectively. b, Arm level amplification rates in GCTs and 19 other tumour types (see
https://gdc.cancer.gov/resources-tcga-users/tcga-code-tables/tcga-study-abbreviations for
abbreviations). Shown are the distributions of counts of arm level amplifications, after
controlling for whole-genome doubling, in samples from each tumour type. The
distributions are estimated using a Gaussian kernel density31 and the median count is
indicated by the black bar. GCTs (purple, with the independent replication series denoted as
ICR GCT) have significantly more arm level amplifications than other tumour types (gold)
(P < 0.0001; Mann–Whitney). c, Rate of reciprocal deletion on arms with amplification in
GCTs and 19 other tumour types. For each sample, we counted the number of arm level
amplifications with and without a reciprocal deletion. Shown are the mean fractions of
amplified arms with a reciprocal arm level deletion, after controlling for whole-genome
doubling. GCTs (purple) have significantly more reciprocal deletions than other tumour
types (gold) (P < 0.0001; Mann–Whitney). d, Permutation test of arm level deletions. To
generate a null distribution of reciprocal deletions, we shuffled arm level deletions within
samples23 and for each permutation we counted the number of observed reciprocal arm level
deletions. Shown is a histogram of the counts of reciprocal deletions observed in
permutations. The red line indicates the number observed in our dataset corresponding to an
empirical P < 0.0001.

Figure 3. Mitochondrial priming in germ cell tumours

Author Manuscript

a, Gene expression of TP53 in GCTs. Values are in transcripts per million (TPM). b, BH3
profiling pipeline schematic. Samples were collected surgically and then processed
immediately as previously described7. Mitochondrial priming was measured in both the
tumour and normal samples after exposure to each peptide at varying concentrations. The
priming caused by each peptide is compared to the negative and positive controls
(dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) and the uncoupler carbonyl cyanide-ptrifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP), respectively) and between the tumour and
normal sample. BAD, BIM, HRK and PUMA denote BH3- only BCL2 proteins, and the
values (0.3, 1, 100) represent micromolar concentrations. c, Example comparison of peptideinduced depolarization in a tumour and normal sample. Mean depolarization across three
replicates for the tumour (purple) and normal (grey) samples are shown. The tumour shows
significantly more mitochondrial priming then the normal sample (P = 2.17 × 10−5; paired ttest). d, BH3 peptide profiling in tumour-normal pairs. Shown is the mean depolarization
across replicates for seven tumour and normal samples subjected to each peptides at the
maximum concentration. Matched tumour (purple) and normal (grey) samples are connected
in red. Error bars in c and d denote s.d. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; NS, not significant (P >
0.05); paired t-test.

Figure 4. Phylogenetic analysis and pluripotency of primary and metastatic GCTs

Author Manuscript

a–d, For each patient sample (DFCI_31 (a), DFCI_7 (b), DFCI_18 (c) and DFCI_9 (d)),
histology proportion is indicated by pie charts within each phylogenetic tree. Treatments
received after a given sample was acquired are listed below that respective sample (BEP,
bleomycin, etoposide, cisplatin; TIP, paclitaxel, ifosfamide, cisplatin; VIP, vinblastine,
ifosfamide, cisplatin). GD, genome doubling; RPLND, retroperitoneal lymph node
dissection. Phylogenetic trees were constructed using allelic copy number deconstructions
(Methods). Branches leading to primary samples are red, and branches leading to metastases
are purple. Dotted branches indicate deconstructions impacted by formalin-fixed, paraffinembedded (FFPE) sample degradation, limiting length estimation. For patient DFCI_31 (a)
the timeline below the tree shows time (months) and number of copy number events called
by allelic deconstruction between samples (C, chest wall; L1, lung-01; L2, lung-02; M,
mediastinal). e, Gene expression quantification of NANOG and POU5F1 in primary and
metastatic GCTs. Values are in transcripts per million. The red point denotes a TP53-mutant
mediastinal primary GCT (DFCI_19). **P < 0.01, Mann–Whitney test.
