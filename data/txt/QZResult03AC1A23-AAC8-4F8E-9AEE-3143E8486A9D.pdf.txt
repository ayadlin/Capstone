Abstract
Tubulysins are highly toxic tubulin-targeting agents with a narrow therapeutic window that are interesting
for application in antibody–drug conjugates (ADC). For full control over drug–antibody ratio (DAR) and the
effect thereof on pharmacokinetics and tumor targeting, a dual-labeling approach was developed, wherein the
drug, tubulysin variants, and the antibody, the anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody (mAb) trastuzumab, are
radiolabeled. 131I-radioiodination of two synthetic tubulysin A analogues, the less potent TUB-OH (IC50 > 100
nmol/L) and the potent TUB-OMOM (IC50, 1 nmol/L), and their direct covalent conjugation to 89Zrtrastuzumab were established. Radioiodination of tubulysins was 92% to 98% efﬁcient and conversion to
N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) esters more than 99%; esters were isolated in an overall yield of 68%  5% with
radiochemical purity of more than 99.5%. Conjugation of 131I-tubulysin–NHS esters to 89Zr-trastuzumab was
45% to 55% efﬁcient, resulting in ADCs with 96% to 98% radiochemical purity after size-exclusion chromatography. ADCs were evaluated for their tumor-targeting potential and antitumor effects in nude mice with
tumors that were sensitive or resistant to trastuzumab, using ado-trastuzumab emtansine as a reference. ADCs
appeared stable in vivo. An average DAR of 2 and 4 conferred pharmacokinetics and tumor-targeting behavior
similar to parental trastuzumab. Efﬁcacy studies using single-dose TUB-OMOM–trastuzumab (DAR 4) showed
dose-dependent antitumor effects, including complete tumor eradications in trastuzumab-sensitive tumors
in vivo. TUB-OMOM–trastuzumab (60 mg/kg) displayed efﬁcacy similar to ado-trastuzumab emtansine
(15 mg/kg) yet more effective than trastuzumab. Our ﬁndings illustrate the potential of synthetic tubulysins
in ADCs for cancer treatment. Cancer Res; 74(20); 5700–10. 2014 AACR.

Introduction
Continuing increases in the incidence of cancer, coupled
with the limitations of traditional chemotherapy, such as
systemic toxicity and rapid development of multidrug
resistance (1), have made the development of new therapeutic strategies a high priority. One of the most promising
recent developments is targeted therapy, where drugs or
other compounds are used that speciﬁcally interfere with

targets involved in tumor growth and progression. Monoclonal antibodies (mAb) are a good example of targeted
therapy and can also be used as a vehicle for toxic compounds, to form antibody–drug conjugates (ADC; ref. 2).
The ideal ADC allows application of highly toxic compounds otherwise having exceedingly narrow therapeutic
windows and exhibits higher tumor toxicity than current
chemotherapeutics (3). In this context, the chemical synthesis of naturally occurring highly potent compounds and
their derivatives becomes an important topic in ADC development. A very promising family of such compounds is
represented by the tubulysins, which are tetrapeptides
produced in small quantities by myxobacteria strains. The
cytotoxic activity of tubulysins stems from their ability to
inhibit tubulin polymerization and to disintegrate microtubules of dividing cells. Naturally occurring tubulysins
have IC50 values between 0.01 and 10 nmol/L and can be
chemically synthesized (ref. 4; for a comprehensive list of
references see ref. 5). Over the last decade, various tubulysin
analogues with different cytotoxic potency were synthesized (5, 6). Preclinical studies showed that tubulysins are
too toxic for use as single-agent chemotherapeutics (7), and
therefore targeted therapy becomes an appealing option to
enable the administration of higher doses of tubulysins,

Radiolabeling Monitored Tubulysin to Trastuzumab Conjugation

thus avoiding or minimizing systemic toxicity. Combining
targeted therapy of mAbs with toxic agents might in fact
result in highly speciﬁc and well-tolerated ADCs (8).
Over the last few years, several ADCs have entered phase
II/III clinical trials. Two of these, brentuximab vedotin and
ado-trastuzumab emtansine (Adcetris and Kadcyla ¼ T-DM1),
are U.S. Food and Drug administration (FDA)–approved and
are now used to treat patients with Hodgkin disease and HER2positive (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2) metastatic breast cancer, respectively. These and most of the other
ADCs still in development consist of chimeric, humanized or
fully human mAbs conjugated to tubulin-targeting inhibitors
or DNA-damaging agents (9).
Most ADCs consist of three components: the mAb, the
toxic compound and a linker that combines the two parts.
Three types of linkers are used to couple the mAb and the
toxic compound: releasable, cleavable, and noncleavable
linkers (10). Releasable linkers form a relatively stable ADC
in serum and release the drug upon internalization in the
cell. Accordingly, selective tumor release is due to the
difference in composition between plasma and cytosol.
Examples of releasable linkers are hydrazones and disulﬁdes
(11–14). ADCs containing a cleavable linker are about 100
times more stable in serum compared with ADCs with a
releasable linker. An example is the peptide based p-aminobenzyl carbamate linker, which is used in the clinically
available ADC brentuximab vedotin (15, 16). Noncleavable
linkers result in the most stable ADCs. Only upon internalization of the complete ADC and after degradation of the
mAb the toxic part including an amino acid residue is
released and can become active. Thioether bonds formed
from SMCC [succinimidyl-4-(N-maleimidomethyl)cyclohexane-1-carboxylate] are reported to be noncleavable linkers.
Ado-trastuzumab emtansine contains this SMCC-based link-

er and was proved to give the best efﬁcacy and lowest
systemic toxicity compared with analogues with cleavable
linkers (12).
For testing the highly potent tubulysins in an ADC, we
chose to use the reliable and commonly used mAb trastuzumab (Herceptin) as the model mAb. Trastuzumab is a
humanized anti-HER2 mAb directed against the extracellular domain of HER2, and treatment with this mAb is the
standard of care as adjuvant treatment in patients with
HER2-positive primary breast cancer and ﬁrst and following
lines of metastatic breast cancer. In view of the extreme
toxicity of tubulysins, we regard a stable, noncleavable
linkage mandatory. Because we and others (17, 18) have
shown that the thioether bond is not such a noncleavable
bond as presumed, we chose not to use a linker and opted for
a noncleavable bond that has found multiple applications in
the clinic (17, 19), namely a direct amide bond formation of
tubulysins with lysine residues of the mAb. In fact, tubulysins possess a C-terminal carboxylic acid group enabling
direct coupling with these lysine residues after conversion to
an active ester.
Before an ADC can be used in in vivo experiments, the
stability of the conjugate must be conﬁrmed. Also, knowledge of the pharmacokinetics can be informative for future
development. For a thorough study of the targeting behavior
of the ADCs and their in vitro and in vivo stability, and to
facilitate monitoring of conjugation and puriﬁcation procedures, we decided to radiolabel the tubulysin analogues as
well as the mAb. In the present study, we describe the 131Iradioiodination of two synthetic tubulysin A analogues, the
less potent TUB-OH and the potent TUB-OMOM, and the
conjugation of these 131I-labeled tubulysins to nonlabeled or
89
Zr-labeled trastuzumab (Fig. 1). The obtained ADCs were
evaluated in vitro for effects on cell viability, and in vivo for

their pharmacokinetic behavior and tumor-targeting potential. After determination of the maximum-tolerated dose
(MTD), antitumor effects of the most potent ADC were
tested in nude mice bearing trastuzumab-resistent JIMT or
trastuzumab-sensitive N87 tumors using ado-trastuzumab
emtansine as reference.

Materials and Methods
General materials and methods
Cell lines used were the breast cancer lines MDA-MB231,
JIMT, and SKBR3, the ovarian cancer cell line SKOV, and the
gastric cancer cell line N87. JIMT-1 was obtained from DSMZ
Germany on March 19, 2012, after cytogenetic testing, and
used within 6 months after resuscitation. NCI-N87 was
obtained from ATCC United Kingdom on February 29,
2012, after cytogenetic testing, and used within 6 months
after resuscitation. SKBR3 was obtained from Dr. T. Oude
Munnink (Department of Medical Oncology, University
Medical Center Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands),
MDA-MB-231 from Roche, and SK-OV-3 from the Department of Medical Oncology, VU University Medical Center
Amsterdam. All cell lines were checked for primary growth
characteristics (morphology and growth rate) and HER2
expression. MDA-MB231 is a cell line with low HER2 expression; SKBR3, SKOV, and N87 are overexpressing HER2; and
JIMT is developed from tumor cells of a patient with
trastuzumab resistance and is HER2-positive (20). 131I
(56.6 GBq/mL in 0.1 mol/L NaOH) was purchased from GE
Healthcare or PerkinElmer, 124I (1.2 GBq/mL in 0.02 mol/L
NaOH) and 89Zr (0.15 GBq/nmol in 1 mol/L oxalic acid)
were obtained from PerkinElmer. The tubulysin analogues
TUB-OH and TUB-OMOM were synthesized by KemoTech
(www.kemotech.it). Trastuzumab and ado-trastuzumab
emtansine were obtained from the hospital pharmacy.
High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analyses
were performed using a Jasco HPLC system equipped with
a Jupiter 4u Proteo 90A Column (Phenomenex) using a
gradient of H2O/MeCN (both containing 0.1% TFA) as eluent
at a ﬂow rate of 1 mL/min for the analysis of the tubulysins
and a Superdex 200 10/30 GL size exclusion column (GE
Healthcare Life Sciences), using a mixture of 0.05 mol/L
sodium phosphate, 0.15 mol/L sodium chloride (pH 6.8), and
0.01 mol/L NaN3, as the eluent at a ﬂow rate of 0.5 mL/min for
analysis of the mAb constructs. The radioactivity of the eluate
was monitored using an inline NaI(Tl) radiodetector (Raytest
Sockett). Single/double isotope counting was performed with
a gamma-well counter (Wallac LKB-CompuGamma 1282;
Pharmacia) for 131I, 124I, and 89Zr. In case of dual isotope
measurements, cross-over corrections from one radionuclide
into the alternate window were performed using a standard of
each radionuclide.
Preparation of radioiodinated tubulysin esters
Tubulysin analogues TUB-OH (MW ¼ 687 g/mol) or TUBOMOM (MW ¼ 745 g/mol; Fig. 1) were dissolved in H2O/
MeCN (1/1) at a concentration of 3.1 mg/mL. Hundred
microliters of TUB-OH (450 nmol) or TUB-OMOM

5702

Cancer Res; 74(20) October 15, 2014

(415 nmol) was incubated with 30 mL MeCN, 100 mL 0.5
mol/L phosphate buffer (pH 7.2), 3 to 100 MBq 131I (volume:
4–8 mL), and 25 mL (50 mg; 2 mg/mL) chloramine-T, by
shaking in a Thermomixer at 550 rpm at room temperature.
After 2 minutes, the reaction was stopped with 10 mL Na2
SO3 (20 mg; 20 mg/mL) and a 1-mL sample was taken and
diluted to 20 mL with H2O/MeCN (7/3) for HPLC analysis of
the radioiodinated tubulysin and assessment of radiolabeling efﬁciency. Unreacted 131I and reduced chloramine-T
were removed by use of a Seppak tC2 Light column
(Waters), via loading of the mixture on the column and
washing with 10 mL H2O. Subsequently, 131I-TUB-OH or
131
I-TUB-OMOM was eluted from the Seppak with 2 mL
MeCN, thereafter the MeCN was evaporated under a
nitrogen ﬂow at 39 C. Next, 8 mg N-hydroxysuccinimide
(NHS; Sigma-Aldrich; 0.07 mmol) in 500 mL MeCN was
added to the dried 131I-TUB-OH or 131I-TUB-OMOM. The
esteriﬁcation was started by adding approximately 25 mg
EDC [1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide; 0.16
mmol] as a solid. After 30 minutes in an ultrasonic bath, the
reaction mixture was diluted 10-fold with H 2O and trapped
on a Seppak tC2 Light column. Unreacted/excess NHS and
EDC side products were removed by washing with 25 mL H2
O, after which 131I-TUB-OH-NHS or 131I-TUB-OMOM-NHS
was eluted from the inverted Seppak column with 2 mL
MeCN. After MeCN evaporation at 39 C under a nitrogen
ﬂow, the products were redissolved in 55  5 mL MeCN and
stored at 80 C.
Preparation of single- and dual-labeled ADCs
Trastuzumab (2 mg, 95 mL; 13.3 nmol; 21 mg/mL) was
mixed with 0.9% sodium chloride (900 mL) and 50 mmol/L
Na2CO3 (7 mL), after which 4 or 8 equivalents (eq; 53 or
106 nmol) of 131I-TUB-OH-NHS or 131I-TUB-OMOM-NHS
in MeCN (10–20 mL) were added and incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature in a Thermomixer at 550 rpm.
The ADC, 131I-TUB-OH-trastuzumab, or 131I-TUB-OMOMtrastuzumab containing on average either two or four
tubulysin molecules per mAb molecule (2 eq, respectively,
4 eq), was puriﬁed using a PD-10 column (GE Healthcare)
or HiTrap Desalting Column (GE Healthcare). Protein
concentration was determined by HPLC using a calibration
curve of trastuzumab. Instant thin layer chromatography
(iTLC) analysis of the ADCs was carried out to assess the
conjugation efﬁciency and radiochemical purity of the
ADC. Silica-impregnated glass ﬁber sheets (PI Medical
Diagnostic Equipment BV) were used with 20 mmol/L
citrate buffer (pH 5.0)/MeOH (3/7) as the mobile phase.
As readout gamma-well counting or phosphor imager
analysis (FLA 8000; GE Healthcare) followed by quantiﬁcation with ImageQuant software was used.
Dual-labeled 131I-TUB-OMOM–89Zr-trastuzumab was
obtained from 89Zr-labeled trastuzumab (2 mg in 1 mL
0.9% NaCl, 13.3 nmol, 3.2 MBq 89Zr) following exactly the
same procedure as described above. Premodiﬁcation of
trastuzumab (5 mg, Df/mAb molar ratio 0.5) and labeling
with 89Zr (10 MBq) was performed according to part 1 and
3 of the protocols described by Cohen and colleagues (21).

Radiolabeling Monitored Tubulysin to Trastuzumab Conjugation

Stability and in vitro cell binding of the ADCs
ADCs 131I-TUB-OH–trastuzumab and 131I-TUB-OMOM–
trastuzumab were stored at 4 C in 0.9% NaCl and at 37 C in
0.9% NaCl or 60% human serum. At different time points,
radiochemical purity of the conjugates was measured by
iTLC, while conjugate integrity was analyzed by SDS-PAGE
followed by phosphor imager analysis. For SDS-PAGE,
samples were mixed at 1:1 with loading buffer and run on
a Phastgel System (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) using
preformed 7.5% SDS-PAGE gels under nonreducing conditions. The gel was analyzed using a phosphor imager
and quantiﬁed with ImageQuant software. In vitro binding
characteristics of the ADCs were determined in an immunoreactivity assay essentially as described by Lindmo and
colleagues (22), using a serial dilution of 0.2% glutaraldehyde-ﬁxed N87 cells and a ﬁxed amount of ADC 131I-TUBOH–trastuzumab or 131I-TUB-OMOM–trastuzumab (5–15
ng). After overnight incubation at 4 C, the cell suspension
was centrifuged and the speciﬁc binding calculated as the
ratio of cell-bound radioactivity to the total amount of
radioactivity in the assay. This was corrected for nonspeciﬁc binding, as determined with a 500-fold excess of
nonradioactive trastuzumab. All binding assays were performed in triplicate.
In vitro cell viability assay
The effects of the tubulysins TUB-OH and TUB-OMOM,
the ADCs 131I-TUB-OH–trastuzumab and 131I-TUB-OMOM–
trastuzumab (both trace-dose 131I-labeled, to exclude radiation effects), and trastuzumab on cell viability of the cell
lines MDA-MB231, JIMT, SKBR3, SKOV, and N87 were measured with the CellTiter-Blue Assay. The cells were trypsinized and plated in 96-well, ﬂat-bottomed, tissue culture
plates at day 0. On day 1 TUB-OH, TUB-OMOM, 131I-TUBOH–trastuzumab, 131I-TUB-OMOM–trastuzumab, or trastuzumab were added at concentrations of 100, 10, 1, 0.1, and
0.01 nmol/L (in case of ADCs, concentration of the mAb was
used). On day 5, the CellTiter-Blue reagent was added and
incubated for 2 hours at 37 C, and viable cells were measured with a TeCan plate reader (Tecan Group Ltd.) at 560EX
/590EM nm. Fluorescence values of the samples were corrected for background of cell culture medium, the results,
presented as the percentage of survival, were calculated by
dividing the ﬂuorescence values of the treated cells by the
values of the untreated control cells.
Blood kinetics: 131I-TUB-OH–trastuzumab versus 124Itrastuzumab
For a ﬁrst indication of the pharmacokinetic behavior and
the in vivo stability of the conjugate, 131I-TUB-OH–trastuzumab was evaluated in non–tumor-bearing female nude
mice (Hsd athymic nu/nu, 25–32 g; Harlan CPB) and compared with 124I-trastuzumab via coinjection. Heretofore,
trastuzumab (250 mg) was reacted with 19 MBq 124I in the
presence of 0.5 mg NaI as carrier according to Tijink and
colleagues (23) Labeling efﬁciency was 96%, puriﬁcation
with PD10 resulted in a 99.9% pure 124I-trastuzumab. All
animal experiments were performed according to the Dutch

www.aacrjournals.org

National Institutes of Health principles of laboratory animal
care and Dutch national law ("Wet op de dierproeven," Stb
1985, 336). Mice were coinjected with 0.15 MBq 131I-TUBOH–trastuzumab (2 eq; 86 mg mAb) and 0.3 MBq 124Itrastuzumab (4 mg mAb) in a total volume of 120 mL,
intravenously. Blood was collected by tail laceration at 1,
2, 24, 48, 72, 96, and 168 hours p.i. Blood was weighed, and
the amount of radioactivity was measured in a gamma-well
counter with cross-over corrections. Radioactivity levels
were calculated as the percentage of the injected dose per
gram of tissue (%ID/g).
Biodistribution of dual-labeled 131I-TUB-OMOM–89Zrtrastuzumab conjugates
Biodistribution of 131I-TUB-OMOM–89Zr-trastuzumab (2
eq), 131I-TUB-OMOM–89Zr-trastuzumab (4 eq), and 89Zr-trastuzumab was compared in female nude mice (Hsd athymic nu/
nu, 25–32 g; Harlan CPB), bearing N87 or JIMT tumors on both
ﬂanks. Mice were injected (i.v.) in a total volume of 100 mL with
0.3 MBq (0.15 MBq of each isotope) 131I-TUB-OMOM–89Zrtrastuzumab (100 mg mAb). At 3, 24, 48, or 72 hours after
injection, the mice were anesthetized, bled, euthanized, and
dissected. Blood and organs were weighed, and further processed as described above.
To evaluate the biodistribution of unconjugated tubulysin, 8
mice were injected (i.v.) with 0.12 MBq 131I-TUB-OMOM (1.7
nmol in a 3:7 mixture of ethanol and 0.9% NaCl, an equal molar
amount of 131I-TUB-OMOM as received by mice injected with
131
I-TUB-OMOM–trastuzumab, 2 eq). After 1, 2, 3, and 24
hours, 2 mice were anesthetized, bled, euthanized, and dissected and further processed as described above.
In vivo MTD and therapy study
Before starting the therapy study, the MTD for TUBOMOM–trastuzumab was determined. For this purpose, ﬁve
groups of 5 nude mice were given 15, 30, 45, or 60 mg/kg trace
dose–labeled 131I-TUB-OMOM–trastuzumab (4 eq) or normal
saline as a control by an i.p. bolus injection. Trace-dose labeling
in this and subsequent experiments was only used to conﬁrm
tubulysin-to-mAb molar ratio. Body weight was measured
three times per week and MTD was reached when weight loss
was >10% compared with the control mice.
The therapeutic effectiveness of trace dose–labeled 131ITUB-OMOM–trastuzumab (4 eq) was studied in the same
nude mice models as described for the biodistribution study.
For this purpose, six groups of 7 mice with established JIMT or
N87 xenografts in both ﬂanks were used. The mean tumor size
at the start of the study was 85  15 mm3 and was similar for
the different treatment groups. All mice received an i.p. bolus
injection. Group 1 was the control group and received 200 mL of
saline solution. Group 2, 3, and 4 received 15, 30, and 60 mg/kg
of trace dose–labeled 131I-TUB-OMOM–trastuzumab (4 eq),
respectively, group 5 received 15 mg/kg trastuzumab and
group 6 received 15 mg/kg ado-trastuzumab emtansine.
Ado-trastuzumab emtansine was included in this study as a
reference ADC with proven clinical efﬁcacy. Body weight and
tumor volume were measured three times per week up to 3
months after end of treatment.

Statistical analysis
All animal experiments were statistically analyzed with
SPSS, version 21 (SPSS Inc.) using the Student t test for
independent samples. Two-sided signiﬁcance levels were
calculated, and P < 0.05 was considered statistically
signiﬁcant.

Results
Effects of TUB-OH and TUB-OMOM on in vitro cell
viability
The toxicity of TUB-OH and TUB-OMOM was determined in
the CellTiter-Blue Assays. Five different cell lines were incubated with TUB-OH or TUB-OMOM for 5 days. The HER2overexpressing cell lines N87, SKBr3, and SKOV, the trastuzumab-resistant cell line JIMT, and the HER2-negative cell line
MDA-MB231 were found to be relatively insensitive to TUB-OH
(Supplementary Fig. S1A), the corresponding IC50's are >100
nmol/L. However, TUB-OMOM (Supplementary Fig. S1B)
showed IC50 values between 0.4 and 6 nmol/L.
Preparation of radioiodinated tubulysin esters and their
corresponding ADCs
The tubulysin analogues TUB-OH and TUB-OMOM are
poorly soluble in aqueous solution and required the addition
of MeCN to obtain a homogeneous solution. Radioiodination
was carried out with [131I]iodide, using chloramine-T as
oxidant. The reaction depicted in Fig. 1 was performed in
a 7:3 (H2O/MeCN) solution, resulting in a radiolabeling
efﬁciency of 92% to 98% for 131I-TUB-OH and 131I-TUBOMOM (Fig. 2A). Puriﬁed 131I-TUB-OH and 131I-TUB-OMOM
were reacted with NHS (in MeCN) to form 131I-TUB-OH–
NHS and 131I-TUB-OMOM–NHS with a conversion >99%

(Fig. 2A). Via an inverted Seppak tC2 Light puriﬁcation
procedure, the radioiodinated tubulysin esters were isolated
in 68%  5% overall yield with a radiochemical purity of
>99.5%. The NHS esters were stored in a glass vial at 80 C
as a MeCN solution at a concentration of 5.3 nmol/mL. Esters
were produced with three different 131I-speciﬁc activities,
namely 114  6, 57  3, and 6  1 kBq/nmol.
For preparation of single- and dual-labeled ADCs, 2 mg
of trastuzumab bearing no radiolabel or labeled with 3 MBq
89
Zr were incubated with 4 (114 kBq 131I/nmol) or 8 (57 or
6 kBq131I/nmol) eq of 131I-TUB-OH–NHS or 131I-TUB-OMOM–
NHS at pH 9 for 30 minutes, resulting in 45% to 55%
conjugation efﬁciency (TLC) and with retention of integrity
(SDS-PAGE; Fig. 2B). Longer reaction times did not increase
conjugation efﬁciency. Puriﬁcation of the ADC was performed
using size exclusion chromatography and resulted in a radiochemical purity of 96% to 98% (PD10 columns or HiTrap
Desalting columns; Fig. 2B and C).
In vitro stability and effects on cell viability of ADCs
The stability of the ADCs was determined at 4 C in 0.9%
aqueous NaCl and at 37 C in 60% human serum (0.9% NaCl

immediately after ﬁltration of the product, the radiochemical
purity of the samples was 98% under both conditions. After
5 days in NaCl at 4 C, no additional release of 131I was detected,
whereas in serum samples and NaCl at 37 C, an additional
3% to 4% release of 131I was observed. Lindmo assays showed
at t ¼ 0, a maximum binding between 93% and 96% to N87
cells. After 5 days, the binding assay showed a decrease of
maximum binding to 89% to 92%. However, when binding data
were corrected for release of 131I, no decrease of binding in time
became apparent.

Figure 3 shows the effect of trastuzumab, 131I-TUB-OH–
trastuzumab, 131I-TUB-OMOM–trastuzumab, and ado-trastuzumab emtansine on the viability of JIMT cells. The
tubulysin ADCs were only trace dose–labeled (6 kBq 131I/
nmol). No growth inhibition effect was seen of 131I-TUBOH–trastuzumab on JIMT cells; therefore, it is safe to say
that the low dose of radioactivity does not have an inﬂuence
on cell viability. Both 131I-TUB-OMOM–trastuzumab and
ado-trastuzumab emtansine caused a decrease in the viability of the JIMT cells compared with trastuzumab alone,
but the effect is not as strong as for TUB-OMOM alone
(Supplementary Fig. S1A).
Pharmacokinetics and tumor targeting of ADCs with 0, 2,
or 4 TUB molecules per mAb molecule
A pilot study was performed in non–tumor-bearing mice to
evaluate the effect of tubulysin coupling on antibody pharmacokinetics. To this end, 124I-trastuzumab and 131I-TUB-OH–
trastuzumab (2 eq) were coinjected to compare the in vivo
behavior of the mAb. The blood kinetics did not show significant differences (P > 0.05): at 1 hour p.i. the blood levels were
29.6  2.0 and 31.5  2.3%ID/g and slowly decreased to 6.7 
0.8 and 5.4  1.0 for 124I-trastuzumab and 131I-TUB-OH-trastuzumab, respectively, at 168 hours (Supplementary Fig. S2).
These data indicate that coupling of tubulysins (2 eq) does not
alter pharmacokinetics of trastuzumab, and that conjugates
are stable in vivo in blood.
For a more detailed study of the effect of tubulysin coupling
on pharmacokinetics and tumor targeting, N87 and JIMT
tumor-bearing mice were injected with dual-labeled 131ITUB-OMOM–89Zr-trastuzumab (0, 2, or 4 eq) or with unconjugated 131I-TUB-OMOM to evaluate the kinetics of free drug
excretion. Figure 4 gives insight in the accumulation of the 2 eq(Fig. 4, left) and 4 eq-conjugate (Fig. 4, right) in the tumors and
organs of N87-bearing mice for both 89Zr and 131I. At 3, 24, 48,
and 72 hours p.i of the 2 eq-conjugate, blood levels for 131I were
not signiﬁcantly different from 89Zr, conﬁrming stability of the
conjugate in blood. The tumor uptake values for 131I were 7.8 
1.9, 18.6  3.8, 16.6  4.0, and 12.4  6.2 %ID/g and are lower
than those of 89Zr (8.4  2.0, 18.8  2.4, 20.5  4.7, and 21.2  4.6
%ID/g). This is most probably due to the fact that 131I is

released from the tumor cells after internalization, while 89Zr
residualizes inside the cells. At 3 hours p.i., no signiﬁcant
differences in 131I and 89Zr uptake in normal tissues were
observed, except for colon and ileum content where 131I
showed higher levels than 89Zr: 7.7  4.5 versus 0.6  0.3
%ID/g in case of colon content and 2.3  0.6 versus 0.2  0.03
%ID/g in case of ileum content. Like for tumors, also for normal
tissues 131I and 89Zr showed diverging uptake levels from 24
hours p.i. on, with differences becoming larger at later time
points after injection of 131I-TUB-OMOM–89Zr-trastuzumab.
Similar trends in biodistribution were observed for 131I-TUBOMOM–89Zr-trastuzumab (4 eq) in N87 tumor–bearing nude
mice (Fig. 4B) and for 131I-TUB-OMOM–89Zr-trastuzumab (2
and 4 eq) in JIMT-tumor–bearing nude mice (Supplementary
Fig. S3). Of note, in both tumor models 131I-TUB-OMOMconjugated 89Zr-trastuzumab (2 and 4 eq) did not show
signiﬁcant differences in blood levels as well as tumor uptake
levels when compared with unconjugated 89Zr-trastuzumab
(Supplementary Fig. S4).
We postulated that increased levels of 131I in colon and
ileum content might originate from a small proportion of
unconjugated 131I-TUB-OMOM present in the preparation for
injection, rather than from free 131I, as stomach content did
not contain elevated levels of 131I. To test this hypothesis, 131ITUB-OMOM was administered to tumor-free mice. Figure 5
conﬁrms that free 131I-TUB-OMOM shows rapid blood clearance and predominant accumulation in the colon and ileum
content.
In vivo MTD and therapy study
A MTD study was performed to determine the MTD of TUBOMOM–trastuzumab (4 eq). Nontumor-bearing mice were
injected with 15, 30, 45, or 60 mg/kg, single bolus injection.
No weight loss or other signs of toxicity were observed. Next,
the in vivo efﬁcacy of different doses of TUB-OMOM–trastuzumab was compared with trastuzumab and ado-trastuzumab
emtansine in JIMT- and N87-tumor–bearing mice. JIMT
tumors showed no signiﬁcant growth delay when injected
with 15, 30, or 60 mg/kg TUB-OMOM–trastuzumab or 15
mg/kg ado-trastuzumab emtansine compared with the mice
injected with trastuzumab alone (Supplementary Fig.

S5). Figure 6 shows that mice with N87 tumors responded when
injected with trastuzumab, but to a distinct lesser extent than
after injection of the ADCs. Tumor response upon treatment
with TUB-OMOM–trastuzumab was dose dependent with the
highest dose, 60 mg/kg, showing the same effect as ado-

Discussion
Stability in blood is a prerequisite in the development of
ADCs when highly toxic compounds like tubulysins are used,
because sequestration of the free drug in normal organs
might cause unacceptable toxicity. In addition, it is important to determine whether the tumor-targeting capacity of a
mAb is preserved upon coupling of such drugs and to gain
knowledge on antitumor effects as efﬁcacy strongly depends
on ADC internalization and intracellular processing. Most
studies focus on the antitumor effects of the ADC, while
neglecting thorough characterization of the ADC in vivo. The
easiest way to get this information is by using a strategy of
dual-radiolabeling in which drug and mAb each receive a
different radiolabel.

In this study, we developed procedures to radiolabel the less
potent TUB-OH (IC50 > 100 nmol/L) and the potent TUBOMOM (IC50, 0.4–6 nmol/L) with 131I, to convert them to an
active NHS ester, and to couple the esters successfully to
unlabeled or 89Zr-labeled trastuzumab. Conversion of the
131
I-labeled tubulysins to the NHS esters was >99%, while the
esters were isolated at an overall yield of 68%  5% and a
radiochemical purity of >99.5%. Conjugation of the 131I-tubulysin esters to unlabeled or 89Zr-labeled trastuzumab antibody
was 45% to 55% efﬁcient. Because all tubulysin analogues
possess a C-terminal carboxylic acid group, the conjugation
procedure developed herein is generally applicable for the
production of tubulysin ADCs. Radiochemical purity of the
radiolabeled ADCs was 96% to 98%, which leaves room for

improvement when tubulysin–antibody conjugates are prepared for clinical application.
Several radioiodination and esteriﬁcation routes were
explored before arriving at the current procedure. The
described mild radioiodination route makes use of chloramine-T as the oxidant, the presence of MeCN in the reaction
mixture prohibited the use of Iodogen-coated vials (24). The
tubulysins required the presence of a free phenol group on
the C-terminal amino acid fragment, tubulysins with a methoxyphenyl group could not be radioiodinated. 131I-TUB-OH
and TUB-OMOM were reacted with NHS, sulfoNHS, and TFPOH, only the NHS ester could be efﬁciently formed and puriﬁed
by Seppak. The TFP-ester did not elute from the Seppak (too
apolar) and sulfoNHS-ester was not trapped on the Seppak (too
polar). The radioiodine label also revealed that upon puriﬁcation with size exclusion chromatography, about 2% to 4% of
nonconjugated tubulysin coeluted with the ADC, possibly
because of trapping in the tertiary structure of the mAb
molecule.
Radioiodination of the tubulysins provided us with extra
information about the in vitro and in vivo stability of the
ADCs and their in vivo tumor-targeting characteristics. To
remain within the same drug–antibody ratio (DAR) as adotrastuzumab emtansine (DAR, 3–4), in this study, on average
2 or 4 eq of 131I-TUB-OH or 131I-TUB-OMOM were coupled
per trastuzumab molecule (25). Storage of the ADCs for 5 days
in NaCl at 4 C did not result in release of 131I, while 3% to 4%
release of 131I was observed when ADCs were stored in serum
or NaCl at 37 C for 5 days. No impairment of ADC binding
to target cells was observed under these storage conditions.
Good stability of ADCs was also conﬁrmed in vivo, comparison
of the blood kinetics of 124I-trastuzumab and 131I-TUB-OH–
trastuzumab (Supplementary Fig. S2) showed no signiﬁcant
differences.
The hydrophobicity of a coupled drug, as well as the type,
number, and arrangement of charged groups, can strongly
inﬂuence the physicochemical properties of the mAb, resulting in extended aggregation, altered pharmacokinetics, and
impairment of tumor targeting, even when the in vitro antigen binding of the mAb remains preserved (26–28). For this
reason, conjugation procedures are currently introduced
that give optimal control over the number of drug molecules
coupled to the mAb as well as the mAb sites for drug coupling
(29–31). In our studies, 0, 2, or 4 eq of 131I-TUB-OMOM
on average were directly coupled to the lysine residues of
89
Zr-trastuzumab, avoiding premodiﬁcation of the mAb as
in case of ado-trastuzumab emtansine (12). At 3, 24, 48, and
72 hours after administration of the 131I-TUB-OMOM–89Zrtrastuzumab (2 or 4 eq) conjugates to N87- or JIMT-tumor–
bearing mice, blood levels for 131I were in general not significantly different from 89Zr, conﬁrming stability of the conjugates in blood. What is more, in both tumor models blood
levels as well as tumor uptake of antibody as measured by
89
Zr counting were the same for 131I-TUB-OMOM–89Zr-trastuzumab (2 or 4 eq) and 89Zr-trastuzumab, indicating that
coupling of TUB-OMOM to trastuzumab does not alter the
pharmacokinetics and tumor-targeting properties of trastuzumab (inert coupling).

Cancer Res; 74(20) October 15, 2014

Use of dual-radiolabeled 131I-TUB-OMOM–89Zr-trastuzumab conjugates in vivo led to two other important observations: (i) elevated uptake of 131I in comparison with 89Zr in
colon and ileum content, most probably due to the presence of
free 131I-TUB-OMOM in the injected mice. Indeed, administration of free 131I-TUB-OMOM to tumor-free mice resulted in
rapid blood clearance and predominant accumulation in the
colon and ileum content (Fig. 5), and (ii) elevated uptake of 89Zr
in comparison with 131I in tumors. This is most probably due to
the fact that 131I is released from the tumor after internalization, while 89Zr residualizes inside the cell. As such, diverging
89
Zr and 131I tumor-uptake levels might be indicative for the
level of in vivo ADC internalization (32). At later time points
after injection of 131I-TUB-OMOM–89Zr-trastuzumab, diverging levels of 89Zr and 131I were also observed in normal tissues.
Whether this is the result of intra- and/or extracellular degradation of the ADC is subject of further investigations.
In vivo therapy studies with a single dose of TUB-OMOM–
trastuzumab showed dose-dependent antitumor effects in
established N87 tumor-bearing mice. The highest dose, 60
mg/kg, exhibited the same effect as ado-trastuzumab emtansine (15 mg/kg) and a more pronounced effect than trastuzumab alone. No weight loss or other signs of toxicity occurred.
Complete eradication of N87 tumors was observed with
30 mg/kg TUB-OMOM–trastuzumab (n ¼ 1), 60 mg/kg
TUB-OMOM–trastuzumab (n ¼ 3), and 15 mg/kg ado-trastuzumab emtansine (n ¼ 3). Neither TUB-OMOM–trastuzumab
nor ado-trastuzumab emtansine caused antitumor effects
in mice bearing the JIMT xenograft line, despite the fact that
TUB-OMOM–trastuzumab is targeting JIMT and N87 tumors
equally well (see Fig. 4 and Supplementary Fig. S3). The ADC
is degraded more rapidly in JIMT tumors than in N87
tumors, resulting in release of 131I from the tumor, and this
might be one of the reasons why JIMT tumors show resistance. To get more insight in drug degradation, LC/MS-MS
procedures for tubulysin metabolite analysis in tumors are
currently being developed.
The use of radiolabeling strategies not only has value for the
development and preclinical validation of ADCs as shown
herein, but also might be of help during the clinical development of ADCs. The potential of positron emission tomography
(PET) imaging of 89Zr-labeled antibodies (i.e., 89Zr-immunoPET) in mAb development and applications has been shown
for several mAbs directed against growth factors and membrane receptors (33, 34), the HER2 receptor included (35). 89Zrimmuno-PET can learn about the ideal mAb dosing for optimal
tumor targeting (e.g., saturation of receptors), the uptake in
critical normal tissues to anticipate toxicity, and the interpatient variation in pharmacokinetics and tumor targeting. In
analogy, 89Zr-immuno-PET might be supportive in the clinical
development of tubulysin–antibody conjugates.
In conclusion, herein we show for the ﬁrst time the potential
of tubulysin–antibody conjugates for cancer treatment, thus
opening new avenues in ADC development. Nowadays, fully
synthetic tubulysins can be produced on large scale and with a
broad chemical diversity (5, 6), resulting in higher potency and
chemical stability relative to the natural compounds. Some of
these synthetic tubulysins derivatives are 10 to 100 times more

Radiolabeling Monitored Tubulysin to Trastuzumab Conjugation

potent in vitro than the TUB-OMOM as used in the present
study (unpublished data). Direct coupling of these tubulysin
derivatives to lysine residues of mAbs, via the straightforward
method reported here, might result in ADCs more potent than
TUB-OMOM–trastuzumab and ado-trastuzumab emtansine.
In future strategies for TUB-mAb production, conjugation
efﬁciency can easily be monitored by protein mass spectrometry instead of using radioactivity (36, 37).
