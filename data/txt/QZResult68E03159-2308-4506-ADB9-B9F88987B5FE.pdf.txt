Regulation in Human Prostate Cancer Cells

Abstract
Chemokines play the key role in initiating immune responses by regulating the attraction and homing of
immune cells to the lymphoid and nonlymphoid tissues. CXCL14 is a chemokine that in tumors may act as
chemoattractant for monocytes and dendritic cells (DC), which may modulate antitumor immune responses
in certain cancers. In this study, we investigated the mechanisms of loss of CXCL14 in prostate cancer cells.
Cell treatment with the demethylating agent 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine resulted in the recovery of CXCL14 mRNA
and protein expression. Hypermethylated CpG island sequences encompassing the CXCL14 gene promoter
were identified. The restoration of CXCL14 by 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine treatment had functional impact, based
on the DC chemoattractant activity of conditioned medium from drug-treated cells. Conversely, CXCL14
removal from conditioned media by affinity chromatography abolished its chemotactic properties, confirming
that functionally active CXCL14 was generated in prostate cancer cells by relieving its transcriptional silencing
with 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine. Our findings offer the first direct evidence for epigenetic regulation of chemokine
expression in tumor cells. Cancer Res; 70(11); 4394–401. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Chemokines are the superfamily of proinflammatory
polypeptide signaling molecules that selectively attract and
activate different cell types in lymphoid and nonlymphoid
tissues (1, 2). Chemokines and their receptors are involved
in regulating many pathophysiologic conditions such as
oncogenesis, infection, allergy, and autoimmunity by modulating cellular attraction, proliferation, angiogenesis, as well
as tumor cell growth and spreading (2, 3).
A chemokine, known as CXCL14, was initially named
BRAK because of its isolation from the human breast and
kidney derived cells (4). Constitutive expression of CXCL14
was observed in a variety of epithelia, including the basal keratinocytes and dermal fibroblasts of skin (5). Using quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR), several groups of
investigators independently showed that CXCL14 mRNA
and protein ubiquitously expressed in normal tissues but
are absent in tumor cell lines and in primary tumors (4, 6–9).
The potential biological functions of CXCL14 are still under investigation. To date, it was reported that CXCL14
might play a role in the trafficking of natural killer cells to
the sites of inflammation or malignancy (10). This chemokine

might control the epidermal recruitment of circulating CD14+
dendritic cell (DC) precursors and promote their in situ differentiation into functional DC (11). CXCL14 inhibited angiogenesis stimulated by multiple angiogenic factors (7). Recent
data suggest that CXCL14 chemoattracts both activated
monocytes (12) and immature DC both in vitro and in vivo
(7, 8). In addition to being a potent DC chemoattractant,
CXCL14 also increased DC maturation and their functional
abilities, which were associated with increased activity of
NF-κB (8). The demonstration of a high-affinity binding site
for CXCL14 on immature DC is an important finding, which
opens new opportunities for the identification and characterization of CXCL14 receptor (7).
DC are known as antigen-presenting cells detected in
immature state in virtually every tissue, where they capture
antigens followed by maturation and migration to secondary
lymphoid organs to activate naive antigen-specific T cells.
The capacity of immature DC to migrate into the tumor site
in search for antigens is a key to the successful induction of
the antitumor immune responses (13). Their absence in many
malignant tissues is in agreement with the deficiency of effective antitumor immune responses in cancer patients (14, 15).
The fact that CXCL14, a potent DC chemokine, is downregulated or absent in the malignant tissues suggests that CXCL14
may have a unique role in the tumor recognition by the immune system. Because DC could bind CXCL14 with high affinity (7), migrate to CXCL14-expressing tissues, and be
activated by CXCL14 (7, 8), it was suggested that the downregulation of CXCL14 expression in tumor tissues might represent a new mechanism of tumor evasion, which allows
tumor cells to escape recognition by antigen-presenting
cells (8).
Although, we and others have reported the loss of CXCL14
expression in tumor tissues and tumor cell lines, the

Epigenetic Regulation of Chemokine Expression in Tumor

mechanism of this phenomenon is not clear (6–8). A significant decrease of CXCL14 mRNA in many human tumor cell
lines makes it likely that the suppression of CXCL14 expression occurs at the transcriptional rather than the translational level (4, 6, 8, 9). This transcriptional downregulation
of CXCL14 expression may result from genetic alterations
and/or epigenetic changes (promoter hypermethylation).
Promoter hypermethylation deserves a special attention
because it could silence a variety of tumor suppressor genes
in several malignant neoplasms and was able to decrease
tumor immunogenicity (16–19). The role of the epigenetic
regulation of chemokine expression in tumor cells has not
been yet investigated.
The main goal of the present work was to evaluate the
primary mechanisms of the downregulation of CXCL14
expression in prostate cancer. Our results show that coincubation of CXCL14-negative prostate adenocarcinoma cells
with a demethylating agent results in the restoration of
CXCL14 mRNA and protein expression. Furthermore, demethylation of CpG islands in the promoter region of the
CXCL14 gene in tumor cells restores the expression of functional CXCL14 as seen by the restoration of attraction of
human DC to the tumor cells. These data point toward promoter hypermethylation as a possible mechanism of the
CXCL14 gene suppression in prostate cancer. Using methylation-specific PCR (MSP) and bisulfite-sequencing PCR
(BSP), we found that DNA from prostate cancer cells contains hypermethylated CpG island sequences encompassing
the transcriptional regulatory region of the CXCL14 gene.
Thus, failure to express CXCL14 in tumor cells is a consequence of transcriptional “silencing.” These data are the first
demonstration of the epigenetic regulation of chemokine
expression in tumor cells, which open new opportunities
for pharmacologic regulation of chemokine expression in
the tumor microenvironment.

Materials and Methods
Tumor cell lines and tissues
Prostate cancer cell lines PC-3 and DU145 were obtained
from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and cultured in complete RPMI 1640 supplemented with 2 mmol/L
L -glutamine, 50 μg/mL gentamicin sulfate, 10 mmol/L
HEPES, 10% FCS, and 10 mmol/L nonessential amino acids
(Life Technologies). The PZ-HPV-7 cell line was derived from
normal epithelial cells from the peripheral zone of the
human prostate (ATCC). Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded
tissue sections of normal prostate (n = 7), benign prostatic
hyperplasia (n = 7), and primary prostate adenocarcinoma
(n = 10) were from the Tissue Bank, University of Pittsburgh
Medical Center. In addition, paired malignant glands of
adenocarcinoma and benign prostatic glands were collected from serial frozen sections by needle microdissection
technique. Tissue sections (5-μm) were mounted on siliconcoatedslides, stained with H&E, and reviewed by a pathologist to confirm the presence of tumor and histologically
normal tissue. Then, the areas of carcinoma and benign
tissue were circled and carefully dissected and scraped with

www.aacrjournals.org

a sterile 22-gauge needle. Collected tissues were processed
for RNA isolation and for further analysis.
PC3 and DU145 cells were treated with a demethylating
agent 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine (5-aza-dC; Sigma) to determine
whether DNA methylation influences a gene expression.
Cells were split to low density (1 × 106 cells per T-75 flask)
24 hours before the treatment. Cells were treated with 10 and
25 μmol/L 5-aza-dC for 6 days. CXCL14 protein and mRNA
was determined before and after the treatment by immunocytochemistry and RT-PCR, respectively.
Human DC cultures
Human DC cultures were initiated from CD14+ monocytes
as described earlier (20). Briefly, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were separated using Histopaque
(1.007 g/mL; Sigma) density centrifugation. PBMC were
washed and plated at 1 × 10 7 cells per well in 2 mL of
AIM-V medium (Life Technologies) in six-well plates. After
a 1-hour incubation at 37°C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere, nonadherent cells were removed. Adherent monocytes were cultured with recombinant human granulocyte
macrophage colony-stimulating factor (1,000 U/mL; PeproTech) and human recombinant interleukin-4 (1,000 U/mL;
PeproTech) in complete RPMI 1640 for 6 to 7 days and
immature DC were used in chemotaxis studies.
Chemotaxis assay
DC migration was evaluated using a 48-well Transwell system (5 μm pore size, Corning Costar) with DC placed in the upper chamber (1 × 10 6 cells/mL, 100 μL). Assay medium,
chemokines, or conditioned medium from tumor cell cultures
were added to the bottom chamber (600 μL). Tumor cells were
seeded at 1 × 106 in 4 mL of assay medium. Forty-eight hours
later, cell-free supernatant was collected. The following
groups were used for DC attraction in a bottom chamber: (a)
RPMI 1640 containing 1% fetal bovine serum (FBS; assay medium); (b) assay medium containing 5-aza-dC; (c) assay medium
with 5-aza-dC after passing through the protein A agarose
bound with anti-CXCL14 antibody (Aviva systems; assay media
1, 2, and 3 were used to measure spontaneous DC migration);
(d) recombinant murine DC chemokine MIP-1α (20 ng/mL;
PeproTech), a positive control; (e) cell-free conditioned
media collected from PC3 cells nontreated or ( f ) treated with
25 μmol/L 5-aza-dC; and (g) CXCL14-free conditioned media (filtrate fraction after passing through the agarose A/anti-CXCL14)
collected from PC3 cells treated with 25 μmol/L 5-aza-dC.
Migration of DC was assessed after 4 hours of incubation at
37°C, 5% CO2. After incubation, cells transmigrated thought
the membrane were collected and acquired on FACScan (Becton
Dickinson) for 1 minute for enumeration. Data are reported as
the mean numbers of transmigrated cells from triplicate wells.
Elimination of CXCL14 protein from tumor cell
supernatant by affinity chromatography
To eliminate CXCL14 protein from the culture medium of
PC3 cells treated with 25 μmol/L 5-aza-dC, cell-free culture
supernatant was incubated with anti-CXCL14 antibody
(Aviva systems) overnight at 4°C to form immune complexes.

Immune complexes were added to the protein A agarose
beads, placed to the Pierce spin cup columns (Pierce). The
columns were placed inside of microcentrifuge tubes and
centrifuged for 1 minute at 3,000 g. Filtrate fractions were
collected and used for chemotaxis assay. The same procedure was performed with a medium containing 5-aza-dC to
be used in chemotaxis assay as a negative control.
Immunohistochemistry/immunocytochemistry
Expression of CXCL14 protein in tissue sections and prostrate cancer cells was determined with anti-CXCL14 monoclonal antibodies (10 μg/mL; R&D Systems). Formalin-fixed
and paraffin-embedded tissue blocks were cut into 5-μm
sections, dewaxed, and rehydrated. Tumor cells were cytospinned (100 g, 5 minutes) and air dried. Antigens were
retrieved by boiling in 1 mmol/L EDTA/NaOH solution
(pH 8.0) in a microwave oven. The primary antibodies were
applied for 16 hours followed by 30-minute incubation with
biotinylated secondary horse anti-mouse antibodies (Jackson
ImmunoResearch Laboratories). The color reaction was developed using the avidin-biotin peroxidase technique (Vector
Laboratories, Inc.). Tyramide (1:100; Vector Laboratories,
Inc.) was applied to amplify the intensity of staining. For a
semiquantitative analysis of CXCL14 protein expression, “−”
was graded for no expression, “+”was graded for <2% expression, “++” was graded for 10% to 20%, “+++” was graded for
>20% to 50%, and “++++” was graded for >50% expression.
Reverse transcription-PCR
RNA was extracted from prostate cancer cell lines and normal prostatic epithelium using Trizol LS reagent (Molecular
Research Center) following the supplier's instructions. Firststrand complementary DNA was reverse transcribed with
Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Life
Technologies) and oligo d(T)16 (Roche Applied Science) from
1 μg of total RNA. PCR was performed using specific primers
for CXCL14 (forward, 5′-TCCGGTCAGCATGAGGCTCC-3′,
and reverse, 5′-CACCCTATTCTTCGTAGACC-3′; 313 bp).
PCR cycles involved incubation at 94°C for 2 minutes; then
94°C for 30 seconds, 61°C for 30 seconds, and 72°C for 1 minute
for 40 cycles; and a final extension at 72° for 7 minutes. Primers
for β-actin transcript were used as an internal control (323 bp).
The PCR products were analyzed in 1.2% agarose gel containing ethidium bromide. A DNA ladder II (GeneChoice,
Inc.) was used as a size marker. For quantitation of the levels
of CXCL14 mRNA, the PCR product bands were analyzed using UN-SCAN-IT gel software (Silk Scientific). The bands
corresponding to CXCL14 were quantified by pixel density
using β-actin as a quantitative control. The PCR index was
calculated as sample pixel total/β actin pixel total ratio and
expressed as relative percentage.
Bisulfite modification, MSP, and BSP
The state of the CXCL14 gene promoter methylation in
prostate cancer cells was evaluated by MSP and BSP.
Genomic DNA for deamination, and subsequent MSP and
BSP analysis was extracted from tumor cells using QIAamp
DNA Mini kit (QIAGEN, Inc.). CpGenome universal unmethy-

lated and methylated DNA sets were used as a control for
MSP and BSP (Chemicon International, Inc.). After extraction, 1 μg of DNA from tumor cells and control DNA was
used for bisulfite treatment with the EZ DNA Methylation
kit (Zymo Research) following the supplier's instructions.
MSP was performed to analyze the change in the methylation
status of the 5′ CpG islands of the CXCL14 gene during 5-azadC treatment in prostate cancer cells. MSP primers selective
for unmethylated CXCL14 promoter (forward, 5′-GAGTTTG
TTTGTTGTGAGGGTA-3′, and reverse, 5′-ACCAAAAACCTCATACTAACC-3′; 289 bp) and for methylated CXCL14 promoter (forward, 5′-TTAATGAGTTCGTTCGTTGCGAG-3′,
and reverse, 5′-ACCAAAAACCTCATACTAACC-3′; 294 bp)
were designed. PCR was performed in a reaction mix
containing 500 ng bisulfite-converted genomic DNA. Amplifications were run on the DNA thermal cycler 480 (PerkinElmer), hot started with an initial denaturation step at 95°C
for 7 minutes; the PCR profile were 40 cycles at 95°C for
30 seconds, 62°C to 64°C (depending on Tm values of individual primers) for 30 seconds, and 72°C for 40 seconds; final
extension was performed at 72°C for 7 minutes. PCR products
were loaded on 1.2% agarose gel.
To determine the methylation pattern of 5′CpG islands of
the CXCL14 gene promoter in prostate cancer cells, bisulfitetreated DNA was then subjected to BSP using bisulfitesequencing PCR primers. Primers for bisulfite sequencing
were selected using the Methprimer software program, which
identifies the location and structure of CpG islands. The primers BSP-F (5′-GGTTGGGAAGGTTTTTTTTT-3′) and BSP-R
(5′-ACCCAACTCTACTCRACTTTCT-3′) were used to amplify
CpG islands in the promoter region with the expected product
270 bp in length. Hot-start PCR was carried out for amplifying
the CpG islands of the CXCL14 gene. The PCR product was
purified, sequenced by the ABI 3100 DNA sequencer (Applied
Biosystems), and CpG sites were analyzed for methylation. The
methylation level of each CpG site on CXCL14 was estimated
by comparing the height of the guanidine peak with the height
of the adenine peak on the chromatograms. A single guanidine
peak was considered to represent 100% methylation. In the
partial methylation, the percentage of methylation was
estimated as the ratio of the peak heights of the guanidineto-guanidine plus adenine signals.
Statistical analysis
For a single comparison of two groups, the Student's t test
was used after the evaluation for normality. If data distribution was not normal, a Mann-Whitney rank sum test was
performed. One-way ANOVA was used for the comparison
of more than two groups after the evaluation for normality.
For all statistical analysis, the level of significance was set at
a probability of 0.05 to be considered significant.

chemokine expression when compared with the nonmalignant tissues (Fig. 1A). Figure 1A shows that normal prostate
(n = 7) and benign prostatic hyperplasia tissues (n = 7) are
strongly positive for CXCL14, whereas prostate adenocarcinoma tissues (n = 10) are negative for CXCL14 staining. Comparative analysis of the number of CXCL14+ cells showed that
the level of expression of CXCL14 protein in primary prostate
adenocarcinoma was between 0% and 2%, whereas for normal
prostate tissues, it was 10% to 20%. Finally for benign prostatic
hyperplasia, the level of CXCL14 expression were reached up
to 60%. Next, we evaluated the expression of CXCL14 protein
in PC3 and DU145 human prostate cancer cell lines. Human
PBMC–derived monocytes served as a negative control. Human monocytes stimulated with 0.5 μg/mL lipopolysaccharide (LPS; Sigma) were used as a positive control (6). First,
human PBMC were incubated for 1 hour at 37°C; nonadherent
cells were removed; and adherent monocytes were stimulated
with LPS for 6 hours. We found that PC3 cells were CXCL14
negative, whereas DU145 expressed CXCL14 protein (Fig. 1B).

The analysis of CXCL14 mRNA expression in prostate
cancer cell lines confirmed the downregulation of CXCL14
expression in PC3 cells, whereas normal prostate epithelial
and DU145 cells expressed CXCL14 mRNA (Fig. 1C). The
ratios of CXCL14 to β-actin were 1.02 ± 0.21, 0.38 ± 0.05,
and 0.04 ± 0.02 for normal prostate epithelial, DU145, and
PC3 cells, respectively (Fig. 1C). Prostate cancer cells obtained from primary human tumor specimens (n = 7) by needle microdissection technique showed low or no CXCL14
mRNA expression, whereas adjunct normal prostate cells
expressed markedly higher levels of CXCL14 mRNA (Fig. 1D).
Thus, CXCL14 expression is low or lost in primary prostate
cancer specimens and in some prostate cancer cell lines,
including PC3 cells.
The CXCL14 gene promoter methylation in prostate
cancer cells
Next, we focused on the mechanisms of this phenomenon
and tested whether the expression of CXCL14 in prostate

expression in prostate cancer tissues when compared with the normal adjunct areas.

cancer cells is regulated by the epigenetic mechanisms, i.e.,
hypermethylation. The DNA methylation patterns in the
CpG islands of the CXCL14 gene were determined by MSP
before and after treatment with the demethylating agent
5-aza-dC. First, genomic DNA of PC3 cells nontreated and
treated with 25 μmol/L 5-aza-dC were subjected to bisulfite
modification. Then, using modified DNA, PCR was carried
out to detect unmethylated and methylated DNA by specific
primer sets designed for unmethylated and methylated DNA,
respectively. PCR primers were designed to amplify CXCL14
promoter region with CpG islands. Consequently, CXCL14
promoter methylation was found in PC3 cells: nontreated
PC3 cells displayed the methylated alleles, whereas treatment of tumor cells with 25 μmol/L 5-aza-dC induced the
appearance of the unmethylated alleles of the CXCL14 gene
(Fig. 2A). Universal unmethylated DNA was fully unmethylated, displaying a single band in the MSP corresponding to

unmethylated allele, whereas universal methylated DNA was
fully methylated, respectively (Fig. 2A). In addition, the methylation status of 22 CpG sites in the CpG island covering the
promoter region of the CXCL14 gene was determined by
bisulfite sequencing PCR in PC3 cells. The BSP verified the
reliability of the MSP results. Representative sequencing,
presented in Fig. 2B, shows that most CpG sites are highly
(85–100%) methylated and only 3 (+255, +273, and +277) of
22 CpG sites were methylated at 50% to 75%. Thus, our data
directly show the state of hypermethylation of CpG islands in
the CXCL14 gene promoter region in PC3 cells and its reversibility by demethylating agents.
To confirm that blockage of hypermethylation of CpG
islands in the CXCL14 gene promoter region in PC3 cells
has a biological significance, we next determined whether
5-aza-dC alters the expression of CXCL14 mRNA and protein
in these cells.

Epigenetic Regulation of Chemokine Expression in Tumor

Blockage of hypermethylation with 5-aza-dC restores the
expression of CXCL14 protein and mRNA in PC3 cells
Next, we tested whether 5-aza-dC can change the expression
of CXCL14 at mRNA and protein levels in PC3 cells, and whether it correlates with the status of the CXCL14 gene promoter
methylation. Figure 3A and B show that the treatment of PC3
cells with the demethylating agent 5-aza-dC resulted in the restoration of CXCL14 protein (Fig. 3A) and mRNA (Fig. 3B) levels
in these cells. For example, the ratio of CXCL14 to β actin was
increased from 0.26 ± 0.04 in nontreated tumor cells to 0.95 ±
0.06 in PC3 cells treated with 25 μmol/L 5-aza-dC (Fig. 3B).
Thus, treatment of PC3 cells with 5-aza-dC results in the reappearance of CXCL14 expression in tumor cells. This raises the
next question about the functional significance and activity
of CXCL14 chemokine after the restoration of its expression
in tumor cells by hypermethylation blockage.
5-aza-dC restores the expression of functional CXCL14
in prostate cancer cells
Recently, we and others showed that CXCL14 is a potent DC
chemoattractant in vitro and in vivo (7, 8). Here, we proved that
the restoration of CXCL14 expression in PC3 cells with the demethylating agent 5-aza-dC has the biological significance. We
have determined if control and 5-aza-dC–treated tumor cells
attracted DC and if chemoattraction is due to the production
of CXCL14 chemokine. First, we showed that the conditioned
medium from intact PC3 cell cultures did not attract immature
human DC (Fig. 4). However, attraction of DC was significantly
increased by the supernatants of PC3 cells pretreated with
25 μmol/L of 5-aza-dC. For example, in the presence of cell-free
conditioned media collected from PC3 cells treated with a
demethylating agent, migration of DC reached 1,467 ± 12 versus
941 ± 14 cells per minute transmigrated DC in control wells
(P < 0.05; Fig. 4). Elimination of the CXCL14 protein from the
tumor cell supernatants by affinity chromatography resulted in
the loss of chemoattractive properties of DC toward tumorconditioned media, suggesting that chemoattraction of DC by
5-aza-dC–treated tumor cells was mediated by CXCL14 chemokine (Fig. 4). A comparable chemoattraction of DC (1,405 ±
5 cells/min) was also detected in the presence of known DC
chemoattractant MIP-1α (20 ng/mL) used as a positive control.
Thus, our data revealed that treatment of PC3 cells with
5-aza-dC resulted in the reappearance of functional CXCL14
in tumor cells. Altogether, these results show for the first
time that epigenetic mechanisms are responsible for lowering the expression of CXCL14 chemokine in prostate cancer,
which could be normalized pharmacologically using hypermethylation inhibitors.

Discussion
CXCL14 is a new chemokine with an unknown receptor
that attracts immature DC both in vitro and in vivo. In addition to its chemoattractive properties, CXCL14 is able to
activate DC maturation and function (7, 8). DC are known
to play a key role in initiating antitumor immune responses
(21) and infiltration of tumors by DC is of great importance
for antitumor immunity (15, 22–24).

The presence of DC, macrophages, and lymphocytes in solid tumors is regulated through the local production of chemokines by tumor and stromal cells (1, 8, 25, 26). DCs do not
migrate to the tumors that do not express CXCL14 in vitro
and in vivo (7, 8, 27), suggesting that CXCL14 may have a
special role in host-tumor interaction and tumor recognition
by the immune cells. It is conceivable that DC might be constitutively recruited to the CXCL14-expressing tissues, allowing antigen-presenting cells to leave circulation and enter
these tissues in the absence of inflammation. On the other
hand, the loss of CXCL14 expression in malignant tissues explains the decreased DC infiltration of tumors, thus allowing
the tumor to escape immune control mechanisms.

Figure 4. Demethylating agent 5-aza-dC restores the expression of
functional CXCL14 in PC3 cells. Conditioned media from PC3 cells
nontreated, treated with 25 μmol/L of 5-aza-dC (PC3 + Aza), and treated
with condition medium from PC3 + Aza group after CXCL14 depletion
were tested for their ability to attract DC in migration assay. Removal
of CXCL14 from the medium was performed by binding with specific
anti-CXCL14 antibodies using affinity chromatography. AZA, 5-aza-dC.
As a control for spontaneous migration, the groups used were as follows:
(a) Assay medium (RPMI + 1% FBS), (b) Assay medium + 5-aza-dC,
and (c) Assay medium containing 5-aza-dC after passing through the
protein A agarose bound with anti-CXCL14 antibody. These three control
groups showed the same levels of chemoattractive activity for DC and
were combined together. The results of a representative experiment
are shown; columns, mean; bars, SEM. Three independent experiments
have shown similar results. *, P < 0.05 versus control (t test); #, P < 0.05
versus PC3 + 5-aza-dC (t test).

We showed here that CXCL14 mRNA and protein expression were downregulated in prostate adenocarcinoma tissues
and cells. The loss of CXCL14 mRNA expression in various
tumor tissues and tumor cell lines has been reported (4, 6,
8, 9). It has been also shown that the transduction of tumor
cell lines with the CXCL14 gene resulted in inhibition of tumor growth in vivo (28). Our recent data suggest that the expression of CXCL14 in tumor tissue results in the inhibition
of tumor growth by attracting and activating DC, and inducing the antitumor immune responses.
The mechanisms of regulation of CXCL14 expression in
cancer are not known. Recently, Peterson and colleagues
(29) investigated the posttranslational pathway that may be
involved in the loss of CXCL14 in prostate cancer. The
CXCL14 construct was cloned into adenoviral vector and
transduced into LNCaP prostate cancer cells. Using this approach to create cells overexpressing CXCL14, the authors
reported that CXCL14 protein was not detectable in tumor
cells due to its degradation by ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis. We have recently showed that retroviral transduction of
CXCL14-negative human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cell lines with the CXCL14 gene resulted in the reappearance of the chemokine in tumor cells and increased DC
attraction in vitro as well as significant tumor infiltration by
DC in vivo in chimeric animal models (8). It is possible that
the way of gene delivery determines the expression of transgene and is important for the generation of stable high-titer
producer cell lines and/or protein stability.

The main goal of this work was to evaluate the primary
mechanisms of the downregulation of CXCL14 expression in
nonmodified prostate cancer cells on the transcriptional level.
Among the mechanisms of gene silencing, hypermethylation
of CpG islands located in the promoter regions of tumor suppressor genes has been recognized as being a molecular hallmark of human cancers (16, 30–37). Regulatory genes that are
commonly hypermethylated in malignant cells include the
RB1 gene in retinoblastoma (38); RARβ2, E-caderin, and
RTVP-1 in gastric (39) and prostate cancer (40, 41); and the
p15 gene in leukemias and colorectal cancer (38, 42). However,
it was unknown whether expression of chemokines in tumor
cells may be regulated by the same mechanism. Here, we
examined whether the loss of CXCL14 expression in the PC3
cell line was due to an epigenetic alteration. We showed that
the demethylating reagent 5-aza-dC is effective in inducing
CXCL14 mRNA and protein expression in PC3 cells in a
dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, treatment of PC3 cells
with 5-aza-dC resulted in the restoration of expression of
functional CXCL14 in tumor cells because DC displayed chemoattractive activity toward conditioned media from PC3 cells
treated with 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine, but not from nontreated
tumor cells. To verify that chemoattraction is due to CXCL14,
we showed that the elimination of CXCL14 from tumor cell
supernatant by affinity chromatography resulted in the loss
of DC chemoattraction. These data directly suggest a role of
epigenetic regulation of CXCL14 expression in PC3 cells.
To confirm this finding, we focused on the molecular mechanisms of downregulation of CXCL14 expression in PC3
cells. We speculated that CpG islands in the promoter region
of the CXCL14 gene in tumor cells may be hypermethylated
and we investigated the effect of 5-aza-dC on the demethylation of the CXCL14 promoter region by MSP. Our data revealed that the expression of CXCL14 in PC3 cells is
affected by methylation-induced silencing. The potent inhibitor of DNA methylation, 5-aza-dC, restored the CXCL14 gene
expression in tumor cells. Furthermore, the BSP verified the
reliability of the MSP results. There was a good concordance
between MSP status and bisulfate sequences, limiting the potential detection of false positives by the MSP.
Thus, our results implicate the epigenetic mechanisms extinguishing the CXCL14 gene expression in PC3 cells. Importantly, promoter hypermethylation is a reversible mechanism
of gene silencing and therefore restoration of expression of
lost chemokines in tumor cells may serve as a powerful alternative therapeutic approach to treating different cancers.
