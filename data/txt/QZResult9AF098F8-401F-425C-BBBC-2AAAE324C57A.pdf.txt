BACKGROUND. African Americans (AA) have higher mortality from breast cancer
compared with white Americans (WA). Studies using population-based cancer
registries have attributed this to disparities in treatment after normalizing the AA
and WA populations for differences in disease stage. However, those studies were
hampered by lack of comorbidity data and limited information about systemic
treatments. The objective of the current study was to investigate racial disparities
in breast cancer treatment by conducting a comprehensive medical records
review of women who were diagnosed with breast cancer at the Karmanos Cancer Institute (KCI) in Detroit, Michigan.

METHODS. The study cohort consisted of 651 women who were diagnosed with
primary breast cancer between 1990 and 1996 at KCI. Multivariable logistic
regression analysis controlling for sociodemographic factors, tumor characteristics, comorbidities, and health insurance status was used to assess whether there
were differences between WA and AA in the receipt of breast-conserving surgery
(BCS), radiation, tamoxifen, and chemotherapy.

RESULTS. There was no significant difference between WA and AA in the receipt
of BCS versus mastectomy. Patients with local-stage disease who were enrolled in
government insurance plans underwent mastectomy more often (vs BCS plus
radiation) compared with patients who were enrolled in nongovernment plans.
The rates of receipt of tamoxifen and chemotherapy were similar for local-stage
WA and local-stage AA. However, WA were more likely to receive tamoxifen and/
or chemotherapy for regional-stage disease. Married women with regional disease
were more likely to receive chemotherapy than nonmarried women.

CONCLUSIONS. The results from this study may be used to target educational
interventions to improve the use of adjuvant therapies among AA women who
have regional-stage disease. Cancer 2007;110:2169–77.  2007 American Cancer

reast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed malignancy and
is the second leading cause of cancer mortality among women
in the United States. Mortality from breast cancer is disproportionately higher in African Americans (AA) compared with white Americans (WA).1–6 Several investigators have demonstrated evidence of a
calendar period effect in the racial disparity in breast cancer mortality rates: before the late 1970s, there was little difference in mortality rates between AA and WA.7,8 The calendar period trends reflect
the impact of novel medical interventions, such as screening and
treatments, including access to these interventions. AA individuals
are diagnosed more often at an advanced stage of disease, primarily
because of underutilization of mammographic screening. However,

residual disparities in breast cancer mortality remain
even after adjusting for stage. Another potential explanation is the difference in treatment received by
AA women and WA women. Studies of clinical trials
and equal-access systems have provided support for
the idea that equal treatment will yield similar cancer
outcomes between racial/ethnic minorities and WA
with similar disease.9–13
A few investigators14–18 have reported that breast
cancer treatment differs between AA women and WA
women. However, clear patterns are less discernable
when they are examined with respect to clinical,
sociodemographic, and insurance designations. Stage
of disease alone may not entirely explain disease severity and consequent therapy recommendations. AA
women often present with more aggressive breast
tumors, including a greater proportion of hormone receptor-negative tumors, poorly differentiated tumors,
and high-grade disease.19,20 In addition, AA women
are more likely to have a diagnosis of 1 or more other
comorbid conditions,18,21 contraindicating aggressive
therapy for their breast cancer. These factors influence
physician recommendations for optimal breast cancer
therapy, especially systemic adjuvant therapy. There
also may be differences in the types of treatment
available to AA women compared with WA women
because of structural barriers.22
Previous studies that relied on cancer registry data
from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results
(SEER) Program have suggested the presence of racial
disparity in treatment but were hampered by the lack of
comorbidity data and the limited information about
systemic treatments recorded by hospital-based tumor
registries.23,24 Analyses of SEER data linked to Medicare
claims have delineated treatment use for elderly
women and also have suggested a disparity17; however,
hormone treatments like tamoxifen may be coded
inconsistently in Medicare claims.24 We undertook a
medical records review of women who were diagnosed
with early-stage breast cancer at the Karmanos Cancer
Institute (KCI), an urban comprehensive cancer center
in Detroit that serves a high proportion of poor AA
patients. Medical records were obtained from hospitals,
outpatient clinics, and private physicians’ offices. By
using such comprehensive information, we sought to
investigate racial disparities in the receipt of optimal
breast cancer treatment and to identify the mechanisms that contribute to such disparities.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Population
Eligible women were patients who were diagnosed
with a first primary, invasive breast cancer between

January 1, 1990, and December 31, 1996, who
received their first course of treatment at the Wayne
State University-affiliated Harper University Hospital
(HUH) and KCI. All women in the analysis were residents of the Detroit metropolitan area at the time of
diagnosis, had race classified as AA or WA, and had
hospital billing records available for the assessment
of health insurance status. The Detroit SEER registry
was a source of additional data. For the current analysis, we included women with either local-stage or
regional-stage disease as defined by the SEER Program. Local stage includes invasive carcinoma confined to the breast, and regional stage includes
invasive carcinoma spread beyond the breast, either
by direct extension or to regional lymph nodes.25

Study Variables
Detailed demographic, clinical, pathologic, and treatment information was obtained from the SEER registry,
HUH inpatient medical and billing records, and KCI
outpatient records. Information was obtained on 1)
demographic factors, including age, race, and marital
status; 2) comorbidities; 3) tumor characteristics, including stage at diagnosis, tumor size, number of positive lymph nodes, tumor differentiation, and estrogen
(ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) status; 4) treatment, including breast conserving surgery (BCS) or
mastectomy, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and/or
hormone therapy; and 5) health insurance.
Socioeconomic indicators were determined by geocoding all eligible women based on their SEER-reported
addresses at the time of diagnosis and linking these
addresses to 1990 United States Census data. The geocoding process first assigned a census block group
number based on address to all eligible women. Aggregate socioeconomic status (SES) data specific to each of
the census block groups were obtained from the 1990
US Census of Population and Housing Summary Tape
File 3A. The SES value for each woman in the study
population was computed by using the methodology
described and validated by Krieger et al.26
A chronic illness index was constructed based on
the presence of 5 comorbid conditions abstracted
from patients’ medical charts, with all conditions
given equal weight: 1) body mass index 30 kg/m2,
2) diabetes, 3) hypertension, 4) heart disease, and 5)
stroke. An index score from 0 to 5 was assigned to
each woman and represented the number of comorbid conditions present.
Information on health insurance at the time of
breast cancer diagnosis was obtained from hospital
billing records and was analyzed as a categorical
variable. Nineteen percent of the women were enrolled in a managed care plan at the time of breast

Race and Breast Cancer Treatment/Banerjee et al.

cancer diagnosis, 31% were enrolled in a nonmanaged care plan (eg, fee for service [FFS], commercial
plans), 42% were enrolled in Medicare, 7% were enrolled in Medicaid, and 1% was self-pay. For analytic
purposes, we collapsed managed and nonmanaged
care plans into 1 category (‘‘nongovernment insurance’’). Medicare and Medicaid were combined to
form another category (‘‘government insurance’’).
Data on surgical treatment type, radiation therapy, and systemic therapy were obtained from combining SEER and medical record review data,
counting as ‘‘yes,’’ the presence of any treatment in
either the SEER data or the patients’ charts, with the
exception of tamoxifen, which was obtained only
from patients’ medical records. For analytic purposes, we categorized treatment as primary treatment and adjuvant treatment. Primary treatment was
defined as 1) BCS only, 2) BCS plus radiation, 3)
mastectomy only, and 4) mastectomy plus radiation.
Adjuvant treatment consisted of 1) no systemic therapy, 2) chemotherapy only, 3) tamoxifen only, and 4)
both chemotherapy and tamoxifen.

Statistical Methods
The chi-square test was used to compare the distribution of demographic, socioeconomic, and clinicopathologic variables among AA women and WA
women. The Fisher exact test was used when sparse
cells were encountered in the contingency tables (ie,
expected frequency of any cell <5). Logistic regression was used to assess variations between WA
women and AA women in the type of surgery
received, receipt of radiation with BCS, and receipt
of tamoxifen and chemotherapy after adjusting for
age at diagnosis, marital status, SES, health insurance
status, chronic illness index, tumor size, number of
positive lymph nodes, tumor differentiation, and ER
and PR status. Two-way interactions between variables were tested formally in a logistic regression
model. All analyses were stratified by stage at diagnosis (local and regional). Parameter estimates were
obtained using the maximum-likelihood method of
estimation, and odds ratios (OR) and corresponding
95% confidence limits (95% confidence interval [95%
CI]) were derived based on the model estimates.

RESULTS
In total, 651 patients met the eligibility criteria.
Among the 651 women, we excluded 9 women
because they had a second diagnosis of breast primary within 6 months of the first diagnosis, 3 women
who had histology that was categorized as ‘‘inflammatory carcinoma’’ or ‘‘phyllodes tumor,’’ 2 women
who had no surgery information, and 7 women

women were more likely to be older (P 5 .003), to be
unmarried (P < .0001), to reside in poorer census
block groups (P < .0001), to have government insurance (P < .0001), to have more chronic illnesses (P <
.0001), to have larger tumors (P 5 .01), to have more
poorly differentiated tumors (P 5 .001), and to have
negative ER tumors (P 5 .005) and negative PR
tumors (P 5 .001). Table 2 shows the treatment distribution of these patients by race.
There was no significant difference between WA
and AA women in the receipt of BCS versus mastectomy for local-stage disease (OR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.4–
1.65) or regional-stage disease (OR, 1.65; 95% CI,
0.65–4.16) (Table 3). Furthermore, there was no significant difference between WA and AA women in
the receipt of BCS plus radiation versus mastectomy
alone (ie, without radiation) for the management of
local-stage disease (OR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.29–1.47) or
regional-stage disease (OR, 1.54; 95% CI, 0.56–4.25;
data not shown). Patients with larger tumors (2 cm)
more frequently underwent mastectomy only versus
combined BCS and radiation for local-stage disease
than patients with smaller tumors (OR, 2.5; 95% CI,
1.32–4.76). In addition, patients who were enrolled in
government insurance plans more frequently underwent mastectomy only versus combined BCS and
radiation for local-stage disease than patients who
were enrolled in nongovernment insurance plans
(OR, 2.44; 95% CI, 1.1–5.26).
For local-stage disease, WA women received tamoxifen as frequently as AA women (OR, 0.85; 95%
CI, 0.35–2.07) (Table 4). Older women (ages 50–69
years: OR, 2.55; 95% CI, 1.12–5.79; aged 70 years:

OR, 3.88; 95% CI, 1.23–12.21) and women with positive ER/PR status (OR, 7.92; 95% CI, 3.88–16.18) were
more likely to receive tamoxifen than younger
women and women with negative ER/PR status,
respectively. For regional-stage disease, WA women
received tamoxifen more frequently than AA women
(OR, 4.59; 95% CI, 1.52–13.9). Women aged >70 years
(OR, 5.58; 95% CI, 1.23–25.31), women with larger
tumors (2 cm: OR, 4.17; 95% CI, 1.52–11.41), and
women with positive ER/PR status (OR, 16.28; 95%
CI, 6.68–39.71) received tamoxifen more frequently
than younger women, women with smaller tumors
(<2 cm), and women with ER/PR-negative tumors,
respectively.
Among patients with local-stage disease, WA
women received chemotherapy as frequently as AA
women (OR, 1.3; 95% CI, 0.52–3.26) (Table 5).
Women with positive ER/PR status were less likely to
receive chemotherapy than women with negative
ER/PR status (OR, 0.21; 95% CI, 0.1–0.46). Women
with larger tumors (2 cm) received chemotherapy
more frequently than patients with smaller tumors
(<2 cm; OR, 6.02; 95% CI, 2.79–12.99). Among
patients with regional-stage disease, WA women
received chemotherapy more frequently than AA
women (OR, 3.1; 95% CI, 1.09–8.81). Women with
positive ER/PR status received chemotherapy less
frequently than women with negative ER/PR status
(OR, 0.09; 95% CI, 0.03–0.27). Married women were
more likely to receive chemotherapy than nonmarried women (OR, 2.64; 95% CI, 1.12–6.84).

DISCUSSION
Similar to previous reports,19,20,27,28 in our cancer
center-based population, we observed that AA
women were more likely to have more advancedstage disease, poorly differentiated tumors, and ER/
PR-negative tumors compared with WA. AA women
in our population also more frequently were not
married, resided in poor census block groups, had
government insurance, and had more chronic illnesses. However, when these factors were taken into
account, AA and WA women with local-stage disease
were just as likely to undergo BCS compared with
mastectomy and to receive adjuvant tamoxifen and
chemotherapy. For women with regional-stage breast
cancer, there were differences in treatment between
AA and WA women, with WA women more frequently
receiving tamoxifen and chemotherapy.
Several studies14–18 have indicated that breast
cancer treatment differs between AA and WA women.
However, clear patterns are less discernable when
they are examined with respect to racial, socioeco-

nomic, and insurance designations. Several authors
have indicated that AA women are less likely to
undergo BCS than WA women.14,15 However, racial
differences in treatment often disappear when factors like SES, hospital size, urban residence, health
insurance, and comorbidities are considered.14–16,29
The results from a study of a population similar to
ours17 indicated that AA patients were more likely
than WA patients to have no surgery; yet, among
women who underwent surgery, AA women were
more likely to have BCS than WA women after
adjusting for disease stage at diagnosis, SES, and insurance status. Conversely, a recent study of patients

with breast cancer at 6 New York City hospitals indicated that minority women had twice the risk of failing to receive radiation therapy after BCS, adjuvant
chemotherapy, or hormone therapy.18
Concomitant illnesses frequently influence treatment choice. Several authors have reported that
comorbidities or contraindicating conditions may
lead to deviations from ‘‘standard’’ treatments. For
example, in a study by Yancik et al.,30 certain comorbidities (eg, diabetes requiring insulin, stroke, gastrointestinal tract problems, mental health problems,
and a previous malignancy) in breast cancer patients
were identified as significant predictors of not receiv-

without obvious advanced disease. Patients with
breast cancer who did not receive standard therapy
had a median of 3 concomitant medical illnesses
compared with 1 concomitant illness for patients
who did receive standard therapy.31 More comorbid
conditions were a significant predictor of underuse
of adjuvant breast cancer treatment.18 Along with
others, we also observed21,29 that AA women with
breast cancer are more likely to have comorbidities
than WA women, which emphasizes the need to
adjust for comorbidities to avoid potential confounding of race and comorbidities in assessing treatment

disparities. In our adjusted models, comorbidity did
not have an independent effect on the receipt of either primary or adjuvant treatment for local- or regional-stage disease.
In our population, AA women with regional-stage
breast cancer were less likely to receive adjuvant hormone therapy (tamoxifen) and chemotherapy. Clinical predictors were associated with both of these
outcomes, as expected; for example, positive receptor
status and greater tumor size were associated with
receipt of tamoxifen, and negative receptor status
was associated with nonreceipt of chemotherapy.
However, in our adjusted models, age >70 years pre-

dicted the receipt of tamoxifen among women with
regional-stage cancer, whereas older age predicted
nonreceipt of chemotherapy, and being married
increased the odds of receiving chemotherapy. It is
noteworthy that, in a study by Bickell et al.,18 age
>70 years was not associated with underuse of adjuvant therapy; however, those authors grouped 3
therapies (radiation therapy after BCS, hormone therapy in receptor-positive women, and chemotherapy
in receptor negative-women) as a single outcome.
Perhaps there were competing effects of age associated with hormone and chemotherapy, like what
we observed, leading to a negative association in
their study. There is a lack of consensus on the bene-

fit of chemotherapy in older women,32,33 primarily as
a result of underrepresentation of this age group in
clinical trials, which may have been a factor in our
finding that older age predicted nonreceipt of chemotherapy. Older women more frequently received tamoxifen in our study. One possible explanation for
this finding, is the use of tamoxifen as a sole treatment in elderly women, as reported by others.30
In several studies, a significant association was
observed between marital status and breast cancer
treatment.17,33–38 Marital status acts as a proxy to
social/family support, and it is believed that cancer
patients with good family support have healthier lifestyles before and after treatment, improved time to

diagnosis, and improved treatment decision-making.33,34 Silliman et al.39 reported that married women with early-stage breast cancer were 2.5 times
more likely to receive guideline surgical treatment
versus less than guideline surgical treatment compared with unmarried patients after adjusting
for comorbidity and physical function. Similarly,
Yellen and Cella40 reported that adult cancer patients
who lived with their children were more willing to
undergo aggressive treatments. Blackman et al.38
reported that women with breast cancer who had
poor family support, including unmarried patients
with no living children, were less likely to be prescribed adjuvant tamoxifen for early-stage disease
compared with married patients who had living children. In our study, married women were more likely
than unmarried women to receive adjuvant chemotherapy for regional-stage disease after adjusting for
sociodemographic and tumor characteristics. King
et al.37 reported similar finding, ie, that chemotherapy is associated with a better marital relationship,
suggesting a supportive response from partners. It is
worth noting that our populations of AA and WA
women differed largely in terms of family structure:
Fewer AA patients were married, potentially resulting
in fewer AA patients accepting chemotherapy despite
having more aggressive tumors because of the lack
of a spouse to take care of the family. It should be
recognized, however, that AA patients tend to rely on
the extended family as a social support network.41
Consequently, the importance of marriage to social
support may differ between AA women and WA
women.
The type of health insurance a woman has can
play a role in breast cancer diagnosis and treatment.17,42 It has been reported that the treatment of
early-stage breast cancer in Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs) differs from that of local FFS patterns, although not in a consistent manner.42 Among
elderly patients, it has been reported that the percentage undergoing BCS was similar in HMO and FFS settings,42 although the use of BCS reportedly was slightly
lower among nonelderly patients in HMOs. In a study
of a population similar to ours, women who were
insured by Medicaid had a lower likelihood of receiving radiation therapy than women who were not
insured by Medicaid.17 In our study, patients with
local-stage breast cancer who were enrolled in government insurance plans had a lower likelihood of receiving BCS than patients who were enrolled in
nongovernment plans. Furthermore, patients who
were enrolled in government insurance plans were less
likely to be treated with a combination of BCS and
radiation (as opposed to mastectomy) for local-stage

disease than patients who were enrolled in nongovernment insurance plans. The AA patients in our study
largely were enrolled in government insurance plans
(56%) compared with 39% of WA patients who were
enrolled in government insurance plans at the time
they were diagnosed with breast cancer.
There are a few possible sources of bias that may
influence the generalizability of our findings. First,
single-institution studies like ours have drawbacks
because of selection bias. Our patient population
comprises a large number of older AA women of
lower SES with a high incidence of diabetes and obesity. However, it is precisely this patient distribution,
together with the large size of our patient cohort, the
availability of detailed information regarding demographics, socioeconomic variables, tumor cell characteristics, and chronic illnesses, and especially the
treatment information, that allowed us to study a
potentially important phenomenon. Second, all of
the women who were analyzed in our study had
health insurance (ie, they had some access to care)
at the time of diagnosis. Thus, we were unable to
assess whether differences in access to care among
AA and WA women partly may explain treatment disparity. Third, we were unable to measure patient preferences and physician attitudes toward treatment
decisions for breast cancer because of the lack of
such data in patients’ charts.
In summary, in an urban comprehensive cancer
center environment, we found that AA and WA
women received similar therapies for local stage cancer. Younger AA women with regional stage cancer
were less likely than WA to receive hormone therapy.
Older, unmarried AA women were less likely than WA
women to receive chemotherapy. This information
may be used to target educational interventions to
improve the use of adjuvant therapies among AA
women with regional stage disease. Strategies that
provide increased social and psychological support,
both initially, when a decision is being made about
choice of therapy, and subsequently, when therapy is
administered, may be expected to provide a greater
benefit to unmarried individuals.
