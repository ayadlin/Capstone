ABSTRACT
Background: Patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) harboring
wild-type KRAS benefit from epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-targeted
therapy. However, patients who are treated with anti-EGFR antibodies will eventually
develop the resistance to those agents. HER2 amplification is one of the mechanisms
conferring resistance to anti-EGFR antibody therapy and could therefore be a
potential therapeutic target. The aim of this study was to detect HER2 amplification
in circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) from patients with CRC and acquired resistance to
anti-EGFR antibody therapy
Results: Our data showed that 22% (4/18) of patients in the cohort exhibited
HER2 amplification. One of these patients was found to be positive for HER2
amplification in matched tumor specimens collected after cetuximab therapy, at which
point the patient had acquired cetuximab resistance, despite being negative for HER2
amplification prior to therapy.
Methods: We analyzed plasma ctDNA using digital polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) from 18 patients with CRC, who had been treated with anti-EGFR antibody-based
therapy (cetuximab) and subsequently acquired resistant cetuximab. HER2 gene copy
number was analyzed using fluorescence in situ hybridization in tumor samples before
and after acquisition of resistance to cetuximab-based therapy.
Conclusion: Analysis of plasma ctDNA by digital PCR could be useful for detecting
HER2 amplification in patients with CRC who were resistant to anti-EGFR antibody
therapy.

cancer and contributes cancer cell proliferation,
metastasis, and angiogenesis [3]. Anti-EGFR antibody
therapies, including cetuximab and panitumumab, have
improved the prognosis of patients with CRC, particularly
in patients with the wild-type KRAS gene, in which these
agents exhibit enhanced efficacy [4–7]. KRAS functions
downstream of EGFR, and its spontaneous activation
due to mutation promotes cell proliferation despite the
presence of anti-EGFR antibody [8].

INTRODUCTION
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common
cancer in the world. Advances in systemic chemotherapies
have led to significant improvements in survival for
patients with metastatic CRC [1, 2]. Indeed, recent
research efforts have focused on the development of
agents targeting the epidermal growth factor receptor
(EGFR), which is frequently overexpressed in colorectal

However, the clinical efficacy of anti-EGFR
antibody therapy is eventually limited by the development
of acquired resistance. Several mechanisms for acquired
resistance to anti-EGFR antibody therapy have been
identified in CRC. For example, KRAS and NRAS
genomic alternations may evolve under anti-EGFR
antibody therapy, resulting in resistance to these therapies
[9][10]. Alternatively, EGFR ectodomain mutations,
such as S492R, have been shown to prevent anti-EGFR
antibodies, particularly cetuximab, from binding with
EGFR, thereby conferring resistance to this therapy [11].
Furthermore, our previous studies have shown that HER2
genomic amplification causes resistance to cetuximab in a
preclinical model and in clinical samples [12]. Specifically,
HER2 amplification was shown to evolve in non-small cell
lung cancer (NSCLC) and CRC cell lines after prolonged
exposure to cetuximab. Moreover, HER2 signaling
bypasses cell proliferation signals derived from EGFR
under EGFR inhibition with cetuximab. Notably, HER2
genomic amplification was shown to evolve in CRC tumors
also after acquisition of resistance to cetuximab, despite the
absence of HER2 amplification prior to cetuximab therapy.
This resistance could be overcome using HER2 inhibitors,
such as trastuzumab and lapatinib.
Repeated sampling of tumors is helpful to
determine how tumors develop resistance after systemic
therapy. However, this approach has limitations
because of the invasiveness of biopsy procedures
and tissue heterogeneity. Circulating tumor DNA
(ctDNA) originating from tumor cells may reflect
the pathological condition of the original tumor [13].
ctDNA can be obtained less invasively than tumor
biopsies and can provide information regarding
systematic tumor characteristics. Therefore, ctDNA
may be useful for diagnosing how cancer cells acquire
resistance. For example, a previous study detected the
development of KRAS mutations in ctDNA from some
patients with CRC who had been treated with antiEGFR antibody therapy [14]. Therefore, it is possible
that HER2 amplification may be detected in ctDNA
from patients with CRC who have developed resistance
to anti-EGFR antibody therapy. HER2 genomic
amplification is rare in CRC [15], but is more frequent
in patients with breast cancer [16] and can be detected
in ctDNA [17].
In this study, we aimed to detect HER2 amplification
in ctDNA from patients with CRC who acquired resistance
to anti-EGFR antibody therapy.

The patients’ baseline characteristics, including age, sex,
primary tumor site, drug regimen, best overall response,
and progression-free survival (PFS), are summarized in
Table 1. All patients had tumors with wild-type KRAS;
had been treated with fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin,
irinotecan, and bevacizumab; and were refractory to
those agents prior to cetuximab-based therapy. Eight
patients achieved partial response, and 10 patients had
durable tumor stabilization for more than 10 weeks
following initiation of cetuximab-based therapy. All
patients continued cetuximab-based therapy until tumor
progression (maximum duration: 784 days). Median
PFS was 182.5 days, and four patients had no tumor
progression for more than 1 year.

Relative HER2 copy number ratio in ctDNA
Relative HER2 copy number ratios varied among
all samples and are summarized in Table 2 (n = 18;
median: 1.09; range: 0.94–5.18). The cut-off value for
the relative HER2 copy number ratio in plasma samples
was set at 1.25, as described previously [17]. Samples
from four patients (22%, patient numbers 5, 10, 14, and
17) were classified as HER2-positive cases. Among
these four HER2-positive patients, three achieved
partial response and had durable PFS longer than 5
months before plasma was obtained. Additionally, we
evaluated the extracellular domain of HER2 in serum
using chemiluminescent immunoassays [12]. The
expression level of the extracellular domain of HER2
varied among these patients (n = 16; median: 11.4 ng/
mL; range: 5.2–17.9 ng/mL). One patient (#10) with
HER2 copy number amplification had the highest
concentration of the extracellular domain of HER2
among all patients. However, there was no significant
correlation between relative HER2 copy number ratios
in ctDNA and the concentration of the extracellular
domain of HER2.

HER2 genomic amplification in tumors after
acquisition of resistance to cetuximab-based
therapy
To examine the concordance of HER2 amplification
between plasma ctDNA and tissue samples, we rebiopsied
the metastatic lesion in patient #5 after acquisition of
resistance to cetuximab therapy. HER2 expression levels
were evaluated with immunohistochemistry (IHC),
and HER2 genomic copy numbers were measured by
fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) in tumors. IHC
showed evidence of HER2 overexpression, scoring 2+
according to the diagnostic criteria for colorectal cancer
[18], this feature was detected in the tumor obtained after
acquisition of cetuximab resistance. In contrast, HER2
was not expressed in the primary lesion prior to cetuximab
therapy (Figure 1). According to the diagnostic criteria

with CRC who were resistant to anti-EGFR antibody
therapy. Importantly, they also identified genomic
alterations, including KRAS, NRAS, MET, FLT3, EGFR,
and MAP2K1, in plasma ctDNA from those patients
[20]. Taken together, these data suggest ctDNA may
provide an exhaustive genomic explanation, including
HER2 amplification, for anti-EGFR antibody resistance
in CRC.
Previous studies have reported the HER2
amplification frequency ranges from 3% to 5.8% at
the time of CRC diagnosis [15][21]. However, in the
current study, four patients (22%) were classified as
positive for plasma HER2 DNA. This discrepancy
regarding the frequency of HER2 amplification may be
explained by the limited samples size in this study or
the clonal evolution of HER2 after anti-EGFR antibody
treatment. Other studies have reported the emergence
of mutant KRAS alleles or MET amplification following
anti-EGFR antibody therapy in patients with CRC
[9][22]. However, in the current study, we could not
evaluate HER2 amplification in plasma ctDNA in a
time-dependent manner. Moreover, for patient #5,

DISCUSSION
In the current study, we detected HER2 amplification
in plasma ctDNA from patients with cetuximab-resistant
CRC. Moreover, we found that one patient with
plasma HER2 copy number elevation exhibited HER2
amplification in the tumor after acquisition of resistance
to cetuximab. These results suggested that ctDNA could
potentially provide information regarding the effects of
HER2 amplification on resistance to cetuximab in patients
with CRC.
Several types of acquired resistance mechanisms
for anti-EGFR antibody therapy have been described
[19], and some related genomic alterations can be
detected in ctDNA [9][14]. Consistent with our current
study, Siravegna et al reported that HER2 amplification
could be detected in plasma ctDNA from patients

tumor samples did not exhibit HER2 amplification
at the time of diagnosis, despite the appearance of
HER2 amplification in both the tumor and plasma after
acquisition of resistance to cetuximab. In the current
study, some patients with HER2 amplification in
ctDNA could not undergo rebiopsy after acquisition of
cetuximab resistance. Generally, patients with advanced
colorectal cancer refuse to undergo additional biopsies
because of the invasiveness of the method and the lack
of substantial benefits. In contrast to rebiopsy, analysis
of ctDNA could facilitate decisions regarding optimal
treatment strategies in a less invasive manner.
There were no significant correlations between
relative HER2 copy number ratios in ctDNA and the
concentration of the extracellular domain of HER2. In
particular, patient #5 exhibited HER2 amplification in
plasma and in the tumor after cetuximab treatment, despite
the reduced HER2 ECD level. The extracellular domain
of HER2 is shed by protease-like ADAM10 in cancer
cells. Alternatively, HER2 ECD could be metabolized
systemically. These additional factors may affect HER2

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

ECD levels; therefore, HER2 ECD levels are not
correlated with HER2 amplification in ctCDA.
Patients with HER2 amplification were resistant
to anti-EGFR antibody therapy, but may benefit from
other treatment strategies. Preclinical studies have
shown that HER2-targeting therapy, including lapatinib
or trastuzumab, can overcome cetuximab resistance in
NSCLC and CRC cells with HER2 amplification [12].
Furthermore, Siena et al reported that trastuzumab
and lapatinib combination therapy induced a partial
response in seven of 22 patients (32%) with HER2positive CRC who were resistant to anti-EGFR antibody
therapy [24]. Additionally, Deeken et al reported that
the combination of cetuximab and lapatinib provided
a partial response in some patients with CRC who
were resistant to anti-EGFR antibody therapy [25].
Therefore, these data suggest that evaluation of HER2
in ctDNA may be helpful for determining the optimal
therapy involving HER2-targeting combination therapy
rather than anti-EGFR antibodies alone in patients with
CRC.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Assessment of HER2 extracellular domain
concentrations

Study patients

Plasma was obtained from 16 patients with
CRC after the acquisition of resistance to cetuximab.
The HER2 extracellular domain was measured with
a chemiluminescent immunoassay according to the
manufacturer’s recommendations (Siemens Healthcare
Diagnostics).

Plasma samples were obtained from 18 patients
with histologically confirmed metastatic CRC who were
treated with cetuximab-based therapy at Kinki University
Hospital between November 2008 and October 2011.
RESIST version 1.1 was used to assess best overall
response. Written, informed consent was obtained from
all participants. The study protocols were approved by the
ethics committee of Kinki University Hospital.

ctDNA extraction
Plasma ctDNA was purified using a QIAamp
Circulating Nucleic Acid Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA).
HER2 copy number was measured using the QX100
Droplet Digital PCR System in accordance with the
manufacturer’s instructions (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA,
USA).The relative HER2 copy number ratio was
calculated relative to the control EFTUD2 gene, as
previously described [17]. For HER2 copy number assays,
the primer sequences were as follows: HER2 forward,
5′-ACAACCAAGTGAGGCAGGTC-3′; HER2 reverse,
5′-GTATTGTTCAGCGGGTCTCC-3′; HER2 probe,
5′-/56-FAM/AGGCACCCA/ZEN/GCTCTTTGAGG
ACAAC/3IABkFQ/-3′; EFTUD2 forward, 5′-GGTCTTG
CCAGACACCAAAG-3′; EFTUD2 reverse, 5′-TGAGAG
GACACACGCAAAAC-3′; EFTUD2 probe, 5′-/5HEX/
TCCAGGTAG/ZEN/GACATCCTTTGGCTTT/3IAB
kFQ/-3′. PCR was performed using the following
cycling conditions: 95°C for 10 min, 40 cycles of
94°C for 30 s, and 58°C for 90 s, followed by enzyme
deactivation at 98°C for 10 min. After thermal cycling,
the plates were transferred to a Droplet reader. We
aimed to obtain at least 100 droplets for HER2 and
EFTUD2 to accurately assess the ratio. Digital PCR data
were analyzed using the QuantaSoft analytical software
package (Bio-Rad). The copy number of each gene
(HER2 and EFTUD2) was estimated from the Poisson
distribution. HER2 amplification with digital PCR was
defined as a HER2 ratio (HER2/EFTUD2 copy number
ratio) of 1.25 [17].

FISH analyses
Cell suspensions were dropped onto precleaned slides
and air-dried. Three-day-old slides were analyzed using the
dual-color FISH assay with the PathVysion DNA probe
set. The slides were incubated in 70% acetic acid for 40 s,
digested in 0.008% pepsin/0.01 M HC1 at 37°C for 5 min,
fixed in 1% formaldehyde for 10 min, and dehydrated in an
ethanol series. Formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded (FFPE)
tissue sections from patients with CRC were subjected to
dual-color FISH using the PathVysion probe (LSI HER2
SO/CEP17 SG, Abbott Molecular). Initially, the slides were
incubated from 2 h to overnight at 56°C, deparaffinized in
Citri-Solv, and washed in 100% ethanol for 10 min. The
slides were sequentially incubated in 2× SSC at 75°C for
10–24 min, digested in 0.25 mg/m: proteinase K/2× SSC
at 45°C for 10–24 min, washed in 2× SSC for 5 min, and
dehydrated in ethanol. The probe was applied according to
the manufacturer’s instructions to the selected hybridization
area, which was covered with a glass coverslip and sealed
with rubber cement. DNA denaturation was performed for
15 min at 85°C, and hybridization was allowed to occur at
37°C for 12–24 h. Post-hybridization washes were performed
sequentially with 2× SSC/0.3% NP40 (pH 7.0–7.5) at
73°C for 2 min and 2× SSC for 2 min, and samples were
dehydrated in ethanol. Chromatin was counterstained with
DAPI (0.3 μg/mL) in Vectashield mounting medium (Vector
Laboratories). Analysis was performed on an epifluorescence
microscope using single interference filters sets for green
(FITC), red (Texas red), blue (DAPI), dual (red/green), and
triple (blue, red, and green) band-pass filters.

CONFLICTS OF INTEREST
No conflicts of interest were disclosed.

IHC assessment of HER2 expression

GRANT SUPPORT

Sections of archived formalin-fixed, paraffinembedded tissue (4 μm thick) were placed on slides coated
with polylysine. After deparaffinization and blocking of
endogenous peroxidase, HER2 immunostaining was
performed using rabbit anti-human c-erbB-2 as a primary
antibody (Dako Corp, Carpinteria, CA, USA) at a 1:100
dilution. Primary antibody binding was assessed using the
Dako Quick-Staining, Labeled Streptavidin-Biotin System
(Dako) and followed by the addition of diaminobenzidine
as a chromogen.
