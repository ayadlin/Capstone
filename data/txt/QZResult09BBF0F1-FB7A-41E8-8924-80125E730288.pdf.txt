Abstract
The phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway is very commonly activated in a wide range of human
cancers and is a major driving force in oncogenesis. One of the class I lipid kinase members of the PI3K family,
p110α, is probably the most commonly mutated kinase in the human genome. Alongside genetic, molecular
biological, and biochemical studies, chemical inhibitors have been extremely helpful tools in understanding
the role of PI3K enzymes in signal transduction and downstream physiological and pathological processes,
and also in validating PI3Ks as therapeutic targets. Although they have been valuable in the past, the early
and still frequently employed inhibitors, wortmannin and LY294002, have significant limitations as chemical
tools. Here, we discuss the case history of the discovery and properties of an increasingly used chemical probe,
the pan-class I PI3K and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor PI-103 (a pyridofuropyrimidine),
and its very recent evolution into the thienopyrimidine drug GDC-0941, which exhibits excellent oral anticancer activity in preclinical models and is now undergoing phase I clinical trials in cancer patients. We
also illustrate the impact of structural biology on the design of PI3K inhibitors and on the interpretation
of their effects. The challenges and outlook for drugging the PI3 kinome are discussed in the more general
context of the role of structural biology and chemical biology in innovative drug discovery. Cancer Res; 70(6);

Introduction: Points of Activation and
Intervention
Phosphatidylinositide 3-kinases (PI3K) are critical elements in a signal transduction pathway that plays a key role
in regulating many features of cell behavior, including
growth, survival, metabolism, and various specialized functions. They belong to a family of lipid kinases that phosphorylate the 3′-hydroxy position of the inositol ring of
phosphatidylinositides, yielding products of which the best
characterized is phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate
(PIP3), the second messenger that recruits protein kinase B
(AKT) to the cell membrane (1, 2). PIP3 is generated by the
class I PI3Ks, which comprise p110α, p110β, and p110δ (class
IA) and p110γ (class 1B), proteins that are activated to varying extents by receptor tyrosine kinases and G-protein coupled receptors. In addition to the class I PI3Ks, of note in the

present context are the class II and III lipid kinases and also
the class IV PI3K-related protein kinases (PIKK), including
mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), which is downstream on the PI3K pathway, and DNA-PK, ATM, and ATR,
which are pivotal in DNA repair (1, 3).
In terms of its importance in cancer, the PI3K signaling
cascade is more appropriately referred to as a super-highway
than a pathway. It is hijacked in multiple ways in many types
of human malignancy (4, 5). PIK3CA, which encodes the
p110α catalytic subunit of PI3K, is probably the most commonly mutated kinase in the human genome (15% of all cancers) and is also amplified in some tumors, whereas PTEN,
which encodes the opposing phosphatase to PI3K, is the second most commonly affected tumor suppressor gene after
p53 (6, 7).4 Activation of PI3K signaling in cancer also occurs
at the level of mutated or overexpressed receptor tyrosine
kinases, AKT and RAS (4, 5). The frequent genetic and epigenetic activation by a range of different molecular mechanisms strongly suggests that activation of the PI3K pathway
is very likely to be a critical step in human oncogenesis.
The overwhelming degree of genetic validation for PI3K
signaling as a therapeutic target in cancer is supported by
multiple lines of functional credentialing, including genetically engineered mouse models (5, 8).
The optimal point of therapeutic intervention in the PI3K
pathway remains unclear and will likely depend on the
particular molecular pathology driving a given cancer
(4, 5). Furthermore, emerging evidence shows that various

abnormalities in the pathway can have different effects
(4, 5). Nevertheless, all class I PI3Ks are compelling targets
for therapeutic intervention because p110α is mutated and
amplified in cancer and all four isoforms can generate PIP3
and are oncogenic in model systems (9). On the other hand,
recent data indicate that the preferred class I PI3K target
may be dependent on the molecular context, for example,
mutation of p110α, loss of PTEN, or overexpression of
p110α, p110β, or p110δ; thus fueling the ongoing debate
on the optimal selectivity profile of PI3K drugs for cancer
treatment (5, 9). This important issue of selectivity, upon
which PI3K inhibitors are shedding invaluable light, is
discussed further below.

monly found in PI3K inhibitors, the most frequent is the aryl
morpholine present in LY294002 (Fig. 1). The oxygen atom of
the morpholine moiety forms a key hydrogen bond interaction with the hinge region of the kinase, as well as making
additional hydrophobic interactions in the ATP pocket (ref.
26 and see later). In addition to inhibitors based on wortmannin and LY294002, high-throughput screening (HTS) of
large diverse compound collections coupled to medicinal
chemistry efforts, frequently supported by structural biology
studies, has led to more than 15 chemical classes of PI3K
inhibitors (13, 22–25) and has considerably enriched the
available chemical equity.

The Emergence of Chemical Tools

The Discovery of PI-103: An Improved
Chemical Tool

Following on from the success with protein kinase inhibitors in cancer treatment (10) and in the general context of
“drugging the cancer genome” (11), the subsequent therapeutic targeting of PI3K enzymes has been termed “drugging the
PI3 kinome” (12).
Alongside genetic, molecular biological, and biochemical
studies, chemical inhibitors have been enormously valuable
as tools in PI3K research (13–16). They have been used to help
understand the role of PI3K enzymes in signal transduction
and downstream physiological and pathological processes,
as well as to assist validation of PI3Ks preclinically as therapeutic targets (13). The earliest and still widely employed inhibitors were wortmannin and LY294002 (Fig. 1). Wortmannin
is a fungal natural product originally identified in 1987 as a
potent inhibitor of the respiratory burst in neutrophils and
monocytes (17). It was subsequently found to inhibit PI3K
(18) by covalent attack on the ATP site Lys 802 (human
p110α numbering; ref. 19). The synthetic flavone LY294002,
based on the natural product, broad spectrum protein kinase
inhibitor quercetin, was first reported as an inhibitor of PI3K
in 1994 (20), at a time when relatively few selective inhibitors
of any kinase had been discovered (21). Although these two
agents have been extremely useful and are still widely employed as research probes (e.g., refs. 13–15), they both have
very significant limitations. Wortmannin is a reactive electrophilic and therefore unstable compound whereas LY294002 is
a weak inhibitor with only micromolar potency, and both
agents display significant off-target effects on other kinases
(9–13, 15). Because of those properties, they are not ideal as
probes for specific PI3Ks. Nevertheless, important proof of
concept studies with these chemical tools and their analogs
in animal models, together with the emerging biology of PI3Ks
and their role in a range of disease pathologies, including not
only cancer but also inflammation, autoimmune, and cardiovascular disease, has led to an explosion of interest in the discovery of PI3K inhibitors (reviewed in refs. 9, 18–21).
Early drug discovery efforts used wortmannin and
LY294002 as chemical starting points for inhibitor design
and sought to overcome their respective drawbacks in potency, selectivity, and pharmaceutical properties (22–25). The inspiration that these early inhibitors provided is reflected in
the fact that among the privileged chemical scaffolds com-

In 2006 to 2007, Hayakawa and colleagues published a series of four articles (27–30) that described the use of HTS,
based on a scintillation proximity assay, to discover a range
of chemically interesting PI3K hits with micromolar inhibitory potency, which were then optimized in the same work by
medicinal chemistry to yield single digit nanomolar leads
(Fig. 2). One of those lead compounds was the pyridofuropyrimidine PI-103 (Figs. 1 and 2; ref. 29), which in the initial and
later work was shown to exhibit IC50 values of 2 to 3 nM (at
1 μM ATP) on the class IA α, β, and δ isoforms of p110 PI3K
and a slightly higher though still very potent IC50 of 15 nM
on the class IB isoform p110γ (29, 31–33). Antitumor activity
was initially reported against four human cancer cell lines
in vitro and also against HeLa human cervical cancer xenografts in athymic mice (29).
Following the publication of the design, synthesis, and
structure-activity relationships for PI-103 (29), the same collaborative team provided a detailed pharmacological characterization and mechanistic evaluation of the new agent (33).
PI-103 exhibited advantages over wortmannin and LY294002,
with excellent potency and selectivity for class I PI3Ks versus
a panel of 70 other kinases, including class II and III PI3Ks
and numerous representative protein kinases, as well as having improved stability. However, it was recognized that this
agent still had some liabilities with respect to its use in animal models, specifically limited aqueous solubility and extensive metabolism (33). Nevertheless, the compound gave
sufficient pharmacokinetic exposure in plasma and tumor
tissue of treated mice to allow the demonstration of proof
of concept for therapeutic activity against eight human tumor xenograft models representing various cancer types, including several with PI3KCA mutations and mutated or
silenced PTEN, which are thus more likely to be “addicted”
to the PI3K pathway (33). PI-103 showed evidence of effects
on invasion, angiogenesis, and metastasis, as well as direct
antiproliferative activity, mainly resulting from a G1 arrest
and involving reduced expression of cyclin D1 and increased
p27 (33, 34).
The antitumor activity of PI-103 was associated with effects on pharmacodynamic biomarkers, which were fully
consistent with the therapeutic mechanism being PI3K inhibition, including reduced phosphorylation of AKT and other

pathway substrates; PI-103 also induced a gene expression
profile consistent with PI3K pathway modulation (33, 34).
PI-103 was included, along with a diverse array of other
cell permeable, relatively drug-like PI3K inhibitors selected
from the patent literature, in an innovative chemical biology
study that revealed fascinating cryptic homologies across
PI3K targets and chemotypes and showed clear trends in
selectivity across the class I PI3K and PIKKs that were

not predictable from the amino acid sequence (35). In
one important exemplification of the approach, a matrix
of PI3K-inhibitory chemical tools, including PI-103 and other, more p110α-specific inhibitors, was used to identify
p110α as the critical PI3K acting downstream of the insulin
receptor (35), a result that was consistent with the mouse
knock-in studies (36). These findings emphasized the concern at that time that p110α-specific PI3K inhibitors could

potentially cause insulin resistance and associated diabetogenic side-effects.
A PubMed search5 revealed that since its initial discovery
(29, 31–33), PI-103 has been employed as a chemical tool in
at least 30 published studies. In one of the earliest of these
(37), PI-103 was shown to have potent activity against human
glioma models, also seen in other reports (31–34). Through
comparison with a small array of PI3K inhibitors with differing PI3K and PIKK selectivities, this was linked to the com-

binatorial inhibition of p110α and mTOR by PI-103 (37). Indeed the gene expression profile induced by PI-103 in glioma
cells shared common elements with changes caused by the
mTOR inhibitor rapamycin, amino acid deprivation, and
modulation of insulin/IGFR signaling (34). However, this
combinatorial effect may not, in fact, be essential for antitumor activity and we will return later to the requirement for
mTOR inhibition.

of selectivity patterns of kinase inhibitors, revealed by profiling large, diverse kinase panels representative of the broader
kinome, the suitability of these agents as chemical tools for

use in cellular studies was determined. On the basis of this
comparative assessment, the replacement of LY294002 by
PI-103 was recommended alongside wortmannin as the two
most suitable chemical probes to be used in tandem to determine the involvement of PI3K signaling in cellular phenotypes.
Despite its value as a chemical tool (16, 35) and its utility
in showing the therapeutic potential of this series of PI3K
inhibitors (33, 34, 37), PI-103 was recognized from the outset
to exhibit serious drawbacks in terms of its drug-like properties and thus its suitability for clinical development (33). In
particular, the planar tricyclic structure (Fig. 3) results in
limited aqueous solubility, and the phenolic hydroxyl group
is rapidly glucuronidated. These adverse features needed to
be fixed in order to produce a clinical development candidate
with suitable formulation and pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties, while retaining potency and selectivity
against PI3K.

potency against p110β and p110δ was lower by an order of
magnitude, these compounds are still potent pan-class I inhibitors (38, 39). Submicromolar antiproliferative activity was
maintained against a panel of cancer cell lines, consistent
with comparable inhibition of AKT phosphorylation to that
seen with PI-103 (39). PI-540 and PI-620 exhibited much
improved aqueous solubility and reduced in vitro microsomal

From PI-103 to GDC-0941: A Candidate for
Clinical Development
Designing a drug candidate suitable for clinical evaluation
is like solving Rubik's cube in that all of the essential elements need to be aligned simultaneously in the same molecule. Almost inevitably the eventual clinical agent is to some
degree a compromise, because many of the different properties may be dependent on the same structural features within
the drug molecule. Solubility and pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic behavior are very important alongside target
potency and selectivity (10). This is as true for PI3K inhibitors as it is for other drugs.
The multiparameter lead optimization program focused
on improving pharmaceutical, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic properties while maintaining the key inhibitory activity on class I PI3K enzymes and the related
antiproliferative activity against cancer cells (38, 39). The
two chemical starting points considered were: 1) the tricylic
pyridofuropyrimidine PI-103 (29); and 2) the bicyclic thienopyrimidine “compound 1,” also optimized from an HTS hit
(Figs. 1 and 2; ref. 27). The latter, although it exhibited even
faster clearance than PI-103 in mice, offered greater potential
for optimization because of its lower molecular weight and
capacity for key chemical substitutions to be made. From
among the large number of chemical analogs designed, synthesized, and tested in an iterative fashion (38), the more advanced lead compounds PI-520 and PI-620 illustrate the
evolution to the clinical candidate GDC-0941 (Fig. 1; ref. 39).
Both PI-540 and PI-620 are bicyclic thienopyrimidines
(Fig. 1) with a solubilizing piperazine-based functionality at
the 6-position of the thienopyrimidine ring (left-hand side),
which was predicted by computer modeling to extend out
of the ATP-pocket into the solvent. This modeling was done
using PI-103, the bicyclic thienopyrimidine lead, and the
p110γ structure (38). At the same time, PI-540 and PI-620
keep the phenol moiety (right-hand side) that was thought
to be required for binding in the affinity pocket (refs. 35,
38, and see later). PI-540 and PI-620 retained the ≤10-nM potency against p110α and p110δ seen with PI-103; although

metabolism. Clearance was still quite fast, owing to remaining glucuronidation of the phenolic hydroxyl and extensive
tissue uptake, but high tissue-to-plasma ratios led to improved concentrations and better PI3K pathway modulation
in human tumor xenografts and resulted in correspondingly
greater antitumor activity, as compared with PI-103 (39). Indazoles were investigated as phenol replacements that might
markedly reduce glucuronidation while maintaining the
necessary target interaction, specifically the hydrogen bond
donor properties in the affinity pocket of the ATP site (see
later). This strategy paid off and GDC-0941 was designed
(38) by combining: 1) a 4-indazole substitution on the
right-hand side of the thienopyrimidine ring; with 2) an optimized sulfonylpiperazine solubilizing group on the lefthand side; while at the same time 3) retaining the essential
morpholine (top of structure; Fig. 1).
Solving the Rubik's cube conundrum in this way resulted
in a range of interesting and attractive features being exhibited by GDC-0941 (38, 39). The drug retains the 3 nM IC50
against wild-type p110α and has equal potency against both
of the common activated oncogenic hotspot p110α mutants
that were tested, namely the helical domain E545K mutant
and the C-terminal kinase domain H1047R mutant. Inhibition of p110α was ATP-competitive with a Ki value of 10
nM. The same 3 nM IC50 seen for p110α was also exhibited
against the class 1A PI3K p110δ, although the IC50 values for
the class IA p110β and the class IB p110γ are 10-fold and
25-fold higher at 33 nM and 75 nM, respectively. Because
all these IC50 values are <75 nM, the overall profile is that
of a potent pan-class I PI3K inhibitor with relatively greater
selectivity for the p110α and p110δ isoforms. A very high degree of selectivity was observed against the class III PI3K C2β
(IC50 670 nM) and the class III PI3K Vps34 (1,000 nM). In addition, and in contrast to PI-103, GDC-0941 has a very weak
potency against the class IV PIKKs DNA-PK (1,230 nM) and
mTOR (580 nM). Furthermore, when tested in a panel of 228
protein kinases at a concentration of 1 μM, GDC-0941 was
shown to inhibit only minor activity on Flt3 and TrkA A
(50% and 61% inhibition, respectively), further confirming it
to be a very selective class I PI3K inhibitor (38).
Despite some differences in selectivity compared with
PI-103, especially the markedly reduced potency against
DNA-PK and mTOR, GDC-0941 displayed comparable antiproliferative potency against a panel of human cancer cell
lines and human vascular endothelial cells (HUVEC), suggesting that a high potency against the class IV PIKKs was
not necessary to inhibit tumor cell and HUVEC proliferation
(39). Furthermore, GDC-0941, PI-103, PI-540, and PI-620
showed comparable inhibition of phosphorylation of protein
substrates on the PI3K pathway in cancer cells; for example,
EC50 values were in the range 10 to 36 nM for AKT phosphorylation (39), as measured by quantitative electrochemoluminescent ELISA assays (33, 34, 40). Results indicated that
∼90% inhibition of AKT phosphorylation for several hours is
needed to inhibit cancer cell proliferation, information that
was valuable during lead optimization and identification of
GDC-0941 as the clinical candidate (38, 39) and which should
also inform clinical studies. In addition, this group of com-

www.aacrjournals.org

pounds inhibited translocation of the FKHR forkhead transcription factor with EC50 values of 30 to 81 nM, consistent
with PI3K inhibition (38, 39).
In vivo animal model testing showed that the major reduction in glucuronidation of GDC-0941 afforded by the indazole
substitution resulted in markedly slower systemic clearance
compared with PI-103, PI-540, and PI-640 and, moreover, led
to 78% oral bioavailability in mice, a major advantage over
the other analogs (38, 39). This in turn led to profound and
prolonged inhibition of PI3 kinase pathway biomarkers in
human cancer xenografts, consistent with the sustained tumor drug exposure (39). Thus tumor levels were well above
antiproliferative GI50 concentrations for at least 6 hours, and
decreased phosphorylation of AKT, GSK3β, and P70S6K was
maintained for at least 8 hours (39). As a result of these enhanced pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties,
GDC-0941 exhibited excellent dose-dependent therapeutic
activity in the PTEN null, PI3K pathway-addicted U87MG human glioblastoma xenograft model in athymic mice, with up
to 98% growth inhibition and significant regressions seen in
this model (39).
Efficacy was confirmed in the PI3K-addicted IGROV-1 human ovarian cancer xenograft model, which harbors a
hetT319F deletion and frameshift in PTEN as well as a
p85 binding domain hetR38C mutation in p110α (39). Therapeutic activity was shown in additional human tumor xenografts (41). The linkage of pharmacokinetic exposure,
pharmacodynamic biomarker changes in the PI3K pathway,
and therapeutic tumor response to the drug provided a
convincing pharmacologic audit trail (42, 43), which forms
a good platform for subsequent clinical studies. On the basis of its very attractive molecular, pharmacologic, and therapeutic profile, including minimal effects on cytochrome
P450s and the hERG channel (38), GDC-0941 was selected
for clinical development.

Structural Studies on the PI3 Kinome: Invaluable
Insights and Unfinished Business
The design of GDC-0941 was guided by structural data on
PI3Ks and their interaction with small molecule inhibitors, a
situation that is almost taken for granted in many current
drug discovery programs on soluble drug targets. However,
it was only a decade ago that the first light was shed on the
three-dimensional structure of PI3Ks with the elucidation of
the apo- and ATP-bound crystal structures of porcine p110γ
(44). These studies revealed a five-domain structure, which includes an N-terminal adaptor binding domain (ABD-domain),
a Ras-binding domain (RBD-domain), a C2 domain that has
been proposed to be involved in membrane binding, a helical
domain, and a catalytic domain (Fig. 4A). The fold of the catalytic domain of the lipid kinase turned out to be very similar
to the archetypical protein kinase fold, and comprises an Nterminal and a C-terminal lobe connected by a flexible peptide
linker called the hinge region. Similar to the protein kinases,
the PI3K ATP binding site is located in the groove in between
the two components of the catalytic domain.

However, in contrast to the abundance of protein kinase
structures, the structural studies on PI3Ks have long been restricted to porcine and human p110γ. Nevertheless, crystal
structures of porcine p110γ complexed with ATP and early
non-specific PI3K inhibitors such as LY294002, wortmannin,
and the broad spectrum protein kinase inhibitors quercetin,
myricetin, and staurosporine have yielded exciting insight into the molecular determinants of ligand binding in the ATP
site of PI3Ks (26). For example, the structures show that the
inhibitors fill the space occupied by the adenine moiety of

2152

ATP (Fig. 4B) and show that the overlapping ring systems
bind in the same plane as the adenine group. They further
mimic protein-ATP interactions through the formation of a
hydrogen bond with the backbone nitrogen of the hinge
residue Val 882 (porcine p110γ numbering), which also
interacts with the N1 atom in ATP, analogous to the hingebinding observed for protein kinase inhibitors (Fig. 4B and
C). In addition, the five inhibitors studied extend to some degree into the affinity pocket, located at the back of the ATP
site, which is not occupied by ATP in the ATP-bound

structure (26). This pocket is defined by Lys 833, Asp 836, Leu
838, Asp 841, Asp 861, Tyr 867, Ile 879, and Asp 964 and is
crucial in controlling inhibitor potency (35).
Indeed, the crystal structures of p110γ bound to two potent PI3K inhibitors, the imidazoquinazoline PIK-90 and the
phenylthiazole PIK-93, show that both exploit the affinity
pocket, PIK-90 through its pyridine moiety and PIK-93 using
a chlorine atom (35). In addition, PIK-90 forms the hinge hydrogen bond with the backbone nitrogen of Val 882, whereas
PIK-93 forms two hydrogen bonds with this residue, one with
its backbone amide and one with its carbonyl group. On the
basis of these protein-inhibitor structures, a model of the
binding of PI-103 suggests that the morpholino group of
PI-103 forms the hydrogen bond with the hinge and that
its phenol moiety binds in the affinity pocket (35).
A crystal structure of the tridentate GDC-0941 bound to
human p110γ shows that it is very efficiently anchored in
the ATP-binding site, which may explain its high potency
(Fig. 4D and Supplementary Movie S1; ref. 38). Similar to
the early PI3K inhibitor LY294002, GDC-0941 uses an essential morpholino group to form the key hydrogen bond with
the hinge. In addition, the indazole moiety fits snugly deep in
the affinity pocket with the two indazole nitrogen atoms
forming hydrogen bonds with the hydroxyl group of Tyr
867 and the carboxylate group of Asp 841, further strengthening the interactions in this pocket. Furthermore, the 4methanesulfonyl-piperazin-1-ylmethyl group of GDC-0941
points toward the solvent, with the piperazine ring lying
against the side chain of Met 804 and the oxygen atoms of
the sulfonyl group forming hydrogen bonds with the backbone amide of Ala 805 and the side-chain nitrogen atom of
Lys 802. Finally, the thienopyrimidine scaffold of GDC-0941 is
effectively sandwiched between, on the one hand, the side
chains of Met 953 and Ile 963, which form the floor of the
ATP-binding site, and, on the other hand, the side chains
of Met 804, Trp 812, and Ile 831, which form its ceiling.

As mentioned, so far all crystallographic investigations
into the binding interactions of PI3K inhibitors, from the
first inhibitors to advanced clinical candidates, have been
carried out using porcine and human p110γ. However, as
discussed earlier, it is p110α that is most frequently mutated
and amplified in human cancers (6, 7). The recent elucidation
of the crystal structure of the human p110α/p85α complex
(45) yielded a detailed structural understanding of the effects of oncogenic mutations in PI3Kα. For example, the
p110α/p85α structure with the poorly visible nSH2 domain
of p85 modeled in is consistent with a biochemically identified interaction between the frequently mutated Glu 542,
Glu 545, and Gln 546 with residues in the p85 nSH2 domain
and with the conclusion that mutation of these residues
disrupts the inhibition of the catalytic subunit by this interaction (45). In addition, the structure shows that another
oncogenic mutation hotspot His 1047 is located close to
the C-terminal end of the activation loop, suggesting that
His 1047 mutations could influence the conformation of
the activation loop and therefore affect the binding of phosphoinositide substrates (45). However, both Glu 545 and His
1047 are quite far away from the ATP-binding site in PI3K
(Fig. 4E), and it is therefore not surprising that the oncogenic E545K and H1047R mutations have no effect on the
potency of GDC-0941.
Although the structure elucidation of the p110α/p85α
complex is an important milestone in the structural characterization of the PI3K family, the quest for potent and isoform-specific next generation PI3K inhibitors would greatly
benefit from the availability of protein-inhibitor structures
of this and other isoforms. Unfortunately, the p110α/p85α
structure shows that the crystals used to obtain it are not
suitable for crystallographic soaking experiments, as a loop
from the RBD domain of a neighboring molecule protrudes
into the ATP-binding site, thereby blocking the binding of
nucleotides or small molecule PI3K inhibitors in these crystals.

The RBD domain is shown in red, the C2 domain in yellow, the helical domain in green, and the bilobal catalytic domain in purple. The N-terminal ABD

key PI3K residues displayed and labeled. LY294002 is shown in orange. The critical hydrogen bond is shown as a dotted line. Although LY294002 extends
into the affinity pocket (right-hand side) it does not fill the pocket as efficiently as the indazole moiety of GDC-0941 (see D). D, binding of GDC-0941 to
human p110γ (PDB code 3dbs) showing the hydrogen bond interactions that anchor the inhibitor in the ATP-site. p110γ is shown in purple and GDC-0941
is shown in light green. The oxygen of the morpholino group in GDC-0941 forms a hydrogen bond with the amide of the hinge residue Val 882 (left-hand
side) whereas the indazole moiety (right-hand side) binds deep in the affinity pocket with its two nitrogen atoms forming hydrogen bonds with the side
chains of Tyr 867 and Asp 841, respectively. The oxygen atoms of the sulfonyl group (projecting out of the plane, center) interact with the side chain of
Lys 802 and the amide group of Ala 805 at the mouth of the ATP pocket. E, ribbon diagram of the p110α/p85α structure, showing p110α in yellow and

superimposed on the p110α/p85α complex is shown. The ATP is displayed in cylinder representation with its semitransparent molecular surface
superimposed in blue. Highlighted in red are the oncogenic mutation hotspots Glu 545 and His1047. F, superposition of the GDC-0941-bound p110γ
structure and the human p110α/p85α structure (PDB code 2rd0). The superposition was done using the CCP4 program suite (68). p110α is shown with
its solvent-accessible surface in yellow and GDC-0941 with its (semitransparent) surface in light green. Based on this superposition, the overall fit of
GDC-0941 in the p110α ATP site is very good with only a minor clash of the indazole ring with the wall of the ATP site (right-hand side). It seems likely that
GDC-0941 will be able to form hydrogen bond interactions with the hinge valine (Val 851 human p110α numbering left-hand side) and with the tyrosine and
aspartate side chains (Tyr 836 and Asp 810, p110α numbering; right hand side) in the affinity pocket, as observed in the GDC-0941 p110γ structure.
Differences could occur in the interaction of the sulfonyl oxygens of GDC-0941 (center) with the protein, because the equivalent of Lys 802 in p110γ is
an arginine residue in p110α and the equivalent residue of Ala 805 in p110γ has a different backbone conformation in p110α.

Nevertheless, some insight into inhibitor binding to PI3Kα can
be obtained from superposition of the p110α/p85α structure
with that of p110γ-inhibitor complexes. Such overlays show
that inhibitors like the potent pan-class I-selective imidazoquinazoline PIK-90, phenylthiazole PIK-93, and GDC-0941 itself
(Fig. 4F) would fit into the p110α ATP site with only relatively
minor clashes, consistent with their pan-specific PI3K inhibitor profile. However, the sequence and structural similarities
of the p110α and p110γ ATP sites illustrate the challenges
faced in the design of highly specific PI3K inhibitors.
Despite these challenges, inhibitors are emerging with surprising selectivity profiles, even differentiating between the
class I PI3K isoforms (35), and as a result we are beginning
to uncover the structural determinants that govern selectivity across the PI3Ks. For example, the crystal structure of
p110γ bound to the quinazolinone purine PIK-39 (IC87114),
one of the most isoform-specific (p110δ-selective) PI3K inhibitors to date, suggested that differences in plasticity in
PI3Ks coupled to a conformational rearrangement of Met
804 (porcine p110γ numbering) could provide a mechanism
to obtain isoform selectivity (35). In addition, recent results
have illustrated the role of nonconserved residues at the
entrance of the ATP-pocket with respect to inhibitors that
are surprisingly p110β-selective (46). Future design efforts
could greatly benefit from the availability of structures of
the other class I isoforms PI3Kβ, PI3Kδ, and also class IV
protein kinases such as mTOR, ATM, and ATR. It is therefore
exciting to see the first structural insights provided by the
crystal structures of p110δ in complex with a series of panand PI3Kδ-specific inhibitors that were published at the time
of writing this review (47). These structures reveal a slightly
different binding of GDC-0941 to p110δ compared with its
binding to p110γ. Importantly, in contrast to GDC-0941
and other predominantly flat pan-specific inhibitors, the
new structures also show that the PI3Kδ-specific inhibitors
prefer a propeller shape, which allows them to efficiently exploit the greater plasticity of PI3Kδ, by accessing the socalled specificity pocket that was first observed in the
p110γ-PIK-39 complex.
Understanding the mechanistic basis underlying selectivity
for class I PI3Ks versus PIKKs such as mTOR remains an important goal. As discussed earlier GDC-0941 has much greater selectivity for class I PI3Ks versus mTOR than does PI-103.
Very recent results indicate that when comparing two compounds related to GDC-0941—but in which the indazole
moiety is replaced by an aminopyridine group as the substituent binding in the affinity pocket—the addition of a
single methyl group resulted in a major decrease in mTOR
activity without affecting potency against class I PI3Ks (69).
PI3Kγ-ligand crystal structures showed that in contrast to
the unsubstituted aminopyridine, the 4-methyl group twists
the aminopyridine ring out of plane of the thienopyrimidine
scaffold while steric clashes cause the 4-methyl group to point
away from Tyr867 and towards the ceiling of the ATP binding
pocket. This region and the sequence around Tyr867 show
differences in hydrophobic character and conformation/flexibility respectively that may be hypothesized to account for
the remarkable disparities in pan-class I PI3K and mTOR

2154

Cancer Res; 70(6) March 15, 2010

selectivity between the two compounds. Interestingly, the
selectivity differences did not affect antiproliferative potency
against cancer cells, indicating once again that class I PI3K
activity dictates the therapeutic effect (69).
In addition to the increased understanding of selectivity of
inhibitors within the PI3K family, a recent attempt to identify
hotspots for resistance mutations revealed that, in contrast to
the protein kinases, nonconservative mutations in the PI3K
gatekeeper residue Ile 848 (p110α numbering) are not well tolerated, suggesting that this residue is an unlikely hotspot for
resistance mutations (48). Indeed, the study showed that resistance mutants overall are likely to be less common than
with many protein kinases. Intriguingly, mutations of Ile 800
to leucine and methionine were shown to confer some resistance to a variety of PI3K inhibitors including PIK-90 and PIK93, but the I800L mutation was sensitized to the inhibitors
PW-12 and BEZ-235. From the available crystal structures it
can be seen that Ile 800 and its equivalent in p110γ are located
in the ceiling of the ATP-binding site and interact with a variety of inhibitors through hydrophobic contacts. It therefore
seems reasonable to speculate that mutations of this residue,
in particular to a large methionine residue, could sterically
hinder efficient binding of various classes of inhibitors. It will
be exciting to see the emergence of crystal structures of these
resistant mutants complexed with a variety of inhibitors,
which will undoubtedly aid the design of new PI3K agents.

Context, Progress, Issues, and Outlook
The case history discussed in this article highlights a number of issues that that are of more general significance and
interest.
Tools to drugs. Since the availability of the human genome
sequence,6 there has been an increasingly urgent need to
develop not only genetic tools [such as RNA interference
(RNAi)], but also small molecule probes to interrogate the
function of all genes in normal biology and disease states,
and to identify and exploit druggable targets for clinical benefit. Chemical probes can often give different phenotypes from
RNAi knockdown, for example providing an immediate inhibitory effect that is usually confined to the catalytic activity,
whereas RNAi gives a slower effect and removes the entire protein from the cell. Developments in the biology of PI3Ks and the
discovery of inhibitors have illustrated the value of the combined small molecule and genetic approach very well and the
field has moved forward aggressively over the last few years.
The progression of PI3K inhibitors from bioactive chemical
biology tools, used to probe mechanisms and show feasibility
and consequences of pathway inhibition, into inhibitors with
improved, more drug-like properties that provide preclinical
proof of concept and candidates for clinical evaluation is a pattern that is seen with other molecular targets (10, 49).
To be useful as chemical tools, small molecule inhibitors
need to have at least a minimum level of performance.
On the basis of continuously increasing experience, useful

Drugging the PI3 Kinome

criteria are emerging for chemical tools. For example in the
initial pilot phase of the US National Institutes of Health Molecular Libraries and Imaging Initiative (MLI), the chemical
probes to be generated were envisaged as having “adequate
potency and solubility for in vitro (cell-based) experimentation” but requiring further “chemical modifications … to confer the selectivity, pharmacokinetic, and metabolic properties
required for in vivo use” (50). Increasingly, the focus is not
only on potency (for MLI < 100 nM), but also on selectivity
(for MLI > 10 fold over related targets) and on aqueous solubility, together with demonstrable improvements over existing probes for the designated target (51).7 There is now an
urgent need for chemical tools to be usable in vivo, for example in animal models of cancer, and for this the pharmaceutical, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic demands are
usually much greater, requiring extensive medicinal chemistry efforts. There is in reality a continuum in terms of the
somewhat overlapping criteria for initial chemical hits; improved chemical tools, some of which may evolve into lead
compounds for drug discovery; and eventual clinical candidates. The latter are usually differentiated by virtue of fully
optimized drug-like properties such as oral bioavailability
and freedom from effects on anti-targets such as hERG channels and cytochrome P450s, as exemplified by GDC-0941.
The early chemical tools for PI3K inhibition, particularly
wortmannin and LY294002, were extremely valuable but
clearly had limitations. The case history reviewed herein illustrates how various micromolar hits were improved to a potent and selective chemical tool inhibiting class I PI3Ks/
mTOR (PI-103), then into more advanced leads and potential
preclinical drug candidates (PI-540 and P-620), and finally into the eventual pan-class I PI3K drug GDC-0941 that is now in
phase I clinical trials. In addition to the lessons learned when
morphing from a chemical biology tool to a clinical candidate,
another take-home message is the value of structure-based
strategies now used in all stages in the design of molecular
cancer therapeutics against a wide variety of targets (52). A
structure-based approach was also used in another example,
the imidazoquinoline clinical agent BEZ-235, which is, like
PI-103, a dual class I PI3K/mTOR inhibitor; BEZ-235 evolved
by target-hopping from a PDK1 inhibitor lead (53). There are
now at least nine PI3K inhibitors in the clinic with various
isoform selectivity profiles (23, 24, 54).8
Isoform selectivity, biomarkers, efficacy, and tolerability.
A key challenge for the development of inhibitors of
p110α isoforms and indeed other PI3K pathway inhibitors
in cancer is to determine the optimal selectivity profile, or
more likely profiles, and to identify those patients in which
a particular profile will be most effective (4, 5, 9, 23, 54).
Intriguing new results suggest that genetic context will be
key. For example, whereas tumor cells harboring activating
p110α are dependent on this isoform, consistent with addiction to it, PTEN-deficient cancer cells are, in contrast,
dependent on p110β (55). Further confusing the issue is

7

http://clinicaltrials.gov

www.aacrjournals.org

the finding that p110β seems to have a role that is not dependent on kinase catalytic activity (9, 56). In addition,
AKT-independent signaling downstream of oncogenic
p110α has been discovered, involving PDK1/SGK3 (57).
The p110δ isoform is mainly restricted to hemopoietic cells
and may be a target in leukemia and lymphoma as well as
immune and inflammatory disease (9). Results with chemical inhibitors do not currently give a clear picture about the
impact of PI3K pathway and RAS mutations on sensitivity
to agents that generally hit the class I PI3Ks, with or without mTOR (reviewed in refs. 39, 54).
In the case of GDC-0941, findings to date suggest that although cancer cells lines with mutations in PIK3CA or loss of
PTEN expression are often sensitive to this agent, whereas
some with RAS mutations may be resistant, the drug nevertheless shows broad activity across malignant cell panels and
human tumor xenografts (39, 41). One contributory factor is
that cancer cells with activated upstream receptor tyrosine
kinases may also be sensitive. The situation in vivo may be
further complicated by the clear anti-angiogenic effects of
class I/mTOR inhibitors (33, 53), which may relate to the role
of p110α in endothelial cell migration and vascular development shown by mouse genetic studies (58). In addition, PI3K
inhibitors may exert other effects on the tumor microenvironment and immune cells (4). In some ways the above results argue for the broad therapeutic utility of pan-class I
inhibitors, assuming that such agents are well tolerated,
which seems to be the case from animal model studies and
early clinical trials (5, 23). Prediction of sensitivity may require more complex signatures rather than single mutational
events. Nevertheless, it is not unreasonable to look for initial
clinical activity by enriching trials with patients with 1) oncogenic mutations in PIK3CA, 2) loss of PTEN expression, or
3) activated receptor tyrosine kinases, before broadening the
studies to a wider patient population. The alternative is to
treat a more diverse cohort of patients up front and to collect
information on their molecular status.
Although inhibition of p110α was predicted to block insulin
signaling and potentially to induce diabetes (35, 36), this does
not seem to be a problem with chronic dosing. Experience with
protein kinase inhibitors in the clinic, where inhibition of multiple kinases can be advantageous (10), would support the view
that at least limited polypharmacology with PI3K inhibitors
may be a good thing. Inhibitors of specific isoforms may be
valuable in particular settings (see above). Drugs targeting particular isoforms could avoid particular side-effects (5). For example, p110α/β inhibitors that do not hit p110γ and p110δ
would likely spare immune cells. p110δ-selective inhibitors
may be advantageous in some leukemias and lymphomas
and avoid possible metabolic effects on p110α/β. Preferential
activity on p110α may be desirable in cancers with mutant
p110α, whereas p110β selectivity may be valuable in PTEN-deficient malignancies. There are no reports of inhibitors selective to mutant versus wild-type p110α, which could have
advantages in relevant cancers addicted to that mutant
kinase. Ongoing use of chemical biology and structure-based
design approaches should continue to deliver a variety of
isoform-specific or pan-selective profiles. Unexpected cancer

dependencies and synthetic lethalities may emerge, as shown
by the preferential activity of PI3K pathway inhibitors in mismatch repair-deficient colorectal cell lines (59).
Combinations. Experience with modern targeted molecular cancer therapeutics (10) suggests that the presence of
multiple genetic abnormalities and the induction of feedback
loops and other resistance mechanisms is likely to mean that
PI3K inhibitors will need to be given in combination with
other agents (4, 5). In support of this approach, recent studies with GDC-0941 have shown promising results by combining this agent with the HER2-directed antibody trastuzumab,
including treatment of trastuzumab-resistant cancer models
(60, 61). The combination of GDC-0941 with a BRAF inhibitor
was beneficial in cancer models with oncogenic BRAF and
PTEN deficiency (62), and dual blockade involving GDC-0941
with a MEK inhibitor was advantageous in PTEN wild-type or
PTEN null basal-like breast cancer models (63). “Horizontal”
inhibition of parallel pathways as well as “vertical” blockade
at more than one point within the PI3K pathway are of great
interest, while also recognizing that these pathways likely
operate in complex networks in which the outcomes of
pharmacologic modulation may be difficult to predict.
Concluding remarks. The 20-plus-year journey from
chemical tools to PI3K drugs has been an exciting and productive one. We have interesting times ahead as the first generation of PI3K inhibitors progress through early clinical
trials. Initial reports from phase I clinical trials show GDC0941 to be well tolerated with appropriate pharmacokinetics,
biomarker evidence of target modulation, and some signs of
biologic activity (64, 65). A number of other inhibitors of PI3K
are now in the clinic (22, 23). With suitable pharmacodynamic biomarkers in hand to show proof of mechanism, the key
challenges are now to identify predictive biomarkers so that

PI3K inhibitors can be directed to the most appropriate
patients, to sort out the preferred inhibitor selectivity profiles
for patients with various pathway abnormalities (66), and to
develop rational mechanism-based combinatorial treatments
for optimal therapeutic efficacy.
