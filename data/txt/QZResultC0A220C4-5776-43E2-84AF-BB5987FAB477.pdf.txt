ABSTRACT
In this study, we compared the blood serum levels of circulating cell-free and
exosomal microRNAs, and their involvement in the molecular subtypes of breast cancer
patients. Our analyses on cell-free miR-101, miR-372 and miR-373 were performed
in preoperative blood serum of 168 patients with invasive breast cancer, 19 patients
with benign breast diseases and 28 healthy women. MicroRNAs were additionally
quantified in exosomes of 50 cancer patients and 12 healthy women from the same
cohort. Relative concentrations were measured by quantitative TaqMan MicroRNA
assays and correlated to clinicopathological risk factors. The concentrations of
cell-free miR-101 (p=0.013) and miR-373 (p=0.024) were significantly different
between patients with breast cancer and benign tumors. A prevalence of miR-101, miR372 and miR-373 were found in exosomes. The levels of circulating exosomal (but not
cell-free) miR-373 were higher in triple negative than luminal carcinomas (p=0.027).
Also, estrogen-negative (p=0.021) and progesterone-negative (p=0.01) tumors
displayed higher concentrations of exosomal miR-373 than patients with hormonereceptor positive tumors. Overexpression of miR-373 by transfection of MCF-7 cells
showed downregulated protein expression of the estrogen receptor, and inhibition of
apoptosis induced by camptothecin. Our data indicate that serum levels of exosomal
miR-373 are linked to triple negative and more aggressive breast carcinomas.

and/or PR+ and either HER2- with a high Ki-67 value or
HER2+ with any Ki-67 value. Basal-like tumors display
an expression pattern of basal myoepithelial markers
and are mainly triple negative, thus ER-, PR- and HER2-.
They account for about 10–15% of all invasive breast
cancers. The HER2+ subtype is ER-, PR- and HER2+. The
subtypes are associated with different clinical features and
outcomes and predictive of responses to specific therapies.
The clinical behavior of basal-like and HER2+ subtypes is
more aggressive than that of luminal tumors, whereas the
luminal A subtype corresponds to low-proliferating tumors
with a good prognosis factor [2].

INTRODUCTION
Profiling by immunohistochemical assays using
estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR),
and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)
classifies breast cancer into four phenotypically distinct
subtypes: luminal A, luminal B, basal-like and HER2+
tumors. The quantification of the proliferation marker
Ki-67 also supports this classification, which is a
commonly accepted clinical adaption of the subtypes
originally described by molecular analysis [1]. The
expression pattern of luminal subtypes partially resembles
that of the luminal epithelial layer of the mammary gland.
The luminal A subtype is ER+ and/or PR+ and HER2-,
with low Ki-67 levels and the luminal B subtype is ER+

expression post-transcriptionally by binding specifically
to the 3′untranslated-region (UTR) of their target mRNA.
This gene silencing can occur through translational
inhibition of the mRNAs or their cleavage depending on
the complementarity between binding site sequences of
the target mRNA and miR [3]. Computational analyses
indicate that one miR has binding affinity to hundreds
of different mRNAs and hence, miRs are involved in
the regulation of various cellular processes, such as
development, differentiation and proliferation [4]. As
miR loci frequently map to fragile chromosomal regions
harboring DNA amplifications, deletions or translocations,
their expression is often deregulated during tumorigenesis,
contributing to tumor progression [5]. In this context,
they may act as so-called oncomiRs by targeting tumor
suppressor genes or as tumor suppressor miRs by
inhibiting oncogenes [6]. MiRs are released into the blood
circulation by apoptotic and necrotic cells or by active
secretion in small particles [7], and thus, exist either cellfree, associated with proteins or in exosomes in blood
[8]. Exosomes are membrane-derived vesicles and may
be important mediators of intercellular communication.
They transfer lipids, proteins, mRNAs and miRs from
one cell to another cell [9]. Thereby, tumor cell-derived
exosomes have an emerging role in tumor progression and
metastases [10].
To date numerous miRs have been identified,
those transcript levels were dysregulated in the blood of
breast cancer patients [11, 12]. However, little is known
whether dysregulated miR expression levels reflect the
distinct molecular subtypes of breast cancer [12]. In our
recent study we detected that increased concentrations
of miR-373 in postoperative serum of breast cancer
patients were associated with negative HER2 status of the
primary tumor [13]. This interesting finding provoked us
to analyze the miR-373 cluster, consisting of miR-371,
miR-372 and miR-373, in particular. The cluster is
specifically expressed in human embryonic stem cells
(ESCs) and frequently upregulated in several tumors.
A role of miR-371 as potential serum biomarker for
testicular germ cell tumors was reported [14]. Invasion and
metastasis of breast cancer may be stimulated by miR-373,
at least partly by direct inhibition of protein expression
of the cell surface marker CD44 [15]. MiR-372 and -373
were reported to activate the Wnt/β-catenin-signaling
pathway, which is involved in both stem cell maintenance
and tumorigenesis [16]. We also focused on circulating
miR-101, because this miR plays a role in estrogenindependent signaling and is linked with reduced PTEN
(phosphatase and tensin homolog) activity leading to Akt
activation [17]. MiR-101 belongs to a family of miRs that
is involved in a series of cellular activities, such as cell
proliferation, invasion and angiogenesis, and is located in
a genomic fragile region that is associated with abnormal
deletion or amplification in cancer [18, 19].

The aim of our study was to evaluate whether
dysregulated levels of circulating miR-101, miR371, miR-372 and miR-373, cell-free or localized in
exosomes, can be detected in the blood serum of breast
cancer patients, and whether these changes are associated
with the pathogenesis of this cancer entity. Based on
the advantages of blood-based “liquid biopsies” over
tissue biopsies and the characteristics of these miRs,
their screening could provide valuable non-invasive
information in the context of distinct molecular subtypes
of breast cancer.

RESULTS
Profiling of cell-free miR-101, miR-371, miR-372
and miR-373 in the serum of patients with breast
cancer or benign breast disease
We quantified the relative levels of cell-free miR101, miR-371, miR-372 and miR-373 in the serum of
168 patients with invasive breast cancer before surgery,
19 patients with benign disease and 28 healthy women. As
shown in the box plot of Figure 1A, the serum levels of
cell-free miR-101 could significantly differentiate between
breast cancer and benign breast disease (p=0.013). There
was a continuous rise of serum levels of miR-101 from
healthy women over patients with benign breast disease
(p=0.024) to patients with breast cancer (p=0.0001).
It was surprising to detect the different regulation of miR371, miR-372 and miR-373 that are located in the same
cluster on the chromosomal region of 19q13.42. The
miR-371 levels were too low to quantify them (data not
shown), and the concentrations of cell-free miR-372 were
not dysregulated in patients with breast cancer or benign
diseases, whereas the concentrations of miR-373 increased
in both (benign, p=0.0001 and malignant, p=0.001) patient
cohorts compared with healthy individuals. In contrast
to serum miR-101, the serum levels of miR-373 were
significantly higher in patients with benign breast diseases
than in patients with breast cancer (p=0.024), but could,
consequently, differentiate between these two patient
cohorts (Figure 1A).
We divided our cohort of 168 patients into the
molecular subtypes of breast cancer: 60 luminal A (ER+
and/or PR+, HER2-, Ki-67 low), 59 luminal B (ER+ and/
or PR+, HER2- and Ki-67 high or HER2+ and Ki-67 low/
high), 33 triple negative (ER-, PR-, HER2-) and 5 HER2+
(ER-, PR-, HER2+) patients. For statistical reasons, we
combined the luminal A and B subtype. In the subtypes,
the serum levels of miR-101 and miR-373 were often
significantly higher than the levels in patients with benign
breast diseases or healthy individuals, but they did not
differentiate between the subtypes. With the exception
of luminal tumors (p=0.035), the concentrations of­

cell-free miR-372 were not dysregulated in the subtypes
(Figure 1B).
In addition, we compared the concentrations of cellfree miR-101, miR-372 and miR-373 with the clinical
and histopathological risk factors. Supplementary table 1
summarizes the median, mean and p values, as well as the
95 percentiles of the miR variables in the different patient
subgroups. We detected that the serum levels of cell-free
miR-101 significantly correlated with negative lymph
node status (p=0.008, Supplementary figure 1), indicating
that a decrease in its concentration plays a role in lymphnode positive cancer and an increase plays rather a role
in non-metastatic cancer. No further correlations with the
clinicopathological parameters were detected.

be explained by the fact that the raw CT values of miR101, miR-372 and miR-373 were similar between serum
and exosomes. However, the CT values of the endogenous
control miRs (miR-16 and miR-484) were higher in
the exosomes than in the serum, whereas the values of
healthy controls and breast cancer patients were similar
in each fraction (see Material and Methods). As a result
the normalization led to higher relative values of miR101, miR-372 and miR-373 in the exosomal fraction than
in the serum. Hence, our findings point to a predominant
circulation of miR-101, miR-372 and miR-373 in exosomes
in the bloodstream. Moreover, the levels of exosomal
miR-101 (p=0.0001) and miR-372 (p=0.021) were tumorspecifically increased, thus, higher in breast cancer patients
than healthy controls, whereas the levels of exosomal miR373 showed no significant difference between breast cancer
patients and healthy women (Figure 2A).
In all three molecular subtypes (HER2+, p=0.022;
luminal, p=0.001; triple negative, p=0.001), the serum
levels of exosomal miR-101 were dysregulated compared
with the levels in healthy women. Again, with the
exception of luminal tumors (p=0.015), the concentrations
of exosomal miR-372 were not dysregulated in the
subtypes. The serum levels of exosomal (but not of cellfree) miR-373 were significantly higher in triple negative
than in luminal breast cancer (p=0.027) and healthy
women (p=0.001, Figure 2B). Likewise, the serum levels
of exosomal miR-373 were also higher in ER- (p=0.021,
Figure 3A) and PR- (p=0.013, Figure 3B) breast cancer
patients than the analogous receptor-positive patients,

For the additional extraction of exosomes and
analyses of exosomal miRs, sufficient amounts of serum
were only available from 50 breast cancer patients and 12
healthy individuals within our cohorts (Supplementary

miR-101, miR-372 and miR-373 in the serum of these
cancer patients with those of healthy women. In both
cohorts the relative serum concentrations of the exosomal
miRs were usually higher than those of the cell-free
miRs (Figure  2A). This increase in exosomal miRs can

shown). The real-time PCR data showed no change in
ER mRNA levels through an overexpression of miR373 (Figure.  4B). However, as shown in Western blot
analysis using an ER-specific antibody, overexpression of
miR-373 could downregulate the protein levels of ER in
MCF-7 cells. However, the transfected expression plasmid
encoding for miR-373 had a stronger inhibitory effect
on ER protein expression than the transfected miR-373
mimic (Figure 4C). Moreover, we also transfected MCF7 cells with a single stranded miScript miRNA Inhibitor
hsa-miR-373 that has binding affinity to the endogenous
miR-373. In contrast to the above data, we did not observe
any effect on ER protein expression. This discrepancy may
be explained by a rather low miR-373 expression level
(Ct of 35.52 with standard deviation of 0.38) in MCF7 cells that can be hardly influenced by the exogenous
inhibitor (Figure 4C).
To verify the inhibitory effect of miR-373 on ER
protein expression, we carried out a luciferase assay. We
transiently co-transfected a reporter plasmid containing
the 3′UTR of ER with three binding sites of miR-373
with an expression plasmid of miR-373 or miR-373
mimic or inhibitor into MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells,
and measured the luciferase activity. Ectopic expression
of miR-373 did not decrease the luciferase activity.
However, inhibition of miR-373 increased the activity in
MCF-7 cells (p=0.006), but not in MB-MDA-231 cells
(Figure 4D).
These somewhat discrepant results between Western
blot and luciferase assay cannot be explained, but they
suggest that miR-373 is involved in the repression of

MiR-373 affects the protein expression of
estrogen receptor
Since our findings suggest that miR-373 is associated
with receptor-negative breast cancer, we examined
whether ER or PR are targets of miR-373. Therefore,
we screened the miR databases DIANA-microT-CDS
[20], microRNA.org [21] and TargetScanHuman [22] for
potential binding sites of miR-373 in the 3′UTRs of ER
and PR. We only detected a potential binding site in the
3′UTR of ER, but not in PR.
To examine, whether the expression of ER is
downregulated by miR-373, we first investigated the
expression levels of ER in cell lines MCF-7, MDAMB-231 and micrometastatic breast cancer cells BC-M1.
We found high RNA and protein expression levels of ER
in MCF-7 cells, whereas MDA-MB-231 and BC-M1 cells
only expressed low levels of ER mRNA, but no protein
(Figure 4A). Therefore, only MCF-7 cells were transiently
transfected with miR-373 mimic or an expression plasmid
encoding for miR-373. The mimics are double-stranded
RNA molecules which mimic the mature endogenous
miR-373. We confirmed the overexpression of miR373 in the transfected cells by real-time PCR (data not

Our current findings show that low levels of miR-101
correlate with a positive lymph node status. To examine
whether this observation can be explained by an effect of
miR-101 on cell migration and invasion, respective assays
were carried out using MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells.
We, therefore, used these two cell lines, because MCF-7
and MDA-MB-231 cells display low and high migration/
invasion potential, respectively. Using transwell assays, we
couldn’t observe any change in cell migration or invasion
after transfection of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells by
miR-101 mimic or inhibitor (Supplementary figure 3).

DISCUSSION

which might indicate inflammation. In contrast to the
increased concentrations of cell-free miR-101 in tumor
patients compared with healthy women, we detected that
the serum levels of miR-101 negatively correlated with
lymph node status. Our findings suggest that decreased
miR-101 concentrations are associated with lymph-node
positive cancer and an increase plays rather a role in
non-advanced cancer. Although miR-371, miR-372 and
miR-373 are localized in the same cluster, miR-371 was
not detectable in serum, and miR-372 was not dysregulated
in benign and malignant tumors. The levels of exosomal
miR-101 and miR-372 were tumor-specifically increased
and higher in breast cancer patients than in healthy
women. Whereas a tumor-specific increase for both,
cell-free and exosomal miR-101 was observed, the data
on cell-free and exosomal miR-372 and miR-373 were
converse. The levels of exosomal (but not of cell-free)

In the present study we demonstrate that in breast
cancer patients and healthy women the relative exosomal
serum concentrations of miR-101, miR-372 and miR-373
were usually higher than their cell-free levels, indicating
that these miRs may predominantly circulate in exosomes
in the peripheral blood. Furthermore, the serum levels
of cell-free miR-101 and miR-373 could significantly
differentiate between breast cancer and benign breast
disease, indicating their potential diagnostic value. The
reasons for the high miR-373 levels in the serum of
patients with benign breast disease are unclear, but could
be explained among others by the fact that benign lesions
reflect inflammatory processes resulting in elevated
apoptotic cell death. Our recent report [23] showed that
the levels of miR-373 were still increased after surgery

miR-372 and of cell-free (but not of exosomal) miR-373
increased in breast cancer patients. In particular, the serum
levels of exosomal (but not of cell-free) miR-373 were
significantly higher in triple negative than in luminal breast
cancer. Likewise, the serum levels of exosomal miR-373
were also higher in ER- and PR- breast cancer patients than
in the corresponding receptor-positive patients, indicating
the association of exosomal miR-373 with negative
receptor status. Our functional analyses showed that
miR-373 may downregulate the protein expression of ER
and inhibit apoptosis induced by camptothecin.
As far as we know, our present article is the first
study reporting the comparison between cell-free and
exosomal miRs in breast cancer patients and healthy
women. Usually, we detected the prevalence of miR-101,
miR-372 and miR-373 in the exosomal serum fraction
of breast cancer patients and healthy women. Whether
miRs exist cell-freely in the blood circulation or are
transported by secreted exosomes has been discussed [24].
Our present data support both possibilities but with
a predominant circulation of miRs in exosomes. The
high miR concentrations observed in exosomes may be
dependent on that exosomes protect miRs from digestion
by RNases and, therefore, exosomal miRs may circulate
more stable in blood than cell-free, unbound miRs.
A number of published studies have reported that
miR-101 is obviously down-regulated and negatively
associated with tumor growth and blood vessel formation
in several solid epithelial cancer types, e.g., glioblastoma,
non-small cell lung cancer or ovarian cancer [18, 25, 26].
In contrast to the published data, our findings show a
cancer-specific increase in serum miR-101 in breast
cancer patients compared with patient with benign breast
disease and healthy women, but a decrease in lymph
node-negative breast cancer, suggesting a dual role for
miR-101 in breast cancer. A dual role was also described
for miR-101 in the context of estradiol (E2)-independent
and -dependent growth. Although miR-101 inhibited cell
growth in normal E2-containing medium, it promoted
cell growth in E2-free medium. Moreover, estrogen
deprivation significantly enhanced miR-101-mediated
activation of the Akt signaling pathway [17], which gives
rise to increased cell survival, malignant transformation,
invasiveness and metastasis of breast cancer [27]. Similar
to our data showing that the serum levels of cell-free miR101 were significantly higher in patients with breast cancer
than in patients with benign breast disease, the expression
of miR-101 was also significantly higher in another cancer
type, in malignant pheochromocytoma, as compared with
its benign counterpart [28]. Besides, lower expression of
miR-101 was associated with poor prognosis of patients
with endometrial serous adenocarcinomas [29] and might
endure our observation on the decreased serum levels of
miR-101 in lymph-node positive breast cancer patients.
The association of miR-101 with lymph node status does
not seem to be caused by a change in cell invasion or
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

migration through miR-101, as shown by our functional
analyses.
For miR-372 and miR-373, different results
regarding their cell-free or exosomal concentrations in
breast cancer patients and healthy women were found. To
explain this difference it is necessary to further examine
the exosomal fraction and to distinguish between tumorderived and wild type-derived exosomes. In this regard,
Rupp et al. reported that breast cancer patients have
increased amounts of exosomes but that there is still a lack
for a tumor-exosomal marker protein [30].
In respect to serum miR-373, the levels of
exosomal miR-373 were associated with negative ER and
PR status. The serum concentrations were higher in ERand PR- patients than in patients with positive receptor
status, and higher in triple negative than in luminal
breast carcinomas. Our findings point to the ability of
miR-373 to downregulate these receptors. However,
a screening of different miR databases showed that
with the exception of ER, the other two receptors PR
and HER2 are not predicted to be targeted by miR373. In this context, our functional analyses showed
that miR-373 was able to downregulate the protein
expression of ER. This downregulation, which was
also demonstrated in a previous study [31], may be
linked to increased transcript levels of miR-373 in ERbreast cancer. Surprisingly, the levels of cell-free miR373 did not reflect the increase in exosomal miR-373 in
receptor-negative tumors. Based on the clinical behavior
of the basal-like breast cancer subtype, including
triple negative tumors [2], exosomal miR-373 may be
associated with more aggressive tumors. This assumption
is also supported by our transfection studies. Modulation
of miR-373 expression in MCF-7 cells revealed that
this miR inhibited apoptosis of MCF-7 cells, which
was induced by camptothecin, but had no effect on
cell proliferation. In contrast to breast cancer cells, a
previous report showed that miR-373 could increase
the cell proliferation of esophageal cancer cells [32].
As far as we know, our study demonstrates, for the first
time, that miR-373 is involved in the apoptosis mediated
by camptothecin but further studies are necessary to
analyze the proteins targeted by miR-373 in this process.
Finally, it has been recently reported that miR-373 may
be a potential plasma-based biomarker for detecting the
lymph node status of breast cancer [33]. However, we
could not detect such an association of serum miR-373
with lymph node metastases in our study cohort.
In conclusion, our findings suggest cell-free miR101 and miR-373 as breast cancer-specific markers.
Moreover, the association of increased exosomal serum
levels of miR-373 with receptor-negative tumors and
its anti-apoptotic character show the potential role of
exosomal miR-373 as a blood-based biomarker for
more aggressive tumors. Prospective studies on larger
cohorts of patients are required to substantiate the

extracted using RIPA (150mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 0.5%
sodium-deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 50mM Tris/HCl, pH 8)
buffer. The extraction of exosomes was verified by Western
Blot using an antibody specific for the exosomal marker
proteins CD63 (BioCat), Mucin1 (CD227, BD Biosciences)
and GAPDH (Sigma, Supplementary figure 4).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study populations
Serum samples from 168 patients with primary
breast cancer before surgery and chemotherapy and
19 patients with benign breast disease (10 patients with
fibroadenoma, 8 patients with mastopathy and 1 patient
with papilloma) were obtained from the Clinic of
Gynecology of the University Medical Center HamburgEppendorf. In addition, serum samples were collected
from 28 age-matched healthy women with no history of
cancer and in good health based on self-report.
Women were eligible for inclusion in this project,
if they had histologically confirmed primary invasive
breast cancer (International Classification of Diseases) and
diagnosed between January 2001 and September 2005.
The study was approved by the ethic committee of the
Medical Board of Hamburg, and conducted in accordance
with the Declaration of Helsinki. All study participants
gave written informed consent.
Tumors were histologically categorized as
ductal, lobular and for statistical reasons as all others
(1 invasive mucinous, 3 invasive papillar, 2 invasive
ductal-mucinous, 4 invasive tubular, 4 invasive medullar
breast cancer and 5 unknown patients). Grading of all
invasive carcinomas was based on a modification of
Bloom and Richardson, recommended by Elston and
Ellis [34]. Hormone receptor status was determined
using immunohistochemical assays and immunoreactive
scoring according to Remmele and Stegner [35].
HER2 expression was assessed using standardized
immunohistochemical analyses. In case of an ambiguous
positive reaction (DAKO score 2+), these analyses were
followed by a fluorescent in situ hybridization test. The
clinicopathological data of the patients are listed in
Table 1.

Conversion of total RNA into cDNA
Reverse transcription was performed by the TaqMan
MicroRNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Life Technologies)
briefly after RNA extraction. The 10 μL-reverse
transcription reaction contained 0.1 μL 100 mM
dNTPs, 0.66 μL MultiScribe Reverse Transcriptase
(50 U/μL), 1 μL 10× Reverse Transcription Buffer,
0.13 μL RNase Inhibitor (20 U/μL), 2 µL 5x TaqMan
RT Primer, nuclease-free water and 4 μL RNA. The
reaction was carried out at 16°C for 30 min., 42°C for
30 min. and 85°C for 5 min. on a MJ Research PTC-200
Peltier Thermal Cycler (Global Medical Instrumentation,
Ramsey, Minnesota, USA). The cDNA samples were
stored at -20°C until further usage.

Preamplification of miR-371, miR-372, miR-373,
miR-16 and miR-484 cDNA
Due to the low expression levels of miR-371, miR372 and miR-373 in healthy women, a preamplification of
its cDNA was performed. For an accurate normalization,
cDNA of the reference miR-16 and miR-484 was also
preamplified. The cDNAs were preamplified in 5µL Taq
PCR Mastermix, 0.5 µL 20x TaqMan MiRNA Assay mix
and nuclease-free water by using the Taq PCR Mastermix
Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The PCR was run on an
MJ Research PTC-200 Peltier Thermal Cycler (Global
Medical Instrumentation): 1 cycle at 95°C for 5 min.,
15 cycles at 95°C for 20 s, 60°C for 20 s and 72°C for 20
s and a terminal cycle at 72°C for 5 min.

Extraction of total RNA
Extraction of total RNA from human blood
serum was performed by the mirVana PARIS kit (Life
Technologies, New York, USA) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Four hundred μL of serum
were incubated with an equal volume of Denaturation
Solution for 5 min. on ice. For RNA extraction acidphenol:chloroform was used, and precipitation was carried
out by ethanol and a filter cartridge. The RNA was eluted
in 100 μL of preheated Elution Solution and quantified
on a NanoDrop ND-1000 Spectrophotometer (Thermo
Scientific, Wilmington, Delaware, USA). The RNA
samples were immediately stored at -80°C until they were
reverse transcribed into cDNA.

Quantitative real-time PCR of miR-101,
miR-371, miR-372 and miR-373
For quantitative real-time PCR, the miR-specific
TaqMan MicroRNA Assays (Life Technologies) for
miR-16 and miR-484 (reference miRs), miR-101,
miR-371, miR-372 and miR-373 (candidate miRs) were
used. MiR-16 and miR-484 were, therefore, used as
reference miRs, because they were constantly expressed

in our study populations and recommended as reference
miRs in the literature [36, 37]. Despite other reports
miR-16 was equally expressed in healthy women, patients
with a benign breast disease and breast cancer patients,
as shown by the raw CT-values given below. For the
normalization of RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis 20
fmol of synthetic cel-39 was added to the serum samples
after addition of the denaturation solution. In a 10 μLreaction, 1 μL cDNA were mixed with 5 μL TaqMan
Universal PCR Master Mix No AmpErase UNG and 0.5 μL
miR-specific TaqMan MicroRNA Assay Mix on a twin-tec
real-time PCR plate (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany). The
quantitative real-time PCR reaction was performed at 95°C
for 10 min. and in 40 cycles at 95°C for 15 s and 60°C for
60 s on a Mastercycler Realplex (Eppendorf).
The obtained data of the miR expression levels were
calculated and evaluated by the ΔCt method as follows:
ΔCt = mean value Ct (mean of reference miR-16, miR484 and cel-39) - mean value Ct (miR of interest). The
relative expression of the miR of interest corresponded to
the 2^(ΔCt) value.
To verify whether the normalization of the
expression data of miR-101, miR-371, miR-372 and miR373 by miR-16 and miR-484 was accurate, we analyzed
the miR-16 and miR-484 expression levels, and found that
the levels remained relatively constant across the serum
samples. We calculated a mean value of both miRs of 26.8,
27.3 and 27.2 with a standard deviation of 1.4, 1.7 and 1.4
for the groups of patients with breast cancer, patients with
benign breast disease and healthy women, respectively.
For the expression of exosomal miR-16 and miR-484 we
calculated a mean value of both miRs of 28.9 and 28.6
with a standard deviation of 1.1 and 1.3 for the patients
with breast cancer and healthy women, respectively.

6-well plates (NUNC, Roskilde, Denmark) and transfected
with 1 µg of an expression plasmid encoding for miR-373
or the double-stranded miScript miRNA Mimic hsamiR-373 at final concentrations of 5nM (Qiagen) or the
single stranded miScript miRNA Inhibitor hsa-miR-373
at final concentrations of 25nM (Qiagen) and with 2 µL
X-tremeGENE HP DNA Transfection Reagent (Roche
Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany). After incubation
of 48h, total RNA and protein were extracted using
peqGOLD TriFast (Peqlab, Erlangen, Germany) according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. Proteins were quantified
by the DC protein assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories) according
to the manufacturer’s instructions.
The expression plasmid encoding for miR-373
was constructed by annealing the DNA sequences of
5′-TCATACTCGAGATCTGGGATACTCAAAATGGGG
GCGCTTTCCTTTTTGTCTGTACTGG-3′ and 5′-AACC
GCTCGAGGATCCGGGACACCCCAAAATCGAAGCA
CTTCCCAGTACAGACAAAAA-3′. The 5′ overhanging
ends were filled in by the Klenow fragment DNA
polymerase (Thermo Scientific). The ­double-stranded
DNA was cut by the restriction enzyme XhoI (New
England Biolabs, Frankfurt, Germany) and cloned into the
XhoI site of the pcDNA 3.1 vector (Life Technologies).
The cloned expression plasmid was verified by DNA
sequencing.
To analyze whether miR-101 has an influence on
the expression of cell migration or invasion, 3*105 of
MCF-7 or MDA-MB-231 cells were seeded on 6-well
plates (NUNC, Roskilde, Denmark) and transfected
with the double-stranded miScript miRNA Mimic hsamiR-101 at final concentrations of 5nM (Qiagen) or
with the single stranded miScript miRNA Inhibitor hsamiR-101 at final concentrations of 25nM (Qiagen) with
2 µL X-tremeGENE HP DNA Transfection Reagent
(Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany). Transient
transfection efficiency was confirmed by real-time PCR
of the transfected miR.

Cell culture
The breast adenocarcinoma cell lines MCF-7
and MDA-MB-231 were cultured in DMEM (Life
Technologies) supplemented with 10% FCS (fetal
calf serum; PAA Laboratories, Cölbe, Germany) and
2 mM L-glutamin (Life Technologies) under standard
conditions (37°C, 10% CO2, humidified atmosphere). The
micrometastatic BC-M1 (breast cancer) cells were cultured
at 37°C, 5% CO2 and 10% O2 in RPMI (Invitrogen,
Karlsruhe, Germany) supplemented with 10%  FCS
(PAA Laboratories), 2 mM L-glutamin (Invitrogen),
10 mg/mL Insulin-Transferrin-Selenium-A (Invitrogen),
50 ng/mL recombinant human epidermal growth
factor, and 10 ng/mL human basic fibroblast growth factor
(Miltenyl Biotec, Bergisch-Gladbach, Germany). Cell
viability was determined by trypan blue staining.

Quantitative real-time PCR and Western Blot of
ER expression
To determine the mRNA expression of ER, a
total of 200 ng RNA from basal and transfected cells
was reverse transcribed using the First strand cDNA
synthesis kit (Thermo Scientific). The mRNA expression
levels were subsequently quantified by real-time PCR
using the Maxima SYBR Green/ROX qPCR Master
Mix (Thermo Scientific) and the following primers for
ER (forward: 5′-GCATTCTACAGGCCAAATTCA-3′;
reverse:
5′-TCCTTGGCAGATTCCATAGC-3′).
GAPDH
(5′-CCTGCACCACCAACTGCTTAG-3′,
5′-TGGCATGGACTGTGGTCATG-3′)
served
as
reference gene. The reaction was performed at 95°C for
15 min. and in 40 cycles at 95°C for 15 s, 60°C for 30 s
and 72°C for 30 s on a Mastercycler Realplex (Eppendorf).

Transient transfection of miR-373 and miR-101
To analyze whether miR-373 has an influence on the
expression of ER, 3*105 of MCF-7 cells were seeded on

Protein levels of ER in basal and transfected cells
were investigated by Western blot analysis. Thirty µg of
cell lysates were electrophoretically separated and blotted
onto a PVDF membrane (Millipore, Billerica, USA) which
was subsequently incubated with antibodies specific for
ER (Thermo Scientific) The membrane was reprobed
with the anti-Hsc70 antibody (Santa Cruz, Heidelberg,
Germany) overnight which served as a loading control.
Detection of the proteins was carried out using peroxidaseconjugated secondary antibodies (Dako, Glostrup,
Denmark) and the chemiluminescence ECL detection
solution (200 µM coumaric acid, 1.25 mM luminol,
0.0009% H2O2 in 100 mM Tris pH 8.5).

transfection MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells were
grown in starvation media (DMEM with 0.5% FCS
and 2 mM L-glutamine) for 24 hours prior to their
detachment. Cells were resuspended in 400 µl starvation
media and 100,000 cells per well were added to the
insert. Medium containing 10% FCS was added to each
well, and cells were allowed to migrate and invade
for 24 hours at 37°C. Inserts and wells were washed
with 1x washing buffer (Trevigen), and migrated or
invaded cells were incubated in 500 µl dissociation
buffer containing 0.83 µg Calcein-AM (Trevigen) for
1 hour. Fluorescence (excitation: 485 nm, emission:
535 nm) was measured by the LB 940 Mithras microplate
reader (Berthold Technologies, Bad Wildbach,
Germany).

Luciferase assay
For
transient
transfection,
the
3′UTR
of ER containing three miR-373 binding sites
(5′-CTAGCTAGAGACCCAGGCCTGGAGAGTAGACA
TTTTGCCTCTGATAAGCACTTTTTAAATTTCTAAG
TAATTGCTGCCTCTATTATGGCACTTCAATTTTGCA
CTT-3′) was cloned into a pCR2.1 TOPO vector
(Invitrogen), digested with the restriction enzymes XbaI
and NheI (New England Biolabs) and subcloned into the
corresponding restriction sites of the pmirGLO DualLuciferase miRNA Target plasmid (Promega, Mannheim,
Germany). The Luciferase assay was performed using the
Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay (Promega) according
to the manufacturer’s protocol. Luciferase activity was
measured on a 20/20n Luminometer Turner Biosystems
(Promega) and normalized by the Renilla luciferase
activity. Each transfection experiment was carried out in
duplicate wells and repeated two times.

MTT assay
To measure cell proliferation, non-transfected and
cells transfected with miR-373 expression plasmid, mimic
or inhibitor, for 24, 48 and 72 hours were incubated with
20 µL 5 mg/ml MTT (thiazolyl blue tetrazolium bromide,
Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS on a 96-well plate at 37°C
for 3 hours. Following incubation the cells were lysed
with lyses buffer (4 mM HCl, 0.1% NP40 in isopropanol).
A  microplate reader (Tecan, Männedorf, Switzerland)
was used to measure the OD values at 540 nm. Each
experimental group contained three replicate wells, and
the experiment was repeated three times.

Statistical analysis
The statistical analyses were performed using
the SPSS software package, version 20.0 (SPSS Inc.
Chicago, IL). Because of skewed distributions of the miRs
concentrations, differences in group levels were bivariately
assessed by the Mann-Whitney-U-test. Moreover,
statistical differences were calculated using ANOVA with
Tukey’s HSD test for all pairwise comparisons that correct
for experiment-wise error rate. Missing data were handled
by pairwise deletion. A p-value <0.05 was considered as
statistically significant. All p-values are two-sided. Due to
the explorative nature of the study no formal adjustment
for multiple testing was performed.

Apoptosis assay and flow cytometry
To induce apoptosis, 24 hour after transfection
MCF-7 cells on a 6-well plate were treated with 4.8 µM
of the topoisomerase I inhibitor camptothecin (Biovision,
Milpitas, USA) for 4 hours. Twenty-four hours after
induction of apoptosis, the non-transfected and transfected
cells were incubated with 3 µL Annexin-V-FITC (BD
Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA) and 5 µL propidium
iodide (Sigma-Aldrich) in the dark at 4°C for 15 min.
Following incubation 400 µL Annexin-FITC binding
buffer (0.1 M Hepes pH 7.4, 1.4 M NaCl, 25 mM CaCl2 in
PBS) was added to the cells. The cells were then analyzed
on a FACS CantoII flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). For
bright field pictures the Axiovert 200 microscope (Carl
Zeiss, Jena, Germany) with a 10x magnification was used.
