ABSTRACT
The functional role of AF1q/MLLT11, an oncogenic factor involved in a
translocation t(1;11)(q21;q23) responsible for acute myeloid leukaemia, has been
investigated in hematological and solid malignancies and its expression was found to
be linked to tumor progression and poor clinical outcome. In addition to its oncogenic
function, AF1q has been shown to play a role in the onset of basal and drug-induced
apoptosis in cancer cells of different histotypes, including ovarian cancer. Through
in vitro, ex vivo, and in silico approaches, we demonstrated here that AF1q is also
endowed with protumorigenic potential in ovarian cancer. In ovarian cancer cell lines,
stable AF1q overexpression caused activation of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition
and increased motility/migratory/invasive abilities accompanied by gene expression
changes mainly related to Wnt signaling and to signaling pathways involving in ERK/
p38 activation. The potential role of AF1q in ovarian cancer progression was confirmed
by immunohistochemical and in silico analyses performed in ovarian tumor specimens
which revealed that the protein was absent in normal ovarian epithelium and became
detectable when atypical proliferation was present. Moreover, AF1q was significantly
lower in borderline ovarian tumors (i.e., tumors of low malignant potential without
stromal invasion) than in invasive tumors, thus corroborating the association between
high AF1q expression and increased migratory/invasive cell behavior and confirming
its potential role in ovarian cancer progression. Our findings demonstrated, for the
first time, that AF1q is endowed with protumorigenic activity in ovarian cancer, thus
highlighting a dual behavior (i.e., protumorigenic and proapoptotic functions) of the
protein in the malignancy.

factor implicated in a translocation t(1;11)(q21;q23)
involved in the development of acute myeloid leukaemia

(AML). Moreover, the AF1q locus has been involved
in complex events of translocation and duplication in
other hematological malignancies [2, 3]. In the absence
of specific cytogenetic alterations, elevated AF1q mRNA
expression has been reported in lymphoid and myeloid
malignancies [2, 4, 5] and has been associated with a poor
prognosis in pediatric AML and also in adult patients with
myelodysplastic syndrome [6, 7]. An oncogenic function
of AF1q has been reported also in certain solid tumors,
such as thyroid oncocytic and testicular germ cell tumors
[8, 9] and, in breast cancer, it has been shown to promote
distant metastasis [10–12], although the molecular
mechanisms underlying this function have not yet been
fully elucidated. Important advances in understanding
the biological functions of AF1q associated with breast
cancer metastasis have recently been obtained by Park
and colleagues [12, 13]. The authors demonstrated that
AF1q acts as cofactor for both Wnt and STAT signaling
pathways, via direct interaction with T-cell-factor-7 and
activation of Src-platelet-derived growth factor subunit
B kinase cascade, respectively. In both cases, the binding
of AF1q to transcription factors results in transcriptional
activation of genes required for tumorigenesis and
metastasis.
In addition to AF1q oncogenic functions, there
is also evidence of a role as an apoptosis mediator in
hepatocellular, ovarian and squamous carcinoma and in
promyelocytic leukemia cells [14–16]. Thus, similarly to
that reported for certain oncogenes (i.e., Myc and Ras) [17],
AF1q has been shown to be endowed with a dual function
in malignancy, being a protein apparently involved in both
promotion and inhibition of cancer progression.
To gain further insight into the role of AF1q in
tumorigenesis of solid malignancies, we investigated
the protumorigenic potential of the protein in ovarian
cancer. The malignancy is the fifth most common female
cancer, with an incidence of about 3% of all cancers in
women, and epithelial ovarian cancer is the most common
type, accounting for 90% of all ovarian neoplasms [18].
Despite the considerable advances made in ovarian
cancer management and the intensive efforts to elucidate
predisposing factors, the malignancy remains one with
the lowest survival rates, with a mortality rate higher than
any other cancer of the female reproductive system. Rapid
disease progression and metastasis development represent
critical factors for a poor clinical outcome and cancer
mortality. In fact, due to the absence of symptoms in the
early stages of the disease, most patients are diagnosed
when tumors have local or distant spread [18].
We herein report, for the first time, that AF1q
plays a role in promoting epithelial-to-mesenchymal
transition (EMT) and the acquisition of an invasive and
aggressive behavior of cultured ovarian cancer cells and
that elevated expression of the protein is associated with
clinical aggressiveness and progression in ovarian cancer
specimens.

Sustained AF1q overexpression induces a
spindle-shape phenotype and cytoskeleton
rearrangement in A2780 ovarian cancer cells
In addition to the oncogenic function of AF1q
described in hematological as well as in solid malignancies
[6–11,19], some studies have shown that elevated
expression levels of the protein were associated to
increased apoptosis in cancer cells [14–16]. In the present
study, we investigated whether the protein is also endowed
with an oncogenic potential in ovarian cancer. The A2780
ovarian cancer cell line was stably transfected with a
Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP)-tagged AF1q expression
plasmid previously shown to increase apoptosis when
transiently transfected in the cell line [16]. After geneticin
selection, resistant clones were isolated and analyzed by
western blot to confirm the presence of the AF1q-GFP
protein. Figure 1A reports the results of two representative
clones (A and B) which presented higher expression of the
recombinant protein than that expressed by the mock clone
(empty vector). Overexpression of the AF1q-GFP protein
caused a dramatic change in cell morphology from a round
and cuboidal cell shape to a long, spindle, fibroblast-like
cell appearance (Figure 1B). To be sure that the observed
changes of cell phenotype were attributable to the increased
expression of AF1q and not to an unwanted alteration of
protein functions due to the fusion of AF1q (9 kDa) to
GFP (36 kDa), new stable transfectants were established
using an expression vector (pcDNA 3.1) containing the
AF1q open reading frame without GFP. Figure 1C reports
the results of western blot analysis of two representative
clones (Cl.8 and 9) showing AF1q overexpression relative
to mock clone or A2780 parental cells. Similarly to that
observed in clones A and B, AF1q stable Cl.8 and Cl.9
displayed a phenotype more elongated and a spindle-like
shape than that of the mock clone (Figure 1D). Since AF1qGFP and AF1q-overexpressing clones showed very similar
morphological features, we can exclude that the effect was
caused by the fusion protein AF1q-GFP. The following
analyses were performed only in Cl.8 and Cl.9 clones.
To further characterize the morphological alterations
induced by AF1q overexpression, the arrangement
of filamentous actin (F-actin) and vimentin fibers
contributing to the cytoskeletal structure were analyzed.
Immunofluorescence analysis revealed that AF1qoverexpressing clones displayed a modified organization
of both filaments, showing a remarkable increase in
membrane actin ruffles and a reorganization of vimentin,
from short and focally localized fibers to a long, dense,
and parallel network (Figure 2, data shown only for Cl.8).
Such results indicated that stable AF1q overexpression in
A2780 cells induced a morphological alteration, leading to
a spindle-like phenotype, and cytoskeleton reorganization
that may be suggestive of an increased migratory capacity.

AF1q overexpression promotes cell motility,
migration and invasion of A2780 ovarian cancer
cells

migration and invasion of AF1q-overexpressing clones
were increased compared to those of control cells (Figure
3B). Specifically, migration of Cl.8 and Cl.9 was ~4 and
~6 fold higher than that of the mock clone (p = 0.027 and
0.015, respectively), whereas invasion was enhanced by
~4 and ~7 fold, respectively, that of the mock clone (Cl.9:
p = 0.024, whereas the increase was not statistically
significant for Cl.8: p = 0.24) (Figure 3C). Such results
indicated that stable overexpression of AF1q increased the
motility and migratory/invasive abilities of A2780 cells.
The spindle-shaped morphology and the increased
migratory/invasive capacity acquired by A2780 cells
stably transfected with AF1q may be indicative of
EMT. Consistent with this hypothesis, Real-Time PCR

The effect of AF1q stable overexpression in cell
migration was assessed by performing wound-healing
and transwell assays. The wound-healing assays showed
that, after 24 as well as 48 h from the monolayer scratch,
Cl.8 and Cl.9 cells were both able to close the wound
more efficiently than were the mock cells (Figure 3A)
(Cl.8: p = 0.013 and 0.049 at 24 and 48 h, respectively;
Cl.9: p = 0.006 and 0.002 at 24 and 48 h, respectively).
Similar results were obtained when migration ability
was tested through transwell assays, which showed that

analyses revealed that Cl.8 and Cl.9 cells, compared to
mock cells, both displayed an increased expression of the
EMT-related transcription factors Snai1, Snai2 and Zeb1
(Figure 4A). Moreover, Western blot analysis showed
that AF1q-overexpressing clones were concomitantly
characterized by a reduced expression of the epithelial
markers, cytokeratins 8 and 18, and increased expression
of the mesenchymal markers vimentin and fibronectin
(Figure 4A). In this particular cell line, we could not
evaluate EMT activation based on the down-regulation of
E-cadherin, the classical hallmark of the process, because
A2780 cells did not express the protein (data not shown).
Acquisition of mesenchymal traits by tumor cells
has been associated not only to invasive/metastatic ability
but also to drug resistance. Since in ovarian cancer a
link between EMT and resistance to platinum-based
chemotherapy has been reported [20], we investigated
whether AF1q overexpression caused change in cell
sensitivity to the drug. As shown in Figure 4B, Cl.8
and Cl.9 cells, compared to mock cells, both displayed
a decreased sensitivity to cisplatin growth inhibitory
activity: a 50% growth inhibition was achieved with
0.46 µM cisplatin in mock cells, whereas the IC50 values
(concentrations required for 50% growth inhibition)
of this drug were 2.2 and 2 µM for Cl.8 and Cl.9 cells,
respectively.
Taken together, the in vitro experiments conducted
on A2780 cells might suggest an involvement of AF1q in
ovarian tumor progression and resistance to chemotherapy.

induced by AF1q overexpression in A2780 cells. Gene
expression profiles of Cl.9 and mock cells were compared
by microarray analysis and 1804 genes (i.e., 916 upregulated and 888 down-regulated in Cl.9 cells; adj
p-value < 0.001 and at least a two-fold difference between
the two conditions) were found differentially expressed
(Supplementary Figure 1). Interesting observations
emerged by looking at single gene level (the top 25 up and
down-regulated genes are listed in Supplementary Table
1). For example, among the top up-regulated genes, we
found genes playing a role in invasiveness and metastasis
(i.e., MMP3 [21] and MMP10 [22, 23], SOX18 [24],
MARCKS [25], CD36 [26] and BST2 [27]). A marked
up-regulation of AKR1 enzymes (AKR1C2, AKR1C3
and AKR1C4) which are involved in steroid hormones
metabolism [28], including estrogen biosynthesis, was
also observed. Intriguingly, the second most up-regulated
gene by AF1q transfection was S100A4. This gene is a
direct target of β-catenin/T-cell factor signaling, playing
an important role in the acquisition of aggressive
characteristics in ovarian carcinomas [29]. S100A4 has
been shown to act as a master mediator of EMT and to
modulate the sensitivity to anticancer drugs, including
cisplatin [30]. Real-Time PCR analysis of S100A4
expression, extended also to Cl.8, confirmed its marked
increase in AF1q transfected cells, compared to mock
cells (Figure 4C). On the other hand, genes suppressing
migration (DIRAS3 [31]) and metastasis (RBM47 [32]
and CRB3 [33]) were found among the most downregulated genes.
AF1q-induced changes in gene expression were
then analyzed by Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA),
using the Hallmark Gene Set Collection [34]. Positively
(n = 9) and negatively (n = 1) enriched gene sets (FDR
< 0.25) are listed in Supplementary Table 2, and selected
gene set enrichment plots are shown in Figure 5A and 5B.

Gene expression analysis confirmed a role of
AF1q in EMT and indicated Wnt signaling and
MAPK cascade as AF1q mediators
To explore the molecular pathways involved in
AF1q activity, we analyzed the changes in gene expression

Not surprisingly, the EMT gene set was positively enriched
in AF1q transfected cells (Figure 5A). At the same time,
a set of genes typically expressed in the apical surface
of epithelial cells was negatively enriched (Figure 5B).
These findings are fully consistent with the acquisition of
mesenchymal traits in culture. A positive enrichment was
also found for genes in the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. This
observation was in line with the above mentioned S100A4
induction and with the recent identification of AF1q

as a TCF7/LEF1 co-factor acting downstream the Wnt
signaling pathway in breast cancer metastatization [12].
Interestingly, also gene sets related to Ras signaling,
hypoxia and estrogen response were positively enriched
in AF1q transfected cells (Figure 5A). Besides their
common involvement in EMT, invasion and metastasis
processes, several studies reported that these pathways are
linked to the activation of the mitogen-activated protein
kinases (MAPKs) ERK and p38 [35–37]. Therefore, we

investigated whether AF1q overexpression led to ERK
and p38 activation in A2780 cells, determining their
phosphorylation status. Western blot using phosphospecific antibodies detecting the phosphorylated
(active) forms of the kinases showed increased kinase
phosphorylation in Cl.8 and Cl.9 compared to mock cells
(Figure 5C).

expression level a role of AF1q in EMT and in tumor

cells, which have undetectable AF1q expression, were
stably transfected with AF1q. After geneticin selection,
two resistant clones (Cl.1 and Cl.2) were isolated and
analyzed by Western blot, which confirmed the presence
of the protein (Figure 6A). Similarly to that observed
in A2780 cells, AF1q overexpression conferred an
elongated morphology to OVCAR-5 cells (Supplementary
Figure 2) and acquisition of mesenchymal markers. In fact,
enforced AF1q expression resulted in down-regulation
of E-cadherin, in increased N-cadherin, vimentin and
fibronectin as well as Snai1 and Snai2 mRNA levels
(Figure 6A). According to the EMT-promoting function
of AF1q observed in A2780 and OVCAR-5 cells,
suppression of endogenous AF1q expression in TOV21G cells resulted in a decrease of mesenchymal markers
(Figure 6B), although no evident changes in morphology
were observed (data not shown). These findings indicated
that the role of AF1q in EMT was not restricted to A2780
cells but could be reliably considered as a more general
mechanism.

AF1q is involved in EMT transition in
OVCAR-5 and TOV-21G ovarian cancer cells
To assess whether AF1q involvement in the EMT
process was restricted to A2780 cells or represented
a distinctive function of the gene in ovarian cancer
cells, we extended our analysis to two other ovarian
cancer cell lines, OVCAR-5 and TOV-21G. OVCAR-5

Finally, we investigated whether the acquisition
of epithelial traits caused per se a decrease in AF1q
expression level. To this aim TOV-21G and A2780
cells were transiently co-transfected with miR-200c
and miR-141, two members of the miR-200 family, a
master regulator of MET targeting ZEB1 3′UTR [38],
a repressor of the E-cadherin transcription [39]. After
ascertain that miRNA transfection resulted in increased
levels of miR-200c and miR-141 (Supplementary
Figure 3A), we verified that, as expected, the expression
level of ZEB1 and E-cadherin were decreased and
increased, respectively (Supplementary Figure 3B). In
both cell lines the acquisition of epithelial traits did not
affect AF1q expression (Supplementary Figure 3B), thus
suggesting that AF1q acts as an upstream regulator of
EMT rather than an effector molecule.

showed an AF1q positive immunostaining in tumor
epithelial cells of serous, endometrioid, clear cells, and
undifferentiated carcinomas, but not of the mucinous
type. In particular, serous and endometroid carcinomas
showed AF1q expression higher than the other histotypes
(Figure 7A and Table 1). In AF1q-positive specimens, the
immunostaining was present in tumor cells, predominantly
localized in the cytoplasm and characterized by a granular
pattern. By contrast, AF1q expression was undetectable in
stroma and in normal ovarian surface epithelium (OSE)
(Figure 7B). However, in specific areas of OSE, showing
stratified epithelial proliferation characterized by mitotic
activity and nuclear atypia, AF1q staining was detectable
(data not shown). No statistically significant differences
were found between AF1q expression levels and tumor
stage or grade. In this analysis, stage III (i.e., cancer
has spread to the peritoneum outside the pelvis and/or
metastatized to the retroperitoneal lymph nodes) and stage
IV (i.e., cancer has spread to distant sites) were grouped
together due to the paucity of stage IV cases (n = 3). On
the contrary, looking at the pathological classification
in type I and type II ovarian cancers, a statistically

significant association between type II ovarian cancers and
high AF1q expression levels was observed (p = 0.0447,
Table 1). Type I tumors are generally slow-growing,
confined to the ovary and comprise: low-grade serous,
low-grade endometrioid, clear-cell, mucinous, and
transitional tumors. Type II tumors are typically highly
aggressive, rapidly proliferating and associated with
a poor prognosis; they include: high-grade serous and
endometrioid carcinomas and undifferentiated carcinomas.
Since the results might suggest an association
between high AF1q protein expression and tumor
aggressiveness, we extended IHC analyses to 8 serous

borderline ovarian tumors (BOT, i.e., tumors with low
malignant potential) characterized by intermediate
pathological and clinical features between benign and
malignant ovarian tumors (such as cytoplasmic and
nuclear atypia and the absence of stromal invasion) [40].
The tumors showed AF1q staining but most of them
(5/8) displayed a significantly lower protein expression
level than that of invasive serous tumors (Table 2 and
Figure 8 upper panel, p = 0.0276). In addition, opposite
to what observed in invasive tumors, in 4/8 BOT the
protein staining was heterogeneous, with negative and
positive areas (or different reaction intensity) in the same

case (Figure 8 middle panel). Interestingly, in normal
proliferating epithelium (i.e., OSE, cortical inclusion
cysts, and cystic adenoma) as well as in the areas of BOT
without evidence of atypical epithelium, the protein was
undetectable (Figure 8 lower panel), whereas in the areas
of transition between normal epithelium and atypical
epithelial proliferation, the protein became detectable
(Figure 8 lower panel). All this data together suggested
that AF1q level could be related to tumor aggressiveness
and might play a role in the ovarian tumorigenic process.

The relationship between AF1q expression and
ovarian tumor aggressiveness was further investigated
in silico by evaluating its expression level in the Tothill
dataset [41] initially focusing on gene expression profiles
of invasive ovarian tumors (both serous and endometrioid
histotypes). In agreement with IHC analyses, no
statistically significant differences were found between

that up-regulation of AF1q might be involved in the
progression from BOT to invasive disease and acquisition
of an invasive phenotype; however, variations in AF1q
expression within high grade tumors did not correlate
with an increased risk of development of metastasis, as
suggested by the lack of association with tumor stage and
patient outcome.

AF1q expression and tumor stage (p = 0.292, considering
each stage separately, Supplementary Figure 4A). On the
contrary, we found a significant association between AF1q
expression and tumor grade (p = 0.031; Supplementary
Figure 4B).
We finally investigated whether AF1q expression
levels were associated with patients’ outcome, but no
significant association was found neither in univariable
analysis nor after adjusting or stratifying for the debulking
status after surgery (Supplementary Table 3).
Analysis of the Tothill dataset was then extended
to BOT. This group showed a statistically significant
lower AF1q expression compared to invasive tumors
(p = 0.0024; Figure 9A). The result was further confirmed
in an independent dataset generated by Berchuck et al.

DISCUSSION

of certain antitumor agents, such as gamma irradiation and
doxorubicin [14, 15]. According to this alternative AF1q
function, our group recently reported that its transient
overexpression (either drug-induced or obtained by AF1q
ectopic expression) caused apoptosis induction in ovarian
cancer cells [16]. Thus, AF1q may be ascribed as a protein
endowed with a dual behavior, being characterized by both
proapoptotic and protumorigenic functions.
In an attempt to clarify this intriguing issue, we
investigated whether AF1q, besides its involvement
in apoptosis induction, was also endowed with
protumorigenic potential in ovarian cancer cells. To
this aim, we evaluated the effects of AF1q stable
overexpression in the A2780 human ovarian cancer cell
line, in order to assess the putative AF1q function in the
same cellular context in which we found that its transient
transfection induced apoptosis [16].
Our in vitro results clearly indicated an association
between stable AF1q overexpression and increased
tumor aggressiveness and suggested an involvement
of the protein in the progression of ovarian cancer. In

The present study investigated, for the first time,
the oncogenic potential of AF1q in ovarian cancer. We
provided evidence that sustained AF1q overexpression
increased the aggressive behavior of ovarian cancer cells
in vitro and that AF1q expression was positively correlated
with tumor aggressiveness in clinical ovarian cancer
specimens.
The biological activity of AF1q has not yet been
clarified; however, based on its first identification as a
fusion partner of the mixed-lineage leukaemia protein [1]
and considering its involvement in various chromosomal
rearrangements in hematopoietic malignancies [2, 4–7, 19],
the gene has originally been regarded as an oncogenic factor.
Moreover, the notion has been corroborated by other clinical
and experimental observations that link the overexpression
of AF1q to high tumor aggressiveness and to tumor
progression, even in the absence of specific chromosomal
aberrations [8, 10–12]. On the other hand, AF1q has been
recognized as a protein that mediates the apoptotic activities

fact, stable enforced AF1q expression conferred a more
aggressive phenotype to A2780 ovarian cancer cells,
displaying an elongated shape coupled with modifications
in cytoskeleton organization (i.e., distribution pattern of
vimentin and actin fibers) and an increase in motility and
migratory/invasive abilities. Such features were consistent
with distinct molecular alterations that occur during
EMT as indicated by the up-regulation of EMT-related
transcription factors (Snai1, Snai2 and Zeb1), the reduced
expression of epithelial markers (cytokeratins 8 and 18)
and the simultaneous up-regulation of mesenchymal
markers (vimentin and fibronectin). Through gain and
loss of AF1q function experiments in two other cell lines,
OVCAR-5 and TOV-21G, we obtained confirmation that
the role of the protein in EMT was not restricted to A2780
cells but could be reliably considered a more general
mechanism.
The present study was not specifically designed to
molecularly dissect the mechanisms underlying AF1qmediated effects, however, our findings provided some
initial insights into its interaction network in ovarian
cancer cells. Specifically, we found that AF1q expression
level was not affected when cells were forced to undergo
MET by transfection of two miR-200 family members
(miR-141 and miR-200c) that induced an epithelial
phenotype by targeting ZEB1 translation [38], a repressor
of E-cadherin [39]. This finding indicated that AF1q
was not regulated by ZEB1 but, more likely, acted as
an upstream regulator in the EMT process. In addition,
molecular pathways affected by AF1q were explored
by performing gene expression profiling and GSEA
after overexpression of the protein. Not surprisingly,
the analysis highlighted a role of AF1q in EMT, a key
biological process executed by tumor cells to increase
their aggressiveness and acquire invasive features [43].
Through the regulation of cell-cell and cell-matrix
adhesions, the phenomenon contributes to the plasticity of
ovarian cancer cells, thereby increasing their motility and
metastatic potential, and eventually contributing to poor
patient outcome [44–46]. In keeping with our findings, a
functional role of AF1q in tumor progression has also been
reported in human breast cancer [10–12]. In particular, in
a recent report, the protein was shown to induce a more
aggressive and metastatic behavior of breast cancer cell
lines, due, at least in part, to the enhancement of cell
motility and migratory/invasive abilities [12], acting
as a cofactor for Wnt and STAT signaling pathways. In
line with the described relationship between AF1q and
Wnt, our data revealed that AF1q overexpression in
ovarian tumor cells resulted in positive enrichment of
Wnt–β-catenin gene set and involved S100A4 gene, a
direct target of this signaling pathway involved in tumor
progression and metastasis formation, in ovarian tumor
[47]. Intriguingly, the decreased cisplatin sensitivity we
observed in AF1q-overexpressing ovarian cancer cells
is in line with the chemoresistance phenotype conferred
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

by the protein to breast cancer cells [12] and with the
knowledge that EMT plays a critical role in cancer drug
resistance [20]. It is also interesting to note that a specific
link between expression levels of S100A4 and cisplatin
sensitivity has been reported [22].
Gene expression analysis also showed a positive
enrichment of other gene sets, including Ras pathway,
response to hypoxia and to estrogen, previously described
to crosstalk with MAPK transduction cascade [35-37].
This finding prompted us to analyze MAPK activation
status revealing an increase in phosphorylation of ERK
and p38 proteins that could represent a potential additional
mechanism by which AF1q induces EMT in ovarian tumor
cells. However, whether AF1q directly or indirectly affects
the MAPK pathway requires further research.
Our in vitro evidence is corroborated by the results
obtained in ovarian cancer specimens, in which IHC and
in silico analyses for the expression of AF1q (protein
and mRNA, respectively) demonstrated a link between
high AF1q expression and tumor malignancy. In fact,
as assessed by IHC analysis, the AF1q staining was
undetectable in normal ovarian epithelium, becoming
positive when atypical proliferation was present.
Moreover, a differential AF1q expression (both at protein
and mRNA levels) between tumors with low malignant
potential (i.e., BOT) and invasive ovarian cancers was
observed, being significantly higher in the latter than in the
former. Interestingly, this particular result was especially
in line with in vitro findings associating the overexpression
of AF1q with the activation of the EMT process and the
acquisition of a more migratory/invasive behavior. In
fact, the main difference between BOT and malignant
ovarian tumors is represented by the different invasive
ability, since BOT are defined as non-invasive tumors.
It is noteworthy that the relationship between AF1q and
aggressive tumor behavior persisted taking into account
the pathological classification of type I and II ovarian
cancers. All these findings, coupled with the association
observed between AF1q level and tumor grade, supported
a potential role of AF1q in ovarian tumor progression.
According to our results, IHC analysis in breast cancer
specimens revealed that AF1q was not present in normal
epithelial cells and that its expression became detectable
in cancerous cells, being more intense in metastatic sites
[12]. In addition, in the same study, high AF1q expression
was found to be positively associated with poor overall,
disease-free, and metastasis-free survival of breast cancer
patients. However, we did not find a significant association
with tumor stage or patients’ outcome, suggesting that
AF1q role in ovarian cancer is primarily related with the
acquisition of an invasive phenotype in the primary tumor
rather than with a direct promotion of development of
distant metastasis. Accordingly, an in silico analysis of the
gene expression dataset GSE30587 [48] which included
18 samples from 9 matched pairs of primary ovarian
tumors and omentum metastases did not reveal statistically

significant differences in AF1q expression between the
two entities (data not shown).
The present study did not thoroughly investigate
the molecular events underlying AF1q protumorigenic
activity in ovarian cancer. Nevertheless, we can speculate
that, by acting as a co-factor [12, 13], AF1q could have
a pleiotropic influence on the transcription of multiple
genes through the interaction with different transcription
factors, thus allowing the switch between proapoptotic
and protumorigenic programs. In alternative to this
hypothesis, as previously described for certain wellcharacterized oncogenes [49], it is conceivable that the
induction of apoptosis upon oncogenic stimuli could be
a response evoked by cells as self-defense mechanism to
counteract aberrant cell growth. Such defense programs
have been shown to be activated as a result of the cellular
stress caused by aberrant oncogene activation as a
protective barrier to prevent the emergence of potentially
harmful cells [49]. Thus, escaping fail-safe mechanisms
could represent a determinant step in driving cell
transformation, tumor initiation and progression. In line
with this hypothesis, we cannot exclude that also the stable
AF1q transfection did not initially cause an induction of
apoptosis, possibly covered by the cell death provoked by
the antibiotic selection.
In conclusion, the present study demonstrated, for
the first time, that AF1q is endowed with protumorigenic
activity in ovarian cancer. Together with our previous
observations related to the proapoptotic function of the
protein, such findings highlighted a dual behavior of
AF1q in this malignancy. Taken together our results
demonstrated a role for AF1q in cellular migration and
invasion and in the acquisition of tumor invasive and
aggressive features, thus pointing out an involvement of
the protein in ovarian tumor progression. Understanding
the molecular bases underlying the role of AF1q in ovarian
tumor progression absolutely requires and deserves further
investigation, in order to determine whether targeting the
protein or its regulatory axis could be a useful therapeutic
strategy for the malignancy.

48 h before adding G418 (Gibco Brl, Paisley, UK) at a
concentration of 400 µg/ml for A2780 and OVCAR-5
cells or Puromycin (Sigma Aldrich, St Louis, MO) at a
concentration of 2.5 µg/ml for TOV-21G, used for the
selection of transfectant clones. miR-200c and miR141 mimics were transiently transfected in A2780 and
TOV-21G cells. Cells were seeded and transfected
according to the above mentioned transfection protocol
using 20 µM miR-200c mimic (Thermo Fisher) and 20
µM miR-141 mimic (Thermo Fisher) and analyzed after
72 hours.

AF1q expression and silencing plasmids
Two different constructs were used to overexpress
AF1q: a GFP-tagged AF1q expression vector
pEGFP-N1 constructed as described previously [16]
and AF1q1 full-length cDNA cloned into the expression
vector pcDNA3.1 (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). For
the latter, AF1q open reading frame was obtained by
Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) using forward primer
5′-GAATTCCCACCATGAGGGACCCTGTGA-3′
(containing ECORI restriction site and Kozak sequence
CCACC) and reverse primer  5′- CTCGAGTTAGAGCAA
GTCCAGTTCGAAG-3′ (containing Xho restriction site).
Plasmids expressing an AF1q shRNA and a scrambled
non-silencing siRNA were purchased from Origene
(Rockville, MD, #TF319110).

Growth inhibition assay
Cells were seeded at a density of 7000 cells per well
in 96 cluster tissue culture plates, treated the next day with
increasing concentrations of cisplatin (from 0.05 µM to
0.8 µM), and incubated for 72 hours. Cell growth
inhibition was estimated by using the sulforhodamine B
assay. Three analyses were performed, and four replicate
wells were used for each analysis. IC50 values were
calculated by interpolation of the sigmoidal dose response
curves.

migrate for 48 h and, after incubation, stationary cells were
removed from the upper surface of the membranes using
a cotton swab. The cells on the lower membrane surface
were fixed with ethanol and stained with sulforhodamine
B. The number of stained cells in five randomly chosen
fields was counted under a light microscope. The
experiment was repeated three times.

RNA extraction and real-time PCR
For gene expression Real-Time PCR analysis,
single-stranded cDNA was synthesized from 2 µg of total
cellular RNA extracted using Trizol reagent (Thermo
Fisher) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The
synthesis was performed by using the High Capacity
RNA-to-cDNA Kit (Thermo Fisher) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. EMT-related transcription
factors, such as Snai1, Snai2, Zeb1, Fn (fibronectin),
Cdh1 (E-cadherin) and Cdh2 (N-cadherin) levels were
analyzed by Real-Time PCR using specific TaqMan
assays (Applied Biosystems; assay IDs: Hs00195591_m1,
Hs00161904_m1, Hs00232783_m1, Hs01549976_m1,
hs01023894_m1 and Hs00983056_m1, respectively) and
the ABI PRISM 7900 HT Sequence Detection System
(Applied Biosystems). All the data were analyzed by
SDS 2.4 software (Applied Biosystems) and reported as
relative quantity (RQ) with respect to Mock1 expression
considered as calibrator sample using comparative
Ct method (ΔΔCt), in which GAPDH (assay ID:
Hs02758991_g) expression was used to normalize raw Ct
data (obtaining ΔCt).
For Real-Time PCR analysis of miR-141 and miR200c, complementary DNA was synthesized from 5 ng of
total RNA, after extraction with the commercial columnbased system Qiagen miRNeasy® Mini Kit (Qiagen,
Valencia, CA, USA), using the TaqMan microRNA
Reverse Transcription Reagents (Thermo Fisher)
according to the manufacturer’s instruction and using
assay 000463 and 002300 (Thermo Fisher). Data analyses
was performed using ΔΔCt method in which U6 (assay ID:
001973) expression was used as internal calibrator.

Immunofluorescence analysis
Cells, grown on glass coverslips slides in 24 mm
Petri dishes, were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde at room
temperature for 10 minutes, permeabilized with 0.2%
Triton X-100 at room temperature for 5 minutes, washed
with PBS and then stained with fluorescent phalloidin
(Sigma Aldrich) or Vimentin (Abcam) followed by the
secondary antibody anti-mouse Alexa 488 (Molecular
Probes, Eugene, OR). Slides were fitted with Fluoroshield
mounting medium with DAPI (Abcam) and analyzed with
a fluorescence microscope [images were recorded with a
Spot Insight digital camera (Delta Sistemi, Rome, Italy)
equipped with a system of image analysis (IAS 2000;
Delta Sistemi)].

Wound-healing assay
Cells (1.5 × 106) were plated in six-well plates,
grown until they reached approximately 90% confluence,
and starved for 24 h in serum free medium. The culture
medium was then removed and the cell monolayer was
wounded with a sterile pipette tip and washed twice with
PBS. Subsequently, fresh culture medium supplemented
with 1% of serum was added, and the cells were allowed
to close the wound for 48 h. Photographs of the same
wound position were taken over time after scratching
and the migration ability of the cells was determined by
measuring the width of the wound. The experiment was
performed in triplicate.

Microarray experiments and data processing

Cell migration and invasion assays

Total RNA, after a clean-up treatment with
RNAeasy kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and with RNasefree DNase to remove contaminating genomic DNA, was
assessed for integrity and purity by Bioanalyzer (Agilent,
Santa Clara,CA).
RNA samples were processed for microarray
hybridization by the Functional Genomics core facility
at the Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori
of Milan. Briefly, 500 ng of total RNA was reverse
transcribed, labeled with biotin and amplified overnight
using the Illumina RNA TotalPrep Amplification kit
(Ambion) according to manufacturer’s protocol. One ug of

Both migration and invasion assays were performed
in 24-well dishes using Transwell inserts with 8-µm
sized pores (Corning Costar, NY). In the case of invasion
assay, filters were pre-coated with 60 µL Matrigel (BD
Biosciences, Bedford, MA) for 30 minutes. After 24 h
of starvation, cells were trypsinized and re-suspended in
serum-free medium at a density of 0.4 × 106 cells/ml, and
300 µl of this cell suspension was seeded to the upper side
of the filters and 1 ml of serum-supplemented medium was
placed in the lower chamber (for invasion assay the density
used was 0.8 × 106 cells/ml). Cells were permitted to

the biotinylated cRNA sample was mixed with the Hyb E1
hybridizatioin buffer containing 37.5% (w/w) formamide
and then hybridized to Illumina HumanHT-12v4 chips
(47,324 probes) (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, CA) at 58°C
overnight. Array chips were washed with manufacturer’s
E1BC solution, stained with 1 ug/ml Cy3-streptavidine
(Amersham Biosciences) and eventually scanned with
Illumina BeadArray Reader. We collected primary data
using the supplied scanner software and the following
analyses were performed using the BeadStudio Version 3
software package. Raw data was normalized using the RSN
normalization as implemented in the lumi R/Bioconductor
package. Probes with detection p value > 0.01 in all
samples were discarded before downstream analyses.
Enrichment analysis in mRNA expression data after
AF1q stable transfection in A2780 cells was performed
using GSEA [51]. The Hallmark collection containing
50 gene sets, representing well-defined biological
pathways and states, was tested for enrichment. Gene
expression was ranked according to fold change. Gene sets
with a FDR < 0.25 were considered significantly enriched.

working dilution 1:25 overnight at 4°C. The secondary
antibody used was a Biotinylated Secondary Antibody
(Dako REAL™ Link; Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) for
15 minute at room temperature and addition of the highsensitivity streptavidin-HRP conjugate (Dako REAL™
Streptavidin Peroxidase) was performed for 15 minutes.
The sections were treated with 3.3′-diaminobenzidine
tetrahydrochloride chromogen (Dako REAL™ DAB)
for 5 minutes. Nuclei were counterstained with
hematoxylin. Lymphoid tissue of thymus was used as an
external positive control. The negative control sample
(primary antibody omitted) did not show any signal.
Immunohistochemical reaction for AF1q was assessed
using a semi quantitative score, based on the percentage
of positive cells and staining intensity of the reaction. The
percentage of positive cells of each sample was scored
based on cytoplasmic staining (< 5% or > 5%). Only the
samples with staining >5% were considered as tumor
expressions. The intensity of cytoplasmic staining of
samples was graded into three groups: weak (+), moderate
(++) and strong (+++). Based on positive cells and their
staining intensity the samples were divided into two
groups: low (i.e., negative (0–5%) or > 5% positive cells
and weak intensity) and high (i.e., >5% positive cells and
moderate or strong intensity).

Patient specimens
We analyzed 47 specimens from previously
untreated patients with invasive ovarian cancer, selected
from the Gynecologic Oncology Unit of the Fondazione
IRCCS Istituto Nazionale dei  Tumori of Milan (from
2004 to 2009) and from the “Sf. Spiridon” Clinical
Emergency County Hospital and “Cuza-Vodă” Obstetrics
and Gynecology University Hospital of Iassy (from 2009
to 2011) (Table 1). We also included in our analysis
8 specimens from patients with stage I serous BOT selected
from the case series of the former Institute. The study
was approved by the respective local ethics committees,
and patients signed an informed consent to donate the
leftover biological material for research studies. Patient
records were reviewed: histologic subtypes were evaluated
according to the dualistic model (type I and type II),
tumor stages were assessed according to the International
Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) standards
and tumor grade by the WHO classification.

In silico analysis
The in silico analyses were performed on Tothill
[23] and Berchuck [24] datasets, which are the two largest
publicly available ovarian cancer datasets including both
invasive tumors (representative of the different stages and
grades) and BOT. Raw data from the Tothill dataset was
downloaded from the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus
repository (GSE9891), and the Berchuck dataset was
downloaded from the Duke Institute website (www.duke.
edu). The former dataset, which was obtained using the
Affymetrix platform, was RMA normalized using the
proprietary Expression Console software. Upon quality
control, for each dataset the probe corresponding to AF1q
(i.e., the 211071_s_at) in the current annotation version
(na34, www.affymetrix.com) was extracted and the analyses
were performed through GraphPad Prism version 5.

Immunohistochemical analysis

Statistical analysis

Paraffin-embedded formalin-fixed ovarian cancer
tissues were sectioned (4 mm thick). Unstained sections
were de-waxed and rehydrated. For epitope unmasking,
a sodium citrate 10 mM (pH 6.0) procedure based
on autoclave treatment for 15 minutes was applied.
Blocking of the endogenous peroxidase for 10 minutes
was performed by using H2O2 and 3% methanol.
Incubation with the primary antibody anti-MLTT11/
AF1q (Epitomics, Burlingame, CA) was done with a

Experiments were carried out at least in triplicate.
Differences between mean values were assessed by
two-tailed Student’s t-test and Fisher’s exact test and
one-way ANOVA. p values < 0.05 were considered as
statistically significant. Univariable and multivariable
Cox regression analysis (as implemented in the survival R
package)  was  used to correlate AF1q and/or clinicopathological variables with survival.
