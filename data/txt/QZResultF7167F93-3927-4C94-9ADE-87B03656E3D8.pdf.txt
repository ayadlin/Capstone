Abstract

Author Manuscript

Nuclear LASP-1 has a direct correlation with overall survival of breast cancer patients. In this
study, immunohistochemical analysis of a human breast TMA showed that LASP-1 is absent in
normal human breast epithelium but the expression increases with malignancy and is highly
nuclear in aggressive breast cancer. We investigated whether the chemokines and growth factors
present in the tumor microenvironment could trigger nuclear translocation of LASP-1.Treatment
of human breast cancer cells with CXCL12, EGF and Heregulin and HMEC-CXCR2 cells with
CXCL8 facilitated nuclear shuttling of LASP-1. Data from the biochemical analysis of the nuclear
and cytosolic fractions further confirmed the nuclear translocation of LASP-1 upon chemokine
and growth factor treatment. CXCL12-dependent nuclear import of LASP-1 could be blocked by
CXCR4 antagonist, AMD-3100. Knock down of LASP-1 resulted in alterations in gene expression
leading to an increased level of cell junction and extracellular matrix proteins and an altered
cytokine secretory profile. Three dimensional cultures of human breast cancer cells on Matrigel
revealed an altered colony growth, morphology and arborization pattern in LASP-1 knock down
cells. Functional analysis of the LASP-1 knock down cells revealed increased adhesion to collagen
IV and decreased invasion through the Matrigel. Proteomics analysis of immunoprecipitates of
LASP-1 and subsequent validation approaches revealed that LASP-1associated with the epigenetic
machinery especially UHRF1, DNMT1, G9a and the transcription factor Snail1. Interestingly,
LASP-1 associated with UHRF1, G9a, Snail1 and di- and tri-methylated histoneH3 in a CXCL12dependent manner based on immunoprecipitation and proximity ligation assays. LASP-1 also

Introduction

Author Manuscript

LASP-1 (LIM and SH3 protein-1) is a scaffold protein that mediates cell migration,
proliferation and survival in several human breast cancer cell lines (1). Silencing of LASP-1
in breast cancer cells inhibits cell migration and proliferation by 40% (2, 3). LASP-1 is
organized into modular LIM, NR and SH3 domains and these domains interact with a
variety of proteins. Previously, we discovered that LASP-1 directly binds to chemokine
receptors CXCR1, CXCR2, CXCR3 and CXCR4 through its LIM domain (4) that are
involved in directed migration of tumor and stromal cells (5, 6). This directional migration
and local invasion facilitates the metastasis of breast cancer cells. Through its direct binding
to the chemokine receptors, LASP-1 could be involved in modulating the signaling pathways
evoked by these chemokine receptors and thus possibly provides a key potential target for
interrupting the roles of CXCR2 (4, 7–9), CXCR4 (10–14) and CXCR3 (15–17) in primary
and metastatic breast cancer.

Author Manuscript

A previous study showed that an elevated expression of LASP-1 in breast epithelial cells
correlated with increased malignancy, tumor grade and lymph node status (18). This may
suggest a role for LASP-1 in breast cancer progression and metastasis. Interestingly, nuclear
LASP-1 (nLASP-1) is evident in 31% of LASP1-positive invasive breast cancer samples.
Importantly, the nLASP-1 status and the 10-year survival rate are inversely correlated (19).
Unraveling the mechanism by which nLASP-1 is linked to poor patient outcome may
provide new key targets for treatment of subsets of breast cancer.

Author Manuscript

The tumor microenvironment is enriched with chemokines and growth factors. We tested
whether the chemokines and growth factors present in the tumor microenvironment would
potentially trigger the nuclear translocation of LASP-1. A role in chromatin remodeling for
nLASP-1 has been suggested in human breast cancer, but at this time remain
uncharacterized. Our data demonstrate for the first time that upon stimulation of human
breast cancer cells with the chemokines CXCL12, CXCL8, and the growth factors epidermal
growth factor (EGF) and heregulin (HRG) resulted in a shuttling of LASP-1 to the nucleus.
By employing a variety of approaches, we discovered that LASP-1 associates with several
novel proteins involved in epigenetic regulation of gene expression (20, 21). Moreover, we
report here that LASP-1 directly binds to Snail1 and nLASP-1 may serve as a hub for
several proteins involved in epigenetic regulation of gene expression. Our data uncover a
novel role for nLASP-1.

Results
Expression of LASP-1 in normal and cancerous breast
To examine the subcellular status of the LASP-1 in vivo in normal human breast and
cancerous breast tissue, de-identified, commercial human breast tissue microarrays (TMA)
from normal, benign ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), invasive and metastatic DCIS were
evaluated. The expression of LASP-1 was undetectable in the normal human breast
epithelium, but present in myoepithelial cells (Fig. 1A). In the benign DCIS, the expression
of LASP-1 was dramatically increased in the cytosol but some tissue cores showed nuclear
LASP-1 (6.7%) (Fig.1B). In the case of metastatic DCIS with sheets of cancer cells and no
discernible mammary acini, LASP-1 was evident in the nuclei in 42.4% of the cores (Fig. 1C
& D).

Expression level of LASP-1 and cell surface CXCR4 in human breast cancer cells

Author Manuscript

When we evaluated the expression level of LASP-1 and CXCR4 in human breast cancer cell
lines, all of the tested luminal and basal-like breast cancer cell lines had robust LASP-1
expression except for BT549. β-tubulin served as the loading control (Fig. 2A). To examine
the expression of the cell surface CXCR4 we utilized FACS analysis. In order to assess the
specificity of the anti-CXCR4 antibody (12G5 clone), we employed HEK-293 parental cells,
HEK-293 cells overexpressing CXCR4 (CXCR4-NS), HEK-293 cells with stable knock
down of overexpressed CXCR4 (CXCR4-KD) (83% knock down of CXCR4 –Fig. 2B left
panel) so as to verify whether the antibody can track the changes in the level of CXCR4. In
HEK-293 parental cells, there was a small amount of CXCR4 expressed (blue trace)
compared to the isotype control (purple trace). As expected, CXCR4 overexpressing cells
(red trace) revealed a very high expression of CXCR4 which is greatly diminished upon
knock down (green trace). The change in MFI values clearly indicated the specificity of the
CXCR4 antibody (Fig. 2B right panel). Having verified the specificity of the antibody for
CXCR4, we went on to examine the level of cell surface CXCR4 in breast cancer cells using
293-CXCR4 cells as a positive control. (Fig. 2C). MCF7-parental and SKBR3 cell lines had
a low expression of cell surface CXCR4 (MFI – 131 and 265 respectively) whereas the
MDA-MB-361 cells displayed a moderate level of CXCR4 (MFI - 565). MDA-MB-231S
(MDA-MB-231 sorted for high cell surface expression of CXCR4) and MDA-Bone-Un cells
(MDA-MB-231 cells re-isolated from mouse bone metastatic lesions) had high levels of cell
surface CXCR4 (MFI – 1376 and 1942 respectively).
Chemokines and growth factors induce nuclear translocation of LASP-1

Author Manuscript

Chemokines and growth factors are abundant in the tumor microenvironment. These can
potentially drive the nuclear translocation of LASP-1 in breast cancer and stromal cells. To
test this, breast cancer cells expressing CXCR4 and/or EGFR or HER2 were stimulated with
CXCL12 or EGF or heregulin. Human microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC) stably
expressing CXCR2 (HMEC-CXCR2) were stimulated with a chemokine ligand for CXCR2,
CXCL8. Unless stated otherwise, all the breast cancer and the endothelial cells were serum
starved and pre-treated with leptomycin B (to block nuclear export) for 2 hours prior to the
LASP-1 nuclear translocation assay. Incubation of the MDA-MB-231S cells with 50 nM
CXCL12, triggered the nuclear translocation of LASP-1 at 10 min. nLASP-1 was more

pronounced after 30 min and 60 min of stimulation with CXCL12 (Fig. 3A). In contrast, in
MDA-Bone-Un cells, even in the absence of exogenous CXCL12 stimulation (50nM), there
was marked nuclear accumulation of LASP-1 (Fig. 3B). When SKBR3 cells that express
HER2 were stimulated with heregulin (Fig. 3C), there was prominent translocation of
LASP-1 to the nucleus at 30 min and extensive nuclear localization at 60 min. MDAMB-231S cells that were stimulated with EGF showed significant nLASP-1 by 30 and 60
min (Fig. S1A). In order to test whether other chemokine receptors might drive the nuclear
shuttling of LASP-1, we evaluated the effect of CXCR2 activation on LASP-1 nuclear
translocation in HMEC-CXCR2 cells. At 30 min and 60 min there was a marked
accumulation of nLASP-1 (Fig. S1B). The secondary antibody control and the IgG1 isotype
control did not contribute any fluorescent background signal (Fig. S1C). We also examined
nLASP-1 by biochemical fractionation of cytosolic and nuclear compartments followed by
Western blot analysis of LASP-1 (Fig. 3D). In MDA-MB-231S cells that were stimulated
with CXCL12, LASP-1 translocated to the nucleus in two peaks, one at 15 min followed by
a minor peak at 60 min. In MDA-Bone-Un cells, there was a strong basal accumulation of
LASP-1 in the nucleus with additional shuttling of LASP-1 upon treatment of cells with
CXCL12 at 15 and 30 min before returning to nearly basal levels at 60 min. In SKBR3 cells
stimulated with heregulin, nLASP-1 was induced at 15 min and at 60 min. There was some
basal accumulation of LASP-1 observed. When MDA-MB-231S cells were stimulated with
EGF, it was hard to observe any induction of nLASP-1 by Western blot analysis. The ligandinduced subcellular distribution profile of LASP-1 in different cell lines (25–150 cells) was
quantified and plotted (Fig. S2). These data demonstrate that LASP-1 nuclear translocation
occurs in response to several ligands, while basal levels of nLASP-1 vary among cell lines.
The reason for the decline in nLASP-1 at different time points is unclear.

Functional assessment of the role of nuclear LASP-1

Author Manuscript

In order to ascertain the functional role for nLASP-1, LASP-1 was knocked down in MCF7,
MDA-MB-231S and MDA-Bone-Un breast cancer cells using previously characterized
shRNA constructs (4). Stable polyclonal knock down clones were selected with puromycin
and the efficiency of knock down of LASP-1 was determined by Western blotting (Fig. 4A).
The effect of knock down of LASP-1 in these breast cancer cells was analyzed for effects on
1) ability to form colonies and clusters in 3D-Matrigel, 2) differences in morphological and
cytokine secretory profiles 3) changes in the gene expression profile, and 4) the ability to
adhere to collagen IV and invade through the Matrigel. The non-silenced (NS) and LASP-1
knock down (LASP-KD) breast cancer cells were cultured on Matrigel and examined for
colony growth and morphology. The MCF7-NS cells grew as tumor spheroids, both large
and small in size. The MCF7-LASP-KD spheroids were mostly medium sized. In the case of
MDA-MB-231S cells, the NS cells grew as a lawn of stellate clusters with extensive
arborization whereas the LASP-KD cells grew as isolated stellate clusters with a different
morphology (Fig. 4B). Additionally, the effect of silencing of LASP-1 on the secretory
profile of chemokines and cytokines in breast cancer cells was examined using a customdesigned antibody microarray targeting chemokines and cytokines in the tumor
microenvironment. In MCF7 cells, the level of CCL2 was reduced whereas the levels of
CXCL1, 3 and 8 were increased in the media of LASP1-KD cells. The levels of IL-6, GMCSF and CXCL3 were diminished in MDA-MB-231 parental cells when LASP-1 was

silenced. In MDA-MB-231S cells, the level of GM-CSF was reduced while the level of
CXCL8 increased (Fig. S3). Altogether these data suggest that LASP-1 is involved directly
or indirectly in cell morphology and cytokine secretion.
Loss of LASP-1 affects the expression profile of genes associated with epithelial to
mesenchymal transition (EMT) that influences the adhesive and invasive abilities of the
breast cancer cells

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

To determine whether loss of LASP-1 would result in changes in gene expression, we
examined the differential gene expression through oligo microarray analysis in NS and
LASP-KD cells (MCF7, MDA-MB-231S and MDA-Bone-Un cells). The quality of the total
RNA obtained from the breast cancer cells was analyzed by the integrity of the 28S and 18S
rRNAs (Fig. S4). The microarray data has been deposited with the accession number
GSE60324 (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc-GSE60324). We focused
here on changes in the mRNA of genes that targets cell adhesion and invasion. Genes
encoding cell junction proteins [E-cadherin, claudin, epithelial cell adhesion molecule
(EpCAM), MAL and related proteins for vesicle trafficking and membrane link domain
containing-2 (MARVELD2)] and extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins [collagen type IV,
secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC) and laminin-α4] and other genes
exhibited changes at mRNA level in MCF-7 cells (Table IA). We validated the increase in
the protein levels of E-cadherin, α4-integrin, MARVELD2 and EpCAM upon knock down
of LASP-1 in MCF7 cells (Fig. 4C). SPARC is known to down regulate E-cadherin in tumor
cells (22) while p120 catenin is known to stabilize E-cadherin (23) (24). Thus, the reduction
in SPARC and the increase in p120-catenin might explain in part the increase in E-cadherin
protein in MCF7 and MDA-MB-361 cell lines (Fig. 4D). In contrast, β-catenin levels did not
change. This increase in the level of cell junction proteins and ECM upon knock down of
LASP-1 could impair cell motility and invasion.
FAM83B, a protein involved in hyper-activation of the EGF receptor, was up-regulated 6fold in MCF7 cells with LASP-1 KD. FAM83B is involved in signaling pathways for
survival (25, 26). It is interesting to note that the transcript for the EGF ligand is also
increased 2.3-fold in LASP-1 knock down in MCF7 cells.

Author Manuscript

In MDA-MB-231S cells, two key microRNAs, miR29B1 and miR29B2, were up regulated
upon knock down of LASP-1, which correlated with reduced transcript levels for matrix
metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) (Table IB). The miRNA29B is known to down regulate MMP9
mRNA level (27). In MDA-Bone-Un cells, cell junction proteins such as claudin12 and cell
adhesion molecule2 (CADM2) were up regulated and MMP9 and MMP1 were down
regulated upon knock down of LASP-1 (Table IC). Loss of cell adhesion molecule1
(CADM1) is known to induce metastasis of breast cancer and CADM2 may play a similar
role (28). Collectively, these changes may affect the cell motility and the invasive ability of
MDA-MB231S and MDA-Bone-Un cells. The differential effects of LASP-1 silencing on
gene expression in luminal versus basal-like breast cancer cells may be due to genetic
background differences or differential expression of LASP-2. However, lack of specific
antibodies against LASP-2 hinders such investigations. We cannot rule out the possibility
that LASP-2 is present in these cells and may compensate for loss of LASP-1.

Based upon the observed changes in expression of adhesion molecules and MMPs
accompanying LASP-1 knock down, we went on to evaluate the ability of breast cancer cells
to adhere to collagen IV and invade through Matrigel. As expected, MCF7-LASP-KD cells
plated onto collagen IV matrix adhered two-fold stronger than the non-silenced control (p=
0.005) (Fig. 5A and B). Interestingly, MDA-MB-231-S non-silenced cells seeded onto the
Matrigel invaded through the Matrigel 3.5-fold more than the cells that were deficient in
LASP-1 (p<0.0001) (Fig. 5C and D). Thus LASP-1 appears to modulate the invasiveness of
breast cancer cells.
LASP-1 serves as a hub for UHRF1-DNMT1-G9a-Snail1 module

Author Manuscript

The nuclear protein/protein interactions of LASP-1was also assessed by proteomic analysis
of LASP-1 interacting proteins from a triple negative breast cancer cell line (MDA-Bone-Un
cells), where LASP-1 knock down (KD) cells were compared to non-silenced cells (NS).
This approach allowed us to distinguish proteomic hit coverages in the LASP1-KD cells
with that of the NS cells (Table II). We discovered that the association of LASP-1 with the
protein known as ‘ubiquitin-like with PHD and ring finger domains 1’ (UHRF1) which was
represented by 17 UHRF1 peptides in the for NS cell immunoprecipitate and only 5 peptides
in the KD cell immunoprecipitates (p= 0.003).

Author Manuscript

We observed that histone methyltransferase G9a, DNA methyltransferase1 (DNMT1) and
histone deacetylase1 (HDAC1) were expressed at a higher level in basal-like breast cancer
cells as compared to luminal, while UHRF1 was similar for both basal-like and luminal
breast cancer cells (Fig. S5). By employing co-immunoprecipitation and GST-pull down
approaches, we validated the association of nLASP-1 with UHRF1,DNMT1, G9a, and the
transcription factor Snail1. nLASP-1 was immunoprecipitated from MDA-Bone-Un NS and
KD cells and blotted for each of these proteins. nLASP-1 associated more with UHRF1 than
DNMT1 upon stimulation with CXCl12 (Fig. 6A). The observed basal association may be
due to the presence of LASP-1 in the nucleus (Fig. 3B, 3D and S2,) possibly due to
autocrine effects of factors produced by these tumor cells. Interestingly, MDA-Bone-Un
cells with LASP-1 knock down (KD) showed equivalent LASP-1 immunoprecipitation
compared to the NS cells. Since this cell line showed a high tendency to accumulate LASP-1
in the nucleus even with greater than 70%knock down in the total cell lysate, it appears that
there is preferential shuttling of the remaining 30% of LASP1 to the nucleus (Fig. 6E). The
LASP1 NS cells displayed a CXCL12-dependent increase in association of LASP-1 to G9
(2.2- fold) and Snail1 (4.4- fold), but just the basal association in KD cells (Fig. 6B).

Author Manuscript

We postulated that if LASP-1 serves as a hub for epigenetic proteins it may anchor itself to
the nuclear actin or bind to methylated histones on one DNA strand before the other strand
gets methylated and silenced. We tested this possibility by immunoprecipitating LASP-1 and
blotting for associated di- or tri-methylated histone H3 (di-, tri-HH3). LASP-1 associated
with di-, tri-HH3 in a CXCL12-dependent manner. There was basal association of LASP-1
with di-, tri-HH3 that increased over 15 min in response to CXCL12, followed by a decline
at 30 min (Fig. 6C).
The association of LASP-1 with epigenetic regulatory proteins was further validated by
GST-pull down studies. In order to examine the domain/s of LASP-1 that are involved in

mediating the binding of LASP-1 to G9a, UHRF1 and DNMT1, GST-fusion protein
constructs of full length LASP-1 and the LIM, LIM-NR and NR-SH3 domains of LASP-1
[that were previously characterized (4)] were employed (Fig. 6D, left panel). The GST only
control did not bind to UHRF1. UHRF1 bound to the full length LASP-1 as a doublet,
presumably the phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated forms of UHRF1. The LIM-NR
region of LASP-1 showed the stronger association with form of UHRF1 with faster mobility
in the gel (Fig. 6D, right panel). LASP-1 may preferentially bind to UHRF1 that appears to
be ubiquitinated based on the smeared staining pattern (compared to the lysate lane) and the
LIM-NR region of LASP-1 showed the strongest association with UHRF1 (Lower right
panel, Fig. 6D). Overall with deductive analysis, the LIM-NR junctional region of LASP-1
appears to mediate the binding to UHRF1, as LIM and NR-SH3 domains have a lower
affinity for UHRF1. Both G9a and DNMT1 associated preferentially with the SH3 domain
of LASP-1, though G9a bound weakly to the LIM domain of LASP-1 (Fig. 6D).

Author Manuscript

Next, we tested whether LASP-1 would directly bind to Snail1. Purified GST-Snail1 was
mixed with purified recombinant LASP-1, non-bound protein was removed by washing
thrice with binding buffer, then the LASP-1 directly binding to GST-Snail1 was assessed by
Western blotting. Results show LASP-1 indeed directly binds to GST-Snail with negligent
binding to GST alone, supporting the concept that LASP-1 can serve as a hub for epigenetic
proteins (data not shown).

Author Manuscript

We then determined whether nLASP-1 would bind to G9a and Snail1 in situ in response to
the ligand CXCL12. MDA-Bone-Un cells were serum starved and stimulated with CXCL12
for 15 min and the association of nLASP-1 with G9a was assessed by proximity ligation
assay (PLA) where co-localization is indicated by the appearance of bright red fluorescent
dots. There was a weak basal association of nLASP-1 with G9a, based upon the appearance
of red dots of dull intensity. Upon stimulation with CXCL12, the association between
nLASP-1 and G9a was stronger as indicated by the brighter dots in the PLA (Fig. 6F). Next,
we assessed if nLASP-1 would interact with Snail1 by proximity ligation assay. Upon
stimulation with CXCL12, there was increased Snail1 associating with nLASP-1based on
the presence of bright red dots (z-stack obtained at the mid nuclear level - Fig. 6G).

Discussion

Author Manuscript

LASP-1 has been previously shown to translocate to the nucleus in response to forskolin,
indicating that Gαs-coupled GPCRs can drive the nuclear translocation of LASP-1 (29). In
this paper, we show that the Gαi-coupled chemokine GPCRs, CXCR4 and CXCR2, as well
as growth factor receptors EGFR and HER-2 can trigger nuclear shuttling of LASP-1.
Increased expression of LASP-1 with increasing malignancy and enhanced nuclear
localization of LASP-1 in invasive DCIS clearly suggests a possible role for nLASP-1. Our
data show that loss of nLASP-1 resulted in reduced invasiveness, enhanced adhesion, and
altered cytokine/chemokine secretion. In advanced cases of breast cancer, nLASP-1 may
serve as a hub for UHRF1, DNMT1, G9a and the transcription factor Snail1 as it associates
with these epigenetic proteins as well as with di, tri-HH3. This has enormous significance as
chemokine and growth factor-driven nuclear localization of LASP-1 can potentially alter the
proteome through the association of LASP-1 with these key epigenetic proteins. We

observed a strong CXCL12-dependent association of nLASP-1 with UHRF1, but only a
minor increase with DNMT1. It is possible that other ligands in the tumor microenvironment
might influence the association of LASP-1 with DNMT1. Interestingly, UHRF1 confers
radio-resistance to breast cancer cells (30). G9a epigenetically activates metabolic pathways
to sustain cancer cell survival and proliferation (31, 32). The interaction of nLASP-1 with
G9a in a CXCL12-dependent manner may be significant as knock down of LASP-1 limits
proliferation by 40% (3). G9a directly interacts with DNMT1 and forms a complex in the
nucleus (33). The observed association of both G9a and DNMT1 to the SH3 domain of
LASP-1 in the GST-pulldown assay may be due to the direct protein-protein interaction
between G9a and DNMT. Up regulation of E-cadherin level when LASP-1 was silenced may
be due to two factors: 1) lower mRNA level of SPARC in MCF7 cells coupled with
increased p120 catenin; 2) loss of hub activity of nuclear LASP-1 with subsequent
destabilization of Snail1. SPARC is known to down regulate E-cadherin level and loss of it
may trigger an increase in E-cadherin level.

Author Manuscript

LASP-1 directly bound to Snail1 in a CXCL12-dependent manner. We postulate that direct

binding of nLASP-1 to Snail1 shields Snail1 from regulatory phosphorylations and
degradation that may contribute to metastasis (21, 34–39). Based on these observations, it is
possible that CXCL12 and growth factor-mediated nLASP-1 act as a hub in harnessing
Snail1 and other EMT master regulators to stabilize their protein level and activity, resulting
in regulation of chromatin accessibility and altered gene expression. So through regulation
of the stability of Snail1, the gene expression can be fine-tuned to either pro-metastatic or
anti-metastatic in nature.

Author Manuscript

In summary, the novel link described here from CXCL12-CXCR4-LASP1 to the G9a-Snail1
and UHRF1-DNMT1-G9a modules may facilitate breast tumor cell migration, local invasion
and metastasis. The reported nuclear role for LASP-1 is a novel component that may be
independent of its role in cell migration. The CXCL12-CXCR4-LASP1-Snail1 module
might form a novel therapeutic target in the triple negative as well as EGFR and HER2positive breast cancers. Thus, LASP-1 may serve as a hub for epigenetic activity in the
nucleus based on the activation of chemokine GPCRs and growth factor receptors.

Antibody microarray
The antibody microarray (RayBiotech Inc., Norcross, GA) was custom-built with several
cytokines related to breast cancer progression and metastasis. The microarray membrane
was incubated with 1 ml of serum-free media harvested from 3D-cultures MCF-7, MDAMB-231 parental and MDA-MB-231 sorted for CXCR4 (MDA-231S cells). The blot was
processed and developed as per manufacturer’s protocol.
Biochemical fractionation

Author Manuscript

Nuclear and cytosolic fractions were separated by using the ‘Nuclei EZ prep’ kit (Sigma, St.
Louis, MO). Lamin A/C and tubulin were employed to identify the purity of the fractions. In
some experiments, the CXCR4 antagonist AMD-3100 (10 μM) (Tocris, Ellisville, MO) was
employed to block CXCR4-mediated nuclear import of LASP-1 for 1 h at 37°C.
Stable knock down of LASP-1
LASP-1 was stably knocked down in human breast cancer cells using shRNA. Lentiviruses
were generated in 293-FT cells by transfecting the shRNA constructs for LASP-1
(V2LHS_64685 and V2LHS_64686; Open Biosystems, Huntsville, AL) and a non-silencing
construct (NS-control). Briefly, 3 μg of the shRNA mir plasmid, 2 μg of psPAX2 and 1 μg of
pMD2.G were transfected into 293-FT cells. Media were collected at 48 h and 72 h, pooled
and concentrated. After the viral transduction, cells were selected with puromycin and the
level of LASP-1 knock down was determined by Western blot analysis.

Stable knock down of CXCR4
CXCR4 was stably knocked down in HEK-293 cells using shRNA construct for CXCR4
(TRCN0000256864 validated clone; Sigma, St. Louis, MO). Briefly, 6 μg of the shRNA mir
plasmid was transfected into HEK-293 cells, selected with puromycin and CXCR4 knock
down was determined by Western blot analysis using anti-CXCR4 antibody (2B11 clone)
(BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA).

Tissue microarray studies

Author Manuscript

De-identified human normal breast and breast cancer tissue microarrays (Cybrdi and US
Biomax, Rockville, MD) were subjected to deparaffinization, dehydration and rehydration
followed by antigen retrieval by heating the slides at 95°C in Citrate buffer, pH 6.0 for 10
min. The cores were blocked with ‘Background Sniper’ (Biocare Medical, Concord, CA)
and LASP-1 was visualized with mouse monoclonal anti-LASP1 antibody (1:50) (Covance,
Princeton, NJ) followed by Donkey anti-mouse Cy3 secondary antibody (1:100) (Jackson
Immunoresearch, West Grove, PA) or Goat anti-mouse AlexaFluor594 (Life Technologies,
Grand Island, NY). The nuclei were stained with Hoechst (Life Technologies, Grand Island,
NY). The immunoreactivity against LASP-1 was scanned at the Digital Histology Core at
Vanderbilt University and also evaluated by confocal microscopy.
DNA Oligo microarray analysis

Author Manuscript

Total RNA was isolated from human breast cancer cells (Non-silenced and LASP-1 KD
cells) cultured on 3D-Matrigel using the RNA-STAT 60 kit (Amsbio, Lake Forest, CA). The
quality of the total RNA was tested at the Vanderbilt VANTAGE core and the RNA integrity
number (RIN value) ranged from 9.6–10 (high quality). Total RNA with high RIN values
and 28S:18S ratio was subjected to microarray analysis. The changes in gene expression
upon knock down of LASP-1were analyzed with Affymetrix human Gene 1.0 ST and 2.0 ST
arrays (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). The microarray experiments were performed in 2–4
biological replicates. The results were analyzed by PARTEK Genomics software.
Mass spectrometric identification of LASP-1 interacting proteins

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

One-dimensional and Multidimensional protein identification technology (MudPIT) was
employed to identify novel proteins that interact with LASP-1 in ‘Bone-Un’ cells.
Monoclonal anti-LASP1 antibody (MMS-426P, Covance, Princeton, NJ) was cross-linked to
Protein G magnetic beads (EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA) with
Bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate (BS3) (Sigma/Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) following the
manufacturer’s protocol. BS3 is a homo-bifunctional, non-cleavable cross-linker. The ‘BoneUn’ cells (Non-silenced and LASP1-KD) were lysed in co-immunoprecipitation buffer pH
(Co-IP buffer) 8.0 (50 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 1% IGEPAL-40, 0.5% sodium
deoxycholate, and 5 mM EDTA) with proteinase inhibitor cocktail I and phosphatase
inhibitor cocktails 2 and 3 (Sigma/Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). LASP-1 and its associated
proteins were immunoprecipitated from cell lysates (1 mg) and nutated for 2 h at 4°C. The
immune complexes were washed twice with the Co-IP buffer and once with Tris-buffered
saline, pH 7.5 to remove unbound proteins. Bound proteins were eluted and analyzed at the
proteomics core at Vanderbilt University. The results were annotated using Scaffold 4.0
software (Proteome Software, Inc., Portland, OR).
Proximity ligation assay
The proximity ligation assay (PLA) allows detection of any two interacting proteins in vivo
or in situ using antibodies raised in two different species. A pair of oligonucleotide-labeled
secondary antibodies (PLA probes) will generate a signal only when the two PLA probes are
in close proximity. The signal from each detected pair of PLA probes will be visualized as a

MO) was employed to detect the interaction between 1) LASP-1 and G9a and 2) LASP-1
and Snail. The PLA was performed according to manufacturer’s instructions. The images
were acquired by confocal microscopy.
Co-immunoprecipitation of LASP-1 with LASP-1 interacting proteins
Human breast cancer cells were serum-starved and incubated with Leptomycin B for 2 h and
stimulated with CXCL12. Pure nuclei were isolated (Nuclei EZ prep kit, Sigma, St. Louis,
MO) and the nuclear proteins were extracted with a buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 350 mM
NaCl, 1 mM DTT, protease and phosphatase inhibitors, 5 mM MgCl2 and 50 units of
DNAse I) for 1 h at 4°C. LASP-1 was immunoprecipitated from the clarified nuclear lysate
and analyzed for any associated proteins as described (4).

Cell adhesion assay
Control-silenced and LASP1-knock down MCF7 cells were trypsinized and recovered for 2
h in DMEM / 10%FBS. A 96-well plate pre-coated in triplicate with collagen IV (200
μg/mL) (Sigma/Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) and blocked with the binding buffer (DMEM with
0.1% BSA) both for 1 h at 37°C were loaded with cells (8000) and allowed to adhere to the
coated surface for 1 h at 37°C. The wells were washed and the adhered cells were fixed with
4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 1% Triton-X-100 and the nuclei were visualized
with DAPI. The fluorescent nuclei were counted from five randomly selected fields and the
experiment was repeated thrice.
Matrigel invasion assay

Author Manuscript

Matrigel invasion assay was performed (according to the manufacturer’s protocol (BD
Biosciences, San Jose, CA). The cells on the top surface were scraped off and the invaded
cells that adhered onto the bottom side of the membrane were then fixed, stained with 0.1%
crystal violet and counted from five randomly selected fields and the experiment was
repeated thrice.
Image J analysis
The band intensities of proteins were quantified by using Image J analysis 1.47v.
Statistical analysis

Author Manuscript

The data from the cell adhesion and Matrigel invasion assays were analyzed by unpaired ‘t’
test with Welch’s correction using the Prism software version 5.0 (GraphPad, La Jolla, CA).
The average and the standard error mean (S.E.M.) were calculated and the ‘p’ value is
presented in the data. For both cell adhesion and Matrigel invasion assays, five randomly
selected fields were counted and the experiment was repeated thrice (3 biological replicates).

Fig. 4. Stable silencing of LASP-1 in breast cancer cells alters cell growth and expression of
proteins favor cell-cell adhesion under 3D conditions

Author Manuscript

A) Stable knock down of LASP-1. LASP-1 was stably knocked down by employing short
hairpin microRNAs through lentiviral mediated transduction into different breast cancer
cells. The knock down efficiency was followed by Western blotting of total cell lysates for
LASP-1. β-tubulin served as the loading control.
B) MCF7 and MDA-231S cells that were stably silenced for LASP-1 expression were
cultured in Matrigel and their growth under 3D conditions was assessed. The micrographs
were obtained at 200X magnification.
C) Up regulated expression of several cell adhesion genes upon knock down of LASP-1. 20
μg of total cell lysates from non-silenced (NS) and LASP-1 knock down MCF7 cells were
separated by SDS-PAGE and blotted for E-cadherin, EpCAM, α4-integrin and MARVELD2.
β-tubulin and β-actin served as the loading controls. The band intensities of proteins were
quantified by using Image J analysis and normalized to β-actin. The fold change was given
above the bands.
D) Up regulated expression of E-cadherin and p120-catenin occurs upon knock down of
LASP-1 in luminal breast cancer cell lines: 20 μg of total cell lysates from non-silenced
(NS) and LASP-1 knock down MCF7 and MDA-MB-361 cells were separated by SDSPAGE and blotted for E-cadherin, p120-catenin and β-catenin. The % of knock down for
LASP-1 is given above the LASP-1 bands. The fold change is given above the E-cadherin,
p120-catenin and β-catenin bands. The experiment was repeated twice and the representative

C) and D) LASP-1 knock down impairs optimal invasive ability of breast cancer cells
through Matrigel.
MDA-231-S breast cancer cells (1 X 105 cells) were seeded onto the Matrigel and were
allowed to migrate to the bottom side of the partition membrane with bottom wells
containing 25 nM CXCL12 overnight. The migrated cells were fixed, stained with 0.1%
Crystal violet, and counted from 5 randomly selected fields. The data from 3 independent
experiments were plotted with standard error mean (S.E.M.) (p<0.0001).

A) LASP-1 co-immunoprecipitates with UHRF1 and DNMT1. 100 μg of the nuclear
extracts from MDA-Bone-Un cells stimulated with vehicle (0 min) or 500 ng /ml of
CXCL12 for 15 min were incubated with control mouse monoclonal IgG (Mock) or with
mouse anti-LASP-1 antibody. LASP1-bound proteins were eluted and analyzed for
endogenous LASP-1 and associated proteins UHRF1 and DNMT1. Bottom panel: 15 μg of
total cell lysates from MDA-Bone-Un cells that were stimulated with vehicle (0 min) or
CXCL12 for 15 min. LASP-1 lysate blot was obtained after stripping and re-probing for
LASP-1 after the detection of Snail1 first. The experiment was repeated twice and the
representative blot was quantified and shown. NS – Non-silenced control; KD – LASP-1
knock down. The band intensities of proteins were quantified by using Image J analysis and
normalized to their respective non-stimulated control (bands in -CXCL12 lane). The fold
change was given above the bands to track the level of the immunoprecipitated proteins with
respect to their protein levels in the lysates.
B) LASP-1 co-immunoprecipitates with G9a and Snail1. 100 μg of the nuclear extracts from
MDA-Bone-Un cells stimulated with vehicle (0 min and Mock) or 500 ng /ml of CXCL12
for 15 min were incubated with control mouse monoclonal IgG (Mock) or with mouse antiLASP-1 antibody. Bound proteins were eluted and analyzed for endogenous LASP-1 and
associated G9a and Snail1. NS – Non-silenced control; KD – LASP-1 knock down. Bottom
panel: 15 μg of total cell lysates from MDA-Bone-Un cells that were stimulated with vehicle
(0 min) or CXCL12 for 15 min. LASP-1 lysate blot was obtained after stripping and reprobing for LASP-1 after the detection of Snail1 first. The experiment was repeated twice

LASP-1 knock down. The band intensities of proteins were quantified by using Image J
analysis and normalized to their respective non-stimulated control (bands in -CXCL12 lane).
The fold-change was given above the bands to track the level of the immunoprecipitated
proteins with respect to their protein levels in the lysates.
C) LASP-1 co-immunoprecipitates with Di-, Tri-methylated histone H3. Total cell lysates
from MDA-Bone-Un cells stimulated with vehicle (0 min) or 200 ng /ml of CXCL12 for 5,
10, 15 and 30 min were incubated with control mouse monoclonal IgG (Mock) or with
mouse anti-LASP-1 antibody. The proteins were eluted and analyzed for endogenous
LASP-1 and associated di-, tri-methylated histone H3. Bottom panel: 15 μg of total cell
lysates from MDA-Bone-Un cells that were stimulated with vehicle (0 min) or CXCL12 for
5, 10, 15 and 30 min were blotted for LASP-1 and di-, tri-methylated histone H3. The
experiment was repeated thrice and the representative blot was shown.
D) LASP-1 associates with UHRF1, DNMT1 and G9a in the GST pull down assay.
Left panel: Purification of GST, full length and different domains of LASP-1fused to GST.
20 μg purified GST and GST-LASP1 (full length) and different domains of LASP-1 fused to
GST were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and stained by colloidal Coomassie blue. Lane1 –
M.W. markers; Lane 2 – GST; Lane 3 – GST-LASP1; Lane 4 – GST-LIM; Lane 5 – GSTLIM-NR; Lane 6 – GST-NR-SH3.
Right top panel: LASP-1 associates with UHRF1, DNMT1 and G9a in the GST pull down
assay. 200 μg purified GST and GST-LASP1 proteins were mixed with 1–1.5 mg of total
lysate from MDA-Bone-Un cells. Bound proteins were eluted and analyzed for association
of LASP-1 with endogenous UHRF1, DNMT1 and G9a. The experiment was repeated thrice
and the representative blot was shown. Lane 1 – 15 μg of lysate; Lane 2 – GST; Lane 3 –
GST-LASP1; Lane 4 – GST-LIM; Lane 5 – GST-LIM-NR; Lane 6 – GST-NR-SH3.
Right bottom panel: LASP-1 appears to associate with ubiquitinated UHRF1. In some GSTpull down experiments, associated UHRF1 appeared smeared but distinct; a lower and a
higher exposure of the same blot were shown. Lane 1 – 15 μg of lysate; Lane 2 – GST; Lane
3 – GST-LASP1; Lane 4 – GST-LIM; Lane 5 – GST-LIM-NR; Lane 6 – GST-NR-SH3.
E) Stable knockdown of LASP-1. MDA-Bone-Un cells employed in the coimmunoprecipitation (Co-IP) experiments were re-analyzed again to know the level of stable
knock down of LASP-1 at the time of Co-IP experiment by Western blotting of total cell
lysates (30 μg) for LASP-1. β-actin served as the loading control.
F) and G) LASP-1 associates with G9a and Snail1 in situ in a CXCL12-dependent manner.
MDA-Bone-Un breast cancer cells that were grown on glass coverslips were stimulated with
and without CXCL12 for 15 min. The cells were fixed and subjected to proximity ligation
assay. The experiment was repeated twice and the representative images are shown.
