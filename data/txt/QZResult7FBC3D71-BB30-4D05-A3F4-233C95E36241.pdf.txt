ABSTRACT
A sharp definition of what a senescent cell is still lacking since we do not have
in depth understanding of mechanisms that induce cellular senescence. In addition,
senescent cells are heterogeneous, in that not all of them express the same genes and
present the same phenotype. To further clarify the classification of senescent cells,
hints may be derived by the study of cellular metabolism, autophagy and proteasome
activity. In this scenario, we decided to study these biological features in senescence
of Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSC). These cells contain a subpopulation of stem cells
that are able to differentiate in mesodermal derivatives (adipocytes, chondrocytes,
osteocytes). In addition, they can also contribute to the homeostatic maintenance
of many organs, hence, their senescence could be very deleterious for human body
functions.
We induced MSC senescence by oxidative stress, doxorubicin treatment, X-ray
irradiation and replicative exhaustion. The first three are considered inducers of
acute senescence while extensive proliferation triggers replicative senescence also
named as chronic senescence. In all conditions, but replicative and high IR dose
senescence, we detected a reduction of the autophagic flux, while proteasome activity
was impaired in peroxide-treated and irradiated cells. Differences were observed also
in metabolic status. In general, all senescent cells evidenced metabolic inflexibility
and prefer to use glucose as energy fuel. Irradiated cells with low dose of X-ray and
replicative senescent cells show a residual capacity to use fatty acids and glutamine
as alternative fuels, respectively. Our study may be useful to discriminate among
different senescent phenotypes.

stress (i.e. perturbations to chromatin organization).
Senescence is considered a barrier against cancer since it
blocks the proliferation of transformed cells. On the other
hand, cellular senescence contributes to organismal aging.
Recently, senescence has been proposed to support other
biological processes such as development and tissue repair
[1, 2].
In depth understanding of mechanisms that
induce cellular senescence is still lacking since we do
not have a clear-cut definition of what a senescent cell
is. Several features are used to identify senescent cells,
such as enlarged and flattened morphology, senescenceassociated β-galactosidase activity, senescence-associated
heterochromatin foci, altered gene expression, telomeredysfunction-induced foci, DNA segments with chromatin
alterations reinforcing senescence (DNA-Scars),
senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP).
Nevertheless, many of these markers are not senescent cell
specific. In addition, senescent cells are heterogeneous in
that, not all senescent cells express the same genes and
present the same phenotype [1, 3]. Recently, some findings
shed a new light on what senescence is trying to reconcile,
conflicting data and definitions.
Senescence has to be considered as a dynamic
process induced by genetic and epigenetic changes. The
early senescence is the turning point, from a transient to a
stable cell-cycle arrest that is sustained by p16Ink4a and/
or p53-p21 pathways. The progression to full senescence
is associated with extensive chromatin remodeling and
production of a SASP[2]. In addition, senescent cells
should be divided in two classes: acute and chronic
senescent cells. Acute senescence is induced by extrinsic
stressors, which target a specific population of cells in
the tissue and aim to arrest the growth of damaged cells
or to be part of physiological phenomena, such as tissue
repair and embryonic development. Chronic senescence
is induced by prolonged periods of cellular stress, such
as continuous proliferation that is associated with DNA
replication and consequent accumulation of genomic
damages (replicative senescence) [2].
To further clarify the classification of senescent
cells, hints may be derived by the study of cellular
metabolism, autophagy and proteasome activity in
senescence. In this scenario, we decided to study these
aspects of senescence in Mesenchymal Stromal Cells
(MSC). These cells contain a subpopulation of stem cells
that are able to differentiate in mesodermal derivatives
(adipocytes, chondrocytes, osteocytes). In addition, they
can also contribute to the homeostatic maintenance of
many organs [4, 5]. Moreover, MSC are under scrutiny
in cellular therapy aiming at treatment of several human
diseases.
The growing attention towards stem cell metabolism
focused on metabolic needs for maintaining stemness or on
metabolic switch that are associated with fate specification
and differentiation [6-9]. Less attention has been devoted
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

to analyze the changes in metabolism that are related
to senescence of stem cells. This latter issue is of great
importance since exhaustion of stem cell compartments
contributes to decrements in tissue renewal and function.
Metabolism of senescent cells has been investigated
mainly in differentiated fibroblasts undergoing oncogenic
induced senescence. Some findings showed that senescent
cells have increased mitochondrial oxidative metabolism
with a key causative role for increased activity of the
pyruvate dehydrogenase(PDH) enzyme linking glycolysis
and tricarboxylic(TCA) cycle. Others reported a decrease
of glucose uptake and metabolism [3, 10]. In addition,
other researches evidenced that senescent fibroblasts
presented a decline in lipid biosynthesis and an increased
fatty acid oxidation. These apparently contradictory results
may be reconciled by considering that senescence is cell
type, species and context dependent phenomenon. Further
complexity arises from the consideration that different
genotoxic stressors induce phenotypically different
cellular senescent states, which have both common and
specific features, mainly at level of expressed genes
and secreted factors. Furthermore, the acquisition of a
senescent phenotype is a progressive process that, in its
initial step, may be reversible before the passage from a
transient to a stable cell-cycle arrest [1, 2].
In autophagy process, the lysosomal degradation
of cellular molecules and components is a cell response
to stress in order to maintain metabolism, and promote
cellular viability and fitness [11]. In this scenario,
senescence and autophagy represents a way to protect the
cell from external and internal stressors. Definitive studies
on the relationship between autophagy and senescence
are still lacking, since some authors suggest a direct
connection between autophagy and senescence and others
indicative of an inverse relationship. Indeed, autophagy
may promote or counteract senescence depending on
cellular context and stress stimuli [11-13]. It appears of
great interest to evaluate the role of autophagy in acute
and chronic senescence to further clarify commonality and
differences among the different types of senescence.
In addition to lysosomes, degradation of damaged
proteins (oxidized, misfolded, denatured) occur into
proteasome, which is an intracellular protease complex.
It is well known that senescence results from the
accumulation of deleterious changes over time, this may
also be due to reduced activities of proteasomes into
cells. Indeed, oxidized and cross-linked proteins tend
to accumulate in senescent cells [6, 8, 10]. It remains
to be determined, if a declining proteolytic activity of
the proteasome may play a role in the several forms of
senescence.

Senescent cells evidenced metabolic inflexibility

percentage of senescent cells increased almost two times
in all conditions but low ionizing radiations (IR) treated
cells, which showed a lower increase in senescence
(Figure 2). Following induction of senescence we
analyzed metabolism, autophagy and proteasome activity.
We named D and H, the doxorubicin- and peroxidetreated MSC. Cells treated with low (40 mGy) and high
(2000 mGy) radiations were indicated as IRL and IRH,
respectively. Replicative senescent MSC and control
cultures were named Rep and CTRL, respectively.

In order to avoid cytotoxic effect of metabolic
inhibitors (etomoxir, 2-DG and BPTES), we carried
out preliminary experiments to determine the effective
drug concentrations, which did not induce cell death,
as evaluated by trypan bleu dye exclusion test (data not
shown).
Healthy cells can oxidize several substrates for
energy production and can adapt nutrient oxidation

described in methods (D1). Chronic senescent cells were plated in growth medium (D0). After 24 hours, we performed medium change
without use of stressors (D1). The day after (D2), we replaced the growth medium with the substrate-limited medium. After 24 hours
(T0), we changed the substrate-limited medium with the assay medium. After 30 min (T30) in a group of samples, we added the metabolic
pathway inhibitor drugs (2D-glucose, etomoxir and BPTES). After 60 min (T90), we added the relative substrates (glucose, palmitate and
glutamine) in all samples. Following 60 min incubation (T150), we performed the lactate, ATP and O2 assays.

to nutrient availability (Figure 3). This last property
is called metabolic flexibility. A “metabolic flexible”
individual switches freely among the principal nutrients
(carbohydrates, lipids and amino acids) depending on
environmental cues and physiological needs [16]. This
capacity is lost in the elderly; in fact, aging is associated
with metabolic dysfunction [17, 18]. For this reason, we
aimed to evaluate to what extent metabolic inflexibility
was present in senescent cells. We grew senescent MSC
in media supplemented with a single nutrient (glucose, or
palmitate or glutamine) and evaluated ATP levels, basal
oxygen consumption, oxygen employed for mitochondrial
production and maximal respiration.
Healthy MSC appeared metabolic flexible (Figure
4A, 4B, 4C, 4D). Indeed, their ATP levels increased when
cells were incubated in medium containing only glucose,

or palmitate or glutamine compared with medium devoid
of nutrient. The ATP increase was nutrient-specific, since
it was negatively affected by the presence of metabolic
inhibitors (Figure 4A).
Senescent cells were less flexible. All senescent
MSC were able to use glucose for ATP production, but
only those treated with low dose of radiation (IRL)
evidenced a residual ability to increase ATP levels in
the presence of palmitate (Figure 4A middle graph). In
addition, only Rep cells were able to use glutamine as fuel
for ATP production (Figure 4A right graph).
The oxygen consumption assay allowed us to
determine basal oxygen consumption, the oxygen
employed for mitochondrial ATP production and maximal
respiration. In the presence of glucose, all senescent
cells were able to produce mitochondrial ATP with a

significantly impairment in production compared with
control cells (Figure 4D left graph). In media containing
palmitate only in IRL the oxygen for mitochondrial ATP
production is not significantly reduced compared with
healthy cells, while other senescent cells showed residual
ability to produce mitochondrial ATP in presence of
palmitate (Figure 4D middle graph). Only Rep cells used
glutamine as fuel for mitochondrial ATP biosynthesis in a
manner that was almost equivalent to healthy cells (Figure
4D right graph). Globally, all these data are in agreement
with those we obtained with assay measuring the total ATP
cellular levels.
Healthy cells can respond to sudden changes in ATP
demand mainly by energetic capacity of mitochondria. The
measurement of maximal respiratory capacity (oxygen
consumption in the presence of oxidative phosphorylation
uncoupler, such as FCCP) reflects how cells react to an
increased ATP demand. In media containing glucose, all
types of senescent cells, but H, showed the ability to cope
with increase in ATP requirements (Figure 4C left graph).
This capacity was not evidenced in media containing

palmitate or glutamine as energy fuels (Figure 4C middle
and right graphs).
In media containing glucose or glutamine, the basal
oxygen consumption of senescent cells was not reduced
compared to healthy cells (Figure 4B left and right
graphs). In media with palmitate, the basal respiration was
reduced in senescent cells with the exception of IRL, IRH
and Rep (Figure 4B middle graph).

Lactate
Proliferating stem cells rely mainly on the first
part of the energy production process (glycolysis) to
generate ATP rapidly in the cytoplasm and to reduce
the cytoplasmic NAD+/NADH ratio. Great part of the
resulting pyruvate is transformed in lactate by the lactate
dehydrogenase (LDH), which reconverts NADH in
NAD+. The NAD+ allows glycolysis to persist, and the
lactate is secreted from the cell [19]. As expected, healthy
MSC cultures showed the ability to produce lactate

Figure 3: Cellular energetic pathways. Glucose, fatty acids and amino acids (glutamine in the example) are the main energy fuels for
the cells. Glucose is metabolized to pyruvate through glycolysis into cytoplasm. This can be converted to lactate or enter mitochondria to
be converted in acetyl-CoA. This is combined with oxaloacetate to give citrate and undergo further oxidation in trycarboxylic acid (TCA)
cycle. Fatty acids can enter mitochondria as acyl-CoA by mean of carnitinepalmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1) and here can be oxidized to acetylCoA and fuel the TCA cycle. Glutamine can be converted to glutamate by glutaminase (GLS) and further metabolized to α-ketoglutarate
and then oxaloacetate to fuel TCA cycle. 2-deoxyglucose inhibits glycolysis; etomoxir impair acyl-CoA transfer into mitochondria; BPTES
inhibits GLS activity.

production (Table 1). This ability is almost completely lost
in all forms of senescent cells (Table 1).

occurs when autophagy is induced [20]. We determined the
level of LC3 isoforms, both in the presence and absence of
bafilomycin A1, an inhibitor of lysosomial degradation. In
D, H and IRL cells we observed a reduction of autophagic
flux, suggesting an impairment of the autophagy process
(Figure 5B). Inhibition of autophagy in these cells was
confirmed by Cyto-ID Autophagy Detection assay. The
percentage of cells expressing active autophagic vacuoles
was significantly decreased in D, H and IRL cells (Figure
5A). We detected also a reduction of cells with active
vacuole in IRH sample. This may suggest that process of
autophagy in these was not blocked (flux is comparable
to control) but the number of active vacuoles is reduced.

Autophagy was maximally impaired in some
senescent phenotypes
We measured by western blot the levels of LC3-I
and LC3-II that are two isoforms of the microtubuleassociated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3), a reliable marker
of autophagosome. We determined the autophagic flux by
tracking the conversion of LC3-I proteins to LC3-II that

Proteasome activity was reduced only in some
type of senescent cells

homeostasis and increasingly specialized functions. This is
accomplished through complete glucose oxidation within
TCA cycle [23]. Our data are in good agreement with these
premises since in healthy cultures of MSC, which contain
different cell populations, we evidenced ATP production
either through TCA cycle or anaerobic glycolysis (Figure
4). This latter event should occur mainly in the MSC stem
cell population, while mitochondrial ATP production
mainly in committed and differentiated cells. Of interest,
cells in healthy cultures had the capacity to freely switch
between alternative fuels (sugars, fats and amino acids)
as it occurs in physiological conditions (metabolic
flexibility).
All types of senescent MSC cultures did not rely on
anaerobic glycolysis since lactate production was almost
completely abolished (Table 1). This may suggest that
following induction of senescence in MSC cultures the
presence of stem cells is lost or significantly reduced.
Senescent MSC cultures appeared to produce ATP mainly
via oxidative phosphorylation. Nevertheless, they lost
the capacity to freely utilize different energy sources and
relied mainly on glucose as energy fuel. IRL and Rep
senescent cells showed a residual capacity to use fatty
acid and glutamine as alternative fuels, respectively. The
fact that different senescent inducers promote the use of
different metabolic pathways may be used to discriminate
between senescent phenotypes. In addition, it should be
underlined that the metabolic inflexibility we detected
in senescent cells is a further link with aging and related
diseases [16, 24].

We used a 20S proteasome assay to evaluate the
activity of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. This is
the main proteolytic system in cells, which catalyzes
the selective degradation proteins with abnormal
conformation and of those with short half-life (regulatory
proteins) [21]. We measured chymotrypsin-like peptidase
activity both in the presence and absence of lactacystin,
a specific and potent inhibitor of proteasomes [22].If in a
given experimental condition, the proteasome activity is
no further reduced by the presence of protease inhibitor,
this indicates a reduction of 20S proteasome functionality.
The IRL, IRH and H senescent cells showed a significant
impairment of 20S proteasome activity compared with
control (Figure 5C).

DISCUSSION
Cellular senescence is involved in several biological
processes such as tumor suppression, tumor promotion,
tissue repair, development and aging. How possible is
its involvement in apparently contrasting phenomena?
The answer resides in the consideration that, there
exist different types of senescent cells, which possess a
“common background” of shared properties and specific
features. Dissecting molecular pathways underlying
the multi-step progression of senescence and the onset
of acute versus chronic senescent cells may trigger the
discovery of new therapies for senescence-related diseases
and aging [2, 3]. In this scenario, the analysis of metabolic
needs and of the processes involved in clearance of
exhausted cellular organelles and molecules may allow for
the identification of commonalities and differences among
the various senescent phenotypes, given the relationship
of these phenomena with trigger and sustainment of
senescence.
We decided to analyze the senescence in MSC,
since to our knowledge there are only a few papers that
partially address this topic in spite of the key role of MSC
in hematopoiesis and in the homeostatic maintenance of
many organs and tissues.

Autophagy flux is impaired in some senescent
forms
In some experimental models, senescence onset
is dependent on a preliminary autophagy induction. In
contrast, in other contexts the inhibition of autophagy
promotes senescence.We evidenced that in all types of
MSC acute senescence, but IRH, the autophagy flux is
heavily impaired suggesting the autophagy counteracts
deteriorative processes, and its decline triggers
senescence. This did not occur in replicative senescence.
It remains to be determined if most of the acute stressors
that induce MSC senescence are associated with a decline
in autophagic functions. Indeed, in human fibroblasts
autophagy is activated during acute senescence induced
by oncogene activation [25].To reconcile these opposite
events, we may speculate that cells try to contend with
stress by activating autophagy that eliminates damaged
components. In this context, autophagy protects from
senescence and impairment of its function may promote
senescence. On the other hand, if autophagy cannot
counteract stress-induced damage, it may induce
senescence.

MSC senescent cells produce ATP via oxidative
phosphorylation and are metabolically inflexible
Partial utilization of glucose through anaerobic
glycolysis and shunt of its intermediates, through
the pentose phosphate pathway provides a sufficient
production of ATP, reducing cofactors and substrates to
meet anabolic requirements of stem cells for proliferation
and self-renewal. As stem cells differentiate, they change
their metabolic needs, since progenitors and differentiated
cells depend on large amounts of energy to sustain

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Proteasome activity is reduced in specific
senescent phenotypes

MSC cultures

The proteasome complex contains a threonine
protease that degrades intracellular proteins, which are
misfolded, denatured, or otherwise damaged. It can also
eliminate healthy proteins for normal cellular turn-over. It
is reasonable to hypothesize that accumulation of damaged
proteins may undermine normal cellular functions and
induce senescence. Indeed, proteasome activity is impaired
in some forms of senescence: either acute senescence in
U937 leukemic cells or chronic replicative senescence in
human fibroblasts [6, 8].
In our model, we detected a reduction of proteasome
activity in H, IRL and IRH cells. This decrease only in
specific forms of senescence may be related to the high
production of reactive oxygen species as it occurs in cells
treated with peroxide hydrogen or in irradiated cells. This
may affect proteasome functions. Indeed, mild or transient
oxidative stress up-regulates positively proteasome
activity in cells, while severe or sustained oxidative stress
impairs the function of the proteasome activity [26].

Bone marrow was obtained from three healthy
donors (age range, 6-10 years old) who had provided
informed consent. We separated cells on a Ficoll density
gradient (GE Healthcare, Italy), and the mononuclear
cell fraction was collected and washed in PBS. We
seeded 1-2.5 x 105 cells/cm2 in alpha-MEM containing
10% FBS and bFGF. After 72 hours, non-adherent cells
were discarded, and adherent cells were cultivated to
confluency. Cells were then further propagated for the
assays reported below. All cell culture reagents were
obtained from Euroclone Life Sciences (Italy).

Acute and chronic senescent MSC
For induction of acute senescence, we used three
different stressors: irradiation, doxorubicin and peroxide
hydrogen treatments. Chronic senescent MSC were
obtained by extensive in vitro cultivation for 30 days
(replicative senescence) as we already described [14].
Irradiation treatment: Exponentially growing cells
(passage 3) were irradiated with 40 and 2000 mGy X-ray
at room temperature. X-rays were administered via a
Mevatron machine (Siemens Italy) operating at 6 MeV.
Following irradiation, cells were cultivated for 48 hours
before carrying out further experiments.
Doxorubicin treatment: Cells were incubated with 1
µM doxorubicin in complete culture medium for 24 hours,
then medium was discarded and cells were incubated for
24 hours in fresh medium before further analysis.
Peroxide hydrogen treatment: Cells were incubated
with 300 µM H2O2 for 30 minutes in complete medium,
then medium was discarded and cells were incubated for
48 hours in fresh medium before further analysis.

Is it possible to create a data analysis algorithm
that could effectively identify different forms of
senescence?
The differences in metabolic needs and in the
activity of proteasome and autophagic vacuoles among
the several forms of senescent MSC we analyzed allow
identification of a specific algorithm for every phenotype
(Table 2). For example, Rep MSC can use glucose and
partially glutamine as fuels. Moreover, they did not
show change in proteasome and autophagy functions.
On the contrary, IRL, MSC use glucose and fatty acids
for their energetic needs and showed impaired activity of
proteasome and autophagy. It should be underlined that
senescence is cell type, species and context dependent
phenomenon. For this reason, the identified algorithm
holds the attention of researchers and physicians interested
in understanding the physiological role of MSC in tissue
homeostasis and regeneration and for those aiming to use
MSC in cell therapy. Our research suggests that senescent
cells in a batch of MSC that will be delivered to patients
may affect their therapeutic potential. Thus, it is essential
to evaluate the percentage of senescent cells in each batch
of MSCs that will be delivered to patients.
In conclusion, our finding may pave the way to
carry out similar investigation on other cell types and with
other stressors; this is to have a complete perspective of
senescence.

cells were plated in growth medium (D0). After 24 hours,
we performed medium change without the use of stressors
(D1).
The day after (D2), we replaced the growth medium
with the substrate-limited medium containing DMEM
(code A14430 from GIBCO LifeTech Italy), 1% FBS
0.5mM glucose, 1mM glutamax, 0.5mM carnitine.
Following 24 hour incubation (T0), we replaced the
substrate-limited medium with the assay medium (PBS
containing MgCl2 and CaCl2, 5mM HEPES, 2.5mM
glucose, 0.5mM carnitine); after 30 min (T30) in a group
of samples, we added the metabolic pathway inhibitor
drugs (48mM 2D-glucose, 0.25 mMetomoxir and 3
µM BPTES). After 60 min (T90) we added the relative
substrates(25mM glucose, 200 µM palmitate and 4mM
glutamine) in all samples. Following 60 min incubation
(T150) we performed the lactate, ATP and O2 assays.

Lactate assay

Oxygen consumption assay

Western blotting

We determined the intracellular oxygen levels in
several experimental conditions to evaluate carbohydrates,
lipids and glutamine contribution to oxygen consumption.
MitoXpress® Xtra assay (Luxcel Biosciences, Ireland)
allows measurement of extracellular Oxygen Consumption
Rates (OCR) using a oxygen-sensing fluorophore that is
quenched by O2 through molecular collision, thus, the
amount of fluorescence signal is inversely proportional to
the amount of extracellular O2 in the sample. Initially,we
measured basal respiration, later, we sequentially added
oligomycin and FCCP, which target components of the
Electron Transport Chain (ETC) in the mitochondria to
reveal key parameters of metabolic function. The two
compounds allowed for the determination of oxygen
employed for mitochondrial ATP production and maximal
respiration, respectively. We determined the OCR
according to manufacturer’s instructions.

Cells were lysed in a buffer containing 0.1%
Triton for 30 minutes at 4°C. 20 µg of each lysate was
electrophoresed in a polyacrylamide gel, and electroblotted
onto a nitrocellulose membrane. All the primary antibodies
were used according to the manufacturers’ instructions.
Immunoreactive signals were detected with a horseradish
peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (SantaCruz,
CA, USA) and reacted with ECL plus reagent (GE
Healthcare, Italy).

Lactate measurements were determined using
the lactate Assay Kit (Sigma-Aldrich Italy, Italy) by an
enzymatic assay, which results in a fluorometric (λex
= 535 nm/λem = 587 nm) product, proportional to the
lactate concentration. Measurements were performed
with the fluorometric assay in 96-well black bottom plates
following the manufacturer’s instructions.

Cyto-ID autophagy detection kit
The Cyto-ID® Autophagy Detection Kit (Enzo Life
Science, NY, USA) measures autophagic vacuoles and
monitors autophagic flux in live cells using a cationic
amphiphilic dye that selectively labels autophagic
vacuoles. We determined the percentage of Cyto-IDpositive cells according to manufacturer’s instructions.

Proteasome activity
Proteasome Activity was determined using the
20S proteasome activity assay Kit (Merck-Millipore
Italy, Italy) which is a simple method that recognizes the
substrate LLVY. The assay is based on detection of the
fluorophore 7-Amino-4- methylcoumarin (AMC) after
cleavage from the labeled substrate LLVY-AMC. The free
AMC fluorescence can be quantified using a 380/460 nm
filter set in a fluorometer. Measurements were performed
with the fluorometric assay in 96-well black bottom plates
following the manufacturer’s instructions.

ATP assay
ATP measurement was determined using the ATP
Colorimetric/Fluorometric Assay Kit (BioVision, CA,
USA), which takes advantage of glycerol phosphorylation
to generate a product that is easily quantified by
fluorometric (Ex/Em = 535/587 nm) methods.
Measurements were performed with the fluorometric
assay in 96-well black bottom plates following the
manufacturer’s instructions.

Statistical analysis
Statistical significance was evaluated using ANOVA
analysis followed by Student’s t and Bonferroni’s tests.
We used mixed-model variance analysis for data with
continuous outcomes. All data were analyzed with a
GraphPad Prism version 5.01 statistical software package
(GraphPad, CA, USA).
