Abstract
+

The abnormal trafficking of CD34 cells is a unique characteristic of primary myelofibrosis (PMF). We have further studied
the behavior of PMF CD34+ cells by examining their homing to
the marrow and the spleens of nonobese diabetic/severe
combined immunodeficient (NOD/SCID) mice. Following the
infusion of PMF and normal granulocyte colony-stimulating
factor–mobilized peripheral blood (mPB) CD34+ cells into
NOD/SCID mice, reduced numbers of PMF CD34+ cells and
granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming unit (CFU-GM) compared with mPB were detected in the marrow of these mice,
whereas similar numbers of PMF and mPB CD34+ cells and
CFU-GM homed to their spleens. The abnormal homing of
PMF CD34+ cells was associated with reduced expression of
CXCR4, but was not related to the presence of JAK2V617F.
The sequential treatment of PMF CD34+ cells with the
chromatin-modifying agents 5-aza-2¶-deoxycytidine (5azaD)
and trichostatin A (TSA), but not treatment with small
molecule inhibitors of JAK2, resulted in the generation of
increased numbers of CD34+CXCR4+ cells, which was accompanied by enhanced homing of PMF CD34+ cells to the marrow
but not the spleens of NOD/SCID mice. Following 5azaD/TSA
treatment, JAK2V617F-negative PMF hematopoietic progenitor
cells preferentially homed to the marrow but not the spleens
of recipient mice. Our data suggest that PMF CD34+ cells are
characterized by a reduced ability to home to the marrow
but not the spleens of NOD/SCID mice and that this
homing defect can be corrected by sequential treatment with
chromatin-modifying agents. [Cancer Res 2009;69(19):7612–8]

Introduction
In normal individuals, only a small fraction of hematopoietic
stem cells (HSC) and hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPC)
regularly exit the bone marrow (BM) and circulate in the
peripheral blood (PB; ref. 1). The fine balance between
mobilization, homing, and retention of HSCs/HPCs within the
marrow microenvironment is a characteristic of normal adult
hematopoiesis. Stem cell trafficking is largely dependent on the
interaction between a number of integrins and chemokine
receptors expressed by HSCs/HPCs and a variety of matrix

proteins present within the marrow microenvironment and
chemokines elaborated by marrow fibroblasts, osteoblasts, or
endothelial cells (2). The administration of hematopoietic growth
factors (granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, G-CSF) leads to
transient increments in the number of circulating HSCs/HPCs (3).
The interactions between CXC chemokine stromal-derived factor-1
(SDF-1) and its receptor CXCR4 play a pivotal role in determining
the migration, homing, retention, proliferation, and differentiation
of human HSCs/HPCs (2–4).
By contrast, the myeloproliferative neoplasm, primary myelofibrosis (PMF), is characterized by abnormal CD34+ cell trafficking,
resulting in constitutive mobilization of CD34+ cells (5–8). We have
reported that PMF PB CD34+ cells contain not only HPCs but also
BM-repopulating cells belonging to the malignant clone (8).
Whether this constitutive mobilization is a direct result of qualitative abnormalities of HSCs/HPCs, or a change in the interaction
between PMF HSCs/HPCs and the BM stem cell niche, has been the
subject of considerable investigation (9–14).
Homing is thought to be a coordinated, multistep process, which
involves SDF-1/CXCR4 interactions, activation of lymphocyte
function–associated antigen-1 (LFA-1), a4h1 integrin (VLA-4),
and a5h1 integrin (VLA-5), and rearrangement of the cytoskeleton
of HSCs/HPCs (15, 16). The homing of PMF CD34+ cells and the
role of the SDF-1/CXCR4 axis and VLA-4 in this process have not
been previously explored. Since reduced expression of CXCR4 by
PMF CD34+ cells has been previously documented (12, 14), we
hypothesized that PMF CD34+ cells might exhibit a compromised
ability to home to the marrow.
A gain of function mutation in the JH2 domain of the Janus
kinase 2 (JAK2V617F) has been identified in the Philadelphianegative myeloproliferative neoplasms; the JAK2V617F mutation is
present in f50% of patients with PMF (17, 18). In f10% of
JAK2V617F-negative PMF, another somatic mutation at codon 515
of the transmembrane-juxtamembrane junction of the thrombopoietin receptor gene, MPL, has also been identified (19). The
presence of these two mutations is associated with constitutive
activation of JAK/STAT proteins, which results in HPC hypersensitivity to growth factors (17–19). The JAK/STAT pathway has also
been reported to be involved in the activation of genes responsible
for cancer cell growth, survival, invasion, and migration (20, 21),
suggesting that abnormal PMF CD34+ cell trafficking might be a
consequence of JAK2V617F.
The malignant phenotype in PMF likely results from a
combination of genetic abnormalities and epigenetic modifications leading to the dysregulation of critical genes that contribute
to cell proliferation, differentiation, and cell death (17–19, 22–24).
Methylation of cytosine residues in the promoter region as well as
transcriptional inhibitory complexes including histone deacetylases (HDAC) play a role in the transcriptional silencing of genes
in a variety of human cancers (25–27). For instance, the reduced

mice was studied and its correction by treatment with chromatinmodifying agents was assessed.

expression of CXCR4 by PMF CD34+ cells has been attributed to
hypermethylation of its promoter (14). Several reports have
indicated that re-expression of silenced genes can be achieved by
sequential treatment with a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor
followed by an HDAC inhibitor (28, 29). We have previously
reported that the sequential treatment of PMF CD34+ cells with
5-aza-2’-deoxycytidine (5azaD), followed by trichostatin A (TSA),
resulted in up-regulation of CXCR4 expression by PMF CD34+
cells and restoration of their migratory response to SDF-1 (30).
In this article, we further tested the hypothesis that downregulation of CXCR4 expression plays an important role in the
abnormal trafficking of PMF CD34+ cells. The homing of PMF
CD34+ cells to the marrow and spleens of sublethally irradiated

Patient specimens and CD34+ cell isolation. G-CSF–mobilized PB
(mPB) CD34+ cells from 10 donors were purchased from StemCell
Technologies. PB was collected from 33 patients who fulfilled the WHO
diagnostic criteria for PMF (31). All patients had signed an informed
consent approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Mount Sinai
School of Medicine.
Granulocytes were isolated by previously described techniques (10, 17, 18).
CD34+ cells were selected from PB low-density mononuclear cells using a
CD34+ cell selection kit (StemCell Technologies) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The purity of the CD34+ cell population was analyzed
using a FACSCanto flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson). CD34+ cell
populations with a purity of z90% was used in all experiments.
JAK2V617F and MplW515L mutational analysis. JAK2V617F and
MplW515L were detected by analyzing the PB granulocytes of patients with
PMF as described previously (32, 33). Among the 33 PMF patients used in
this study, 19 patients were JAK2V617F positive, whereas none were
MplW515L positive.
Treatment of PMF CD34+ cells with 5azaD and TSA. PMF CD34+ cells
(1  105/mL) were cultured in Iscove’s modified Dulbecco’s medium
(IMDM; Bio Whittaker) containing 30% fetal bovine serum (FBS; HyClone
Laboratories) supplemented with 100 ng/mL stem cell factor, 100 ng/mL
FLT-3 ligand, 100 ng/mL thrombopoietin, and 50 ng/mL interleukin-3 (IL-3;
Amgen) and incubated in a humidified incubator maintained at 37jC with
5% CO2. After an initial 16 h of incubation, cells were exposed to 5azaD
(Pharmachemie B.V.) at a concentration of 1 Amol/L. After 48 h, cells were
washed and then distributed to new culture plates containing stem cell
factor, FLT-3 ligand, and thrombopoietin with TSA (Sigma), which was
added once at the beginning of the following 7-day culture at a
concentration of 16.5 nmol/L. In addition, parallel cultures to which
5azaD/TSA were not added were performed. The CD34+ cells were
reisolated as described above after 9 d of culture.
Treatment of PMF CD34+ cells with small molecule inhibitors of
JAK2. PMF CD34+ cells (1  105/mL) were cultured in IMDM containing
FBS and cytokines as described above. After an initial 16 h of incubation,
cells were cultured in the presence or absence of JAK inhibitor
1 (Calbiochem) or AZ1480 (gift of AstraZeneca) at a concentration of
100 nmol/L. After 72 h, the cells were washed and analyzed for CD34
and CXCR4 expression.
Flow cytometric analysis of CD34+ cells. Primary PMF CD34+ cells,
mPB, and PMF CD34+ cells after 3 or 9 d of culture were stained with
anti-human CD34 monoclonal antibody (mAb) conjugated to allophycocyanin and CXCR4 (clone# 12G5) or VLA-4 conjugated to phycoerythrin.
All mAb were purchased from Becton Dickinson Pharmingen. Each
analysis was paired with a corresponding matched isotype control.
Immediately before flow cytometric analysis, 1 Ag/mL propidium iodide
(Sigma) was added to exclude nonviable cells. Cells were analyzed flow
cytometrically and at least 10,000 viable cells were acquired from each
sample (Cell-Quest software, Becton Dickinson). To avoid underestimating CXCR4 expression, initially, we stained primary PMF CD34+ cells
and mPB CD34+ cells using anti-human CXCR4 mAb purchased from
R&D Systems. The mAb, 44717, which recognizes the second external
loop of the CXCR4 receptor (34), has been reported to be capable of
recognizing a greater degree of CXCR4 expressed by primary and
transformed T cells as well as primary B cells (35). By contrast 12G5,
the mAb most commonly used to study CXCR4 expression recognizes
extracellular loops 1 and 2 of the receptor (34) but identifies a smaller
fraction of primary cells expressing CXCR4 (35).
Homing assay. NOD/LtSz-Prkdcscid (NOD/SCID) mice were purchased
from the Jackson Laboratory. All experiments were approved by the Animal
Care Committee of the Mount Sinai School of Medicine. The mPB CD34+
cells, primary PMF CD34+ cells, or PMF CD34+ cells reisolated after ex vivo
culture (0.5 or 1  106/mouse) were transplanted via the tail vein into 8- to

9-wk-old sublethally irradiated (320 cGy) NOD/SCID mice. Twenty-four
hours after transplantation, mice were sacrificed and cells were recovered
from the BM of two femurs, one tibia, and the spleens of the recipient mice.
The presence of human CD34+ cells in BM and spleen cells was determined
by mAb staining and flow cytometric analysis of 106 cells per sample. Cells
obtained from mice not receiving transplants were stained with isotope
control antibodies to exclude false positivity.
To assay for human HPCs, murine marrow and spleen cells from
mice transplanted with human cells were cultured in semisolid medium
as previously described (36). Mononuclear cells (5 or 10  104/mL) were
suspended in methylcellulose [Methocult (H4230); Stem Cell Technologies] with 20% IMDM supplemented with 50 ng/mL human granulocyte
macrophage colony-stimulating factor, 50 ng/mL human stem cell
factor, and 50 ng/mL human IL-3, conditions previously reported to
promote human colony formation. Using these conditions, no colony
growth was observed when BM from saline-injected animals was
assayed (36). We confirmed the human origin of these individual
colonies by plucking and analyzing cells for the human 17-a satellite
gene and the murine GAPDH gene by reverse transcription-PCR. The
total number of human colony forming unit-granulocyte and macrophage (CFU-GM) present in the BM of a mouse was calculated based on
the assumption that one tibia and two femurs represented 12% of the
total BM (37). The human CFU-GM that homed to the BM and spleens
of mice transplanted with JAK2V617F-positive PMF CD34+ cells were
further analyzed for JAK2V617F using nested allele-specific PCR as we
previously described (38).
Statistical analysis. The results are reported as the mean F SD of data
obtained from four to six individual experiments. Statistical significance
was determined using Student’s t tests or paired samples t test. All P values
were two-sided.

Results
Reduced homing of PMF CD34+ cells to the marrow of NOD/
SCID mice. The homing of PMF and mPB CD34+ cells to the marrow
and spleens of sublethally irradiated NOD/SCID mice was evaluated.

Figure 1A shows the presence of human CD34+ cells in the marrow
and spleens of recipient mice. As shown in Fig. 1B, following the
infusion of either PMF (n = 14) or mPB (n = 6) CD34+ cells, reduced
numbers of marrow PMF CD34+ cells and human CFU-GM
were detected [130 F 35 PMF CD34+ cells/106 BM cells (BMC)
versus 295 F 28 mPB CD34+ cells/106 BMCs, P < 0.01; 0.62 F 0.19%
of input PMF CFU-GM versus 6.95 F 2.13% of input mPB CFU-GM,
P < 0.001]. By contrast, similar numbers of PMF and mPB CD34+
cells and human CFU-GM were detected in the spleens of these
animals (463 F 66 PMF CD34+ cells/106 spleen cells versus 526 F
42 mPB CD34+ cells/106 spleen cells, P = 0.58; 0.41 F 0.12% of
input PMF CFU-GM versus 0.34 F 0.20% of input mPB CFU-GM,
P = 0.76; Fig. 1C).
The defective homing of PMF CD34+ cells to the marrow is
independent of JAK2V617F. As shown in Fig. 2A and B, the
numbers of human CD34+ cells and CFU-GM were equally reduced in
the marrow of mice infused with either JAK2V617F-positive (107 F
46 PMF CD34 + cells/10 6 BMCs, P < 0.01; 0.83 F 0.34% of input
PMF CFU-GM, P < 0.01) or JAK2V617F-negative PMF CD34 + cells
(139 F 41 PMF CD34 + cells/106 BMCs, P < 0.05; 0.36 F 0.07% of
input PMF CFU-GM, P < 0.01) compared with mPB CD34 + cells
(295 F 28 mPB CD34 + cells/10 6BMCs and 6.95 F 2.13% of input
mPB CFU-GM). Similar numbers of CD34+ cells and human
CFU-GM were detected in the spleens of mice infused with
JAK2V617F-positive (434 F 37 PMF CD34+ cells/106 spleen cells;
0.30 F 0.17% of input PMF CFU-GM) or JAK2V617F-negative
PMF CD34 + cells (484 F 79 PMF CD34 + cells/10 6spleen cells;
0.52 F 0.18% of input PMF CFU-GM; Fig. 2C and D ). These
findings suggest that the impaired PMF CD34 + cell homing to the
marrow is not solely a consequence of JAK2V617F.
Reduced expression of CXCR4 by PMF CD34+ cells. Several
groups have suggested that the constitutive mobilization of PMF
CD34+ cells might be related to the down-regulation of CXCR4

(n = 8) were reduced compared with the
behavior of mPB CD34+ cells (n = 6).
There was no difference in the behavior of
mice infused with JAK2V617F-positive or
JAK2V617F-negative PMF CD34+ cells
(P > 0.05). Similar numbers of CD34+ cells
(C ) and human CFU-GM (D ) were
detected in the spleens of mice infused
with JAK2V617F-positive and
JAK2V617F-negative PMF CD34+ cells
compared with mPB CD34+ cells.

expression (12, 14). We therefore examined CXCR4 expression by
PMF CD34+ cells. As shown in Fig. 3A, the percentage of PMF
CD34+ cells that expressed CXCR4 was significantly lower (4.8 F
2%; P < 0.05) than mPB CD34+ cells (15.3 F 4.3%). The reduced
expression of CXCR4 by PMF CD34+ cells, as indicated by the
percentage of positive cells and the mean fluorescence intensity,
was similar using mAb 12G5 or 44717 (Supplementary Fig. S1).

Figure 4. Effects of 5azaD/TSA treatment on PMF CD34+ cells. The percentage
of CD34+ cells coexpressing CXCR4 was significantly increased in the cultures
containing cytokines plus 5azaD/TSA compared with CD34+ cells in cultures
containing cytokines alone or primary PMF CD34+ cells (A). The absolute
number of CD34+ cells expressing CXCR4 was significantly increased in the
cultures containing cytokines plus 5azaD/TSA (B). *, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01.

Figure 3. CXCR4 expression by primary PMF CD34+ cells or PMF CD34+ cells
treated with JAK2 inhibitors. A, significantly reduced expression of CXCR4 by
PMF CD34+ cells was observed. A similar degree of reduced expression of
CXCR4 was detected in both JAK2V617F-positive and JAK2V617F-negative
PMF CD34+ cells compared with mPB CD34+ cells. *, P < 0.05. B and C,
PMF CD34+ cells (1  105/mL; n = 7) were cultured in the presence of cytokines
alone or cytokines plus JAK inhibitor 1 or AZ1480 for 3 d and analyzed
for the expression of CXCR4 flow cytometrically. A greater percentage (B) and
number (C ) of CD34+ cells expressing CXCR4 was detected following the
culture of JAK2V617F-positive PMF CD34+ cells with cytokines alone. However,
the percentage (B) and the number (C ) of JAK2V617F-positive PMF CD34+
cells that expressed CXCR4 was not further enhanced by treatment with JAK
inhibitors *, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01 versus primary PMF CD34+ cells.

Vascular cell adhesion molecule-1/VLA-4 interactions also plays
a role in HSC trafficking (39, 40). We therefore determined if
differences in the expression of VLA-4 by PB CD34+ cells might
also contribute to the abnormal trafficking of PMF CD34+ cells.
The percentage of mPB and PMF CD34+ cells that expressed
VLA-4 was however, similar (data not shown).
JAK2V617F was not associated with reduced expression of
CXCR4 by PMF CD34+ cells. As shown in Fig. 3A, JAK2V617Fpositive and JAK2V617F-negative PMF CD34+ cells exhibited a
similar degree of reduced CXCR4 expression. We further examined
if CXCR4 expression by JAK2V617F-positive PMF CD34+ cells could
be altered by treatment with two JAK2 inhibitors, JAK inhibitor 1 or
AZ1480. Treatment of PMF CD34+ cells with cytokines and either
JAK inhibitors resulted in a 25% or 22% reduction, respectively, in
the absolute number of CD34+ cells compared with cells exposed to
cytokines alone. As shown in Fig. 3B and C, a greater number of
CD34+ cells expressing CXCR4 were detected following the culture
of JAK2V617F-positive PMF CD34+ cells with cytokines alone,
which was not, however, further enhanced by treatment with either
of the JAK2 inhibitors.
5azaD/TSA treatment increased the numbers of PMF
CD34+CXCR4+ cells. PMF CD34+ cells (1  105) generated greater
numbers of cells when cultured in the presence of cytokines alone
(19.94 F 4.06  105) than in the presence of cytokines plus 5azaD/
TSA (12.97 F 1.66  105). The proportion of CD34+ cells in cultures
containing 5azaD/TSA (12.09 F 3.34%) was, however, greater than
in cultures containing cytokines alone (7.15 F 1.65%; P < 0.05). The
absolute number of PMF CD34+ cells in cultures exposed to
cytokines alone (1.70 F 0.56 times) or cytokines plus 5azaD/TSA
(1.48 F 0.39 times) were both greater than that present in the input

population. The percentage of CD34+ cells that was CXCR4 positive
within the 5azaD/TSA-treated PMF CD34+ cell cultures, however,
was significantly greater (27.86 F 5.88%) than in cells exposed to
cytokines alone (8.05 F 1.43%; P < 0.01) or primary PMF CD34+
cells (1.81 F 0.52%; P < 0.01; Fig. 4A). In addition, treatment of PMF
CD34+ cells in vitro with cytokines plus 5azaD/TSA led to a 3- to 4fold increase in the absolute numbers of CD34+CXCR4+ cells
compared with CD34+ cells exposed to cytokines alone (P < 0.05)
and a 24- to 72-fold increase of the number of CD34+CXCR4+ cells
when compared with input PMF CD34+ cells (P < 0.05; Fig. 4B).
Correction of the abnormal homing of PMF CD34+ cells by
treatment with 5azaD/TSA. We next determined if the upregulation of CXCR4 by PMF CD34+ cells following the treatment
with chromatin-modifying agents was associated with correction
of the impaired homing of primary PMF CD34+ cells. After
culture, CD34+ cells were reisolated and transplanted into NOD/
SCID mice. As can be seen in Fig. 5A, treatment of PMF CD34+
cells with cytokines alone resulted in 3- to 6-fold greater number
of CD34+ cells homing to NOD/SCID marrow than that observed
with primary PMF CD34+ cells (P < 0.01). By contrast, 10- to 14fold greater numbers of CD34+ cells treated with 5azaD/TSA
homed to mouse marrow than primary PMF CD34+ cells (P <
0.001), whereas 2.5- to 3-fold greater numbers of 5azaD/TSA
treated CD34+ cells homed to mouse marrow than PMF CD34+
cells treated with cytokines alone (P < 0.001). The proportion of
assayable human CFU-GM that homed to the marrow of mice
transplanted with PMF CD34+ cells from cultures treated with
cytokines plus 5azaD/TSA was significantly greater (8.71 F
2.28%) than the proportion of transplanted human CFU-GM from
cultures of PMF CD34+ cells exposed to cytokines alone (1.34 F
0.45%; P < 0.05) or primary PMF CD34+ cells (0.52 F 0.24%; P <
0.05; Fig. 5B). The proportion of transplanted human CFU-GM
from each type of graft that homed to the spleens of NOD/SCID
mice was similar (Fig. 5C and D).
5azaD/TSA treatment reduces the percentage of JAK2V617Fpositive CFU-GM that home to the marrow. A total of 6 of the

12 patients were JAK2V617F positive. In five of six patients, the
JAK2V617F allelic burden ranged from 40% to 86%. We then analyzed
the JAK2V617F allelic status of CFU-GM assayed from the BM and
spleens of mice transplanted with human cells. As shown in Fig. 6A,
the percentage of JAK2V617F-negative CFU-GM that homed to the
BM of mice transplanted with CD34+ cells from cultures treated with
cytokines plus 5azaD/TSA was significantly greater (68.91 F 16.83%)
than CD34+ cells exposed to cytokines alone (17.19 F 8.23%; P < 0.05)
or primary PMF CD34+ cells (23.39 F 9.29%; P < 0.05). By contrast,
the percentage of JAK2V617F-negative CFU-GM in the spleens of
mice transplanted with 5azaD/TSA-treated PMF CD34+ cells was
similar (23.49 F 10.02%) to that transplanted with either PMF CD34+
cells exposed to cytokines alone (12.84 F 6.67%) or primary PMF
CD34+ cells (15.89 F 8.30%; Fig. 6B). These findings suggest that the
homing of PMF CD34+ cells to the marrow but not the spleen can be
corrected by treatment with 5azaD/TSA. JAK2V617F-negative
myeloproliferative neoplasm HPCs that persist following 5azaD/
TSA treatment seem to preferentially home to the marrow but not
the spleens of recipient mice.

Discussion
Abnormal CD34+ cell trafficking is an integral part of the
pathobiology of PMF (5). We have shown that the homing of PMF
CD34+ cells to the marrow but not the spleens of NOD/SCID mice
is defective and is associated with down-regulation of CXCR4.
Other groups have also showed that SDF-1/CXCR4 interactions
play a crucial role in the homing of both normal HSCs/HPCS (41)
and human leukemic HSCs to the BM of NOD/SCID mice (42). By
contrast, the expression of the integrin VLA-4 that is also involved
in stem cell trafficking does not seem to be aberrantly expressed by
PMF CD34+cells and therefore is not responsible for the abnormal
cell trafficking in PMF.
Because PMF CD34+ cells still retain the ability to home to the
spleen, this might play a role in their localization to extramedullary
sites and the establishment of hematopoiesis. Such studies suggest

marrow but not the spleens of NOD/SCID
mice. After 9-d culture of primary PMF
CD34+ cells in the presence of cytokines
alone or cytokines plus 5azaD/TSA
(n = 12), 0.5 or 1  106 reisolated CD34+
cells or primary PMF CD34+ cells
were transplanted into NOD/SCID mice.
Following the treatment of PMF CD34+ cells
with 5azaD/TSA, greater numbers of
CD34+ cells (A) and a greater proportion
of human CFU-GM (B) homed to the
marrow than that observed with primary
PMF CD34+ cells or PMF CD34+ cells
treated with cytokines alone. **, P < 0.01;
***, P < 0.001; *, P < 0.05. The treatment of
PMF CD34+ cells with 5azaD/TSA did not,
however, increase the number of CD34+
cells (C) or proportion of human
CFU-GM (D ) that homed to the spleens.

Abnormal Trafficking of PMF CD34+ Cells

Figure 6. 5azaD/TSA treatment reduces the percentage of JAK2V617F-positive
CFU-GM that homed to mouse marrow. The human CFU-GM that homed to
the BM and spleens of mice transplanted with JAK2V617F-positive primary PMF
CD34+ cells or PMF CD34+ cells reisolated after ex vivo culture (n = 5) were
further analyzed for JAK2V617F using nested allele-specific PCR. The
percentage of JAK2V617F-negative CFU-GM that homed to the BM transplanted
with CD34+ cells from cultures treated with cytokines plus 5azaD/TSA was
significantly greater than that observed with transplantation of CD34+ cells from
cultures exposed to cytokines alone or primary PMF CD34+ cells (A ). *, P < 0.05.
By contrast, the percentage of JAK2V617F-negative CFU-GM in 5azaD/TSAtreated PMF CD34+ cells that homed to the spleens was similar to that of
PMF CD34+ cells exposed to cytokines alone or primary PMF CD34+ cells (B ).

that the microenvironment within the marrow and spleen differs.
Such distinct characteristics of the hematopoietic microenvironment at various locales may be important in disease progression in
PMF. It has also been reported that elevated numbers of
endothelial progenitor cells and mesenchymal stem cells, which
exist within the CD34+ cell subpopulation in PMF, are present in
the blood and spleens of patients with PMF (43, 44). Therefore, the
mobilization of CD34+ cells from the BM and homing to the spleen
might contribute to the creation of both vascular and stromal
microenvironments that facilitate the development of the MPD
clones at these sites.
Several studies have indicated that JAKs are key signaling elements affecting chemokine receptor signaling (45, 46). However, other
investigators have not confirmed such relationships (47). Our data
suggest that the impaired homing of PMF CD34+ cells is not related
to the presence of the JAK2V617F because the expression of CXCR4

by PMF CD34+ cells was independent of the presence of the mutation
and was not affected by treatment with JAK2 inhibitors. Recently,
Bogani and colleagues (14) have reported similar results.
In the present study, we showed that the treatment of PMF
CD34+ cell with 5azaD/TSA resulted in up-regulation of CXCR4
and correction of the impaired homing of PMF CD34+ cell to the
marrow of NOD/SCID mice. Treatment of PMF CD34+ cells with
5azaD/TSA resulted in not only an increase of the number of
CD34+ cells expressing CXCR4 but also an increased density of
CXCR4 (data not shown). The up-regulation of CXCR4 by
chromatin-modifying agents has been previously shown to be
due to the reversal of abnormal methylation of the CXCR4
promoter and the subsequent enhanced transcription of CXCR4
mRNA (14). Moreover, the treatment of PMF CD34+ cell with
5azaD/TSA promoted JAK2V617F-negative CD34+ cells that
persisted following 5azaD/TSA treatment to home to the marrow
but not the spleens of NOD/SCID mice. The sequential
treatment of PMF CD34+ cells with 5azaD/TSA has been
reported to result in a reduction of the number of JAK2V617Fpositive progenitor cells (30), whereas the treatment of normal
BM and cord blood stem cells in vitro with these same agents
leads to their symmetrical cell division and stem cell expansion
(48). The correction of PMF CD34+ cell trafficking following the
treatment of chromatin-modifying agents could, therefore, be
due either to the increased expression of CXCR4 by malignant
and normal CD34+ cells or an increased number of normal HSC/
HPC relative to the number of malignant HSC/HPC. It also
remains possible that the expression of other as yet unidentified
integrins or chemokine receptors involved in stem cell trafficking
might be also responsible for correction of HSCs/HPCs homing
by chromatin-modifying agents.
In conclusion, our data indicate that PMF CD34+ cells are
characterized by defective homing to the marrow but not the
spleen and that this homing defect can be corrected by sequential
treatment with chromatin-modifying agents. Chromatin-modifying
agents represent a possible means of correcting the abnormal
cellular trafficking characteristic of PMF, a therapeutic strategy that
is currently being evaluated in the clinic. Furthermore, the use of
such agents in combination with small molecule inhibitors of JAK2
in future therapeutic trials might represent an opportunity to
target several abnormalities of PMF CD34+ cell behavior.
