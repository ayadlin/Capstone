Abstract
Author Manuscript

Tumour-specific mutations are ideal targets for cancer immunotherapy as they lack expression in
healthy tissues and can potentially be recognized as neo-antigens by the mature T-cell repertoire.
Their systematic targeting by vaccine approaches, however, has been hampered by the fact that
every patient’s tumour possesses a unique set of mutations (‘the mutanome’) that must first be
identified. Recently, we proposed a personalized immunotherapy approach to target the full
spectrum of a patient’s individual tumour-specific mutations1. Here we show in three independent
murine tumour models that a considerable fraction of non-synonymous cancer mutations is
immunogenic and that, unexpectedly, the majority of the immunogenic mutanome is recognized
by CD4+ T cells. Vaccination with such CD4+ immunogenic mutations confers strong antitumour
activity. Encouraged by these findings, we established a process by which mutations identified by
exome sequencing could be selected as vaccine targets solely through bioinformatic prioritization

on the basis of their expression levels and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class IIbinding capacity for rapid production as synthetic poly-neo-epitope messenger RNA vaccines. We
show that vaccination with such polytope mRNA vaccines induces potent tumour control and
complete rejection of established aggressively growing tumours in mice. Moreover, we
demonstrate that CD4+ T cell neo-epitope vaccination reshapes the tumour microenvironment and
induces cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses against an independent immunodominant antigen in
mice, indicating orchestration of antigen spread. Finally, we demonstrate an abundance of
mutations predicted to bind to MHC class II in human cancers as well by employing the same
predictive algorithm on corresponding human cancer types. Thus, the tailored immunotherapy
approach introduced here may be regarded as a universally applicable blueprint for comprehensive
exploitation of the substantial neo-epitope target repertoire of cancers, enabling the effective
targeting of every patient’s tumour with vaccines produced ‘just in time’.

We recently reported comprehensive mapping of non-synonymous mutations of the B16F10
tumour by next-generation sequencing (Fig. 1a)1. Tumour-bearing C57BL/6 mice were
immunized with synthetic 27mer peptides encoding the mutated epitope (mutation in
position 14), resulting in T-cell responses which conferred in vivo tumour control. In
continuation of that work, we now characterized the T-cell responses against the neoepitopes, starting with those with a high likelihood of MHC I binding. Mice were vaccinated
with synthetic 27mer peptides (Fig. 1b). Immunogenic mutations were identified by IFN-γ
ELISpot of splenocytes and T-cell subtype was determined by cytokine release assay (Fig.
1a). About 30% of neo-epitopes were found to induce mutation-reactive cytokine-secreting
T cells. Surprisingly, responses against nearly all mutated epitopes (16/17, 95%) were CD4+
(Fig. 1b, Extended Data Table 1).

Author Manuscript

To exclude bias associated with the peptide format, this experiment was repeated using in
vitro transcribed (IVT) mRNA encoding the neo-epitopes. Also in this setting the majority
of mutation-specific immune responses (10/12, ~80%) were conferred by CD4+ T cells
(Extended Data Fig. 1, Extended Data Table 1).

Author Manuscript

Recently, we identified over 1,680 non-synonymous mutations2 in the colon carcinoma
model CT26 in BALB/c mice. We selected 48 of these mutations in analogy to the B16F10
study based on good MHC class I binding (‘low score’ 0.1–2.1). The other half was
deliberately chosen for poor binding (‘high score’ >3.9). In total, about 20% of mutated
epitopes were found to be immunogenic in mice immunized with the respective RNA
monotopes (Fig. 1c, Extended Data Table 2). In the ‘low’ MHC I score subgroup, but not in
the ‘high’ score subgroup, several epitopes inducing CD8+ T cells were identified (Fig. 1c
right). MHC class II-restricted epitopes were represented in similar frequency in both
subgroups, constituting the majority of CT26 immunogenic mutations (16/21, 80%).
Similarly, in the 4T1 mammary carcinoma model about 70% of the immunogenic epitopes
determined by RNA monotope vaccines representing all 38 mutations of this model were
recognized by CD4+ T cells (Fig. 1d, Extended Data Table 3). In summary, we showed that
in three independent mouse tumour models with different MHC backgrounds, a considerable
fraction of non-synonymous cancer mutations is immunogenic and quite unexpectedly, the
immunogenic mutanome is predominantly recognized by CD4+ T cells.

To investigate whether MHC class II-restricted cancer mutations are good vaccine targets in
vivo, we engineered pharmacologically optimized RNA (stabilizing elements in RNA
sequence and liposomal formulation)3–5 encoding B16-M30, one of the epitopes that elicited
strong CD4+ T-cell responses in the B16F10 tumour model. The mutated amino acid was
essential for T-cell recognition, hence the wild type peptide was not recognized (Extended
Data Fig. 2a). When B16F10 tumour-bearing C57BL/6 mice were repeatedly vaccinated
with the B16-M30 RNA monotope, tumour growth was profoundly retarded (Fig. 2a). About
two thirds of the neo-epitope RNA treated mice were still alive at day 100, while all the
control RNA treated mice had died by 65 days. Depletion experiments in B16-M30 RNA
treated mice revealed involvement of CD4+ but not CD8+ T-cells for therapeutic antitumour
efficacy of the neo-epitope (Fig. 2a right).

Similarly, lung metastases of luciferase transduced B16F10 cells were efficiently eradicated
with B16-M30 RNA but not control RNA in the vast majority of mice as shown by
bioluminescence imaging (BLI) (Fig. 2b). Tumour infiltrating leukocytes purified from
tumours of B16-M30 RNA immunized mice strongly reacted against B16-M30 (Fig. 2c). In
tumours from neo-epitope-encoding RNA treated versus control mice, CD4+ as well as
CD8+ T-cell infiltrates were significantly more abundant, whereas MDSCs and FoxP3+ T
cells were significantly reduced (Fig. 2d). To benchmark antitumour efficacy, we tested
immunogenic B16F10 neo-epitopes and a non-mutated TRP2-derived immunodominant
epitope6. Whereas with TRP2 RNA, the two class I and three of the mutated class II neoepitopes conferred a modest non-significant antitumour activity, three class II neo-epitopes
mediated a significant inhibition of tumour growth (Extended Data Fig. 2d). Taken together,
these data establish that a significant proportion of class II neo-epitopes have antitumour
vaccine potency. Establishing B16-M30 as a novel rejection antigen in B16F10 our findings
show that RNA encoding a single neo-epitope may give rise to functional T cells capable of
targeting into the cancer lesion, controlling and even curing murine tumours. Our findings
are in agreement with recent reports of the pivotal role of CD4+ T-cell immunity in the
control of cancer7,8.
The vast majority of mutations are unique to the individual patient. Hence, mutanome
vaccines need to be individually tailored9 and rapidly manufactured on-demand. This
challenge can be viably addressed by RNA vaccine technology (Fig. 3a). At present, GMPgrade RNA is release-ready within 3 weeks. On another note, though we achieved tumour
eradication in mice with a single mutation, to combine several mutations would be
preferable to address tumour heterogeneity and immune editing, which mediate clinical
failure of vaccines in humans10,11. We sought to integrate our insights into a concept which
we call ‘mutanome engineered RNA immunotherapy’ (MERIT) (Fig. 3a).

Author Manuscript

To test this concept, we engineered RNA monotopes encoding four MHC class II (CT26M03, CT26-M20, CT26-M27, CT26-M68) and one MHC class I (CT26-M19) restricted
mutation from the CT26 model (see Extended Data Table 2) and a synthetic RNA pentatope
encoding all five neo-epitopes connected by 10mer non-immunogenic glycine/serine linkers
(Fig. 3a). In naive BALB/c mice the quantity of IFN-γ-producing T cells elicited by the
pentatope was comparable (3 of 5) or even higher than that evoked by the respective
monotope (Extended Data Fig. 3a).

In BALB/c mice with CT26 luciferase-transfected (CT26-Luc) lung metastases vaccinated
repeatedly with a mixture of two RNA pentatopes (3 MHC class I- and 7 class II-restricted
epitopes, Extended Data Table 4) including the mutations tested in the previous experiment,
tumour growth was significantly inhibited (Fig. 3b). At day 32 all mice in the RNA
pentatope group were alive whereas 80% of the control mice had already died. Dissection of
the antitumour activity of single RNA pentatopes in the CT26 model revealed that RNA
pentatope 2 has a very strong antitumour activity, whereas pentatope 1 is modestly active
(Extended Data Fig. 3b). A subsequent study confirmed the antitumour activity of pentatope
2, and showed its significant decrease upon CD40L blockade and complete loss by CD8+ Tcell depletion (Extended Data Fig. 3c). Tumour load in the vaccinated as compared to
untreated mice was significantly lower as shown by post mortem macroscopic (Fig. 3b),
histological (Fig. 3c upper panel) and computerized image analysis (Fig. 3c lower panel
right) of tissue sections. CD3+ T-cell infiltrates in tumour lesions of pentatope RNA
vaccinated mice, in contrast to findings in controls, were significantly brisker as compared to
the surrounding lung tissues (Fig. 3c lower panel left). Moreover, in independent
experiments we found a significant increase of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in tumour lesions of
RNA pentatope immunized mice but a lower FoxP3/CD4 ratio as compared to tumours of
mice treated with irrelevant RNA (Fig. 3c lower panel, Extended Data Fig. 3d).
Taken together our data indicate that with a poly-neo-epitope encoding RNA vaccine T cells
against each single epitope are elicited. These T cells target tumour lesions, recognize their
mutated targets, reshape the cellular composition of the tumour microenvironment and result
in efficient tumour control in vivo.

The current paradigm for selecting mutations for immunization is to employ MHC class I
binding scores for enrichment of mutated epitope candidates12–14 which can elicit CD8+
responses and tumour rejection. Our findings indicate that MHC class II presented neoepitopes may be of higher interest for a MERIT approach. In fact, a correlation analysis
revealed that immunogenic mutations have a significantly better MHC class II binding score
as compared to non-immunogenic ones (Fig. 4a). As most cancers lack MHC class II
expression, effective recognition of neo-epitopes by CD4+ T cells should depend on
presentation of released tumour antigens by antigen presenting cells (APCs). This is most
efficient for highly expressed antigens15. Thus, we implemented an algorithm combining
good MHC class II binding with abundant expression of the mRNA encoding the neoepitope based on confirmed mutated RNA sequencing reads normalized to the overall read
count (NVRC: normalized variant read counts). To test the impact of predicted MHC class II
binding affinity, we ranked CT26 mutanome data with this algorithm and selected the top ten
mutations (‘ME’ mutations in Extended Data Table 5) predicted to be the best MHC class II
binders among the most abundant candidate epitopes (NVRC ≥ 60). The control comprised
ten mutations with abundant expression only (‘E’ mutations in Extended Data Table 5).
These neo-epitopes were used without any further pre-validation or immunogenicity testing
to engineer two RNA pentatopes for each group (PME and PE pentatopes). In mice with
established CT26-Luc lung tumours, PME induced a much stronger T-cell response as
compared to PE pentatopes (Fig. 4c). Analysis of immune responses proved the presence of
multiple immunogenic MHC class II neo-epitopes in the PME RNA pentatopes (Extended
Data Fig. 4). Established lung metastases were completely rejected in almost all PME mice

whereas PE pentatopes were not able to control tumour growth (Fig. 4b). An independent
study confirmed the strong antitumour activity of the pentatope PME and showed loss of the
anti-tumour effect upon anti-CD40L and anti-CD8 treatments (Fig. 4d).
Antigen-specific TH cells promote the cross-priming of tumour-specific cytotoxic T
lymphocyte (CTL) responses by CD40 ligand-mediated activation of dendritic cells. If TH
cells recognize their antigen on the same APC (cross-)presenting an CTL epitope, a
diversified CTL response may result16. In support of this notion, we detected strong CD8+
T-cell responses against gp70-AH1, a well characterized immunodominant CTL epitope of
the endogenous murine leukaemia virus-related cell surface antigen in the blood and spleen
of mice immunized with PME but not PE pentatopes (Fig. 4e). This indicates that cancer neoepitope specific TH cells, in analogy to viral neo-antigen specific T cells, may exert their
antitumour function by augmentation of CTL responses through epitope spreading.

In summary, we show that MHC class II-restricted T-cell epitopes are more abundant than
previously appreciated in the cancer mutanome and can be targeted by customized RNAbased poly-neo-epitope vaccines with substantial therapeutic effect in mouse tumour models.
A recent study reports that about 0.5% of mutations induce spontaneous CD4+ T-cell
immune responses in human tumours17. Even by the most conservative estimate, our
findings indicate that the proportion of relevant neo-epitope vaccine targets recognized by
CD4+ T-cells is a full log higher than that reported to induce spontaneous CD4+ T-cell
responses. The reason might be that spontaneous immunogenicity is not driven by
antigenicity alone, but is a function of many factors including tumour biology and local
immunosuppression. Both B16 (Extended Data Fig. 2e) and CT26 are tumours with strong
immunosuppressive properties, such that they are not able to induce protective immunity
unless transfected with immunomodulators such as GM-CSF. As our study shows that
vaccination with CD4+ T-cell neo-epitopes identified by exome sequencing counteracts the
immunosuppressive tumour microenvironment in these models resulting in rejection of
established tumours, one key prediction from our work is that such ‘poorly immunogenic’
tumours can be successfully targeted through induction of mutation-specific CD4+ T-cell
responses.
A simple explanation for this remarkable frequency of CD4+ T-cell recognition of mutations
may be less stringent length and sequence requirement for peptides binding to MHC class II
molecules as compared to MHC class I epitopes increasing the likelihood that a given
mutation is found within a presented peptide18.

Author Manuscript

The first evidence of spontaneous CD8+ and CD4+ T-cell responses directed against mutated
gene-products in cancer patients was generated in the 1990s19,20. Recent publications have
renewed enthusiasm for the enormous potential of mutation-specific T cells to confer antitumour activity in cancer patients7,8,21. As elegantly proven in a murine carcinogen-induced
sarcoma model22 there is evidence for a direct link between T-cell recognition of mutant
neo-epitopes and clinical response to checkpoint blockade treatment14,23.
To assess whether the principles unraveled in the mouse models for melanoma, colon and
breast cancer are true in the human setting, we analysed mutation and RNA-Seq data in the

same human cancer types provided by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). For all three
human cancers we confirmed the abundance of mutations predicted to bind to MHC class II
(Fig. 4f).
The MERIT approach we presented here by integrating advances in the field of nextgeneration sequencing, computational immunology and synthetic genomics provides the
technology for comprehensive exploitation of the neo-epitope target repertoire. The
approach might be particularly useful to reshape the tumour microenvironment in patients
who lack T-cell infiltration in their tumours and applicable as a standalone or combination
therapy to increase the clinical success rate of checkpoint blockade therapy that depends on
pre-existing immunity24–26. Targeting multiple mutations at once may in theory pave the
way to solve critical problems in current cancer drug development such as clonal
heterogeneity and antigen escape10,12.

Based on the findings of this study and of our prior work, a first-in-concept trial in
melanoma patients1,27,28 has been initiated and is recruiting (NCT02035956), confirming
that ‘just in time’ production of a poly-neo-epitope mRNA cancer vaccine is in fact feasible.

METHODS
Cell lines and mice

Author Manuscript

Female 8–12 weeks old C57BL/6, BALB/c mice (Janvier Labs) and C57BL/6BrdCrHsdTyrc mice (B6 albino, Harlan) were kept in accordance with federal policies on animal
research at the University of Mainz. B16F10 melanoma cell line, CT26 colon carcinoma cell
line and 4T1-luc2-tdtomato (4T1-Luc) cells were purchased in 2010, 2011 and 2011,
respectively (ATCC CRL-6475 lot no. 58078645, ATCC CRL-2638 lot no. 58494154,
Caliper 125669 lot no. 101648). Firefly-luciferase-expressing CT26-Luc and B16F10-Luc
cells were lentivirally transduced. Master and working cell banks were generated
immediately upon receipt, of which third and fourth passages were used for tumour
experiments. Cells were tested for mycoplasma every 3 months. Reauthentification of cells
was not performed since receipt.
Next-generation sequencing and data processing

Author Manuscript

As described previously1, exome capture from mouse tumour cells and tail tissue samples of
BALB/c or C57BL/6 mice were sequenced in triplicate (except 4T1-Luc in duplicate). Oligo
(dT)-based RNA sequencing libraries for gene expression profiling were prepared in
triplicate. Libraries were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq2000 to generate 50 nucleotide
single-end (B16F10) or 100 nucleotide paired-end (CT26, 4T1-Luc) reads, respectively.
Gene expression values were determined by counting reads overlapping transcript exons and
junctions, and normalizing to RPKM expression units (reads which map per kilobase of
transcript length per million mapped reads). Mutation expression was determined by
normalization of mutated RNA reads to the total mapped read counts multiplied by 100
million (normalized variant read counts, NVRC).

Mutation selection, validation and prioritization

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

As described previously1,2,28, mutations were selected based on following criteria: (1)
present in the respective tumour cell line sequencing triplicates and absent in the
corresponding healthy tissue sample triplicates, (2) occur in a RefSeq transcript, (3) cause
non-synonymous changes, and (4) occurrence in expressed genes of tumour cell lines
(median RPKM across replicates). For validation, mutations were amplified from DNA from
the respective cell lines of mice tail tissue and subjected to Sanger sequencing. DNA-derived
mutations were classified as validated if confirmed by either Sanger sequencing or the RNASeq reads. No confirmation via Sanger sequencing and immunogenicity testing was
performed for experiments in Fig. 4. For experiments shown in Fig. 1 mutated epitopes were
prioritized according to their MHC class I binding predicted by the consensus method
(version 2.5) of the Immune Epitope Database (http://www.iedb.org). Mutations shown in
Fig. 4b–e were selected based on either their expression (NVRC) alone or together with their
predicted MHC class II peptide binding capability (IEDB consensus method version 2.5).
Retrospective analysis of MHC II binding prediction shown in Fig. 4a was determined with
IEDB consensus method version 2.12. For analysis of mutations in human tumours, DNA
sequencing data of skin cutaneous melanoma (SKCM, n = 308), colon adenocarcinoma
(COAD, n = 192) or breast invasive carcinoma (BRCA, n = 872) retrieved from The Cancer
Genome Atlas (TCGA) (August 2014) was filtered to obtain genomic non-synonymous
point mutations (nsSNVs). RNA-Seq data (TCGA) of tumour samples with identified
genomic mutations was used to define expressed nsSNVs (STAR aligner, reference genome:
GRCh37/hg19, max. mismatch ratio of 2%). The reads mapping to the reference genome
were intersected with the UCSC gene model database. To predict MHC II binding of
expressed neo-epitopes, seq2HLA29 was employed to identify the patients’ 4-digit HLA
class II (HLA-DQA1, HLA-DQB1, HLA-DRB1) type. The IEDB consensus binding
prediction (version 2.12) was used to predict MHC class II binding from a 27mer peptide
and the patients HLA-DRB1 alleles. As recommended from IEDB, neo-epitopes with a
percentile rank below 10% were considered as binders.
Synthetic RNA and synthetic peptides

Author Manuscript

Non-synonymous mutations were studied in the context of the respective 27mer amino acid
epitope with the mutated amino acid in the centre (position 14). Mutated peptides were
synthesized together with gp70-AH1 (gp70423–431) and control peptides (vesicular stomatitis
virus nucleoprotein (VSV-NP52–59), tyrosinase-related protein 2 (TRP2180–188) by JPT
Peptide Technologies GmbH. Alternatively, sequences encoding mutated 27mer peptides
were cloned into the pST1-Sp-MITD-2hBgUTR-A120 backbone3 featuring sequence
elements for pharmacologically optimized synthetic RNA in terms of translation efficiency
and MHC class I/II processing of epitopes either as mono-topes or fused to each other by
sequences encoding 10 amino acid long glycine-serine linker in between resulting in
pentatopes. Linearization of these plasmid constructs, in vitro translation (IVT) and
purification are described in detail elsewhere3.

Mouse models

Author Manuscript

For immunogenicity studies of mutated epitopes age-matched female C57BL/6 or BALB/c
mice were vaccinated on day 0, 3, 7 and 14 (RNA immunization) or day 0 and 7 (peptide
immunization). The read out was performed five to six days after the last immunization (see
also Enzyme-linked ImmunoSpot and Flow cytometric analysis method sections).
Vaccination was performed either by i.v. injection of 200 μl (20 μg per mutation for B16F10,
40 μg per mutation for CT26) RNA complexed with cationic lipids (manuscript in
preparation) or subcutaneous (s.c.) injection of 100 μg synthetic peptide and 50 μg poly(I:C)
formulated in PBS (200 μl total volume) into the lateral flank. Two mutations per mouse
were tested (n = 5 for B16F10, n = 3 for CT26). For confirmation of immunogenic
mutations and subtyping, mice were vaccinated against a single mutation (n = 5).

Author Manuscript

For therapeutic tumour experiments C57BL/6 mice were inoculated s.c. with 1 × 105
B16F10 melanoma cells into the flank and randomly distributed into treatment groups.
Tumour volume was measured unblinded with a caliper and calculated using the formula (A
× B2)/2 (A as the largest and B the smallest diameter of the tumour). Tumour growth was
documented as mean tumour size with standard error disregarding single distant outliers.

Author Manuscript

In lung metastasis experiments 5 × 105 CT26-Luc or 2× 105 CT26 cells were injected into
the tail vein of BALB/c mice or 1.5 × 105 B16F10-Luc tumour cells into B6 albino mice.
Tumour growth of luciferase transgenic cells was traced unblinded by bioluminescence
imaging after i.p. injection of an aqueous solution of D-luciferin (250 μl, 1.6 mg, BD
Bioscience) on an IVIS Lumina (Caliper Life Sciences). Five minutes after injection emitted
photons were quantified. In vivo bioluminescence in regions of interest (ROI) were
quantified as total flux (photons s−1) (IVIS Living Image 4.0). Mice were randomized based
on their total flux values (ANOVA-P method, Daniel’s XL Toolbox V6.53). CT26 lung
tumour burden was quantified unblinded after tracheal ink (1:10 diluted in PBS) injection
and fixation with Fekete’s solution (5 ml 70% ethanol, 0.5 ml formalin, and 0.25 ml glacial
acetic acid). In therapeutic experiments mice were administered repeated doses of either
monotope (40 μg), pentatope RNA (in total 40 μg) or equimolar amounts of irrelevant RNA.
In some experiments repeated doses (200 μg per mouse i.p.) of CD8-depleting (clone
YTS191, BioXcell), CD4-depleting (clone YTS169.1, BioXcell) or CD40L-blocking (clone
MR1) antibodies were administered. The experimental group sizes were approved by the
regulatory authorities for animal welfare after being defined to balance statistical power,
feasibility and ethical aspects.
Enzyme-linked ImmunoSpot (ELISpot)

As previously described30, 5 × 105 splenocytes were cultured over night at 37 °C in antiINF-γ (10 μg ml−1, clone AN18, Mabtech) coated Multiscreen 96-well plates (Millipore)
and cytokine secretion was detected with an anti-IFN-γ antibody (1 μg ml−1, clone R4-6A2,
Mabtech). For stimulation either 2 μg ml−1 peptide was added or spleen cells were
coincubated with 5 × 104 syngeneic bone-marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDC)
transfected with RNA. For analysis of tumour infiltrating lymphocytes, single-cell
suspensions of lung metastasis were rested overnight to get rid of living tumour cells via
plastic adherence. Viable cells were separated via density gradient centrifugation and added

to the ELISpot plate. For analysis of T-cell responses in peripheral blood, PBMC were
isolated via density gradient centrifugation, counted and restimulated by addition of peptide
and syngeneic BMDC. Subtyping of T-cell responses was performed with an MHC class II
blocking antibody (20 μg ml−1, clone M5/114, BioXcell). All samples were tested in
duplicates or triplicates.
Flow cytometric analysis

Author Manuscript

In the presence of Brefeldin A (Sigma-Aldrich) 2 × 106 splenocytes were stimulated with 2
× 105 RNA-transfected BMDC or 2 μg ml−1 peptide. Splenocytes treated with phorbol 12myristate 13-acetate (PMA, 0.5 μg ml−1, Sigma-Aldrich) and Ionomycin (1 μg ml−1, SigmaAldrich) served as a positive control. Cells were incubated for 5 h at 37 °C, stained for CD4+
and CD8+ cell surface markers, permeabilized and fixed using BD Cytofix/Cytoperm
according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Thereafter cells were stained for INF-γ, TNF-α
and IL-2 cytokines (BD Biosciences). Cytokine secretion among CD4+ or CD8+ T cells in
stimulated samples was compared to control samples (medium, irrelevant RNA or irrelevant
peptide) in order to determine the responding T-cell subtype (n = 5). Tumour infiltrating
leucocytes were prepared from subcutaneous B16F10 tumours fifteen to twenty days after
inoculation. Tumours were harvested and minced into pieces of 1–2 mm diameter. The
resulting cell suspension was harvested, filtered through a 70-μm cell strainer, washed two
times and stained for CD4, CD8, Gr-1 and CD11b surface marker. Intracellular FoxP3
staining was performed according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Mouse Foxp3 Buffer Set,
BD). Samples were acquired on a BD FACSCanto II.
Immune histochemistry

Lungs of CT26 tumour bearing mice were fixed overnight in 4% phosphate buffered
formaldehyde solution (Carl Roth) and embedded in paraffin. 50-μm consecutive sections (3
per mouse) were stained for CD3 (clone SP7, Abcam), CD4 (clone 1, catalogue no. 50134M08H, Sino Biologinal) and FoxP3 (polyclonal, catalogue no. NB100-39002, Novus
Biologicals) following detection by a HRP-conjugated antibody (Poly-HRP-anti-rabbit IgG,
ImmunoLogic) and the corresponding peroxidase substrate (Vector Nova Red, Vector
Laboratories) and counterstained with hematoxylin. CD3+, CD4+, FoxP3+ and tumour areas
were captured on an Axio Scan.Z1 (Zeiss) and manually pre-defined tumour and lung
regions were quantified via computerized image analysis software (Tissue Studio 3.6.1,
Definiens). CD8+ area was calculated by subtracting CD4 stained area from CD3+ area. For
comparison of tumour areas between control and pentatope1 +2-treated animals, tumour-free
sections were excluded.

Immunofluorescence staining
8-μm sections of cryo-conserved organs were attached on Superfrost slides, dried overnight
at room temperature and fixed in 4% para-formaldehyde (PFA) for 10 min at room
temperature in the dark. Sections were washed 3 times with PBS and blocked using PBS
supplemented with 1% BSA, 5% mouse serum, 5% rat serum and 0.02% Nonident for 1 h at
room temperature in the dark. Fluorescent labelled antibodies (FoxP3, clone FJK-16 s,
eBioscience; CD8, clone 53-6.7, BD; CD4, clone RM4-5, BD) were diluted in staining
buffer (PBS supplemented with 1% BSA, 5% mouse serum and 0.02% Nonident) and

sections were stained overnight at 4 °C. After washing twice with washing buffer (PBS
supplemented with 1% BSA and 0. 02% Nonident) and once with PBS, slides were stained
for 3 min with Hoechst (Sigma), washed 3 times with PBS, once with distilled water and
mounted using Mounting Medium Flouromount G (eBioscience). Immunofluorescence
images were acquired using an epifluorescence microscope (ApoTome, Zeiss). Tumour,
CD4, CD8 and FoxP3 stained areas were quantified within manually pre-defined tumour
regions via computerized image analysis software (Tissue Studio 3.6.1., Definiens). The
proportion of marker positive cells in comparison to DAPI positive cells was calculated.
Statistics

Author Manuscript

Means were compared by using Student’s t-test for hypothesis testing to compare individual
treatment and corresponding control groups. In case of significantly different variances (Ftest, alpha = 0.05) Welch’s correction was used. Mann–Whitney U test was applied if data
sets failed the Pearson omnibus normality test (alpha = 0.05). Tumour growth was compared
by calculating the area under the tumour growth curve (AUC) for single mice. Statistical
differences in medians between two groups were calculated with a nonparametric Mann–
Whitney U test. Survival benefit was determined with the log-rank test. All analyses were
two-tailed (except Fig. 4c, e) and carried out using GraphPad Prism 5.03. n.s.: P > 0.05, *P ≤
0.05, **P ≤ 0.01, ***P ≤ 0.001. Grubb’s test was used for identification of outliers (alpha =
0.05). No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample size.

Figure 1. Cancer-associated mutations are frequently immunogenic and pre-dominantly
recognized by CD4+ T cells

Author Manuscript

a, Schematic describing mutation discovery and immunogenicity testing. b–d, Splenocytes
of mice vaccinated with peptides and polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (polyI:C) (b, B16F10,
n = 5) or immunized with antigen-encoding RNA (c, CT26, n = 5; d, 4T1, n = 3) were tested
for recognition of mutated peptides by ELISpot. Subsequent subtyping was performed via
MHC II blockade or intracellular cytokine and CD4/CD8 surface staining. Pie charts
represent the prevalence of non-immunogenic, MHC class I- or II-restricted mutated
epitopes. b, Right, subtyping of mutation-specific T cells. c, Right, MHC restriction of neoepitopes prioritized based on either good (0.1–2.1) or poor (>3.9) MHC I binding scores.

untreated (control) or B16-M30 immunized C57BL/6 mice (n = 10) inoculated
subcutaneously (s.c.) with B16F10. b, B6 albino mice (n = 8) developing lung metastases
upon intravenous (i.v.) injection of B16F10-Luc were treated with B16-M30 or irrelevant
RNA (control). Median tumour growth was determined by BLI as photons per second. c,
Single-cell suspensions of B16F10 tumours of irrelevant (control) or B16-M30 RNA
immunized mice (n = 4) were restimulated with B16-M30 or irrelevant peptide (vesicular
stomatitis virus nucleoprotein, VSV-NP52–59) and tested by ELISpot (mean + s.e.m.). Data
pooled from two experiments. d, Frequency of infiltrating cells in s.c. B16F10 tumours (n =
