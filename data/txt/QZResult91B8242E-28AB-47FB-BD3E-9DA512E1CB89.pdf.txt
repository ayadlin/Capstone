ABSTRACT
Amplification and overexpression of c-Myc is commonly seen in human ovarian
cancers, and this could be a potentially novel therapeutic target for this disease.
JQ1, a selective small-molecule BET bromodomain (BRDs) inhibitor, has been found
to suppress tumor progression in several cancer cell types. Using ovarian cancer cell
lines, a transgenic mouse model, and primary cell cultures from human ovarian cancer
tissues, we demonstrated that JQ1 significantly suppressed cellular proliferation and
induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in ovarian cancer cells and mouse model
via targeting c-Myc. In addition, JQ1 had multiple influences on cancer metabolism,
particularly in the aerobic glycolysis pathway. JQ1 reduced both the activity and
phosphorylation of LDHA, inhibited lactate production, and decreased the energy
supply to ovarian cancer cell lines and tumors. Taken together, our findings suggest
that JQ1 is an efficacious anti-tumor agent in ovarian cancer that is associated with
cell cycle arrest, induction of apoptosis and alterations of metabolism.

shown that using small molecules to target c-Myc might
be a potent strategy for ovarian cancer treatment [2, 3].
Abnormal activation of c-Myc is thought to be
involved in tumor initiation and development in many
types of human cancers, including breast cancer, prostate
cancer, lung carcinoma, glioblastoma and ovarian cancer
[4]. c-Myc is a transcription factor and functions as a DNAbinding transcriptional activator upon heterodimerization
with Max to control about 30% of human genes [4, 5],
which subsequently regulates the expression of multiple
genes involved in cellular growth, proliferation and
differentiation [6]. Knockdown of c-Myc in cancer cells in
vitro appears to uniformly reduce cell proliferation and in
some instances induce apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. In

INTRODUCTION
Epithelial ovarian cancer is the leading cause of
death from gynecological malignancies, and more than
14,000 deaths are estimated as a result of ovarian cancer
in the United States this year [1]. Unfortunately, the
incidence of ovarian cancer is on the rise, and more than
70% of patients will face relapse and ultimately die of their
disease. The high mortality rate can be attributed to the fact
that more than two thirds of patients present with late-stage
disease at diagnosis, and most of them eventually develop
resistance to platinum based chemotherapy. Therefore, it
is urgent that we explore novel treatment approaches for
ovarian cancer. Recent molecular profiling studies have

c-Myc transgenic mouse models, blocking ectopic c-Myc
expression inhibits the growth of established tumors,
suggesting that it is involved in tumor maintenance.
Deregulation of c-Myc plays an important role in activating
many transcriptional programs that influence cell division,
metabolic adaptation, and survival [7, 8]. Overexpression
of c-Myc often correlates with late stage cancers, poor
cellular differentiation, local and distant metastases, and
poor prognosis in human malignancies, including breast
cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, gastric cancer, large
B-cell lymphoma, and ovarian cancer [9–14].
Previous studies using siRNA, shRNA, and small
molecule inhibitors have validated the relevance of the
c-Myc and its downstream genes and have proved them
to be feasible therapeutic strategies for tumor treatment
[8]. Several strategies have been used to target the c-Myc,
including inhibition of c-Myc expression, suppression
of Myc-Max dimerization, inhibition of Myc-Max DNA
binding, and interference of key c-Myc related targets.
JQ1 is a novel small molecule that selectively targets
and inhibits actions of bromodomain-containing proteins
(BRDs), thereby suppressing the tumor through the
downregulation of c-Myc and its downstream targets
[15]. JQ1 has been used in preclinical models with varied
success in a few cancers including leukemia, glioblastoma,
lung adenocarcinoma, and other malignancies [16–19].

In this study, our goal was to evaluate the potential
of JQ1 on cell growth of ovarian cancer cell lines, primary
ovarian cancer culture cells and an ovarian cancer mouse
model. Comprehensive in vitro and in vivo studies in
ovarian cancer reveal that the anti-cancer function of
JQ1 affects multiple signaling pathways that regulate
cell proliferation, cell cycle, apoptosis, cellular stress,
metabolism, and metastasis. These results indicate that JQ1
demonstrates promise as a targeted agent for ovarian cancer.

RESULTS
JQ1 inhibited cell proliferation in ovarian cancer
cells
We first investigated the effects of JQ1 on the growth
of ovarian cancer cells and c-Myc protein expression. The
ovarian cancer cell lines, Hey and SKOV3, were incubated
for 72 hours with varying concentrations of JQ1. The
results from the MTT assay showed a progressive decrease
in cell proliferation with successive increases in the
concentrations of the JQ1 (Figure 1A). After 72 hours of
treatment, the IC50 of JQ1 on Hey and SKOV3 cells was
360 nM and 970 nM respectively, and the results indicated
that the Hey cells were more sensitive to JQ1 than SKOV3
cells. To determine whether JQ1 effectively targets c-Myc,

western blotting was performed for the Hey and SKOV3
cells after exposure to JQ1 for 24 hours. Both cell lines
expressed high levels of the c-Myc protein, which was
significantly suppressed by JQ1 in a dose dependent
manner (Figure 1B and 1C).

and reduced S phase in the SKOV3 cell line, after 24
hours of exposure (Figure 3A–3C). To further characterize
JQ1 induced cell cycle arrest, cell cycle related proteins
were analyzed in JQ1 treated ovarian cancer cells. JQ1
downregulated cyclin D1, CDK4 and CDK6 protein
expression and upregulated cell cycle inhibitor p21
expression in Hey and SKOV3 cells (Figure 3D and 3E).
These results suggest that JQ1 inhibits ovarian cancer cell
growth through the induction of apoptosis and cell cycle
arrest.

JQ1 induced cellular apoptosis and cell cycle
arrest
In order to evaluate the cytotoxic effects induced
by JQ1, ovarian cancer cells were stained with PI and
Annexin V to measure the total apoptotic and necrotic
cell populations. While the total apoptotic cell population
(mainly the early apoptosis) increased significantly in a
dose dependent manner after incubation with JQ1 for 24
hours, the necrotic cell population remained unchanged
in the Hey and SKOV3 cells (Figure 2A–2C). Analysis
of the different phases of the cell cycle after treatment
with JQ1 demonstrated cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase.
While the G1 cell population increased from 53% to 85%,
the S phase decreased from 18% to 8% with increasing
concentrations of JQ1 (0 to 1000 nM) in the Hey cells.
Consistently, JQ1 treatment also induced G1 phase arrest

JQ1 induced cell stress
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been
implicated in cellular activity relating to a variety of stress
responses and are involved in mediation of apoptosis via
damage to the mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum
(ER). We found that JQ1 decreased the production of
ROS in both cell lines in a dose dependent manner, as
observed through the alterations of DCFDA fluorescence
(Figure 4A). Because ROS plays a role in the induction
of mitochondrial dysfunction and c-Myc regulates
mitochondrial biogenesis, we also examined the effects

of the JQ1 on the mitochondrial potential by JC-1 assay.
We measured the mitochondrial potential (Δ ψm) by JC-1
staining in the Hey and SKOV3 cell lines after treatment
with JQ1. Treatment with JQ1 for 2 hours significantly
reduced the mitochondrial potential, suggesting that JQ1
specifically induces the mitochondrial dysfunction (Figure
4B). Given that treatment of tumor cells with anti-cancer
agents is known to induce significant ER stress shortly
after exposure. Our western blotting showed that JQ1
(500 nM) increased the expression of perk, bip and
calnexin (markers for ndoplasmic reticulum stress, ER
stress) as early as 3–6 hours of after treatment in the Hey
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

and SKOV3 cells, which is further evidence of ER stress
induction by JQ1 (Figure 4C–4F).

JQ1 inhibited LDHA activity
To explore the underlying mechanism of the various
cellular and molecular effects induced by JQ1 in ovarian
cancer cells, we performed gene expression profiling on
the Hey cell line treated with JQ1 in a time lapse manner
(0, 12, 24 hours). JQ1 (500 nM) significantly impacted four
specific gene groups: c-Myc and its downstream targets,
apoptosis associated genes, cell cycle associated genes,
6919

and metabolism associated genes. JQ1 decreased c-Myc
expression and increased p21 level as early as 12 hours
after treatment, but had little influence on p27 mRNA
levels. Among the cyclins and CDKs, JQ1 decreased
CDK4 expression, a known downstream target of c-Myc,
the most dramatically. JQ1 also increased BCL-2 and
MCL-1 moderately, consistent with JQ1’s effects on
induction of apoptosis (Figure 5A).
In regards to the enzymes of the glycolysis pathway,
LDHA (Lactate dehydrogenase A) mRNA expression
decreased more substantially than the expression of other
related enzymes under JQ1 treatment (Figure 5B). Given
that c-Myc regulates many metabolic pathways and that
JQ1 dramatically affects several genes involved in the
regulation of glycolysis, we next investigated the effect
of JQ1 on the functional properties of LDHA in both cell
lines. The western blotting results showed JQ1 decreased
the expression of LDHA and its phosphorylation after
24 hours in the Hey and SKOV3 cells, as compared
to untreated cells (Figure 5C and 5D). Similarly, the
enzymatic activity of LDHA and lactate production in
the ovarian cancer cells was also reduced after treatment
with JQ1, as evaluated by ELISA assay (Figure 5E and
5F). To further analyze the effect of JQ1 on glycolysis
in ovarian cancer cells, the cellular ATP level, which is
a major energy source for glycolysis in cancer cells, and
glucose uptake, which is regulated by glycolysis, were
assayed. We found that the ATP level and glucose uptake
activity were reduced in JQ1 treated cells after 24 hours
treatment (Figure 5G and 5H). These data suggest that
JQ1, through inhibition of c-Myc, may be a promising
glycolysis inhibitor in cancer cell metabolism.
Given that reduction of LDHA activity by siRNA
and small molecule inhibitors could induce oxidative
stress and cell death, we further analyzed the role of
LDHA in the reduced vitality of ovarian cancer cells
being treated by JQ1. We hypothesized that LDHA
might be required for accentuating the inhibitive effect
of JQ1, and reduced LDHA expression would increase
the functional effects of JQ1 in the treatment of ovarian
cancer cells. Hence, we selected a specific siRNA to
block LDHA expression in Hey cells (Figure 6A). As we
expected, reduction of LDHA expression with siRNA
markedly decreased cell proliferation (Figure 6B).
Treatment with JQ1 at 24 hours after transfection of
siRNA partially increased cell viability compared with
JQ1 treated cells, which is characterized by partial rescue
of cell cycle processes and reduced labeling of Annexin V
(Figure 6C and 6D). We then sought to determine whether
reduced cellular ATP and lactate production, induced by
JQ1, could be rescued by the LDHA knockdown using a
specific siRNA. We found that LDHA knockdown mostly
suppressed the reduction of cellular ATP and lactate levels
after treatment with JQ1 for 24 hours (Figure 6E and 6F).
Our results suggest that reduction of LDHA levels or
activity by JQ1 triggers cell viability, and that LDHA plays
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

an influential role in the mediation of cell proliferation and
metabolism in the JQ1 treated ovarian cancer cells.

JQ1 suppressed tumor growth in orthotopic
mouse ovarian cancer model
To validate the anti-tumorigenic potential of JQ1
in vivo, we utilized an orthotopic serous ovarian cancer
mouse model by injecting M909 cells into the ovary
bursa of female mice (Figure 7A). After 7–14 days of
injection, palpation and autopsy confirmed ovarian
cancer growth in all mice. We began JQ1 treatment
(intraperitoneal injection, 50 mg/kg/day) on the mice
10–12 days after the injection of the M909 cancer cells.
Tumor growth during the treatment was monitored by
palpation twice a week. During the treatment, the mice
showed tolerance to JQ1 injections and maintained
normal activities. Regular twice-weekly measurements
yielded no changes in blood glucose or weight (data
not shown). After 4 weeks of treatment, the mice were
euthanized, and the ovarian tumors were removed,
photographed, and weighed (Figure 7B). The results
showed a substantial reduction in tumor growth in the
JQ1 treated group in comparison with the untreated
group (Figure 7C). The JQ1 treatment group presented
with tumor weights and volumes substantially lower than
those of the controls (Figure 7D and 7E), indicating the
efficacy of the JQ1 in ovarian cancer regression.
To further confirm the effect of JQ1 on LDHA activity
in vivo, LDHA activity in the tumor tissues and serum
lactate levels were assayed. As expected, JQ1 markedly
decreased LDHA activity and lactate levels in comparison
to the untreated control mice (Figure 7F). Furthermore, the
expression of Ki 67, c-Myc, cleaved caspase 3 and p-LDHA
were also evaluated by IHC. Consistent with our data in
vitro, the expression of c-Myc and p-LDHA was reduced
in mice treated with JQ1 but not in the untreated mice.
Similarly, the levels of Ki 67 were significantly reduced
following JQ1 treatment compared to the untreated controls,
whereas JQ1 increased the levels of cleaved caspase 3 in
treated mice (Figure 7G and 7H). As the expression of
Ki 67 and cleaved caspase 3 have been correlated to cell
proliferation and apoptosis, their alterations substantiated
our findings that inhibition c-Myc expression by JQ1 can
decrease tumor size and weight in vivo.

JQ1 inhibited proliferation of ovarian cancer
cells derived from patients
It is thought that primary cancer cell culture may
have a stronger capability of predicting realistic drug
sensitivity than immortalized cancer cell lines [20, 21].
We further investigated the effects of JQ1 on tumor cell
growth in primary cultures of ovarian cancer cells by MTT
assay, After 72 hours of treatment, 6 of the 7 individual
patient cultures responded to the JQ1 treatment, showing

an achievable IC50 (range from 180 nM to 1150 nM)
(Figure 8A and 8B). Consistently, a decreased lactate level
was detected in all six of the primary cell cultures that
were sensitive to JQ1 (Figure 8C). In order to determine
if the level of c-Myc protein expression was related to
the sensitivity to JQ1 in ovarian cancer cells, we detected
c-Myc protein expression using Western blotting in the
seven untreated primary cell cultures, Hey and SKOV3
cells. The results revealed the abundant expression of
c-Myc in the seven primary cultures and both the Hey and
SKOV3 cells (Figure 8D, Figure 1B). An analysis of the
data using a linear regression model showed that the JQ1
IC50 was independent upon the expression of c-Myc in
the primary culture cells and both the cell lines (data not
shown). These results indicate that JQ1 may be a valuable
anti-cancer agent in ovarian cancer therapy.

30 years. The key to successful targeted molecular
therapies against this lethal malignancy is the identification
of critical, active oncogenes in oncogenic networks whose
effective inhibition will result in the abrogation and/or
reversal of the malignant state by induction of apoptosis
and/or cellular differentiation in cancer cells. c-Myc is
reported to be broadly involved in many cancers, in which
its expression or amplification is estimated to be elevated
or deregulated in up to 70% of human cancers [6, 22].
High levels of c-Myc expression have been linked to more
aggressive ovarian cancers [13, 23]. Transgenic mouse
models showed that reduced c-Myc expression resulted in
tumor regression, providing evidence that tumor stability
depends heavily on the activity of c-Myc. Given the fact
that c-Myc is relevant to multiple cell signaling pathways
that promote survival, progression, and metastasis of
ovarian cancer cells, targeting c-Myc and its target
genes provides a unique opportunity for ovarian cancer
treatment. Recent studies have proved that activation
of c-Myc could be inhibited by JQ1, a small molecule
inhibitor targeting bromodomain proteins (BRDs),
resulting in a remarkable inhibition of cancer cell growth
and response in many cancer models in mice [24, 25].

DISCUSSION
Ovarian cancer is the most lethal gynecologic
malignancy and ranks as the fourth most common cause
of cancer-related deaths. However, there have been few
improvements in ovarian cancer treatment over the last

Inhibition of c-Myc by small molecular inhibitors
has been investigated in cancer therapeutics over last
several years, but to date, due to low potency or efficiency,
no inhibitors have been effectively incorporated into
routine chemotherapies. The present study is the first to
demonstrate that JQ1 reduces the viability of ovarian
cancer cells and primary cultured ovarian cancer cells by
inducing apoptosis (through the downregulation of MCL1 and BCL-2), cell cycle arrest (through upregulation of
p21 and p27, downregulation of cyclin D1, CDK4 and
CDK6), and by inhibiting ovarian cell migration and
metabolism. By decreasing c-Myc expression in our
orthotopically transplanted serous ovarian cancer mouse
model, JQ1 ultimately led to a decrease in tumor volume,
following reduction in Ki 67 expression and an increase
in cleaved caspase 3 levels.
One of the hallmarks of cancer cells is an increased
dependence on glycolytic metabolism and the production
of large quantities of lactate regardless of oxygen
availability, which is known as the Warburg effect [26,
27]. It is featured by the high flux of glucose into tumor
cells even in a non-hypoxic microenvironment, ending
with the conversion of pyruvate into lactate and resulting
in a high production of lactate to generate sufficient energy
for the demands of rapidly proliferating tumor cells [28–
30]. Based on previous reports, c-Myc appears to be an
important transcription factor for glucose metabolism
both in normal and cancer tissues [7, 31]. Overexpression
of c-Myc induces the expression of glycolytic enzymes
such as lactate dehydrogenase-A (LDHA), glucose
transporter-1 (GLUT1), hexokinase-2 (HK2) and increases
glycolysis in most cancer cells [32]. In our study, JQ1
significantly decreased cellular glucose uptake and ATP
and lactate production in ovarian cancer cells. Metabolic
alterations may also play a crucial role in chemoresistance
in patients with ovarian cancer [33], and future studies
will be focused on whether JQ1 may aid in overcoming
chemoresistance in this disease. In addition, the targeting
of key control points of glycolysis is emerging as a novel
strategy in regards to cancer therapy, further supporting
the use of JQ1 which is able to target both proliferative
and metabolic pathways.
Among the glycolytic enzymes, lactate
dehydrogenase A (LDHA) is unique as it is essential
to maintain the rapid regeneration of NAD+ [34]. The
upregulated expression and activity of LDHA has been
detected in breast cancer, pancreatic cancer, melanoma
and ovarian cancer and has been significantly associated
with poor prognosis [35–39]. In both in vitro and in vivo
studies, silencing LDHA by either RNA interference or
small molecule inhibitors has been found to significantly
suppress tumor initiation and progression [40, 41].
Given that most normal tissues are not LDHA(lactate)dependent, targeting LDHA is proposed to be a promising
therapeutic strategy for specifically targeting cancer cells
over normal cells [41, 42]. Previously, c-Myc had been
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

found to be able to activate the transcription of LDHA
via binding to the Myc/Max binding sites located in the
promoter of LDHA [43]. In regards to our microarray data,
JQ1 significantly inhibited LDHA mRNA expression,
which subsequently reduced phosphorylation of LDHA
and LDHA activity. Knockdown of LDHA was shown
to eliminate the suppressive effects of JQ1 on cancer
cell proliferation and glycolysis. More importantly,
JQ1 treatment not only reduced tumor growth but also
decreased LDHA activity and lactate levels in our mouse
model. The correlation between JQ1 treatment and LDHA
activity has been documented recently by other research
groups via genome-wide expression profiling analysis in
acute lymphoblastic leukemia [44]. Taken together with
other studies, our results support that beyond its antiproliferative properties, JQ1 is an effective inhibitor of
glycolysis through the targeting of LDHA, a key rate
limiting enzyme of glycolysis in ovarian cancer [32, 45].
It is thought that primary cancer cell culture, in
evaluating the efficacy of anti-cancer agents, has greater
sensitivity than cancer cell lines and provides high-fidelity
data for translating in vitro findings into clinical settings
[20, 21]. In a panel of 7 primary cell cultures from serous
ovarian cancer patients, 6 cases showed diverse ranges
of IC50 (180–1150 nM) and relatively decreased lactate
levels after 72 hours of JQ1 treatment, providing further
support for the use of JQ1 as a targeted therapy for ovarian
cancer.
Potent cytotoxicity and efficacy of JQ1 toward
a wide range of cancer cell lines and in vivo preclinical models has been extensively investigated
worldwide, making JQ1 an attractive candidate for
further investigation as a potential anti-cancer agent in
clinical trials in the near future, including that of ovarian
cancer based on our studies. A deeper understanding of
the underlying molecular mechanisms of JQ1’s antitumorigenic activity will allow for more tailored treatment
regimens and the possibility to combine JQ1 with other
complementary cytotoxic and targeted therapeutics to
achieve the most synergistic results in tumor regression.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Ovarian cancer cell lines and reagents
The medium were RPMI 1640 with 5% fetal bovine
serum for Hey and M909, and DMEM/F12 with 10%
fetal bovine serum for SKOV3. Hey and SKOV3 were
purchased from ATCC (American type culture collection,
USA). The M909 cell line was established in our laboratory
from the T121+ p53f/f Brcar1f/f serous ovarian cancer mouse
model [46]. These cell lines were cultured under standard
conditions at 37°C in a humidified incubator containing
5% CO2. JQ1 was a kindly gift by Dr. James E. Bradner
(Harvard medical school, MA, USA). The non-fat milk,
20% bull serum albumin (BSA) and RNase A were

purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO, USA ), and all the
primary antibodies for c-Myc, LDHA, p-LDHA, cyclin

perk, bip, calnexin and α-tubulin were obtained from Cell
Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA, USA).

transferred to PVDF membrane, blocked in 5% non-fat
milk and incubated with the primary antibodies overnight
at 4°C. Subsequently, the membranes were incubated
with the appropriate secondary antibodies for 1 hour at
room temperature before development. The bands were
developed and quantified using an Alpha Innotech Imaging
System (San Leandro, CA, USA). After developing,
the membranes were stripped or washed and re-probed
using antibodies against total LDHA (for p-LDHA) and
α-tubulin (for all proteins), respectively. Each experiment
was repeated three times to assess for consistency of
results. α-tubulin was used as the endogenous control.

Ovarian cancer tissue samples collection and
primary cell culture
Seven tumor specimens were sampled from patients
undergoing surgery for serous ovarian carcinoma at the
University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC-CH).
The protocol was reviewed and exemption granted by
the Institutional Review Board at UNC-CH. Tumors
were staged and graded according to the criteria of the
International Federation of Obstetrics and Gynecology
(FIGO, 2009). For the culture of primary ovarian cancer
cells, the freshly obtained tissues were washed three
times with Hank’s Buffered Salt Solution (HBSS), and
then gently minced by scissors in DMEM/F12 medium
containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). These tissues
were then digested in 0.2% collagenase IA, 100 U/ml
penicillin and streptomycin for 30–60 minutes at 37°C
water bath with shaking. After two centrifugations with
PBS solution, cells were re-suspended and diluted to
1 × 105 cells/ml with DMEM/F12 medium. Subsequently,
1 × 104 cells/well were seeded into 96-well plates
and incubated for 24 hours before JQ1 treated. Cell
proliferation was measured by MTT assay 72 hours after
JQ1 treatment.

Cell cycle analysis
The effect of JQ1 on the cell cycle was measured
using Cellometer (Nexcelom, Lawrence, MA, USA).
Briefly, 2.5 × 105 cells/well were seeded into 6-well plates
and incubated overnight, then treated with JQ1 (from 0
to 1000 nM) for 24 hours. The cells were harvested and
washed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS), the pellet
was re-suspended and fixed in 90% pre-chilled methanol
and stocked overnight at −20°C. The cells were then
washed with PBS again and re-suspended in 50 μl RNase
A solution (250 μg/ml, 10 mM EDTA) for 30 minutes
and then 50 μl staining solution [containing 2 mg/ml PI
(Biotium, Hayward, MA, USA), 0.1 mg/ml Azide (Sigma),
and 0.05% Triton X-100 (Sigma)] was added into. The
final mixture was incubated for 15 minutes in dark before
analyzed on Cellometer. The results were analyzed using
FCS4 express software. The experiments were performed
in triplicate and repeated three times.

Proliferation assay
The impact of JQ1 on the cellular proliferation
of Hey, SKOV3 and primary culture of human ovarian
cancer cells was determined by MTT assay. Briefly, 4 × 103
cells/well were seeded into 96-well plates and incubated
overnight with the indicated medium, then treated with
different doses of JQ1 (from 0 to 10000 nM) for 72 hours.
Subsequently, 5 μl MTT (5 mg/ml; Sigma, St. Louis, MO,
USA) was added into each well and incubated for 1 hour.
The MTT reaction was terminated by the addition of 100
μl DMSO. The results were determined by measuring the
absorbance at 570 nm with a microplate reader (Tecan,
Morrisville, NC, USA). The effect of JQ1 was calculated
as a relative percentage of control cell growth obtained
from DMSO (0.1%) treated cells grown in the same 96well plates. Each experiment was performed in triplicate
and repeated three times to assess for consistency of results.

Apoptosis assay
JQ1 induced apoptosis was detected with PI/
Annexin V staining kit (Biolegend, San Diego, CA, USA).
Briefly, 2.5 × 105 cells/well were seeded into 6-well plates
and incubated overnight, then treated with JQ1 (from
0 to 1000 nM) for 24 hours. The cells were then collected,
washed with PBS, and re-suspended in the 100 μl binding
buffer. One μl of Annexin V and 0.5 μl of propidium
iodide (10 mg/ml) were added in the binding buffer for
15 minutes in the dark. The samples were immediately
measured by Cellometer. The results were analyzed by
FCS4 express software. The total apoptotic cells (early
apoptosis+late apoptosis) were expressed as a percentage
of the total number of cells stained. All experiments were
performed in triplicate and repeated three times to assess
for consistency of response.

Western blot analysis

Mitochondrial membrane potential
measurement

Total protein was extracted from ovarian cancer
cells or tissues using RIPA buffer (Thermo Fisher, MA,
USA) and quantified with the BCA assay kit (Thermo
Fisher). Equal amounts (30–50 μg) of total protein were
loaded and separated by 10–12% SDS-PAGE, then
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

JC-1 (5,5’,6,6’-tetrachloro-1,1’,3,3’-tetraethylben
zimidazolcarbocyanine iodide, Invitrogen, Grand Island,
NY, USA) was used to detect changes of the mitochondrial

membrane potential. 1 × 106 cells/well were seeded into
6-well plates and incubated overnight, then the cells
were treated with JQ1 for 2 hours and stained with JC-1
(200 μM) for 15 minutes in the dark, and measured by
Cellometer. The results were analyzed by FCS4 express
software. All experiments were performed in triplicate and
repeated three times.

5 × 103 cells were seeded in 96-well plates and incubated
overnight, followed by the treatment with different doses
of JQ1 for 24 hours. Then, 100 μl/well ATP assay solution
was added into and mixed gently, incubate for 20 minutes at
room temperature. The luminescence intensity was measured
in luminometer mode on a plate reader. Finally, all the results
were normalized on the basis of the total protein derived from
the cells treated exactly as the ATP group. The experiments
were performed in triplicate and repeated three times.

RNA interference experiments
siRNAs targeting human LDHA (SI00078897) were
purchased from Qiagen Company (Hilden, Germany).
Transfection of siRNAs was performed using the
Qiagen Hiperfect transfection reagent according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, 1 × 106 cells/well
were seeded into the 6-well plates and incubated overnight,
and then a mixture consisting of 75 ng of si-LDHA and
5 μl Qiagen Hiperfect was added into the medium. 48
hours later, the cells were harvested for western blot and
other assays. A scramble siRNA was used as the negative
control. The experiments were repeated in triplicate.

Glucose uptake assay
The glucose uptake assay was performed using
2-[N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)amino]-2-deoxyD-glucose (2-NBDG; Invitrogen), followed by detection
of fluorescence produced by the cells [45]. 24 hours
after treated with JQ1, the Hey and SKOV3 cells were
incubated with 2-NBDG (100 μM) with glucose free
medium for 15 minutes. The 2-NBDG uptake reaction
was stopped by removing the medium and washing the
cells twice with 200 μl HBSS. Fluorescence (excitation/
emission [Ex/Em] = 485/535) was measured using the
plate reader. Relative glucose was assayed compared with
untreated control. All the experiments were performed in
triplicate and repeated three times.

Lactate production assay
Lactate production in the medium was detected by
using the Lactate Assay Kit (BioVision, Mountain View,
CA, USA). Briefly, at the finish of JQ1 treatment, 2 μl
corresponding medium was taken for the lactate assay. The
medium was mixed with reaction buffer and incubated for
30 minutes at 37°C in the dark. Fluorescence was then
measured at Ex/Em = 535/587 nm on a microplate reader.
Results were normalized on the basis of the total protein
concentration of each sample. All the experiments were
performed in triplicate and repeated twice.

Reactive oxygen species (ROS) assay
The Fluorimetric Intracellular Total ROS Activity
Assay Kit (AAT bioquest) was used to detect the alteration
of total production of reactive oxygen species caused by
JQ1. Briefly, 1 × 104 Hey and SKOV3 cells were pre-stained
by the ROS working solution for 1 hour and then treated by
JQ1 for 30 minutes. The fluorescence was monitored at Ex/
Em = 490/525 nm on the plate reader. All the experiments
were performed in triplicate and repeated three times.

LDHA activity assay
Alterations of cellular LDHA activity were
determined using the LDHA Activity Assay Kit
(BioVision), following the manufacturer’s instructions.
Briefly, 2 × 105 cells/well were seeded into 6-well plates
and incubated overnight, then treated with JQ1 (from 0 to
1000 nM) for 24 hours. Cells were lysed with the cold assay
buffer and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 minutes at 4°C.
5 μl supernatant was then mixed with 45 μl reaction buffer.
The absorbance (450 nm) was measured at 0 minutes (T1)
after 30 minutes of incubation at 37°C (T2), using a plate
reader. The relative LDHA activity was determined by (T2–
T1). All results were normalized on the basis of the total
protein concentration of the cells. All the experiments were
performed in triplicate and repeated three times.

Orthotropic xenografts of serous ovarian cancer
The vast majority of epithelial ovarian tumors are of
the serous histologic type (75–80%). The K18-gT121+/–; p53fl/fl;
–Brca1fl/fl (KpB) mouse model is a unique serous ovarian
cancer mouse model that specifically and somatically deletes
the tumor suppressor genes, Brca1 and p53, and inactivates
the retinoblastoma (Rb) proteins in adult ovarian surface
epithelial cells (KpB mouse model) [8]. At 4–6 months,
tumors develop in the affected ovary, while the un-injected
ovary remains normal and can be used as a contralateral
control. Histologic examination and marker studies
demonstrate that the KpB ovarian tumors recapitulate the
major features of serous ovarian cancer. As an extension
of this model, we have established an ovarian tumor cell
line from one of the KpB mice (M909). Upon re-injection
of these tumor cells into the ovarian bursa of female mice,
we have developed a more aggressive variant of the KpB
model. At 10–14 days after injection of these tumor cells, a
tumor can be palpated on the ovary of these mice. At 28–42

days, all of these mice have disseminated disease throughout
the abdomen (unpublished data).
For the evaluation of JQ1’s in vivo effects, M909
cells (1 × 106 cells/5 μl) were injected into left side of
the ovarian bursa of 6–8 week old T121+ p53f/f Brcar1f/f
female mice. All mice were handled according to protocols
approved by UNC-CH Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee (IACUC). Twenty mice were injected with the
M909 cells and then randomly divided into the control,
placebo (saline) group and JQ1 treatment group. The JQ1
treatment (intraperitoneal injection, 50 mg/kg/day) was
initiated twelve days after the injection, and the tumor was
palpated twice a week, when tumor reached certain size
(more than 0.4–0.5 cm), we measured the tumor by calipers
twice a week. Tumor volume was calculated using the
following equation: tumor volume=(width2 × length)/2. All
mice were euthanized after four weeks of JQ1 or placebo
treatment. Tumor tissue and blood samples were collected
for immunohistochemical staining, measurement of LDHA
activity and lactate production assays.

The mouse tumor tissue was formalin-fixed and
paraffin-embedded. Slides (5 μm) were first incubated
with Protein Block solution (Dako) for 1 hour and then
with the primary antibodies for c-Myc (1: 200), LDHA(1:
200), Ki-67(1: 400) and cleaved caspase-3(1: 300) for
2 hours at room temperature. The slides were then washed
and incubated with appropriate secondary antibodies at
room temperature for 1 hour. The slides were washed, and
the specific staining was visualized using the SignalStain
Boost IHC Detection Reagent (Cell Signaling Technology)
following the manufacturer’s instructions. Individual
slides were scanned using the Aperio™ ScanScope
(Aperio Technologies, Vista, CA), and digital images were
analyzed for target protein expression using Aperio™
