Abstract
Reversible epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors are the first class of small molecules to improve progression-free survival of patients with EGFR-mutated lung cancers. Second-generation EGFR
inhibitors introduced to overcome acquired resistance by the T790M resistance mutation of EGFR have thus
far shown limited clinical activity in patients with T790M-mutant tumors. In this study, we systematically
analyzed the determinants of the activity and selectivity of the second-generation EGFR inhibitors. A focused
library of irreversible as well as structurally corresponding reversible EGFR-inhibitors was synthesized for
chemogenomic profiling involving over 79 genetically defined NSCLC and 19 EGFR-dependent cell lines. Overall, our results show that the growth-inhibitory potency of all irreversible inhibitors against the EGFRT790M
resistance mutation was limited by reduced target inhibition, linked to decreased binding velocity to the mutant kinase. Combined treatment of T790M-mutant tumor cells with BIBW-2992 and the phosphoinositide3-kinase/mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor PI-103 led to synergistic induction of apoptosis. Our
findings offer a mechanistic explanation for the limited efficacy of irreversible EGFR inhibitors in EGFRT790M
gatekeeper-mutant tumors, and they prompt combination treatment strategies involving inhibitors that target
signaling downstream of the EGFR. Cancer Res; 70(3): 868–74. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Reversible epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors were the first targeted therapeutics approved for the treatment of non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC; refs. 1, 2). The
4-amino-quinazoline scaffold allows specific binding in the
ATP-binding cleft of mutationally activated ERBB kinases (3).

Based on this scaffold, inhibitors such as gefitinib abrogate
the oncogenic signaling of EGFR (4, 5), promote tumor shrinkage in EGFR-mutated patients, and thus, significantly extend
progression-free survival of patients with late stage lung cancer (2, 6).
One of the greatest challenges for drug development is the
emergence of in cis resistance mutations to tyrosine kinase
inhibitors. For patients with EGFR mutant lung cancer with
acquired drug resistance mutation of the gatekeeper (T790M;
ref. 7), irreversible second-generation EGFR inhibitors (8)
have been introduced but have thus far shown limited clinical efficacy (9, 10). We synthesized and studied the activity of
a library of 19 structurally related ERBB inhibitors in genetically validated cellular models (11, 12).

Materials and Methods
A detailed description of the synthesis of all inhibitors and
applied methods is given in the Supplementary Methods. All
other compounds were purchased from commercial suppliers, dissolved in DMSO, and stored at −80°C. The collection of
84 NSCLC cells was established previously (11). Single nucleotide polymorphism arrays and mutational analyses were
used for routine authentication of the cell lines (11). Ba/F3
cell lines were established and described previously (12)
and tested for the expression of the mutant ERBB construct,
using immunoblotting and Sanger sequencing. Viability

assays were performed measuring cellular ATP content (CellTiter-Glo; Promega). Immunoblotting was performed using
standard procedures (13). For apoptosis assays, cells were
treated with the respective compound for 24 to 96 h, stained
with Annexin V-FITC/PI and analyzed by flow cytometry on
a Canto instrument (BD Biosciences). The modeling of RL58
into EGFR-T790M was performed using PyMol (DeLano Scientific LLC). The structure was modeled by mapping the coordinates onto the erlotinib structure bound to EGFR (PDB
code: 1m17). For covalent bond formation, velocity was measured determining fluorescence in black 384-well plates with
a TECAN Safire2 plate reader over time (excitation, 368 nm;
emission, 420 nm).

Results
To identify the critical moieties of ERBB inhibitors determining potency and specificity, we synthesized (Supplementary
Fig. S1) a library of irreversible 4-amino-quinazolines and quinolines together with their reversible counterparts and characterized their activity in biochemical assays (Fig. 1A). To obtain
compounds with high structural similarity and to facilitate the
interpretation of structure-activity relations of each modification, we varied the inhibitor structures (Fig. 1A).
To determine the activity of these compounds, we used a
NSCLC cell line panel that consists of 18% EGFR- and ERBB2mutated cells (Fig. 1B; ref. 11). We first genetically validated
the dependency on EGFR signaling in EGFR-mutated cells
using lentiviral-mediated gene silencing of EGFR (Supplementary Fig. S2A). We next confirmed the activity of our
synthesized compounds and observed different levels of dephosphorylation of EGFR in the EGFR-dependent PC9 cells
after 8 hours of treatment (Supplementary Fig. S2B).
We next characterized cellular compound activity (Supplementary Table S1) and performed hierarchical clustering for all
screened cell lines (n = 79/84; Fig. 1C). This analysis revealed
clustering of three subgroups of compounds as defined by their
potency and specificity to target EGFR and ERBB2 (Fig. 1C).
The first group exhibited low activity in ERBB-dependent cells
and extended activity in non–ERBB-dependent cells (RL45,
RL13, RL14, and RL7; Fig. 1C). A second group of inhibitors,
showed high activity in EGFR-mutated cell lines and limited
activity in ERBB2-mutated and ERBB-independent cells
(RL20, RL2, RL11, RL6, erlotinib, RL10, RL23, RL58, RL50,
gefitinib, PD168393, and RL3; Fig. 1C). In a third group, high
activity in EGFR- and ERBB2-mutated cell lines was coupled
to limited activity in ERBB-independent cells (lapatinib,
BIBW-2992). Of note, none of the analyzed inhibitors showed
high activity in T790M-EGFR gatekeeper mutant cell lines
(H1975, H820). Thus, our analysis revealed the genotypedependent activity of our ERBB inhibitor library and shows
the limited effect of different electrophilic side chain substitutions on the potency of ERBB inhibitors against tumors
expressing the T790M mutation.
We next screened a collection of Ba/F3 cells (12) expressing known EGFR and ERBB2 mutations with or without
concomitant expression of the T790M mutation. We measured cellular viability (Supplementary Table S2) and per-

www.aacrjournals.org

formed hierarchical clustering of the GI 50 values. We
observed high activity for all inhibitors in cells without a
gatekeeper mutation with superior activity of irreversible inhibitors in the presence of insertion mutations and extracellular domain mutations of EGFR (Fig. 2A; Supplementary
Fig. S3). Mirroring our results obtained in the panel of NSCLC
cell lines, we observed a reduction of the activity of all inhibitors in the background of T790M mutations (Fig. 2A and
B). Of note, the reduction of activity of irreversible inhibitors
varied between the different concomitant mutations expressed with the EGFR gatekeeper T790M mutation in the
Ba/F3 cell lines (Fig. 2A and B; Supplementary Table S2).
Dephosphorylation of the target tyrosine kinase was
achieved at the nanomolar range in cells with single-activating EGFR mutations but not in cells coexpressing the T790M
gatekeeper mutation (Fig. 2C). Thus, our results imply that
although irreversible binding of EGFR inhibitors in gatekeeper-mutated EGFR is more potent than reversible inhibition,
the potency of the inhibitors is dramatically reduced when
compared with single activating EGFR mutations.
We next sought to determine the effect of the T790M mutation in EGFR on the velocity of covalent bond formation of
an irreversible inhibitor in the ATP-binding pocket. For this
purpose, we developed a fluorescent-based assay (Supplementary methods), which exploits the fact that covalent
bond formation of the inhibitor with EGFR-Cys797 leads to
a shift in fluorescence emission of the inhibitor (Fig. 3A). For
PD168393 in EGFRL858R + T790M, we observed a doubling of
covalent bond-formation time (Fig. 3B), thus providing a
mechanistic explanation for the limited ability of the irreversible inhibitors to inhibit the target.
We next validated the dependency on EGFR signaling in
the EGFR L858R + T790M–mutated H1975 cells through lentiviralmediated gene silencing of EGFR (Supplementary Fig. S4).
Based on our biochemical and cellular analyses, we speculated
that the activity of irreversible inhibitors is primarily dictated by the initial reversible binding of the scaffold to the
hinge region—a short flexible sequence of amino acids that
connects the N-lobe and C-lobe of the kinase and forms key
hydrogen bonding interactions with ATP-competitive inhibitors (Fig. 3A). These initial interactions may be critical for
promoting the subsequent reaction of the electrophiles of
such inhibitors with Cys797 of EGFR. Thus, we tested
BIBW-2992, its reversible counterpart RL58, and erlotinib
for their potency to dephosphorylate EGFR in H1975 cells
(Fig. 3C). Confirming our hypothesis, RL58 dephosphorylated
EGFR at concentrations 5-fold lower than erlotinib (Fig. 3C).
Erlotinib and RL58 are similar in that they both contain a
water-solubilizing moiety, although different, at the 7-position
of a quinazoline core. Thus, the superior potency of RL58
might be explained by the 4-(dimethylamino)butanamide
moiety found in the 6- position. The protonated tertiary amine
of this moiety may form a charged interaction with the side
chain of Asp800 located in a helix at the front lip of the ATPbinding pocket of EGFR (Fig. 3D), an additional interaction
not observed for erlotinib.
Overall, our data derived from the covalent bond formation assays suggest that beyond the effect on the affinity

be due to steric hindrance. This hindrance disrupts the initial
reversible binding of these inhibitors in the ATP binding site

and delays covalent bond formation (Fig. 3B). However, this
effect may be partially overcome by the introduction of
additional protein-inhibitor interactions with amino acid
side chains outside of the hinge region. This is highlighted

by the ability of RL58 to retain high potency against
EGFR T790M in both biochemical (Fig. 1A) and cellular
(Fig. 3C) assays when compared with its irreversible counterpart BIBW-2992.
We speculated that inhibiting signaling downstream of
EGFR might compensate for the limited activity of irreversible ERBB inhibitors (Fig. 4A) in T790M-mutated cells at
clinically relevant concentrations. At clinically achievable
doses (0.3 μmol/L), BIBW-2992 does not fully dephosphorylate either EGFR or the downstream signaling (Fig. 4B). Of
note, inhibition of MEK (PD0325901) also leads to the dephosphorylation of EGFR, and dasatinib treatment does not
lead to dephosphorylation of its primary target SRC in this
setting (Fig. 4B). Induction of apoptosis achieved by BIBW2992 alone (Fig. 4C) can be mimicked by dual inhibition
with BIBW-2992 and the phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K)/
mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor PI-103 (Fig. 4D),
although PI-103 alone could induce apoptosis in these cells
(ref. 15; Fig. 4D). Although statistically not significant, this
combination is superior to BIBW-2992 single treatment as
well as dual EGFR/MEK inhibition or dual EGFR/SRC inhibi-

tion at clinically relevant concentrations (Fig. 4B and D). Thus,
our data suggests that erlotinib-resistant lung cancer might be
overcome by combined treatment with irreversible EGFR
inhibitors and PI3K inhibitors.

Discussion
Here, we show that the gatekeeper mutation T790M in
EGFR slows down the covalent bond formation of irreversible
inhibitors, reduces target inhibition, and limits the cytotoxic
activity of such inhibitors in cells expressing the resistance
mutation. Furthermore, our structural analysis of the reversible counterpart of BIBW-2992 provides evidence that the first
step of the non–covalent binding of irreversible inhibitors in
the binding pocket might be responsible for the potency of
such inhibitors. Initial preclinical studies had provided a rationale for irreversible EGFR inhibitors in the setting of T790Mrelated acquired erlotinib resistance (16, 17). However, in virtually all of these cases, cytotoxicity could only be achieved at
clinically unachievable concentrations or combination therapy was required to augment this activity (18). Our systematic

approach is directed towards the T790M mutation in EGFR as
a limiting factor in the efficacy of irreversible inhibitors being
in line with previous reports (19).
In summary, we provide insights into the limited efficacy
of second-generation ERBB inhibitors in erlotinib-resistant
T790M gatekeeper-mutated cells, which might be overcome
through combinatorial inhibition of EGFR and downstream
PI3K signaling with a direct effect on the clinical evaluation
of these drugs.
