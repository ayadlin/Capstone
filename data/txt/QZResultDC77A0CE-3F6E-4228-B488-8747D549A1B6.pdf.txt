BACKGROUND: The treatment of non–acquired immunodeficiency syndrome-defining cancers may be complicated by drug interactions between highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and chemotherapy. This trial is the first by the AIDS Malignancy Consortium to assess targeted therapies and HAART in human immunodeficiency virus-positive patients (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier:
NCT00890747). METHODS: In a modified phase 1 study of sunitinib, patients were stratified into 2 treatment arms based on whether
they were receiving therapy with ritonavir, a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor. Patients in treatment arm 1 (non-ritonavir HAART) received
standard sunitinib dosing (50 mg/day). Treatment arm 2 (ritonavir-based HAART) used a phase 1, 3 1 3 dose escalation design (from
25 mg/day to 50 mg/day). Cycles were comprised of 4 weeks on treatment followed by a 2-week break (6 weeks total). The pharmacokinetics of sunitinib and its active metabolite (N-desethyl sunitinib) were assessed. RESULTS: Nineteen patients were enrolled and
were evaluable. Patients on treatment arm 1 tolerated treatment with no dose-limiting toxicity observed. In treatment arm 2, a doselimiting toxicity was experienced at a dose of 37.5 mg, and an additional 3 of 5 patients experienced grade 3 neutropenia (toxicity
graded as per National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [version 4.0]), an uncommon toxicity of
sunitinib. No patient achieved a response, but 10 patients had stable disease, including 8 with prolonged disease stability. Efavirenz, a
potent inducer of CYP3A4, resulted in increased exposure of N-desethyl sunitinib, whereas ritonavir caused decreased exposure of
the metabolite. Hand-foot syndrome was associated with higher steady-state trough concentrations of sunitinib. CONCLUSIONS:
Patients receiving non–ritonavir-based HAART regimens tolerated standard dosing of sunitinib. Patients receiving ritonavir-based
therapy who were treated with a dose of 37.5 mg/day experienced higher toxicities. Dose reductions of sunitinib to 37.5 mg may be

Phase 1 Study of Sunitinib and HAART/Rudek et al

of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and
AIDS-defining illnesses, including opportunistic infections as well as AIDS-defining malignancies, have been on
the decline since HAART therapy became widely prescribed in the mid- to late 1990s.1
Although the incidences of AIDS-defining malignancies such as non-Hodgkin lymphoma and Kaposi sarcoma have dramatically decreased over the last 20 years,
the prevalence of non–AIDS-defining cancers (NADCs)
has been on the rise.3 Epidemiology studies regarding the
rates of cancers in the pre-HAART and post-HAART eras
in patients residing in the United States, France, and Switzerland have shown increases in the incidence ratios in
specific cancers, such as those of the head and neck, lung,
liver, anus, and kidney, as well as Hodgkin disease.3-7
Viral coinfections may in part explain the higher rates of
some of these cancers such as Hodgkin lymphoma, liver
cancer, and anal cancer. However, for many of these diseases, the higher incidence rates among HIV-positive
patients are not explained by viral coinfections or other
risk factors.8 For example, the increased incidence of head
and neck and lung cancers is not completely explained by
a higher use of tobacco products among patients diagnosed with HIV.3,9
HAART typically includes a 3-drug to 4-drug combination of protease inhibitors (PIs), nucleotide reverse
transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), nonnucleoside reverse
transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), and/or additional
agents.10,11 A significant amount of research over the past
decade has investigated how these HAART drugs are
metabolized, including how these agents both induce and
inhibit various enzymes involved in drug metabolism.12
For example, to various degrees, all PIs inhibit CYP3A4,
an enzyme that mediates the metabolism of greater than
one-half of all drugs that undergo hepatic metabolism.
Ritonavir is a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4, and this fact
has been used to increase the drug delivery of other
HAART agents via “boosted” combination therapy.13
The question of how to treat cancer in patients
receiving HAART with chemotherapy for a NADC is
complicated, and to the best of our knowledge not well
studied. In fact, an HIV diagnosis is often an exclusionary
criterion in clinical trials of NADCs due to concerns
regarding potential drug-drug interactions and a higher
perceived risk of immune-medicated complications. In
2009, the National Cancer Institute-sponsored AIDS
Malignancy Consortium began the first in a planned series of clinical trials to better understand the use, dosing,
and toxicities of targeted chemotherapies when combined
with HAART to better understand such potential interacCancer

tions, and to provide treatment recommendations when
using such agents.
Sunitinib malate is an orally available, multitargeted,
tyrosine kinase inhibitor approved for the treatment of renal cell carcinoma and gastrointestinal stromal tumors, as
well as pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, and has been
assessed in a wide range of other solid tumor malignancies
in clinical trials. The drug inhibits platelet-derived growth
factor receptor, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1 and 3, KIT, FMS-like tyrosine kinase-3 (FLT3), the
receptor stem cell factor, and RET.14-18 Sunitinib is
metabolized by CYP3A4 to produce the primary active
metabolite N-desethyl sunitinib via N-deethylation.
Given the potential interactions between HAART agents
and sunitinib at the level of CYP3A4, which could lead to
reduced efficacy and/or increased toxicity, we conducted
the current phase 1 study.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients

Patients who were HIV positive and had a diagnosis of a
solid or hematologic malignancy were eligible if they had
developed disease progression after standard therapy
and/or other curative options were not available. Patients
were required to have a cluster of differentiation 4
(CD4)-positive (CD1) T lymphocyte count of 50
cells/lL and be on stable HAART for at least 4 weeks
with a PI-based or NNRTI-based regimen of at least 3
drugs. Eligibility criteria included adequate bone marrow, liver, and renal function; a Karnofsky performance
status of at least 60%; no opportunistic infection or
uncontrolled medical condition; the ability to take oral
medication; and a life expectancy of >3 months. Patients
provided written informed consent as per federal and
institutional guidelines before treatment.
Given the potential for cardiac toxicity from sunitinib, patients were ineligible if they had clinically significant cardiovascular disease, including uncontrolled
hypertension, unstable angina, cardiac arrhythmia, an
abnormal left ventricular ejection fraction, a myocardial
infarction, or another significant vascular disease-related
event within the previous 6 months. Patients could not be
taking medications that were known to inhibit or induce
CYP3A4 other than antiretroviral drugs used to treat HIV
infection, and were asked to avoid grapefruit and star fruit
juice. Medications known to have a proarrhythmic potential were also not allowed. Chemoprophylaxis for Pneumocystis jirovecii (PCP) pneumonia was required for
patients with a CD41 count of <200 cells/lL.

Original Article

Erythropoietin and granulocyte–colony-stimulating factors were allowed if clinically indicated but only after the
completion of cycle 1 of treatment. Palliative radiotherapy
to specific sites of disease was permitted after cycle 1 if
considered to be medically necessary by the treating physician and the involved field was not considered to represent
disease progression.
Study Design

This phase 1 trial was conducted to determine the safety
of and to investigate the pharmacological interactions of
administering sunitinib to HIV-positive patients with
cancer who were receiving antiretroviral regimens containing PIs and/or NNRTIs. Secondary objectives
included evaluating the efficacy of sunitinib in treating
NADCs in these patients, and to detect alterations in
immune parameters, including total leukocyte count,
CD41 lymphocyte count, and HIV viral load during
sunitinib therapy. The original trial design stratified
patients into 1 of 3 groups based on the type of HAART
therapy they were receiving: 1) NNRTI-based therapy; 2)
non–ritonavir PI-based therapy; and 3) ritonavir PI-based
therapy. In December 2009, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended against treating newly
diagnosed HIV-positive patients with non–ritonavircontaining PI-based therapies, and thus that treatment
arm was closed.
Patients receiving NNRTI-based therapy received
the standard sunitinib dose of 50 mg/day for 4 weeks, followed by a 2-week treatment break (6-week cycles). For
patients receiving ritonavir, the sunitinib dose level was
escalated from 25 mg/day in 12.5-mg/day increments up
to the standard dose (50 mg/day) using a 3 1 3 phase 1
design. A total of 6 patients would be treated at the maximum tolerated dose level. Patients were allowed to stay on
therapy as long as they experienced clinical benefit and
tolerable toxicities.
The protocol was approved by each site’s Institutional Review Board. Data and safety monitoring, including dose escalation decisions, was overseen by an
independent medical monitor.
Toxicity and Response

Toxicities were assessed using the National Cancer Institute’s Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events
(version 4.0). A dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) was defined
as an adverse event occurring during cycle 1 with a possible, probable, or definite relation to the study medication
and fulfilled 1 of the following criteria: grade 4 neutropenia lasting 7 days; febrile neutropenia; neutropenic
1196

infection (grade 3 or 4); grade 4 thrombocytopenia lasting
for 7 days; any grade 3 or 4 nonhematologic toxicity
lasting 7 days (except alopecia and grade 3 asymptomatic hypertension with adequately controlled blood pressure with medication); grade 3 or 4 nausea, vomiting, or
diarrhea lasting for 24 hours despite maximal medical
therapy; and any toxicity that precluded initiating cycle 2
within 14 days of the protocol-specified date. Dose reductions were allowed for toxicities not meeting the definition of a DLT but only after cycle 1.
Patients were assessed for response after every 2
cycles (12 weeks) of therapy, using the same modality (eg,
computed tomography scans, magnetic resonance imaging) by which the measurable disease was initially evaluated. Response was assessed using criteria depending on
the subject’s primary disease, as follows: for solid tumors,
the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
(RECIST)19 were used; for prostate cancer, Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Working group Response Criteria from
the National Cancer Institute Prostate Specific Antigen
Working Group20 were used; for Kaposi sarcoma, AIDS
Clinical Trials Group criteria21 were used; for lymphoma,
the International Working Group Response Criteria for
Malignant Lymphomas22 were used; for multiple myeloma, International Myeloma Working Group Uniform
Response Criteria23 were used; and for leukemia, the
International Working Group for Diagnosis, Standardization of Response Criteria, Treatment Outcomes, and
Reporting Standards for Acute Leaukemias were used.24
Pharmacokinetic Sampling, Assay, and Analysis

Serial blood samples for pharmacokinetic analysis were
collected during cycle 1 on day 1, in addition to weekly
trough samples through day 29, with an optional half-life
assessment to day 42. Total and unbound plasma concentrations of sunitinib and N-desethyl sunitinib were determined using a validated liquid chromatography-tandem
mass spectrometry method.25 Individual pharmacokinetic
parameters were estimated by standard noncompartmental analysis using WinNonlin Professional software (version 5.3; Pharsight Corporation, Mountain View, Calif).
The following pharmacokinetic parameters were estimated: area under the plasma concentration-time curve
from time 0 to 24 hours on day 1 (AUC0-24 hours), peak
plasma concentration (Cmax), minimal plasma concentrations at steady-state (Cmin,ss), half-life (T1/2), average fraction unbound (Fu), and the relative systemic exposure to
sunitinib for the metabolite N-desethyl sunitinib. Cmin,ss
was calculated from day 15 to day 29 and from day 22 to
day 29, respectively, for sunitinib and N-desethyl

sunitinib based on the time to steady-state estimated
based on the reported half-life and dosing interval.26
Dose-normalized Cmax, Cmin,ss, and AUC0-24 hours values
were calculated as the observed parameter divided by the
actual dose.
Statistical Analysis

The primary objective of the current study was to investigate the safety and pharmacological interactions of
administering sunitinib to patients with cancer who were
receiving HAART therapy. No formal statistical hypothesis testing was planned for the primary analysis of the
safety parameters due to the small sample size; instead,
results have been presented descriptively. Pharmacokinetic parameters were summarized using descriptive statistics. Differences in dose-normalized pharmacokinetic
parameters across groups were evaluated using a 2-sided
Kruskal-Wallis test. Mann-Whitney U tests were used to
assess correlations between sunitinib and metabolite exposure and toxicity. The a priori level of significance was set
at P < .05.

RESULTS
Patients

Between August 2009 and April 2011, a total of 21
patients were enrolled, 19 of whom completed cycle 1 of
therapy and were evaluable for toxicities. One enrolled
patient did not initiate treatment, and another patient
came off the study as per patient preference (not for toxicity) before completing cycle 1. Demographic data regarding the 19 evaluable patients are summarized in Table 1.
The 1 patient enrolled to the non-ritonavir PI arm was
included for purposes of analysis in treatment arm 1
(NNRTI-based therapy) after that arm was closed. After 6
patients were enrolled to the NNRTI arm, the protocol
was amended to allow another 3 patients (for a total of 6
patients) who were receiving efavirenz, a known inducer
of CYP3A4, due to an interim pharmacokinetic assessment indicating a significant increase in N-desethyl sunitinib formation. Enrollment by treatment arm and dose
level are presented in Table 2.
Treatment and Toxicities

Treatment in the NNRTI arm was well tolerated, and no
DLTs were observed. On the ritonavir treatment arm, 4
patients were treated at the 25-mg dose level and 3
patients completed cycle 1 without any significant toxicities. One patient with non-small cell lung cancer experienced rapid tumor progression and was taken off the
study for clinical disease progression. At the 37.5-mg dose

wound complications), and the cohort was expanded to 6
patients. None of the remaining 5 patients experienced a
protocol-defined DLT, although 3 patients experienced
grade 3 neutropenia. Given this safety profile, further
expansion to a 50-mg dose was not recommended by the
independent medical monitor. The maximum tolerated
dose for patients receiving ritonavir was thus determined
to be 37.5 mg.

Toxicities had a possible, probable, or definite relation to study treatment and were graded as per National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for

in Table 3. The most common toxicities observed in addition to hematological abnormalities were diarrhea, fatigue, nausea/vomiting, hand-foot syndrome, and
hypertension. One patient was treated with local palliative
radiotherapy for pain control while on the study, which
was not deemed by the treating investigator to represent
disease progression, nor did it account for any additional
treatment-related toxicities.

Kaposi sarcoma, whereas 1 patient each had a diagnosis of
melanoma, sarcoma, renal cell carcinoma, salivary gland
carcinoma, and adenocystic carcinoma of the lung. The
patient with salivary gland cancer (adenocarcinoma histology) had been heavily pretreated, and was on the study for
14 cycles (20 months). Of the 8 patients who achieved stable disease on prolonged therapy, 4 had their dose of sunitinib reduced after cycle 1, including 3 patients on the
NNRTI treatment arm.

Response

A total of 17 patients were evaluable for response. No
patient experienced an objective response to therapy. A
total of 10 patients (56%) experienced stable disease as
their best response, including 8 patients (44%) who experienced prolonged stable disease lasting at least 4 cycles
(24 weeks). Three of these patients were diagnosed with

Effect of Sunitinib on HIV Disease Parameters

No significant effect of treatment with sunitinib on
CD41 cell count and HIV viral load parameters was
observed, arguing against any sunitinib-induced effect of
the pharmacology of HAART. The median change in the
log CD4 count from baseline to the end of cycle 2 was

20.02 (range, 20.23 to 0.25; 13 patients) and was
20.03 (range, 20.14 to 0.10; 8 patients) after cycle 4.
For those patients with detectable levels, the median
change in the log HIV viral load from baseline to the end
of cycle 2 was 20.18 (range, 22.78 to 0.0; 6 patients)
and was 20.33 (range, 22.05 to 0.0; 4 patients) after
cycle 4.
Pharmacokinetics

Pharmacokinetic analysis was performed among 18
patients (Table 4). One patient was excluded due to the
pretreatment sample containing significant sunitinib concentrations. Consistent with previous reports, pharmacokinetic analysis demonstrated significant interpatient
variability with regard to sunitinib and its active metabolite,
N-desethyl sunitinib.26,27 Despite trends toward increased
sunitinib exposure with ritonavir (AUC0-24 hours: P 5 .16;
Cmax: P 5 .08; and Cmin,ss: P 5 .07), there were no statistically significant alterations in sunitinib pharmacokinetics
noted between the treatment arms. However, there were
significant alterations in N-desethyl sunitinib exposure.
Efavirenz resulted in a 410% increase compared with
NNRTI, whereas ritonavir caused a 48% decrease in the
Cmax for N-desethyl sunitinib (P 5 .0008; efavirenz > ritonavir). A similar trend was noted with a 390%
increase in the AUC0-24 hours for N-desethyl sunitinib in
the efavirenz arm compared with the NNRTI arm, with a
40% decrease observed in the ritonavir treatment arm
(P 5 .006; efavirenz > ritonavir and NNRTI). At steadystate trough concentrations, the inhibitory effect of ritonavir on metabolite formation was not observed (12%
increase) but efavirenz still resulted in a 234% increase in
the Cmin,ss for N-desethyl sunitinib compared with
NNRTI (P 5 .06 for N-desethyl sunitinib and P 5 .07 for
sunitinib). The differences in N-desethyl sunitinib concentrations were significant enough to alter the ratio of
metabolite-to-parent drug (P 5 .01 for AUC0-24 hours and
Cmin,ss; efavirenz > ritonavir and NNRTI) but not the sum
total AUC0-24 hours when assessed on a dose-normalized basis (P 5 .68). There was no alteration in protein binding
noted across study arms (P > .05). There was a correlation
between hand-foot syndrome and elevated sunitinib Cmin,ss
observed (P 5 .013) but not sunitinib exposure after a single dose (P > .05) nor with N-desethyl sunitinib exposure
(P > .05). No significant correlation was noted between
any pharmacokinetic parameter and grade 3 neutropenia.
DISCUSSION
Since HAART became widely prescribed beginning in
1996, there has been a dramatic change in the course of

the AIDS epidemic.1,2 Patients with AIDS are no longer
faced with an invariably terminal illness, but rather a
chronic condition with an improved life span.1,2 As the
use of HAART became more widespread in developed
countries, the incidence of AIDS-defining cancers also
declined.3 Unfortunately, patients with HIV are now
being diagnosed at high rates with NADCs.3-7 As new targeted therapies have become available to treat these cancers, how best to use, and dose, these chemotherapy
agents to treat HIV-positive patients with NADCs who
are receiving HAART remains an important research and
clinical question.
Given concerns regarding drug-drug interactions,
one potential strategy might be to withdraw HAART
therapy while treating a malignancy. However, taking
patients off HAART therapy, including the use of
“structured treatment interruptions” (which it was hoped
would reduce drug resistance and improve the tolerability
of HAART therapy), can lead to poorer outcomes, including higher rates of drug resistance and an increased risk of
death from any cause.10,28
In this modified phase 1 trial, we found that patients
receiving non–ritonavir-containing HAART therapy tolerated standard dosing of sunitinib at 50 mg/day using
the 4-week-on/2-week-off schedule. However, patients
receiving ritonavir-based therapy experienced toxicity at
the 37.5-mg/day dose level that was comparable to or
higher than that noted in patients receiving the nonritonavir 50-mg/day dose level, including higher rates of
grade 3 neutropenia and grade 1/2 diarrhea, mucositis,
and fatigue. Due to this toxicity profile, the recommended
dose for patients receiving ritonavir is 37.5 mg/day on the
4-week-on/2-week-off schedule.
Two previous clinical studies were conducted in
healthy volunteers to investigate drug-drug interactions
with sunitinib based on the potential effect of inhibition
and induction of the CYP3A4 metabolic pathway, and are
reported in the US Food and Drug Administrationapproved package insert of Sutent (sunitinib malate;
Pfizer, New York, NY).29 Exposure was found to be
altered significantly by ketoconazole and rifampin with
recommendations to consider a starting dose of 37.5 mg
when administered with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor or
increasing the dose in 12.5-mg increments to a maximum
of 87.5 mg when administered with a strong CYP3A4 inducer. The results of the current study confirm these findings and, in the case of the potent CYP3A4 inhibitor
ritonavir, are in keeping with the dose modification recommended in the package insert. The dose escalation in
the efavirenz treatment arm was not explored due to

Phase 1 Study of Sunitinib and HAART/Rudek et al

concerns with the nontraditional toxicities being observed
in our patient population. These findings also highlight
the variability of exposure with CYP3A4 inhibitors/
inducers of different strengths, and the need for further
studies to guide the magnitude of adjustments needed in
dosing drugs that may alter metabolism through this
pathway.
Rates of grade 3 or 4 neutropenia in phase 3 trials of
sunitinib in the treatment of renal cell carcinoma, gastrointestinal stromal tumors, and primitive neuroectodermal
tumors using the dose of 50 mg/day were 17%, 10%, and
16%, respectively, according to the Sutent package
insert.29 The 60% rate observed on the ritonavir treatment arm at the dose of 37.5 mg/day (administered to 3
of 5 patients who completed cycle 1 of treatment) was
unexpected, and proved to be the dose limiting toxicity
for such patients. These were patients on a phase 1 trial
who had received prior systemic cytotoxic chemotherapy
(median, 1.7 regimens; range, 0 regimens-4 regimens).
This may account in part for the higher rate of neutropenia observed. A contributing factor may be that sunitinib
and N-desethyl sunitinib are substrates for the ABCB1
and ABCG2 drug transporters.30,31 PIs, including ritonavir, have been found to inhibit ABCB1.32 ABCB1 expression and function are important in myeloid stem cells.33
Therefore, this high rate of neutropenia may be due to
ritonavir inhibition of ABCB1-mediated sunitinib efflux
in myeloid stem cells, resulting in the accumulation of
even higher concentrations in such cells and in turn inducing this hematologic toxicity. There was no correlation
between neutropenia and systemic exposure to sunitinib
or N-desethyl sunitinib noted.
This first trial of the AIDS Malignancy Consortium,
which was conducted to better understand the use of targeted therapies in HIV-positive patients, suggests
HAART-based dosing recommendations that can now be
used in other clinical trials and by practicing medical
oncologists. Given the increasing rates of non–AIDSdefining solid tumors and hematological malignancies, we
hope that this and future studies will result in improved
treatment information to guide the use of targeted anticancer agents in the care of HIV-positive patients.
