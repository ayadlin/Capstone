Abstract
We investigated the genotype-dependent therapeutic potential
of targeting the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway for thyroid cancer. Proliferation of TPC1, Hth7, FTC133,
OCUT1, K1, and BCPAP cells that harbored PI3K/Aktactivating genetic alterations was potently inhibited by the
Akt inhibitor perifosine, whereas SW1736, Hth74, WRO,
KAT18, and TAD2 cells that harbored no genetic alterations
had no or only modest responses. Inhibition of Akt phosphorylation by perifosine was seen in these cells. Geneticdependent apoptosis was induced by perifosine in cells
selectively tested. Similarly, potent inhibition of cell proliferation by the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)
inhibitor temsirolimus occurred in virtually all the cells
harboring genetic alterations, whereas modest inhibition
was seen in some of the cells not harboring genetic
alterations. Temsirolimus inhibited the phosphorylation of
p70S6K, a substrate of mTOR. Knockdown of Akt1/2 or mTOR
by shRNA approach inhibited the proliferation and colony
formation of FTC133 and OCUT1 cells that harbored genetic
alterations in the PI3K/Akt pathway but had no effect on
SW1736 and KAT18 cells that did not. Transfection with
PIK3CA mutants greatly sensitized SW1736 cells to perifosine
and temsirolimus. Growth of xenograft tumors derived from
FTC133 cells but not SW1736 cells in nude mice was
dramatically inhibited by perifosine. Thus, this work for the
first time shows that genetic alterations in the PI3K/Akt
pathway confer thyroid cancer cells addiction to this pathway
and their sensitivity to inhibition by targeting Akt and mTOR.
This genotype-based targeting of the PI3K/Akt pathway using
Akt and mTOR inhibitors may offer an effective therapeutic
strategy for thyroid cancer and warrants further studies.

Introduction
The phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling pathway
plays a fundamental role in cell growth, proliferation and survival
and, when altered, tumorigenesis (1–3). In this signaling, the p110
catalytic subunits of class I PI3Ks, particularly PIK3CA, phosphor-

ylate membrane phosphatidylinositols to produce PI(3,4,5)P3,
which in turn binds and recruits the serine/threonine kinase Akt
to cell membrane for activation by phosphoinositide-dependent
protein kinases, particularly PDK1. A novel Akt inhibitor,
perifosine, can selectively prevent the recruitment of the Akt
pleckstrin homology domain to the membrane and blocks
activation of the downstream signaling (4, 5). The PI3K/Akt
signaling can also be activated by RET/PTC or Ras. Activated Akt is
translocated to the nucleus where it phosphorylates a multitude of
downstream targets, leading to changes in cellular functions. An
important down-stream target of Akt is mammalian target of
rapamycin (mTOR), which plays a critical role in mediating the
proliferative function of the PI3K/Akt pathway (6). This signaling
can be inhibited by specific mTOR inhibitors, such as temsirolimus
(CCI-779) that is highly clinically applicable for its improved water
solubility and stability compared with rapamycin (7). The signaling
of the PI3K/Akt pathway is naturally antagonized by the tumor
suppressor gene PTEN product, PTEN, which is a phosphatase that
terminates the signaling of this pathway by dephosphorylating
PI(3,4,5)P3 (8).
Driven by genetic alterations, the PI3K/Akt pathway is frequently
overactivated in human cancers, including thyroid cancer (1, 9, 10).
Follicular thyroid cell–derived thyroid cancer is the most common
endocrine malignancy. This cancer is classified into differentiated
papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) and follicular thyroid cancer (FTC)
and the undifferentiated anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC; ref. 11).
PTC and FTC may progress into poorly differentiated thyroid
cancer (PDTC). Genetic alterations in the PI3K/Akt pathway are
common in thyroid cancer, including the PIK3CA amplification and
mutations, Ras mutations, PTEN mutations, and amplifications of
some key genes in this pathway (12–18). These genetic alterations
are particularly common and important in aggressive thyroid
cancers, such as PDTC and ATC (13, 14, 17, 18), which account for
most of the incurable and fetal cases of thyroid cancer. Therefore,
the PI3K/Akt pathway is a potentially important and effective
therapeutic target in thyroid cancer. We propose that the activating
genetic alterations in the PI3K/Akt pathway may confer special
sensitivity of thyroid cancer cells to inhibition by targeting the
pathway, which may form a basis for the development of novel
genetic-based therapeutic strategies for this cancer. In the present
study, we tested this hypothesis using two clinically applicable
inhibitors, perifosine and temsirolimus, as well as the shRNA
approach in a large panel of thyroid cancer cell lines for which we
characterized the genotypes of the PI3K/Akt pathway.

Materials and Methods
Thyroid cancer cell lines. The thyroid cancer cell lines C643, Hth7,
Hth74, and SW1736 were originally from Dr. N.E. Heldin (University of
Uppsala, Uppsala, Sweden); KAT18 was from Dr. Kenneth B. Ain (University

Onoda (Osaka City University Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan);
BCPAP was from Dr. Massimo Santoro (University of Federico II, Naples,
Italy); K1 was from Dr. David Wynford-Thomas (University of Wales College
of Medicine, Cardiff, United Kingdom); WRO-82-1 was from Dr. G. J. F.
Juillard (University of California-Los Angeles School of Medicine, Los
Angeles, CA); and FTC133 was from Dr. Georg Brabant (University of
Manchester, Manchester, United Kingdom). The normal thyroid cell–
derived cell line TAD2 was from Dr. Mario Vitale (Università Federico II,
Naples, Italy). The TPC1 cell line was provided by Dr. Alan P. Dackiw (Johns
Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland). These cancer cells have been
recently characterized to be distinct thyroid cancer cell lines (19). They were
all grown at 37jC in RPMI 1640 with 10% fetal bovine serum, except for
FTC133 that was cultured with DMEM/HAM’S F-12 medium. For some
experiments, cells were treated with perifosine or temsirolimus with the
indicated concentrations and time, and the medium and agents were
replenished every 24 h. Perifosine and temsirolimus were obtained from
Cayman Chemical, dissolved in DMSO and ethanol, respectively, with a
stock concentration of 10 mmol/L, and stored at 20jC.
Analysis of genetic alterations in the PI3K/Akt pathway in thyroid
cancer cell lines. We analyzed the major genetic alterations in the PI3K/
Akt pathway in all the thyroid cancer cell lines in the present study. K-Ras
(exons 1 and 2), N-Ras (exons 1 and 2), H-Ras (exons 1 and 2), PIK3CA (exons
9 and 20), and PTEN (exons 5–7) were analyzed for mutations using our
previously designed primers (14, 18). For genomic DNA amplification of all
the genes by PCR, after 4 min of initial denaturing at 95jC, the reaction
mixture was run for 35 cycles at 94jC, 54jC, and 72jC, each for 30 s for
denaturing, annealing, and elongation, respectively, followed by an
elongation at 72jC for 7 min. Copy number of five genes involved in this
pathway, including PIK3CA, PIK3CB, PDK1, Akt-1, and Akt-2, which could be
functionally important if amplified, was analyzed using the primers and
quantitative real-time PCR conditions described previously (18).
Western blotting analysis. Cells were lysed in the radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer. Cellular proteins were resolved on denaturing
polyacrylamide gels, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes
(Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and blotted with appropriate primary
antibodies. Anti–phospho-Akt (Sc-7985-R) and Anti–phospho-p70 S6 Kinase
(p70S6K; Sc-7985-R), and anti-actin (Sc-1616-R) were purchased from Santa
Cruz. Anti–Akt-1 (#2967), anti–Akt-2 (#2964), and anti-mTOR (#2972) were
purchased from Cell Signaling Technologies, Inc. Antibody against V5-tag
(#37–7500) was from Invitrogen. This was followed by incubation with
horseradish peroxidase–conjugated anti-rabbit (Sc-2004) or anti-mouse (Sc2005) IgG antibodies from Santa Cruz, and antigen-antibody complexes
were visualized using the chemilucent enhanced chemiluminescence
detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech).
Lentiviral vector, shRNA plasmid construction, and cell infection
with lentivirus. The lentiviral vector pSicoR-PGK-puro (Addgene, Inc.),
originally constructed as describe (20), was used to express the hairpin RNA
specifically against Akt 1/2 (Akt-1 and Akt-2) or mTOR. The oligonucleotide
sequences cloned into the vector were as follows. Oligonucleotides

(American Type Culture Collection) were cotransfected with the lentiviral
vector and compatible packaging plasmid mixture using Lipofectamine
2000 (Invitrogen), and the supernatant containing lentivirus was collected
48 h after transfection. For virus infection, cells were exposed to lentiviruscontaining supernatant for 24 h in the presence of Polybrene (Sigma). After
selection with puromycin for 1 to 2 wk, stable cell pools were used for cell
proliferation and colony formation studies.

Cell proliferation assay. Cells (800/well) were seeded into 96-well plates
and cultured under various indicated conditions. MTT assay was performed
daily over a 5-d time course to evaluate cell proliferation. After 5 d of
treatments as indicated, cell culture was added with 10 AL of 5 mg/mL MTT
agent (Sigma) and incubated for 4 h, followed by addition of 100 AL of 10%
SDS solution and a further incubation overnight. The plates were then read
on a microplate reader using the test wavelength of 570 nm and the
reference wavelength of 670 nm. Three duplicates were done to determine
each data point. IC50 values were calculated using the Reed-Muench
method (21).
Morphologic assay for apoptosis. For morphologic examination of
apoptotic changes, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min,
and then stained with 5 Ag/mL Hoechst 33342 for 20 min. After PBS
washing, the stained cells were observed under a fluorescence microscope.
For quantitation of the number of apoptotic cells, 500 cells were counted
under microscope as described in (22), and cells with chromatin
condensation, margination or nuclear fragmentation were regarded as
apoptotic cells, which are the characteristic morphology of apoptotic
nuclear (23).
Colony formation assay. For soft-agar colony-formation assay, 2  103
cells ( for FTC133) or 5  103 ( for KAT18) were plated into 12-well plates
with a bottom layer of 0.6% agar and a top layer of 0.3% agar. Following the
hardening of soft agar, plates were incubated at 37jC with 5% CO2. After 2
to 3 wk of culture, colonies were counted and photographed under a
microscope. All the experiments in this study were similarly performed two
to four times.
Xenograft tumor assay in nude mice. FTC133 (2  106) or SW1736

(8 106) cells were injected s.c. into flanks of nude mice at the age of 4 wk
(Harlan Sprague-Dawley). When tumors grew to f5 mm in diameter,
animals were grouped into two groups ( four mice per group) that have
similar average tumor size. The two groups were treated daily with the
vehicle PBS or 25 mg/kg Perifosine through i.p. injection. Mice were
weighed and tumor volume measured at the start of the treatment and
twice a week during the course of the therapy. Tumor volumes were
calculated by the formula (width)2  length/2 as described previously (24).
After treatment for 2 wk, tumors were harvested and weighed. The twotailed Independent-sample t test was used for statistical analysis of
differences in tumor volumes and weights between groups.

Results
Characterization of genetic alterations in the PI3K/Akt
pathway in thyroid cancer cell lines. We analyzed the genetic
alterations in the major components of PI3K/Akt pathway in the
thyroid cancer cell lines used in this study. As summarized in
Table 1, TPC1, C643, and Hth7 cells harbored RET/PTC1
rearrangement, H-Ras mutation, and N-Ras mutation, respectively.
OCUT1 and K1 harbored PI3KCA mutations. It was previously
shown that the FTC133 had one PTEN allele deleted and the
remaining allele harbored a splice variant IVS4-19G->A (25). Here,
we also found that this cell line harbored a mutation in the
remaining allele of PTEN that led to the formation of a premature
stop codon in exon 5. Copy number analysis of the PIK3CA, PIK3CB,
PDK1, Akt-1, and Akt-2 genes showed only Akt-1 copy gain in Hth7
and BCPAP cells. The remaining five cell lines, SW1736, KAT18,
Hth74, WRO, and TAD2, did not harbor any of these genetic
alterations in the present study. These results on genetic
alterations in thyroid cancer cell lines are consistent with our
and other’s previous findings in tumor tissues that these are the
major genetic alterations in the PI3K/Akt pathway in thyroid
cancer (12–18). These cell lines constituted a valuable cell model
for testing the genetic-dependent inhibition of thyroid cancer cells
in the subsequent experiments of this study.

concentration response and time course of the effects of perifosine
on PI3K/Akt signaling in FTC133 cells in which PTEN is deficient.
As shown in Fig. 1A, inhibition of Akt phosphorylation was
remarkable at 0.2 Amol/L and nearly complete at 1 Amol/L.
Complete inhibition was observed at 6 h with perifosine at 5 Amol/L
and the inhibitory effect remained for at least 24 h (Fig. 1A). We also
tested the effect of the Akt inhibitor on other cell lines.
As shown in Fig. 1B, at 5 Amol/L, perifosine remarkably inhibited
Akt phosphorylation in the seven thyroid cancer cell lines that
harbored genetic alternations in the PI3K/Akt pathway, including
TPC1, C643, Hth7, FTC133 (again), OCUT1, K1, and BCPAP cells,

suggesting that the basal activities of the PI3K/Akt signaling was
highly dependent on the genetic alterations in these cells. Perifosine
had varying inhibitory effects on Akt phosphorylation in the
remaining five cell lines, SW1736, KAT18, Hth74, WRO, and TAD2
cells, which did not harbor these genetic alterations, suggesting that
the dependence of the PI3K/Akt signaling on such genetic
alterations in these cells might not be as high.
We next examined the effect of perifosine on the proliferation of
these cell lines. As shown in Fig. 2A, we found that perifosine
significantly inhibited proliferation of TPC1, C643, Hth7, FTC133,
OCUT1, K1, and BCPAP cells in a concentration-dependent

manner, with IC50 values ranging from 1.71 to 10.71 Amol/L (Table 1).
These seven cell lines all harbored genetic alternations in the PI3K/
Akt pathway (Table 1). The PTEN-deficient cell FTC133 was the
most sensitive to perifosine among the seven cell lines, suggesting
that homozygous inactivation of the PTEN gene probably had the
most profound activating effect on the PI3K/Akt pathway. In
contrast, SW1736, KAT18, Hth74, and WRO cells that did not
harbor genetic alternations in the PI3K/Akt pathway were not as
sensitive to perifosine (Fig. 2A); the IC50 value was 35.49 Amol/L for
the SW1736 cell and >1,000 Amol/L for KAT18, and Hth74, and
WRO cells (Table 1). As expected, the normal thyroid cell–derived
TAD2 cell line that lacked PI3K/Akt pathway–associated genetic
alterations did not respond well to perifosine (Table 1; Fig. 2A).
Genetic-selective inhibition of thyroid cancer cell proliferation by the mTOR inhibitor temsirolimus. To further explore
the important role of genetic alterations in drug sensitivity in the
therapeutic targeting of the PI3K/Akt pathway in thyroid cancer
cells, we examined the effect of the mTOR inhibitor, temsirolimus,
on the proliferation of the 12 thyroid cell lines. The inhibitory
effects of temsirolimus on the phosphorylation of p70S6K, a
substrate of mTOR that is involved in protein synthesis and cell
cycle control (26), were also concentration and time dependent
(Fig. 1A). At 5 nmol/L, temsirolimus remarkably suppressed
p70S6K phosphorylation in the 12 cell lines (Fig. 1B).
We next examined the inhibitory effects of temsirolimus on the
proliferation of the 12 cell lines, which, as illustrated in Fig. 2B,
showed a generally similar inhibitory pattern as perifosine did with
few exceptions. Specifically, except for BCPAP cell that showed a
modest sensitivity, all the other six cells that harbored genetic
alterations in the PI3K/Akt pathway were potently sensitive to the
inhibition by temsirolimus, with IC50 values ranging from 0.01 to
7.33 nmol/L (Table 1). The lower sensitivity of BCPAP cells to
temsirolimus may suggest a weak strength of Akt amplification in
this cell in activating the mTOR signaling. Among the cells that did
not harbor genetic alterations, except for WRO cell, a resistance or
much lower sensitivity to temsirolimus was observed, with IC50
values ranging from 18.9 to 1,965.99 nmol/L (Table 1; Fig. 2B). As
with perifosine, the PTEN-deficient cell line FTC133 was again the
most sensitive to temsirolimus (Table 1; Fig. 2B).
Genetic-selective inhibition of cell proliferation by siRNA
targeting the PI3K/Akt pathway. To confirm the genetic
dependency of inhibition of thyroid cancer cells achieved with
Akt and mTOR inhibitors, we next used the shRNA approach to
explore the inhibitory effects of suppressing the PI3K/Akt pathway
by specific knockdown of Akt or mTOR. Four thyroid cancer cell
lines, including FTC133, OCUT1, SW1736, and KAT18, were chosen
for these experiments. In FTC133 cells, transient knockdown of
Akt-1 or Akt-2 individually by siRNA partially suppressed cell
proliferation and colony formation, and knockdown of both Akt-1
and Akt-2 resulted in a synergistic and remarkable inhibitory effect
(data not shown). As Akt-1 and Akt-2 were the most abundant and
important isoforms of Akt in thyroid cancer (27), we chose to
knock down the two isofomes (Akt-1/2) simultaneously for stable
transfection experiments. With this approach, we were able to
knock down Akt-1/2 in all the four cell lines with corresponding
down-regulation of p-Akt (Fig. 3A). We were able to partially knock
down mTOR in the four cell lines with corresponding downregulation of p-p70S6K (Fig. 3B). Knockdown of Akt-1/2 inhibited
proliferation of FTC133 and OCUT1 cells, but not SW1736 and
KAT18 cells (Fig. 3C). Similarly, partial knockdown of mTOR
partially inhibited proliferation of FTC133 and OCUT1 cells but not

www.aacrjournals.org

SW1736 and KAT18 cells (Fig. 3C). These results were consistent
with the genetic-dependent effects of perifosine and temsirolimus
on thyroid cancer cells (Table 1; Fig. 2).
Genetic-selective inhibition of cell colony formation by
siRNA targeting PI3K/Akt pathway. We also investigated the
effects of stable knockdown of Akt-1/2 or mTOR on colony
formation of FTC133, OCUT1, SW1736, and KAT18 cells in soft agar
(i.e., anchorage-independent cell growth), a characteristic feature of
cellular transformation. As shown in Supplementary Fig. S1A,
colony formation of FTC133 and OCUT1 cells, but not as much
SW1736 and KAT18 cells, was inhibited by Akt-1/2 knockdown, in
both colony number and size. Similarly, mTOR knockdown
significantly inhibited the colony formation of FTC133 and OCUT1
cells but not SW1736 and KAT18 cells (Supplementary Fig. S1A).
Supplementary Fig. S1B illustrates more clearly the differential
effects of knockdown of Akt-1/2 or mTOR on the colony formation
of the four cells. These results showed the importance of genetic
alterations of the PI3K/Akt pathway in maintaining the malignant
and transformed state of thyroid cancer cells, further supporting
the potential effectiveness of genetic-selective therapy of drugs
targeting the PI3K/Akt pathway for thyroid cancer.
Expression of mutant PIK3CA increased the sensitivity of
SW1736 cells to perifosine and temsirolimus. We next tested
whether introduction of mutant PIK3CA into thyroid cancer cells
that did not harbor genetic alterations in PI3K/Akt pathway could
increase the sensitivity of cells to perifosine and temsirolimus. Two
PIK3CA mutants, including H1047R and E545K that are the most
common mutations of PIK3CA found in human cancer and showed
strong oncogenic effects when transfected in breast cell lines (28),
were used to transfect SW1736 cells. Fig. 4A and B shows stable
expression of exogenous PIK3CA mutants and the corresponding
increase in p-Akt level in cells transfected with the PIK3CA mutants.
The proliferation of cells transfected with PIK3CA mutants was
more potently inhibited by perifosine and temsirolimus than the
cells transfected with control vector (Fig. 4C). For cells transfected
with vector, H1047R and E545K, the IC50 values of perifosine were
30.55, 4.26, and 6.14 Amol/L, respectively, and IC50 values of
temsirolimus were >1,000, 3.57, and 10.52 nmol/L, respectively.
Genetic-selective induction of thyroid cancer cell apoptosis
and inhibition of xenograft tumor growth by the Akt inhibitor
perifosine. To investigate whether genetic-dependent effects of
perifosine and temsirolimus on cell growth involved cell death, we
examined proapoptotic effects of the two inhibitors on thyroid
cancer cell lines using nuclear morphologic analysis as described in
Material and Methods. After treatment with perifosine, chromatin
condensation, margination and nuclear fragmentation, which are
characteristic morphologies of apoptotic nuclear (23), were
frequently observed in FTC133 and OCUT1 cells that harbored
genetic alterations in the PI3K/Akt pathway but not in SW1736 and
KAT18 cells that did not (Fig. 5A). The apoptotic cell number
increased >20-fold in the former two cells, whereas it only
minimally increased in the latter two cells after treatment with
perifosine (Fig. 5B). We did not see effects of temsirolimus on cell
apoptosis in these four thyroid cancer cell lines (data not shown).
Because cell apoptosis was an important mechanism in the
genetic-dependent inhibition of thyroid cancer cell growth induced
by perifosine, perifosine has a potential to be highly effective in
treating thyroid cancer in vivo. We therefore next tested the geneticdependent effect of perifosine on the growth of xenograft thyroid
tumors in nude mice. As shown in Fig. 5C, the PTEN-deficient
FTC133 cell–derived xenograft tumors progressively grew in the

Figure 3. Genetic-selective inhibition of cell proliferation by siRNA targeting the PI3K/Akt pathway. A, FTC133, OCUT1, SW1736, or KAT18 cells were infected with
lentivirus expressing Akt-1/2 siRNA or control lentivirus packaged with empty vector. Stable cell pools, selected with puromycin, were lysed and immunoblotted
with corresponding antibodies as described in Materials and Methods. The antibody against h-actin was used for quality control of Western blotting. B, similar procedure
was performed using specific siRNA to knock down mTOR. C, comparison of proliferation rates of FTC133 OCUT1, SW1736, and KAT18 cells with/without stable

shrinked in perifosine-treated group. At the end of the experiment
after a 2-week treatment, the tumor volumes and weights were
1.807 F 0.774 cm3 (control group) versus 0.177 F 0.095 cm3
(perifosine group; P = 0.005) and 1.567 F 0.265 g (control group)
versus 0.198 F 0.051 g (perifosine group; P < 0.001), respectively
(Fig. 5C). In contrast, perifosine only had a minimal inhibitory effect
on the growth of SW1736-derived xenograft tumors that did not
harbor genetic alterations in the PI3K/Akt pathway (Fig. 5D). At the
end of the experiment after a 2-week treatment, the tumor volumes
and weights were 0.449 F 0.121 cm3 (control group) versus 0.315 F

Discussion
Thyroid cancer is the most common endocrine malignancy with
a rapidly increasing incidence in recent decades (29–31), posing an

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (18). September 15, 2009

increasing challenge to the treatment of this cancer. Although
surgical and radioiodine treatments are generally effective, many
thyroid cancer patients have persistent or recurrent disease that
is currently incurable and associated with increased morbidity and
mortality. PDTC and ATC, which can derive from PTC and FTC or
develop de novo, are particularly difficult to treat (32, 33). In fact,
ATC is one of the most aggressive and deadly human cancers. New
therapies are needed for incurable thyroid cancers. The recent
several clinical trials on receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors in
thyroid cancers are promising but the results are still limited at this
stage (34–36). More effective molecular-targeted therapeutic
strategies need to be developed based on molecular mechanisms,
particularly the derangements in major signaling pathways, in
thyroid cancer.
The PI3K/Akt pathway is a well-explored therapeutic target in
human cancers (2, 3, 37). Given the important role of the PI3K/Akt
pathway and its common genetic alterations in thyroid cancer (1, 9,
10, 38), in the present study, we tested the therapeutic potential of

PI3K/Akt Genotype-Dependent Inhibition of Thyroid Cancer

targeting this pathway, with a focus on its genotype dependence
and the potential of using genetic alterations in this pathway to
predict the sensitivity of thyroid cancer cells. Various inhibitors
targeting this pathway have been developed for therapeutic testing.
Among these are the Akt inhibitors and mTOR inhibitors, which
target two key steps, Akt and mTOR, respectively in this pathway.
The Akt inhibitor perifosine and mTOR inhibitor temsirolimus are
among the most promising inhibitors, which have been or are
being actively tested in clinical trials and have shown acceptable
toxicity profiles and great promises in some cancers (4, 5, 39, 40).
They were therefore specifically tested in the present study.
We showed a striking dependency of perifosine and temsirolimus, particularly the former, on genetic alterations in the PI3K/Akt
pathway in the inhibition of thyroid cancer cells. Specific
knockdown of Akt and mTOR using shRNA approaches showed
identical genetic dependence patterns in inhibiting the proliferation and anchorage-independent colony formation of thyroid
cancer cells. Moreover, transfection of cells with PIK3CA mutants
conferred increased sensitivity to perifosine and temsirolimus in
cells that did not naturally harbor genetic alterations in the
PI3K/Akt pathway. These results suggest that the results obtained
with drug inhibitors were indeed genetic-specific. The one
exception that showed inconsistent genetic-dependent pattern

was the WRO cell, which did not harbor genetic alterations at or
upstream of Akt in the PI3K/Akt pathway and, as expected, was
highly resistant to the Akt inhibitor perifosine, but was highly
sensitive to the mTOR inhibitor temsirolimus. It is likely that an
uncharacterized Akt-independent mechanism played a major role
in the activation of mTOR signaling in this cell as shown in other
cancer cells (41). This mechanism might also occur in the Hth74
cell that did not harbor genetic alterations in the PI3K/Akt
pathway and was highly resistant to perifosine but was fairly well
sensitive to temsirolimus.
The results in the present study also suggest that thyroid cancer
cells are highly addictive to the PI3K/Akt signaling when genetic
alterations in this pathway are present, similar to breast cancer
cells (42, 43) and lung cancer cells (44). It is important to note that
the PI3K/Akt-associated genetic alterations tested in the present
study, such as PIK3CA, Ras, and PTEN mutations and PIK3CA
amplifications, are particularly common in aggressive thyroid
cancers, such as PDTC and ATC (13, 14, 17, 18). Therefore, geneticbased targeting of the PI3K/Akt pathway using perifosine or
temsirolimus may be a particularly promising therapeutic strategy
for these therapeutically challenging thyroid cancers. It is worth
noting that the dramatic inhibition of cell proliferation was
achieved in cells harboring genetic alterations with perifosine at

Figure 4. Expression of mutant PIK3CA increased the sensitivity of SW1736 cells to perifosine and temsirolimus. A, stable expression of PIK3CA mutants H1047R or
E545K in SW1736 cells. SW1736 cells were transfected with lentiviral vectors containing mutant PIK3CA or empty vectors and selected with blastomycin for 2 wk.
Stable cell pools were lysed and immunoblotted with antibody against V5 tag or p-Akt to detect the expression of exogenous PIK3CA mutant and p-Akt level. The
antibody against h-actin was used for quality control in Western blotting. B, quantitative illustration of relative p-Akt levels. Densitometry was performed to measure the
density of the p-Akt and h-actin bands in Fig. 4A. The relative p-Akt levels were obtained by dividing the p-Akt band density by the corresponding h-actin band density.
C, effects of perifosine (left ) or temsirolimus (right ) on the proliferation of SW1736 cells transfected with PIK3CA constructs. Cells were treated with perifosine or
temsirolimus at the indicated concentrations for 5 d with the culture medium and the drug replenished every 24 h. MTT assay was used to measure cell proliferation and
IC50 values were calculated according to the Reed-Muench method (21).

Figure 5. Genetic-selective induction of thyroid cancer cell apoptosis and inhibition of the xenograft thyroid tumor growth by the Akt inhibitor perifosine.
A, representative morphology of cell nuclei after treatment with or without perifosine. Cells were treated with 5 Amol/L perifosine for 48 h and apoptotic cells were
determined by Hoechst 33342 staining. Cells were observed under a fluorescent microscope and selective apoptotic nuclei are indicated with arrows, showing
chromatin margination, condensation, and fragmentation, which are characteristics of apoptosis. B, quantitation of the number of apoptotic cells by examining
500 cells under a fluorescent microscope for each sample. C, effects of perifosine on the growth of xenograft tumor derived from FTC133 cells. Left, the time course of
tumor growth, measured as the average tumor volume in each group at the indicated time of treatment with vehicle (PBS) or perifosine, 25 mg/kg/d peritoneally.
Points, mean of the values obtained from four mice in each group; bars, SD. Right, FTC133-derived tumor weights from the four individual mice in each group
after a 2-wk treatment. Animals were finally sacrificed and xenograft tumors were surgically removed and weighted. Short horizontal bar, the average weight

the concentrations around 5 to 10 Amol/L, which was within the
clinically achievable and safe peak plasma concentration ranges
(i.e., 10–15 Amol/L; refs. 45, 46). The potency of temsirolimus in the
sensitive cells was extremely high, with IC50 in the nanomolar
range, consistent with previous findings that temsirolimus at
the nanomolar range effectively suppressed the growth of cancer
cells (47). Because cell apoptosis was a major mechanism in
genetic-dependent inhibition of thyroid cancer cells by perifosine,
this inhibitor may have a particularly high clinical potential for
effective treatment of thyroid cancer, as supported by its profound
genetic-dependent inhibitory effect on the growth of xenograft
thyroid tumors.
In summary, we have shown that genetic alterations in the
PI3K/Akt pathway confer strong sensitivity of thyroid cancer cells
to inhibition by targeting Akt or mTOR. It may thus be possible to
use genetic markers in the PI3K/Akt pathway to predict the
responses of thyroid cancer to specific inhibitors of this pathway.

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (18). September 15, 2009

Given the common genetic alterations in the PI3K/Akt pathway in
thyroid cancer, particularly aggressive and incurable types,
perifosine and temsirolimus, which have well shown acceptable
clinical profiles, are highly promising in genetic-targeted therapies
for thyroid cancer.

In this article (Cancer Res 2009;69:7311–9) which was published in the September 15, 2009
issue of Cancer Research (1), all of the concentration units reported in Fig. 2B and the right
panel of Fig. 4C should be nmol/L, not Amol/L. Also, the right panel of Fig. 4C is missing the last
bar, which should represent the growth of SW1736 cells transfected with E545K PIK3CA and
treated with temsirolimus at the concentration point of 40 nmol/L. The value represented by
this missing bar is 49.5, which has been counted in the calculation of the IC50 value of
temsirolimus.
