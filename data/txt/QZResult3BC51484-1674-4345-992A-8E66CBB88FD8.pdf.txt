eukaryotic DNA into chromatin plays an active role in transcriptional regulation by interfering with the accessibility to the
transcription factors (2). Acetylation of specific lysine residues
within the NH2-terminal tails of nucleosomal histones is generally
linked to chromatin disruption and transcriptional activation of
genes (3). Consistent with their role in altering chromatin
structure, many transcriptional coactivators, including hGCN5,
p300/CBP, PCAF, and SRC-1, possess intrinsic acetyltransferase
activity that is critical for their function (4, 5). Similarly, corepressor
complexes include proteins that have deacetylase activity (6). Until
now, more than 40 transcription factors and 30 other proteins are
acetylated on lysine residues, and their function is thereby
regulated (7–13). Depending on the functional domain that is
modified, acetylation can regulate different functions of these
nonhistone proteins, such as DNA recognition, protein stability,
protein-protein interaction, and subcellular localization (14). Thus,
dysregulation of the balance between protein acetylation and
deacetylation is often associated with the initiation of tumorigenesis and other diseases (15).
Nuclear factor-nB (NF-nB) is a ubiquitously expressed family of
transcription factors controlling the expression of numerous genes
involved in inflammatory and immune responses and cellular
proliferation (16). In mammals, the most abundant form of NF-nB
is a heterodimer of p50 and p65 (17). The RelA (p65) subunit of NFnB is also known to be activated in an acetylation-dependent
manner in response to cytokine stimulation (18, 19). Deacetylation
of p65 promotes its effective binding to InBa and leads to InBadependent nuclear export of the NF-nB complex by a CRM-1–
dependent pathway (18). Reversible acetylation of p65 thus
functions as a molecular switch that both controls the duration
of the NF-nB transcriptional response (20). Given the ubiquitous
expression of NF-nB and the important number of inducing stimuli
as well as target genes, it is not surprising that NF-nB is involved in
numerous and diverse diseases, such as the maintenance of
chronic inflammation and asthma, the survival of cancer cells, and
the resistance of cancer cells to treatment (17, 21). Therefore, NFnB is an interesting target for pharmaceutical interference with the
establishment and the progression of these pathologic states.
Among the small molecules that are capable of modulating
epigenetic status, HDAC inhibitors have been extensively studied
and several are currently in clinical trials (22). One example is
vorinostat, which has been approved by the Food and Drug
Administration for the treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma
(23). On the other hand, there is little information available on
inhibitors of HATs (HATi). As suggested in recent studies, the

Abstract
Because the p300/CBP-mediated hyperacetylation of RelA
(p65) is critical for nuclear factor-KB (NF-KB) activation, the
attenuation of p65 acetylation is a potential molecular target
for the prevention of chronic inflammation. During our
ongoing screening study to identify natural compounds with
histone acetyltransferase inhibitor (HATi) activity, we identified epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) as a novel HATi with
global specificity for the majority of HAT enzymes but with no
activity toward epigenetic enzymes including HDAC, SIRT1,
and HMTase. At a dose of 100 Mmol/L, EGCG abrogates p300induced p65 acetylation in vitro and in vivo, increases the level
of cytosolic IKBA, and suppresses tumor necrosis factor A
(TNFA)–induced NF-KB activation. We also showed that EGCG
prevents TNFA-induced p65 translocation to the nucleus,
confirming that hyperacetylation is critical for NF-KB translocation as well as activity. Furthermore, EGCG treatment
inhibited the acetylation of p65 and the expression of NF-KB
target genes in response to diverse stimuli. Finally, EGCG
reduced the binding of p300 to the promoter region of
interleukin-6 gene with an increased recruitment of HDAC3,
which highlights the importance of the balance between HATs
and histone deacetylases in the NF-KB–mediated inflammatory signaling pathway. Importantly, EGCG at 50 Mmol/L dose
completely blocks EBV infection-induced cytokine expression
and subsequently the EBV-induced B lymphocyte transformation. These results show the crucial role of acetylation in the
development of inflammatory-related diseases. [Cancer Res

Introduction
Protein acetylation influences a broad set of cellular processes,
including diverse aspects of transcriptional regulation, through the
recruitment of enzymes: the histone deacetylases (HDAC) and the
histone acetyltransferases (HAT; ref. 1). The packaging of

filters (Millipore). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC; Yonsei
University Health System Blood Bank) were infected with concentrated
virus for 3 h and cultured in RPMI 1640 plus 10% FCS for 3 wk. Medium,
plus or minus EGCG, was replaced weekly. Assays were performed in fivewell replicates. Colony outgrowth was monitored by using phase-contrast
microscopy.
ELISA and cytokine antibody array. IL-6 was measured with a human
IL-6 TiterZyme Enzyme Immunometric Assay kit (Assay Designs) according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. Values were calculated based on a
standard curve constructed for each assay. For analyzing cytokine
expression profile, TransSignal Human Cytokine Antibody Array 3.0
membranes (Panomics) were incubated with conditioned medium from

visualized using LAS 3000 image analyzer (Fuji).

development of HATis from dietary compounds, such as garcinol,
curcumin, and anacardic acid, is the next therapeutic goal
(24, 25). Garcinol has been found to inhibit p300 and PCAF
in vitro and in vivo, anacardic acid to inhibit TIP60 as well as p300
and PCAF, and curcumin to inhibit p300 and PCAF (24). These
dietary compounds are associated with the prevention of cancer
and other diseases.
Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), the major polyphenol found
in green tea, is reported to have an anti-NF-nB transactivation
activity in a broad range of human malignancies, such as colon
cancer, lung cancer, breast cancer, and in chronic inflammation
(26, 27). Recently, EGCG has been shown to inhibit the production
of nitric oxide synthase (NOS2) by blocking the NF-nB signal
transduction pathway (28). Although EGCG is also known to
suppress NF-nB activation and phosphorylation of p38 mitogenactivated protein kinase and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (29), it is
still unclear how EGCG regulates NF-nB–dependent activation
whether via inhibiting the stabilities or activities of proteins. In this
study, we first report that EGCG possesses potent anti-HAT activity
and shows global specificity for the majority of HAT enzymes. Our
studies show that EGCG generally induces hypoacetylation of p65
by directly inhibiting the activity of HAT enzymes. This hypoacetylation of p65 led to the down-regulation of NF-nB function by
diverse inflammatory signals. In addition, EGCG totally blocks EBVinduced B-cell transformation by suppressing viral protein-induced
acetylation of p65. In summation, this study shows that selective
modulation of NF-nB acetylation by HATi is a potential mechanism
for a new class of anti-inflammatory and chemopreventive drugs.

Results
EGCG is a specific inhibitor of HAT activity. During our
ongoing screening study to identify natural compounds with antiHAT activity, we found that green tea extract had potent anti-HAT
activity. Green tea extract contains polyphenols, which are
composed of catechin derivatives; thus, we first decided to
examine whether catechin derivatives possess anti-HAT activity.
Most catechin derivatives, including catechin, epicatechin, and
epigallocatechin, exhibited low levels of anti-HAT activity, whereas
EGCG inhibited 90% of HAT activity in a dose-dependent manner
(Fig. 1A and B). To examine the enzyme specificity, we first sought
to assess the effect of EGCG on HDAC and histone methyltransferase (HMT) activities. When HeLa NE was used as a source of
histone deacetylase enzymes, deacetylation activity was not
affected by the presence of EGCG, but trichostatin A (TSA)
efficiently blocked nuclear HDAC activity (Fig. 1C). This suggests
that EGCG did not possess specificity for HDAC. We next
investigated the effect of EGCG on HMT activity. HeLa core
histones were methylated with [3H]S-adenosylmethionine by
recombinant lysine methyltransferase SET7/9, which specifically
methylates lysine residues 9 and 27 of histone H3. As shown by
Fig. 1D, histone methylation by SET7/9 remains the same in the
presence or absence of EGCG. The same result was also observed
with NE as an enzyme source (data not shown). Similar to the
results of the HDAC and HMT assays, the SIRT deacetylase assay
also showed no difference either in the presence or absence of
EGCG (Supplementary Fig. S1A). We next determined whether
EGCG was a general HATi or was a specific HATi. The HAT activity
was measured using recombinant HAT p300 and CBP as enzyme
sources. EGCG was found to be a highly efficient inhibitor of p300
and CBP acetyltransferase activities with an IC50 of f30 Amol/L
and f50 Amol/L, respectively (Fig. 2A). Under similar conditions,
EGCG also inhibited immunoprecipitated PCAF and TIP60
acetyltransferase activities with an IC50 of f60 Amol/L and
f70 Amol/L, respectively, although to a lesser extent, suggesting
that EGCG generally inhibited most HAT enzyme activities
(Fig. 2B). To understand the mechanism of EGCG-mediated
p300/CBP HAT activity, we investigated the enzyme kinetics by
changing the histone concentration while keeping all other
concentrations constant at once. The K m and V max were decreased
by EGCG treatment in both cases, showing that EGCG does not
bind to the active sites of histone but to some other site on the
enzyme. These data show that EGCG uncompetitively inhibits
p300/CBP HAT activity (Supplementary Fig. S1B).
To assess the EGCG-mediated inhibition of HAT activity toward
the synthetic H4 tail peptide, we analyzed radiolabeled H4 tail

Materials and Methods
Cell culture and reagents. All cell lines were obtained from the
American Type Culture Collection. HEK293 cells were cultured in DMEM
and THP-1 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 (Hyclone) and supplemented
with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Hyclone), 1% antibiotics, and
antimycotics (Hyclone). All cell lines were grown at 37jC in 5% CO2. The
Effectene transfection reagent was purchased from Qiagen.
Mouse experiments. We maintained male BALB/c mice (6 wk old)
approximately 20 to 25 g in body weight in accordance with the guidelines
and under approval of the Animal Care Committee of Yonsei University
(Seoul, South Korea). Mouse peritoneal macrophages were isolated
according to the method described previously (30). Peritoneal cells were
washed in PBS and cultured at 37jC under 5% CO2 in DMEM supplemented
with L-glutamine, antibiotics, and 10% FBS. After incubation for 2 d, cells
treated with EGCG were cultured for 2 h by tumor necrosis factor a (TNFa;
20 ng/mL) treatment and then harvested.
HAT and HDAC activity assay. HeLa cell nuclear extract (NE) was
prepared as previously described (31). HAT activity and HDAC activity
assays were determined using a commercial available kit (Biovision
Biotechnology) according to the manufacturer’s instruction. SIRT1 deacetylase activity was assayed with SIRT1/Sir2 Deacetylase Fluorometric Assay
kit (CycLex).
RNA extraction, reverse transcription-PCR, and chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis. RNA extraction, reverse transcription-PCR (RTPCR), and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) were performed as
described (31). The antibodies against p65, acetyl-p65, HDAC3, and p300

EGCG Is a Histone Acetyltransferase Inhibitor

Supplementary Fig. S1C, histone H4 tail peptide in vitro was
acetylated efficiently by GST-p300 (HAT) but not by GST-p300
(DHAT). We next performed in vitro acetylation assays with
recombinant p300 domain proteins in the presence or absence of
EGCG using GST-p65 protein as a substrate. As shown in Fig. 3A,
the acetylation of GST-p65 was detected in the presence of active
GST-p300 but not in the presence of GST-p300 (DHAT). On EGCG
treatment, the p300-induced acetylation was abrogated, confirming
that EGCG prevented the hyperacetylation of p65 in vitro. To
further substantiate the prevention of p65 acetylation by EGCG, we
next determined the effect of EGCG treatment on TNFa-induced
acetylation of p65 in HEK293 cells. TNFa-treated HEK293 cells
were cultured either in the presence or absence of EGCG. The cells
were collected, and subsequent Western blot analysis was
performed using antibody against acetylated p65 (lysine 310). As
shown in Fig. 3B, EGCG treatment reversed TNFa-enhanced
acetylation of p65 in HEK293 cells. Taken together, we conclude
that EGCG prevents the hyperacetylation of p65 by inhibiting the
HAT activity of p300/CBP.
NF-nB has also been shown to interact with HDAC3, which
seems to be crucial for the deacetylation of p65 (20). It has been
reported that the reversible acetylation causes exchange between
the HDACs and HATs in the promoter region of a T3R-regulated
gene (31). Therefore, we hypothesized that the balance between
HDAC and HAT activity determines the level of p65 acetylation and

peptide by SDS-PAGE and fluorography. The results were similar
to the observation made for the HAT activity colorimetric assays.
Compared with other catechin derivatives, EGCG strongly
quenched HAT activity (Fig. 2C). After establishing EGCG as a
strong inhibitor of HATs in vitro, we further investigated whether
it could also affect the acetylation of histone tails in vivo. For this
purpose, we examined the histone acetylation status of chromatin
by ChIP assay. It has been reported that T3 hormone induces
histone acetylation in the promoter region of the thyroid hormone
receptor-regulated gene, deiodinase 1 (D1; refs. 6, 31). Treatment of
EGCG reversed the T3-stimulated acetylation of histone H3 and H4
by p300/CBP in the D1 promoter but not the GAPDH promoter
negative control (Fig. 2D). These results therefore established that
EGCG is a specific and global inhibitor of HAT activity but not
other enzymes for which histones are the substrate.
EGCG-induced hypoacetylation of p65 resulted in exchange
between HDACs and HATs in the promoter region of a NF-KB–
regulated gene. Based on recent studies showing that EGCG
inhibits inflammatory signaling in a broad range of human cancer
cells and bronchial epithelial cells, we next sought to investigate
whether EGCG inhibits the acetylation of p65 both in vitro and
in vivo. As p300 acetyltransferase has been already known to play a
major role in the acetylation of p65, we generated the active p300
(HAT) protein and the p300 (DHAT) HAT activity-defective mutant
to confirm whether p300 directly acetylates p65. As shown in

Figure 1. EGCG has specific anti-HAT activity. A, EGCG has potent anti-HAT activity toward catechin derivatives. HAT activity was assayed with a HAT activity

HDAC activity. Columns, average of three independent experiments; bars, SD. D, HMT assays were performed in 30 AL reaction in the presence or absence of EGCG
using recombinant SET7/9 as the enzyme sources and then processed for filter binding assay.

Figure 2. EGCG exhibits a broad range of substrate specificity. HAT activity colorimetric assays were performed with an increased amount of GST-CBP (A, left ),
GST-p300 (A, right ), immunoprecipitated TIP60 (B, left), and PCAF (B, right ). C, in vitro HAT activity assays were performed with HAT enzymes in the presence
or absence of catechin derivatives (100 Amol/L) using a synthetic H4 tail peptide and subsequently processed for fluorography. D, EGCG inhibits hypoacetylation
of histone tails in chromatin. A diagram of the D1 promoter showing the positions of TREs and primers used for PCR amplification in ChIP assays. The P1 pair
primers amplify a DNA fragment f2.5 kb downstream of the transcriptional start site. A ChIP assay was performed with HeLa a2 treated with EGCG in the presence of
T3 (1 h). The histone modification of the D1 gene was then assessed by ChIP assays using the indicated antibodies.

NF-nB probe, a protein-DNA complex specific for the NF-nB probe
was observed in the gel shift assay (Fig. 4A, right, lanes 1 and 2).
However, EGCG treatment reduced the enhanced NF-nB DNAbinding activity induced by TSA treatment, suggesting that the
level of acetylation determines the DNA-binding activity of NF-nB
(Fig. 4A, left, lanes 3–5). Supershift analysis indicated that the
protein/DNA complex observed actually contained p65 (Fig. 4A,
left). To substantiate this result, we carried out ChIP assays over the
promoter region of the IL-6 gene in HEK293 and THP-1 cells. Cells
were then collected and processed for ChIP assay using antibodies
to p65 or acetylated p65. To more precisely measure the
recruitment of p65 and acetylated p65, we used real-time PCR
analysis. A representative result is presented in Fig. 4B and shows
that TNFa treatment increased the recruitment of acetylated p65
to the promoter of the IL-6 gene but not the b-actin gene. The
enhanced recruitment of acetylated p65 was abolished by
treatment with EGCG, which agrees with the results of the EMSA.
Because the dissociation of InBa and nuclear translocation of
NF-nB are critical for NF-nB activation (18), we determined
whether EGCG-mediated hypoacetylation of p65 enhances the
association of InBa with p65. As shown in Fig. 4C, EGCG treatment

subsequently the expression levels of NF-nB–regulated genes. We
tested this hypothesis by assessing the effect of EGCG on the
recruitment of HDAC3 or p300 to the promoter region of the IL-6
gene. The IL-6 gene promoter contains a well-characterized NFnB–binding site located at 75 to 63 relative to the transcriptional start site (Fig. 3C). We used ChIP assays to determine
whether HDAC3 or p300 associated with the IL-6 promoter in THP1 cells treated with or without TNFa. As shown in Fig. 3C, TNFa
treatment led to a significant increase in binding of p300 to the NFnB–binding site of the IL-6 gene. However, addition of EGCG
resulted in the enhanced recruitment of HDAC3 to the NF-nB–
binding site of the IL-6 gene. The recruitment of p300 was
abolished by treatment with EGCG, confirming the importance of
the balance between HATs and HDACs to the NF-nB–mediated
inflammatory signal.
Hypoacetylation of p65 by EGCG treatment led to loss of
NF-KB function. RelA acetylation plays a critical role in the
nuclear function of NF-nB (18, 19, 32). Therefore, we first examined
the effect of EGCG on TNFa-induced DNA-binding activity of NFnB by performing electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA).
When TNFa-treated HEK293 NE was incubated with radiolabeled

EGCG Is a Histone Acetyltransferase Inhibitor

Due to the important role of NF-nB in the regulation of a variety of
key inflammatory mediators, we next determined whether EGCG
inhibited TNFa-induced transcription of NF-nB–regulated genes by
performing real-time PCR analysis. As shown in Fig. 5B, EGCG
greatly reduced TNFa-induced expression of IL-6, COX-2, and NOS2
in both HEK293 and THP-1 cells. Similar results were also observed
in primary peritoneal macrophages. Consistent with these results,
EGCG dramatically reduced protein levels of these target genes
(Supplementary Fig. S2A). In addition, we also assessed the effect
of EGCG on the release of inflammatory markers from THP-1 cell
cultures. EGCG treatment of cells resulted in a significant
inhibition of the TNFa-induced increase in the expression of
IL-6, depicting EGCG as a potent anti-inflammatory molecule
(Fig. 5C). Next, we investigated whether EGCG could also inhibit
the production of TNFa-induced inflammatory molecules
in vivo. We pretreated 6-week-old male mice with 50 mg EGCG/
kg body weight by oral administration for 4 weeks, and then we i.p.
injected 0.5 mg TNFa/kg body weight. After 2 hours, serum IL-6
levels were measured. As shown in Fig. 5D, EGCG dramatically
decreased TNFa-induced serum levels of IL-6 compared with
levels in the control group. Consistent with this, we also
observed reduced levels of p65 acetylation in primary peritoneal

led to the restoration of the association of InBa with p65, which
was abrogated by TNFa treatment. In support of this result, EGCG
increased the level of cytosolic InBaeven in the presence of TNFa.
These data indicated that deacetylation events lead to a
cytoplasmic accumulation of InBaand subsequent cytosolic
sequestration of NF-nB. We next determined whether hypoacetylation by EGCG inhibits the nuclear translocation of p65 by
performing immunohistochemistry analysis. As shown in Fig. 4D,
EGCG reversed TNFa-induced nuclear translocation of p65 and
enhanced nuclear export of hypoacetylated p65. It is noteworthy
that the treatment with LMB, a specific inhibitor of nuclear protein
export, abrogated nuclear export of hypoacetylated p65, suggesting
that the level of acetylation is critical for NF-nB translocation.
These results therefore established that hypoacetylation of p65 by
EGCG induced the loss of NF-nB nuclear function by enhancing
nuclear export of p65, increasing the subsequent association with
the inhibitory protein InBa, and impairing DNA-binding activity.
EGCG down-regulates the TNFA-induced NF-KB–dependent
inflammatory response. To determine whether EGCG regulates
TNFa-induced NF-nB activation and the inflammatory response,
we measured NF-nB–dependent promoter activity. EGCG dose
dependently inhibited TNFa-induced NF-nB activation (Fig. 5A).

Figure 3. EGCG-induced hypoacetylation of p65 leads to an exchange between p300 and HDAC3 in the promoter region of the NF-nB–regulated gene IL-6. A,
EGCG prevents p300-mediated p65 acetylation in vitro. Either recombinant GST-p300 or GST-p300 (D) was incubated with GST-p65 in the presence or absence
of EGCG and subsequently processed for Western blot analysis using antibody against acetylated lysine (310) p65. CBS, Coomassie blue staining. B, EGCG treatment
prevented TNFa-induced p65 acetylation in vivo . HEK293 cells were treated with TNFa and/or 100 Amol/L EGCG. The level of p65 acetylation was assayed by
Western blot analysis using antibody against acetylated lysine (310) p65. C, EGCG-induced p65 hypoacetylation resulted in the association of HDA3 and the
dissociation of p300 with the IL-6 promoter region. HEK293 cells were treated with TNFa and/or EGCG for various times as indicated. ChIP assay was then carried
out to determine the binding of HDAC3 and p300.

Figure 4. Hypoacetylation of p65 by EGCG treatment led to loss of NF-nB function. A, an electromobility assay was performed in the presence of TNFa and/or
EGCG as indicated. EGCG treatment resulted in a dose-dependent reduction of DNA binding of NF-nB in cells treated with TNFa. Note that EGCG treatment reversed
the effect of TSA on the DNA-binding activity of p65. The nonspecific band is indicated by *. S.S, supershift. B, the increased association of p65 and acetylated
p65 with the IL-6 gene was abolished on EGCG treatment. HEK293 cells were treated with TNFa and/or EGCG for various times as indicated. ChIP assay was then

infection of B cells. As shown in Fig. 6A, EGCG treatment
abrogated EBV-enhanced acetylation of p65 in the B cells.
Consistent with this result, EGCG increased the level of cytosolic
InBa even in EBV-infected B cells. The activation of NF-nB by viral
proteins is also related to the induction of proinflammatory
cytokines, including IL-6 and IL-12, and these cytokines are
elevated in EBV-associated cancer patients (36). Thus, we examined
the effect of EGCG on the expression of proinflammatory cytokine
genes on EBV infection. EBV infection dramatically increased the
mRNA levels of IL-6 and IL-12, whereas EGCG treatment reduced
both mRNA and protein levels of these target genes (Fig. 6B).
Moreover, Human Cytokine Antibody Array 3.0 analysis showed
that levels of IL-4, IL-6, IL-12, transforming growth factor h, IFN-g,
and IL-1h were all increased from EBV-positive cells compared
with controls. Conversely, treatment of EBV-positive cells with
EGCG reversed the elevated cytokine expression profile in the EBVpositive B cells (Fig. 6C). Together, these results suggest that EGCG
suppressed EBV infection-mediated induction of proinflammatory
cytokines.
We next evaluated the ability of EGCG to prevent EBV-induced
initiation of B-cell proliferation by using human PBMCs. Human
PBMCs were incubated in the presence or absence of EBV virus
obtained from induced B95.8 cells. After 3 weeks of incubation, the

macrophages following EGCG treatment (Supplementary Fig. S2B).
Taken together, these data show that EGCG inhibits the TNFainduced p65-dependent inflammatory response in vitro and in vivo.
Because multiple stimuli-mediated inflammatory responses have
been reported, we next examined whether EGCG generally inhibits
inflammatory responses by other stimuli, including lipopolysaccharide (LPS), IFN-g, and IL-1h. EGCG efficiently blocked
acetylation of p65 stimulated by LPS, IFN-g, and IL-1h. Consistently, EGCG also inhibited the release of IL-6 by HEK293 cell
cultures exposed to various inflammatory stimuli, suggesting that
EGCG generally inhibits inflammatory responses (Supplementary
Fig. S2C).
The acetylation of RelA (p65) is a potent therapeutic target
for EBV-associated B lymphocyte transformation. We next
tested the therapeutic potential of EGCG for the treatment of
chronic inflammation–associated diseases. Chronic inflammation
is linked to carcinogenesis in several organ systems and infectionrelated tumorigenesis, such as EBV-associated B-cell lymphoma
and human papillomavirus–related cervical cancer (33, 34).
Importantly, the continuous low-grade activation of NF-nB is

EGCG Is a Histone Acetyltransferase Inhibitor

NF-nB is also known to be activated in an acetylation-dependent
manner on treatment with cytokines (18). Thus, acetylation of p65
increases its DNA-binding affinity, transcriptional activation, and
InBa disassembly. Coactivators, especially p300 and CBP, contain
intrinsic HAT activity toward p65 and therefore can regulate
inflammatory signals (19). Interestingly, the deacetylase inhibitor
TSA was shown to potentiate the acetyltransferase activity of p300/
CBP and thereby enhance NF-nB–dependent activation (20). This
phenomenon created an opportunity for the identification of
selective acetylation inhibitors for the attenuation of hyperinflammatory responses.
During our ongoing screening study to identify natural
compounds with anti-HAT activity, we first found potent antiHAT activity in a green tea extract that contained polyphenol
compounds such as EGCG. EGCG possessed a global specificity for
the majority of HAT enzymes but not other epigenetic enzymes,

wells were examined for outgrowth of clumps of proliferating B
cells. EGCG was added just before virus infection and replenished
weekly. Cells in uninfected controls and EBV-infected EGCGpretreated wells were dying and no microscopic colonies were
visible, whereas wells that were infected with EBV without EGCG
pretreatment contained large numbers of macroscopic colonies
(Fig. 6D). Thus, the EGCG inhibited the EBV-mediated B-cell
transformation by blocking acetylation of p65. These data raise the
possibility that HATis can be developed for chemoprevention at
the tumor-promoting stage in lymphoma high-risk groups and for
treatment of diverse inflammatory diseases.

Discussion
Dysregulation in acetylation of histones and other proteins has
been linked to malignant transformation and other diseases (15).

Figure 5. EGCG suppressed the TNFa-induced NF-nB–dependent inflammatory response. A, EGCG dose dependently inhibited TNFa-induced NF-nB–dependent
promoter activity in HEK293 cells. HEK293 cells were transfected with a NF-nB–binding site-driven luciferase reporter plasmid and treated with TNF and/or various
concentrations of EGCG. Whole-cell extracts were used in luciferase assay. Results are presented as the means of two independent experiments performed in triplicate.
B, EGCG reduced mRNA levels of these target genes. Total RNA was prepared from each sample and used for quantitative RT-PCR to measure the expression of
the NF-nB target genes. As controls, the level of GAPDH mRNA was also measured by quantitative RT-PCR using the same batch of RNA samples. C, EGCG treatment
of cells resulted in a significant inhibition of the TNFa-induced IL-6 production. The release of IL-6 into the HEK293 cell culture medium was analyzed with an ELISA kit.
D, EGCG inhibits the production of TNFa-induced inflammatory molecules in vivo . Male BALB/c mice were pretreated with the indicated doses of EGCG by oral
administration for 4 wk, and then all were treated with TNFa as indicated. After 2 h, mice were killed, and serum was collected for serum IL-6 levels. A one-way ANOVA
test was used to determine the effects of the treatment. Columns, mean (n = 8); bars, SD. *, P < 0.05 versus control; #, P < 0.05 versus TNFa treated.

Figure 6. EGCG suppresses EBV-induced B lymphocyte transformation via inhibition of p65 acetylation. A, EGCG inhibited the EBV-mediated B-cell transformation
by blocking acetylation of p65. The level of p65 acetylation was measured by Western blot analysis of the EBV-associated Burkitt’s lymphoma cell lines in the presence
or absence of EGCG. B, the effect of EGCG on the production of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-12 in EBV-positive cells was assessed by real-time
PCR analysis. C, EGCG reversed the elevated cytokine expression profile in the EBV-positive B cells. Human Cytokine Antibody Array 3.0 membranes were incubated
with conditioned medium from EBV-positive B cells untreated or treated with EGCG. Images were visualized using LAS 3000 image analyzer. D, EGCG inhibited the
EBV-mediated B-cell transformation by blocking acetylation of p65. The outgrowth of proliferating B cells was examined by proliferation assay. Human PBMCs
were incubated in the presence or absence of EBV virus obtained from induced B95.8 cells. After 3 wk of incubation, the wells were examined for the outgrowth of
proliferating B cells by using phase-contrast microscopy.

interact with HDAC3, which is crucial for the deacetylation of p65.
We thus investigated our hypothesis that the balance between
HDAC and HAT activity determines the level of p65 acetylation and
subsequent expression of NF-nB–regulated genes. ChIP analysis
showed that addition of EGCG resulted in increased association of
HDAC3 with and dissociation of p300 from the NF-nB–binding site
within the IL-6 gene promoter, which shows the importance of the
HAT/HDAC balance in NF-nB–mediated inflammatory signaling.
The importance of exchange between acetylation and deacetylation
has been emphasized in the functional control of several proteins.
The acetylation of the androgen receptor (AR) is also a key
posttranslational modification regulating growth control in human
prostate cancer cells. Like p65, AR is also acetylated by p300 and
PCAF/TIP60, and acetylation of AR regulates the recruitment of
coregulators to the basal transcriptional machinery of AR target
genes (37). The balance between corepressors and coactivators
determines the levels of histone and AR acetylation and subsequent
transcription (31). Thus, our study provides firm evidence to

including HDAC, SIRT, and HMTase. EGCG also reversed the
acetylation of histone H3 and H4 by p300/CBP on the chromatin,
showing that EGCG is a novel anti-HATi. The p65 acetylation has
been shown to play a critical role in NF-nB–dependent activation.
Although EGCG has been shown to suppress the inflammatory
response through inhibition of NF-nB activation, there has been no
evidence whether EGCG directly suppresses p300/CBP-mediated
p65 acetylation and subsequent NF-nB activation. In vitro and
in vivo acetylation assays with p65 as a substrate clearly showed
that EGCG abrogated the p300-induced p65 acetylation. In
addition, EGCG increased the level of cytosolic InBa even in the
presence of TNFa. Thus, our study provides firm evidence that
EGCG suppresses p300/CBP-mediated p65 acetylation.
Another important result of this study is that EGCG reduced the
binding of p300 to the promoter region of IL-6 gene with an
increased recruitment of HDAC3, which highlights the importance
of the balance between HATs and HDACs in the NF-nB–mediated
inflammatory signaling pathway. NF-nB has also been shown to

failed to detect the inhibitory effect of EGCG on protein kinases
involved in p65 phosphorylation, including protein kinase A, protein
kinase C, CK2, and glycogen synthase kinase 3h (data not shown).
Based on these results, the mechanism of anti-NF-nB activation by
EGCG is closely related to the inhibition of p65 acetylation rather
than the direct inhibition of p65 phosphorylation.
In conclusion, we have provided evidence that EGCG, a HATi,
inhibits p65 acetylation-dependent NF-nB activation and suppresses the tumor-promoting stage in lymphoma. Similar to the
use of HDAC inhibitors, the disruption of histones and nonhistone
protein acetylation can be exploited to develop new anticancer
drugs. It seems contradictory to find both HAT and HDAC
inhibitors because these enzymes have opposing catalytic actions.
However, the molecular basis of HATs and HDACs is complex and
still being elucidated, and the molecular mechanisms of reversible
acetylation in cancer development are not likely to be simple. Until
now, dysfunction of HATs has been found to be associated with
several diseases, such as cardiac hypertrophy, asthma, and cancer.
In all of these diseases, the cellular histone and nonhistone
proteins are hyperacetylated. Therefore, the work described here
has shown that selective and signaling-dependent interferences of
protein acetylation by HATi, like that of EGCG, will be useful
pharmacologic tools to enhance our understanding of acetylation
events in cellular function and may lead to a new class of
therapeutic or chemopreventive drugs.

support the hypothesis that HAT coactivators compete with HDAC
corepressors for binding to promoter regions and/or protein
substrates and determine the level of transcription.
Chronic inflammation is linked to carcinogenesis in several organ
systems (33, 34). Our findings in this study imply that EGCG can
mediate a host defense system against environmental pathogens.
EGCG inhibited p65 acetylation and overexpression of NF-nB
target genes induced by EBV viral proteins implicated in B-cell
transformation and the development of EBV-associated malignancies. EBV is a lymphotropic virus associated with a variety of
human malignancies, including Burkitt’s lymphoma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome–
associated lymphomas (38). EBV reverse genetic analyses in the
context of primary B lymphocyte transformation indicate that the
latent viral proteins EBNA2, EBNA3A, EBNA3C, and LMP1 have
effects on cell growth regulation and are required for EBV latent
infection and B-cell transformation (39, 40). In particular, LMP1
constitutively activates NF-nB signaling pathways, and NF-nB
activation up-regulates antiapoptotic genes, such as A20, Bfl-1,
and BCL-2, which contribute to B-cell transformation (41, 42). As
NF-nB activation is one of the critical events during EBV-induced Bcell transformation, the inhibition of NF-nB activation could be a
potential target for the prevention of EBV-associated malignancies.
Importantly, we found that EBV-induced B-cell outgrowth was
dramatically inhibited by treatment with EGCG, supporting the
important role of acetylation in cancer initiation and progression.
EGCG is known to have anti-NF-nB activation activity in sepsis
and autoimmune encephalomyelitis as well as in specific cell types,
such as vascular smooth muscle cells, and various cancer cell types
(43–45). However, it remains unclear how EGCG suppresses NFnB–dependent signaling. EGCG was recently shown to inhibit
cigarette smoke condensate–induced p65 phosphorylation in
normal human bronchial epithelial cells (46). EGCG also seems
to indirectly inhibit InB kinase activity in epithelial cells (47). Thus,
these results raise the possibility that EGCG directly or indirectly
inhibits the activities of protein kinases involved in p65
phosphorylation. However, EGCG already has been reported to
be a nonspecific inhibitor of various kinases involved in
the phosphorylation of p65, with the exception of two protein
kinases: tyrosine-phosphorylated and regulated kinase 1A and p38regulated/activated kinase (48). Consistent with this result, we also
