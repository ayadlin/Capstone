Abstract
MDM2 negatively regulates p53 stability and many human tumors overproduce MDM2 as a mechanism to
restrict p53 function. Thus, inhibitors of p53-MDM2 binding that can reactivate p53 in cancer cells may offer an
effective approach for cancer therapy. RG7112 is a potent and selective member of the nutlin family of MDM2
antagonists currently in phase I clinical studies. RG7112 binds MDM2 with high afﬁnity (KD  11 nmol/L),
blocking its interactions with p53 in vitro. A crystal structure of the RG7112–MDM2 complex revealed that the
small molecule binds in the p53 pocket of MDM2, mimicking the interactions of critical p53 amino acid residues.
Treatment of cancer cells expressing wild-type p53 with RG7112 activated the p53 pathway, leading to cell-cycle
arrest and apoptosis. RG7112 showed potent antitumor activity against a panel of solid tumor cell lines. However,
its apoptotic activity varied widely with the best response observed in osteosarcoma cells with MDM2 gene
ampliﬁcation. Interestingly, inhibition of caspase activity did not change the kinetics of p53-induced cell death.
Oral administration of RG7112 to human xenograft-bearing mice at nontoxic concentrations caused dosedependent changes in proliferation/apoptosis biomarkers as well as tumor inhibition and regression. Notably,
RG7112 was highly synergistic with androgen deprivation in LNCaP xenograft tumors. Our ﬁndings offer a
preclinical proof-of-concept that RG7112 is effective in treatment of solid tumors expressing wild-type p53.

Introduction
The tumor suppressor p53 plays a pivotal role in protection
from cancer development. It is a transcription factor, which is
activated following stress and regulates multiple downstream
genes implicated in cell-cycle control, apoptosis, DNA repair,
and senescence (1, 2). In nonstressed cells, the level of p53 is
controlled by MDM2 through a negative feedback loop (3, 4).
When nuclear p53 level is elevated, it activates the transcription of the MDM2 gene. In turn, MDM2 protein binds to p53 and
blocks its transactivation domain (5). MDM2 is also a p53speciﬁc E3 ubiquitin ligase that targets p53 for ubiquitindependent degradation in the proteasome (6, 7). Both p53 and
MDM2 have short half-lives and their nuclear concentrations
are kept very low as a result of the functioning autoregulatory

circuit (8, 9). However, in cancer cells overexpressing MDM2,
this feedback loop is dysregulated (10). Stress-induced p53
activation mechanisms in these tumors are believed to be
inadequate, leading to inefﬁcient growth arrest and/or apoptosis (11). Therefore, blocking the p53-MDM2 interaction is
expected to overcome the oncogenic consequences of MDM2
overproduction and to restore p53 function (12, 13).
Genetic and biochemical studies mapped p53-MDM2 binding sites to the N-terminal domain of MDM2 and the Nterminal part of the transactivation domain of p53 (5). The
crystal structure of a p53-derived peptide bound to the p53binding domain of MDM2 revealed the existence of a relatively
deep cavity on the surface of the MDM2 molecule (14). More
importantly, only 3 amino acid residues from the p53 peptide
(Phe19, Trp23, and Leu26) seemed to play a critical role in the
binding between the 2 proteins by projecting residues deep
into the hydrophobic cavity of the p53 pocket (14). These
structural features of the p53–MDM2 complex suggested an
increased likelihood of identifying small molecules that might
interfere successfully with the protein–protein binding by
mimicking the key amino acid contacts between the 2 proteins.
A class of imidazoline compounds has been identiﬁed as
potent and selective inhibitors of the p53–MDM2 interaction
(15). These molecules, termed nutlins, interact speciﬁcally
with the p53-binding pocket of MDM2 and thus free p53
from negative control. Treatment of cancer cells expressing

wild-type p53 with nutlins stabilizes p53 and activates the p53
pathway leading to activation of p53 target genes, cell-cycle
arrest, and apoptosis (16). Although nutlins have shown good
cellular activity and allowed to derive the mechanistic proof-ofconcept for targeting p53–MDM2 interaction for cancer
therapy, their pharmacologic properties were inadequate for
clinical development. Here, we describe a potent and selective
new member of the nutlin family of MDM2 antagonists,
RG7112, which has been optimized for clinical use. It binds
selectively to the p53 pocket on the surface of the MDM2 in
vitro with high afﬁnity, blocks p53–MDM2 binding, leading to
stabilization and accumulation of p53 protein and activation of
the p53 pathway. The compound has good oral bioavailability
and has shown strong tumor growth inhibition and regression
in mouse xenograft models of human cancer supporting its
development for cancer therapy.

Materials and Methods
Cells, reagents, and assays
Cell lines were maintained in the recommended media
supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS (Invitrogen) and
2 mmol/L L-glutamine (Invitrogen). For some cell lines, modiﬁcations were made to standard growth media. MDA-MB-435
cells were maintained in media supplemented with 1 mmol/L
sodium pyruvate. Unless otherwise indicated, all media were
supplied by Invitrogen. MDA-MB-435 cells were provided by
Dr. Patricia Steeg from the National Cancer Institute
(Bethesda, MD) upon permission of Dr. Janet Price (MD
Anderson Cancer Center, University of Texas, Houston, TX).
The 22Rv1 cell line was kindly provided by Dr. James W.
Jacobberger (Case Western University, Cleveland, OH). MHM
cells were derived from an osteosarcoma with ampliﬁed MDM2
gene and kindly provided by Dr. Ola Myklebost (Radium
Hospital, Oslo, Norway). All other cell lines were obtained
from the American Type Culture Collection.
Recombinant human GST-MDM2 was cloned, expressed,
and puriﬁed at Roche. Phycolink goat anti-GST (type 1) allophycocyanin was purchased from Prozyme and Eu-8044-streptavidin was purchased from Perkin Elmer. Biotinylated MDM2
substrate peptide (Biotin-Aca-Met-Pro-Arg-Phe-Met-Asp-TyrTrp-Glu-Gly-Leu-Asn-NH2) was synthesized at Roche using
standard methods. All chemicals were purchased from Sigma
unless indicated otherwise.
The test compound [(4S,5R)-2-(4-tert-Butyl-2-ethoxy-phenyl)-4,5-bis-(4-chloro-phenyl)-4,5-dimethyl-4,5-dihydro-imidazol-1-yl]-[4-(3-methanesulfonyl-propyl)-piperazin-1-yl]methanone was synthesized at Hoffmann-La Roche. To
prepare stock solutions, compounds were dissolved at 10
mmol/L in 100% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and stored at
20 C.
Homogeneous time-resolved ﬂuorescence (HTRF) assay
measures the signal generated by 2 components when they
are in close proximity. The p53–MDM2 binding assay uses a
biotinylated peptide derived from the MDM2-binding domain
of p53 and a truncated N-terminal portion of recombinant
human GST-tagged MDM2 protein containing the p53-binding
domain. Proteins for crystal structure studies were expressed
in E. coli strain BL21 using the helper plasmid pUBS 520 coding

for the lacIq repressor and the rare tRNAArg [AGA/AGG]. For
crystallization, the frozen protein was thawed and concentrated to 9.8 mg/mL using a Centricon concentrator (3,000 MW
cutoff). The complex was then formed by combining the
protein with a slight molar excess of the inhibitor (stock
solution is 100 mmol/L in DMSO) and this solution was
allowed to sit for 4 hours at 4 C. Cryopreserved crystals were
used to collect diffraction data on beamline X8C at the National
Synchrotron Light Source at Brookhaven National Laboratory
(Upton, NY).
Cell proliferation/viability was evaluated by the tetrazolium
dye (MTT) assay. Cell growth kinetics were measured using the
IncuCyte live cell imaging system (Essen BioScience, Inc.). For
cell-cycle analysis, cells were cultured in T75 ﬂask with appropriate growth medium (106 cells/condition in 10 mL) and
incubated overnight at 37 C. They were incubated with test
compounds and processed as previously described (16). Apoptosis was determined using the Annexin V assay using the
GuavaNexin apoptosis detection kit (Guava Technologies) and
percent apoptosis determined by using a Guava Personal Cell
Analyzer following the manufacturer's protocol.
Animal studies
For SJSA-1, SJSA-1luc2, and MHM xenograft studies,
female Balb/c nude (CAnN.Cg-Foxn1nu/Crl, Charles River
Laboratories; Wilmington, DE) mice were implanted subcutaneously in the right ﬂank with 5  106 cells suspended in a
0.2 mL volume of a 1:1 mixture of Matrigel:PBS. For studies
with hormone-dependent LNCaP xenografts, castrated male
Balb/c nude (CAnN.Cg-Foxn1nu/Crl, Charles River Laboratories) were implanted with 12.5 mg sustained-release testosterone pellets (Innovative Research of America) 5 days
before subcutaneous inoculation with 1  107 cells suspended in 0.2 mL of Matrigel:PBS. Mice were randomized
into treatment groups (n ¼ 10 per group) when mean tumor
volume reached approximately 150 to 400 mm3. In all
studies, mice received either vehicle (1% Klucel LF/0.1%
Tween 80) or RG7112, administered as an oral suspension
at the dose indicated (25–200 mg/kg). For assessment of
androgen ablation treatment in combination with RG7112 in
LNCaP xenograft-bearing mice, testosterone pellets were
removed under ketamine/xylazine anesthesia. Tumor volume was monitored by caliper measurement and body
weights were recorded 2 to 3 times weekly. Tumor volume
(in mm3) was calculated as described previously (17).
For Western blot analysis, mice bearing established SJSA-1
subcutaneous xenografts received a single oral dose of vehicle
or 50, 100, or 200 mg/kg RG7112, and tumors were harvested at
4 and 8 hours after dosing. Protein was extracted from tumor
tissue with 1 radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (Sigma
Aldrich) containing protease inhibitors (Roche Diagnostics) by
homogenization. Equal amounts of total protein were resolved
on 4% to 12% NuPAGE gradient gel (Invitrogen) and blotted
with antibody dilutions as recommended by manufacturer.
The chemiluminescent signal was generated with enhanced
chemiluminescence Plus (GE Healthcare) and detected with
Fujiﬁlm LAS-3000 imager. The densitometric quantitation of
speciﬁc bands was determined using Multi Gauge Software

Results
RG7112 is a potent inhibitor of p53-MDM2 binding
Nutlins (15) represented the starting point for a lead optimization effort that culminated in the selection of RG7112 as a
clinical lead. This compound is a more potent binder to MDM2
than the original nutlins (15, 16). In the cell-free p53-MDM2
binding assay, RG7112 was able to displace a p53 peptide from

www.aacrjournals.org

the surface of MDM2 with an IC50 of 18  11 nmol/L (Fig. 1A).
This is approximately 4-fold higher potency than nutlin-3a (15).
Consistent with previous ﬁndings for nutlin-3 (15), the inactive
enantiomer of RG7112 was approximately 200-fold less potent
in the binding assay (data not shown). Supporting the results
from the p53-MDM2 binding assay, Biacore experiments
showed that RG7112 binds to MDM2 with an equilibrium KD
of 10.7 nmol/L (Fig. 1B). This improvement in binding as
compared with nutlin-3a results from the combined effect of
a faster on-rate and a slower off-rate (Supplementary Fig. S1).

imidazoline ring in any signiﬁcant way. This is consistent with
the observation that the additional rigidity has not sacriﬁced
binding.

Similarly to nutlin-3a, RG7112 is a speciﬁc MDM2 inhibitor and
practically inactive against MDMX (data not shown). In addition to the enhanced binding properties, RG7112 exhibited
signiﬁcant improvements in pharmacologic properties. The
4,5-dimethyl substitution (Fig. 1A) imparts greater structural
rigidity to the imidazoline scaffold and blocks metabolic
conversion to the inactive imidazole form (manuscript in
preparation).
A crystal structure of RG7112 with MDM2 (Fig. 1C) revealed
that the small molecule binds in the same fashion to the p53
pocket as was ﬁrst described for nutlin-2 (15). The 2 chlorophenyl rings occupy the Trp23 and Leu26 pockets, whereas the
ethoxy group projects into the Phe19 pocket. An overlay of the
RG7112 structure with that of nutlin-2 (Supplementary Fig. S2)
shows that the dimethyl substitution has not distorted the

Treatment of cultured cancer cells with RG7112 led to

changes were due to transcriptional activation as revealed by
the dose-dependent induction of their mRNA as well as that of

signaling in cancer cells
expressing wild-type p53. A,
RG7112 dose dependently
accumulates p53 protein and its
targets, MDM2 and p21 in SJSA1
osteosarcoma cells. Protein levels
were analyzed by Western blotting
24 hours after addition of RG7112
to exponentially growing cells.
B, RG7112 activates p53 target
genes in cells with wild-type but
not mutant p53. Two cancer cell
lines expressing wild-type p53
(MCF7 and HCT116) and 2 mutant
p53 lines (SW480 and MDAMB-435) were incubated with
increasing RG7112
concentrations for 24 hours and
the mRNA of 3 p53-target genes
(p21, MDM2, and MIC-1) were
determined by quantitative PCR
and expressed as fold-change
from DMSO controls. C, RG7112
inhibits the growth and kills SJSA1
osteosarcoma cells in a dosedependent manner. Exponentially
growing cells were incubated with
indicated concentration of
RG7112 or DMSO vehicle and
kinetics of cell growth was
measured by continuous timelapse cell imaging using the
IncuCyte instrument. D, RG7112
cytotoxicity depends on the p53
status of cancer cells. Three wildtype p53 (HCT116, RKO, and
SJSA1) and 2 mutant p53 (SW480
and MDA-MB-435) exponentially
growing cancer cell lines were
incubated with RG7112 for 5 days
and cell viability was measured by
the MTT assay. E, cancer cells
expressing wild-type p53 are more
sensitive to cytotoxic effect of
RG7112. RG7112 activity was
tested on a panel of 19 cancer cells

MDM2 Antagonists RG7112

enantiomer of RG7112 does not affect cellular p53 level (data
not shown). Activation of p53 was not due to genotoxic
mechanism induced by RG7112, as no change in the phosphorylation status of Ser15 on p53 protein was detected upon
treatment of cancer cells with 10 mmol/L RG7112 for 24 hours
(Supplementary Fig S3). No changes in the mRNA levels of all 3
p53 targets were detected in cancer cells expressing mutant
p53, which is unable to bind DNA and therefore inactive as a
transcription factor (Fig. 2B).
RG7112 dose dependently inhibited the growth and killed
SJSA1 osteosarcoma cells expressing high-levels of MDM2
protein due to MDM2 gene ampliﬁcation (Fig. 2C). The onset
of cell death was relatively slow with visual signs of adhesion
loss 15 to 20 hours after addition of RG7112 at concentrations
greater than 1 µmol/L. As expected from the mechanism of
action, growth suppressive and cytotoxic effect of RG7112 was
clearly dependent on the p53 status of cancer cells. In the 5 cell
line panel (3 wild-type and 2 mutant p53 lines) used routinely
for screening, there was more than 10-fold difference in
sensitivity (Fig. 2D). This difference was conﬁrmed when
RG7112 was tested on an additional 12 wild-type and 7 mutant
p53 cell lines (Fig. 2E). RG7112 inhibited the proliferation of 15
of 15 cancer cell lines expressing wild-type p53 (IC50 range:
0.18–2.2 mmol/L), but to a much lesser extent inhibited 7
cancer cell lines with p53 mutation (EC50 range: 5.7–20.3
mmol/L; Supplementary Table S1). The overall selectivity
between the panels of 7 mutant and 15 wild-type p53 lines,
expressed as fold difference in the average IC50 values, was 14fold. RG7112 showed similar margin of selectivity between the
HCT116 cancer cell line and its p53-null clone HCT115R1
(Supplementary Fig. S4).
RG7112 effectively activates p53 functions in cancer cells
Cell-cycle arrest is one of the main cellular functions of
activated p53. The tumor suppressor effectively arrests cellcycle progression in G1 and G2 phases primarily attributed to
induction of the p53 transcriptional target and pan-cyclin–
dependent kinase inhibitor, p21 (19, 20). Treatment of exponentially proliferating cancer cells (HCT116 and SJSA1) with
RG7112 for 24 hours induced a dose-dependent cell-cycle block
in G1 and G2–M phase and depletion of the S-phase compartment (Fig. 3A). In the MDM2-overexpressing osteosarcoma cell
line, SJSA1, the cell-cycle arrest was followed by induction of
apoptosis as revealed by the Annexin V assay (Fig. 3B). As
shown previously with nutlin-3a, (16) the cell-cycle arrest
function was activated in all tested solid tumor cell lines of
epithelial origin (data not shown) but its apoptotic activity
varied widely in the 12 cancer cell line panels (Fig. 3C). The 2
osteosarcoma cell lines with MDM2 gene ampliﬁcation exhibited the highest sensitivity and the majority of the cell population underwent apoptotic cell death. The sensitivity of the
rest ranged from very good (LNcaP) to poor (U2OS). Practically,
half of the cell lines in the panel were unable to undergo
apoptosis in the presence of high RG7112 concentration,
similar to results with nutlin-3a (16). As previously shown
(16, 21), this resistance to apoptotic activity of the MDM2
antagonists was not due to inability to stabilize p53 or induce
its target genes.

www.aacrjournals.org

Although both cell-cycle arrest and apoptotic function of
p53 depend on its transcriptional activity, they are executed via
different downstream pathways and may require different
threshold levels of p53 protein. To test this hypothesis, we
determined the RG7112 concentration required for achieving
50% of the maximum cell-cycle arrest or apoptosis in the
sensitive osteosarcoma cell line, SJSA1. To this end, we used
a range of drug concentrations allowing to reach less than 1%
S-phase fraction for cell-cycle arrest after 24 hours or a plateau
effect for Annexin V positivity after 48 hours incubation with
RG7112. EC50 for cell-cycle arrest (0.4 mmol/L) was found to be
lower than EC50 for apoptosis (1 mmol/L) by 2.5-fold (Fig. 3D).
Caspase inhibition does not affect the onset of RG7112induced cell death
Caspase deﬁciency is a frequent event in cancer and may
affect tumor response to apoptosis-inducing therapies including MDM2 antagonists. Therefore, we asked how the loss of
caspase activity would affect the response to RG7112. To this
end, we used a highly sensitive cancer cell line, SJSA1, and
RG7112 concentration capable of inducing robust apoptosis in
the presence or absence of the potent pan-caspase inhibitor, ZVAD-FMK. After 48-hour incubation, RG7112 induced high
levels of Annexin V indicative of massive cell death that was
reduced substantially by pretreatment with Z-VAD (Fig. 4A).
However, cell death kinetics measured by the percentage of
viable cells remained unchanged (Fig. 4B). The levels of p53 and
its targets, p21 and MDM2, were also similar in the presence or
absence of caspase inhibitor (Fig. 4C). Then, we followed cell
morphology over several days in the presence or absence of ZVAD-FMK. RG7112 treatment caused clear apoptotic phenotype with nuclear fragmentation and chromatin condensation
after 48 hours (Fig. 4D, left). However, in the presence of
caspase inhibitor, the dead SJSA1 cells preserved their intact
nuclear morphology for several days (Fig. 4D, right). Thus,
caspase inhibition turned RG7112-induced apoptotic death
into a necrotic-like death. This phenomenon was not limited to
RG7112 but was also observed with nutlin-3a (data not shown)
suggesting that MDM2 antagonists do not require caspase
activity for effective cell killing.
RG7112 activates p53 pathway and induces apoptosis in
tumor cells in vivo
Pharmocodynamic effects of RG7112 were assessed in the
SJSA1 xenograft model. Disruption of p53-MDM2 binding by
RG7112 led to stabilization of p53, activation of the pathway,
and elevation of p53 target genes such as p21 and MDM2 in
vitro (Fig. 2). To assess the ability of RG7112 to activate p53
response in vivo, SJSA1 tumor-bearing mice were treated with a
single dose of vehicle or 50 to 200 mg/kg RG7112 for 4 to 24
hours (Fig. 5A). Western blot analysis showed a dose-dependent increase in p53 protein and its targets, p21 and MDM2.
The p53 protein levels were highest at 4 hours after dose and
continue to persist at 24 hours at the highest dose level (200
mg/kg), whereas the duration of p53 modulation was shorter at
lower dose levels.
Activation of p53 in SJSA1 cells showed effective cell-cycle
arrest, followed by apoptosis in vitro (Fig. 3). In vivo, we

Figure 3. RG7112 induces cellcycle arrest and apoptosis in
cancer cells. A, RG7112 arrests
cancer cells with wild-type p53 in
G1 and G2 phases. Log-phase
cancer cells were incubated with
RG7112 or DMSO for 24 hours and
their cell-cycle distribution was
determined by BrdUrd labeling and
cell-cycle analysis. B, RG7112
induces apoptosis in
osteosarcoma cells with mdm2
gene ampliﬁcation. Exponentially
proliferating cells were exposed to
RG7112 for 48 hours and the
fraction of Annexin-positive cells
was determined by the Nexin
assay. C, apoptotic activity of
RG7112 varies among solid tumor
cells. A panel of 11 solid tumor
derived cancer cell lines were
incubated with 7 mmol/L RG7112
for 48 hours and apoptotic activity
was measured by the Annexin V
assay. D, lower RG7112 levels are
required for cell-cycle arrest
versus apoptosis. Exponentially
growing SJSA1 osteosarcoma
cells were incubated with a range
of RG7112 concentrations and the
IC50 for reaching maximum cellcycle inhibition (depletion of Sphase compartment) and
apoptosis (Annexin V positivity)
were determined as in A and B.

(BrdUrd) incorporation. SJSA1 tumor-bearing animals were
treated with a single dose of vehicle or 50 to 200 mg/kg RG7112
for 8 to 24 hours, and BrdUrd was administered 2 hours before
tumor collection. Immunohistochemical detection of BrdUrd
incorporation indicated a statistically signiﬁcant and dosedependent decrease in proliferating cells at 16 and 24 hours
postdosing with RG7112 as compared with vehicle controls
(Fig. 5B.). At the highest dose level of RG7112 (200 mg/kg), only
1.2% ( 0.89 SD) of cells incorporated BrdUrd at 24 hours
postdosing versus 14% ( 1.83 SD) of vehicle treated tumors,
suggesting that RG7112 effectively arrests DNA replication and
tumor cell proliferation.
p53-Dependent apoptosis typically involves proteolytic activation of caspase-3 and 7, which in turn cleave substrates
containing a short DEVD amino acid sequence. Presence of
activated caspases 3 and 7 are viewed as "early" markers of
apoptosis, as they can be detected before plasma membrane

blebbing and DNA fragmentation. To evaluate the ability of
RG7112 to elicit apoptosis in vivo, bioluminescent detection of
activated caspases 3/7 was monitored in SJSA1-luc2 tumorbearing mice using Z-DEVD-aminoluciferin as a substrate for
activated caspases 3 and 7. When the DEVD peptide sequence
is cleaved by activated caspases, aminoluciferin is liberated
and can then serve as a substrate for luciferase enzyme
produced by SJSA1-luc2 cells. Luminescent signal is thereby
emitted only in apoptotic cells. Representative bioluminescent
images from mice bearing vehicle and RG7112-treated tumors
are shown in Fig. 5C (left). Tumors from mice treated with a
single dose of 100 or 200 mg/kg RG7112 produced a statistically
signiﬁcant time-dependent induction in luciferase signal as
compared with vehicle controls, indicating that apoptosis was
occurring within the tumors (Fig. 5C, right).
PARP is a caspase-3 substrate whose cleavage product is
observed during apoptotic cell death (cPARP). Immunohistochemical detection of cPARP was conducted in SJSA1

pronounced tumor regression with practically no palpable
tumors left at the end of the 2-week treatment period (Fig.
6C). Kaplan–Meier survival analysis showed that each monotherapy substantially increased mouse lifespan (76% for
RG7112; 174% for androgen withdrawal; Fig. 6D). However,
the increase of lifespan (ILS) by the combination was more
than 800%, indicating that most mice died from natural
causes.

Discussion
The data reported here show that RG7112 is a potent
and selective antagonist of the p53–MDM2 interaction that
effectively activates the p53 pathway and induces cell-cycle
arrest and/or apoptosis in cell lines expressing wild-type p53
and representing a variety of solid tumor types. In cell-free
assays, RG7112 binds to MDM2 protein with high afﬁnity
(KD  11 nmol/L) and inhibits MDM2-p53 binding with
IC50  20 nmol/L. Exposure of cultured cancer cells to the
compound leads to a dose-dependent accumulation of p53
protein and activation of its transcriptional targets and the
p53 pathway. As a result, cancer cells undergo a cell-cycle
block in G1 and G2 phase followed by apoptosis.

RG7112 was most effective in killing cancer cells overproducing MDM2 protein as a result of MDM2 gene ampliﬁcation
(e.g., SJSA1 and MHM osteosarcoma; Fig. 3B and C). However,
despite its substantially increased potency, RG7112 was unable
to induce effective cell death in more than half of the 12 solid
tumor cell panels (Fig. 3C). As previously shown for nutlin-3a
(16), this was not due to inability to stabilize p53 and activate
its transcriptional targets and cell-cycle arrest function but
likely to defective downstream p53 apoptotic signaling. The
high sensitivity of MDM2-ampliﬁed tumors is likely due to
the fact that these tumors are free of other defects in the
p53 pathway and inhibition of MDM2 restores their full
p53-dependent apoptotic potential.
Inhibition of cell-cycle progression is a major function of
activated p53 and usually precedes induction of apoptosis
(16, 22). Our data suggest that the cell-cycle in MDM2-ampliﬁed SJSA1 osteosarcoma cells can be blocked at lower RG7112
levels. The EC50 for cell-cycle arrest was 2.5-fold lower than
EC50 for apoptosis (Fig. 3D). This difference in threshold levels
may favor cell-cycle arrest over apoptosis. This is expected
because cell-cycle arrest is one of the primary functions of p53
evolved to protect cells from propagation of damaged DNA

before it is repaired, whereas apoptosis is thought as the
ultimate step for elimination of cells with unrepairable damage. We have shown previously that cell-cycle arrest by nongenotoxic p53 activation in SJSA1 and other cancer cell lines
does not affect the ability of cancer cells to undergo apoptosis
(17). The lower drug threshold for cell-cycle arrest may allow
for partially separating the 2 effects of activated p53 in the
clinical setting.
Another, interesting ﬁnding of this study is the independence of the onset of cell death on caspase activity (Fig. 4).
Although caspase inhibition shifted the morphology of dying
cells from typical apoptotic to a necrotic-like, it did not change
the magnitude and kinetics of cell death. The ability of RG7112
to induce "caspase-independent" cell death suggests that
alterations in caspase expression and activity, frequently found
in human cancer, may not affect the overall outcome of MDM2
antagonist therapy as long as p53 downstream signaling in
tumor cells is preserved.
Given orally to nude mice, RG7112 was able to penetrate
human xenografts, effectively inhibited their proliferation, and
induced apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. As observed in
vitro, cell-cycle arrest indicated by inhibition of BrdUrd incorporation preceded apoptosis induction, detected by both
PARP1 cleavage and caspase-3/7 activation (Fig. 5). Daily
administration of RG7112 to SJSA1 bearing nude mice for 3
weeks resulted in a dose-dependent suppression of tumor
growth and regression in the high-dose group (100 mg/kg/
day). Similar efﬁcacy was observed in the MHM osteosarcoma
model (Fig. 6) also expressing high levels of MDM2 protein (15).
These results conﬁrmed the in vitro observations that MDM2ampliﬁed tumors are highly sensitive to MDM2 antagonists,
which remove the major barrier to p53 functionality acquired
during cancer development. Therefore, MDM2-ampliﬁed status of patients with wild-type p53 tumors could be a useful
predictor of response to p53-activating therapy by MDM2
antagonists.
The high-genetic plasticity characteristic for human tumors,
especially at advanced stages, increases the chances for
acquired resistance to most single agent therapies including
MDM2 antagonists. Therefore, combination approaches to
cancer therapy are extensively sought. The p53 pathway is
central to cancer cell signaling, interacting with multiple
cellular pathways and offering opportunities for synthetic

lethal strategies. The highly synergistic combination of p53
activation by RG7112 and androgen deprivation in the androgen-dependent LNCaP mouse model (Fig. 6C and D) is one
example of these possibilities. Combination of RG7112 with
androgen withdrawal, the standard for ﬁrst-line prostate cancer therapy, led to a dramatic reduction of relatively large
xenografts to unpalpable tumors and practically cured most
mice.
The results presented in this article supported further
evaluation of RG7112 in the clinic. Recently completed clinical
biomarker studies in patients with liposarcoma have conﬁrmed the ability of RG7112 to activate p53 and its major
functions, cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis, in human tumors
(23). Upcoming data from several ongoing clinical investigations should help to answer the question whether nongenotoxic p53 activation by MDM2 antagonists can improve the
clinical outcomes for patients retaining wild-type p53 in their
tumors.
