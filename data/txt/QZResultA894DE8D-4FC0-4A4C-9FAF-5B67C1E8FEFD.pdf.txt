ABSTRACT:
Control of BRAF(V600E) metastatic melanoma by BRAF inhibitor (BRAF-I) is
limited by intrinsic and acquired resistance. Growth factor receptor up-regulation is
among the mechanisms underlying BRAF-I resistance of melanoma cells. Here we
demonstrate for the first time that PDGFRα up-regulation causes BRAF-I resistance.
PDGFRα inhibition by PDGFRα-specific short hairpin (sh)RNA and by PDGFRα inhibitors
restores and increases melanoma cells’ sensitivity to BRAF-I in vitro and in vivo. This
effect reflects the inhibition of ERK and AKT activation which is associated with BRAF-I
resistance of melanoma cells. PDGFRα up-regulation is mediated by Sonic Hedgehog
Homolog (Shh) pathway activation which is induced by BRAF-I treatment. Similarly
to PDGFRα inhibition, Shh inhibition by LDE225 restores and increases melanoma
cells’ sensitivity to BRAF-I. These effects are mediated by PDGFRα down-regulation
and by ERK and AKT inhibition. The clinical relevance of these data is indicated by
the association of PDGFRα up-regulation in melanoma matched biopsies of BRAF-I
+/- MEK inhibitor treated patients with shorter time to disease progression and
less tumor regression. These findings suggest that monitoring patients for early
PDGFRα up-regulation will facilitate the identification of those who may benefit from
the treatment with BRAF-I in combination with clinically approved PDGFRα or Shh
inhibitors.

INTRODUCTION

RESULTS

Over 50% of metastatic melanomas harbor the
BRAF(V600E) point mutation (T1799A)[1, 2]. Mutant
BRAF(V600E) represents a constitutively active protein
serine kinase that leads to the sustained activation of the
BRAF→MEK1/2→ERK1/2 MAP kinase pathway[3, 4].
This pathway plays a critical role in the regulation of
gene expression as well as cell proliferation and survival,
which are all involved in the initiation and progression of
melanoma[5, 6]. Clinical trials have demonstrated that the
BRAF inhibitor (BRAF-I), PLX4032 (vemurafenib), and
other inhibitors in its class (GSK2118436 or dabrafenib)
can induce tumor regression in more than 50% of
the patients with metastatic melanoma harboring the
BRAF(V600E) mutation and improve both progressionfree and overall survival [7, 8]. Although the clinical
activity of BRAF-I therapy is a major breakthrough
in the treatment of metastatic melanoma, the median
time to disease progression is less than 7 months due to
acquired resistance[8]. Furthermore complete responses
to vemurafenib are only observed in 5% of patients, as a
consequence of intrinsic BRAF-I resistance[7, 9].
The multiple mechanisms underlying melanoma
BRAF-I resistance, most of which have been validated
by clinical evidence[10-14], can be classified into two
groups. One includes ERK signaling reactivation, caused
by point mutations in MEK1[10, 15], amplification of
mutant BRAF(V600E)[16], elevated CRAF activity[17],
activating NRAS mutations [11], increased levels of
COT/Tpl2[12] and/or aberrantly spliced BRAF(V600E)
[13]. The other one includes activation of alternative protumorigenic pathways such as the PI3K/AKT pathway
that can be caused by phosphatase and tensin homolog
(PTEN) loss [18] or by an increase in signaling driven by
receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK). The latter include the
platelet-derived growth factor (PDGFR)β [11, 19] and the
insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF1R) [14]. To the
best of our knowledge, PDGFRα, a RTK which markedly
differs in its functional properties from its family member
PDGFRβ, has not been implicated in BRAF-I resistance of
BRAF(V600E) melanoma.
In this study we provide for the first time both in
vitro and in vivo evidence that PDGFRα up-regulation
causes BRAF-I resistance of BRAF(V600E) melanoma
cells. Furthermore, we show that PDGFRα up-regulation
is mediated by activation of the Sonic Hedgehog Homolog
(Shh) pathway which is induced by BRAF-I treatment.
Lastly, we describe combinatorial strategies which can be
easily translated to a clinical setting to counteract the Shh/
PDGFRα mediated BRAF-I resistance of BRAF(V600E)
melanoma cells.

ERK reactivation, AKT activation and PDGFRα
up-regulation in melanoma cell lines with
acquired BRAF-I resistance
The parental Colo38 and M21 cell lines were
compared in their sensitivity to the anti-proliferative
activity of the BRAF-I vemurafenib to the autologous
cell lines Colo38R, and M21R and the allogeneic cell line
TPF-10-741. Parental Colo38 and M21 cells were highly
sensitive to the anti-proliferative activity of vemurafenib
at the concentrations ranging between 250 nM and 2000
nM. In contrast, Colo38R and M21R cells showed a
markedly lower sensitivity to the growth inhibitory effects
of vemurafenib (Supplementary Figure 1). TPF-10-741
cells displayed an intermediate sensitivity to vemurafenib.
This acquired resistance model was used to investigate the
molecular mechanisms underlying disease progression
after an initial response to vemurafenib. Since acquired
BRAF-I resistance can be mediated by reactivation
of the MAPK pathway or by activation of alternative
pathways like PI3K/AKT, we evaluated signaling
through these pathways in both parental and resistant
cell lines (Figure 1A). Following a 1 and a 24 hour (h)
incubation at 37°C with vemurafenib, phospho- (p)-ERK
levels were markedly reduced in both Colo38 and M21
cells, but were changed to a limited extent or not at all in
Colo38R and M21R cells. The latter cells also displayed
much higher levels of p-ERK as compared to the parental
cells under basal conditions (P<0.05). As described by
Lito et al. in other BRAF(V600E) melanoma cell lines
[20], p-ERK levels rebounded after a 24 h incubation at
37°C with vemurafenib in both Colo38 and M21 cells.
However no changes were detected in Colo38R and
M21R cells. Similarly to the resistant cells, in partially
resistant TPF-10-741 cells p-ERK levels were changed
to a limited extent rebounding just at 24 h incubation
with vemurafenib. p-AKT levels were increased in
Colo38R and M21R cells compared to Colo38 and M21
cells (P<0.05). p-AKT levels were also increased in
Colo38, M21 and TPF-10-741 cells after treatment with
vemurafenib (P<0.05).
To investigate the mechanisms underlying the
melanoma cell resistance to BRAF-I, the expression and
activation of the RAF/MEK/ERK and PI3K/AKT pathway
components were analyzed in the cell lines both under
basal conditions and after treatment with vemurafenib.
CRAF and MEK were reactivated in Colo38R, M21R,
and TPF-10-741 cells. PI3K was activated in Colo38, M21
and TPF-10-741 cells after treatment with vemurafenib
(Figure 1B), but its levels were not affected in Colo38R
and M21R cells. PTEN was not detected in TPF-10-741
cells, but was expressed in the other cell lines (Figure 1B).

Therefore the resistance of melanoma cell lines to BRAF-I
was associated with the simultaneous reactivation of the
MAPK pathway and with the activation of the PI3K/
AKT pathway. The latter might be caused by an upstream
activator of MAPK and PI3K/AKT pathways. To exclude
the presence of NRAS mutations as well as the presence
of additional alterations in BRAF gene, a RT-PCR was
performed in parental and resistant cell lines. No changes
were detected in NRAS sequence and the BRAF(V600E)
mutation was present in both parental and resistant cell
lines (Supplementary Figure S2). Since BRAF-I resistance
through reactivation of MAPK pathway and activation
of PI3K/AKT pathway can be mediated by RTK up-

regulation [11], we investigated the potential role of RTK
PDGFRα, PDGFRβ and VEGFR2 in BRAF-I resistance.
As shown in Figure 1C, vemurafenib enhanced PDGFRα
expression and activation in Colo38 and M21 cells
(P<0.05). Furthermore PDGFRα levels were higher in
Colo38R and M21R cells as compared to the parental cells
(P<0.05). PDGFRα was expressed and activated in TPF10-741 cells both under basal conditions and following
treatment with vemurafenib. PDGFRβ was up-regulated
on TPF-10-741 cells after treatment with vemurafenib, but
was not detectable in the other cell lines both under basal
conditions and following treatment with vemurafenib.
Lastly, VEGFR2 expression was not detected in any cell

To test whether PDGFRα up-regulation caused
BRAF-I resistance in Colo38R, M21R and TPF-10-741
cells, PDGFRα was knocked down in the three cell lines
using 5 PDGFRα-specific short hairpin RNA (shRNAs).
As shown in Figure 2A, lentiviral transduction of M21R
cells with a PDGFRα-specific shRNA(#4) construct
knocked down p-PDGFRα and PDGFRα expression
(p<0.05). PDGFRα down-regulation was associated
with a minimal decrease in p-ERK and p-AKT levels
(P<0.05) as compared to untreated cells. However, this
effect was markedly enhanced when the cells transduced
with PDGFRα-specific shRNA(#4) were treated with
vemurafenib (P<0.05) which slightly decreased p-ERK
levels and increased p-AKT expression. Additionally,
as shown in Figure 2B, M21R and TPF-10-741 cells
transduced with the PDGFRα-specific shRNA(#4)
displayed a significantly increased sensitivity to the anti-

To assess the potential clinical significance of our
in vitro results, we tested PDGFRα expression in biopsies
obtained from 9 melanoma patients treated with BRAF-I
or with the novel combination of BRAF-I and MEK
inhibitor (MEK-I) [21]. Tumor biopsies were performed
pre-treatment (day 0), at 10-14 days on treatment, and/or
at the time of disease progression. Immunohistochemical
(IHC) staining demonstrated PDGFRα up-regulation in
5 out of 9 patients following treatment with BRAF-I +/MEK-I (Figure 3A). In 3 of the 5 patients a significant
increase in PDGFRα expression (>1+) was observed
after treatment. Patients with a significant (>1+) increase
in PDGFRα expression after treatment with BRAF-I +/MEK-I had less tumor regression (Figure 3B) and shorter

established the dose of the PDGFRα-I to be combined
with vemurafenib in the 5 cell lines. The IC50 doses of
sunitinib, imatinib and crenolanib were found to be 2, 15
and 1.5 µM, respectively (Supplementary Figure 3). In
line with the data in the literature [25-35], the doses of 1.5

induction of apoptosis. As shown in Figure 4A and
Supplementary Figure 4, vemurafenib and PDGFRα-I
combination inhibited the proliferation of Colo38 and
M21 cells to a significantly greater extent (P<0.05)
than each agent alone. Furthermore, as observed with
cells transduced with the PDGFRα-specific shRNA,
PDGFRα-I synergized (P<0.05) with vemurafenib in
the inhibition of Colo38R, M21R and TPF-10-741 cell
growth. Lastly, vemurafenib and PDGFRα-I (crenolanib
or sunitinib) combination (Figure 4B and Supplementary
Figure 5) induced apoptosis in a significantly (P<0.05)
higher percentage of cells than each agent alone in both
BRAF-I sensitive and resistant cell lines. It is worth noting

that crenolanib and sunitinib induced apoptosis in both
BRAF-I sensitive and resistant cell lines (P<0.05), while
vemurafenib had no detectable effect.

Enhancement by PDGFRα-I of the in vivo antitumor activity of BRAF-I in BRAF-I sensitive and
resistant BRAF(V600E) melanoma cell lines

p-AKT levels were markedly decreased in both BRAF-I
sensitive and resistant melanoma cells after treatment with
vemurafenib and PDGFRα-I combination. Specifically,
p-ERK levels were dramatically decreased in Colo38 and
M21 cells treated with vemurafenib. In contrast p-ERK
levels were minimally decreased in Colo38 and M21
cells treated with PDGFRα-I. In addition, p-AKT levels
were increased in M21 cells treated with vemurafenib,
but were reduced in Colo38 and M21 cells treated with
PDGFRα-I. However both p-ERK and p-AKT levels
were markedly inhibited in Colo38 and M21 cells treated
with vemurafenib and PDGFRα-I combination. On the
other hand, p-ERK levels were minimally inhibited by
vemurafenib in TPF-10-741 cells as well as in Colo38R
and M21R cells when compared with parental cell lines.
As observed with cells transduced with the PDGFRαspecific shRNA, PDGFRα-I decreased p-ERK and p-AKT
levels in Colo38R, M21R and TPF-10-741 cells. However,
vemurafenib and PDGFRα-I combination markedly
decreased both p-ERK and p-AKT levels to a greater
extent than each agent alone in all of the BRAF-I resistant
cell lines (Figure 5).

To assess the in vivo relevance of our in vitro results,
vemurafenib and sunitinib combination was tested for its
ability to inhibit the growth of M21 and M21R cells in
severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice. The oral
administration of the drugs, either in combination or as
individual agents, caused no overt side effects (data not
shown). In the mice grafted with M21 cells (Figure 6A)
vemurafenib (12.5 mg/kg twice per day) and sunitinib
(20 mg/Kg/day) combination inhibited tumor growth to
a significantly (P<0.001) greater extent than each single
agent. Both vemurafenib and sunitinib inhibited tumor
growth as single agents to a similar extent (P<0.001).
It is noteworthy that sunitinib was administered at a
lower dose (20 mg/Kg/day) as compared to the dose
used by other investigators (40 mg/Kg/day)[26, 27, 36].
Nevertheless, sunitinib was effective in enhancing the
anti-tumor activity of vemurafenib. Analysis of the tumor
cell lysates removed from treated and untreated mice
(Figure 6B) demonstrated that vemurafenib and sunitinib
combination markedly reduced both p-ERK and p-AKT
levels. Sunitinib by itself slightly decreased p-ERK and
p-AKT levels, while vemurafenib decreased p-ERK levels
but increased p-AKT levels. IHC analysis of the primary

sunitinib (1.5 µM) and/or imatinib (10 µM) and/or crenolanib (1 uM). Following an up to 72 h incubation at 37°C, cells were harvested and
lysed. Cell lysates were analyzed by western blot with the indicated mAbs. β-actin was used as a loading control. Representative results are
shown (upper panel). The levels of p-ERK and p-AKT normalized to β-actin are plotted and expressed as mean ± SD of the results obtained
in two independent experiments (lower panel).

tumors demonstrated a marked reduction in the number
of mitoses in tumors from mice treated with vemurafenib
and sunitinib combination (Figure 6C) when compared to
tumors from mice treated with each single agent (P<0.001)
or from untreated mice (P<0.001). Both vemurafenib and
sunitinib reduced significantly the number of mitoses in
tumors as compared to untreated mice (P<0.001). The
number of apoptotic cells (Figure 6D) in tumors from
mice treated with vemurafenib and sunitinib combination
was significantly higher than in tumors from untreated

mice or from mice treated with vemurafenib or sunitinib
individually (P<0.001). Sunitinib, but not vemurafenib
induced apoptosis in a significantly higher number of cells
in tumors when compared to untreated mice (P<0.001).
In the mice grafted with M21R cells (Figure 6E),
as expected, vemurafenib did not inhibit tumor growth
as compared to untreated mice. In contrast, sunitinib
significantly inhibited tumor growth as compared
to untreated mice (P<0.001) or to mice treated with
vemurafenib (P<0.001). This effect was significantly

cells grafted in immunodeficient mice. A, E. M21 and M21R cells were each implanted subcutaneously in 20 SCID mice. When

tumors became palpable, mice were randomly divided into 4 groups (5 mice/group). One group was treated with the BRAF-I vemurafenib
(12.5 mg/kg/twice per day), one with the PDGFRα-I sunitinib (20 mg/kg/day) and one with vemurafenib (12.5 mg/kg/twice per day) in
combination with sunitinib (20 mg/kg/day). One group of mice was left untreated as a reference for the natural course of the disease.

untreated and treated mice were lysed and analyzed for expression and activation of the indicated signaling pathway components. β-actin

enhanced when sunitinib was combined with vemurafenib
(P<0.001). Analysis of the tumor lysates (Figure 6F)
demonstrated that, while vemurafenib had no detectable
effect on p-ERK and p-AKT levels, sunitinib inhibited
both of them. This effect was more marked in tumors from
mice treated with vemurafenib and sunitinib combination.
IHC analysis of the primary tumors showed a significantly
lower number of mitoses in tumors from mice treated with
sunitinib (Figure 6G) when compared to that in tumors
from vemurafenib treated or untreated mice (P<0.001).
In addition, sunitinib strongly increased the number of
apoptotic cells in tumors as compared to vemurafenib
or untreated mice (P<0.001) (Figure 6H). However
vemurafenib and sunitinib combination decreased the
number of mitotic cells and increased that of apoptotic
cells to a significantly (P<0.001) greater extent than
sunitinib alone.

To prove that the results obtained with sunitinib
did not reflect potential off target effects of sunitinb we
tested the therapeutic efficacy of the other PDGFRα-I
imatinib in combination with a higher dose of vemurafenib
(25 mg/kg twice per day). Imatinib was administered at
a dose (100 mg/kg/day) which has been used by other
investigators [31, 32]. As expected vemurafenib and
imatinib combination inhibited tumor growth of M21
cells to a significantly (P<0.001) greater extent than each
single agent, although imatinib displayed lower anti-tumor
activity than sunitinib and vemurafenib had a higher antitumor effect. (Supplementary Figure 6).

Role of Shh pathway activation in PDGFRα
up-regulation mediated BRAF-I resistance of
melanoma cells

induced by PDGFRα up-regulation, since inhibition of its
synthesis by PDGFRα-specific shRNA causes a reduction
of ERK and AKT activation and restores sensitivity to
BRAF-I. A similar effect has been demonstrated for the
HGF mediated resistance to BRAF-I [47]. This conclusion
is corroborated by the in vitro and in vivo results obtained
by inhibiting the function of PDGFRα with the clinically
approved tyrosine kinase inhibitors sunitinib, imatinib
and crenolanib. Sunitinib is an inhibitor of PDGFRα,
PDGFRβ and VEGFR2. Imatinib is an inhibitor of
PDGFRα, PDGFRβ. Crenolanib is a novel and potent
inhibitor of PDGFRα and PDGFRβ. It is worth noting that
the BRAF(V600E) melanoma cell lines with a PDGFRα
up-regulation mediated BRAF-I resistance did not express
PDGFRβ and VEGFR2. Vemurafenib and PDGFRα-I
combination markedly inhibits in vitro proliferation and
induces apoptosis of melanoma cells with a PDGFRα
up-regulation mediated BRAF-I resistance. These results
are paralleled by our in vivo findings. Vemurafenib and
PDGFRα-I combination inhibited the growth and induced
apoptosis in human melanoma cells with PDGFRα upregulation mediated BRAF-I resistance engrafted in
immunodeficient mice. These effects are mediated by
the inhibition of the RAF/MEK/ERK and PI3K/AKT
signaling pathways. The levels of p-ERK and p-AKT were
markedly reduced in melanoma cells with PDGFRα upregulation mediated BRAF-I resistance following in vitro
or in vivo treatment with vemurafenib and PDGFRα-I
combination. It is noteworthy that this combination has
a significantly greater anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic
effect than either agent alone both in vitro and in vivo
also with BRAF-I sensitive human melanoma cells which
express PDGFRα. Therefore, our results suggest that the
combinatorial strategy we have designed may overcome
not only the acquired, but also the intrinsic BRAF-I
resistance if PDGFRα is expressed. Furthermore they
confirm that simultaneous inhibition of both the ERK and
AKT pathways is more effective in suppressing tumor cell
proliferation and in inducing apoptosis in both BRAF-I
sensitive and resistant melanoma cells[14, 48-54].
In agreement with the information in the literature
[37-40], we have found that PDGFRα up-regulation
associated with MAPK and PI3K/AKT activation is
regulated by the Shh pathway and by Gli1 activation. Our
data confirm this relationship since treatment with BRAF-I
enhances Gli1 expression. The latter results are associated
with PDGFRα up-regulation mediated BRAF-I resistance
since treatment with the novel clinically approved Shh-I
LDE225 down-regulates the expression of PDGFRα by
inhibiting Gli1 activation. Furthermore, PDGFRα downregulation by the Shh-I LDE225 in combination with
vemurafenib enhances tumor growth inhibition in vitro
and in vivo and decreases ERK and AKT activation in both
sensitive and resistant cell lines.
PDGFRα is not the only growth factor receptor
which plays a role in BRAF-I resistance. IGFR1[14] and

The previously described role of the Shh pathway
and Gli1 activation[37-40] in PDGFRα up-regulation
associated with the MAPK and PI3K/AKT pathway
activation prompted us to investigate whether Gli1
activation is involved in PDGFRα up-regulation in
BRAF(V600E) melanoma cells. As shown in Figure
7A, vemurafenib enhanced Gli1 expression in Colo38,
Colo38R, M21, M21R, and TPF-10-741 cells as compared
to untreated cells (P<0.05). Similarly to PDGFRα
inhibition, inhibition of Gli1 activation by the novel
clinically available Shh inhibitor (Shh-I) LDE225[41]
restored (P<0.05) and increased (P<0.05) melanoma
cells’ sensitivity to BRAF-I (Figure 7B). Furthermore,
LDE225 in combination with vemurafenib downregulated PDGFRα expression and inhibited ERK and
AKT activation in the BRAF-I sensitive and resistant
melanoma cells (Figure 7C). Lastly LDE225 (40 mg/
Kg/day) enhanced (p<0.001) the ability of vemurafenib
to inhibit the growth of M21 cells in SCID mice (Figure
7D). These results validated the association between Gli1
activation and PDGFRα up-regulation mediating BRAF-I
resistance.

DISCUSSION
PDGFRα is overexpressed in sarcoma and glioma.
It is involved in tumor growth, metastasis and neo
angiogenesis, as well as in the development of resistance
to cytotoxic therapy [42]. These functional properties
of PDGFRα are likely to reflect its ability to engage
signaling pathways, such as RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK and
PI3K/AKT which play a role in tumor cell proliferation
and aggressive phenotype. The present study demonstrates
that human melanoma cells express PDGFRα both in vitro
and in vivo. PDGFRα up-regulation in human melanoma
cells harboring the BRAF(V600E) mutation is shown
for the first time to be associated with the loss of their
sensitivity to the anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic
activity of the BRAF-I vemurafenib both in vitro and in
vivo. The association between PDGFRα up-regulation and
vemurafenib resistance reflects a cause-effect relationship.
Vemurafenib resistance is overcome in melanoma cells
which down-regulate PDGFRα expression following
transduction with a PDGFRα-specific shRNA. An
association between the PDGFRα and BRAF(V600E)
mutation is also observed in wild type PDGFRα
gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) which acquire the
BRAF(V600E) mutation when they develop resistance to
PDGFRα-I imatinib [43-46].

METHODS

PDGFRβ[11, 19] are involved in the acquired BRAF-I
resistance of melanoma. BRAF-I resistance induced by
IGFR and PDGFRβ, similar to PDGFRα, is mediated
by ERK and AKT activation. However as reported
by others[19] and as found by us (data not shown) the
PDGFRα/PDGFRβ inhibitors sunitinib and imatinib
are not able to overcome BRAF-I resistance mediated
by PDGFRβ up-regulation. The latter finding reflects
the lack of inhibition of ERK activation in spite of the
inhibition of AKT activation since the inhibition of
these two downstream components of the RAF/MEK/
ERK and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways by a PDGFRβspecific shRNA restored sensitivity of melanoma cells to
vemurafenib.
The potential clinical relevance of our results is
suggested by two lines of evidence. First, PDGFRα
expression was up-regulated in 5 out of the 9 matched
melanoma lesions with a BRAF(V600E) mutation,
surgically removed from patients who had developed
BRAF-I resistance. Second, the extent of PDGFRα
increase in melanoma lesions, as measured by the
increase in the percentage of stained melanoma cells,
was associated with the clinical course of the disease.
Specifically a marked increase in PDGFRα expression
was associated with a shorter time to progression and
less tumor regression based on RECIST criteria. Notably,
baseline expression of PDGFRα did not correlate with
response or time to progression. In order to utilize the
phenomenon we have observed as a method for patient
selection, one would need to monitor PDGFRα upregulation in tumor biopsy specimens or to develop a
noninvasive or surrogate method to detect PDGFRα upregulation.
The evidence we provide represents a strong
rationale to translate to a clinical setting the combinatorial
strategy we have shown to be effective in counteracting
the BRAF-I Gli1/PDGFRα-mediated resistance of
melanoma cells both in vitro and in vivo. The translation
of this approach into the clinic is facilitated by the
availability of Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
approved drugs to use in combination. Furthermore, these
data suggest that PDGFRα may be a useful biomarker to
identify patients with BRAF-mutant melanoma who will
or will not respond to BRAF-I or combination BRAF-I
and MEK-I. Lastly PDGFRα up-regulation has therapeutic
implications since BRAF(V600E) melanoma patients
with PDGFRα up-regulation may potentially benefit from
treatment with BRAF-I in combination with PDGFRα-I
or Shh-I.

Cell cultures
The parental BRAF(V600E) melanoma cell lines
Colo38 and M21 were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium
(Mediatech) supplemented with 2 mmol/L L-glutamine
(Mediatech) and 10% fetal calf serum (FCS; Atlanta
Biologicals). The cell lines M21 and Colo38 were
originated by the late Dr. Donald Morton (when he
was at the University of California) and by the late Dr.
George Moore (when he was at University of Colorado),
respectively, from metastatic lesions of patients with
melanoma. The BRAF(V600E) melanoma cell line TPF10-741 was cultured in DMEM (Mediatech) supplemented
with 2 mmol/L L-glutamine and 10% FCS. This cell line
was started from a cutaneous metastasis of the melanoma
patient TPF-10-741 who had developed BRAF-I resistance
following treatment with vemurafenib. Melanoma cell
lines with acquired vemurafenib resistance (Colo38R and
M21R) were generated by propagating parental Colo38
and M21 cells in increasing concentrations of BRAF-I
(up to 2 µM). At the end of 2 months, resistant cells were
isolated from each of the two cell lines and cultured in
RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 2 mmol/L
L-glutamine, 10% FCS and 500 nM vemurafenib. All cells
were cultured at 37°C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere.

Patient Samples
Patients with metastatic melanoma harboring the
BRAF(V600E) mutation (confirmed by genotyping) were
enrolled in clinical trials with the BRAF-I (vemurafenib)
or with the BRAF-I (dabrafenib) and MEK-I (trametinib)
combination. Patients were consented for tissue acquisition
per institutional review board (IRB)-approved protocol.

at 10-14 days on treatment, and/or at the time of disease
progression as defined by Response Evaluation Criteria
In Solid Tumors (RECIST) if applicable. Formalin-fixed
tissue was analyzed to confirm that viable tumor was
present via hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining.

The following primers were used: NRAS fragment

aligned to the human reference sequence using the
ClustalW2 v2.1 algorithm.

Cell proliferation and MTT assay

Transduction of melanoma cells with Lentiviral
vectors encoding shRNA

Cells were plated in triplicate in 96-well microtiter
plates at the density of 2.5 x 103 per well in 100ul of RPMI
1640 or DMEM medium supplemented with 2% FCS and
treated with vemurafenib and/or PDGFRα-I (sunitinib,
imatinib and crenolanib) and/or Shh-I LDE225. Dimethyl
sulfoxide (DMSO) (vehicle of the drugs) concentration
was maintained at 0.02% in all wells. Doses of drugs to
be used in the combinatorial treatment were chosen based
on their IC50 determined with the melanoma cell lines
tested. Cell proliferation was evaluated at the indicated
time points utilizing the MTT assay which was carried out
as reported elsewhere [56]. Data are expressed as percent
of inhibition or percent of proliferation of treated cells as
compared to untreated control cells. All experiments were
performed three independent times in triplicates.

M21R and TPF-10-741 cells were seeded at the
density of 6 x104 per well in a 6-well plate and incubated
in culture medium for 24 h at 37ºC in a 5% CO2
atmosphere prior to viral infection. Cells were transduced
with PDGFRα-specific shRNA lentiviral particles
[Target sequence: CCAGCCTCATATAAGAAGAAA

CAATGGACTTACCCTGGAGAA (#5)] (1 x 106 per well)
in presence of polybrene (2 μg/ml) as described elsewhere
[58]. Cells transduced with GFP-shRNA were used as a
control. Following an 18 h incubation at 37ºC, culture
medium was removed and replaced with fresh culture
medium. Following an additional up to 72 h incubation at
37ºC, cells were analyzed for GFP expression under the
microscope, split, enriched for infected cells by selection
with puromycin (2.5 ug/ml) and collected for further
analysis.

Western Blot analysis
For sample preparation from cell lines, cells were
seeded at the density of 1 x 105 per well in a 6-well plate
in medium supplemented with 2% FCS and the indicated
doses of each drug or their combinations at 37°C in a 5%
CO2 atmosphere for up to 72 h. The DMSO (vehicle of
the drugs) concentration was maintained at 0.02% in all
wells. Untreated cells were used as a control. Cells were
collected and lysed in lysis buffer [10 mM Tris–HCl
(pH 8.2), 1% NP40, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1% bovine serum
albumin (BSA), 150 mM NaCl) containing 1/50 (vol/vol)
of protease inhibitor cocktail (Calbiochem). For sample
preparation from tumor xenografts, tumors were harvested
from the mice when they were sacrificed and stored at
-80°C. Proteins were extracted by homogenization in the
presence of 2 to 5 ml lysis buffer. Western blot assay for
signaling-related proteins was carried out as described
[57]. The investigator who analyzed the sample from
tumor xenografts was blinded to the type of treatment
received by the mice used as the source of the tumor.

Immunohistochemistry
Patient biopsies and tumors generated in mice were
formalin fixed and paraffin embedded and then used as
substrates in immunohistochemical reactions. Five-µm
thick xenograft tissue sections were fixed on silane-coated
glass slides, deparaffinized, and subjected to antigen
retrieval (Target retrieval solution, DAKO). Following
blocking, slides from mice were incubated with Cleaved
Caspase-3 (Asp175) and p-Histone H3 (Ser10) –specific
mAbs overnight. Four-µm thick sections from patientderived samples were fixed on silane-coated glass slides,
deparaffinized, and subjected to antigen retrieval (Target
retrieval solution, DAKO). Sections were then incubated
with PDGFRα-specific mAb (sc-338, Santa Cruz)
(1:400) overnight. All sections were then washed with
PBS, and the primary antibody was amplified using the
VECTASTAIN ABC Kit (Peroxidase rabbit IgG, Vector
Laboratories, PK-4001). The detection of this antibody
was performed with the DAB Peroxidase Substrate Kit
from DAKO and the sections were counterstained with
H&E. Tissue from a human GIST and its lymphocyte
infiltrate were used as a positive and a negative control,
respectively, for PDGFRα expression. PDGFRα

RT-PCR
Total RNA was isolated from melanoma cells
using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen). Reverse transcription
was performed using SuperScript II Reverse
Transcriptase (Invitrogen) followed by qPCR using
Fast SYBR Green Master Mix (Applied Biosystems).

as a reference for the natural course of the disease. To
test vemurafenib and LD225 combination, mice were
randomly divided into 4 groups of 5 mice each. Mice
in Group 1 were treated with vemurafenib (12.5 mg/kg/
twice per day), those in Group 2 with LDE225 (40 mg/
Kg/day) [41], and those in Group 3 with vemurafenib
(12.5 mg/kg/twice per day) plus LDE225 (40 mg/kg/day).
Mice in Group 4 were left untreated as a reference for the
natural course of the disease. Drugs were administered by
oral gavage. When a tumor from untreated mice reached
the maximum diameter as approved by the Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) all mice were
sacrificed. Primary tumors and organs were collected for
further analysis. Animal studies have been approved by
the IACUC.

Statistical analysis

Assessment by flow cytometry of apoptosis
induction

Averages, standard deviations, and unpaired t-test
were calculated using MS-Excel. Data are shown as mean
± SD of the results obtained in at least three independent
experiments. Time of disease progression (time to
progression) of BRAF-I treated patients was studied
using the Kaplan-Meier method and difference between
groups was calculated using the log-rank test. Differences
between groups were considered significant when the P
value was < 0.05. The asterisk (*) indicates P<0.05.

Apoptosis was detected by cytometric staining
performed as described [59]. Briefly, apoptotic cells were
identified by staining with Annexin -V and propidium
iodide (PI) (BD Bioscience) for 15 min at room
temperature. Flow cytometry data were analyzed using
Summit v4.3 software (DAKO).
