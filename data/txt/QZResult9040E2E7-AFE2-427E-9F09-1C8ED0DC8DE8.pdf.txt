ABSTRACT
The transcription factor CREB (cAMP Response Element Binding Protein) is an
important determinant in the growth of Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) cells. CREB
overexpression increases AML cell growth by driving the expression of key regulators
of apoptosis and the cell cycle. Conversely, CREB knockdown inhibits proliferation
and survival of AML cells but not normal hematopoietic cells. Thus, CREB represents a
promising drug target for the treatment of AML, which carries a poor prognosis. In this
study, we performed a high-throughput small molecule screen to identify compounds
that disrupt CREB function in AML cells. We screened ~114,000 candidate compounds
from Stanford University’s small molecule library, and identified 5 molecules that
inhibit CREB function at micromolar concentrations, but are non-toxic to normal
hematopoietic cells. This study suggests that targeting CREB function using small
molecules could provide alternative approaches to treat AML.

INTRODUCTION

expression was observed in the majority of AML patients,
and this independently predicted a worse prognosis
and increased risk of relapse [1, 2]. Subsequent in vitro
studies revealed that CREB overexpression in AML cells
augments their growth rate and confers resistance to
apoptosis [2]. In contrast, CREB knockdown inhibited
AML cell proliferation and induced apoptosis, but had
no effect on normal hematopoietic stem cells in mouse
transduction/transplantation assays [3]. In addition, the
expression of this potential drug target is typically much
greater in AML cells compared to normal hematopoietic
cells, the ‘parental’ tissue of this cancer. This suggests
greater reliance on this transcription factor for AML cell
homeostasis [1, 2, 4]. Given these data, we hypothesize
that inhibition of CREB function may represent a novel,
effective and targeted approach to treat AML.
Previous reports have described successful
disruption of the association between CREB and its critical

Successful treatment of Acute Myelogenous
Leukemia (AML) remains a major clinical challenge.
The 5-year overall disease survival rate for AML has held
steady at less than 50% for the past 20 years, despite many
efforts to intensify and broaden treatment regimens. The
standard chemotherapeutics used for AML treatment are
themselves associated with significant risks of morbidity
and mortality, and while hematopoietic stem cell transplant
is a viable option for therapy, this approach poses an
additional set of risks for patients. For these reasons, it is
critical to identify novel therapeutic targets and develop
more effective, less toxic drugs for the treatment of
patients with AML.
Our group and others have identified CREB (cAMP
Response-Element Binding Protein) as one such potential
therapeutic target. In a previous study, elevated CREB

transcriptional co-activator CBP [5]. Post-translational
modification of CREB including phosphorylation,
acetylation, and SUMOylation, are critical for its function
[6]. CREB also differentially binds as a homodimer or
heterodimer with members of the ATF transcription factor
family, resulting in differential gene expression based on
the cellular context [6]. These observations demonstrate
that numerous CREB functionalities could be selected
for targeted disruption by a small molecule. Fortunately,
the advent of high-throughput screening has facilitated
exploration of a wide array of chemical moieties in search
of molecules which may disrupt any of these diverse
processes, even in the absence of a priori knowledge of
which of these processes are most important for cellular
homeostasis.
Thus, in this study, we performed a small molecule
screen in search of compounds capable of disrupting
CREB-driven transcription in AML cells. To this end,
we screened 114,124 candidate compounds from the
compound library available at the Stanford University
High-Throughput Bioscience Center. This collection was
assembled from several commercial vendors, including
ChemDiv, Specs, and Chembridge, and possesses drug-like
qualities [7]. These compounds were first tested for their
ability to specifically disrupt CREB-driven expression of
a reporter gene in KG-1 cells. Selected compounds that
passed this initial screen were validated and examined for
their ability to selectively kill AML cells, but not normal
hematopoietic cells, in vitro. Our study yielded five
structurally distinct and novel molecules that inhibit the
growth of AML cells at micromolar concentrations yet are
less toxic to normal hematopoietic cells than doxorubicin,
a conventional chemotherapeutic for AML. This study
thus describes the means for developing an assay to screen
for “transcription factor therapeutics”, and successfully
identified unique chemical candidates with potential for
drug development in the future.

allowed sufficient time for reporter gene transcriptional
downregulation, but preceded AML cell death. Of 114,124
compounds screened, 1481 reduced KG-1 CRE luciferase
activity by greater than 45% (Table 1). For this phase
of high-throughput screening, the Z’-factor was = 0.6,
coefficient of variance (CV) = 15% with no significant
edge or drift effects. Compounds that appeared as
being active in greater than two thirds of previously run
luciferase assays in the HTBC, with other transcription
factor binding sites, were eliminated as likely luciferase
inhibitors, while compounds that appeared as toxic
compounds in greater than two thirds of previously run
human cell viability assays were ruled as non-specific
toxic and eliminated from further studies.
Following this, 8-point dose-response curves
for each concentration in duplicate were generated for
980 selected compounds using both the KG-1 CRE and
KG-1 CMV cell lines. For the purposes of screening, this
approach facilitated the inclusion of compounds, which
selectively inhibited CREB-driven luciferase expression
for further study, and the exclusion of those compounds
which were luminescence inhibitors or which were nonselectively toxic. This extended screening identified
59 compounds with IC50 value ratios of > 2 in KG-1
CRE vs. KG-1 CMV cells, suggesting CREB-specific
transcriptional disruption (data not shown). With
3 exceptions, all of these compounds had IC50 values of
< 10 µM in KG-1 CRE cells. Based on each compound’s
absolute IC50, the ratio of IC50 values in each KG-1 cell
line, and each compound’s physico-chemical properties
and potential drug-like structure, 23 of these compounds
were selected for further study (Figure 1 and Table 2).

Validation of CREB inhibitors
To confirm the results of the high-throughput screen,
the selectivity of the 23 candidate compounds was first
validated in scaled-up luciferase activity experiments,
performed in duplicate (Figure 2). KG-1 CRE and KG-1
CMV cells were treated with compound concentrations
ranging from 30 nM to 30 µM for 24 hours. As shown,
this validation assay was able to discriminate between
selective compounds and inactive or insufficiently
selective compounds. Of 23 candidates, six compounds
demonstrated sufficient selectivity for further study, with
specific suppression of luciferase activity in KG-1 CRE
cells but not KG-1 CMV cells at a minimum of three
concentrations.
To examine whether these compounds were able to
kill AML cells in vitro, well-characterized HL-60 and KG-1
cells were treated with compound concentrations ranging
from 30 nM to 30 µM for 72 hours. Dose-response curves
for each of these six compounds were generated using the
Promega CellTiter Glo Viability Assay. Five compounds
showed low micromolar IC50 values when tested
against unmodified HL-60 and KG-1 AML cell lines for

RESULTS
High-throughput screen identifies candidate
CREB-inhibiting compounds
Since CREB represents a promising therapeutic
target for AML, a high throughput screen was conducted,
followed by validation assays, to identify potentially novel
disruptors of CREB function. To identify compounds
that specifically disrupt CREB-driven transcription,
we generated a KG-1 AML cell line expressing Firefly
luciferase in a CREB-specific manner (KG-1 CRE), and
a separate KG-1 cell line expressing Firefly luciferase
under the control of the CMV promoter (KG-1 CMV),
as described in Methods. The Stanford University’s
High-Throughput Bioscience Center’s (HTBC) Small
Molecule Library was first screened against KG-1 CRE
cells for 24 hours. This incubation period empirically

72 hours (Figure 3 and Table 3). Compound STF-038533
showed an IC50 of 410 nM, a potency comparable to that of
rationally-designed drugs in clinical use such as sorafenib
or ABT-737 [10, 11]. In contrast, compound STF-120123,
which showed excellent selectivity in decreasing
CREB-driven luciferase activity in KG-1 CRE vs.
KG-1 CMV cells, showed low potency in these assays.
Nonetheless, the potency of the five best compounds
compare favorably to potency values reported for
conventional chemotherapeutics used in AML treatment
regimens, including cytarabine, doxorubicin and
etoposide, when tested similarly in vitro. The structures
of each library hit are shown along with a summary of the
cell-based IC50 values (Table 3). Various chemotypes are
represented, reflecting the diversity of the library.

3.8 µM), a standard chemotherapeutic agent used for
AML treatment, was used as a control. The viable
cell count remaining after 72 hours in each treatment
condition is expressed as a percentage of cells present
following treatment with 0.1% DMSO solvent (Figure 4).
Doxorubicin caused a 46.5 ± 0.77% reduction in viable
cell count following 72 hours of treatment. Compounds
STF-046536 and STF-055910 caused viable cell
count reductions of 30.5 ± 1.16% and 14.5 ± 2.91%,
respectively, while all other compounds reduced the
viable cell count by < 5%. Thus, these compounds
possess favorable therapeutic indices, with better in vitro
potency and lower toxicity than doxorubicin. Given the
high potency (low IC50 value), selectivity and non-toxicity
of compound STF-038533, this molecule was analyzed
for its ability to reduce CREB target gene transcription.
The RFC3, POLD2 and Fra-1 genes each possess CRE
elements within 200 bp of their transcription start sites,
and previous work supports the importance of CREB
in regulating their transcription [8, 12]. RT-PCR data
show that the transcription of these genes in KG-1 cells
treated with 10 µM STF-038533 for 24 hours was reduced
compared to DMSO-treated cells. KG-1 cells with CREB
knockdown using shRNAs were used as a positive control
(Figure 5).

Non-toxicity of CREB inhibitors
Since CREB knockdown decreased AML cell
growth, but not that of normal hematopoietic cells in
transplantation assays, we wished to test whether these
putative CREB-inhibiting compounds were also non-toxic
to normal hematopoietic cells. Normal hematopoietic cells
were cultured in standard media as described in Materials
and Methods, and treated with 10 µM of each of the six
candidate compounds for 72 hours. Doxorubicin (2 mg/mL,

DISCUSSION

for eventual clinical use. In this study, we employed a
high-throughput screening strategy, which yielded five
chemically unique compounds, which demonstrated
promising in vitro potencies and efficacies and showed
little to no toxicity to normal hematopoietic cells
compared to doxorubicin.
In summary, the data presented here suggest that
the development of small molecules that target CREB
could lead to novel approaches to treat AML. Although
the compounds identified require structure-activity
relationship-based optimization, characterization of their
specific mechanism(s) of action, and in vivo testing prior
to their entry into clinical trials, our data encourage further
studies of the advantages of targeting this transcription
factor.

Recent preclinical reports have demonstrated the
efficacy of targeting transcription factors in specific
cancers [13–16]. The association of CBP with βand γ-catenin has been targeted using a small molecule,
and this strategy was effective against both primary and
relapsed ALL in mice [13]. Another group demonstrated
the efficacy of targeting the mutant fusion transcription
factor CBPβ-SMMHC, which drives inv(16)+ AML
[15]. The association between menin and MLL fusion
proteins, which drives subtypes of both AML and
ALL, has also been successfully targeted using a small
molecule [14]. These studies demonstrate the potential
of transcription factor-directed therapy, and encourage
further development of these novel candidate compounds

METHODS

each of these promoter cassettes were first assembled and
inserted 5′ to the Firefly luciferase gene harbored in the
pGL4.22 [luc2CP/Puro] vector (Promega). This Firefly
luciferase gene sequence contains two C-terminal protein
destabilizing sequences, hCL1 and hPEST, resulting in a
short protein half-life. These sequences facilitated early
measurement of luciferase transcriptional downregulation.
Lentiviruses were generated as previously described [9].

AML cell lines
AML cell lines were purchased from ATCC and
maintained with IMDM (Gibco) supplemented with 10%
FBS (Fisher Scientific) and 1% PSG (Gibco). KG-1 is
a well-characterized human AML cell line commonly
used to study novel therapies for AML. KG-1 cells were
established from a patient with AML and represents an
early stage of hematopoietic differentiation. KG-1 cells
are also p53 deficient. HL-60 is an AML cell line that was
derived from a patient with acute promyelocytic leukemia
in 1977. The cells can be induced to differentiate into
granulocytes or monocyte/macrophages. HL-60 cells
also overexpress myc. These two cell lines have been
extensively used to test novel molecules to potentially
treat AML.
Cell counts and viability were determined using the
Vi-CELL XR Cell Viability Analyzer (Beckman Coulter).
For the high-throughput screen, lentiviral gene delivery
was used to create two KG-1 cell lines designed to
express Firefly luciferase in either a CREB-specific or
non-specific fashion (Figure 6). Cells were cultured in
media containing 10% serum containing growth factors.
Under these conditions, CREB is phosphorylated and
activated. The promoter for CREB-specific expression of
luciferase was composed of two ‘CRE’ elements, which
are the canonical CREB DNA-binding sequences, placed
within −200 of the ATG start site and 5′ to an attenuated
CMV promoter (KG-1 CRE cells). Non-specific
luciferase expression was driven by the standard full
CMV promoter (KG-1 CMV cells). To create lentiviruses,

High-throughput screening
For this HTS to discover small molecules that
specifically disrupt CREB function, we screened ~114,000
compounds from the compound library at the Stanford
University High-Throughput Bioscience Center. These
compounds are drug-like and were assembled from various
commercial sources including, ChemDiv (60 K), Specs
(30 K), and Chembridge (23.5 K). The compound library
is arrayed in 384-well plates at a concentration of 5 mM in
100% DMSO, except for the Chembridge library which is
at a concentration of 2 mg/mL in 100% DMSO. The HTS
was performed by plating 25,000 KG-1 CRE cells in 50 µL
IMDM + 10% FBS + 1% PSG media per well in 384-well
solid-white tissue cultured treated plates, and adding ~100 nL
of candidate compounds using a V & P Scientific Pin
Tool attached to a Sciclone ALH3000 (CaliperLS, now
Perkin Elmer) resulting in a final concentration of ~10
µM or ~4 ug/mL for the Chembridge library. Each
compound was only screened once. The cells were
incubated for 24 hours at 37°C/5% CO2, in an automated
incubator (Liconic STX200) and subsequent luciferase
activity was assessed by adding 10 µL of a 1:3 mixture
of BrightGlo luciferin reagent (Promega) and media by

h PEST) was used in order to reduce this protein’s half-life and facilitate early changes in the expression of this reporter gene. The promoter
for CREB-specific expression of luciferase was composed of two ‘CRE’ elements, which are the canonical CREB DNA-binding sequences,
placed within −200 of the ATG start site and 5′ to the CMV minimal promoter (KG-1 CRE cells). For non-specific luciferase expression,
the full CMV promoter (KG-1 CMV cells) was placed 5′ to the luciferase gene.

at room temperature on a Tecan Infinite M1000 PRO
with integrated stackers, with 0.1 sec signal integration
time. The 24-hour incubation time was selected because
this allowed sufficient time for luciferase transcriptional
downregulation, but preceded anticipated decreases in cell
viability resulting from CREB inhibition. Compounds,
which caused > 45% reduced luciferase activity in KG-1
CRE cells were selected for further screening (see results
for more details). Hits were manually picked from stock
supplies and diluted to 100 µM in media (no serum) and
then serially diluted 1:1 in media (no serum) using the
High-Volume Head on the Sciclone ALH3000 (CaliperLS,
now Perkin Elmer). 10 µL of the serially diluted
compounds was added to the 40 µL of the cells (25 K/well).
An eight-point dose-response curve was generated for both
KG-1 CRE and KG-1 CMV cell lines using these methods
for selected compounds and performed in duplicate. The final
compound concentrations used for this secondary screen
were 20, 10, 5, 2.5, 1.25, 0.625, 0.3125, and 0.156 µM.

Normal human patient bone marrow samples were
purchased from StemCell Technologies. Bone marrow
cells were cultured in DMEM plus 20% FBS and 1% PSG,
supplemented with recombinant GM-CSF (20 ng/ml),
G-CSF (20 ng/ml), SCF (50 ng/ml), IL-3 (20 ng/ml), and
IL-6 (10 ng/ml). For candidate compound activity assays,
cells were plated at 1 × 105 cells/ml in a 12-well plate,
supplemented with a range of concentrations of candidate
compound, for 24 hours. Cell counts and viability were
determined using the Vi-CELL XR Cell Viability Analyzer
(Beckman Coulter).

Statistical analysis
Primary screening and secondary dose response data
were analyzed using Assay Explorer (MDL, now Biovia).
Z’ were calculated for all plates and plates that failed
validation (Z’ < 0.5) were re-screened. Unless noted, all
experiments were performed in triplicate, and Student’s
t-test was used to assess experimental mean values for
statistically significant differences, with p-values of < 0.05
deemed statistically significant.

Luciferase validation and cell viability assays
For candidate compound validation experiments,
KG-1 CRE or KG-1 CMV cells were plated at a density
of 2 × 105 cells/mL in a 96-well plate and incubated with
concentrations of candidate compounds ranging from
30 nM to 30 µM for 24 hours. Following this, 20 µL
of BrightGlo luciferin was added to each well and the
luciferase activity was measured using a Biotek Synergy
H1 spectrophotometer, 10 second integration time.
For candidate compound activity assays in AML cells,
unmodified KG-1 or HL-60 cells were plated in 96-well
plates at a density of 2 × 105 cells/mL and incubated with
concentrations of candidate compounds ranging from
30 nM to 30 µM for 24 hours. The Promega CellTiter-Glo
Luminescent Viability Assay (Promega) was used as per
manufacturer’s instructions to measure viable cell counts
after 72 hours. This timepoint was selected, as this is the
typical timepoint at which conventional chemotherapeutics
demonstrate maximal efficacy in in vitro assays.
