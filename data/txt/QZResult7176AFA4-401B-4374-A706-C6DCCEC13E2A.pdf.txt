Abstract
A current pressing need in cancer immunology is the development of preclinical model systems that are immunocompetent for
the study of human tumors. Here, we report the development of a
humanized murine model that can be used to analyze the pharmacodynamics and antitumor properties of immunostimulatory
monoclonal antibodies (mAb) in settings where the receptors
targeted by the mAbs are expressed. Human lymphocytes transferred into immunodeﬁcient mice underwent activation
and redistribution to murine organs, where they exhibited cellsurface expression of hCD137 and hPD-1. Systemic lymphocyte
inﬁltrations resulted in a lethal CD4þ T cell–mediated disease
(xenograft-versus-host disease), which was aggravated when
murine subjects were administered clinical-grade anti-hCD137

(urelumab) and anti-hPD-1 (nivolumab). In mice engrafted with
human colorectal HT-29 carcinoma cells and allogeneic human
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), or with a patientderived gastric carcinoma and PBMCs from the same patient, we
found that coadministration of urelumab and nivolumab was
sufﬁcient to signiﬁcantly slow tumor growth. Correlated with this
result were increased numbers of activated human T lymphocytes
producing IFNg and decreased numbers of human regulatory
T lymphocytes in the tumor xenografts, possibly explaining the
efﬁcacy of the therapeutic regimen. Our results offer a proof of
concept for the use of humanized mouse models for surrogate
efﬁcacy and histology investigations of immune checkpoint drugs
and their combinations. Cancer Res; 75(17); 3466–78. 2015 AACR.

Introduction

(4-1BB, TNFRSF9; ref. 4), with complete rejections of transplanted
tumors being achieved. The list of antibody speciﬁcities exerting
this type of effect in mice has grown and now encompasses
antagonists of PD-1, PD-L1/B7-H1, TIM-3, LAG-3, and agonists
of OX-40, GITR, CD40, and CD27 (5–7).
Antagonist mAbs anti-CTLA-4 have been developed in the
clinic (8, 9). One of these (ipilimumab) has shown evidence of
clinical beneﬁt (9, 10) in patients with metastatic melanoma at
the expense of a new type of adverse effects evoking organspeciﬁc autoimmune reactions (11). More recently, mAbs
blocking PD-1 to PD-L1/B7-H1 interactions have been tested
in melanoma, renal cell carcinoma, bladder carcinoma, Hodgkin lymphoma, and non–small cell lung cancer patients
(12–17). The exciting picture that emerges from phase I clinical
trials and their cohort extensions is that an important fraction
of patients shows durable objective clinical responses (18). The
previous success has prompted a number ongoing registration
phase III clinical trials. Available information indicates a clear
tendency for increased beneﬁt in patients whose tumor cells
express surface PD-L1/B7-H1, although responses are also
evoked in a fraction of PD-L1–negative cases (19). A pioneering
trial using combinations of ipilimumab with nivolumab (antihPD-1 mAb) has shown very rapid and profound objective
clinical responses (80% decline in tumor burden at week 12)
in metastatic melanoma patients with 53% response rates at the
maximum-tolerated dose (20). These results recently conﬁrmed
in a randomized phase II clinical trial (21) have been conducive

Cancer immunotherapy has been boosted in the clinic with the
advent of immunostimulatory monoclonal antibodies (mAb;
refs. 1, 2). The concept behind this ongoing revolution is that
the function of cells of the immune system can be modulated by
antibody molecules binding to receptors expressed on their cell
surface.
Mouse models in the late 1990s showed that this goal
could be attained by antagonist antibodies directed against
CTLA-4 (CD152; ref. 3) and agonist antibodies directed at CD137

Immunoavatar Mice Treated with Anti-hPD-1 and Anti-hCD137 mAbs

to an ongoing phase III clinical trial of this combinatorial
immunotherapy (NCT01844505).
Two anti-CD137 mAb are currently undergoing clinical development: urelumab and PF-05082566. Urelumab has been tested
at doses ranging from 0.1 to 10 mg/kg. At high doses, a fraction of
patients developed hepatitis that was severe in some cases,
including two fatalities (22). The safety of lower doses is currently
being retested (NCT00309023). Interest in these antibodies has
increased because it has been discovered that, in addition to
boosting antitumor CD8 T-cell responses, anti-CD137 mAb
enhance antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, thereby synergizing with rituximab (23), trastuzumab (24), and cetuximab
(25) in preclinical models. Clinical trials testing combinations of
anti-hCD137 mAbs with rituximab and cetuximab are also ongoing (NCT01307267, NCT01775631). The combination of nivolumab and urelumab has recently started phase I dose-escalation
clinical trials (NCT02253992) also undertaken with a combination of the anti-PD-1 mAb pembrolizumab and PF-05082566
(NCT02179918).
Suitable and predictive animal models to study the effect of
immunotherapy are an unmet need. Ideally, models would allow
different immunostimulatory mAbs to be combined and the
cellular and molecular events governing efﬁcacy and adverse
events to be characterized. In these animal experiments, the best
sequence of immunotherapy agents could be chosen, the mechanism of action understood, and potential predictive biomarkers
deﬁned. Human T lymphocytes, including peripheral blood lymphocytes, from cancer patients can be grafted into immunodeﬁcient mice strains. There are two main mouse strains that are
commonly used: nonobese diabetic (NOD)-severe combined
immunodeﬁcient (scid) and recombinant activating one or two
gene deﬁcient (Rag1/ and Rag2/). These strains can be
crossed to interleukin-2 receptor common g chain targeted mutation (IL2rg null) mice, which completely ablates natural killer (NK)
cell activity and enhances human cells engraftment. Engrafted
human T lymphocytes show xeno-reactivity against foreign major
histocompatibility (MHC) class I and II and other antigens from
the mice cells (26). As a result, T lymphocytes cause an inﬂammatory inﬁltrate in different organs that leads to wasting and
death of the animals after several weeks, a process known as
xenograft-versus-host disease (xGVHD; ref. 27). The transferred
human T lymphocytes are amenable to regulation by therapeutic
agents or adoptively transferred other immune cells such regulatory T cells (Treg). In this regard, xGVHD has been exploited to
study the molecular mechanisms of immunosuppression and
immunomodulatory therapies (28–31).
We have conﬁrmed the activation of human peripheral blood
lymphocytes after being xenografted in immunodeﬁcient
Rag2/IL2Rg null mice. As a result of becoming activated, transferred human T lymphocytes express the inducible surface antigens hPD-1 and hCD137 on their plasma membrane. This
allowed tests on the in vivo activity of the immunotherapeutic
mAbs urelumab (anti-hCD137) and nivolumab (anti-hPD-1),
both in the context of the xGVHD and immunity against concurrently xenografted human tumors.

(CIMA; Pamplona, Spain) under speciﬁc pathogen-free conditions. Animal experiments were in accordance with Spanish laws
and approval was obtained from the animal experimentation
committee of the University of Navarra (Pamplona, Spain; reference 172-12 approval).
Cell lines and primary tumor explants
The human colon cancer–derived HT-29 cell line (ATCC HTB38) was purchased from the American Type Culture Collection in
2013. A master cell bank was expanded upon arrival and a new
ampule is thawed every 4 months for experimentation. Cells were
cultured in RPMI-1640 supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated
fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin–streptomycin, all from Life
Technologies. The murine colon adenocarcinoma cell MC38 is a
colon adenocarcinoma cell line of C57BL/6 origin whose identity
has been veriﬁed by Idexx Radil (Case 6592-2012) and kept in the
master cell bank. This cell line was originally provided to us by
Dr. Karl E. Hellstr€
om (Harborview Medical Center, University of
Washington, Seattle, WA) and cultured in RPMI-1640-GlutaMax
medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco) and
50 mol/L 2-mercaptoethanol. A second-pass human gastric carcinoma explant obtained from a surgical specimen of a gastric
cancer donor patient, was generated at HM Universitario Sanchinarro (CIOCC; Madrid, Spain; protocol approval FHM.06.10), as
described previously (32).
Antibodies and human peripheral blood mononuclear cells
The following antibodies were developed, produced, and
quality controlled at Bristol-Myers Squibb facilities: nivolumab
(a fully human IgG4 anti-human PD-1); urelumab (a fully
human IgG4 anti-human CD137); and irrelevant human IgG4
as an isotype-matched control. Therapeutic anti-CD137 (clone
1D8), anti-PD-1 (clone RMP1-14), anti-CD4 (clone GK1.5),
anti-CD8 (clone 2.43), and anti-NK1.1 (clone PK136) mAbs
were produced and puriﬁed by afﬁnity chromatography on
protein-G from the corresponding hybridomas. Peripheral
blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated from buffy
coats provided by the blood bank of Navarra, Spain, after
written informed consent (Ethics Committee from the University Clinic of Navarra 007/2007 and 013/2009) or from 30 mL
peripheral blood samples drawn from the gastric carcinoma
patient, on three occasions, under individual informed consent
(protocol approval FHM.06.10).
Collection of transferred lymphocytes in mice peritoneum
Rag2/IL2Rg null mice were injected with 1  107 human
PBMCs intraperitoneally (i.p.). Peritoneal lavages were performed
at different time points and the recovered cells were analyzed by
ﬂow cytometry.

monitored daily up to 3 months. Animals that developed clinical
symptoms of xGVHD (>15% weight loss, hunched posture,
reduced mobility, fur loss, tachypnea) were sacriﬁced and an
endpoint of survival was recorded. In some experiments mice
were sacriﬁced on day 22 and lung and liver were surgically
removed, weighed, and processed for immunohistochemistry
(IHC) and ﬂow cytometry analysis.
Tumor experiments
Three- to 4-week Rag2/IL2Rg null mice old were injected with
7  106 human fresh PBMCs i.p. and a total of 3.5  106 HT29
human colon carcinoma cells were injected subcutaneously (s.c.)
into the ﬂank of Rag2/IL2Rg null mice in 50 mL of PBS on day 0 of
the experiment. Mice were treated intravenously with antihCD137 (urelumab, 200 mg per injection), anti-hPD-1 (nivolumab, 200 mg per injection), Combo (nivolumab þ urelumab,
200 mg per injection each), or isotype-matched control (200 mg of
irrelevant hIgG4) on days 6, 14, and 20. Plasma samples were
prepared from blood collected in heparin 1 day before the ﬁrst
injection of treatment and after the ﬁrst and second injection.
Plasma samples were stored at 80 C until use. Tumor growth
was recorded every 3 to 4 days. Mice were sacriﬁced on day 22 and
s.c. tumors were removed, weighed, and processed for IHC and
ﬂow cytometry analysis.
In addition, 3- to 4-week-old Rag2/IL2Rg null mice were
injected i.p. with 2 or 7  106 human PBMCs from a gastric
cancer patient on day 0 of experiment. Explants (7 mm  7 mm)
from the tumor of the same patient were implanted s.c. into the
ﬂank of Rag2/ IL2Rg null mice on day 3 of the experiment. Mice
were treated i.v. as indicated above on days 5, 12, and 19. Tumor
growth was monitored every 3 to 4 days. On day 22 of experiment
mice were sacriﬁced, tumors removed, and studied by quantitative immunoﬂuorescence (QIF). Tumor growth analyses were
limited to 3 to 4 weeks because following this period of time
mice started to show signs of xGVHD.
Immunohistochemistry
Tissues were recovered from mice at necropsy, formalin-ﬁxed
and embedded in parafﬁn. IHC was performed using the following mAbs against CD3 (clone SP7), CD4 (clone SP35), and CD8
(clone SP6). Details are provided in the Supplementary Methods
Appendix.
Multiplexed quantitative immunoﬂuorescence
QIF was performed using multiplexing panels including antibodies against human cytokeratin (hCK, clone AE1/AE3) and
mAbs against hCD137 (clone GW2.4), hPD-1 (clone 5C3), and
hPD-L1 (clone E1L3N; ref. 33). Additional QIF studies included
simultaneous detection of hCK (clone M3515), hCD3 (clone
E272), hCD8 (clone C8/144B), and hCD20 (clone L26) as
recently described (34). Details are provided in the Supplementary Methods Appendix.
Antibodies and ﬂow cytometry
Lung, liver, and tumor tissue was processed for ﬂow cytometry
analysis. Fluorochrome-conjugated mAbs to the following
human antigens were used: CD3 (UCHT1), CD4 (OKT4), CD8
(RPAT8), CD45 (HI30), FoxP3 (150D), Ki-67 (B56), CD279/PD1 (EH12.2H7), TIM-3 (F38-2E2), and PD-L1/B7-H1 (29E.2A3)

(deltaG9) from BD Pharmigen. FACSCanto II and FACSCalibur
(BD Biosciences) were used for cell acquisition and data analysis
was carried out using the FlowJo software (TreeStar Inc.). Details
are provided in the Supplementary Methods Appendix.
ELISA assays
Levels of human IFNg and human TNFa in mouse plasma
samples were measured by a commercial enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA; Human IFNg Elisa Set, BD OptEIA, BD
Biosciences and Human TNFa Elisa Development Kit; Peprotech), according to the manufacturer's instructions. All samples
were measured in duplicate. The detection cutoff levels of the
assay were 4.7 and 15 pg/mL for IFNg and TNFa, respectively. The
coefﬁcient of variation was <15%.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were performed with the Prism 6.0 software
(GraphPad Software) Macintosh version. The nonparametric
Mann–Whitney U test was applied to compare the results between
groups of treatment. Survival curves were analyzed by the Kaplan–
Meier method and compared by log-rank tests. Growth of tumors
was compared by a nonlinear regression analysis. A two-tailed
P  0.05 was considered as statistically signiﬁcant.

Results
Activation and expression of the targets for immunostimulatory
mAbs on human T lymphocytes engrafted in immunodeﬁcient
mice
Rag2/IL2Rg null mice are devoid of T, B, and NK lymphocytes.
Intraperitoneal injection of human PBMC gives rise to the engraftment of viable CD4þ and CD8þ T lymphocytes that can be
sequentially retrieved by peritoneal lavage over 4 weeks following
adoptive transfer. It is well known that human T lymphocytes
develop pathogenic xeno-reactivity when they are transferred into
mice and become activated (27). hCD3þ-gated T cells such as
hCD4þ and hCD8þ T lymphocytes underwent blastic activation,
which peaked on days 5 to 9 (Fig. 1A and Supplementary
Fig. S1A), as shown by enlargement revealed by the forward
scatter and side scatter parameters. Such T lymphocytes underwent proliferation as observed by intracellular immunostaining
with Ki-67 on gated hCD4þ and hCD8þ T cells from the sequential peritoneal lavages (Fig. 1B and Supplementary Fig. S1B). The
activation/exhaustion markers TIM-3 and LAG-3 have also been
studied showing an initial activation during ﬁrst 5 days and a
second peak of coexpression with PD-1 that might reﬂect T
lymphocyte exhaustion after 4 weeks (Supplementary Fig. S1C).
CD137 and PD-1 are respectively important receptors for
costimulation and coinhibition of T cells whose expression on
the plasma membrane is known to be induced by antigen
stimulation. Figure 1C shows that both receptors were induced
on the adoptively transferred human lymphocytes over time.
hCD137 was induced mainly on hCD8þ T lymphocytes, while
hPD-1 was induced on both T-cell subsets with very bright
intensity. PD-1 ligand 1 (PD-L1/B7-H1) was also induced in T
cells, with a peak on day 5 (Supplementary Fig. S1D).
To analyze whether anti-hCD137 (urelumab) and anti-hPD-1
(nivolumab) mAbs were binding to their corresponding receptors
in vivo, ﬂow cytometry of transferred lymphocytes was performed
ex vivo. As shown in Supplementary Fig. S2, the ﬂuorescence
intensity of CD137 and PD-1 staining was decreased on human

T cells recovered from anti-hCD137 and anti-hPD-1–treated mice,
but not on T cells from untreated mice.
These data conﬁrm that transferred human T lymphocytes in
Rag2/IL2Rg null become activated during the ﬁrst 7 days and
consequently express on the cell-surface hCD137 and hPD-1, thus
becoming susceptible targets to be manipulated by immunomodulatory mAbs.
Adoptive transfer of human T lymphocytes causes a xenograft
versus host disease that is exacerbated by urelumab and
nivolumab and abrogated by CD4þ depletion
xGVHD is considered a valuable model to test immunomodulatory strategies, where the engrafted human T lymphocytes are
amenable for regulation by therapeutic agents (29, 31). After 3 to
4 weeks we observed that transferred T lymphocytes started to
inﬁltrate the spleen, liver, and lung with signs of serious tissue
damage after 4 to 5 weeks (Supplementary Fig. S3). Accordingly,
we observed that mice injected with 107 human PBMC (Fig. 2A)
started losing weight at 3 to 4 weeks after adoptive transfer and in
most instances succumbed 1 week later showing signs of respiratory distress, hunched posture, and/or fur loss.
Having conﬁrmed the expression of hCD137 and hPD-1 in
human T lymphocytes inﬁltrating the liver and spleen (Supplementary Fig. S4), we tested whether the administration of immunostimulatory mAbs exacerbated xGVHD. We injected mice with

www.aacrjournals.org

107 human PBMC and treated them with the clinical-grade mAbs
urelumab (anti-hCD137), nivolumab (anti-hPD-1), a combination of the two (Combo) or saline (control) on days 4, 7, and 10
after lymphocyte transfer. Mice were followed for lethal xGVHD
and a signiﬁcant decrease in overall survival was observed in the
nivolumab (P < 0.001) and Combo (P < 0.05) groups as compared with the control group, while urelumab showed a tendency
that did not reach statistical signiﬁcance (Fig. 2B). Details of the
H&E and CD3þ spleen, liver, and lung inﬁltration in a representative mouse of each group of treatment are depicted in Fig. 2C,
showing marked perivascular T lymphocyte inﬁltrations in these
organs, more intense when under treatment with the mAbs. To
understand the role of speciﬁc immune cell subsets, we repeated
the xGVHD model injecting hPBMC that were selectively predepleted of speciﬁc leukocyte subpopulations by immunomagnetic
sorting. These included selective depletions of CD4þ, Treg, CD8þ,
CD56þ, and CD14þ populations checked to be complete by ﬂow
cytometry (data not shown). Transferred mice were treated with
Combo (nivolumab and urelumab mAbs). The control group was
injected with hPBMC and treated with hIgG4. Notably, mice
injected with hPBMC depleted from CD4þ T cells did not develop
xGVHD and survival, extended over 80 days, was signiﬁcantly
higher than mice injected with hPBMC and treated with Combo
(P < 0.01) or hIgG4 (P < 0.01; Supplementary Fig. S5A). Depletion
of other immune cells did not signiﬁcantly affect the survival of

mice and only Treg depletion showed a trend to increase
the severity of xGVHD, in comparison with mice injected with
hPBMC and treated with Combo (Supplementary Fig. S5B).
Notably, human-IFNg plasma levels were almost undetectable
in mice transferred without CD4þ T cells (Supplementary
Fig. S5C).
As a whole, these data indicate that the administration of the
mAbs was active, resulting in enhanced functional stimulation of
transferred T cells that migrate to visceral organs and exacerbate a
xGVHD that is primarily driven by IFNg-producing CD4þ T
lymphocytes.
Urelumab and nivolumab enhance the functional activation of
adoptively transferred human T lymphocytes
A hallmark function of activated T lymphocytes is the production of cytokines. Therefore, we studied the concentrations of
human IFNg (hIFNg) in sequential plasma samples of mice
undergoing treatment with urelumab, nivolumab, the combination (Combo) or the control group. Following the second dose,
urelumab-treated mice showed an increase of hIFNg plasma levels
in comparison with the control group (P < 0.05; Fig. 3A). Nivolumab as a single agent did not signiﬁcantly increase hIFNg
plasma levels, but in combination with urelumab there was a
further increase of plasma over control or nivolumab single
treatment (P < 0.01). Production of this cytokine might depend
on lymphocyte numbers producing it. Indeed, we observed that
mice treated with urelumab or Combo, showed higher densities
of blastic hCD3þ and hCD8þ lymphocytes in the liver inﬁltrates
(Fig. 3B).
It is also possible that antibody treatment may result in functional changes on a per-cell basis. In this regard, we observed that
in animals treated with nivolumab lung-inﬁltrating hCD4þ and
hCD8þ T lymphocytes showed higher intensity of expression of

the intracellular cytotoxic effector molecule perforin in comparison with control group (Fig. 3C).
Xenografted human colorectal carcinoma is controlled by
allogeneic human PBMC under stimulation with urelumab
and/or nivolumab
The experimental setting described in Rag2/IL2Rg null mice
permits both transfer of human PBMC and the grafting of subcutaneous tumors derived from transplantable human cell lines.
We used the HT29 human colorectal carcinoma cell line that gives
rise to rapidly progressing subcutaneous tumors in these mice
(36). To explore if under these conditions anti-hCD137, antihPD-1, or their combination could interfere with tumor progression, we treated these mice with urelumab, nivolumab, Combo
(urelumabþnivolumab), or isotype control (irrelevant hIgG4) on
days 6, 14, and 20 as depicted in Fig. 4A.
We individually followed tumor growth over time. In a
series of three experiments, it became clear that control mice
without hPBMC experienced a faster tumor growth than those
mice with concomitant adoptive transferred of hPBMC. Under
these conditions, treatment with the immunostimulatory
mAbs led to a clear stabilization of the experimental tumors
in most instances that was of comparable efﬁcacy to each

after the second antibody dose as compared with the control
group (P < 0.05; Fig. 4C). After the ﬁrst dose a signiﬁcant
increase (P < 0.05) in TNFa plasma levels was also observed in
the Combo-treated group in contrast with the control (irrelevant hIgG4) group (data not shown).
As a control, mice bearing HT29 human tumors but without

treatment when compared with the hIgG4-treated control group
(Supplementary Fig. S6).
To evaluate the role of the different immune cells controlling
tumor growth, we tested the combination of anti-mCD137 (clone
1D8) and anti-mPD1 (clone RMP1-14) mAbs in a murine syngeneic model bearing murine colon cancer (MC38). We found
that depletion of CD8þ cells signiﬁcantly abrogate the antitumor
effect of the combinatorial treatment, while CD4, NK, or macrophage depletions did not affect the antitumor effect with the
combinatorial treatment (Supplementary Fig. S7).
Studying cell suspensions of tumor-inﬁltrating lymphocytes
To address the mechanism of action of urelumab and nivolumab either alone or in combination, the human CD4þ and CD8þ
T lymphocyte density was analyzed in tumors excised on day 22
from the experimental groups of mice, as depicted in Fig. 4A. The
Combo treatment led to more dense inﬁltrates of hCD8þ
T lymphocytes in comparison with control group (P < 0.001)
and also in comparison with each antibody given alone (urelumab, P < 0.01; nivolumab, P < 0.05; Fig. 4D, left).
The role of regulatory T lymphocytes is known to be important in dampening antitumor immunity (37). We observed that
treatment with urelumab alone or in combination with nivolumab showed a signiﬁcant improvement in the intratumoral
hCD8þ T cells/hCD4þFOXP3þ ratio when compared with the
control group (P < 0.01; Fig. 4D, right). In the group in which
urelumab was administered as a single agent, it seems that this
improvement is dependent of a signiﬁcant decrease in Treg
number per gram of tumor tissue (Fig. 4D, center), while in the
Combo group it is more dependent on an increase in total CD8
T cells over Tregs (Fig. 4D, left). Of note, tumor-inﬁltrating
lymphocytes (TIL) under treatment with urelumab or Combo
showed a tendency to express higher protein levels of the

transcription factor EOMES in hCD4þ and hCD8þ T cells on
a per cell basis, when analyzed by intracellular staining (data
not shown).
Pathologic examination of tumors excised on day 22 (Fig. 5)
showed denser inﬁltrates of human T cells upon treatment with
the immunostimulatory mAbs that progressed inwards from the
peripheral rim of the tumors and sparsely reached to the core of
the round tumor lesions. Indeed, both the densities of human
hCD4þ and hCD8þ T cells were increased. In the case of mice
treated by the Combo treatment, the inﬁltrate was denser than in
the single-agent treatment tissue samples, and human T cells
inﬁltrated more clearly the central part of the tumor lesions
(Fig. 5).
PD-L1/B7-h1, hPD-1, and hCD137 are present in the
xenografted tumors
PD-L1/B7-H1 is known to be induced on malignant cells by
inﬂammatory lymphokines such as IFNg. Hence, it is considered
an adaptive mechanism of resistance to immune attack (38).
Indeed, HT-29 cells cultured in the presence of hIFNg readily
upregulate surface PD-L1/B7-H1 (data not shown). Analyzing
the xenografted tumors under treatment using multiplexed
immunoﬂuorescence, which highlight the mAb targets as well
as the tumor cells, it became clear that carcinoma cells were
indeed expressing PD-L1/B7-H1 (Fig. 6 and Supplementary
Fig. S8). PD-1 signal was allocated predominantly in lymphoid
cells at the periphery of the neoplasms and PD-L1 staining was
higher toward the tumor center/core. Both markers showed
predominant membranous staining pattern (Supplementary
Fig. S8). The proportion of cytokeratin-positive tumor cells was
prominently lower and the PD-L1 signal, in these cells, was higher
in the Combo treatment than in the control condition (Fig. 6 and
Supplementary Fig. S9).

(urelumabþnivolumab), or isotype control (hIgG4) i.v. on days 6, 14, and 20. Tumor volumes were measured twice per week until mice were sacriﬁced on day 22 of

ratio of number of human CD8 T cells per number of human Treg (right) are depicted.  , P < 0.05;   , P < 0.01. Error bars represent SEM. T, tumor; P, hPBMCs.

It is of note that the TILs in those tumors under treatment showed
as well membrane expression of hCD137 (Fig. 6). Taken together,
these results demonstrate that the hPD-1–PD-L1 pathway and
hCD137 are available targets in the tumor inﬁltrate to be modulated by the exogenously provided mAbs. In addition, the selective
expression of PD-L1/B7-H1 toward the center of the tumor, right
beneath a peripheral rim enriched in hCD3þ/hCD137þ/hPD-1þ,
suggests that these T lymphocytes are in an activated state but may
not be able to gain access to the PD-L1 enriched tumor core. Thus,
such T cells are conceivably amenable to be both unrepressed and
costimulated to further increase tumor cell destruction.

lymphocytes in the tumor microenvironment (Fig. 7C) and an
increase in hCD3þ cells in Combo-treated group in contrast to
control group that reached statistical signiﬁcance only within the
tumor compartment (P < 0.05; Fig. 7D, left) but not in the stromal
compartment (Fig. 7D, right), suggesting more penetration of TILs
into the tumor bed. No signiﬁcant change in the human TIL
subpopulations was noted with the other treatment modalities
(Fig. 7D). We could not detect CD20þ human B cells in any of the
samples analyzed. It is of note, that in tumors from mice treated
with combination therapy showed extensive necrosis, a phenomenon not seen in the other treatment groups (data not shown).
Moreover, in the urelumab and Combo-treated groups the number of Treg per gram of tumor decreased (Fig. 7E, right) while the
CD8þ:Treg cells ratio was increased (Fig. 7D, left). In this line, a
study at day 22 of human lymphocytes in the peripheral blood
from treated mice showed a higher percentage of hCD3þ lymphocytes in the Combo group when compared with the isotypematched antibody control (hIgG4) group (Supplementary Fig.
S10C). Finally, we measured PD-L1/B7-H1 expression using QIF
and found positive immunoreaction in both the tumor and
stromal compartments (Supplementary Fig. S10D), with a tendency to express higher levels of PD-L1 in tumor than in stromal
compartment, particularly in groups treated with anti-hPD1 alone
or in combination with anti-hCD137, a ﬁnding compatible with a
higher penetration of the TILs in the tumor bed as can be seen
in Fig. 7C (Combo group).
These results conﬁrm the antitumor activity of the mAbs
observed in previous experiments and provide indications of a
more pronounced effect with the combination treatment. In
addition, the ﬁndings open the possibility of studying the
mechanisms of action and pharmacodynamics of immunostimulatory antibodies against human targets in an autologous tumorlymphocyte experimental setting.

Immunoavatar Mice Treated with Anti-hPD-1 and Anti-hCD137 mAbs

Discussion
This study provides a new model to characterize in vivo the
effects of immunomodulatory mAbs that are being used in the
clinic for patients with cancer, an issue that is of particular
importance given that predictive modeling in cancer immunotherapy with immunostimulatory mAbs is as yet a largely unmet
need.
Transplantable tumors in immunocompetent mice allow for
the identiﬁcation of therapeutic strategies and for detailed analyses of the immune mechanisms of action, but the value of these
animal models for predicting the eventual outcome of patients is
often questioned (39). There are inherent problems due to major
differences in the interplay of artiﬁcially inoculated tumor cells
and a mouse immune system, which shows major divergences
with its human counterpart (40). Oncogene-transgenic mice
developing spontaneous tumors might be more predictable for
immunotherapies but still rely on a murine immune system and
are conceivably less antigenic than those malignancies that have
undergone conventional carcinogenesis, with many mutations
resulting in neoantigens (41–43). In addition, most immunostimulatory antibodies developed for clinical use do not recognize
mouse receptors precluding their preclinical evaluation in these
cancer models.
As an alternative, it is conceptually and experimentally possible
to repopulate profoundly immunodeﬁcient mice with human
lymphocytes in progressively more sophisticated reconstitution
models (44). Repopulation can be attained from transferred
mature lymphocytes (45) and from CD34þ stem cells that differentiate into lymphocytes in mice (46). Even if caveats exist
associated with all these models in the reproduction of human
cancer immunotherapy, the models offer interesting insights
especially with regard to new therapeutic agents. The only other
alternative model for human immunostimulatory mAb in
rodents is knockin transgenic mice for the human version of the
mAb target molecules. However, these mice also have problems
due to the fact that treatments are to be tested in mice bearing
tumors of mouse origin and in the context of a murine rather than
a human immune system.
For experimentation with clinical-grade anti-hCD137 and
anti-hPD-1 mAb, our model of reconstituted Rag2/IL2Rgcnull
offers the advantage that the induction of the targeted molecules are expressed on transferred T lymphocytes, in such a way
the antibodies can mediate their effects once infused into such
mice. The antigen recognition repertoire of human CD4 and
CD8 T lymphocytes contains abundant T-cell receptors that
mediate recognition of mouse histocompatibility xenoantigens
and this is most likely the reason justifying bright and homogeneous surface expression of hPD-1 and hCD137 as a result of
activation (45).

The effects of anti-hPD-1 mAb are mainly dependent on the
blockade of PD-1 with its natural ligands (PD-L1/B7-H1, PD-L2).
Of note, mouse PD-L1/B7-H1 interacts with human PD-1 (47)
and human activated T cells express human PD-1. Moreover, if
mice are also inoculated with human tumor cells, the malignant
cells are induced to express PD-L1/B7-H1 colocalizing for the
most extent with T-cell inﬁltrates (Supplementary Fig. S6). This
phenomenon originally described by Dong and colleagues (48) as
a mechanism of inducible resistance has been recently observed in
cancer patients (5). In contrast, CD137 is a T-cell costimulatory
receptor and the effect of anti-hCD137 mAb to increase T-cell
function is independent on the presence of CD137-ligand in the
system.
One limitation of our model is that the animals develop and
most often succumb to xGVHD and as a result experiments
must be performed before disease onset, limiting the suitable
time span for the experiments to 3 to 4 weeks after engraftment.
It is of much interest that this disease is exacerbated by the
immunostimulatory mAbs in a CD4þ-T cell–dependent manner. Indeed, treatment led to earlier and more severe inﬁltration
of lymphocytes in xGVHD target organs when mice are treated
with the clinical-grade immunostimulatory mAbs and this
effect is abrogated when CD4þ-T cells are depleted from the
leukocyte infusion. Experiments reporting on the immunopathologic effects of immunomodulatory mAb in humanized
mice have been previously reported by Vudattu and colleagues
(49) in humanized mice reconstituted with human CD34þ
stem cells and treated with clinical-grade anti-CTLA-4 mAb
(ipilimumab). This setting offers possibilities to study treatment strategies for the immune-related adverse events secondary to these new therapeutic agents (50). In particular, liver
inﬂammation selectively observed in mice treated with antihCD137 (urelumab) might serve as a model to address the liver
inﬂammation observed in a fraction of cancer patients treated
with the anti-hCD137 mAb (22). If controlled T-cell donors are
repeatedly used, the model is potentially suitable for correlating individual variability due to gene polymorphisms and with
the severity of the adverse reactions and the therapeutic effects.
In our studies we used T cells from donors unrelated to the
patient from whom the HT-29 tumor cell line was derived.
Under these conditions, there is ample alloreactivity based on
the recognition of MHC alloantigens in the transplanted tumor
cells. Even though this setting is clearly not mimicking the
response against tumor-associated neoantigens, the model
permits pharmacodynamic assessments on the effects of
immunostimulatory mAbs, such as increases in plasma hIFNg
levels or increases in tumor tissue hCD8:hTreg ratios, thereby
offering mechanistic clues to be molecularly explored in the
model. In line with this, our results provide evidence for more

efﬁcacious immune responses and more dense and active
tumor inﬁltrating lymphocytes upon treatment with mAbs
that control tumor progression. Similar observations were
recently reported in melanomas from patients treated with
the anti-PD-1 mAb pembrolizumab (51) and diverse carcinomas treated with the anti-PD-L1 antibody MPDL3280a (52).
Interestingly, T lymphocytes that had trafﬁcked to the tumor
preserved the expression of hPD-1 and hCD137 and therefore
could be continuously released from PD-1 inhibition while
receiving CD137 artiﬁcial costimulation. Detailed analyses
of such TILs retrieved from excised tumors were possible.
Surprisingly, lymphocytes were mainly distributed at the margin of the tumor as has been described in tumor samples
from colon cancer patients (53, 54). Such a pattern suggests a
common mechanism in tumors hindering lymphocyte invasion of the tumor core. Of note, expression of PD-L1/B7-H1
has been detected mainly at the border of the tumor probably
acting as a molecular shield against neighboring T lymphocytes, which perhaps would otherwise actively penetrate
the tumor core. Indeed, research in colon cancer has pioneered
the important predictive role of the dynamics of activation
and location of TILs in the tumor for the progression of the
patients (54, 55).
Previous studies in mice have indicated that anti-CD137 and
PD-1/PD-L1 blockade is synergistic for tumor treatment (56,
57). In our hands, both antibodies as single agents control
allogeneic tumors but the result of combining both mAb is not
constantly better. However, TILs in the combined treatment
were more numerous and showed more robust signs of activation, which strongly advocates for testing this combination in
cancer patients. These results suggest that there is room for
testing different doses and dosing schedules of the immunostimulatory mAbs in order to ﬁnd therapeutic synergy or
reduced side effects.
The potential of the model is best illustrated by a human gastric
carcinoma xenografted in immunodeﬁcient mice previously
injected with tumor-autologous T cells in which the fate of the
tumor xenografts is followed under treatment with nivolumab
(anti-hPD-1) and urelumab (anti-hCD137). Evidence for delayed
tumor growth is remarkable in treated animals, both in monotherapy or in combination, and speaks of the extraordinary
potential of these mAb that are being developed in clinical trials,
including the PD-1 and CD137-targeted combinatorial treatment
(NCT02253992 and NCT02179918). In our experiments, we
found signiﬁcant increases in CD8:Treg ratio and hCD3/tumor
cells in the tumor microenvironment of mice treated with the
urelumabþnivolumab combination that were absent in tumors
from mice undergoing single-agent treatments. Tumor-immunoavatar mouse models of this kind involving treatment with

immunostimulatory mAbs may provide useful answers for the
design and execution of clinical trials with these novel and
promising agents, either in monotherapy or in combination.
