ABSTRACT
Despite improvements in the diagnosis and treatment of hepatocellular
carcinoma (HCC), the prognosis is still poor. Pioneering work has demonstrated a
potential role for tumour cell-derived exosomes (TEXs) in HCC. TEXs can mediate
immune responses, antigen presentation and intracellular communication by serving
as vehicles for the transfer of proteins, viruses, lipids and RNA between cells. An
improved understanding of the roles played by exosomes could lead to a powerful
new strategy for preventing and treating HCC. In this review, we summarise current
understanding on the topic. The literature points to two faces of TEXs in HCC: 1) They
can promote invasion, metastasis, immune evasion and modulation and 2) they can
act as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers, and can be used in anti-cancer drug
resistance and immunotherapy in the future.

INTRODUCTION

of TEXs, such as microRNA (miRNA) and oncoproteins,
reflect the specific characteristics of their endosomal
origin [9, 10]. TEXs are protected against degradation
from enzymes (e.g., RNAse), as they are enclosed in a
lipid bilayer [11]. Importantly, these enriched miRNAs
and proteins in TEXs are selected, suggesting that
the exosomal content may provide novel serological
biomarkers for various types of cancer [12-14]. For
example, research has suggested that glypican-1 could be
used to detect early-stage pancreatic cancer [12] and that
miR-21 and miR-93 could be used to detect early-stage
HCC [13, 15]. In addition, TEXs can influence cancer
progression and metastasis by the transfer of genetic
materials between cells in the tumor microenvironment
[16]. Thus, the evidence indicates that exosomes have
various key roles in the development of cancer. An
improved understanding of these roles may lead to the
development of a powerful new strategy for preventing
and treating HCC.
In this review, we summarize the roles and
probable mechanisms of exosomes in HCC. In particular,

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common
cancer, with high morbidity and mortality, which places
a heavy financial burden on sufferers, especially those
in developing countries [1]. Despite developments in
imaging, chemotherapy, interventional radiology, surgical
techniques, and liver transplantation for HCC within the
past two decades, the prognosis is still poor, and HCC
remains the third most frequent cause of cancer-related
deaths [2, 3]. At present, the best hope of improving
the long-term survival of HCC patients is to detect the
cancer at an early stage [4]. However, current noninvasive
screening tools, such as serum α-fetoprotein and imaging
(ultrasonography), are not highly sensitive, especially in
the early diagnosis of HCC [5-7]. As with many other
cancers, drug resistance, recurrence, and metastasis are
the most important and difficult problems in the treatment
of HCC [3].
Recently, tumor-derived exosomes (TEXs) have
shown promise in the field of cancers [8]. The contents

considering the key role of miRNAs in cancer, we focus
on exosomal miRNAs and their potential utility in HCC.
The aim of the review is to illustrate the potential clinical
applications of exosomes in the detection and treatment
of HCC.

inward budding of endosomal membranes and finally
result in a large multivesicular body (MVB). ILVs in a
MVB released into the extracellular space are referred to
as “exosomes,” which typically have a size of 30-120 nm
[17, 18]. Various types of cells, particularly tumor cells,
can secrete exosomes into the extracellular matrix after
multiple intracellular vesicles fuse with the cell membrane
[17, 18]. Exosomes are found not only in serum, plasma,
and urine but also in other body fluids, such as amniotic
fluid, ascites, nasal lavage fluid, breast milk, saliva, and
cell culture media [9, 15, 19-21].
With regard to the liver, three main cell types release
exosomes (Figure 1): hepatocytes, nonparenchymal
immune cells (e.g., Kupffer cells, natural killer cells, T
cells, and B cells), and nonparenchymal liver cells (e.g.,
liver stellate cells). Exosomes derived from different

cells in the liver have different functions, for example,
exosomes derived from T cells and B cells are important
mediators of inflammation [22], and exosomes derived
from hepatic stellate cells may be involved in f﻿﻿ibrosis
processes [23].

The miRNA of exosomes is different from that of
their cells of origin. In miRNA expression profiling of
Hep3B cells containing miRNA of exosomes derived
from those cells, the expression levels of 25 miRNAs
were significantly enriched in the exosomes, whereas
those of 30 miRNAs were downregulated. Notably, 11
miRNAs were detected exclusively in the exosomes [9].
In another study of SMMC-7721 hepatocarcinoma cells,
some miRNAs, such as miR-486-5p and miR-10b-5p,
were highly abundant in exosomes but less abundant in
cellular RNAs, and let-7d-5p, let-7b-5p, and let-7c-5p,
which were highly abundant in cellular miRNAs, occurred
only in very low numbers in exosomal RNAs [36]. These
results point to selective enrichment of exosomes with
specific miRNAs in HCC cells.
Exosomal miRNAs are transferable and functional
in recipient cells. miR-122, a liver-specific miRNA that
plays various roles in liver physiology and promotes the
replication of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) [37], can be
transferred via exosomes between two human hepatoma
cell lines Huh7 and HepG2. When exosomal miR-122
released by Huh7 cells is transferred to HepG2 cells,
it reduces the growth and proliferation of recipient

FUNCTIONS OF EXOSOMES IN HCC
Exosomal miRNAs and HCC
Many studies have suggested that miRNAs
participate in the development of HCC and that they may
serve as potential prognostic or diagnostic markers for
HCC [24-31]. The expression of the miRNAs miR-21,
miR-221, and miR-222 is upregulated in HCC tissues [2729], whereas the expression of miR-122a, miR-145, miR199a, and miR-223 is downregulated, as compared to that
of normal controls [27, 30, 32]. Recent studies suggest that
exosomes may function as biological delivery vehicles
for miRNAs [9, 33-35]. The expression of miRNAs in
exosomes in HCC is shown in Table 1.

Figure 1: Generation of extracellular vesicles in liver. The main three cell-types released extracellular vesicles in liver are shown
at the top. The biogenesis of exosomes is shown at the bottom. Virus, proteins, RNAs are sorted to late endosomes, and further formatted
intraluminal vesicles(ILVs). ILVs in the multivesicular body (MVB) released to the extracellular space by an exocytic step is regarded
as exosomes (30-120nm). MVB can also be degraded as lysosomes. Ectosomes (100-350nm) and other microvesicles (100-1000nm) are
budded from plasma membrane.

cells [38]. Interestingly, exosomal miRNAs can also be
transferred between different types of cells. Exosomes
from adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADMSCs)
can transfer miR-122 to HepG2 [35]. In addition, human
and mouse liver cells, as well as primary human B cells,
can exchange cellular endogenous miRNA, mediated by
exosome shuffling [39]. miR-21, miR-192, and miR-221
in exosomes derived from colorectal cancer cell lines can
be transferred to HepG2 cells and A549 lung cancer cells
[33]. These findings indicate that miRNAs can shuttle
between cells via exosomes, potentially promoting the
invasion and metastasis of HCC.
Following the transfer of exosomal miRNAs to
recipient cells, they regulate the target gene expression
of recipient cells. miR-122-transfected ADMSCs can
effectively package miR-122 into secreted exosomes and
then deliver it to HCC cells, thereby altering the expression
of miR-122 target genes, such as cyclin G1 and insulinlike growth factor receptor 1 in hepatoma cells [35]. In a
previous study, the recurrence of HCC was higher in HCC
liver transplantation patients with reduced expression of
serum exosomal miR-718 [40]. The authors attributed the
increased recurrence to miR-718 markedly suppressing the
proliferation of Huh7 cells by upregulating the expression
of the HOXB8 gene.

in exosomes [51, 52].The involvement of lipid-mediated
RNA loading in exosomes has been demonstrated [53].
ELAVL1 is a member of the ELAVL family of RBPs. It
directly interacts with long noncoding RNA (lncRNA), a
target of miRNA, in HCC cells [54]. Ahadi et al. identified
ELAVL1 motifs on exosomal lncRNAs, suggesting
that ELAVL1 may also stabilize the transcript [55]. In
addition, Schilders et al. [56] demonstrated that M-phase
phosphoprotein 6 is an exosome-associated RBP for
the recruitment of the exosome to pre-rRNA. Thus, the
literature suggests that miRNA loading of exosomes may
be based on the interaction of the RBP-RNA complex.
Research has also shown that replication of the HCV was
associated with the Ago2-HSP90-miR-122 complex in
exosomes isolated from HCV patients or HCV-infected
Huh7.5 cells [51]. Thus, based on the current literature,
RBPs not only mediate the loading of miRNAs into
exosomes, they also play critical roles in stabilizing these
miRNAs in exosomes.

Exosome-mediated invasion and metastasis
Tumor metastasis is a multistep process, which
includes invasion, intravasation, and colonization of
distal sites via the circulatory system [57]. The tumor
microenvironment allows for tight integration of these
processes [58]. Cancer-derived exosomes provide a means
of cell-cell communication between cancer cells and may
possibly recruit and reprogram the constituents of the
tumor microenvironment [57]. The contents of exosomes,
such as noncoding RNAs and proteins, may then influence
cancer progression and metastasis [59].
Cellular TGF-beta-activated kinase 1 (TAK1)
responds to environmental changes and intercellular
modulation and is thought to contribute to the formation
and growth of HCC [60]. In Hep3B cells, miRNAs
are released into exosomes via a ceramide-dependent
pathway, transferred to recipient cells, and then modulate
the constitutive expression of TAK1 and downstream
signaling associated with TAK1 in recipient cells [9].
Following the incubation of Hep3B and HepG2 with
Hep3B-derived exosomes, the number of colonies of
Hep3B and HepG2 cells in soft agar increasedFollowing
ia, as well as the activity of caspase-3/7, indicating that
exosomes have a positive effect on transformed cell
growth and death in vitro [9]. CD90+ cancer stem cells
are associated with metastasis and early recurrence in
HCC [61, 62]. A previous study showed that CD90+
Huh7 cells derived from exosomes influenced the tumor
microenvironment by promoting angiogenesis [63]. In
that study, when endothelial cells were incubated with
exosomes released by CD90+ Huh7 cells, the mRNA
levels of the proangiogenic factor vascular endothelial
growth factor (VEGF) and its receptor VEGF-R1
increased significantly in endothelial cells, in addition to
adhesion between the CD90+ cells and endothelial cells.

Exosomal proteomes and HCC
The content of exosomal proteins of hepatic cancer
cell lines differs greatly, depending on their metastatic
potential (high vs. low). In a quantitative analysis, specific
proteins enriched in hepatocyte-derived exosomes
included caveolae (caveolin 1), early endosomes,
endoplasmic reticulum proteins, peroxisomes and
mitochondria [41, 42]. Using mass spectrometry analysis,
213 unique proteins were detected in HCC-derived
exosomes [43]. In the same study, a proteomic analysis
revealed that the MET protein, caveolins, and S100
family members were significantly enriched in exosomes
secreted by highly malignant HCC cells. Another study
confirmed that the abundance of exosomal S100 family
members, S100-A8 and S100-A9, significantly increased
in response to HBV transfection in Huh-7 cells [44].
However, as shown by exosomal proteome profiling, the
expression of these proteins does not seem to be specific
to HCC. For example, the S100 protein is found in
exosomes secreted from breast cancer cells [45], caveolin
1 is found in glioma [46], and MET is found in colorectal
cancer cells [10]. MET signaling, caveolins and S100
family members are known to have pivotal roles in tumor
growth, angiogenesis, and metastasis [47-49]. Thus, these
exosomal proteomes could be common targets for the
treatment of various types of cancer.
RNA binding proteins (RBPs) act as miRNA carriers
in cells [50]. Intriguingly, some RBPs, such as highdensity lipoproteins and argonaute-2 (Ago2), are present

be delivered to uninfected cells via exosomes [67]. The
HIV accessory protein negative factor stimulates its
own export by releasing exosomes [68]. Hepatitis virus
infection is a major cause of HCC. Upon release from
host cells, the hepatitis A virus cloaks itself in exosomes,
thereby protecting the virion from antibody-mediated
neutralization [69]. Similarly, the release of HCV from
infected cells is linked to the exosomal pathway [70],
and exosomes from HCV-infected cells are capable of
transmitting infection to naive human hepatoma Huh7.5.1
cells [71]. Interestingly, levels of extracellular infectious
HCV are significantly lower in exosomes released from
autophagy knockdown cells [72]. The aforementioned
sheds light on the potential role of the exosomal pathway
as an immune evasion mechanism, enabling the hepatitis
virus to replicate efficiently in the liver. Studies of HBV
virion morphogenesis and secretion in HBV-infected
hepatocytes demonstrated that multivesicular bodies and
related cellular proteins were significantly involved in this
process. Although HBV infection is known to alter the
contents of exosomes [73], exosome-mediated immune
mechanisms in HBV infection and HBV-related HCC
remain unclear. Further research is needed on exosomal
HBV miRNA and miRNA transport in HBV infection.

However, the aforementioned effects were not observed in
exosomes released by Huh7 parental cells. Furthermore,
H19, an lncRNA, was up-regulated (10-fold) in the
exosomes derived from the CD90+ Huh7 cells compared
with those derived from Huh7, suggesting that H19
lncRNA might stimulate angiogenesis and favor cell-cell
interactions [63].
In common with noncoding RNAs, exosomal
proteomes can promote the migration of cancer cells.
Vasorin, a serum biomarker of hepatocarcinoma that
is highly expressed in sera and tissues samples of
hepatocarcinoma [64], is released by HepG2 cells in
exosomes. Upon delivery of vasorin to human umbilical
vein endothelial cells via exosomes, vasorin accelerates
the migration of these cells [65]. In an immortalized
hepatocyte line, the MET protein, caveolins, and S100
family members in HCC-derived exosomes triggered
PI3K/AKT and MAPK signaling pathways and increased
the secretion of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) and
MMP-9, thereby facilitating the invasion activity of cancer
cells [43].

Exosome-mediated immune evasion
Viral miRNA or proteins can also be packaged
into exosomes [66]. Epstein-Barr virus miRNAs can

APPLICATIONS OF EXOSOMES IN HCC

Exosomes as therapeutic tools
The function of exosomes as vehicles for the
delivery of proteins and antigen chaperones illustrate their
potential in immunotherapy of HCC [78]. For example,
human macrophages can transfer miR-142 and miR-223
to HCC cells, decrease the expression of reporter proteins,
and endogenously express stathmin-1 and the insulinlike growth factor-1 receptor, further inhibiting HCC cell
proliferation or tumor growth [79]. Bone marrow stromal
cells pulsed with homologous tumor-derived exosomes
can increase the inhibition of homologous HCC H(22)
cells, resulting in the arrest of H(22) cells in the G(0)/G(1)
phase [80]. Exosomal proteins are actively released after
stimulation. NY-ESO-1 is a tumor-specific antigen, with
strong antigen immunogenicity [81]. The expression of
the NY-ESO-1 protein in exosomes derived from HCC
cell lines, as well as the expression of human leukocyte
antigen, a tumor-specific immune-stimulating molecule,
increases significantly after 5-Aza-2’-deoxycytidine
treatment, indicating that exosomes secreted from
hepatoma cells are able to stimulate an antitumor-specific
immune response [82]. Notably, anticancer drugs also
cause the release of exosomes from human HCC cells
[83]. In vitro, after exposure to HCC cells resistant or
sensitive to anticancer drugs, exosomes with superior
immunogenicity were actively released by resistant
anticancer drug-treated HepG2 cells, eliciting effective
heat shock protein-specific natural killer cell antitumor
responses [83]. In a rat model, exosomal ADMSCs
facilitated HCC suppression by promoting NK T-cell
anti-tumor responses [84]. These findings suggest that
a vaccine that targeted exosomes could be efficient orin
HCC immunotherapy.

Exosomes for diagnosis
Exosome-associated miRNAs are more stable than
nonexosome-associated miRNAs [74]. In addition, the
expression of exosomal miRNAs is different to that of
serum circulating miRNAs [75] and protein, as well as
that of protein miRNAs [43]. Given the differences in the
expression of these miRNAs, the exosomal content of
cells can be used to aid the diagnosis of lung cancer [76],
pancreatic cancer [12], and malignant melanoma [14]. As
the miRNA and protein content of exosomes produced
by HCC cells are completely different to those of normal
cells [9, 36], with some miRNAs found only in HCCderived exosomes [9], HCC-derived exosomes may serve
as a novel diagnostic marker for HCC. Several exosomal
miRNAs, such as miR-21, miR-18a, miR-221, miR-222,
and miR-224, are candidate biomarkers [13, 15]. However,
the diagnostic efficiency of exosomal miRNAs for HCC
has not been determined. Furthermore, whether exosomal
miRNA is a better biomarker than serum α-fetoprotein
remains an intriguing topic for future investigations.

Exosomes for drug resistance
Drug resistance is a major obstacle in the treatment
of HCC, and novel strategies need to be developed to
combat drug toxicity and sensitivity in chemotherapy. In
this regard, exosomes have attracted much interest. In one
study, cisplatin enhanced cytotoxic T lymphocyte-specific
cytotoxicity elicited by exosomes when compared that
of controls, and significantly prolonged the survival time
of mice with HCC [77]. Another study proposed that
miR-122 could modulate the sensitivity of HCC cells to
chemotherapeutic drugs by downregulating multidrug
resistance-related genes, antiapoptotic genes, and the
cell cycle-related gene cyclin B1 [24]. More recently,
ADMSC-derived exosomes were shown to deliver miR122 to HCC cells [35]. In vitro, the percentage of the
G0/G1 population of HepG2 and Huh7 cells increased
significantly when incubated with chemotherapeutic
agents and/or ADMSC-derived exosomes (122-Exo)
[35]. In the same study, Huh7 cells treated with 122-Exo
showed similar G0/G1 arrest trends, and these effects
were confirmed in vivo. These findings indicate that 122Exo can enhance cell apoptosis and cell cycle arrest and
increase the chemosensitivity of HCC [35]. Based on the
literature, exosomes seems to show major promise in
combating drug resistance and sensitivity in chemotherapy
for HCC.

FUTURE PERSPECTIVES
Considerable advances have been made in
understanding the functions of exosomes in HCC (Figure
2). These advances facilitate the development of a
powerful new strategy to prevent and treat HCC. However,
to exploit the potential of HCC-derived exosomes, more
studies are needed of some specific areas, as described
below:
First, there are no current technical standards
established at present for the purification and isolation
of exosomes. For example, ectosomes, which are very
similar to exosomes, are oproduced by all cells (Figure
1). Thus, distinguishing purified and isolated exosomes
and ectosomes is problematic [18]. In addition, the
heterogeneity of exosomes (i.e., different density of
exosomes and different expression of exosomal proteomic
markers) needs to be considered as this can affect the
purification of exosomespurified [85]. Therefore, more
discriminant techniques are needed for the purification

and isolation of exosomes to obtain more homogeneous
exosomal preparations.
Second, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs)
promote tumorigenesis, progression, invasion, and
chemoresistance in the tumor microenvironment of
cancers [86]. In our previous work, we showed that CAFs,
as well as energy metabolism reprogramming and oxygen
stress, played important roles in abnormal proliferation
[87]. The progress of HCC is always associated with
CAFs [88, 89], as most cases of HCC are the result of
liver cirrhosis [90]. As HCC-derived exosomes are known
to play important roles in the tumor microenvironment,
the next challenge is to better understand the role of
HCC-derived exosomes in CAFs, energy metabolism
reprogramming, and oxygen stress.
Third, the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)
mediates HCC invasion and metastasis [91], and miRNA
inhibits the expression of proteins involved in the EMT
and promotes the EMT in cancer cells [92, 93]. The role
of exosomes in the promotion of the EMT was delineated
recently [94]. Hence, new studies could focus on the
possible role of enriched and specific miRNAs in HCCderived exosomes in the EMT.
Fourth, in addition to miRNAs, lncRNAs mediate
the progress of HCC [95]. Recent work showed that
circular RNAs functioned as miRNA sponges [96]. No
studies have investigated the functions of lncRNAs and
circular RNAs in HCC-derived exosomes. Considering the
important functions of miRNAs in exosomes from HCC
cells, further studies should investigate the potential roles
of lncRNAs and circRNAs in exosomes in HCC.
Finally, treatment based on exosomes may be a
double-edged sword, given the pro- and anticancerinducing activity of these extracellular vehicles. Therefore,
numerous large studies should evaluate the clinical
efficacy and safety of exosomes for use in the development
of a vaccine for HCC immunotherapy.

The authors declare that they have no conflict of
interest.
