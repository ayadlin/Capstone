ABSTRACT
Here we demonstrated that SKI2162, a small-molecule inhibitor of the TGF-β
type I receptor (ALK5), prevented radiation-induced fibrosis (RIF) in mice. SKI2162
inhibited phosphorylation of Smad and induction of RIF-related genes in vitro. In RIF
a mouse model, SKI2162 reduced late skin reactions and leg-contracture without
jeopardizing the acute skin reaction. Irradiation of mouse tissue increased COL1A2
mRNA levels, and topical administration of SKI2162 significantly inhibited this effect.
Thus, these findings support that SKI2162 has potential value as novel RIF-protective
agent, and could be candidate for clinical trials.

to the TGF-β type II receptor, which recruits the TGF-β
type I receptor, also known as ALK5 (activin receptor-like
kinase-5), resulting in the assembly of a heterodimeric
receptor complex [8]. This receptor complex phosphorylates
the Smad proteins; the activated Smad complex then
translocates to the nucleus where the Smad proteins bind
to their DNA binding site to initiate gene expression [8,
9]. Therefore, inhibition of the TGF-β signaling pathway
could be a very effective strategy for controlling fibrosis.
There have been numerous attempts to develop anti-fibrotic
agents targeting the TGF-β signaling pathway, including
TGF-β-neutralizing antibodies, antisense oligonucleotides
against TGF-β, and TGF-β receptor antagonists [10].
Recently, SKI2162, a novel small-molecule inhibitor
of ALK5, was synthesized. SKI2162, which competitively
inhibits the ATP binding site of ALK5 and is highly
selective for ALK5, is being developed for the treatment
of RIF. SKI2162 was also recently reported to block TGFβ1-induced phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of
Smad2 and Smad3 [11]. In the this study, we evaluated the
inhibitory effect of SKI2162 against the TGF-β signaling
pathway in vitro as well as in vivo using our previously
established RIF mouse model [6].

INTRODUCTION
Radiation therapy (RT) is among the main
cancer treatment modalities together with surgery and
chemotherapy, and about half of all newly diagnosed
patients will receive RT during the course of their disease
[1]. RT is associated with various late complications
caused by fibrosis and vascular damage, which are
regarded as the main pathological processes of the
late RT response [2–4]. Radiation-induced fibrosis
(RIF) in skin and soft tissue, which is characterized by
excessive accumulation of extracellular matrix and the
proliferation of fibroblasts, is one of the most common late
complications of RT [2, 3]. Although RIF was traditionally
regarded as an irreversible process that leads to dead
fibrous tissue, RIF is now recognized as a dynamic process
related to the remodeling of scar tissue by continuously
reactivated myofibroblasts [5].
Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) is the main
signaling molecule in fibrosis. Radiation can activate the
TGF-β signaling pathway, and continuous expression of
TGF-β has been observed in the early and late phases of
RIF [6, 7]. This signaling pathway involves TGF-β binding

Inhibitory and selectivity effects of SKI2162 on
ALK5

SKI2162 down-regulates RIF markers in
fibroblast cell

The result of assays for inhibitory and selectivity
effects of SKI2162 on ALK5 are shown in Figure 1 and
Supplementary Table 1. The IC50 values for SKI2162 and
LY2157299 were 0.094 μM and 0.327 μM, respectively,
demonstrating that SKI2162 was approximately 3-fold
more potent than LY2157299 in inhibiting ALK5 activity.
Selectivity assays of SKI2162 and LY2157299 indicated
that SKI2162 was 21-fold more selective for ALK5
inhibition than p38 MAPK inhibition, whereas LY2157299
did not discriminate between ALK5 and p38 MAPK. Both
SKI2162 and LY2157299 showed 73-fold and 40-fold
higher selectivity for ALK5 than ALK1, respectively.

To determine whether SKI2162 regulates radiationinduced TGF-β1 activation and the TGF- β1-mediated
fibrosis response, TGF-β1 mRNA expression was
evaluated in human WI38VA13 fibroblast cells by realtime PCR following irradiation (10 Gy). As shown in
Figure 3A, the level of TGF-β1 mRNA significantly
increased after irradiation in a time-dependent manner.
Due to the important role of TGF-β1 in the regulation
of fibrogenesis, the effect of SKI2162 on the radiationinduced transcription of TGF-β1-regulared genes,
particularly fibrosis genes, was evaluated using realtime PCR. As shown in Figure 3B, SKI2162 treatment
significantly reduced the radiation-induced transcriptional
expression of MMP2, MMP8, PAI-1, LOX and PLAU.
Similar results were also observed in TGF-β1-treated
HaCaT cells (Supplementary Figure 1). PAI-1 and
MMP9 were also increased by radiation at the protein
level(Supplementary Figure 2), and SKI2162 inhibited this
effect (Figure 3C).

Activation of Smad2 and Smad3 by TGF-β1 is
directly inhibited by SKI2162 in keratinocyte
and fibroblast cells
The inhibitory effects of SKI2162 on phosphorylation
of Smad proteins were evaluated in HaCaT and WI38VA13
cells by western blotting. Cells were pretreated for 1 h with
increasing concentration of SKI2162 (0, 100, 200, and
400 nM), after which TGF-β1 (5 ng/ml) was added and
the cells were incubated for 1 h. A representative western
blot of pSmad2, Smad2, pSmad3, and Smad3 are shown in
Figure 2. TGF-β1 increased the levels of phosphorylated
Smad2 and Smad3 in both cells and pre-incubation with
SKI2162 diminished their phosphorylation in response to

values were calculated to derive the corresponding IC50 values. The calculated IC50 values for SKI2162 and LY2157299 were 0.094 μM
and 0.327 μM, respectively.

was significantly greater in the SKI2162 and tocopherolpentoxifylline (PTX) treated groups than in the control
group between 6 and 16 weeks post-irradiation. Early
skin reactions were measured during the third and fourth
weeks post-irradiation. The early skin reaction grades
were almost identical among the three groups (data not
shown). Late skin reaction scores measured at 16 weeks
post-irradiation were 3.14 ± 0.08 in the control group, 2.74
± 0.11 in the tocopherol-PTX group, and 2.73 ± 0.16 in the
SKI2162 group (Figure 4B). Both treated groups showed
significantly lower levels of skin reaction than the control
group (p = 0.034 for the tocopherol-PTX group and p =
0.006 for the SKI2162 group) (Supplementary Table 2).
SKI2162 was well tolerated and neither treatment group
showed significant differences in body weight compared
with the RIF group (saline) at any post-irradiation time
point (Data not shown). To investigate the effect of
SKI2162 in the skin and soft tissue of the irradiated leg,
the epithelial thickness from the surface of the epidermis
to the base of the dermis was measured. As shown in
Figure 4C, the thickness of the epithelium was greater
in the control group (saline) than in the SKI2162 group
(479.06 ± 35.51 μm vs. 385.27 ± 15.55 μm, p = 0.035
by a one-sided test), suggesting that SKI2162 blocked
collagen accumulation and fibrotic changes. We also
checked the histology of untreated normal skin and the
epithelium thickness was 163.11 ± 16.46 μm. As shown
in H&E images (Figure 4D), radiation induced dramatic
changes especially in both epidermis and dermis compared
to normal skin and the treatment of SKI2162 ameliorated

radiation induced skin damages such as necrosis and
collagen accumulation.
To demonstrate the inhibitory role of SKI2162 in
a RIF mouse model, the expression of fibrosis-related
target genes was examined by real-time PCR using
mRNA from the legs of irradiated mice with or without
SKI2162 at 16 weeks post-irradiation. A significant
reduction in the radiation-induced transcription of
PAI-1 (p = 0.042) and SMA (p = 0.0028) were observed
following SKI2162 treatment (Figure 5A). Next, to assess
the efficacy of topical application of SKI2162, COL1A2
mRNA expression was evaluated in a RIF mouse model
(Figure 5B). A single radiation dose of 35 Gy was
delivered to the hind limb of each mouse to induce skin
fibrosis and SKI2162 (0.1% or 1.0%) or vehicle was
topically applied for 14 days post-radiation. COL1A2
mRNA levels increased in vehicle-treated mice compared
to sham-treated mice suggesting that radiation induces
up-regulation of collagen synthesis 14 day post-irradiation.
Furthermore, COL1A2 mRNA was significantly decreased
in mice treated with 1.0% SKI2162 compared to shamtreated controls (p = 0.016).

DISCUSSION
The present study showed that the activation of
the TGF-β signaling pathway by radiation, which has
been regarded as a major mechanism in the pathogenesis
of RIF, was effectively controlled by SK2162 (an ALK5
inhibitor), leading to the amelioration of RIF in a mouse

model. Among the various signaling molecules involved in
fibrosis, TGF-β1 has been described as the master switch
for the fibrotic mechanism [3–5]. TGF-β1 is a multifunctional cytokine associated with cell proliferation, cell
differentiation, cell migration, production of extracellular
material, and immune reactions; in particular, it plays a
central role in fibroblast proliferation and the production
of collagen fibers [17]. After TGF-β binds its receptor, the
activated TGF-β receptor phosphorylates the Smad proteins,
and the activated Smad complex translocates to the nucleus
where the Smad proteins bind to their DNA binding site
to initiate gene expression [5]. Notably, disruption of
the Smad3 gene in knockout mice provides significant
protection from radiation-induced skin injury [18].
It is well known that radiation can directly activate
the TGF-β signaling pathway [6, 7]. Even very lowdose radiation (0.1 Gy) can induce TGF-β activation and
radiation-induced stromal changes, and a dose-response
relationship up to 5 Gy has been observed [19]. Also,
induction of TGF-β signaling is initiated quickly after
irradiation. Martin et al. showed that induction of TGF-β
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

is detectable in skin tissue 6 h after single radiation
doses ranging from 16 to 64 Gy [20]. Moreover, TGF-β1
mRNA was overexpressed during the early erythematous
phase and activation of TGF-β1 continued from 6 to 12
months after irradiation in a porcine model of RIF. Similar
alterations have been detected as long as 27 years after
irradiation in radiation-induced human skin fibrosis [21].
These observations indicate that RIF is not a stationary
environment resulting from temporal alteration of the
normal repair mechanism, but rather a dynamic process
with vicious cycles of fibrosis and inflammation associated
with TGF-β signaling. Given that the TGF-β signaling
pathway is a central mechanism in fibrotic changes,
targeting this pathway, and thereby blocking the vicious
cycle of TGF-β1 signaling, is a reasonable strategy for
protecting against RIF.
In the present study, the TGF-β1 receptor was used
as the target for RIF protection. As shown in our study,
SKI2162, a newly developed novel small-molecule
inhibitor of the TGF-β1 receptor (ALK5) is a more
potent and selective inhibitor of the TGF-β1 receptor

than LY2157299, a potent ALK5 inhibitor that has
been used in clinical trials [12]. And our study clearly
indicated that SKI2162 blocked the TGF-β signaling
pathway and fibrosis-related gene expressions. Western
blot analyses demonstrated that phosphorylated Smad2
and Smad3, which are the activated forms of these
proteins, were decreased in a concentration-dependent
manner by SKI2162 treatment. Also, the induction of
fibrosis-related genes was significantly inhibited by
SKI2162 treatment of fibroblast cells. Additionally,
topically applied SKI2162 inhibited the induction of
COL1A2 mRNA in a RIF mouse model. Remarkably,
SKI2162 could inhibit PAI-1 expression by blocking
TGF-β signaling in irradiated cells and tissues. In
irradiated tissues, cells generate reactive oxygen species
(ROS) and elevated ROS promotes fibrogenesis via
activation of TGF-β which stimulates collagen as well
as PAI-1. PAI-1 gene expression is tightly regulated by
a variety of cytokines such as TGF-β, interleukin-1β,
and TNF-α, and the PAI-1 promoter contains important
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

regulator elements including Smad2, Smad3, CREBbinding protein (CBP) and specificity protein 1 (sp1)
[22–24]. PAI-1 is considered to be an important inhibitor
of fibrinolysis and the direct accumulation of extracelluar
matrix, which suggests it plays a pivotal role in the
development of tissue fibrosis [25].
Also, predisposing genetic factors might play major
role in the diversity of development of RIF. Several
reports showed fibrosis-related basal gene expression
level could be related with a RIF. Forrester HB et al.
compared the basal expression profiles between cell lines
of cancer patients with and without severe fibrosis using
Exon arrays. They identified candidate genes related with
RIF prediction and these genes are associated with TGF-β
and retinoic acid which have a role in the fibrogenic
process [28]. Andreassen CN et al. conducted study for
validation of a previously established predictive test for
the risk of RIF based on the gene expression pattern. They
classified 160 patients with head and neck cancer who
received RT into sensitive or resistant expression profile.

administration of SKI2162 (1.0%) significantly repressed the induction of COL1A2 mRNA in a RIF mouse model (*p < 0.05 vs. control).

The cumulative risk of fibrosis was 34% at 9 years for the
patients with sensitive profile opposed to 0% for resistant
profile [29].
The in vivo efficacy of SKI2162 was confirmed in
a RIF mouse model. The leg-contracture assay showed
a significant protective effect in the SKI2162 treatment
group in the 16 weeks after irradiation. This finding
suggested that TGF-β1-related dynamic processes of
fibrosis might continue in the control group up to 4
months post-irradiation and SKI2162 showed a continuous
protective effect during the same period. These results are
in agreement with our previous finding that increased
TGF-β mRNA could be detected in irradiated tissue up to
3 months post-irradiation [6]. Also, although SKI2162 had
no significant effects on acute skin reactions, the SKI2162
treatment group showed a significantly lower level of late
skin reactions than the control group. This suggests that
inhibition of the TGF-β signaling pathway by SKI2162
has a more potent effect on the late phase of fibrosis
than on the initial phase. We also tested the possibility
of topical application of SKI2162 in radiation-induced
fibrosis mouse model. However it takes several months
to develop skin fibrosis, we simply modified irradiation
schedule to mimic similar skin condition. Single radiation
dose of 35 Gy was delivered to induce the increased
gene expression of COL1A2 and topical treatment of
1% SKI2162 for 14 days completely inhibited COL1A2
induction compared to sham-treated control. Even though
RIF is considered as long-term process, this experiment
could provide meaningful information.

Vitamin E (Vit E) plus PTX is one of the most widely
studied anti-fibrotic treatment regimens for superficial
fibrotic lesions [13]. In one randomized, placebo-controlled
clinical trial, Vit E plus PTX was reported to significantly
reduce RIF in patients who had received RT for breast cancer
[26]. In the current study, we confirmed the antifibrotic effect
of Vit E plus PTX in the RIF mouse model, showing that
radiation-induced leg contracture was significantly reduced
in the Vit E plus PTX-treated group from 6 to 16 weeks postirradiation. The Vit E plus PTX-treated group also showed
more favorable late skin reactions than the control group
(Supplementary Figure 4). Although a comparison showed
a trend toward greater protection by SKI2162, the difference
between the protective effect of SKI2162 and Vit E plus
PTX was not significantly different. Several molecular
mechanisms for the effect of Vit E and PTX were suggested,
but exact mode of action of these agents is unknown.
Recently, Hamama S et al. investigated the activation of
the TGF-β/Smad and Rho/ROCK pathways using primary
smooth muscle cells isolated from intestinal samples from
humans with radiation enteropathy which were incubated
with Vit E and PTX. Hamama S et al. showed that PTX
and Vit E suppress fibrogenic action by inhibition of TGF-β
transcription, not by Rho/ROCK pathway [27].
Although the TGF-β signaling pathway is related to
exaggerated fibrotic changes, basically, it normally serves
a major healing function in tissue injury. Accordingly, we
were initially concerned about the possibility that inhibition
of TGF-β signaling by SKI2162 might negatively affect
healing during the acute skin reaction. However, because
4176

Oncotarget

induction of the TGF-β signal starts immediately after
radiation (Supplementary Figure 5) [20], we assumed that
immediate SKI2162 treatment would be more effective
and chose not to delay SKI2162 treatment. Contrary to
our worst-case expectations, skin-reaction scoring showed
no difference in acute skin reactions between the SKI2162
treated group and the control group. One interpretation of
these results is that TGF-β signaling through ALK5 does not
entirely account for the normal healing mechanism. TGF-β
could act through multiple pathways to regulate healing
process, and there is the possibility of cross-talk between the
TGF-β signaling pathway and other signaling pathway [30].
Another concern associated with inhibition of the TGF-β
pathway for RIF protection is adverse systemic effects.
TGF-β is a highly pleiotropic cytokine that contributes to
various essential functions including apoptosis control,
angiogenesis, wound healing, and immune regulation
[31]. Although, we used systemic delivery of SKI2162
(intraperitoneal injection) in the leg-contracture assays to
maximize drug effects for validation purpose, there were no
definite toxic effects related to drug administration in the
RIF mouse model. However, there remains a need for further
study about possible toxic effect associated with this agent.
For assessment of anti-fibrotic treatment, it is
important to demonstrate this therapeutic effect in vivo
because the effect of anti-fibrotic treatment at the
molecular level may not translate into clinical effect. In the
present study, we performed a leg-contracture assay using
a Lucite jig, which is an effective, widely accepted method
for measuring RIF in mouse models and has an accuracy
of 1 ± 0.5 mm [15, 16]. However, results obtained using
this method could confounded by inter-observer variation
because the measurement of the leg-contracture using a
Lucite jig depends on the operator’s skill. Although, to
minimize error, only one investigator (J. Park) performed
this assay with blinded method, a reliable and objective
measurement method must be developed for the study of
anti-fibrotic therapy.
In conclusion, we assessed the inhibitory effect of
SKI2162, a newly developed small-molecule inhibitor
of the TGF-β1 type I receptor (ALK5), and assessed its
protective effect against RIF using in vivo and in vitro
models. Although many TGF-β receptor-antagonizing
drugs have been tested, to the best of our knowledge,
the current study is the first report of a small-molecule
inhibitor of the TGF-β1 receptor that protects against
RIF in a mouse model. SKI2162 could be considered a
candidate for future clinical trials of RIF.

The kinase activity of ALK5, ALK1, and p38 MAPK
were assessed by measuring radiolabelled phosphate
(33P) incorporation into casein. ALK1 and p38 MAPK are
closely related to ALK5, and were used for comparison
with ALK5 in a SKI2162 selectivity study. IC50 values
were calculated from dose–response curves.

Western blot analysis
Cell culture and reagents are shown in Figures
and Supplementary Figures. To assess the effect of
SKI2162 on TGF-β1-induced activation of Smad2 and
Smad3, HaCaT and WI38VA13 cells were pretreated
with increasing concentrations of SKI2162 for 1 h and
then TGF-β1 (5 ng/ml) was added for an additional
hour. Cell extracts were lysed with lysis buffer and
protein expression was detected by conventional western
blot analysis. Anti-phospho-Smad2 (Ser465/467),
anti-Smad2, anti-phospho-Smad3 (Ser423/425), antiSmad3, TGF-β Type I receptor and anti-phospho-TGF-β
Type I receptor antibodies were used (Cell Signaling
Technology, USA). In addition, WI38VA13 cells were
pretreated with 200 nM of SKI2162 for 1 h and then
irradiated (10 Gy) using a linear accelerator (Varian
Medical Systems, USA). Cells were incubated for
48 and 72 h and then analyzed by western blot using
plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) and matrix
metalloproteinase (MMP)9 antibodies (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, USA).

RNA extraction and real-time PCR
The expression of fibrosis-related genes, including
MMP2, MMP8, MMP9, PAI-1, lysil oxydase (LOX)
and urokinase plasminogen activator gene (PLAU), was
measured by real-time PCR following radiation and
SKI2162 treatment. WI38VA13 cells were pretreated with
or without 200 nM of SKI2162 for 1 h and then irradiated
(10 Gy). More detailed method for measurement is shown
in Figure 3B.

Anti-fibrotic effect of SKI2162 in a RIF mouse
model
Male BALB/c mice (Central Laboratory Animal,
Korea) were used for the RIF mouse model [6]. Under
anesthesia, the left hind limb of each mouse received
two weekly radiation doses of 22 Gy using a linear
accelerator. After irradiation, mice were randomly
divided into three groups. Each group was treated with
once-daily (5 times/week) intraperitoneal injections of
saline (n = 20), SKI2162 (n = 21; 10 mg/kg), or PTX
(n = 20; 30 mg/kg, Sigma-Aldrich, USA) plus orally
administered tocopherol (DL-alpha-tocopherol; 10 mg/
kg; Shinil Pharmaceutical Co., Korea). All treatments
were initiated after irradiation and continued for

16  weeks. Tocopherol-PTX is one of the most widely
studied anti-fibrotic regimens [13]. The early skin
reaction was measured at 3–4-day intervals during
4 weeks after the initial irradiation, and the late skin
reaction was evaluated 16 weeks after irradiation. Early
and late skin reactions were scored using a grading
system (supplementary table 2) described by Dion et al
[14]. To assess RIF in mouse model, Lucite jig which
was modified from the one described by Stone [15].
The leg-contracture assay was performed as described
by Ishii [16], every 2 weeks for 6–16 weeks after
irradiation. Briefly, an anesthetized mouse was placed
in a Lucite jig, and the length of the extended leg was
measured with a ruler inlaid within the base of the jig.
The degree of contraction was recorded as the length of
the irradiated leg which compared with that of the unirradiated contralateral leg, expressed as a percentage
(Supplementary Figure  3). Mice were sacrificed for
histopathologic evaluation and measurement of fibrosisrelated gene expression 16 weeks after radiation. More
detailed method for measurement is shown in Figure 4A.

The effect of topically applied SKI2162 was also
tested in a RIF mice model. In this experiment, one
radiation treatment of 35 Gy was administered, and the
other conditions were the same as previously described.
After irradiation, a total of 18 mice were randomly divided
into three groups: a low-dose SKI2162 group (0.1%, n =
6), a high dose SKI2162 group (1.0%, n = 6), and a vehicle
control (n = 6). Two mice that received no radiation or
treatment were used as a sham control group. Vehicle
only (95% propylene glycol, 5% polyethylene glycol) or
SKI2162 (0.1% or 1% in vehicle) was topically administered
twice daily at 12 h intervals to the site of radiation. On day
14, the skin was excised and total RNA was extracted using

Statistical analysis
All values are presented as means ± standard errors
of mean (SEM). Significance was analyzed using the
Student’s t-test and the Mann-Whitney test. Probability
(p) values < 0.05 were considered to indicate significant
differences.
