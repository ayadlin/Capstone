Abstract
Tamoxifen resistance is one of the overarching challenges in the treatment of patients with estrogen receptor (ER)–positive breast cancer. Through a genome-wide RNA interference screen to discover genes responsible for tamoxifen resistance in vitro, we identified insulin-like growth factor binding protein 5 (IGFBP5) as a
determinant of drug sensitivity. Specific knockdown of IGFBP5 by retroviral infection with short hairpin RNA–
expressing cassette in MCF7 human breast cancer cells (pRS-shIGFBP5) conferred tamoxifen resistance
in vitro due to concomitant loss of ERα expression and signaling. IGFBP5 expression was also reduced in
MCF7 cells selected for tamoxifen resistance in culture (TAMR). Both tamoxifen-resistant MCF7-TAMR and
MCF7-pRS-shIGFBP5 cells could be resensitized to drug by treatment with exogenous recombinant IGFBP5
(rIGFBP5) protein. Treatment with rIGFBP5 protein in mouse tumor xenografts reversed the in vivo tamoxifen
resistance of MCF7-pRS-shIGFBP5 cell–derived tumors by reducing tumor cell proliferation. IGFBP5 immunohistochemical staining in a cohort of 153 breast cancer patients showed that low IGFBP5 expression was
associated with shorter overall survival after tamoxifen therapy. Thus, IGFBP5 warrants investigation as an
agent to reverse tamoxifen resistance. Cancer Res; 70(8); 3013–9. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Tamoxifen, a selective estrogen receptor (ER) modulator,
is the most widely used chemotherapeutic in the treatment
of ER-positive breast cancer (1). In spite of this, intrinsic and
acquired resistance remains the main challenge to effective
treatment with tamoxifen (2).
Antitumor effects of tamoxifen are mediated by competitive inhibition of estrogen binding to ERs (3), resulting in inhibition of estrogen-regulated genes including growth and
angiogenic factors and cell cycle arrest (4) or induction of
programmed cell death (5). ER loss of expression, mutation,
and phosphorylation, overexpression of growth factor receptors [epidermal growth factor receptor, human epidermal
growth factor receptor 2, and insulin-like growth factor receptor I (IGF-RI)], and activation of their downstream effectors
[Akt/PKB, extracellular signal–regulated kinase (ERK)-1/2,
and p38] and adaptors (Cas, c-Src, and BCAR-3) have been reported to be associated with tamoxifen resistance (2). NeverAuthors' Affiliations: Departments of 1 Biochemistry and Molecular

theless, underlying mechanisms are poorly understood and
few strategies have found success in the clinic in circumventing tamoxifen resistance. Therefore, the identification of new
genes involved in tamoxifen resistance is an essential step
toward improving breast cancer patient survival.
We performed an unbiased loss-of-function genetic screen
on MCF7 human breast cancer cells using a short hairpin
RNA (shRNA) library that identified insulin-like growth factor
binding protein 5 (IGFBP5) as a modulator of tamoxifen sensitivity in vivo, thus revealing a new strategy for reversal of
tamoxifen resistance.

Materials and Methods
Materials. MCF7 cells (American Tissue Culture Collection) were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal
bovine serum. Tamoxifen-resistant MCF7 cells (MCF7TAMR) were derived by culturing for 4 wk in 10 μmol/L
trans-4-hydroxytamoxifen (6). pRetroSuper (pRS; Origene)infected and pRS vector expressing shRNA for IGFBP5
knockdown (pRS-shIGFBP5)–infected MCF7 cells (MCF7pRS and MCF7-pRS-shIGFBP5, respectively) were maintained in media with 1.0 μg/mL puromycin.
shRNA library screening. Three shRNA oligonucleotides
against each of 8,000 genes were designed and cloned into retroviral vector (pRS) containing a shRNA expression cassette (7).
MCF7 cells were infected with pRS-shRNA library or pRS or mock
infected, selected with puromycin (1.0 μg/mL) for 2 wk, and cultured in the presence or absence of tamoxifen (5 μmol/L). After

antibodies. IGFBP5 was classified as either high or low expression based on evaluation of cytoplasmic expression level by
pathologists blinded to outcome.
Statistical analysis. Single-group comparisons were done
with two-tailed Student's t tests. Overall survival was assessed using Kaplan-Meier survival curves with log-rank
analysis and hazard ratio (HR) values were calculated using
Cox proportional hazard model.

Results
shRNA screen identifies genes involved in tamoxifen resistance. Approximately 30% of ER-positive breast cancers
do not respond to tamoxifen therapy and the majority that
initially respond develop resistance despite continued ER expression (8, 9). The identification of new genes involved in
drug resistance has been expedited by functional genetic
screens (10). To identify new genes involved in tamoxifen resistance, a loss-of-function genetic screen was done. pRSshRNA library or pRS stably infected MCF7 cells were cultured
in the presence of tamoxifen (5 μmol/L) for 6 days, chosen
because of drug sensitivity (Fig. 1A). Three successive rounds
of screening led to the identification of shRNA for IGFBP5
(shIGFBP5), present in tamoxifen-resistant shRNA library–
infected cells after each round (Fig. 1B) and for seven other
genes under investigation. An increase in viability of shRNA

library–infected cells was observed with 4- and 6-day tamoxifen treatments after second and third screenings, using WST1
(Fig. 1C) and crystal violet staining (Fig. 1D) assays. IGFBP5 is
known to negatively regulate the IGF-I signaling pathway by
inhibiting IGF-I interaction with IGF-IR (11). As IGF-I signaling is associated with aggressive phenotypes in breast cancer
(11), IGFBP5 was chosen for further investigation.
Exogenous rIGFBP5 reverses in vitro tamoxifen resistance
induced by IGFBP5 suppression. IGFBP5 mRNA transcripts
were absent in MCF7-pRS-shIGFBP5 cells as compared with
MCF7-pRS cells (Fig. 2A), leading to resistance to tamoxifen
treatment in vitro (Fig. 2B). Tamoxifen-resistant MCF7-TAMR
cells (6) also showed reduced IGFBP5 expression (Fig. 2D) associated with increased viability during tamoxifen treatment
(Fig. 2D; Supplementary Fig. S1). As IGFBP5 is a secreted protein
(11), we examined the possibility that exogenous treatment with
rIGFBP5 could restore sensitivity to drug. In MCF7-pRSshIGFBP5 (Fig. 2B) and MCF7-TAMR cells (Fig. 2C), treatment
with 5 μg/mL rIGFBP5, chosen because of sensitivity (Supplementary Fig. S2), restored tamoxifen sensitivity. IGFBP5 and
ERα expression is lost in MCF7-pRS-shIGFBP5 cells (Fig. 2A) regardless of tamoxifen and rIGFBP5 treatments (Supplementary
Fig. S3). Whereas E2 and tamoxifen had no effect on IGFBP5
expression in MCF7-pRS or MCF7-pRS-shIGFBP5 cells (Supplementary Fig. S4), E2 attenuated reduction in viability of MCF7pRS cells by tamoxifen (Supplementary Fig. S5) and induced
phosphorylation of ERK1 in tamoxifen-treated or untreated

downstream ER signaling was absent in E2- and tamoxifen-treated

through loss of ERα expression, whereas exogenous rIGFBP5

cell–derived tumors showed significant decreases in tumor
growth after tamoxifen treatments [Fig. 3A, a versus b; P <
0.05], MCF7-pRS-shIGFBP5 cell–derived tumors, which had
similar tumor growth to untreated MCF7-pRS cell–derived
tumors (a versus d), showed no decrease in tumor growth
after tamoxifen treatments as compared with untreated controls (d versus e) and had increased tumor growth after tamoxifen treatments as compared with tamoxifen-treated
MCF7-pRS cell–derived tumors (e versus b, P < 0.05). Treatment of MCF7-pRS cell–derived, but not of MCF7-pRSshIGFBP5 cell–derived, tumors with rIGFBP5 alone resulted
in a modest reduction in tumor growth (a versus c, d versus f;
P < 0.05). Cotreatment of MCF7-pRS-shIGFBP5 cell–derived
tumors with tamoxifen and rIGFBP5 resulted in an additional
reduction in tumor growth compared with tumors treated with
rIGFBP5 alone (f versus g; P < 0.05) and restored tamoxifen
sensitivity of MCF7-pRS-shIGFBP5 cell–derived tumors compared with tumors treated with tamoxifen alone (e versus g;
P < 0.05). Similar to in vitro IGFBP5 expression (Supplementary

tumors led to confirmation of corresponding presence and

absence of IGFBP5 in MCF7-pRS and MCF7-pRS-shIGFBP5
cell–derived tumors, respectively, regardless of treatments
(Fig. 3B, top row).
MCF7-pRS or MCF7-pRS-shIGFBP5 cell–derived tumors
showed positive staining for the cell proliferation marker
phosphohistone-H3, which was similar in the presence or absence of tamoxifen treatment alone (Fig. 3B, second row; 3C,
a versus b, d versus e). Similar levels of phosphohistone-H3
were also observed for MCF7-pRS cell–derived tumors treated with rIGFBP5 alone, but were reduced for MCF7-pRSshIGFBP5 cell–derived tumors treated with rIGFBP5 alone
(a versus c, d versus f; P < 0.05). On the other hand, MCF7pRS cell–derived tumors showed positive staining for the
apoptosis marker cleaved caspase-3 and areas of apoptotic
cells identified by TUNEL staining, which were both significantly higher with tamoxifen treatment alone than in untreated MCF7-pRS (P < 0.001 for cleaved caspase-3, P < 0.05
for TUNEL) and tamoxifen-treated MCF7-pRS-shIGFBP5 (P <
0.01 for cleaved caspase-3, P < 0.05 for TUNEL) cell–derived

cell–derived tumors (a versus c). This increase in apoptosis
levels was not observed in MCF7-pRS-shIGFBP5 cell–derived tumors treated with tamoxifen alone or rIGFBP5 alone (d versus e,
d versus f) or in MCF7-pRS cell–derived tumors. Cotreatment of
MCF7-pRS-shIGFBP5 cell–derived tumors with tamoxifen and
rIGFBP5 resulted in a reduction in phosphohistone-H3–positive
staining compared with treatment with tamoxifen alone (Fig. 3B,
second row; 3C, e versus g; P < 0.01), but not compared with
treatment with IGFBP5 alone (f versus g). On the other hand,
no changes in cleaved caspase-3 or TUNEL staining were observed (Fig. 3B, third row; 3C, e versus g, f versus g). The differential effects of endogenous IGFBP5 and exogenous
rIGFBP5 on tumor growth, cell proliferation, and tamoxifenmediated apoptosis in tamoxifen-treated tumors are due to
different concentrations, sites of action (intracellular versus
extracellular; ref. 11), and tamoxifen-independent and tamoxifendependent effects of endogenous and exogenous IGFBP5. Therefore, tamoxifen induces apoptosis in drug-sensitive ER-expressing
tumors; suppression of endogenous IGFBP5 induces tamoxifen
resistance due to concomitant ER loss; and exogenous rIGFBP5
cotreatment can reverse tamoxifen resistance through ERindependent mechanisms involving both tamoxifen-independent
and tamoxifen-dependent components in arresting growth.
IGFBP5 expression positively correlates with tamoxifen
response in breast cancer patients. The clinical relevance of
our observations was examined by immunohistochemical
analysis of IGFBP5 expression in human breast cancer tissue
from a cohort of 153 patients treated previously with tamoxifen (Supplementary Table S2). Of the 105 cases available for
analysis, 46 (44%) had low and 59 (56%) had high IGFBP5 expression (Fig. 4A). Cases with low IGFBP5 expression had a
reduced mean overall survival (P = 0.008) of 63 months (95%
CI, 47–79 months) compared with 101.7 months (95% CI, 83–
121 months). Expression of IGFBP5 was independently associated with survival (HR, 0.45; P = 0.025) correcting for ER
status (HR, 0.249; P = 0.006), lymph node status (HR, 5.4;
P < 0.001), size (HR, 1.7; P < 0.001), and grade (HR, 1.44;
P = 0.17). Despite our in vitro evidence showing that concomitant loss of ER expression after IGFBP5 suppression underlies
tamoxifen resistance, IGFBP5 expression was not associated
with grade, ER status, size, or lymph node status. However,
IGFBP5 low-expressing tumors were significantly larger than
high-expressing tumors (mean size, 2.77 versus 2.04 cm; P <
0.01). These data lend credence to our in vitro studies pointing
to the importance of IGFBP5 in tamoxifen resistance.

Discussion
Intracellular IGFBP5 in breast cancer cells has potent antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects (12), whereas the

effects of exogenous IGFBP5 are contradictory (13–15). Exogenous IGFBP5 had no effect on IGF-I–stimulated DNA synthesis (13), protected from ceramide-induced apoptosis
(14), or resensitized cells to the growth inhibitory effects of
tumor necrosis factor α (15). Downregulation of IGFBP5 is
associated with E2-induced growth stimulation of breast cancer
cells (16). We observed tamoxifen resistance due to suppression of endogenous IGFBP5 in MCF7 cells and concomitant
loss of ER expression, which could be reversed by exogenous
rIGFBP5 in vitro and in vivo, through tamoxifen-independent
and tamoxifen-dependent growth arrest, but not restoration of
ER expression. The differential effects of exogenous and endogenous IGFBP5 on tumor growth were also due to different
concentrations and sites of action (11).
IGFBP5 expression has been associated with ER status and
metastasis in breast cancer (17). We found that low IGFBP5
expression was associated with shorter overall survival, providing further evidence that IGFBP5 is involved in tamoxifen
resistance. Although ER status was not associated with
IGFBP5 expression in the current study, this may be owing
to the low proportion of ER-negative patients (7.8%) in the
cohort of patients (Supplementary Table S2). Precedent
comes from microarray data showing that relative IGFBP5
expression level determines tamoxifen responsiveness (18).
The variegated effects of IGFBP5 could be due to differential
cellular localization, IGF-I signaling pathway status, IGF-I–
independent effects, or alterations in cross talk between
IGF-I and ER signaling (11, 19, 20). In conclusion, our findings
reveal IGFBP5 as a potential therapeutic in managing tamoxifen resistance in breast cancer.
