ABSTRACT
The failure of apoptosis may contribute to the formation of cancer and to its
resistance to therapy. Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is an aggressive tumor
that responds poorly to standard chemo- and radio-therapies. Several studies have
demonstrated that a plethora of oncogenes and tumor suppressors contribute to MPM
onset/progression. Importantly, most of these genes are involved in the regulation
of calcium (Ca2+)-handling. Cellular Ca2+ signaling is an important regulator of many
physiological processes, and it has been widely reported to participate in the regulation
of apoptotic cell death in cancer cells and tissues. However, in MPM the role of cellular
Ca2+ has been poorly investigated. Therefore, we examined whether Ca2+ is involved
in MPM. We found that mesothelioma cell lines and short-term cultures obtained
from MPM-affected patients exhibited a critical dysregulation in Ca2+ signaling. We
determined that this characteristic was associated with resistance to apoptotic stimuli
and that correction of intracellular Ca2+ signaling resulted in the rescue of efficient
apoptotic responses. In addition, we discovered that mitochondrial Ca2+-uptake plays
a pivotal role as an inducer of apoptosis in MPM. Altogether, these findings suggest
the identification of new MPM markers, which in turn could be potential targets for
new therapeutic approaches.

Specifically, evidence indicates that both Ca2+ release from
intracellular pools and capacitative Ca2+ influx through
Ca2+ release-activated Ca2+ channels are sufficient to
trigger apoptosis [8–12]. Additionally, mitochondria play
a critical role in Ca2+ homeostasis and apoptosis [13, 14].
In conjunction with incremental changes in the cytosolic
Ca2+ levels, similar or even larger levels of mitochondrial
Ca2+ ([Ca2+]m) uptake have been observed [15]. [Ca2+]m
overload is a pro-apoptotic mechanism that induces
mitochondrial swelling, which perturbs or ruptures the
outer mitochondrial membrane, inducing the release of
mitochondrial apoptotic factors into the cytosol [16, 17].
A large body of evidence has indicated the potential
role of Ca2+ in the onset or progression of cancer,

INTRODUCTION
Human malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM)
is a highly aggressive neoplasm that leads to patient
death within a few months or years [1–3]. Presently, no
standard curative therapy exists for MPM, and there are
no recognized specific markers for the diagnosis of MPM.
In addition, little is known regarding the apparent lack of
apoptosis in mesothelioma cells [3–5].
Apoptosis is a highly tuned mechanism that
is regulated by distinct and complex pathways. This
process can be induced by a variety of physiological and
pharmacological stimuli [6], including changes in the
Ca2+ distribution within intracellular compartments [7].

compartment, we monitored the Ca2+ concentrations in
the cytosol ([Ca2+]c). In MPM cells, the [Ca2+]c increases
were significantly smaller than those in control cells
(Figure 1C–1D). Given that the concentrations of Ca2+
in the mitochondria and cytosol are highly dependent
on the amount of Ca2+ in the ER, we investigated the
Ca2+ concentrations in the ER compartment [Ca2+]ER. We
found that the steady state [Ca2+]ER in the mesothelioma
cell was markedly lower than in HMC controls
(Figure 1E–1F).
The ER constitutes the principal Ca2+ store and
participates in the initial rapid increase in [Ca2+]c by
supplying Ca2+ via the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate recep­
tors (ITPRs). The ER also participates in the subsequent
decrease in [Ca2+]c by removing Ca2+ from the cytoplasm
and recovering the internal Ca2+ stores through the action
of sarco- and endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPases
(ATP2A2). It is clear that ATP2A2 pumps are the principal
regulator for the maintenance of [Ca2+]ER. One of the most
common compounds used to induce intracellular Ca2+
accumulation, the sesquiterpene thapsigargin (TG), is a
specific and potent inhibitor of ATP2A2. Taking advantage
of this feature, we decided to evaluate the native store
filling of the ER compartment in normal and mesothelioma
cells. Cells were loaded in Ca2+-free medium with the
Ca2+-indicator Fura-2-acetoxymethylester (FURA-2/AM)
for 30 min, and the levels of the thapsigargin-releasable
Ca2+ were assessed. We found that in MPM cells, the
thapsigargin-dependent intracellular Ca2+ elevation was
significantly lower when compared with those observed
in HMC cells (Supplementary Figure S1C–1D). These
results suggest that the native store filling of the ER may
be seriously affected. As yet reported, the amplitude of
the ER-Ca2+ transient is regulated by different ER-resident
protein, such as ATP2A2 and ITPR3. For these reasons,
we investigate whether the alteration in Ca2+ handling
could be due to a change in the expression of an ER-Ca2+
binding proteins.
Interestingly, we found that in MPM cells, the
levels of the ATP2A2 and ITPR3 proteins were seriously
affected. By contrast, we did not observe alterations in
the expression of other ER-Ca2+ binding proteins, such
as CALNX (Supplementary Figure S1E). Overall, these
data may suggest that MPM cells display a critical
perturbation in [Ca2+]ER, most likely due to a lack in the
activity of two of the main proteins involved in Ca2+
release and Ca2+ reuptake at ER level.
It is well established that the triggering of apoptosis
involves Ca2+ influx via mitochondrial, cytoplasmic
and ER-mediated mechanisms [30]. Similarly, it is
well known that transformed cells lacking apoptosis
exhibit a reduced capacity to maintain an excessive
intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i); this is often
due to store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) that is no longer
functional and/or suppressed by Ca2+ efflux across the
plasma membrane (PM) [8]. To investigate whether

highlighting Ca2+ handling as a potential target for the
pharmacological treatment of tumors [18]. In particular,
perturbations in Ca2+ homeostasis and alterations in the
principal pumps and channels responsible for appropriate
Ca2+ handling have been found in cancers of different
histotypes [19–23]. It has been reported that the mineral
asbestos, which is considered the main cause of MPM
onset/progression, induces an endoplasmic reticulum
(ER)-stress response, consequently altering ER-Ca2+
([Ca2+]ER) release [24]. Furthermore, several compounds
considered to be promising molecules for the treatment of
MPM are capable of inducing oxidative stress, leading to
ER-stress and Ca2+ release [24]. Moreover, mutations and
alterations in the expression of many oncogenes and tumor
suppressor genes, which are involved in the control of
both apoptosis and Ca2+ handling, have been identified in
mesothelioma specimens and are considered responsible
for MPM onset/progression [25–28].
Collectively, these data suggest the importance of
crosstalk between the dysregulation of Ca2+ homeostasis,
apoptosis and cancer progression. It is noteworthy that the
relevance of these relationships to human MPM could be
highly significant for the development of new therapeutic
approaches for this cancer, which at present is neglected.
In this study, MPM-specimens exhibited a
global reduction in Ca2+ physiology. This characteristic
involved the inhibition of Ca2+ transfer from the ER to
the mitochondria, preserved mitochondrial integrity and
protected against Ca2+-mediated apoptosis. Furthermore,
for the first time, we demonstrated that various approaches
promoting intracellular Ca2+ accumulation restored the
typically deficient levels of apoptosis in MPM cells back
to physiological levels.

RESULTS
MPM specimens exhibit dysregulated
cellular Ca2+ signaling
Our study aimed to investigate whether intracellular
Ca2+ plays a key role in the progression of MPM. To
measure intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis, we used aequorin
probes targeted to different subcellular compartments.
These experiments employed the inositol triphosphate
agonist bradykinin (BK), which is known to act via
distinct surface membrane receptors to promote ER-Ca2+
mobilization [29]. The data shown in Figure 1A demonstrate
that short-term cell cultures derived from biopsies of MPMaffected patients (MPM) exhibited a marked reduction
in [Ca2+]m uptake in response to stimulation of the cells
with BK when compared with cell cultures derived from
biopsies of healthy individuals (HM). In parallel, we found
the same features in MPM commercial cell lines (Figure 1B
and Supplementary Figure S1A–1B).

Ca2+ signaling was not restricted to the mitochondrial

this remodeling of Ca2+ signaling is also a characteristic
of MPM, a cytosolic aequorin Ca2+ probe and the Ca2+
indicator FURA-2/AM were used to measure capacitative
and basal Ca2+ influx, respectively. The data reported in
Supplementary Figure S1F show that the MPM cell lines
exhibited reduced Ca2+ influx activity. Indeed, MPP89
cells displayed a significant reduction in their ability to

with HMC. In accordance with these data, the basal
[Ca2+]i was markedly lower in the MPM cells compared
with the control cells (Figure 1G–1H).
Many studies have established that multiple cancer
types are associated with alterations in the expression of
proteins involved in the movement of Ca2+ across the PM,

specifically Ca2+ channels and pumps such as TRP-channels
(TRPCs) and PM Ca2+-ATPase pumps (ATP2Bs) [8].
Thus, we assessed the expression of TRPCs
and ATP2Bs in MPM and HMC cells. We found that
the protein levels of the TRPC isoforms TRPC1 and
TRP4C3 were substantially reduced in mesothelioma
cells compared with HMC cells (Figure 1I). Furthermore,
consistent with the basal intracellular Ca2+ measurements
reported in Figure 1G–1H, we found that expression of
the ATP2Bs, including isoform ATP2B4, was increased
in MPM cells (Figure 1J). Importantly, it has been
demonstrated that this ATP2B4 isoform is strongly
involved in tumorigenesis [31].

death [6]. Various apoptotic stimuli, such as menadione,
H2O2 and C2-ceramide (C2), induce the movement of Ca2+
from the ER to the mitochondrial compartment [32, 33].
Based on these findings, we investigated whether treatment
with these stimuli promoted the apoptotic process via the
use of Ca2+ as a cofactor that sensitizes mesothelioma cells
for apoptotic cell death.
First, we analyzed the biochemical characteristics
of the apoptotic process in cells subjected to oxidative
stress (menadione). As expected, we found that apoptotic
activity was strongly induced in HMCs treated with
menadione, but not in MPM cells, where the ability of
the oxidative agent to induce apoptosis was abrogated
(Figure 3A–3B and Supplementary Figure S3A–3B).
Then, we measured apoptosis after the administration
of other apoptotic agents. We found that treatment with
H2O2 and C2 did not activate the apoptotic program in
mesothelioma cells (Supplementary Figure S3C).
As mentioned above, exposure to different apoptotic
stimuli may trigger or enhance the amount of Ca2+ released
from the ER. Thus, we investigated whether the apoptotic
characteristics of menadione are associated with Ca2+
signaling via the ER. MPM and HMC cells were loaded
with the Ca2+ indicator FURA-2/AM and monitored during
stimulation with menadione. The addition of menadione
to HMCs caused a rapid elevation of FURA-2-associated
intracellular fluorescence during the following 30 min. In
contrast, this increase was significantly reduced in MPM
cells (Figure 3C–3D and Supplementary Figure S3D).
During apoptosis, mitochondria undergo massive
fragmentation with concomitant permeabilization of the
outer mitochondrial membrane and cytochrome c release.
Furthermore, the mitochondrial membrane potential
(Ψm) collapses, and the amount of ROS produced is
augmented [34]. As demonstrated, we found remarkable
morphological injury to the mitochondria, prominent
dissipation of the Ψm and a notable augmentation of
mitochondrial ROS production in HMC cells. No
difference was detected in MPM cells treated with
menadione (Figure 3E–3H and Supplementary Figure
S3E–3H).
In recent years, important studies have indicated
a key role for Ca2+ in apoptotic cell death based on the
finding that specific oncogenes and tumor suppressor
genes regulate cell death by perturbing intracellular
Ca2+ homeostasis [35]. We therefore examined
whether mesothelioma cells displayed some of these
characteristics. We detected a prominent increase in the
protein expression of activated AKT, BCL2 and BCL2L1
in MPM cells compared with normal mesothelial cells
(Figure 4A). Importantly, we also found a significant
reduction in the protein levels of the oncosuppressor PML
(Figure 4A). Altogether, these findings may explain the
observed dysregulated cellular Ca2+ signaling. Several
works highlight the presence of a direct interaction
between PML and AKT to modulate the Ca2+ handling.

MPM specimens exhibited alterations of the
apoptotic machinery
As described above, Ca2+ plays various key
physiological roles in normal human cells. Importantly,
Ca2+ overload has been considered to be a final common
pathway of apoptosis. Because we found significant
differences in Ca2+ homeostasis between MPM and HMC
cells, we sought to examine the rate of apoptosis under our
experimental conditions. We found that HMC cells display
significantly higher apoptotic levels than those observed
in MPM cells (Figure 2A–2C and Supplementary Figure
S2). Furthermore, these findings were clearly confirmed
by analyzing the levels of apoptosis in other mesothelioma
specimens (Supplementary Figure S2).
Notably, a major criticism of cell lines is that
they grow indefinitely in the laboratory and could differ
genetically from primary tissue, accumulating new
mutations as they adapt to their artificial environment.
To address this issue, we performed the same apoptosis
assays on primary cell cultures obtained from biopsies
of healthy individuals (HM) or MPM-affected patients.
The results of these studies confirmed our hypothesis.
Indeed, mesothelioma specimens exhibited a sustained
downregulation of the apoptosis pathway compared with
normal mesothelial cells (Figure 2D–2F).

Dysregulated cellular Ca2+ signaling exerts
adverse effects on the execution of the
mitochondrial apoptotic process and on the
sensitivity to apoptotic stimuli
Due to the large differences in the modulation
of Ca2+ homeostasis and the activity of the apoptotic
machinery between normal mesothelial and mesothelioma
cells, we sought to examine whether these two aspects of
cell death were interrelated. Ca2+ transfer from the ER
to the mitochondria has been shown to be involved in
several models of apoptosis. Importantly, it has been well
demonstrated that this event is directly responsible for
mitochondrial Ca2+ overload, mitochondrial permeability
transition (MPT) pore opening and caspase-mediated cell

Furthermore, it has been widely reported that IP3 receptors
(ITPRs) are substrates for AKT [36] and, in particular,
that AKT controls the Ca2+-dependent apoptotic process
by regulating ITPR3 activity [37]. Thus, we investigated
the possible relationship between ITPR3 and AKT in
mesothelioma cells. MPM cells (primary and commercial
cell lines) were collected, lysed and immunoprecipitated
with ITPR3 antibody.
Next, immunoprecipitated fractions were assayed
for phosphorylation using an AKT-substrate (AKT-S)

the endogenous type III ITPR was highly phosphorylated

that is typical of MPM, we attempted to force Ca2+-influx
into mesothelioma cells because higher [Ca2+]i should
increase mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake, thereby activating
the apoptotic machinery. MPP89 cells were pretreated
with a high external [Ca2+] (10 mM) or with sodium
orthovanadate (Na3VO4, NaV, 1 μM), a general inhibitor
of P-type ATPases, in particular ATP2Bs [38].
After 5 days of incubation in [Ca2+] or NaV, the
growth capacity of the cells was affected (Figure 5A): a
crystal violet cell proliferation assay indicated that the
mesothelioma cells were less proliferative in the presence of
high external [Ca2+] or NaV. This reduction in cell number
suggested that the sensitivity of these cells to apoptosis was
restored. Indeed, after 5 days of pretreatment with either
compound, the MPP89 cells exhibited reactivation of the
apoptotic machinery (Figure 5B).
The inhibition of ATP2Bs promoted by NaV and
the high external [Ca2+] should increase the [Ca2+]i levels
and, in turn, [Ca2+]m uptake. Thus, we investigated the
effect of NaV and 10 mM [Ca2+] on mitochondrial Ca2+
homeostasis. As illustrated in Figure 5B, a relevant
increase in the cleavage of CASP3 was detected after
just 3 days; this effect was maintained through the fifth
day. Based on this finding, we measured the ability of the
mitochondria to absorb Ca2+ after 3 days of treatment.
Our hypotheses were confirmed: pretreated MPP89 cells
exhibited significant augmentation of [Ca2+]m uptake
(Supplementary Figure S4A). In addition to this, we found
that these compounds also considerably modulated the
overall intracellular Ca2+ signaling (Supplementary Figure
S4B–S4C).
Even if NaV is reported to be a potent inhibitor of
ATP2B4, we cannot be sure that the observed effects are
due to a selective and unique interference with ATP2B4
activity.
Thus, to rule out the possibility that we were
observing spurious effects, we evaluated the impact of
silencing ATP2B4 on mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake and
the apoptotic process using RNA interference (RNAi).
Silencing ATP2B4 in MPM cells expressing a mtAEQ
restores the [Ca2+]m uptake (Supplementary Figure
S4A). In addition, the RNAi rescues the sensitivity of
mesothelioma cells to apoptotic stimuli (Figure 5C–5E).
Because increasing the intracellular Ca2+ levels
restored the ability of the mitochondria to take up Ca2+
and to initiate the apoptotic process in MPM cells, we
examined whether the direct and positive modulation of
[Ca2+]m could rescue the sensitivity of mesothelioma cells
to apoptotic stimuli.
Recent publications report the identification of the
complex responsible for [Ca2+]m uptake: the mitochondrial
Ca2+ uniporter (MCU) complex [39]. From its molecular
discovery, several studies have investigated the significance
of mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake on specific cellular processes,
including carcinogenesis, through the modulation of MCU

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

expression levels [40]. For example, a recent study identified
MCU down-regulation as a characteristic feature of some
human colon and prostate cancer cells [40]. No studies have
yet assessed MCU in the context of mesothelioma. Based
on these data, we investigated the MCU protein levels in
normal and mesothelioma cells. Interestingly, we found that
MPM cells displayed a significant reduction in the basal
MCU protein levels (Figure 5F). Next, we explored whether
the modulation of MCU activity could modulate apoptotic
cell death via regulation of [Ca2+]m uptake in normal and
MPM cells. HMCs were transfected using a specific shRNA
to silence MCU expression. Compared to the shRNA
control, cells transfected with shRNA-MCU (shMCU)
showed a significant decrease in the MCU protein levels
(Figure 5G) and a significant reduction of [Ca2+]m in HMCs
(Supplementary Figure S4D). Furthermore, silencing MCU
induced a marked reduction in the apoptotic machinery and
in the sensitivity to pro-apoptotic stimuli (Figure 5H).
Similar experiments were carried out in MPM cells.
Contrary to HMCs, we investigated the effects induced by
MCU overexpression in MPM samples.
First, we evaluated the ability of the MCU
plasmid to modulate MCU expression. As expected, a
marked increase in the MCU protein levels was found
upon MCU overexpression (Figure 5I). Next, we tested
the effectiveness of MCU in modulating [Ca2+]m. The
data (Supplementary Figure S4A) demonstrated that
MCU caused a marked enhancement of the increase
in [Ca2+]m.
Then, we investigated the possible activation of
the apoptotic cascade. Mesothelioma cells with forced
increases in the expression of MCU protein displayed
elevated apoptotic activity (Figure 5I). Finally, we
explored whether the augmentation of MCU expression
sensitized mesothelioma cells to apoptotic stimuli. As
reported in Figure 5J–5K, we detected a prominent
activation of the apoptotic machinery in MCU-expressing
cells that were exposed to a Ca2+-dependent apoptotic
stimulus.

We attempted to reproduce this last set of
experiments using primary cells obtained from biopsies of
MPM-affected patients. MPM cells were pretreated with
a high external [Ca2+] (10 mM) or with 1 μM NaV for
5 days, and the growth capacity of the cells was assessed.
We found that similar to the mesothelioma cell lines,
the primary mesothelioma short-term cultures were less
proliferative in the presence of high external [Ca2+] or NaV
after 5 days of incubation (Figure 6A). In parallel with
the demonstrated involvement of the apoptotic machinery,
the amount of cleaved CASP3 was increased (Figure 6B).
Similar results were obtained after ATP2B4 silencing. In

fact, compared to the siRNA control, cells transfected
with siRNA-ATP2B4 (siATP2B4) showed a significant
decrease in protein expression (Figure 6C), accompanied
with a prominent increase in [Ca2+]m (Supplementary
Figure S4A). We also evaluated the effects of ATP2B4
silencing in modulating the apoptotic response. To assess
whether ATP2B4 silencing modified the apoptotic process,
we challenged siATP2B4-transfected MPM cells with the
Ca2+-dependent apoptotic stimulus menadione. As result,
the silencing of ATP2B4 promoted reactivation of the
apoptotic machinery and sensitized mesothelioma cells to
apoptotic stimuli (Figure 6D–6E).
Next, to examine the relationship between Ca2+
signaling and the apoptotic process, we evaluated
whether direct modulation of [Ca2+]m signaling was useful
and necessary to enhance the sensitivity of cancerous
cells to apoptosis-sensitizing cofactors. As first, and
similarly to the mesothelioma cell lines, we found that
cells obtained from biopsies of MPM-affected patients
displayed lower amounts of MCU protein than HMCs
(Figure 6F). This evidence confirms our hypothesis that
MCU is a key player in mesothelioma disease. Thus,
to increase the ability of mitochondria to absorb Ca2+,
MPM cells were transfected with the MCU plasmid
and treated with the Ca2+-dependent apoptotic stimulus
menadione. The results obtained were very promising: the
amount of active CASP3 and the fluorescence intensity
of Annexin-V after the addition of menadione were
significantly increased when the cells were transfected
with MCU (Figure 6G–6I). Next, we aimed to confirm the
importance of MCU during the Ca2+-dependent apoptotic
process by promoting MCU-silencing in primary HMC
samples. As expected, silencing of MCU reduces the
ability of mitochondria to take up Ca2+ (Supplementary
Figure S4D) and the MCU protein levels (Figure 6J).
Of particular interest, we confirmed that shRNA-MCU
(shMCU)-transfected HMC samples were less sensitive to
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

apoptosis-sensitizing treatments than samples transfected
with the control shRNA (Figure 6J–6K).
Overall these results highlight the role of MCU
during MPM onset and demonstrate that by modulating
Ca2+ handling, it could be possible to develop novel
therapeutic approaches against this disease. Interestingly,
treatments with NaV and high external [Ca2+] restore Ca2+
signaling and apoptosis without affecting MCU expression
(Supplementary Figure S5A–5B), demonstrating the
significance of correct ER-mitochondrial Ca2+ crosstalk as a primary contributor to the apoptotic program in
mesothelioma.

DISCUSSION
Few research studies have examined the importance
of Ca2+ in MPM. Several investigations have indicated
roles for different proteins in executing the mitochondrial
(intrinsic) apoptotic pathway, and although many of
these proteins are involved in Ca2+-handling, the direct
relationship between Ca2+ and the regulation of apoptosis
has yet to be addressed.
Among these proteins, BCL2 family members
and the oncogene AKT were found to be dysregulated
in mesothelioma cells [41–43]. Notably, it is widely
appreciated that these proteins are also fundamental
cofactors of the Ca2+-dependent pathway of apoptosis
[9, 44]. Given these findings, our results associate the
lack of apoptosis that is characteristic of mesothelioma
cells with the core mechanism of the Ca2+-dependent
apoptotic pathway. Notably, we found that MPM cells
display a significant alteration in the expression levels of
the apoptosis-related proteins reported above, including
BCL2, BCL2L1 and AKT. Of relevance, in several tumor
types the kinase AKT may exert its antiapoptotic function
by regulating the type III ITPRs. Our results suggest that
this feature is also preserved in mesothelioma disease. We

found that the AKT-mediated ITPR3 phosphorylation was
higher than in normal mesothelial cells. Furthermore, the
levels of the oncosuppressor PML were reduced in MPM
cells. PML was recently found to trigger the apoptotic
program by modulating Ca2+ release from the ER [33].
This finding may support the hypothesis that MPM cells
exhibit dysregulated Ca2+ signaling. The results reported
in Figure 1 and Supplementary Figure S2 robustly
support this model and demonstrate that the overall Ca2+
homeostasis of MPM cells is strongly affected.
Considering these results, we wondered whether Ca2+
is involved in the lack of apoptosis that is characteristic of
mesothelioma cells. To address this question, we analyzed
whether pro-apoptotic stimuli promote the apoptotic process
via the employment of Ca2+ as an apoptosis-sensitizing
cofactor. When normal mesothelial cells were exposed
to apoptotic stimuli, we detected the progressive release
of Ca2+ from intracellular stores, along with consequent
alterations in mitochondrial energy and structure and,
subsequently, the activation of caspases. In contrast, MPM
cells were insensitive to these stimuli. Thus, these findings
indicate that the observed reduction in Ca2+ homeostasis
represents a pivotal mediator of the unresponsiveness
of MPM cells to apoptotic stimuli. Studies are currently
underway to elucidate the exact molecular mechanisms that
underlie the downregulation of Ca2+ signaling which occurs
in mesothelioma. Considering our results, we hypothesize
that the PML-AKT-Ca2+ axis is directly involved in
mesothelioma because a close relationship between AKTPML and Ca2+-dependent apoptosis has already been
demonstrated in other tumor types [33]. Furthermore,
based on the identification of relevant alterations in Ca2+
flux across the PM and in the expression of specific Ca2+
channels and pumps, we also propose that these molecules
actively participate in the pathogenesis of MPM. Consistent
with this, silencing PMCA by RNA interference or NaV
treatment restores the Ca2+ homeostasis and rescues the
sensitivity of mesothelioma to apoptotic stimuli. Of
relevance, the use of vanadate compounds as therapeutic
agents has been reported [45, 46].
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

However, we do not exclude the role of other
molecular pathways in the pathogenesis of MPM.
Indeed, the key role of BCL2/L1 in mesothelioma has
been well demonstrated, and the use of pharmacological
inhibitors of BCL2 family members is promising.
Unfortunately, the development of these inhibitors requires
further refinement [47]. Other studies have suggested
the involvement of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) in
mesothelioma. Once activated, these kinases lead to the
upregulation of two major downstream cell signaling
cascades: the RAF1-MEK-RAS-ERK and PI3K-AKTPTEN-MTOR pathways. Based on these findings, small
molecule inhibitors of specific RTKs were applied in
clinical studies, but they displayed only limited activity
in advanced MPM patients [48, 49]. It is clear that several
studies have identified molecules that mediate MPM, but
a well-established molecular pathway and an effective
molecular approach to combat this disease have yet to be
discovered and developed.
Recent evidence has shown that specific cellular
processes regulated by mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake,
including carcinogenesis, are strictly supervised through
the modulation and expression of the recent discovery
channel (MCU) responsible for a correct [Ca2+]m handling.
For example, MCU silencing attenuates [Ca2+]m [9, 10],
and reduced [Ca2+]m levels suppress cell death in a variety
of cancerous cell lines, including those derived from
the cervix, central nervous system and lymph tissues
[44, 50, 51]. Furthermore, reduced MCU levels have been
found in human samples of colon and prostate cells [40].
Nevertheless, the potential role for MCU to modulate
cell death and other events in mesothelioma has not
yet been addressed. Thus, having observed the critical
dysregulation in overall Ca2+ handling and Ca2+-dependent
apoptosis, we hypothesized that MCU could be affected
in mesothelioma cells. The results reported in Figure
5F and 6F support this hypothesis and show that MPM
samples display an overall reduction in MCU expression.
Based on these findings, we evaluated the involvement
of the MCU in regulating the [Ca2+]m levels and survival as a

Committee, Ferrara, Italy. Samples were obtained in
sterile conditions and put in RPMI medium supplied with
50 U/ml of penicillin (CAMBREX) and 50 mg/ml of
streptomycin (CAMBREX). The biopsy samples were cut
in small pieces and transferred to 25-cm2 flasks containing
RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS
(CAMBREX), 2 mM L-glutamine (CAMBREX), 25 U/ml

possible fundamental aspect of the pathology of MPM. The
results were surprising. We detected a remarkable reduction
in cell growth accompanied by an increase in the apoptotic
response and a restored sensitivity to proapoptotic agents.
Interestingly, one of the most recent advances in
cancer research is the demonstration that microRNAs
(miRs) cause a variety of human disorders, particularly
cancer [52, 53], and regulate the expression of genes
encoding key regulatory molecules of Ca2+ signaling.
Specifically, miR-25 was found to decrease mitochondrial
Ca2+ uptake via specific MCU downregulation, conferring
resistance to apoptotic stimuli [40]. One intriguing
finding is that a comparative analysis of miR expression
demonstrated that miR-25 was markedly upregulated in
MPM cells [54]. Therefore, we sought to verify whether
miR-25 may be a feature during the progression of
MPM. Preliminary results (data not shown) suggest that
inhibition of miR-25 may modulate apoptotic cell death
via the enhancement of [Ca2+]m uptake. In addition, a
marked increase in the levels of MCU protein was found
following miR-25 inhibition (data not shown).
Nevertheless it may be possible to consider miR-25
as a possible diagnostic marker and a novel therapeutic
target, it is well known that a single miR can target
multiple downstream transcripts and that many transcripts
can be regulated by multiple miRs. Thus, further
investigations are ongoing to discern the exact relationship
between MPM, MCU and miR-25.
In conclusion, i) intracellular Ca2+ signaling plays
an important role in MPM; ii) the downregulation of Ca2+
handling exerts an adverse effect on the execution of the
apoptotic process and iii) on the sensitivity to apoptotic
stimuli; iv) the recovery of Ca2+ homeostasis enhances
Ca2+ uptake by the mitochondria, thereby promoting
apoptotic activity; and v) MCU is a key mediator of MPM,
and vi) its pharmacological modulation restores the rate of
apoptosis and the sensitivity to apoptotic stimuli.

calibrated offline into [Ca2+] values using a computer
algorithm based on the Ca2+ response curve of wild-type
and mutant aequorins.

The cytosolic Ca2+ response was evaluated using the
fluorescent Ca2+ indicator Fura-2/AM (Life Technologies).
Cells were grown on 24-mm coverslips and incubated
at 37°C for 30 min in 1 mM Ca2+/KRB supplemented
with 2.5 mM Fura-2/AM, 0.02% Pluronic F-68 (Sigma),
0.1 mM Sulfinpyrazone (Sigma). The cells were then
washed and supplied with 1 mM Ca2+/ KRB. To determine
the Ca2+ cytosolic response, the cells were placed in
an open Leyden chamber on a 37°C thermo-controlled
stage and exposed to 340/380 wavelength light using the
Olympus Xcellence multiple wavelength high-resolution
fluorescence microscopy system equipped with a UAPON
40 × 0340-2 objective, numerical aperture 1.35 (Olympus).
The fluorescence data were expressed as emission ratios.
Fluorescence was measured every 100 ms, and the [Ca2+]i
was calculated by the ratio method using the equation:
[Ca2+]c 1/4 Kd (R–Rmin)/(R–Rmax) Sf2/Sf1.
To measure the thapsigargin-releasable Ca2+ levels,
cells grown on 24-mm coverslips were incubated for 30
min in 1 mM Ca2+-free medium/KRB supplemented with
2.5 mM Fura-2/AM, 0.02% Pluronic F-68 (Sigma), 0.1
mM Sulfinpyrazone (Sigma) and EGTA 100 μM. The
fluorescence was measured every 100 ms. After 2 min.,
thapsigargin 100 nM was added to the cells, and the
amount of Ca2+ released was estimated by normalization
of the 340/380 ratio.

phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in a modified 10 mM
Tris buffer pH 7.4 containing 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton
X-100, 10% glycerol, 10 mM EDTA and protease inhibitor
cocktail. After 30 min of incubation on ice, the lysates were
cleared via centrifugation at 12,000 g at 4°C for 10 min.
Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad
procedure. Protein extracts, 15 or 25 μg, were separated
on 4–12% bis-tris acrylamide and 4–20% tris-glycine gels
(Life technologies, NP0323 and EC6026) and electrotransferred to PVDF or nitrocellulose membrane according
to standard procedures. Non-specific binding sites were
saturated by incubating the membranes with TBS-Tween

for 1 h. Next, the membranes were incubated overnight
with primary antibodies, and the binding was assessed
using appropriate HRP-labeled secondary antibodies [Life
Technologies, A16104 (goat anti-rabbit) and A24512 (goat
anti-mouse)] plus a chemiluminescent substrate (Thermo

were reconstituted with coelenterazine n (Tebu-Bio, LePerray-en-Yvelines, France), after ER Ca2+ depletion
by incubation for 1 h at 4°C in KRB supplemented
with 100 mM EGTA and 40 mM tBHQ (2,5-Di-tertbutylhydroquinone) (Sigma). The cells were then washed
with KRB supplemented with 2% BSA and 1 mM EGTA.
Cells that were transfected with cytAEQ and mtAEQ were
reconstituted with coelenterazine (Synchem, Felsberg/

1 mM CaCl2. All aequorin measurements were carried
out in 1 mM Ca2+/KRB (cytAEQ and mtAEQ) or 100
mM EGTA/KRB (erAEQ). ER refilling was trigger by
perfusing with 1 mM Ca2+/KRB until a steady state was
reached. An agonist was added to the same medium, as
specified in the figures. The experiments were terminated
by lysing the cells with 100 mM digitonin in a hypotonic

transfected with 1.5 μg of plasmid DNA mtGFP. After 36 h
of expression, the cells were treated as described and then
imaged with a Nikon Swept Field confocal microscope
equipped with a CFI Plan Apo VC60XH objective (n.a.
1.4) (Nikon Instruments, Melville, NY) and an Andor
DU885 EM-CCD camera (Andor Technology Ltd, Belfast,
Northern Ireland). When indicated, the cells were treated
with the reported compound. The coverslip were placed in
an incubation chamber with controlled temperature, CO2
and humidity, and then 51-plane z-stacks were acquired
with a voxel dimension of 133x133x200 nm (X Y x Z). The
mitochondrial network was described in number and volume
using the 3D object counter available in software Fiji (http://
fiji.sc/wiki/index.php/Fiji, last accessed June 20, 2011).

Images were taken with a Nikon Swept Field
Confocal (Nikon). For each condition, at least 25
independent visual fields were counted. Mesothelioma
cells were washed with PBS, fixed in 4% formaldehyde
for 10 min and washed with PBS. Then, the cells were
permeabilized for 10 min with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS
and blocked in PBS containing 2% BSA and 0.05% Triton
X-100 for 1 h. The cells were then incubated with primary
antibody (anti-cytochrome c and anti-HSPD1) for 3 h
at room temperature and washed three times with PBS.
The appropriate isotype-matched, AlexaFluor-conjugated
secondary antibodies [Life Technologies, A11008 (488
goat anti-rabbit) and A-21050 (633 goat anti-mouse)]
were used. Images were obtained with a Nikon Swept
Field confocal equipped with a CFI Plan Apo VC60XH
objective (n.a. 1.4) (Nikon Instruments, Melville, NY) and
an Andor DU885 EM-CCD camera (Andor Technology
Ltd, Belfast, Northern Ireland). Statistical evaluation
was performed using the colocalization counter JACOP,
available in the Fiji software.

Detection of mitochondrial ROS

The shRNA targeting MCU (TRCN0000133861)
was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. The siRNA targeting
ATP2B4 (GS493) was purchased from Qiagen. shRNA and
siRNA were transfected using the HiPerfect® transfection
reagent according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

The cells were seeded onto 24-mm glass coverslips
and allowed to grow to 60–70% confluence. The cells
were then incubated with MitoSOX-Red indicator
(Life Technologies Ltd) for 30 min and washed. When
indicated, cells were treated with the pro-apoptotic
compound menadione. After washing, the amount of
mitochondrial superoxide was determined using a Tali™
image-based cytometer (Life Technologies). The data
are presented as a histogram showing the % of the mean
intensity of MitoSOX fluorescence.

Mitochondrial Ψm

Growth curve assay

Mitochondrial Ψm was measured by loading cells with
20 nM tetramethyl rhodamine methyl ester (TMRM; Life
Technologies) for 30 min at 37° C. The TMRM excitation
was performed at 560 nm and emission was collected
through a 590 to 650 nm band-pass filter. Images were taken
every 5 s with a fixed 20-ms exposure time using a Nikon
Swept Field confocal equipped with CFI Plan Apo VC60XH
objective (n.a. 1.4) (Nikon Instruments, Melville, NY)

Cell growth curves were generated by crystal violet
staining. Cells were seeded with a low cell density (5.000
per well) in 12-well plates in triplicate and allowed to
grow for 5 days. At 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 days, the cells were
washed with phosphate-buffered saline, fixed with 4%
paraformaldehyde and stained with 0.1% crystal violet.
Crystal violet was dissolved with 1 mol/l acetic acid, and
the A595 was measured.
