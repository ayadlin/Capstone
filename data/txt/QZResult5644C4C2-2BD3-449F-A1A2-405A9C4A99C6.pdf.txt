ABSTRACT
Colorectal cancer remains a major public health problem worldwide. Despite the
introduction of antiangiogenic drugs for the treatment of metastatic disease, a large
number of issues remains unresolved. In particular, studies on predictive biomarkers
of response and pathways of resistance to these agents are lacking, making it difficult
to accurately select candidates for treatment. Hypoxia is the prime driving force for
tumor angiogenesis and a vicious cycle between hypoxia and angiogenesis can be
observed in tumors. Anti-angiogenic drugs act inhibiting tumor vasculature and, as
consequence, inducing hypoxia. However, hypoxia could, in turn, induce an increase
of metastatic potential of cells and a series of phenomena that could induce drug
resistance. In the present review biological mechanisms of hypoxia and its relation
with angiogenesis, and resistance to antiangiogenic therapy will be discussed.
Moreover, data from clinical trials on antiangiogenic drugs in metastatic colorectal
cancer will be reviewed, and the role of hypoxia in monitoring the response to
treatment will be analysed. Combination strategies using anti-angiogenic and hypoxia
inhibiting drugs are also discussed as they constitute promising field of research.

INTRODUCTION

hypoxia represents a constant event during treatment with
an antiangiogenic drug, and it is, in turn, a mechanism
responsible for resistance to therapy.
In this review we examine the principal AI used in
clinical practice for metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC)
and focus on the biological mechanisms of hypoxia,
especially in relation to angiogenesis, which may be
responsible for resistance to therapy. We also discuss how
hypoxia could be used to monitor the response to these
drugs, and argue the hypothesis for using combination
strategies composed of AI and agents that are capable of
inhibiting hypoxia.

Colorectal cancer is one of the commonest cancers
in the world [1]. Over the last decade, the development
of targeted therapies has enriched the therapeutic
armamentarium in the management of metastatic disease,
resulting in significant gains in patient survival.
In particular, angiogenesis targeting via the vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF) pathway has raised
the attention of clinicians, considering the favourable
survival benefit given by bevacizumab (Bev) in clinical
trials in both first [2] and second line [3] settings. More
recently, large phase III studies have shown clinical
efficacy also in the new anti-angiogenic agents Zivaflibercept [4] and regorafenib [5]. However, benefits
of angiogenesis inhibitors (AI) in an unselected patient
population are modest. To date the research of predictive
biomarkers has been unsuccessful and the mechanisms of
resistance to such agents are unknown [6]. Induction of

*Primary endpoint of the study.

Regorafenib in 2012. Bev is a humanized immunoglobulin
(Ig) G1 monoclonal antibody directed against all isoforms
of VEGF-A. It binds to VEGF-A inhibiting its link to the
receptors (VEGFR-1,-2) on the surface of endothelial
cells. As a consequence, the proliferation of endothelial
cells and the creation of new blood vessels are blocked
[7]. Ziv-Aflibercept is a fusion protein AI, designed to
bind to VEGF-A, VEGF-B, and PIGF with higher affinity
than their native receptors (VEGFR-1,-2). It acts as a
“VEGF trap”, thus inhibiting multiple pathways involved
in oncogenesis and tumor angiogenesis [8]. Regorafenib
is a small molecule, multi-kinase inhibitor, acting against
a wide range of tyrosine kinases including RET, VEGFR,
KIT, PDGFR, FGFR, TIE2, DDR2, TrkA, Eph2A, RAF-1,
BRAF, BRAFV600E, SAPK2, PTK5, and Abl [9] (Figure
1).
Data from the major phase III trials that have led to
drug approval are being reviewed in this section.
Several phase III randomised clinical trials have
investigated the efficacy of Bev added to first-line
chemotherapy in mCRC patients, with non univocal
but generally positive results (Table 1). In the pivotal
AVF2107 study, the addition of Bev to the IFL regimen led
to a significant increase in PFS (10.6 vs. 6.2 months, HR
0.54, P < 0.001) and OS (20.3 vs. 15.6 months, HR 0.66,
P < 0.001), independently of KRAS mutational status [2].
In the same period a small single-centre randomised trial
of Bev added to a similar bolus regimen of irinotecan and
5 fluorouracil showed no difference neither in OS (22.0
vs. 25.0 months, P = 0.13) nor in the response rate [10].
The study NO16966 on Bev added to XELOX or
FOLFOX4 revealed a statistically significant improvement
in PFS (9.4 vs. 8.0 months, HR 0.83, P = 0.0023), but
not in OS (21.3 vs. 19.9 months, HR 0.89, P = 0.077)
in the overall population [11]. Similarly, the ITACa
randomized phase III trial failed to show any benefit from
the addition of Bev to first-line standard chemotherapy
(FOLFIRI or FOLFOX4). PFS, the primary study
endpoint, was 9.6 months for chemotherapy plus Bev and
8.4 months for chemotherapy alone, with a HR of 0.86
(P = 0.182). No statistically significant differences in OS
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

or ORR were observed, and results were independent of
KRAS status [12]. Trials using Bev combined only with
fluoropyrimidines reported a significant increase in PFS,
but not in OS [13-16].
The head-to-head comparison between anti-VEGF
and anti-EGFR agents in combination with first line
chemotherapy in KRAS WT mCRC patients was analyzed
in 2 large randomized phase III prospective trials, the
CALGB/SWOG 80405 and the FIRE-3 [17-19] . A meta
analysis of the data from the CALGB/SWOG 80405,
the FIRE-3 and the PEAK (a phase II trial comparing
FOLFOX-Panitumumab to FOLFOX-B) showed higher
ORR and OS with first-line anti-EGFR therapy, compared
with anti-VEGF therapy in both KRAS-WT and all RASWT patients with mCRC, without any significant impact
on PFS [20].
The TRIBE randomized phase III multicenter
clinical trial showed that FOLFOXIRI plus Bev
significantly improved patients PFS and OS with respect to
FOLFIRI plus Bev, and that the efficacy was irrespective
of baseline clinical characteristics and RAS or BRAF
mutational status [21].
The vast amount of data from first-line randomized
phase III trials supports the use of first-line Bev in
combination with chemotherapy in RAS mutated patients
(on the basis of superior PFS and OS) and the use of antiEGFR therapy as an alternative to anti-VEGF therapy in
all RAS-WT patients (on the basis of higher ORR and OS
rates).
The use of AI in second-line settings is supported
by the results of 4 randomized phase III clinical trials, that
have been recently undergone (Table 2).
The E3200 was a randomized study on the addition
of Bev to second-line FOLFOX4 in patients that were
refractory to a fluoropyrimidine/irinotecan-based regimen
(not containing Bev) [3]. The FOLFOX4+Bev arm
patients had an improved OS (from 10.8 to 12.9 months, P
= 0.0011) and PFS (7.3 vs. 4.7 months, P < 0.0001), with
respect to those treated with chemotherapy alone.
The ML18147 was a prospective randomized phase
III trial assessing the efficacy of Bev continued beyond

progression after a first-line Bev containing chemotherapy.
The results were in favour of the continuation of Bev, as
a higher OS (11.2 vs. 9.8 months, HR 0.81, P = 0.0062)
and PFS (5.7 vs. 4.1, HR 0.68 P < 0.0001) were shown
[22]. The phase III Bevacizumab BeYond Progression
(BEBYP) trial was designed similarly to ML18147 and
provided confirmatory evidence to support the efficacy of
Bev beyond progression [23].
The VELOUR trial was a randomized prospective,
placebo controlled, phase III trial investigating the
safety and activity of Ziv-aflibercept in combination
with second-line FOLFIRI in patients progressing
during or after the completion of an oxaliplatin- and a
fluoropyrimidine-containing regimen (with or without
Bev). An improvement of median OS (13.5 vs. 12.1
months, HR 0.817, P = 0.0032) and PFS (6.9 vs. 4.670
months, HR 0.758, P < 0.0001) was reported for patients
in the experimental arm rather than in the placebo arm [4].
The results of these trials are similarly indicative
of a positive role of AI, also in second-line settings (both
in naive patients and in those already treated with Bev in
first-line).
The efficacy of regorafenib was evaluated in the
randomized, multicenter, placebo controlled CORRECT
trial, conducted in mCRC patients refractory to all
approved treatment options (fluoropyrimidines, Bev,
irinotecan, oxaliplatin and, for KRAS WT patients, an
EGFR-inhibitor). Patients treated with regorafenib had
better OS (6.4 vs. 5 months, HR 0.77, P = 0.0052) and
PFS (HR = 0.49, P < 0.0001) rates compared with those in
the placebo arm [5].
As not all mCRC patients respond to antiangiogenic
agents, numerous trials have been conducted in recent
years to find biomarkers capable of identifying a subset of
patients who are most likely to benefit from such agents,
thus reducing costs and the risk of side-effects. Most of
these trials were on Bev, and have been recently reviewed
[24]. Unfortunately, several promising biomarkers in
preclinical models have failed as predictors of response
when tested in clinical trials.
Another crucial point to be considered is that the
largest majority of mCRC patients ultimately become
resistant to therapy and experience clinical progression.

For this reason, the detection of the onset of resistance
and the factors that mediate this resistance is becoming
increasingly important, in the light of recent data
supporting treatment with AI, also beyond progression.
Moreover, the pathways of resistance, if identified,
could be targeted when tumors become refractory during
treatment. In this context hypoxia could play an important
role.

INTERACTION BETWEEN HYPOXIA
AND ANGIOGENESIS IN CANCER
BIOLOGY
Hypoxia is generally defined as a state of reduced
O2 availability or decreased O2 partial pressures below
critical thresholds, that limits or even abolishes the
function of organs, tissues, or cells [25]. It represents a
stress condition that occurs frequently in several diseases,
such as solid tumors [26]. Tumor cells usually respond to
hypoxia through activation of several different pathways,
leading to a number of biological consequences [27-29].
One of the principal consequences of tumor hypoxia is the
induction of the hypoxic inducible factor (HIF) family of
transcription factors.
HIF-1 plays a central role in the cellular adaptation
to hypoxic conditions. It is a heterodimeric transcription
factor consisting of a constitutively active HIF-1β subunit
and an oxygen-regulated HIF-1α subunit [30]. In welloxygenated cells, HIF-1α is subject to O2-dependent
hydroxylation by prolyl hydroxylase 2 (PHD-2). This
event mediates von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppression
protein (pVHL) binding and subsequent ubiquitination
and proteasomal degradation [31, 32]. Under hypoxia
conditions, HIF-1α is stabilized and it dimerizes with
HIF-1β. The complex moves to the nucleus where it binds
to hypoxia response elements (HREs) within regulatory
regions of target genes [33, 34]. The heterodimeric protein
can regulate the expression of numerous genes involved
in angiogenesis, erythropoiesis, proliferation, glycolytic
tumor metabolism, metastasis, autophagy, apoptosis and
pH regulation [35, 36].
Hypoxia and HIF pathway activation in tumor cells
are important stimuli for blood vessel growth. Tumor

of the three anti-angiogenic drugs (bevacizumab, aflibercept and regorafenib) commonly used in mCRC treatment are shown in the lower
part of the figure. Hypoxia inhibits the activity of PHD enzymes, allowing HIF-1α proteins to be stabilized, to dimerize with HIF-1β and to
translocate to the nucleus. This complex binds hypoxia response elements (HREs) within the promoters of target genes. HIF-target genes
are involved in cell growth and survival, proliferation, metabolic reprogramming, apoptosis and induction of angiogenesis mediated by
vascular endothelial growth factor and angiopoietins. HIF-1α may also be upregulated in tumor cells by the activation of the PI3K-AKTmTOR pathway. VEGF family members and angiopoietins interact with their receptors (VEGFR-1,-2,-3, NP1/2, Tie2), leading to different
biological consequences. HIF: hypoxia-inducible factor; PHD: prolyl hydroxylase; HRE: hypoxia response element; PlGF: placenta growth

growth indeed depends on the development of tumor
neovasculature [37]. Tumor angiogenesis can be defined
as the formation of new blood vessels from pre-existing
vessels in a process known as sprouting angiogenesis [38].
Colorectal cancer represents a model for investigating the
effects of angiogenesis throughout tumor development. It
has high angiogenesis scores and microvessel densities,
that are associated with a high risk of metastases,
recurrence, and early patient death [39]. Angiogenesis
plays a crucial role in CRC growth, proliferation
and metastatization and it has been investigated as a
potential target for treatment of metastatic disease [40,
41]. Angiogenic properties, in particular the balance of
angiogenic activators and inhibitors, are necessary for this
cancer to growth and survive, and thus to develop from
a quiescent tumor into a more aggressive tumor. This
transition is called angiogenic switch [42, 43].
HIF-1 can directly activate the expression of a
number of pro-angiogenic factors, including vascular

endothelial growth factor (VEGF), VEGF receptors,
plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), angiopoietins
(Ang-1 and -2), platelet-derived growth factor β (PDGF-β),
the Tie-2 receptor, and matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-2
and -9) [44-46]. An essential mediator of angiogenesis is
VEGF family, which includes 5 glicoproteins (VEGF-A,
VEGF-B, VEGF-C, VEGF-D, and placental growth factor
[PlGF]), 3 receptors (VEGFR-1/Flt-1, VEGFR-2/Flk-1/
KDR, and VEGFR-3/Flt-4), and 2 co-receptors (neuropilin
NP1 and NP2) [47-50]. VEGFR-2 is the central mediator
of VEGF-stimulated tumor angiogenesis [47, 51]. When
VEGF-A binds to VEGFR-2, this receptor become
phosphorylated, and signalling pathways like the RasRaf-MAPK, and the PI3K-AKT pathways are activated
resulting in endothelial cell migration, proliferation and
survival, and tube formation [52, 53].
After binding to VEGF-A, VEGF-B and PlGF,
VEGFR-1 activation appears to be crucial in the epithelialto-mesenchymal transition [54]. VEGFR-3 binds to

Figure 2: Effect of anti-angiogenic therapy on cancer. Some tumors are intrinsically resistant to anti-angiogenic drugs, while

others initially respond with a reduction in tumor mass and vasculature, and induction of hypoxia. Hypoxia lowers pH and creates a
condition of acidosis, with the subsequent development of mechanisms of resistance: 1) induction of alternative pro-angiogenic factors,
e.g. bFGF, PDGF-β, HGF, IL-17, IL-6, IL-8 and Ang 2, which restore tumor vasculature; 2) induction of HIF-1α, which, in turn, induces
the transcription of other factors, increasing metastatic potential and invasiveness of tumor cells. Tumor cells with greater malignancy are
selected; and 3) immunomodulation through different mechanisms leading to immune escape.

VEGF-C and -D and is involved in lymphangiogenesis
[55]. PlGF promotes the survival of endothelial cells and
can modulate the effects of VEGF-A on angiogenesis
[56]. Different pathways and molecules involved in
angiogenesis have been targeted for the treatment of
colorectal cancer [57] (Figure 1).
VEGF has been shown to be involved in the growth
and development of colorectal cancer. In this type of
tumor, VEGF expression can correlate with invasiveness,
vascular density, metastasis, recurrence, and prognosis
[13, 40, 58, 59].
HIF-1 also regulates induces the expression of
angiopoietins (Ang-1 and Ang-2) and their receptor Tie2. Ang-1 and Ang-2 are specific ligands of Tie-2: its
activation promotes endothelial cell survival and vascular
maturation. Ang-1 induces vessel stabilization, while
Ang-2 is an antagonist of Ang-1 and mediates vascular
destabilization. Ang-2 is expressed in the vasculature of
many tumors, and may act synergistically with VEGF
to promote tumor-associated angiogenesis and tumor
progression [60].
Besides HIFs, other important adaptive mechanisms
to hypoxia are the unfolded protein response (UPR) and
the induction of AKT-mTOR signaling pathway [61].
Under hypoxia, incorrectly folded proteins can
accumulate in the endoplasmic reticulum, disrupting
cellular integrity. UPR increases degradation of unfolded
proteins and restores homeostasis reducing endoplasmic
reticulum stress [62, 63].
HIF-, UPR-, and mTOR-dependent responses
to hypoxia serve to tumor cells to survive these stress
conditions and seem to act in an integrated way,
influencing common downstream pathways affecting
gene expression, angiogenesis, metabolism, cell survival,
tumorigenesis, and tumor growth [61].
In summary, hypoxia is the prime driving force for
tumor angiogenesis, where imbalance of pro-angiogenic
and anti-angiogenic factors occurs [38] .

invasion through promotion of epithelial-mesenchymal
transition (EMT) process [66, 67], and lead to therapeutic
resistance [68-70].
During treatment with an anti-angiogenic drug,
tumors develop several strategies to evade the antiangiogenic effect. While some tumors are intrinsically
refractory and fail to respond to such drugs even at early
stages of treatment, others acquire evasive resistance
mechanisms to circumvent angiogenic blockade. These
mechanisms can involve the secretion of alternative
pro-angiogenic mediators such as bFGF, PDGF-β, IL17, IL-6, IL-8, Ang-2 and HGF, which may reactivate
the revascularization program [71]. Another mechanism
of resistance induction is hypoxia (Figure 2). Although
anti-angiogenic drugs act by blocking blood supply to
the tumor, the generation of an hypoxic condition may
fuel tumor progression and treatment resistance. This
represents a paradoxical effect concerning the activity of
anti-angiogenic drugs, inhibiting nutrient supply to the
tumor but at the same time inducing an increase in its
metastatic potential and invasiveness.
Hypoxia within tumor increases during treatment
with an anti-angiogenic agent, inducing pH drop and
consequent acidosis [66]. Several reports in the literature
have demonstrated a straight correlation between hypoxia
and the increase of metastatic potential, suggesting several
hypotheses to explain this [67, 68, 72, 73]. Hypoxia
condition activates the transcription factor HIF-1α, that
induces activation of p53 and cyclin-dependent kinase
inhibitors [74]. HIF-1α also induces the expression of
carbonic anhydrase IX, that promotes cell survival and
invasion [75]. Moreover, the production of reactive
oxygen species (ROS) can promote cell motility [72]
and create a favorable condition for gene mutation and
genomic instability [76] (Figure 2).
Although increased metastasis with antiangiogenic therapy has been found in pre-clinical models,
extensive reviews of patterns of relapse on and off Bev
do not support this pre-clinical observation [77]. One
possible explanation for this is the effect of additional
chemotherapeutic drugs combined with anti-angiogenics
in clinical practice such as doxorubicin, topotecan and
gemcitabine, that counteract the sunitinib-induced
metastatic dissemination of the Lewis lung carcinoma
xenograft models [78].
Another mechanism through which hypoxia
promotes cancer invasion is mediated by immune
modulation (Figure 2). Under physiological conditions,
immune cells control the normal destruction of pathogens,
foreign antigens and abnormal cells. Conversely, in a
hypoxic microenvironment, macrophages, that usually
recognize, engulf and remove dying cells, are converted
into cells with a protumorigenic and immunosuppressive
phenotype [79-85]. Lactic acid produced by tumor cells,
as a by-product of aerobic or anaerobic glycolysis, is
critical for signaling, as it induces the expression of

THE ROLE OF HYPOXIA IN ACQUIRED
RESISTANCE TO ANTI-ANGIOGENETIC
TREATMENT
As angiogenesis is an adaptive response to
tissue hypoxia [64], a vicious cycle between hypoxia
and angiogenesis can be observed in tumors. In most
malignant tumors there is an imbalance between the
supply and consumption of oxygen that generates hypoxic
regions. This condition stimulates the production of proangiogenic factors leading to tumor growth with aberrant
and chaotic vasculature. In turn, the morphological and
functional deformed blood vessels lead to a heterogeneous
distribution of oxygen, diminishing oxygen delivery to
tumor cells [65].
Hypoxia can have negative implications for clinical
outcome. It can enhance colon cancer migration and

vascular endothelial growth factor and the M2-like
polarization of tumor-associated macrophages. This effect
is mediated by HIF-1α. Moreover, the lactate-induced
expression of arginase 1 by macrophages is pivotal in
tumor growth [80]. Similarly, hypoxia and acidosis
attenuate the killing capacity of immune effector cells
in tumor microenvironment. Specific hypoxia-induced
growth factors and cytokines, such as transforming growth
factor beta (TGF-β) and VEGF are able to suppress the
activity of T lymphocytes and the ability of dendritic cells
to process antigens, and present them to lymphocytes.
Another mechanism through which hypoxia can suppress
the immune system is the up-regulation in myeloidderived suppressor cells, dendritic cells and cancer, of the
immune checkpoint protein PD-L1, via HIF-1α [86]. This
favors immune suppression and evasion.
Hypoxic conditions could also select more malignant
cells, i.e. those able to grow in hypoxic conditions [87]
(Figure 2). It produces a pressure mechanism that selects
tumor cells with increased aggressiveness and lower
sensitivity to anti-angiogenic therapy [88, 89].
All these aspects indicate that hypoxia, inevitably
induced during treatment with anti-angiogenic drugs,
may, in turn, represent a resistant mechanism to drug
activity. Mesange et al concluded that resistance to Bev
in preclinical models of colorectal cancer may be due
to an upregulation of the autocrine HIF-VEGF-VEGFR
signaling and to increased tolerance to hypoxia, probably
caused by prolonged exposure to Bev [90]. Interestingly,
the authors demonstrated that although these resistance
mechanisms were related to Bev, they did not influence
sensitivity to other anti-angiogenic drugs, such as
nintedanib. Moreover, a recent report on colorectal cancer
xenograft models showed that Bev induced important
metabolic modifications within the tumor due to alterations
in the expression of proteins involved in glucose, lipid and
fatty acid metabolism (e.g. GPD2, ATP5B, STAT3, FASN)
and in hypoxic regulation and vasculogenesis (e.g. ATP5B,
THBS1, HSPG2) [91].
Jain et al have recently advanced a theory on
how a judicious use of anti-angiogenic agents could
transiently “normalize” the abnormal tumor vasculature,
resulting in improved blood perfusion [66]. This should
decrease hypoxia and increase drug accessibility. He
hypothesized that therapies administrated during the
window of normalization might achieve greater efficacy.
On the other hand, high doses of anti-VEGF/R agents
could cause a rapid reduction in blood perfusion with
consequent hypoxia, resulting in increased metastatic
potential and resistance to drugs [66]. No clinical data
directly comparing the dose effect of anti-VEGF agents
on perfusion or oxygen levels are present in the literature.
However, several studies have reported that Bev
treatment results in vascular normalization. A study on
colorectal cancer patients with liver metastases given
neoadjuvant chemotherapy and Bev showed that treatment
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

resulted in tumor vessel stabilization, leading to more
mature, stable vessels with an increased diameter, whilst
also decreasing vascular density and increasing necrosis
[92].

MONITORING HYPOXIA DURING
ANTIANGIOGENIC
TREATMENTS
COULD HAVE A PREDICTIVE ROLE
The three main vascular responses to antiangiogenic therapy have already been described using
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI): reduced perfusion,
no perfusion response and increased perfusion [93-95].
Some studies have used MRI as a method to evaluate
patient response to anti-angiogenic therapy in different
solid tumors including colorectal cancer [93, 95-99].
Likewise, in another study a rapid decrease in tumor
perfusion was observed after Bev, and associated with
a decrease of VEGF expression [94]. As the observed
decrease in perfusion in tumors was probably too rapid
to be solely ascribed to inhibition of tumor angiogenesis,
vasoconstrictive effects of anti-angiogenic drugs on
tumor vessels, particularly those from the host, should be
considered as a potential underlying mechanism. In this
regard, inhibition of endothelial nitric oxide synthesis by
VEGF inhibitors may be considered an important factor.
In this context, our recent results have demonstrated a
significant association of specific endothelial nitric oxide
synthase gene polymorphisms with response, PFS and OS
of mCRC patients treated with Bev-based chemotherapy
[100], suggesting a possible connection between the
activity of this protein and the antiangiogenic drug
efficacy.
Other studies reported vascular normalization at
the start of therapy in about half of the patients, whereas
the other half reported reduced perfusion or no perfusion
response [95, 101]. Moreover, a rise in survival effects
was identified in patients who showed a higher tumor
perfusion after anti-angiogenic therapy, due to increased
chemotherapeutic delivery [95]. In particular, the
authors of this study developed a technique called vessel
architectural imaging (VAI) to measure ΔSO2 (the fraction
saturation of hemoglobin with oxygen), that is a parameter
sensitive to changes in blood oxygenation reflecting the
relative difference between arteriole and venule oxygen
saturation levels, and, as a consequence, tissue oxygen
consumption. By using this parameter they demonstrated
that patients responding to cediranib (an anti-angiogenic
drug) were those with increased perfusion and higher
delivery of oxygen to the tumor [95].
Additional clinical study should be performed to
clarify the role of tumor perfusion in monitoring response
to anti-angiogenic agents.

previous in vitro study demonstrated that the combination
of Bev with topotecan, another camptothecin that inhibits
HIF-1α translation through DNA damage-independent
mechanisms [114], had a more remarkable therapeutic
effect compared to the single drugs alone in a xenograft
model of glioblastoma [115]. The authors reported a
strong tumor proliferation inhibition and induction
of apoptosis, and highlighted the potentiality of this
combination approach, suggesting further investigation of
this therapeutic strategy in future clinical trials.
A number of ongoing clinical trials are
evaluating the effects of these combination approaches
(ClinicalTrials.gov).
A recent phase I trial was carried out to study the
combining effect of Bev plus bortezomib, an agent that
suppresses HIF-1α transcriptional activity, in patients with
different solid tumors [116]. The study showed that the
treatment was well-tolerated and that 12% of patients had
a clinical benefit (partial response or stable disease for
more than 6 months).
One phase I clinical trial is studying the effect of
Bev in combination with the mTOR inhibitor MLN0128
(NCT02142803) in glioblastoma and other solid tumors.
Targeting mTOR has a twofold effect, as it upregulates
HIF expression and is an independent metabolism
regulator [117].
There are 4 phase I/II clinical trials combining
the hypoxia activated prodrug TH-302, an alkylating
agent with an anti-angiogenic therapy in a variety of
tumors (NCT01497444, NCT01381822, NCT01403610,
NCT01485042) [118]. TH-302 enhances the activity
of a wide range of conventional anti-neoplastic agents
in a broad panel of in vivo xenograft models, including
colorectal cancer models [118].	
More recently, salternamide A was identified as
an inhibitor of HIF-1α accumulation under hypoxic
conditions in cancer cells and was shown to have an antiproliferative effect on HCT116 colorectal cancer cells.
Thus, it could be a leading candidate for the development
of anticancer agents and could be considered for use in
combination with an AI [119].
The synergistic effect observed with the use of
chemotherapy in combination with Bev could also be
attributable to the fact that chemotherapy itself is a potent
anti-angiogenic agent, and Bev, by blocking VEGF
activity, could inhibit the resistance-response induced by
the chemotherapeutic agent, sensitizing both endothelial
and cancer cells to therapy [120].

dehydrogenase (LDH) levels and the tumor-driven
angiogenesis pathway through the abnormal activation
of HIF-1α is well established. HIF-1α is an important
transcription factor that upregulates a series of genes
involved in glycolytic metabolism, angiogenesis,
cell survival and erythropoiesis. Among others, HIF1α also regulates activates transcription of several
glycolytic enzymes, such as LDH [102]. As LDH and
pro-angiogenesis factors are regulated by the same
HIF-1α-driven molecular pathway, high LDH levels are
concomitantly present along with abnormal activation
of the VEGF pathway [103]. Accordingly, Azuma et al
demonstrated that high LDH serum levels were associated
with tumor overexpression of VEGF-A and VEGFR-1
in mCRC patients [104]. It has also been speculated
that LDH levels may represent an indirect indicator of
activated tumor angiogenesis and of worse prognosis [105,
106]. A study by Scartozzi et al suggested that mCRC
patients treated with Bev and showing high pre-treatment
LDH serum levels experienced an improved probability
of response and an equivalent median PFS and OS when
compared with patients with lower LDH serum levels
[107]. Moreover, together with other research teams we
demonstrated that mCRC patients with high LDH levels
have a poor prognosis, and that the addition of Bev seems
to improve prognosis of this group of patients, assimilating
it to that of patients with low LDH levels [108, 109].
Similarly, Bar et al showed that high total serum LDH
correlated with shorter PFS, and high hypoxia-related
LDH isoenzymes correlated with worse PFS and OS, in
patients treated with either cediranib or Bev [110].
Other preliminary results from our laboratory
showed that high pretreatment level of HIF-1α were
associated with a low response rate in mCRC patients
treated with Bev-based chemotherapy [111].

RATIONALE FOR COMBINATION
TREATMENT STRATEGIES
Given that hypoxia seems to represent a resistance
mechanism to anti-angiogenic treatment, combination
strategies using a concomitant treatment with antiangiogenic drugs and inhibitors of hypoxia could be
promising.
Results obtained in first-line treatment of mCRC
have shown significant results using combination
strategies with Bev and chemotherapeutic regimens
containing irinotecan [2]. The synergism observed with
this combination approach may be attributed also to the
ability of camptothecin to inhibit HIF-1α [112] , reducing
part of the resistance mechanisms to Bev. Accordingly, a
completed phase I clinical trial on different solid tumors
combined Bev with the camptothecin analogue EZN2208 (PEGylated SN38). The authors reported a reduction
in HIF-1α protein levels in tumor biopsies compared to
baseline in 5 of 7 patients considered [113]. Similarly, a

CONCLUSIONS
Anti-angiogenic therapy is based on the concept that
angiogenesis is required for tumor growth: destruction
of the tumor vasculature would deprive the tumor of
oxygen and nutrients, inducing cell growth inhibition.
However, as tumor vasculature is structurally abnormal
46685

Oncotarget

and functionally inefficient, the resultant hypoxic
microenvironment is associated with tumor progression
and resistance to therapies. Therapeutic destruction of
the tumor vasculature is expected to yield more severe
hypoxia. Hypoxia, in turn, is able to induce additional
angiogenic responses through the activation of HIF1α, to drive genetic alteration responsible for malignant
progression, and to modulate the immune system inducing
immune-escape.
AI in combination with chemotherapy are the
standard of care in mCRC patients. Unfortunately, there
are no biomarkers that can be used as predictor of response
and resistance.
The detection of the onset of resistance to AI is
becoming increasingly important, in the light of recent data
supporting treatment with AI even beyond progression.
In this context, hypoxia could play an important role, as
mentioned before.
Combination strategies of AI with agents able to
inhibit hypoxia could be very promising. In mCRC, the
efficacy demonstrated with the combination of AI and
irinotecan-based chemotherapy could be also attributed
to the capacity of camptothecin to inhibit HIF-1α. This
strategy could improve the efficacy of anti-angiogenic
treatments in mCRC and in other types of cancer.
In summary, hypoxia may represent an important
parameter to assess during the course of anti-angiogenic
treatment, and it could be useful in monitoring response
and determining resistance. Further studies are needed to
define its role in the definition of combination strategies
of therapy.
