ABSTRACT
Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a chemotherapy-resistant brain tumor with
limited treatment options. Temozolomide (TMZ), an alkylating agent, is a front-line
chemotherapeutic drug currently employed in GBM. Although it is currently the most
promising chemotherapy for GBM, resistance to TMZ is also common and accounts for
many treatment failures. Therefore, understanding the underlying mechanisms that
generate resistance is essential to develop more effective chemotherapies. Here, we
show that microRNA-101 (miR-101) was significantly downregulated in TMZ-resistant
GBM cells and human specimens. Instead, over-expression of miR-101 could sensitize
resistant GBM cells to TMZ through downregulation of glycogen synthase kinase 3β
(GSK3β). Moreover, we found that GSK3β inhibition could enhance TMZ effect through
repression of MGMT via promoter methylation. Importantly, decreased expression of
miR-101 is related to poor prognosis in patients with GBM, suggesting its potential
role as a new prognostic marker in GBM. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that
miR-101 can reverse TMZ resistance by inhibition of GSK3β in GBM, thus offer a novel
and powerful strategy for GBM therapy.

[9]; however, the mechanisms are still largely unknown.
Therefore, understanding the underlying molecular
mechanisms that generate resistance is essential to develop
more effective chemotherapies.
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small
noncoding RNAs proposed to have important roles in the
regulation of diverse cellular processes [10]. In recent
years, miRNAs have gained significant attention in
proliferation, aggressiveness and metastases development
of cancer [11]. Increasing evidence has suggested that
miRNAs are involved in the development and progression
of GBM [12–14]. MicroR-101 (miR-101), which functions
as a tumor suppressor, is downregulated in a variety of
malignancies including GBM [14]. Studies show that
downregulation of miR-101 can induce the proliferation,
migration, and angiogenesis of GBM cells [15, 16].

INTRODUCTION
Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), also known as
glioblastoma and grade IV astrocytoma, is characterized
by a heterogeneous population of cells that are genetically
unstable, highly infiltrative, angiogenic, and resistant
to chemotherapy [1–3]. Temozolomide (TMZ) is a
standard chemotherapeutic drug currently employed
in the therapy of GBM [4, 5]. It is an alkylating agent
that induces apoptosis through DNA strand breaks [6].
Although chemotherapy with TMZ may enhance survival
for patients with GBM, intrinsic or acquired resistance to
TMZ is also common and accounts for many treatment
failures [7, 8]. Various studies have been conducted to
investigate how GBM cells acquire resistance to TMZ

Hence, we speculate that miR-101 may participate in the
regulation of TMZ resistance in GBM.
In the present study, we found that miR-101 was
significantly downregulated in TMZ- resistant GBM
cells, and its re-expression could reverse TMZ resistance
through regulation of a serine/threonine protein kinase,
glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β)[17, 18].

We further validated these results by quantitative reverse
transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) in both A172-TR and
U251-TR cell lines (Figure 1B and 1C).
We next sought to determine whether these seven
miRNAs were dysregulated in the recurrent TMZrefractory GBM. To address this question, we examined
the expression of these seven miRNAs in tumor samples
obtained from matched pairs of primary and recurrent
TMZ-refractory GBM from 12 patients. Among them,
three miRNAs (miR-29c, miR-93 and miR-101) were
downregulated and two (miR-9 and miR-182) were
upregulated in the TMZ-refractory samples as compared
with that in the primary tumor samples (p<0.05, Figure
1D). The expression of two other miRNAs (miR-130a and
miR-221) didn’t change significantly (p>0.05). Because
of the largest fold change of miR-101 among the three
downregulated miRNAs, we chosen miR-101 for the
subsequent studies.

RESULTS
MicroR-101 is downregulated in TMZ-resistant
GBM cells and human specimens
To explore the role of miRNAs in the development
of TMZ resistance, we first established two TMZ-resistant
GBM cell lines using A172 and U251 cells (A172-TR
and U251-TR), and then performed a miRNA PCR array
representing 84 mature miRNAs associated with brain
tumorigenesis to compare miRNA expression changes
in TMZ-resistant cells and its parental cells. Seven
miRNAs (downregulated: miR-29c, miR-93, miR-101
and miR-130a; upregulated: miR-9, miR-182 and miR221) were identified as differentially expressed (≥2-fold)
in both A172-TR and U251-TR cell lines (Figure 1A).

we next examined whether re-expression of miR-101
could sensitize the resistant GBM cells to TMZ. To
address this question, TMZ-resistant U251-TR cell lines
were transduced with miR-101 and then treated with
different concentrations of TMZ. Results showed that
forced miR-101 expression rendered U251-TR cells
more sensitive to TMZ. The half maximal inhibitory
concentration (IC50) values of U251-TR cells transduced
with vector control and miR-101 are (165.0±52.5) μM
and (22.4±4.5) μM, respectively (Figure 2A). The flow
cytometry assay showed that U251-TR cells transduced
with miR-101 exhibited increased cell apoptosis when
compared with the vector control group (Figure 2B). We
further performed colony formation assay. As shown in
Figure 2C, in the absence of TMZ, miR-101 alone could
decrease the number of colonies of U251-TR cells.
Moreover, miR-101 sensitized U251-TR cells to TMZ

treatment, as indicated by significantly decreased number
of colony formation (Figure 2C). We also assessed the
effect of miR-101 inhibition on TMZ resistance in A172
cells. The results showed that inhibition of miR-101 led
to decreased cell apoptosis after TMZ treatment (Figure
2D and Supplementary Figure S3A). It suggested that
suppression of miR-101 might render GBM cells resistant
to TMZ in vitro.
We further evaluated the effect of miR-101 on
TMZ resistance in vivo. TMZ-resistant U251-TR cells
stably transduced with either miR-101 or vector control
were injected subcutaneously into two groups of nude
mice (n=5). The mice were injected intraperitoneally with
TMZ (20 mg/kg/day) every three days after two weeks
of implantation. As expected, the tumor growth curve
showed that tumors derived from miR-101 group grew
more slowly than those from the vector control group. In

the absence of TMZ, the tumor volumes of miR-101 group
and vector control group were (0.36 ± 0.07) cm3 and (0.68
± 0.10) cm3, respectively (*, p<0.05; Figure 2E). Upon
TMZ treatment, the tumor volumes of miR-101 group and
vector control group were (0.14 ± 0.09) cm3 and (0.42 ±
0.08) cm3, respectively (*, p<0.05; Figure 2E). Moreover,
in the presence of TMZ, the mean tumor weight was
significantly lower in the miR-101 group (0.15 ± 0.02 g)
compared to that of the vector control group (0.36 ±0.04
g; *, p<0.05; Figure 2F and Supplementary Figure S3B).

the potential target genes of miR-101. Besides of GSK3β,
other genes such as VEGF and COX-2 have been reported
to be targets of miR-101 [19, 20]. However, due to the
critical role of GSK3β in TMZ resistance in GBM [21,
22], we chose it for the following studies. As shown in
Figure 3A, the predicted binding sites of miR-101 in the
3’-UTR of GSK3β were conserved from various species.
To determine whether GSK3β is a direct target gene of
miR-101, luciferase reporters fused to wild-type or mutant
3’-UTRs of GSK3β were constructed. Luciferase reporter
assay demonstrated that exogenous miR-101 repressed the
luciferase activity of wild-type 3’-UTR of GSK3β, but not
the luciferase activity of mutant 3’-UTR of GSK3β. By
contrast, inhibition of miR-101 by transfection of A172
cells with anti-miR-101 oligonucleotides increased the
activity of luciferase reporter fused to the wild-type 3’UTRs of GSK3β but not the mutant (*, p<0.05; Figure
3B). Furthermore, forced expression of miR-101 in A172
cells reduced GSK3β expression at both the mRNA
and protein levels (Figure 3C), whereas suppression of
miR-101 enhanced the expression of GSK3β (Figure

GSK3β is a direct target of miR-101
To identify potential target genes of miR-101, we
performed in silico analysis by using the publicly available
databases miRanda, DIANA-microT and TargetScan
(Supplementary Figure S2). GSK3β, the gene involved in
the regulation of protein synthesis, glycogen metabolism,
cell proliferation and survival, was predicted to be one of

3D). The relative expression of miR-101 was shown in
Supplementary Figure S1. To confirm the above findings,
we analyzed the correlation between miR-101 and GSK3β
in GBM samples (n=70). The expression of miR-101 and
GSK3β was determined by qRT-PCR. The expression of
miR-101 was found to be inversely correlated with GSK3β
in the GBM samples (Spearman r: -0.307, p=0.01; Figure
3E). The immunochemistry assay also showed that GBM
samples with lower level expression of miR-101 exhibited
obvious higher expression of GSK3β (*, p<0.05; Figure
3F). Collectively, these results indicated that GSK3β was
a direct target of miR-101 in glioblastoma cells.

To further evaluate the functional role of GSK3β in
miR-101-mediated chemosensitization, we over-expressed
GSK3β in TMZ-resistant U251-TR cells transduced with
miR-101, and treated those cells with TMZ. The flow
cytometry assay showed that U251-TR cells transduced
with miR-101 exhibited increased cell apoptosis compared
with vector control; however, the increased cell apoptosis
caused by miR-101 was attenuated significantly by ectopic
over-expression of GSK3β (*, p<0.05; Figure 4A). A
similar result was also got from the colony formation

assay. miR-101 sensitized resistant U251-TR cells to
TMZ treatment, as demonstrated by the decreased colony
number formation after ectopic expression of miR-101,
whereas GSK3β rescued miR-101-induced cell growth
inhibition (*, p<0.05; Figure 4B and Supplementary
Figure S3C). These findings were further confirmed by
the subsequent protein changes shown in Figure 4C. After
exposure to TMZ, expression of both cleaved-PARP and
cleaved-Caspase 9 were increased in cells transduced
with miR-101, and significantly decreased after forced
over-expression of GSK3β (Figure 4C). Furthermore, we
knocked down the endogenous GSK3β expression in A172
cells transduced with anti-miR-101 or scrambled antisense
miRNA control (anti-control), and treated those cells with
TMZ. Cell growth assay showed that suppression of miR101 rendered A172 cells resistant to TMZ treatment,
whereas knockdown of endogenous GSK3β remarkably
sensitized these cells to TMZ (*, p<0.05; Figure 4D).
It has been reported that GSK3β inhibition could
enhance TMZ effect by silencing O6-methylguanine DNA
methyltransferase (MGMT) expression via promoter
methylation [22]. Therefore, we evaluated whether
inhibition of GSK3β could affect MGMT expression
in this study. We first examined the changes of MGMT
expression after knockdown of endogenous GSK3β
in GBM cells. As shown in Figure 4E, both the mRNA
and protein expression of MGMT were repressed after
inhibition of GSK3β (*, p<0.05). To test the effect of
GSK3β inhibition on the methylation of MGMT promoter,
we performed a MethyLight assay. The results indicated
that GSK3β inhibition significantly increased MGMT
promoter methylation (*, p<0.05; Figure 4F). Collectively,
these results suggested that miR-101 sensitized resistant
GBM cells to TMZ through downregulation of GSK3β.

significantly shorter progression-free survival (p=0.029).
Moreover, patients with lower expression of miR-101
showed a shorter overall survival as compared with those
with higher expression of miR-101 (p=0.017). Taken
together, these results suggested that downregulation of
miR-101 predicted worse prognosis in GBM patients.

DISCUSSION
TMZ is the current first-line chemotherapeutic
drug in the treatment of GBM. Resistance to TMZ is a
major challenge in GBM therapy [7, 9, 23, 24]. Here, we
describe that miRNA-101 may participate in the regulation
of TMZ resistance in GBM. In this paper, we show that
miR-101 is downregulated in TMZ-resistant GBM cells
and human specimens, which is consistent with previous
reports in other cancers [25–27]. We also find that miR101 could sensitize resistant GBM cells to TMZ through
downregulation of GSK3β. Importantly, decreased
expression of miR-101 is related to poor prognosis in
patients with GBM, suggesting that miR-101 can be used
as a prognostic molecular marker.
MicroR-101 is a tumor suppressor dysregulated in
various malignancies including liver cancer, pancreatic
cancer, gastric cancer, lung cancer and ovarian carcinoma,
etc [25, 28–34]. In our study, we also found that miR101 alone could suppress cell growth of GBM. Various
studies have shown that downregulation of miRNA-101 is
involved in chemoresistance of several cancers [35–37].
It has been reported that downregulation of miR-101
contributes to cisplatin resistance of non-small cell lung
cancer cells by targeting ROCK2 [36], miR-101 sensitizes
liver cancer cells to doxorubicin-induced cell death
through targeting Mcl-1 [38], and miR-101 can enhance
chemosensitivity in epithelial ovarian cancer [34]. We
confirm that miR-101 also plays a key role in the TMZ
resistance of GBM.
While specific miRNAs are well known to be
dysregulated in many cancers, correction of these miRNAs
using miRNA mimics or antagomiRs could normalize the
gene regulatory network and reverse chemoresistance to
anti-cancer drugs [39, 40]. MicroRNA based therapeutics
appears to be a promising candidate for the development
of novel anti-cancer agents, and have been tested in both
preclinical and clinical settings [11, 41–43]. Our study
has revealed that miR-101 is downregulated and involved
in chemoresistance of GBM, it is therefore reasonable to
infer that restoration of miR-101 expression may reverse
chemoresistance to anti-cancer drugs. Interestingly,
our study proves that over-expression of miR-101 does
sensitize resistant GBM tumor xenografts to TMZ
treatment in vivo.
GSK3β is a serine/threonine protein kinase
involved in the regulation of protein synthesis, glycogen
metabolism, cell proliferation and survival [44, 45]. It
is also an important component of diverse signaling

Downregulation of miR-101 in GBM patients
predicts worse prognosis
We investigated the relationship between the
expression of miR-101 and clinical characteristics in
patients with GBM. As shown in Table 1, no association
of miR-101 expression with age, gender, Karnofsky
performance score (KPS), tumor size and treatment
(resection, chemotherapy and radiotherapy) was found
in patients with GBM. However, remarkable correlation
of miR-101 expression with differentiation degree of
tumor (p=0.017) and disease recurrence (p=0.008) was
demonstrated (Table 1). To determine the prognostic value
of miR-101 for GBM, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis of
patients with GBM was conducted, and log-rank test were
performed to evaluate the statistical significance between
stratified groups according to the expression of miR-101.
MicroR-101 high expression group (miR-101 high) was
defined as patients with higher expression level of miR101 than average and vice versa. As shown in the Figure
5A, patients with lower expression of miR-101 had a

pathways including Wnt/β-catenin, insulin, Notch, and
Hedgehog signaling pathways [46]. Studies show that it
plays a critical role in the development and progression
of various malignancies. It has been demonstrated that
targeting GSK3β may represent a novel strategy for the
treatment of chemoresistant cancers [44]. For instance,
downregulation of GSK3β could re-sensitize drug-resistant
cells to chemotherapy [47], enhanced expression of
GSK3 is associated with acquired resistance to paclitaxel
in ovarian cancer [48, 49], and GSK3β inhibition can
sensitize human glioblastoma cells to TMZ [22]. In our
study, GSK3β is found to be a direct target of miR-101,
and miR-101 could sensitize resistant GBM cells to TMZ
through downregulation of GSK3β. Moreover, we find
that GSK3β inhibition could enhance TMZ effect through
repression of MGMT via promoter methylation, which is
consistent with previous study that GSK3β could affect
MGMT promoter methylation status via c-Myc signaling
[22]. It’s important to note that GSK3β plays a dual role
in GBM either as a tumor suppressor and tumor promoter.
For example, Miyashita et al showed that GSK3β could
promote the survival and proliferation of GBM cells
and inhibit apoptosis through p53 and/or Rb-mediated
pathways [21]. Chikano et al reported that GSK3β
enhances invasion of GBM via the focal adhesion kinase,
Rac1, and JNK pathway [50]. A recent study revealed that
GSK3β could inhibit glioma progression via regulation of
mTOR/p70S6K1 signaling pathway [51]. This discrepancy
may result from at least in part depends on the signaling
environment. The dysregulated downstream effector of
GSK3β could have a considerable impact on cell fate and
function.
In summary, we have identified that miR-101 is
downregulated in TMZ-resistant GBM, rendering GBM
cells resistant to TMZ treatment. On the other hand, overexpression of miR-101 can sensitize resistant GBM tumor
xenografts to TMZ in vivo. It not only yields a better
understanding of the underlying mechanisms of miR-101
in TMZ-resistant in GBM, but also paves a new way for
novel and powerful anticancer therapeutics. Alternatively,
downregulation of miR-101 in GBM patients predicts
worse prognosis, suggesting its potential use as a new
prognostic marker in GBM.

Cell culture and transfections
A172, T98G and U-251MG cells were purchased
from Cell bank of Chinese Academy of Sciences
(Shanghai, China). Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's
modified Eagle's medium (Hyclone, Logan, UT, USA)
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone,
Logan, UT, USA), 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, and 100
units/ml penicillin (Invitrogen, California, USA) in 5%
CO2 atmosphere at 37°C. Transfection was performed
using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions
as previously described. The miR-101 mimics, antimiR-101, GSK3βsiRNA, and their scramble controls were
synthesized by Sangon (Shanghai, China).

Establishment of TMZ-resistant cell lines
The TMZ-resistant cell lines were established as
previously reported [52]. Briefly, A172 and U251 cells
were exposed to a low dose of TMZ in culture media for
6 months and established TMZ -resistant cells designated
as A172-TR and U251-TR, respectively. IC50 value was
altered at least 7 to 10 folds increase in TMZ-resistant
cells. TMZ was purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO)
and dissolved in DMSO.

Lentivirus tranduction
Lentiviral production, titration, and infection were
performed as previously described [53]. Briefly, lentiviral
plasmids pLV-THM expressing miR-101 or vector control
was cotransfected with psPAX2 and pMD2.G plasmids
in 293T cells. Lentiviral particles were harvested from
the media after 48 hours of transfection, and purified
with ultracentrifugation. Cells were then infected with
lentiviruses encoding miR-101 or vector control and
prepared for the further experiments. Over-expression of
miR-101 was confirmed by real-time qPCR analysis.

RNA extraction and real-time PCR

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy mini kit
according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Qiagen,
Germany). The quantity and purity of RNA was quantified
by NanoDrop 1000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific,
Wilmington, DE, USA). cDNA was prepared using the
SuperScript® III First-Strand Synthesis System according
to the manufacturer’s instructions (Invitrogen, California,
USA). Quantitative PCR was performed using SYBR
Green dye on an Applied Biosystems 7300 Real-time
PCR system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The
relative gene expression was determined by 2-ΔΔCT method.

Tissue samples
The primary and recurrent TMZ-refractory GBM
samples were obtained at the First Affiliated Hospital of
Zhengzhou University from 2011 to 2016. Tissues were
flash frozen immediately after surgery. These samples
were collected at the time of diagnosis. All data including
age, gender, Karnofsky performance score, tumor size,
differentiation degree and locations were obtained from

using the following equation: H-score =ΣPi (i + 1), where
i is the intensity score (which ranged 0 ~ 3), and Pi is
the percentage of stained tumor cells at each intensity
(0% ~ 100%). This formula produces a score that ranges
100 ~ 400, where 100 indicate that 100% of tumor cells
were negative and 400 indicates that 100% of tumor cells
were strongly stained. The median H-score of GSK3β was
used as the cut-off to divide the study cohort into high
expression and low expression groups.

Luciferase reporter assays
Luciferase reporter assays were performed as
previously reported [54]. Cells were co-transfected with
synthetic miR-101 or anti-miR-101, the wild-type or
mutant 3'UTR of GSK3β luciferase reporter vector pGL3GSK3-3'UTR and pRL vector coding for the Renilla
luciferase (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). 48 to 72 hours
later, cells were collected and luciferase activities were
measured using the Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay
System (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.

Cell proliferation assay

Bioinformatics analysis and target prediction

Cell proliferation was determined by Cell Counting
Kit-8 assay (Dojindo Laboratories, Kumamoto, Japan)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Cells were
plated in 96-well plates and incubated for different periods
of time and then added 10 μL of CCK-8 in each well. After
incubation for 2 h at 37°C, the absorbance at 450 nm was
read on an ELISA plate reader (Model 680, Bio-Rad, CA).

To predict the binding site of miR-101 and GSK3β,
prediction algorithms, including TargetScan (http://
www.targetscan.org/vert_71/), DIANA-microT (http://
diana.imis.athena-innovation.gr/DianaTools/index.php?
r=microT_CDS/index) and microRNA.org (http://
www.microrna.org/microrna/home.do) were used for
bioinformatics analysis.

Western blotting

Colony formation assay

Western blot analysis was performed as
previously described [54]. Briefly, cells were lysed in
cold RIPA buffer, proteins (20μg) were resolved on
SDS-PAGE, transferred onto PVDF membranes, and
probed with antibodies for GSK3β (sc-9166, Santa
Cruz Biotechnology), cleaved-PAPR (#9541, Cell
Signaling Technology), cleaved-Caspase 9 (#9501,
Cell Signaling Technology), MGMT (sc-48805, Santa
Cruz Biotechnology), and GAPDH (sc-32233, Santa
Cruz Biotechnology) at 4°C overnight. Detection was
performed with an enhanced chemiluminescence kit
(Santa Cruz, Dallas, TX, USA). The band images were
digitally captured and quantified with an Image Lab
Software (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA).

1.0 × 103 cells were seeded into 6-well plates (in
triplicates) in 2 ml of complete growth medium. The
medium of each well was changed every three days. Two
to three weeks later, cells were stained by 0.1% crystal
violet (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) in methanol
for 10 min. The colonies more than 50μm were counted
directly on the plate. Statistical significance was calculated
from at least three independent experiments.

MethyLight assay
Genomic DNA was extracted using a QIAamp DNA
Mini Kit and subjected to bisulfite conversion using an
EpiTect Bisulfite Kit according to the manufacturer’s
instructions (Qiagen, Germany). MethyLight analysis
was performed using the primers and fluorescent probes
specific for bisulfite-converted DNA. The primers and
probe specific to methylated fraction of the MGMT
promoter were taken from previous study [22]. (Probe,
6FAM-CCTTACCTCTAAATACCAACCCCAAACCCGBHQ-1; forward primer, 5’-CTAACGTATAACGAAAAT
CGTAACAACC-3’; reverse primer, 5’-AGTATGGAAG
GGTAGGAAGAATTCG-3’). Alu was used as reference
(probe, 6FAM-CCTACCTTAACCTCCC-BHQ-1; forward
primer, 5’-GGTTAGGTATAGTGGTTTATATTTGTAAT
TTTAGTA-3’; reverse primer, 5’-ATTAACTAAACTA
ATCTTAAACTCCTAACCTCA-3’). The samples were
amplified by using the Epitect MethyLight Mastermix

Immunochemistry
The paraformalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded GBM
sections were immunostained using the Dako EnVision™
Flex+ System (K8012; Dako, Glostrup, Denmark).
Deparaffinization and epitope unmasking were carried
out in a PT-Link using an EnVision™ Flex target retrieval
solution (Dako, Carpinteria, CA, USA). The sections were
treated with 0.3% hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) for 5 min to
block endogenous peroxidase. Sections were incubated
overnight at 4°C with GSK3β (1:100; sc-9166, Santa Cruz
Biotechnology). The specimens were subsequently treated
with EnVision™ Flex linker rabbit (15 min), EnVision™
Flex/HRP enzyme (30 min), and 3′3-diaminobenzidine

Tumor xenograft models
Mouse xenograft model were performed as
described previously [55]. Briefly, Six to eight weeks
old athymic BALB/c nude mice were purchased from
Beijing Vital River Laboratory Animal Technology
(Beijing, China). The mice were randomly distributed
into two groups. TMZ-resistant U251-TR cells stably
transduced with either miR-101 or vector control were
injected subcutaneously into two groups of nude mice
(n = 5). The mice were injected intraperitoneally with
TMZ (20 mg/kg/day) every three days after two weeks of
implantation. The tumor size was measured with calipers
every three days, and tumor volume was calculated using
the formula (Length × Width2/2). Five to six weeks after
implantation, the xenograft tumor began to appear at
the site of implantation with 0.5 to 1.0 cm3 in volume.
Mice were euthanized by asphyxiation in a CO2 chamber
and tumors were excised using standard procedure. All
animal experiments were conducted with the approval
of the Animal Care and Use Committee of Zhengzhou
University.
