Mechanisms of Resistance to Intermittent Androgen
Deprivation in Patients with Prostate Cancer Identiﬁed by a
Novel Computational Method

Abstract
For progressive prostate cancer, intermittent androgen deprivation (IAD) is one of the most common and
effective treatments. Although this treatment is usually initially effective at regressing tumors, most patients
eventually develop castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), for which there is no effective treatment
and is generally fatal. Although several biologic mechanisms leading to CRPC development and their relative
frequencies have been identiﬁed, it is difﬁcult to determine which mechanisms of resistance are developing
in a given patient. Personalized therapy that identiﬁes and targets speciﬁc mechanisms of resistance
developing in individual patients is likely one of the most promising methods of future cancer therapy.
Prostate-speciﬁc antigen (PSA) is a biomarker for monitoring tumor progression. We incorporated a cell
death rate (CDR) function into a previous dynamical PSA model that was highly accurate at ﬁtting clinical
PSA data for 7 patients. The mechanism of action of IAD is largely induction of apoptosis, and each
mechanism of resistance varies in its CDR dynamics. Thus, we analyze the CDR levels and their timedependent oscillations to identify mechanisms of resistance to IAD developing in individual patients. Cancer

Introduction
Major Findings
Here, we introduce a novel computational method called
cell death rate (CDR) analysis that uses a mathematical
model validated by clinical data to identify the major
mechanism of treatment resistance developing in a given
patient. Although CDR analysis may be applicable to other
cancers, we use it here to predictively diagnose the major
mechanism of castration resistance developing in individual patients with prostate cancer after a period of IAD.
Our results are consistent with biologic literature, and
this mathematical method using CDR analysis may significantly improve personalized treatment of CRPC and other
cancers.

Prostate cancer and treatment
In this work, we limit our attention to prostatic adenocarcinomas of non-neuroendocrine origin as this entity has
by far the greatest clinical signiﬁcance of all prostate tumors.
Healthy prostatic epithelial cells and most malignant prostatic epithelial cells exhibit some degree of dependence on
androgens, including testosterone and dihydrotestosterone
(DHT), for proliferation and survival (1–5). The contribution
androgens provide to cell proliferation and survival is mediated by the androgen receptor (AR) axis. It is well known
that AR signaling regulates expression of genes involved in
proliferation and survival and is generally accepted to be the
primary driver of tumor progression in adenocarcinomas
(1, 2, 4–7). AR signaling inhibition, therefore, regresses
tumors (2, 4, 8, 9).
The most common and effective treatment for progressive
prostate cancer is androgen-deprivation therapy (5, 6). The
mechanism of action of this therapy is largely induction of
apoptosis, contingent on prostate cancer cells being dependent on androgens, via the AR axis, for survival (2–5). Androgen deprivation can be accomplished by surgical castration
(orchiectomy) or chemical castration (with drugs). The latter
method is commonly carried out by "total androgen blockade," which combines luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) analogues and antiandrogens (10). Chemical
castration is almost universally effective at regressing tumors
initially; however, almost all patients eventually develop resistance to treatment and advance to a more aggressive stage, for
which there is no effective treatment (5, 6, 10, 11). This

Quick Guide to Equations and Assumptions
This study builds off of the previous work by Jackson, Ideta and colleagues, and especially Portz and colleagues. As these authors
did, we model two populations of prostate cancer cells within a single patient. One population has a castration-sensitive (CS)
phenotype and the other is castration resistant (CR). For simplicity, we will refer to these different populations as "strains." The
sizes of each strain at time t are represented by X1(t) and X2(t). Dynamics of these populations are modeled by the following system
of ordinary differential equations:

where Xi ðtÞ represents the size of the ith strain at time t. (See Table 1 for a comprehensive list of parameter interpretations and
values.) Cell population dynamics are driven by intracellular concentration, or cell quota, of bound androgen receptors (AR),
which we denote Qi ðtÞ. Here, i 2 f1; 2g refers to the strain identity. Androgen is viewed as an ecologic resource on which both
proliferation and cell mortality depend. As did Portz and colleagues, we represent androgen-dependent proliferation using an
established formalism from mathematical ecology called the Droop model. In this context, the Droop form for per capita

proliferation rate of strain i becomes mm 1  Qqi , where positive constants mm and qi represent maximum proliferation rate and
i

minimum cell quota required for proliferation, respectively. Because strains 1 and 2 are CS and CR, respectively, and because CR
cells are less dependent on androgens and can proliferate at aberrantly low levels of serum androgen, we assume that q2 < q1 .
Portz and colleagues assume a constant per capita mortality rate for both strains. However, androgen-deprivation therapy
works not only by inhibiting growth and proliferation, but also by inducing apoptosis in prostate cancer cells. To capture this
reality, we represent per capita mortality in the ith strain as the following CDR function:

The ﬁrst term on the right-hand side expresses androgen-dependent apoptosis, where positive constants Ri and a are shape

sensitively apoptosis responds to changes in cell quota. Positive constants di are the maximal apoptosis rates induced by complete
absence of bound ARs. Finally, positive constants di represent androgen-independent cell mortality.

Here, we interpret the meaning of Q(t) slightly differently than did Portz and colleagues. Because Qi(t) is the (average) bound AR

processes: androgen–AR binding inside the cell and cellular regulation of AR concentration. With this interpretation, A(t) is the

concentration of intraprostatic androgen, which essentially freely diffuses between interstitial and cytosolic compartments, and is
interpolated using the same method as Portz and colleagues. Androgen–AR binding is assumed to be a Michaelis–Menten process
with rate Vmax A=ðkv þAÞ, where kv is the half-saturation constant and Vmax ¼ vm ðqm  Qi Þ=ðqm  qi Þ. Positive constant vm is the
product formation rate (rate at which enzyme–substrate complexes dissociate to release product in the classic Michaelis–Menten
formulation), whereas the quotient ðqm  Qi Þ=ðqm  qi Þ, in which qm is the maximum cell quota, is the total (bound and unbound)
AR concentration regulated such that Qi > qi for all i and t; therefore, the proliferation terms in Equations A and B cannot become
negative. Intracellular androgen degrades at the rate b, and the term mm ðQi  qi Þ accounts for growth dilution.
Serum prostate-speciﬁc antigen (PSA) is assumed to be produced by each strain at a constant baseline rate, s 0 (invariant across
phenotype), plus an androgen-dependent rate governed by a Hill function with Hill parameter m (also invariant across phenotype),
shape parameter ri and maximal PSA production rate s i, with the latter two being phenotype speciﬁc. Serum PSA degrades at a
constant per capita rate, e. These assumptions lead to the following model of serum PSA dynamics:

ðGÞ

Because PSA is only produced in epithelial cells, our model only considers epithelial cells and, thus, we only model carcinomas. The
full model comprises Equations A and B, as well as F and G.
Because IAD induces cell death only during on-treatment periods, CDRs oscillate in populations that depend on androgens for
survival. The CDR oscillation amplitude (the difference between global maximum and global minimum CDR values throughout the
entire period of intermittent treatment) reﬂects the degree of this dependence. Because each mechanism varies in its dependence
on androgens for survival, the major mechanism of treatment resistance is identiﬁed primarily by the amplitude of CDR oscillation,
Fi, which we deﬁne as:

advanced stage has traditionally been referred to as androgenindependent prostate cancer, the rationale for this terminology being that if prostate cancer cells have no androgen
access, but continue to survive and proliferate, then they
must have bypassed the need for androgens. However,
although chemical castration depletes blood serum testosterone levels by >90%, intraprostatic androgen concentrations
remain at 20% to 50% (2, 4, 5, 12). These residual intratumoral
androgen sources allow prostate cancer cells to survive
because these cells are still dependent on androgens for
survival (5). The recent clinical efﬁcacy of abiraterone (which
inhibits intraprostatic androgen synthesis) and enzalutamide
(a second-generation AR antagonist), has further conﬁrmed
that these cells are not androgen independent (5, 13, 14).
Therefore, this stage of cancer is now generally referred to as
castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC; refs. 2, 4, 5, 12, 15).
Because continuous androgen deprivation (CAD) provides a
prolonged stimulus selecting for castration-resistant clones,
intermittent androgen deprivation (IAD) was proposed to
delay the onset of CRPC (10). Although this basis for IAD
remains controversial (16), IAD is cheaper and minimizes side
effects relative to CAD (10). For detailed clinical examples of
the IAD protocol, see refs. 9, 17, 18.
The gene coding for prostate-speciﬁc antigen (PSA) is
exclusively activated by AR signaling in prostatic epithelial
cells (1, 6). PSA is secreted by these cells into the blood serum

www.aacrjournals.org

(1). Because AR signaling is considered the primary driver of
tumor progression, before and after androgen-deprivation
failure, PSA is a commonly used predictive biomarker for
monitoring androgen-deprivation efﬁcacy (1, 9). Increasing
PSA levels are characteristic of tumor progression, whereas
decreasing PSA levels are characteristic of tumor regression.
For IAD, patients are usually put on treatment until their PSA
levels fall below some threshold value, usually <4 ng/mL, and
taken off-treatment until PSA rises above some threshold level,
usually >10 ng/mL (10).
Several mathematical models have been developed with the
goal of ﬁtting model output to clinical PSA data throughout the
course of IAD (19–23). Here, we address how a mechanistic
model of prostate cancer that takes an individual patient's
serum androgen data as input, and uses data ﬁtting to clinical
PSA data to estimate parameters, might be used to inform
clinicians of the inherent mechanism(s) of treatment resistance in individual patients.
Major mechanisms of treatment resistance
Although most prostate cancer cells exhibit some degree of
dependence on androgens for survival, as tumors continue to
advance to a more progressive state, the degree of dependence
tends to decrease. Several pathways to CRPC development
have been identiﬁed with varying degrees of androgen dependence (see ref. 1 for detailed review of these mechanisms).

Later, we attempt to quantify this variation in dependence and
use it to identify which mechanism is developing in individual
patients. Clinical identiﬁcation of these mechanisms in individual tumors still suffers from a lack of maturity because
CRPC tissue is difﬁcult to obtain and study (11). Hence,
mathematical models may be a potentially powerful clinical
tool for analyzing mechanisms of CRPC development. Here, we
highlight mechanisms that lead to CRPC, which we propose
can be identiﬁed through our model.
The hypersensitivity pathway. Cells using this as their
major mechanism have a lower androgen threshold for proliferation and survival but remain completely dependent on
androgens. We consider three speciﬁc pathways to hypersensitivity: ampliﬁcation and overexpression of AR, increased AR
stability, and increased local androgen production. Overexpression of AR is characteristic of most CRPC cases (7, 15, 24). It
has been demonstrated that overexpression of wild-type AR is
adequate to fully transform a CS tumor into a CR tumor (24).
AR ampliﬁcation is one of the most common genetic aberrations to occur in CRPC (15). It has been suggested that 80% of
CRPC cases exhibit elevated AR gene copy number whereas
30% exhibit high-level ampliﬁcation (15). It has also been

3676

Cancer Res; 74(14) July 15, 2014

suggested that increased AR stability may be a mechanism
leading to CRPC (1). Increased local androgen production can
result from constitutive activation of 5a-reductase, which
converts testosterone to DHT in prostate cells. For example,
the V89L mutation in the gene coding for 5a-reductase leads to
an increase in its activity (1). Furthermore, some CRPC cells
may be able to synthesize the androgens themselves from
cholesterol or other androgenic precursors (1, 5, 6).
The promiscuous receptor pathway. Promiscuous ARs
generally arise from missense mutations in the ligand-binding
domain that decrease the speciﬁcity of the AR for a particular
ligand. These mutations broaden the group of ligands that
activate the AR, such that the AR obtains the ability to bind to
and be activated by other nonandrogen agonists in addition to
androgens (1, 4). Potential nonandrogen agonists include
estrogen, progesterone, cortisol, antiandrogens, or adrenal
androgens such as DHEA (4). For example, the most common
promiscuous AR mutation is T877A, which is endogenously
expressed in androgen-sensitive LNCaP cell lines in which it
was ﬁrst discovered (4, 12). Taplin and colleagues found the
T877A mutation to be present in 30% of prostate cancer bone
metastases (25). The T877A-mutant AR still binds to, and is,

Identifying CRPC Mechanisms in Individual Patients

thus, activated by, testosterone and DHT. However, alanine
replaces the threonine residue at position 877 and allows
ligands other than testosterone and DHT to also ﬁt in the
binding pocket and activate the receptor (12). Promiscuous
ARs with complete loss of responsiveness to androgens are
extremely rare (4). Although mutations have been identiﬁed
that reduce afﬁnity for DHT relative to the wild-type AR, nearly
all identiﬁed promiscuous ARs are still activated by DHT (4).
We, therefore, assume that all CR cells with promiscuous ARs
retain responsiveness to androgens; however, they are less
dependent on these androgens than cells with hypersensitivity.
The outlaw receptor pathway. Outlaw receptors are steroid hormone receptors that are activated by ligand-independent mechanisms. No mutations in the AR gene coding region
have been identiﬁed such that the AR is activated by ligandindependent mechanisms (1). Rather, this pathway apparently
involves the wild-type receptor or AR splice variants, because
the AR gene sequence is not changed, and may still exhibit
responsiveness to androgens. There have been several AR
splice variants identiﬁed such that the ligand-binding domain
is absent and these ARs remain ligand independently constitutively active (6, 26). However, exclusive expression of AR
splice variants is very rare. The vast majority of cells expressing
AR splice variants also express wild-type AR (7). Therefore,
most tumors developing resistance through outlaw AR splice
variant expression should still exhibit responsiveness to androgens while maintaining active AR signaling in the absence of
androgens. It has been shown the wild-type AR can be activated
by growth factors, receptor tyrosine kinases, MAPK, AKT, and
other activators in a ligand-independent fashion (1). If no
ligands are available other than androgens in a cell with
promiscuous ARs, the cell then depends on androgens. If no
ligands are available in a cell with outlaw AR, AR signaling
remains active. Thus, this pathway is less dependent on
androgens than the promiscuous receptor pathway because
it is completely ligand independent.
The bypass pathway. This mechanism results from constitutive activation of pathways that directly inhibit apoptosis
in the absence of androgens (1). One mechanism may be the
upregulation of BCL2, BCLX, or MCL1, genes known to directly
inhibit apoptosis (1, 4, 10). Prostatic secretory epithelial cells
normally do not produce BCL2, but many CRPC cells do (1, 10).
However, besides prostatic sarcomas and neuroendocrine
carcinomas, which our model does not consider, the complete
bypass of AR signaling does not provide a selective advantage
(4, 6). This pathway is the least dependent on androgens for
survival.

Materials and Methods
Formulation of the mathematical model
We extend the prostate cancer IAD treatment model by
Portz and colleagues (19) who consider tumors as two cell
populations: cells that are castration sensitive (CS) and those
that are castration resistant (CR). The mathematical model
portrayed in the Quick Guide describes two populations of
luminal secretory epithelial cells that secrete PSA (1). The CR
population accounts for prostate cancer cells that have

www.aacrjournals.org

acquired at least one mechanism of treatment resistance. The
static parameter values, free parameter value ranges, and their
interpretations are listed in Table 1. Detailed model formulation and explanations can be found in (19) and are summarized
in the Quick Guide above. What follows is a narrative summary
of the equations and assumptions.
Here, we follow Portz and colleagues in assuming that
proliferation of prostate carcinoma cells is more-or-less androgen dependent, this dependence can vary among cells in a
given tumor, and cells can switch reversibly between CS and CR
states. Our major extension of the Portz and colleagues' model
is the addition of an androgen-dependent cell-death rate (CDR)
function, Di ðQi Þ (Equation C). We retain the Droop formalism
(27), adapted from chemostat and ecologic models, to govern
androgen-dependent proliferation, as well as the forms used
by Portz and colleagues for androgen-dependent switching
between CS and CR states—i.e., l1 and l2 (Equations A, B, D,
and E).
In this model, androgen enters cells in which it can bind to
and dissociate from ARs in the intracellular compartment.
Androgen may also be metabolized or transported out of the
system. The dynamics of these processes are governed by the
cell quota (Equation F). Bound ARs alter cell proliferation,
death and state-switching rates. In general, proliferation rates
increase and mortality rates decrease with increasing concentration of bound ARs. The total AR concentration, both bound
and unbound, is regulated in the cell quota equation such that
the proliferation terms in Equations A and B can never become
negative. In low androgen environments, state switching by
prostate cells is biased in favor of the CR state. This bias is
reversed in high androgen environments. Both cell strains
secrete PSA to the serum at the same basic rate. However,
strains may vary in how their PSA secretion rate depends on
bound AR (see equation G).
It is an open question whether castration resistance evolves
from selection acting on a small population of CR cells that
exist in the tumor before treatment (the selection hypothesis),
or whether CR strains arise during treatment (the adaptation
hypothesis), or both (28, 29, 30). The role accommodative
changes play is also not well understood. Here, by accommodative changes, we mean reversible changes in cell behavior
not associated with any genetic or genomic alterations—that
is, plasticity in the cells' behavioral repertoire available to
accommodate ﬂuctuations in their environment. The possibility of accommodative switching between relative CS and CR
states in a single clonal lineage was initially investigated in a
model by Hirata and colleagues (20, 21). Portz and colleagues
(19) assumed reversible switching between CS and CR states at
rates l1 and l2, which both depend on the bound AR cell quota
(see Equations A, B, D, and E). Although Portz and colleagues
interpreted these as forward and backward mutations between
CS and CR states, the form is much more general. Any
mechanism of castration resistance, including mutation in
coding and control regions of a variety of genes and epigenetic
changes, can be accommodated by the model's form. Regardless of which process the mathematics truly reﬂects, the
incorporation of this switch resulted in Portz and colleagues'
model ﬁtting data much more accurately than previous models

from which it was derived. However, we interpret the switch
as incorporating both adaptation and accommodation to
cover all possible switching mechanisms. The adaptation
label is supported by the fact that AR point mutations are
rarely found in primary prostate cancer but are found in
approximately 20% of CRPCs (11). Furthermore, one study
showed that only two of 205 untreated prostate cancer cases
had detectable AR ampliﬁcation (31), and another study
showed that 38% to 63% of metastatic CRPC cases exhibited
high-level AR ampliﬁcation (32, 33). This evidence strongly
suggests that an oscillating androgen environment creates
selective pressure inducing an adaptive switch. Although
this evidence only shows evolution toward CRPC, it is
possible that CR tumors could evolve back to CS if selective
pressures change (e.g., androgen is reintroduced); although
this return to castration sensitivity would be unlikely to be
due to direct back mutation, we recognize that the phenotype can be regenerated by novel alterations of coding or
control sequences to a variety of genes in a given resistance
pathway. It is necessary to include accommodation into the
interpretation because epigenetic modiﬁcations, which can
lead to phenotypic switching, take place at a much higher
rate than genetic modiﬁcations (34) and several epigenetic
aberrations play a role in prostate cancer that can facilitate
the phenotypic switch represented by l1 and l2 (35).
CDR analysis
The CDR analysis method we propose here consists of
analyzing the CDR levels and oscillations in response to
intermittent treatment to determine which molecular basis
is conferring treatment resistance in a given patient. The
rationale behind CDR analysis is as follows:
1. The mechanism of action of IAD is largely induction of
apoptosis, because all CS cells and most CR cells exhibit
some degree of dependence on androgens for survival.
2. Because the treatment is intermittent, CDRs increase
during on-treatment and decrease during off-treatment
giving rise to CDR oscillations.
3. The amplitude of CDR oscillation in a given population
reﬂects the degree to which that population depends on
androgens for survival.

4. Each mechanism of treatment resistance varies in its
dependence on androgens for survival.
5. In addition, CDR levels tell us whether or not there is a
constitutively active antiapoptotic pathway inherent in
the population (i.e., the bypass pathway). An exceedingly
low CDR indicates there is.
6. We identify which major mechanism of treatment
resistance is developing by analyzing the CDR levels and
oscillations.
Data
The data from Akakura and colleagues were obtained from
seven patients with progressive prostate cancer undergoing
IAD by total androgen blockade (9). Serum PSA and testosterone were assayed monthly to monitor therapy. Treatment
was initiated and subsequently interrupted after serum PSA
had been suppressed to adequately low levels for roughly six
months. When PSA recovered past 15 to 20 ng/mL, treatment
was reinitiated for a new cycle.
Treatment induced rapid decreases in serum testosterone,
with levels reaching approximately 0.5 to 1.0 nmol/L after
about one or two months. These low levels were sustained until
interruption of treatment, after which testosterone recovered
relatively quickly, with some variation depending on the
patient. The coupling of these changes to those of PSA varied
across not only patients but also cycles of individual patients.
Akakura and his colleagues suggested that these dynamics
were due both to changes in androgen sensitivity and to the
"dual effect" of androgen on PSA; namely, the cellular level (PSA
synthesis and secretion) and the population level (proliferation
and apoptosis; ref. 9). The model captures these effects via the
dependence of Q(t) (Equation F) on the serum androgen
concentration A(t). CDR analysis quantiﬁes this behavior
across cycles and patients in a way that is both simple and
biologically meaningful.
For each patient, CDR values were calculated by ﬁtting the
model to the PSA data. To implement the serum androgen
function, A(t), testosterone data were interpolated using the
same approach found in Portz and colleagues (19). The Nelder–
Mead simplex algorithm (36) was then used to minimize the
mean-square error (MSE) of the PSA data with the model
solution P(t) by varying the parameters mm, s 0, qi, s i, di, Ri, and

Simulations and diagnosis
To identify the major mechanism of resistance for each
patient, we establish criteria based on Fi, the total CDR
oscillation amplitude deﬁned in Equation H. Because the
amplitude of CDR oscillation reﬂects the degree to which a
population depends on androgens for survival, and because
each mechanism varies in its degree of dependence on androgens for survival, we propose that there exist threshold CDR
oscillation amplitudes that distinguish one mechanism from
another. Speciﬁcally, we deﬁne two threshold values, T0 and T1.
For 0 < Fi  T0 , the CDR is said to be relatively constant and
the population is, thus, relatively independent of androgens for
survival. For Fi ¼ 0, which occurs when di ¼ 0 or Ri ¼ 0
(Qai;max and Qai;min are never equal), the CDR is constant and the
population is completely independent of androgens for survival. For T0 < Fi  T1 , the CDR is said to slightly oscillate with
respect to oscillation in androgen concentration and the
population, thus, retains some dependence on androgens for
survival. For T1 < Fi , we say that there is relatively high oscillation in the CDR with respect to oscillation in androgen
concentration and the population is, thus, completely dependent on androgens for survival. We also deﬁne a threshold L
such that for maxfDi ðQi Þg < L, the CDR is said to be exceed-

ingly low. An exceedingly low CDR would be characteristic of a
constitutively active antiapoptotic pathway such that apoptosis is directly inhibited in the population, i.e., the bypass
pathway.
As a novel approach for computational molecular diagnosis,
our threshold values for T0 , T1 , and L are estimates based on
existing hypotheses and data relevant to this work. Model
parameters were constrained to biologically relevant ranges
when applicable. When estimating these values, we considered
consistency with patient-speciﬁc clinical observations and with
the relative frequency of each mechanism reported in the
literature. The threshold values were estimated to be
L ¼ 0:013 day1 , T0 ¼ 0:0003 day1 , and T1 ¼ 0:0013 day1 .
Mutations in the AR gene that confer hypersensitivity are the
most frequent mutations found in CRPC and there is strong
evidence that AR overexpression is the main mechanism of
CRPC development (15). Therefore, these threshold values
were estimated such that 4 of 7 patients would be diagnosed
with hypersensitivity. Thus, T1 was estimated to be slightly
below the CDR oscillation amplitude value of patient 7,
F2 ¼ 0:0014 day1 . Because patient 4 was the only patient
proposed to have early onset of CRPC and had an exceedingly low CDR relative to others, L was estimated to be
slightly above maxfD2 ðQ2 Þg ¼ 0:0110 day1 , the maximum CDR of patient 4. T0 was estimated to be slightly
above the CDR oscillation amplitude value of patient 2,

aggressive treatment resistance compared with others.
Although a given patient may develop CRPC due to a
combination of mechanisms, we assume that it is primarily
due to one major mechanism. If more than one mechanism is
inherent in the population, the one that is the least dependent
on androgens for survival is the major mechanism. Because
the hypersensitivity pathway maintains the strongest dependence on androgens, we propose that patients developing

resistance primarily through this pathway should exhibit a
high oscillation amplitude F2 with a maximum CDR that is not
exceedingly low; i.e., T1 < F2 and maxfD2 ðQ2 Þg  L. The
promiscuous receptor pathway, which is less dependent on
androgens than the hypersensitivity pathway, should exhibit a
smaller oscillation amplitude F2 while maintaining a maximum CDR that is not exceedingly low; i.e., T0 < F2  T1 and

NOTE: These diagnoses were carried out using criteria for predictive diagnosis by CDR analysis outlined in Table 2 on the basis of
F2 (the amplitude of CR CDR oscillation), maxfD2 ðQ2 Þg (the maximum CR CDR), and threshold values L ¼ 0:013 day1 ,
T0 ¼ 0:0003 day1 , and T1 ¼ 0:0013 day1 .

receptor pathway because it is completely ligand independent
and, therefore, exhibits an oscillation amplitude that is zero or
relatively constant and the maximum CDR should remain not
exceedingly low; i.e., 0  F2  T0 and maxfD2 ðQ2 Þg  L.
The bypass pathway exhibits an exceedingly low CDR and is
completely androgen independent for survival and, thus, oscillates minimally; i.e., 0  F2  T0 and maxfD2 ðQ2 Þg < L. We
propose no mechanism for exceedingly low and oscillating
CDRs as they are biologically unlikely to exist because the
apoptotic program would be directly shut down. These criteria
are outlined in Table 2.

Results and Discussion
For each patient, we computed the amplitudes of CDR
oscillation Fi given in Equation H and the maximum CDRs
for CDR analysis. We then diagnosed each patient using the
outlined criteria (see Table 2). Figure 1 shows the PSA, cell
quota, CDR, and proliferation-rate plots for patient 1. Figure 2
shows the PSA plots for patients 2 to 7. Figure 3 shows the CDR
plots for patients 2 to 7. The proliferation-rate and cell-quota
plots for patients 2 to 7 are found in the Supplementary
Material, as are the MSE values of the ﬁtted model solutions
and PSA data. Table 3 contains the predictive diagnosis for
each patient based on our criteria for CDR analysis. As
expected, none of the patients have cell populations with
exceedingly low and oscillating CDRs.
As expected, our results suggest that most CR populations
retain at least some degree of dependence on androgens for
survival. Patient 4 is the only patient whose PSA level never
dropped below 4 ng/mL within the ﬁrst 8 months of treatment (see Fig. 2). Akakura and colleagues (9) concluded that
IAD is likely ineffective for patients whose PSA levels do not
fall below this stable level within the ﬁrst 8 months of
treatment. They suggest that failure for PSA levels to normalize within this time period is a sign of early onset of
CRPC (9). Our results show that patient 4 is the only patient
that did not have a highly oscillating CS CDR, meaning that
the CS population for patient 4 was not fully dependent on
androgens for survival, consistent with the notion of early
onset of CRPC. Patients whose CS CDR oscillations are

www.aacrjournals.org

inside the range of T1, or F1 < T1 , may, thus, be developing
early onset of CRPC. Furthermore, patient 4 was diagnosed
with the most aggressive and least androgen-dependent
pathway according to our criteria, which is also consistent
with early onset of CRPC.
In future studies, it will be important to assess how much
data are required for CDR analysis. In this study, diagnoses
were based on the entire datasets from the clinical trial, which
varied from 1.5 to 3.5 cycles per patient. At this stage of its
development, we believe at least one full cycle of treatment is
needed. This includes data from start until shortly after the
second on-treatment has begun and PSA has regressed to
physiologic range. Ideally, physicians will continually test
patients' levels and update their diagnosis proﬁle with subsequent targeted treatment.
Although the threshold values L, T0, and T1 remain to be
validated clinically, even once these values are empirically
determined it is possible that they will still be subject to
variation among datasets, and among patients. As with most
models used for clinical prediction, it is likely to require
repeated updating and validation with new datasets (37).
Furthermore, we expect such updates not only to involve these
thresholds, but also to include modiﬁcations to the model
itself. We recognize this study as one that is preliminary but
that establishes the principles of CDR analysis—a novel
computational method for molecular diagnosis—on which
others may build.
Although we demonstrated how CDR analysis works using
CRPC development as an example, this methodology may be
applied to other types of cancer. In particular, other steroid
hormone–driven malignancies, such as estrogen receptor–
positive (ERþ) breast cancers, share many similarities in
terms of their progression. For example, certain ERþ breast
cancers can be treated intermittently with LHRH analogues
to suppress serum estrogen levels in combination with
antiestrogens that directly inhibit ER signaling (38, 39),
which is similar to the combination of LHRH analogues and
antiandrogens in the total androgen blockade used for
prostate cancer IAD.

of future cancer therapy. CDR analysis is a method for identifying the mechanism, which physicians can then conceivably
target, thus reestablishing treatment sensitivity in these
patients. Sequential identiﬁcation and targeting of resistance
mechanisms may potentially control or eradicate cancers.
