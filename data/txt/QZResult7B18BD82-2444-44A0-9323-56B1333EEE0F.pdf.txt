BACKGROUND: Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors frequently result in dermatologic toxicities,
including rash, xerosis, pruritus, and paronychia. Although the frequency and severity of these events have been
described, their effect on health-related quality of life (QoL) remains poorly understood. By using a dermatology-specific questionnaire, the authors examined the effect of these toxicities on QoL. METHODS: Patients completed the
Skindex-16, a questionnaire that measures the effects on 3 domains of QoL: symptoms, emotions, and functioning.
The severity of dermatologic toxicities was assessed using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 3.0 (NCI-CTCAE). Correlations of dermatology QoL scores with NCI-CTCAE grade,
skin phototype (SPT), sex, age, type of EGFR inhibitor, and cancer type were investigated. RESULTS: Concordant
with greater severity of rash grade, there was an increase in median scores for symptoms (P ¼ .0006), emotions (P <
.0001), function (P ¼ .001), and overall score (P < .0001). There was an inverse correlation between age and emotions
(r ¼ 0.26; P ¼ .03) and overall score (r ¼ 0.25; P ¼ .04). There was a significant difference between patients aged
50 years and patients aged >50 years with regard to symptoms (P ¼ .02), emotions (P ¼ .03), functioning (P ¼
.04), and overall score (P ¼ .02). There were no significant differences between QoL and SPT, sex, treatment type, or
cancer type (P > .05). CONCLUSIONS: Toxicities, including rash, xerosis, paronychia, and pruritus, adversely affected
QoL, and rash was associated with a QoL greater decrease. Younger patients reported lower overall QoL than older
patients who had the same toxicities. The current results support using the NCI-CTCAE as a correlative tool for measC 2010 American Cancer Society.

Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors (EGFRIs) have emerged as robust antineoplastic agents for
advanced solid tumors. These agents are preferred for what is considered a more favorable systemic side-effect profile compared with cytotoxic chemotherapy. Unlike chemotherapy, which affects most replicating cells, EGFRIs target select pathways that are essential for tumor growth and survival. However, in certain tissues, such as skin, hair, and nails, EGFR
signaling is essential for normal functioning. Consequently, it is well known that EGFRIs cause dermatologic toxicities,
including a papulopustular rash (PPR) in 45% to 100% of patients, xerosis in 7% to 35% of patients, pruritus in 8% to 35%
of patients, and paronychia in 12% to 16% of patients.1-3 Scalp alopecia, trichomegaly of the eyelashes, and increased hair
on the face, nares, and eyebrows also have been reported.4 It has been demonstrated that, if left untreated, these dermatologic
adverse events result in EFGRI dose modification in 72% of episodes or discontinuation in 30% of episodes.5 Therefore, it is
essential that clinicians adequately manage dermatologic toxicities related to EGFRIs to ensure compliance with regimens.3

Quality of Life in EGFRI Patients/Joshi et al

The physical and psychological effects of dermatologic toxicities secondary to EGFRIs can affect patients’
health-related quality of life (QoL). Interviews of patients
who received EGFRIs have revealed that the physical discomfort—specifically, pain, burning, and skin sensitivity—caused by EGFRI-induced dermatologic toxicities is
burdensome and may progress to significantly impact
patients’ health-related QoL by restricting daily activities
and independence.6 Patients also may experience worry,
frustration, depression, and withdrawal from social activities because of dermatologic toxicities.6 Whether patients
can adequately report this information directly as patientreported outcomes remains a focused area of investigation. The National Cancer Institute’s Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE) is a
standard tool used by clinicians to report toxic effects of
cancer treatment trials. It has been reported that patients
and physicians do not agree on the severity of symptom
grades for common CTCAE items.7 Thus, patient selfreporting of symptoms is a possible approach of symptom
monitoring in cancer treatment trials for optimal management.7 Effective treatment of dermatologic adverse effects
of EGFRIs may enhance QoL by limiting toxicities, promoting symptom relief, and/or shortening the duration of
disability.
An important gap in the literature on QoL and
EGFRIs is that the measurement of dermatology-related
QoL generally has not been quantified. Consequently,
nearly all of the literature on this topic is from anecdotal
reports from patient series or clinician observation. It is
possible to measure the impact of EGFRI toxicities with
existing QoL instruments, especially those that target dermatologic conditions. One such QoL instrument is the
Skindex-16, a self-reported, dermatology-specific QoL
questionnaire that has undergone reliability and validity
testing in skin disorders, including acne and psoriasis.8
Although the Skindex-16 has not been used previously in
relation to EGFRIs, its advantages include item content
focused on multiple dimensions of patient experiences living with acute and chronic skin disorders and its ease of
administration. More generally, patients in oncology
practices are receptive to completing health-related QoL
questionnaires, making administration of the Skindex-16,
or similar QoL measures feasible.9
The objectives of the current study were to establish
the effect of EGFRI-induced dermatologic toxicities on
QoL and to determine whether patient characteristics are
correlated with dermatology-related QoL. If certain demographic features are associated with decreased QoL,

Cancer

then earlier interventions may be implemented to target
vulnerable groups. Because the Skindex-16 is reported in
3 domains—symptoms, emotions, and functioning—we
also examined which QoL domain was affected most by
dermatologic toxicities resulting from EGFRIs. This information may allow for specialized care, whether it is
directed medically, psychologically, or socially. In this
study, we also investigated the correspondence of physician-assigned NCI-CTCAE grades for EGFRI-induced
cutaneous reactions with patient-reported, dermatologyspecific QoL, because correspondence between the 2 may
suggest the use of the NCI-CTCAE as a surrogate tool to
measure the effects of EGFRIs on dermatology-specific
QoL. Our findings are intended to demonstrate the effect
of dermatologic toxicities on QoL in EGFRI-treated
patients.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Data Collection
Data were collected through a Northwestern University
Institutional Review Board-approved, retrospective medical record review of patients who were seen between July
2007 and April 2008 at Northwestern University’s Skin
and Eye Reactions to Inhibitors of EGFR and Kinases
(SERIES) clinic, a specialty referral clinic for patients who
have dermatologic toxicities from cancer therapies.10
Informed consent was waived for the purposes of this retrospective review. Patient data were included in the
research dataset if they presented to the clinic with an
EGFRI as part of their therapeutic regimen. Patients who
were referred for prophylactic treatment of dermatologic
toxicity were coded as grade 0. Patients who completed
the Skindex-16 at their initial visit were included in the
study. For each patient, the following information was
collected from the medical record, as available: sex; age;
type of EGFRI (cetuximab, erlotinib, lapatinib, panitumumab, or gefitinib); Fitzpatrick skin phototype (SPT);
severity of rash, as measured by NCI-CTCAE; pruritus
grade; xerosis grade; paronychia grade; alopecia grade;
telangiectasia grade; and mucositis grade.
Grading of Dermatologic Adverse Events
Clinical severity grading of dermatologic adverse events
was assessed using the version 3.0 of the NCI-CTCAE.
Severity of EGFRI-induced PPR was classified according
to the NCI-CTCAE acne/acneiform rash grades. Grade 0
refers to no rash. According to the NCI-CTCAE, a grade
1 rash does not require intervention. Intervention is

Each item asks the patient the degree to which they have been bothered by a specific aspect of their skin condition in the week before administration of the
instrument. The patient answers each question by indicating a number from 0 (never bothered) to 5 (always bothered).

indicated in a grade 2 rash; and grade 3 rash is associated
with pain, disfigurement, ulceration, or desquamation.
Both xerosis and cheilitis are categorized as follows:
grade 1, asymptomatic; grade 2, symptomatic but does
not interfere with activities of daily living; and grade 3,
interferes with activities of daily living. Pruritus is classified grade 1 (mild or localized), grade 2 (intense or widespread), and grade 3 (intense or widespread and interferes
with activities of daily living). Telangiectasia is categorized
using the following scale: grade 1, few; grade 2, moderate
number; and grade 3, many and confluent. Alopecia is
classified as grade 1 (thinning or patchy) or grade 2 (complete). Both mucositis and paronychia are classified as
grade 1 (mild), grade 2 (moderate), grade 3 (severe), and
grade 4 (life-threatening, disabling).
Assessment of QoL Using the Skindex-16
The Skindex-16 is a 16-item, single-spaced, skin-related,
QoL instrument that has been validated as an accurate
and sensitive measure of how much patients are bothered
by their skin conditions.8 The Skindex-16 instrument is
displayed in Table 1. Each item asks patients the degree to
which they have been bothered by a specific aspect of their
skin condition in the week before administration of the
instrument. Patients answer every question with a number
ranging from 0 (never bothered) to 6 (always bothered).
After the questionnaire is completed, the responses to
each item are transformed to a linear scale of 100 that
ranges from 0 (never bothered) to 100 (always bothered).
Consequently, each item has a minimum score of 0 and a

3918

maximum score of 100. In the current study, the Skindex16 results are reported as an overall score and as 3 domain
scores: symptoms, emotions, and functioning. For the
overall score, the mean score of all items is calculated.
Thus, the overall score has a minimum of 0 and a maximum of 100. Items 1 through 4 on the Skindex-16 pertain to the symptoms domain. The mean of these items is
calculated, and a symptoms domain score is determined
that also ranges from 0 to 100. Similarly, the emotions domain is based on items 5 through 11, and an emotions domain score is calculated on a scale from 0 to 100. The
functioning domain is based on items 12 through 16, and
a functioning domain score is calculated in the same manner. Skindex-16 items also are analyzed within each domain to assess the influence of specific items on the overall
domain score. The means of the transformed scores for
each item are compared statistically within each domain.
Determination of Fitzpatrick SPT
The Fitzpatrick SPT is a classification system for skin
phototype that is used widely in dermatology to characterize an individual’s susceptibility to sunlight.11 Sunburn
often is observed in patients who have a limited ability to
develop inducible melanin pigmentation (tanning) in
response to ultraviolet radiation. Darker skinned individuals burn less often and tan with greater ease than lighter
skinned individuals. There are 6 phototypes that range
from I to VI. Individuals with SPT I have pale, white skin
and, in response to sun exposure, burn easily and do not
tan; individuals with SPT II have white skin, tan with

Cancer

difficulty, and burn easily; individuals with SPT III have
white skin and tan after an initial sunburn; individuals
with SPT IV have light-brown or olive skin and tan easily
with sun exposure; individuals with SPT V have brown
skin and also tan easily; and individuals with SPT VI have
black skin and become darker in the sun.11
Statistical Analysis
Skindex-16 scores are reported as medians and semi-interquartile ranges (SIQR) (half the distance between the
25th and 75th percentiles). Repeated-measures analyses
of variance were used to compare across the 3 Skindex-16
domain scales (emotions, symptoms, and functioning)
and overall scores within the same individuals, and posthoc t tests (Bonferroni adjusted for 3 tests) were used for
pairwise comparisons. Repeated-measures analyses of variance also were used to compare across the individual
items within each domain scale, and post-hoc t tests were
used for pairwise comparisons. Spearman correlation
coefficients were used to relate the domain and total Skindex-16 scores with age. Wilcoxon rank-sum tests were
used to relate the Skindex-16 domain scores and total
scores to sex, age (classified as aged 50 years vs >50),
and cancer type. The Kruskal-Wallis test was used
to relate the Skindex-16 domain and total scores to
NCI-CTCAE toxicity grade (0-3), SPT (I-VI), and type
of EGFRI.

RESULTS
Patient Demographics
Sixty-seven patients were included in this study. The
mean patient age was 59.1 years (range, 27-86 years), and
79% of patients were aged >50 years. The patients
included 61.2% women and 38.8% men. EGFR exposure
was as follows: Erlotinib was the most common (received
by 49.3% of patients), followed by cetuximab (received
by 38.8% of patients), then lapatinib (received by 7.5%
of patients), then panitumumab (received by 3% of
patients), and then gefitinib (received by 1.5% of
patients). The distribution of patients according to Fitzpatrick SPT was as follows: 19.4% of patients had SPT I,
25.4% of patients had SPT II, 13.4% of patients had SPT
III, 9% of patients had SPT IV, 7.5% of patients had SPT
V, and no patients had SPT VI. SPT was not collected for
25.4% of patients, because it was not documented in the
medical record at the time of the patient clinic visit.
Patient demographics are summarized in Table 2.

Dermatologic Toxicities
Most patients (82.1%) experienced a PPR; 26.9% of all
patients had grade 1 PPR, 47.8% of patients had grade 2
PPR, and 7.5% of patients had grade 3 PPR. A minority
of patients (17.9%) did not experience PPR. Of all 67
patients, 26.9% experienced grade 1 pruritus, 13.4%
experienced grade 2 pruritus, and the remaining patients
(56.7%) did not experience pruritus. Most patients
(59.7%) did not sustain xerosis; however, 19.4% of
patients had grade 1 xerosis, and 20.9% had grade 2 xerosis. Less than 9% of patients experienced each of the following EGFRI-related reactions: paronychia, alopecia,
telangiectasia, mucositis, and cheilitis. Dermatologic toxicities are summarized in Table 2.
Skindex-16 Scores
The study population had a median overall Skindex-16
score of 41.7 (SIQR, 25.0). The highest scores were for
the emotions domain (median score, 57.1; SIQR, 32.1),
which was significantly higher than the functioning domain (median score, 23.3; SIQR, 26.6; P < .0001) but
not different from the symptoms domain (median score,
45.8; SIQR, 29.1; P ¼ .11).
There were significantly negative Spearman correlations between age and emotions (r ¼ 0.26; P ¼ .03) and
between age and overall score (r ¼ 0.25; P ¼ .04). There
were negative but statistically nonsignificant Spearman
correlations between age and symptoms (P ¼ .10) and
between age and function (P ¼ .07). There was a statistically significant difference between patients aged 50
years and patients aged >50 years with regard to symptoms (P ¼ .02), emotions (P ¼ .03), function (P ¼ .04),
and overall score (P ¼ .02), and younger patients had
higher scores.
There was no statistically significant difference
between men and women with regard to symptoms (P ¼
.75), emotions (P ¼ .74), function (P ¼ .92), or overall
score (P ¼ .79). There was no statistically significant difference between treatment type (erlotinib vs lapatinib vs
gefitinib vs cetuximab/panitumumab combined) with
regard to symptoms (P ¼ .44), emotions (P ¼ .44), function (P ¼ .82), or overall score (P ¼ .62). Cetuximab and
panitumumab were analyzed together as monoclonal antibodies with similar toxicity profiles.
There was no statistically significant difference
between cancer type (lung vs colorectal vs all other cancer
types combined) with regard to symptoms (P ¼ .82),
emotions (P ¼ .46), function (P ¼ .52), or overall score
(P ¼ .56). There was no statistically significant difference

Correlation Between Skindex-16 Scores and
NCI-CTCAE Grading of Adverse Events
All Skindex-16 domain scores and overall scores differed
significantly among PPR grades 0 through 3 (Table 4),
such that median symptoms scores, emotion scores, and
functioning scores increased with increasing grade of
PPR. These differences were statistically significant for all
domains (symptoms domain, P ¼ .0006; emotions domain, P < .0001; functioning domain, P ¼ .0001).
The median Skindex-16 symptoms domain scores
for pruritus were as follows: grade 0 pruritus, 25.0; grade
1 pruritus, 41.7; and grade 2 pruritus, 66.7. The latter difference in symptoms domain scores among pruritus
grades approached significance (P ¼ .055). The median
Skindex-16 emotions domain scores for pruritus were as
follows: grade 0 pruritus, 31.0; grade 1 pruritus, 57.1; and
grade 2 pruritus, 73.8 (P ¼ .051). There was no statistically significant difference between pruritus grades for

functioning score (P ¼ .22) or for the overall Skindex-16
score (P ¼ .08).
The median symptoms domain scores were as follows: grade 0 xerosis, 45.8; grade 1 xerosis, 16.7; and
grade 2 xerosis, 58.3. The difference between all xerosis

grades with regard to symptoms was significant (P ¼ .03).
There was no statistically significant difference between
xerosis grades for emotions (P ¼ .16), functioning (P ¼
.27), or overall score (P ¼ .11). Because of the small numbers of patients who had paronychia, alopecia, telangiectasia, mucositis, and cheilitis, a statistical analysis of the
correlation of each of these adverse effects with the Skindex-16 score could not be performed.

DISCUSSION
The objective of this research was to determine whether
individual patient characteristics are correlated with dermatology-related QoL and the extent to which toxicity
grade is associated with worsening QoL when a multidimensional measure is used. The results from this study
demonstrate that younger patients have lower overall dermatology-related QoL than older patients who experience
similar toxicities. It is noteworthy that emotions domain
scores were significantly worse in younger patients despite
similar scores for the symptoms and functioning domains.
PPR typically is present on areas of the skin that are visible
to others, often the face, chest, and back,12 and it is possible that younger patients experience greater impediment
by the highly visible rash during treatment. When age was
dichotomized within our data into groups ages <50 years
and 50 years, the younger patients had significantly
higher scores in all domains, consistent with published
research indicating that QoL is effected more severely
among younger cancer patients.13-16 This underscores the
notion that younger patients may be more susceptible

than older patients to diminished QoL because of dermatologic toxicities from EGFRIs, which may be compounded by the finding reported by Jatoi et al that
younger patients also are more susceptible to severe
PPR.17
Results from the current study indicate that none of
the patient characteristics studied, including SPT, sex,
type of EGFRI, and tumor-type, were correlated significantly with dermatology-related QoL in patients with dermatologic toxicities. We also observed that emotions were
impacted most detrimentally by EGFRI-induced dermatologic toxicities. It is noteworthy that this finding varies
from the results of a previously reported, uncontrolled
study suggesting that physical discomfort from EGFRIinduced toxicities had the greatest impact on QoL.6 It
appears that the disease-targeted instrument, the Skindex16, is more sensitive, because it includes mild levels of psychological stress from EGFR toxicities by including terms
like worry and frustration, compared with generic measures like the 36-item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36).
However, the range of physical limitations in the Skindex16 is more limited compared with that in generic
measures.
Further analysis of Skindex-16 items within each
domain indicates that, with regard to symptoms, patients
are more concerned about irritation than about burning
or stinging. With regard to the emotions domain, patients
reported that the persistence or recurrence of the skin condition was significantly more important than feeling
depressed about the skin condition. This may result from
patients being confused by, or unsure of, the relation
between the skin condition and the progress of cancer
treatment. Finally, within the functioning domain, QoL
is impacted most by the effects of the skin condition on
daily activities. This finding may be understood through
anecdotal patient frustrations, indicating that the toxicities resulting from EGFRIs are a public reminder of their
cancer status. Thus, it is important to not discount the
impact of these toxicities on the daily life of such patients
and the possible concern that the toxicities are related to
the status of their cancer. Data collected herein are consistent with case reports indicating that EGFRI-induced
PPR has a significantly negative impact on QoL as measured by the Skindex-16. PPR has significant, deleterious
effects on physical skin symptoms, emotional well being,
and functioning in activities of daily living.
Although the Skindex-16 score provides a quantitative assessment of QoL, it may be difficult for clinicians to
extrapolate the importance of a numerical value without a

frame of reference. To elucidate this, Skindex-16 scores
from patients who experienced PPR were compared with
published Skindex-16 reports of patients with eczematous
dermatitis and acne vulgaris.8 The median Skindex-16
symptoms domain score was 58.3 for both grade 2 and
grade 3 PPR. In comparison, the mean symptoms domain
scores for eczematous dermatitis and acne vulgaris were
42 and 31, respectively. The median emotions domain
scores for grade 2 and 3 PPR were 61.9 and 81.0, respectively; and the mean emotions domain scores for eczematous dermatitis and acne vulgaris were 52 and 75,
respectively. The median functioning domain scores for
grade 2 and 3 PPR were 28.3 and 50.0, respectively; and
the mean functioning domain scores for eczematous dermatitis and acne vulgaris were 24 and 38, respectively.
Taken as a whole, EGFRI-induced grade 2 and 3 PPR has
marked effects on symptoms, emotions, and functioning
that are greater than the effects of acne vulgaris and more
prominent than those of eczematous dermatitis.
The limitations of this study include the inability to
thoroughly discern the impact of individual toxicities on
QoL. It is noteworthy that, as a skin-related questionnaire, the Skindex-16 does not specifically address hair,
nails, or mucous membranes, which are additional significant targets for EGFRI-induced toxicity. Thus, the Skindex-16 is not likely to adequately reflect alterations in
QoL because of toxicities like alopecia, paronychia, and
mucositis. Moreover, in the current dataset, we lack the
ability to understand the complexity of patient responses
to the questionnaire. In short, patients may be responding
to a constellation of toxicities as opposed to a focused skin
toxicity like PPR, which is aligned most closely with the
aims of the Skindex-16 as a cutaneous assessment tool.
The higher median symptoms domain scores for grade 0
xerosis (45.8) compared with grade 1 xerosis (16.7) may
be attributable to the coexistence of other toxicities that
affect QoL, such as rash and hair and nail abnormalities,
which are present in 100% of patients on long-term therapy.18 In addition, although the Skindex-16 values indicated a trend toward a correlation with pruritus grade, the
results did not attain statistical significance. Particularly
notable was the lack of a correlation between the functioning domain and the severity of toxicity.
Because of these limitations, it would be valuable to
develop a QoL measurement tool that is sensitive to the
multilayered toxicity profile experienced by patients who
receive EGFRI therapy. The development of a validated
QoL measure that analyzes each toxicity as an individual
entity likely will lead to a more in-depth understanding of

the impact on QoL for all types of skin appendages and
dermatology-related toxicities.
The results from this study underscore the need to
develop effective treatments for EGFRI-induced dermatologic toxicities so that we can improve QoL and ensure
medication adherence. This study also highlights the need
for increased awareness of QoL related to these adverse
reactions in the dermatologic-oncologic community. In
addition, the findings support using the NCI-CTCAE as
a correlative tool to measure the effects of PPR on dermatology-specific QoL.
