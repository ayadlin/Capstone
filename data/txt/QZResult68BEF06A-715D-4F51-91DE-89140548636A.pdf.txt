ABSTRACT
Runt-related transcription factor 3 (RUNX3) methylation plays an important role
in the carcinogenesis of breast cancer (BC). However, the association between RUNX3
hypermethylation and significance of BC remains under investigation. The purpose
of this study is to perform a meta-analysis and literature review to evaluate the
clinicopathological significance of RUNX3 hypermethylation in BC. A comprehensive
literature search was performed in Medline, Web of Science, EMBASE, Cochrane
Library Database, CNKI and Google scholar. A total of 10 studies and 747 patients
were included for the meta-analysis. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) with corresponding
confidence intervals (CIs) were evaluated and summarized respectively. RUNX3
hypermethylation was significantly correlated with the risk of ductal carcinoma in situ
(DCIS) and invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC), OR was 50.37, p < 0.00001 and 22.66,
p < 0.00001 respectively. Interestingly, the frequency of RUNX3 hypermethylation
increased in estrogen receptor (ER) positive BC, OR was 12.12, p = 0.005. High RUNX3
mRNA expression was strongly associated with better relapse-free survival (RFS) in
BC patients. In summary, RUNX3 methylation could be a promising early biomarker
for the diagnosis of BC. High RUNX3 mRNA expression is correlated to better RFS in
BC patients. RUNX3 could be a potential therapeutic target for the development of
personalized therapy.

INTRODUCTION

genes including RUNX1, RUNX2 and RUNX3, encode
transcription factors which bind DNA by partnering with
the cofactor, CBFβ/PEBP2β (core-binding factor-beta
subunit/polyomavirus enhancer-binding protein 2 beta
subunit). The complex regulates the growth, survival and
differentiation via a few essential transcription factors
[4]. RUNX3 plays an important role in gastric epithelial
growth [5], development of dorsal root ganglia [6-7] and
T-cell differentiation [8], and has a principle role in the
regulation of cell proliferation, cell death, angiogenesis,
as well as invasion [9-10]. RUNX3 was first reported
as a tumor suppressor in gastric cancer because of the
causal link between the loss of RUNX3 and gastric
carcinogenesis [5]. Since then, RUNX3 has been
observed as a suppressor that is inactivated in a variety
of pre-invasive and invasive tumor including BC [11].
RUNX3 protein regulates the growth-suppressive effects

Breast cancer (BC) is the most frequently diagnosed
cancer and the leading cancer related death for women
worldwide, with 232,340 new cases every year [1].
Carcinogenesis in breast is a linear multi-step process
which starts as flat epithelial atypia (FEA), progresses
to atypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH), advances to ductal
carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and invasive ductal carcinoma
(IDC). The most common cause of death in BC is invasive
malignancy. Therefore, it is critical to identify an early
detection biomarker to predict the progression of BC [2].
The studies of molecular mechanism have
demonstrated that the carcinogenesis involves the
accumulation of various genetic alterations including loss
of tumor suppressor genes and amplification of oncogenes
[3]. RUNX (Runt-related transcription factor) family of

of transforming growth factor-β (TGF- β) by associating
with SMAD, a downstream protein in the signaling
pathway [12]. Recently, RUNX3 has been reported to
attenuate Wnt signaling by directly suppressing β-catenin/
TCF4 in colon cancer and gastric cancer [13]. Previous
evidences in cell lines, knockout animals, and primary
human cancer tissues have indicated that RUNX3 as a
suppressor is inactivated in BC by reduced copy number
[14], protein mislocalization [10, 15], hemizygous deletion
and promoter hypermethylation [16-18]. However, the role
of RUNX3 as a tumor suppressor in the progression and
prognosis of BC remains unclear due to the small sample
size of individual studies. We conducted a meta-analysis
which increases the sample size and thus the power, to
investigate the significance of RUNX3 hypermethylation
in the progression and prognosis of BC.

The frequency of RUNX3 methylation was
significantly higher in DCIS than in normal breast tissues
and the pooled OR was 50.37 with 95% CI 12.32-205.90, z
= 5.46, p < 0.00001, I2 = 0%, p = 0.76 (Figure 2). RUNX3
promoter in IDC patients was significantly methylated
than in normal breast, OR was 22.66 with 95% CI 12.4841.17, z = 10.25, p < 0.00001, I2 = 0%, p = 0.43 (Figure
3). In addition, RUNX3 methylation was significantly
increased in IDC than in benign tumor, OR was 55.65 with
95% CI 9.99-310.15, z = 4.59, p < 0.00001, I2 = 0%, p =
0.73 (Figure 4). RUNX3 methylation was not significantly
increased in IDC than DCIS, OR was 1.06 with 95% CI
0.56-2.01, z = 0.18, p = 0.86, I2 = 0%, p = 0.94 (Figure 5).
RUNX3 methylation was strongly correlated to RUNX3
loss, OR was 0.12 with 95% CI 0.04-0.30, z = 4.41, p <
0.0001, I2 = 47% (Figure 6). In addition, the frequency of
RUNX3 methylation was higher in ER positive patients
with BC than in ER negative patients with BC (Figure 7).
The OR was 12.12 with 95% CI 2.14-68.68, z = 2.82, p =
0.005, I2 = 9%, p = 0.29. High RUNX3 mRNA expression
was strongly correlated to better relapse-free survival
(RFS) in all 3554 BC patients (Figure 8).
The quality of each study was evaluated using the
Newcastle Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale (NOQAS).
Non-randomized case controlled studies and cohort

DISCUSSION

studies was assigned up to nine points in three domains, 1)
selection of study groups, 2) comparability, 3) exposure,
and outcomes for study participants. Among studies, five
graded 8 points and five graded 7 points. Those studies
were of a relatively high quality (Table 2). A sensitivity
analysis, in which one study was omitted at a time, was
performed to assess the result stability. The pooled ORs
were not affected, indicating the stability of present
analyses. The symmetry of funnel charts (Figure 9)
suggested that there were no publication biases in the
meta-analysis of RUNX3 methylation in BC.

Several studies have reported the contribution
of RUNX3 hypermethylation in BC progression by
utilizing small group of patients. To overcome small
sizes of individual studies, we conducted the powerful
meta-analysis with a total of ten studies and 747 patients,
and evaluated the role of RUNX3 hypermethylation in
the carcinogenic progression of BC. The pooled OR of
RUNX3 methylation in DCIS and NB or benign tumor
under the fixed-effects model was 50.37 which indicated

the frequency of RUNX3 hypermethylation in DCIS
significantly increased compare to NB or benign tumor,
the heterogeneity did not show significant difference
among studies at Cochran’s test, with low I2 index (0%),
suggesting RUNX3 methylation is an early event during
carcinogenesis which is consistent with the results of
the original articles included in present study. Similarly,
the hypermethylation rate of RUNX3 in IDC was also
significantly higher than in NB or benign tumor. Our
results are consistent with previous studies [19]. The

RUNX3 gene resides on human chromosome 1p36, a
region that genomic deletion frequently happened in
various human cancers, including BC [20]. The RUNX3
transcription factor is a downstream effector of TGF-β
signaling pathway. TGF-β is activated after binding
to Smad 4 (co-Smad) and enter the nucleus. RUNX3
binds R-Smads, co-Smads and p300, a transcriptional
co-activator, and fulfills its tumor suppressor activity
via TGF-β signaling pathway [12]. Xie et al has
observed the downstream SMAD pathway stays active

in majority of BC cells [21]. The sensitivity to TGF- β
was re-established in RUNX3-deficient cancer cells after
reintroducing RUNX3 into those cells which showed
increased expression of proapoptotic gene BIM [22]. In
addition, the status of EGFR, p53 or KRAS in RUNX3
hypermethylation in BC was unavailable, weather
RUNX3 silencing contributes to the development of BC
concomitantly or independently, further investigations are
needed. Previous evidences indicate RUNX family genes
regulate cell fate through p53-dependent DNA damage
response and/or tumorigenesis [23-24]. Additionally,
Omar et al reported that aberrant expression of RUNX3
was not biased toward the EGFR or KRAS mutation
pathway in lung adenocarcinoma (ADC), indicating that
RUNX3 methylation contributes the development of ADC
in an independent of EGFR or KRAS pathway [25].
Recent evidences indicate that RUNX3
hypermethylation attributes to the development of BC
through Wnt signaling pathway. Wnt signaling pathway
is not only critical for the development of the mammary
gland, but also is important for regulating cell proliferation
and survival. RUNX3 interacts with β-catenin/TCFs and
forms a complex which inhibits the transactivation via
blocking β-catenin/TCFs DNA binding [26]. Ito et al has
observed that RUNX3 down-regulates Wnt signaling by
directly inhibiting β-catenin/TCFs in colon cancer and
gastric cancer [13]. The activation of the Wnt/β-catenin
pathway was observed following knockdown of the
tumor suppressor gene phosphatase and tensin homolog
(PTEN) in human breast cells [27]. Furthermore, the
downregulation of the Wnt inhibitor Secreted FrizzledRelated Protein1 (Sfrp1) was observed in most invasive
human BC [28]. Taken together, RUNX3 as a suppressor
plays critical role in the development and progression of

BC via Wnt signaling pathway [29-30]. Therefore, high
RUNX3 mRNA expression is associated with better
relapse-free survival (RFS) in BC patients (Figure 8).
Kang et al reported 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine (5-AzaCdR), a demethylation agent restored the expression of
RUNX3, induced apoptosis and inhibited cell proliferation
in the breast cancer MCF-7 cell line. [31] In addition,
miR-29 family members (which downregulated the DNA
methyltransferases DNMT3A and DNMT3B in non-small
cell lung cancer [32]) could decrease promoter methylation
and increase expression of RUNX3, as a result, those
agents potentially suppress tumor proliferation and
induced apoptosis. Although more investigation needs
to complete, RUNX3 could be a potential therapeutic
target for the development of personalized treatment via
demethylation.
In addition, we found that RUNX3 promoter
methylation was not significantly increased in DCIS
compared to IDC. This data indicated that RUNX3
hypermethylation may not be required during the
progression from DCIS to IDC. Although there was not
heterogeneity existed between included studies, further
studies with higher power are needed to confirm this point.
RUNX3 methylation could also be detected in the sera of
patient with BC [33]. More extended studies are needed to
investigate the potential value of RUNX3 as a diagnostic
marker for BC in future.
We pooled four studies and evaluated the association
between RUNX3 methylation and RUNX3 loss, the result
showed that OR was 0.12, p < 0.0001, I2 = 47%. There
was moderate evidence for heterogeneity across studies
(I2 = 47%, p = 0.13), mostly accounted for by Lau et al
which reported lower rate of RUNX3 methylation (52%)
compared to other three studies (the rate of RUNX3

methylation arranged from 76% to 86%). Removal this
study from meta-analysis reduced the I2 statistic to 0%,
OR was changed to 0.32 with 95% CI 0.10-1.03, p = 0.06,
close to significantly different. Our finding indicated that
RUNX3 methylation was correlated with RUNX3 loss, but
more studies with a large population need to be completed.
Two studies have shown RUNX3 methylation was
higher in ER positive BC patients than in ER negative
BC patients. ER signaling plays an important role in the
development of mammary gland through the regulation
of cell proliferation and apoptosis [34]. Abnormal ER
signaling contributes to initiation and progression of
BC [35]. Recent evidence showed that RUNX3 inhibits
ER signaling through suppressing the transcription
activity of ERα and reducing ERα-dependent cancer cell
proliferation. Therefore, RUNX3 mRNA high expression
was correlated to better overall survival in ER-negative
patients, but not in ER-positive patients [19]. Aberrant
RUNX3 expression contribute to the development and
progression of BC through modulating ER signaling
pathway. Overexpression of RUNX3 in BC cells decreases
ERα expression, whereas deletion of RUNX3 by siRNA
increases ER expression. Expression of RUNX3 is
inversely associated with ERα in breast cells lines and
human BC tissue [36]. Further investigation with a
large population needs to be carried out to confirm this
mechanism.
There are some limitations in this meta-analysis.
Present results were based on individual unadjusted
ORs, while further investigation should be adjusted by
other potential risk factors. In addition, most selected
studies are from Asia population, thus, the findings of this
meta-analysis should be interpreted with caution. All the
included studies are observational studies which are well
known selection bias and publication bias, as positive
results may be more likely to be published than negative
results. We only selected relevant studies in English and
Chinese, some eligible studies in other languages may be
excluded, indicating language bias probably introduced.
In summary, the results of present meta-analysis
suggest that the frequency of RUNX3 hypermethylation
significantly increased in DCIS and IDC. RUNX3
methylation could be a promising biomarker for early
diagnosis of BC. High RUNX3 mRNA expression is
correlated to better relapse-free survival (RFS) in all BC
patients.

Cochrane Library Database (1972-2016), CNKI and
Google scholar. The following key words were used:
“RUNX3 methylation” and “breast cancer”. There were
35 studies identified from PubMed, 56 studies from Web
Science, 39 studies from Embase, 432 studies from CNKI.
First 300 of 2700 articles were screened from google
scholar.
The following were criteria for the inclusion:
1) The studies about RUNX3 methylation and the
clinicopathological significance in BC; 2) RUNX3
methylation in prognosis of patients with BC. 21 relevant
studies were included for full text review. Among of them,
11 studies were excluded for evaluating RUNX3 protein
expression, or using the same population, conference
abstracts containing insufficient data, and using cell lines.
The variables from 10 related studies were listed in Table
1.

Data extraction and study assessment
Two authors (DL and YM) performed independent
systematic reviews and collected data by using a
standardized data extraction form including the following
variables: first author’s name, year of publication,
countries, number of patients, study population, ER status,
stage of BC, grade of BC, and RUNX3 methylation rate,
RUNX3 expression. Any discrepancies were discussed
and reached a consensus for all issues.

Statistics analysis
Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals
were calculated by using a fixed or random effect model.
Heterogeneity among studies was evaluated by using the
Cochran Chi-square test and qualified by I2 statistics.
When the heterogeneity I2 < 50%, a fixed effect model
was used, otherwise. When I2 >50%, indicated substantial
heterogeneity among studies, a random effect model was
adopted. Potential sources of heterogeneity were then
investigated using subgroup analysis and meta-regression.
The analysis was conducted to compare RUNX3
methylation between DCIS and normal tissue, IDC and
normal tissue, IDC and DCIS, RUNX3 methylation in
ER positive and native patients. Two-sided statistical
tests and p-value were used. Relapse-free survival was
analyzed by using an online database Kaplan Meier-plotter
(cancer survival analysis) (http://kmplot.com/analysis/
index.php?p=service&cancer=breast). The database was
established by using gene expression and the survival
information of 3554 BC patients [37]. Publication bias
were evaluated by the funnel graphs. An asymmetric
funnel plot in meta-analysis suggests the existence of
publication bias. All analysis was conducted with Review
Manager 5.2.
