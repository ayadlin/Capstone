Abstract

Author Manuscript

The tumor suppressor serine/threonine kinase 11 (STK11 or LKB1) is mutated in 20–30% of nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patient tumors. Loss of LKB1-AMPK signaling confers
sensitivity to metabolic inhibition or stress-induced mitochondrial insults. We tested the
hypothesis that loss of LKB1 sensitizes NSCLC cells to energetic stress induced by treatment with
erlotinib. LKB1-deficient cells exhibited enhanced sensitivity to erlotinib in vitro and in vivo that
was associated with alterations in energy metabolism and mitochondrial dysfunction. Loss of
LKB1 expression altered the cellular response to erlotinib treatment, resulting in impaired ATP
homeostasis and an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS). Furthermore, erlotinib selectively
blocked mTOR signaling, inhibited cell growth, and activated apoptosis in LKB1-deficient cells.
Erlotinib treatment also induced AMPK activation despite loss of LKB1 expression, which was
partially reduced by the application of a CaMKKβ inhibitor (STO-609) or calcium chelator
(BAPTA-AM). These findings may have significant implications for the design of novel NSCLC
treatments that target dysregulated metabolic and signaling pathways in LKB1-deficient tumors.

INTRODUCTION
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide and is linked to 28% of all
1
cancer deaths in the United States . Despite advances in traditional therapeutic strategies
involving surgery, ionizing radiation therapy, and chemotherapy, the 5-year survival remains
2
less than 20% . In recent years, it has become clear that non-small cell lung cancer has a
high frequency of somatically acquired genetic alterations that define critical subsets of
3
tumors with distinct behaviors . An improved understanding of potential vulnerabilities of
lung cancer subsets has led to the development of effective targeted therapies for tumors
4 5
with certain activated oncogenes , , but little is known about specific susceptibilities that
may derive from the loss of classical tumor suppressor genes, such as LKB1.

Author Manuscript

LKB1 is a tumor suppressive serine/threonine kinase that activates diverse downstream
kinases, thus regulating a variety of cellular phenotypes including metabolism, invasion,
6
proliferation, and polarity . LKB1 inactivation occurs in 20–30 percent of lung
7
adenocarcinomas , and LKB1 deficiency in combination with KRAS mutation leads to an
aggressive tumor phenotype at high prevalence in mouse models, surpassing that of KRAS
8
mutation alone . Many of the metabolic regulatory functions of LKB1 are mediated by its
interaction with adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK). LKB1
6
phosphorylates and activates AMPK , which functions to regulate cellular energy
9
metabolism under conditions of low ATP . AMPK also contributes to inactivation of mTOR
10
when ATP levels fall, which leads to inhibition of protein synthesis and cell growth .
Therefore, loss of LKB1 leads to dysregulation of cellular metabolism and cell growth under
11
conditions of energy stress , resulting in enhanced sensitivity to drug treatments that target
12
bioenergetic pathways .

Author Manuscript

Most lung cancers express the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and this signaling
pathway is the major target of several drugs in the clinic. EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors
including gefitinib and erlotinib have been shown to suppress oncogenic signaling through
13
downstream pathways such as PI3K-Akt-mTOR and Mek-Erk . NSCLC tumors with
14
certain activating mutations in EGFR show enhanced sensitivity to these compounds .
However, the majority of NSCLC patient tumors possess wild-type EGFR, with only 10–
15
30% harboring a mutant EGFR allele . Although erlotinib has clear therapeutic efficacy in
16 17
some NSCLC tumors bearing wild-type EGFR , and is approved for patients with wild18
type EGFR tumors , it is unclear how to best identify which of these patients may benefit
from treatment with EGFR-targeted inhibitors. Furthermore, the mechanism by which
erlotinib induces selective cell death in wild-type EGFR tumors is not completely known.

Author Manuscript

In EGFR mutant NSCLC cells, erlotinib causes apoptosis through activation of intrinsic
pathways mediated by the induction of BH3-only BIM protein or activation of caspase
19 20
3 , . In these studies, erlotinib treatment was associated with loss of mitochondrial
potential, which resulted in mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis. Interestingly, recent studies
suggest that LKB1 deficiency causes an accumulation of defective mitochondria and loss of
mitochondrial membrane potential, resulting in depletion of hematopoietic stem cells
21
through disruption of mitophagy and mitochondrial homeostasis . Furthermore, the
mitochondrial complex I inhibitor phenformin enhanced apoptosis of LKB1-deficient tumor

cells by depletion of mitochondrial membrane potential compared to wild-type LKB112
reconstituted cells . Therefore, we hypothesized that erlotinib would be more effective at
inducing apoptosis in LKB1-deficient NSCLC cells due to disruption of normal
mitochondrial function, even in the presence of wild-type EGFR.

Author Manuscript

In the present study, we tested whether LKB1-deficient cells were more prone to apoptosis
in response to erlotinib treatment, both in vitro and in vivo, in the absence of mutationally
activated EGFR. Our data demonstrate enhanced antitumor effects of erlotinib in LKB1deficient cells that are associated with loss of mitochondrial function and blockage of mTOR
signaling. Overall, our findings suggest that the LKB1-deficient molecular phenotype may
serve as a predictive marker for erlotinib sensitivity and, if substantiated by further studies,
may provide a rationale for the therapeutic use of erlotinib to treat LKB1-deficient NSCLC.
This is significant because LKB1 mutations are preferentially found in NSCLC tumors with
22 23
wild-type EGFR , , and thus LKB1 loss may define a novel subset of tumors with
enhanced erlotinib sensitivity that is largely distinct from the classical subset possessing
targetable EGFR mutations.

RESULTS
LKB1-deficient cells are more sensitive to inhibition of EGFR-PI3K-mTOR signaling

We sought to determine the relative inhibitory effects of erlotinib, as well as other
compounds that target the EGFR-PI3K-mTOR signaling pathway, across a panel of NSCLC
cell lines that express either wild-type or mutant LKB1. The expressions of LKB1 and
EGFR were assessed by Western blotting in NSCLC cells (Fig. 1A). The NSCLC cells
24 25
tested have been reported to express wild-type EGFR , , and the expression level of
phosphorylated EGFR is shown in Fig 1A. Calu-6, H2009, and H358 cells were previously
26 28
reported to express wild-type LKB1 – , and we confirmed LKB1 protein expression in
these three lines. Next, we asked whether erlotinib could selectively inhibit the viability of
LKB1 mutant cells harboring KRAS mutations but with wild-type EGFR. We found that
LKB1 mutant cells were more sensitive to erlotinib on average (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, 10
μM of the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 did not reduce viability of LKB1 wild-type NSCLC
cells, whereas 30–50% inhibition was observed in LKB1 mutant cells. Sensitivity to
rapamycin was also exacerbated in LKB1 mutant cells. We further assessed the survival of
NSCLC cells using a colony-forming assay where cells were pretreated with inhibitor for 72
h and then grown in inhibitor-free media for two weeks. The colony-forming assay was
more capable of detecting differences in viability at low inhibitor concentrations and
confirmed the finding that LKB1 mutant cells were more sensitive to inhibition of EGFRPI3K-mTOR signaling (Fig. 1C). These results suggest that LKB1 loss confers enhanced
sensitivity to inhibition of the EGFR-PI3K-mTOR signaling pathway in NSCLC cells
harboring wild-type EGFR.
LKB1-deficient transgenic cells exhibit increased sensitivity to erlotinib treatment
A549 and H460 cells (both wild-type EGFR and mutant LKB1) were transduced with
retroviral constructs to stably express wild-type LKB1 or an empty vector control.
Expression of LKB1 and related downstream signaling proteins were verified in these stable

transgenic cells (Fig. 2A, left). LKB1 phosphorylates Thr172 in the activation loop of
29 30
31
AMPKα , and activates AMPK under elevated AMP levels . Activated AMPK
subsequently phosphorylates and inhibits acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC). Overexpression of
LKB1 in A549 and H460 resulted in increased basal phosphorylation of AMPKα and its
downstream target ACC. Erlotinib inhibited growth of LKB1 non-expressing A549
(p<0.0001) and H460 cells (p<0.005) more than LKB1 overexpressing cells (Fig. 2A, right).
Conversely, in stable LKB1-knockdown lines generated from LKB1 wild-type Calu-6 cells,
erlotinib induced a more substantial reduction in growth than the vector control (Fig. 2B,
lower panel). Additionally, erlotinib reduced the colony-forming ability of LKB1knockdown cells more significantly than the vector control (Fig. 2C). These results suggest
that LKB1 deficiency enhances sensitivity to erlotinib by suppressing viability and
tumorigenic potential of NSCLC cells.

Erlotinib treatment selectively inhibits oxidative metabolism and disrupts energy
homeostasis in LKB1-deficient cells

Author Manuscript

We next determined whether erlotinib treatment alters cellular metabolism through analysis
of glucose, lactate, and oxygen exchange rates. Knockdown of LKB1 in Calu-6 cells caused
basal glucose consumption and lactate production to increase significantly compared to
32
vector control cells (Fig. 3A, left), consistent with previously published results .
Measurement of oxygen consumption rate (OCR) also revealed a two-fold increase in basal
oxidative metabolism by shLKB1 Calu-6 cells (Fig. 3B, upper), which was further
confirmed in shLKB1 H358 cells (Supplementary Fig. S1A). Erlotinib treatment reduced
specific growth rates of both vector control and shLKB1 Calu-6 cells in a dose-dependent
manner without affecting glucose uptake or lactate production (Fig. 3A, left). However, the
OCR of shLKB1-expressing Calu-6 and H358 cells was halved by erlotinib treatment (Fig.
3B and Supplementary Fig. S1A). Similar results were observed after re-expressing LKB1 in
A549 and H460 cells. LKB1 mutant A549 and H460 cells exhibited increased glucose
consumption and lactate production compared to LKB1 overexpressing cells (Fig. 3A, right
and Supplementary Fig. 2). Furthermore, OCR was significantly elevated in LKB1 mutant
cells but was reduced >50% by erlotinib treatment (Fig. 3B and Supplementary Fig. S1B). In
contrast to its effects on glycolytic metabolism, the effect of erlotinib to reduce OCR was
significantly enhanced in the LKB1 mutant lines.

Author Manuscript

The reduction in OCR by erlotinib treatment was associated with a significant increase in the
ADP/ATP ratio in shLKB1-expressing Calu-6 and H358 cells (Fig. 3C). In contrast, the
OCR and ADP/ATP ratio of control Calu-6 and H358 cells were not significantly affected by
erlotinib. These results indicate that LKB1-deficient cells were not able to maintain their
elevated rate of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) in the presence of erlotinib treatment,
thus leading to ATP depletion. Several recent articles have shown that loss of LKB1 function
23
leads to increased expression of mitochondria-associated genes but also induces defective
12, 21
mitophagy and accumulation of dysfunctional mitochondria
. Therefore, we
hypothesized that mitochondrial impairments may play a role in the response of LKB1deficient cells to erlotinib treatment.

Erlotinib treatment unmasks mitochondrial defects in LKB1-deficient cells

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Erlotinib-induced apoptosis is associated with loss of mitochondrial membrane potential in
20
EGFR mutant NSCLC cells . Therefore, we asked whether EGFR wild-type NSCLC cells
bearing loss-of-function mutations in LKB1 would show similar mitochondrial defects
following erlotinib treatment. We measured the effect of erlotinib treatment on
mitochondrial potential by using the cationic dye JC-1. Phenformin, a mitochondrial
complex I antagonist, was applied as a positive control to impair mitochondria. As shown in
Fig. 4A, following treatment with erlotinib or phenformin, Calu-6 and H358 cells expressing
shLKB1 exhibited enhanced dissipation of Δψm compared to control cells (red to green ratio
of JC-1), reflecting impaired mitochondrial membrane integrity. Significantly, the Δψm of
untreated shLKB1 cells was higher than vector controls, which is indicative of increased
basal mitochondrial activity and is consistent with the elevated OCR of untreated shLKB1
cells (Fig. 3B). Calu-6 cells expressing shLKB1 also exhibited increased mitochondrial
production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in response to erlotinib treatment (Fig. 4B). We
hypothesized that ATP depletion, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, and ROS
accumulation might by associated with increased apoptosis in LKB1-deficient cells. As
shown in Fig. 4C and 4D, treatment of shLKB1 Calu-6 cells with erlotinib induced cleavage
of PARP and an accumulation of apoptotic cells, suggesting that erlotinib enhances
mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis in LKB1-deficient cells. These data indicate that LKB1deficient cells rely more heavily on mitochondria for energy metabolism under basal
conditions, but they exhibit profound mitochondrial dysfunction in response to erlotinib
treatment as evidenced by Δψm collapse, ATP depletion, ROS accumulation, and apoptosis
activation.
Erlotinib activates AMPKα and blocks mTOR signaling in LKB1-deficient cells

Next, we evaluated the effect of erlotinib on phosphorylation of AMPKα at 3, 6, and 24 h
post-treatment. Interestingly, erlotinib induced phosphorylation of AMPKα after 6 h
treatment in shLKB1 Calu-6 cells (Fig. 5A, left panel), with increased phosphorylation of
acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) apparent by 24 h. A similar increase in ACC
phosphorylation was observed after 24 h treatment in shLKB1 H358 cells (Supplementary
Fig. S3). This effect was not observed in the control cells. In non-transgenic LKB1 mutant
NSCLC cells, erlotinib also induced phosphorylated AMPKα in both H23 and H460 cells
after 3 h treatment (Fig. 5A, right panel). These results indicate that AMPKα remains
sensitive to changes in ATP levels induced by erlotinib treatments in spite of reduced or
abolished LKB1 activity. To confirm the effect of erlotinib to suppress EGFR activation and
signaling through downstream pathways, we performed Western blot analysis of EGFR, Akt,
and mTOR phosphorylation in the presence of exogenous EGF (Fig. 5B). EGF treatment
stimulated phosphorylation of EGFR and Akt in both control and shLKB1 cells. EGFR
phosphorylation was effectively reduced by erlotinib treatment in both cell types, but only
shLKB1 Calu-6 cells exhibited reduced phosphorylation of mTOR in response to erlotinib.
Therefore, we hypothesized that activation of AMPKα in LKB1-deficient cells might confer
sensitivity to erlotinib through inhibition of mTOR signaling. As shown in Fig. 5C, erlotinib
induced phosphorylation of AMPKα in both control and shLKB1 Calu-6 cells after 24 h, but
shLKB1 cells exhibited complete disruption of mTOR pathway signaling following erlotinib
treatment. In particular, AMPKα can directly phosphorylate TSC2 at Ser 1387, which is

involved in inhibition of mTOR signaling. shLKB1 Calu-6 cells exhibited enhanced
phosphorylation of TSC2 (Ser1387) by erlotinib treatment in comparison to control cells.
Furthermore, erlotinib decreased phosphorylation of the 70-kDa ribosomal protein S6 kinase
(p70S6K1) and 4EBP-1, both downstream effectors of mTOR signaling. Erlotinib treatment
reduced phosphorylation of Akt in all cells, but phosphorylated Erk was not changed. These
effects of erlotinib on AMPK and mTOR pathway signaling were further confirmed in
H358, A549, and H460 cells. For example, shLKB1 H358 cells exhibited enhanced
phosphorylation of AMPKα and inhibition of mTOR signaling in response to erlotinib
treatment (Supplementary Fig. S4A), whereas LKB1 overexpressing A549 and H460 cells
were less sensitive to mTOR inhibition by erlotinib in comparison to vector control cells
(Supplementary Fig. S4B). These results indicate that erlotinib induces phosphorylation of
AMPKα in both control and LKB1-deficient cells, but its effect to block mTOR pathway
signaling is enhanced in LKB1-deficient cells, resulting in repression of protein synthesis
and inhibition of cell growth.

Author Manuscript

We then asked whether an alternative kinase other than LKB1 could be responsible for
erlotinib-induced activation of AMPKα in LKB1-deficient cells. In a previous study, it was
shown that AMPKα can become phosphorylated in response to energy stress, even in the
absence of functional LKB1, through the action of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein
33
kinase kinase 2 (CaMKKβ) . To elucidate the mechanism by which erlotinib treatment can
induce phosphorylation of AMPKα in LKB1-deficient cells, we used STO-609, a CaMKKβ
inhibitor, and BAPTA-AM, an intracellular calcium chelator. After 24 h of treatment, both
STO-609 and BAPTA-AM were able to partially inhibit erlotinib-induced AMPK
phosphorylation in shLKB1 Calu-6 cells (Fig. 5D). This partially blocked erlotinib’s ability
to inhibit mTOR and induce apoptosis in shLKB1 Calu-6 cells. These results indicate that
AMPKα activation can be stimulated by erlotinib-induced changes in intracellular ADP/ATP
levels and CAMKKβ activity, even in the absence of functional LKB1. This provides a
mechanistic explanation for erlotinib’s ability to activate AMPKα and suppress mTOR
signaling in LKB1-deficient cells.
Erlotinib reduces tumor volume in shLKB1 Calu-6 tumor xenografts

Author Manuscript

Finally, we investigated the in vivo antitumor activity of erlotinib in nude mice bearing
control and shLKB1 Calu-6 subcutaneous tumors. As expected, mice bearing shLKB1
Calu-6 tumor xenografts showed the highest tumor volumes (Fig. 6A, left panel). Mean
tumor volume in mice bearing shLKB1 tumors was significantly reduced at 2 and 3 weeks of
erlotinib treatment, as compared with control-treated mice (Fig. 6A, right panel). No toxic
effects (such as severe reduction in body weight) were observed in erlotinib-treated groups.
We performed histological analyses of tumor samples by H&E immunohistochemical
staining and found clear signs of large necrotic areas in shLKB1 tumor xenografts treated
with erlotinib, but not in control xenografts (Fig. 6B). We also collected tissue samples from
tumors to determine the in vivo effects of erlotinib treatment on activation of AMPKα,
mTOR, p70S6K, and cleaved PARP (Fig. 6C). We first detected levels of LKB1 expression
in control and shLKB1 Calu-6 tumor tissues from mice. As shown by Western blotting,
levels of LKB1 protein were highly reduced in shLKB1 Calu-6 xenograft tumors as
compared to control tumors. Consistent with in vitro results, erlotinib treatment enhanced

AMPK phosphorylation, inhibited mTOR-related downstream signaling proteins, and
increased PARP cleavage in shLKB1 Calu-6 xenograft tumors only. These results suggest
that erlotinib treatment significantly reduced tumor growth in shLKB1 Calu-6 tumor
xenografts through inhibition of mTOR signaling and induction of apoptosis.

DISCUSSION

Author Manuscript

Although erlotinib exhibits potent anti-cancer activity against human NSCLC tumors with
activating mutations in EGFR, it also has activity in some patients with wild-type EGFR. It
has been unclear what molecular mechanisms drive this sensitivity and, furthermore, how to
identify wild-type EGFR tumors that might be susceptible to erlotinib treatment. In the
present study, we found that NSCLC cells harboring wild-type EGFR show varying
sensitivity to erlotinib treatment that is dependent on LKB1 status. We demonstrated that
erlotinib suppressed viability and enhanced apoptosis of LKB1-deficient NSCLC cells both
in vitro and in vivo. Another study recently reported that glioblastoma cells with wild-type
EGFR exhibited sensitivity to erlotinib treatment that was associated with inhibition of
34
autophagy but was independent of caspase activity . Consistent with this report, our
findings indicate that erlotinib can be beneficial even in tumors that are not EGFR mutated.
However, we show that apoptosis is elevated in erlotinib-treated cells and that the inhibitory
effects of erlotinib are enhanced in tumors that have dysregulated LKB1-AMPK pathway
signaling. Because this signaling pathway normally serves to maintain mitochondrial
function and bioenergetic homeostasis in response to metabolic stress, we hypothesized that
LKB1-deficient cells may be compromised in their ability to cope with metabolic alterations
induced by erlotinib treatment.

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

To further examine the mechanism of erlotinib-induced apoptosis in LKB1-deficient
NSCLC cells, we analyzed changes in glycolytic metabolism and mitochondrial function
resulting from LKB1 knockdown. Interestingly, we observed that glucose consumption and
lactate production by Calu-6 cells increased by more than 50% in response to LKB1
knockdown, which correlated with increased growth and colony formation (Fig. 2C). We
also observed substantial increases in OCR (Fig. 3B) and Δψm (Fig. 4A) after expression of
shLKB1 in Calu-6 and H358 cells, consistent with another recent study that profiled gene
expression of over 600 patient tumors and reported upregulation of OXPHOS and
23
mitochondria-associated genes in samples classified as LKB1-deficient . The effect of
LKB1 loss to activate glycolysis and oxidative metabolism was further confirmed by
expressing wild-type LKB1 in mutant A549 and H460 cell lines (Figs. 2A, 2B,
32
Supplementary Figs. S1, S2). Faubert et al. previously reported simultaneous increases in
both glucose uptake and lactate production in response to complete LKB1 knockout in
transgenic mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). They also noted enhanced flux of both
glucose and glutamine into the TCA cycle of LKB1 mutant A549 cells in comparison to
cells expressing wild-type LKB1, based on isotope labeling experiments with 13C-glucose
and 13C-glutamine tracers. These previous findings are consistent with our own results
indicating increased dependence of LKB1-deficient cells on mitochondrial metabolism to
support enhanced cell proliferation.

Despite elevated rates of oxidative metabolism, we observed only slight changes in basal
ADP/ATP ratios and ROS levels in LKB1 knockdown cells (Fig. 3C and 4B). However, the
effect of LKB1 depletion to alter mitochondrial function became readily apparent when
shLKB1 cells were challenged with erlotinib. Substantial increases in ADP/ATP and ROS
levels were observed, which were accompanied by depletion of Δψm (Fig. 4A). In contrast,
control cells were able to maintain normal ADP/ATP, ROS, and Δψm levels in response to
the same concentration of erlotinib (Fig. 3C, 4A, 4B). Taken together, these data provide a
clear indication that LKB1 is required for maintenance of mitochondrial function in the
presence of erlotinib treatment. As a result, LKB1-deficient cells cannot effectively restore
ATP levels or prevent ROS accumulation in response to erlotinib, resulting in selective
growth inhibition (Fig. 2) and apoptosis activation (Fig. 4C and 4D). In this context, we view
the decoupling of ROS from OCR and Δψm measurements as an indicator of mitochondrial
dysfunction following erlotinib treatment. These results are similar to those reported by
12
Shackelford et al. , where significant increases in ROS and decreases in Δψm were
simultaneously observed in response to phenformin treatment of LKB1-mutant A549 cells.
Our results are also consistent with another previous study that showed AMPK-deficient
cells are unable to maintain sufficient NADPH levels needed to neutralize mitochondrial
35
ROS during metabolic stress , a mechanism which may further contribute to the enhanced
erlotinib sensitivity we observed in LKB1-deficient cells.

Author Manuscript

Despite the previously described similarities, our observations of increased basal
mitochondrial activity in LKB1-deficient cells are also partially at odds with the results of
12
Shackelford et al. . Their study showed that re-expressing wild-type LKB1 in A549 cells
led to enhancements of basal OCR and Δψm, implying reduced mitochondrial activity in the
12
32
parental, LKB1-deficient cells . In contrast, a more recent study by Faubert et al.
showed no change in OCR after re-expressing LKB1 in A549 cells and a reduction in OCR
after re-expressing LKB1 in A427 cells, which are also LKB1 mutant-type. Therefore, there
is some variability in the prior literature concerning the effects that manipulating LKB1
expression has on markers of mitochondrial activity. It is possible that these differences
could be attributable to adaptation of LKB1 mutant cells to the re-expression of LKB1 over
many generations. Since our studies were completed within ten passages following antibiotic
selection, our results likely capture the immediate response to LKB1 re-expression in the
absence of long-term adaptation.

Author Manuscript

Another unexpected outcome of our study was that LKB1-deficient cells still exhibited a
robust ability to activate AMPK in response to increases in ADP/ATP ratio following
erlotinib treatment. AMPK activation by adenine nucleotides involves at least three
independent mechanisms: (1) increased AMP-dependent phosphorylation by LKB1, (2)
inhibitory effects of AMP on its dephosphorylation, and (3) allosteric activation by AMP
36
and ADP . The latter two mechanisms do not require LKB1. We also found that the ability
of erlotinib to induce phosphorylation of AMPKα in LKB1-deficient cells was partially
inhibited by co-treatment with either STO-609 or BAPTA-AM (Fig. 5D), indicating
involvement of CaMKKβ as an alternative kinase that contributes to erlotinib-induced
AMPK phosphorylation. Two prior articles have reported that AMPK phosphorylation by
37 38
CaMKKβ is dependent on AMP and ADP levels , . The large increase in ADP/ATP ratio
we observed following erlotinib treatment could therefore be sufficient to activate AMPK

even when LKB1 was depleted, possibly by a CaMKKβ-dependent mechanism. We cannot
rule out, however, that changes in Ca2+ levels may synergize with changes in energy charge
to stimulate AMPK activation in response to erlotinib treatment. Consistent with this
hypothesis, gefitinib has been reported to increase cytosolic and mitochondrial calcium
39
levels of Bcl-2-overexpressing cells .

Author Manuscript

Inhibition of Erk signaling has also been shown to induce pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4
41
(PDK4) expression and redirect cellular metabolism in mammary epithilia . However, we
do not expect that changes in Mek/Erk signaling or PDK4 expression were directly involved
in regulating the metabolic response to erlotinib treatment in our studies. First, no significant
change in Erk phosphorylation was observed in response to erlotinib treatment of Calu-6
cells (Fig. 5C, Supplementary Fig. S4). Second, if PDK4 expression was induced by
erlotinib treatment, we would expect to see increased lactate production due to inhibition of
pyruvate dehydrogenase flux. However, this was not observed in any of the cell lines tested.
Finally, to confirm these observations, we performed Western blots with an anti-PDK4
antibody in LKB1 overexpressing and stable knockdown cell lines (Supplementary Fig S5).
No significant changes in PDK4 expression were observed after 24 hours of erlotinib
treatment. Taken together, we conclude that erlotinib treatment reduces OCR in LKB1deficient cells independently of Erk and PDK4.

Erlotinib-mediated AMPKα activation led to inhibition of mTOR phosphorylation in LKB1deficient cells, which correlated with inhibition of phosphorylated p70S6K and 4EBP-1
(Fig. 5C) as major downstream effectors of the mTOR signaling pathway. These data are
consistent with the known role of AMPK to suppress mTOR signaling in response to low
10 40
ATP levels, leading to inhibition of protein synthesis and proliferation of cancer cells , .
Previous studies suggested that loss of LKB1 induced increased cell size and mass due to
failure of AMPK to inhibit mTOR signaling (31, 32). In contrast, we found that only LKB1deficient cells effectively suppressed mTOR signaling and induced PARP cleavage in
response to erlotinib treatments, both in vitro and in vivo. This led to a significant decrease
in growth of LKB1-deficient xenograft tumors. It is likely that mitochondrial dysfunction
associated with LKB1 deficiency sensitizes cells to erlotinib treatment by enhancing
changes in ADP/ATP and ROS levels, which subsequently activate AMPK and suppress
mTOR signaling.

In conclusion, we demonstrate for the first time that erlotinib induces apoptosis in EGFR
wild-type NSCLC cells by a mechanism that is enhanced by LKB1 loss of function (Fig. 7).
Although LKB1-deficient cells relied more heavily on mitochondrial OXPHOS for energy
production under basal conditions, they could not properly respond to metabolic stress
induced by erlotinib treatment in order to maintain energetic homeostasis. These metabolic
alterations were associated with more pronounced AMPK activation and inhibition of
mTOR signaling in LKB1-deficient cells, resulting in increased sensitivity to erlotinib
treatment. Taken together, our findings provide a rationale for erlotinib treatment of LKB1deficient NSCLC tumors, even in the absence of EGFR activating mutations. These tumors
may constitute a distinct NSCLC molecular subtype with enhanced erlotinib sensitivity,
which motivates the development of novel diagnostic approaches (e.g., mRNA expression

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture and reagents

Author Manuscript

Human NSCLC Calu-6, H358, H2009, H460, H23, H2122, HCC15, and A549 cell lines
were generously shared with us by John Minna and Luc Girard (University of Texas,
Southwestern). Cells were tested to ensure that they were mycoplasma negative. The human
NSCLC cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum (FBS; GIBCO-BRL, Gaithersburg, MD) in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2.
A549 and H460 cells stably expressing either an empty pBABE vector (vector) or wild-type
LKB1 (LKB1) were generated by retroviral transduction. The empty pBABE viral plasmid
and pBABE-LKB1 plasmid were obtained from Addgene (Cambridge, MA). Phoenix cells
were transfected with viral plasmids and retroviral particles were harvested from media
supernatant 48 hours after transfection. Viruses were added to target cells with polybrene,
and selection with 1μg/ml puromycin was begun 48–72 hours after infection. Cells were
selected under puromycin for one to two weeks before performing subsequent experiments,
with experiments being completed within two months. Erlotinib (an inhibitor of EGFR),
LY294002 (an inhibitor of PI3K), and rapamycin (an inhibitor of mTOR) were purchased
from LC Laboratories (Woburn, MA).
Cell viability analysis, colony formation assays, and growth rate measurements

Author Manuscript

Cells were plated in 96-well plates in complete medium and treated with various
concentrations of erlotinib, LY294002, or rapamycin. Cell viability was analyzed after 2
days of treatment using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide
(MTT) assay according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). Cell
proliferation was analyzed every 8 or 16 h for 3 days after erlotinib treatment using the
CyQUANT® Direct Cell Proliferation Assay according to the manufacturer’s protocol
(Invitrogen, Frederick, MD). The fluorescence intensity was measured with a fluorescence
microplate reader (Bio-Tek Instruments, Winooski, VT). Conditioned medium samples were
collected from each well prior to CyQUANT analysis, frozen, and stored for metabolite
analysis. Colony formation assays were performed following treatment with 5 μM erlotinib
for 3 days, at which time the cells were replated in six-well plates at low density (1 × 103
cells per well) in complete medium for 2 weeks. Colonies were fixed with methanol and
stained with 0.1% crystal violet (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). Colony numbers were
assessed visually and colonies measuring at least 50 μm were counted.

Metabolite analysis and oxygen consumption rate
Conditioned medium samples collected during cell growth experiments were subjected to
glucose and lactate analysis using a YSI 2300 biochemical analyzer (YSI Life Science,
Yellow Springs, OH). The ETA software package was applied to calculate specific rates of
42
glucose consumption and lactate production using an exponential growth model . Oxygen
consumption rate (OCR) was measured using the Oxygraph-2K (Oroboros, Innsbruck,
Austria), which contains two chambers with separate oxygen probes to monitor on-line

changes in oxygen concentration. The instrument was set to a temperature of 37 °C, and the
stirring speed for each chamber was 750 rpm. After treatment with erlotinib for 24 h, cells
were then trypsinized, resuspended in the same culture medium at a concentration of 1–2 ×
106 cells per mL, and injected into the Oxygraph instrument.
LKB1 stable knockdown using lentiviral short-hairpin RNA

Author Manuscript

For generation of stable knockdown cells, lentiviral LKB1 short-hairpin RNA (shRNA)
constructs and a non-targeting shRNA control were purchased from Open Biosystems
(Huntsville, AL). These constructs were cloned into a pLKO.1 vector. HEK293T cells (2 ×
106 cells) were plated on 100 mm dishes and one day later were co-transfected with 5 μg
shRNA constructs, 3 μg pCMV-dR8.2 dvpr (Addgene) and 2 μg pCMV-VSV-G (Addgene)
using a calcium phosphate transfection kit (Invitrogen). After 6 h, the medium was
exchanged with fresh medium, and then the viral stock was collected for 1–2 days and
filtered to remove non-adherent HEK293T cells. To obtain stable shRNA expressing clones,
Calu-6 or H358 cells were plated on six-well plates, and one day later infected with 1 ml of
lentiviral suspension plus 4 μg/ml polybrene. Puromycin selection (0.5–2 μg/ml) was
initiated 2 days after lentiviral infection.
Western blotting

Author Manuscript

Total cell lysates were resolved using sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis, and then transferred onto polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes
(EMD Millipore Corporation, Billerica, MA). Western blotting was performed as described
43
previously . The following antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling (Danvers, MA):
rabbit polyclonal antibodies against LKB1, phosphorylated AMPKα, phosphorylated acetylCoA carboxylase (ACC), phosphorylated Tuberin/TSC2 (Ser1387), phosphorylated mTOR
(Ser2448), phosphorylated 4EBP1 (Thr37/46), phosphorylated Akt (Ser473),
phosphorylated Erk (Thr202/Tyr204), poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), and mouse
monoclonal antibodies against phosphorylated p70S6K (Thr389). A goat polyclonal antiactin antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz (Santa Cruz, CA). All experiments were
performed in triplicate.
Flow cytometry

Author Manuscript

Cells were seeded in six-well plates containing complete medium and treated with 5 μM or
10 μM erlotinib. After 72 h, cells were harvested, pooled, and fixed with 1%
paraformaldehyde and 70% ethanol. Apoptosis was assessed with flow cytometry using the
Annexin V-FITC Apoptosis kit (Clontech, Mountain View, CA). To measure mitochondrial
ROS after 24 h of erlotinib treatment, cells were stained with MitoSOX Red (Molecular
Probes, Eugene, OR) for 40 min at 37 °C in the dark. Annexin V and MitoSOX Red were
analyzed using a LSRII flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA).
Assessment of ADP/ATP ratio and mitochondrial membrane potential
Cells were seeded in 96-well plates and treated with 25 μM erlotinib for 24 h. Intracellular
ADP/ATP ratio was measured using a bioluminescent ADP/ATP Ratio Assay Kit according
to the manufacturer’s instructions (Abcam, Cambridge, MA). Mitochondrial membrane

depolarization was determined using the JC-1 fluorescence probe according to the
manufacturer’s instructions (Molecular Probes). Cells were labeled with 2 μM JC-1 for 30
min at 37 °C in the dark and then analyzed at 488 nm excitation with 530/30 or 585/42 nm
bypass emission filters using a fluorescence microplate reader (Bio-TeK Instruments).
Animal experiments

Author Manuscript

The research protocol for animal studies was approved by and carried out in accordance with
the Vanderbilt Institutional Animal Care & Use Committee. Four- to five-week old female
Foxn1nu/nu nude mice were purchased from Harlan Laboratories (Indianapolis, IN). Both
non-targeting shRNA (shCon, LKB1 wild-type) and LKB1 shRNA (shLKB1, LKB1
knockdown) Calu-6 cells were injected s.c. into the left /right flanks at 5 × 106 cells per
mouse mixed 1:1 with 100% growth factor-reduced Matrigel (BD Bioscience, San Jose,
CA). The mice were randomly assigned to shCon + vehicle solution (in sodium
carboxymethylcellulose and Tween 80), shCon + erlotinib, shLKB1+ vehicle solution, and
shLKB1 + erlotinib, with each group containing eight to ten mice. After 1 week, mice were
treated with vehicle or erlotinib (100 mg/kg) daily by oral gavage for 3 weeks. Tumor size
44
was calculated by measuring the tumors in three dimensions using calipers twice a week ,
while body weight was measured twice weekly. On day 21, mice were euthanized and tumor
tissues were harvested for pathologic examination (immunohistochemical analysis) and
analyzed by Western blotting.
Statistical analyses

Author Manuscript

The data acquired with MTT, colony formation, and ADP/ATP assays were analyzed using
the Student’s t-test. The Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare differences in tumor
weight. In all of the statistical analyses, two-sided p-values less than 0.05 were considered
statistically significant.

Figure 5. Erlotinib-induced activation of AMPKα selectively inhibits mTOR signaling pathway
in LKB1-deficient cells

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

(a) Left panel: Erlotinib activated AMPKα and inhibited ACC in shLKB1 Calu-6 cells.
Following treatment with 0.5 μM erlotinib for the indicated time, cell lysates were analyzed
by Western blotting. The expression of phosphorylated AMPKα was calculated as the ratio
of phosphorylated AMPKα to total AMPKα protein expression using densitometric
analysis. The ratio of phosphorylated to total ACC was calculated similarly. All expression
ratios were normalized to the untreated group. Right panel: Erlotinib also induced
phosphorylated AMPKα in LKB1 mutant H23 and H460 cells. (b) Erlotinib inhibited EGFstimulated EGFR phosphorylation and mTOR phosphorylation in shLKB1 Calu-6 cells.
Cells were treated with 0.5 μM erlotinib for 72 h. After serum starvation for 24 h, cells were
stimulated by 100 ng/ml EGF for 10 minutes and cell lysates were then analyzed by Western
blotting. (c) Erlotinib blocked mTOR pathway signaling and activated AMPKα in shLKB1
Calu-6 cells. After 24 h of 0.5 μM erlotinib treatment, cell lysates were analyzed by Western
blotting using specific antibodies for the indicated proteins. Blockade of mTOR activity
following erlotinib treatment resulted in decreased phosphorylation of p70S6K and p-4EBP1
in shLKB1 Calu-6 cells. (d) Erlotinib-induced pAMPKα phosphorylation was reduced by
addition of STO-609 (a CAMKKβ inhibitor) or BAPTA-AM (an intracellular calcium
chelator) in shLKB1 Calu-6 cells. Cells were co-treated with 0.5 μM erlotinib and 2.5 μM
STO-609 or 4 μM BAPTA-AM for 24 h and cell lysates were analyzed by Western blotting.
The blots are representative of three independent experiments.

Figure 6. Erlotinib induces a significant reduction of tumor volume in shLKB1 mice

Author Manuscript

(a) Mean tumor volumes for each treatment group of the pLKO.1 control vector (dil, n=10,
erlo, n=8) and shLKB1 vector (dil, n=10, erlo, n=10) mice after 1 week of treatment. Female
nude mice were injected subcutaneously into the left/right flanks with 5 × 106 control or
shLKB1 Calu-6 cells per mouse mixed 1:1 with 100% Matrigel. After 7 days, mice were
treated with diluent (dil) or erlotinib (erlo) in sodium carboxymethylcellulose and Tween 80
solution o.p. at 100 mg/kg daily. Body weight was measured twice a week, and drug
administration was adjusted accordingly. Tumors were measured twice a week with a
caliper. Dots: individual tumor volumes (mm3). Horizontal lines: median and inter-quartile
ranges. p-values are from linear regression analyses and Mann Whitney U test. (b) H&E

Figure 7. Hypothetical schema of erlotinib-induced cell death in LKB1-deficient cells

Author Manuscript

LKB1-deficient cells exhibit enhanced mitochondrial metabolism as indicated by increased
mitochondrial potential and OCR. Erlotinib treatment selectively induces mitochondrial
dysfunction in LKB1-deficient cells, decreasing mitochondrial potential and OCR while
increasing ADP/ATP and ROS. This has the dual effect of inhibiting growth (via activation
of AMPK and suppression of mTOR signaling) and activating apoptosis. This mechanism is
based on composite data from our in vitro studies on multiple LKB1 wild-type (Calu-6,
H358) and LKB1 mutant (A549, H460) cell lines, as well as in vivo data from Calu-6 mouse
xenografts.
