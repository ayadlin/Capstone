ABSTRACT
Hypoxia-inducible genes may contribute to therapy resistance in glioblastoma
(GBM), the most aggressive and hypoxic brain tumours. It has been recently reported
that erythropoietin (EPO) and its receptor (EPOR) are involved in glioma growth. We
now investigated whether EPOR signalling may modulate the efficacy of the GBM
current treatment based on chemotherapy (temozolomide, TMZ) and radiotherapy
(X-rays). Using RNA interference, we showed on glioma cell lines (U87 and U251)
that EPOR silencing induces a G2/M cell cycle arrest, consistent with the slowdown
of glioma growth induced by EPOR knock-down. In vivo, we also reported that EPOR
silencing combined with TMZ treatment is more efficient to delay tumour recurrence
and to prolong animal survival compared to TMZ alone. In vitro, we showed that EPOR
silencing not only increases the sensitivity of glioma cells to TMZ as well as X-rays
but also counteracts the hypoxia-induced chemo- and radioresistance. Silencing
EPOR on glioma cells exposed to conventional treatments enhances senescence and
induces a robust genomic instability that leads to caspase-dependent mitotic death by
increasing the number of polyploid cells and cyclin B1 expression. Overall these data
suggest that EPOR could be an attractive target to overcome therapeutic resistance
toward ionising radiation or temozolomide.

INTRODUCTION

are needed. These tumours frequently exhibit hypoxia
which promotes angiogenesis, invasion, glioma stem cell
recruitment and tumour aggressiveness [4–6]. Hypoxia is
likewise associated with poor response of GBM to radioor chemotherapy [7–9]. The transcription factor Hypoxiainducible factor-1 (HIF-1), one of the main regulators
that orchestrates the cellular responses to hypoxia, is
up-regulated in GBM and correlates with a poor patient
prognosis [10–12]. It regulates the expression of a large
number of hypoxia-responsive genes, including vascular

Glioblastoma (GBM) are the most frequent primary
malignant brain tumours in adults [1,2] but are still
incurable despite current therapy including neurosurgery,
alkylating agent based-chemotherapy with temozolomide
(TMZ) and ionising radiation. Yet the survival median
of GBM patients remains only around 15 months and
the five-year survival is less than 10% [3]. Thus, both

endothelial growth factor (VEGF), the main regulator of
angiogenesis that explains the intense vascular hyperplasia
often seen in GBM. Thereby, therapies that target
angiogenesis have generated substantial interest. In 2009,
bevacizumab, a humanised monoclonal antibody against
VEGF received accelerated approval from the US Food
and Drug Administration for treatment of recurrent GBM
but also as adjuvant treatments. However, the benefits of
bevacizumab in combination or not with chemotherapy
and radiotherapy are transient and tumours progress
after only 3-5 months [13–18]. Thus, more efforts are yet
required to develop effective therapeutics and overcome
resistance to current treatments.
Recently, we and others have shown that
erythropoietin (EPO), another major target gene of HIF
activation, plays a role in tumour progression since GBM
cells and glioma stem cells synthesise EPO and express
its receptor [19–22]. We have shown, at the preclinical
level, that EPOR silencing on glioma cells slows down
the tumour growth through a proliferative arrest and we
now speculate that EPOR signalling could modulate the
sensitivity of glioma cells to chemo- or radiotherapy.
Because abrogation of the G2 checkpoint prevents
cells from repairing DNA damage and forces apoptosis, it
has emerged as an attractive therapeutic target to further
improve the cytotoxic effects of anticancer therapies
such as radiation or drugs [23–25]. More recently,
G2 checkpoint has also been recognised to be crucial
to impede mitotic death [26–28]. The importance of
mitotic catastrophe as well as senescence is increasingly
being recognised as tumour suppression mechanisms
[29–31]. Permanently arresting tumour cells through the
induction of senescence might improve anti-tumour agent
efficacy. Indeed, cell senescence, originally defined as
a proliferative arrest that occurs in normal cells is now
considered as a general biological program of terminal
growth arrest [32], which can be activated in tumour cells
in response to DNA damage induced by chemotherapeutic
drugs or radiation treatments [33–36]. The impact of
accelerated senescence on the efficacy of chemo- and
radiotherapy mainly depends on whether senescence
arrest is followed by cell death including apoptosis,
autophagy or mitotic catastrophe when the DNA damage
response is inactivated or impaired. Mitotic catastrophe
is a form of cell death that results from aberrant mitosis
and leads to the formation of large nonviable cells with
micronuclei. Rather than a true cell death mechanism,
mitotic catastrophe might constitute an oncosuppressive
pathway that can precede cell death [30,37–40]. Thus,
mitotic catastrophe may end in apoptosis-like cell death
when caspases are active or in a caspase-independent cell
death leading to necrosis [41–45].
In this study, we show that EPOR down-regulation,
by inducing G2/M cell cycle arrest and senescence of
human glioma cells U87 or U251, improves the efficacy
of radio- and chemotherapy, in both normoxic and hypoxic
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

conditions. Silencing EPOR on glioma cells exposed to
ionising radiation (X-rays) or chemotherapy (TMZ)
enhances senescence and induces mitotic cell death,
an effect that may be through an increase in cyclin B1
expression.

RESULTS
EPOR down-regulation induces G2/M cell cycle
arrest in glioma cells
We previously showed that the inhibition of EPOR
expression on U87 glioma cells leads to a decrease in their
doubling time (Figure S1 supplementary data) and slows
down the proliferation of U87 glioma cells in vitro as well
as tumour growth in vivo [22]. We now show that EPOR
silencing in U87 cells is associated with a cell cycle arrest
in G2/M phase with a cell progression from a diploid to a
polyploid state (Figure 1A) compared to U87-control and
U87-scrambled cells. As presented on the Figure 1B, the
proportion of U87-shEPOR cells arrested in G2/M phase
(p<0.0001) as well as in polyploidy (p<0.05) is strongly
increased (2-fold increase) whereas the cell number in
G0/G1 (p<0.0001) and S (p<0.05) phases is significantly
decreased relative to U87-scrambled or U87-control cells.
We next checked whether the increase in the cell number
in G2/M phase was linked to a G2 arrest and was not due
to tetraploid cells in G1 phase. To this end, we verified
that this increase persists independently of the cellular
density (Figure S2 supplementary data) and we studied
the level of cyclin B1 expression, used as a marker of G2
arrest, and cyclin D1 expression, as a specific protein of
G1/S phase. Relative to U87-scrambled cells, we show
that EPOR knock-down decreases the expression of cyclin
D1 by 40% paralleled with a 210% increase in cyclin B1
(Figure 1C).

EPOR down-regulation improves the efficacy of
radiotherapy on glioma cells
Since tumour cells in G2/M phase are known to be
more radiosensitive [46,47], we next determined whether
EPOR silencing affected the efficacy of radiotherapy on
glioma cells. Hypoxia and p53 status of tumour cells
are known to contribute to radioresistance [48–50].
Accordingly, we studied the radiosensitivity of glioma
cells expressing or not EPOR in response to increasing
dose of ionising radiation both in normoxic and hypoxic
conditions. In addition to p53 wild-type U87 cells, we
evaluated the response of p53 mutant type U251 cells
to X-rays which express more strongly hypoxia-induced
genes than U87 cells [51–53]. Radiation survival curves
obtained from clonogenic assays (Figure 2A) show similar
radiation sensitivity of U87-control and U87-scrambled

cells in normoxia and, as expected, both cell lines display
a radioresistance in hypoxia. Similar results are obtained
with U251-control and U251-scrambled cells (Figure
2A). However, compared to the control cells, EPOR
down-regulation on U87 or U251 glioma cells increases
their sensitivity to radiation in normoxia (Figure 2A).
Interestingly, in hypoxia, the increase in radiosensitivity
is sustained and similar to that observed in normoxia for
U87-shEPOR and U251-shEPOR cells. Radiobiological
parameters estimated from the survival curves also reflect
the greater harmful effect of X-rays on glioma cells in
which EPOR expression was down-regulated (Figure
2B). For instance, for U251-scrambled cells, the surviving
fraction at 2 Gy (SF2) is 55% in normoxia and rises to 74%
in hypoxia, whereas the level of cell survival decreases
to 41% and 45% for U251-shEPOR cells cultured in
normoxia and hypoxia conditions, respectively. To assess

and characterise the radiation-enhancing effects of EPOR
inhibition on the glioma cells, the radiation dose required
to reduce the survival fraction from 100% to 37%, namely
D0 (mean lethal dose), was also calculated. D0 is considered
as a measure of the intrinsic radiosensitivity of the cells.
In normoxia, control, scrambled and shEPOR-infected
U251 glioma cells exhibit D0 value of 2.9, 2.9 and 2.2 Gy
respectively, and in hypoxia, D0 value of 4.1, 4.0 and 2.4
Gy (Figure 2B). Similar results are observed for the U87
cells (Figure 2B). This parameter also allows determining
a sensitisation enhancement ratio (SER), calculated by
determining the ratio of D0 of the control group versus
infected glioma cells (SER>1 reflects a sensitisation
to treatment). The increase in the SER for both U87shEPOR and U251-shEPOR cells clearly indicates a
radiosensitisation potential by inhibiting EPOR on glioma
cells (Figure 2B). From D0 values, effects of oxygen

EPOR down-regulation increases the sensitivity of
glioma cells to chemotherapy

on intrinsic radiation sensitivity can be also expressed
quantitatively by the oxygen enhancement ratio (OER),
which is defined as the ratio of D0 in hypoxia on D0 in
normoxia. An OER value superior to 1 reflects a hypoxiainduced radioresistance, as it can be observed for U87control cells (OER=1.75, p<0.05) and U87-scrambled cells
(OER=1.62, p<0.05) as well as U251 cells (OER=1.42
and 1.37 for the U251-control and scrambled cells,
respectively, p<0.05). However, the OER values of U87shEPOR and U251-shEPOR indicate that EPOR knockdown counteracts the hypoxia-dependent radioresistance
(Figure 2B). Collectively, these results provide evidence
that EPOR is involved in the radiosensitivity of glioma
cells not only in normoxia but also in hypoxia conditions.

We then sought to investigate whether the EPOR
inhibition on glioma cells could also modulate their
chemosensitivity to TMZ. As presented on the Table 1, in
normoxia, no significant difference in the TMZ toxicity
is measured between control and scrambled-infected
glioma cells. In contrast, EPOR silencing sensitises U87
or U251 cells to chemotherapy. The association of EPOR
inhibition with TMZ treatment induces a greater decrease
in glioma cell number as evidenced by the SER values
of 1.78 and 2.44 for U87-shEPOR and U251-shEPOR

Figure 2: EPOR inhibition increases the sensitivity of glioma cells to ionising radiation and counteracts the hypoxiadependant radioresistance. The colony-formation assay was performed to determine the effects of various doses of X-rays (0, 2, 4, 6

radiation, for U251 and U87 cells respectively, to determine survival fraction (SF) and radiobiological parameters. (A) Effect of EPOR

Table 1: EPOR inhibition improves the response of glioma cells to temozolomide and reduces the hypoxiadependent chemoresistance. TMZ treatment (25 µM) was performed in normoxic (21% O2) and hypoxic (1% O2) conditions on

U87 and U251 cells and cell survival was determined at 72 hours post-treatment. The surviving fraction (SF= cell number after TMZ
treatment/ untreated cell number) was evaluated by counting the cell nuclei staining with Hoechst 33342. Mean ± SD, n=4; for SF:

cells respectively (Table 1). However, in hypoxia, the
chemosensitivity is still observed for U87-shEPOR and
U251-shEPOR cells, while hypoxia inhibits the toxicity
of TMZ on the corresponding control cells. For each cell
type, the chemoresistance induced by hypoxia might be
illustrated by the OER (Table 1). The OER reaches a
value superior to 1 for control and scrambled cells while
it decreases to a value of respectively 0.99 and 0.73 for
U87-shEPOR and U251-shEPOR cells, confirming
the absence of TMZ drug resistance of glioma cells in
hypoxic conditions when the EPOR expression is knockdown. We then sought to determine whether the TMZ
chemosensitisation induced by the silencing of EPOR
on glioma cells is retrieved in vivo. We used the U251
orthotopic model since in addition to hypoxia, this tumour
model recapitulates most of the main pathological features
described in human GBM [54–56]. As presented on
Figure 3A, and according to our previous study [22], the
extinction of EPOR on glioma cells slows down tumour
growth by a factor two relative to control tumours. When
the tumours reached an equivalent volume of 30-40 mm3
(i.e. U251-scrambled and U251-shEPOR groups were
treated from 26 days and 54 days post-implantation,
respectively), animals were treated or not with TMZ
(10 mg/kg/day) for 5 consecutive days. A transient toxic
effect of TMZ is observed for U251-scrambled group
leading first to a significant decrease in tumour volume
lasting 3 weeks post-treatment, but eventually followed
by a tumour recurrence observed 55 days post-TMZ
treatment. A similar kinetic profile of the tumour response
to TMZ chemotherapy is observed for U251-shEPOR
group (Figure 3A), but with a better efficacy. Indeed, the
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

combination of EPOR inhibition with TMZ potentiates
the cytotoxic effect of TMZ alone and this effect is
maintained during 4 weeks post-treatment (p<0.0001)
(Figure 3A). Therefore, 1 week after TMZ treatment, the
tumour volume, calculated from MRI analyses, decreases
by 57% for U251-scrambled tumours (p<0.0001) and
by 77% for U251-shEPOR tumours (p<0.0001); with
p=0.006 for U251-scrambled vs U251-shEPOR. In
agreement with these results, the inhibition of EPOR on
glioma cells greatly enhances the animal survival treated
with TMZ. In response to TMZ, the median survival of
U251-shEPOR animals is 101 days versus 61 days for
animals bearing U251-scrambled tumours (Figure 3B).
As depicted on Figure 3B, relative to untreated U251scrambled group, the survivorship is increased by 79%
for U251-scrambled TMZ group (p<0.0001), by 105% for
U251-shEPOR untreated group (p<0.0001) and by 197%
for U251-shEPOR TMZ group (p<0.0001), with p<0.0001
for U251-shEPOR TMZ group vs U251-scrambled TMZ
group (Figure 3B).

EPOR inhibition associated to radiotherapy or
chemotherapy promotes senescence and mitotic
death of glioma cells along with an increase of
polyploidy and cyclin B1 expression
To study the mechanisms of EPOR down-regulation
on radio- or chemosensitisation, we performed a flow
cytometry study for U87-scrambled and U87-shEPOR
cells following different times of treatment (from 0
to 120h) with either a single dose of X-rays (8 Gy) or

TMZ (100 µM). As soon as 14h post-treatment, ionising
radiation induce a transient accumulation of U87scrambled cells in the G2/M phase, at the expense of
cells of the G0/G1 phase (Figure 4A). This G2/M arrest is
transient and followed by a shift of the cells in G1 phase
at 24h post-radiation. When radiotherapy is combined
with EPOR inhibition, glioma cells exhibit a similar
cell proportion in the G2/M phase before and 14h after
radiation (about 50% of cells). At this post-radiation time,
a transient increase in polyploid cells is only observed
for U87-shEPOR cells (U87-shEPOR=37% and U87scrambled=13%) (Figure 4B). These results suggest
that EPOR inhibition promotes polyploidy rather than
potentiates the G2/M arrest as described for irradiated
U87-scrambled cells. Then, a progressive accumulation
of the cells in the subG1 phase is observed for the both
cell types until 72h and maintained at 120h (Figures 4A

and 4B). Of note, at 120h post-radiation, an increase in
polyploid cells seems to start for both cell types (Figure
4A), but this effect is more pronounced for U87-shEPOR
cells (Figure 4B). In response to EPOR inhibition
combined to radiation, a biphasic increase in polyploid
cells might be described in the acute phase after radiation
(14h) followed by a late phase (120h).
Concerning the chemotherapy, G2/M arrest is not as
early as observed for X-rays treatment but starts at 24h up
to 120h post-TMZ (Figure 4C). When EPOR expression is
knock-down, similar proportions of cells in G2/M phase,
G0/G1 as well as in polyploidy were observed at 48h
post-TMZ (Figure 4D). However, from 72h to 120h postTMZ, although G2/M arrest persists or tends to slowly
decline, the proportion of U87-shEPOR cells in polyploidy
strongly increases concomitantly. Unlike X-rays treatment,
for both U87-scrambled and U87-shEPOR, the proportion

Figure 3: EPOR inhibition expression on glioma cells potentiates the reduction of tumour volume and the increase of
animal survival induced by temozolomide. The orthotopic injection of U251-scrambled or U251-shEPOR cells was realised on nude
mice and tumour progression was evaluated by MRI. At equivalent brain tumour volume (30-40 mm3), animals were treated per os by TMZ
(10 mg/kg/day) during 5 consecutive days (D26-D30 for U251-scrambled and D54-D58 for U251-shEPOR). (A) Longitudinal MRI tumour

of cells in the subG1 phase is not changed 120h posttreatment with TMZ (Figures 4C and 4D).
All of these data indicate that cell cycle
perturbations observed after treatment of shEPOR-glioma
cells with radiation or TMZ are mediated by an abrogation
of G2/M checkpoint leading mainly to polyploid cells. It
suggests that the inhibition of EPOR expression might
increase the cell death induced by radio- or chemotherapy
in comparison to control cells. We next investigated the
nature of the sensitisation to chemo- and radiotherapy
induced by EPOR silencing by focusing on cell death
especially cellular senescence. As depicted on Figure 5
and according to our previous cell cycle data (Figures
1 and 4), in control conditions, inhibition of EPOR
expression increases the proportion of senescent cells
compared to U87-scrambled cells (Figure 5A). We confirm
that the X-rays exposure causes the senescence of control

cells, but this phenomenon is amplified by the inhibition
of EPOR since, proportionally, the number of blue cells
is more important in U87-shEPOR group compared to
U87-scrambled group. As described for the radiotherapy,
chemotherapy-induced senescence is potentiated by EPOR
down-regulation (Figure 5A).
In order to strengthen these results, we studied
others hallmarks of cellular senescence including the
hypermethylation of a histone H3 (trimethylK9), that is
related to senescence-associated heterochromatinization
[57–59] and the persistence of gamma-H2AX foci [60,61].
As illustrated on Figures 5B and 6A, both treatments
lead to the appearance of these senescence markers in
control glioma cells exposed to X-rays and TMZ but these
phenomena are amplified by the inhibition of EPOR. The
quantitative kinetic analysis of histone H3 (trimethylK9)
immunostaining shows that, regardless of the time after

treatment, the proportion of positive U87-shEPOR cells
is significantly higher than that of U87-scrambled cells
(Figures 5B and 5C). Furthermore, this enhancement of
histone H3 hypermethylation persists over time. Indeed,
at 168h post-radiation: 88% of U87-shEPOR cells are still
positive versus 68% for U87-scrambled cells (p<0.05) and
at 168h post-TMZ, 76% of U87-shEPOR cells are still
positive versus 54% for the U87-scrambled cells (p<0.05).
We also investigated the effects of the combined
treatments on the DNA double-strand breaks by

quantifying ɣH2AX positive cells after different times of
radiotherapy or chemotherapy (Figures 6A and 6B). A soon
as 2h post-radiation, all U87-scrambled and U87-shEPOR
cells display DNA breaks (Figure 6B). However, for later
times, for example at 168h post-radiation (Figure 6B),
a large proportion of U87-shEPOR cells (59%) are still
positive compared to U87-scrambled cells (15%, p<0.05).
Similarly, we show a persistence of ɣH2AX foci after
X-rays treatment (up to 168 hours) in the U87-shEPOR
cells, a phenomenon that is not found in U87-scrambled

cells (Figure 6B). Of note, this persistence of ɣH2AX foci,
which reflects the genomic instability and the presence
of irreversible senescence, is also observed in the U87scrambled even after 168h of TMZ treatment (Figures 6A
and 6B). However, the inhibition of EPOR amplifies this
effect. At 168h post-TMZ, 79% of U87-shEPOR cells are
still positive versus 52% for U87-scrambled cells (p<0.05)
(Figure 6B). These results are in favour of a lack of DNA
repair and might reflect a genomic instability.
One of the consequences of such genomic instability
might be analysed by the presence of micronuclei [62–64].
The micronuclei formation analysed at various times after
exposure glioma cells to radiation or TMZ (Figures 6C
and 6D) corroborates the above results. Whichever postirradiation time studied, the cell number with micronuclei
is always higher in U87-shEPOR cells than those detected
in U87-scrambled cells (Figure 6D) and at 120h and 168h
after X-rays treatment, almost all U87-shEPOR cells
display micronuclei. Similar results were obtained for
TMZ treatment (Figure 6D), with a 2.5-fold increase of
micronuclei in U87-shEPOR treated cells compared to
U87-scrambled treated cells at 168h post-treatment.
Cells in senescence may return to the cell cycle
but in most cases, they may undergo cell death via
apoptosis or mitotic death [43]. Accordingly, we next
addressed the question whether EPOR silencing might
influence these cellular processes in response to X-rays or
TMZ treatments. The increase in the subG1 populations
observed for the irradiated U87 cells suggests the presence
of apoptotic cells (Figures 4A and 4B).
Apoptosis induced by EPOR silencing is further
confirmed by the activation of caspase-3, as demonstrated
by the appearance of its cleaved active form (Figure
7A). Morphological examination of cells also reveals
the presence of some large multinucleate cells either
after X-rays and TMZ treatments or when glioma cells
were depleted in EPOR (Figure 7A), indicating that some
cells are entering a faulty mitosis without cytokinesis,
corresponding to mitotic catastrophe. We next examined
whether apoptosis or necrosis were involved in the final
death of these cells. To discriminate apoptotic and necrotic
cell death, cells showing multiple nuclei and a co-staining
for cleaved caspase-3 were scored as cells in mitotic
catastrophe committed to dying by a caspase-dependent
way. A quantification of the cells dying by caspasedependent (apoptosis-dependent mitotic death) or caspaseindependent way (necrosis-dependent mitotic death) was
performed (Figure 7B). From these results (Figures 7A and
B), and according to cell cycle data (Figure 1B), EPOR
silencing increases apoptosis of glioma cells. Indeed,
under basal conditions, compared to U87-scrambled cells,
37% of U87-shEPOR cells are in apoptosis (p<0.0001) and
4% of these cells are in mitotic death (Figure 7B). Ionising
radiation or TMZ significantly increases apoptosis as well
as in mitotic death. However, although the population
of apoptotic cells remains constant, sole the population
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

of cells entering in mitotic death is amplified when the
chemo- or radiotherapy were combined with EPOR
inhibition (Figure 7B). In particular, 2.5 to 3 time more of
U87-shEPOR cells in apoptosis-dependent mitotic death
(p<0.05) are detected compared to control cells exposed to
treatment alone (U87-scrambled cells treated with X-rays
and with TMZ, respectively). EPOR inhibition enhances
the overall glioma death in response to radiotherapy or
chemotherapy (p<0.05) relative to scrambled cells, with a
total of 83% versus 50% for irradiation, and 88% versus
67% for TMZ treatment (Figure 7B).
To strengthen the hypothesis that EPOR inhibition
potentiates the mitotic death of cells subjected to radioor chemotherapy, the levels of p53, as a major inducer
of apoptosis, and of cyclin B1, as a molecular marker
of mitotic death, were analysed by western blot 48h and
120h after treatments. Without treatment, EPOR downregulation increases by 200% the expression of the cyclin
B1 without any significant effect on p53 expression
(Figures 8A and 8B). In response to X-rays, at 48h posttreatment, the expression of p53 is strongly induced in
U87-scrambled cells compared to U87-shEPOR cells
(U87-shEPOR+X-rays=389% versus U87-scrambled+Xrays=642%, p<0.05) (Figure 8A). In agreement with the
results of cleaved caspase-3 immunostaining (Figure
7), 48h post-radiation, a robust increase in cyclin B1
expression is detected only in U87-shEPOR cells
compared to U87-scrambled cells (U87-shEPOR+Xrays=538% versus U87-scrambled+X-rays=121%, p<0.05;
Figure 8A) and importantly, this increase is sustained
at 120h after radiation exposure. Similar results are
observed for TMZ treatment (Figure 8B) with a higher
level of p53 for U87-scrambled cells only and of cyclin
B1 expression for U87-scrambled cells and U87-shEPOR
cells. However, the increase of the cyclin B1 expression
is more pronounced when chemotherapy is combined to
EPOR inhibition (U87-shEPOR+TMZ=726% versus U87scrambled+TMZ=325%, p<0.05) (Figure 8B).

DISCUSSION
Glioblastoma (GBM) remains the most aggressive
and lethal brain tumour due to its heterogeneity as well
as high motility and invasion capabilities of its cells,
resulting in high resistance to current standard treatments
(surgery, followed by ionising radiation combined
with temozolomide chemotherapy). Hypoxia, a main
characteristic of GBM, is also generally associated
with increased aggressiveness and resistance to the
conventional treatments for these tumours [4,6,65]. The
relative failure of the present treatment of GBM had
encouraged developing alternative target therapeutic
strategies such as anti-angiogenic therapies but with
limited success [66]. One way to further improve the
efficacy of conventional treatments might be to identify
genes responsible for tumour resistance. Recently, we and

others demonstrated that EPOR signalling on glioma cells,
as well as on glioma stem cells, plays an important role
in the tumour progression [19,21,22]. In this study, we
determined, in vitro, that EPOR inhibition induces a G2/M
arrest of tumour cells, consistent with our previous results
showing that EPOR knock-down slows down the glioma
growth. We also showed that EPOR silencing increases
the sensitivity of normoxic and hypoxic GBM cells to
TMZ and radiation treatments. The data presented here
suggest that EPOR knock-down reinforces the efficacy of
conventional treatments, by heightening the senescence
that induces a robust genomic instability as evidenced by
the presence of polyploid cells, the increase of cells with
micronuclei and the persistent DNA breaks. This genetic

instability combined to persistent increased of cyclin B1
expression finally leads to the caspase-dependent mitotic
cell death of glioma cells.
Until now, controversial effects of EPO on glioma
cells response to radiation or chemotherapy were reported.
For instance, in vivo studies have shown that recombinant
human EPO (rHuEPO) administration increases the
efficacy of radiotherapy by reducing anaemia and tumour
hypoxia [67,68]. In contrast, several studies indicated that
an in vitro treatment with rHuEPO induces a significant
resistance of glioma cells to ionising radiation and
drugs which depends on signalling induced by EPOR
[19,69,70]. Besides these studies with rHuEPO, our work
represents the first investigation on the impact of the

endogenous EPO/EPOR system present on glioma cells
on the efficacy of radio- and chemotherapy. Interestingly,
our results indicate that EPOR inhibition sensitises GBM
cells to treatments in normoxia and hypoxia conditions.
Interestingly, considering that hypoxia is a common
feature of GBM, the observation that EPOR knockdown counteracts the hypoxia-induced chemo- and
radioresistance is also noteworthy. These results were

confirmed on a preclinical hypoxic GBM model. In
this U251 model, EPOR silencing combined with TMZ
treatment was more efficient to delay tumour relapse and
to increase animal survival compared to TMZ alone.
We next aimed to identify the molecular and cellular
features involved in the sensitisation of X-rays and TMZ
induced by EPOR inhibition. In basal conditions, we show
that the inhibition of EPOR affects the cell cycle of glioma

cells with a G2/M arrest accompanied with an increase in
the cyclin B1 expression, an indicator of G2/M arrest but
not that of cyclin D1 expression, a critical mediator of G1
to S phase progression. In line with these results, EPOR
knock-down inhibition leads to tumour cell apoptosis
and premature senescence. These results are consistent
with those described the past few decades, regarding the
signalling pathways downstream of EPO/EPOR, which
have been shown to influence anti-apoptotic pathways
not only in erythroid cells but also in brain cells such as
neurons [71,72]. A growing line of evidence identifies
premature senescence as an important effector in response
to chemotherapeutic agents as well as radiation and
recently, it has been proposed that senescence-induced
agents, when combined with other classic therapeutic
approaches may be more effective in treatment of cancer
[73]. Accordingly, therapy-induced senescence refers
to a population of cancer cells that has been forced into
senescence state by therapeutic agents. However, since
cellular senescence might be reversible [43,74], the goal
of these new therapeutic strategies is not only to force
cancer cells to enter the senescence program but also to
promote elimination of these senescent cells. Our results
support this hypothesis. Indeed, we show that EPOR
silencing in glioma cells forces the tumour cells treated
with TMZ or ionising radiation toward senescence and
mitotic catastrophe, reducing the proliferation capacities
of glioma cells and, potentiating and prolonging the
effects of the chemo- and radiotherapy. Collectively, our
results suggest that inhibiting EPOR signalling on glioma
cells might improve the first-line treatment of GBM. The
current treatment was introduced in clinic assuming that
TMZ sensitises GBM cells to radiation. Chemotherapy
was expected not only to be a cytotoxic modality for
malignant glioma but also, by producing a cell cycle arrest
in G2/M phase, to sensitise the tumour cells to radiation
[46,75]. It has been shown that TMZ sensitises GBM cells
to radiation not through apoptosis, but through mitotic
catastrophe induction [76,77]. Thus, treatments based on
drug combinations that induce mitotic catastrophe leading
to multiple mechanisms of cell death and growth arrest,
deserve attention due to the efficacy to induce cell death.
Accordingly, our results show that EPOR silencing on
glioma cells increases the toxicity of TMZ and X-rays in
GBM cells mainly through the enhancement of senescence
leading to the induction of mitotic catastrophe.
Data of the present study argue in favor that in
combination with X-rays or TMZ, silencing EPOR on
glioma cells leads preferentially to a robust G2/M arrest
which is accompanied by a robust genomic instability as
evidenced by the presence of polyploid cells, the increase
of cells with micronuclei as well as persistent DNA breaks.
After several days of treatment, this senescence feature
and the persistent high level of cyclin B1 expression is a
scenario that produces cell death by apoptosis-dependent
mitotic death. Our results are in concordance with recent
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

studies showing a link between G2/M arrest and mitotic
catastrophe through the regulation of cyclin B1 [40,77,78].
Collectively, these results suggest that mitotic cell death
modulation strategy induced by EPOR inhibition could be
considered as a therapy-induced senescence to reinforce
the efficacy of standard treatments of GBM.
An increasing body of evidence identifies the
therapeutically resistant and invasive subpopulation
of cancer cells within GBM as tumour-initiating cells
or glioma stem cells (GSC). Recently, according to our
results, it has been proved that targeting EPOR expression
decreased GSC tumorigenic potential [21] and GSC are
known to be highly chemo- and radioresistant [79,80].
Accordingly, it could be important to evaluate whether
silencing EPOR on these GSC could also improve the
efficacy of conventional treatment on these pool of tumour
cells.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell lines
Two human glioblastoma cell lines were used: U87MG (wild-type p53, [50,81]) purchased from American
Type Culture Collections (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA)
and U251-MG (mutated p53, [50,81]) obtained from
the National Cancer Institute (NCI, Bethesda, MD,
USA). Tumour cells were cultured in DMEM (SigmaAldrich, France) supplemented with 10% foetal calf
serum (FCS) (InVitrogen, France), 2 mM glutamine
(Gln) (Sigma-Aldrich, France) and 100 U/ml penicillin/
streptomycin (PS) (InVitrogen, France). Human UT7 cells,
a megakaryoblastic leukemia cell line, were obtained from
Dr. Patrick Mayeux (Institut Cochin, Paris, France). UT7
cells were cultured in alpha-modiﬁed Eagle’s medium
(Eurobio, France) with 10% FCS, 2 mM Gln, 100 U/ml
PS and 2 IU/ml of rHuEPO (Proteogenix, France). All cell
lines were maintained in culture at 37°C with 5% CO2 and
95% humidity and replated weekly.

Hypoxia treatment
Hypoxia experiments were performed in a hypoxia
chamber (IN VIVO 2 500, Ruskinn Technology and Awel
International, France) set at 1% O2, 5% CO2 and 94% N2
at 37 °C. The culture medium was replaced by the same
medium, equilibrated for 30 min with the gas mixture
contained in the hypoxia chamber. The glioma cells were
placed in the hypoxia workstation 18 hours after cell
seeding (i.e. 6 hours before X-rays or drug treatments) and
maintained under hypoxic or normoxic conditions (5%
CO2 and 95% air at 37 °C) until the end of the experiment.

Radiation and drug treatments

SF2 (survival fraction at 2 Gy), D0 (mean lethal dose
corresponding to dose for SF=37%), SER (sensitisation
enhancement ratio determining by the ratio D0 control
cells/D0 infected cells) and OER (oxygen enhancement
ratio corresponding to the ratio D0 in hypoxia/ D0 in
normoxia).

Glioma cells were exposed at room temperature to
X-rays with doses ranging 0-8 Gy (Therac 15-Saturne with
a dose rate of 2 Gy/min). All irradiation experiments were
performed at the Radiotherapy Department of the CLCC
(Centre de Lutte Contre le Cancer) François Baclesse
(Caen, France) 24 hours after cell seeding.
Temozolomide (TMZ) prepared as a stock solution
at 160 mM and stored at -20°C, was diluted in culture
medium in presence of a concentration of DMSO (0.01%)
that did not affect cell proliferation or survival. U87 and
U251 cells were exposed to 25 µM or 100 µM TMZ which
was brought in fresh medium.

Proliferation assay
The cytotoxic effect of TMZ was evaluated by
counting the cell number 72 hours after cell treatment
in normoxic and hypoxic conditions. At the end of
the treatment, U87 and U251 cells were fixed with 4%
paraformaldehyde (PFA) (Sigma-Aldrich, France) in
phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and cell nuclei were
stained with Hoechst 33342 (10 μg/ml in PBS, SigmaAldrich, France). Photographs were acquired in a
blinded style under fluorescence (4 wells per condition;
6 photographs per well) and the cell number was counted
automatically with ImageJ (Rasband, W.S., ImageJ, U.S.
N.I.H.). Each experiment was performed in triplicate.
With the same method, a cell proliferation study was
performed to determine doubling time for each cell line
according to the formula: T = t x ln2 × [ln(N2) - ln(N1)]
with t = time between T1 and T2, N1 = the cell number
at the time T1 and N2 = the cell number at the time T2.
For all cells, the doubling time was calculated in the
exponential phase of proliferation, in particular between
days 2 and 3 after seeding.

Lentiviral infection
Stable inhibition of EPOR expression in U87 and
U251 cells was realised by RNA interference (SigmaAldrich, France). The cell infection by human EPOR
shRNA was performed as described in previous study
[22]. Control cells consisted of scrambled-shRNA infected
cells.

Clonogenic survival assay
For U251 cells, a standard clonogenic assay was
used [82]. U251 cells were plated in 6-well plates (500
cells/ml), exposed to X-rays 24 hours after the cell seeding
and kept in the incubator for duration of 10-14 days. Then,
colonies were stained with 2% crystal violet (SigmaAldrich, France) diluted in 20% ethanol. Only colonies
with more than 50 cells were counted manually. As the
U87 cells do not form colonies on plastic [83], the soft
agar assay for colony formation was used. In 6-well plates,
1 ml of top agarose solution (0.35% agarose) containing
U87 cells (5000 cells/ml) was plated on 1 ml of base agar
layer (0.5% agar). Standard medium (500 µl) is added in
order to humidify the top agarose and is changed two times
per week. U87 cells were exposed to X-rays 24 hours after
the cell seeding and kept in the incubator for the next 21
days. The colonies were stained with 0.005% crystal violet
(Sigma-Aldrich, France) diluted in 20% ethanol (SigmaAldrich, France) and counted [84]. For one experiment,
the effect of each dose of radiation was studied on three
individual wells of cell culture and each experiment was
performed in quadruplicate.
The survival curves were analysed by a least square
fit to the linear quadratic equation: SF = e-(αD + βD2)
where α and β are the linear and quadratic parameters
respectively; D corresponds to the absorbed dose and SF is
the survival fraction. From the linear quadratic equations
obtained with JMP software (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC,
USA), several radiobiological parameters were calculated:
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Cell cycle analysis
At various time points following cell exposure to
X-rays (8 Gy) or TMZ (100 µM), cell cycle of U87 cells
was studied by flow cytometry with Coulter DNA Prep
Reagents kit according to manufacturer’s instructions
(Beckman Coulter SAS, France). Propidium iodide
staining was analysed using FACSCalibur (Becton
Dickinson Biosciences, France) with 20 000 events
per determination. Analysis and determination of cell
distribution in each phase of cell cycle was performed
using the Cell Quest Pro software (Becton Dickinson
Biosciences, France).

Senescence assay
Senescence induction was determined based on
alterations in cell morphology (enlargement and flattening)
and expression of a pH-dependent β-galactosidase [29].
Senescence associated β-galactosidase staining (SA-βgal) was realised as described by Dimri et al. [85] and
according to manufacturer’s instructions (Cell Signalling
technology, USA).

system (Promega, France) (RT at 42°C for 1 h). Forward
(F) and reverse (R) primers were designed for each gene
using Beacon Designer software (Bio-Rad, France):
human EPOR: F = 5’-CCTGACGCTCTCCCTCATCC-3’

β-actin: F = 5’- GACAGGATGCAGAAGGAGATTACT3’ and R = 5’-TGATCCACATCTGCTGGAAGGT-3’.
Assays were run in duplicate on the iCycler iQ™ realtime PCR detection system (Bio-Rad, France). The
amplification profile was as follows: Hot Goldstar enzyme
activation, 95°C for 3 min; PCR 50 cycles at 95°C, 15
sec and 60°C, 1 min. The PCR was done according to the
manufacturer’s protocol using the PCR™ Core Kit Sybr™
Green I (Eurogentec, France). The results were analysed
using a comparative method between the fractional cycle

number of β-actin gene and expressed using the 2-ΔCt
formula.

Glioma cells were plated in 24-well plates on
coverslips and one day later were exposed to X-rays (8
Gy) and TMZ (100 µM). At different times following
treatments, cells were fixed with 4% PFA. Non-specific
bindings were blocked with a solution of 3% bovine
serum albumin (BSA) (Sigma-Aldrich, France)PBS-0.1% Tween (Sigma-Aldrich, France) for 1 hour at
room temperature. Then, cells were incubated overnight
at 4°C with a primary antibody. The following primary
antibodies were used: histone H3 (trimethylK9) (1/500;
Abcam, ab8898); phospho-histone H2AX (ser139) (1/200;
Cell Signalling Technology, D175, 2577S) and cleavedcaspase-3 (1/1600; Cell Signalling Technology, 9661S) in
1% BSA-PBS-0.1% Tween. The revelation was achieved
by an Alexa-555-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary
antibody (1/200; Molecular Probes, A21429). Cells were
counterstained with Hoechst 33342 (10 µg/ml; SigmaAldrich, France) for nuclear staining. A micronucleus
assay was performed from Hoechst 33342 staining and a
cell with at least a micronucleus was considered positive.
All immunocytochemical markers were observed on a
Leica DM6000 microscope with a 40X objective. For each
condition, at least 3 coverslips were analysed. Images from
3 representative high-power fields per slide were acquired.

In vivo experiments

Cells, exposed or not for 48 or 120 hours to X-rays
(8 Gy) or TMZ (100µM), were lysed with RIPA buffer
(Sigma-Aldrich, France) supplemented with 1 µg/ml
protease inhibitors (Sigma-Aldrich, France) and 1 µg/ml
phosphatase inhibitors (Sigma-Aldrich, France). Proteins
(40 µg) were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred
to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (GE Healthcare
Bio-Sciences, Sweden). The following primary antibodies
were used: EPOR (1/200; Santa Cruz, M-20, sc-697),
Cyclin D1 (1/2000; Cell Signalling Technology, DCS6,
2926S); Cyclin B1 (1/200; Santa Cruz, GNS1, sc-245) and
p53 (1/200; Santa Cruz, DO-1, sc-126). β-actin antibody
(1/5000; Sigma-Aldrich, A2066) was used to check the
equal loading in proteins on the gel. Blots were exposed
to peroxidase-linked secondary antibodies (anti-rabbit
antibody: 1/10000; Sigma-Aldrich, A0545 and antimouse antibody: 1/5000; Sigma-Aldrich, A8924) and then
the immunoreactive bands were visualised by enhanced
chemiluminescence reagents (Thermo-Scientific, France).
The band intensity of the different studied proteins
was normalised to their corresponding actin signal and
processed with ImageJ. Western blot photographs are

investigate was given to SV (14-55) in authorised housing
and laboratories (B14118001) and with the permission of
the regional committee on animal ethics (CENOMEXA,
0502-02). Mice were maintained in specific pathogen free
housing and were fed with γ-irradiated laboratory chow
and given water ad libitum (CURB, Central University of
Caen Animal Care Facility).
Animals were manipulated under deep anaesthesia
(5% isoflurane for induction, 2% for maintenance in 70%
N2O/30% O2). Body temperature was monitored and
maintained at 37.5±0.5°C with a feedback-controlled
heating pad connected to a rectal probe.
Orthotopic glioma cells implantations were realised
on male athymic nude mice (25-27 g; Charles River
laboratory, L’Arbresle, France) according to our previous
study [22].
TMZ (TemodalTM; Schering-Plough, France) was
given per os (10 mg/kg/day on 5 consecutive days) when
the tumours reached a volume of 30-40 mm3. Control
animals received saline solution per os.
For determination of tumour volume, Magnetic
Resonance Imaging (MRI) experiments were done once
a week. MRI was performed on a 7 teslas horizontal
magnet (Pharmascan, Bruker, Ettlingen). A cross coil

configuration was used (volume/surface coil, Bruker,
Ettlingen). The tumour was detected using an accelerated
T2w sequence (RARE, acceleration factor of 8; TR/
TEeff=5000/62.5 msec; number of experiments (NEX)=4;
20 contiguous slices; resolution=0.15x0.15x0.50 mm3;
acquisition time=8 min). Tumour volumes were delineated
manually with ImageJ.
