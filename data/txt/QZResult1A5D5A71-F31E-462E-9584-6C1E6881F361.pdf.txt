ABSTRACT
The current standard of care for lung cancer consists of concurrent
chemotherapy and radiation. Several studies have shown that the DNA-PKcs
inhibitor NU7441 is a highly potent radiosensitizer, however, the mechanism of
NU7441’s anti-proliferation effect has not been fully elucidated. In this study, the
combined effect of NU7441 and ionizing radiation (IR) in a panel of non-small cell
lung cancer cell lines (A549, H460 and H1299) has been investigated. We found that
NU7441 significantly enhances the effect of IR in all cell lines. The notable findings
in response to this combined treatment are (i) prolonged delay in IR-induced DNA
DSB repair, (ii) induced robust G2/M checkpoint, (iii) increased aberrant mitosis
followed by mitotic catastrophe specifically in H1299, (iv) dramatically induced
autophagy in A549 and (v) IR-induced senescence specifically in H460. H1299 cells
show greater G2 checkpoint adaptation after combined treatment, which can be
attributed to higher expression level of Plk1 compared to A549 and H460. The
enhanced autophagy after NU7441 treatment in A549 is possibly due to the higher
endogenous expression of pS6K compared to H1299 and H460 cells. In conclusion,
choice of cell death pathway is dependent on the mutation status and other genetic
factors of the cells treated.

to increase radiosensitivity is an essential strategy in the
treatment of NSCLC.
DNA-PKcs is an essential component in the nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) pathway of doublestranded DNA break (DSB) repair [4]. In response to
DNA DSBs, DNA-PKcs is rapidly recruited to damage
sites by the Ku70/Ku80 heterodimer and phosphorylated
at Thr2609 and Ser2056 clusters by ATM and itself,
respectively [5, 6]. The recruitment and phosphorylation

INTRODUCTION
Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is one of
the most commonly diagnosed cancers and the leading
cause of cancer-related death worldwide [1]. Current
standard of care consists of concurrent chemotherapy
and radiation but overall survival rates remain dismal
in all but earliest stages of treatment [2, 3]. Therefore,

of DNA-PKcs contributes to processing and direct ligation
of broken DNA ends. In addition to its role in DNA DSB
repair, DNA-PKcs also participates in DNA DSB-induced
G2/M cell cycle checkpoint regulation and apoptosis
[7, 8]. Several studies have demonstrated the elevation
of mRNA and protein levels of DNA-PKcs in NSCLC
[9–11], and, furthermore, the elevation of DNA-PKcs is
correlated with radioresistance in some advanced stage
cancers [11]. Therefore, targeting of DNA-PKcs is an
attractive approach to enhance radiosensitivity in NSCLC.
Based upon its important role in the NHEJ repair pathway,
different anti-DNA-PKcs strategies have been explored to
enhance sensitivity to radiation or DNA damage-based
agents. A series of small-molecule ATP-competitive
inhibitors of DNA-PKcs have been developed. Among
these, NU7441 is the most potent and specific inhibitor of
DNA-PKcs with a half maximal inhibitory concentration
(IC50) of 14 nM against DNA-PKcs relative to other
members of the PI3KK family (ATM and ATR) in a cellfree system [12]. Several studies have shown that NU7441
has potential value to enhance the radiosensitivity in
different tumors, including colon cancer [13], breast
cancer [14] and prostate cancer (PCa) [15]. Our previous
data showed that NU7441 dramatically increased radiation
sensitivity of highly aggressive and radiation resistant PCa
cell lines [16].
In addition to inhibiting DSB repair, disturbing
cell cycle checkpoint regulation, and inducing
apoptosis, DNA-PKcs inhibition also promotes IRinduced cell killing through nonapoptotic responses,
including mitotic catastrophe [17], senescence [18] and
autophagic cell death [19]. Recent studies have shown
that DNA-PKcs inhibits IR-induced mitotic catastrophe
via promoting Chk2 activation, and consequently, that
depletion of DNA-PKcs results in increased polyploidy
and multipolar spindles after irradiation [17]. Azad et
al demonstrated that inhibition of DNA-PKcs induces
an accelerated senescence phenotype in irradiated
human NSCLC [18]. Furthermore, depletion of DNAPKcs radiosensitizes glioma-initiating cells due to
IR-induced autophagic cell death which indicates
DNA-PKcs involvement in autophagy progression
[19]. We previously reported that inhibition of DNAPKcs by NU7441 dramatically increased IR-induced
autophagy in PCa cells [16]. However, how DNA-PKcs
coordinates these different types of cell death pathways
has not been well studied. Herein, to elucidate the
cellular and molecular outcomes of inhibiting DNAPKcs by NU7441 in irradiated NSCLC we studied the
induction of apoptosis, mitotic catastrophe, autophagy
and senescence in H460, A549 and H1299 cells. Our
studies showed that NU7441 specifically radiosensitizes
H460, A549 and H1299 cells through senescence,
autophagy and mitotic catastrophe, respectively, and that
the cell death pathway choice relies on the genotypic
background of the tumor itself.

NU7441 sensitizes NSCLC cells to irradiation
To determine the effect of NU7441 on the
radiosensitivity of NSCLC cells H460, A549 and H1299
cells were exposed to IR or NU7441 + IR. As shown
in Figure 1A–1C, NU7441 can inhibit the IR-induced
DNA-PKcs phosphorylation at its Ser2056 site which
represents DNA-PKcs activation, but has no impact on
the protein amount in all of these three cell lines. Using
colony survival assay, we found that NU7441 significantly
radiosensitized NSCLC cells. The surviving fraction
(SF) at 2Gy (SF2) for H460, A549 and H1299 cells was
reduced from 0.54 ± 0.04, 0.80 ± 0.04 and 0.67 ± 0.10,
respectively, to 0.35 ± 0.03, 0.35 ± 0.07 and 0.07 ± 0.002
when we exposed the cells to 1 μM NU7441, and to 0.08
± 0.01, 0.05 ± 0.01 and 0.03 ± 0.01when we treated with
2 μM NU7441, suggesting the radiation sensitizing effect
of NU7441 is dose dependent (Figure 1D, 1E and 1F). To
further analyze the efficacy of NU7441 as a radiosensitizer
in vivo, tumor growth delay assays were performed (Figure
1G–1I). All three cell lines were implanted subcutaneously
in athymic nude mice and allowed to form tumors and then
treated with NU7441, radiation (IR), or IR + NU7441 as
mentioned in the methods. We used relative tumor volume
(RTV) as a measurement of treatment efficacy. Table 1
describes the days needed to reach a specific RTV for each
tumor line. Growth delay (GD) was measured for each
treatment to calculate a dose enhancement factor (DEF).
We report a significant DEF of 1.7 and 1.6 in H460 and
H1299 tumors respectively, whereas a modest DEF of 1.3
was observed in A549 tumors.

NU7441 blocks IR-induced DNA DSB repair in
NSCLC
The rate of DNA DSB formation and subsequent
rate of repair largely determine the efficacy of
radiation therapy. To determine whether the increased
radiosensitivity of cell lines after treatment with NU7441
was a product of compromised break repair, we subjected
the cells to immunofluorescence staining for γH2AX
(red). As shown in Figure 2A, 2C and 2E, IR-induced
DNA damage could be observed within 30 minutes in all
cell lines. In IR-only treated cells, most DNA DSB foci
were repaired at 24 hours, whereas a dramatic number of
γH2AX foci remained at 24 hours in NU7441 + IR treated
cells (Figure 2B, 2D and 2F).

NU7441 prolongs G2/M arrest in NSCLC but
specifically leads to checkpoint abrogation and
mitotic catastrophe in H1299 cells
In response to IR, mammalian cells activate the
cell cycle checkpoint which helps prevent cell division

and provides necessary time for DNA damage repair. The
effect of NU7441 on cell cycle distribution was analyzed
by flow cytometry. As shown in Figure 3A, 3B and 3C,
NU7441 induced a robust G2/M arrest from 6 to 24
hours after IR treatment in all cell lines. Moreover, the
percentage of S phase cells was significantly decreased
in H460 and A549, whereas H1299 cells had a relatively

higher proportion S phase cells, suggesting H1299 cells
may have a loose cell cycle checkpoint control system.
To further distinguish mitotic cells from the G2/M group,
flow cytometric analysis of histone H3 phosphorylation
was performed. We found that NU7441 blocks H460
and A549 cells from entering M phase 24 hours after IR
treatment. Interestingly, NU7441 treatment significantly

increased mitotic arrest in H1299 cells (10%) (Figure 3D,
3E and 3F). As H1299 had the most DNA DSBs when
compared to H460 and A549 cells, we speculate that
NU7441 abrogates G2 arrest and enhances the DNAdamaging effects of radiation in H1299 cells.
If cells escape from G2 arrest without completion
of DNA repair and enter mitosis, cells likely will undergo
mitotic arrest and then mitotic catastrophe (MC). Therefore,
we then investigated mitotic catastrophe in NU7441 treated
H1299 cells. As shown in Figure 4A and 4B, the structure of
mitotic spindles was visualized by staining with antibodies
against α-tubulin and CREST. Misaligned chromosomes
and asymmetrical multipolar spindles were dramatically
increased in NU7441 treated cells 24 hours after irradiation.
This data supports the idea that NU7441 can specifically
radiosensitize H1299 cells to IR through MC.
p53 can prevent cells from going into cell cycle
progression with damaged DNA. However, siRNAmediated p53 knockdown A549 cells didn’t lead to G2
checkpoint abrogation, suggesting p53 deficiency in H1299
cells is not essential for NU7441 induced G2 checkpoint
abrogation in this cell line (data not shown). The ATMChk2 signal pathway plays an essential role in DSB or
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

IR-induced G2 checkpoint activation. We found that IRinduced phosphorylation of ATM S1981 was increased in
NU7441-treated cells indicating NU7441 treatment leads
to more severe DNA damage, which is consistent with the
DNA DSB repair kinetics data in Figure 2. Interestingly,
ATM mediated Chk2 phosphorylation at T68 (Chk2 pT68)
has peaks at 2 and 24 hours after IR treatment. As shown
in Figure 4C, the T68-phosphorylated form of Chk2 at 24
hours is remarkably reduced in NU7441-treated H460,
A549 and H1299 cells. In contrast, the Chk2 pT68 is
dramatically increased in NU7441-treated H460 and
A549, but not H1299 cells at 2 hours. Moreover, our study
reveals that Plk1, which is involved in the process of IRinduced G2 checkpoint adaptation [20], is overexpressed
in H1299 cells. Based upon these results, we hypothesize
that Plk1 overexpression impairs the IR-induced G2
checkpoint and then leads to mitotic catastrophe in cancer
cells in the presence of NU7441. Mitotic catastrophe is
strongly associated with apoptosis. We further analyzed
IR- and NU7441-induced apoptosis in these three cell
lines. Cells were fixed and stained with cleaved-caspase3
(red) and DAPI (blue) 24 hours after NU7441 and/or IR
treatment. As shown in Figure 5A, significant apoptosis

treatments. (D–F) The mitotic index was measured by flow cytometric analysis using PI staining for DNA content and anti–phospho-Histone

(cleaved-caspase 3 positive) can only be observed in
H1299 cells after combined treatment of IR + NU7441
after 24 hours (6.7%) (Figure 5B), which is consistent with
its high level of mitotic catastrophe. To further characterize
apoptotic events, a Western blot was performed to detect
cleaved PARP-1 (Figure 5C). We noticed that PARP-1
cleavage is greater (lane 12) in H1299 cells compared
to H460 and A549 cells 24 hours after IR + NU7441
exposure. These results support mitotic catastrophe as the
predominant cause of apoptosis in H1299 cells.

As shown in Figure 6A and 6B, little or no significant
autophagy events were noticed after IR or NU7441
treatment alone in A549 and H1299 cells, only H460 cells
showed significant autophagy after irradiation. However,
all three cell lines exhibited increased autophagy with
combined treatment of IR + NU7441. Moreover, A549
cells showed significant autophagy (66.9%) when exposed
to IR + NU7441 for 72 hours, whereas H460 and H1299
cells showed only 49.9% and 38.0% at the same time point
(Figure 6B). To further explore the role of NU7441 in the
autophagy response, we looked at the activation of the
mTOR-S6K signal pathway, which is strongly correlated
with cellular autophagy. Interestingly, neither NU7441
alone nor NU7441 plus radiation affected phosphorylation
of mTOR; however, IR + NU7441 treatment significantly
inhibited phosphorylation of S6K (Figure 6C), indicating
there are some mTOR-independent S6K mechanisms
involved in NU7441-related autophagy regulation.
Consistent with AVO staining results, A549 cells showed
the strongest expression of phosphorylated S6K compared
with H460 and H1299, and NU7441 almost totally
inhibited S6K phosphorylation. These results suggest that
S6K overactivated cells may exhibit more sensitivity to an
autophagy inducer, such as NU7441.

NU7441 treatment accelerates autophagy in
irradiated NSCLC
Continuously accumulating data has suggested
that radiation induces autophagy in a variety of cancer
cells independent of apoptosis [21, 22]. Our previous
study showed that NU7441 promotes radiation-induced
autophagy in prostate cancer cells. Here we try to compare
the autophagy responses in H460, A549 and H1299 cells
when treated with IR or/and NU7441. The formation
of acidic vesicular organelles (AVOs) is one of the
characteristics of autophagy. Therefore, we analyzed the
formation of AVOs using AO staining with flow cytometry.

NU7441 specifically promotes senescence in
irradiated H460 cells

H460 cells (Figure 7C). Several studies have revealed that
p53-p21 also plays a pivotal role in autophagy, however the
mechanism by which p53-p21 regulates the pathway choice
between autophagy and senescence is still an unanswered
question that is currently under investigation.

Recent work has shown that treatment with BEZ235,
a double inhibitor of DNA-PKcs and mTOR, radiosensitizes
A549 and H460 cells through accelerated senescence.
Hence, we investigated the effect of NU7441 on the IRinduced senescence phenotype in all of these cell lines.
Senescence-associated beta-galactosidase (SA-β-gal)
activity was examined using SA-β-gal staining. As shown
in Figure 7A–7B, NU7441 + IR treatment leads to a marked
increase of senescence in H460 cells (17.8%) compared
with A549 (4.2%) and H1299 (1.8%) cells. Because the
p53-p21 pathway plays an essential role in DNA damageinduced senescence, we therefore measured the protein
expression of this signal pathway and found that IR activates
the p53-p21 pathway in both A549 and H460 cells but not
in p53-deficient H1299 cells, and that NU7441 treatment
further promotes p53 and p21 accumulation in A549 and

DISCUSSION
Radiotherapy is an effective strategy for the
treatment of non-small cell lung cancer but several lung
cancer cell lines display significant radiation resistance
that limits the success of radiotherapy in advanced lung
cancer [23]. Therefore, it is imperative to develop novel
treatment strategies to enhance radiotherapy efficacy and
improve the prognosis of NSCLC. Here, we investigated
the therapeutic potential of NU7441, a novel specific
inhibitor of DNA-PKcs, in H460 (K-Ras mutation),
A549 (K-Ras mutation) and H1299 (N-Ras mutation

and p53 null) NSCLC cells. We observed significantly
enhanced cell killing in all NSCLC cells when exposed
to the combination of radiation and NU7441 both in vitro
and in vivo. DNA-PKcs is activated upon recruitment
and association with the Ku70/80 heterodimer at DSB
sites, and that kinase activity is essential for the NHEJ
pathway, the predominant mechanism to repair IR-induced
DSBs in mammals [24]. It was reported previously that
the expression of a kinase-dead mutant DNA-PKcs
results in severe defects in DSB repair and clonogenic
survival against IR [25]. Although the requirement of
DNA-PKcs kinase for the NHEJ pathway is not fully
elucidated, DNA-PKcs is known to phosphorylate many
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

downstream effectors of the NHEJ pathway as well as
additional factors continuously being identified [24]. The
development of various DNA-PKcs kinase inhibitors and
their efficacy in blocking DSB repair further highlights the
critical function of DNA-PKcs and indicates a therapeutic
target for improving radiotherapy in cancer treatment [10].
Recently, several studies revealed that inhibition
of DNA-PKcs promotes IR-induced cell killing via
multiple cell death pathways, including programmed
cell death [7, 8], mitotic catastrophe [17], autophagy
[19] and senescence [18]. To clarify how DNA-PKcs
coordinates different cell death pathways after irradiation,
we analyzed these cell death responses in H460, A549 and

H1299 NSCLC cell lines when treated with NU7441 and/
or IR. Mitotic catastrophe is the main mode of cell death
following treatment with ionizing radiation and is defined
as an aberrant form of mitosis associated with prolonged
mitotic arrest and various morphological changes [26, 27].
Consistent with previous reports, treatment with
NU7441 resulted in robust G2/M arrest 24 hours after
irradiation in all three NSCLC cell lines used in this study.
Interestingly, when we further separated G2 and M phases
using anti-pH3-Ser10 antibodies, mitotic arrest was only
found in H1299 cells after treatment with NU7441 (Figure 3).
The G2 checkpoint stops cells from progressing into
mitosis and allows the DNA repair machinery time to fix
lesions. However, when the G2 checkpoint is weakened
cells cannot maintain prolonged cell cycle arrest and
enter mitosis before DNA damage is repaired [28].
The premature entry into mitosis with unrepaired DNA
disturbs the mitotic kinetochore-microtubule structure
and leads to mitotic arrest due to spindle checkpoint
activation [29]. We found a higher incidence of aberrant
mitotic spindle structures after combined treatment with
NU7441 and IR in H1299 cells. Altogether, our data
demonstrates that NU7441 treatment leads to increased
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

mitotic catastrophe specifically in H1299 cells, indicating
dysregulation of the G2 checkpoint in H1299 cells, either
due to weakened checkpoint machinery or enhanced
checkpoint recovery due to Plk1 overexpression. Chk2
is an important kinase involved in G2 checkpoint
maintenance [30]. In response to irradiation, ATM
phosphorylates Chk2 at its Thr68 residue promoting
Chk2 dimerization and full activation [30]. Additionally,
Chk2 is also a target of DNA-PKcs after irradiation and
DNA-PKcs-Chk2 activation inhibits IR-induced mitotic
catastrophe [17]. Recently, several studies demonstrated
that phosphorylation of Chk2 T68 participates in
mitotic spindle assembly and microtubule organization,
and that DNA-PKcs is responsible for mitotic Chk2
T68 phosphorylation [31]. Here, we found that the
phosphorylation of Chk2 at Thr68 is more robust 2 hours
after irradiation in NU7441-treated H460 and A549 cells
when compared to IR alone. However, NU7441 treatment
significantly inhibits Chk2 pT68 at a later time point after
irradiation in all three of these cell lines. Based upon this
data, we speculate that the activation of Chk2 at 2 hours
after IR represents its function at the G2 checkpoint,
whereas, the phosphorylation of Chk2 at later time points

correlates with its role in mitosis regulation, which is
dependent on the DNA-PKcs kinase and is attenuated in
the presence of NU7441. Plk1 is an essential kinase for
mitotic progression [32, 33] that is overexpressed in many
cancers, including NSCLC [34]. Besides its function in
normal mitotic progression, Plk1 plays a crucial role in
DNA damage-induced G2 checkpoint recovery [35].
Activation of Plk1 is correlated with G2 checkpoint
abrogation [20]. Van Vugt et al demonstrated that Plk1
blocks Chk2 activation even in the presence of active
ATM during mitosis [36]. In this study, we identified
that Plk1 is overexpressed in H1299 cells compared with
H460 and A549, indicating that Plk1 may partially impair
radiation-induced G2 checkpoint via disturbing Chk2
phosphorylation in H1299 cells. Overexpression of Plk1
may further sensitize cells to combined NU7441 and IR
treatment through mitotic catastrophe. We speculate that
the expression level of Plk1 might play an important role
in determining the choice between mitotic catastrophe and
other cell death pathways. Recent studies support the idea
that mitotic catastrophe is a subtype of apoptosis induced
by a combination of defective cell cycle checkpoints
and persistent DNA damage [37, 38]. Consistent with
these reports, our study revealed that NU7441 treatment
significantly enhanced IR-induced apoptosis in H1299
cells, whereas only a very low percentage of apoptotic
cells were detected in the other two cell lines.

Autophagy is a lysosomal degradation pathway
that eliminates damage or potentially dangerous proteins
and organelles under adverse conditions to protect cells
from metabolic stress [39]. However, previous studies
have suggested that autophagy also functions as a prodeath mechanism that is frequently activated in tumor
cells treated with chemotherapy or radiotherapy [40,
41]. Previous studies have demonstrated that DNAPKcs activation is involved in the cellular decision to
undergo apoptosis or autophagy. Loss or inactivation of
DNA-PKcs causes autophagic cell death in malignant
gliomas after low-dose irradiation [19]. We found that
combined treatment with NU7441 + IR dramatically
induced autophagy in NSCLC cells especially in A549
cells (66.9%). Western blot analysis showed that DNAPKcs suppression markedly decreased the phosphorylation
of p70S6K at its Thr387 site but did not affect mTOR
phosphorylation. The p70S6k-mediated phosphorylation
of S6 protein, a component of eukaryotic ribosomal 40S
subunit, is important for protein translation and ribosome
formation [42]. On the basis of the experiments with rat
hepatocytes, p70S6K is a negative regulator of autophagy
[43, 44]. Here, we found that the phosphorylation level
of p70S6K is dramatically higher in A549 cells compared
to H460 and H1299. Therefore, we speculate that
phosphorylation of p706K may be a molecular marker
to predict sensitivity of autophagy induction. More

interestingly, other mTOR-independent pathways must
exist in order to explain the phenomenon that DNA-PKcs
inhibition has no effect on mTOR phosphorylation. It has
been reported that phosphoinositide-dependent kinase
(PDK1) can phosphorylate and activate p70 S6K [44,
45]. Moreover, the PDK1 signal pathway is correlated
with DNA-PKcs activation after irradiation through
coordinating PKB/Akt phosphorylation [46]. The crosstalk
between PDK1 and DNA-PKcs with respect to IR-related
autophagy will require further investigation.
Direct DNA damage, caused by either radiation or
DNA-damage agents, can induce cell senescence [47].
Defects in DSB repair have been correlated to senescence
phenotype. Knockout of Xrcc4, DNA ligase IV, Ku86,
Brca1 and other DNA repair-related genes induces
premature senescence of MEFs and results in an aging
phenotype in mice [48]. In this study, we revealed that
NU7441 can significantly accelerate IR-induced cellular
senescence in H460 cells but only little senescence was
observed in A549 and H1299 cells. The p53-p21 signal
pathway plays a pivotal role in mediating DNA damageinduced senescence. Hence, H1299 has little senescence
because of its p53-deficient status. However, IR and IR +
NU7441 combined treatment leads to increased expression
of p53 and p21 in both H460 and A549 cells. It is not
clear how cells choose between cell senescence (H460)
and autophagy (A549) in response to DNA damage.
Even though the protein amount was similar between
A549 and H460 cells, we cannot exclude the possibility
that different post-translational modifications of p53 and
its different partners might exist in these two cell lines
which could lead to the activation of different sets of
transcriptional targets and subsequently determine cell
death pathway choice. Several recent studies demonstrated
that autophagy and senescence tend to occur in parallel
and that autophagy enhances the senescent phenotype
[49, 50]. On the basis of these reports, we hypothesized
that autophagy might also be a primary molecular event
and a driver of senescence after IR + NU7441 treatment.
The phenotypes of senescence and autophagy that have
been observed in H460 and A549 cells respectively may
represent different stages of cell death progression.
We also looked at the possible lung toxicity that
may occur during the combined treatment of radiation
and NU7441 in animal models. Since athymic nude mice
are deficient in immune response, we used an immune
competent mouse strain (C3H/HeJCr). For this study
we used a single fraction of 6 Gy or 10 Gy +/− NU7441
targeted to the left lung using an image guided irradiator
(X-Rad 320) with a 3.5 mm collimator. After 60 days,
lungs were fixed by tracheal instillation of 10% neutral
buffered formalin and histopathologic examinations were
performed using H & E staining. We did not observe any
pneumonitis at these time points after treatment with
radiation and NU7441. We noticed minor fibrosis only
after 60 days in mice treated with s single fraction of 10
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Gy, 6 Gy + NU7441 and 10 Gy + NU7441 as indicated in
the figure (Supplementary Figure 1).
In conclusion, this preclinical study clearly shows
that NU7441 can be administered with IR to improve
the efficacy of radiation therapy in NSCLC cells. More
importantly, our work has demonstrated that NU7441 + IR
treatment can induce different cell death events, including
mitotic catastrophe, apoptosis, autophagy and senescence.
Lastly, and most interestingly, cell death pathway choice
may be dependent on the genetic milieu of cancer cells
implying that NU7441 can be an important part of a
personalized treatment strategy.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture and treatment
The human NSCLC cell lines H460, A549 and
H1299 were kindly provided by Dr. John D. Minna at
University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas,
TX, and grown in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% FBS
(HyClone, Hudson, NH, USA) at 37°C with 5% CO2.
Cells were treated with ionizing radiation using a MarkII Cesium-137 irradiator (J L Shepherd and Associates)
at a dose rate of 3.47 Gy/min at room temperature with
or without a 1 hour pretreatment with NU7441 (Tocris
Bioscience, Ellisville, Mo, USA).

Immunoblotting and antibodies
Whole-cell lysate preparation and western blotting
were performed as previously described [51]. For
immunofluorescent staining, cells were grown on polyD-lysine-coated culture slides (BD Pharmingen, San
Diego, CA, USA), washed in phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS), fixed in PBS containing 4% paraformaldehyde,
permeabilized in 0.5% Triton X-100 and blocked in
PBS containing 5% bovine serum albumin. The cells
were incubated with indicated primary antibodies for 2
h at room temperature, washed with PBS and incubated
with Alexa-568- and Alexa-488- conjugated secondary
antibodies for 1 h (Invitrogen). Cells were then washed
with PBS and mounted in Vectashield mounting medium
with 4,6- diamidino-2-phenylindole (Vector Laboratories,
Burlingame, CA, USA). Images were acquired from a
Zeiss AxioImager M2 microscope system equipped with
a Plan-Apochromat 63/NA 1.40 objective, an AxioCam
MRm CCD camera and AxioVision software (Carl Zeiss,
Oberkochen, Germany). Anti-phospho-histone γH2AX
(Ser139) was purchased from EMD Millipore. Mammalian
target of rapamycin (mTOR), phosphor-mTOR (pmTOR,
S2448), phospho-S6 kinase (pS6K, T389), Plk1, ATM,
phospho-ATM (pATM, S1981), Chk2, phosphorChk2 (pChk2, T68), p53, p21 and poly (ADP-ribose)
polymerase (PARP) antibodies were purchased from

Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA). Anti-actin
antibody was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St Louis,
MO). Fluorescent dye-conjugated secondary antibodies
were obtained from Invitrogen. Antibodies against total
and phosphorylated forms of DNA-PKcs were described
previously [4, 5].

treated with NU7441 (25 mg/kg/day for 5 days, by IP),
with radiation (2 Gy/day, 5 days), and those that received
combined treatment with NU7441 and IR. NU7441 was
administered 1 h before radiation. Tumor growth delay
and the dose enhancement factor were then determined
[51]. Relative Tumor Volume (RTV) was determined
by the ratio of the tumor volume at the indicated day
divided by the tumor volume on the 1st day of treatment
prior to treatment. All experiments were conducted under
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of UTSW
approved guidelines for animal welfare. The data are
presented as the means ± SEM.

Clonogenic survival assay
Clonogenic survival experiments were performed as
previously described [51].

Cell cycle analysis

Statistical analysis

After washing twice with PBS solution, the
treatment or control cells were collected and fixed using
75% ethanol at −20°C for at least 24 hours. The cells were
resuspended with PBS and incubated with 20 μl 1 mg/ml
RNase A (Sigma, St Louis, MO) for 30 min at 37°C, and
stained with 25 μg ml/ml propidium iodide (Sigma) for 30
min at room temperature. The cell cycle distribution was
determined using flow cytometry, and more than 10,000
cells per sample were counted.

Data is presented as the mean ± SD of at least three
independent experiments. The results were tested for
significance using the unpaired Student’s t test.

Detection of acidic vesicular organelles
The cells were grown in 6-well plates and allowed
to attach overnight. The cells were incubated with 1 μg/
ml acridine orange/PBS for 15 min, washed with PBS,
and examined under a LSM 510 laser-scanning confocal
microscope (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) at × 63
magnification 72 hours after irradiation or/and NU7441
treatment. Untreated cells were also cultured for 72 hours
as a negative control. The samples were collected for
FACScan and analyzed using Flowjo 8.7.1 (Tree Star, Inc,
Ashland, OR) software to quantify cells that were positive
for acidic vesicular organelles (AVOs).
