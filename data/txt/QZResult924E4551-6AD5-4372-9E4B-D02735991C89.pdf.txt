Abstract
Oncomirs are microRNAs (miRNA) that acts as oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes. Efﬁcient identiﬁcation of
oncomirs remains a challenge. Here we report a novel, clinically guided genetic screening approach for the
identiﬁcation of oncomirs, identifying mir-30d through this strategy. mir-30d regulates tumor cell proliferation,
apoptosis, senescence, and migration. The chromosomal locus harboring mir-30d was ampliﬁed in more than
30% of multiple types of human solid tumors (n ¼ 1,283). Importantly, higher levels of mir-30d expression were
associated signiﬁcantly with poor clinical outcomes in ovarian cancer patients (n ¼ 330, P ¼ 0.0016). Mechanistic
investigations suggested that mir-30d regulates a large number of cancer-associated genes, including the
apoptotic caspase CASP3. The guided genetic screening approach validated by this study offers a powerful tool
to identify oncomirs that may have utility as biomarkers or targets for drug development. Cancer Res; 72(1);

Introduction
Cancer is a genetic disease involving multistep changes in
the genome (1). Most studies to date have focused mainly on
the role of protein-coding sequences in cancer. Although
noncoding sequences constitute up to 98% of the human
genome and have been implicated in tumorigenesis, our
knowledge of the function of these genomic sequences in
cancer is still limited (2–7). MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are noncoding RNAs about 22 nucleotides in length, which regulate gene
expression in a sequence-speciﬁc manner (2–4, 6, 8–13).

Increasing evidence indicates that miRNAs may play a
critical role in cancer (14–21). miRNAs act as key regulators
of various fundamental biological processes, many of which
share common pathways with the development of cancer. In
addition, it has been widely reported that miRNA expression
is remarkably deregulated in cancer. Several miRNAs have
already been shown to play a critical role in cancer. Referred
to as "oncomirs," these miRNAs can act as either tumor
suppressors or as oncogenes (4). Current rapid advances in
oligonucleotide/nanoparticle therapies create a realistic
optimism for the establishment of miRNAs as a new and
potent therapeutic target for cancer treatment (22–25).
However, the efﬁcient identiﬁcation of oncomirs remains
a challenge. Although both microarray based high-throughput genomic/genetic proﬁling (3, 18, 19, 26) and whole
genome-wide genetic screening (16, 27–31) have been successfully applied to the identiﬁcation of oncomirs in human
cancer, both approaches have limitations. Genome-wide
screening is time and labor intensive and, most importantly,
can produce artifacts. The proﬁling strategies cannot distinguish "causal" from "bystander" genetic events. In this
study, we report a novel, clinically guided genetic screening
approach to identify oncomirs involved human cancer. On
the basis of this approach, one promising oncomir candidate, mir-30d, was successfully identiﬁed.

Results
A clinically guided genetic screening approach to
identify oncomirs
We hypothesized that the limitations of the approaches
discussed above could be overcome by integrating these 2
approaches, that is, using miRNA array proﬁling as a "clinical/biological" ﬁlter to generate a restricted/selected
miRNA expression library, which could then be used for
functional genetic screening. To test our hypothesis, we
generated a restricted miRNA expression library as follows:
(i) We used array-based comparative genomic hybridization
(aCGH) proﬁles as the "clinical/biological" ﬁlter. miRNAs
that are highly ampliﬁed in human cancer were selected on
the basis of our previous aCGH studies (32). In ovarian
(n ¼ 109) and breast (n ¼ 73) cancer specimens, 55 and
166 miRNAs were identiﬁed, respectively, with DNA copy
number ampliﬁcation observed in more than 15% of cases
(Fig. 1A; Supplementary Table S1). (ii) These potential
oncomirs were further concentrated by combining the miRNAs that were coampliﬁed in both ovarian and breast
tumors (n ¼ 41; Fig. 1B; Supplementary Table S1). (iii) We
used a whole genome human miRNA expression library (27)
to derive this restricted library by selecting retrovirus
miRNA expression vectors for these 41 miRNAs. This
restricted library was used in an ovarian cancer cell line,
2008, to screen in vitro for miRNAs that are advantageous for
cell growth in long-term culture. This was done using a
modiﬁcation of a previously described whole genome-wide
short hairpin RNA screening method (refs. 35, 36; Fig. 1C).
Brieﬂy, target cell populations were infected such that each
cell contained, on average, a single integrated virus (27).
After 72 hours, the cells were antibiotic selected, then
propagated for 5 weeks to expand those cell clones with a
growth advantage and seeded again at low density in 150-cm
culture dishes to isolate single cell colonies. Large and

aggressively growing single colonies were collected and
expanded in 6-well plates. DNA was extracted from more
than 100 colonies and virus insertions were ampliﬁed by PCR
and conﬁrmed by DNA sequencing (Fig. 1C).
mir-30d regulates cancer cell proliferation, senescence,
and apoptosis in vitro
Several potential candidate oncomirs, including mir-30d,
were identiﬁed by the above approach. mir-30d represented
42% of the viral insertions sequenced. To validate and
further characterize this ﬁnding, we ﬁrst transfected a
chemically synthesized mir-30d mimic into 6 cancer cell
lines, including 2008, and 5 independent cancer cell lines.
Using an MTT assay, we found that forced mir-30d expression signiﬁcantly increased cell growth in all 6 cell lines (Fig.
2A). Meanwhile, a similar experiment was done using a
lentiviral mir-30d inhibitor. Consistent with our gain-offunction studies, blocking of endogenous mir-30d expression
even more remarkably decreased the growth rates of cancer
cell lines in vitro (Fig. 2B). In 2008, MDA-MB-231 and
HCT116, mir-30d inhibitor nearly completely blocked cell
growth ability in vitro (Fig. 2B). In both mimic and inhibitor
experiments, total RNA was isolated from parallel transfection wells, and real-time RT-PCR was used to conﬁrm the
effect on mir-30d expression. Because blocking endogenous
mir-30d signiﬁcantly reduced tumor cell proliferation, we
next examined the effect of mir-30d inhibitor treatment on
the cell cycle, using DNA staining followed by ﬂow cytometry. We found that mir-30d inhibitor transfection led to a
signiﬁcant cell-cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase (Fig. 2C).
Finally, we observed that transfection of a mir-30d inhibitor
not only signiﬁcantly blocked cancer cell proliferation (Fig.
2B) but also remarkably increased the number of the cells
with typical senescence morphology (Fig. 2D). To conﬁrm
this observation, we examined b-galactosidase activity, a
known characteristic of senescent cells that is not found in

presenescent, quiescent, or immortal cells. Four to 6 days
after transfection with a mir-30d inhibitor, the percentage of
b-galactosidase–positive cancer cells was signiﬁcantly
increased compared with controls (Fig. 2E).
Most recent studies have suggested that the mir-30 family
regulates apoptosis in cardiomyocytes (37) and cancer cells
(30). It indicates that decreasing of cell death may be another
mechanism to explain the advantage of mir-30d for cell growth
in long-term culture (about 2 months selection in our genetic
screening approach). Thus, we examined whether mir-30d
regulated apoptosis in the cell lines used in this study. On the
basis of a bioluminescent caspase assay, we found that transfection of a mir-30d mimic signiﬁcantly reduced caspase-3
activity in camptothecin-induced apoptosis in cancer cells

www.aacrjournals.org

(Fig. 3A). This result was further conﬁrmed via Western
blot. Figure 3B shows that the transfection of a mir-30d mimic
remarkably reduced both total and cleaved caspase-3 protein
in both control and camptothecin-induced apoptotic cells. To
prove that mir-30d blocks chemotherapy drug-induced apoptosis, the apoptotic status after camptothecin treatment was
analyzed by ﬂow cytometry using an Annexin-V assay and
Western blots of PARP protein. Consistent with the above
results, we found that the transfection of a mir-30d mimic
signiﬁcantly reduces the apoptotic cells induced by camptothecin treatment (Fig. 3C and D). Taken together, the above
results show that mir-30d regulates proliferation, senescence,
and apoptosis in cancer cells, suggesting that mir-30d may
serve as an oncomir in human cancer.

mir-30d blockade signiﬁcantly inhibits tumor growth in
vivo
We next questioned whether mir-30d could regulate tumor
growth in vivo. Cancer cells (MDA-MB-231) in which mir-30d
had been knocked down by a lentiviral inhibitor and control
cells were injected subcutaneously into female nude mice
(Fig. 4). The cells in which mir-30d were knocked down lost
all in vivo growth ability, whereas the control cells grew well in
vivo in the same animal (Fig. 4A and B, n ¼ 5, P < 0.05). To
enhance tumorigenicity of mir-30d knocked down tumors, we
repeated the above experiments using tumor cells mixed with

158

Cancer Res; 72(1) January 1, 2012

Matrigel, a mixture of basement membrane proteins, tissue
plasminogen activators, and growth factors. To increase the
sensitivity of tumor visualization, a luciferase reporter expression vector was transfected into the MDA-MB-231 cells. We
found that the tumors produced by cells in which mir-30d had
been knocked down displayed slow growth in vivo with the
Matrigel mixture, consistent with the ﬁrst experiment (without
the Matrigel mixture). Thus, knockdown of mir-30d signiﬁcantly decreases the growth rate of tumors in vivo (Fig. 4C–E,
n ¼ 5, P < 0.05). This in vivo result provides further evidence
indicating that mir-30d is an oncomir in human cancer.

mir-30d exhibits a high frequency of genomic
ampliﬁcation in human solid tumors
Our previous aCGH study indicated that the DNA copy
number of mir-30d was ampliﬁed in about 50% of the ovarian
cancer (n ¼ 109) and 40% of the breast cancer (n ¼ 73)
specimens (32). First, we investigated whether there was a
positive correlation between the DNA copy number ampliﬁcation and mature mir-30d expression in primary tumors. We
analyzed mature and pre–mir-30d expression in 36 primary
ovarian tumor specimens by real-time RT-PCR and found that
both mature and pre–mir-30d expression was detectable in all
specimens and signiﬁcantly higher in the tumors with a high
DNA copy number of mir-30d (n ¼ 21, mature mir-30d:
P ¼ 0.014; pre–mir-30d: P < 0.001) compared with tumors
with no ampliﬁcation of mir-30d DNA copy number (n ¼ 15).
We also examined the 16 ovarian cancer cell lines. The average
level of mir-30d expression was higher in the cell lines with
ampliﬁed mir-30d DNA copy numbers (Fig. 5A). In addition,
the average level of mir-30d expression in these ovarian cancer
cell lines was remarkably higher than in IOSEs (Fig. 5A), which
were used as control cells for epithelial ovarian cancer (38).
These results show that genomic copy number ampliﬁcation of

www.aacrjournals.org

mir-30d increases mature mir-30d expression in human
cancer.
Next, we asked whether mir-30d also exhibits high levels of
genomic ampliﬁcation in other human cancers. We analyzed a
panel of high-resolution DNA copy number proﬁling data sets
that consisted of 1,282 primary tumors representing 9 human
cancer types (detailed information provided in the Methods
section and Supplementary Table S2). We found that the
genomic locus harboring mir-30d was signiﬁcantly ampliﬁed
in 8 of these 9 human cancers (Fig. 5B). For example, in breast
cancer (n ¼ 327), 8.1% of the specimens revealed that the
genomic locus harboring mir-30d was ampliﬁed to greater
than 5 copies, and 30.4% of the specimens indicated that mir30d was present in 3 to 5 copies (Fig. 5B). Overall, mir-30d was
ampliﬁed at a high frequency (>30%) in human solid tumors (n
¼ 1,282). In contrast, 2.7% of tumors displayed a heterozygous
deletion for mir-30d, and one specimen with a homozygous
deletion of mir-30d was found (Fig. 5B). These DNA copy
number proﬁling results were further validated using a SNP
array on 6 matching human tumor types (detailed information
provided in the Methods section). One hundred and ninety-two
established tumor cell lines were examined in this SNP array.

The genomic locus containing mir-30d was examined in each
cell line (Fig. 5C). Consistent with the aCGH ﬁndings, mir-30d
displayed remarkable ampliﬁcation in tumor cell lines
(Fig. 5B). In breast cancer (n ¼ 29), in 6.9% of specimens the
genomic locus harboring mir-30d was present in more than
5 copies, whereas 44.8% of the specimens had 3 to 5 copies
(Fig. 5B). Collectively, mir-30d was ampliﬁed in more than 30%
of the cancer cell lines examined (Fig. 5B, n ¼ 192).
Higher levels of mir-30d expression were signiﬁcantly
correlated with poor clinical outcomes in ovarian cancer
patients
To study the expression of mature mir-30d in human
cancer, in situ hybridization (ISH) was done on ovarian
cancer tissue arrays (n ¼ 330). We detected mature mir30d in the majority of ovarian cancer specimens (81.2%, 268/
330, Fig. 5D). Strong cytoplasmic hybridization signal was

160

Cancer Res; 72(1) January 1, 2012

mainly found in tumor islet but not stroma cells (Fig. 5D). To
further examine the clinical signiﬁcance of mir-30d expression, the cytoplasmic ISH signals were scored as negative or
weak positive (n ¼ 62), intermediate positive (n ¼ 161), and
strong positive (n ¼ 107, Fig. 5D). We found that higher
expression levels of mature mir-30d in ovarian cancer were
signiﬁcantly correlated with poor clinical outcomes in these
patients (Fig. 5E, P ¼ 0.0016). The above clinical information
(DNA copy number ampliﬁcation and correlation with survival) provides robust evidence that mir-30d does indeed
play a critical oncogenic role in the development and
progression of human cancer.
mir-30d regulates a large number of transcripts/genes in

affecting the production of proteins (40, 41), and more than
one miRNA can converge on a single target transcript (42).
Taken together, the potential regulatory circuitry afforded
by speciﬁc miRNAs may be enormous, although typically this
repression is relatively mild (39–41). Therefore, we believed
that the oncomiric function of mir-30d would be mediated
by repressing multiple signaling pathways rather than by
targeting one or a few cancer-associated proteins. To test
this hypothesis, we used microarray analyses to proﬁle the
transcriptional changes seen after the transfection of a mir30d mimic into 2 cancer cell lines (Fig. 6). Consistent with
other reports in the literature (39–41), the repression of
genome-wide transcription caused by mir-30d was typically
relatively mild. We found that the mir-30d mimic downregulated 462 and 376 transcripts in 2008 and MDA-MB-231
cells, respectively (Fig. 6A–E; Supplementary Tables S3 and
S4). To conﬁrm that the majority of the downregulated
transcripts were repressed by mir-30d directly, we undertook both bioinformatic and experimental validations. First,
following a method described by Krutzfeld and colleagues
(43), we calculated the number of nonoverlapping occurrences of each possible hexamer in every 30 -UTR (untranslated region) sequence of those downregulated transcripts

(377 and 313 annotated genes were included in 2008 and
MDA-MB-231, respectively). After dividing this by the length
of the 30 -UTR, we applied a 1-tailed Wilcoxon rank sum to
each normalized hexamer count distribution in downregulated versus unchanged 30 -UTRs using the online program
DIANA-mirExTra (ref. 34; Fig. 6B and D). The 3 hexamers
that were most overrepresented in the downregulated genes
were ACATTT, CATTTG, and ATTTGT (P < 1019) and
corresponded to the seed positions of mir-30d (Fig. 6B and
D). We also predicted mir-30d targets using TargetScan (33)
and found that 128 of 462 and 151 of 376 downregulated
transcripts in 2008 and MDA-MB-231, respectively, were
mir-30d predicated targets (Fig. 6E). This bioinformatic
evidence strongly suggests that a large percentage of those
downregulated transcripts were indeed directly repressed by
mir-30d. That is, about 30% to 60% of the downregulated
transcripts were direct mir-30d targets. In addition, about 1
of 3 (n ¼ 150) downregulated transcripts were shared by
both cell lines, and 79 of these were predicted to be mir-30d
targets by TargetScan (Supplementary Table S5). Finally,
11% (9 of 79) of these transcripts were selected and further
validated by real-time RT-PCR in 2008 and MDA-MB-231
cells, as well as another 2 independent cell lines, HCT116 and

A2780 (Fig. 6F and Supplementary Fig. S2). Notably, 3 of
known mir-30d targets identiﬁed by another group, GNAI2
(44) and GALNT1, GALNT7 (45) were consistently found in
our 79 transcript list (Fig. 6E). Taken together, these results
indicate that mir-30d represses a large number of transcripts
in cancer cells.
Most importantly, miRNA target predication programs
strongly indicated that CASP3, a central protein in the execution phase of cell apoptosis, was a potential target of mir-30d
(Fig. 7A). The mir-30d binding sites in the CASP3 30 -UTR
predicated by TargetScan were broadly conserved among
different species (Fig. 7A). In addition, we found that both
protein and mRNA levels of CASP3 were signiﬁcantly
repressed after transfection of mir-30d into cancer cells
(protein: Fig. 3B and mRNA: Fig. 6E and 7B). Thus, we used
a luciferase reporter assay to experimentally examine whether
mir-30d directly regulated CASP3 expression via its 30 -UTR. The
seeding sequences of mir-30d in the CASP3 30 -UTR were
mutated, and overexpression of mir-30d was found to significantly reduce luciferase activity in the wild type but not the
binding site mutant CASP3 30 -UTR reporters (Fig. 7C). These
results show that mir-30d directly regulates expression of
CASP3, a master regulator of apoptosis, in cancer cells. It is
one of important molecular mechanisms to explain our observation on cellular function of mir-30d in apoptosis and longterm maintenance of tumor cell growth.

Discussion
In this study, we report a novel, clinically guided, genetic
screening approach to identify oncomirs in human cancer.
This approach uses array-based proﬁling data as a clinical/
biological ﬁlter to generate a selected functional genetic
screening library. Our strategy can distinguish "causal" from
"bystander" genetic events to decrease noise and artiﬁcial
results and also requires less time and labor than wholegenome wide genetic screening approaches. With this novel
strategy, one promising oncomir candidate, mir-30d, was
successfully identiﬁed. This clinically guided genetic screening
approach is a powerful tool to identify oncomirs as biomarkers
for diagnosis or as targets for the development of cancer
treatments. There are also limitations of our strategy to
identify oncomirs. For example, only oncogenic miRNAs, especially miRNAs promoting tumor cell growth or survival, are
able to be identiﬁed by our current approach. This limitation
can be overcome by combining with other library screening
approaches such as transwell assay (to identify miRNAs promoting migration and invasion), soft agar assay (to identify
miRNAs inducing malignant transformation), and negative
selection approaches (to identify tumor suppressor miRNAs).
Finally, because our approach is based on an in vitro positive
selection strategy, the oncomirs that give a growth advantage
to tumor cells in vitro, such as promoting angiogenesis and

regulating antitumor immune response, cannot be identiﬁed
by our approach. Combination with an in vivo selection
approach will more closely recapitulate the pathobiology of
human cancers.
mir-30d was initially identiﬁed using this screening
approach, in which the cells harboring miRNAs producing a
growth advantage could be expanded in vitro. Subsequently,
our in vitro experiments showed that mir-30d regulates cell
proliferation, senescence, and apoptosis. In agreement with
our observations, Kumar and colleagues also reported that
mir-30d inhibits apoptosis in human cancer via regulation of
the p53 pathway (30). A similar function of mir-30d was also
observed in normal cells such as cardiomyocytes (37). Furthermore, using a xenograft model, we showed that inhibition
of endogenous mir-30d expression remarkably blocked tumor
growth in vivo. Two independent groups have provided strong
evidence indicating that mir-30d promotes tumor invasion and
metastasis in hepatocellular carcinoma via regulating GNAI2
(44) and in melanoma via repressing GALNT7 (45). Consistent
with these studies, we also found that mir-30d repressed GNAI2
and GALNT7 expression in ovarian and breast cancer cell lines
(Fig. 6E), and using an in vitro migration assay, we observed
that transfection of mir-30d signiﬁcantly promoted the migration of BT549 and MDA-MB-231 cells in vitro (Supplementary
Fig. S3). Our study found that the DNA copy number of mir-30d
was remarkably ampliﬁed (more than 30%) in 8 of 9 human
cancer types that were examined. This suggests that mir-30d
ampliﬁcation in human cancer is a common oncogenic event.
In agreement with our conclusion, 2 independent groups
reported that mir-30d was ampliﬁed in brain tumors (46) and
melanoma (45). Most importantly, we found that overexpression of mir-30d was signiﬁcantly associated with a poor clinical
outcome in human ovarian cancer patients. In addition, a
recent genome-wide serum miRNA proﬁling study showed that
higher levels of serum mir-30d were signiﬁcantly associated
with shorter survival times in non–small cell lung cancer
patients (47). Gaziel-Sovran and colleagues also reported that
higher levels of mir-30d expression was correlated with shorter
time to recurrence and lower overall survival in melanoma (45).
Taken together, the above evidence strongly suggests that mir30d serves as an oncomir in human cancer.
The results of this study indicate that mir-30d can downregulate a large number of transcripts in human cancer cells,
although as with most other miRNAs, this repression is rela-

tively mild (39–41). We identiﬁed 79 protein coding genes
which were predicted by bioinformatics to be potential direct
targets of mir-30d. We then showed that the expression of
these genes (involved in multiple cancer-associated pathways
such as apoptosis and migration) were indeed downregulated
by the transfection of a mir-30d mimic into each of the 2 cell
lines used in our microarray study as well as 2 independent
cancer cell lines. We found that CASP3, a central protein in the
execution phase of cell apoptosis, is a direct target of mir-30d.
Another mir-30d targets [GNAI2 which was identiﬁed in liver
cancer (44); GALNT1 and GALNT7, which were identiﬁed in
melanoma (45)] were also found in our target list. Notably, we
also found that a relatively large number of predicted mir-30d
target genes [49 of 462 in 2008 (ovarian cancer) and 72 of 376 in
MDA-MB-231 (breast cancer) cells, respectively (Fig. 6E)] were
only downregulated in one cell line in our microarray study.
This indicates that the function of mir-30d may be cell-context
dependent or tumor-type speciﬁc. In agreement with our
ﬁnding, Martines and colleagues showed that the mir-30 family
regulates B-Myb expression in a cervical cancer cell line (48).
Finally, because mir-30d regulates a large number of protein
coding genes, it may regulate multiple cancer-associated pathways. For example, beyond apoptosis and migration, the mir30 family may also regulate autophagy (49), immune suppression (45), and cancer stem cell differentiation (50). Therefore,
the biological function and clinical signiﬁcance of mir-30d in
human cancer may be complex and dependent on the context
of downstream targets and molecular networks in each speciﬁc
cancer type.
