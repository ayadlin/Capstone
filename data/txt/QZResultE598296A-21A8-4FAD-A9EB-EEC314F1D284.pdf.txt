Abstract

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

The c-Met receptor is a potential therapeutic target for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
Signaling interactions between c-Met and the mutant Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR)
have been studied extensively, but signaling intermediates and biological consequences of lateral
signaling to c-Met in EGFR wild-type tumors is minimally understood. Our observations indicate
that delayed c-Met activation in NSCLC cell lines is initiated by wild-type EGFR, the receptor
most often found in NSCLC tumors. EGFR ligands induce accumulation of activated c-Met which
begins at 8 h continues for 48 h. This effect is accompanied by an increase in c-Met expression
and phosphorylation of critical c-Met tyrosine residues without activation of MAPK or Akt. Gene
transcription is required for delayed c-Met activation; however, phosphorylation of c-Met by
EGFR occurs without production of HGF or another secreted factor, supporting a ligandindependent mechanism. Lateral signaling is blocked by two selective c-Met tyrosine kinase
inhibitors (TKIs), PF2341066 and SU11274, or with gefitinib, an EGFR TKI, suggesting kinase
activity of both receptors is required for this effect. Prolonged c-Src phosphorylation is observed,
and c-Src pathway is essential for EGFR to c-Met communication. Pre-treatment with pan-SFK
inhibitors, PP2 and dasatinib, abolishes delayed c-Met phosphorylation. A c-Src dominantnegative construct reduces EGF-induced c-Met phosphorylation compared to control, further,
confirming a c-Src requirement. Inhibition of c-Met with PF2341066 and siRNA decreases EGFinduced phenotypes of invasion by ~86% and motility by ~81%, suggesting that a novel form of cMet activation is utilized by EGFR to maximize these biological effects. Combined targeting of cMet and EGFR leads to increased xenograft anti-tumor activity, demonstrating that inhibition of
downstream and lateral signaling from the EGFR-c-Src-c-Met axis might be effective in treatment
of NSCLC.

Introduction

Author Manuscript

EGFR is a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) that exhibits cellular action not only through
ligands such as epidermal growth factor (EGF), transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-α),
and amphiregulin, but also through interactions with other RTKs and G-protein coupled
receptors (Daub et al., 1997; Knowlden et al., 2005; Liu et al., 2007; Thomas et al., 2006).
EGFR regulates well-characterized signaling cascades that modulate invasive growth, a
program requiring precise coordination of growth, motility, and angiogenesis that is
unregulated in human cancers (Ritter & Arteaga, 2003). Because of this, EGFR has been a
strong candidate for therapeutic targeting with tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as gefitinib
and erlotinib in many cancers, including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However,
despite preclinical evidence demonstrating high efficacy of EGFR inhibitors, these
expectations were unmatched in clinical settings (Molina et al., 2006). One reason that these
EGFR inhibitors have not met expectations is due to compensatory signaling through
mechanisms involving additional RTKs. Specifically, there has been strong evidence linking
EGFR to activation of another prominent RTK involved in invasive growth, c-Met
(Engelman et al., 2007).

C-Met interacts with the Hepatocyte Growth Factor (HGF) ligand, also identified as Scatter
Factor, in a paracrine, endocrine, or autocrine manner (Bottaro et al., 1991; Nakamura et al.,
1986; Naldini et al., 1991c; Stoker et al., 1987). Canonical activation of c-Met occurs when
two c-Met monomers interact, inducing trans-autophosphorylation on tyrosine residues
Y1230, Y1234, and Y1235 within the kinase domain. This activation leads to subsequent
phosphorylation on tyrosine residues Y1349 and Y1356, which comprise the multi-substrate
docking site, and allows recruitment of adaptor molecules responsible for downstream
signaling such as Gab1 and c-Src (Ma et al., 2003; Naldini et al., 1991a; Naldini et al.,
1991b; Ponzetto et al., 1994). Additionally, phosphorylation of Y1365 regulates cell
morphogenesis, and Y1003 is required for internalization and degradation of c-Met through
c-Cbl interaction (Peschard et al., 2001). The HGF-c-Met interaction is critical in a number
of tightly controlled physiological processes such as tissue regeneration, in contrast to
uncontrolled HGF/c-Met activation in tumorigenesis (Trusolino & Comoglio, 2002). Like
EGFR, dysregulated HGF/c-Met signaling has been implicated in many cancers including
NSCLC, and disruption of this pathway by c-Met-directed inhibitors decreases tumorigenic
potential (Ma et al., 2005; Stabile et al., 2004; Stabile et al., 2008).
C-Met is frequently co-expressed with EGFR family members in human tumors, and it has
been demonstrated that these RTKs can signal to one another (Fischer et al., 2004; Jo et al.,
2000; Nakajima et al., 1999; Shattuck et al., 2008). Presnell et al. first showed that c-Met
could be trans-activated by EGFR in rat liver epithelial cells constitutively expressing TGFα (Presnell et al., 1997). Similar studies have since observed this signaling in NSCLC tumor
models where EGFR contains activating mutations such as L858R or E746-A750del (Guo et

al., 2008). Additionally, lateral signaling to c-Met from EGFR has been identified in EGFR
wild-type models, and much of this data suggests that cross-communication from EGFR to
c-Met is dependent on EGFR or c-Met expression levels (Bergstrom et al., 2000; Ponzetto et
al., 1991). To further validate this mechanism, Xu et al. recently demonstrated that induction
of c-Met phosphorylation required upregulation of c-Met through EGFR-activated HIF-1α
in both EGFR wild-type and mutant cell lines (Xu et al., 2010). Despite these increasing
reports of EGFR –c-Met lateral signaling, the underlying mechanism of EGFR-induced cMet phosphorylation is not well understood, and the extent of involvement of c-Met in
carrying out EGFR-initiated phenotypes has not been well documented. Because c-Met
signaling acts as an acquired resistance mechanism to EGFR TKI therapy, preclinical efforts
are ongoing to augment c-Met targeted therapies with EGFR inhibitors to facilitate tumor
growth inhibition (Engelman et al., 2007; Tang et al., 2008; Yano et al., 2008).

We previously demonstrated that exogenous PGE2 stimulated invasion in our NSCLC
model system through an intricate signaling axis requiring EGFR ligand production, c-Met,
and the Src family kinases (SFK) (Siegfried et al., 2007). Here, we extend our studies to
show that EGFR activation of c-Met in NSCLC cells is a delayed event that occurs not
through HGF ligand production, but through an intracellular signaling cascade requiring
gene transcription as well as tyrosine kinase activities of EGFR, the c-Src, and c-Met. We
also found evidence for formation of a complex between c-Met and c-Src that was maximal
at 24 h after EGF stimulation. Moreover, c-Met pharmacologic inhibition and siRNA
knockdown reduced EGF-induced invasion and motility confirming that EGFR requires cMet to maximize invasive phenotypes. In combining EGFR (gefitinib) and c-Met
(PF2341066) tyrosine kinase inhibitors, we observed a statistically significant reduction in
xenograft tumor growth of a NSCLC cell line expressing wild-type EGFR, compared to
individual targeting. These results indicate that EGFR-induced, HGF-ligand independent
delayed c-Met activation requires c-Src, and suggest that EGFR utilizes lateral signaling to
c-Met for maximal stimulation of processes of invasive and motility that promote lung
cancer.

Results
EGFR Ligands Induce Prolonged Phosphorylation and Increased c-Met Protein Levels in
NSCLC Cells

Author Manuscript

It has been demonstrated that EGFR activation contributes to c-Met tyrosine
phosphorylation in a variety of cell models, with varying kinetic parameters (Fischer et al.,
2004; Xu et al., 2010) Since NSCLC commonly express both receptors, we examined
whether EGFR ligands induce c-Met phosphorylation in human NSCLC cell lines. 201T and
A549 cells were selected because of moderate expression levels of wild-type EGFR and
wild-type c-Met, which is representative of the majority of NSCLC tumors found in patients
(Fig. S1). C-Met also is not amplified in these cell lines (data not shown). Analysis of
activated c-Met was performed following stimulation with ligands EGF, TGF-α, or HGF.
Time-course analysis of EGF and TGF-α treated 201T cells revealed that c-Met
phosphorylation first appears at 8 h, is sustained at maximal levels for 48 h, and decreases
thereafter, while EGFR phosphorylation begins at 5 minutes and is completed by 1 h (Fig.

1a, Fig. S2, and Data not shown). In contrast, HGF stimulation induced c-Met
phosphorylation that begins within 5 minutes and quickly terminates. (Fig. 1a). Similar
results were obtained in A549 and H1435 cells (Fig. S3). EGFR ligand stimulation also
resulted in a 1.5- (EGF) to 2.0- (TGF-α) fold increase in total c-Met protein levels
(p<0.0005) and a 2–4 fold up-regulation of c-Met transcript levels at 24 h (p<0.005) (Fig. 1b
and S4).
Pre-incubation with the pan-transcription inhibitor, Actinomycin D, prior to EGF
administration abolished the increase in total c-Met protein and corresponding delayed
phosphorylation of c-Met, while having no effect on direct activation by HGF (Fig. 1d). This
demonstrates that a transcriptional component is required for EGFR trans-phosphorylation
of c-Met and that the increase in c-Met expression is due to new c-Met transcription.

Author Manuscript

The individual c-Met tyrosine residues required for activation and cell signaling are well
characterized. The initiating event for c-Met activation is phosphorylation at residues
Y1230/Y1234/Y1235 followed by residues required for cell signaling such as Y1349,
Y1365, and Y1003. To determine whether c-Met is being phosphorylated in response to
EGFR ligands in a manner similar to HGF, we measured individual phospho-tyrosine levels
of c-Met. It was confirmed that following EGF stimulation, all c-Met tyrosine residues
analyzed were phosphorylated and followed a pattern similar to HGF stimulation, albeit at
delayed time points (Fig. 1c). Together, these data suggest a novel mode by which EGFR
can regulate a prolonged, full activation of c-Met through phosphorylation that persists for
long periods and increased c-Met protein.
Kinase Activities of Both EGFR and c-Met are Necessary for c-Met Phosphorylation
Induced by EGF

Author Manuscript

To ascertain the signaling cascade responsible for c-Met phosphorylation, use of the EGFR
tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), gefitinib, was employed to discern whether EGFR tyrosine
kinase activity was required. Pretreatment with gefitinib abolished tyrosine phosphorylation
of c-Met induced by EGF, while not inhibiting rapid c-Met tyrosine phosphorylation in
response to HGF (Fig. 2a and 2c). Additionally, gefitinib also inhibited the accompanied
increase in total c-Met protein following EGF treatment (Fig. 2a). No association was
observed between EGFR and c-Met (Data not shown). These results confirmed that
induction of an active EGFR by EGF was needed to facilitate c-Met phosphorylation.

Author Manuscript

We next addressed whether kinase activity of c-Met, itself, is required for delayed c-Met
phosphorylation. To address this, 201T cells were pretreated with c-Met TKIs, SU11274 and
PF2341066, and c-Met phosphorylation status was measured following EGF stimulation
(Fig. 2b). These c-Met TKIs had no effect on EGFR autophosphorylation induced by EGF
(Fig. 2d). C-Met inhibitors ablated all c-Met phosphorylation initiated by EGF, while having
no effect on c-Met protein up-regulation, demonstrating that c-Met is not being utilized by
EGFR as an adaptor-like molecule, but rather delayed activation of c-Met kinase activity is
used to relay the EGFR signal (Fig. 2b).

C-Src is a Key Biphasic Mediator in Signal Transmittance from EGFR to c-Met

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

The Src family kinases (SFK) are a group of non-receptor tyrosine kinases including c-Src,
which regulate downstream tumorigenic phenotypes (Klinghoffer et al., 1999) This family,
particularly c-Src, has been identified as a key intermediary in regulating multiple steps for
lateral RTK-RTK signaling (Popsueva et al., 2003). Because of these data and observations
of c-Met tyrosine phosphorylation, we hypothesized that the SFKs are critical signaling
molecules in delayed EGFR activation of c-Met in NSCLC. To identify the presence of SFK
members, we assessed protein expression in the lung cancer cell lines. It was observed that
c-Src was ubiquitously expressed across our NSCLC cells (Fig. S1). Activation of c-Src is
known to be downstream of EGFR (Goi et al., 2000). Therefore, we assessed the response to
EGF stimulation at delayed time points corresponding with c-Met phosphorylation by
measuring levels of activated c-Src in 201T cells. The results suggest that EGF stimulation
activated c-Src in a biphasic, and a continually increasing, manner (Fig. 3a). The initial
activation of c-Src was present 2 h post-EGF stimulation and was subsequently reduced to
near baseline levels by 4 h, while the second wave of greater activation was initiated 8 h
post-treatment and lasted 48 h. This pattern of c-Src phosphorylation suggests a temporal
association between delayed c-Src activation and delayed c-Met activation following EGF
stimulation. PF2341066 treatment does not block delayed c-Src phosphorylation at 8 h–24
suggesting that all c-Src activation is upstream of c-Met (Fig. S5). C-Src plays a central role
in mediating invasive phenotypes, and c-Src inhibition blocks all EGF-induced migration of
NSCLC cells at 48 h (Fig. S6).

Author Manuscript

We explored whether inhibition of the SFKs could block EGFR-induced c-Met
phosphorylation through the use of pan-SFK inhibitors, PP2 and dasatinib. Pretreatment
with either PP2 or dasatinib blocked all EGF-induced c-Met phosphorylation while having
minimal effect on increased total c-Met protein (Fig. 3b). In contrast, neither PP2 nor
dasatinib showed any inhibitory effect on c-Met autophosphorylation (Fig. 3b)
demonstrating that the SFKs are an intermediary needed for signaling from EGFR to c-Met.
To discern whether c-Src, specifically, is a key mediator, 201T cells were stably transfected
with either a dominant-negative c-Src construct (DN-Src) that reduced c-Src activity in both
DN-Src-4 and DN-Src-9 clones by 28% and 66%, respectively compared to an empty vector
(EV) plasmid as published previously (Data not shown) and (Liu et al., 2007). Stimulation
of DN-Src cells for 24 h with EGF resulted in a 2 to 3-fold decrease in total c-Met
phosphorylation compared to 201T EV cells (Fig. 3b). Through co-immunoprecipitation
studies following 24 h EGF stimulation, we found that there is no evidence of a c-Src/c-Met
or a c-Src/EGFR association up to 24 h suggesting that no persistent EGFR/c-Src/c-Met
signaling complex is formed and that c-Src activity at 8 h–48 h may indirectly induce c-Met
phosphorylation (Data not shown). This does not rule out the possibility that c-Src might
directly phosphorylate c-Met through a transient interaction.
It has been hypothesized that c-Met dimerization and activation can result from increased cMet density (Bergstrom et al., 2000; Ponzetto et al., 1991). Therefore, we determined
whether c-Src activation through EGFR was required for elevated c-Met mRNA levels.
Surprisingly, blockade of c-Src by PP2 had no significant effect on EGF-induced c-Met
transcript levels suggesting that c-Src is not upstream of the modest increase in c-Met

protein, but may be upstream of other critical transcriptional events (Fig. 3c and Fig. 4d).
These experiments advocate that c-Src is a candidate molecule that is likely involved at
multiple points leading to initialization of EGFR –c-Met trans-activation, although the exact
role remains unclear and participation of other SFKs in some of the effect cannot be
excluded.
HGF Autocrine Signaling is not Responsible for EGFR-induced c-Met Phosphorylation

Author Manuscript

HGF autocrine loops have been observed in many tissue types; therefore, analysis of HGF
production and secretion was performed at times corresponding with c-Met phosphorylation
induced by EGF. 201T and A549 cells were treated with EGF under serum-free conditions
and tissue culture media was harvested for HGF ELISA. No HGF secretion was detected at
any time point, suggesting that autocrine signaling is not occurring (Fig. 4a). To confirm this
observation, mRNA was harvested from 201T cells following exposure to EGF, and HGF
levels were measured. The results from the qRT-PCR assay detected no presence of the
HGF transcript produced in unstimulated or stimulated NSCLC cells. (Fig. 4b). It was also
observed that media harvested from 24 h EGF-treated 201T cells did not induce c-Met
phosphorylation on serum-deprived 201T cells up to 48 h, suggesting that no secreted factor
is responsible for c-Met activation (Data not shown). A neutralizing antibody to HGF did
not block EGF-induced phosphorylation of c-Met (Fig. 4c). Based on these data, HGF is not
involved in EGF-initiated c-Met lateral signaling. Taken together, our findings favor an
intracellular lateral signaling cascade from EGFR to c-Met that involves, and transcription
of an as-yet unidentified protein that initiates delayed c-Met phosphorylation (Fig. 4d).
C-Met Inhibition Abrogates EGF-induced Invasive Growth Phenotypes

Author Manuscript

It is well-documented that both EGFR and c-Met initiate signaling cascades for invasive
growth, and downstream signaling from each RTK involves similar molecules (Trusolino &
Comoglio, 2002). Based on our observations of delayed c-Met activation by EGF, we
hypothesized that c-Met mediates at least part of the EGFR-induced invasion and motility
that leads to tumor progression. PF2341066 treatment significantly reduced EGF-induced
201T and A549 cellular invasion by 86% at 48 h (Fig. 5a). Cell motility through EGFR, as
assessed by 48 h wound healing assay, was also inhibited with PF2341066 by 81% and 57%
in 201T and A549 cells, respectively (Fig. 5b).

Author Manuscript

To confirm these findings, invasion and wound healing experiments were repeated with cMet specific siRNA. Knockdown of c-Met by siRNA resulted in a 92% specific reduction of
c-Met compared to the non-targeting siRNA (Fig. 5d). This knockdown resulted in similar
results to PF2341066 in EGF-induced wound healing and invasion experiments, where a
77% and 53% reduction in EGF-induced invasion and wound healing was observed in 201T
cells, respectively (Fig. 5c). Cell proliferation in response to EGFR ligand only increases
cell number by about 25% at 24 h when maximal migration is inhibited. Knockdown of cMet does inhibit this modest growth response, so it is possible that c-Met does participate in
some EGFR-induced growth responses (Data not shown). Despite c-Met being
phosphorylated at all tyrosines and required for EGFR phenotypes, delayed c-Met activation
by EGF was not associated with MAPK and Akt phosphorylation, suggesting that these
normal elements of c-Met signaling are not re-activated by c-Met at delayed time points

(Fig. 5e). These results indicate that EGFR utilizes lateral activation of c-Met to maximize
cell motility and invasion through non-classical, delayed signaling mechanisms.
Combinational Targeting of c-Met and EGFR have Enhanced Anti-tumor Activity in a
Xenograft Model of NSCLC

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

There is increasing evidence that c-Met compensatory signaling acts as a resistance
mechanism against EGFR TKIs. In particular, Engelman, et al. has established that c-Met
signaling was a driver of acquired EGFR TKI resistance in EGFR mutant lung cancer cells
(Engelman et al., 2007). NSCLC with wild-type EGFR are also inherently resistant to EGFR
TKIs. The identification of delayed c-Met activation in NSCLC cells with wild-type EGFR,
as in the case of a majority of NSCLC patients, provides a rationale for combining therapies
to improve response to EGFR TKIs. To address whether combinational targeting of EGFR
and c-Met pathways leads to enhanced anti-tumor effects, athymic nude mice bearing 201T
flank tumors were treated with either gefitinib, PF2341066, combination, or vehicle for 5
d/wk for 3 weeks. PF2341066 alone at a dose of 50 mg/kg had no significant effect on
inhibiting tumor xenograft growth, whereas gefitinib significantly reduced tumor volume by
51%. Combining TKI therapies produced a 66% decrease in tumor volume; a significantly
greater effect compared to PF2341066 and gefitinib groups, individually (Fig. 6a). EGFR
and c-Met targets were confirmed in treatment groups by immunohistochemistry (Fig. S7).
Ki-67 staining of tumors at 28 days revealed that the combination group had a significantly
greater effect compared to individual PF2341066 and gefitinib treatments (Fig. 6b).
Although minimal inhibition of xenograft tumor volume was observed with PF2341066
treatment alone, a significant decrease in Ki-67 staining was measured (Fig. 6a and 6b). This
is likely due to stromal tissue comprising 40% of tumor volume in the PF2341066 treated
group. Stromal cells appear not to be actively proliferating as shown in Figure 6b. Because
remodeling of tumor architecture follows PF2341066 treatment, volume measurements
likely underestimate the true anti-tumor effect.

Discussion

Author Manuscript

We present findings characterizing a novel mode of delayed lateral communication from
EGFR to c-Met that is dependent on c-Src and mediates invasion and cell movement. These
findings provide an alternative-working model of c-Met activation by EGFR in NSCLC cell
lines expressing wild-type, non-amplified EGFR and c-Met. Here, EGFR ligands induce
prolonged c-Met tyrosine phosphorylation after a pronounced delay that is not attributable to
an HGF-ligand autocrine production. Additionally, we have ruled out the secretion of other
factors that might trigger c-Met phosphorylation because conditioned media experiments
could not replicate the EGF-induced effect. While increased c-Met transcription was
observed following EGF treatment of NSCLC cells, along with a modest increase in total cMet protein, this increase in c-Met protein levels appears not to be solely responsible for the
delayed c-Met phosphorylation because it is independent of c-Src activity. Based on a recent
report, the rise in protein level may be attributed to induction of new c-Met transcripts
through EGFR activation of the HIF-1α pathway (Xu et al., 2010). Moreover, studies in
thyroid carcinoma and human gastric carcinoma cells suggested that increased c-Met levels
alone might lead to receptor activation, but conclude that there was a requirement of

additional factors to achieve phosphorylation (Bergstrom et al., 2000; Ponzetto et al., 1991).
Although it has been shown that c-Src can signal to HIF-1α, c-Src is minimally involved in
our model because PP2 had almost no effect on c-Met protein and mRNA levels following
EGF stimulation (Karni et al., 2002). This suggests that in the NSCLC cell studies, c-Srcdependent c-Met phosphorylation is a distinct event from c-Met upregulation. We cannot,
however, rule out that de novo c-Met molecules are also contributing to this novel pathway
in some capacity. This is the first time c-Src has been implicated as a critical intermediary
linking EGFR activation to c-Met phosphorylation.

Author Manuscript

Activation of invasion and motility are hallmarks of EGFR signaling that drive lung tumor
progression (Ritter & Arteaga, 2003). We showed that EGFR activation of invasive
phenotypes rely largely on c-Met signaling through an HGF-independent pathway. A
possible explanation for this is that EGFR utilizes c-Met as a second-in-line molecule not to
initiate response, but to amplify the complex phenotypic programs following early activation
by EGFR. We also anticipate that an alternative c-Met cascade is being activated at delayed
time points, as MAPK and Akt are not phosphorylated at time points corresponding to c-Met
phosphorylation. This mode of signaling might occur through intracellular relocalization of
a distinct population of c-Met molecules that do not associate with the Gab1 adaptor protein
that is known to be required for prolonged MAPK activation (Cai et al., 2002). Early, but
not yet reproduced confocal microscopy studies, point to an intracellular
compartmentalization of c-Met molecules 24 h following EGF addition. Sequestering of cMet might stabilize c-Met and allow for an altered mode of signaling. Future studies will
aim to measure the levels of effectors responsible for the late-acting signaling from c-Met
such as E-cadherin, focal adhesion kinase, and other potential candidates downstream of cMet that regulate invasive phenotypes (Kim et al., 2009).

Author Manuscript

Our results suggest a model for lateral signaling from EGFR to c-Met that involves
intracellular intermediates and requires both gene transcription and extended c-Src
activation that is upstream of c-Met. The fully phosphorylated c-Met molecules that
accumulate at delayed time points do not activate common downstream mediators such as
MAPK and Akt. The observed temporal association between c-Met and c-Src activation
suggests they might cooperate and lead to prolonged activation of regulatory molecules
responsible for invasion and cell motility downstream of both c-Met and c-Src (Fig. 4d). We
hypothesize that after EGFR stimulation, c-Src activates a signaling cascade that leads to
transcription of an unknown intermediate accompanying the c-Met protein increase. This
intermediary might also be required for late c-Src activation. It does not appear that a
complex between c-Met and c-Src forms at these late time points. Having ruled out secreted
factors, a probable scenario for late c-Src activation involves the production of molecules
that shift c-Src toward increased phosphorylation status such as increased association with
Src homology-2 domain-containing proteins or increased phosphatase activity to remove
inhibitory phosphorylation. It is possible that increased integrin production or clustering
might account for both c-Met and c-Src events as both kinases demonstrate increased
phosphorylation in response to integrin interaction with the substratum (DanilkovitchMiagkova et al., 2000; Moro et al., 2002; Wang et al., 1996). The c-Met and c-Src events
might be linear or parallel with one another and future studies will aim to determine whether

integrins have a role in delayed c-Met phosphorylation by EGFR ligand (Pawson & Scott,
1997).
An alternate model for c-Met activation was considered, where c-Src might directly
phosphorylate c-Met. Here, we showed that although delayed c-Src activation is coupled
with delayed c-Met phosphorylation, no stabilized association between c-Src and c-Met was
observed. These data conflict with such a model, and suggest that c-Src is not directly
phosphorylating c-Met, implying an additional mediator is needed for increased c-Met
phosphorylation. It is still possible that c-Src might regulate more than one event in this
pathway due to prolonged c-Src phosphorylation.

Clinical responses to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) in NSCLC patients have
produced variable results (Molina et al., 2006). In East Asian populations, where there is a
high rate of EGFR mutation (~40%), EGFR targeted therapies give a good response. In
contrast, patients from western countries tend to have a low frequency of EGFR mutations
(3–8% of all lung tumors) and respond poorly to EGFR TKIs (Wu et al., 2008). In studies
reported here, we focused our efforts on EGFR –c-Met communication in NSCLC cell lines
expressing wild-type EGFR and c-Met. Through identification of a dual-regulation paradigm
of tumorigenic signaling from EGFR to c-Met, we further show that combining EGFR and
c-Met TKIs provided an enhanced inhibition of tumor growth and a concurrent reduction in
Ki-67 staining in 201T xenograft tumors. These results suggest a rationale for simultaneous
targeting of EGFR and c-Met to short-circuit signaling cascades responsible for invasive
growth initiated and maintained through both receptors as well as trans-activation from
EGFR to c-Met.

Author Manuscript

In summary, we present findings identifying a signaling requirement for c-Met to achieve
maximal EGFR-induced invasion and motility, that occurs through delayed events involving
c-Src. Delayed c-Met signaling occurs through a non-canonical pathway. Targeting c-Met in
addition to EGFR leads to an enhanced anti-tumor effects in a wild-type, non-amplified
EGFR and c-Met cell line. The findings presented in this study provide insight regarding the
manner by which the EGFR–c-Src–c-Met axis regulates lung tumor progression through
varied temporal modulation. Future studies will seek to clarify the exact role of c-Src and
which other potential signaling intermediaries are active in EGFR-c-Met lateral signaling as
well as to identify what effector molecules downstream of delayed c-Met signaling regulate
invasion and motility in NSCLC in response to EGFR ligands.

and H1435 were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and
maintained at 37°C in 5% CO2 (Siegfried et al., 1999). All cells were grown in Basal
Medium Eagle (BME) with 10% fetal bovine serum and 2 mM L-Glutamine. Rabbit
polyclonal anti-pY1349-Met, anti-pY1365-Met, anti-Y1003-Met, and anti-pY418-Src as
well as mouse monoclonal anti-c-Src were obtained from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). Rabbit
anti-c-Met (C-28), mouse anti-c-Src (B-12) and mouse anti-pY99 were purchased from

Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Mouse anti-c-Met, rabbit anti-EGFR, rabbit
anti-Y1234/35-Met and anti-rabbit and anti-mouse-HRP linked secondary antibodies were
obtained from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA). Anti-EGFR, mouse, antibody was purchased
BD Transduction Laboratories (San Jose, CA). Dasatinib and gefitinib were from Chemitek
(Indianapolis, IN). Actinomycin D, SU11274, and PP2 were purchased from Calbiochem
(San Diego, CA). The c-Met and non-targeting siRNA ON-TARGETplus SMARTpools
were purchased from Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO). EGF, TGF-α, HGF, HGF neutralizing
antibody, and non-immune IgG control were purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis,
MN).
Cell Treatments, Immunoprecipitation, and Immunoblotting

Author Manuscript

Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and lysed with NP-40 buffer as
described previously (Stabile et al., 2008). The insoluble fraction was cleared by
centrifugation at 10000 × g for 15 min at 4°C. Protein concentrations were measured by
Bradford Assay (Pierce). For immunoprecipitation, equal protein was subjected to preclearing and immunoprecipitation with antibodies overnight at 4°C then incubated with
Protein A-Agarose Beads (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Rockford, IL) for 2 h at 4°C.
Immunoblotting was performed as described previously (Stabile et al., 2008). For reprobing,
blots were stripped using IgG Elution Buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Blots were
quantified by densitometry and ImageJ analysis (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda,
MD). For immunoprecipitations, all phospho-proteins were normalized to respective total
immunoprecipitated protein, and whole cell lysate proteins utilized β-actin for quantitation.
Human HGF ELISA

Author Manuscript

Cell culture media was harvested and analyzed in duplicate by Quantikine Human HGF
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA; R&D Systems) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Conditioned media from fibroblasts was used as a positive
control for HGF.
Quantitative Real Time-PCR
Total RNA was extracted using the RNAeasy kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to
manufacturer’s directions. cDNA was synthesized by a single reverse transcription reaction
in a thermocycler. The primers and probes used for detection of HGF, c-Met and βglucuronidase are provided in supplementary data.
Wound Healing Assay

Author Manuscript

Cells were plated on 12-well plates, grown to a confluent monolayer, and serum-deprived
for 24 h. Wounds were created and washed twice with 1X PBS. All treatments were applied
every 24 h over the experimental time course. Three wells per experimental treatment were
examined 10X magnification by light microscope. Migration distance was assessed by
measuring the ability of cells to close the wound area.

Matrigel Invasion Assay

Author Manuscript

Growth Factor Reduced Matrigel-coated Transwell chambers (BD Biosciences) were
activated in serum-free media at 37°C for 2 h. NSCLC cells (1×104) were serum-deprived
for 24 h and plated on transwell chambers in 1% charcoal-stripped FBS containing media in
the top chamber containing indicated inhibitor treatments. In the bottom chamber, growth
factors and inhibitors were refreshed every 24 h. Non-invading cells in the top chamber were
removed by cotton swab, and invading cells were fixed and stained using Diff-Quik staining
solutions according to the manufacturer’s instructions (VWR International). The number of
invading cells was counted at 10X magnification.
siRNA Transfection

Author Manuscript

201T cells were transfected with 50 pmol of either c-Met or non-targeting siRNA pools
using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) for 8 h. Transfection medium was replaced overnight
followed by experimental treatments.
In vivo Tumor Xenograft Model

Author Manuscript

Female athymic nude-Foxn1nu mice were obtained from Harlan (Somerville, NJ). 201T
cells were suspended in serum-free PBS supplemented with 50% Matrigel (BD
Biosciences). Cells (2 ×106) were injected in the hind flank region of each mouse and
allowed to develop. Ten days after tumor implantation the mice were divided into 4
treatment groups (10 mice per group): (a) placebo, (b) PF2341066 (c) gefitnib (d)
PF2341066 plus gefitnib. Treatment with PF2341066 (50 mg/kg) or vehicle control (0.9%
saline/1% Tween-80) was administered daily by oral gavage and gefitnib (150 mg/kg) was
administered twice a week by oral gavage for 3 weeks. Tumor size was measured weekly
and reported as an average relative tumor volume calculated as (length × width × height ×
p)/2 (mm3). At the end of the treatment period, animals were sacrificed; tumors were
removed, and fixed in 10% buffered formalin for immunohistochemical analysis. Animal
care was in strict compliance with the institutional guidelines established by the University
of Pittsburgh.
Statistical Analysis
All values are expressed as the mean ± S.E.M. Student’s t test except for the tumor
xenograft experiment when an unpaired t-test with Welch’s correction was utilized.
Significance tests were performed with a two-sided significance level of 0.05.

EGFR activation of c-Met does not require HGF production or secretion. A549 and 201T
cells were serum starved 2 days prior to stimulation with EGF (10 nM). (A) Tissue culture
media was harvested for 0–24 h time points and subjected to HGF ELISA with fibroblastconditioned media (FCM) as a positive control. (B) Cells were treated, mRNA was
harvested, and subjected to HGF quantitative RT-PCR using β-Gus as an internal control.
Normal lung fibroblast (NLF) mRNA was utilized as a positive control while the breast
cancer cell line, MCF-7, was used as a negative control for HGF expression. (C) EGF (10
nM) or HGF (10 ng/mL) was pretreated for 2 h with HGF neutralizing antibody or IgG
control (300 ng/mL) prior to addition to 201T cells for 24 h. Cell lysates were prepared and
analyzed for phospho- and total c-Met levels. (D) Proposed model of delayed c-Met
activation. In NSCLC cells, EGFR ligands induce a delayed accumulation of tyrosine
phosphorylated c-Met receptors as well as an increase in total c-Met levels. EGFR ligands
activate EGFR tyrosine kinase activity, which leads to rapid c-Src signaling and new gene
transcription that is required for EGFR-c-Met lateral communication. At delayed time
points, activated c-Src continues to accumulate, and c-Met is phosphorylated to maximize
EGFR-activated phenotypes of invasion and motility. Production of unidentified proteins
might cooperate with c-Src to cause c-Met phosphorylation. This could occur by promoting
the clustering of c-Met molecules.

EGFR relies on c-Met for maximal induction of EGFR phenotypes. 201T and A549 cells
were serum deprived for 24 h prior to all 48 h phenotypic assays stimulated with EGF (50
ng/mL) or HGF (50 ng/mL). For experiments involving PF2341066 (1 μM), cells were
pretreated with the c-Met inhibitor or DMSO for 2 h. For c-Met siRNA transfection
experiments, 201T cells were plated and subjected to non-targeting siRNA or c-Met siRNA.
Following transfection, cells were serum deprived in 24-well Matrigel invasion chambers or
12-well plates for wound healing assays. (A) Cells were plated in Matrigel invasion
chambers with growth factors added to the lower chamber only. Invading cells of three
independent experiments were counted. (B) Cells were grown on 12-well plates prior to
serum starvation and wounding. Addition of ligands followed c-Met inhibitor pretreatment
or siRNA knockdown. Wounds were imaged at 0 and 48 h by 10X light microscopy.
Migrating cells were measured by comparing 48 h wound size to initial wound size and
expressed as percent wound closure. Mean of three independent samples per treatment
group. (C) Invasion and wound healing assays were repeated in 201T cells with c-Met or
non-targeting siRNA knockdown as described previously. Mean of three independent
samples per treatment group. (D) 201T cells were mock transfected or treated with either
non-targeting siRNA (NT) or c-Met siRNA for 8 h. After 48 h, cell lysates were prepared
and analyzed for total c-Met levels, c-Src, and β-Actin. (E) 201T cells were serum-deprived
for 2 days prior to pretreatment with PF2341066 (1 μM) followed by stimulation with either
EGF (10 nM) or HGF (10 ng/mL). In separate experiments, cell lysates were analyzed for
