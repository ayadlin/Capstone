Abstract
Impairing the division of cancer cells with genotoxic small
molecules has been a primary goal to develop chemotherapeutic
agents. However, DNA mismatch repair (MMR)-deﬁcient cancer
cells are resistant to most conventional chemotherapeutic agents.
Here we have identiﬁed baicalein as a small molecule that
selectively kills MutSa-deﬁcient cancer cells. Baicalein binds preferentially to mismatched DNA and induces a DNA damage
response in a MMR-dependent manner. In MutSa-proﬁcient cells,
baicalein binds to MutSa to dissociate CHK2 from MutSa leading

to S-phase arrest and cell survival. In contrast, continued replication in the presence of baicalein in MutSa-deﬁcient cells results
in a high number of DNA double-strand breaks and ultimately
leads to apoptosis. Consistently, baicalein speciﬁcally shrinks
MutSa-deﬁcient xenograft tumors and inhibits the growth of
AOM-DSS–induced colon tumors in colon-speciﬁc MSH2 knockout mice. Collectively, baicalein offers the potential of an
improved treatment option for patients with tumors with a DNA

Introduction

precise mechanism by which MMR proteins regulate the cell
cycle is not clearly understood.
Germline loss-of-function mutations in genes involved in the
DNA MMR pathway cause the autosomal dominant Lynch syndrome, also known as hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer
(HNPCC). Individuals with Lynch syndrome have an 80% risk of
developing colorectal cancer in their lifetime, with the average age
of onset being 45 years (6). Lynch syndrome accounts for approximately 2% of all colorectal cancers diagnosed each year (7), and
patients with Lynch syndrome are at an increased risk of developing a range of other tumor types, including gastric, endometrial,
ovarian, and bladder cancers (8–10). Although some standard
chemotherapeutic regiments as well as immunotherapy PD-1
may be beneﬁcial to Lynch syndrome patients (11–13), the
underlying mechanisms of these treatment options for Lynch
syndrome tumors are not clear. Some studies have also pointed
out that MMR-deﬁcient cells may be resistant to the standard
chemotherapeutic regimens for colorectal cancer (14).
We have recently developed an ATAD5 (ATPase family AAA
domain containing protein 5)-luciferase assay that allows highthroughput screening for potential chemotherapeutic compounds that act by inducing DNA replication stress or DNA
damage. In this assay, the stabilization of the ATAD5-luciferase
protein, which is measured by an increase in luciferase activity,
serves as a biomarker of DNA replication stress or DNA damage
(15). Using the ATAD5-luciferase assay, we screened 344,385
small molecules from the NIH Molecular Library Probe production Centers Network (MLPCN) collection, and selected 289
compounds that induced an increase in luciferase activity, indicating that they caused DNA damage. Hypothesizing that these
compounds could provide a better treatment option for Lynch
syndrome tumors, we tested the ability of the compounds to
selectively kill cells with mutations in the MSH2 gene. From this
screen, we identiﬁed baicalein as a small molecule capable of

The DNA mismatch repair (MMR) pathway maintains genome
stability by removing base–base mismatches and insertion/deletion loops that arise during DNA replication or as a result of DNA
damage (1, 2). These DNA lesions are recognized by MutSa
(a heterodimer of MSH2/MSH6) or MutSb (a heterodimer of
MSH2/MSH3), which recruit the MutLa (MLH1/PMS2) or MutLb
(MLH1/PMS1) proteins. The MutS/MutL complex then loads
exonuclease I to degrade the strand containing the mispaired
nucleotide, and the resulting gap is ﬁlled in by polymerase d (3, 4).
The MMR proteins can also affect cell-cycle control and apoptosis
in response to certain types of DNA damage (4, 5). However, the

inducing apoptosis in MSH2-deﬁcient cells both in vitro and
in vivo. Baicalein is a ﬂavone derived from the roots of Scutellaria
baicalensis and Scutellaria lateriﬂora. Previously, baicalein was used
in some Asian countries as an herbal supplement to enhance liver
health. In the recent years, increasing studies of baicalein have
proceeded on many human disease-related areas, such as cancer
and diabetes (16–20). Although baicalein has previously been
reported to have antitumor activities (18, 19, 21), this article
identiﬁes a novel mechanism of action for baicalein in which the
compound acts on the MutSa/CHK2/ATM pathway as well as
preferentially binds to the mismatched DNA.

Materials and Methods
Compounds
Baicalein, netropsin, colochicine, CHK2 inhibitor hydrate
(2-(4-(4-Chlorophenoxy)phenyl)-1H-benzimidazole-5-carboxamide hydrate), azoxymethane (AOM), and dextran sodium
sulfate (DSS; MW 40,000–50,000) were purchased from SigmaAldrich and USB Affymetrix, respectively.
Control and baicalein-supplemented diets
All diets were made by Harlan Laboratories using baicalein
purchased from Sigma. The control mice were fed a global 18%
protein rodent diet, and the experimental group was fed a global
18% protein rodent diet containing 0.05% baicalein.
Cell culture
HEC59, HEC59-2, LoVo [gift from Dr. Peggy Hsieh's (NIH)
laboratory], HeLa, HEK293T [gift from Dr. Pamela Schwartzberg's
(NIH) laboratory], and MRC5 [gift from Dr. Roger Woodgate's
(NIH) laboratory] cells were cultured in DMEM þ GlutaMAX
(Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FBS (Hyclone Laboratories)
and 50 U/mL penicillin and 50 mg/mL streptomycin (Invitrogen).
HEC59-2 cells were also maintained in 400 mg/mL G418 (Invitrogen). HT-29 cells (purchased from ATCC) were cultured in
McCoy 5A medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FBS
and 50 U/mL penicillin and 50 mg/mL streptomycin (Invitrogen).
All cells were maintained at 37 C under a humidiﬁed atmosphere
and 5% CO2. To authenticate cells used in the study, we frequently
checked the expression of DNA repair proteins, especially MMRrelated proteins, to make sure cells used in the study did (HEC592, HeLa, MRC5, HEK293T, HCT116-3) or did not (HEC59,
HCT116, LoVo) express proteins having mutations. In addition,
we checked the morphology of cell lines with microscopy to make
sure they did not change their original shapes. We checked all cells
for mycoplasma to make sure that there was no contamination.
Finally, we checked chromosome numbers by karyotyping of cell
lines used to make sure cells did not produce abnormal chromosome numbers. We did not use cell lines more than a month from
original frozen stocks in culture to avoid potential accumulation
of unnecessary mutations.
Cell viability assay
Cells were plated in white, solid-bottom 96-well plates at a ﬁnal
density of 15,000 cells/well. After the cells had attached to the
plate, 1:2 dilutions of the indicated compounds were added.
Twenty-four hours after treatment, cell viability was determined
using Cell Titer-Glo (Promega) according to the manufacturer's
protocol. Viability was quantiﬁed on a Fluoroskan Ascent Lumin-

ometer (Thermo Scientiﬁc). Dose–response curves and EC50
values were generated using GraphPad Prism.
Western blot and coimmunoprecipitation
Anti-PARP was purchased from BD Biosciences; anti-caspase
3 and anti-p-CHK2 (Thr68) were purchased from Cell Signaling
Technology; anti-CHK2, anti-ATM, HRP-conjugated-antiPCNA, and anti-MSH2 were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology; anti-MSH2, anti-MSH6, and HRP-conjugated–antib-tubulin were purchased from Abcam; anti-histone H3 was
purchased from Upstate; anti-phospho-histone H2AX was purchased from GeneTex; anti-CDC25A was purchased from
Thermo Scientiﬁc; anti-SHPRH was purchased from Origene;
and anti-digoxigenin was purchased from Roche.
For Western immunoblotting, proteins from cells or mice colon
were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene
diﬂuoride membrane ﬁlter using Bio-Rad mini, midi transfer
packs and Transblot turbo. After incubation with the desired
antibodies, the blots were developed with Pierce ECL plus Western blotting substrate. For coimmunoprecipitation, cells lysed
with the lysis/wash buffer [0.025 mol/L Tris, 0.15 mol/L NaCl,
0.001 mol/L EDTA, 1% NP-40, 5% glycerol, pH 7.4 with Protease
Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche)] for 0.5 hour at 4 C. After incubation
with the desired primary antibody for 18 hours at 4 C via gentle
rocking, immune complexes were captured by mixing with a ﬁnal
concentration of 2.5% protein G Sepharose beads (GE) for 2
hours at 4 C on a rotator. Beads were subsequently washed three
times with the lysis/wash buffer, followed by SDS-PAGE and
immunoblotting analysis after elution by boiling in 2 SDSloading buffer.
Protein preparations
Human wild-type MutSa were expressed in baculovirus and
puriﬁed as described previously (22). SHPRH protein was
expressed in baculovirus and puriﬁed (unpublished data).
Hematoxylin and eosin staining, TUNEL, and IHC
Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining, TUNEL, and IHC were
commercially performed by the Histoserv Company (tumors or
tissues were collected, ﬁxed in formalin, and then were picked up
by Histoserv Company). Detailed procedures can be found on the
company's website (http://www.histoservinc.com/). To quantify
the images, the number of positive signals was manually counted
in multiple ﬁelds of view. The number of total positive signals was
then divided by the number of ﬁelds visualized for counting.

Results
Baicalein selectively kills MutSa-deﬁcient cells
The human endometrial adenocarcinoma cell line HEC59
carrying two different loss-of-function MSH2 nonsense mutations
(23) and HEC59-2 cells, which are HEC59 cells into which
human chromosome 2 was transferred, restoring wild-type MSH2
expression and functional MMR (24), were treated with serial
dilutions of the 289 compounds, and dose–response viability
curves were used to calculate the concentration of each compound
required to induce 50% cell death (EC50). The screen revealed 9
compounds that were at least 2-fold more potent in the HEC59
cells than in the HEC59-2 cells (Fig. 1A). A secondary viability
screen using a luciferase-based ATP assay and a colony formation
assay showed that one of these compounds, baicalein (Fig. 1A

Targeting MMR-Deﬁcient Cancers

viability was determined using CellTiter-Glo. Data are shown as mean  SE. EC50 values in C are 184 mmol/L for HEC59 and 412 mmol/L for HEC59-2. EC50 values
in D are 530 mmol/L for si-NC and 175 mmol/L for si-MSH2. E, HEC59 and HEC59-2 cells were treated with 250 mmol/L baicalein for 72 hours. Total lysate
from these cells was subjected to Western blot analysis.

black dot, B), generated the most reproducible results (Fig. 1C
and Supplementary Fig. S1A). Baicalein treatment resulted in
PARP1 and caspase-3 cleavages in HEC59 cells, but not in the
MMR-proﬁcient HEC59-2 cells (Fig. 1E), indicating that the loss
of viability observed upon MSH2 deﬁciency occurs via apoptosis.
We conﬁrmed the speciﬁcity of baicalein's activity for MMR
deﬁciency by reducing MSH2 protein levels by siRNA in HT29
(colorectal adenocarcinoma) cells and HeLa (cervical cancer) cells
(Fig. 1D and Supplementary Fig. S1B–S1D). Furthermore, we
measured the cell viability of LoVo cell, which is a colorectal
carcinoma cell defective in MSH2. Because of the lack of LoVo WT
cells, we used MMR-proﬁcient MRC5 (human lung ﬁbroblast)
cells and HT29 cells for comparison. Consistent with other cell
viability results, LoVo cells were more sensitive to baicalein than
MRC5 cells and HT29 cells (Supplementary Fig. S1E). In addition,
we tested baicalein in another pair of cell lines, HCT116, which
harbors a homozygous mutation of the MLH1 gene, and HCT1163 cell line, where the transfer of human chromosome 3 into
HCT116 cells restores wild-type MLH1 expression (Supplementary Fig. S1F; ref. 25). Baicalein also exhibited selective sensitivity
on HCT116 cells, which suggests a general activity of baicalein
targeting MMR-deﬁcient cells. In contrast to MMR deﬁciency,
there was no selective killing of other DNA repair–deﬁcient cells
including PARP1, p53, RAD54b, FANCA, FANCG, FANCD2,
ATM, ATR, NBS, Ku70/Rad54, FANCC, XPA, PolB, UBC13, FEN1,
ATG5, Pol h/z, and Rev3 by baicalein (data not shown).
Baicalein-treated HEC59 cells are deﬁcient in CHK2-regulated
S-phase checkpoint arrest
Given the inﬂuence of MutSa on S-phase cell-cycle checkpoint activation (5), we tested the effect of baicalein on cellcycle progression in cells synchronized with hydroxyurea.
We found that baicalein-treated HEC59-2 cells remained
largely in the S-phase of the cell cycle, whereas a large
percentage of baicalein-treated HEC59 cells were able to

progress to the G2–M phase (Fig. 2A). In addition, we monitored DNA replication using an EdU incorporation assay.
Baicalein inhibited DNA replication in MutSa-proﬁcient
HEC59-2 cells, but not in the MutSa-deﬁcient HEC59 cells
(Supplementary Fig. S2A and S2B). We hypothesized that
there would be MMR-dependent checkpoint activation in response to baicalein. Consistent with this hypothesis, we found
an induction of CHK2 phosphorylation and subsequent
CDC25A degradation predominately in baicalein-treated
MutSa-proﬁcient HEC59-2 cells, although baicalein treatment
resulted in similar chromatin-bound monoubiquitylated
PCNA regardless of MMR activity (Fig. 2B). Low levels of
CHK2 phosphorylation were also observed in baicalein-treated HEC59 cells, most likely due to the MutSa-independent
activity of ATM. Consistent with the activation of CHK2 by
baicalein in a MutSa-dependent manner, the MutSa-proﬁcient cells became sensitive to baicalein after treatment with
a CHK2 inhibitor (Fig. 2C).
Baicalein binds to MutSa
It has been demonstrated that MutSa interacts with CHK2,
and that it forms a complex with ATM (5, 26). We hypothesized
that baicalein would affect the interaction between MutSa and
CHK2/ATM that is required for cell-cycle arrest. In MutSaproﬁcient HEC59-2 cells, immunoprecipitation of MutSa with
a MSH6 antibody also pulled down ATM and CHK2 (Fig. 3A).
Similarly, immunoprecipitation of CHK2 coprecipitated MutSa
and ATM (Fig. 3B). Baicalein treatment inhibited the interaction
between MutSa and CHK2/ATM (Fig. 3A and B). The interactions were mediated by MutSa, because cells not expressing
MSH2 (either by mutation or silencing by siRNA) had significantly reduced interactions between MutSa and CHK2/ATM
(Fig. 3A and B and Supplementary Fig. S3A) and between ATM
and CHK2 (Fig. 3B and Supplementary Fig. S3A). The MutSa/
CHK2/ATM interactions were not mediated through DNA

hydroxyurea (HU) and then released into fresh media containing nocodazole plus DMSO or 100 mmol/L baicalein. B, HEC59 and HEC59-2 cells were treated
with 100 mmol/L baicalein for 24 hours. Total lysate from the cells was subjected to Western blot analysis for CHK2, CDC25A, and tubulin. Chromatin-bound lysate
from the cells was subjected to Western blot analysis for PCNA and histone H3. C, HEC59-2 cells were treated with 125 mmol/L baicalein with or without CHK2
inhibitor (10 mmol/L) for 24 hours. Cell viability was determined using CellTiter-Glo. Data are shown as mean  SE.   , P < 0.01 as determined by two-tailed

because the interactions between proteins remained intact even
when cell extracts were pretreated with ethidium bromide (EB),
which disrupts the interaction between proteins and DNA
(Supplementary Fig. S3B). Thus, MutSa, acting as a docking
platform for ATM and CHK2 is dissociated from ATM and
CHK2 by baicalein, which in turn, activates the S-phase checkpoint through CHK2 phosphorylation by ATM. To study the
dynamics of the interaction among these proteins, we used
siRNA targeting CHK2 or ATM. The absence of CHK2 had little
effect on the interaction between MutSa and ATM in untreated
cells and in cells treated with baicalein, and absence of ATM also
had little effect on the interaction between MutSa and CHK2 in
untreated cells and in cells treated with baicalein (Supplementary Fig. S3C). In addition, we used a double-thymidine block to
synchronize HeLa cells to compare the interaction pattern in
different cell-cycle phases. Immunoprecipitation of MSH6
coprecipitated a similar amount of ATM or CHK2 in both
G1–S and G2 phases, suggesting the interaction patterns are
similar in G1–S and G2 (Supplementary Fig. S3D).
The baicalein-induced dissociation of MutSa from CHK2/ATM
suggested that baicalein could directly bind to MutSa and inhibit
its interaction with CHK2/ATM. To test this hypothesis, we used
the drug afﬁnity responsive target stability (DARTS) assay that
detects the interaction between the target protein and a small
molecule by measuring resistance to proteolysis (Supplementary
Fig. S4A; refs. 27, 28). As a control, we used SHPRH, a nuclear
protein with a molecular weight similar to MSH6. DARTS analysis
revealed that baicalein protects MutSa, but not SHPRH, from
degradation by pronase, suggesting that MutSa interacts with
baicalein (Supplementary Fig. S4B and S4C). To conﬁrm the
direct interaction, biotin-tagged baicalein (baicalein-biotin; Supplementary Fig. S4D), which was shown to be as active in MMRdependent cell viability assays as the untagged molecule (Supplementary Fig. S4E), was incubated with MutSa or SHPRH and
pulled down with streptavidin beads. MutSa, but not SHPRH, was
coprecipitated, suggesting that baicalein directly binds to MutSa
(Fig. 3C). In addition, we used a Biacore assay to measure the

4186 Cancer Res; 76(14) July 15, 2016

interaction between baicalein and MutSa as well as baicalein and
SHPRH, and calculate the Kd between baicalein and MutSa, which
was about 32.2 mmol/L. In contrast, SHPRH did not show interaction with baicalein (Supplementary Fig. S4F and S4G). Collectively, these data suggest that baicalein directly binds to MutSa,
which in turn dissociates CHK2/ATM from MutSa.
Baicalein preferentially binds to mismatched DNA
As CHK2 activation is often linked to DNA double-strand break
(DSB) damage, we hypothesized that baicalein would generate
DSBs, and that MutSa deﬁciency would further increase the level
of DSBs due to the absence of proper checkpoint activation
through CHK2. Consistent with the hypothesis, pulsed-ﬁeld gel
electrophoresis (PFGE) revealed that there were more DSBs produced in MutSa-mutant cells than wild-type cells after baicalein
treatment (Fig. 4A and B). To determine whether baicalein intercalates in DNA, we conducted an assay that measures the decrease
in ﬂuorescence due to the displacement of DNA-bound EB by a
DNA-binding compound (29). Similar to netropsin, which is
known to bind to the minor groove of DNA, but in contrast to
colchicine, which does not interact with DNA, the incubation of
baicalein with EB-bound DNA resulted in a dose-dependent
decrease in ﬂuorescence (Supplementary Fig. S5A). However,
baicalein does not form interstrand crosslinks as denatured baicalein-bound DNA only produced single-stranded DNA (Supplementary Fig. S5B). To determine whether baicalein has a preference for binding to matched or mismatched double-stranded
DNA, we compared one dimensional proton NMR spectra of
both free and baicalein-bound matched and mismatched DNA.
Baicalein resulted in much higher chemical shift perturbation of
mismatched DNA compared with the matched DNA (Fig. 4C).
The resonances of the imino group generated by the mismatched
bases disappeared upon baicalein binding, suggesting that baicalein binds to the mismatched bases. Consistently, baicalein–
biotin preferentially pulled down mismatched DNA (Supplementary Fig. S5C). In addition, we used a Biacore assay to measure the
interaction between baicalein and DNA, and calculate the Kd

matched DNA and about 31.7 mmol/L for mismatched DNA
(Supplementary Fig. S5D). To elucidate how baicalein interacts
with both MutSa and mismatched DNA, mismatched DNA and
baicalein–biotin were mixed together and baicalein was pulled
down with streptavidin beads. The double bindings were examined separately (Supplementary Fig. S5E and S5F), and revealed

that baicalein interacts with both mismatched DNA and MutSa.
Interestingly, the binding of baicalein to mismatched DNA
reduced the interaction of MutSa with mismatched DNA (Supplementary Fig. S5G). Consistently, the dose-dependent interaction between MutSa and mismatched DNA measured by the
biacore assay (Supplementary Fig. S5H) was blocked when baicalein was preincubated with MutSa (Supplementary Fig. S5I).
Such inhibition of the interaction between MutSa and mismatched DNA by baicalein was baicalein dose dependent (Supplementary Fig. S5J). Collectively, these data indicate that baicalein binds to mismatched DNA and MutSa, which releases MutSa
from DNA and dissociates it from CHK2/ATM.
We hypothesized that the baicalein-induced DSBs would be
generated by endonuclease(s). We silenced the expression of
APE1, XPF, XPG, and MUS81 endonucleases with siRNA to
determine their role in DSB formation upon baicalein treatment.
Only XPF expression was required for baicalein-induced H2AX
phosphorylation (g-H2AX) in the MMR-deﬁcient HEC59 cells
(Fig. 5A). Moreover, baicalein-induced cell death in HEC59 cells
was partially rescued by silencing XPF expression (Fig. 5B). To
further conﬁrm this observation, we transfected HT29 cells with
negative control siRNA, siRNA targeting MSH2, and/or siRNA
targeting XPF. Upon the silencing of XPF expression, baicaleininduced g-H2AX was reduced in MSH2-deﬁcient HT29 cells
(Supplementary Fig. S6A). In addition, baicalein-induced cell
death was rescued by silencing XPF expression in MSH2-deﬁcient
HT29 cells (Supplementary Fig. S6B).
Baicalein reduces the size of tumors formed by
MutSa-deﬁcient cells
MutSa-deﬁcient cancer cells are not sensitive to radiation,
alkylating agents, or most chemotherapeutic treatments (14).
Thus, we investigated whether baicalein would be an improved
chemotherapy option for MutSa-deﬁcient tumors. We generated
xenograft tumors with MutSa-deﬁcient HEC59 cells and MMRproﬁcient HT29 cells in nude mice. When tumors grew to approximately 1 cm, matrix-driven delivery pellets were implanted (day
0) to deliver baicalein at a constant dose for two weeks (Fig. 6A
and Supplementary Fig. S7A–S7C). During this process, the body
weights of these mice were not signiﬁcantly changed in either the

S7F). Apoptotic cell death and DNA damage, as measured by the
TUNEL assay and by g-H2AX, respectively, were induced approximately 2-fold by baicalein in MutSa-deﬁcient HEC59–xenografted tumors (Fig. 6D–F). However, CHK2 phosphorylation
was not changed by baicalein (Fig. 6D and G). Baicalein had no
signiﬁcant effect on the growth of MutSa-expressing HT29-xenografted tumors (Fig. 6C and Supplementary Fig. S7G) and there
was no induction of the TUNEL signal or g-H2AX (Fig. 6H–J).
Consistent with in vitro results, CHK2 phosphorylation was
induced about 2-fold by baicalein in MutSa-expressing HT29–
xenografted tumors (Fig. 6H and K). Thus, baicalein can selectively inhibit the growth of MutSa-deﬁcient tumors in vivo.
To assess the effect of baicalein on tumor size over the course of
time, we repeated the xenograft experiment, implanting the pellets for one week or two weeks before harvest. The tumor size
before implantation was similar in all treatment groups as shown
in Supplementary Fig. S8A and the body weights of the mice in
both the placebo- and baicalein-treated groups remained relatively constant throughout the study (Supplementary Fig. S8B).
Again, baicalein signiﬁcantly shrank the MutSa-deﬁcient xenografted HEC59 tumors in a time-dependent manner (Supplementary Fig. S8C and S8D).
To further conﬁrm the ability of baicalein to shrink MSH2deﬁcient tumors in vivo, we used another MSH2-deﬁcient colorectal carcinoma cell line, LoVo. The tumor size before implantation was similar in all treatment groups (Supplementary Fig.
S9A) and the body weight of the mice did not change during the
course of the study (Supplementary Fig. S9B). Consistent with
what we observed with the HEC59 tumors, baicalein signiﬁcantly
shrank the MutSa-deﬁcient LoVo tumors (Supplementary Fig.
S9C and S9D).
Baicalein prevents the growth of AOM-DSS–induced colon
tumors in Msh2LoxP/LoxPVilCre mice
Msh2LoxP/LoxPVilCre mice display a strong predisposition to
intestinal cancers at 10 months of age (30) making them a good
model to study the effects of baicalein treatment on the growth of

4188 Cancer Res; 76(14) July 15, 2016

Msh2-deﬁcient tumors in the colon (Supplementary Fig. S10A
and S10B). AOM and DSS can be used to accelerate and enhance
the onset of colon tumors in Msh2 knockout mice (31). To study
the effect of baicalein on the chronic-AOM-DSS–induced colon
tumors, male and female Msh2LoxP/LoxPVilCre mice were fed a
control or baicalein-supplemented diet for 4 weeks and then
treated with AOM and DSS as shown in Supplementary Fig.
S10C. Both male and female mice in the baicalein-supplemented
diet group gained slightly more weight than mice in the control
diet group (Supplementary Fig. S10D and S10E). In male mice,
the number of tumors in the baicalein-supplemented diet group
was signiﬁcantly less than that in control diet group (Fig. 7A and C
and Supplementary Fig. S10F). The female mice also showed a
similar trend toward reduced tumor formation when fed baicalein-containing diet (Figs. 7B and C and Supplementary Fig.
S10F). To study the role of baicalein on the acute-AOM-DSS–
induced colon tumors, female Msh2LoxP/LoxPVilCre mice were fed a
control or baicalein-supplemented diet for 4 weeks and then
treated with AOM and DSS as shown in Supplementary Fig.
S11A. The mice in the baicalein-supplemented diet group gained
slightly more weight than mice in the control diet group (Supplementary Fig. S11B). The colon condition of both diet groups is
shown in Supplementary Fig. S11C. The mice showed a trend
toward reduced tumor formation when fed a baicalein-containing
diet, compared with the control diet group (Supplementary Fig.
S11D and S11E). Male Msh2LoxP/LoxPVilCre mice were fed a control
or baicalein-supplemented diet for 4 weeks and then treated with
AOM and DSS as shown in Supplementary Fig. S11F. The mice in
the baicalein-supplemented diet group gained slightly more
weight than mice in control diet group (Supplementary Fig.
S11G). The colon condition of both diet groups is shown in
Supplementary Fig. S11H. The number of tumors in the baicaleinsupplemented diet group was signiﬁcantly less than that in
control diet group (Supplementary Fig. S11I and S11J).
To further evaluate the effect of baicalein on the AOM-DSS–
induced colon tumors, WT male mice were fed a control or
baicalein-supplemented diet for 4 weeks and then treated with
AOM and DSS as shown in Supplementary Fig. S12A. The mice in
baicalein-supplemented diet group gained slightly more weight
than mice in control diet group (Supplementary Fig. S12B). The
number of severe colon tumors in the WT mice was lower
compared with Msh2LoxP/LoxPVilCre mice as indicated by the lack
of tumors more than 2 mm in WT mice. In the WT mice, there was
not much difference in the number of tumors between the two
groups (Supplementary Fig. S12C–S12E).

Discussion
In this article, we provide a molecular mechanism for the
activation of the MutSa-dependent damage checkpoint that
allows for cell survival in the presence of baicalein, as well as an
alternative pathway explaining the baicalein-induced cell death
observed in the absence of MutSa both in vitro and in vivo.
Baicalein simultaneously binds directly to mismatched DNA and
to MutSa. The interaction between baicalein and MutSa dissociates MutSa from CHK2, resulting in the activation of CHK2 by
ATM. The activated checkpoint allows the DNA repair machinery
to remove damage, resulting in cell survival. In the absence of
MutSa, baicalein-bound mismatched DNA is converted to DSBs
by XPF more frequently and without activation of CHK2, resulting
in cell death (Supplementary Fig. S13). Although MutSa has

previously been implicated in damage signaling following DNA
methylation and exposure to ionizing radiation (5, 32), our data
provide the ﬁrst direct evidence that MutSa plays an important
role in signaling DSBs to the checkpoint machinery.
Baicalein has been reported to have some anti-inﬂammatory
(33) and antiproliferative (16) effects. Given these properties, it is
no surprise that baicalein previously has been reported to kill
several different cancer cell types, including colon cancer. Many
mechanisms of action have been proposed to explain these effects,
including reduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS), attenuation
of NFkB signaling, suppression of COX-2 gene expression, upregulation of death receptor 5, and inhibition of cell-cycle checkpoints (18, 19, 21). Although the current study also provides
strong evidence that the regulation of cell-cycle progression is
involved in the baicalein-induced death of MutSa-deﬁcient cells,
our study differs from previous reports describing the antitumor
effects of baicalein in that it implicates CHK2/ATM–mediated
G2–M phase arrest. Additional studies in our laboratory have
shown a decrease in ROS following treatment with the concentrations of baicalein used in this article (data not shown). However, further studies are needed to investigate the contribution of
baicalein's antioxidant activity, as well as the potential contributions of NFkB, COX-2, and death receptor 5, in the baicaleininduced death of MutSa-deﬁcient cells.
Although baicalein is not the only small molecule that has been
reported to kill MutSa-deﬁcient cancer cells in vitro, baicalein
offers several advantages over other MSH2-mutant–sensitizing
drugs such as methotrexate (34) and psoralen (35). A common
critique of therapeutic strategies that target DNA repair deﬁciencies is that drugs that cause DNA damage often increase malignancy in the long term by inducing mutation rates. Indeed,
methotrexate tested positive in many of the standard genotoxicity
assays (Chemical Carcinogenesis Research Information System
http://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov/cgi-bin/sis/htmlgen?CCRIS), and the
UV radiation required to activate psoralen is also a mutagen.
Baicalein, on the other hand, does not increase mutagenesis in
HEK293T due to the ability of the DNA repair polymerase Polh to
bypass baicalein-induced lesions in an error-free manner (15).
However, due to MutSa interaction of baicalein, it is possible that
baicalein would affect MMR pathway for reducing mutagenesis. In

4190 Cancer Res; 76(14) July 15, 2016

addition, whereas the majority of chemotherapeutic agents have
no clear targets, here we showed that baicalein targets both MutSa
and mismatched DNA, providing the molecular mechanisms by
which baicalein would target the MMR-deﬁcient tumor population and serve as a personalized cancer therapy. Although the
EC50 values of baicalein in MutSa-deﬁcient cancer cells are
within the range of those reported for other types of cancers
(10–264 mmol/L; ref. 21), they far exceed the nanomolar values
required for the successful use of baicalein as a human therapeutic. In addition, high Kd of baicalein for mismatched DNA also
raises the possibility of side and off-target effects. Thus, future
studies will involve collaborations with structural biologists and
synthetic chemists to optimize the structure of this lead compound and improve its potency.
