Abstract
The androgen receptor (AR) directs diverse biological processes through interaction with coregulators such as AR
trapped clone-27 (ART-27). Our results show that ART-27 is
recruited to AR-binding sites by chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis. In addition, the effect of ART-27 on genomewide transcription was examined. The studies indicate that
loss of ART-27 enhances expression of many androgenregulated genes, suggesting that ART-27 inhibits gene expression. Surprisingly, classes of genes that are up-regulated upon
ART-27 depletion include regulators of DNA damage checkpoint and cell cycle progression, suggesting that ART-27
functions to keep expression levels of these genes low.
Consistent with this idea, stable reduction of ART-27 by
short-hairpin RNA enhances LNCaP cell proliferation compared with control cells. The effect of ART-27 loss was also
examined in response to the antiandrogen bicalutamide.
Unexpectedly, cells treated with ART-27 siRNA no longer
exhibited gene repression in response to bicalutamide. To
examine ART-27 loss in prostate cancer progression, immunohistochemistry was conducted on a tissue array containing
samples from primary tumors of individuals who were
clinically followed and later shown to have either recurrent
or nonrecurrent disease. Comparison of ART-27 and AR
staining indicated that nuclear ART-27 expression was lost
in the majority of AR-positive recurrent prostate cancers. Our
studies show that reduction of ART-27 protein levels in
prostate cancer may facilitate antiandrogen-resistant disease.

Introduction
At its early stages, prostate cancer is an androgen-dependent
disease. Hormone-based therapy, which involves the use of
antiandrogens, induces tumor regression but fails to prevent
biochemical recurrence (1). In fact, antiandrogen therapy is
thought to trigger and/or select for cancer cells with unusual
capabilities that enable cell survival and metastasis at subphysiologic androgen concentrations (1–5). Antiandrogen-resistant can-

cer cells often show increased expression of the androgen receptor
(AR)—a nuclear receptor family member that functions as an
androgen-sensitive transcription factor (3). Upon activation, AR
binds androgen response elements (ARE) of its target genes and
coordinates recruitment of its coregulators at these AREs (6). AR
coregulators modulate physiologic androgen response, and select
AR coregulators facilitate AR-mediated prostate cancer cell
proliferation (7–11).
Our research group identified AR trapped clone-27 (ART-27/
UXT), as a coregulator that binds the AR NH2 terminus and
enhances androgen-stimulated transcription (12, 13). The primary
sequence of ART-27 is conserved throughout evolution from
worms to humans and its predicted protein structure is
homologous to the prefoldin-a family of chaperones. ART-27 also
associates with at least one large, multiprotein complex whose
constituents modulate transcription, genomic stability, apoptosis,
and cell transformation (12, 14–20). ART-27 has also been
described as a suppressor of cell transformation, and a nuclear
factor-nB coregulator (21, 22).
In the prostate, ART-27 expression is restricted to epithelial cells
(13). In vivo, its cell-specific expression pattern correlates with
activation of cyclic AMP–response element binding protein, a
transcription factor that is recruited to the ART-27 promoter and is
required for epidermal growth factor-induced expression of ART-27
(23). However, ART-27 expression is often reduced in prostate
cancer, and ART-27 overexpression suppresses cell proliferation in
AR-dependent prostate cancer (LNCaP) cells, suggesting that ART27 plays a tumor suppressor role in the prostate (13). Yet, the
mechanism of ART-27 function in AR-mediated transcription is
unclear. The effect of ART-27 on AR target gene expression has
been previously examined in cell-based reporter gene assays. In this
study, ART-27 recruitment to endogenous genes is examined, and
the genome-wide effect of ART-27 on AR target gene expression is
explored.

expression of androgen-regulated genes.
A, outline of the procedure used to
examine androgen response in control and
ART-27–depleted LNCaP cells. Briefly,
LNCaP cells were steroid deprived
for 72 h. During this period, the cells were
transfected with control siRNA (siControl )
or ART-27 siRNA (siART-27 ), and allowed
to recover in steroid-deprived media. The
cells were then stimulated with ethanol
vehicle or R1881 for 18 h. Total RNA was
isolated and analyzed by real-time,
Q-PCR. For genome-wide studies,
RNA was hybridized to Affymetrix
Gene Chips and processed. B, AR and

R1881 for 17 h. The cells were fixed, and chromatin was prepared, sheared,
and used in chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay performed as
previously described (23, 24), with some modifications. Precleared
chromatin was incubated with anti–ART-27, or anti-AR antibodies
overnight at 4jC. Quantitative PCR (Q-PCR) was performed on precipitated
DNA, and relative enrichment is shown as a percentage of the input. The
ChIP primers used for prostate-specific antigen (PSA) are previously
described (25). The other primers used are provided in the Supplementary
Materials and Methods section.
RNA-interference. Nonsilencing (control), ART-27 (SMARTpool), and AR
siRNA were purchased from Dharmacon. LNCaP cells incubated overnight
in cs media were transfected in Opti-MEM media (Invitrogen) using 100
nmol/L of each siRNA, and Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to
manufacturer’s protocol. After 4 h, the cells were allowed to recover
overnight in cs media.
Q-PCR. Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Inc.).
Total RNA was reverse transcribed at 55jC for 1 h, using Superscript III
reverse transcriptase and oligo-(dT)20 primers (Invitrogen). Real-time
PCR was performed using gene-specific primers (Supplementary
Materials & Methods) and 2 SYBR green Taq-ready mix (SigmaAldrich) as previously described (23). Data were analyzed by the DDCT
method using RPL19 as a control gene, and calibrated to naive samples,
which were arbitrarily set to 1 (26). The same results were obtained
using glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) as a control
gene.
cDNA microarray analysis. Total RNA was processed, hybridized, and
analyzed at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering genomics core facility, using
HG_U133A 2.0 gene chips (Affymetrix). Androgen-regulated genes in each
condition were determined as previously described using Genespring

software (Agilent Technologies) and a 2-fold change threshold (27). The
NetAffx online tool7 was used to sort androgen-regulated genes sets
identified in each condition (28). L2L online microarray data analysis tool8
was used to analyze the gene sets based on gene ontology classifications
(29). The data discussed in this publication have been deposited in National
Center for Biotechnology Information’s Gene Expression Omnibus (Nwachukwu and colleagues, 2009) and are accessible through GEO Series
accession number GSE14043.9
Thymidine-incorporation. After transfection, steroid-deprived LNCaP
cells were seeded (4  104 cells per well) onto fibronectin-coated 24-well
plates and incubated in cs media plus ethanol vehicle or 0.1 Amol/L
bicalutamide at 37jC. The next day, 2 ACi of [3H]-Thymidine (Sigma) were
added to each well and incubated with the cells for 1 h at 37jC. The cells
were subsequently placed on ice, washed with cold PBS, and fixed by
incubation in cold methanol for 10 min on ice. The cells were then washed
with 10% trichloroacetic acid, and solubilized in 0.5 mL of prewarmed 1%
SDS in 0.3 N NaOH at 37jC for 2 h before scintillation counting.
Tissue array analysis. Arrays containing tissue specimens from
individuals, who had undergone radical prostatectomy at Memorial Sloan
Kettering Cancer Center between 1985 and 2003, were created with the
approval of the Institutional Review Board of Memorial Sloan Kettering
Cancer Center. Three representative tissue cores 0.6 mm in diameter were
extracted from each specimen and mounted in paraffin blocks. Two
individuals (J.C.N. and S.K.L.) blindly scored the tissue array based on

staining intensity and proportion of positively stained cells. Each specimen
was scored for intensity (0–3) and proportion of positively stained cells
(0–5) in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, such that every sample has 4
scores. For intensity scores, negative staining was scored between 0 and 1.
Weak but convincing stain was scored 1.5, moderate staining was typically
scored 2, and strong staining was scored 3. The proportion of stained cells
was scored as follows: 0, no positive cells; 1, 1 in 100 positive cells; 2, 1 in 10
positive cells; 3, one-third positive cells; 4, two-thirds positive cells; and 5, all
positive cells. AR staining was used as a positive control for tissue integrity
because AR staining is so robust in prostate. Thus, only AR-positive samples
were included in the analysis. Samples that scored at or above 1.5
(intensity); 2 (proportion) were considered positive. The probability
(P value) associated with a Student’s t test was calculated by designating
positive samples ‘‘1’’ and negative samples ‘‘0.’’ Differences with P values of
<0.05 were considered significant.

Results
ART-27 depletion alters androgen-regulated gene expression. To determine the role of ART-27 in AR-mediated transcription in LNCaP cells, the effect of ART-27 depletion on expression of
the androgen-regulated genes PSA and NK3 homeobox 1 (NKX3-1),
was examined. Steroid-deprived LNCaP cells were transfected with
nonsilencing (control) or ART-27–silencing (siART-27) smallinterfering RNA. Cells were treated with ethanol vehicle or R1881
for 18 hours. ART-27 depletion was confirmed by Q-PCR (Fig. 1)
and Western blot analysis (Fig. 1B). AR expression was largely
unaffected (Fig. 1B). To show ART-27 siRNA specificity, cells were

also treated with the four individual oligonucleotide duplexes that
compose the SMARTpool. The results indicated that each
separately diminished ART-27 expression, whereas nonspecific
siRNA had no effect (data not shown).
After siRNA treatment, Q-PCR was conducted to compare PSA
and NKX3-1 mRNA expression. ART-27 depletion increased PSA
expression in steroid-deprived cells treated with ethanol vehicle or
0.01, 0.1, or 1 nmol/L of R1881 (Fig. 1C; compare white versus black
bars), suggesting that ART-27 inhibits gene expression. Examination of NKX3-1 mRNA levels upon treatment with ART-27 siRNA
indicates a modest increase in gene expression in the presence of
vehicle alone (Fig. 1C, inset). However, ART-27 depletion increased
expression of the NKX3-1 transcript at every concentration tested
and almost 10-fold above cells treated with control siRNA at 0.01
nmol/L R1881 (Fig. 1C). These findings suggest that ART-27 inhibits
AR-mediated gene expression over a wide range of androgen
concentrations with more prevalent and uniform effects at low
doses of androgen.
Whereas the effect of loss of ART-27 on PSA and NKX3-1 is
shown above, the broader effect of ART-27 on AR-regulated genes
is not known. To evaluate the genome-wide effect of ART-27 on
androgen-regulated gene expression, steroid-deprived LNCaP cells
were transfected with control or ART-27 siRNA and treated with
ethanol or 10 nmol/L R1881 (Fig. 1A). RNA isolated from duplicate
transfectants was then processed, hybridized to Affymetrix
GeneChip microarrays (HG-U133A_2), and analyzed. The results
from the duplicate samples were highly similar.

ART-27 Inhibits AR Target Genes

Figure 3. AR mediates the increase in
gene expression observed upon
ART-27 depletion. A, LNCaP cells were
transfected with control siRNA or ART-27
siRNA and/or AR siRNA as indicated and
steroid deprived for 72 h. Total RNA was
isolated and analyzed by Q-PCR for the
indicated genes. The mRNA levels are
shown relative to the naive treatment,
which were arbitrarily set to 1 for each
gene. Data shown is the average of three
independent experiments. B, LNCaP cells
were transfected with control siRNA ( ),
siART-27, and/or AR siRNA as indicated
and steroid deprived for 72 h. Whole
cell extracts were analyzed by Western
blot using anti-AR, and anti–ART-27
antibodies. Anti-ERK antibody was used
as a loading control.

To identify androgen-regulated genes, comparisons between
vehicle- and R1881-treated cells were performed separately for
control and ART-27–depleted cells using GeneSpring software. A
total of 651 androgen-induced (Supplementary Table S1A) and 517
androgen-repressed genes (Supplementary Table S1B ) were
detected. To identify genes that were dependent on ART-27 for
androgen regulation, the set of androgen-regulated probes detected
in ART-27–depleted cells was subtracted from those detected in
control cells using NetAffx. This procedure revealed 271 androgeninduced and 230 androgen-repressed genes that were differentially
regulated in control versus ART-27–depleted cells.
To estimate the effect of ART-27 loss on androgen-sensitive
transcriptional programs, the L2L algorithm was used to identify
cellular processes enriched by androgen in control and ART27–depleted cells, based on gene ontology classification (29, 30).
The greatest effect of ART-27 loss was observed in the set of 271
androgen-induced genes. L2L analysis identified 24 significantly
enriched (P < 0.01) gene ontology biological processes (GOBP).
Enrichment of 13 of these GOBPs was highly significant (P < 0.001).
Surprisingly, all 13 GOBPs were associated with regulation of cell
proliferation (Supplementary Table S2A). Two of these GOBPs
showed remarkably high fold-enrichment and contained the DNA
integrity/cell cycle checkpoint genes ATR, BRIP1, CCNA2, GTSE1,
CHEK1, HUS1, BUB1, CDC6, and TTK protein kinase (full gene
descriptions are provided in the legends, Supplementary Fig. S2).
Under low steroid conditions, expression of these checkpoint genes

www.aacrjournals.org

was generally higher in ART-27–depleted than in control cells
(Fig. 1D), consistent with the inhibitory effect of ART-27 on gene
expression. Thus, in LNCaP cells, ART-27 unexpectedly seems to
preferentially inhibit expression of genes that regulate DNA
integrity and the cell cycle.
NetAffx analysis also identified 380 androgen-induced genes that
were induced in both control siRNA and ART-27 siRNA-treated
cells, indicating that they do not require ART-27 for induction by
androgen. Groups of genes that were androgen induced in an ART27–independent manner include many genes that play a role in
normal metabolic processes of prostate epithelial cells (Supplementary Table S2B). This includes genes associated with production of prostatic secretory fluid and processes such as cholesterol
and lipid metabolism, polyamine biosynthesis, and vesicle-mediated
protein trafficking and secretion (31). These results suggest that
ART-27 is not required for androgen regulation of a broad
spectrum of transcriptional programs such as those that direct
hemostasis and prostatic secretory fluid production.
The set of androgen-repressed genes detected in this study was
diverse and did not easily stratify into functional groups. Within
the set of 287 genes that were androgen repressed in an ART27–insensitive manner, steroid metabolic process was the only
GOBP significantly enriched (P < 0.01). L2L analysis of the set of
230 androgen-repressed genes that were ART-27 sensitive revealed
significant enrichment (P < 0.01) of only two GOBPs: Cyclic
nucleotide metabolism, which contained 4 genes (NPR2, ADCY7,

RORA, PDE4D), and Positive regulation of cell adhesion which
contained 2 genes (CX3CL1 and VAV3). Thus, ART-27 loss may also
affect cellular processes controlled by androgen-repressed genes.
Loss of ART-27 enhances AR target gene expression. To verify
the gene array results described above, regulation of genes selected
from the microarray analysis was examined by Q-PCR (Supplementary Fig. S1). Genes identified on the array as being androgen
responsive are indeed regulated by R1881, and this includes
androgen-repressed genes such as ENO2 and TLR3 (Supplementary
Fig. S1A), and the class of androgen-inducible DNA damage/cell
cycle checkpoint genes identified in Fig. 2 (Supplementary Fig.
S1B). Similar results were obtained using the natural androgen,
dihydrotestosterone (data not shown). As a control, four genes that
were unresponsive to androgen (PRMT1, SRC-1, RUVBL1, and
GAPDH) are also shown (Supplementary Fig. S1C). Descriptions for
genes that were not already discussed (Fig. 1) are provided in the
Supplementary Figure Legends (Supplementary Fig. S1).
To validate the effect of ART-27 depletion on these genes, LNCaP
cells were treated with control or ART-27 siRNA and androgenregulated genes were examined by Q-PCR. Under low steroid
conditions obtained after 72 hours of steroid deprivation, ART-27
depletion via siRNA increased mRNA expression of the androgenregulated genes, including the androgen-repressed genes TLR3 and
ENO2, but not PRMT1, SRC-1, RUVBL1, and GAPDH, which were
not induced by R1881 (Fig. 2A).
The effect of ART-27 ablation on the checkpoint genes identified
above was also examined by Q-PCR. Similar to results in the array,
the mRNA expression of the checkpoint genes was increased upon
ART-27 depletion in steroid-deprived cells (Fig. 2B, compare white
bars for each gene). Similar to PSA (Fig. 1C), expression of most of
these transcripts was minimally affected in cells stimulated with 10
nmol/L R1881 (Fig. 2B, compare black bars for ATR, GSTE1, HUS1,
CDC6, and CCNA2). However, similar to NKX3-1 (Fig. 1C), some
genes (notably BRIP1) also showed increased expression in ART-27
siRNA-treated compared with control cells stimulated with 10
nmol/L R1881. Overall, the results suggest that ART-27 inhibits
expression of androgen-regulated genes including the checkpoint
genes.
To determine whether an increase in mRNA levels in ART27–depleted cells affected checkpoint protein levels, protein expression was also examined in LNCaP cells. ART-27–depleted cells
showed higher Chk1, Bub1, and Cyclin A protein expression,
especially under low steroid conditions obtained after 72 hours of
steroid deprivation (Fig. 2C, compare lanes 1 and 3). This result is
unexpected in that checkpoint proteins such as Chk1, Bub1, and
Cyclin A are typically expressed in proliferating cells, whereas
LNCaP cells generally do not proliferate under these conditions.
Up-regulation of cell cycle checkpoint genes observed in ART27–depleted LNCaP cells suggests that the cells have acquired an
antiandrogen-resistant–like phenotype and may proliferate faster
under low androgen conditions. To determine the effect of ART-27
depletion on LNCaP cell proliferation, the proliferation rates of
cells stably expressing a nonsilencing control short-hairpin RNA or
an ART-27–silencing short-hairpin RNA were compared. Pools of
LNCaP cells expressing an ART-27–silencing short-hairpin RNA
showed a higher proliferation rate than control cells, upon
treatment with either ethanol vehicle or 0.1 nmol/L R1881
(Supplementary Fig. S2).
Consistent with an inhibitory effect of ART-27 on transcription
(Figs. 1 and 2), an ART-27–silencing short-hairpin RNA–expressing
cells showed increased mRNA levels of AR target genes including

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (7). April 1, 2009

PSA, FKBP5, and the checkpoint genes (Supplementary Fig. S2C).
This increase was associated with decreased ART-27 protein
expression but not changes in AR expression in vehicle-treated
cells (Supplementary Fig. S2D, AR , compare lane 1 versus 3);
interestingly, AR protein seemed to be up-regulated by an ART27–silencing short-hairpin RNA in R1881-stimulated cells (Supplementary Fig. S2D, AR , compare lane 2 versus 4). Up-regulation of
AR in response to ART-27 loss was not observed upon transient
treatment with ART-27 siRNA in R1881-treated cells (Fig. 1B, AR,
lane 3 versus 4), suggesting that effects on AR protein levels occur
over a long period of time through an unknown mechanism that
might be similar to up-regulation of AR that is characteristic of
antiandrogen-resistant prostate cancer (3). This result is consistent
with a tumor-suppressor role for ART-27 in the prostate
(13, 21, 32), and supports the idea that ART-27 loss facilitates
antiandrogen resistance in prostate cancer because antiandrogenresistant prostate cancer cells proliferate faster than their

androgen-dependent counterparts, especially under low androgen
conditions (3, 5, 33).
AR is required for increase in gene expression upon ART-27
depletion. To determine whether the increased expression of
androgen-induced genes in ART-27–depleted cells is AR dependent,
the effect of AR siRNA on gene expression in control or ART27–depleted LNCaP cells was examined by Q-PCR, under low
steroid conditions obtained after 72 hours of steroid deprivation
(Fig. 3A). The extent of AR and ART-27 protein depletion is also
shown (Fig. 3B). As expected, in the presence of AR, depletion of
ART-27 results in enhanced levels of mRNA (Fig. 3A, compare white
bars). However, upon AR depletion, most genes show little if any
increase in gene expression upon ART-27 siRNA treatment (Fig. 3A,
compare black bars). Thus, the increase in gene transcription
exhibited upon ART-27 depletion requires the presence of AR. This
implies that ART-27 functions as an AR corepressor.
ART-27 is recruited to AR target genes including checkpoint
genes. Although previous studies have shown that ART-27 binds
AR and effects gene transcription, its recruitment to endogenous
AR target genes has not been shown. Therefore, to determine if the
effect of ART-27 on gene expression could be direct, ChIP assays
examining AR and ART-27 recruitment to established AR target

www.aacrjournals.org

genes and the checkpoint genes were performed. AR and ART-27
recruitment to the well-characterized AREs of PSA and NKX3-1 was
examined (Fig. 4A; refs. 6, 25, 34). Recruitment to an upstream
region previously described as a negative control for AR
recruitment was also assessed (25). Using ChIP coupled with
whole genome-tiling microarray (ChIP-on-Chip) procedure, ARbinding sites of ATR and GTSE1 were identified.10 The positions of
these putative AREs are illustrated (Fig. 4A). AR-binding sites for
the remaining six checkpoint genes are unknown. Therefore, AR
and ART-27 recruitment to ATR and GTSE1 were also examined by
ChIP assay.
In response to R1881, both AR and ART-27 were recruited to PSA,
NKX3-1, ATR, and GTSE1 but not to the upstream region (Fig. 4B).
Under our experimental conditions, AR is rapidly recruited by 30
minutes, whereas robust recruitment of both AR and ART-27 does
not occur until 4 to 17 hours after R1881 stimulation (Supplementary Fig. S3). Furthermore, LNCaP cells treated with AR siRNA show
no recruitment of ART-27 at the PSA, NKX3.1, or ATR gene
promoter/enhancer regions (data not shown), suggesting that the
presence of ART-27 at these sites requires AR. ChIP assay using
preimmune sera did not show recruitment at AREs relative to the
upstream region (Fig. 4B). Therefore, these results indicate that AR
and ART-27 are specifically recruited to target genes.
ART-27 depletion facilitates antiandrogen resistance. Antiandrogen-resistant prostate cancers are characterized by inability
to respond to antiandrogens such as bicalutamide. Although its
exact mechanism of action is still unclear, bicalutamide is thought
to repress gene expression in an AR-dependent manner. Bicalutamide increases recruitment of AR and corepressors to the
promoter-proximal AREs of PSA, inhibits AR-mediated transcription, and suppresses cell proliferation in androgen-dependent but
not antiandrogen-resistant prostate cancer cells (3, 6, 34–36). If
ART-27–depleted cells acquire antiandrogen-resistant status, they
may also resist gene repression by bicalutamide. Therefore the
effect of bicalutamide on gene expression in steroid-deprived
control and ART-27–depleted cells was examined by Q-PCR.
Under low steroid conditions obtained after 72 hours of steroid
deprivation, bicalutamide suppressed the expression of every
androgen-inducible gene tested in cells treated with control siRNA
(Fig. 5A), with the exception of KRT18, which is a luminal epithelial
cell differentiation marker (2). (The fact that bicalutamide
repression occurs in the charcoal stripped media used in these
experiments likely indicates the presence of residual androgen in
our cell culture conditions.) In contrast, bicalutamide repression
was not observed in ART-27–depleted cells (Fig. 5A). In fact,
bicalutamide increased expression of many of the genes indicating
that bicalutamide is acting as a weak AR-agonist in the context of
low ART-27 expression.
To determine if the observed transcriptional changes are linked
to changes in cell proliferation rates, thymidine-incorporation
assays were performed in vehicle- or bicalutamide-treated control
and ART-27–depleted LNCaP cells (Fig. 5B). Bicalutamide suppressed the proliferation rate of control cells, indicative of their
androgen-dependent status. However, the proliferation rate of ART27–depleted cells was unaffected by bicalutamide, suggesting that
ART-27–depleted cells are insensitive to bicalutamide treatment
and that loss of ART-27 may facilitate antiandrogen resistance.

Loss of ART-27 is prevalent in recurrent prostate cancer.
The above experiments suggest that loss of ART-27 may play a role
in the development of antiandrogen-resistant prostate cancer. To
investigate the possible clinical relevance of these findings, we
examined ART-27 protein expression in a tissue array, which
enabled correlation with disease outcome. Samples were from
radical prostatectomy of men not treated with antihormonal
therapy at the time of tissue acquisition. Each sample was
represented in triplicate. Because the AR antibody stains robustly,
only those samples that stained positively for AR were scored, to
ensure tissue integrity of each sample. A total of 58 AR-positive
prostate cancer cases were identified, which includes 24 that later
exhibited biochemical recurrence (as defined by 3 consecutive
increases in PSA levels), 25 that did not reoccur after radical
prostatectomy, and 9 high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia
cases. Samples from all these cases showed an intensely nuclear AR
staining pattern.
Recurrent cancers retain ART-27 cytoplasmic and perinuclear
staining but tend to lose nuclear ART-27 staining relative to high
grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia or nonrecurrent cancers
(Fig. 6A–B). Only 33% (8 of 24) of recurrent cancers exhibited nuclear
staining for ART-27, whereas 56% (14 of 25) of nonrecurring and 67%
(6 of 9) of high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia stained
positively (Fig. 6B). The remaining samples did not stain positively
for nuclear expression of ART-27. Furthermore, among the recurrent
cases, there was a significant difference between the PSA-doubling

times (indicative of disease aggressiveness) of cases that exhibited
loss of nuclear ART-27 versus those that did not. The continued
presence of ART-27 in the nucleus correlated with lengthy PSAdoubling times, suggesting slow disease progression in recurrent
cancers. Loss of nuclear ART-27 in recurrent cancers correlated with
shorter PSA-doubling times indicative of faster disease progression
(Fig. 6C). Perhaps this is not surprising given that loss of ART-27
enhances transcription of AR-regulated genes as shown above.
Altogether, the loss of ART-27 may expedite cell proliferation and
resistance to antiandrogen treatment of prostate cancer cells.

Discussion
Overall, the results in this study indicate that decreasing ART-27
protein expression enhances transcription of many androgenresponsive genes (Figs. 1–3). Thus, ART-27 functions primarily as
an AR corepressor and in its normal capacity acts to repress
transcription of androgen-regulated genes. Unlike conventional
corepressors, such as Nuclear Receptor Corepressor (N-CoR), where
the mechanism of repression via interaction with histone deacetylase is detailed, the mechanism of ART-27–mediated gene repression
is unknown. However, ART-27 likely recruits other proteins to
transcription complexes and is clearly part of a higher molecular
weight complex that includes both Rpb5, a subunit shared by RNA
polymerase (Pol) I, II, and III, and the corepressor, Unconventional
prefoldin Rpb5-Interactor (URI/C19orf2; refs. 12, 14).

ART-27 Inhibits AR Target Genes

Prostate cancer cells can evade antiandrogen therapy by
restoring AR expression and/or activity through several mechanisms including changes in AR coregulator function (1). The
mechanism leading to reduction of nuclear ART-27 expression in
prostate cancer is unknown; however, findings presented in this
report indicate that cells with diminished ART-27 expression show
elevated AR activity (Figs. 2–3) and resistance to the antiandrogen,
bicalutamide (Fig. 5). Furthermore, loss of nuclear ART-27
correlates with prostate cancer disease recurrence (Fig. 6). In fact,
the loss of ART-27 in recurring cancers presented in this report may
represent an underestimate, in the sense that even cancer
specimens scored as positive have areas that have lost nuclear
ART-27 perhaps indicating foci of more and less aggressive disease
within the same specimen. In addition, gene mutations may also
play a role in ART-27 function; for example, we have identified
somatic AR mutations that exhibit altered ART-27 interaction (32).
Results presented in Fig. 5 show that gene repression in response
to the antiandrogen, bicalutamide, is relieved when ART-27 levels
are diminished. This suggests that ART-27 plays an important role
in bicalutamide-dependent repression of AR target genes, perhaps
by affecting the recruitment of corepressors such as N-CoR and
SMRT to the AR transcription complex. Alternatively, ART-27 or its
binding partner, URI may interact with components of the
chromatin modifying/remodeling machinery. The fact that URI

Overall, the results presented here suggest that prostate cancer
cells can restore AR activity and evade antiandrogen therapy by
reducing nuclear ART-27 expression, a hypothesis we are currently
testing.
