ABSTRACT
Dysregulation of the cell cycle and cyclin-dependent kinases (cdks) is a hallmark of
cancer cells. Intervention with cdk function is currently evaluated as a therapeutic option
in many cancer types including neuroblastoma (NB), a common solid tumor of childhood.
Re-analyses of mRNA profiling data from primary NB revealed that high level mRNA
expression of both cdk1 and its corresponding cyclin, CCNB1, were significantly associated
with worse patient outcome independent of MYCN amplification, a strong indicator of
adverse NB prognosis. Cdk1 as well as CCNB1 expression were readily detectable in all
embryonal tumor cell lines investigated. Pharmacological inhibition or siRNA-mediated
knockdown of cdk1/CCNB1 induced proliferation arrest independent of MYCN status in NB
cells. Sensitivity to cdk1 inhibition was modulated by TP53, which was demonstrated using
isogenic cells with wild-type TP53 expressing either dominant-negative p53 or a short
hairpin RNA directed against TP53. Apoptosis induced by cdk1 inhibition was dependent
on caspase activation and was concomitant with upregulation of transcriptional targets
of TP53. Our results confirm an essential role for the cdk1/CCNB1 complex in tumor cell
survival. As relapsing embryonal tumors often present with p53 pathway alterations,
these findings have potential implications for therapy approaches targeting cdks.

with marked heterogeneity of clinical courses ranging
from very aggressive behavior and poor patient outcome to
spontaneous regression even without treatment [3]. Intensity
of NB therapy depends on clinical characteristics such as age
at diagnosis and metastatic spread of the disease, but also
on molecular factors, most prominently the amplification
status of the MYCN oncogene (reviewed in [4]). MYCN
amplification/ mutation is the most frequent genetic aberration
in NB affecting a single gene, which has been confirmed by

INTRODUCTION
Targeting the machinery that regulates the aberrant cell
cycle associated with malignant tumor growth is currently
regarded as a promising anti-cancer strategy. Genetic alt­
erations in cell cycle control genes have frequently been
identified in childhood tumors first, with Rb1 as one of
the most prominent examples [1,  2]. Among embryonal
tumors, neuroblastoma (NB) is a prototypic malignancy

genome-wide mutational analyses [5]. Enhanced MYCN
gene dosage is associated with early disease relapse and
unfavorable prognosis. Several lines of evidence have also
pointed to an intricate link of MYCN with proteins of the
cell cycle machinery, resulting in synthetic lethality of CDK
inhibition in MYC(N)-dependent cancers [6, 7]. It thus was
hypothesized that interfering with MYCN functions will offer
a route to tackle the most aggressive forms on NB and other
MYCN-dependent cancers. As MYCN is a transcription
factor with a wide range of target proteins and functions,
it has been enigmatic for decades, which strategy would
be optimal to interfere with MYC(N) functions. Recently,
inhibition of Brd proteins, most notably Brd4, has been
shown to be effectively down-regulating MYCN functions
at least in preclinical models of embryonal tumors including
medulloblastoma and neuroblastoma [8, 9]. Still, the clinical
usefulness of these strategies has yet to be proven.
Here, we re-analyzed mRNA array profiling
data obtained for > 100 primary NB to search for cellcycle regulated genes correlating with patient outcome
and MYCN status. Among these candidate genes, we
identified the cell cycle regulators Cyclin B1 (CCNB1)
and the cell cycle dependent kinase 1 (cdk1) as intricately
linked to patient’s prognosis. It is well known that cdk1
is overexpressed in a variety of tumor entities including
prostate cancer and oral squamous cell carcinoma [10,
11]. Mechanistically, high levels of cdk1 promote tumor
growth by stabilizing HIF1α [12] and contribute to
neoplastic transformation by phosphorylation of YAP [13].
Selective inhibition of cdk1 function by small molecules
such as RO-3306 is feasible [14] and cdk1 inhibition had
synergistic effects in combination with PARP inhibition
in preclinical models of breast cancer [15]. In the study
presented here, we investigated the effects of CCNB1/cdk1
knock down by siRNA and analyzed the consequences
of RO-3306 mediated cdk1 inhibition as a function of
variable expression of MYCN and p53 in preclinical
models of embryonal tumors including neuroblastoma,
medulloblastoma and rhabdomyosarcoma.

data were analyzed using the web-based frontend R2
(r2.amc.nl).

Cell lines
Human neuroblastoma cell lines with high MYCN
levels (IMR32, NGP, NLF, WAC2) or low MYCN
levels (NB69, SHEP, SK-N-FI) were used. RH-41
was established from a xenografted lung metastasis of
alveolar rhabodomyosarcoma [18]. WAC2 is a subclone
of SHEP cells engineered for stable overexpression
of MYCN  [19]. Inducible MYCN activation was
achieved using SHEP MYCN-ER cells. Briefly, nuclear
translocation and activation of MYCN in SHEP MYCNER cells expressing a fusion protein of MYCN and the
estrogen-responsive domain of the estrogen receptor
was induced by addition of 200 nM 4-OHT for indicated
time points as described [20]. Down-regulation of
p53 in wt-TP53 NB cell lines IMR32 and NGP was
facilitated by an shRNA directed against human p53,
while a shRNA directed against murine p53 served
as negative control [21]. HD-MB3 medulloblastoma
cells expressing a dominant-negative variant of p53
(HD-MB3 p53-dn) cells were generated by transfecting
HD-MB3 with pMSCV-puro-p53DD, and selected for
stable transfectants with 2 μg puromycin/ ml medium
[8]. MYCN was down-regulated in a MYCN-amplified
cell line, IMR5, by using a tet-inducible two vector
system [22]. In these cells, designated IMR5-shMYCN,
addition of tetracycline (1 μg/ml) to the culture media
induced ectopic overexpression of an shRNA directed
against NMYC [22]. All cell lines were cultivated
in RPMI 1640 containing 10% FCS and antibiotics
as previously described [23]. Identity of tumor cell
lines was confirmed by STR genotyping. The human
fibroblast cell line NHDF served as non-tumorigenic
control.

Gene knockdown using small interfering RNAs
(siRNAs)

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Cells were transfected with 50 nM siRNA
directed against either CCNB1 or cdk1 (Qiagen,
Hilden, Germany) using HiPerFect transfection reagent
(Qiagen). As a control, the cells were transfected with
a non-targeting siRNA (D-001210-01-05, Thermo
Scientific Dharmacon, Waltham, MA). Down-regulation
of target mRNA was validated by semi-quantitative realtime PCR.

Expression profiling of primary human NB
Affymetrix HuEx1.0 exon array data (GEO acc.
No GSE32664) were re-analyzed for the purpose this
study. The 101 NB samples used were from tumor banks
in Essen and Ghent [16]. Treatment protocols and patient
selection have been previously described [17]. In brief,
we ensured a representative distribution of tumor stages
(stage 1: n = 23; stage 2: n = 7; stage 3: n = 11; stage 4:
n = 42; stage 4s: n = 18), with 75% of the patients
(n = 76) older than one year at the time of diagnosis.
The mean age at diagnosis was 607 days and MYCN
amplification occurred in 19 patients. Microarray

implemented in GradhPad Prism® 5.0 (GraphPad Software,
San Diego, CA), which was also used for graphical
representation and calculation of standard deviation.

Cell viability assays

RESULTS

Cells were seeded in triplicates into 96 well plates to
adhere. After 24 hours the cells were treated with either a
cdk inhibitor, RO-3306, or siRNA for 48 h. Cell viability
was determined by a MTT (3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazoliumbromide) assay.

Cdk1 and CCNB1 mRNA expression are
correlated with poor outcome independent of
MYCN amplification in neuroblastoma
Data obtained from mRNA profiling of 101 primary
neuroblastoma were re-analyzed for correlation of cell
cycle genes with outcome and the MYCN amplification
status. High expression of cdk1 or CCNB1 was linked
to significantly worse outcome in the entire cohort
(Figure  1A), and this was independent of the MYCN
status (Figure 1B). Nevertheless, both cdk1 expression and
CCNB1 expression were significantly higher in MYCNamplified tumor (Figure  1C). Additionally, survival
probabilities were significantly lower in tumor with high
expression of cdk2 (p = 0.006), cdk4 (p = 0.003) or cdk6
(p = 0.045, Supplementary Figure S1A). Of these genes,
only cdk4 was significantly associated with MYCN
amplification status (p = 0.0002, Supplementary Figure
S1B). As previously reported, upregulation of cdks is
common in aggressive neuroblastoma [7, 26], but only
CCNB1/cdk1 were predictive of outcome both in the
entire cohort as well as in the MYCN normal group when
the Cyclin/ cdk pairs were considered.

Western blot
Cells were washed with cold PBS and lysed in
RIPA buffer containing proteases and phosphatase
inhibitors (Roche, Penzberg, Germany). Gel
electrophoresis, transfer to nitrocellulose membranes,
blotting and visualization was performed as described
[25]. The membranes were probed with the following
antibodies and dilutions: p53 (1:500; Santa Cruz), p21
(1:1000; Cell Signaling), CCNB1 (1:500; Abnova), cdk-1
(1:500; Milipore), NMYC (1:500: Cell Signaling), pRbSer807/811 (1:2000; Cell Signaling), PP1α and pPP1αThr320 (1:500; Cell Signaling).

Real-time PCR and semiquantitative PCR
RNA was isolated from cells using the High Pure
RNA isolation Kit (Roche). The cDNA was synthesized
with the Transcription First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit
(Roche). For semiquantitative PCRs 100 ng cDNA was
used and GAPDH was co-amplified as a control. Real-time
PCRs was performed using predesigned primers (Qiagen)
and monitored using SYBR green fluorescence on a
StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR system (Life Technologies).
Target gene expression was calculated using the delta Ct
method using GAPDH as internal control.

Cdk1 and CCNB1 are highly expressed in
neuroblastoma cell lines
Expression of both cell cycle regulators, cdk1
and CCNB1, were analyzed on mRNA and protein
level in a panel of NB cell lines presenting either with
low MYCN levels (NB69, SK-N-FI, SHEP) or with
MYCN amplification/overexpression (IMR-32, NGP,
NLF, WAC2). Both mRNA and protein levels of cdk1
and CCNB1 were elevated in all NB cell lines and the
human rhabdomyosarcoma cell line, RH-41, when
compared to a human fibroblast cell line (NHDF,
Figure 2). No significant correlation between the MYCN
status and Cdk1/CCNB1 expression could be detected
(Supplementary Figure S2). Of note, in SHEP cells
engineered to activate MYCN upon addition of 4-OHT
(SHEP MYCN-ER), CCNB1 mRNA (Figure 2A) but not
protein levels (Figure 2B) were elevated compared to
controls. Induction of shRNA-mediated down-regulation
of MYCN in a MYCN-amplified cell line, IMR5,
resulted in concomitant down-regulation of both Cdk1
and CCNB1 (Supplementary Figure S3). Thus, MYCN is
a sufficient but not necessary regulator of CCNB1/cdk1
expression, and upregulaton of CCNB1 and cdk1 is a
common feature of neuroblastoma cell lines irrespective
of their MYCN status.

Apoptosis and caspase assays
Apoptosis was monitored following cdk inhibition
for 48 h using the Cell Death Kit Plus (Roche) allowing for
the specific determination of mono- and oligonucleosomes
as consequence of DNA fragmentation. Caspase activity
was determined using luminogenic Caspase 8 or Caspase
9 substrates (Caspase Glo Assay, Promega), respectively,
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. For rescue
experiments, cells were seeded on 12 well plates for 24 h
and then treated with either RO-3306 in the presence
or absence of the pan-caspase inhibitor, Q-VD-OPh
(Calbiochem), for 48 h.

Statistical analyses
Statistical significance of differences between
treatment groups was determined using a Student t-test

Figure 1: CCNB1 and cdk1 mRNA expression correlate with a poor outcome and MYCN expression in neuroblastoma.

A, B. Kaplan Meyer analyses of 101 primary NB revealed a significant correlation between overall survival and both cdk1 and CCNB1 mRNA
expression. The cohort was split into two groups with either “high” or “low” cdk1 / CCNB1 expression and the numbers depict the respective
group size, when the entire cohort (A) or the subset with normal MYCN status (B) were analyzed. P-values were adjusted for multiple testing
of different group sizes using a Bonferroni correction implemented in the R2 visualisation module (accessible at http://r2.amc.nl). C. Tumors
harboring a MYCN amplification have significantly higher cdk1/CCNB1 expression compared to MYCN non-amplified tumors.

Knock-down of CCNB1 or cdk1 by specific
siRNAs causes a decrease in NB cell proliferation

by decreased cell viability in a concentration dependent
manner (Figure 4A, Table 1). Interestingly, both the
rhabdomyosarcoma cells as well as the non-tumorigenic
NHDF cells were more resistant to RO-3306 than the NB
cells in our panel. IC50-values in NB cells ranged between
1.3 μM and 4 μM, while RH-41 cells had an IC50-value >
8 μM. In isogenic NB cells with low (SHEP) or high levels
of MYCN (WAC2) response to RO-3306 was comparable
(IC5048 h:1.3 μM and 1.8 μM, respectively).

Transient downregulation of CCNB1 or cdk1 was
achieved by sequence-specific siRNAs in a panel of five
neuroblastoma cell lines. Both mRNA and protein levels
of CCNB1 and cdk1 were significantly and specifically
decreased 48 h after transfection (Figure 3A–3C). Cell
viability after knock-down of CCNB1 was significantly
reduced in SHEP and WAC2 cells, while reduction of cell
viability upon knock-down of cdk1 (Figure 3D) was only
significant in NB69 cells. A trend for reduced viability was
present in all other cell lines, with the exception of the
p53-mutated cell line, SK-N-FI, in which cdk1 or CCNB1
downregulation had no effect (Figure 3D).

Sensitivity to cell cycle inhibition is modulated
by p53 status but not by MYCN levels
Interestingly, all cell lines harboring a p53
mutation, SK-N-FI, NLF and RH-41, displayed decreased
sensitivity towards treatment with RO-3306 compared to
p53 wt cells (data are summarized in Table 1). Neither
down-regulation of MYCN in IMR5-TR-shNMYC
cells (Supplementary Figure S3) nor induction of
MYCN activity in SHEP MYCN-ER cells significantly
altered cell viability (Supplementary Figure S4). Thus,
the MYCN status did not affect sensitivity to RO3306. The same p53-dependent effect was observed,
when a pan cdk-inhibitor (JNJ-7706621) was used
(Table 1 and Supplementary Figure S3–S5). Again,
sensitivity to JNJ-7706621 did not depend on MYCN
(Supplementary Figure S3C). Furthermore, when all cell
lines were grouped according to their p53 status, cell

The cdk1 inhibitor, RO-3306, causes a
significant reduction of cell viability in
neuroblastoma cell lines
To further characterize the impact of the cdk1/
CCNB1 axis on NB cell survival, we used a previously
described cdk1 inhibitor, RO-3306 [14]. The effect of RO3306 on cell viability was analyzed in the same cell line
panel as described above. Additionally, a human fibroblast
cell line (NHDF) as well as a rhabdomyosarcoma cell line,
RH-41, were included for evaluation of tumor cell specific
effects. All cell lines responded to RO-3306 treatment

Figure 2: Cdk1 and CCNB1 are highly expressed in neuroblastoma cell lines. A. CCNB1 and cdk1 mRNA-levels were

analyzed by semi-quantitative PCR in seven neuroblastoma cell lines (IMR32, NGP, NLF, WAC2, SHEP, NB69, SK-N-FI) and in the
rhabdomyosarcoma cell line RH-41. Expression was normalized to IMR32 cells and compared to the human fibroblast cell line (NHDF).
Cell lines were grouped according to their MYCN expression status (yellow= MYCN high, green= MYCN low). In SHEP-MYCN cells,
MYCN can be targeted to the nucleus and thus activated by addition of 4-OHT (marked in red). B. Western Blot analyses revealed higher
protein levels of cdk1 and CCNB1 in the tumor cell lines compared to NHDF cells. MYCN activation by 4-OHT in SHEP-MYCN cells did
not result in elevated CCNB1 or cdk1 expression, although CCNB1 mRNA expression was higher compared to controls.

siRNA against cdk1 (siCDK1) and CCNB1 (siCCNB1a, siCCNB1b) specifically downregulated the protein evels of the respective targets
as revealed by Western Blot analyses. In (B) and (C), semi-quantitative real-time PCR for CDK1 and CCNB1 confirmed that downregulation of the respective mRNAs was also specific when compared to the controls. Values are presented as normalised to untreated control

Figure 4: Inhibition of cdk1 by a small molecule inhibitor, RO-3306, induces apoptosis and causes an activation of the
p53 signaling pathway. A. Inhibition of cdk1 by RO-3306 caused decreased cell viability after 48 h in all NB cell lines investigated and

also in the rhabdomyosarcoma cell line RH-41 in a concentration dependent manner. The human fibroblast cell line, NHDF, and the cell
lines harboring p53 mutation (SK-N-FI, RH-41) were more resistant to RO-3306 than the tumor cell lines with p53 wild type. B. Cell cycle
distribution was analyzed 24 h and 48 h after RO-3306 treatment. Only cells harboring a p53 mutation (SK-N-FI, NLF) presented with
significantly higher fraction of G2 phase (left side), while all cell lines had significantly elevated subG1 indicative of apoptosis. C. Significant
induction of apoptosis by RO-3306 could be confirmed in all cell lines by a colorimetric assay detecting nucleosomes. D. Activation of the

lines without functional p53 displayed 1.7-fold higher
resistance to RO-3306 and 1.8-fold higher resistance to
JNJ-7706621 (Supplementary Table 1). Specificity of
cdk1 inhibition by RO-3306 in NB cells was analyzed
by interrogating the phosphorylation status of the cdk1
target protein phosphatase 1α (PP1α -Thr320) as well as
phosphorylation of pRb at Ser 807/811, which is mainly
governed by cdk4. In all cell lines except for p53-mutated
SK-N-FI cells, a reduction of phosphorylated PP1α was
observed after four hours following treatment with RO3306, while RO-3306 did not affect pRb-phosphorylation
(Supplementary Figure S6). Thus, NB cell viability
can be significantly reduced by cdk-1 inhibition, while
sensitivity to RO-3306 and JNJ-7706621 correlated with
p53-mutational status rather than with MYCN levels.

previously described isogenic IMR32 and NGP cells, in
which p53 knock-down is mediated by shRNA [21]. These
cells were designated IMR32-LV-h-p53 and NGP-LVh-p53, respectively, and the results compared to parental
cells or negative controls, which were stably transfected
with shRNA against murine p53. Both cell lines also differ
in the MDM2 status, as NGP cells harbor an amplification
of MDM2, a negative regulator of p53. First, we excluded
that knock-down of murine or human p53 had an effect on
cdk1 or CCNB1 expression (Supplementary Figure S7).
Interestingly, both p53 knock-down cell lines were more
resistant to RO-3306 treatment when compared to the
control cell lines and the parental cells. The fraction of
viable IMR32-LV-h-p53 cells was also significantly higher
at the highest concentration of RO-3306 tested (8 μM,
Figure 5A), while NGP-LV-h-p53 were significantly more
resistant than control cells at lower doses (Supplementary
Figure S8A). To further delineate if p53 function was
involved in RO-3306 mediated reduction of cell viability,
we analyzed HD-MB3 medulloblastoma cells with or
without expression of a dominant-negative form of p53

of cells in G2-phase. Similar results were also obtained
in the model systems with reduced p53 levels (IMR32LV-h-p53) and in cells expressing a dominant negative
variant of p53 (HDMB3 p53-dn, Figure 5). Next, we
assessed, if the observed G2 arrest induced by RO-3306
was dose-dependent. Treatment of parental IMR32 and
HDMB3 cells with higher concentrations of RO-3306 did
not increase the number of G2-phase cells after 48 hours
(Figure 5B), while both the parental, MDM2-amplified,
NGP cells as well as NGP-LV-h-p53 cells presented
with a G2-phase arrest 24 h and 48 h (Supplementary
Figure S8B). Thus, cell cycle analyses revealed that
p53-deficiency modulates response to cdk1 inhibition by
increasing the fraction of cells in G2, but that decreased
p53-function does not impair RO-3306-induced apoptosis.

RO-3306 induces cell death and a p53 status
dependent increase in G2 phase cells
As cdk1 is a cell cycle regulator promoting the
transition from G2- to M-phase, we next investigated
the effects of cdk1 inhibition on cell cycle distribution
and apoptosis. Cell cycle analyses revealed an increase
of the subG1-phase in our NB cell line panel 24 h and
48 h after RO-3306 treatment. This effect was significant
in all cell lines independent of p53 mutational status
(Figure 4B). Enhanced apoptosis could also be confirmed
by an assay detecting isolated nucleosomes (Figure 4C).
In p53-wt cells, activation of the p53-pathway by RO3306 resulted in enhanced p21 expression after 24 hours,
while p53-mutated cells failed to activate p21 (Figure 4D,
Supplementary Figure S9). Additionally, the p53
downstream targets BAX and MDM2 were upregulated
after cdk1 inhibition in p53 wt cells (Supplementary
Figure S9). Instead, p53 mutated cell lines (SK-N-FI

and caspase 9 activity, respectively. Activation of both
caspase 8 and caspase 9 upon treatment with RO-3306

dominant negative p53 variant (HDMB-3 p53-dn) are more resistant to RO-3306 treatment than the parental HDMB-3 cells (upper part).
Additionally, IMR32-NB cells harboring a shRNA against human p53 (IMR32-LV-h-p53) were less sensitive to RO-3306 compared to
control cells transfected with shRNA directed against murine p53 (IMR32-LV-h-p53) and parental IMR-32 cells. B. Cell cycle analyses
performed for the same cell panel as in (A) revealed a significant increase in G2 phase 48 hours after RO-3306 treatment only in the
absence of functional p53. When control cells were treated at higher doses corresponding to the IC50 values of cells without functional p53
(indicated by an orange line), IMR-32 cells had also a significantly increased G2 fraction 48 hours after treatment with RO-3306. Again, in
all cell lines RO-3306 caused an increase in the sub G1 fraction. Significant differences between untreated cells and inhibitor treated cells
are depicted using the following code “***”: p < 0.001; “**”: p = 0.001–0.01; “*”: p = 0.01–0.05.

Figure 6: RO-3306 induced apoptosis is mediated by caspases. A. Caspase-8 and -9 activities were investigated by colorimetric
assays (“Caspase Glo”, Promega). RO-3306 caused elevated caspase-8 and -9 activities in all cell lines investigated after 48 hours and
this increase was significant as indicated. B. RO-3306-induced apoptosis could be abrogated by co-treatment with a pan-caspase inhibitor,
(Q-VD-OPh, used at a final concentration of 12.5 μM). This rescue effect was observed using a colorimetric assay (Cell Death ELISA,
Roche) and confirmed by FACS-based cell cycle analyses (Supplementary Figure S10). Significances between RO-3306-treated cells and
untreated cells (A) or between RO-3306 treated cells in the presence of absence of pan-caspase inhibitor are depicted using the following

reduction of the apoptotic response in all cell lines

increase of cells in G2-phase in addition to suppression of

caspase-mediated apoptosis seems to be responsible for
the observed cell death upon RO-3306 treatment.

DISCUSSION

or the quinolinyl thiazolinone derivative, RO-3306 ( [14],
Figure 4), to inhibit CCNB1/cdk1, we observed decreased
cell viability and an increased number of apoptotic cells
in all NB cell lines investigated. Interestingly, inhibitor
efficiency depended on the p53 status, as cells with p53
mutation were more resistant to treatment with RO3306. The impact of the p53 status on inhibitor efficiency
could be confirmed in p53 knock down cells (Figure 5A).
Additionally, higher inhibitor concentrations were
required to decrease viability in a cell line (NGP) with
functional inactivation of p53 due to MDM2 amplification.
Increased resistance to cdk inhibition in the absence of
functional p53 was not confined to neuroblastoma cells
as shown in HDMB3 medulloblastoma cells expressing a
dominant negative variant of p53 (Figure 5A). In all cell
lines analyzed, p53 status did not affect CCNB1 or cdk1
expression mRNA level or protein levels. Thus, sensitivity
to CCNB1 or cdk1 inhibition was modulated by functional
p53, but was not dependent on the MYCN status.
The most prominent function of CCNB1 and cdk1
is to form a complex activating the serine/threonine kinase
function of cdk1 thus regulating the transition from G2phase to M-phase. As cdk1 is also sufficient to drive the
entire cell cycle [35], we checked for specific changes
in cell cycle distribution upon cdk1 inhibition. In cells
with intact p53 signaling, apoptosis was the predominant
response to cdk1 inhibition (Figure 4C). Our results add
further evidence to the hypothesis that p53 status rather than
MYCN expression governs the sensitivity to cdk inhibition
(Supplementary Figure S3–5) and, moreover, indicate that
the cdk1/CCNB1 axis is important for the resistance to cdk
inhibition by loss of functional p53 in neuroblastoma cells
(Supplementary Table 1). Accumulation of p53 protein after
cdk1 inhibition coincided with transcriptional upregulation
of p53 targets, p21, BAX and MDM2 (Supplementary
Figure S9). These results confirm earlier reports obtained
upon RO-3306 treatment of AML cells [36]. It is also
known that p53 can be phosphorylated by cdk1 at Ser315
and that this phosphorylation destabilizes p53 (ref. [34]).
Therefore, earlier reports that cdk1 inhibition might
function independently of the cellular p53 status, could
possibly be attributed to unspecific inhibitors used [37]. In
cells without functional p53 a significant increase in G2
phase was the major response to RO-3306 (Figure 4B,
5B), and this could be confirmed in cells expressing either
a shRNA targeting p53 or a dominant negative form of p53.
Mechanistically, this difference in the apoptotic response
could not be attributed to differential activation of effector
caspases, as caspase 8 and 9 were activated after 48 h.
Caspase-9 phosphorylation by cdk1 has been described
to protect cells from apoptosis during mitosis [38], while
caspase-8 cleavage and thus activation is regulated by
concerted action of cdk1 and polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1, ref.
[39]). Consequently, a pan-caspase inhibitor could block
activation of both caspase-8 and caspase-9 activation
observed upon RO-3306 treatment and could significantly

Uncontrolled proliferation plays a major role in
cancer development and progression [28]. Under normal
physiological conditions, cell cycle control is executed by
a delicate interplay of cyclin dependent kinases (cdks) and
their corresponding cyclins, whereas overexpression or
amplification of cyclins and cdks is observed in various
cancer types. Therefore, several cdk inhibitors were
developed and entered early clinical phases, but those
investigational drugs, including the pan cdk inhibitors
flavopiridol and roscovitine, showed moderate effects and
dose-limiting toxicities. Finding a therapeutic window was
reported as a major difficulty [29]. In recent years, more
specific inhibitors became available, which might have
preferable anti-tumor characteristics compared to the broad
spectrum inhibitors used before. Of note, a combined cdk4/
cdk6 inhibitor, palbociclib, recently received “breakthrough
therapy” status for the treatment of ER+/HER2- breast
cancer. However, identification of the best suited inhibitor
will depend on the tumor type and still is a challenge.
In neuroblastoma (NB), genomic amplifications of
CCND1 [30] and cdk4 [31] were observed in primary
tumors, albeit at low frequency. Nevertheless, cdk4 and
CCND1 levels are found to be generally expressed at
higher levels in NB than in other tumors [30]. Inhibition
of cdk4 and cdk6 has also been shown promising activity
in preclinical NB models [32]. Moreover, inactivation
of cdk2 is synthetic lethal in MYCN-amplified tumor
cells and cdk2 was also proposed as a potential target for
NB therapy [7, 33]. Here, we confirm high expression
of cdks as a feature of NB with unfavorable prognosis
and additionally identify CCNB1/cdk1 expression as an
MYCN-independent risk factor (Supplementary Figure
S1). Both CCNB1 and cdk1 mRNAs are highly expressed
in primary NB and this was correlated with reduced overall
survival (Figure 1). NB cell lines derived from high-stage,
aggressive tumors as well as the rhabdomyosarcoma
cell line RH-41 all presented with high cdk1/CCNB1
expression independent of the MYCN amplification status
(Figure 2). Induction of MYCN in a MYCN-normal cell
line caused upregulation of cdk1/CCNB1 expression,
while decreased MYCN expression in a MYCN-amplified
cell line resulted in reduced cdk1/CCNB1 expression
(Supplementary Figure S3B). However, the high
expression levels of cdk1/CCNB1 in cell lines with normal
MYCN (Figure 2), which are also found in primary tumors
in the absence of MYCN amplification, left us to conclude
that MYCN is a sufficient but not a necessary driver of
cdk1/CCNB1 in neuroblastoma cells.
A prominent downstream target of the CCNB1/
cdk1 complex is the tumor suppressor p53, which restricts
uncontrolled cell growth by inducing cell cycle arrest,
mainly in G1, or apoptosis. Inhibition of CCNB1/cdk1
reactivated and stabilized p53 in cells with functional loss
of p53 [34]. Using sequence-specific siRNAs (Figure 3)

rescue cells from RO-3306-induced apoptosis independent
of the p53 status (Figure 6). Thus, by a combination of lossof-function and rescue experiments we could confirm p53
as well as caspase-8 and caspase-9 as important modulators
of the response to cdk1-inhibition by RO-3306.
In summary, we here demonstrate that cdk1
inhibition by RO-3306 causes apoptosis in a panel of
preclinical embryonal tumor models with wild-type
53 and that inhibitor efficiency was determined by p53
mutational status. Induction of apoptosis by cdk1inhibition depended on functional p53 signaling, while
in cells with p53 inactivation or in cells harboring TP53
mutations a significant G2 phase arrest was observed.
Further investigation of these effects in in vivo models is
warranted to evaluate the efficacy of targeting cdk1 as a
novel tool in tumor therapy.
