Summary
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Interactions between commensals and the host impact the metabolic and immune status of
metazoans. Their deregulation is associated with age-related pathologies like chronic
inflammation and cancer, especially in barrier epithelia. Maintaining a healthy commensal
population by preserving innate immune homeostasis in such epithelia thus promises to promote
health and longevity. Here we show that in the aging intestine of Drosophila, chronic activation of
the transcription factor Foxo reduces expression of Peptidoglycan Recognition Protein SC2
(PGRP-SC2), a negative regulator of IMD/Relish innate immune signaling, and homologue of the
anti-inflammatory molecules PGLYRP1-4. This repression causes deregulation of Rel/NFkB
activity, resulting in commensal dysbiosis, stem cell hyperproliferation, and epithelial dysplasia.
Restoring PGRP-SC2 expression in enterocytes of the intestinal epithelium, in turn, prevents
dysbiosis, promotes tissue homeostasis and extends lifespan. Our results highlight the importance
of commensal control for lifespan of metazoans, and identify SC-class PGRPs as longevitypromoting factors.

Introduction
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Loss of proliferative homeostasis and regenerative capacity in high-turnover tissues is a
hallmark of aging, yet the causes of this decline are only beginning to be understood.
Chronic inflammation is associated with this loss of homeostasis and with increased cancer
incidence in aging organisms (Grivennikov et al., 2010). This is particularly significant in
barrier epithelia like the intestinal epithelium, which mount frequent and required immune
responses to pathogenic microorganisms, but also engage in mutually beneficial interactions
with commensals that shape the host immune system and provide essential metabolic
functions (Clemente et al., 2012; Hooper et al., 2012; Nicholson et al., 2012; Shin et al.,
2011; Storelli et al., 2011). Changes in commensal populations (‘dysbiosis’) are associated
with disorders like inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), autoimmune and allergic diseases,

The effects of aging on the microbiota, and the consequences of microbiome changes on
tissue homeostasis in the aging intestine remain unclear. Recent studies that have
characterized gut microbiota composition in the elderly have found that the microbiota of
older people is different and more diverse than that of younger adults (Claesson et al., 2011),
and that microbiota composition in the elderly correlates significantly with measures of
frailty and co-morbidity (Claesson et al., 2012). It has been proposed that the inflammation
associated with dysbiosis promotes the development of various age-related diseases of the
host, and that manipulating host/commensal interactions might be a viable avenue to
promote healthy aging (Biagi et al., 2013; Ottaviani et al., 2011). Better mechanistic insight
into the interactions between the microflora, innate immune responses, as well as
regenerative processes in the intestinal epithelium is thus key (Clemente et al., 2012).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The Drosophila intestine is a productive model to characterize age-related changes in hostcommensal interactions, innate immune signaling and regenerative capacity (Buchon et al.,
2013; Chambers and Schneider, 2012). The intestinal epithelium is constantly being
renewed in a process that mechanistically and morphologically resembles cell turnover in
the intestinal epithelium of mammals (Buchon et al., 2013; Biteau et al., 2011a; Micchelli
and Perrimon, 2006; Ohlstein and Spradling, 2006). Intestinal Stem Cells (ISCs) are the only
dividing cells in the intestinal epithelium and can give rise to at least two differentiated
intestinal cell types: enteroendocrine cells (EEs) and enterocytes (ECs) (Micchelli and
Perrimon, 2006; Ohlstein and Spradling, 2006). This lineage is critical for normal tissue
turnover, as well as for epithelial recovery after damage or infection (Buchon et al., 2009a;
Buchon et al., 2009b; Jiang et al., 2009), but is deregulated in the aging intestine, where ISC
proliferation strongly increases, and polyploid, mis-differentiated cells accumulate in the
epithelium (Biteau et al., 2008; Biteau et al., 2010; Buchon et al., 2009a). This dysplastic
phenotype disrupts epithelial function, resulting in age-related metabolic decline in the
whole fly, as well as loss of the intestinal barrier function (Biteau et al., 2010; Rera et al.,
2011; Rera et al., 2012). Intestinal dysplasia influences Drosophila lifespan, as limiting the
rate of ISC proliferation in the aging intestine is sufficient to extend lifespan (Biteau et al.,
2010; Rera et al., 2011).
Control of ISC proliferation by microbiome and innate immune homeostasis

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

ISC proliferation rates are regulated by multiple stress and growth factor signaling
pathways, including the JNK, Jak/Stat, p38 MAPK, and EGFR pathways, whose activity is
influenced by the commensal microflora and by infection with pathogenic bacteria
(Amcheslavsky et al., 2009; Apidianakis et al., 2009; Biteau et al., 2008; Biteau and Jasper,
2011; Biteau et al., 2010; Buchon et al., 2009a; Buchon et al., 2010; Buchon et al., 2009b;
Chatterjee and Ip, 2009; Jiang et al., 2011; Jiang et al., 2009). In young flies, commensal
bacteria maintain basal activation of JNK and Jak/Stat activities in ISCs, ensuring low levels
of epithelial renewal (Buchon et al., 2009a). In older flies, however, this stimulation of JNK
and JAK/Stat signaling becomes de-regulated, inducing the intestinal dysplasia described
above. Accordingly, axenically aged flies have significantly fewer mitotic ISCs than
conventionally reared animals, but the physiologic consequences of these changes have not
yet been explored (Buchon et al., 2009a). Interestingly, the number of microorganisms
found in the lumen of the gut significantly increases with age (Ren et al., 2007), suggesting
that an age-related impairment in the ability to manage the intestinal microflora is the
underlying cause of intestinal dysplasia, and may limit lifespan. The causes of this
impairment remain unclear.

Management of the commensal flora and innate immune responses to pathogens are
achieved primarily by two strategies acting in Drosophila ECs: Expression and activation of
Dual Oxidase (Duox), which initiates an oxidative burst response, producing high levels of
reactive oxygen species (ROS) (Ha et al., 2009a; Ha et al., 2009b; Ha et al., 2005), and
activation of the immune deficiency (IMD/Relish) pathway, which activates the NFkB-like
transcription factor Relish and promotes the expression of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs)
(Buchon et al., 2009a; Leulier and Royet, 2009). Duox is regulated transcriptionally by a
p38 MAPK signaling pathway and is activated by Gαq-PLCβ-Ca2+ signaling in response to
bacterially derived Uracil (Ha et al., 2009a; Ha et al., 2009b; Lee et al., 2013). Flies lacking
Duox activity have short life spans due to uncontrollable propagation of dietary yeast and
due to an inability to control mutualistic and infectious bacteria (Ha et al., 2009a; Ha et al.,
2009b). The IMD/Relish pathway is triggered by bacteria-derived peptidoglycan through
activation of the peptidoglycan recognition protein (PGRP-LC) receptor (Hoffmann, 2003;
Kim and Kim, 2005; Sorbara and Philpott, 2011). It is required for gut immunity against
ROS-resistant pathogens and has been proposed to complement Duox-mediated immune
responses (Ryu et al., 2006; Ryu et al., 2008). However, chronic activation of IMD/Relish
signaling in the gut can sensitize flies to bacterial infection and shorten lifespan (Bonnay et
al., 2013; Maillet et al., 2008). In aging flies, AMP expression significantly increases both
systemically and in the gut, suggesting a link between chronic activation of the IMD/Relish
pathway and age-related changes in the gut (Libert et al., 2006; Ren et al., 2007).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Here, we characterize the age-related breakdown of intestinal innate immune homeostasis in
aging Drosophila. We identify an interaction between the transcription factor Foxo and the
IMD/Rel pathway, driven by Foxo-mediated repression of peptidoglycan recognition
proteins (PGRPs) of the SC class, that promotes commensal dysbiosis and epithelial
dysplasia in aging guts. Strikingly, over-expressing PGRP-SC2 in ECs prevents ageassociated dysbiosis and dysplasia, and extends lifespan in conventionally, but not in
axenically reared animals. Our findings suggest that a breakdown of host/commensal
interactions is central to age-associated tissue degeneration in barrier epithelia, and identify
strategies to promote tissue homeostasis by improving these interactions, extending lifespan.

Results
Deregulation of the commensal microflora in aging uninfected flies

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Since Drosophila lifespan is impacted by intestinal dysplasia (Biteau et al., 2010), and this
dysplasia can be prevented by maintaining flies axenically (Buchon et al., 2009a), we sought
to identify the causes for the age-related deregulation of commensal control. We first
confirmed that age-related dysplasia was associated with increased microbial loads in
various genetic backgrounds. We quantified overall microbial load by measuring colonyforming units (CFUs) in dissected guts of young and old age, using selective plates to
identify Enterobacteriaceae, Lactobacillae, Acetobacteriaceae, and other bacteria grown on
nutrient rich medium (using these selective plates, the majority of the commensal
microbiome of flies can be monitored)(Ryu et al., 2008)(Fig. 1A). Confirming previous
findings (Buchon et al., 2009a; Ren et al., 2007), the number of CFUs in the gut of
conventionally reared flies increased exponentially for all analyzed bacterial phylotypes in
the first 30 days of age (Fig. 1A and Fig. 2C). Epithelial dysplasia correlated with this
dysbiosis in all tested genetic backgrounds, and, consistent with (Buchon et al., 2009a), was
not observed in axenically reared animals (Fig. 1B, C, 2C–E, and S1). We used two different
techniques for axenic rearing: maintaining flies in sterile conditions, or in media containing
a cocktail of antibiotics (Ryu et al., 2008). In both conditions, low commensal numbers
correlated with ISC quiescence (Fig. 1C, S1C).

Transcriptome profiles comparing conventionally and axenically reared intestines

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Since dysbiosis thus causes epithelial dysplasia, the origin of dysbiosis has to be determined
to understand the etiology of age-related degeneration in the fly intestine. Towards this goal,
we compared expression profiles of intestines of axenically and conventionally aging flies.
We hypothesized that age-related changes in gene expression observed exclusively in
conventionally reared animals are likely to represent epithelial responses to the expanding
commensal population (i.e. events that occur as a consequence of, rather than cause
commensal dysbiosis). Changes in epithelial gene expression observed in both
conventionally reared and axenically reared animals, on the other hand, are expected to
inform about the underlying epithelial changes causing dysbiosis.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Using RNAseq, we obtained expression data for about 8000 genes in each sample of
conventionally or axenically reared flies at 2, 10, 20, 30, and 40 days of age (Fig. 1D).
While a large number of ‘housekeeping’ genes did not significantly change with age (see
examples in Fig. S1D), we identified and characterized groups of genes with similar ageassociated increases in expression using hierarchical clustering. Functional classification of
these genes and gene ontology enrichment analysis is expected to highlight specific
functional changes in aging intestines. The expression profiles of selected representative
genes in these groups were validated independently using qRT-PCR (Figs. 2B, D, S1E, S2,
3A, and not shown). Interestingly, the number of genes induced with age in both conditions,
or induced exclusively in conventionally reared animals, was much higher than the number
of genes found to be significantly induced only in the axenically reared animals (Fig. 1D).
This observation supports the idea that aging-induced genes common to both conditions
would reveal a transcriptional program underlying age-related epithelial changes, while
aging-induced genes specific to conventionally reared animals would reveal the epithelial
response to commensals.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

When absolute expression levels were compared, the group of genes more highly expressed
in conventionally compared to axenically reared animals across all ages was enriched in
genes classified as ‘immune response’ genes (Fig. 1E). The group of genes induced in both
axenically and conventionally aging guts, in turn, was enriched in genes belonging to GO
categories commonly associated with aseptic wounding responses (GO categories ‘response
to stress’, ‘cytoskeletal organization’ and ‘cell adhesion’, compare with (Boutros et al.,
2002)), indicating that tissue damage in the gut increases with age independently of bacteria
(Fig. 1E). This was consistent with the fact that cytokines commonly associated with
wounding responses (Upd 1 and 2, Pvf 1and 2), and markers of JAK/Stat activation
(Socs36E) were also significantly induced under both aging conditions (Fig. S1E). Upds,
which activate JAK/Stat signaling, are secreted by damaged ECs, triggering compensatory
proliferation of ISCs (Jiang et al., 2009).
A significant difference between axenically and conventionally reared guts was observed in
a group of genes involved in oxidative stress responses and in responses to JNK activation
(Jasper et al., 2001; Wang et al., 2003). These genes were induced with age in
conventionally but not axenically reared animals (Fig. 2A), a finding consistent with the
bacteria-dependent induction of Dual Oxidase (Duox) (Fig. 2B, S2A) and the increase in
ROS observed in aging intestines (Hochmuth et al., 2011). These results are further
consistent with the lack of age-related dysplasia in both axenic conditions and when ROS
concentration is reduced in the gut (Fig. 1C) (Buchon et al., 2009a; Hochmuth et al., 2011),
and support a model in which age-related dysbiosis induces expression of Duox, resulting in
ISC hyper-proliferation due to increased ROS production. Accordingly, strong correlations
between CFUs and age (R2=0.99), duox expression and CFUs (R2=0.87), and between duox
expression and mitotic figures (R2=0.73) were observed (Fig. 2C–E). These correlations
suggest a refractory period for the increased proliferative activity of ISCs, which is induced

only after a threshold for duox expression is reached. Interestingly, this threshold was
reached at an age when mortality within a wild-type population starts to increase, supporting
a causal relationship between commensal dysbiosis, loss of redox homeostasis, dysplasia,
and increased mortality (see Fig.6). The underlying cause for the age-related commensal
dysbiosis that induces this degenerative condition, however, remained unclear.
Age-related immunosenescence

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Surprisingly, the group of genes induced with age in both conditions was also enriched in
genes classified as ‘immune response’ genes (Fig. 1E). This includes AMP-encoding genes,
although their induction was generally delayed and their expression levels were reduced in
axenically, compared to conventionally aged animals (Fig. 2F,G, S2). Since AMP genes
(like Diptericin, Dpt) are regulated by the IMD/Rel pathway, these results indicated that Rel
activity is increased in the intestinal epithelium of both conventionally and axenically reared
animals. This is consistent with the fact that rel itself is transcriptionally induced in
axenically aging guts (see Fig. 3C, Fig. S2B). Interestingly, this age-related activation of
IMD/Rel signaling in axenically reared flies is associated with an acquired deficiency in
intestinal immune function, as illustrated by the fact that the ability to clear the moderately
pathogenic bacterium S. Marcescens from the gut is impaired in old flies (Fig. 2H), while
resistance to S.Marcescens or Erwinia carotovora carotovora 15 – induced mortality
decreases (Fig. S2D). These defects are consistent with previously reported activation of Rel
in aging tissues and concurrent increases in bacterial load (Brummel et al., 2004; Buchon et
al., 2009a; Libert et al., 2006; Ren et al., 2007; Ryu et al., 2008), and with the observation
that chronic activation of IMD/Rel signaling sensitizes flies to infection (Bonnay et al.,
2013; Maillet et al., 2008). Activation of IMD/Rel signaling may thus constitute a cause for
the observed dysbiosis, a hypothesis that we decided to test by exploring the regulation of
Rel activity in the aging intestinal epithelium.
EC-specific Foxo activity induces immunosenescence

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Rel activation and AMP expression are not only triggered by bacterial antigens, but are also
modulated by the insulin/IGF signaling (IIS) pathway (Becker et al. 2010; Diangelo et al.,
2009; Karpac et al., 2011; Libert et al., 2006). IIS-regulated Foxo can transcriptionally
activate AMP genes through both Rel/NFkB-dependent and independent mechanisms
(Becker et al. 2010), and in the larval fatbody, Foxo induces Rel expression under starvation
conditions (Karpac et al., 2011). Among the genes found to be induced in both axenic and
conventionally reared flies were Foxo target genes (Fig. 3A), suggesting that Foxo activity
increases in the aging intestine. Using qRT-PCR and a thor-lacZ Foxo reporter (Karpac et
al., 2011), we confirmed that Foxo activity increases in aging intestines under both axenic
conditions and in conventionally reared flies (Fig.3A, B, S3A, B). In related work, we have
found that this activation occurs exclusively in ECs, as induction of thor-lacZ can be
detected in ECs, but not ISCs or EBs (Karpac et al., 2013). This age-associated chronic
activation of Foxo in ECs disrupts their metabolic activity (Karpac et al., 2013), and our
results reported here suggest that this chronic activation also deregulates their innate
immune function. Supporting this idea, we found that loss of Foxo, either systemically (in
foxoW24 loss of function mutants, (Becker et al., 2010; Weber et al., 2005)), or specifically
in ECs (in flies expressing FoxoRNAi under the control of the pan-EC driver NP1∷Gal4, see
also (Karpac et al., 2013)) reduced the age-related increase in Rel and Dpt expression, in
both axenic and conventional conditions (Fig. 3C, D, S3C).
Foxo activity in ECs is thus required for the age-related increase in Rel expression and
activity. It remained unclear, however, if Foxo affects the innate immune response in the gut
by regulating rel or AMP expression directly, or by influencing the IMD/Rel pathway more
generally. Interestingly, our RNASeq experiment indicated that the SC class of

peptidoglycan recognition proteins (PGRP-SC 1a, 1b, and 2) was repressed in axenically
aging guts (Fig. 4A), and subsequent validation by RT-PCR in various genetic backgrounds
found that this repression could be observed reproducibly in both axenic and conventionally
aging animals (Fig. 4B, C, S4A). Foxo activity in ECs is both required (Fig. 4B, C, S4A)
and sufficient (Fig. 4D, S4B) to inhibit PGRP-SC2 and PGRP-SC1a expression in the gut
(the effects of Foxo over-expression are not caused by apoptosis, as the pro-apoptotic Foxo
target gene hid was not induced, and gut morphology was preserved; Fig. S4C and not
shown).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

PGRP-SCs are catalytic PGRPs that can scavenge peptidoglycan and act as feedback
inhibitors of the IMD/Rel innate immune signaling pathway, ensuring immune homeostasis
(Bischoff et al., 2006; Paredes et al., 2011). The vertebrate homologues of PGRP-SCs,
PGLYRP1-4, limit intestinal inflammation in rodents (Saha et al., 2010). In response to
bacterial infection, these genes are induced, limiting the innate immune response and
preventing excessive inflammation (Bischoff et al., 2006; Paredes et al., 2011). Overexpression of Foxo in ECs, however, strongly suppressed infection-induced expression of
PGRP-SC2 in the gut (using Ecc infection, Fig. 4E), resulting in elevated dpt expression that
could be dampened by treating animals with the Rel inhibitor PDTC (Moskalev and
Shaposhnikov, 2011; Tanenhaus et al., 2012)(Fig. 4F). Increased AMP expression in Foxo
gain-of-function conditions was thus Rel-dependent, and, as in old flies, was associated with
an inability to efficiently clear bacteria (Fig. 4G, H). Taken together, these findings indicate
that limiting Foxo activity in ECs is critical to ensure moderate and effective innate immune
responses in the intestinal epithelium.
Age-related deregulation of commensal microbiota by Foxo limits lifespan
To test whether the repression of PGRP-SCs by Foxo contributes to age-related dysbiosis
and dysplasia, we analyzed the commensal population in Foxo deficient flies. In all tested
genetic backgrounds, loss of Foxo activity in ECs resulted in a strong reduction in CFUs in
old intestines, confirming that chronic Foxo activity contributes significantly to dysbiosis
(Fig. 5A, B, D). Since the FoxoRNAi construct also affects expression of one off-target gene,
nebbish (Karpac et al., 2013), we confirmed that nebbish repression does not impact the
commensal microbiota by specifically targeting nebbish in ECs using a separate nebbish
RNAi construct (Fig. S5C).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Concurrent with the reduced number of commensal bacteria, animals in which Foxo was
suppressed in ECs exhibited significantly reduced ISC proliferation, supporting the idea that
preventing the accumulation of commensals in the aging gut is sufficient to limit dysplasia
(Fig. 5C, E; mitotic figures were not affected by expression of nebbish RNAi, Fig. S5D).
When PGRP-SC2 was knocked down in ECs, in turn, dysbiosis and dysplasia were
increased compared to age-matched wild-type controls (Fig S5A, B). Importantly,
knockdown of Foxo did not rescue age-associated dysplasia in PGRP-SC2 loss of function
conditions (Fig. 5C), confirming epistasis of Foxo and PGRP-SC2 in the control of intestinal
homeostasis.
We further assessed if specifically restoring the expression of PGRP-SC2 in the aging
intestine is sufficient to promote commensal homeostasis and prevent dysplasia. Since
PGRP-SC2 is the most highly expressed PGRP-SC gene in the young gut (based on
RNASeq data, PGRP-SC2 is expressed about 100 times higher in the gut than PGRP-SC1a,
and 500 times higher than PGRP-SC1b), we focused on restoring expression of this gene.
Using two independent PGRP-SC2 transgenes, we found that over-expression of PGRP-SC2
in ECs (using NP1∷Gal4) prevented dysbiosis, limited dpt expression, and reduced
dysplasia (Fig. 6A, B, S6A). Similar reduction in dysbiosis and dysplasia was observed

when PGRP-SC2 was expressed using an EB/EC-specific RU486-inducible driver, 5966GS
(Fig. 6C, S6B)(Mathur et al., 2010).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Since intestinal proliferative homeostasis correlates with longevity (Biteau et al., 2010), we
assessed if promoting innate immune function by expressing PGRP-SC2 in ECs would also
be sufficient to extend lifespan. Indeed, both when expressed constitutively in ECs using
isogenized lines of NP1∷Gal4, or when expressed only in adults in an RU486-inducible
manner using 5966GS, both PGRP-SC2 transgenes were sufficient to significantly extend
Drosophila lifespan compared to isogenic sibling controls (Fig. 6 D–G, S6C). This lifespan
extension by PGRP-SC2 was strongly reduced when animals were reared axenically,
highlighting the critical role of PGRP-SC2-induced changes in the commensal bacterial
population for its effects on mortality (Fig. 6F–G).

Discussion

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Our results provide a model for the development of age-related dysplasia in the aging
intestine, and demonstrate that improving host-commensal interactions in aging barrier
epithelia can promote health and lifespan. We propose that chronic activation of Foxo in
ECs of aging animals initiates a breakdown of IMD/Rel homeostasis by suppressing
expression of SC-class PGRPs, thus compromising the efficacy of the innate immune
response. The resulting dysbiosis, in turn, stimulates an inflammatory response by activating
Duox and promoting ROS production, thus triggering ISC over-proliferation and epithelial
dysplasia (Fig. 7).
While the role of ROS in stimulating ISC proliferation is well established, an alternative
explanation for the effects of reducing bacterial numbers on ISC activity are changes in the
concentration of essential metabolites provided by commensal bacteria. Metabolic
consequences of commensal bacteria are being explored in various contexts (Clemente et al.,
2012; Hooper et al., 2012; Nicholson et al., 2012; Shin et al., 2011; Storelli et al., 2011), and
the effects of bacterial metabolites on ISC activity are a fascinating area to explore in future
studies.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The relationship between Foxo activation, the loss of immune function, dysbiosis, and
intestinal dysplasia highlights the delicate balance that has to be maintained to ensure longterm homeostasis of barrier epithelia. Our observations point to a critical role of SC class
PGRPs in maintaining intestinal homeostasis, a role that is consistent with studies showing
that flies lacking these PGRPs experience deleterious immune responses to innocuous
infections (Paredes et al., 2011). Interestingly, our data suggest that PGRP-SC2 expression
in ECs primarily affects mortality in mid-life, and does not significantly increase maximal
lifespan, indicating that PGRP-SC2-mediated control of intestinal immune homeostasis
primarily affects healthspan of the animal and not the overall rate of aging. This critical role
of amidase PGRPs likely extends to the vertebrate PGRP-SC homologues PGLYRP1-4, as
these promote a normal gut flora and limit inflammation in a rodent model (Saha et al.,
2010). Furthermore, mutations in the peptidoglycan recognition protein NOD2 are some of
the most commonly found gene variants associated with Crohn’s disease, while interactions
between NOD2 and PGLYRPs shape the inflammatory response to microorganisms (Saha et
al., 2009; Sorbara and Philpott, 2011).
Foxo-mediated regulation of innate immune homeostasis and longevity
The age-related repression of PGRP-SCs and the dysbiosis and dysplasia caused by chronic
Foxo activation in fly ECs are reminiscent of inflammatory conditions induced by excessive
or chronic Foxo activation in mammals (Jonsson et al., 2005; Peng, 2010). Foxo activity is
commonly associated with increased lifespan in invertebrates, but can have contextCell. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2015 January 16.

dependent and pleiotropic consequences for cell and tissue function, mediated by a wide
array of Foxo target genes (Becker et al. 2010; Biteau et al., 2011b; Zhang et al., 2013).
Accordingly, Foxo activity has complex consequences for metabolic, immune, and
proliferative homeostasis of the intestinal epithelium: Foxo activation in ISCs or EBs
prevents ISC proliferation, and constitutive activation of Foxo in these cells inhibits
epithelial regeneration and reduces lifespan (Amcheslavsky et al., 2009; Biteau et al., 2010;
Kapuria et al., 2012; McLeod et al., 2010; O'Brien et al., 2011). Over-expression of selected
Foxo target genes in ISCs, in turn, can prevent age-related hyperproliferation of ISCs and
intestinal dysplasia, resulting in lifespan extension (Biteau et al., 2010). In ECs, activation of
Foxo is part of a metabolic response to changing nutrient conditions, but chronic activation
of Foxo in these cells leads to a deregulation of gastric lipases, disrupting lipid homeostasis
in the animal (Karpac et al., 2013). The inhibition of PGRP-SC2 expression reported here
may also constitute an adaptive response to starvation, where Foxo activation boosts the
activity of the IMD/Rel pathway to ensure survival under adverse conditions. The combined
chronic suppression of PGRP-SC2 and gastric lipase expression by Foxo in aging ECs,
however, results in the metabolic and immunological decline of the intestine. Managing
Foxo activity in a cell-type specific manner in barrier epithelia is thus critical to ensure
tissue health and organismal homeostasis. Interestingly, reducing Foxo activity specifically
in ECs, while limiting dysbiosis and dysplasia, does not extend lifespan, but leads to early
mortality (not shown). It is likely that this reflects the need for Foxo-mediated metabolic and
stress adaptation in ECs of young animals (see also (Karpac et al., 2013)).
The reasons for the increase in Foxo activity in aging ECs are currently under investigation,
and we find that JNK signaling appears to contribute to this activation (Karpac et al., 2013).
However, a previous study has shown that age-related activation of JNK in the intestinal
epithelium is dependent on the presence of commensal bacteria, as maintaining animals
axenically reduces activation of JNK in the first 30 days of life (Buchon et al., 2009a). Since
we find that Foxo activity increases with age in both conventionally and axenically reared
animals, it is unlikely that JNK plays an exclusive role in the age-related activation of Foxo
in ECs. Our RNAseq results, which indicate a significant age-related up-regulation of tissue
damage and wounding response genes in both conventionally and axenically reared animals,
suggest that a general accumulation of molecular and tissue damage might contribute to the
activation of Foxo in ECs. Alternatively, local or systemic metabolic imbalances (such as
insulin resistance), may contribute to chronic Foxo activation. Further studies using
axenically reared flies will be necessary to determine the role of JNK, and of other stress
signaling pathways, in elevating Foxo activity in ECs during aging.
Immunosenescence and inflammation in the aging intestine

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

It is likely that the benefits of limiting IMD/Rel signaling for homeostasis of barrier
epithelia are conserved. Chronic inflammation and imbalanced Rel/NFkB signaling are
major risk factors underlying aging and age-related diseases (Chung et al., 2009).
Accordingly, over-activation of Rel/NFkB signaling, which in aging flies occurs both
systemically and in the gut (Libert et al., 2006; Ren et al., 2007), has deleterious
consequences, and has been associated with the pathogenesis of IBDs in vertebrates
(Bonnay et al., 2013; Fukuyama et al., 2005; Kaser et al., 2010; Maillet et al., 2008; Nenci et
al., 2007; Tominaga et al., 2007). Similarly, over-activation of Nox (NADPH oxidase) /
Duox has been implicated in gastric adenocarcinomas in humans (Fukuyama et al., 2005;
Tominaga et al., 2007). Our results indicated that IMD/Rel over-activation in ECs is an agerelated condition that occurs both in conventionally and (albeit in a delayed fashion, see also
(Buchon et al., 2009a)) in axenically reared animals, and thus drives age-related immune
senescence.

It is puzzling that Rel-induced AMPs are vigorously expressed in the gut of old,
conventionally reared animals, while commensal bacteria accumulate. This disconnect
between high levels of AMP expression and bacterial accumulation has been reported before
(Brummel et al., 2004; Libert et al., 2006; Ren et al., 2007), and might reflect the
proliferation of AMP insensitive bacteria, or other, posttranscriptional, perturbations of
AMP function that occur in aging flies. Such perturbations may include a deficiency in
translation, as reported in the intestinal epithelium of animals infected with P. entomophila
(Chakrabarti et al., 2012), or defects in secretion of AMPs. Alternatively, high levels of
AMPs might influence commensal composition, but not overall load, resulting in the
selection of deleterious strains, as has been described for animals deficient for the homeobox
transcription factor Caudal (Ryu et al., 2008). Further studies are needed to resolve this
question.
Extending lifespan by preventing commensal dysbiosis

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Our study demonstrates that regulating host/commensal interactions in barrier epithelia can
significantly delay age-related pathologies and extend lifespan. Previous work has
demonstrated the complex relationship between bacterial load and longevity, establishing
that bacteria can have both beneficial and deleterious consequences for flies, and that
completely eliminating pathogenic and commensal bacteria does not lead to lifespan
extension (Ryu et al., 2008; Shin et al., 2011; Storelli et al., 2011; Brummel et al., 2004; Ren
et al., 2007). We show here, however, that lifespan extension can be achieved by improving
innate immune homeostasis to stabilize the gut microbiota rather than by eliminating all
bacteria from the gut. The fact that PGRP-SC2 over-expression fails to extend lifespan in
axenic conditions supports this interpretation. Recently identified age-related changes in the
human commensal population (Claesson et al., 2011; Claesson et al., 2012) indicate that
such interventions may be able to also allay age-related pathologies and increase health- and
lifespan in humans (Biagi et al., 2013; Ottaviani et al., 2011).

Materials and Methods
Drosophila stocks and culture

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The following strains were obtained from the Bloomington Drosophila Stock Center: w1118,
y1w1, OreR, NP1∷Gal4, tub-Gal80ts. UAS-FoxoRNAi (transformant ID 106097-CG3143),
UAS-NebbishRNAi (108138-CG10718), and UAS-PGRP-SC2RNAi (6444) were obtained
from the Vienna Drosophila RNAi Center. foxoW24 (gift from M. Tatar) was backcrossed
into y1w1 background for 10 generations to obtain foxo+/+, foxow24/+ and foxow24/w24 flies.
UAS-Foxo was a gift from M. Tatar. UAS-PGRP-SC2 transgenic lines were generated as
described in Supplemental Information. Flies were raised on standard yeast/molasses based
food (see Supplemental data for recipe).
Axenic fly cultures were generated with or without antibiotics as described in (Bakula,
1969; Brummel et al., 2004; Ryu et al., 2008). See Supplemental Methods for detailed
description.
Immunostaining and microscopy
Intact guts were dissected, fixed, and stained by immunohistochemistry following standard
protocols. See Supplemental Information for details.
RNAseq analysis
Intact fly intestines were dissected in PBS. Total RNA was extracted using Trizol reagent
and used as template to generate RNASeq libraries for Illumina sequencing. Illumina HiSeq

sequencing was performed at the University of Rochester Genomics Core Facility. Between
6 and 10 Million 72bp reads were generated and mapped to the Drosophila genome Release
5.46. Expression was recorded as RPKM: reads per kbp per million reads.
qRT-PCR analysis
Total RNA was extracted from dissected guts (7 per sample) using Trizol, and cDNA was
synthesized using Superscript II (Invitrogen). Real time PCR was performed on a Biorad
IQ5 system. See Supplemental Methods for details.
Bacteria culture and commensal quantification
Serratia Marcescens (NO. 21074) and Erwinia Carotovora Carotovora (NO. 15359) strains
were obtained from ATCC.
To culture commensal bacteria, dissected midguts were homogenized in 100µl PBS and
plated onto selective plates (see recipes in Supplemental Methods). Plates were incubated at
30°C for 36 – 48 hours.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Oral infection was performed as described (Buchon et al., 2010). Flies were fed for 24 hours
either 700µl of concentrated bacteria cultures (OD100) or an equal volume of 5% sucrose as
control. At least 3 vials (cohorts of 15 flies per vial) were used for each genotype. See
Supplemental Methods for clearance experiments.
Lifespan analysis
60 virgins (5966∷GS homozygotes or w1118;NP1∷Gal4/+ heterozygotes) were crossed to
10–15 w1118;UAS∷PGRP-SC2 homozygous males (backcrossed 7 generations into w1118)
or w1118 males. Progeny of these crosses was collected for 4 to 5 days after the first fly
hatched. Flies were allowed to mate for 2 days at room temperature. Siblings were then
separated according to sex and genotype into cages (20–50 flies/cage) and aged at 25°C.
Dem ographic data was analyzed using Prism statistical software. See supplemental methods
for additional fly handling information.

Figure 7. Model for the age-related deregulation of innate immune and epithelial homeostasis in
the Drosophila intestine

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

A) Model depicting the relationship between age, commensal dysbiosis, and intestinal
dysplasia. Our results indicate that when intestinal CFUs and associated Duox expression
reach a threshold, ISCs overproliferate, causing dysplasia. Over-expression of PGRP-SC2
delays the accumulation of commensals, resulting in delayed acquisition of dysplasia,
extending lifespan.
B, C) Proposed mechanism causing immune dysfunction and commensal dysbiosis in the fly
intestine. In young animals, PGRP-SC2 maintains immune homeostasis by limiting IMD/
Rel activity. Foxo-mediated suppression of PGRP-SC2 allows adjusting responsiveness and
basal activity of IMD/Rel. Age-associated chronic activation of Foxo in ECs, in turn,
represses PGRP-SC2 expression chronically, de-regulating IMD/Rel signaling. The
associated immunosenescence causes commensal dysbiosis, which chronically activates
Duox – mediated ROS production, triggering ISC over-proliferation and dysplasia.
