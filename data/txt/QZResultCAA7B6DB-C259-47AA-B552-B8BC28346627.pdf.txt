ABSTRACT
Increases in fatty acid metabolism have been demonstrated to promote the
growth and survival of a variety of cancers, including prostate cancer (PCa). Here, we
examine the expression and function of the fatty acid activating enzyme, long-chain
fatty acyl-CoA synthetase 4 (ACSL4), in PCa. Ectopic expression of ACSL4 in ACSL4negative PCa cells increases proliferation, migration and invasion, while ablation of
ACSL4 in PCa cells expressing endogenous ACSL4 reduces cell proliferation, migration
and invasion. The cell proliferative effects were observed both in vitro, as well as in
vivo. Immunohistochemical analysis of human PCa tissue samples indicated ACSL4
expression is increased in malignant cells compared with adjacent benign epithelial
cells, and particularly increased in castration-resistant PCa (CRPC) when compared
with hormone naive PCa. In cell lines co-expressing both ACSL4 and AR, proliferation
was independent of exogenous androgens, suggesting that ACSL4 expression may
lead to CRPC. In support for this hypothesis, ectopic ACSL4 expression induced
resistance to treatment with Casodex, via decrease in apoptosis. Our studies further
indicate that ACSL4 upregulates distinct pathway proteins including p-AKT, LSD1
and β-catenin. These results suggest ACSL4 could serve as a biomarker and potential
therapeutic target for CRPC.

INTRODUCTION

by the loss of androgen receptor (AR) expression
or transcriptional activity, and AR activity remains
critical for tumor growth in CRPC [1]. AR expression
is typically increased in CRPC [1], with restoration of
AR activity through a variety of mechanisms including
AR amplification and overexpression, AR mutation
(mostly in the ligand-binding domain, conferring ligand
promiscuity), increased intratumoral androgen synthesis,

Although, androgen ablation therapy remains the
standard of treatment for recurrent and metastatic PCa,
most cases treated with ablation therapy will evolve into
castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), the primary
cause of prostate cancer-related death. Importantly, the
failure of androgen deprivation therapy is not accompanied

androgen-independent AR activation by cytokines and
growth factors and constitutively active AR splice variants.
Increased expression of the fatty acid biosynthetic
enzymes ATP: citrate lyase (ACLY), acetyl Co-A
carboxylase (ACC) and fatty acid synthase (FASN) in a
variety of tumors, including those that develop in prostate
tissue, suggests a role for altered lipid metabolism in the
genesis of a malignant phenotype [2]. De novo synthesis of
free fatty acids and subsequent metabolic events, such as
glycerolipid synthesis and β-oxidation, requires activation
through condensation with a molecule of Coenzyme
A (CoA). The enzymes responsible for the activation
reaction comprise a family of proteins known as fatty acylCoA synthetases that are classified according to the chain
length of their preferred substrates (short, medium, long,
and very long) [3]. ACSL4 is a long-chain fatty acyl-CoA
synthetase with a marked preference for arachidonic and
eicosapentaenoic acid as substrates [4, 5]. Interestingly,
ACSL4 is overexpressed in colon and liver cancer
specimens compared to its low level expression in benign
colon and liver [6-8]. Previous work from our laboratory
has demonstrated an inverse relationship between the
expression of ACSL4 and AR/ ER in breast cancer cell
lines and tissue samples; the data further suggested that coexpression of both a receptor and ACSL4 was indicative
of hormone-independent growth [9, 10]. In ER-negative
breast tumor samples, high ACSL4 expression predicted
a shorter time to distant metastases [9] and was highest in
triple negative breast cancer cell lines and tumor samples
that lacked AR receptors [10]. With respect to function,
we and others have demonstrated that forced expression
of ACSL4 in ER-positive MCF7 cells results in increased
proliferation, migration and invasion in vitro as well as
increased growth in in vivo xenograft models [10-12].
These data raise the question of the function of ACSL4
enzyme activity in mediating the aggressive phenotype
associated with hormone independence in PCa.
In this study, we investigate the function of ACSL4
in human PCa cell proliferation and invasion. Our results
indicate that ACSL4 expression is able to induce a more
aggressive phenotype of PCa and may be useful as a
biomarker for castration resistance and/or a target for
treatment.

DU-145 cells express relatively high levels of ACSL4.
AR-positive, androgen-independent LNCaP-AI and C42B cells express moderate levels of ACSL4. Figure 1B
further illustrates the inverse relationship between AR and
ACSL4 mRNA expression in a series of 16 PCa cell lines,
as detailed in Table 1.
To explore the dynamics of the inverse relationship
between ACSL4 expression and AR, we first forced
expression of ACSL4 in ACSL4-negative LNCaP cells.
As demonstrated in Figure 1C, ectopic ACSL4 expression
resulted in a decrease in AR expression at both the mRNA
and protein levels. Alternatively, when ACSL4 expression
in LNCaP-AI cells was abolished by treatment with
siRNA, the expression of AR was increased (Figure 1D).
This inverse relationship was also observed in stromal
cells, which normally express ACSL4. Ecotopic AR
expression in prostate stromal cells resulted in decreased
ACSL4 expression at both the mRNA and protein levels
(Figure 1E). Ectopic expression of AR in AR-negative
PC3 cells likewise led to a reduction in ACSL4 expression
(Figure 1F). Interestingly, ACSL4 and AR expression
levels were increased when LNCaP-ACSL4 cells and
LNCaP-AI cells were cultured in androgen-containing
medium (Figure 1G and 1H). Similar observation is also
found in VCaP cells (Supplemental Figure 1)

Expression of ACSL4 in PCa tissue
We next studied the expression of ACSL4 protein
in human PCa tissue samples by immunohistochemical
analysis of a human PCa TMA derived from a cohort
of PCa patients (n = 155) in various clinicopathological
groups and benign prostate tissue (n = 124). We first
examined the expression of cytoplasmic ACSL4 in benign
and malignant prostatic epithelial cells (Figure 1I). The
mean expression Allred score of cytoplasmic ACSL4
was increased in PCa by 1.3-fold compared to the benign
tissues (p < 0.0001) (Figure 1J). A similar pattern was
observed in the expression intensity score and percentage
score (data not shown). Among the PCa patients with
high stage (Stage III) PCa, ACSL4 expression percentage
scores were significantly higher than those with a low
stage (Stage I or II) cancer (p = 0.04). PCa patients with
positive surgical margins showed increased ACSL4
expression intensity scores when compared to marginnegative cases (p = 0.04). The cases of hormone-resistant
PCa showed significantly higher intensity scores for
expression of ACSL4 in the cytoplasm compared to
hormone-naive cases (p = 0.04) (Figure 1K), although the
Allred score showed no significant difference. There was
no significant difference in ACSL4 expression with respect
to other clinicopathologic parameters studied, including
age, Gleason score, PSA level and recurrence, and clinical
follow-up. Finally, ACSL4 expression levels in African
American patients are significantly higher than those in
Caucasian patients (p = 0.04) (Supplemental Figure 2).

RESULTS
Expression of ACSL4 in PCa cells
As previously reported in both PCa cell lines
and tissue samples [9] there is an inverse relationship
between ACSL4 and AR expression. Figure 1A extends
this observation to additional cell lines. AR-positive,
androgen-dependent LNCaP cells fail to express ACSL4,
while AR-negative, androgen-independent PC3 and

ACSL4 promotes PCa growth and invasion

Prostate stromal cells [13] normally express ACSL4
(Figure 1E), so we next questioned whether expression
of ACSL4 in prostate stromal cells might influence the
growth of neighboring tumor cells through paracrine
signaling, possibly such as by prostaglandin E2 (PGE2)
production [14]. We first established a stable prostate
stromal cell line with overexpression of ACSL4 to
study its effects on the proliferation of prostate stromal
cells under the same conditions described for previous
experiments with LNCaP and LNCaP-AI cells. Results
were similar to those observed in LNCaP cells, but effects
were reduced in magnitude, which is not surprising since
stromal cells express endogenous ACSL4 (Figure 2G-2I).
Pro-proliferative effects of ACSL4 in stromal cells were
greatest in complete medium (p < 0.0001). To determine
if ACSL4 expression in prostate stromal cells affects
neighboring PCa cell growth in vitro, we performed
proliferation assays using transwell indirect co-culture

As shown in Figure 1A, LNCaP cells do not
endogenously express ACSL4 protein. To examine the
effect of ACSL4 expression in LNCaP cells, we utilized
a Lentiviral expression system to create LNCaP-ACSL4
cells. When compared with control cells, LNCaP-ACSL4
cells exhibited an increased rate of proliferation in
complete medium (p < 0.0001), as well as in hormone-free
medium without (p < 0.0001), or with (p < 0.0001), added
androgen (Figure 2A-2C). Additionally, we measured
the effect of decreasing ACSL4 expression by siRNA
treatment in the ACSL4-positive, AR positive androgenindependent, LNCaP-AI cells. When endogenous ACSL4
expression is ablated, the rate of proliferation is decreased
compared with siRNA controls under all conditions (p
< 0.0001 in complete medium, androgen-supplemented
medium and hormone-free medium) (Figure 2D-2F).

assays of stromal ACSL4 and control cells with PC3 and
LNCaP cells. No significant effect on PCa growth was
observed (p = 0.339 and p = 0.619) (Supplemental Figure
3).
We next examined the effect of ACSL4 expression
on the anchorage-independent growth of LNCaP cells. We
observed that ACSL4 expression increased the number
and size of colonies compared with the control vectortransfected LNCaP cells. As shown in Figure 2J-2L, there
was a 3-fold increase in colony number and colony size in
ACSL4-expressing LNCaP cells (p < 0.0001).
To determine whether the positive growth regulatory
effects of ACLS4 expression on LNCaP cells could be
observed in vivo, we performed subcutaneous tumor
xenograft experiments using immunodeficient nude mice.
We observed a significantly increased rate of tumor growth
in LNCaP xenografts expressing ACSL4 (n = 10 mice per
group per clone) (Figure 2M) compared to vector controls
(n = 10) (p < 0.0001) consistent with the data derived from
in vitro experiments.
We next examined the migration and invasion
ability of LNCaP cells stably transfected with ACSL4.
We observed increased migration of LNCaP-ACSL4 cells
compared to control cells (Figure 3E). Increased ACSL4
expression also increased the number of invading cells
by Matrigel invasion assay (Figure 3A, 3B and 3F). The
invasion index, determined by percentage of invasion
of test cells (LNCaP-ACSL4) over that of control cells
(LNCaP), was 2.2. When ACSL4-positive PC3 cells were
treated with ACSL4 siRNA, the migration and invasion
capabilities were decreased significantly (Figure 3C, 3D,
3G and 3H). The invasion index was 0.35.

LNCaP-control and LNCaP-ACSL4 cells. As shown in
Figure 4C, the ability of Casodex to increase BAX and
CASP-8 expression was abolished as a result of ACSL4
expression. In addition, ACSL4 expression reduced CASP8 expression even in the absence of Casodex. Interestingly,
AKT phosphorylation was significantly increased as a
result of ACSL4 expression, although there did not appear
to be any difference in the ability of Casodex to inhibit
either AKT expression or phosphorylation.

Pathway proteins affected by ACSL4
To explore the effect of ACSL4 on pathway proteins
at a global level in PCa cells, we further evaluated protein
expression as a function of ACSL4 expression using
Protein Pathway Array Analysis (PPAA) to compare
LNCaP control and LNCaP ACSL4-expressing cells [18].
Results are shown in Table 2. Of 199 pathway proteins
examined [19], there were 9 proteins with increased and 10
proteins with decreased expression and/or phosphorylation
levels. For example, there was a 5.26-fold increase in the
level of LSD1 (Lysine-specific histone demethylase 1), a
4.98-fold increase in β-catenin, and more than two-fold
increase in the levels of p-PKC α/βII, CDK4, HIF-3α,
ADH, Calretinin and EGFR. We confirmed the changes
in protein expression level for these findings by western
blot (Figure 5A). Additionally, we previously reported
decreased XIST and AUTS2 mRNA expression in breast
cancer cells as a result of forced ACSL4 expression [10].
When we assessed the expression of XIST and AUTS2
in PCa in relation to ACSL4, we observed that both
XIST and AUTS2 mRNA were decreased in LNCaP cells
expressing ACSL4 (Figure 5A).
To determine the functional relevance of some of
these protein alterations with respect to the proliferative
action of ACSL4 on PCa, we examined the effect of
ablating these proteins on the growth of PCa cells
expressing high levels of ACSL4. The results shown
in Figure 5B indicate that reduction in LSD1 caused a
significant reduction in the growth of LNCaP-ACSL4
cells (p < 0.0001) but no significant effect on LNCaP
control cells. The proliferation of LNCaP-ACSL4 cells
was also decreased after β-catenin siRNA treatment (p
= 0.012) (Figure 5C); However, the same difference was
observed in control LNCaP cells, so this effect could be
independent of ACSL4. There was no difference observed
in proliferation in either LNCaP-ACSL4 cells or control
cells as a result of siRNA-induced downregulation of PKC
/β (Figure 5D). The GSK3 expression level was decreased
in LNCaP-ACSL4 cells compared with the LNCaP vector
control cells (Figure 5E), while the GSK3 expression level
was increased in LNCaP-AI cells treated with ACSL4
specific siRNA (Figure 5F).

High levels of ACSL4 mediate CRPC
To elucidate the effect of ACSL4 on anti-androgen
therapy, we first treated LNCaP control and ACSL4expressing cells with Casodex at different concentrations
followed by flow cytometry-based cell cycle analysis.
As shown in Figure 4A, ACSL4 expression reduced the
sensitivity of LNCaP cells to the effects of Casodex,
inhibiting the ability of Casodex to block entry into the
S phase of the cell cycle. Interestingly, there were fewer
pre-G1 apoptotic cells in LNCaP cells expressing ACSL4
as a result of Casodex treatment. The ability of ACSL4
to reduce apoptosis induced by Casodex treatment was
confirmed by measuring apoptosis using the Apo-ONE ®
Homogeneous Caspase-3/7 Assay (Figure 4B). The ability
of Casodex to induce apoptosis has previously been shown
to involve BAX and Caspase-8 [15] and the effect on the
cell cycle appears to involve Cdc6, cyclin A, and cyclin B
[16]. A decrease in Akt phosphorylation in PCa cells may
mediate the mechanism of action of Casodex [17]. These
cell cycle and apoptotic related proteins were analyzed
via immunoblot after Casodex treatment at 150 µM on

DISCUSSION

Previous studies, both in vitro [7-12, 22-24] and in vivo
[25], have demonstrated that inhibition of the activity of
these enzymes inhibits growth and survival of cancer cells.
We have previously demonstrated an inverse relationship
between sex steroid receptor(s) (AR and ER) expression
and ACSL4 expression in both breast cancer and PCa [9].
The data with respect to breast cancer suggest that ACSL4,
when co-expressed with estrogen receptor, is indicative
of resistance to hormone-based targeted treatments in
breast cancer [10]. ACSL4 expression in PCa cell lines is
inversely associated with expression of AR, and, when coexpressed with AR correlates with androgen independent
growth (Figure 1A and 1B). Furthermore, forced
expression of ACSL4 in AR-positive, ACSL4-negative
LNCaP cells results in a reduced expression of AR (Figure
1C), while inhibition of ACSL4 expression in LNCaPAI cells results in increased AR expression. Conversely,
forced expression of AR in ACSL4-positive, AR-negative

The malignant transformation of normal cells,
including prostatic epithelial cells, is accompanied
by alterations in intermediary metabolism, including
increased glucose utilization and enhanced lipogenesis.
To date, attempts to exploit enhanced lipogenesis in the
development of treatment modalities have yielded limited
clinical application [20]. Previous studies have primarily
focused on the fatty acid synthetic enzyme, FASN, as a
potential target [21].
In this study we identify the fatty acid activating
enzyme, ACSL4, as a potential biomarker for CRPC
and target for treatment in a subset of PCa. The longchain fatty-acyl-CoA synthetase family of 5 isoenzymes
functions to activate long-chain fatty acids prior to
their utilization, either as substrates for triglyceride and
phospholipid synthesis, or as substrates for β oxidation.

PC3 cells causes a decrease in ACSL4 expression
(Figure 1F). Interestingly, in cells co-expressing AR and
ACSL4 (LNCaP-ACSL4 and LNCaP-AI) treatment with
androgens increased both ACSL4 and AR expression
(Figure 1G and 1H). The overall pattern of expression of
ACSL4 in PCa cell lines indicates that ACSL4 expression

is associated with a more aggressive phenotype. Of
note, androgen treatment induces the expression of both
ACSL4 and AR in LNCaP-AI and VCaP cells. The
simultaneous increase in AR and ACSL4 may represent
underlying drive of androgen ablation resistance though
the mechanism remains to be determined. Assessment of

ACSL4 expression in human PCa tissue samples supports
this notion (Figure 1I-1K) that expression is increased
in castration resistant as compared with hormone naive
samples.
We assessed the effects of ACSL4 expression on cell
functions by either forcing expression in ACSL4-negative
LNCaP cells, or inhibiting expression in ACSL4-positive
LNCaP-AI cells. Under all growth conditions (complete
media or charcoaled-stripped media with or without
androgen) expression of ACSL4 conferred a growth
advantage (Figure 2). This proliferative advantage was
also observed for anchorage-independent growth with
increased colony size and number (Figure 2). Similar
results were observed in vivo (Figure 2M). Cell migration
and invasion were likewise enhanced by expression of
ACSL4 (Figure 3). The growth advantage that resulted
from ACSL4 expression is also accompanied by an
increased resistance to treatment with the anti-androgen,
Casodex. LNCaP cells expressing ACSL4 failed to
increase BAX and Caspase-8 expression in the presence
of Casodex (Figure 4).
A proteomic pathway array analysis comparing
LNCaP and LNCaP-ACSL4 cells indicated a number of
signaling proteins were affected by ACSL4 expression
(Table 2). We examined the effect of ablating three of
these proteins (LSD1, β-catenin and PKC α/βII) on cell
growth. We found LSD1 ablation to specifically reverse
the growth promotion by ACSL4 in LNCaP cells (Figure
5B). Previous studies have demonstrated that LSD1
stimulates proliferation of both androgen-dependent and
androgen-independent cell lines [26, 27], and combined
with our results, indicate that ACSL4 may promote
proliferation by activation of LSD1 in PCa cells.
ACSL4 has a preference for arachidonic acid as
substrate and treatment of PC3 cells with arachidonic
acid has previously been shown to result in increased
AKT phosphorylation [28]. Together with our data
showing increased ACSL4 leading to increased p-AKT,
this suggests ACSL4 effects may be mediated through
its enzymatic interaction with arachidonic acid. In both
breast cancer cells [11] and human arterial smooth
muscle cells [29] forced expression of ACSL4 results
in increased accumulation of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2),
and prostaglandins have been implicated in PCa [30, 31].
Tjandrawinata et al have reported that PGE2 increases
growth of prostate cancer cells and upregulates expression
of its own synthesizing enzyme, COX-2 [32]. Thus, the
PGE2 that results from expression of ACSL4 activity
might exert an autocrine effect on prostate cancer cells,
interacting with surface receptors to activate PI3K/pAKT
[33]. The increased level of pAKT might then function
to down-regulate AR expression, as has been shown
previously [34-36].
In summary, we have presented data that confirm
an association between AR expression and ACSL4
expression in human PCa. More specifically, we have
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

provided evidence that ACSL4 expression is more closely
associated with hormone-independent growth and may
be a useful marker in determining response to hormonal
therapy. In addition, it may be possible to target ACSL4 in
the treatment of CRPC.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture, flow cytometry, cell proliferation,
anchorage-independent cell growth and in vitro
Matrigel invasion assays
LNCaP cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 (Life
Technologies) with 10% heat-inactivated bovine serum
(fetal bovine serum). LNCaP-ACSL4 stable cells were
constructed by lentiviral infection, using lentiviral-ACSL4
viral particles purchased from Invitrogen. The viruscontaining solution was added to LNCaP cells and the
stable cells were selected. Immunoblot was performed to
demonstrate ACSL4 overexpression.
Cell cycle analysis was performed on FACSCalibur
flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) and analyzed using
Weasel software (The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of
Medical Research, Melbourne, Australia). Cells were
prepared for flow cytometry as described previously
[37]. Invasion assays were performed using BD Matrigel
invasion chambers and 5% FBS was used as the
chemoattractant in the lower chamber. Cells (5 x 104) were
incubated for 24 h before they were stained and counted.
For invasion assays, the percentage of invasion was
expressed as the ratio of invading cells over cell number
normalized on day 2 of the growth curve.
Cell proliferation and invasion kinetics were
measured by WST assay (Roche), and Matrigel invasion
assays were performed as described previously [37-39].
For cell proliferation assays, regular medium is RPMI1640
containing phenol red, plus 10% fetal bovine serum,
hormone free medium is phenol red-free RPMI1640 plus
10% charcoal stripped fetal bovine serum, and androgen
medium is phenol red-free RPMI1640 plus 10% charcoal
stripped fetal bovine serum containing 10 nM R1881. For
co-culture experiments [13], epithelial cells were grown
in Transwell inserts in 24-well plates above the stromal
cells seeded on the lower plate. All experiments were
performed in triplicate. The number of cells was counted
every other day for 8 days.
Anchorage-independent cell growth in soft agar was
performed in triplicate with cells (4x104) suspended in 2ml
of medium containing 0.35% agar (Becton Dickinson)
spread on top of 5ml of 0.7% solidified agar. Total
numbers of colonies were counted.

internal standards.

Nude mice xenografts

Cells were plated in T-25 flasks in complete medium
lacking antibiotic and allowed to attach overnight. Cell
densities at the start of the experiment were between 30%
and 60% confluency. Transfection of small interfering
RNA (siRNA; either control or ACSL4-specific Smart
Pool siRNA purchased from Dharmacon, Lafayette,
CO) into cells was accomplished using Lipofectamine
RNAiMAX (Invitrogen) according to the protocol
recommended by the manufacturer. Transfections were
tested after 48 hour incubation.

Male nude mice (4 weeks old) were purchased from
Charles River and maintained in accordance with the
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee-approved
protocol. 1 X 107cells were used for subcutaneous injection
with Matrigel ECM (reconstituted basement membrane)
to support tumor growth [37]. Each experimental group
contained 10 mice. Tumors were measured with calipers
every two days.

Immunoblot analysis

PCa tissue microarray (TMA)

Whole cell extracts were subjected to SDSPAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane for
Western blot analysis. Blots were incubated with primary
antibodies (AR, ER-α, and β-actin, Cell Signaling
Technology, Inc.; ACSL4, Epitomic Inc) overnight at 4°
C, washed with TBS-T, and incubated for 1 hour with the
horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody
(1:5000; Amersham Biosciences). The protein bands
were detected by an enhanced chemiluminescence kit
(Amersham Biosciences). GAPDH and β-actin served as
reference genes for normalization of ACSL4 expression.

TMA of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded PCa
were obtained from a cohort of 155 PCa patients managed
by the New York University Langone Medical Center
and the Department of Veterans Affairs New York Harbor
Healthcare System (Manhattan), New York, NY between
1990 - 2005. The clinicopathological parameters were
collected, including age, race, tumor stage and grade
(Gleason score), PSA level and recurrence, margin
status, and clinical follow-up. The hematoxylin-eosin
stained slides were reviewed by two pathologists. Tumor
staging was done according to the current American
Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging criteria. The
Gleason score and tumor staging were assigned according
to modified criteria [41]. The benign controls (n = 124)
were obtained from the benign prostatic tissue of PCa
cases from the same cohort. The study was approved by
NYU IRB under exempt category.

Caspase activity assay
To determine the effect of ACSL4 on apoptosis
after LNCaP cells were treated with Casodex, the cells
were subjected to Caspase 3/7 activity measurement
with Caspase-Glo assay kit (Promega, Madison USA).
Briefly, the plates containing cells were removed from the
incubator and allowed to equilibrate to room temperature
for 30 minutes. 100 μl of Caspase-Glo reagent was added
to each well, the content of the well was gently mixed
with a plate shaker at 300-500 rpm for 30 seconds. The
plate was then incubated at room temperature for 8 hours.
The luminescence of each sample was measured in a
plate-reading luminometer (Thermo Labsystems) with
parameters of 1 minute lag time and 0.5 second/well read
time. The experiments were performed in triplicate and
repeated on two separately-initiated cultures.

Immunohistochemistry
Immunohistochemistry was performed using
affinity-purified antibodies against ASCL4 (Santa Cruz,
Dallas, TX). Paraffin-embedded tissue sections were
dewaxed in xylene, rehydrated, and washed in Phosphate
-buffered saline, pH 7.4. For antigen retrieval, paraffin
sections were heated in a microwave oven (900 watts)
in 10 mM citrate buffer followed by treatment with 3%
H2O2 and blocking with 20% normal goat serum. Sections
were then incubated with antibody against ASCL4 (1:100
dilution), followed by incubation with a biotinylated rabbit
secondary antibody (1:1000, Vector Labs, Burlingame,
CA) An avidin-biotin complex was formed and developed
using diaminobenzidine chromagen, followed by a
counter-stain with hematoxylin.
Immunohistochemical staining was examined and
scored independently and in a blinded manner by two
pathologists using the Allred immunohistochemistry score
system [42]. Intensity levels, from 0 (as negative) to 3 (as
strong), of cytoplasmic expression and percentage score, 0

Protein pathway array analysis (PPAA)
PPA analysis was performed as described previously
[40], and antibodies were obtained from a number of
sources [19]. The blot was hybridized with secondary
horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies (Bio-Rad)
and chemiluminescence signal was detected using the
ChemiDocXRS System. Differences in protein levels were
analyzed by densitometric scanning and normalized using
