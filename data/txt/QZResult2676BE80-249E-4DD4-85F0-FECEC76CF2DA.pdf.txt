BACKGROUND: In extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (SCLC), the combination of pemetrexed plus carboplatin
has shown activity and appeared to be well-tolerated. We conducted a trial to confirm the efficacy and to assess the
tolerability of this chemotherapy combination. METHODS: Patients with untreated extensive-stage SCLC were
enrolled in this phase 2 open-labeled study. They receive pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 and carboplatin (area under the
curve of 5) every 21 days for a maximum 6 cycles. The primary endpoint for this trial was the confirmed response
rate and the accrual goal was 70 patients. RESULTS: Forty-six eligible patients (29 aged <70 years, 17 aged 70
years) were accrued to this study. The efficacy outcomes were similar between the 2 age groups. Overall, the confirmed response rate was 35% (16 of 46; 95% confidence interval [CI], 21%-50%), where all 16 were partial responses.
On the basis of these results, we had strong evidence that the study would not meet the preset efficacy criteria and
was, therefore, closed before full accrual. The median duration of response was 4.4 months (95% CI, 2.9-5.2). Median
overall survival for patients aged <70 years and aged 70 years was 9.2 months (95% CI, 5.4-11.6) and 10.8 months
(95% CI, 2.2-14.3), respectively. Grade 3 or higher toxicity rates were similar between the younger and older patients.
Grade 3/4 and grade 4 hematological toxicities were observed in 46% and 26% of patients, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Although well-tolerated, the combination of pemetrexed and carboplatin is not as effective as standard therC 2010 American Cancer Society.

Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) accounts for approximately 15% of all types of lung cancers.1 According to the Veterans’
Administration Lung Cancer Group 2-stage classification system, more than two thirds of patients with SCLC are diagnosed with extensive disease also known as extensive stage, defined as a tumor not confined to one hemithorax or that has
malignant pleural effusion.2 In patients with extensive-stage SCLC, median survival ranges from 7 months to 12 months,
with <5% of patients living beyond 2 years and a 5-year survival rate of 1% to 2%.3,4 Although therapy has significantly
improved outcomes of patients with SCLC, long-term survival remains poor.
This tumor is very responsive to initial chemotherapy, with major responses in 70% to 90% of cases. Combination
chemotherapy is capable of inducing a rapid tumor regression and improved survival, but relapse and death from chemoresistant disease occurs in 80% to 90% of patients. In extensive-stage SCLC, treatment mainly comprises platinum-based
chemotherapy, which has shown a significant survival advantage compared with patients who did not receive a platinum
agent.5 Cisplatin/etoposide remains the first-line therapy for this disease, although carboplatin/etoposide is an acceptable
alternative, with equivalent efficacy and less nonhematologic toxicity for patients intolerant of cisplatin.6 Based on the

current treatment regimens, overall response rates of 50%
to 80% and complete response rates of 0% to 30% have
been achieved in patients with extensive-stage SCLC.5,7 A
randomized phase 3 study in Japanese patients showed
improved survival with cisplatin/irinotecan compared
with cisplatin/etoposide. Median survival times were 12.8
months and 9.4 months, and 2-year survival rates were
19.5% and 5.2%, respectively.8 However, 2 US studies
could not confirm the results.9,10 Other chemotherapy
combinations such as oral topotecan/cisplatin have been
tested and found to be inferior to cisplatin/etoposide.11
Another randomized phase 3 study evaluated the efficacy
of carboplatin/irinotecan and carboplatin/oral etoposide.
Median survival times were 8.5 months and 7.1 months,
and 1-year survival rates were 35% and 24%, respectively.12 With the lack of substantial improvement in
treatment results, there is a great need for new, active
agents against SCLC.
Pemetrexed is a multitargeted antifolate agent that
has been approved for treatment of malignant mesothelioma and nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Its mechanism of action is the inhibition of thymidylate synthase
(TS), dihydrofolate reductase and glycinamide ribonucleotide formyl transferase, enzymes, which are involved
in pyrimidine and purine synthesis.13-16 In vitro, pemetrexed and platinum compounds have additive killing
effect on human SCLC cell line.17 Socinski et al performed a small and limited institution phase 2 trial with
pemetrexed and carboplatin in patients with extensivestage SCLC and showed a median survival time of 10.4
months with a 1-year survivorship of 39% and a response
rate of 39.5% (95% confidence interval [CI], 24.056.6).18 The chemotherapy combination was well tolerated with grade 3/4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia
reported at 20% and 22.9%, respectively. The goal of our
study was to establish the efficacy of this regimen in a cooperative group setting and to evaluate the tolerability of
this combination in all patients, especially the elderly.
Often, elderly patients may experience more toxicity with
treatment because of pre-existing illnesses, decreased
clearance of chemotherapy, and limited marrow
reserves.19

acid, vitamin B12 supplementation or dexamethasone,
and permanently discontinue aspirin dose 1.3 g/day for
10 days before and after pemetrexed disodium treatment. The disease was required to be measurable with at
least 1 lesion, whose longest diameter can be accurately
measured as 2.0 cm with conventional techniques or as
1.0 cm with spiral computer tomography (CT). An
Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 to 2 and adequate hematologic, renal, and
hepatic function were required (hemoglobin, 9.0 g/dL;
absolute neutrophil count, 1500/lL; platelet count,
100 000/lL; creatinine clearance, 45 mL/min using
the Cockcroft-Gault formula20; total bilirubin, 1.5 
upper limits of normal [ULN] or direct bilirubin ULN;
and transaminases, 3  ULN or 5  ULN if liver
involvement). Patients with cytologically proven malignant pleural effusions were eligible but clinically significant effusions had to be drained before treatment (eg,
symptomatic pleural effusion). Palliative radiation therapy except to the chest was allowed with patients enrolled
and chemotherapy starting 1 day after completion of
radiotherapy.
Patients with central nervous system (CNS) metastases treated with whole brain radiation (WBRT) could
be enrolled after completion of WBRT, with chemotherapy beginning as early as the next day after completion
of WBRT. However, patients with symptomatic,
untreated, or uncontrolled CNS metastases or seizure
disorder were excluded. The study also excluded patients
with clinically significant infection, active second
primary malignancy, concurrent chemotherapy, immunotherapy, hormonal therapy or radiotherapy, uncontrolled hypertension with medications, poorly controlled
diabetes mellitus, extensive and symptomatic interstitial
fibrosis of the lung, use of St. John’s Wort, and use of
medications known to be strong inducers or inhibitors
CYP3A4 metabolism. Other contraindications included
pregnancy, major surgery, open biopsy, or significant
traumatic injury 4 weeks before registration, minor
surgery 2 weeks before registration, or any of the following concurrent and/or uncontrolled medical conditions: hypertension, angina pectoris, history of
congestive heart failure 3 months, unless ejection fraction >40%, cardiac arrhythmias, myocardial infarction
3 months, poorly controlled diabetes, interstitial pneumonia, or extensive and symptomatic interstitial fibrosis
of the lung. The institutional review board of each study
site approved the study and informed consent was
obtained from each trial participant.

Study Design and Treatment
This study was a phase 2, open-labeled trial. Patients had
to take folic acid at 350-1000 lg by mouth daily for at
least 5 of the 7 days immediately preceding the first dose
of pemetrexed disodium until 3 weeks after the last dose
of pemetrexed disodium. Vitamin B12 intramuscular
injection at 1000 lg was administered on the same day as
the start of folic acid or 7 days before the first dose of
pemetrexed disodium if the patient was on an adequate
vitamin supplement. The injections were continued every
9 weeks until 3 weeks after the last dose of pemetrexed
disodium. Oral dexamethasone at 4 mg twice a day was
started the day before, day of, and day after all doses of
pemetrexed disodium every 21 days. On Day 1 of each
cycle, pemetrexed disodium, 500 mg/m2 in 100 mL of
normal saline was infused intravenously over 10 minutes
via an automatic dispensing pump followed by carboplatin, area under the concentration curve (AUC) 5 (AUC ¼
5) which was administered in 250 mL of 0.9% saline or
5% dextrose intravenously over 30 minutes. The dose of
carboplatin (AUC ¼ 5) was chosen because of its use in
prior studies with a similar patient population.18,21 Cycles
were repeated every 21 days for a maximum of 6 cycles.
Response Assessment and Toxicity
Tumor assessments were performed every 6 weeks with
radiographic imaging using computer tomography (CT)
scan, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or chest x-ray.
Disease response was determined according to the
RECIST criteria.22 The cytological confirmation of the
neoplastic origin of any effusion that appeared or worsened during treatment when the measurable tumor had
met criteria for response or stable disease was mandatory
to differentiate between response or stable disease (an effusion may be a side effect of the treatment) and progressive
disease. Toxicity was graded according to the National
Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (CTCAE)
v.3.0 grading system and was defined as any adverse event
that was possibly, probably, or definitely related to the
study treatment.
Statistical Methods
The primary endpoint for this trial was the confirmed
response rate, calculated as the number of evaluable
patients with a confirmed response (ie, a partial response,
[PR] or complete response, [CR] that held for at least 4
weeks), divided by the total number of evaluable patients.
For patients younger than the age of 70, a 1-stage design
was used to test whether there was sufficient evidence to

2384

determine that the confirmed response rate was at least
60% (ie, clinically promising) versus at most 40% (ie,
clinically inactive). This study had 94% power to detect a
confirmed response rate of 60%, with a 0.11 level of significance. For this age cohort, we planned to accrue a total
of 46 evaluable patients. If at least 23 of all 46 evaluable
patients had a confirmed response, this would be considered adequate evidence of promising activity and would
warrant further testing of this regimen in subsequent studies. A similar 1-stage design was used for patients aged
70 and older. This study had 79% power to detect a confirmed response rate of 60%, with a 0.11 level of significance. For this age cohort, we planned to accrue a total of
24 evaluable patients. If at least 13 of all 24 evaluable
patients had a confirmed response, this would be considered adequate evidence of promising activity and would
warrant further testing of this regimen in subsequent
studies.
Secondary endpoints included toxicities, duration of
response, time-to-disease progression, and overall survival. These endpoints were analyzed between the age
groups (aged <70 years vs aged 70 years), where the
Fisher exact test was used to compare categorical data (ie,
response, toxicity, gender, etc.) and the Wilcoxon rank
sum test was used to compare continuous data (ie, age).
The commonly occurring grade 3 þ toxicities (ie, adverse
events at least possibly related to the study treatment)
were reported. Kaplan-Meier methodology was used to
describe the distribution of time-to-disease progression,
survival, and duration of response.23 The log-rank test
was used to compare the time-to-disease progression and
overall survival by age cohort. Statistical tests were 2sided, with P < .05 considered statistically significant. Pvalues were not adjusted for multiple comparisons. Statistical analyses were performed using SAS software (SAS
institute, Cary, NC).

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
Between April 5, 2006 and September 14, 2007, 50
patients were enrolled in this study. Two patients
were deemed ineligible (1 had received prior chemotherapy, and the other had a performance status of
3), and 2 other patients canceled before receiving
any treatment, leaving a total of 46 evaluable patients
(from 24 treatment locations) who were included in
this analysis. The patients were analyzed in 2 age
cohorts, <70 years and 70 years, with 29 and 17

patients, respectively. Patient characteristics were similar between the 2 groups (see Table 1) and overall
median age was 66 years. In the younger cohort, median age was 62 years (range, 48-69 years), 59%
were men, 97% had a performance status (PS) of 0
or 1, and 76% had at least 2 metastatic sites at
baseline. In the older cohort, median age was 75
years (range, 70-80 years), 53% were men, 76% had
a PS of 0 or 1, and 82% had at least 2 metastatic
sites at baseline.
Outcome Measures
All 46 patients were evaluable for efficacy outcomes,
which were similar between the 2 age groups (see
Table 2, Figs. 1 and 2). Overall, the confirmed
response rate was 35% (16 of 46; 95% CI, 21-50)
with all partial responses (PR). The median duration
of response was 4.4 months (95% CI, 2.9-5.2). On

the basis of these results, we had strong evidence that
the study would not meet the efficacy criteria and was
closed before full accrual.
We found 6 (21%) patients who were still alive with
a median follow-up of 16.3 months in the younger patient
group. Twenty-six patients had progressed, and 23 had
died. Median time-to-progression and median overall survival were 4.2 months (95% CI, 2.5-4.5) and 9.2 months
(95% CI, 5.4-11.6), respectively. In the older age cohort,
3 (18%) patients were still alive, the median follow-up
was 15.7 months, 15 patients had progressed, and 14 had
died. Median time-to-progression and median survival
was 4.2 months (95% CI, 1.4-6.5) and 10.8 months
(95% CI, 2.2-14.3), respectively. Although information
on subsequent treatment after the patients had failed
front-line therapy were not collected, it is possible that
subsequent therapy may have added to the patients’ survival observed in this trial.

Treatment Information
A median of 4 cycles of therapy (range, 1-6 cycles) was
administered in the study. Most patients (29 of 46; 63%)
discontinued treatment early because of disease progression (19 of 29 [66%] in <70 years age group and 10 of 17
[59%] in the 70 years age group). Of the remaining 17
patients, 9 patients completed the study per protocol, 2
patients stopped early because of adverse events, 2 patients
refused further treatment, 2 patients died while on study
treatment (1 of whom died because of treatment), 1
patient stopped early for financial reasons/insurance
issues, and 1 patient stopped early to receive alternative
treatment. For patients <70 years, >80% of the treated
patients in the first 3 cycles received full-dose pemetrexed
(full dose ¼ 98% of dose per protocol), and this
declined to approximately 60% of the treated patients by
Cycles 5 and 6. At least 90% of the treated patients in
Cycles 1-3 received full-dose carboplatin, and this
decreased to approximately 70% of treated patients for
Cycles 4-6. For the older age cohort, at least 90% of the
treated patients for each cycle received full-dose pemetrexed, and all of the treated patients for each cycle
received full-dose carboplatin.

Figure 2. Illustrated is the overall survival by age cohort.

Toxicities
All 46 eligible patients who received treatment were
also evaluable for toxicity analysis. There were no
significant differences in grades 3 and 4 toxicities
between the 2 age cohorts (see Table 3). Grade 3/4
and grade 4 hematological toxicities were observed in
46% and 26% of patients, respectively. The most
commonly occurring grade 3/4 toxicities (see Table
4) included anemia (13%), neutropenia (43%), and
thrombocytopenia (24%). Other commonly occurring
grade 3/4 nonhematological toxicities included hyperglycemia (7%), fatigue (11%), and anorexia (7%).
One patient (aged 70 years) died during the study
from a grade 5 febrile neutropenia that resulted from
bacteremia. No other grade 5 events occurred.

DISCUSSION
This study showed that in patients with untreated extensive-stage SCLC, first-line chemotherapy with pemetrexed and carboplatin is not superior to the current
recommended first-line treatment of platinum-based
chemotherapy with etoposide. Although the combination
of pemetrexed and carboplatin does show activity in
extensive-stage SCLC as previously reported by Socinski
et al,18 the overall response rate of 35% in our study is the
lowest compared with other studies of first-line therapies
in untreated extensive-stage SCLC (35%-69%).9,11,21 At
1 year, the overall survival rate across all patients was 32%
(95% CI, 21%-49%) which was lower than a previous
study, which reported a 1-year overall survival of 39%.18
Median time-to-progression was 4.2 months and at the
time of analysis, only 11% of patients remained progression-free.
The poor response rate observed in this study may
be due to our study population, which included patients
Cancer

May 15, 2010

who received prior WBRT, prior palliative radiation, and
those who had more than 2 metastatic sites at the time of
enrollment. In extensive-stage SCLC, known adverse
prognostic factors are metastatic involvement of the central nervous system and the number of metastatic sites.4
The previous study using pemetrexed and carboplatin in
untreated extensive-stage SCLC did not identify these
patient characteristics.18 The preliminary results of a
randomized phase 3 study have also confirmed our study
findings, whereby the pemetrexed and carboplatin regimen was shown to be inferior compared with etoposide
and carboplatin, with an overall response rate of 24.9%
and 40.5%, respectively, and an overall survival of 7.3
months and 9.6 months, respectively (hazard ratio, 1.78;
95% CI, 1.29-2.45).24 As no CRs and only PRs were
achieved in our study and the previous study,18 this may
be another reason inferior results are seen with pemetrexed and carboplatin when compared with the current
platinum-based chemotherapy with etoposide. Limited
data have suggested that patients who achieve a CR have a
better long-term survival compared with those who have a
PR or primary treatment failure.25 In vitro studies of
human tumor specimens have shown that low levels of TS
gene expression significantly correlated with chemosensitivity to pemetrexed.26 Similarly, in non-SCLC cell lines,
high pretreatment TS expression levels conferred resistance to pemetrexed.27 As higher TS expression levels have
been found in SCLC compared with carcinoid tumors,
this may account for the marginal activity of pemetrexed
in combination with carboplatin in extensive-stage
SCLC.28,29
The combination of pemetrexed and carboplatin
appeared to be well tolerated as demonstrated by our older
patient group who received 90% of full-dose pemetrexed and 100% of full-dose carboplatin compared with
our younger patient group. Similar findings were also
observed in a previous study.18 Hematological toxicities,
although present, did not cause significant adverse events,
except for 1 patient who died of a grade 5 neutropenic
fever. However, grade 3/4 hematological toxicities
reported in our study were higher compared with the
study by Socinski et al.18
In conclusion, we do not recommend pemetrexed
and carboplatin be used as first-line chemotherapy in
untreated patients with extensive-stage SCLC. Although
this chemotherapy combination shows some activity in
SCLC and is well tolerated, it does not appear to improve
outcome when compared with the current standard of
care. In view of the recently completed trial of single-agent

pemetrexed that showed minimal activity in relapsed
extensive-stage SCLC,30 this regimen should not be considered in the relapsed setting. There is a pressing need to
continue the search for more effective agents in this recalcitrant disease, and, currently, clinical trials with targeted
agents are necessary and ongoing.31

CONFLICT OF INTEREST DISCLOSURES
This study was conducted as a collaborative trial of the North
Central Cancer Treatment Group and Mayo Clinic and was
supported in part by Public Health Service grants CA-25,224,
