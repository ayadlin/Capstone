Abstract
Because the mRNA expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is
up-regulated by arecoline in human gingival fibroblasts, as
shown in our previous study, we further investigated the mRNA
expression level of COX-2 and its upstream effectors in three
oral epithelial carcinoma cell lines (KB, SAS, and Ca9-22) by
using areca nut extract (ANE) and saliva-reacted ANE (sANE). A
case-control study of 377 oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC)
patients and 442 controls was conducted to evaluate the geneenvironment interaction between COX-2 promoter polymorphisms and substance use of alcohol, betel quid, and cigarettes
(ABC) in risk of OSCC. The heterogeneous characteristics of
the oral site and the COX-2 1195G>A polymorphism in these
cell lines showed diverse inflammatory response (KBJCa922>SAS) after 24-hour ANE/sANE treatments, and the COX-2
up-regulation might be mostly elicited from alternative nuclear
factor-KB activation. In the case-control study, betel chewing
[adjusted odds ratios (aOR), 42.2] posed a much higher risk of
OSCC than alcohol drinking and cigarette smoking (aORs, 2.4
and 1.8, respectively), whereas the COX-2 1195A/A homozygote presented a potential genetic risk (OR, 1.55). The strongest
joint effect for OSCC was seen in betel chewers with 1195A/A
homozygote (aOR, 79.44). In the non–betel chewing group, the
1195A/G and A/A genotypes together with the combined use
of alcohol and cigarettes increased risk to 15.1-fold and 32.1fold, respectively, compared with the G/G genotype without
substance use. Taken together, these findings illustrate a
valuable insight into the potential role of the COX-2 promoter
region in contributing to the development of betel-related
OSCC, including ANE/sANE–induced transcriptional effects
and enhanced joint effects of COX-2 1195A allele with
substance use of ABC. [Cancer Res 2008;68(20):8489–98]

per 100,000 men, and particularly occurs in south central Asia (1).
In Taiwan, unfortunately, the ASIR of oral cancer was almost 27 per
100,000 men in 2000, which ranks highly in the world (2). Also, the
standardized death rate of oral cavity cancer increased between
1986 and 2006. According to the 2006 annual report of the
Department of Health, it is the sixth leading cause of all cancer
mortality and the fourth most common cancer in men in Taiwan.
Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) accounts for >90% of oral
cancer and can develop from oral precancerous lesions (OPL),
such as leukoplakia and erythroplakia. In clinical studies, OSCC is
diagnosed as an invasive epithelial neoplasm with various degrees
of squamous differentiation characterized by a histopathologic
grade of keratinization. We have shown the independent and
synergistic effects of alcohol drinking, betel chewing, and cigarette
smoking (ABC) on the risk of OPL in southern Taiwan (3). Most
relevantly, it is well documented that the prevalent habit of betel
chewing is a serious public health concern and an independent
environmental risk in developing oral cancer in Taiwan (4–6).
Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is a prostaglandin synthase that
accounts for inflammation response and xenobiotic metabolism.
The elevated COX-2 expression is well recognized as having a
potential role in contributing to the progress of head and neck
cancer through several biological pathways (7–9). The 5¶-coding
sequence of the COX-2 gene contains an epidermal growth factor
(EGF)–like domain. EGF can induce COX-2 expression through the
EGF receptor signaling pathway (10, 11). Additionally, the COX-2
promoter contains several putative transcription factor elements
(12); thereby, its expression level can be modulated by numerous
growth factors, cytokines, and transcription factor binding sites via
several signaling pathways. The presence of two nuclear factor-nB
(NF-nB) binding sites in the COX-2 promoter is also relevant on
NF-nB activation in proinflammatory and cancerous processes
(13, 14). On the other hand, by negative cross-talks with NF-nB,
the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR), nuclear
retinoic acid receptors (RAR), and retinoid X receptors (RXR) can
reduce irregular COX-2 induction and inhibit carcinogenesis on
various epithelial tissues (15–17). Although we have reported that
arecoline-induced COX-2 from the oral microenvironment may
contribute to the development of OPL or oral cancer (18), the
process of cellular signaling pathways between enhanced COX-2
expression and betel-related OSCC is not yet fully understood. In
this study, we first determined the transcriptional changes of
upstream inflammatory effectors in a dose-response relationship
study with areca nut extract (ANE), including growth factors,

cytokines, mediators, and regulatory elements. The cytotoxic effect
of saliva-reacted ANE (sANE) was also investigated because saliva
catalyzes the ingredients of areca nut (AN) into derived nitrosamines, such as 3-(methylnitrosamino)propionitrile (MNPN) and
N-nitrosoguvacoline (NGL; refs. 19, 20). By this approach, we could
further characterize the upstream regulators significantly involved
in AN-induced COX-2 expression and possibly in risk of betelrelated OSCC.
Betel chewing with tobacco or smokeless tobacco chewing poses
a risk of developing oral cancer, but these are not commonly seen
in Taiwan (6, 21, 22). Alternatively, combined substance use of ABC
is widely observed in the high-risk Taiwanese population and its
synergistic effects have a large role in the etiology of upper
aerodigestive cancers (4, 23–25). Moreover, the gene susceptibility
from individual genetic variants is well known to contribute to
different disease processes and status. This explains why some
subjects exposed to a similar time or dose of ABC did not get the
corresponding oral lesions and cancer. Therefore, the polymorphic
variants in the COX-2 promoter region are the foremost genetic
factors that modify cancer susceptibility by modulating the
expression level of COX-2 in the inflammatory process and
tumorigenesis. Consequently, we hypothesized that the different
risk levels of developing OSCC might result from varied geneenvironment interactions between the COX-2 promoter polymorphisms and the substance use of ABC. This case-control study
investigates the independent and joint effects of COX-2 promoter
variations with or without betel chewing in risk of OSCC.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture and ANEs. Three oral carcinoma cell lines, KB (epidermoid
carcinoma), SAS (tongue carcinoma), and Ca9-22 (gingival carcinoma), were
used in this study. KB cells were maintained in DMEM-11885 with 1
nonessential amino acid; SAS and Ca9-22 were maintained in DMEM/F12.
Each culture medium was supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum,
100 IU/mL penicillin G, 100 Ag/mL streptomycin, and 0.25 Ag/mL
amphotericin B (Invitrogen). AN was purchased from a local commercial
store and homogenized with or without a 20% human saliva–contained
solution. The 20% human saliva–contained ANE was then incubated at
37jC for 8 h before harvesting. The aqueous ANE and sANE were
immediately passed through 6-Am (Advantec) and 0.22-Am (Millipore)
filters and stored in a freeze-drying form at 20jC until use.
Cell viability. Each cell line was trypsinized and seeded into a 96-well
plate at a density of 104 cells per well in a total volume of 100 AL. Cells were
cultured for 24 h before the addition of the various concentrations (0, 100,
200, 400, and 800 Ag/mL) of ANE and sANE. To assess the cell viability
through dose-response relationships, the living cell activity via mitochondrial dehydrogenase was quantified using In vitro Toxicology Assay kit
(MTS-based, Promega). The absorbance of a dual-wavelength reading
(490/690 nm) was measured by the Benchmark Plus Microplate Spectrophotometer (Bio-Rad), and the quantification of average cell viability (%)
was performed in triplicate at each treatment. The alteration of cellular
morphology was visualized on a 100 magnification level using an inverted
microscope (Leica Microsystems).
Real-time quantitative reverse transcription-PCR. After 24-h treatments with ANE/sANE, total RNA was isolated using RNeasy Midi kits with
DNase digestion (Qiagen). Total RNA (2 Ag) was used to synthesize firststrand cDNA with oligo dT primers using a SuperScript III first-strand
synthesis kit (Invitrogen). The cytotoxic effects on COX-2 mRNA expression
of various ANE/sANE treatments (0, 100, 200, 400, and 800 Ag/mL) were first
determined. Furthermore, 23 selected genes related to proinflammatory
signaling were conducted and divided into four signaling groups: (a) growth
factors (EGF, TGFB1 , and GDF15 ); (b) cytokines/mediators (TNFA,
TNFRSF11A, MAP4K4, IL1B, IL6, and IL8); (c) NF-nB signaling (MAP3K14/

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (20). October 15, 2008

NIK, AKT1, RELA, RELB, REL, NFKB1, and NFKB2); and (d) PPARs (PPARA
and PPARG), retinoid receptors (RARA and RARB; RXRA and RXRB), and
cAMP-responsive element binding protein binding protein (CREBBP). The
primer sets for the Universal ProbeLibrary Set (human) assay were listed in
Supplementary Table S1, and real-time quantitative reverse transcriptionPCR was performed using the LightCycler 1.2 and 480 System (Roche), as
previously described (18). The gene expression level was normalized using
b-actin (ACTB) as an internal reference gene, and the average relative
change was calculated from triplicate to quintuplicate determinations by
relative quantification, applying the formula 2DDCt. Compared with
control, the arbitrary cutoff of >2-fold average change was defined as
significantly up-regulated. The strength of fold change was arbitrarily
described as minor (2-fold to 5-fold), moderate (5-fold to 10-fold), and
strong (>10-fold) up-regulation.
Study population and specimen collection. A total of 377 male
patients diagnosed with OSCC were recruited from the Department of
Dentistry and the Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Kaohsiung Medical
University Hospital. The control group, composed of 442 unrelated males,
was frequency-matched with OSCCs by age. This study was approved by the
Human Experiment and Ethics Committee of Kaohsiung Medical University
(KMU-IRB-950070 and KMU-IRB-950072). The questionnaire data, medical
report, whole blood sample, and oral tissue specimens were gathered from
volunteers after written informed consents were obtained. The demographic characteristics with regard to personal information, substance use
history, and disease status were included in the analysis. An individual
without substance use of alcohol, betel quid, and cigarettes was defined as
nondrinker, nonchewer, and nonsmoker, respectively. To evaluate the doseresponse relationship of ABC in the risk of OSCC, the variable of
consumption years was stratified into two subgroups (nonusers and users)
and three subgroups (nonusers, V20 y, and >20 y) in alcohol drinking and
cigarette smoking and four subgroups (nonchewers, V10 y, 11–20 y, and
>20 y) in betel chewing. The starting age of substance use was divided into
three subgroups (nonusers, V20 y, and >20 y). For gene expression analysis,
pairs of tumor and normal marginal tissues were obtained from nine
OSCCs. The tumor grade of oral cancerous tissue was diagnosed by a
histopathologist. Frozen tissues were soaked in RNAlater-ICE (Ambion) at
20jC before total RNA isolation. Total RNA was extracted with TRIzol
reagent (Invitrogen) and RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) according to the
instruction manual. The method of cDNA synthesis and real-time
quantitative PCR was as described previously.
Resequencing of COX-2 promoter region and genotyping. Briefly,
genomic DNA of cell lines and human whole blood were isolated using
Puregene DNA purification kit (Gentra). In resequencing, two amplicons
expanded from position +56 of exon 1 to 1541 of the 5¶ untranslated region
in the COX-2 promoter region (972 bp, forward 5¶-catttagcgtccctgcaaat-3¶
and reverse 5¶-ctgctgaggagttcctggac-3¶; 977 bp, forward 5¶-tccgtgtctcatgaagaatca-3¶ and reverse 5¶-tgacgacgcttaataggctgta-3¶) were resequenced in
20 pairs of OSCCs and controls. Genetic variation detection and minor allele
frequency (MAF) were further analyzed. Genotyping was performed by
PCR-based RFLP (PCR-RFLP). PCR products were amplified using 100 ng
DNA, 1.5 mmol/L MgCl2, 0.3 units of Super-Therm Gold DNA polymerase
(JMR Holdings), and 5 Amol/L each of the forward and reverse primers
(765G>C, forward 5¶-ccgcttcctttgtccatcag-3¶ and reverse 5¶-ggctgtatatctgctctatatgc-3¶; 1195G>A, forward 5¶-ccctgagcactacccatgat-3¶ and
reverse 5¶-gcccttcataggagatactgg-3¶) in a 30-AL reaction volume. The PCR
conditions for 765G>C were as follows: an initial denaturation of 94jC for
5 min; 35 cycles of 95jC for 30 s, 62jC for 30 s, and 72jC for 45 s; and a final
extension of 72jC for 7 min. The PCR condition for 1195G>A was identical,
except for the annealing temperature with 45jC in cycling. The genotypes of
765G>C and 1195G>A were distinguished using AciI and PvuII (NEB),
respectively, and visualized by electrophoresis on 3% agarose gels stained
with ethidium bromide under UV light transilluminator (Alpha Innotech).
Statistical analysis. The P values for linear trend on cell viability (%)
and mRNA expression level were analyzed using the t test (slope estimate)
in simple linear regression models. The difference was considered
statistically significant at the P < 0.05 or P < 0.01 level. The average
fold-changes among all treatments (n = 8; doses of 100, 200, 400, and

normally polygonal form, whereas numbers
of enlarged round form and atrophied
form were observed at ANE-treated and
sANE-treated cells, especially on
KB cells.

800 Ag/mL of both extracts) were used to assess the level of gene
coexpressions between upstream effectors and COX-2 by the Pearson’s and
Spearman’s correlation coefficients. In the case-control study, the trend for
dose effect on substance use of ABC was calculated by using the CochranArmitage trend test. In the genotype analysis, the goodness-of-fit m2 test
was used to evaluate any deviation from the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium
in OSCCs and controls, respectively. Adjusted odds ratios (aOR), 95%
confidence intervals (95% CI), exact P values of independent and joint
effects, and P values for interaction based on a multiplicative interaction
model were estimated by a multiple logistic regression model controlling
potential confounders. The aORs were adjusted for continuous age and
substance use of ABC (yes and no). All analyses were performed using the
SAS Statistical Package (version 9.1.3, SAS Institute, Inc.).

Results
Cell viability and morphologic change. After a series of ANE/
sANE treatments for 24 hours, sANE decreased cell viability in a
dose-dependent manner (P trend < 0.05 or P trend < 0.01) in all cell
lines, whereas ANE significantly decreased the viability of KB and

Ca9-22 cells (Fig. 1A). The cytotoxic effect of both extracts causes
the normal attached cells to change to enlarged round and
atrophied forms, especially at the concentration of 800 Ag/mL
(Fig. 1B ). In morphologic changes on the concentration of
800 Ag/mL of both sANE and ANE, the KB cells were observed to
have a higher cellular damage than Ca9-22 and SAS. Although
Ca9-22 and SAS were seen to have a higher toxic tolerance for
ANE/sANE treatments, the inhibition of cell growth and spreading
by both extracts seems to influence the cellular viability.
Discovery of COX-2 promoter polymorphisms. The valid
resequencing in the COX-2 proximal promoter region in the three
cell lines and 20 pairs of subjects was expanded from position 1
to 1463. The RFLP-based COX-2 1195G>A genotype of KB,
SAS, and Ca9-22 showed A/A, A/G, and G/G, respectively; other
positions of genetic variation using resequencing were identical in
the COX-2 promoter region (Fig. 2A and B). In the case-control
study, the positions of 285A>C, 765G>C, 1195G>A, and
1290A>G were discovered by MAFs with 50% (A/C, 50:50), 5.1%

mRNA expression levels with ANE and sANE treaments. We

greater response, in a dose-dependent manner, of various
inflammatory genes than Ca9-22 (G/G) and SAS (A/G) after a

concentrations of 400 to 800 Ag/mL on KB cells, whereas the two
latter genes showed extremely strong up-regulation. Nevertheless,
all of these presented no significance to minor up-regulation on
SAS and Ca9-22. In addition to two other genes involved in the
TNFa signaling pathway, MAP4K4 and TNFRSF11A only showed a
minor up-regulation on KB cells. In upstream regulators of NF-nB
signaling pathway, MAP3K14 and AKT1 showed no significant upregulation on all treatments in these OSCC lines. Remarkably, in
the NF-nB family members, the ANE/sANE–treated mRNA
expression level of RELB and NFKB2 displayed higher up-regulation
than RELA and NFKB1 on KB and Ca9-22.
Compared with untreated control, the mRNA expression level of
group d showed no significant change on these cell lines in spite of
positively increased trends on most genes in sANE treatments
(Supplementary Fig. S2). Unexpectedly, the crossing point values of
RARB and TNFA were undetermined in low abundant cDNA of
all Ca9-22 samples, whereas RARB was undetermined on the
800 Ag/mL–treated KB samples. With regard to parallel coexpression with COX-2 on KB cells, the up-regulated level of 17
upstream effector genes was significantly associated with the
increased level of COX-2 in accordance with the Spearman’s rank
correlation coefficients and P values, but not EGF, REL, RXRA,
RARA, RARB, and CREBBP (Supplementary Table S2).
Characterization of study population. The selected characteristics of age, ethnicity, and substance use were summarized in
Table 1. No statistically significant differences were observed
between OSCCs and controls in terms of age and ethnicity
distribution. The adjusted estimates of substance use of ABC were
2.4-fold, 42.2-fold, and 1.8-fold at risk of OSCC on the study group,
respectively. The results, as expected, indicated betel chewing as
the strongest risk factor accounting for OSCC in Taiwan. In
addition, the dose-response relationship showed a positively

increased risk in consumption years of substance use of ABC
(all P trend < 0.0001). Compared with nonusers, the study subjects
with late starting age (>20 years) among all substance use
represented a higher risk than those with early starting age
(V20 years). In the study group of non–betel chewers, at controlling
age, the independent risk of cigarette smoking (aOR, 1.82; 95% CI,
0.90–3.67) had similar OSCC risk with the betel chewing group;
however, the risk was almost twice in the alcohol drinking group
(aOR, 4.41; 95% CI, 2.21–8.79). Compared with nonusers, the
subjects who had a combined use of both substance increased risk
to 8.70-fold (95% CI, 3.30–22.94; table not shown).
Independent and joint effects of genetic variants and
substance use. Compared with the wild type, the A/A homozygote
of COX-2 1195G>A was significantly associated with OSCC
(A/A versus G/G; OR, 1.85; 95% CI, 1.05-3.28; data not shown) in
the pilot study, whereas the 765G>C variant showed no
statistically significant difference (Table 2). In expanding analysis,
177 of OSCCs were recruited from a previous study (26); however,
these were only genotyped for 1195G>A in this study. In the
genetically polymorphic distribution of 1195G>A, there was no
deviation from the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in both OSCCs and
controls (Table 2). A significant difference was observed in the
allele frequencies of 1195G>A between OSCCs and controls
(P = 0.036), and allele A appeared to be in risk of OSCCs (OR, 1.23).
Compared with subjects holding the G/G homozygote, those with
the A/A homozygote had a 1.55-fold increased risk of OSCC but
those with the A/G heterozygote displayed no statistically
significant risk (OR, 1.13; 95% CI, 0.80–1.60). In OSCCs, we
observed no statistical difference in the consumption years and
the starting age of substance use of ABC among the three
genotypes of 1195G>A by ANOVA (data not shown).
Controlling for the effects of alcohol drinking and cigarette
smoking, non–betel chewers with the A allele had a 1.75-fold

increased OSCC risk compared with those with the G allele, and the
risk was found to be enhanced to 60.18-fold among betel chewers
(Table 3). A similar risk-enhanced pattern with regard to the COX-2
A/A genotype was identified among betel chewers, with the highest
risk (aOR, 79.44) observed in COX-2 A/A chewers. Although this
joint risk was greater than the expected combined risk estimated
from an additive interaction model {synergy index = (79.44  1)/
[(59.87  1) + (3.05  1)] = 1.29}, as shown in the stratified aOR,
the multiplicative interaction between COX-2 1195G>A and betel
chewing was not significant (P = 0.441). Among the non–betel
chewers (OSCCs/controls, 41:372), the significant joint risk of
contracting OSCC (aOR, 15.09) for alcohol drinking and cigarette
smoking was found among subjects who carried the COX-2 A/G
heterozygote, and a higher risk (aOR, 32.13) was recognized among
subjects who carried the A/A homozygote. Although the stratified
aOR for the combined use of the two substances increased with the
increase in number of the A allele, no significant interaction in the

mRNA gene expression of selected genes on OSCCs. In
consideration of the influential factors related to tissue mRNA
expression level, the personal information on tumor site, tumor
stage (based on tumor-node metastasis grade), and substance use
of ABC and COX-2 1195G>A was exhibited according to the
interview data, medical record, and genotyping (Fig. 3A). Seven
patients showed a significant up-regulation (>2-fold) in COX-2
mRNA expression, ranging from 2.51-fold to 7.82-fold, except for
O132 (1.52-fold) and O086 (1.24-fold). With regard to NF-nB
signaling elements, the significant up-regulation of RELB and
NFKB2, which had higher expression levels than RELA and NFKB1,
was observed in six OSCCs (C089, C099, CA056, O130, O136, and
KO012), but two of them (O130 and KO012) did not have the habit
of betel chewing. Remarkably, O130 patient was noted as a heavy

betel-related buccal OSCCs showed a higher fold change of COX-2
expression level (4.36 F 3.21-fold) than betel-related tongue
OSCCs (1.87 F 0.85-fold; Fig. 3B). The COX-2 expression level of
betel-related OSCCs had a positive increase in cancer stage, except
for stage I. However, the sample size was insufficient to provide a
powerful evidence in clarifying the association between COX-2
1195G>A variants and inflammatory level of betel-related OSCC
in each cancer stage.

Discussion
Betel chewing with or without tobacco has been a well-declared
carcinogenic for human oral cavity (6, 27). Accordingly, in 2004, AN
is declared to be carcinogenic to humans (group 1) based on an
indirect evaluation from sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity of
betel quid. In addition, the AN-derived nitrosamines, including
NGL and MNPN, can be detected in the saliva of betel chewers
without tobacco (19, 28). In our findings, the higher cytotoxic

analyzed, including four betel-related
buccal OSCCs, three betel-related tongue
OSCCs, and two tongue OSCCs without

marginal tissue, the relative fold-change
was calculated in triplicate (columns,
mean; bars, SD) by using the formula

presented in individuals with important
influential factors, including personal
substance use of ABC and genotype of
COX-2 1195G>A. B, the average mRNA
expression level of all OSCCs was shown
at two conditions: tumor site (buccal and
tongue) and cancer stage (I–IV). The fully
betel-related OSCCs on two conditions
were also displayed in extra columns.

The Potential Role of COX-2 Promoter in Risk of OSCC

effects at cell morphologic changes and mRNA expression level
were observed in sANE treatments. However, whether the
ingredients of sANE contain any AN-derived nitrosamine requires
further analysis.
The biological function of COX-2 is notable not only for
recalling the inflammation response but also for involvement in
cooxidation during xenobiotic biotransformation (29). The arecoline-induced COX-2 up-regulation on human gingival fibroblasts
has been characterized in our previous study (18), and the higher
increased trend of COX-2 induction on KB cells by ANE/sANE
treatments was found in the present study. COX-2 up-regulation in
betel-related OSCC can be enhanced via a variety of upstream
effectors, which are released from oral epithelial cells or
microenvironment under betel quid/AN exposure by binding to
their recognition sequences in the COX-2 coding region or
promoter. Consequently, we selected 23 candidate genes to
characterize the potential regulators in ANE/sANE–induced
COX-2 signaling by using a dose-response analysis in mRNA
expression change.
Despite EGF having a critical role in enhanced COX-2 expression,
the mRNA expression of EGF was not significantly induced by
ANE/sANE in OSCC lines. With regard to the proinflammatory
regulators, the AN-induced TNFA, IL6, IL1B, and IL8 had a
significant parallel effect with COX-2 up-regulation on KB cells.
The findings are also responding to the important roles of TNFA,
IL6, and PGE2 in ANE-induced keratinocyte inflammation (30) and
the detectable up-regulation of IL1B and IL8 in OSCCs by a salivary
transcriptome analysis (5.48-fold and 24.3-fold, respectively;
ref. 31). Within the oral microenvironment, we suggested that
ANE/sANE–induced IL1B from the oral mucosa may enhance more
COX-2 induction in the gingival region via Ca2+ mobilization in a
long-term betel quid (contained slaked lime) chewing, as described
previously (18).
In TGF-h signaling, the mRNA expression of GDF15 is strongly
induced by arecoline on human gingival fibroblasts in our previous
study (18). The similar effect was also found on KB cells by
24-hour ANE/sANE treatments, whereas minor up-regulation was
seen on SAS and Ca9-22. Interestingly, it has been shown that the
GDF15 promoter region contains two p53 response elements and
plays a role in signaling cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (32).
Recently, its transcriptional activation shows involvement in the
regulation of transactivating p63-mediated keratinocyte differentiation (33). Although the functional role of the unprocessed form
of GDF15 in tumorigenesis remains unknown, the overexpression
of GDF15 might associate with abnormal keratinocyte differentiation toward keratinization, which we can observe in the
keratinizing OSCC.
NF-nB is suggested to involve in tumorigenesis (14), and a
parallel effect between NF-nB and COX-2 protein expression has
been reported in smokeless tobacco-related OPL and oral cancer
(9). Dependent on the induction of proinflammatory regulators and
the activation of InB kinase complex, NF-nB signaling pathways are
divided into classic [RELA-p50 (NFKB1)] and alternative [RELB-p52
(NFKB2); ref. 34]. We thought that both NF-nB signaling pathways
may coexist in the betel-induced NF-nB activation on oral epithelial
cells, although the higher mRNA expression of RELB and NFKB2
may imply that the alternative pathway plays an important role in
most COX-2 up-regulation. Furthermore, we attempted to validate
the mRNA expression level of COX-2 and NF-nB signaling elements
in OSCC patients. Although it indicated that COX-2 is up-regulated
in malignant tissues, the accumulative dosage and combination of

www.aacrjournals.org

substance use and tumor histologic grade lead to much more
complexity on elucidation of COX-2 1195 variants into the role of
inflammatory mechanisms. This needs to be clarified by a big
enough sample size in further studies, and it is important to prove
whether COX-2 1195A/A has a functional role in contributing to
higher inflammatory levels on OSCCs.
In negative cross-talks with NF-nB, PPARg can inhibit
inflammatory transcriptional responses mediated by activator
protein 1 (AP-1) and NF-nB transcriptional factors (35). Furthermore, it can also repress the phorbol ester–mediated COX-2
transcriptional activation by inhibiting the activity of AP-1 to the
cAMP-responsive element–binding site of the COX-2 promoter
(15). Therefore, it is also important to explore whether ANE/sANE
enhances the COX-2 expression level by down-regulating cellular
PPARs in the meantime. The mRNA expression levels of PPARA,
PPARG, and CREBBP were induced in a dose-dependent manner
on KB and SAS cells by sANE, but none of them were significantly
up-regulated. Nevertheless, further investigation is needed to
determine whether they are significantly up-regulated or downregulated in betel-related OPLs or OSCCs. Moreover, compared
with normal tissues, RARa immunopositivity has shown a
significant increase in OSCCs with substance use of ABC, whereas
it shows a significant decrease in RARh immunopositivity (36–38).
Although no significant up-regulation of RARa and downregulation of RARb are observed in this study, the resembled
effects linking to the findings of both immunoreactivities in OSCCs
are particularly noteworthy.
The cytotoxicity of betel chewing is shown on the basis of
in vitro findings of significant up-regulation in COX-2 and
numerous upstream effectors in oral epithelial cells by ANE/sANE;
however, some betel chewers do not develop OSCC even after
having a long-term or high-frequency usage of betel nut. Therefore,
we hypothesized that individual polymorphic variants in the COX-2
promoter region may contribute to gene susceptibility in the
development of OSCC. In addition, gene-environment interactions
between the COX-2 promoter polymorphisms and the substance
use of ABC are also required in risk assessment to OSCC. The
findings indicated that the COX-2 1195A allele was positively
associated with the risk of OSCC. The 1195 A/A homozygote
presents a stronger risk of OSCC than A/G and G/G genotypes,
especially when joined with the habit of betel chewing. Based on
both in vitro experiments and population association study, the
COX-2 1195 A/A variant seems to increase susceptibility to betelrelated OSCC. Furthermore, in betel nonchewers, the strongest
joint effect is also seen in A/A homozygote carriers who have a
combined use of alcohol drinking and cigarette smoking.
Intriguingly, the 1195A allele has been shown to increase a
potential risk of developing esophageal squamous cell carcinoma in
a Chinese Han population (39). Additionally, compared with the
1195G allele, the 1195A allele reveals a higher promoter activity
and COX-2 mRNA expression.
Thus far, several studies illustrate that the risk of OPL or oral
cancer is definitely increased in accordance with the length or dose
of substance use of ABC (3, 40), as well as the findings in this study.
However, the molecular mechanism of OSCC occurrence is more
complex in clinical verification with regard to more confounders
and unexpected conditions. Although this study cannot faithfully
reflect the exact cytotoxicity of oral cavity in betel chewers under
long-term, low-dose exposure, the findings provide an important
insight into the critical role of COX-2 promoter at risk of betelrelated OSCC. Here, we suggest that this study could offer a basic
