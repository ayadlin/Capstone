BACKGROUND: In a previous phase 2 trial, axitinib was active and well tolerated in patients with advanced thyroid cancer. In this second phase 2 trial, the efficacy and safety of axitinib were evaluated further in this population, and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationships and patient-reported outcomes were assessed. METHODS: Patients (N 5 52) with metastatic or unresectable,
locally advanced medullary or differentiated thyroid cancer that was refractory or not amenable to iodine-131 received a starting dose
of axitinib 5 mg twice daily. The primary endpoint was the objective response rate (ORR). Secondary endpoints included progressionfree survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), safety, pharmacokinetic parameters, and patient-reported outcomes assessed with the MD
Anderson Symptom Inventory questionnaire. RESULTS: The overall ORR was 35% (18 partial responses), and 18 patients had stable
disease for 16 weeks. The median PFS was 16.1 months, and the median OS was 27.2 months. All-causality, grade 3 adverse events
(>5%) were fatigue, dyspnea, diarrhea, decreased weight, pain in extremity, hypertension, decreased appetite, palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia, hypocalcemia, and myalgia. Patients who had greater axitinib exposure had a longer median PFS. Quality of life was
maintained during treatment with axitinib, and no significant deterioration in symptoms or interference in daily life caused by symptoms, assessed on MD Anderson Symptom Inventory subscales, were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Axitinib has activity and a manageable safety profile while maintaining quality of life, and it represents an additional treatment option for patients with advanced thyroid

INTRODUCTION
Thyroid cancer incidence has increased in most populations worldwide.1 In 2008, thyroid cancer of any histology was
diagnosed in approximately 212,000 individuals and was responsible for approximately 35,000 deaths worldwide.2 The
5-year survival rate varies by histology3 and stage,4 and the 10-year overall survival (OS) rate is 10% in patients with metastatic, iodine-131 (131I)-refractory, differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC).5
Because thyroid tumors have higher levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) compared with normal thyroid tissue, the VEGF pathway is a potential therapeutic target.6 Several VEGF-receptor (VEGFR) inhibitors7-20 have
been evaluated clinically in metastatic thyroid cancer. International thyroid cancer experts convened in September 2010
and agreed that, when considering VEGFR inhibitors for 131I-refractory DTC, their impact on quality of life (QoL)
should be considered along with their potential for prolonging progression-free survival (PFS) or OS.21 To date, however,
little research has investigated the impact of VEGFR inhibitors on QoL in patients with thyroid cancer.22

Axitinib in Thyroid Cancer: PK/PD & QoL/Locati et al

Axitinib, a potent, selective, second-generation inhibitor of VEGFRs,23 is approved in the United States,24
the European Union, and elsewhere for treatment of
advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) after failure of prior
systemic therapy. In a completed phase 2 trial, axitinib
demonstrated activity and was well tolerated in patients
(N 5 60) with various histologic subtypes of advanced
thyroid cancer for whom 131I failed to control the disease
or was inappropriate therapy.11 In the current phase 2
trial, we further evaluated the efficacy and safety of axitinib in patients with advanced thyroid cancer and assessed
pharmacokinetic (PK)/pharmacodynamic relationships
and patient-reported outcomes (PROs).

uptake (documented by radioiodine scan). Inclusion criteria also were expanded to include medullary or anaplastic
histology.
Other key eligibility criteria included age 18 years,
1 RECIST-defined target lesion, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1,
adequate hepatic and renal function, and a baseline blood
pressure (BP) 140/90 mm Hg. Hypertension controlled
by antihypertensive medications was allowed. Exclusion
criteria included prior antiangiogenic agents, hemoptysis
in the week before enrollment, inability to take oral medications or malabsorption syndromes, use of strong cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors/inducers, active seizure
disorder, or brain metastases.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Design

Study Treatments

In this multicenter, open-label, single-arm, phase 2 study,
a starting dose of axitinib 5 mg twice daily was evaluated
in patients with 131I-refractory (with or without
doxorubicin-refractory disease) or 131I-inappropriate, metastatic or unresectable, locally advanced thyroid cancer.
The primary objective was to determine the investigatorassessed objective response rate (ORR) according to version 1.0 of Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
(RECIST v.1.0).25 Secondary objectives were to determine PFS, duration of response, OS, and safety; to perform population PK analyses; and to evaluate PROs.
This study was conducted in accordance with the
Declaration of Helsinki, the International Conference on
Harmonization Guidelines on Good Clinical Practice,
the study protocol, and applicable local regulatory
requirements and laws. All participants provided written
informed consent and agreed to comply with the study
protocol. Study protocol and informed consent forms
were approved by institutional review boards/independent ethics committees. The trial is registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT00389441).

Axitinib 5 mg twice daily (starting dose) was administered
orally with food. Patients without grade >2 axitinibrelated adverse events (AEs) according to version 3.0 of
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events
(CTCAE v3.0)26 for consecutive 2-week periods could
have axitinib increased to 7 mg twice daily and then to 10
mg twice daily unless they were receiving antihypertensive
medications or their BP was >150/90 mm Hg. In patients
who experienced grade 3 AEs, axitinib was interrupted
and/or reduced to 3 mg twice daily and then, if necessary,
to 2 mg twice daily. Axitinib was continued until patients
developed disease progression or unacceptable toxicity or
withdrew consent. Subsequent therapy was at the investigator’s discretion.

Patients

Original eligibility criteria required histologically documented, metastatic or unresectable locally advanced, 131Irefractory (failure of prior 131I treatment as assessed by the
investigator) DTC (papillary, follicular, or H€
urthle cell
carcinoma) and anthracycline intolerance, contraindication, or refractoriness (RECIST-defined disease progression based on 2 sets of scans during therapy or within 6
months after the last dose). Because of slow accrual, the
protocol was amended to also include DTC that was only
131
I-refractory (RECIST-defined disease progression
within 12 months of enrollment) or that lacked iodine

Assessments

Patients were evaluated with physical examinations and
laboratory tests at screening, predose (day 1, if >7 days
since screening), every 4 weeks on treatment, and 28 days
after the last axitinib dose. Radiologic tumor assessments
were performed at screening (within 28 days of the first
dose), every 8 weeks, at suspected disease progression, and
28 days after the last axitinib dose. RECIST-defined25
response required confirmation 4 weeks after first
documentation.
Safety was monitored throughout the study and
until 28 days after the last axitinib dose; AEs were
graded according to CTCAE v3.0.26 Blood pressure was
measured at each clinic visit and at home twice daily by
patients before each axitinib dose. Patients were to contact
their physicians for a BP >150/100 mm Hg or for BPrelated symptoms (eg, headache, visual disturbance).
The MD Anderson Symptom Inventory (MDASI)
questionnaire was used to assess PROs on day 1 (predose),

every 2 weeks during the first 8 weeks, every 4 weeks
thereafter during treatment, and 28 days after the last axitinib dose. The MDASI, a validated, 19-item questionnaire, consists of 2 subscales assessing 1) the severity of 13
symptoms (pain, fatigue, nausea, disturbed sleep, distress,
shortness of breath, difficulty remembering, lack of appetite, drowsiness, dry mouth, sadness, vomiting, and
numbness/tingling) and 2) symptom interference in 6
areas of function (general activity, walking, work, mood,
relations with people, enjoyment of life).27 Each item on
the MDASI is rated from 0 to 10, and lower scores indicate less symptom severity or interference. The minimum
important difference, defined as the smallest difference in
score considered clinically important, ranges from 0.98 to
1.21.
Plasma Pharmacokinetic Samples and Analysis

Population PK blood samples (7 mL) were collected 15
minutes before and 1 to 2 hours after the morning axitinib
dose (day 1 and every 8 weeks). Axitinib plasma concentrations were measured using a validated, highperformance liquid chromatography, tandem massspectrometry detection method (Charles River Laboratories, Montreal, Quebec, Canada).
After population PK analysis, the individual posthoc area under the plasma concentration-time
curve at steady state (AUCss) was calculated as follows:
AUCss-study 5 average total daily dose during entire time on
study/CL, where CL is the systemic plasma clearance (individual post-hoc clearance estimated from population PK
analysis), and AUCss-study is the average AUCss across the
entire time on study.
Statistical Analysis

Patients who received 1 axitinib dose were included in
the intent-to-treat population for analyses of efficacy,
safety, and PROs. The primary endpoint was
investigator-assessed ORR. Assuming a true ORR 20%
with axitinib, a study of 50 patients had 90% power to
exclude an ORR 5% (with an overall 2-sided significance level of .05; exact binomial test). The 2-sided 95%
exact confidence interval (CI) was provided for the ORR.
Kaplan-Meier methods were used to estimate secondary
endpoints (duration of response, PFS, and OS) and for
post-hoc analyses of the time to response, and median
event times and 2-sided 95% CIs were calculated. Subgroup analyses by histology were performed for ORR,
PFS, and OS. Response was further evaluated according
to the baseline site of metastasis, and PFS was further evaluated according to the AUCss using medians and quartiles

For entire cohort and histologic subtypes, only 1 or 2 post-baseline scans were available, and for sites of metastasis, indeterminate and/or missing.

These were patients who had 1 target lesion according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors and 1 post-baseline assessment. Bone as nontarget lesions were included because of clinical interest.

The axitinib dose was increased to >5 mg twice daily in
28 patients (54%) and was reduced to <5 mg twice daily
in 33 patients (63%) for 2 consecutive doses at any
time during the study. The median relative dose
intensity (total dose administered/total dose assigned 3
100) was 97% (range, 18%-188%). Axitinib was interrupted (ie, both doses were missed for 1 day) in 39
patients (75%). Among the 52 treated patients, the median duration of axitinib interruption was 8 days (range,
0-146 days).
All patients discontinued the study. The 2 most
common reasons for discontinuing were objective progression/relapse (n 5 26; 50%) and axitinib-related AEs
(neuropathy, dyspnea, proteinuria, lower leg ulceration,
myocardial infarction, or cerebral ischemia/respiratory

study ended.

time to objective response was 2.3 months (95% CI, 1.73.7 months), and the median duration of response was
17.2 months (95% CI, 13.6-25.8 months).
The estimated median follow-up as of the cutoff
date (November 9, 2012) was 47.2 months (95% CI,
45.5-48.5 months). In total, 32 patients (62%) experienced disease progression or died while on study (28
days after the last dose). In 6 patients who died while on
study, causes of death were disease progression (n 5 2)
and laryngeal obstruction, dyspnea, hematemesis, and hypertensive heart disease/arteriosclerosis (n 5 1 each).
Another 27 patients died during follow-up either from
disease under study (n 5 24) or for unknown reasons
(n 5 3). The 1-year OS probability was 68% (95% CI,
53%-79%). Investigator-assessed median PFS and OS
were similar for all patients compared with the patients
with DTC (Fig. 2a). According to the post-hoc, 8-week
landmark analysis, patients with diastolic BP 90 mm
Hg versus <90 mm Hg had longer median PFS and OS
(Fig. 2b).

Clinical Activity

The investigator-assessed overall ORR was 35% (95% CI,

symptom-severity and symptom-interference subscales
generally were <1 during cycles 1 through 24 (Fig. 5c),
except for the symptom-severity subscale at cycle 24
(mean change from baseline, 1.05). In general, patients
who continued to receive axitinib and completed MDASI
questionnaires did not experience significant deterioration
in symptoms or interference in daily life because of
symptoms.
DISCUSSION
This phase 2 trial of axitinib in patients with advanced
thyroid cancer confirms the results from a prior phase 2
trial (data on file; Pfizer Inc, New York, NY).11 Although
cross-trial comparisons should be interpreted cautiously,
the ORR (35% and 38%), the median PFS (16.1 months
2700

and 15 months), and median OS (27.2 months and 35
months) were comparable in this and the prior trial,
respectively. It is possible that the inclusion of patients
with different histologic subtypes of thyroid cancer may
confuse the data; however, the comparable median PFS
and OS observed in all patients versus those with DTC
suggest that separating patients according to histologic
subtype would not have produced a substantial change in
the efficacy results.
A post-hoc landmark analysis demonstrated that
patients who developed diastolic BP 90 mm Hg during
axitinib treatment had longer median PFS and OS compared with those who had diastolic BP <90 mm Hg. Prior
retrospective analyses also have evaluated the relationship
between BP increases and efficacy outcomes in patients
with metastatic RCC28,29 or solid tumors,30 including

thyroid cancer, who received axitinib. By using pooled
data from phase 2 studies of axitinib in previously treated
patients with metastatic RCC, logistic regression analyses
demonstrated a positive relationship between higher diastolic BP and the probability of an objective response,
whereas multivariate Cox regression analyses indicated
that an increase in diastolic BP was independently associated with PFS and OS.28 In contrast, post-hoc 8-week
and 12-week landmark analyses from the phase 3 AXIS
trial31 of axitinib versus sorafenib in previously treated
patients with metastatic RCC revealed longer median OS
but similar PFS in axitinib-treated patients who developed
diastolic BP 90 mm Hg compared with those who had
diastolic BP <90 mm Hg.29 Likewise, a Cox proportional
hazards model analysis indicated significantly longer OS
in axitinib-treated patients with different tumor types
who had diastolic BP 90 mm Hg versus <90 mm Hg;
although a similar trend was observed for PFS, it did not
reach statistical significance.30 Results from the current
and prior studies indicate that increases in diastolic BP
may predict positive clinical outcomes in patients with
thyroid cancer in addition to those with metastatic RCC.
Axitinib 24-hour plasma exposures obtained in this
study (median AUCss-study, 316 ng  h/mL) were similar to
those observed in patients with metastatic RCC
(322 ng  h/mL; data on file; Pfizer Inc). In the current
trial, the median PFS was considerably longer in patients
who had axitinib exposure greater than or equal to the median AUCss-study, suggesting a drug exposure-response
relationship in this population. These results suggest that
axitinib dose titration is warranted in patients who tolerate the starting dose of 5 mg twice daily without elevated
BP, as stated in the US-approved label.24 Because axitinib
dose titration was based on individual tolerability, it is
possible that axitinib dose increases and prolonged PFS
were independent outcomes in patients with generally
better health status, and this may have confounded the
observed exposure-response relationship. Nevertheless,
the results reported here are consistent with an updated
analysis from the previous thyroid cancer study, in which
greater tumor size reduction was observed with increasing
axitinib AUCss-study (data on file; Pfizer Inc), as well as a
retrospective analysis that used pooled data from phase 2
studies of axitinib in patients with metastatic RCC, in
which higher drug exposure was associated with prolonged PFS and OS.28
Based on randomized, placebo-controlled trials,
vandetanib20 and cabozantinib12 are approved for metastatic medullary thyroid cancer, and sorafenib32 is
approved for DTC. In patients with progressive, 131I-reCancer

fractory, advanced DTC, a phase 3 trial (DECISION)
demonstrated an independent, radiology review-assessed
median PFS of 10.8 months with sorafenib versus 5.8
months with placebo (hazard ratio, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.450.75; P < .0001); the ORRs (all partial responses) were
12.2% and 0.5% with sorafenib and placebo, respectively
(P < .0001).32 Hence, sorafenib is now considered a new
standard of care for 131I-refractory DTC.
In patients with 131I-refractory, advanced thyroid
cancer, optimal timing for the initiation of VEGFR inhibitors is unknown. Because patients who received placebo
in the DECISION trial could receive open-label sorafenib
upon disease progression,32 those OS results may assist in
determining the best time for treatment initiation. Given
that all VEGFR inhibitors have potential AEs, the ability
to identify the optimal timing for treatment initiation
without sacrificing treatment benefit may be welcome.
Again, it is difficult to compare across trials, especially because AE reporting is not standardized (eg, allcausality vs treatment-related AEs, all-grade vs grade 3
AEs); however, AEs with each VEGFR inhibitor have
some overlap but also vary. Most common all-causality,
all-grade AEs with sorafenib in the DECISION trial were
palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia, diarrhea, alopecia,
rash/desquamation, fatigue, weight loss, and hypertension32; those most common in the current trial with axitinib included diarrhea, hypertension, fatigue, decreased
appetite, decreased weight, extremity pain, nausea, and
dyspnea. These AEs were more common in the first year
of treatment (Fig. 4), and no unexpected late AEs were
observed. During treatment with axitinib, patients did
not report significant deterioration in symptoms or interference in daily life caused by symptoms (assessed by
mean change from baseline MDASI subscales). The latter
suggests that axitinib-related toxicities were well managed
and did not generally compromise drug intake, thus
maintaining high axitinib relative dose intensity (97%),
which correlates with patient outcomes. Inhibitors of
VEGFR are commonly administered as continuous daily
therapy; persistent toxicities, although low grade, may
result in poor compliance with prolonged dose interruptions,33 but this was not observed in the current trial.
Moreover, discontinuation because of axitinib-related
AEs (12%) was comparable to that observed with other
VEFGR inhibitors in thyroid cancer.11-13,17,19,20
Patients with thyroid cancer may have worse QoL
compared with the overall population34,35 but better QoL
than patients with other cancers.36 Maintenance of
QoL is an important endpoint. A complete evaluation of
the impact of VEGFR inhibitors on QoL in patients with

thyroid cancer has not been previously described. Additional QoL data are needed to further understand the integration of these agents into the therapeutic algorithm.
The small sample size and lack of a control group may
limit the applicability of results from the current trial, yet
the duration of treatment and the minimal change from
baseline QoL observed in this study suggest that the
impact of axitinib on QoL in relatively symptom-free
patients with advanced thyroid cancer may be acceptable.
This trial confirms that axitinib has activity in
advanced thyroid cancer and a favorable safety profile. In
addition, patients with greater axitinib exposure have a
longer PFS, and patient QoL is maintained throughout
treatment.
