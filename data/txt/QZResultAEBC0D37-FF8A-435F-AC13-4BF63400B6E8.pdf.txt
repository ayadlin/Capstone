ABSTRACT
Somatic mutations of the epidermal growth factor receptor often cause resistance
to therapy with tyrosine kinase inhibitor in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In
this study, we aimed to identify partner drugs and pathways that can induce cell
death in combination with gefitinib in NSCLC cells. We undertook a genome-wide
RNAi screen to identify synthetic lethality with gefitinib in tyrosine kinase inhibitor
resistant cells. The screening data were utilized in different approaches. Firstly, we
identified PRKCSH as a candidate gene, silencing of which induces apoptosis of NSCLC
cells treated with gefitinib. Next, in an in silico gene signature pathway analysis of
shRNA library data, a strong correlation of genes involved in the CD27 signaling
cascade was observed. We showed that the combination of dasatinib (NF-κB pathway
inhibitor) with gefitinib synergistically inhibited the growth of NSCLC cells. Lastly,
utilizing the Connectivity Map, thioridazine was identified as a top pharmaceutical
perturbagen. In our experiments, it synergized with gefitinib to reduce p-Akt levels
and to induce apoptosis in NSCLC cells. Taken together, a pooled short-hairpin library
screen identified several potential pathways and drugs that can be therapeutic targets
for gefitinib resistant NSCLC.

INTRODUCTION

of EGFR or a second mutation in the downstream pathway
of EGFR, both resulting in lack of response to EGFR-TKI
[9-11]. Other mechanisms of resistance include either
amplification of c-met [12, 13] or deletion of PTEN [14,
15]. A major therapeutic priority is to identify drugs that
can reverse the TKI resistance in exon 20 mutant EGFR. In
order to discover additional drugs and pathways that might
inhibit growth of NSCLC with an exon 20 mutant EGFR,
we screened with a short-hairpin library for synergism
with gefitinib [16-20] and identified several molecular
biological pathways and pharmaceutical compounds that
inhibited these TKI-resistant NSCLC cells.

Initial broad-based clinical studies found that only
a minority of individuals with non-small cell lung cancer
(NSCLC) responded to either gefitinib or erlotinib, which
are tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) blocking activation
of the epidermal growth factor (EGFR) [1-4]. Asian, nonsmoking females were noted to be particularly sensitive
to this class of drugs [2, 5]. Subsequently, investigators
discovered that sensitivity to these TKIs was correlated
with the presence of somatic mutations that affect the
kinase domain of EGFR, especially either deletions
within exon 19 or a L858R mutation in exon 21 [6-8].
Individuals with these tumors often respond to TKI
therapy, but usually have progressive disease after 6-12
months of therapy. These resistant tumors frequently
acquired either an additional mutation (T790M) in exon 20

NSCLC cells [TKI-resistant, EGFR exon 20 (T790M) and exon 21 mutation] and PC14 NSCLC cells [TKI-sensitive, EGFR exon 19
(delE746-A750)]. Cells were treated with either vehicle or 10 μM gefitinib for 3 days. Data represent the mean and SD of experiments
done in triplicate. (B) H1975 cells were cultured with either vehicle or 10 μM gefitinib after transduction with either a non-target siRNA

with stable silencing of PRKCSH (see panel E) were cultured for 3 days either with or without gefitinib (10 μM) and cell proliferation
was measured (MTT assay). (D) H1975 NSCLC cells either with or without stable silencing of PRKCSH (see panel E) were cultured for

9, caspase 3, cleaved caspase 3 and GAPDH (loading control). Densitometry of bands of cleaved PARP, cleaved caspase 9, cleaved caspase
3 and GAPDH was performed with image J software. Band intensities were normalized to GAPDH band intensity. * p < 0.05, ** p value

the PRKCSH gene was stably silenced in H1975 cells
using lentiviral shRNA vector which markedly enhanced
the gefitinib-related growth inhibition (50% decrease
compared to gefitinib alone) and apoptosis (27% versus
17% with gefitinib alone) (Figs. 1C, D). Silencing of
PRKCSH enhanced the expression of cleaved PARP,
caspase-9 and -3 which was only slightly enhanced by
addition of gefitinib (5, 10 μM) (Fig. 1E).
We next investigated which pathways were linked
to gefitinib-induced cell death based on shRNA library
data using NCI / Nature Pathway Interaction Database
(PID) (http://pid.nci.nih.gav) (Table 2) [21]. The CD27
signaling pathway (including BCL2L1, MAP3K7,
MAP3K10, MAPK10, TRAF5, IKBKB) was identified as
the most significantly affected (p-value: 9.3325 E-05; Fig.
2, Table 2). This pathway relates to activation of NF-κB
and pro-survival signaling. To explore the role of NF-κB
pathway in gefitinib-induced cell death, cells were treated
with dasatinib. Dasatinib is a known inhibitor of multiple
tyrosine kinases (BCR-ABL, SRC family, c-Kit etc) which
inhibits the NF-κB pathway upstream of Src pathway [22,
23].

genes and/or agents that can overcome TKI-resistance
in NSCLC. Initial growth curves (MTT assays) showed
that H1975 NSCLC cells [TKI-resistant, harbors EGFR
exon 20 (T790M) and exon 21 (L858R) mutations] was
more resistant to gefitinib than PC14 cells [TKI-sensitive,
EGFR exon 19 (delE746-A750)] (Fig. 1A). A screen was
conducted for genes that, when silenced, enhanced TKI
sensitivity in H1975 cells. The cells were transduced
with a small hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) pooled library and
a synthetic lethality screen in the presence of gefitinib
was performed. Hairpins targeting 35 genes (from 16,000
genes) reproducibly conferred gefitinib sensitivity in
H1975 cells (threshold relative fold depletion in gefitinib
versus vehicle as log2 ratio and p-value < 0.05; Table 1).
Twenty genes from the initial 35 target genes
identified in the primary screen were examined for their
growth inhibitory effects in gefitinib treated H1975 cells
using independent siRNAs. Five genes (SIRT3, PRKCSH,
REP15, MKRN1, KIAA0323) were confirmed to enhance
the gefitinib-induced inhibition of cell proliferation (Fig.
1B). Silencing the PRKCSH gene produced the most
profound growth inhibition. Therefore, expression of

Treatment of cells with dasatinib promoted gefitinibinduced cell inhibition of proliferation of NSCLC (Fig.
3A). Dasatinib treatment alone did not have a potent
ability to induce cell death of H1975 cells; but when
combined with gefitinib, they significantly increased cell
death (Fig. 3B). Our studies using multiple concentration
of gefitinib and dasatinib showed that co-treatment with
gefitinib (5 or 10 μM) and dasatinib (100, 200 or 400 nM)
synergistically inhibited growth of H1975 cells (CI<1 1-6
columns, Fig. 3C). Also, in contrast to either drug alone,
this drug combination induced apoptosis, as shown by
an increase in caspase 3 cleavage (Fig. 3D). Exposure to
dasatinib attenuated phospho-Src, as well as phospho-Rel
A (Fig. 3D).
In-silico screening using the Connectivity Map
of our shRNA library data identified drugs that could
enhance cell kill by gefitinib (Overview, Fig. 2). In
brief, this correlation-based pattern-matching software
utilizes the input gene signatures from our shRNA library
analysis by RIGER. Based on the degree of difference
between gefitinib and the pharmaceutical perturbagen,
a connectivity score is assigned, and the negative
enrichment score is used to identify a perturbagen inducing
a synergistic effect with gefitinib (Table 3). The top
pharmaceutical compounds were examined. Surprisingly,
the first compound on the list was “thioridazine”, which
has been reported to have antiproliferative activity
against tumor cells [24]. Exposure of H1975 cells to
either thioridazine (10 μM) or gefitinib (10 μM) treatment
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

produced an approximate 25% growth inhibition; when the
two drugs were combined, an appropriate 65% decreased
growth occurred (Fig. 4A). Similarly, the combination of
the two drugs caused cell death (annexin V/propidium
iodine positivity) of about 40% of the lung cancer
cells (H1975) compared to either gefitinib (10 μM) or
thioridazine (15 μM) alone (~ 12% and 14%, respectively)
(Fig. 4B). Furthermore, co-treatment with thioridazine and
gefitinib for 3 days synergistically inhibited the growth of
the lung cancer cells (CI<1, columns labeled 1-4; (Fig.
4C,). Thioridazine (10 μM) and gefitinib (10 μM) alone
(24 hours) did not affect expression of either p-Akt or
p-p70S6K in lung cancer cells; but together, they reduced
levels of these activated signaling pathways (Fig 4D).

DISCUSSION
Almost all patients with a newly diagnosed NSCLC
with either an exon 19 or 21 mutation of EGFR have an
initial response to TKI therapy. However, invariably after
6-12 months, the tumor becomes resistant to therapy,
associated with additional genomic changes especially a
T790M EGFR mutation. Similar to the lessons learned
with HIV therapy, treatment of these NSCLC with more
than one drug may prevent emergence of a drug-resistant
clone. Therefore, we performed a synthetic lethality screen
with gefitinib using a pooled short-hairpin RNA library
in NSCLC cells to help identify pathways druggable in

TKI resistant NSCLC. Furthermore, the shRNA library
data was used for gefitinib-related pathway analysis and
in-silico gene signature based examination.
From the shRNA library screen and siRNA
validation experiments in NSCLC cells, we identified and
validated PRKCSH as a candidate gene that synergizes
with gefitinib (Fig. 1). PRKCSH encodes the noncatalytic β-subunit of glucosidase II (GIIβ). Glucosidase
II facilitates protein translocation and “quality control”
pathways of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Mutation of
this gene is associated with autosomal dominant polycystic
liver disease (PCLD) [25-27]. Silencing of PRKCSH
in NSCLC cells caused decreased cell proliferation
and increase in the proportion of apoptotic cells, and
when combined with gefitinib both these effects were
significantly enhanced (Figs. 1C and D). Identification
of PRKCSH led us to examine PKD2 [28-30]. Both
these molecules are involved in autosomal dominant
polycystic kidney and liver diseases, and PRKCSH
acts as a chaperone-like molecule to regulate PKD2
expression. PKD2 controls the endoplasmic reticulum
(ER) regulated Ca2+ mediated apoptosis by decreasing the
Ca2+ concentration in the ER [26]. Silencing of PKD2 in
NSCLC cells augmented apoptosis when combined with
gefitinib (Supplement Fig. 1B, C). In addition, PKD2
knockdown inhibited activation of the ERK pathway,
which is associated with cell survival (Supplement Fig.
1C). To the best of our knowledge, neither PRKCSH
nor PKD2 has been reported as therapeutic targets for
NSCLC. The use of either PRKCSH or PKD2 inhibitors
in combination with gefitinib to treat NSCLC requires
further study.
Our shRNA library screen also identified the CD27
signaling pathway which relates to activation of NF-κB
and pro-survival signals (Fig. 2 and Table 2). Dasatinib
can modulate the NF-κB pathway; but alone, the drug had
little effect on either apoptosis or proliferation of NSCLC.
However, the combination of dasatinib and gefitinib
synergistically induced cell death and inhibited cell growth
(Fig. 3). Taken together, these experiments suggest that
the combination of NF-κB inhibitors and gefitinib may be
therapeutically effective for EGFR-mutant NSCLC.
The Connectivity Map is a genomic screening
tool for linking genes associated with a selected
phenotype with potential therapeutic agents [31, 32].
To discover additional therapeutic compounds that may
synergistically interact with gefitinib, the shRNA library
data were analyzed using the Connectivity Map software.
Thioridazine, a phenothiazine derivative, was one of the
prominent “hits”. Several reports have noted that the drug
can have anticancer activity [33-35]. The mechanism by
which this is mediated is unclear, although it may occur
by inhibiting the PI3K/Akt pathway. The combined
treatment of thioridazine and gefitinib synergistically
inhibited proliferation of NSCLC cells (Fig. 4C). Neither
thioridazine nor gefitinib suppressed levels of activated
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Akt and p70S6K in NSCLC, but their combination
reduced phospho-Akt and phospho-p70S6K levels in
these cells (Figure 4D). Phenothiazines can cause severe
extrapyramidal side-effects such as tardive dyskinesia.
Thus, further modification of this molecule should be
explored to incorporate the anti-NSCLC effects without
neurological toxicity. Alternatively, phenothiazines
activate PP2A; we (unpublished data) and others [36]
have shown that drugs that activate PP2A have anticancer activity. Novel activators of this phosphatase may
synergize with gefitinib to inhibit growth of EGFR mutant
NSCLC.
In summary, shRNA library screen identified
therapeutic partners of gefitinib for treatment of EGFR
mutant NSCLC including EGFR T790M. Furthermore, the
shRNA library data were utilized for gene signature based
in-silico query which identified PRKCSH as an interesting
partner with gefitinib. Finally, the shRNA results were
used to interrogate the Connectivity Map. This pathway
analysis identified thioridazine as a synergistic partner
of gefitinib. In summary, this study using several
experimental approaches has identified exciting drugs and
pathways for further study in EGFR mutant NSCLC.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Reagents and NSCLC cell lines
The following compounds were used in this study:
gefitinib; dasatinib [LC Laboratories (MA, USA)];
thioridazine (10-[2-(1-methyl-2-piperidyl) ethyl]-2methylthio-phenothiazine) [Sigma Aldrich (Singapore)].
All reagents were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)
and the final concentration of DMSO never exceeded 0.1%
in culture. Antibodies: Akt [36], phospho-Akt (Ser473),
caspase-3, 8, 9, cleaved caspase-3, 8, 9, ERK, phosphoERK, IκBα, phospho-IκBα, p70S6K, phospho-p70S6K
(Thr421 / Ser424), PKD2, PRKCSH, PARP, cleavedPARP, RelA, phospho-RelA, Src, phospho-Src, GAPDH
were purchased from Cell Signaling (MA, USA).
The human NSCLC cell lines H1975 and PC14 were
purchased from the American Type Culture Collection
(Manassas,VA). These cells were cultured in RPMI 1640
supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 U/ml of
penicillin, and 100 μg/ml of streptomycin. The H1975 cell
line has an EGFR T790M mutations in exon 20, associated
with gefitinib and erlotinib resistance. The PC14 cell
line has an EGFR delE746-A750 mutation in exon 19,
associated with TKI sensitivity.

Pooled short-hairpin RNA library screen
H1975 cells were transduced in quadruplicates with
a pooled shRNA library (MISSION® shRNA), consisting
821

Oncotarget

Cell death assays

of 80,000 hairpins targeting 16,000 genes at an MOI of 0.3
hairpins/cell. After 48 hours, puromycin was added to the
media (5 μg/ml) to select for transduced cells.
Puromycin was continuously in the media until cells
were harvested. Following selection, each replicate was
treated with either vehicle or gefitinib (8 μM) for 1 week.
This concentration of gefitinb was identified as the IC50 to
H1975 cells [37]. Cells were harvested and genomic DNA
was isolated both prior to drug treatment and at day 10.
shRNA sequences were amplified by PCR using specific
primers. The purified PCR products were subjected to
high-throughput sequencing using Illumina Genome
Analyzer IIx. The quality of the data was checked,
normalized and statistically analyzed by RNAi gene
enrichment ranking (RIGER) software [38]. Significant
hits were defined as those altered by 2 fold, p<0.05

Cells were harvested and stained with Annexin-V
and PI (BD Biosciences), and analyzed by a FACSCalibur
flow cytometer (BD Sciences). Lower right quadrant
(Annexin-V+/PI-) and upper right quadrant (Annexin-V+/
PI+) were defined as apoptotic cells and necrotic cells,
respectively.

Western blot analysis
Cells were harvested, washed with PBS, and
lysed in ProteoJET Mammalian Cell Lysis Regent
(Fermentas) supplemented with ProteoBlock Protease
Inhibitor Cocktail (Fermentas). Protein concentrations
were measured by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad, Richmond,
CA). Equal amounts of protein were dissolved in SDSpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample loading
buffer and electrophoresed in a polyacrylamide gel
(7.5% or 10%). After electrophoresis, the proteins were
electrotransferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane
(Immobilon, Millipore, Bedford, MA). Immunoblotting
was performed using antibodies mentioned above, and
detected by ECL-Plus reagent (Amersham, Boston, MA).

PRKCSH and PKD2 knockdown cells
Stably knockdown of the expression of the
PRKCSH and PKD2 genes in H1975 cells used lentiviral
shRNA vectors. PRKCSH shRNA plasmid was kindly
provided by Prof. Gard Walz (Renal Division, University
Hospital Freiburg). The PRKCSH shRNA sequence
(5’-CCGGAAGTTCAGTGCCATGAAGTATCT
CGAGATACTTCATGGCACTGAACTTTT TTTG-3’)
was cloned into pLKO.1 vector. PKD2 shRNA plasmid
was constructed according to selected sequences within
the gene and cloned into pLKO.1 vector. (5’-CCGGC
ACGACCAACAGATACTATCTCGAGATAGTATC
TGTTGGTCGTGTTTTTG­-3’). The negative control
shRNA [SHC002 (MISSION® shRNA)] was purchased
from Sigma. Cells were transduced and selected with
puromycin (2 μg / ml, 10 days). Silencing of the genes
were confirmed by western blotting.

Statistical analysis
Data were collected using a minimum of three
experiments and used to calculate the mean ± S.D.
Statistical significance was calculated using either
ANOVA or student-t test and was considered significant
at p values < 0.05.
