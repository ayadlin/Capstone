Abstract
STAT5 fulﬁlls essential roles in hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) self-renewal and chronic myeloid leukemia
(CML), a prototypical stem cell malignancy. However, the speciﬁc contributions of the two related genes STAT5A
and STAT5B have not been determined. In this study, we used a RNAi-based strategy to establish participation of
these genes to CML disease and persistence following targeted therapy. We showed that STAT5A/STAT5B
double-knockdown triggers CML cell apoptosis and suppresses both normal and CML HSC long-term clonogenic
potential. STAT5A and STAT5B exhibited similar prosurvival activity, but STAT5A attenuation alone was
ineffective at impairing growth of normal and CML CD34þ cells isolated at diagnosis. In contrast, STAT5A
attenuation was sufﬁcient to enhance basal oxidative stress and DNA damage of normal CD34þ and CML cells.
Furthermore, it weakened the ability to manage exogenous oxidative stress, increased p53 (TRP53)/CHK-2
(CHEK2) stress pathway activation, and enhanced prolyl hydroxylase domain (PHD)-3 (EGLN3) mRNA expression. Only STAT5A and its transactivation domain-deﬁcient mutant STAT5AD749 speciﬁcally rescued these
activities. STAT5A attenuation was also active at inhibiting growth of CML CD34þ cells from patients with
acquired resistance to imatinib. Our ﬁndings show that STAT5A has a selective role in contributing to stress
resistance through unconventional mechanisms, offering new opportunities to eradicate the most primitive and
tyrosine kinase inhibitor–resistant CML cells with an additional potential to eradicate persistent stem cell
populations. Cancer Res; 73(7); 2052–8. 2013 AACR.

Introduction
Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a clonal hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) malignancy characterized by the unique
t(9:22) chromosome translocation. This generates the BCRABL oncogene, a constitutively activated tyrosine kinase,
which is the primary oncogenic event causing CML (1). This
has made CML a model for targeted therapies by the use
of ﬁrst-generation (Imatinib mesylate, IM) and secondgeneration tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI). Currently,
TKI administration leads rapidly to complete cytogenetic
remission and major molecular response in the majority
of patients with CML. However, BCR-ABL mRNA remains

detectable in the most immature stem/progenitor cells
despite long-term TKI therapy, discontinuation of IM in
patients with complete molecular remission results in
molecular relapse in 60% patients, and clinical resistance
to IM also occurs in approximately 15% patients (2, 3). These
observations highlight the needs to approach mechanisms of
CML persistence.
Activation of STAT5 is a signaling hallmark of CML,
reported more than a decade ago (4). STAT5 plays a central
role in the maintenance of murine and human HSCs from
healthy donors and patients with several types of acute
leukemia (5). Inhibition with a dominant negative mutant of
STAT5 and STAT5 knockdown impair survival of BCR-ABL–
expressing cell lines and short-term clonogenic potential of
primary CML progenitors, respectively (6, 7). In vivo transplantation of BCR-ABL–expressing murine hematopoietic
progenitor cells induces an acute so-called "CML-like"
leukemia in recipient animals, which almost disappears in
STAT5-deﬁcient background. Moreover, STAT5 overexpression rendered v-ABLþ murine BM cells resistant to IM (8).
These observations showed that STAT5 is essential to
the induction of CML-like leukemia by exogenous BCR-ABL
and provides resistance to IM in murine models. Thus,
there is considerable interest in delineating STAT5 contribution to normal and CML HSC maintenance in human
cells.

STAT5 Protects CML Cells from Apoptosis and Stress

STAT5 consists of 2 separate proteins, STAT5A and STAT5B,
which are encoded by 2 closely related genes. Most studies
have made use of STAT5A and STAT5B double deﬁcient mice to
get insight into STAT50 s functions. However, single gene knockout mouse models have reported nonoverlapping functions
of the 2 STAT5s that have been linked to restricted expression
of a single STAT5 in a few tissues, gene dosage effect, or
differential biochemical properties of the 2 factors (9, 10).
In this study, in an attempt to approach mechanisms of
CML persistence, we tracked human STAT5 activities by
differentially knocking down the 2 STAT5 genes in normal
and CML HSC/progenitor cells, using a RNA interference
strategy.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines and primary samples
Umbilical cord blood or adult peripheral blood samples from
healthy donors and CML patients were collected after
informed consent, in accordance with the Declaration of
Helsinki. Patient samples were collected at time of initial
diagnosis or after >18 months of IM (Novartis) treatment.
Mononuclear cells were isolated by density-gradient separation on Ficoll-Paque Plus (GE Healthcare). CD34þ cells were
isolated using a positive magnetic bead selection procedure
(Miltenyi Biotech) and were maintained in IMDM medium
supplemented with 15% BIT (Stem cell Technologies), stem cell
factor (100 ng/mL; Amgen), Flt3 ligand (100 ng/mL), interleukin-3 (50 ng/mL), and thrombopoietin mimetic peptide (10
nmol/L; Sigma-Aldrich) (4F-medium). For long-term culture
assays, CD34þ cells were ﬁrst transduced in 4F-medium and
transferred 24 hours later on MS5 murine stromal cells in LTCIC conditioned medium before ﬂuorescence-activated cell
sorting (FACS)-sorting GFPþ cells at day 4. GFPþ cells were
maintained on MS5 cells for 1 or 5 weeks before cell plating for
colony assays using standard procedures. IM (1.5 mmol/L) was
added to the medium of IM-resistant cells. The resulting
colony-forming cells (CFC) were scored after 14 days of incubation. CML cell lines (MEG01, LAMA84, and K562) were
purchased from cell depository banks. IM-resistant LAMA84
or MEG01 cells were generated using escalating concentrations of IM (from 0.05 to 1 mmol/L) over 4 months. Resistant
cells were maintained in IM (1 mmol/L)-supplemented
medium.
Lentiviral constructs, transductions
The shC, shS5A, shS5B, and shS5A/B sequences (see Supplementary Information) were inserted downstream of the H1
promoter into pTRIPDU3-EF1a, which encodes green ﬂuorescent protein (GFP) or human CD4 as reporters. Murine STAT5A
or STAT5B cDNA were introduced into pTRIPDU3-EF1a ahead
of IRESEMCV-GFP sequence. VSV-G–pseudotyped lentiviral
particles were generated as described (11). About 85% to
98% and 70% to 90% transduction with CML cell lines and
CD34þ cells, respectively, were obtained as measured by GFP
expression. Cells were FACS-sorted when required. All subsequent assays were done at day 7 posttransduction. For rescue
assays, cells were transduced with shRNA/CD4 encoding vectors and maintained in culture for 4 days before adding the

www.aacrjournals.org

cDNA/GFP rescue vectors. Assays were done at day 3 to 5 after
second transduction.
Cytoﬂuorometric analysis
Cell viability and cell cycle were assessed after staining with
AnnexinV/7AAD or propidium iodide (PI). Cell oxidative stress
was assessed by incubating cells for 15 minutes at room
temperature in the dark in the presence of dihydroethidium
(DHE, 5 mmol/L; Life Technologies) and, where indicated,
cyclosporine A (20 mmol/L; Novartis). Cells were preincubated
with H2O2 for 6 hours or VAS2870 (Sigma) for 1 hour. Flow
cytometry was conducted on FACS-Canto II or Accuri (Becton
Dickinson) using anti-CD34-PC5, anti-CD4-PC7, AnnexinV-PE,
7AAD, PI reagents, all from BD Biosciences.
Western blot analysis
Cell extracts were analyzed by standard procedures using
commercially available primary and peroxidase-labeled secondary antibodies (see Supplementary Information). Protein
signals were detected by chemiluminescence (GE Healthcare)
and quantiﬁed using a Fuji-LAS4000 image analyzer.
Immunoﬂuorescence
Immunoﬂuorescence assays were conducted by standard
procedures using anti-gH2Ax (Cell Signaling Technology) or
anti-RAD51 (Pharmingen) antibody and Alexa 546–conjugated
anti-rabbit Ig.
Quantitative PCR
Total RNA was extracted using RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen);
quantitative PCR (qPCR) was conducted using SYBR Green Kit
on a Lightcycler (Roche). Data were normalized to HPRT
mRNA expression.
Statistical analysis
Data were expressed as mean  SEM. Student t test was used
for statistical analysis.

Results and Discussion
STAT5 is required for long-term maintenance of normal
and CML HSCs
We identiﬁed 3 small hairpin RNAs (shRNA) that differentially knockdown human STAT5A and STAT5B factors, thereafter named shS5A, shS5B, and shS5A/B. These were stably
introduced into 3 CML cell lines (K562, LAMA84, and MEG01)
using lentiviral vectors that coencode the GFP dye, and immunoblot analyses of the transduced cells were conducted (Fig. 1A
and Supplementary Fig. S1). ShS5A decreased STAT5A gene
expression only, with no impact on STAT5B, as compared with
untransduced (uT) or control shRNA (shC)-expressing cells.
ShS5B inhibited STAT5B and partially STAT5A expression,
whereas shS5A/B inhibited both STAT5s. Our attempts to
select for other STAT5A- or STAT5B-restricted shRNAs have
been unsuccessful. The shRNAs did not change STAT1/3/6
expression or STAT1/3 tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig.1A and
Supplementary Fig. S1 and data not shown), as opposed to the
compensatory STAT1/3 activation observed in some murine
STAT5A/B double deﬁcient cells (9). Such compensations may

need complete STAT5A/B knockout to occur. Growth properties of the transduced cells were evaluated by analyzing
GFPþ cells along time of culture (Fig. 1B and Supplementary
Fig. S2). ShS5A and shC had no impact on CML cell growth,
regardless of the virus-to-cell ratio used. In contrast, shS5Bþ
and shS5A/Bþ CML cells progressively disappeared. Expression of sh5B and shS5A/B had no impact on cell-cycle phase
transitions (data not shown); however, it induced cell apoptosis, as assessed by AnnexinV staining and poly(ADP-ribose)
polymerase-1 cleavage (Fig. 1C and Supplementary Fig. S1).
ShS5B activity was conﬁrmed by conducting rescue experiments. Murine STAT5B which is insensitive to shS5B reversed
STAT5B expression to endogenous levels in shS5Bþ cells (Fig.
1D, inset); it simultaneously rescued shS5Bþ cell survival, as
assessed by the maintenance of mSTAT5þshS5Bþ doubly
transduced cells in culture (Fig. 1D). These observations
assessed that shS5B activities were not "off-target" effects.
Murine STAT5A was then introduced in place of STAT5B and

2054

Cancer Res; 73(7) April 1, 2013

similarly rescued shS5Bþ cell growth (Fig. 1D). These results
indicated that the 2 STAT5s commonly sustain CML cell
survival. Because shS5A—which inhibited STAT5A only—was
inactive at altering CML cell growth, as opposed to shS5B
which inhibited both STAT5B and STAT5A, the data further
suggested that CML cell growth is sensitive to STAT5 gene
dosage.
We next examined STAT5 activities in the context of primary
CML stem/progenitor cells. ShRNAs were introduced in CML
CD34þ cells that were then assayed for their clonogenic
potential. ShS5B strongly impaired the short-term clonogenic
properties of CML CD34þ cells (P < 0.01), whereas shS5A had
no or only weakly positive effects (Fig. 2A). Also, shS5Bþ—but
not shS5Aþ—CD34þ CML cells showed strongly reduced longterm colony initiating cell (LTC-IC) potential, the most stringent in vitro assays of human HSCs (Fig. 2B). We extended these
experiments to normal (wt) CD34þ cells collected from umbilical cord (CB) and adult peripheral (PB) blood samples.

assays were done on 7 newly diagnosed CML CD34 blood samples
upon shRNA/GFP transduction and GFP sorting. Results are expressed
as the number of clones per 103 initial GFPþCD34þ cells (  , P < 0.01). B,
LTC-IC assays of shRNA/GFPþ CD34þ CML cells; total CFC from LTC-IC

ShS5B—but not shS5A—similarly suppressed LTC-IC potential
of wtCD34þ cells and further inhibited CD34þ cell growth upon
in vitro culture in a minimal 4-cytokine serum-free growth
medium (Fig. 2C and D). Altogether these data indicated that
STAT5 activities sustain long-term maintenance of both
healthy and CML HSCs. These ﬁndings clearly extend previous
reports and show for the ﬁrst time in the context of CML stem
cells, the crucial role of human STAT5 in HSC maintenance.
BCR-ABL activity was shown to provide expansion of CML
progenitors/precursors in a potentially STAT5-dependent
manner (6). However, recent reports showed that primitive
CML HSCs exhibit a BCR-ABL–independent phenotype that
mimics normal microenvironment-dependent HSCs (12);
these CML HSCs are refractory to TKI treatment and sustain
residual disease. Our ﬁndings now indicate that STAT5 may
mediate such crucial stroma-derived signals. STAT5 thus could
be a novel attractive therapeutic target to eliminate the most
immature BCR-ABL–independent CML HSCs.

STAT5A protects cells from stress
Because shS5A did not affect CML cell apoptosis under
standard conditions, we used this tool to address additional
STAT5 roles. shRNAþ-CML cell lines and -wtCD34þ cells were
subjected to oxidative stress by short hydrogen peroxide
(H2O2) treatment and intracellular reactive oxygen species
(ROS) were evaluated by dihydroxyethidium (DHE) staining.
shS5Aþ-CML and -wtCD34þ cells exhibited enhanced ROS
levels in the presence—and also in absence—of H2O2, as
compared to controls. Coincubating DHE with cyclosporine
A, a drug efﬂux inhibitor, improved ROS detection. Basal
production of ROS increased along time after shS5A transduction, which was partially suppressed by the NADPH oxidase
(Nox)–restricted inhibitor VAS2870, in absence of mitochondria dysfunctions (Fig. 3A and Supplementary Fig. S3A and
S3B). ROS trigger genomic stress with basal p53-mediated DNA
damage response (DDR), histone H2AX phosphorylation on
Ser139, and the assembly of gH2AX and RAD51 positive DNA
repair foci. ShS5Aþ-CML cell lines and -wtCD34þ cells showed
an increased proportion of cells with gH2AXþ and RAD51þ
repair foci, as compared with shCþ cells, without RAD51
expression change (Fig. 3B and Supplementary Fig. S3C). As
another source of stress, wtCD34þ cells were allowed to
proliferate at very high concentration for a few days, without
medium change. Cell stress response was analyzed by probing
activation of the well-known ATM-ATR/CHK/p53 stresssignaling pathway. Overconcentrated shS5Aþ cells showed
a strong increase in p53 expression, which was present
under its active [pSer15]-p53 form; cells also exhibited
enhanced [pThr68]-CHK2 level (Fig. 3C). Activation of this
p53/CHK2 stress–response pathway was not detectable by
this approach in normally growing shS5Aþ cells. Overall,
these data indicated that shS5A enhances cell oxidative/
replicative/genomic stress, as compared with controls, and
Nox activity contributes to this action. Nox plays critical
roles in the production of ROS in leukemic cell lines and
normal CD34þ cells; ROS activate STAT5 that associates
with the central Nox regulator Rac1 (13, 14). STAT5A may
thus participate to a negative regulatory loop that limits
cellular ROS. Among ROS cellular sensors is the oxygendependent prolyl hydroxylase domain (PHD) family. All 3
sh5AþCML cell lines showed enhanced PHD3 expression as
compared to controls. This activity was reversed upon
shS5A-resistant murine STAT5A and transcription-deﬁcient
mutant STAT5AD749, but not STAT5B, expression; it was not
duplicated by shS5B that weakly inhibits STAT5A (Fig. 3D).
Collectively, our results indicated that STAT5A exhibits the
restricted property to limit CML and normal stem/progenitor cell stress, independently of its canonical transcriptional
activity. In line with these data, STAT5 downregulates ROS
production in pre-B leukemic cell lines, in absence of
detectable STAT5 tyrosine phosphorylation; oncogenic
activation of STAT5 shows preferential cytoplasmic localization and function in myeloid leukemias including CML
cells (15, 16). Moreover, SRC/ABL kinases differentially affect
nuclear translocation of STAT5A and STAT5B; accumulation
of ROS correlates with reduced STAT5A—but not STAT5B—
activity in aged macrophages; STAT5A shows differential

tions of IM for 2 days. As compared to untreated cells, shS5A
reduced cell viability of IM-treated cells (Fig. 4B). Stable IMresistant cells were further generated from 2 CML (LAMA84
and MEG01) cell lines by increasing IM concentration in
culture medium over 4 months. The resistant cells did not
exhibit overexpressed or overactive BCR-ABL, increased
multidrug resistance pump activity, and overexpressed or
overactive STAT5 (Supplementary Fig. S4). However, shS5A

CD34þ cells did not express enhanced STAT5A or STAT5B
mRNA levels and STAT5A/STAT5B protein ratios (Fig. 4A
and Supplementary Fig. S5). They, however, showed
decreased clonogenic potential upon STAT5A knockdown
(Fig. 4D), as opposed to CML CD34þ cells at diagnosis (Fig.
2A). Altogether, our data indicated that IM-resistant cells
have acquired enhanced STAT5-dependence, as compared
to their sensitive counterparts, by being sensitive to STAT5A
single knockdown. STAT5A has been identiﬁed as 1 of the
4 predictors of secondary IM resistance in CML (19). IMresistant CML cells exhibit increased susceptibility to oxidant treatment because of mitochondrial dysfunction and
high endogenous ROS levels (20). Our ﬁndings now indicate

that human STAT5A could be one of these novel attractive
therapeutic targets to hit ROS oversensitive CML cells and
counteract development of long-term resistance to targeted
therapy.
Collectively, our ﬁndings reveal STAT5s as doubly active
prosurvival and stress protective factors, in primary normal
and CML hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells; they further
show that IM-resistance is associated with enhanced STAT5
dependence of patient stem/progenitor cells. These data highlight the central role of human STAT5s as pleiotropic oncogenic mediators of potential clinical importance in the treatment of CML and its recurrence. Our results could guide new
strategies, based on STAT5 inhibition, for targeting drugresistant CML stem cell population. These novel STAT5 activities may also favor the maintenance, development, and
