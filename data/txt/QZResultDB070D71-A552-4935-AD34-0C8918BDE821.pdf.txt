Abstract
Tumor hypoxia is often linked to decreased survival in patients with breast cancer and current therapeutic
strategies aim to target the hypoxic response. One way in which this is done is by blocking hypoxia-induced
angiogenesis. Antiangiogenic therapies show some therapeutic potential with increased disease-free survival, but
these initial promising results are short lived and followed by tumor progression. We hypothesized that this may
be due to altered cancer stem cell (CSC) activity resulting from increased tumor hypoxia. We studied the effects of
hypoxia on CSC activity, using in vitro mammosphere and holoclone assays as well as in vivo limiting dilution
experiments, in 13 patient-derived samples and four cell lines. There was a HIF-1a–dependent CSC increase in
ER-a–positive cancers following hypoxic exposure, which was blocked by inhibition of estrogen and Notch
signaling. A contrasting decrease in CSC was seen in ER-a–negative cancers. We next developed a xenograft
model of cell lines and patient-derived samples to assess the hypoxic CSC response. Varying sizes of xenografts
were collected and analyzed for HIF1-a expression and CSC. The same ER-a–dependent contrasting hypoxic-CSC
response was seen validating the initial observation. These data suggest that ER-a–positive and negative breast
cancer subtypes respond differently to hypoxia and, as a consequence, antiangiogenic therapies will not be
suitable for both subgroups. Cancer Res; 73(4); 1420–33. 2012 AACR.

Introduction
Hypoxia plays a major role in cancer progression, and areas
of hypoxia are common in both preinvasive and invasive breast
cancer (1, 2). Tumor hypoxia is often linked to decreased
survival in patients with breast cancer and has been shown
to induce speciﬁc molecular changes in cells including changes
that confer a more malignant phenotype such as increased
proliferation (3), survival (4), invasion (5), and metastasis (6).
Cellular responses to hypoxia are mediated by the hypoxiainducible factors (HIF). HIF-a is rapidly degraded in normoxia,
meaning signaling does not occur. In hypoxia, however, HIF-a
dimerises with HIF-b and activates downstream pathways
including, but not limited to, VEGF (7), estrogen (8), and
Notch (9).

Novel therapeutic strategies include inhibitors that target
HIF-1a directly (10) or downstream targets such as VEGF. VEGF
is required for angiogenesis and inhibitors, such as bevacizumab, show some therapeutic potential with increased diseasefree survival. However, initially promising results from these
drugs are short lived and generally followed by regrowth and
progression with no increase in overall survival (11). It has also
been noted that the hypoxia generated by angiogenesis inhibitors can result in more aggressive (12) and invasive (13) tumors.
How tumor cells gain resistance and/or avoid these therapies
and which patients may beneﬁt from these treatments is
currently unknown. One possible mode of therapy avoidance
arises from increased hypoxia within the tumors following antiangiogenic treatments. Breast cancer cells, which survive in
hypoxia, share many characteristics with breast cancer stem
cells (CSC) such as loss of estrogen receptor-a (ER-a) expression (1), increased anoikis resistance (14) and increased resistance to radiotherapy and chemotherapy (15, 16). Hypoxia is
also known to activate CSC pathways, such as Notch (11), and to
initiate epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT; ref. 17).
Recent reports show increased CSC activity following hypoxic
exposure in breast cancer cell lines (18–20), but no reports have
studied this rare population in primary human breast cancer
samples.
We hypothesised that breast CSC numbers would be altered
in hypoxia via dedifferentiation of non-CSC or by expansion of
the CSC subpopulation. As it is known that patients respond
differently to anti-HIF-1a and antiangiogenic treatments (21),
we proposed that these changes would not be consistent in all
subtypes of the disease. The aims of this study, therefore, were

Differential Hypoxic Response in Cancer Stem Cells

to assess the effects of hypoxia on breast CSC in cell lines and
primary samples and to elucidate the mechanism by which
these changes take place.

Materials and Methods
Patient samples
Tumors (MCRC Biobank, project ID:09_GOLA_02) were
dissected into 1 mm pieces and incubated at 37 C for 16
hours in 1 collagenase/hyaluronidase mixture (Stem Cell
Technologies) in Dulbecco's Modiﬁed Eagle's Medium
(DMEM):F12/15 mmol/L HEPES (Sigma). Pleural effusion
and ascites samples were collected during standard drain
protocol with fully informed consent (Ethics#05/Q1403/159).
Cells were centrifuged at 200 g to collect epithelial cells and
remove ﬁbroblasts (22). Blood cells were removed using
Lymphoprep solution (Axis Shield) and magnetic removal
of CD45-positive cells according to the manufacturer's
instructions (Miltenyi Biotech). Cells were cultured in
DMEM:F12/20% fetal calf serum (FCS)/0.1% nonessential
amino acid solution/2.5 mmol/L L-glutamine/PenStrep.
Where possible, cell suspensions were assessed for epithelial
origin using Pan-Cytokeratin (DAKO) staining (Supplementary Fig. S1A and S1B).
Cell lines
MCF7, T47D, MDA-MB-231 (231), and MDA-MB-468 (468)
were purchased from American Type Culture Collection. Lines
were authenticated by multiplex-PCR assay using the AmpF/
STR system (Applied Biosystems) and conﬁrmed as mycoplasma free. Monolayers were grown in DMEM (DMEM/10% FCS/2
mmol/L L-glutamine/PenStrep, MCF7, and T47D), or RPMI
medium (RPMI/10% FCS/1% sodium pyruvate/2 mmol/L Lglutamine/PenStrep, 231, and 468). Cells were maintained in a
humidiﬁed incubator at 37 C at an atmospheric pressure of 5%
(v/v) CO2/air.
Hypoxic cell culture
Cells we incubated for 48 hours in the SCI-tiveN hypoxic
workstation (Ruskinn) in 1% O2, 5% CO2, and 94% N2 in a
humidiﬁed environment at 37 C. Cells were plated, cultured,
and harvested within the workstation to maintain hypoxia at
all times. Conﬁrmation of hypoxic conditions was carried out
using immunohistochemistry to measure expression of HIF-1a
and qRT-PCR to assess upregulation of target genes at the RNA
level (Supplementary Fig. S2A–S2C).
Mammosphere culture
Mammosphere culture was carried out as described in ref.
(23), and spheres were counted on day 5 to avoid counting of
any mammospheres that may have arisen from normal epithelial cells.
Clonogenic culture
Cells were plated at 50 cells per sq. cm in adherent conditions for 10 days. Colonies were ﬁxed and stained with 1%
crystal violet/70% EtOH and were identiﬁed microscopically.
Colonies that had undergone 5 or more divisions, that is,
containing 32 or more cells, were counted (24).

Western blotting
Protein was separated on an SDS–PAGE and transferred to
Hybond-C Extra nitrocellulose membrane. Primary antibodies
included: SP1-ER-a (RM-9101-SO, Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc),
Cleaved N1-ICD (100-401-407, Rockland), Jagged1 (Santa Cruz),
Actin (Santa Cruz, sc-1616), and HIF-1a (610959, BD Biosciences). Densitometry was conducted using ImageJ software,
which is freely available at http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/. Mean
band intensity was measured and fold change from actin
control was calculated.
Flow cytometry
A total of 1  106 cells were resuspended in 1 mL and mixed
with 5 mL of Aldeﬂuor. A total of 0.5 mL was immediately transferred to a control tube containing diethylaminobenzaldehyde
(DEAB). Samples were incubated at 37 C for 30 minutes before
centrifugation to collect the cell pellet. Cells were then resuspended in assay buffer and analyzed using the FACS Calibur.
Quantitative Reverse Transcription PCR
RNA was extracted using the Qiagen RNAeasy kit according to manufacturer's instructions and quantiﬁed on
the Nanodrop spectrophotometer (Thermo). cDNA was
produced using the First Strand Kit (SABiosciences) and
quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) was conducted using RT kit (Sybergreen, SABiosciences) before
analysis on the 7900 PCR machine (Applied Biosystems).
Inhibition of signaling
A total of 10 mmol/L YC1 (Cayman Chemicals), 10 mmol/L
dibenzazepine (DBZ, a kind gift from Adrian Harris, The
Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of
Oxford, Oxford, in 0.5% Methocel/0.1% Tween 80), 1 mmol/L
4-hydroxytamoxifen, or 1 mmol/L geﬁtinib were added to
monolayer culture at time of plating. HIF1 ON-TARGETplus-SMARTpool (L-004018-00-0010, Dharmacon) was used
according to manufacturer's instructions.
Inducible cell line production
For detailed description of cell line production please see ref.
(25).
Transient ER-a expression
Cells were transfected with V16-ERa (Addgene plasmid
11351; ref. 26) using Lipofectamine according to the manufacturer's instructions. VP16 empty vector was used as a control.
Cells were cultured in 21% or 1% oxygen for 48 hours following
transfection and then plated in mammosphere culture.
In vivo tumor formation
Cells were injected subcutaneously into nude mice (MCF7,
231, and 468) and NOD scid gamma mice (primary metastatic,
COB9). Ninety-day slow release estrogen pellets (0.72 mg) were
implanted subcutaneously 2 days before injection (MCF7 only,
Innovative Research of America). Upon collection, xenografts
were cut and half of it was immediately placed in formalin for
embedding. The remaining xenograft was dissociated in the
same way as primary solid tumors.

Differential Hypoxic Response in Cancer Stem Cells

A total of 20 mg/mL YC1 was administered via a single
intraperitoneal injection when tumors reached approximately
100 mm3.
Xenograft embedding and immunohistochemistry
Tumors were formalin ﬁxed and parafﬁn embedded. Antigen retrieval, blocking, and staining were carried out using the
Biogenix i6000. Slides were blocked with hydrogen peroxide
and casein before incubation with the primary antibody (HIF1a—ab1, Abcam; Glut1—ab15309, Abcam). Slides were
then incubated with Envision secondary followed by 3,30
-diaminobenzidine.
Statistical analysis
Data is represented as mean  SEM taken over 3 independent experiments. Statistical signiﬁcance was measured using
parametric testing, assuming equal variance, in the majority of
experiments with standard t tests for 2 paired samples used to
assess difference between test and control samples. In the case
of tumor growth rate, ANOVA with replicates was used for
correlations. Pearson's R2 correlation was calculated for correlation between xenograft size, HIF-1a/Glut1, and mammosphere-forming cells (MFC).

Results
The breast cancer cell hierarchy is affected by hypoxia
To assess hypoxic effects on breast cancer cells, 13 patientderived primary samples and 4 established cell lines were
cultured in 21% or 1% oxygen. As physiologic oxygen levels
vary greatly throughout the tumor, normoxia is extremely
difﬁcult to represent in vitro. With this in mind, atmospheric
oxygen (21%) was compared with a more physiologic 8% to
assess whether this would be suitable as a representation of
"normoxia". No alteration in CSC activity was seen at this
oxygen level and, therefore, 21% oxygen was used to represent
normoxia (Supplementary Fig. S3A). One percent oxygen was
used to represent hypoxia, although levels of oxygen will also
vary within hypoxic regions of tumors. Culture for 48 hours in
hypoxia had no signiﬁcant effect on proliferation or apoptosis
(Supplementary Fig. S3B–S3D). CSC activity was assessed
using well-established in vitro assays including mammosphere
(25, 27) and clonogenic culture (28, 29) and ﬂuorescenceactivated cell sorting (FACS analysis of ALDH1 expression;
ref. 30). CSC Activity was also measured in vivo using limiting
dilution experiments.
MFC number increased signiﬁcantly after hypoxic culture in
all ER-a–positive primary samples and cell lines (Fig. 1A). In
contrast to this, a signiﬁcant decrease in MFC occurred in all
ER-a–negative primary samples and cell lines. The same
pattern was seen in an extended panel of 6 additional cell
lines representing the same subtypes of breast cancer (Sup-

plementary Fig. S3E). Inhibition of HIF-1a, with YC1 (ref. 31;
Supplementary Fig. S4A and S4B), reduced the effect of hypoxic
culture in all cell types (Fig. 1A) but had no effect in 21% oxygen
(Supplementary Fig. S4C and S4D). The same effect was seen in
cell lines using a targeted HIF1 siRNA (Fig. 1B).
As hypoxia is known to increase anoikis resistance (14),
adherent clonogenic culture was used to verify that the
changes in MFC were due to altered CSC activity rather than
increased survival of non-CSC in nonadherent culture (ref. 29;
Supplementary Fig. S5A–S5E). The same hypoxic response
pattern was seen with the CSC-enriched fraction of holoclone-forming cells (HFC) increasing in ER-a–positive lines
and decreasing in ER-a–negative lines after hypoxic culture
(Fig. 1C). Treatment with YC1 had no effect in normoxic
culture but blocked the hypoxia induced clonogenic changes
in MCF7, 231, and 468 returning the HFC number to controls
levels (Fig. 1C). The HFC remained signiﬁcantly increased in
T47D cells treated with YC1, but the effect was markedly
reduced.
Numerous cell surface markers have been shown to identify
a population that is enriched for CSC (25, 30, 32). We measured
the expression of ALDH1 in cell lines following normoxic and
hypoxic culture and, in support of the MFC and HFC data
shown above, show increased ALDH1-positive cell number in
ER-a–positive lines and a contrasting decrease in ERa–negative lines (Fig. 1D).
Tumor initiation is considered to be the gold standard for
CSC measurement, and so an in vivo limiting dilution experiment was carried out to assess changes in tumor-initiating cell
number following hypoxic culture. Fifty percent tumor formation required 3.1  105 hypoxia pretreated MCF7 cells, whereas
6.5  105 control MCF7 cells were required for the same level of
tumor formation suggesting a 2-fold increase in tumor-initiating cells (Fig. 1E). Conversely, 1.5  106 hypoxia pretreated
468 cells are required for 50% tumor formation compared with
9.2  105 control cells suggesting a 0.6-fold decrease in tumorinitiating cells following hypoxic exposure (Fig. 1E). Because of
small sample size, the changes in tumor-initiating cell number
were not signiﬁcant (P > 0.05), but these data are supportive
of the in vitro ﬁndings and suggest that hypoxia may have
a positive effect on the tumor-initiating cell population in ERa–positive breast cancers and a negative effect in ERa–negative tumors.
Hypoxia has long-term effects on the cell hierarchy
We previously showed that the breast cancer cell hierarchy is
strictly maintained and, when altered, the proportion of CSC
returns to normal within 5 to 7 days (33). We were interested,
therefore, to see whether the hierarchy changes seen in hypoxia
would revert to normal once cells were returned to 21% oxygen.
Following in vitro culture in hypoxia, cells were reexposed to

atmospheric oxygen for up to 10 days before mammosphere
culture. At all time points, MFCs remained signiﬁcantly
increased in ER-a–positive cells, which had previously been
treated in hypoxia and signiﬁcantly decreased in ERa–negative cells (Fig. 1F). This ﬁnding shows that the hypoxia-induced changes are not immediately reversed when cells
are reexposed to oxygen suggesting long-lasting effects on the
cellular hierarchy.
Estrogen signaling plays a role in the hypoxic CSC
response
As distinct hypoxic responses were observed between ERa–positive and negative breast cancers, we hypothesized that
the response seen in ER-a–positive cancers was downstream
of ER-a. To conﬁrm ER-a activation, known estrogen-responsive genes were assessed by qRT-PCR following hypoxic culture. Signiﬁcant upregulation of AREG and TFF1 were seen in
both MCF7 and T47D cells as well as upregulation of PIP in
MCF7 cells only (Fig. 2A). To assess whether the ER-a activation is necessary for HIF-1a–induced CSC changes, signaling
was inhibited with 4-hydroxytamoxifen (Tam). Tam signiﬁcantly reduced the hypoxic-MFC increase in all ER-a–positive
cells tested, although in 2 of 6 primary cases, the MFC remained
signiﬁcantly raised compared with control (Fig. 2B).
No effect was seen in ER-a–negative cells. These data
support the hypothesis that ER-a plays an important role in
the hypoxic CSC response in ER-a–positive cells and that
signaling through this pathway is responsible, at least in part,
for the increase in CSC.
It has previously been reported that the CSC within ERa–positive breast cancer have low or no expression of ER-a
(34) similar to normal breast stem cells (SC). In the normal
breast, estrogen-activated ER-positive cells release amphiregulin, which binds to EGFR in the SC facilitating their response
to estrogen despite their ER-negative status (35). To assess
whether this is occurring within breast cancer cells in response
to hypoxia-induced activation of ER-a, EGFR signaling was
blocked with the inhibitor geﬁtinib. Similar to Tam, geﬁtinib
blocked the hypoxic effect in ER-a–positive primary samples
and cell lines but had no effect on ER-a–negative primary
samples or cell lines (Fig. 2C). These ﬁndings are supportive of
the hypothesis that HIF-1a activates ER-a signaling resulting
in a downstream paracrine response through EGFR.
Differential effects on gene expression were identiﬁed in
ER-a–positive and negative cell lines
Custom PCR array plates (SABiosciences, Supplementary
Table S1) were used to assess changes within the total cell and
CSC populations following hypoxic culture. The plates contained genes associated with proliferation and apoptosis, to
conﬁrm our in vitro ﬁndings that no changes occurred, as well
as genes known to identify/enrich for CSC and those involved
in CSC signaling. CSC enrichment was achieved by collection of
anoikis-resistant cells as we have previously shown this population to be highly enriched for mammosphere and tumorinitiating cells (25). Cell lines were cultured for 48 hours in 21%
and 1% oxygen and RNA was collected (termed total population). Alternatively, following normoxic and hypoxic culture,

1424

Cancer Res; 73(4) February 15, 2013

cells were plated in nonadherent culture for 16 hours and RNA
was harvested from the CSC-enriched cells (termed anoikisresistant (AR) population; Supplementary Fig. S6A shows
experimental design). Three independent experiments were
carried out for each cell line.
Comparison of the total population following hypoxic and
normoxic culture showed signiﬁcant gene changes in both ERa–positive and negative lines (Table 1). It is interesting to note
that when comparing these gene expression changes between
ER-a-positive and negative lines, very little correlation was
seen between the cell types, which is supportive of previously
published data (36). Furthermore, no changes in expression of
genes involved in proliferation or apoptosis were seen in the
total population in any lines supporting our in vitro ﬁndings.
These data also add further support to the activation or ER and
Notch signaling in hypoxia with increased expression of ER and
Notch target genes (highlighted in Table 1) in the ER-positive
lines.
Signiﬁcant changes in gene expression between anoikisresistant and total population cells are shown in Table 1.
Increased expression of genes such as ABCG2 (37), CD44 (32),
DNER (38) and ALDH1 (30), and decreased expression of
ESR1 (34) support the use of this CSC enrichment method as
all of these changes are expected in a CSC-enriched population. No signiﬁcant differences were seen between the
normoxic and hypoxic anoikis-resistant populations collected from MCF7 cells and a single signiﬁcant gene change
(PIP) was seen in T47D (Table 1) suggesting that the CSCenriched population remains virtually unchanged following
hypoxic culture and the increase in MFC, HFC, and tumor
initiating cells is, therefore, due to expansion of the population, perhaps by increased symmetric self-renewal of the
CSC or de-differentiation of early progenitor cells, rather
than simply the acquisition of anoikis resistance in non-CSC.
In the case of ER-a-negative cells, however, there is a small
but signiﬁcant decrease in three genes; PTTG1, JAG1 and
KI67 (Table 1) suggesting that the population is altered in
hypoxia. Although small, the decrease in KI67, for example,
could suggest altered proliferation within the CSC enriched
population and may explain the reduced CSC number in
these cells as the total population continues to proliferate at
a normal rate.
Notch signaling is required for the hypoxic CSC response
in ER-a–positive cells
We, and others, have previously reported that Notch activation plays a role in maintenance and proliferation of breast
CSC (25) and that Notch1 is a downstream paracrine mediator
of ER-a (39). The gene expression data presented here also
show upregulation of Notch signaling within ER-a-positive
lines with increased expression of HES1 and JAK1 in response
to hypoxia (Table 1). Activation of Notch signaling by hypoxia
was further assessed by measuring the levels of activated
Notch1-intracellular domain (N1-ICD) and downstream targets at the protein and RNA level. N1-ICD was increased in all
ER-a–positive primary cells and lines following hypoxic culture (Fig. 3A). There was a small but signiﬁcant decrease in ERa-negative cells. Increased expression of JAG1, a ligand and

and cell lines cultured in 1% oxygen reducing the effect of
hypoxic culture. No signiﬁcant effect on the hypoxic response
was seen in ER-a–negative samples or lines and MFC remained
at the same, low levels (Fig. 3D). To further verify Notch's role,
the pathway was inhibited using inducible shRNA cell lines
(Supplementary Fig. S6B). Interestingly, when signaling
through Notch1 and Notch4 were speciﬁcally blocked only
inhibition of Notch1 reduced the hypoxic CSC response (Fig.
3E). This may suggest that the effect seen is occurring within an
early progenitor cell population as Notch4 is thought to
regulate the most primitive CSC population (25).
Expression of ER-a or N1-ICD causes a positive hypoxic
CSC response in ER-a–negative cells
Our data suggest that estrogen and Notch1 regulate the
hypoxic CSC response in ER-a–positive cells. We therefore
asked whether activation of these pathways in ER-a–negative
lines would modify their hypoxic CSC response. ER-a was
transiently overexpressed in 231 and 468 cells using the V16ERa plasmid (Addgene #11351) and expression was conﬁrmed
by Western blot analysis (Fig. 4A). Following hypoxic culture,
the percentage MFC was signiﬁcantly increased in both 231V16 and 468-V16 (Fig. 4B).
Next, to assess the effect of Notch1 activation, 231 cells were
produced that stably expressed doxycycline-inducible N1-ICD
(231-YNICD; ref. 25). A signiﬁcant increase in MFC was
observed in 231-YNICD cells cultured in hypoxia similar to
that seen in ER-a–positive cells (Fig. 4C).
These data support the hypothesis that HIF1a-ERa-Notch1
activation is responsible for the increased CSC seen in ERa–positive cells and suggest that ER-a–negative cells can be

converted to show a positive hypoxic CSC response by expression of ERa or Notch1.
The hypoxic effect on CSC can be modeled in vivo
In vitro analysis of CSC activity is a valuable and accurate
technique, but an in vivo model with varying degrees of
hypoxia would allow more realistic analyses of the link
between tumor growth, CSC and the potential divergent
inﬂuence of hypoxia on CSC activity. To mimic the in vitro
hypoxic response in vivo, we developed a xenograft model
based on the hypothesis that with increasing xenograft sizes,
there will be a parallel increase in hypoxia due to rapid cell
proliferation and restricted blood supply to the xenograft
cells. MCF7, 231, and 468 lines and an ER-a–positive metastatic sample (COB) were implanted subcutaneously into
mice, and xenografts were harvested at different time points;
half was embedded in parafﬁn for immunohistochemical
analysis, whereas half was dissociated for mammosphere
culture. HIF-1a and GLUT1 staining was quantiﬁed by image
analyses (Supplementary Fig. S7A and S7B) and a signiﬁcant
correlation between tumor size and both HIF-1a and Glut1
expression was observed in xenografts produced from all cell
types validating the hypothesized link between xenograft
size and the presence of hypoxia (Fig. 5A).
In ER-a–positive xenografts (MCF7 and COB, primary metastatic cancer cells), size was strongly correlated with MFC,
and as the xenograft increased in volume, the proportion of
MFCs within the tumor increased (Fig. 5Bi). Importantly, an
inverse correlation was observed for ER-a–negative lines with
a decrease in the proportion of MFC within the xenograft as
tumor size increases (Fig. 5Bii). No correlations were seen

between MFC number and growth rate or total viable cell
number extracted (Supplementary Fig. S7C and S7D).
Intraperitoneal injection of the HIF-1a inhibitor, YC1, following tumor initiation reduces the hypoxic CSC effect in
MCF7 xenografts and results in no correlation between xenograft size and MFC (Fig. 5C).
This xenograft model fully supported our in vitro ﬁndings of
a contrasting link between hypoxia and CSC in ER-a–positive
and negative breast cancer subtypes.

Discussion
We describe differing CSC responses to hypoxia in ERa–positive and negative breast cancer with ER-a–positive
cancers gaining increased CSC activity and ER-a–negative
cancers showing reduced CSC. Earlier reports support the
observed hypoxia induced increase in CSC in breast cancer
cell lines (18–20), but the ER-a–dependent contrasting
reaction has not been reported elsewhere. Although the
differing effects of hypoxia reported here are in conﬂict
with previously published data, where no contrasting effect
was seen (18–20), our data was produced using 13 primary
breast cancer samples, as well as established cell lines, and
the opposing effects in hormone receptor–positive and
negative tumors, measured using multiple in vitro and in
vivo CSC assays, were consistent in all cases. Similar contrasting effects of hypoxia have been reported elsewhere
relating to other key biological features such as cell-cycle
regulation, growth, migration, and gene expression
(6, 20, 41). The reason for these differential effects of hypoxia
may be due to the complex regulation of HIF-1a activities by
various subunits, posttranslational modiﬁcations, and the
presence and effects of coregulators, which are known to
vary between different cell types (6).

www.aacrjournals.org

Interestingly, the observed effects of hypoxia were relatively
long lasting (Fig. 1F) and were not reversed immediately upon
re-exposure to oxygen. This suggests that occasional exposure
to hypoxia either induced by treatments or endogenously
present, as often observed in ductal carcinoma in situ and in
high-grade tumors, could have profound long-term effects on
the CSC content and consequently tumor aggressiveness. The
ﬁndings may also elucidate the divergent behaviours of breast
cancer metastases with the existence of late recurrences in ERa–positive breast cancer but fewer late events in ERa–negative cases. Dormant tumor cells in a hypoxic bone
marrow niche (19) will be enriched for CSC in ER-a–positive
breast cancer but depleted in ER-a–negative cancers profoundly inﬂuencing the capacity for late disease recurrence.
How these long term effects occur is currently unknown and
this requires further investigation. One possibility is that
hypoxia induces epigenetic changes within the cells that can
persist for some time. Similar lasting effects have previously
been reported as risk factors for other diseases such diabetes
with temporal spikes in glucose stress leading to long-term
activating epigenetic changes in p65 and NF-kB (42).
To mechanistically explain the effect of hypoxia on CSC, we
assessed the roles of ER-a and Notch signaling. Inhibition of
ER-a blocked the hypoxic CSC response in all ER-a–positive
cells, supporting the role of estrogen signaling in the hypoxic
response. We also show that, like in the normal breast (35),
estrogen signaling causes downstream activation of EGFRERK signaling and that this is required for the hypoxic
response. Our ﬁndings suggest that this is also true in breast
cancer as EGFR inhibition blocked the hypoxic CSC effect in
ER-a–positive tumors.
Notch inhibition also blocked the hypoxic CSC effect in all
ER-a–positive patient-derived samples and cell lines and

speciﬁcally, Notch1 seemed to be central for the hypoxic CSC
response. In the case of ER-a–negative breast cancer, no
activation of Notch was observed suggesting, in this setting,
that Notch is activated downstream of ER-a. There are contradictions in the literature regarding crosstalk between the
estrogen and Notch pathways and some reports suggest that

1430

estrogen activation inhibits Notch signaling (43) whereas
others, in line with the ﬁndings in this study, report Notch
activation by estrogen (39). It is possible that Notch regulation
by estrogen is context dependent, but our data clearly show
that hypoxia activates estrogen signaling, resulting in increased
Notch1 cleavage and activation of downstream targets.

Differential Hypoxic Response in Cancer Stem Cells

As the mechanistic studies suggest that ER-a and Notch are
central in mediating the unfavourable hypoxic CSC response in
ER-a–positive breast cancer, they may offer an attractive
combination treatment approach, which would consist of
ER-a or Notch inhibitors combined with antiangiogenic drugs.
This would bypass the potential adverse effects of hypoxia on
the CSC fraction while limiting tumor progression due to the
general vasculature effects.
Understanding the inherent negative hypoxic CSC response
in ER-a–negative tumors will be of great value for the development of additional novel treatments as activating this
response alone in cancer cells or alongside antiangiogenic
treatments may offer a more successful treatment with loss
of CSC activity and reduced breast cancer recurrences. There
may be a certain level of complexity in elucidating the mechanisms involved in this negative response as we have shown that

the response can be easily altered with expression of either ERa or N1-ICD, and this suggests that the intrinsic hypoxic
response of these cells can be overcome quite simply.
An important question is how the CSC fraction is altered by
hypoxia. Changes in the CSC fraction in relation to non-CSC
could be due to altered proliferation, self-renewal, or cell death
rates or dedifferentiation of non-CSC into a less mature cell
state any of which would result in a change to the balance
between the 2 compartments (44, 45). Figure 6A and B show
putative models of the hypoxic effects in breast cancer. As we
did not observe any proliferation or apoptosis differences in
the non-CSC or the CSC-enriched fraction in ER-a–positive cell
lines, we hypothesize that either self-renewal symmetry is
altered or cells are caused to dedifferentiate resulting in the
increased CSC numbers seen. For ER-a–negative breast cancer, there was a slight difference in proliferation for the CSC-

cells are hierarchically organized and
contain primitive CSC, early
progenitor cells with some limited in

transit-amplifying cells, and more
differentiated cells. Possible modes
of hierarchy alteration are suggested
as increased self-renewal (a),
dedifferentiation of early progenitor
cells (b), and blocked proliferation (c)
of ER-a–positive and negative
tumors.

enriched cells suggesting that for this subtype of breast cancer,
it may be a combined differentiation and proliferation changes
within different subpopulations causing the decrease in CSC
under hypoxia, but this requires further investigation.
Our xenograft experiments clearly show that as xenograft
size increases, and therefore, extent of hypoxia within the
tumor increases, there is a profound effect on CSC number.
However, the direction of this effect is dependent upon the ERa status of the tumor mimicking our in vitro data. These results
clearly indicate that analysis of future xenograft experiments
should take careful note of the size of the xenografts as well as
how hypoxia inﬂuences CSC in the speciﬁc cell line used. On
the other hand, the model system presented within this study
will be important in examining the effectiveness of new agents
that affect the hypoxia-driven changes in CSC number in ERa–positive and negative breast cancer.
Inhibiting angiogenesis, and thus limiting nutrient supply to
a tumor, is an attractive method to treat cancer and so
treatments targeting HIF-1a or VEGF have been developed
and are currently in clinical trials (10, 11). Both of these novel
therapies have, however, shown varying clinical results with
disappointing cancer recurrences after initially promising
responses (13, 46). The data presented in this article suggests
that tumor subtype needs to be taken into account during
treatment design as blocking angiogenesis and therefore
increasing tumor hypoxia may be beneﬁcial in the treatment
of ER-a–negative breast cancer but could have catastrophic
effects on ER-a–positive breast cancer. This is supported by
recently published data in the New England Journal of Medicine
(21), where patients with triple-negative breast cancer were
seen to show increased complete pathologic response to
bevacizumab treatment, with no detectable tumor at primary
or metastatic sites, whereas no improvement was observed in
hormone receptor–positive cases.
As ER-a is considered a reliable biomarker in immunohistochemical analyses and is already used to guide endocrine
treatment it would be a suitable treatment predictive marker
for antiangiogenic therapies. Future studies need to clarify
whether smaller subgroups of breast cancer, deﬁned according

to expression array criteria, will behave in ways similar to ERa–positive or negative breast cancer but it is clear that the 2
major disease subgroups, deﬁned by ER-a status, show contrasting hypoxic CSC responses.
In summary, our novel data suggest that ER-a–positive and
negative breast cancer subtypes respond differently to hypoxic
exposure and as a consequence, anti-HIF-1a or antiangiogenic
therapies will not be suitable for both subtypes. Finally, the
ﬁndings will form a foundation for novel cancer treatment
principles targeting or enhancing the hypoxic CSC response
within various combination treatment approaches.
