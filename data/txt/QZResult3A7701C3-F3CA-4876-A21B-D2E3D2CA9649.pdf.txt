BACKGROUND: Nausea and vomiting in patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) can be from various
causes, including the use of high-dose cytarabine. METHODS: The authors compared 2 schedules of palonosetron
versus ondansetron in the treatment of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) in patients with AML
receiving high-dose cytarabine. Patients were randomized to: 1) ondansetron, 8 mg intravenously (IV), followed by
24 mg continuous infusion 30 minutes before high-dose cytarabine and until 12 hours after the high-dose cytarabine
infusion ended; 2) palonosetron, 0.25 mg IV 30 minutes before chemotherapy, daily from Day 1 of high-dose cytarabine up to Day 5; or 3) palonosetron, 0.25 mg IV 30 minutes before high-dose cytarabine on Days 1, 3, and 5.
RESULTS: Forty-seven patients on ondansetron and 48 patients on each of the palonosetron arms were evaluable for
efficacy. Patients in the palonosetron arms achieved higher complete response rates (no emetic episodes plus no rescue medication), but the difference was not statistically significant (ondansetron, 21%; palonosetron on Days 1-5, 31%;
palonosetron on Days 1, 3, and 5, 35%; P ¼.32). Greater than 77% of patients in each arm were free of nausea on Day
1; however, on Days 2 through 5, the proportion of patients without nausea declined similarly in all 3 groups. On Days
6 and 7, significantly more patients receiving palonosetron on Days 1 to 5 were free of nausea (P ¼.001 and P ¼.0247,
respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The daily assessments of emesis did not show significant differences between the
study arms. Patients receiving palonosetron on Days 1 to 5 had significantly less severe nausea and experienced sigC 2010 American Cancer

Cytarabine-containing regimens have been the cornerstone of the treatment of acute myelogenous leukemia
(AML) for the last 30 years. Nausea and vomiting in patients with hematologic malignancies can be from several causes.
The use of high-dose cytarabine in combination with other agents is probably the most important causative factor. Few
studies have addressed the issue of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) in patients with hematologic
malignancies.1-3 One study indicated that >70% of such patients are emesis-free during the first 24 hours of chemotherapy, but <50% of them remain emesis-free after the first 24 hours.3 Hence, there is a need to explore options to reduce
late CINV (>24 hours) in patients with hematologic malignancies.
The pathophysiology of CINV is still incompletely understood. One proposed mechanism is the local or systemic
release of neurotransmitters secondary to cellular injury induced by chemotherapy. The major excitatory neurotransmitters involved in emesis are 5-hydroxytriptamine (5-HT; serotonin) and dopamine.4

Palonosetron hydrochloride is a novel, potent, and
selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonist. Studies done in
patients with different types of solid tumors receiving
moderately or highly emetogenic multiday chemotherapy
have demonstrated that palonosetron is effective in preventing CINV during the first 24 hours after chemotherapy and also provides excellent protection against delayed
CINV.4-6 Extensive in vitro and in vivo pharmacological
studies of palonosetron showed it has a high binding affinity and specificity for 5-HT3 receptors7 and an extended
elimination half-life of approximately 40 hours. Palonosetron has been associated with low incidences of adverse
events. Although the efficacy of palonosetron has been
demonstrated in patients receiving highly emetogenic
chemotherapy,4,8-13 its use in patients with hematologic
malignancies has not yet been investigated.
Given that palonosetron has high receptor binding
affinity and a prolonged half-life, we compared 2 schedules of palonosetron versus ondansetron given by continuous intravenous (IV) infusion (our standard of care) in the
treatment of CINV in patients with acute leukemia.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
Adults (>18 years old) with AML or high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome undergoing induction chemotherapy or
first salvage regimen with high-dose (>1.5 g/m2 up to
5 days) cytarabine-containing regimens (including but
not limited to cytarabine plus idarubicin [12 g/m2 for
3 days] and cytarabine plus fludarabine [30 g/m2 for
5 days]) were eligible for this study. Exclusion criteria
included emesis or nausea 24 hours before chemotherapy, ongoing emesis because of any organic etiology, and
known hypersensitivity to ondansetron or palonosetron
or to other selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonists.
The protocol was approved by the institutional
review board. All patients gave written informed consent
before being registered in the study.
At enrollment, patients were randomized to 1 of 3
arms. In Arm 1, patients received 8 mg of ondansetron as an
IV bolus over 15 minutes, followed by 24 mg of ondansetron given by continuous IV infusion starting 30 minutes
before the cytarabine infusion and lasting until 12 hours after the cytarabine infusion ended. In Arm 2, patients
received 0.25 mg of palonosetron as an IV bolus over 30 seconds, 30 minutes before the start of chemotherapy daily
from Day 1 of cytarabine treatment up to 5 days, depending
of the duration of the cytarabine infusion. In Arm 3,

5660

patients received 0.25 mg of palonosetron as an IV bolus
over 30 seconds, 30 minutes before the start of chemotherapy on Days 1, 3, and 5 of cytarabine treatment.
All patients were required to stop taking antinausea
drugs before the first dose of study medication. All
patients received methylprednisolone 40 mg as an IV
bolus before each cytarabine infusion to prevent cytarabine side effects. Because the patients in this study were already deeply immunosuppressed, no other steroid use was
permitted during the study. Concomitant medications
and therapies deemed necessary for supportive care were
allowed. All patients received antiviral (valacyclovir
500 mg by mouth daily), antibacterial (levofloxacin
500 mg by mouth daily), and antifungal prophylaxis (voriconazole 200 mg by mouth twice per day).
Patient diaries were used to record emetic episodes, severity of nausea (none, mild, moderate, or severe), use of rescue medications, and the impact of nausea and vomiting
(not at all, a little, quite a bit, or very much) on daily activities (eating and sleeping), on ability to think and reason
(reading and hobbies), and on physical activities (walking).
Patients were followed for a total of 7 days, starting
with the first day of chemotherapy.
Complete response was defined as no emesis episodes and no use of rescue medication during the study
period (7 days). Partial response was defined as 1 episode of emesis during the entire 7-day study period, no
use of rescue medication during the study period, and no
more than moderate nausea (grade 2, National Cancer
Institute [NCI] Common Toxicity Criteria) during
chemotherapy. Time to treatment failure was defined as
the time to first need for rescue medication or first emesis
episode, whichever occurred first.
Patients were removed from the study if they developed NCI grade 4 nonhematologic toxicity related to
ondansetron or palonosetron or if they asked to be removed
from the study. To be included in the efficacy evaluation,
patients had to have received study drug during the time on
cytarabine infusion and had to have filled out the diary.
Statistics Considerations
The primary endpoint of the study is the prevention of emesis episodes and no use of rescue medication during the
administration of chemotherapy (assessed as complete
response). A maximum of 150 patients was planned to be
recruited for the study, 50 patients in each arm. We modeled
the probability of complete response using a Bayesian monitoring rule for futility. Implementation of the monitoring
rules was applied only after every 15th patient was enrolled

and had been evaluated for complete response, and subsequently periodic assessments were conducted.
Categorical data were tabulated by frequency and percentage; continuous variables were summarized using descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation, median,
range). Chi-square test, Fisher exact test, and its generalizations were used to assess the associations between categorical variables such as association of treatment and response.
Logistic regression models were fit for univariate and multivariate analyses to evaluate the effects of covariates on nausea or vomiting occurrence. For the multivariate analysis,
initially a full logistic model was fit, including age, sex, performance score, treatment, infection at start, use of antibiotic at start, and type of antifungal (AF) as covariates. A
backward elimination procedure was then used for model
selection, with variables removed 1 at a time until all the
variables retained in the model were significant at the .05
level, using SAS 9 (SAS Corporation, Cary, NC).

RESULTS
Patient Demographics and Baseline
Characteristics
From October 2005 to April 2008, 150 patients were registered in the study. One hundred forty-three patients
were evaluable for efficacy: 47 patients in the ondansetron
arm and 48 patients in each palonosetron arm. Seven
patients were excluded from the analysis; 2 patients were
transferred to the medical intensive care unit, and thus no
efficacy evaluation could be done; 2 patients did not
receive chemotherapy, and thus no study drug was given;
1 patient received only 1 dose of study drug, because his
chemotherapy was placed on hold; 1 patient received 2
antiemetic drugs; and 1 patient had severe headache after
2 doses of study drug and decided to withdraw from the
study. This last patient was included in the safety analysis.
Patient characteristics are summarized in Table 1. The
treatment groups were similar with respect to baseline

characteristics. All 3 treatment groups were similar with
respect to the type of chemotherapy administered. All
patients in all 3 arms had good performance status (Zubrod
score 2).
Efficacy
Patient responses to the study drugs are shown in Table 2.
Although more patients in the palonosetron arms than in
the ondansetron arm achieved a complete response, this
difference was not statistically significant. Similarly, fewer
patients in the palonosetron arms than in the ondansetron
arm had treatment failure, but the difference was not statistically significant.
The proportions of patients without nausea on each
study day are shown in Figure 1 (Top). On Day 1, >77%

5662

of the patients in each arm were free of nausea. On Days 2
through 5, the proportion of patients without nausea
declined similarly in all 3 groups. On Days 6 and 7, significantly more patients receiving palonosetron on Days 1 to 5
than those receiving ondansetron were free of nausea
(P ¼ .001 and P ¼ .0247, respectively). The daily assessments of emesis did not show significant differences between
study arms in the number of patients without emesis
(Fig. 1, Bottom). Similar to the nausea results, fewer patients
in the palonosetron arms than in the ondansetron arm
reported emesis. The falloff after Day 1 in the number of
patients without emesis was less pronounced than the falloff
after Day 1 in the number of patients without nausea.

No between-group differences in the severity of nausea
were observed during Days 1 to 5.
Risk Factors for Nausea
Table 3 shows the variables that predicted the development of nausea. On univariate analysis, predictors of nausea included: female sex, younger age, good performance
status, receiving high-dose cytarabine with idarubicin,
receiving prophylactic antibiotics, and not having infection at the start of chemotherapy. In the multivariate analysis, the independent predictors were: younger age,
receiving high-dose cytarabine with idarubicin, and
receiving prophylactics antibiotics.
Rescue Medication
Median time to use of rescue medication was 2 days (range,
1-7) for patients receiving ondansetron, 1 day (range, 1-7)

Adverse Events
The most common treatment-related adverse events were
constipation and headache. Twenty-two (15%) patients
reported NCI grade 1 to 3 adverse events possibly or probably related to ondansetron or palonosetron. Three
patients, 1 in each arm, developed NCI grade 3 adverse
events. One patient in the ondansetron arm and 1 in the
palonosetron on Days 1 to 5 arm reported grade 3 headache, and 1 patient in the palonosetron on Days 1, 3, and
5 arm had grade 3 diarrhea. No cardiac adverse events
considered possibly or probably related to ondansetron or
palonosetron were reported.
Impact of CINV on Daily Activities
Patients recorded the impact of CINV on daily activities
in a diary during the study period. No differences were
found among the 3 groups, except on Day 6, when significantly more patients who received palonosetron on Days
1 to 5 reported a minimal effect of CINV on their activities (Fig. 3).

DISCUSSION
This study is the first prospective randomized trial of
medications for the prevention of CINV in patients with
AML or high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome. Palonosetron given daily from Day 1 up to Day 5 of chemotherapy
significantly reduced the incidence of nausea on Days 6
and 7. In addition, patients receiving that regimen had
significantly less severe nausea on Days 6 and 7 and experienced significantly less impact of CINV on daily activities than patients receiving the other 2 regimens.
Although CINV is frequent in patients with hematologic malignancies, the extent of the problem and
options to reduce CINV have received little attention. A
search of the English literature in PubMed using the
search terms ‘‘emesis treatment’’ and ‘‘acute leukemia’’
returned only 2 publications.1,2 Braken and colleagues1
published a small trial of 18 patients with AML who
received 8 mg of ondansetron as an IV loading dose 30
minutes before the start of chemotherapy, followed by 2
tablets of 8 mg of ondansetron on Day 1. On Days 2 to
10, patients received 3 tablets of 8 mg of ondansetron
each day. During the first cycle, the complete response
rate (patients without vomiting) was 50%, and the partial
response rate (patients with no more than 1-5 episodes of
vomiting in 10 days) was 28%, for an overall response rate
of 78%. The overall response rates in patients who

5664

received subsequent cycles of chemotherapy were 72% in
the second cycle and 80% in the third cycle.
The second study was published by Musso and colleagues.2 In their prospective study, 46 patients with different malignancies (23 with non-Hodgkin lymphoma, 8
with Hodgkin disease, 14 with AML, and 1 with solid
tumor) received palonosetron 0.25 mg by IV infusion and
dexamethasone 8 mg by IV infusion 15 minutes before
starting chemotherapy. The rate of CINV in these
patients was compared with the rate of CINV in a historical group of patients with similar characteristics who
received ondansetron (8 mg by IV infusion) and dexamethasone (8 mg by IV infusion) before starting chemotherapy. The results of this trial demonstrated that 80% of
the patients receiving palonosetron did not develop
CINV, compared with 60% of patients in the historical
control group who received ondansetron (P ¼ .04).
In our study, the overall response rates with palonosetron (31% and 35%) were lower than the response rates
in the studies by Braken et al and Musso et al1,2 and also
lower than the response rates in studies of palonosetron in
patients with other types of cancer.9,10,13,14 The differences in response rates may be because of differences in the
type of underlying disease, or in the chemotherapy given
and its risk for emesis. Patients with AML have unique
characteristics specific to the treatment of leukemia that

Cancer

Palonosetron in Delayed CINV/Mattiuzzi et al

may affect the incidence of CINV and the efficacy of
antiemetic therapy. These include the specific dietary
restrictions common for leukemia patients; the use of prophylactic antibiotic, antifungal, and antiviral agents in all
patients with leukemia; the frequent need for IV administration of antibiotics or antifungals, usually in multidrug
combinations, during the course of treatment for leukemia; and psychological issues (eg, issues because of isolation in laminar airflow rooms). Also, cytarabine and many
of the agents that are given together with cytarabine are
standard agents for AML but are seldom used in chemotherapy combinations for solid tumors. Thus, comparisons of palonosetron for AML versus palonosetron for
solid tumors will be subject to effects of different underlying diseases and of different chemotherapies.
In the study by Musso et al, only 14 of the 46
patients had AML, and only 7 patients received a highdose cytarabine-containing regimen. Similarly, 14 of the
18 patients reported by Braken et al were given a standard
dose of cytarabine (200 mg/m2). Cytarabine at a dose of
1000 mg/m2 carries a low risk of emesis (incidence of
emesis without antiemetics, 10%-30%). All of our
patients were treated with high-dose cytarabine (>1.5
mg/m2) and either fludarabine or idarubicin. Cytarabine
and idarubicin carry a risk of emesis without antiemetics
of 30% to 90%.
The impact of the unique features of patients with
leukemia is demonstrated by the results of the univariate
and multivariate analysis reported in our study. Younger
patients, patients who received cytarabine in combination
with idarubicin, and patients who received prophylactic
antibiotics were at higher risk for nausea. Importantly,
receipt of cytarabine plus idarubicin was the most important risk factor (odds ratio, 3.27; P ¼ .04). This is the first
time that an antileukemic regimen has been described as a
significant factor associated with nausea.
Although all 3 antiemetic regimens tested offered
effective protection against nausea during the first 24
hours after initiation of chemotherapy, the proportion of
patients free of nausea during Days 2 to 5 was markedly
lower in all 3 study arms, and the severity of nausea was
higher. Similar results have been reported in studies done
in children with acute lymphocytic leukemia.3,15 A possible explanation for these results is that the emetogenic
effect of the 2 chemotherapy agents overlaps during these
days. During Days 2 to 5, a different type of antiemetic,
other than a 5-HT3 serotonin receptor antagonist, may
need to be added. In relation to this, the combination of
aprepitant (a neurokinin-1 receptor antagonist) and a

Cancer

December 15, 2010

5-HT3 receptor antagonist has been shown to have an
improved antiemetic effect in patients receiving highly
emetogenic chemotherapy for different types of cancer.16,17 Although patients with hematologic malignancies were not included in these studies, the combination
of aprepitant and a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist is an
attractive option that should be considered in patients
with leukemia.
The results of our study confirm previous reports on
the superiority of palonosetron over the first generation
5HT-3 receptor antagonists in reducing the incidence of
delayed nausea. This is, however, the first study that demonstrates this effect in patients with leukemia.
With respect to daily activities, our results show that
patients randomized to either of the palonosetron regimens reported less interference with daily activities than
did patients in the ondansetron arm on each study day.
However, the difference was significant only on Day 6.
Palonosetron was well tolerated. The incidences of
headache and constipation, the most frequent adverse
events in both palonosetron arms, were similar to those in
previous reports.6,9
In conclusion, palonosetron given daily for 4 or 5 days
significantly reduced the incidence and severity of nausea on
Days 6 and 7 in patients with AML receiving multiple-day
chemotherapy with a high-dose cytarabine-containing regimen. Patients receiving that regimen experienced significantly less impact of CINV on daily activities on Day 6.
Our findings indicate that although 5-HT3 serotonin receptor antagonists have high efficacy against CINV during the
first 24 hours of chemotherapy, this protection is less effective on Days 2 to 5, because >40% of patients develop nausea during that period. It will be important to investigate
whether combinations of different classes of antiemetics will
result in better protection during these days.
