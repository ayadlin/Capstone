ABSTRACT
In the treatment of metastatic melanoma, a highly therapy-refractory cancer,
alkylating agents are used and, for the subgroup of BRAFV600E cancers, the B-Raf
inhibitor vemurafenib. Although vemurafenib is initially beneficial, development of
drug resistance occurs leading to tumor relapse, which necessitates the requirement
for combined or sequential therapy with other drugs, including genotoxic alkylating
agents. This leads to the question whether vemurafenib and alkylating agents act
synergistically and whether chronic vemurafenib treatment alters the melanoma cell
response to alkylating agents. Here we show that a) BRAFV600E melanoma cells are
killed by vemurafenib, driving apoptosis, b) BRAFV600E melanoma cells are neither
more resistant nor sensitive to temozolomide/fotemustine than non-mutant cells,
c) combined treatment with vemurafenib plus temozolomide or fotemustine has an
additive effect on cell kill, d) acquired vemurafenib resistance of BRAFV600E melanoma
cells does not affect MGMT, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2 and MLH1, nor does it affect the
resistance to temozolomide and fotemustine, e) metastatic melanoma biopsies
obtained from patients prior to and after vemurafenib treatment did not show a
change in the MGMT promoter methylation status and MGMT expression level. The
data suggest that consecutive treatment with vemurafenib and alkylating drugs is a
reasonable strategy for metastatic melanoma treatment.

INTRODUCTION

and temozolomide (TMZ) are used, which have the same
therapeutic index [3]. DTIC needs metabolic activation
by cytochrome P450 [4] whereas TMZ decomposes
spontaneously [5] both giving rise to the DNA reactive
methylating species 5-(3-methyltriazen-1-yl)imidazole4-carboximide (MTIC). The main killing DNA lesion
induced by DTIC and TMZ in tumor cells is O6methylguanine (O6MeG) [6]. O6MeG needs processing
by the DNA mismatch repair (MMR) proteins MSH2,
MSH6, PMS2 and MLH1, which converts it during
replication into DNA double-strand breaks (DSB) that
trigger apoptosis [7] and senescence [8]. The damage also
induces autophagy, which in glioma cells counteracts the

Malignant melanoma is a highly therapy-refractory
cancer, contributing significantly to the worldwide
cancer-related mortality [1]. In the metastatic stage (stage
IV) it has a dismal prognosis and treatment requires
systemic therapy for disease control. Over the last 30
years different treatment modalities have been used,
including immunotherapy with high-dose interleukin-2
or interferon-α and/or cytotoxic chemotherapeutics such
as alkylating drugs, i.e. methylating and chloroethylating
agents [2]. For methylating agents dacarbazine (DTIC)

killing response to TMZ [9].
In contrast to DTIC and TMZ, chloroethylating
agents such as lomustine, nimustine, carmustine and
fotemustine (FM) induce O6-chloroethylguanine
(O6ClEtG) in the DNA, which is the principal critical
cytotoxic DNA damage. O6ClEtG is unstable and is
converted into a DNA interstrand crosslink (ICL) between
guanine and cytosine [10]. ICLs are powerful blockers of
transcription and replication, resulting in cell death. FM
is used as a second line therapeutic in melanoma therapy
[11], notably for the treatment of brain metastases [12, 13].
The DNA lesions O6MeG and O6ClEtG are repaired
6
by O -methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT)
in a single step reaction that inactivates MGMT [14,
15]. The amount of MGMT in the tumor is therefore a
key node in alkylating drug resistance [16, 17]. Since
melanomas express low amounts of MGMT [16, 17]
they are expected to respond to alkylating agent based
therapy, which is likely the reason why DTIC, TMZ and
FM have been approved for therapy. Despite low MGMT
levels in melanoma, the response rate with these genotoxic
anticancer drugs remains low and the therapeutic outcome
poor [18]. This could be due to silencing of downstream
cell death pathways [19, 20] or due to acquired resistance
as a result of increased MGMT expression or increased
interstrand crosslink repair capacity [21, 22].
A breakthrough in melanoma therapy was
provided by the discovery that up to 66% of malignant
melanomas are mutated in BRAF [23]. The majority of
these mutations, around 80%, lead to a change of valine
to glutamic acid at codon 600, rendering the kinase
constitutively active and permanently triggering the RasRaf-MAP kinase pathway that stimulates proliferation
[23]. Specific inhibitors of mutated B-Raf have been
developed which target BRAFV600E cells. One of these
is vemurafenib (PLX4032) [24], which is beneficial for
melanoma patients exhibiting the BRAFV600E mutation
[25]. The response rate of these patients is about 50%
with significant tumor regression [25]. However, in most
cases the initial phase of tumor regression is followed
by therapy inefficiency and tumor progression leading
finally to the death of patients [26]. The disease relapse
indicates fast development of vemurafenib resistance in a
subset of tumor cells that leads to their outgrowth despite
continuous B-Raf inhibitor treatment.
In view of the inefficiency of genotoxic drug
and B-Raf inhibitor therapy, the question arises as
to combination strategies, either as concomitant or
sequential treatment. In vitro data regarding the response
of melanoma cells to TMZ or FM plus vemurafenib are
not available. This prompted us to study both drugs in
combination. We specifically addressed the following
questions. a) Does simultaneous treatment of melanoma
cells with vemurafenib and TMZ or FM provoke
synergistic cell kill? b) Does chronic treatment with
vemurafenib cause vemurafenib resistance in vitro and
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

is this accompanied by a change in MGMT activity? c)
Are vemurafenib resistant BRAFV600E melanoma cells
still responsive to TMZ or FM? d) Does vemurafenib
treatment change the MGMT promoter methylation
status of melanoma tumors in vivo? Our data did not
reveal a synergistic effect for both drugs, but encourage
a sequential application as vemurafenib resistant cells did
not display a change in the MGMT status and retained the
killing response towards TMZ and FM.

RESULTS
BRAFV600E is not predictive for the killing response
of melanoma lines to TMZ or FM
In an effort to determine whether the B-Raf inhibitor
vemurafenib may have a beneficial or detrimental
effect on melanoma cells treated with the genotoxic
chemotherapeutics TMZ and FM, a panel of melanoma
cell lines was experimentally examined. A375, Malme3M, A2058 and RPMI7951, all containing BRAFV600E [27,
28], and SK-Mel537, SK-Mel505, RPMI18332 and SKMel187, wild-type for BRAF [29, 30], were exposed to 1
and 5 µM vemurafenib. The lines containing BRAFV600E
showed a significant increase in apoptosis following
vemurafenib compared to the untreated controls (Fig.
1A) while the wild-type lines did not respond to the drug
(Fig. 1B). Exposing the same panel of cell lines to either
25 µM TMZ or 25 µM FM caused a different spectrum
of responses, independent of BRAFV600E mutation. The
methylating agent TMZ induced significant levels of
apoptosis in A375, Malme-3M, A2058, RPMI7951,
SK-Mel505, RPMI18332 and SK-Mel187 compared
to the untreated controls (Fig. 1C and 1D). TMZ also
caused significant increases in necrosis (defined by PI
staining) in A375, A2058, RPMI7951, SK-Mel505,
RPMI18332 and SK-Mel187 compared to the untreated
controls (Fig. 1C and 1D). The chloroethylating agent FM
induced significant levels of apoptosis in A375, A2058,
RPMI7951, SK-Mel505, RPMI18332 and SK-Mel187
compared to the untreated controls while also causing
significant increases in necrosis (PI positive) in the cell
lines A2058, RPMI7951, SK-Mel505, RPMI18332 and
SK-Mel187 compared to the untreated controls (Fig. 1C
and 1D). Overall, the response of the lines to TMZ and
FM was unrelated to BRAFV600E. For most cell lines the
apoptotic response was clearly more pronounced than the
necrotic response. We should also note that the level of
necrosis did not parallel apoptosis, reflecting the view
that separate pathways are involved. Summarizing the
results, it becomes apparent that BRAFV600E predicts the
response of melanoma cells to vemurafenib (tested with
a concentration of 1 and 5 µM) as BRAFV600E cells were
significantly more sensitive than the wild-type, while

BRAFV600E did not predict the response to TMZ and
FM (Fig. 1E). From these data it can be concluded that
vemurafenib, TMZ and FM primarily trigger the induction
of apoptotic cell death and that BRAFV600E does not impact
on the TMZ and FM killing response of melanoma cells.

would be beneficial, the panel of melanoma cell lines was
treated with 25 µM TMZ or 25 µM FM and one hour later
with 1 or 5 µM vemurafenib. Vemurafenib in combination
with TMZ induced apoptosis significantly in A375,
Malme-3M, A2058, RPMI7951, SK-Mel505, RPMI18332,
and SK-Mel187 compared to untreated controls while also
significantly increasing the necrosis/late-apoptosis levels
in A375, A2058, RPMI7951, SK-Mel505, RPMI18332
and SK-Mel187 compared to untreated controls (Fig. 2A
and 2B). Vemurafenib in combination with FM induced
significant levels of apoptosis in A375, Malme-3M,
A2058, RPMI7951, SK-Mel537, SK-Mel505, RPMI18332
and SK-Mel187 compared to untreated controls while

also significantly inducing necrosis/late-apoptosis in
A375, A2058, RPMI7951, SK-Mel505, RPMI18332
and SK-Mel187 compared to untreated controls (Fig.
2A and 2B). Similar with what was observed with the
single drug treatments, vemurafenib, TMZ and FM, the
dominant cell death pathway induced in the majority of
the cell lines was apoptosis. Although these data show
that combining these two chemotherapeutics causes only
a slight, but insignificant, increase in cell death compared
to single treatments, all, except for one, responded to the
combination treatment. The exception was SK-Mel537
treated with vemurafenib and TMZ. Summarizing the data,
it becomes clear that alkylating agents neither prevent
vemurafenib from exerting its killing effect nor does
vemurafenib impact on killing induced by the alkylating
agents as vemurafenib in combination with TMZ or FM
showed significantly more cell kill in BRAFV600E cells
than in the wild-type lines (Fig. 2C). It can be concluded
that melanoma cells respond to combination treatment,
irrespective of the BRAFV600E status.

in all the cell lines (Fig. 3G and 3H). Similar to the
apoptosis data presented in Fig. 2, a slight increase in
inhibition of proliferation was observed when applying
the chemotherapeutics in combination compared to single
treatment. This increase, however, was not significant.

Inhibition of B-Raf (V600E) by vemurafenib
does not impede or promote the proliferation
inhibitory properties of TMZ or FM
Having determined that vemurafenib, TMZ and FM
trigger cell death in melanoma cells and that combinations
of vemurafenib with TMZ or FM do not impede the
killing effects of the individual drugs, we expanded our
examination to the influence that these treatment schedules
have on the proliferation capacity of melanoma cell lines.
Using the carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester
(CFSE) proliferation assay, the cell division rate following
chemotherapeutic treatment was determined. In Fig. 3A
and 3B representative flow cytometry histograms are
presented for A375 (BRAFV600E) and SK-Mel505 (BRAF
wild-type) cells, respectively. Interestingly, both groups
of melanoma cell lines, those containing BRAFV600E and
those wild-type for BRAF, showed significant inhibition of
cell division following vemurafenib treatment compared
to controls (Fig. 3C and 3D), although the inhibitory
effect was most pronounced in the BRAFV600E lines. The
inhibition of proliferation observed in the wild-type cell
lines (Fig. 3D) following vemurafenib was only observed
at high concentration and did not lead to the induction of
cell death (Fig. 1B). Treatment with either TMZ or FM
caused inhibition of proliferation in the majority of the
cell lines, independent of the BRAFV600E status (Fig. 3E
and 3F). The exceptions being SK-Mel537 treated with
TMZ and SK-Mel187 treated with both TMZ and FM.
In general, FM was more effective at inhibiting cellular
proliferation than TMZ at equimolar concentrations,
which could be due to the ICLs induced by FM being a
more effective inhibitor of proliferation. The combination
treatments showed significant inhibition of proliferation

Next, we compared the lines in the combination treatment
schedule. The results displayed in Fig. 3G and 3H support
the conclusions drawn from the apoptosis data (Fig. 2A
and 2B). When combining vemurafenib with the genotoxic
drugs, a higher fraction of melanoma cell lines showed a
response compared to single treatments.

dependent increase in cell death following TMZ (Fig.
4A). Co-treatment with vemurafenib and the lowest TMZ
dose (10 µM), which was on its own nearly ineffective,
significantly stimulated cell death. At higher dose levels
this increase was not significant. There was a tendency
of increased cell death in the t72 treatment schedule,
when vemurafenib was added sequentially, i.e. 3 days
after TMZ, which is basically in line with the supposition
outlined above. There was also no significant difference
between A375 cells treated with vemurafenib at t0 or t72
in combination with FM, although vemurafenib at t72 in
combination with FM was more effective in eliciting cell
death than vemurafenib at t0 as adding vemurafenib at t72
showed a significant increase while adding vemuravenib
at t0 did not (Fig. 4A). In BRAF wild-type SK-Mel537
cells, TMZ was less effective, inducing significant levels
of apoptosis only at the highest concentration used (100
µM) (Fig. 4B). Neither adding vemurafenib at t0 nor at
t72 had any effect on TMZ-induced death. Following
treatment with FM and vemurafenib, both t0 and t72

Effect of differential scheduling of treatment with
vemurafenib and TMZ or FM
TMZ and FM require S-phase progression in order
to exert cell death at clinically relevant concentrations
[31-33]. As vemurafenib slows down proliferation (Fig.
3C and 3D), we hypothesized that adding vemurafenib
simultaneously with TMZ or FM would be less effective
than a sequential treatment strategy. Therefore, A375
(BRAFV600E) and SK-Mel537 (wild-type) cells were
exposed to increasing concentrations of TMZ in the
presence or absence of vemurafenib, added either 1h
(t0) or 72h after TMZ (t72). A375 cells showed a dose

TMZ and FM (t0) or 72h after TMZ and FM (t72) addition. Apoptosis and necrosis/late-apoptosis was determined 120 h after TMZ or
FM addition. Presented values are the sum of the apoptotic and the necrotic/late-apoptotic results. Presented data are from at least three

showed significant increases compared to FM alone
(Fig. 4B). The results show that TMZ with vemurafenib
applied simultaneously would most likely not improve
the response while differential scheduling might be of
some benefit for enhancing cell death following FM in
combination with vemurafenib.

exhibit cross-resistance to alkylating agents, a cell line
that carries BRAFV600E (A375) was chronically exposed
to vemurafenib (5 µM) for two months and the resulting
resistant cell line (iA375R) was tested for cross-resistance
to TMZ and FM. Vemurafenib induced significantly higher
levels of apoptosis throughout the concentration range
used (5-20 µM) in A375 cells compared to iA375R (Fig.
5A), demonstrating that iA375R acquired a vemurafenib
resistant phenotype. Melanoma cells are protected from
TMZ and FM induced apoptosis by the DNA repair
protein MGMT [7], while the MMR proteins MSH2,
MSH6, PMS2 and MLH1 convert the TMZ-induced
O6MeG lesion into a cytotoxic DSB [7]. Therefore the
protein levels of MGMT, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2 and

MLH1 were determined in A375 and iA375R cells as
any changes in these DNA repair proteins during the
acquisition of resistance to vemurafenib may have an
influence on cell death following TMZ. As shown in Fig.
5B, the expression of MGMT, MSH2, MSH6, MLH1 and
PMS2 in the parental and vemurafenib resistant cell lines
were comparable.
Since MGMT is the key factor of alkylation drug
resistance, we explored its expression more thoroughly.
We observed that vemurafenib caused a slight, but
significant decrease in MGMT protein (Fig. 5C) and
enzyme activity (Fig. 5D) in A375 cells, while iA375R
cells did not show this decrease (Fig. 5C and 5D).
Next, the question of whether acquired resistance to
vemurafenib-induced apoptosis would lead to crossresistance to TMZ or FM was addressed. No significant

differences were observed in TMZ (Fig. 5E) or FM (Fig.
5F) induced apoptosis in A375 cells compared to iA375R
cells, showing that acquired vemurafenib resistance does
not lead to cross-resistance towards TMZ or FM.

Vemurafenib therapy does not change the MGMT
status of tumors in vivo
As MGMT plays such an important role in the
resistance of cells and tumors to alkylating agents and
a small, but significant, change in MGMT activity was
observed following in vitro treatment of BRAFV600E
cells with vemurafenib (Fig. 5D), the promoter
methylation status of the MGMT gene was determined
in paired samples obtained from patients before and after

vemurafenib therapy. Fibroblasts were used as a negative
control and the glioma cell line LN229 that contains a
methylated promoter served as positive control. These
data revealed that tumors in situ displayed unmethylated
MGMT before and after vemurafenib treatment (Fig. 6A),
indicating that vemurafenib therapy had no impact on the
MGMT promoter methylation status of melanoma.
To support the MSP data, the MGMT promoter
methylation status of these tumors was also determined
by MS-HRM analysis. Similar to what was found for the
MSP assay, the methylation status of the MGMT promoter
did not change during therapy with vemurafenib as the
pre-treatment tumors and the post-treatment tumors all
showed unmethylated promoters (Fig. 6B). Next, the
MGMT protein expression was determined in untreated
and vemurafenib treated tumors using IHC. Both the
untreated and the vemurafenib treated tumors stained
positive for MGMT (Fig. 6C). Interestingly, the posttreatment tumors showed more staining for nuclear
localized MMR proteins MSH2, MSH6 and PMS2 than
the untreated tumor (Fig. 6C), which can be taken to
indicate enhancement of MMR capacity of vemurafenib
treated tumors. Collectively, regarding MGMT, it can be
concluded from the data that vemurafenib does not cause a
change in the MGMT promoter methylation status.

the response of melanomas to alkylating agents. We should
note that at the used concentration of TMZ and FM, the
clinical relevant DNA lesions O6MeG and O6ClEtG are
responsible for triggering apoptosis in melanoma cells
[7]. For this reason we performed all experiments by
inhibiting the repair enzyme MGMT prior to TMZ or
FM treatment, having a firm basis for comparing the O6alkylguanine response in the cell lines. The concentration
of O6BG added was sufficient to inactivate MGMT for the
duration of the experiments. Combining vemurafenib with
TMZ or FM did not clearly reduce the killing properties
of the chemotherapeutics. This is a pivotal finding
because it shows that not only does vemurafenib and the
alkylating agents exert their killing effects via independent
pathways, but that there is no mechanistic reason why
these therapeutics should not be combined during therapy.
This may be of benefit in a heterogeneous tumor, or in
the 19% of patients that carry both BRAFV600E and wildtype tumors [37], where combination therapy could
lead to better control. Of interest, vemurafenib caused
a slowdown in replication rate in both BRAFV600E and
wild-type cells. In wild-type, however, this only occurred
at higher concentrations, which is consistent with the
specificity of the B-Raf inhibitor [24]. Alkylating agents
in combination with vemurafenib lead to an even more
pronounced slowdown in replication rate, lending support
for the use of combinational therapy.
Addressing the question of cross-resistance, we
generated vemurafenib resistant BRAFV600E cells by chronic
exposure of melanoma cells to the serine/threonine-protein
kinase B-Raf inhibitor vemurafenib. These cells did not
show a change in the key resistant marker MGMT [14]
on protein or activity level. Therefore, we conclude
that chronic vemurafenib treatment has no impact on
MGMT, which is supported by our data obtained with
tumor specimens. Interestingly, treating the BRAFV600E
cell line with a single dose of vemurafenib, a transient
down-regulation of MGMT on protein and activity level
was observed. This might be a result of transient growth
changes that impact MGMT promoter activity. Cells,
however, still expressed MGMT. Under these conditions
N-alkylation lesions trigger cell death, which require
high dose treatment with alkylating agents that are
presumably clinically not relevant. As outlined above, in
this experimental setting the response of melanoma cells
depleted in MGMT was assessed in order to elucidate
the influence of vemurafenib on the O6-alkylguanine
response. To this end, we inhibited MGMT by O6BG.
Although MGMT inhibitors are not routinely applied
in melanoma therapy, the conclusions can be translated
to the therapeutic situation as TMZ/DTIC is being used
daily, which is supposed to cause a depletion of MGMT in
tumor cells and MGMT in melanoma has been shown to
be predictive of outcome [38].
We show that once MGMT was inhibited the
parental and vemurafenib resistant cells displayed a similar

DISCUSSION
The gold standard in the chemotherapy of metastatic
malignant melanoma is DTIC or TMZ. Despite this
genotoxic therapy, the disease has a dismal prognosis.
The finding that 40 to 60% of malignant melanomas
are mutated in BRAF [23, 34] paved the way for
searching for specific small molecule inhibitors. One
of these is vemurafenib [24], which causes significant
tumor regression in metastasized BRAFV600E mutated
melanoma patients [25]. Since tumor regression is only
transient in most cases, followed by acquired drug
resistance and tumor progression [26], the search for
alternative therapeutic strategies is warranted. It would be
reasonable to consider the idea of combining vemurafenib
with the classical anticancer drugs such as TMZ, a
representative methylating agent, and FM, a representative
chloroethylating nitrosourea, applied for melanoma
treatment [35]. Therefore, in this study, we addressed
how vemurafenib influences the response of melanoma to
alkylating agents.
The data show that BRAFV600E sensitizes melanoma
cells to vemurafenib-triggered apoptosis compared to
wild-type cells. This is most likely due to the phenomenon
of oncogene addiction [36]: as soon as mutant B-Raf
(V600E) is inhibited cells initiate apoptosis. Contrary
to the results obtained with vemurafenib, no systematic
and significant differences were observed in the apoptosis
levels triggered by TMZ or FM in BRAFV600E versus wildtype cells, showing that BRAFV600E status does not influence

killing response following treatment with FM and TMZ.
This indicates that there was no cross-resistance between
vemurafenib blocking the B-Raf pathway and O6MeG
and O6ClEtG triggered signaling leading to cell death
following TMZ and FM, respectively. The above discussed
results suggest that combinational treatment of melanoma
with vemurafenib and alkylating agents may be beneficial
and that switching to alkylating agent based therapy once
tumors has acquired resistance to vemurafenib is feasible
and might be of therapeutic benefit.
The expression of MGMT in melanomas is
controlled by the methylation status of CpG islands in its
promoter [38]. Therefore, the influence of vemurafenib
therapy on the silencing of MGMT in melanomas was
investigated by determining the promoter methylation
status in tumor specimens. Here we show that
vemurafenib did not alter MGMT promoter methylation
as pre-vemurafenib and post-vemurafenib treated cancers
all contained unmethylated promoters, showing that
vemurafenib is not active in suppressing the transcriptional
expression of MGMT. This was confirmed by IHC; no
discernable differences in the MGMT protein levels in preand post-treatment tumors were observed. Interestingly,
post-treatment tumors showed more pronounced nuclear
staining for the MMR proteins MSH2, MSH6 and PMS2.
MMR is required for processing the TMZ-induced O6MeG
DNA lesion into a killing lesion, namely DSBs. Increased
levels of these proteins in post-treatment tumors may
therefore imply that following vemurafenib switching to
TMZ therapy may even be beneficial.
Collectively, we report that the alkylating agents
TMZ and FM do not act synergistically with vemurafenib
in melanoma cells. Combination treatment with TMZ or
FM with vemurafenib did not attenuate the cell killing
properties of the individual chemotherapeutics, rather
additivity was observed. Further, acquired resistance to
vemurafenib of melanoma cells does not lead to crossresistance to TMZ and FM. Vemurafenib caused a slight
decrease in MGMT protein and activity in pulse-treated
cells in vitro while not influencing the MGMT promoter
methylation status in tumors following therapy. The lack
of cross-resistance, along with the increased MMR protein
expression observed in melanomas in situ, lend support for
the concept of switching to TMZ, dacarbazine or FM once
tumors acquire resistance to vemurafenib.

A2058, RPMI7951 and SK-Mel187 were cultivated in
DMEM while SK-Mel537, SK-Mel505 and RPMI18332
were cultivated in RPMI-1640. For Malme-3M the
medium was supplemented with 20% fetal calf serum
(FCS) while 10% FCS was used for the rest. In all
cases, 100U/mL penicillin and 100mg/mL streptomycin
were present and cells were cultivated at 5% CO2, 37oC
in a humidified atmosphere. All cell lines were verified
mycoplasma negative before experimental use. A375
and Malme-3M were obtained from the American Type
Culture Collection, RPMI7951 from the German Cell
Culture Depository while A2058, SK-Mel537, SKMel505, RPMI18332 and SK-Mel187 were a generous
gift from Dr. William K. Kaufmann (Dept. of Pathology
& Laboratory Medicine, University of North Carolina at
Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, USA). All the lines were
carefully characterized in the laboratory they originated
from, displayed the expected phenotype, but were not
reauthenticated in our laboratory.

Drugs and drug treatment
Vemurafenib (PLX4032, Selleckchem, Absource
Diagnostics GmbH, Munich, Germany) was dissolved
in DMSO to a final stock concentration of 10 mM.
Temozolomide (TMZ, Schering-Plough, Kenilworth, NJ,
USA) stock solutions with a final concentration of 35 mM
were prepared by dissolving the drug in DMSO and then
diluting it in an additional two parts dH2O. Vemurafenib
and TMZ stocks were stored at -80oC. Fotemustine (FM,
Muphoran, Servier Research International, Neuilly sur
Seine, France) was prepared fresh for each treatment
at a stock concentration of 10 mg/ml in EtOH. O6benzylguanine (O6BG) stock was prepared by dissolving
it in DMSO to a final concentration of 10 mM. O6BG was
always added to the cells 1h before TMZ or FM treatment
to deplete MGMT, unless stated otherwise. For the
combination treatments, O6BG was added to the medium,
1h later TMZ or FM was added and then an additional
hour later (t0), or 72h later (t72), vemurafenib was added.
For all apoptosis and growth inhibition experiments,
samples were harvested 120 h after TMZ of FM addition
and assayed for the response.

Measurement of apoptosis by flow cytometry

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Annexin V/propidium iodide double-staining of
unfixed cells was used to distinguish between early
apoptotic cells and late-apoptotic/necrotic cells as
described [19]. Annexin V positive cells were classified
as apoptotic while double-positive cells were classified as
necrotic/late-apoptotic. The flow cytometric analysis was
carried out using a FACS Canto II flow cytometer (Becton
Dickinson GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany). The data were
analyzed using the BD FACSDiva software.

Cell lines and cell culture
The BRAFV600E A375, Malme-3M, A2058 and
RPMI7951 [27, 28] and wild-type SK-Mel537, SKMel505, RPMI18332 and SK-Mel187 [29, 30] melanoma
cell lines were used in this study. A375, Malme-3M,

Cellular proliferation assay

(Freiburg, Germany). Methylation-specific PCR (MSP)
for the promoter of MGMT was performed as described
[42]. The following primer sequences were used (5’-3’):
Meth-up TTT CGA CGT TCG TAG GTT TTC GC, Methlow GCA CTC TTC CGA AAA CGA AAC G, Unmeth-up
TTT GTG TTT TGA TGT TTG TAG GTT TTT GT and
Unmeth-low AAC TCC ACA CTC TTC CAA AAA CAA
AAC A [43].

The cellular division rate was determined using
carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFSE)
stained cells [39]. One day after labeling the control
sample (0h) was harvested and analyzed by flow cytometry
(FACS Canto II). On this day cells were treated or not
with vemurafenib, TMZ, FM or combinations of the drugs,
and 120h later samples were harvested and subjected to
flow cytometry analysis. Using the mean 0h fluorescence
signal, a standard curve was plotted to determine the
number of cell divisions after 120h incubation in treated
and untreated cells.

Methylation specific high resolution melting curve
(MS-HRM) analysis
The relative amount of CpG sites methylated in the
MGMT promoter was determined by MS-HRM. Fully
methylated and unmethylated DNA for the methylation
standard was prepared from a Buccal swab of a healthy
donor as described [44]. Tumor DNA, obtained as
described in MSP section, and methylation standard DNA
were bisulfite modified using the EZ DNA Methylation Kit
from Zymo Research (Freiburg, Germany). Methylation
independent primers for the MGMT promoter was used
that included no CpG sites. Primers were designed using
the Pyromark assay Designer 2.0 (Qiagen) that flank the
binding sites of the MSP primers [43]. The following
primer sequences were used (5’-3’): Up GGA TAT GTT
GGG ATA GTT and low CCC AAA CAC TCA CCA AAT.
Following PCR amplification and melting point analysis,
performed by stepwise increase of temperature by 0.2 oC,
the normalized Precision Melt Analysis Software (BioRad)
output were exported to GraphPad Prism. The area under
the curve was calculated for all the samples, DNA standard
and tumor, and the quadratic least square regression was
used to interpolate the unknown samples to the standards.
R² was >0.97 (for linear regression R²>0.93).

Preparation of protein extracts
Whole cell protein extracts were prepared as
described [7]. Protein concentrations were determined
using the Bradford method [40].

Immunoblotting
Western blot analysis was performed as described
[7]. Proteins were detected by the Odyssey 9120 Infrared
Imaging System (Li-Cor Biosciences, Lincoln, Nebraska,
USA). The antibodies used were anti-MGMT (Merck
Millipore, Billerica, Massachusetts, USA), anti-HSP90,
anti-beta-actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Heidelberg,
Germany), anti-MSH2 (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA,
USA), anti-MSH6 (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington,
KY, USA) and anti-MLH1 (BD Pharmingen, Heidelberg,
Germany).

Determination of MGMT activity

Tumor biopsies and immunohistochemistry

MGMT activity assay was performed as described
[41]. HeLa S3 cells expressing MGMT (588±86 fmol/mg
protein) and HeLa MR cells deficient in MGMT served as
positive and negative controls. Data are expressed as fmol
radioactivity transferred from 3H-labelled DNA to protein/
mg of protein within the sample.

Samples of malignant melanoma were obtained from
patients following surgery. Patient material was obtained
with informed consent and approval from the institutional
ethics committee of the University Medical Center Mainz.
Slices were obtained from paraffinised sections, which
were labeled as to the tumor area. Immunohistochemical
analysis of MGMT, MSH2, MSH6 and PMS2 levels in
untreated and post-treatment melanoma samples were
performed as described [45]. Antibodies used were
anti-MGMT (clone MT3.1), anti-MSH2 (clone FE11,
Merck Millipore, Billerica, Massachusetts, USA), antiMSH6 ([44]) and anti-PMS2 ([EPR3947], Abcam Inc.,
Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA). Following incubation
with the appropriate 2nd anti-body nuclei were stained
with TO-PRO-3. Microphotographs were acquired
by laser scanning microscopy (LSM710, Carl Zeiss
MicroImaging).

Preparation of genomic DNA and methylationspecific PCR (MSP)
Paraffinized tumor samples were cut into 10 µm
thick slices and immobilized on glass slides. One of the
specimens (with 3 µm thickness) was hematoxylin stained,
evaluated and the tumor area was labeled. The tumor
tissue was carefully removed from 3 slides (with 10 µM
thickness), genomic DNA was extracted by the standard
protocol using phenol-chloroform and DNA was modified
using the EZ DNA Methylation Kit from Zymo Research
