ABSTRACT
Purpose: To assess the efficacy of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NCT) plus
targeted agents versus NCT alone for the treatment of colorectal liver metastases
(CRLM) patients.
Methods: Trials published between 1994 and 2015 were identified by an electronic
search of public databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane library). All clinical studies
were independently identified by two authors for inclusion. Demographic data,
treatment regimens, objective response rate (ORR), hepatic resection and R0 hepatic
resection rate were extracted and analyzed using Comprehensive MetaAnalysis
software (Version 2.0).
Results: A total of 40 cohorts with 2099 CRLM patients were included: 962 patients
were treated with NCT alone, 602 with NCT plus anti-epidermal growth-factor receptor
(EGFR)-monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) and 535 with NCT plus bevacizumab. Pooled
ORR was significantly higher for NCT plus bevacizumab or anti-EGFR-MoAbs than
NCT alone [relative risk (RR) 1.53, 95% CI 1.30–1.80; p < 0.001; RR 1.53, 95%
CI: 1.27–1.83, p < 0.001; respectively]. NCT plus bevacizumab significantly improved
R0 hepatic resection rate (RR 1.61, 95% CI: 1.27–2.04, p < 0.001), but not for overall
hepatic resection rate (RR 1.26, 95% CI: 0.81–1.94, p = 0.30). While hepatic resection
and R0 hepatic resection rate was comparable between NCT plus anti-EGFR-MoAbs
and NCT alone (p = 0.42 and p = 0.37, respectively).
Conclusions: In comparison with NCT alone, NCT plus bevacizumab significantly
improve ORR and R0 hepatic resection rate but not for hepatic resection rate. Our
findings support the need to compare NCT plus bevacizumab with NCT alone in the
neoadjuvant setting in large prospective trials due to its higher hepatic resection rate
and R0 hepatic resection rate in CRLM patients.

colorectal liver metastases is a potentially curative option,
with reported 5-year survival of 28–39% [3–5] and 10-year
overall survival of over 20% [4, 6]. However, unfortunately,
70–80% of patients will relapse in two years after liver
surgery, and about 80% of patients with colorectal liver
metastases have unresectable disease at presentation [7].
To improve the prognosis of CRLM patients, it
is important to improve the liver metastasis treatment
outcomes. Over the past decade, the introduction of
irinotecan- or oxaliplatin-based combination chemotherapy

INTRODUCTION
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common
malignant tumors throughout the world with over
1.2 million new cases and 608700 deaths estimated to occur
annually [1]. The liver is the most common site of colorectal
cancer metastasis. Nearly half of CRC patients will develop
colorectal liver metastases (CRLM) during the course of
their disease, with 15% of patients having liver metastatic
lesions at the time of diagnosis [2]. Surgical resection of

have resulted in significant improvements in objective
response rates and ultimately in overall survival of
unselected patients with metastatic colorectal cancer
[8–10]. In recent years, neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NCT)
has been increasingly used in the management of liverconfined metastases from CRC. For patients with initially
resectable disease, the use of NCT in CRLM might increase
the complete resection rate and treat the micro-metastatic
disease [3, 11]. When treating unresectable liver metastases
of colorectal cancer, “conversion therapy” has been
applied to reduce the tumor size and facilitate resection via
preoperative chemotherapy [12, 13]. In addition, NCT can
be used as a test of in vivo chemosensitivity, and patients
with extremely aggressive disease, who will progress during
preoperative chemotherapy, can be spared useless surgery.
As a result, neoadjuvant chemotherapy combined surgery
for liver metastasis is regarded as an effective strategy in
CRLM patients.
During the past decade, the understanding of the
molecular pathways that involved in tumor growth and
metastasis has significantly increased and with this has
come the development of several molecular targeted
therapies [9, 14–16]. Two options are currently available
in routine clinical practice for CRLM patients: Epidermal
growth factor receptors (EGFRs) antibodies and vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF) antibodies. The efficacy
of these molecular targeted agents in the treatment

of unselected metastatic CRC has been extensively
investigated, but whether the addition of molecular targeted
agents to NCT in CRLM patients would improve response
rate and hepatic resection rate remains unclear. A recent
meta-analysis conducted by Qi et al [17] showed that
the addition of targeted agents to first-line chemotherapy
for unselected advanced colorectal cancer significantly
improved the complete response when compared with
controls. However, it is still unknown whether this benefit
in response rate would translate into an improvement
in hepatic resection rate and R0 hepatic resection rate
for CRML patients. We thus conduct this meta-analysis
of published data to compare the efficacy of NCT plus
targeted agents verse NCT alone in CRLM patients.

RESULTS
Search results
A total of 543 studies were identified from the
database search, of which 54 reports were retrieved for
full-text evaluation. 40 cohorts from 32 trials [24–54] met
the inclusion criteria and were included in this systematic
review: (Figure 1). Table 1 showed the characteristics of
the included studies. Overall, 2099 CRLM patients were
included, with a median age of 62.0 years [95% confidence
interval (CI): 59.0–62.91] for the NCT alone group and

61.0 years (95% CI: 58.2–62.9) for the NCT plus targeted
agents group. We found two randomized controlled
trials comparing NCT plus cetuximab with NCT alone
in CRLM patients, but no randomized controlled trials
directly comparing NCT plus bevacizumab with NCT
alone in these settings. Methodological quality of the
included studies was fair; most studies provided adequate
outcome ascertainment, enrolled a representative sample
of patients, and had an acceptable length of follow-up
(Figure 2). However, comparative evidence was at high
risk of bias because we compared data across studies not
within them, and selection bias was likely to be present.
Assessment of publication bias was not done because data
would be unreliable in view of the few studies included for
each treatment group and high heterogeneity (I2 > 50%)
in most analyses.

bevacizumab and NCT plus anti-epidermal growth-factor
receptor (EGFR)-monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) were
66.2% and 66.2% respectively, which was higher than
that of NCT alone (43.4%, Figure 3). A higher incidence
of hepatic resection and R0 hepatic resection was
observed in NCT plus bevacizumab (68.4% and 49.2%
respectively) when compared to NCT plus anti-EGFRMoAbs or NCT alone. While comparable incidence of
hepatic resection and R0 hepatic resection was found
between NCT plus anti-EGFR-MoAbs and NCT alone
(Figures 4 and 5).

alone (Table 3). However, only one trial investigating
FOLFIRI plus bevacizumab in resectable CRLM patients
was included for analysis, thus further studies were still
needed to assess the efficacy of irinotecan-based NCT plus
targeted agents in CRLM patients. For CRLM patients
receiving oxaliplatin-based NCT, the addition of targeted
agents to oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy increased ORR
(65.1% versus 46.3%), but not for hepatic resection rate
and R0 hepatic resection rate (Table 3).

Sub-group analysis
Six included trials reported efficacy data about antiEGFR-MoAbs according to K-ras status in CRLM patients.
The pooled ORR, hepatic resection and R0 hepatic
resection rate for CRLM with K-ras wild-type receiving
EGFR-MoAbs were 64.6% (95% CI: 59.8–69.0%), 56.7%
(95% CI: 33.7–77.2%), and 30.0% (95% CI: 24.2–36.4%),
respectively. Then, we performed sub-groups analysis
according to respectability status. For initially resectable
CRLM patients, the addition of targeted agents to NCT
did not significantly improve hepatic resection rate (88.9%
versus 82.5%) and R0 hepatic resection rate (67.5% versus
69.7%), while the addition of targeted agents to NCT
increased ORR (65.0% versus 44.3%), hepatic resection
rate (54.8% versus 35.5%) and R0 hepatic resection
rate (38.0% versus 18.3%) in comparison to NCT alone
(Table 3). Additionally, we performed sub-groups analysis
based on combined chemotherapy. Irinotecan-based NCT
plus targeted agents seemed to improve hepatic resection
rate and R0 hepatic resection rate when compared to NCT

DISCUSSION
The liver is the common metastatic site for
colorectal cancer, and surgical resection is the only
therapeutic modality that offers the potential for longterm cure. Appropriate patient selection for surgery
and improvements in perioperative care has resulted
in low morbidity and mortality rates, meaning that
this is the therapy of choice in suitable patients. In
recent years, the survival of patients with metastatic
colorectal cancer has been improved, initially by the
use of oxaliplatin- or irinotecan-based combination
chemotherapy. Subsequently, it has been shown that the
efficacy of cytotoxic chemotherapy can be enhanced by the
addition of novel targeted agents, notably the anti-VEGF
monoclonal antibodies and the anti-EGFR antibodies.
However, the efficacy of targeted agents in neoadjuvant
chemotherapy for CRLM patients remains unknown.

Figure 3: Incidence of objective response rate according to neoadjuvant regimens.
Recently, two prospective randomized controlled trials
have been conducted to investigate the efficacy of NCT
plus cetuximab versus NCT alone in CRLM patients [33].
The trial conducted by Ye L.C et al showed that
cetuximab combined with chemotherapy improved the
resectability of liver metastases and improved response
rates (57.1% versus 29.4%) and 3-year survival (41%
versus 18%) in comparison with chemotherapy alone for
K-RAS wild-type CRLM patients [33], while the New
EPOC trial showed that the addition of cetuximab to
neoadjuvant chemotherapy for K-RAS wild-type CRLM
patients resulted in shorter progression-free survival
(HR 1.48, 95% CI: 1.04–2.12, p = 0.03) [29]. Therefore,
the role of cetuximab in neoadjuvant setting for CRLM
patients is not established. In addition, to the best of our
knowledge, there is lack of head-to-head comparison data
available for NCT plus bevacizumab versus NCT alone in
the treatment of CRLM patients. As a result, we conduct
this systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the
efficacy of NCT plus targeted agents versus NCT alone for
the treatment of CRLM patients.
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

A total of 2099 CRLM patients from 40 cohorts are
included for analysis. Based on our pooled results, we
find that NCT plus bevacizumab could employ a role in
the neoadjuvant setting for CRLM patients in particular
in terms of ORR and R0 hepatic resection rate, while
comparable efficacy is found between NCT plus EGFRMoAbs and NCT alone in terms of hepatic resection
rate and R0 hepatic resection rate. Additionally, several
retrospective studies have demonstrated that the addition
of bevacizumab to chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant and
conversion setting significantly improve pathological
response in CRLM patients, and patients with a good
pathological response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy are
associated with a better outcome [41, 55, 56]. Based on
these encouraging data, the combination of NCT plus
bevacizumab as neoadjuvant and conversion therapy could
be recommended for initially unresectable or resectable
CRLM patients due to its higher ORR and R0 hepatic
resection rate. However, more evidence is still required
before NCT plus bevacizumab could become the standard
peri-operative treatment for these patients.
44010

Figure 4: Incidence of hepatic resection rate according to neoadjuvant regimens.
We then perform sub-group analysis according to
patients’ characteristics. Our results find that the addition
of targeted agents to NCT seems more efficient for
initially unresectable patients than for initial resectable
patients in terms of hepatic resection rate and R0 hepatic
resection rate. It might be explained that the addition of
targeted agents to NCT could increase the efficacy of
neoadjuvant treatment in initially unresectable CRLM
patients, which might achieve maximum tumor shrinkage
to create an opportunity for hepatic resection. and it
has been reported that rate of early tumor shrinkage is
directly associated with the ability to operate and has
also been proven to be associated with long-term survival
[57]. The optimal chemotherapy regimen combined
with targeted agents as neoadjuvant therapy for CRLM
patients remains to be defined. We thus carry out a subgroup analysis stratified according to chemotherapy
regimens. Our results find that irinotecan-based NCT
plus targeted agents seems to improve hepatic resection
rate and R0 hepatic resection rate when compared
to NCT alone, while the addition of targeted agents
to oxaliplatin-based NCT does not improve hepatic
resection rate and R0 hepatic resection rate. A similar
result have been observed in a large prospective clinical
trials comparing FOLFOX versus FOLRIR as first-line
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

treatment for metastatic colorectal cancer [58]. In that
study of 220 unselected patients, FOLFIRI achieved a
significantly higher rate of secondary surgery to remove
metastases as compared to FOLFOX (22% vs. 9%;
P = 0.02), with a higher R0 rate (13% vs 7%), which
adding further validity to our findings. However, the
results of our sub-group analysis regarding concurrent
chemotherapy on efficacy of targeted agents are not
solid since only one trial investigating FOLFIRI plus
bevacizumab in resectable CRLM patients is included
for analysis, thus more studies are still needed to assess
the efficacy of irinotecan-based NCT plus targeted
agents in those patients. We also investigate the efficacy
of anti-EGFR-MoAbs in CRLM with K-ras wild-type.
And the pooled ORR, hepatic resection and R0 hepatic
resection rate for CRLM with K-ras wild-type is
comparable to those for CRLM patients with or without
K-ras wild-type. One possible explanation for this is that
although these studies include CRLM patients with or
without k-ras wild type, most of CRLM patients have
k-ras wild type. For example, 81% CRLM patients had
k-ras wild-type tumor in the trial conducted by Garufi C.
et al [46]. Another possible explanation for this finding
is that all RAS wild-type patients receiving anti-EGFR
agents have a better efficacy than for patients with only

KRAS exon 2 wild type, while patients in these previous
trials did not detect other new RAS status including
NRAS and exons 3 and 3 of KRAS, which might also
be negative predictive biomarkers for anti-EGFR
agents [57]. Moreover, we could not pool the results
about quality of life (QoL) due to none of included trial
reporting Qol results.
Several limitations exist in this analysis. First and
most importantly, the application of formal meta-analytic
methods to observational studies has been controversial
[59]. One of the most important reasons for this is that
the designs and populations of the studies are diverse, and
that these differences may influence the pooled estimates.
However, when no head-to-head comparison data
available for NCT plus bevacizumab versus NCT alone,
a meta-analysis of observational studies is one of the few
methods for assessing efficacy [60]. Second, the study is a
pooled analysis of primarily single arm prospective studies
and retrospective series, with a small number of patients
included that might have over-reported the benefit of
preoperative treatments. The inclusion criteria also likely
favor young, fit, and responder patients, a highly selected
group of subjects with good prognostic indicators. Thirdly,
this meta-analysis only considers published literature, and
lack of individual patient data prevents us from adjusting

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

the treatment effect according to disease and patient
variables. Finally, we could not pool the results about QoL
due to none of included trial reporting Qol results.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study design
We developed a protocol that defined inclusion
criteria, search strategy, outcomes of interest, and analysis
plan. The reporting of this systematic review adheres to
the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and
Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statements [18].

Identification and selection of studies
To identify studies for inclusion in our systematic
review and meta-analysis, we did a broad search of four
databases, including Embase, Medline, the Cochrane
Central Register of Controlled Trials, and the Cochrane
Database of Systematic Reviews, from the date of
inception of every database to August 2014. The search
included the following terms: ‘‘colorectal neoplasms’’,
‘‘colorectal
cancer’’,
‘‘colorectal
carcinoma’’,
‘‘cetuximab’’,
‘‘panitumumab’’,
“bevacizumab”,

To be eligible for inclusion in our systematic
review and meta-analysis, study populations (referred
to hereafter as cohorts) had to meet all the following
criteria: 1) patients with colorectal liver metastasis; 2)
treatment with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, NCT plus
approved molecular agents (cetuximab, bevacizumab,
panitumumab and aflibercept); 3) reported outcomes of
interest (ie, objective response rate, overall resection rate,
and R0 liver resection rate); and 4) from an original study
(ie, randomized controlled trial, non-randomized clinical
trial, observational studies, or case series).

event rates with DerSimonian and Laird random-effect
models or using the Mantel-Haenszel test according to
heterogeneity among included studies [21]. We used
the test of interaction proposed by Altman and Bland
to compare log-transformed rates of outcomes between
NCT and NCT plus targeted agents [22]. A statistical
test with a p-value less than 0.05 was considered
significant. To account for the potential effect of
publication bias, we used the Duval and Tweedie nonparametric trim-and-fill method [23]. To measure overall
heterogeneity across the included cohorts, we calculated
the I 2 statistic, with I 2 greater than 50% indicating high
heterogeneity. We assessed potential publication bias by
visual inspection of the symmetry of funnel plots and
with the Egger regression asymmetry test. We did all
statistical analyses with comprehensive meta-analysis
software version 2.0(Biostat, Englewood, NJ, USA).

Data extraction

CONCLUSIONS

Two investigators screened the titles and abstracts
of potentially relevant studies. We retrieved the full
text of relevant studies for further review by the same
two reviewers. A third senior investigator resolved any
discrepancies between reviewers. If reviewers suspected
an overlap of cohorts in a report, they contacted the
corresponding author for clarification; we excluded studies
with a clear overlap.
The same pair of reviewers extracted study
details independently, using a standardized pilot-tested
form. A third investigator reviewed all data entries.
We extracted the following data: author, study design,
study period, median age, interventions (neoadjuvant
chemotherapy regimens and dose), sample size and
outcomes of interest. We defined outcomes of interest
as overall resection rate, R0 liver resection rate and
objective response rate (ORR). ORR was defined as the
sum of partial and complete response rates according to
the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [19].
To assess quality, since we included non-comparative
(uncontrolled) studies in our systematic review and
meta-analysis, we used the Newcastle-Ottawa quality
assessment scale [20]. We selected items that focused on
representativeness of study patients, demonstration that
the outcome of interest was not present at the start of the
study, adequate assessment of outcome, sufficient length
of follow-up to allow outcomes to arise, and adequacy
of follow-up.

Currently available clinical evidence indicates
that NCT plus bevacizumab may be a feasible regimen
for patients with CRLM in comparison with NCT alone.
However, since the overall quantity and quality of data
regarding NCT plus bevacizumab is poor and considering
the risk of bias in comparisons between observation
studies. The reported results do not allow for definite
conclusions. As a result, prospective randomized studies,
definitively comparing the survival and treatment toxicity
between NCT plus bevacizumab and NCT alone, are
strongly encouraged to clearly set the role of NCT plus
bevacizumab in the treatment of CRLM patients.
