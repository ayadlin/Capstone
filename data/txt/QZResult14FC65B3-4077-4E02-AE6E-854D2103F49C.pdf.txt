ABSTRACT
Flavopiridol is a small molecule inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK) known
to impair global transcription via inactivation of positive transcription elongation
factor b. It has been demonstrated to have significant activity predominantly in chronic
lymphocytic leukemia and acute myeloid leukemia in phase I/II clinical trials while
other similar CDK inhibitors are vigorously being pursued in pre-clinical and clinical
studies. Although flavopiridol is a potent therapeutic agent against blood diseases,
some patients still have primary or acquired resistance throughout their clinical
course. Considering the limited knowledge of resistance mechanisms of flavopiridol,
we investigated the potential mechanisms of resistance to flavopiridol in a cell line
system, which gradually acquired resistance to flavopiridol in vitro, and then confirmed
the mechanism in patient samples. Herein, we present that this resistant cell line
developed resistance through up-regulation of phosphorylation of RNA polymerase II
C-terminal domain, activation of CDK9 kinase activity, and prolonged Mcl-1 stability
to counter flavopiridol’s drug actions. Further analyses suggest MAPK/ERK activationmediated Mcl-1 stabilization contributes to the resistance and knockdown of Mcl-1 in
part restores sensitivity to flavopiridol-induced cytotoxicity. Altogether, these findings
demonstrate that CDK9 is the most relevant target of flavopiridol and provide avenues
to improve the therapeutic strategies in blood malignancies.

INTRODUCTION

will eventually relapse and further therapy options are
limited. [1, 2] The heterogeneity of CLL can be partly
accounted for the high frequency of chromosomal
abnormalities which have been identified in ~80% CLL
cases by fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH). [3, 4]
The common recurrent karyotypic abnormalities include
del(17p13.1), del(11q22.3), trisomy 12, del(13q14), and
(del6q.21) and have been established in a hierarchical

Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is the
most common adult leukemia in the western world and
considered incurable. CLL has been characterized as a
clonal B-cell disorder attributed to its defective apoptosis
and sustained nurture of the tumor microenvironment.
It is a progressive disease and has a very heterogeneous
clinical course with survival time ranging from months
to decades. Patients are treated with the current frontline

and del(11q22.3) but advantagous survival for patients
with trisomy 12, normal karyotype, and del(13q14) as the
sole abnormality. [3, 5]
The lack of effective therapies for CLL has attracted
intensive research in the development of new therapeutic
approaches for this disease. A notable advancement in this
effort has been the introduction of cyclin-dependent kinase
(CDK) inhibitors. Flavopiridol is the first in class broad
CDK inhibitor effective in decreasing activity of CDK1,
CDK2, CDK6, and CDK7 and CDK9 that has entered
clinical trials. After considerable schedule optimization,
flavopiridol demonstrated clinical activity for CLL and
non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). [6-10] Although having
a narrow therapeutic window, it has been shown to be
effective in relapsed and refractory CLL patients with 40
– 50% response rates in patients with genetically highrisk disease. [9, 11-13] In vitro and in vivo studies by
our laboratory and others have shown that flavopiridol
mediates potent apoptosis in CLL cells that occurs
independent of del(17p13.1) or loss of p53 function.
[11, 12, 14] Further studies in CLL and other leukemias
suggest that flavopiridol mediates its cytotoxic effects
through inhibition of positive transcription elongation
factor b (P-TEFb, CDK9/cyclin T) via CDK9 and hence
hampering global RNA transcription. Other drug actions
of flavopiridol include depletion of anti-apoptotic proteins,
such as Bcl-2, Bcl-xL and Mcl-1, down-regulation of
X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) and
survivin, up-regulation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER)
stress response and induction of autophagy. [10, 14-17]
Long exposure of flavopiridol in lung and ovarian cell
lines has shown to induce DNA damage, suggesting
that flavopiridol may have other drug actions yet to be
identified. [18]
Because of encouraging results in leukemias and
NHL, development of flavopiridol continues both as a
single agent and in combination with other therapies in
clinical trials. Other CDK inhibitors with similar kinase
profiles to flavopiridol are also under development. [19]
Although flavopiridol shows good efficacy in CLL and
other hematologic malignancies, some patients do not
respond or eventually relapse. As with all other cancer
therapies, CDK inhibitors acquire resistance in clinic but
their resistant mechanisms are poorly described and not
well understood, in particular in the blood malignancies.
The mechanism underlying resistance to flavopiridol has
been associated with in vitro overexpression of the ATPbinding cassette half-transporter, ABCG2, in human breast
cancer cell lines, exhibiting resistance to flavopiridol;
however, it is not consistently observed in other
spontaneously developed flavopiridol-resistant cell lines,
such as ovarian carcinoma cells and colon carcinoma cells.
[20-22] Data from our group showed that combination of
flavopiridol and inactivation of autophagy either through
chloroquine or genetic knockdown, can induce remarkable
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

cellular cytotoxicity in CLL, suggesting autophagy as a
potential resistance mechanism for flavopiridol. [15]
To further explore this, we sought to generate
the resistant cell line (Flavo-R) to study the resistance
mechanism of flavopiridol and exploit this system for
better understanding of flavopiridol-targeted pathways.
In this study, we demonstrate that cells acquire resistance
via the increase of phosphorylation of Ser2 of RNA
polymerase II (RNA Pol II) and its upstream kinase
activity (CDK9), indicating that flavopiridol primarily
exerts its killing effect through inhibition of transcription.
Moreover, activation of the mitogen-activated protein
kinases MAPK/ERK is shown to contribute to upregulation of Mcl-1 levels in Flavo-R through Mcl-1
protein stabilization. Genetic knockdown of Mcl-1 by
shRNA in part restores the sensitivity to flavopiridol in
these resistant cells. Our investigation also determines
that flavopiridol modulates the transcriptional inhibition
not only by targeting CDK9 activity but also decreasing
its expression. Ineffective reduction of CDK9 protein
expression after flavopiridol therapy associates with poor
response to flavopiridol in vivo. Altogether, these findings
validate CDK9 as a favorable therapeutic target in CLL
and up-regulation of the CDK9-associated pathways,
including Mcl-1 and RNA transcription machinery
contributes to the resistance of flavopiridol.

RESULTS
Lymphoid cells acquire non-transporter mediated
resistance to flavopiridol
Data from our laboratory and others have shown that
drug actions of flavopiridol include down-regulation antiapoptotic proteins, inactivation of P-TEFb (CDK9/cyclin
T), and induction of ER stress response and autophagy
activity. [10, 14, 15, 23] Hence, to better understand the
resistance and drug mechanisms of flavopiridol to improve
clinical outcomes, we generated flavopiridol–resistant
(Flavo-R) cell lines from initially sensitive pre-B acute
lymphoblastic leukemia cell line, 697. Flavo-R is viable
with continuous exposure to flavopiridol at concentrations
of 500nM. Flavo-R cells are routinely monitored for
resistance to flavopiridol and were maintained in culture
without drug. Compared to parental cells, Flavo-R cells
exposed to 0.2μM or 0.3μM flavopiridol continuously
showed robust resistance to drug by a measure of the cell
viability via annexin V-FITC and PI-PE by flow cytometry
(Figure 1). These resistant cells develop the spontaneous
resistance specifically to flavopiridol but not other
therapeutics such as fludarabine (Supplemental Figure
1). Interestingly, Flavo-R developed the cross-resistance
to dinaciclib which is a more potent and selective CDK
inhibitor primarily targeting CDK1, 2, and 9 (IC50 of

proximal pathways (Figure 1). [24, 25]

Pro6–Ser7. Concomitant with initiation and throughout
the transcription cycle, the CTD becomes highly
phosphorylated at Ser2 and Ser5 positions particularly.
During transcription, CTD is initially phosphorylated on
Ser5 by the CDK7/cyclin H and as RNA Pol II elongates,
Ser2 is increasingly phosphorylated by CDK9/cyclin
T, while Ser5 phosphorylation is gradually reduced by
phosphatases. [27, 28] As flavopiridol was demonstrated
to decrease the phosphorylation status of RNA Pol II CTD
in primary CLL previously, phosphorylation of Ser2 and
Ser5 sites was investigated in parental and Flavo-R cells.
[10] Ser2 phosphorylation was greatly diminished upon
flavopiridol treatment in parental cells while it appeared

Flavopiridol has been shown to inhibit the
phosphorylation of the C-terminal domain (CTD) of

Figure 1: Cells acquired resistance to flavopiridol-induced cell death in vitro. 697 parental and flavopiridol-resistant (Flavo-R)

cells were treated with continuous flavopiridol (0.2μM or 0.3μM), or 1μM dinaciclib with 2-hour exposure and washout (w/o). Cell viability
was measured post 24 hours by annexin V-FITC and PI-PE stains, followed by flow cytometry. Flavo-R also develops cross-resistance to
dinaciclib with the significant survival advantage over parental cells at 24 hours post to dinaciclib treatment. Due to the similar effects of
continuous 0.2µM, 0.3µM flavopiridol, p-values represent the average effect for both doses.

Figure 2: Phosphorylation of Ser2 of RNA Pol II CTD is more resistant against flavopiridol’s drug action. 697 parental

and Flavo-R cells were treated with either 2μM flavopiridol with 4-hour exposure and washout (w/o), or 1μM dinaciclib with 2-hour
exposure and washout (w/o) and collected at various time points as indicated in the figure. Protein lysates were prepared and subjected to
immunoblotting for phosphorylation of Ser2 of RNA Pol II, total RNA Pol II and actin. Consistently, Flavo-R reveals more robust Ser2
phosphorylation with flavopiridol and dinaciclib, implicating higher activity of RNA Pol II. It also suggests that Flavo-R mechanistically
establishes the resistance to dinaciclib in vitro in concert with observations in cell cytotoxicity described in Figure 1. Densitometry was
applied to quantify the intensity of immunoreactive bands for phospho-Ser2 of RNA Pol II and, which was normalized to total RNA Pol II

to be less affected in Flavo-R in a time course (Figure 2).
After depletion of drug at 4-hour exposure of flavopiridol
and 2-hour exposure of dinaciclib, Ser2 phosphorylation
was quickly recovered in Flavo-R to promote
RNA transcriptional machinery. Similarly, Flavo-R
demonstrated sustained levels of Ser2 phosphorylation
with dinaciclib, suggesting that CDK9 is the most relevant
target of both therapies. Phosphorylation of the Ser5 site
in Flavo-R was retained with flavopiridol, albeit to a lesser
extent (Supplemental Figure 2). These data indicated
that up-regulation of phosphorylation on both Ser2 and
Ser5 of the CTD contributed to the observed resistant
mechanism in Flavo-R and promoting cell survival against
flavopiridol.

two isoforms in mammalian cells, CDK9-42 and CDK955 where CDK9-55 has 117 additional amino acid
residues in front of the amino terminus of CDK9-42. [31]
These two CDK9 isoforms are differentially expressed
and activated depending on the cell signaling stimuli,
intracellular compartment and tissue types. [32-35]
Therefore, we examined the CDK9 activity by detection
of its activation loop phosphorylation at Thr186 of CDK9
in cells treated with 2μM flavopiridol and subjected to
immunoblotting. Flavo-R exhibited prominent T-loop
phosphorylation indicating up-regulation of CDK9 kinase
activity in concert with the increased RNA transcription
activity observed in these resistant cells (Figure 3). In
addition, CDK9 protein levels were down-regulated with
flavopiridol in both isoforms, suggesting that the drug
mechanism of flavopiridol not only inhibits CDK9 kinase
activity but also protein expression.

Increased CDK9 activity with flavopiridol is
associated with phosphorylation of Ser2 at RNA
Pol II CTD in Flavo-R

CDK9 is an effective drug target of flavopiridol in
vivo for CLL

As the results of enhanced phosphorylation of
Ser2 in Flavo-R, we inspected whether the activity of
the upstream kinase of Ser2 phosphorylation, CDK9, is
upregulated with flavopiridol. CDK9/cyclin T promotes
mRNA transcriptional elongation through phosphorylation
of elongation repressors and RNA Pol II at Ser2. [25] As
in other CDKs, phosphorylation has a major regulatory
role in the CDK9 kinase activity and the conserved
phosphorylation in the activation segment/T-loop at
Thr186 is essential for CDK9 kinase activity. [29, 30]
Moreover, CDK9 promoter has two start sites yielding

We further investigated the CDK9 protein
expression in normal B-cell and B-CLL cells. CD19+
B-cells were isolated from leukopacks and CLL patients,
lysed and immunoblotted for CDK9. CLL expressed
significantly lower levels of CDK9 compared to normal
donors (Figure 4A), suggesting a potential therapeutic
index between these tumor cells and normal cells if
targeting this is the predominate mechanism of action.
We then compared in vivo CDK9 expression change

(0hr), 2, 4 and 6hr. Lysates were subjected to immunoblotting for phospho-Thr186 in the CDK9 activation loop as a surrogate for CDK9
kinase activity. Densitometry was applied to quantify the intensity of immunoreactive bands for phospho-Thr186 of both CDK9 isoforms,
which were normalized to total CDK9 and the arbitrary numbers are shown at the bottom of the figure. CDK9 kinase activity of both
isoforms was further increased with flavopiridol in Flavo-R.

between pre and post treatment of flavopiridol in samples
collected from patients enrolled in the clinical trial, a
phase II multicenter study (OSU-0491; NCT00098371).
In this trial, flavopiridol was administered as a 30-minute
loading dose followed by 4-hour continuous infusion in
patients with previously treated CLL and B-CLL cells
were isolated before and immediately after therapy at
different time points. We examined the CDK9 expression
in CLL cells before and one hour after infusion by
immunoblotting and quantifying the immunoreactive
band of CDK9 for densitometry. These data demonstrate
that CDK9-55 expression between one-hour post and pre
treatment is significantly downregulated in responders
(n=11) as compared to non-responders (n=13; p=0.018)
(Figure 4B). These data support that CDK9 could be one
of the primary targets of flavopiridol in vivo that promote
therapeutic efficacy of CLL.

cytotoxicity in primary CLL. [15] We sought to examine
if flavopiridol induces ER stress response or autophagy in
the 697 cell line. Parental and Flavo-R cells were treated
with vehicle, 2μM flavopiridol for 4-hour exposure, 1μM
dinaciclib for 2-hour exposure, and 1μM thapsigargin,
an authentic ER stress inducer as the positive control,
collected for RNA isolation at various time points and
measured by the real-time PCR with probes detecting
ER stress response genes, including IRE1, GRP78, and
XBP1. Thapsigargin treatment resulted in increased
gene expression of IRE1 and GRP78, suggesting that
697 cell line is not compromised and susceptible to ER
stress. However, unlike primary CLL, flavopiridol did not
induce ER stress response in either 697 or Flavo-R cells
(Supplemental Figure 3).
Next, flavopiridol-induced autophagy was examined
by LC3B immunoblotting in parental and Flavo-R cells.
Microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3B (LC3B)
is a mammalian homolog of Atg8, which is involved in
the autophagy biogenesis. During autophagy, a cytosolic
form of LC3B (LC3B I) is cleaved and conjugated
to phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) to form LC3BPE conjugate (LC3B II), which is later recruited to
autophagosomal membranes and subsequently degraded
in the lysosome. Thus, the lysosomal turnover of LC3B
II reflects induction of autophagy, and detection of LC3B
by immunoblotting or immunofluorescence is used as a
method for monitoring autophagy flux. [36, 37] However,

Flavopiridol-induced autophagy is elevated in
Flavo-R but not ER stress response
Our previous data in CLL have shown that
flavopiridol induces ER stress response pathways as
one of its drug actions and activation of autophagy.
[15] Concurrent treatment of flavopiridol and inhibition
of autophagy by pharmacological agents or genetic
knockdown of autophagy genes caused remarkable

healthy donors or CLL patients and lysed for western blotting. Although the heterogeneity of protein expression is observed, overall CDK9
protein expression in CLL is less than in normal B-cells. (B) Protein lysates were prepared at pre and 1-hour post flavopiridol treatment
collected on the OSU 0491 clinical trial. Comparison of CDK9-55 protein levels between post and pre showed significant decrease in partial
responders but not in non-responders (p=0.018).

increased LC3B II levels can be associated with either
enhanced autophagy activity or reduced autophagosome
turnover since autophagy is a dynamic process whereas
autophagosme is constantly produced and processed.
Hence, to better interpret changes in levels of LC3B II,
cells were treated with flavopiridol and chloroquine,
a lysosomal inhibitor that disrupts pH at the lysosome
and impairs degradation of autolysosome, resulting
in accumulation of LC3B II as an evidence of efficient
autophagic flux. Paired cells were exposed to flavopiridol
for 4 hours with or without 25μM chloroquine, collected
for protein lysates and subjected to SDS-PAGE separation
and immunoblotting for LC3B. LC3B II intensity was
measured by densitometry, quantified, and normalized
with GAPDH. Flavo-R displayed higher levels of
autophagy mediated by flavopiridol than parental cells
and the representative immunoblot is shown from 5

independent experiments (Supplemental Figure 4).
However, reversal of this process in the cell line does not
result in sensitization as seen with ER stress-mediated
autophagy which was shown previously in primary CLL.
[15]

Increase of Mcl-1 stability with flavopiridol is
observed in Flavo-R cells
Flavopiridol-induced apoptosis has been associated
with down-regulation of Mcl-1 in several cell systems.
[10, 23, 38] Therefore, we investigated whether Mcl-1
contributed to the resistance to flavopiridol. Examination
of Mcl-1 expression levels in parental and Flavo-R cells
post drug treatment indicated increased Mcl-1 protein and
transcript levels in Flavo-R cells (Figure 5). Parental and

Figure 5: Mcl-1 protein levels are more stable to antagonize the flavopiridol-mediated depletion in Flavo-R. (A) Cells

were treated with continues exposure of 0.3μM flavopiridol or 2-hour exposure of 2μM flavopiridol with washout (w/o) and harvested for
lysates and RNA preparation at pre (0 hr), 1, 2 and 4hr post treatment. Quantitative real-time PCR with TaqMan probes for Mcl-1 was used
to measure its transcript abundance after treatment. Flavo-R showed significantly more Mcl-1 transcripts with both doses of flavopiridol
at 6-hr time point. (B) Immunoblotting was applied to detect Mcl-1 protein levels in protein lysates collected from cells treated with 2μM
flavopiridol for 4 hours and washout (w/o). (C) Densitometry is utilized to quantify the intensity of immunoreactive bands for Mcl-1 that is
normalized to GAPDH and the bar graph shows the average of densitometry measurement of three independent experiments. Mcl-1 protein
expression is more stable with the flavopiridol treatment in these resistant cells. (D) Cells were treated with 100µg/ml cycloheximide
(CHX) to inhibit overall protein translation and compared with Mcl-1 protein stability between parental cells and Flavo-R. Treated cells
were collected at pre (0h), 2, 4, and 6hr to assay short-life Mcl-1 protein levels by immunoblotting. (E) The bar graph shows the average
of densitometry measurement of the intensity of immunoreactive bands for Mcl-1, which was normalized to GAPDH in three independent
experiments. Levels of Mcl-1 protein expression are more stable in Flavo-R.

via the proteasome pathway. Moreover, Pepper et al. have
demonstrated that flavopiridol decreases phosphorylation
of ERK in CLL 24hr post- in vitro treatment measured
by flow cytometry. [41] Thus, we scrutinize whether ERK
activity is upregulated to stabilize Mcl-1 in Flavo-R.
The activity of ERK was assessed by its activation loop
phosphorylation at Thr202/Tyr204 and Thr185/Tyr187
of ERK1 and ERK2 respectively (Figure 6A and 6B).
Increase of ERK phosphorylation with flavopiridol is
correlated with more stabilized Mcl-1 protein levels
in Flavo-R. Therefore, we further examine if ERK
phosphorylates Mcl-1 to promote its protein stabilization
and prevent it from the ubiquitin-conjugated degradation
pathway. Due to a lack of commercial available antibodies
to recognize the ERK-mediated phosphorylation at Thr163 on PEST domain of Mcl-1, we alternatively exploited
the immunoprecipitation-western blotting to measure the
levels of ubiquitinated Mcl-1 in parental and Flavo-R
cells. Ubiquitinated proteins were pulled down with the
ubiquitin-affinity agarose from total lysates isolated from
pre and 4-hour exposure of 2μM flavopiridol, yielded to
SDS-PAGE separation and immunoblotting for Mcl-1.
Lower levels of ubiquitinated-Mcl-1 were observed in
Flavo-R compared to parental cells, implicating that Mcl1 in Flavo-R is less subjected to ubiquitin-conjugated
degradation. (Figure 6C)

Flavo-R cells were treated with flavopiridol, harvested
for RNA or protein isolation, and then analyzed by the
real-time PCR or immunoblotting for Mcl-1. Significantly
sustained levels of Mcl-1 mRNA transcript were observed
in Flavo-R cells following flavopiridol treatment at 6-hour
time point (Figure 5A). In addition, Flavo-R cells exhibited
more resistance to flavopiridol-mediated Mcl-1 protein
degradation (Figure 5B and 5C). Stability of other antiapoptotic proteins, Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, were also examined;
however, there is no difference with flavopiridol treatment
between parental and Flavo-R cells. (Supplemental Figure
5) Our results showed that Flavo-R cells could overcome
flavopiridol-induced cell death and developed resistance
by elevating Mcl-1 levels. In all, our data implicate that
these resistant cells are in part reminiscent of the clinical
observations and can provide further understanding of
resistant mechanism of flavopiridol.

Up-regulation of Mcl-1 attributed to the
translational stabilization through MAPK/ERK
activation
Since Mcl-1 protein stability was increased and
Mcl-1 transcripts recovered quicker after flavopiridol
removal in Flavo-R (Figure 5), therefore we examined
the mechanism underlying the stability of Mcl-1 in
these resistant cell lines. Mcl-1 has a very short halflife, estimated at less an hour, which can be seen with
transcriptional inhibitor, actinomycin D (ActD). [39]
Sensitive and resistant cell lines were treated with ActD,
harvested, isolated for RNA and analyzed by the real-time
PCR with probes for Mcl-1. We detected no differences in
Mcl-1 mRNA half-life, indicating that increased stability
of Mcl-1 is not due to transcriptionally up-regulation of
Mcl-1 levels in Flavo-R (Supplemental Figure 6). Based
on these results, we examined whether upregulated Mcl1 levels are due to the protein stabilization. Cells were
treated with cycloheximide, a protein synthesis inhibitor
used to measure the translational stability. Protein lysates
were obtained after cycloheximide treatment from parental
and resistant cells and performed immunoblotting for Mcl1 (Figure 5D). We found that Mcl-1 protein levels are less
susceptible to flavopiridol-mediated down-regulation in
Flavo-R compared to the parental cell line. The average of
densitometry measurement of Mcl-1 protein levels in three
independent experiments is shown in Figure 5E.
Inasmuch as increased Mcl-1 levels in Flavo-R are
attributed to the translational stabilization, we further
investigated if this stabilization results from activation
of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK/ERK)modulated pathway. Phosphorylation of Thr163 of Mcl1 in the PEST region by ERK has been shown to slow
turnover of Mcl-1 protein. [40] PEST sequence is enriched
in proline, glutamic acid, serine, and threonine and is
associated with proteins subjected to rapid degradation

Mcl-1 knockdown restores partial sensitivity to
flavopiridol
The translational stabilization of Mcl-1 is shown to
be associated with the resistant to flavopiridol in Flavo-R.
Thus, we investigated whether reducing levels of Mcl-1
could sensitize Flavo-R again via the therapeutic agent or
genetic knockdown. MEK inhibitor, CI-1040, was used
to inhibit the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinases
(MEK) and the downstream MAPK/ERK activities to
decrease phosphorylation of Mcl-1 and hence its stability.
However, combination of CI-1040, and flavopiridol
had no effect on re-sensitizing Flavo-R via the measure
of the cell viability due to the ineffective inhibition of
ERK1/2 activity by CI-1040 (data not shown). We then
used alternative approach to infect parental and Flavo-R
cells with specific shRNA constructs targeting Mcl-1 as
well as a control. After puromycin selection, we were
able to identify a stable clone, shMcl-1 390 that exhibited
a significant knockdown of Mcl-1 compared to the
control for further analyses (Supplemental Figure 7). We
then examined the sensitivity of Flavo-R with shMcl-1
knockdown to flavopiridol compared to the control.
Although, shMcl-1 knockdown did not completely restore
the sensitivity to flavopiridol to parental levels, reduction
of Mcl-1 levels did result in more cell death in 697
flavopiridol-resistant cells (p=0.0106) (Figure 6D). These
results suggest that while Mcl-1 up-regulation is important

clinical trials, it is largely unknown about the resistance
mechanism of flavopiridol. The acquired resistance
is poorly understood and is currently approached by
correlating the inherent genetics with responses to stratify
patients for clinical purposes. However, the mechanism
of acquired resistance to therapies may be different from
the cause before treatment and specifically developed in
response to this treatment. Therefore, the study herein is
an attempt to understand the molecular basis of acquired
resistance to flavopiridol in a leukemia model to provide
insight in clinically relevant understanding for refractory/
relapsed patients.
In our flavopiridol-resistant leukemia cell line
model, our results implicate that selection for elevated
CDK9 kinase activity, upregulated transcriptional
activity, induction of autophagy, and increase of Mcl-l

DISCUSSION
Flavopiridol has shown promise particularly in CLL
with potent cytotoxicity and effectiveness with genetically
high-risk patients, especially those with del(17p13.1) and
del(11q22.3). [9, 11, 12] Thus, flavopiridol and other
cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors are pursued as single
agents for the frontline treatment for patients with poorrisk cytogenetic abnormalities, as well as combination
therapies in relapsed/refractory disease. Despite few
clinical reports on the correlation of response and

preventing Mcl-1 from degradation. Phosphorylation of ERK was assayed by phospho-ERK1/2 antibodies to indicate the activation status
of ERK kinase activity. (B) Densitometry was used to quantify the intensity of immunoreactive bands for phospho-ERK1/2, which was
normalized to total ERK and GAPDH and the bar graph shows the average of densitometry measurement of three independent experiments.
(C) Ubiquitinated proteins were pulled down with the ubiquitin-affinity agarose, subjected to SDS-PAGE separation and immunoblotted
with the Mcl-1 antibody. The level of ubiquitinated Mcl-1 is reduced in Flavo-R with 4-hour exposure of 2μM flavopiridol, implicating
that Mcl-1 in Flavo-R is less subjected to ubiquitin-conjugated degradation. (D) Stable clones for Mcl-1 and control knockdown in 697 and
Flavo-R cells were treated with 0.3μM or 0.5μM flavopiridol continuously and assayed for the cellular apoptosis 24-hours post treatment
with annexin V-FITC and PI-PE stains analyzed by flow cytometry.

stability concomitantly contributes to resistance to
flavopiridol. CDK9 has been reported as the primary
target of flavopiridol as well as down-regulation of RNA
transcription activity and Mcl-1 levels. [10, 15, 17, 23] In
concert with these findings, the resistant cells demonstrate
enhanced CDK9 activity and hence RNA Pol II activity
antagonistic toward flavopiridol’s actions, emphasizing
the importance of these targeted pathways in flavopiridolmediated cell death. Our data also suggest that flavopiridol
not only inhibits phosphorylation of RNA Pol II but
also its upstream kinase CDK9 in terms of its protein
expression and kinase activity to potentiate its capability
in induction of cytotoxicity. Notably, change of CDK9-55
protein expression after therapy inversely correlates with
response to flavopiridol, indicating CDK9 is the primary
therapeutic target in vivo. It has been demonstrated that
CDK9-55 expression is associated with the regulation of
the cell differentiation program of various tissues, such as
the hematopoietic compartment and muscles. [33, 42, 43]
However, limited data are available regarding the function
of CDK9-55 separately from CDK9-42 in hematopoietic
and lymphoid tissues. Further study is necessary to
delineate the role of CDK9-55 and its related pathways
in CLL to fully characterize the molecular actions of
flavopiridol and to improve CDK9-targeted therapies. In
addition to the phosphorylation of the RNA Pol II CTD,
CDK9 has been shown to be involved in the transcription
regulation of NFκB and STAT3 and interaction with
a variety of factors, such as retinoblastoma (Rb), p53
and c-Myc that may also contribute to the resistance of
flavopiridol and are worthy of investigation to delineate
the molecular mechanism of the drug action. [44-47]
Furthermore, increase of Mcl-1 protein stability
is observed in this leukemia model, suggesting the Mcl1 protein level directly contributes to the resistance of
flavopiridol. Mcl-1 is an essential survival factor in
lymphocytes supported by a mouse model conditional
for Mcl-1 that displays a profound reduction in B and
T lymphocytes. [48] An inverse correlation was found
between Mcl-1 expression and Rai stage and sensitivities
of the leukemic cells to chemotherapies in CLL. [49] Our
data show that resistant cells maintained substantial levels
of Mcl-1 protein with flavopiridol, which is associated
with ERK activation. Cycloheximide treatment determined
that Mcl-1 is translationally more stable in the resistant
cells in accordance with the elevated ERK activity and
the reduced ubiquitin modification detected in Flavo-R. In
concert with previous findings, our data demonstrate that
increased translational stabilization of Mcl-1 is mediated
by ERK phosphorylation to prevent ubiquitin-dependent
degradation. Furthermore, knockdown of Mcl-1 partially
restores the sensitivity in Flavo-R, validating that Mcl-1 is
a key controller of drug resistance.
Interestingly, Flavo-R shows cross-resistance to
another CDK inhibitor, dinaciclib while exposed to 1μM
concentration for 2 hours and washed off. Dinaciclib is a
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

more selective CDK inhibitor of CDK1, CDK2, CDK5,
and CDK9 with IC50 of <5nM in an in vitro kinase assay
and currently under development of phase III clinical
trial in CLL. Compared with flavopiridol in an in vitro
kinase assay, dinaciclib inhibits CDK1 and CDK9 equally
but CDK2 and CDK5 with more than 10-fold potency.
[24] Likewise, dinaciclib demonstrated remarkable
cytotoxicity in CLL and in vivo inhibition of Mcl-1
expression and PARP cleavage in acute myeloid leukemia
patients. Preclinical data in melanoma mouse xenografts
and osteosarcoma cells, showed that dinaciclib induces
apoptosis, increases Bax and Bim in mitochondria, and
decease antiapoptotic factors, such as Mcl-1, Bcl-2, BclxL and XIAP, as well as phosphorylation of Ser2 of RNA
Pol II. [25, 50-52] This is also supported by our findings
that the flavopiridol-resistant cells became insusceptible
to dinaciclib and displayed increased levels of Mcl-1 and
P-TEFb activity while treated with this drug. Thus, these
results suggest that both flavopiridol and dinaciclib initiate
the apoptotic effects primarily through inactivation of
CDK9 and transcription in concert with down-regulation
of Mcl-1.
Taken together, we demonstrate the mechanisms of
resistance that are selected specifically for the acquired
resistance to flavopiridol in the leukemia cells. The
investigation of resistance mechanisms reveals that
increased levels of Mcl-1 and CDK9 activity attribute to
overcoming flavopiridol-induced cell death. Combined
with the results from clinical trials with flavopiridol, it is
apparently favorable to continuously develop therapies
targeting CDK9 in CLL. In all, our collective data suggest
that future studies are warranted to scrutinize targeted
therapies for Mcl-1 and CDK9-associated pathways to
combat the resistance to flavopiridol.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Generation of flavopiridol-resistant (Flavo-R) cell
lines
The 697 cell line was obtained from American
Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and cultured in
RPMI-1640 medium (Life Technologies, Grand Island,
NY) supplemented with 10% FBS, L-glutamine and
antibiotics (Life Technologies). 697 cells were treated
with gradually increasing doses of flavopiridol, with the
drug being eluted off to allow recovery. 697 Flavo-R
was eventually cultured to be resistant to flavopiridol at
0.5μM. Cells were examined for the intracellular drug
concentration of flavopiridol to exclude the possibility of
acquiring resistance due to up-regulation of drug efflux
or accumulation (data not shown). [53] Cytogenetic
characterization of parental and resistant cells revealed
similar patterns (Supplemental Table 1).

RNA isolation and quantitative real-time PCR
Cells were homogenized with TRIzol reagent
(Life Technologies) and isolated for RNA by RNeasy
Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). cDNA was prepared
with random hexamers (Life Technologies) and M-MLV
reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies). Gene expression
was measured by the quantitative real-time PCR with
TaqMan gene expression assays for Mcl-1 and CD52 (Life
Technologies) and detected by ViiA 7 Real-Time PCR
System (Life Technologies). Average relative expression
(treatment compared to vehicle) was normalized to the
endogenous control gene, CD52, and calculated by the
comparative Ct (cycle number required to reach detection
threshold) method, known as 2-(ΔΔCt) method. [57] Mcl1 mRNA stability was determined following 2μg/ml
actinomycin D treatment and the real-time PCR analysis.

For both in vivo and in vitro studies, written,
informed consent was obtained in accordance with the
Declaration of Helsinki to procure cells from patients
diagnosed with CLL as defined by the modified iwCLL
2008 criteria. [54] Approval was obtained from The Ohio
State University (OSU) institutional review board. CD19+
cells from CLL patients, and healthy volunteers were
isolated and maintained in culture as previously described.
[15] Flavopiridol (alvocidib) and dinaciclib (SCH 727965)
were obtained from the National Cancer Institute. Both
were dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide at 22.8mM and
10mM respectively, and stored at -80°C in small aliquots.
Cells were treated with flavopiridol in RPMI-1640 medium
supplemented with 10% human serum (Valley Biomedical,
Winchester, VA), and L-glutamine and antibiotics. In
order to resemble the clinical administration schedule
for correlating pharmacodynamics markers and findings
from our in vitro studies to clinical data, we expose
cells 2μM flavopiridol for 4 hours or 1μM dinaciclib for
2-hour exposure with the wash out procedure if the time
point is longer than 4 or 2 hours respectively. [7, 12, 25]
Thapsigargin, chloroquine, actinomycin D, cycloheximide,
fludarabine, CI-1040, and puromycin were purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO.

Cell apoptosis assays
Cell death was measured 24-hour post treatment
with fluorescein-conjugated annexin V and propidium
iodide (PI) (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) and
analyzed by a FC500 flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter,
Indianapolis, IN) as described previously. [24, 25] Results
were normalized to control cells that had been treated with
vehicle.

Immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation (IP)Western

Generation of lentiviral-based knockdown cell
lines

As described previously, cells were lysed, sonicated
and protein concentration was quantified by BCA
analysis (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL). 50μg of
protein lysate was resolved on SDS-PAGE, transferred to
PVDF membrane, and blotted with specific primary and
secondary antibodies (Sigma-Aldrich) accordingly. [15]
For IP-Western, 500μg of protein lysate was incubated
with Ubiquilin 1 tandem UBA (TUBE2) agarose (Boston
Biochem, Cambridge, MA) in the IP buffer (25mM
Tris•HCl, pH7.4, 150mM NaCl and 1% NP-40) on a
rotation platform at 4ºC overnight. Ubiquitinated proteins
were bound to the agarose, washed three times with IP
buffer and subjected to immunoblotting. [55, 56] Primary
antibodies were used for Mcl-1, CDK9, actin (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, Dallas, TX), phospho-Pol II CTD at Ser2
and Ser5, Pol II CTD (Covance, Princeton, NJ), phosphoERK1/2, ERK1/2, phospho-CDK9, phospho-Bcl-2, BclxL (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA), Bcl-2
(Dako, Carpinteria, CA) and GAPDH (EMD Millipore,
Billerica, MA). Densitometry of immunoreactive bands
on immunoblots was measured with FluorChem E
System (ProteinSimple, Santa Clara, CA), quantified and
normalized with AlphaView (ProteinSimple).

Mcl-1 knockdown was achieved in 697 cells with
short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) by lentiviral transduction
using calcium phosphate method (Promega, Madison,
WI) according to Byrd lab protocol modified from
Current Protocol in Molecular Biology. [58] Knockdown
clones with stable expression of pLKO.1 vector (Thermo
Scientific) or Mcl-1 shRNAs (Sigma-Aldrich) were
selected and cultured with puromycin.

Statistical analysis
Mixed effects models were used for experiments
involving cell viability (Flavo-R versus parental cells as
well as in the presence of shMcl-1 knockdown), Mcl-1
expression in Flavo-R and parental cell line, and CDK955 protein expression. For the cell viability experiments,
viability (% of annexin V and PI negative cells relative to
media) in the presence of either flavopiridol or dinaciclib
was compared between 697 Flavo-R and 697 separately.
Due to the similar effects of continuous 0.2µM, 0.3µM
flavopiridol, p-values for the average effect over both
doses are presented, rather than for each dose separately.
Similarly, the effect of shMcl-1 knockdown on cell
2676

Oncotarget

viability in the presence of flavopiridol was calculated
from the mixed effects model; the average effect of 0.3µM
and 0.5µM flavopiridol was estimated for both parental
and Flavo-R cell lines separately, and an interaction
contrast was used to assess the relative effect between the
two cell lines. For Mcl-1 expression, differences in fold
change at 6-hour post-treatment between the Flavo-R
and parental cells were estimated. CDK9-55 expression
between one-hour post and pre-treatment was compared
between partial responders and non-responders using an
interaction contrast from the mixed effects model; data
were first natural log-transformed to stabilize variances.
All analyses were performed using SAS/STAT software,
version 9.2 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC).
