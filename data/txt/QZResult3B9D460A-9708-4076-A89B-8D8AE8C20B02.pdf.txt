ABSTRACT
An amphiphilic copolymer, folic acid (FA) modified poly(ethylene glycol)poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (FA-PEG-PLGA) was prepared and explored as a
nanometer carrier for the co-delivery of cisplatin (cis-diaminodichloroplatinum, CDDP)
and paclitaxel (PTX). CDDP and PTX were encapsulated inside the hydrophobic inner
core and chelated to the middle shell, respectively. PEG provided the outer corona
for prolonged circulation. An in vitro release profile of the CDDP + PTX-encapsulated
nanoparticles revealed that the PTX chelation cross-link prevented an initial burst
release of CDDP. After an incubation period of 24 hours, the CDDP+PTX-encapsulated
nanoparticles exhibited a highly synergistic effect for the inhibition of A549 (FA
receptor negative) and M109 (FA receptor positive) lung cancer cell line proliferation.
Pharmacokinetic experiment and distribution research shows that nanoparticles
have longer circulation time in the blood and can prolong the treatment times of
chemotherapeutic drugs. For the in vivo treatment of A549 cells xeno-graft lung tumor,
the CDDP+PTX-encapsulated nanoparticles displayed an obvious tumor inhibiting
effect with an 89.96% tumor suppression rate (TSR). This TSR was significantly
higher than that of free chemotherapy drug combination or nanoparticles with a
single drug. For M109 cells xeno-graft tumor, the TSR was 95.03%. In vitro and in
vivo experiments have all shown that the CDDP+PTX-encapsulated nanoparticles have
better targeting and antitumor effects in M109 cells than CDDP+PTX-loaded PEG-PLGA
nanoparticles (p < 0.05). In addition, more importantly, the enhanced anti-tumor
efficacy of the CDDP+PTX-encapsulated nanoparticles came with reduced side-effects.
No obvious body weight loss or functional changes occurred within blood components,
liver, or kidneys during the treatment of A549 and M109 tumor-bearing mice with the
CDDP+PTX-encapsulated nanoparticles. Thus, the FA modified amphiphilic copolymerbased combination of CDDP and PTX may provide useful guidance for effective and
safe cancer chemotherapy, especially in tumors with high FA receptor expression.

INTRODUCTION

with an unprecedented opportunity for novel combination
strategy and drug targeting delivery. [5] Compared to the
combination of free drugs, the combination of several
kinds of drugs, within a single nanocarrier, can remarkably
reduce non-specific interactions of free drugs with normal
tissues. In addition, the drug combination can increase
the accumulation of combination drugs in solid tumors
through the enhanced permeability and retention effect
(EPR). Therefore, this treatment method enhances the
chemotherapeutic efficacy while decreasing toxicity and
other side effects. [6, 7] Furthermore, such co-delivery
systems guarantee the simultaneous delivery of sufficient
amount of drugs to tumor site while giving full play to
the synergistic effect and the improved antitumor efficacy.
However, for CDDP and PTX, the challenge of
entrapment of the two drugs into a co-delivery system
might primarily be due to the hydrophilic, metal complex
nature of CDDP and the hydrophobic nature of PTX.
Therefore, although the combination of free-CDDP and
free-PTX has been used as the first-line treatment for
various solid tumors, the co-delivery of CDDP and PTX
was rarely investigated. Song et al. employed methoxypoly(ethylene glycol)-b-poly(L-glutamic acid)-b-poly(Lphenylalanine) (mPEG-b-P(Glu)-b-P(Phe)) triblock
copolymer nanoparticles (NPs) as carriers to co-delivery
CDDP and PTX, and received a synergistic antitumor
effect in vitro/in vivo. [8] However, such NPs lack a
targeting group which leads to lack of active targeting and
reduces the targeting efficiency.
In order to co-deliver multiple chemotherapeutic
agents with strong polymer/agent interactions and robust
construct stability, an amphiphilic copolymer, folic acid
(FA) modified poly(ethylene glycol)-poly(lactic-coglycolic acid) (FA-PEG-PLGA), was used as a favorable
carrier for the co-delivery of CDDP and PTX in the study.
In the NPs, covalent conjugation of FA could provide
active targeting and enhanced specificity uptake of the
NPs by overexpression of folate receptors by tumor cells
while sparing in normal tissues, thus, improving drug
efficacy and reducing its side effects. [9] Poly(ethylene
glycol) (PEG) was the outer corona and provides the
prolonged blood circulation of the NPs by reducing nonspecific interactions with blood components. The PLGA
component of hydrophobic serves as a reservoir for the
lipophilic drug. The anionic copolymer provides the strong
electrostatic interaction with cationic CDDP. [10]
The physiochemical properties, stability, in vitro
drug release behavior, pharmacokinetic characteristics, and
in vivo biodistribution were investigated. The synergistic
antitumor effect of the CDDP and PTX co-delivered FAPEG-PLGA NPs (Co-FA-NPs) was evaluated both in vitro
and in vivo.

In small-molecule-based chemotherapy, the use
of a single agent often cannot achieve complete tumor
remission due to the rapid development of drug resistance
of tumor cells. However, the combination therapy of
multiple drugs with different action mechanisms, has
proven to be an effective strategy in clinical cancer
treatments. Combination chemotherapy offers several
benefits. First, applying multiple drugs with different
action mechanisms can delay the related cancer cell
mutations and the cancer adaption process. Second,
multiple drugs targeting the tumor cells can function
synergistically, thereby, reducing drug side effects
by decreasing drug doses and achieving synergistic
therapeutic efficacy. [1, 2]
However, it is difficult to combine free drugs to
obtain optimal anticancer effect. The combination of
free drugs often brought more serious toxic side effects
to humans, which has been a serious problem in clinical
cancer treatments. In addition, their different biochemical
properties and pharmacokinetic characteristics affect
synergistic therapeutic efficacy. [3] The combination
of cisplatin (cis-diaminodichloroplatinum, CDDP) and
paclitaxel (PTX) is a prime example of this phenomenon.
CDDP is one of the most widely used DNA-modifying
chemotheraputic drugs which can induce each cell cycle
of cancer cell to apoptosis. [4] PTX, as a representative
microtubule-stabilizing chemotherapeutic drug, is
highly hydrophobic with very poor water solubility. The
combination of free-CDDP and free-PTX has shown a
positive synergistic effect against a wide range of tumors
due to different action mechanisms of CDDP and PTX.
Currently, the combination of free-CDDP and free-PTX
drugs has become the first-line chemotherapeutic agent
for advanced breast cancer, advanced non-small-cell
lung cancer (NSCLC), advanced gastric cancer, ovarian
cancer, etc. However, drug combination is not as simple
as just putting things together. One of the most important
dose-limiting side effects of CDDP is nephrotoxicity. This
increased side effect was observed when CDDP was coadministered with PTX for treatment of lung cancer, in
comparison to administering CDDP alone. In the advanced
transitional urothelium carcinoma study, the combination
of free-CDDP and free-PTX also showed an effective
clinical response. However, there was also an increased
toxic effect. Therefore, it could not be applied to patients
with poor performance status or those over 70 years of
age. In the advanced ovarian cancer study, the combination
of free-CDDP and free-PTX did not significantly improve
the survival times. However, it did increase hematological
toxicities, nephrotoxicity, and hospitalizations. Therefore,
the additional clinical benefit gained from the combination
chemotherapy of free-CDDP and free-PTX was discounted
because of the increased side effects.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

The NPs have appropriate size to evade endocytosis and
destruction by the reticuloendothelial system (RES).
Therefore, they are able to survive longer in circulation. In
addition, the appropriate size may bring to ideal targeting.
The obtained NPs were characterized by DLS. Table 1
summarized the average size of these NPs. The average
size and zeta potential of blank NPs was 134.71±6.42 nm
and - 26.12±1.23 mV, respectively. The size polydispersity
index was 0.165. CDDP-FA-NPs and PTX-FA-NPs were
larger than blank NPs, which indicates that CDDP and
PTX in the core of the NPs increased the volume. Codelivery NPs showed the larger diameter and smaller
polydispersity than blank, CDDP-, and PTX-FA-NPs,
which could be attributed to presence of hydrophobic
PTX, thus, making the amphiphilic polymers form an
intensive structure. [2, 33, 34] In co-delivery NPs, the
size was increased with increasing PTX content (partial
data not shown). In addition, the PTX-FA-NPs were also
larger than CDDP-FA-NPs. These indicated that PTX
of hydrophobic has more effects for size than CDDP of
polarity. When comparing CDDP-FA-NPs and PTX-FANPs with blank NPs, blank NPs have the lowest zeta
potential. In co-delivery NPs, the zeta potential was
increased with increase of CDDP content ratio. These
indicated that CDDP of large polarity has more effects for
zeta potential than PTX of non-polarity.
The morphology of blank NPs and Co-FA-NPs
was characterized using TEM (Figure 2A). The TEM
results show that blank NPs and Co-FA-NPs were single
uniformity spherical particles, and the diameter of blank
NPs was smaller than the diameter of Co-FA-NPs with

Characterizations of FA-PEG-PLGA polymer
The obtained PLGA, PEG-PLGA, and FA-PEGPLGA polymer was characterized by 1H-NMR. In
1
H-NMR of PLGA (Figure 1A), PEG-PLGA (Figure 1B)
and FA-PEG-PLGA (Figure 1C), the integrated signals,
around 1.6 ppm, were attributed to the methyl protons of
the L- and D-lactic acid units. The large peak, at 3.6 ppm,
in Figure 1B was assigned to the methylene protons of the
PEG. The peaks of the glycolic acid CH2 protons were
at 4.8 ppm and the lactic acid CH were assigned at 5.2
ppm. The resulting conjugates of FA were confirmed by
1
H-NMR, and the peak of FA was assigned at 2.3 ppm (γCH2, glutamic acid), 6.6 and 7.6 ppm (aromatic protons),
and 8.6 ppm (pteridine proton) (Figure 1C). [32] The
aforementioned is indicative of the successful synthesis of
PLGA, PEG-PLGA and FA-PEG-PLGA copolymer. The
final conjugation percentage of folic acid to PEG-PLGA
was 43.1%.

the uniformity diameter of 150 nm and an intensive shellcore structure. Meantime, the narrow polydispersity, at a
diameter of 180 nm, of Co-FA-NPs was obtained by DLS.
The polydispersity was narrower than 0.165 of blank NPs
and the diameter were larger than 134.71 nm of blank NPs
(Figure 2B).
As shown in Table 2, when the polymer/drug
ratio was 40:2:1, CDDP and PTX in Co-FA-NPs have
the highest loaded efficiencies at 62.43 and 71.71%,
respectively. The highest DLC was 12.07% at a polymer/
drug ratio of 40:2:4.

media (pH 9.1). It can determined that poly(lactic acid)
polymer was faster to degrade in alkaline media than
that in acidic media. However, the degradation did not
obviously change drug release within 5 days. It is possible
that the pH value effect on drug release was greater than
that of NPs degradation (Figure 3B).
A distinct advantage offered by co-delivery systems
of multiple drugs is controlled release of the drug, which
greatly intensifies the synergistic bioavailability of
the drugs and lessens the resultant side effects of these
drugs to healthy body tissues by the EPR effects. [35]
In vitro release profiles of Co-FA-NPs were acquired in
PBS with a pH of 5.0 and an additional solution with a
pH of 7.4. The release processes of both CDDP and PTX
were affected by a change in the pH value of the solution
(Figure 3B). The associated releases of CDDP and PTX, in
PBS solution with a pH of 7.4 (blood environment), were
slow and requires approximately 264 hours to completely
release. According to the study, the Co-FA-NPs were
primarily binding to FA receptors in the cell membrane,
taken up by cells via endocytosis or potential pinocytosis,
then degraded, metabolized, and released the drug in the
lysosome (acidic environment). [2, 10, 36] Moreover, the
inner environment in the tumor was also acidic (pH 4-5).
Consequently, examination of these release profiles of
Co-FA-NPs under acidic pH value and blood pH value
environment is crucial. In comparison to the release
profiles when the pH is 5.0, the release of the drug in
pH 7.4 PBS was much slower than that in the acidic

Stability and in vitro drug release of co-delivery
NPs
Clinical pharmaceutical applications of NPs
formulation should have ideal stability because the
stability of NPs is crucial for in vitro long-term storage
and transportation, in vivo targeting, and long circulation.
[2] A total of 1 mg/mL of NPs were prepared by directly
dissolving co-delivery NPs (CDDP: PTX = 1:2) in PBS
(pH 5.0, 7.4, 9.1), 5% FBS or 2% BSA, then sonicated
for 5 min. The NPs were placed at 37oC, and size change
was detected. It can be seen, from Figure 3A, there was no
significant change in the size of Co-FA-NPs (CDDP: PTX
= 1:2) within 5 days, which was beneficial for clinical
applications. However, compared to the acidic media (pH
5.0), a slightly smaller size was still observed in alkaline

environment. For the simulated blood environment, CDDP
and PTX were completely released within 150 hours. After
co-incubation with 5% FBS or 2% BSA solution, it can
been seen that the diameter of Co-FA-NPs were slightly
increased within 5 days, however, the increment value
were less than 40 and 20 nm, respectively (Figure 3C).
The release profiles of CDDP and PTX in FBS and BSA
solution were also slow. The release time in 5% FBS was
120 hours, the release time of CDDP and PTX in 2%
BSA were 168 and 144 hours, respectively (Figure 3D).
Consequently, the release profiles, acquired from CDDP

and PTX, indicate the co-delivery system successfully
provided the same biochemical and pharmacokinetic
characteristics and their synergistic effect. In theory, PTX
is initially released once the outermost copolymer layer
breaks off. Once the outermost copolymer layer breaks
off, the unstable core structure with hydrophobic surface
rapidly disintegrates and initiates the release of CDDP.
[2, 10] The Co-NPs (CDDP: PTX = 1:2) have the similar
stability and release profiles with Co-FA-NPs (CDDP:
PTX = 1:2) (Figure 3 and Figure 4).

In vitro cytotoxicity

that the manner in which the drug is released from the
endosomes/lysosomes into the cytosols is highly efficient.
However, in L929 and R 1610 cells, the co-delivery
NPs exhibited less cytotoxicity which could be due to
the fact that the L929 and R1610 cells belong to normal
cells which proliferate slower than tumor cells. Doubling
time was obviously longer than tumor cells, therefore,
the synergistic effect of two chemotherapeutic drugs in
the same vehicle was unapparent within 24 hours. In the
M109 cell line, the cell viability of single drug-loaded NPs
groups was significantly less than that of free-drug groups,
and the cell viability of Co-FA-NPs groups was obviously
lower than that of Co-NPs (CDDP: PTX = 1:2) (p < 0.01).
In addition, the cell viability of Co-FA-NPs in M109 cells
was lower than that in A549 cells (p < 0.05). These should
be the covalent conjugations of FA groups which provide
active targeting and enhanced uptake of the NPs by M109
cells by overexpressing folate receptors, increasing tumor
cell death, and improving drug efficacy.

In our study, the combination of CDDP and PTX
was incorporated in order to demonstrate the synergistic
effect of multiple chemotherapeutic drugs. L929, R1610,
A549, and M109 cells were incubated independently
among 96-well plates. Once the cells adhered, they were
subsequently treated for a period of 24 hours with the freeCDDP, free-PTX, CDDP-FA-NPs, PTX-FA-NPs, freeCDDP + free-PTX, Co-FA-NPs, and Co-NPs containing
10.0 μg/mL of drug concentration. The blank NPs and
without NPs treat-cell were used as controls. Figure 5
clearly represents the significant reduction in tumor cell
viability associated with the co-delivery of CDDP and
PTX (p < 0.01 compared with free-CDDP groups) in
A549 and M109 cell lines. For L929, R 1610, and A549
cell lines, free single drug and single drug-loaded NPs
were associated with similar cytotoxicity, which confirms

We also examined the role of drug ratio in the
inhibition of cancer cells. In A549 and M109 cells,
the viability of co-delivery NPs, with the CDDP/PTX
concentration of 1:2, was approximately cut in half in
comparison to free-CDDP. Moreover, the co-delivery
NPs, with CDDP/PTX concentration of 1:2, exhibited
the greatest anti-tumor activity among the two different
varieties of lung cancer cells.
The resultant synergistic effect can be obtained
through the combination of the associated anti-tumor
mechanisms of each drug. It was well-known that CDDP,
inserted into DNA, triggers many molecular events that
induce apoptosis in cancer cells. PTX has the ability to
inhibit microtubule disassembly and produce a highly
stabilizing microtubule. This inhibition disrupts the
normal metabolism for mitosis and cell proliferation, thus,
inducing cell apoptosis. According to our in vitro studies,
when using CDDP and PTX together with a ratio of 1:2,
the synergistic effects could promote and accelerate tumor
cell death. The combination of these two individual drugs

in any other (2:1 or 1:1) produces lessened anti-tumor
efficacy.

Pharmacokinetic assay
The pharmacokinetics associated with both freedrug and drug-loaded NPs were investigated by tail
intravenous injection. Small amounts of the blood was
collected from the rats and CDDP, PTX levels were
calculated through the use of HPLC. A two-compartment
model was the preferred method to assess the many
pharmacokinetic parameters of CDDP and PTX in
plasma. The pharmacokinetic parameters, which describe
the bodily effects from free-drug or drug-loaded NPs, are
of extreme importance to the scientific community. The
parameters of greatest importance are AUC, CL, MRT,
t1/2 (half-life) and Vd,ss. [37, 38, 39] In addition to these
parameters describing the behavior of free-drug and
drug-loaded NPs, these parameters are also useful for
determining future clinical applications.

Table 4: Blood component changing following various drugs treatments.

The pharmacokinetic effects for free-drug and
drug-loaded NPs are clearly depicted in Figure 6. FreeCDDP and free-PTX revealed rapid system clearance
after administration. Following the CDDP-loaded NPs
and PTX-loaded NPs, the Co-FA-NPs was the slowest.
The concentration of free-CDDP and free-PTX decreases
to less than 3 and 9.5 μg/mL, respectively, within 5 hours.
CDDP and PTX concentration, in Co-FA-NPs, remain
at approximately 8.13 and 14.22 μg/mL, respectively,
up to 24 hours. The Co-FA-NPs shows prolonged blood
circulation time. The prolonged blood circulation time

is a direct result of the enhanced retention effect of the
poly(ethylene glycol) shell that contains a slightly negative
surface charge of NPs which is associated with repulsion
of negatively charged RBC’s.
The pharmacokinetic parameters are clearly depicted
in Table 3. CDDP-loaded NPs treated rats showed a 2.9
fold greater maximum platinum concentration and CoFA-NPs produced 3.19 times greater in comparison to rats
treated with free-CDDP (AUC). MRT for CDDP-loaded
NPs is around 1.8 times and Co-FA-NPs is around 2.1
times greater in comparison to free-CDDP. The greater

AUC and MRT values for CDDP-loaded NPs and CoFA-NPs, as compared to free-CDDP, are associated with
greater bioavailability of these formulations for systematic
circulation. The t1/2 of CDDP-loaded NPs is 1.75 times
and Co-FA-NPs is 2.08 times greater in comparison to
free-CDDP. The Vd,ss of CDDP-loaded NPs and Co-FANPs is also slightly higher than free-CDDP. The bodily
clearance of free-CDDP of the rats is 2.46 times greater in
comparison to CDDP-loaded NPs and 2.65 times greater
in comparison to Co-FA-NPs. The rule is similar for PTX.
AUC, MRT, and t1/2 for Co-FA-NPs is, respectively, 1.61,

1.55 and 1.60 times greater in comparison to PTX-loaded
NPs while CL is 1.48 times less in comparison to PTXloaded NPs. These pharmacokinetic parameters predict
that CDDP-loaded NPs, PTX-loaded NPs, and Co-FA-NPs
promoted stability and prolonged circulation of CDDP and
PTX. Decreased stability and circulation time of drugloaded NPs, in comparison to Co-FA-NPs, is directly
related to the faster in vitro release rate.

ligand and receptor in the M109 cells surface.
Free-CDDP are mainly distributed in the blood,
kidneys, liver, and spleen, with secondary distribution in
the small intestine, bone marrow, and tumor. Free-PTX
is primarily dispersed in the blood, liver and spleen, with
secondary distribution in the kidneys, tumor, and small
intestine. The CDDP and PTX in Co-NPs are mainly
dispersed to the blood, liver, and spleen, and bone marrow,
followed by secondary distribution in the kidney and
tumor. The CDDP and PTX in Co-FA-NPs are mainly
dispersed to the blood, liver, spleen, and tumor, followed
by secondary distribution in the kidney and bone marrow.
Compared with free-CDDP and free-PTX, co-delivery
NPs have a greater tendency to distribute in the liver,
spleen, bone marrow and tumor, mononuclear phagocyte
system(MPS), and the circulating time in the blood was
significantly longer than that of single free-CDDP and
single free-PTX form. This conforms to the distribution
characteristics of stealth NPs. Meantime, the blood drug
concentration from stealth NPs was reduced slower and
NPs can be gathered by EPR effect in tumor which is
beneficial to tumor treatment. At the same time, the NPs
produce a barrier effect between the chemotherapeutic
drugs and the tissues of the body avoid direct contact. In
addition, the slow release effect of NPs can significantly
reduce the side effects of chemotherapeutic drugs. The
CDDP and PTX in the co-delivery NPs have the same
distribution and pharmacokinetic characteristics which is
also beneficial for enhancement of the synergistic effects
between the two kinds of chemotherapeutic drugs.

The biodistribution of CDDP and PTX, up to 24
hours (5, 15 and 30 min, 1, 3, 5, 10 and 24 h) following
administration in Co-FA-NPs, is shown in Figure 7.
According to Figure 7, the concentration of CDDP and
PTX, in most organs, decreased over the 24 hour period.
The destabilization of co-delivery NPs in the blood
compartment initiated the release of CDDP and PTX in
the bloodstream. In Co-NPs, the drug was then rapidly
cleared through the kidneys where a relatively high level
of CDDP was detected (0.82 to 2.64% ID/g), and the PTX
was 0.54 to 2.22% ID/g. For Co-FA-NPs, the relatively
level of CDDP was 0.58 to 2.23% ID/g, and the PTX was
0.56 to 2.14% ID/g. This was especially true when freeCDDP was measured within the first 15 min post-injection
(2.86±0.34% ID/g), and the free-PTX was 1.13±0.14%
ID/g. In addition, there were relatively high amounts of
CDDP and PTX in Co-FA-NPs measured in the liver
(1.2 to 4.2% ID/g) and (1.3 to 4.8% ID/g), respectively.
When CDDP and PTX was measured in the spleen, the
results were (0.77 to 3.13% ID/g) and (0.69 to 3.7%
ID/g), respectively. This is expected because NPs typically
accumulate in organs of the mononuclear phagocyte
system (MPS). Moreover, at 24 h, CDDP (2.34% ID/g),
PTX (2.78% ID/g) in Co-NPs and CDDP (2.92% ID/g),
PTX (3.54% ID/g) in Co-FA-NPs within the blood were
significantly higher than free-CDDP (1.05% ID/g) and
free-PTX (0.53% ID/g) (p < 0.01). It indicated that the
NPs have good stability and long circulation properties.
In the M109 tumor tissues, at 5 h, CDDP (2.34%
ID/g) and PTX (2.46% ID/g) in Co-FA-NPs were
significantly higher than Co-NPs (CDDP: 1.52%
ID/g; PTX: 1.67% ID/g) (p < 0.05). In addition, CoNPs were significantly higher than free-CDDP (0.61%
ID/g) and free-PTX (0.53% ID/g) (p < 0.01). Up to 24
h, the differences were further enlarged, CDDP (1.68%
ID/g) and PTX (2.27% ID/g) in the Co-FA-NPs groups
were significantly higher than Co-NPs (CDDP: 0.63%
ID/g; PTX: 0.84% ID/g) (p < 0.01). Co-NPs were also
significantly higher than free-CDDP (0.14% ID/g) and
free-PTX (0.11% ID/g) (p < 0.01).
The T/NT (tumor/muscle) was similarly distributed.
At 5 h, the T/NT (CDDP: 16.71; PTX: 6.67) in Co-FANPs was obviously higher than Co-NPs (CDDP: 4.90;
PTX: 4.39). Co-NPs were significantly higher than freeCDDP (2.44) and free-PTX (2.21) (p < 0.05). Up to 24
h, the differences were further enlarged, and the T/NT
(CDDP: 24; PTX: 18.92) in Co-FA-NPs was significantly
higher than Co-NPs (CDDP: 4.85; PTX: 6.4) (p < 0.01). In
addition, Co-NPs were also significantly higher than freeCDDP (1.27) and free-PTX (1.38) (p < 0.01).
These demonstrated that the Co-FA-NPs have better
targeting for M109 cell grafted tumors than Co-NPs and
free drugs. It may be related to the specific binding of

In vivo antitumor efficiency
Based on the above results, the in vivo anticancer
activity and systemic toxicity of the dual-drug loaded
NPs were further investigated on M109 and A549 lung
cancer cell grafted tumor-bearing nude mice. Mice were
treated with PBS, free drug, drug-loaded NPs, and codelivery NPs, respectively. The mice were injected every
four days via intravenous injection, and tumor volumes
and body weights were measured every two days. As
shown in Figure 8, in comparison with the rapid tumor
growth of PBS treatment group, all the drug formulations
showed efficacy in inhibiting the tumor growth to different
degrees. For the free drugs and the drug-loaded NPs
treated groups, five conclusions could be summarized
as follows: (1) the free-drug was effective for tumortreatment. The combination of CDDP and PTX was more
effective than the use of single drug. (2) In the A549 cells
mice, for the same drugs, the loaded-drug NPs-treated
mice showed less tumor volume compared with free-drug.
The free drug combination treated mice have less tumor
volume than single loaded-drug NPs-treated mice, and the
difference was statistically significant. The best antitumor
activity was observed in the Co-FA-NPs treated group
42160

Oncotarget

which revealed the greatest inhibition of tumor growth.
The tumor volume of Co-FA-NPs treated group was only
10.04% of control group at the end of experiment which
was 3.78-fold, 5.07-fold, 1.29-fold and 1.87-fold smaller
than that treated with free-CDDP, free-PTX, Co-NPs and
free-CDDP + free-PTX, respectively.[2, 8, 10] In addition,
there was no significant difference between Co-FA-NPs
and Co-NPs treatment groups. (3) In the M109 cells mice,
for the same drugs, the loaded-drug NPs-treated mice
showed significantly less tumor volume in comparison
to the free-drug treated mice (p < 0.05). The free drug
combination treated mice have similar tumor volume when
compared with single loaded-drug NPs-treated mice. The
best antitumor activity was observed in the Co-FA-NPs
treated group which exhibited almost complete inhibition
of tumor growth and no obvious tumor recrudescence
throughout treatment. The tumor volume of Co-FA-NPs
treated group was only 4.97% of control group at the end
of experiment, which was 7.36-fold, 10.08-fold and 4.38fold smaller than that treated with free-CDDP, free-PTX,
and free-CDDP + free-PTX, respectively. (4) In M109

cells grafted mice, the antitumor efficacy of Co-FA-NPs
was better than that of Co-NPs treated grafted mice (p
< 0.05). (5) According to the tumor relative growth rate
(tumor volume of treated groups/control), the antitumor
efficacy of Co-FA-NPs for M109 cells grafted mice was
better than that in A549 cells grafted mice (p < 0.05).
The superior antitumor effect of Co-FA-NPs could be
attributed to the targeting, the enhanced nanoparticles
stability during the blood circulation, the sufficient and
coinstantaneous delivery of two drugs to the tumor site, the
efficient cellular uptake in the tumor, and the synergistic
effect of CDDP and PTX on tumor inhibition. [40]
Alteration of body weight is an indication of
systemic toxicity. As depicted in Figure 8, in A549 cells
grafted mice, the body weights of PBS, free-CDDP, freePTX, CDDP-FA-NPs and PTX-FA-NPs treated mice
showed a continuous and slow increase, which could
be attributed to the tumor growth and low toxicity of
chemotherapy at injection dosage. Obvious weight loss
(about 15%) was observed in mice treated with free-CDDP
and free-PTX co-administration. This enhanced toxicity

of free drug combination limited the success of clinical
combination chemotherapy. On the contrary, the treatment
with co-delivery NPs did not lead to any significant body
weight loss which reflects reduced systemic toxicity of
the loaded drugs and no tumor growth. These effects have
provided more options for enlargement of the therapeutic
window. [41]
In M109 cells grafted mice, the body weights of
PBS, free-CDDP, and free-PTX treated mice also showed
a continuous and slow increase. In free-CDDP + free-PTX
treated M109 cells grafted mice, similar weight loss was
observed in comparison with A549 cells grafted mice. In
addition, the treatment with CDDP-FA-NPs, PTX-FANPs and co-delivery NPs did not lead to any significant
alteration of body weight.
The good in vivo performance (enhanced anti-tumor
efficiency and lowered systemic toxicity) of the PTX +

CDDP co-delivery NPs can be explained by the following
reasons: (1) the inherent long circulation and EPR effect
of stealth NPs would passively/actively accumulate the
NPs at the tumor site; (2) the drugs cross-linking shell
effectively protected the CDDP and PTX in the core
domains against rapid clearance during blood circulation
while quickly released the carriers in the tumor acidic
condition; (3) the synergistic effect of the two drugs in the
co-delivery NPs resulted in better tumor inhibition effect;
(4) because of the sustained release behavior, the delivery
system showed a continued tumor inhibition effect
throughout the 12 day treatment period and the continued
inhibition was observed until the mice were sacrificed
following the last drug administration. [2, 8, 10] Based
on the above results, with the high antitumor efficacy
and the low drug-related toxicity, we conclude that the
amphiphilic copolymer (FA/PEG-PLGA) co-delivery

CDDP + PTX strategy provides a promising solution for
cancer chemotherapy. For the tumor with folate receptor
positive, Co-FA-NPs showed more surprising anti-tumor
effects.
The principle of drug combination is to achieve
efficient antitumor effect with minimal side-effects at
lower drug doses. Therefore, our next goal is to reduce
drug doses to obtain the maximal therapeutic effect and
further reduce side effects.

components are primarily dependent on the administration
of drug form. In treating the free-CDDP + free-PTX
group, there were remarkable decreases observed for
white blood cells (WBC) and neutrophils when compared
with control (p < 0.05). In addition, there was an obvious
increase in ALT, AST, serum creatinine, and BUN
observed when compared with control (p < 0.05). These
changes indicate that although the combination of freeCDDP + free-PTX has anti-tumor capabilities, they also
have the potential to cause blood toxicity and liver and
kidney function damage. The single free-CDDP and single
free-PTX induces a slight increase of serum creatinine,
BUN, ALT and AST, but did not differ significantly
when compared with control. While the drug-loaded NPs
remained constant when the formulations were given via
injection through the tail vein, this indicates the NPs can
enhance the anti-tumor effect of chemotherapeutic drugs.
In addition, the NPs may decrease the toxicity and sideeffects of chemotherapeutic drugs. Through the use of the
co-delivery system, we can further enhance the synergistic
effect of chemotherapeutic drugs and simultaneously
decrease unwanted side-effects.

Histological analysis
To further investigate the side-effects of Co-FANPs, nude mice afflicted with tumors were euthanized and
the heart, liver, spleen, lung and kidneys were dissected
and stained with H&E for post-mortem analysis. The data
of PBS, free-CDDP, free-PTX, CDDP-FA-NPs, PTX-FANPs, Co-NPs, Co-FA-NPs and free-CDDP + free-PTX
treated groups are shown in Figure 9. For H&E staining,
the normal cells were found to contain large nuclei with
spherical or spindle shape and contained greater levels
of chromatin. In comparison, the necrotic cells failed to
maintain an adequate cell morphology and the chromatin
changed and appeared to become smaller, pyknotic, or
non-existent inside the cell. As shown in Figure 9, the
organ cells with normal shape and more chromatin were
observed in the PBS, CDDP-FA-NPs, PTX-FA-NPs, CoNPs and Co-FA-NPs group and exhibited no obvious
damage to organs which indicates few side-effects and a
vigorous cell state. This is consistent with the body weight
change result in Figure 8. However, the various degrees of
liver/kidney tissue necrosis were observed in free-CDDP,
free-PTX, and free-CDDP + free-PTX treated groups.
Free-CDDP caused slight damage to the kidneys and freePTX caused obvious damage to the liver. Free-PTX + freeCDDP caused severe damage to liver and kidneys. The
free-CDDP + free-PTX treated group had large necrotic
areas as compared with the groups treated with freeCDDP and free-PTX, which indicates that most liver and
kidney cells were necrotic in the free-CDDP + free-PTX
treated group. Together, this data clearly confirms that the
level of necrosis and apoptosis, in liver and kidney tissue
treated with co-delivery NPs, was significantly lower than
that treated with free-CDDP + free-PTX. This, therefore,
demonstrates that co-delivery NPs enhance the synergistic
anti-tumor effect of CDDP and PTX in addition to
reducing unwanted side effects.

medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100
μg/mL streptomycin and 100 U/mL penicillin at 37 °C
under 5% CO2. [11, 12, 13, 14]

(20 mg) and PTX (0.5, 1 or 2 mg) dissolved in 1 mL of
ethyl acetate, mixed with 0.1 mL of CDDP solution (10
mg/mL). The mixture was then sonicated for 1 min. Then,
50 μL of emulsion was added into 3.9 mL of stirring
F68 solution (1%, w/w), and once again emulsified by
sonication. The subsequent steps were the same as the
preparation of CDDP-FA-NPs.

Synthesis of the FA-PEG-PLGA polymer
The synthesis of FA-PEG-PLGA polymer (Mw
12,000) was, as with the previous literatures, with
minor modifications. [15, 16, 17] In brief; (1) the
hydroxyl-terminated PEG-PLGA was synthesized; (2)
the hydroxyl end-group converted to Boc-L-Phe; (3) the
t-Butoxycarbonyl end-group was removed and synthesis
amino-terminated PEG-PLGA; (4) amino-terminated
PEG-PLGA (200 μmol) was dissolved in DMSO (60 mL),
then mixed with NHS (1,000 μmol), DIC (1,000 μmol)
and folic acid (500 μmol) at 37˚C. After 24 hours, the
solution was mixed with 200 mL of distilled water and
then centrifuged at 2,500×g. After discarding the sediment,
the supernatant was dialyzed and freeze-dried. The
concentration of conjugated folic acid was determined at
365 nm (UV absorbance value) after the obtained product
was dissolved in DMSO. [16] Different concentrations of
folic acid in DMSO were used as reference.

Physical characterization of NPs
The size and zeta potential of the NPs were
characterized using a ZetaSizer Nano ZS (Malvern
Instruments Ltd., UK). The size profiles of the NPs were
determined by dynamic light scattering (DLS). The zeta
potential (ζ) was determined through a He-Ne laser beam
with a wavelength of 633.8 nm at 25˚C. Three batches
of samples were analyzed. The morphology of NPs
was observed with a JEM-1400 transmission electron
microscope (TEM) (JEOL, Japan). [19, 20]

Stability study and in vitro drug release assay
The phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (0.1 M, pH
5.0, 7.4 or 9.1), 5% FBS and 2% BSA solution with
100 μg/mL streptomycin and 100 U/mL penicillin were
prepared and filtered.
A total of 5 mg of NPs were suspended in 15 mL of
5% FBS, 2% BSA or PBS with continuous stirring under
128 rpm at 37˚C. The sizes of NPs were detected at 0, 1,
2, 3, and 5 days in order to determine the stability of the
NPs by DLS. [21, 22]
For in vitro drugs release assay, 20 mg of CDDPFA-NPs, PTX-FA-NPs, Co-FA-NPs, or Co-NPs were resuspended in 8 mL of 5% FBS, 2% BSA or PBS containing
F68 (1%, w/w) and transferred to dialysis bags. [23, 24]
Then, the NPs were placed in 60 mL of 5% FBS, 2%
BSA or PBS containing F68 (1%, w/w) with continuous
stirring under 128 rpm at 37˚C. At a predetermined time
point, the medium was replaced with fresh medium.
The taken medium were mixed with methanol to
precipitate the unneeded protein, centrifuged, and the
supernatant was assayed using a high performance liquid
chromatography (HPLC) to determine the concentration
of the released CDDP and PTX in the medium. The
accumulative percentage of the released CDDP and PTX
was determined according to the calibration curve. Serially
diluted concentrations of CDDP and PTX standard were
used to construct the calibration curve. An Agilent 1200
series UV detector and chemstation system were used at
25˚C.
CDDP was determined using an Eclipse XDB-C18
column (150 × 4.6 mm, 5 μm) at 25˚C. The flow rate
of the mobile phase (methanol: 0.9% sodium chloride
solution = 80: 20, v/v) was 1 mL/min and the UV detector
wavelength was 310 nm. A sample volume of 20 μL was

Preparation of the FA-PEG-PLGA NPs (blank
NPs), CDDP-FA-PEG-PLGA NPs (CDDP-FANPs), PTX-FA-PEG-PLGA NPs (PTX-FA-NPs),
Co-FA-NPs, and CDDP-PTX-PEG-PLGA NPs
(Co-NPs)
The blank NPs and CDDP-FA-NPs were prepared
by the double emulsion (W/O/W) method with a little
modification as described by Wang, et al. [18] In brief,
the CDDP solution (1.0 mg in 100 μL solution consisting
of water and DMSO (3/2, v/v)) or 100 μL of distilled
water was emulsified in FA-PEG-PLGA solution (20
mg in 1,000 μL of ethyl acetate by sonication (400 W,
10 s × 6 times) (JY 92-II ultrasonic processor; Ningbo
Scientz Biotechnology Co., Ltd., China). Subsequently,
the emulsion was added to 10.0 mL of F68 solution (1%,
w/w) and sonicated again (400 W, 10 s × 8 times). After
being rotated and evaporated, the solution was centrifuged
for 30 min at 15,000 rpm under 4˚C. Finally, the collected
NPs were washed twice using distilled water and freezedried. [2, 10]
PTX-FA-NPs were prepared using an emulsion/
solvent evaporation method. A solution of 5 mg of FAPEG-PLGA and 0.25 mg of PTX was dissolved in 0.25
mL of ethyl acetate. Then, the mixture was added into
10.0 mL of F68 solution (1%, w/w), and emulsified by
sonication. The subsequent steps were identical to the
preparation of CDDP-FA-NPs.
Co-NPs and Co-FA-NPs was produced by the
improved double emulsion technique. In brief, copolymer

injected into HPLC column for each analysis.
For PTX, the mobile phase was water/acetonitrile
(1:1, v/v) and the test wavelength was 227 nm. The other
conditions were identical with the detection of CDDP.
Drug loading efficiency (DLE, wt%) of the NPs was
determined as the equation:
DLE = (weight of loaded drug/total weight of drug)
× 100%.
Drug loading content (DLC, wt%) of the NPs was
determined as the equation: DLC = (weight of loaded
drug/weight of drug-loaded NPs) × 100%.

The A549 and M109 cells (1×106 cells, 0.1 mL in
PBS) were subcutaneously transplanted into the right
flank of male Balb-c/nude mice, respectively. When the
tumor volume was approximately 50-70 mm3 and 30-50
mm3, the biodistribution study and treatment was initiated,
respectively (n = 6).
In the biodistribution study, M109 lung cancer cell
grafted, tumor-bearing, nude mice were injected freeCDDP (5 mg/kg), free-PTX (12 mg/kg), Co-NPs (CDDP:
PTX = 1:2) or Co-FA-NPs (CDDP: PTX = 1:2) via tail
vein. At predetermined time intervals (5, 15, 30 min and
1, 3, 5, 10, and 24 h), mice were sacrificed via cardiac
puncture under diethyl ether anesthesia. Liver, spleen,
muscle, bone marrow, kidney, small intestine, blood, and
tumor were collected, washed with PBS, and weighed.
The plasma and homogenized organs were mixed with
methanol to precipitate the unneeded protein, centrifuged,
and the supernatant was detected by HPLC analysis.
In the antitumor activity experiment, mice were
treated with PBS, free-PTX (1.2 mg/kg), free-CDDP (0.5
mg/kg), CDDP-FA-NPs (equivalent to 0.5 mg CDDP/kg),
PTX-FA-NPs (equivalent to 1.2 mg PTX/kg), Co-FA-NPs
(CDDP: PTX = 1:2, DLC equivalent to CDDP of 0.5mg/
kg and PTX of 1.2 mg/kg), Co-NPs (CDDP: PTX = 1:2,
DLC closely equivalent to CDDP of 0.5mg/kg and PTX of
1.2 mg/kg, the total drugs were 1.7 mg/kg) and free-CDDP
+ free-PTX (equivalent to 0.5 mg CDDP/kg and 1.2 mg
PTX/kg) intravenously via tail vein on days 0, 4, 8, and
12. The tumor volume and the body weight were evaluated
every two days to determine the antitumor activities and
the side effects. The estimated tumor volume (mm3) was
calculated according to the formulations: V = a·b2/2 (a and
b was the longest and shortest diameter, respectively). At
day 18, mice were sacrificed. [29] Approximately 200 μL
of blood was collected with microtubes (pretreated with
heparin) to detect the blood component change and to
evaluate for any potential systematic toxicology.

Cytotoxicity in vitro
Cells were cultured in 96-well plates with 100 μL
of DMEM medium (10% FBS, 100 μg/mL streptomycin,
and 100 U/mL penicillin) in the incubator until the cells
adhered. Then, the medium was replaced with 200 μL of
DMEM medium containing blank NPs (equal to the FAPEG-PLGA concentration in the Co-FA-NPs (CDDP:PTX
= 1:1)), free-CDDP, free-PTX, CDDP-FA-NPs, PTX-FANPs, Co-NPs, Co-FA-NPs or free-CDDP + free-PTX.
DMEM medium was used as control. The total drug
content, in all the test groups, was constant at 10.0 μg/mL.
After 24 hours, the relative growth rate (RGR) of cells
was determined via a CCK-8 assay as instruction. [25, 26]

Pharmacokinetic analysis
Before the pharmacokinetic experiment, the
kunming mice were fasted for at least 8 hours and water
was given ad libitum. These mice were divided into
a number of experimental groups at random. Group I
received free-CDDP (5 mg/kg), Group II received freePTX (12 mg/kg), Group III received CDDP-FA-NPs
(CDDP equivalent to 5 mg/kg), Group IV received PTXFA-NPs (PTX equivalent to 12 mg/kg), and Group V
received Co-FA-NPs (equivalent to CDDP of 5mg/kg and
PTX of 12 mg/kg) via tail vein. At predetermined time
intervals (5, 15, 30 min and 1, 3, 5, 10, and 24 h), mice
were sacrificed via cardiac puncture under diethyl ether
anesthesia. A sample of 0.2 mL of blood was collected
into tubes containing heparin and centrifuged for 15 min at
2,500×g under 4˚C to obtain plasma. The pharmacokinetic
parameters which terminal half-life (t1/2), area under the
curve from time 0 h to 24 h (AUC24h), mean residence
time (MRT), total body clearance (CL), and volume of
distribution at steady state (Vd, ss) were calculated by noncompartmental analysis using WinNonlinTM (Pharsight

On day 18, mice were anesthetized and the
chests were excised open. To evaluate for any potential
systematic toxicology, approximately 20 μL of blood was
collected from the heart via the use of the plastic syringe
that was pre-treated with15 mM EDTA. The number of
blood cells present in whole blood was calculated by the
using an Auto-analyzer (XT-1800i, Sysmex Corporation,
Japan). A second blood sample (around 150 μL) was
collected from the heart via the use of a plastic syringe that
was pre-treated with heparin sodium (10 IU). Plasma was
obtained by centrifuging the blood sample at 3,000 rpm for

20 min. The concentrations of aspartate aminotransferase
(AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), serum creatinine
(Scr), and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) were calculated with
the use of a Biochemical Auto-analyzer (7170S, Hitachi,
Japan). [30, 31]
The heart, liver, spleen, lung, and kidney
were collected, fixed immediately in 4% buffered
paraformaldehyde for 12 hours, and embedded in
paraffin block. Then, the paraffin block was sliced at 5μm
thickness using a Leitz model 1512 microtome. Then, the
5μm paraffin slices were stained with hematoxylin-eosin
(H&E). Finally, these finished slices were observed using
a light microscope and the representative graphs were
saved.

CONCLUSIONS
We present an FA modified amphiphilic copolymerbased CDDP and PTX combination strategy for greater
chemotherapeutic response and lessened side-effects.
Core-shell-corona particles were obtained by entrapping
CDDP and PTX in the FA-PEG-PLGA diblock copolymer.
The resultant dual-drug-loaded particles showed to work
in synergy to promote the inhibition of the proliferation
of A549 and M109 lung cancer cells. An in vivo study
showed that the FA modified amphiphilic copolymerbased combination of PTX and CDDP displayed greater
inhibition toward A549 and M109 tumor growth than
free drug combinations, with less unpleasant side effects.
In addition, FA modified amphiphilic copolymer-based
combination of PTX and CDDP showed greater anti-tumor
effects for M109 tumor with folic acid receptor positive
than that for A549 tumor with folic acid receptor negative.
Therefore, this system could be highly beneficial for
cancer chemotherapy. In particular, this drug combination
could be especially useful for treatment of tumors with
folate receptor positive.
