Abstract
HER2þ breast cancer is currently treated with chemotherapy plus anti-HER2 inhibitors. Many patients do not
respond or relapse with aggressive metastatic disease. Therefore, there is an urgent need for new therapeutics that
can target HER2þ breast cancer and potentiate the effect of anti-HER2 inhibitors, in particular those that can
target tumor-initiating cells (TIC). Here, we show that MMTV-Her2/Neu mammary tumor cells cultured as
nonadherent spheres or as adherent monolayer cells select for stabilizing mutations in p53 that "immortalize"
the cultures and that, after serial passages, sphere conditions maintain TICs, whereas monolayer cells gradually
lose these tumorigenic cells. Using tumorsphere formation as surrogate for TICs, we screened p53-mutant
Her2/Neuþ tumorsphere versus monolayer cells with a lentivirus short hairpin RNA kinome library. We identiﬁed
kinases such as the mitogen-activated protein kinase and the TGFbR protein family, previously implicated
in HER2þ breast cancer, as well as autophagy factor ATG1/ULK1 and the noncanonical IkB kinase (IKK),
TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1), which have not been previously linked to HER2þ breast cancer. Knockdown of
TBK1 or pharmacologic inhibition of TBK1 and the related protein, IKKe, suppressed growth of both mouse
and human HER2þ breast cancer cells. TBK1/IKKe inhibition promoted cellular senescence by suppressing
p65–NF-kB and inducing p16Ink4a. In addition, TBK1/IKKe inhibition cooperated with lapatinib, a HER2/
EGFR1–targeted drug, to accelerate apoptosis and kill HER2þ breast cancer cells both in culture and in xenografts. Our results suggest that patients with HER2þ breast cancer may beneﬁt from anti-TBK1/IKKe plus antiHER2 combination therapies and establish conditions that can be used to screen for additional TIC-speciﬁc
inhibitors of HER2þ breast cancer. Cancer Res; 74(7); 2119–30. 2014 AACR.

Introduction
HER2þ beast cancer is caused by overexpression/ampliﬁcation of the HER2/ERBB2/NEU receptor tyrosine kinase and
represent approximately 20% of breast tumors (1). About 72%
of HER2þ breast cancers contain mutations or deletions in
the tumor suppressor p53 (2). Patients with HER2þ breast
cancer are treated with chemotherapy plus anti-HER2 inhibi-

tors such as trastuzumab, a monoclonal antibody (mAb) directed against HER2 (3–6). Despite improvement in diseasefree survival, adverse effects and emergence of drug-resistant
metastases represent serious limitations. There is, therefore,
an urgent need to identify novel drugs that can cooperate with
anti-HER therapy to effectively kill HER2þ breast cancer.
Many cancer types exhibit hierarchical organization,
whereby only a subset of tumor cells, termed tumor-initiating cells (TIC), sustains cancer growth (7, 8). These cells
are functionally deﬁned by their ability to induce secondary
tumors following transplantation into recipient mice, and in
certain cases by their ability to grow as spheres under
nonadherent conditions (9, 10). In contrast, the tumor bulk
comprises non-TICs, which descended from TICs but show
reduced tumorigenic potential. TICs exhibit unique sensitivity to radiation and therapeutic drugs relative to non-TICs
(11–13). Indeed, following conventional therapy, residual
breast cancers are enriched for TICs (14). It was, therefore,
suggested that therapeutic drugs should target TICs. However, there is also evidence that non-TICs can revert, albeit at
low frequency, back to TICs (8) and, therefore, curative
therapeutic regimens should target both compartments.
The identiﬁcation of effective therapeutics is hindered by
difﬁculty in obtaining primary tumor samples. One approach
to circumvent this problem involves mouse models for speciﬁc

subtypes. Bill Muller's group has developed a mouse model for
HER2þ breast cancer, MMTV-Her2/Neu (15), which has been
successfully used to dissect genetic dependencies and pathways involved in metastatic dissemination (16, 17). This model
was also used to identify TICs and tumorsphere-forming units
(TFU; refs. 9, 18), and to generate a powerful prognostic
signature for HER2þ breast cancer (19), demonstrating its
utility in modeling the human disease. Here, we show that
following several passages of Her2/Neu tumor cells as adherent
or nonadherent cells, they become enriched for p53 mutations,
and that tumorsphere but not monolayer cells maintain TICs.
We then used these p53-mutant Her2þ tumor cells to screen
for kinases that are essential for HER2þ breast cancer. The
screen identiﬁed TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) as essential.
Genetic and pharmacologic inhibition of TBK1, and its close
relative IKKe, either alone or together with the anti-EGFR/
HER2 inhibitor, lapatinib, suppressed growth of human HER2þ
breast cancer cell in vitro and in vivo. Our results identify TBK1/
IKKe as novel therapeutic target for HER2þ breast cancer.

Materials and Methods
Animals, tumorspheres, and cell culture
MMTV-Her2/Neu mice on pure FvB background were maintained as per University Health Network (UHN) Animal Care
Committee Guideline. Of note, 0.5- to 1-cm mammary tumors
were minced and digested with 100 U/mL collagenase/hyaluronidase (STEMCELL Technologies) for 60 minutes at 37 C.
Following negative selection with the EasySep Kit (STEMCELL
Technologies), enriched Lin mammary epithelial cells were
plated onto ultra-low attachment 24-well plates (Corning,
Costar) in Dulbecco's Modiﬁed Eagle Medium (DMEM)/F-12
HAM medium containing basic ﬁbroblast growth factor
(bFGF), EGF, and B-27 supplement as described previously
(9, 20) or onto regular plates with DMEM plus 10% FBS for
monolayer cell cultures. HER2þ breast cancer cell lines—
HCC1954 (American Type Culture Collection, ATCC; CRL2338), SKBR3 (ATCC; HTB-30), and JIMT1 (DSMZ; # ACC589)—were obtained from Dr. Tak W. Mak, UHN (Toronto,
Ontario, Canada), and were not further authenticated. Upon
receiving, cells were expanded, frozen, and fresh aliquots were
used for experiments. HCC1954, SKBR3, and JIMT1 were
cultured, respectively, in RPMI, McCoys 5A, and DMEM plus
10% FBS, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 mg/mL streptomycin.
HC11 mammary epithelial cells were cultured in RPMI-1640
plus 10%FBS, EGF, and insulin; and 293T cells in low-antibiotic
(0.1XPen/Strep) DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS.
Mouse short hairpin RNA kinase library (TRC1) and Tbk1
shRNA clones
A subset of the Broad Institute RNAi Consortium (TRC)
pLKO.1 short hairpin RNA (shRNA) library targeting 520 mouse
kinase genes with 2,567 lentiviral clones (4–5 shRNAs/gene)
were used for screens in a total of 28-  96-well plates (21). Each
plate included 3 to 5 wells with empty vector (Lenti-GFP) as
negative controls. shRNA clones TRCN 0000003182 and 3185
targeting human Tbk1 were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich;
lenti-Scrambled shRNA was used as negative control. For
constructing inducible Tbk1 shRNA vector, Tbk1 shRNA pri-

particles were produced by transfection of 293T cells with
pLKO.1 shRNA vector together with packaging plasmids using
TransIT-LT1(Mirus Bio; MIR2300).
Lentiviral shRNA screens
Brieﬂy, on day 0, 500 Neu monolayer cells were seeded
onto 96-well plates. On day 1, 100 mL fresh DMEM containing
8 mg/mL polybrene was added to each well. In parallel, 500
tumorsphere cells were seeded per well onto ultra-low attachment 96-well plates with 100 mL DMEM/F-12 HAM medium
containing bFGF, EGF, B-27, and polybrene at 8 mg/mL. TRC1
shRNA library plates for each experiment were thawed at room
temperature and aliquots of 10 mL lentivirus-shRNA were
transferred to each well via Rapidplate 96/384 Station (Caliperlifescience). Of note, 2 to 3 shRNA library plates were
screened in each experiment (28 plates total). On day 3,
medium was gently aspirated and replaced with 200 mL fresh
medium. On day 7, tumorsphere counts and MTT assays were
carried out (20).
Transplantation
Dissociated tumorsphere, monolayer, or HCC1954 cells were
resuspended in 20 mL DMEM/F-12 HAM medium and Matrigel
(BD Biosciences; 1:1 ratio) and injected into number 4 mammary glands of FvB or NOD/SCID mice.
Antibodies
We used Rabbit mAb (Cat.#04-856) for Tbk1 (Upstate;
Millipore); mouse anti-Bcl-xL (Cat.# 610746) and mouse
anti-CASK (Cat.# 610782) from BD Biosciences; mouse antip16ink4a (sc-1661), goat anti-Stk25 (sc-6865), and rabbit antiAcvr2b (sc-25453) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology; rabbit
mAb to NF-kB p65 (Cat.# 8242), rabbit mAb to phosphoSer536-NF-kB p65 (Cat.# 3033), and mAb to p53 from Cell
Signaling Technology; anti-Atg1/ULK1 antibody (A7481) and
monoclonal anti-Camk2d (WH00008177) and rabbit antiTGFbR1 (SAB13001113) from Sigma.
TBK compound II and other drugs
Details about synthesis/puriﬁcation of TBK1-II are available upon request. Inhibitors for Tbk1 (BX-795; Axon Medchem BV); CaM kinase II (KN-62; EMD Chemicals); TGFbR1
(SB505124, SIS3), 3-Methyladenine (3-MA), chloroquine, and
lapatinib were from Sigma. 3-MA dissolved in water at room
temperature, was placed at 65 C for 5 minutes before using.
All other compounds were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO) and stored at 20 C at stock concentration of

Anti-CD49f (allophycocyanin) and anti-CD24 (FITC) were from
BD Biosciences. Flow cytometry analysis was performed on
FACSCalibur (Becton Dickinson).
Senescence-associated b-galactosidase (X-gal)
staining
After TBK1-II treatment or infection with lenti-shRNATbk1
for 72 hours, cells were washed twice with PBS, ﬁxed in 3%
formaldehyde (Sigma), and stained with X-gal solution (1
mg/mL X-gal, 40 mmol/L citric acid, 5 mmol/L potassium
ferrocyanide, 150 mmol/L NaCl, and 2 mmol/L MgCl2)
overnight in a CO2 incubator at 37 C. b-Galactosidase–
positive cells were counted using a phase contrast microscope and were expressed as a percentage of total number of
cells.
Microarray analysis
Microarray analysis was performed at the UHN Microarray Centre using Illumina HumanHT-12 v4 BeadChip
with 500 ng of total RNA prepared by the RNeasy Mini Kit
(Qiagen; Cat. no. 74104) from TBK1-II–treated versus untreated HCC1954 cells (GEO accession number GSE53658). Microarray data were processed and normalized by "lumi" package
from BioConductor in R using the quantile method. Statistical
differences between samples were calculated by Bayesian
statistic using "limma" package from BioConductor in R to
obtain moderated T value for subsequent pathway analysis.

Pharmacokinetic analysis of TBK1
TBK1-II (OICR7680) was administered at 3 mg/kg i.v. and
30 mg/kg i.p. to mice. Blood samples were collected into micro
tubes (EDTA) from 3 mice each through the saphenous vein at
the following time points for all three groups: 5, 15, and 30
minutes, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 24 hours. Plasma was separated from
blood by centrifugation at 3,000 rpm (1,620  g) for 10 minutes
at 4 C, transferred into Eppendorf tubes, immediately placed
on dry ice and stored at 80 C pending ultra performance liquid
chromatography (UPLC) and mass spectrometric analysis. A
waters acquity UPLC coupled with Xevo QTof mass spectrometer was used, and data analyzed with WinNonlin software.
Statistical analysis
All data are presented as means  SD. Two-tailed distribution Student t tests were carried out with P values of 0.05
considered statistically signiﬁcant.

Results
p53 mutation and frequency of TICs in long-term Her2/
Neuþ tumorsphere versus adherent cultures
To establish conditions for high-content lentivirus screens,
primary MMTV-Her2/Neu tumors were dissociated and cultured in ultra-low attachment plates in minimal media containing EGF and bFGF (9). Under these conditions and at early
passage, MMTV-Her2/Neu tumor cells formed tumorspheres
that seemed encapsulated (Fig. 1A). After 3 to 4 passages, about
50% of sphere cultures became "immortalized" with spheres

becoming more retractile with uneven boundaries, resembling
MMTV-Wnt1 tumorspheres (Fig. 1A; ref. 9). Similarly, earlypassage MMTV-Her2/Neu-adherent cells, cultured in 10%
serum, were enlarged and grew slowly; after 3 to 4 passages,
about 50% of cultures became "immortalized" with epitheliallike cuboidal cells (Fig. 1B). Following transplantation of
immortalized tumorsphere or monolayer cells into recipient
mice, the resulting tumors exhibited robust nuclear staining of
p53, indicative of stabilizing mutations (Fig. 1C; ref. 23). Loss of
p53 is in accord with the observation that approximately 37%
of MMTV-Her2/Neu tumors acquire missense mutations in
p53 (24). Thus, culturing conditions in vitro likely select for
survival of preexisting p53-mutant Her2/Neu tumor cells. As
noted approximately 72% of HER2þ breast cancers contain
mutations or deletions in TP53 (2), and therefore these
"immortalized" mouse spheres and adherent cultures resemble
human HER2þ breast cancer. Flow cytometry analysis revealed
that the CD24þ:CD49fþ fraction, which contains TICs (9, 19),
was sustained in sphere cultures, being approximately 77%,
68%, and 46% after ﬁrst, third, and seventh passages, respectively (Fig. 1D). In contrast, the TIC fraction rapidly diminished
under adherent conditions, being approximately 80%, 3.6%,
and 2.7% after ﬁrst, third, and seventh passages. To determine
TIC frequency, we transplanted 1,000, 250, or 50 cells from
"immortalized" cultures into mammary glands of isogenic FvB
recipient mice (n ¼ 12 for each). TIC frequency was 1/213
(range, 1/122—1/372; P < 0.0001 by ANOVA) and 1/3,375
(range, 1/1,280–1/8,899) in spheres and monolayer cells,
respectively (Fig. 1E). Together these results indicate that
sphere conditions maintain TICs, whereas monolayer cells
lose these tumorigenic cells after serial passages. All experiments described below were performed with these "immortalized" p53-mutant Her2þ spheres and monolayer cells from
passage three to eight, isolated from 12 to 15 independent
MMTV-Her2/Neu mammary tumors.
An shRNA kinome screen identiﬁes kinases required for
p53-mutant Her2þ sphere and adherent growth
We used a scheme presented in Fig. 2A to screen 520
kinases with approximately ﬁve shRNA per kinase (2,567
independent shRNAs) from the TRC1 library (Fig. 2B; ref. 21).
To minimize off-target effects, we followed hits in which at
least two of the approximately ﬁve shRNAs per gene suppressed growth below a threshold, which we set at 3-fold
inhibition (Fig. 2B). shRNAs for ﬁve genes (0.95%) preferentially suppressed sphere growth, 29 genes (5.5%) suppressed
both spheres and monolayer, and nine genes (1.7%) only
suppressed monolayer growth (Fig. 2C and Supplementary
Fig. S1; Supplementary Tables S1–S3). The latter genes were
not analyzed further. To validate our initial screen, we
generated independent lenti-shRNAs for all hits that targeted spheres only or spheres plus monolayer, and retested
their effects on adherent versus nonadherent growth. This
secondary screen agreed in general with the initial screen
(Supplementary Fig. S2A and S2B). In addition, we determined the effect of these shRNAs on growth of the immortalized mouse mammary epithelial cell line HC11. shRNAs

growth by more than 25% were excluded from further
analysis (Supplementary Fig. S2C).
The remaining hits targeted the mitogen-activated protein
kinase (MAPK) pathway (A-Raf, Raf1, Map3k14, Mapk15, and
mapkapk3) and TGFbR superfamily (Bmpr1b, Tgfbr1, TgfbR2,
Acvr2a, and Acvr2b), which were previously linked to HER2
signaling/cancer. Although inhibitors of the RAS/MAPK pathway such as MEK are promising, TGFb family receptors have
negative and positive effects on mammary tumor initiation and
metastasis, respectively (25), suggesting that they may not
represent good therapeutic targets. We also identiﬁed calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases Camk2d and
Cask, oxidant stress-activated serine/threonine kinase Stk25,
proautophagy related factor/unc-51–like kinase (ATG1/ULK1;
ref. 26), and the noncanonical IkB kinase (IKK), TBK1 (27),
which have not been previously linked to HER2þ breast cancer.
HER2þ breast cancer cells are highly sensitive to
autophagy inhibitors and to shRNA-mediated
knockdown of Atg1 or Tbk1
Cells transformed by activated RAS are highly sensitive to
autophagy and TBK1 inhibition (28, 29). However, the importance of Atg1 and TBK1 in HER2þ breast cancer in which RAS is
activated at a signiﬁcantly lower level is largely unknown. To
investigate the role of these factors in HER2þ breast cancer, we
ﬁrst analyzed their expression in primary and secondary
(transplanted) mammary Her2/Neu tumors (19). Both Atg1/
Ulk1 and Tbk1 were readily detected by RNA microarray
(Supplementary Fig. S3) and immunoblotting (Fig. 2D). We
next tested for efﬁcient shRNA knockdown of Atg1/Ulk1 and
Tbk1 as well as several other kinases identiﬁed in our screen:
Acvr2a, Tgfbr1, Camk2d, Cask, and Stk25. Expression of each
protein, with the exception of Camk2d, which we were unable
to detect at RNA or protein levels, was efﬁciently knocked
down by the corresponding shRNA (Fig. 2D).
ATG1/ULK1 plays a critical role in autophagosome assembly; it recruits other ATG proteins and induces autophagosome
formation by phosphorylating Beclin-1 and activating VPS34
lipid kinase (26). To determine the effect of inhibiting autophagy on HER2þ breast cancer cells, we used chloroquine, an
inhibitor of autophagosome–lysosome fusion (30, 31). Treatment of Neu monolayer cells with this drug led to accumulation of fast migrating, lipidated LC3 (LC3-II), a component of
the autophagosome (Supplementary Fig. S4A; ref. 26), indicating robust autophagy ﬂux. Chloroquine readily inhibited
growth of these cells (Supplementary Fig. S4B). 3-MA, an
inhibitor of VPS34, also potently inhibited HER2þ tumor
growth. Importantly, both chloroquine and 3-MA also inhibited growth of human HER2þ breast cancer cell lines HCC1954
and SKBR3 (Supplementary Fig. S4B). These autophagy inhibitors induced apoptosis in mouse Her2/Neu monolayer as
well as human HCC1954 and SKBR3 cells as revealed by ﬂow
cytometry with Annexin V, which accumulates on the surface
of apoptotic cells (Supplementary Fig. S4C and S4D). Thus,
HER2þ breast cancer cells are highly sensitive to Atg1 and
autophagy inhibitors.
TBK1 was the only kinase that had a stronger effect on
tumorsphere than monolayer growth. TBK1 and the related

kinase IKKe play important roles as regulators of innate
immunity by modulating interferon and NF-kB signaling
(27). In addition, TBK1 was identiﬁed in a synthetic lethal
screen for genes that could kill non–small cell lung cancer cell
lines driven by activated K-RAS (29), whereas IKKe was found
to be ampliﬁed in 30% of breast cancer and is able to transform
breast epithelial cells through activation of NF-kB (32–34).
Using a doxycycline-inducible shRNA expression system, we
independently conﬁrmed that knockdown of mouse Tbk1
hindered the growth of mouse Her2/Neu spheres better than
monolayer cells (Fig. 2E and F). Importance of this kinase in
human HER2þ breast cancer cells was conﬁrmed using two
shRNAs (TRCN3182 and TCRN3185), which suppressed
expression 2.3- to 3.2-fold in HCC1954 and SKBR3 HER2þ
breast cancer cells, and inhibited adherent growth by 65% to
70% (Fig. 2E and G and Supplementary Fig. S5).

TBK1/IKK« inhibitor, TBK1-II, cooperates with
lapatinib to suppress HER2þ tumor cell growth in vitro
and in vivo
Next, we determined the effect of drug inhibitors for TBK1
and several other kinases identiﬁed in our screen. For TBK1,
we used BX795, a TBK1/IKKe inhibitor, which also binds
several other kinases (35). We also synthesized TBK1-II, a
high-afﬁnity/high-speciﬁcity TBK1 and IKKe inhibitor (36). At
10 mmol/L, Cask and TGFbR1 antagonists effectively but not
completely abrogated sphere growth, whereas TBK1/IKKe
inhibitors BX795 and TBK1-II completely suppressed sphere
formation (Fig. 3A, bottom). This is contrasted with the more
even effect of these drugs on monolayer growth (Fig. 3A, top),
once again demonstrating the sensitivity of Her2þ tumorspheres to TBK1 inhibition. Dose–response analysis revealed
that TBK1-II was most potent with IC50 of 0.74 mmol/L for

Atg1, Cask, and Tgfbr1, and used lenti-GFP as negative
control. Six days after infection and puromycin selection,
100 live cells of each group were injected into mammary
glands of recipient FvB mice (n ¼ 6 each). Under these
conditions, 3 of 6 mice injected with control GFP mice and 2
of 6 mice injected with Tgfbr1-shRNA–infected cells developed tumors within 3 months. In contrast, no tumor (0/6)
was detected in mice injected with Tbk1-, Ulk1- or CaskshRNA–infected Her2/Neu tumor cells (P ¼ 0.0455 by the c2
test; Fig. 3E).
To determine the combined effect of TBK1-II and lapatinib
in vivo, we performed pharmacokinetic analysis of TBK1-II
after intraperitoneal or subcutaneous injection of immunocompromised NOD/SCID mice. This analysis revealed that the
half-life of TBK1-II was approximately 2 hours with plasma
concentration of approximately1 mmol/L up to 3 hours after 30
mg/kg i.p. dose (Supplementary Fig. S7). To test for cooperation between TBK1-II and lapatinib, we used suboptimal
concentrations of each drug. As the optimal dose of lapatinib
is 100 mg/kg given twice daily by gavage (39), we used 50 mg/kg
once a day. We also used a single, daily dose of 50 mg/kg TBK1II (i.p.). Two million HCC1954 HER2þ tumor cells were injected
into mammary glands of NOD/SCID mice. After 21 days, mice
with palpable tumors were randomized and treated daily with
vehicle (H2O), 50 mg/kg TBK1-II, 50 mg/kg lapatinib, or both
drugs (Fig. 3F, top). After additional 21 days, tumors were
dissected and weighed. Under these conditions, single treatments with TBK1-II or lapatinib alone failed to signiﬁcantly

suppress tumor growth. In contrast, combined TBK1-II plus
lapatinib therapy blocked tumor expansion more than 2-fold
(P ¼ 0.023; Fig. 3F, bottom). Thus, TBK-II and lapatinib can
cooperate to suppress HER2þ breast cancer growth both in
vitro and in vivo.
TBK1-II induces cell-cycle arrest, not apoptosis
To determine the mechanisms by which TBK1 affects
HER2þ breast cancer growth, we ﬁrst tested the effect of
TBK-II on signaling pathways. RNA extracted from TBK1-II–
treated HCC1954 cells was subject to transcriptional proﬁling
and global gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA; ref. 40), followed by "functional enrichment maps" to visualize the results
(19, 41). Lists of genes/pathways that were highly up- or
downregulated are shown in Supplementary Table S4A and
S4B. In accordance with the biology of TBK1 and IKKe, pathways involved in "viral reproduction," "response to viral infection," and "response to interferon" were downregulated in
TBK1-II–treated cells (Fig. 4). Also downregulated were pathways involved in "TCA cycle" and "oxidoreductase/glutathione"
as well as "RNA metabolism" and "cell cycle/mitosis." The
major upregulated pathways included "Toll" and "condensed
chromosome."
Interestingly, cell death or apoptotic pathways were not
upregulated in response to TBK1-II. Consistent with this,
Annexin V–7AAD staining failed to detect apoptosis following lenti-shRNATbk1 transduction or TBK1-II treatment (1–2
mmol/L; Fig. 5A). Some apoptosis was detected at 4 mmol/L

TBK1/IKKe as Targets for HER2þ Breast Cancer

(Fig. 5A, bottom). In contrast, lapatinib treatment readily
induced apoptotic cell death at 1 to 2 mmol/L.
As the pathway analysis revealed inhibition of the "cellcycle/mitosis" pathway, we next determined the effect of
TBK1-II on the cell cycle by ﬂow cytometric analysis of
propidium iodide–stained cells. Lenti-shRNATbk1 transduction
inhibited cell growth as evident from increased percentage
of cells in G0–G1 (M1 gate) with a corresponding reduction in
S–G2–M (M2 gate; Fig. 5B). Lapatinib (2 mmol/L) had only a
mild effect on cell-cycle distribution. Strikingly, TBK1-II treatment (2 mmol/L) virtually eliminated accumulation of cells in
all phases and dramatically increased the percentage of cells
with >4N chromosomes (M3 gate). This effect was also
observed by forward- and side-scattering ﬂow cytometry analysis (Fig. 5C). Thus, whereas lapatinib had no effect on tumor
cell size, TBK1-II treatment increased the percentage of large
cells, up to 8% to 12% of the culture, in a dose-dependent
manner (Fig. 5C, left). This effect was observed in mouse Her2/
Neu tumor cells as well as both human HER2þ breast cancer
lines (Fig. 5C, right).
TBK1-II induces cell senescence through inhibition of
p65–NF-kB phosphorylation and activation of p16ink4a,
and accelerates apoptosis together with lapatinib
Our observation that TBK1-II treatment increased cell size,
prompted us to determine whether it induced cellular senescence. Remarkably, large b-galactosidase–positive cells were
observed in approximately 20% of lenti-shRNATbk1 transduced,
and TBK1-II–treated cultures (Fig. 6A). TBK1 was reported to
control survival of several cell types by regulating Bcl-xL
expression and AKT phosphorylation (29, 36, 42). However, in
accordance with our observation that TBK1 inhibition did not
compromise cell survival, we found only minor effects of
genetic or pharmacologic inhibition of TBK1 or TBK1/IKKe
on BCL-xL and phospho-Ser473-AKT levels (Fig. 6B). The
NF-kB family proteins, RelA (p65), c-Rel, RelB, p50, and p52,
bind to DNA as dimers, the most common being a p65-p50
heterodimer (43). p65–NF-kB activity is induced by phosphorylation of serine536 (44). In untreated HER2þ breast cancer
cells, p65–NF-kB was highly phosphorylated on serine536 (Fig.
6C). Importantly, TBK1-II treatment of mouse and human
HER2þ breast cancer cells dramatically suppressed serine536
phosphorylation, hence, activity of p65–NF-kB. In addition,
expression of the prosenescence cyclin-dependent kinase
(CDK) inhibitor p16INK4A (45) was dramatically induced in
both mouse and human HER2þ breast cancer cells (Fig. 6C).
These results suggest that TBK1/IKKe prevents cell senescence
by activating NF-kB, and conversely, inhibition of these noncanonical IKK factors in HER2þ breast cancer cells suppresses
NF-kB activity and induces p16INK4A expression, resulting in
cellular senescence.
Finally, we investigated the combined effect of TBK1-II,
which induces senescence, and lapatinib, which induces
apoptosis, on these parameters. Lapatinib did not increase
the level of cellular senescence in combination with TBK1-II
(Fig. 6D, bottom). In contrast, cotreatment with TBK1-II
increased the level of apoptotic cells relative to lapatinib alone
(Fig. 6D, top). Thus, although TBK1-II inhibition promotes cell

www.aacrjournals.org

senescence, not apoptosis, it cooperates with lapatinib to
accelerate apoptotic cell death in HER2þ breast cancer.

Discussion
We report on the identiﬁcation of TBK1 and ATG1/ULK1 as
novel therapeutic targets for HER2þ breast cancer. Consistent
with the requirement for ATG1/ULK1, we showed that treatment with the autophagosome–lysosome fusion inhibitor
chloroquine efﬁciently suppressed growth of mouse and
human HER2þ breast cancer cells. Inhibition of autophagy
has been shown to augment the efﬁcacy of conventional
chemotherapy in divergent tumor types, including sensitivity
of HER2þ breast cancer to lapatinib and trastuzumab (46).
Indeed, chloroquine is being evaluated in several clinical trials
for the prevention of invasive breast cancer (e.g., 0811–0147).
Given the central role of ATG1 in initiating autophagic vesicle
formation (while chloroquine acts downstream), ATG1/ULK1
inhibitors may prove effective against HER2þ breast cancer in
combination with conventional or anti-HER2 therapy.
TBK1 was the only validated target that was preferentially
required for growth of mouse Her2/Neu tumorsphere versus
monolayer cells. Its differential effect on sphere versus adherent cultures may explain why it has not been identiﬁed in other
high-content screens of monolayer HER2þ cancer cells (e.g.,
ref. 47). Our shRNA library contained ﬁve shRNAs against IKKe,
which invariably scored below the cutoff, suggesting that this
gene is not essential for growth of mouse Her2/Neu tumor cells.
In contrast, shRNA-mediated knockdown of TBK1 alone efﬁciently inhibited growth of both mouse and human HER2þ
breast cancer cells. Thus, TBK1 is required to maintain growth
of these cells, and IKKe does not seem to compensate for TBK1
when the latter is knocked down. However, IKKe is ampliﬁed in
a third of human breast cancer. Coampliﬁcation of IKKe and
HER2 is seen in approximately 17% of HER2þ breast cancer
(cBioPortal for Cancer Genomics database). Thus, the contribution of IKKe to HER2þ breast cancer growth, hence,
response to TBK1/IKKe inhibitors, likely varies depending on
its ampliﬁcation/expression levels in different tumors.
Contrary to recent reports on RAS-transformed lung cancer
and other tumor types (29, 36, 42), we found that in HER2þ
breast cancer cells, inhibition of TBK1 did not dramatically
induce apoptosis or suppress BCL-xL levels or AKT phosphorylation. Instead, TBK1 or TBK1/IKKe inhibition led to cellular
senescence that was accompanied by suppression of p65–NFkB phosphorylation/activity and induction of p16INK4A. Interestingly, in different contexts, NF-kB was shown to induce or
suppress cellular senescence (44, 48). Our results suggest that
in HER2þ breast cancer, NF-kB actively prevents senescence
downstream of TBK1/IKKe. Zhang and colleagues have recently reported that the canonical NF-kB activator, IKKa, regulates
subcellular localization, hence activity of the CDK inhibitor
p27KIP1 (49). Whether TBK1 also regulates p27KIP1, and whether IKKa, like TBK1, affects p16INK4A expression remain to be
seen. In addition, whether TBK1 inhibition suppresses autophagy-mediated cell death in HER2þ breast cancer cells, as was
observed in other contexts (50), is yet to be determined. Finally,
we showed that TBK1-II inhibited growth of a trastuzumab-

cohorts of HER2þ breast cancer lines as well as other cancer
types driven by activation of HER2 signaling awaits further
investigation.
Importantly, although TBK1-II treatment did not induce
apoptosis, it cooperated with lapatinib to accelerate apoptosis,
compared with lapatinib alone. Consistent with this, TBK1-II
and lapatinib synergized to kill HER2þ breast cancer cells
in vivo under conditions of low doses in which each drug
alone had no signiﬁcant effect. Our results should, therefore,
encourage the assessment of TBK1/IKKe inhibitors in combination with anti-HER2 therapy as a potential new treatment
for HER2þ breast cancer.
