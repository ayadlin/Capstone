Abstract

Author Manuscript

Cancer stem cells (CSCs), a small and elusive population of undifferentiated cancer cells within
tumors that drive tumor growth and recurrence, are believed to resemble normal stem cells.
Although surrogate markers have been identified and compelling CSC theoretical models abound,
actual proof for the existence of CSCs can only be had retrospectively. Hence, great store has
come to be placed in isolating CSCs from cancers for in-depth analysis. On the other hand,
although induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) hold great promise for regenerative medicine,
concern exists over the inadvertent co-transplantation of partially or undifferentiated stem cells
with tumorigenic capacity. Here we demonstrate that the introduction of defined reprogramming
factors (OCT4, SOX2, Klf4 and c-Myc) into MCF-10A nontumorigenic mammary epithelial cells,
followed by partial differentiation, transforms the bulk of cells into tumorigenic CD44+/CD24low
cells with CSC properties, termed here as induced CSC-like-10A or iCSCL-10A cells. These
reprogrammed cells display a malignant phenotype in culture and form tumors of multiple

lineages when injected into immunocompromised mice. Compared with other transformed cell
lines, cultured iCSCL-10A cells exhibit increased resistance to the chemotherapeutic compounds,
Taxol and Actinomycin D, but higher susceptibility to the CSC-selective agent Salinomycin and
the Pin1 inhibitor Juglone. Restored expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor
p16INK4a abrogated the CSC properties of iCSCL-10A cells, by inducing cellular senescence.
This study provides some insight into the potential oncogenicity that may arise via cellular
reprogramming, and could represent a valuable in vitro model for studying the phenotypic traits of
CSCs per se.

INTRODUCTION

Author Manuscript

Recent advances in stem cell and cancer biology have provided strong, although indirect or
retrospective, evidence for the existence of cancer stem cells (CSCs) in a variety of both
solid and hematopoietic tumors.1–3 In solid tumors, a small subset of CSCs appear to reside
within the tumor mass and this population constitutes a reservoir of cancer-initiating cells
with the exclusive ability to self-renew and maintain this mass.4 This cell population has
come to be implicated as the source of disease recurrence and metastasis during the long
period of cancer development.1–3 Most CSCs exhibit resistance to conventional anticancer
therapies including chemotherapeutic agents and ionizing radiation.5 The development of
novel drugs that target CSC-specific factors should aim to effectively eliminate the CSC
population within the tumor, resulting in complete cure of the disease.6 To date, however,
evaluation of drugs that specifically target CSCs has been hampered because of the
difficulty in isolating CSCs from the bulk of tumor tissues, and the manipulation of pure
populations ex vivo.7,8

In common with normal stem cells, CSCs are defined by their double capacity for selfrenewal and tissue regeneration through differentiation, and can give rise to phenotypically
diverse cells.4 It is quite plausible that CSCs may use the molecular machinery and factors
that control normal stem cell function to maintain their oncogenic existence.9–11 It almost
goes without saying that deeper comprehension of the characteristics of CSCs and their
parallels with normal stem cells will in turn further our understanding of cancer
pathogenesis.7,12 To date, the characterization of CSC properties has been limited, and the
putative factors directing both normal and transformed stem cell processes have not been
elucidated, largely because of the difficulty in obtaining CSCs in vitro.
Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are generated from nonpluripotent cells, typically
adult somatic cells, through the ectopic expression of the transcription factors OCT4 and
SOX2 combined with either Klf4 and c-Myc, or Lin28 and Nanog.13,14 The iPSCs acquire
the features of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) including immortal cell growth and
pluripotency, thus enabling their self-renewal and differentiation into multiple lineages.13,14

medical applications, the molecular events occurring during and after the reprogramming
process in these cells have not been clarified. Furthermore, the delineation of molecular
signatures to detect malignant transformation among human iPSCs represents an important
new challenge in both stem cell and cancer biology. In this regard, several recent studies
describe attempts to create CSC-like cells via the ectopic expression of reprogramming
factors in already transformed cell lines including gastrointestinal cancer, chronic myeloid
leukemia and melanoma.15–17 In these studies, however, it is believed that CSC-like
properties pre-existed in the original tumorigenic cell line, and could be selected for during
the reprogramming step.

In the current study, we used iPSC technology to reprogram nontumorigenic human
MCF-10A mammary epithelial cells. The resultant cells possess the hallmarks of CSCs and
generate tumors in an immunosuppressed mouse model comprising cells of multiple
lineages. These results help shed light on the possibility for tumorigenicity of epithelial cells
by defined reprogramming factors, and provide a potentially valuable system for the study
of CSCs in vitro.

RESULTS
Reprogramming of human immortalized mammary epithelial MCF-10A cells by defined
reprogramming factors

Author Manuscript

MCF-10A is a mammary epithelial cell line, immortalized by a disruption of the p16 tumorsuppressor gene due to a spontaneous chromosomal translocation.18,19 Like normal human
breast epithelial cells, MCF-10A cells have no tumor initiation ability, but have been shown
to be more susceptible to oncogenic transformation than primary cells.20 The retroviralmediated introduction of OCT4, SOX2, Klf-4 and c-Myc into MCF-10A cells, followed by
growth in human ESC (hESC) culture medium supplemented with basic fibroblast growth
factor on mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) feeder cells, gave rise to iPS-like (iPSL)
colonies after 14 days (Figures 1a and b). The sole introduction of the c-Myc oncogene did
not generate iPS-like colonies (data not shown). The colonies that formed demonstrated
well-defined phase-bright borders surrounded by feeder cells and comprising small cells
with high nuclear/cytoplasmic ratios and prominent nucleoli, indistinguishable from
standard iPSCs (Figure 1b).

Author Manuscript

These iPSL colonies were continually cultured up to 21 days and 11 alkaline phosphatasepositive representative colonies were picked up. Of these, four clones (designated
iPSL-10A1–4) were chosen at random and further analyzed. Immunocytochemical analysis
revealed the expression of pluripotent stem cell markers including OCT4, SOX2, Nanog and
TRA-1-60 (Figure 1b). Stem cell marker expression was also confirmed in these clones by
reverse transcriptase–PCR and immunoblotting (Figures 1c and d). Conversely, expression
of the differentiated epithelial cell marker cytokeratin 7 (CK7) was silenced during the
reprogramming process (Figure 1d). Additionally, expression of Pin1 was activated in
iPSL-10A cells (Figure 1d), as is the case for normal iPS cells21 (Figure 1d). iPSL-10A
colonies could be expanded in an undifferentiated state beyond 20 passages (data not
shown). Analysis with an Illumina Human Methylation 27 Bead Chip (MBL, Nagoya,

Japan) revealed that the DNA methylation patterns of iPSL-10A cells were closer to those of
normal iPSCs than to the parental MCF-10A cells (Figure 1e).
We next examined whether the reprogramming in these cells might be associated with the
insertion of the transgenes in specific regions of the genome by using linear amplificationmediated PCR and sequencing analysis of proviral integration sites among the iPSL-10A
cell clones. The linear amplification-mediated PCR results revealed that the transgenes that
were detectable were inserted at different, random chromosomal loci among the four clones
(Figure 1f). Moreover, comprehensive karyotyping revealed that iPSL-10A cells were
indistinguishable from the parental MCF-10A cells (Figure 1g).
In vitro differentiation of iPSL-10A cells into CSC-like cells

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

We next attempted to differentiate the iPSL-10A cells in vitro, based on the rationale that a
differentiation step would be incorporated into any type of regenerative medicine application
involving cell transplantation using iPSCs. A standard and general method for ESC
differentiation in vitro is via the formation of cell aggregates in nonadherent spheroids
known as embryoid bodies (EBs).22 As for normal iPSCs, the iPSL-10A cells formed EBlike spherical aggregates in suspension culture containing differentiation-promoting medium
(Figures 2a and b). iPSL-10A-derived EB-like colonies were subsequently transferred into
culture dish-attachment conditions and allowed to continue to differentiate for a further 7
days (Figures 2a and b). The attached cells were then exposed to maintenance cell culture
medium for a further 15 days, and the surviving cells designated as iCSCL-10A. As a
control, we performed the same procedure for standard iPSCs derived from normal human
mammary epithelial cells, the products of which were designated as iPSC-EBD (iPS cells
having undergone EB-mediated differentiation). Immunofluorescence analysis revealed that
>90% of iCSCL-10A cells express the CSC markers CD44 and ABCG2 as well as the stem
cell marker SOX2, but negligible levels of differentiated epithelial markers CK7, CK8 and
smooth muscle actin (Figure 2c). In contrast, iPSC-EBD cells did not express any of the
three CSC markers, but expressed all three differentiation markers (Figure 2c). Importantly,
the majority of parental iPSL-10A cells expressed CD44 and ABCG2 at very low levels.
However, a very small population of these cells exhibited levels of expression of both
proteins that were comparable to iCSCL-10A cells (Supplementary Figure S1).

Author Manuscript

Most interestingly, iCSCL-10A cells were found to have acquired malignant properties in
focus formation (Figures 3a and b), colony formation (Figures 3c and d) and cell invasion
assays (Figures 3e and f), whereas the iPSC-EBD cells showed no malignant phenotype in
any of these assays (Figures 3a–f). These results indicate that the iCSCL-10A cells had
undergone malignant transformation following nuclear reprogramming.
Characterization of the CSC properties of the iCSCL-10A clones
Subsequent to 30 days of differentiation/maintenance of iPSL-10A cells, flow cytometric
analysis revealed that each of the resulting iCSCL-10A1–4 cells harbored a population
(>90%) with a CD44+/ CD24low marker profile (Figure 4a) that has previously been
associated with CSCs.2,3 The iCSCL-10A cells had ability to form tumor spheres as an in
vitro assay of the self-renewal capacity of CSCs. Indeed, iCSCL-10A cells showed an ~10-

fold higher tumor sphere-forming ability relative to MCF7 or MCF-10A-Ras cells,
transformed by the introduction of the HrasV12 oncogene into MCF-10A cells23 (Figures 4b
and c).

Author Manuscript

Reverse transcriptase–PCR analysis revealed that iCSCL-10A cells, but not MCF7 and
MCF-10A-Ras cells, expressed aldehyde dehydrogenase 1A1 (ALDH1A1) as a CSC
marker24 (Figure 4d). The iCSCL-10A cells also expressed the epithelial-to-mesenchymal
transition-related genes Snail and Slug (Figure 4d). Immunofluorescent analysis revealed the
nuclear localization (a hallmark of activation) of Gli1 (hedgehog signaling) and Notch1
(Notch signaling), but not β-Catenin (Wnt signaling) in iCSCL-10A cells (Supplementary
Figure S2a). Furthermore, the transforming growth factor-β signaling proteins Smad1,
Smad3 and Smad5 were preferentially activated in these cells as revealed by
immunoblotting analysis with phospho-Smad-specific antibodies (Supplementary Figure
S2b).
As Slug has been shown to induce the CSC phenotype in MCF-10A cells,25 we performed a
knockdown analysis of this gene in iCSCL-10A cells and found in a tumor sphere assay that
slugshRNA-transduced cells exhibited reduced growth and self-renewal ability compared
with control cells (Supplementary Figure S3a). Furthermore, both SOX2 and CD44
expression was decreased in these cells (Supplementary Figure S3b).

A major characteristic of CSCs is their resistance to anticancer agents. We next assayed the
resistance of iCSCL-10A cells to various chemotherapeutic drugs. The iCSCL-10A cells
exhibited increased resistance to the established anticancer chemotherapeutic compounds,
Taxol and Actinomycin D, relative to both the control MCF7 breast cancer cells and
MCF-10A-Ras cells (Figure 4e). In contrast, iCSCL-10A cells were more sensitive to
Salinomycin, a drug that selectively targets CSCs6 and to the selective Pin1 inhibitor
Juglone compared with MCF7 or MCF-10ARas cells (Figure 4e). Subsequent TUNEL
(terminal deoxyribonucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling) assay
revealed that Juglone treatment selectively induces cellular apoptosis in iCSCL-10A cells as
compared with parental MCF-10A cells (Figures 4f and g).
It has been shown that Pin1 function is also regulated by the phosphorylation status of both
Pin1 and its target proteins.26 Indeed, an immunoblotting analysis revealed that although
Pin1 was more highly phosphorylated in iCSCL-10A cells than in iPSCs, potential Pin1binding sites, recognized by phospho-CDK substrate antibodies, were more prominently
phosphorylated in iCSCL-10A cells than in normal iPSCs (Supplementary Figure S4),
suggesting a profound role of Pin1 in iCSCL-10A cells.

iCSCL-10A cells form multilineage tumors in vivo
We next assessed the ability of iCSCL-10A cells to form tumors in an immunosuppressed
mouse model. We injected iCSCL-10A, MCF-10A-Ras, parental MCF-10A or iPSC-EBD
cells subcutaneously into BALB/c nude mice and monitored them for 9 to 12 weeks. Tumors
were generated using as few as 1 × 103 iCSCL-10A, which was 10-fold lower than the
number of MCF-10A-Ras cells required for tumor seeding (Figure 5a). There was no
evidence of tumor formation in the MCF-10A- or iPSC-EBD-injected mice up to 1 × 105

cells (Figure 5a). Histological examinations of tumor tissues revealed that iCSCL-10A cells
produced a florid proliferation of small round immature cells with focal mitotic figures
(Figure 5b, left). Notably, the tumor contained structures resembling differentiated cells of
the bone and muscle lineages (Figure 5b, middle and right). Epithelial (CK), mesenchymal
(vimentin), neuronal (β3-tubulin), endothelial (human CD34; does not crossreact with mouse
CD34),27 calcifying osteoblastic (osteopontin) and myoblastic (smooth muscle actin)positive cells were detected by immunohistochemical analysis (Figure 5c). We detected, by
immunofluorescence, prominent histological borders of cell populations between putatively
less differentiated (SOX2+/AE1/ 3 cytokeratin−) and more differentiated cells (SOX2−/
AE1/3 cytokeratin+) within the tumor (Figure 5d).
Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p16INK4a induces cell cycle arrest and senescence in
iCSCL-10A cells

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

The parental MCF-10A human mammary gland epithelial cells harbor a cytogenetic
abnormality involving a chromosome 9 translocation resulting in the deletion of the
CDKN2A (p16INK4a) gene. To determine the functional role of p16INK4a in the proliferation
and maintenance of CSC-like cells, iCSCL-10A cells were transduced with p16INK4a using a
retrovirus vector followed by selection with puromycin. Immunoblotting analysis confirmed
the stable expression of the exogenous p16 gene and decreased amounts of phosphorylated
Rb (Figure 6a). Cell cycle analysis demonstrated a significantly increased G1 population of
p16INK4atransduced cells compared with the control vector-transduced cells (Figure 6b).
Cells transduced with p16INK4a exhibited an enlarged, flattened and irregular shape, and
flow cytometric analysis revealed this effect in terms of forward scatter and side scatter
profiles (Figure 6c, upper panels). These cells also positively stained with senescenceassociated β-galactosidase, whereas no such cells were observed among the control vectortransduced population (Figure 6d). Concomitantly, the fraction of the CSC population that
was CD44+/CD24low was significantly reduced for the cells transduced with p16INK4a (from
86.3 to 21.0%, Figure 6c, lower panels). In line with these observations, the SOX2
localization profile was found to be significantly shifted from a nuclear to a cytoplasmic
distribution, as revealed by immunofluorescence (Figure 6e).

Author Manuscript

The transduction of p16INK4a into iCSCL-10A cells significantly reduced the rate of tumor
sphere formation down to ~20% (Figure 6f), indicating that the re-introduction of p16INK4a
can suppress the self-renewal properties of iCSCL-10A cells. An important feature of CSCs
is their increased mobility. To evaluate whether p16INK4a regulates cell migration in this
context, wound healing assays were performed. At 6 h following cell scratching, the extent
of wound closure for the empty vector control cells was 90%, whereas that for the p16INK4atransduced cells was significantly less, at 45% (Figure 6g).
An in vivo tumor-initiating assay revealed no evidence of tumor formation in the
iCSCL-10A/ p16INK4a -injected BALB/c nude mouse (1 × 105 cells), whereas control
vector-transduced iCSCL-10A cells still formed tumors, indicating that iCSCL-10A cells
had lost their tumor-initiating properties following the re-expression of p16INK4a
(Supplementary Figure S5). Taken together, these results together indicate that the reintroduction of p16INK4a can indeed attenuate the CSC properties of iCSCL-10A cells.

DISCUSSION
We have demonstrated in the current study that the introduction of defined reprogramming
factors and subsequent partial cell differentiation generate cells with a tumorigenic
phenotype and CSC-like properties from nontransformed human MCF-10A mammary
epithelial cells. These cells show a resistance profile against anticancer agents that is
normally associated with CSCs. Moreover, these transformed cells can be maintained in
culture in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal
bovine serum (FBS), permitting easy manipulation and amenability to large-scale drug
screening and could therefore provide a valuable basis for the further analysis of CSC
characteristics and drug development strategies designed to target CSCs.

Several studies have suggested that the molecular circuitry controlling pluripotency in stem
cells is also important for the tumor-initiating ability of cancer cells. In fact, the pluripotent
cell markers OCT4, SOX2, Klf4 and Nanog have been shown to be expressed in certain
cancer cell types and to play important roles in oncogenesis.28–31 A recent study has
reported a crucial role for SOX2 but not OCT4 and Nanog in breast CSCs. SOX2 expression
was found in this report to be induced upon the formation of tumor spheres from natural
breast tumor cultures and breast carcinoma cell lines.32 SOX2 has been shown to be
expressed in a variety of early stage of breast carcinomas and metastatic lymph nodes.33
Hence, high SOX2 expression in iCSCL-10A cells may contribute to the high tumorinitiating ability of these cells.

The current picture of carcinogenesis from iPSCs is ambiguous. Pre-iPS cells have been
defined as incompletely reprogrammed multipotent stem cells that arise during the induction
of iPSCs.13,34 Like iPSCs, pre-iPS cells have been shown to form tumors in
immunosuppressed mouse models, but their histology is not considered to be that of a
teratoma13 but rather a phenotype that is reminiscent of the induced CSCs described herein.
Furthermore, iPS reprogramming of p53 knockout or p53 mutant mouse embryonic
fibroblasts led to the development of cells with a potential to form malignant tumors with
sarcoma-like morphology in nude mice.35 Moreover, mouse iPSCs cultured in mouse Lewis
lung carcinoma conditioned medium acquire the characteristics of CSCs.36 These data
suggest that iPS reprogramming factors might be adequate to transform somatic cells with
certain genetic defects or specific culture conditions. However, the iPS-mediated malignant
cells analyzed to date come from a rodent source, cells that are believed to be more
susceptible to transformation than human cells.37 Meanwhile, the current system using
nontumorigenic human mammary epithelial MCF-10A cells may cast new light on the
susceptibility of nontumorigenic human mammary epithelial cells to neoplastic
reprogramming. How similar the CSC-like cells described in the current paper are to human
pre-iPS remains unknown. However, such a comparison may be an important point of
departure for future studies concerned with both CSCs and the oncogenic potential of cells
produced using iPS technology.
MCF-10A is an immortalized but nontransformed human breast epithelial cell line that is
widely used in molecular studies of cancer.19 In addition, although these cells have only a
small number of chromosome translocations, one of which results in the depletion of the

p16INK4a gene,18 they show a normal mammary epithelial cell morphology and phenotype
and can successfully form mammary acini in 3D matrigel cultures.20 These characteristics of
MCF-10A cells prompted us to use them for our current model system. As many previous
studies have already reported, the INK4A gene locus is completely silenced and p16INK4a is
not usually expressed in pluripotent stem cells such as ESCs and iPSCs.38,39 Indeed, several
different groups have demonstrated that the INK4A gene locus critically impairs successful
reprogramming to pluripotent stem cells and that it represents a principal barrier to iPS cell
reprogramming through the induction of reprogramming-induced senescence.40–42 In human
somatic cells, the inhibition of p16INK4a enhances the iPSC generation, increasing both the
kinetics of reprogramming and the number of emerging iPSC colonies.39 Furthermore, our
current study demonstrates that the re-expression of p16INK4a can indeed attenuate the CSC
properties and in vivo tumorigenicity of iCSCL-10A cells. Thus, the loss of p16INK4a may
affect not only the oncogenic reprogramming but also the maintenance of malignant
properties of iCSC-10A cells.

In general, CSCs have increased resistance to conventional anticancer chemotherapeutic
agents.5 We observed that iCSCL-10A cells exhibited higher sensitivity to the Pin1-selective
inhibitor Juglone compared with MCF7 or MCF-10A-Ras cells, which may reflect the
importance of Pin1 in the maintenance of pluripotency of CSC through the binding and
stabilization of key ‘stemness’ factors such as Nanog and OCT4 as is the case for human
iPSCs and murine ESCs.21,43 This drug-sensitivity profile, together with our finding that
Pin1 expression is induced during the nuclear reprogramming process, tempts us to propose
that iCSCL-10A cells are distinct from the parental MCF-10A cells as well as from various
transformed cancer cell lines with respect to the dependency on Pin1. Considered along with
our current results, this leads us to speculate that Pin1 could be an essential factor for the
self-renewal and proliferation of CSC, and even perhaps a potential molecular target for
CSC-based therapy.
In summary, we here describe the oncogenic transformation of mammary epithelial cells and
consequent generation of a potentially valuable model system for the study of CSCs and
development of alternative anticancer strategies that target CSCs.

MCF-10A cells were transduced with retroviral vectors encoding nuclear reprogramming
factors as described previously.44 Briefly, the retroviral vector plasmids pMXs-hOCT4,
pMXs-hSOX2, pMXs-hKlf4, pMXs-hc-Myc (Addgene, Cambridge, MA, USA) and VSV-G
were introduced into Plat-E cells using Effectene transfection reagent (QIAGEN, Maryland,
MD, USA). After 48 h, virus-containing supernatants were passed through a 0.45 µm filter
and supplemented with 10 µg/ml polybrene. MCF-10A cells were seeded at 6 × 105 cells per
100mm dish 24 h before incubation in the virus/polybrene-containing supernatants for 16 h.
Cells were then washed and returned to fresh MEGM medium. After 6 days, the cells were
plated on irradiated MEFs and the MEGM culture medium was replaced with hESC culture
medium 24 h later. Cells were maintained at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator for 21 days.

Alkaline phosphatase staining was performed using the Leukocyte Alkaline Phosphatase kit
(Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.

The iPSL-10A cells were dissociated using accutase and seeded on a Matrigel (BD
Biosciences, San Diego, CA, USA) coated dish in MEF-conditioned hESC medium for
feeder-free culture. The iPSL-10A cells were also dissociated using accutase and plated on
ultra low-attachment plates (Cell Seed) at a density of 1 × 104 cells per 6 wells in
differentiation medium (KNOCKOUT DMEM supplemented with 20% FBS, 1%
GlutaMAX; Invitrogen), 100 µM nonessential amino acids (Invitrogen), 1% penicillin/
streptomycin and 50 µM β-mercaptoethanol. After 7 days, the embryoid body-like colonies
were transferred to 0.1% gelatin-coated culture dishes and cultured for a further 8 days in
the same medium. Finally, medium was replaced by DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS
for 15 days before fixation and staining.

Cells were washed twice with antibiotic-free and serum-free cell culture medium and finally
resuspended in 0.1 ml of serum-free culture medium. The cell suspension was then mixed
with an equal volume of Matrigel (BD Biosciences) and injected subcutaneously into 6week-old irradiated (4 Gy) BALB/c nude mice (CLEA, Tokyo, Japan). Injections were
performed 1 day after irradiation. Tumors were surgically removed 9 to 12 weeks later.
Representative tumor tissues were fixed in 3% formalin, embedded in paraffin wax and
sectioned at a thickness of 10 µm. Sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin for
pathological examination, or processed for immunohistochemical analysis. All animal
protocols were approved by the institutional Administrative Panel on Laboratory Animal
Care of Yokohama City University.

Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol (Invitrogen). Complementary DNA synthesis was
performed with ReverTraAce-α (Toyobo, Osaka, Japan) in accordance with the
manufacturer’s instructions. PCR was performed with ExTaq (Takara Bio, Shiga, Japan)

For immuncytochemistry, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at 4 °C,
washed with phosphate-buffered saline and then permeabilized using 0.1% Triton X-100
and blocked with 5% goat serum in 0.1% bovine serum albumin. Primary antibodies were
diluted in 0.1% bovine serum albumin and incubated with the fixed cells for 1 h at room
temperature. For immunohistochemistry, paraffin-embedded tissue sections were subjected
to antigen retrieval with microwave irradiation in citrate buffer (pH 6.0). This was followed
by incubation with primary antibody at room temperature for 60 min. After incubation with
secondary antibody at room temperature for 60 min, the sections were stained with
VECTASTAIN Universal Elite ABC Kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The primary antibodies used in this study were
as follows: anti-OCT4 (1:300; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA), antiSOX2 (1:300; Millipore, Billerrica, MA, USA), anti-TRA-1-60 (1:200; eBioscience, San
Diego, CA, USA), anti-Nanog (1:300; ReproCELL, Yokohama, Japan), anti-Cytokeratin 7
(1:50, M7018; Dako Cytomation, Düsseldorf, Germany), anti-Cytokeratin 8 (1:50; Becton
Dickinson, Mountain view, CA, USA), anti-cytokeratin AE1/AE3 (1:500; Abcam,
Cambridge, MA, USA), anti-CD44 (1:100; Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA, USA), antiABCG2 (1:100; BioLegend, San Diego, CA, USA), anti-β-Tubulin III (1:100; Sigma), antihCD34 (1:100; Abcam), anti-Osteopontin (1:100; Sigma), anti-Vimentin (V9, 1:300;
Abcam) and anti-smooth muscle actin (1:100; Sigma).
Cell invasion assay

Author Manuscript

Cell invasion assay was performed in 24-well format Transwell inserts (8 µm pore, BD
Biosciences) coated with 1 mg/ml matrigel (BD Biosciences) as described previously.45
Invasive cells were counted and scored in triplicate (lower chamber).
Soft agar colony formation assay
Soft agar colony formation assays were performed by seeding 5 × 103 cells in 60-mm tissue
culture dishes containing 0.3% top low-melting point agarose/0.5% bottom low-melting

point agarose. Cells were fed every 4 days and colonies were counted and measured after 2
weeks.
Karyotyping
Karyotyping was performed by Nihon Gene Research Laboratories (Sendai, Japan), as
described previously.44 At least 15 metaphase spreads per genotype and from at least two
independent cultures per genotype were scored for chromosomal aberrations.
Tumor sphere formation assay
Single cells were seeded in ultra low-attachment dishes (Corning, New York, NY, USA) at a
density of 2 × 104 cells/ml and cultured for 7 days in serum-free DMEM/Ham’s F12 nutrient
mixture (1:1, v/v) supplemented with 5 mg/ml insulin, 0.5 mg/ml hydrocortisone, 2% B27
and 20 ng/ml epidermal growth factor.

Wound healing assay
Cell layers were gently wounded through the central axis of the plate using a pipette tip. The
migration of cells into the wound was observed at 6 h in six random selected microscopic
fields. Wound closures were quantified using an image processing and analysis software
program (ImageJ 1.40g, Bethesda, MD, USA).
