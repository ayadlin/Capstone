ABSTRACT
Background: A model to predict chemotherapy response would provide a marked
clinical benefit, enabling tailored treatment of oesophageal cancer, where less than
half of patients respond to the routinely administered chemotherapy.
Methods: Cancer cells were established from tumour biopsies taken from
individual patients about to undergo neoadjuvant chemotherapy. A 3D-tumour growth
assay (3D-TGA) was developed, in which cancer cells were grown with or without
supporting mesenchymal cells, then subjected to chemo-sensitivity testing using the
standard chemotherapy administered in clinic, and a novel emerging HDAC inhibitor,
Panobinostat.
Results: Individual patient’s cancer cells could be expanded and screened within a
clinically applicable timescale of 3 weeks. Incorporating mesenchymal support within
the 3D-TGA significantly enhanced both the growth and drug resistance profiles of the
patient’s cancer cells. The ex vivo drug response in the presence, but not absence,
of mesenchymal cells accurately reflected clinical chemo-sensitivity, as measured by
tumour regression grade. Combination with Panobinostat enhanced response and
proved efficacious in otherwise chemo-resistant tumours.
Conclusions: This novel method of establishing individual patient oesophageal
cancers in the laboratory, from small endoscopic biopsies, enables clinically-relevant
chemo-sensitivity testing, and reduces use of animals by providing more refined in
vitro models for pre-screening of drugs. The 3D-TGA accurately predicted chemosensitivity in patients, and could be developed to guide tailored patient treatment.
The incorporation of mesenchymal cells as the stromal cell component of the tumour
micro-environment had a significant effect upon enhancing chemotherapy drug
resistance in oesophageal cancer, and could prove a useful target for future drug
development.

INTRODUCTION

over half of patients do not benefit whilst suffering
toxic chemotherapy-related side-effects. [3] A model
to understand the mechanisms of chemo-resistance in
tumours and that can potentially predict which patients
are most likely to benefit from chemotherapy would
provide a marked clinical advantage and an opportunity
for personalised treatment of oesophageal cancer. [4]
We have previously described a pre-clinical tumour
model (3D tumour growth assay, 3D-TGA) that allows
chemotherapeutic drug testing in a more accurate and

There are over 8,000 new diagnoses of oesophageal
cancer per year in the UK and near 500,000 worldwide.
[1] Mortality remains high, with a 5-year overall survival
of only 13%. [1] In the UK and much of Europe, routine
treatment for potentially curable patients is neo-adjuvant
chemotherapy and resectional surgery followed by
adjuvant chemotherapy. [2] However, the response
rate to neo-adjuvant chemotherapy is only 40%, so

clinically-relevant setting, using ‘close-to-patient’ cells
isolated from patient-derived xenografts. [5] Incorporating
extracellular matrix and mesenchymal support restores
both direct and paracrine tumour-stroma interactions
which are known to influence drug resistance. [6, 7]
Here, we have modified the 3D-TGA to allow it to
be used for cells derived from small biopsies such as those
taken endoscopically prior to chemotherapy treatment
of oesophageal cancer. This would allow the evaluation
of the chemo-naïve tumour within a clinically-relevant
timescale of 3 weeks, whilst the patient is progressing
through the histological diagnosis, multicomponent
staging and cancer MDT pathway [8], before referral for
consideration of neo-adjuvant chemotherapy. The assay
is amenable to pharmacological testing in a 384-well
format allowing numerous drugs and combinations to be
tested simultaneously. The clinical validity was assessed
by comparing the chemo-sensitivity measured in the
3D-TGA with the actual clinical response, as measured by
the Mandard tumour regression grade (TRG). [9]

Close-to-patient oesophageal cancer cells can be
established in vitro using a feeder layer culture
system and grown in the 3D-TGA
79 chemotherapy-naïve tumour biopsy samples
were obtained from the 70 patients recruited. A cohort
of 30 patients and their tissue was used in the novel
method development phase of the study and did not
generate patient cancer cells. Using the feeder layer
method, individual patient in vitro cancer cell cultures
were established reliably in a subsequent group of 28/40
patients (70%); with the other 12 patient’s tumour cultures
excluded for technical reasons (see online Supplementary
Figure S1). There was no apparent difference in
oncological or demographic characteristics between those
that did / did not establish (see online Supplementary
Table S3).

Clinical
inclusion
criteria
(oesophageal
adenocarcinoma; completion of 3 full-dose cycles of
ECF neoadjuvant chemotherapy; definitive surgery
and TRG assigned) were necessary to ensure accurate
correlation between the clinical chemo-sensitivity in
patients as measured by TRG, and in vitro chemosensitivity as assessed by the 3D-TGA. Patient reasons
(e.g. advanced disease requiring palliation) and
oncological causes (e.g. non-completion of chemotherapy)
requiring study exclusion, resulted in a final group of 12
samples from nine patients who underwent the detailed
chemotherapeutic analysis in this study (see online
Supplementary Figure S1). Five of these nine patients
had a matched, chemotherapy-exposed resected tumour
established in vitro which also underwent chemosensitivity analysis. The baseline demographic, surgical
and oncological details for these nine patients with
samples established from chemotherapy-naïve biopsies
who met these inclusion criteria were recorded (Table 1),
have a similar distribution of grade and aggressiveness,
and are comparable to a standard clinical cohort presenting
with disease amenable to neoadjuvant chemotherapy and
surgery with curative intent. [10]
Mean age on presentation was 63 years, with a
male predominance 89% (n = 8) and similar cTNMs
of T3 N0-2 within the group, and stages IIB to IIIC.
The proportion (33%, n = 3) of chemotherapy sensitive
tumours (TRG 1-3), was broadly comparable to that seen
in clinical practice (40%). [10] There was no significant
difference between the mean time (26 and 21 days for the
TRG 1-3 and TRG 4-5 cancers respectively) to develop
each patient tumour into an established in vitro patient
cancer cell culture of sufficient volume for laboratory
experimentation ( > 1 x107 cells). When grown in the
3D-TGA each individual close-to-patient cell culture
grew in reproducible fashion (Figure 1A), with some
variation in growth rate between the different patient
lines, and developed into multicellular cancer cell clusters
(Figure 1B, 1C). The growth of the hMSCs was minimal
compared to the cancer cells (see online Supplementary
Figure S2), so did not affect overall growth measurement
by alamarBlue. In co-culture, the cancer cell clusters
displayed a small but significant increase in growth (p <
0.05) compared to those without mesenchymal support
(Figure 1D).

columnar-type epithelium (rather than adjacent normal
squamous oesophageal epithelium); and neoplastic
phenotype, as oesophageal p53 staining is not found in
non-dysplastic Barrett’s Oesophagus. [11, 12] Trefoil
Factor 3 (TFF3) is involved in protection, maintenance
and repair of the intestinal mucosa, [13] specific for
cells with an intestinal phenotype, [14] and is a reliable
marker of metaplastic change in the oesophagus. [15] It
was present in all of the primary patient cancer tissue, but
absent in the feeder layer culture of the close-to-patient
cancer cells, however expression was restored in both the
3D-TGA with mesenchymal support (Figure 1E, 1F) and
xenografts (Figure 2). The potential oesophageal cancer
stem cell (CSC) markers CD44 [16, 17] and ALDH [18,
19] were present in 11/17 (64.7%) and 13/17 (76.5%) of
the samples respectively, and both were present in 9/17
(52.9%) of the samples (Table 2). Expression in the
primary patient tumour was reflected in the corresponding
close-to-patient cells and xenografts (Figure 2), suggesting
maintenance of cells with a CSC-like phenotype in culture.
Although numbers are small, the presence of ALDH and
CD44 (either individually or together) did not relate to
stage of disease, pre- or post-chemotherapy tissue status,
the TRG, or in vitro growth.

The 3D-TGA using close-to-patient cells with
mesenchymal cell co-culture accurately models
clinical chemo-sensitivity
When the 3D-TGA was used to assess chemosensitivity, dose-dependent responses were observed
(Figure 3A) with IC50s that varied between different
patients, and sensitivity to chemotherapy agents was
reduced when mesenchymal cells were incorporated
into the assay (Figure 3B), with these effects being more
pronounced when doublet and then triplet chemotherapy
was administered (see online Supplementary Figure S3).
To investigate whether this finding reflected the clinical
chemotherapy response, correlation between the IC50s of
the individual patient cells grown in the 3D-TGA were
determined, in the presence or absence of mesenchymal
cells, with the patient’s TRG (Figure 3C). When
mesenchymal support was present, 100% (n = 14) of the
TRG 4-5 cancers had IC50s higher than the mean peak
serum threshold, and 100% (n = 3) of the TRG 1-3 cancers
had IC50s lower than the mean peak serum threshold
(Figure 4). Without mesenchymal cells incorporated in
the 3D-TGA model, the assay had no predictive value:
although all of the TRG 1-3 cancer IC50s remained lower
than the mean peak serum, only 18% (n = 3) of the TRG
4-5 cancers had IC50s higher than the mean peak serum
threshold.

Cultured patient cancer cell phenotype mirrors
primary tumour tissue
The phenotype of the close-to-patient cancer cells
was compared with the corresponding primary patient
cancer by IHC (Figure 2 and Table 2). Like the primary
patient tissues, all were Cytokeratin, EpCam and p53

chemotherapy, whether they were grown with or without
mesenchymal support (Figure 5B).

By examining each drug individually, and their
combinations in the 3D-TGA, it is possible to put
together a more comprehensive picture of their efficacy,
including their individual contribution to the overall effect
of the ECF regimen (Figure 4). Individual drugs at the
concentrations delivered to patients were never effective;
the best drug doublet was Cisplatin/5-Fluorouracil, and
further addition of Epirubicin provided an overall marginal
gain, with a mean IC50 1.4-fold lower for the ECF triplet
than the CF doublet (p < 0.05) (Figure 5A).

The novel HDACi Panobinostat

provides

Panobinostat was efficacious as a single agent,
and while growth with mesenchymal support increased
resistance by 1.3-fold (p < 0.05), IC50s remained within
achievable serum concentrations and were thus still
classified as sensitive (see online Supplementary Figure
S4). When Panobinostat was combined with the SOC
triplet ECF chemotherapy, it resulted in a significantly
enhanced efficacy (p < 0.05) (Figure 5C). Of the 5 patients
(12 samples) that were ECF-resistant, only 2 samples
remained resistant when subjected to ECF + Panobinostat
in combination (Figure 4).

Chemo-sensitivity was unchanged pre and post
neo-adjuvant chemotherapy
Matched patient samples obtained pre- (chemonaïve) and post- (chemo-exposed) neoadjuvant
chemotherapy were all from patients (n = 5) with TRG 4-5
cancers, with remnant tumour bulk at surgical resection.
Analysis showed no significant difference in IC50 chemosensitivity in the 3D-TGA, before or after neo-adjuvant

cancer cells from small biopsies of individual patient

oesophageal cancers, and then assessing growth in a
tumour micro-environment (TME) -relevant 3D assay
which enables direct chemo-sensitivity testing and
screening of novel drugs. Mesenchymal co-culture had
a significant effect; enhancing growth and chemotherapy
drug resistance in the 3D model, resulting in accurate
prediction of chemo-sensitivity for individual patients.
We present here the first published evidence of
a reliable technique to establish individual close-topatient OAC cells and grow them in a TME-relevant
assay, without having to artificially induce immortality
(e.g. using a telomerase approach [20, 21]). Although
requiring careful attention to detail, the method does
not require specialised equipment or materials found
outside of a normal tissue culture laboratory, and could
be scaled to high-throughput processing, [7] to screen for
novel chemotherapeutics effective against this commonly
resistant carcinoma. This is a significant step forward
towards the goal of delivering personalised health care and
personalised oncological therapy in particular. As well as
their use for studying chemo-resistance, there are many
other promising applications for 3D culture including
the study of the cell biology of individual cancers, their
similarities, cellular interactions and the relationship to the
phenotypical heterogeneity of the disease as a whole.
The characteristics of the established lines
matched those of the original patient tissues well, and
interestingly, in the case of TFF3 (a functional protein
secreted from the apical membrane of established mucosa
[22]) demonstrated the requirement for a representative
3D setting. The selective expression of TFF3 in a 3D
TME with mesenchymal support (either in vivo or ex
vivo) would suggest that a resumption of apical-basal
polarisation, cell-cell interactions and environmental cues
(which are absent in monolayer culture) are required for
these close-to-patient cells to return to functional status.
This reinforces the importance of representative 3D
culture, as has been shown in other tissue types, [23] for
the production of relevant assay results.
The increased chemo-resistance in the presence of
mesenchymal cells in the 3D-TGA underlines the overall
importance of the stromal component of the TME, and
paracrine interaction between the tumour epithelial cells
and their support cells, and the importance of including
them in both in vitro and in vivo assays for pre-clinical
drug screening. This study and previous work published by
our group [5] shows that the role of the stromal component
of the TME in influencing the chemo-resistance is both
drug- and individual tumour-dependent. This variation is a
more accurate reflection of the diverse clinical outcomes to
chemotherapy treatment, where OAC patients individually
display variable magnitudes of response to individual
drugs and the SOC therapy. [10]
The 3D assay using close-to-patient cancer cells
co-cultured with mesenchymal cells provides a clinicallyrelevant assessment of patient sensitivity to the ECF
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

chemotherapeutic agents, accurately predicting individual
clinical chemo-therapeutic response with a sensitivity and
specificity of 100%. Although numbers are small, this is
a particularly exciting finding, as attempts to correlate
laboratory chemo-therapeutic outcomes to individual
patient clinical response and provide personalised
chemotherapy have previously been unsuccessful. [24, 25]
Corresponding survival data would be helpful for clinical
application, but has not been reported as it is immature and
remains difficult to interpret for a group of this size.
Using standard chemotherapy agents alone, the
drug triplet of ECF was the most effective regimen
evaluated in the 3D-TGA, closely followed by the
Cisplatin/Fluorouracil (5-FU) doublet, which reflects
the apparent increased efficacy of the peri-operative
ECF triplet over the pre-operative Cisplatin/5-FU
doublet observed in clinical practice. [26] However in
a head-to-head clinical evaluation, the marginal gain in
chemotherapy-efficacy seen from addition of Epirubicin
to Cisplatin/5-FU (improved TRG, progression & disease
free survival, but not overall survival) is offset by both a
significant increase in the toxic side-effects from receiving
triplet chemotherapy, and a reduced number of patients
completing chemotherapy cycles. [27] This oesophageal
3D-TGA, therefore, has a key role to play: for example, in
this study the 3D-TGA results suggest that patients Oes1
and Oes3 may not require the addition of Epirubicin to
the Cisplatin/5-FU doublet to achieve sensitivity, whilst
patient Oes2 may require triplet ECF chemotherapy to
accomplish chemo-sensitivity (Figure 4). The oesophageal
3D-TGA not only allows identification of patients who
will potentially not benefit from the SOC chemotherapy,
but those that may benefit from a tailored chemotherapy
regimen, with reduced exposure to unnecessary or
ineffective drugs and their associated side-effects.
The absence of change in chemo-sensitivity
between chemo-naïve and matched chemo-exposed
patient samples was initially surprising, since the
neoadjuvant chemotherapy might be expected to select
for increased chemo-resistant clones. However, the preand post-treatment samples tested were all from patients
in which the primary tumours were graded TRG 4-5 and
therefore already chemo-resistant. The 3D-TGA result
is thus reflective of the clinical observation that patients
who do not respond to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (with
a TRG of 4-5) do not have improved survival outcomes
with further rounds of the same chemotherapy postoperatively. [10] Although there was no material change
in chemo-sensitivity, three of the five patients who had
samples obtained pre- and post-chemotherapy (including
one patient with 2 biopsy samples taken) had mismatched
CD44/ ALDH expression pre- and post-chemotherapy.
This could be influenced by clonal selection following
exposure to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and may also be
indicative of the time interval and spatial heterogeneity
within the tumour tissue itself.

The 3D-TGA can also be used to assess novel drugs,
alone or in combination with SOC, across a panel of
individual patient cancer cells, for potential translation into
clinical practice. Panobinostat is a novel HDACi which
has recently undergone accelerated FDA approval for use
in myeloma [28]. It is also in multiple phase II and phase
III trials currently, as it has a broad spectrum of action
against common cancers, [29] at a lower dose than the
other current FDA/EMA-approved HDACi. [30] We tested
Panobinostat in the oesophageal 3D-TGA, as it has been
shown to be effective in a range of solid tumours [29],
and in combination with ECF because it has been shown
to potentiate the action of anthracyclines (e.g Epirubicin),
[31] which are part of the current SOC therapy. The
strikingly improved efficacy against oesophageal tumours
in our 3D-TGA, shown by combining Panobinostat with
the SOC treatment is an exciting prospect. It converted
50% of the previously chemotherapy resistant patient
tumour samples into chemo-sensitive responders,
suggesting that a future clinical regimen with a HDACi
such as Panobinostat, may provide an avenue for more
successful global treatment of this frequently chemoresistant tumour type.
Despite the overwhelming evidence that in vitro 3D
tumour cell cultures more accurately reflect the complex
in vivo TME than simple two-dimensional cell monolayers
(with respect to gene expression profiles, signalling
pathway activity and drug sensitivity [32]), there is still
a need for further development and refinement to achieve
more accurate 3D cell models of disease, for more
clinically-relevant drug screening and in particular using
close-to-patient tumour cells and incorporating supporting
stromal cells. [33] Using close-to-patient cells is important
as it has been shown that the multi-drug resistance
transcriptome of cancer cell-lines, bear more resemblance
to each other, regardless of the tissue of origin, than to the
clinical tumour samples that they are meant to represent.
[34] Organotypic modelling, [35, 36] xenografts, [37, 38]
and spheroid culture [16, 39] have all been attempted to
study oesophageal cancer in a more relevant setting, and
in some cases using cancer cells taken directly from the
patient. [40, 41] The organoid culture system has also
shown much promise for modelling the stem cell niche,
particularly in colorectal cancer. [42] However, we have
demonstrated the importance of including human stromal
mesenchymal cells in the context of studying drug
sensitivity, and this is frequently missing in cancer models
used for drug discovery. [43]
Although mesenchymal cell induced cancer
progression and chemo-resistance has been previously
reliably described in both different environments and
tumour types, there is a lack of conclusive evidence
about the chief mechanisms by which stromal cells
(such as mesenchymal and cancer associated fibroblast
(CAF) cells) induce these effects [44]. Stroma-cancer
cell interactions can be broadly considered as direct
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

cell contact [45-48], secreted signalling factors [49-51],
or hypoxia-driven [52, 53]. Clearly although MSCs are
potent mediators of resistance to chemotherapy, the key
factors and mechanisms in the tumour microenvironment
(including in OAC), have yet to be fully identified. This
maybe because the cross-talk between stromal cells and
cancer cells is complex and context-dependent, may differ
between micro-environments and cancer types, and be
adaptive in response to the selection pressure applied by
chemotherapeutics [54].
We believe that the 3D-TGA model described herein, using close-to-patient epithelial tissue, a humanised
TME, biologically-active 3D matrix and mesenchymal
stromal support cells, reproduces some of the key microenvironmental components of the human tumour. Other
cell types (for example, cells of the immune system and
vascular endothelial cells) may also provide important
signals in the case of some individual tumours, so further
refinement will be required to model other influences
on drug sensitivity or oesophageal tumour biology.
However, the correlation between the in vitro 3D-TGA
assessment of chemo-sensitivity and the observed clinical
response described here, demonstrates that in its current
format, it is already a useful tool. To demonstrate its
clinical applicability for providing tailored treatment for
individual patients, our findings will require confirmation
in an expanded cohort. However, in its current format,
this novel method of expanding individual patient
oesophageal cancer cells in the laboratory and using them
for drug screening, has potential for both reducing the
use of animals in the early stages of drug development
(due to availability of a more clinically-relevant in vitro
assay), and has potential to have a significant impact on
clinical outcomes by enabling accurate identification of
new treatments, in a more cost-effective manner, including
those targeting the stroma.

Establishing close-to-patient cells using a feeder
layer method
Endoscopic tumour biopsies (REC: 10/H0401/80)
and fresh surgical specimens (REC: 10/H0405/6) were
collected with informed consent from patients at the
Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust in 201424231

Oncotarget

2015, and used in accordance with National Research
Ethics Service approval. Chemo-naïve tumour biopsies
were taken from patients (Oes1B, Oes2B etc) undergoing
standard oesophageal cancer endoscopic staging
examinations, either at oesophagogastroduodenoscopy
or at endoscopic ultra-sound, or both; resulting in two
chemo-naïve samples from the same patient (designated
for example as Oes5B(i) for first biopsy, Oes5B(ii) for
second biopsy). If disease stage allowed treatment with
curative intent, patients subsequently underwent routine
neo-adjuvant chemotherapy (3 cycles of anthracycline,
platinum and fluoropyrimidine) before definitive surgical
resection of their oesophageal tumour. A matching
chemotherapy-exposed tumour specimen was collected
at surgical resection where possible (designated as Oes
R). All resected tumours were examined by a dedicated
team of Consultant Gastrointestinal Histopathologists, and
allocated a TRG from 1-5, as described by Mandard (see
online supplementary table S1). This histopathological
grading of chemotherapy response in oesophageal
cancer, (where TRG 1-3 cancers are considered chemosensitive and TRG 4-5 chemo-resistant) directly relates to
prognosis. [3, 55]
The tissue specimens were transferred from
the hospital to the laboratory, and then processed and
disaggregated to produce a cellular suspension (see
online supplementary method S1). In vitro tumour cell
growth was then established and expanded with a layer
of supporting feeder cells according to the method
of Liu et al. [56] From this early passage material, the
tumour epithelial cells were expanded and harvested
separately from the cancer associated fibroblasts using
differential trypsinisation. Tumour cell number and
viability was determined using trypan blue exclusion
and analysed by flow cytometry for expression of the
epithelial marker, EpCam (see online supplementary
method S2). At less than passage 5, cell aliquots were
cryopreserved, utilised for the 3D-TGA, xenografted to
study tumourigenicity (see online supplementary method
S3), and formalin fixed before being embedded in agarose
for immunohistochemical analysis.

or gastro-oesophageal junction (GOJ); b) completed all
3 cycles of neo-adjuvant chemotherapy, without dose
reductions; c) underwent definitive surgery and were
assigned a TRG; d) an in vitro patient line was established
for the paired chemo-exposed tumour (where tissue was
available).

3D-tumour growth assay
The individual patient’s epithelial cells, were
co-cultured in the 3D-TGA with or without human
mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC) in a modified Cultrex®
basement membrane extract (BME) (Trevigen, MD, USA),
using serum-free conditions, with a human tissue reflective
pH and glucose (see online supplementary method S4), as
previously reported. [5] Cellular metabolism and growth
was assessed with an alamarBlue® cell fluorescence
assay (ThermoFisher Scientific, Loughborough, UK) and
measured on a fluorescent plate reader (excitation 560 nm,
emission 588 nm, Flex Station II, Molecular Devices).To
enable separate assessment of the co-cultured cells within
the 3D-TGA, hMSCs constitutively expressing the red
fluorescent protein mCherry were generated (see online
supplementary method S5). The mCherry-labelled hMSC
component of the 3D-TGA was measured separately by
the fluorescent plate reader (excitation 553 nm, emission
613 nm).

Pharmacological assessment
The standard chemotherapy regimen used for
oesophageal adenocarcinoma (OAC) in the UK and
administered to the patients in this study, is Epirubicin,
Cisplatin and 5-Fluorouracil/Capecitabine (ECF) pre- and
post-operatively, [2] and so this regimen was replicated
in the 3D-TGA (see online supplementary table S2).
The novel histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) drug,
Panobinostat, was also assessed to evaluate the 3D-TGA
as a potential platform for appraisal of new drugs, with
assessment of new drug efficacy and in combination with
the current ECF standard-of-care (SOC), for potential
translation into clinical practice. Following the addition
of drugs to the cancer cell clusters in the 3D-TGA, the
chemo-toxic effect was calculated as a percentage of the
matched untreated control. IC50 curves were generated
for the drugs both individually and in combination, as
previously described by our group, [5] using the ChouTalalay method. [57] The mean peak serum concentration
achieved in patients for each drug (Epirubicin 4.5 µM,
Cisplatin 4.3 µM, 5-Fluorouracil & Capecitabine 4.6 µM;
see online supplementary table S2) was compared with
the IC50 values, and chemo-response was thus defined as
sensitive, borderline (+/- 10% of the mean peak serum),
or resistant.

Study inclusion criteria
Tumour biopsies were collected from patients
early in their diagnostic and staging pathway, however
due to subsequent staging with advanced disease,
poor performance status preventing chemotherapy, or
intolerance of the chemotherapy regimen, two-thirds
of these patients did not undergo the full curative
therapy regimen, and therefore did not have a clinical
chemotherapy response to compare with the ex vivo result.
The following inclusion criteria for pharmacological
assessment in the 3D-TGA were required to ensure that
the study population was undergoing comparable curative
treatment: a) adenocarcinomas of the lower oesophagus

Imaging and staining of the 3D-TGA

Abbreviations

Serial bright-field and immunofluorescent images
of the co-cultured mCherry-labelled hMSCs and cancer
cell clusters were obtained at day 0, 3 and 7, using
a Nikon Eclipse Ti-E microscope with differential
interference contrast (DIC). Forty z-stacks were taken
throughout the depth of the well, and extended depth of
field projection picture was produced using the Nikon
NIS Elements software, allowing a condensed view of
the three-dimensional profile of the cancer cell clusters.
On day 7, cell clusters from the 3D-TGA were extracted
using the standard method, [58] and immuno-stained as
previously reported, [5] with Trefoil Factor 3 (TFF3,
Abcam), AlexFluor488 (ThermoFisher Scientific) and
mounted in Prolog Gold Anti-fade containing DAPI
(ThermoFisher Scientific). Immunofluorescent images of
the stained clusters were obtained with the Nikon Eclipse
Ti-E microscope and NIS Elements Advanced Research
Software.

Immunohistochemistry characterisation
Tumour tissue and the agarose-embedded closeto-patient cancer cells were formalin fixed and paraffin
embedded (FFPE) before 4 μm sections were cut for
both H&E and immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis.
IHC was performed using standard techniques and
in line with the manufacturer’s instructions for the
following primary antibodies: Cytokeratin (MNF116,
DAKO), EpCam (Ber-EP4, DAKO), CD44 (DF1485,
DAKO), p53 (DO-7, DAKO), Vimentin (V9, DAKO),
TFF3 (Abcam), and ALDH1A1 (EP1933Y, Abcam) (see
online supplementary method S6). Sections were viewed
with a Leica DMLB Bright-field Microscope (Leicamicrosystems, Milton Keynes, UK) and images acquired
with Leica QWin Standard v3 software. The presence of
any characteristically stained cells was considered positive
with respect to negative controls, and confirmed by a
second blinded individual.
