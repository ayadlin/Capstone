Abstract
Increasing evidence points to the functional importance of alternative splice variations in cancer pathophysiology. Two splice variants are derived from the CASP9 gene via the inclusion (Casp9a) or exclusion
(Casp9b) of a four-exon cassette. Here we show that alternative splicing of Casp9 is dysregulated in non–small
cell lung cancers (NSCLC) regardless of their pathologic classification. Based on these findings we hypothesized that survival pathways activated by oncogenic mutation regulated this mechanism. In contrast to
K-RasV12 expression, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) overexpression or mutation dramatically lowered the Casp9a/9b splice isoform ratio. Moreover, Casp9b downregulation blocked the ability of EGFR mutations to induce anchorage-independent growth. Furthermore, Casp9b expression blocked inhibition of
clonogenic colony formation by erlotinib. Interrogation of oncogenic signaling pathways showed that inhibition of phosphoinositide 3-kinase or Akt dramatically increased the Casp9a/9b ratio in NSCLC cells. Finally,
Akt was found to mediate exclusion of the exon 3,4,5,6 cassette of Casp9 via the phosphorylation state of the
RNA splicing factor SRp30a via serines 199, 201, 227, and 234. Taken together, our findings show that oncogenic factors activating the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt pathway can regulate alternative splicing of Casp9
via a coordinated mechanism involving the phosphorylation of SRp30a. Cancer Res; 70(22); 9185–96. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for >80% of
all lung cancers diagnosed. Thus, there is an urgent need for
further understanding of the molecular mechanisms of
NSCLC, thereby defining new molecular targets for the treatment of this disease (1). In NSCLC, inappropriate activation
of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway by direct
oncogenic mutation or from a K-Ras or epidermal growth
factor receptor (EGFR) mutation has been associated with
the development of NSCLC (2–4). A critical component of
the PI3K nexus is the proto-oncogene Akt, a serine/threonine
kinase. Akt is activated by recruitment to membranes
through direct contact of its PH-domain with PtdIns (3,4,5)
P3 and subsequent phosphorylation on two key residues,
threonine 308 and serine 473. Previously, several laboratories
reported that Akt is constitutively active in NSCLC, and

experimental models have shown that Akt activation contributes to the resistance of NSCLC to chemotherapy.
An important player in the contrasting signaling cascade of
apoptosis, with roles in both the sensitivity of NSCLC to chemotherapy and radiation, is Casp9. Casp9 is a member of the
caspase family of proteases and is activated upon the formation of trimeric complex with cytochrome c and APAF-1,
termed the apoptosome. Casp9 has roles in both the response
of cells to undergo chemotherapy-induced cell death and
the suppression of oncogenic transformation (5–15). The
CASP9 gene produces two antagonistic isoforms, the proapoptotic Casp9a and the prosurvival Casp9b, via the inclusion/
exclusion of an exon 3, 4, 5, 6 cassette (7, 12). The Casp9b isoform (exon exclusion) lacks catalytic activity while retaining
key interacting domains (e.g., CARD; refs. 7, 12). Casp9b acts
as an endogenous inhibitor of Casp9a by competing with the
full-length Casp9a for binding to the apoptosome (7, 12).
Casp9b has also been surmised to directly interact with
Casp9a blocking the autoproteolysis of the enzyme (7). In this
study, Casp9 splicing was shown to be dysregulated in NSCLC
tumors and cell lines, and regulated by the PI3K/Akt pathway.
Furthermore, this study shows that Akt exerts its effects via
the phospho-status of the RNA trans-factor SRp30a.

grown in 50% RPMI 1640 and 50% DMEM supplemented with
L-glutamine, 100 units/mL penicillin G sodium, and 100 μg/mL
streptomycin sulfate. NHBE cells, from Clonetics (Cambrex Bio
Science), were maintained in basal bronchial epithelial growth
media (BEGM) supplemented with SingleQuot Kits-growth factors, cytokines, and supplements (Cambrex). HBEC-3KTs,
HBEC-3KT K-Ras V12 , wild-type EGFR, and mutant EGFR
HBEC-3KT cell lines were previously created and characterized
(16). HBEC3-KT (E746-A750 del EGFR, K-RasV12) cell lines stably expressing control or Casp9b short hairpin RNA (shRNA)
were created using lentivirus followed by selection with
20 ug/mL hygromycin (Lentigen). To generate A549, H838, and
HCC827 cell lines stably expressing Casp9b cDNA, 1.5 × 105 cells
were transfected with pcDNA3.1(-)/Casp9b using Effectene followed by selection with zeocin. For all comparison studies between cell lines, cells were plated in keratinocyte serum-free
medium without supplements overnight prior to analysis.
Quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR
Competitive. Total RNA (1 μg) was reverse-transcribed using
Superscript III and oligo (dT) and analyzed for Casp9, Bcl-x, caspase 8, and caspase 2 splice variants as previously described (17).
Real-time. Total RNA was used for real-time PCR for
Casp9a, Casp9b, and 18s using TaqMan PCR master mix and
the Applied Biosystems 7500 Real-Time PCR System. Casp9a
and 18s Q-PCR primers were ID numbers Hs00154261_m1
and Hs99999901_s1. The Q-PCR primers for Casp9b were
5-TTTGGTGATGTCGGAGCAGA-3′ (forward) and 5′-GATTTGGTGATGTCGGAGCA-3′ (reverse) and 5′-TTCCCCTGAAGACGAGTCCCCTGG-3′ (probe).
Inhibitor studies/adenoviral infection
Cells (1.2 × 105) were infected two hours with constitutively active Akt2, PTEN, or Null adenovirus (50MOI). After
48 hours, total RNA and protein were isolated.
Clonogenic and soft agar assays
For clonogenic assays, 150 viable cells were seeded into
6-well tissue culture dishes with complete growth media.
Two hours postplating, cells were treated with erlonitib.
After 24 hours, cells were rinsed and placed in complete
media for 12 days. Colonies were counted following fixation
with methanol and staining (0.1% crystal violet). For soft agar
assays, cells (103) were prepared as previously described (16).
Phosphorylation assays
Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were scraped
into 150 μL of NP-40 lysis buffer [50 mmol/L Tris-HCL
(pH 8.0), 150 mmol/L NaCl, 1% NP-40,100 ug of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride/mL, and protease inhibitor cocktail]. The
lysates were incubated with 500 U of alkaline phosphatase
for 1 hour at 37°C. Wild-type and mutant SRp30a proteins
were detected using anti-T7 tag antibody.
Western immunoblotting
Immunoblotting was accomplished as previously described (18) using primary antibodies, anti-Casp9 (Assay

antibodies were horseradish peroxidase–conjugated goat
anti-mouse or anti-rabbit (Sigma-Aldrich).
Transfections
The mammalian expression vectors pCGT7-SRp30a-WT
and SRp30a-RD have been previously described (19). To generate SRp30a phospho-mutants, site-directed mutagenesis
was performed using QuikChange XL Site-Directed Mutagenesis protocol. To analyze Casp9 splicing, 1.5 × 104 cells were
transfected with 0.5 μg of pCGT7-SRp30a ± 0.2 μg of the
Casp9 minigene using Effectene as previously described
(17). After 24 hours, RNA and protein were isolated. For
downregulation of Akt1, Akt2, and PDK1, cell lines were
transfected with either Akt1, Akt2, or PDK1 SMARTpool multiplex siRNA or control siRNA (Dharmacon) using Dharmafect 1 as previously described (18). After 48 hours, RNA and
protein were isolated.
Statistical analysis
When appropriate, the data are presented as mean ± SE.
Data points were compared using a two-tailed, unpaired Student's t test, and the P values were calculated. P values < 0.05
were considered significant.

Results and Discussion
Casp9 RNA splicing is dysregulated in NSCLC
tumors and cell lines
In this study, we examined the hypothesis that Casp9 RNA
splicing was dysregulated in all pathologies of NSCLC. Utilizing
total RNA from pathologist-verified human NSCLC samples,
quantitative/competitive reverse transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR)
analysis was performed to determine the degree of dysregulation in the Casp9a/9b ratio as compared with matched,
normal lung tissue controls (Supplementary Table S1; ref. 17).
Tumor samples were categorized into three separate groups:
normal, a Casp9a/9b mRNA ratio of >3.3; moderately dysregulated, a Casp9a/9b mRNA ratio of 2.3:3.3; and highly dysregulated, a Casp9a/9b mRNA ratio <2.3 (Fig. 1A and B). The
normal group corresponds to the normal ratio of Casp9a/9b
mRNA observed in nontransformed cells; the moderately
dysregulated group corresponds to a ratio of Casp9a/9b reported to have a significant, but minor effect on Casp9 activity
(15, 20); and the highly dysregulated group corresponds to a
ratio of Casp9a/9b reported to significantly reduce Casp9
activity and inhibit the association of Casp9a with APAF-1
(15, 17, 20). Analysis (18, 21–23) of Casp9 splice variants showed
that 36% of NSCLCs examined presented a moderately dysregulated Casp9a/9b mRNA ratio (n = 149). Importantly,
42% of tumors showed a >50% decrease in the Casp9a/9b
ratio. Thus, the ratio of Casp9a/9b mRNA is significantly
lower in a high percentage of NSCLC tumors irrespective of
NSCLC subtype.

conditions showed a significant decrease in the Casp9a/9b
mRNA ratio. Importantly, the disproportionate ratio of
Casp9a/9b mRNA observed in the transformed lung epithelial cell lines translated to a disproportionate ratio of Casp9a/
9b protein expression (Fig. 1D). We further validated the
decrease in the Casp9a/9b mRNA ratio of A549s in comparison with HBEC-3KTs via quantitative PCR (Q-PCR; Supplementary Fig. S1), reconfirming the quantitative nature of the
assay as also previously shown by ribonuclease protection
assay (21). These data indicate that a significant portion of
NSCLC tumors and transformed lung epithelial cells show
severe dysregulation of the alternative splicing of Casp9 to
favor a prosurvival/pro-oncogenic phenotype.
The EGF pathway regulates Casp9 RNA splicing
in a pro-oncogenic fashion
In essentially all epithelial cancers, including NSCLC, one
or more members of the family of EGFR genes are either
overexpressed or mutated (4). As a large percentage of
NSCLC tumors and cell lines showed a dysregulated ratio
of Casp9a/9b, we next examined whether this common oncogene in NSCLC affected Casp9 RNA splicing in HBEC-3KT
cells. Whereas low expression of K-RasV12 in HBEC-3KT cells
(16) had no discernable effect on the ratio of Casp9a/9b
mRNA, the overexpression of wild-type EGFR, the expression
of L858R mutation in EGFR, and the expression of the del
E746-A750 EGFR mutant induced a significant reduction in
the Casp9a/9b ratio (Fig. 2A). These HBEC-3KT cell lines
expressing either wild-type or mutant EGFR have previously
been reported to exhibit enhanced phosphorylation of EGFR
in the absence of EGF, in contrast to HBEC-3KTs expressing
K-RasV12 (16). We also reconfirmed these previous findings
showing increased phosphorylation of AKT in HBEC-3KT
cells expressing wild-type or mutant EGFR, as well as showing an increase in the phosphorylation of extracellular signalregulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) in HBEC-3KT cells expressing
K-RasV12 (Supplementary Fig. S2A, B). Importantly, the del
E746-A750 mutation of EGFR induced the most significant
decrease in the Casp9a/9b ratio correlating with the ability
of this EGFR mutant to induce anchorage-independent
growth (AIG; ref. 16). Therefore, we hypothesized that
increased expression of Casp9b was a major mechanism in
conferring AIG of HBEC-3KT ΔE746-A750 del cells. To test
this hypothesis, an E746-A750 del EGFR clonal cell line
(HBEC-3KT Δ746/C9b-dr) stably expressing Casp9b shRNA
was produced. The expression of Casp9b in the HBEC-3KT
Δ746/C9b-dr clonal cell line was reduced to normal immunoreactive levels, and presented with a normal Casp9a/
Casp9b ratio (Fig. 2B). Importantly, the HBEC-3KT Δ746/
C9b-dr cells showed a complete loss of AIG compared with
E746-A750 del EGFR cells stably expressing control shRNA
(Fig. 2C). These effects did not require stable expression
and were not due to integration artifacts as short-term/
transient downregulation of Casp9b also inhibited the AIG
of E746-A750 del EGFR cells (Fig. 2D and E). Furthermore,
K-RasV12-expressing HBEC-3KT cells with Casp9b downregulated exhibited no difference in their AIG capacity, showing
specificity for oncogenic EGFR (Supplementary Fig. S3).

Thus, the distal mechanism of Casp9 splicing plays a major
and specific role in the ability of EGFR signaling to confer
AIG. The significance of this finding stems from the knowledge that EGFR mutation occurs in a large percentage of
NSCLCs, roughly 5% to 10%, and overexpressed EGFR and
its ligands occur in approximately 70% of NSCLCs. Interestingly, EGFR mutation/overexpression is also considered an
early event in NSCLC because the mutation is also found
in normal epithelial cells prior to metaplasia and adenoma
formation, rationalizing the hypothesis that the alternative
splicing of Casp9 plays a role in early events leading to the
formation of NSCLC.
Modulation of Casp9 RNA splicing regulates the ability of
erlotinib to inhibit the colony formation of NSCLC cells
Based on the above data, we were prompted to investigate
the effect of erlotinib, a clinically relevant inhibitor of the
human EGFR, on the Casp9a/9b ratio. Treatment of A549,
H838, H460, and HCC827 cells with erlotinib led to a dosedependent increase in the Casp9a/9b ratio (Fig. 3A). We further validated the increase in the Casp9a/9b ratio via Q-PCR
(Supplementary Fig. S4A and B). Additionally, the effectiveness of erlotinib treatment was shown by loss of Akt phosphorylation (Supplementary Fig. S4C). Next, the effect of
lowering the Casp9a/9b ratio on the sensitivity of A549 cells
to erlotinib was examined. Low ectopic expression of Casp9b
dramatically inhibited the ability of erlotinib to suppress cell
survival (e.g., induced a resistant phenotype; Fig. 3B). In contrast, downregulation of Casp9b sensitized A549 cells to
erlotinib as shown by a dramatic reduction in the IC 50
(14.9 μmol/L for control shRNA to 4.8 μmol/L for C9b shRNA;
Fig. 3B). To determine translatability, the effect of lowering
the Casp9a/9b ratio on the sensitivity of H838 and HCC827
cells to erlotinib was also examined. H838 cells ectopically
expressing Casp9b cDNA significantly inhibited the ability
of erlotinib to suppress cell survival increasing the IC 50
(8.5 μmol/L for vector control to 22.2 μmol/L for C9b cDNA;
Fig. 3C). Conversely, downregulation of Casp9b sensitized
H838s to erlotinib, reducing the IC50 to 2.9 μmol/L for C9b
shRNA cells (Fig. 3C). Additionally, these same effects translated to HCC827 cells, a cell line that has been reported to be
highly sensitive to erlotinib-induced growth inhibition (24).
Specifically, HCC827 cells ectopically expressing Casp9b cDNA
showed an increase in the IC50 of erlotinib (22.2 nmol/L for vector control to 89.9 nmol/L for C9b cDNA; Fig. 3D). Conversely,
downregulation of Casp9b reduced the IC50 to 11.7 nmol/L for
C9b shRNA cells (Fig. 3D). Thus, Casp9 RNA splicing plays
a major role in the sensitivity of NSCLC cells to erlotinib. As
erlotinib has shown promise in clinical trials, significantly
improving the survival rate of NSCLC patients (25, 26), examining the alternative splicing of Casp9 may have future predictive/
prognostic value for a subset of patients or allow for determination of erlotinib responsiveness in NSCLC tumors.
The PI3K/PDK1/Akt pathway regulates Casp9

pathway activated by EGFR regulates Casp9 RNA splicing

to favor the production of Casp9b. To investigate this hypothesis, mitogenic pathways were examined for effects on the
ratio of Casp9a/9b utilizing small-molecule inhibitors at
doses/times reported in the scientific literature for A549 cells
(27–33). Only treatment with the PI3K inhibitor LY 294002
(50 μmol/L) resulted in a significant increase in the ratio of
Casp9a/9b, compared with the inactive, structurally related
compound LY303511 (Fig. 4A, Supplementary Table S3). Specifically, the Casp9a/9b ratio increased from 2.10 ± 0.18 for
control samples to 3.91 ± 0.08 for inhibitor-treated samples
(P < 0.0008; n = 6). The inhibition of PI3K effectively returned
the Casp9a/9b ratio to the ratio observed in nontransformed
lung epithelial cells. Importantly, this effect on the Casp9a/9b
ratio translated to the protein level (Fig. 4A).
To determine translatability, H838, H2030, H358, H292, and
H520 cells were also treated with LY294002 (Fig. 4B). Again,

the Casp9a/9b ratio was dramatically increased (H838 cells
from 1.24 ± 0.05 to 3.29 ± 0.19; H2030 cells from 2.30 ± 0.08
to 3.74 ± 0.08; H358 cells from 3.11 ± 0.09 to 4.13 ± 0.12; H292
cells from 2.01 ± 0.09 to 4.11 ± 0.11; and H520 cells from
2.35 ± 0.08 to 3.91 ± 0.13). Therefore, the ability of the PI3K
pathway to regulate the alternative splicing of Casp9 translates to multiple NSCLC cell lines.
Akt/PKB, SGK, PKCξ, and PKCδ are downstream of PI3K
(34). To investigate the downstream effector of PI3K responsible for regulating Casp9 RNA splicing, small-molecule inhibitors in conjunction with RNA interference technology was
employed. Treatment of A549 cells with the PKC inhibitors
GÖ6976 (10 μmol/L) and GÖ6983 (10 μmol/L; Supplementary
Fig. S5A and B, Supplementary Table S3) resulted in no significant change in the Casp9a/b ratio. Conversely, treatment of

a significantly increased Casp9a/9b ratio, from 2.25 ± 0.13

stream signaling pathways, the phosphorylation status of
Akt was examined via Western immunoblotting (Supplementary Fig. S6A–C).
These data show that Akt regulates Casp9 RNA splicing in
an antiapoptotic/prosurvival manner. This effect was specific
for Casp9 RNA splicing, and not a generalized effect on constitutive RNA splicing, as no effect on the alternative splicing
of caspase 8, caspase 2, and Bcl-x pre-mRNA was observed
with Akt VIII treatment (Fig. 4G). Furthermore, cotreatment
of A549 cells with both Akt VIII and LY294002 could not
further increase the Casp9a/9b ratio, showing a linear pathway

with Akt as the downstream effector of PI3K (Supplementary
Fig. S7).
To examine the Akt isoform responsible for regulating the
alternative splicing, siRNA was again utilized. Downregulation of Akt1 using multiplex siRNA resulted in no significant
change in the Casp9a/b ratio (P > 0.34; Fig. 5A). In contrast,
downregulation of Akt2 resulted in a dramatic increase in
the Casp9a/b ratio from 2.10 ± 0.05 to 4.09 ± 0.25 (P < 0.01;
n = 5; Fig. 5B). Again, this effect translated to the protein level
(Fig. 5C).
To further validate a role for Akt2, expression of constitutively active Akt2 (always membrane bound via myristoylation) induced a significant decrease in the Casp9a/9b ratio
(Fig. 5D). Furthermore, ectopic expression of PTEN induced
the contrasting effect (Fig. 5E). Therefore, Akt2 regulates

Casp9 RNA splicing via PIP 3 membrane interactions in
A549 cells, and also requires PDK1 phosphorylation.
To determine translatability, H2030, H292, H358, H520,
and HCC827 cells were treated with Akt VIII. Indeed, all cell
lines also showed a dramatic increase in the Casp9a/9b ratio
(Fig. 5F). Additionally, Akt1 and Akt2 were downregulated in
H358 cells to determine the Akt isoform responsible for regulating Casp9 RNA splicing. In contrast to A549s, downregulation of Akt1, but not Akt2, induced a significant increase
in the Casp9a/9b ratio (Fig. 5G). Therefore, multiple Akt isoforms have the potential to regulate Casp9 RNA splicing in
NSCLC cells.
Lastly, as with the NSCLC cell lines, the ability of del 746750 EGFR mutation to induce a lowering of the Casp9a/9b
ratio in HBEC-3KT cells was dependent on PI3K and Akt

as treatment with LY294002 and Akt VIII increased the ratio
of Casp9a/9b (Fig. 6A and B). These data suggest that EGFR
overexpression/mutation correlates with Akt activation
affecting the alternative splicing of Casp9. We further extended these results by examining the Akt isoform responsible for regulating Casp9 RNA splicing in HBEC-3KT (del
E746-A750 EGFR) cells. Interestingly, siRNA against both
Akt1 and Akt2 (Fig. 6C) resulted in a significantly increased
Casp9a/Casp9b ratio as compared with control siRNA, from
2.65 ± 0.05 for siRNA control to 4.01 ± 0.13 for siAkt1 (n = 3;
P < 0.01) and to 3.72 ± 0.11 for siAkt2 (n = 3; P < 0.01). Therefore, multiple Akt isoforms are responsible for regulating
the alternative splicing of Casp9. The finding that the Akt
pathway regulates this splicing mechanism important for
EGFR conferring AIG makes logical sense in relation to cellular transformation, as this pathway is found constitutively
active in approximately 58% of NSCLC cell lines and tumors
(35, 36). This pathway is also linked to constitutive EGFR
activity, NF-κB activation, and the ability of oncogenic Ras
to transform various cell types (37–39). Thus, the Akt pathway activated by EGFR is extremely important in a therapeutic sense, and this study suggests that the alternative splicing
of Casp9 is a key distal mechanism in the biological role of
this pathway in NSCLC development/maintenance.
How Casp9b acts to drive AIG is more of an enigma. As we
have shown, removal of Casp9b blocked the ability of EGFR
(del E746-A750) to induce AIG. This is likely not attributed
to the blockade of an initiator caspase such as Casp9a, and
suggests a role in cell signaling for Casp9b. In this regard, the
possibility that Casp9b acts as a signaling molecule has been
reported by Latchman and coworkers (5). Specifically, this
laboratory group showed that ectopic expression of Casp9b
induced the activation of NF-κB irrespective of caspase activation (5). Activation of NF-κB by Casp9b expression also
“fits” well with cooperation with K-Ras mutations for the
induction of cellular transformation based on the findings
of Ma and Baldwin (40, 41). These laboratory groups showed
in several different ways that NF-κB activation enhances the
ability of oncogenic ras to induce cellular transformation.
Coupled with the knowledge that EGFR overexpression/
mutation leads to both cooperation with oncogenic ras in
cellular transformation and NF-κB activation, a role for
Casp9b in these pathways important for cellular transformation is logical. Thus, Casp9b may act as a scaffolding protein
to elicit downstream signaling events with roles outside the
simple inactivation of Casp9a. This possibility is far from
inconceivable as the initiator caspase, caspase 8, is reported
to recruit cell survival factors such as PI3K subunits (42–44).
Although this caspase is an initiator of extrinsic pathways
of apoptosis, Casp9b may play an analogous role in survival
signaling as an initiator of the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis.
The phospho-status of SRp30a modulates the effect
of Akt signaling on Casp9 RNA splicing
Our laboratory reported that SRp30a was a required enhancer factor for the inclusion of the exon 3,4,5,6 cassette
of Casp9 (18). Furthermore, SRp30a has been shown to be
a specific target of Akt in vitro (45, 46). Therefore, we hypo-

thesized that the phospho-status of SRp30a regulates the
inclusion of the exon 3,4,5,6 cassette of Casp9, downstream
of Akt activation. To investigate this hypothesis, we employed
an established phospho-mimic of SRp30a, SRp30a-RD, in
which the majority of serine residues in the RS domain were
mutated to aspartic acid (19). Coexpression of SRp30a-RD
with a functional Casp9 minigene induced a significant
decrease in the Casp9a/9b ratio compared with wild-type
SRp30a and empty vector controls (Fig. 7A). Importantly,
expression of SRp30a-RD also induced a significant decrease
in the endogenous Casp9a/9b ratio as compared with wildtype SRp30a and empty vector controls (Fig. 7B).
To determine the serine residue/residues of SRp30a required for regulating the alternative splicing of Casp9, sitedirected replacement mutagenesis was utilized. Multiple
serine residues in the RS domain of SRp30a contain recognized motifs for Akt phosphorylation and numerous residues
have been validated by mass spectrometric analysis (Supplementary Table S4; ref. 45). These serine residues were individually mutated into aspartic acid to produce phospho-mimics
(Supplementary Table S4). Coexpression of only the SRp30aS199D, SRp30a-S201D, SRp30a-S227D, and SRp30a-S234D
mutants with a functional Casp9 minigene decreased the

PI3Kinase/AKT/SRp30a Regulates Casp9 Splicing

Casp9a/9b ratio compared with wild-type SRp30a control
(Fig. 7C).
We extended these results to produce a SRp30a double
phospho-mutant (SRp30a-S199,201D), a SRp30a triple
phospho-mutant (SRp30a-S199,201,234D), and a SRp30a quadruple (SRp30a-QD) mutant harboring serine to aspartic acid
mutations at residues 199, 201, 227, and 234. Expression of
SRp30a double and triple phospho-mutants with the Casp9
minigene further decreased the Casp9a/9b ratio (Supplementary Fig. S8). Ectopic expression of SRp30a-QD induced a reduction in the Casp9a/9b ratio comparable with the SRp30a-RD
mutant. Conversely, a quadruple dephospho-mimic of SRp30a
(SRp30a-QA) induced the opposite effect in A549 cells (Fig. 7D).
These effects could not be due to localization issues as both
SRp30a quadruple mutants are localized in the nucleus and
were expressed in equivalent amounts (Supplementary Fig. S9).
To show that these phospho-sites are hyperphosphorylated in NSCLC, the phosphorylation status of the transiently
expressed SRp30a was analyzed by comparing the electrophoretic migration profiles in the presence of either alkaline
phosphatase (AP) or denatured AP. A dramatic increase in
the migration of SRp30a-WT was observed after treatment
with AP, indicating that this protein is phosphorylated in
A549 cells. In contrast, the migration of SRp30a-QD and
SRp30a-QA after treatment with AP was significantly decreased in comparison with the migration of SRp30a-WT,
indicating that these proteins are phosphorylated to a significantly lesser extent (Fig. 7E). These data show that serines
199, 201, 227, and 234 exist in a phosphorylated state in A549
cells. Moreover, the electrophoretic migration profiles of
A549s and HBEC3-KT cells after transfection with SRp30aWT and SRp30a-QA indicate that SRp30a exists in a decreased phosphorylated state in nontransformed cells versus
NSCLC cells (Fig. 7F).
We extended these results to determine the effect of inhibiting the EGFR/Akt pathway on the phosphorylation status
of SRp30a in A549 cells. As predicted, an increase in the migration of endogenous SRp30a was observed after treatment
with erlotinib (Fig. 7G), as well as after treatment with the
Akt inhibitor Akt VIII (Fig. 7H). To determine whether
the PI3K/Akt pathway regulates Casp9 RNA splicing in
a phospho-SRp30a-dependent manner, SRp30a-QD was expressed in the presence or absence of Akt VIII. In the presence
of SRp30a-QD, Akt VIII was unable to increase the ratio of the
Casp9a/9b to the same extent as compared with wild-type
SRp30a (Fig. 7I). Therefore, the Akt pathway regulates
the alternative splicing of Casp9 at least partially via the
phospho-state of SRp30a on serines 199, 201, 227, and 234.
These data solidify a role for phosphorylation of SRp30a in
regulating the alternative splicing of Casp9, but also suggest

additional regulating mechanisms. In this regard, our laboratory recently found that the RNA trans-factor hnRNP L acts
as a repressor for the inclusion of the exon 3,4,5,6 cassette
of Casp9, and its repressor activity is regulated by the phosphorylation status of Ser52 (17). Thus, we hypothesize that
the EGFR/PI3K/Akt pathway may also regulate the phosphostatus of hnRNP L at Ser52, suggesting a coordinated interplay
between these two trans-factors in regulating the alternative
splicing of Casp9. This possibility is logical, as Lynch and coworkers showed the ability of SRp30a and hnRNP L to directly
compete for binding to the exon 5 regulatory sequence of
CD45 and that this interplay between SRp30a and hnRNPL
influences the extent of exon inclusion (47).
The phospho-state of SRp30a regulating the inclusion of
the exon 3,4,5,6 cassette also fits with our previous findings
that ceramide induced both the dephosphorylation of
SRp30a and the inclusion of the Casp9 exon cassette. SRp30a
was also required for ceramide effects on the inclusion of the
exonic cassette of Casp9. Thus, the regulation of SRp30a
phosphorylation and the alternative splicing of Casp9 may
be a key distal point by which ceramide acts as a tumor suppressing/cell senescence agent as the ceramide signaling and
PI3K/Akt pathway are well established to antagonize each
other (Supplementary Fig. S10).
In conclusion, the presented study reports several major
findings taking a comprehensive approach. First, the dysregulation of the alternative splicing of Casp9 toward a prosurvival phenotype was shown in NSCLC. Second, a survival/
mitogenic/oncogenic pathway involving EGFR, PI3K, and
Akt was shown to regulate this splicing mechanism. Lastly,
the phospho-state of SRp30a was shown to regulate this distal mechanism via Akt signaling. Therefore, the present study
shows a novel and key distal mechanism in NSCLC and provides new target mechanisms for the development of therapeutics to combat the cancer with the highest mortality rate.
