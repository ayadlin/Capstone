Activation of the Glucocorticoid Receptor Is Associated with
Poor Prognosis in Estrogen Receptor-Negative Breast
Cancer

Abstract
Estrogen receptor–negative (ER) breast cancers have limited treatment options and are associated with
earlier relapses. Because glucocorticoid receptor (GR) signaling initiates antiapoptotic pathways in ER breast
cancer cells, we hypothesized that activation of these pathways might be associated with poor prognosis in ER
disease. Here we report findings from a genome-wide study of GR transcriptional targets in a premalignant ER
cell line model of early breast cancer (MCF10A-Myc) and in primary early-stage ER human tumors. Chromatin
immunoprecipitation with massively parallel sequencing (ChIP-seq) coupled to time-course expression profiling
led us to identify epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) pathways as an important aspect associated with
GR activation. We validated these findings by carrying out a meta-analysis of primary breast tumor gene
expression from 1,378 early-stage breast cancer patients with long-term clinical follow-up, confirming that high
levels of GR expression significantly correlated with shorter relapse-free survival in ER patients who were
treated or untreated with adjuvant chemotherapy. Notably, in ERþ breast cancer patients, high levels of GR
expression in tumors were significantly associated with better outcome relative to low levels of GR expression.
Gene expression analysis revealed that ER tumors expressing high GR levels exhibited differential activation of
EMT, cell adhesion, and inflammation pathways. Our findings suggest a direct transcriptional role for GR in
determining the outcome of poor-prognosis ER breast cancers. Cancer Res; 71(20); 6360–70. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
Breast cancer, the most frequent cancer in women, is
generally classified into estrogen receptor–positive (ERþ)
and estrogen receptor–negative (ER) subtypes because of
the strong prognostic and predictive importance of ER-alpha
(1, 2). ER-alpha expression (henceforth, ERþ) is associated
with a significantly lower 5-year recurrence rate in part
because of the effectiveness of ER-targeted treatments (3)
and in part because of a generally more indolent and welldifferentiated phenotype when compared with ER tumors
(2, 4). As a consequence, identifying ER-positivity (usually
through immunohistochemistry or IHC) has become routine
clinical practice. Unfortunately, the progress made in treating
ER breast cancer has been less successful. First, ER tumors
are often intrinsically more aggressive and of higher grade

than ERþ tumors; second, underlying signaling pathways
driving ER breast cancer have been difficult to identify in
part because of ER tumor heterogeneity. Compared with ERþ
tumors, relatively few prevention and treatment strategies are
available for ER breast cancer patients (5, 6). Until recently,
the only clinically effective treatment for ER breast cancer
was cytotoxic chemotherapy. More recently, antiangiogenic
and PARP inhibitors have been explored as treatments for ER
breast cancer (7), although their ultimate effectiveness in the
ER breast cancer subgroup is not yet clear. Despite the fact
that many "triple-negative" [i.e., ER, progesterone receptor–
negative (PR), and HER2] breast cancers are highly sensitive
to chemotherapy, a significant proportion show resistance to
chemotherapy and progress rapidly (8).
Recently, the stress hormone (glucocorticoid) receptor (GR)
was shown to play an important role in breast epithelial and
breast cancer cell biology, particularly in ER premalignant
and breast cancer cell lines (9–11). Using ER/GRþ breast
epithelial and cancer cell lines (e.g., MCF10A-Myc and MDAMB-231) and global gene expression studies, our laboratory
identified several GR-regulated target genes whose protein
products mediate cell survival, including serine/threonineprotein kinase 1 (SGK1; ref. 12) and the dual specificity protein
phosphatase 1 (DUSP1/MKP1; ref. 13). In addition, using a
mouse xenograft model of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell
tumor growth, we found that tumor cell apoptosis induced by
paclitaxel is inhibited by pretreatment with systemic dexamethasone (dex, a synthetic glucocorticoid; ref. 14). We also

GR in ER-Negative Breast Cancer

discovered that increased endogenous glucocorticoid
exposure is associated with greater ER mammary tumor
growth in the C3(1) SV40 Tag transgenic mouse model of
ER/PR/GRþ invasive breast cancer (15). These observations
suggest that GR signaling may be an important pathway
influencing ER breast cancer biology.
To further understand the role of GR signaling in ER breast
cancer, we carried out genome-wide GR chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing (ChIP-seq) and time-course gene
expression analysis, using the ER/GRþ premalignant breast
epithelial cell line MCF10A-Myc. We found that GR target
genes were enriched in many cancer-related pathways, including epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), cell adhesion, and cell survival. In addition, to examine whether GRmediated gene expression associates with worse outcome in
ER breast cancer patients, we compiled and analyzed a metadataset of early-stage breast cancer patients with associated
tumor gene expression and long-term clinical outcome data.
In this retrospective analysis of primary tumor gene expression data in 1,378 patients, we found that high GR gene
(NR3C1) expression was associated with a significantly shorter
relapse-free survival (RFS) in both adjuvant chemotherapy–
treated and untreated early-stage ER patients. Unexpectedly,
we also found that in ERþ breast cancer, higher GR expression
was associated with longer RFS. Thus, both the cell line and
primary human tumor data analyses suggest that the GR
directly mediates gene expression pathways associated with
aggressive behavior and early relapse in the ER breast cancer
subtype.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture
Early passage MCF10A-Myc cells were derived from
MCF10A cells (ATCC), transduced with the viral oncogene
c-Myc as previously described (9), and checked for Myc
expression. Cells were cultured in a 1:1 mixture of Dulbecco's
modified Eagle's medium and Ham's F12 (BioWhittaker)
supplemented with hydrocortisone (0.5 mg/mL), human recombinant epidermal growth factor (10 ng/mL), insulin (5 ng/
mL), 5% FBS, 100 units/mL penicillin, and 100 mg/mL streptomycin. Identical conditions were used for gene expression
profiling after dex treatment (16).
GR ChIP assay
MCF10A-Myc cells (1  107) were serum starved for
3 days and then treated with either dex or ethanol for 1
hour as previously described (9). Cellular DNA and protein
were then cross-linked for 20 minutes with formaldehyde
(1% final concentration) followed by addition of glycine to a
final concentration of 125 mmol/L for 5 minutes. We also
took 1% of each lysate to evaluate as input protein and
DNA. ChIP experiments were conducted according to a
standard protocol (Upstate Biotechnology, Millipore).
ChIP-grade rabbit polyclonal anti-GR (sc-1003x; Santa
Cruz) antibodies were used for immunoprecipitation. We
also used normal rabbit IgG (sc-2027; Santa Cruz) as a
negative control.

www.aacrjournals.org

An anti-GR Western blot analysis was carried out on a small
percentage of the input lysate and the anti-GR immunoprecipitate to assess enrichment of GR by the immunoprecipitation process (Supplementary Fig. S1). Cell lysates or
immunoprecipitated complexes were resuspended in 2
Laemmli lysis buffer. The proteins were resolved by SDSPAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, blocked with
5% skim milk in TBS-T (0.1% Tween-20 in TBS), and probed
with a 1:1,000 dilution anti-GR antibody (sc-1003; Santa Cruz).
Goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase (HRP; Santa Cruz;
1:5,000) was used as the secondary antibody. Proteins were
visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham
Pharmacia Biotech). After confirming efficient GR immunoprecipitation (Supplementary Fig. S1A and B), we reversed the
cross-links of the immunoprecipitated protein–chromatin
complexes according to the manufacturer's instructions. ChIP
DNA was then purified by Qiagen's PCR Purification KIT.
Quantitative real-time PCR
To ensure the quality of the anti-GR antibody ChIP'd DNA,
we carried out quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) as
previously described (13) on the promoter regions of SGK1
and TSC22D3/GILZ genes containing established GR binding
regions (GBR; refs. 17, 18). The primers for SGK1's promoter
regions were 50 -CCCCTCCCTTCGCTTGTT-30 (sense) and 50 GGAAGAAGTACAATCTGCATTTCACT-30 (antisense; ref. 19);
the primers for TSC22D3/GILZ's promoter regions were
50 -GATACCAGTTAAGCTCCTGA-30 (sense) and 50 -AGGTGGGAGACAATAATGAT-30 (antisense; ref. 20). Dex- and
ethanol-treated ChIP DNA and input samples were analyzed
in triplicate.
Deep sequencing and data analysis for ChIP-sequencing
After the quality control experiments described earlier
proved to be successful, the GR ChIP DNA was deepsequenced by using Illumina's Solexa sequencer [National
Center for Genome Resources (NCGR)]. We used the Maq
program (version 0.71; ref. 21) to align the resulting sequenced
36-bp tags to the Human Genome (NCBI/b36). Tags that were
mapped to more than one location in the human genome were
removed. The GBRs were identified using the Model-based
analysis of ChIP-Seq (MAC) program (version 1.3.7.1; ref. 22).
Input DNA tags were used to call GBRs.
A P value cutoff of 103 or less was initially used to call the
GBRs in both dex- and ethanol-treated samples. We then
developed more stringent criteria for accurately detecting
significant peak signals based on known GR promoter occupancy regions for the 2 GR target genes, SGK1 (19) and
TSC22D3/GILZ (20). In the initial P  103 GBR dataset, we
found the number of tags per binding region (Ntag) in all the
SGK1 and TSC22D3/GILZ–associated GBRs in ethanol-treated
samples was always 6 or less, whereas Ntag in dex-treated
samples was always 5 or more (see Supplementary Table S1 for
the summary of SGK1 and TSC22D3/GILZ GBR data). Because
ethanol-treated samples should not show significant GR
occupancy for these 2 previously described dex-dependent
GBRs, an Ntag > 6 was determined as the cutoff for removing
non-dex-dependent GBRs associated with ethanol treatment.

Pan et al.

Similarly, we identified log10(P) > 5.8 [the maximum value of
log10(P) in ethanol-treated samples] as the minimum cutoff
for removing likely nonspecific GBRs associated with ethanol
treatment. Therefore, Ntag > 6 and log10(P) > 5.8 became our
lower-bound cutoffs for removing likely false-positive (i.e.,
ethanol-associated) GBRs in the MCF10A-Myc cell ChIP-seq
experiments.
We also validated the dex-dependent GR occupancy of the
same established promoter region GBRs in SGK1 and GILZ,
using a directed ChIP-PCR assay (Supplementary Fig. S1B). In
the same sample subjected to dex-treated ChIP-seq, we found
that the Ntag for these 2 GBRs were 22 (SGK1) and 25 (GILZ).
For the promoter GBR for SGK1 and GILZ, the log10(P) were
13.9 and 15.5, respectively. Both values were much higher than
the lower-bound cutoffs used to filter out ethanol-associated
GBRs (i.e., Ntag > 6 and log10(P) > 5.8). Because SGK1 and
GILZ GBRs are known to have very high GR occupancy, Ntag >
22 and log10(P) > 13.9 were likely overly stringent cutoffs for
genome-wide identification of GBRs. We therefore took the
average of the Ntag for the lower-bound cutoff and for the more
stringent cutoff as the final cutoff [(6 þ 22)/2 ¼ 14], i.e., Ntag 
15]. Likewise we averaged the log10(P) cutoffs to determine
the final cutoff value [(5.8 þ 13.9)/2 ¼ 9.85 and rounded to 10],
that is, log10(P)  10 or P  1010. The final set of GBRs was
then identified by using both Ntag  15 and P  1010.
All other statistical analyses and data plotting were carried
out using the R language. Gene pathways were identified by
MetaCore database and software suite version 6.6 build 28323
(GeneGo Inc.) Enrichment analysis of transcription factor
binding motifs located in GBRs was carried out by TRANSFAC
version 2009.3 (23, 24).
Data analysis for time-course gene expression profiling
Microarray raw data CEL files of the MCF10A-Myc cell timecourse (2, 4, and 24 hours) gene expression profiling following
dex or ethanol treatment (16) were downloaded from the Gene
Expression Omnibus (GEO) database (GEO ID is GSE4917). We
then renormalized and reanalyzed the original data by using
the latest version of Robust Multiarray Average (RMA) method
(25) in the Bioconductor's affy package (26). Up- and down-

regulated genes were identified as those with greater than a
1.5 fold change in the average of dex- or ethanol-treated
values from 3 independent experiments at any one time point.
Compiling and normalizing tumor expression
microarray meta-dataset
Breast cancer gene expression raw data CEL files derived from
early-stage primary tumors with clinical follow-up from 8 wellannotated studies (Table 1) were downloaded from GEO. To
minimize potential cross-platform bias, we used data obtained
only from Affymetrix's U133A and/or U133þ2 platforms
(Affymetrix's U133A and U133þ2 are essentially the same chip
except that U133þ2 contains more probesets than U133A).
Duplicate patient samples were identified by both GEO ID
and gene expression and removed from the dataset. Assuming
that tumor microarray analyses within the same "batch" or
hospital/lab source were carried out under similar conditions,
we first grouped samples by institution. We then used the
normalized unscaled standard error (NUSE) analysis in
Bioconductor's affyPLM package (27, 28) to remove poor quality
arrays within each institutional batch. Next, we carried out an
RMA normalization (25) within each study group, using
Bioconductor's affy package (26) to adjust the background noise.
To remove batch effects between study groups, we carried out a
within-array normalization by subtracting the array average
expression of 5 well-established housekeeping genes (ACTB,
GAPDH, GUSB, RPLP0, and TFRC, altogether 19 probesets) from
the expression of each probeset. We confirmed that the variation
of the mean expression of these 5 housekeeping genes was very
small in individual datasets (all coefficients of variation were less
than 0.03), ensuring that the normalized values were comparable across the groups. A similar normalization strategy for qRTPCR assessment of mRNA has been used on the commercially
available Oncotype DX assay (29).
Determination of ER (ESR1) and GR (NR3C1) expression
in the meta-dataset
We carried out a receiver operating characteristic (ROC)
analysis by using the Bioconductor's genefilter package (30) on
tumors with known ER (IHC) status in the meta-dataset (799

ERþ and 208 ER) and confirmed that the ESR1 205225_at
probeset was most accurate for predicting ER IHC status (ref.
31; Supplementary Fig. S2A). We then calculated the Youden
Index [J ¼ MAX(specificity þ sensitivity  1)] of the 205225_at
probeset ROC curve (32, 33), and took the corresponding
normalized expression of the probe as the cutoff point to
determine ER status. This cutoff value was 3.416, meaning
that if ESR1 expression was greater than 3.416, the tumor
was identified as ESR1þ; otherwise it was considered to be
ESR1.
Because there are no available GR IHC datasets coupled to
gene expression data, we were unable to identify a GR gene
(NR3C1) expression cutoff by using ROC analysis. There are 4
NR3C1 probesets: 201865_x_at, 201866_s_at, 211671_s_at, and
216321_s_at on the Affymetrix's U133A and U133þ2 arrays.
We used 216321_s_at to represent the expression of NR3C1
because (a) only 216321_s_at hybridizes with all NR3C1 mRNA
isoforms (Supplementary Fig. S2B); (b) only the probe
sequences (11 for each probeset) of 216321_s_at and
211671_s_at can be all aligned perfectly (100% score) with
NR3C1 [by BLAT (34), human genome NCBI36/hg18]; (c) on
the basis of BioGPS (35), 216321_s_at shows the most diverse
tissue expression of the 4 probesets. We then used the highest
and lowest quartiles (25%) of NR3C1 probeset expression as a
cutoff to identify "high" and "low" GR (NR3C1) tumor expressions, respectively.
Relapse-free survival and gene pathway analysis for the
meta-dataset
RFS was estimated by using the Kaplan–Meier method. RFS
between groups was compared by using the log-rank test.
Hazard ratios were calculated by using the Cox proportional
hazards regression model. All survival analyses were carried
out by the survival package in R (36).
Genes that were differentially expressed between NR3C1
(GR)-high and NR3C1 (GR)-low tumors were identified by
using Significance Analysis of Microarray (SAM; ref. 37) in
R's siggene package (38). We also used the MetaCore software
suite (GeneGo Inc.) to identify significant gene pathways from
differentially expressed genes between GR-high and GR-low
tumors. All other statistical analyses were done using the R
language.

Results
GR ChIP-sequencing reveals evidence of EMT and
immune gene regulation
To examine the genome-wide GBRs in a model of ER
breast cancer, MCF10A-Myc cells were subjected to GR ChIPseq (39). The genomic locations of the sequence tags obtained
from deep-sequencing were mapped by using the UCSC's
human genome version NCBI36/hg18. The number of
uniquely mapped 36-bp tags was 1.34  107 in the dex-treated
sample and 0.83  107 in the ethanol-treated sample, suggesting significantly more GR binding events following dex treatment. Using our customized threshold values developed from
well-validated GBRs (SGK1 and GILZ), we identified 1,533
GBRs following dex treatment and 126 GBRs following ethanol

MCF10A-Myc cells were treated with dex (106 mol/L) or vehicle for 1 hour

and then mapped to the human genome (NCBI36). The relative percentage

treatment. Eighteen dex-associated GBRs were found within
100 kb of any ethanol-associated GBRs. The remaining 1,515
GBRs seemed to be highly specific for ligand-bound GR (a list
of dex-specific GBRs is provided in Supplementary Table S2).
Figure 1 shows that more than half of these dex-specific 1,515
GBRs were located in intergenic regions. Even within genes,
most of the GBRs were located in introns, showing the typical
distribution of genome-wide binding sites reported previously
for ligand-bound nuclear receptors such as ER-alpha (40). GR
response elements were found in 66% (1,000 of 1,515) of the
dex-dependent GBRs identified, making the canonical GR
binding motifs the third most commonly identified transcription factor. The 10 most common transcription factor motifs
identified by TRANSFAC analysis are shown in Supplementary
Table S3.
GR target gene identification was based on the presence of
at least one GBR within 100 kb of a gene's transcription start
site (TSS). GR target genes were further classified into 2
categories, based on the physical distance of the GBR from
the TSS: (a) 0 to 10 kb (a proximal and traditional "promoter"
location) and (b) 10 to 100 kb (a distal and traditional
"enhancer" location). Using these criteria, 286 target genes
had proximal GBRs and 2,044 genes had distal GBRs; 133 genes
showed GR occupancy in both regions. Therefore, GR binding
occurred more frequently in the distal/enhancer regions of
target genes, although the density of GR occupancy was higher
in the more proximal regions [28.6 (proximal) vs. 22.7 (distal)
hits/kb].
Because GR chromatin occupancy does not guarantee a
transcriptional event, we refined our list of likely direct GR
target genes, using time-course gene expression data from
MCF10A-Myc cells (GEO accession ID is GSE4917; ref. 16). This
represents the steady-state mRNA expression following treatment with dex (106 mol/L) versus ethanol for 2, 4, and 24
hours. In total, 680 genes were significantly regulated (an
average of  1.5 or  1.5 fold change compared with the
ethanol vehicle at any one or more time points). Among them,

Figure 2. Relative percentage of glucocorticoid-regulated genes with proximal (0–10 kb) versus distal (10–100 kb) GBR locations. GR direct target
genes were identified as having at least 1 GBR within 100 kb of the TSS and as showing at least 1.5-fold gene expression change at the designated
time point following treatment with dex (106 mol/L) relative to vehicle. The percentage represents the proportion of (A) upregulated [or (B) downregulated]
genes with associated GBRs mapping within 10 kb (black bars) versus 10 to 100 kb (white bars) of the TSS.

517 genes were upregulated and 163 genes were downregulated. There was no overlap between the gene sets of upregulated and downregulated genes.
By examining the MCF10A-Myc cell line ChIP-seq target
genes and the gene profiling list, we identified 187 overlapping
genes, among which 51 had proximal GBRs, 160 had distal
GBRs, and 24 had both. Putative direct target genes identified
by overlapping the ChIP-seq–identified genes with the gene
profiling lists (either up or downregulated) were compared
with the total number of differentially expressed genes at each
time point (Fig. 2). This revealed a much larger proportion of
directly upregulated genes composing the more immediate 2and 4-hour time points compared with the later 24-hour time
point (Fig. 2A). This finding is consistent with the direct GRmediated transcriptional activation of these earlier genes and
was true regardless of the proximal versus distal location of
the GBR. Interestingly, a much lower proportion of repressed
genes (Fig. 2B) was identified as direct GR target genes. This
suggests that GR more commonly mediates transcriptional
repression through indirect mechanisms (e.g., due to sequestration of activating transcription factors such as NF-kB),
rather than through direct GR occupancy of "repressive" DNA
elements. In the downregulated genes that were identified by
gene expression studies and also showed GR occupancy by
ChIP-seq, the GR bound almost exclusively to regions greater
than 10 kb distal to the TSS, consistent with previous observations in lung cancer cells (41). Finally, unlike upregulated
genes which mainly showed significantly increased expression
2 and 4 hours following dex treatment, the proportion of genes
with downregulated mRNA steady-state levels following GR
activation was approximately equal at all time points, suggesting that the kinetics of GR-mediated gene repression may be
significantly influenced by variable mRNA degradation rates
following repression of gene transcription.
We next carried out a gene enrichment pathway analysis to
identify the functional pathways associated with the 187 GR
"direct" target genes that were identified in the MCF10-A Myc
premalignant breast cancer cell line following GR activation
(Table 2). The top 10 most significant pathways included
GnRH activation, EMT, immune regulation, and proliferation,

6364

Cancer Res; 71(20) October 15, 2011

all of which are critical pathways associated with clinical
outcome in breast cancer. Taken together, the MCF10AMyc cell line data suggested that GR activation directly
regulates genes associated with aggressive breast cancer
biology.
Meta-analysis of primary patient tumor gene
expression
Given the pathways revealed by GR transcriptome analysis
above, and because GR activation in ER breast cancer cell
lines has been shown to promote cell survival, chemotherapy
resistance, and increased tumor growth in a preclinical
xenograft model of human breast cancer (14), we next asked
whether high versus low GR expression in primary breast
cancers is associated with worse outcome in early-stage ER
breast cancer patients. To test this hypothesis, we compiled a
meta-dataset of the 8 publically available Affymetrix gene
expression studies of early-stage primary breast tumors in
patients with long-term clinical follow-up (refs. 42–49; n ¼
1,378, summarized in Table 1).
Because the longer time to relapse in ERþ versus ER
breast cancers suggests clinically different disease entities,
we wished to analyze these tumor subsets independently.
However, ER IHC information was not available for all
tumors; therefore, we used ER-alpha gene (ESR1) expression
to determine ER status. Using the expression of ESR1
probeset 205225_at as determined by ROC analysis (area
under the curve ¼ 0.939), we identified 1,024 ESR1þ and 354
ESR1 tumors. For GR expression, we were not able to
identify a GR gene (NR3C1) expression cutoff using ROC
analysis because there are no publicly available GR IHC
datasets coupled with NR3C1 gene expression data. Published GR IHC studies, however, have shown a range of 15%
to 40% GR-positivity in invasive breast cancers; this variation is likely dependent on tumor subtype, patient age,

described in the Materials and Methods, because most
studies show that at least 25% of breast cancers express
significant GR by IHC, we used the highest and lowest

Genes (n ¼ 187) that were 1.5-fold differentially expressed (upregulated, n ¼ 168; downregulated, n ¼ 19) following glucocorticoid

pathway enrichment, using GeneGO's Metacore Version 6.6 (see Materials and Methods for details).

216321_s_at expression to identify high versus low tumor
GR expression.
Next we used the Kaplan–Meier method to estimate RFS for
patients with NR3C1-high versus NR3C1-low expressing
tumors (Fig. 3). We stratified patients into untreated and
adjuvant-treated (tamoxifen treatment for ESR1þ patients
and adjuvant chemotherapy for ESR1 patients) groups. As
hypothesized, we found that in ESR1 tumors, high NR3C1
expression was indeed associated with significantly worse
outcome in both the untreated (P ¼ 0.001, log-rank test;
HR ¼ 2.23) and adjuvant chemotherapy–treated (P ¼ 5.8e7, log-rank test; HR ¼ 6.83) groups. Because the analysis was
not carried out prospectively, the predictive ability of GR
expression (with respect to chemotherapy) in ER breast
cancer cannot be assessed, but the data suggest that high
GR expression is associated with a relatively poor prognosis
regardless of adjuvant chemotherapy treatment (Fig. 3B and
D). Unexpectedly, we observed the reverse association between high NR3C1 gene expression and clinical outcome in
ESR1þ patients (Fig. 3A and C). In ESR1þ cancer, both untreated (P ¼ 0.03, log-rank test; HR ¼ 0.60) and tamoxifentreated (P ¼ 7.75e-8, log-rank test; HR ¼ 0.25) patients with
high NR3C1 tumors had better outcome compared with
patients with low NR3C1-expressing tumors. Therefore, the
phenotypic context of ER expression seems to reverse the
association of high GR expression with a poor outcome in
breast cancer.
To be certain that these results were not confounded by an
association of NR3C1 expression with the expression of other
receptors used in breast cancer prognosis, we also calculated
the individual correlation coefficients between GR gene expression (216321_s_at) and genes encoding PR, androgen
receptor (AR), and HER2. We found the correlation between
GR expression and other receptors to be weak (Table 3),
making it unlikely that expression of these receptors influenced our results. One of the HER2 probesets (210930_s_at)

www.aacrjournals.org

showed an approximately 30% negative correlation with
NR3C1 expression. The influence of this group of HER2þ
tumors on patient clinical outcome was therefore examined
by excluding those patients in the top HER2 expression
quartile from the ESR1 dataset and then reanalyzing the
remaining patients. Similar results, that is, a significantly
worse prognosis in NR3C1-high tumors, were observed when
we excluded the HER2-high patients (Supplementary Fig. S3),
suggesting that HER2-positivity does not confound the association of high NR3C1 expression with a poor prognosis among
ESR1 patients.
Gene pathways enriched in NR3C1-high versus
NR3C1-low tumors
We next examined the differences in global gene expression
between high GR-expressing versus low GR-expressing tumors
among ERþ and ER breast cancers as determined by tumor
ESR1 expression. We carried out SAM (37) and identified genes
showing a significant difference in expression ( 1.5-fold or
1.5-fold change, false discovery rate 1%) in NR3C1-high
versus NR3C1-low tumors (Fig. 4).
We found that in ESR1þ tumors, 4,069 genes were differentially expressed in NR3C1-high versus NR3C1-low tumors.
Among these genes, 3,488 were significantly upregulated and
581 were downregulated. In ESR1 tumors, 5,170 genes were
significantly differentially expressed, among which 3,209
were upregulated and 1,961 were downregulated. We then
classified these differentially regulated genes into 3 groups:
(a) genes regulated exclusively in ESR1þ tumors (n ¼ 930,
882 upregulated and 48 downregulated); (b) genes regulated
exclusively in ESR1 tumors (n ¼ 2,031, 603 upregulated and
1,428 downregulated); and (c) shared genes commonly regulated in both ESR1 subtypes (n ¼ 3,139, 2,606 upregulated
and 533 downregulated; Fig. 4). Thus, the majority of genes
associated with high NR3C1 expression were shared between
ESR1 and ESR1þ tumors, although there were important

Figure 3. Kaplan–Meier estimates of RFS for early-stage breast cancer patients with NR3C1-high versus NR3C1-low tumors, by ESR1 status. Tumors
in the top quartile of NR3C1 expression were identified as "NR3C1-high," whereas tumors in the bottom quartile of NR3C1 expression were identified
as "NR3C1-low." A, ESR1þ untreated NR3C1-high patients (n ¼ 87) had a better outcome (P ¼ 0.03, log-rank test; HR ¼ 0.60) than NR3C1-low untreated
patients (n ¼ 151). B, ESR1/NR3C1-high patients who did not receive adjuvant chemotherapy (n ¼ 71) had a worse outcome (P ¼ 0.001, log-rank test;
HR ¼ 2.23) than NR3C1-low untreated patients (n ¼ 61). C, ESR1þ/NR3C1-high patients (n ¼ 136) who received adjuvant tamoxifen treatment had a
significantly better outcome (P ¼ 7.75e-8, log-rank test; HR ¼ 0.25) than ESR1þ/NR3C1-low adjuvant tamoxifen treated patients (n ¼ 68).
D, ESR1/NR3C1-high patients who received adjuvant chemotherapy treatment (n ¼ 18) had a significantly worse RFS (P ¼ 5.8e-7, log-rank test;
HR ¼ 6.83) than ESR1/NR3C1-low adjuvant chemotherapy–treated patients (n ¼ 28).

differences among the uniquely expressed genes. For example, the majority of the genes uniquely expressed in ESR1þ
breast cancers were upregulated, whereas in ESR1 tumors,
the majority were downregulated, suggesting an influence of
ER context on modulating the direction of GR-associated
gene expression.
We then carried out a gene enrichment pathway analysis,
using GeneGo's MetaCore software suite, to identify the most
significant GR-associated pathways found in the ESR1þ and
ESR1 breast cancers (Fig. 4). Top pathways that were identified involved EMT, cell adhesion, and immune response.

Somewhat surprisingly, we found that EMT-associated genes
were differentially expressed in both the ESR1þ and ESR1
breast cancer subtypes, suggesting that high GR expression
influences EMT-associated gene expression in an ER-independent fashion. Many cell adhesion pathway genes were also
identified in both ESR1þ and ESR1 breast cancers, but the
majority of genes in these pathways were upregulated in
ESR1þ breast cancer and downregulated in ESR1 tumors.
Interestingly, a significant number of immune response pathway genes were only identified in ESR1 breast cancers,
suggesting that GR-associated modulation of the immune

of differentially expressed genes (either 1.5-fold induced or repressed)
between the highest versus lowest NR3C1 expression quartiles in ESR1þ

biological pathways from these differentially expressed genes in (ESR1)
ERþ and (ESR1) ER tumors.

Overlap of ER cell line and ESR1 primary human
tumor data reveals GR-associated biology
We next asked how the ER cell line data and ESR1 human
primary tumor data compared with respect to overlapping
GR-associated gene expression. We examined genes that were
common to both the 2,031 differentially regulated genes from
ESR1/GR-high tumors (Fig. 4) and the gene set (n ¼ 187)
derived from our cell line ChIP-seq and gene expression data.
We found that 90 genes were identified in both analyses and
likely represented direct GR target genes (Table 4). As hypothesized, these genes encoded antiapoptotic proteins previously identified as critical to GR-mediated tumor cell
survival and chemotherapy resistance such as SGK1 and
DUSP1/MKP1. Unexpectedly, genes encoding proteins central
to EMT (e.g., SNAI2/SLUG), chromatin remodeling (e.g.,
SMARCA2), and epithelial cell–inflammatory cell interactions
(e.g., IL1R1 and PTGDS) were also identified. Thus, the combined cell line and primary human tumor data analysis
suggest that the GR directly mediates pathways associated
with aggressive breast cancer biology. Taken together with the

high recurrence rate found in ER patients with high GRexpressing early breast cancers, these finding suggest that GR
expression may be a useful marker of high-risk early-stage ER
breast cancer as well as a potential therapeutic target in these
cancers.

Discussion
In the clinical treatment of breast cancer, tumors are
initially classified by ER, PR, and HER2 expressions. This
classification guides both therapy and prognosis. Compared
with early-stage ERþ breast cancer, similar stage ER breast
cancer is more aggressive and relapses earlier. In addition,
ER patients have relatively few options for adjuvant treatment because only ERþ patients benefit significantly from
antiestrogen agents (5, 6). As a follow-up to our previous
studies examining the molecular targets of GR activation that
promote cell survival in ER breast epithelial and cancer cells
(12–15), this study identified both genome-wide GR target
genes in an ER breast epithelial cell line and GR-associated
genes in early ER breast cancers. In our meta-analysis of
1,378 early-stage breast cancer patients, we found that
patients with ER/GR-high tumors have significantly increased risk of early relapse compared with patients with
ER/GR-low tumors. Unexpectedly, we also found that high
GR expression was associated with better outcome in ERþ
breast patients, suggesting potential cross-talk between the
ER and GR (52, 53). Recently, loss of the E2F1-associated gene
signature was also found to associate with a reversed prognosis in ERþ versus ER breast cancers, similarly suggesting
the importance of ER expression in the activity and function of
transcriptional networks in breast cancer (54). The unexpected finding of an improved RFS time for breast cancer patients
with GR-high/ERþ tumors may in part be due to antagonism
between ER and GR signaling (55). For example, in ERþ MCF-7
cells, glucocorticoid treatment inhibits the growth-stimulatory effect of estrogen (56, 57). Conversely, ER activation can also
inhibit glucocorticoid action. Specifically, activated ER can
induce the expression of the protein phosphatase 5 (PP5) gene,
which in turn mediates the dephosphorylation and inactivation of the GR at Ser211 (52). Therefore, unlike ER tumors,
where GR regulates genes independently of estrogen and ERalpha action, in ERþ tumors, ER may alter GR action and the
GR may in turn also alter a subset of important ER-regulated
genes involved in tumor growth. This hypothesis will be
explored in further studies examining the role of ligandactivated ER-alpha expression in GR chromatin occupancy
and transcriptional activity.
Analysis of gene expression pathways, based on our metadataset of human tumors, revealed that the EMT pathway is

associated with high GR expression in both ER and ERþ
tumors, suggesting that GR expression may mediate transcriptional activation of fundamental cytoskeletal genes.
Interestingly, however, cell adhesion pathway gene expression
was differently regulated between ER and ERþ tumor subtypes; in ERþ tumors, genes encoding cell adhesion proteins
were generally upregulated whereas in ER tumors they were
downregulated. In contrast, inflammatory and macrophageassociated genes (i.e., immune response) were uniquely identified as differentially expressed only in the ER tumors.
Furthermore, the upregulation of several genes encoding
proteins involved in epithelial cell–macrophage attraction
such as DAP12 and Syk was observed in the gene set common
to both the ER cell line data and ER primary tumor gene
expression. This interesting finding suggests that GR activity
plays an important role in tumor epithelial cell communication with the microenvironment in the ER breast cancer
subtype (58).
On the basis of these findings, the role of GR overexpression
in ER breast cancer should be evaluated prospectively in
trials of early-stage patients undergoing adjuvant therapy.
Eventually, the presence of high GR expression might be a
useful tool to determine a recurrence threshold for employing
systemic treatment in ER patients with less than 1.0 cm
node-negative breast cancer who currently do not routinely
receive adjuvant systemic therapy but appear likely to
relapse if they have the ER/GRþ subtype. Furthermore, GR
expression may represent a novel therapeutic target for
chemotherapy-resistant ER breast cancer that should be
explored with the new second generation specific GR antagonists currently under development.
