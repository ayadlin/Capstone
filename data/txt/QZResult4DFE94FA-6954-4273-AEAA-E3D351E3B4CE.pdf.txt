BACKGROUND: The immunotherapy (IT) agents ipilimumab and interleukin-2 as well as BRAF inhibitors (BRAFi) vemurafenib and dabrafenib, with or without trametinib (MEK inhibitors), are all FDA-approved treatments for BRAF metastatic melanoma, but there are few
studies to guide optimal sequencing. This retrospective analysis describes the outcomes of patients treated with either BRAFi before IT or
IT before BRAFi. METHODS: A cohort of patients treated with BRAFi alone or with MEK inhibitor was retrospectively identified.
Response rate (RR), overall survival (OS), and progression-free survival (PFS) were evaluated for the entire cohort, subdivided by BRAFi
prior to or after IT. RESULTS: RR and median PFS and OS calculated from commencement of BRAFi following IT (N 5 32) were 57%, 6.7
months (95% confidence interval [CI] 5 4.3-9.1 months), and 19.6 months (95% CI 5 10.0-undefined months), respectively; whereas for
BRAFi initially (N 5 242) were 66%, 5.6 months (95% CI 5 4.7-6.8 months), and 13.4 months (95% CI 5 10.1-17.0 months). Results were similar when controlled for prognostic variables. A total of 193 patients discontinued BRAFi, with OS of 2.9 months (range of 1.8-4.4 months)
from day of BRAFi discontinuation. Forty patients subsequently received IT with ipilimumab. Only half could complete 4 doses of ipilimumab; PFS with ipilimumab was 2.7 months (95% CI 5 1.8-3.1 months) and OS was 5.0 months (95% CI 5 3.0-8.8 months). CONCLUSIONS:
In this retrospective analysis, prior treatment with IT does not appear to negatively influence response to BRAFi. Outcomes for IT
with ipilimumab following BRAFi discontinuation are poor. Randomized controlled trials are needed to define if sequencing IT prior to

INTRODUCTION
Ipilimumab, a monoclonal antibody against cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4, and vemurafenib, a potent inhibitor of mutant
BRAF, have been shown to improve the overall survival (OS) of patients with metastatic melanoma in phase 3 randomized
controlled trials.1-3 Consequently, both drugs have been approved for the treatment of unresectable stage III and stage IV melanoma and have changed the standard of care for these patients. A second BRAF inhibitor (BRAFi), dabrafenib, and the MEK
inhibitor (MEKi) trametinib also improve response rates and survival compared with chemotherapy in patients with metastatic BRAF-mutant melanoma and more recently have received US regulatory approval in May 2013.4,5 Furthermore, the
dabrafenib/trametinib combination has improved efficacy over single-agent dabrafenib.6 In the context of this progress, a clinical dilemma has emerged regarding how best to sequence these agents in treating patients with BRAF-mutant melanoma.
There is little evidence to guide sequencing decisions, other than comparisons across studies and ad hoc analyses of
small subsets of patients in larger studies or compassionate access programs.7 The patterns and rates of response are

different when comparing immunotherapy (IT) with
BRAFi therapy. Only a small subgroup of those treated
with IT will benefit, but those who do may experience prolonged remissions. This concept was first described with
the use of interleukin-2 (IL-2), a therapy associated with a
16% to 22% response rate and a durable (> 2 years) remission rate that approaches 10%.8 In small series of patients,
adoptive T-cell transfer, which is a more intensive IT, has
resulted in complete remissions in up to 40% of cases, even
when other ITs have failed.9 This approach remains investigational and is available at a limited number of centers.
Treatment with ipilimumab is associated with response
rates of 15% and 11% in first-line and second-line phase 3
studies and 2-year OS of 28.5% and 23.5%, respectively.1,2
Recent reports suggest that treatment with inhibitors of the
second identified immune checkpoint, programmed death
1 (PD1):PD ligand 1 (PDL1), also are associated with clinical benefit that likely exceeds that of high-dose IL-2 or ipilimumab. These agents remain under investigation;
however, the response rates, approaching 30% to 50% or
more, and durability of these responses suggest that these
agents will likely be approved by the US Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) by the end of 2014.10-13
Compared with IT, BRAFi therapy is associated
with more frequent and earlier responses (single-agent
rate 50%, BRAFi and MEKi combination rate 75%
relative to 10% to 20% response rates for IL-2 or ipilimumab).1-7 Treatment with a BRAFi is associated with
symptomatic relief within days of commencing treatment,
whereas IT and ipilimumab, in particular, may take several weeks or months before responses and symptom
reduction are realized.14,15 Although BRAF inhibitors
produce a disease control rate > 90%, the median
progression-free survival (PFS) is only 6 months.3,4 However, some patients in the initial phase 1 study with
vemurafenib have durable responses with a reported 2year survival of 36%, and a subset of these surviving
patients remain on drug without progression.10
There are few published data regarding outcomes of
the sequence of BRAFi therapy followed by or prior to IT,
with ipilimumab or other agents. In order to determine if
the sequence of treatment with a BRAFi and IT affects
patient outcomes, we retrospectively examined the
response rate and PFS in patients with BRAF-mutant
metastatic melanoma treated sequentially with BRAFi,
with or without IT. Two cohorts of patients were examined from 5 international melanoma centers; those who
received IT prior to a BRAFi, and those who received a
BRAFi first. Subsequently, a subset of patients who
received BRAFi and then ipilimumab were analyzed.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Population

A cohort was retrospectively identified of 274 patients
with BRAF-mutant metastatic melanoma, who were consecutively enrolled in clinical trials of BRAF inhibitors or
treated with standard-of-care vemurafenib at the DanaFarber Harvard Cancer Center (Beth Israel Deaconess
Medical Center, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center) in the United
States; Melanoma Institute of Australia; or Westmead
Hospital, Sydney, Australia, between 2009 and 2012.
Inclusion required documentation of BRAF V600 mutation, measurable disease, and treatment with dabrafenib,
vemurafenib, or the combination of dabrafenib and trametinib. Patients who had received prior treatment with
other BRAF inhibitors were excluded. Other lines of therapy were allowed before or after the BRAFi treatment,
including surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy.
Treatment

All patients received a BRAFi—vemurafenib, dabrafenib,
or dabrafenib/trametinib—either as per clinical trial or
compassionate use protocol or via commercial use of
vemurafenib. Patients may have received one or more of
the following treatments that were considered immunotherapies: commercial high-dose IL-2, ipilimumab (clinical trial, compassionate use, or commercial), or clinical
trials of PD-1 antibodies (nivolumab, MK-3475, and
CT-011), anti-PDL1 antibody (MPDL-3280A), or adoptive T-cell therapy. A subset of patients received IT as
first-line therapy before initiating BRAFi, termed “IT initially,” and a different subset of patients received IT following discontinuation of BRAFi, termed “post-BRAFi.”
Continuation with BRAFi after progression was allowed
on several of the clinical trial protocols, and reinstitution
of vemurafenib following removal from trial was feasible
after FDA approval.
Statistical Analysis

Outcomes to BRAFi therapy were analyzed by using a retrospective subset analysis. Fisher’s exact test calculated P
values to compare characteristics of the subsets treated
with immunotherapy in the first line prior to BRAFi, “IT
initially” versus a larger subset which had not received
prior immunotherapy, “BRAFi initially.” Outcome endpoints included objective response rate (RR) as defined by
Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)
1.0, PFS, and OS. BRAFi PFS or OS were defined from
the start of BRAFi until progression as defined by
RECIST, death, or last documented contact. The KaplanCancer

analysis. The choice of BRAFi was also statistically different between the 2 groups, because BRAF inhibitors were
not commercially available in Australia and were accessed
only via clinical trials or compassionate access programs,
eg, 62% patients received BRAFi on a clinical trial, 27%
on compassionate access, and 11% commercially. In addition, ipilimumab remains unfunded in Australia and was
available via a compassionate program up until April
2012, thus restricting treatment options once a patient
had progressed on BRAFi to compassionate access in Australia. In the United States, ipilimumab was available
through compassionate access until 2011 when it was
FDA-approved and became commercially available.

Patient Characteristics

Response to BRAFi

A total of 274 patients received BRAFi; 117 received
vemurafenib, 99 received dabrafenib, and 58 received
dabrafenib/trametinib. The total cohort was subdivided
into 32 patients who received immunotherapy in the firstline “IT initially” (15 patients received high-dose IL-2
alone, 10 patients received ipilimumab alone, 1 patient
received PD-1 antibody alone, and 6 patients received IL2 followed by monoclonal antibody) versus 242 patients
who received BRAFi as first-line therapy without prior IT
“BRAFi initially.” Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was statistically different between the 2 groups (Table 1) and
therefore is a significant variable in the multivariate

In univariate analysis comparing the groups, “IT initially”
(n 5 32) versus “BRAFi initially” (n 5 242), response to
BRAFi was not inferior when administered after IT. As
noted in Table 2, the relative risk was 57% versus 66% for
the groups “IT initially” versus “BRAFi initially,” with a
non–statistically significant Fisher’s exact P value of .31.
PFS was 6.7 months (95% CI 5 4.3-9.1 months) versus
5.6 months (95 % CI 5 4.7-6.8 months) for the groups
“IT initially” versus “BRAFi initially,” with a non–statistically significant log-rank P value of .43 (Fig. 1B). OS was
19.6 months (95% CI 5 10.0-undefined months) versus

statistically significant log-rank P value of .40 (Fig. 1B).
Because LDH and choice of BRAFi differed between
populations, a Cox proportional hazards model was used
to assess the contribution of initial IT (Table 3). The variables, in addition to prior treatment with IT, included
LDH within normal limits or elevated, performance status, stage, previously treated stable brain metastatic disease, treatment with vemurafenib versus dabrafenib versus
dabrafenib/trametinib. Prior IT was associated with a
nonsignificant improvement in PFS and OS (P values of
.39 and .86 for PFS and OS, respectively). Choice of
BRAFi, prior brain metastasis, and AJCC stage IV M1a
versus M1b versus M1c disease were likewise not

and OS.

Following discontinuation of BRAFi (n 5 193), median time to death was 3.0 months (95% CI 5 2.1-4.8

Outcomes of patients who received ipilimumab following
BRAFi are summarized in Table 4. Of the 193 patients
who discontinued BRAFi, a subset of 40 patients were
subsequently treated with ipilimumab (33 patients with
second-line, 7 patients with third-line). Because not all
193 patients were restaged, it is difficult to statistically
compare this subset of 40 patients relative to the larger
cohort. Of the 27 patients with recorded pretreatment
LDH and recorded performance status, 16 (59%) had an
elevated LDH and 10 (36%) had a performance status of
2 or greater. No responses to post-BRAFi ipilimumab
were seen; 34 (94%) patients had progressive disease, and
2 had stable disease (6%). The full 4-dose treatment of
ipilimumab was received by only 50% of patients due to
clinical deterioration or toxicity. Twenty-four of the 40
patients are deceased, and the median PFS and OS for
post-BRAFi ipilimumab therapy was 2.7 months (95%
CI 5 1.8-3.1 months) and 5.0 months (95% CI 5 3.08.8 months), respectively (Fig. 2). Confounding is significant; for example, OS for post-BRAFi ipilimumab was
greater than a year for 3 patients: 1 had a response to subsequent reinitiation of vemurafenib with response, 1 had a
response to BRAFi/MEKi, and 1 had stable disease with
reinitiation of vemurafenib.

patients with BRAF-mutation–positive metastatic melanoma. The results of this multicentered case series have
important clinical ramifications. First, using a multivariate model, there was no statistical difference in OS or PFS
based on whether patients first received a BRAFi or IT.
Second, the response rate of BRAFi therapy was similar in
patients who did or did not receive prior IT. Third, the
median OS after BRAFi discontinuation was very short.
Fourth, ipilimumab therapy following BRAF inhibitors
was associated with no tumor responses and poor survival.
Patients treated with ipilimumab after a BRAFi had
poorer outcomes than the results reported for ipilimumab
in both first- and second-line settings. It is not clear if this
result is because these patients had largely discontinued
BRAFi due to progression, and in the setting of rapid clinical deterioration and poor performance status have insufficient lifespan to benefit from ipilimumab, which
typically requires weeks or months to show response, or
whether there is a biological explanation such as an intrinsic resistance to IT after a BRAFi. One potential biological
explanation of reduced IT benefit after BRAFi therapy is
related to tumor melanocytic antigen expression and Tcell infiltration. Namely, BRAFi therapy has been shown
to be associated with an increase in tumor melanocytic
antigen expression and tumor CD-8 T-cell infiltration;
whereas time-of-progression biopsies have demonstrated
that tumor melanocytic expression and T-cell infiltration
was no longer evident.16,17 It is critical that these concepts
be tested further in well-controlled randomized clinical
trials, which investigate optimal sequencing and timing of
1700

therapies and ideally that include correlative analyses that
help to identify why patients may or may not respond to
therapies.
In the absence of randomized trials comparing the
order of therapies, this retrospective analysis provides
some data from which to base decisions regarding
sequencing of therapies. The results of this study support
the use of IT prior to BRAFi therapy in select patients,
because there is no apparent detriment to the effectiveness
of either agent when their use is sequenced in this manner,
although the results do not refute that front-line BRAF inhibitor therapy is a reasonable alternative. The results also
show that survival is very poor for those with BRAFmutant melanoma who are refractory to BRAF inhibitors.
Treatment after BRAFi failure has become the greatest
unmet need in this patient population.
This study is limited because it is retrospective and
thus susceptible to recall bias and selection bias. Although
the inclusion of every patient treated with a BRAFi at the
5 institutions from the prespecified time interval limits
this bias, this cohort is unlikely to be representative of all
patients with BRAF-mutant metastatic melanoma. Access
to vemurafenib, dabrafenib, and ipilimumab via clinical
trial, compassionate use, or commercial use was influenced by insurance and federal regulations, which differed
between the multiple institutions over the interval 2009
to 2012, possibly contributing to bias in selection of therapy. Specifically, those who did not receive a BRAFi for
whatever reason (lack of access prior to regulatory approval, durable response to surgery or immunotherapy,

comorbidities, and so forth) are not included in this analysis. In addition, initial selection for first-line therapy was
based on several factors including rate of disease progression, performance status, age, other comorbidities, presence of brain metastases, patient preference, clinical trial
availability, and “fitness” for IT as judged by the treating
physicians. Because many of these potential confounders
are difficult to objectively extract from the medical record,
they cannot be controlled in the multivariate analysis.
These factors likely resulted in patients with a poorer
prognosis, eg, rapidly progressive disease or brain metastases, receiving first-line BRAFi therapy.18 Only a welldesigned randomized controlled trial to examine optimal
sequencing can account for these potential confounders.
Despite these limitations, the data suggest that BRAF
inhibitors are as effective after IT as they are prior to IT, and
that IT should be considered first-line if a patient with
BRAF-mutant metastatic melanoma is an “immunotherapy
candidate.” Because recent reports suggest that inhibitors of
the second identified immune checkpoint, PD1, are associated with as high or higher response rates, the rationale to
treat with upfront IT may have increased support, although
it is important to note that these agents may also be associated with more rapid responses and may be associated with
a higher rate of clinical benefit at the time of BRAF therapy
resistance.10-13 The optimal sequence strategy for patients
with BRAF-mutant, metastatic melanoma is the subject of
an industry-sponsored study exploring the effect of sequencing vemurafenib prior to ipilimumab (ClinicalTrials.gov
identifier NCT01673854), as well as a US Cooperative
Group trial (4613) that is comparing the sequence of the
combination of dabrafenib and trametinib (DT) followed
by the combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab (NI) versus NI followed by DT. In addition, multiple studies are
investigating various combinations of BRAF inhibitors with
IT with the aim of improving complete response rate and
median survival (NCT01400451, NCT01656642, and
NCT01767454). However, until these sequencing and
combination studies are complete, melanoma treatment
providers will continue to need to make treatment decisions
regarding the administration sequence of BRAFi and IT.
