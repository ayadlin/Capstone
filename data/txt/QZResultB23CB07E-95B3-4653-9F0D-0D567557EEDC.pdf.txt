Abstract
Autophagy attenuates the efﬁcacy of conventional chemotherapy but its effects on immunotherapy have been
little studied. Here, we report that chemotherapy renders tumor cells more susceptible to lysis by CTL in vivo.
Moreover, bystander tumor cells that did not express antigen were killed by CTL. This effect was mediated by
transient but dramatic upregulation of the mannose-6-phosphate receptor (MPR) on the tumor cell surface.
Antitumor effects of combined treatment related to the kinetics of MPR upregulation and abrogation of this event
abolished the combined effect of immunotherapy and chemotherapy. MPR accumulation on the tumor cell
surface during chemotherapy was observed in different mouse tumor models and in patients with multiple
myeloma. Notably, this effect was the result of redistribution of the receptor caused by chemotherapy-inducible
autophagy. Together, our ﬁndings reveal one molecular mechanism through which the antitumor effects of
conventional cancer chemotherapy and immunotherapy are realized. Cancer Res; 72(21); 5483–93. 2012 AACR.

Introduction
Therapeutic cancer vaccines and adoptive T-cell transfer are
attractive options for the treatment of different types of cancer.
In recent years, it has become apparent that cancer immune
therapy may provide only limited clinical beneﬁts and that its
combination with targeted or cytotoxic chemotherapeutic
treatment will be necessary to achieve substantial clinical
beneﬁt. However, the use of conventional cancer chemotherapy in combination with immunotherapy was previously not
deemed appropriate because of potent immunosuppressive
effects usually associated with chemotherapy. This paradigm
was challenged in recent years by the serendipitous observations made in a number of phase I/II clinical trials in which
high rates of objective clinical responses were observed when
cancer vaccines were combined with chemotherapy (1–5).
These observations were made using various cancer vaccines
and different chemotherapeutic regimens in patients with
diverse types of cancer (6). The mechanisms of the potential
beneﬁcial effect of combined immunochemotherapy remain
unknown.

In animal tumor models, it has been shown that conventional chemotherapy and radiation therapy can induce
immune responses against antigens generated in dying tumor
cells (7, 8). Single injections of chemotherapeutic drugs may
induce an antitumor immune response by directly causing
immunogenic cell death (9). When used in noncytotoxic doses,
drugs such as paclitaxel, doxorubicin, mitomycin C, and methotrexate increased antigen presentation by antigen presenting
cells (10). Dendritic cells (DC), treated with vinblastine, underwent maturation and exhibited better ability to induce CD8
T-cell responses compared with untreated DCs (11). Chemotherapy has also been shown to render cancer cells more
susceptible to killing by CTLs. 5-ﬂuorouracil, CPT-11, and
cisplatin were all shown to increase the sensitivity of the
SW480 colon cancer cell line to killing by T cells (12). Cytotoxic
drugs can modulate systemic immune suppression or expand
antigen-speciﬁc T-cells via cytoreduction (reviewed in ref. 13).
However, the paradox is that the chemotherapeutic agents
used in those studies are known to suppress immunity in
cancer patients during treatment, which includes multiple
repeated doses of drugs (14). There is ample evidence that
chemotherapeutic agents can ablate T-cell function and blunt
antitumor immune responses (15). Previous studies indicated
that conventional doses of chemotherapy did not support
the development and maintenance of antitumor immune
responses (16). Even in patients who beneﬁted from combined
treatment, chemotherapy inhibited antigen-speciﬁc T cells
generated by previously administered cancer vaccines (2).
Moreover, combination of chemotherapy with high-dose cytokines has failed to improve survival of patients with metastatic
melanoma (17).
These observations suggested that chemotherapy can
potentiate immunity if used in either single dose or in low
noncytotoxic doses. However, the critical question is: Can

immunotherapy be used in combination with conventional
chemotherapy in patients with advanced stage cancer?
We recently showed that chemotherapy makes tumor cells
permeable to granzyme B (GrzB) released by activated CTLs in
a perforin independent manner (18). We suggested that this
effect in vitro could be mediated via upregulation of the cationindependent mannose-6-phosphate (MPR) receptor on the
surface of tumor cells. MPR (also termed insulin-like growth
factor 2 receptor) is a multifunctional protein with high-afﬁnity
binding to insulin-like growth factor 2. Within the cell, MPRs
are found in the trans-Golgi network (TGN), endosomes, and
are also present within the plasma membrane. On the membrane, these receptors bind to their ligands and the whole
complex is packaged in transport intermediates consisting of
clathrin-coated vesicles and the AP-1 assembly complex. Clathrin-coated vesicles mediate the sorting of MPRs from TGN
for transportation to endosomal compartments. Within early
endosomes, ligand dissociates from the receptor because of the
low pH (19). The receptors are recycled back to TGN by the
complex containing Golgi-localized, g-ear containing ADPribosylation factor binding proteins (20). MPR function is
associated with endocytosis and degradation (21). MPR was
previously implicated in granzyme B delivery to cells, bypassing perforin (22). Although under normal conditions, MPR play
a minor role in CTL-mediated killing (23–25), this receptor is
considered to be an important factor that, together with
perforin, mediates granzyme B entry into the cell (24, 26).
In this study, we investigated the role of MPR during combined chemotherapy and immune therapy of cancer in vivo.

were collected before and immediately after 3 days of highdose chemotherapy. Cell suspensions from bone marrow
aspirates were cytospun on slides and kept frozen in liquid
nitrogen. Paired samples from 10 patients treated under this
protocol were available for the analysis in our study.
Immunohistochemistry for MPR
Protocol is provided in Supplemental Materials.
Transfection of cell lines with MPR shRNA, ATG5siRNA,
or ATG5shRNA vector
B16F10 and B16F10 kb cell lines were stably transfected
with either a control plasmid short hairpin RNA (shRNA) or
MPR or Atg5 shRNA vector incorporating the puromycin
resistance gene for selection (Mission, Sigma-Aldrich) using
Geneporter 2 kit (Genlantis). B16F10 cells were transfected
with ATG5siRNA using the Nucleofector Kit C (Lonza; Program
X-05 on Amaxa) and 300 nmol/L of atg5 siRNAs or with 300
nmol/L of scrambled siRNA. The cells were resuspended in
Dulbecco's Modiﬁed Eagle's Media medium and rested for 48
hours before treatment with paclitaxel.
Detection of MPR and granzyme B in cell lines
Cell lines were treated with 12.5 nmol/L paclitaxel for 16
hours and labeled for MPR and granzyme B as described earlier
(18). A portion of the cells was ﬁxed with 2% paraformaldehye
for 20 minutes at room temperature before staining. Dead cells
were discriminated from the live population by either 40 , 6diamidino-2-phenylindole stain or Live/Dead Fixable Dead cell
stain kit (Invitrogen).

Mice and tumor models
Animal protocols were approved by the University of South
Florida Animal Care and Use Committee. Female C57BL/6J
(B6, H-2b), BALB/c (H-2d), and Pmel mice were purchased from
The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME) or Charles River
Laboratories (Wilmington, MA). Murine lymphoblastoma cell
line, EL4 and B16-F10 melanoma, mammary carcinoma 4T1
lines were purchased from American Type Culture Collection
(ATCC) after 2009. B16-F10Kb cells were isolated as an escape
mutant from vaccinated mice (27). Small cell lung cancer cell
line 86M1 and human multiple myeloma cell lines H929, U266,
and 8226 were purchased from ATCC after 2008. The cells were
maintained in RPMI 1640 media containing 10% FBS. B16-F10luc-G5 mouse melanoma cell line that expresses the ﬁreﬂy
luciferase was obtained from Xenogen and maintained with
200 mg/mL Zeocin (Invitrogen). Tumor cells were treated with
12.5 nmol/L paclitaxel, 25 ng/mL doxorubicin, and 25 ng/mL
cisplatin for 18 hours before being used as targets in various
assays.

Treatment protocol for B16F10 control shRNA/MPR
shRNA tumor models
C57BL/6 mice were inoculated with 0.5  106 tumor cells/
mouse on day 0. Spleen cells from Pmel mice were activated
with 0.1 mg/mL of gp-100 peptide in vitro for 72 hours and T
cells were puriﬁed using nylon wool. On day 11, mice were
injected intravenously with 5  106 of Pmel T cells. On day 14,
paclitaxel was administered intraperitoneally at a dose of 12.5
mg/kg.

Patients' samples
Patients with a histologically conﬁrmed diagnosis of multiple myeloma were enrolled during 2002–2006 to clinical
protocol MCC12733 approved by the University of South
Florida institutional review board. Patients were treated for
3 days with melphalan (50 mg/m2/d i.v.) and escalating doses of
topotecan (starting at 10 mg/m2/d i.v.). Bone marrow samples

cells were treated with 1 mmol/L 3 methyladenine (3MA) for 4
hours before treatment with doxorubicin overnight and then
stained as described above. The cells were imaged with a Leica
TCS SP5 laser scanning confocal microscope through a 63X/
1.40NA Plan Apochromat oil immersion objective lens (Leica
Microsystems). Diode lasers lines of 405 and 555 nm were
applied to excite the samples. An acousto-optical beam splitter
was used to collect peak emission photons sequentially to
minimize cross-talk between ﬂuorochromes. Protocol is provided in Supplementary Methods.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was conducted using a 2-tailed Student
t test and GraphPad Prism 5 software (GraphPad Software
Inc.), with signiﬁcance determined at P < 0.05. Analysis of
tumor growth curves was conducted, using a 2-way ANOVA
test with a Bonferroni posttest.

Results
The antitumor effect of combined
chemoimmunotherapy is linked to a transient induction
of MPR
We tested the effects of chemotherapy on the expression of
MPR in vivo using several mouse (B16F10 melanoma, 4T1
mammary carcinoma) and human (multiple myeloma 8226,
H929, and U266) tumor cell lines. Consistent with the results of
our previous study (18), different chemotherapeutic agents
such as paclitaxel, doxorubicin, and cisplatin caused substantial, and similar upregulation of MPR expression in vitro in all
tested mouse and human tumor cell lines (Fig. 1A).
To determine the effects of chemotherapy on the level of the
receptor in vivo, tumors were established in either syngenic
mice (C57BL/6 for B6F10, BALB/c for 4T1) or nonobese
diabetic/severe combined immunodeﬁcient (NOD/SCID) or
nude mice (human tumors). When tumors reached 1 cm in
diameter mice were treated with doses of appropriate chemotherapy (paclitaxel for B16F10 and 4T1 tumors; doxorubicin for
multiple myeloma tumors; cisplatin for lung carcinoma) that
resulted in a substantial inhibition of tumor progression within
7 to 10 days after administration (data not shown). In all tumor
models, signiﬁcant (P < 0.01) upregulation of MPR was
detected 48 hours after the injection of chemotherapeutic
drugs. It remained elevated for another 24 hours and then
returned to the pretreatment level within 5 days after injection
(Fig. 1B and C and Supplementary Fig. S1).
We then asked whether the kinetics of MPR upregulation was
relevant for the antitumor effects of combination therapy. Mice
with established B6F10 melanoma were treated with paclitaxel
alone, adoptive transfer of in vitro activated Pmel-1 CTLs that
recognize gp100-derived epitope on B16F10 cells, or with the
combination of these 2 therapies. Administration of either T
cells or paclitaxel alone substantially delayed tumor growth,
which however, resumed 1 week after the treatment (Fig. 1D).
When paclitaxel was combined with T-cell therapy, a signiﬁcant
(P < 0.05) potentiating effect was observed. However, this effect
was seen only if paclitaxel was administered 2 days after T cells.
When paclitaxel was injected 5 days before T-cell administration, no increased antitumor effect was observed (Fig. 1D). Thus

chemotherapy induced transient upregulation of MPR on
tumor cells, which was directly associated with antitumor effect
of combined chemoimmunotherapy.
The role of MPR in the antitumor effect of combination
chemoimmunotherapy
We generated a B16F10 tumor cell line with stable expression of MPR shRNA. In contrast to cells transfected with
control shRNA, cells transfected with MPR shRNA did not
upregulate MPR in response to paclitaxel treatment in vitro
(Fig. 2A) or in vivo (Fig. 2B). Paclitaxel did not increase
granzyme B penetration into cells expressing MPR shRNA (Fig.
2C). Treatment of mice bearing B16F10 tumors expressing
control shRNA with the combination of paclitaxel and Pmel-1
CTL showed antitumor activity that was signiﬁcantly (P < 0.05)
higher than each therapy alone. This effect was not seen in
mice bearing tumors expressing MPR shRNA (Fig. 2D).
We tested the direct role of MPR in chemotherapy-inducible
penetration of recombinant granzyme B to the tumor cells in
vitro. As expected, treatment of control shRNA B16F10 with
granzyme B during 6 hours did not result in induction of
apoptosis. However, pretreatment of these cells with paclitaxel
made them sensitive to the subsequent treatment with granzyme B. This effect was completely abrogated in MPR shRNA
B16F10 cells (Fig. 2E).
To test this hypothesis in vivo we used wild-type (H2Kb)
B16F10 cells expressing luciferase (B16-Luc) and B16F10
H2Kb cells. B16-H2Kb cells were transfected with control
or MPR shRNA. As effector cells, we used CTLs that recognize a
Trp2180-188-derived peptide epitope expressed on B16F10 cells.
As this epitope is recognized in the context of H2Kb, these CTLs
do not kill B16-H2Kb cells (data not shown). In this experimental system, we measured the tumor size of both B16-Luc
and B16-H2Kb tumors with calipers and independently monitored the growth of B16-Luc tumor using in vivo imaging.
First, we used control shRNA B16-H2Kb cells. B16-Luc and
B16-H2Kb cells showed similar growth rates after subcutaneous (s.c.) injection into C57BL/6 mice (data not shown). To test
the effect of therapy, B16-Luc and B16-H2Kb tumors were
established in the opposite ﬂanks of the same mouse. When
tumors became palpable, mice were split into 4 groups and
treated with either paclitaxel or CTLs alone, no treatment or
with the combination. Paclitaxel, at the selected dose, had a
modest antitumor effect against both tumors, whereas Trp2
CTLs had antitumor effects only against wild-type B16-Luc cells
(Fig. 3A) but not against B16-H2Kb cells (Fig. 3B). Signiﬁcant
(P < 0.05) potentiation of the antitumor effects of combined
paclitaxel and CTLs was observed only in the ﬂank with B16-Luc
tumor (Fig. 3A) but not with B16-H2Kb tumors (Fig. 3B).
In the other sets of experiments, B16-Luc and B16-H2Kb
cells were mixed together at a 1:1 ratio and injected s.c. into
mice. Mice with established tumors were then treated with
paclitaxel and Trp2 CTLs either separately or in combination.
Combining paclitaxel and CTLs resulted in a signiﬁcantly (P <
0.05) greater antitumor effect than each of them separately.
This was seen by monitoring tumor size with calipers (Fig. 3C)
and by in vivo imaging (Fig. 3D and Supplementary Fig. S2).
Similar experiments were conducted by mixing B16-Luc and

bystander killing of tumor cells without the need for antigen
recognition and that this effect was mediated by MPR.
Mechanism of MPR upregulation by chemotherapy
We then asked how chemotherapy could regulate MPR on
tumor cells. We tested the possible regulation of MPR synthesis
or degradation by chemotherapy agents. We did not observe
the effect of paclitaxel, cisplatin, or doxorubicin on total
amount of MPR protein by using Western blot (Fig. 4A) or
ﬂow cytometry after ﬁxation and permeabilization of the cells
(Supplementary Fig. S3). No effect of chemotherapy drugs on
Mpr expression was found (Fig. 4B).
We asked whether MPR accumulation is limited to the
cell membrane. In 3 different tumor cell lines treated with
paclitaxel or doxorubicin, chemotherapy induced substantial accumulation of MPR only in a membrane fraction (Fig.
4C). To verify these ﬁndings we evaluated MPR expression in
human multiple myeloma U266 cells treated with doxorubicin using confocal microscopy. Chemotherapy caused
redistribution of MPR from a primarily cytoplasmic to a

Similar results were obtained with mouse B16F10 cells
treated with paclitaxel (Supplementary Fig. S4).
To determine whether similar effects could be observed in
cancer patients, we used archived bone marrow samples
obtained from patients with multiple myeloma treated on
phase I trial of high-dose melphalan and topotecan followed
by peripheral blood stem cell rescue. Bone marrow cells were
collected from these patients before and after 3 days of highdose chemotherapy. The type of immunoglobulin secreted by
multiple myeloma for each patient has been determined;
therefore, we could use appropriate kappa or lambda chainspeciﬁc antibodies to detect multiple myeloma cells. In addition, cells were stained with MPR-speciﬁc antibody. We
assessed the proportion of multiple myeloma cells with predominantly membrane localization of MPR (Fig. 5A). Before
treatment, only 20% of the multiple myeloma cells had such a
characteristic, whereas after 3 days of high-dose chemotherapy
this proportion increased to more than 50% of all multiple
myeloma cells (P ¼ 0.02; Fig. 5B).

(TAX) and U266 with doxorubicin (DOX). The amount of total protein was evaluated by Western blotting (A) and mpr mRNA by qRT-PCR (B). C, membrane and
cytoplasmic fractions of tumor cells treated with paclitaxel or doxorubicin were isolated and MPR was detected by Western blotting. D, U266 were treated
overnight with doxorubicin, ﬁxed and stained with MPR speciﬁc antibody, and analyzed by confocal microscopy. Bar, 25 mm. Unt, untreated cells.

Autophagy as a mechanism of MPR accumulation on the
cell membrane
How can chemotherapy induce accumulation of MPR on the
cell surface? Autophagy is a common effect of chemotherapy
on tumor or endothelial cells (28–31). It is a relatively rapid
process and often associated with tumor cell survival from
chemotherapy. The mechanism of accumulation of autophagosomes in tumor cells depends on type of chemotherapy used.
We tested the possible role of autophagy in MPR upregulation.
As expected, treatment of tumor cells with paclitaxel, cisplatin,
or doxorubicin caused rapid induction of autophagy as determined by the appearance of autophagy-speciﬁc LC3 punctae in
treated cells (Fig. 6A). For pharmacologic inhibition of autophagy we used 3MA, established speciﬁc inhibitor of autophagy.
3MA abrogated upregulation of MPR on the surface of U266
multiple myeloma cells treated with doxorubicin (Fig. 6B) or
B16F10 cells treated with paclitaxel (Fig. 6C). 3MA also blocked
the doxorubicin-inducible redistribution of MPR to the cell
membrane (Fig. 6D). The cytotoxic activity of Pmel-1 CTLs
against B16F10 target cells treated with or without chemotherapy was tested in a standard chromium release assay.
Pretreatment of tumor cells with paclitaxel dramatically
increased Pmel-1 mediated killing of target cells. In contrast,
this effect was completely abrogated in the presence of 3MA
(Fig. 6E).
To further evaluate the role of autophagy in MPR upregulation, we downregulated expression of atg5, the gene
critically important for induction of autophagosomes, using
siRNA with 2 different siRNA (data not shown). Transfection
of B16F10 cells with atg5 siRNA completely abrogated the

www.aacrjournals.org

paclitaxel-inducible increase in MPR presence on the cell
surface (Fig. 7A). Transfection of atg5siRNA to U266 multiple
myeloma cells abrogated doxorubicin inducible upregulation of MPR (Fig. 7B). It also completely abrogated granzyme
B penetration to these cells (Fig. 7C). To verify these ﬁndings
independently, we established melanoma B16F10 cell line
with stable expression of atg5 shRNA. These cells have
substantially lower level of Atg5 than B16F10 cells transfected with control shRNA (Fig. 7D). Downregulation of Atg5
abrogated paclitaxel-inducible upregulation of MPR on the
surface of the tumor cells (Fig. 7E) and increased killing of
tumor cells by speciﬁc CTLs (Fig. 7F).
To assess a direct role of autophagy on regulation of MPR
expression on the cell surface we used rapamycin, a known
inducer of autophagy (32). Autophagy (determined by LC3
punctae) was detected in U266 multiple myeloma (Fig. 7G) and
B16F10 (Fig. 7H) cells treated with rapamycin at concentration
of 100 nmol/L. At this and higher doses, rapamycin caused a
substantial increase in MPR levels on the tumor cell surface
(Fig. 7I and J).

Discussion
In this study, we tried to determine why the combination of
chemotherapy with adoptive T-cell transfer resulted in an
enhanced antitumor effect. This study was based on previous
serendipitous ﬁndings obtained in a number of clinical trials
demonstrating an unusually high rate of objective clinical
responses observed in patients treated with conventional
chemotherapy after failing cancer vaccines (6). These effects
were obtained with different chemotherapeutic drugs and

different types of cancer vaccines suggesting that there was
some common mechanism involved. Moreover, in all those
cases, conventional doses of chemotherapy were used, which
are known to inhibit immune responses. Therefore, although
the ability of chemotherapy to induce immunogeneic tumor
cell death has been described (33, 34), this mechanism was
unlikely involved in this case. Recently, we showed in experiments in vitro a possible role of MPR in this process. Whether
this mechanism is indeed operational in vivo remained unclear.
More importantly, the role of this process in mediating the
antitumor effect of combination therapy as well as the mechanism of MPR upregulation on tumor cells was unknown. To
address these questions, we used different tumor models and
chemotherapeutic drugs with different mechanism of action.
The doses of the drugs were selected to impact on tumor
progression. Most of the experiments with combined treatment were conducted with paclitaxel. Previous studies have
shown that at selected doses, repeated injections of paclitaxel
are immune suppressive (35).
As immune therapy, we used the adoptive transfer of
antigen-speciﬁc T cells, a promising new method of treatment that has shown antitumor effects in mice and patients
(36–38). We found that chemotherapy caused dramatic,
albeit only transient upregulation of MPR on tumor cells
in vivo. This effect was seen in every tumor model tested and
with all drugs used. Importantly, the effect of combined
treatment was seen only when chemotherapy was given
within a window of time during which increased level of
MPR was observed on tumor cells. After the MPR level was

5490

Cancer Res; 72(21) November 1, 2012

normalized, addition of adoptive T-cell transfer did not
induce any further therapeutic beneﬁt. This result suggested
that the effect of combination therapy depended on upregulation of MPR. To test this hypothesis directly, we inhibited MPR expression on tumor cells using shRNA and found
that the antitumor effect of combination chemoimmunotherapy was abrogated in mice bearing MPR-deﬁcient
tumor cells.
We suggested that if MPR did indeed mediate the antitumor
effect of CTLs in combination with chemotherapy, then tumor
cells not expressing speciﬁc antigens, and thus not recognized
by CTLs would not be sensitive to the effect of combination
therapy. Our data have shown that no antitumor effect of T-cell
transfer was seen in mice bearing tumors lacking one of MHC
class I allele (H2Kb), which binds the speciﬁc peptide (Trp2180188) that is recognized by CTLs. Not surprisingly, in that tumor,
combination therapy did not provide any additional beneﬁt
over the effect of chemotherapy alone. However, when wildtype and H2Kb tumor cells were mixed together the effect of
combined chemoimmunotherapy was prominent. Apparently,
activated CTLs were able to kill not only wild-type tumor cells
that expressed speciﬁc antigen but also those that could not be
recognized by CTLs (H2Kb cells). This effect was abrogated
when MPR deﬁcient H2Kb tumor cells were mixed with
wild-type tumor cells. These data strongly support the concept
that in combination with chemotherapy, activated CTLs can
release granzyme B, which is able to bind MPR on neighboring
tumor cells regardless of whether those cells express MHC
class I or not.

drugs. Staining with LC3 speciﬁc antibody (red). Bar, 25 mm. B–D, MPR upregulation in B16F10 cell induced by paclitaxel (TAX; B) or in U266 cells induced by
doxorubicin (DOX; C and D) was abrogated by inhibitor of autophagy 3MA. Staining of cells was evaluated by ﬂow cytometry (B and C) and by confocal
microscopy (D). A–D, each experiment was conducted at least 3 times. E, autophagy inhibitor 3MA abrogated combined cytotoxic effect of paclitaxel (12.5 ng/
51
mL, overnight treatment) and CTLs (activated Pmel T cells) against B16F10 tumor cells. Standard Cr-release assay was conducted in duplicates. Results of 2
experiments are shown (mean  SD). Unt, untreated cells.

The other main question we addressed in this study was
how chemotherapy can upregulate MPR expression on the
surface of tumor cells. Our data indicate that chemotherapy
did not induce MPR synthesis and did not inhibit its
degradation. Instead, we observed redistribution of MPR
within the cells. Normally more than 90% of total MPR is
localized inside the cells in different compartments (endosomes and TGN; ref. 39). After chemotherapy, large amount
of MPR was localized on the cell membrane. This might
account for stronger immunohistochemistry staining of
tumor tissues after treatment with chemotherapy (MPR
localized on cell surface is more accessible for antibodies
and thus is better stained than MPR localized in intracellular
compartments) and could explain the increased uptake of
granzyme B by tumor cells after interaction with CTLs
observed in our previous study (18).
What could cause redistribution of the MPR in the cell? In
recent years, increasing evidence has accumulated about the
importance of autophagy in cancer treatment (40–42). Autophagy is a reversible process that can contribute both to tumor
cell death and survival. This catabolic pathway is initiated by
the formation of a phagophore around cytoplasmic organelles
and/or some portion of the cytosol. The enclosed material is
sequestered in a vacuole lined by 2 membranes called the
autophagosome. Autophagosomes then undergo fusion with
either endosomes or lysosomes. The mechanism of autophagosome formation depends on the type of chemotherapeutic
drug. In our study, paclitaxel, doxorubicin, and cisplatin caused
rapid induction of autophagy in tumor cells, which was asso-

www.aacrjournals.org

ciated with upregulation of MPR. Blockade of autophagy with
either its inhibitor 3MA or by downregulating atg5 resulted in
abrogation of chemotherapy-induced upregulation of MPR on
the tumor cell surface. How exactly this may happen is not
entirely clear. We propose that MPR is redirected to autophagosomes either as part of clathrin-coated vesicles, or as part of
fusion of autophagosomes with endosomes. In both cases, low
pH in autophagosomes results in release of the MPR cargo
followed by shuttle of the receptor to the surface. The detailed
mechanism of this effect needs to be clariﬁed.
Recently Michaud and colleagues showed that autophagy
was dispensable for chemotherapy-induced cell death but
required for its immunogenicity. In response to chemotherapy,
autophagy-competent, but not autophagy-deﬁcient cancers
attracted dendritic cells and T lymphocytes into the tumor
bed. This effect was mediated via ATP (43). The issue of the
relationship between autophagy and tumor immunity requires
further elucidation as there is evidence that autophagy can
limit immmune-mediated cytotoxicity (44) and that autophagy-deﬁcient tumors may be rare (45).
Our study presents a novel concept relating to the interaction between CTLs and tumor cells undergoing autophagy that
can be clinically exploited not only in the setting of chemotherapy but also radiation therapy, as well as other treatments
that cause autophagy of tumor cells. Our data show that
combining chemotherapy and immunotherapy as a front line
therapy in patients with advanced cancer has a strong rationale. However, it needs to be carefully timed and may be
monitored using MPR expression.
