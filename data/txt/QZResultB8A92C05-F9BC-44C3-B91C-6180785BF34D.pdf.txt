BACKGROUND. The objective of this study was to assess the value of combinedmodality therapy in elderly patients by comparing the differences in outcome
between patients who received radiotherapy (RT) alone and patients who
received RT plus chemotherapy for stage III nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

METHODS. The North Central Cancer Treatment Group performed 2 recent Phase
III trials for stage III NSCLC. The first trial, NCCTG 90-24-51, included 3 arms:
once-daily RT (QDRT) alone, twice-daily RT (BIDRT) alone, and concurrent
chemotherapy plus BIDRT. The second trial, NCCTG 94-24-52, included 2 arms
and compared concurrent chemotherapy with either QDRT or BIDRT. The chemotherapy arms of both trials included etoposide and cisplatin administered concurrently with RT. Only the patients aged 65 years (elderly) who participated in
those trials were included in this analysis.

RESULTS. Of the 166 elderly patients who were included in this analysis, 37

therapy group (log-rank P 5 .05). Patients who received RT plus chemotherapy
experienced significantly greater severe toxicity (grade 3) compared with
patients who received RT alone (89.9% vs 32.4%; P < 0.01).

CONCLUSIONS. Elderly patients who participated in these trials appeared to gain
a survival advantage from RT and chemotherapy compared with RT alone. As is
the case with younger patients, this benefit came at the cost of additional toxicity. Cancer 2007;110:363–8.  2007 American Cancer Society.

U

ntil recently, the standard treatment for locally advanced (stage
III) nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) was radiotherapy (RT)
alone. Conventional RT (60 grays [Gy] in 30 daily [QD] fractions)
alone resulted in a median survival of 10 months and a 5-year survival rate of 5%.1,2 Over the last 10 years, Phase III trials have demonstrated a significant survival advantage for patients who receive
chemotherapy in addition to RT.3–5 Also, the use of concurrent chemotherapy plus RT resulted in better survival than sequential therapy.6,7
The treatment strategy associated with the best survival is concurrent
RT and chemotherapy.
It is important to understand the effects of combined-modality
therapy in the elderly, because these patients often are diagnosed
with lung cancer.8 There are 2 main obstacles that limit enthusiasm
for aggressive treatment in the elderly: the concerns that therapy
results in excessive toxicity and poor outcomes. Some physicians

have suggested the use of single-agent palliative
chemotherapy, RT alone, or no treatment. Although
this may be appropriate for frail individuals, there are
many elderly patients who are reasonably fit and
desire the best chance for cure.
Previous retrospective studies have compared the
results of combined-modality therapy in younger
individuals with the results in elderly patients.9–11
There have been prospective trials performed that
included only elderly patients.12,13 In addition, investigators have compared various treatment regimens in
elderly patients.11 However, to our knowledge, there
are no published studies that have compared RT with
RT plus chemotherapy in an elderly cohort with stage
III NSCLC. To address this deficiency, the current
analysis was performed to assess the value of combined-modality therapy in elderly patients by comparing the differences in outcome of patients who
received RT alone versus patients who received RT
plus chemotherapy.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
The North Central Cancer Treatment Group (NCCTG)
performed 2 recent Phase III trials for stage III
NSCLC. Only the elderly patients (aged 65 years)
who participated in those trials were included in the
current analysis.
Patients who participated in these studies met the
following eligibility criteria: stage IIIA/B NSCLC, absolute neutrophil count >1500/mL, platelet count
>100,000/mL, serum creatinine <1.5 times the upper
limits of normal (ULN), forced expiratory volume in
1 second >1 L, weight loss 10% within the previous
3 months, and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group
(ECOG) performance status from 0 to 2. There was no
age restriction for participation in these studies.
In both trials, treatment took 6 weeks to complete and included identical chemotherapy in the
arms that included chemotherapy. Etoposide
(100 mg/m2) and cisplatin (30 mg/m2) (EP) were
administered on Days 1 through 3 and Days 28
through 30 during RT. The schema of these 2 trials
are shown in Figure 1. The first trial, NCCTG 90-2451, included 3 arms: standard once-daily RT (QDRT)
(60 Gy in 30 daily fractions) alone, twice-daily RT
(BIDRT) (30 Gy in 20 twice-daily fractions followed
by a 2-week break and 30 Gy in 20 twice-daily fractions) alone, or BIDRT plus concurrent EP chemotherapy (Fig. 1). This trial was closed prior to
completion, because multiple Phase III trials revealed
that chemotherapy plus RT provided superior survival to RT alone.3–5 The second trial, NCCTG 94-2452, included 2 arms and compared concurrent EP
chemotherapy with either QDRT (60 Gy in 30 frac-

tions) or BIDRT (60 Gy in 40 fractions) (Fig. 1). The
treatment details and results have been reported previously.10,14,15
A history and physical examination and complete blood cell count were obtained weekly during
therapy, and a serum creatinine level was checked
prior to the second cycle of chemotherapy. Dose
modifications because of treatment toxicity have
been described previously.14,15
These trials were reviewed and approved by each
participating institution’s Institutional Review Board.
The experimental nature of the study was explained
to and informed consent was obtained from each
patient prior to treatment. Patients were accrued to
NCCTG 90-24-51 from February of 1992 until May of
1994 and to NCCTG 94-24-52 from December of
1994 until February of 1999.
Follow-up was performed at 3- to 4-month intervals for the first 2 years, at 6-month intervals for the
next 3 years, and annually thereafter. Each evaluation
included a history and physical examination, chemistry panel, complete blood cell count, chest x-ray, and
chest computed tomography scan.
This analysis included only those patients aged
65 years (elderly) who participated in the 2 trials.
The RT alone group consisted of the elderly patients
in NCCTG 90-24-51 who received RT alone. The RT

Therapy of NSCLC in the Elderly/Schild et al.

plus chemotherapy group consisted of the elderly
patients in NCCTG 90-24-51 and NCCTG 94-24-52
who received concurrent chemotherapy plus RT.
These 2 groups were compared for baseline characteristics, toxicity, disease control, and survival in an
attempt to evaluate the risks and benefits of concurrent chemotherapy plus RT compared with RT alone
in elderly patients.
The baseline characteristics and incidences of
toxicity were compared across groups using the
Fisher exact and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests. Toxicity
was graded based on the Common Toxicity Criteria
(version 1). Survival rates were calculated from the
time of randomization using the Kaplan-Meier
method, and differences between the groups were
evaluated with the log-rank test. Cumulative incidence methods were used to calculate the local failure rates (within the treatment fields) and the distant
failure rates (failures that occurred elsewhere). This
method was used to account for the competing risks
from other causes of failure, because only the first
sites of failure were recorded.

RESULTS
In total, 169 patients aged 65 years were enrolled in
the 2 trials, including 3 patients who never received
study treatment and were excluded from all analyses.
Thirty-seven patients received RT alone, and 129
patients received RT plus chemotherapy. At the time of
closure, NCCTG 90-24-51 included 37 elderly patients
who received RT alone but only 13 elderly patients who
received both chemotherapy and RT. The small number (n 5 13) of patients who received RT plus chemotherapy in NCCTG 90-24-51 precluded us from
performing the appropriate comparison of the 2
groups within this single study. An additional 116 elderly patients received both chemotherapy and RT on
NCCTG 94-24-52. Patients aged 80 years were
uncommon and included only 4 of the 37 patients
(11%) who received RT alone and 2 of the 129 patients
(1.6%) who received combined-modality therapy.
Pretreatment characteristics for these 2 patient
groups are listed in Table 1. The RT alone group was
younger (median age, 67 years) compared with the
RT plus chemotherapy group (median age, 70 years;
rank-sum P 5 .006). The group that received RT alone
had proportionally more patients with lower performance status and greater weight loss prior to therapy. Of the patients who received RT alone, 10.8%
had an ECOG performance status of 2 compared
with only 0.8% of patients who received chemotherapy plus RT (P 5 .009). Of the patients who received
RT alone, 16.2% had a weight loss of from 5% to 10%

plus chemotherapy (P 5 .002).
Patients were followed until death with the
exception of 12 surviving patients who were followed
for a median of 87 months (range, 70–103 months).
The local-regional failure rates at 2 years and 5 years
were 24% and 38% for the RT alone group compared
with 25% and 34% for the RT plus chemotherapy
group (P 5 .53). The distant failure rates at 2 years
and 5 years were 60% and 68% for the RT alone
group compared with 40% and 47% for the RT plus
chemotherapy group (P 5 .02) (Fig. 2). The median
and 5-year survival rates were 10.5 months and 5.4%
for the RT alone group compared with 13.7 months
and 14.7% for the RT plus chemotherapy group
(P 5 .05) (Fig. 3).
Toxicity was evaluated by treatment group with
severe toxicity (grade 3) and is summarized in Table 2.
The incidence of severe toxicity (grade 3) was significantly greater in patients who received RT plus chemotherapy than in patients who received RT alone (89.9%
vs 32.4%; P < .0001). Toxicity that resulted in death
(grade 5) occurred in 1.6% of the patients who received
RT plus chemotherapy compared with 2.7% of the
patients who received RT alone (P 5 .53).
Toxicity also was evaluated in greater detail. The

both severe hematologic and nonhematologic toxicity
was greater in patients who received RT plus chemotherapy. Eighty-five percent of patients who received
RT plus chemotherapy had severe hematologic toxicity compared with 5% (P < .0001) of patients who
received RT alone. Fifty-eight percent of patients who
received RT plus chemotherapy had severe nonhematologic toxicity compared with 27% of patients

DISCUSSION
Over the past 25 years, there has been progress in the
treatment of locally advanced NSCLC that has translated
into improved patient survival.16 This improvement is
attributed mainly to the addition of platinum-based
chemotherapy to RT.3–5,17 Initially, it was observed that

sequential chemotherapy plus RT resulted in better survival than RT alone.3,4 Later, others observed that concurrent chemotherapy plus RT resulted in better survival
than sequential therapy.6,7 Despite these findings, there
has been hesitation in the use of both chemotherapy
and RT in elderly patients because of concerns of excessive toxicity and poor outcomes.18 In addition, there are
limited data regarding the treatment of elderly patients
with stage III NSCLC.
Langer et al. re-evaluated the outcome of the
patients aged 70 years who were enrolled in RTOG
Protocol 94-10,11 which was a Phase III randomized
study in which patients received either sequential
chemotherapy (cisplatin and vinblastine) then 60 Gy
of QDRT (seq-QDRT), concurrent chemotherapy (cisplatin and vinblastine) plus 60 Gy of QDRT (conQDRT), or concurrent chemotherapy (cisplatin and
etoposide) and 69.6 Gy of BIDRT (con-BIDRT). Grade
3 neutropenia and maximum toxicity per patient
were greater in elderly patients. Of those patients
who received concurrent chemotherapy and RT,
grade 3 esophagitis occurred 10% to 18% more of-

Therapy of NSCLC in the Elderly/Schild et al.

ten in the elderly patients. The median survival of
the elderly patients was more favorable for those
who received concurrent chemotherapy plus RT:
22.4 months with con-QDRT, 16.4 months with conBIDRT, and 10.8 months for seq-QDRT (P 5 .069).
Elderly patients appeared to benefit more from concurrent therapy than from sequential therapy.
We previously evaluated the relationship between
age and outcome in 1 of the 2 trials that were
included in the current analysis (NCCTG 94-24-52).10
These patients received concurrent EP and either
QDRT or BIDRT. The median and 5-year survival
rates were 15 months and 18% in patients aged
<70 years compared with 13 months and 13% in
older patients (P 5 .37). Grade 4 toxicity occurred
in 62% of patients aged <70 years compared with
81% of elderly patients (P 5 .007). More specifically,
grade 4 hematologic toxicity and pneumonitis were
significantly more common in the elderly patients.
Despite increased toxicity, elderly patients had similar survival to younger individuals. The current analysis differed from the previous evaluation of NCCTG
94-24-52, which focused on the outcome of elderly
patients compared to younger patients, because the
current study compared the results of RT to RT plus
chemotherapy in elderly patients.
Rocha Lima et al. evaluated the effects of age on
clinical outcome in a Phase III trial that was performed by the Cancer and Leukemia Group B
(CALGB).9 CALGB 9130 evaluated the use of combined-modality therapy for patients with stage III
NSCLC. Patients were randomized to receive either
cisplatin plus vinblastine followed by QDRT (60 Gy)
or cisplatin plus vinblastine followed by concurrent
carboplatin plus QDRT (60 Gy). Elderly patients had
significantly more grade 3 neutropenia (P 5 .04)
and renal toxicity (P 5 .0025). Age was not a factor in
survival (P 5 .8) or response rate (P 5 .3). As in the
analysis of NCCTG 94-24-52, elderly patients had
survival rates similar to those observed in younger
individuals but suffered more toxicity.
Atagi et al. reported the results from a Phase III
trial that was performed by the Japan Clinical Oncology Group (JCOG 9812) for elderly patients (aged
71 years) with stage III NSCLC.13 Patients were
assigned randomly to receive conventional RT alone
(60 Gy in 30 fractions) or conventional RT with concurrent carboplatin. The study was terminated early
with only 46 patients treated because of problems
with quality assurance. The JCOG RT Committee
reported that only 40% of the patients had RT fields
judged to be protocol compliant in terms of tumor
coverage or normal lung restrictions. The median
survival for the 46 patients was 14.3 months in the

367

RT arm compared with 18.5 months in the chemotherapy plus RT arm (P > .05). The JCOG initiated a
new trial, JCOG 0301, which includes a prospective
quality-assurance program and a study design identical to that used in JCOG 9812.
The results of RTOG 94-10, CALGB 9130, and
NCCTG 94-24-52 are reasonably consistent. In all
3 studies, it was observed that elderly patients
experienced more myelosuppression as a result of
combined-modality therapy. Elderly patients also
experienced more nonhematologic toxicity: They had
more pneumonitis in NCCTG 94-24-52, more esophagitis in RTOG 94-10, and more renal complications
in CALGB 9130. Despite the increased level of toxicity
experienced by the elderly patients, their survival
was similar to that observed in younger individuals.
The current analysis complements the findings
from the literature by providing some of the only
available data regarding the potential value of concurrent chemotherapy plus RT compared with RT
alone in the elderly. It appears that chemotherapy
plus RT is likely to improve survival in the elderly
like it does in younger patients.
For the current analysis, we used a cut-off age of
65 years to define elderly with the understanding
that the aging is a gradual process that results in
decreased organ function. In western societies, adults
are declared to be old when they reach ages 60 years
to 65 years.19 The use of age 65 years rather than
age 70 years allowed us to evaluate a larger
cohort, which was necessary to perform the current
analysis. In addition, the cut-off age of >65 years to
define elderly patients has been used by other investigators.20
Limitations of the current study include the retrospective methodology and the relatively small size
of the RT alone group. There was an apparent imbalance between the groups’ performance status and
weight loss. However, an appropriate multivariate
analysis evaluating the benefit of therapy while adjusting for baseline factors was not possible because
of the small subset of patients (n 5 37) who received
RT alone. In addition, elderly patients who participated in these trials probably were more physically
fit and motivated than ordinary elderly patients. These
factors may have biased the findings.
The survival results from the current analysis are
almost identical to those reported by Dillman et al. In
CALGB 8433, patients with stage III NSCLC were
assigned randomly to receive either RT alone (60 Gy) or
induction chemotherapy (vinblastine and cisplatin)
followed by RT.3 The median and 5-year survival rates
were 9.6 months and 6% for RT alone versus 13.7
months and 17% for the combined therapy (P 5 .01).

368

CANCER

The current study produced median and 5-year survival
rates of 10.5 months and 5.4% for the RT alone group
compared with 13.7 months and 14.7% for the RT plus
chemotherapy group (P 5 .05). The survival benefits
associated with RT plus chemotherapy compared with
RT alone were similar for the elderly patients in the current study and patients of various ages in the CALGB
trial.
Despite the increase in toxicity that accompanied
combined-modality therapy in elderly patients, it
appeared that they achieved disease control and survival similar to those achieved by younger patients.9,10
The results from the current analysis and from JCOG
9812 suggested an advantage to chemotherapy plus RT
compared with RT alone.13 The RTOG 94-10 results
suggested that elderly patients had better survival with
the more aggressive regimen of concurrent therapy
rather than sequential therapy.11 These findings support the use of combined-modality therapy for locally
advanced NSCLC in fit elderly patients.
Historically, elderly patients were not well represented in clinical trials. Trials written specifically for
the elderly will accrue significantly more elderly
patients and will help optimize therapy for these
patients.21 Currently, the NCCTG has a Phase II trial
for elderly patients with stage III NSCLC that
includes cetuximab plus RT. It is hoped that the
addition of cetuximab will provide better survival
than RT alone but with a more favorable toxicity profile than conventional chemotherapy.
