Abstract
Gefitinib resistance remains a major problem in the treatment of lung
adenocarcinoma. However, the molecular mechanisms of gefitinib resistance are not
fully understood. In this study, we characterized the critical role of transcription factor
Forkhead box protein M1 (FOXM1) in gefitinib resistance of lung adenocarcinoma cells.
In vitro drug sensitivity assays demonstrated that FOXM1 inhibition sensitized PC9/
GR and HCC827/GR cells to gefitinib, whereas FOXM1 overexpression enhanced PC9
and HCC827 cell resistance to gefitinib. Increased FOXM1 resulted in the upregulation
of hepatocyte growth factor receptor (MET), which led to activation of the protein
kinase B (AKT) pathway, whereas knockdown of FOXM1 did the opposite. FOXM1
bound directly to the MET promoter regions and regulated the promoter activities
and the expression of MET at the transcriptional level. Moreover, MET/AKT pathway
upregulated the expression of FOXM1 in lung adenocarcinoma cells. Inhibition of
pAKT by LY294002 or inhibition of pMET by PHA-665752 significantly inhibited
the expression of FOXM1 in lung adenocarcinoma cells. Importantly, we further
demonstrated that the expression levels of FOXM1, pAKT and MET were significantly
increased in lung adenocarcinoma tissues relative to normal lung tissues, and these
three biomarkers were concomitantly overexpressed in lung adenocarcinoma tissues.
Taken together, our results indicate that FOXM1 promotes acquired resistance to
gefitinib of lung adenocarcinoma cells, and FOXM1 crosstalks with MET/AKT signaling
to form a positive feedback loop to promote lung adenocarcinoma development.

is a specific and effective epidermal growth factor receptor
tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs), and it has been
studied and used to treat lung adenocarcinoma patients
with activating EGFR mutations, such as exon 19 deletion
and exon 21 L858R mutation [4, 5]. However, despite
initial dramatic response in patients harboring such EGFR
mutations, most patients will eventually develop acquired
resistance to EGFR-TKIs [6–8]. Several mechanisms
underlying acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs have been
identified, including secondary EGFR T790M mutation,
MET amplification and HER2 amplification [9–11].
Elucidation of novel mechanisms underlying the acquired
resistance to EGFR-TKIs is important for developing
personalized therapeutics to treat patients with lung
adenocarcinoma.
As a typical proliferation-associated transcription
factor, FOXM1 mainly exerts its function in tumorigenesis
through transcriptional regulation of its target genes to
initiate various cellular responses, including cell growth,
proliferation, differentiation, longevity and transformation
[12–14]. It belongs to a large family of evolutionary
conserved transcription factors that were characterized
by a conserved DNA binding domain called Forkhead
or winged-helix domain [14–16]. FOXM1 is frequently
overexpressed in many human cancers, and its expression
is associated with poor cancer outcomes [14, 17–23].
Previous studies have shown that FOXM1 is broadly
involved in drug resistance [23–28]. Furthermore, several
studies indicates that FoxM1 plays an important role in the
resistance of cancer cells to gefitinib [29–32]. However,
the molecular mechanisms underlying cancer cells
resistance to gefitinib are still not fully understood.
Approximately 20–25% of EGFR-TKI resistance
arises due to the amplification of MET, a gene that
encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase for hepatocyte growth
factor [33, 34]. The MET signaling pathway has been
implicated in the development and progression of various
cancers including lung cancer, but the mechanisms
regulating its expression are not fully understood [35].
The MET amplification results in continuous activation
of the phosphoinosmde-3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT signaling
pathway, which is the major downstream signaling routes
of EGFR [35]. Like the MET signaling pathway, which
is also aberrantly activated in lung cancer, the PI3K/AKT
pathway is strongly activated and plays a very important
role in lung cancer development as well as EGFR-TKI
resistance [36]. Moreover, the function of FOXM1 was
reported to be mediated by PI3K/AKT signaling pathway
[21, 37–39]. These findings suggest that MET/AKT/
FOXM1 signaling pathway may play an important role in
the resistance of lung adenocarcinoma cells to gefitinib.
In the study, we investigate the role of FOXM1 in
the resistance of lung adenocarcinoma cells to gefitinib,
and define a novel regulatory pathway directly linking
the MET/AKT signaling axis to FOXM1. We found that
FOXM1 bound directly to the promoter regions of MET
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

and regulated expression of MET at the transcriptional
level. We also found that FOXM1 was regulated by
MET through PI3K/AKT signaling pathway and that the
feedback regulation loop between FOXM1 and MET/AKT
signaling pathway could play a pivotal role in gefitinib
resistance of lung adenocarcinoma cells. Moreover, we
demonstrated that expression levels of FOXM1, MET and
pAKT were significantly higher in lung adenocarcinoma
tissues than in normal lung tissues, and these three
biomarkers were concomitantly overexpressed in lung
adenocarcinoma tissues. Thus, our findings elucidated a
novel FOXM1/MET/AKT regulatory feedback loop and
identified that FOXM1 might be a target for overcoming
gefitinib resistance in lung adenocarcinoma.

RESULTS
Characteristics of gefitinib-resistant lung
adenocarcinoma cells
Both PC9 and HCC827 cells had exon 19 deletion
(E746-A750 deletion) in EGFR and showed strong
sensitivity to gefitinib. To develop an in vitro model of
acquired gefitinib resistance, we continuously exposed
PC9 and HCC827 cells to gefitinib. After approximately
6 months of exposure, gefitinib-resistant PC9 (PC9/GR)
and gefitinib-resistant HCC827 (HCC827/GR) cells were
established. When we analyzed the EGFR mutational
status in the exon 18 to 21 by performing sequencing,
there was no difference between the PC9 and PC9/GR
cells, and between the HCC827 and HCC827/GR cells.
Compared with parental PC9 and HCC827 cells, PC9/GR
and HCC827/GR cells are larger in size and have irregular
distributions before cell fusion. Acquired resistance to
gefitinib was confirmed by MTT assays for PC9/GR and
HCC827/GR cells. As shown in Figure 1A and 1B, PC9/
GR and HCC827/GR cells were significantly resistant to
gefitinib compared to parental PC9 and HCC827 cells
in a dose or time-dependent manner, respectively. The
IC50 value of gefitinib in PC9 cells was 0.74 ± 0.11 μM,
compared to 13.66 ± 0.62 μM in PC9/GR cells. The IC50
value of gefitinib in HCC827 cells was 0.04 ± 0.01 μM,
compared to 10.06 ± 0.43 μM in HCC827/GR cells.
Predominant accumulation in S phase was observed in
PC9/GR and HCC827/GR cells compared with PC9 and
HCC827 cells, respectively. No significant deviation in
apoptosis was observed.

FOXM1 mediates gefitinib resistance in lung
adenocarcinoma cells
To test the significance of FOXM1 interference in
lung adenocarcinoma cells, we transfected pcDNA3.1FOXM1 plasmid into PC9 and HCC827 cells, and
transfected FOXM1 shRNA into PC9/GR and HCC827/
GR cells. Western blot and qRT-PCR assays were

performed to confirm the transfection efficiency. As shown
in Figure 1C and 1D, FOXM1 overexpression promoted
PC9 and HCC827 cell resistance to gefitinib treatment,
whereas knockdown of FOXM1 increased gefitinib
sensitivity of PC9/GR and HCC827/GR cells. In addition,
we determined the effect of FOXM1 on DNA synthesis
and cell proliferation using an EdU assay. Compared to
the pcDNA3.1 group, the number of EdU-positive cells
significantly increased upon FOXM1 overexpression,
suggesting that FOXM1 overexpression increased the
DNA synthesis upon gefitinib treatment (Figure 1E
and 1F). Simultaneously, compared to the shNC group, the
number of EdU-positive cells significantly decreased upon
FOXM1 knockdown, suggesting that FOXM1 knockdown
inhibited the DNA synthesis upon gefitinib treatment
(Figure 1E and 1F). Taken together, these results strongly
suggested that FOXM1 was involved in mediating the
response to gefitinib in lung adenocarcinoma cell lines.

shown in Figure 3B, western blot assays showed that the
protein levels of FOXM1, pMET, MET and pAKT were
significantly decreased by FOXM1 knockdown in PC9/
GR and HCC827/GR cells. In line with our above results,
quantitative real-time PCR analyses showed that FOXM1
and MET mRNA levels were significantly decreased by
FOXM1 knockdown in PC9/GR and HCC827/GR cells
(Figure 3B). To investigate whether the activation of the
AKT pathway by FOXM1 depends on MET, we used
PHA-665752 (a potent and selective inhibitor of MET)
to block MET phosphorylation in PC9 and HCC827 cells.
Our results showed that FOXM1 transfection significantly
upregulated the expressions of FOXM1, pMET, MET and
pAKT, but this effect was partially inhibited by PHA665752 treatment (Figure 3C–3F). Collectively, these
results indicate that FOXM1 activates the AKT pathway
through MET in lung adenocarcinoma cells.

FOXM1 is a transcriptional activator of MET

FOXM1 reduces G1 arrest and apoptosis of
lung adenocarcinoma cells following gefitinib
exposure

To dissect the molecular mechanism of the effects of
FOXM1 on MET expression, we analyzed the sequences
of MET promoter for the potential FOXM1-binding
elements. Intriguingly, we identified a putative FOXM1binding element in the MET promoter region (Figure 4A).
To explore whether FOXM1 directly regulates MET, we
first performed ChIP assays in PC9 and HCC827 cells. The
results suggested that MET chromatins were specifically
immunoprecipitated with antibody against FOXM1,
compared with the IgG control (Figure 4B). Moreover, a
series of reporter gene constructs based on the potential
binding sites were generated (Figure 4A). These reporter
constructs were cotransfected into PC9 and HCC827 cells
with FOXM1 shRNA, pcDNA3.1–FOXM1 or control
vector. As shown in Figure 4C, knockdown of FOXM1
significantly decreased the MET promoter activity in the
P2605 construct, and altered expression of FOXM1 did
not change the promoter activity in the P2118 construct,
which did not contain the potential FOXM1 binding site.
We mutated the putative binding sites within the luciferase
reporter constructs (Figure 4A). As shown in Figure 4D,
knockdown of FOXM1 significantly reduced the activity
of the WT (wild-type) pLuc-MET construct in PC9 and
HCC827 cells, and altered expression of FOXM1 did
not change the activity of the MT (mutant) pLuc-MET
construct. Additionally, FOXM1 overexpression markedly
increased the MET promoter activity in the P2605
construct, and altered expression of FOXM1 did not change
the promoter activity in the P2118 construct (Figure 4E).
Collectively, these results support that FOXM1 is an
authentic and direct transcriptional activator for MET.

We examined gefitinib-induced cell cycle arrest
and apoptosis in PC9, HCC827, PC9/GR and HCC827/
GR cells following pcDNA3.1-FOXM1 or FOXM1
shRNA transfection. As shown in Figure 2A, FOXM1
overexpression resulted in a decreased percentage of
PC9 and HCC827 cells in G1 phase, whereas downregulation of FOXM1 triggered PC9/GR and HCC827/
GR cell cycle arrest in G1 phase. In addition, a significant
decrease in apoptosis was observed in PC9 and HCC827
cells transfected with FOXM1 after gefitinib treatment
compared with control transfected cells, whereas a
marked increase in apoptosis was found in PC9/GR and
HCC827/GR cells transfected with FOXM1 shRNA after
gefitinib treatment compared with control transfected cells
(Figure 2B). These data clearly indicated that FOXM1
overexpression in lung adenocarcinoma cells attenuated
cell apoptosis and G1 arrest effects of gefitinib.

FOXM1 activates the AKT pathway through
MET in lung adenocarcinoma cells
We examined the expression levels of FOXM1
and related molecules in lung adenocarcinoma cells by
western blot and quantitative real-time PCR. Notably,
the expression levels of FOXM1, pMET, MET and
pAKT were increased in PC9/GR and HCC827/GR
cells relative to those in the parental cells, respectively
(Figure 3A). We next explored the regulatory relationship
between FOXM1 and the MET/AKT signaling pathway.
To determine whether FOXM1 is a key mediator of
the MET/AKT signaling pathway, negative control
shRNA (shNC) and FOXM1 shRNA (shFOXM1) were
transfected into PC9/GR and HCC827/GR cells. As

western blot assays showed that the protein levels of
FOXM1, pMET, MET and pAKT were significantly

PCR analyses showed that FOXM1 and MET mRNA
levels were significantly decreased by MET knockdown in
PC9/GR and HCC827/GR cells. To dissect whether MET
regulates FOXM1 through the AKT pathway, we examined
FOXM1 expression after inhibition of PI3K/AKT

pathway using LY294002. As shown in Figure 5C–5F,
our results showed that MET transfection significantly
upregulated the expressions of FOXM1, pMET, MET and
pAKT, but this effect was partially inhibited by LY294002
treatment. These data combined with that FOXM1
activates the AKT pathway through MET demonstrate
that there exists a positive feedback regulation between
FOXM1 and the MET/AKT signaling pathway in lung
adenocarcinoma cells.

knockdown and gefitinib led to marked inhibition of the
tumor growth compared with either FOXM1 knockdown
or gefitinib monotherapy (Figure 6A–6C). Western blot
and qRT-PCR analyses showed that compared with
either FOXM1 knockdown or gefitinib monotherapy
group, the expressions of FOXM1, MET and pAKT were
significantly decreased in the FOXM1 knockdown plus
gefitinib treatment group, which was further confirmed
by immunohistochemical examination of xenograft tumor
sections (Figure 6D–6F). Immunohistochemical analysis
also showed that the cell proliferation marker Ki67 was
significantly downregulated in the FOXM1 knockdown
plus gefitinib treatment group. Collectively, these results
suggest that knockdown of FOXM1 is a useful treatment
to overcome gefitinib resistance in vivo.

gefitinib monotherapy did not have significant effects

adenocarcinoma samples. We analyzed the significance
of the FOXM1/MET/AKT axis in a total of 64 pairs
of lung adenocarcinoma specimens and adjacent noncancerous specimens. As shown in Figure 7A, the mRNA
expressions of FOXM1 and MET were confirmed to be
higher in lung adenocarcinoma specimens than in adjacent
non-cancerous specimens. Importantly, we observed that
tumors exhibiting high FOXM1 mRNA expression also
expressed elevated mRNA levels of MET, indicating that
a positive correlation between FOXM1 mRNA and MET
mRNA levels (Figure 7B). Also, in the same set of lung
adenocarcinoma specimens and adjacent non-cancerous
specimens, we examined the expressions of FOXM1, MET
and pAKT by western blot and immunohistochemical
analyses (Figure 7C–7E). As shown in Figure 7C–7E, the
protein expressions of FOXM1, MET and pAKT were

confirmed to be higher in lung adenocarcinoma specimens
than in adjacent non-cancerous specimens. Moreover,
Spearman rank correlation analysis showed significant
positive correlations between FOXM1 and MET protein
levels, FOXM1 and pAKT protein levels, MET and pAKT
protein levels (Figure 7F and 7G). These results support
our finding that FOXM1, MET and pAKT are strictly
coexpressed in lung adenocarcinoma specimens and our
findings in model systems find a close parallel in clinical
samples.

unexplored. Establishment of drug-resistant sublines
and comparative investigations with their parental
cells are useful approaches that can be used to identify
functional molecules involved in the mechanism of drug

resistance. In the present study, two gefitinib-sensitive
lung adenocarcinoma cell lines and their sub-lines with
enhanced gefitinib resistance were studied to systemically
address the role of FOXM1 in gefitinib resistance of
lung adenocarcinoma cells. First, we found that FOXM1

was involved in mediating the response to gefitinib, and
attenuated cell apoptosis and G1 arrest effects of gefitinib
in lung adenocarcinoma cells. Second, the expression
of total MET, pMET, pAKT, and FOXM1, but not total
AKT expression, were significantly increased in gefitinibresistant cells compared with sensitive cells. Third,
FOXM1 bound directly to the promoter regions of MET
and regulated expression of MET at the transcriptional
level. Fourth, FOXM1 was a downstream target of AKT
signalling, and there was a positive feedback regulation
between FOXM1 and the MET/AKT signaling pathway
in lung adenocarcinoma cells. Finally, we found
that FOXM1, MET and pAKT were concomitantly
overexpressed in lung adenocarcinoma specimens. These
results clearly indicate that the regulatory feedback
between FOXM1 and MET/AKT pathway may represent
a critical mechanism of gefitinib resistance of lung
adenocarcinoma cells.
FOXM1 is well-known for its critical role in cell
cycle progression by regulating the transition from G1 to S
phase and G2 to M phase progression, as well as to mitosis
[14]. Besides its essential roles in cell cycle regulation,
FOXM1 also emerged as an oncogenic transcription factor

with a high expression and functional impact in many
types of cancer cells [14, 17–23]. Furthermore, previous
studies indicate that FOXM1 induces chemotherapy
resistance in various cancer cells by protecting cancer cell
proliferation and abrogating apoptosis [23–28]. Gefitinib,
a selective and effective EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor,
significantly inhibits EGFR autophosphorylation and
subsequent downstream signaling pathway through AKT,
and induces G1 cell cycle arrest [40]. Previous studies
have confirmed that FOXM1 was a downstream cellular
target of EGFR signaling and had an important role in
cancer development [41, 42]. Therefore, we hypothesized
that FOXM1 might be involved in gefitinib resistance of
lung adenocarcinoma cells. Here we showed that FOXM1
overexpression promoted PC9 and HCC827 cell resistance
to gefitinib treatment, whereas FOXM1 knockdown
increased gefitinib sensitivity of PC9/GR and HCC827/
GR cells. We also showed that FOXM1 overexpression
attenuated PC9 and HCC827 cell apoptosis and G1
arrest effects of gefitinib, whereas FOXM1 knockdown
promoted PC9/GR and HCC827/GR cell apoptosis and G1
arrest effects of gefitinib. In consistent with our findings,
it was also reported that FOXM1 had an important role

in the resistance of cancer cells to gefitinib [29–32].
However, the molecular mechanisms underlying FOXM1mediated gefitinib resistance in lung adenocarcinoma cells
remains to be elucidated.
To better understand the molecular mechanism by
which FOXM1 contributes to gefitinib resistance in lung
adenocarcinoma cells, we searched for the potential targets
of FOXM1. MET is known to play an important role in
lung cancer development as well as gefitinib resistance
[33, 34]. Met activation in tumor cells can occur through
several molecular mechanisms, such as overexpression,
structural alterations, and HGF-dependent or HGFindependent activation [35]. We observed no significant
difference in HGF expression between PC9 and PC9/
GR cells, and between HCC827 and HCC827/GR cells.
However, it has not been fully understood whether and
how MET amplification caused by other mechanisms
can affect sensitivity to gefitinib. We further investigated
whether FOXM1, an oncogenic transcription factor,
regulated MET expression via transcription in lung
adenocarcinoma cells. The results of the present study
showed that FOXM1 bound directly to the MET promoter
regions to promote its transcription.
Our findings also suggest the existence of a novel
positive feedback loop, which consists of FOXM1 and
MET/AKT signaling in lung adenocarcinoma cells. As
previously described, AKT is a downstream target of MET
signaling and plays a critical role in gefitinib resistance
of lung cancer cells [35, 36]. Previous studies also have
revealed that the AKT signaling pathway upregulates the
expression of FOXM1 in cancer cells [21, 37–39]. Our
study demonstrated that FOXM1 activated the MET/
AKT signaling pathway by stimulating the transcription
of MET in lung adenocarcinoma cells, and this effect
was partially inhibited by PHA-665752. Additionally,
MET activated and triggered the AKT signaling pathway,
which subsequently stimulated FOXM1 expression in
lung adenocarcinoma cells, and this effect was partially
inhibited by LY294002. Further statistical analysis
indicated that the level of FOXM1 is significantly
correlated with that of MET and with the activity of the
AKT pathway in human lung adenocarcinoma specimens.
Constitutive activation of AKT pathway has been detected
at high frequency in diverse human cancer cell lines and
tissues, including lung cancer [43]. In this study, our
results that FOXM1 is upregulated in gefitinib-resistant
lung adenocarcinoma cells and FOXM1 can stimulate
MET/AKT pathway in a positive-feedback manner
strongly suggest that FOXM1 overexpression accounts for
a novel mechanism of consecutive MET/AKT activation,
which may be a critical mechanism for gefitinib resistance
of lung adenocarcinoma cells.
Taken together, FOXM1 lies both downstream and
upstream of MET/AKT signaling pathway, and creates a
positive feedback loop to promote gefitinib resistance in
lung adenocarcinoma cells. Owing to the great importance
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

of the FOXM1/MET/AKT axis in lung adenocarcinoma,
our findings strongly indicate that targeting FOXM1
may be a promising therapeutic strategy for overcoming
gefitinib resistance in lung adenocarcinoma.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Clinical specimens
This study was approved by the Ethics Committee
of the Fourth Military Medical University. A total of 64
pairs of lung adenocarcinoma specimens and adjacent
non-cancerous specimens were collected from patients
who had underwent resection at Tangdu Hospital Affiliated
with the Fourth Military Medical University, with written
informed consent of patients. A part of each tissue was
immediately snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen while the other
part was fixed in formalin for histological examination.
None of the patients underwent chemotherapy or other
adjuvant treatments before surgery.

Cell culture and reagents
The PC9 and HCC827 cell lines, which were derived
from patients with pulmonary adenocarcinoma carrying
an in-frame deletion in EGFR exon 19 (E746-A750
deletion), show strong sensitivity to gefitinib. The PC9
cells and HCC827 cells were obtained from SigmaAldrich Corporation (St. Louis, MO) and American Type
Culture Collection (ATCC), respectively. The gefitinibresistant PC9 cell line (PC9/GR) and HCC827 cell line
(HCC827/GR) were established by following the protocol
described in a previous study [44]. All cells were cultured
in RPMI 1640 with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco BRL,
Gaithersburg, MD), 100 U/mL penicillin (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA), and 100 mg/mL streptomycin, and were
incubated at 37°C in 5% CO2 humidified air. Gefitinib
was obtained from AstraZeneca and dissolved in
DMSO at various concentrations and quantities, per the
experimental design. The specific PI3K/AKT inhibitor
LY294002 was purchased from Cell Signaling Technology
and was used at a final concentration of 10 μM. The
specific MET inhibitor PHA-665752 was purchased from
Selleck Chemicals (Houston, TX) and was used at a final
concentration of 0.1 μM.

Plasmids, shRNA and transfection
The pcDNA3.1-FOXM1 (FOXM1) and pcDNA3.1MET (MET) plasmids were constructed in our laboratory.
The shRNA for FOXM1 (shFOXM1), MET(shMET) and
negative control shRNA (shNC) were obtained from Santa
Cruz Biotechnology (Dallas, TX). Transfections were
performed with Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA) using 1–2 mg of expression vector/ml
serum-free medium as described by the manufacturer.

manufacturer’s protocol. Data were analyzed according
to the comparative Ct method [46]. The β-actin was
used as an internal control for each specific gene. Three
independent experiments were performed to analyze the
relative gene expression. Primer sequences are listed in
Supplementary Table S1.

Cell survival was measured by 3-(4,
5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide
(MTT) assay. Untransfected or transfected cells were
re-seeded into 96-well plates and incubated at 37°C in
humidified 5% CO2 for 48 hrs. Serially diluted gefitinib
was added, and the cells were incubated for an additional
72 hrs. The absorbance at 490 nm (A490) of each well
was measured on a spectrophotometer. Three independent
experiments were performed in quadruplicate.

Western blot analysis
Cells were harvested and homogenized with lysis
buffer, and western immunoblotting was performed using
standard procedures. Total protein was separated on 10%
SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to PVDF membrane
(Millipore, Bedford, MA). The membrane was blocked
with 5% nonfat dry milk in TBS, then probed with the
antibody against FOXM1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology,
Dallas, TX), pAKT (Abcam, Cambridge, MA), AKT
(Abcam, Cambridge, MA), MET (Abcam, Cambridge,
MA), pMET (Abcam, Cambridge, MA) and tubulin
(Abcam, Cambridge, MA). After washing, horseradish
peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, Dallas, TX) was used as a secondary
antibody and incubated for 1 h at room temperature.
Quantification of band intensity was performed using
Image J software.

EdU proliferation assay	
To measure cell proliferation, an EdU (5-ethynyl2ʹ-deoxyuridine) proliferation assay was performed as
described previously [45]. The cells were plated in 24well plates at a density of 5 × 104 cells/well, then treated
with 0.1 μM gefitinib for 72 hrs. Cells were washed with
PBS, then incubated in serum-free DMEM containing
10 μmol/L EdU (RiboBio, Guangzhou, China) for 2 hrs.
Cells were fixed, then underwent Apollo staining and DNA
staining, according to the manufacturer’s instructions
to detect the number of cycling cells during the EdU
treatment. The cells were imaged using fluorescence
microscopy, and the number of proliferating cells was
averaged to calculate the labeling index.

Immunohistochemistry

Flow cytometry for apoptosis and cell cycle
analysis

The immunostaining technique was conducted
as described previously [22]. The intensity of staining
was scored as 0 (negative), 1 (weak), 2 (medium) or 3
(strong), while the extent of staining was scored as 0 (0%
of cells stained), 1 (1–25%), 2 (26–50%), 3 (51–75%) or
4 (76–100%). The scores of each tumor sample were
multiplied to give a final score of 0–12.

The cells transfected with pcDNA3.1, FOXM1,
shFOXM1 or shNC were treated with 0.1 μM gefitinib for
72 hrs and harvested. For the cell cycle assay, cells were
washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and
fixed with ice-cold 70% ethanol overnight at –20°C. Fixed
cells were rehydrated in PBS for 20 min and subjected to
PI/RNase staining. Flow cytometry was performed using a
FACScan instrument (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes,
NJ), and analysis was performed with CellQuest software
(Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ). For cell apoptosis
analysis, apoptotic cells were detected with the Annexin
V-FITC Apoptosis Detection Kit (Oncogene Research
Products, Boston, MA) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions and analyzed using flow cytometry (Becton
Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ).

Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay
Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays were
performed in lung adenocarcinoma cells following the
protocol provided by the manufacturer (Millipore, Bedford,
MA). Briefly, after cross-linking with formaldehyde at 1%
final concentration for 10 min at 37°C and the reaction was
quenched by addition of glycine to a final concentration
of 0.125 M. The cells were lysed in SDS buffer and the
pellet was resuspended in nuclei lysis buffer and sonicated.
Immunoprecipitation was carried out with FOXM1
antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX). The
PCR primer sequences for DNA fragments as parts of the
targeted promoters are provided in Supplementary Table S2.

Quantitative real-time PCR
Total RNA isolation from cell lines and tissues
was performed using Trizol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
CA). A reverse transcription reaction was performed
using a reverse transcription kit (Applied Biosystems,
Foster City, CA). Quantitative real-time PCR (qRTPCR) was performed on an ABI 7500 real-time system
(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) according to the
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Luciferase reporter assay
The luciferase assays were performed using a
luciferase assay kit (Promega, Madison, WI) according
to the manufacturer’s protocol. Cells were plated in
59256

BALB/C nude mice aged 4–6 weeks old were
purchased from Shanghai Laboratory Animal Center
(SLAC, Shanghai, China) and housed within a dedicated
SPF facility at the Laboratory Animal Center of the Fourth
Military Medical University. All studies were performed
following guidelines approved by the Institutional
Animal Ethics Committee of the Fourth Military Medical
University. For tumor growth evaluation, PC9/GR cells
(5 × 106) were stably transfected with shNC or shFOXM1
and subcutaneously injected into the left f﻿﻿lank of nude
mice. Xenograft size was measured daily and tumor
volume was determined as (length × width2)/2. After
one week, mice were subjected to oral treatment with
saline or gefitinib (20 mg/kg) every day. The mice were
humanely killed on day 28, and subcutaneous tumors
were surgically excised, weighed and photographed.
Immunohistochemistry, western blotting and qRT–PCR
were performed for Ki67, FOXM1, pAKT and MET.
