Abstract
Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and its receptor MET represent
validated targets for cancer therapy. However, HGF/MET inhibitors being explored as cancer therapeutics exhibit cytostatic activity rather than cytotoxic activity, which would be more desired. In
this study, we engineered an antagonistic anti-MET antibody
that, in addition to blocking HGF/MET signaling, also kills
MET-overexpressing cancer cells by antibody-dependent cellular
cytotoxicity (ADCC). As a control reagent, we engineered the same
antibody in an ADCC-inactive form that is similarly capable of
blocking HGF/MET activity, but in the absence of any effector
function. In comparing these two antibodies in multiple mouse
models of cancer, including HGF-dependent and -independent
tumor xenografts, we determined that the ADCC-enhanced antibody was more efﬁcacious than the ADCC-inactive antibody. In
orthotopic mammary carcinoma models, ADCC enhancement
was crucial to deplete circulating tumor cells and to suppress

metastases. Prompted by these results, we optimized the
ADCC-enhanced molecule for clinical development, generating
an antibody (ARGX-111) with improved pharmacologic properties. ARGX-111 competed with HGF for MET binding, inhibiting ligand-dependent MET activity, downregulated cell surface expression of MET, curbing HGF-independent MET activity, and engaged natural killer cells to kill MET-expressing
cancer cells, displaying MET-speciﬁc cytotoxic activity. ADCC
assays conﬁrmed the cytotoxic effects of ARGX-111 in multiple
human cancer cell lines and patient-derived primary tumor
specimens, including MET-expressing cancer stem-like cells.
Together, our results show how ADCC provides a therapeutic
advantage over conventional HGF/MET signaling blockade
and generates proof-of-concept for ARGX-111 clinical testing
in MET-positive oncologic malignancies. Cancer Res; 75(16);

Introduction

immune cells (1). The high-afﬁnity ligand of MET, hepatocyte
growth factor (HGF), is a pleiotropic cytokine that is secreted by
cells of mesenchymal origin, typically ﬁbroblasts and macrophages (2). HGF signaling through MET promotes a peculiar
biologic program that results from the ﬁne orchestration of
complementary biologic activities, including promigratory, mitogenic, and antiapoptotic cues (3). This process, known collectively
as invasive growth, is essential for embryogenesis, during which
HGF/MET signaling is responsible for migration, proliferation,
and survival of various progenitor cells (4). In normal adult
tissues, HGF-driven invasive growth is usually quiescent, but is
resumed following tissue injury to promote wound healing and
tissue regeneration (5).
Although HGF/MET signaling is tightly controlled in normal
tissues, it is frequently subverted in tumors, which exploit the
invasive growth program to grow within and to colonize the host
organism (6). HGF overexpression in the tumor microenvironment correlates with increased tumor aggressiveness and invasion
(7). HGF is also a powerful proangiogenic factor promoting
tumor angiogenesis (8). Aberrant activation of MET is frequently
observed in human cancer and can be due to different molecular
mechanisms, including c-MET transcriptional activation, ampliﬁcation or mutation, as well as autocrine or paracrine HGF
stimulation (9). In the clinic, MET protein overexpression and

MET, the product of the c-MET proto-oncogene, is a transmembrane tyrosine kinase that is expressed by the majority of epithelial
tissues and by endothelial, muscle, neuronal, hematopoietic, and

c-MET gene ampliﬁcation have been identiﬁed as negative prognostic markers for a variety of oncologic diseases, including lung
(10), colon (11), breast (12), head and neck (13), and gastric (14)
carcinoma, as well as multiple myeloma (15) and glioblastoma
multiforme (16).
Several inhibitors have been developed so far to tackle HGF/
MET activity in cancer, including small-molecule MET tyrosine
kinase inhibitors, anti-HGF antibodies, and anti-MET antibodies
(17–19). Surprisingly, and in striking contrast with the importance of HGF/MET signaling for survival of different cell types
during embryogenesis, HGF- or MET-targeted drugs have, however, demonstrated cytostatic rather than cytotoxic activity on
tumor cells, independently of their mechanism of action (20, 21).
In fact, even in the most MET-dependent tumors displaying c-MET
gene ampliﬁcation, inhibition of MET activity leads to G1 arrest
and not to cell death, both in cellular studies and in xenografts
(22). Consistent with this idea, HGF/MET signaling in cancer cells
is typically associated with promotion of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and with tumor progression rather than
with tumor onset (1, 4, 6, 9).
To overcome this pharmacologic limitation, and to investigate
whether MET-targeted cytotoxicity would confer a therapeutic
advantage over plain HGF/MET inhibition, we engineered an
antagonistic anti-MET antibody that, in addition to blocking both
HGF-dependent and -independent MET activation, displays
enhanced antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). At
the same time, we also engineered an ADCC-dead version of the
same antibody that inhibits HGF/MET signaling but is completely
devoid of any effector function, and compared the antitumor and
antimetastasis activity of this antibody pair in multiple mouse
models of cancer. The results presented here suggest that killing
MET-expressing cancer cells by ADCC is signiﬁcantly more
effective from a therapeutic viewpoint than simply inhibiting
HGF/MET signaling.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture
A549, BxPC3, MDA-MB-231, NCI-H1437, NCI-H2122, NCIH441, NCI-H596, Raji, SNU-5, TOV-112D, U87-MG, and 786-O
cells were purchased from the ATCC. A498, L540, MKN-45, and
U266 cells were purchased from the Deutsche Sammlung von
Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen (DSMZ). EBC-1 cells were
purchased from the Japanese Collection of Research Bioresources.
All cells were cultured according to the protocols provided by the
supplier and used within 6 months after receipt or validated by
short tandem repeat proﬁling using Cell ID System (Promega).
LOC cells (23), immortalized human mammary ﬁbroblasts (24)
and CRCM tumors (25) have been described previously.
ADCC assays
ADCC of MKN-45, NCI-H441, and A549 cells was determined
with a standard 51Cr release assay (26) using human peripheral
blood mononuclear cells from three different donors (Etablissement Français Du Sang) and a 50:1 effector:target ratio. All
experiments were performed in triplicate. The percentage of lysis
was analyzed versus antibody concentration, and the EC50 and
EMAX values were calculated using Prism software (GraphPad).
ADCC of MDA-MB-231 cells and of primary triple negative
mammary carcinoma cells was analyzed using an ADCC Reporter
Bioassay Kit (Promega). Single cell suspensions were stained with

3374 Cancer Res; 75(16) August 15, 2015

AldeFluor (Stemcell Technologies) and then sorted by FACS using
a MoFlo XDP cell sorter (Beckman Coulter). ALDH-1þ cells were
incubated with increasing ARGX-111 concentrations (0–667
nmol/L) and reporter effector cells (effector:target ratio 2.5:1),
and ADCC was measured as described by the manufacturer. Data
were analyzed and ﬁt using Prism software (GraphPad).
Subcutaneous xenograft mouse models
U87-MG or MKN-45 cells (3  106 cells/mouse) were injected
s.c. into the right or left hind ﬂank of 6- to 8-week-old CD-1 nude
mice (Charles River Laboratories). When tumor volume
approached 100 mm3, mice were randomly assigned to three
treatment arms (U87-MG, 10 mice/group; MKN-45, 6 mice/
group): irrelevant IgG1; WT52-E; and WT52-D. Antibodies were
administered two times a week by i.p. injection, and tumor
volume was monitored over time as described previously (24).
At autopsy, tumor weight was determined on freshly explanted
tumors (U87-MG). For analysis of MET and phospho-MET levels,
mice bearing MKN-45 tumors were treated with a single bolus of
WT52-E or irrelevant IgG1 (3 mice/group) and tumors were
extracted for analysis 24 hours later. Tumor sections were analyzed by immunohistochemistry using anti-MET or anti–phospho-MET antibodies (both from LSBio).
Orthotopic mammary carcinoma models
For the neoadjuvant setting, MDA-MB-231-luc cells were mixed
4:1 with immortalized human mammary ﬁbroblasts and then
injected bilaterally (2.5  106 cells/injection site) into the mammary fat pad of 6-week-old female CB17 SCID mice (Charles River
Laboratories) as described previously (24). After 3 weeks, mice
were stratiﬁed on the basis of the tumor volume and randomly
assigned to the following treatment arms (n ¼ 8): IgG1; WT52-E;
WT52-D. Antibodies were administered two times a week by i.p.
injection at a dose of 5 mg/kg IgG1. Tumor growth was monitored
over time as described previously (24). After 4 weeks of treatment, tumors were surgically removed, and neoadjuvant therapy was interrupted. Two weeks after surgery, mice were
injected with luciferin, sacriﬁced, and subjected to autopsy.
Metastatic dissemination was determined by bioluminescence
analysis of isolated lungs and femurs as described previously
(24). The number of circulating tumor cells (CTC) was determined at the indicated time points by measuring luciferase
activity on mouse blood. Approximately 100 mL of whole blood
was cleared from erythrocytes using red blood cell lysis buffer
(BD Biosciences), and CTCs were collected by centrifugation.
The cell pellet was washed in PBS and then lysed in 20 mL
luciferase assay buffer (Promega). Luciferase activity was measured on 10 mL of cell lysate using a Luciferase Reporter Assay
System kit (Promega). Samples were analyzed with a GloMax
96 Microplate Luminometer (Promega). Estimation of CTC
number was calculated using a standard curve of luciferaseexpressing MDA-MB-231 cells. For the adjuvant setting, MDAMB-231-luc cells were injected orthotopically into the mammary fat pad of 6-week-old female CB17 SCID mice along with
human mammary ﬁbroblasts as described above, and CTCs
were determined at regular time intervals. Primary tumors were
removed by surgery approximately 5 weeks after cell injection.
Two days after surgery, mice were randomized on the basis
of the CTC number and assigned to three treatment arms (10
mice/group) as above (IgG1, WT52-E, WT52-D; 5 mg/kg). After
4 weeks of treatment, mice were sacriﬁced and metastatic

orthologue FcgRIV, as well as for human and mouse FcgRI compared with WT52 (Supplementary Table S1). WT52-D displayed
very low afﬁnity for human FcgRI and no afﬁnity for human
FcgRIIIa, mouse FcgRI or mouse FcgRIV. In in vitro ADCC assays
using effector cells from three distinct donors, WT52-E displayed a

levels and invariably superior to that of WT52 (Supplementary
Table S2). WT52-D did not display any ADCC activity in any cell
line tested.

ADCC enhancement results in improved antitumor activity in
both HGF-dependent and -independent xenograft models
To determine whether ADCC enhancement provides an advantage over plain HGF/MET inhibition in mouse models of cancer,
we tested the WT52-E–WT52-D antibody pair in both HGFdependent and -independent xenograft systems. U87-MG cells,
which display an autocrine HGF/MET loop (28), were injected s.c.
into CD-1 nude mice [that have functional natural killer (NK)
cells and are, therefore, ADCC competent] to induce the formation of experimental tumors. Tumor-bearing mice were randomly
assigned to three treatment arms (irrelevant IgG1; WT52-E; WT52D), and antibodies were administered at a dose of 5 mg/kg. Tumor
burden analysis revealed that WT52-E and WT52-D inhibited
tumor growth by 88% (P ¼ 0.0003) and 51% (P ¼ 0.0159),
respectively (Fig. 1A). At the end of the experiment, the mean
weight of control tumors was 1819  331 mg, whereas that of
antibody-treated tumors was 295  103 mg (WT52-E) and 930 
215 mg (WT52-D; Fig. 1B). The activity of WT52-E and WT52-D
was also tested in an HGF-independent mouse model of cancer.

Results
Generation of an ADCC-enhanced antagonistic anti-MET
antibody for mouse studies
We recently reported the generation of a wide panel of chimeric
llama-human antagonistic anti-MET antibodies (24). The most
antagonistic molecule within this panel (WT52) blocks
both HGF-dependent MET activity (by competing with HGF for
binding to MET; Supplementary Fig. S1A and S1B) and HGFindependent MET activity (by promoting MET internalization;
Supplementary Fig. S1C and S1D). WT52 was engineered to an
ADCC-enhanced version (WT52-E) by introducing the S239D/
I332E amino acid substitutions in the CH2 domain (27). As a
control, an ADCC-inactive ("dead") mutant version of WT52
(WT52-D) was also engineered that contained the E233P/
L234V/L235A amino acid substitutions in the CH2 domain
(26). ELISA analysis of Fc receptor binding revealed that WT52-E

an orthotopic model of mammary carcinoma (24). To explore the
therapeutic potential of MET-targeted ADCC in this model, we
injected MDA-MB-231 human triple-negative mammary carcinoma cells expressing luciferase (MDA-MB-231-luc) into the mammary fat pad of SCID mice (which have functional NK cells and
are, therefore, ADCC competent). Because mouse HGF does not
activate human MET, tumor cells were injected along with HGFsecreting, immortalized human mammary ﬁbroblasts (24).
Tumor-bearing mice were randomly assigned to three treatment
arms as above (IgG1; WT52-E; WT52-D), and antibodies were
administered at a dose of 5 mg/kg. After 4 weeks of treatment,
tumors were surgically removed, and neoadjuvant therapy was
interrupted. Two weeks after surgery, mice were injected with
luciferin, sacriﬁced, and subjected to autopsy. Metastatic dissemination was determined by bioluminescence analysis of isolated
lungs and femurs (Fig. 2A). This analysis revealed that WT52-E
and WT52-D reduced tumor growth by 57% (P < 0.0001) and
20% (P ¼ 0.0271), respectively (Fig. 2B). Interestingly, however,
the effect of anti-MET antibodies was greater on metastases. In

MKN-45 human gastric carcinoma cells, which display constitutive, ligand-independent MET activation (29), were injected s.c.
into CD-1 nude mice. Tumor-bearing mice were randomized into
three treatment arms as above (IgG1; WT52-E; WT52-D), and
antibodies were administered at a dose of 1 mg/kg. In this model,
WT52-E and WT52-D inhibited tumor growth by 85% (P ¼
0.0018) and 54% (P ¼ 0.0355), respectively (Fig. 1C). In a
separate experiment using CD-1 nude mice bearing MKN-45
tumors, a single bolus of WT52-E (5 mg/kg) resulted in a significant reduction of both phospho-MET and total MET levels (Fig.
1D). Taken together, these results suggest that ADCC enhancement provides a therapeutic advantage over plain HGF/MET
signaling inhibition in both HGF-dependent and -independent
xenograft models.

ARGX-111 Kills MET-Expressing Cancer Cells by ADCC

surgery itself is often a cause of tumor cell spreading. Prompted by
this consideration, we explored the therapeutic potential of METtargeted ADCC in an adjuvant model of metastatic mammary
carcinoma in which treatment started after tumor resection. MDAMB-231-luc cells and HGF-secreting human ﬁbroblasts were
injected orthotopically into the mammary fat pad of SCID mice
as described above, and CTCs were determined at regular time
intervals. Primary tumors were removed by surgery approximately
5 weeks after cell injection. Two days after surgery, mice were
randomized on the basis of the CTC number and assigned to
three treatment arms as above (IgG1; WT52-E; WT52-D; 5 mg/kg).
After 4 weeks of treatment, mice were sacriﬁced and metastatic
dissemination was assessed by bioluminescence analysis of whole
body and isolated organs (Fig. 3A). Consistent with our work
hypothesis, CTC number burst soon after surgery and then
returned to lower levels in approximately a week (Fig. 3B).
However, although CTC number in mice receiving WT52-E

fact, WT52-E and WT52-D reduced lung metastases (Fig. 2C) by
91% (P ¼ 0.0090) and 74% (P ¼ 0.0294), respectively, and
femur metastases (Fig. 2D) by 95% (P ¼ 0.0047) and 79% (P ¼
0.0158). We also monitored the number of CTCs during the
whole experiment by measuring luciferase activity in the blood.
Before surgery, we observed neither a correlation between CTC
number and tumor volume nor a signiﬁcant difference in CTC
number among the various experimental groups (Fig. 2E).
However, interestingly, once the primary tumors were removed,
mice treated with WT52-E displayed signiﬁcantly reduced CTC
number and metastases compared with both the WT52-D and
the control group (Fig. 2F).

treated with control IgG1 or with WT52-D. At sacriﬁce, the WT52E group displayed 89% less CTCs compared with the IgG1 arm
(P ¼ 0.0274) and 81% less CTCs compared with the WT52-D arm
(P ¼ 0.0383; Fig. 3C). In vivo imaging (Supplementary Fig. S2)
revealed that WT52-E dramatically reduced whole body bioluminescence compared with both IgG1 (86%, P ¼ 0.0035) and
WT52-D (81%, P ¼ 0.0397; Fig. 3D). Bioluminescence analysis of
explanted lungs unveiled that WT52-E potently suppressed pulmonary metastases compared with both IgG1 (93%, P ¼ 0.0361)
and WT52-D (91%, P ¼ 0.0499; Fig. 3E). Similarly, WT52-E–
treated mice displayed reduced bone metastases compared with
both control mice (88%, P ¼ 0.0277) and mice of the WT52-D
arm (82%, P ¼ 0.0446; Fig. 3F). Interestingly, CTC number in each
mouse showed a direct correspondence with metastatic dissemination (Supplementary Fig. S3). We conclude that killing CTCs
by MET-targeted ADCC may be an effective strategy to prevent
tumor recurrence and to suppress metastatic dissemination.
Generation of ARGX-111, an ADCC-enhanced anti-MET
antibody for clinical development
The results obtained in mouse models of cancer suggest that
MET-targeted ADCC achieves superior tumor inhibition and
metastasis suppression compared with HGF/MET signaling
blockade. Prompted by these data, we set to develop an
ADCC-enhanced anti-MET antibody for clinical use. The llama
WT52 VH and VL framework regions display 88% average human
identity. Using phage display-based afﬁnity enrichment, we
selected a molecule with 95% human framework identity
(G52; Supplementary Fig. S4). Germlining did not affect the
major biochemical and biologic characteristics of the antibody
(Supplementary Table S3). G52 was further optimized by introducing the H433K/N434F substitutions in the CH3 region,

ARGX-111 inhibits HGF-dependent MET activity by competing
with HGF for binding to MET
The ability of ARGX-111 to inhibit HGF-dependent MET activity was determined in a variety of biochemical and biologic assays.
Flow-cytometry analysis on a panel of human tumor cell lines
expressing different MET levels unveiled that ARGX-111 binds to
native MET with an EC50 ranging from 0.1 nmol/L to 0.7 nmol/L
(Supplementary Table S5). In ELISA assays, ARGX-111 competed
with HGF displaying an IC50 of 1.3 nmol/L and an IMAX of 95%
(Fig. 4A). In MET activation experiments using A549 cells, ARGX111 inhibited HGF-induced MET autophosphorylation with
an IC50 of 5.3 nmol/L and an IMAX of 74% (Fig. 4B). Similar
results were obtained using NCI-H1437 NSCLC cells (IC50 ¼ 13.2
nmol/L; IMAX ¼ 60%; Fig. 4C). In an HGF-dependent cell
migration assay using A549 cells seeded in a Boyden chamber,

generating the G52-HN antibody. These substitutions are known
to increase binding to human FcRn at acidic pH while not affecting
its afﬁnity at neutral pH, thus enhancing antibody recycling from
the sorting endosome (30). Surface Plasmon Resonance conﬁrmed that G52-HN has a KD for human FcRn at pH 6.0 that is
approximately six times lower compared with G52 (0.255  0.01
nmol/L vs. 1.37  0.11 nmol/L). G52-HN was produced in a GSCHO cell line lacking alpha-1,6-fucosyltransferase, thus obtaining an afucosylated G52-HN antibody (hereafter referred to as
ARGX-111). Antibody afucosylation is known to increase afﬁnity
for human FcgRIIIa, thus resulting in enhanced ADCC (31). ELISA
analysis conﬁrmed that afucosylation increased antibody binding
to both V158 FcgRIIIa and F158 FcgRIIIa by at least 25 times,
whereas it did not signiﬁcantly affect hFcgRI binding (Supplementary Table S4). The major biochemical and pharmacologic
characteristics of ARGX-111 are summarized in Supplementary

ARGX-111 Kills MET-Expressing Cancer Cells by ADCC

ARGX-111 completely neutralized the promigratory effect of
HGF (Fig. 4D). In an anchorage-independent growth assay
using NCI-H1437 cells seeded in soft agar, ARGX-111 inhibited
HGF-dependent colony formation by 78% (Fig. 4E). Finally, in an
HGF-induced branching morphogenesis assay using SV40 T-antigen–transformed LOC human kidney epithelial cell spheroids
(23) and increasing antibody concentrations, ARGX-111 significantly inhibited HGF-induced branched tubule formation
already at a 1:1 molar ratio with recombinant HGF (Fig. 4F).
ARGX-111 inhibits HGF-independent MET activity by
promoting kinase-independent receptor downregulation
We next determined whether ARGX-111 could affect HGFindependent MET activity in tumor cells displaying constitutive
MET activation. In phospho-MET ELISA assays, ARGX-111
showed dose-dependent inhibition of MET autophosphorylation
in both MKN-45 cells (IC50 ¼ 0.2 nmol/L, IMAX ¼ 63%; Fig. 5A)
and EBC-1 human lung carcinoma cells (IC50 ¼ 12.7 nmol/L, IMAX
¼ 69%; Fig. 5B). Flow-cytometry analysis of MET expression

revealed that ARGX-111 promoted a rapid decrease of MET
expression levels in both MKN-45 cells (Fig. 5C) and EBC-1 cells
(Fig. 5D). Interestingly, this effect was also observed in MDA-MB231 human mammary carcinoma cells (Fig. 3E), which express
normal MET levels and retain ligand sensitivity. ARGX-111–
mediated MET downregulation was dose-dependent, reaching its
maximal effect already at 10 nmol/L (Fig. 5F). Western blot
analysis of conditioned medium (Supplementary Fig. S6A) and
of cell lysates (Supplementary Fig. S6B) demonstrated that ARGX111 does not promote receptor shedding, but reduces total MET
protein levels, suggesting that antibody binding to MET results in
receptor internalization followed by protein degradation. ARGX111–induced MET downregulation also occurred in the presence
of a highly speciﬁc MET tyrosine kinase inhibitor (JNJ-38877605;
ref. 32) in MKN-45 (Fig. 5G), EBC-1 (Fig. 5H), and MDA-MB-231
cells (Fig. 5I), suggesting that this process does not require
MET kinase activity. In contrast, MET kinase inhibition did block
HGF-induced MET internalization in MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 5I).
Western blot analysis conﬁrmed that the concentration of

ARGX-111 kills MET-expressing cancer cells in the presence of
NK cells
We investigated whether ARGX-111 could kill cancer cells by
ADCC using a representative panel of human tumor cell lines
expressing different MET levels. Cells were incubated with increasing concentrations of ARGX-111 (0-1,000 nmol/L) in the presence
of NK cells, and tumor cell lysis was determined by a standard
51
Cr-release assay. An irrelevant IgG1 and the fucosylated G52
antibody were used as controls. Each assay was repeated using
effector cells derived from three different healthy donors (Supplementary Table S6). This analysis revealed that ARGX-111 induces
dose-dependent lysis of all tumor cell lines tested with an efﬁcacy
directly proportional to MET protein expression levels. The fucosylated G52 antibody displayed only a modest ADCC activity on
MKN-45 cells, which express very high MET levels, but did not have
any effect on the other cell lines tested (Supplementary Fig. S7A).
We also analyzed ARGX-111-induced antibody-dependent cellular
phagocytosis (ADCP) using MKN-45 cells or 786-O human renal
cell carcinoma cells and human monocyte-derived macrophages.
Consistent with our ﬁnding that afucosylation does not signiﬁcantly change antibody afﬁnity for FcgRI (Supplementary Table S4),
ARGX-111 did not display increased ADCP compared with G52 in
any condition tested (Supplementary Fig. S7B).
MET-targeted ADCC kills mammary carcinoma stem cells
The results obtained in the orthotopic mammary carcinoma
models indicate that MET-targeted ADCC impairs the ability of
CTCs to colonize distant organs and to give rise to metastases.
Because only tumor cells with stem-like characteristics are competent to originate secondary colonies, we hypothesized that the
mammary carcinoma stem cell population may express MET. To
test this hypothesis, we analyzed coexpression of MET with
established breast cancer stem cell markers (33) in MDA-MB231 tumors as well as in a vital library of patient-derived breast
xenografts (CRCM tumors; ref. 25) generated by implantation of
primary mammary carcinomas into immunodeﬁcient mice (Fig.
6A). Interestingly, all triple-negative tumors from this library

expressed MET (Fig. 6B). Flow-cytometry analysis of CD24, CD44
and MET unveiled that the majority of cells in the CD44þ/CD24lo
population express MET in both the MDA-MB-231 cell line (99%)
and the primary breast carcinoma samples (78%–98%; Supplementary Table S7). Similarly, dual staining with AldeFluor reaction and anti-MET antibodies revealed that ALDH-1–positive
tumor cells express MET in all samples analyzed (Fig. 7A).
Prompted by these data, we determined whether MET-targeted
ADCC could kill mammary carcinoma stem cells in vitro. To this
end, cells derived from MDA-MB-231, CRCM168, CRCM174, and
CRCM389 tumors were stained with AldeFluor and then sorted by
FACS. Sorted cells were incubated with increasing ARGX-111
concentrations (0–667 nmol/L) in the presence of bioluminescent ADCC reporter cells (34), and ADCC was determined by
analyzing luciferase activity. Remarkably, ARGX-111 promoted
dose-dependent ADCC of all stem cell populations analyzed (Fig.
7B). We conclude that MET-targeted ADCC may be an effective
method to eliminate breast cancer stem cells.

Discussion
HGF and its receptor MET have been attracting increasing
interest in the last two decades as appealing targets for cancer
therapy. This interest has led to the development of numerous
targeted drugs, some of which have reached the clinic. The
initial enthusiasm has been partially mitigated, however, by the
realization that anti-HGF/MET drugs display cytostatic rather
than cytotoxic activity in most systems, including cell-based
assays, mouse models of cancer, and oncologic patients. In this
study, we report the engineering of an antagonistic anti-MET
antibody that, in addition to inhibiting HGF/MET signaling,
kills MET-expressing tumor cells by enhanced ADCC. The data
presented here suggest that depleting MET-positive cancer cells
is therapeutically more effective than simply inhibiting HGF/
MET signaling.
These results must be interpreted at the light of the role played by
MET in cancer biology. It has been shown that tumors take
advantage of HGF/MET signaling in two different situations,
determined by the number of c-MET gene copies contained in
their genome (22). Tumors bearing normal c-MET gene copynumber exploit paracrine HGF stimulation to proliferate in adverse

environmental conditions and to invade adjacent tissues, but do
not strictly depend on HGF/MET signaling for their own survival.
In this setting, inhibition of HGF/MET signaling attenuates proliferation and invasion, but does not eliminate MET-expressing
cancer cells per se. On the other hand, tumors displaying highgrade focal c-MET ampliﬁcation totally rely on constitutive HGFindependent MET signaling, resulting from MET protein overexpression, to sustain their proliferation and EMT phenotype
(35, 36). In these tumors, MET inhibition leads to G1 arrest and
to transient reversion of EMT; however, both proliferation and EMT
can be resumed upon removal of MET blockade (20). Therefore,
whether we are hindering HGF-mediated oncogenic "expedience"
in tumors bearing normal c-MET gene copy-number or METdependent oncogenic "addiction" in c-MET–ampliﬁed lesions, we
are temporarily preventing tumor cells to carry out their malignant
program, but we are not eradicating them.

This notion acquires high therapeutic relevance in light of the
emerging evidence that MET is expressed and functionally
required in the stem cell compartment of several tumor types,
including head and neck carcinoma (37), colorectal carcinoma
(38), prostate cancer (39), breast cancer (40), and glioblastoma
multiforme (41). In analogy with normal tissue stem cells, cancer
stem cells represent a multipotent tumor cell subpopulation that
possesses the ability to replicate indeﬁnitely and to give rise to
secondary tumor colonies with the full differentiation spectrum of
the primary lesion. Circulating cancer cells with stem-like characteristics are the only cell type that can give rise to metastases and
are often drug resistant (42). Following therapy interruption,
residual cancer stem cells that survived treatment may resume
their proliferative cycle, reconquer space in the host organism, and
give rise to malignant lesions, resulting in new metastases or
tumor recurrence (43). From a therapeutic viewpoint, killing

rather than simply inhibiting the proliferation of cancer stem cells
may be associated with a greater patient beneﬁt.
The possibility to intercept MET-positive CTCs with stemlike properties generates a new paradigm for the treatment of
MET-positive tumors. So far, MET-targeted therapy has been
envisioned either for causing the regression of established
HGF/MET-dependent lesions or for overcoming HGF/METdriven resistance to a second anticancer drug (44). The data
presented here suggest that these strategies may not exploit the
full therapeutic potential of an ADCC-enhanced anti-MET
antibody, and point at the neoadjuvant and adjuvant settings
as valid alternative approaches. Indeed, CTCs are ultimately
responsible for tumor recurrence or metastasis onset following
surgery, independently of how well the original lesion has
responded to a previous therapy. On the basis of the results
obtained in our neoadjuvant and adjuvant orthotopic breast
cancer models, it would be reasonable to expect that eradication of CTCs by MET-targeted ADCC is associated with prolonged disease-free survival. Importantly, this opportunity is
unique to an ADCC-enhanced anti-MET antibody. In fact,
inhibition of HGF/MET signaling using a conventional
HGF/MET–targeted drug, whether an antibody or a small
molecule, would probably be able to prevent the escape of
cancer cells from a primary lesion, but would have no effect on
the survival of metastasis-initiating cells once they are in
circulation, especially if these cells have become resistant to
anoikis during their journey from the home epithelium to the
breakout vessel.
Although MET plays its most relevant physiologic role
during embryo development and remains mostly silent during
the adult stage, it is widely expressed in epithelial and endothelial tissues of virtually all organs. This broad expression
pattern could raise the concern that MET-targeted ADCC may
cause damage to normal tissues, resulting in systemic toxicity.
However, toxicologic studies conducted in cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) indicate that this is not the case. In
fact, although ARGX-111 does not cross-react with mouse
MET, it binds with high afﬁnity to simian MET and to simian
FcgRIIIa (Supplementary Table S4). In a large study involving
40 adult animals, the no-observed adverse event level of
ARGX-111 corresponded to a dose of 30 mg/kg administered
weekly (data on ﬁle). These results suggest that MET-targeted
ADCC may be well tolerated by normal tissues expressing
MET and may, therefore, not interfere with housekeeping
physiologic functions at doses that are active against METdependent tumors. More deﬁnitive data on ARGX-111 safety

will emerge from the phase I study that has started in January
2014 (NCT02055066).
