Abstract
Although recent reports suggest that selenium can modulate
the activity of cytotoxic drugs, the mechanism underlying
this activity remains unclear. This has been investigated
using a panel of human B-cell lymphoma cell lines. The cytotoxic effects of chemotherapeutic agents (e.g., doxorubicin,
etoposide, 4-hydroperoxycyclophosphamide, melphalan, and
1-B-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine) were increased by up to 2.5fold when combined with minimally toxic concentrations
(EC5-10) of the organic selenium compound, methylseleninic
acid (MSA). DNA strand breaks were identified using comet
assays, but the measured genotoxic activity of the combinations did not explain the observed synergistic effects in cell
death. However, minimally toxic (EC10) concentrations of
MSA induced a 50% decrease in nuclear factor-KB (NF-KB)
activity after an exposure of 5 h, similar to that obtained
with the specific NF-KB inhibitor, BAY 11-7082. Combinations of BAY 11-7082 with these cytotoxic drugs also resulted
in synergism, suggesting that the chemosensitizing activity
of MSA is mediated, at least in part, by its effects on NFKB. Basal intracellular selenium concentration was higher
in a MSA-sensitive cell line. After exposure to MSA, methylselenocysteine and selenomethionine were identified as the
main intracellular species generated. Volatile selenium species, trapped using solid-phase microextraction fibers, were
identified as dimethylselenide and dimethyldiselenide. These
volatile species are thought to be the most biologically active
forms of selenium. Taken together, these results show that
the NF-KB pathway is one target for MSA underlying the interaction between MSA and chemotherapy. These data encourage
the further clinical development of selenium as a potential
modulator of cytotoxic drug activity in B-cell lymphomas.

Introduction
Selenium is an essential trace element that has immunomodulatory activity (1, 2), and also has several functions relevant to
cancer medicine. At low concentration, selenium compounds act
as antioxidants, thereby protecting DNA, most likely via
selenoproteins such as glutathione peroxidase and thioredoxin

reductase (3). Selenium supplementation studies have reported a
decreased incidence of specific cancers, most notably prostate
cancer (4, 5). Large randomized chemoprevention studies, such
as the Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial, are in
progress.
Several studies have reported that selenium, at supranutritional
concentrations, may modulate the activity of cytotoxic chemotherapy. In a study from our own research group, serum selenium
concentration at diagnosis was predictive of dose delivery, treatment response, and long-term survival in a group of 99 patients
with aggressive non–Hodgkin’s lymphoma. Response to first
treatment was 54% in the lowest serum quartile compared with
88% in the highest quartile, with shorter overall survival in patients
with lower serum selenium (6). Serum selenium remained predictive of outcome in a multivariate analysis that included clinical
variables as cofactors, as also reported by Deffuant et al. (7) in
cutaneous T-cell lymphoma patients. More recently, a dramatic
increase in the maximum tolerated dose and antitumor efficacy of
several cytotoxic agents has been reported when administered with
selenium as either selenomethionine or methylselenocysteine,
in both head and neck and lung cancer xenograft models (8, 9).
At higher concentrations, selenium compounds are cytotoxic to
tumor cells in vitro (10) and at high doses (15 mg/kg) are lethally
toxic in nude mice (11).3
The precise mechanism whereby selenium modulates cytotoxic
drug activity remains unclear, although modification of stress
response pathways is emerging as a possible explanation (12).
One of these stress response mediators, GADD153, is reported to
suppress nuclear factor-nB (NF-nB) activity, known to be elevated
in many cancer types. Furthermore, a number of reports have
associated increased NF-nB activity with decreased cytotoxic
drug activity and shown that NF-nB inhibition can sensitize cells
to cytotoxic agents (13–17). These data therefore provide a possible mechanism for the chemomodulatory activity of selenium
compounds.
Our earlier report (6) on the influence of selenium status on
treatment outcome in patients with non–Hodgkin’s lymphoma suggests that selenium supplementation at the time of chemotherapy
may be a useful treatment strategy in this disease. Although we
have recently described the single-agent activity of methylseleninic acid (MSA) in a panel of B-cell lymphoma cell lines (12),
there are no published data describing the activity of selenium in
combination with cytotoxic drugs using a lymphoma model. We
have therefore investigated the effects of selenium, as methylseleninic acid, in combination with standard antilymphoma agents in
B-cell lymphoma cell lines. As the drugs used were DNA-damaging

agents, the effects of MSA on the induction and repair of DNA
strand breaks were studied using the comet assay, and changes in
NF-nB activity after MSA exposure have been determined using a
NF-nB reporter construct.
Identifying intracellular selenium species that might be mediating the effects reported is important to both maximize any
interaction observed and to provide a potential molecular end
point for subsequent clinical trials with selenium compounds. We
have therefore also determined the intracellular selenium species
generated from MSA using novel mass spectrometry (MS)–based
methodologies, and identified the volatile and highly reactive
selenium species dimethylselenide and dimethyldiselenide in the
cell headspace after MSA exposure.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture. A panel of human B-cell lymphoma cell lines, a normal Bcell line and human peripheral mononuclear cells (PBMC) separated from
whole-blood samples, were used for this study. The DHL-4 cell line was
obtained from the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (kind gift from Dr.
Margaret Shipp). DoHH-2, CRL-2261, and SUD-4 cell lines were obtained
from The Centre for Haematology, Barts and the London School of
Medicine (kind gift from Professor Finbarr Cotter). DHL-5 cells and an EBVtransformed normal B-cell line (NC-NC) were obtained from DSMZ GmbH.
With the exception of DHL-5 cells (wild-type p53), all lymphoma cells had
heterozygous (DoHH2; ref. 18) or homozygous p53 mutations.
All cells were cultured in a standard cell humidifier in RPMI 1640 (SigmaAldrich Company, Ltd.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (heatinactivated) and penicillin/streptomycin (100 units/mL). For NF-nB studies,
cells were incubated with tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a; R&D Systems
Europe, Ltd.) by direct addition to the culture medium at a final
concentration of 10 ng/mL. BAY 11-7082, used as a specific NF-nB inhibitor,
was purchased from Merck Biosciences, Ltd.
Selenium compounds. MSA was obtained from PharmaSe, Inc., and
dissolved in sterile double-distilled water (ddH2O) as stock solutions of
10 mmol/L, which were stored at 80jC. Further dilutions were made in
RPMI 1640 cell culture medium before adding to cell suspensions.
Cell viability and EC50 values. Cell viability assays to determine the
activity of MSA and chemotherapeutic agents alone, and in combination,
were carried out by plating 5  103 cells/well into 96-well microtiter
plates. After drug incubation for 4 to 72 h, ViaCount Flex reagent (Guava
Technologies, Inc.) was added and cell viability was then determined using a
PCA-96 automated cell analyzer with Cytosoft analysis software (both from
Guava Technologies). EC50 values were calculated in GraphPad Prism
(GraphPad Software) using a sigmoidal dose-response model with variable
slope.
Alkaline single-cell gel electrophoresis assay. To investigate potential
DNA damage caused by increased selenium exposure alone, and in
combination with the established chemotherapy agents doxorubicin and
etoposide, comet assays were carried out according to Singh et al. (19), with
slight modifications. In brief, cells were plated in 24-well plates at a density
of 5  103/mL and treated with the drugs of interest for 24 to 48 h. The cell
pellets were then washed twice and resuspended in 50 AL PBS. Precooled
microscope glass slides were coated with 1% regular agarose. A lowmelting-point agarose (0.5%) suspension at 37jC was then added to the cell
suspension at a ratio of 16:1 and immediately transferred to a slide
precoated with regular agarose. The cells on the slides were lysed with icecold high-salt lysis buffer [2.5 mol/L NaCl, 100 mmol/L EDTA, 10 mmol/L
Tris (pH 10.0), 1% Triton X-100] for 1 h in the dark. Cells were then covered
in alkali solution [1 mmol/L EDTA, 300 mmol/L sodium hydroxide
(pH >13.0), 10 Ag/mL proteinase K] for 45 min followed by electrophoresis
[300 mmol/L NaCl, 100 mmol/L Tris (pH 9.0)] under low light at 20 V,
140 mA (1 V/cm) for 15 min at 4jC. The slides were neutralized using
1 mol/L ammonium acetate in ethanol and washed with ddH2O twice
before being dried overnight.

www.aacrjournals.org

The slides were rehydrated with ddH2O and stained with propidium
iodide solution (2.5 Ag/mL in ddH2O) for 15 min before rinsing with ddH2O
and drying in the dark. Comet images were visualized by using an inverted
fluorescent microscope (DIASHOT model TMD, Nikon) at 510 to 560 nm
excitation and 590 nm barrier filter at 320 magnification. Images were
analyzed from duplicate slides, 25 images per slide, using Komet assay
software (Kinetic Imaging).
Where not apparent from plotted data, statistical comparisons were
carried out using the Wilcoxon signed rank test for matched pairs (Minitab
v14). A P value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Transient transfection and measurement of NF-KB activity. Cells
were plated in 24-well plates at a density of 5  104/mL/well and were
transiently transfected with the reporter plasmid pNF-nB-Luc containing
binding sites for NF-nB: (TGGGGACTTTCCGC)5 upstream of the firefly
luciferase gene in a pLuc-MCS construct (Stratagene). The pRL-TK Renilla
luciferase plasmid (Promega) was cotransfected with the NF-nB plasmid as
an internal standard for equal transfection efficiency using Effectene
Transfection Reagent (Qiagen, Ltd.). At 24 h posttransfection, recombinant
TNF-a was added for 1 h followed by MSA for another 4 h. Cellular extracts
were then incubated with the Dual-Glo Luciferase Assay System substrate
(Promega) and luciferase activity was measured using a luminometer
(Polarstar Optima, BMG Labtech, Ltd.). NF-nB activity was expressed as the
percentage change of the activity of firefly luciferase normalized to the
Renilla luciferase signal obtained from untreated control cells.
Instrumentation for total intracellular selenium and generated
selenium species. Analysis using high-performance liquid chromatography
(HPLC) linked to an inductively coupled plasma MS (ICP-MS) were
performed with an Agilent Technologies 1100 HPLC system for chromatographic separations and an Agilent 7500i ICP-MS for element-specific
detection. Reversed-phase HPLC was performed on an Agilent Zorbax Rx-C8
connected to the microflow concentric nebulizer of the ICP-MS.
Chromatographic data were analyzed using Agilent Technologies ICP-MS
chromatographic software (G1824C Version C.01.00). For the HPLCelectrospray ionization (ESI) QTrapMS experiments, a 4000 QTRAP mass
spectrometer (ABI/MDS Sciex) and an Agilent Technologies 1100 HPLC
system were used. Data acquisition and processing were performed using
the ABI Analyst software version 1.4.1. The effluent from the reversed-phase
HPLC column was fed directly into the electrospray source. For optimum
chromatographic separation conditions and instrumental parameters for
online measurements with ICP-MS and electrospray–tandem MS (MS/MS),
see Supplementary Data.
Selenium standards, including sodium selenite, Se-DL-methionine
(SeMet), Se-methylselenocysteine (MSC), dimethylselenide, and dimethyldiselenide were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich unless stated otherwise. The
standards of L-g-glutamyl-Se-methylseleno-L-cysteine and MSA were
purchased from PharmaSe. For the preparation of SeMet stock solutions,
0.1 mol/L hydrochloric acid was used; all other standards were diluted in
ultrapure water and kept at 4jC in the dark.
A standard solution of 10 Ag/kg of Se in methanol-water-0.1% formic acid
was prepared for the daily optimization of the ICP-MS parameters.
Total Se determination by online flow injection analysis with ICPMS. Quantification of total Se in cell extracts was performed by flow injection analysis combined online with ICP-MS detection. Cellular extracts
were injected in a stream of ultrapure water as the sample carrier. For
calibration, standard addition at three concentration levels, monitoring
the isotope 82Se, was used. Rhodium was used as the internal standard.
An integration time per mass of 300 ms was selected for obtaining the best
signal-to-noise ratio.
Quantification of intracellular Se species by reversed-phase HPLCICP-MS. Cell extracts were analyzed by reversed-phase HPLC-ICP-MS using
a water-methanol (98+2, v/v) mixture containing 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic
acid (TFA) as the mobile phase. For chromatographic and ICP-MS
conditions, see Supplementary Data. Calibration was carried out by the
standard addition technique at three concentration levels, using peak area
measurements of the chromatographic signals by monitoring the 82Se
signal. The standard solution used for calibration was characterized for its
total Se content by ICP-MS.

Verification of the presence of MSC by HPLC-ESI MS/MS. For
identification of the Se peaks detected by HPLC-ICP-MS, cell extracts were
injected onto the reversed-phase column. The separation and elution of the
different Se species were achieved using the same chromatographic column
as for the ICP-MS analysis (see Supplementary Data) but with a mobile
phase containing formic acid, which is, unlike TFA, compatible with ESI.
Mass spectra were recorded over a m/z range of 50 to 1,000. For Se
standards, product ion spectra were acquired in the collision-induced
dissociation mode. MS/MS spectra for Se standards and Se species in the
cell extracts were acquired in the selected reaction monitoring mode. The
most abundant transitions m/z 184 > m/z 167 (loss of OH) and m/z 184 >
m/z 95 ( formation of the ion fragment SeCH+3) for MSC and m/z 198 > m/z
181 (loss of OH), and m/z 198 > m/z 109 ( formation of the ion fragment
CH3SeCH+2) for SeMet were monitored.
Solid-phase microextraction capture of volatile Se compounds. To
capture volatile selenium species, a 75 Am Carboxen polydimethylsiloxane
solid-phase microextraction (SPME) fiber (Supelco) was placed in the
headspace above DHL-4 cells in culture before and after MSA treatment.
The fiber was then held in the inlet liner of the gas chromatogram for the
duration of the complete chromatographic run. Sampling of Se volatile
compounds from the headspace of a standard mixture solution containing
dimethylselenide and dimethyldiselenide was performed using the same
procedure.
Identification of volatile Se species by gas chromatography time-offlight MS. Gas chromatography-time-of flight MS (GC-TOFMS) measurements were performed using an Agilent 6890 GC coupled to the Leco
Pegasus III TOFMS (Leco). A HP Ultra2 column was used for separation of
the volatile species. TOF mass calibration was performed using perfluorotributylamine. A splitless injection mode was used with helium as the
carrier gas. Mass spectra were recorded over a m/z range of 50 to 400. Data
acquisition and processing were performed using the LECO ChromaTOF
software version 2.25 (optimized for Pegasus).

Results
Sensitivity of malignant and normal B-cell lines to MSA. The
effect of MSA was studied in lymphoma and normal B-cell lines
and in human PBMCs. The lymphoma cell lines differed in their
sensitivity to MSA as shown in Fig. 1A. CRL-2261, SUD-4, and DHL5 cell lines were the most sensitive to MSA with EC50 values of
4.7 Amol/L [95% confidence interval (95% CI), 3.3–6.8], 6.5 Amol/L
(95% CI, 5.3–7.9), and 2.3 Amol/L (95% CI, 1.8–2.9), respectively,
after a 72-h exposure. DHL-4 and DoHH-2 cells were considerably
less sensitive, with EC50 values of 373 Amol/L (95% CI, 198.1–703.1)
and 168.6 Amol/L (95% CI, 110.7–256.6), respectively. The cell line
panel was therefore grouped into MSA-sensitive and MSA-resistant
cell lines for further experiments. The normal B-cell line (NC-NC)
and PBMCs were also less sensitive to MSA with EC50 values of
27 Amol/L (95% CI, 22.4–32.5) and 84.2 Amol/L (95% CI, 11.0–641.0),
respectively (Fig. 1B).
Two malignant B-cell lines (one sensitive and one resistant) were
further studied using a methylcellulose colony formation assay
system. After a 14-day incubation period, a reduction in colonies
was observed in MSA-treated cells at 5 and 10 Amol/L MSA for the
SUD-4 cell line and at 100 and 200 Amol/L MSA for DHL-4 cells,
whereas untreated control cells showed clear colony formation
(data not shown).
Enhanced efficacy of standard chemotherapy when combined with MSA. Cell lines were incubated simultaneously for
48 h with nontoxic or minimally toxic concentrations of MSA and
specific cytotoxic drugs used to treat B-cell lymphomas. In SUD-4
cells, representing a MSA-sensitive cell line, the cytotoxicity of
doxorubicin alone could be increased from 21% (F3.2) cell kill at
75 nmol/L to 49% (F4.9) after 48 h when combined with low

B-cell lines after an exposure time of 72 h (A ), and normal B-cells for 24 and

results were analyzed using a sigmoidal dose-response model with variable
slope to generate EC50 values (Graphpad Prism 3.03).

(nontoxic) concentrations of MSA (0.5 Amol/L), resulting in a clear
synergistic effect (Fig. 2A). Synergy was also observed when
etoposide was combined with 0.5 Amol/L MSA, with an increase in
cell kill from 32% (F1.3) with 10 Amol/L etoposide alone to 60%
(F3.6) when combined with MSA. The activity of 1 Amol/L
4-hydroxycyclophosphamide (the active form of cyclophosphamide) was increased from 19% (F0.9) when used alone to 50%
(F1.6) in the presence of 0.5 Amol/L MSA (Fig. 2A). Similar effects
were observed in the selenium-resistant DHL-4 cell line. For
doxorubicin (225 nmol/L), the cytotoxic activity was increased
from 8% (F3.4) alone to 44% (F17.3) when combined with MSA
(10 Amol/L; Fig. 2B), for etoposide from 4% (F1.4) to 22% (F1.0),
and for 4-hydroxycyclophosphamide from 7% (F1.5) to 22% (F3.1).
Only additive effects were observed when MSA was added to
melphalan or 1-h-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine in these cell lines.
The best enhancement of cytotoxic drug activity was obtained with
simultaneous exposures with MSA rather than sequential treatments (data not shown).
The effect of MSA on the generation of DNA damage. To
investigate the genotoxic activity of selenium alone and its effects
on DNA single-strand breaks generated by doxorubicin, we used an
alkaline version of the comet assay. This is a sensitive method for
the quantitative detection of low levels of DNA damage and, after
a drug-free recovery period, DNA repair. A MSA-sensitive (SUD-4)
and a more MSA-resistant (DHL-4) B-cell line were used for these
studies. MSA alone induced a concentration-dependent increase in

in DHL-4 cells, with a 1.2-fold increase in comet tail DNA with

10 Amol/L MSA and a 2.2-fold increase with 200 Amol/L MSA
(Fig. 3B). Both cell lines showed the expected increase in DNA
damage with doxorubicin over the 24-h exposure period. Doxorubicin-induced DNA damage was concentration dependent between
37.5 and 750 nmol/L, and showed a clear relationship with cell

viability, in SUD-4 cells. In DHL-4 cells, this relationship was more
complex, with a concentration-dependent increase in DNA damage
occurring at lower concentrations than required for cell kill (data
not shown).
The combination of doxorubicin with MSA resulted in an
increase in DNA damage, but this was not more than additive, as
shown in Fig. 3, and was below the level at which maximal DNA
damage was achieved with doxorubicin alone in both cell lines.
Statistical analysis using the Wilcoxon signed rank test showed that
the amount of DNA damage from the combination was greater
than that obtained with doxorubicin alone (Fig. 3A and B; P <
0.0001 for both cell lines). However, for the combinations, the
difference between the measured and expected (the sum of each
agent used singly) DNA damage was not statistically significant
(SUD-4 cells, P = 0.101; DHL-4 cells, P = 0.213).
The addition of MSA to doxorubicin resulted in no change in the
amount of DNA repair after a 4-h recovery period compared with
doxorubicin alone.
Inhibition of NF-KB activity in MSA-treated B-cell lymphoma cells. As changes in DNA damage did not fully explain the
synergistic effects in cell death obtained in the combination
experiments, we studied the NF-nB pathway, known to be involved
in apoptosis and chemosensitivity, by measuring TNF-a–induced
NF-nB activity in DHL-4 cells. The transcriptional activity of NF-nB
after 5-h exposure to MSA was decreased in a concentrationdependent manner, down to 52% (F11) activity at 5 Amol/L MSA
and 33% (F11) at 10 Amol/L MSA (Fig. 4). The ability of MSA
to reduce NF-nB activity was also seen in other B-cell lines (e.g.,
DoHH-2; data not shown). This reduction was similar to that seen
with the specific NF-nB inhibitor, BAY 11-7082, where activity
was decreased to 67% (F6) at 1 Amol/L and 40% (F1) at 3 Amol/L
BAY 11.
Do synergistic effects of chemotherapeutic agents with MSA
occur due to NF-KB inhibition? We next investigated whether the
synergistic activity observed when MSA was combined with
chemotherapy was attributable to the MSA-induced decrease in
NF-nB activity. The down-regulation of NF-nB activity with the
inhibitor BAY 11-7082 significantly increased the cytotoxic activity
of etoposide and doxorubicin in both cell lines studied, as shown
for the MSA-sensitive cell line SUD-4 (Fig. 2C) and a MSA-resistant
cell line DHL-4 (Fig. 2D). In SUD-4 cells, the cell kill with
doxorubicin and BAY 11-7082 in combination was 51% (F8.5)
compared with 23% (F3.3) with doxorubicin alone, whereas for
etoposide BAY 11-7082 increased cell kill from 34% (F1.3) to 54%

(F6.4). Again, similar effects were seen in the more resistant cell
line, DHL-4, in which 1 Amol/L BAY 11-7082 enhanced the cell
death from 12% (F3.4) with doxorubicin alone to 51% (F3.7) with
BAY 11-7082, and from 7% (F1.4) with etoposide alone to 39%
(F3.0) with BAY 11-7082 (Fig. 2D).
Cytotoxic drugs alone induced NF-nB activity, markedly so in the
case of etoposide, which resulted in a 2.7-fold increase in activity.
However, in the presence of 10 Amol/L MSA, NF-nB continued
to show reduced activity even in co-incubations with 10 Amol/L
etoposide (72.9% of control) or 375 nmol/L doxorubicin (66.2% of
control).
Intracellular MSA uptake and the resulting selenium levels
in B-cell lymphoma cells. A novel LC-ICP-MS method showed
that B-cell lymphoma cell lines differed in their basal selenium
levels. In CRL-2261 cells, a MSA-sensitive cell line, the baseline
selenium content was 55 ng/mL, considerably higher than that
found in the two MSA-resistant cell lines DHL-4 (16 ng/mL) and
DoHH-2 (18 ng/mL).
After 4-h exposure to MSA, selenium concentrations increased in
the DHL-4 cell line, notably by 25-fold at 400 Amol/L MSA
exposure. In DoHH-2 cells, there was a 4-fold change in selenium
content after a longer exposure time of 24 h (data not shown). In
contrast, the MSA-sensitive cell line CRL-2261, with high baseline
selenium content, showed only a small change in intracellular
selenium after 4 h at MSA concentrations up to 50 Amol/L, but
returned to pretreatment levels during a 24-h exposure.
Intracellular selenium metabolites generated after MSA
exposure in B-cell lymphoma cells. To investigate further the
cellular metabolites generated by MSA, a method capable of
detecting selenium species in cell extracts was developed using
reversed-phase HPLC-ICP-MS analysis. We first determined selenium species in cells exposed to 200 and 400 Amol/L MSA for 4 h, the
time point showing the highest intracellular uptake, in the DHL-4
cell line. Two main peaks were detected, with retention times of
4.6 and 9.9 min, identified as MSC and SeMet, with relative Se
distribution (as total Se areas of eluted peaks) of 70% (F5) and 20%
(F2), respectively. The time course of selenium species generation
was then investigated further, as shown in Fig. 5A. None of the
parent compound MSA was detected intracellularly in any sample
during the 4-h incubation period, even after 10 min. MSC
concentration was maximal after 30 min at 4,666 ppm (data not
shown) and decreased thereafter to 1,232 ppm after 2 h (Fig. 5A).
The second detected selenium metabolite, SeMet, was formed

appearance of a second metabolite identified as dimethylselenide
with a retention time of 0.9 min. Neither MSA nor cells alone
in cell culture medium showed any peaks at these elution times,
indicating that the formation of the volatile selenium species
occurred intracellularly and was time dependently formed in the
first few minutes of MSA exposure. The presence of these two
main metabolites was confirmed by oven cooling-GC-TOFMS
and showed exactly the same masses compared with library
data.

Ion-pair reversed-phase HPLC-ESI-MS/MS analysis to confirm the intracellular species detected. To verify the presence
of MSC as the main intracellular selenium species after MSA
exposure in DHL-4 cells, ion-pair reversed-phase HPLC with ESIMS/MS in selected reaction monitoring mode was used. Specific
transitions from the precursor ion (m/z 184) to product ions
with m/z of 95 (SeCH+3) and 167 (loss of OH), also observed in
the standard, were monitored (Fig. 6). In cells exposed to MSA
(200 Amol/L) for 30 min, both transitions were detected at the
two retention times of MSC (Fig. 6C), confirming the presence of
MSC as the major intracellular selenium species after exposure to
MSA (Fig. 6D).

Discussion
The emerging role of selenium as a potential chemomodulatory
agent led us to explore the supplementation effect of MSA when
combined with established cytotoxic drugs, with the aim of
improving the treatment of lymphoid malignancies. First attempts
have been made to increase the therapeutic efficacy of standard
cytotoxic drugs using selenium compounds (20, 21). The present
study results confirmed that MSA reduces cell viability in a panel
of B-cell lymphoma cell lines (10), was less cytotoxic to normal
B-cells, and importantly at low concentration showed synergistic
activity when combined with cytotoxic drugs used in the treatment
of lymphomas. This makes MSA, or similar compounds that rapidly
generate reactive selenium species such as MSC, good candidates
for further studies in cancer therapy.
The synergistic effects on cell kill observed with three of the five
chemotherapeutic agents when combined with nontoxic MSA con-

centrations showed that the chemosensitization was drug specific
but not cell line restricted. Even chemotherapy-resistant cell lines,
such as DHL-4, were sensitized to cytotoxic drugs when combined
with MSA, suggesting that selenium supplementation could modify
drug sensitivity in resistant B-cell lymphomas. Similar results have
been reported with other selenium compounds such as MSC and
SeMet as selective modulators of anticancer agents in in vivo
models (11). We are currently evaluating whether this approach
translates to the clinic in a phase 1/2 trial in which selenium is
given with chemotherapy.
To explore the mechanisms by which the synergistic effects seen
might be mediated, we first addressed whether the increased apoptosis observed was due to MSA-induced changes in DNA damage,
or DNA damage repair, resulting from cytotoxic drug exposure.
MSA and the DNA-damaging agent doxorubicin, either alone or
in combination, induced permanent DNA damage (no DNA repair
was seen after a 4 h drug-free period). There was a linear relationship between doxorubicin-induced DNA strand breaks and
cell viability in SUD-4 cells, whereas in the MSA-resistant cell line,
DHL-4, a concentration-dependent increase in DNA damage was
observed at lower doxorubicin concentrations than those required
to induce cell kill, suggesting that the resistance to cytotoxic drugs
observed in this cell line is in the apoptotic response to DNA
damage. In both cell lines, the combination of MSA with
doxorubicin resulted only in additive DNA damage, indicating that
the increased cell kill observed was not due to enhanced DNA
damage alone.
We next investigated whether the NF-nB pathway might be
targeted by MSA. NF-nB is constitutively up-regulated in many
cancers, including lymphomas, and targeting NF-nB using the

spectrum for the product ions generated from MSC (m/z 184) shown in B. A representative chromatogram is shown in the right panel for a MSC standard (C ) and cell
extracts of human B cells (D ), with m/z transitions of 184/95 and 184/167, to verify the presence of MSC as the main intracellular species detected after 30-min
exposure to MSA.

proteasome inhibitor velcade has shown clinical activity in this
setting (22). NF-nB is also involved in the cellular response to
oxidative stress and plays a role in chemosensitivity (23, 24). MSA
had a marked effect on this pathway, down-regulating NF-nB
activity by 50% to 70% after a short exposure time of 5 h. We
confirmed that inhibiting NF-nB increased sensitivity to chemotherapeutic drugs by conducting combination experiments with
the same drugs and the specific NF-nB inhibitor BAY 11-7082,
known to block the release and translocation of NF-nB into the
nucleus followed by further activation of antiapoptotic genes,
including cIAP-2, Bcl-2, Bcl-XL (25, 26), and also Cox-2 and cyclin D1
(27–29).
A decrease in NF-nB activity is reported to overcome chemoresistance in many malignancies (30). As reduced NF-nB activity
was observed in both MSA-sensitive and MSA-resistant cells, it is
likely that the synergistic effects observed with drug combinations
can be explained, at least partly, by changes in this pathway after
MSA exposure, resulting in the down-regulation of cell survival
pathways. Similar chemosensitization has been shown with other
agents that target NF-nB (15), including the use of specific InK
inhibitors to overcome resistance to imatinib (31).
As MSA was shown to generate concentration-dependent DNA
damage and a reduction in NF-nB activity, we next sought to
identify the selenium species that might be mediating this cellular
stress, using novel LC-ICP-MS and GC-TOFMS approaches. Our
first observation was that the basal levels of intracellular selenium
differed from cell line to cell line, despite maintaining these cells in
the same culture conditions. Cell lines with low basal selenium
levels showed a marked increase in total selenium after MSA
exposure (by 5- to 25-fold), suggesting that differences in
intracellular saturation levels for selenium differ between cell lines.
These findings are likely to have clinical relevance in that even in
the same disease, basal tumor selenium levels, and the ability to
take up selenium, may vary considerably.
The two main selenium species identified, MSC and SeMet, were
detected after only 10-min exposure, making the rapid intracellular
conversion of MSA to other species very clear. The main compound
generated, MSC, was verified by a separate organic MS method
involving HPLC-ESI MS/MS, although SeMet was not detectable
using this method due either to its reduced sensitivity or to a
matrix-induced interference.
Some reports hypothesize that MSC would be generated by MSA
via methylselenol, before further reduction to selenite and selenol
(32). As these selenium species are very volatile, they would be

expected to have a very short half-life. During incubation experiments with MSA, we did detect the characteristic ‘‘bad smell,’’
which is described by many others when cells are forming
methylselenol. We were able to trap such volatile selenium
metabolites, and/or their methylation products, in the headspace
of malignant B cells during MSA exposure using SPME fibers with
subsequent compound determination by GC-ICP-MS (33). The two
main detected species, namely dimethylselenide and dimethyldiselenide, were almost undetectable in untreated cells, but showed a
massive increase after just 10 to 20 min of exposure to MSA. These
two active metabolites of selenol are the most potent biologically
active forms of selenium (5).
Taken together, the present study suggests a cascade in the rapid
generation of active forms of selenium in human B cells after
exposure to MSA: MSA!MSC!SeMet!g-glutamyl and to dimethylselenide and dimethyldiselenide as volatile components. The
appearance of these reactive species is associated with the generation of DNA damage, also reported by others using methylated
selenium species (34), and a decrease in the transcriptional activity
of NF-nB. This series of events, triggered by low concentrations
of selenium, results in the observed synergistic effects in cell kill.
Importantly, this synergistic interaction was achieved at MSA concentrations that had little, if any, effect on the viability of normal B
cells.
MSA, or related compounds such as MSC, seem to be excellent
candidates for use as novel chemosensitizing agents in the clinic.
Additionally, the availability of the methods described for
measuring selenium species in intracellular and volatile forms will
be an important tool for monitoring changes in selenium status in
a planned clinical trial.
