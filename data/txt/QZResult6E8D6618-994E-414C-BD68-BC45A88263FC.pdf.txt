Abstract:

The p21-activated kinases (PAKs) are central players in growth factor signaling
networks and morphogenetic processes that control proliferation, cell polarity,
invasion and actin cytoskeleton organization. This raises the possibility that
interfering with PAK activity may produce significant anti-tumor activity. In this
perspective, we summarize recent data concerning the contribution of the PAK family
member, PAK1, in growth factor signaling and tumorigenesis. We further discuss
mechanisms by which inhibition of PAK1 can arrest tumor growth and promote cell
apoptosis, and the types of cancers in which PAK1 inhibition may hold promise.

PAK1 signaling in NSCLC

Elevated expression and/or nuclear localization of PAK1
were associated with resistance to tamoxifen therapy [9],
possibly occurring as a result of direct phosphorylation
and ligand-independent transactivation of estrogen
receptor-α by PAK1 [10]. Functional studies have
also implicated PAK1 in cell transformation [11], and
transgenic overexpression of PAK1 in the mammary
gland promotes the formation of tumors and preneoplastic
lesions in animal models, albeit with a long latency [12].
These findings indicate that PAK1 may contribute to
tumorigenesis in some disease contexts [13,14].
To determine the possible extent of PAK1
dysregulation across human cancers, we determined
PAK1 protein expression and subcellular localization
via immunohistochemical (IHC) staining of primary
human tissue microarrays from several tumor indications,
including breast, lung, and head and neck cancers [15].
Nearly two-thirds of squamous NSCLC samples in our
panel were positive for PAK1 protein expression and
52% (n=67) of all cases showed staining of moderate or
strong intensity in the malignant cells. In comparison,
adjacent normal lung tissue did not express appreciable
protein levels of PAK1. Nuclear localization of PAK1
was also evident in a significant proportion of squamous
NSCLC tumors (25%) and it has been shown that nuclear

PAK serine/threonine protein kinases are subdivided
into two groups, PAK1-3 (group I) and PAK4-6 (group
II), based on sequence similarities and an autoinhibitory
domain which is present in group I, but not group II PAK
proteins [1,2]. The group I PAKs share a number of other
conserved structural characteristics, such as a p21-binding
domain (PBD), a serine/threonine kinase domain, an
acidic region and multiple proline-rich regions that serve
as binding sites for SH3 domain-containing proteins. As
a major downstream effector of the Rho family small
GTPases Cdc42 and Rac1, PAK1 plays a fundamental
role in controlling cell motility by linking a variety of
extracellular signals to changes in actin cytoskeleton
organization, cell shape and adhesion dynamics (Figure
1) [3,4,5].
PAK1 is the most well characterized family
member and is widely expressed in a variety of normal
tissues [1]. PAK1 expression is significantly increased
in ovarian, breast and bladder cancers [6,7,8]. In luminal
breast cancer, the expression and localization of PAK1
protein was recently assessed in primary tumors from
403 premenopausal patients that were randomized to
two years of adjuvant tamoxifen or no treatment [9].

import of PAK1 can play a critical role in vertebrate cell
biology [16]. Supporting evidence that PAK1 expression
is elevated in squamous NSCLC was also obtained by
analyzing PAK1 mRNA expression in a distinct set of
laser-capture microdissected lung tissues (p < 0.0001).
We subsequently examined the effect of RNAimediated knockdown of PAK1 in a panel of lung cancer
cell lines to clarify the contribution of PAK1 towards
tumor cell growth and survival. Transient knockdown
of PAK1 and PAK2 together resulted in a 2.5- to 8-fold
reduction in [3H]-thymidine incorporation of multiple
squamous NSCLC lines when compared with control cells
(p<0.0001). In addition, we made use of a doxycyclineinducible short-hairpin RNA (shRNA) system [17,18] to
study PAK1 loss-of-function effects. Tightly regulated
Dox-mediated knockdown of PAK1 was observed in
NSCLC cells and tumor xenografts. Inhibition of PAK1
resulted in accumulation of cells in the G1 phase of
the cell cycle, altered levels of E2F and p27Kip1 (which
play multifaceted roles in regulation of G0 to S phase
transitions of the cell cycle), and inhibition of in vivo
tumor growth [19,20]. Furthermore, PAK1 knockdown
substantially decreased tumor cell proliferation (imaged

by immunofluorescence staining of Ki-67 positive nuclei),
migration and actin dynamics induced by hepatocyte
growth factor (HGF) treatment (Figure 2). Amplification
or over-expression of c-MET (the receptor for HGF) is
a known genetic aberration and therapeutic target in
squamous NSCLC [21,22] and PAK1 may be a key
effector for HGF/c-MET signaling in cancer. Together,
these findings demonstrate that PAK1 is important for
proliferation of a subset of squamous lung cancers in vitro
and in vivo, and support the possibility that interfering
with PAK1 activity could have therapeutic efficacy in this
indication.

Implications for treatment of
squamous lung carcinoma
Primary lung cancer is a heterogeneous disease both
genetically and histologically. It can be subdivided into
small cell lung cancer (accounting for approximately 20%)
[23,24], which has a neuroendocrine phenotype, and nonsmall cell lung cancer, which comprises adenocarcinomas,
squamous carcinomas and more rare subtypes. Squamous
lung carcinoma is a prevalent subtype, accounting for

regimen [29]. While erlotinib is approved for use in
unselected patients, there is evidence that erlotinib
and a related drug, gefitinib, show greater activity and
efficacy in cancers that harbour specific mutations in
EGFR and are wildtype for KRAS, an oncogene that
transduces growth promoting signals downstream of
EGFR [30]. EGFR mutations are very frequent in lung
adenocarcinomas (40%), but are infrequent (0-5%) in
squamous cell carcinomas of the lung [31,32]. Moreover,
other mutations affecting genes that impinge on the EGFR/
RAS pathway are relatively infrequent (3% PI3KCA, 6%
KRAS, 2% BRAF and 10% PTEN) [31]. Thus, squamous
lung carcinoma represents an unmet medical need with a
poor prognosis and PAK inhibitors could be tested in this
indication.

33% of primary lung cancers in non-smokers and 42% in
smokers [23,24]. Historically, differences in the prognosis
and sensitivity to chemotherapy of adenocarcinomas
and squamous carcinomas (following correction for
stage and other confounding variables) were considered
insufficient to warrant different treatment. First line
treatment with one of four combination chemotherapy
regimens was once the standard of care, irrespective of a
tumour’s histology or genetic makeup, but despite therapy
two-year survival is only 11% [25]. However, since that
time several targeted therapies have been approved for
NSCLC. Bevacizumab, an antibody to VEGF that targets
tumour blood vessels, has shown improvements in overall
and/or progression-free survival when combined with
cytotoxic chemotherapy [26,27]. However, the use of
bevacizumab specifically excludes squamous NSCLC due
to haemoptysis [28]. Erlotinib is a small molecular tyrosine
kinase inhibitor against epidermal growth factor receptor
(EGFR) that is approved as monotherapy for maintenance
treatment following platinum-based chemotherapy or as
monotherapy following the failure of ≥1 chemotherapy

and induction of programmed cell death were confirmed

additional NSCLC cell lines. Our recent published work
demonstrates a fundamental role for PAK1 in NSCLC
biology and provides support for PAK1 as a therapeutic
target in this tumor indication.

was absent in normal breast epithelial cells, but genomic
amplification was prevalent in luminal subtype tumors
and elevated cytoplasmic protein expression was observed
across 39% of primary adenocarcinomas. Consistent with
the evolutionarily conserved role for PAK1 in regulating
cell motility, high PAK1 expression was associated with
lymph node invasion and occurred more frequently in nodal
metastases compared to primary tumors. It is interesting
that the frequency of dysregulated expression of PAK1
was more frequent than would be predicted by genomic
amplification alone and additional regulatory mechanisms
that may increase PAK1 expression in breast cancer, such
as via microRNA genes [33], remain to be fully explored.
Analysis of MDA-MB-175, HCC1500 and MDA-MB134IV cell lines with PAK1 genomic copy number gain
revealed exquisite dependence on PAK1 expression and
activity for cell survival [15]. The pro-survival function
of PAK1 in breast cancers might be another contributing
factor to the association of elevated PAK1 expression
and reduced clinical benefit in patients treated with
tamoxifen [9]. Taken together, our identification of PAK1
as an “Achilles’ heel” for a subpopulation of breast
cancer provides evidence of oncogene addiction [34]
and a rationale for PAK1-directed therapy in this disease
indication.

Conclusions
In summary, recent work on the PAK family
of kinases has focused on the role of these proteins
in cellular functions relevant to tumor initiation and
maintenance, namely cell proliferation and survival
signaling [13,37,38,39]. We assessed the role of
PAK1 in a large panel of human tumors (via high
resolution, single-nucleotide polymorphism arrays and
immunohistochemical staining) and in vivo tumor models
(via inducible RNA interference) and showed that PAK1
inhibition resulted in improved anti-tumor efficacy [15].
It will be of great interest to expand on these efficacy
experiments by utilizing genetically engineered mouse
models to continue evaluating the therapeutic benefit of
PAK1 inhibition [40,41]. PAK1 inhibition also promoted
tumor cell apoptosis as either single-agent treatment (in
the context of tumor cells with focal genomic amplification
of PAK1) or as combination therapy with several targeted
agents (in squamous cell carcinomas). It will be important
to more thoroughly characterize PAK1 effector signaling
and possible molecular mechanisms for regulation of
cell survival in squamous NSCLC. For instance, PAK1
signaling in squamous NSCLC cells was associated
with an accumulation of the anti-apoptotic BCL2 family
member, myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1), and suggests
a combination with BCL2 inhibitors such as Navitoclax/
ABT-263 [42]. Nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) subunits
were also differentially phosphorylated following PAK1
inhibition in multiple squamous NSCLC cell lines and this
pathway may contribute to transformation of lung cancer
cells [43,44]. Taken together, we describe evidence for
dysregulation of PAK1 in breast and squamous NSCLC
tumors and a role for PAK1 in cellular survival and
proliferation in these indications.

Rational therapeutic strategies
for
combining
with
PAK1
inhibition
Despite the exquisite sensitivity of the breast
cancer cell lines harboring genomic copy gains to PAK1
knockdown, inhibition of PAK1 did not generally increase
apoptosis of NSCLC cells and xenograft models. We
therefore hypothesized that PAK1 inhibition may synergize
with other molecularly targeted agents to augment
killing of tumor cells. We also reasoned that testing the
combination of PAK1 inhibition plus compounds of
known cellular mechanism would aid in understanding
the cellular function of PAK1 in NSCLC cells as well as in
rationally designing effective combination regimens that
could be readily translated into the clinic. Hence, a cellular
viability screen was performed using shPAK1 isogenic
cells and a panel of 200 small molecule compounds that
included oncology drugs approved by the FDA, signaling
pathway inhibitors and DNA damaging agents. Among the
tested compounds, antagonists of inhibitor of apoptosis
proteins (IAP), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR),
MAPK/ERK kinase-1/2 (MEK1/2) and Src family kinases
displayed enhanced efficacy in the context of combined
PAK1 knockdown [15]. A number of antagonists have
been described to disrupt the association of IAP with the
second mitochondrial activator of caspases (SMAC) and
activated caspase-9 [35,36] and this protein family was
selected for follow-up studies. Consistent with the small
molecule screening data, strong combinatorial activity
