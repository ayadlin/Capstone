BACKGROUND: The phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin pathway plays a critical role in
the pathogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We performed a single-arm, phase 1/2 study of everolimus in
patients with advanced HCC. METHODS: Patients with histologically confirmed measurable advanced HCC, 0-2 prior
regimens, and adequate hematologic, hepatic, and renal functions received everolimus at 5 mg/day or 10 mg/day
orally (6 weeks/cycle). The primary end points were determination of a safe dosage of everolimus (phase 1) and progression-free survival (PFS) at 24 weeks (phase 2). RESULTS: Twenty-eight patients were enrolled and evaluable for
efficacy and toxicity. No dose-limiting toxicities were observed at the 5 mg/day (n ¼ 3) or 10 mg/day (n ¼ 6) dosage
level in phase 1. Twenty-five patients received everolimus at 10 mg/day. Grade 3-4 adverse events included lymphopenia (n ¼ 3), aspartate transaminase (n ¼ 3), hyponatremia (n ¼ 2), and 1 patient each with anemia, alanine transaminase, hyperglycemia, proteinuria, rash, and hypoxia. One patient (4%) had partial response (95% confidence interval
[CI], 0.9%-19.6%). The median PFS and overall survival were 3.8 months (95% CI, 2.1-4.6) and 8.4 months (95% CI,
3.9-21.1), respectively. The estimated PFS rate at 24 weeks was 28.6% (95% CI, 7.9%-49.3%). CONCLUSION: Everolimus was well tolerated in patients with advanced HCC, and 10 mg/day was defined as the phase 2 dosage. Although
the study did not proceed to the second stage of phase 2, preliminary antitumor activity was observed with everoliC 2011

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the sixth most common cancer and the third most common cause of cancerrelated mortality worldwide.1 After decades of research, 2 randomized trials demonstrated that sorafenib improved survival in patients with advanced HCC and established sorafenib as a standard first-line treatment for advanced HCC.2,3
Other molecularly targeted agents are under clinical development4; however, most of these agents also target angiogenesis
pathways. Therefore, novel agents that inhibit other hepatocarcinogenesis pathways are urgently needed.
Increasing evidence supports an important role for the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt/mammalian target of
rapamycin (mTOR) pathway and potential for inhibiting mTOR as a therapeutic strategy in HCC.5 Aberrant mTOR signaling as reflected by upstream activation through epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor is well documented, and mutations in p110alpha (PIK3CA) have been reported in HCC.6 Hepatitis B virus
X-proteins activate the PI3K pathway by modulating phosphorylation of Akt.7 The mTOR pathway is involved in production of proangiogenic factors, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF); therefore, inhibition of the
mTOR pathway may have antiangiogenic activity in HCC.8 Preclinical data have demonstrated that mTOR inhibitors
were effective in inhibiting cell growth and tumor vascularity in HCC cell lines and HCC tumor models.8,9 HCC can be
induced in a transgenic hepatocyte-specific phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN)-deficient mouse model.10 Phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6 kinase (p-RPS6) downstream of PI3K/mTOR is present in approximately 50% of HCC

cases. Chromosomal gains in the mTOR-associated protein RICTOR and p-RPS6–positive staining correlate
with HCC recurrence following surgical resection.11
To evaluate whether inhibition of the PI3K/Akt/
mTOR pathway is safe and effective in patients with
advanced HCC, we initiated a phase 1/2 study of everolimus, an oral small-molecule serine-threonine kinase inhibitor of mTOR, in patients with advanced HCC.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Population
The trial was approved by the institutional review board
at the Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center (Boston,
Mass). All patients provided written informed consent
before study participation.
Eligibility criteria were as follows: histologically proven, measurable, locally advanced, or metastatic HCC; no
more than 2 prior chemotherapeutic and biologic regimens; prior chemoembolization therapy (only if performed >4 weeks before study entry and measurable
disease outside of the chemoembolization field was present); age 18 years; Eastern Cooperative Oncology
Group performance status of 0-2; Cancer of the Liver Italian Program score 3; and adequate bone marrow, renal,
and hepatic function (absolute neutrophil count 1000/
lL, hemoglobin level 9 g/dL, platelet count 75,000/
lL, serum creatinine level 2.0 mg/dL, total bilirubin
level <3.0 mg/dL, and aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase levels 7 times the upper limit of
normal).
Exclusion criteria were as follows: concurrent malignancies; significant medical comorbidities, including
severely impaired lung function and uncontrolled diabetes; significant cardiovascular disease, including symptomatic congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction 6
months before study treatment, serious uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia, and unstable angina; chronic use of systemic steroids or immunosuppressive therapy; active
bleeding; proteinuria at baseline (>2 g/day); pregnancy or
lactation; brain metastases; impairment of gastrointestinal
function or gastrointestinal disease that may alter the
absorption of everolimus; or prior use of mTOR
inhibitors.
Study Treatment
Eligible patients received everolimus continuously daily
by mouth until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity,
or withdrawal of consent. Six weeks of the study drug

were considered 1 cycle of treatment. The phase 1 stage of
the study used the conventional 3þ3 design. The starting
dosage of everolimus was 5 mg/day. The planned escalated dosage level was 10 mg/day and the de-escalated dosage level was 5 mg every other day.
Everolimus was interrupted and supportive management instituted for grade 3-4 hematologic or grade 3 nonhematologic toxicities. Everolimus was reinitiated with a
50% dosage reduction if resolution of the toxicity to less
than grade 2 occurred within 14 days; otherwise, treatment was discontinued. Treatment was also discontinued
for grade 4 nonhematologic toxicity, grade 2 or higher
pneumonitis, or continued toxicity after reinstitution of
everolimus at 5 mg every other day. Dose-limiting toxicity
(DLT) likely attributed to everolimus was evaluated during the first cycle (42 days). DLT was defined as any grade
4 neutropenia or thrombocytopenia; any grade 3 or higher
nonhematologic toxicity, excluding alopecia, nausea, and
vomiting (not controlled by standard antiemetic therapy);
grade 3 or higher diarrhea requiring hospitalization or
lasting >24 hours despite aggressive loperamide therapy;
grade 3 or higher fasting hyperglycemia persisting for >1
week despite treatment with either oral antidiabetic agents
or insulin; and grade 3 serum transaminases (aspartate
transaminase and alanine transaminase) for patients with
grade 0-1 at baseline or 7 times the upper limit of normal for patients with grade 2 at baseline.
On-study evaluations included toxicity assessments,
peripheral blood count measurements, and a full chemistry panel every other week. Lipid panel and serum alphafetoprotein (AFP) levels were measured monthly. Patients
were evaluated with computed tomography or magnetic
resonance imaging every 6 weeks; response and progression were evaluated by independent radiologic review
using RECIST criteria.12
Correlative Analyses
Genotyping was performed on formalin-fixed, paraffinembedded tissue. Eleven of 25 patient samples from the
phase 2 portion of the study were available for evaluation.
Total nucleic acids were isolated using a custom platform
based on the Agencourt FormaPure system (Beckman
Coulter Genomics). Nucleic acids were screened for 120
somatic mutations across 13 essential cancer genes (APC,
BRAF, CTNNB1, EGFR, FLT3, JAK2, KIT, KRAS,
NOTCH1, NRAS, PIK3CA, PTEN, and TP53) using a
high-throughput assay based on the ABI Prism SNaPshot
Multiplex system.13 Mutations were confirmed by direct
sequencing.

Immunohistochemical staining was performed on
formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections using
standard methods and the following polyclonal antibodies
and dilutions (Cell Signaling Technology): 1:50 phospho-Akt (Ser473), 1:15 phospho-mTOR (Ser2448) and
1:75 phospho-Ribosomal Protein S6 (Ser235/236). Activation of Akt/mTOR signaling was defined as an IHC
score of 2þ to 3þ (moderate to high) across each target
protein on a scale of 0 to 3þ.
Statistical Methods
The primary endpoint for the phase 1 portion was determination of the safety of everolimus. Two planned dose
levels of everolimus were evaluated based on previous
studies demonstrating that the optimum biologic dose is
10 mg. The primary endpoint for the phase 2 portion was
the progression-free survival (PFS) rate at 24 weeks.
The trial was prespecified to include patients from
the phase 1 portion (no more than 2 dose levels) into the
phase 2 portion of the study. The phase 2 portion had a 2stage design, with a target accrual of 22 evaluable patients
for the first stage and a total of 40 patients for the whole
study. If at least 3 of the evaluable patients included in the
analysis for the first stage of the phase 2 portion were progression-free at 24 weeks, the trial would proceed to the
second stage. We hypothesized that everolimus would
improve the 24-week PFS rate from 10% to 25%. As
designed, the overall study with 40 evaluable patients
would have an 80% power at a 0.05 level of significance
to detect a 15% difference of 24-week PFS rate from 10%
to 25%.
Secondary endpoints included overall response rate,
toxicity, time to tumor progression (TTP), median PFS,
and overall survival. The Kaplan-Meier method was used
to estimate the distribution of PFS and survival. All analyses were performed using SAS version 9.2 software (SAS
Institute, Cary, NC).

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
Between October 2007 and June 2009, 28 patients
entered into the trial (9 in phase 1, 19 in phase 2) and all
were evaluable for efficacy and toxicity based on intention-to-treat analysis (Figure 1). Baseline patient characteristics are summarized in Table 1. There were 18 men
(64%) and 10 women (36%) with a median age of 65
years (range, 33-81 years). Median Eastern Cooperative
Oncology Group performance status was 1 (range, 0-2).

5096

Twenty-three (82%) patients had underlying Child-Pugh
class A cirrhosis and 13 (47%) patients had hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. The majority of patients had Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage
C (26 [93%]) and extrahepatic (24 [86%]) disease.
Twenty patients (71%) had received prior systemic therapy, including 11 (39%) patients who had received prior
sorafenib therapy and 9 (32%) patients who had received
other systemic regimens, including bevacizumab alone or
in combination with gemcitabine/oxaliplatin and sunitinib or ramucirumab on clinical trials. The median serum
bilirubin level was 0.6 mg/dL (range, 0.6-2.9 mg/dL), and
23 (82%) patients had an elevated serum AFP level at the
time of study entry.
Toxicity
In the phase 1 portion of the study, dose-finding escalation was performed with 2 planned dosages of 5 mg/day
and 10 mg/day. Three patients were initially enrolled at
the 5 mg/day dosage level. No DLTs were encountered
during cycle 1 of treatment; therefore, an additional 3
patients were enrolled at the 10 mg/day dosage level. One
patient developed grade 3 lymphopenia thought to be
related to everolimus. An additional 3 patients were enrolled at the 10 mg/day dosage level. No DLTs were
encountered, and the phase 2 dosage was determined to
be 10 mg/day.
The 2-stage phase 2 portion of the study proceeded
with an additional 19 patients enrolled, for a total of 25
patients treated with the 10 mg/day dosage and included
in stage 1 analysis of the phase 2 portion of the study. Per
protocol specification, 3 additional patients were enrolled
to have 22 patients evaluable for efficacy for the first stage
of the phase 2 study, as 1 withdrew consent during the
first cycle of treatment and 2 patients were removed for
unacceptable toxicities before completing the first set of
restaging scans. A total of 60 cycles were administered,
with a mean dosage of 373 mg per 6-week cycle (6 weeks);
88.8% of the targeted dosage was delivered to the 25
patients included in the phase 2 analysis.
Everolimus was generally well tolerated at the 10
mg/day dosage. The most common all-grades adverse
events thought to be at least possibly related to everolimus
included fatigue, hyperglycemia, diarrhea, myelosuppression, transient elevation of transaminase levels, hyponatremia, anorexia, stomatitis, and rash (Table 2).
Grade 3 or 4 events were relatively infrequent. Transient elevation of transaminase levels was observed, with 3
(12%) patients experiencing grade 3 elevations of

aspartate transaminase and 1 (4%) patient experiencing
grade 3 elevations of alanine transaminase. Grade 3 lymphopenia was seen in 3 (12%) patients, and 2 (8%)
patients had grade 3 hyponatremia; 3 other grade 3 events
(hyperglycemia, rash, and proteinuria), were seen in 1
patient each. One patient had grade 4 anemia secondary
to gastrointestinal bleeding. This patient was found to
have gastric antral vascular ectasia on endoscopy and was
treated with argon plasma photocoagulation; treatment
was resumed without recurrent bleeding episodes. Grade
4 hypoxia occurred in 1 patient with underlying chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease and pneumonia without
evidence of pneumonitis.
Clinical Efficacy
Clinical efficacy was analyzed in all 25 patients treated at
the 10 mg/day dosage level. Everolimus induced a partial

response in 1 (4%) patient (95% confidence interval [CI],
0.9%-19.6%) and 10 (40%) patients (95% CI, 23%59%) achieved stable disease (SD) for at least 12 weeks
with a disease control rate of 44%. Seven patients (25%)
had a >50% decrease in serum AFP level from baseline. A
waterfall plot of the percent change in the sum of diameters of tumor lesions from baseline in 22 patients with
available repeat scans is shown in Figure 2A.
With a median follow-up time of 7.2 months, the
median PFS of this cohort was 3.8 months (95% CI, 2.14.6 months) (Figure 2B), the median TTP was 3.9
months (95% CI, 2.1-5.5 months), and the median overall survival was 8.4 months (95% CI, 3.9-21.1 months)
(Figure 2C). Because only 2 (8%) patients were progression-free at 24 weeks, the study did not proceed to the second stage of the phase 2 portion of the study. The
estimated PFS rates at 24 weeks and 12 weeks, based on

phosphorylation of mTOR at Ser2448 (p-mTOR), and
phosphorylation of the downstream mTOR complex 1
target, ribosomal protein S6 at Ser235/236 (p-RPS6). Robust pathway activation in tumor tissue was observed in 3
out of 11 patient samples (Table 3). Moderate (2þ) to
high (3þ) levels of p-Akt, p-mTOR, and p-RPS6 were
noted in a patient demonstrating a partial response to
everolimus as well as the CTNNB1 mutant–positive
patient experiencing SD (Figure 3B and Table 3). Strong
signaling (3þ) was observed in a patient with steatohepatitis experiencing 18 weeks of SD. Statistical significance
was not reached, possibly due to limited sample size.

Key cancer gene mutations were queried using a previously published testing platform that was established in
our institution.13 Of 11 available samples tested, a mutation in CTNNB1 (G34E; 101G>A) was identified in 1
patient (Figure 3A and Table 3). This patient experienced
SD during the first 2 cycles of everolimus treatment. No
other gene mutations were identified.
Activation of the Akt/mTOR pathway was identified through phosphorylation of Akt at Ser473 (p-Akt),

DISCUSSION
Approval of sorafenib has stimulated drug development
research in advanced HCC. However, most current efforts
are focused on antiangiogenic agents, and several VEGF
receptor–targeted agents are being evaluated in phase 3
clinical trials. For patients who have progressed or cannot
tolerate sorafenib, there are currently no standard therapies. Therefore, there is an urgent unmet need to develop
additional effective agents, particularly those with novel
mechanisms of action that target hepatocarcinogenesis. In
this single-arm phase 1/2 study, 10 mg/day everolimus
was defined as the phase 2 dosage and demonstrated preliminary activity in advanced HCC patients.
Daily and weekly dosing of everolimus have both
been explored in other phase 1 studies. Everolimus given
at 10 mg/day has inhibited mTOR activity in peripheral
mononuclear cells, skin cells, and tumors, as measured by
abrogated phosphorylation of downstream target proteins.14-16 In addition, these studies have suggested that
daily dosing may result in more profound and persistent
inhibition of mTOR activity than weekly administration.
Chen et al17 reported their early experience of a randomized phase 1 and pharmacokinetic study of everolimus in
advanced HCC. Two different schedules were tested in
this randomized phase 1 study: continuous daily dosing
and weekly dosing. DLTs observed included hyperbilirubinemia, ALT elevation, thrombocytopenia, infection, diarrhea, and cardiac ischemia. The MTD for the weekly
and daily dosing schedule was determined to be 70 mg
and 7.5 mg, respectively. Interestingly, reactivation of
HBV was observed in 4 patients, and flaring of HCV was
observed in 1 patient.
Given prior extensive experience of everolimus dosing in previous studies in other tumors, we chose a daily
schedule and only examined 2 planned dosage levels at 5

our study, only 1 patient developed grade 3 lymphopenia

events were relatively infrequent and included elevation of
aspartate transaminase levels (12%), lymphopenia (12%),
and hyponatremia (8%). Grade 4 events were rare and
included 1 patient each with anemia and hypoxia. All
patients with HBV in our study received suppressive antiHBV therapy while on everolimus and no reactivation of
HBV or HCV flaring were seen. Given the known immunosuppressive activity of mTOR inhibitors, patients with
HBV and HCV infection should have their liver function
tests and viral load closely monitored.
Although the first stage of the phase 2 portion of the
study did not reach the criteria to proceed with the second
stage, it provided initial evidence of antitumor activity of
single agent everolimus at 10 mg/day in advanced HCC.
Despite inclusion of a heavily pretreated population in
our study (71% received prior systemic therapy, including
39% with prior sorafenib use and 32% with 2 prior systemic regimens), we observed a disease control rate, median PFS, and median TTP of 44%, 3.8 months, and 3.9
months, respectively. However, most patients had SD of
short duration, which contributed to only 2 patients being
progression-free at 24 weeks in the phase 2 portion of the
study. Due to the limitations of our study (small sample
size, lack of a randomized control arm, potential for
patient selection bias, and heterogeneity of the patient
population), clinical activity of everolimus should be further defined in advanced HCC in future trials. Our study
also underscores the importance and challenges of optimally designing phase 2 trials in HCC and the value of
including a randomized control arm.18
No common somatic mutations in cancer driver
genes known to regulate the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling
pathway were identified in a small cohort of patients with
archived tissue samples available. However, immunohistochemical analysis identified activation of Akt/mTOR
signaling in more than 25% of samples evaluated. The
complexity of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway has become
increasingly recognized, particularly in relation to its
potential as a therapeutic target in cancer.19,20 Prior data

suggest the presence of a negative feedback loop, whereby
increased activation of mTOR leads to a physiologic brake
on further stimulation of this pathway.21-24 In some tumor types, mTOR inhibitors may interfere with this inhibitory feedback, resulting in a paradoxical increase in
signaling by PI3K and increased activation of other Akt
target proteins that promote cell survival. Although the
loss of this negative feedback from mTOR inhibition may
limit the efficacy of single-agent mTOR inhibitors in
these tumor types, it supports investigation of treatment
regimens that combine mTOR inhibitors with other
agents, such as direct inhibitors of PI3K, Akt, or upstream
receptor tyrosine kinases.
In conclusion, everolimus given at 10 mg/day as a
single agent was well tolerated in patients with advanced
HCC. Although the study did not meet the predefined
criteria to proceed to the second stage of phase 2, everolimus demonstrated preliminary antitumor activity in
patients with advanced HCC, most of whom had received
prior systemic therapy. Given substantial data implicating
activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway in HCC, the
unique mechanism of action of mTOR inhibitors, and
preliminary clinical experience, additional studies are
needed in patients with HCC to further define its efficacy
either alone or in combination with sorafenib or other
agents that might have additive or synergistic activity by
modulating additional components of the PI3K/Akt/
mTOR or other signaling pathways.
