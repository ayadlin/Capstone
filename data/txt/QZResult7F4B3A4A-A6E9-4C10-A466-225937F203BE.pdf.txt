BACKGROUND: Docetaxel, cisplatin, and 5-flurouracil (DCF) administered every 3 weeks produces a high rate of
treatment-related adverse events. The objective of the current study was to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of a
weekly formulation of DCF. METHODS: Data from 117 patients treated at The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center from 2002 to 2006 with a weekly formulation of DCF were retrospectively collected. A total of 95
patients received front-line therapy with 20 mg/m2 of cisplatin, 350 mg/m2 of 5-fluorouracil, and 20 mg/m2 of docetaxel administered once weekly for 6 consecutive weeks followed by a 2-week break. RESULTS: Ninety-five patients
(median age, 62 years [range, 33 to 87 years], with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 1
or 2 in 67%) received a median of 10 weeks of DCF treatment (range, 3-41 weeks). Grade 3 or 4 hematologic toxicity
(assessed according to National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria [version 3.0]) included granulocytopenia (4 patients) and anemia (9 patients). None of the patients developed a febrile neutropenic infection, but grade
3 or 4 non-neutropenic infections occurred in 8 patients. Eighty patients had measurable disease with an objective
response rate determined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria of 34% (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 24-45%). The median follow-up was 9 months, with a median time to disease progression
of 4.1 months (95% CI, 3.6-5.7 months) and a median overall survival of 8.9 months (95% CI, 7.7-10.8 months). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with advanced gastric and esophageal cancer who were not candidates for every-3-week
DCF, a weekly formulation of DCF demonstrated modest activity with minimal hematologic toxicity, suggesting that

Gastric, gastroesophageal junction, and esophageal carcinoma are aggressive malignancies in which survival remains

dismal. The 5-year overall survival rate is 24% for gastric cancer and 19% for esophageal cancer.1 For patients with metastatic disease, the median survivals for those who received chemotherapy in recent large phase 3 studies are approximately
8 to 11 months.2,3
In 2006, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved docetaxel to be used in combination with cisplatin
and infusional 5-fluorouracil every 3 weeks as first-line therapy for advanced gastric and gastroesophageal junction cancers. In the randomized phase 3 trial that compared every-3-week therapy with docetaxel at a dose of 75 mg/m2 on Day 1,
cisplatin at a dose of 75 mg/m2 on Day 1, and infusional 5-fluorouracil at a dose of 750 mg/m2/day on Days 1 to 5 (DCF)
with every-4-week cisplatin plus infusional 5-fluorouracil (CF), the median time to tumor progression (TTP) and median
overall survival (OS) were found to be significantly higher with every-3-week DCF.3 With longer follow-up, a subsequent

analysis demonstrated that deterioration in quality of life
was delayed for those patients on the DCF arm of the
study.4,5 However, among DCF-treated patients, 82%
had grade 3 or 4 neutropenia and febrile neutropenia
developed in 29%. In addition, common toxicities
reported with every-3-week DCF were anemia, thrombocytopenia, and other nonhematologic toxicities including
diarrhea, nausea or vomiting, and stomatitis. In all, 69%
of patients developed treatment-related grade 3 adverse
events. Thus, the higher rate of objective response and
improvement in the median OS with the addition of
docetaxel came at high price. Furthermore, 1 of the biggest criticisms of the trial was that the cohort of patients
enrolled was much younger, with a median age of 55
years. Although the authors concluded that every-3-week
DCF should be considered as the front-line therapy for all
patients with metastatic or advanced unresectable gastric
or gastroesophageal cancers, the high rate of treatmentrelated toxicity limits the applicability of this regimen to
all patients, particularly those who are elderly or have a
poor performance status.6
Several modifications of the every-3-week schedule
of DCF have been investigated in an attempt to minimize
the toxicity noted with this regimen. The primary focus of
these modifications has been to alter the dose and frequency of the cytotoxic agents to allow further applicability of an otherwise proven effective chemotherapy
combination. At the University of Texas M. D. Anderson
Cancer Center (MDACC), patients with gastroesophageal carcinomas who were not considered candidates for a
clinical trial or every-3-week DCF administration were
given a modified weekly formulation of DCF. Herein, we
report our experience with weekly DCF as front-line therapy for their metastatic or advanced gastric, gastroesophageal, or esophageal carcinomas.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
From January 2000 to March 2007, we identified all
patients who had both a diagnosis of gastric, gastroesophageal junction, or esophageal carcinoma from the
MDACC Tumor Registry and received weekly DCF
chemotherapy from the MDACC Pharmacy Database.
A total of 117 patients with the aforementioned
diagnoses treated between November 2002 and October
2006 were identified, but our analysis only included
95 patients who met the following inclusion criteria:
1) received weekly DCF as first-line therapy for either
metastatic or locally advanced unresectable disease;
Cancer

2) received no other concomitant targeted therapy such as
bevacizumab or cetuximab; 3) had a histologically confirmed diagnosis of gastric, gastroesophageal, or esophageal carcinoma at MDACC; 4) received at least 3 weekly
doses of DCF; and 5) had documented follow-up with a
physician visit and a radiographic tumor evaluation. The
interval between each restaging evaluation was determined by the treating physician, and was generally conducted every 8 weeks. Patients who initially received DCF
every 3 weeks before weekly administration were
excluded. Patients with either evaluable or measurable disease were included. This retrospective analysis was
approved and performed in accordance with the ethical
standards described by the MDACC Institutional Review
Board.
All medical records were reviewed for information
regarding demographic data, tumor characteristics, treatment toxicities, and laboratory values. Hematologic toxicity was assessed according to National Cancer Institute
Common Toxicity Criteria (NCICTC) (version 3.0) and
reported as the maximum grade anytime during the
weekly DCF therapy. Due to the difficulty with retrospective grading of nonlaboratory toxicity, such toxicity was
recorded as either present or absent as reported by the
patients. Tumor responses were determined retrospectively by 2 authors (S.K. and M.O.) using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) (version 1.0).7
Treatment
Weekly DCF was administered according to a standardized order set using cisplatin at a dose of 20 mg/m2 given
intravenously (iv) over 1 hour, 5-fluorouracil at a dose of
350 mg/m2 iv bolus administered over 15 minutes, and
docetaxel at a dose of 20 mg/m2 iv given over 30 minutes,
each administered every week for 6 consecutive weeks followed by a 2-week break (an overall 8-week cycle). Eight
of the patients included in this analysis started with and
received a slightly modified administration schedule, with
6 patients receiving weekly DCF for 3 consecutive weeks
every 4 weeks and 2 patients receiving DCF for 2 consecutive weeks every 3 weeks.
Statistical Analysis
The primary objective of the current study was to assess
the therapeutic efficacy by objective response rate (ORR).
Secondary objectives were to assess the toxicity of weekly
DCF, in particular hematologic toxicity; median OS; and
median TTP. The Kaplan-Meier product-limit method,
calculated from the initiation of of chemotherapy to death

or disease progression, was used to generate the survival
and TTP curves. Disease progression was defined as either
clinical deterioration requiring early termination, objective radiographic progression, or death within 12 weeks
after last tumor assessment. For TTP analysis, the data are
reported with and without censoring for patients who
underwent subsequent anticancer therapy. Patients who
received new anticancer therapy (such as radiotherapy,
surgical resection, or additional chemotherapy) before disease progression were censored at the date of their last
tumor assessment before the new anticancer therapy was
initiated. To study the effects of explanatory covariates on
OS, Cox proportional hazards regression models were
used to assess the hazards ratios (HR). In univariate Cox
regression, the effects of variables were modeled individually. All variables were then included into an initial multivariate Cox proportional hazards model, and a stepwise
model selection procedure was performed with equal
entering and staying probabilities of 0.1. All computations were performed on DELL PCs using the Windows
NT operating system in SAS (SAS institute Inc, Cary,
NC) and S-plus 8.0 (Insightful Corp., Seattle, Wash) statistical software.

RESULTS
Overall, we identified 117 patients with gastric, gastroesophageal junction, or esophageal carcinoma who were
treated with weekly DCF at MDACC between November
2002 and October 2006. Twenty-two patients who did
not meet the inclusion criteria for this analysis were
excluded: 7 patients received weekly DCF as a second-line
regimen, 8 patients received <3 weeks of therapy, 2
patients received therapy in the adjuvant or neoadjuvant
setting, 2 patients received additional targeted therapy
along with weekly DCF, and 3 patients lacked adequate
follow-up for toxicity and response assessment. The final
analysis included 95 patients.
Patients and Treatment
Baseline characteristics are presented in Table 1. The median patient age was 62 years (range, 33-87 years) with
22% of the population (21 patients) aged 70 years.
Approximately 19% of patients had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS)
of 2. The majority of patients had metastatic disease

patient). No deaths related to treatment toxicity were
identified.
Fatigue, nausea or vomiting, and diarrhea were
reported at least once during the treatment course by
53%, 54%, and 29% of patients, respectively. Twentytwo patients (23%) required hospitalization during their
course of chemotherapy. The most common reasons for
admission included dehydration (6 patients), non-neutropenic fever (7 patients), declining functional status (2
patients), symptomatic pulmonary embolism (2 patients),
and inadequate pain control (2 patient). Eight patients
had dose reductions, with the most common reason being
nausea and vomiting (3 patients). Dose delays or dose
omissions occurred in 19 patients, with the most common
causes being neutropenia (5 patients), anemia (3 patients),
and thrombocytopenia (3 patients).
Efficacy Outcomes
Among the 80 patients with measurable disease by
Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)
criteria at baseline, the ORR was 34% (95% confidence
interval [95% CI], 23-45%) with 1 complete response
and 26 partial responses noted (Table 3). The overall
TTP was 5.3 months (95% CI, 3.9-6.1 months) (Fig. 1).

Twenty-seven (28%) patients with either stable or
responding disease underwent subsequent cancerdirected therapy before progression on DCF. For this
group of patients, further therapy included chemoradiation in 23, chemoradiation followed by surgical resection in 3, and alternate chemotherapy in 1 patient. The
TTP censored for subsequent anticancer therapy was
4.1 months (95% CI, 3.6-5.7 months) (Fig. 1). Of the
3 patients who underwent subsequent surgical resection,
2 had died from disease and 1 remained without evidence of disease recurrence at 35 months after surgical
resection. Thirty-five patients went on to receive additional chemotherapy. Second-line chemotherapy was
comprised of oxaliplatin-based treatment in 22 patients,
irinotecan-based treatment in 7 patients, experimental
protocol-based treatment in 4 patients, capecitabine
monotherapy in 2 patients, and single-agent gemcitabine in 1 patient.
The median follow-up was 9 months (range, 1-53
months), with 82 (86%) patients dead at the time of last
follow-up. The median OS survival was 8.9 months (95%
CI, 7.7-10.8 months), and the 1-year and 2-year survival
rates were 36% (95% CI, 22-49%) and 13% (95% CI, 333%), respectively (Fig. 1).
Patients aged 70 years had a median TTP of 6.8
months (95% CI, 4.1-10.9 months) and median OS of
10.9 months (95% CI, 6.8-13.2 months). Patients with
an ECOG PS of 2 demonstrated a worse outcome, with a
median TTP of 1.6 months (95% CI, 1.5-4.5 months)
and a median OS of 5.59 months (95% CI, 3.3-8.3
months). On multivariate survival analysis, the only statistically significant factor was ECOG PS, with worse OS
observed in patients with an ECOG PS of 2 (HR, 2.88;
95% CI, 1.51-5.51 [P Â¼ .001]).

DISCUSSION
The weekly administration of DCF appears to be well-tolerated, with limited hematologic toxicities. Moreover,
this weekly regimen demonstrated activity in patients who
were generally believed to be poor candidates for the
administration of DCF every 3 weeks, with a response
rate of 34%, a median TTP of 4.1 months, and a median
OS of 8.9 months. As a retrospective study, these results
are hypothesis-generating and suggest that further examination of altered administration schedules of these 3 active
chemotherapeutic agents in gastroesophageal cancer
should continue.
A recent meta-analysis demonstrated a survival benefit for the use of combination chemotherapy compared
with single-agent chemotherapy in patients with advanced
gastric cancer.8 The benefit of a triplet combination over a
doublet combination has been less well-established,

1450

although the addition of an anthracycline or taxane to the
combination of 5-fluorouracil and a platinum compound
has become common. The largest study to demonstrate
the superiority of a triplet chemotherapy combination was
the randomized phase 3 study comparing the addition
of docetaxel to the combination of cisplatin and
5-fluorouracil.3 This addition resulted in statistically
significant improvements in response rate (37% compared with 25%), median TTP (5.6 months compared
with 3.7 months), and median OS (9.2 months compared
with 8.6 months) in favor of the DCF treatment arm. Despite enrolling a young population (median age, 55 years)
with good functional status (ECOG PS of 0-1), significant toxicity was observed with this triplet combination.
Neutropenic infections occurred in 29% of patients,
grade 3 or 4 neutropenia occurred in 82% of patients, and
grade 3 or 4 gastrointestinal toxicity occurred in 49% of
patients.
Weekly DCF, as studied in this report, results in low
rates of hematologic toxicity with no neutropenic infections and a 4% rate of grade 3 or 4 neutropenia. Due to
the retrospective nature of this study, grading of nonhematologic toxicities was not possible. Although 23% of
patients were hospitalized for primarily nonhematologic
toxicities, dose reductions and dose delays for nonhematologic toxicities were infrequent, occurring in <10% of
patients. Despite the methodologic differences between
this study and the phase 3 study of every-3-week DCF,
the findings of the current study can at least propose that
the weekly administration of DCF results in a lower rate
of hematologic toxicity. This finding is not surprising
given the improved hematologic tolerance of the weekly
administration of docetaxel when compared with every-3week administration in other cancer types.9-11
The 34% response rate reported with weekly DCF
appears similar to the 37% response rate noted with every-3-week DCF.3 However, in contrast to this study, in
which RECIST methodology was used, the response rate
evaluation in the phase 3 study of every-3-week DCF used
the World Health Organization response criteria, in
which a partial response is defined as a decrease of 50%
in the bidimensional size of a lesion. The median OS of
8.9 months is similar to the 9.2 months noted with the every-3-week DCF regimen, but the lower percentage of
metastatic patients included in this study (66% in comparison with 97%) likely contributes to the high median
OS noted in the current study. Because a large percentage
of patients with locally advanced, unresectable cancer
received consolidative chemoradiation before progressing

on weekly DCF, a TTP censored for additional anticancer

4.1-month TTP is likely a more accurate comparator
value to the 5.6-month TTP noted in the phase 3 study of
every-3-week DCF.
A critical goal for the treatment of advanced gastroesophageal carcinoma is the fine balance between optimizing the treatment efficacy and improving quality of life.
This becomes extremely important in this population of
patients because the majority of patients will present with
multiple comorbidities, significant weight loss, and
diminished functional status.12 However, patients enrolled in phase 2 and 3 trials in gastroesophageal cancer

Cancer

March 15, 2010

represent a selected subset of patients with good physical
and biochemical PS. For example, in the phase 2 GASTRO-TAX study of every-other-week DCF, the median
patient age was 53 years, and 75% of patients had an
ECOG PS of 0.13 In the phase 3 study of every-3-week
DCF, the median patient age was 55 years, and 64% had
an ECOG PS of 0.3 Information regarding the tolerability
of newer chemotherapeutic combinations in more relevant and realistic populations of patients diagnosed with
metastatic or advanced gastroesophageal cancers, particularly the elderly and less fit, is needed. In the current
study, the median age of the patients was 62 years with an
ECOG PS of 1 or 2 in 48% and 19% of patients,

1451

Original Article

respectively. It is interesting to note that an analysis of the
Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) and
Medicare registries has demonstrated that elderly patients
are less likely to receive chemotherapy.14 Whether this
decreased use of chemotherapy in the elderly is appropriate is not known, but the current phase 2 and phase 3
studies evaluating the young and fit will not answer this
question.
In this report, the 21 patients who were aged 70
years demonstrated good tolerance of weekly DCF,
received the same number of treatments, and had similar
TTP and OS as patients aged <70 years. However, the
18 patients with an ECOG PS of 2 received less treatment
and had worse outcomes. The median TTP for this group
was 1.6 months and the median OS was 5.6 months, which
is similar to the expected survival for untreated patients.15
Despite the improved tolerance of this regimen, this finding strongly suggests that patients with poor PS will not
benefit from receiving combination chemotherapy.
Other studies have investigated alternative dose and
administration schedules of DCF (Table 4). A phase 2
trial of a lower dosage of DCF administered every 3 weeks
(docetaxel at a dose of 50 mg/m2, cisplatin at a dose of 80
mg/m2, and 5-fluorouracil as a continuous infusion of
1200 mg/m2 over 72 hours) reported a high rate of hematologic and gastrointestinal adverse events with grade 3
neutropenia reported in 68% of patients, febrile neutropenia in 28% of patients, and stomatitis in 21% of
patients.16 The phase 2 GASTRO-TAX trial, which investigated every-other-week docetaxel at a dose of 40 mg/m2
and cisplatin at a dose of 40 mg/m2 combined with weekly
5-fluorouracial at a dose of 2000 mg/m2 over 24 hours,
reported rates of grade 3 or 4 neutropenia of 23%, febrile
neutropenia of 5%, and grade 3 or 4 diarrhea of 20%.13 A
preliminary report of a multicenter phase 2 study with a
modified DCF regimen of docetaxel at a dose of 30 mg/
m2 on Days 1 and 8, cisplatin at a dose of 60 mg/m2 on
Day 1, and 5-fluorouracil as a continuous infusion of 200
mg/m2/day for 21 days every 3 weeks demonstrated a 4%
rate of febrile neutropenia and a 10% rate of grade 3 or 4
diarrhea.17 These various trials, along with the current
study, illustrate the potential toxicity benefit from administration schedules other than every-3-week DCF.
Another route to improve toxicity has been the
substitution of oxaliplatin for cisplatin. In the phase 3
REAL-2 trial, the comparison of oxaliplatin combinations with cisplatin combinations demonstrated equivalent efficacy and a reduction in both neutropenia and
renal toxicity with the use of oxaliplatin-based combina-

tions.2 A phase 2 study of D-FOX (docetaxel at a dose
of 50 mg/m2 on Day 1, oxaliplatin at a dose of 85 mg/
m2 on Day 1, and 5-fluorouracil as a continuous infusion of 2200 mg/m2 over 48 hours on Days 1 to 2 every 2 weeks) demonstrated no episodes of febrile
neutropenia in 36 treated patients.18
There are several limitations to this retrospective
study, and our findings are only hypothesis-generating.
The evaluation of toxicity, in particular nonhematologic
toxicity, is limited in this study by its retrospective nature.
The exact reason for the selection of this therapy by the
treating physician could not be determined. The population studied in the current report is heterogeneous, and
analysis of various subsets was severely limited by the
small sample size. The response rate was determined retrospectively, although strict RECIST criteria were used.
Finally, the impact of this therapy on quality of life could
not be determined.
Weekly DCF, as studied in the current study, is a new
and tolerable first-line palliative regimen for patients with
advanced gastroesophageal cancer. Despite the improved
tolerance, patients with an ECOG PS of 2 did not benefit
from treatment. Further prospective study of alternate
administration schedules of these active chemotherapeutic
agents in gastroesophageal cancer should continue.
