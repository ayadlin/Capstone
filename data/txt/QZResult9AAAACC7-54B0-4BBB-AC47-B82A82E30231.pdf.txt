ABSTRACT
Inhibition of the HSP90 chaperone results in depletion of many signaling proteins
that drive tumorigenesis, such as downstream effectors of KRAS, the most commonly
mutated human oncogene. As a consequence, several small-molecule HSP90 inhibitors
are being evaluated in clinical trials as anticancer agents. To prospectively identify
mechanisms through which HSP90-dependent cancer cells evade pharmacologic
HSP90 blockade, we generated multiple mutant KRAS-driven cancer cell lines with
acquired resistance to the purine-scaffold HSP90 inhibitor PU-H71. All cell lines
retained dependence on HSP90 function, as evidenced by sensitivity to short hairpin
RNA-mediated suppression of HSP90AA1 or HSP90AB1 (also called HSP90α and
HSP90β, respectively), and exhibited two types of genomic alterations that interfere
with the effects of PU-H71 on cell viability and proliferation: (i) a Y142N missense
mutation in the ATP-binding domain of HSP90α that co-occurred with amplification
of the HSP90AA1 locus, (ii) genomic amplification and overexpression of the ABCB1
gene encoding the MDR1 drug efflux pump. In support of a functional role for these
alterations, exogenous expression of HSP90α Y142N conferred PU-H71 resistance
to HSP90-dependent cells, and pharmacologic MDR1 inhibition with tariquidar or
lowering ABCB1 expression restored sensitivity to PU-H71 in ABCB1-amplified
cells. Finally, comparison with structurally distinct HSP90 inhibitors currently in
clinical development revealed that PU-H71 resistance could be overcome, in part, by
ganetespib (also known as STA9090) but not tanespimycin (also known as 17-AAG).
Together, these data identify potential mechanisms of acquired resistance to small
molecules targeting HSP90 that may warrant proactive screening for additional HSP90
inhibitors or rational combination therapies.

INTRODUCTION

and HSP90β (encoded by HSP90AB1) are localized in
the cytoplasm and comprise a large fraction of cytosolic
proteins in unstressed cells [1, 2]. Among the more than 200
HSP90 clients are many proteins required for tumor growth,
including primary cancer “drivers” such as BCR-ABL1,
wildtype ERBB2 and mutant forms of EGFR, ERBB2,
FLT3, JAK2 and KIT, as well as critical downstream
effectors of these oncoproteins such as AKT1 and RAF1 [3].

Heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) constitutes a
functionally diverse superfamily of highly conserved
chaperone proteins that aid in the proper folding, assembly
and localization of many cellular proteins, termed “clients”,
as well as protecting proteins from proteasomal degradation.

The capacity of HSP90 to protect key oncogenic
proteins from degradation has spurred the development
of small molecules that interfere with the conformational
cycling of HSP90 through binding to its N-terminal
nucleotide pocket and locking it in a nucleotide-bound
form [4], which in turn leads to the depletion of misfolded,
inactive or unstable client proteins. There are, or have
been, nearly 20 HSP90 inhibitors in clinical development
[5], which are structurally classified as derivatives of
geldanamycin, resorcinol, purine, dihydroindazolone,
dihydropyridopyrimidine and tropane [6]. For example,
the geldanamycin derivative tanespimycin (also called 17AAG) was the first HSP90 inhibitor that entered clinical
trials [7], and PU-H71 is a newer and more efficient, watersoluble purine analog [8] that is currently being tested in two
phase 1 trials (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifiers NCT01581541
and NCT01393509). The most promising clinical results
with these drugs have been achieved in cancers that are
addicted to certain HSP90 clients. For example, a phase
2 trial demonstrated that the combined administration of
trastuzumab and tanespimycin in patients with trastuzumabresistant ERBB2-positive breast cancer was associated with
a clinical benefit rate of 59% and a median progression-free
and overall survival of six and 17 months, respectively [9].
Another phase 2 study showed that the resorcinol-derived
HSP90 inhibitor ganetespib (also called STA9090) has
clinical activity in trastuzumab-resistant ERBB2-positive
as well as triple-negative breast cancer [10].
Preclinical data suggest that HSP90 inhibition
could also be effective in cancers that acquired resistance
to other targeted therapeutics, such as mutant EGFRdriven lung adenocarcinoma [11]. Common mechanisms
of resistance to ATP-competitive EGFR tyrosine kinase
inhibitors such as gefitinib and erlotinib are the T790M
“gatekeeper” mutation in the EGFR kinase domain [12],
and amplification and/or overexpression of the MET and
AXL receptor tyrosine kinases [13, 14], which take over
the function of inhibited EGFR to sustain tumor growth.
This so-called “oncogenic switch” may be overcome by
HSP90 inhibition since EGFR, MET, AXL and BRAF are
all HSP90 clients [15]. In line with this, Xu et al. (2012)
could show that combined EGFR and HSP90 inhibitor
treatment efficiently reduced the growth of lung tumors
driven by EGFRT790M and MET in mice [11].
Due to their pleiotropic effects on multiple signaling
proteins, HSP90 inhibitors may also prove useful for
the treatment of cancers driven by oncoproteins that are
difficult to target directly. For example, among the diverse
substrates of HSP90 are several immediate downstream
effectors as well as more “distant” candidate synthetic
lethal interactors of mutant KRAS, the most common
human oncogene which has evaded all attempts at
therapeutic targeting so far [16–20]. Indeed, molecularly
stratified clinical trials of HSP90 inhibitors include,
for example, patients with KRAS mutant lung cancer
(ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT01124864).
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Previous studies have extensively investigated the
near-obligatory development of resistance in cancers
treated with kinase inhibitors [21]. In contrast, it is largely
unknown whether and how cancer cells can also escape
the effects of HSP90 blockade; however, the preclinical
observation that cultured glioblastoma cells developed
tanespimycin resistance due to reduced expression of the
NAD(P)H dehydrogenase quinone 1, a cellular enzyme
responsible for modifying tanespimycin for increased
binding to HSP90 [22], indicates that clinical resistance
will occur as more patients are being treated with these
agents.
The discovery of several clinically relevant
resistance mechanisms to targeted cancer drugs, for
example mutations affecting FLT3N676 or FLT3G697 in
acute myeloid leukemia [23–25], amplification of the
MET gene in EGFR mutant lung adenocarcinoma [13] or
BRAFV600E splice variants in melanoma [26], was achieved
through systematic analysis of in vitro cancer models with
experimentally induced insensitivity to the respective
agents. Here, we have established multiple mutant KRASdriven cancer cell lines with acquired resistance to the
purine-scaffold HSP90 inhibitor PU-H71 to prospectively
identify mechanisms through which HSP90-dependent
cancer cells evade pharmacologic HSP90 blockade.

RESULTS
Generation of PU-H71-resistant cancer cell lines
To identify mechanisms of resistance to HSP90
inhibition, we chose three KRAS mutant cell lines (A549,
MDA-MB-231, SW480) that are derived from different
cancer types (lung adenocarcinoma, triple-negative breast
cancer, colorectal cancer) and exhibit dependence on
the expression of mutant KRAS and the HSP90 client
protein STK33 [16, 18] (Figure 1A). Short hairpin RNAmediated knockdown experiments demonstrated that all
three cell lines required HSP90α for their viability and
proliferation, and that MDA-MB-231 and SW480 were
also dependent, to a lesser extent, on HSP90β expression
(Figure 1B and Supplementary Figure S1A and S1B). To
induce resistance, cell lines were exposed to increasing
concentrations of PU-H71, starting at 10 nM and scaling
up gradually once the cells started to grow in the presence
of the respective drug concentration, until a final PUH71 concentration of 1 μM was reached. The time after
which stable growth in the presence of 1 μM PU-H71
was achieved varied among the cell lines (A549 and
SW480, approximately eight weeks; MDA-MB-231,
approximately six months), pointing to the acquisition
of different resistance mechanisms. Parental cell lines
without PU-H71 (labeled “P” throughout the manuscript)
were cultured in parallel during generation of the resistant
cell lines (labeled “R” throughout the manuscript) to take
into account possible effects of long-term culture that were

curves (Figure 1C).

were either unchanged (HSP90α) or even slightly reduced
(HSP90β) (Figure 2B). This finding suggested that in
MDA-MB-231 cells, acquired resistance to PU-H71 could
be attributed to upregulation of HSP90α.
To corroborate that resistance to PU-H71 was
mediated, at least in part, through restoration of HSP90
function, we next assessed the chaperone activity of
HSP90 by measuring the abundance of the client proteins
AKT1, RAF1 and STK33, which have been linked to
KRAS-mediated tumorigenesis [18]. As expected, all
three clients were depleted upon acute PU-H71 treatment
in the parental cell lines; in contrast, AKT1, RAF1 and
STK33 protein levels in the resistant cell lines were
comparable to those observed in untreated parental
cell lines (Figure 2C). This result suggested that the
resistant cells had regained HSP90 chaperone function
in the presence of PU-H71. To verify this possibility, we
determined via shRNA knockdown whether the resistant
cells were still reliant on HSP90α and HSP90β. Similar
to their parental counterparts (Figure 1B), the resistant
cell lines showed reduced viability and proliferation upon
knockdown of HSP90α or, to a lesser extent, HSP90β
(Figure 2D, left panel, and Supplementary Figure S1A
and S1C), an effect that was not enhanced further by
the addition of PU-H71 (Figure 2D, right panel, and
Supplementary Figure S1A and S1C). Together, these
findings indicated that all three resistant cell lines had
restored HSP90 function to maintain their viability and
proliferation in the presence of PU-H71.

Regained HSP90 function in PU-H71-resistant
cell lines
To begin to understand the mechanism(s) underlying
the acquired insensitivity to PU-H71, we tested the
stability of the resistance phenotype. A549-R, MDAMB-231-R and SW480-R cells cultured without drug for
a period of six to eight weeks maintained their viability
and proliferation upon re-exposure to 1 μM PU-H71,
pointing to an irreversible genetic alteration, as opposed
to a transient mechanism such as epigenetic modifications
or signaling pathway “rewiring”, underlying the resistance
phenotype (Figure 2A).
To investigate whether changes of HSP90 itself
might contribute to the acquisition of resistance, we
first analyzed HSP90α and HSP90β protein levels in
the parental cell lines, their resistant counterparts and
parental cells treated with 1 μM PU-H71 for 24 hours.
Acute HSP90 inhibition led to slightly increased HSP90α
expression in all parental cell lines (Figure 2B). In
addition, we observed substantially higher HSP90α levels
in MDA-MB-231-R compared to MDA-MB-231-P cells,
whereas HSP90 levels in the other resistant cell lines

variant affects the function of HSP90α (Supplementary
Figure S2B). In addition, we assessed the potential
functional consequences of the Y142N substitution
based on the crystal structure of the HSP90α N-terminal
domain (Protein Data Bank ID: 3T0Z). Residue Y142
forms a hydrogen bond with S164 that might be critical
for maintaining the proper conformation of the adjacent
ATP binding pocket (Figure 3B). Loss of this hydrogen
bond as a result of the lower hydrophobicity and shorter
side chain of asparagine in the Y142N variant might
destabilize the conformation of the N-terminal domain
and change the affinity of the ATP binding pocket for PUH71 (Figure 3C). In accordance with this prediction, we
found reduced binding of mutant HSP90α to the HSP90
inhibitor geldanamycin in MDA-MB-231-R cells despite
higher expression of the mutant protein (Figure 3D). In

We next investigated whether the restoration of HSP90
function in PU-H71-resistant cells might be related to genetic
alterations that render HSP90 insensitive to pharmacologic
inhibition. Sequencing of all HSP90AA1 and HSP90AB1
coding exons in the parental and PU-H71-resistant cell
lines revealed an HSP90AA1 c.T464A mutation, resulting
in a p.Y142N substitution in the N-terminal ATP-binding
domain of HSP90α, in MDA-MB-231-R cells that was not
present in the corresponding parental cell line (Figure 3A;
Supplementary Figure S2A). No HSP90AA1 or HSP90AB1
coding region mutations were found in the other parental or
resistant cell lines (data not shown).

contrast, HSP90α Y142N could bind ATP to a similar
extent as wildtype HSP90α, indicating that the chaperone
function of HSP90α Y142N remains intact (Figure 3E).
In addition to the HSP90α Y142N mutation, DNA
copy number analysis using SNP microarrays identified a
3.5-Mb amplification on chromosome 14q32.31-q32.33 in
MDA-MB-231-R cells, which resulted in two additional
copies of HSP90AA1 (Figure 3F). Given the markedly
increased HSP90α protein levels in MDA-MB-231-R
cells (Figure 2B), these findings suggested that MDAMB-231-R cells had acquired resistance towards PU-H71
through mutation and amplification of the HSP90AA1
locus, leading to overexpression of an HSP90α Y142N
variant.
To test the ability of mutated HSP90α to confer
PU-H71 resistance, we generated MDA-MB-231 cells
stably transduced with wildtype HSP90α, HSP90α
Y142N or an empty control vector (Figure 3G), followed
by exposure to various concentrations of PU-H71 for 24
hours. Measurement of apoptosis by propidium iodide
and annexin V staining and counting of live cells using
trypan blue exclusion demonstrated that cell viability
was rescued by HSP90α Y142N and, in part, wildtype
HSP90α (Figure 3H, Supplementary Figure S3, data
not shown). These findings support the notion that the
HSP90α Y142N variant can confer resistance to HSP90
inhibition by PU-H71.

drug resistance 1 (MDR1), a member of the superfamily
of ATP-binding cassette transporters implicated in many
cases of drug resistance [27, 28]. Consistent with the idea
that ABCB1 is a relevant target of the gained region on
chromosome 7q21.12, gene expression array analysis
demonstrated that ABCB1 mRNA levels were strongly
elevated in A549-R and SW480-R cells compared to their
respective parental lines (Figure 4C).
To evaluate whether the cross-resistance of A549-R
and SW480-R cells could be attributed to enhanced drug
export mediated by MDR1, we tested whether sensitivity
to PU-H71 and puromycin was restored by treatment
with tariquidar, a highly selective, non-competitive
MDR1 inhibitor [29]. In support of this hypothesis, the
combination of tariquidar with PU-H71 or puromycin
decreased the viability of A549-R and SW480-R cells
to a similar extent as PU-H71 or puromycin alone in
drug-sensitive parental cells (Figure 5A). Furthermore,
knockdown of ABCB1 using two different shRNA
constructs also restored the sensitivity of A549-R and
SW480-R cells towards PU-H71, as evidenced by
reduced cell viability (Figure 5B and 5C). Taken together,
these findings indicate that genomic amplification and
overexpression of ABCB1 are the cause of PU-H71
resistance in A549-R and SW480-R cells.

Sensitivity and resistance to structurally diverse
HSP90 inhibitors

Acquired PU-H71 resistance mediated by
amplification and overexpression of ABCB1

We finally investigated whether resistance to
PU-H71 could be overcome by treatment with two
alternative, structurally distinct ATP-competitive HSP90
inhibitors that are currently in clinical development, the
geldanamycin derivative tanespimycin (also known as
17-AAG) and the second-generation triazole ganetespib
(also known as STA9090) [4, 30]. To this end, parental
and PU-H71-resistant cell lines were incubated with 5 μM
tanespimycin, 100 nM ganetespib and 1 μM PU-H71, and
viable cells were counted after three days. As expected,
parental MDA-MB-231 cells were highly sensitive to
both tanespimycin and ganetespib. In contrast, PU-H71insensitive MDA-MB-231-R cells showed complete crossresistance to tanespimycin, consistent with the reduced
binding capacity of geldanamycin to HSP90α Y142N
(Figure 3D); however, ganetespib induced cell death in
MDA-MB-231-R cells, albeit to a lesser extent than in
the parental counterpart (Figure 6A). PU-H71-resistant
SW480-R cells were also insensitive to tanespimycin,
indicating export of this drug via MDR1, whereas
ganetespib was able to induce cell death as effectively as
in SW480-P cells (Figure 6B). Thus, HSP90-dependent
cancer cells that have restored HSP90 function in the
presence of PU-H71 via an HSP90α Y142N mutation
or amplification and overexpression of ABCB1 may
be targeted by alternative HSP90 inhibitors, such as
ganetespib.

Similar to MDA-MB-231-R, A549-R and SW480-R
cells also showed stable PU-H71 resistance (Figure
2A) and had regained HSP90 chaperone function in the
presence of PU-H71 (Figure 2C and 2D; Supplementary
Figure S1). However, we detected no mutations or
changes in gene copy number and/or mRNA expression of
HSP90AA1 and HSP90AB1 in A549-R and SW480-R cells
(Figures 2B and 3F, data not shown). When we exposed the
PU-H71-resistant cell lines to puromycin for selection after
transduction with lentiviral shRNA constructs (Figure 2D),
we noticed that A549-R and SW480-R, but not their
parental counterparts, were insensitive to puromycin.
Incubation with various puromycin concentrations and
measurement of viability and proliferation after three days
demonstrated resistance of A549-R and SW480-R cells to
puromycin concentrations as high as 10 µg/ml (Figure 4A).
Since PU-H71 and puromycin are both purine
analogs, we hypothesized that A549-R and SW480-R
cells might have acquired resistance to these compounds
by upregulation of a transport protein that exports purinelike drugs. To identify such a transporter, we searched
for DNA copy number changes using SNP microarrays
and identified a 1.26-Mb gain on chromosome 7q21.12
that was common to A549-R and SW480-R (Figure 4B).

DISCUSSION

specific KRAS variant [35]. In addition, KRAS is not a
HSP90 client and can therefore not be targeted directly by
HSP90 inhibition [18]. This apparent “undruggability” has
shifted the focus of anti-RAS strategies to the inhibition
of more tractable downstream effectors such as the PI3K/
AKT and RAF/MEK/ERK signaling pathways [36–39].
Certain KRAS effectors, such as AKT1 and RAF1, as well
as STK33 that has been demonstrated to be preferentially
required by mutant KRAS-dependent tumors, are kinases
that are chaperoned by HSP90 [16, 18, 20]. Therefore,
HSP90 inhibition might represent a viable therapeutic
option for patients with KRAS mutant malignancies.
The promising in vitro and in vivo activity of HSP90
inhibitors in preclinical models of various cancer types has
led to a large number of clinical trials testing the efficacy
of these drugs as monotherapy and in combination with
other targeted therapies in hematologic and solid-organ
malignancies [5]; (https://clinicaltrials.gov). Based on the
premise that, in analogy to other targeted cancer therapies,
resistance to HSP90 inhibitors will inevitably occur, we
sought to prospectively identify underlying mechanisms,
which may guide sequential or simultaneous treatment
strategies to overcome or prevent escape from HSP90

Cancer cells are particularly dependent on the
chaperone function of HSP90, which has prompted
the development of several small-molecule HSP90
inhibitors that may provide a substantive therapeutic
window. One reason for this dependence is that cancer
cells harbor highly active, cancer cell-specific HSP90
that is present in multi-chaperone complexes, which have
a markedly higher affinity towards HSP90 inhibitors
than uncomplexed HSP90 in normal cells [31, 32]. In
addition, cancer cells are frequently addicted to mutated
or overexpressed oncoproteins whose proper folding and
function is controlled and maintained by HSP90 [15, 33].
KRAS is a central node in signaling pathways that
promote cell growth and survival, and is constitutively
activated by mutations in one third of cancers. Previous
attempts at direct targeting mutant RAS by disrupting its
GTP-bound form or by interfering with its cell membrane
localization have been unsuccessful [34], although
compounds that irreversibly bind to the KRAS G12C
protein, thereby changing its intrinsic preference for
GTP over GDP, may provide a novel means to target this

inhibition. By using KRAS mutant lung, breast and colon
cancer cell lines that were rendered resistant to the purine
analog PU-H71, we identified two genetic alterations that
allowed adaptation to HSP90 inhibition.
First, MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells restored
HSP90 function in the presence of PU-H71 through an
HSP90α Y142N mutation affecting the N-terminal ATPbinding pocket of HSP90α, which was accompanied by
amplification and overexpression of the HSP90AA1 locus.
We hypothesize that the aberrant asparagine at position
142 disrupts the physiological interaction of Y142
and S164, thereby reducing the binding of PU-H71 to
HSP90 without affecting the chaperone function and ATP
hydrolysis. This prediction is supported by our observation
that HSP90α Y142N can bind to ATP as efficiently as
wildtype HSP90α, whereas the binding to geldanamycin
is severely hampered. Along the same lines, the fungus H.
fuscoatra, which produces the HSP90-inhibiting antibiotic
radicicol, harbors a cytosolic HSP90 variant with mutation
of a conserved amino acid in the N-terminal domain that
confers resistance to radicicol without compromising ATP
binding and hydrolysis [40]. Despite the same binding
capacity of HSP90α Y142N and wildtype HSP90α to ATP,
it is also plausible that HSP90α Y142N is slightly less
efficient in ATP hydrolysis than the wildtype chaperone,
but the high levels of HSP90α Y142N might compensate
for its reduced functionality and allow MDA-MB-231-R
cells to thrive in high PU-H71 concentrations. Importantly,
the influence of HSP90α Y142N on the binding to HSP90
seems to vary among structurally different inhibitors,
since MD-MB-231-R cells were cross-resistant to
tanespimycin, whereas ganetespib was partially effective.
In addition, mere overexpression of HSP90 might also
induce resistance to HSP90 inhibition, as indicated by

our finding that the viability of PU-H71-treated cells is
partially rescued by exogenous HSP90α expression. It has
been reported that elevated HSP90 levels buffer cancer
cells from the increased proteotoxic stress associated
with aneuploidy and are correlated with poor prognosis in
various cancers [41, 42]. Thus, high intrinsic or acquired
HSP90 expression could provide protection against HSP90
inhibitors independent of mutations that alter HSP90
structure and/or conformation.
Second, we identified amplification of the ABCB1
gene and subsequent overexpression of the drug efflux
pump MDR1 as the cause of acquired PU-H71 resistance
in A549 lung cancer cells and SW480 colon cancer cells.
The short time of about eight weeks that were necessary to
obtain the resistant cell lines suggests that cells harboring
a pre-existing ABCB1 amplification were selected for by
PU-H71 treatment, whereas the acquisition of a novel
genetic alteration and subsequent clonal outgrowth of
mutant cells would be expected to take longer, as observed
with MDA-MB-231 cells that required six months to
become resistant. This hypothesis is supported by the
finding that cross-resistance to puromycin (another MDR1
substrate [43]) occurred again when we re-generated PUH71-resistant A549 and SW480 cells (data not shown). Of
note, overexpression of MDR1 has been shown previously
to confer resistance to the structurally related inhibitors
tanespimycin, geldanamycin and alvespimycin in cancer
cell lines [44, 45]. Our data support these findings, but also
indicate that ganetespib might not be substrate of MDR1.
MDR1 efficiently excludes many, structurally
diverse compounds from cells, including various
chemotherapeutic drugs, and MDR1 overexpression has
been implicated in resistance to conventional cytotoxics
as well as targeted agents [27, 28]. Also, a recent

study showed that in nearly 8% of high-grade serous
ovarian cancers with acquired resistance to paclitaxel,
translocations and inversions of the 5ʹ regulatory region of
the ABCB1 gene lead to MDR1 overexpression compared
to patient-matched, paclitaxel-sensitive primary tumors
[46]. Given that the majority of ongoing clinical trials with
HSP90 inhibitors are conducted in patients with advanced
malignancies, they might underestimate the efficacy of
these drugs due to frequent MDR1 overexpression in
cancers that have failed previous treatment. Furthermore,
measurement of MDR1 expression before and during
HSP90 inhibitor administration may enable enrichment
of trial cohorts for patients more likely to respond, and
guide development of rational combination therapies.
For example, MDR1-overexpressing SW480-R cells
show resistance to both PU-H71 and tanespimycin but
are sensitive to ganetespib, illustrating that knowledge of
MDR1 expression may aid in selecting a specific HSP90
inhibitor. Finally, despite the mixed outcomes of phase
3 clinical trials with MDR1 inhibitors, mostly due to
high toxicity in combination with cytotoxic agents, coadministration of PU-H71 and new-generation MDR1
inhibitors may be feasible given the high affinity of PUH71 for active HSP90 [31, 32] and its specific targeting
of complexes comprised of HSP90 and oncogenic fusion
proteins in certain cancers [47].
Taken together, our data identify potential
mechanisms of resistance to pharmacologic HSP90
blockade that can aid in patient selection and guide the
development of additional HSP90 inhibitors or rational
combination therapies.

reading frames were cloned into the pLenti6.2/V5-DEST
lentiviral expression vector using Gateway Technology
(Invitrogen). RNA interference experiments were performed
using pLKO.1 lentiviral short hairpin RNA (shRNA)
vectors from the TRC-Hs 1.0 (Human) shRNA library:
shHSP90AA1_1, TRCN0000001025; shHSP90AB1_1,
TRCN0000008748; shABCB1_1, TRCN0000059685;
shABCB1_2, TRCN0000059687. Generation of viral
supernatants and viral transduction were performed as
previously described [16].

Western blot and pull-down analyses
Whole-cell protein lysates were generated and
analyzed by western blotting as described before [18].
Whole-cell protein extracts for HSP90 pull-down with
geldanamycin were prepared with lysis buffer containing
50 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton-X100,
protease and phosphatase inhibitors. Lysates (250 μg)
were incubated with 40 μg geldanamycin-biotin (SigmaAldrich) and 125 μl settled NeutrAvidin Agarose Resin
(Thermo Scientific) at 4°C. Immobilized proteins were
washed three times, resuspended in Laemmli buffer and
subjected to SDS-PAGE and western blotting. The HSP90
pull-down with ATP beads was performed using the Pierce
Kinase Enrichment Kit with ATP Probe (Thermo Scientific)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The following
antibodies were used: anti-β-actin (Sigma-Aldrich), antiRAF1 (#9422, Cell Signaling), anti-AKT1 (2H10, Cell
Signaling), anti-STK33 (4F7, Abnova), anti-HSP90β (D19, Santa Cruz), anti-HSP90α (AB3466, Millipore) and
anti-p-glycoprotein (anti-ABCB1) (C219, Millipore).

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Sequencing of HSP90AA1 and HSP90AB1

Cell lines and inhibitors

Genomic DNA was isolated from PU-H71-sensitive
or resistant cell lines using the PureLink Genomic DNA
Mini Kit (Invitrogen). HSP90AA1 and HSP90AB1 coding
exons were amplified using previously described primers
[48] and standard PCR conditions with adjustments for
annealing temperature and extension time, and amplified
fragments were subjected to direct Sanger sequencing.
Chromatogram sequence alignment of HSP90AA1 was
performed using MacVector 13.5.5.

All cell lines were obtained from ATCC and
maintained under standard conditions. Cell line identity
and purity were verified using the Multiplex Cell
Authentication and Contamination Tests (Multiplexion).
PU-H71 was generated and provided by the laboratory of
G. Chiosis as previously described [47]. Puromycin was
obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Ganetespib, tanespimycin
and tariquidar were purchased from Selleck. From each
PU-H71-resistant cell line, three to five clones were
generated by seeding single cells into 96-well plates.

Cell viability and proliferation assays
To evaluate the effects of drug treatment or shRNA
knockdown, 2,000 cells per well were plated in 96-well
plates with indicated drug concentrations or five days post
lentiviral transduction, respectively, and cell viability and
proliferation were analyzed after two to four days using
the CellTiter 96AQueous One Solution Proliferation Assay
(Promega). Cell viability was also assessed by trypan
blue exclusion using a Vi-CELL Cell Viability Analyzer
(Beckman Coulter). For this assay, 100,000 cells per well

Constructs and lentiviral transduction
The HSP90AA1 cDNA was obtained from Open
Biosystems. To generate the p.Y142N mutant, a c.T464A
mutation was introduced in exon 3 of HSP90AA1 (NCBI
accession AJ890083 and NP_005339.3) using the
QuikChange XL Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene),
and the presence of the mutation was confirmed by Sanger
sequencing. The wildtype and mutant HSP90AA1 open

Gene expression profiling and single-nucleotide
polymorphism array analysis
Gene expression profiling and single-nucleotide
polymorphism (SNP) array analysis were performed
as previously reported [49]. In brief, total RNA was
isolated from PU-H71-sensitive and resistant clones using
the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen), and gene expression was
profiled using GeneChip Human Genome U133 Plus
2.0 Arrays (Affymetrix) according to the manufacturer’s
recommendations. The complete microarray dataset is
available at the Gene Expression Omnibus (http://www.ncbi.
nlm.nih.gov/projects/geo; accession number GSE85734).
Genomic DNA was isolated from bulk PU-H71-sensitive
and resistant lines using the PureLink Genomic DNA Mini
Kit (Invitrogen), and genomic profiling was performed
with Genome-Wide Human SNP Arrays 6.0 (Affymetrix)
according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. After
generation of raw data (CEL files) using the Genotyping
Command Console version 2.0 (Affymetrix), paired analysis
of PU-H71-sensitive and resistant samples was performed
as previously reported [50]. The complete SNP array dataset
is available at the Gene Expression Omnibus (accession
number GSE85734).
