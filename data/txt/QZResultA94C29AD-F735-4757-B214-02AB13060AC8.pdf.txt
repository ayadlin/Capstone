ABSTRACT
The human malignant mesothelioma (HMM) is characterized by a chemoresistant
and immunosuppressive phenotype. An effective strategy to restore chemosensitivity
and immune reactivity against HMM is lacking. We investigated whether the use of
zoledronic acid is an effective chemo-immunosensitizing strategy.
We compared primary HMM samples with non-transformed mesothelial cells.
HMM cells had higher rate of cholesterol and isoprenoid synthesis, constitutive
activation of Ras/extracellular signal-regulated kinase1/2 (ERK1/2)/hypoxia
inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) pathway and up-regulation of the drug efflux transporter
P-glycoprotein (Pgp). By decreasing the isoprenoid supply, zoledronic acid downregulated the Ras/ERK1/2/HIF-1α/Pgp axis and chemosensitized the HMM cells to
Pgp substrates. The HMM cells also produced higher amounts of kynurenine, decreased
the proliferation of T-lymphocytes and expanded the number of T-regulatory (Treg)
cells. Kynurenine synthesis was due to the transcription of the indoleamine 1,2
dioxygenase (IDO) enzyme, consequent to the activation of the signal transducer
and activator of transcription-3 (STAT3). By reducing the activity of the Ras/ERK1/2/
STAT3/IDO axis, zoledronic acid lowered the kyurenine synthesis and the expansion
of Treg cells, and increased the proliferation of T-lymphocytes.
Thanks to its ability to decrease Ras/ERK1/2 activity, which is responsible
for both Pgp-mediated chemoresistance and IDO-mediated immunosuppression,
zoledronic acid is an effective chemo-immunosensitizing agent in HMM cells.

mTOR), histone deacetylase and proteasome [2–4] -,
employing gene therapy [5] or immunotherapy [3, 6, 7],
are ongoing. These approaches however do not offer
significant advantages in terms of patients’ outcome,
and chemotherapy is still the most common therapeutic
approach. The first-line chemotherapy is based on platinum
salts and antifolates (such as pemetrexed or ralitrexed) [3];
multiple combinations of drugs, including mitomycin C,
Vinca alkaloids, gemcitabine, anthracyclines, irinotecan
[2], have been experimented as second-line treatments, with
poor success.

INTRODUCTION
Human malignant mesothelioma (HMM) is an
asbestos-related tumor with a progressively increasing
incidence in the next 10 years. The current therapy is based
on pleuro-pneumonectomy, neo-adjuvant and/or adjuvant
chemotherapy, radiotherapy [1]. The prognosis is poor
and the overall survival is less than 1 year. Small phase I/
II trials using targeted therapy - e.g. inhibitors of vascular
endothelial growth factor receptor, phosphatidylinositol
3-kinase/mammalian target of rapamycin (PI3K/

The main reasons of the chemotherapy failure
include the scanty drug delivery within pleural tissue
and the chemoresistance, which occurs in up to 60% of
the HMM patients at the diagnosis [8]. The activation
of PI3K/Akt/mTOR [9, 10], osteopontin/Akt [11],
macrophage colony stimulating factor-1 receptor/
Akt [12], Mcl-1/Bcl-xL [13], senescence-associated
secretory phenotype/signal transducer and activator
of transcription-3 (STAT3) [14] pathways, and the
presence of the ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporters
P-glycoprotein (Pgp), multidrug resistance related proteins
(MRPs) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) [10,
15–17], have been correlated with HMM chemoresistance.
Pgp has the broadest spectrum of substrates, which
include anthracyclines, taxanes, Vinca alkaloids,
epipodophyllotoxins, topotecan, methotrexate, imatinib,
dasatinib, lapatinib, gefitinib, sorafenib, erlotinib [18].
The second issue that makes HMM hard to eradicate
is the tumor-induced immunosuppression [7], mainly due to
the release of specific cytokines increasing the percentage
of immunosuppressive regulatory T-cells (Tregs) [19],
myeloid-derived suppressor cells, type 2-tumor associated
macrophages (TAMs), which suppress the proliferation and
effector functions of T-lymphocytes [7].
One of the strongest mediators of tumor-induced
immunosuppression is kynurenine, a tryptophan catabolite
produced by indoleamine 1,2 dioxygenase (IDO) [20]. The
role of kynurenine in HMM has not yet been investigated.
The “ideal” therapy of HMM should improve the
efficacy of chemotherapy and recover the immunosuppression
induced by the HMM cells themselves.
Recently we demonstrated that the aminobisphos­
phonate zoledronic acid overcomes the resistance
to doxorubicin by reducing the activity of Ras/
extracellular signal-regulated kinase1/2 (ERK1/2)/
hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α)/Pgp axis, and
restores a proper recognition by the host immune

system in chemo-immunoresistant solid tumors [21].
Zoledronic acid is known to reduce HMM growth [22],
induce apoptosis [23], up-regulate p53 [24], impair the
polarization of TAMs towards type 2-phenotype, reduce
the synthesis of immunosuppressive cytokines [25].
In this work we investigated whether the use of
zoledronic acid is an effective chemo-immunosensitizing
strategy in primary HMMs, thus fulfilling two
requirements of the “ideal” therapy of HMM.

RESULTS
Zoledronic acid chemosensitizes mesothelioma
cells by down-regulating the Ras/ERK1/2/
HIF-1α/Pgp axis
Samples from ten HMM patients, whose
demographic and histological features are reported in
Table 1, were analyzed for the sensitivity to different
chemotherapeutic drugs, unrelated for chemical structure
and activity: irrespectively of the patients’ clinical
and histological features, the half maximal inhibitory
concentration (IC50) for each drug (Table 2) and the
resistance factor (Rf; Table 3) were significantly higher
than in non-transformed human mesothelial cells (HMC).
All HMM samples expressed Pgp, MRP1 and
MRP3, and showed variable amounts of MRP4, MRP5,
BCRP; such ABC transporters were undetectable in HMC
(Supplementary Figure 1). In the subsequent experiments, all
the 10 samples (indicated as HMM cells) were investigated,
but in blotting experiments, for sake of simplicity, we show
four out of the ten samples, including one sarcomatous, two
epithelioid (one SV-40-negative and one SV-40-positive) and
one biphasic histotypes. However, no significant differences
in the parameters examined were observed as a function of
the histotype (see below). Compared to the HMC, the HMM

cells had higher cholesterol and farnesyl pyrophosphate
(FPP) synthesis (Figure 1a), and showed higher levels of
GTP-bound Ras (Figure 1b), phosphorylation (Figure 1b)
and activity (Figure 1c) of the Ras downstream effectors
ERK1/2. In HMM cells, but not in HMC, the transcription
factor HIF-1α, a known inducer of Pgp and a target of Ras/
ERK1/2 axis [21], was phosphorylated on serine (Figure 1d),
translocated in the nucleus (Figure 1e) and bound to the
target DNA (Figure 1f). By inhibiting the FPP synthase [26]

and reducing the FPP supply (Figure 1a) necessary for Ras,
zoledronic acid significantly lowered the activation of Ras,
ERK1/2 and HIF-1α (Figures 1b–f).
HIF-1α was constitutively bound to the promoter
of MDR1 gene, which encodes for Pgp, in HMM
cells (Figure 2a) that – differently from HMC – were
characterized by constitutively detectable levels of Pgp
protein (Figure  2b). Zoledronic acid reduced the binding
of HIF-1α to the MDR1 promoter (Figure 2a) and the

expression of Pgp (Figure 2b). Consequently, it lowered
the IC50 of chemotherapeutic drugs that are substrates
of Pgp (Supplementary Table 1), such as doxorubicin,
vinblastine and etoposide (Figure 2c). By contrast,
zoledronic acid did not affect the IC50 of cisplatin,
gemcitabine and pemetrexed (Figure 2c) that are not
effluxed by Pgp (Supplementary Table 1).
The mean IC50 of zoledronic acid alone in
HMM samples was 96.3 ± 8.7 μmol/L, nearly 100-fold
higher than the concentration (1 μmol/L) used in all
our experiments. Such difference led to exclude that
zoledronic acid exerts a cytotoxic effect in HMM cells at
the concentration used in the present work.
The combination index (CI) of 1 μmol/L zoledronic
acid and different concentrations (from 1 pmol/L to
1 mmol/L) of chemotherapeutic drugs is reported in
the Supplementary Table 2 and in the Supplementary
Figure 2: whereas for most concentrations of doxorubicin,
vinblastine and etoposide the effect of zoledronic acid
was synergistic, for most concentrations of cisplatin,
gemcitabine and pemetrexed the effect was additive
(Supplementary Figure 2). Focusing on the concentrations
around the IC50 of each chemotherapeutic drug in
the presence of zoledronic acid, we found that the
aminobisphosphonate produced clear synergistic effects
in the case of doxorubicin, vinblastine and etoposide,
additive effects or even slightly antagonistic effects
in the case of cisplatin, gemcitabine and pemetrexed
(Supplementary Table 2).
As shown in the Supplementary Table 1, ABC
transporters other than Pgp mediate the resistance towards
cisplatin, gemcitabine and pemetrexed. Differently
from what observed on Pgp levels, zoledronic acid
did not reduce the expression of MRP1, MRP2, MRP4
and MRP5 (Supplementary Figure 3a), the transporters
involved in the efflux of cisplatin, gemcitabine and
pemetrexed (Supplementary Table 1). The amount of
cisplatin, gemcitabine and pemetrexed retained within
HMM cells was sufficient to exert the typical anti-tumor
actions of these drugs. Cisplatin induced DNA damage
(Supplementary Figure 3b). Gemcitabine impaired the
cell cycle progression by increasing the percentage
of apoptotic cells and of cells blocked in S-phase, thus
inducing a mitotic catastrophe (Supplementary Figure 3c).
Pemetrexed inhibited the target enzyme dihydrofolate
reductase (DHFR; Supplementary Figure  3d). As to
all these parameters, however, zoledronic acid did
not enhance the anti-tumor effects induced by the
chemotherapeutic drugs (Supplementary Figure 3b–d).

kynurenine, higher levels of IDO mRNA and protein than
HMC, all reduced by zoledronic acid (Figures 3a–b).
Moreover,
HMC
stimulated T-lymphocyte
proliferation more than HMM cells, but zoledronic
acid-treated HMM cells significantly increased T-cell
proliferation (Figure 3c). The percentages of CD3+
T-cells, CD4+ T-helper cells, CD8+ T-cytotoxic cells did
not differ between HMC and HMM cells, both with or
without zoledronic acid (Supplementary Figure 4a–c).
Interestingly, the HMM cells expanded the number
of Tregs, and zoledronic acid counteracted this event
(Figure 3d). The IDO inhibitor 5-Br-brassinin [27], which
actually decreased the activity of IDO in HMM cells
(Supplementary Figure 5a), caused a response similar to
zoledronic acid (Supplementary Figure 5b–c), suggesting
that high kynurenine levels were accompanied by reduced
T-lymphocyte proliferation and higher Tregs expansion,
whereas low kynurenine levels – induced by zoledronic acid
or 5-Br-brassinin – were paralleled by an opposite scenario.
The transcriptional activators of the IDO gene
STAT1 and STAT3 [28, 29] were present in HMM cells and
constitutively translocated in the nucleus (Figure  4a). To
investigate their involvement in the transcription of IDO,
STAT1 and STAT3 were separately silenced in two primary
HMM samples (one epithelioid and one sarcomatous;
Figure 4a). STAT3-, but not STAT1-silenced cells showed
decreased IDO mRNA (Figure 4b) and activity (Figure 4c).
The phosphorylation of STATs on tyrosine [30] and
serine [31, 32] is critical for their transcriptional activity.
In HMM cells STAT1 was constitutively phosphorylated
on tyrosine 701 and serine 727, STAT3 was constitutively
phosphorylated on tyrosine 705 and serine 727 (Figure 4d).
Zoledronic acid specifically reduced the phosphorylation
of STAT3 on serine 727 (Figure 4d).
Since Ras/ERK1/2 axis is involved in the serine
phosphorylation of STAT3 [33, 34], we next investigated
whether the zoledronic acid’s effect was mediated by
the down-regulation of Ras and ERK1/2 activity. To this
aim, we produced two HMM clones (one epithelioid and
one sarcomatous) stably and inducibly silenced for Ras:
both clones showed decreased expression of Ras and
phosphorylation of ERK1/2 (Figure 5a). The same clones
were also incubated with the ERK1/2 inhibitor PD98059,
used as second tool to block the Ras/ERK1/2 pathway.
Compared to parental cells, both Ras-silenced and PD98059treated cells showed lower ERK activity (Figure 5b),
reduced levels of phospho(Ser727)-STAT3 without changes
in phospho(Tyr705)-STAT3 or total STAT3 (Figure 5c),
lower IDO activity and mRNA (Figure 5d), reproducing the
situation observed in HMM cells treated with zoledronic acid.

DISCUSSION
In this work we found that the aminobisphosphonate
zoledronic acid reverses chemoresistance and
immunosuppression of HMM cells.

1 μmol/L zoledronic acid (ZA) for 48 h, then subjected to the following investigations. (a) The kynurenine level in cells culture supernatant,
taken as an index of IDO enzymatic activity, was measured fluorimetrically (open bars, act); the expression levels of IDO mRNA were
measured by qRT-PCR (solid bars, mRNA). Data are presented as means ± SD (n = 4). Vs untreated (-) cells: *p < 0.01; HMM cells vs
HMC: °p < 0.002. (b) The cells were lysed and subjected to Western blot analysis for IDO expression. The β-tubulin expression was used
as control of equal protein loading. The figure is representative of 3 experiments with similar results. (c) The proliferation of activated
T-lymphocytes collected from PBMC after a 72 h co-incubation with HMC and HMM cells, grown in fresh medium (-) or in medium
containing 1 μmol/L ZA, was measured with the [3H]thymidine assay. As positive control of proliferation, the PBMC were treated with
the anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies, in the absence of cells; as negative control, the PBMC were grown in RPMI-1640 medium, in the
absence of anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies, and of cells. In the presence of the anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 stimulatory antibodies, the [3H]
thymidine incorporation was 33,123 ± 3,256 cpm; in the presence of RPMI-1640 medium alone, the [3H]thymidine incorporation was 3,892
± 297 cpm. The [3H]thymidine incorporation in HMC and HMM cells were: 480 ± 190 cpm (untreated HMC); 482 ± 44 cpm (ZA-treated
HMC); 485 ± 277 cpm (untreated HMM cells); 289 ± 28 cpm (ZA-treated HMM cells). Data are presented as means ± SD (n = 3). HMM
cells vs HMC: *p < 0.01; ZA-treated HMM cells vs untreated (-) cells: °p < 0.05. (d) The percentage of Tregs (CD4+CD25+CD127low)
collected from PBMC, co-incubated as reported in c, was measured by flow cytometry. Data are presented as means ± SD (n = 3). HMM
cells vs HMC: *p < 0.02; ZA-treated HMM cells vs untreated (-) cells: °p < 0.05.

Since HMM patients vary for genetic aberrations,
histological features, absence or presence of prooncogenic factors, we collected a series of HMM primary
samples, homogeneous for the demographic features,
but different for the tumor histotype and etiology. One
epithelioid sample contained SV40 whole genome, which
has been related to a highly aggressive phenotype [35].
All samples had a multidrug resistant phenotype and
were significantly more chemoresistant than the nontransformed HMC, owing to the constitutive presence of
several ABC transporters.

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

As it occurs in other chemoresistant cells [21], the
HMM cells displayed a higher synthesis of cholesterol and
isoprenoid units like FPP, and a higher activity of Ras and
downstream effectors implicated in the chemoresistance
[21], compared to the chemosensitive HMC. Ras/ERK1/2
axis is a critical pro-oncogenic pathway in HMM [36]. It
has been reported that HMM cells silenced for ERK1/2 are
more sensitive to doxorubicin and have a lower expression
of Pgp [37]: our results provide an explanatory mechanism
for this observation, showing that Pgp transcription is
sustained by the Ras/ERK1/2/HIF-1α axis in this tumor.

Zoledronic acid, which inhibited the Ras/
ERK1/2/HIF-1α/Pgp pathway, induced an appreciable
chemosensitization of HMM cells. Such effect was

specifically linked to the decrease of Pgp. Zoledronic
acid indeed decreased the expression of Pgp, allowing
Pgp substrates – such as doxorubicin, vinblastine and

etoposide – to reach higher intracellular accumulation
and toxicity. On the other hand, we did not observe any
sensitization towards substrates of other ABC transporters,
such as cisplatin, gemcitabine and pemetrexed. This
can be due to the lack of down-regulation of the ABC
transporters that extrude these drugs, and/or to the lack
of effects on the classical cellular targets of cisplatin,
gemcitabine and pemetrexed. These factors may explain
the different pharmacological profile (i.e. synergistic

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

versus additive/antagonistic effects) between substrates
and non-substrates of Pgp in the presence of zoledronic
acid. Although Pgp substrates are not included in the firstline therapy of HMM, most of them are used in secondline protocols [2–4]: reducing the Pgp amount is important
to improve the therapeutic efficacy of either conventional
chemotherapeutic drugs or new targeted drugs effluxed
by this transporter [18]. The concentration of zoledronic
acid that we used was not toxic and was compatible with

1136

Oncotarget

the blood concentration observed in patients [38], making
zoledronic acid potentially applicable to clinical protocols
for HMM in association with chemotherapy.
Besides chemoresistance, the tumor-induced
immunosuppression makes HMM an aggressive
tumor. The role of the immunosuppressive metabolite
kynurenine, as well as the molecular pathways upregulating the kynurenine producing enzyme IDO,
has not been investigated in HMM. We found that
kynurenine production and IDO expression were
significantly higher in HMM cells than in HMC,
leading to hypothesize that the increase of IDO and the
immunosuppressive phenotype are associated with the
malignant transformation of mesothelium. The higher
IDO activity was paralleled by the reduced proliferation
of T-lymphocytes and by the increased expansion of
the immunosuppressive Tregs subpopulation. Of note,
zoledronic acid, which down-regulated IDO, restored
the proliferation of T-lymphocytes and decreased the
expansion of Tregs. The increased number of Tregs
has been previously related to the HMM-induced
immunosuppression [19, 39], but not to the production
of kynurenine. These data are the premise to our in
progress studies in immunocompetent animal models,
aimed at investigating whether kynurenine is the
actual responsible for the Tregs expansion and for the
mesothelioma-induced immunosuppression in vivo.
Since mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases may
activate STAT proteins [33, 34], which in turn induce IDO
transcription [28, 29], we next investigated if in HMM
cells – that exhibit a constitutively active Ras/ERK1/2
axis – IDO was induced by STAT activity and if zoledronic
acid interfered with it. Both STAT1 and STAT3 were
activated in untreated HMM cells, in line with previous
reports [40]. The transient silencing of STAT1 and STAT3
suggested that only the latter was the transcriptional
activator of IDO in HMM. Whereas Janus kinases-1 and -2
promote the phosphorylation of STAT3 on tyrosine, MAP
kinases induce the phosphorylation on serine [33]. STAT3
is a good substrate for ERK1/2 kinases [41], which promote
the transcriptional activity of STAT3 [42]. Zoledronic acid
reduced the phosphorylation of STAT3 on serine 727. Of
note, Ras-silenced and ERK1/2-inhibited HMM clones
showed decreased levels of phospho(Ser727)-STAT3,
IDO transcription and kynurenine synthesis. This pattern
reproduced the changes elicited by zoledronic acid,
suggesting that aminobisphosphonate counteracts the
HMM-induced production of kynurenine by inhibiting the
Ras/ERK1/2/STAT3 axis. The decrease of STAT3 activity
has been exploited in vitro and in vivo as a pro-apoptotic
strategy against HMM [43]. We suggest that lowering
the Ras/ERK1/2/STAT3 axis can be also an effective
immunosensitizing strategy.
In summary, we propose that the constitutively
active Ras/ERK1/2 axis may determine both the

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

chemoresistance and the immunosuppression observed
in HMM. By phosphorylating and activating HIF-1α, this
axis promotes the up-regulation of Pgp, which effluxes
several chemotherapeutic drugs. By phosphorylating and
activating STAT3, it favors the synthesis of kynurenine,
which is paralleled by the reduced proliferation of
T-lymphocytes and by the increased expansion of the
pro-immunosuppressive Tregs population. Thanks to its
ability to decrease isoprenoid synthesis and Ras/ERK1/2
activity, zoledronic acid reverses the chemoresistance
to Pgp substrates, lowers the kynurenine synthesis and
the Tregs proliferation, and restores the proliferation of
T-lymphocytes co-cultured with HMM cells (Figure 6).
By overcoming the main defects of HMM
therapy – i.e. the poor efficacy of chemotherapy and the
tumor-induced immunosuppression – zoledronic acid
may represent a promising adjuvant drug for the future
treatment protocols of HMM.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Chemicals
The plasticware for cell cultures was from Falcon
(Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ). Zoledronic
acid was a gift from Novartis (Basel, Switzerland).
Doxorubicin,
vinblastine,
etoposide,
cisplatin,
gemcitabine, pemetrexed, mitoxantrone, PD98059 were
purchased from Sigma Chemicals Co. (St. Louis, MO).
The electrophoresis reagents were obtained from BioRad Laboratories (Hercules, CA). The protein content of
cell lysates was assessed with the BCA kit from Sigma
Chemicals Co. When not otherwise specified, all the other
reagents were purchased from Sigma Chemicals Co.

Cells
The non-transformed HMC were isolated from
three patients with transudative pleural fluid due to
congestive heart failure, with no history of malignant
disease. The mesothelial origin of the isolated cells was
confirmed by the positive immunostaining with anticytokeratins 8 and 18 (Becton Dickinson), anti-vimentin
(Dako, Glostrup, Denmark), anti-mesothelial cell (Dako)
antibodies. The primary HMM cells were collected from
the Biologic Bank of Malignant Mesothelioma, S.S.
Antonio e Biagio Hospital, Alessandria, Italy, where the
histological characterization was performed. One sample,
already described in [35], was positive for SV40 virus.
The samples, collected after informed written consent,
were indicated with an “Unknown Patient Number”
(UPN) in the manuscript. The experimental protocol was
approved by the Bioethics Committee (“Comitato Etico
Interaziendale”) of the S.S. Antonio e Biagio Hospital,
Alessandria, Italy.

Figure 6: Zoledronic acid induces chemo-immunosensitization in mesothelioma cells by downregulating the Ras/
ERK1/2/HIF-1α/Pgp and Ras/ERK1/2/STAT3/IDO axes. HMM cells have the Ras small GTPase (Ras GTP) and the downstream

effectors ERK1/2 kinases (pERK1/2) in a constitutively active form. ERK1/2 kinases phosphorylate on serine the transcription factor HIF-1α
(pHIF1α), which is primed to translocate in the nucleus and to increase the transcription of the MDR1 gene, which is translated into
Pgp, an efflux transporter of chemotherapeutic drugs (D). Moreover, ERK1/2 kinases phosphorylate STAT3 (pSerSTAT3) that activates
the transcription of the IDO gene. The increase of kynurenine (K), a product of IDO activity during the catabolism of tryptophan (T), is
paralleled by the decreased T-lymphocyte proliferation and by the increased expansion of the immunosuppressive Tregs subpopulation.
These events may confer to mesothelioma a chemoresistant and immunosuppressive phenotype. By inhibiting the FPP synthase (FPPS)
and then reducing the supply of FPP necessary to activate Ras, zoledronic acid (ZA) inhibits both the Ras/ERK1/2/HIF-1α/Pgp and the
Ras/ERK1/2/STAT3/IDO axes, thus potentially inducing chemo-immunosensitization. Green arrow: stimulation; red line: inhibition; blue

β-tubulin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.). The proteins
were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (BioRad Laboratories). HIF-1α phosphorylation and nuclear
translocation were measured as reported previously
[21], using an anti-TATA-box binding protein (TBP)
antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.) as a control
of equal nuclear protein loading. To exclude any
cytosolic contamination of nuclear extracts, we verified
that β-tubulin was undetectable in nuclear samples (not
shown).

Cell viability
100,000 cells were seeded in 96-well plates,
treated for 48 h with chemotherapeutic agents at scalar
concentrations (from 1 pmol/L to 1 mmol/L), then
stained with neutral red solution as described [44]. The
IC50, i.e. the concentration of each drug that decreased
the cell viability by 50%, was calculated with the
CompuSyn software (http://www.combosyn.com). The
Rf was calculated by dividing the IC50 of each drug
in HMM cells for the IC50 of each drug in HMC. The
synergistic, additive or antagonistic effect of the different
concentrations of chemotherapeutic drugs in the presence
of 1 μmol/L zoledronic acid was calculated with the
CI equation of Chou-Talalay [45], using the CompuSyn
software.

ERK, HIF-1 and DHFR activity
The ERK activity in whole cell lysates and the
HIF-1 activity in nuclear extracts were measured with
the MAP kinase (ERK1/2) Activity Assay kit (Millipore)
and with the TransAM™ HIF-1 Transcription Factor
Assay Kit (Active Motif, La Hulpe, Belgium), following
the manufacturer’s instructions. The activity of DHFR, a
target enzyme of pemetrexed [47], was measured in whole
cell lysates using the Dihydrofolate Reductase Assay kit
(Sigma Chemical Co.), following the manufacturer’s
instructions. The data were expressed as units/mg proteins.

Mevalonate pathway activity
The cells were labeled with 1 μCi/mL [3H]acetate
(3600 mCi/mmol; Amersham Bioscience, Piscataway, NJ).
The synthesis of radiolabeled cholesterol and FPP was
measured as described [21].

Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)

Ras activation assay

ChIP experiments to measure the binding of HIF1α to the hypoxia responsive element of the promoter of
MDR1 were performed as previously reported [48].

The GTP-bound Ras fraction, taken as an index of
active G-proteins [46], was measured as reported [21].

Comet assay

Western blotting

The genotoxic damages, taken as indexes of
cisplatin activity, were evaluated by the Single Cell
Gel Electrophoresis assay (Comet assay), as reported
previously [49]. Images were quantified by the
CometScore software (TriTek Corp., Sumerduck, VA).

The cells were lysed in MLB buffer (125 mmol/L
Tris-HCl, 750 mmol/L NaCl, 1% v/v NP40, 10% v/v
glycerol, 50 mmol/L MgCl2, 5 mmol/L EDTA, 25

10 μg/mL pepstatin, 10 μg/mL aprotinin, 1 mmol/L
phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.5), sonicated and
centrifuged at 13,000 x g for 10 min at 4°C. 20 μg of
proteins from cell lysates were subjected to Western
blotting and probed with the following antibodies:
phospho(Thr202/Tyr204,
Thr185/Tyr187)-ERK1/2
(Millipore, Billerica, MA); ERK 1/2 (Millipore); HIF1α (BD Bioscience, San Jose, CA); Pgp/ABCB1 (Santa

Cell cycle analysis
The cell cycle distribution was analyzed as a
parameter of gemcitabine efficacy [50]. Cells were washed
twice with fresh PBS, incubated in 0.5 mL ice-cold ethanol
70% v/v for 15 min, then centrifuged at 1,200 x g for 5 min
at 4oC and rinsed with 0.3 mL of citrate buffer (50 mmol/L
Na2HPO4, 25 mmol/L sodium citrate, 1% v/v Triton X-100),
containing 10 μg/mL propidium iodide and 1 mg/mL
RNAse (from bovine pancreas). After a 15 min incubation
in the dark, the intracellular fluorescence was detected by a
FACSCalibur flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson). For each
analysis, 10,000 events were collected and analyzed by the
Cell QuestPro software (Becton Dickinson).

IDO activity

19–25 nucleotide non-targeting scrambled siRNAs, with
a STAT1- or STAT3-specific siRNAs pool (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology Inc.). To produce HMM clones stably and
inducibly silenced for Ras, 50,000 cells were transduced
with 2.5 μg TetOn pTRIPZ vector containing a specific
shRNA for RAS (Thermo Scientific), then selected in
medium containing 1 μg/mL puromycin. RAS shRNA
was induced by adding 1 μg/mL doxycycline for 24 h.
To verify the silencing efficacy, the cells were lysed and
checked for the expression of STAT1, STAT3 or Ras by
Western blotting, as described above.

The IDO activity was determined as previously
characterized [51].

Quantitative real time-PCR (qRT-PCR)
Total RNA was reverse-transcribed using the
iScriptTM cDNA Synthesis Kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories).
The qRT-PCR was performed with the iTaqTM Universal
SYBR® Green Supermix (Bio-Rad Laboratories). The
primer sequences were designed with the qPrimerDepot
software (http://primerdepot.nci.nih.gov/). The relative
quantification was performed by comparing each PCR
product with the housekeeping PCR product (β-actin),
using the Bio-Rad Software Gene Expression Quantitation
(Bio-Rad Laboratories).

Statistical analysis
All data in text and figures are provided as means ± SD.
The results were analyzed by a one-way analysis of variance

ACKNOWLEDGEMENT

1 × 106/mL human peripheral blood mononuclear
cells (PBMC), isolated from buffy coats of healthy donors
(kindly provided by Blood Bank, Città della Salute
e della Scienza di Torino Hospital, Torino, Italy) by
centrifugation on Ficoll-Hypaque density gradient, were
treated with anti-CD3 (OKT3, BioLegend, San Diego,
CA) and anti-CD28 (BioLegend) antibodies, to induce the
specific proliferation of T-lymphocytes. Then, cells were
co-cultured for 72 h with HMC or HMM cells, previously
irradiated with 30 Gy for 15 min, at an effector/target
cells ratio of 10:1. The expansion of T-lymphocytes,
the only PBMC population able to proliferate in these
experimental conditions, was assessed by adding 1 μCi of
[3H]thymidine (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA) 18 h before
the end of the co-cultures, then harvesting the plates and
counting the radioactivity. To analyze the lymphocyte
phenotype after the incubation with tumor cells, the
cells were harvested, washed and re-suspended in PBS
containing 5% v/v FBS. A 3- and 4-color flow cytometry
analysis was performed with the appropriate combinations
of fluorescein isothiocyanate-, r-phycoerythrin-,
Tricolor-, Peridinin Chlorophyll Protein Complex- or
allophycocyanin-conjugated antibodies against CD3,
CD4, CD8, CD25 (all from Miltenyi Biotech, Bergisch
Gladbach, Germany) and CD127 (BioLegend). Isotype
controls were run for each sample. The samples were read
with a FACSCalibur flow cytometer equipped with Cell
QuestPro software (Becton Dickinson). The use of PBMC
from healthy donors and the experimental protocols were
approved by the Bioethics Committee (“Comitato Etico
Interaziendale”) of the Città della Salute e della Scienza
