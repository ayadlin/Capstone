BACKGROUND: Soft tissue sarcomas (STS) are relatively uncommon tumors. Data regarding the patterns
of care of patients with STS and its consistency with available guidelines are relatively sparse. The authors
conducted a detailed analysis of STS patients diagnosed in 2002 and sampled from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results registries. METHODS: The authors sampled 1369 patients with invasive sarcomas. Hospital records were reabstracted, and treating physicians were contacted to verify the therapy
provided to each patient. RESULTS: The median age of patients was 60 years. There was a slight male predominance among the patients with nongynecologic sarcomas. Fifty percent of the patients had localized
stage sarcoma. Most patients received surgery, but negative margins were obtained in only 50% of
patients. Complete resection was less frequent in patients 50 years old. Radiation therapy was used in
53% of patients with extremity sarcomas but in only 20% to 30% of the patients with sarcomas at other
sites. About 27% of all patients received chemotherapy. Tumor grade was significantly associated with the
use of radiation and chemotherapy. Surgical resection, tumor grade, tumor size, use of radiation therapy,
and age significantly influenced survival. CONCLUSIONS: Patterns of care of STS differ based on the site of
the tumor. The patterns of care for extremity sarcomas are fairly consistent with the available recommendations, but the patterns of care for other sites are less consistent. In addition to certain tumor characteristics, age of the patient was significantly associated with therapy and patient outcome. Cancer

KEY WORDS: soft tissue sarcomas, SEER, patterns of care.

Soft tissue sarcomas (STS) are uncommon cancers, representing <1% of all malignant neoplasms, with
an annual incidence of approximately 10,390 cases and about 3680 deaths per year.1 Management of these
tumors requires a multidisciplinary approach.
Guidelines for the management of STS have been published by different institutions, including the
National Comprehensive Cancer Network.2 Separate management guidelines have been provided for different anatomic sites.3 For extremity sarcomas, the guidelines recommend surgery for low-grade tumors,
with postoperative radiation recommended for tumors >5 cm. In high-grade tumors, radiation with or

without chemotherapy is recommended in addition to
optimal surgical resection. Limb salvage is considered an
important objective and generally guides treatment
decisions.
For nonextremity sarcomas, surgical resection is
considered the primary therapy. Postoperative radiation is
recommended in patients with high-grade sarcomas. In
unresectable tumors, multiple different approaches are
suggested, including observation, palliative surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy.
Management of STS can be challenging because of
differences in anatomic sites and the rarity of the tumors.
Treatment is provided by physicians from different disciplines, increasing the variability in therapy. Data regarding patterns of care of STS from the United States are
relatively sparse,4-7 and most data are from case series
from major cancer centers with expertise in treating sarcomas.8-11 These data sets may not reflect the general patterns of care. In addition, many of the reports have
presented analysis of all STS together or focused on extremity sarcomas.
We therefore conducted this analysis of STS patients
using data from a population-based sample of the patterns
of care study by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) to
determine the patterns of care and assess the outcomes of
these patients by anatomic site.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
The NCI’s Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results
(SEER) is a population-based cancer registry system that
collects comprehensive information on demographics, tumor characteristics, and therapy and maintains follow-up
of patients for vital status on all cancers occurring in
defined geographic region. Because data collection is primarily conducted in hospitals, surgical centers, and radiation facilities, the systemic therapy information is
incomplete. The NCI annually conducts the patterns of
care studies to obtain detailed information on therapy for
selected cancers. In 2002 patients with invasive sarcoma,
histology codes 8800-8991, 9040-9044, were identified
by participating registries (the states of Connecticut,
Iowa, New Mexico, New Jersey, Utah, and Louisiana and
the metropolitan areas of San Francisco/Oakland, San
Jose/Monterey, Seattle/Puget Sound, Atlanta, Detroit,
Los Angeles County, and the remaining area of the State
Cancer

of California). Patients aged <20 years, diagnosed at autopsy or on the death certificate, or who had been previously diagnosed with cancer, other than nonmelanoma
skin cancer, were ineligible. The remaining patients were
stratified by registry, race/ethnicity, and sex, and a random sample of cases was selected. We oversampled nonHispanic black and Hispanic patients and selected all
cases of Asians, Pacific Islanders, American Indians, and
Alaskan Natives to obtain more stable estimates.
Medical records were reabstracted, and each
patient’s treating physician was asked to verify the therapy
given. The physicians were also asked to identify any other
provider who might have treated the patient. These providers were then contacted. A centralized training was provided for the individual at each registry who was primarily
responsible for conducting the study to ensure consistency
of abstracting and coding of data. A 5% sample of case
records were reabstracted for quality control. Comorbid
conditions documented in the hospital medical record at
the time of the most definitive therapy were recorded and
coded centrally by a single registered health information
technologist. The data were analyzed separately based on
tumor location, because this is known to influence
therapeutic recommendations.
Data analyses were performed using SAS and
SUDAAN (Research Triangle Institute, Research Triangle Park, NC) and were weighted to reflect the SEER population from which the data were obtained. We present
adjusted percentages of patients receiving radiation or
chemotherapy. Adjusted percentages were obtained from
the estimates of the probability for each individual receiving treatment in the logistic regression models. These percentages were directly standardized to the distribution of
the covariates among the entire weighted sample.12 Cancer-caused mortality was analyzed using Cox regression
models based on a follow-up through December 31,
2005. The statistical significance tests were assessed using
the Wald-type F statistics. All P values were 2-sided.

RESULTS
A total of 1369 patients were selected: 345 extremity sarcomas, 304 gynecologic sarcomas, and 720 sarcomas of
other sites (Table 1). The median age at diagnosis was 60
years. The tumor size was smaller in extremity sarcoma
patients. Patients with gynecologic sarcomas more often

more often treated with adjuvant radiation plus chemotherapy. More than half of the patients with tumors <5

therapy and chemotherapy were used more frequently in
patients with larger tumors. Patients with well or moderately well differentiated tumors were most often treated
with surgery alone (57%), although 39% had radiation in

more often had localized stage at diagnosis. Among
patients who underwent surgery, lymph node dissections
were performed in 4%, 24%, and 45% of patients with
extremity, all other sites, and gynecologic sarcomas,
respectively.

Therapy
Most patients had surgery (Table 2). Radiation therapy
was used more commonly in patients with sarcoma of the
extremities. Doxorubicin was the most commonly administered chemotherapeutic agent for patients with sarcoma
of the extremity and ifosfamide for gynecologic sarcoma,
whereas imatinib was given to slightly >10% of patients
with sarcomas of other sites.

Localized and Regional Stage
Gynecologic Sarcoma
Of patients with localized or regional gynecologic sarcomas, 56% with clear margins had no treatment beyond
surgery. Nearly 29% of patients with tumor at the margins received adjuvant radiation and chemotherapy.
Women with tumors >10 cm were more often given adjuvant chemotherapy or radiation therapy, but only 1% of
patients with large tumors received all 3 modalities. Striking differences were seen by tumor grade. More than 88%
of women with well or moderately well differentiated
tumors had surgery alone, compared with only 38%
patients with poorly or undifferentiated tumors.

Localized and Regional Stage Sarcoma

each of the sarcoma sites, patients with poorly or undifferentiated tumors were more likely to receive
chemotherapy.
We used multiple logistic regression analysis to
determine factors associated with radiation and chemotherapy by sarcoma site (Table 5). The grade of the tumor
was associated with the use of radiation therapy for all 3
sarcomas sites, whereas pathologic margin status and
depth of the tumor were not. Larger tumors were associated with less radiation use in patients with sarcomas of
other sites. Age of younger than 50 years was associated
with significantly less radiation use for patients with extremity sarcomas; however, the opposite was true for sarcoma of other sites.
Chemotherapy use in extremity sarcomas was associated with tumor depth, grade, age, and radiation. Women
with gynecologic sarcomas were given chemotherapy
more often if they had any residual tumor at the margins,
or large, poorly differentiated, or undifferentiated tumors.
Patients with sarcomas of other sites were treated with
chemotherapy more frequently if they did not have a surgical resection, or had large or poorly differentiated
tumors. A Charlson comorbidity score of 1 or more was
associated with less chemotherapy in patients with gynecologic sarcomas and sarcomas of other sites. Patients
with extremity sarcomas and sarcomas of other sites who
had radiation were more likely to receive chemotherapy.
Survival
The maximum follow-up on these patients was 47
months. Survival was associated with tumor size, grade,
pathologic margins, and age in all 3 sites of sarcomas
(Table 6). For all sites, not being able to undergo surgical
resection was associated with worse survival. Patients with
Cancer

June 15, 2009

tumors that were poorly differentiated or undifferentiated
had poor survival, as did patients aged 50 years or older.
Radiation therapy was associated with improved survival
in extremity and gynecologic sarcomas. However, chemotherapy use was not associated with decreased risk of cancer death.

DISCUSSION
This is the first study to examine treatment of sarcoma in
a large population-based data set. Grade and size of the tumor are recognized prognostic factors and are important
variables in determining the stage of STS. However, in
this dataset a high proportion of patients did not have the
grade or size of the tumor reported. This was particularly
true of gynecological sarcomas and sarcomas of other sites.
These data are similar to a report from the National Cancer Database on STS, which reported unknown grade in
>50% of the patients and unknown stage in >30% of the
patients.7 The same data set also reported a decline in the
percentage of patients with unknown grade from 1988 to
1993. It is possible that underreporting of grade and size
of tumor in STS in sites other than extremities has less
impact on therapeutic decisions than in extremity sarcoma. Lymph node metastases in STS are known to be
uncommon except for certain histologic subtypes such as
rhabdomyosarcomas, and lymph node sampling or dissection is not recommended. Lymph node assessment
occurred more frequently in gynecological sarcomas than
sarcomas of other sites.
In extremity sarcomas, 62% of patients underwent
surgery with complete resection. This is lower than the
complete resection rate of 80% reported in a series from a
single institution by Weitz et al.8 Limb salvage is an important objective of the management of extremity

time periods from 9% to 32%.8 Chemotherapy use in extremity sarcomas was significantly influenced by tumor
depth and tumor grade, as suggested by the guidelines.
Chemotherapy was also associated with higher use of radiation, probably reflective of the use of chemotherapy in
patients with adverse prognostic features. Data regarding
benefits of adjuvant chemotherapy in STS patients are disparate. Results of 2 recent trials evaluating the combination of an anthracycline and ifosfamide differ regarding
the benefits of adjuvant therapy.17,18 Previous meta-analCancer

ysis has suggested disease-free survival advantage from adjuvant chemotherapy, and the most recent meta-analysis
that included trials with ifosfamide-based regimens
showed both relapse-free and overall survival.19,20 The
guidelines do recommend consideration of adjuvant
chemotherapy, particularly in high-grade tumors. In
advanced disease, data demonstrating the benefits of
chemotherapy in STS are limited.21 The limited benefits
of adjuvant chemotherapy and the paucity of data regarding the benefits of chemotherapy in advanced stage STS

may have contributed to the limited use of chemotherapy
in these patients.
Age of the patient was significantly associated with
radiation and chemotherapy in extremity sarcomas, with
more radiation and less chemotherapy in older patients.
The lower use of chemotherapy in elderly patients may be
explained by concerns about chemotherapy, particularly
agents such as doxorubicin. However, the reasons for agebased disparity in the use of radiation are unclear. The
current guidelines do not distinguish therapeutic recommendations based on age of the patient. The number of
patients with STS who are older is expected to rise in the
coming years, with the aging of the population. It is therefore imperative that available options for systemic therapy
are applicable in the older patient population with STS.
Among patients with sarcomas of other sites, only
46% underwent complete resection, and 18% had no surgery. Case series reports of retroperitoneal and deep trunk
STS from different institutions report a negative margin
resection rate of about 45%.11,22 Surgical resection at sites
such as the retroperitoneum can be challenging because of
the proximity of the tumors to surrounding vital organs
and the large size of the tumors at diagnosis. Despite a
higher proportion of patients with sarcomas of other sites
not undergoing surgery, radiation was used only in 23% of
the patients. This lower use of radiation may also be related
to difficulty in delivering radiation at these sites compared
with the extremities, as suggested by the significantly lower
use of radiation in patients with larger tumors. Local
relapse rates are known to be higher in patients with sarcomas at other sites,22 probably because of limitations in
delivering local therapeutic modalities. Some reports have
suggested that preoperative radiation, at sites such as the
retroperitoneum, may be more feasible because of less toxicity.23,24 Intraoperative radiation has also been used in
patients with retroperitoneal sarcomas to improve efficacy
and reduce toxicity. However, the availability of such techniques is limited to specialized centers.
The percentage of patients with sarcomas at other
sites receiving chemotherapy is lower than that reported
in single institution case series.10,22 Chemotherapy use in
these patients was associated with poor prognostic features, such as lack of resection and larger tumor size. In
many patients, site and tumor size preclude surgery and
radiation, making chemotherapy the only therapeutic
option. In recent years, the introduction of imatinib
2752

mesylate has improved the outcomes of patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumors. However, the response to
chemotherapy in these sites is generally limited. Thus,
investigation of novel drugs for the management of these
tumors is necessary, because drug therapy may be the only
option in these patient.
Gynecological sarcomas were analyzed as a separate
category, because the location of the tumors and the
physicians involved in the care of these patients differ
from STS at other sites. Complete resection was achieved
in 53% of the patients, whereas 11% did not undergo
resection. The available literature regarding complete
resection of gynecological sarcomas is extremely limited;
therefore, we cannot determine whether this complete
resection rate is comparable to others. Thirty-one percent of gynecological sarcomas received radiation, a rate
similar to reports on uterine sarcomas from single institutions.25,26 The only factor that predicted use of radiation was tumor grade. Tumor margin status was not
significantly associated with radiation use. Adjuvant
radiation has been shown to reduce local recurrence in
retrospective reviews of uterine sarcomas and is recommended in resected patients. Data regarding use of
chemotherapy is also limited, although the guidelines do
recommend its use in patients with high-grade tumors
and metastatic disease. In this analysis, chemotherapy
use was associated with adverse prognostic features such
as residual tumor after surgery, larger tumors, and highgrade tumors.
Interpretation of the survival analysis is limited to
the available follow-up time for these patients. Surgical
resection, tumor size, and tumor grade were associated
with cancer-specific survival in each of the sites. These are
recognized prognostic factors for STS, although tumor
grade has not been consistently shown to be associated
with survival in sarcomas at sites other than the extremities.11,27 Age >50 years was also a significant factor in
cancer-related death for sarcomas at all sites. Patient age
has been reported as a factor for local control and diseasespecific survival in other series.9,16 Specific reasons for this
age-related difference in outcomes of patients with STS
are unclear. In this analysis, age did influence use of different treatment modalities and therefore may have resulted
in inferior survival in these patients.
Radiation was associated with improved survival in
patients with extremity and gynecological sarcomas.
Cancer

Previous results have shown that radiation does decrease
local recurrence but does not increase survival in extremity
sarcomas.13 However, patients with local recurrence are
known to be at a higher risk of developing distant metastases, an important cause of death. Therefore, improved
local control observed with radiation may influence longterm survival. The rate of complete resection in clinical
trials and in retrospective reviews from centers with expertise in treating sarcomas may be higher than the complete
resection rate in this analysis. It is possible that use of radiation may influence cancer-related survival in patients
who have less than adequate surgery, and therefore use of
radiation was associated with improved survival in this
analysis. Use of radiation did not influence survival in
patients with sarcomas at other sites.
There are certain limitations of these data. Although
SEER is an integration of population-based, quality-controlled registries that cover 26% of the US population, the
data from SEER are still only a sample of adult sarcoma
cases occurring in the United States. The SEER program
is comparable on measures of poverty and education, but
is slightly more urban and has more foreign-born individuals than the general US population. The registry does
contain all sarcomas occurring in a defined geographic
area, and therefore may better reflect the sarcoma patient
population than hospital-based registries, which are susceptible to referral patterns. We therefore believe that this
data set is a good reflection of the actual patterns of care of
sarcoma patients in the United States.
In summary, this analysis reveals that patterns of
care for STS differ significantly based on the site of the tumor. For extremity sarcomas, the patterns of care are fairly
consistent with the recommendations, but the patterns of
care in other sites are less consistent. In addition, age of
the patient was a significant factor in determining therapy
and outcome. Educational efforts directed toward adherence to management guidelines for physicians treating sarcoma might improve outcomes. Referral of patients
with sarcoma to centers of excellence with a multidisciplinary team might further improve outcomes of these
patients.
