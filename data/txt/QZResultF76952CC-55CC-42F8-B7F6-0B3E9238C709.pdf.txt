Abstract:

Senescence is a valid tumor suppressive mechanism in cancer. Accelerated
cell senescence describes the growth arrested state of cells that have been
treated with anti-tumor drugs, such as doxorubicin that induce a DNA damage
response. Discodermolide, a microtubule-stabilizing agent, is a potent inducer
of accelerated cell senescence. Resistance to discodermolide is mediated via
resistance to accelerated cell senescence, and is associated with reduced
expression of the mTORC1 substrate, 4E-BP1 and increased expression of p53 [1].
Although the association of p53 with senescence induction is well-characterized,
senescence reversion in the presence of high expression of p53 has not been
well-documented. Furthermore, studies addressing the role of mTOR signaling
in regulating senescence have been limited and recent data implicate a novel,
senescence-associated role for 4E-BP1 in crosstalk with the transcription factor
p53. This research perspective will address these somewhat contradictory findings
and summarize recent research regarding senescence and mTORC1 signaling.

Senescence

the DNA damage response and increased p53 stability,
which leads to transcription of pro-senescent genes such
as p21 (Figure 1). This increased stability is the result
of abrogation of the MDM2-p53 interaction. Murine
double minute 2, or MDM2, is an E3 ubiquitin ligase
and the major negative regulator of p53 [4]. In normal
cells, MDM2 is a transcriptional target of p53 creating a
negative feedback loop that maintains p53 at low levels,
but during stress, p53 escapes interaction with MDM2
and accumulates in the nucleus to initiate transcription of
target genes capable of inducing senescence.

Cellular senescence was first described in a study
examining the proliferative potential of diploid fibroblasts
that had been isolated from human fetal tissue. In this
study Hayflick and Moorehead described the restricted life
span of cells in culture [2]. Later, Hayflick hypothesized
that the limited proliferative capacity of primary cells
in culture could be the result of aging or senescence
[3]. The phenomenon was later coined the “Hayflick
limit”, to describe cells that had reached their maximum
proliferative capacity and underwent replicative
senescence. It is now known that cellular senescence is
a growth arrest program that can be triggered by many
stresses including telomere shortening (replicative
senescence), overexpression of oncogenes such as Ras
(oncogene-induced senescence), or drug-induced DNA
damage (accelerated senescence) (Figure 1). However,
the cellular program governing this growth arrest program
is considered to be similar, regardless of the senescence
trigger. This program is reported to include activation of

Senescence as a Therapy for
Cancer Treatment
“Accelerated cell senescence”, “premature
senescence”, and “senescence-like growth arrest” are
interchangeable terms that refer to the proliferative arrest
observed in tumor cells when treated with an anticancer
agent. It has long been appreciated that tumor cells have
many different responses to chemotherapy and radiation,

considered a potent tumor suppressive mechanism in vivo
and thus, is regarded as a negative regulator of oncogenic
transformation [5, 8-12]. Thus, the induction of senescence
as a treatment modality for cancer is considered a viable
approach for the clinical management of malignancy,
with the understanding that proliferative arrest may be
the predominant mechanism. Senescence-inducing drugs
may also be utilized in combination with other therapies
to potentiate either apoptosis or growth arrest in tumor
cells [13].

the best characterized of which is apoptosis that results
in the clearance of affected tumor cells. This is equated
clinically with either a partial or complete response to
therapy, mediated by regression of tumor cells. However,
many tumors are resistant to apoptosis and senescence
induction is considered a viable option since senescent
cells in vivo, are cleared by macrophages [5], thus tumor
regressions may also be achieved. The caveat to this is
the fact that in some situations, clearance of senescent
cells does not occur, for example RAF-mutant senescent
cells that comprise benign nevi. Efforts are underway
to understand the various cellular contexts under which
senescent cells persist or become cleared by the immune
system.
Furthermore, drug-induced proliferative arrest and
quiescence are clinically relevant responses that manifest
as stable disease in cancer patients. Unlike senescence,
quiescence is an easily reversible process and cancer cells
can resume proliferation when treatment ceases, upon
growth factor stimulation, or due to epigenetic mechanisms
that mediate resistance to therapy [6, 7]. Senescence is

Tubulin-Stabilizing
Drugs
Inducers of Senescence

DNA damaging agents such as doxorubicin, cisplatin,
and ionizing radiation have been well characterized as
inducers of accelerated cell senescence [14]. In addition
to these agents, we and others have demonstrated that
microtubule-stabilizing agents such as discodermolide,
and to a much lesser extent Taxol, can induce accelerated
cell senescence [15, 16] (Figure 2).
Discodermolide, which was isolated from the
Caribbean sea sponge discodermia dissoluta, is a
microtubule-stabilizing agent that was originally
characterized as an immunosuppressant [17-20].
Discodermolide is more water soluble than Taxol,
interacts synergistically with Taxol to suppress the growth
of numerous cancer cell lines [21, 22], does not exhibit
cross-resistance to Taxol-resistant cells, and importantly as
noted above, is a potent inducer of accelerated senescence
[15]. Lastly, discodermolide resistant cells do not exhibit
classical mechanisms of resistance observed in cells that
have lost sensitivity to Taxol, rendering discodermolide
and its analogs promising candidates for future clinical
development.
Ixabepilone is an analog of epothilone B, a
microtubule stabilizing agent originally isolated from
the gram-negative bacteria, Sorangium cellulosum. It
is FDA-approved for the treatment of metastatic breast
cancer in taxane-refractory patients. At present, the
senescent-inducing properties of epothilones are poorly
characterized.

Markers of senescence
Senescence

Accelerated cell senescence shares many of the wellcharacterized markers of replicative and oncogene-induced
senescence [23, 24]. These include, a large flat cellular
morphology; expression of a Senescence-Associated
β-galactosidase activity (SA-β-gal) that distinguishes them
from quiescent cells; formation of intracellular vacuoles;
resistance to mitogenic stimulation and formation of
punctuate, highly condensed facultative heterochromatin
called Senescence-Associated-Heterochromatic Foci
(SAHF) [25, 26]. Proteins that have increased expression
during senescence that have been used as markers include

as overexpression of oncogenes, telomere dysfunction or attrition,
and genotoxic stress, which includes discodermolide treatment,
promote the increased activity of p53. P53 activity and stability is
negatively regulated by MDM2 (Murine double minute 2) under
normal conditions. Under stress conditions, the DNA damage
response is activated and p53 rapidly accumulates to increase the
transcription of target genes that will promote either apoptosis or
senescence depending on the severity of the damage response.

cyclin D1, γH2AX, IL-8, IL-6 and IGFBPs, however
upregulation of these is not universally observed [25,
27]. Senescent cells are metabolically active and translate
a plethora of secretory factors that has been termed the
senescence associated secretory phenotype, or SASP.
The SASP is comprised of interleukins, inflammatory
cytokines, proteases, and extracellular matrix components
[28]. Therefore, senescent cells, unlike quiescent cells,
have comparable levels of overall protein synthesis
to cycling cells except that the repertoire of translated
mRNAs is dramatically altered.
One interesting molecular marker of senescence
is plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1), a direct
transcriptional target of p53 [29]. PAI-1 is an inhibitor of
urokinase type plasminogen activator (uPA), a secreted
protease involved in extracellular matrix remodelling.
Previously thought to be only a marker of the senescent
phenotype, PAI-1, has been reported to be required for
p53-mediated replicative senescence induction in primary
mouse diploid fibroblasts and human BJ cells [30]. While
PAI-1 is strongly induced in discodermolide-induced
accelerated cell senescence, knockdown of PAI-1 in
human tumor cells does not prevent senescence, but rather
decelerates senescence induction, suggesting that in this
context, PAI-1 acts as a modulator of senescence onset, an
observation that is consistent with the redundant nature of
senescence (Laura Klein, unpublished data).

that promotes extracellular remodeling. Therefore, the
tumor suppressive potential of senescence induction
as a therapeutic strategy is limited by the concern that
senescent cells may not be effectively cleared [27, 28,
31, 32]. Furthermore, the clinical implementation of
senescent-inducing therapies also relies somewhat on
the perception that senescence is irreversible, although
studies, including our own, indicate that accelerated cell
senescence and oncogene-induced senescence can indeed
be evaded [1, 27, 33, 34]. Importantly, senescence escape,
or reversion, is not to be confused with evasion, in which
cells that were not initially senescent outgrow and form
the majority population.
In a given population of stably senescent cells,
there is presumably, a strong selection for escape. In the
case of drug-induced accelerated senescence, it has been
our experience that escape is challenging in cell culture,
since it took several years for us to isolate a senescenceresistant line [1]. It is reasonable to assume that in vivo,
senescent cells may be in a more permissive environment
for escape, and this may contribute to tumor progression.
This logic seems particularly valid if one considers the
effects of senescence-associated SASP induction on the
surrounding extracellular matrix, which is poorly modeled
in cell culture systems.
Finally, senescent cells have areas of highly
condensed
facultative
heterochromatin
called
Senescence-Associated -Heterochromatic Foci (SAHF),
which are specialized domains of transcriptionally silent,
senescence-associated heterochromatic foci [35]. These
repress the expression of proliferation-promoting genes
and several studies have implicated epigenetic alterations
as important events in senescence reversion. One gene
that has been implicated in senescence reversion is the

Although senescence is a tumor suppressive
mechanism in normal cells, recent studies suggest that
senescence may promote transformation via creation

cells that manifests as tumor progression in vivo. This
may rationalize the observation that tumors that initially
respond to chemotherapy treatment often become resistant
to drugs. Clonal expansion of these cells is believed to
contribute to the progression of drug-resistant tumors. The
emergence of a drug-resistant population from a senescent
precursor has been termed neosis [37, 38]. Future studies
to identify factors that make this escape possible are
crucial to understanding both proliferation cues in the cell
and cancer progression.
Furthermore, it is well known that cancer cell
lines and tumors are genetically heterogeneous and this
observation also applies to the basal level of senescence
in a given cancer cell population. Specifically, in
some breast cancer cell lines, senescent cells have
been identified by SA-β-gal positivity, suggesting that
the senescence machinery is intact in some tumors.
Interestingly, high numbers of senescent cells exist in

methylation enzyme S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase,
SAHH. Inactivation of SAHH permits escape from p53
and Rb-mediated replicative senescence [36]. Therefore,
S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase downregulation
contributes to tumorigenesis, reinforcing the significance
of epigenetic processes in senescence and cellular
transformation.

Senescence, Cancer Evolution
and Differentiation
Cancer development is a multistep process and
senescent tumor cells, if not cleared by phagocytosis,
are under strong selective pressure to revert and may
gradually acquire alterations that enable them to re-enter
the cell cycle. As discussed previously, pro-inflammatory
signaling originating from senescent tumor cells, may
also promote localized transformation in neighboring

3-kinase (PI3K) signaling. Additionally, PTEN is commonly mutated in cancer, causing increased Akt activity and signaling through mTORC1.
Activation of PI3K activates Akt, which can phosphorylate TSC2 leading to the inactivation of the TSC1/2 inhibitor complex. Released
from inhibition, Rheb can then activate mTORC1. Activated mTORC1 phosphorylates its downstream substrates p70S6k and 4E-BP1.
Phosphorylation of p70S6k results in phosphorylation of rpS6. mTORC1 phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 releases 4E-BP1 from eIF4E on the 5′
cap of mRNA, and enhances cap-dependent translation. 4E-BP1 inhibits translation of Gas2, which increases the stability of p53 by binding
m-calpain and inhibiting its protease activity towards p53. Genotoxic stress activates p53, which induces the transcription and expression of
SESNs (SESN1 and SESN2). SESN phosphorylates and forms a complex with AMPK and TSC2 that results in the phosphorylation of TSC2,
eventually leading to activation of mTORC1 and its substrates 4E-BP1 and p70S6k.

estrogen receptor positive-expressing breast cancer cell
lines that are models for treatment-responsive luminal A
and B disease. Conversely, substantially fewer senescent
cells are found in breast cancer cell lines that are basallike, which represent patients with disease that although
chemo-responsive, is at high risk for relapse [39]. These
data suggest that the basal level of senescence in a tumor
reflects (a) the capacity for proliferation, and (b) the
differentiation status, which for breast cancer, guides the
choice of treatment, and also predicts outcome to therapy.

when overexpressed induces senescence independently
of other stimuli in primary cells. It is overexpressed in
various malignancies [49, 50], however, the mechanism
by which eIF4E induces oncogenic transformation is not
well understood.
In our recent paper we describe a cell line, AD32 that
is resistant to senescence [1]. This resistance is dependent
upon 4E-BP1, as re-expression of 4E-BP1 reverted
resistance to the senescence-inducer discodermolide. It
has been previously demonstrated that p53 controls the
dephosphorylation of 4E-BP1 and inhibition of translation
through mTORC1-dependent effects [44, 51, 52]. Later,
it was discovered that activation of p53 led to increased
transcription of negative regulators of mTORC1 such
as PTEN, AMPKβ, and TSC2 [53, 54]. The precise
mechanism for the p53-mediated activation of AMPK
was unknown until Budanov et al. demonstrated that
p53 initiates the transcription of sestrins in response to
genotoxic stress [55]. The sestrin family of cytoplasmic
proteins consists of SESN1, SESN2, and SESN3, all of
which function in antioxidant defense by regenerating
peroxiredoxins. In particular, SESN1 and SESN2 are able
to negatively regulate mTOR, a redox sensitive kinase.
However this was independent of their redox activity. Since
redox-impaired mutants were able to suppress mTORC1
as efficiently as wild type [55]. Importantly, sestrins
mediate mTORC1 suppression via AMPK activation,
which in turn phosphorylates TSC2, a negative regulator
of mTORC1. Furthermore, AMPK can phosphorylate p53
at Ser15, a site that enhances p53 stability and activation
[56, 57]. This AMPK-mediated p53 stabilization may
result in a positive feedback loop, further indicating the
importance of p53 and mTORC1 signaling in response to
genotoxic stress [58]. In addition, 4E-BP1 has been shown
to control the translation of Gas2, a protein that regulates
p53 stability and senescence [59].
AD32 cells, which have escaped senescence,
express high levels of stable p53 protein relative to the
senescence-sensitive precursor cell line, A549. In addition,
we demonstrated that with increasing discodermolide
resistance, p53 protein expression increased, while 4EBP1 expression decreased [1]. While our findings support
previous studies that had established a relationship
between 4E-BP1 and p53 [51, 52, 59-61], the finding
that increased levels of stabilized p53 was not associated
with senescence, but rather, escape from senescence, was
paradoxical.
This finding led us to ponder the current paradigm
that places p53 as an essential component in accelerated
cell senescence. Increased p53 activity is a hallmark of
cell senescence, but does p53 drive senescence induction?
Can senescence happen in the absence of p53? Or, is it
possible that p53 suppresses senescence? Links between
p53, p21 and cellular senescence have been well
established. It is certainly true in some primary mouse
embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), that replicative senescence

The key players: mTOR, 4E-BP1, and
p53
The PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway is important
in cancer progression and regulates metabolism, cell
survival and cell growth [40] (Figure 3). The mammalian
target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway exists as two protein
complexes in the cell, mTOR complex 1 and 2 (mTORC1
and mTORC2, respectively), reviewed in [41]. Although
the function of these complexes is still an area of active
research, mTORC1, which contains mTOR, Raptor,
mLST8 and PRAS40, regulates protein synthesis and cell
proliferation. Conversely, mTORC2, contains mTOR,
Sin1, Rictor, mLIST8 and PROTOR, and primarily
regulates movement of the actin cytoskeleton and cell
spreading. Rapamycin is an immunosuppressant that
inhibits mTORC1 via binding to FKBP12 and together
this complex binds and inhibits mTORC1 Ser/Thr kinase
activity. Previously, it was thought that mTORC2 was
rapamycin insensitive; however, prolonged treatment with
rapamycin decreases mTORC2 complex formation [42].
Studies investigating the role of mTOR in senescence
have been limited, and focused on its known regulation
of proliferation. Rapamycin has been reported to suppress
senescence in a variety of cell lines [43, 44] and also has
anti-aging effects that can increase life span in mice [45].
Additionally, fasting or caloric restriction is known to
decrease mTORC1 activity and contribute to longevity.
A recent study by Sengupta et al. demonstrates that
mTORC1 activity decreases the production of ketones by
the liver, which is associated with aging, and suggests that
the effects of mTORC1 activity on aging can be attributed
to mTORC1’s role as a nutrient sensor [46].
4E-BP1 (eIF4E binding protein 1) is a
downstream substrate of mTORC1 that regulates capdependent translation. 4E-BP1 undergoes hierarchical
phosphorylation by mTORC1 leading to its activation,
reviewed in [47]. Inhibition of mTORC1 by drugs such as
rapamycin dephosphorylates 4E-BP1, thereby enhancing
its association with the mRNA 5′ cap-binding protein,
eIF4E, and suppressing cap-dependent translation (Figure
3). Conversely, 4E-BP1 may be hyperphosphorylated by
activated mTOR, leading to its dissociation from eIF4E
and enhanced translation of a specific subset of growth
promoting mRNAs [48]. eIF4E acts oncogenically, and

Many of the mRNAs identified play crucial roles in
cell growth, metastasis, angiogenesis, and cell survival.
Undoubtedly, there are vastly more that remain to be
identified. The mRNAs regulated by eIF4E are considered
“weak” mRNAs since they are generally poorly translated
and associate with the monosome fraction in polysome
gradients, likely due to their highly structured 5′ UTRs.
“Weak” mRNAs include proto-oncogenes and growth
factors, whereas “strong” mRNAs, include housekeeping
genes, reviewed in [50]. Thus far, the precise mechanism
that eIF4E utilizes to target particular mRNAs is unknown.
It would be of value to characterize the repertoire of
transcripts bound to eIF4E under different conditions and
in different tissues. It has been demonstrated that eIF4E
is phosphorylated by MNK1 and MNK2 kinases and may
be regulated by other kinases, depending on nutrient, or
growth signals [72, 73]. As the main inhibitor of eIF4E,
and a direct substrate of mTORC1, future studies should
focus on transcripts inhibited by 4E-BP1.
To this end, we performed transcriptome analysis
on 4E-BP1 overexpressing cell lines and identified
several changes in p53 response genes and those involved
in the DNA damage response, supporting a role for
discodermolide as a senescence-inducer that elicits a DNA
damage response. Since p53 is a pleiotropic signaling
molecule that participates in a multitude of cellular
processes, it is plausible that the elevated expression
observed in AD32 cells simply reflects a high basal level
of DNA damage that the cells acquired while senescent,
which can be tolerated by the revertant AD32 population.
In this model, AD32 cells may have adjusted the internal
p53 ‘rheostat’ to proliferate in the presence of high p53
expression.
Others have used polysomal fractionation combined
with microarray analysis to identify those transcripts
that are more efficiently translated [68, 74]. While these
approaches enrich for mRNAs that are associated with
ribosomes, they do not directly identify transcripts bound
to eIF4E and 4E-BP1, or associated proteins that may
contribute to eIF4E’s specificity for particular mRNAs.
For instance, CPEB is a RNA-binding protein that
recognizes and binds a specific sequence in the 3′ UTR of
mRNA in Xenopus laevis. The Xenopus 4E-BP, maskin,
interacts with CPEB and together with other proteins
regulates the translation of mRNA [75, 76]. A study in
Saccharomyces cerevisiae has identified PUF proteins,
mRNA binding proteins that interact with the yeast
4E-BPs, eap1 and caf20. PUF proteins in combination
with 4E-BPs mediate translation of a specific subset of
mRNAs [74]. Recent studies employing RNA-Binding
Protein Immunoprecipitation-Microarray Profiling (RIpChip or ribonomic profiling) were able to identify RNP
complexes that specifically associated with mRNAs that
shared biological function or activity [77-80]. Future
studies will be able to identify which mRNAs are inhibited
by 4E-BP1 and possible cognate factors that facilitate this

requires p53 and cells can be immortalized by loss of
p53, p19ARF, or Rb proteins [11]. However, differences
in basal senescence between cell lines do exist, just as
differences in the propensity for senescent cells to exhibit
a SASP phenotype exist. For example, human cells seem
to be more dependent upon p21 for growth arrest, whereas
p21 is not essential for senescence in mouse fibroblasts
[62]. Additionally, there are two known tumor suppressor
pathways that regulate the senescence response, the p53
pathway and the p53-independent or p16INK4a/RB
pathway. Each of these pathways integrates a variety of
stress signals that determine whether a cell undergoes
senescence or apoptosis. In many cancer cell lines, p53
is mutated or mislocalized and p16 is epigenetically
silenced; yet these cells are still able to execute the
senescence program [16].
Recent studies, including our own, demonstrate that
senescence can occur in cells that have compromised
p53 [15, 43, 63-65]. A recent study by Demidenko et al.
indicates that p53 may act as a suppressor of senescence
in certain contexts [44]. This model provides a possible
explanation for the reversion of accelerated cell senescence
that leads to the generation of AD32 cells, despite high
expression of p53 and p21. In this study [44], cells were
engineered to conditionally overexpress p21 and it was
found that overexpression of p53 drove quiescence, while
p21 drove senescence. Cells induced to overexpress
ectopic p21 became senescent, but this could be converted
to quiescence by p53 overexpression, indicating that
p53-driven suppression of the senescent phenotype
may override senescence driven by p21. Furthermore,
rapamycin was able to suppress the senescent phenotype,
and also nutlin3a, an MDM2 antagonist that stabilizes p53.
Interestingly, AD32 cells are cross resistant to rapamycin
but have wild-type 4E-BP1 function, capable of binding
eIF4E [1]. We have discovered that 4E-BP1 expression
modulates senescence, as restoration of expression
made these cells susceptible to discodermolide-induced
accelerated cell senescence. Partial knockdown of p53 in
AD32 cells had essentially no effect on discodermolideinduced senescence or cytotoxicity, thereby indicating
that 4E-BP1, in this system, may play a more significant
role in the accelerated cell senescence response than p53.

Future directions
It is known that eIF4E acts oncogenically
if overexpressed, resulting in tumor growth [49].
Presumably, its oncogenic activity lies in its ability to
direct the translation of specific mRNAs that participate
in advancing the malignant phenotype [66]. Identification
of transcripts that are bound by eIF4E has been elusive,
with most studies utilizing eIF4E overexpression screens
[67, 68]. The putative mRNA targets that have been
discovered include cMYC, cdk2, cyclinD1, MMP9,
Mcl-1, Bcl-2, survivin, VEGF, and FGF2 [66, 69-71].

specificity, and changes in the population of transcripts
bound during senescence.
We cannot rule out the possibility that 4E-BP1 is
a multifunctional protein, that regulates senescence in
an mTORC1-independent manner. Overexpression of
a 4E-BP1 Thr37/46Ala nonphosphorylatable mutant
in AD32 cells was able to partially revert resistance
to discodermolide, indicating that the function of 4EBP1 in senescence may be independent from mTORC1
phosphorylation. Although rapamycin universally
dephosphorylates the mTORC1 substrate S6K, it does
not cause 4E-BP1 dephosphorylation in every cell type
[81], nor does it result in dissociation of the mTORC2
complex in every case. These observations have led to
the hypothesis that clinical response to rapalogs occurs
in tumors that have dephosphorylation of 4E-BP1 and
S6K, and mTORC2 dissociation, although this has yet
to be substantiated. Several groups, including ours have
suggested regulation of 4E-BP1 by additional kinases,
reviewed in [82]. In fact, we have clearly demonstrated
that dual suppression of the RAS-PI3K by combined
MEK and rapalog treatment is highly synergistic and that
mechanistically this is mediated via potent suppression of
cap-dependent translation and dephosphorylation of S6
and 4E-BP1 [83].
A less well-characterized role of 4E-BP1 is its ability
to regulate the subcellular localization of eIF4E, as ~30%
of 4E-BP1 is localized to the nucleus [84]. Importantly,
nuclear localization is prevented in the presence of
oncogenic RAS, although this mechanism is not well
understood. 4E-BPs do not have nuclear localization or
export motifs, so it appears that the nucleocytoplasmic
trafficking of the protein may be regulated by RAS. These
studies provide further evidence of mTORC-independent
functions of 4E-BP1.
Phosphorylation of Ser15 of p53 abrogates the
p53-MDM2 interaction, and AD32 cells have increased
phosphorylation of Ser15. However, both MDM2 and p53
are regulated by various kinases. For example, MDM2
undergoes phosphorylation by AKT, a cell survival factor,
at Ser166. Phosphoryation of MDM2 results in increased
E3 ligase activity, targeting p53 for degradation. It is
unclear how during DNA damage, p53 is able to elude
ubiquitination by MDM2 so rapidly. Our cells contain
increased levels of both MDM2 and p53. It has recently
been discovered that microRNA 605 (mir605) regulates
the p53-MDM2 interaction. Mir605 is a transcriptional
target of p53 and participates in a positive feedback loop
by degrading MDM2 [85]. This mechanism provides
another example of the complexity of the senescence
response. Adding to the complexity, mir605 when
overexpressed preferentially induces apoptosis rather than
senescence [85]. It is plausible that there may be other
miRNAs capable of regulating senescence. With each
new discovery about p53 regulation, new possibilities
arise, suggesting that there is a delicate balance between

tumor suppression and oncogenesis with multiple levels
of regulation.
