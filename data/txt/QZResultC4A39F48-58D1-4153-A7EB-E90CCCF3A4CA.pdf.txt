Abstract
Multiple pathways have been proposed to explain how proteasome inhibition induces cell death, but mechanisms remain unclear. To approach this issue, we performed a genome-wide siRNA screen to evaluate the
genetic determinants that confer sensitivity to bortezomib (Velcade (R); PS-341). This screen identified 100
genes whose knockdown affected lethality to bortezomib and to a structurally diverse set of other proteasome
inhibitors. A comparison of three cell lines revealed that 39 of 100 genes were commonly linked to cell death.
We causally linked bortezomib-induced cell death to the accumulation of ASF1B, Myc, ODC1, Noxa, BNIP3,
Gadd45α, p-SMC1A, SREBF1, and p53. Our results suggest that proteasome inhibition promotes cell death
primarily by dysregulating Myc and polyamines, interfering with protein translation, and disrupting essential
DNA damage repair pathways, leading to programmed cell death. Cancer Res; 70(11); 4318–26. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
The primary targets of most cancer chemotherapies are
known. However, the downstream effect on the cell is generally poorly understood, particularly the sequence of events
directly involved in the commitment of the tumor cell to
die. This lack of knowledge is particularly profound for
proteasome inhibition because the majority of intracellular
proteins can be degraded by the proteasome. As such, simply
showing that proteasome inhibition can result in the stabilization of a protein does not necessarily imply that it is mechanistically relevant and important for cell death. Prior studies
have suggested that bortezomib has an antitumor effect by
inhibition of antiapoptotic proteins (e.g., NFκB and Bcl2),
stabilization of tumor suppressors (e.g., p53), disruption
of cell cycle, dysregulation of Fas or tumor necrosis factor–
related apoptosis-inducing ligand pathways, increases in
reactive oxygen species (ROS), stabilization of Myc and Noxa,

and induction of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, any of
which may trigger cell death (1–4). Despite the pleiotropic
effects of proteasome inhibition, bortezomib is an effective
cancer chemotherapy which exploits key weaknesses that
differentiate tumor cells from normal cells. Determining
the primary mechanisms by which bortezomib induces
tumor cell death would increase our understanding of these
key weaknesses and allow for better utilization of bortezomib
in the clinic.
RNA interference (RNAi) has been widely adopted for functional genomic studies, including defining drug mechanism
(5). Genome-wide RNAi allows for different mechanisms to
be ranked against each other, providing an evaluation of
their relative phenotypic dominance. Some limitations
of RNAi are that protein knockdown is transient, never
results in complete elimination of the protein, and has various degrees of off-target effects. Genetic redundancy may
also mask the phenotype of targeted genes. Nevertheless,
RNAi studies have provided powerful insights into drug
mechanism (6–8).
Bortezomib induces death of most cell lines in culture
within 72 hours, with an LC50 of ∼10 nmol/L. We performed
the genome-wide siRNA screen to identify genes whose
knockdown affected the cytotoxicity of bortezomib using
the colon cancer cell line HCT-116 because of its highly
reproducible sensitivity to bortezomib and high transfectability when compared with other cell lines. The effect of
the top hits from the screen were also compared in A375
and HeLa cells, highly transfectable lines derived from melanoma and cervical cancer, respectively.
Herein, we show that bortezomib leads to cell death by
interfering with ribosome function, essential DNA damage
pathways, and dysregulation of Myc. In particular, we examine
the effect of bortezomib on protein translation initiation,

especially eIF2α and mammalian target of rapamycin
(mTOR), the effect of upregulation of Myc and ODC1 on polyamine homeostasis, and DNA damage signaling. In addition,
we show that a common set of 39 genes is responsible for conferring sensitivity to proteasome inhibition in multiple cell
lines. Although these results do not account for differences
in bortezomib efficacy across tumor types seen in the clinic
and cannot account for the effect of the tumor microenvironment on bortezomib sensitivity, they provide a foundation for
future studies exploring these issues.

Materials and Methods
Genome-wide screen and hit deconvolution
HCT-116 cells were transfected with 15 nmol/L siRNA
oligos (siGENOME SMARTpool, Dharmacon) using DharmaFECT 2 (DH2) reagent (Dharmacon) in Opti-MEM
(Invitrogen) in a BioCoat poly-D-lysine (PDL)–coated 384well daughter plates (BD Biosciences). Forty-eight hours
after transfection, cells were treated with 0, 4, or 7
nmol/L bortezomib and incubated for a further 48 hours,
after which viability was assessed using ATPlite reagent
(Perkin-Elmer) and luminescence was measured using a
LEADseeker imaging system (GE Healthcare).
SMARTpool hits were deconvoluted in HCT-116, A375, and
HeLa cells again in sextuplicate, except that CELLCOAT
384-well PDL-coated black, clear-bottom plates (Greiner)
were used. For HCT-116 on the Greiner plates, DH2 lipid
was reduced from 0.075 to 0.057 μL/well. Bortezomib was
modestly more potent under these conditions, so concentrations of 2 nmol/L (LC15) and 5 nmol/L (LC60) were used. For
A375, changes included the use of DharmaFECT 4 (DH4)
transfection reagent at 0.07 μL/well, 300 cells per well, and
bortezomib treatments at 4 nmol/L (LC5) and 7 nmol/L
(LC55). For HeLa, changes included the use of DharmaFECT
1 (DH1) transfection reagent at 0.2 μL/well, 900 cells per
well, and bortezomib treatments at 12 nmol/L (LC25) and
25 nmol/L (LC50). Bortezomib will be provided to qualified
researchers once a standard Materials Transfer Agreement
has been executed.
Western blot and immunoprecipitation
HCT-116 cells were treated with 30 nmol/L bortezomib
(LC90) or vehicle (0.1% DMSO) for the times indicated. Samples were prepared for SDS-PAGE and quantitative immunoblot analysis with antisera as specified in the Supplementary
Data using tubulin as a normalization control (Supplementary Fig. S2B). Myc was immunoprecipitated using anti-Myc
agarose beads (Novus Biologics) from HCT-116 cells that
had been treated for 8 hours with either 0.1% DMSO or
30 nmol/L bortezomib. Associated Myc (Epitomics) and
Max (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were quantified using an
Odyssey Infrared Imager (LI-COR Biosciences).
Myc reporter assay
Myc activation was measured by transfection of HCT-116
cells with the Cignal Myc-responsive luciferase reporter
(SABiosciences) that is under the control of a minimal cyto-

megalovirus (CMV) promoter and tandem repeats of the
E-box sequence using pCMV firefly luciferase for normalization. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were treated
with 30 nmol/L bortezomib or vehicle for the indicated times
under normal or serum-starved conditions, after which luciferase activities were determined using Dual-Glo reagents
(Promega) as described in the Supplementary Data.
Polyamine high-performance liquid chromatography
assay
Polyamines were quantified by high-performance liquid
chromatography on an AccQTag column using the AccQTag
method (Waters) with a modified acetonitrile gradient as
specified in the Supplementary Data.
Data treatment and statistics
All ATPlite fluorescence intensity values were log2 transformed (V). The Bliss Independence (BI) scores were calculated from the log2-transformed data as
Vxn þ Vg0 − Vgn − Vx0 ;
where Vxn is the mean of RNAi oligos treated with 4 nmol/L
(or 7 nmol/L) bortezomib, Vg0 is the mean of GL2 control
cells, Vgn is the mean of GL2 cells treated with 4 nmol/L
(or 7 nmol/L) bortezomib, and Vx0 is the mean of RNAi oligos
treated with 0 nmol/L bortezomib.
The Rescue scores were calculated using log2-transformed
data as min(Vgn, Vx0) − Vxn.
The SE was calculated for each of the equation variables.
These estimates were then squared, and the square root of
their sum was taken to give the SE of the score. Probabilities
that gene knockdown was on target were calculated by using
hypergeometric distribution function based on deconvoluted
oligo data as specified in the Supplementary Data.

Results
Design of screen
Gene knockdown in HCT-116 by 15 nmol/L Dharmacon
SMARTpool siRNA was allowed to progress for 48 hours to
provide for adequate depletion of protein, followed by
48 hours with two concentrations of bortezomib (LC15 and
LC60 at 48 h) or a vehicle control. These concentrations allow
for the evaluation of either enhancement or suppression of
bortezomib-induced cell death by the SMARTpools, by which
both activators and inhibitors of key pathways can be
detected. The genome-wide screen was performed with
21,062 SMARTpools in duplicate. Three thousand eight
hundred and seventy-seven SMARTpool hits were selected
from the primary screen and rescreened in sextuplicate
(Supplementary Fig. S1A).
The scoring of the screen using BI assumptions (see Supplementary Results) enabled assignment of phenotypes to
the siRNAs, namely, synthetic lethality, suppressor, or epistasis (Supplementary Fig. S1B and C). The magnitude of the BI
score indicates the relative importance of the effect for the
induction and execution of cell death, although this ranking

is confounded by the efficiency with which the oligos are able
to knock down their respective mRNAs and ultimately
reduce protein levels. It remains a formal possibility that differences in knockdown efficiency rather than target biology
will be a primary determinant of interaction strength. Nevertheless, because knockdown efficiency is likely to be random
across pathways, it is anticipated that pathways can be
ranked by this approach provided that at least some proteins
within each pathway are efficiently knocked down.
Behavior of SMARTpools
At clinically relevant concentrations (i.e., low nanomolar;
ref. 9), bortezomib selectively inhibits the proteasome, primarily through the β5 subunit (PSMB5, chymotrypsin-like
protease) but also the β1 subunit (PSMB6, caspase-like
protease or PGPH; ref. 10). Therefore, the behavior of
SMARTpools targeting proteasome subunits is of particular
interest. From the genome-wide screen, 7% of all SMARTpools had viabilities of <15% relative to the GL2 negative
control. In contrast, 14 of 14 SMARTpools targeting 20S
core subunits had viabilities of <15% (Fig. 1A; Supplementary Table S3A). Thus, the proteasome is critically required
for viability. Because all SMARTpools targeting constitutive
proteasome subunits had similar effects on viability, the
concentration of 15 nmol/L SMARTpool seems adequate
for genome-wide screening in HCT-116.
Because proteasome subunit knockdown leaves few viable
cells, evaluation of the interaction of proteasome RNAi with
bortezomib may be compromised. Contrary to this expectation, 14 of 14 SMARTpools targeting 20S core subunits were

synthetic lethal (BI = −0.46 to −1.99 at 4 nmol/L bortezomib),
indicating that knockdown of 20S core subunits sensitized
the cell to bortezomib (Fig. 1A). Strong scores were obtained
even when the SMARTpool alone reduced viabilities to <5%
(e.g., PSMA1, BI = −1.17 ± 0.08 with 3% viability). Because the
data for the 20S core subunits are highly consistent, this
indicates that useful drug interaction data can be obtained
even at viabilities <5%. Because <1% of the SMARTpools in
the primary screen gave viabilities <5%, SMARTpools with
low viabilities were not excluded from further analysis.
Stabilization of proteins by inhibition of the proteasome is
expected to be the proximal determinant of bortezomibinduced cell death, both by inducing unfolded protein
stress and by stabilizing proapoptotic proteins. Indeed,
cycloheximide abrogates bortezomib-induced apoptosis
(11, 12). Based on this result, knockdown of ribosome subunits should result in resistance to proteasome inhibition by
reducing the rate of protein synthesis and the accumulation
of proteins.
Of the SMARTpools targeting the 34 small ribosome subunits (40S; ref. 13), 21 resulted in viabilities of <15%
(Fig. 1B; Supplementary Table S3A). Of the SMARTpools targeting the 47 large ribosome subunits (60S; ref. 13), 44
resulted in viabilities of <15% (Fig. 1C; Supplementary
Table S3A). SMARTpools targeting 29 of the 40S ribosome
subunits and 44 of the 60S ribosome subunits gave positive
BI scores (BI = 0.29–2.83 at 7 nmol/L bortezomib).
In contrast to the expectation that ribosome activity
would be required for cell death induced by bortezomib, of
76 significant SMARTpools targeting ribosome subunits, only

RPS8 and RPL5 knockdown gave significant rescue, suggesting an off-target effect with these two pools. The very
consistent lack of significant rescue indicating epistasis
suggests that inhibition of protein translation and proteasome inhibition by bortezomib result in related stresses to
the cell (see Discussion).
Deconvolution of genome-wide hits
Because of the pleiotropic effect of proteasome inhibition
by bortezomib, the frequency of interactions due to off-target
effects of the SMARTpools was anticipated to be substantial.
To determine the likelihood that the phenotype was due to
knockdown of the target, the individual oligos making up
each SMARTpool were further evaluated (four oligos per
gene at 4 nmol/L individual oligo). Eight hundred and sixtyeight genes were selected based on the screen results or prior
literature. Because of the coherence of their data, proteasome and ribosome subunits were underrepresented in this
deconvolution set. The oligos making up the selected
SMARTpools were individually evaluated for interaction with
bortezomib in sextuplicate (Supplementary Table S3B). The
top 160 hits were rearrayed and evaluated again in sextuplicate. Finally, these top 160 hits were reassayed twice using an
updated set of individual oligos (Supplementary Table S3C).
One hundred genes gave significant results in HCT-116
based on a hypergeometric evaluation of the deconvoluted
oligo data (Table 1). The 100 genes were classified into pathway modules using their gene annotation (Supplementary
Table S3D). Based on the statistical approach used to validate hits, it is anticipated that 5 to 10 hits within Table 1
are false positives.
Genes whose siRNAs score as suppressor (Table 1) represent those whose presence is important for inducing cell death
in response to proteasome inhibition; removal of these
proteins protects against bortezomib-induced cell death. It
is possible that these proteins are proteasome substrates that
when stabilized contribute to cell death. Therefore, we investigated whether these proteins were stabilized by proteasome
inhibition. ASF1B, BNIP3, Gadd45α, Myc, ODC1, PMAIP1
(Noxa), p-SMC1A, SREBF1, and p53 showed increases in
protein levels following bortezomib treatment (Fig. 2).
ATG4A, BAX, BXDC2, DDX27, EIF4E, EIF4G1, SETX, SNIP1,
and SORBS1 did not show clear increases (Supplementary
Fig. S2A).
Genes associated with pathway modules were explored in
more detail, focusing on ribosome biogenesis and translation, Myc/polyamine, and homologous recombination (HR).
Among the translation pathway genes, phosphorylation of
targets of mTORC1, namely 4EBP1 (pS65) and S6K (pT389),
both decreased following bortezomib treatment (Fig. 3A).
Both the pT37/pT46 and total 4EBP1 antibodies indicate that
4EBP1 shifts toward the hypophosphorylated form. In agreement with ribosome knockdown being epistatic with bortezomib, we have found that cycloheximide is epistatic with
bortezomib in HCT-116 viability and does not rescue cells
(Fig. 3B). The phosphorylation of Ser51 on EIF2S1 (eIF2α)
decreased probably due to increases in PPP1R15A (Gadd34)
levels (Fig. 3C).

Cancer Res; 70(11) June 1, 2010

Myc pathway gene Max was modestly affected by bortezomib treatment (Fig. 4A). Immunoprecipitation of Myc
coprecipitates Max but bortezomib treatment does not result
in a commensurate increase in associated Max (Fig. 4B). A
Myc reporter assay showed that the stabilization of Myc
results in increased transcriptional activity both in the
presence and in the absence of serum (Fig. 4C). ODC1, a target of Myc, is increased (Fig. 2) and the product of ODC1,
putrescine, showed a marked increase following bortezomib
treatment (Fig. 4D).
Evidence was collected suggesting that bortezomib as a
single agent potentiates DNA damage signaling. HR pathway
gene RAD51 showed increases following bortezomib treatment. The phosphorylation of SMC1A (pS957), TP53 (pS15),
H2AFX (pS139), and CHEK2 (pT68) on their ATM sites
and the ubiquitination of FANCD2 were also increased by
bortezomib, particularly at 18 and 24 hours, whereas MDC1
and RAD21 levels were unaffected (Figs. 2 and 5). The phosphorylation of CHEK1 (pT317) on its ATR site was modestly
increased.

stabilization induces cell death across a time course of bortezomib

oligos in Table 1 was determined by Western blot on HCT-116 treated
with vehicle (0.1% DMSO, top blot) or 30 nmol/L bortezomib (LC90
concentration, bottom blot). The control lanes 8 and 9 (24-h treatment)
show that exposure of the film for the top and bottom blots was
equivalent. Phosphorylation of SMC1A and TP53 on their ATM sites was
also evaluated. Full-length SREBF1 is indicated by the arrowhead. Two
bands that are consistent with activation of the two spliceforms of SREBF1
by MBTPS1 (S1P) and MBTPS2 (S2P) are indicated by the two bars.

Discussion
The 100 genes within Table 1 highlight the critical biology
involved in the response of HCT-116 cells to bortezomib. We
have chosen to focus on candidate proteasome substrates
and pathway modules where new biology has been identified
that had not previously been characterized as being critical
for proteasome inhibition–induced cell death, specifically
mTOR inhibition, polyamine dysregulation, and potentiation
of DNA damage signaling. A comprehensive analysis of
the role of all of the genes within Table 1 will await further

Figure 3. Bortezomib inhibits translation initiation signaling. Regulation
of proteins was determined in the same manner as Fig. 2. A, mTOR
substrates. Evaluation of the phosphorylation state of 4EBP1 is
consistent with substantial mTOR inhibition induced by proteasome
inhibition. Phosphorylation of S6K is also reduced after 4 h, although total
protein levels are unaffected. B, the dose-response curve for the effect
of cycloheximide (CHx) on viability (ATPlite) in HCT-116 at 48 h was
determined in the presence of vehicle (0.1% DMSO; ) or 7 nmol/L
bortezomib (LC74; ). Cycloheximide was epistatic with bortezomib and
did not rescue cells from bortezomib-induced cell death. C, eIF2α status.
Phosphorylation of eIF2α is reduced following 6 h with no changes in
total protein. PPP1R15A (Gadd34) levels increased with decreasing eIF2α
phosphorylation. Full-length blots are presented in Supplementary
Fig. S8, along with theoretical molecular weights of the proteins.

Evaluation of hits in other cell lines and with other
proteasome inhibitors
More than half of the 100 genes interacting with bortezomib in HCT-116 gave similar phenotypes in the melanoma
cell line A375 (Supplementary Table S1) or in the cervical
cancer cell line HeLa (Supplementary Table S2). Notably,
the knockdown of 39 genes gave similar phenotypes in all
three cell lines (underlined genes in Table 1). Therefore,
although details of the induction of cell death probably vary
between cell lines, these results indicate the existence of
common themes. These common themes include translation
initiation, Myc/polyamines, and key ubiquitin pathway genes.
The individual oligos for each of the 100 genes interacting
with bortezomib behaved consistently with multiple classes
of proteasome inhibitors in HCT-116 cells. RNAi interactions
with the peptidyl boronate MLN2238, the peptide ML912,
and the epoxide epoxomicin were highly correlated (r2 =
0.86–0.91) with interactions with bortezomib (Supplementary
Fig. S3). The interactions with the β-lactone salinosporamide
A were less correlated (r2 = 0.69–0.70), although still much

Cotransfection of Renilla luciferase showed that viability was unaffected

absence of serum, showed a significant increase in Myc transcription
activity. Fold induction is relative to the vehicle control. D, HCT-116 cells
were treated with vehicle (0.1% DMSO, dashed line) or 30 nmol/L

active sites, and less bortezomib is needed to reduce proteasome function below a critical limit. Therefore, these data are
consistent with bortezomib inducing cell death by binding to
the 20S core directly.

Figure 5. Bortezomib potentiates DNA damage signaling. Regulation
of proteins was determined in the same manner as Fig. 2. Markers of DNA
damage response, including RAD51 stabilization and phosphorylation
of H2AFX and CHEK2 at their ATM sites, are increased following
bortezomib, whereas CHEK1 phosphorylation at its ATR site is
upregulated more modestly. Monoubiquitination of FANCD2 (top band)
is increased relative to the unmodified FANCD2 (bottom band) beginning
at 12 h. MDC1, the three closely spaced bands above 247 kDa, is not
clearly differentially regulated between vehicle and bortezomib treatment,
contrary to prior reports (31). Neither full-length nor separase-cleaved
fragments of RAD21 increase following bortezomib treatment. Full-length
blots are presented in Supplementary Fig. S8, along with theoretical
molecular weights of the proteins.

studies. Our results do support some previously suggested
mechanisms, including key roles for ER stress, p53, and
Myc. Surprisingly, we do not see evidence for the critical
involvement of ROS, NFκB, activator protein-1, or cell cycle
proteins in HCT-116. We have provided some initial RNAiindependent data to substantiate suggested pathway involvement. Below, we suggest the context within which these
interactions are occurring. Additional modules are explored
in Supplementary Results. Specifically, regulation of apoptotic proteins by bortezomib is presented in Supplementary
Fig. S4. In addition, we show that BNIP3 stabilization does
not seem to result in ROS or mitophagy as shown in Supplementary Figs. S4 to S7. Although not all phenotypes that bortezomib might affect (growth arrest, apoptosis, necrosis,
autophagy, and senescence) will be equally captured by the
ATPlite viability assay used in this screen, these results represent a genome-wide evaluation of genetic sensitivity within
the inherent biases of that assay.
Proteasome subunits
Knocking down the 20S core subunits of the proteasome
gave a synthetic lethal phenotype (Table 1; Fig. 1). These data
indicate that the function of the 20S core subunits compensates for bortezomib-induced cell death. RNAi against 20S
proteasome subunits reduces the number of proteasome

Ribosome subunits and translation
Broadly speaking, oligos affecting ribosome function
scored as epistatic in the screen (Table 1; Fig. 1), contrary
to the expectation that inhibition of the ribosome should
prevent the buildup of cytotoxic proteins caused by proteasome inhibition. This result suggests that inhibition of ribosome function induces a stress similar to inhibition of
proteasome function. Indeed, an epistatic interaction between protein translation and the ubiquitin-proteasome system has been shown previously in yeast; inhibition of either
results in the toxic depletion of free ubiquitin pools (14).
Three of the genes with suppressor oligos are involved in
translation initiation, EIF4E, EIF4G1, and PPP1R15B (CReP,
constitutive repressor of eIF2α phosphorylation), suggesting
that the activity of these genes is important for induction of
cell death by bortezomib. eIF4E binds the cap structure of
mRNA and, in a complex with eIF4A and eIF4G, recruits
the mRNA to the ribosome. mTOR promotes protein synthesis in part by phosphorylating 4EBP1, reducing its ability to
compete with eIF4G binding to eIF4E. HCT-116 cells are
resistant to mTOR inhibition due to downregulation of
4EBP1 protein levels, reducing its ability to inhibit eIF4E
(15). Our data suggest that siRNA against eIF4E could reduce
eIF4E levels sufficiently that 4EBP1 would be capable of
inhibiting protein translation. This inhibition would prevent
protein accumulation following proteasome inhibition, rescuing the cells from bortezomib-induced apoptosis. Therefore, the EIF4E and EIF4G1 hits suggest that bortezomib
induces mTOR inhibition but that, in HCT-116 cells, this
inhibition is unable to inhibit protein synthesis. In fact, bortezomib treatment does shift 4EBP1 to the inhibitory hypophosphorylated form (Fig. 3A). Phosphorylation of S6K is also
inhibited, consistent with mTOR inhibition. These data agree
with a recent publication (16). Many tumor cells have dysregulated protein translation inhibition (17). In contrast, normal cells should respond to this bortezomib-induced
mTOR inhibition with a reduction in protein translation, suggesting a rationale for the therapeutic window of bortezomib.
The other suppressor hit, PPP1R15B, is the constitutive
form of the inducible PPP1R15A (Gadd34). Although we were
not able to evaluate PPP1R15B levels, PPP1R15A was
increased quite dramatically (Fig. 3C). Both are regulatory
subunits for protein phosphatase 1, targeting EIF2S1 (epistatic gene, also known as eIF2α) for dephosphorylation. Phosphorylation of EIF2S1 results in general translation
inhibition, although some stress response mRNAs are still
translated (17). It is possible that the translation of these
stress mRNAs is involved in the induction of apoptosis. Salubrinal, an inhibitor of EIF2S1 dephosphorylation, promoted
cell death following bortezomib treatment (18). Thus, phosphorylated EIF2S1 is important for induction of cell death by
bortezomib. In many multiple myeloma cell lines, bortezomib induces a robust and long-lived phosphorylation of

EIF2S1 (19), consistent with this tumor type being particularly sensitive to bortezomib.
Under hypoxic conditions, phosphorylation of EIF2S1 provides acute and general translation inhibition, but this is lost
following the induction of PPP1R15A. More chronic translation inhibition is provided by inhibition of the mTOR
pathway, possibly via upregulation of BNIP3 or DDIT4
(Redd1; ref. 17). Recent work suggests that induction of
DDIT4 is important for bortezomib resistance in multiple
myeloma (20). In this way, bortezomib mimics hypoxia and
hypoxia resistance may predict sensitivity to bortezomib.
Myc
Myc stabilization and its induction of PMAIP1 (Noxa) have
previously been proposed to be critical for cell death following proteasome inhibition (21). Myc, ODC1, and PMAIP1 are
substantially increased by proteasome inhibition (Fig. 2).
ODC1 (ornithine decarboxylase) is both a known substrate
of the proteasome and relatively strongly induced target of
Myc (22, 23). Surprisingly, the oligo targeting SRM (spermidine synthase) is synthetically lethal with bortezomib,
suggesting that the intermediate between ODC1 and SRM
(i.e., putrescine) is increased by bortezomib and, at least in
this setting, toxic. The oligo targeting EIF5A, which is modified by spermidine (24), is also synthetically lethal with bortezomib, suggesting that putrescine affects the modification
of elF5A as well. We have observed a significant increase in
putrescine levels in bortezomib-treated cells (Fig. 4D),
followed by a significant drop in spermidine levels at 24
hours. Proteasome inhibition by MG-132 or lactacystin has
previously been shown to prevent modification of eIF5A by
spermidine (25). Excess putrescine accumulation has been
shown to inhibit the modification of eIF5A (26), suggesting
that bortezomib blocks eIF5A modification by increasing
putrescine levels.
Myc, which regulates 15% of the genome (27), controls
multiple steps within protein translation, including ribosome
biogenesis and translation initiation, glycolysis, mitochondrial
homeostasis, polyamine biosynthesis, and iron metabolism
(23). Myc has also been shown to cooperate with eIF4E in
transformation (28). Therefore, stabilization of Myc may play
a role in all of the modules identified in this study and may
thus be a central player within bortezomib-induced death of
HCT-116 cells.
Homologous recombination
Many genes associated with HR have oligos that give significant phenotypes within the screen. This result suggests
that the function of HR is important to cell death following
bortezomib treatment. We have shown that bortezomib
potentiates DNA damage signaling as a single agent
(Fig. 3). Prior studies (29–31) have shown that bortezomib

can block HR following DNA damage by another agent. We
suggest that bortezomib also blocks DNA damage repair of
double-stranded breaks occurring during normal replication.
A recent phase 3 trial in multiple myeloma showed that
the combination of bortezomib with melphalan-prednisone
was superior to melphalan-prednisone alone (32). Melphalan
resistance is dependent on HR (33, 34). The ability of bortezomib to inhibit HR could help to explain the clinical superiority of this combination, in agreement with recent studies
in multiple myeloma cells (35), although we did not see
reductions in FANCD2 protein levels.
In conclusion, the genome-wide RNAi study of the determinants of bortezomib sensitivity suggests multiple mechanisms by which proteasome inhibition results in cell death.
Ribosome function is inhibited following proteasome inhibition, particularly translation initiation. Tumor cells have dysregulated translation inhibition and so are not fully protected
by this homeostatic response. Myc stabilization promotes
protein translation, inducing further stress in the tumor cell,
as well as inducing the accumulation of putrescine. BNIP3 is
also stabilized, although the downstream effectors are
unclear. The repair of DNA damage, probably originating
from normal S-phase replication, is inhibited. Stabilization
of p53 promotes cell death. ER stress also seems to contribute to cell death. Because multiple homeostatic responses
are inhibited, the tumor cell engages programmed cell death.
Our initial data are in support of these mechanistic hypotheses and further studies will be needed to confirm these
insights. We anticipate that such studies will improve the
selection of new targets, the design of pharmacodynamic biomarkers, and the application of combination chemotherapy
regimens containing bortezomib.
