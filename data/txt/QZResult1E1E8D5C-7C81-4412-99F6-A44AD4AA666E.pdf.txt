Abstract
Isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) is mutated in various types
of human cancer to IDH1R132H, a structural alteration that leads to
catalysis of a-ketoglutarate to the oncometabolite D-2-hydroxyglutarate. In this study, we present evidence that small-molecule
inhibitors of IDH1R132H that are being developed for cancer
therapy may pose risks with coadministration of radiotherapy.
Cancer cells heterozygous for the IDH1R132H mutation exhibited
less IDH-mediated production of NADPH, such that after exposure to ionizing radiation (IR), there were higher levels of reactive
oxygen species, DNA double-strand breaks, and cell death compared with IDH1 wild-type cells. These effects were reversed by the
IDH1R132H inhibitor AGI-5198. Exposure of IDH1 wild-type cells

to D-2-hydroxyglutarate was sufﬁcient to reduce IDH-mediated
NADPH production and increase IR sensitivity. Mechanistic investigations revealed that the radiosensitivity of heterozygous cells
was independent of the well-described DNA hypermethylation
phenotype in IDH1-mutated cancers. Thus, our results argue that
altered oxidative stress responses are a plausible mechanism
to understand the radiosensitivity of IDH1-mutated cancer
cells. Further, they offer an explanation for the relatively longer
survival of patients with IDH1-mutated tumors, and they imply
that administration of IDH1R132H inhibitors in these patients
may limit irradiation efﬁcacy in this setting. Cancer Res; 75(22);

Introduction

leukemia (AML, 20%), cholangiocarcinoma (20%), chondrosarcoma (60%), and others (1).
IDHMT cause metabolic changes in cancer (2). All IDHMT, of
which IDH1R132H is the most prevalent in glioma, cause loss of
enzymatic wild-type IDH (IDHWT) function (3–5). In addition,
IDHMT have a neo-enzymatic (gain of function) activity: it converts aKG and NADPH to D-2-hydroxyglutarate (D-2HG) and
NADPþ. D-2HG is an oncometabolite that is present in trace
amounts in IDHWT cells but accumulates to levels up to 50
mmol/L in IDHMT cancers (6). Because of the chemical similarities
between D-2HG and aKG, D-2HG competitively inhibits aKGdependent dioxygenases, such as ten-eleven translocation factor
2 (TET2) and JmjC-domain containing histone lysine demethylases (JHKDM; refs. 7, 8). This results in a CpG island methylation
phenotype (CIMP), which alters gene expression and induces
malignant transformation (9).
Patients with IDHMT glioma and cholangiocarcinoma have up
to 3-fold longer median overall survival times than IDHWT counterparts (3, 5, 10–12). Altered patient survival caused by differences in IDH1MT versus IDH1WT tumor biology may be on the
level of intrinsically reduced malignancy, and/or altered responses
to therapy. We previously showed in human glioblastoma samples that IDH1MT are associated with a 38% decrease in IDHmediated NADPH production capacity (5). NADPH is the most
important source of reducing power for cellular detoxiﬁcation of
oxidants, because it is an essential cofactor for the regeneration of
reduced glutathione (GSH) from oxidized glutathione (GSSG) by
glutathione reductase. Therefore, we and others proposed that
altered redox responses result in increased responses to therapy in

IDH1 and lDH2 are homodimeric enzymes that reversibly
convert isocitrate to a-ketoglutarate (aKG) with concomitant
reduction of NADPþ to NADPH in the cytoplasm and mitochondria, respectively (1). Somatic heterozygous hotspot mutations
in IDH1/2 (IDHMT) are observed in substantial percentages of
various tumor types, such as glioma (80%), acute myeloid

IDH1R132H Inhibition Radioprotects IDH1R132H Cells

IDH1MT cancers (1, 13–15). This hypothesis is supported by in
vitro studies, showing that overexpression of IDH1R132H sensitizes
glioma cells to ionizing radiation (IR) or chemotherapy with
carmustine (BCNU), cis-diaminedichloroplatinum (CDDP), or
temozolomide (15–17). In addition, there is clinical evidence that
IDH1MT sensitize glioma to a procarbazine, lomustine (CCNU),
and vincristine (PCV) regimen (18) and sensitize glioblastoma to
a combination of IR and temozolomide (19).
IDHMT are early events in the formation of glioma (20), chondrosarcoma (21), and cholangiocarcinoma (22), which makes
IDHMT attractive therapeutic targets. Inhibitors of IDH1MT and
IDH2MT were recently developed (23–27). Clinical trials of the
IDH1R132H inhibitor AGI-5198 (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02073994)
are in progress in solid tumors. AGI-5198 inhibits IDH1R132H neoenzymatic activity, which decreases D-2HG production in IDH1MT
cells, and thus inhibits carcinogenesis (23). However, better prognosis of patients with established IDHMT glioma or cholangiocarcinoma (which are past the carcinogenesis stage) may be related to
increased anticancer therapy responses by virtue of increased oxidative stress in these tumors due to a lower NADPH production
capacity. Thus, we argued that inhibition of IDHMT decreases this
stress and consequently increases cancer cell survival (1, 2).
The aim of the present study is to provide in vitro evidence that
the prolonged overall survival of glioma patients with IDH1MT
tumors is caused by increases in oxidative stress, and in particular,
reduced NADPH production capacity. We investigated whether
this stress affects the response to IR and metformin. Moreover, we
studied whether the IDH1R132H inhibitor AGI-5198 blocks this
metabolic stress, thus interfering with the survival-prolonging
properties of IDH1MT.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines
HCT116 IDH1WT/R132H knock-in cells, generated by AAV targeting technology GENESIS (28), were kindly provided by Horizon
Discovery Ltd. HT1080 chondrosarcoma cells were a kind gift of
Dr. Hamann (Department of Experimental Immunology, AMC,
University of Amsterdam). U251 and LN229 glioblastoma cells
were stably transduced using lentiviral constructs encoding for
IDH1WT or IDH1R132H as described earlier (29). Constructs contain a C-terminal biotin acceptor peptide and a HIS-tag, which
allows distinction from endogenous IDH1WT by molecular
weight. IDH1WT and IDH1R132H expression was analyzed by
Western blotting using a pan-IDH1 antibody (HPA0352428,
Sigma-Aldrich) and a speciﬁc antibody recognizing IDH1R132H
(30). Western blots were analyzed using a Li-Cor Odyssey system
(Li-Cor Biotechnology).
lDH1WT/R132H and lDH1WT/WT HCT116 cells were cultured in
McCoy's 5A medium (Gibco; Life Technologies; Thermo Fisher
Scientiﬁc) in 5% CO2 at 37 C. U251, LN229, and HT1080 cells
were cultured in 5% CO2, 5% CO2, and 10% CO2, respectively, at
37 C in complete DMEM (Gibco). All media were supplemented
with 10% FBS (HyClone; Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc), 100 units/mL
penicillin, and 100 mg/mL streptomycin (both Gibco).
Reagents
AGI-5198 was purchased from MedChemExpress; L-2HG, D2HG, aKG, coenzyme A, thiamine pyrophosphate, and N-acetyl
cysteine (NAC) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Metformin
was purchased from BioConnect.

Enzyme activity measurements
Cells were cultured in the presence of 200 to 800 nmol/L AGI5198 or solvent only (DMSO, ﬁnal concentration  0.5%) and
subsequently trypsinized and centrifuged onto microscopy slides
using a cytocentrifuge (Cytospin 4 Cytocentrifuge, Shandon,
Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc) at 20 rcf for 5 minutes at room temperature. Cytospins were air-dried for 1 day and subsequently
stained using metabolic mapping to visualize NADþ-dependent
or NADPþ-dependent activities of IDH [EC numbers 1.1.1.41
(IDH3) and 1.1.1.42 (IDH1/2), respectively], NADþ-dependent
activity of aKG dehydrogenase (aKGDH; EC number 1.2.4.2), or
NADPþ-dependent activity of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD; EC number 1.1.1.49). Enzyme activity experiments
were conducted and analyzed as described previously (31, 32).
We used nitrotetrazolium blue chloride (NBT; Sigma-Aldrich) in
the enzyme reaction medium and a 585-nm monochromatic ﬁlter
to exclusively record formazan produced from NBT. Incubation
with substrate and cofactors was performed at 37 C for 60
minutes to detect NADPþ-dependent or NADþ-dependent IDH
activity (30 minutes for tissue), 60 minutes to detect NADþ
-dependent aKGDH activity, and 10 minutes to detect NADPþ
-dependent G6PD activity. Control reactions were performed in
the absence of substrate but in the presence of cofactors to control
for nonspeciﬁc enzyme activity staining (31, 32). Enzyme activity
measurements of cells overexpressing IDH1WT or IDH1R132H were
normalized to enzyme activity measurements of parental cells by
correcting for relative pan-IDH1 expression levels of cells, as
determined by Western blotting.
We used supraphysiological substrate concentrations (up to 30
mmol/L) because the viscous 18% polyvinyl alcohol-containing
enzyme reaction medium does not allow sufﬁcient substrate
diffusion at low concentrations. Thus, the determined enzyme
activities do not reﬂect the in vivo situation at a given substrate
concentration but are suitable for intraexperimental comparisons (31). D-2HG and L-2HG inhibition experiments were
performed in the presence of 1 mmol/L isocitrate or 3 mmol/L
aKG and 30 mmol/L D-2HG or 30 mmol/L L-2HG or solvent
only (double-distilled H2O, ﬁnal concentration  3%) in the
enzyme activity reaction medium. The 2HG:isocitrate and
2HG:aKG ratios used in these experiments are in line with the
pathophysiological conditions in human glioma where D-2HG
concentrations may be up to 100- to 1,000-fold higher than
isocitrate and aKG concentrations (6).
Colony-forming assays after IR
Colony-forming assays after IR were performed and analyzed
as described previously (33). Five to 500 cells/cm2 were seeded;
higher densities are needed at higher IR doses to obtain sufﬁcient amounts of colonies. Cells were treated from 72 hours
before to 4 hours after IR with D-2HG, AGI-5198, the reactive
oxygen species (ROS) scavenger NAC, or solvent only (DMSO,
 0.5%). Cells were irradiated with 1 to 6 Gy using a 137Cs
source (Department of Experimental Oncology and Radiobiology, Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam) at
6 hours after plating in the presence or absence of 0 to 800 nmol/L
AGI-5198, 0 to 10 mmol/L D-2HG, or 0 to 5 mmol/L NAC.
Cells were ﬁxed and stained at 10 days after IR with a mixture
of 0.05% crystal violet (Merck) and 6% glutaraldehyde (Merck)
for  2 hours at room temperature. Clones consisting of 50 cells
were manually counted using a stereoscope (Leica MZ6, Leica
Microsystems; ref. 33). Data are expressed as clonogenic fraction,

which is the number of colonies counted divided by the number
of cells plated, corrected for the plating efﬁciency. D0 and n values
were found by ﬁtting a semilog line through the clonogenic
fraction data points of the ﬁnal slope. Dq values were found by
solving the semilog line equation for 1.
Epigenome-wide DNA methylation analysis
Cells were lysed and genomic DNA was isolated as described
previously (34). Genomic DNA was bisulﬁte-converted using the
EZ DNA Methylation Gold Kit (Zymo Research). Bisulﬁte-converted DNA was analyzed for epigenome-wide DNA methylation
analysis using an Inﬁnium HumanMethylation 450 BeadChip
array (Illumina). This array includes over 450,000 CpG sites that
cover approximately 99% of the RefSeq genes. Analysis was
performed in the MinFI R-package (R statistical programming
language), and samples were normalized using the SWAN method (35). Normalized b-values were evaluated. Values are between
0 and 1, which stand for a completely unmethylated and methylated probe, respectively.
Cellular NADPþ, NADPH, GSH, GSSG, and ROS measurements
106 cells were plated in a 6-well plate, incubated in the presence
or absence of 800 nmol/L AGI-5198, and treated with 0 to 2 Gy IR.
After 60 minutes, cells were harvested, prepared, and analyzed for
NADPþ/NADPH ratios, GSH/GSSG ratios, and ROS levels using a
colorimetric NADPþ/NADPH Ratio Detection Assay Kit (Abcam),
a ﬂuorometric GSH/GSSG Ratio Detection Assay Kit (Abcam),
and a ﬂuorometric CellROX Deep Red ROS detection assay kit
(Life Technologies), respectively, in a 96-well plate using a
POLARStar Galaxy microplate reader (BMG Labtech) according
to the manufacturers' protocols. In addition, cells were analyzed
for ROS levels using a CellROX Deep Red ROS detection assay kit
(Life Technologies) in an LSR Fortessa ﬂuorescence ﬂow cytometry analyzer (BD Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's
protocol. Cells were counterstained using a SYTOX Blue Dead Cell
Stain (Life Technologies). Data were processed in FACSDiva (BD
Biosciences) and analyzed in FlowJo (FlowJo).
g-H2AX immunoﬂuorescence staining and measurements
DNA double-strand breaks (DSB) kinetics were studied using
g-H2AX foci immunoﬂuorescence staining (36). Cells were plated
on glass coverslips in a 6-well plate, incubated in the presence or
absence of 800 nmol/L AGI-5198, and treated with 0 to 2 Gy IR,
washed with PBS and ﬁxed after 30 minutes using 2% paraformaldehyde for 15 minutes. Cells were permeabilized with pTNBS
(PBS containing 1% Triton X-100 and 1% FCS) for 1 hour and
stained for g-H2AX foci using a mouse monoclonal anti–g-H2AX
antibody [Millipore; diluted 1:100 in sTNBS (PBS containing 0.1%
Triton X-100 and 1% FCS)] for 90 min at room temperature. Cover
slips were washed with sTNBS and stained using secondary goat
anti-mouse Cy3 antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch, diluted

R132H

1:100 in sTNBS) for 30 minutes at room temperature in the dark.
Lastly, cover slips were washed with sTNBS, and nuclei were stained
with DAPI (Millipore, 1:500) for 2 minutes at room temperature.
Cover slips were mounted to microscopy slides using Vectashield
(Vector Laboratories). Nail polish was used as sealant.
The number of g-H2AX foci per cell was determined using a
Leica DM RA HC ﬂuorescence microscope equipped with a CCD
camera and a 100 objective Plan Apochromatic lens with 1.40
numerical aperture (Leica Microsystems). Cy3 and DAPI signals
were captured using excitation/emission wavelengths of 550/570
nm for 400 ms and 360/460 nm for 50 ms, respectively. Photomicrographs were obtained using custom-made software (Van
Leeuwenhoek Center for Advanced Microscopy, Academic Medical Center, Amsterdam, the Netherlands). Stack images of at least
200 cells per sample were taken. One stack consisted of 40 slices
with a 300-nm interval between the slices along the z-axis. The
images were processed using deconvolution software, and the
number of g-H2AX foci per cell was automatically scored using
custom-made software.

Results
IDH1MT reduce IDH-mediated NADPH production and IR
tolerance in vitro
NADPþ-dependent IDH activity was signiﬁcantly lower in
lDH1WT/R132H HCT116 cells than in lDH1WT/WT HCT116 cells
(Fig. 1A; Supplementary Fig. S1A). The reduced IDH-mediated
NADPH production capacity of IDH1MT cells was conﬁrmed in
U251 and LN229 glioblastoma cell lines that stably overexpressed
IDH1WT or IDH1R132H (Fig. 1B–D). Cells overexpressing IDH1WT
had a higher IDH-mediated NADPH production capacity than
parental glioblastoma cells.
The vulnerability of lDH1WT/R132H and lDH1WT/WT HCT116 cells
to IR was investigated using colony-forming assays. Relative to
IDH1WT/WT cells, we observed a signiﬁcantly reduced surviving
fraction of IDH1WT/R132H cells at all IR doses (Fig. 1E), i.e.,
IDH1R132H radiosensitizes HCT116 cells. We hypothesized that the
increased radiosensitivity of lDH1WT/R132H HCT116 cells was caused
by increased vulnerability to oxidative stress, which is a result of
reduced IDH-mediated NADPH production capacity. To test this, we
treated lDH1WT/R132H and lDH1WT/WT HCT116 cells with the
NADPH surrogate and ROS scavenger NAC at 4 hours before IR.

NAC equalized the surviving fractions of lDH1WT/R132H and
IDH1WT/WT HCT116 cells (Fig. 1F). This suggests that oxidative
stress mediates the increased radiosensitivity of lDH1WT/R132H
HCT116 cells. The culture medium McCoy 5A contains 0.5 mg/L
reduced glutathione, which may affect redox potentials of HCT116
and therefore their IR response. We conﬁrmed the increased radiosensitivity of lDH1WT/R132H HCT116 cells in DMEM medium, which
contains no reduced glutathione (Supplementary Fig. S1B).
IDHMT induce CIMP after long-term passaging of cells (9).
CIMP has profound effects on gene expression and, theoretically,
this could alter IR sensitivity. We compared genome-wide methylation levels in early-passage (P3) and late-passage (P30)
lDH1WT/R132H and lDH1WT/WT HCT116 cells and observed a
relative CIMP in P30 compared with P3 lDH1WT/R132H HCT116
cells. Long-term culture did not induce CIMP in lDH1WT/WT
HCT116 cells (Fig. 1G). IR sensitivity of P30 lDH1WT/R132H
HCT116 cells (Fig. 1H) did not differ from IR sensitivity of P3
lDH1WT/R132H HCT116 cells (Fig. 1E), and IR sensitivity is thus not
related to CIMP. Statistics and Dq, n, and D0 values for all colonyforming assays are shown in Supplementary Tables S1 and S2.
D-2HG sensitizes cells to IR and inhibits IDH-mediated NADPH
production
A hallmark of IDHMT cancer is D-2HG accumulation (1, 6),
and D-2HG is known to induce oxidative stress in glia, neurons
(37–39), and Drosophila (40). Therefore, we considered the
possibility that D-2HG is responsible for the sensitization of
lDH1WT/R132H HCT116 cells to IR. lDH1WT/WT and lDH1WT/R132H
HCT116 cells were exposed to D-2HG from 4 hours before to
4 hours after IR treatment. D-2HG signiﬁcantly decreased the
clonogenic fractions of lDH1WT/WT and lDH1WT/R132H HCT116
cells after IR (Fig. 2A), i.e., D-2HG radiosensitizes HCT116
cells. Of note, the radiosensitizing effect of D-2HG was larger in
lDH1WT/WT than in lDH1WT/R132H HCT116 cells, in line with preexisting endogenous D-2HG in lDH1WT/R132H HCT116 cells.
D-2HG and L-2HG are competitive inhibitors of aKG-dependent enzymes (7, 8, 41). The structural similarity between isocitrate, aKG, and D-2HG led us to hypothesize that high levels of
D-2HG in IDHMT cancers inhibit IDH-mediated NADPH production capacity. To study this, we performed enzyme activity experiments in the presence and absence of D-2HG or L-2HG. D-2HG
and L-2HG reduced the IDH-mediated NADPH production
capacity in lDH1WT/WT and lDH1WT/R132H HCT116 cells, U251
glioblastoma cells, and IDH1WT and IDH1MT human glioblastoma tissue (n ¼ 8; Fig. 2B–E); this inhibition was dose-dependent
(Supplementary Fig. S2A). In addition, D-2HG and L-2HG
inhibited the aKGDH-mediated NADH production capacity
in IDH1WT and IDH1MT human glioblastoma tissue (n ¼ 8; Fig.
2E and F). For both IDH and aKGDH, L-2HG was a more
efﬁcient IDH inhibitor than D-2HG. These results indicate that
D-2HG and L-2HG are inhibitors of IDH-mediated NADPH
production capacity. D-2HG and L-2HG did not affect G6PDmediated NADPH production capacity or IDH-dependent
NADH production capacity, indicating absence of off-target
effects (Supplementary Fig. S2B and S2C).
The IDH1MT inhibitor AGI-5198 restores IDH-mediated
NADPH production in IDH1MT cells
Since the introduction of IDH1R132H increases metabolic stress
via a reduced NADPH production capacity, we hypothesized that
IDH1R132H inhibition reverses this effect. Indeed, after 72 hours of

4794 Cancer Res; 75(22) November 15, 2015

incubation in the presence of AGI-5198, IDH-mediated NADPH
production capacity of lDH1WT/R132H HCT116 cells was restored
to levels comparable with those of lDH1WT/WT HCT116 cells (Fig.
3A). In contrast, no effect was detected after 4 hours of incubation
with AGI-5198 (Fig. 3B) or in lDH1WT/R132H HCT116 cells that
were treated with AGI-5198 after adherence to microscopical
slides (Supplementary Fig. S3A). This suggests that AGI-5198
restores IDH-mediated NADPH production capacity after relieving IDH1WT/R132H cells of high D-2HG concentrations. We validated these results in IDH1R132H U251 and LN229 cells (Fig. 3C
and D). IDH1R132H U251 cells needed the highest AGI-5198 doses
for restoration of IDH-mediated NADPH production capacity,
followed by IDH1R132H LN229 cells, followed by IDH1WT/R132H
HCT116 cells. This may relate to higher IDH1R132H expression in
U251 than in LN299 cells and higher IDH1R132H expression in
IDH1R132H-overexpressing cells than in IDH1WT/R132H knock-in
cells (Fig. 1B; Supplementary Fig. S1C). Larger amounts of
IDH1R132H protein may require higher AGI-5198 doses for complete IDH1R132H inhibition. There was no effect after 72-hour
incubation with AGI-5198 on NADPþ-dependent IDH activity in
lDH1WT/WT HCT116 cells (Fig. 3E and F) or NADþ-dependent
IDH3 activity in lDH1WT/R132H HCT116 cells (Supplementary Fig.
S3D), in agreement with AGI-5198 speciﬁcity for IDH1R132H (23).
Because AGI-5198 inhibits IDH1R132C as well, although at higher
concentrations than IDH1R132H (23), we conﬁrmed our results in
IDH1WT/R132C HT1080 cells (Supplementary Fig. S3C and S3D).
IDH1MT decrease NADPH and GSH levels and increase ROS
levels and AGI-5198 attenuates this effect
We investigated the effects of IDH1MT on cellular NADPH,
GSH, and ROS levels with and without pretreatment with IR.
Under steady-state conditions, lDH1WT/R132H HCT116 cells had
similar NADPþ/NADPH ratios, GSH/GSSG ratios, and ROS levels
as lDH1WT/WT HCT116 cells, as determined by colorimetric and
ﬂuorometric assays and ﬂuorescence ﬂow cytometry experiments
(Fig. 4A–D; Supplementary Fig. S4). After treatment with 2 Gy IR,
we observed an increase in the NADPþ/NADPH ratio (owing to
more NADPþ and/or less NADPH), a decrease in the GSH/GSSG
ratio (owing to less GSH and/or more GSSG), and an increase in
ROS levels in all cell lines. Notably, the increase in the NADPþ/
NADPH ratio and ROS levels and the decrease in the GSH/GSSG
ratio were larger in lDH1WT/R132H than in lDH1WT/WT HCT116
cells, and the IDH1MT inhibitor AGI-5198 attenuated this effect in
lDH1WT/R132H HCT116 cells (Fig. 4C and D). These ﬁndings
suggest that compared with lDH1WT/WT HCT116 cells, the higher
ROS levels in lDH1WT/R132H HCT116 cells after IR result in a higher
GSH and NADPH consumption.
AGI-5198 protects IDH1MT cells against IR
Because reduced NADPH production capacity in lDH1WT/R132H
cells is associated with radiosensitization (Fig. 1), we hypothesized that by restoring NADPH production capacity in lDH1MT
cells, the lDH1MT inhibitor AGI-5198 radioprotects IDH1MT cells.
Therefore, we exposed lDH1WT/R132H and lDH1WT/WT HCT116
cells to AGI-5198 for 72 hours before IR. AGI-5198 did not affect
radiosensitivity of lDH1WT/WT HCT116 cells, but reduced radiosensitivity of lDH1WT/R132H HCT116 cells, in a dose-dependent
fashion, to radiosensitivity levels comparable with those of
lDH1WT/WT HCT116 cells (Fig. 5A and B). These data show that
AGI-5198 radioprotects lDH1WT/R132H HCT116 cells and that
high AGI-5198 doses completely block IDH1R132H-induced

agreement with our ﬁnding that higher AGI-5198 doses were
needed to restore the IDH-mediated NADPH production capacity

IDH1MT increase sensitivity to metformin and AGI-5198

We wondered whether the increased sensitivity of
lDH1WT/R132H HCT116 cells was speciﬁc to IR or also applicable
to other treatment modalities that induce stress. IDH1MT cells are
sensitized to antidiabetic biguanides such as metformin (42, 43),
which also depend on oxidative stress to induce cell death (44).
We treated lDH1WT/R132H and lDH1WT/WT HCT116 cells with 0 to
6 mmol/L metformin in a proliferation experiment. Relative to
untreated cells, we observed less lDH1WT/R132H than lDH1WT/WT
HCT116 cells after metformin treatment (Supplementary Fig. S5).
Moreover, lDH1WT/R132H HCT116 cells that were treated with
both AGI-5198 and metformin proliferated more than
lDH1WT/R132H HCT116 cells treated with metformin alone. This
indicates that lDH1WT/R132H HCT116 cells are sensitized to stress

Discussion

4796 Cancer Res; 75(22) November 15, 2015

We showed that introduction of IDH1R132H results in D-2HG
accumulation, inhibits IDHWT function, and sensitizes cells to
IR and metformin. The overall process can thus be described as a
D-2HG-NADPH-therapy sensitivity cascade for IDH1MT cancer
cells (Fig. 7). Inhibition of IDH1MT by AGI-5198 disrupts this
cascade at the level of D-2HG production, which enhances the
capacity of IDH1MT cells to reduce oxidative stress and protects
them against IR and metformin.
Patients with glioma or cholangiocarcinoma tumors carrying
IDHMT have prolonged overall survival compared with IDHWT
counterparts (3, 5, 10, 11). This can be attributed to intrinsic (e.g.,
less aggressive tumors) and/or extrinsic (e.g., better response to
therapy) differences in IDHMT versus IDHWT cancers. Our data
support a correlation between IDHMT and response to therapy,

which has been shown by others, both in vitro (15–17) and
retrospectively in the clinic (18, 19). Our novel ﬁnding is that
D-2HG accumulation, as occurs in IDH1MT cancers, directly
radiosensitizes cancer cells via inhibition of IDH-mediated
NADPH production capacity and that this is associated with
increased numbers of DNA DSBs after IR. Thus, the prolonged
survival effects of IDHMT in glioma patients may, at least partly, be
the result of a relative radiosensitivity of IDH1MT cancer cells.
IDHMT confer a worse prognosis in AML patients (45). One
difference between AML and glioma is that IR is typically not used
to treat AML, whereas it is routinely used as a treatment modality
for glioma. Cytarabine and daunorubicin are used to treat AML
and operate by DNA synthesis chain termination and topoisomerase activity, which cause cell death independent of ROS formation. Furthermore, D-2HG accumulation in AML cells has likely
less biologic impact since NADPH production in leukocytes is
largely attributable to activity of G6PD, not IDH1/2 (46). In
contrast, IDH1/2 is responsible for 65% of NADPH production
in glioblastoma, and IDH1MT decrease NADPH production capacity by 38% (5), making these tumors dependent on IDH1/2 for
reducing power.

4798 Cancer Res; 75(22) November 15, 2015

In addition to glioblastoma and chondrosarcoma cell lines,
we used HCT116 colorectal carcinoma cells as in vitro model.
Although IDH1MT are not as prevalent in colorectal carcinoma as
in glioma, chondrosarcoma, or cholangiocarcinoma, they do occur
in 0.5% of patients (47). Thus, IDH1MT may affect colorectal cancer
cells similarly to glioma, cholangiocarcinoma, and chondrosarcoma cells. Because IDH1R132H functions as a heterodimer with
IDH1WT, 1:1 IDH1R132H:IDH1WT expression in IDH1WT/R132H
HCT116 cells is more true to nature than IDH1R132H overexpression. Previous reports (3, 5) have shown that the loss-of-function
effects of IDH1MT are responsible for reduced IDH-mediated
NADPH production capacity in IDH1MT tumors. In cancer cells,
IDH1R132H mutations are heterozygous, i.e., cells lose one functional NADPH-producing allele. In addition, the net NADPH
production in IDH1MT cells is further reduced via NADPH consumption by IDH1R132H (6). However, reductive hydroxylation of
aKG by IDH1R132H occurs 100 to 1,000 times slower than the
oxidative decarboxylation by IDHWT (6, 48), so such compounding is likely negligible. The present study shows that IDH1MT reduce
NADPH production capacity through a third mechanism:
IDH1R132H-produced D-2HG inhibits IDHWT. This supports earlier

ﬁndings that IDH1MT inhibit catalytic IDH1WT function in a
dominant-negative fashion (4). We show that this dominantnegative inhibition is mediated by D-2HG. Another, but not
mutually exclusive, explanation is that this dominant-negative
inhibition is mediated by dysfunctional IDH1WT-IDH1R132H heterodimers (49). In addition to IDHWT, D-2HG inhibits aKGDH
and cytochrome C oxidase (complex IV of the electron transport
chain; ref. 50), which further compromises tricarboxylic acid cycle
metabolism in IDHMT cells. AGI-5198 did not protect lDH1WT/
R132H
HCT116 cells against IR when exogenous D-2HG was
administered. This supports the notion that NADPH consumption
by IDH1R132H does not radiosensitize lDH1WT/R132H HCT116 cells.
Of note, L-2HG was a more potent inhibitor than D-2HG of IDH
and aKGDH. This corroborates studies that showed that L-2HG is a
more potent inhibitor than D-2HG of aKG-dependent enzymes,
such as TET2, JHKDMs, and EGLN (7, 8).
AGI-5198 restored IDH-mediated NADPH production capacity
and radioresistance of IDH1MT cells, and both effects are likely the
result of AGI-5198-inhibited D-2HG synthesis. High-dose AGI5198 completely abolishes D-2HG accumulation (23) and
completely rescued the radiosensitivity of lDH1WT/R132H HCT116
cells. Oxidative stress is a likely mediator of IDH1WT/R132H radio-

sensitization in HCT116 cells, because the ROS scavenger NAC
normalized the radiosensitivity of IDH1WT/R132H HCT116 cells to
levels of IDH1WT/WT HCT116 cells. In addition, IDH1MT cells were
also sensitized for treatment with metformin, whereas AGI-5198
protected IDH1MT cells against metformin. This is in agreement
with the fact that mitochondrial inhibitors such as metformin
depend on oxidative stress to induce cell death (44). Previous
reports have shown that D-2HG induces cellular oxidative stress
(37–40), although the underlying mechanisms remained elusive
thus far. Our data indicate that inhibition of IDH-mediated
NADPH production capacity and aKGDH-mediated NADH production capacity by D-2HG and the resulting metabolic stress is, at
least partly, responsible for this phenomenon. Our ﬁndings that
D-2HG and L-2HG inhibit the activity of IDHWT and aKGDH
suggest that this inhibition is due to the chemical similarities
between D-2HG, L-2HG, and aKG.
Long-lasting exposures of AGI-5198 (72 hours) radioprotected
IDH1MT cells but short exposures (4 hours) did not. These data
corroborate our quantitative enzyme histochemistry results where
72-hour exposure to high doses of AGI-5198 completely restored
IDH-mediated NADPH production capacity of lDH1MT cells, but
4-hour exposures did not. This indicates that there is a delaying

intermediate that causes lagged AGI-5198–induced restoration of
IDH-mediated NADPH production capacity and radioresistance.
Our ﬁndings suggest that D-2HG is this intermediate and that D2HG is metabolized slowly. This supports speculations that the
activity of D-2HG dehydrogenase (D-2HGDH) is low (51). In
addition, it is accordant with the ﬁnding that ML309, an IDH1MT
inhibitor similar to AGI-5198, maximally suppresses D-2HG
concentrations when applied for at least 24 hours (25).
IDH1MT decreased NADPH and GSH levels and increased ROS
levels, but only when cells were treated with IR. This corroborates
earlier studies in which IDH1MT decreased NADPH and GSH levels
and increased ROS in glioblastoma cells after treatment with
temozolomide and CDDP (15), but not in a transgenic mouse
model or glioblastoma cells under steady-state conditions
(15, 52). Taken together, our results suggest that in contexts of
stress, such as after treatment with IR, the cellular demand for GSH
increases. As a consequence, the demand for NADPH increases, but
IDH1MT compromise the cellular NADPH production capacity,
and this restricts recycling of GSSG to GSH enough to cause higher
ROS levels, i.e., it causes a scenario in which NADPH demand
outweighs NADPH supply. In all, our results suggest that altered
oxidative stress response is the most likely downstream element of
D-2HG that results in IDHMT radiosensitivity. Oxidative stress can
either directly induce cell death after treatment with IR, or indirectly via DNA DSBs. On average, IDH1WT/R132H HCT116 cells had
twice the amount of DNA DSBs of IDH1WT/WT HCT116 cells after
treatment with 2 Gy IR, but the amount of DNA DSBs was only
slightly increased in IDH1WT/R132H compared with IDH1WT/WT
HCT116 cells after treatment with 1 Gy IR. This resonates with
a larger radiosensitivity of IDH1MT cells relative to IDH1WT cells
after treatment with  2 Gy IR than after treatment with 1 Gy IR.

4800 Cancer Res; 75(22) November 15, 2015

Further research is needed to assess whether this is due to increased
generation of DSBs by oxidative stress, or decreased DNA DSB
repair, and whether IDHMT cancers are sensitized to anticancer
therapy that targets DNA DSB repair, such as PARP inhibitors.
CIMP did not affect the radiosensitivity of IDHMT cells, which
argues against a role for epigenetics in this phenomenon. Moreover, long-term AGI-5198 treatment does not reverse CIMP in
IDHMT glioma cells (23), and this further precludes a link between
CIMP and IDHMT radiosensitivity, because AGI-5198 reverses
IDHMT radiosensitization already after 72 hours.
Clinical trials with IDHMT inhibitors have already started in
patients with IDHMT cancer. Our data show that AGI-5198 antagonizes the possibly survival-prolonging radiosensitizing effects of
IDH1MT in glioma. Our in vitro results suggest that concomitant
administration of IDHMT inhibitors and IR may result in an
unfavorable clinical outcome. In vivo validation is urgently necessary as IDHMT inhibitors are already in clinical trials. These
limitations may also apply to other therapeutic strategies that
include a combination of IDHMT inhibition with anticancer
agents whose activity is mediated by oxidative stress. More speciﬁcally, we warn against simultaneous treatment with IDHMT
inhibitors and IR. Instead, we envision treatments in which
conventional treatment modalities are applied subsequently, but
not concomitantly, with IDHMT inhibitors. IDHMT inhibitors may
be of clinical use when patients are in periods of recovery from
conventional anticancer drugs whose activity is mediated by
oxidative stress. We propose that personalized medicine for
IDH1MT solid tumors should aim to increase, not decrease,
oxidative stress. This may be achieved by antitumor immune
responses after immunization of patients with an IDH1R132H
peptide (53), causing inﬂammatory ROS, or physical exercise,

causing mitochondrial ROS (54). In addition, other Achilles'
heels in IDHMT metabolism could be exploited, such as mitochondrial dysfunction (50), increased dependence on glutaminolysis (2, 55–59) and oxidative phosphorylation (42, 43). These
vulnerabilities can be pharmacologically targeted via BCL-2 inhibitors, chloroquine, and metformin, respectively.
In summary, our data show that AGI-5198 radioprotects
IDH1MT cancer cells. Administration of IDHMT inhibitors during
IR may thus abolish the prolonged survival of IDHMT glioma
patients. We warn against multiagent clinical trials with concomitant use of IDHMT inhibitors and IR.
