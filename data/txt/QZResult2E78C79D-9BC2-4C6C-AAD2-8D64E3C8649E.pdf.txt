Emerging Potential of Therapeutic Targeting of UbiquitinSpeciﬁc Proteases in the Treatment of Cancer
Anupama Pal1, Matthew A. Young2, and Nicholas J. Donato3

Abstract
The ubiquitin–proteasome system (UPS) has emerged as a therapeutic focus and target for the treatment
of cancer. The most clinically successful UPS-active agents (bortezomib and lenalidomide) are limited in
application to hematologic malignancies, with only marginal efﬁcacy in solid tumors. Inhibition of speciﬁc
ubiquitin E3 ligases has also emerged as a valid therapeutic strategy, and many targets are currently being
investigated. Another emerging and promising approach in regulation of the UPS involves targeting
deubiquitinases (DUB). The DUBs comprise a relatively small group of proteins, most with cysteine protease
activity that target several key proteins involved in regulation of tumorigenesis, apoptosis, senescence, and
autophagy. Through their multiple contacts with ubiquitinated protein substrates involved in these pathways, DUBs provide an untapped means of modulating many important regulatory proteins that support
oncogenic transformation and progression. Ubiquitin-speciﬁc proteases (USP) are one class of DUBs that
have drawn special attention as cancer targets, as many are differentially expressed or activated in tumors or
their microenvironment, making them ideal candidates for drug development. This review attempts to
summarize the USPs implicated in different cancers, the current status of USP inhibitor–mediated
pharmacologic intervention, and future prospects for USP inhibitors to treat diverse cancers. Cancer Res;

Introduction
Most of the current molecular cancer therapies target
protein kinases and mediate their antitumor activity through
the deactivation of an aberrantly expressed, tumor-dependent,
or unregulated target enzyme. Clinically successful kinasetargeting examples include Herceptin (Her2), imatinib (BcrAbl and c-Kit), vemurafenib (BRAF), and ibrutinib (BTK; ref. 1).
However, kinase inhibition has restricted application and
limited long-standing efﬁcacy, as intrinsic resistance reduces
beneﬁt to only a fraction of patients and most responders will
acquire resistance due to additional mutations or activation of
compensating pathways (1). A deeper understanding of the
molecular pathways associated with cancer has implicated
posttranslation regulation through ubiquitination/deubiquitination of many target proteins as an additional and attractive
targeted therapeutic approach.

Ubiquitin Proteasome System-Targeted
Anticancer Therapeutics
Covalent attachment of ubiquitin, a 76–amino acid
protein, to a target protein is a means of regulating protein
half-life, localization, and activity. Because protein homeostasis is essential for the survival of all cells, but more
essential to cancer cells, modulation of individual ubiquitin–proteasome system (UPS) components may present an
opportunity for therapeutic targeting. As proof-of-principle,
many compounds with proteasome inhibitory activity
have been developed, including bortezomib (or Velcade;
Millenium Pharmaceuticals), which is a synthetic dipeptide
boronic acid that reversibly inhibits the chymotryptic-like
activity of the 20S enzymatic core of the proteasome and
induces apoptosis in several malignancies. Velcade is
approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) for the treatment of patients with mantle cell lymphoma and multiple myeloma, even those resistant to
doxorubicin, mitoxantrone, melphalan, and dexamethasone,
and is commonly used in combination with many of these
agents (2). Ampliﬁed protein synthesis (immunoglobulin)
in many myeloma cells may underlie their clinical sensitivity to bortezomib and other proteasome inhibitors as
most solid tumors do not have a similar commitment
to elevated protein synthesis and are not clinically
responsive to these drugs. This narrow therapeutic application, combined with some toxicity (sensory neuropathy),
may be circumvented by novel proteasome inhibitory molecules (2).

Deubiquitinases as Emerging Targets for
Anticancer therapeutics
Targeted inhibition of ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes and
ligases could provide another therapeutic avenue. Inhibition of
NEDD8-associated E1 enzyme by MLN4924, E2 enzyme hCdc34
by CC0651, and E3 ligase MDM2 by RITA (NSC652287) and
MI-219 reﬂects this ongoing effort (3). Deubiquitinases (DUB)
are another class of emerging anticancer target that regulate
speciﬁc substrate proteins by reversing their ubiquitination
through the hydrolysis of isopeptide or a-peptide bonds linking ubiquitin to the target protein (4). If the target protein is an
oncogene, the DUB activity of the associated DUB may stabilize
its cellular expression and supports identiﬁcation of DUB
inhibitors that could reestablish normal protein turnover,
location, or activity (4). This approach may also avoid the
deleterious side effects associated with direct targeting of the
proteasome. With around 55 members, ubiquitin-speciﬁc proteases (USP) comprise the largest and most diverse family of
DUBs. Genetic and/or functional analysis have placed USPs in
the category of cancer-associated proteases, and their unique
biochemical structures have made them desirable targets for
anticancer therapies. More than 30 USPs have been associated
with cancer directly or indirectly. These numbers are not
surprising, considering the various critical cellular functions
regulated by different USPs and the diversity of substrates used
and regulated by them. A comprehensive list of USPs altered in
different cancers is provided in Table 1.

Role of Ubiquitin Speciﬁc Proteases in Cancer
USP-associated mutations and gene fusions in
hematologic malignancies
Recurrent mutations of USPs are rare in cancer with the
exception of CYLD. Germline mutations of the tumor-suppressor gene CYLD are prevalent in familial cylindromatosis, a
genetic condition that leads to predisposition for developing
multiple skin tumors (5). The only known chromosomal translocation involving a USP is the fusion of the promoter of CDH11
to the full-length USP6 gene that leads to upregulated transcript
levels of USP6 (6). USP gene fusions are reported for USP42 and
USP16 that are fusion gene partners with RUNX, which has highfrequency gene alterations in hematologic diseases such as
chronic myelomonocytic leukemia and acute myeloid leukemia
(AML; refs. 7, 8). USP18 transcript levels are upregulated in mice
expressing the AML fusion protein AML1–ETO (9). USP33/
VDU1 mRNA levels are overexpressed in B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias (10). Increased mRNA levels of USP50 have
also been reported in AML (11). Upregulated transcript levels of
USP9x have been correlated with poor prognosis in multiple
myeloma and are associated with Mcl-1 accumulation in
patients with follicular lymphoma (12). Thus, USPs are repeatedly implicated in many hematologic malignancies.
USPs as important regulators of p53 signaling and DNA
damage response
An important aspect of hematopoietic tumors is that p53
mutations are rare; however, p53 levels are tightly regulated by
ubiquitination/deubiquitination (13). Thus, modulation of p53

4956

Cancer Res; 74(18) September 15, 2014

levels in these tumors can provide a therapeutic advantage by
inducing p53-dependent apoptosis and cell-cycle arrest. A key
molecule involved in p53 ubiquitination is the E3 ligase MDM2,
which is a negative regulator of p53 stability (13). Although
USP7 and USP2a have been reported to deubiquitinate MDM2,
leading to degradation of p53 and antiapoptotic activity, USP7
and USP10 can directly deubiquitinate p53 under speciﬁc
conditions (14, 15). Under normal conditions, USP7 stabilizes
MDM2 and leads to degradation of p53, whereas USP10
deubiquitinates and stabilizes p53. In response to DNA damage
and following ATM kinase activation, the substrate preference
of USP7 switches from MDM2 to p53, leading to its stabilization (14, 16). Similarly, in response to DNA damage, USP10 is
stabilized in an ATM kinase-dependent manner and a portion
of it translocates to the nucleus where it joins USP7 in
deubiquitinating and stabilizing p53. Other USPs known to
regulate p53 levels in the cell include USP4 and USP5 (17, 18).
USP4 reduces p53 levels in the cell through direct binding and
deubiquitination of the E3 ligase HUWE1, also called MULE or
ARF-BP1 (17). USP5 depletion in the cell leads to accumulation
of unanchored polyubiquitin chains, competing with p53 for
proteasomal destruction, which results in nuclear accumulation of p53 and transcriptional activation of p53 target genes
(18). Very recently, USP15 was shown to target MDM2 with
effects on the stability of both p53 and the T-cell transcription
factor, NFATc. Thus, USP15 inhibition could result in direct
tumor cell apoptosis and increased T-cell responsiveness (19).
Because ubiquitination/deubiquitination is also an important mechanism essential for regulation of the DNA-damage
repair (DDR), a large number of USPs are implicated in
regulating or coordinating DDR. USP3, USP7, USP10, USP11,
USP16, USP21, and USP22 are reported to regulate DDR sensor
proteins. USP1, USP2, USP4, USP7, USP10, USP11, USP24,
USP29, and USP47 are directly implicated in the regulation of
DDR repair proteins (20). Single-strand DNA breaks are
repaired by nucleotide excision repair (NER) and base excision
repair (BER) pathways that deal with various DNA helix-distorting lesions and single-strand breaks; mismatch repair
pathways that repair base mismatches and insertions/deletions; the nonhomologous end-joining pathway (NHEJ) and/or
homologous recombination (HR) pathways, and the Fanconi
anemia (FA) pathway, which in conjunction with certain HR
factors act to recognize and repair inter-strand cross-links
(ICL) DNA lesions. USP1 and USP7 act in multiple DDR pathways. USP1 removes monoubiquitin from FANCD2 and PCNA,
and thus regulate ICL and trans-lesional DNA synthesis (20).
USP1 levels are well regulated during the cell cycle and their
depletion leads to genomic instability. USP1 knockouts show
defects in FA and HR repair (21). Like USP1, USP7 also acts in
multiple DDR pathways. In response to DSB, the DSB sensor
kinase ATM is activated, which leads to downregulation of
USP7S, a USP7 isoform, resulting in the activation of a p53
response and regulation of the G2–M checkpoint (20). USP7 is
also a major regulator of the oxidative stress response. Through
its deubiquitinating activity, USP7 can modulate FOXO4 transcriptional activity in response to oxidative stress. USP7 can
also modulate BER of oxidative lesions through chromatin
remodeling directly by deubiquitination of histones, or

indirectly by regulating the cellular levels of E3 ubiquitin
ligases involved in histone ubiquitination. USP29 also mediates
the oxidative stress response by stabilizing p53 in a FBP/JTV1–
dependent manner. USP7 is also implicated in transcriptioncoupled NER (TCNER), a subpathway of NER that efﬁciently
removes highly toxic RNA polymerase II blocking lesions on
DNA causing Cockayne syndrome and UV-sensitive syndrome
(UVSS). Apart from USP7, USP47 is the only other DUB that is
reported to regulate BER through the stabilization of newly
synthesized polymerase b (Pol-b). USP47-silenced cells show
aberrant DDR growth inhibition and chemosensitization. USP3
and USP16 deubiquitinate histone H2A and USP16 also
opposes the RNF8–RNF18 pathway–mediated DDR to double-strand breaks (DSB), leading to accumulation of replication
stress in the cell. USP24 stabilizes DDB2, also called p48, which
is an important protein in the recognition and repair of UVinduced lesions in the NER pathway (22). In response to DNA
damage, USP28 binds with 53BP1 and its loss induces ionizing
radiation–induced apoptosis. USP44 has been identiﬁed as a
DUB critical for spindle assembly checkpoint activity and in
centrosome regulation. USP44-deﬁcient mice are susceptible
to spontaneous tumors of the lung, supporting a role for USP44
as a tumor-suppressor gene (reviewed in ref. 20). These ﬁndings are especially noteworthy because current radiation and
chemotherapy regimens used for the treatment of various
cancers rely heavily on inducing DNA damage to the cancer
cell. Developing speciﬁc or even partially speciﬁc inhibitors
that can target several USPs, resulting in cell-cycle arrest or
apoptosis, in the cancer cell may be advantageous.
USPs as regulators of cancer-associated pathways
USPs are also implicated as important regulators of several
cancer-associated pathways. The NF-kB pathway is constitutively activated in a vast range of cancers and is implicated in
tumorigenesis and metastasis. Several USPs are reported as
negative regulators of NF-kB signaling. CYLD binds to the
NEMO component of the IkB kinase complex and regulates its
activity through deubiquitination of TRAF2. Inhibition of
CYLD increases resistance to apoptosis, an effect that can be
relieved by inhibiting NF-kB activity using aspirin derivatives
(23). USP31 has also been identiﬁed as a TRAF2-interacting
protein that regulates NF-kB activation by members of the
TNF receptor superfamily (24). USP4 directly interacts and
exerts deubiquitinating activity on multiple NF-kB pathway–
associated molecules, such as TRAF2, TRAF6, and TAK1
kinase, and negatively regulates TNFa and IL1b-induced cancer cell migration. USP4 negatively regulates receptor-interacting protein 1 (RIP1)–mediated NF-kB activation and promotes TNFa-induced apoptosis in head and neck squamous
cell carcinomas through direct interaction with RIP1 and
deubiquitination of K63-linked ubiquitin from RIP1 (25).
USP11 mediates downregulation of TNFa-mediated NF-kB
activation through modulation of IkBa stability by its deubiquitination (26). USP14 removes the ubiquitin chain of I-kB,
thereby inducing I-kB degradation and increasing cytokine
release in lung epithelial cells (27). COP9 signalosome (CSN)
regulates assembly and activity of cullin-RING ubiquitin ligases
(CRL), which are involved in the ubiquitination of Ik-a. USP15

4962

Cancer Res; 74(18) September 15, 2014

is identiﬁed as a CSN-associated DUB that reverses the ubiquitinating activity of CSN on IkBa, thus negatively regulating
NF-kB signaling (28).
Several USPs are implicated in the regulation of TGFb
signaling at various levels of the pathway. USP4, USP11, and
USP15 interact with the TGFb receptor I, deubiquitinate, and
stabilize this receptor to engage sustained Smad activation,
resulting in enhancement of TGFb signaling. Inhibiting USP4
and USP11 inhibits TGFb-mediated epithelial–mesenchymal
transition (EMT) and invasion in breast cancer while USP15
inhibition blocks EMT and invasion in glioblastomas (29).
USP4 has also been shown to drive cross-talk between TGFb
and AKT signaling in breast cancer. Inhibiting USP4 suppresses
AKT-mediated breast cancer cell migration. These ﬁndings
underscore the relevance of USP4 in the pathway as AKT
activation has been associated with poor prognosis in breast
cancer (29). USP9X reverses the mono-ubiquitination of Smad4
at Lys 519, a modiﬁcation that prevents its binding to phosphorylated Smad2 and inhibition of TGFb signaling. Thus,
Smad4 deubiquitination by USP9X reinstates TGFb signaling
(12). USP9X can also deubiquitinate E3 ubiquitin ligase
SMURF1, whose substrates include TGFb receptor and coreceptor Smads (30). Recent ﬁndings in our laboratory show an
oncogenic potential of USP9X in established breast cancer cells
and inhibiting USP9X inhibits cell growth in tumorigenic cells
and induces apoptosis in triple-negative breast cancers
(Unpublished Data). Thus, there is accumulating evidence in
favor of therapeutic targeting of USPs like USP4, USP15, and
USP9X in breast cancer.
Inhibitor of differentiation (ID) proteins (ID1-4) regulate
differentiation and maintain stem cell fate through inhibition
of basic–helix–loop–helix transcription factors. ID protein
levels are deregulated during cancer and have been associated
with an aggressive clinical phenotype and poor patient outcomes. The expression levels of ID proteins are tightly regulated through ubiquitination by the APC/Cdh1 E3 ligase complex, which leads to proteasomal degradation and shorter
half-life of ID proteins in the cell (31). Recently, USP1 was
shown to stabilize ID1, ID2, and ID3 protein expression levels in
normal and malignant stem cell populations through its
deubiquitinating activity. USP1 was found to be overexpressed
in a subset of osteosarcomas where it stabilized ID1, ID2, and
ID3, leading to repression of p21 levels and aberrant osteogenic
differentiation (32). USP1 abundance correlated with ID2
protein abundance levels in human osteosarcoma tumors.
Thus, small molecule–mediated targeting of USP1 may provide
an additional modality for treatment of cancer through modulation of ID proteins. Despite the growing interest in USPs and
in acquiring USP inhibitors, their development has been hampered by some of the biochemical properties of the USPs
themselves and mostly unavailable three-dimensional (3D)
structures. To date, only seven USPs have deﬁned 3D structures
(Table 1). USPs can range in size from 350 to 3,500 amino acids.
They comprise a central catalytic domain, which could be 295
to 850 amino acids long and shows an average 22% identity
among USPs and many different additional domains like the
ubiquitin-like domain in USP7 and USP14. Such versatility in
this small family of DUBs could be a boon in the development

USPs in Cancer

of partially selective or speciﬁc inhibitors and will beneﬁt from
unraveling the structural information of more USPs.

Development of Small Molecule Inhibitors
against USPs
USP7 inhibitors: HBX 41, 108, and P5091
Among the earliest reported DUB inhibitors are cyclopentenone prostaglandins that induce apoptosis and also increase the
cellular content of poly-ubiquitinated proteins, suggesting they
are nonselective DUB inhibitors (3). A small molecule discovered in screens for DUB inhibitors, PR-619, is selective for DUBs
over other cysteine proteases, but inhibits all DUBs tested with
moderate potency. More recently, HBX 41,108, which was
originally reported to be a USP7 inhibitor, was conﬁrmed to
be a nonselective DUB inhibitor. HBX 41,108 stabilizes p53 in
HEK293 cells and induces caspase-3 and PARP cleavage in both
p53þ/þ and p53/ HCT-116 cells. The speciﬁcity of HBX 41,108
is limited as it can also inhibit USP5, USP8, UCH-L3, and
caspase-3 with a potency (70–200 nmol/L) greater than its
activity against USP7 (530 nmol/L). However, because of the
critical regulatory functions played by USP7 in the cell there is
tremendous interest in developing USP7-speciﬁc inhibitors (33).
Progenra has identiﬁed the novel P5091 small-molecule USP7speciﬁc inhibitor that can stabilize p53, inhibit cancer cell
proliferation, and is an active antitumor agent in various tumor
models. P5091 induces apoptosis in multiple myeloma cells
resistant to conventional and bortezomib therapies (34). P5091
is well-tolerated in animals, inhibits tumor growth, prolongs
survival, and triggers synergistic anti–multiple myeloma activity
in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents such as
lenalidomide, HDAC inhibitor, or dexamethasone. Hit-to-lead
optimization identiﬁed additional analogs of P5091 (e.g., aqueous soluble derivative P045204) that increases the steady-state
levels of p53 and its transcriptional target p21 in a timedependent manner in HCT-116 cells.
USP14 inhibitors: b-AP15
b-AP15, also known as VLX1500, is a unique class of proteasome inhibitor that inhibits the activity of the 19S regulatory
particle–associated DUBs, UCHL5, a ubiquitin C terminal
hydrolase, and USP14. b-AP15 induces apoptosis in tumor
cells irrespective of their mutant p53 status and BCL2 overexpression and is effective in inhibiting tumor progression in
multiple solid tumor mouse models and dissemination of an in
vivo AML model. The apoptotic effects of b-AP15 are mediated
through the induction of oxidative and endoplasmic reticulum
(ER) stress in response to b-AP15–mediated accumulation of
poly-ubiquitinated proteins (35).

USP1-UAF1 inhibitors: Pimozide, GW7647, and ML323
Pimozide and GW7647 inhibit USP1–UAF1 complex through
noncompetitive binding, which provides for more selectivity
and speciﬁcity toward USP1–UAF1. These inhibitors act in
synergy with cisplatin to inhibit cell proliferation in cisplatinresistant non–small cell lung cancer cells (36). Pimozide also
inhibits leukemic cell growth through degradation of USP1
substrate ID1 (37). ML323 is another highly potent inhibitor of
the USP1–UAF1 complex that provides for excellent selectivity
against DUBs. In non–small cell lung cancer and osteosarcomas, ML323 potentiates cisplatin-induced cytotoxicity (38).
ML323-mediated inhibition of USP1 inhibits deubiquitination
of FANCD2 and PCNA and compromises TLS and FA pathways
(38). Thus, ML323 may provide a means to sensitize cancer
cells to platinum-based therapies.
USP9X inhibitors: WP1130 and its derivatives
In our laboratory, we described and developed the smallmolecule inhibitor WP1130, also known as Degrasyn, which
was derived from a compound with JAK2 kinase–inhibitory
activity. WP1130 rapidly induces accumulation of poly-ubiquitinated proteins, resulting in induction of apoptosis.
WP1130 is a partially selective inhibitor that directly inhibits
the deubiquitinating activity of USP9X, USP5, and USP14, all
of which regulate survival protein stability and proteasome
function. In several studies done in the recent past, USP9X
inhibition by WP1130 promotes apoptosis by reducing MCL1 levels and increased tumor cell sensitivity to chemotherapy
(39). Recently, USP9X inhibition by WP1130 was shown to
inhibit the growth of ERG-positive tumors in vitro and in
mouse xenograft models of prostate cancer (40). Our laboratory has been actively engaged in identifying derivatives
with greater selectivity, activity, and drug-like properties. We
recently identiﬁed and are developing a compound with
improved speciﬁcity toward USP9X and antitumor activity
in mouse models of myeloma, lymphoma, and melanoma
(unpublished data).
Conclusively, there is accumulating experimental evidence
that a large number of USPs could be targeted for anticancer
therapeutics. Early evidence for antitumor efﬁcacy with the
currently available USP inhibitors is more than encouraging
and sets the stage for the development of selective, as well as
partially selective, small-molecule DUB inhibitors.
