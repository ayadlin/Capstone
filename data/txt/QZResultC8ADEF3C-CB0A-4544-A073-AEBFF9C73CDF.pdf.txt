Abstract

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Approximately 75% of breast cancers express estrogen receptor α (ERα) and depend on estrogen
signals for continued growth. Aromatase inhibitors (AIs) prevent estrogen production and inhibit
estrogen receptor signaling, resulting in decreased cancer recurrence and mortality. Advanced
tumors treated with AIs almost always develop resistance to these drugs via the up-regulation of
alternative growth signals. The mechanisms that drive this resistance—especially epigenetic events
that alter gene expression—are however not well understood. Genome-wide DNA methylation and
expression analysis of cell line models of acquired aromatase inhibitor resistance indicated that
prostaglandin E2 receptor 4 (PTGER4) is up-regulated after demethylation in resistant cells.
Knockdown and inhibitor studies demonstrate that PTGER4 is essential for estrogen independent
growth. Our exploratory analysis of downstream signaling indicates that PTGER4 likely promotes
AI resistance via ligand independent activation of the ERα-cofactor CARM1. We believe that we
have discovered a novel epigenetic mechanism for altering cell signaling and acquiring endocrine
therapy resistance. Our findings indicate that PTGER4 is a potential drug target in AI resistant
cancers. Additionally, the epigenetic component of PTGER4 regulation suggests that further study
of PTGER4 may yield valuable insights into how DNA methylation-targeted diagnoses and
treatments can improve AI resistant breast cancer treatment.

Introduction
Estrogen receptor α (ERα) is necessary for normal human breast development due to its
role in processing estrogen growth signals. About 75% of breast tumors express and depend
upon ERα1–3. Endocrine therapies that disrupt estrogen-ERα binding have a long record of
clinical efficacy. Endocrine therapies can be divided into two broad classes: 1) selective
estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) that competitively inhibit estrogen binding to ERα,
and 2) aromatase inhibitors (AIs) that prevent the synthesis of estrogen3. AIs decrease
recurrence and mortality in post-menopausal women when compared to SERMs, such as
tamoxifen4. Despite this increased efficacy, resistance to AI therapy occurs in nearly all of
the advanced or metastatic tumors, often through the activation of ligand-independent ER
signaling5.

Author Manuscript

Genetic analyses of both patient tumors and cell line models have revealed several
mechanisms of acquired AI resistance5. Genomic alterations such as amplifications,
mutations, or translocations can activate ESR1 in low estrogen conditions6,7. Ligandindependent ERα activation can also occur through activation of the PI3K and MAPK
signaling pathways at the cell membrane8. Activating mutations in the PI3K and MAPK
pathways are frequently found in ERα-positive breast cancers9. MAPK signaling required
for estrogen-independent growth can also be activated by upstream factors such as silencing
of the cyclin-dependent kinase CDK1010. The downstream effectors of these pathways are
responsible for phosphorylation of ERα, which activates it in the absence of estrogen11,12.

Author Manuscript

Despite improved understanding of potential genetic mechanisms leading to acquired AI
resistance, potential epigenetic mechanisms of resistance are not well explored. Almost all
cancers exhibit altered DNA methylation, an epigenetic mark that contributes to cancer
development13 and progression14. Epigenetic studies of endocrine therapy resistance have
mostly focused on the direct silencing of ESR1 mediated by either DNA methylation or
histone deacetylation15–22. However, less is known about how epigenetic changes might
contribute to the regulation of transcriptional networks in the development of acquired AI
resistance.

Author Manuscript

In this work, we hypothesized that changes in DNA methylation contribute to acquired
endocrine therapy resistance. Resistance to estrogen withdrawal was modeled in ERαpositive cancer cell lines that have been subjected to long-term estrogen deprivation
(LTED)23. LTED cell line models have facilitated the identification of mechanisms of
acquired endocrine therapy resistance including increased ERα expression7 as well as
increased signaling through PI3K, AKT, and MAPK23–25. They also have been used to show
that PI3K pathway inhibitors induce cell death in ERα-positive cell lines with oncogenic
PI3K mutations, suggesting that targeting the PI3K pathway may improve treatment options
for a subset of women23,24.
Genome-wide methylation and expression analysis of LTED cells identified
hypomethylation correlated with increased expression of the prostaglandin E2 receptor 4
gene (PTGER4) in LTED cells. EP4, the PTGER4 gene product, is a G-protein coupled

receptor that activates adenylyl cyclase (AC) and protein kinase A (PKA) in response to
prostaglandin E226. We find that EP4 activity is necessary for the proliferation of LTED
cells. We also show that EP4 up-regulation likely exerts its proliferative effect through PKAmediated activation of CARM1, which in turn binds to ERα and promotes ligandindependent activation of ER-response genes. The significance of these molecular studies
elucidating how EP4 is required for estrogen-independent growth was further demonstrated
in the identification of PTGER4 up-regulation in AI resistant breast tumor samples. The loss
of methylation and activation of PTGER4 represents a possible mechanism of acquired
endocrine therapy resistance that can be therapeutically targeted.

Results
DNA methylation is altered in a model of acquired resistance to endocrine therapy

Author Manuscript

To understand potential epigenetic causes of acquired resistance to endocrine therapy, we
performed genome-wide methylation and transcriptome analysis in the MCF7 cells
conditioned to grow in the absence of estrogen (MCF7-LTED, long-term estrogen deprived)
(GSE45337, GSE74943). Since MCF7 cells do not express aromatase (as verified by our
RNA-seq data), AI resistance is modeled by estrogen withdrawal. After the removal of
estrogen, most cells die; however, a few survive and eventually proliferate in the absence of
estrogen23.

Author Manuscript

Genome-wide methylation analysis using Methyl-MAPS27 indicated genome-wide
hypomethylation in MCF7-LTED compared to MCF7 cells with 245 644 CpG sites losing
methylation and 28 751 sites gaining methylation. Analysis of these sites indicated that the
majority of these changes occurred in transposable elements (Supplementary Fig. S1a).
Previously, it was shown that hypomethylation induced by 5-azacytidine increased estrogenindependent growth28, which suggests a general mechanism whereby methylation loss in
breast tumors could contribute to estrogen-independent growth and thus endocrine therapy
resistance.
LTED Cells Up-regulate ERα response genes and Potential Resistance Genes

Author Manuscript

RNA-seq analysis indicated 443 up- and 353 down-regulated genes in MCF7-LTED cells
relative to MCF7. We searched the promoters of up- and down-regulated genes for
methylation changes from 500 bp upstream to 1 kb downstream of the transcription start
sites (TSS), since these regions often correlate with gene expression changes29,30. Using
stringent criteria, we identified seven genes with promoter methylation changes that
associated with expression changes. Identified genes included PTGER4 and WISP2
(Supplementary Table 1). We validated correlations in PTGER4 by examining whether
differentially methylated regions correlated with expression across 632 breast tumors and 98
normal breast tissue samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA, Supplementary Fig.
S4). WISP2 showed a marked increase in methylation 3′ of the TSS, which was
accompanied by a dramatic decrease in expression (Supplementary Fig. S3). It was
previously shown that knockdown of WISP2, a WNT-signaling interacting protein,
promoted estrogen-independent growth in MCF7 cells31. WNT-signaling has been
implicated in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and ontology pathway analysis

indicated that genes up-regulated in MCF7-LTED cells were enriched for TGF-beta
dependent induction of EMT. However, visual inspection of MCF7-LTED cells did not
indicate an obvious EMT phenotype and analysis of RNA-seq data showed they have a
standard epithelial expression pattern: high expression of E-cadherin and no expression of
vimentin, SNAIL, TWIST, and Zeb1.

Author Manuscript

Instead, we focused on the PTGER4 gene that encodes the EP4 receptor. We chose EP4
because it showed the largest expression increase of the candidates, showed a strong and
clear change in methylation, and EP4 presents a potential druggable target. EP4 is a Gprotein coupled receptor that activates AC and PKA in response to prostaglandin E226. The
PTGER4 gene has a CpG island associated with its promoter that lost methylation in the
transition from MCF7 to MCF7-LTED (Fig. 1a). Methylation changes were validated using
Methyl-Screen (Supplementary Fig. S2a)32. This loss of methylation is accompanied with a
greater than 20-fold gain in PTGER4 expression as indicated by RNA-seq (Fig. 1a, MCF7
cpm = 1.9, 8.9; MCF7-LTED cpm = 226.4, 175.5) and confirmed by RT-qPCR
(Supplementary Fig. S2b). Furthermore, MCF7 cells treated with 5-azacytidine expressed
higher levels of PTGER433 (Supplementary Fig. 8), consistent with the hypothesis that DNA
hypomethylation directly regulates expression. Increased mRNA levels in MCF7-LTED cells
were accompanied with increases in EP4 protein expression as observed by
immunofluorescence (Fig. 1b). Increased EP4 expression in MCF7 LTED cells was also
accompanied by increased cAMP in response to the EP4 agonist L-902,688 (Fig. 3b).
EP4 inactivation decreases estrogen-independent cell growth in MCF7-LTED cells

Author Manuscript

We sought to determine whether EP4 knockdown would affect the ability of MCF7-LTED
cells to grow without estrogen. EP4 was knocked down using two EP4-targeted siRNAs in
both MCF7 and MCF7-LTED cells. Visual inspection indicated siEP4s drastically reduced
cell proliferation in comparison to siRNA controls. We quantified the attenuated growth
using reduction in alamarBlue to measure relative cellular proliferation seven days after
transfection (Fig. 2a). We verified knockdown at the mRNA level by RT-qPCR (Fig. 2b).
Since appropriate antibodies could not be found for Western blot analysis, we validated a
decrease in EP4 protein by immunofluorescence (Fig. 2d) and by measurement of the
secondary messenger cAMP, which is produced as a result of EP4 activity (Fig. 2c). MCF7LTED cells treated with siRNAs targeting EP4 mRNA showed a 61% and 59% average
reduction in cell proliferation relative to control siRNAs (p < 10−7 for each siRNA, Fig. 2a).
These siRNAs showed no effect in MCF7 cells, which have negligible levels of EP4
expression at the mRNA and protein levels and thus provide a control for off-target effects.

Author Manuscript

We further validated the importance of EP4 for estrogen-independent growth in MCF7LTED cells using two EP4-specific antagonists that do not inhibit other prostaglandin
receptors: GW627368X and ONO-AE3-208. We observed an average 32% reduction in
cellular proliferation for GW627368X-treated and an average 38% reduction for ONOAE3-208-treated MCF7-LTED cells relative to vehicle alone (p < 10−7 for each antagonist,
Fig. 2e). Again, MCF7 cells, which have negligible EP4 expression, showed no significant
proliferation reduction when treated with antagonists.

Functional analysis of EP4 signaling in MCF7-LTED cells

Author Manuscript

EP4 activates two pro-growth signaling pathways: PI3K and PKA, both of which could
promote endocrine therapy resistance. MCF7-LTED cells show increased Akt and PI3K
activity, and short-term estrogen deprived (STED) MCF7 cells are sensitive to the BGT226
and BKM120 PI3K inhibitors23. Additionally, EP4 activation can result in phosphorylation
and activation of Akt26. However, our MCF7-LTED cells are resistant to the effects of the
BGT226 and BKM120 PI3K inhibitors23. Analysis of Akt and PI3K phosphorylation also
showed no changes after treatment of MCF7-LTED cells with EP4 antagonists (Fig. 3a). In
addition, we did not find changes in mTOR or MAPK signaling. This suggests that other
pathways are likely activated by EP4 in our MCF7-LTED model.

Author Manuscript

We next hypothesized that PTGER4 might contribute to endocrine therapy resistance via
AC. EP4 activates AC in addition to Akt, and AC activity can induce ERα phosphorylation.
Once activated AC produces cAMP as its secondary messenger, and cAMP promotes
proliferation through downstream effectors such as PKA26. We observed that both the
concentration of cAMP in LTED cells and cell proliferation decreased after EP4 reduction
by siRNA knockdown (Fig. 2a,c). This suggested that EP4 promotes proliferation in LTED
cells via AC and cAMP. To confirm this, we applied the EP4 specific agonist L-902,688 to
MCF7-LTED cells and observed a dramatic increase in cAMP which was inhibited by EP4
with antagonists (Fig. 3b).

Author Manuscript

A recent report showed that cAMP activates CARM1 via phosphorylation by PKA and
drives ligand-independent ER transcriptional activity to promote resistance to tamoxifen34.
CARM1 is an estrogen-dependent ER co-activator and phosphorylated CARM1 binds
directly to the ERα hormone binding domain34. We thus tested whether a similar
mechanism caused ligand independent ER signaling in MCF7-LTED cells. CARM1 protein
levels remained unchanged in MCF7-LTED and parental cells in the absence of estrogen
even after treatment with EP4 antagonist (Fig. 3c). We found however that CARM1 acted as
a PKA substrate in MCF7-LTED cells in the absence of estrogen and this interaction went
away after treatment with EP4 antagonist. We further found that ERα showed a strong
interaction between CARM1 and ERα in MCF7-LTED cells based on immunoprecipitation
of CARM1 followed by immunoblotting with an ERα-specific antibody (Fig. 3c). Treatment
with EP4 antagonist removed this interaction, suggesting that the CARM1-ERα interaction
is dependent on EP4 signaling. As has been reported previously34, in estrogen deprived
conditions MCF7 cells showed no activation of CARM1 or association with ERα.

Author Manuscript

We next used chromatin-immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-qPCR to interrogate the relationship
between EP4 and ligand independent binding of ERα in MCF7-LTED cells at two ERα
binding sites in the pS2 and PGR promoters. MCF7-LTED cells were treated with agonist or
vehicle and subjected to ChIP-qPCR with antibodies to CARM1 or ERα at the pS2
promoter, the PGR promoter, and a negative control gene desert region on chr8q24 (Fig.
3d,e). Both CARM1 and ERα were found to have increased binding upon treatment with
EP4-specific agonist relative to cells treated with vehicle. No such gain was observed in the
gene desert region. This implies that EP4 signaling can promote ligand-independent ER
activity through CARM1. Further, knockdown of CARM1 reduced growth in MCF7-LTED
cells (Fig. 3f,g).

ER signaling in MCF7-LTED cells

Author Manuscript

To understand whether ligand-independent ER signaling is active in MCF7-LTED cells, we
used RNA-seq to compare gene expression in MCF7-LTED cells relative to MCF7 cells that
recovered with the addition of estradiol after 1 day of estrogen deprivation. Using MCF7
cells treated with estradiol, we defined a signature of ER signaling based on genes upregulated twofold or more. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA)35 shows that the majority
of ER responsive genes are also up-regulated in MCF7-LTED (p < 10−7, Supplementary Fig.
S6). This is consistent with the finding that MCF7-LTED cells are responsive to the ERantagonist fulvestrant23 and indicates that ligand-independent ER-signaling is active in
MCF7-LTED cells at a genomic level.
EP4 mRNA expression increased in ER+ breast cancer in the neoadjuvant setting

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

To assess the potential clinical relevance of our findings, we tested the hypothesis that EP4
expression increases are associated with initial sensitivity to AI endocrine therapies.
Expression profiling was performed for 104 patients before and after neoadjuvant AI
therapy. 74 tumors were ‘aromatase-inhibitor-resistant’ and 30 were ‘aromatase-inhibitorsensitive’ based on the presence of the proliferation marker Ki67 after treatment (see details
in methods). Ki67 is a well-established indicator of clinical outcome in the neoadjuvant
setting36. We observed that EP4 expression was higher in patients that demonstrated
resistance to AI-therapy versus patients that responded to AI-therapy (Fig. 4a), which is
consistent with EP4 expression playing a role in AI resistance. Interestingly, EP4 expression
also significantly increased during neoadjuvant therapy in both responder and non-responder
tumor samples. This agrees with our observation that EP4 is up-regulated immediately after
estrogen-deprivation in MCF7 cells (Supplementary Fig. S7). Data from two smaller studies
examining mRNA changes during neoadjuvant therapy verify this finding37,38 (Fig. 4b,c;
Supplementary Fig. S5). This suggests that in addition to promoting resistance to AIs, EP4
activation may be a response to the loss of ER signaling in ER+ tumors.

Discussion
In this study we examined the potential for DNA methylation to facilitate acquired endocrine
therapy resistance via EP4 signaling. EP4 signaling also contributes to the proliferation of
several cancer types including colon, lung, prostate, ovarian and breast26. Antagonists of
EP4 have been shown to inhibit metastasis in hormone-resistant murine mammary tumor
cells39. Further, the contribution of EP4 to endocrine therapy resistance via cell signaling is
consistent with its role in the development of castration-resistant prostate cancer via PKA
and cAMP40.

Author Manuscript

While our results focus on epigenetic regulation of the PTGER4 promoter as a means to
activate ER, mutations are unlikely to play a major role in its activation. According to the
COSMIC database, EP4 mutations are exceedingly rare in breast cancer, occurring in 0.33%
of patients and copy number gains in 1.5%41. Sanger sequencing of PTGER4 in both MCF7
and MC7-LTED cells failed to uncover any mutations that could contribute to the increased
activation of EP4. However, analysis of TCGA data indicates that PTGER4 methylation
appears to accompany gene silencing in many breast tumors (Supplementary Fig. S4).

Interestingly, PTGER4 is unmethylated and expressed in normal breast tissue. MCF7 cells
treated with demethylating agents increase PTGER4 mRNA levels, consistent with DNA
methylation playing a direct role in its transcriptional regulation33 (Supplementary Fig. S8).
This supports a mechanism whereby an upstream epigenetic change in the EP4 promoter
regulates PTGER4 expression. Namely an increase in DNA methylation that silences
PTGER4 as the tumor forms followed by a decrease in methylation that reactivates the gene
to promote resistance to estrogen withdrawal in long-term estrogen deprived cells (Fig. 1).

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Our exploratory analyses are consistent with a model whereby increased EP4 levels induce
increased cAMP production, which in turn drives ligand-independent activation of ER
through the PKA-mediated activation of the co-activator CARM1. Prior work has also
indicated that PKA can activate ERα by direct phosphorylation of serines 236 (S236) and
305 (S305). When S236 is phosphorylated, ERα dimerization and DNA binding is still
dependent on ligand42 and thereby S236 phosphorylation is unlikely to activate ERα in
MCF7-LTED cells. Studies in HeLa cells using a phosphomimetic S305E ERα suggested
that S305 phosphorylation was sufficient to induce ligand-independent ERα binding to
transcriptional targets in the absence of ERα dimerization43. However, other studies have
instead suggested that S305 phosphorylated ERα is insufficient for ERα activation and that
cofactors such as CARM134 in MCF7 cells and CREB44 in CHO were required for ERα
binding to DNA and activation of response elements. Further, there may be additional
factors that collaborate to promote ER activity, such as the activation of cholesterol
biosynthesis which was recently shown to activate ligand-independent ER activity45. While
we cannot rule out the direct activation of ERα by PKA nor the activation of additional
cofactors, our observations suggest that in estrogen deprived conditions EP4 promotes
ligand-independent activation of ERα through the PKA-mediated activation of the coactivator CARM1.

Author Manuscript

In addition to up-regulation of EP4, another potential mechanism of ligand-independent ER
activation is through genetic alterations of the ESR1 locus. While any individual event is
quite rare, as a whole these alterations are becoming an important theme in resistance.
Metastatic tumors gain activating ESR1 ligand binding domain mutations, especially after
endocrine therapy6,46–49. Translocations of the ESR1 locus can fuse with coding sequence or
constitutive promoters that activate ESR1 in the absence of estrogen6. ESR1 amplification
has also been noted in both MCF7-LTED cells7 and a xenograft line from a patient tumor
resistant to AIs6. Further, remodeling of DNA methylation at ER responsive binding
elements is associated with endocrine therapy resistance50. Rather than contradict our
findings, however, this indicates that MCF7-LTED cells remain dependent on ER signaling.
Indeed, MCF7-LTED cells are sensitive to fulvestrant, an ER antagonist that accelerates
proteasomal degradation of ER, and thereby show continued ER dependence23.
Additionally, GSEA of RNA-seq data from MCF7-LTED cells shows that MCF7-LTED
cells have increased ER target gene expression. However, PTGER4 overexpression is not the
only mechanism that supports ligand-independent ER activity.
Altogether, these data suggest that increased EP4 expression can promote the development
of resistance to AI therapy. Expression increases in PTGER4 were associated with decreases
in DNA methylation, which is consistent with the idea that DNA methylation has a

regulatory role in PTGER4 expression. Furthermore, our data indicate that EP4 activation is
necessary for estrogen-independent growth. While we cannot completely rule out activation
of alternative signaling pathways, our results support a mechanism by which EP4 acts
through PKA and the co-activator CARM1 to drive ligand-independent ERα activation. EP4
signaling presents a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of AI resistant breast
cancer.

Cells were grown in 10 cm dishes to 85% confluence. The cells were starved by exchanging
growth media for reduced-serum media containing 0.5% charcoal stripped FBS, for 18 hours
before activation of EP4 with 10nM L902,688 EP4 agonist (Cayman Chemical) for 2 hours.
An ethanol-treated sample served as a vehicle control. Afterward, cross-linking was initiated
by drop-wise addition of 37% formaldehyde to a final concentration of 1% at room
temperature. Cross-linking ran for 10 minutes and was quenched for 5 minutes at room
temperature by adding 0.5ml of 2.5M glycine. Quenched cells were washed twice with 10ml
ice-cold PBS, removed from the plate by scraping in ice-cold DPBS (Gibco) with protease
inhibitors, and pelleted. Cell pellets were resuspended in 350 ul ChIP lysis buffer (1% SDS,
10 mM EDTA, 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0) with protease inhibitors. Lysed cells were sonicated
and 100 ug of protein were brought to a final volume of 50ul lysis buffer with protease

10 nM L-902,688 in 10 mL of RPMI + 0.5 mM IBMX and harvested after 0, 5, 15, or 30
minutes. After washing with ice-cold PBS, cells were lysed with 1 mL of RIPA buffer (1 M
tris pH 8.0, 5 M NaCl, 1% NP-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, and 2 mM EDTA
with freshly added PMSF to 1 mM final and 1X Halt protease and phosphatase inhibitor
cocktail [ThermoFisher Scientific]). Cells were scraped loose, the cell lysate was transferred
to a microcentrifuge tube, and the tube was put on a rotator for 30 minutes at 4°C. The
supernatant was isolated by centrifugation at 12,000×g for 20 minutes at 4°C.

Immunoprecipitation was performed with a mouse anti-CARM1 (Cell Signaling Technology
#12495) and precipitated overnight at 4°C. Precipitated proteins were collected with
Dynabeads Protein G magnetic beads. 25 uL of beads were washed with 500 uL of RIPA
buffer before adding the immunoprecipitated proteins. This was then incubated at 4 °C for 3
hours. The protein-bound beads were then washed three times with 0.5 mL RIPA with 10
mM NaF and 1 mM sodium pyrophosphate and resuspended in 0.5 mL of wash buffer. The
protein was eluted in 40 uL of 2x NuPAGE LDS sample buffer at 90°C for 10 minutes. Final
analysis of immunoprecipitated proteins occurred by Western blot on 4–12% gradient PAGE
gels (Life Tech.). ERα was identified using a rabbit polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz
Biotech sc-7207) to minimize signal from the mouse anti-CARM1 IgG used for
immunoprecipitation. The blot was stripped using Restore™ Western Blot Stripping Buffer
(ThermoFisher), and reblotted with rabbit anti-CARM1 antibody (Cell Signaling
Technologies #3379). Alexa Fluor® 680 or Alexa Fluor® 790 labeled secondary antibodies
were from Jackson ImmunoResearch. Blots were imaged using the Odyssey® Fc (LI-COR
Biosciences).
Expression Analysis of ER+ breast cancer in neoadjuvant setting
Expression analysis was performed for patients enrolled in the POL54 (NCT00084396) and
ACOSOG (American College of Surgeons Oncology Group) Z103155 (NCT00265759)
trials. Informed consent was obtained from all patients enrolled and ethics committee
approval was obtained at all participating sites. Postmenopausal women with ER+ Stage
II/III breast cancer were treated with letrozole, anastrozole, or exemestane for 16–18 weeks.

Biopsies were performed before and after treatment. Patients were labeled as resistant if
10% or more of malignant cells stained positive for the proliferative marker Ki67 at 16
weeks. Expression analysis was performed using Agilent Human Gene Expression 4×44K
v2 Microarray. P-values for PTGER4 expression were computed using two-sided MannWhitney U. Bartlett’s test of the homogeneity of variances was insignificant (alpha = 0.05)
for all comparisons under the null-hypothesis of equal variances.
