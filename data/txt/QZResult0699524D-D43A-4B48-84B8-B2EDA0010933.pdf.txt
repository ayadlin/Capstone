ABSTRACT
The most abundant populations of non-neoplastic cells in the glioblastoma (GBM)
microenvironment are resident microglia, macrophages and infiltrating monocytes
from the blood circulation. The mechanisms by which monocytes infiltrate into
GBM, their fate following infiltration, and their role in GBM growth are not known.
Here we tested the hypothesis that loss of the fractalkine receptor CX3CR1 in
microglia and monocytes would affect gliomagenesis. Deletion of Cx3cr1 from the
microenvironment resulted in increased tumor incidence and shorter survival times
in glioma-bearing mice. Loss of Cx3cr1 did not affect accumulation of microglia/
macrophages in peri-tumoral areas, but instead indirectly promoted the trafficking
of CD11b+CD45hiCX3CR1lowLy-6ChiLy-6G-F4/80-/low circulating inflammatory monocytes
into the CNS, resulting in their increased accumulation in the perivascular area. Cx3cr1deficient microglia/macrophages and monocytes demonstrated upregulation of IL1β
expression that was inversely proportional to Cx3cr1 gene dosage. The Proneural
subgroup of the TCGA GBM patient dataset with high IL1β expression showed shorter
survival compared to patients with low IL1β. IL1β promoted tumor growth and
increased the cancer stem cell phenotype in murine and human Proneural glioma
stem cells (GSCs). IL1β activated the p38 MAPK signaling pathway and expression of
monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP-1/CCL2) by tumor cells. Loss of Cx3cr1 in
microglia in a monocyte-free environment had no impact on tumor growth and did not
alter microglial migration. These data suggest that enhancing signaling to CX3CR1 or
inhibiting IL1β signaling in intra-tumoral macrophages can be considered as potential
strategies to decrease the tumor-promoting effects of monocytes in Proneural GBM.

INTRODUCTION

interact with GSCs in the PVA may help to identify new
therapeutic targets in the glioma microenvironment that
can be combined with standard glioma therapies.
To study the role of microglia and monocytes/
macrophages in GBM and their potential interactions
with GSCs, we perturbed macrophage activation in
tumors by genetically inactivating the CX3CR1/CX3CL1
signaling pathway. CX3CR1 is expressed by monocytes
in the circulation and exclusively by microglia in the
central nervous system (CNS) [17]. The ligand CX3CL1
is expressed by neurons and is the most abundantly
expressed chemokine in the CNS. Accordingly, CX3CR1
regulates communications between neurons and microglia.
The effects of CX3CR1 signaling on disease progression
vary depending on the type of the CNS disease [18-21].
To study the functional role of CX3CR1/CX3CL1
signaling in GBM, we used a genetically engineered
mouse model (GEMM) of adult PDGFB-driven gliomas,
which is based on RCAS/Tv-a, a somatic cell-specific
gene transfer system [22]. In terms of both gross pathology
[23] and molecular profile, these tumors strongly
resemble the human Proneural GBM subtype, which
represents 30% of human GBM [3, 4]. As these mice
are immunocompetent, this model is a suitable system
to study interactions between immune and glioma cells.
Here, we show that loss of CX3CR1/CX3CL1 signaling
in tumor-associated microglia and monocytes results in
an increased incidence of GBM formation with shorter
tumor latency in glioma-bearing mice. While having no
effect on microglial migration in peri-tumoral regions,
loss of Cx3cr1 did increase Ly-6Chi “inflammatory”
monocyte infiltration from the blood circulation into
GBM, where they preferentially localized in perivascular
areas. Loss of Cx3cr1 results in a dose-dependent increase
in IL1β expression in microglia and macrophages. This
overexpression of IL1β in turn promotes glioma growth,
induces activation of the p38 MAPK pathway, increases
the GSC phenotype, and upregulates CCL2 expression,
which correlates with greater monocyte infiltration. These
data suggest that CX3CL1/CX3CR1 signaling, which is
the most active chemokine-signaling system in the healthy
CNS and is not expressed by GBM cells, may have
potential as a therapeutic strategy to decrease monocyte
infiltration into GBM. Our findings also imply that IL1β
may be a therapeutic target for human Proneural GBM
patients.

The glioma subtype known as glioblastoma (GBM)
is the most aggressive and most common primary brain
tumor. Despite research advances, over 95% of patients
succumb to their disease, resulting in a median survival
time of only 14.6 months [1]. These dismal survival
statistics highlight the urgent need for new approaches to
GBM therapy. Analysis through The Cancer Genome Atlas
(TCGA) initiative identified several subclasses of GBM,
termed Proneural, Neural, Classical, and Mesenchymal,
which are strongly associated with genomic abnormalities
in platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR),
isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 or 2 (IDH 1 or 2), epidermal
growth factor receptor (EGFR), and neurofibromin
1 (NF1), respectively [2, 3]. Although initial studies
showed that patients with a Proneural subtype had
markedly better survival compared to the other subtypes
[4], this phenomenon was conferred when glioma-CpG
island methylator phenotype G-CIMP-positive tumors
were excluded [5]. Differences among the subtypes
are highlighted by the fact that they show differential
responses to glioma cell-targeted standard therapies
of various intensities, with better results achieved by
more intense therapeutic regimes in all subtypes except
Proneural [3].
Histological analysis of GBM revealed a
heterogeneous cellular composition of neoplastic glioma
cells and non-neoplastic cells, which form a tumor
microenvironment composed of brain-resident microglia,
infiltrating monocytes/macrophages, reactive astrocytes,
endothelial cells, pericytes, neural stem/progenitor cells,
and other immune cell infiltrates [6, 7]. Microglia and
monocytes/macrophages constitute up to 30% of tumor
mass in both human and murine GBM [7]. It has been
demonstrated that microglia promote tumor growth [8], but
to what extent tumor promotion is attributable to microglia
versus monocytes/macrophages still remains unclear. It is
also unclear to what extent GBM macrophages are derived
from infiltrating cells from the blood circulation and what
the ratio between microglia and monocyte/macrophages
is. The importance of a nuanced understanding of the
roles of microglia and monocyte/macrophages in GBM is
highlighted by studies showing that these two cell types
have dramatically different responses to injury [9, 10].
In addition to the invasive growth that prevents a
complete surgical resection, the resistance of GBM to
therapy is partially explained by two hallmark features of
glioma stem cells (GSCs): radio-resistance and chemoresistance. Experimentally, these cells can be enriched
based on expression of a variety of surface markers [11,
12] or their ability to exclude Hoechst dye or DyeCycle
violet (DCV) in a side population assay (SP) [13, 14].
GSCs reside in the perivascular area (PVA) in both human
and murine gliomas [15, 16.] Thus, understanding the ways
that microglia and infiltrating monocytes/macrophages

and migration, we decided to study the role of CX3CR1 in
gliomagenesis. For these studies, we used mice in which
the Cx3cr1 gene was inactivated following germline
insertion of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene, such
that heterozygous mice Cx3cr1GFP/+ expressed the GFP
reporter in cells that retained receptor function, whereas
homozygous Cx3cr1GFP/GFP cells were labeled with GFP
but lacked Cx3cr1expression (i.e. Cx3cr1GFP/GFP equals
Cx3cr1-/-) [24]. We transplanted freshly dissociated cells
from GBM generated in Gli-luciferase;Nestin-Tv-a;Ink4Arf-/-;pten fl/fl (referred to as NiG mice) into B6 (strain
control or Cx3cr1+/+), Cx3cr1GFP/+ and Cx3cr1GFP/GFP

Cx3cr1 deficiency results in increased tumor
incidence and shorter survival times in GBMbearing mice
Microglia and monocyte infiltration and function
are partially regulated by chemokines, which act on
chemokine receptors such as CX3CR1. As CX3CR1
signaling has been implicated in both microglial activation

Figure 1: Homozygous deletion of Cx3Cr1 in the tumor microenvironment increases the percentage of GBM formation
and shortens tumor latency. This leads to an increase in the total number of macrophages in tumors, which mainly accumulate in

perivascular regions of GBM. A) Kaplan-Meier survival curves show that homozygous loss of Cx3cr1 results in shortened survival of
tumor-bearing mice compared to heterozygous loss of Cx3cr1 or B6 mice (Cx3cr1GFP/GFP vs. Cx3cr1GFP/+ MC p=0.0520, GBW *P < 0.05;
Cx3cr1GFP/GFP vs. B6 MC *P < 0.05, GBW **P<0.01; Log-rank (Mantel-Cox-MC) tests and Gehan-Breslow-Wilcoxon tests (GBW) were
used). The tumor incidence (%) and median survival of tumor-bearing mice in Cx3cr1 homozygous, heterozygous knock-in and B6 mice
are incorporated in the curves (n=13, 10, 23 for B6, Cx3cr1GFP/+ and Cx3cr1GFP/GFP, correspondingly). B) Representative BLI images of
tumor-bearing mice and quantification of BLI in Cx3cr1 homozygous, heterozygous knock-in and B6 mice at the end-point of survival
curves showing no statistically significant differences in tumor size based on Cx3Cr1 status. C) Brain tumor sections from B6, Cx3cr1GFP/+
and Cx3cr1GFP/GFP mice with GFP (green), anti-Iba1 (red), and anti-CD31 (gray) and counterstained with DAPI (blue). Representative
images demonstrate that Cx3cr1GFP/GFP animals exhibit a higher number of Iba1-positive cells, which are mainly localized in perivascular
areas of tumors. D) The number of Iba1-positive cells and perivascular areas were quantified in tumors from the three genotypes (n=5
animals per each genotype; left and right graph, correspondingly). Loss of two copies of Cx3cr1 resulted in a statistically significant
increase in the number of Iba1-positive cells and increased PVN area compared to the loss of one copy or wild-type (*p < 0.05), E) which
reside in perivascular areas of GBM (one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparisons test, *p < 0.05 and **p < 0.01, respectively).

mice. Homozygous loss of Cx3cr1 resulted in a significant
decrease in tumor latency and in increased tumor incidence
(Fig. 1A). A trend toward increased tumor incidence was
also observed in heterozygous GBM-bearing mice (Fig.
1A). The survival curve summarizes the tumor incidence
and median survival times of tumor-bearing mice from
the three different genotypes. Next we evaluated whether
the shorter survival times of tumor-bearing mice in the
Cx3cr1-deficient background might result from tumor
location or size at the end-point of survival. All tumorbearing mice independent of background demonstrated
similar neurological signs including lethargy, grooming,
and weight loss of 15% or more, which were used as
criteria to determine the end-point. As transplanted tumor
cells also had a Gli-luciferase reporter, we visualized
tumors by BLI during tumor growth (data not shown) and
at the end-point of survival in vivo and ex vivo. The size
of tumors generated in B6, Cx3cr1GFP/+ and Cx3cr1GFP/
GFP
, as determined by BLI, was not significantly different
between groups (Fig. 1B). Ex vivo BLI imaging of tumorcontaining whole brains also showed no significant
differences in tumor location in the three genotypes (data
not shown).

also positive for Iba1 (data not shown, Fig. 1C). Based
on these data, we then used Iba1 to quantify the density of
macrophages in tumors generated in the three genotypes.
Homozygous loss of Cx3cr1 resulted in a statistically
significant increase in the density of macrophages
in tumors (Fig. 1C and 1D). Iba1/CX3CR1 doublepositive cells were mainly located in the PVA (Fig. 1C).
Quantification of PVA, based on area occupied by Iba1positive cells, in tumors generated in the three genotypes
demonstrated statistically significant increases in the sizes
of PVA due to increased area occupied by macrophages in
GBM in Cx3cr1-deficient hosts (Fig. 1E). There were no
genotype-dependent differences in either total vessel area
or average vessel size in either tumors or the surrounding
brain tissue (Fig S2A and S2B). These data suggest that
the increases in PVA and the number of macrophages
observed in tumors from Cx3cr1GFP/GFP mice are not due
to increased angiogenesis.

CX3CL1 expression is decreased in both murine
and human GBM tissue

Increased density of macrophages in stromal
Cx3cr1-deficient tumors can be caused by either local
expansion of microglia or by increased infiltration
of monocytes from the blood circulation, possibly
accompanied by expansion of this population. To test
for increased monocyte density, we analyzed CD11b
and CD45 expression in similar-sized tumors at the endpoint of survival in each of the three genotypes using
flow cytometry. Previously, characterization of tumorassociated microglia and macrophages by flow cytometry
identified that, although both resident microglia and
blood macrophages have high CD11b expression, they
show differential expression levels for the CD45 surface
antigen, with microglia being low and blood macrophages
being high [25, 26]. After setting the total CD45+CD11b+
population to 100%, we then examined differences in
the percentages of CD45hi (hematogenous) cells versus
CD45low cells (microglia) (Fig. 2A). While there were
no significant differences observed in the percentage of
CD45hi cells in CX3CR1-negative tumors (Fig. 2B), we
found a significant enrichment of CD11b+ CD45hi Ly-6Chi
Ly-6G- F4/80-/low immature or inflammatory monocytes in
tumors generated in Cx3cr1-deficient mice as compared to
tumors in heterozygous Cx3cr1 or wild-type (WT) mice
(Fig. 2C). This population was CX3CR1low as previously
reported [31]. Ly-6G staining confirmed the monocytic
lineage of these cells and also showed that there were no
genotype-dependent differences in neutrophil infiltration
(Fig. 2D). Next, we evaluated whether the phenomenon
of increased monocyte infiltration is also observed in
the brains of naïve Cx3cr1-deficient mice compared
to heterozygous Cx3cr1 or WT mice. There were no

Cx3cr1 deficiency results in a significant increase

in Ly-6Chi “inflammatory” monocyte infiltration
into GBM

CX3CL1 was abundantly expressed in naïve brains
of NiG mice, while mRNA expression was significantly
less in murine GBM samples and freshly sorted GBM
cells (Fig. S1A). Assessment of REMBRANDT data also
revealed that CX3CL1 mean expression intensity was
decreased in human GBM samples compared to nontumor control samples (Fig. S1D). CX3CL1 protein was
abundantly expressed in naïve brain but was undetectable
in GBM tissue, freshly sorted or cultured GBM cells (Fig.
S1B and S1C). These data suggest that tumor cells do not
express detectable levels of CX3CL1 protein and that
mRNA levels are low compared to the naïve brain, which
could be partially attributable to the known phenomenon
of significantly decreased numbers of neurons in GBM
tissue.

In gliomas, Cx3cr1 deficiency increases density of
microglia/macrophages, which are preferentially
localized in perivascular areas
CX3CR1 signaling is implicated in the survival
of microglia and monocytes/macrophages. We thus
determined the effect of CX3CR1 deficiency on
macrophage density in GBM. Quantification of CX3CR1
(based on GFP-expression) and ionized calcium-binding
adapter molecule 1 (Iba1) double-positive cells from
tumors generated in Cx3cr1GFP/+ and Cx3cr1GFP/GFP mice
revealed that over 95% of CX3CR-positive cells were

significant differences in the percentages of CD45hi or
infiltrating monocytes in Cx3cr1-deficient mice compared
to heterozygous Cx3cr1 or WT mice (Fig. S3), suggesting
that this is GBM-specific. Taken together, these data
in Figures 1 and 2 show increased GBM infiltration by
inflammatory monocytes and a higher density of tumorassociated macrophages in mice lacking CX3CR1.
To test whether the local proliferation of monocytes,
macrophages and microglia contributes to their increased
accumulation in PVA, we performed a BrdU incorporation
experiment with two pulses every 6 hours (at 10 mg/
kg body weight) for 12 hours before sacrificing tumorbearing animals of the three genotypes and quantifying
Iba1+BrdU+ cell numbers. We did observe small but
significant differences in the proliferation rates of Iba1positive cells between tumors generated in WT (B6) and
Cx3cr1-deficient mice (Cx3cr1GFP/GFP mice) (Fig. 3A
and 3B). Next we examined whether decreased levels

of apoptosis of Iba1+ cells in PVA could contribute
to their increased numbers in tumors generated in
Cx3cr1-deficient mice. We stained tumors from the
three genotypes for cleaved-caspase-3 and Iba1. We did
not observe significant differences in cleaved-caspase3+BrdU+ cell numbers in any of the three genotypes (Fig.
3C and 3D). Next we analyzed whether the amount of
Ly-6Chi monocytes in the blood changes over the course
of disease progression in host Cx3cr1-deficient tumorbearing mice, potentially contributing to their increased
density in tumors. The number of CD11bv Ly-6ChiLy6G- inflammatory monocytes in the blood was analyzed
before mice were subjected to stereotactic surgeries for
tumor cell transplantation and then blood collection was
repeated 20 days post-surgery, when mice did not yet show
signs of tumors. The density of inflammatory monocytes,
however, was significantly decreased in Cx3cr1-deficient
mice with tumors (Fig. 3E), a decrease which might be

macrophages) and CD11+CD45lo/int (resident brain microglia). Total population of CD11b+CD45+ is considered as 100%, and they are
further gated on Ly-6C and F40/80 positivity for tumors from the three genotypes (upper panel). The CD45+CD11b+ population is further
gated for Ly-6C and Ly-6G positivity to distinguish monocytes from neutrophils and further gated for GFP (CX3CR1), which shows that
while inflammatory monocytes are positive for GFP, neutrophils are negative. B) Dot plots represent the percentage of CD45hi population
in the total CD11b+CD45+ population of tumors from the three genotypes. Although there is a trend towards an increase in CD45hi in tumors
from Cx3cr1GFP/GFP mice, it does not reach statistical significance (n=4, 8 and 5 individual tumors for B6, Cx3cr1GFP+ and Cx3cr1GFP/GFP,
respectively). Tumor sizes were chosen close to the end-point of survival to ensure similar sizes in the three different genotypes. C) Dot
plots represent the percentage of Ly-6Chi monocytes in the total CD11b+CD45+ population in tumors from the three different genotypes

there was a statistically significant increase in the percentage of Ly-6Chi monocytes in tumors from Cx3cr1GFP/GFP animals compared to B6
or Cx3cr1GFP+ animals (*p < 0.05 and **p < 0.01, correspondingly). D) Dot plots represent the percentage of Ly-6G+ neutrophils in tumors
from the three different genotypes showing that loss of one or both copies of Cx3cr1 had no impact on neutrophil infiltration into GBM.

caused by increased infiltration into the CNS. In endpoint of survival experiments, all mice showed decreases
in inflammatory monocytes as compared to their original
blood levels (data not shown) and there were no significant
differences between groups (Fig. 3F). These data suggest
that the increased density of inflammatory monocytes in
Cx3Cr1-deficient mice is due to their increased infiltration

into the CNS from the blood circulation during disease
progression.

cells in the three genotypes. E) Dot plots representing the number of CD11b+Ly-6Chi Ly-6G- inflammatory monocytes were analyzed from

the transplant, see E. A paired t-test was used in Figure 6E and a one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparisons test was performed

Loss of Cx3cr1 leads to a dose-dependent increase
in IL1β expression by microglia/macrophages

IL1β increases glioma cell growth/viability and
enhances the glioma stem cell phenotype

To gain insight into the tumor-promoting effects of
CX3CR1-deficient cells in the tumor microenvironment,
the expression levels of TNF-α, iNOS, IL6 and IL1β,
which each have altered expression due to loss of
CX3CR1 in different CNS diseases [18, 20], were
examined by quantitative RT-PCR. CD11b+CD45+Ly-6Gand CD11b+CD45+Ly-6G-GFP+ cells were sorted from
tumors generated in B6, Cx3cr1GFP/+ and Cx3cr1GFP/GFP
mice, correspondingly; RNA was isolated and analyzed
for TNF-α, iNOS, IL6, and IL1β expression. While no
significant changes were observed between the three
genotypes for TNF-α, iNOS, or IL6 by qPCR (Fig. 4A),
we confirmed a significant dose-dependent increase (when
one or both copies of the Cx3cr1 gene were removed)
in IL1β expression. We excluded the possibility of
constitutive differences in IL1β expression in naïve brains
from the three different genotypes (Fig. 4B). We analyzed
the TCGA data set [2] for relative IL1β mRNA expression
in human GBM subgroups (Fig. 4C), as our murine
tumors strongly resemble the human Proneural GBM
subtype, and found that the Proneural group with high
IL1β expression showed significant survival differences
compared to patients with Proneural tumors with low IL1β
expression (Fig. 4D). IL1β expression was not associated
with survival in the other GBM subtypes.

Next we examined whether IL1β can promote
tumor growth in our murine Proneural GBM model. We
generated primary cultures from PDGFB-driven gliomas
generated in NiG mice. Freshly isolated tumor cells were
cultured in two different conditions: the first condition was
chosen to enrich for GSCs (serum-free neural stem cell
medium supplemented with EGF and bFGF), while the
second condition was chosen to enrich the main/bulk tumor
population (10% FBS in DMEM medium). We performed
MTT assays for the dose response to recombinant IL1β
and showed that the most effective dose for growth was
100pM (data not shown). While 24h incubation with IL1β
showed significant increases in growth/viability in GSCenriching conditions (Fig. 5B, left panel), IL1β mediated
no growth advantage for cells cultured in FBS-containing
medium (Fig. 5B, right panel). These data suggest that
IL1β signaling selectively affects cells grown in GSCenriching conditions. Next we evaluated IL1R1 expression
and showed that both mRNA and protein are expressed
in GBM cells (Fig. S4A and S4B). In response to IL1β
binding to IL1R1, a complex sequence of combinatorial
phosphorylation and ubiquitination events results in
activation of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) signaling and the
JNK and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways,
which cooperatively induce the expression of canonical

expression is up-regulated in human GBM and levels of expression correlate with Proneural patient survival. A) Relative mRNA expression
dot plots from freshly FACS-sorted CD11b+CD45+CX3CR1+ cells from the three genotypes showed no differences in TNF-α, iNOS or IL6
levels, B) while a significant dose-dependent increase was observed in IL1β expression levels. All samples were normalized to the mRNA
levels of β-actin and are presented as fold-change compare to naïve brains. A one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparisons test was
performed and demonstrated that there was a statistically significant dose-dependent increase in IL1β expression (*p < 0.05 (Cx3cr1GFP)
and **p < 0.001(Cx3cr1GFP/GFP) compared to B6). C) Relative IL1β mRNA expression in the four GBM subtypes of the TCGA data set.

Classical, respectively). D) Kaplan-Meier survival curves for the Proneural, Neural, Mesenchymal and Classical subtypes. High and Low
are defined as +/- 1 Standard Deviation for each subtype. Log-rank (Mantel-Cox-MC) tests and Gehan-Breslow-Wilcoxon tests (GBW)
were used to determine p values. The only significant difference in survival was observed in Proneural patients (*p < 0.05 MC and **p <
0.01 GBW).

IκBα, IL1α, IL1β, MKP-1) via transcriptional and posttranslational modifications (see detailed discussion in
review [27]). Next we examined what downstream targets
were activated in response to IL1β treatment in GSCs.
IL1β treatment induced activation of the p38 MAPK

pathway in all four mouse GSC lines tested, but not
extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) (Fig. 5C, Fig.
S5). p38 MAPK has been shown to play important roles in
glioma invasion, progression and therapy resistance [28].
CCL2 has been reported to be one of the canonical IL1β
target genes and is a known chemoattractant ligand for

of the MTT assay performed on GBM spheres, which were cultured in NSC (left) or 10% FBS (right) with or without IL1β 24h later. These
data show that while there was no significant increase in the growth in FBS, there was a significant difference in NSC conditions. We used
three independent primary tumors to derive three independent glioma lines for two conditions. Blue squares show the growth of the original
tumor and they are connected to red squares that represent the growth in response to IL1β; values on the graphs represent fold increase
in growth/viability in response to IL1β compare to control growth. An unpaired t-test was used to determine the fold change compare to

pathways 0, 10, 30 and 60 minutes after 100pM IL1β treatment. The Western blots shown were performed on the GBM 1 and GBM 2 lines
(cultured in Geltrex). Similar results were obtained on GBM sphere 3. D) Relative mRNA expression dot plots for CCL2 from glioma cells

the CCR2 receptor, which is expressed in inflammatory
monocytes and has been shown to be important for exit of
monocytes from the bone marrow to the blood circulation
and subsequent trafficking into the site of inflammation
[29]. Next we examined whether CCL2 is upregulated
by IL1β treatment in cultured glioma cells. There was
significant upregulation of CCL2 mRNA (Fig. 5D) and
protein expression levels (Fig. 5E) independent of culture

conditions, whereas CCR2 was preferentially expressed
by inflammatory monocytes and macrophages (Fig. 5F).
Since our data showed that IL1β regulates CCL2 mRNA
expression in glioma cells, we examined whether there was
a correlation between IL1β and CCL2 mRNA expression
levels in human GBM subtypes (from TCGA database)
and murine GBM. We observed a statistically significant
positive linear association between IL1β and CCL2 mRNA

expression levels both in human Proneural and murine
GBM (Fig. 5G). There was a significant positive linear
association in the Classical subtype, but not in the Neural
and Mesenchymal subtypes (Fig. S6). Together, these
data help explain the increased inflammatory monocyte
infiltration into GBM generated in the Cx3cr1-deficient
background. Since Cx3cr1-deficient inflammatory
monocytes and monocyte-derived macrophages express
higher levels of IL1β compared to heterozygous Cx3cr1
and WT tumors, they induce increases in CCL2 expression
by glioma cells, which in turn causes the recruitment
of more CCR2-positive inflammatory monocytes into
the tumor, as shown in Fig. 2A and 2B. IL1β from
inflammatory monocytes has a paracrine effect on glioma
cells and induces increased levels of CCL2 in tumor cells,
which in turn has a paracrine effect on inflammatory

monocytes, resulting in increased infiltration.

Cx3cr1 loss via increased expression of IL1β leads
to an enhanced glioma stem cell phenotype in vitro
and in vivo
We observed an increase in PVA, where glioma stem
cells are localized, in host Cx3cr1-deficient tumors. We
therefore examined whether IL1β-treated glioma cells that
were maintained in GSC-enriching medium would show
an increase in the glioma stem cell population in vitro.
We used the SP assay, which is a well-accepted method
of identifying glioma stem cells in murine and human
models. Freshly isolated cells from tumors were cultured
in two different conditions, GSC-enriching conditions and
the main/bulk-enriching (10% FBS in DMEM medium)

condition. IL1β significantly increased the percentage
of SP cells in three independent tumor-derived primary
cells in GSC-enriching medium, while no increase was
observed in cells that were cultured in serum (Fig. 6A).
Therefore, we tested whether IL1β treatment could induce
expression of stem-like cell markers. Nanog and Oct4
expression were increased, whereas Sox2 expression
levels were not increased (Fig. 6B). This observation is
attributable to the fact that Sox2 is both a GSC marker
and is also associated with the Proneural molecular
subtype in human [30], so its expression can be extended
beyond GSCs in mouse tumors as well (data not shown).
CD44 and Musashi expression were not increased (Fig.
6B). Together, these data suggest that monocytes and
macrophages can drive elements of a stem cell phenotype
in PDGFB-induced gliomas via IL1β expression.
It was also of interest to determine whether the
effect of IL1β on the glioma stem cell phenotype occurs
in human GSCs. In view of our finding that high IL1β
expression correlated with poor survival only in human
Proneural GBM, we treated two human Proneural GBM
GSCs with human IL1β for two weeks. By using a
limited dilution assay, we showed that self-renewal of
both GSCs7-11 and 827 [31, 32] were increased by IL1β
compared to control (Fig. S7).
To confirm whether this effect of IL1β on the stem
cell phenotype is Cx3cr1-dependent, we analyzed tumors
generated in B6, Cx3cr1GFP/+ and Cx3cr1GFP/GFP mice at the
end-points of survival. We observed large variability in the
% SP (7-45%) in tumors from all three genotypes, which
was associated with the time of survival of tumor-bearing
mice. We normalized SP from tumors in Cx3cr1GFP/+ and
Cx3cr1GFP/GFP mice to B6 tumors based on the time of
tumor development and represented it as relative SP, which
was much higher in tumors from Cx3cr1GFP/GFP compared
to Cx3cr1GFP/+ and B6 (Fig. 6C). These data suggest that
the in vitro effects of IL1β on stemness are driven by
Cx3cr1 deficiency in vivo. Since it has been shown that
increased SP in gliomas correlates with unregulated CD44
expression and radiation resistance in the same murine
GBM model, we examined whether CD44 expression is
increased in PVA area when tumors from Cx3cr1GFP/GFP
mice are compared to Cx3cr1GFP/+ and B6. We did observe
an increase in CD44-positive areas in tumors generated in
Cx3cr1GFP/GFP mice compared to Cx3cr1GFP/+ and B6 (Fig.
S8).

in peri-tumoral areas in tumors from the three genotypes
by quantifying the total number of Iba1+ cells in two
concentric peri-tumoral layers of tissue (Fig. 7A and 7B).
There were no significant differences in the numbers of
Iba1+ cells in the first and second peri-tumoral layers in
GBM tissue from B6 and Cx3cr1GFP/+ mice compared to
the tumors in Cx3cr1GFP/GFP mice. These data suggest that
loss of Cx3cr1 does not affect accumulation of microglia
in peri-tumoral areas. In order to assess the functional
consequences of CX3CR1 deficiency on microglial
migration and the effect it has on tumor growth, we
generated gliomas ex vivo in naïve organotypic slice
cultures generated from B6, Cx3cr1GFP/+ and Cx3cr1GFP/GFP
mice as described in Supplemental Figure 9. This method
allowed us to investigate the role of microglial CX3CR1
on tumor growth. There were no significant differences in
the size of the tumors at 6 days post-tumor cell inoculation.
Next, we fixed the organotypic slices, sectioned them into
8μm sections, and quantified GFP+ microglial density
in tumors generated ex vivo in slices from the three
genotypes. Quantification of GFP+ microglia inside of
the tumor and inner and outer peri-tumoral areas showed
no significant differences in microglia density whether
one or two copies of Cx3cr1 were deleted. These data
suggest that the effect of Cx3cr1 loss on tumor growth and
increased stem cell-like cell phenotype in vivo is driven by
increased infiltration of inflammatory monocytes and their
increased expression of IL1β.

DISCUSSION
In recent years, accumulating evidence from several
tumor types has shown the importance of non-neoplastic
cells in the tumor microenvironment for the maintenance
of cancer growth and response to therapy. In gliomas,
microglia and macrophages together represent the most
abundant non-neoplastic cell types, which are present
in both low- and high-grade gliomas. While in lowgrade gliomas, the main population of macrophages is
resident brain microglia [33], we show here that in highgrade gliomas, one finds a mixture of resident microglia,
inflammatory monocytes and macrophages. Over the last
decade, our knowledge of the role of microglia in gliomas
has evolved significantly [8], but we have yet to determine
the mechanism by which bone marrow-derived monocytes
infiltrate into GBM, their fate following infiltration, or
their role in GBM growth and how different they are
from microglia. These are all valid questions considering
major differences in the origin and life span of these
cells. Monocytes are myeloid-derived cells that belong
to the mononuclear phagocyte system. They arise from
hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow, are released
into the bloodstream, and colonize peripheral organs in
normal and inflammatory conditions [34], where they
differentiate into macrophages or dendritic cells and have
multiple functions in homeostasis and innate and acquired

Loss of Cx3cr1 has no impact on microglia/
macrophage accumulation in peri-tumoral areas
or on tumor growth in organotypic slice cultures
Loss of one copy of the Cx3cr1 gene has been
shown to reduce accumulation of microglia (by 50%)
and delay optic nerve glioma development [33]. Thus we
decided to evaluate microglia/macrophage accumulation

immunity. Microglia, on the other hand, originate from
yolk sac progenitors that migrate into the brain in the early
stages of development (E10.5) and are maintained locally
via self-renewal [35].
In this study we abrogated CX3CR1/CX3CL1
signaling in both microglia and inflammatory
monocytes and studied the effects on glioma growth
and on the behavior of both cell populations. First, we
showed that the loss of CX3CR1 signaling in the host
microenvironment results in increased GBM formation
and shortened tumor latency. One correlative study
showed that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs
heterozygous-CX3CR1-I249) in the human Cx3cr1 gene
resulted in decreased microglial infiltration and longer
survival of GBM patients that underwent surgery [36],
although, whether the post-surgery tissue contained
inflammatory monocytes or only microglia was not
investigated. Further studies are warranted to investigate
the role of the CX3CR1-I249 polymorphism based on
genetic subtypes of glioma. Another report using GL261
murine glioma cells demonstrated that loss of Cx3cr1
in the host microenvironment has only a slight effect on
survival of tumor-bearing mice and no differences were
observed in the density of tumor-infiltrated immune cells
or microglial accumulation [37]. These differences can
be partially explained by differences in the properties of
glioma cells that have been used in transplant experiments.
In contrast to the GL261 model, data from the experiments
using GEMM of low-grade gliomas showed that decreased
expression of CX3CR1 resulted in delayed tumor growth
and decreased accumulation of microglia in tumors;
most importantly the authors reported that over 95% of
macrophages in low-grade gliomas are microglia [33].
Differences in all the above-mentioned studies and our
current study show that the role of CX3CR1/CX3CL1 can
vary depending on the grade and subtype of glioma. This
can be partially attributed to the fact that GBM subtypes
show activation of different core signaling pathways.
Further studies are warranted to determine whether
monocyte infiltration also occurs in other GBM subtypes.
Here we demonstrated that loss of Cx3cr1 in the host
microenvironment resulted in increased accumulation of
bone marrow-derived Ly6-Chigh “inflammatory” monocytes
in GBM, in contrast to microglia in low-grade gliomas.
Our finding of increased monocyte infiltration as
a result of Cx3cr1 loss in GBM shows similarity with
recent data in myelorestoration, where the CX3CR1/
CX3CL1 axis controls the release of Ly-6Chigh monocytes
from marrow such that in Cx3cr1GFP/GFP mice, Ly-6C
high
monocytes accumulated less rapidly in the marrow
but recovered faster in the blood, resulting in more
accumulation into the spleen [38]. Increased inflammatory
monocyte accumulation in GBM as a result of Cx3cr1 loss
is further supported by data showing that human CX3CL1
(also known as fractalkine) antagonizes transendothelial
migration and chemotaxis of freshly isolated human
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

monocytes induced by CCL2. Our PDGFB-driven murine
GBM significantly up-regulated levels of CCL2 mRNA
and protein expression (unpublished data from our
laboratory). This would help explain the fact that tumor
cells up-regulate CCL2 to attract monocyte infiltration
into GBM, while on the other hand they do not express
CX3CL1. Increased monocyte infiltration as a result
of Cx3cr1 loss in our GBM model is further supported
by a study showing formation of leaky and immature
microvessels lacking CX3CR1-positive smooth musclelike cells, extracellular collagen, and basement membrane
laminin in Cx3cr1GFP/GFP but not in Cx3cr1GFP/+ mice, when
matrigel plugs were implanted [39]. We also demonstrated
that loss of CX3CR1 results in dose-dependent increases
in IL1β expression, which in turn upregulates CCL2
expression and recruits more monocytes. Thus when
the loss of Cx3cr1 resulted in further increases in
CCL2 expression, we observed greater “inflammatory”
monocyte infiltration into GBM, mainly localizing in the
PVA. Similar results with increased IL1β resulting from
loss of Cx3cr1 were shown in two Alzheimer’s disease
mouse models and other CNS diseases [18, 20]. IL1β
was also shown to increase the self-renewal of intestinal
epithelial stem cells [40]. Recently, we have demonstrated
the existence and complexity of the PVA in the PDGF
subgroup of human gliomas and in our PDGF-driven
mouse gliomas. The PVA of PDGF-driven human and
mouse gliomas is a complex structure, which contains a
treatment-resistant, nestin-positive cancer stem-like cell
population [16]. In gliomas, it has been shown that IL1β
in combination with TGFβ increases the neurosphereforming ability and tumorigenicity of the LN-229 glioma
cell line, although the mechanism was not elucidated [41].
Our data demonstrate that IL1β in GSCs induces activation
of p38 MAPK and enhances the GSC phenotype in vitro
and in vivo, which seems to be Cx3cr1-dependent. These
effects of IL1β can partially explain the tumor-promoting
effect of CX3CR1 in our mouse model of GBM. In human
GBM, high expression of IL1β was also correlated with
shorter survival only in Proneural GBM patients. IL1β
treatment also increases the stem cell frequency in two
proneural human GSC lines. Only in Proneural and murine
GBM did we observe significant positive correlations
between expression levels of CCL2 and IL1β.
Our data demonstrate that while increasing
monocyte infiltration and tumor-promoting effects,
loss of Cx3cr1 has no impact on microglia/macrophage
accumulation in peri-tumoral areas in vivo or in
organotypic slice cultures of gliomas ex vivo. The use of
organotypic slice cultures allowed us to generate gliomas
in a monocyte-free environment, where we demonstrated
that loss of Cx3cr1 in microglia had no impact on glioma
growth. These results suggest that the tumor-promoting
effect produced by the loss of Cx3cr1 is a result of
infiltrating inflammatory monocytes from the blood
circulation. This observation is further supported by data

showing that loss of Cx3cr1 has no impact on infiltration
of other immune cells from the blood, which include
neutrophils and dendritic cells (DCs). Though it has
previously been proposed that CNS DCs can arise from
transformed microglia in vitro in which microglia upregulate CD11c in the presence of GM-CSF [42], in our
GBM model we did not observe up-regulation of CD11c
in microglia or in the bone marrow-derived CD45hiCD11b+
population.
Taken together, our results provide insights into
the differences in CX3CR1 signaling in microglia versus
bone marrow-derived “inflammatory” monocytes,
which includes migration and tumor-promoting effects.
In light of these data, the terms “Tumor-associated
macrophages (TAMs)” that are widely used in the glioma
literature should be used very carefully, as this is a highly
heterogeneous population that includes resident brain
microglia, infiltrating blood monocytes, and macrophages,
showing very different functions. Based on our data,
CX3CR1 signaling has differential functions in bone
marrow-derived inflammatory monocytes versus resident
microglia. These data also confer the importance of
studying the biology of inflammatory monocytes in the
context of GBM as well as the molecules that they secrete
to promote tumor growth. IL1β is one example that we
identified in these studies, but this is likely only one of
many remaining to be identified.

Western blotting and PCR.

Generation of tumors
Transgenic mice (Gli-Luciferase; Nestin-tv-a;Ink4aArf−/−;ptenfl/fl referred to as NiG) were anesthetized with
intraperitoneal injections of a mixture of ketamine
(0.1 mg/g) and xylazine (0.02 mg/g). One microliter of
4X104 cell suspension containing either RCAS-PDGFB-HA or RCAS-PDGFB-RFP + RCAS-Cre transfected
(1:1 ratio) DF1 cells was delivered using a 30-gauge
needle attached to a Hamilton syringe and stereotactic
fixation device (Stoelting, Wood Dale, IL). Locations
were determined according to a mouse brain atlas [43].
Cells were injected into the right frontal striatum with the
following coordinates from bregma: AP (anterior) 1.0 mm,
ML (medial/lateral) 1.0 mm, and DV (dorsal/ventral) 2.0
mm. Mice were monitored carefully and were sacrificed if
they displayed lethargy or head tilt due to tumor burden.

Orthotopic glioma generation
The same procedure was used as described above,
except 2.5X104 of freshly-dissociated tumor cells were
injected into the frontal striatum of recipient animals.
Two or three tumors were used for obtaining single cells
for orthotopic glioma generation in B6, Cx3cr1GFP+, and
Cx3cr1GFP/GFP. The GBM grade of donor tumors was
validated by H&E staining. The tumor cell injections
into B6, Cx3cr1GFP+, and Cx3cr1GFP/GFP recipients were
performed on the same day with the same cells.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Mice

Bioluminescence imaging (BLI)

Animals were housed in the Cleveland Clinic
Biological Resource Unit. All experimental procedures
were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and
Use Committee of the Cleveland Clinic (Animal
Protocol 2013-1029). Mice (6-10 weeks old) were used
in all experiments. We used age and sex as criteria to
equally distribute mice from different genotypes for
all experiments. Gli-Luciferase; Nestin-tv-a;Ink4aArf−/−;ptenfl/fl mice were generated as previously described.
Cx3cr1GFP+, Cx3cr1GFP/GFP mice were generated from
heterozygous breeding pairs, backcrossed for more than
10 generations to B6 [24].

Mice were anesthetized with 3% isoflurane and
hair covering the head was shaved before retro-orbital
injection with 75mg/kg body weight of D-luciferin (30mg
luciferin/ml dH2O at 2.5 μl per gram mouse weight).
One minute after injection of D-luciferin, images were
acquired for 8 min with an IVIS 100 (Xenogen) imaging
system. A photographic image was taken onto which the
pseudocolor image representing the spatial distribution
of photon count was projected. A circular region (1.4cm
diameter) of interest (ROI) covering the tumor region was
defined and used to quantify the bioluminescent signals in
all experiments. All representative images were formatted
using the same maximum and minimum threshold
parameters.

Cell cultures and transfection
DF-1 cells were purchased from ATCC, Manassas,
VA. Cells were grown at 39oC according to instructions
from ATCC. Transfections with RCAS-PDGFB-HA,
RCAS-PDGFB-SV40-RFP and RCAS-CRE were
performed using a Fugene 6 transfection kit (Roche,
Mannheim, Germany) according to manufacturer’s
instructions. Transfection efficacies were assessed by

Tissue processing
Animals were anesthetized with a mixture
of ketamine (0.15 mg/g) and xylazine (0.02 mg/g),
perfused with ice-cold Ringer’s solution, and sacrificed.

Brains were removed and processed according to
the different applications. For H&E validation and
immunohistochemistry, brains were fixed in 10% neutral
buffered formalin for 72 hours at RT, processed in a
tissue processer (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany), embedded
in paraffin, sectioned (5 μm), and slide-mounted. For
immunofluorescent staining, brains were fixed in 4%

normalized to a 1600 x 200 pixel area (1360x170 μm2).

Flow cytometry
For FACS analysis, brains were digested in 0.25%
Trypsin/EDTA without phenol red at 37°C for 10 minutes
(GBM) or 30 minutes (naïve brains, without cerebellum).
Digestion was stopped by adding 2 volumes of RPMI
medium containing 10% FBS. Cells were passed through
a 40 μm cell strainer, centrifuged and resuspended in 30%
Percoll (GE Healthcare, Princeton, NJ) solution, and laid
above a 70% Percoll layer (diluted in RPM medium with
1% FBS). Cells were separated by centrifuging at 800xg
for 30 minutes at 4°C. Cells from the 30%/70% Percoll
interphases were collected and washed with FACS buffer
(DPBS with 0.5% BSA) and blocked with 100 μl of 2x
blocking solution (2% FBS, 5% normal rat serum, 5%
normal mouse serum, 5% normal rabbit serum, 10 μg/ml
2.4g2 anti-FcR and 0.2% NaN3 in DPBS) on ice for 30
minutes. Cells were then stained with various antibodies
(see the list of antibodies in Supplemental Table 1A) on ice
for 30 minutes and washed with FACS buffer. For blood
analysis, blood samples were taken via tail vein bleeding,
lysed with RBC lysis buffer (Biolegend, San Diego, CA),
washed with FACS buffer, counted with a hemocytometer,
and stained using the same protocol before analyzing. The
list of antibodies is included in Table S1A. All data were
collected on a LSR II Fortessa (BD Biosciences, San Jose,
CA) and analyzed using FlowJo 9 software (Tree Star Inc.,
Ashland, OR).
For tumor cell sorting, brains were digested for
15 minutes (GBM) or 30 minutes (naïve brains, without
cerebellum) at 37°C in 5 ml of freshly prepared digestion
solution (0.94 mg/ml papain (Worthington), 0.48 mM
EDTA, 0.18 mg/ml N-acetyl-L-cysteine and 0.06mg/ml
DNase I (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) diluted in Earl’s
Balanced Salt Solution (EBSS)). Two ml of Ovomucoid
solution (0.71 mg/ml dissolved in Neural Stem Cell (NSC)
Basal Medium) was used to terminate the digestion. Cells
were washed in NSC Basal Medium and passed through a
40 μm cell strainer before sorting.
For immune cell sorting, cells were further washed
with HBSS, resuspended in 30% Percoll solution
(prepared with RPMI medium with 1% FBS), and placed
under a HBSS aqua phase. Cells were centrifuged (low
acceleration and no brake) at 950xg for 20 minutes at
4°C. Pelleted cells were washed with FACS buffer before
sorting. Staining was performed as described above.

Immunoflurescent staining (IF)
5 μm and 8 μm coronal sections were used for
paraffin-embedded and frozen sections in all histological
studies. The following antibodies were used at the stated
dilutions: rabbit polyclonal anti-Iba1, 1:100 (Wako Pure
Chemicals, Osaka Japan); rabbit polyclonal anti-GFP,
1:100 (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY); rabbit
polyclonal anti-Olig2, 1:250 (Chemicon, Temecula
CA); mouse monoclonal anti-PCNA, 1:2000 (DAKO,
Glostrup, Denmark); and rat monoclonal anti-CD31,
1:100 (Dianova, Germany), rabbit polyclonal cleaved
caspase 3, 1:100 (Cell signaling, Danvers, MA), rat antiBrdU, 1:100 (BIO-RAD, Hercules, CA). For IF staining,
secondary antibodies conjugated to different Alexa-Fluor
dyes (488 nm, 555 nm, 647 nm from Life Technologies,
Grand Island, NY) at a dilution of 1:500 in PBS/2% BSA
were applied. For nuclear counterstaining, DAPI was used
(Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO).

BrdU incorporation
At the end point of survival, tumor-bearing mice
were given i.p. two pulses every 6 hours (at 10 mg/kg
body weight, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) for 12 hours
before they were sacrificed.

Quantification of IF
For quantification of Iba1-positive cells and CD31
staining (Fig. 3), five to ten images (20x) of perivascular
regions were taken per mouse brain using CD31 staining
as a reference. The total numbers of Iba1-positive cells as
well as CD31-positive areas were assessed using ImageJ.
For Iba1-positive cell quantification in peri-tumoral
areas (Fig. 6), adjacent 10x images (1600 x 1200 pixels,
300 dpi) were taken and recomposed using Photoshop
software (Adobe System Incorporated); an outline of the
tumor border was then determined by DAPI staining and
two layers (200 pixels or 240 μm width) outside of this
border were then determined and named as the inner and
outer layers. Cell numbers were counted with ImageJ and

(Braun Melsungen, Germany), 0.8 mg/ml vitamin C
(Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), 100 U/ml penicillin, 100
mg/ml streptomycin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), and
5 mM Tris in DMEM (Life Technologies, Grand Island,
NY).

Tumor dissociation and primary cell cultures
PDGF-driven tumors were dissociated as described
in the flow cytometry section above. Briefly, tumors were
dissected and collected in basal neural stem cell culture
medium. Five ml of digestion solution per tumor was
used to digest tissues. Cells were consecutively washed
and resuspended to obtain a single cell suspension. For
tumorsphere cultures, cells were seeded at 50x104 cells/
ml and grown in mouse neurosphere medium (Stem Cell
Technologies, Vancouver, Canada) supplemented with
10ng/ml hEGF, 20 ng/ml basic-hFGF, 1 mg/ml Heparin,
and NSC Proliferation Supplements. Fresh medium was
added to the cultures every 48 hours before treatment. For
primary monolayer cultures, cells were cultured in high
glucose DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS; medium
was changed every 2 days. For IL-1β treatment and
MTT assays, cells were grown as adherent monolayer
cultures on Geltrex-coated tissue culture plasticware
(Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY), which were
prepared according to manufacturer’s instructions.
This approach for in vitro experiments provided bettercontrolled and more reproducible results compared to
when cells are grown as neurospheres. When GSCs are
grown as neurospheres, the size of the neurospheres is
highly variable and can greatly impact the availability of
exogenous IL1β for cells in the core of spheres. It becomes
especially crucial when time points for collecting samples
after adding exogenous IL1β are short.

Tumor cell injections into cultured brain slices
One day after cutting, 5000 cultured RCASPDGFB-SV40-RFP tumor cells in a volume of 0.1µl were
injected into the slices using a Hamilton syringe mounted
to a micromanipulator. An injection canal was formed that
reached 150 µm deep into the 250 µm-thick slice. The
needle was then retracted by 50µm, leaving an injection
cavity of approximately 50µm. The cell suspension
was slowly injected over 30 seconds and subsequently
the syringe was slowly pulled out in 10µm incremental
steps over 60 seconds. To ensure identical experimental
conditions, gliomas were always inoculated into the same
area. Tumor sizes were determined 6 and 12 days postinjection by fluorescence microscopy (Axiovert 135,
Carl Zeiss, Jena Germany) and the fluorescent area was
evaluated with Fiji ImageJ.

Re-cutting of cultured slices
For analysis of microglial invasion into tumor areas,
slices were fixed 4 days post-injection of tumor cells with
4% PFA for 1 hour and subsequently stored in 30% sucrose
until further use. Fixed slices were mounted on plaincut blocks of Tissue-Tek O.C.T. (Sakura, Tokyo, Japan),
covered with more Tissue-Tek O.C.T., and subsequently
cut into 10µm sections using a Leica CM1950 Cryostat
(Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany). Confocal
images were prepared using a Leica TCS SPE confocal

Organotypic slice cultures
P14-P16 Cx3cr1GFP/GFP, Cx3cr1GFP/+, and B6
littermate mice were decapitated and brains were removed
and placed in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)
under sterile conditions. The forebrain was dissected

FBS DMEM or neural stem cell medium without bFGF
or EGF. Cells were starved for 16h before IL1β treatment,
followed by 24 hours of 100pM of IL1β (401-ML-005/
CF R&D, Minneapolis, MN) diluted in 1% FBS DMEM
medium or complete neural stem cell medium (with EGF
and FGF) for FBS cultures and neural stem cell cultures,
respectively. MTT assays (TOX1-1KT) were performed
according to the manufacturer’s instructions (SigmaAldrich, St. Louis, MO).

Immunoblot analysis
Antibody against actin was purchased from
Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, Santa Cruz, CA. Cells
were harvested and lysed in a Triton-containing lysis
buffer (0.5% Triton X-100, 20mM HEPES (pH 7.4),
150 mM NaCl, 12.5 mM β-glycerophosphate, 1.5 mM
MgCl2, 10 mM NaF, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM sodium
orthovanadate, 2mM EGTA, 1mM phenylmethylsulfonyl
fluoride and complete protease inhibitor cocktail from
Roche). Cell lysates were then separated by 10%
SDS-PAGE, transferred to Immobilon-P membranes
(Millipore), and subjected to immunoblotting. Antibodies
against phosphorylated JNK, p38 (Thr180/Tyr182),
and Erk1/2 (Thr202/Tyr204) were purchased from Cell
Signaling, Danvers, MA. Quantification of western
blots was performed using ImageJ. Intensity values for
phosphorylated proteins were normalized per totals,
which were first normalized per actin of each blot. Four
independent primary mouse tumor-derived GSCs were
used for western blots.

Side population analysis (SP) by FACS
SP analysis was performed as described previously.
Briefly, after tumor dissociation, cells were incubated at
37ºC with (controls) or without (samples) Fumitremorgin
C (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), followed by staining
with Dyecycle Violet (Life Technologies, Grand Island,
NY) at 37ºC for 90 minutes. Cells were washed and
stained with propidium iodide (PI) before analyzing.
Signals were excited by the violet laser (407 nm) on LSR
Fortessa. DCV-red and DCV-blue signals were collected
through 670/30 nm and 450/50 nm filters, respectively. For
in vitro experiments, cells were incubated with or without
100 pM IL1β, collected, and analyzed for SP as described
above.

Limiting Dilution Assay (LDA)

TCGA analysis

LDA was performed in 96-well plates. Briefly,
dissociated cells were seeded at a range of 1–100 cells
per well with or without bFGF and EGF and then 400 pM
IL1β was added every 3 days. Cells were incubated at
37°C for 2 weeks. At the time of quantification, each well
was examined for the formation of tumor spheres. Stem
cell frequency and p-values were calculated using a webbased tool “ELDA” (extreme limiting dilution analysis),
which is available on the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute
of Medical Research web site (http://bioinf.wehi.edu.au/
software/elda/).
The 827 and GSC7-11 cells were generously
provided by Drs. Jeognwu Lee and Erik Sulman. Both cell
lines display characteristics of the Proneural subtype, as
revealed by RNA-seq, by centroid analysis (827) [31], and
by microarray analysis using the unsupervised algorithm
(GSC7-11) [32]. GSCs were cultured in neurobasal media
with N2 and B27 supplements (0.5× each; Invitrogen) and
human recombinant bFGF and EGF (25 ng/ml each; R&D
Systems) (NBE condition).

Expression values and patients survival data for
each gene of interest were obtained from the MSKCC
computational biology cancer genomics portal-cBioPortal
(http://www.cbioportal.org/cgx/index.do) which has
annotated TCGA data [44, 45]. (Study: Glioblastoma
multiforme, TCGA Provisional, mRNA Expression
z-Scores (microarray), accessed in June 2014. Tumor
subtype classification was previously described [3].

Statistical analysis
Graphs were created using GraphPad Prism 6
(GraphPad Software Inc., La Jolla, CA) and were analyzed
using an unpaired parametric two-tailed t-test, assuming
equal standard deviations. One-way ANOVA was used
in experiments having more than one group to compare
to controls. Test details are included in appropriate figure
legends; (*) P < 0.05; (**) P < 0.01; (***) P < 0.001; (no
asterisks) not significant.
