BACKGROUND: The Cancer and Leukemia Group B evaluated oral topotecan administered at 2 schedules
and doses for myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). METHODS: Patients with previously untreated primary or
therapy-related MDS were eligible. Patients with refractory anemia (RA), RA with ringed sideroblasts, or refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia (RCMD) were eligible only if they were dependent on erythrocyte transfusion, had a platelet count <50,000/lL, or had an absolute neutrophil count <1000/lL with a
recent infection that required antibiotics. Patients were randomized to receive oral topotecan either at a
dose of 1.2 mg/m2 twice daily for 5 days (Arm A) or once daily for 10 days (Arm B) repeated every 21 days
for at least 2 cycles. Responding patients continued until they developed disease progression or unacceptable toxicity or until they had received 2 cycles beyond a complete response. RESULTS: Ninety patients

received treatment, including 46 patients on Arm A and 44 patients on Arm B. Partial responses with
improvement in all 3 cell lines occurred in 6 patients (7%), and hematologic improvement (in 1 or 2 cell lines)
was observed in 21 patients (23%), for an overall response rate of 30%. Response duration was longer on
Arm A (23 months vs 14 months; P ¼ .02). Seven of 14 patients with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia
responded. There were 8 treatment-related deaths from infection (6 deaths) and bleeding (2 deaths). Diarrhea was the most frequent nonhematologic toxicity (grade 3, 11%; grade 4, 2%; grading determined according to the National Cancer Institute Comman Toxicity Criteria v.2.0).

The myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are clonal disorders characterized by cytopenias and evidence of morphologic dysplasia in 1 or more hematopoietic cell line.
The French-American-British (FAB) classification categorized these syndromes into 5 subtypes with differing morphologic features and prognoses.1 The more recent World
Health Organization (WHO) classification divides MDS
into 8 entities based on morphologic, cytogenetic, and
clinical parameters.2 An International Prognostic Scoring
System (IPSS) has been developed that divides patients
into outcome groups based on percentage of bone marrow
blasts, karyotype, and degree and number of cytopenia.3
Patients often die of infection or complications of bleeding, or the disease evolves to acute myeloid leukemia
(AML). The major objectives of therapy in MDS are either
to alter the natural history or to reduce the morbidity of the
chronic cytopenias and attendant transfusion requirements.
Many agents have been evaluated in MDS, including androgens, corticosteroids, cytokines (such as granulocytecolony-stimulating factor, granulocyte-macrophagecolonystimulating factor, and epoetin), vitamin D, and retinoids,
in an attempt to induce differentiation in the dysplastic cell
lines.4-7 More recent trials have evaluated the activity of
novel agents, such as thalidomide, tipifarnib, arsenic trioxide, and amifostine.8-11 None of these agents have demonstrated improved long-term outcomes, although the use of
cytokines can improve single-lineage cytopenias transiently.12 A large randomized trial of low-dose cytarabine
compared with best supportive care yielded a complete
response (CR) rate of only 8% and a median CR
duration of 4 months. The median survival durations in the
Cancer

January 1, 2009

treated and untreated groups were 36 weeks and 28 weeks,
respectively, which were not statistically significantly
different.13
Recently, both of the DNA methyltransferase inhibitors, azacitidine and decitabine, have been approved for
MDS based on data from randomized trials comparing 1 of
these agents plus best supportive care with best supportive
care alone.14-16 Most recently, it was reported that lenalinomide yielded cytogenetic CR and transfusion independence
in the subset of MDS patients with del(5q)17 and in a smaller
number of patients without this cytogenetic abnormality.18
To our knowledge to date, only azacitidine and decitabine
have been approved for all categories of MDS, because they
prolong the time to AML or death and reduce symptoms
from cytopenias.14-16,19
Investigators at The University of Texas M. D.
Anderson Cancer Center reported on the activity of topotecan, a topoisomerase I inhibitor, in patients with
MDS.20 When given intravenously at 2 mg/m2 daily for
5 days, 13 of 47 patients (28%) had a CR, and 6 others
(13%) had hematologic improvement (HI). Because of its
novel mechanism of action and acceptable toxicity profile
after intravenous administration, the Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) investigated the effectiveness of
oral topotecan in patients with MDS. Because of the older
age of many patients with MDS, defining a well tolerated
yet active oral outpatient therapy would be an important
advance. Certainly, the current availability of 3 new US
Food and Drug Administration-approved therapies for
MDS has resulted in better therapies for these patients.
However, many patients with greater numbers of blasts

and higher risk disease remain in need of therapy when
they do not respond to these agents.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Selection
Patients were considered eligible for the study if they had
primary or therapy-related MDS that previously was
untreated with any cytotoxic agent or cytokine therapy for
MDS except epoetin. Patients who had refractory anemia
(RA) with excess blasts (RAEB), RA with excess blasts in
transformation (RAEB-T), and chronic myelomonocytic
leukemia (CMML) were eligible independent of the presence or absence of cytopenias. Patients who had RA, RA
with ringed sideroblasts, or refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia (RCMD) were required to meet 1 of
the following criteria: erythrocyte transfusion dependence
with >4 U transfused in the 3 months before registration,
platelet count <50,000/lL, or an absolute neutrophil
count (ANC) <1000/lL with a recent infection requiring
antibiotics. The FAB classification was used at patient
enrollment with the category of RCMD added and
defined in the protocol. Patients who had received prior
chemotherapy or radiation therapy for a different disease
were required to have completed such therapy at least
12 months before registration. Additional eligibility criteria were a Karnofsky performance status from 0 to 3, bilirubin <1.5 mg/dL, aspartate aminotransferase <2 times
the upper limit of normal, and creatinine <1.5 mg/dL.
Pregnant and nursing women were excluded. Patient
registration and data collection were managed by the
CALGB Statistical Center. Data quality was ensured by
careful review of data by CALGB Statistical Center staff
and by the study chairperson. Statistical analyses were performed by the CALGB statisticians. Each participant
signed an institutional review board-approved, protocolspecific consent in accordance with federal and institutional guidelines.

that the patient’s ANC and platelet count had recovered
to pretreatment levels or to an ANC >1500/lL and a platelet count >50,000/lL for patients who had higher
blood counts before starting therapy. Subsequent cycles
were delayed until recovery of blood counts to these levels
had occurred. Patients who never recovered their prior
level of blood counts after 2 cycles were taken off of therapy and were considered nonresponders. Patients who
developed grade 3 or 4 mucositis or diarrhea had therapy
held until resolution, and all subsequent therapy was
administered at 75% of the previous dose. Patients were
assessed first for response after completing the first 2
cycles of therapy and then after every 4 cycles. Therapy
was continued for patients who had evidence of HI or a
partial response (PR) until progression or unacceptable
toxicity was observed. Patients who achieved a CR
received 2 additional cycles and were followed without
further therapy. Objectives of the study included the
estimation of the response rates (CR, PR, and HI) as well
as toxicity for the 2 schedules and doses of oral
topotecan.

Central Review and Response Definitions
Bone marrow aspirate slides and biopsies obtained within
2 weeks before patient registration were submitted for
central review (J.W.V.). This review was not completed
before patient disease stratification, randomization, or
treatment. Pretreatment bone marrow karyotypes underwent central cytogenetics review as part of CALGB study
8461.
Standard CALGB response criteria for MDS were
used as in the previous azacitidine study.14 A CR was
defined as normalization of all cytopenias, bone marrow
dysplasia, and blast count. A PR was defined as an
improvement of >50% in all cytopenias, whereas HI was
defined as an improvement of >50% in the cytopenia
existing in at least 1 lineage. An HI had to be maintained
without transfusion support for at least 4 weeks.

Treatment Program and Evaluations

Statistical Considerations

Registered patients were randomized to receive oral topotecan (GlaxoSmithKline) at a dose of 1.2 mg/m2 either
twice daily for 5 days (Arm A) or once daily for 10 days
(Arm B). Cycles were repeated every 21 days provided

The study design called for a total of 90 patients to be
randomized with equal allocation to each of the 2 arms of
this phase 2 trial, and we anticipated that 10% of the
patients would be ineligible after central pathology review.

Oral Topotecan in MDS / Grinblatt et al

The primary goal was to test within each of the 2 arms the
null hypothesis that the CR þ PR rate would be 10%
versus the alternative hypothesis that the CR þ PR rate
would be 25% with 40 eligible patients. If 6 patients
(15%) responded, then the null hypothesis would not be
rejected. If 7 patients (17.5%) responded, then the null
hypothesis would be rejected, and a phase 3 trial with that
arm of the trial would be considered. This single-stage
design had a power of 90% and a Type I error rate of
10%.
All patients who were treated on this protocol were
included in the analysis. The intent-to-treat approach was
adopted. Descriptive summary statistics are reported by
arm on patient characteristics at baseline (eg, demographics, disease characteristics, and various risk or diagnostic categories, including both those based on central
review and those based on institutional data). Outcome
variables, such as responses, overall survival (OS), and
time to AML or death (progression-free survival [PFS])
are summarized both by arm and overall for the 2 arms
combined. Analyses of the outcome endpoints by FAB
and IPSS risk groups based on central review, institutional
data, and central review supplemented with institutional
data (the best available data) were performed and descriptively compared, although only detailed results by the best
available data are reported in the article.
Response rates for CR þ PR and for CR þ PR þ HI
were estimated along with their 95% confidence intervals
(95% CIs), but only results for CR þ PR þ HI are
reported here. OS and PFS were analyzed with the
Kaplan-Meier product-limit method, and the median and
its 95% CI are reported. Comparisons among various
groups were performed with the Fisher exact test or the
chi-square test for discrete variables and with the log-rank
test for time-to-event variables. Note that, as a secondary
analysis, results within disease/risk subtypes are reported
separately, although the sample size of this trial was too
small for this analysis to be anything more than purely descriptive. Toxicities were tabulated by type and grade. A
P value <.05 was considered statistically significant. No
multiple testing adjustments were made, because most of
the testing was exploratory in nature.
Patient registration and data collection were managed by the CALGB Statistical Center. Data quality was
ensured by careful review of data by CALGB Statistical
Center staff and by the study chairperson. The medical
Cancer

records of randomly selected patients at each participating
institution were audited by members of the CALGB Data
Audit Committee.

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
One hundred patients with MDS were registered on
CALGB 19803 between March 1999 and May 2000
from 21 main member institutions and their affiliates.
Ten patients were registered but never received treatment;
these patients are not included in any analyses. Eighty
patients had adequate blood smears and bone marrow
slides submitted that underwent central morphology
review, and 10 patients did not; therefore the local institutional subclassification was used for the latter patients.
After central review, 77 patients were diagnosed with 1 of
4 FAB-defined subsets (Table 1); 3 patients had AML or
were unclassifiable. The results described below were
obtained primarily from central review and were supplemented by the institutional assessment when central
review was lacking, so that all treated patients were evaluated. Eighty-one of the 90 treated patients had either
central cytogenetic review (79 patients) or institutional
reports (2 patients) for pretreatment karyotypes so that an
IPSS score could be assigned.
Ninety patients were randomized and treated on
the study, with 46 on Arm A and 44 on Arm B. The median age at study entry was 70 years (range, 32-85 years).
The 2 arms were balanced with respect to age, sex, race,
performance status, FAB subtype, IPSS groups at baseline, and hematologic parameters at study registration
(Table 1).

Responses
No CRs were observed. PRs were observed in 6 patients
(7%), and HI was observed in 21 patients (23%) for an
overall response rate of 30%. The overall response rates
observed on the 2 arms of the study were similar: 33% on
Arm A and 27% on Arm B (Table 2). However, the
response durations were significantly longer on Arm A
than on Arm B; the median was 23 months (95% CI, 1529 months) on Arm A compared with 14 months (95%
CI, 8-17 months) on Arm B (P ¼ .02).

group and the absence of a cytogenetic abnormality were
correlated with the likelihood of response. It is noteworthy that patients who had more advanced MDS, ie,

higher overall response rate (43%; 95% CI, 27%%-61%)
than patients with abnormal cytogenetics (19%; 95% CI,
9%-34%). The overall response rates were very poor for
the 2 most frequent abnormalities observed; none of 12

Survival
Patients on Arm A tended to survive longer than those on
Arm B, but this difference was not statistically significant
(P ¼ .53) (Fig. 1). The median survival was 17 months
Cancer

January 1, 2009

for patients on Arm A (95% CI, 13-22 months) and 12
months for patients on Arm B (95% CI, 7-18 months).
Survival was correlated significantly with IPSS score, but
not with FAB classification, using the supplemented, centrally reviewed data (Table 4).
Time to AML or Death
The median time to AML or to death was 17 months for
patients on Arm A and 11 months for patients on Arm B
(P ¼ .3) (Table 5). This outcome parameter varied significantly (P ¼ .001) with IPSS score, but not by FAB group,
using the supplemented, centrally reviewed assignments.
The median time to AML or to death was 10 months for
patients who had abnormal cytogenetics (95% CI, 6-15
months) and 18 months for patients who had normal cytogenetics (95% CI, 13-26 months; P ¼ .45).
Toxicity
Toxicities were similar on the 2 treatment arms (Table 6).
There were 8 treatment-related deaths with oral topotecan. Five of those deaths resulted from documented infections, and 1 death resulted from febrile neutropenia
without a documented infection. There also were 2 deaths
related to hemorrhage; 1 of these patients was identified as
refractory to platelet transfusions after developing severe
treatment-related thrombocytopenia. Neutropenia was
common; grade 3 and 4 toxicities were reported in 17%

DISCUSSION
Topotecan interacts with the enzyme topoisomerase I in a
manner that stabilizes topoisomerase I-DNA complexes
and brings about cell death. The target enzyme is
expressed more abundantly in neoplastic cells than in normal cells.21 Objective antileukemia activity was observed
in 2 phase 1 studies of intravenous topotecan in patients
Cancer

with refractory acute leukemia.22,23 Subsequently, a phase
2 trial of intravenous topotecan at a dose of 2 mg/m2 daily
for 5 days in 47 patients with MDS (including 25 patients
with CMML) yielded a CR rate of 28% and HI in 13% of
patients. Among 8 patients with clonal cytogenetic abnormalities who achieved a CR, all became cytogenetically
normal, including 5 patients who had abnormalities of
91

chromosomes 5 or 7. Fever and mucositis were the most
common side effects. In that study, the 1-year survival rate
was 38%, and the median survival was 10.5 months.20 In
a subsequent trial, the dose of topotecan was lowered to
1.25 mg/m2 daily given as a continuous infusion over
5 days together with cytarabine at a dose of 1 g/m2 over
2 hours daily for the same 5 days.24 Thirty-five patients
were treated (3 patients with RAEB, 18 patients with
RAEB-T, and 14 patients with CMML); 46% were aged
>65 years, and 51% had cytogenetic abnormalities.
Twenty-two patients (63%) in that trial had a CR. Fever
occurred in 59% of the induction courses, and documented infections occurred in 48%, but severe mucositis
was reported in only 3%.
MDS is a disease mostly of older patients, many of
whom are not candidates for aggressive therapeutic interventions.25 Many of these patients have comorbid disorders that have an impact on their outcome. In the current
study, we evaluated the efficacy and toxicity of oral topotecan for patients with MDS who had a fair to good performance status. We also studied and previously reported
on the pharmacokinetics of oral topotecan in these
patients and their adherence to an oral chemotherapy regimen.26 When administered as an oral agent on a 5-day
schedule, others have demonstrated that the maximum
tolerable dose of topotecan for patients with solid tumor
was 2.3 mg/m2 given once daily,27 which is similar to the
total doses used on both arms in the current study. We
observed primarily minor responses when patients with
MDS were treated with oral topotecan. These responses
were accompanied by significant toxicities related to the
therapy. Responses were observed more commonly
among patients with CMML or RAEB-T and among
those with normal cytogenetics. The median survival for
all patients who received treatment with oral topotecan on
the current study was 15 months, which is comparable to
the survival of the very similar population of patients that
was randomized to the observation plus supportive care
arm of CALGB study 9221, our randomized study of azacitidine in MDS.14,15 The rate of response to topotecan
did not differ across the IPSS risk groups, but we observed
that OS, as well as the time to AML or death, was significantly shorter in patients who had higher IPSS scores at
study entry.
We did observe responses in 50% of patients with
CMML who were treated on this study. It is worth noting
92

that patients with this diagnosis also had a higher response
rate in the trial reported by Beran et al, who used the combination of topotecan and cytarabine, compared with the
response rates in patients with other categories of MDS.
We also noted a response rate of 47% in patients with
RAEB-T who were treated on the current trial. Thus, this
agent’s greatest activity may be in the more severe or proliferative forms of MDS. However, neither of these subtypes is included among the MDS forms in the current
WHO classification.
Our findings also emphasized the importance of
expert morphology review in MDS trials. Table 1 illustrates that there often was discordance between the local
institutional assessment of MDS subgroups and that
determined after expert central review. In most cases,
more advanced disease because of a higher percentage of
blasts or more extensive dysplasia was noted during the
central review. These discordant interpretations can influence the IPSS score. However, in this case, whether we analyzed the results using only centrally reviewed data, or
only institutional assessments, or both, the clinical outcomes in this study essentially were the same.
The current study demonstrated minimal activity
and troublesome toxicity from oral topotecan for the
treatment of MDS. It is possible that a lower dose of topotecan might have yielded a similar response rate with a
lower rate of toxicity. The use of lower doses of topotecan
may allow the use of this agent in combination with other
active agents for patients with advanced MDS. New therapies with enhanced activity are needed for patients with
MDS.
