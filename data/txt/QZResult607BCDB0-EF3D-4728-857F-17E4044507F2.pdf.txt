Research during the past few years has shown that transcription
factor cyclic AMP response element-binding protein (CREB)
regulates the expression of a repertoire of genes related to cell
survival (4, 5), inflammation (6), and proliferation (7), such as Bcl-2,
Bcl-xL, cyclooxygenase-2, and tumor necrosis factor-a. CREB has
also been shown to involve the carcinogenesis of several types of
cancer. For example, inhibition of CREB-dependent transcriptional
activity using CRE-decoy oligonucleotide caused antiproliferative
effects on cancer cells by inhibiting aromatase expression in breast
adipose tissue (8). Furthermore, studies using ectopic expression of
dominant-repressor CREB (KCREB) showed that in androgendependent prostate cancer cells, dihydrotestosterone stimulation
caused an antiapoptotic effect through the phosphorylation of
CREB (9). CREB was found to be overexpressed in bone marrow
cells from patients with acute lymphoid or myeloid leukemia,
suggesting that CREB is involved in leukemogenesis and that its
overexpression can be a biomarker for leukemia (7, 10–12). Finally,
in human melanoma cells, CREB has been reported to be a
mediator of tumor growth and metastasis, and the expression of
KCREB sensitizes melanoma cells to apoptosis and inhibits their
growth and metastasis (13–17).
Although it is not known whether CREB is directly involved in
lung cancer, several lines of evidence have supported this possibility.
For example, a murine spontaneous lung tumors model induced by
transgenic over expression of insulin-like growth factor-II (IGF-II)
displayed high levels of phosphorylated CREB (p-CREB) in such
tumor tissue, and IGF-II–induced CREB phosphorylation played an
important role in survival of lung cancer cell line (18, 19). NSCLC
cells often overexpress Bcl-xL and Bcl-2 (20), which are regulated by
CREB, and their suppression can result in apoptosis. Moreover, a
recent study exploring the role of neurotransmitter receptor on
tumorigenesis have found that blockade of the receptor suppressed
the growth of lung carcinoma cells by reducing the phosphorylation
of CREB and the expression of CREB-regulated genes, such as c-fos,
c-jun, bcl-2, and cyclin D1 (21). Thereof, we aim to determine
whether constitutively active CREB (p-CREB) is a potential target
for treating NSCLC and whether its inhibition blocks cell
proliferation and induces apoptosis in NSCLC cells.
CREB is an effector for a variety of receptors, such as receptors
for growth factors, hormones, retinoids, cytokines, and prostaglandins. It can be activated via multiple pathways by various
upstream kinases, including protein kinase A (PKA; refs. 22, 23),
PKC (24), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)–activated
protein-2 (25), Akt (26), and CaM KII and IV (27, 28). Ro-31-8220 is
a well-known inhibitor of PKC, and it was also found to inhibit p90
ribosomal S6 kinase (p90Rsk) and mitogen and stress-activated
kinase (Msk; refs. 29, 30). As PKC, Rsk, and Msk are all important
upstream activators of CREB, we surmise that this compound
would in effect inhibit CREB. We use this compound in addition to
other genetic tools to study the effect of CREB on tumor cell
growth and to evaluate the potential of targeting CREB signaling as
a strategy for cancer therapy.

Abstract
Genes regulated by cyclic AMP–response element-binding
protein (CREB) have been reported to suppress apoptosis,
induce cell proliferation, and mediate inflammation and
tumor metastasis. However, it is not clear whether CREB is
critically involved in lung carcinogenesis. We found that non–
small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines exhibited elevated
constitutive activity in CREB, in its immediate upstream
kinases (ribosomal s6 kinase and extracellular signal kinase),
and in the CREB-regulated cell survival proteins Bcl-2 and
Bcl-xL. We hypothesized that constitutively active CREB is
important to lung cancer cell growth and survival and
therefore could be a potential therapeutic target for NSCLC.
Ectopic expression of dominant repressor CREB and transfection with small interfering RNA against CREB suppressed the
growth and survival of NSCLC cells and induced apoptotic cell
death. Furthermore, treating H1734 NSCLC cells with an
inhibitor of the CREB signaling pathway Ro-31-8220 inhibited
CREB activation by blocking the activity of extracellular signal
kinase and ribosomal s6 kinase, arrested the cell cycle at
the G2-M phase, and subsequently induced apoptosis with
the suppression of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL expression. Ro-31-8220
suppressed both the anchorage-dependent and independent
growth of NSCLC cells, but its cytotoxic effect was much less
prominent in normal bronchial epithelial cells. Our results
indicate that active CREB plays an important role in NSCLC
cell growth and survival. Thus, agents that suppress CREB
activation could have potential therapeutic value for NSCLC
treatment. [Cancer Res 2008;68(4):981–8]

Introduction
Despite the availability of assorted standard treatments, such as
surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, or combined regiments, non–
small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains an aggressive lung cancer
associated with a poor patient survival. Hence, there is an
imminent need for better therapies for NSCLC. Recently, the
advent of targeted therapy offers new hope to various subsets of
cancers by targeting specifically the signal transduction involving
carcinogenesis and tumor growth (1–3). Thus, identifying new
molecular targets for treatment and/or prevention of NSCLC is
warranted and urgently needed to improve the control of this
deadly form of lung cancer.

Ro-31-8220 in their normal medium. After different lengths of time, cells
were washed, trypsinized, and fixed in 70% ethanol for 1 h at 20jC. Finally,
cells were washed with PBS and stained with propidium iodide (25 Ag/mL)
in the presence of 1 Ag/mL RNase for 30 min at room temperature. The
distribution of cells in the cell cycle was then analyzed with a FACScalibur
flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson).
Soft agar colony formation assay. Single-cell suspensions of the H1734
and H226 cells were treated with or without different concentrations of
Ro-31-8220 and then mixed with agarose to a final concentration of 0.35%.
Aliquots of 1.5 mL containing 104 cells and 10% FBS were plated in triplicate
in six-well plates over a base layer of 0.7% agarose and allowed to gel. The
number of colonies at >60 Am was counted after 28 days of incubation.
Apoptosis assay. H1734 cells (200,000) were plated in chamber slides;
the next day, they were transfected with plasmids encoding CREBwt,
KCREB, or CREB133 (100 ng DNA per chamber) or with 100 nmol/L siCREB.
The terminal transferase dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay was
performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Promega). Briefly,
48 h after transfection, the cells were fixed in 4% formaldehyde and
permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100. The cells were then incubated with
terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase and fluorescein-dUTP and costained
with DAPI and visualized with an Axioskop 40 fluorescence microscope
(Carl Zeiss). Three random fields were counted for each sample. The images

Materials and Methods
Cell culture. We obtained four human NSCLC cell lines, H1734 (lung
adenocarcinoma), H226 (lung squamous cell carcinoma), A549 (alveolar
lung epithelium cell, poorly differentiated), and H292 (pulmonary
mucoepidermoid carcinoma) from the American Type Culture Collection.
Cells were cultured in RPMI containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS).
Normal human tracheobronchial epithelial (NHTBE) cells (Clonetics), which
were used as the control, were cultured by a three-dimensional organotypic
air-liquid interface method as described previously (31–35). Ro-31-8220
was purchased from Calbiochem and prepared in DMSO.
Western blot analysis. The whole-cell lysate was prepared by lysing
the cells in SDS lysis buffer [250 mmol/L Tris-Cl (pH 6.5), 2% SDS, 4%
h-mercaptoethanol, 0.02% bromophenol blue, 10% glycerol] containing
protease and phosphatase inhibitors. Standard SDS-PAGE and Western
blotting procedures were used to analyze the cell lysate. Blots were probed
with anti-CREB and anti–p-CREB (Ser133; Upstate Biotechnology); anti-Bcl2, anti-Bcl-xL, anti–phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2
(Erk1/2), and anti-Erk1/2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); and anti-Rsk and
anti–phosphorylated Rsk (Cell Signaling Technology). To detect the cleavage
products of apoptosis, blots were probed with anti–poly(ADP-ribose)
polymerase (PARP), anti–caspase-9, and anti–caspase-3 antibodies (New
England Biolabs). Anti-actin antibodies were from Sigma-Aldrich, and the
caspase-3 inhibitor Ac-DEVD-CHO was from Promega.
Electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Isolation of nuclear extracts and
preparation of CRE oligonucleotide probes were conducted as previously
described (36). For supershift analysis, the nuclear extracts from H1734 cells
were incubated with radiolabeled oligonucleotide probes in the presence of
antibodies against CREB or p-CREB for 30 min at 37jC. Unlabeled (cold)
probe and a CRE mutant oligonucleotide 5¶-AGAGATTGCCTGTGGTCAAGAGAGCTAG -3¶ (bold face, mutated bases; Santa Cruz Biotechnology;
100-fold) was used to check the specificity of the probes. The radioactive
bands on the dried gels were visualized and quantitated with PhosphoImager (Molecular Dynamics) using ImageQuant software (Amersham
Biosciences).
Immunocytochemistry for CREB localization. H1734 cells (1  105
cells/mL) were plated on a glass chamber slide (Falcon; BD Biosciences) and
treated the next day for 4 h with Ro-31-8220. The chambers were removed,
and cells were fixed with cold acetone. After a brief washing with PBS, the
slides were blocked with 5% normal goat serum in PBS for 1 h and then
incubated for 4 h with rabbit anti–p-CREB antibody (1:100 dilution). The
slides were washed, incubated with goat anti-rabbit IgG-Alexa 594
(Molecular Probes; 1:100 dilution) for 1 h, and counterstained for nuclei
with 4¶,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, dihydrochloride (DAPI; 50 ng/mL;
Molecular Probes) for 15 min. The slides were mounted, and confocal
images were captured with an Olympus FV500 confocal microscope by
using a Plan Apo 60 oil objective.
Transfection and cytotoxicity assay. H1734 cells (10,000/0.5 mL) were
plated in triplicate in 24-well plates and transfected with plasmid DNA
(50 ng/well) of wild-type CREB (CREBwt), KCREB, and CREB133 using
Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). For RNA interference, H1734 cells were
transfected with a final concentration of 100 nmol/L small interfering RNA
(siRNA) SMARTpool sequences targeting human CREB or nonspecific
control pool (Dharmacon RNA Technologies) using siIMPORTER siRNA
transfection reagent (Upstate Biotechnology). The transfection efficiencies
of the control plasmid were consistently above 80%. After 48 h of expression
of CREBwt, KCREB, CREB133, or siCREB, the cytotoxic effect was
determined with the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (MTT) method as described by the manufacturer (Sigma). The
cytotoxic activity of Ro-31-8220 was also determined on the all four NSCLC
cells and NHTBE cells. Briefly, the cells (2,000 per well) were incubated in
triplicate in 96-well plates in the presence or absence of indicated agent in a
final volume of 0.2 mL for different days at 37jC. Afterwards, we performed
the MTT assay.
Flow cytometric analysis. H1734 cells were synchronized by serum
starvation overnight before exposure to Ro-31-8220 in the presence of 5%
serum. NHTBE cells were grown in air-liquid interface and treated with

activity, we performed an electrophoretic mobility shift assay
(EMSA) with radiolabeled oligonucleotide probes containing
consensus CRE motif (5¶-TGACGTCA-3¶). We found that nuclear
extracts from all four NSCLC cell lines contained higher amount of
CRE-binding proteins than that from NHTBE cells as indicated by
the intensity of the single retarded band (Fig. 1B). The specificity of
the probes was verified with 100-fold excess of unlabeled (cold)
consensus CRE and mutant CRE oligonucleotides (Fig. 1C, lanes 3
and 4) using the nuclear extract from H1734 cells. Further
retention of the radiolabeled band (super shift) by anti-CREB and
anti–p-CREB but not control IgG (Fig. 1C, lanes 2, 5, and 6)
confirmed that the previous single band resulted from the
interaction between CRE oligouncleotide and activated CREB.

CREB signaling is constitutively overactivated in NSCLC
cells compared with NHTBE cells. To compare the constitutive
CREB signaling between tumor and normal cells, we measured the
expression level of CREB and its activation status among different
cell lines under unstimulated normal growth condition. Western
blot analysis showed that both CREB and p-CREB levels were
substantially higher in all four NSCLC cell lines compared with
NHTBE cells (Fig. 1A).

had a more pronounced cytotoxic effect on the NSCLC cells than
on the NHTBE cells. Other than the effect on anchorage-dependent
cell growth, we also examined the effect of Ro-31-8220 on the
anchorage-independent growth of NSCLC cells, which is an
indicator of tumorigenicity, using a soft agar colony formation
assay. Our results showed that Ro-31-8220 significantly inhibits the
colony formation in both H1734 and H226 cells at 2 Amol/L
concentration (Fig. 4C). The effect of Ro-31-8220 on NHTBE cells
was not included for comparison here as the cells cannot form
colony in soft agar (data not shown).
Ro-31-8220 induces G2-M cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in
NSCLC cells. To delineate the mechanism by which Ro-31-8220
inhibit cell growth, we examined the effect of Ro-31-8220 on
the cell cycle of H1734 and NHTBE cells. After 12 h incubation, the
percentage of cells in the G2 phase increased from 13% in the
controls to 29% in the Ro-31-8220–treated H1734 cells, and after
24 h, the percentage of cells in G2 phase increased from 17% in the
controls to 23% in Ro-31-8220–treated cells (Fig. 5A). These results
indicated that Ro-31-8220 induced G2-M arrest in H1734 cells.
However, the percentage of cells in the G2 phase was not increased
by Ro-31-8220 treatment in NHTBE cells (12 h: control 17%, treated
13%; 24 h: control 18%, treated 15%). Noticeably, after 24-h
treatment, the percentage of H1734 cells in sub-G1 phase increased
from 1% to 16%, whereas the percentage of NHTBE cells in sub-G1
phase remained <2%.
As cell cycle arrest is a precursor of apoptosis, we examined the
signature cleavage of apoptosis-related proteins in H1734 cells. In
Ro-31-8220–treated cells, Western blot results showed the cleavage
of a 118-kDa PARP protein into an 87-kDa fragment, a hallmark of
cells undergoing apoptosis, whereas in untreated cells the protein
was not cleaved (Fig. 5B). The Ro-31-8220–induced apoptosis was
further evidenced by a time-dependent activation of caspase-9
(Fig. 5B) as indicated by the cleavage of a 47-kDa band to a 37-kDa
band. Similarly, the blots showed the activation of caspase-3 by

treated with or without Ro-31-8220 for 4 h were fixed and
immunocytochemically stained with anti-p-CREB antibody to
analyze the cellular distribution of p-CREB. Confocal images of
the staining showed that Ro-31-8220 induced the nuclear
disappearance of p-CREB in the H1734 cells (Fig. 2C).
Upstream and downstream components of CREB signaling
are constitutively overactivated in NSCLC cells, and their
activation can be inhibited by Ro-31-8220. Rsk is the major
kinase that directly phosphorylates CREB. Our Western blot analysis
showed that all four NSCLC cell lines exhibited higher basal level of
phosphorylated Rsk relative to the NHTBE cells (Fig. 3A, top).
Incubation of the H1734 cells with Ro-31-8220 (20 Amol/L)
suppressed the phosphorylated Rsk level within 2 h (Fig. 3B,
top); such suppression became noticeable at a concentration of
5 Amol/L for 4 h of treatment of Ro-31-8220 (Fig. 3C, top). Moreover,
Erk1/2, an important upstream kinase for Rsk activation, is also
constitutively overactivated in all four NSCLC cell lines compared
with the NHTBE cells (Fig. 3A, middle). The phosphorylated Erk1/2
level was decreased by Ro-31-8220 treatment within 30 min in
H1734 cells (Fig. 3B, middle); this decrease was detectable at
5 Amol/L of Ro-31-8220 treatment (Fig. 3C, middle).
The cell survival signaling regulated by CREB transcription
factor was also examined. Western blot results showed that all
four NSCLC cell lines constitutively overexpressed Bcl-xL and
Bcl-2 compared with the NHTBE cells (Fig. 3A, bottom). Such
overexpression can be suppressed by Ro-31-8220 treatment in a
time-dependent and dose-dependent fashion (Fig. 3B and C, bottom).
Ro-31-8220 suppresses cell growth and tumorigenicity in
NSCLC cells. The effect of Ro-31-8220 on cell proliferation was
then evaluated with MTT assay. The results showed that Ro-318220 suppressed cell proliferation in all four NSCLC cell lines in a
dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4A). Such suppression on cell
proliferation, however, was significantly less in NHTBE cells
(Fig. 4B). Taken together, these results showed that Ro-31-8220

A, whole-cell lysates from NSCLC cell lines (H1734, H226, H292, and A549) and NHTBE cells were analyzed with Western blot for the levels of phosphorylated

indicated times or with various concentrations of Ro-31-8220 for 4 h, and the whole-cell lysate was assessed for the levels of signaling components mentioned
above. Equal sample loading is indicated by the band intensity of the inactive form of each protein or h-actin (bottom of each figure).

knockdown of CREB and the ectopic expression of KCREB and
CREB133 were confirmed by Western blot analysis (Fig. 6C, top).
Next, we examined whether such genetic quenching of constitutive CREB activity induced apoptosis. We found that
suppression of CREB activity induced cleavage of both PARP
and caspase 3 as did in Ro-31-8220 treatment (Fig. 6C). To
confirm the effect of suppression of CREB activity on apoptosis,
we performed a TUNEL assay. As expected, suppression of
constitutive CREB activity caused a significant increase in the
percentage of TUNEL-positive cells in H1734 cells — 44% for
CREB-siRNA, 35% for KCREB, and 39% for CREB133, respectively
— compared with controls (6% for CREBwt and 8% for nonspecific siRNA; Fig. 6D). Meanwhile, treatment with 5 Amol/L
Ro-31-8220 for 48 h induced apoptosis in 52% of the cells. These
data suggest that the depletion of CREB in the H1734 cells
sensitized the cells to apoptosis.

Ro-31-8220 (Fig. 5C, lane 3) through the cleavage of a 37-kDa band
to a 16-kDa band. These findings show that Ro-31-8220 induced
apoptosis in the H1734 cells. To determine whether caspase
activation is required for Ro-31-8220–induced suppression of cell
growth, we used a caspase-3 inhibitor, Ac-DEVD-CHO, to block
caspase activation. The effectiveness of Ac-DEVD-CHO in blocking
the Ro-31-8220–induced caspase-3 cleavages was confirmed on
Fig. 5C. H1734 cells were then treated with Ro-31-8220 in the
presence of different concentrations of Ac-DEVD-CHO, and cell
viability was assessed with MTT assay. The caspase-3 inhibitor
effectively protected the cells from Ro-31-8220 induced cytotoxicity
at a concentration as low as 0.01 Amol/L (Fig. 5D). These results
suggest that caspase-3 activation is essential for Ro-31-8220
induced cytotoxicity.
Suppression of CREB expression and activation inhibits
cell proliferation and induces apoptosis in NSCLC cells. We
have shown that Ro-31-8220 inhibited constitutively active CREB,
suppressed cell proliferation, and induced apoptosis. To test
whether the inhibition of constitutively active CREB is accountable for the antitumorigenesis effect of Ro-31-8220, we suppressed the constitutive CREB activity in H1734 cells by
knockdown of CREB expression with RNA interference or by
repressing the CREB transcriptional activity with the transfection
of KCREB and CREB133 and observed the effect on cell proliferation. Our results showed that suppression of constitutively
active CREB by all three methods inhibited cell growth (Fig. 6A
and B). In contrast, transfection with CREB wild-type or
nontarget siRNA did not affect cell growth. The efficient siRNA

Discussion
CREB is an important transcription factor that involves
numerous physiologic processes, including differentiation of
bronchial epithelial cells (36, 37). Aside from the physiologic
importance, the role of CREB in tumorigenicity has also been
indicated lately (see Introduction). In the present study, we found
that CREB is overexpressed and constitutively active in several
human NSCLC cell lines. Moreover, we found that direct and/or
indirect suppression of constitutively active CREB inhibits cell
proliferation and induces apoptosis in NSCLC cells.

Several different upstream pathways have been known to lead to
CREB activation. Among them, PKC pathway has been shown to
induce CREB activation via a MAPK cascade (36, 37). Based on the
inhibitory effect of Ro-31-8220 on several components along the
PKC-CREB pathway, we used this compound to suppress CREB
activation and found that Ro-31-8220 effectively inhibited the CREB
activity (Fig. 2) and the growth of all four NSCLC cell lines we
tested (Fig. 4A). Furthermore, the upstream and downstream
signaling of CREB, including the phosphorylation of Erk and Rsk
and the expression of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, are also effectively
suppressed (Fig. 3B and C). These results not only showed the
importance of CREB but also indicated that CREB may be
constitutively activated by the PKC branch of its upstream pathway
in the NSCLC cells. This assumption is further supported by the
observation that the activity of two signaling components in the
PKC-CREB pathway, ERK1/2 and RSK, are also markedly higher in
the four tumor cell lines compared with normal cells (Fig. 3A). Our

results agree with the report that phosphorylated Rsk and
phosphorylated Erk1/2 are involved in the CREB activation (38,
39) and our own studies that PKC is involved in CREB signaling
pathway (36).
As mentioned earlier, CREB plays a pivotal role in cellular
signaling, and several upstream signaling pathways converge on
CREB (40). Therefore, regardless the upstream pathways, CREB
seems to be the most effective target for inhibiting the CREBassociated tumor cell growth. In addition, the expression of
CREB gene can be up-regulated by the activation of CREB per se
(41). Such an effect might account for the higher level of CREB
observed in the NSCLC cells (Fig. 1A) and would also make the
CREB level more effectually modulated. Other than the strategic
advantage, the most compelling rationale for CREB targeting is
the mechanism by which CREB supports tumor cell growth. We
found that the expression of the CREB-regulated antiapoptotic
proteins, Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, is significantly higher in NSCLC cells

Figure 5. Ro-31-8220 leads to G2-M cell cycle arrest followed by apoptosis in NSCLC cells. A, serum starvation–synchronized H1734 cells and NHTBE cells
were incubated in the absence or presence of 10 Amol/L Ro-31-8220 for the indicated times. Then, cells were washed, fixed, stained with propidium iodide, and
analyzed for DNA content by flow cytometry. Data (means F SE) shown are percentages of cells in each phase of cell cycle from three experiments. *, P < 0.05;
**, P < 0.01 (one-tailed, t test). B, H1734 cells were incubated with or without 20 Amol/L Ro-31-8220 for the indicated times in medium containing 5% of serum.
Whole-cell lysates were subjected to Western blot analysis using anti-PARP, anti–caspase-9 antibodies. C, suppression of Ro-31-8220 induced caspase-3 cleavage by
caspase-3 inhibitor. H1734 cells were preincubated with and without caspase inhibitor, 5 Amol/L Ac-DEVD-CHO for 2 h, and then treated with 20 Amol/L Ro-31-8220
for 24 h. Then, cell extracts were prepared and analyzed for caspase-3 cleavage by Western blot analysis using an anti-caspase-3 antibody. DMSO was used as
a vehicle control. D, the caspase-3 inhibitor protects cells from Ro-31-8220–induced cytotoxicity. H1734 cells were incubated with different concentrations of caspase
inhibitor Ac-DEVD-CHO as indicated for 2 h and then treated with 20 Amol/L Ro-31-8220. After 24 h, cell viability was determined by the MTT. Columns, means
percentage viability from triplicate cultures of three independent experiments; bars, SE. **, P < 0.01.

CREB in Lung Cancer Cell Growth and Survival

Figure 6. Suppression of CREB inhibits cell proliferation and induces apoptosis. A, H1734 cells were transfected with CREBwt, KCREB, and CREB133 plasmid
and then assayed for cell proliferation by the MTT assays. Points, means of three independent experiments; bars, SE. B, H1734 cells were transfected with siCREB
and nonspecific control pool siRNA (NS-siRNA), then assayed for cell proliferation by the MTT assays. Points, means of three independent experiments; bars, SE.
C, H1734 cells were transiently transfected with siCREB, siRNA-NS, CREBwt, KCREB, and CREB133 plasmid. Three days after transfection, equal amounts of
whole-cell lysates were prepared and subjected to Western blot analysis using the indicated antibodies. D, TUNEL analysis was performed on H1734 cells 48 h after
transfection with the indicated siRNA, plasmids, or treatment with Ro-31-8220 (5 Amol/L). Lower panel, nuclei (DAPI stain); upper panel, TUNEL-positive nuclei.

distinctively higher in tumor tissues relative to the adjacent normal
tissues and that such overexpression is inversely correlated with
the survival duration of a subset of NSCLC patients.1 Our results
indicate that NSCLC cells are highly dependent on the elevated
CREB activity for their survival and cell growth and inhibition of
CREB effectively suppress the growth of NSCLC cells. Taken
together, over-activation of CREB confers a CREB-dependent
survival and cell growth on NSCLC cells. Such dependence on the
excessive CREB activity furnishes an extended therapeutic window
for targeting CREB as a strategy for treating NSCLC tumors.

compared with NHTBE cells (Fig. 3A), and such overexpression can
be effectively suppressed by blocking the CREB signaling (Fig. 3B
and C). Our findings agree with other reports that Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL
are regulated by CREB (42). Moreover, the inhibition of CREB
activity either by knockdown of CREB expression level with siCREB
or expression of dominant-negative form of CREB mutants (KCREB
and CREB133) induced apoptosis in NSCLC cells. We verified this
apoptotic effect with various assays, including flow cytometry
analysis, the signature cleavage of PARP and caspases, and TUNEL
assay (Figs. 5 and 6). The rescue of such cell death by a caspase
inhibitor, Ac-DEVD-CHO, affirmed that the major cause of cell
death is apoptosis (Fig. 5C and D). Other studies have shown that
the expression of KCREB decreases the tumorigenicity and tumor
metastatic potential in nude mice (15, 16, 43), reduces the resistance
of human melanoma cells to radiation (13), and reduces adipogenesis (44). In addition, the ability of forming colony in soft agar,
a measure of aggressive cell growth, was clearly inhibited in NSCLC
cells at a lower concentration of Ro-31-8220 (Fig. 4C). Conversely,
NHTBE cells are not as susceptible as NSCLC cells to the cell death
induced by the inhibition of CREB (Fig. 4B).
Concomitantly, we have observed in archived lung tumor
specimens that the expression levels of CREB and p-CREB are
