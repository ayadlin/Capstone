ABSTRACT
The prognosis of metastatic osteosarcoma is dismal and a better understanding
of the mechanisms underlying disease progression is essential to improve treatment
options and patient outcomes. We previously demonstrated Pla2g16 overexpression in
mouse osteosarcoma contributes to metastasis phenotypes and increased expression
of PLA2G16 is associated with metastasis and poor prognosis in human tumors. To
further examine the mechanisms through which PLA2G16 contributes to human
osteosarcoma metastasis and explore the potential of PLA2G16 as a therapeutic
target in osteosarcoma, we generated a panel of human osteosarcoma cell lines
expressing different levels of PLA2G16. The functional analyses of these cell lines
demonstrated high levels of PLA2G16 expression increased osteosarcoma cell
migration, invasion, clonogenic survival, and anchorage-independent colony
formation. Importantly, this activity was dependent on the phospholipase activity
of PLA2G16. Additionally, PLA2G16 overexpression decreased the sensitivity of cells
to a panel of chemotherapeutic agents. Analysis of downstream pathways revealed
the pro-metastasis functions of PLA2G16 were mediated through the MAPK pathway,
as knockdown of PLA2G16 decreased ERK1/2 phosphorylation and pharmacological
inhibition of MEK significantly repressed PLA2G16 mediated cell migration and
clonogenic survival. Furthermore, PLA2G16 overexpression promoted xenograft
tumor growth in vivo, and these tumors exhibit increased ERK1/2 phosphorylation.
Lastly, the expression of PLA2G16 is strongly correlated with the increased ERK1/2
phosphorylation in human osteosarcoma samples, and the combined lesions are
associated with reduced overall and metastasis-free survival. Collectively, these
results demonstrate increased PLA2G16 expression activates the MAPK pathway to
enhance osteosarcoma metastasis and may be a novel therapeutic target for these
cancers.

INTRODUCTION

Additionally, osteosarcoma is associated with a high
propensity for lung metastasis and clinical analysis shows
that a 5-year survival rate for patients with metastatic
osteosarcoma is only 10% to 20% [3, 6]. Thus, it is highly
desirable to identify novel biomarkers and therapeutic
targets to help evaluate and treat osteosarcoma patients.
There is conflicting evidence in the literature about
the functional contributions of PLA2G16 (also referred to
as H-REV-107, HRASLS3 and AdPLA2) to tumorigenesis

Osteosarcoma is the most common primary
malignant bone tumor in children, young adult and
adolescents [1–3], and commonly arises in the femur
(42%), the tibia (19%) and the humerus (10%) [4]. Despite
newly-developed multi-agent chemotherapy and gradually
improved surgical techniques, the overall survival rate
since 1970s remains only approximately 60%
[5].

[7, 8]. PLA2G16 is reported to suppress HRAS induced
transformation, and inhibit cell proliferation, colony
formation, and promote apoptosis, and was considered as
a tumor suppressor before its phospholipase activity was
discovered [7, 9–11]. Interestingly, as a phospholipase,
PLA2G16 generates lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) and
free fatty acid (FFA) from phosphatidic acid [12, 13].
LPA is a critical signal transduction molecule and
metabolism regulator that promotes tumor progression
by modulating cytoskeletal changes, cell-cell contacts,
cell survival, proliferation, invasion and metastasis
through activating multiple signal pathways, such as
HRAS, MAPK, RAC, RHO, PLC, AKT and Hippo-YAP
pathways [14–20]. Moreover, FFAs including the
arachidonic acid and other unsaturated fatty acids, which
contributes to the production of prostaglandin Es, can also
play an important role in cancer pathogenesis [12, 21].
PLA2G16 null mice are resistant to high fat diet or leptin
deficiency induced obesity through the PGE2-EP3-cAMP
pathway [8], suggesting PLA2G16 may contribute to
tumor progression through altered metabolic pathways.
Additionally, PLA2G16 is also reported to suppress
protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) activity in ovarian
carcinoma cells [22]. Yet PP2A is a well-known tumor
suppressor and often genetically mutated or inactivated
in many leukemia and solid cancers [23–26] . Therefore
PLA2G16 may have oncogenic roles in some human
tumors. Moreover, high level of the PLA2G16 protein
expression in the cytoplasm increased proliferation of a
subset of non-small cell lung carcinomas, thus contributed
to tumor progression and poor prognosis [27]. Notably,
we previously demonstrated that expression of Pla2g16
induced by mutant p53 in mouse osteosarcoma cells
contributes to the increased metastatic features [28].
Importantly, PLA2G16 expression is associated with
poor prognosis and metastasis in human osteosarcoma
regardless of p53 status [29], which strongly supports
that PLA2G16 play an important role in osteosarcoma
progression and metastasis, yet the downstream pathways
which mediate the oncogenic function of PLA2G16 in
human osteosarcoma remain unknown.
In addition, phospholipases are implicated in
chemo resistance. Etoposide-induced cleavage of
phospholipase C-γ1 represses apoptosis and contributes
to chemo resistance in T leukaemia cells [30]. More
closely, inhibition of phospholipase A2 activity leads to
less apoptosis and chemo resistance in non-small cell lung
cancer (NSCLC) [31]. The effect of PLA2G16 on drug
sensitivity in human osteosarcoma remain unknown.
In this study, several human osteosarcoma cells
with varying levels of PLA2G16 were used to assess
the effect of PLA2G16 expression on proliferation,
clonogenic survival, anchorage-independent colony
growth, invasion, migration and drug sensitivity.
Additionally, Saos2 cells with PLA2G16 overexpression
were injected subcutaneously in nude mice to determine
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

the tumorigenic potential of PLA2G16 overexpressing
cells. Furthermore, we also investigated the pathways
downstream of PLA2G16. Our data reveal that the
oncogenic activity of PLA2G16 is mediated in large part
through the activation of the MAPK pathway. Thus, this
study establishes PLA2G16 as a therapeutic candidate for
metastatic osteosarcoma in patients.

RESULTS
PLA2G16 promotes osteosarcoma cell
proliferation, colony formation, migration and
invasion
Our previous work indicated that Pla2g16 can
promote tumor progression and metastasis in mouse
osteosarcoma cells [28]. Additionally, we demonstrated
that increased PLA2G16 expression in osteosarcoma is
associated with metastasis and poorer survival [29]. Thus,
to further examine what metastatic properties can be
induced by PLA2G16 overexpression and investigate the
underlying mechanisms, we engineered overexpression
and knockdown models of PLA2G16 in human
osteosarcoma cell lines. We first examined the endogenous
expression level of PLA2G16 in Saos2, MG63, and HOS
cells. In comparison to Saos2 and MG63, HOS cells
showed higher mRNA and protein expression of PLA2G16
by both the real time quantitative PCR and western blot
analyses respectively (Figure 1A). We then generated
Saos2 and MG63 cell lines with stable overexpression
PLA2G16 (WT) or PLA2G16-C113 (MUT). The C113
mutation has a loss of lipase function mutation at amino
acid 113 and is used to determine if the lipase activity
is required [12, 13]. PLA2G16 and PLA2G16-C113
expression were significantly increased at both the mRNA
and protein levels in Saos2 and MG63 cells (Figure 1B).
MTT assays were performed to determine the effect
of PLA2G16 overexpression to cell proliferation.
These results indicate that PLA2G16 overexpression
significantly enhances cell proliferation in both cell lines
when compared to both empty vector control (CTL) and
the lipase-deficient mutant PLA2G16-C113 (Figure 1C).
Moreover, low-density colony formation assays clearly
demonstrate that PLA2G16 overexpression increases the
clonogenic survival of cells (Figures 1D and S1A). In
addition, we also carried out a soft agar colony formation
assay to examine the effect of PLA2G16 overexpression
on anchorage-independent cell growth. Overexpression
of PLA2G16 caused a significant increase in both the
number and size of the colonies in Saos2 and MG63 cells
while overexpression of PLA2G16-C113 had no effect
(Figures 1E and S1B). Additionally cell migration and
invasion were evaluated by wound-healing and Matrigel
transwell assays, respectively. Saos2 and MG63 cells with
PLA2G16 overexpression showed a significant increase
in migration (Figure 2A) and invasion (Figure 2B),
18022

Oncotarget

while overexpressing of PLA2G16-C113 had no effect
(Figures 2A, 2B, S2). Notably, as the proliferation of
PLA2G16 overexpressing cells did not show significant
difference during the first 48 hours (Figure 1C), and
the cells were incubated with medium without FBS
in the migration and invasion assays, it is unlikely that
proliferation rates influenced migration and invasion.
Combined these data strongly support that PLA2G16
overexpression contributes to human osteosarcoma
progression and metastasis, and this activity is dependent
on the lipase activity.
We previously demonstrated that knockdown of
PLA2G16 in LM7 cells resulted in a clear reduction in
migration and invasion [28]. LM7 are a subline of Saos2
cells that were enriched for their metastatic potential
through tail vein injections in nude mice, and subsequently
isolated from the tumor that formed in the lung. To further
examine the role of PLA2G16 in osteosarcoma in a more
relevant human cell line, we knocked down PLA2G16
expression in HOS cell line (Figure 1A). Similar to LM7
cells, two shRNAs were used to knock down PLA2G16

in HOS cells, resulting in more than 90% reduction by
both qRT-PCR and western blot analyses when compared
to the EGFP knockdown control cells (Figure 3A). MTT
analysis showed that knockdown of PLA2G16 decreased
HOS cell proliferation (Figure 3B). Clonogenic survival
and soft agar colony formation were significantly
repressed with PLA2G16 knockdown (Figures 3C,
3D, S3A, and S3B). Interestingly, the colony size from
knockdown cells were also smaller in soft agar experiments
(Figure S3B). Similarly, PLA2G16 knockdown in HOS
cells resulted in decreased migration and invasion
(Figures 3E, 3F and S3C). Therefore these data demonstrate
that high levels of PLA2G16 expression increases multiple
metastatic properties in osteosarcoma cells and it may be a
novel therapeutic target for osteosarcoma.

PLA2G16 reduces sensitivity to chemotherapy in
osteosarcoma cells
One of the reasons for the poor prognosis of
osteosarcoma is the development of drug resistance.

Since overexpression of PLA2G16 is implicated in cell
survival and phospholipases are reported to increase
chemo resistance, we next evaluated the effect of
PLA2G16 overexpression on sensitivity to a panel of
chemotherapeutics, including doxorubicin (DOX),
cisplatin (CDDP) and etoposide (ETP). Saos2 and
MG63 cells that stably expressing PLA2G16 (WT),
PLA2G16-C113 (MUT) or the control vector (CTL)
were incubated with different concentrations of
DOX and CDDP for 48 hours respectively, and cell
viability was determined by MTT assay. PLA2G16
overexpressing cells were less sensitive to DOX,
CDDP and ETP than CTL group and MUT group in
a dose-dependent manner (Figure 4A, 4B and 4C).

In addition, cells were also incubated with drugs for
different times and cells overexpressing PLA2G16 showed
decreased sensitivity to DOX, CDDP and ETP in a timedependent manner in both cell lines (Figure 4D, 4E and 4F).
Similarly, we also assessed whether PLA2G16 knockdown
could affect HOS cell drug sensitivity. The shRNA
expressing HOS cells showed higher sensitivity to
anticancer drug DOX, CDDP and ETP in a time- and dosedependent manner (Figure 5A, 5B, 5C, 5D, 5E and 5F).
Thus, the above results demonstrated that PLA2G16
expression may contribute to chemotherapy resistance,
and it can be a potential target for the combination therapy
using lipase inhibitors together with classic anticancer
drugs in osteosarcoma patients.

The oncogenic function of PLA2G16 is
associated with cytoplasmic localization and is
partially mediated through increased MAPK
signaling in osteosarcoma cells

whereas a cytoplasmic localized PLA2G12 has oncogenic
effects [27]. Therefore, we extracted the cytoplasm and
nuclear fractions from Saos2 and HOS cell respectively
to determine localization of PLA2G16. Interestingly,
we found that PLA2G16 was largely cytoplasmic and
associated with higher phosphorylation of ERK1/2
(Figure 6D), consistently with the study in NSCLC [27].
To determine the functional relevance of MAPK
pathway activation mediated by PLA2G16 expression in
osteosarcoma progression, we used U0126 monoethanolate
(a MEK specific inhibitor) to inhibit the phosphorylation
of ERK1/2 (Figure 7A) and examined the clonogenic
survival and migration abilities in Saos2 and MG63 cells.
The low-density colony formation assays showed that
the colongenicity induced by PLA2G16 overexpression
was specifically inhibited by U0126 both in Saos2 (from
2.15 fold induction reduced to 1.70 fold under 10 μM
and 1.60 under 20 μM) and MG63 cells (from 1.64 fold
induction reduced to 1.06 fold under 5μM and 1.19
fold under 10 μM) (Figure 7B and Figure S5A).
Wound-healing assays showed migration was similar
among PLA2G16 (WT), PLA2G16-C113 (MUT) or
the control vector (CTL) cell lines in the presence of
U0126 (Figure 7C and Figure S5B ), indicating U0126

It is well known that phospholipases modulate
multiple downstream pathways in cancer cells [32]. To
identify the pathways through which PLA2G16 increased
the oncogenic phenotype of osteosarcoma cell we tested
the activities of several candidate downstream pathways
by western blot analyses. PLA2G16 overexpression
clearly increased the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 both at
the normal culture condition (Figure 6A) and fetal bovine
serum stimulation after overnight starvation (Figure 6B)
in both Saos2 and MG63 cells, suggesting activation
of the MAPK pathway is downstream of PLA2G16.
Consistently, ERK1/2 phosphorylation was markedly
decreased not only in PLA2G16 knockdown HOS cells
(Figure 6C) but also in LM7 cells (Figure 4S).
Previously, the function of PLA2G16 in tumor
development was reported to be associated with its
intracellular localization. Nuclear localized PLA2G16
has been shown to have tumor suppressive activity

also specifically inhibited the migration induced by
PLA2G16 overexpression. Thus, our data demonstrated
that PLA2G16 may function as an oncogene in part by
activating MAPK pathway.

PLA2G16 expression is associated with ERK1/2
phosphorylation in osteosarcoma patients and
predicts for poor overall and metastasis-free
survival

PLA2G16 contributes tumorigenesis in vivo

To examine the relevance of the PLA2G16 and
ERK1/2 phosphorylation in primary patient samples,
an osteosarcoma tissue array was generated including
thirty-five (39.8%) female and 53 (60.2%) male patients
with histologically confirmed osteosarcoma. The median
age of the patients was 19 years, with an age range from
1 to 72 years at the time of surgery. At the end of the last
follow up, 41 patients died, primarily due to metastases
(30/41, 73%). The clinical and histopathologic details
of the 88 cases are listed in Tables 1 and 2. Positive
staining of PLA2G16 and p-ERK1/2 are mainly present
on the cytoplasm of the tumor cells (Figure 9A), which is
consistent with the western blot analyses from PLA2G16
overexpression cells (Figure 6D). To elucidate the
biologic significance, we investigated the association of
clinicopathologic features and PLA2G16 and p-ERK1/2
expression levels. As shown in Table 1, PLA2G16
and p-ERK1/2 were associated with lung metastasis
(both P < 0.05), but not with gender, age at diagnosis, tumor

To determine the effect of PLA2G16 overexpression
in osteosarcoma cells in vivo, we injected our Saos2 cell
line panel subcutaneously into Balb/c nude mice. After
tumors were visible (about 2 week after injection), the
length and width were measured and the volume was
calculated every 3 days. Only three out of five mice
developed tumors from the control group, and the mice
injected with PLA2G16-C113 mutant expressing cells did
not develop tumors (3 out of 3), All five mice injected
with PLA2G16 overexpressing cells developed tumors
(Figure 8A). The tumors grew much faster in the mice
with PLA2G16 overexpressing cells (Figure 8B), and
the average tumor volumes were significantly larger than
the CTL group (Figure 8A, 8C). Western blots performed
from tumor lysates showed that PLA2G16 overexpression
group (WT) is associated higher ERK1/2 phosphorylation
(Figure 8D), further supporting that activation of ERK1/2
phosphorylation in tumors is downstream of PLA2G16.

P = 0.016) (Figure 9D). The 5-year OS (61.5%) and MFS
(54.1%) rates for the group of PLA2G16-p-ERK1/2+ or
PLA2G16+p-ERK1/2- dropped dramatically (Table 2,
both P < 0.05 and Figure 9D), yet 5-year OS (51.1%)
and MFS (44.7%) rates in the group for double positive
for PLA2G16 and p-ERK1/2 were further decreased
(Figure 9D), indicating that PLA2G16 high expression
and p-ERK1/2 may be additive effect for prognosis.
To determine the predictive power of PLA2G16 and
p-ERK1/2 protein expression for metastasis, we calculated
the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve
(ROC) for the following three prognostic models (Table 4):
PLA2G16 expression (+ vs.−), p-ERK1/2 expression
(+ vs. −), PLA2G16 combined with p-ERK1/2 expression
(both + vs. others). In the present study, PLA2G16 and
p-ERK1/2 positive rates (75.8% vs 41.8%, P = 0.002;
81.8% vs 54.5%, P = 0.010; respectively; Table 1) in
patients with lung metastasis were significantly higher than
those non-metastatic ones. Both PLA2G16 and p-ERK1/2
could be potential biomarkers for predictive osteosarcoma
lung metastasis and yielded an area under the ROC curve
(AUC) of 0.670 and 0.636, respectively. Combined ROC
analyses revealed an AUC of 0.706, indicating the additive
effect in the predictive value of both genes (Table 4).
These data strongly support that PLA2G16 contributes
osteosarcoma metastasis and it may be mediated through
MAPK pathway activation in patients.

location or histological classification (P > 0.05). The 3-and
5-year OS and MFS rates were 75.0% and 62.6%, 65.5%
and 57.7%, respectively, for the entire study population.
PLA2G16 was an independent prognostic factor for
OS and MFS again for this study group (Figure 9B).
The PLA2G16 positive group had significantly lower
5-year OS (55.1% vs 71.7%; P = 0.05) and MFS rates
(47.9% vs 69.4%; P = 0.036) than that of the remaining
cases, respectively (Table 2). Interestingly, p-ERK1/2 was
also a prognostic factor for both OS and MFS (Figure 9C).
The p-ERK1/2 negative group had significantly greater
5-year OS (80.5% vs 53.0%, P = 0.009) and MFS (76.8%
vs 46.9%, P = 0.011) rates than those of the p-ERK1/2
positive group. PLA2G16 and p-ERK1/2 expression
was positive in 48 (54.5%) and 57 (64.8%) cases,
respectively. There was a significant correlation between
the expression of PLA2G16 and p-ERK1/2 (P = 0.002) in
these osteosarcoma samples (Table 3). Furthermore, when
PLA2G16 and p-ERK1/2 expression were both taken into
consideration, 21 patients (23.9%) were both PLA2G16
(PLA2G16-) and p-ERK1/2 negative (p-ERK1/2- ), and
38 patients (43.2%) were PLA2G16 (PLA2G16+) and
p-ERK1/2 positive (p-ERK1/2+) simultaneously. There
were 29 cases (32.9%) either PLA2G16+ or p-ERK1/2+
positive. The prognosis of PLA2G16 and p-ERK1/2
double negative group was the best with 5-year OS
and MFS at 85.4% and 85.7%, respectively; P = 0.020,

directly or indirectly regulated by LPA and FFA in tumors.
Taken together, these results suggest that PLA2G16 has
different roles in different cell contexts. Our studies
indicate that PLA2G16 overexpression is associated
with osteosarcoma progression and can be a potential
biomarker to predict osteosarcoma lung metastasis
[28, 29]. Herein we further demonstrate that PLA2G16
expression promotes migration, invasion, clonogenic
survival, and anchorage independent growth of human
osteosarcoma cell lines. Mechanistically we show that
PLA2G16 actives the MAPK pathway to promote tumor
progression in vitro and in vivo. Additionally, analysis of a
human osteosarcoma tissue microarray indicates a strong
correlation between PLA2G16 expression and activation
of the MAPK pathway. An additive effect of PLA2G16

PLA2G16 was originally called a class II tumor
suppressor based on studies that demonstrated an
inhibitory role on HRAS. Recent recent studies have
demonstrated that HRAS expression is sometimes a
good prognostic factor in various cancer types, including
breast cancer and neuroblastoma at the early stage [33,
34]. Thus, the inhibitory role of PLA2G16 on HRAS in
tumor progression and metastasis is very likely dependent
on the tumor types and tumor stages [35]. PLA2G16 can
also inhibit well-known tumor suppressor PP2A activity,
suggesting that PLA2G16 may have oncogenic activity in
some tumors. Additionally, PLA2G16 is now known to
produce LPA and FFA, and multiple signal pathways are

expression and ERK1/2 phosphorylation is also shown
to predict patient survival and metastasis. Thus, our
data strongly support an oncogenic role for PLA2G16 in
promoting osteosarcoma progression and metastasis.
We also demonstrate that PLA2G16 overexpression
reduced sensitivity to chemotherapeutic drugs in both
a dose and time-dependent manner, suggesting the
development of small molecular inhibitors against
PLA2G16 could be used to increase the sensitivity of
osteosarcoma standard chemotherapy. The mechanisms of
PLA2G16 activity in altered drug sensitivity is still need
to be investigated in the future.
The main cause of mortality in osteosarcoma
patients is metastasis. Patients with localized tumors
have a 5-year survival rate in the range of 60% to 80%.

In contrast, patients with metastasis have a 5-year
survival rate between 15% to 30% [1, 36]. Additionally,
osteosarcoma is generally characterized by highly
complex karyotypes and unknown origin [37]. Thus, it has
been difficult to identify osteosarcoma-specific therapeutic
targets. Based on the data in this study, we believe that
PLA2G16 is a good therapeutic target for osteosarcoma
patients. Additionally, the overexpression of a mutant
PLA2G16 construct in osteosarcoma cells appears to have
dominant-negative activity over the wild-type enzyme as
the endogenous levels of p-Erk are reduced (Figure 6) and
the xenograft model also shows reduced tumor growth in
cells expressing the mutant PLA2G16 compared to empty
vector controls (Figure 8B, 8C). These data further suggest
that an inhibitor against PLA2G16 may have profound

It will be interesting to examine the effect of inhibition

used. PLA2G16 gene-specific primers were previously
described [28]. GAPDH genes was used as internal
control.
Cells were lysed with RIPA lysis buffer and
protein were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to
PVDF membrane. The antibodies including vinculin
(Santa Cruz, CA), pAkt, Akt, p-Erk, Erk, p-mTOR, m-TOR
(Cell Signaling Technology, MA) were incubated at the
dilution specified by manufacturer at 4°C overnight.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Cell proliferation with or without anticancer
drugs

Cell lines and culture

Cell proliferation was assessed by 3-(4, 5-dimethyl2-thiazolyl)-2, 5- diphenyl- 2-H-tetrazolium bromide
(MTT) assay. All stable cell lines were seeded into
96-well plates at 1 × 103/well. For cell proliferation assay,
0.5 mg/ml MTT solution was added to each well for
four hours and measured at the absorbance of 570 nm by
multifunctional micro plate reader.

Osteosarcoma cells (Saos2, MG63 and HOS) were
obtained from China Infrastructure of Cell Line Resource
and cultured in DMEM medium with 10% fetal bovine
serum and 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 U/ml streptomycin.
Retrovirus or lentivirus were produced using 293T
cells and were collected twice between 36 h and 72 h to
infect osteosarcoma cells followed by manufacturer’s
instructions. After infection, cells were selected by
puromycin for 2 weeks and the expression level of
PLA2G16 was confirmed by qRT-PCR and western blot.

Colony formation (clonogenicity) and soft agar
assays
Stable transfected cells were seeded in triplicate
into 6-well plates. Culture medium was changed every
3 days and cells were grown for 10–14 days until colonies
were formed. Colonies were fixed with paraformaldehyde
and stained with crystal violet for 15 minutes at room
temperature. Colonies that contained more than 50 cells
were counted.
The anchorage-independent growth was determined
by soft agar colony formation assay. Cells (1 × 103) were

Quantitative RT-PCR analysis and western blots
Total mRNA was extracted with Trizol reagent
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). RNA was reverse
transcribed to cDNA with FastQuant RT Kit (with
gDNase) (Tiangen Biotech, China) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. For quantitative RT-PCR
system, SYBR Premix Taq (Tiangen Biotech, China) was

suspended in 1 ml of 0.35% agar supplemented with 10%
FBS and DMEM medium and plated on a 0.7% agar
coated 6-well plate. The plates were incubated for 2–3
weeks and then stained with 0.005% crystal violet and the
number of colonies were counted.

Correlations between different immunoreactivity
and clinical variables were assessed using Pearson’s chisquared test or Fisher’s exact test. The prognostic effects
of PLA2G16 and p-ERK1/2 were evaluated using the
Kaplan–Meier method and compared using the log-rank
test. The Spearman rank test was applied to demonstrate
correlations. Receiver-operating characteristics (ROC)
curves were established to evaluate the predictive value
of PLA2G16 and p-ERK1/2 expression for metastasis
from primary osteosarcoma, a larger area under the ROC
corresponded to greater prognostic potential for a specific
factor. Overall survival (OS) was defined as the interval
between date of diagnosis and death or the last observation.
For the metastasis free survival (MFS) analysis, the
duration was defined as the time from diagnosis until the
occurrence of metastasis or the last follow up. If these
patients had metastatic disease at diagnosis, the event
was considered time 0. For all the analyses, a two-sided
P value ≤ 0.05 was considered statistically significant. All
statistical analyses were performed using the SPSS for
windows, version 18.0 (SPSS, Inc, Chicago, IL).

Migration and invasion assay
Cell migration was determined by wound-healing
assay. Cancer cells were seeded at a concentration of
3 × 105 cells/ml into the plates with a culture insert (Inbidi,
Madison, Wisconsin) to form a gap of 500 μm according
to the manufacturer’s instruction. After removing the
insert, cells that migrated into the wound area were
photographed by inverted microscope. The wound closure
width is calculated as following: (12– to 72-hour width/
0–hourwidth)*100%.
Matrigel Transwells (BD Biosciences, NJ) were
used for in vitro invasion assay. Briefly, the insert standing
in 24-well culture plate were coated with 50 ul Matrigel
in serum-free DMEM medium and dried overnight.
1 × 105 cells in 100 μl serum-free medium were added to
the insert. The lower chamber was added 500 μl DMEM
medium containing 10% FBS. Cells were incubated for
36 hours and the cells that penetrated the membrane were
counted after fixing with the 4% paraformaldehyde and
staining with 1% crystal violet.

Animal experiments
Four-week-old male nude mice (Balb/c, nu/nu; SPF
laboratory animal center of Dalian Medical University,
Dalian, China) were housed under pathogen-free
condition. All animal experiments were approved by the
Animal Ethics Committee of Dalian Medical University.
Three millions Saos2 cells (at the concentration of
3 × 107 cells/ml) with overexpression of wild type or
mutant PLA2G16 were suspended in 50% Matrigel and
subcutaneously injected into nude mice. Tumor size
was calculated by ½ a2b (a is the short axis and b is the
long axis of tumor). Growth curve were plotted with the
mean tumor volume ± SEM. Thirty days after injection,
the animals were sacrificed and tumor was harvested,
measured, weighed and fixed in 10% formalin. Tumor
weight of each animal was calculated as mean ± SD from
animal in each group. Protein lysate were prepared from
the tumors for western blot analysis.
