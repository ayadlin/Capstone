ABSTRACT
The gut microbiota, including probiotics and pathogenic microorganisms, is
involved in ulcerative colitis (UC) by regulating pathogenic microorganisms and the
production of intestinal mucosal antibodies. Huangqin decoction (HQD), a traditional
Chinese formula chronicled in the Shanghan lun, has been recognized as an effective
drug for UC, owing to its anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative properties. In the
present study, we investigated whether HQD ameliorates dextran sulphate sodium
(DSS)-induced colitis through alteration of the gut microbiota. We found that HQD
significantly inhibited colitis, alleviating the loss of body weight, disease activity
index, colon shortening, tissue injury, and inflammatory cytokine changes induced
by DSS treatment. Principal component analysis and principal co-ordinate analysis
showed an obvious difference among the groups, with increased diversity in the DSS
and DSS+HQD groups. Linear discriminant analysis effect size was used to determine
differences between the groups. The relative abundance of Lactococcus was higher in
the DSS+HQD group than in the DSS group, whereas Desulfovibrio and Helicobacter
were decreased. Furthermore, the protective effect of HQD was attenuated only in
antibiotic-treated mice. In conclusion, our results suggest that HQD could ameliorate
DSS-induced inflammation through alteration of the gut microbiota.

INTRODUCTION

triggering factors are immunization, apoptosis, heredity,
physical environment, and infection [4]. Significant
progress has been made in understanding the pathogenesis
of human IBD, but its precise aetiology remains unknown.
The gut microbiota is part of a complex network
responsible for maintaining normal physiological
function. Studies indicate that the gut microbiota
responds to changes in the host and can produce vitamins
and active substances to combat pathogens by taking
energy from food [5]. Coexistence between the host
and the gut microbiota helps to shape the mucosal and

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a group of
inflammatory conditions of the colon and small intestine
that includes ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn’s disease
(CD) [1]. UC mainly begins in the rectum, spreads
proximally in a continuous fashion, and frequently
involves the periappendiceal region. It is characterized
by acute pain, vomiting, weight loss, diffuse mucosal
inflammation, diarrhoea, and bloody stools [2, 3].
Accumulated studies have shown that the major UCwww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

invades intestinal tissue and induces local or systemic
inflammation, the mucosal immune system has a number
of protective mechanisms that allow the host to mount an
appropriate immune response to invading bacteria [6].
The intestinal microbiota is considered to be a significant
factor in the aetiology of IBD [7].
There are more than 100 trillion microbes in the
human gut [8]. Of these microorganisms, which include
probiotics and pathogens, Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes
are the predominant members; Proteobacteria is the third
most common phylum. In recent years, an increasing
number of gut microorganisms have been detected
with high throughput sequencing. Metagenomic and
16S rRNA-based marker gene sequencing studies have
demonstrated reductions in biodiversity in patients with
IBD compared with healthy individuals [9]. Recent studies
have demonstrated that there is a significant difference in
the relative abundance of Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes
in active UC compared with the control [10]. Moreover,
a significant increase in Fusobacterium colonisation,
possibly associated with T-cell response and microRNA
expression, has been found in colon cancer tissues by
metagenomic analysis [11]. The gut microbiota has
become an important target in the treatment of irritable
bowel syndrome (IBS), and therapy has focused on
correcting intestinal microbial imbalance. Clinically, a low
FODMAP (fermentable oligo-, di-, and monosaccharides
and polyols) diet has been used to reduce symptoms in
patients with IBS by regulating the gut microbiota [12]. In
addition, a study revealed an existing relationship between
microbial agents and gastric cancer: chronic infection with
gram-negative bacteria Helicobacter pylori, Streptococcus
mitis, S. parasanguinis, Lactobacillus, Veillonella, and
Prevotella dominates flora in the microbiota of people
who develop gastric cancer [13–15]. The results of faecal
sample testing from patients with colorectal cancer (CRC)
and healthy individuals have shown that Enterococcus
and Streptococcus are increasingly present in samples
from CRC patients, while the butyrate-producing
bacteria Roseburia and Clostridium predominate in the
control samples [16]. Recent metagenomic studies have
demonstrated that there are differences in gut microbiota
between lean and obese individuals [17]. In addition, the
gut microbiota has a close relationship with type 2 diabetes.
Expression levels of genes involved in carbohydrate and
sulphur metabolism are increased in patients with diabetes
compared with that in control individuals [18].
Huangqin decoction (HQD), a classical traditional
Chinese herbal formulation, is widely used to ameliorate
gastrointestinal disorders such as IBD. It has been proven
that HQD is able to inhibit the expression levels of proinflammatory cytokines and the relative activity of NF-κB
p65 in mice [19, 20]. A recent study has suggested that
HQD can effectively inhibit the up-regulation of the Wnt/
β-catenin signalling pathway induced by unilateral ureteral
obstruction in mice, which suggests that HQD might
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

have a role in improving renal interstitial fibrosis  [21].
The active constituents in HQD, including bacalin,
wogonoside, oroxylin-A, paeonimetabolin-I, liquirigenin,
and glycyrrhetinic acid, have been determined using
high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) [22].
In our previous study, HQD inhibited the development
of acute/chronic colitis and prevented colitis-associated
CRC, possibly by inhibiting inflammation and preventing
oxidative stress-induced cellular damage [23]. The
relationship between HQD and the gut microbiota in colitis
was, however, not clear. In this study, we aim to investigate
changes in the microbiota when dextran sulphate sodium
(DSS)-induced colitis is ameliorated by HQD.

RESULTS
HQD ameliorates colitis and regulates cytokine
expression levels in the colon of mice with DSSinduced colitis
Colitis was induced in mice by administration of
3% DSS in drinking water for 7 days (Figure 1A). During
modelling, no difference in body weight was detected
between the HQD group and control group mice in the
first 5 days; a significant decrease in body weight was
then observed in DSS-treated mice. The mice in the
HQD group experienced less weight loss compared with
the DSS group mice at 7–9 days (Figure 1B). Generally,
disease activity index (DAI) exhibited features of loose
faeces, haematochezia and body weight reduction, and
was used to evaluate inflammation severity in mice with
colitis. The DAI score increased significantly after DSS
intake, whereas it was markedly attenuated in the HQDtreated group (Figure 1C). Colon shortening is another
index that reflects the severity of colorectal inflammation.
Figure 1D shows that a significant shortening of the
colon was observed in the DSS group compared with
the control and HQD groups. H&E-stained colorectal
sections showed that mice from the DSS group exhibited
distortion of crypts, loss of goblet cells, severe epithelial
injury, and inflammatory cell infiltration in the mucosa and
submucosa. The HQD group exhibited obvious protection
of the colon crypt structures and less severe histologic
inflammation (Figure 1E). Tumour necrosis factor alpha
(TNF-α), Interleukin 6 (IL-6), Interleukin 1 beta (IL-1β),
and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) play a pivotal role in
the onset of colitis. Compared with the control group,
the levels of TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, and COX-2 were
significantly increased in the colon of the DSS group. The
administration of HQD, however, significantly suppressed
the accumulation of TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, and COX-2 in
the colon tissues of mice with DSS-induced colitis. These
results suggest that HQD is capable of preventing DSSinduced colitis (Figure  1F). Taken together, our data
suggest that HQD exerts an anti-inflammatory action in
DSS-induced colitis and is capable of preventing DSSinduced colitis.

baseline structure, and the HQD group did not return to the
level of the control group (Figure 2D and 2E). The system
clustering tree showed that a significant difference existed
in the three groups, and the level of the HQD group was
close to that of the control group (Figure 2F).

We conducted a bar-coded pyrosequencing run
to analyse structural changes in the gut microbiota in
the three studied groups. In total, 746,978 usable reads
and 463 OTUs were obtained from the 15 samples.
Rarefaction and Shannon diversity curves are shown in
Figure 2A and 2B. The rarefaction curves plateau with the
current sequencing, indicating that most of the diversity
has already been captured in all samples. In addition, the
overlap of OTUs between groups revealed that 308 OTUs
coexisted in all three groups. A further 317 OTUs were
present in both the control and DSS groups, 338 in the
DSS and HQD groups, and 347 in the control and HQD
groups (Figure 2C). PCA and PCoA analyses revealed that
the gut microbiota in the DSS group deviated from the

shows that the relative abundance of Deferribacteres and
Epsilonproteobacteria was significantly different among
the three groups. Similarly, sequencing data identified
21 families of microbial flora. Anaeroplasmatales,
Enterobacteriales, and Rhodospirillales strains were

identified in the DSS and HQD groups but were not
detected in the control group. Conversely, Bacteroidales
and Bifidobacteriales were detected in the control group
but not in the other groups. As shown in Figure  3D,

the HQD group. An evolutionary clustering analysis
diagram was generated based on the LDA score to
identify important microflora using taxonomy. As
shown in Figure  4, the branches of candidate division
TM7, Bacillales, and Pseudomonadales were the major
microbiota in the control group. In the DSS group, the
predominant intestinal flora, including Deferribacteres,
Porphyromonadaceae, Bacteroidaceae, Enterobacteriales,
and Rhodospirillales, played an important role in the active
period of colitis. The branches of Anaeroplasmataceae and
Ruminococcus, however, were identified as novel superior
microbiota in the DSS+HQD group. Furthermore, the
results in Figure 5A–5C show that the relative abundance
of Bacteroides, Odoribacter, and Prevotellaceae_
uncultured in the DSS group was markedly higher than in
the control group, and there was no statistical difference
compared with the DSS+HQD group. The situation was
similar for the relative abundance of Helicobacter and
Desulfovibrio, but these were significantly decreased with

HQD. Taken together, these results show that HQD could
change the microbial composition in the intestine and
inhibit the proliferation of certain bacteria.

Gut microbiota drives attenuation of DSSinduced ulcerative colitis by HQD
In previous experiments, it has been found that
HQD ameliorates DSS-induced acute colitis in mice by
inhibiting pro-inflammatory factors. Moreover, HQD could
change the composition of the gut microbiota and inhibit
the growth of certain bacteria. We therefore carried out
further experiments to prove the relationship between the
gut microbiota and the anti-inflammatory effects of HQD.
Mice were administered a broad-spectrum antibiotic
(AB) in drinking water for 30 days [24]. When we
cultured the faeces, almost no bacterial growth was found
(Supplementary Figure 1). Colitis was then induced by
administration of 3% DSS in drinking water for 7 days

(Figure 6A). This resulted in a significant decrease in body
weight in DSS-treated mice. At 5–6 days, the mice in the
AB+DSS group exhibited significant weight loss compared
with the DSS group mice (Figure 6B). Although gradual
weight loss was observed in the AB+DSS+HQD group,
there was no obvious difference compared with the DSS
group. As shown in Figure 6C, the DAI score increased
significantly after DSS intake, whereas it was markedly
increased in the AB+DSS group. Figure 6D shows that
a significant shortening of the colon was observed in the
DSS, AB+DSS and AB+DSS+HQD groups compared
with that in the control group. Similarly, H&E-stained
colon sections showed that all groups exhibited distortion
of the crypts, loss of goblet cells, severe epithelial injury,
and inflammatory cell infiltration in the mucosa and
submucosa (Figure 6E). Thus, in microbiota-depleted
conditions, the sensitivity to DSS-induced colitis was
increased, and HQD did not prevent DSS-induced colitis.

The above results suggest that the gut microbiota drives
the attenuation of DSS-induced ulcerative colitis by HQD.

DISCUSSION
Inflammatory bowel disease, including UC and CD,
is a chronic inflammatory condition of the gastrointestinal
tract. In recent years, many studies have shown that UC is
associated with genetic and environment factors that lead
to impairment of the intestinal mucosal barrier. Previous
studies have reported that IL-10−/− , TRAF6IEC-KO and
TMF−/− mice are susceptible to colitis [24, 25]. Moreover,
it has been confirmed that attenuation of the Bridging
integrator  1 gene can limit UC pathogenicity in mice
by supporting mucosal barrier function and protecting
the integrity of the lymphoid follicle, thereby offering a
novel strategy to treat UC and possibly limiting the risk
of colorectal cancer.

Although UC is generally treated with antiinflammatory or immunosuppressive drugs, most of these
treatments often prove to be inadequate and have various
side effects. Consequently, many traditional plant-based
remedies have recently been explored as alternative
treatments. Many studies have investigated the mechanism
of action of traditional Chinese medicine on  UC. Our
previous studies have shown that Banxia xiexin decoction
and Huangqin decoction could protect against DSSinduced colitis through their anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities [23, 26]. It has been demonstrated that
Huangqin Tang could inhibit the relative activity of NF-κB
p65 and decrease the expression levels of NO, IL-6,
TNF-α, and COX-2. An increasing number of studies
have recently focused on the relationship between UC
and the gut microflora [27]. The gut microbiota, including
symbiotic, probiotic, and pathogenic microorganisms,
plays an important role in human health. Its balance can
be destroyed by the introduction of invasive antigens into
the organism, activation of immune cells, and production
of cytokines. Therefore, it is of great significance to
investigate the relationship between HQD and the gut
microbiota in DSS-induced colitis in mice.
In this study, we investigated the anti-inflammatory
role of HQD in the in vivo model of colitis induced by
DSS in C57BL/6 mice. After treatment with DSS, the mice
exhibited clinical symptoms and pathological changes
corresponding to those of human UC, including loss of
body weight, diarrhoea, bloody faeces, mucosal ulceration,
and shortening of the colon. Two different concentrations
of HQD along with DSS were used to evaluate its
therapeutic effect on UC. The results demonstrate that
HQD significantly suppresses DSS-induced colitis by
decreasing DAI scores, weight loss, and colonic shortening.
The results of histopathology findings were consistent
with DAI data. As shown in Figure 1, the colons of mice
treated with DSS presented more severe inflammatory cell
infiltration, mucosal erosion, and both distortion and loss
of crypts. In contrast, administration of HQD reduced all
of the above-mentioned inflammatory changes, suggesting
that HQD could ameliorate the inflammatory condition
induced by DSS. Furthermore, the expression levels of
pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, COX-2, IL-6, and
IL-1β) were measured in colonic tissue [26]. The results of
RT-qPCR confirmed the up-regulation of pro-inflammatory
cytokines in the DSS group and their down-regulation in
the HQD administrated group.
Microbiological composition was determined
in mice by high-throughput sequencing. As shown in
Table 1, the Simpson and Shannon indices reveal that the
microbial diversity in DSS and DSS+HQD groups was
greater than in the control. The PCA and PcoA analyses
suggest that a significant distance existed between the
three groups, with a shorter distance between the control
and HQD groups. The gut microbiota community in all
samples was evaluated based on the following criteria:
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

phylum, class, order, family, and genus. In accordance
with previous research, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, and
Proteobacteria were the dominant phyla found in the
gut, while Verrucomicrobia, candidate division TM7 and
Actinobacteria occupied a second tier10. Statistical results
reveal that there was no difference between the groups
in abundance of Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes, which is
inconsistent with previous studies. We speculate that the
possible cause behind this finding is a difference in feeding
environment. Our results have also shown, however, that
HQD could change the relative abundance of Helicobacter,
Desulfovibrio and Lactobacillus strains. Helicobacter
pylori is a bacterium that causes chronic gastritis and peptic
ulcer disease and, to a lesser extent, mucosa-associated
lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma and gastric cancer in
infected individuals. Numerous studies have reported that
the prevalence of H. pylori infection is lower in patients
with IBD compared to controls [28], whereas Helicobacter
infection is higher in mice with colitis compared to the
control and DSS+HQD groups. The reason behind the
difference is that our result is based on the gut microbiota,
while previous studies focused on the serum of patients.
Therefore, the relationship between Helicobacter and
colitis needs to be investigated further. Desulfovibrio, a
type of intestinal sulphate-reducing bacteria harmful to
colonic epithelial cells, was more prevalent in mice with
colitis induced by DSS. As shown by our results, the
relative abundance of Desulfovibrio increased significantly
in the DSS group but decreased significantly in the HQD
group. The above results suggest that HQD could inhibit
the growth of harmful bacteria in the gut. Moreover, the
relative abundance of Lactobacillus decreased in DSSinduced colitis, which is in accordance with previous
studies [29]. A significant increase, however, was found
in the HQD group compared with that in the DSS group.
Therefore, we suspect that HQD could promote the growth
of beneficial bacteria in the gut. In a CPT-11 treated anticolon cancer tumor allografts model, HQD changed
the profile of intestinal bacterial species: Lactobacillus/
Enterococcus, Bacteroides, Clostridium leptum, and E.
rectale/C. coccoides [30]. A recent finding indicated that
the density of C. leptum is significantly reduced in the
faecal microbiota of patients with Crohn’s disease and
ulcerative colitis [31]. HQD can increase the density of
C. leptum in colonic tissue. HQD is also able to maintain
C. leptum levels in the colon following CPT-11 treatment.
Therefore, HQD may have potential benefit in treating IBD
by restoring the density of C. leptum in the colon [30].
Several studies have reported that individual
herbs of HQD possess antibiotic activity. Different
chemicals derived from Paeonia lactiflora were found
to have different activities against intestinal flora  [32].
It was found that human intestinal bacteria could
transform flavonoids of Scutellaria baicalensis into
aglycone flavonoids, baicalein, oroxylin A, wogonin and
norwogonin, each of which has different potencies against

different types of intestinal bacteria [33]. Glycyrrhizol
A and 6,8-diisoprenyl-5,7,4’-trihydroxyisoflavone (5)
isolated form Glycyrrhiza uralensis were shown to
exhibit potent antibacterial activity against Streptococcus
mutants  [34]. Crude ethanol extracts of Ziziphus
jujuba fruits were also reported to exhibit antibacterial
activity [35]. Future investigations, such as a comparison
of the impacts of different herbal combinations of HQD
on intestinal bacterial profiles, could help us to address
the herb(s) or chemical(s) responsible for the specific
antibiotic activities of HQD.
Although the effect of HQD on DSS-induced
colitis and the gut microbiota was clearly revealed, the
relationship between the anti-inflammatory role of HQD
and the gut microbiota remained undefined. Consequently,
an experiment was conducted to test the effect of HQD
on DSS mice treated preliminarily with a broad-spectrum
antibiotic. In our study, mice with DSS-induced colitis
showed no significant distinction compared with mice
from the HQD treated group, and only slight symptoms
compared with the AB+DSS group. The results show no
effect of HQD in mice subjected to an antibiotic and DSS.
Based on the findings, we confirm that HQD exhibits
anti-inflammatory in vivo effects by changing the gut
microbiota, which might have potential applications in the
treatment of UC. In future studies, we plan to apply faecal
transplantation assays to the study of different herbal
combinations of HQD on intestinal bacterial profiles; this
could help us to clarify the detailed mechanism underlying
the gut microbiota regulation activities of HQD.

All four medical plants, namely Scutellaria
baicalensis Georgi, Paeonia lactiflora Pall, Glycyrrhiza
uralensis Fisch, and Ziziphus jujuba Mill were provided
by the Jiangsu Province Academy of Traditional Chinese
Medicine (Nanjing, Jiangsu, China); the detailed
composition of HQD is listed in Supplementary Table S1.
The HQD was soaked in ten-fold distilled water for 30 min
before heating. The herbs were then heated to 100°C for
30 min; the decoction was filtered through a multi-layer
gauze. The residue was diluted eight-fold using distilled
water for a second extraction. The filtrates were obtained
under the same conditions and those obtained from two
cycles of extraction were mixed for use.
Waters e2695 Alliance HPLC system (Waters Corp.,
MA, USA) with a 2489 UV/Vis DAD detector was used
for qualitative analysis of HQD aqueous extracts. Extracts
were separated by an Inertsil ODS-SP C18 column
(250  mm × 4.6 mm, 5μm). The injection volume was
10 μl. The mobile phase consisted of linear gradients of
0.1% (v/v) formic acid (A) and acetonitrile (B): 0–15 min,
100–95% A (v/v), 0–5% B (v/v); 15–30 min, 95–85% A,

40–90% A, 60–5% B. The mobile phase flow rate was
1 mL/min. The column was run at 30°C. Single herbal,
HQD extracts, and purified chemical reference substances
(Supplementary Figures 2, 3 and Supplementary Table 2)
were used for quantitation by HPLC. The validation of
this quantitative HPLC method showed that the method
was sensitive, precise, and stable (Supplementary Table 3)
[23, 36, 37].

All procedures involving animals were approved by
the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the
Jiangsu Province Institute of Traditional Chinese Medicine
and written up following the ARRIVE guidelines.
Experiments were performed in accordance with published
National Institutes of Health guidelines. 6–8-week-old
C57BL/6 male healthy mice were used to adapt to the
laboratory conditions for 1 week prior to the experiments.
Ulcerative colitis was induced in mice by administering
3% DSS (W/V) solution in distilled water for 7 days.
In the HQD group, the mice received 9.1 g/kg HQD via

sequencing

oral gavage daily along with DSS. Mice in control group
and DSS group consumed the same volume of water as
controls. In the last two days, mice in the experiments
were given distilled water (Figure 1A).
For antibiotic treatment, 1 g/L ampicillin (ICN
Biomedicals), 1 g/L neomycin (Sigma), 0.5 g/L meronem
(AstraZeneca) and 0.5 g/L vancomycin (Sigma) were
added to the drinking water for 30 days. AB-containing
drinking water was refreshed every second day [24].

Genomic DNA was extracted from every stool
sample using the E.Z.N.A.® Soil DNA Kit according
to manufacturer’s protocols (Omega Bio-tek,
Norcross, GA, USA). The primers 338F (5′-barcodeACTCCTACGGGAGGCAGCA-3′)
and
806R
(5′-GGACTACHVGGGTWTCTAAT -3′), where barcode
is an eight-base sequence unique to each sample, were
used to amplify the V3-V4 region of the bacteria 16S
ribosomal RNA gene. The steps of PCR as follows:
95°C for 3 min, 27 cycles at 95°C for 30 s, 55°C for 30
s, and 72°C for 45 s and a final extension at 72°C for 10
min. PCR reactions were performed in triplicate: 20 μL
mixture containing 4 μL of 5 × FastPfu Buffer, 2 μL of
2.5 mM dNTPs, 0.8 μL of each primer (5 μM), 0.4 μL
of FastPfu Polymerase (Transgene, Beijing, China), and
10 ng of template DNA. Amplicons were extracted from
2% agarose gels and purified using the AxyPrep DNA Gel
Extraction Kit (Axygen Biosciences, Union City, CA,
U.S.) according to the manufacturer’s instructions and
quantified using QuantiFluor™ -ST (Promega, Wisconsin,
USA). Purified amplicons were pooled in equimolar
and paired-end sequenced (2 × 250) on an Illumina
MiSeq platform according to the standard protocols.
The raw reads were deposited into the NCBI Sequence
Read Archive (SRA) database. Raw fastq files were
demultiplexed, quality-filtered using QIIME (version
1.17). Reads that could not be assembled were discarded.

Evaluation of DSS colitis
During all experiments, daily routine clinical
evaluations were performed, including body weight
measurement, stool characteristics and hematochezia
determination. The evaluation of disease activity index
(DAI) was performed using Murano’s methods by
combining the scores of weight loss, stool consistency
and rectal bleeding. Animals were sacrificed by cervical
dislocation under anaesthesia. The colon was removed
and its length was determined. Luminal contents were
removed from the cecum and colon, placed in sterile
tube and stored at −80°C. The distal colon was fixed
in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight and embedded in
paraffin for routine H&E histopathologic examination to
arrive at a histologic score as follows. For cell infiltration
of inflammatory cells, rare inflammatory cells in the
lamina propria were counted as 0; increased numbers of
inflammatory cells, including neutrophils in the lamina
propria as 1; confluence of inflammatory cells, extending
into the submucosa as 2; and a score of 3 was given for
transmural extension of the inflammatory cell infiltrate.
For epithelial damage, absence of mucosal damage was
counted as 0, discrete focal lymphoepithelial lesions were
counted as 1, mucosal erosion/ulceration was counted as 2,
and a score of 3 was given for extensive mucosal damage
and extension through deeper structures of the bowel wall.
The two subscores were added and the combined histologic
score ranged from 0 (no changes) to 6 (extensive cell
infiltration and tissue damage) [38]. The expression levels
of inflammatory cytokines, including IL-1β, IL-6, COX2 and TNF-a, were detected by Real-time qPCR. Primers
used for the reactions were purchased from Genscript and
the primer sequences are listed as followed: IL-1β(Forward:
5′- ACTCATTGTGGCTGTGGAGA-3′, Reverse: 5′TTGTTCATCTCGGAGCCTGT -3′), IL-6 (Forward:
5′- CTGCAAGAGACTTCCATCCAGTT-3′, Reverse: 5′GAAGTAGGGAAGGCCGTGG-3′), COX-2(Forward:
5′- CACCCTGACATAGACAGTGAAAG-3′, Reverse:
5′- CTGGGTCACGTTGGATGAGG-3′), TNF-a(Forward:
5′- GACCCCTTTACTCTGACCCC-3′, Reverse: 5′AGGCTCCAGTGAATTCGGAA -3′), β-actin(Forward:
5′- TCCTGTGGCATCCACGAAACT -3′, Reverse: 5′GAAGCATTTGCGGTGGACGAT -3′). ALL genes’ mRNA
expression was normalized against β-actin expression.

Bioinformatics analysis
Operational Units (OTUs) were clustered with
97% similarity cutoff using UPARSE (version 7.1 http://
drive5.com/uparse/), and chimeric sequences were
identified and removed using UCHIME. Phylogenetic
affiliation of each 16S rRNA gene sequence was analysed
by RDP Classifier (http://rdp.cme.msu.edu/) against the
silva (SSU117/119)16S rRNA database using confidence
threshold of 70%. The representative sequences of
operational taxonomy units (OTUs) and their relative
abundance were used to calculate the rarefaction analysis
and Shannon diversity index by QIIME. The veen,
phylogenetic tree, Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
and Principal Coordinate Analysis (PCoA) were then used
to analyse the diversity between groups. The dominant
bacterial community difference between groups was
detected using LDA Effect Size.

Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS
software version 15.0. Data were presented as mean ± SD.
Unpaired Student t tests were used to compare the means

of two groups. One-way analysis of variance and Adonis
were used to compare the means of three groups. A level
of P < 0.05 was considered as statistically significant.
