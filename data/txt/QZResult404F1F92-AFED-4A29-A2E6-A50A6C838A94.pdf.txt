ABSTRACT
Constitutively active receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) are known oncogenic
drivers and provide valuable therapeutic targets in many cancer types. However,
clinical efficacy of RTK inhibitors is limited by intrinsic and acquired resistance. To
identify genes conferring resistance to inhibition of the MET RTK, we conducted
a forward genetics screen in the GTL-16 gastric cancer cell line, carrying MET
amplification and exquisitely sensitive to MET inhibition. Cells were transduced
with three different retroviral cDNA expression libraries and selected for growth in
the presence of the MET inhibitor PHA-665752. Selected cells displayed robust and
reproducible enrichment of library-derived cDNAs encoding truncated forms of RAF1
and BRAF proteins, whose silencing reversed the resistant phenotype. Transduction
of naïve GTL-16 cells with truncated, but not full length, RAF1 and BRAF conferred
in vitro and in vivo resistance to MET inhibitors, which could be reversed by MEK
inhibition. Induction of resistance by truncated RAFs was confirmed in other METaddicted cell lines, and further extended to EGFR-addicted cells. These data show
that truncated RAF1 and BRAF proteins, recently described as products of genomic
rearrangements in gastric cancer and other malignancies, have the ability to render
neoplastic cells resistant to RTK-targeted therapy.

INTRODUCTION

receptor MET emerged as a promising RTK therapeutic
target in a variety of human cancers [5-7]. Drugs
targeting the HGF/MET axis, either small-molecule
kinase inhibitors or monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), are
currently under clinical testing [8-10]. Copy number
gains of the MET gene are particularly frequent in human
gastric carcinoma, where protein overexpression occurs
in about one quarter of the cases [11]. Gastric cancer
cells carrying MET amplification and overexpression
have been found to be particularly susceptible to its
pharmacological inhibition [12], which corroborates the
therapeutic potential of MET inhibition in MET-addicted
gastric cancers. However, RTK-targeted therapies are
not effective in all cases, and even responsive patients

Deregulated RTKs have been implicated in the
development and progression of numerous human cancers
[1]. Aberrant RTK activation can be caused by different
mechanisms, such as autocrine/paracrine stimulation,
chromosomal translocations, amplification/overexpression
and gain-of-function mutations. In addicted cancers,
abnormal RTK activity is required for tumor growth
and survival [2]. Hence, in such cases, pharmacological
targeting of activated RTKs can profoundly affect
growth and survival of tumor cells, leading to clinically
meaningful responses in patients [3, 4].
Recently, the Hepatocyte Growth Factor (HGF)

invariably develop secondary resistance, either for
compensations in the signalling networks or for activation/
overexpression of a different RTK or other cell signalling
proteins [13-15]. It is increasingly clear that a better
understanding of the resistance mechanisms, along with
the identification of novel response modifiers, is crucial to
increase the effectiveness of targeted therapy.
We therefore set to identify potential mediators of
resistance to MET inhibition in cancer cells. There are
two main screening strategies to generate drug-resistant
cells starting from a sensitive population: (i) induction of
spontaneous resistance by long-term drug treatment [16];
(ii) functional screens by transduction of the sensitive
cells with cDNA or shRNA libraries [17]. Determinants
of resistance to MET inhibition have been successfully
identified by long-term drug treatments [18, 19], which
however rely on genetic events that could either be preexisting in a small fraction of cells or occur during the
selection process by de novo mutagenesis. In both cases
the spectrum of identifiable events is limited. We thus
performed a complementary screening based on the gainof-function approach, by which target cells are transduced
with full length cDNA expression libraries and then
subjected to a selective treatment invariably inducing cell
death or growth arrest. Only cells expressing exogenous
cDNAs conferring resistance to the treatment will grow
and form resistant populations [17, 20]. The model of
choice was the GTL-16 cell line, derived from a poorly
differentiated gastric adenocarcinoma, in which the
MET gene locus is amplified, leading to overexpression
of constitutively active MET protein [18]. GTL-16 cells
are addicted to MET and respond to small-molecule
MET inhibitors with proliferative block and apoptosis
[21]. For the screen, GTL-16 cells were transduced with
multiple retroviral cDNA expression libraries and selected
with the MET inhibitor PHA-665752 (PHA) [21]. The
“Xenorarray” approach was then employed to identify, by
gene expression arrays, library-derived cDNAs enriched
in the selected, resistant populations [22, 23] (Figure 1A).

GFP-transduced cells (Supplementary Figure 1). GFP- or
library-transduced GTL-16 cells were selected in presence
of the MET inhibitor PHA at 300nM for eight weeks. By
this time no spontaneous resistance was previously found
to occur in non-transduced cells. Cells recovered after
selection were assayed for their ability to grow in the
presence or absence of PHA. All populations of librarytransduced selected GTL-16 cells displayed a significant
resistance to PHA compared to unselected counterparts
and to both selected and unselected GFP-transduced cells
(Figure 1B). These results suggest a biological effect of
the library not explained with insertional mutagenesis,
but likely deriving from the expression of exogenous
transcripts.

Identification and validation of library-derived
cDNAs encoding for RAF1 variants in cells that
survived selection with MET inhibitor PHA
To identify cDNAs promoting resistance to PHA,
we quantified the abundance of library-derived transcripts
in transduced cells before and after PHA selection. In
this way, we avoided the need of isolating clones and
performing multiple screening cycles. In the case of the
mouse testis library, endogenous and exogenous transcripts
are from different species, and sequence divergence
between orthologue transcripts can be exploited as a
“molecular barcode” for species-specific hybridization
on microarrays [22]. In the case of human kidney and
spleen libraries, we verified that the retroviral vectorspecific primer used for reverse transcription (T7-pFB)
allows selective reverse transcription of library-derived
transcripts (Supplementary Figure 1). In all infections,
numerous array probes displayed a higher signal in
selected cells compared to unselected, indicating that cells
expressing the respective transcripts were enriched by the
selection. Many other transcripts were lost, indicating
that cells carrying them had died during the selection.
To identify the genes that were reproducibly enriched in
selected cells, we calculated, for each transcript, the ratio
of the array signal before and after selection. Interestingly,
the RAF1 transcript showed a strong enrichment in all
infections/selections (Table 1 and Figure 1C, D and E).
We validated RAF1 enrichment in all selections by
realtime quantitative PCR (RT-PCR) (see Supplementary
Methods). Four pairs of PCR primers were designed,
two against murine Raf1 (for the MmT-transduced cells)
and two against human RAF1 (for the HsK and HsStransduced cells), covering the 5’ portion and the 3’
portion of the transcripts (Figure 2A). Surprisingly, only
the primer pairs corresponding to the 3’ region confirmed
murine RAF1 mRNA enrichment in all selections
(Figure 2B and C). Subsequently, Western blot analysis
of the enriched populations compared to controls were
performed. In the selected, resistant GTL-16 populations,

GTL-16 cells were transduced in duplicate with
retroviral cDNA expression libraries obtained from
Mouse Testis (MmT), Human Spleen (HsS) and Human
Kidney (HsK), or with GFP as a control. Microarraybased quantification of library-derived transcripts
(see Supplementary Methods) [22] confirmed that all
transduced populations carried a consistent number of
detectable library-derived transcripts, in addition to a
small fraction of background transcripts, also detected in

RAF1 antibody detected lower molecular weight bands,
compared to the full length control, confirming the
hypothesis that the enriched cDNAs encoded for truncated
proteins, lacking the N-terminal region (Figure 2D and E).
To verify the composition of the expression
libraries before and after PHA selection, we conceived
an approach based on deep-sequencing of retroviral
library inserts, exploiting targeted reverse transcription
(see Supplementary Methods) of RNA obtained from
GTL-16 transduced with HsS library, before and after
selection, in two independent replicates, using the GS
FLX 454 to maximize reads length. The single lanes
yielded respectively 420456 and 365867 reads for the two
unselected populations and 119949 and 144378 reads for
the selected populations. Average read length was around
300 nt. All the reads were mapped with BLAST on RAF1
mRNA sequence to evaluate its abundance and sequence.
RAF1 coverage was quite low in unselected cells, and
evenly distributed across all the transcript sequence
(Supplementary Figure 2A). As expected, RAF1 coverage
was much higher in selected cells, with a sharp decline
of coverage 5’ from nucleotides 1000-1500 of the RAF1
mRNA in both selected samples (Supplementary Figure
2B). To identify reads compatible with RAF1 truncations,

we selected all the reads with matches on both RAF1 and
retroviral vector sequence. This analysis revealed that in
both selections some reads captured the point of transition
from the RAF1 sequence to the vector cloning site, all
at the same site of RAF1 (Supplementary Figure 2C).
This result shows that, albeit in the original expression
library the major form of RAF1 cDNA is full length, PHA
selection drives enrichment of a variant that contains
the kinase domain, but lacks the N-terminal regulatory
domain. No other truncation forms were identified by the
analysis, suggesting that this is the most represented form
of RAF1 in two independent selections.
To search for truncated forms of RAF1 in published
data, we interrogated the ProteinQuest (BioDigitalValley)
data mining platform that integrates information from
scientific literature, data repositories and biological
images. This tool generated an image derived from the
sum of all published pictures of SDS-page/Western
Blots against the C-terminal portion of RAF1 and
highlighted the presence of multiple possible truncated
forms of this protein (Supplementary Figure 3 and
Supplementary Methods). We then cloned and sequenced
RAF1 containing transcripts from all the selected cell
populations. In all cases the RAF1 transcripts enriched

transduced cells, because in these cells the library-derived
Raf1 is murine and therefore can be silenced by murine
specific shRNAs without interference with endogenous
human RAF1. Two different murine Raf1 shRNAs and
the non-silencing control lentiviral supernatants were used
to transduce MmT-selected, resistant GTL-16 population,
and Western Blot analysis showed a good silencing only
with shRNA targeting the C-terminal portion of the gene
(Figure 3A). RT-PCR analysis confirmed the capability of
Raf1 shRNA-3’ to downregulate the expression of Raf1
in MmT-selected GTL-16 (Figure 3B). A growth assay
confirmed that resistance of MmT-selected GTL-16 cells
to PHA was lost when murine Raf1 was silenced (Figure
3C). These results prove that RAF1 plays a causative role
in mediating resistance to MET inhibition.

shRNA-3’ was found to silence very efficiently the murine
Raf1 in infected-selected GTL-16 and to be specific
for the murine transcript and therefore not to interfere
with endogenous human RAF1 in GTL-16 cells; (iii)
therefore, use of GTL-16 transduced with murine Raf1
shRNA-3’ as recipient cells for the MmT library should
allow additional weaker candidates to emerge upon PHA
selection. Accordingly, wild-type GTL-16 cells were first
transduced with murine Raf1 shRNA-3’ and then with the
mouse testis library or GFP, in duplicate. After 8 weeks
of in PHA selection under the same conditions described
above, only library-infected, selected cells became
resistant to PHA (Figure 4A), although to a lower extent
that the previously selected cells. In both independent
selections, xenoarray analysis showed that the murine
cDNA enriched in selected cells was Braf (Figure 4B).
We performed PCR validation using two oligonucleotide
pairs, one corresponding to the 5’ and the other to the
3’ portion of the Braf transcript and, again, only the
C-terminal primer pair confirmed cDNA enrichment
in both selections (Figure 4C). Western Blot analysis
demonstrated that also the Braf protein is truncated in
selected cells (Figure 4D). We then cloned and sequenced
the enriched Braf transcript, and found a truncated
transcript starting at M475 (Supplementary Figure 4B).

BRAF is an additional mediator of PHA-665752
resistance in GTL-16 cells.
The data obtained in previous experiments prompted
to perform a new screening with this rationale: (i)
Darwinian selection of the most resistant cells, carrying
truncated Raf1, may have not allowed enrichment of other
possible interesting, though weaker, hits; (ii) murine Raf1

regulatory domains, is missing.

did not show resistance to PHA nor to JNJ38877605
(JNJ, a novel “second generation” MET inhibitor) [24]
in a range of concentrations (Supplementary Figure 5C
and D). It appeared therefore likely that both RAF1 and
BRAF confer resistance to MET inhibition only when
lacking the N-terminal regulatory portion. We therefore
transduced GTL-16 cells with truncated human RAF1
and BRAF, resembling those actually observed in
human tumors (Supplementary Figure 4). RT-PCR and
Western Blot analyses (Supplementary Figure 6A and
B) confirmed robust expression of truncated transcripts
and proteins. We found that cells expressing truncated
RAFs were resistant to the MET inhibitors JNJ (Figure
5A) and PHA (Supplementary Figure 7). We reasoned that
RAF blocking drugs would be able to restore sensitivity
to PHA in GTL-16 cells expressing truncated RAFs.
However, RAF1 selective inhibitors are not available, and

Truncated but not full length RAF kinases confer
resistance to MET inhibition, which is reversed by

To confirm whether RAF1 and BRAF were drivers
of resistance to MET inhibition, we transduced full length
human RAF1 and BRAF in wild-type GTL-16 cells.
RT-PCR and Western Blot analysis confirmed robust
expression of both RAF1 and BRAF transcripts and
proteins (Supplementary Figure 5A and B). However, a
growth assay performed on transduced and control cells

truncated forms of BRAF have been previously associated
with resistance to the corresponding inhibitors [25]. We
therefore decided to target MEK, a downstream effector of
RAF proteins. GTL-16 cells expressing truncated RAF1 or
BRAF were therefore tested for sensitivity to the MEK1/2
inhibitor AZD6244, either alone or in combination with
PHA. While ineffective alone, AZD6244 reverted RAFdriven resistance to MET inhibition in GTL-16 cells
(Supplementary Figure 8)
To evaluate whether resistance to MET inhibition
in GTL-16 cells transduced with truncated BRAF
or RAF1 was also maintained in vivo, we performed
xenograft experiments in nude mice. Since PHA has poor
pharmacokinetic properties and low oral bioavailability
[21], we treated the grafted nude mice with the orally
available JNJ (40mg/kg/day). JNJ administration
exhibited a prominent cytostatic effect on tumors obtained

from GTL-16 control cells, whose growth was halted.
Conversely, xenografts from cells transduced with either
of the two truncated RAFs continued growing despite
treatment with the MET inhibitor (Figure 5B). These
results show that expression of truncated RAF kinases
renders GTL-16 cells resistant to MET inhibition also in
vivo.

could drive resistance to RTK inhibition also in other

MET addicted) and NCI-H508 (caecal adenocarcinoma,
EGFR addicted), were transduced with truncated RAFs
and GFP control vector. RT-PCR and Western Blot
analysis confirmed truncated RAFs expression at high
levels (Supplementary Figure 6A and B). As shown in
Figure 5A, all MET-addicted cells acquired resistance
to MET inhibition by JNJ when transduced with either
of the truncated RAFs. Identical results were obtained

when PHA was used to inhibit MET, or when the EGFR
targeted drug Cetuximab was used on NCI-H508 cells
(Supplementary Figure 7). These data show that resistance
to RTK inhibition can be induced by truncated RAF1 or
BRAF in multiple cell lines, of different origin (stomach,
lung and intestine) and addicted to different RTKs (MET,
EGFR).

DISCUSSION

[38-40], but only recently many aberrant forms of RAF
genes have been described and associated to cancer
progression. The presence of BRAF and RAF1 fusions
has been reported to activate mitogen activated kinase-like
protein (MAPK) in pilocytic astrocytoma [34]. Another
study found rearrangements in gastric, prostate cancer
and melanoma that involve again fusions containing
BRAF or RAF1 segments [41]. All these rearrangements
were characterized by 5’ regulatory elements of highly
expressed genes fused to the C-terminal portion of
BRAF or RAF1 gene. As an example, in prostate cancer
rearrangements occurred between untranslated exon 1 of
SLC45A3 (a prostate-specific androgen responsive gene)
and exon 8 of BRAF (GenBank GU149303) or between
exon 13 of ESRP1 (an epithelial splicing regulatory
protein) and exon 6 of RAF1 (GenBank GU149302). All
these alterations involve the loss of N-terminal regulatory
domain of RAFs, indicating that the aberrant proteins are
constitutively active. Intriguingly, in GTL-16 cells selected
with the MET inhibitor we have found a murine truncated
Braf sequence that is homologous and share exactly the
same predicted open reading frame of a rearranged BRAF
found in human prostate cancer.
In addition to genomic rearrangements in cancer,
RAF proteins may be physiologically truncated by
proteolytic cleavage as part of cell survival pathways. In
particular, cleavage of RAF1 by caspase-9 was found to
protect hematopoietic cells from IL-3 withdrawal-induced
apoptosis [42]. Also in this case the resulting truncated
RAF1 lacks the N-terminal domain, so that the C-terminal
kinase domain can directly interact with the mitochondria
to inhibit apoptosis. A similar mechanism could enable
cancer cells to escape apoptosis induced by RTK-targeted
drugs.
The identification of translocations affecting RAF
genes in prostate, gastric cancers and melanoma provided
evidence for the key role of RAF signaling in a subset
of these cancers and suggested possible new personalized
cancer therapy. Several studies identified activated RAF
proteins as possible candidates for drug treatment [43],
but also highlighted possible mechanisms of resistance
to RAF inhibition [37, 44, 45], including truncations [25,
46]. In principle tumors with activated RAFs but resistant
to their inhibition should be sensitive to inhibitors of
downstream hubs in the same pathway, such as MEK
inhibitors. Indeed, in our model, the MEK inhibitor
AZD6244 abrogated RAF-driven resistance of GTL-16
cells to MET inhibition. This study therefore indicates
a role of RAF truncations in resistance to RTK-targeted
therapy, and provides a rationale for future testing of
combinatorial treatment approaches.

The HGF-MET axis, tightly regulated under normal
conditions and involved in epithelial cell proliferation and
motility during development, appears to play an important
role in oncogenesis, particularly in the development of the
invasive and metastatic phenotypes [5]. MET inhibition is
an attractive opportunity for molecularly targeted cancer
therapy [6, 7]. However, intrinsic or acquired resistance
can lead to limited therapeutic effectiveness and disease
progression. Similar to other RTKs, development of
resistance to MET inhibitors may occur via MET
amplification [26] or sequence mutations preventing drug
binding [27]. It has also been previously reported that
the activation of EGFR family receptors [28], or KRAS,
BRAF or AKT [29] can bypass MET inhibition. Indeed,
several drugs have been developed to inhibit MET protein,
but the mechanisms of resistance have not been fully
elucidated [5].
To anticipate potential resistance mechanisms, we
carried out an in vitro functional screening to identify
genes conferring MET inhibitor resistance to GTL-16, a
MET-addicted gastric carcinoma cell line with high level
amplification of the MET gene locus. Here, we report the
identification of truncated RAF1 and BRAF as strong
determinants of resistance to MET inhibition in GTL16 cells. The experimental approach described above is
extremely reproducible. We identified truncated forms
of RAF genes in three different cDNA libraries of two
different species, and results were confirmed in in vitro
and in vivo models.
It must be acknowledged that the truncated variants
of RAF genes found by our screens are likely to derive
from cDNA cloning artifacts. It is possible that the source
of truncated transcripts could be attributed to secondary
mRNA structures in the phase of reverse transcription
prior to cloning cDNAs in the retroviral expression
library. However, truncated and fusion RAF1 and BRAF
transcripts have been found to occur in several cancer
cell lines and tumor samples [30-35]. Recently, long-term
treatment of GTL-16 cells with a MET inhibitor was found
to generate spontaneously resistant cells. A fusion gene
coding for a truncated BRAF protein was identified in the
resistant population, although not functionally validated
as the driver of the resistance [19]. In our work, we find
that RAF1 could play a significant role in resistance to
RTK-targeted treatment. To our knowledge, such a causal
relationship has not been reported before.
The functional and biochemical properties of RAF
truncated variants have been extensively studied since
the discovery in 1983 of a viral oncogene encoding
a RAF1 kinase lacking the N-terminal domain [36].
Indeed, lack of the N-terminal RAF regulatory domains
is known to render RAF kinases constitutively active
[37]. In the past, several studies supported the ability of
truncated RAF1 to induce transformation in fibroblasts

treated with different drug concentrations. The stain
was performed with crystal violet after cell fixing with
a solution of 3% paraformaldeide and 1% glucose. Cell
viability was measured after 3, 7 and 14 days. Cell
viability was determined seeding 1,5 x 103 cells in 100
µl of final volume for each well, in a 96-well plate. Cells
were cultured in the specific medium with 10% FBS
(Sigma). The next day cells were treated at increasing
drug concentrations. After 96 hours, ATP measurement
was performed with Cell TITER-Glo Luminescent Cell
Viability Assay (Promega) and the luminescence were
measured with Perkin Elmer Victor 2 (GMI). Each test
was conducted in triplicate.

Cell Culture, Reagents, viral transduction and
drug selection
GTL-16 cells, not commercially available, were
a kind gift from Silvia Giordano, University of Torino;
EBC1 cells were obtained from the JCRB cell bank;
Hs746T, NCI-H1993 and NCI-H508 cell lines were
obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC).
Commercial cells were used within 6 months from their
arrival. All cells were regularly authenticated by the
Promega Cell ID system, which is based on sequencing
known STRs (short-tandem repeats). GTL-16, EBC1
and Hs746T cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified
Eagle’s medium (DMEM) (Gibco). NCI-H1993 and
NCI-H508 cell lines were cultured in RPMI-1640 medium
(Gibco). The medium was supplemented with 10% FBS
(Sigma) in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. Human
full length RAF1 cDNA was purchased from RZPD
German Resource Center for Genome Research and cloned
into the pMSCV retroviral vector (Stratagene). Full-length
human BRAF cDNA in retroviral pBabe vector (Addgene)
was a gift by Federica Di Nicolantonio. Retroviral
supernatants were produced in Phoenix Amphotropic
packaging cells. The pMSCV-empty retroviral and
supernatant was used as control. Human truncated RAF1
and BRAF cDNAs were custom-synthesized by Geneart
and cloned into the pRRLsin-PPThCMV-wpre lentiviral
vector [47]. All vectors above described were sequenced
to confirm truncated RAFs cloning. To downregulate
the murine Raf1 transcript, two lentiviral short hairpin
RNAs (shRNA) of the Mission shRNA Target Set
(Sigma) were used, named shRNA-5’ for N-Terminus
portion (TRCN0000055139), shRNA-3’ for C-Terminus
portion (TRCN0000055141) and pLKO.1-puro (cat.
num. SHC001) non silencing control vector. All lentiviral
supernatants were produced by Lipofectamine transfection
of HEK293T cells. Transduction procedures, described
in detail in Supplementary Methods, were followed by
selection with puromycin (2 ng/ml) for retroviral vectors
and hygromycin (400ug/ml) for lentiviral vectors. MET
small-molecule inhibitors for in-vitro assays, PHA665752 and JNJ38877605, were obtained, respectively,
from Sequoia Research Products and Johnson&Johnson;
JNJ38877605 for in-vivo experiments from Timothy
Perera; the EGFR inhibitor Cetuximab from the hospital
pharmacy at our Institution; MEK inhibitor AZD6244
from Sequoia Research Products.

Sequencing of truncated RAFs
To identify RAF1 and BRAF truncation
points in GTL-16 selected cell lines, we generated
PCR products using pFB vector sense primer
5’-GGCTGCCGACCCCGGGGGTGG-3’
and
antisense specific primers for C-terminal of target
transcripts (murine and human RAF1 (NM_029780.3
and NM_002880.3 respectively) and murine Braf
(NM_139294.5) respectively) and we cloned them into
the pCR TOPO vector using the TOPO-TA Cloning Kit
(Invitrogen). Sequencing was performed with TOPO TA
M13 sense primer 5´-GTAAAACGACGGCCAG-3´ and
antisense primer 5’-CAGGAAACAGCTATGAC-3’. All
sequencing experiments were performed by automated
sequencing by ABI Prism 3730 (Applied Biosystems).

Western blotting
For Western blot the following antibodies were
used: polyclonal antibody against human RAF1 (Upstate
- Cat.# 07-396), polyclonal antibody against human and
murine phosphorilated BRAF (Ser445) (Cell Signaling
Technology - Cat.# 2696); monoclonal antibody against
murine Raf1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology - Cat.# sc-7267);
and antibody against vinculin (Sigma - Cat.# V9131). Total
cellular proteins were extracted by solubilizing the cells in
boiling Laemmli buffer followed by sonication. Extracts
were centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 30 min and normalized
with the BCA Protein Assay Reagent Kit (Pierce); 30 μg
of lysates were run on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels,
transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Hybond; GE
Healthcare) and incubated with the antibodies overnight at
4°C. Nitrocellulose-bound antibodies were detected by the
enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) system (Promega).
