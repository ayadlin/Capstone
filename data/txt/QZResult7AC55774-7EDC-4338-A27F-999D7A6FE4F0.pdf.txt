ABSTRACT
High-grade conventional osteosarcoma is the most common primary bone
tumor. Prognosis for osteosarcoma patients is poor and resistance to chemotherapy
is common. We performed an siRNA screen targeting members of the Bcl-2 family
in human osteosarcoma cell lines to identify critical regulators of osteosarcoma cell
survival. Silencing the anti-apoptotic family member Bcl-xL but also the pro-apoptotic
member Bak using a SMARTpool of siRNAs as well as 4/4 individual siRNAs caused
loss of viability. Loss of Bak impaired cell cycle progression and triggered autophagy.
Instead, silencing Bcl-xL induced apoptotic cell death. Bcl-xL was expressed in clinical
osteosarcoma samples but mRNA or protein levels did not significantly correlate with
therapy response or survival. Nevertheless, pharmacological inhibition of a range of
Bcl-2 family members showed that inhibitors targeting Bcl-xL synergistically enhanced
the response to the chemotherapeutic agent, doxorubicin. Indeed, in osteosarcoma
cells strongly expressing Bcl-xL, the Bcl-xL-selective BH3 mimetic, WEHI-539 potently
enhanced apoptosis in the presence of low doses of doxorubicin. Our results identify
Bcl-xL as a candidate drug target for sensitization to chemotherapy in patients with
osteosarcoma.

Apoptosis is a form of programmed cell death,
which requires caspase-mediated proteolysis, and
is governed by the Bcl-2 family. It is essential for
development and tissue homeostasis, and can mediate
cell death upon exposure to pathogens, cytotoxic agents,
or oncogenic stress [6]. The Bcl-2 family includes BH3only proteins (Bim, Puma, Bad, Noxa, Bik, Hrk, Bmf and
tBid), pro-survival proteins (Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Bcl-w, Mcl-1,
Bfl-1, and Bcl-B) and pro-apoptosis proteins (Bax, Bak
and Bok). Bok is primarily localized to ER and Golgi
membranes where it was found to be important for a
proper ER stress response. Its overexpression induces
apoptosis in a manner that is dependent on Bax and Bak
[7]. Bak is localized to mitochondria and Bax resides
in the cytosol. Once Bak and Bax are activated, they
undergo conformational changes and Bax localizes to the
mitochondria. In the mitochondria, Bak and Bax form

INTRODUCTION
Osteosarcoma is the most common primary
malignant bone tumor occurring predominantly in the
second decade of life, and a second peak at middle age.
It is thought to arise from mesenchymal stem cells that
can produce osteoid [1–3]. About 30–40% of the patients
with localized osteosarcoma will relapse mainly by
presenting with lung metastasis. Approximately 10–20%
of the patients present with metastasis at the moment
of diagnosis. Since the introduction of chemotherapy
patients with local disease have 50–60% long-term
survival rate. There has been no significant further
improvement over the past three decades [4]. Following
disease relapse, prognosis is very poor with 23–33%
5-year overall survival despite repeated metastasectomies
when feasible [5].

hetero and oligomers which lead to mitochondrial outer
membrane permeabilization and cytochrome-c release,
which is necessary for caspase activation [8]. Under
normal conditions, the pro-survival Bcl-2 members form
heterodimers with Bax or Bak inhibiting their activation.
However, under cytotoxic stress the activated BH3-only
proteins displace these proteins allowing Bax and Bak
to cause cytochrome-c release from the mitochondria,
caspase cascade activation, and ultimately cell death [8, 9].
Impaired apoptosis is one of the hallmarks of cancer
[10]. It allows cancer cells to tolerate oncogenic stress and
survive in hostile environments such as hypoxic conditions.
Furthermore, defects in apoptosis in cancer cells can
hamper the response to chemotherapy [11]. In this study
we used RNA interference and pharmacological inhibition
to identify members of the Bcl-2 family that control
osteosarcoma cell survival and resistance to chemotherapy.

(Figure 1C). It has been described that failure to
activate apoptosis in Bak/Bax double knockout cells
is accompanied by increased autophagy [13, 14].
Autophagy is a recycling process that provides building
blocks and energy during cell stress while unlimited
autophagy leads to cell death [15]. We first assessed
the knockdown efficiency of Bak in U2OS cells and
confirmed a ~100% efficacy (Figure 2A). Since there
was no caspase 3/7 activation in response to Bak
knockdown, we next determined if the observed loss of
cells was due to slower proliferation. Phospho(ser10)HistoneH3, a marker for cells in mitosis and Ki67, a
marker for proliferating cells were analyzed in cell
lysates and by immunocytochemistry, respectively.
Silencing Bak in U2OS or MOS cells caused a reduction
in phospho(ser10)-HistoneH3 levels (Figure 2B) and
attenuated proliferation was confirmed by reduced Ki67
staining in si-Bak treated cells (Figure 2C).
To assess if Bak depletion triggered autophagy
as shown in other systems [11, 12], we determined the
conjugation of the LC3 protein to phosphatidylethanolamine.
This conjugation represents a critical step in the formation
of the autophagosome, a double-membrane organelle
that engulfs cellular components during autophagy and
subsequently fuses with the lysosome [16]. Silencing
Bak in U2OS and in MOS cells led to accumulation of
the conjugated form of LC3, termed LC3-II (Figure 2D).
Moreover, treatment of U2OS cells in which Bak was
silenced with 10 μM chloroquine for 4 hours (chloroquine
acidifies the phagosome inhibiting its fusion with the
lysosome leading to autophagosome accumulation [17]) led
to further accumulation of LC3 II (Figure 2E). In addition,
immunocytochemistry showed that mitochondria no
longer distributed throughout the cytoplasm but clustered
perinuclearly in Bak-depleted cells where they colocalized
with LC3-marked autophagosomes (Figure 2F). Together,
these findings indicate that depletion of Bak in osteosarcoma
cells induces altered mitochondrial distribution, decreased
proliferation, and autophagy.

RESULTS
Identification of Bcl-xL as a critical pro-survival
factor in osteosarcoma cells
An siRNA screen was performed in U2OS cells to
identify Bcl-2 family members required for osteosarcoma
cell viability (See Supplementary Figure S1 for screen
layout and results). The screen was performed in duplicate
with two negative controls, siGapdh and MOCK (only
transfection reagent), and siKif11 as positive control (all
controls were present in triplicate in each plate). Each
value was normalized to siGapdh, which was set as
100% viability. MOCK transfected cells showed the same
viability as siGapdh. To select hits causing loss of viability
we calculated the standard deviation across each plate,
and determined that a gene was a hit if the SMARTpool
(comprised of 4 single siRNAs targeting the same gene)
and the 4 single siRNAs tested individually, each were
two standard deviations separated from siGapdh. Using
this criteria 7 genes were selected, which included Bcl-B,
Bak, Bid, Bfl-1, Mcl-1, Bok and Bcl-xL (Figure 1A
and 1B). To assess whether loss of viability was due to
apoptosis, a caspase 3/7 assay was performed. Caspase
3 and 7 are effector caspases that once activated, lead to
cell death by cleaving important structural proteins, and
causing DNA fragmentation and membrane blebbing [12].
Bcl-xL knockdown caused the highest caspase3/7 activity
after 48 hours of transfection indicating that it effectively
triggered apoptosis (Figure 1C).

Bcl-xL is expressed in osteosarcoma lung
metastasis
As Bcl-xL silencing caused severe loss of viability
and led to the strongest induction of caspase 3/7 activity,
we decided to further study its role in osteosarcoma.
Others have reported that high Bcl-xL mRNA expression
in osteosarcoma patients is correlated with lower
overall survival rate [18]. We analyzed Bcl-xL mRNA
expression using a previously published microarray data
set of a cohort of 88 osteosarcoma patients but did not
observe significant association with overall survival
(Figure 3A). We next analyzed the expression of BclxL by immunohistochemistry in 60 human primary
osteosarcomas and 23 osteosarcoma lung metastases.
Expression of Bcl-xL was detected in the majority of
osteosarcoma samples and expression was higher in

Silencing Bak leads to autophagy in
osteosarcoma cells
Surprisingly, the screen also identified proapoptotic Bcl-2 family members, including Bak, Bid
and Bok (Figure 1A–1B). A caspase activity assay
indicated that the loss of cell viability caused by
siRNAs targeting these genes was not due to apoptosis

However, contrary to our expectations, high Bcl-xL protein
expression levels (SUM score of intensity and % positive
cells) in primary biopsies correlated with good response to
therapy in this study (>90% necrosis post-chemotherapy)
(Figure 3D). Furthermore, event-free survival rates did
not significantly differ between patients with high and
low Bcl-xL expression in diagnostic biopsies (Figure 3E).
These results indicate that Bcl-xL is expressed in advanced

osteosarcomas, but its expression is not correlated with
poor therapy response or survival.

enhance tumor killing in cases where it is expressed.
Therefore, we assessed whether Bcl-xL represents a
relevant target for osteosarcoma alone or in the context
of conventional chemotherapy. First, four human
osteosarcoma cell lines were treated with ABT-737, a BH3
mimetic that inhibits Bcl-w, Bcl-xL and Bcl-2; of which
only Bcl-xL was identified in the siRNA screen (Figure
1A). In addition, HA14-1, a selective Bcl-2 inhibitor was
tested. All the cell lines showed loss of cell viability in the
10 μM range for ABT-737 and at higher concentrations for
HA14-1 (Figure 4A and 4B). Subsequently, we asked if
these inhibitors, when used at lower concentrations, could
sensitize osteosarcoma cells to chemotherapy. The four
osteosarcoma cell lines were co-treated with a suboptimal
concentration of ABT-737 and a dose range of doxorubicin

for 72 hours. At a concentration of 2.5 μM of ABT-737,
viability of the cells was close to 100%. MOS, U2OS
and to a lesser extent KPD and ZK58 showed increased
sensitivity to treatment with 50–500 nM doxorubicin
under these conditions (Figure 4C). By contrast, treatment
with up to 10 μM of the Bcl-2 selective inhibitor, HA14-1
did not affect sensitivity to doxorubicin. Indeed,
calculation of the deviation from additivity as predicted by
Bliss independence model [19] indicated synergy between
ABT-737 and doxorubicin (Figure 4D).
We next determined if synergy was due to
enhanced apoptosis in the presence of the combination
of ABT-737 and doxorubicin. For this purpose, real time
imaging was used to detect labeled Annexin V binding
to phosphatidylserine, a phospholipid that translocates

to the outer lipid layer of the membrane when cells enter
apoptosis [20]. In agreement with the viability assays
(Figure 4C), ZK58 cells showed significant Annexin V
labeling already in response to 2.5 μM ABT-737 alone
(Figure 5). However, in U2OS and KPD cells exposed to
2.5 μM ABT-737 or 0.1 μM doxorubicin alone, Annexin
V labeling was absent or appeared at late time points after
exposure whereas the combination of 2.5 μM ABT-737
and 0.1 μM doxorubicin caused rapid, strong Annexin
V labeling. Moreover, this enhanced response to the
combination of ABT-737 and chemotherapy was abolished
in the presence of the pan-caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk
(Figure 5). These results indicate that ABT-737, but not
the Bcl-2 selective inhibitor HA 14–1 can sensitize human
osteosarcoma cells to chemotherapy leading to enhanced
apoptosis.

to the other cell lines (Figure 6C). Lastly, we investigated
whether sensitization to doxorubicin in the presence of
WEHI-539 was due to enhanced apoptosis. Indeed, MOS
and U2OS cells exposed to 1 μM WEHI-539 showed
2–3-fold higher induction of caspase 3/7 activity in
response to 0.1 μM doxorubicin, which by itself had little
or no effect (Figure 6D). In agreement with the absence of
synergy observed in KPD and ZK58 (Figure 6B), WEHI539 failed to increase caspase activation in response to
doxorubicin in these cells (Figure 6D). Altogether, these
findings demonstrate that osteosarcoma cells expressing
Bcl-xL can be sensitized to chemotherapy through
pharmacological Bcl-xL inhibition.

DISCUSSION
Patients with metastatic or recurrent osteosarcoma
present low probability of survival mainly due to
resistance to standard chemotherapy [22, 23]. Bcl-2 family
proteins play a crucial role in regulating cell survival/cell
death pathways, and aberrations in their expression or
function mediates tumor development and progression
[24]. Our siRNA screen identifies anti-apoptosis genes
such as Bcl-xL, Mcl-1 and Bfl-1, but interestingly, it
also identified pro-apoptosis genes such as Bak, Bok and
Bid. Autophagy was reported to be enhanced in Bak/Bax
double knockout cells in response to death stimuli such
as radiation and cytotoxic drugs [25, 26]. Others have
associated cell cycle arrest with Bak/Bax double knockout
conditions [27, 28]. We identify both aspects in Baksilenced osteosarcoma cells: the cells proliferate slower
and autophagy is activated. We also notice a recruitment of
mitochondria to the perinuclear area where they colocalize

Inhibition of Bcl-xL with WEHI-539 sensitizes
osteosarcoma to doxorubicin
To further pinpoint the sensitization to chemotherapy
to inhibition of Bcl-xL, we made use of a recently
developed Bcl-xL-selective BH3 mimetic, WEHI-539
[21]. Exposing U2OS and MOS cells to this compound
caused loss of viability at concentrations between 1–10
μM and a similar response was seen in KPD and ZK58
cells at concentrations >10 μM (Figure 6A). Moreover, a
suboptimal dose of 1 μM WEHI-539 effectively enhanced
the response to low doses of doxorubicin in U2OS and
MOS cells but showed no effect in KPD, ZK58, MNNG,
MG-63 and Saos-2. (Figure 6B). This difference could
be attributed to differences in Bcl-xL expression: Bcl-xL
protein levels were high in U2OS and MOS as compared

with autophagosomes, which may point to mitoautophagy.
Alternatively, this may reflect the recent demonstration
that mitochondria can in fact contribute to the formation
of the autophagosome membrane [29].
Bcl-xL expression has been associated with poor
prognosis for patients with colorectal cancer [30] and
hepatocellular carcinoma [31]. In colorectal cancer,
high expression of Bcl-xL correlates with lymph node
metastasis and poorer survival [32]. In melanoma the
expression of Bcl-xL is correlated with tumor thickness
and disease free survival [33], and in follicular lymphoma
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

it is correlated with overall survival [34]. Bcl-xL
expression has also been associated with resistance to
cytotoxic agents in ovarian cancer [35]. Furthermore,
the correlation between Bcl-xL expression and
chemoresistance has been demonstrated in the NCI panel
of 60 cell lines to be independent of p53 status [36].
In osteosarcoma, patients with high Bcl-xL mRNA
levels have been reported to have a lower probability of
5-year overall survival [18]. We were not able to reproduce
such a correlation in our dataset. Moreover, although in
our study Bcl-xL protein was expressed in osteosarcoma
36120

Oncotarget

biopsies and levels were higher in metastases, no
correlation with poor response to chemotherapy was
observed. The reason for this difference between our own
observation and that of others [18] is currently unknown.
Nevertheless, in line with the common role of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family members in cancer resistance to
cytotoxic therapy [37, 38] we find that Bcl-xL inhibition
can sensitize osteosarcoma cells to low dose chemotherapy.
ABT-737, a small molecule inhibitor of Bcl-xL, Bcl2 and Bcl-w, was discovered in 2005 and found to enhance
the cytotoxic effect of chemotherapy and radiation [39].
Studies in myeloma cells [40], myeloid leukemias [41],
neck-squamous cell carcinoma [42], gastrointestinal
stromal tumor cells [43], and chondrosarcoma [38]
indicated that ABT-737 treatment sensitizes to
chemotherapy and other cytotoxic agents [44]. We show
that a similar strategy may be relevant in the context of
human osteosarcoma. However, a major limitation for
translation to the clinic is the fact that ABT-737 is not
orally bioavailable, which limits flexibility of dosing
regimens. ABT-263 is an analogue of ABT-737 with oral
bioavailability, which also potently inhibits Bcl-xL, Bcl-2
and Bcl-w [45]. It has been demonstrated to have little
activity as a single agent in a phase II clinical trial [46] but
to enhance the effect of other cytotoxic agents [47–49].
The Bcl-xL-selective BH3 mimetic, WEHI-539 used in
our current study has shown in vivo toxicity that hinders
further clinical studies. Recently, a related Bcl-xL-selective
inhibitor, A-1155463, has been synthesized lacking the
toxic moiety [50]. Based on our current study, it will be of
particular interest to assess how such a pharmacological
inhibitor affects the sensitivity of chemoresistant
osteosarcomas. High Bcl-xL protein expression as detected
by IHC may serve as a biomarker for treatment with BclxL inhibitors alone or in the presence of chemotherapy.
Such a strategy, would potentially allow reduced dosage
of doxorubicin, thereby decreasing toxicity. Follow up
preclinical studies, for instance using xenograft models,
will have to determine efficacy and toxicity associated with
different concentrations of Bcl-xL inhibitors, doxorubicin,
and combinations. Our findings suggest that such studies
are warranted to open the possibility for further clinical
studies in patients with osteosarcoma.

Immunohistochemistry on tissue microarrays
Two tissue microarrays used in this study were
previously constructed with one was previously published
[3]. The second tissue microarray consisted of 73 FFPE
biopsies, resections and metastases mainly from high
grade conventional osteosarcomas. All specimens in this
study were handled according to the ethical guidelines
described in ‘Code for Proper Secondary Use of Human
Tissue in The Netherlands’ of the Dutch Federation of
Medical Scientific Societies. The slide was deparaffinized,
rehydrated and blocked of endogenouse peroxidase.
Subsequently, antigen retrieval was performed with citrate
pH 6.0. Incubation with antibody was overnight at 4°C at
a 1:1000 dilution. As a second step we used Immunologic
Poly-HRP-GAM/R/R IgG (DVPO110HRP) and Dako
liquid DAB+ Substrate Chromogen System (K3468),
followed by counterstaining with hematoxylin. Testis tissue
was used as control. Slides were scored independently
by two observers (JVMGB and YJ). Staining intensity
(0 = absent, 1 = weak, 2 = moderate, 3 = strong) and
extent of the staining (0 = 0%, 1 = 1–24%, 2 = 25–49%,
3 = 50–74% and 4 = 75–100%) were assessed. The two
values were added to obtain sum scores. Cores where the
tissue was lost were excluded from the analysis. To assess
response to chemotherapy, patients were divided among
good and poor responders. The histological response was
assessed by determining the amount of necrotic tissue
in the resection specimen obtained after chemotherapy.
Response was considered good when a patient presented
more than 90% necrotic tissue in the tumor, and bad
responders were those with less than 90% necrosis [51].

Cell culture
Human osteosarcoma cell lines MOS, U2OS,
143B, ZK58, KPD, MNNG, MG-63 and Saos-2 were
previously described [52, 53]. Cells were grown in
RPMI1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum and 25 U/mL penicillin and 25 μg/mL of penicillinstreptomycin. All cells were cultured in a humidified
incubator at 37°C with 5% CO2.

siRNA transfection reagent by reverse transfection according
to the manufacturer’s procedures (Polyplus transfection,
Leusden, Netherlands). The transfection was performed in
u-clear 96-well plates from Corning. Nineteen Bcl-2 family
members were targeted with a SMARTpool comprised of 4
different siRNAs and with each single siRNA individually.
After 24 hours of transfection the medium was refreshed and
the cells were further incubated for 72 hours. Alamar Blue
was acquired from Thermo Fisher Scientific (Bleiswijk, The
Netherlands) and used to assess viability as specified by the
manufacturer. Fluorescence was measured with a FluoStar
Optima plate reader.

For cell viability assays (excluding the siRNA
screen), cells were processed using the ATPlite 1Step
kit (Perkin Elmer) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions, followed by luminescence measurement in a
Fluostar Optima plate reader. Apoptosis was assessed by
Annexin V staining and Caspase Glo3/7 (Promega). For
real time Annexin V binding assays, cells were co-exposed
to drugs and Annexin V in a u-clear 96-well plate, and
imaged every hour, for 66 hours. Images were obtained
using a BD Pathway 855, then converted to videos, and
Annexin V staining was quantified by an in-house macro
for Image-Pro Analyzer 7.0 as previously described [20].
For caspase 3/7 activity measurements, cells were exposed
to the drug for 24 hours after which the reagent was added
1:1. Luminescence was measured in a Fluostar Optima
plate reader.

Microarray data analysis
Gene expression profiles were obtained from a
previously published microarray data set [54]. Using the
Bioconductor lumi package, data was transformed with
the variance stabilizing transformation algorithm and
normalized with the robust spline normalization algorithm.
Probe_ID identifiers from the Illumina Annotation
for Illumina human-6 v2.0 expression beadchip were
used as reporters (Bcl-xL reporter = ILMN_1654118).
Kaplan Meier curves were created from the entry “Mixed
Osteosarcoma-Kuijer-127-vst-ilmnhwg6v2” in the web
application R2 (http://r2.amc.nl).

Synergy assessment
To assess synergy, we used the Bliss independence
model, which defines to what extent the effect of a drug
at a certain concentration is independent of the presence
of the other drug at a certain concentration [55]. This
model predicts the combined response C for two single
compounds with effects A and B: C = A+B – A*B [56].

Immunoblotting

Statistical analysis

Cells were lysed with SDS protein buffer (125
mM Tris/HCl pH 6.8, 20% glycerol, 4% SDS and 0.2%
bromophenol blue). Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE
and transferred to polyvinylidine difluoride membrane.
Membranes were blocked in 5% BSA-TBST (TRIS0.05% Tween20), followed by overnight incubation with
primary antibodies and 45 minutes incubation with HRPconjugated secondary antibodies. Chemoluminescence
was detected with the bioimager LAS400 (GE Healthcare).

Dose response curve fitting and all statistical
analyses were performed with GraphPad Prism 5.0
(GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA). The unpaired and
paired two-tailed t-test used to compare groups in Figure
3B and 3D was performed with IBM SPSS statistics
20. Event free survival was computed from the date of
diagnosis until first recurrence, either local or metastatic.
Tumors were divided into two groups, having low (mean
sum score ≤ 3) or high Bcl-xL expression (mean sum score
> 3). Event free survival in both groups was compared
using the Kaplan-Meier method and the Log-rank test with
IBM SPSS statistics 20.

Immunostaining
MOS and U2OS cells were transfected with siRNA
as previously described. The cells were fixed 48 hours
after transfection with ice cold methanol for 15 minutes,
and were subsequently rinsed 3 times for 5 minutes with
PBS. Afterwards, the cells were incubated with blocking
solution [10% normal goat serum, 0.3%Triton100 in PBS]
for 1 hour, rinsed 3 times for 5 minutes with PBS, and
then incubated 1 hour with second antibody(1:300). Nuclei
stainig with Hoechst 33342 was performed as a final step
together with the rinsing steps. The antibodies were diluted
in antibody staining solution [1%BSA, 0.3%Triton100 in
PBS]. The cells probed mitochondria, were exposed to 75
nM of MitoTracker® Red CMX Ros (from Cell Signaling)
for 45 minutes previous to fixation. All images were taken
with confocal microscope Eclipse Ti-E from Nikon.
