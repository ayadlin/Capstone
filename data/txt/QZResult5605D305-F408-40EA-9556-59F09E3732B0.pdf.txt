BACKGROUND: Upper gastrointestinal adenocarcinomas (UGCs) respond poorly to current chemotherapeutic regimes. The authors
and others have previously reported frequent Aurora kinase A (AURKA) gene amplification and mRNA and protein overexpression in
UGCs. The objective of the current study was to determine the therapeutic potential of alisertib (MLN8237) alone and in combination
with docetaxel in UGCs. METHODS: After treatment with alisertib and/or docetaxel, clonogenic cell survival, cell cycle analyses, Western blot analyses, and tumor xenograft growth assays were carried out to measure cell survival, cell cycle progression, apoptotic protein expression, and tumor xenograft volumes, respectively. RESULTS: By using the AGS, FLO-1, and OE33 UGC cell lines, which have
constitutive AURKA overexpression and variable tumor protein 53 (p53) status, significantly enhanced inhibition of cancer cell survival was observed with alisertib and docetaxel treatment in combination (P < .001), compared with single-agent treatments. Cell
cycle analyses, after 48 hours of treatment with alisertib, produced a significant increase in the percentage of polyploidy in UGC cells
(P < .01) that was further enhanced by docetaxel (P < .001). In addition, an increase in the percentage of cells in sub-G1-phase
observed with alisertib (P < .01) was significantly enhanced with the combination treatment (P < .001). Western blot analysis demonstrated higher induction of cleaved caspase 3 protein expression with the combined treatment compared with single-agent treatments. In addition, FLO-1 and OE33 cell xenograft models demonstrated enhanced antitumor activity for the alisertib and docetaxel
combination compared with single-agent treatments (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: The current study demonstrated that alisertib comC 2012 American Cancer

INTRODUCTION
Upper gastrointestinal adenocarcinomas (UGCs) (ie, adenocarcinomas of the stomach and esophagus) are associated with
poor patient survival rate because of inherent resistance to current therapeutic regimens.1,2 Global epidemiologic data
indicate that approximately 1.4 million new UGCs are diagnosed annually, resulting in approximately 1.1 million
deaths.3 Over the past several decades, the incidence rates for distal gastric cancers have declined; however, incidence rates
for adenocarcinoma of the gastric cardia, gastroesophageal (GE) junction, and esophagus continue to rise.3,4
Multiple prosurvival and drug-resistant genes, such as the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2), v-Ki-ras2 Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (K-RAS), and Aurora
kinase A (AURKA), mediate oncogenic signaling pathways in gastric and esophageal adenocarcinomas.5-9 Despite the
availability of several adjuvant and neoadjuvant chemotherapeutic treatment strategies, the survival rate for patients
with UGCs have only marginally improved.10 Therefore, laboratory investigations and preclinical studies specifically
aimed at developing novel targeted therapies and chemotherapeutic combinations with potent antitumor activity are
desperately needed to treat patients with UGCs.
We and others previously reported the amplification of the region of band 13 on the long arm of chromosome 20
(20q13) in UGC.11,12 The 20q13 chromosomal region harbors the AURKA gene, which is frequently amplified and/or
overexpressed in several malignancies, including cancers of the bladder, breast, colon, liver, ovaries, pancreas, stomach,
and esophagus.8,13 AURKA is a key cell cycle regulator that is critical for mitotic events.14,15 However, when

overexpressed, AURKA is a bona fide oncogene and
results in genetic instability, dedifferentiated morphology, and a poor prognosis in patients with UGCs.6,16
The overexpression of AURKA promotes cancer cell
growth and resistance to chemotherapy by up-regulating
oncogenic signaling pathways and suppressing cell-death
mechanisms, respectively.13 In addition, AURKA overexpression induces growth-promoting and survivalpromoting oncogenic signaling pathways, such as the
phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/AKT)
and b-catenin pathways, in UGC cancer cells.13 The
docetaxel, cisplatin, and 5-fluorouracil (DCF) chemotherapy regimen is 1 of the most efficacious chemotherapeutic regimens against advanced gastric cancer.17 It is
noteworthy that AURKA overexpression reportedly
mediates resistance against paclitaxel and cisplatininduced cell death.18,19 The cell-death mechanisms,
which are regulated by the tumor protein 53 (p53) family
of proapoptotic proteins, are activated in cancer cells after
treatment with chemotherapeutic agents. However,
mutations in the p53 function are frequently observed in
UGCs. In p53-mutant cancers, the related tumor protein
73 (p73) can mediate p53-like apoptotic functions and
activate apoptotic pathways after treatment with chemotherapeutic agents.20 Also noteworthy is the fact that
AURKA overexpression in cancer suppresses p53 and
p73 protein expression and function.21,22 These findings
suggest that p53-mutant UGCs with constitutively higher
levels of AURKA expression can respond poorly to chemotherapy. Therefore, given the poor response of UGCs to
current therapeutic regimens; novel therapeutic strategies
that take into account the molecular make-up of tumors
to activate cell death response are critically needed to
combat UGCs.
Alisertib (MLN8237) is an investigational small molecule inhibitor developed by Millennium Pharmaceuticals,
Inc. (Cambridge, Mass.) that has demonstrated the ability
to selectively inhibit AURKA and thereby induce cell cycle
arrest, aneuploidy, polyploidy, mitotic catastrophe, and cell
death.8,23 Currently, alisertib is being tested in various
phase 1, 2, and 3 clinical trials for advanced solid tumors
and hematologic malignancies (http://clinicaltrials.gov/;
Accessed August 26, 2012). In addition, multiple clinical
trials have indicated that docetaxel and its combination
with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil have significant antitumor
activity in UGCs.17 Docetaxel is a microtubule-polymerizing chemotherapeutic agent that disrupts microtubule dynamics by binding to the b-subunit of tubulin and
promoting its polymerization.24 Consequently, docetaxel
causes cell cycle arrest in mitosis and subsequently induces

apoptosis. In the current study, we investigated the potential therapeutic benefit of alisertib alone and in combination with docetaxel using in vitro and in vivo cell models of
UGC with variable p53 status. We hypothesized that the
alisertib and docetaxel combination treatment would cause
enhanced cell cycle arrest, resulting in polyploidy and subsequent induction of apoptosis in UGC cancer cells, irrespective of their p53 status.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell Culture and Pharmacologic Reagents

The AGS (p53 wild type) gastric adenocarcinoma cell line
and the FLO-1/OE33 (p53 mutant) esophageal adenocarcinoma cell lines were maintained as a monolayer culture
in Dulbecco modified Eagle medium (DMEM) (Gibco,
Carlsbad, Calif) cell culture medium supplemented
with 10% (volume/volume) fetal bovine serum (FBS)
(Gibco).25 All cell lines were evaluated weekly to ascertain
conformity to the appropriate in vitro morphologic
characteristics.26 MLN8237 (alisertib) was provided by
Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc., and alisertib stock
solutions for in vitro and in vivo studies were prepared
according to our previously reported methods.8 Docetaxel
(Sanofi Aventis, Bridgewater, NJ) stock solution (11.6
mM) prepared in 13% ethanol (volume/volume) was provided by the TVC Outpatient Pharmacy at Vanderbilt
University Medical Center (Nashville, Tenn).
Clonogenic Cell Survival Assay

AGS, FLO-1 and OE33 cells were seeded at 5000 cells
per well, respectively, onto 6-well plates overnight and
then were treated with various concentrations of alisertib
(0.25 lM, 0.5 lM, 1.0 lM, 2.0 lM, and 5.0 lM) for 24
hours. After treatment, UGC cell survival was determined
according to our previously reported protocol.8 Briefly,
after treatment, the cells were incubated in drug-free cell
culture medium for 10 days. Subsequently, the cells were
fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde solution, stained with
crystal violet dye solution, and cell survival was quantified
by measuring the dye signal in each well using ImageJ
analysis software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda,
Md). In addition, we selected an alisertib dose close to the
50% inhibitory concentration (0.5 lM) and treated the
cells with alisertib (0.5 lM) and/or with docetaxel (0.5
nM, 1.0 nM, or 5.0 nM) for 24 hours.
Cell Cycle Analysis

AGS and FLO-1 cells were treated with alisertib (0.1
lM) and/or docetaxel (0.5 nM) in cell culture medium
(2.5% FBS) for 24 hours and 48 hours, respectively.
OE33 cells were treated with alisertib (0.5 lM) and/or
905

Original Article

docetaxel (1.0 nM) in cell culture medium (2.5% FBS)
for 24 hours and 48 hours, respectively. After treatment,
supernatant media was collected, and adherent cells were
trypsinized. The supernatant and trypsinized cells were
centrifuged together at 2000g at 4 C for 10 minutes.
Then, the cells were resuspended in 1 mL propidium
iodide (PI) solution (PI 50 lg/mL and RNase 1 lg/mL
in 1  phosphate-buffered saline) and incubated at room
temperature in the dark for 30 minutes. Subsequently,
the cells were analyzed with the BD LSR III flow
cytometer (BD Biosciences, San Jose, Calif), and the
data were processed with BD FACS Diva software (BD
Biosciences) at the VMC Flow Cytometry Shared
Resource, Vanderbilt Ingram Cancer Center.
Western Blot Analysis

AGS, FLO-1, and OE33 cancer cells were plated overnight at 30% confluence in cell culture medium (10%
FBS). AGS cells were treated with alisertib (0.25 lM)
and/or docetaxel (1.0 nM), FLO-1 cells were treated with
alisertib (0.1 lM) and/or docetaxel (0.5 nM), and OE33
cells were treated with alisertib (0.5 lM) and/or docetaxel
(1.0 nM) for 48 hours in cell culture medium supplemented with 2.5% FBS. After treatment, cell lysates were
prepared and evaluated for total and phosphorylated (p-)
proteins; p-AURKA (threonine 288), AURKA, cleaved
caspase 3, and b-actin (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, Mass), according to standard protocols.27
In Vivo Tumor Xenograft Inhibition

Four million FLO-1 or OE33 cells suspended in a 200lL DMEM-Matrigel mixture (50% DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 50% Matrigel) were injected
into the flank regions of female athymic nude-Foxn1 nu/
nu mice (Harlan Laboratories Inc., Indianapolis, Ind).
The tumors were allowed to grow until they measured
200 mm3 in size before the treatment was started with
daily alisertib (30 mg/kg, orally) and/or once-weekly
docetaxel (10 mg/kg as an intraperitoneal injection) for 3
weeks. Tumor xenografts were measured every alternate
day, and tumor size was calculated according to the following formula: Tvol ¼ LW2  0.5, in which Tvol is tumor volume, L is tumor length, and W is tumor width.23
Immunohistochemistry

After 21 days of animal treatment, the tumors were isolated, and an immunohistochemical analysis was carried
out to measure Ki-67 and cleaved caspase 3 protein
expression levels, as previously reported.8 Protein expression was scored using a composite expression score (CES)
that was determined by using the formula ‘‘CES ¼ 4(intensity  1) þ frequency,’’ as described previously, with
906

intensity measured on a scale from 0 to 3 and frequency
measured on a scale from 0 to 4.28
Statistical Analysis

Data are presented as means  standard error of the
mean (SEM). All in vitro experiments were performed in
triplicate. A 1-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with
Tukey post hoc analysis was used to demonstrate statistical differences between control groups and treatment
groups at the treatment endpoints. A 2way ANOVA with
Bonferroni post hoc analysis was used to demonstrate statistical differences between various treatment groups and
cell cycle stages. For tumor xenograft data, a 2-way
ANOVA (time point-matched analysis) with Bonferroni
post-test was used to compare the ‘‘mean tumor size’’ of a
treatment group on any given treatment day with the
‘‘mean tumor size’’ of another other treatment groups on
the corresponding treatment day. All statistical analyses
described above were carried out using GraphPad Prism
5 software (GraphPad Software Inc., La Jolla, Calif). All
P values  .05 were considered statistically significant
and are marked in the figures, in which a single asterisk
indicates P < .05, and double asterisks indicate P < .01.
RESULTS
Alisertib Significantly Enhanced
Docetaxel-Mediated Inhibition of Cell Survival

Both FLO1 and OE33 cell lines exhibited gene amplification and overexpression of AURKA at the mRNA and
protein levels.8,29 Similarly, AGS cells exhibited an
increase in AURKA DNA copy number (2.26-fold) and
mRNA level (4.98-fold; data not shown). Therefore, these
cell models mimic the previously reported in vivo data on
AURKA overexpression in primary UGCs.30 The clonogenic cell-survival assay data indicated that alisertib (0.5
lM) or docetaxel (1.0 nM) as single-agent treatments
decreased the percentage of AGS cells that survived (alisertib 0.5 lM: 45.5%  4.6% AGS cell survival [mean 

Treatment with the alisertib (0.5 lM) and docetaxel (1.0

alone or in combination with docetaxel for 24 hours significantly reduced the percentage of cells in G1-phase and
S-phase and induced a significant delay in the transition
from G2-phase to M-phase in AGS and OE33 cells
(Figs. 2A, 3C). The 24-hour treatment with alisertib alone
had a similar effect on G1-phase, S-phase, and the G2phase to M-phase transition in FLO-1 cells; however, this
effect was significantly more pronounced after 24 hours of
combined treatment with combined alisertib and docetaxel (Fig. 3A). In addition, treatment with alisertib alone
for 24 hours significantly increased the percentage of polyploid cells, which was enhanced further by combined alisertib and docetaxel treatment in AGS and FLO-1 cells
(Figs. 2A, 3A). At the 48-hour time point, FLO-1 cells
with that were treated with either alisertib or docetaxel as
a single-agent demonstrated an increase in the percentage
of cells in sub-G1-phase (P < .05) (Fig. 3B). This effect
was significantly enhanced in FLO-1 cells that received

the combined treatment (P < .01) (Fig. 3B). The cell
cycle analyses indicate that FLO-1 cells were more sensitive to alisertib and/or docetaxel treatments, as evidenced
by an increase in the number of cells in sub-G1-phase after 24-hour and 48-hour treatment. In addition, 48-hour
treatment with alisertib and docetaxel enhanced polyploidy in AGS and OE33 UGC cells. These findings are
in agreement with previously published reports, in which
investigators observed that docetaxel-induced microtubule stabilization impaired mitosis, generating aneuploid
and tetraploid cells that subsequently underwent apoptotic cell death.24,31,32 Our data suggest that the combination treatment promotes polyploidy early on and,
depending on the cell line, polyploidy likely leads to cell
death (sub-G1) either early on (FLO-1 cells) or at later
time points (AGS and OE33 cells). These findings provide a plausible explanation and support for the clonogenic cell survival assay results that measured long-term

cleaved caspase 3, a common apoptosis marker, a finding
that was enhanced significantly after combined treatment
with alisertib and docetaxel for 48 hours (Fig. 4). These
results support our hypothesis that alisertib can significantly enhance docetaxel-induced apoptosis in UGCs.

and OE33 cells (alisertib: 101.4%  5.6%; P < .01; docetaxel: 44.1%  3.1%; P < .01). Compared with these single-agent treatments, combined treatment with alisertib

results (Fig. 5), these immunostaining patterns were more
significant with the combined treatment (P < .01) than
with the single-agent treatments (P < .05) (Fig. 6). Therefore, the in vivo data indicate that combined treatment
with alisertib and docetaxel has enhanced antitumor activity in UGC tumor xenograft models.
DISCUSSION
Despite novel therapeutic advancements, improvement in
the survival rate of patients with UGC has been marginal,
suggesting the presence of unique, active, intrinsic mechanisms that impart resistance to chemotherapeutic agents
in UGCs.33,34 AURKA is frequently overexpressed and/or
amplified in various cancers, including UGCs.8,13 Recent
reports suggest that AURKA can induce chemotherapeutic resistance and regulate several key signaling pathways
in cancer cells, suggesting its role as a central node in cancer cell signaling.13 Docetaxel has demonstrated significant in vitro and in vivo antitumor activity against a
variety of UGC cell lines.35
In the current study, we used UGC cell lines to
determine the therapeutic response of the recently developed AURKA selective inhibitor alisertib as a single agent
and in combination with docetaxel. Although previous in
vitro studies with Aurora kinase inhibitors have demonstrated their antitumor activity in combination with other
910

chemotherapeutic agents, such as cisplatin, docetaxel,
nilotinib, and vorinostat,8,36-38 alisertib, an investigational small-molecule AURKA inhibitor currently in clinical development, has not been tested in combination
with docetaxel in gastrointestinal cancer models. In this
regard, our current results suggest a potential therapeutic
benefit of combined treatment with alisertib and
docetaxel.
The p53 gene is frequently mutated in various
cancers in which p53-mutant tumors exhibit inherent
resistance to several chemotherapeutic drugs.39 This is of
particular significance in UGC therapeutics; because, in
addition to AURKA overexpression, a high frequency of
defective p53 signaling caused by mutation or deletion is
observed in UGCs, presenting a formidable clinical challenge.40 In this study, we used p53-mutant (FLO-1 and
OE33) and wild-type (AGS) cell lines and obtained similar results. It is noteworthy that both in vitro and in vivo
models suggested a promising therapeutic potential for
the alisertib and docetaxel combination, as indicated by
suppressed cell survival in vitro (P < .001) and significant
regression of tumor growth in vivo (P < .001). On the basis of our findings, we suggest that AURKA-targeted therapy, either alone or in combination with docetaxel, is
effective independent of p53 status. Our data indicate
that the therapeutic effect is largely because of the induction of aberrant mitosis, leading to polyploidy and
subsequent apoptosis. However, others factors, such as

suppressed proliferation and nonapoptotic forms of cell
death, also may be occurring. These findings are timely
given the finding that alisertib is being tested actively in
various phase 1, 2, and 3 clinical trials (http://clinicaltrials.gov/; [accessed August 26, 2012]).
AURKA is a serine/threonine kinase that facilitates
accurate mitosis by regulating vital cell cycle events during
various stages of mitosis.14,15 It has been demonstrated
that AURKA inhibition induces aneuploidy, polyploidy,
and mitotic catastrophe in cells.36 After treatment with
alisertib, we observed a significant increase in the percentage of cells with polyploidy. This suggests that mitotic catastrophe remains 1 of the predominant functions of
alisertib, a finding that is in agreement with previously
published data.8,36 Docetaxel-based combination chemotherapeutic regimens like DCF are widely used for the
treatment of advanced gastric cancers.17 Docetaxelinduced defects in spindle formation and function (tubuCancer

lin polymerization) activate the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) and subsequently result in aneuploidy,
polyploidy, and/or apoptosis.24 It is worth noting previous reports that AURKA overexpression was able to override the SAC and impart resistance to paclitaxel in HEK293 cells, suggesting that AURKA overexpression is critical for resistance to cell cycle inhibitors.19 Treatment with
docetaxel increased the percentage of cells in the sub-G1phase, indicating late-stage cell death, which conforms to
the finding that docetaxel-induced spindle defects activate
SAC, which subsequently activates apoptotic pathways.24
Treatment with alisertib alone and in combination with
docetaxel induced G2-M-phase arrest in vitro. It is known
that AURKA regulates G2-phase to M-phase transitions,
and its inhibition should result in G2/M-phase arrest.41
At low treatment concentrations, docetaxel-induced SAC
is transient and weak, an effect that can be easily overridden by overexpressed AURKA, as previously reported in
911

cleaved caspase 3 expression. (A) The data indicate that combined treatment with MLN (30 mg/kg) and DOCE (10 mg/kg) significantly inhibited Ki-67 expression in FLO-1 tumor xenografts. C indicates control. (B) Combination treatment with MLN (30
mg/kg) and DOCE (10 mg/kg) exhibited enhanced cleaved caspase 3 protein expression in FLO-1 tumor xenografts. A single asterisk indicates P < .05; double asterisks; P < .01.

HeLa cells.19 However, alisertib-mediated specific inhibition of AURKA may sensitize AURKA-overexpressing
cells to docetaxel, resulting in prolonged activation of
SAC that is subsequently translated into accelerated mitotic slippage, polyploidy, and cell death.31 After a short,
48-hour treatment, our results demonstrated an increase
in the percentage of polyploid cells in AGS and OE33
cells, whereas an increase in apoptotic cells was observed
in FLO-1 cells. These data suggest that FLO-1 cells are
relatively more sensitive to AURKA inhibition compared
with AGS and OE33 cells when treated with alisertib
alone, an effect that is further enhanced by docetaxel.

Although treatment of AGS and OE33 cells with docetaxel alone for 48 hours increased the percentage of apoptotic sub-G1-phase cells, even higher percentages of
polyploid cells were always observed after treatment with
combined alisertib and docetaxel. It is well documented
that combination chemotherapy is a common and effective therapeutic approach in the treatment of UGCs.17 In
our study, combined alisertib and docetaxel treatment
induced a higher percentage of polyploidy that, subsequently, resulted in increased apoptosis, as indicated by
the significantly enhanced expression of cleaved caspase 3
protein levels in AGS, FLO-1, and OE33 cells. In

addition, compared with single-agent treatments, the
combination treatment significantly reduced Ki-67 levels
and enhanced cleaved caspase 3 protein levels in tumor
xenografts, providing additional evidence of the improved
antitumor activity of this regimen.
In conclusion, the combination of alisertib and
docetaxel results in significantly enhanced antitumor
activity in cell line models, possibly mediated by apoptotic pathways induced after the activation of SAC. Thus,
as clinical trials for alisertib are being actively conducted,
our current findings provide a credible rationale for
evaluating AURKA-targeted therapy in combination
with docetaxel as a therapeutic approach for the treatment of UGCs.
