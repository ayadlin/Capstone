BACKGROUND: The objectives of this study were to assess the incidence of clinical allergy and end-induction antiasparaginase (antiASNase) antibodies in children with high-risk acute lymphoblastic leukemia treated with pegylated (PEG) Escherichia coli ASNase
and to determine whether they carry any prognostic significance. METHODS: Of 2057 eligible patients, 1155 were allocated to augmented arms in which PEG ASNase replaced native ASNase postinduction. Erwinia chrysanthemi (Erwinia) ASNase could be used to
replace native ASNase after allergy, if available. Allergy and survival data were complete for 990 patients. End-induction antibody
titers were available for 600 patients. RESULTS: During the consolidation phase, 289 of 990 patients (29.2%) had an allergic reaction.
There were fewer allergic reactions to Erwinia ASNase than to native ASNase (odds ratio, 4.33; P <.0001) or PEG ASNase (odds ratio,
3.08; P <.0001) only during phase 1 of interim maintenance. There was no significant difference in 5-year event-free survival (EFS)
between patients who received PEG ASNase throughout the entire study postinduction versus those who developed an allergic reaction to PEG ASNase during consolidation phase and subsequently received Erwinia ASNase (80.8% 6 2.8% and 81.6% 6 3.8%, respectively; P 5.66). Patients who had positive antibody titers postinduction were more likely to have an allergic reaction to PEG ASNase
(odds ratio, 2.4; P <.001). The 5-year EFS rate between patients who had negative versus positive antibody titers (80% 6 2.6% and
77.7% 6 4.3%, respectively; P 5.68) and between patients who did not receive any ASNase postconsolidation and those who received
PEG ASNase throughout the study (P 5.22) were significantly different. CONCLUSIONS: The current results demonstrate differences
in the incidence rates of toxicity between ASNase preparations but not in EFS. The presence of anti-ASNase antibodies did not affect

INTRODUCTION
Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common cancer in children. Currently, cure rates surpass 85%.1 Asparaginase (ASNase) is an enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of the amino acid asparagine into aspartic acid and ammonia
and has been a key chemotherapeutic agent in the treatment of ALL for more than 40 years. The first use of ASNase in
treating children with ALL was reported in 1966, and the first use of ASNase derived from Escherichia coli was reported in
1967.2-4 It has been a mainstay of therapy ever since.
Despite the vast experience with ASNase, questions remain regarding the optimal preparation, dose, and dosing
schedule. L-asparaginase comes from 2 bacterial sources, E. coli (native ASNase, Elspar; Lundbeck, Deerfield, Ill) and
Erwinia chrysanthemi (Erwinia ASNase, Erwinase; Speywood Laboratories, Maidenhead, UK). Pegylation (PEG) of
native ASNase (PEG ASNase, Oncaspar; Sigma-Tau Pharmaceuticals, Gaithersburg, Md) decreases proteolysis, increases
drug half-life, and decreases immunogenicity with at least equivalent efficacy at an appropriate dose and schedule.5,6 It has
been demonstrated in 2 large, multiinstitutional, cooperative group trials that Erwinia ASNase has less toxicity but inferior

part by the shorter half-life of Erwinia ASNase.7,8
Herein, we report the experience of patients treated
on arms containing PEG ASNase from a Children’s Cancer Group (CCG) trial (Treatment of Patients With Acute
Lymphoblastic Leukemia With Unfavorable Features;
CCG-1961). We describe associations of allergic reactions
and anti-ASNase antibodies as well as different preparations of ASNase with event-free survival (EFS). To our
knowledge, this represents the largest cohort of PEG
ASNase-treated patients reported to date.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Between November 1996 and May 2002, 2057 eligible
patients with newly diagnosed, high-risk ALL were enrolled onto CCG-1961. The patient characteristics of this
cohort and treatment details were previously published.9
High-risk status was determined according to standard
National Cancer Institute (NCI) criteria and included
patients who were either older than 10 years or had a
white blood cell count >50,000 cells/lL. All patients
received a standard 4-drug induction that included intramuscular native ASNase. Patients who had <25% blasts
in a day-7 bone marrow aspirate were considered
rapid early responders and were randomized to receive either standard-intensity and standard-duration (arm A),
standard-intensity and increased-duration (arm B),
increased-intensity and standard-duration (arm C), or
increased-intensity and increased-duration (arm D) postinduction therapy. All slow early responders (those who
had a day-7 bone marrow aspirate with 25% blasts)
received increased-intensity and increased-duration postinduction intensification and also were randomized to
receive cyclophosphamide and either doxorubicin or idarubicin. Patients who were randomized to the increasedintensity arms were assigned 6 or 10 doses (arms C and D,
respectively) of intramuscular PEG ASNase postinduction (n 5 1155). The NCI and the institutional review
boards of the participating institutions approved this protocol. Informed consent was obtained from the patients,
their parents, or both before starting therapy.
Of 2057 eligible patients enrolled on CCG-1961,
1067 patients were excluded from analyses for the following reasons: Philadelphia chromosome-positive disease,
missing data on reaction status, or randomization to a
standard-intensity arm. Data were complete for
990 patients in the PEG ASNase-containing arms
who received single monthly doses of PEG ASNase
(2500 IU/m2 per dose) during postinduction courses
4206

before maintenance therapy. Patients received native
ASNase (6000 IU/m2 per dose 3 6 per single dose of
PEG ASNase) when PEG ASNase was unavailable.
Patients who had adverse reactions to PEG ASNase or
native ASNase received Erwinia ASNase (10,000 IU/m2
per dose every other day 3 6 doses per dose of PEG
ASNase).
Institutions were required to submit details for all
patients who experienced a reaction to any form of
ASNase, defined according to CCG Toxicity and Complications Criteria, which are based on NCI Common
Toxicity Criteria. According to the protocol, patient serum samples were collected at the end of induction and
before delayed intensification phase 1 and maintenance to
determine the presence of anti-ASNase antibodies. The
methodology and definitions of positive and negative
antibody titers have been previously published.10
First, we analyzed the incidence of allergic reactions
to the 3 different forms of ASNase for patients enrolled on
PEG ASNase-containing arms (arm 1). Then, allergic reactions to PEG ASNase were correlated with the presence or
absence of end-induction anti-ASNase antibodies (arm 2).
Because we believed that patients with high anti-ASNase
antibody titers would be more likely to react to PEG
ASNase exposure during the consolidation phase, a subanalysis was performed to examine patients who had positive
end-induction antibodies and allergic reactions to PEG
ASNase limited to the consolidation phase only. Next,
end-induction anti-ASNase antibodies were correlated
with EFS (arm 3). To determine whether patients who
developed a severe allergic reaction to PEG ASNase could
receive Erwinia ASNase as a substitute, we compared the
EFS of patients who received PEG ASNase throughout the
study and had no allergic reaction with the EFS of patients
who developed an allergic reaction to PEG ASNase during
consolidation phase and subsequently received Erwinia
ASNase as a substitute (arm 4). Last, because a significant
minority of patients did not receive any ASNase after consolidation because of a severe adverse event, the EFS of
patients who received PEG ASNase throughout the study
was compared with that of patients who received PEG
ASNase during consolidation phase only and did not
receive any form of ASNase thereafter (arm 5).
Statistical Methods

Study data for outcome analyses were frozen on March 28,
2008. All analyses were restricted to patients who were enrolled on the CCG-1961 treatment arms that contained
PEG ASNase. EFS was defined as the time from randomization to either the first event (failure to achieve remission,

Estimates for EFS were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier
method, and standard errors of the estimates were obtained
using the method of Peto and Peto.11 The log-rank test was
used to compare survival curves among groups. Odds ratios
(ORs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated. Chi-square tests were used to analyze categorical
variables. Statistical significance was defined as P < .05. All
analyses were performed using SAS software (IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY). All graphics were generated using

RESULTS
Incidence of Allergic Reactions by Phase

The total number of patients who received 3 different
forms of ASNase and the incidence of allergic reactions
during each phase is summarized in Table 1. The likelihood of allergic reactions was similar with PEG ASNase,
native ASNase, and Erwinia ASNase during all phases of
therapy, with the exception of interim maintenance phase
1, in which the incidence of an allergic reaction to Erwinia
ASNase was less likely than that for both native ASNase

End-Induction Anti-ASNase Antibody Status
and Allergic Reactions to PEG ASNase

Of 600 patients who had antibody data available at the
end of induction, 340 received PEG ASNase during subsequent phases. There were 97 patients (28.5%) with a
positive antibody titer (>1.1) and 243 (71.5%) with a
negative antibody titer (1.1). Patients who had a positive antibody titer were 2.41 times more likely to have an
allergic reaction to PEG ASNase postinduction than
patients who had a negative antibody titer (OR, 2.41;
95% CI, 1.49-3.89; P < .001). It is noteworthy that there
were no significant demographic differences between
patients who had antibody data and those who did not
(Supporting Tables 1-4; see online supporting information), and this was consistent with patient demographic
information reported for the entire study population.9
Subanalysis of Antibody Status and Allergic

who had a positive antibody titer (P 5 .68) (see Fig. 1).

over 40 years. To the best of our knowledge, CCG-1961
has been 1 of the largest studies conducted using PEG
ASNase. We conducted a secondary analysis of allergic
reactions to 3 different ASNase preparations used in the
study and outcomes according to antibody status, allergic
reactions to PEG ASNase, and postconsolidation receipt
of PEG ASNase.
Incidence rates of hypersensitivity reactions to
ASNase during consolidation in this study were consistent
with reported rates ranging from 2% to 45%.10,12-16
Erwinia ASNase was associated with less allergic reactions
compared with both PEG ASNase and native ASNase
during interim maintenance phase 1 only. In all other
phases of therapy, there was no significant difference in
the incidence of allergic reactions. Possible explanations
for these findings could be that too few patients received
Erwinia ASNase or native ASNase for a meaningful comparison during consolidation; not many patients had allergic reactions to any form of ASNase during delayed
intensification phases 1 and 2, because dexamethasone
was administered concurrently; or, in interim maintenance phase 2, there few reactions, because the majority of
allergic reactions occurred early during the course of treatment. The decreased incidence of reactions to Erwinia
ASNase also may be related to its shorter half-life and different antigenic structures. We do know of reports indicating that antibodies to native ASNase measured by
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay do not cross-react to

Erwinia ASNase, so it is unlikely that the antibodies measured also react to Erwinia ASNase.17,18 It is likely that
there is no significant difference in hypersensitivity reactions between forms of ASNase when treated on this
protocol.
It is believed that allergic reactions to ASNase occur
as a result of antibodies, which cause significant toxicity
and neutralize the enzyme’s activity.19,20 Although there
are different methods for measuring the presence of antiASNase antibodies, the current standard is the enzymelinked immunosorbent assay method.15,21 In our study,
end-induction antibodies were associated with an
increased incidence of clinical allergy to PEG ASNase
during subsequent treatment phases, but they did not
affect 5-year EFS. In a subanalysis of patients who had
positive end-induction antibody titers and a subsequent
allergic reaction, there was no statistically significant
increase in the risk of an allergic reaction during consolidation versus later phases of therapy. We expected that
patients who had positive antibody titers would have a
higher incidence of allergic reactions during consolidation
than in later phases of therapy because the overall presence
of anti-ASNase antibodies would have a statistically significant association with the development of allergic reactions. However, this was not the case. It is possible that
the incidence of allergic reactions, when limited to the
consolidation phase, was not statistically significant
because of the prednisone taper, which continued into

consolidation, although the steroids were stopped over a
week before patients received additional ASNase. Furthermore, repeated exposure to PEG ASNase may have
increased the likelihood of an allergic reaction occurring
when patients had anti-ASNase antibodies. In addition,
the presence of anti-ASNase antibodies did not result
in inferior 5-year EFS, as has been suggested in the
literature.13,15
There have been various studies investigating the
clinical efficacy of different preparations of ASNase in the
treatment of childhood ALL. In a pair of studies that compared native ASNase with PEG ASNase (Dana Farber
Cancer Institute [DFCI] 91-01 and CCG-1962), there
was no difference in survival between the 2 groups, but
those studies were not powered to examine this question.14,15 In a trio of studies that compared native ASNase
with Erwinia ASNase (DFCI 95-01, European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer [EORTC]Children’s Leukemia Group study 58881, and the
National University Hospital Ma-Spore ALL study),
native ASNase improved survival compared with Erwinia
ASNase when given on the same schedule and at the same
dose.7,8,22 However, it is known that Erwinia ASNase has
a shorter half-life, and it is possible that the difference in
pharmacokinetics and the relative underdosing of Erwinia
ASNase caused inferior survival in the DFCI and EORTC
studies. Vrooman et al examined the outcomes of patients
on DFCI ALL Consortium study 00-01 who developed
allergies to native ASNase and were switched to Erwinia
ASNase. The dose of native ASNase in that study was
25,000 IU/m2 per dose given weekly, which was substituted with Erwinia ASNase 25,000 IU/m2 per dose given
twice weekly. Those authors observed neither an increase
in toxicity nor a difference in EFS.23 Willer et al performed a retrospective review of patients who initially
received native ASNase but developed high anti-ASNase
antibody levels (>200 AU/mL) and discovered that they
did not have an increase in ASNase activity as measured
by the indo-oxin method after switching to PEG ASNase,
although there was a significant increase in ASNase activity when patients were switched to Erwinia ASNase.24
Because of potentially decreased efficacy with Erwinia
ASNase based on the DFCI and EORTC study results,
we analyzed the survival data for patients who were
switched to Erwinia ASNase postconsolidation because of
an allergic reaction to PEG ASNase and observed no difference in 5-year EFS compared with patients who
received PEG ASNase throughout the study. Previously
published data on patients enrolled on CCG-1961 who
had neutralizing antibodies to native ASNase indicated
4210

that patients can be receive Erwinia ASNase and still
retain good activity of the enzyme.25 These data suggest
that 6 doses of intramuscular Erwinia ASNase at 10,000
IU/m2 per dose may be an adequate substitute for intramuscular PEG ASNase 2500 IU/m2 and can replace PEG
ASNase in patients who develop antibodies and/or clinical
allergies to native ASNase.
Because a small but significant number of patients
did not receive any ASNase postconsolidation on account
of serious adverse events (eg, anaphylaxis, thrombosis,
pancreatitis, etc), we compared the 5-year EFS of such
patients with the EFS of patients who received PEG
ASNase throughout the study, and we observed no difference. Although we are tempted to speculate that this may
indicate that ASNase is unnecessary after consolidation,
the numbers of patients were small, and this finding
should be investigated in the future. More recently,
reviews of patients who could not receive further ASNase
on frontline studies (UKALL 2003)26 and in relapsed
patients (ALLR3)27 revealed no difference in EFS or
overall survival when comparing those who could not
continue to receive ASNase versus those who did continue. Of course, these reflect different populations of
patients on different protocols; however, as more evidence
emerges, we believe that this should be investigated
further.
Here, we have demonstrated that: 1) Erwinia
ASNase is associated with less hypersensitivity compared
with PEG ASNase and native ASNase during interim
maintenance phase 1 only; 2) the presence of endinduction anti-ASNase antibodies is associated with an
increased risk of allergic reaction in subsequent phases; 3)
the presence of end-induction anti-ASNase antibodies
does not affect EFS; 4) patients with an allergy to PEG
ASNase do not have poorer EFS when it is substituted
with Erwinia ASNase; and 5) there may be no difference
in EFS between patients who did not receive any form of
ASNase postconsolidation and those who received PEG
ASNase throughout the study.
There are a few limitations to this study. First, these
analyses were done retrospectively and were not the endpoints that were defined for analysis. Second, current protocols no longer use native ASNase during induction,
which may alter the rates of antibodies formed against
ASNase during induction and allergic reactions to
ASNase in subsequent courses. Third, we were unable to
ascertain whether patients who had allergic reactions or
other adverse effects to ASNase that caused the discontinuation of ASNase received other therapies that may have
obviated the need for ASNase.

The current generation of Children’s Oncology
Group studies uses PEG ASNase. Although allergic reactions are likely to continue, the results from this study suggest that patients would be able to receive Erwinia ASNase
without affecting outcome. Although a substantial amount
of information regarding ASNase and its use in the treatment of childhood leukemia exists, there is still much to be
learned. We acknowledge that these analyses were not the
initial aims of the study, but they may help in asking specific questions about ASNase in future clinical trials.
