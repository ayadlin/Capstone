Abstract
NOV-002 is a novel glutathione disulfide mimetic that when
administered in combination with standard chemotherapeutic
regimens has resulted in increased efficacy (survival, tumor
response) and improved tolerance to chemotherapy (e.g.,
hematologic recovery) in advanced non–small cell lung cancer
patients. We show that NOV-002, which is not cytotoxic as
a single agent, generated time- and concentration-dependent
oxidative signals at the cell surface (reduction in protein
thiols) and intracellularly [altered oxidized glutathione
(GSSG) and reduced glutathione levels and ratio; increased
reactive oxygen species] in the premyeloid HL-60 cell line
and that this was associated with an increase in S-glutathionylation of cell proteins, particularly actin. Commensurate
with these effects, NOV-002 activated p38, c-Jun-NH2-kinase,
and extracellular signal-regulated kinase and caused a dosedependent increase in phosphorylation of three proteins
that have previously been linked with hematopoiesis, AKT,
JAK2, and STAT5. The effect of NOV-002 on enzymes involved
in glutathione metabolism was evaluated. Relative to oxidized
glutathione, NOV-002 was an equivalent substrate for glutathione reductase and was an inhibitor of protein disulfide
isomerase, one of the components of the redox-sensitive
unfolded protein response pathway. These redox-stimulated
cell signaling actions occurred in the context of increased
HL-60 cell proliferation after treatment with NOV-002. Overall,
the pleiotropic pharmacologic effects of NOV-002 can be
attributed to the GSSG component of the drug, and modulation of cellular redox balance is a feature central to the
mechanism of action of NOV-002. Such modulation may
underlie its clinical actions, including hematologic recovery
and immunostimulation in the face of chemosuppression.

Introduction
The structure of NOV-002 is shown in Fig. 1. It is oxidized
glutathione formulated with cisplatin at an approximately 1,000:1
ratio. Initial interest in the drug stemmed from clinical data
generated in the Russian Federation where it is approved and
marketed. In particular, in chemotherapy-naı̈ve advanced non–
small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients receiving NOV-002 +
standard chemotherapy displayed 63% 1-year survival compared

with 17% in the chemotherapy alone group (1). NOV-002 treatment
also increased tolerance to chemotherapy (patients were able to
receive more and more frequent cycles of chemotherapy), improved
hematologic and immune parameters and normalized kidney/liver
toxicity markers, and improved quality of life (Karnofsky performance score). Clinical activity of NOV-002 was confirmed in a U.S.
multicenter, open-label, randomized phase 1/2 trial in the same
patient population. In this trial, treatment with NOV-002 +
carboplatin/paclitaxel resulted in a significantly greater objective
tumor response (70%) compared with carboplatin/paclitaxel alone
(30%; ref. 1). Also, as in Russian studies, NOV-002–treated patients
were able to receive more cycles of chemotherapy. Safety results
confirmed Russian findings in that NOV-002 was well tolerated
and did not add to chemotherapy-related toxicities.
Given this unique clinical profile of increased efficacy and
improved tolerance when combined with standard chemotherapeutic drugs, it was of interest to further examine the pharmacologic activities of NOV-002. Nonclinical studies conducted in the
Russian Federation suggested that the drug might enhance
hematologic and immune recovery in the face of chemosuppression by increasing the production of regulatory cytokines and
growth factors.4 Other clinical results have implicated glutathione
in regulation of immune response. In particular, manipulation of
blood glutathione (GSH) levels has been shown to influence
survival and quality of life in HIV patients (2, 3). It would be of
some significance to elucidate a plausible general mechanism
linking glutathione with immunoregulation or hematopoiesis and
NOV-002 could provide a platform to achieve this.
There are precedents for pharmacologic manipulation of
glutathione pathways. For example, modulation of GSH levels
and glutathione S-transferase (GST) activity has been attempted as
a means to improve response to cancer drugs. Use of buthionine
sulfoximine and ethacrynic acid, although effective in their
experimental effects on each system, were not successful enough
in the clinic to merit continued development (4, 5). One
consequence of these approaches was the conceptual design of a
peptidomimetic inhibitor of GSTp, TLK199 [g-glutamyl-S-(benzyl)cysteinyl-R( )phenyl glycine diethyl ester]. Preclinical and mechanism of action studies with this agent revealed an unexpected
effect in animals, namely that the drug possessed myeloproliferative activity (6, 7). This agent, now named Telintra, is in phase 2
clinical trial; for review, see ref. (8). There are indications that
NOV-002 has a similar effect on myeloproliferation. However, to
date, no mechanism of action data have been published.
Sulfur has the essential chemical properties to exist in a
biologically reduced sulfhydryl state where the pK a of the thiol

group is f9.65, accounting for the nucleophilicity of reduced
glutathione. GSH homeostasis is maintained in cells by a complex
series of balanced pathways. De novo synthesis can occur through
the g-glutamyl cycle, where the three constituent amino acids
(glu-cys-gly) are combined with rate-limiting catalysis through
g-glutamylcysteine synthetase and glutathione synthetase. Salvage
of GSH can occur through the cleavage activity of the membraneassociated g-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) that can recycle
constituents of the molecule. Whereas intracellular concentrations
of GSH may vary considerably, 0.1 to 10 mmol/L are not
uncommonly found in mammalian cells (10–30 Amol/L in plasma).
Glutathione can occur in reduced (GSH), oxidized (GSSG), or in
mixed disulfide forms and its ubiquitous abundance is testament
to its biological importance. More recently, S-glutathionylation of
proteins has been recognized as an important posttranslational
modification. S-glutathionylation can influence conformation of
structural proteins such as actin (9) or enzyme function such as
protein kinase C-~ (10) or protein phosphatases (11). Significant
evidence has accumulated that protein S-glutathionylation regulates protein function, including elements of cell signaling pathways (12–14). Because GSSG can be involved as the proximal donor
in the S-glutathionylation reaction, the implications are that
NOV-002 may also provide donor substrate. We provide evidence

here that this is indeed the case and that, as a consequence of this
and other effects on cellular redox balance, NOV-002 influences
multiple cell processes and functions.

Materials and Methods
Chemicals. GSH, GSSG, 5,5¶-dithiobis-2-nitrobenzoic acid (DTNB),
2-vinylpyridine, NADPH, EDTA, and the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide reagent were purchased from Sigma.
Amplex Red was purchased from Molecular Probes. NOV-002 was provided
by Novelos Therapeutics, Inc. Antibodies were purchased from the following
sources: anti-glutathionylation (Virogen); anti–phospho-c-Jun NH2-terminal
kinase (JNK) and anti-p38 (Promega); phosphospecific extracellular
signal-regulated kinase (ERK; Santa Cruz Biotechnology); anti-JNK2
(BD Biosciences PharMingen); and anti-p38 and anti-ERK2 (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology).
Cell lines and cell culture. Mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEF) were
generated from wild-type and GSTk deficient mice as previously described
(6, 15). MEF and HL60 cells were maintained in DMEM containing 10%
FCS, 100 Ag/mL streptomycin, 100 units/mL penicillin, and 2 mmol/L
L-glutamine at 5% CO2 and 37jC.
Fluorometric detection of reactive oxygen species. HL60 cells were
treated with 300 Amol/L NOV-002 for 15 min. The Amplex Red fluorescent
dye [1 (Amol/L)/L] and horseradish peroxidase (5 units/2 mL) were added
and the release of H2O2 in the medium was detected at 37jC in a

absence of 300 Amol/L NOV-002. Flow cytometry was used to measure cell surface markers for differentiation: cd11 (C) and cd14b (D ). Columns, mean from triplicate
experiments; bars, SE.

fluorescence spectrophotometer. The excitation wavelength was 550 nm
and the fluorescence emission was measured at 585 nm. The signal was
generated from a calibration using known amounts of H2O2..
Flow cytometry. HL60 cells from control and treated groups were
stained with anti-CD11b or CD14 (PharMingen), Annexin, or Alexa fluor C5
Maleimide (Invitrogen). Fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis was
performed in the Flow Cytometry Facility at the Medical University of South
Carolina using a FACSCalibur (Becton Dickinson).
Measurement of GSH and GSH reductase. Total glutathione (GSH plus
GSSG) was determined by photometric determination of 5-thio-2-nitrobenzoate, which was produced from DTNB in a kinetic assay (16) in the
Drug Metabolism and Clinical Pharmacology Core Facility at the Hollings
Cancer Center. After experimental treatments, cells were harvested and
washed with ice-cold PBS. Cells were then suspended in 0.1 mol/L sodium
phosphate-5 mmol/L EDTA (pH 8.0) and sonicated to obtain the cell
homogenate. Two microliters of whole-cell lysate were removed for protein
quantification. An equal volume of 2 mol/L HClO and 4 mmol/L EDTA was
added to the cell extract, and the precipitated proteins were sedimented by
centrifugation at 8,000  g for 10 min at 4jC. The supernatant was
neutralized with 6 AL triethanolamine. For the spectrophotometric
determination, 10 AL of the cell extract supernatant or of the standard
glutathione solution, in the same phosphate-EDTA buffer, were mixed with
70 AL of 0.3 mmol/L NADPH in 0.5% (w/v) NaHCO3, 10 AL of 50 units/mL
glutathione reductase in phosphate-EDTA buffer, and 10 AL of 6 mmol/L
DTNB in 0.5% NaHCO3. The increase in absorbance was measured at
412 nm. For GSSG determination, 2-vinylpyridine was added to a final
concentration of 0.1% (v/v), and then incubated for 1 h at room
temperature. At this concentration, 2-vinylpyridine is able to react with
all GSH without interfering with the GSSG determination. The GSH/GSSG
content was expressed as nmol/mg protein. Values were represented as
the mean of three independent experiments F SD.
Quantitative real-time PCR. mRNA expression of BiP and CHOP, two
endoplasmic reticulum stress response genes, was quantitated by real-time
PCR using the TaqMan PCR core reagent kit according to the
manufacturer’s directions. RNA was extracted from control and treated
cells using the RNAeasy kit (Sigma). One microgram RNA was used to
prepare complementary DNA (cDNA) in a 50 AL reaction containing
1 Amol/L oligo-dT15 primer and Omniscript reverse transcriptase (Qiagen).
Real-time PCR was performed using 5 AL cDNA in a reaction mixture of
25 AL containing brilliant SYBR green master mix (Stratagene). All reactions
were performed in triplicate and data were analyzed using the 2 DDCT
method (17). Thermal cycler conditions were as follows: 50jC for 2 min,
95jC for 10 min, and 45 cycles of 95jC for 0.3 min and 60jC for 1 min.
Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was used as a gene control to
assess differences in transcript expression between groups.
GST activity assay. The effects of NOV-002 on enzyme activity were
evaluated with the 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB) substrate as
previously described (18). The specific activity of GST was assayed following
incubation of 0.5 Ag of recombinant GSTp at 37jC for 30 min in the
presence of 300 Amol/L NOV-002 or vehicle. The reaction mixture was
carried out in 100 mmol/L potassium phosphate buffer with 1.0 mmol/L
EDTA (pH 6.5), containing 1 mmol/L GSH and CDNB. The absorbance at
340 nm was monitored every 30 s for 2 min in a Bio-Rad Benchmark Plus
Microplate Spectrophotometer (Bio-Rad). The rate of spontaneous conjugation of GSH to CDNB was subtracted from the rates of GST-catalyzed
reactions. The extinction coefficient [5.3 (mmol/L) 1] for the CDNB
conjugate at 340 nm in 96-well plates was used to calculate the specific
activity. The specific activity was normalized to protein and expressed as
the mean [(Amol/L)/mL/min] F SD of three independent assays.
Protein disulfide isomerase activity assay. Recombinant human
protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) in the expression vector pET-28a was
provided (Dr. Lana Lee, Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry,
University of Windsor, Ontario, Canada) and expressed using the
Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3) as previously described (19). PDI was
incubated with various concentrations of NOV-002 in 0.1 mol/L sodium
phosphate, 2 mmol/L EDTA buffer for 30 min at 37jC. The activity of PDI
was monitored using a fluorescence-based assay (20) whereby reduction of

the substrate (FITC-peptide)ox was measured at 25jC in a photon-counting
fluorimeter following excitation at 494 nm. Maximal fluorescence was
measured by addition of DTT to fully reduce the peptide substrate.
Protein preparation. Cells (5  105 per treatment group) were
harvested and washed with 1 PBS. Cell pellets were suspended in lysis
buffer [20 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 15 mmol/L NaCl, 1 mmol/L EDTA,
1 mmol/L EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mmol/L sodium PPi, and 1 mmol/L
h-glycerophosphate with freshly added phosphatase inhibitors, 5 mmol/L
NaF and 1 mmol/L Na3VO4] and incubated for 30 min on ice. Lysates were
sonicated for 10 s and centrifuged for 30 min at 10,000  g at 4jC. Protein
concentrations in the supernatant were assayed with the Bradford reagent
(Bio-Rad Laboratories) using IgG as a standard.
Western blot analysis. Equal amounts of protein were separated on 10%
SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred overnight onto nitrocellulose
membranes (Bio-Rad). Nonspecific binding was reduced by incubating the
membrane in 10% blocking buffer for 1 h containing 20 mmol/L Tris-HCl
(pH 7.5), 150 mmol/L NaCl, 10% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Tween 20,
and 1 protease inhibitors. Protein expression was determined by
incubating membranes with specific primary antibody in 5% blocking
buffer according to the manufacturer’s recommendation. Briefly, the
membranes were washed thrice and incubated with the appropriate
secondary antibodies, conjugated with horseradish peroxidase, in 5%
blocking buffer for 1 h. The membranes were washed thrice and developed
with enhanced chemiluminescence detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences). The relative abundance of proteins was evaluated using Quantity
One software (ver.4.5.2; Bio-Rad) and plotted as arbitrary units in relation
to actin.
Statistical analysis. Mean values and SE were computed for each group.
These data were analyzed for statistically significant differences between
groups with Student’s t test. Differences were considered statistically
significant if the P value was <0.05.

Results
NOV-002 stimulates proliferation of the premyeloid cell line
HL-60. Patients treated with NOV-002 plus chemotherapy have
elevated levels of circulating leukocytes compared with those
treated with chemotherapy alone.5 To analyze whether NOV-002
affects growth or differentiation, we measured the growth rate and
doubling time of HL60 cells treated with a single dose of 300 Amol/L
NOV-002 (acute) or cells exposed to daily treatments of 300 Amol/L
NOV-002 for 5 days (chronic). NOV-002 treatment increased the
proliferative index and decreased the doubling time in HL60 cells
(Fig. 1). The average doubling time for untreated, control cells was
15.8 hours, whereas NOV-002 cells had a doubling time of 12.3
hours, a 22% decrease (P < 0.05). Using flow cytometry, cell surface
markers indicative of differentiation (CD14 and CD11b, which are,
respectively, decreased and increased in differentiated cells) were
assessed. NOV-002 treatment did not promote cell differentiation.
NOV-002 oxidizes cell surface protein thiols in vitro. Cell
surface protein thiols are believed to act as sensors of extracellular
redox status, and their modification has been linked to regulation
of cell signaling and other functions in a variety of cell types (21).
Intact GSSG is plasma membrane impermeable. However, HL60
cells express GGT and thereby have the potential to metabolize
NOV-002 into its constituent amino acids that can cross cell
membranes. To assess the effect of NOV-002 on cell surface protein
thiols, we preincubated HL60 cells with 300 Amol/L NOV-002 or
vehicle for 1 hour at 37jC (Fig. 2). To prevent internalization of the
probe, the cells were placed on ice and extracellular thiol content

Glutathione Disulfide Mimetic Effect on Redox Balance

Figure 2. Effects of NOV-002 on cell surface and intracellular protein S-glutathionylation in HL60 cells. A, HL60 cells were treated with 300 Amol/L NOV-002 or vehicle
for 1 h, placed on ice in the presence of fluorescently labeled NEM. Cell surface cysteine modifications were semiquantitated by flow cytometry. B, H2O2
production was measured in medium following treatment with 300 Amol/L NOV-002. Concentration-dependent (C ) and time-dependent (D ) effects of NOV-002 on
intracellular protein S-glutathionylation in HL60 cells were evaluated by dot-blot. Cells (1.5  106) were treated with varying concentrations of NOV-002, GSSG,
PABA/NO, or cisplatin (CDDP ). Following treatment for 1 h, 1 AL was dotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane and analyzed for S-glutathionylation by immunoblot.

was fluorescently labeled using Alexa-NEM. NEM has been shown
to bind to cell surface thiols present in large molecules, presumably
proteins, on human lymphocytes (22). Also, using maleimide-based
fluorescent dyes, GSSG has been reported to decrease cell surface
thiol content in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (23).
Figure 2A shows that exposure of HL60 cells to NOV-002 resulted
in a 15% decrease in total cell surface thiol content (P < 0.05). It
is important to keep in mind that protein thiol oxidation (i.e.,
S-glutathionylation) by NOV-002 would only occur at that fraction
of total protein thiols, which (a) are sterically accessible and (b)

display a relatively low pK a. Thus, the proportion of this subset
of cell surface protein thiols modified by NOV-002 may be
considerably higher than 15%.
NOV-002 generates multiple intracellular oxidative signals
in vitro. Maintenance of intracellular homeostatic redox balance
is a function of multiple intersecting pathways. Nevertheless, intracellular GSH/GSSG levels and ratios can provide a meaningful
measure of the oxidative status of the cell. Table 1 illustrates that
by 1 hour after treatment of HL60 cells with 300 Amol/L of
NOV-002 intracellular levels of both GSH and GSSG were elevated

and returned to control levels by 24 hours (P < 0.05). Although
absolute levels of GSH and GSSG increased transiently following
treatment, the ratio of GSH/GSSG was decreased by f36% after
NOV-002 treatment, indicating the generation of a mild oxidative
signal within the cell.
We explored whether NOV-002 treatment leads to the formation
of reactive oxygen species (Fig. 2B). Fluorescent Amplex red was
used to measure the H2O2 production in the medium of cells
treated with NOV-002, H2O2, or PABA/NO. NOV-002–treated HL60
cells have an f2.5-fold increase in H2O2 production compared
with untreated cells (P < 0.05). PABA/NO, a nitrosative stressinducing agent, caused no statistically significant difference in
Amplex red signal. These data suggest that NOV-002 induces mild
oxidative stress that does not lead to cell death.
S-glutathionylation of intracellular proteins. Protein Sglutathionylation is increasingly recognized as an important
mechanism underlying redox regulation of signaling pathways
and other cell functions (review refs. 12, 24). Figure 2 shows dose
response (C) and time course (D) results for total protein
S-glutathionylation in HL-60 cells exposed to NOV-002 and/or
PABA/NO (a positive control, nitrosating agent that has been
shown previously to cause high levels of S-glutathionylation;
ref. 14). NOV-002 treatment resulted in a dose-dependent increase
in total intracellular protein S-glutathionylation. Quantitatively
similar results were obtained after treatment with GSSG; however,
cisplatin (present in trace amount in NOV-002) did not cause
S-glutathionylation, even at a highly cytotoxic dose (100 Amol/L).
Although in some instances the S-glutathionylation antibody can
interfere with the specific protein antibody, our overall experience
is that NOV-002 treatment does not alter actin expression levels
( for an example, see Fig. 3A).
Gel electrophoretic separation of the total protein pool following
treatment of HL60 cells with NOV-002 revealed that the major
S-glutathionylated protein was actin (Fig. 3A). Although NOV-002
treatment did not alter the expression levels of actin, S-glutathio-

nylation modification of the protein increased in a dose- and timedependent manner. S-glutathionylation of actin alters the ratio of
F ( filamentous) and G (globular) actin, leading to marked changes
in the overall cytoskeletal architecture and concomitant changes
in cellular trafficking (25). Using confocal microscopy, we evaluated
the cytoskeletal architecture and stress fibers with phalloidin
staining (which binds specifically to actin; Fig. 3B). NOV-002
treatment resulted in a reduction of focal adhesions compared with
untreated controls indicative of significant cytoskeletal alterations,
which could have important functional implications as well.
Phosphorylation of kinase pathway proteins. Cell signaling
pathways regulated by the mitogen activated protein kinases
(MAPK) are one example of linkage between redox-mediated
signaling and phosphorylative cascades (26). Given the alterations
in redox balance at the cell surface and intracellularly resulting
from exposure to NOV-002, the effect of treatment of HL60 cells
with NOV-002 on kinase expression and phosphorylation patterns
were examined. As shown in Fig. 4, under conditions where
NOV-002 resulted in protein S-glutathionylation, phosphorylation
of several MAPK pathway kinases (JNK, ERK, and p38) were all
also increased in a dose-dependent and a time-dependent (data
not shown) manner. At the same time, the actual protein levels
of each of the three kinases were not influenced by NOV-002
treatment. In addition, Fig. 5 shows that NOV-002 treatment in a
dose-dependent manner caused an increase in the phosphorylation
of AKT, JAK2, and STAT5, three proteins the modification of which
has been associated with signal transduction (27) and myeloproliferation (7).
NOV-002 effects on glutathione pathway-related enzymes.
The proposed active component of NOV-002 is oxidized glutathione. We evaluated the effects of NOV-002 treatment on glutathione
pathway–related enzymes. Inhibition of GSTp activity, independent
of changes in intracellular redox status, has been shown to lead to
increased proliferation in myeloid cells (7). In a cell-free system,
NOV-002 did not alter GSTp activity [49 F 2 (Amol/L)/mL/min

S-glutathionylation by immunoblot (A). Actin
modification was observed by placing control and
treated cells on polylysine-coated coverslips
and staining for phalloidin (B ).

Glutathione Disulfide Mimetic Effect on Redox Balance

Figure 4. Effects of NOV-002 on the MAPK
pathway. Concentration-dependent effects of
NOV-002 on stress kinases and their
phosphorylated products are consistent with
actin glutathionylation patterns. HL60 cells were
treated for 1 h with 0 to 500 Amol/L NOV-002 in
complete medium. Fifty micrograms of protein
lysate were separated by SDS-PAGE and
analyzed by immunoblot for phosphorylated
and total levels of (A) JNK, (B ) p38, and (C)
ERK. The corresponding relative abundance of
phosphorylated proteins was plotted as the
relative ratio to actin.

versus control 53 F 2 (Amol/L)/mL/min], suggesting that the
proliferative effect of NOV-002 on HL60 cells was independent of
GSTp activity. Oxidized glutathione is the endogenous substrate for
glutathione reductase and NOV-002 was shown to be equivalent
substrate to GSSG for glutathione reductase (Fig. 6), a factor that
may be relevant to the observation that NOV-002 treatment leads
to a transient increase in intracellular GSH as well as GSSG levels.
PDI is an endoplasmic reticulum resident chaperone and also
found at the surface of cells, including myeloid cells. PDI cycles
between an oxidized and reduced state and is influenced by redox
balance. Incubation with NOV-002 led to extensive inhibition of
PDI activity in a cell-free system (Fig. 6B).

Discussion
NOV-002 is a novel therapeutic agent in late-stage development
for oncology indications (1). It is composed of GSSG formulated
with cisplatin at a f1,000:1 molar ratio. The active pharmaceutical
ingredient is GSSG, with the cisplatin appearing to increase
exposure to GSSG after systemic administration without contributing to the therapeutic action of NOV-002.6 A typical therapeutic
dose of NOV-002, 60 mg, administered daily over 6 months would
result in a cumulative total dose of cisplatin equivalent to <2% of a
typical single dose of cisplatin when used to treat cancer patients.
NOV-002 is not cytotoxic alone even at high doses, and whereas
NOV-002 causes protein S-glutathionylation, the platinum compo-

nent does not. Instead, findings reported here collectively suggest
that the capacity for modulation of redox conditions at the cell
surface and/or intracellularly may underlie the pharmacologic
properties of NOV-002. Clinical studies have shown that NOV-002
stimulates myeloproliferation, with increases in circulating lymphocyte, monocyte, T-cell, and natural killer cell counts.7 In this
context, other clinical reports have implicated GSH in regulation of
immune response. Manipulation of blood GSH levels has been
shown to influence survival and quality of life in HIV-infected
patients (2, 3) and administration of N-acetyl cysteine (a precursor
of GSH) has been advanced as a therapy to enhance immune
response (28). Additional approaches to manipulate glutathione
pathways and thiol balance have also been shown to effect
proliferation of myeloid progenitor cells, and it now seems
reasonable to suggest a linkage between the two (8). In this regard,
elucidating mechanism(s) of action of NOV-002 could contribute
to a general understanding of how glutathione pathways are linked
with hematologic and immunoregulation and, ultimately, with
aspects of the clinical profile of NOV-002.
Our data suggest that the NOV-002 has pleiotropic effects on
model cell systems, each of which is consistent with altered redox
conditions at the cell surface or intracellularly, and with the
conclusion that NOV-002 exerts pharmacologic effects through its
GSSG component. It is generally accepted that GSSG will not
passively cross the cell membrane (29). Thus, the effects of
NOV-002 on cells may be mediated via direct effects on cell surface

Figure 5. Effects of NOV-002 on the
JAK-STAT kinase pathway. Concentrationdependent effects of NOV-002 on stress
kinases and their phosphorylated products
are consistent with actin glutathionylation
patterns. HL60 cells were treated for
1 h with 0 to 500 Amol/L NOV-002 in
complete medium. Fifty micrograms protein
lysate were separated by SDS-PAGE
and analyzed by immunoblot for
phosphorylated and total levels of (A)
AKT, (B) STAT-5, and (C) JAK-2. The
corresponding relative abundance of
phosphorylated proteins was plotted as the
relative ratio to actin.

targets. Alternatively, the interaction of NOV-002 with a membraneassociated enzyme such as GGT ( for which GSSG is a substrate)
could result in hydrolysis into constituent amino acids, whereupon
extra availability of cysteine could stimulate GSH metabolism.
In addition, there has been a report that GGT, through Fenton
chemistry activity, can result in the liberation of H2O2, which is
cell permanent and capable of transmitting an oxidative signal
into the cell (30). The increased bioavailability of GSSG through
NOV-002 administration could increase the flux of H2O2 as a
consequence of stimulating the GGT activity.
With respect to activity at the cell surface, NOV-002 treatment of
HL-60 cells reduced cell surface thiol content, suggesting oxidative
modification of cell surface proteins. A growing body of evidence
suggests that redox-based modulation of surface proteins is
capable of regulating cellular function (31). One potential target
of such modification is cell surface PDI, which has been shown to
regulate, for example, viral entry into cells (e.g., HIV-1 due to redox
modulation of CD4 on lymphocytes and the HIV-1 envelope
glycoprotein gp120; ref. 32), cell-mediated adhesion by integrins
(33), and tumor cell invasiveness (34). Because NOV-002 was also
found to inhibit PDI activity, this enzyme may represent a cell
surface target for this drug candidate, a possibility further
supported by the finding that GSSG can act as a proximal donor
in the S-glutathionylation of PDI,8 thus regulating its function.
Intracellularly, NOV-002 treatment of HL-60 cells resulted in
multiple changes indicative of alterations in redox balance against
the backdrop of stimulating the rate of cell proliferation with no

effect on markers of cell differentiation. Redox conditions can
regulate a number of signaling pathways and directly control cell
division and differentiation responses. In neuronal progenitor cells,
a fine tuning of the redox balance has led some investigators to

Glutathione Disulfide Mimetic Effect on Redox Balance

suggest that as little as a 15% increase/decrease in cellular redox
can turn on pathways that channel cells toward either proliferation
and cell division, or differentiation (35, 36). In the results described
here, NOV-002 altered intracellular levels of GSH and GSSG by
>35% as well as caused a time- and concentration-dependent
increase in the phosphorylation of three kinases that play direct
roles in cell proliferation (JNK, p38, and ERK) and in AKT, a kinase
that acts in concert with JAK2 and STAT5 to regulate marrow
proliferation. The JAK-STAT signaling pathway is intimately
involved in governing the response of cells to cytokines and
growth factors (27). Activation of the pathway by NOV-002
indicates that the drug is effecting those pathways that lead to
hematopoiesis/myeloproliferation. These results are consistent
with earlier work with TLK199, another small-molecule myeloproliferative agent (7). In each case, these stimulations were
temporally coincident with the induction of S-glutathionylation
of actin and could suggest a cause-effect relationship between
signaling and cytoskeleton morphology. S-glutathionylation occurs
to certain target proteins when a cell is exposed to oxidative or
nitrosative stress (37). Filomeni and colleagues have used a number
of model systems to show that under certain conditions, GSSG
can act as a pro-oxidant activator of the p38 MAPK death pathway
(26, 38). Indeed, their studies generally reflect the important role
that GSSG has in mediating early response pathways through redox

changes that transduce to a kinase signaling cascade that affects
cell survival pathways. As such, the concomitant increases in
intracellular GSSG, actin S-glutathionylation, kinase phosphorylation, and cell proliferation in HL-60 cells treated with NOV-002 may
be causally interrelated.
In summary, NOV-002 was found to exert pleiotropic effects in
HL-60 cells that are consistent with the conclusion that its active
pharmaceutical ingredient is GSSG and that its central mode of
action may involve modulation of redox balance at the cell surface
and intracellularly. Although identification of the specific molecular targets of NOV-002 requires further study, redox modulation
regulates downstream kinase events that may be responsible for its
stimulation of proliferation in this premyeloid cell line, an effect
that could be related to the clinical profile of NOV-002 in oncology
patients, which includes myeloproliferation and improved tolerance of cytotoxic chemotherapy.
