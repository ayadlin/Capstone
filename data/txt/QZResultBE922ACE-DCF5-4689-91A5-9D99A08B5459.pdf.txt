BACKGROUND. Trastuzumab for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer is highly efficacious yet
costly and time-intensive, and few data are available about its use. The authors of this report examined receipt and completion of adjuvant trastuzumab by race/ethnicity and education for women with HER2-positive disease. METHODS. The National Comprehensive
Cancer Network Breast Cancer Outcomes Database was used to identify 1109 women who were diagnosed with stage I through III,
HER2-positive breast cancer during September 2005 through December 2008 and were followed for 1 year. The authors used multivariable logistic regression to assess the association of race/ethnicity and education with the receipt of trastuzumab and, among
those women who initiated trastuzumab, with the completion of > 270 days of therapy. RESULTS. The cohort was 75% white, 8%
black, and 9% Hispanic; and 20% of women had attained a high school degree or less. Most women (83%) received trastuzumab, and
no significant differences were observed according to race/ethnicity or socioeconomic status. Among the women who initiated trastuzumab, 73% of black women versus 87% of white women (P ¼ .007) and 70% of women with less than a high school education versus 90% of women with a college degree completed > 270 days of therapy (P ¼ .006). In adjusted analyses, black women (vs white
women) and women without a high school degree (vs those with a college degree) had lower odds of completing therapy
(black women: odds ratio, 0.45; 95% confidence interval, 0.27-074; white women: odds ratio, 0.27, 95% confidence interval, 0.14-0.51).
CONCLUSIONS. Differences in completing trastuzumab therapy were observed according to race and educational attainment among
women who received treatment at National Comprehensive Cancer Network centers. Efforts to assure the appropriate use of
trastuzumab and to understand treatment barriers are needed and may lead to improved outcomes. The authors report differences
in the rate at which patients complete treatment with trastuzumab according to race and education among women who receive
treatment at National Comprehensive Cancer Network centers. Efforts to assure the appropriate use of trastuzumab and to underC 2012 American Cancer Society.

INTRODUCTION
Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) is an important mediator of cell proliferation and differentiation.1,2
Although women with HER2-positive breast cancers traditionally have had poor prognoses,3 the natural history of this
disease subtype changed dramatically with the development and widespread use of trastuzumab. Since June 2005, adjuvant treatment guidelines have recommended that standard chemotherapy be supplemented with trastuzumab for patients
with HER2-positive cancers4 after large-scale randomized trials demonstrated an approximately 0.50 risk of disease recurrence compared with chemotherapy alone, with few adverse events.5-7 Trastuzumab administration involves a 30-minute
to 90-minute infusion administered weekly or every 3 weeks for 1 year with an estimated total cost of > $100,000 when
trastuzumab is incorporated into anthracycline-based chemotherapy regimens.8
Previous research has demonstrated disparities in the receipt of adjuvant therapies, including radiation and endocrine therapy, for black woman compared with white women.9-12 In addition, black women experience worse breast cancer outcomes than white women, even when matched for known prognostic factors.13 Although the reasons for racial
disparities in outcomes are multifactorial, differences in receipt of efficacious treatments likely contribute. Differences in
the receipt of breast cancer care and outcomes by socioeconomic status (SES) also have been observed,14-18 although

studying associations of treatment and outcomes with
SES is often reliant on area-level measures of education
and income.
Although trastuzumab has substantially improved
outcomes for women with HER2-positive breast cancer, a
risk for disparity has arisen because of the high cost and
time-intensive commitment required for therapy. The
identification of potential treatment differences among
women with HER2-positive breast cancer is crucial, yet
few data are available about the receipt of trastuzumab.
We examined disparities in the receipt and completion of
adjuvant trastuzumab in a large cohort of women who
were treated in National Comprehensive Cancer Network
(NCCN) centers across the United States.

to 1145 women who were diagnosed with breast cancer
between September 2005 and December 2008 who had
follow-up data through December 2009. After excluding
36 women who had < 365 days of follow-up at the
reporting institution, the first cohort included 1109
women.
For the second cohort, we focused on the 925
women from Cohort 1 who initiated any trastuzumab.
We excluded 17 patients who had a break in their trastuzumab regimen > 30 days (because of uncertainty in
interpreting the reasons for treatment break), 2 women
who had 0 days of trastuzumab documented, and 18
women who stopped trastuzumab for progression, transfer of care, or death. Cohort 2 included 888 women.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Data Source

Since 1997, the NCCN Breast Cancer Outcomes Database Project has evaluated patterns and outcomes of cancer care.19 It prospectively captures information on
patient and tumor characteristics, treatments, and outcomes abstracted from patients, medical records, and
institutional systems for women with breast cancer who
receive treatment at member institutions.20-22 Patients are
included in the database if they receive all or some of their
treatment at a reporting center; those with 1-time consultations are not included. Eight centers contributed data to
the current analysis: City of Hope National Medical Center, The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer
Center, Fox Chase Cancer Center, Dana-Farber Cancer
Institute, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, H. Lee Moffitt
Cancer Center, the University of Michigan Cancer Center, and Ohio State University. NCCN data include information abstracted from medical records on age, HER2
status, other tumor characteristics, comorbidity, and
treatments received as well as patient-reported information on race/ethnicity, educational attainment, insurance,
and employment. Data collected by the NCCN are subject to rigorous quality assurance and routine on-site
audits of source documents against submitted data.
Study Cohorts

We identified 2 study cohorts. We examined receipt (ie,
initiation) of trastuzumab in Cohort 1 and completion of
trastuzumab therapy in Cohort 2. Cohort 1 included
adult women with a first diagnosis of stage I, II, or III
breast cancer that overexpressed HER2, defined as a ‘‘positive’’ result by fluorescence in situ hybridization or a score
of 3 þ , ‘‘high positive,’’ or ‘‘positive not otherwise specified’’ by immunohistochemistry. We restricted this cohort

Variables of Interest

Our dependent variables of interest were 1) receipt of adjuvant/neoadjuvant trastuzumab for the first cohort and 2)
completion of adjuvant trastuzumab for the second
cohort. Receipt of trastuzumab was defined as having a
reported start date for trastuzumab at any time after diagnosis but before any recurrence. Completion of trastuzumab was defined as documented receipt of > 270 days of
treatment, which was calculated by summing the duration
of all trastuzumab treatments received in the neoadjuvant
and/or adjuvant setting (considering all women who
received  75% of the recommended 1 year of trastuzumab therapy as having completed therapy). For the 62
women who did not have an end date documented for
trastuzumab, we used the date of last follow-up with medical oncology at the NCCN institution as a proxy for the
end date. By using this definition, 59 of 62 women were
categorized as having completed trastuzumab, and 3 of 62
women were defined as not having completed
trastuzumab.
Our independent variables of interest were race/ethnicity and education. Race/ethnicity was categorized as
non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, Hispanic, and
Asian/Pacific Islander/other. We defined education as college/postgraduate degree, some college/junior college,
high school graduate, less than high school graduate, and
unknown. Additional independent variables at diagnosis
(categorized as indicated in Table 1) included age,
employment, insurance, comorbidity (based on Charlson
and Katz scoring systems23,24 from medical records and
patient surveys), institution (blinded, labeled A through
H), diagnosis year, disease stage, tumor grade, and hormone receptor status.

Statistical Analysis

We compared rates of trastuzumab receipt and completion by race/ethnicity, education, and other patient characteristics using individual chi-square tests. We used 2
logistic regression models to assess the probability of 1)
receipt of trastuzumab and 2) completion of trastuzumab
by race/ethnicity and education, adjusting for the indeCancer

pendent variables listed above. We used generalized estimating equations to account for clustering at the
institutional level.
We performed multiple sensitivity analyses for
Cohort 2. First, we repeated the analyses restricted to
patients with stage II and III disease, because most of the
adjuvant clinical trials with trastuzumab included higher

risk patients, and some patients with stage I disease may
have been treated differently. Second, we repeated the
analyses after redefining the completion of trastuzumab as
receipt of  350 days of treatment among patients who
had  18 months of follow-up. Third, because 59 of 62
women without documented treatment end dates were
defined as having completed trastuzumab, we repeated
the analyses assuming that all 62 of these women did not
complete therapy. Finally, because the development of
cardiotoxicity can have an impact on treatment, we
repeated the models with inclusion of a binary variable for
anthracycline receipt.
All reported P values were 2-sided, and statistical
analyses were conducted using SAS version 9.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Because analyses used previously collected data without identifying patient information, the
study was considered exempt from review by the Institutional Review Board at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute.
RESULTS
Patient and tumor characteristics for Cohort 1 are presented in Table 1. Most women were white (75%), 8%
were black, 9% were Hispanic, and 7% were Asian/Pacific
Islander/other race/ethnicity. Approximately 36% of
women completed college/graduate school, whereas 20%
of women attained a high school degree or less. There
were no significant differences in age, comorbidity, diagnosis year, stage, or tumor grade by race/ethnicity,
842

although white women had the highest percentage of hormone receptor-negative cancers. Overall, white women
and those of Asian/Pacific Islander/other race had higher
educational attainment than black and Hispanic women.
White women were most likely to be insured by managed
care; whereas black, Hispanic, and Asian/other women
had higher rates of Medicaid/indigent/self-pay coverage.
Among the 1109 women in Cohort 1, 83% initiated
trastuzumab. Unadjusted rates of trastuzumab receipt did
not differ by race/ethnicity (range, 82%-90%; P ¼ .151)
(Fig. 1, top) or education (range, 81%-85%; P ¼ .91)
(Fig. 1, bottom). In adjusted analyses, we did not observe
racial/ethnic or education differences in treatment initiation (Table 2). With regard to other variables, women
aged  70 years (vs < 50 years), those with the highest (vs
the lowest) comorbidity, and those with lower/intermediate (vs higher) tumor grade had lower odds of treatment
receipt; whereas women who were diagnosed during 2006
to 2008 (vs 2005) and those who had stage II and III disease (vs stage I disease) had higher odds of treatment
receipt. Compared with the reference institution, all but 1
institution had lower odds of trastuzumab initiation (Table 2).
Among the 888 women in Cohort 2, 86% completed  270 days of treatment with a median treatment
duration of 350 days (range, 2-1261 days). The rates of
treatment completion were lowest for black women compared with other women (Fig. 1, top) and for women with
less than a high school education (Fig. 1, bottom). In
adjusted analyses (Table 2), black women had significantly lower odds of completing trastuzumab compared
with white women (odds ratio [OR], 0.45; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.27-0.74). In addition, we observed
differences in therapy completion by education; women
who had no high school diploma and those who had a
high school diploma but no college education had lower
odds of completion compared with those who had a college degree (OR, 0.27 [95% CI, 0.14-0.51] and 0.50
[95% CI, 0.33-0.77], respectively). We observed no differences in the odds of completing trastuzumab therapy
among women in Cohort 2 by age, comorbidity, diagnosis year, stage, or tumor grade; however, we did observe
institutional variation: Five centers had higher odds, 1
center had lower odds, and 1 center had similar odds of
completing therapy compared with the reference institution (Table 2).
In a sensitivity analysis for the second cohort, after it
was restricted to patients with stage II or III disease (n ¼
612), the results for race/ethnicity and education were
similar to the initial model (black women vs white

women: OR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.23-090; less than high
school education vs college degree: OR, 0.27; 95% CI,
0.14-0.51). In an analysis restricted to patients who had 18
months of follow-up (n ¼ 731) with trastuzumab completion defined as treatment for > 350 days, black women had
persistently lower odds of completion compared with white
women (OR, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.31-0.72), although the findings for education were no longer statistically significant
(OR for less than high school education, 1.12 [95% CI,
0.62-2.02]; OR for high school diploma, 0.86 [95% CI,
0.64-1.16] both vs college degree). In the model that categorized 62 women without a completion date as having not
completed trastuzumab, the results also were similar to the
original analysis (data not shown). Finally, in the model
with the anthracycline variable, the findings for race and
education were unchanged (data not shown). Employment
was not significant in any of the models performed.
DISCUSSION
We examined the receipt of trastuzumab, an efficacious yet
costly and time-intensive treatment, by race/ethnicity and
education in a large cohort of women with HER2-positive
breast cancer who received treatment at NCCN centers
across the United States. We observed no disparities in initiation of trastuzumab by race/ethnicity and education but
found differences in treatment completion, with black
women and those with lower educational attainment having
significantly lower odds of therapy completion compared
with white and college-educated women. Our findings were
robust to multiple sensitivity analyses. To our knowledge,
this analysis represents the first examination of differences in
the receipt of trastuzumab.
Given the substantial improvement in outcomes
from receipt of trastuzumab for HER2-positive breast
cancers, the overall high rates of receipt and completion of
therapy observed in the current study were reassuring,
suggesting substantial agreement with treatment recommendations among practicing oncologists.4 Moreover,
despite the burden of ongoing infusional treatments, 86%
of women who initiated trastuzumab completed  270
days of therapy. This is higher than estimates of completing standard infusional chemotherapy among patients
who initiated adjuvant chemotherapy for colon cancer, in
which studies have demonstrated variable 6-month completion rates of 58% to 78%, with lower rates of completion among older patients and those with greater
comorbidity.25-27 Nevertheless, despite the relatively high
rates of trastuzumab completion in our analysis, the disparities we observed raise concerns. Although it is possible
that patients still may benefit from shorter durations of
844

trastuzumab,28 this has not been well studied, and guidelines recommend 1 year of therapy for all patients.4
Possible explanations for the differences in rates of
treatment completion include toxicity, variable patient
preferences, institutional variations in toxicity assessments, and provider and patient adherence, which may be
amplified by the need for frequent infusions over a prolonged period. Previous studies have suggested that black
women may have an increased risk of cardiotoxicity with
anthracycline chemotherapy,29-32 although detailed toxicity assessments for minority patients receiving trastuzumab
have not been reported. Lower adherence also has been
reported for nonwhite women and women of lower SES
who initiate adjuvant hormone therapy,33-35 in which 5
years of adjuvant therapy is recommended.4 Barriers to
long-term adherence, including patient/family preferences
to discontinue therapy early, may be particularly relevant
for women of lower SES, who may have more difficulty
freeing themselves from work and childcare commitments.
Although we observed lower odds of treatment completion
for those who did not graduate high school, we did not
observe differences in completion of treatment by employment. However, this may have resulted from our inability
to distinguish types of jobs among employed women. We
also did not observe differences in receipt or completion of
treatment by insurance, suggesting broad insurance coverage for trastuzumab. It is noteworthy that our cohort
reflected a group that sought care at a NCCN center and
included very few patients without insurance.
Although specific barriers to completion of care
could not be elucidated in our study, our results suggest
that the development of interventions may be necessary to
assure completion of therapy for women who do not experience serious toxicity. Because of the need to continuously calculate the number of trastuzumab infusions a
patient has received, enhanced electronic medical records
with provider reminders for a patient’s expected end date
of therapy may help to assure that all doses are delivered.
Strategies also may focus on patient adherence, with
patient reminders and/or provider alerts if a patient misses
an infusion appointment. Enhanced patient education
about the benefits of trastuzumab and the expected duration of therapy may be particularly useful for those with
lower educational attainment.
We observed lower rates of treatment receipt for
women with lower risk cancers, for older women, and for
women with greater comorbidity. These findings were
not surprising given the uncertainty about the optimal
systemic treatment strategy for lower risk disease and concerns about toxicity, competing risks, or perceived lower

benefits of treatment in older and sicker populations.
Although trastuzumab is well tolerated in most women, it
is initially administered with chemotherapy. Consequently,
decisions to treat older and sicker women are likely based
on concerns about tolerance of chemotherapy rather than
trastuzumab. Other studies have demonstrated lower rates
of adjuvant chemotherapy for older women with breast
cancer,36,37 but few data are available regarding the rates of
trastuzumab receipt for women of various ages.38,39 Among
women who initiated trastuzumab in our study, we
observed no differences in the odds of completing therapy
by age or comorbidity; thus, providers may be selecting
patients to receive treatment who will optimally tolerate it.
The strengths of this analysis include our ability to
examine detailed information on the receipt of infusional
treatments for a large cohort of women with information on
HER2 status and individualized information on employment and education: variables that are not currently available
in other cancer registries. However, we acknowledge several
limitations. First, the care patterns in NCCN centers may
not be generalizable to other settings, and the numbers of
minority women were relatively small. Nevertheless, assessment of care at academic centers is of interest. Second,
although NCCN data on trastuzumab duration may be
imperfect, our findings were robust to sensitivity analyses
and rigorous data-quality checks. Third, detailed information on why trastuzumab was stopped was not available, nor
did analyses account for other factors that may have influenced treatment, such as social supports, marital status, or
distance to the medical center. Finally, because of the small
numbers of women in some subgroups (ie, employment, insurance), we may have had insufficient power to detect small
differences in the outcomes of interest.
In conclusion, we observed differences in completion,
but not initial receipt, of adjuvant trastuzumab by race and
education. Further work is needed to better understand differences in adherence, reasons for premature cessation, and
differences in tolerance to therapy. With the expected substantial improvement in outcomes for women who receive
1 year of adjuvant trastuzumab, improved and appropriate
administration of this agent may have a significant impact
on disease recurrence and survival for women with HER2positive breast cancer. Interventions aimed at assuring the
receipt of guideline care for all women with HER2-positive
breast cancers should be a priority.
