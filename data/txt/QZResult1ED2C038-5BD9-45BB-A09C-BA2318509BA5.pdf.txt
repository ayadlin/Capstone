A Woman’s Heart
The Impact of Adjuvant Endocrine Therapy on Cardiovascular Health
Michael S. Ewer, MD, MPH, JD1 and Stefan Glück, MD, PhD2

Adjuvant therapy in postmenopausal women with breast cancer may contribute to the expression of underlying cardiovascular disease or expose the heart to additional toxicities. Tamoxifen remains an important
component of endocrine therapy for breast cancer, although major clinical trials of the aromatase inhibitors
(AIs) anastrozole, letrozole, and exemestane suggest that these agents are more effective and better tolerated alternatives to tamoxifen. The AIs inhibit the conversion of androgens to estrogen in postmenopausal
women; consequently, their mechanism of action differs from that of tamoxifen. Accordingly, although it
has been observed that tamoxifen has some favorable effects on cardiovascular risk, such as reducing total
cholesterol levels, because of its partial estrogen-agonist properties, no such effects exist for the AIs.
Some studies, particularly those that compare the AIs with tamoxifen, have suggested a less favorable
impact of adjuvant AI therapy on cardiovascular risk. Comorbid conditions, including cardiovascular disease, emerge as competing causes of death as women with breast cancer continue to live longer, and the
potential impact of adjuvant therapies on cardiovascular risk becomes an increasingly important consideraC 2009 American Cancer Society.

Patients with breast cancer are at risk for death not only from cancer or its complications but also
from the other major competing causes of mortality in postmenopausal women, particularly cardiovascular disease. Cardiovascular disease is a major health concern in most industrialized countries,
with a prevalence in the United States of 42.7 million in 2005 and mortality of 459,000 in 2004.1
Although a lower incidence of cardiovascular disease is observed among women than among men in
the group ages 20 to 39 years, this gap narrows with advancing age and eventually exceeds that of men
after age 60 years (Fig. 1)1; thus, cardiovascular disease constitutes a significant health threat among
older, postmenopausal women independent of breast cancer.1,2 Endocrine interventions remain the
cornerstone of adjuvant therapy for patients who have breast cancer with estrogen-sensitive, estrogen
receptor (ER)-positive disease; and, as women with breast cancer live longer in the face of more effective therapies, they will be more likely to die from causes unrelated to breast cancer or its treatment, such

as cardiovascular disease or bone fractures.3 Thus, there
is a risk for both cardiovascular disease4 and the cardiovascular side effects of breast cancer treatments.5 Therefore, cardiovascular disease will continue to compete as
a cause of death in these patients6; it has been estimated
that the number of women with breast cancer who are
living with such risk is 2.3 million in the United States
alone.4
The selective ER modulator tamoxifen reduces both
disease recurrence and breast cancer-related mortality in
women with ER-positive, early disease.7 Results from the
Oxford meta-analysis of tamoxifen trials demonstrated
that the benefits of adjuvant hormone therapy for breast

cancer in postmenopausal women are both substantive
and persistent and increase over time. Among women
who were randomized to receive approximately 5 years of
tamoxifen treatment, the risk of breast cancer recurrence
after 15 years of follow-up was reduced by 41% (absolute
reduction, 11.8%), and the risk of death was reduced by
34% (absolute reduction, 9.2%).7 It has been observed
that tamoxifen has lipid-lowering effects; and, in metaanalyses, a potential cardioprotective effect of the drug
was observed in which the rate of death from events such
as myocardial infarction (MI) was reduced with active
treatment (Table 1).7-10 Despite these benefits, however,
tamoxifen also has been associated with an increased risk
of events such as stroke, pulmonary embolism, and deep
vein thrombosis (Table 1).7-12
Results from the Cancer Research Network have
indicated that, since 2000, the third-generation aromatase inhibitor (AI) drugs anastrozole (1 mg per day orally
for 5 years), letrozole (2.5 mg per day orally for 5 years),
and exemestane (25 mg per day orally until the completion of 5 years adjuvant endocrine therapy) have been
replacing tamoxifen as adjuvant endocrine therapy for
postmenopausal women with early breast cancer.13
Results from the Oxford meta-analysis, as noted above,
demonstrated the enormous benefits of adjuvant hormone therapy in terms of reducing breast cancer recurrence and mortality, and the AIs have improved upon
tamoxifen treatment still further; the AIs generally have
proven to be between 15% and 25% more effective than
tamoxifen in terms of reducing the relative risk of recurrence,14-16 in some cases reducing potentially lethal

distant metastatic recurrences by up to 27% over tamoxifen.14 Major clinical trials, thus, have indicated a significant benefit of adjuvant AI treatment over tamoxifen in
terms of disease-free survival (DFS), distant DFS, and
contralateral breast cancer, but, up to this point, not in
terms of overall survival.14-16 In view of the efficacy of
AIs relative to tamoxifen, increased survival of women
with breast cancer could allow the impact of competing
causes of death to become more evident; indeed, small
but significant increases in some (although not all) cardiovascular outcomes have been observed relative to tamoxifen in large clinical trials comparing the 2
treatments.14,15,17 This phenomenon may be related to
the absence of tamoxifen-associated cardioprotective
effects in women on AI therapy rather than an adverse
effect of AIs per se; differences also exist in cardiovascular
event definitions and the rigor with which such data are
collected across the various AI trials.
With continued improvement in DFS after breast
cancer diagnosis, the impact of competing causes of
death and the influence of adjuvant endocrine treatments on this risk will become increasingly important.
For this review, we examined the issue of heart disease
in aging postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer and the putative impact of adjuvant AI therapy on cardiovascular risk in this
population as gleaned from the results of major adjuvant AI clinical trials.

Cardiovascular Disease Risk
After Menopause
Results from the Framingham Heart Study (N ¼ 2036)
demonstrate that women have lower systolic and diastolic
blood pressures as well as lower pulse pressures and mean
arterial pressures than men during the fourth decade of
life; however, these differences narrow by age 70 years
and, in some cases (eg, in the case of systolic blood pressure and pulse pressure), reverse thereafter.18 The change
in blood pressure and associated cardiovascular disease
risk may be related at least in part to menopause. Obesity
also has been associated with increased risk of both new
hypertension and cardiovascular disease in the Framingham Study; for overweight and obese women, the ageadjusted relative risk ratios for cardiovascular disease,
Cancer

including angina pectoris, coronary heart disease, MI, and
cerebrovascular disease, were 1.20 and 1.64, respectively.19 Weight increase is very prevalent; approximately
67% of the population in the United States is classified as
overweight, and studies indicate that weight gain also
occurs in patients with breast cancer who are receiving adjuvant endocrine therapy.20-22
Thus, postmenopausal women with breast cancer
are at an already increased risk for cardiovascular disease,18,23 and adjuvant endocrine therapy can increase this
risk. Moreover, the populations that are studied in clinical
trials are not representative of the general population. Often, major clinical studies exclude patients with pre-existing hypertension or cardiovascular disease for safety
reasons; thus, the population studied may be at a comparatively reduced cardiovascular risk. The presence or absence of comorbid conditions in postmenopausal women
with breast cancer also may have an impact on their cardiovascular risk. The impact of the third-generation AIs on
cardiac health will be an important consideration as their
use increases.
Effect of Adjuvant Aromatase Inhibitor
Therapy on Serum Lipids
The influence of serum lipids, including total cholesterol,
low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and serum triglycerides, on atherogenesis and the cardiovascular risk profile
is well established. In this regard, it is noteworthy that
both tamoxifen and the AIs have demonstrated effects on
serum lipids. This may explain at least in part some of the
differences in cardiovascular risk that have been observed
in clinical trials.
Tamoxifen

Studies have demonstrated that tamoxifen has a generally favorable impact on serum lipids. In a placebo-controlled study of postmenopausal women with breast
cancer (N ¼ 140), patients had a 12% decrease in total
cholesterol and a 20% decrease in LDL-C at 2 years (P <
.001).24 It is noteworthy that, in that study, HDL-C levels
(‘‘good’’ cholesterol) also decreased during treatment with
tamoxifen; however, the decrease was only significant at 1
of 5 assessments. A longer term study of a group of
patients in the Scottish adjuvant tamoxifen trial (N ¼ 44)
1815

Review Article

also indicated that tamoxifen consistently and significantly lowered cholesterol levels and that this effect ended
with treatment cessation, whereas no such effect was
observed in the control group (no tamoxifen).25 No significant effect on HDL-C was reported in that study,
although the small number of patients may have precluded such a result. In a comparative study with another
antiestrogen, torimefine, both drugs reduced total cholesterol and LDL-C levels.26 However, whereas torimefine increased HDL-C by 14%, tamoxifen decreased
HDL-C levels by 5% (P ¼ .001). Taken together, these
findings provide evidence that tamoxifen decreases
both total cholesterol and LDL-C, although its impact
on HDL-C appears to be less favorable vis-a-vis cardiovascular health.
Aromatase inhibitors

An open-label, randomized study compared the
impact of 24 weeks of treatment with anastrozole, letrozole, or exemestane on lipid parameters in healthy postmenopausal women (N ¼ 90).27 At 12 weeks, only
exemestane was associated with a significant decrease in
total cholesterol from baseline (5.5%; 95% confidence
interval, 9.7 to 1.3), but there were no significant differences between anastrozole versus exemestane, anastrozole versus letrozole, or letrozole versus exemestane
(overall P ¼ .535). At 12 weeks and 24 weeks, there was a
significant increase in the LDL-C:HDL-C ratio versus
baseline in the exemestane group that differed significantly from both the anastrozole group and the letrozole
group; this resulted from a decrease in HDL as opposed to
an increase in LDL.27 Although triglyceride levels had an
early, significant increase in the letrozole group compared
with the exemestane and anastrozole groups at 12 weeks,
this increase did not persist to the 24-week assessment.
Data comparing the effects of AIs in breast cancer patients
receiving adjuvant therapy are limited and mostly are
derived from comparisons with tamoxifen, which, in view
of its own effects on serum lipids, can confound
assessments.
Aromatase inhibitors versus tamoxifen

The major clinical trials that are examining the
safety of AIs include the Arimidex Tamoxifen Alone or in
Combination (ATAC) study, the Breast International
Group (BIG) 1-98 trial, and the Intergroup Exemestane
1816

Study (IES). At a median follow-up of 68 months, the
ATAC study (N ¼ 6186) reported a higher incidence of
hypercholesterolemia with anastrozole (278 of 3092
patients) than with tamoxifen (108 of 3094 patients) that
was statistically significant (9% vs 3%; odds ratio [OR],
2.73; P < .0001).17 It is worth noting that lipid profiles
were obtained at the investigator’s discretion in that study
and were not assessed systematically in the trial, and profiles were not reported at the 100-month follow-up.28
Patients in the anastrozole group also experienced significantly more hypertension (402 events [13%] vs 349
events [11%]; hazard ratio [HR], 1.18; P ¼ .04). Unfortunately, the information gleaned from the cardiovascular
data in the ATAC trial remains a bit unclear because of
the trial methodology (passive collection of these adverse
events).
In contrast to other adjuvant AI trials, the BIG 1-98
trial was designed to review the potential effect of AIs on
lipid metabolism comprehensively and systematically.
The definition of a hypercholesterolemia event in BIG 198 included any measurement above the upper limit of
normal (ULN) that occurred at 1 or more of the 6-month
visits during the study. In addition, nearly all (90%) of
these cholesterol measurements were taken under nonfasting conditions and at various times of day.29
In the BIG 1-98 primary core analysis at a median
follow-up of 25.8 months (N ¼ 8010), serum cholesterol
was stable with letrozole at 6 months, 12 months, and 24
months; whereas it decreased in the tamoxifen group by
12%, 13.5%, and 14.1%, respectively.14 More patients in
the letrozole group experienced hypercholesterolemia,
which was defined as normal cholesterol at baseline and
increasing to 1.5 times greater than the ULN at least once
during treatment (173 of 3203 patients [5.4%] vs 40 of
3224 patients [1.2%]).30 Most of the events in both treatment arms (>80%), however, were grade 1 (defined as
>ULN 300 mg/dL or >ULN 7.75 mmol/L according to Common Toxicity Criteria guidelines) and
required no intervention.14,29,30 When the results were
assessed over 60 months, there was a 12% reduction in
total cholesterol in the tamoxifen group during the first
6 months, whereas levels in the letrozole group remained
stable; thereafter, total cholesterol levels remained constant in both groups.29 These results are consistent with a
benefit of tamoxifen in the first 6 months in terms of lowering total cholesterol as opposed to a detrimental effect

of letrozole on lipids. Results from a subset analysis that
was restricted to the monotherapy arms of BIG 1-98
(n ¼ 2448 in the letrozole arm; n ¼ 2447 in the tamoxifen
arm) demonstrated significantly more low-grade cholesterol elevation with letrozole relative to tamoxifen at 51
months (50.6% vs 24.6%; P < .001).31 Once again, the
majority of these events were grade 1 (letrozole: 985 of
1238 events; 80%), and most cholesterol values were
assessed under nonfasting conditions (90.8%).31
A cardiovascular safety analysis (N ¼ 7963) that was
performed at a median follow-up of 30.1 months revealed
a decrease in median total cholesterol levels for patients in
both the letrozole group and the tamoxifen group. The
decrease for patients who were receiving tamoxifen was
immediate, whereas the decrease for patients who were
receiving letrozole began at approximately 30 months after randomization.32 An increase in total cholesterol levels
versus baseline occurred in more patients who were receiving letrozole than patients who were receiving tamoxifen;
this explains the greater proportion of low-grade hypercholesterolemia with letrozole that was reported in the primary core analysis.32
The effect of the steroidal AI exemestane on serum
lipids relative to tamoxifen has been examined in the Tamoxifen Exemestane Adjuvant Multicenter (TEAM) trial
and the IES. In the TEAM lipid substudy (N ¼ 176;
n ¼ 90 in the exemestane arm; n ¼ 86 in the tamoxifen
arm), there was a trend toward reduced triglycerides with
exemestane, whereas triglycerides increased with tamoxifen. In addition, although total cholesterol tended to
decrease from baseline in both groups, there was a signifiCancer

cant decrease with tamoxifen at 12 months relative to
exemestane (P ¼ .012).33 In this study, LDL levels
decreased over time with tamoxifen but fluctuated with
exemestane. There was no overall change in HDL with either regimen, and the total cholesterol:HDL ratio
remained stable for both regimens.
The Japanese TEAM substudy demonstrated that
tamoxifen was associated with a decrease in mean total
cholesterol levels and with significantly lower total cholesterol levels compared with anastrozole or exemestane.
Patients who received tamoxifen also had lower LDL levels at all time points (P  .0001) and reduced lipoprotein
parameters compared with patients who received anastrozole or exemestane.34 Compared with anastrozole,
exemestane was associated with significantly lower mean
levels of cholesterol at 3 months and at 12 months (P 
.01 for both).34 Mean triglyceride concentrations were
significantly lower with exemestane compared with tamoxifen at all time points (P  .0001) and compared
with anastrozole at 3 months (P  .01) and at 6 months
(P  .0001).34 In the IES (N ¼ 4658), which assessed the
impact of a switch to exemestane after 2 to 3 years of adjuvant tamoxifen, after 55.7 months of follow-up, hypercholesterolemia trended higher in the exemestane arm
versus the tamoxifen arm (204 of 2320 patients [8.8%] vs
178 of 2338 patients [7.6%]; P ¼ .14), but the difference
did not reach statistical significance (Table 2).16
Aromatase inhibitors versus placebo

Given the effect of tamoxifen on serum lipids, comparisons of AIs with placebo may be more informative. In
1817

Review Article

a 2-year study of postmenopausal women with breast cancer who were randomized to an exemestane arm (n ¼ 58)
or a placebo arm (n ¼ 65), there was no significant
effect of exemestane on lipid parameters, except for a
6% to 9% decrease in HDL-C and a 5% to 6% decrease
in apolipoprotein A1.35,36 It is noteworthy that the ontreatment changes in lipids with exemestane were
reversed within the 3 to 12 months of follow-up (ie, after exemestane discontinuation),35,36 suggesting that
there is no carryover effect of exemestane and that
exemestane is unlikely to have a detrimental effect on
lipids over time.
Because lipid and cardiovascular data were not
reported in the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast And
Bowel Project (NSABP) B-33 trial, letrozole is also the
only AI that has placebo-controlled cardiovascular data
from a large adjuvant trial.37,38 The MA.17 trial, which
examined the impact of extended adjuvant letrozole after
about 5 years of tamoxifen, provides for the largest comparisons of AIs with placebo. At a median follow-up of 30
months, an identical incidence of hypercholesterolemia
was observed (418 of 2572 patients [16%] for letrozole vs
411 of 2577 patients [16%] for placebo; P ¼ .79), and
these findings contrast with those from the BIG 1-98 trial,
in which tamoxifen was the comparator.38 There was no
difference in rate of hypertension between the letrozole
and placebo groups (5% for both; P ¼ .94). In the MA.17
lipid substudy (MA.17L; n ¼ 347), despite marginally
significant changes in some parameters, there were no
significant differences between the treatment groups in
the percentage of patients that exceeded the defined
thresholds for total cholesterol, HDL-C, or LDL-C at
any time point.39 The effects of letrozole and placebo
on total cholesterol, LDL-C, and HDL-C over time are
shown in Figure 2; at 24 months and 36 months, there
was no significant difference in the mean percentage
change from baseline between groups for these parameters in patients who had samples drawn under fasting
conditions.39 Similarly, in MAP.1, a prevention trial of
postmenopausal women with increased mammographic breast density treated with letrozole or placebo
for 12 months, letrozole was associated with a transient
decrease in total cholesterol at 3 months but with no
other significant changes in lipid parameters, including
HDL-C, LDL-C, and triglycerides at 12 months or 24
months.40

Cardiovascular Disease
Aromatase inhibitors versus tamoxifen

Unfortunately, the information gleaned from the
cardiovascular data in the ATAC trial was limited to
patient self-reports, because the trial was not designed to
analyze cardiac risk systematically. Results from the
ATAC trial (at 68 months) indicated a trend toward a
higher incidence of ischemic cardiovascular events that
did not reach statistical significance (most commonly
mild-to-moderate angina) between women who received
anastrozole relative to women who received tamoxifen
(n ¼ 127 [4.1%] vs n ¼ 104 [3.4%]; P ¼ .1); the incidence of other ischemic cardiovascular events (coronary

artery disease, MI, or ischemia) was not different between
the groups (2% for both; P ¼ .5).17 However, recent data
indicate that grade 3 and 4 cardiovascular events (ie, angina pectoris and MI) were reported more frequently in
patients who received anastrozole than patients who
received tamoxifen (117 patients in the anastrozole arm vs
96 patients in the tamoxifen arm).41 Furthermore, the
number of deaths caused by cardiovascular events in the
ATAC trial is difficult to interpret, because there was 1
report of a greater incidence with anastrozole versus tamoxifen (2% vs 1%; 49 deaths with anastrozole vs 46
deaths with tamoxifen),17 but another report indicated
that the rate of deaths from ischemic cardiovascular events
was 0.8% in each group. After 100 months of follow-up,
the incidence of MIs was collected, and there was no significant difference; a similar incidence was observed both
on treatments (anastrozole vs tamoxifen: 37 events vs 33
events; annual rate, 0.27 vs 0.27, respectively) and after
the completion of treatment (26 events vs 28 events; annual rate, 0.28 vs 0.30, respectively).28 It is noteworthy
that the similarity in the off-treatment incidence of MI
suggests a lack of carryover effect for anastrozole. The cardiovascular data reported in the ATAC trial remain
unclear; there may have been an under-reporting of these
events because of the trial’s methodology concerning
safety evaluations.
In the IES, at 55.7 months of follow-up, the incidence of cardiovascular events (excluding vascular thrombotic events) did not differ between the groups during
treatment (382 of 2320 patients [16.5%] on exemestane
vs 350 of 2338 patients [15%] on tamoxifen; P ¼ .16) or
when post-treatment events were included.16 Independent cardiologists reviewed serious cardiovascular events
and also defined higher level cardiovascular groupings to
facilitate comparison with other studies.16 The frequency
of ischemic cardiovascular disease (8% vs 6.9% for the
exemestane arm vs the tamoxifen arm, respectively;
P ¼ .17) and the frequency of MI (1.3% vs 0.8%, respectively; P ¼ .08) during treatment also trended toward
significance between treatment groups; however, among
patients who experienced an MI, 71.1% in the exemestane group had hypertension at baseline versus only
31.6% of the corresponding patients in the tamoxifen
group. This argues strongly in favor of regular blood
pressure monitoring for patients who are receiving adjuvant exemestane.16

Unlike other adjuvant AI trials, the BIG 1-98 trial
was designed to methodically review the potential effect of
AIs on cardiac risk, and an in-depth analysis of cardiovascular adverse events from the primary core analysis was
undertaken by Mouridsen et al14,32 The results at a median of 30.1 months of follow-up demonstrated that the
overall incidence of any cardiovascular event was similar
in the letrozole arm and the tamoxifen arm (191 of 3975
patients [4.8%] vs 188 of 3988 patients [4.7%], respectively; P ¼ .87).32 The risk for any grade 3 through 5 cardiac event was higher with letrozole versus tamoxifen
(HR, 1.63; P ¼ .004); these events were rare in the overall
trial population, and the risk of grade 3 through 5 ischemic
heart disease was similar for both treatments (HR, 1.46;
P ¼ .12).42 In an unplanned analysis of the grade 3 through
5 events, the incidence of grade 3 through 5 cardiac events
was significantly higher with letrozole (96 of 3975 patients
[2.4%] vs 57 of 3988 patients [1.4%]; P ¼ .001), whereas
the events were relatively rare in both arms.32 The incidence
of ischemic heart disease was higher with letrozole than with
tamoxifen, but the difference did not reach significance (45
of 3975 patients [1.1%] vs 29 of 3988 patients [0.7%];
P ¼ .06).32 In addition, the incidence of cardiac failure was
significantly higher with letrozole (26 of 3975 patients
[0.7%] vs 13 of 3988 patients [0.3%]; P ¼ .04).32
Further results from a subset analysis that was restricted to the monotherapy arm of BIG 1-98 (n ¼ 2448
patients on letrozole monotherapy; n ¼ 2447 patients on
tamoxifen monotherapy) at 51 months of follow-up
revealed that, although letrozole was associated with more
cardiac events in each grade compared with tamoxifen
(Fig. 3), there was no significant difference in cardiac
events overall (5.5% vs 5%, respectively; P ¼ .48), ischemic heart disease (2.2% vs 1.7%, respectively; P ¼ .21), or
cardiac failure (1% vs 0.6%, respectively; P ¼ .14)
between groups.31 There was an increase in the incidence
of grade 3 through 5 cardiac events with letrozole (P <
.001; Fisher exact test), but the number of events was
small in each arm.31 Notwithstanding the low numbers
and the similar overall relative rates of cardiac events, particularly when tamoxifen was used as the comparator, it
cannot be ignored that there were more than twice as
many grade 3 events with letrozole (74 events vs 35
events) in this population (N ¼ 4895). Despite the relatively low overall incidence, and even in the face of the
observed oncologic benefit, this disparity is of potential

concern and should be acknowledged; additional followup and study are needed. Cardiovascular events classified
as ‘‘other,’’ although they occurred at low frequency, were
more numerous with letrozole (19 of 2448 patients
[0.8%] vs 62 of 2447 patients [0.2%]; P ¼ .014).31
Because this analysis had longer follow-up (51 months), it
is important to also consider the impact of patient age on
cardiovascular health, because it has been demonstrated
that the prevalence of comorbidities among patients with
newly diagnosed breast cancer increases with age, and cardiovascular disease is the most common comorbid condition.23 It also has been demonstrated that survival
decreases with the presence of comorbid conditions, illustrating the importance of comorbid conditions like preexisting cardiovascular disease as competing causes of
death in older breast cancer patients.
In a meta-analysis of randomized trials of adjuvant AI
therapy versus tamoxifen in early breast cancer, all AIs were
associated with a significantly higher risk of grade 3 and 4
cardiovascular adverse events. The absolute differences, however, were small (<1%), and 160 to 180 patients were
needed to observe 1 event.20 These results do not suggest detrimental effects of the AIs but, rather, provide further support for the cardioprotective effects of tamoxifen.
Aromatase inhibitors versus placebo

Comparisons with placebo may be the best way to
truly understand the impact of adjuvant AI therapy on
cardiac health. When comparing letrozole with placebo in
1820

the MA.17 trial (median follow-up, 2.5 years; N ¼ 5187),
similar incidences of cardiovascular disease were observed
(letrozole vs placebo: 149 of 2572 patients [5.8%] vs 144
of 2577 patients [5.6%]; P ¼ .76).38 MIs were rare and
occurred in 0.3% (9 of 2572) and 0.4% (11 of 2577) of
patients in the respective groups. A recent study examining causes of patient death in MA.17 indicated that nonbreast cancer deaths accounted for 60% of the known
deaths in the study, with higher rates observed in the
group aged 70 years (72% nonbreast cancer deaths) and
lower rates in the group aged <70 years (48% nonbreast
cancer deaths). Women with pre-existing cardiovascular
disease also were significantly more likely to die from
causes other than breast cancer (P ¼ .02).3 Thus, as
women survive for longer periods free from breast cancer,
they are more likely to die from causes other than breast
cancer.

Thromboembolic and Cerebrovascular
Events
Aromatase inhibitors versus tamoxifen

At the 68-month follow-up in the ATAC trial, there
was a significantly reduced incidence of both vascular
thrombotic events overall (87 of 3092 patients [2.8%] vs
140 of 3094 patients [4.5%]; P ¼ .0004) and deep vein
thrombosis events (48 of 3092 patients [1.6%] vs 74 of
3094 patients [2.4%]; P ¼ .02) with anastrozole
(n ¼ 3092) versus tamoxifen (n ¼ 3094), respectively.15
In the ATAC trial, thromboembolic events were recorded
only during active treatment 14 days thereafter; thus,
occurrences of thromboembolic events at 100 months
were similar to those at 68 months.28 A detailed analysis
examining the long-term effects of anastrozole versus tamoxifen on the risk of vascular thrombotic events occurring in the ATAC trial at 68 months (n ¼ 51 pulmonary
embolism, n ¼ 147 deep vein thrombosis, n ¼ 178 superficial thrombophlebitis) indicated a 39% decrease in vascular thrombotic events for patients on anastrozole
relative to tamoxifen (OR, 0.61; P < .0001), and the rates
of vascular thrombotic events were similar in the tamoxifen/combination groups (OR, 1.10, P ¼ .38).43 Results
also demonstrated that the risk of a vascular thrombotic
event was greatest during the first 2 years but persisted
throughout the 5-year period for patients on tamoxifen.
Thus, the risk for vascular thrombotic events appears very

early, in the first 2 years, in tamoxifen-treated patients.43
A significantly lower incidence of cerebrovascular events
with anastrozole versus tamoxifen (2% vs 2.8%; P ¼ .03)
was reported.17 After 100 months of follow-up, the incidence of cerebrovascular accidents continued to be lower
with anastrozole during treatment (20 events, annual rate
0.16 [0.64%] vs 34 events, annual rate 0.28 [1.1%]; OR,
0.59; P ¼ .056) but not off treatment (22 events, annual rate
0.24 vs 20 events, annual rate 0.21; OR, 1.10; P ¼ .75),
which suggests a lack of tamoxifen carryover effect on cerebrovascular events.28 Deaths resulting from cerebrovascular
events were not different between the anastrozole and tamoxifen groups (0.8% vs 0.9%, respectively).
In BIG 1-98, there was a significantly lower incidence of thromboembolic events and a similar incidence
of cerebrovascular accidents/transient ischemic attacks
(39 of 3975 patients [1%] vs 41 of 3988 patients [1%];
P ¼ .91) with letrozole relative to tamoxifen at the 25.8month follow-up (61 of 3975 patients [1.5%] vs 140 of
3988 patients [3.5%]; P < .001).14 In the safety analysis
of the primary core analysis at a median follow-up of 30.1
months, there was a significantly lower incidence of
thromboembolic events in the letrozole group versus tamoxifen (68 of 3975 patients [1.7%] vs 154 of 3988
patients [3.9%]; P < .001), and the incidence of cerebrovascular accidents/transient ischemic attacks was 1.2% in
both the letrozole arm (47 of 3975 patients) and the tamoxifen arm (49 of 3988 patients; P ¼ .92).32 Similarly,
in the subset analysis of the monotherapy arms at 51
months, the reduction in thromboembolic events with
letrozole remained significant (50 of 2448 patients [2%]
vs 94 of 2447 patients [3.8%]; P < .001).31 Identical incidences of cerebrovascular accidents/transient ischemic
attacks were observed (1.4% and 1.4%; P ¼ .90).14,31
The benefit of AI therapy over tamoxifen in terms of
reducing vascular thrombotic events also was evident in
women with previous exposure to tamoxifen (2-3 years of
prior therapy). In the IES at a median follow-up of 55.7
months, vascular thrombotic events occurred in 1.2% (28
of 2320) of patients who switched to exemestane, compared with 2.3% (54 of 2338) of patients who continued
on tamoxifen (P ¼ .004).16 Similar results were observed
when considering events that occurred both during treatment and after treatment (1.9% vs 3.1%, respectively;
P ¼ .01). The incidence of cerebrovascular accidents during treatment was 1.4% and was identical to that observed
Cancer

May 1, 2009

in patients who continued on tamoxifen (P ¼ .98), and
similar results were reported when events both during
treatment and after treatment were considered (2.5% vs
2.4%, respectively; P ¼ .89).16
Aromatase inhibitors versus placebo

Limited data are available comparing thromboembolic events and cerebrovascular events between AIs and
placebo. Among postmenopausal women with previous
exposures to tamoxifen (4.5-6 years) in the MA.17 trial,
vascular thrombotic events occurred at low frequency (11
of 2572 patients [0.4%] on letrozole vs 6 of 2577 patients
[0.2%] on placebo), and the incidence of cardiovascular
disease was not statistically significant (P ¼ .76) between
letrozole and placebo.38 The incidence of cerebrovascular
events (stroke and/or transient ischemic attacks) was low,
with 17 events in 2572 patients on letrozole (0.7%) compared with 15 events in 2577 patients on placebo
(0.6%).38 Further data on vascular thrombotic events
with AIs versus placebo are likely to be gained from the
NSABP B-42 trial, which is investigating the optimal duration of adjuvant letrozole versus placebo. The B-42 trial will
compare 5 years of treatment with letrozole or placebo in
postmenopausal women who have completed 5 years of previous endocrine therapy; it includes the incidence of arterial
thromboembolic events as a secondary endpoint.44

Summary of Aromatase Inhibitor Effects
on Cardiovascular Health
All AIs, steroidal and nonsteroidal alike, have similar lipid
and cardiovascular profiles compared with tamoxifen; in
addition, letrozole has been studied versus placebo, and
no significant differences have been observed. The
increased lipid levels reported with AIs versus tamoxifen
may reflect the lipid-lowering effect of tamoxifen.38 There
is no clear evidence of a long-term detrimental effect of AI
therapy on lipids, despite the finding that significantly
more patients experienced hypercholesterolemia in the AI
group compared with patients who were exposed to tamoxifen in the ATAC and BIG 1-98 trials14,15; indeed,
hypercholesterolemia and cardiovascular events were
observed at similar frequencies when letrozole was compared with placebo in the MA.17 trial (Table 2).38 Results
from the MA.17 lipid substudy also indicated no

Review Article

significant adverse effect of letrozole on lipid parameters
compared with placebo (Fig. 2).39
Similarly, with respect to overall cardiovascular safety,
the weight of evidence from clinical trials suggests no major
differences among the AIs.6,45 Although it has been suggested that a steroidal AI may have beneficial effects on
lipid metabolism,46 the effect of steroidal (exemestane) and
nonsteroidal (letrozole and anastrozole) AIs on lipid parameters appears to be similar27; and, in the absence of
comparative studies, it should not be assumed that the AIs
differ in this regard. It is more likely that these slight
increases are largely because of the lipid-lowering effects of
tamoxifen rather than differing effects of the AIs on lipids
based on their selectivity for the aromatase enzyme or their
class (nonsteroidal vs steroidal).14,16,17 Although AIs may
lack the lipid-lowering and cardioprotective effect of tamoxifen, the risk of cardiovascular events such as fatal MI
and other forms of cardiovascular disease is well within the
range observed in an age-matched, nonbreast cancer population in Finland.47 This also was observed when comparing
MI rates for letrozole and tamoxifen in the BIG 1-98 trial
with MI rates in the United Kingdom General Practice
Research Database and the Swedish MI register.6 The
increasing use of AIs as alternatives to tamoxifen also
appears to provide benefit in lowering the incidence of
potentially serious events, such as deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and stroke, all of which are increased
among patients who are treated with tamoxifen.14-16
Directly comparative trials under way include the
Femara Anastrozole Clinical Evaluation (FACE) trial
(anastrozole vs letrozole) and the MA.27 trial (anastrozole
vs exemestane); these should provide more reliable data
with respect to any potential differences among the AIs on
cardiovascular risk factors and disease.48,49 In the FACE
trial, which recently completed enrollment, the incidence
of cardiovascular events and changes in serum lipids are
being evaluated as secondary safety endpoints.48

Management of Cardiovascular Risks in
Breast Cancer Patients
Regardless of adjuvant therapy choices for postmenopausal women with breast cancer, several recommendations can be made to improve the cardiovascular risk
profile. The use of statins, beta-blockers, and/or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and sulfonylureas or
1822

metformin to manage hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and
diabetes, respectively, is appropriate.4 An emphasis on
lifestyle modification (eg, smoking cessation, exercise
training, dietary management) also may be helpful. Body
weight and physical activity level are modifiable risk factors for cardiovascular disease and may be overlooked
when considering the long-term impact of adjuvant therapy.4 Results from the Women’s Healthy Eating and Living Study Group have indicated that >70% of women
with breast cancer had weight gains of 2.5 to 6.2 kg during
adjuvant therapy (mean change, þ2.7 kg [6 pounds]).50 It
is noteworthy that factors that were associated positively
with weight gain in that study included adjuvant therapy
and postmenopausal status, whereas negative factors
included an exercise index score. Another study demonstrated that early breast cancer patients decreased their
physical activity significantly in the year after diagnosis by
approximately 2 hours per week, an 11% decrease (P <
.05).51 In addition to increasing risks for cardiovascular
disease, decreases in activity level and the associated
increases in weight among women with newly diagnosed
breast cancer also may have unfavorable consequences for
the disease process. In 1 study, 51 postmenopausal
women who were overweight or obese had significantly
higher serum sex hormone levels, including estradiol, bioavailable estradiol, estrone, and estrone sulfate; whereas an
inverse relation was observed for sex hormone-binding
globulin (all P < .05).52 Current body mass index (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters
squared) at ages 50 years and 35 years and waist-hip ratios
were associated with increased breast cancer risk, particularly in women who were not using menopausal hormone
therapy.53 A comprehensive review of published observational studies further suggests that women with breast
cancer who are overweight or who gained weight after the
diagnosis of malignancy are at greater risk for recurrence
and death, and this may relate in part to unfavorable hormone profiles resulting from adiposity.54 Thus, interventions like weight reduction, increasing physical activity,
and pharmacologic management of dyslipidemia, hypertension, and/or hyperglycemia can provide meaningful
reductions in the risk of cardiovascular disease and can
improve overall health for patients who are on adjuvant
therapy for breast cancer. The general population of
women receiving adjuvant endocrine therapy is more
likely to have pre-existing coronary heart disease risk
Cancer

factors than women who are enrolled in clinical studies.
Such women should be monitored and treated according
to the appropriate guidelines.55,56 On the basis of the
National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III guidelines, the diagnostic criteria for
hypercholesterolemia are LDL-C 160 mg/dL, HDL-C
<40 mg/dL, and total cholesterol 240 mg/dL.55,56
In conclusion, the cardiovascular risk factors present
in breast cancer patients reflect those in the general population. Regular assessment and management of cardiovascular risk is an important component of therapy for
women with breast cancer. Periodic assessment of serum
lipids and management of hypertension and weight are
essential to minimize cardiovascular risk, especially in
women aged >65 years, who constitute >50% of the
breast cancer population.56 Studies with tamoxifen have
suggested a beneficial effect of the drug on serum lipids,
particularly total cholesterol and LDL (but not triglycerides) for women who receive adjuvant therapy for breast
cancer. These benefits may contribute to the apparent cardioprotective effect of tamoxifen and the reductions in
some cardiovascular disease endpoints. The potential benefits of tamoxifen therapy on cardiovascular health, however, must be balanced with the risk for recurrence of
breast cancer. Major studies, including ATAC, BIG 1-98,
and the IES, have demonstrated a significant DFS advantage for AIs over tamoxifen.14-16 The results of these studies clearly demonstrate the benefits of adjuvant hormone
treatment with the AIs relative to tamoxifen in terms of
reducing the risk of recurrence, especially with regard to
reductions in eventually lethal distant metastatic events.14
Regardless of the potential for cardiovascular events, the
substantive benefits of AI therapy with respect to breast
cancer far outweigh the risks, and this should be taken
into account when considering treatment options for
patients. With this improved efficacy in reducing breast
cancer recurrences and longer survival after breast cancer
diagnosis, cardiovascular disease and other comorbidities
undoubtedly will continue to emerge as competing causes
of death in women who receive adjuvant AI therapy.
Although not specifically designed or powered to assess
cardiovascular endpoints, AI clinical trials have provided
some evidence for an increase in selected cardiovascular
events, particularly when tamoxifen was the comparator.
This raises potential concerns that suggest the need for
additional follow-up and study. The evidence suggests,
Cancer

May 1, 2009

however, that these findings are due to the lack of tamoxifen’s putative cardioprotective effects rather than to a detrimental effect of the AIs on cardiovascular health. This is
supported by the lack of significant differences in lipid and
cardiovascular endpoints observed with letrozole versus placebo in the MA.17 trial (Fig. 2).38,39 A further benefit of AI
therapy is the decreased incidence of cerebrovascular events
and thromboembolic disease versus tamoxifen. Limited data
from the ATAC trial also suggest a lack of carryover effects
from AI therapy on cardiovascular health.
Cardiovascular events that occur in AI clinical trials
should continue to be monitored. Additional follow-up
should elucidate further the potential impact of AIs on
cardiovascular disease. Clearly, the rigorous safety assessments performed in the BIG 1-98 trial have set new standards in the reporting of cardiovascular data in adjuvant AI
trials, and similar safety reporting should be encouraged
in other adjuvant AI trials.14,32
There is no evidence of an overtly increased cardiovascular risk with AI therapy in relation to placebo, despite some increases in comparisons with tamoxifen. The
2005 American Society of Clinical Oncology Technology
Assessment remains accurate in its assertion that current
information is insufficient to fully assess the impact of AIs
on cardiovascular disease.57 Nevertheless, postmenopausal women who are receiving AIs remain at risk for
such complications, because they continue to live for longer periods with their disease. Like all patients who are at
risk for cardiovascular effects, these patients should be
assessed regularly and should be managed to minimize
cardiovascular risks during therapy.
