Abstract
Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor signaling is a major functional determinant of cancerassociated ﬁbroblasts (CAF). Elevated expression of PDGF receptors on stromal CAFs is associated with
metastasis and poor prognosis, but mechanism(s) that underlie these connections are not understood. Here,
we report the identiﬁcation of the secreted glycoprotein stanniocalcin-1 (STC1) as a mediator of metastasis by
PDGF receptor function in the setting of colorectal cancer. PDGF-stimulated ﬁbroblasts increased migration and
invasion of cocultured colorectal cancer cells in an STC1-dependent manner. Analyses of human colorectal
cancers revealed signiﬁcant associations between stromal PDGF receptor and STC1 expression. In an orthotopic
mouse model of colorectal cancer, tumors formed in the presence of STC1-deﬁcient ﬁbroblasts displayed reduced
intravasation of tumor cells along with fewer and smaller distant metastases formed. Our results reveal a
mechanistic basis for understanding the contribution of PDGF-activated CAFs to cancer metastasis. Cancer Res;

Introduction
Studies on metastasis have traditionally focused on properties of the malignant cells. However, recent studies in tumor
biology have shown that the tumor microenvironment exerts
major inﬂuence on tumor behavior, including the metastatic
process (1–3). Several inﬂammatory cell types of the tumor
microenvironment have been shown to affect the metastatic
capacity of the malignant cells (4). Also, vascular character-

istics, determined by properties of endothelial cells and pericytes, contribute to the formation of a more or less metastasispermissive microenvironment (5). Moreover, factors derived
from cancer-associated ﬁbroblasts (CAF) have been shown to
promote metastasis (6).
CAFs constitute a functionally important component of
tumor stroma in many types of cancer (7, 8). Clinical data
indicate that carcinomas with desmoplastic stroma, consisting of ﬁbroblast cells and extracellular matrix, are associated with a poorer prognosis, which is consistent with the
idea that CAF-derived factors stimulate invasion and metastases. Clinical associations between activated CAFs and
metastasis have also been shown through prognostic ﬁbroblast-derived gene signatures, including the core serum
response signature derived from serum-stimulated ﬁbroblasts and stroma-derived breast and lung cancer gene
signatures (9–11).
CAF-derived secreted proteins include growth factors,
cytokines, chemokines, extracellular matrix proteins, proteases, protease inhibitors, and lipid products, which may be
involved in proinvasive effect of CAFs (7, 8). Production of
these factors is generally induced by growth factors that
activate and recruit CAFs. Growth factors linked to CAF
activation include members of the TGF-b and hedgehog
families, and chemokines including CXCL14 and CCL3
(12–15).
Members of the PDGF family have also been identiﬁed as key
regulators of CAFs (16, 17). Paracrine activation of PDGF
receptors on ﬁbroblasts acts as a potent signal for tumor
stroma recruitment (18–20). Antitumor effects have been
shown following targeting of stromal PDGF receptors

(21, 22). PDGF-activated ﬁbroblasts have also been shown, in
animal tumor models, to exert a negative inﬂuence on tumor
drug uptake, presumably through effects on interstitial ﬂuid
pressure (23–27).
Recent analyses of primary tumors have established that
stromal PDGF receptor expression is associated with worse
prognosis in breast and prostate cancer (28, 29). Similar
ﬁndings have been made in studies of smaller series of colorectal cancer (21). These clinical ﬁndings indicate that PDGF
receptor–activated ﬁbroblasts are involved in cross-talk with
malignant cells that promotes metastasis. However, there have
been few experimental analyses of the potential proinvasive
effects of PDGF-activated ﬁbroblasts, and the identity of
potential PDGF-induced prometastatic factors remains
unknown.
The aim of this study was to analyze the effects of PDGFactivated ﬁbroblasts on migration and invasion of cancer cells
and to identify novel proinvasive factors induced by PDGF
activation of ﬁbroblasts.
Collectively, the studies show promigratory and -invasive
effects of PDGF-stimulated ﬁbroblasts. Importantly, stanniocalcin 1 (STC1), a poorly characterized, secreted, and hypoxiaregulated protein, was identiﬁed as a ﬁbroblast-derived mediator of the PDGF-dependent stimulatory in vitro effects. Fibroblast-derived STC1 was also shown in animal studies to
contribute to prometastatic effects of ﬁbroblasts.

Materials and Methods
Culture cells and identiﬁcation of PDGF b-receptor
expression
Colorectal tumor cell lines LIM1215, SW620, HT29 and
HCT116, immortalized ﬁbroblast BJhTERT and wild-type, and
STC1/ mouse embryonic ﬁbroblasts (MEF) were cultured
in Dulbecco's Modiﬁed Eagle's Medium (DMEM; Gibco Life
Technologies) containing 1% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum
(FCS), 2 mmol/L L-glutamine, penicillin (100 U/mL), and
streptomycin (100 ng/mL) at 37 C in a 5% CO2 humidiﬁed
atmosphere. Cells were stimulated with PDGFBB (Peprotech)
for 5 minutes at 37 C, and the expression of PDGF b-receptor
and its activation were analyzed by Western blotting using a
speciﬁc PDGF b-receptor antibody (Cell Signaling) and an
antibody against phospho-tyrosine (phospho-Y99, sc-7020,
Santa Cruz).
LIM1215, SW620, HT29, and BJhTERT cell lines were
obtained from commercial provider (Cell Bank Australia and
American Type Culture Collection). HCT116 Cell lines were
purchased from the Cancer Cell Line Repository of the Parc de
Recerca Biomedica de Barcelona (Barcelona, Spain). STC1
(þ/þ) and (/) MEFs were provided by Roger R. Reddel.
These cells were derived from previously described wild-type
and knockout STC1 C57BL/6 mice (30). MEFs were used at low
passages and without experimentally induced or spontaneous
immortalization.
Coculture assays with tumor colon cells and ﬁbroblasts
for migration and invasion assays
Colon cancer cells were cocultured with PDGF-stimulated
or nonstimulated ﬁbroblasts on 8.0 mm pore Transwells

(Costar, Corning Incorporated) without coating for migration
assays, or coated with Matrigel matrix (BD Biosciences) for
invasion assays. Before coculture, epithelial cells were labeled
with a molecular probe (Cell Tracker green CMFDA C2925,
Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's instructions, to
distinguish them from ﬁbroblasts. After 48 hours, epithelial
cells that had reached the lower surface of the ﬁlter were
recovered by trypsin treatment and counted by ﬂuorescence
with WALLAC plate reader (excitation at 485 nm and emission
at 535 nm) by interpolation using a standard curve. For
migration and invasion studies with physical separation, stimulated or nonstimulated ﬁbroblasts were seeded in the bottom
compartment of the Transwell and the labeled colon cells in
the top one.
RNA Isolation, cDNA synthesis, qRT-PCR analyses and
gene expression microarray
Analyses were conducted largely using standard procedures.
Details are given in Supplementary Information.
siRNA STC1 downregulation in BJhTERT ﬁbroblasts
BJhTERT cells were seeded under standard conditions and
transfected with either control or STC1 siRNA (Dharmacon
RNA Technologies) using DharmaFect transfection reagent
(Dharmacon RNA Technologies) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cells were then cocultured with colon
cells for invasion experiments as described above.
Colorectal cancer patients and tissue microarray
construction
The tissue microarray was derived from a populationbased cohort of 320 patients with colorectal cancer. Details
about patients and technical aspects related to the generation of the tissue microarray is provided in Supplementary
Information.
Orthotopic cell microinjection in nude mice and
histopathologic analysis of primary and disseminated
cells
The animal experiments were conducted in accordance
with National guidelines and approved by the Stockholm
North Ethical Committee on Animal Experiments. The
animal experiments and tissue analyses largely followed previously published procedures. For details, see Supplementary
Information.
PCNA, caspase-3, vimentin, Ki67, and PDGF b-receptor
immunohistochemistry and analyses of mitotic rate
Immunohistochemistry analyses, and analyses of mitotic
rate, followed established and previously published procedures. For details, see Supplementary Information.
Analyses of STC1 expression in human colorectal cancer
Sense and antisense RNA probes were generated using the
PCR primer sequences detailed in Supplementary Information
Methods. Labeled RNA probes were generated by in vitro
transcription from PCR products in the presence of digoxigenin–UTP. For in situ hybridization, tissues were digested by

Fibroblast-Derived STC1 Stimulates Metastasis

Results

Proteinase K (Roche) and incubated with digoxigenin-labeled
RNA probe. High-stringency washing was conducted after
hybridzation, followed by detection of the bound probe by
chromogenic anti-digoxigenin antibody immunohistochemistry. Blocking of various endogenous enzymes was conducted
throughout the entire process.
Establishment of primary colon cancer CAFs
Fresh tissue from primary tumors of patients operated
for colorectal cancer at Link€
oping University Hospital (Link€
oping, Sweden) was used for the propagation of primary CAFs.
Primary colon cancer CAFs were propagated from minced
tumor tissue pieces in RPMI-1640 (Fisher Scientiﬁc), supplemented with 20% FCS (Invitrogen), 10 mmol/L HEPES (Invitrogen), 30 mg/mL gentamicin (Invitrogen), and 2.5 mg/mL
Fungizone (Invitrogen). Subcultivation and experiments were
carried out in DMEM (# 21969, Gibco) with 1% or 10% FCS and
penicillin/streptomycin antibiotics in standard conditions.
CAFs were used at low passages (between 6 and 8) and without
experimentally induced or spontaneous immortalization.
Statistical analysis
All t tests were conducted following evaluation of equality
of variance or not with Levene test. Two-tailed P values 
0.05 were considered statistically signiﬁcant. Comparison of
STC1 and PDGF b-receptor expression, or Ki67, was done
with c2 test.

PDGF activation of ﬁbroblasts increases their ability of
paracrine stimulation of colon cancer cell migration and
invasion
The colon cancer cell lines, LIM1215, SW620, HT29, and
HCT116 were initially characterized with regard to expression
of PDGF b-receptors and production of their PDGF ligands. As
shown in Fig. 1A, none of the cell lines expressed PDGF
b-receptors as determined by immunoblotting. Furthermore,
none of the cultures displayed an increase in tyrosine phosphorylation following addition of exogenous PDGF. In the case
of LIM1215 cells, absence of detectable receptors was also
conﬁrmed under coculture conditions (Supplementary Fig.
S1A).
To measure the expression of PDGF ligands in colon
cancer cells, BJhTERT ﬁbroblasts were incubated with conditioned medium from the different colon cancer cell lines,
and effects on PDGF receptor phosphorylation were analyzed. This analysis showed that the colon cancer cell lines
produced different levels of PDGF ligands, with HCT116 and
SW620 cells showing the highest levels of PDGF production
and LIM1215 with the lowest levels (Supplementary Fig.
S1B). Basal levels of migration among the different epithelial
cell lines were characterized before coculture experiments.
These analyses identiﬁed HCT116 as the most migratory
cells and the LIM1215 cells as the least migratory cells
(Supplementary Fig. S1C).

Activation of the ﬁbroblasts with PDGF induced a signiﬁcant
increase in the migration of cocultured LIM1215 cells in
formats where the 2 cell types were either cultured together
in the upper chamber of a Transwell culture system (Fig. 1B) or
when ﬁbroblasts were separated from the cancer cells (Fig. 1C).
Furthermore, a PDGF dose dependency of the promigratory
effects of stimulated ﬁbroblasts were also shown (Supplementary Fig. S1D). A potent PDGF-dependent effect was also
observed on LIM1215 invasion in coculture experiments. This
was shown when the 2 cell types were cultured together in the
top chamber of the Transwell culture system (Fig. 1D).
As shown above, SW620 and HCT116 cells produced high
levels of PDGF (Supplementary Fig. S1B). Addition of exogenous PDGF ligand in cocultured ﬁbroblasts did not show a
signiﬁcant increase in the migration of HCT116 cells (Supplementary Fig. S1E). Invasion experiments were carried out,
which analyzed invasion of SW620 cells when cultured with
ﬁbroblasts in the absence or presence of the AG1296 PDGF
receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (31). As shown in Fig. 1E,
SW620 cell invasion was signiﬁcantly reduced upon PDGF
receptor inhibition.
Together, these experiments thus show PDGF-dependent
paracrine promigratory and proinvasive effects of ﬁbroblasts
on colon cancer cells.
STC1 contributes to the PDGF-induced paracrine
stimulatory effects of ﬁbroblasts on migration and
invasion of colon cancer cells
To identify mediators involved in PDGF-dependent paracrine signaling between ﬁbroblasts and colon cancer cells, the
gene expression proﬁle of nonstimulated and PDGF-stimulated BJhTERT ﬁbroblasts was analyzed by microarray analysis
(GEO Series accession number: GSE40720). STC1 was among
the most upregulated genes encoding secreted factors (see
GEO dataset). This poorly characterized, secreted hypoxiainduced protein was recently linked to ovarian cancer (32).
Furthermore, earlier studies have also linked this protein to
progression of colorectal cancer (33, 34), although negative
effect on prosurvival signaling pathways has also been
observed (35).
Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analyses of STC1
expression conﬁrmed a 15-fold STC1-induction upon PDGF
stimulation of ﬁbroblasts (Fig. 2A). On the basis of these
ﬁndings, STC1 was selected for further analyses.
Previously isolated and characterized MEFs from STC1
knockout mice (30, 35) were used to analyze the contribution
of STC1 to the PDGF-induced paracrine effects. These cells
were observed to have similar levels of expression, and ligandinduced phosphorylation, of PDGF b-receptor as wild-type
MEFs (Fig. 2B). Previous studies have reported that proliferation rate of STC1/ MEFs is increased as compared with
wild-type MEFs (35).
Analyses using the wild-type MEFs showed an increase of
invasion in LIM1215 colon cells upon coculture with PDGFactivated wild-type MEFs (Supplementary Fig. S2A). Furthermore, the wt MEFs enhanced the invasion of the PDGFproducing SW620 cells in a manner that was not affected by
PDGF but was reduced by PDGF receptor inhibitors (Supple-

mentary Fig. S2B). Together, these results support the ﬁndings
of Fig. 1, showing PDGF-dependent proinvasive effects of
ﬁbroblasts on colon cancer cells.
Importantly, experiments analyzing LM1215 cell invasion, in
the presence of PDGF stimulation, revealed signiﬁcantly lower
LIM1215 migration in the STC1/ MEF cocultures, as compared with that observed in wild-type MEF cocultures (Fig. 2C).
Experiments using SW620 and HCT116 cells also showed that
loss of STC1 signiﬁcantly reduced the invasion-stimulatory
effects of PDGF-stimulated ﬁbroblasts (Fig. 2D and E). Similar
results were observed when the promigratory effects of ﬁbroblasts on HT29 migration were analyzed (Supplementary Fig.
S2C). In some cases, the experiments with the MEF pair were
also carried out in the absence of PDGF stimulation. Also, in
this setting, the STC1/ ﬁbroblasts displayed a lower invasion-stimulatory effect than the wild-type ﬁbroblasts, but this
difference was consistently smaller than that observed in the
presence of PDGF (Fig. 2C).
To obtain independent evidence for a role of STC1 in the
paracrine proinvasive effects of ﬁbroblasts, siRNA experiments
were carried out using the BJhTERT ﬁbroblasts. As shown
in Fig. 2F, downregulation of STC1 dramatically reduced the
proinvasive effect of BJhTERT cells in cocultures with LIM1215
cells.
Together, these experiments thus identify STC1 as a previously unrecognized important mediator of PDGF-dependent
paracrine effects of ﬁbroblasts on cancer cell migration and
invasion.
PDGF b-receptor and STC1 are coexpressed in tumor
stroma of colorectal cancer
PDGF b-receptor and Ki67 were analyzed by immunohistochemistry, STC1 expression was analyzed by in situ hybridization, and expression in tumor stroma and the malignant
cells were scored separately in a tissue microarray of a population-based collection of human primary colorectal cancers.
In agreement with previous studies, PDGF b-receptor
expression was predominantly observed in the tumor stroma,
whereas variable expression of STC1 was found both in tumor
stroma and in malignant cells. When results from PDGF
b-receptor and STC1 analyses were combined, a signiﬁcant
positive association between stromal PDGF b-receptor and
stromal STC1 expression was detected (P ¼ 0.032; Fig. 3A
and B). Analyses of stroma abundance, based on a-smoothmuscle-actin (ASMA) immunohistochemistry analyses, showed that the STC1 expression was not correlated to stroma
abundance (Supplementary Fig. S3A).
To substantiate these ﬁndings, STC1 expression in primary
cultures of CAFs isolated from colon cancers was also analyzed.
Induction of STC1 was also observed in these cells following
PDGF stimulation (Fig. 3C and D). Tissue analyses in 105
patients with TMA available from both primary tumor and
normal mucosa revealed that the stromal expression of STC1
was signiﬁcantly higher in the primary tumors than in the
corresponding normal mucosa (P < 0.001). In addition, a
signiﬁcant positive correlation was observed between stromal
STC1 expression and colon cancer cell proliferation, as determined by Ki67 analysis (Fig. 3E).

Together, these analyses thus show an upregulation of STC1
in tumor stroma, as compared with normal mucosa, and also
suggest that the upregulation of STC1 in tumor stroma is
related to stromal PDGF receptor signaling and cancer cell
proliferation. No conclusive evidence was obtained concerning
associations between STC1 expression, as presently analyzed,
and survival (Supplementary Fig. S3B and S3D; see Discussion).
STC1/ ﬁbroblasts display reduced ability to support

A previously described orthotopic colon cancer model was
used to evaluate the importance of ﬁbroblast-derived STC1 for
metastasis (36). In previous studies, HCT116 cells have been
shown to recapitulate critical features of colon cancer growth
including invasion into the muscle layer, inﬁltration into
lymphatic and blood vessels, and formation of distant metastases in, for example, the liver and the lung (36).

The local tumors gave rise to poorly differentiated adenocarcinomas in both groups. They were highly cellular, including
atypical cells with pleomorphic nuclei and multinucleated

normal colon (Supplementary Fig. S4A and S4B).

groups with regard to stromal–epithelial ratio (Fig. 4B and
Supplementary Fig. S4C). Necrotic areas were also detected in
most tumors but did not differ between the 2 experimental
groups (Fig. 4B and Supplementary Fig. S4C).
Proliferation and apoptosis were evaluated in primary
tumors by mitotic ﬁgures counting and caspase-3 immunohistochemistry, respectively. Tumors derived from coinjection
with STC1/ MEFs displayed reduced proliferation and also
increased apoptosis (Fig. 4C–F). PCNA immunohistochemistry
also conﬁrmed the reduced proliferation in tumors derived
from coinjection with STC1/ MEFs (Supplementary Fig.

Vascular density was evaluated in primary tumors following
immunohistochemical analyses using Isolectin B4 antibodies.
No differences were observed between groups (Supplementary

Interestingly, there was a difference in the number of affected

signiﬁcantly smaller than those in the control group (Fig. 5B).
The potential relationship between dissemination and size
of primary tumor was also analyzed. Tumors were divided into
2 groups based on size (50% cut off), regardless of experimental

parameters differed signiﬁcantly when tumors were divided
according to size (Supplementary Fig. S7A and S7B).
Decreased lymphatic vessel density, evaluated by LYVE-1
immunohistochemistry, was also considered as a factor
contributing to the reduced metastasis in the STC1/
MEF group. A signiﬁcant decrease of lymph vessel density
was observed in primary tumors with STC1/ MEFs
(Supplementary Fig. S7C and S7D). However, a signiﬁcant
difference in lymphatic vessel density was also observed
when tumors were grouped on the basis of size (Supplementary Fig. S7E), making it difﬁcult to evaluate whether the
phenotype was secondary to the effect of STC1 on tumor
size, or reﬂected a more direct relationship between STC1
and lymphangiogenesis.

These ﬁndings thus suggest that STC1 status of ﬁbroblasts
affects metastasis by regulating the intravasating ability of
colon cancer cells.

macrophages in tumors (Supplementary Fig. S7I–S7K). A
reduction of the macrophage number was observed in the
STC1/ MEF group. However, the analyses of size-divided
tumor groups also revealed differences macrophage density,
and the differences between the experimental groups could
thus be secondary to the generally smaller size STC1/
tumors, rather than a direct consequence of the ﬁbroblast
genotype.
Vimentin immunostaining, using an antibody speciﬁc for
human vimentin, was used as an EMT cell marker. EMT was
detected in 4 of 9 tumors in the STC1þ/þ group. In contrast,
no sample in the STC1/ MEF group showed vimentin
expression (P ¼ 0.053; c2 test; Fig. 6C).
Together, these analyses suggest that STC1 directly contributes to EMT, which could be involved in the effects on
metastasis to lymph nodes and distant organs.

Discussion
In summary, this study shows that PDGF receptor stimulation of ﬁbroblasts signiﬁcantly increases migration and
invasion of cocultured colorectal cancer cells in an STC1dependent manner. The in vivo signiﬁcance of these ﬁndings
is documented by the observations that tumors with STC1/
ﬁbroblasts formed fewer and smaller distant metastases in a
manner involving reduced intravasation of tumor cells and a
reduction in cells displaying an EMT phenotype. Furthermore,
clinical relevance is indicated by the observation that PDGF
receptor and STC1 expression is signiﬁcantly correlated in the
stroma of human colorectal cancers.
A series of other studies based on tumor tissue analyses have
provided ﬁndings, which support a role for STC1 in cancer
progression and metastasis (32–34, 37). Increased levels of
circulating STC1 mRNA have also been associated with worse
prognosis in lung cancer (38).
The ﬁndings imply stromal STC1 as a prometastatic factor.
Preliminary analyses of the prognostic signiﬁcance of stromal
STC1 expression, based on the in situ analyses, showed no
prognostic effect of stromal STC1 in a multivariate analyses
including tumor stage (Supplementary Fig. S3). Surprisingly,
univariate analyses indicated an association between high
stromal STC1 and better prognosis (Supplementary Fig. S3).
These inconclusive analyses should be extended. Such studies
should particularly explore STC1 expression in the invasive
front of colorectal cancer. It should also be noted that the
present analyses relied on in situ expression analyses of
STC1, which might not reﬂect protein expression. This approach was selected because validation experiments, using various
antibodies and cells with known STC1 expression status, failed
to conﬁrm the speciﬁcity of the available antibodies. Future
studies should also address the possibility that the prognostic
signiﬁcance of stromal STC1 expression might be restricted to
certain molecular subsets of colorectal cancer.
This study, dominated by experimental ﬁndings, presents
some ﬁndings that indicate clinical relevance, including the
demonstration of a signiﬁcant association between PDGF
b-receptor expression and STC1 in a large clinical cohort.
Importantly, PDGF receptor-dependent upregulation of STC1
expression was also shown in a primary culture of colorectal

www.aacrjournals.org

CAFs. The cell culture experiments suggest that the proinvasive effects are not restricted to a particular cell line. Moreover,
the orthotopic animal model used in this study has been well
characterized and is recognized to model human colorectal
cancer well (36).
The results from the animal experiments strongly support a
stimulatory effect of ﬁbroblast-derived STC1 on metastasis to
lymph nodes and distant organs. An important topic for future
studies will be to further describe the in vivo mechanism(s) that
are most important for the prometastatic effects of STC1. On
the basis of the coculture experiments, it is likely that a
promigratory and proinvasive effect of STC1 contributes to
the prometastatic in vivo results. Furthermore, the analyses
of tumor tissue suggest that STC1 also enhances the ability of
cancer cells to intravasate. The potential involvement of
epithelial–mesenchymal transition in the STC1-dependent
differences in metastasis should be further explored on the
basis of the preliminary ﬁndings of the present study (Fig. 6C).
In the present study, no major alterations in cell type composition of tumors from the 2 groups were observed. However,
this issue should be revisited by expanded analyses of various
subsets of additional tumor stromal cells, such as ﬁbroblasts,
pericytes, and neutrophils. These future analyses should also
consider recent studies, which have implicated STC1, in noncancer models, as a regulator of inﬂammation, macrophage
mobility, and vascular permeability (39–42). Interestingly,
earlier studies have also shown that hypoxia, a prometastatic
stimuli, also leads to the upregulation of STC1 (43).
Tumors with wild-type ﬁbroblasts were signiﬁcantly larger
than the tumors with STC1/ ﬁbroblasts, and it could be
suggested that the differences in metastasis burden between
the 2 groups are secondary to differences in tumor size.
However, it should be noted that when animals were divided
according to the size of primary tumor, no signiﬁcant differences in metastasis number or size was detected. The lack of
correlation between the size of primary tumor and metastasis
is also in agreement with clinical ﬁndings showing that the size
of the primary tumor is not a consistent risk factor for
metastasis (44).
According to preliminary results (data not shown), ﬁbroblast-derived STC1 did not affect cancer cell proliferation in
vitro. However, a potential indirect effect of STC1 on cancer cell
proliferation should not be excluded since Ki67 staining of
human samples showed an association with STC1 expression
levels (Fig. 3E). Also, the results from the study of experimental
tumors support an effect on proliferation, as a decrease in
PCNA immunostaining and a reduction in the number of
mitotic ﬁgures, was observed in tumors derived from HCT116
cells coinjected with STC1 (/) MEFs (Fig. 4D and Supplementary Fig. S4D and S4E). This effect of STC1 on in vivo
proliferation should be further explored and could be secondary to the effect of interactions with other cells in the tumor
microenvironment.
The accumulating evidence suggesting an important role
of STC1 in cancer progression prompts further studies on
the molecular mechanism(s) of action of this still poorly
characterized protein. Identiﬁcation of its molecular receptor and delineation of the intracellular pathways mediating

the promigratory and -invasive effects are highly warranted.
Analyses of STC1/ ﬁbroblasts have shown that these
cells display resistance to apoptosis and higher levels of
activation of MEK and ERK1/2 than wild-type MEFs (35). To
what extent these pathways are also important in the
paracrine effects described in the present study merits
further investigations. A better characterization of the signaling involved in the PDGF-induced activation of STC1 is
also motivated. Preliminary studies with PI3K and MEK
inhibitors showed that monotreatment with either of these
agents were not sufﬁcient to signiﬁcantly reduce the PDGFinduced STC1 expression (data not shown).
The ﬁndings of the present study, in general terms, show the
importance of CAFs in modulating metastatic potential of
cancer cells. Obvious and important implications of these
ﬁndings are, ﬁrst, that inhibition of ﬁbroblast–epithelial interactions represents a strategy for interference with metastasis
and, second, that careful analyses of ﬁbroblast characteristics
should be emphasized in ongoing efforts to identify markers for
progression in colorectal and other cancers.
