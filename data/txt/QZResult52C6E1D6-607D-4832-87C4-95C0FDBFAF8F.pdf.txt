BACKGROUND: The UBE4B gene, which is located on chromosome 1p36, encodes a ubiquitin ligase that interacts with hepatocyte
growth factor-regulated tyrosine kinase substrate (Hrs), a protein involved in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) trafficking,
suggesting a link between EGFR trafficking and neuroblastoma pathogenesis. The authors analyzed the roles of UBE4B in the outcomes of patients with neuroblastoma and in neuroblastoma tumor cell proliferation, EGFR trafficking, and response to EGFR inhibition. METHODS: The association between UBE4B expression and the survival of patients with neuroblastoma was examined using
available microarray data sets. UBE4B and EGFR protein levels were measured in patient tumor samples, EGFR degradation rates
were measured in neuroblastoma cell lines, and the effects of UBE4B on neuroblastoma tumor cell growth were analyzed. The effects
of the EGFR inhibitor cetuximab were examined in neuroblastoma cells that expressed wild-type and mutant UBE4B. RESULTS: Low
UBE4B gene expression is associated with poor outcomes in patients with neuroblastoma. UBE4B overexpression reduced neuroblastoma tumor cell proliferation, and UBE4B expression was inversely related to EGFR expression in tumor samples. EGFR degradation
rates correlated with cellular UBE4B levels. Enhanced expression of catalytically active UBE4B resulted in reduced sensitivity to EGFR
inhibition. CONCLUSIONS: The current study demonstrates associations between UBE4B expression and the outcomes of patients
with neuroblastoma and between UBE4B and EGFR expression in neuroblastoma tumor samples. Moreover, levels of UBE4B influence
neuroblastoma tumor cell proliferation, EGFR degradation, and response to EGFR inhibition. These results suggest UBE4B-mediated
growth factor receptor trafficking may contribute to the poor prognosis of patients who have neuroblastoma tumors with 1p36 deletions and that UBE4B expression may be a marker that can predict responses of neuroblastoma tumors to treatment. Cancer

INTRODUCTION
Overall survival rates for children with high-risk neuroblastoma remain approximately 30% with current treatment regimens.1,2 Cases of high-risk neuroblastoma are associated with frequent relapses and tumors that are resistant to treatment,1,2 and children with refractory or recurrent neuroblastoma have poor responses to salvage therapy and very poor
survival rates.3,4 A better understanding of the mechanisms of neuroblastoma tumorigenesis will provide improved treatment options for these children.
Growth factors and their receptors play a critical role in the survival, growth, and differentiation of normal and
malignant cells, and aberrant growth factor receptor (GFR) expression and function are common features of neuroblastoma tumors. Ubiquitin-mediated sorting of activated GFRs for lysosomal degradation can regulate the amplitude and
kinetics of GFR signaling,5,6 and defects in the pathways for intracellular GFR sorting and degradation leading to altered
GFR expression and activity have been identified in many cancer types.7 Appropriate trafficking of GFRs is critical for
control of unrestrained signaling that is characteristic of transformed cells.5,6,8,9
Deletions in the short arm of chromosome 1 (chromosome 1p36) are identified in approximately one-third of neuroblastoma tumors and are associated with high-risk tumor features and a poor prognosis.10-12 The UBE4B gene is located

in the 1p36 region and encodes an E3/E4 ubiquitin
ligase.13,14 Recently, Krona and colleagues identified a
mutation in the UBE4B gene in the tumor from a patient
with neuroblastoma with a fatal outcome.15 The expression of UBE4B was shown to be markedly diminished in
a cohort of high-stage/poor-outcome tumors compared to
low-stage/favorable-outcome tumors15,16, and UBE4B
was therefore suggested to be a candidate tumor suppressor gene.15
We have observed that UBE4B interacts with hepatocyte growth factor-regulated tyrosine kinase substrate
(Hrs), a key regulator of the endosomal machinery for
GFR trafficking, and that the UBE4B-Hrs interaction is
critical for appropriate GFR trafficking and degradation.14 Therefore, loss of UBE4B expression and function
may be associated with aberrant GFR expression in neuroblastoma tumors. However, the roles of UBE4B in GFR
trafficking in neuroblastoma tumor cells and of UBE4Bmediated GFR trafficking in the outcomes of neuroblastoma patients are unknown.
We hypothesized that UBE4B would be associated
with the outcomes of patients with neuroblastoma and
with neuroblastoma tumorigenesis. To explore the roles
of UBE4B expression and function in the pathogenesis of
neuroblastoma, we evaluated the association of UBE4B
gene expression with neuroblastoma patient outcomes,
and we investigated the roles of UBE4B in neuroblastoma
tumor cell growth, in the regulation of epidermal growth
factor receptor (EGFR) expression, and in the responses
of neuroblastoma tumor cells to EGFR inhibition. The
results of these studies suggest that UBE4B-mediated
GFR trafficking may contribute to the poor prognosis of
patients who have neuroblastoma tumors with 1p36 deletions and that UBE4B expression may be a marker that
can predict responses of neuroblastoma tumors to
treatment.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell Culture

The characteristics of the neuroblastoma cell lines SMSKCNR, LA1-55N, NGP, SH-EP, SK-N-AS, SK-N-SH,
and SH-SY5Y used in this study have been described previously17-20 and were generously provided by Susan Cohn
(The University of Chicago Children’s Hospital, Chicago, Ill) and John Maris (Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pa). Cell lines used in these studies
were authenticated by DNA profiling. Neuroblastoma
cell lines were grown at 37 C in 5% CO2 in RPMI-1640
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif) supplemented with 10%
heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (USB, Minneapolis,
916

Minn), L-glutamine, sodium pyruvate, non-essential
amino acids, and penicillin/streptomycin (Sigma
Chemical Company, St. Louis, Mo).
Neuroblastoma Patient Tumor
Samples and Data

The patient tumor samples employed in these studies
were provided by the Children’s Oncology Group (COG)
Neuroblastoma Biology Committee and the Biopathology
Center in Columbus, Ohio, as previously described.21
We obtained microarray analysis results of neuroblastoma patient tumor samples from the National
Cancer Institute (NCI) Oncogenomics Data Center Section (available at: http://pob.abcc.ncicrf.gov/cgi-bin/JK;
accessed January 2012 ) from the databases ‘‘Neuroblastoma Prognosis Database,’’ ‘‘Neuroblastoma Prognosis
Database-Oberthuer Lab,’’ and ‘‘Exon Array Neuroblastoma Database.’’ These databases include patients with all
tumor stages and have information regarding N-myc gene
amplification status, and all patient data from these databases was included in our analysis. Additional studies
were performed as detailed below using results from the
‘‘Neuroblastoma Prognosis Database-Seeger Lab’’ dataset.
Cell Proliferation Assay

SK-N-AS neuroblastoma tumor cells were infected with
lentivirus constructs expressing green fluorescent protein
(GFP) alone, wild-type UBE4B, or a mutant UBE4B isoform
with
absent
ubiquitin ligase
activity
(UBE4BP1140A),13 as previously described.22 Four thousand SK-N-AS neuroblastoma cells were plated in each
well of 96-well plates in 100 lL of culture media with serum or with serum-free media supplemented with 50 ng/
mL epidermal growth factor (EGF). At baseline and after
24, 48, and 72 hours of incubation at 37 C, 10 lL of
WST-1 reagent (Roche, Indianapolis, Ind) was added to
each well in each plate, and absorbance at 450 nm was
determined.
To evaluate cell proliferation in response to cetuximab, SK-N-AS cells were plated as described above. After
assessing baseline proliferation on day 1, existing media
was discarded for all other plates, and 100 lL of media
supplemented with cetuximab (400 nM, 1 lM, or 4 lM;
provided by The University of Texas M. D. Anderson
Cancer Center pharmacy) was added to each well. Proliferation was assessed at 24, 48, and 72 hours as described
above and calculated at each time point as the percent
change in absorbance compared to baseline absorbance.
Analyses of variance analysis (ANOVA) and post hoc
Tukey tests were performed to establish significance.

EGFR Degradation Assay

For each experiment, cells at 80% confluency were incubated for 2 hours in DMEM supplemented with 1% BSA
(medium A). Media was then aspirated, and cold medium
A with EGF (50 ng/mL) was added. Plates were maintained at 4 C for 1 hour. Cells were washed 3 times with
cold medium A and were either kept on ice (0 minutes) or
incubated with warm medium A for either 30 or 60
minutes. Following incubations, cells were rinsed with
cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and scraped into
1.5 mL PBS. Samples were centrifuged at 2500g, and
cell pellets were resuspended in 30 lL lysis buffer (1 lL
each of 10 mM leupeptin, 1 lg/lL pepstatin, 0.3 mM
aprotinin, and 1.74 lg/lL phenylmethansulfonylfluroride [PMSF] per 100 lL of M-PER [Pierce, Rockford,
Ill]). The samples were incubated for 1 hour at 4 C and
then centrifuged at 15,000g.
Supernatant was collected, and 50 lg of protein
from each sample were separated by sodium dodecyl
sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE)
and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes as previously
described.21,23 Membranes were incubated in blocking
buffer (5% nonfat dry milk in PBS) and then with a rabbit
polyclonal anti-EGFR antibody (ABR, Golden, Colo;
1:1000 dilution). Proteins were visualized with ECL, and
bands were quantified using ImageJ (version 1.42;
National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md). ANOVA
and post hoc Tukey tests were performed to establish
significance.
Expression of UBE4B and EGFR in
Neuroblastoma Tumor Samples

Patient samples were homogenized using a Mikrodismembrator S (Sartorius, San Diego, Calif), then incubated for 10 minutes in protein lysis buffer containing a
phosphatase inhibitor (Sigma Chemical Company) and
protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche). Lysates were centrifuged at 15,000g, and supernatants were collected.
30 lg of protein was separated by SDS-PAGE and
transferred to nitrocellulose membranes as described
above.
The membranes were blocked in 5% milk in TBS-T
(100 mM Tris; 1.5 M NaCl; 0.1% Tween-20, pH 7.9)
and probed with antibodies directed against UBE4B,
EGFR, and actin. Proteins were visualized and quantified
as described above. Spearman’s correlation analysis was
performed on levels of UBE4B and EGFR.
Statistical Analysis

Using gene expression results from the databases
described above, patients were divided into high and low

UBE4B gene expression groups by median-centered log2
ratios as detailed on the NCI Oncogenomics database
website. The high-expression group contained 177
patients, and the low-expression group contained 176
patients. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were plotted using
the open-source statistical packages in R (R Foundation
for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria; available at:
http://www.r-project.org; [accessed January 2012]). We
compared survival curves between the UBE4B gene
expression groups using log-rank tests to examine the
association between expression and patient survival outcomes in the whole cohort and in patients with stage 4
neuroblastoma and in those with stage 1, 2, 3, or 4S neuroblastoma. Fisher’s exact test was performed to determine whether the proportion of tumors with N-myc gene
amplification was associated with UBE4B gene expression. For separate analyses of the Neuroblastoma Prognosis Database-Seeger Lab dataset, the median-centered log2
ratios for each of 7 probes for UBE4B were standardized
to have a mean of zero and unit length by location and
scale transformation. The standardized log2 ratios were
averaged across all 7 probes. Based on the average of log2
ratios for each patient, 50 and 52 patients were in the low
and high UBE4B expression groups, respectively.
RESULTS
Association of UBE4B Gene Expression With
Neuroblastoma Patient Outcomes

Due to the location of the UBE4B gene and its low expression in advanced neuroblastoma tumors,16 loss of UBE4B
expression and function may be critical for neuroblastoma
tumorigenesis. Therefore, we evaluated the association of
UBE4B gene expression with neuroblastoma patient outcomes using results from microarray analyses of 353 neuroblastoma tumors obtained from the NCI as detailed above.
Low expression of UBE4B was significantly associated with
poor outcomes of patients with neuroblastoma
(P < .00001) (Fig. 1a) and with worse outcomes in patients
with either stage 4 disease (P ¼ .007) or with stage 1, 2, 3,
and 4S disease (P < .00001) (Fig. 1b). Additionally, amplification of the N-myc oncogene was only seen in 2 of 177
patients with high UBE4B gene expression, as opposed to 43
of 176 with low UBE4B expression (P < .00001) (Fig. 2a),
indicating an association of N-myc gene amplification with
low UBE4B expression. These results demonstrate that
UBE4B expression is associated with the outcomes of
patients with neuroblastoma.
To evaluate the prognostic relevance of UBE4B
expression in patients with neuroblastoma tumors without N-myc gene amplification, we separately analyzed the

outcomes of the 308 patients with neuroblastoma without
N-myc gene amplification in these databases. Low UBE4B
expression was significantly associated with lower survival
rates in these patients (P < .00001) (Fig. 2b), suggesting
that UBE4B expression is prognostically relevant in this
subset of patients. For further confirmation of the prognostic value of UBE4B gene expression in patients who
have neuroblastoma without N-myc amplification, we independently evaluated the association of UBE4B expression with patient survival in the Neuroblastoma Prognosis
Database-Seeger Lab, a database with results from patients
with neuroblastoma without N-myc gene amplification.24
In these 102 patients, low UBE4B expression was also significantly associated with lower survival rates (P < .05)
(Fig. 2c), confirming the association of UBE4B gene
expression with overall survival in patients who have neuroblastoma without N-myc amplification.
Effects of UBE4B on Neuroblastoma Cell
Proliferation

We then explored the mechanisms by which UBE4B
might affect neuroblastoma patient outcomes. To investigate the effects of UBE4B on neuroblastoma tumor cell
proliferation, SK-N-AS neuroblastoma tumor cells
infected with lentivirus constructs expressing GFP alone,
wild-type UBE4B, or UBE4BP1140A, a mutant isoform
with absent ubiquitin ligase activity,13 were grown in
media supplemented with either 10% FBS or 50 ng/mL
EGF. Wild-type UBE4B expression, but not expression
918

of the UBE4BP1140A mutant, resulted in reduced neuroblastoma tumor cell proliferation under both conditions
(P < .05) (Fig. 3), suggesting that UBE4B expression and,
more specifically, UBE4B ubiquitin ligase function can
reduce neuroblastoma tumor cell proliferation.
Association of UBE4B and EGFR Protein Levels

Aberrant GFR expression and function have been shown
to be important in the pathogenesis of neuroblastoma.25-30
We have observed that the UBE4B protein interacts with
Hrs, a key regulator of EGFR endosomal trafficking and
degradation,31-34 and that the Hrs-UBE4B interaction is
critical for efficient GFR trafficking and degradation,14
suggesting that UBE4B expression and function may be
associated with EGFR expression in neuroblastoma tumor
cells. Therefore, we evaluated a cohort of 20 neuroblastoma tumor samples from the Children’s Oncology
Group (COG) for expression of UBE4B and EGFR proteins by quantitative Western blot analysis. UBE4B protein expression was inversely correlated with EGFR
protein expression in these patient samples (Spearman’s
correlation [q] ¼ 0.4545; P < .05) (Fig. 4), suggesting a
possible role for UBE4B in the regulation of EGFR levels
in neuroblastoma tumors.

degradation rates of EGFR in neuroblastoma cell lines.
Total UBE4B protein levels were measured in a panel of
neuroblastoma tumor cells at baseline by quantitative
Western blot analysis (Fig. 5a). To measure EGFR degradation rates in neuroblastoma tumor cells, cells with
high (LA1-55N, SH-SY5Y) or low (SK-N-SH, SK-NAS) UBE4B levels were briefly starved in serum-free
media and then stimulated with EGF. Total cellular
EGFR levels were then measured over the subsequent 60
minutes. Neuroblastoma tumor cells with higher levels
of UBE4B had faster rates of EGFR degradation compared to those with lower UBE4B levels (Fig. 5b-e), suggesting that UBE4B affects EGFR levels through
regulation of EGFR degradation.

cetuximab resulted in significant inhibition of neuroblastoma tumor cell proliferation (Fig. 6a) (P < .01). To
investigate the role of UBE4B in the cetuximab-mediated
inhibition of cell proliferation, parental neuroblastoma
tumor cells or cells infected with lentivirus vectors expressing wild-type UBE4B, the UBE4BP1140A mutant, or GFP
were grown as described above and treated with 4 lM
cetuximab. Overexpression of UBE4B, but not of the
ligase-deficient mutant, resulted in loss of the cetuximabmediated inhibition of proliferation (Fig. 6b), suggesting
a role for UBE4B expression and its ubiquitin ligase activity in the response of neuroblastoma tumor cells to EGFR
inhibition.

Association of UBE4B With Neuroblastoma
Tumor Cell Response to EGFR Inhibition

DISCUSSION
Children with high-risk neuroblastoma have extremely
poor outcomes, and additional understanding of the pathways involved in neuroblastoma pathogenesis will assist in
the development of improved therapies. The UBE4B gene
is located in chromosome 1p36, a commonly deleted
chromosomal region in neuroblastoma tumors, and
UBE4B interacts with proteins involved in the trafficking
of GFRs that ultimately results in their lysosomal

The association of UBE4B levels with EGFR degradation
and with total EGFR levels suggested that UBE4B levels
may also be associated with the response of neuroblastoma
tumor cells to EGFR inhibitors. To investigate this possibility, neuroblastoma tumor cells were treated with a
range of concentrations of cetuximab, an FDA-approved
inhibitory antibody to EGFR. Treatment with 4 lM

trafficking in neuroblastoma pathogenesis. Our results
demonstrate an association between UBE4B gene expression and neuroblastoma patient outcomes and of UBE4B
function with neuroblastoma tumor cell proliferation and
response to EGFR inhibitors.
A number of genes located within the 1p36 region
have been proposed as tumor suppressors in neuroblastoma and other tumors, including chromdomain helicase
DNA binding protein 5 (CHD5),35 calmodulin binding
transcription activator 1 (CAMTA1),36,37 microRNA34a,38,39 castor zinc finger 1 (CASZ1),40 kinesin family
member 1B (KIF1B),41,42 and the hairy and enhancer of
split-1 (HES) gene family.43 Studies are ongoing to deter920

mine the role of UBE4B expression and function in other
tumors with 1p36 aberrations. Alterations of the chromosome 1p36 region are found in a wide range of tumors,
including brain tumors, breast cancers, and leukemias,
and are often associated with aggressive tumor features
and a poor prognosis.44 In medulloblastoma tumor cells,
UBE4B has been shown to induce degradation of p53,45
suggesting a potential role for UBE4B in tumorigenesis
independent of its effect on EGFR trafficking, and
studies are ongoing to investigate the role of UBE4B
in the trafficking of other transmembrane proteins in
neuroblastoma.
EGF-induced signaling has been shown to be important in the pathogenesis of a variety of malignancies,
and EGFR inhibitors are currently in use for cancer treatment.46 EGFR expression has been documented in neuroblastoma tumors and cell lines, and inhibition of EGFR
signaling has been shown to reduce the growth of neuroblastoma tumor cells in vitro and in vivo.21,30,47 Cetuximab has been shown to be effective against a variety of
tumor cell lines, with 50% inhibitory concentration
(IC50) values between 10 nM and 10 lM.48 Therefore,
our identified effective dose of 4 lM fits within the
observed cancer cell sensitivity range.
Previous studies have demonstrated that EGFR
expression is associated with chemotherapy resistance in
neuroblastoma cells and that chemotherapy is synergistic
with EGFR inhibitors.47,49 Additional studies have identified EGFR ubiquitination and degradation as a mechanism for colon cancer cell resistance to cetuximab.50 The

mechanisms responsible for this association of EGFR
with resistance to chemotherapy in neuroblastoma tumor
cells are unknown. We have demonstrated that overexpression of UBE4B resulted in reduced sensitivity to
cetuximab (Fig. 6), implicating UBE4B and the GFR trafficking pathway in the sensitivity of neuroblastoma tumor
cells to treatment with EGFR inhibitors. These data also
suggest that UBE4B-mediated GFR trafficking, through
regulation of EGFR expression, may be responsible for

ance. However, the mechanisms by which alterations in
UBE4B expression and GFR trafficking might affect neuroblastoma tumor cell responses to therapy are unknown,
and a better understanding of these mechanisms will likely
lead to improved efficacy of current therapy and allow for
identification of patient populations that might be more
or less sensitive to GFR inhibitor treatment.
The results of these studies provide important information about the previously undescribed roles and mechanisms of GFR trafficking in neuroblastoma tumor cells

and of the UBE4B protein in neuroblastoma tumor cell
proliferation and response to treatment. Our results have
identified a previously undiscovered link between GFR
trafficking and neuroblastoma pathogenesis, and the correlation between UBE4B and EGFR levels we describe in
neuroblastoma tumors may be relevant for multiple tumor types with known 1p36 alterations in which EGFR
inhibition is therapeutically effective. We have demonstrated associations between UBE4B expression and neuroblastoma patient outcomes, and we have shown that
levels of UBE4B influence neuroblastoma tumor cell proliferation, EGFR trafficking, and response to EGFR inhibition. Our results suggest that inhibition of UBE4Bmediated GFR degradation may contribute to the poor
prognosis for patients who have neuroblastoma tumors
with 1p36 deletions and that UBE4B expression may be a
marker that can predict responses of neuroblastoma
tumors to treatment. The roles of UBE4B levels as a prognostic marker for treatment response and of UBE4Bmediated EGFR degradation as a mechanism for resistance to EGFR inhibition are currently being explored.
These results demonstrate a novel pathway with the
potential for targeted drug development and a novel
mechanism for tumor treatment sensitivity that may provide a prognostic marker to identify a patient population
most likely to respond to inhibition of GFRs.
