ABSTRACT
Disulfiram (DSF), an anti-alcoholism drug, has been reported as an inhibitor of
NF-κB. NF-κB is involved in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and ­self-renewal
of breast cancer stem cells (CSCs). In this study, we treated MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231
breast cancer cells with TGF-β to induce EMT and cancer stem-like features and
studied whether DSF can reverse this process. We found that DSF inhibited TGF-β
induced EMT in breast cancer cells in a dose-dependent manner. Also, DSF inhibited
EMT-associated stem-like features, migration and invasion of tumor cells as well as
tumor growth in xenograft model. The activation of NF-κB was linked with EMT and
stem-like cells. We conclude that DSF can suppress NF-κB activity and downregulate
ERK/NF-κB/Snail pathway, leading to reverse EMT and stem-like features. Our
data suggest that DSF inhibits EMT and stem-like properties in breast cancer cells
associated with inhibition of the ERK/NF-κB/Snail pathway.

E-cadherin, and upregulated expression of mesenchymal
markers, such as vimentin. Emerging evidence suggests
that EMT endows cells not only with migratory and
invasive properties, but also with stem cell properties
[11, 12]. Recent studies have demonstrated that EMT
promotes the generation of stem-like cells from
differentiated neoplastic cells [13, 14].
Cancer stem cells (CSCs) or cancer stemlike cells [15] have been considered as a crucial
role in tumorigenesis, tumor metastasis, chemo- and
radiotherapy resistance, and recurrence [16]. Although
CSCs constitute a small minority of neoplastic cells
within a tumor, they are believed to possess pluripotent
and self-renewal capacity, thereby generating a
heterogeneous cell population of the originating tumor,
seeding at distant sites and driving the formation of
macrometastasis. The induction of EMT in immortalized
human mammary epithelial cells results in the acquisition
of stem-like traits and in the expression of stem cell
markers, a CD44+/CD24− antigen phenotype [13]. The
CD44+/CD24− expression pattern has been implicated
in both human breast CSCs and normal epithelial stem

INTRODUCTION
Breast cancer is the most common malignant tumor
in female, and metastasis is the leading cause of cancer
related death [1]. In spite of many advances such as HER2 or VEGF targeting medicines, median overall survival of
patients with advanced breast cancer is still only 2–3 years
[2]. Therefore, there is a great need for novel mechanistic
understanding of tumor metastasis, which would be
critical for developing more effective therapies.
Epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) is
a fundamental process for morphogenesis during
embryonic development, tissue remodeling and wound
healing [3, 4], but more recently it has also been
implicated in cancer progression and metastasis [5–7].
Moreover, EMT can be induced by external signals, such
as transforming growth factor (TGF)-β, which has been
mainly used as an EMT inducer in various experimental
studies [8–10]. The most prominent characteristic of
EMT is the morphological alteration from epithelial
to mesenchymal, which is often accompanied by the
downregulated expression of epithelial markers, such as

cells [17, 18]. Aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) is also
considered as an important marker for CSCs and refers to
the metastasis and recurrence for breast cancer [19, 20].
The cell population bearing both ALDH+ and CD44+/
CD24− CSCs phenotypes has been reported that had high
tumorigenic capacity [19]. Targeting both ALDH+ and
CD44+/CD24− phenotypes to eradicate CSCs might be
more effective.
It appears that there is a tight link between
the EMT and the generation of stem-like cells. Is
there any shared signal pathway between these two
critical process involving metastasis? Recent studies
demonstrated that the transcription factor NF-κB plays
an essential role in the induction and maintenance of
EMT [21, 22] as well as in the regulation of self-renewal
capacity of breast CSCs [23]. Blockade of ERK/NFκB in peritoneal mesothelial cells has been reported to
inhibit the expression of the transcription factor Snail1,
a potent inducer of EMT, and revert cells to epithelioid
morphology [24]. However, the role of ERK/NF-κB/
Snail1 in breast cancer cells has not been elucidated.
Investigation of the changes of ERK/NF-κB/Snail
pathway in breast cancer during EMT might provide
novel strategies for treatment of breast cancer.
As a member of the dithiocarbamate family,
disulfiram (DSF) has been safely used for the treatment
of alcohol abuse for over sixty years. Increasing
evidence suggests that the old drug has a bright new
future, exhibiting potent anticancer effects by inducing
apoptosis, reducing angiogenesis, suppressing tumor
growth, and reversing drug-resistance [25, 26]. Most
importantly, as a novel proteasome inhibitor, DSF also
inhibits nuclear translocation and DNA binding activity
of NF-κB in certain kinds of cancer [25, 27]. It has
been demonstrated that the proteasome inhibitor, NPI0052 renders cells resistant to TGF-α induced EMT by
inhibition of NF-κB activation [28]. Thus, we deduced
that DSF might have the similar effects on regulation of
TGF-β induced EMT as NPI-0052 does. Recent studies
reported that DSF can markedly inhibit the proliferation
and self-renewal of glioma stem cells by inhibiting NFκB pathway [29–31]. Moreover, DSF is an irreversible
inhibitor of ALDH, and therefore it might also be an
inhibitor of ALDH-positive CSCs in breast cancer
[32–34]. Nevertheless, whether DSF might overcome
both EMT and stem-like characteristics in breast cancer
through inhibiting NF-κB and ALDH activity is unknown
thus far.
In this study, we demonstrate that DSF can reverse
TGF-β induced EMT and stem-like properties of breast
cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. Blockade of ERK/
NF-κB/Snail pathway actively suppressed the EMT,
migration, invasion, and stem-like features in breast
cancer cells. Our results provide supporting evidence to
warrant further clinical trial for DSF as a safe and potent
anticancer drug.

DSF inhibits TGF-β-induced EMT in breast
cancer cells
To ensure that DSF-blocked TGF-β induced EMT
was not due to cell death or inhibition of proliferation,
we initially determined subtoxic DSF concentrations
for MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells by performing
MTT assay (Figure 1A). A range of DSF concentrations
(5, 10, 15 μM) were chosen to be used in the following
experiments. Cells were pretreated with DSF for 24 h with
increasing concentrations (5 μM, 10 μM, 15 μM) prior
to stimulation with TGF-β (10 ng/ml) for 24 h. We first
observed the morphological change, which is indicative
of EMT. As shown in Figure 1B, TGF-β induced MCF-7
and MDA-MB-231 cells undergoing EMT process along
with acquiring fibroblast-like, mesenchymal morphology,
and DSF treatment inhibited TGF-β induced EMT in a dose
dependent manner. After 24 h treatment with increasing
concentrations of DSF, these cells kept a more epitheliallike appearance even induced by TGF-β. To further clarify
whether abolishment of TGF-β-induced EMT in DSF
treated cells resulted from dysregulation of EMT related
proteins, we already examined the expression patterns
of epithelial marker E-cadherin as well as the expression
of the mesenchymal markers, vimentin and N-cadherin.
The protein levels were assessed by immunofluorescence
staining and western blot assay. As anticipated, DSF
significantly suppressed the TGF-β induced upregulation
of vimentin and N-cadherin as well as downregulation
of E-cadherin in a dose-dependency (Figure 1C and 1D).
These findings suggest that DSF can inhibit TGF-β induced
EMT by modifying the expression of EMT related proteins.

DSF targets stem-like cells generated
by induction of TGF-β
There is a tight link between EMT and stem-like
cells, where cells undergoing EMT acquire properties
of stem cells [14]. In our experiment, induction of EMT
in breast cancer cells by exposure of TGF-β resulted in
the acquisition of stem-like expression pattern (ALDH+,
CD24− /CD44+) and self-renewal capacity (Figure 2). To
determine the targeting effect of DSF on stem-like cells,
the expression changes of breast CSCs markers were
analyzed. ALDEFLUOR assay indicated that the ALDH+
cell population was significantly decreased in DSF treated
cells in a dose-dependent fashion. As shown in Figure 2A,
TGF-β treatment increased the ALDH+ cells from 1.34 ±
0.22% to 48.72 ± 0.67% (P < 0.05) in MCF-7 cells and
from 4.76 ± 1.13% to 65.88 ± 1.20% (P < 0.05) in MDAMB-231 cells. However, DSF reversed the effects of TGF-β
and decreased the ALDH+ cells from 48.72 ± 0.67% to 5.31
± 0.52% (P < 0.05) in MCF-7 cells and from 65.88 ± 1.20%
to 10.97 ± 1.17% (P < 0.05) in MDA-MB-231 cells.

DSF suppresses TGF-β induced cell migration
and invasion

The results of immunofluorescence staining and
western blot showed DSF significantly suppressed the
TGF-β induced upregulation of CD44 and downregulation
of CD24 in a dose-dependency (Figure 2B and 2C). We
further investigated the effect of DSF on self-renewal
capacity by mammosphere formation assay. When cells
were treated with TGF-β, the efficiency of mammospheres
forming was significantly increased, whereas the sphereforming ability was almost completely abolished after 24 h
exposure to DSF (Figure 2D). These findings strongly
support that DSF is able to inhibit stem-like properties.

The functional significance of DSF inhibiting
the expression profiles of the above EMT-related gene
products was expected to be reflected in the cell migration
and invasion. To evaluate the alteration of tumor cell
migratory and invasive properties, wound-healing and
transwell-based assays were performed. As anticipated,
DSF significantly suppressed both the tumor cell migration
(Figure 3A and 3C) and invasion (Figure 3D). TGF-β

promoted MCF-7 cells migration and invasion, whereas
this tendency was blocked by DSF in a dose-dependent
manner. We further detected the invasion-related proteins
MMPs (MMP-1 and MMP-3). The data indicated that DSF
significantly suppressed the TGF-β induced upregulation
of MMP-1 and MMP-3 (Figure 3B). These results suggest
that the induction of TGF-β could encourage migration
and invasion, and this process could be dramatically
blocked by DSF.

Increasing evidence suggests that transcription factor
NF-κB plays a critical role in the induction and maintenance
of EMT, as well as in the expansion of breast CSCs [20–
22]. Therefore, we examined the inhibitory effect of DSF
on NF-κB by assessing its nuclear translocation and DNA
binding activity. Shown in Figure 4A, NF-κB p65 nuclear
translocation was induced by TGF-β, while TGF-β induced

p65 nuclear translocation was blocked by DSF. Western
blot results showed that DSF suppressed the TGF-β
induced upregulation of NF-κB p65 protein and prevented
the TGF-β triggered IκBα degradation (Figure 4B). The
NF-κB p65 nuclear translocation and IκBα degradation
critically influence NF-κB DNA binding activity. EMSA
results showed DSF inhibited TGF-β mediated NF-κB DNA
binding affinity (Figure 4C).
We analyzed upstream signaling that might attribute
to NF-κB activation in our experimental setting. The
activation of the ERK contributes to the regulation of
NF-κB activity during TGF-β induced EMT [35]. As
expected, TGF-β treatment increased the expression of
ERK and phosphorylation of ERK. However, these effects
were blocked by DSF (Figure 4D). We also analyzed
downstream signaling of NF-κB that might account for
TGF-β induced EMT and stem-like cells. Snail has been
reported to be upregulated partly by NF-κB and TGF-β
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

[36, 37], and it is a transcription factor involving EMT
and CSC regulations [38]. Our data indicated that the
expression of Snail was induced by TGF-β, but suppressed
by DSF in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 4D). These
findings suggest that DSF inhibits the ERK/NF-κB/Snail
pathway, resulting in inhibition of TGF-β-mediated EMT,
self-renewal, migration and invasion.

Direct role of ERK/NF-κB/Snail pathway
repression on the reverse of TGF-β induced
EMT, stem-like properties, migration and
invasion
The direct role of ERK/NF-κB/Snail pathway
repression on the regulation of TGF-β induced EMT,
stem-like properties, migration and invasion was
determined by using U0126, a chemical inhibitor of
MEK1/2 - the upstream activator of ERK. As Figure 5A

shown, it is easy to observe that U0126 blocks the ERK/
NF-κB/Snail pathway surely with related proteins ERK,
p-ERK, NF-κB and Snail downregulation, accompanied
with IκB-α accumulation. Concomitant with the effect
of DSF on the expression profiles of EMT and CSCs,
U0126 treatment markedly inhibited the TGF-β induced
EMT morphologically (Figure 5B) and biochemically,
along with increased expression of E-cadherin and
reduced levels of N-cadherin and vimentin (Figure 5A).
U0126 also inhibited the expression of breast CSCs
markers with upregulation of CD24 and downregulation
of CD44, along with suppressing self-renewal capability
of TGF-β treated cell (Figure 5A and 5C). Moreover,
U0126 significantly suppressed the TGF-β induced
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

migration and invasion with downregulation of MMP-1
and MMP-3 (Figure 5D–5G). These results corroborated
the above findings in DSF treated cells and confirmed
the role of ERK/NF-κB/Snail pathway in the inhibitory
effect of DSF on the EMT and CSCs phenotypes.

as compared to the control group, but DSF strongly
inhibited this tendency (Figure 6B). The data suggest that
exogenous TGF-β facilitates tumor growth as it happens
in vitro, but DSF efficiently inhibits tumor growth, which
completely eliminates the effect of TGF-β. Importantly,
we found significantly fewer metastatic nodules in liver
tissues of mice treated with DSF than in mice treated with
PBS or TGF-β. Metastases in the liver of mice carrying
tumors were confirmed by H& E staining (Figure 6C,
upper). The average tumor metastatic nodules per field

were 4.75 in TGF-β group, whereas nearly no metastatic
nodules (N = 0.3) was detected in DSF group (Figure 6C,
lower) (P < 0.001).
We next performed immunohistochemical
detection of EMT and CSCs markers in tumor tissues.
The changes of epithelial and mesenchymal makers and
loosely organization structures indicated that exogenous
TGF-β could indeed arouse EMT in vivo, along with the
activation of ERK/NF-κB/Snail pathway. As it did in vitro,

DISCUSSION

proteins expression and downregulated ERK/NF-κB/Snail
pathway (Figure 6D and 6G). DSF also suppressed TGF-β
induced CD44 upregulation and CD24 downregulation
(Figure 6E), suggesting that DSF may inhibit stem-like
features in vivo but further studies are needed. Taken
together, these data suggest that DSF suppresses tumor
growth and metastasis in vivo via ERK/NF-κB/Snail
pathway.

Metastasis is the leading cause responsible for
treatment failure in breast cancer. Both the EMT and
CSCs are considered as a crucial role contributing to
tumor recurrence and metastasis [39]. Growing evidence
suggests that EMT endows cells not only with migratory
and invasive properties, but also with stem cell properties
40914

Oncotarget

[11–14, 40]. Agents that inhibit the EMT program may
serve as dual inhibitors by not only inhibiting tumor cell
invasion and metastasis but also inhibiting the generation
of stem-like cells via EMT. In the present study, we found
that DSF, a drug used to treat alcoholism, is such an agent
that may serve as the dual inhibitors for EMT and CSCs.
Our results demonstrated that DSF can effectively reverse
TGF-β induced EMT and stem-like properties of breast
cancer cells by targeting NF-κB signaling pathway in vitro
and in vivo.
Although the anticancer effects of DSF have been
known for many years [41], very little is known about
the activity of this drug on EMT and stem-like cells in
breast cancer. First, we examined the potential EMTinhibitory activity of DSF by checking the cellular
morphological changes and alterations of EMT-related
markers expression. We found that DSF can reverse the
TGF-β induced EMT program in a dose-dependent manner
in vitro and in mice model. Second, we examined the
potential inhibitory effect of DSF on stem-like properties
in breast cancer cells. Our results showed that DSF can
inhibit the self-renewal capability of breast cancer cells,
and reverse the expression of breast CSC markers, such
as ALDH, CD44 and CD24. Third, we found that DSF
effectively inhibited tumor cell migration and invasion
through modulation of MMP-1 and MMP-3 expression.
DSF also significantly inhibited tumor growth and
metastasis in mice model. Of notable importance, our data
indicate that DSF alone was highly effective to against
EMT and cells with stem-like properties in breast cancer.
Previous studies demonstrate that the anticancer
activity of DSF was in a metal (especially copper)dependent manner. Since DSF is a member of the
dithiocarbamate family, as a chelator, DSF strongly
chelates copper, zinc and some other bivalent metals
to form DSF/bivalent metal-complex [42, 43]. In
combination with copper, DSF forms DSF/copper complex
which is highly cytotoxic to breast cancer, glioblastoma,
melanoma and colon cancer cells [29, 32, 43, 44]. In
addition, DSF/copper complex was reported to be able
to induce apoptosis, reduce angiogenesis, suppress tumor
growth, and reverse drug-resistance [26]. However, most
recent studies revealed that both DSF/copper complex and
DSF alone appear to effectively target glioblastoma and
breast cancer cells with cancer-stem-like properties [29–
34]. DSF alone, even at a concentration as low as 100 nM,
suppressed self-renewal of glioblastoma and was highly
effective in cells that are refractory to temozolomide
[30]. Studies in breast cancer reported that DSF may
target breast cancer cells with CSC-like properties by
modulating NF-κB pathway [32, 34]. These findings are in
line with our results. Here, we demonstrated the inhibitory
activity of DSF on breast cancer stem-like cells in the
absence of metal supplementation. Furthermore, to our
best knowledge, this is the first time to report the efficacy
of DSF on inhibition of EMT in breast cancer.
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

The molecular anticancer mechanisms of DSF
remain unclear. Our data showed that DSF inhibited NFκB activity by preventing degradation of its inhibitor IκBα
and inhibiting its nuclear translocation and DNA binding
activity. Our results are in line with previous studies.
DSF has been reported as a novel proteasome inhibitor,
and its inhibitory effects on NF-κB pathway have been
investigated in colorectal cancer, glioblastoma, and breast
cancer [25, 29, 43]. In recent studies, DSF has been
shown potent inhibition of breast CSCs by simultaneous
induction of ROS and inhibition of NF-κB [32, 34]. NFκB plays a critical role in the induction and maintenance of
EMT, as well as in the regulation of self-renewal capacity
of breast CSCs. The activation of the ERK contributes to
the regulation of NF-κB activity during TGF-β induced
EMT [24, 35]. Blockade of ERK/NF-κB/Snail can reverse
TGF-β induced EMT in peritoneal mesothelial cells [24].
Our results demonstrated the inhibitory effect of DSF on
ERK/NF-κB/Snail pathway, and direct role of inhibition
of ERK/NF-κB/Snail on the regulation of EMT and CSCs
in breast cancer was tested by U0126, a chemical inhibitor
of MEK1/2 - the upstream activator of ERK. Concordant
with the effects of DSF on the expression profile of EMT
and CSCs, U0126 treatment leaded to the reversion of
EMT and stem-like properties, and the suppression of
invasion and migration. These findings strongly suggested
that DSF inhibited EMT and cancer stem-like cells by
targeting ERK/NF-κB/Snail pathway.
DSF is widely reported as an inhibitor of ALDH, a
surrogate marker of CSCs [19]. Our results demonstrated
that DSF treatment suppressed the expression of breast
CSCs markers (ALDH+, CD44+/CD24−), and abolished
the sphere-forming ability in breast cancer cells at a
concentration of 10–15 μM. However, several studies
reported that DSF alone did not show any inhibitory effect
on ALDH activity [29, 32]. The discrepancy between
others and this study may be due to the different DSF
concentrations. Much lower concentrations (500 nM,
1 μM) were used in these studies for evaluation of DSF
against CSCs. Although data obtained here suggest that
DSF may inhibit ALDH positive cell populations, further
studies are needed to evaluate the contribution of ALDH
activity to breast CSCs death. It also should be noted
that aldehyde dehydrogenases are a superfamily with 19
isoenzymes. The ALDH1A1 and ALDH1A3 isoforms
have been identified as major markers of breast CSCs [19,
45]. However, it was recently demonstrated that DSF/
copper has potent inhibitory action on ALDH enzyme
activity, but has no effect on the mRNA and protein
expression of ALDH isoeznymes (1A1, 1A3, 2 and 3A1)
[34]. Triscott and colleagues [30] also reported that DSF
inhibits ALDH activity, but its effect on glioblastoma
stem-like cells may be not through ALDH inhibition.
DSF has been safely used to control alcoholism
for over sixty years, and its anticancer effects are being
investigated for other malignancies in clinical trials.

Boster, Wuhan, China) in the dark for 1 h at 37°C,
counterstained with DAPI. Images were collected using
an Olympus Fluoview FV1000 laser-scanning confocal
microscope.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell lines and cell culture
Human breast cancer cell lines MCF-7 and MDAMB-231 were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA,
USA). Cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle
medium (DMEM, Hyclone) supplemented with 10% heatinactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS, Hyclone), in a 37°C
humidified environment containing 5% CO2.
Cells were cultured to 60% confluence, and
subsequently exposed to DSF at indicated concentrations
for 24 h followed by TGF-β (10 ng/ml) treatment for
another 24 h.

Western blot
The cells were trypsinized and cultured in 6-well
plates and treated by drugs. The cells were washed with
4°C PBS twice and lysed in RIPA Buffer. Then the lysate
was centrifuged for 15 minutes and the supernatants
retained. The protein extracts were separated on 12% SDSPAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes. Membranes
were blocked with 5% nonfat milk in 0.1% TBST for 1 h
and then incubated with primary antibodies as previously
described over night at 4°C, followed by incubation with
secondary antibodies (1:5000 dilution, Boster, Wuhan,
China). The signals were detected by SuperSignal West
Pico Chemiluminescence Substrate (Pierce, USA). Equal
protein sample loading was monitored by probing the
same membrane with antibodies against β-actin.

Reagents and antibodies
DSF was purchased from Sigma (USA) and
dissolved in DMSO. TGF-β was purchased from
Peprotech (USA) and dissolved in 10 mM citric acid,
PH3.0 to a concentration of 0.1–1.0 mg/ml. U0126 was
purchased from Selleck Chemicals (USA) and dissolved
in 10% DMSO, 30% Cremophor EL and 60% PBS to a
concentration of 10 mM.
The following primary antibodies were used: antiE-cadherin (WB: 1:1000, IF:1:200, IHC:1:400 dilution,
CST), anti-vimentin (WB: 1:1000, IF:1:100, IHC:1:100
dilution, CST), anti-N-cadherin (WB: 1:1000 dilution,
CST), anti-Snail (WB: 5 ng/ml, IF:10 μg/ml, IHC: 10
μg/ml , R&D Systems), anti-NF-κB/p65 (WB: 1:1000,
IF:1:50, IHC:1:800 dilution, CST), anti-ERK (WB: 1:500,
IF:1:50, IHC:1:50, dilution, Boster, Wuhan, China), antip-ERK (WB: 1:1000, IF:1:200,IHC:1:400 dilution, CST),
anti-IκB-α (WB:1:500, IF: 1:50, IHC:1:50 dilution, Anbo,
USA), anti-CD24 (WB: 1:200, IF:1:50 dilution, Santa
Cruz), anti-CD24 (IHC:1:50 dilution, Abcam), anti-CD44
(WB:1:1000, IF:1:200, IHC:1:50 dilution, CST), antiMMP-1 (WB:1:200 dilution, Santa Cruz), anti-MMP-3
(WB:1:200 dilution, Santa Cruz).

Wound-healing assay
Cells were seeded in a 6-well plate to form a
confluent monolayer in complete medium. The monolayer
was pretreated with the indicated concentrations of DSF
for 24 h before being scratched by a plastic tip. Wounded
monolayers were washed by PBS to remove cell debris,
followed by exposure to TGF-β (10 ng/ml) for another
24 h. Wound closure was monitored under microscopy at
× 100 magnification.

In vitro migration and invasion assays
Transwell (Corning Costar, Cambridge, MA, USA)
upper chamber were coated with matrigel (BD, USA) for
invasion assay or without matrigel for migration assay.
The cells were incubated with the indicated concentrations
of DSF for 24 h and seeded in the upper well (1 × 106/
well) with DMEM medium containing 1% BSA and
TGF-β (10 ng/ml), while medium containing 10% FBS
in the lower chamber. After incubating for 24 h at 37°C,

Cytotoxicity assay
For in vitro cytotoxicity assay, 3-(4,
5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5- diphenyltetrazolium bromide
(MTT) was used. Cells (104/ per well) were cultured

cells in the upper chamber were carefully removed with
a cotton swab, and the invaded cells that had traversed
to reserve face of the membrane were fixed with 4%
paraformaldehyde and stained with gentian violet.

groups (5 mice/group): control; TGF-β 40 ng/kg i.v; DSF
20 mg/mouse p.o + TGF-β 40 ng/kg i.v. After one week
of injection, the mice were administrated orally with DSF
for three consecutive days, while the control and TGF-β
groups received PBS. Five days later, the groups (TGF-β
group, TGF-β + DSF group) were administrated with
TGF-β and the control group was still given PBS. Tumor
dimensions were measured with vernier caliper and
tumor volumes were estimated by the formula: length ×
width2 × 0.5. The mice were sacrificed after 30 days, and
the tumors and the organs with visible metastatic tumors
were removed, photographed and subjected to further
analysis.

Mammosphere culture
MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells were cultured in
6-well plates and exposed to drugs as mentioned above.
The cells were collected and furthered cultured in ultralow adherence 24-well plates (Corning, MA, USA) with
1 ml stem cell culture medium (serum-free DMEM-F12
supplemented with B27 (Invitrogen), 20 ng/ml epidermal
growth factor (Peprotech), 10 ng/ml basic fibroblasts
growth factor (Peprotech), 10 μg/ml insulin (Sigma)) at a
density of 10,000 cells/well. After 7–10 days culture, the
mammospheres were photographed.

Immunohistochemistry
Immunohistochemistry was performed on formalinfixed paraffin-embedded tumor tissue sections. The
sections were deparaffinized, rehydrated and stained with
primary antibodies over night at 4°C. These antibodies
were detected with biotinylated secondary antibody,
followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidaseconjugated streptavidin-biotin complex. Finally, the
sections were developed in diaminobenzidine and
visualized under a light microscope

ALDEFLUOR assay
The ALDH-positive population in drug treated
cells was detected by ALDEFLUOR kit (StemCell
Tech., USA) following the manufacturer. The cells
(1 × 106/ml) were assayed on a flow cytometer after
staining in ALDH substrate containing assay buffer for
30 min at 37°C. The negative control was treated with
diethylaminobenzaldehyde (DEAB), a specific ALDH
inhibitor.

Statistical analysis
Data were expressed as mean ± SEM. Each value
is the mean of at least three separate experiments in each
group. Student’s t-test was conducted using GraphPad
Prism software. P < 0.05 was considered significant.

Electrophoretic mobility-shift assay (EMSA)
NF-κB DNA-binding activity was measured by
EMSA by using a LightShift chemiluminescent EMSA
kit (Pierce, USA) as previously described [31]. Briefly,
nuclear extract (5 μg) was incubated with biotin-labeled
oligonucleotide in binding buffer for 20 min at room
temperature. The specificity of the NF-κB DNA-binding
was determined by in competition reactions in which a
200-fold molar excess of unlabeled probe was added to the
binding reaction. Products of binding reactions were then
subjected to gel electrophoresis on a 5.5% polyacrylamide
gel and transferred to a PVDF membrane. The signal was
detected by chemiluminescent photography.
