ABSTRACT
Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) and DNA methyltransferase inhibitors
(DNMTi) are in early clinical development for multiple myeloma (MM) therapy. Despite
all encouraging pre-clinical data, clinical activity of HDACi and DNMTi is mostly lacking.
To optimize the trials, characterization of the in vivo response towards HDACi and
DNMTi will be crucial. Therefore, we investigated the transcriptional response after
in vivo treatment with the HDACi quisinostat or DNMTi decitabine using the murine
5T33MM model.
We identified 504 and 154 genes deregulated by quisinostat and decitabine,
respectively. Of interest, MM patients’ gene expression levels of 62 quisinostat- and
25 decitabine-deregulated genes were predictive for overall survival of patients.
This prognostic information was implemented in a DNA methylation and histone
acetylation score. A high score was related to a high proliferative and immature
phenotype of MM cells. Furthermore, highly scored MM patients had an adverse overall
survival. Interestingly, bio-informatic prediction tools revealed an association of
quisinostat-deregulated genes with lymphocyte activation, proliferation, immuneeffector mechanisms and T-helper-1 development.
Overall, treatment of 5T33MM mice with epigenetic modulating agents led to
the translation of gene signatures to predict overall survival of MM patients. HDACi
mainly deregulated tumoral immunomodulatory pathways, supporting the rationale
to combine HDACi with immunomodulatory therapies.

INTRODUCTION

bone destruction, drug resistance and immune escape
[1]. MM is characterized by a genetic heterogeneity that
is translated to a large range of patients’ survival times
[2]. Prognosis of MM patients can be assessed by the
International Staging System reflecting disease activity
and inflammatory status. The molecular characteristics
of MM cells are determined by chromosomal alterations
and alterations in gene expression [3-11]. Treatments

Multiple myeloma (MM) is a hematological plasma
cell malignancy. Malignant plasma cells mainly reside
in the bone marrow (BM) where numerous interactions
between MM cells and the BM compartments confer
survival and growth of MM cells and induce angiogenesis,

consist of combinations of various drug classes such
as glucocorticoids, proteasome inhibitors, alkylators
and immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs) with or without
high dose melphalan (HDM) and autologous stem cell
transplantation (ASCT) [12]. Although the combination of
these drugs have significantly improved patient survival
[13-15], a majority of patients still relapses, emphasizing
the need to find alternative treatment options.
Epigenetic aberrations have been reported
to contribute to MM pathogenesis, together with
genetic abnormalities [16-18]. DNA methylation and
posttranslational histone modification are two major
epigenetic modifications. DNA methylation is considered
a prognostic marker in human MM [19-23] and differences
can be detected between MGUS and MM in terms of
gene-specific methylation and global hypomethylation
of non-CpG islands (repetitive elements or intergenic
regions) [22, 24]. Moreover, cytogenetic MM subgroups
are defined by differences in DNA methylation patterns
[22, 25]. Among posttranslational histone modifications,
methylation and acetylation are extensively studied in
relation to cancer [26]. The t(4;14) translocation in MM
cells, present in approximately 15% of the patients, leads
to overexpression of WHSC1 encoding for the histone
methyltransferase MMSET [27]. In addition, mutations
in the histone methyltransferases WHSC1L1, MLL1-3
and in the histone demethylase UTX are identified in MM
patients [28, 29].
Epigenetic
modulating
agents
such
as
histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) and DNA
methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTi) interfere with
epigenetic aberrations in cancer [30]. HDACi used alone
or in combination with conventional anti-MM agents have
potent pre-clinical anti-MM effects [31-33]. The same
holds true for the DNMTi azacytidine or decitabine [34,
35]. Furthermore, using HDACi and DNMTi, we recently
identified gene expression-based risk scores, which are
predictive for the sensitivity of MM cells towards DNMTi
and HDACi as well as for the overall survival of MM
patients. This pre-clinical work provides the rationale for
clinical trials evaluating the anti-MM activity of HDACi.
While single-agents HDACi appeared to mediate little to
no clinical activity [36-38], combinatory treatment of the
pan-HDACi vorinostat or panobinostat in combination
with respectively the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib or
bortezomib plus dexamethasone did prolong progression
free survival with respectively 0.8 months and 3.9 months
[39, 40]. However, the clinical relevance in terms of
overall survival is not yet clear and a high occurrence of
side effects was observed [39, 40]. In addition, a phase II
trial of the combination of panobinostat with melphalan,
thalidomide and prednisone was also associated with a
high occurrence of side effects [41]. As for the DNMTi,
the therapeutic potential in MM is yet to be evaluated in
clinical trials.
These above mentioned clinical trials raise questions
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

about the efficacy of epigenetic modulating agents in MM
patients. Although the pre-clinical studies on epigenetic
modulating agents demonstrated pleiotropic mechanisms
of action explaining their anti-MM activity [34, 42-44],
it is widely known that the drug response of MM cells is
influenced by interactions with the BM microenvironment
and immune system [45-47]. Thus, a better understanding
of the in vivo mechanisms of epigenetic modulating
agents will be crucial as it can provide new possibilities
for combinatory therapies, identify more specific targets,
reduce side effects and identify the patients whom might
benefit from treatment with epigenetic modulating agents
[48]. We have previously demonstrated potent in vivo antiMM activity for decitabine and the HDACi quisinostat
using the immune competent, syngeneic 5TMM models
[31, 32, 34]. These models are suitable for studies on
MM biology and pre-clinical drug testing because they
take into account the BM microenvironment and immune
system [32, 49-52]. Here, we investigated the in vivo
transcriptional response of MM cells towards decitabine
and quisinostat in the 5T33MM model to validate our
previous work on the prognostic relevance and to identify
new in vivo relevant targets.

RESULTS
In vivo treatment with epigenetic modulating
agents induced transcriptional changes linked
with survival of MM patients
The syngeneic immunocompetent 5T33MM
model was used to study the in vivo transcriptional
response towards the DNMTi decitabine and the HDACi
quisinostat. Quisinostat is a hydroxamate-based panHDAC inhibitor with similar HDAC selectivity as
panobinostat [53]. In a preliminary series of experiments,
the sub-lethal concentrations showing minimal effects
on BM plasmacytosis ensuring the yield of good quality
RNA were determined (data not shown). Next, mice with
established disease were treated with these sub-lethal
concentrations of decitabine or quisinostat for 5 days
(Supplementary Figure S1A). Total BM plasmacytosis
was above 80% in the vehicle and decitabine-treated mice,
while quisinostat decreased tumor load to approximately
60% (Supplementary Figure S1B). Overall, the shortterm treatment had only minimal anti-MM effects thus
warranting good sample quality.
Using Significance Analysis of Microarray
(SAM), decitabine treatment resulted in a significant
upregulation of 172 probe sets and downregulation
of 8 ones (false discovery rate (FDR) ≤ 5%; ratio ≥ 2),
corresponding to 154 unique genes. Quisinostat treatment
induced a significant upregulation of 569 probe sets and
downregulation of 5 probe sets (FDR ≤ 5%; ratio ≥ 2),

corresponding to 504 unique genes. Ninety-eight genes
were commonly deregulated by decitabine and quisinostat
(Figure 1, Supplementary Tables S1-S2). The prognostic
value of the human orthologs for the overall survival
of patients with MM of murine deregulated genes was
investigated using patients data from the University

Clinics of Heidelberg and Montpellier (HM)-cohort
as a training cohort and the University of Arkansas for
Medical Sciences-Total Therapy 2 (TT2-cohort) as
validation cohort [54-57]. Using the HM-cohort, five
decitabine-deregulated probe sets had a prognostic value
for a better overall survival and 20 for an adverse one

(Table 1). Thirty-one quisinostat-deregulated genes had a
favourable prognostic value and 30 an adverse one (Table
1). The prognostic information of the 25 decitabine- or
61 quisinostat-deregulated genes was implemented
into respectively a murine DNA methylation (Mu-DM)
score or a murine histone acetylation (Mu-HA) score,
as described in Material and Methods. Subsequently,
we analyzed the scores during MM progression [58].
MM cells had a higher Mu-HA score (p<0.05) compared
to purified healthy plasma cells (BMPCs). HMCLs
had significant higher scores (p<0.0001) compared to
MM cells and BMPCs (Figure 1). Both scores could
predict patients’ overall survival. In the training cohort,
a maximum difference in overall survival (OS) was
identified with a Mu-DM score of -6.06 (Figure 2A).
Patients with Mu-DM score ≤ -6.06 had a significant
lower risk (80% of the patients who did not reach median
OS) compared to patients with a Mu-DM score > -6.06
(20% of the patients with a median OS of 25 months).
For the Mu-HA score, a maximal difference in OS was
observed with -20.13 as cut-off, splitting patients in a lowrisk group (Mu-HA score ≤ -20.13; 77.7% of the patients
who did not reach median OS) and a high-risk group (MuHA score > -20.13; 22.3% of the patients with a median
survival of 24 months) (Figure 2A). This prognostic value
of the score was validated in an independent validation
cohort (TT2-cohort) as shown in Figure 2B. We then

evaluated whether the scores could have a prognostic
value in relapsed patients. Using the Mulligan-cohort,
including patients treated with bortezomib after relapse,
only the Mu-HA score kept prognostic value (Figure 2C).
Next, we evaluated whether the scores could be used to
predict response to therapy. Using the HM-cohort, we
could not find a significant difference in the distributions
of low scored and high scored patients between different
response groups following high-dose therapy and
autologous stem cell transplantation (data not shown).
For the Mulligan-cohort we only tested the Mu-HA score.
The distributions of low scored and high scored patients
were significantly different between non-responders (no
change + progressive disease) compared to responders
(complete response + partial response + minimal response)
(Supplementary Table S3). The prediction had a high
specificity (97.3%), but a low sensitivity (16.1%).
Next, the prognostic value for overall survival
of Mu-DM and Mu-HA scores was compared with
conventional prognostic factors including beta-2microglobulin (B2m), International Staging (ISS), t(4;14)
and del17p. We also included other gene expression-based
risk scores such as High Risk Score (HRS corresponding
to UAMS-70-gene model) [8], Intergroupe Francophone
du Myélome (IFM) score [4], Risk Score (RS) [7], DNA
methylation (DM) score [35], histone acetylation (HA)
score [59] and gene expression-based proliferation

the prognostic value of Mu-DM (top) and Mu-HA (bottom) score was calculated by the optimal separation of patients of the HM-cohort

the Mu-DM (top) and Mu-HA (bottom) score were tested in the independent TT2-cohort (n=345) using the same cut-off value as obtained

index (GPI) [5]. Univariate Cox analysis showed that
all these factors have prognostic value (Supplementary
table S4) [5, 35, 59]. When analyzed 2 by 2, Mu-DM
remained significant with del17p and Mu-HA score in
the HM training cohort. The Mu-HA score remained
significant with t(4;14) and Mu-DM in bivariate analyses.
Multivariate Cox analysis with all parameters tested
together showed that Mu-DM, Mu-HA and t(4;14)
remained independent prognostic factors in the HM
training cohort. In the TT2 validation cohort, Cox bivariate
analysis showed significance of Mu-DM and Mu-HA score
together with all factors including the previously reported
DM and HA scores but not with HRS and IFM scores

(Supplementary table S4). HRS and t(4;14) remained
independent prognostic factors when all parameters were
tested together in the TT2 validation cohort. When tested
with the previously reported DM and HA score, the MuDM and Mu-HA score remained independent in the HM
validation cohort but not in the TT2 training cohort in the
multivariate analysis (Supplementary Table S4).
To investigate the characteristics of the stratified
patients, the distribution of the Mu-DM and the Mu-HA
score among the 8 molecular subgroups of MM using
the TT2-cohort was analyzed [60]. Both scores were
significantly higher (p<0.05) in the proliferation subgroup
(PR) compared to all other subgroups (Figure 3A). The PR

subgroup was the only group with a median score above
the cut-point and has been associated with a poor prognosis
[60]. In addition, a significant correlation between GPI
groups from HM-cohort and Mu-DM or Mu-HA score
was identified (r = 0.36; p<.01; n=206 and r = 0.32; p<
.01; n=206 respectively) in MM cells of patients. This is
further confirmed by the significant gradual increase in
the Mu-DM and Mu-HA scores from GPIlow to GPImedium
and GPIhigh groups (p<0.05) (Figure 3B) [5]. Recently,
the presence of a hierarchical plasma cell progenitor
organization was described in the BM of MM patients
and it was furthermore suggested that an epigeneticmediated plasticity exists between these plasma cell
progenitors [61]. Therefore, we analyzed the scores in the
in vitro generated transitional stages from memory B-cell
to plasma cells [58, 62]. We found that both scores were
significantly higher (p<0.05) in pre-plasmablast (Pre-PB)
stages and significantly lower (p<0.05) in healthy donor
BMPCs compared to all other conditions. The other stages
were considered as having an intermediate Mu-DM and
Mu-HA score with plasmablasts (PBs), plasma cells (PCs)
and long-lived plasma cells (LL-PCs) having a higher Mu-

DM score compared to memory B-cells (MBCs) (Figure
3C). In summary, quisinostat and decitabine altered in vivo
the expression of a gene signature that is associated with
prognosis allowing risk stratification of patients. High
scores are furthermore linked with a proliferative and
immature plasma cell phenotype.

In vivo quisinostat or decitabine treatment altered
the expression of genes involved in immune
pathways
Using DAVID gene ontology (GO) software,
the enrichment of the in vivo deregulated genes with a
biological process was investigated [63, 64]. GO analysis

immune regulation, metabolism/homeostasis, development

of gene expression and cell death (Supplementary Table

cytokine receptors (IL7R, IL18R1, KIT, FLT3, CSF1R,
CSF3R, MET, TNFRSF12). Genes encoding for proteins
involved in lymphocyte activation include co-inhibitory
proteins (CTLA4, CTLA2A, CTLA2B), co-stimulatory
proteins (PTPRC), antigen-presenting protein (H2DMA), lymphocyte activation marker (CD69), monocyte
marker (CD14), transcription factors (RUNX1, PBX1,
SMAD1, HOXA9, NFKBIZ, JUN, KLF6) and NK-cell
inhibitory receptors (KLRD1, KLRA7). Genes encoding
for proteins associated with immune-effector responses
include phagocytose receptors (FCGR3, FCGR2B),
phagocytosis mediators (PRKCA, PRKCD), extracellular
matrix (ECM) component FN1 and its receptor ITGA5
and more downstream regulators (PAK1, RHOA, VAV3,
IQGAP2, ENAH, APCRB, TMSB4X, DIAP1) involved in
actin polymerization, adherens junctions and stress fibers
polymerization (Figure 4, Supplementary Table S5, S6,
S7). Thus, in vivo treatment with quisinostat induced a
broad transcriptional response within the tumor cells with
a significant deregulation of genes encoding for proteins
involved in immune regulation pathways.

these genes were dispersed across all the different enriched
GO sets. STRING protein network analysis confirmed
the GO analysis and showed network interactions
linked with immune cell regulation, cell death pathways
and metabolism (Supplementary Figure S2, S3) [65].
Reactome pathway analysis revealed that after quisinostat
treatment, there were several enriched gene sets and these
were associated with growth factor signaling including
tumor necrosis factor (TNF), TNF-related apoptosisinducing ligand (TRAIL), interferon-gamma (IFN-γ),
interleukin-1 (IL-1), IL-2, IL-12, bone morphogenetic
protein (BMP) and transforming growth factor beta
(TGF-β). In addition, several signaling pathways showed
enrichment of deregulated genes and include p38/MAPK,
PI3K/Akt, SMAD, eIF4e, proteoglycan and integrin
signaling (Supplementary Table S6).
Of particular interest, GO analysis, Reactome and
STRING commonly identified a significant enrichment
of genes linked with immune pathways. This immune
pathway gene signature was characterized by genes
encoding for proteins involved in lymphocyte activation
and proliferation, immune-effector processes and
T-helper-1 development as depicted by Reactome.
Using Pathway-Guide, we found that the gene signature
is built up by genes involved in chemokine signaling,
cytokine interactions, phagocytosis, T-cell receptor
and natural-killer (NK) cell signaling (Supplementary
Table S7). The signature includes genes coding for
chemokines (CXCL12, PBPB, CCL9, CCL3), chemokine
receptors (CCR5, CCR2), cytokines (IFNG, OSM) and

DISCUSSION
To gain insight into the in vivo transcriptional
response towards epigenetic modulating agents, we treated
the syngeneic immunocompetent murine 5T33MM model
with sub-lethal doses of the DNMTi decitabine and the
HDACi quisinostat. First, in vivo treatment identified
several deregulated genes with a prognostic value in the

HM-cohort allowing the development of gene expressionbased risk scores. In accordance with our previous work in
HMCL, both the Mu-DM and Mu-HA score were found to
have a prognostic value for OS in two tested independent
MM cohorts [35, 59]. In line, both the Mu-DM and MuHA score were an independent variable for prognosis of
OS together with t(4;14) in the HM-cohort but not in the
TT2-cohort after multivariate COX analysis. In addition,
the Mu-HA and Mu-DM score were independent of the
previous published HA- and DM score in the HM cohort
[35, 59]. In addition, we showed that the Mu-HA score
is predictive for overall survival of relapsed patients
treated with bortezomib and further confirmed that
gene expression profiling is useful for the prediction of
outcome of newly diagnosed and relapsed patients [66].
The predictive power of the scores for treatment response
was limited as the Mu-HA score had a low specificity
of prediction for response to bortezomib and we did not
identify a significant association between the Mu-DM
or Mu-HA score and response to highdose conditioning
chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation.
This confirms recently published data that gene expression
profiling alone is not sufficient for predicting treatment
response [67, 68]. Overall, these data show the translation
of gene signatures obtained after in vivo treatment of
mice with epigenetic modulating agents that can be used
to predict overall survival of previously untreated and
relapsed MM patients. This furthermore validates the
use of the 5T33MM model for evaluating the response
towards epigenetic modulating agents and provides the
framework for testing other epigenetic modulating agents
with other or more specific targets.
Subsequently, we studied which factor(s) are
responsible for the separation of MM patients. The
observation that patients from the “PR” MM subgroup
linked with a bad prognosis have higher Mu-DM and/or
Mu-HA scores compared to all other subgroups indicates
an association of high risk with proliferation and is in
line with the results of the in vitro obtained DM- and
HA-score [35, 59, 69]. The gradual higher score values
in the GPIhigh and GPImedium group compared to the GPIlow
group furthermore confirm the link between a high score
and high proliferation [5]. We also compared transitional
populations from memory B-cells to plasma cells for
their score values. Pre-plasmablasts and plasmablasts
are characterized by a higher proliferation rate compared
to memory B-cells, early plasma cells and BMPCs [62,
70]. In addition, HMLCs were developed from primary
MM samples which escaped the BM dependency and are
highly proliferative [58, 71]. Our observation that preplasmablasts and HMCL displayed the highest Mu-DM
and Mu-HA scores again indicates a link between a high
score and proliferation. Overall, this validates our earlier
work with the DM-score and HA-score [35, 59, 69] and
suggests an association between the expression levels of
epigenetically regulated genes and a high risk linked with
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

a high proliferative and immature plasma cell phenotype.
Recently, the existence of plasma cell progenitors
that recapitulate the different maturation stages of plasma
cell differentiation was described within the BM of MM
patients [62, 70] and was associated with proteasome
inhibitor resistance [61, 72]. MM progenitors including B
cells and pre-plasmablasts were found to survive treatment
with proteasome inhibitors and were significantly enriched
in MM patients refractory to bortezomib treatment. These
Xbp1s negative pre-plasmablastic cells are characterized
by a diminished endoplasmic reticulum stress and thus
resistance to proteasome inhibitors since they are not
committed to high Ig production [72, 73]. Furthermore,
plasmablastic progenitors have been described to
overexpress epigenetic regulators, compared to mature
plasma cells, suggesting that transitions in plasma cell
differentiation stages could be linked to epigenetic
plasticity [61]. Thus, HDACi or DNMTi combined
treatment could influence the plasticity of plasma cell
progenitors and potentially target tumor progenitors
that contribute to treatment failure in MM. Moreover,
the scores presented here may be useful to predict the
presence of such immature plasma cell populations.
In line with previous in vitro gene-expression
profiling studies, we found associations of in vivo
HDACi- and DNMTi-deregulated genes with biogenesis,
cytoskeletal organization and immunological pathways
[20, 35, 59]. In particular, we provide evidence that
quisinostat (and to a lesser extend decitabine) induces
tumoral transcriptional changes of genes involved
in immune response pathways, namely lymphocyte
activation and proliferation, immune-effector processes
and T-helper-1 development. The immune system is
suppressed in MM and studies focusing on reversing
the suppressive state to boost immune-mediated antitumor responses are ongoing [74]. Emerging evidence
indicates that epigenetics plays an important role
in various aspects of the immune system including
cytokine production, dendritic cell activation, plasticity
of CD4+ T cells, regulatory T cell function and plasma
cell differentiation [75, 76]. In line, recent pre-clinical
work has demonstrated that epigenetic modulating
agents have immunomodulatory effects. West et al.
suggested that HDACi require an intact immune system
for long term effects in murine cancer models [43].
The authors demonstrated that the HDACi vorinostat
mediated immunogenic anti-tumor effects through IFN-γ
production by B-cells [77]. These effects were moreover
enhanced by α-galactosylceramide and may imply a
role for NKT cells [77, 78]. Vorinostat was also shown
to possess immunomodulatory properties in isolated
peripheral blood mononuclear cells and in mice after
lipopolysaccharide exposure [79]. Interestingly, in AML
patients, panobinostat in combination with azacytidine
decreased TNFR2+ regulatory T-cell populations
associated with IFN-γ and IL-2 induction [80]. Taken

together, our data and work by others supports the use of
HDACi in combination with immunomodulatory therapies
such as IMiDs,transplantation, humoral or cellular/peptide
vaccines as recently suggested [77, 81].
So far, a few pre-clinical studies demonstrated
combinatory effects of HDACi and IMiDs in MM but lack
mechanistic evidence. Vorinostat in combination with the
thalidomide derivate IMiD1 showed combinatory effects
in vitro [82]. In addition, panobinostat enhanced anti-MM
effects of lenalidomide and dexamethasone in vitro and in
vivo [83]. Vorinostat or panobinostat have been shown to
present synergistic effects in combination with the immune
cell stimulating antibodies anti-CD40 and anti-CD137 in
immunocompetent models of mammary, renal and colon
carcinoma [84]. Very recently, in a murine melanoma
model, panobinostat was demonstrated to synergize with
an adoptive T-cell transfer leading to systemic immune
responses to reduce melanoma tumor burden [81].
Panobinostat influenced T-cell populations and systemic
cytokine production independent from the presence
of tumor [81]. The above work suggests the potential
of combining HDACi with immunotherapy strategies.
Nevertheless, future pre-clinical in vivo work is mandatory
to further address this possibility. Regarding safety issues,
it was only recently shown that the combination of
vorinostat and lenalidomide plus dexamethasone is well
tolerated in MM patients in a phase I clinical trial [85].
In conclusion, in vivo treatment of MM cells with
epigenetic modulating agents results in a transcriptional
response that can be linked to prognosis. This prognostic
signature was used to construct a gene expression based
risk score allowing risk stratification of newly diagnosed
patients. In addition, HDACi treatment (and to a lesser
extent DNMTi) resulted in a wide transcriptional response
involving overlapping gene signatures mainly mediating
immune response. This indicates that transcriptional
immune regulation is an important in vivo biological
response of tumor cells towards HDACi and supports
the rationale for the combination of HDACi and
immunomodulatory therapies.

housed according to the conditions approved by the
Ethical Committee for Animal Experiments of the Vrije
Universiteit Brussel (license no. LA1230281). The
5T33MM model was maintained as previously described
[86]. At day 0, naive C57BL/KaLwRij mice were injected
with 5x105 5T33MM cells. At established disease (day
16), mice were treated with decitabine (0.2mg/kg)
(intraperitoneal injection, daily) or quisinostat (1.5mg/
kg) (subcutaneous injection, once every other day). After
5 days, mice were sacrified. Bone marrow was isolated
from hind legs and subjected to red blood cell lysis. For
mRNA analysis, tumor cells were purified by depletion of
CD11b+ contaminating cells. An overall mean purity of
plasma cells of above 90% was obtained (Supplementary
Figure S1C). Cytospins were made before and after
depletion to count the percentage of plasma cells as
described previously [32].

Gene expression profiling
Samples with more than 95% plasma cells (N=4
in each group) were used for RNA isolation using the
RNeasy Kit (Qiagen, Venlo, The Netherlands). RNA was
further processed and hybridized to the Mouse Genome
430 2.0 Array (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA) as
described in Moreaux et. al [35]. Microarray data are
available at ArrayExpress database (Accession number:
E-MTAB-3178).

Microarray data of primary multiple myeloma
cells and human myeloma cell lines
Affymetrix data of two independent cohorts of
previously untreated MM patients was used. The training
cohort consists of 206 MM patients and is termed the
Heidelberg-Montpellier (HM)-cohort. This cohort also
includes 7 bone marrow plasma cell (BMPC) samples
from healthy donors. The samples were obtained
after written informed consent in accordance with the
Declaration of Helsinki and after approval of the ethics
committee of Montpellier and Heidelberg. These data
are publically available through ArrayExpress database
(E-MTAB-372). The validation cohort contains 345
MM patients from the University of Arkansas for
Medical Sciences (UAMS, Little Rock, AR, USA) and
is termed the TT2-cohort. These data can be accessed
at the online Gene Expression Omnibus (GSE2658). In
the HM study, patients underwent front line high-dose
conditioning chemotherapy with 200mg/m² melphalan
and autologous stem cell transplantation [5, 56]. In the
UAMS study, patients received thalidomide or placebo
in combination with 4 consecutive induction cycles
containing (i) vincristine + doxorubicin + dexamethasone,
(ii) cyclophosphamide + etoposide + cisplatin +
dexamethasone, (iii) cyclophosphamide + doxorubicin,

This was followed by high-dose melphalan and autologous
stem cell transplantation [54, 87, 88]. The presence of
cytogenetic abnormalities was evaluated by iFISH in
the patients of the HM cohort. For TT2, the presence of
t(4;14) was predicted by MMSET spike expression [89].
We also used Affymetrix data of 152 relapsed MM patients
subsequently treated with bortezomib (GSE9782) from the
study by Mulligan et al. [57]. The clinical characteristics
of the cohorts have been described previously and are
summarized in Supplementary Table S8 [54-57]. In
addition, we used the Affymetrix data of 40 human
myeloma cell lines (HMCLs) stored in the ArrayExpress
database (E-TABM-937 and E-TABM-1088) [58]. The
derivation of the HMCLs as well as their phenotypic and
molecular characteristics were previously published [58].

genes with prognostic value in the training cohort,
weighted by + or – 1 if the patients’ MM cell MAS5 signal
for any given gene is above or below the probe set Maxstat
