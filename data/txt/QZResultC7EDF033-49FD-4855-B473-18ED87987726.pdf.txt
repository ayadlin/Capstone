ABSTRACT
Atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor (ATRT) is a malignant pediatric brain tumor with
great recurrence after complete surgery and chemotherapy. Here, we demonstrate
that cisplatin treatment selects not only for resistance but also for a more oncogenic
phenotype characterized by high self-renewal and invasive capabilities. These
phenomena are likely due to STAT3 upregulatoin which occurred simultaneously with
higher expression of Snail, an activator of epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT),
in ATRT-CisR cells. STAT3 knockdown effectively suppressed Snail expression and
blocked motility and invasion in ATRT-CisR cells, while overexpressing Snail reversed
these effects. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay indicated that STAT3 directly
bound to Snail promoter. Moreover, STAT3 knockdown effectively suppressed cancer
stem-like properties, synergistically enhanced the chemotherapeutic effect, and
significantly improved survival rate in ATRT-CisR-transplanted immunocompromised
mice. Finally, immunohistochemistrical analysis showed that STAT3 and Snail were
coexpressed at high levels in recurrent ATRT tissues. Thus, the STAT3/Snail pathway
plays an important role in oncogenic resistance, rendering cells not only drugresistant but also increasingly oncogenic (invasion, EMT and recurrence). Therefore,
the STAT3/Snail could be a target for ATRT treatment.

Patients with ATRT have a poor prognosis and a short
survival that ranges from approximately 16 to 24 months
[2, 3]. ATRT contains a unique heterogeneous combination
of cells, including rhabdoid cells and peripheral epithelial
and mesenchymal elements. Due to the histological

similarity on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of ATRT
and medulloblastoma, ATRT is easily misclassified as a
primitive neuroectodermal tumor/medulloblastoma [1, 4].
Radiation is not a treatment option for ATRT patients because
neuroradiation causes significant neurocognitive deficiency in
children or infants with ATRT [5]. The standard therapeutic
treatment for ATRT patients involves surgical resection
and chemotherapy, which slightly improves the relatively
low disease-free survival outcome [2, 3]. Although brain
tumors rarely metastasize to distant organs, ATRT displays
aggressive behavior that promotes tumor dissemination,
including intracranial and spinal cord invasion [6].
Cisplatin (cis-diamminedichloroplatinum; CDDP)based chemotherapy regimens are the standard treatment
for ATRT patients who have received surgical resection [7].
However, during the course of chemotherapy, resistance
to chemotherapeutic drugs often develops and causes the
tumor to recur. High recurrence rates and drug-resistance
potential have been reported in ATRT even after completion
of combined therapy [8, 9]. It has been reported that
chemotherapy can increase oncogenic phenotype, such as
invasiveness and cancer stem cell (CSC)-derived self-renewal
capabilities [10]. Moreover, oncogenic resistance, associated
with activation of pathways of cell proliferation and
suppression of apoptosis, confers resistance to the growthinhibitory carcinogenic environment, eventually causes to the
aggressive manners of cancer malignancy [11]. For example,
Bcr-Abl, a fusion of Bcr-Abl that results in the constitutively
active kinase Bcr–Abl, renders cells resistant to apoptosis
caused by DNA damaging drugs and simultaneously renders
a cell leukemogenic [12]. Furthermore, c­hemotherapyinduced tumor progression, a type of selection for oncogenic
resistance, renders cells resistant to chemotherapy and
simultaneously promotes its oncogenic potential [11].
However, the interplay between cisplatin-selected resistance
and ATRT recurrence is still unclear.
The epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in
cancer induces a triad of cancer features: invasion and
metastasis; stem cell properties; and drug resistance [13].
In hepatomas, activation of EMT and hedgehog signaling
are associated with chemoresistance and invasion [14].
Certain EMT transcription factors, such as Snail and
Slug, have been reported to induce radioresistance and
chemoresistance by antagonizing p53-mediated apoptosis
[15] and directly contribute to cisplatin resistance in
ovarian cancer [16]. ZEB1, another regulator of EMT,
has been shown to influence invasion, chemoresistance
and tumorigenesis, and orchestrate key features of a CSClike phenotype in malignant gliomas [13]. Vice versa,
drug resistance in cancer cells has been implicated in
the positive regulation of EMT. It has been reported that
cisplatin-resistant lung cancer cells acquire an EMT-like
phenotype and CSC-like properties through the AKT/
β-catenin/Snail signaling pathway [17]. Furthermore, cisplatin
treatment of primary and metastatic epithelial ovarian
carcinomas generates residual cells with a mesenchymal stem

cell-like profile [18]. Recently, Sun and colleagues showed
evidence that chemotherapy-induced EMT in human tongue
cancer cells occurs through Bmi-1 targeting by miR-200b and
miR-15b [19]. Cisplatin also induces resistance to moleculartargeted agents through an activated EMT pathway [20].
However, the function of EMT and aoosiated processes in
CNS cancer has received little attention so far. It is believed
that critical invasion pathways/EMT-like properties overlap
between CNS and other cancers [13, 21]. Nevertheless, the
interplay between EMT-like pathways and chemoresistance
in ATRT has not yet been clarified.
Signal-transducer-and-activator-of-transcription 3
(STAT3), a transcription factor involved in cytokine
signaling, participates in the regulation of cell cycle,
apoptosis, cell invasion, and angiogenesis [22]. Recent
studies have shown that STAT3 activation in brain
tumors, such as gliomas and medulloblastomas, is a
prognostic indicator for malignant progression, tumor
growth, and a low patient survival rate [23]. STAT3 is
also involved in regulating the EMT process in several
cancer types [24, 25]. STAT3 activation is required for
TGF-β-induced EMT in lung cancer cells [26]. Through
cooperation with EGFR, STAT3 upregulates Twist and
subsequently induces EMT [27]. Moreover, the JAK/
STAT3/Snail signaling pathway activates head and
neck tumor metastasis and EMT [28]. Additionally,
an IL-6/STAT3/miR34a feedback loop has been
shown to promote EMT-mediated cancer invasion
and metastasis in human colorectal cancer cells [29].
The role of STAT3 in regulating chemoresistance
has recently been emphasized in cancer cells such as
glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and neuroblastoma.
Activation of the IL6/STAT3 pathway protects GBM
and neuroblastoma cells from drug-induced apoptosis
[30, 31]. In breast cancer cells, an autocrine signaling
between STAT3 and RANTES is essential for tamoxifen
resistance [32]. Targeting of the STAT3 protein was
shown to effectively kill GBM cells and suppress GBM
tumor growth [33]. However, it remains unknown
whether STAT3 signaling is involved in the acquisition
of chemosensitivity and in enhancing EMT-related
properties with tumor invasion in ATRT.
In our study, we found that cisplatin-selected resistant
ATRT (CisR; ATRT-CisR) cells displayed higher STAT3
expression and it plays a role in oncogenic phenotype,
such as cell motility, tumor invasion, and chemoresistance.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay in ATRTCisR cells confirmed that STAT3 directly bound to the
promoter of Snail, which is known to induce EMT. We
showed that STAT3/Snail signaling played an important
role in oncogenic resistance, rendering cells not only
to be drug-resistant but also oncogenic (invasion, EMT
and recurrence). That result suggested that this signaling
pathway is a novel treatment target for ATRT patients. Our
findings indicate interplay between chemoresistance and
tumor invasion/EMT-like properties in ATRT.

cisplatin IC50 values in Pt1 and Pt2 cells were determined
to be approximately 3 μg/ml and 1 μg/ml, respectively.
These concentrations of cisplatin were then used to treat
Pt1 and Pt2 cells for 3 months to establish corresponding
age- and passage-matched cisplatin-selected resistant cell
lines (Pt1-CisR and Pt2-CisR).
Previous studies have shown that CisR cancer cell
lines have a characteristic fibroblastic morphology and
reduced intercellular contacts [16]. We also found that
the Pt1-CisR and Pt2-CisR cells displayed a spindle-like
morphology and formed a non-cohesive sheet compared
with the round lymphoid-like parental cells (Pt1-Par and
Pt2-Par; Figure 1A, right). To determine the difference in
cisplatin IC50 values between the established parental and
resistant ATRT cells, a cisplatin dose-response curve for
treatments ranging from 1 to 10 μg/ml was determined
for the cells. The cell survival curve showed significantly
different IC50 values between parental and resistant ATRT
cells (Figure 1B; Pt1-Par, 3 μg/ml; Pt2-Par, 1 μg/ml versus
Pt1-Cis, 9 μg/ml; Pt2-CisR, 8 μg/ml). Furthermore, ATRTCisR cells showed an enhanced ability for anchorageindependent growth on agarose (Figure 1C) as well as
increased migration (Supplementary Figure 1A) and
invasion (Figure 1D) compared with their parental cells.
To further investigate potential downstream
pathways of cisplatin-induced cell motility, we compared
the gene expression levels of cell motility-associated
factors using RT2 Profiler PCR arrays in the two pairs of
parental and resistant cells. We focused on cell motility
–related genes and selected those genes that were more
strongly expressed (>1.5 fold) in ATRT-CisR than
ATRT-Par cells. The results revealed that BCAR1, Rac1,
Rho, and STAT3 were increased expression in ATRTCisR cells compared with ATRT-Par cells (Figure 1E,
left). The mRNA and protein levels of these molecules
were confirmed by qPCR and Western blot analysis,
respectively. STAT3 displayed the most significant
difference between ATRT-Par and ATRT-CisR cells
(Figure 1E, right; Supplementary Figure 1B–Figure 1C).
Immunofluorescent staining also confirmed higher STAT3
expression in ATRT-CisR cells than in ATRT-Par cells
(Figure 1F). To analyze the invasive characteristics of
ATRT-Par and ATRT-CisR cells, the two cell lines were
injected into SCID mice. Examination of paraffin sections
of xenograft tumors from dissected brains showed that
ATRT-Par tumors had low invasive characteristics,
including a clear tumor boundary, large tumor islands,
and a stellate appearance. In contrast, ATRT-CisR tumors
showed significant invasive morphology including small
islands with single-cell invasion (Figure 1G). Importantly,
specimens from ATRT-CisR tumors had higher expression
levels of STAT3 than those from ATRT-Par tumors, as
shown by immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining (Figure 1H,
left) and qPCR analysis (Figure 1H, right). These data
support our observation that cisplatin resistance increases
tumorigenicity and that STAT3 expression is associated
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

with cell motility and invasiveness in cisplatin-selected
resistant ATRT cells.

STAT3 promotes tumor invasion through
induction of EMT factors
The correlation between STAT3 expression level and
ATRT invasiveness prompted us to investigate whether
STAT3 regulates the invasive properties of ATRT-CisR
cells. We knocked down STAT3 expression in the two
ATRT-CisR cell lines using short hairpin RNA (shRNA)
constructs (Figure 2A). STAT3-knockdown cells were
subjected to transwell migration and invasion assays,
which revealed that STAT3 knockdown dramatically
suppressed cell motility and invasiveness in ATRT-CisR
cells (Figure 2B and Supplementary Figure 2A). Previous
studies suggested that EMT might promote tumor invasion,
increase chemoresistance and activate cancer stem-like
capacities [13]. Here, we found that STAT3-overexpressed
ATRT-Par cells (Par/STAT3) and scrambled shRNA controltransfected ATRT-CisR cells (CisR/sh-Scr) had a higher level
of N-cadherin and a lower level of E-cadherin. Conversely,
empty vector-transfected ATRT-Par (Par/Ctrl) and STAT3knockdown ATRT-CisR (CisR/sh-STAT3) cells had lower
N-cadherin levels and higher E-cadherin levels as assessed
by both immunofluorescence staining and Western blot
(Figure 2C and Supplementary Figure 2B). Interestingly, when
the cells were cultured on top of thick collagen (to establish
2.5D culture conditions), Par/STAT3 and CisR/sh-Scr cells
exhibited an elongated morphology, while Par/Ctrl and CisR/
sh-STAT3 cells had rounded shapes (Figure 2D). This finding
implied that in ATRT-CisR cells, STAT3 may modulate cell
morphology and mesenchymal movement in 2.5D. Moreover,
in the 2.5D-cultivated system, Par/STAT3 and CisR/sh-Scr
cells exhibited pseudopod protrusions, whereas Par/Ctrl
and CisR/sh-STAT3 exhibited cortical actin arrangement
(Figure 2E). Taken together, our data support a role for
STAT3 in activating tumor invasion and enhancing the EMTlike phenotype in cisplatin-selected resistant ATRT cells.
The association between STAT3 expression levels,
cell motility, and an EMT-like phenotype in ATRT cells
suggested that STAT3 may regulate ATRT invasive
properties through an EMT mechanism. To investigate the
potential downstream targets of STAT3-mediated tumor
invasion, we performed RT2 Profiler PCR arrays for gene
expression levels of EMT associated factors with three
pairs of cells: ATRT-Par vs. ATRT-CisR; Par/Ctrl vs. Par/
STAT3; and CisR/sh-Scr vs. CisR/sh-STAT3. We focused
on EMT-related genes and selected those genes that were
more strongly expressed (>1.5 fold) in ATRT-CisR, Par/
STAT3, and CisR/sh-Scr cells than in their counterparts
(Figure 2F). The PCR arrays results were confirmed by
qPCR and Western blot in ATRT-Par and ATRT-CisR cells
and revealed that Snail displayed the most significant
difference between ATRT-Par and ATRT-CisR cells
(Figure 2G, Figure 2H; Supplementary Figure 2C).

The STAT3/Snail axis is critical for EMT-like
phenotype and tumor invasion in
cisplatin-selected resistant ATRT cells

To further characterize the Snail promoter sequence
dependencies of STAT3 to the activations of Snail promoter,
we performed a ChIP analysis for a complementary
assessment of promoter activity. ATRT-Par cells were cotransfected with empty vector or ectopic STAT3 expression
vector combined with firefly luciferase reporting vectors with
various Snail promoter regions. Specific STAT3-binding
signals were detected with full length, D1 and D2 Snail
promoter vectors but not with D3 and mutated Snail promoter
vectors, indicating that the binding of STAT3 on the Snail
promoter is dependent on the RE3 sequence within the Snail
promoter region (Figure 4B). To further confirm the STAT3
binding site in the endogenous Snail promoter, and whether
the binding of STAT3 reflects the actual endogenous Snail
promoter activations, we performed endogenous Q-ChIP
with primers specific to the Snail promoter REs (RE1-3)
in ATRT-CisR cells. The results, consistent with our reporter
and ChIP assays (Figure 4C), indicate STAT3 activates
endogenous Snail promoter activities through the same
targeting sequences as previous exogenous co-transfection
experiment results (Input, 2% of total lysate). To further
confirm the specific Snail promoter activation by STAT3
targeting sequences, we next generated reporter vectors
with either 6 repeats of the putative binding sequence
concluded by previous reporter and ChIP experiment results,
5′-TTACTCTGAA-3′, or 6 repeats of a mutated binding
sequence, 5′-TTACTCTGGG-3, upstream of ß-actin minimal
promoter in ATRT-CisR cells. The reporter assay results
showed that the binding sequence 5′-TTACTCTGAA-3′,
responsed to STAT3 overexpresions by 20-folds of increase
as compared with respective control experiments, while
6 repeats of mutated sequence were unable to response to
STAT3 induced transcriptional activation. (Figure 4D).
Taken together, we conclude that STAT3 directly regulates
Snail transcription through specific binding to the
sequence 5′-TTACTCTGAA-3′ in region RE3 of the Snail
promoter exogenously and endogenously. The STAT3/
Snail transcriptional regulator axis is the key for aberrant
malignancies of ATRT cells in our experimental systems.

The increase of Snail in invasive ATRT-CisR cells
led us to speculate that Snail may be a modulator of
STAT3-mediated EMT-like phenotypic cell motility and
invasion. We examined the causal link between STAT3
and Snail, and found that knockdown of endogenous
STAT3 downregulated Snail expression, but not vice versa
(Figure 3A). Knockdown of STAT3 or Snail decreased the
expression of N-cadherin and increased the expression of
E-cadherin, by immunofluorescence staining (Figure 3B).
In time-lapse microscopy, the low-STAT3 and low-Snail
ATRT-CisR cells had rounded shapes and displayed
substantially decreased motility in the 2.5D environment
(Figure 3C). Cells with knockdown of STAT3 or Snail had
reduced invasive ability compared with control cells (Figure
3D). Consistently, ectopic STAT3 expression increased
Snail protein expression, while ectopic overexpression of
Snail did not affect STAT3 expression or phosphorylation
(Figure 3E). Moreover, ectopic STAT3 or Snail enhanced
the expression of N-cadherin but attenuated the expression
of E-cadherin, based on immunofluorescence staining
(Figure 3F). Using time-lapse microscopy, we found more
rapid movement in the elongated high-STAT3 and highSnail ATRT-CisR cells in the 2.5D environment (Figure
3G). Moreover, cells overexpressing STAT3 or Snail
had higher invasive abilities than control cells (Figure
3H). Taken together, these results indicate that STAT3
upregulates Snail and contributes to tumor invasion and
motility in ATRT cells.

STAT3 directly regulates Snail transcription
Because STAT3 is a critical transcription factor
for modulating malignancies among many different
cancers, we next aimed to elucidate whether STAT3
enhances Snail expression through transcriptional
regulation. We screened for potential STAT3 binding
sites in a 1.3-Kb upstream sequence from the Snail
transcriptional start site and found three potential binding
regions (RE): RE1, 5′-TTTTTCAA-3′ (–1077 to –1070);
RE2, 5′-TTGAGGCAA-3′ (–1011 to –1003); and RE3:
5′-TTACTCTGAA-3′ (–909 to –900). To determine
whether STAT3 activates Snail expression is a promoter
sequence dependent, we constructed a series of Snail
promoter-driven luciferase reporter plasmids with a fulllength promoter, promoter regions with different lengths
of deletions (D1-3), or a promoter with mutations in the
potentially candidated binding sites (Mut; Figure 4A, left).
We then cotransfected a STAT3 expression vector with the
serial deletion constructs in ATRT cells as indicated. The
reporter assays demonstrated that RE3 was responsible for
STAT3-mediated promoter activity, suggesting that RE3 is
the STAT3 binding site (Figure 4A, right).

The STAT3/Snail axis regulates cancer stem-like
and tumor-initiating properties
Previous studies revealed that drug resistance is
usually enhanced in cancer stem-like cells [34, 35].
The increased cisplatin resistance in our established
ATRT-CisR cells raised the potential of these cells
to be cancer stem-like cells. Comparative analysis
between ATRT-Par and ATRT-CisR cells showed that
ATRT-CisR cells have higher sphere-forming ability
(Supplementary Figure 3A) and expressed higher
levels of stemness factors such as Oct-4, Nanog, Sox2,
Bmi-1, and Nestin (Supplementary Figure 3B). Flow
cytometry also showed that the expression level of
CD133 was dramatically increased in ATRT-CisR cells
(Supplementary Figure 3C).

As STAT3 and Snail are regulators of self-renewal
and cancer stem-like properties in several solid tissue
cancers [36], we hypothesized that the STAT3/Snail axis
activates cancer stem-like and tumor-initiating properties
in ATRT cells. We first investigated the involvement of
STAT3 and Snail in cancer stem-like properties and
tumor-initiating capability of ATRT-CisR cells using
sphere-forming and self-renewal assays. We observed
that STAT3 overexpression in ATRT-Par cells increased
sphere numbers through several passages of the sphereformation assay, indicating an increased self-renewal
capability, whereas simultaneous knockdown of Snail
attenuated the STAT3-increased self-renewal (Figure
5A–Figure 5B). Consistently, co-overexpression of Snail
rescued cells from inhibited self-renewal mediated by
STAT3 knockdown (Figure 5A–5B).
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

We next examined the stemness transcriptome profile
by gene expression microarray analysis (Figure 5C). Principle
component analysis (PCA) and multidimensional scaling
(MDS) analysis demonstrated that suppression of STAT3 in
ATRT-CisR cells diverted them away from ESCs; however,
Snail co-overexpression induced cells toward ESCs (Figure
5D–Figure 5E). Consistently, STAT3 overexpression in
ATRT-Par cells promoted a signature shift toward that of
ESCs, whereas co-knockdown of Snail diverted ATRTPar cells from ESCs (Figure 5D–Figure 5E). According to
bioinformatics data, we hypothesized that the STAT3/Snail
axis positively regulates cancer stem-like properties and
tumor-initiating capabilities in ATRT. We further analyzed
Nanog and Sox2 mRNA expression and showed that STAT3
knockdown in ATRT-CisR cells significantly decreased
mRNA levels of Nanog and Sox2, while they were increased

aimed to examine its involvement in chemoresistance in
ATRT cells. We subjected Par/Ctrl, Par/sh-STAT3, CisR/
sh-Scr, and CisR/sh-STAT3 cells derived from patients
to a colony-formation assay in the presence of cisplatin
ranging from 0 to 10 μg/ml (Pt1 and Pt2 ATRT cells had
similar results; Pt1 cells are shown as representative
results). Results showed that STAT3 knockdown severely
repressed cisplatin resistance in ATRT-CisR cells but not
in ATRT-Par cells. This is most likely due to the fact that
STAT3 expression is low in ATRT-Par cells, and attempts
to knockdown STAT3 did not alter STAT3 levels. The IC50
value of ATRT-Par/sh-Scr and ATRT-Par/sh-STAT3 were
approximately 3 μg/ml (Figure 6A, left), and the IC50
value of ATRT-CisR/sh-STAT3 was approximately 1 μg/
ml (Figure 6A, right). These IC50 values (3 μg/ml and
1 μg/ml) were used to treat ATRT-Par and ATRT-CisR stable

Given that STAT3 was initially identified by its
upregulation in cisplatin-selected resistant ATRT cells, we

Importantly, orthotopic grafts of the established ATRT clones
in mice demonstrated that Snail overexpression rescued the
tumor-initiating capability of CisR/sh-STAT3 cells, and Snail
knockdown partially reduced the tumor-initiating capability
of Par/STAT3 cells (Table 2). Taken together, we conclude
that STAT3 and Snail are both essential for promoting tumorinitiating capabilities in ATRT cancer cells and play a key
role in chemoresistance-induced cancer stem-like properties
of ATRT.

Figure 6: Decreasing STAT3/Snail signaling combined with cisplatin suppresses cell viability and upregulates ABCC1

cell lines, respectively, to evaluate the effect of the STAT3/
Snail axis in cisplatin resistance. Colony formation was
significantly decreased in ATRT-CisR/sh-STAT3 cells when
treated with cisplatin (1 μg/ml) compared with nontreated
ATRT-CisR/sh-STAT3 cells (Figure 6B, lower panel). This
reduction could be rescued by co-overexpression of Snail
(Figure 6B, lower panel). In contrast, cisplatin (3 μg/ml)
was not able to suppress the colony formation of ATRT-Par
cells with STAT3 overexpression, and co-transfection of shSnail partially decreased cisplatin resistance in ATRT-Par/
STAT3 cells (Figure 6B, upper panel).
Annexin V staining showed that ATRT-CisR/shSTAT3 cells had increased Annexin V staining, which was
further increased by cisplatin treatment (1 μg/ml), while
co-overexpression of Snail decreased the percentage of
Annexin V-positive cells (Figure 6C, bottom). In contrast,
STAT3 overexpression in ATRT-Par cells decreased the
percentage of Annexin V-positive cells, and cisplatin
treatment had limited ability to increase this percentage,
while co-knockdown of Snail dramatically increased
staining (Figure 6C, top). Three ATP-binding cassette
(ABC) drug transporters, ABCB1 (p-glycoprotein/MDR1),
ABCC1 (MRP1) and ABCG2 (BCRP), have been shown
to be involved in the development of drug resistance [37].
We examined the mRNA and protein expression levels
of ABCB1, ABCC1, and ABCG2 and observed ABCC1
reduction upon STAT3 knockdown in ATRT-CisR cells
and an ABCC1 level increase after STAT3 overexpression
in ATRT-Par cells (Figure 6D–Figure 6E). Flow cytometry
analysis further confirmed the positive correlation between
ABCC1 expression and activity of the STAT3/Snail axis in
ATRT-CisR cells (Figure 6F). Taken together, these results
showed that STAT3/Snail is crucial for the acquisition of
cisplatin resistance in ATRT cells and that ABCC1 is a
potential downstream target of the STAT3/Snail axis in
modulating cisplatin resistance.

tumors treated with cisplatin (1 μg/ml) had low invasive
characteristics, including large tumor islands and a clear
tumor boundary (Figure 7B, bottom), compared to ATRTCisR/sh-Scr tumors treated with cisplatin (1 μg/ml)
(Figure 7B, top). Notably, cisplatin showed a synergistic
effect with STAT3 knockdown to significantly reduce
tumor volumes in the transplanted mice (Figure 7C).
In contrast, ATRT-Par/Ctrl cells treated with
cisplatin showed slow tumor growth in transplanted
mice, and ectopic STAT3 effectively activated tumor
growth of ATRT-Par/Ctrl cells in the transplanted mice
(Supplementary Figure 4A). QPCR analysis confirmed
that the level of Nanog and Sox2 were significantly
decreased in xenograft tumor sections from ATRT-CisR/
sh-STAT3-transplanted mice compared with the levels
observed after all other treatments (Figure 7D). Compared
with untreated ATRT-CisR mice, sh-STAT3 combined with
cisplatin (1 μg/ml) significantly increased the survival rate
of mice bearing ATRT-CisR intracranial xenografts (Figure
7E). Moreover, compared with untreated ATRT-Partransplanted mice, ectopic expression of STAT3 resulted
in decreased survival rate of intracranial xenograft-bearing
mice (Supplementary Figure 4B). These results indicated
that the STAT3/Snail axis regulates drug resistance
and cancer stem-like properties in xenotransplanted
immunocompromised mice.

Upregulation of STAT3 and Snail expression in
clinical samples of recurrent ATRT
To confirm the results derived from in vitro and
animal experiments, we next investigated the levels of
STAT3 and Snail by IHC staining in samples from nine
ATRT patients. The properties of these patients were
noted (Table 1), and representative IHC results are shown
in Figure 8A. We observed that the IHC grading of Snail
was closely related to STAT3 expression in the nine
ATRT patients. As shown in Table 1, eight of the nine
patients received full course chemotherapy after their 1st
surgery. However, in five patients (patients 1, 2, 4, 7,
and 8), the tumor relapsed, and the patients underwent
a second surgery. The percentage of STAT3- and Snailpositive cells were dramatically increased in the four
of five tumor-relapse samples (patients 1, 2, 4, and 8)
compared with the tumor samples from the first surgery
(Figure 8B). The results seem to revelaed the levels
of STAT3/snail may predict the recurrence of ATRT
patients. In support of the closely associated relationship
of the two molecules in patient samples, we confirmed
the colocalization between STAT3 and Snail in the
same foci of ATRT tissue from Pt1 with STAT3hi Snailhi
(Figure 8C). In summary, we found that cisplatin-selected
resistance (oncogenic resistance) transactivates STAT3/
Snail pathway, and the axis regulates tumor migration/
invasion, cancer stem-like cell properties, and cisplatin
resistance in ATRT cells (Figure 8D).

Abrogation of STAT3/Snail axis synergistically
improves the efficacy of chemotherapy and
prolongs the survival of recipients of
ATRT-CisR cells
We further investigated the role of the STAT3/Snail
signaling and its effects on cisplatin treatment in ATRTPar and ATRT-CisR cells in vivo. ATRT-CisR cells were
labeled with red fluorescent protein (RFP) by lentiviral
infection with a vector containing the RFP gene. A total
of 1 × 105 ATRT-Par and ATRT-CisR cells with different
treatment protocols were injected into the stratum of
SCID mice, and tumor size was monitored by 3T MRI
for 6 weeks. RFP imaging revealed that tumor volumes in
mice transplanted with ATRT-CisR/sh-STAT3 cells were
significantly decreased with cisplatin (1 μg/ml) compared
to ATRT-CisR/sh-Scr cells with cisplatin (1 μg/ml) (Figure
7A). Examination of paraffin sections of xenograft tumors
from dissected brains showed that ATRT-CisR/sh-STAT3

DISCUSSION

Snail is highly correlated in different cancer cell lines;
(ii) cisplatin treatment selects not only for resistance but
also for a more oncogenic phenotype characterized by
high self-renewal and invasive capabilities; (iii) STAT3
directly regulates Snail transcription and activation of
STAT3/Snail pathway contributes to tumor invasion,
chemoresistance and cancer stem-like properties;
(iv) suppression of Snail in STAT3-overexpressing ATRT
cells reduced cisplatin resistance; and (v) coexpression
of STAT3 and Snail in primary ATRT samples enhanced
cisplatin resistance and correlated with worse prognosis.
We demonstrated that cisplation can activate “oncogenictype” of drug resistance and Snail plays a crucial role
in STAT3-dependent induction of oncogenic phenotype,
such as cisplatin resistance, tumor invasion and cancer
stem-like properties. To our knowledge, the present study
is the first to show that STAT3 directly regulates Snail
transcription and promotes platinum resistance.

ATRT is the most common primary pediatric
tumor of the CNS and has limited treatment options
and a dismal prognosis. Because of the rarity of ATRT
and resistance to therapeutic regimens, no standard
chemotherapy regimen has been established [38].
Although cisplatin-based chemotherapy is a mainstay
treatment of ATRT, drug resistance frequently develops
[39]. Many studies have attributed chemoresistance and
tumor recurrence to the existence of a subset of CSCs or
cancer-initiating cells that possess stem-like properties
and are able to repopulate tumors [19]. Recently, studies
have indicated that therapy induced “oncogenic-type”
may be involve in self-renewal, cancer invasiveness,
drug resistance, and EMT, as well as share the properties
of CSCs [11]. In this study, we are able to provide
the following findings: (i) expression of STAT3 and

It has been reported that oncogenic resistance is
associated with highly aggressive cancer phenotype,
and modulates the therapeutics-induced cell cycle arrest
and apoptosis [11]. For example, hypoxia transactivates
genes, such as autocrine or paracrine growth factors,
that are critical for invasion and metastasis during the
antiangiogenic therapy [40]. Furthermore, some study
revealed Bcr-Abl mutation-mediated drug resistance
led to activation of Stat3 associated with malignant cell
transformation [41]. Moreover, Src confers resistance to
Adriamycin that was associated with the interaction of
p21waf1 with the STAT3 transcription factor at the Myc
promoter [42]. Consistent with these previous reports, our
study found that cisplatin can cause “oncogenic-type” of
drug resistance which simultaneously activates STAT3/
Snail pathway to make cell aggressive, such as tumor
invasion and cancer stem-like capability in ATRT-CisR
cells. These findings indicated that chemotherapeutic
resistance may contribute to adapt the cancer stem-like
capability and simultaneously makes cells more aggressive
phenotype in ATRT-CisR cells, in partly through
activation of STAT3/Snail pathway. Therefore, the more
future studies are needed to explore whether oncogenic
reistance play an important role in the development of
EMT-derived invasiveness and cancer reprogramming
in CSCs or surrogate markers of therapeutic response in
patients with ATRT.
STAT3 is frequently activated in various cancers
and plays a crucial role in enhancing EMT and increasing
invasiveness outside the CNS [43]. For example, wogonin
suppresses tumor cell migration by inactivating the STAT3
signaling pathway in human alveolar cell adenocarcinomas
[44]. Activation of the STAT3 pathway is required for
IL-6-induced EMT in the progression of human cervical
carcinomas [45]. STAT3 is also associated with sphereforming efficiency as well as cancer stem cell-like
functions in nasopharyngeal carcinoma and breast cancer
[46, 47]. Induction of STAT3 signaling was associated
with enhanced chemoresistance of cancer cells, while a
STAT3 inhibitor was able to enhance chemosensitivity
in epithelial ovarian cancer cells [48]. In ovarian cancer,
high expression levels of STAT3 were shown to promote
cisplatin resistance [49]. Consistent with these reports,
we found that the STAT3 pathway is a key mechanism
to link tumor invasion, chemoresistance and cancer stemlike properties in ATRT. In addition, EMT, the major cause
of invasion, has been shown to activate chemoresistance
and induce the acquisition of cancer stem-like properties
[13]. However, very few reports have investigated the
underlying mechanism between chemoresistance and
cancer invasion with EMT-like properties in ATRT.
Previous studies revealed an involvement of STAT3
in EMT through inhibition of E-cadherin expression
in colorectal cancer [50]. Moreover, the STAT3/miR34a/Snail axis promotes EMT-mediated colorectal
cancer invasion and metastasis [29]. However, the exact
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

mechanism between STAT3 and EMT is still unclear.
Recent studies have shown that STAT3 directly binds to
the promoter region of Beclin1 in lung cancer [51]. Here,
we demonstrated that STAT3 positively promoted Snail
transcription by directly binding to the Snail promoter.
Snail acts as a zinc-finger transcription factor that
is essential for inducing the EMT phenotype. Previous
studies reported that Snail plays important roles in the
EMT phenotype of many cancer types outside of the
CNS [52]. In our studies, we found an increase of Snail
expression in ATRT-CisR cells compared with ATRTPar cells. Suppression of Snail attenuated the migration
and invasion in ATRT-Par/STAT3 cells. Our previous
report demonstrated that ectopic expression of Snail
promotes cancer stem like-cell activities by increasing
IL-8 expression in human colorectal cancer cells [53].
A recent study reported that Snail directly regulates
Nanog expression and enhances tumor-initiating
cell characteristics [54]. In the current study, ectopic
expression of Snail rescued the shSTAT3-suppressed
expression of Nanog and Sox2, self-renewal ability, and
tumor-initiating abilities in ATRT-CisR/sh-STAT3 cells.
Based on these studies and our data, we suggest that
elevated Snail expression is responsible for the increase
in the EMT-like phenotype, tumor invasion, and cancer
stem-like cell properties in ATRT-CisR cells.
Three ATP-binding cassette (ABC) drug transporters
have been associated with drug resistance in most cancers
[55], and the ABCB1 (p-glycoprotein/MDR1), ABCC1
(MRP1) and ABCC2 (MRP2) subfamilies have been
shown to be involved in the development of cisplatin
resistance [56–59].Though cisplatin is one of the most
commonly used chemotherapeutic drugs in most solid
cancers including ATRT [36, 60], treatment with cisplatin
always induces multidrug resistance along with suppressed
apoptosis pathway and activated EMT [61]. Hsu et al.
revealed that ectopic expression of Snail in primary
head and neck cancer samples may result in cisplatin
resistance and poor outcome [62]. However, the molecular
mechanism of Snail-dependent induction of drug
resistance in ATRT is unclear. We showed in this study that
Snail overexpression not only increased cell viability after
cisplatin treatment but also enhanced ABCC1 expression
in ATRT-CisR/sh-STAT3 cells. Conversely, knockdown of
Snail caused a distinct suppression of cell viability and
attenuated the expression of ABCC1 in ATRT-Par/STAT3
cells. Taken together, these data suggest that Snail confers
cisplatin resistance to ATRT-CisR cells through ABCC1.
In conclusion, our study showed that cisplatin
treatment selects induced oncogenic type of drug resistance,
simultaneously increased migration and invasion abilities as
well as EMT-like phenotype, and promoted the acquisition
of stem-like properties in ATRT cells through activation of
the STAT3/Snail pathway. We suggest that Snail is a key
molecule linking EMT and chemoresistance because it
regulates the expression of not only EMT-related genes but
1764

Oncotarget

also the ABCC1 transporter. We believe that STAT3/Snail
signaling plays an important role in oncogenic resistance
and could be a potential treatment target to inhibit ATRT
invasion and to enhance the efficacy of chemotherapeutic
drugs, such as cisplatin. Our study provides insight for the
development of future therapies that attempt to overcome
cisplatin resistance, which is frequently observed with
current ATRT treatment regimens.

seeding on top of collagen, we first seeded the cells on
plastic dishes at 50% confluence. After 37°C for 10 min,
we collected the cells by trypsinizing them with 0.1%
trypsin in EDTA, suspended the cells at concentration of
0.4 x 106 ml−1 and confirmed that the suspended cells were
single cells by microscopic examination. A 1.6 mg ml−1
collagen solution (3 ml) was prepared by mixing 1.6 ml of
3 mg ml−1, 0.6 ml of 5x medium, PureCor bovine collagen
solution, and 20 μl of 1 M NaOH, then adding water
to a total volume of 3 ml. The collagen was allowed to
polymerize in the tissue culture incubator at 37°C for 2
h. First, we prepared the thick collagen-coated dishes for
culturing cells on top of thick collagen (2.5D) and then
plated the cells on top of the collagen; an appropriate
amount of serum-containing culture medium was added.
By microscopic examination, we confirmed that the cells
suspended in collagen were single cells and performed
the cell-collagen mixture with a known amount of serumcontaining medium. The experiments indicating cellular
imaging in 2.5D conditions were performed using cells
collected from 2.5D cultures.

METHODS
Cell culture
All procedures of sample acquisition follow the tenets
of the Declaration of Helsinki and have been approved by
Institutional Review Committee at Taipei Veterans General
Hospital. Between January 1998 and April 2011, a total of
32 patients with ATRT were treated at our hospital [63–65].
We had nine samples from ATRT patients. There were three
females and six males as shown in Table 1. In brief, the
tissues were washed in glucose containing Hanks’ balanced
salt solution, (HBSS; Invitrogen/Life Technologies,
Carlsbad, CA, USA) three times after surgical removal
of the ATRT tissues. Then, these tissues were sliced at
a thickness of 300 mm and immersed in 0.1% (w/w)
collagenase (Sevapharma, Prague, Czech Republic) in
glucose-containing HBSS at 37°C/15 min and shaken on a
rotation shaker at 125 rpm. All cells were cultured in RPMI
(Gibco® 1640) with 10% FBS and antibiotics in 5% CO2
at 37°C. Analysis of cell morphology was performed using
a Zeiss Axiovert 25 Phase Contrast Inverted Microscope.
Digital images were captured using a Canon Power Shot
G10 equipped with a Carl Zeiss 426126 lens.

Analysis of cell morphology
We analyzed the cell morphology according to a
previous report [66]. The area and the perimeter of the
cells were defined by drawing around the cell shape in
phase-contrast images and determined by ImageJ software.
The morphology index was calculated as the perimeter2/4π
area. We hypothesized that the ratio of a round cell is 1.0,
and an elongated cell has an increased index. For every
clone, the mean value of the index was determined from
200 cells.

RT2 profiler PCR array

Quantification of the speed of motile cells by
time-lapse microscopy

The Human Cell motility and Human Epithelial to
Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) RT2 Profiler PCR Array
that profiles the expression of 84 key genes was purchased
from SABiosciences (Frederick, MD) and used as
recommended by manufacturer. RT-PCRs were performed
in 96-well plate format using the ABI 7500 FAST RealTime PCR System. Fold changes in cell motility and
EMT gene expression from denervated samples relative
to control samples were calculated using the ΔΔCt method
using the integrated software package for PCR Array
Systems provided by the manufacturer (RT2 Profiler PCR
Array Data Analysis Template v3.3). ΔΔCt values from
each sample were normalized to three housekeeping genes
that did not change across the conditions.

Time-lapse microscopic observations of cell motility
were performed as described previously [67]. In a 2.5D
culture, we used a 3.5-cm dish with 1 ml of the 1.6 mg ml–1
collagen solution, seeded 1 x 105 cells on top of the collagen
and then added 1.2 ml of medium. Cells were allowed to
adhere for 18 h and were then observed in humidified,
CO2-equilibrated chamber with a motorized-stage-equipped
LumascopeTM series for 24 h. The images were managed
and reconstructed with ZEN 2009 Light Edition software.
To quantify the speed of cells in the 2.5D system, we
tracked the movements of individual cells with the ImageJ
software Mtracking plugin analysis in a randomly selected
high-power field. The cell motility speed was calculated
and is presented as micrometers per minute. Each cell was
tracked for identification of speed in 2.5D culture. All of
the fractions of individual cells for speed identification
were more than 85%. The fractions of individual cells
for each clone in the speed identification experiments are
described in the figure legends.
