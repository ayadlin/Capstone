BACKGROUND. The objective of the current study was to determine the outcome of
children with local recurrence or progression of medulloblastoma in patients who
received high-dose chemotherapy (HDC) and posterior fossa (PF) irradiation.

METHODS. HDC consisted in busulfan at a dose of 600 mg/m2 and thiotepa at a
dose of 900 mg/m2 followed by autologous stem cells transplantation (ASCT). PF
radiotherapy was delivered at doses from 50 grays (Gy) to 55 Gy on Day 170 after
ASCT. Twenty-seven patients developed local recurrence of an initially completely
resected medulloblastoma. Twelve patients had local residual disease after surgery

edulloblastoma is one of the most common malignant brain
tumors in children. Despite gradual improvements in the survival rate over the last decades, infants and young children still have
a dismal prognosis with poor overall survival (OS) and high treatment-related morbidity.1 Greater attention has been given to longterm sequelae (with special concerns regarding neurocognitive
impairment) as the treatment for medulloblastoma has become more
effective. Although a variety of factors play a role in the development
of such sequelae, it has been demonstrated that age at diagnosis, perioperative complications, and craniospinal irradiation (CSI) are the
major causes of this impairment.2–5

cooperative groups have designed strategies based on
prolonged conventional chemotherapy to delay or
avoid radiotherapy.6–8 In patients with recurrent disease, salvage strategy usually includes CSI with posterior fossa (PF) boost; however, radiotherapy still puts
a serious strain on the neurocognitive outcome,
because most patients are young.9,10 In 1990, the
French Society of Pediatric Oncology (SFOP) Brain Tumor Committee elaborated both an initial strategy,
which was based on conventional adjuvant chemotherapy without radiation (the Baby Brain SFOP
[BBSFOP] protocol), and a salvage treatment, which
was based on high-dose chemotherapy (HDC) followed by autologous stem cell rescue (ASCR) and
involved-field radiotherapy.11 The HDC regimen consisted of high-dose busulfan and thiotepa, because
encouraging results were reported from a Phase II
study of children with refractory, malignant brain
tumors12 and also because of the effectiveness of the
regimen in avoiding CSI.13 In this report, we present
the results from this salvage HDC regimen associated
with local-field radiotherapy in children with local
disease recurrence/progression of medulloblastoma.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Selection
Children with standard-risk medulloblastoma who
were diagnosed before age 5 years were treated with
conventional adjuvant chemotherapy, without irradiation, according to the BBSFOP protocol.11 Salvage
strategies were indicated in the protocol according to
the results from the initial pilot studies.12,13
Children who presented with local failure, either
during or after BBSFOP chemotherapy, were considered eligible for salvage treatment with high-dose
busulfan and thiotepa and PF irradiation (PFRT).
Local failure was defined as radiologic reappearance
or progression of disease at the original site. An intermediate analysis of the BBSFOP study in 1996 indicated that conventional chemotherapy was unable
to control overt residual disease; thus, the protocol
was amended, and patients then received HDC and
PFRT as initial treatment (results to be reported elsewhere). Informed consent for the salvage procedure
was obtained from the parents separately at the initial treatment with conventional chemotherapy. Children who had metastatic recurrences in craniospinal
fluid and/or on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
studies were excluded from this study and received
a sequential HDC and craniospinal radiotherapy regimen.11 The diagnosis of medulloblastoma was
confirmed after a central pathology review in all
patients.

157

Treatment Regimen
Salvage therapy consisted of oral busulfan at a dose
of 150 mg/m2 per day (37.5 mg/m2 every 6 hours)
for 4 consecutive days on Days 8, 7, 6, and 5,
and thiotepa at a dose of 300 mg/m2 per day for the
next 3 days on Days 4, 3, and 2, administered as
a 1-hour intravenous infusion. Autologous stem cells
(either bone marrow or peripheral stem cells) were
reinfused 48 hours after the completion of chemotherapy, on Day 0. During the 7 days of chemotherapy, hyperhydration (3 L/m2 per day) was
administered, and all patients received clonazepam
during chemotherapy to prevent busulfan-related seizures. Ursodeoxycholic acid was given orally at a
dose of 300 mg/m2 per day from Day 9 to Day 180
to reduce the risk of hepatic veno-occlusive disease
(VOD).14 All patients received granulocyte colony-stimulating factor at a dose of 5 mcg/kg per day starting 5 days after ASCR until their neutrophil count
recovered to >0.5 3 109/L. Platelet transfusions were
administered to maintain the platelet count at
>50 3 109/L, and packed red cell transfusions were
given to maintain hemoglobin levels at >7 g/dL. Febrile neutropenia was treated with broad-spectrum
antibiotics and antifungal or antiviral agents, as
appropriate. Parenteral nutrition was given when
necessary. All patients were hospitalized in the transplantation unit in single rooms with laminar air-flow.
Starting in 1996, as soon as they entered the salvage protocol and before they received HDC, children received 2 courses of etoposide at a dose of 100
mg/m2 per day as a 1-hour infusion from Day 1 to
Day 5 and carboplatin at a dose of 160 mg/m2 per
day as a 1-hour infusion also from Day 1 to Day 5.
Combined chemotherapy with etoposide and carboplatin was adopted for peripheral stem cell mobilization.
Surgery
Maximal surgical removal was recommended whenever possible. It usually was performed in patients
with residual disease after HDC and before radiotherapy. In some cases, children underwent surgery
before they received HDC, either at the time they
entered the salvage protocol or after 2 courses of etoposide plus carboplatin.
Resection was considered total if the neurosurgeon recorded total resection with no recognizable
residual disease or tumor adhesions both in the surgical report and on postoperative imaging studies
that were negative for macroscopic residual disease,
in accordance with guidelines from the International
Society of Pediatric Oncology.15 If patients had radiologic residual disease or incomplete resection on

158

the surgical report, then resection was considered
less than total.

Radiotherapy
Radiotherapy was delivered only to the PF after at least
70 days after the day of autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT). Initial radiotherapy with 2 opposed lateral beams was adopted to treat the entire PF at doses
from 50 Gy to 55 Gy in 1.8-Gy daily fractions over
6 weeks. CSI at 35 Gy was indicated only in patients
with progressive disease after HDC. In the most recent
years, since 1997, children received conformal PF RT
at a dose of 35 Gy with an additional boost of 15 Gy
restricted to the tumor bed.
Toxicity Criteria
Toxicity criteria were graded according to the
National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria
(version 3.0).16 Liver toxicity was graded according to
the Bearman toxicity criteria.17
Tumor Response
Tumor response was assessed by MRI studies that
were obtained 6 weeks after HDC and before the
start of radiotherapy. Children who received 2
courses of standard chemotherapy also were evaluated by MRI studies before the administration of
HDC. Response was defined according to published
criteria for tumor response in children with brain
tumors.18
Radiologic and Neuropsychological Follow-up
After the completion of the treatment, children
underwent clinical examinations and MRI neuroimaging every 3 months during the first 2 years and every 6 to 12 months thereafter. Neurodevelopmental
tests were scheduled to be administered between 6
months to 1 year after radiotherapy and annually
thereafter. Children were tested with age-adapted
Wechsler scales.19,20
Statistical Analysis
OS rates were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier
method21 and were calculated from the date of radiologic diagnosis of recurrence or progression to the
date of death or last follow-up visit for patients who
remained alive. Progression-free survival (PFS) rates
were estimated using the above-mentioned method
from the date of radiologic recurrence or progression
to the date of either documented failure (date of
radiologic or clinical recurrence or death) or the last
follow-up visit for patients in complete remission
(CR). The 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) for survival rates were estimated using the Rothman

method.22 Follow-up data were updated in February
2007.

RESULTS
History Before HDC
Between January 1988 and July 2005, 39 children in 8
French pediatric oncology departments were enrolled
in the study. The median age at diagnosis was
31 months (range, 8–58 months), and the median
age at the time patients were started on the salvage
protocol was 39 months (range, 11–80 months).
All children had previously received the conventional BBSFOP chemotherapy. Twenty-seven children
who underwent complete surgical removal developed
local disease recurrence during or after BBSFOP
chemotherapy (median delay of recurrence, 8 months;
range, 1–17 months), and 12 children experienced
the progression of local surgical residual disease during chemotherapy (median delay of progression,
5 months; range, 1–14 months).
None of these 39 children presented with distant
metastases at the time of enrolment or had evidence of
distant metastases in craniospinal fluid samples or on
craniospinal MRI studies. At the initial histopathologic
examination, 27 children had classic medulloblastoma, 11 children had desmoplastic medulloblastoma,
and 1 child had medullomyoblastoma.
Twenty-five children received other additional
treatments prior to HDC. Nine children underwent
surgery, 7 of whom underwent radiologically complete removal of the tumor. Seventeen children
received 2 courses of etoposide plus carboplatin to
allow stem cell collection while treating the disease
with the most effective conventional chemotherapy
combination23: Two of those patients achieved CR
with this chemotherapy regimen, 9 patients achieved
a partial response (PR), 3 patients had stable disease,
and 3 patients were not evaluable because of previous complete surgical removal of their tumor. Four
children received just 1 course of etoposide plus carboplatin (2 PRs and 2 responses that were not evaluated), and 2 children received 1 and 4 courses of
other chemotherapies (etoposide plus cyclophosphamide and high-dose ifosfamide, respectively). In
total, 13 of 18 cases of disease recurrence/progression (72%) responded to the combination of etoposide and carboplatin. At the time HDC was initiated,
30 children had measurable disease, and 9 children
were in CR because of surgery or chemotherapy.
Response to HDC
Twenty-nine patients who had measurable disease
remained alive and were evaluable for response at

the end of HDC. Among them, 9 patients achieved a
CR, and 9 patients achieved a PR, resulting in an
objective response rate of 62%. Seven children had
stable disease, and 4 patients had progressive disease.

Surgery After HDC
Nine of 20 children who had residual disease after
HDC underwent surgical removal. In 5 of those children, a macroscopic total resection was performed,
and the other 4 children underwent a less than macroscopic total resection. In 2 patients, no tumor cells
were found. In 7 of 9 children, histologic examination of the residual tumor showed the presence of
viable medulloblastoma cells; however, in 2 of those
children, the pathologist identified just a few isolated
medulloblastoma cells inside a fully fibrotic tissue.

Acute Toxicity After Transplantation
Acute toxicity of the high-dose busulfan plus thiotepa regimen was similar to the toxicity described
previously by our group with this regimen.12,13,24 The
median duration of neutropenia <0.5 3 109/L was 9
days (range, 6–21 days), and the median duration of
thrombocytopenia <50 3 109/L was 30 days (range,
5–120 days).
Severe infectious complications occurred in 11
children, including 7 patients who presented with
bacterial septicemia, 3 patients with focal pneumonias, and 1 patient with pulmonary aspergillosis. Two
toxic deaths were observed among 39 children
(5.1%), both of which were caused by infectious
complications: one case was related to Staphylococcus aureus septicemia with acute respiratory distress
syndrome, and 1 case was related to pulmonary
aspergillosis.
Hepatic VOD occurred in 13 of 39 children
(33.3%). In 5 of 39 children (12.8%), grade 3 VOD
was observed. Clinical recovery was possible in all
patients with symptomatic treatment, not including
defibrotide. There was no correlation noted between
the incidence or severity of VOD and previous chemotherapy.
ASCT consisted of bone marrow in 12 children,
peripheral stem cells in 26 children, and both in 1
child. The median duration of hospitalization in the
transplantation unit was 40 days (range, 24–97 days).
Radiotherapy
Among the 39 children who were included in the
current study, 37 children completed radiotherapy.
One child died during HDC, and 1 child died during
radiotherapy, both from infectious complications.
Among the 37 irradiated children, 4 patients received

craniospinal irradiation in addition to the PF boost
because of progressive disease during chemotherapy.
One patient was treated with g-knife radiation (a
major protocol violation), and he experienced a local
recurrence a few months later and died of tumor
progression. Thirty-two patients received local radiotherapy on the PF only at a dose of 50 grays (Gy) to
54 Gy in 1.8-Gy daily fractions. Twenty-two patients
were irradiated on the entire PF; whereas, after 1997,
10 children received conformal radiotherapy at a
dose of 35 Gy on the PF with a boost of 15 Gy to the
tumor bed. The 4 children who received CSI received
radiotherapy to the whole PF.

Outcome and Treatment Failure
For the entire cohort of 39 children, the 5-year OS
and event-free survival (EFS) estimates were 68.8%
(95% CI, 53–81.2%) and 61.5% (95% CI, 45.9–75.1%),
respectively (Fig. 1). EFS and OS for both patient
subgroups are shown in Figures 2 and 3.
Patients who developed a local recurrence of a
previous completely removed medulloblastoma had
a 5-year OS estimate of 77.2% (95% CI, 58.3–89.1%)
and a 5-year EFS estimate of 66.7% (95% CI, 47.8–
81.4%). Patients who developed local progression of
postsurgical radiologic residual disease during
BBSFOP chemotherapy had a 5-year OS estimate of
50% (95% CI, 25.4–74.6%) and a 5-year EFS estimate
of 50% (95% CI, 25.4–74.6%).
Treatment failures occurred in 13 patients within
the first 2 years of salvage therapy, and the median
delay of disease recurrence was 10 months (range,

7–24 months). Patterns of recurrence were as follows:
5 local recurrences, 4 metastatic disseminations, and
4 synchronous local and metastatic recurrences. One
patient who developed a PF recurrence among the
10 patients who received reduced PF irradiation, and
3 of 23 patients underwent whole PF irradiation
(Fisher exact test; P value not significant).
Among the 37 evaluable patients, disease recurrences were observed in 1 of 18 patients who were in
CR after HDC and in 12 of 19 patients who were not
in CR after HDC (including patients who entered CR
after further surgery or radiotherapy; (chi-square test;
P 5 .0002). The patterns of failure did not differ
depending on the 2 different therapeutic situations.

Neuroradiologic Abnormalities at Follow-up
In 9 of 39 patients (23%), a peculiar phenomenon of
brain injury was observed on follow-up imaging studies (Fig. 4). Brain lesions that were characterized by
abnormal contrast enhancement on MRI studies,
with a punctiform aspect or a giriform distribution,
and without mass effect, appeared with a median
delay of 6 months (range, 1–18 months) after the
completion of radiotherapy. The localization of these
lesions could be cortical or subcortical, but in all
cases they appeared only inside the irradiation field.
The majority of the children (6 of 9 patients) were
asymptomatic at onset, whereas 3 children presented
with a worsening of their cerebellar deficit. These

lesions evolved spontaneously or after corticosteroids
toward regression in 8 of 9 patients (88%) after 6 to
12 months with the appearance of calcifications. Pretransplantation treatment did not appear to have an
impact on the occurrence of this complication.

Neurocognitive Development
At the most recent evaluation, among the 20 children
who had at least 1 Intellectual Quotient (IQ) examination after salvage treatment at a median follow-up
of 5.8 years after diagnosis, the mean estimated fullscale IQ (FSIQ), verbal IQ, and performance IQ
values were 71.8 (range, 40–100), 79.3 (range, 45–
110), and 70.6 (range, 45–101), respectively. The median age at the last evaluation was 7.5 years (range,
4.7–15.2 years). The FSIQ tended to decrease over
time at a mean rate of 2 points per year from the
date of diagnosis (Fig. 5).
No statistically significant difference was
observed in the mean FSIQ of 69.3 in 9 of 20 children with who had radiologic abnormalities at follow-up compared with the mean FSIQ of 73.8 in 11
of 20 children who had normal MRI studies (Student
t test; P value not significant). Among the 12 children
who were aged <3 years at the time of diagnosis, the
mean FSIQ at a mean follow-up of 70 months was
70.6 (range, 50–94) whereas, among the 8 children
who were aged >3 years at diagnosis, the mean FSIQ
at a mean follow-up of 43 months was 73.6 (range,
40–100; Student t test; P value not significant).

Nine months after the completion of treatment, her ataxia worsened together with the appearance of abnormal gadolinium enhancement in the radiation field. Using steroid therapy only, her neurologic situation improved
and the radiologic images gradually decreased.

DISCUSSION
Young children with medulloblastoma who develop
local recurrence or disease progression after conventional chemotherapy can be treated effectively with
the combined strategy of high-dose busulfan plus
thiotepa and radiotherapy to the PF, as demonstrated
in the current study by the observed high 5-year OS
rate of 68.8%. To our knowledge, there is no compa-

rable series in the literature. Standard CSI-based salvage therapies yielded a 5-year OS rate of 37% in 13
patients aged <4 years who had M0 medulloblastoma and received treatment with conventional
chemotherapy only at the time of diagnosis25; there
is no indication in this publication that the efficacy
of the salvage strategy depended on the type of disease recurrence or progression. It is worth noting
that, in our strategy, we used only focal irradiation
and therefore induced fewer long-term neurologic
side effects.
Acute toxicity was manageable but characterized
mainly by a significant percentage of hepatic VOD in
33% of patients. None of the children died of liver
toxicity. This liver toxicity reportedly is caused
mainly by busulfan but can be modified by the
accompanying drug.26 It is likely that the rate and severity of VOD could be decreased by refinement of
the use of busulfan (ie, an intravenous form of
busulfan27) or by the prophylactic use of defibrotide.28
Delayed toxicities from the treatment strategy
included mainly the gonads and the central nervous
system. Major toxicity includes the risk of irreversible
ovarian failure resulting from the use of high-dose
busulfan, as reported by Teinturier et al, who
observed a 100% rate of severe and persistent ovarian
failure in 10 female patients with a median follow-up
of 7 years who were treated during childhood with

162

CANCER

high-dose busulphan-containing regimens.29 Cryopreservation of ovarian tissue is an option to address
the sterility issue; although, currently, it is only at the
experimental level.30,31
Neurotoxicity has been observed as a delayed
side effect characterized by transient radiologic
anomalies in the irradiated fields in 23% of patients.
The pathophysiologic hypothesis of this phenomenon is in favor of blood-brain barrier damage secondary to disruption of the endothelium of small
vessels induced by either radiotherapy, HDC, or
(most likely) a combination of both treatments being
‘‘guilty by association.’’32 Indeed, busulfan alone
has no delayed neurologic toxicity,33 and PF irradiation only at the doses used in the current study
rarely has been associated with radionecrosis. Busulfan is a known radiosensitizer with documented skin
reactions.34 Calcifications are the latest consequence
of this microangiopathic phenomena and have
been described previously in other radiochemotherapic interactions, such as those observed with
methotrexate.
The cognitive outcome associated with the current strategy, with a median FSIQ of 71.8 at 5.8 years
of follow-up, is an improvement on previously
reported results after CSI-based salvage therapy (median FSIQ, 62 at 4.8 years of follow-up in children
aged <4 years at diagnosis).25 Despite the positive d
in IQ values between the 2 different salvage protocols, long-term intelligence outcomes still were unsatisfactory. To enhance the quality of life of long-term
survivors, future clinical research should focus on
improving the cognitive outcome. Possible strategies
may be represented by the adoption of new radiotherapy techniques (ie, proton radiotherapy, reduced
boost volumes, or the use of hyperfractionated radiotherapy). Changing the type of drugs in the HDC
regimen may not lower the risk of radiochemotherapeutic interactions, because these phenomena already have been described with thiotepa35 and
cyclophosphamide.36
In conclusion, the results from this multicenter
study indicated that the combination of busulfan
and thiotepa with PF irradiation is an efficient salvage regimen in children with medulloblastoma who
develop recurrent or progressive local disease. Currently, we are evaluating whether this regimen would
be more useful for patients with medulloblastoma
who have local residual disease if it was administered
at the time of diagnosis. Its immediate toxicity is
manageable and may be improved with more specific treatments of VOD; however, delayed neurologic
and gynecologic side effects remain main concerns
and warrant treatment refinements.
