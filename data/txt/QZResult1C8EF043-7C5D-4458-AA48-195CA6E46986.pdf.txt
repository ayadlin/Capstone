BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to evaluate the clinical benefits of systemic chemotherapy for
patients with metastatic pheochromocytomas or sympathetic paragangliomas by assessing reductions in tumor size
and blood pressure and improvements in overall survival (OS). METHODS: The authors retrospectively reviewed the
medical records of patients with metastatic pheochromocytomas-sympathetic paragangliomas who had received
chemotherapy at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. RESULTS: Clinical benefit and OS were
assessed. Of 54 patients who received chemotherapy, 52 patients were evaluable for response. Seventeen patients
(33%) experienced a response, which was defined as decreased or normalized blood pressure/decreased number and
dosage of antihypertensive medications and/or reduced tumor size after the first chemotherapy regimen. The median
OS was 6.4 years (95% confidence interval [CI], 5.2-16.4 years) for responders and 3.7 years (95% CI, 3.0-7.5 years)
for nonresponders. Among the patients who had synchronous metastatic disease, a positive response at 1 year after
the start of chemotherapy was associated with a trend toward longer OS (log-rank test; P ¼ .095). In a multivariate
Cox proportional hazards model, the effect of response to chemotherapy on OS was significant (hazard ratio, 0.22;
95% CI, interval: 0.05-1.0; P ¼ .05). All responders had received dacarbazine and cyclophosphamide. Vincristine was
included for 14 responders, and doxorubicin was included for 12 responders. The clinical factors that predicted
response to chemotherapy could not be identified. CONCLUSIONS: The current results indicted that chemotherapy
may decrease tumor size and facilitate blood pressure control in approximately 33% of patients with metastatic pheochromocytoma-sympathetic paraganglioma. These patients exhibited longer survival. Cancer 2012;118:2804-12.

INTRODUCTION

Pheochromocytomas and sympathetic extra-adrenal paragangliomas are rare neuroendocrine tumors that
arise, respectively, from chromaffin cells in the adrenal medulla and in paraganglia in the thorax, abdomen, and pelvis.
Pheochromocytomas and sympathetic paragangliomas together have an estimated incidence of 0.95 cases per 100,000
person-years in the United States.1 The previously reported metastasis rate of these tumors was 10%.2-4 However, in a
recent comprehensive study of clinical predictors of metastases in patients with pheochromocytoma and sympathetic paraganglioma, the estimated metastasis rate actually was 17.2%.5

Patients with metastatic tumors present a unique
clinical challenge. They have high morbidity and mortality rates from excessive catecholamine secretion, hypertension, cardiovascular complications, and bulky disease for
which no curative treatment is available. The 5-year overall survival (OS) rate for patients with metastatic tumors
ranges from 40% to 77%.5-7 It has been suggested that
survival is affected by whether metastasis is identified at
the time of diagnosis of the primary tumor or later in the
disease course,7 but information on this is effect limited.
Treatments for metastatic tumors also are limited and
include radiopharmaceutical agents such as iodine-131
metaiodobenzylguanidine (131I-MIBG) and systemic cytotoxic antineoplastic therapy. The first chemotherapy
reported for metastatic sympathetic paragangliomas was the
alkylating agent cyclophosphamide, which was introduced
in the late 1960s.8 The use of combination antineoplastic
therapy (cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and dacarbazine)
for this disease was first described in 1985.9 Since then, a
few small retrospective studies of chemotherapy for metastatic pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas have been
reported, but no apparent survival benefits from chemotherapy have been observed, perhaps because of the small number of patients available for analysis and the lack of
systematic follow-up.7,10-12 The rarity of these tumors has
made it difficult, if not impossible, to perform randomized,
prospective studies to compare different regimens. The
objective of the current study was to assess the clinical benefits of systemic chemotherapy in a large, single-institution
cohort of patients with metastatic pheochromocytoma or
sympathetic extra-adrenal paraganglioma.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
After obtaining approval from The University of Texas
MD Anderson Cancer Center institutional review board,
we retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 115
patients with metastatic pheochromocytoma or paraganglioma who were diagnosed from January 1979 through
March 2010. We excluded patients with head and neck
paragangliomas because of the differing clinical behavior
of these tumors. Parasympathetic tumors do not secrete
catecholamines like adrenaline and noradrenaline and are
associated infrequently with metastases.13
We created a database using Microsoft SQL Server
(version 2008; Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, Wash) to
include demographic, clinical, laboratory, imaging, pathologic, and outcome treatment information extracted from the

patients’ medical records. Primary tumor location and metastases were verified by pathology, surgical, or radiographic
reports (magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography, fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission
tomography/computerized tomography, or 123I-MIBG scintigraphy). Metastatic disease was defined as the presence of
tumor cells in anatomic sites in which chromaffin tissue is
normally absent (eg, lymph nodes, liver, lung, brain, and
bone). Patients were subdivided into 2 groups: those who
had metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis of the primary
tumor or within 6 months of the primary tumor (synchronous metastases) and those who had metastatic disease identified 6 months after diagnosis (metachronous metastases).
Study Design
Our primary objective was to evaluate the clinical benefits
of systemic chemotherapy for patients with metastatic
pheochromocytomas and sympathetic paragangliomas by
assessing the proportion of patients who experienced
reduced tumor size, as demonstrated by radiographic
studies (eg, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging), and the proportion of patients who experienced normalized blood pressure with a reduction
50% in the initial dosage and number of antihypertensive medications determined by reviewing clinical notes.
Responses were categorized as the best response during
the first chemotherapy regimen.
We calculated OS duration from the date of primary
tumor diagnosis to the date of either death or last followup. Patients were censored at the last follow-up dates if
death did not occur. Because we expected that OS would
be shorter for patients with synchronous metastatic disease than for patients with metachronous metastatic disease, we independently analyzed OS for patients with
synchronous and metachronous metastatic disease. We
compared the OS of patients who experienced a response
with the experience of patients who did not.
Radiographic Tumor Size Evaluation
We reviewed patients’ computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging reports. Response by tumor size
was defined as any objective reduction in the size of the
tumor on cross-sectional imaging studies during the first
chemotherapy regimen.
Blood Pressure and Antihypertensive
Medications
Blood pressure response was defined as blood pressure
normalization after patients’ first chemotherapy regimen

packages SAS version 9.1.3 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary,
NC) and S-plus version 8.0 (TIBCO Software, Inc., Palo
Alto, Calif) were used for the analyses.

Statistical Analyses
Summary statistics, such as the number of nonmissing
observations (N) and the mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum values, were calculated for
continuous variables. Frequencies and percentages were
calculated for categorical variables. Chi-square tests or
Fisher exact tests were used to evaluate the association
between 2 categorical variables, and the Wilcoxon ranksum test was used to compare the distributions of continuous variables between 2 patient groups. The KaplanMeier method was used to estimate OS duration, and the
log-rank test was used to evaluate differences in OS
between patient groups. Landmark analysis was used to
assess the effect of response to chemotherapy on OS,
defining the landmark time as 1 year from the start of
chemotherapy. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards
models were fitted to include important patient clinical
variables. All tests were 2-sided, and P values < .05 were

Patient and Disease Characteristics
Fifty-four patients with progressive metastatic disease
received chemotherapy. Of those 54 patients, 52 patients
had their response status recorded. Their clinicopathologic characteristics are summarized in Table 1. We did
not observe any differences in pretreatment characteristics
between responders and nonresponders.
Nine patients had succinate dehydrogenase complex
gene testing (Table 2). We observed that none of the 4
patients who had mutations on the succinate dehydrogenase subunit B (SDHB) gene (including 1 complete deletion) responded to chemotherapy. One patient with an
SDHC mutation was in the group of responders.
The number of tumor sites was not associated with
response to chemotherapy (Table 1). All patients had normal liver and kidney function test results before they
received chemotherapy (data not shown).

Chemotherapy Response
Twenty-one patients received chemotherapy as initial
treatment (Of these, 2 patients received chemotherapy
with the intention of decreasing the size of the primary
tumor before surgery). For 31 patients, chemotherapy was
used to treat relapsing disease after surgical excision of the
primary tumor. Two patients with unresectable disease
initially received 131I-MIBG, but chemotherapy was initiated 1 year later because of tumor progression.
Front-line chemotherapy regimens were classified as
doxorubicin-based, nondoxorubicin-based, and other
(consisting of platins; cyclophosphamide, hydroxydaunorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone, or prednisolone;
temozolomide; etoposide; imatinib; ifosfamide; and thalidomide). Table 3 lists the front-line regimens used, the
number of responders, the number of cycles, and serious
adverse effects.

Seventeen patients (33%) responded to front-line
chemotherapy, 9 had reduced tumor size, 4 had normalized
blood pressure, and 4 had both. In 2 patients, chemotherapy shrank initially unresectable primary tumors so that the
patient could undergo surgical excision. Thirty-five
patients did not experience a response to chemotherapy.
All 17 patients who experienced a response to chemotherapy had received regimens that included cyclophosphamide and dacarbazine. In addition, doxorubicin had
been included for 12 of 17 patients (71%), and vincristine
had been included for 14 of 17 patients (82%). The dosages of these medications were doxorubicin, 60 to 75 mg/
m2; cyclophosphamide, 600 to 750 mg/m2; dacarbazine
750 to 1000 mg/m2; and vincristine, 1 to 2 mg/m2. The
mean number of cycles of front-line chemotherapy was
6.9. Twelve of 17 patients who responded had skeletal
metastases. Only 2 patients received external-beam radiation therapy before chemotherapy.

Blood Pressure Responses
Thirty-one of 52 patients (59.6%) had clinical evidence
of excessive catecholamine secretion, adrenergic symptoms, and hypertension and had received antihypertensive
medication before chemotherapy. They required a median of 4 different antihypertensive medications (range,
1-7 different antihypertensive medications) to maintain
normal or near-normal blood pressure. The most common antihypertensive medications used were alpha
blockers (phenoxybenzamine, terazosin, doxazosin, and
prazosin), beta blockers (eg, propranolol and metoprolol),
calcium channel blockers (amlodipine, nifedipine, and

nicardipine), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors
(captopril and enalapril), and angiotensin receptor blockers (irbesartan). Others included nitrates, labetalol, hydrochlorothiazide, hydralazine, clonidine, and carvedilol. In
6 of these 31 patients (19.3%), the antihypertensive medication doses and numbers were reduced by >50% after
the first chemotherapy regimen. Three of those 6 patients
had a complete response and discontinued all antihypertensive medications (Table 4).
Patients underwent various measurements of urinary and plasma biochemical markers of catecholamine
excess. Because tests for these markers varied among
patients over time, we could not perform a standardized
analysis. Individual results for patients who experienced a
blood pressure response are listed in Table 4.
Survival
Among the 52 patients who received chemotherapy and
were evaluable for response, the OS rate at 5 years was 51%
(95% confidence interval [CI], 38%-67%). Of the 17
patients who responded to chemotherapy, the median OS
was 6.4 years (95% CI, 5.2-16.4 years), whereas the rate for
nonresponders was 3.7 years (95% CI, 4.0-7.5 years; logrank test from landmark analysis at 1 year after chemotherapy; P ¼ .24). The 30 patients who had synchronous metastatic disease had a median OS of 3.7 years (95% CI, 2.95.1 years), and the 22 patients who had metachronous metastatic disease had a median OS of 9.9 years (95% CI, from
7.5 years to not achieved [NA]; P < .001; log-rank test).
We also analyzed survival according to treatment received
and observed that patients who underwent surgery for their
primary tumor and received chemotherapy had a longer survival compared with the patients who only received chemotherapy (6.5 years vs 3.0 years; P < .001; log-rank test).
Among the 17 patients who experienced a response,
10 had synchronous metastatic disease with a median OS
of 5.6 years (95% CI, from 4.4 years to NA). None of those
patients underwent any surgical resection before starting
chemotherapy. The other 7 responders had metachronous
metastatic disease and a median OS of 7.6 years (95% CI,
from 5.9 years to NA; P ¼ .433; log-rank test). Within the
group of patients who had synchronous metastatic disease,
a positive response status at 1 year after the start of chemotherapy was associated with a trend toward longer survival
(P ¼ .095) (Fig. 1). In addition, when we analyzed the
characteristics of patients who had synchronous metastatic
disease according to their response to chemotherapy, we
discovered that nonresponders had larger tumors than responders (median, 10 cm vs 5.2 cm; P ¼ .022) (Table 5).

2808

We also performed multivariate Cox proportional
hazard model analyses with response status at 1 year of
chemotherapy initiation (yes vs no) and tumor size (fitted
as a continuous variable) as covariates. The effect of
response to chemotherapy at 1 year on OS was significant
(P ¼ .05; hazard ratio, 0.22; 95% CI, 0.05-1.0) with
adjustment for tumor size (P ¼ .77) in the model for
patients who had synchronous metastatic disease.

DISCUSSION
To our knowledge, this is the largest single-institution
review to date of the clinical benefits of systemic chemotherapy for patients with metastatic pheochromocytomas
and sympathetic paragangliomas. In our study, 33% of
patients with metastatic pheochromocytoma or sympathetic paraganglioma experienced improvements in
hypertension and/or tumor size after front-line chemotherapy. The improvement in hypertension was evidenced
by a substantial dosage reduction or discontinuation of
antihypertensive medications. We also observed that the
clinical benefits observed were associated with a trend toward longer survival in responders to chemotherapy who
had synchronous metastatic disease than in nonresponders
who had synchronous metastases. Cyclophosphamide and
dacarbazine combined with vincristine-based and/or doxorubicin-based chemotherapy was the regimen received
by these patients. Forty percent of patients who received
this particular regimen exhibited clinical benefits.
We chose tumor size reduction and/or blood
pressure control as response endpoints in this study. The
diagnosis of pheochromocytoma and sympathetic paragangliomas relies partly on the biochemical demonstration of excessive catecholamines or their metabolites in
the blood and urine.14,15 These biochemical markers are
strongly correlated with tumor size and are the cause of
hypertension observed in these patients.16 Therefore, the
tumor destruction caused by chemotherapy could
decrease catecholamine synthesis and normalize blood
pressure, decreasing the need for antihypertensive medications. Hypertension is an objective, easy-to-measure variable, and it is well recognized that a small reduction in the
blood pressure of hypertensive patients dramatically
reduces cardiovascular complications, thus improving
OS.17,18 Hypertension can be difficult to control in
patients with metastatic pheochromocytomas and sympathetic paragangliomas, and these patients often take
multiple medications. Thus, an improvement in blood
pressure control may be associated with OS improvement

lead to biased and incorrect conclusions.19 For instance,
responders may have had longer survival than nonresponders because of more favorable pretreatment characteristics rather than the therapy itself. To avoid such bias,

Figure 1. Overall survival is illustrated in patients with synchronous metastatic disease who received chemotherapy
(Chemo) among responders and nonresponders 1 year after
the start of chemotherapy. E/N indicates the number of
events/total number of patients.

we compared OS by response to therapy using the landmark method,20 in which a patient’s response is fixed at 1
predetermined time point. Furthermore, when we compared pretreatment characteristics of responders and nonresponders, we did not observe any differences.
Which factors predict response to chemotherapy in
this disease remains unknown. Tumors >5 cm and extraadrenal location have been recognized as clinical predictors of decreased OS in patients with pheochromocytomas
and sympathetic paragangliomas.5 Our univariate analysis
suggested that patients with large primary tumors are less
likely to have a response to chemotherapy. However, in
the multivariate Cox proportional hazards model, the
effect of response at 1 year on OS was independent of
tumor size. In addition, response to chemotherapy did
not correlate with any other factors, particularly primary
tumor location.
Another reported clinical predictor of survival is the
presence of germline mutations of the SDHB gene.21
However, because genetic testing for succinate dehydrogenase germline mutations was not introduced at our
institution until 2005, we identified only 9 patients who
underwent genetic testing. Therefore, we could not determine whether a particular genotype was associated with
better response to chemotherapy. It is noteworthy that
none of the patients who tested positive for SDHB mutations were in the responders group. Nonetheless, future
studies will need to further explore this possibility.
Performance status is a strong predictor of survival
for patients with cancer, but we could not evaluate it in
the current retrospective study. This information should
be used to select patients for systemic therapy, because the

tolerability of a regimen may depend on the individual’s
performance status.
We observed that patients who had synchronous
metastases at diagnosis exhibited a shorter median OS
than patients who had metastatic disease identified later
(metachronous metastases). This contrasts with results
from the most recent study of chemotherapy and pheochromocytomas by Nomura et al,7 in which patients who
had metastases identified at diagnosis had better survival
than those whose metastases were discovered later. However, in other malignancies, poorer survival was reported
when metastatic disease was present at diagnosis than
when it occurred later.22,23
Unfortunately, most patients with metastatic
pheochromocytomas and sympathetic paragangliomas
do not respond to cytotoxic chemotherapy (67% in our
series), and the effect of chemotherapy on OS is small.
Currently, 131I-MIBG remains as the only other nonsurgical treatment that has demonstrated some benefits
in treating symptomatic disease and has produced tumor responses >30%.24,25 However, it has not been
demonstrated that this radiopharmaceutical agent is
effective in tumors that lack MIBG uptake (approximately 30%).26 Furthermore, there is evidence that
some patients with metastases that are avid for I131MIBG often harbor concurrent metastases that are not
avid and may remain undetected even on post-therapy
whole-body scanning after high-dose 131I-MIBG therapy.26 In addition, there are only few specialized centers
in the United States and worldwide that use 131I-MIBG
as a treatment. Therefore, for patients with non-MIBGavid tumors and those with MIBG-avid tumors who do
not response to 131I-MIBG therapy, systemic chemotherapy may be the only therapeutic option.
Recent advances in the study of genetics and molecular pathways have helped elucidate the signal transduction abnormalities that occur in these tumors, and some
of these may serve as targets for new therapies. Moderateto-strong vascular endothelial growth factor receptor
expression and platelet-derived growth factor receptor-b
expression have been reported in malignant pheochromocytomas and sympathetic paragangliomas.21 Thus, a considerable proportion of patients with these tumors may
benefit from therapies that target hypoxia and angiogenic
factors. A few case reports have described clinical benefits
in patients who received sunitinib.27,28
The main limitations of our study are its retrospective design and the lack of a control group. In addition,
most medical records lacked universal descriptions of per-

formance status, such as Karnofsky performance status or
Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group scores, so we could
not asses that factor’s effect on response or OS. Nonetheless, this study has multiple strengths. All pathology specimens and radiologic images were reviewed by specialists
who confirmed the diagnosis. Hypertension and medication changes were well documented by nurses, pharmacists, and physicians. Furthermore, to our knowledge, this
study represents the largest single institutional experience
to date.
In conclusion, pheochromocytomas and sympathetic paragangliomas are rare tumors; therefore, retrospective studies may be the only feasible way to inform
current multidisciplinary treatment strategies. We
observed that combined cyclophosphamide and dacarbazine with vincristine and/or doxorubicin was associated
with blood pressure reduction and longer OS in some
patients. It is our hope that the information presented
here may be useful for developing therapeutic guidelines.
