ABSTRACT
Resveratrol is a polyphenol that has witnessed an unprecedented yearly growth
in PubMed citations since the late 1990s. Based on the diversity of cellular processes
and diseases resveratrol reportedly affects and benefits, it is likely that the interest in
resveratrol will continue, although uncertainty regarding its mechanism in different
biological systems remains.
We hypothesize that insights on disease-modulatory activities of resveratrol
might be gleaned by systematically dissecting the publicly available published data
on chemicals and drugs. In this study, we tested our hypothesis by querying DTome
(Drug-Target Interactome), a web-based tool containing data compiled from opensource databases including DrugBank, PharmGSK, and Protein Interaction Network
Analysis (PINA). Four direct protein targets (DPT) and 219 DPT-associated genes
were identified for resveratrol. The DPT-associated genes were scrutinized by
WebGestalt (WEB-based Gene SeT Analysis Toolkit). This enrichment analysis resulted
in 10 identified KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) pathways. Refined
analysis of KEGG pathways showed that 2 — one linked to p53 and a second to prostate
cancer — have functional connectivity to resveratrol and its four direct protein targets.
These results suggest that a functional activity network (FAN) approach may be
considered as a new paradigm for guiding future studies of resveratrol. FAN analysis
resembles a BioGPS, with capability for mapping a Web-based scientific track that
can productively and cost effectively connect resveratrol to its primary and secondary
target proteins and to its biological functions.

the aging process, pathological inflammation, and ischemic
and chemically induced injuries. Resveratrol-mediated
bioactivities are of significant public health interest;
accordingly, research focus in recent years has been directed
to the understanding of its mechanisms and identification of
its primary (direct) and secondary (indirect) targets [2–11].
What approach is most appropriate and relevant for the
systematic dissection of the rich published research data on
resveratrol to generate insightful, definitive and predictive
leads, and not merely random clues typically associated

INTRODUCTION
Resveratrol is a stilbenoid present abundantly in red
wine, red grape skin, peanuts and several other food items
and drinks consumed daily. Interest in resveratrol increased
greatly following the report by Jang et al. in 1997 showing
that it displays chemopreventive activities as evidenced by
the inhibition of carcinogenesis using in vitro experiments
and animal model studies [1]. Resveratrol has also been
shown to have beneficial effects on coronary heart diseases,

proteins, and genes interact with one another to result in
a physiologic function at the cellular and organ levels.
This higher-order, complex interaction among molecules
can be visualized as a network which typically consists
of nodes representing biological entities (e.g., gene,
protein, disease) and edges representing the relationships
among them (e.g., physical interaction, co-expression
or co-modulation, shared pathway). We first queried
DTome using resveratrol as input. This resulted in output
DB02709 categorizing resveratrol as antioxidants,
platelet aggregation inhibitors, enzyme inhibitors, anticarcinogenic agents, anti-neoplastic agents, phytogenic
and anti-mutagenic agents. Moreover, using the grouping
status of resveratrol as an experimental drug, query of
DTome indicated that it is a chemical investigated for
the treatment of herpes labialis infections (cold sores)
(Table 1). Table 2 presents the 4 primary direct protein
targets (DPT) of resveratrol, respectively, PTGS1,
CSNK2A1, NQO2 and PTGS2. Expanding our search and
analysis using the “Get protein-protein interaction (PPI)
option” in DTome, we identified a total of 219 targetprotein interactions designated DPT-associated genes
as being related to resveratrol and its 4 primary targets
(Appendix 1). The data set obtained was then collectively
integrated for construction of a relevant biological
network using Cytoscape 2.8 [17]. This resulted in the
creation of a resveratrol network and the visualization of
resveratrol target-protein interactions. The 4 primary DPTs
and their secondary DPT-associated proteins, CSNK2A1
(202 PPI), NQO2 (4 PPI), PTGS1 (1 PPI) and PTGS2
(12 PPI), are shown in Figure 1. It should be noted that
except for PTGS1, the other three primary targets show a
direct association with control of tumor suppressor gene
p53 suggesting that a main target pathway under control
or mediated by resveratrol is connected to p53.

with a hit-and-miss strategy? Can this approach also
compare experimental findings from the same or different
laboratories, insofar as the functional interpretation of
changes in large gene sets for possible extrapolation into
common or unique underlying biological themes?
In recent years, the successful launch and
implementation of numerous multi-center genomics studies,
encompassing the use of microarrays, proteomics, and other
high-throughput screening assays often produce hundreds
to thousands of intriguing gene hits which can present
formidable challenges for integration, phenotypically or
thematically. A possible solution to this analytical obstacle
in data mining may lie in the use of the network-based
approach — a simple yet effective method that has found
application in the analysis of massive data obtained from
numerous human disease studies designed to explore and
connect the relationship existing between a drug and its
targets and interacting proteins, for association with disease
[12–15]. DTome is a web-based instrument that allows for
the search and mining of existing drug-target information
[16]. DTome could provide insight and understanding of the
molecular mechanisms of drug action as well as a focused
scope and direction for future research. Whether DTome
can reveal authentic or teaser leads and generate rational,
clinically relevant hypotheses for advancing our knowledge
on chemicals or dietary agents with chemopreventive
potential remains to be established.
In this study, we introduce a FAN analysis capable
of effectively analyzing and prioritizing candidate genes
quickly for linkage to experimentally verifiable grouped
pathways through the deployment of Web-accessible, open
portal databases. As test of principle, we applied DTome
to the widely studied polyphenol resveratrol. We found
that 3 of its 4 identified direct protein targets are linked
to the tumor suppressor gene p53. When the readout
targets and their associated genes were further analyzed
for functionality through pathway enrichment analysis,
the p53 pathway was identified as one of top 10 enriched
KEGG pathways containing 8 resveratrol-associated
genes. We propose that the DTome-directed FAN analysis
is a new paradigm for analyzing resveratrol:p53 interplay;
the flagged genes involved in resveratrol-mediated p53
control can be experimentally verified and new insights
on the biological context of activation/restoration of p53
function by resveratrol might be illuminated. The approach
has implications for understanding the prevention of
cancer by resveratrol and can aid in the treatment of
malignant tumors harboring the dysfunctional p53.

Analysis of functional attributes connected to
resveratrol-mediated changes in gene sets using
WebGestalt
To assess functional features of resveratrolmediated gene sets, we performed the KEGG pathway
enrichment analysis embedded in WebGestalt. The top
10 KEGG pathways linked to resveratrol DPTs and
their DPT-associated genes include pathways in cancer
(31 genes), cell cycle (15 genes), MAPK signaling
(19 genes), Wnt signaling (15 genes), Neurotrophin
signaling (12 genes), adherens junction (10 genes),
prostate cancer (10 genes), p53 signaling (8 genes),
epithelial cell signaling in Helicobacter pylori infection
(8 genes) and melanogenesis (9 genes) (Table 3). All
enriched pathways identified using this approach
represent biological areas that show a statistically
significant association with resveratrol gene sets thus
warranting further investigation. Broad grouping
of the functional analysis suggests that resveratrol
associated genes are mainly linked to cancer-related and

underpinnings, including (i) control of cancer cell
proliferation and survival via MAPK/p53 mediated
cell cycle control, (ii) control of neural or cancer
stem cell development via neurotrophin signaling,
and (iii) regulation of gene transcription by Wnt/bcatenin signaling. Given that 3 of 4 primary targets of
resveratrol have demonstrated a direct association with

the p53 axis (Figure 1), emphasis was directed to the
p53 signaling pathway. Further analyses revealed that
8 genes in the p53 pathway showed a connection to
resveratrol-associated genes, PTEN, TP53, CHEK1,
CDKN1A, BID, CDK1, SFN and IGFBP3 (EntrezGene

Mining genetic alterations connected with
resveratrol-associated genes, PTEN, TP53 and
CDKN1A, in prostate cancer by cBio portal

may be suggested that a functional association exists
between p53 and resveratrol thereby linking DPTs of
resveratrol with p53 control. In addition, the enriched
KEGG pathways derived from resveratrol gene sets also
discovered 10 genes, CREBBP, HSP90B1, CTNNB1,
PTEN, NFKBIA, TP53, HSP90AA1, CDKN1A, RELA
and TCF7L2 (EntrezGene ID: 1387, 7184, 1499, 5728,
4792, 7157, 3320, 1026, 5970 and 6934), all associated
with prostate cancer (Table 3). It is noteworthy that
anti-carcinogenic properties of resveratrol have been
observed in other solid tumors including the highly
fatal pancreatic cancer [18, 19]. Evidence has also been
garnered recently that resveratrol demonstrates efficacy
in the treatment of inflammation-induced pancreatitis
[20, 21].

Although DTome proffers resveratrol as the choice
of treatment for infections (Table 1); the functional
enrichment analysis uncovers the link between resveratrol
associated genes and cancer-related pathways (Table 3).
To further explore the validity of this link, cBio portal,
a web-based integrated data mining system was used to
explore the genetic alteration of genes associated with
resveratrol in prostate cancer. Since the p53 signaling
pathway is a main target of resveratrol, and because 3
overlapping genes (PTEN, TP53 and CDKN1A) were
also found to be associated with prostate cancer by
38673

Oncotarget

KEGG analysis embedded in WebGestalt, we utilized
the 3 indicated overlapping genes identified in both p53
signaling and KEGG pathways to cross check their cancer
genomic alterations and clinical profiles in prostate cancer
(Table 3). A query of 3 selected overlapping genes was
performed. Among 7 prostate cancer studies analyzed
[22–27], alterations ranging from 1.9% to 72.1% were
found for the gene sets/pathways submitted for analysis
(Figure 2A). A summary of the multiple gene alterations
observed across each set of tumor samples from the
Michigan study [24] showing the most pronounced
genomic changes is presented using OncoPrint. The results
show that 44 cases (72%) have an alteration in at least one
of the three genes queried; the frequency of alteration in
each of the selected genes is shown in Figure 2B. No gene

alteration occurred in CDKN1A (Figure 2B). For PTEN,
most alterations are classified as deep deletions with a few
cases of mutations (Figure 2B). Gene changes associated
with TP53 include deep deletions and missense/truncating
mutations (Figure 2B). The alterations in these two genes
tend towards co-occurrence across samples, however,
Mutual Exclusivity analysis showed no statistical
significance (p = 0.183) (data not shown).
cBio portal also provides interactive analysis and
construct networks to view genes that are altered in
cancer. Here, we first show the network to contain all
neighbors of 3 query genes, PTEN, TP53 and CDKN1A
(Figure 3). Next, to reduce the complexity of network
analysis, the genomic alteration frequency within the
selected cancer study was applied as a filter such that

DISCUSSION

only the neighbors with the highest alteration frequency
in addition to our query genes are shown. This refined
analysis generated a different complexity of altered
gene set networks. As a start, the 3 overlapping genes
(PTEN, TP53 and CDKN1A) were identified when
neighbors’ ≥53% alteration was applied as the filter.
Comparatively, 4 genes including androgen receptor
(AR) were evident using a filter of 28% alteration.
A 5 gene cluster with AR and retinoblastoma (RB1)
was observed with a filter incorporating a 27%
alteration, and 6 genes with the addition of AR,
RB1 and YWHAZ (tyrosine 3-monooxygenase/
tryptophan 5-monooxygenase activation protein, zeta)
were revealed when the filter was reduced to 26%
alteration (Figure 3). The full and pruned networks
generated show the potential of complexity as well as
the variability of difference in interactions between
resveratrol associated genes most relevant to the genes
altered in prostate cancer tumor samples from the
Michigan study [24].

Since the landmark finding of the chemoprotective
activity of resveratrol reported by Jang et al. [1]; more
than 7600 publications on resveratrol have appeared on
PubMed to date. A wide range of biological and cellular
activities and multiple targets have been independently
identified for resveratrol illustrating the fascinating
nature of this compound with a plethora of associated
diseases. Still, how resveratrol promotes its wide range
of beneficial effects remains incomplete. As such, new
analytical methods or platforms are needed capable of
bridging resveratrol to its target proteins for linkage to
the observed biological effects. In this study, we introduce
FAN analysis to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of
resveratrol and its association with clinical outcomes in
cancer by using a set of web-based tools. FAN analysis
explores the molecular action of resveratrol by querying
multidimensional cancer genomics data embedded in two
open platforms, DTome [16] and cBio portal [28]. This

workflow combines two simple steps: (i) identify primary
DPTs of resveratrol and functionally integrate with DPTassociated proteins using DTome [16] and (ii) explore and
verify whether genetic alterations exist for the identified
resveratrol-associated genes/proteins across samples in
large-scale cancer genomics projects by cBio portal [28].
The FAN analysis enables researchers to interactively
explore effective targets of resveratrol for connectivity
to information about the biological pathways for all the
genes linked to resveratrol identified DPTs and DPTassociated genes and ultimately to clinical outcomes —
to our knowledge, this is a hitherto unexplored feature
that translates data set from bench to the bedside, with
significant certainty of biological plausibility. Moreover,
FAN analysis also can generate research leads not merely
driven by hypothesis but transcends to ‘rationalized
hypotheses’ where postulates designed to deduce
biological pathways, in terms of gene regulatory networks
or protein-protein interaction networks, are formulated
by mining a single or multiple web-based integrated data
systems. This approach differs significantly from use of
experimental techniques for determining a few interactions
at a time, and takes into account findings from perturbation
studies showing that the suppression of one gene can
cause the activity of numerous other genes to go up or
down as implicated in the existence of a cellular network.
By integrating and utilizing the existing available data
sources, redundant experiments from the same or different
laboratories can be reduced and research direction will be
better guided.
In this paper, we demonstrate the feasibility of FAN
analysis for connectivity between resveratrol and cancer
using DTome (for searching the resveratrol target genes)
combined with cBio portal (for mining alterations of
resveratrol target genes in cancer). Analysis of resveratrol
using these two Web-based resources identified 4
primary DPTs (PTGS1, CSNK2A1, NQO2 and PTGS2)
(Table 2), 219 secondary DPT-associated genes/proteins
(Appendix 1) and 10 enriched KEGG pathways linked
to resveratrol associated genes (Table 3). Based on the
known functional characteristics of 219 DPT-associated
genes and our current knowledge of KEGG pathways, 31
genes may be considered as validated secondary targets of
resveratrol with mechanistic connectivity to cancer (Table
3). We surmise that this diverse range of effects is initiated
by the interplay between resveratrol and its primary DPTs
positioned at the apex of many cellular events. Since 3 of 4
primary targets of resveratrol show direct association with
p53 it is reasonable to suggest that effects of resveratrol are
primarily mediated by the p53 axis (Figure 1). As support,
Gene Set Enrichment analysis independently identifies
the p53 signaling pathway as significantly altered by
resveratrol (Table 3). The association between p53 and
the beneficial effects exerted by resveratrol in cancer were
further explored and evaluated by the genetic alterations
in 3 overlapping genes (PTEN, TP53 and CDKN1A)
revealed by resveratrol associated p53 signaling and
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

prostate cancer pathways (Table 3). Both PTEN and p53
are tumor suppressor genes considered to be among the
most commonly inactivated or mutated in human cancers.
In the case of prostate cancer, most genetic alterations
in PTEN and TP53 are deletions or mutations (Figure
2B), which result in a reduction of their expression in
concordance with the acceleration of carcinogenesis [29,
30]. Studies published by us and others suggest that the
anti-carcinogenic activities of resveratrol are coordinated
with the activation of p53, concomitant with cell cycle
control and induction of apoptosis [31–34]. Thus, results
of FAN analysis are in good agreement with the activation
of p53 by resveratrol as a major driver for the observed
beneficial chemopreventive effects on prostate cancer. It
is worth noting that 70% of men at the time of diagnosis
with prostate cancer are estimated to have lost a copy of
the PTEN gene [35]. Since p53 plays a crucial role in
suppression of PTEN-deficient tumorigenesis via control
of PTEN transcription [35], we propose that activation
of p53 by resveratrol is likely to have chemopreventive
efficacy in patients diagnosed with PTEN-deficient
prostate cancer.
Another aspect of FAN analysis relevant to its utility
and implications for the role resveratrol plays in prostate
cancer relates to the three primary targets of resveratrol:
CSNK2A1, NQO2 and PTGS2 (Table 2). Although they
all show association with control of p53, it is not known
whether they act as sensors, mediators, or capacitors of
resveratrol. We suggest that DTome-flagged NQO2 is
especially worth noting since it was independently purified
and characterized by us as a high affinity resveratrol
target protein (Kdis=35 nM) using affinity chromatography
and X-ray analysis [6]. A hypothesis currently being
considered is that resveratrol acts through NQO2 to
control prostate cancer cell proliferation and survival
via regulated interaction with the p53 signaling axis.
Ongoing studies in our laboratory are directed at charting
the molecular pipeline emanating from resveratrol to
NQO2 (its preferred target), followed by the p53 signaling
network, and ultimately, the pipeline-defined cellular
fate and phenotype. Demonstration of such a molecular
pipeline initiated by resveratrol impinging on the p53 axis
and control of prostate carcinogenesis should illuminate
new biological insights on the control of cancer harboring
dysfunctional p53.
In addition to prostate cancer, numerous studies have
reported on the anti-tumorigenic and chemopreventive
activities of resveratrol in other solid tumors including
skin, breast, lung, colon, liver and pancreatic cancers
[36]. Here, we presented FAN analysis and its utility
to demonstrate the molecular network bridging the
connectivity between resveratrol and its primary targets
as well as resveratrol-associated genes; the functional link
existing between the revealed pathways/network is likely
to be biologically associated with the observed effects
of resveratrol in disease of choice for the analysis, e.g.,
prostate cancer. Whether the connectivity map shown
38676

to exist between resveratrol and prostate cancer in this
work can be extended to other solid tumors remains to
be investigated. In principle, resveratrol-linkage network
revealed by query of DTome could apply to a disease
known to be efficaciously affected by resveratrol,
provided that the inferred resveratrol-disease associations
can be confirmed by disease association analysis in
WebGestalt[16] (Appendix 2) as well as by crossvalidation using disease-specific genetic gene expression
profile studies [37]. Moreover, the FAN analysis could
be further expanded to connect resveratrol-associated
gene sets with cancer-linked, genetic alterations by
mining cancer-specific databases like cBio Portal [21]
and/or Oncomine [38, 39]. In addition, it is possible to
gain insights on the role of resveratrol in the prevention
of treatment of diseases by exploring alterations
connected with resveratrol-associated genes by probing
disease-specific gene expression signatures using data
embedded in the Gene Expression Atlas of ArrayExpress
or OMIN (Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man) — a
comprehensive disease phenotype database of human
genes and gene disorders [37, 40, 41].
Query of publicly available computational and
database tools using the automated FAN analysis approach
may significantly advance (i) understanding of malignant
disease mechanisms, (ii) facilitate early disease diagnosis
and improve the accuracy of disease prognosis, and (iii)
unravel critical roles of resveratrol in human cancers.
This approach is superior to the manual integration of
information on resveratrol and its target genes which can
be challenging, labor-intensive, and error-prone, possibly
because an extremely large amount of heterogeneous
data sources must be considered, tested and assayed.
Comparatively, FAN analysis is completely machinereadable integrated from heterogeneous sources: DTome,
KEGG pathway and cBio portal. FAN analysis can be
used to obtain unified resveratrol-relevant knowledge and
bring insights into the regulation and control of cancer
disease processes. By providing a deeper understanding
of resveratrol’s functions, FAN analysis will also assist
resveratrol bio-curation and new biological experiment
design and could significantly accelerate cancer biology
research. Although generally configured for providing
primary genomic results rather than clinical associations,
FAN analysis is extensible and can be readily generalized
to other biomedical areas. The candidate genes revealed
can facilitate the interpretation of genomic results for noncomputational biomedical researchers and other users.
Lastly, one can surmise that FAN analysis may
find application in the repurposing of drugs. Traditional
drug development faces unique challenges mainly due to
high cost and long duration for approval of use in clinical
settings [42]. Accordingly, repositioning of existing
drugs has taken on increasing appeal and importance as
an alternative approach. Extensive pharmacokinetic and
toxicological data also are available for marketed drugs,
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

thus providing information which may be readily used to
guide and position research, and for comparison of data
generated in studies among laboratories.
Some difficulties remain in applying computational
learning techniques to problems of predicting chemical/
drug response. These challenges are appropriately summed
up in one phrase: the intrinsic variability and difficulty
of reproducibility of biological data. There is significant
inherent nonrepeatability of experimental conditions and/
or biological phenomena. Quality control on the extremely
costly equipment used to make biological measurements
can be a more insidious factor contributing to variability
and lack of repeatability. To some degree, both factors can
be in part counteracted by the FAN analysis.
In summary, as advances in research on resveratrol
using traditional experimental techniques and approaches
continue, more resveratrol targets will unquestionably be
identified; nevertheless, the determination as to whether a
specific biological effect on resveratrol can be definitively
assigned to individual or simultaneous modulation of
its newly or established identified targets can remain
obscure. We believe that some of the uncertainty in
connecting resveratrol to its targets and subsequent
phenotype expression can be offset using FAN analysis,
and that this approach can be used to direct future studies
with reasonable experimental feasibility for testing and
validating rationalized hypotheses regarding the effects of
resveratrol in cancer. For example, a functional network
can be developed based on the core elements of FAN
analysis to further evaluate the impact of resveratrol as
gauged by the changes in altered gene sets shown for a
specific cancer type or cancer in general by expanding the
complicity of cBio portal altered gene network (Figure
3). In addition, drug targets identified and experimentally
verified through FAN analysis can be used for future drug
development. Overall, FAN analysis provides a simple
yet flexible interface to test hypotheses regarding genetic
alterations in cancer by using existing drug information as
a guiding BioGPS to aid researchers in translating basic
research into clinical applications.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Drug-target search
DTome is a web-based bioinformatic tool able to
query the information embedded in three open-source
databases, respectively, DrugBank, PharmGSK, and
PINA; the data compiled are analyzed, grouped, and used
to construct a drug-target interactome [16]. Interaction
networks generated from DTome are integrated into four
types of relationships: drug-drug interactions, drug-target
interactions, drug-gene associations, and target-geneprotein interactions. In this study, DTome was used to
search the interaction between resveratrol and its targets, to
generate a resveratrol-target network. The data were then

REFERENCES

Through use of the DTome search function, drugprotein and second level protein-protein interactions
data were first generated for resveratrol. The data were
integrated into a resveratrol-mediated network and
analyzed using Cytoscape (version 2.8.0) [17]. The
biological information and attribution embedded in
the generated gene set were analyzed using a webbased integrated data mining system, WebGestalt [43,
44]. Biochemical pathways and functions linked to
the resveratrol gene set were specifically queried and
navigated by the KEGG pathway enrichment analysis
tool in WebGestalt [43]. The gene set enrichment
analysis searches for combinations of features that show
a significant difference in means between two classes
that is not an artifact or data noise [45]. Significance in
the identified gene sets is confirmed by replacing chosen
significant features (i.e., gene sets) with other genes
chosen at random, followed by testing and re-analyzing
to see whether the significant difference still persists. The
validated significant gene sets were then organized based
on the KEGG biochemical pathways in a KEGG Table.
Top 10 pathways with an adjusted P-value less than 0.01
were selected.

Exploring cancer genomics data linked to
resveratrol by cBio Cancer Genomics Portal
The cBio Cancer Genomics Portal (http://cbioportal.
org) is an open platform for exploring multidimensional
cancer genomics data by encapsulating molecular profiling
data obtained from cancer tissues and cell lines into readily
understandable genetic, epigenetic, gene expression, and
proteomic events [28]. Complex cancer genomics profiles
can be easily accessed using the query interface of the
portal enabling researchers to explore and compare genetic
alterations across samples. The underlying data thus
obtained can be linked to clinical outcomes to facilitate
novel discovery in biological systems.
In this study, the cBio Portal was used to explore
the connectivity of resveratrol associated genes across all
prostate cancer studies available in the databases. Through
use of the portal search function, resveratrol associated
genes in all samples of prostate cancer studies are
classified as altered or not altered. The genomics datasets
are then presented using OncoPrint as heatmaps — a
visually appealing display of alterations in gene arrays
across tumor samples [46]. Another feature of the portal
is that it can generate multiple visualization platforms by
grouping prostate cancer data alterations using input from
resveratrol gene sets [46–50].
