ABSTRACT
Specificity protein 1 (Sp1) transcription factor (TF) regulates expression of long
non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. RNA interference
(RNAi) studies showed that among several lncRNAs expressed in HepG2, SNU-449 and
SK-Hep-1 cells, highly upregulated in liver cancer (HULC) was regulated not only by Sp1
but also Sp3 and Sp4 in the three cell lines. Knockdown of Sp transcription factors and
HULC by RNAi showed that they play important roles in HCC cell proliferation, survival
and migration. The relative contribution of Sp1, Sp3, Sp4 and HULC on these responses
in HepG2, SNU-449 and SK-Hep-1 cells were cell context- and response-dependent.
In the poorly differentiated SK-Hep-1 cells, knockdown of Sp1 or HULC resulted in
genomic and morphological changes, indicating that Sp1 and Sp1-regulated HULC
are important for maintaining the mesenchymal phenotype in this cell line. Genomic
analysis showed an inverse correlation between expression of genes after knockdown
of HULC and expression of those genes in liver tumors from patients. The antidiabetic
drug metformin down-regulates Sp proteins in pancreatic cancer, and similar results
including decreased HULC expression were observed in HepG2, SNU-449 and SK-Hep-1
cells treated with metformin, indicating that metformin and other antineoplastic agents
that target Sp proteins may have clinical applications for HCC chemotherapy.

the mechanism-based receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK)
inhibitor sorafenib is also effective for treating patients
with advanced HCC [4].
Recent studies show that several long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are overexpressed in HCC
and play important functional roles in liver cancer and
therefore are also potential drug targets [5–16]. Highly
upregulated in liver cancer (HULC) and high expression
in HCC (HEIH) are two lncRNAs overexpressed in
liver tumors. Both HULC and HEIH play a role in the
proliferation of liver cancer cells. HULC is regulated
by HBV X protein (HBX)-dependent activation of
CREB which results in downregulation of the tumor
suppressor gene p18 [7, 8]. The specificity protein 1 (Sp1)

INTRODUCTION
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the
leading causes of cancer deaths worldwide and over
500,000 new cases are diagnosed each year [1–3]. The
incidence of HCC is highest in less developed countries
where there is widespread hepatitis B virus (HBV)
infection. The incidence of HCC in the United States
has tripled over the past two decades and this is due,
in part, to increased infection with hepatitis C virus
(HCV) [1, 2]. Treatment for HCC is dependent on
tumor stage and can include surgical resection, local
ablation by radiofrequency treatment, transarterial
chemobolization and radioembolization (TACE) [2] and

transcription factor regulates expression of HEIH
in HepG2 and Huh7 cells [16], and genetic network
analysis in HCC patients with HBV infection showed
that Sp1 and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor
α regulated pathways are associated with early recurrence
of HCC [17].
Sp1, Sp3 and Sp4 are overexpressed in many
different cancer cell lines [18, 19] and high expression of
Sp1 in tumors is a negative prognostic factor for breast,
pancreatic, gastric, glioma, prostate and lung cancer
patients’ survival [20–26]. The relative expression of Sp
transcription factors in tumors from HCC patients or in
liver cancer cell lines has not been reported; however,
there is indirect evidence that Sp1 and Sp-regulated
genes are negative prognostic factors [16, 27, 28].
Several studies show that antineoplastic agents that
include non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (including
COX-2 inhibitors), metformin, triterpenoids, curcumin
and other natural products as well as ROS-inducing agents
decreased expression of Sp1, Sp3, Sp4 and pro-oncogenic
Sp-regulated genes [18, 29]. In this study, we show
that HULC is an Sp-regulated gene and that the functional
pro-oncogenic activities of HULC and Sp transcription
factors are similar in liver cancer cells. Additionally,
we show that HULC and Sp transcription factors are
downregulated by the antidiabetic drug metformin.

Regulation of HULC by Sp1, Sp3 and Sp4 in
liver cancer cells was investigated by RNAi with
oligonucleotides that targeted the individual Sp
transcription factors. HULC expression in the more
differentiated HepG2 cell was decreased approximately 20
and 40% after transfection of siSp1 and siSp3, respectively,
but minimal effects were observed in cells transfected
with siSp4 (Fig. 2A). In contrast, siSp1, siSp3 and siSp4
significantly decreased expression of HULC (>40–70%)
in SNU-449 (Fig. 2B) and SK-Hep-1 (Fig. 2C) cells.
Knockdown of Sp1, Sp3 and Sp4 in the HCC cell lines
also decreased the protein expression encoded by several
prototypical Sp-regulated genes including BCL-2,
SURVIVIN and EGFR (Suppl. Fig. 1) as previously
reported in other cancer cells [18, 29]. The HULC gene
promoter has GC-rich sequences that bind Sp proteins
(Fig. 2D). ChIP analysis showed that Sp1, Sp3 and Sp4
bound the GC-rich region of the HULC promoter in
HepG2, SNU-449 and SK-Hep-1 cells and the observed
binding was consistent with results showing that Sp
transcription factors regulate HULC expression (Fig. 2C).

Sp proteins and HULC regulate HCC cell
proliferation, survival, migration/invasion
RNAi was also used to investigate the roles of Sp1,
Sp3, Sp4 and HULC in regulating the proliferation and
survival of HCC cells. We focused on HULC rather than
AY12907 since knockdown of this lncRNA had minimal
effects on cell proliferation (data not shown). Transfection
of HepG2 (Fig. 3A), SNU-449 (Fig. 3B) and SK-Hep-1
(Fig. 3C) cells with siSp1, siSp3, siSp4 and siHULC
inhibited HCC cell proliferation and induced apoptosis
(Annexin V staining) and the magnitude of these effects
was cell context-dependent. For example, Sp1 and Sp4
knockdown were the most effective inducers of Annexin V
in SNU-449 and SK-Hep-1 cells, whereas Sp3 and Sp4
were the most active in HepG2 cells and siHULC induced
Annexin V staining in all 3 cell lines. The percentage of
cells with Annexin V staining was greater than 45–80%,
55–90% and 70–90% for HepG2, SNU-449 and SK-Hep-1
cells, respectively.
Using Sp1 knockdown as a model, HCC cells were
transfected with siHULC or siSp1 and their effects on
transwell migration and invasion of the three liver cancer
cell lines were determined (Fig. 4). The results show that
transfection of HepG2 (Fig. 4A), SNU-449 (Fig. 4B)
and SK-Hep-1 (Fig. 4C) cells with siSp1 or siHULC
significantly decreased cell migration in all the cell lines
and decreased SNU-449 and SK-Hep-1 cell invasion in
a Boyden chamber assay (Fig. 4B and 4C); effects were
minimal for HepG2 cells (Fig. 4A) since invasion was
not observed for this cell line. Responses observed in
cells transfected with siSp1 were higher than siHULC,
suggesting more significant contributions from other Spregulated genes.

RESULTS
Sp1, Sp3 and Sp4 transcription factors regulate
HULC and other lncRNAs in HCC cells
The cell lines used in this study included HepG2
(slow growing, well differentiated), SNU-449 (modestly
differentiated), and SK-Hep-1 (poorly differentiated)
cells. Fig. 1A shows that Sp1, Sp3 and Sp4 mRNAs
were expressed in all three cell lines with the highest
levels of Sp1 mRNA in SNU-449 and SK-Hep-1 cells,
and Sp3 and Sp4 mRNAs were more highly expressed in
SNU-449 cells. Western blot analysis confirmed that Sp1,
Sp3 and Sp4 proteins were also highly expressed in the
three HCC cell lines. Using knockdown of Sp1 (siSp1)
by RNA interference (RNAi) as a model, we initially
investigated the effects of loss of Sp1 on expression of
lncRNAs highly expressed in HCC cells, namely HULC,
lncRNA-HEIH, AY129027, DQ786243 and HOTAIR [5]
(Fig. 1C). Knockdown of Sp1 downregulated AY12907
in all three cell lines, and lncRNA DQ786243 was
increasingly upregulated in the less differentiated cell
lines. LncRNA-HEIH and HOTAIR were downregulated
upon Sp1 knockdown in SNU-449 and SK-Hep-1 cells
but their expression did not change in HepG2 cells.
Interestingly, HULC was significantly and consistently
downregulated upon Sp1 knockdown in all three HCC cell
lines, suggesting that HULC is a Sp-regulated lncRNA in
HCC cells.

SK-Hep-1 cells as a model. Transfection of these cells
with siHULC changed cell morphology, slightly increased
E-cadherin mRNA and protein, and decreased expression
of vimentin mRNA and protein (Fig. 5B–5D). Knockdown
of Sp1 in SK-Hep-1 cells also changed cell morphology
and had minimal effects on E-cadherin mRNA and protein
but significantly decreased vimentin (mRNA and protein)
(Fig. 5E–5G). Cell morphology in SK-Hep-1 cells after
loss of HULC or Sp1 was more typical of epithelial cells,
indicating that Sp1 and HULC played a critical role in
maintaining the mesenchymal phenotype.

knockdown were compared to the profiles of human liver
tumors vs. normal liver in the NextBio database. Out
of the total of 56 comparisons, all but three exhibited
negative correlation to the HULC-regulated genes, i.e.,
those genes down-regulated by HULC knockdown were
up-regulated in the liver tumors and those genes up-regulated
by HULC knockdown were down-regulated in the tumors
(Fig. 6D). More than half of these biosets (39 out of 56)
exhibited statistically significant negative correlation
to the HULC-regulated genes (alpha = 0.05 with a
Benjamini-Hochberg multiple test correction).

Metformin decreases expression of Sp
transcription factors and HULC

HULC-regulated gene expression in cells
and correlation with genes overexpressed in
liver tumors

The antidiabetic drug metformin [33] decreases
expression of Sp1, Sp3, Sp4 and Sp-regulated genes in
pancreatic cancer cells [18] and metformin (0–20 mM)
inhibited growth of HepG2, SNU-449 and SK-Hep-1
cells after treatment for 24 and 48 hr (Fig. 7A). Metformin
also decreased expression of Sp1, Sp3 (high molecular
weight), and Sp4 in HepG2 cells after treatment for 24 hr;
however, the lower molecular weight Sp3 band was not
affected, whereas in SNU-449 cells, the higher molecular
weight Sp3 band was only slightly decreased (Fig. 7B). In
contrast, Sp1, Sp3 (high and low molecular weight), and
Sp4 were decreased in the less differentiated SK-Hep-1
cells after treatment with metformin for 24 hr (Fig. 7B) and
after treatment for 48 hr, all the Sp transcription factors
were decreased in the three cell lines (data not shown).
Metformin also decreased expression of HULC in HepG2,
SNU-449 and SK-Hep-1 cells (Fig. 7C), demonstrating
that drugs targeting Sp transcription factors also target
Sp-regulated lncRNAs in HCC cells. Metformin treatment
represents a novel mechanistic approach for treating
HCC patients that overexpress Sp transcription factors
and HULC.

Illumina human V.3 HT12 beadchip arrays were
used to examine effects of transfection with siHULC on
changes in gene expression in SK-Hep-1 cells. HULC
knockdown resulted in the increase and decrease of 135
and 215 genes, respectively (Fig. 6A). Gene ontology
analysis showed that HULC regulates expression of
genes associated with cell growth/cell cycle expression,
apoptosis, migration and several other functions. Many
lncRNAs interact with chromatin modifying complexes
to regulate gene expression and since mixed linkage
leukemia 1 (MLL1) and enhancer of zeste homology
2 (EZH2) are both involved in hepatocarcinogenesis
[31, 32] and also components of chromatin-modifying
complexes, we compared the overlap of genes in
SK-Hep-1 cells transfected with siHULC with siMLL1
and siEZH2. Fig. 6B illustrates the number of common
genes coregulated by HULC/MLL1 and HULC/EZH2
after knockdown experiments (siHULC, siMLL1 and
siEZH2) in SK-Hep-1 cells. The overlap in HULC/EZH2
coregulated genes was minimal, whereas HULC/MLL1
coregulated 32 and 57 common genes thatwere down- and
upregulated, respectively (Fig. 6B) (Supplemental Table 1).
Real time PCR was used in a separate experiment to
demonstrate that individual knockdown of siHULC or
siMLL1 decreased expression of RRM2, SKP2 and
STM1 in SK-Hep-1 cells (Fig. 6C) and this pattern was
also observed in the array data (Supplemental Table 2).
The TGFBR2 and ITBG1 genes were decreased only by
siHULC and this also corresponded to the array data.
However, knockdown of MLL1 increased TGFBR2
and ITGB1 gene expression, suggesting that MLL-1
regulation of these genes may be indirect and do not
involve coregulation by the MLL-1/HULC complex.
Given that knockdown of HULC expression negatively
affected the growth and survival of hepatocellular
carcinoma cell lines (Fig. 3), we hypothesized that the
expression of HULC-regulated genes would negatively
correlate with expression of those genes in liver cancer.

DISCUSSION
Sp transcription factors are overexpressed in
multiple tumors and cancer cell lines and there is evidence
that Sp1 is a negative prognostic factor for patients with
several different cancers including HCC [20–26]. Sp
transcription factors are not only negative prognostic
factors for patient survival but also exhibit pro-oncogenic
functional activity as determined by knockdown studies in
several cancer cell lines [18, 29]. For example, loss of Sp1
in fibromyosarcomas, gliomas, multiple myeloma, lung,
pancreatic and colon cancer cells, and rhabdomyosarcomas
results in one or more of inhibition of growth, cell cycle
progression, survival, migration and invasion [29, 33–43].
The effects resulting from Sp1 knockdown are consistent
with the parallel decrease in pro-oncogenic Sp-regulated
genes associated with cancer cell survival (bcl-2, survivin),
proliferation (EGFR, c-MET, cyclin D1), angiogenesis

(VEGF and VEGFR1), inflammation (p65NFκB), and
invasion (CXCR4 and MMP9) [18]. Sp3 and Sp4 regulate
many of the same functions and genes described for Sp1;
however, the role of Sp1, Sp3 and Sp4 are both gene- and
cell context-specific.
In this study, we show that Sp1, Sp3 and
Sp4 mRNA and protein are highly expressed
in HepG2, SK-Hep-1 and SNU-449 HCC cell lines
(Fig. 1A and 1B). It was previously reported that
expression of lncRNA-HEIH was decreased after
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

knockdown of Sp1 by RNAi in HepG2 and Huh7 cells [16]
and therefore, we initially used RNAi to investigate the
role of Sp1 in regulating a panel of lncRNAs identified in
HCC cell lines. Surprisingly, we did not observe decreased
expression of lncRNA-HEIH as previously reported
[16] and this may be due to a temporal effect which is
currently being investigated. Decreased expression of
Sp1 differentially modulated expression of the lncRNAs
in HepG2, SNU-449 and SK-Hep-1 cells and HULC was
one of only two lncRNAs that were Sp1-regulated in all
26368

Oncotarget

three cell lines (Fig. 1C). Moreover, we also observed that
knockdown of Sp1 and Sp3 decreased HULC expression
in HepG2, SNU-449 and SK-Hep-1 cells and siSp4
decreased HULC in the latter two cell lines (Fig. 2). Sp1,
Sp3 and Sp4 also interacted with the GC-rich HULC
promoter in HepG2, SNU-449 and SK-Hep-1 cells
(Fig. 2D), further demonstrating a role for Sp transcription
factors in regulating this lncRNA. Previous studies
showed that PKA and CREB upregulate HULC expression
and that insulin-like growth factor mRNA binding protein
1 (IGF2BP1) destabilizes HULC [9], whereas our results
demonstrate that Sp transcription factors are important for
basal expression of HULC in HCC cells.
Sp transcription factors play a role in the
proliferation, survival, migration/invasion of several
cancer cell lines [18] and we used RNAi to investigate
the differential effects of Sp1, Sp3, Sp4 and HULC
knockdown on HCC cell proliferation and survival.
Loss of the transcription factors and HULC individually
decreased cell proliferation and induced apoptosis in all
three cell lines and SNU-449 and SK-Hep-1 cells were
more sensitive than the more highly differentiated HepG2
cells. Knockdown of Sp1 and HULC also decreased
migration and invasion of HCC cells (Fig. 4) and partially
reversed the mesenchymal phenotype of SK-Hep-1 cells
in which the mesenchymal marker vimentin was decreased
(Fig. 5). We also further characterized the role of HULC
in liver cancer by examining the modulation of gene
expression after knockdown of HULC or knockdown
of two important components of chromatin-modifying
complexes (MLL1 and EZH2) (Fig. 6). Analysis of
array data demonstrated the multifunctional roles of
HULC which correlated with the functional effects of
knockdown of HULC. Coregulation of genes by HULC
and EZH2 or HULC and MLL1 was limited (Fig. 6C);
however, there was significant negative correlation
between HULC-regulated genes in SK-Hep-1 cells with
genes regulated in hepatocellular carcinomas (Fig. 6D).
Currently, we are further investigating diagnostic genes
overexpressed in tumors and their coregulation by
HULC and Sp transcription factors and other chromatin
modifying complexes.
Results of this study demonstrate the importance
of HULC and Sp transcription factors in HCC,
suggesting that both HULC and Sp1 can be targeted
by anticancer agents that are known to downregulate
Sp transcription factors in other cancer cell lines and
tumors [18, 35–40, 43]. Metformin is an antidiabetic
drug that protects patients against pancreatic cancer
and metformin downregulates Sp1, Sp3, Sp4 and prooncogenic Sp-regulated genes in pancreatic cancer cells
and tumors [33]. Metformin also protects diabetic patients
from development of HCC, and metformin regulated
genes/pathways in HCC cell lines are similar to those
reported in pancreatic and other cancer cell lines [44–47].
In this study, we show that metformin inhibits growth of
HepG2, SNU-449 and SK-Hep-1 cells, and the growth
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

inhibition is accompanied by downregulation of Sp
transcription factors and Sp-regulated HULC expression
(Fig. 7). Thus, the antineoplastic effects of metformin are
due, in part, to downregulation of Sp proteins and HULC
and we are currently investigating other Sp-regulated
pathways in HCC cells that contribute to this response.
In summary, this study demonstrates that Sp1 and
other Sp transcription factors are important for liver
cancer cell growth, migration, survival, invasion and
epithelial-mesenchymal-transition, and we demonstrate
that HULC and other lncRNAs are Sp-regulated genes in
HCC. Thus, drugs such as metformin that downregulate Sp
transcription factors and Sp-regulated genes (e.g. HULC)
may be clinically useful in drug combinations for treating
HCC patients that overexpress Sp transcription factors.
Moreover, serum levels of HULC [6, 10] may be a marker
of treatment efficacy.

expression according to the manufacturer’s protocol
and microarray data were normalized using the
quantile normalization method in the Linear Models for
Microarray Data (LIMMA) package in the R language
(http://www.r-project.org). Differentially expressed
genes were identified using a > 1.5-fold change cut off.
Gene ontology enrichment analysis was carried out using
David Functional Annotation Resources 6.7 (http://david.
abcc.ncifcrf.gov/). A rank-based nonparametric analysis
strategy called the Running Fisher’s algorithm and
implemented within the NextBio database (http://www.
nextbio.com/) environment was used to identify gene
expression comparisons (biosets) which have statistically
significant positive or negative correlation to the genes
regulated by siHULC in SK-Hep-1 cells. The Running
Fisher’s algorithm computes statistical significance of
similarity between ranked fold-change values of two gene
lists [48]. After exporting the analysis, the list of correlated
biosets were filtered to identify those that examined gene
expression changes in liver tumors.
