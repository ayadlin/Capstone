SUMMARY
Patients with germline fumarate hydratase (FH) mutation are predisposed to develop aggressive
kidney cancer with few treatment options and poor therapeutic outcomes. Activity of the protooncogene ABL1 is upregulated in FH-deficient kidney tumors and drives a metabolic and survival
signaling network necessary to cope with impaired mitochondrial function and abnormal
accumulation of intracellular fumarate. Excess fumarate indirectly stimulates ABL1 activity while
restoration of wild-type FH abrogates both ABL1 activation and the cytotoxicity caused by ABL1
inhibition or knockdown. ABL1 upregulates aerobic glycolysis via the mTOR/HIF1α pathway and
neutralizes fumarate-induced proteotoxic stress by promoting nuclear localization of the antioxidant response transcription factor NRF2. Our findings identify ABL1 as a pharmacologically
tractable therapeutic target in glycolytically dependent, oxidatively stressed tumors.

INTRODUCTION

Author Manuscript

Cancers that depend on altered metabolic programs and on up-regulated stress response
pathways need to cope with the consequences of deregulated metabolism. Utilizing
genetically defined cancers with well-characterized metabolic adaptations provides a unique
opportunity to identify mechanism-based therapeutic interventions. Hereditary kidney
cancers provide models that are particularly well-suited for this purpose, as two types of
kidney cancer are characterized by mutation of the TCA cycle genes, fumarate hydratase
(FH) and succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), respectively. Inactivation of either enzyme
disrupts mitochondrial respiration and promotes dependence on aerobic glycolysis, a
characteristic of aggressive kidney cancer (Linehan and Rouault, 2013; The Cancer Genome
Atlas Research Network, 2013). Mutations in FH are found in the germline of patients with
hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell carcinoma (HLRCC), a hereditary cancer
syndrome in which affected individuals are at risk for developing cutaneous and uterine
leiomyomas and a highly aggressive form of type 2 papillary kidney cancer (Grubb, III et
al., 2007). No effective form of therapy is currently available for patients with advanced FHdeficient kidney cancer.

FH-deficient kidney cancers and their cell line models are highly glycolytic and display
increased glucose dependence, lactate production, elevated levels of the hypoxia-stimulated
transcription factor HIF1α and decreased activity of AMP-activated kinase (AMPK) (Yang
et al., 2010; Tong et al., 2011; Yang et al., 2012). This metabolic adaptation is, at least in
part, a direct consequence of the intracellular accumulation of the oncometabolite, fumarate
(Isaacs et al., 2005; Frezza et al., 2011; Tong et al., 2011). By inhibiting HIF prolyl
hydroxylase, fumarate stabilizes HIF1α which leads to the transcription of multiple genes,
including those that encode for glucose transporters 1 and 4 (Glut1, Glut4), and vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF).

Author Manuscript

Although HIF1α transcriptional activity and expression is increased in HLRCC tumors
(Koivunen et al., 2007; Isaacs et al., 2005), their high energetic demands and increased
glycolytic activity cause redox homeostasis to become unbalanced due to elevated
production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (Sudarshan et al., 2009; Sullivan et al., 2013).
To survive this proteotoxic stress, FH-deficient kidney cancer cells utilize the oxidative
branch of the pentose phosphate pathway to drive NADPH production and glutathione
synthesis (Yang et al., 2013). Excess fumarate also stabilizes the master regulator of the
antioxidant response, the transcription factor nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2
(NFE2L2 or NRF2) (Ooi et al., 2011; Adam et al., 2011). NRF2 activation in cancer has
been reported to be either beneficial or detrimental, depending on the context and/or the
tumor type (Sporn and Liby, 2012). In HLRCC tumors, NRF2 activation appears to be
critical for tumor growth and survival (Frezza et al., 2011; Ooi et al., 2011; Adam et al.,
2011).
Although FH mutation has been reported almost solely in HLRCC cancers, reduced FH
activity has been found in other cancers, including clear cell kidney cancer (Sudarshan et al.,
2011), and induction of pseudo-hypoxia and deregulated redox homeostasis are common
features of many aggressive epithelial cancers (Denko, 2008; Cairns et al., 2011). While

several studies have identified components of these pathways as potential molecular targets
in FH-deficient tumors (Xie et al., 2009; Sourbier et al., 2010; Frezza et al., 2011),
identification of a clinically tractable therapy for HLRCC cancer patients remains an unmet
need. In the current study, we used an unbiased drug screen to identify therapeutic strategies
targeting the deregulated metabolism and upregulated stress response pathways of HLRCC
cancer.

RESULTS
Drug screening identifies vandetanib as highly cytotoxic for FH-deficient HLRCC kidney
cancer cells

Author Manuscript

In order to uncover therapeutic strategies for patients with highly aggressive HLRCCassociated kidney cancer, we utilized the HLRCC-derived UOK262 cell line cultured in
pyruvate-free media to screen a panel of 17 agents targeting diverse signaling pathways
(Table S1). The tyrosine kinase inhibitor vandetanib (IC50 = 16 nM) proved to be by far the
most potent compound tested. Vandetanib displayed synthetic lethality for FH-deficient
cells; stable reintroduction of wild-type FH into two independently derived HLRCC cell
lines (UOK262 and UOK268) abrogated its cytotoxicity (Figure 1A).

Author Manuscript

We reported previously that HIF1α expression is necessary to maintain the invasive
phenotype of HLRCC cells (Tong et al., 2011). Vandetanib fully inhibited the invasiveness
of UOK262 cells (Figure 1B, Figure S1A) and markedly decreased their HIF1α protein
expression to levels comparable to those seen in wild-type FH-restored cells (Figure 1C),
but its mechanism of action involved neither protein degradation nor modulation of HIF1α
mRNA levels (Figure S1B-C). These data suggested that vandetanib may affect HIF1α
translation, a process regulated by the protein kinase mTOR (Powis and Kirkpatrick, 2004).
Indeed, we found that steady-state phosphorylation of mTOR and its downstream target S6
kinase, were markedly decreased following vandetanib treatment (Figure 1D).

Author Manuscript

Since ABL1 is reported to regulate mTOR (Cilloni and Saglio, 2012; Kim et al., 2005;
Markova et al., 2010) and vandetanib potently inhibits ABL1 in vitro (Davis et al., 2011;
Karaman et al., 2008), we asked whether vandetanib-mediated inhibition of the mTOR/
HIF1α pathway might be phenocopied by ABL1 knockdown. Using UOK262 cells in which
ABL1 was silenced with siRNA, we confirmed that reduced expression of ABL1, like
vandetanib treatment, inhibited HIF1α expression and mTOR activity (Figure 1C-D, Figure
S1D). Next, we confirmed that vandetanib and the ABL1 inhibitor imatinib inhibited the in
vitro kinase activity of endogenous ABL1 that was immunopurified from both FH-deficient
renal cell carcinoma cell lines (UOK262 and UOK268), as well as the activity of purified
ABL1 protein (Figure 1E and 1F, respectively). These data were confirmed by assessing the
phosphorylation status of CRKII, a substrate of ABL1 (Figure 1D), and by determining the
phosphorylation status of ABL1 immunopurified from UOK262 and UOK268 cell lines
previously treated for 4 hours with vandetanib (Figure 1G). Further, ABL1-specific siRNA
reduced HIF1α expression in two HLRCC-derived cell lines to levels comparable to those
achieved with vandetanib treatment or by restoration of wild-type FH (Figure 1C). Finally,
nilotinib and ponatinib, two structurally distinct ABL1 inhibitors were equipotent with
vandetanib in inhibiting the growth of UOK262 cells and their toxicity was markedly

ameliorated by restoration of wild-type FH (Figure S1E). Notably, the growth inhibitory
activity of these ABL1 inhibitors was reduced in medium containing pyruvate (Figure S1F).
Finally, using an in vitro kinase assay, we found that these three TKIs displayed similar
potency in inhibiting the activity of purified ABL1 (vandetanib IC50 = 15 nM, nilotinib IC50
= 4 nM, ponatinib IC50 = 17 nM; Figure S1G), consistent with our hypothesis that ABL1
may be an important target in FH-deficient tumor cells. However, we cannot exclude the
possibility that an off-target effect of vandetanib may fortuitously contribute to its activity in
this tumor model.
ABL1: a therapeutic target in FH-deficient tumor cells

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

The Abelson (ABL) family of nonreceptor tyrosine kinases, comprised of ABL1 and ABL2,
affects diverse signaling pathways involved in cell growth, invasion and migration.
Activation of ABL1 and ABL2 have been detected in a number of different cancers
(Greuber et al., 2013). Although the role of oncogenic BCR-ABL fusion protein has been
extensively studied in hematologic malignancies (Cilloni and Saglio, 2012), much less is
known about the physiological and/or pathological role of wild-type ABL1. Based on the
preceding data, we immunoprecipitated ABL1 from protein lysates of 5 HLRCC tumors
surgically removed from 3 patients, as well as from lysates of normal tissues, and we
compared ABL1 phosphorylation normalized to total immunoprecipitated ABL1 protein as
an indicator of its activation state (Figure 2A). The ABL1 activation state in 5 of 5 tumor
specimens was significantly greater than that in the normal tissues. We performed a similar
comparison in 2 HLRCC-derived cell lines and in their wild-type FH-restored counterparts
(Figure 2B). Constitutive ABL1 phosphorylation, while clearly evident in both HLRCCderived cell lines, was markedly reduced upon restoration of wild-type FH (total and
phospho-ABL1 levels in HEK293 kidney cells are included for comparison), although this
did not affect the expression of total ABL1 protein. We also assessed the phosphorylation
status of ABL1 in skin and uterine leiomyomas, two classical manifestations of HLRCC
disease, compared with their normal counterparts (Figure S2A-B). ABL1 phosphorylation
was elevated in skin leiomyomas but not in uterine leiomyomas, suggesting that treatment of
these manifestations might require alternative targeting approaches.

Author Manuscript

Given these findings, we investigated next whether the cytotoxicity of vandetanib in FHdeficient tumor cells was ABL1-dependent. Classical rescue experiments were performed
following ABL1 knockdown in UOK262 cells by lentiviral infection of microRNA
(miRNA) targeting human ABL1 (miABL1; a scrambled miRNA, miSCR, was used as an
miRNA control) (Yogalingam and Pendergast, 2008). Various lentiviral murine ABL
constructs, not recognized by miABL1, were then infected and their ability to rescue
endogenous ABL1 knockdown or its pharmacologic inhibition was examined. These
constructs included wild-type ABL1 (WT), kinase-dead ABL1 (K290M), tyrosine kinase
inhibitor (TKI) resistant ABL1 (T315I) and constitutively active ABL1 (P131L) (Figure 2CD) (Smith-Pearson et al., 2010; Yogalingam and Pendergast, 2008). Infection with empty
pBABE plasmid (‘BABE’) served as a control. Using purified proteins in an in vitro kinase
assay, we confirmed that ABL1-T315I was resistant to vandetanib (Figure S2C).
Knockdown of endogenous ABL1 upon infection with miRNA significantly decreased cell
viability (approximately 50%) at 24 hr, while simultaneous expression of WT, T315I and

P131L murine ABL proteins restored cell viability to control (or miSCR-infected) levels
(Figure 2C). In contrast, kinase-dead ABL1 expression did not restore cell viability,
supporting the ABL dependence of this phenotype. Importantly, vandetanib did not cause
additional toxicity in miABL1-treated cells expressing either empty plasmid, kinase-dead
ABL1, TKI-resistant ABL1, or constitutively active ABL1. However, vandetanib produced
significant cytotoxicity in cells infected with miSCR, and in cells infected with both
miABL1 and wild-type murine ABL1. Consistent with these data, the silencing of
endogenous ABL1 in UOK262 cells with two distinct siRNAs dramatically decreased cell
viability in the absence of vandetanib (Figure 2E). Finally, like vandetanib cytotoxicity, the
cytotoxicity incurred by ABL1 knockdown was abrogated by restoration of wild-type FH in
UOK262 cells (Figure S2D-E). In both UOK262 and HEK293 cells, ABL1 knockdown
upon miABL1 infection markedly reduced mTOR phosphorylation. Re-expression of wildtype, TKI-resistant or constitutively active ABL1, but not kinase-dead ABL1 was able to
rescue this phenotype (Figure 2D and Figure S2F). Importantly, the infected murine ABL1
proteins were expressed at levels similar to endogenous ABL1 in both cell lines.
To assess the importance of ABL1 in maintaining the tumorigenic phenotype of FHdeficient cells, we measured their anchorage-independent growth and invasiveness after
ABL1 inhibition or silencing. These data show that ABL1 expression and activity are
necessary to sustain the clonogenicity and invasive potential of FH-deficient tumor cells
(Figure 2F, Figure S1A).
ABL1 promotes aerobic glycolysis

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Based on our data linking ABL1 with HIF1α expression (Figure 1C), we investigated
whether ABL1 inhibition affected the aerobic glycolysis on which FH-deficient cells depend
for generation of ATP and cellular building blocks (Yang et al., 2010; Tong et al., 2011).
First, we found that vandetanib significantly decreased expression of the glucose
transporters Glut1 and Glut4 in UOK262 cells (Figure 3A), concomitant with decreased
glucose uptake and lactate secretion (Figure 3B and 3C, respectively). Transient silencing of
ABL1 or HIF1α decreased glucose uptake to a similar degree (Figure 3B, Figure S3A). To
confirm that ABL1 promotes aerobic glycolysis, we assessed the impact of ABL1
modulation on the extracellular acidification rate (ECAR, a surrogate for lactate secretion).
In agreement with our earlier results, silencing or pharmacologic inhibition of ABL1
significantly decreased ECAR in UOK262 cells (Figure 3D). Consistent with a relationship
between ABL1 activity and glycolysis, vandetanib concomitantly inhibited both ABL1
activity (steady-state ABL1 phosphorylation) and glucose uptake in UOK150, a glycolytic
clear cell kidney cancer cell line established from a non-HLRCC kidney cancer harboring an
inactivating VHL mutation (Sourbier et al., 2012) (Figure S3B-C).
Vandetanib inhibits ABL1, glycolysis and HLRCC tumor growth in vivo
In order to visualize the dynamic impact of vandetanib on HLRCC metabolism in vivo, we
used magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) to monitor the metabolism of
intravenously injected hyperpolarized [1-13C] pyruvate, as previously described (Golman et
al., 2006; Chen et al., 2007). MRSI detects increased conversion of pyruvate to lactate in
tumors, most notably in those characterized by a high rate of glycolysis and impaired

oxidative phosphorylation. As shown in Figure 4A, in vivo imaging of untreated UOK262
xenografts (day 0) revealed a high lactate/pyruvate ratio, whereas vandetanib treatment (day
2) significantly suppressed the conversion of pyruvate to lactate in tumors without affecting
tumor perfusion (Figure 4A-B), suggesting that, in agreement with ourin vitro data,
vandetanib inhibits tumor glycolysis in vivo.

Author Manuscript

Next, we assessed the antitumor efficacy of vandetanib in the same HLRCC murine
xenograft model. As shown in Figure 4C, vandetanib (100 mg/kg, once weekly, i.p.) caused
marked tumor regression in 80% (12 of 15, two independent experiments) of treated mice.
When we interrogated the molecular effects of vandetanib in vivo, we found that the
activation status of ABL1 was significantly reduced after 2 days in tumors excised from
vandetanib-treated mice compared with vehicle-treated animals (Figure 4D), as well as after
10 weeks of treatment (Figure S4B). Also, similar to earlier in vitro observations, activity of
the mTOR/HIF1α pathway in these tumors (including HIF1α expression, Glut1 expression,
VEGF-A level in tumor tissue and in plasma, and phospho-S6K) was decreased in
vandetanib-treated mice after 2 days (Figure S4A) as well as after 10 weeks of treatment
(Figure S4C-F). After 10 weeks of treatment, tumors from vandetanib-treated mice were
also more apoptotic and displayed less activation of EGFR family and VEGF receptor
kinases compared with tumors excised from vehicle-treated animals (Figure S4G-H).
Fumarate-mediated ABL1 activation upregulates NRF2 nuclear localization and
transcriptional activity in vitro and in vivo

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

The constitutively elevated level of phosphorylated ABL1 in HLRCC cell lines is reversed
by restoration of wild-type FH expression (see Figure 2B), and the in vitro kinase activity of
ABL1 immunopurified from HLRCC cells is significantly greater than that of the kinase
immunopurified from FH-restored HLRCC cells (Figure 5A). Therefore, we examined
whether intracellular accumulation of fumarate influenced ABL1 kinase activity, either
directly or indirectly. We observed that treatment of cells expressing functional FH protein
(HEK293 or UOK262WT) with a cell-permeable form of fumarate (dimethylfumarate,
DMF) resulted in increased ABL1 phosphorylation (Figure 5B). However, neither fumarate
nor DMF were able to directly stimulate ABL1 in vitro, suggesting that fumarate-mediated
ABL1 activation in cells is indirect (Figure S5A). Since ABL1 is activated by oxidative
stress and excess intracellular fumarate increases ROS (Sudarshan et al., 2009; Sullivan et
al., 2013), fumarate-induced ABL1 activation may be ROS-dependent. Consistent with this
model, treatment of UOK262 cells with the ROS scavenger N-acetylcysteine (NAC)
concurrently reduced both steady-state ABL1 phosphorylation and cellular ROS level
(Figure S5B-C). However, we cannot exclude the possibility that additional factors may
contribute to the increased activation state of ABL1 in these tumor cells.
Accumulation of intracellular fumarate has been shown to stabilize expression of the
antioxidant response transcription factor NRF2 via inactivation of its endogenous inhibitor
KEAP1 (Adam et al., 2011; Ooi et al., 2011). Since the Src kinase family is reported to
modulate NRF2 nuclear translocation (Jain and Jaiswal, 2006; Shelton and Jaiswal, 2013),
we examined whether vandetanib affects this process in FH-deficient tumor cells. By
evaluating nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions prepared from drug-treated and control cells

for NRF2 content, we observed that vandetanib caused a time-dependent redistribution of
NRF2 from nucleus to cytosol that was complete within 6 hours (Figure 5C). These data
were further confirmed by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy performed 6 hours
after vandetanib (20 nM) treatment (Figure 5D-E). Redistribution of NRF2 from nucleus to
cytosol should result in decreased transcriptional activity. Using a luciferase-based NRF2
reporter assay, we found that DMF stimulated, while vandetanib inhibited NRF2
transcriptional activity (Figure 5F). Importantly, NAC treatment that reduced ROS level and
ABL1 activity (see Figure S5B, C) also caused a significant reduction in DMF-stimulated
NRF2 transcriptional activity (Figure S5D). Using the same assay we confirmed that
silencing of ABL1 abrogated DMF-induced NRF2 transcriptional activity (Figure 5G).
Taken together, these data support a role for ABL1 in supporting NRF2-mediated
transcription in response to elevated intracellular fumarate levels, and for ROS in mediating
the fumarate-dependent increase in NRF2 activity.

Author Manuscript

HLRCC tumor cells constitutively express high levels of ROS, and ROS-inducing agents are
particularly cytotoxic to these cells (Sourbier et al., 2010). Because NRF2 plays a critical
role in cellular defense against ROS (Sporn and Liby, 2012), we tested whether the
vandetanib sensitivity of these cells might be affected by cellular ROS level. We pretreated
UOK262 cells with NAC for 2 hr prior to treatment with vandetanib for an additional 16 hr.
NAC pre-treatment, did not itself affect cell viability, but it significantly protected the cells
from vandetanib toxicity (Figure S5E). Notably, the growth inhibitory activity of ABL1targeting TKIs is also markedly compromised by cell culture in pyruvate-containing medium
(Figure S1F), and several reports identify pyruvate as a ROS scavenger (Sudarshan et al.,
2009; Babich et al., 2009). Consistent with these findings, cell culture in pyruvatecontaining medium significantly reduced DMF-induced NRF2 activity (data not shown).

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Since ABL1 also promotes HIF1α-mediated glycolysis (vide supra), we asked whether
inhibition of HIF1α per se contributed to cell death in this model. First, based on data from
our cell screen, both LY294002 and rapamycin were significantly less effective in inhibiting
cell growth or causing cytotoxicity than was vandetanib (Table S1). Further, NAC reduced
HIF1α expression as effectively as did vandetanib, but with no toxicity, indicating that
inhibition of NRF2 without relief from the underlying oxidative stress is at least a necessary,
if not sufficient determinant of vandetanib toxicity (Figure S5E-F). This possibility is
consistent with our earlier findings that DMF-stimulated NRF2 activity is at least partially
ROS-dependent. In support of this hypothesis, both ABL1 inhibition and silencing decreased
expression of the endogenous NRF2 transcriptional target NQO1 (Figure 5H), which is
strongly upregulated in HLRCC tumor tissue (Figure S5H; (Adam et al., 2011)). Finally,
silencing of NRF2 with two independent siRNAs caused significant cytotoxicity in UOK262
cells, a phenotype that was reversed in UOK262WT (Figure S5G).
To assess whether these findings are recapitulated in vivo, we examined the effect of
vandetanib on NQO1 expression in HLRCC xenografts. Its expression was significantly
decreased in UOK262 xenografts excised from mice treated with vandetanib (Figure S5I;
tissues from the animal study described in Figure 4).

AMPK activation inhibits NRF2 activity additively with vandetanib to inhibit FH −/− RCC
tumor growth

Author Manuscript

SIRT1-mediated deacetylation of NRF2 is reported to inhibit its transcriptional activity
(Kawai et al., 2011). Since AMPK positively regulates SIRT1 and is constitutively
hypoactivated in FH-deficient tumors (Tong et al., 2011; Fulco and Sartorelli, 2008), we
asked whether pharmacologic activation of AMPK in these cells might enhance SIRT1
deacetylase activity to inhibit NRF2 independently from vandetanib. First, we assessed the
effect of AMPK modulation on NRF2 transcriptional activity using a luciferase-reporter
assay. The AMPK activators metformin and AICAR decreased DMF-stimulated NRF2
activity in HEK293 and UOK262 cells, while knockdown/inhibition of SIRT1 with siRNA
or nicotinamide, respectively, had the opposite effect (although the increased NRF2 activity
remained sensitive to vandetanib, Figure 6A, Figure S6A-B). Consistent with these data,
metformin treatment decreased NRF2 acetylation in UOK262 cells while silencing SIRT1
had the opposite effect (Figure 6B).

Author Manuscript

Next, we examined whether combining metformin and vandetanib caused additive inhibition
of NRF2. Data obtained using a luciferase-reporter in HEK293 cells and by monitoring
endogenous NQO1 expression in UOK262 cells suggested that this is the case (Figure 6C
and Figure S6C). Supporting these observations, we found that metformin, at a
concentration lacking single agent toxicity, significantly decreased the viability of UOK262
cells when combined with a sub-optimal concentration of vandetanib (Figure 6D). Since
both vandetanib and metformin have multiple effects in cells, we confirmed that their
additive impact on NRF2 was due to ABL1 inhibition combined with AMPK activation.
Thus, both metformin and AICAR cooperated with knockdown of ABL1 to markedly reduce
cell viability, while, in the absence of ABL1 silencing, neither drug was effective. Further,
nilotinib displayed greater cytotoxicity at lower concentrations in combination with
metformin compared with its single agent activity (Figure S6D-F). Finally, in vivo analysis
confirmed that low dose vandetanib (10 mg/kg, once weekly; 1/10th of the dose used in the
experiment shown in Figure 4) combined with metformin (5 mg/kg, once weekly) induced
complete tumor regression within 8 weeks of treatment initiation in 100% of treated mice
(Figures 6E-F, 12 of 12 mice from 2 independent experiments). No tumor regressions were
seen in mice treated with the single agents at these doses. Nine of ten mice treated with the
vandetanib/metformin combination remained tumor-free for more than 13 months after
treatment cessation, while vehicle-treated mice all had to be sacrificed by 8 weeks due to
tumor size (Figure 6G).

DISCUSSION
Author Manuscript

Loss of FH activity leads to fumarate accumulation that sustains both aerobic glycolysis and
NRF2-mediated antioxidant responses (Isaacs et al., 2005; Ooi et al., 2011; Adam et al.,
2011). Although both pathways are critical for HLRCC cancer growth in vivo, a strategy to
simultaneously target these processes has eluded investigators. Here, we show that ABL1, a
non-receptor tyrosine kinase involved in numerous biological processes including cell
proliferation, cell migration, metabolism and apoptosis (Greuber et al., 2013), is indirectly
activated by increased fumarate, likely as a consequence of elevated ROS levels, and

supports both aerobic glycolysis and NRF2 activity in HLRCC tumor cells (Figure 7). Using
an unbiased screen, we identified the tyrosine kinase inhibitor vandetanib as having
particular potency in an HLRCC-derived cell line in vitro and we found that vandetanib
efficacy was compromised by restoration of wild-type FH activity in these cells. Although
vandetanib inhibits several other kinases in addition to ABL1, we found that ABL1
knockdown using two different siRNAs as well as a human ABL1-targeted miRNA
mimicked vandetanib cytotoxicity, as did several other TKIs that share ABL1 inhibitory
activity with vandetanib. In addition, re-expression of active murine ABL1 rescued cells
from these effects, and re-expression of TKI-resistant ABL1 abrogated vandetanib toxicity.
Taken together, these data suggest that ABL1 inhibition accounts for much of the
vandetanib effect in HLRCC cells, although we cannot exclude the possibility that an offtarget effect contributes to the potency of vandetanib in this tumor model.

Author Manuscript

A common characteristic of advanced cancer is enhanced dependence on glucose and on
glycolytic metabolism (Vander Heiden et al., 2009). In this regard, FH-deficient tumor cells,
with their disrupted TCA cycle, are examples of the Warburg effect and represent a humanderived, genetically defined tumor model with which to evaluate therapeutic strategies
designed to interdict these pathways. Although targeting aerobic glycolysis in cancer has
yielded promising results in vitro, in vivo efficacy has been limited, often due to systemic
toxicities. Our current findings reveal a potential role for ABL1 in modulating mTORdependent HIF1α expression and demonstrate that both vandetanib and ABL1 knockdown
phenocopy several consequences of HIF1α silencing in HLRCC cells, including reduced
HIF1α protein expression and transcriptional activity, reduced aerobic glycolysis (in vitro
and in vivo) and reduced cell invasiveness (Tong et al., 2011).

Given these data it is perhaps surprising that LY294002 and rapamycin were not more active
in our in vitro growth inhibition/cytotoxicity screen (see Table S1). However, HIF
modulation alone would not be expected to fully correct either the underlying defect in
fumarate metabolism or the resultant accompanying oxidative stress, phenomena identified
in our current study as key contributors to the cytotoxicity of both vandetanib and ABL1
knockdown. We previously reported that HLRCC-derived cell lines express abundant
HIF1α as a consequence of both direct fumarate-mediated inhibition of HIF prolyl
hydroxylase and indirect effects of elevated ROS levels (Isaacs et al., 2005; Klimova and
Chandel, 2008; Sudarshan et al, 2009; Tong et al., 2011). Highly glycolytic cancers,
including HLRCC-associated kidney cancer, generate excessive ROS and depend on an
efficient oxidative stress response transcriptional program, suggesting that disruption or
overwhelming of this machinery may provide an alternative treatment strategy (Sourbier et
al., 2010). NRF2 is the master transcriptional regulator of the anti-oxidant response. Under
non-stress conditions, it is sequestered in the cytoplasm by the adaptor protein, KEAP1,
which also facilitates NRF2 ubiquitination and its subsequent proteasome-mediated
degradation. In the presence of oxidative stress, cysteine residues in KEAP1 are oxidized to
inactivate the protein, promoting stabilization of NRF2 in the cytoplasm. In HLRCC cells,
elevated intracellular fumarate inactivates KEAP1 by covalently modifying its cysteine
residues in a process termed succination, resulting in constitutive stabilization of NRF2
(Adam et al., 2011; Ooi et al., 2011). NRF2 is also regulated by the protein deacetylase

SIRT1, and Ooi and colleagues recently identified SIRT1 mutations as contributors to NRF2
activation in papillary type II renal cancer, a sporadic cancer that is histologically similar to
HRLCC (Ooi et al., 2013), suggesting that stabilization and activation of NRF2-driven antioxidant responses may be important factors in kidney cancers.

Author Manuscript

ABL1 is an important, SIRT1-independent determinant of NRF2 nuclear localization and
transcriptional activity both in vitro and in vivo (Figure 7). Our data are consistent with
previous studies in other tumor models reporting that ABL1 is activated by oxidative stress
and DNA damage, and affects the NRF2-dependent antioxidant response (Sun et al., 2000;
Greuber et al., 2013; Li et al., 2004). Since aberrant activation of NRF2 signaling occurs in
multiple tumor types (Figure S7A), it is reasonable to speculate that targeting ABL1 might
be a useful therapeutic strategy for such tumors in addition to HLRCC. Preliminary data
obtained using a panel of lung cancer cell lines support this hypothesis (Figure S7B-C), and
suggest that expression of NQO1 may be a predictive biomarker of response.
Finally, we found that upregulation of AMPK (constitutively hypoactive in HLRCC) (Tong
et al., 2011), either as a consequence of mitochondrial complex I inhibition with metformin
or following treatment with the AMPK activator AICAR, was additive with ABL1 inhibition
in maximally inhibiting NRF2 activity in vitro. The sensitivity of NRF2 to AMPK activation
is likely a consequence of AMPK-dependent SIRT1 activation, since metformin decreased
nicotinamide-sensitive NRF2 acetylation. Notably, in an HLRCC xenograft model, inclusion
of metformin (at a clinically achievable dose) reduced the effective vandetanib concentration
by 90% (compared to single agent vandetanib administration). Weekly administration of this
drug combination for 8 weeks caused complete tumor regression in 100% of treated mice
and extended tumor-free survival for more than one year after cessation of treatment.

Author Manuscript

In summary, our data show that ABL1 is a key, pharmacologically tractable modulator of
the cellular stress response to excess fumarate accumulation. Since ABL1 also supports HIFdependent glycolytic metabolism, inhibiting this kinase provides a clinically viable strategy
to simultaneously interfere with aerobic glycolysis and the anti-oxidant response pathway,
upon which highly glycolytic, oxidatively stressed tumors depend for survival.

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Cell lines and cell culture

Author Manuscript

UOK262, UOK268, UOK262WT, UOK268WT, and UOK150 cell lines were established in
the Urologic Oncology Branch from surgically resected tumor specimens (National Cancer
Institute, Bethesda, MD) (Yang et al., 2010; Anglard et al., 1992; Yang et al., 2012). All
other cell lines were purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA). Cells were cultured in high
glucose DMEM without pyruvate supplemented with 10% FBS. The cells were harvested or
treated when they reached 70-80% confluence.
Chemical agents
Vandetanib was generously provided by Astra Zeneca (Wilmington, DE). PTHrPneutralizing antibody was from Bachem (Torrance, CA). All other compounds used were
from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO) or Selleck Chemicals (Houston, TX).

Human Tissues

Author Manuscript

All human tissues were obtained with informed consent from patients enrolled on a Urologic
Oncology Branch Clinical Protocol approved by the Institutional Review Board of the
National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health.
ABL1 kinase activity assay

Author Manuscript

Five nanograms of purified ABL1 protein (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) and the
peptide substrate paxillin (Santa-Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX) were incubated for 1 hr at
30°C with 10 μM ATP in kinase assay buffer. The reaction was stopped by adding
denaturing sample buffer and phosphorylation of the recognition motif I/V/L-Y-X-X-P/F
was assessed by immunoblot analysis. Alternatively, the reaction was stopped by adding
ADP-Glo™ reagent (ADPGlo™ kinase assay kit, Promega, Madison, WI) and kinase
activity was assessed following the manufacturer's instructions.
ABL1 constructs and infection

Author Manuscript

Murine ABL1 constructs and miRNA targeting human ABL1 (not recognizing murine ABL)
were introduced into HEK293 and UOK262 cells following a previously described protocol
(Smith-Pearson et al., 2010; Yogalingam and Pendergast, 2008) with the following
modifications. Briefly, lentiviruses were generated in HEK293T cells as previously
described (Smith-Pearson et al., 2010; Yogalingam and Pendergast, 2008). Supernatant
containing the viral particles was collected 48 hr post-transfection, aliquoted and stored at
-80oC until usage. Five thousand UOK262 or HEK293 cells were plated in blackview 96well plates and 50,000 cells were seeded in 6-well plates. The former were used for viability
determination and the later were used for Western blotting (see text). The day after plating,
cells were infected with the different viruses using 1:30 v/v miRNA/media and 1:30 v/v
vector/media per well in the presence of polybrene (8 μg/mL). The media were changed 24
hr post-infection. Forty-eight hours post-infection, cells were treated as indicated in the
figures. Seventy-two hours post-infection, protein lysates were harvested for Western
blotting or cell viability assays were performed.
Animal study
All animal experiments were performed on approved protocols and in accordance with the
guidelines of the Animal Care and Use Committee of the National Institutes of Health.

MRI of hyperpolarized 13C-labeled pyruvate metabolism

Author Manuscript

Samples of [1-13C] pyruvic acid (30 μL) containing 15 mM triarylmethyl radical (TAM) and
2.5 mM gadolium chelate ProHance (Bracco Diagnostics, Milano, Italy) were polarized at
3.35 T and 1.4 K in a Hypersense DNP Polarizer (Oxford Instruments), according to the
manufacturer's instructions. After 40-60 min, the hyperpolarized sample was rapidly
dissolved in 4.5 mL of a superheated alkaline buffer comprising 40 mM 4-(2hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid (HEPES), 30 mM NaCl and 100 mg/L
ethylendiaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA). NaOH was added to the dissolution buffer to adjust
pH to 7.4 after mixture with [1-13C] pyruvic acid. Hyperpolarized [1-13C] pyruvate solution
(12 μL/g body weight) was intravenously injected through a catheter placed in the tail vein

of the mouse. Hyperpolarized 13C MRI studies were performed on a 7 T scanner (Bruker
Bio-Spin MRI GmbH) using a 17 mm home-built 13C solenoid coil placed inside of a saddle
coil for 1H. The 13C two-dimensional spectroscopic images were acquired 30 seconds after
the start of pyruvate injection from a 28 × 28 mm field of view in a 8 mm coronal slice
through the tumor, with matrix size of 16 × 16, spectral width of 8 kHz, repetition time (TR)
78 ms, 0.2 ms Gaussian excitation pulse with a flip angle of 10°. The total time required to
acquire an image was 20 seconds.
ATP assay
ATP levels were determined using the ATPLite assay (PerkinElmer, Shelton, Connecticut),
following the manufacturer's protocol.
Immunofluorescence

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Immunofluorescence was performed as previously described (Sourbier et al., 2013). Briefly,
5000 UOK262 cells were plated in 2-well chamber-slides (Nunc., Sigma-Aldrich) and
treated for 6 hr with vandetanib (20 nM) before fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde. Cells
were blocked for 1 hr with BSA (3%) and permeabilized with Triton (0.5%). Mouse antiNRF2 antibody (dilution 1:100; dilution; Abcam # 62352) was added and chamber slides
were incubated overnight at 4°C in a humidified atmosphere. After 3 washes with TBST
buffer, slides were incubated 1 hr with secondary antibody coupled to Alexa455 (dilution
1:1000), washed and mounted. Nuclei were stained with DAPI (Cell Signaling Technology).
Images were captured with a confocal microscope (Zeiss NLO510). Nuclear localization
was quantified by measuring the corrected total cell fluorescence (CTCF) in the nuclei of the
cells. Briefly, the intensity of 5 nuclei from 10 different fields per condition were measured
using Image J. CTCF was then calculated with the following formula: CTCF = Integrated
Density – (Area of selected cell × Mean fluorescence of background readings).
NRF2 reporter assay
NRF2 transcriptional activity was measured using the pGL4.37[luc2/ARE/Hygro] vector
(Promega, Madison, WI), following the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, 5000 HEK293
cells were plated in white-clear view plates (Perkin-Elmer) and were transfected the
following day with 100 ng of DNA per well using XTreme Gene HP transfection reagent
(Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN). After 24 hr, cells were treated as indicated in
Figure Legends. Luminescence was measured as an indicator of NRF2 transcriptional
activity using the Dual-Glo Luciferase Assay System (Promega). The Renilla luciferase
plasmid was co-transfected as recommended by the manufacturer to normalize the results.

SIGNIFICANCE
Patients with germline fumarate hydratase (FH) mutation are predisposed to develop
aggressive kidney cancer with few treatment options and poor therapeutic outcomes. An
unbiased drug screen using FH-deficient tumor-derived cell lines identified the tyrosine
kinase inhibitor vandetanib to be highly cytotoxic both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistic
studies revealed that vandetanib-mediated cytotoxicity is ABL1-dependent. ABL1 is
activated in both FH-deficient kidney tumor specimens and tumor-derived cell lines, and
simultaneously promotes aerobic glycolysis and NRF2-mediated antioxidant defense. In
animal xenograft studies, an 8-week regimen of drug treatment resulted in 13 months of
tumor-free survival. Thus, inhibiting ABL1 may provide a clinically feasible strategy for
treating patients with highly aggressive FH-deficient kidney cancer and perhaps
additional glycolytic, oxidatively stressed tumors.

immunoblotting for phosphorylated ABL1 following immunoprecipitation of ABL1 protein
from tissue lysates. The intensity ratio of phosphorylated ABL1 to total ABL1 was assessed
by densitometric analysis. B. Assessment of ABL1 activation status in a panel of cell lines
was performed as in (A). C. Rescue with various infected murine ABL proteins was
performed 72 hr after lentiviral infection of UOK262 cells with ABL-targeted miRNA
(miABL). Scrambled miRNA (miSCR) was used as an miRNA control and empty pBABE
vector (BABE) served as the control for infection with the various murine ABL contructs.
Murine ABL constructs included wild type (WT), kinase-dead (K290M), kinase inhibitorresistant (T315I), and constitutively active ABL (P131I). Cell viability in presence and
absence of vandetanib was assessed (24 hr, 50 nM; VAN: vandetanib). D. Immunoblot
showing reduction in ABL1 protein expression 72 hr post miABL infection, and subsequent
expression level of re-introduced murine ABL proteins. mTOR phosphorylation status is
correlated with expression of competent ABL1 protein. E. Silencing of ABL1 with siRNA is
cytotoxic for FH-deficient cells. F. Importance of ABL1 for soft agar colony growth of FHdeficient cells was assessed by measuring the number of colonies visible 4 weeks after
seeding with cells treated as shown. VAN, vandetanib; IMA, imatinib; * p<0.05, **
p<0.001. Data are displayed as the mean ± SD. See also Figure S2.

A. Expression of the glucose transporters Glut1 and Glut4 following vandetanib treatment
(24 hr) in UOK262 cells. B. Glucose uptake was measured in UOK262 cells using the nondegradable fluorescent glucose analog 2-NBDG (20 μM) after vandetanib (VAN; 20 nM, 16
hr) or imatinib (IMA; 200 nM, 16 hr) treatment, or after silencing either ABL1 or HIF1α. C.
Lactate secretion after vandetanib treatment (20 nM, 16 hr). D. The effect of ABL1 silencing
or inhibition on aerobic glycolysis in UOK262 cells was measured by recording the
extracellular acidification rate (ECAR, a surrogate for lactate secretion) in a Seahorse
Bioanalyzer. VAN, vandetanib; IMA, imatinib; * p<0.05. Data are displayed as the mean ±
SD. See also Figure S3.

A. 13C-hyperpolarized imaging of mice harboring UOK262 xenografts before and 2 days
after treatment with vandetanib. The images on the left display representative NMR images,
the right set of images display representative images of the lactate/pyruvate ratio. B.
Quantification of lactate/pyruvate ratios from data obtained in (A). Averaged measurements
obtained from 5 animals in each group were used. C. Growth of UOK262 xenografts treated
once weekly with vehicle (DMSO/PBS) or vandetanib (100 mg/kg). Right panel: Averaged
tumor volume of 2 independent experiments taken after 7 weeks of treatment. D. ABL1
kinase activity was measured by kinase assay after immunopurification of ABL1 protein
from tumor tissues excised from vehicle-treated and vandetanib-treated mice 2 days posttreatment. ** p<0.01; * p<0.05; VAN, vandetanib. Data are displayed as the mean ± SD.

A. Basal in vitro ABL1 kinase activity in UOK262WT and UOK262 cells (normalized to
total protein). B. Effect of intracellular fumarate accumulation on ABL1 activity in HEK293
and UOK262 cells (DMF, dimethylfumarate; Fum, fumarate; 0.25 mM, 4 hr). C-E. The
impact of vandetanib on NRF2 nuclear/cytoplasmic distribution was assessed by
immunoblotting of both nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts (C) and by confocal
immunofluorescence microscopy (D-E). Original magnification x63; bar scale 25μm. F.
NRF2 transcriptional activity was assessed in HEK293 cells following treatment with
vandetanib (VAN, 50 nM, 4 hr) and/or DMF (*: significance compared to CTL; #:
significance compared to DMF-induced NRF2 transcriptional activity) using a NRF2responsive luciferase reporter assay and normalized to co-transfected Renilla luciferase. G.

Figure 7. ABL1 is a key regulator of both aerobic glycolysis and the antioxidant stress response
in HLRCC tumors

The model depicts a proposed dual role for ABL1 in supporting FH-deficient tumor cell
viability and energy metabolism. By stimulating mTOR activity to increase HIF1α
translation, ABL1 promotes aerobic glycolysis, thus enabling the tumor cells to meet their
energetic needs. Simultaneously, ABL1 also facilitates NRF2 nuclear localization, thus
supporting its transcriptional activity, which allows tumor cells to buffer the high oxidative
stress that is a consequence of excess fumarate accumulation. See also Figure S7.
