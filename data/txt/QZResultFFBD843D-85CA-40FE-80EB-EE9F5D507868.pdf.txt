BACKGROUND: Everolimus is a novel inhibitor of the mammalian target of rapamycin pathway, which is aberrantly
activated in nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The authors conducted a phase 1 and pharmacokinetic study of everolimus and docetaxel for recurrent NSCLC. METHODS: Patients with advanced stage NSCLC and progression after
prior platinum-based chemotherapy were eligible. Sequential cohorts were treated with escalating doses of docetaxel
(Day 1) and everolimus (orally daily, Days 1-19) every 3 weeks. Pharmacokinetic sampling of everolimus and docetaxel
was done in Cycle 1. The primary endpoint was determination of the recommended phase 2 doses of the combination. RESULTS: Twenty-four patients were enrolled (median age, 62 years; women, 11; number of prior regimens, 1 [n
¼ 13], 2 [n ¼ 6], 3 [n ¼ 5]; Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, 0 [n ¼ 6], 1 [n ¼ 17]). The
dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) were fever with grade 3/4 neutropenia, grade 3 fatigue, and grade 3 mucositis. None
of the 7 patients treated at the recommended phase 2 dose (docetaxel 60 mg/m2 and everolimus 5 mg daily) experienced DLT. Everolimus area under the concentration time curve (AUC) was not different with 60 or 75 mg/m2 docetaxel. Mean  standard deviation AUC-based accumulation factors for everolimus on Days 8 and 15 were 1.16  0.37
and 1.42  0.42, respectively. Docetaxel Day 1 half-life was 9.4  3.4 hours. Among 21 patients evaluable, 1 had a partial response, and 10 had disease stabilization. CONCLUSIONS: The recommended phase 2 doses of docetaxel and
everolimus for combination therapy are 60 mg/m2 and 5 mg orally daily, respectively. Promising anticancer activity

The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway plays a central role in regulating cell growth, proliferation, and
survival.1 It is activated in response to cellular stress or nutrient deprivation, and consequently induces translation of several cell survival proteins. mTOR is an important part of the PI3K/Akt cell signaling axis, which is a major cell survival
pathway.2 Activation of the PI3K/Akt axis is associated with malignant transformation and resistance to apoptosis.3
Therefore, inhibitors of the mTOR pathway are under evaluation for the treatment of cancer. Temsirolimus and everolimus are novel inhibitors of the mTOR pathway that have received approval by the US Food and Drug Administration for
the treatment of renal cell carcinoma. Their approval was based on randomized clinical trials finding that each drug
improved overall survival and progression-free survival.4,5 Everolimus binds with high affinity to FKB12, the intracellular
receptor for mTOR; forms an intracellular complex that interacts with mTOR; and inhibits downstream signaling.6 It is

administered by mouth (PO) and can be given on either a
daily or a weekly schedule.7 Everolimus has demonstrated
anticancer effects in a variety of preclinical models.8,9
The mTOR pathway is aberrantly activated in nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Approximately 70% of
NSCLCs have activated mTOR signaling.10 In addition,
PI3K/Akt signaling is dysregulated in a majority of
NSCLCs.11,12 A phase 2 study by Soria et al demonstrated
a response rate of 5% when everolimus was used as monotherapy in patients with recurrent or refractory NSCLC.13
In addition, several patients had disease stabilization.
These interesting observations form the basis for evaluating mTOR inhibitors in combination with agents that
have proven activity in the treatment of NSCLC.
Docetaxel is a semisynthetic taxane that is approved
for the treatment of advanced NSCLC.14 It can be used in
the front-line therapy setting in combination with a platinum compound or as monotherapy in the second-line
treatment of advanced stage NSCLC. In addition to its activity in NSCLC, docetaxel is also used in routine care for
several other solid organ malignancies, including breast,
prostate, ovarian, head and neck, and gastric cancers.15
Docetaxel exerts anticancer effects by inducing polymerization of tubulin, which leads to mitotic arrest. Activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR axis is a known mechanism
of resistance to taxane therapy.16 Up-regulation of p-Akt
has been noted in response to exposure to tubulin-interactive agents, such as taxanes and vincristine, and is postulated as contributing to resistance to the anticancer effects
of these agents. Inhibition of mTOR in cancer cells with
up-regulated p-AKT is associated with sensitization to
tubulin-interactive agents.17 Preclinical studies using a variety of cell lines have demonstrated synergistic interactions between docetaxel and everolimus.17-21 On the basis
of these observations, we hypothesized that coadministration of an mTOR inhibitor with docetaxel would be associated with enhanced anticancer effects in patients with
advanced NSCLC. Both docetaxel and everolimus are
extensively metabolized by CYP3A4 and exhibit doseproportional increases in peak concentrations and exposure. Everolimus was associated with a 33% interpatient
variability in area under the concentration versus time
curve (AUC) as a single agent and warrants pharmacokinetic (PK) evaluation when given in combination with
other CYP3A4 substrates.7 We conducted a phase 1 study
to determine the optimal doses of everolimus and docetaxel that can be administered as a combination to
patients with advanced stage NSCLC and to evaluate the
feasibility of this approach.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
The primary objective of this study was to determine the
recommended doses of docetaxel and everolimus that can
be administered as a combination. The secondary objectives were: to define the dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs)
and non-DLTs of the regimen; to characterize the PK
disposition of everolimus and docetaxel when given in
combination; and to obtain preliminary information
regarding the efficacy of the combination in patients with
advanced stage NSCLC.
Patient Eligibility
Eligible patients had histological or cytological confirmation of NSCLC that was advanced stage and progressed
after at least 1 prior chemotherapy regimen. Other pertinent eligibility criteria were an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) of 0-2,
age >18 years, and life expectancy >12 weeks. Qualifying
laboratory criteria were leukocytes 3000/lL, absolute
neutrophil count 1500/lL, platelet count 100,000/
lL, serum total bilirubin 1.5  institutional upper limit
of normal (ULN), serum transaminases 2.5  ULN,
and serum creatinine 1.5  ULN. Patients had to have
recovered from toxicities related to prior therapies to
grade <2, and at least 3 weeks should have elapsed since
prior chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Patients with
untreated or symptomatic brain metastasis were excluded.
Patients who had received prior therapy with a known
mTOR inhibitor, were on full dose anticoagulation therapy with warfarin, had known human immunodeficiency
virus seropositivity, or were unable to take oral medications on a regular basis were excluded. Pregnant or lactating women were not allowed in the study because of the
potential for teratogenic effects with the combination regimen. Patients with a serious comorbid illness, known
hypersensitivity to docetaxel, or other active malignancies
were also excluded. Men and women of reproductive
age were required to use appropriate contraception. All
patients provided written informed consent before entering the study. The study protocol and consent form were
approved by the institutional review board of Emory
University.
Treatment Plan
Docetaxel was administered as a 60-minute intravenous
infusion on Day 1 of each cycle. Everolimus was given PO
on Days 1 to 19 of each 3-week treatment cycle. All treatments were administered in the outpatient setting. Dexamethasone was administered as a premedication at a dose

of 8 mg twice a day for 3 days beginning the day before
docetaxel infusion. The dose escalation scheme is outlined
in Table 1. Intrapatient dose escalation was not permitted.
Treatment cycles were continued until progression of disease, unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal of informed
consent. After 6 cycles of combination therapy, patients
without disease progression were continued on singleagent everolimus at the same dose and schedule as when
given with docetaxel.
The use of appropriate supportive care measures was
allowed for adverse events associated with therapy. Prophylactic colony-stimulating factors were not allowed for
Cycle 1 of therapy. For patients who experienced severe
toxicity, dose modifications were done for subsequent
cycles. The dose of everolimus was reduced by 2.5-mg/d
decrements, and the dose of docetaxel was reduced by 15mg/m2 decrements. For patients who experienced grade 3
of 4 neutropenia with fever, grade 4 neutropenia lasting
>7 days, grade 4 thrombocytopenia, or grade 3 nonhematological toxicity, the doses of both agents were
reduced. For grade 2 peripheral neuropathy or renal
toxicity, the dose of docetaxel was reduced. Docetaxel was
permanently discontinued in the event of a grade 4 hypersensitivity reaction. All dose reductions were permanent.
With the exception of alopecia, neuropathy, and unrelated laboratory values, toxicities had to resolve to grade
1 before initiation of the subsequent cycle of therapy.
Initiation of a new cycle could be delayed up to 2 weeks to
allow for recovery from toxicity, failing which the patient
was removed from the study.
Definition of DLT
DLT was defined as the occurrence of 1 or more of the following events during Cycle 1 of therapy: grade 3 of 4 neutropenia associated with fever, grade 4 neutropenia lasting
>7 days, grade 4 thrombocytopenia, grade 3 nonhematological toxicity, or a toxicity-related delay of >2 weeks
to initiate Cycle 2. An up and down dose escalation
scheme was used, with cohorts of 3 patients. The first
cohort was treated at dose level 1. If 1 of the 3 patients in a

Cancer

August 15, 2010

cohort experienced DLT, 3 more patients were added at
the same level. If 0 of 3 initial patients or 1 of 6 patients in
an expanded cohort experienced DLT, the dose for the
next cohort was escalated by 1 level. Escalation stopped,
and de-escalation by 1 dose level began as soon as 2
patients at a dose level experienced DLT. If only 3 patients
had been treated at the previous dose level, up to 3 additional patients were to be entered at that dose level. Dose
de-escalation continued until 1 of 6 patients at a dose
level experienced DLT, and that level was defined as the
recommended phase 2 dose.
Patient Evaluation
Pretreatment evaluations included history and physical
examination (H&P), assessment of PS, complete blood
count (CBC), and hepatic and renal function tests. Serum
triglycerides and a full lipid profile were obtained at baseline. Women of reproductive age underwent a serum
pregnancy test. Patients were evaluated weekly with a
CBC and hepatic and renal function tests. Serum chemistry tests were done on Day 1 of each cycle from Cycle 2
onward. Radiological studies to assess response were performed after every 2 cycles of therapy. All patients underwent a positron emission tomogram scan at baseline and
after Cycle 2. H&P and assessment of PS were done
before initiation of each cycle. Responses were assessed
with Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors.22
PK Assessments
PK studies were conducted during Cycle 1 of therapy. On
Days 1, 8, and 15, peripheral blood was obtained 30
minutes before administration of everolimus and 1, 2, 5,
8, and 24 hours after dosing. Docetaxel sampling
occurred on Day 1 only. Blood samples (2 mL) were
obtained from a peripheral vein into potassium-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) tubes (everolimus) and
sodium heparin tubes (docetaxel). Each potassium-EDTA
tube was inverted several times to mix the contents and
then stored at 20 C within 60 minutes. Everolimus
concentrations were measured by a validated method
including liquid chromatography (LC)/mass spectrometry (MS) analysis after a high throughput liquid/liquid
extraction as previously described.23 The lower limit of
quantification was 0.3 ng/mL. Plasma was prepared from
sodium heparin tubes that were centrifuged at 4 C at
3000  g for 10 minutes, and the resulting plasma was
stored at 80 C until analysis. Docetaxel concentrations
in plasma were measured by a validated LC-MS/MS
assay.24 WinNonlin Professional software version 5.2

(Pharsight Corporation, St. Louis, Mo) and standard
noncompartmental methods were used to calculate AUC,
maximum observed concentration (Cmax), and elimination half-life.

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
Twenty-four patients were enrolled between October
2007 and December 2008. One patient who signed
informed consent did not start treatment because of rapid
progression of disease. The median age was 62 years, and
the majority of the patients had an ECOG performance
status of 0 or 1 (Table 2). Eleven patients were women.
NSCLC not otherwise specified was the most common
histological subtype (42%), followed by adenocarcinoma
(38%) and squamous cell carcinoma (13%). Approximately half the patients had received at least 2 lines of
prior therapy for advanced stage NSCLC.
Toxicity
Three patients were initially entered onto dose level 1
(docetaxel 60 mg/m2, everolimus 5 mg PO daily), and no
DLT was noted. Subsequently, 6 patients were entered to
dose level 2 (docetaxel 75 mg/m2, everolimus 5 mg PO
daily). One DLT (fever with grade 4 neutropenia) was
observed. As specified in the protocol, dose escalation
continued, and 3 patients were enrolled to dose level 3
(docetaxel 75 mg/m2, everolimus 7.5 mg PO daily). The
second patient on dose level 3 developed grade 3 mucosi-

tis, which prompted enrollment of 3 additional patients
to dose level 3. The fourth patient enrolled at dose level 3
developed fever with grade 4 neutropenia. On the basis of
the observation of 2 DLTs in 4 patients, dose level 3 was
deemed undeliverable, and dose level 2 was expanded by
an additional 6 patients to obtain additional safety data.
However, 3 of those 6 additional patients developed DLT
(fever with grade 3-4 neutropenia). One patient enrolled
to dose level 2 only received 4 days of therapy and withdrew informed consent. On the basis of a telephone conversation with the patient, there was no evidence of DLT,
but the patient was replaced. Because there was a total of 4
DLTs in 13 patients, dose level 2 was also considered to
be above the maximally tolerated dose for the combination. Therefore, dose level 1 was expanded to a total of 7
patients. Dose level 1 was tolerated well, with only 1 episode of grade 3 neutropenia associated with fever. Therefore, dose level 1 (docetaxel 60 mg/m2, everolimus 5 mg
daily) was defined as the recommended phase 2 dose
(recommended phase 2 doses).
Overall, the treatment regimen was tolerated well at
the recommended phase 2 doses. The median number of
cycles of chemotherapy administered in the study was 2

on monotherapy with everolimus. The common hematological and nonhematological toxicities associated with
the regimen are outlined in Tables 3 and 4.
Pharmacokinetics
Everolimus and docetaxel concentrations and PK profiles
were available in 19 and 5 patients, respectively (Table 5).
Everolimus exposure as measured by mean AUC and
Cmax increased proportionally with dose. Because of continuous dosing and the sampling schedule used, everolimus elimination half-lives could not be assessed
accurately. Everolimus accumulation through Cycle 1
based on ratios of Day 8 or 15 AUC0-24 to Day 1 AUC0-1
measurements in 7 subjects receiving 5 mg daily is shown in
Figure 1. Although sample sizes were small, docetaxel halflives were consistent with previously reported values.25
Antitumor Activity
Sixteen patients received >1 cycle of therapy. All patients
who received at least 1 dose of therapy were considered
evaluable for response. A 68-year-old female patient with
adenocarcinoma of the lung that had failed 6 prior systemic therapy regimens experienced a partial response.
There was regression in the primary tumor mass in the
lung and multiple bilateral pulmonary nodules. She
received a total of 6 cycles of combination therapy and
3 additional cycles of everolimus monotherapy. Ten
patients achieved disease stabilization. Three of 6 patients

DISCUSSION
Docetaxel is an agent used commonly as second-line therapy for advanced NSCLC. Several randomized studies
that evaluated combination cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens for second-line therapy of advanced NSCLC failed
to establish survival benefit, although there was higher
toxicity.26 Therefore, combinations of molecularly targeted agents with standard chemotherapy are under investigation in an effort to overcome the therapeutic plateau

that has been noted for second-line therapy of advanced
NSCLC.
Inhibition of the mTOR pathway has emerged as a
novel strategy for the treatment of cancer. Everolimus, an
agent approved for the treatment of renal cell carcinoma,
has demonstrated anticancer activity in NSCLC and
exhibits preclinical synergy with docetaxel.13,17 Our phase
1 study was conducted to determine the recommended
phase 2 doses for the combination for docetaxel and everolimus. Overall, the regimen was tolerated well. Four of
13 patients experienced fever with grade 3 or 4 neutropenia when docetaxel was given at a dose of 75 mg/m2 in
combination with everolimus at 5 mg PO daily. In the
pivotal studies of single-agent docetaxel for second-line
therapy of NSCLC, the incidence of fever with neutropenia was 2% to 12%.27-29 The observed higher incidence
in our study could be attributed to the degree of prior
therapy in our patient population or to the addition of
everolimus to docetaxel. We decided to evaluate the 60mg/m2 dose of docetaxel to improve the tolerability of the
regimen. In randomized studies conducted in Japan, the
60-mg/m2 dose of docetaxel has been shown to be efficacious in the treatment of NSCLC.30 Notably, the 5-mg/d
dose of everolimus has been documented to produce the
desired pharmacodynamic effects.31,32
The overall efficacy of the regimen used in our study
was promising, as disease control was achieved in approximately 50% of the patients. We believe that the promising
efficacy of docetaxel and everolimus in light of multiple
prior therapies in our patients justifies further evaluation
of this combination. Therefore, we have initiated a phase
2 study of the combination in patients with advanced
NSCLC that had progressed after 1 or 2 prior regimens.
An important secondary objective of that phase 2 study
will be to identify baseline molecular markers in tumor
tissues that may predict for a favorable outcome in
response to the combination. We intend to evaluate baseline status of Akt, which is upstream of mTOR, and of
pS6k and 4E-BP1, which are downstream of mTOR.
Everolimus is a substrate for CYP3A4 and a mixed
inhibitor of CYP2D6. However, at a dose of 5 mg/d, the
steady-state concentration achieved is several-fold less
than that required to alter the metabolism of substrates of
CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. Because docetaxel is metabolized
by CYP3A4, conducting full PK evaluations of docetaxel
would have been instrumental in documenting the effect
of everolimus on docetaxel disposition. However, the
intervals at which samples were obtained in our study rendered it difficult to evaluate docetaxel pharmacokinetics

3908

completely. Similarly, the sampling interval used in our
evaluation of continuous everolimus made detailed interpretation of half-life and elimination characteristics problematic. As a result, we intend to evaluate the PK of
docetaxel in a selected subset of patients in our phase 2
study.
To our knowledge, this is the first report of the combination of a chemotherapeutic agent with a continuous
daily dosing schedule of everolimus. Campone and colleagues conducted a phase 1 study using a weekly schedule
of everolimus with weekly paclitaxel.33 Their study
included 16 patients with various solid organ malignancies and noted disease stabilization in 11 of the 16
patients. The DLT in their study was primarily myelosuppression. Everolimus has also been safely combined with
inhibitors of the epidermal growth factor receptor pathway for the treatment of NSCLC.34,35 A randomized
phase 2 study of erlotinib alone or in combination with
everolimus in patients with advanced NSCLC has recently
completed accrual. Recently, phase 1 studies have been
initiated to evaluate everolimus in combination with platinum-based, 2-drug regimens for first-line therapy of
advanced NSCLC. In that the molecular mechanisms
behind resistance to common chemotherapeutic agents
are not dissimilar across various tumor types, the everolimus-based combinations may also be applicable to other
disease types.
In summary, our phase 1 study has demonstrated
the feasibility of combining docetaxel with everolimus
and also demonstrated promising efficacy of the combination in a refractory NSCLC patient population.
