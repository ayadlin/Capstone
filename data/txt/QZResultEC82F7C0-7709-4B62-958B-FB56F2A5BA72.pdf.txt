SUMMARY
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Current anti-mitotics work by perturbing spindle assembly, which activates the spindle assembly
checkpoint, causes mitotic arrest, and triggers apoptosis. Cancer cells can resist such killing by
premature exit, before cells initiate apoptosis, due to a weak checkpoint or rapid slippage. We
reasoned blocking mitotic exit downstream of the checkpoint might circumvent this resistance. Using
single-cell approaches, we showed that blocking mitotic exit by Cdc20 knockdown slowed cyclin
B1 proteolysis, thus allowed more time for death initiation. Killing by Cdc20 knockdown did not
require checkpoint activity, and can occur by intrinsic apoptosis, or an alternative death pathway
when Bcl2 was over-expressed. We conclude targeting Cdc20, or otherwise blocking mitotic exit,
may be a better cancer therapeutic strategy than perturbing spindle assembly.

INTRODUCTION

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Anti-mitotic drugs that target microtubule dynamics, including taxanes, vinca alkaloids and
epothilones, are active against a broad range of cancers, but they also cause neurotoxicity,
presumably due to perturbation of microtubules in neurons (Jordan and Wilson, 2004). In an
effort to develop anti-mitotic drugs lacking this toxicity, small molecules inhibitors of a number
of proteins specific to the mitotic spindle were developed, including the motor protein
Kinesin-5 (aka KSP, Eg5, Kif11), Aurora kinases, and Polo-like kinases (Jackson et al.,
2007). In clinical trials to date, these spindle-specific anti-mitotic drugs lack neurotoxicity as
hoped, but their efficacy against solid tumors seems to be no better than taxanes and vincas,
and perhaps not as good. Can we find an anti-mitotic strategy that not only lacks neurotoxity,
but is also more effective than current strategies at causing regression of solid tumors? We set
out to address this question using RNAi knockdown as a surrogate for potential drugs, and

SIGNIFICANCE
Drugs targeting spindle proteins, including Kinesin-5, Aurora kinases, and Polo-like kinases, were recently developed in the hope of less
neurotoxic anti-mitotic drugs. In clinical trials to date, their efficacy seems no better than taxanes and vincas. We provide evidence that
an alternative anti-mitotic strategy, blocking mitotic exit, might be more effective. We found Cdc20 knockdown provides a checkpointindependent mitotic arrest that kills cancer cells more effectively than spindle-perturbing drugs. We suggest mitotic exit is a promising
therapeutic target, and propose a cell-based screening strategy for compounds with this mechanism. These findings are significant from
a drug development perspective, and also as a mechanistic step towards understanding how mitotic arrest triggers death, and how some
cancer cells resist this trigger.

The net effect of anti-mitotic drugs is to perturb mitotic spindle assembly, which activates the
spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC). After many hours of SAC-induced mitotic arrest, cancer
cells either die inside mitosis, or exit mitosis by slippage into a tetraploid G1 state, from which
they either die, arrest in G1, or initiate a new round of the cell cycle (Rieder and Maiato,
2004; Gascoigne and Taylor, 2008; Orth et al., 2008). Slippage is thought to occur by gradual
proteolysis of cyclin B1, which continues slowly even when the SAC is active (Brito and
Rieder, 2006). Cell death occurs mainly via activation of the intrinsic apoptosis (Wang et al.,
1999; Park et al., 2004; Tao et al., 2005; Bergstralh and Ting, 2006), a pathway involving
mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP) (Letai, 2008). Failure to initiate
apoptosis during or after mitotic arrest appears to be a major factor limiting efficacy of antimitotic drugs, since mitotic arrest without subsequent apoptosis is commonly observed
following taxane treatment in various cancer cell lines (Shi et al., 2008), mouse cancers
(Milross et al., 1996), and, though data are very limited, human breast cancers, where it
correlates with poor tumor responses (Symmans et al., 2000). Here, we focus on drug resistance
caused by lack of apoptosis downstream of spindle damage; clinical resistance might also arise
from mutations that prevent drugs from causing spindle damage, e.g. due to target protein
mutations or drug efflux pump expression (Pusztai, 2007), from failure of cancer cells to enter
mitosis during drug exposure (Baguley et al., 1995), or other causes.
Previous studies provide two mechanistic clues to how cancer cells choose a non-apoptotic
outcome following spindle damage and mitotic arrest. First, they may fail to execute apoptosis
efficiently due to down-regulation of apoptosis pathways. Protection against MOMP at the
level of Bcl2 protein family reduces sensitivity to apoptosis promoted by paclitaxel and vinca
alkaloids (Tan et al., 2005; Deng et al., 2007; Kutuk and Letai, 2008). Second, they may slip
out of mitotic arrest before they die; in other words slippage and apoptosis can be viewed as
two competing pathways (Gascoigne and Taylor, 2008). Consistent with slippage protecting
cells from death, premature exit from mitotic arrest due to a weakened or ablated SAC is known
to decrease sensitivity to spindle-perturbing drugs (Taylor and McKeon, 1997; Shin et al.,
2003; Tao et al., 2005; Swanton et al., 2007; Gascoigne and Taylor, 2008; Bekier et al.,
2009). Based on these clues, we reasoned that blocking mitotic exit downstream of the SAC
may be a better strategy for killing apoptosis-resistant, slippage-prone or SAC-defective cancer
cells than any current anti-mitotic drugs, all of which target spindle assembly.

Cdc20 Knockdown Causes Mitotic Arrest and Cell Death
As surrogate for a potential drug that directly blocks mitotic exit, we knocked down Cdc20
using siRNAs. Cdc20 activates the APC/C to trigger cyclin B1 degradation during normal
mitosis, and it is sequestered by SAC proteins when the spindle is damaged (Figure 1A)
(Musacchio and Hardwick, 2002; Musacchio and Salmon, 2007). Cdc20 must be depleted to
less than 5% of its normal levels to arrest cells in mitosis (Wolthuis et al., 2008). We tested
several siRNA duplexes and hairpin constructs in HeLa cells, and selected two duplexes on
the basis of promoting the most robust mitotic arrest, and most efficient knockdown by
immunoblotting (Figure 1B). All data shown are for duplex 1, but similar results were obtained
using duplex 2. HeLa cells depleted of Cdc20 arrested in mitosis for an average of 18.8 ± 7.3
hr (n=98), before undergoing death in mitosis (Figure 1D, top panel). Specificity is a major
concern for siRNA duplexes; to evaluate this, we performed a RNAi-resistant transgene rescue
experiment for duplex 1, using mouse Cdc20 cDNA with 2 extra silent mutations (mCdc20)
as the rescue construct (Figure 1C). In HeLa cells infected with control vector, and transfected
with duplex 1, more than 98% underwent prolonged arrest followed by death in mitosis. In

cells infected with retrovirus expressing mCdc20, and then transfected with duplex 1, 83%
went through mitosis with little or no delay (1.5 ± 0.9 hr, n=85), divided, did not die, and
continued to the next cell cycle (Figure 1D, bottom panel). The remaining 17% that still showed
prolonged arrest may not have been infected with the rescue construct. We conclude that the
robust arrest and cell death phenotype caused by duplex 1 is specific to knockdown of Cdc20.
Duplex 1 also efficiently knocked-down Cdc20 in four other cell lines we investigated below
(Figure 1E).
Cdc20 Knockdown Efficiently Kills Slippage-Prone and Apoptosis-Resistant Cancer Cells

We next systematically compared the ability to promote death during mitotic arrest between
Cdc20 knockdown and treatment with a mitosis-specific Kinesin-5 inhibitor, EMD534085
(Orth et al., 2008). We made this comparison in five solid-tumor derived cell lines: four were
selected from a larger panel tested previously so as to span the full range of death-sensitivity
when treated with anti-mitotic drugs (Shi et al., 2008); Bcl2 over-expressing HeLa cells were
added as a fifth line with a known mechanism of apoptosis resistance. Because individual cells
vary greatly in their kinetics of mitotic arrest and death during mitosis (Gascoigne and Taylor
2008, Orth et al., 2008), we quantified single cell behavior using time-lapse microscopy. Figure
2A–E shows death kinetics in individual cells by time-lapse phase-contrast imaging, where
death was scored by vigorous blebbing followed by cessation of all movement. Time of death
was normalized to time of mitotic entry, which was scored by cell rounding. Since both
Kinesin-5 and Cdc20 are thought to function only in mitosis, and death in both Kinesin-5
inhibitor and Cdc20 knockdown only occurred during or after mitotic arrest, normalizing so
that T=0 was the time of mitotic entry conceptually synchronizes all cells at the start of the
pro-death stimulus. These data compare four treatments: Lamin A/C siRNA alone (to control
for the toxicity of siRNA transfection), Kinesin-5 inhibitor plus Lamin A/C siRNA, Cdc20
siRNA, and Kinesin-5 inhibitor plus Cdc20 siRNA. A saturating concentration of Kinesin-5
inhibitor was used, so all drug-treated cells that entered mitosis arrested, and none succeeded
in executing cytokinesis. For Kinesin-5 inhibitor treatment, we observed some death in mitosis,
some slippage, and some death after slippage, in all lines. These data are reported separately
in Table 1. For simplicity, Figure 2A–E report kinetics of all death, whether it occurred before
or after slippage, as cumulative survival curves. For Cdc20 knockdown, we observed no
slippage. HeLa was the most death-sensitive in our previous profiling experiment (Shi et al.,
2008). In this line, > 90% of cells died during mitotic arrest for all treatments except control
siRNA alone, and death kinetics were similar in each case (Figure 2A). In moderately resistant
MDA-MB-435S, 15% cells slipped out of Kinesin-5 inhibitor-induced mitotic arrest and
survived, and in highly resistant MCF7 and A549, ~80% slipped and survived (blue lines in
Figures 2B, 2C and 2D; Table 1). In each of these lines, knockdown of Cdc20 prevented
slippage, whether Kinesin-5 inhibitor was present or not. All Cdc20 knocked-down cells
remained arrested in mitosis for the whole time course, and all eventually died (red and green
lines in Figures 2B, 2C and 2D).
The molecular origin of death resistance in MCF7 and A549 is incompletely understood. To
compare Cdc20 knockdown to Kinesin-5 inhibitor in cells where we know the origin of death
resistance, we used a HeLa line that stably over-expresses Bcl2. Bcl2 antagonizes MOMP, and
over-expression of Bcl2 and related family members has been widely implicated in apoptosis
resistance in cancer (Letai, 2008). More than 70% of HeLa cells over-expressing Bcl2 slipped
out of mitotic arrest induced by Kinesin-5 inhibitor, and survived (blue line in Figure 2E; Table
1), like the naturally death-resistant cancer lines. Cdc20 knockdown again prevented slippage,
and killed all cells that entered mitosis (red and green lines in Figure 2E), though this took ~2.5
fold longer in time on average than normal HeLa (compare red and green lines in Figure 2A
and 2E).

These data allow several conclusions: First, Cdc20 knockdown efficiently promotes death
during mitotic arrest. In lines that tend to die inside mitosis in Kinesin-5 inhibitor, Cdc20
knockdown is equally effective at promoting death, but in lines that tend to slip before they
die, it is much more effective. Second, because Cdc20 knockdown blocks slippage, these data
allow us to compare the rate of death induction during mitotic arrest among the lines, without
the complication of slippage. The median times for induction of death in Cdc20 knockdown
were: HeLa 18.0 hr, MDA-MB-435S 24.3 hr, MCF7 39.8 hr, A549 40.0 hr, HeLa overexpressing Bcl2 40.8 hr. Thus, death induction rates during mitotic arrest were ~2.5 fold faster
in the most death-sensitive line compared to the most resistant. This relatively small difference
in death induction rate translates into a much larger difference in survival in Kinesin-5 inhibitor
(~0% in HeLa compared to >70% in MCF7, A549 and HeLa over-expressing Bcl2) because
slippage intervenes to rescue the slower-dying lines, as proposed in the competing pathway
model (Gacoigne and Taylor, 2008). Finally, in HeLa cells Bcl2 over-expression confers strong
resistance to Kinesin-5 inhibitor, but not to Cdc20 knockdown.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We next extended the comparison to paclitaxel, a drug with proven activity in solid tumors
(Jordan and Wilson, 2004). Again, we used a drug concentration that was saturating for mitotic
arrest and failure of cytokinesis in all lines, to avoid complications from drug efflux pump or
tubulin isotype differences. Across the panel, addition of Cdc20 knockdown to paclitaxel was
always as, or more, efficient than paclitaxel alone at inducing cell death (Figure 2F–J). In some
lines, paclitaxel is more pro-apoptotic than Kinesin-5 inhibitor. The duration of mitotic arrest
was essentially the same for both drugs in all lines, and the extra cell death in paclitaxel
manifested mostly after slippage (Table 1; Shi et al, 2008). In the more death-sensitive lines
(HeLa, MDA-MB-435S), paclitaxel and Kinesin-5 inhibitor caused death with similar kinetics,
and Cdc20 knockdown killed with either the same (HeLa) or somewhat greater (MDAMB-435S) efficiency. Death-resistant MCF7 cells responded similarly to the two drugs, and
in this line Cdc20 knockdown killed with much greater efficiency than either drug. A549 cells
were killed more efficiently by paclitaxel than Kinesin-5 inhibitor, but Cdc20 knockdown was
yet more efficient. HeLa over-expressing Bcl2 was intermediate between MCF7 and A549.
Overall, while paclitaxel was somewhat more efficient at promoting killing than Kinesin-5
inhibitor in some apoptosis-resistant lines, Cdc20 knockdown was always more efficient than
either drug.

A priori, we do not expect Cdc20 knockdown to perturb spindle assembly or activate the SAC.
To test if Cdc20 knockdown perturbs spindle assembly, we imaged microtubules live in HeLa
stably expressing GFP-β-tubulin (Figure 3). We observed normal bipolar spindles early in the
arrest, which gradually became multi-polar and abnormal over hours. From these images, it
seems likely that the SAC is not activated early in the Cdc20 knockdown arrest, though it may
be activated later. Because combining Cdc20 knockdown and Kinesin-5 inhibitor showed
similar death kinetics to Cdc20 knockdown alone in all lines (red and green lines in Figure
2A–E), we used this combination in most subsequent experiments. By deliberately activating
the SAC, we removed the ambiguity of whether it was activated. Combination with drugs was
also more reliable for blocking slippage than Cdc20 knockdown alone in cell lines where
transfection efficiency was variable.
Cdc20 Knockdown Slows Cyclin B1 Proteolysis
To determine how Cdc20 knockdown prevents slippage, we imaged cells infected with
adenovirus expressing full-length cyclin B1 fused to EGFP (Bentley et al., 2007). We first
confirmed that our cyclin B1-EGFP expression did not affect normal mitosis, duration of druginduced mitotic arrest or kinetics of cell death (data not shown). In HeLa, where most cells
died in mitosis in Kinesin-5 inhibitor, cyclin B1 levels gradually decreased to 30–60% of the
starting value by the time of death (Figure 4A, n>30). In A549, where most cells slipped out

of arrest without dying in Kinesin-5 inhibitor, cyclin B1 levels slowly decreased, until they
were 0–10% of the level at the start of mitosis, when the cell slipped by morphological criteria
(Figure 4B, n>40). We observed considerable cell-to-cell variation in the shape and slope of
cyclin B1 decrease kinetics, as we might expect since slippage kinetics are highly variable from
cell to cell (Gascoigne and Taylor 2008, Orth et al., 2008), but slippage always correlated with
the time that cyclin B1 levels were reduced to 0–10% of their starting value. When Cdc20 was
depleted, cyclin B1 levels declined more slowly, especially in A549 (Figure 4B and 4D). In
this situation, each time course ended when the cell underwent death in mitosis, which occurred
on average 18.8 ± 7.3 hr (n=98) after mitotic entry in HeLa, and 43.8 ± 16.5 hr (n=101) in
A549. At this time, cyclin B1 levels were 50–90% of their mitotic entry value in HeLa, and
30–70% in A549. Similar results were found when we used HeLa and A549 lines stably
expressing full-length cyclin-B1-EYFP, suggesting that such degradation kinetics is not
specific to adenovirus-mediated expression of cyclin-B1-EGFP (Figure S1). We conclude that
Cdc20 knockdown stabilizes cyclin B1 levels during mitotic arrest more efficiently than SAC
activation via Kinesin-5 inhibition. This presumably explains why arrest is sustained for longer
in Cdc20 knockdown, which gives cells more time to die in mitosis. These data are also
consistent with a previous hypothesis that slippage is due to slow proteolysis of cyclin B1 by
leaky activity of the APC/CCdc20 - proteasome pathway even when SAC is active (Brito and
Rieder, 2006), though a potential complication is the recent observation that cyclin B1 turns
over with a half life of 1–2 hrs, so its gradual loss presumably reflects a balance between
synthesis and proteolysis (Nilsson et al., 2008). Other mitotic cyclins could potentially
contribute to Cdc20 knockdown-mediated mitotic arrest, since depletion of Cdc20 also
stabilizes other APC/CCdc20 substrates, for example cyclin A (Sigrist et al., 1995; Wolthuis et
al., 2008).
Death Induced by Cdc20 Knockdown Does Not Depend on SAC Activity

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Loss or weakening of SAC activity confers strong resistance to SAC-dependent anti-mitotic
drugs in various cancer cell lines (Taylor and McKeon, 1997; Shin et al., 2003; Tao et al.,
2005; Swanton et al., 2007; Gascoigne and Taylor, 2008; Bekier et al., 2009). To test if Cdc20
knockdown can efficiently kill SAC-deficient cells, we knocked down individual SAC proteins
in HeLa cells by siRNA transfection, testing Mad2, BubR1, Mps1 and Bub3 (Figure 5A).
Mad2, BubR1 and Bub3 are present in the mitotic checkpoint complex (MCC) that sequesters
Cdc20, and Mps1 is an essential kinase in the SAC pathway (Musacchio and Hardwick,
2002; Musacchio and Salmon, 2007). Each knockdown drastically decreased the duration of
mitotic arrest in Kinesin-5 inhibitor, confirming that SAC activity was removed (Figure 5B).
Next, we co-knocked down Cdc20 with individual SAC proteins. To avoid competition
between siRNA duplexes, HeLa cells were first transfected with Mad2, BubR1, Mps1 or Bub3
siRNA, followed by a second transfection 6 hr later with Cdc20 siRNA. Immunoblots
confirmed the efficiency of co-knockdown (Figure 5A).
The robust mitotic arrest induced by Cdc20 knockdown was unaffected by co-knockdown of
any of the SAC proteins (Figure 5B), confirming that the arrest was SAC-independent, as
expected from a linear topology of the mitotic arrest pathway (Figure 1A). We then compared
the effects of SAC protein knockdown on death induced by Kinesin-5 inhibitor with that
induced by Cdc20 co-knockdown. Death induced by Kinesin-5 inhibitor in HeLa cells was
greatly attenuated by knockdown of SAC proteins (Figure 5C), consistent with the view that
SAC activity is required for cell killing by conventional spindle-perturbing drugs. Death
induced by Cdc20 co-knockdown, in contrast, was unaffected by knockdown of any of the four
SAC proteins investigated (Figure 5C). To test if this result is cell type dependent, we knocked
down Mad2 in the other three lines (Figure 5D). While mitotic arrest and cell death induced
by Kinesin-5 inhibitor were sensitive to ablation of Mad2 in all cases, those induced by coknockdown of Cdc20 were not (Figure 5E and 5F). In each case, death kinetics during mitotic

arrest in the absence of Mad2 (Figure 5E) were similar to those in its presence (Figure 2).
Similar results were obtained when paclitaxel was used as the anti-mitotic drug (Figure S2A–
D). We conclude Cdc20 knockdown is equally effective at killing SAC-competent and SACdeficient cancer cells, or phrased differently, death induced by knockdown of Cdc20 are SACindependent.
Cdc20 Knockdown Induces Death by MOMP and non-MOMP pathways

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Anti-mitotic drugs that work through SAC activation are thought to trigger cell death mainly
via the intrinsic, or mitochondrial apoptosis pathway, where the committed step is mitchondrial
outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP) (Wang et al., 1999; Park et al., 2004; Tao et al.,
2005; Bergstralh and Ting, 2006; Letai 2008). To confirm this, and to score activation of this
pathway in live cells, we generated stable cell lines expressing a previously validated live-cell
reporter for MOMP, IMS-RP (Albeck et al., 2008). IMS-RP was created by fusing RFP to the
mitochondrial import sequence of Smac (residue 1-59) (Albeck et al., 2008). MOMP during
mitotic arrest was evident in HeLa-IMS-RP cells treated with Kinesin-5 inhibitor: After many
hours of arrest, IMS-RP relocalized abruptly from a punctate, mitochondrial distribution to a
smooth, cytosolic distribution. 10–30 min later (our accuracy was limited by the time-lapse
interval), cells initiated vigorous blebbing, followed by complete cessation of movement that
we scored as cell death (Figure S3A, n>50). When Bcl2, a negative regulator of MOMP, was
over-expressed in death-sensitive HeLa-IMS-RP cells, MOMP was prevented as expected. In
cells arrested in Kinesin-5 inhibitor, IMS-RP remained its punctate mitochondrial distribution,
and cells eventually slipped out of arrest with mitochondria intact, and survived until the end
of the experiment (Figure S3B, n>30). These observations confirm that death during mitotic
arrest induced by Kinesin-5 inhibitor in HeLa occurs by the intrinsic, MOMP-dependent
apoptotic pathway. MOMP also did not occur during mitotic arrest in naturally death-resistant
A549-IMS-RP cells. Most of these cells slipped, survived, and went on to attempt another
round of division with mitochondria intact (Figure S3C, n>50).
We used the MOMP reporter to address whether Cdc20 knockdown also causes cell death by
intrinsic apoptosis. In HeLa-IMS-RP cells knocked-down for Cdc20, MOMP during mitotic
arrest was unambiguously scored by eye 10–30 min prior to morphological cell death (Figure
6A, n>50). As an unbiased check on this visual observation, we measured standard deviation
of the pixel intensity of the MOMP reporter, and found that it dropped sharply prior to death,
as the probe dispersed through the cytoplasm (Figure 6B). In A549-IMS-RP cells knockeddown of Cdc20, MOMP was also triggered after extended mitotic arrests (Figure S3D, n>40).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

HeLa cells over-expressing Bcl2 were also efficiently killed by Cdc20 knockdown (Figure
2E). Since MOMP is strongly inhibited in these cells, we wondered if this death, which occurred
~2.5 fold more slowly than in wild-type HeLa, was still correlated with MOMP. By eye, we
observed many cases where the reporter appeared to remain punctate as a cell died during
mitotic arrest. To quantify this, we defined MOMP-uncorrelated death by failure to detect a
sharp decrease in standard deviation of whole-cell IMS-RP pixel intensity 0–1 hr before
initiation of gross morphological change leading to death in the phase-contrast channel. More
than 80% HeLa over-expressing Bcl2 underwent MOMP-uncorrelated death by this criterion
(Figure 6C and 6D, n>40). The remaining 20% were either MOMP-correlated, or ambiguous.
Combining these data, when MOMP was allowed, all death events caused by prolonged mitotic
arrest, including the unusually long arrest required to kill resistant A549 cells in Cdc20
knockdown, were MOMP-correlated. When MOMP was blocked by over-expressing Bcl2 in
HeLa, cells died anyway, ~2.5 fold more slowly, but now the death was MOMP-uncorrelated,
and presumably occurred by a different pathway from intrinsic apoptosis.

An Alternative Method for Blocking Mitotic Exit Has Effects Similar to Cdc20 Knockdown

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To test if efficient, SAC-independent induction of death during mitotic arrest was specific for
Cdc20 knockdown, or a general consequence of blocking mitotic exit, we expressed human
cyclin B1 lacking its destruction box (residues 108-433), fused to EGFP at its C-terminus (CTcyclin-B1-EGFP) (Bentley et al., 2007). This mutant form of cyclin B1 is resistant to APC/Cmediated ubiquitination, and known to cause robust mitotic arrest (Wolf et al., 2006).
Immunoblots comfirmed expression of degradation-resistant cyclin B1 and increased level of
endogenous cyclin B1 in HeLa cells (Figure S4A). Expression of this mutant cyclin B1 caused
efficient mitotic blockade, and efficient cell killing, which was unaffected by RNAi knockdown
of SAC proteins (Figure S4B and S4C). We conclude that the precise mechanism by which
mitotic exit is blocked is not important for efficient killing of cancer cells.

DISCUSSION
Blocking Mitotic Exit versus Perturbing Spindle Assembly as Cancer Cell Killing
Mechanisms

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

All approved anti-mitotic drugs, which target microtubule dynamics, and most experimental,
spindle-specific drugs, work at least in part by activating the SAC (Jackson et al., 2007).
Possible exceptions are Aurora B kinase inhibitors, which inhibit aspects of the SAC as well
as damaging the spindle (Hauf et al., 2003). Several authors have hypothesized that reduced
SAC activity in some cancer cells, or increased slippage rate, may reduce sensitivity to killing
by spindle-perturbing drugs (Taylor and McKeon, 1997; Shin et al., 2003; Tao et al., 2005;
Swanton et al., 2007; Gascoigne and Taylor, 2008; Bekier et al., 2009). Our data support this
view, and further show that blocking cells in mitosis by a SAC-independent, slippage-resistant
mechanism can trigger death more effectively that a SAC-dependent drug. In death-resistant
lines, Cdc20 knockdown was much more effective than Kinesin-5 inhibition for promoting
cell death, while in death-sensitive lines the two treatments were similar. Two effects appear
to account for this difference: death was induced during mitotic arrest ~2 fold faster in sensitive
than resistant lines, and slippage occurred slightly more slowly in sensitive lines. Because
induction of death and slippage occur over similar time scales, and they appear to compete to
determine cell fate (as proposed by Gascoigne and Taylor, 2008), the net effect is a large
difference in total death in response to Kinesin-5 inhibitor, but only a 2-fold slowing of death,
with all cells eventually dying, in Cdc20 knockdown. We do not know how common the
phenotypes of fast slippage and/or slow apoptosis are in actual human tumors, but the fact that
we observed them in two of the four solid tumor derived lines tested suggests they may be
common. Perhaps this is one reason why spindle-specific drugs have shown only marginal
efficacy against solid tumors (Jackson et al., 2007).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The clinically proven drug paclitaxel causes additional post-slippage death compared to the
Kinesin-5 inhibitor we used in some cell lines, especially in A549 cells, despite promoting the
same duration of mitotic arrest (Figure 2 and Table 1; Shi et al., 2008). We do not have a clear
molecular explanation to account for this difference in death response; based on morphological
clues, we speculate it might come from micro-nucleation, or microtubule stabilization after
cells slip. Although execution of the death pathway is post-slippage, it requires a critical
duration of mitotic arrest; when we deliberately shortened the duration of arrest by knocking
down Mad2 in A549 cells, post-slippage death in paclitaxel was strongly inhibited (Figure 2I,
S2C and S2D). Although paclitaxel is better at promoting post-slippage death in some lines,
blocking mitotic exit downstream of the SAC was overall far more effective than either drug
at promoting death of cells that enter mitosis.

Cdc20 as a Potential Drug Target

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Cdc20 was discovered as an essential gene for cell cycle progression in budding yeast (Hartwell
et al., 1973), and was recently identified in dropout screens for genes that are required for
human cancer cell proliferation (Schlabach et al., 2008). Whether Cdc20 is absolutely required
for mitotic exit in human cells is still controversial (Li et al., 2007; Wolthuis et al., 2008;
Baumgarten et al., 2009). In this study, we showed that siRNA knockdown of Cdc20 causes
prolonged mitotic arrest in all lines tested, and it can be rescued by an RNAi-resistant transgene
in at least one line. This argues against the existence of APC-independent mitotic exit pathways
(Clarke, 2009).

Is Cdc20 is a “druggable target” in the sense that potent, specific small molecule antagonists
could be developed? The most obvious inhibition strategy would be a small molecule that binds
to APC/C and competes at the Cdc20 binding site, or vice versa. However, this may not be the
only option. MCC participates in complex interactions with various E3s and DUBs (enzymes
that add and remove ubiquitin) (Reddy et al., 2007; Stegmeier et al., 2007), and Cdc20 is
thought to undergo fast turnover during mitosis in some cells (Nilsson et al., 2008). Thus, it
might be possible to remove Cdc20 by antagonizing its translation or de-ubiquitination. A
negative for druggability of Cdc20 is that it must be almost completely inhibited (< 5% activity
remaining (Wolthuis et al., 2008)) to block mitotic exit, so mitotic arrest by Cdc20 inhibition
alone might require a potent inhibitor. However, Cdc20 inhibitors need not be used alone.
Combined with a conventional anti-mitotic drug, Cdc20 inhibitors should suppress slippage,
and thus potentiate cell killing.
Other proteins required for mitotic exit could also be considered as targets. Similar effects of
Cdc20 knockdown and degradation-resistant cyclin B1 expression suggest that any blockade
to mitotic exit will have the same lethal effect on cancer cells. One approach to finding a
druggable target in mitotic exit would be cell-based screening for mitotic arrest in cells where
the SAC has been ablated. SAC ablation would eliminate the large number of tubulin inhibitors
that dominate hits from conventional cell-based screens for mitotic arrest (Mayer et al.,
1999).
Implication for the Death Triggering Mechanism During Mitotic Arrest

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

A major unsolved question for anti-mitotic drugs is the molecular mechanism by which spindle
damage triggers death during mitotic arrest. One long-standing question is the SAC’s role in
this process (Taylor and McKeon, 1997; Shin et al., 2003; Tao et al., 2005; Swanton et al.,
2007; Gascoigne and Taylor, 2008; Bekier et al., 2009). Since mitotic arrest and SAC activation
are normally coupled, simply ablating the SAC and showing reduced apoptosis in drugs does
not distinguish whether the SAC triggers apoptosis directly, or only indirectly, by promoting
arrest (Weaver and Cleveland, 2005). We uncoupled arrest from SAC activation, by using
Cdc20 knockdown or degradation-resistant cyclin B1 expression, to promote a SACindependent mitotic arrest. We showed that death induction were unaffected by co-knockdown
of any of four SAC proteins investigated under these conditions (Figure 5C and S4B). This
suggests that some general feature of mitotic arrest, not the SAC activity, is the proximal trigger
for apoptosis.
With respect to identifying the pro-death (and pro-survival) signal during mitotic arrest, finding
that the SAC is not required for death is somewhat disappointing, since the SAC is a discrete
pathway involving a small number of proteins, while mitotic arrest is a broad change in cell
physiology that perturbs essentially every system in the cell. In death-sensitive HeLa cells, the
kinetics of cell death during mitotic arrest were the same for Cdc20 knockdown, two different
spindle-damaging drugs, and combinations of either drug with Cdc20 knockdown (Figure 2A
and 2F). This suggests that the strength of the signal is unaffected by the state of the mitotic

spindle, and is thus unlikely to emanate from any microtubule-based system. This signal seems
to be slowly cumulative, since long durations of arrest are required to trigger death, and to have
some memory, since death that depends on long mitotic arrest can occur several hours after
slippage. In most of the cells we studied, the signal eventually triggered MOMP, and blocking
MOMP by Bcl2 over-expression slowed death, suggesting the signal impinges on the Bcl2family circuitry that regulates MOMP (Letai 2008). However, it may act in others ways, since
Bcl2 over-expressing cells eventually died in mitotic arrest by a non-MOMP pathway, similar
to other situations where stressed cells die by alternative programmed death pathways when
the canonical apoptosis pathway is blocked (Degterev and Yuan, 2008). There is a large
literature on the molecular nature of the signal, suggesting the involvement of Bcl2, Bcl-xL
and caspase-9 phosphorylation, and various kinase signaling pathways including c-Jun Nterminal kinase (c-JNK), ERK, p38 MAP kinase, and AKT (Bacus et al., 2001; Salah-Eldin et
al., 2003; Basu and Haldar, 2003; Deacon et al., 2003; Allan and Clarke, 2007; Mhaidat et al.,
2007; Kim et al., 2007). However, no clear and general picture has yet emerged, and it remains
an area of intensive study. We speculate that this cumulative, death-inducing signal is generated
by one or more of the general changes in cell physiology that occur during mitosis, for example
in membrane organization, transcription, translation, metabolism or signaling. Elucidating this
signal will be challenging, but knowing its precise nature is not required to harness it for killing
cancer cells that enter mitosis, either by SAC activation for current drugs, or by blocking mitotic
exit as we propose.

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Cell Lines and Drugs
HeLa, MDA-MB-435S, MCF7, A549 and 293 cells were cultured according to ATCC
recommendations. HeLa GFP-β-tubulin line was a gift from Paul Chang, and HeLa Bcl2 overexpression line was a gift from Peter Sorger. Reference spindle-perturbing drugs were used at
concentrations that are saturating for mitotic arrest (Shi et al., 2008; Orth et al., 2008):
EMD534085 (European patent number WO2005063735, provided by Merck Serono) at 1
μM, and paclitaxel (Sigma) at 200 nM.
siRNA

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To deplete Cdc20, Ambion Silencer Select siRNA against Cdc20 (s2748) (duplex 1) was used
in all experiments at a final concentration of 50 nM; Dharmacon ON-TARGETplus siRNA
duplex against Cdc20 (J-003225-14) was used as an alternative (duplex 2) at 100 nM. To
deplete SAC proteins, Dharmacon siGENOME or ON-TARGETplus duplexes against Mad2
(J-003271-13), BubR1 (D-004101-04), Mps1 (D-004105-03), and Bub3 (D-006826-01) were
used at 40 nM. Dharmacon Lamin A/C siRNA duplex was used as controls. siRNA transfection
was performed using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) or HiPerFect (Qiagen) according to
manufacturer’s instructions.
Plasmids and Virus Production
Two extra silent mutations were introduced to mouse Cdc20 cDNA (Open Biosystems) in the
area corresponding to human Cdc20 siRNA duplex 1 by PCR mutagenesis. The PCR oligos
used are: CGAAATCCGGAATGACTACTATTTGAATCTTGTAGATTGGAGC and
GCTCCAATCTACAAGATTCAAATAGTAGTCATTCCGGATTTC. Mouse Cdc20 mutant
was subcloned into pBabe-puro retroviral expression vector. Retroviral IMS-RP and full-length
cyclin-B1-EYFP construct were gifts from Peter Sorger and Jagesh Shah, respectively.
Retrovirus was produced in 293 cells and used to infect HeLa or A549 cells to create stable
lines as described (Zheng and Cantley, 2007). Adenoviruses expressing vector-EGFP, fulllength cyclin-B1-EGFP and CT-cyclin-B1-EGFP were gifts from Randy King and amplified
in 293 cells as described (Hoyt and King, 2005).

Immunoblot Analysis

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Cell lysates in LDS sample buffer (NuPAGE, Invitrogen) were resolved on 12 Tris-HEPES
gels (Pierce) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Immunoblotting was performed
according to manufacturers’ recommendations using enhanced chemiluminescence
(Amersham). Antibodies against Cdc20 and Bub3 were purchased from Abcam; Mad2, BubR1,
tubulin and actin from Sigma; Mps1 from Upstate; cyclin B1 from Lab Vision.
Time-Lapse Imaging
Cells were seeded in glass-bottom plates (MatTek) in CO2-independent medium (Invitrogen)
supplemented with 10 FBS, 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. For fluorescent
time-lapse imaging cells were seeded in phenol red-free CO2-independent medium
(Invitrogen). Image acquisition was performed using Nikon TE2000 automated inverted
microscope with a 20 objective enclosed in a humidified incubation chamber maintained at 37
°C. Images were collected every 10–30 min using a motorized stage. Images were viewed and
analyzed using MetaMorph software (Molecular Dynamics).

was measured by time-lapse microscopy. Numbers in parentheses indicate n. Error bars
represent SD.
(C) Knockdown of SAC proteins attenuates Kinesin-5 inhibitor-induced death, but has no
effect on death induced by co-Cdc20 knockdown. HeLa cells were treated as described in (B),
and cumulative survival curves were plotted as a function of time since mitotic entry.

(D) Knockdown of Mad2 and co-knockdown with Cdc20. MDA-MB-435S, MCF7 and A549
cells were transfected with siRNA duplexes, and cell lysates were immunoblotted as indicated.
(E) Knockdown of Mad2 abrogates Kinesin-5 inhibitor-induced arrest, but has no effect on
arrest extended by Cdc20 co-knockdown. MDA-MB-435S, MCF7 and A549 cells were treated
and analyzed as described in (B). Instead of Cdc20 siRNA transfection alone, Kinesin-5
inhibitor was added 12 hr after transfection to improve efficiency of mitotic arrest. Numbers
in parentheses indicate n. Error bars represent SD.
(F) Knockdown of Mad2 attenuates Kinesin-5 inhibitor-induced death, but has no effect on
death induced by Cdc20 co-knockdown. MDA-MB-435S, MCF7 and A549 cells were treated
and analyzed as described in (C). Mad2 was used as a representative SAC protein, and
Kinesin-5 inhibitor combined with Cdc20 knockdown was used instead of Cdc20 knockdown
alone to improve efficiency of mitotic arrest.

Figure 6. Knockdown of Cdc20 induces MOMP and non-MOMP death

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

HeLa or HeLa Bcl2 over-expressing cells stably expressing IMS-RP, a red fluorescent protein
targeted to the inter-membrane space of mitochondria, was used to monitor MOMP. MOMP
can be observed from the fluorescence channel, showing a transition from punctate to smooth
distribution of IMS-RP. In addition, abrupt decrease in the SD of whole-cell IMS-RP
fluorescence intensity (normalized by the highest value) was used to validate MOMP. Time
of MOMP is indicated as “MOMP”, and time of morphological death is indicated as D.
Numbers indicate elapsed time (hour: minute) relative to mitotic entry. *To avoid extensive
photo-bleaching, cells are pre-arrested in mitosis by knockdown of Cdc20 before the start of
time-lapse imaging (T=0).
(A) Phase-contrast and IMS-RP time-lapse sequence of a representative HeLa cell transfected
with Cdc20 siRNA (shown in blue in (B)). Scale bar: 5 μm.
(B) Time course of IMS-RP standard deviation from 3 representative HeLa cells transfected
with Cdc20 siRNA.
(C) Phase-contrast and IMS-RP time-lapse sequence of a representative HeLa Bcl2 overexpresser transfected with Cdc20 siRNA (shown in blue in (D)). Scale bar: 5 μm.
(D) Time course of IMS-RP standard deviation from 3 representative HeLa Bcl2 overexpressers transfected with Cdc20 siRNA.
