Abstract
Wnt/b-catenin signaling underlies the pathogenesis of a broad range of human cancers, including the deadly
plasma cell cancer multiple myeloma. In this study, we report that downregulation of the tumor suppressor
microRNA miR-30-5p is a frequent pathogenetic event in multiple myeloma. Evidence was developed that miR30-5p downregulation occurs as a result of interaction between multiple myeloma cells and bone marrow
stromal cells, which in turn enhances expression of BCL9, a transcriptional coactivator of the Wnt signaling
pathway known to promote multiple myeloma cell proliferation, survival, migration, drug resistance, and
formation of multiple myeloma cancer stem cells. The potential for clinical translation of strategies to reexpress miR-30-5p as a therapeutic approach was further encouraged by the capacity of miR-30c and miR-30
mix to reduce tumor burden and metastatic potential in vivo in three murine xenograft models of human
multiple myeloma without adversely affecting associated bone disease. Together, our ﬁndings offer a preclinical
rationale to explore miR-30-5p delivery as an effective therapeutic strategy to eradicate multiple myeloma cells
in vivo. Cancer Res; 74(6); 1801–13. 2014 AACR.

Introduction
Multiple myeloma is a cancer of plasma cells that accumulate in the bone marrow. Despite recent advances in understanding the molecular pathogenesis of multiple myeloma and
the unveiling of promising new therapies, it remains incurable,
highlighting the need for continual efforts to develop novel and
hopefully more effective therapies (1, 2).
The canonical Wnt/b-catenin pathway is implicated in the
pathogenesis of a broad range of cancers, and has emerged
as a promising target for therapy. Loss-of-function mutations in APC and Axin as well as activating mutations in
b-catenin itself, enable b-catenin nuclear translocation, and
drive oncogenic Wnt transcription (3). Coactivators for
b-catenin transcription have been identiﬁed, including PygoAuthors' Afﬁliations: 1Department of Medical Oncology; 2Jerome Lipper

pus (PYGO), B-cell lymphoma 9 (BCL9), and its homolog Bcell lymphoma 9-like (B9L), among others (4, 5). The formation of a quaternary complex consisting of TCF, b-catenin, BCL9 (or B9L), and PYGO enhances b-catenin–dependent transcriptional activity (6).
The canonical Wnt pathway is constitutively active in
multiple myeloma and promotes tumor cell proliferation
and disease progression (7–11); however, mutations in APC,
Axin, or b-catenin have not been reported (12). Instead, the
mechanism of pathologic Wnt signaling in multiple myeloma has been linked to posttranscriptional regulation of
b-catenin (13) and/or increased levels of BCL9, implicating
this b-catenin cofactor as a bona ﬁde oncogene (9). The
oncogenic role of BCL9 is further highlighted by the following observations: human BCL9 was ﬁrst identiﬁed by cloning
the t(1;14)(q21;q32) translocation from a patient with B-cell
acute lymphoblastic leukemia (14); chromosome 1q21
ampliﬁcations containing the BCL9 locus are observed in
a broad range of human cancers (15), including multiple
myeloma, and is associated with poor clinical outcome (8);
shRNA-induced knockdown of BCL9 or treatment with
stabilized a-helix of BCL9 (SAH-BCL9), which selectively
suppress Wnt transcription, elicit mechanism-based antitumor responses in colorectal cancer cells and multiple myeloma (9, 10). Collectively, these data indicate that targeting
the BCL9 component of aberrantly activated Wnt signaling
in cancer may attenuate invasion, metastasis, and resistance
to therapy, highlighting the importance of this pathway and
BCL9 for target drug discovery.

In previous studies, we found that BCL9 is overexpressed in a
large subset of patients with multiple myeloma (8, 9). However,
only a weak correlation was observed between BCL9 DNA copy
number gains and BCL9 mRNA expression levels in patient
multiple myeloma cells (Supplementary Fig. S1A), indicating
that mechanisms other than gene dosage because of chromosome1q21 ampliﬁcation may be involved in regulating expression of BCL9 in multiple myeloma.
MicroRNAs (miRNA) function as negative regulators of gene
expression (16) and have been implicated in the pathogenesis
of multiple myeloma (17) and other cancers (18), offering the
promise to create novel therapeutic approaches if they can be
effectively applied in vivo. However, a functional link between
miRNAs and the Wnt pathway and its clinic and pathologic
signiﬁcance has not been established. Here, we document for
the ﬁrst time that expression of BCL9 is regulated by the miR30s family. miR-30s are expressed at very low levels in a large
subset of the multiple myeloma samples compared with
normal plasma cells, and there is a reverse relation between
miR-30s and BCL9 mRNA expression levels. Bioinformatics
analysis revealed that BCL9 mRNA has two different binding
sites for miR-30s in the 30 -untranslated region (30 UTR).
Enhanced expression of miR-30s in multiple myeloma cell
lines leads to a reduction in cellular proliferation, survival,
migration, and invasion as well as colony formation and
number of side population cells. These changes were mediated
through direct binding of miR-30s to the 30 UTR of BCL9 mRNA,
thereby downregulating BCL9 and Wnt transcriptional activity. Overall our studies establish a functional link between miR30s and BCL9, unveiling their role in multiple myeloma progression and providing a proof-of-concept for the potential
translation of miR-30s as novel therapeutic agent to target
oncogenic Wnt/b-catenin/BCL9 complex in multiple myeloma
and other cancers with deregulated Wnt activity.

Materials and Methods
Patients' tissue preparation and cell lines
Bone marrow specimens were obtained from patients
with multiple myeloma and normal donors in accordance
with Dana-Farber Cancer Institute Review Board approval,
and informed consent performed in compliance with the
Declaration of Helsinki. Multiple myeloma and normal plasma cells were puriﬁed from bone marrow aspirates using
CD138 magnetic beads (Miltenyi Biotec) as described (19).
CD138 negative mononuclear cells were used to establish
long-term bone marrow stem cells (BMSC). Stable stroma
cell line HS-5 was infected with V-ds-red and sorted to
generate a stable cell line for coculture experiments. After
a conﬂuent layer of adherent cells was obtained, the cells
were ready for coculture experiments and dexamethasone
drug treatment experiments. Multiple myeloma cell lines:
H929, MM1S, and RPMI8226 were obtained from American
Type Culture Collection, OPM1, and MR20 kindly provided
by Dr. T. Hideshima. All of the cells were routinely used and
tested using Human Cell Line Genotyping System (Promega)
when we frozen and thaw the cells. Cells were grown in
RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum,
in 5% CO2 in humidiﬁed air at 37 C.

Quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR, Western blot,
immunoﬂuorescence, immunohistochemistry, and
miRNAs locked nucleic acid in situ hybridization
miRNAs quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR (qRT-PCR)
was performed according to manufacturer's instruction
(Applied Biosystem). U44 primer from ABI was used as an
internal control. qRT-PCR was performed for evaluation of
BCL9 mRNA levels as previously described (9, 20), and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) served as an
internal control. The primers of BCL9, Axin-2, and CD44 are
listed in Supplementary Table S1. Western blot, miRNAs-LNA
in situ hybridization, immunoﬂuorescence, and immunohistochemistry (IHC) were carried out as previously described
(21). Antibodies included: BCL9 (6109) antibody for Western
blotting and immunoﬂuorescence (10); Alexa Fluor 546 goat
anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G (IgG; A-11010; Invitrogen) as
secondary antibody for immunoﬂuorescence; as well as actinhorseradish peroxidase (HRP; C-11; Santa Cruz) and antiRabbit IgG HRP conjugated secondary antibodies (W401b;
Promega) for Western blotting; as well as BCL9 (ab37305;
Abcam), caspase-3 (#9662; Cell Signaling Technology), Ki-67
(NB110-90592; Novus), Axin-2 (#2151; Cell Signaling), CD44
(#5640s; Cell Signaling), and BCL6 (ab9479; Abcam) were used
for IHC.
Lentiviral infection of miRNAs and transient
transduction of mature miRNAs
Expression plasmids of miR-30s were purchased from SBI
and referred to as V-miR-30s. The construct expresses the premiR-30s, which is processed into mature miRNAs in infected
cells. Lentiviral packaging and infection of multiple myeloma
cells were done according the protocol from manufacturer
(SBI). Multiple myeloma cells were infected with viral supernatant containing polybrene, and GFP-expressing cells sorted
by FACS. RPMI-8226, H929, and MM1S-Luc-neo cells were
transiently transduced with either mature miR-30a/b/c/d/e,
miR-30c only, or control cel-miR-67 (IDT) using Lipofectamine
2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Cel-miR-67 has minimal sequence identity with miRNAs in
human, mouse, and rat (sequence is listed in Supplementary
Table S1). Following transduction of cells, BCL9 immunoblots
were performed.
20 -O-methyl oligoribonucleotides for knockdown of miR30s and Bcl9 30 UTR luciferase constructs
The knockdown of miR-30s family members in multiple
myeloma cells was achieved by transfection with antisense 20 O-methyl oligoribonucleotides (ASO) against miR-30s using
Lipofectamine 2000. Transfection complexes were prepared
according to manufacturer's instructions and added directly to
the cells at a ﬁnal oligonucleotide concentration of 10 nmol/L.
The sequences of ASO against miR-30s and scrambled miR-30s
are listed in Supplementary Table S1. Following 48-hour incubation, cells were assayed for BCL9 mRNA and protein expression as described (9). pmiR-Report-Bcl9 were created by cloning Bcl9 30 UTR 329–335 and 486–492 bp, which match the seed
sequence of miR-30s into downstream luciferase gene of pmiR
reporter plasmid (pmiR-0), as we previously described (20).

miR-30 as a Novel Therapeutic Tool for Multiple Myeloma

Their mutants (e.g., pmiR-Report-BCL9-mut-1 and pmiRReport-BCL9-mut-2) were obtained by deletion of the matching seed sequence to indicated nucleotides (Fig. 2A). The
sequences used to create these plasmids are listed in Supplementary Table S1.
BCL9 30 UTR luciferase reporter assay and TOP/FOP
luciferase assay
Luciferase activity was measured using the Dual Luciferase
Reporter Assay System (Promega). 293T cells were cotransfected with miRNAs virus (V-miR-30s or V-GFP), reporter
plasmids, and Renilla luciferase using lipofectamine 2000
(Invitrogen). Twenty-four-hour posttransfection, cells were
subjected to luciferase reporter assay using Dual-Luciferase
Reporter Assay System (Promega). Luciferase activities were
analyzed as activity of ﬁreﬂy relative to Renilla. To measure
Wnt reporter activity, H929 and MM1S cells were transfected
with TOP-FLASH, FOP-FLASH plasmid (Millipore Corporation), along with an internal Renilla control plasmid (hRL-null),
according to the manufacturer's protocol. The results were
normalized to control Renilla activity. The reported data
represent the average of three independent transfection
experiments performed in triplicate.
The MM1S-Luc-neo tumor dissemination mouse model
NOD/SCID mice were injected intravenously with 5  106
MM1S-Luc-neo cells, and 1 week after injection, groups of eight
mice were randomly separated and treated by intraperitoneal
injection once a week with RNA-LANCErII (BioScience; vehicle) or 100 pmol total of an echymolar mixture of miR-30a/b/c/
d/e (miR-30 mix) premixed in RNA-LANCErII. Tumor development was monitored by whole body imaging using Xenogen
system. Mice were evaluated every week after initiation of
treatment, and the tumor ratio of ﬂuorescence intensity was
compared among the two groups. Fluorescent tissues were
harvested for histologic and IHC evaluation. To exclude toxic
effects of miR-30s therapy, nonﬂuorescent tissue were also
evaluated by histopathology. At day 21 of treatment, two mice
from control and treated groups were euthanized and their
spines subjected to microcomputed tomographic analysis.

Results
miR-30s is the only predicted miR binding to the 30 UTR of
BCL9 mRNA
We investigated whether BCL9 mRNA expression is regulated by miRNAs. By searching databases TargetScan (22),
PicTar (23), miRDB, and microCosm, we found that the
30 UTR of BCL9 mRNA contains 2 sequence motifs designated
wt-1 (9129–9135 bp) and wt-2 (9880–9886 bp; Supplementary
Fig. S1B), which perfectly match with the "seed" sequence of
the miR-30s family members (Supplementary Fig. S1C and
Fig. 2A).
miR-30s are downregulated in multiple myeloma cells,
and their expression is inversely related with BCL9
expression
Our expression proﬁling data from 78 patients with multiple
myeloma samples showed that the levels of each miR-30 family

www.aacrjournals.org

member (miR-30a/b/c/d/e) were variable, and that 60% (45/
78) of samples expressed low levels of miR-30s compared with 9
normal plasma cells (Fig. 1A). We next asked whether low levels
of miR-30s were associated with high BCL9 mRNA expression
levels, and vice versa using qRT-PCR analysis. A total of six
normal plasma cells (N1–N6) and six patient multiple myeloma
cells (T1–T6) were examined in parallel for expression of miR30s and BCL9 mRNA (Fig. 1B). We observed that normal plasma
cells with undetectable levels of BCL9 mRNA display high levels
of miR-30s expression, whereas patient multiple myeloma cells
with variable levels of BCL9 mRNA were almost devoid of miR30s expression. This inverse relation was also detected in
multiple myeloma cell lines (Fig. 1C). For example, the H929
cell line that expresses relatively low levels of miR-30s showed
high levels of BCL9 mRNA expression, whereas the MM1S cell
line that expresses high levels of miR-30s showed relatively low
levels of BCL9 mRNA expression. Although miR-30s members
are located at 3 different chromosomal regions: 1p34.2 (miR30e and miR-30c-1), 6q13 (miR-30c-2 and miR-30a), and
8q24.22 (miR-30b and miR-30d) they all have similar expression
patterns among different multiple myeloma patient samples
(Fig. 1A), suggesting that they share a similar regulatory
network that is independent of chromosomal copy number
alterations. Indeed miR-30c, the only member with two copies
in the human genome, does have the most abundant expression levels in normal plasma cells, and show the lowest levels of
expression in multiple myeloma patient samples, which frequently have chromosomal 1p34 and 6q13 deletions (24).
To further investigate the relation between BCL9 mRNA and
miR-30s levels, we analyzed the published dataset GSE17306
(25) in which information for both mRNA and miR expression
in multiple myeloma patient samples was available. We found
that BCL9 mRNA is highly expressed in late stage multiple
myeloma patient samples, and that its expression inversely
associated with expression of miR-30a (also known as miR-30a5p), miR-30b, miR-30c, miR-30d, and miR-30e (also known as
miR-30e-5p; P < 0.05; Fig. 1D), but not with miR-30a-3p and
miR-30e-3p, 2 miRNAs functionally unrelated to the miR-30s
family (P > 0.05, data not shown). In addition, we examined the
relation between miR-30s and BCL9 protein levels on bone
marrow biopsies. Because miR-30c showed the most signiﬁcant changes above (Fig. 1D), we selected this family member
for this and further studies. miR-LNA in situ hybridization of
miR-30c and IHC staining of BCL9 protein on 6 bone marrow
biopsies from patients with multiple myeloma also showed an
inverse association between miR-30s expression and BCL9
protein levels (Fig. 1E).
BCL9 mRNA is a direct target of miR-30s
To establish a functional relationship between miR-30s and
BCL9 mRNA regulation, we ﬁrst transduced individual premiR-30s into HEK293T cells using lentiviral vectors expressing
GFP as a marker for ﬂow sorting of stably transduction of
cells. Cells transduced with vector alone (V-GFP) were used
as a control. Ectopic expression of each miR-30s member (Fig.
2B) was associated with downregulated expression of BCL9
mRNA and protein levels, as evaluated by qRT-PCR (Fig. 2C)
and immunoblot analysis (Fig. 2D) respectively. To further

miR-30s regulates BCL9 mRNA expression in multiple
myeloma cells
We next investigated whether BCL9 mRNA expression is
regulated by miR-30s in multiple myeloma cells using both
gain- and loss-of-function studies. For gain-of-function studies,
we used H929 cells that express the lowest levels of miR-30s
among the multiple myeloma cell lines examined (Fig. 1C). We
ﬁrst induced ectopic expression of individual V-miR-30s family
members in H929 cells using lentiviral infection. After ﬂow
sorting of GFP positive cells, levels of miR-30s were veriﬁed by
qRT-PCR (Fig. 3A) and then used in all of the following experiments. As shown in HEK293T cells (Fig. 2B and C), ectopic
expression of miR-30c in multiple myeloma cells was also
associated with a signiﬁcant reduction in the expression of
BCL9 mRNA (Fig. 3B). Ectopic expression of miR-30s was also
associated with a reduction in the expression of BCL9 protein, as
evaluated by immunoblot (Fig. 3C) and immunoﬂuorescence
(Fig. 3D) studies. Consistent with the role of BCL9 as a transcriptional coactivator of the Wnt signaling pathway, ectopic
expression of miR-30c was also associated with reduced expression of "bona ﬁde" Wnt pathway downstream targets CD44 and

www.aacrjournals.org

Axin-2 (Fig. 3B; refs. 9 and 10) as well as Wnt reporter FOP/TOP
activity (Fig. 3E). We next focused on evaluating the effect of the
miR-30s family member miR-30c and validated its effect on
BCL9 downregulation in other multiple myeloma cell lines using
immunoblot (Supplementary Fig. S1D). Wild-type TOP reporter
activity was inhibited in V-miR-30c stable H929 cells compared
with V-GFP stable H929 cells, whereas the mutant FOP activity
was not changed (Fig. 3E). To exclude the possibility that the
observed changes in BCL9 expression may be because of
nonspeciﬁc and/or secondary effects of stable transfection of
V-miR-30c, we also performed transient transfection with
increasing amounts of mature miR-30c into RPMI8226 cells,
using cel-miR-67 as a control (Fig. 3F). To conﬁrm transfection
efﬁciency, cells were collected 72 hours after transfection, and
miR-30c expression levels were checked by qRT-PCR (Fig. 3F,
top). We found an inverse association between downregulation
of BCL9 protein expression and increasing amounts of transfected mature miR-30c (Fig. 3F bottom). To verify miR-30's
potential for therapy in patients with multiple myeloma,
CD138þ primary cells (n ¼ 3) were transfected with 40 pmol
of mature miR-30c or same amount of cel-miR-67 as control.
Expression of BCL9, CD44, and Axin-2 were downregulated as
evaluated by immunoﬂuorescence in all 3 patient samples. One
representative case is shown in Fig. 3G (top). Furthermore,
multiple myeloma cell proliferation was dramatically inhibited
by miR-30c (Fig. 3G, bottom).

10). Based on results shown in Fig. 1D and E, we focused on miR30c. A consistent pattern emerged whereby H929 and OPM1
cells overexpressing miR-30c (V-miR-30c), but not control cells
(V-GFP), showed signiﬁcantly reduced proliferation (Fig. 4A),
colony formation (Fig. 4B), invasion, and migration (Fig. 4C). In
addition, we found that miR-30c induces a modest increase in
apoptosis, from 10.1%  1.1% in H929 cells expressing GFP (VGFP) to 14.2%  1.9% in H929 cells expressing miR-30c (V-miR30c; n ¼ 3, P < 0.05; Fig. 4D). Taken together, these data
demonstrate that miR-30c speciﬁcally disrupts a series of physiologic processes regulated by the Wnt/BCL9/b-catenin transcriptional complex, and highlighting the potential therapeutic
role of miR-30c in multiple myeloma.
miR-30c inhibits multiple myeloma cancer stem cell
formation
We next investigated whether miR-30c is involved in regulating behavior of cancer stem cells (CSC) in multiple myeloma
(Fig. 5). Functional Hoechst 33342 staining assay was used to
deﬁne the side population in V-miR-30c stably infected cells,
and V-GFP cells were used as a control (Fig. 5A). The stem cell
side population was signiﬁcantly reduced from 0.698%  0.04%
in H929 V-GFP cells to 0.068%  0.05% in H929 cells expressing
V-miR-30c (n ¼ 3, P < 0.05; Fig. 5B). Moreover, in experiments
using stem cell medium to culture sorted side population cells
(Fig. 5C), the sphere numbers (Fig. 5D) and size of spheres as
evaluated by cell number per sphere (Fig. 5E), were signiﬁcantly decreased in H929 V-miR-30c side population compared
with H929 V-GFP control CSCs. These results highlight the
potential role of miR-30c in blocking the Wnt signaling pathway in CSC, further conﬁrming the relevance of this pathway
for target drug discovery in multiple myeloma.
miR-30c restores drug sensitivity in bone marrow stroma
cell-induced drug resistance of multiple myeloma
BMSCs promote migration, homing, proliferation, survival,
and drug resistance in multiple myeloma (26). The relatively
high levels of miR-30s in multiple myeloma cell lines compared
with patient multiple myeloma cells (Fig. 1B and C) prompted
us to next investigate the possible role of BMSCs in regulating
miR-30s expression in multiple myeloma cells. GFP-labeled
H929 cells were cocultured with HS-5 dsRed stable BMSCs.
After 48 hours of coculture, GFP-positive H929 cells were ﬂow
sorted and total RNA was isolated for qRT-PCR analysis. As
shown in Supplementary Fig. S3A, coculture with HS-5 dsRed
downregulates expression of miR-30s in H929 cells, associated
with enhanced expression of BCL9 mRNA and the Wnt downstream targets Axin-2 and CD44, but not of GAPDH, a non-Wnt
target gene used as a control (Supplementary Fig. S3B).
Because CD44 is a downstream target of Wnt/b-catenin/
BCL9 transcriptional complex (9, 10), miR-30c downregulates
expression of CD44 (Fig. 3B) in multiple myeloma cells, and
CD44 is a functional component of cell adhesion–mediated
drug resistance (CAM-DR; ref. 26), we investigated the possible
role of miR-30s in multiple myeloma drug resistance in the
context of bone marrow microenvironment. After ectopic
overexpression of miR-30c or miR-30a/b/c/d/e cocktail
(miR-30 mix) or a negative control (cel-miR-67) in H929 cells

(Supplementary Fig. S3C), we cocultured these cells alone or in
the presence of HS-5 cells for 48 hours and treated them with
200 nmol/L dexamethasone. Interestingly, we found that both
miR-30c and miR-30 mix can resensitize the H929 cells to
dexamethasone treatment with miR-30 mix apparently being
more effective than miR-30c (Supplementary Fig. S3D). Overall
these ﬁndings indicate that expression of miR-30s in multiple
myeloma cells can be modulated by the bone marrow microenvironment and further support its therapeutic potential to
overcome CAM-DR.

miR-30c inhibits tumor progression in murine xenograft
models of human multiple myeloma
To further explore the therapeutic potential of miR-30c, we
next examined its capacity to suppress tumor growth and
metastatic potential in vivo using 2 established murine xenograft models of human multiple myeloma (9). In the ﬁrst model
(i.e., subcutaneous), H929 V-GFP control and H929 V-miR-30c
stably transduced cells were injected subcutaneously into
opposite ﬂanks of SCID mice; tumor volume was evaluated
over time up to day 25, when mice were sacriﬁced and whole
body imaging was performed. As shown in Fig. 6A (top and
bottom), tumor growth was signiﬁcantly decreased in mice
injected with H929 V-miR-30c (green arrows) as compared
with H929 V-GFP control cells (red arrows). In the second
model (i.e., intravascular), H929 V-GFP control or H929 V-miR30c stably transduced cells were injected by tail vein into SCID
mice; survival, tumor burden, and spreading were assessed
(Fig. 6B). Tumor involvement was observed in the intestine,
spine, and skull, which was similar in V-miR-30c and V-GFP
control group (122.5  33.0 days vs. 162.2  21.7 days, n ¼ 6, P ¼
0.03; Fig. 6B, top). However, tumor burden was decreased and
survival was signiﬁcantly increased in mice injected with H929
V-miR-30c compared with H929 V-GFP control cells (Fig. 6B,

bottom). In agreement with our in vitro studies, tumors developing in mice injected with stable V-miR-30c H929 cells
showed decreased expression levels of BCL9, Ki-67, CD44, and
Axin-2 proteins, as well as increased levels of caspase-3 expression compared with V-GFP control tumors evidenced by IHC
analysis (Fig. 6C). BCL6 that is a target of miR-30 in diffuse large
B-cell lymphomas (27) was not identiﬁed in multiple myeloma
(Supplementary Fig. S1E). The miR-30c overexpression and
downregulation of BCL9 in GFP-positive harvested tumors was
further veriﬁed by qRT-PCR (Fig. 6D, top) and immunoblot
(Fig. 6D, bottom).
To further evaluate the possibility of translating this
biological proof-of-concept into a pharmacologic strategy
for inhibiting oncogenic Wnt/b-catenin/BCL9 complex
using miR-30s, we next determined whether intraperitoneal
delivery of miR-30s could inhibit multiple myeloma tumor
growth in vivo. To achieve therapeutic beneﬁts in vivo, miRbased drugs require trans-membrane delivery systems to
protect encapsulated miRNAs from degradation in the circulation, promote accumulation in target tissue, facilitate
intracellular delivery into target cells and must also be
relatively nontoxic. Lipid nanoparticles are currently the
most favored delivery system for satisfying these needs;

therefore, we used miR-30s premixed with RNA-LANCErII,
consisting of a mixture of neutral lipid, nonionic detergent,
and oil (28) to perform this in vivo experiment. We ﬁrst
evaluated if lipid nanoparticles could deliver miR-30s into
H929 multiple myeloma cells and if there was preferential
delivery and inhibition of BCL9 expression among individual
members of the miR-30s family. qRT-PCR analysis revealed
that all miR-30 members were taken up by the cells, although
at different extent when added to the medium individually
or as a miR-30a/b/c/d/e echymolar cocktail (miR-30
mix; Fig. 7A). In addition, all individual miR-30 members
or the echymolar cocktail decreased expression of BCL9 to

www.aacrjournals.org

similar extent, evaluated by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 7B).
Reasoning that treatment with a cocktail mixture containing
lower amounts of each individual member could be better
tolerated by the mice we performed this in vivo experiment
with miR-30 mix. Therefore, we ﬁrst investigated the speciﬁcity of miR-30 mix treatment in inhibiting expression of
Wnt/b-catenin/BCL9 transcriptional targets by performing
comparative genome-wide expression analyses (Fig. 7C). We
generated triplicate gene expression proﬁling datasets from
H929 cells treated with miR-30 mix or Cel-miR-67 (control)
as well as from H929 cells lentivirally transduced with
previously validated shRNA hairpins against BCL9 (sh-BCL9)

or scrambled sequences (control; ref. 9) using Afﬁmetrix
oligonucleotides microarrays. Gene set enrichment analysis
revealed a statistically signiﬁcant correlation between the
genes downregulated by miR-30 mix and by sh-BCL9 [familywise error P-value < 0.001; false discovery rate q-value <
0.001], documenting the speciﬁcity of miR-30 mix in blocking expression of Wnt/b-catenin/BCL9 transcriptional targets (Fig. 7C).
Then, we performed an in vivo miR-30 mix delivery
experiment to determine whether tumor growth is antagonized in a well-established MM1S-Luc-neo murine xenograft
model of human multiple myeloma (Fig. 7D–F) after intraperitoneal delivery using lipid nanoparticles. As shown
in Fig. 7D, survival was increased in mice treated with
miR-30 mix (vehicle group, 31.9  2.3 days vs. miR-30 mix
group, 35.7  4.4 days, n ¼ 8, P < 0.05), and associated with
decreased tumor burden (Fig. 7E), metastasis to the kidney
(Fig. 7F, top), as well as decreased expression of BCL9 and
CD44 proteins (Fig. 7F, bottom). In vivo delivery of miR-30s
to target cells was conﬁrmed using miRNA LNA-ISH (Fig. 7F
second row, bottom).
Because of the documented role of Wnt activity in bone
metabolism (29), and the potential side effect of worsening
osteolytic bone disease in patients with multiple myeloma
treated with Wnt inhibitors (30), we evaluated the effect of
miR-30s therapy in our murine xenograft model using microcomputed tomography (mCT) of bones. We ﬁrst evaluated
the effect of miR-30c in SCID mice no transplanted with
myeloma cells. No apparent development of bone osteolytic
lesions was observed in mice treated with miR-30c as
compared with mice treated with vehicle (Supplementary
Fig. S4A and S4B). We also evaluated by mCT analysis the
spines of 2 vehicle-treated and 2 miR-30 mix–treated SCID
mice transplanted with MM1S-Luc-Neo cells at day 21 of
treatment (Fig. 7D). As shown in Supplementary Fig. S4C and
S4D, no major differences in trabecular bone volume and
cortical void fraction was observed between mice treated
with vehicle or miR-30 mix. In addition, the cortical void
fraction of mice transplanted with multiple myeloma cells
and treated with miR-30 mix was similar to mice not
transplanted with multiple myeloma cells (Supplementary
Fig. S4B and Supplementary S4D). Furthermore, no evidence
of bone lytic lesions as evaluated histologically was observed
in long bones, which were not involved by multiple myeloma
cells (data not shown). Overall these results suggest that
miR-30s treatment does not have a negative impact on bone,
an issue that need to be further explored. Thus, miR-30s
treatment effectively inhibited BCL9-driven Wnt transcriptional activity in vivo, thereby suppressing tumor growth,
invasion, and enhancing survival, highlighting the potential

role of miR-30s as a novel therapeutic approach in multiple
myeloma. The lack of improvement in multiple myeloma–
associated bone disease in miR-30s treatment suggest that
this approach should be implemented in association with
therapies that reduce osteoclast-mediated bone resorption,
such as bisphosphonates (29).

Discussion
Here we provide evidence for a novel functional link
between miR-30s and oncogenic Wnt/b-catenin/BCL9 transcriptional activity. Using multiple myeloma as a model
cancer system with deregulated Wnt activity (7–11), we
proved that miR-30s is a tumor suppressor and novel therapeutic tool by targeting BCL9, a critical coactivator of the
canonical Wnt/b-catenin signaling pathway. Deregulated
Wnt/b-catenin transcriptional activity underlies the pathogenesis of a wide variety of human carcinomas (31, 32), and
hematologic malignancies, including multiple myeloma (7–
11). Although the Wnt/b-catenin transcriptional complex is a
promising target for cancer therapy (33), a major limitation to
therapies targeting this pathway is the importance of b-catenin activity in normal adult tissue homeostasis (34). Thus,
further investigation of novel and more selective Wnt signaling components are needed.
The BCL9 is an essential coactivator of Wnt/b-catenin
transcriptional activity, and studies from our lab and others
have unveiled its role as novel therapeutic target (9, 10). The
lack of detectable phenotypic alterations in the intestinal tract
of mice with conditional deletion of BCL9 and B9L (35)
suggests that BCL9/BL9 proteins do not play an essential
homeostatic role in mammalian Wnt signaling, although
BCL9/B9L regulates Wnt target genes that control epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and stem cell-like behavior (35).
These data indicate that targeting the BCL9/B9L component of
aberrantly activated Wnt signaling in cancer may attenuate
tumor spread, and resistance to therapy, while leaving normal
tissues relatively undisturbed. Indeed, treatment with SAHBCL9 peptide elicits mechanism-based antitumor responses in
vitro as well as in mouse xenograft models of colorectal cancer
and multiple myeloma without detectable alterations in host
tissues (10).
A link between miRNA-30c and BCL9 was recently documented in ovarian carcinoma (36). miR-30c (also called
miR-30c-3p) and miR-30c (also called miR-30c-5p) are related miRNAs processed from the same precursor but from
different regions denoted 3p and 5p, respectively, with
almost complementary sequences, indicating they have different target genes (37). Using 4 different target prediction
software algorithms we found that the 5p miR-30 family, but

not the 3p complementary family, matched with the 30 UTR
of BCL9 mRNA. Furthermore, our analysis of miRNAs and
mRNA expression arrays in multiple myeloma patient datasets showed that expression of the miR-30s-5p family, but
not the miR-30s-3p family, is inversely associated with BCL9
mRNA levels.
miR-30s also function as tumor suppressor genes in other
cancers: miR-30s are downregulated in diffuse large B-cell
lymphoma where BCL6 gene was identiﬁed as a target (27);
ectopic expression of miR-30s inhibits the self-renewal capacity of breast tumor–initiating cells by reducing Ubc9, and
induces apoptosis by silencing integrin-b3 (38); miR-30s regulate B-Myb expression, highlighting the pivotal role of miR30s in Rb-driven cellular senescence (39). Interestingly, we did
not ﬁnd changes in the expression of BCL6, Ubc9, and B-Myb in
multiple myeloma cells overexpressing miR-30c or miR-30 mix,
in accordance with the notion that the target of miRNAs are
tumor cell speciﬁc (40).
The small size of miRNAs makes them very attractive for
drug development in multiple myeloma (41–43). miRNAs are
natural antisense interactors and will not induce immune
response (44), and the expression levels of speciﬁc miRs
responds to physiologic stimuli (45) compare with other
Wnt inhitors (33). However, the success of miRNAs therapy
has hold upon the development of suitable in vivo delivery
systems. Because miR-30s plays its role as a tumor suppressor, and is expressed in all normal tissues, it is expected that
replacement therapy will not affect normal cell function. In
agreement with this scenario, we have observed that intraperitoneal delivery of miR-30 mix using lipid nanoparticles
increased survival in a murine xenograft model of human
multiple myeloma with lack of negative impact on normal
tissues as it has been observed with other Wnt inhibitors
(19, 33).
In conclusion, we have documented that downregulation of
the tumor suppressor miR-30s is a frequent pathogenetic event
in multiple myeloma, and provide evidence for a model in
which the interaction between multiple myeloma cells and
BMSCs decreases miR-30s levels in multiple myeloma cells,
which in turn enhances expression of BCL9, as a transcriptional coactivator of the Wnt signaling pathway, promotes

expression of downstream target genes involved in multiple
myeloma tumor cell proliferation, survival, migration, drug
resistance, and multiple myeloma CSC (Fig. 7G). The potential
for clinical translation of strategies using miR-30s as a novel
therapeutic tool is further conﬁrmed by the capacity of miR30c and miR-30 mix to reduce tumor burden and metastatic
potential in vivo in 3 murine xenograft models of human
multiple myeloma.
