Abstract
Trastuzumab shows remarkable efficacy in treatment of ErbB2-positive breast cancers when used alone or in
combination with other chemotherapeutics. However, acquired resistance develops in most treated patients,
necessitating alternate treatment strategies. Increased aerobic glycolysis is a hallmark of cancer and inhibition of
glycolysis may offer a promising strategy to preferentially kill cancer cells. In this study, we investigated the
antitumor effects of trastuzumab in combination with glycolysis inhibitors in ErbB2-positive breast cancer. We
found that trastuzumab inhibits glycolysis via downregulation of heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) and lactate
dehydrogenase A (LDH-A) in ErbB2-positive cancer cells, resulting in tumor growth inhibition. Moreover,
increased glycolysis via HSF1 and LDH-A contributes to trastuzumab resistance. Importantly, we found that
combining trastuzumab with glycolysis inhibition synergistically inhibited trastuzumab-sensitive and -resistant
breast cancers in vitro and in vivo, due to more efficient inhibition of glycolysis. Taken together, our findings
show how glycolysis inhibition can dramatically enhance the therapeutic efficacy of trastuzumab in ErbB2positive breast cancers, potentially useful as a strategy to overcome trastuzumab resistance. Cancer Res; 71(13);

Introduction
Trastuzumab (Herceptin; Genentech Inc.), a humanized
ErbB2-targeting monoclonal antibody, was the first successful
rational, targeted therapeutic agent approved for clinical use in
breast cancer patients (1, 2). Trastuzumab has shown remarkable
therapeutic efficacy when used either alone or in combination
with other chemotherapeutics to treat ErbB2-positive breast
cancer and other types of cancers (1, 3, 4). Several possible
mechanisms by which trastuzumab decreases ErbB2 signaling
include blockade of ErbB2 receptor dimerization, inhibition of
shedding of the extracellular domain, increase of endocytosis, and
activation of antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity

(ADCC; ref. 1). Previous studies showed that trastuzumab inhibits phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling by restoring
PTEN function (5) and PI3K inhibitors enhanced the antitumor
effect of trastuzumab in ErbB2-positive cancer cells (6, 7). Interestingly, in addition to be a major signaling pathway that regulates
cell survival, the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway also is a master
regulator of cancer cell bioenergetic metabolism (8). However, it
is unknown whether targeting cancer cell energy metabolism may
serve as a mechanism in trastuzumab-induced tumor inhibition.
Despite its initial efficacy, acquired resistance to trastuzumab develops in a majority of patients who have metastatic
breast cancer (5, 9, 10). Possible mechanisms of trastuzumab
resistance include altered interaction between trastuzumab
and its target receptor ErbB2, PTEN loss and increased PI3K
signaling, p27kip1 downregulation, and signaling through other
receptors (11). Trastuzumab has emerged as a very important
drug for ErbB2-positive breast cancer therapy, and multiple
clinical trials are currently being conducted to expand its
usage to more breast cancer patients and other types of
cancers (1, 12). Thus, understanding the mechanisms of
trastuzumab resistance and overcoming its resistance is an
urgent task for cancer researchers and clinicians. It has been
shown that bioenergetic alteration plays a role in chemoresistance (13), and targeting glycolysis sensitizes cancer cells to
chemotherapy (14). However, it is unknown whether the
switch of energetic dependency contributes to trastuzumab
resistance and whether targeting dysregulated cancer cell
metabolism may sensitize cancer cells to trastuzumab.
Warburg, in 1956, observed that most cancer cells take up
glucose at higher rates than normal cells but use a smaller

Effect" (15–23). Although the molecular mechanisms underlying the Warburg effect remain unclear, increased glycolysis in cancer cells has been well accepted to be an
important process to support malignant phenotypes (18).
By taking advantage of the unique metabolic feature of
cancer cells, several glycolysis inhibitors have shown to
preferentially inhibit cancer cells and spare normal cells
(24–26). A synthetic glucose analogue, 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2DG), is one of the glycolysis inhibitors that has been shown
to have effects in selectively inhibiting solid tumors and is
currently under phase I and II clinical trials (27–29).
Another promising glycolysis inhibitor, oxamate (OX), a
specific inhibitor of the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), has
also shown promising results and is currently under preclinical investigation (14, 30). However, many glycolytic
inhibitors have been evaluated after the discovery of the
Warburg effect, yet none of them are currently used in the
clinic. In addition, studies with xenografts indicated that as
a single agent, 2-DG did not significantly enhance tumor
cell killing (27). One plausible explanation is that when
glycolysis is blocked by glycolytic inhibitors, cancer cells
may survive the inhibition through other adaptation
mechanisms. Recently, 2 studies showed that 2-DG may
activate prosurvival pathways in cancer cells and treating
cancer cells with the combination of 2-DG and an IGFIR
inhibitor dramatically reduced cancer cell proliferation and
promoted apoptosis (31, 32), indicating that combination 2DG with other signaling inhibitors in a 2-DG–based therapy
may result in enhanced efficacy. Therefore, identifying
appropriate anticancer reagents to combine with glycolysis
inhibitors may hold the key for more efficient cancer cell
killing power for glycolysis inhibitors.
Our previous studies showed that the upregulation of LDHA by ErbB2 through heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) promotes
breast cancer cell glycolysis and growth (33). In this study, we
report that trastuzumab inhibits glycolysis via downregulation
of HSF1 and LDH-A in ErbB2-positive breast cancer cells,
which may provide a new mechanism of trastuzumab-induced
tumor inhibition. We also report that increased glycolysis
contributes to trastuzumab resistance and that glycolysis
inhibitors sensitize ErbB2-positive breast cancer cells to trastuzumab via downregulation of HSF1 and LDH-A. More
importantly, glycolysis inhibition resensitizes trastuzumabresistant cells to trastuzumab both in vitro and in vivo. These
novel findings have important implications for the future
development of therapeutics for ErbB2-positive and trastuzumab-resistant cancers.

cells were monthly tested for trastuzumab resistance.

production assay or 96-well plates for drug treatment. Fortyeight hours after transfection, cell lysates were prepared and a
Western Blot was carried out.

Stable HSF1-overexpressing BT474 cells
BT474 cells were transfected with pcDNA 3.1 (þ) or pcDNA
3.1 (þ) human wild-type (WT) HSF1 using Lipofectamine 2000
(Invitrogen). Twenty-four hours after plasmid transfection,
cells were cultured in medium containing 400 mg/mL G418 to
screen for stable clones.

Cell viability assay
Cells (3  103 to 5  103 cells/well) were placed in a 96well plate. Twenty-four hours later, cells were treated with
trastuzumab, 2-DG/OX, or trastuzumab þ 2-DG/OX at the
indicated concentration and incubated for the indicated time.
Cell viability was determined using a CellTiter 96 Aqueous One
Solution Cell Proliferation Assay Kit (Promega).

Glucose uptake assay
Cells were seeded in 12-well plates at 1  105 to 3  105 cells
per well. Culture media was collected at 48 hours and stored at
20 C until assayed. Glucose uptake was measured using an
Amplex Red Glucose/Glucose Oxidase assay kit (Molecular
Probes). Absorbance was measured at 563 nm using a SpectraMax M5 plate reader (Molecular Devices) and the results
were normalized to the amount of total protein.
Lactate production assay
Lactate production in the medium was detected by using a
Lactate assay kit (BioVision). Results were normalized to the
amount of total protein.
LDH activity assay
Tumors were extracted for protein and then, their LDH
activity was measured using an LDH assay kit (BioVision).
Results were normalized to the tumor weight.
Western blot
Western blot analyses were conducted as we did previously
(34). The following antibodies were used: HSF1 (4356; Cell
Signaling Technology), LDH-A (2012; Cell Signaling Technology), HKII (C64G5; Cell Signaling Technology), b-actin (A2228;
Sigma). Immunoreactive bands were visualized by horseradish
peroxidase–conjugated secondary antibodies (Bio-Rad) using
ECL Western Blotting Substrate (Pierce).

Cell counting
BT474 cells (1  105 cells/well) were seeded in 12-well
plates. After 24 hours, cells were treated with or without 100
mg/mL of trastuzumab for 24, 48, 72, and 96 hours. At different
time points, cell viability was measured by trypan blue staining and direct cell counting using hemocytometer.
Animal experiments
Female athymic nude mice (Harlan Sprague Dawley) were
implanted with 0.72 mg of 60 day release 17b-estradiol pellets
(Innovative Research of America). Three days later, BT474 and
BT474/TR cells (1  107) in 200 mL of PBS and Matrigel (BD
Biosciences) mixture (1:1) were injected subcutaneously into a
mouse mammary fat pad mfp. When the tumor reached a size
of greater than 150 mm3, the mice were randomly divided into
4 groups (8 mice per group) as follows: PBS-treated control;
trastuzumab alone [10 mg/kg intraperitoneal (i.p.), 2 times/wk
 3 weeks]; OX alone (750 mg/kg, i.p., daily for 21 days); and
trastuzumab þ oxamate. Mice were weighed weekly and
tumor diameters were measured with calipers twice per week
for more than 5 weeks. The tumor volumes were calculated
with the following formula: volume (mm3) ¼ W  L/2, where
W and L are the minor and major diameters (in millimeters),
respectively. Unpaired Student's t tests were used to assess
statistical significance.

Results
siRNA experiments
siRNAs for HSF1 and LDH-A and the control scrambled
siRNA were purchased from Sigma. The downregulation of
HSF1 was confirmed with 2 siRNA sequences to avoid offtarget effects. Transfection was carried out using the Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen).
Twenty-four hours after siRNA transfection, cells were

Targeting Glycolysis Sensitizes Breast Cancer to Trastuzumab

promotes glycolysis and increases the sensitivity of breast
cancer cells to glycolysis inhibitors such as 2-DG and OX (33).
On the basis of these studies, we hypothesized that the
combination of trastuzumab with a glycolysis inhibitor may
be more efficient than using the agents individually. We first
tested the hypothesis in ErbB2-positive BT474 breast cancer
cells and found that the combination of trastuzumab and 2DG (Fig. 1A, left) or OX (Fig. 1B, right) dramatically increased
the efficacy of trastuzumab to inhibit cell viability compared
with the use of agents individually. To evaluate whether the
combinational effect is synergistic or additive, viability data
generated from BT474 cells treated with multiple concentrations of trastuzumab were analyzed by the established
method of Chou and Talalay using CalcuSyn software (35).
The values of the combination index (CI) are shown in Table 1
and all of them are less than 1.0, indicating that the combination of trastuzumab and 2-DG/OX inhibits cell viability
synergistically in BT474 cells. To confirm these results, we
used 2 other ErbB2-positive breast cancer cell lines, ZR-7530
and SKBR3, and the combination also showed synergistic
inhibition in both cell lines (Fig. 1B and C and Table 1). These
results show that targeting glycolysis is a highly efficient
strategy to sensitize ErbB2-positive cancer cells to trastuzumab in vitro.
Trastuzumab inhibits glycolysis in human breast
cancer cells
Because trastuzumab has been shown to inhibit metabolism-regulating signaling molecules such as PI3K and mTOR,
it is logical to hypothesize that trastuzumab also may inhibit
glycolysis. To test this, we treated BT474 and ZR-7530 cells
with trastuzumab for 48 hours and measured glucose uptake
and lactate production, which are hallmarks of glycolysis.
Trastuzumab inhibited glucose uptake (Fig. 2A) and lactate
production (Fig. 2B) in a dose-dependent manner in both
BT474 and ZR-7530 cells, indicating that trastuzumab effectively inhibits glycolysis in breast cancer cells. To test
whether inhibiting glycolysis is simply a consequence of
the cell proliferation–inhibiting effect of trastuzumab, we
examined which inhibition happened first. We treated
BT474 cells with trastuzumab and counted cell number
and measured lactate production in the medium at different
time points. After 48 hours of trastuzumab treatment, compared with the control group, lactate production decreased
by more than 40% (Fig. 2C, middle). However, at this time
point, no cell growth inhibition was observed. Cell growth

inhibition occurred after 72 hours of trastuzumab treatment
(Fig. 2C, left). These results showed that the inhibition of
glycolysis by trastuzumab precedes cell growth inhibition,
indicating that glycolysis inhibition is not simply a consequence of the cell growth inhibition.
To study the relationship between the inhibitory effects on
glycolysis and cell viability by trastuzumab, we collected data
from 3 independent experiments and analyzed the correlation.
As shown in the correlation scatter graph, the inhibition of
glycolysis (lactate production) correlates well with the inhibition of cell viability by trastuzumab (R ¼ 0.8019; Fig. 2C, right).
Our previous studies showed that the ErbB2-HSF1-LDH-A
pathway has a major role in regulating glucose metabolism in
breast cancer cells (33). To test whether trastuzumab inhibits
glycolysis through this pathway, we treated BT474 and ZR-7530
cells with increasing concentrations of trastuzumab for 48
hours and found that trastuzumab decreased protein expression of HSF1 and LDH in both cell lines (Fig. 2D). We also
treated SKBR3 cells with increasing concentrations of trastuzumab for 48 hours and found similar results (Supplementary
Fig. S1), suggesting that trastuzumab inhibits glycolysis via
downregulation of HSF1 and LDH-A in breast cancer cells.
HSF1 contributes to the resistance of breast cancer cells
to trastuzumab
Previously, we reported that HSF1 transcriptionally activates LDH-A and promotes glycolysis in ErbB2-positive breast
cancer cells and in HSF1 knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts (33). Here, we further confirmed these results in ErbB2positive BT474 and SKBR3 cells. When HSF1 was downregulated by siRNA, the protein levels of LDH-A also decreased in
both BT474 and SKBR3 cells (Fig. 3A). Furthermore, HSF1
siRNA significantly reduced glucose uptake (Fig. 3B, left) and
lactate production (Fig. 3B, right). Together with the results
that trastuzumab inhibits glycolysis and HSF1 expression in
breast cancer cells (Fig. 2), these results further indicate that
downregulation of HSF1 contributes to glycolysis inhibition by
trastuzumab. Next, we examined whether HSF1 plays a role in
the resistance of breast cancer cells to trastuzumab. BT474
and SKBR3 cells were treated with 2 different HSF1 siRNAs to
downregulate HSF1 and then treated with trastuzumab.
Downregulation of HSF1 significantly increased the sensitivity
of both BT474 (Fig. 3C, top) and SKBR3 cells (Fig. 3C, bottom)
to trastuzumab. Moreover, the resistance of cancer cells to
trastuzumab is dependent on the protein levels of HSF1
(data not shown). We also used LDH-A siRNA to downregulate

LDH-A in BT474 cells and treated with trastuzumab. Downregulation of LDH-A robustically increased the sensitivity of
BT474 cells to trastuzumab (Supplementary Fig. S2). To
further confirm these results, we constructed stable HSF1overexpressing BT474 cells and found that overexpression of
HSF1 upregulated LDH-A protein levels (Fig. 3D, top) and
increased the resistance of cancer cells to trastuzumab
(Fig. 3D, bottom). These results indicate that downregulation
of HSF1 contributes to the glycolysis inhibition by trastuzumab and that the HSF1/LDH-A axis plays an important role in
the resistance of cancer cells to trastuzumab.
The combination of trastuzumab and glycolysis
inhibitors better inhibits glycolysis in cancer cells
Because trastuzumab inhibits glycolysis via downregulation
of HSF1 and LDH-A in breast cancer cells (Figs. 2 and 3), we
reasoned that the combination of trastuzumab and 2-DG or
OX may inhibit glycolysis more effectively than either agent
alone. When we treated BT474 and SKBR3 cells with trastuzumab or 2-DG alone, or trastuzumab plus 2-DG, the combination of trastuzumab and 2-DG showed a much stronger
inhibitory effect on both glucose uptake (Fig. 4A) and lactate
production (Fig. 4B) compared with either trastuzumab or
2-DG alone. Similarly, trastuzumab plus oxamate inhibited
lactate production much more effectively than either agent
alone in both BT474 and SKBR3 cells (Fig. 4C). These results
indicate that the combination of trastuzumab and glycolysis
inhibition better blocks glycolysis in ErbB2-positive breast
cancer cells.
The combination of trastuzumab and glycolytic
inhibitors effectively inhibits the growth of
trastuzumab-resistant cells in vitro
The treatment of ErbB2-positive human breast cancer
BT474 and SKBR3 cells with gradually increasing concentrations of trastuzumab led to an acquired resistance to trastuzumab (36). To examine whether trastuzumab-resistant cells
have altered glycolysis, we compared the parental BT474 cells
with their trastuzumab-resistant counterparts for glucose
uptake and lactate production. Indeed, compared with the
parental cells, trastuzumab-resistant BT474/TR cells have
increased glucose uptake and lactate production (Fig. 5A, left),
indicating that trastuzumab-resistant cells have increased
glycolysis. To confirm these results, we carried out similar
experiments in parental SKBR3 and trastuzumab-resistant
SKBR3/TRp2 cells and observed similar results (Fig. 5A, right).
We also compared HSF1 and LDH-A expression levels in these
cells and found that trastuzumab-resistant SKBR3/TRp2 and
BT474/TR cells have significantly higher HSF1 and LDH-A
levels (Supplementary Fig. S3), suggesting that trastuzumabresistant cells have increased glycolysis resulting from upregulation of HSF1 and LDH-A. Because trastuzumab-resistant
cells have increased glycolysis, we explored whether a glycolysis inhibitor could sensitize trastuzumab-resistant cells to
trastuzumab. We found that the combination of trastuzumab
and 2-DG/OX synergistically inhibits the growth of BT474/TR
cells (Fig. 5B and Table 1). We also confirmed these results in
another trastuzumab-resistant cell line MDA-MB-361 (Fig. 5C

4592

Cancer Res; 71(13) July 1, 2011

and Table 1). These data indicate that increased glycolysis
contributes to trastuzumab resistance and the combination of
trastuzumab and 2-DG or OX effectively inhibits trastuzumabresistant cancer cells in vitro.
The combination of trastuzumab and oxamate
synergistically inhibits tumor growth in vivo
Our aforementioned results showed that the combination
of trastuzumab and a glycolysis inhibitor synergistically inhibited the growth of both trastuzumab-sensitive and -resistant
cells in vitro (Figs. 1 and 5). To confirm these results in vivo, we
tested the combination treatment of trastuzumab and oxamate in a xenograft nude mice model. BT474 (Fig. 6A, left) and
its trastuzumab-resistant variant BT474/TR cells (Fig. 6A,
right) were inoculated into the mammary fat pads of 6week-old nude mice. After tumors formed, we treated tumor
xenografts with trastuzumab (10 mg/kg, i.p., 2 times/wk  3
weeks), oxamate (750 mg/kg, i.p., daily for 21 days), or a
combination of the agents. As we expected, compared with
the control group, trastuzumab inhibits BT474-derived tumor
growth (Fig. 6A, left). However, BT474/TR-derived tumors
were resistant to trastuzumab treatment (Fig. 6A, right).
The oxamate treatment inhibits both BT474- and BT474/
TR-derived tumor growth. Remarkably, the combination of
trastuzumab and oxamate was much more efficient in inhibiting the growth of both BT474 and BT474/TR tumors than
either of the single agents and retained the inhibitory effect
well beyond the time of cessation of treatment at day 22
(Fig. 6A).
To test whether the combination of trastuzumab and
oxamate efficiently inhibits LDH activity in the xenograft
tumors, we evaluated activity of LDH in the control, trastuzumab, oxamate, or trastuzumab plus oxamate treated
BT474 (Fig. 6B, left) or BT474/TR (Fig. 6B, right) tumors. We
found that the combination treatment was more efficient in
the inhibition of LDH activity compared with either of the
single agents in both types of tumors, suggesting that
glycolysis inhibition contributes to tumor growth inhibition
in vivo.
To test whether increased LDH activity contributes to
trastuzumab resistance in vivo, we compared LDH activity
between BT474 and BT474/TR tumors. Compared with BT474
tumors, BT474/TR tumors have significantly greater LDH
activity (Fig. 6C), which is consistent with the data obtained
in vitro (Fig. 5A). These results further support that increased
glycolysis contributes to trastuzumab resistance.

Discussion
Thus far, the mechanisms by which trastuzumab inhibits
ErbB2-positive breast cancer development are still not fully
defined. Previous studies showed that trastuzumab inhibits
PI3K/Akt signaling (5), which is not only a regulator of cell
survival but also a regulator of cellular metabolism. However, it is unknown whether altered glycolysis may serve as a
mechanism in trastuzumab-mediated cancer inhibition. In
this study, we use multiple ErbB2-positive cell lines (BT474,
SKBR3, MDA-MB-361, and ZR-7530) to address the role of

trastuzumab in glycolysis inhibition in breast cancer cells.
We found that trastuzumab decreased glucose and lactate
production in these cells, indicating that trastuzumab
indeed inhibits glycolysis in these cells. The inhibition of
glycolysis by trastuzumab precedes cell growth inhibition,
indicating that glycolysis inhibition is not simply a consequence of cell growth inhibition by trastuzumab. Because
dysregulated glycolysis contributes to the malignant behavior of cancer cell, these results suggest that inhibition of
glycolysis may serve as a mechanism for the tumor inhibitory effect of trastuzumab.
It has been reported that bioenergetic alteration plays a role
in chemoresistance (13), and we have reported that targeting
glycolysis can sensitize cancer cells to chemotherapy (14).
However, it is unknown whether the switch of energetic
dependency contributes to trastuzumab resistance. To examine whether trastuzumab-resistant cells have altered glycolysis, we compared glucose uptake and lactate production
between parental BT474 or SKBR3 cells and their trastuzumab-resistant counterparts (BT474/TR or SKBR3/TRp2 cells).
Compared with parental cells, trastuzumab-resistant cells
show increased glycolysis, as indicated by higher glucose
uptake and lactate production. In vivo studies also showed
that BT474/TR-derived tumors have a higher LDH activity
than BT474-derived tumors. These data suggested that
increased glycolysis contributes to trastuzumab resistance.
This may serve as a novel mechanism of trastuzumab resistance.
Our previous study showed that the ErbB2-HSF1-LDH-A
pathway plays a major role in regulating glycolysis in breast
cancer cells (33). Here, for the first time, we show that HSF1 is
upregulated in trastuzumab-resistant cells and that the downregulation of HSF1 or LDH-A increases the sensitivity of breast
cancer cells to trastuzumab. Moreover, overexpression of
HSF1 decreased the sensitivity to trastuzumab. These novel
findings indicated that HSF1/LDH-A enhanced glycolysis contributes to the resistance of breast cancer cells to trastuzumab.
The increased dependency of cancer cells upon the glycolytic pathway is well accepted as an important process
that supports malignant phenotypes (18). Inhibition of glycolysis as a strategy to preferentially kill cancer cells and the
development of glycolytic inhibitors as anticancer agents
has become a rapidly growing area in cancer research.
Several glycolytic inhibitors with promising anticancer activity are currently at various stages of preclinical and clinical
development (15, 24, 25). 2-DG has been shown to have
effects in selectively inhibiting solid tumors and is currently
under phase I and II clinical trials (27–29). Another promising glycolysis inhibitor, oxamate, a specific inhibitor of the
LDH, also has shown promising results and is currently
under preclinical investigation (30). However, 2-DG alone
did not show a significant effect upon tumor growth in vivo
(27). Recently, it has been reported that 2-DG may activate
prosurvival signaling pathways in cancer cells (31, 32),
suggesting that the combination of 2-DG with other signaling inhibitors in a 2-DG–based therapy may result in
enhanced therapeutic efficacy. Here, we show that the

4596

Cancer Res; 71(13) July 1, 2011

combination of 2-DG with a PI3K/Akt inhibiting agent,
such as trastuzumab, synergistically inhibited tumor
growth in vitro. These results are consistent with a recent
study showing that treating cancer cells with the combination of 2-DG and an IGFIR inhibitor dramatically reduced
cancer cell proliferation and promoted significant apoptosis
(31, 32).
For the first time, we report that the combination of
trastuzumab with glycolysis inhibitors, 2-DG or OX, synergistically inhibits breast cancer cell growth. More importantly, this combinational therapy effectively inhibits the
growth of trastuzumab-resistant cancer cells in vitro and
in vivo. Interestingly, glycolysis inhibition by trastuzumab
precedes cell growth inhibition and the combination treatment is more efficient at inhibiting glycolysis both in vitro
and in vivo compared with either of the single agents used
alone. These novel findings indicate that glycolysis inhibition contributes to the synergistic antitumor effect of combinational therapy, and targeting glycolysis could be an
effective strategy for overcoming trastuzumab resistance
in cancer therapy.
In summary, we report that trastuzumab inhibits glycolysis
via downregulation of HSF1 and LDH-A in ErbB2-positive
breast cancer cells, which may serve as a novel mechanism for
trastuzumab-induced tumor growth inhibition. We also show
that the combination of trastuzumab and glycolysis inhibition
synergistically inhibits growth of both trastuzumab-sensitive
and -resistant breast cancer cells in vitro and in vivo, which
correlates to a more efficient inhibition of glycolysis. Moreover, we are the first to report that the increased glycolysis
mediated by HSF1 and LDH-A contributes to trastuzumab
resistance. These findings revealed that the switch of energetic
dependency to glycolysis contributes to trastuzumab resistance, and glycolysis inhibition is a promising therapeutic
strategy to overcome trastuzumab resistance. This is important for the future design of combined therapeutics targeting
both ErbB2 and glycolysis to treat ErbB2-positive and trastuzumab-resistant breast cancers.
