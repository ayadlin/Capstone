ABSTRACT
We describe a customizable approach to cancer therapy in which a gold
nanoparticle (Au-NP) delivers a drug that is selectively activated within the cancer cell
by the presence of an mRNA unique to the cancer cell. Fundamental to this approach
is the observation that the amount of drug released from the Au-NP is proportional to
both the presence and abundance of the cancer cell specific mRNA in a cell. As proofof-principle, we demonstrate both the efficient delivery and selective release of the
multi-kinase inhibitor dasatinib from Au-NPs in leukemia cells with resulting efficacy
in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, these Au-NPs reduce toxicity against hematopoietic
stem cells and T-cells. This approach has the potential to improve the therapeutic
efficacy of a drug and minimize toxicity while being highly customizable with respect
to both the cancer cell specific mRNAs targeted and drugs activated.

the targeted cancer and additional chemical and synthetic
considerations including that the linkage site occurs at a
location within the drug that will not perturb drug binding
and efficacy. While nucleic acid functionalized Au-NPs are
internalized by many different cell types both in vitro and
in vivo [1], only in cancer cells will the unique, targeted
RNA bind to the anti-sense oligonucleotide and displace
the drug-conjugated DNA oligonucleotide not covalently
linked to the Au-NP. As a binary reaction, the magnitude
of drug-conjugated oligonucleotide release correlates with
the presence and abundance of the unique RNA. Thus,
active (non-sequestered) intracellular drug concentration is
enhanced in the cancer cells. Concurrent with drug release,
the RNA bound to the Au-NP undergoes degradation by
cellular nucleases targeting DNA/RNA hybrids and,
therefore, depletes the target cell of a gene required for
survival and proliferation [2, 3]. This approach provides a
novel targeting opportunity to increase the concentration
of free drug in cancer cells relative to normal cells and,

INTRODUCTION
Despite a rapidly expanding cancer therapy
armamentarium many cancers remain incurable and the
morbidity and mortality from current therapies remains
high. We describe a novel approach to cancer therapy that
merges diverse and multi-disciplinary technologies in the
areas of drug delivery, pro-drug activation, personalized
medicine, and the simultaneous targeting of orthogonal
pathways in cancer cells. This approach functionalizes
gold nanoparticles (Au-NPs) with short, double-stranded
DNA oligonucleotides with sequence corresponding to a
gene that is unique to or overexpressed in a cancer cell
(Figure 1). Importantly, only the anti-sense strand of the
DNA duplex is covalently attached to the gold nanoparticle
via a thiol linker at the 3’ terminus of the oligonucleotide.
In addition, a molecularly targeted, or cytotoxic, drug is
conjugated to the non-covalently linked DNA strand. Drug
selection is predicated on known or anticipated efficacy in

therefore, to potentially maximize efficacy and minimize
toxicity. This system is potentially tailorable to any cancer
for which a unique RNA and appropriate drug exist.
Supporting the feasibility of this approach, sequencespecific, fluorophore-conjugated oligonucleotides attached
to Au-NPs have been developed (NanoFlare [3, 4]) and
commercialized (SmartFlare; EMD Millipore) as a
technology for detecting and measuring RNA levels in
living cells. Furthermore, nucleic acid functionalized AuNPs exhibit additional favorable therapeutic properties
including high uptake into diverse cell types that can be
in excess of one million nanoparticles per cell, stability in
biological environments including resistance to nucleases,
minimal cell toxicity, and low immunogenicity [1, 5].
Finally, nucleic acid functionalized Au-NPs delivering
siRNA or DNA anti-sense payloads have shown in
vivo efficacy following intravenous injection against
xenotransplanted gastric and brain tumors [6, 7].

Conjugation of dasatinib to an oligonucleotide
For proof-of-principle, we selected the drug
dasatinib because it is a potent multi-kinase inhibitor [8]
(SRC, KIT, BCR/ABL, LYN) and it has been selectively
modified at its free hydroxyl position without perturbing its
binding affinity to the BCR/ABL kinase [9]. Accordingly,
the free hydroxyl on dasatinib was converted to an azide
group and then reacted using “click chemistry” [10] with
a commercially available oligonucleotide containing a
5’-alkyne functional group to generate a dasatinib-DNA
conjugate (Figure 2A and Supplementary Figure S1). As
predicted, we found that conjugating an oligonucleotide
to dasatinib did not significantly impair its half maximal
inhibitory concentration (IC50) for SRC and KIT kinases
in vitro (Figure 2B, 2C).

Figure 1: Development of an Au-NP based system for selective drug activation in cancer cells mediated by cancer cell
specific mRNA. Each gold particle is conjugated to ~150-200 oligonucleotides (red) via a thiol linker. The sequence of the oligonucleotide

is complementary (anti-sense) to a mRNA that is either overexpressed in or unique to cancer cells. A shorter, complementary drugconjugated oligonucleotide (drug-orange; oligonucleotide-green) is annealed to the anti-sense oligonucleotide to generate a drug-DNA
Au-NP. After cellular uptake, the targeted mRNA (blue) binds to the complementary DNA sequences linked to the Au-NP. This binding
displaces the drug-conjugated oligonucleotide from sequestration to the Au-NP and allows it to inhibit its targeted enzymes. The amount
of drug-conjugated oligonucleotide released is proportional to the amount of cancer cell specific mRNA present in the cell. Additionally,
mRNAs sequestered by the nanoparticle undergo nuclease degradation.

Specificity of Au-NPs for targeted cancer cell
specific mRNA

Highly efficient uptake of Au-NPs by
leukemia cells

The oligonucleotide sequence conjugated to
dasatinib was initially designed to target the human
BIRC5 (survivin) mRNA. BIRC5 mRNA is highly
expressed in many cancers relative to differentiated
tissues and thus represents an attractive target for this
technology [11]. Furthermore, NanoFlare particles
designed to target BIRC5 mRNA have been previously
developed and validated [3]. We also designed
oligonucleotides to target the breakpoint regions of
the t(8;21) (AML1/ETO) translocation that occurs with
high frequency in acute myeloid leukemia [12]. The
breakpoint, or the position in the hybrid mRNA where
the sequence shifts from one gene to the other, is unique
to only cancer cells and, thus, is also an ideal mRNA
target for this approach.
For initial characterization purposes, the noncovalently linked DNA strand contained a terminal
Cy5 fluorophore rather than dasatinib (Cy5-DNA).
When annealed to its complementary oligonucleotide
conjugated to the Au-NP, the fluorophore is quenched
by the gold but fluoresces when displaced from the AuNP by the binding of the target mRNA. Addition of a
complementary, but not scrambled, oligonucleotide
that mimics the targeted mRNA sequence to the Cy5DNA Au-NPs increased fluorescence signal in vitro
and confirmed the specificity of each nanoparticle
for its targeted gene (Supplementary Figure S2). We
also engineered murine NIH3T3 cells and human
HEK293T cells to express human BIRC5 or AML1/
ETO mRNA in the presence of doxycycline. Further
supporting the specificity of these nanoparticles, after
overnight incubation with Cy5-DNA Au-NPs there
was increased release of the fluorophore-conjugated
DNA oligonucleotide in the presence relative to the
absence of doxycycline (Figure 3A, 3B). Together, these
experiments demonstrate the selective release of the
oligonucleotide from sequestration to the Au-NP in the
presence of the cancer cell specific targeted mRNA.
We next synthesized Au-NPs functionalized with
BIRC5 mRNA targeting oligonucleotides in which the
non-covalently attached oligonucleotide was conjugated
to dasatinib (dasatinib-DNA Au-NP). We tested the
specificity of these dasatinib-DNA Au-NPs using the in
vitro SRC kinase assay (Figure 3C). In the presence of
dasatinib-DNA Au-NPs, SRC kinase retains full activity
suggesting that the dasatinib-conjugated oligonucleotide
is unable to inhibit SRC kinase activity when sequestered
to the Au-NP. However, upon the addition of an
oligonucleotide mimicking the BIRC5 mRNA sequence,
but not a scrambled control oligonucleotide, SRC kinase
activity is significantly attenuated consistent with the
sequence specific release of the dasatinib-conjugated
oligonucleotide from the Au-NP.

We utilized human leukemia cells to test the
dasatinib-DNA Au-NPs in a more complex cellular
environment as high BIRC5 mRNA expression and
dasatinib-sensitive mutations or kinase dependence
frequently occur in both chronic and acute leukemia.
Efficient uptake (>99%) of fluorescently labeled, nucleic
acid conjugated Au-NPs occurred after overnight
incubation for all leukemia cell lines tested (Figure 4A).
Furthermore, near complete uptake continued to occur
in leukemia cells despite being mixed with a 100-1000fold excess of normal human or mouse bone marrow cells
(Figure 4B, 4C), suggesting highly efficient uptake of
Au-NPs by leukemia cells. Finally, a single injection of
fluorescently labeled Au-NPs into subcutaneous leukemia
xenografts also resulted in significant uptake of Au-NPs
into leukemia cells (Figure 4D, 4E).

Dasatinib conjugated Au-NPs inhibit kinase
targets in leukemia cells
Following confirmation of efficient uptake of
Au-NPs into leukemia cells, we tested dasatinibDNA Au-NPs with K562 leukemia cells that express
BIRC5 mRNA, harbor a dasatinib-sensitive BCR/
ABL translocation, and exhibit high SRC kinase
activity. After overnight incubation with dasatinibDNA Au-NPs, K562 cells were assessed for phosphoSRC and phospho-CRKL levels by flow cytometry.
Phosphorylated CRKL, a BCR/ABL adaptor protein,
serves as a surrogate of BCR/ABL activity [13]. As
shown in Figure 5A, both phospho-CRKL and phosphoSRC levels were significantly diminished in the presence
of dasatinib-DNA Au-NPs targeting BIRC5 mRNA,
but not a scrambled control sequence, confirming that
dasatinib effectively inhibits its expected targets in a
cellular environment. We also tested dasatinib-DNA AuNPs with the Kasumi-1 leukemia cell line that harbors
an activating KIT mutation and expresses BIRC5 mRNA
[14, 15]. It has been previously shown in Kasumi-1 cells
that dasatinib prevents the phosphorylation of AKT
via inhibition of mutant KIT and SRC kinases [16]. In
agreement, dasatinib-DNA Au-NPs decreased phosphoAKT levels with comparable efficacy to dasatinib
(Supplementary Figure S3). Furthermore, supporting
the bi-functional targeting of these Au-NPs, we also
found significantly decreased BIRC5 mRNA levels after
BIRC5 targeting Au-NP treatment. Although efficient
knockdown required a higher concentration of Au-NPs
(5 nM) and a longer incubation period than that required
for efficient SRC kinase or phospho-CRKL inhibition
(Supplementary Figure S4). As previously shown,
BIRC5 mRNA knockdown was enhanced by partial
substitution of the DNA backbone with locked nucleic

acids and likely occurs via a mechanism analogous to
anti-sense technologies [17].

the diminished toxic effect of dasatinib-DNA Au-NPs
on T-cells and CD34 cells. To control for the different
Au-NP uptake exhibited by different cells types,
we again utilized murine NIH3T3 cells engineered
to express human BIRC5 mRNA in the presence of
doxycycline. In this system, dasatinib-DNA Au-NPs
decreased phospho-SRC levels in the presence, but not
the absence, of doxycycline induced BIRC5 mRNA
expression (Figure 6C). These data also suggest that this
approach may be extendable to more toxic drugs than
dasatinib.

Dasatinib conjugated Au-NPs diminish the
viability of leukemia cells
We next examined the effect of the dasatinib-DNA
Au-NPs on leukemia cell proliferation and viability. As
shown in Figure 5B, dasatinib-DNA Au-NPs targeting
the human BIRC5 mRNA, but not a scrambled control,
significantly inhibit the proliferation of dasatinibsensitive leukemia cell lines. In contrast, there was
minimal effect on 32D cells, a murine hematopoietic
cell line lacking human BIRC5 mRNA. Consistent with
this result, sub-nanomolar concentrations of dasatinibDNA Au-NPs increased apoptosis in K562 leukemia
cells as evidenced by annexin-V staining (Figure
5C). Citrate-capped Au-NPs, lacking any nucleic
acid functionalization, had no effect on leukemia cell
proliferation or apoptosis (Supplementary Figure S5A
& B). As illustrated in Figure 5D, dasatinib-DNA AuNP treatment also strongly reduced the ability of K562
cells to form colonies in methylcellulose, indicating
that the dasatinib-DNA Au-NPs inhibit the proliferative
potential of leukemia colony-forming cells. Control
Au-NPs, either lacking dasatinib or with a scrambled
targeting sequence, had no significant effect on K562
colony formation. Finally, treatment of K562 cells with
dasatinib-DNA Au-NPs for 4 hours prior to intravenous
injection into NSG mice significantly delayed leukemia
development (Figure 5E).

DISCUSSION
We have developed a novel therapeutic approach
to dramatically increase the concentration of free drug
in cancer cells relative to normal cells and, therefore,
maximize efficacy and minimize toxicity. While we
demonstrated feasibility and efficacy using dasatinib,
one of the strengths of this approach is that we envision
it to be highly customizable with respect to both the
genes targeted and drugs activated. This technology can
be tailored to a particular type of cancer by identifying
a unique cancer cell specific RNA and appropriate drug.
Examples of molecularly targeted drugs that have been
successfully conjugated to other biomolecules without
diminishing drug efficacy and could, in principle, be
utilized in this approach include nilotinib, midostaurin,
sunitinib, SN-38, tozasertib, gefitinib, bosutinib,
orantinib, olaparib, and purvalanol B [25]. Furthermore,
gold nanoparticles can be concomitantly functionalized
with multiple drug-conjugated oligonucleotides or
biological groups (proteins, siRNA, molecular beacons)
and thus could deliver multiple payloads targeting
orthogonal cancer pathways. Further functionalizing
the drug-conjugated nanoparticles with cancer cell
specific antibodies [26] or aptamers [27] may allow
for more targeted cancer cell uptake. Additional
selective targeting and optimized Au-NP delivery
may also be obtained by capitalizing on the enhanced
permeability and retention (EPR) effect in solid tumors.
The EPR effect is the property by which nanoparticles
accumulate in tumors more than in normal tissues
secondary to perturbations in tumor vasculature [28].
In support of this, intravenously administered nucleic
acid functionalized gold nanoparticles (siRNA and
molecular beacons) accumulated in xenografted murine
solid tumors and caused tumor regression with otherwise
minimal toxicity [6, 7]. In summary, we anticipate that
with further optimization this approach may represent
a novel and customizable therapy for cancer with the
potential to improve the therapeutic efficacy of a drug
and minimize toxicity.

Dasatinib conjugated Au-NPs reduce toxicity
against CD34 cells and T-cells
Dasatinib inhibits the normal functions of a variety
of hematopoietic lineages including CD34 stem cells
[18], T lymphocytes [19, 20], NK cells [21], platelets
[22], neutrophils [23], and osteoclasts [24]. Based on
the selective release of the dasatinib in cancer cells,
we predicted that dasatinib-DNA Au-NPs should also
exhibit less toxicity than dasatinib against cells with
less of the targeted mRNA. In support of this, dasatinib,
but not dasatinib-DNA Au-NPs, significantly diminished
phospho-SRC levels in human CD34 cells (Figure 6A).
Similarly, dasatinib, but not dasatinib-DNA Au-NPs,
inhibited T-cell activation by CD3/CD28-beads (Figure
6B). Of note, we observed less avid uptake of Au-NPs
in CD34 cells and a subset of T-cells (CD8+) relative to
other cell lines tested (Supplementary Figure S6). This
diminished Au-NP uptake as well as the sequestration of
the dasatinib-conjugated oligonucleotide to the Au-NP
in the absence of target mRNA likely both contribute to

by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 25 minutes x 3 and
suspension in PBS.

Oligonucleotides & reagents

Dasatinib-oligonucleotide conjugation

Unmodified, 3’-thiol modified, 5’-hexynyl (alkyne)
modified, and fluorophore-conjugated oligonucleotides
(Supplementary Table 1) were obtained from IDT and
purified as recommended. Oligonucleotides containing
locked nucleic acids were obtained from Exiqon. 3’-thiol
modified oligonucleotides were deprotected with 100 mM
DTT for 1.5 hours at room temperature and then purified
using a NAP-5 column (GE Healthcare). Dasatinib was
from LC Laboratories. Citrate stabilized, 15 nm Au
colloids were obtained from Ted Pella. Cytokines were
from PeproTech.

The 5′-alkynyl modified deoxyoligonucleotides
(3; Supplementary Figure 1) were ordered from IDT
or prepared with an Expedite nucleic acid synthesizer
using a 5’-hexynyl phosphoramidite. The dasatinib
azido derivative 2 (Supplementary Figure 1) was
prepared from commercially available dasatinib (1;
Supplementary Figure 1) according to a literature
procedure with slight modifications [30]. To the mixture
of dasatinib (488 mg, 1.0 mmol) in dry DMF/THF
(15 mL, 2:1, v/v) at 0 °C, triethylamine (0.28 mL, 2.0
mmol) was added and the mixture was stirred for 10
minutes. Methanesulfonyl chloride (155 μL, 2.0 mmol)
was added slowly and the solution was allowed to warm
up to room temperature overnight. Sodium azide (152
mg, 2.33 mmol) was added and the mixture was heated
to 50 °C and stirred for 47 hrs. After cooling to room
temperature, about 5 mL reaction mixture (~1/3 portion,
0.33 mmol) was taken out, quenched with water, and
extracted with dichloromethane. The organic layers were
combined. The solvent was removed, the residue was
isolated by silica gel chromatography, eluting with 5%
methanol in dichloromethane to yield 2 (Supplementary
Figure 1) as a white solid 139 mg (82% yield). MS (ESAPI) calculated for C22H26ClN10OS [MH+] 513.2, found
513.2.
To a solution of 5′-alkynyl oligonucleotide 3 (71
nmol) in water (200 μL), were added 2 (Supplementary
Figure 1) in DMSO (355 μL, 10 mM, 3.55 μmol), THPTA
(tris(3-hydroxypropyltriazolylmethyl)amine)/CuSO4
(1:1) complex in water (27 μL, 66 mM, 1.78 μmol),
and aqueous sodium ascorbate (28.4 μL, 100 mM, 2.84
μmol). The mixture was degassed with argon. After the
mixture was kept at room temperature for 1 hour and
chloroform extracted, the aqueous phase was loaded onto
a 20% dPAGE gel and purified. Dasatinib-DNA conjugate
(I; Supplementary Figure 1) was obtained in 33% yield
(23.6 nmol) and MALDI-Tof MS calculated for MH+,
5008.0, found 5007.1. Dasatinib-DNA conjugate (II;
Supplementary Figure 1) was obtained in 32% yield (64
nmol) and MALDI-Tof MS calculated for MH+, 5287.3,
found 5286.4.

Oligonucleotide functionalized gold nanoparticle
synthesis
Oligonucleotide modified gold nanoparticles were
prepared according to literature procedures [4, 29]. In
brief, deprotected alkylthiol-terminated oligonucleotides
(IDT; 5 μM) were combined with citrate-capped 15nm gold particles (Ted Pella; 15 nM diameter), 10 nM
Na-Phosphate pH 8.0, and 0.01% SDS and incubated
for 20-60 minutes at room temperature with gentle
rocking. Sodium chloride was then added every 20
minutes in 50 mM increments to achieve a final NaCl
concentration of 500 mM. The SDS and Na-Phosphate
buffer concentrations were maintained at 0.01% and 10
mM, respectively. The particles were then sonicated for
10 seconds and shaken at room temperature overnight. The
DNA conjugated Au-NPs were purified from unattached
oligonucleotides by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 25
minutes x 3 and re-suspended in phosphate buffered saline
(PBS). Next, the complementary oligonucleotide (either
dasatinib or fluorophore conjugated), at ~100-fold excess,
was hybridized to the purified DNA-conjugated Au-NPs
by heating the mixture to 80 °C and then slowly cooling to
4 °C over several hours in a PCR machine. The resulting
Au-NPs were purified by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for
25 minutes x 3 at 4 °C, suspended in PBS, and stored at
4 °C. Au-NP concentration was determined by measuring
absorbance at 520 nm [29].
Au-NPs in which the fluorophore is covalently
attached to the Au-NP (i.e. for the experiments shown in
Figure 4A) were either purchased (Cy5 or Cy3 Uptake
Control SmartFlare, EMD Millipore) or were synthesized
by two different approaches. First, Au-NPs were
functionalized as described above with an oligonucleotide
containing both a 3’-thiol linker and a 5’-Cy5
modification. Alternatively, Au-NPs already functionalized
with oligonucleotides, but lacking a fluorophore, were
backfilled with Cy5-PEG-thiol (Nanocs). In this approach
DNA Au-NPs were incubated with Cy5-PEG-thiol 30
μM for 4 hours at room temperature prior to purification

Cy5-DNA conjugated gold NPs were incubated
in PBS at a concentration of 1 nM. An excess of fully
complementary, or scrambled control, oligonucleotide
was added to the solution. The mixture was allowed to
incubate at room temperature for 30 minutes, after which
the resulting fluorescence was measured from 640-740 nm

inducible cell lines

RT-PCR

AML1/ETO was PCR amplified using Q5 HighFidelity Polymerase (New England Biolabs) from a
pMSCV-AML1/ETO plasmid (gift from Dr. J. Mulloy).
The PCR product was transferred into the EcoRI
and AgeI sites of the tetracycline-inducible pLVXTet-One vector (Clontech) using In-Fusion cloning
(Clontech). A portion of the resulting pLVX-Tet-One
vector was then PCR amplified (Forward Primer: 5’CAGCAGAGATCCAGTTTATCGACTT-3’; Reverse
Primer: 5’- TGCAGAATTAATTCCAGGCGGG -3’)
and transferred into a plasmid with AAVS1 homology
arms (derived from AAVS1-SA-2A-puro-pA donor,
Addgene plasmid #22075) using In-fusion cloning. The
inducible, transgene plasmids were then co-transfected
into HEK293T cells using Lipofectamine 3000 (Thermo
Fisher) along with the gRNA_AAVS1-T2 (Addgene
plasmid #41818) and pCas9_GFP (Addgene Plasmid
#44719) plasmids. Three days after transfection the
resistant cells were selected with puromycin (2 μg/mL).
For the BIRC5 gene, the human coding sequence was
obtained as GeneArt Gene Synthesis (Invitrogen) and
cloned into the EcoRI and BamHI site of the pLVXTet-One vector (Clontech) using the In-Fusion HD
cloning system (Clontech). This vector was then used to
generate lentiviral particles that were used to transduce
NIH3T3 cells. After cells were selected with puromycin,

expression was confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR.

Leukemia cells were treated with DNA-Au
NPs (5 nM) for 96 hours. The locked nucleic acid
(LNA) Au-NPs contained 4 LNAs at both the 5’ and
3’ termini (CCCAGCCTTCCAGCTCCTTGT10; bold
denotes LNAs). Total RNA was isolated using the
RNeasy Plus mini kit (Quiagen). Reverse transcription
was performed with 1 μg total RNA and qScript
cDNA Supermix (Quanta Biosciences). Quantitative
real time PCR was performed using PerfeCTa®
SYBR® Green SuperMix (Quanta Biosciences) on
an ABI 7500 PCR system. The primers used were
5′- AGGACCACCGCATCTCTACAT-3′ (sense) and
5′-GTTCTGAGTGTGACCGAGAAGGTA-3′ (antisense)
for BIRC5 and 5′- AAGTCTGGCTCGTTCTCAGTG -3′
(sense) and 5′-CAGGAAAGACACCCACCTTGATCT-3′
(antisense) for β-actin. All reactions were run in
triplicate, and the relative expression of BIRC5 was
calculated by normalizing BIRC5 mRNA expression to
β-actin mRNA expression.

In vitro kinase assays
Src and c-KIT in vitro ADP-Glo Kinase Assays
(Promega) were used according to manufacturer’s
instructions. Luminescence was measured in the
presence of increasing concentrations of either dasatinib
or dasatinib-conjugated oligonucleotide and 100 ng
of recombinant enzyme (Promega). IC50 values were
calculated using GraphPad Prism 6.0 and nonlinear
regression log(inhibitor) vs. response model. Alternatively,
luminescence was measured in the presence of dasatinibDNA Au-NPs and an excess of either a scrambled
oligonucleotide or an oligonucleotide mimicking the
sequence of the BIRC5 mRNA.

Microscopy
Cells were grown on glass bottom, tissue culture
plates (MatTek) in the presence or absence of doxycycline
1 μg/mL. After 48 hours of culture in doxycycline, Cy5DNA Au-NPs (0.5 nM) were added to the cells. After
overnight incubation, the cells were stained with Hoechst
33342 (1 μg/mL) for 15 minutes, washed, and assessed by
microscopy with an EVOS FL Auto Imaging System (Life
Technologies).

Cell lines and culture
Leukemia cell lines were obtained from ATCC
and DSMZ. Leukemia cell lines were grown in RPMI
supplemented with FCS 10% and penicillin-streptomycin.
The media for SKNO-1 also included GM-CSF 10 ng/
mL. The media for 32D cells included murine IL-3 1
ng/mL. HEK293T and 3T3 cells were grown in DMEM
supplemented with FCS 10% and penicillin-streptomycin.
GFP expressing K562 leukemia cells were generated by
transducing K562 cells with MSCV PIG (Puro-IRES-GFP;
Addgene plasmid #18751) retrovirus and selecting with
puromycin.

Flow cytometry assays
Antibodies
against
phospho-SRC
(clone
SC1T2M3), phospho-Akt (clone SDRNR), CD69 (clone
FN50), CD4 (clone SK3), CD8 (clone SK3), and isotype
controls were from eBiosciences. Phospho-CrkL (clone
K30-391.50.80) was from BD Biosciences. Cells were
treated as described and then fixed, permeabilized,
and stained with antibodies for 30-60 minutes in the
dark. The cells were analyzed by flow cytometry after
washing on a BD FACSAria II.

Proliferation, apotosis, and colony assays

were treated overnight with 0.5 nM Au-NPs covalently
labeled with Cy5. The following day, the percent cells
Cy5 positive was determined by flow cytometry. Prior
to flow cytometry, the T-cells were also stained for CD4
and CD8.

In 96-well plate format, leukemia cells were treated
as described for 48 hours and then viability assessed
with the CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay
(Promega). All experiments were performed in triplicate
with at least 3 wells per condition. To assess apoptosis,
leukemia cells were treated with dasatinib or dasatinibDNA Au-NPs for 72 hours, stained with annexin-V, and
analyzed by flow cytometry. For colony-formation assays,
103 K562 cells were plated in methylcellulose (Stem Cell
Technologies) following 4 hours of pre-treatment with AuNPs (1 nM). Colonies were counted 7 days after plating.

Xenograft studies
NSG
(NOD.Cg-Prkdcscid,
Il2rgtm1Wjl/SzJ;
Jackson Labs) mice were housed under aseptic conditions
and received autoclaved cages, bedding material, water,
bottles, and irradiated food. Mouse care was in accordance
with protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care
and Use Committee at the University of Minnesota. K562
leukemia cells were treated for 4 hours with dasatinibDNA Au-NPs 1 nM or control DNA Au-NPs lacking
dasatinib, prior to being injected intravenously via the tail
vein into 5-7 week old NSG mice. Mice were observed
until death or they met euthanasia criteria secondary to
leukemia.

Competition assays
Either murine bone marrow cells (red cell lysed)
or human bone marrow mononuclear cells (Lonza) were
mixed at specified ratios with leukemia cells stained
with Cell-Trace Violet (Invitrogen). Cy5-DNA Au-NPs
(Cy5 covalently attached to Au-NP as described above;
0.5 nM) were then added to the cells and allowed to
incubate overnight. The cells were then analyzed by
flow cytometry. Within the violet gate (leukemia cells),
the percent of cells positive for Cy5 was measured. For
in vivo experiments, GFP expressing K562 leukemia
cells were injected subcutaneously into both flanks of
NSG mice. When tumors became palpable (~10-14 days
post-injection), Cy5-DNA Au-NPs were injected directly
into a tumor on one flank. The next day, the mouse was
euthanized, both tumors excised, dissociated by passing
through a 40 micron cell strainer, and analyzed by flow
cytometry as described above.

Statistical analysis
Results are shown as the mean plus or minus the
SEM of the results of at least 3 experiments. The Student’s
t-test or ANOVA were used for statistical comparisons
between groups and were calculated using GraphPad
Prism 6 software (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA). For
the mouse survival curve a log-rank test was calculated.
P-values less than 0.05 were considered statistically
significant.

Freshly defrosted human CD34 cells (Lonza) were
grown in cytokine containing media (Stem Cell Factor
100 ng/mL, Thrombopoietin 100 ng/mL, and FLT3
ligand 100 ng/mL) for 24 hours prior to the addition of
dasatinib 5 nM or dasatinib-DNA Au-NPs 5 nM. After
an additional 24 hour incubation, the CD34 cells were
fixed and permeabilized as described above, stained for
phospho-Src, and analyzed by flow cytometry. Human
CD3 T-cells (Astarte Biologics) were grown in 96 wells
plates (80,000 cells/well). T-cells were then treated for
6 hours with 5 nM dasatinib, dasatinib-DNA Au-NPs,
or control Au-NPs prior to being stimulated by the
addition of 2 μL of CD3/CD28 Dynabeads, according
to manufacturer’s instructions (Invitrogen). After 24
hours, the T-cell/bead mix was vortexed and thoroughly
pipetted prior to removing the beads by placing the
mixture in a magnet for 2 minutes and then removing
the supernatant containing cells. The T-cells were then
stained for CD69 and analyzed by flow cytometry. To
assess Au-NP uptake, 100,000 CD34 cells and T-cells
