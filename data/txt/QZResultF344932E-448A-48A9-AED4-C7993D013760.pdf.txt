ABSTRACT
The Mouse Double Minute 2 (MDM2) oncogene plays a critical role in cancer
development and progression through p53-dependent and p53-independent
mechanisms. Both natural and synthetic MDM2 inhibitors have been shown anticancer
activity against several human cancers. We have recently identified a novel ginsenoside,
25-OCH3-PPD (GS25), one of the most active anticancer ginsenosides discovered thus
far, and have demonstrated its MDM2 inhibition and anticancer activity in various
human cancer models, including prostate cancer. However, the oral bioavailability
of GS25 is limited, which hampers its further development as an oral anticancer
agent. The present study was designed to develop a novel nanoparticle formulation
for oral delivery of GS25. After GS25 was successfully encapsulated into PEG-PLGA
nanoparticles (GS25NP) and its physicochemical properties were characterized, the
efficiency of MDM2 targeting, anticancer efficacy, pharmacokinetics, and safety were
evaluated in in vitro and in vivo models of human prostate cancer. Our results indicated
that, compared with the unencapsulated GS25, GS25NP demonstrated better MDM2
inhibition, improved oral bioavailability and enhanced in vitro and in vivo activities.
In conclusion, the validated nano-formulation for GS25 oral delivery improves its
molecular targeting, oral bioavailability and anticancer efficacy, providing a basis
for further development of GS25 as a novel agent for cancer therapy and prevention.

has been used for the treatment and prevention of many
diseases, including cancer [3–4]. The anticancer properties
of ginseng have largely been attributed to its saponin
constituents, which are termed ginsenosides [4]. We have
recently identified a novel ginsenoside, 25-OCH3-PPD
(GS25), from Panax notoginseng, which is thought to be
the most potent anticancer ginsenoside discovered thus
far [5–6]. GS25 has been shown to be active against
several human cancers such as lung [7], pancreatic [8],
breast [9], and prostate cancers [10–11]. In various cancer

INTRODUCTION
The majority of current cancer chemotherapeutic
agents are natural product derivatives, and natural
products represent valuable sources of bioactive
compounds, with many naturally-occurring compounds
and their synthetic analogs being developed for cancer
therapy and prevention in both preclinical and clinical
settings [1–2]. One such natural product with a long
history of chemopreventive usage is ginseng, which

cell lines, GS25 inhibited proliferation, induced cell cycle
arrest and apoptosis, and inhibited cell migration in vitro,
and exerted these effects while also preventing metastasis
in vivo [9]. In addition, GS25 sensitized prostate cancer
cells to chemotherapy and radiation therapy [10].
Our mechanistic studies have demonstrated that
inhibition of the MDM2 oncogene is one the major
mechanisms responsible for the anticancer activity of
GS25 [7–11]. The MDM2 oncogene is amplified and/
or overexpressed in many human cancers, including
prostate cancer [12–14]. We and other investigators
have demonstrated that MDM2 has both p53dependent and -independent oncogenic activities; it
is considered a promising molecule for developing
targeted cancer therapy and prevention approaches
[15–22]. Several MDM2 inhibitors under preclinical
and clinical development have been shown to have
excellent efficacy, including Nutlin-3 [23], RITA [24],
MI-219 [25], SP-141 [26–27], and JapA [28], although
their mechanisms of action vary. As a natural productderived MDM2 inhibitor, GS25 has dual inhibitory
functions, i.e., inhibiting MDM2 transcription and
inducing MDM2 protein autoubiquitination and
degradation [9], which is different from the other
reported MDM2 inhibitors. In addition, GS25 exerts
its MDM2 inhibitory activity and anticancer effects
in a p53-independent manner, which is critical, since
more than half of human cancers have p53 mutations or
dysfunctional p53.
GS25 is now under preclinical development as
a novel anticancer agent. However, as seen with other
natural compounds, its therapeutic applications are limited
by low aqueous solubility and instability under harsh
conditions, resulting in pharmacokinetic restrictions such
as low bioavailability by oral administration, extensive
metabolism, and rapid elimination [29]. An ideal solution
to the bioavailability problem is to develop a formulation
which protects the drug in its intact form and increases its
absorption and bio-stability. Recently, a self-emulsifying
drug delivery system (SEDDS) for GS25 was developed
to allow oral administration, but there was no evidence
of improved anticancer efficacy of the drug when it was
administered in an emulsion [30]. Therefore, it is of high
importance to develop an orally active formulation for
GS25 that can provide improved anticancer efficacy and
minimal toxicity.
Biodegradable polymeric nanoparticle-based drug
delivery systems are extensively used to improve the
bioavailability and enhance the efficacy of therapeutic
drugs. Encapsulation of drugs with nanoparticles
protects the molecules from premature degradation,
increases their solubility, promotes controlled drug
release, and improves drug targeting, often resulting
in improved therapeutic efficacy [31–32]. Different
materials, such as chitosan, cyclodextrins, polymers,
and dendrimers have been employed as carriers to

improve drug  bioavailability [33–34]. Among them,
Poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) is an efficient
carrier for the delivery of hydrophobic drugs and has
been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) for use in therapeutic formulations due to its
biodegradability and biocompatibility [35]. There is
increasing evidence that PLGA can efficiently improve
the aqueous solubility, permeability and bioavailability
of many potent drugs that are difficult to deliver orally,
such as curcumin and paclitaxel [35–37]. However, PLGA
nanoparticles exhibit short circulation times due to their
rapid clearance by cells of the mononuclear phagocytic
system (MPS) [38]. Surface coating nanoparticles with
hydrophilic polymers, such as polyethylene glycol (PEG),
sterically stabilizes the particles, leading to increased
plasma circulation and drug bioavailability, as well
as a prolonged half-life, improving the drug targeting
efficacy [39]. Therefore, in the present study, we designed
and prepared GS25-loaded PEG-PLGA nanoparticles
(GS25NP) in order to improve the oral bioavailability
of GS25.
The specific goals of the present study were to
design, prepare, and optimize the formulation for GS25
and to demonstrate that the new formulation increased the
oral absorption and improved the anticancer efficacy at
a low dose. The physicochemical and pharmacological
properties of GS25NP were evaluated both in vitro and
in vivo. In addition, a preliminary assessment of the safety
profile of GS25NP was accomplished. The investigation
described herein is highly significant, and is relevant to
the development of GS25 as a therapeutic agent for cancer
therapy and prevention.

RESULTS
Preparation and characterization of GS25loaded PEG-PLGA nanoparticles (GS25NP)
Both void PEG-PLGA nanoparticles (NPs) and
GS25-loaded nanoparticles (GS25NP) were prepared,
and representative diagrams showing the sizes and size
distributions of the void NPs and GS25NP by dynamic
light scattering (DLS) are presented in Figures 1A and 1B,
respectively. The narrow, monomodal particle size
distribution was further confirmed by transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) (Figures 1C and 1D). Both
DLS and TEM established that the average diameters
of the void NPs and GS25NP were ~ 43 nm, with a low
polydispersity (PDI = 0.3) (Figure 1E). The zeta potentials
of the void NPs and GS25NP were measured to be −13.2
and −12.0 mV, respectively (Figure 1E). The drug loading
and encapsulation efficiency of GS25NP was determined
to be 9.1% (w/w) and 89% (w/w), respectively, using an
established LC-MS/MS method [29].
The stability of GS25NP was assessed by measuring
the cumulative release of GS25 at physiological

pH condition (pH 7.4), in simulated intestinal fluid
(pH 6.8), and in simulated gastric fluid (pH 1.2). Over an
8 h period, 13.8%, 18.0%, and 27.9% of the total GS25
was released from the nanoparticles at pH 7.4, pH 6.8,
and pH 1.2, respectively, confirming that the majority of
GS25NP is stable under these conditions (Figure 1F). The
cumulative drug release after 24 h was found to be 24.5%,
29.5%, and 45.2%, respectively, at these pH values. There
was a steady release of GS25 over the next six days
(Figure 1F). This provides strong evidence that GS25NP
is able to allow sustained release of the compound in
both the stomach and intestine, protecting GS25 from
premature degradation.

drug were investigated using the Caco-2 cell line,
a well-characterized model for intestinal epithelial
permeability studies. As shown in Figure 2A, the
transepithelial transport of GS25 was significantly
enhanced by the nano-delivery system, in a timeand dose-dependent manner. After a 2 h incubation,
there was an approximately 6-fold increase in GS25
transport in the nanoparticle groups with both low and
high concentrations of GS25, compared to that for
GS25 alone. The apparent permeability coefficients
(Papp) of GS25 and GS25NP were 3.8 × 10−5 cm/s and
24.6 × 10−5 cm/s, respectively, indicating that there
was a carrier-mediated increase in the permeability of
GS25. The transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER)
was not significantly affected by GS25 and GS25NP
throughout the experiment, which suggested that the
increased  GS25 transport was not due to a decrease
in the monolayer integrity or the opening of tight
junctions.

protein content. D. Cells were incubated with free coumarin-6 or coumarin-6-loaded NPs for 2 h, then the cellular uptake was monitored by

were repeated three times. (*P < 0.05 and #P < 0.01).

In vitro cytotoxicity of GS25NP

The cellular uptake of GS25 and GS25NP was
subsequently investigated in the LNCaP, DU145, and
PC3 prostate cancer cell lines. As shown in Figure 2B, the
cellular uptake increased in a time-dependent manner for
both GS25 and GS25NP. Compared to that of free GS25,
there was an approximately three-fold high cellular uptake
of GS25NP in all three cell lines after a 2-h incubation.
Similarly, in the experiments using different doses of
GS25, the uptake of the drug into cancer cells was also
largely improved by the nano-delivery system (Figure 2C).
Furthermore, the nanoparticle-induced enhancement of the
cancer cell uptake of the encapsulated drug was confirmed
using coumarin-6 and coumarin-6-loaded NPs. The
fluorescence detection of this marker indicated that there
was a significant increase in the uptake of this compound
into all three prostate cancer cell lines (Figure 2D).
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Given the improved stability and cellular uptake
of GS25 by the nano-formulation, we further compared
the in vitro cytotoxicity of GS25 and GS25NP in prostate
cancer cells. Considering that GS25 is a natural MDM2
inhibitor that can exert its anticancer activity in a
p53-independent manner, three prostate cancer cell lines
with different p53 backgrounds were selected for this
study, i.e. LNCaP (p53 wild-type), DU145 (p53 mutant),
and PC3 (p53 null). As shown in Figures 3A and 3B,
the cell viability assays (24 h) for GS25 and GS25NP
revealed that nanoparticle encapsulation of GS25 resulted
in a ~ 50% decrease in the IC50 values compared with
free GS25 in all three cell lines. Similar results were
obtained after 48 and 72 h post-treatment, suggesting that

there was sustained release of GS25 from the nanoparticles
(Figure 3B).
We further compared the effects of GS25 and GS25NP
on apoptosis in these prostate cancer cell lines. A significant
enhancement of GS25-induced apoptosis by our delivery
system was observed in all three cell lines (Figure 3C). At a
concentration of 12.3 μg/mL, 48 h treatment with GS25NP
resulted in about 55.6%, 55.2%, and 48.2% apoptotic cells
in the LNCaP, DU145, and PC3 cell lines, respectively.
However, only 28.5%, 18.2%, and 22.9% of the free GS25treated cells underwent apoptosis. Consistent with the results
for apoptosis, GS25NP decreased MDM2 protein level and
increased the protein levels of the wild-type p53, Bax, and
cleaved-PARP at a very low concentration (2.5 μg/mL),
while the free GS25 did not produce significant effects on
these apoptosis-associated proteins at this concentration
(Figure 3D, compare intensity ratio of lane 2 with that of

the expression of the androgen receptor (AR) and prostatespecific antigen (PSA) in LNCaP cells.

In vivo pharmacokinetics of GS25NP
The in vivo pharmacokinetics of GS25 and GS25NP
were first assessed in male CD-1 mice. As shown in
Figures 4A and 4B, compared to the i.v. injection of
20 mg/kg GS25, oral administration of GS25 (100 mg/kg)
caused a very low peak value of drug concentration
(Cmax = 0.9 μg/mL) due to its low bioavailability (~ 14.9%).
The nanoparticle encapsulation of GS25 resulted in a
dramatically altered plasma concentration–time profile,
compared with that of free GS25. However, compared to
the oral administration of GS25 at the dose of 100 mg/kg,
the Cmax values for the oral administration of 20 and
100 mg/kg GS25NP were 3- and 9-fold higher,
respectively, indicating that the absorption of GS25
was greatly increased after it was encapsulated into

the nanoparticles. Similarly, compared to the oral
administration of GS25 (T1/2 = 2.1 h), the half-life for the
oral administration of GS25NP was extended to more than
7 h. Further, the AUC0-t values for the 20 and 100 mg/kg
oral doses of GS25NP increased to 21.4 and 93.1 h · μg/mL,
compared with that of the 100 mg/kg oral GS25
(3.5 h · μg/mL), which suggested that the encapsulation
greatly improved the oral bioavailability of GS25.
To further investigate the effects of nanoparticle
encapsulation on the tumor uptake of GS25 in vivo,
pharmacokinetic studies of GS25 and GS25NP were
performed in nude mice bearing PC3 xenograft tumors.
Consistent with the pharmacokinetic profiles in CD-1 mice,
encapsulation of GS25 into nanoparticles increased the
Cmax and prolonged the half-life in the plasma of nude
mice, indicating no significant strain-related variations
(Figure 4C). More importantly, there was a large increase
in the tumor uptake of GS25NP compared to GS25 alone
(Figure 4D). The Cmax was approximately 8-fold higher
for GS25NP compared to GS25, and both the half-life
and Tmax were extended, which allowed for better tumor
targeting of GS25NP than free GS25 in vivo. Selected
pharmacokinetic parameters for GS25 and GS25NP in
both mouse models are shown in Figure 4E.
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

The tissue biodistribution of GS25 and GS25NP
was also analyzed; the drug accumulation was increased
by the nano-delivery system in almost all of the tissues
tested, including liver, lungs, kidneys, spleen, heart, brain,
pancreas, and fat (Figure 5), except the gastrointestinal
(GI) tract (Figure 6). Although GS25NP had better stability
under physiological conditions, the drug concentrations
for GS25 (100 mg/kg) and GS25NP (100 mg/kg) in the
GI tract were almost the same (Figure 6), which further
confirmed the better absorption of GS25NP in the GI tract.

In vivo efficacy and toxicity of GS25NP
To determine the optimal therapeutic doses of GS25
and GS25NP for in vivo efficacy studies, initial maximum
tolerated dose (MTD) studies were performed in CD-1
mice. The results showed no toxicity to the mice at a dose
of up to 400 mg/kg of GS25 or GS25NP. No significant
decrease in mouse body weight or any other signs of
toxicity were observed. Further, a histological examination
of the various tissues (liver, lungs, kidneys, spleen, heart,
and brain) from mice treated with the vehicle, GS25, or
GS25NP showed no significant differences among the
groups (Figure 7).

The in vivo inhibition of MDM2 and increase in
apoptosis in tumor tissues were further confirmed by an
immunohistochemical analysis (Figure 8E). In addition,
there were no significant differences in the histological
findings between the control and various treatment
groups in any of the tissues examined (liver, lungs,
kidneys, spleen, heart, and brain), indicating that GS25NP
treatment was safe at therapeutic doses (Figure 9).

The anticancer efficacy of GS25 and GS25NP
was evaluated using the PC3 xenograft model of human
prostate cancer. As shown in Figures 8A and 8B,
100 mg/kg of GS25 had moderate effects on tumor
growth, and a 4-week oral treatment led to approximately
41% inhibition of the PC3 tumor growth. However,
treatment for the same period of time using 20 and
100 mg/kg of GS25NP inhibited the growth of PC3
xenograft tumors by approximately 75% and 87%,
respectively (Figures 8A and 8B). In addition, there were
no significant changes in the average body weights of the
mice in any of the treatment groups, suggesting that the
treatment did not lead to host toxicity (Figure 8C).
We further examined the expression levels of
MDM2 and other apoptosis-related proteins in vivo.

encapsulation also enhanced the effects of GS25 on the

models of human prostate cancer. We have made several
novel findings. First, an oral formulation of GS25 is
developed by employing biodegradable PEG-PLGA
copolymers, leading to the steady and sustained release
of GS25. Second, the nanoparticle encapsulation of GS25
protects this drug from premature degradation in the
stomach, increases its intestinal epithelial permeability,
and improves its cancer cell uptake in vitro and tumor
uptake in vivo. Third, this nanoparticle encapsulation
dramatically alters the pharmacokinetic profiles of GS25,
resulting in increased absorption, a prolonged half-life,
and improved oral bioavailability. Fourth, GS25NP shows
enhanced anticancer efficacy in vitro and in vivo, with
initial effects beginning at low concentrations, suggesting
that this nano-delivery system provides a remarkable dose
advantage. Finally, GS25 does not induce toxicity in mice
even at very high doses (up to 20-fold higher than the
effective dose). These results demonstrate that our newly
developed oral nano-formulation of GS25 improves its
drug-like properties and enhances its anticancer efficacy
without inducing toxicity, providing a basis for the
further development of this drug for cancer treatment and
prevention.

GS25 is a novel natural anticancer ginsenoside, and
has shown therapeutic efficacy in preclinical models of
several human cancers. There is an increasing interest
in developing GS25 as an agent for cancer therapy and
prevention due to its high efficacy and minimal toxicity.
However, the potential clinical translation of GS25 has
been limited by its poor bioavailability and short half-life,
which stem from the low aqueous solubility, poor
absorption, and instability under acidic conditions of this
compound. Oral delivery is the most commonly used
method of drug administration and it has a high level of
patient acceptance. Therefore, an oral delivery system for
GS25 is urgently needed for further development of this
compound. Although a SEDDS formulation was developed
for the oral administration of GS25, no evidence of the
efficacy of this delivery system has been reported yet.
Therefore, we have recently designed and developed an
oral nano-formulation of GS25, which directly improves
the bioavailability of the drug and significantly enhances
its anticancer efficacy in vitro and in vivo.
It is known that the poor absorption and limited
oral bioavailability of hydrophobic drugs, such as
GS25, is mainly due to the unfavorable physicochemical

properties as well as the GI mucus barriers [32]. Recently,
various types of nanocarriers, including nanoparticles of
biodegradable polymers are being developed to prevent
the drug degradation caused by low pH and enzymes of
the GI tract [40–42]. In the present study, to facilitate the
transition of GS25 from preclinical to clinical studies,
various FDA-approved nanoformulations, including
PLGA have been considered as potential carriers for
the oral delivery of this compound. Recent evidence
demonstrates that PLGA is a safe and efficient nanosystem
for the oral delivery of hydrophobic natural products,
resulting in improved bioavailability and enhanced
efficacy in vitro and in vivo [35–37]. Considering the
acidic nature of PLGA monomers, we therefore designed
and synthesized the PEG-PLGA nanoparticles for the
oral delivery of GS25. Our initial studies showed that
PEG-PLGA nanoparticles had high encapsulation
efficiency of GS25 and a sustained release up to
1 week. It also stabilized the compound in the GI tract,
increased plasma circulation, and prolonged half-life,
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

leading to the improved drug targeting efficacy and
bioavailability.
Although the tremendous nanotechnological
advances have allowed many methods available for
preparing nanoparticles, it is important to choose the
best preparation method of nanoparticles according to
the physicochemical properties of the drugs [40, 43–44].
Because GS25 is a liposoluble drug and has poor stability
in the acidic environment, several methods that can be
applied to this compound have been used to prepare PEGPLGA nanoparticles, including emulsification-diffusion,
solvent emulsion-evaporation, and nanoprecipitation.
We then compared the nanoparticle size distribution,
encapsulation efficiency, and the release kinetics of GS25loaded nanoparticles obtained using different methods.
Our results indicated that PEG-PLGA encapsulated GS25
successfully by nanoprecipitation method, having more
than 9% drug loading and 89% encapsulation efficiency
with an average particle size of 43 nm, which was in the
same range as reported in other studies using the same
21388

nanoprecipitation method [44–46]. More importantly,
the encapsulation of GS25 by PEG-PLGA nanoparticles
improved its anticancer activity and inhibitory effects on
MDM2, without disturbing its chemical structure.
In this study, we demonstrated that our novel
oral nano-delivery system for GS25 allows it to exert
substantial effects in a model of prostate cancer,
suggesting that the compound has great potential for
further development for use in the clinical setting. We
first demonstrated that GS25NP has a gradual, steady, and
sustained release profile under physiological conditions.
It has been reported that once orally delivered, GS25 starts
to be degraded in the stomach due to the acidic pH [29].
Our release kinetic studies in simulated physiological
media have indicated that the majority of GS25NP is
stable even under the harsh conditions of the stomach
(pH 1.2) and small intestine (pH 6.8), resulting in an
optimal release profile. Second, we demonstrated that
nanoparticle encapsulation optimizes the absorption and
bioavailability of GS25. Our studies using Caco-2 cell lines,
CD-1 mice, and nude mice bearing PC-3 xenografts have
shown that GS25NP has improved intestinal permeability,
increased drug accumulation in plasma and various tissues,
and an extended circulation lifetime, leading to optimal
pharmacokinetic and biodistribution profiles.
Third, we demonstrated that GS25NP has better
inhibitory effects on MDM2 in vitro and in vivo.
Assays for the protein expression of MDM2 and other
apoptosis regulators have indicated that GS25NP
initiates its effects at a low dose, at which GS25 was not
effective for inhibiting MDM2 either in vitro or in vivo.
These results have been attributed to the increase in cancer
cell uptake and tumor penetration of GS25NP. Fourth, we
demonstrated that GS25NP has better in vitro and in vivo
efficacy than free GS25. Our results have shown that
GS25NP starts to inhibit prostate cancer cell viability at
very low dose levels in vitro and in vivo, independent of
the p53 status of the cells. These findings make it clear
that this oral delivery system contributes to improving
the efficacy of GS25 through various aspects, including
the various factors mentioned above. Of note, our initial
MTD studies indicated that GS25NP has a favorable
safety profile and leads to no mortality even at a high dose
of 400 mg/kg/d (administered for 7 days). No significant
morphological changes were seen in various tissues
obtained from these mice. Furthermore, we have found
that there were no significant changes in the body weight
or tissue morphology in nude mice bearing PC3 xenograft
tumors after a 4-week treatment with GS25 (100 mg/kg)
or GS25NP (20 and 100 mg/kg). However, further
investigations on the long-term oral toxicity of GS25NP
are needed.
In summary, we have prepared and characterized
an oral nano-delivery system for a novel natural
MDM2 inhibitor, GS25, and herein demonstrated

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

its pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and safety in various
preclinical models of human prostate cancer. These
outcomes suggest that the newly developed oral
formulation may have direct practical implications for
developing GS25 as an agent for cancer therapy and
prevention.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell lines and cell culture
Human prostate cancer cell lines LNCaP
(p53 wild-type), DU145 (p53 mutant), and PC3 (p53 null)
and human intestinal epithelial cell line Caco-2 were
purchased from the American Type Culture Collection
(Rockville, MD, USA). LNCaP cells were cultured in
RPMI 1640 medium. PC3 cells were grown in Ham’s
F-12 medium. DU145 and Caco-2 cells were cultured in
Eagle’s minimum essential medium (EMEM). All cell
culture media contained 10% fetal bovine serum and
1% penicillin/streptomycin.

PEG-PLGA polymers, chemicals, antibodies,
and other reagents
The novel agent, 25-OCH3-PPD (GS25), was
isolated and characterized as described in our earlier
studies [5–6]. All chemicals and solvents were of the
highest grade available. The m-polyethyleneglycolpolylactic-glycolic acid [mPEG (MW = 5,000 Da)PLGA (50:50; MW = 45,000 Da)] polymers were
purchased from Advanced Polymer Materials Inc.
(Montreal, Canada). Acetone and poly-vinyl alcohol
(PVA) were purchased from Sigma (St Louis, MO, USA).
The anti-human p53, Bax, and PARP antibodies were
from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (Dallas, TX, USA).
The anti-human MDM2 antibody was from Calbiochem
(Billerica, MA, USA). The anti-human PSA and AR
antibodies were purchased from BD Pharmingen (San
Diego, CA, USA).

Preparation of PEG-PLGA nanoparticles
A total of 40 mg of PEG-PLGA polymers and 5 mg
of GS25 were dissolved in 4 mL of acetone and then added
drop-wise under rigorous mixing into 40 mL of DD H2O
containing 0.5% PVA. The mixture was then sonicated
for 5 min in a bath sonicator. The organic solvent in the
mixture was evaporated by continuous stirring overnight.
The resultant solution was centrifuged and washed with
water twice to remove free drug, and the precipitate
was resuspended in 5 mL of water. Finally, nanoparticle
suspensions were freeze-dried for 48 h and stored at 4°C.
Blank nanoparticles were produced in a similar manner
without adding the drug.

Analyses of the particle size, zeta potential, and
morphology of PEG-PLGA nanoparticles

Caco-2 cell monolayer permeability assay
The Caco-2 cell monolayer permeability assay was
performed as reported previously [48]. In brief, Caco-2
cells were seeded onto polycarbonate 6-well Transwell®
inserts (mean pore size 3.0 μm, Corning Costar Inc., NY,
USA) at a density of 4 × 105 cells/well, then the confluent
monolayers (10–12 days) were used for permeability
studies. The transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER)
of the monolayer was measured using an epithelial
voltohmmeter (EVOM, WPI Inc., USA) to determine
the formation of the monolayer and its integrity during
the experiment. The studies were carried out in HBSS
containing 30 mM HEPES at pH 6.0. Monolayers were
washed with HBSS prior to the experiment, after which
0.5 and 1.2 mL of HBSS was placed into the upper and
lower compartments, respectively. A total volume of
100 μL of solution (1 or 5 μg/mL) was taken from the
lower compartment at regular intervals over 120 min and
replaced with the same volume of fresh buffer, followed by
a LC-MS/MS analysis. Apparent permeability coefficients
(Papp) were calculated using the equation: (∂Q/∂t)/(A*C0),
where “∂Q/∂t” is the permeability rate of the drug across
the cells, “A” is the diffusion area of the monolayer and
“C0” is the initial concentration of GS25 in the upper
compartment.

The size distribution and zeta potential of
PEG-PLGA nanoparticles in water with 0.05% Tween 80
were determined using dynamic light scattering (Zetasizer
3000HS, Malvern Instruments Ltd, UK). The particle size
was determined using a He-Ne laser beam at a wavelength
of 633 nm with a fixed scattering angle of 90° at 25°C.
The data were evaluated using the volume distribution.
The zeta potential values were measured at the default
parameters of the dielectric constant, refractive index,
and viscosity of water, using a disposable capillary cell
with a volume of 1 mL at 25°C. The morphology of the
PEG-PLGA nanoparticles was examined by transmission
electron microscopy (Hitachi H-9500, Hitachi High
Technologies America, Inc. Dallas, TX, USA). Freezedried nanoparticles were dissolved in water with
0.05% Tween 80, and a small droplet was placed on a
carbon-coated copper grid, followed by drying at room
temperature before measurements were taken.

Characterization of the drug loading and
encapsulation efficiency of GS25NP
The drug loading and encapsulation efficiency of
GS25NP were determined using the previously reported
methods [47]. Briefly, 1 mg of freeze-dried GS25NP
was dissolved in 1 mL of methanol and the mixture was
incubated for 1 h in a 37°C water bath for complete
extraction of GS25 into methanol. The solutions were
centrifuged at 13,500 rpm for 5 min, and the amount
of GS25 in the supernatant was determined using an
LC-MS/MS method established in our previous study [29].
The drug loading and encapsulation efficiency were
defined as the ratio of the amount of GS25 encapsulated
in nanoparticles to the total amount of GS25NPs, and the
ratio of the amount of encapsulated GS25 to that initially
added in the process, respectively.

Analysis of the cellular uptake of GS25NP
The uptake of GS25NP into prostate cancer
cells was determined by a LC-MS/MS analysis and
fluorescence detection [28–29]. Briefly, LNCaP, DU145,
and PC3 cells were incubated with 10 μg/mL of GS25 or
GS25NP for 0.5, 1, and 2 h or with 1, 5, and 10 μg/mL
of GS25 or GS25NP for 1 h. Cells were then washed with
cold PBS and kept at −80°C overnight for cell lysis. GS25
and cellular proteins were extracted by sonication for
1 min and centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 10 min. The
amount of GS25 in the cell lysates was quantified by a
LC-MS/MS analysis and normalized to the protein content
in each sample. For fluorescence detection, cells were
incubated with coumarin-6 or coumarin-6-loaded NPs for
2 h and were fixed using 4% formalin in PBS. Cells were
counterstained with DAPI and analyzed under an Olympus
fluorescence microscope (Olympus America Inc).

In vitro release kinetic studies of GS25NP
The cumulative release of GS25 from GS25NP was
studied in simulated gastric fluid (PBS adjusted to pH
1.2 with HCL), simulated intestinal fluid (PBS at pH 6.8)
without enzymes and in PBS (pH 7.4). Briefly, 10 mg of
GS25NP was dissolved in 1 mL of simulated fluid or PBS
and sealed in a dialysis bag with a molecular weight cut-off
of 10,000–13,000 Da. The dialysis bags were placed in
50 mL of release medium containing 0.05% Tween 80 at
37°C. The release medium (about 0.2 mL) was withdrawn
at predetermined time intervals (15, 30, and 60 min, and
1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, 144, and 168 h). The
collected samples were analyzed using the established
LC-MS/MS method [29].

In vitro cytotoxicity studies
Assays for cell viability and apoptosis were
performed as described previously [28, 49]. In brief,
3–4 × 104 cells were seeded in a 96-well plate and treated
with various concentrations of GS25 or GS25NP for
24, 48, or 72 h for the MTT assay. To detect apoptosis,
2–3 × 105 cells were seeded in 6-well plates and were
treated with GS25 or GS25NP for 48 h. Cells positive for

Annexin V-FITC and PI were counted on a BD FACSVerse
instrument (BD Biosciences, CA, USA).

(57.1:14.3:28.6, v/v/v) was administered at a dose of
100 mg/kg/d for 4 weeks. The control groups received
vehicle only or void NPs. At the end of the experiment,
xenograft tumors and various organs (liver, lungs,
kidneys, spleen, heart, and brain) were excised and
snap frozen for Western blotting, immunohistochemical
studies, TUNEL assays, and hematoxylin and eosin
staining.

Western blotting analysis
In the in vitro studies, prostate cancer cells with
or without GS25 or GS25NP treatment were lysed
in NP40 lysis buffer containing a protease inhibitor
mixture (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA). In the in vivo
studies, tumor tissues were removed and homogenized
in NP40 lysis buffer (100 mg tumor tissue/1 mL NP40
buffer), and the supernatants of the homogenates was
collected. Then, the cell lysates and tumor homogenates
were subjected to Western blotting analyses for the
expression levels of MDM2 and other related proteins
using the methods described in our previous studies
[26–27, 50].

Pharmacokinetic and biodistribution
studies of GS25NP
Pharmacokinetic studies were carried out in normal
CD-1 mice and nude mice bearing PC3 xenograft tumors
as described previously [51–52]. Briefly, male CD-1
mice were divided randomly into four groups with three
mice per time point. One group received 20 mg/kg of
GS25 in PEG400:EtOH:saline by intravenous injection
into the tail vein. One group of mice received GS25 in
PEG400:EtOH:saline (57.1:14.3:28.6, v/v/v) at a dose of
100 mg/kg by oral administration. Two groups received
GS25NP at a dose of 20 mg/kg and 100 mg/kg by oral
administration. Nude mice bearing PC3 xenografts were
divided into two groups and given GS25 and GS25NP at
a dose of 100 mg/kg by oral administration. For orallydosed mice, the plasma and various tissues (tumor, liver,
lungs, kidneys, spleen, heart, brain, pancreas, fat, stomach,
stomach contents, small intestine, small intestine contents,
large intestine, and large intestine contents) were collected
at 0, 15, 30, and 60 min, and 2, 4, 8, 24, 48, and 72 h after
treatment. For mice that received an i.v. injection, various
tissues were collected at 0, 5, 10, 30, and 60 min, and 2, 4,
8, 24, 48, and 72 h after treament. The plasma and tissue
samples were stored at −80°C until they were analyzed by
LC-MS/MS.

Determination of the maximum tolerated
dose (MTD)
To assess the possible host toxicity of GS25 and
GS25NP and establish initial doses for in vivo treatment,
a multi-dose MTD study was initially performed for both
GS25 and GS25NP at a dose of 200 mg/kg for 7 days.
Mice were monitored for mortality, body weight changes,
and changes in physical appearance, with no signs of
toxicity being observed at this dose. The toxicity studies
were continued with dose of 400 mg/kg/d for 7 days using
a similar protocol. At the end of the study, all mice were
euthanized, and various tissues (liver, lungs, kidneys,
spleen, heart, and brain) were collected for a pathological
analysis.

Determination of the in vivo efficacy of GS25NP
in a prostate cancer xenograft model

Immunohistochemistry, TUNEL assay, and
pathological analysis

The animal study protocol was approved by the
Institutional Animal Use and Care Committee of the
Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center. Male
athymic pathogen-free nude mice (nu/nu, 4–6 weeks)
were  purchased from Charles River Laboratories
(Wilmington, MA). The PC3 human prostate cancer
xenografts were established as reported previously
[26–27, 50]. Briefly, a total of 5 × 106 PC3 cells (in 0.1 mL)
were subcutaneously injected into the left inguinal
area of the mice. All animals were monitored for
activity, physical condition, body weight, and
tumor growth. When the tumor volume reached
~ 100 mm3, the mice bearing PC3 xenografts were
randomly divided into treatment and control groups
(10 mice/each group). GS25NP was dissolved
in water and administered by oral gavage at a
dose of 20 mg/kg/d or 100 mg/kg/d, 5 day/week
for 4 weeks, while GS25 in PEG400:EtOH:saline

All of the staining assays were performed as
described previously [50]. Briefly, tissues were fixed and
embedded in paraffin, cut into 5 μm sections, and then
affixed onto glass slides. For the immunohistochemical
studies, the tumor sections were blocked and incubated
with a biotinylated anti-human MDM2 antibody (diluted
1:50 in 5% BSA in PBS) for 1–2 h at room temperature.
Sections were then incubated with pre-diluted
streptavidin-peroxidase HRP conjugates and stained
with DAB chromogen according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Finally, sections were lightly counterstained
with hematoxylin. To detect apoptosis, tumor sections
were stained with a TdT-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end
labeling (TUNEL)-based In Situ Apoptosis Detection
kit (Trevigen, Inc, Gaithersburg, MD) according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. For hematoxylin and

eosin staining, the paraffin-embedded tissue sections
were deparaffinized and stained with hematoxylin for
10 minutes and eosin for 1 minute. Tissue sections were
analyzed under a phase-contrast Olympus microscope
(Olympus America Inc).
