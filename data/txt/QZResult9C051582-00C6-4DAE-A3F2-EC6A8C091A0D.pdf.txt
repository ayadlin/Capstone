BACKGROUND: The incidence, epidemiology, Candida species distribution, resistance patterns, and outcome of candidemia in high-risk hematologic malignancy and/or stem cell transplantation patients have
not been extensively described since the introduction of new antifungal agents. METHODS: In this retrospective study, the authors reviewed the medical records and microbiologic data of hematologic malignancy patients with candidemia at The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center from March 2001
to February 2007. RESULTS: The authors analyzed 173 episodes of candidemia (170 patients), 125 (72%) of
which were breakthrough cases after prior antifungal agents, mainly fluconazole (28 [22%]), caspofungin
(25 [20%]), and voriconazole (18 [14%]). The incidence of candidemia (per 100,000 inpatient days)
remained relatively stable, from 13.9 in 2001 to 19.2 in 2006. However, compared with the findings of previous studies at the authors’ institution, the frequency of Candida glabrata and C. krusei infection decreased
(to 5% and 17%, respectively) and C. parapsilosis (24%) and C. tropicalis (21%) increased. C. parapsilosis fungemia was associated with prior caspofungin use (P < .001). The overall 30-day crude mortality rate was
38%, and the attributable mortality rate was 19%, similar to previous findings at the authors’ institution. The
Candida species associated with the highest mortality rate was C. glabrata. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the
widespread use of antifungal prophylaxis and the introduction of new antifungal agents, the incidence and
associated mortality rates of candidemia remained stable in high-risk hematologic malignancy patients.
However, its epidemiological characteristics have shifted, with C. parapsilosis and C. tropicalis becoming

decline coincided with a proportional increase in the percentage of bloodstream infections caused by non-albicans
Candida species, including fluconazole-resistant C. glabrata and C. krusei, which now account for most candidemia episodes in many cancer centers.4 Relatively little is
known, however, about the contemporary epidemiological characteristics and clinical outcome of candidemia in
cancer patients.
Candidemia is associated with excess morbidity and
mortality, longer hospital stay, and higher hospital costs,
especially in severely immunosuppressed patients with
hematologic malignancies.5 During the past decade, new
antifungal therapies have been introduced with improved
spectra: echinocandins and voriconazole. Despite an everexpanding anti-Candida armamentarium, there are no
recent large studies of the incidence, microbiologic characteristics, resistance patterns, and clinical outcome of
candidemia among patients with hematologic malignancies or those who have undergone hematopoietic stem cell
transplantation (HSCT). Randomized clinical trials of
candidemia treatment typically exclude neutropenic or
otherwise heavily immunosuppressed patients with hematologic malignancies.6,7 In this retrospective study, we
reviewed our recent experience with candidemia in hematologic malignancy patients at a large tertiary-care cancer
hospital.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
This study was designed as a retrospective cohort study.
All adults with hematologic malignancies and at least 1
blood culture positive for Candida spp. were identified by
searching the microbiology laboratory database at The
University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center
(Houston, Tex) from March 1, 2001 to February 28,
2007. Patient chart data were reviewed and entered into a
database using a standardized data collection form. We
collected information regarding patient demographics,
underlying malignancy, presence of a central venous catheter (CVC), neutropenia, use of adrenal corticosteroids
(within 4 weeks before the onset of candidemia), and history of HSCT. Information concerning Candida species,
intensive care unit admission, antifungal agent use within
1 week before the onset of candidemia, and intercurrent
infection during the candidemia episode was also
collected. The Acute Physiology and Chronic Health
4746

Evaluation II (APACHE II) score was calculated for each
patient at the onset of candidemia. Quantitative culture
data (colony-forming units [CFU]/mL) were also
recorded for the primary bloodstream culture. Minimum
inhibitory concentration (MIC) of antifungal agents were
determined using the standard Clinical and Laboratory
Standards Institute protocol.8 Our microbiology methods
were unchanged throughout the study period. We also
collected data on use of hematopoietic growth factors,
time of CVC removal, and resolution of neutropenia.
Candidemia was defined according to published
guidelines.9 Episodes of candidemia in a single patient
were considered distinct if they were separated by at
least a 30-day period during which no blood or sterile
site cultures were positive for Candida spp. De novo,
breakthrough, and persistent candidemia; neutropenia;
and Candida-attributable mortality were defined as previously described.10 Catheter-associated candidemia was
diagnosed when there was no other apparent source of
infection and the same Candida spp. was isolated from
both the peripheral blood and the catheter-tip culture
(15 CFUs using the semiquantitative method); or
when a quantitative blood culture collected through
the CVC had at least 5-fold more CFU/mL than a
concurrent peripheral blood culture.11 We also considered an episode to be catheter-associated if the patient
had sustained candidemia that resolved after removal
of the CVC within 3 days of the first positive blood
culture. Treatment response was evaluated on Days 7
and 14 of therapy as clinical and/or mycologic
response (when subsequent blood cultures were drawn).
The study protocol was reviewed and approved by The
M. D. Anderson Cancer Center Institutional Review
Board.

Statistical Analysis
Data were analyzed to assess potential clinical factors associated with mortality in the patient cohort. Categorical
variables were compared using Fisher exact test, and continuous variables were compared using Student t test or
the Mann-Whitney U test where appropriate. All comparisons were unpaired, and tests for significance were
2-tailed; P values of <.5 were considered to indicate statistical significance. Multivariate logistic regression analysis
was used to identify variables independently associated

between 2001 to 2007 is shown.

RESULTS
Enrollment and Demographics
Over the 7-year period, 173 episodes of candidemia were
detected in 170 patients with hematologic malignancies,
spanning 8804 inpatient days. Patients’ demographic,
clinical, and microbiologic characteristics are shown in
Table 1. Most patients (125 [72%]) developed candidemia while being treated with antifungal agents, typically
for prophylaxis (82 of 173 [47%]) or presumed (41
[24%]) or documented aspergillosis (2 [2%]). Prior antifungal agents included fluconazole (28 of 125 [22%]),
itraconazole (22 [18%]), caspofungin (25 [20%]), voriconazole (18 [14%]), and liposomal amphotericin B (16
[13%]). Combination antifungal therapy was prescribed
in 13 (10%) patients. Of the 125 patients with breakthrough candidemia on antifungal therapy, 69 (55%) had
CVC-related candidemia.

episodes (ie, 2 different Candida species in the same blood
culture) were observed in 3 patients. In 30 (17%) patients,
blood cultures yielded both Candida species and bacteria.
Twenty-five patients developed candidemia while receiving caspofungin. In those patients, the most common
Candida isolate was C. parapsilosis (13 patients, CVCassociated in 10), followed by C. tropicalis,4 C. albicans,3
and C. krusei.3 In univariate analysis, candidemia caused
by C. parapsilosis was more common in candidemic
patients who were receiving caspofungin than in patients
receiving other therapy (13 of 25 [52%] vs 29 of 148
[20%], respectively; P ¼ .0016).
Of the 168 Candida isolates tested, 48 (29%) were
resistant or susceptible-dose–dependent in vitro to fluconazole and 88 (52%) to itraconazole. Few isolates (4%)
exhibited amphotericin B MIC values >1 lg/mL.12,13
For voriconazole, posaconazole, and caspofungin, the
nonsusceptibility rates were 8%, 6%, and 5%, respectively, based on proposed susceptibility breakpoints.12,13
It should be noted that the number of isolates tested for
susceptibility to newer antifungal agents is lower, because
of later introduction of these drugs into clinical practice.
Antifungal resistance was more common among nonalbicans Candida spp. than among C. albicans. No distinct pattern of antifungal nonsusceptibility was evident
during the 7-year study period.

The most common treatment strategies after the diagnosis
of candidemia were removal of the CVC within 3 days
(58%) and concomitant antifungal treatment using agents
different from those given previously (103 [60%]). Other
options were continuation of previous antifungal therapy
(34 [20%]) and the addition of another antifungal agent
(29 [17%]). Seven (4%) patients received no antifungal
therapy. Candidemia was initially treated with only 1
antifungal agent (monotherapy) in 74 (43%) patients and
with combination therapy in 60 (35%). Thirty-two
(18%) patients received at least 2 consecutive regimens
because of clinical failure or side effects of the initial antifungal regimen. The antifungal agents used as initial
monotherapy were caspofungin (21 of 173 candidemia
episodes [12%]), formulations of amphotericin B (20
[12%]), voriconazole (15 [9%]), fluconazole (11[6%]),
itraconazole (4 [2%]), anidulafungin (1 [1%]), and micafungin (1 [1%]). The antifungal agents used in combination regimens in initial treatment were caspofungin (68
[39%]), liposomal amphotericin B (63 [36%]), voriconazole (26 [15%]), fluconazole (21 [12%]), anidulafungin
(3 [2%]), itraconazole (1 [1%]), and micafungin (1
[1%]). The clinical response rate to antifungal therapy at
Day 7 was 35% to 100% (Table 3).
Outcome
The overall mortality rate was 16% at Day 7 after the
index blood culture for Candida, 26% at Day 14, and

Day 7, 16% at Day 14, and 19% at Day 30. Of 33 deaths
attributed to candidemia, 28 (84%) occurred by Day 14.
The Candida species associated with the highest crude
and attributable mortality rates at Day 30 was C. glabrata,
followed by C. krusei (Fig. 2).
A bivariate analysis showed that the factors associated with crude mortality at Day 14 were an APACHE II
score 20, intensive care unit admission, and high fungal
burden (>100 CFUs/mL) in the peripheral blood,
whereas polymorphonuclear recovery and CVC removal
within 3 days were associated with improved outcome. In
the multivariate analysis, the independent factors associated with Day 14 mortality were high fungal burden (P ¼
.021; odds ratio [OR], 7.21; 95% confidence interval
[CI], 1.35-38.4) and lack of polymorphonuclear neutrophilic leukocyte recovery (P ¼ .024; OR, 0.149; 95% CI,
0.029-0.779). In the 30-day mortality bivariate analysis
(Table 4), age >50 years, intercurrent bacterial infection,
neutrophil count <100/mL at diagnosis, a high APACHE
II score, use of broad-spectrum antibiotics before the diagnosis of candidemia, and breakthrough infection (vs de
novo infection) were associated with adverse outcome.
The time from positive blood culture to initiation of antifungal therapy did not emerge as a risk factor for mortality, as many patients were receiving active antifungal
therapy at the time of diagnosis. In contrast, neutrophil
recovery and new antifungal therapy (vs continuation of
previous therapy or addition of another antifungal agent)
were associated with improved outcome. Six variables
were examined in the final model for Day 30 mortality:

DISCUSSION
To our knowledge, this is the largest recent retrospective
study of candidemia in unselected hematologic cancer
patients. The inclusion period of March 2001 to February
2007 is unique because of the introduction of new antifungal agents such as echinocandins and voriconazole during that time in our institution. In fact, 1=3 of patients in
our study were receiving caspofungin or voriconazole at
the onset of candidemia, and most had received echinocandin or voriconazole as monotherapy or as part of combination therapy after the diagnosis of candidemia. In
contrast, treatment with fluconazole comprised the minority of cases.
The incidence of candidemia during the study period ranged from 13.9 to 23.2 cases per 100,000 inpatient
days. These rates are higher than those reported from
multi-institutional European surveys (0.26 to 0.73 per
10,000 inpatient days)14 and United States-based
4749

Original Article

surveillance studies (1.5 cases per 10,000 inpatient
days),15 probably because most of our patients were heavily immunosuppressed. Interestingly, the widespread use
of older and newer antifungal agents as prophylaxis
among patients with hematologic malignancies did not
result in a decreased candidemia incidence. Our data do
not exclude the possibility that the observed incidence of
microbiologically documented candidemia is an underestimation of the real incidence because the autopsy rate in
this patient population is low at our institution.16,17
In accordance with the findings of several other
studies conducted at our hospital18,19 and elsewhere,20,21
our results confirmed the shift in the distribution of candidemia-associated Candida species to non-albicans species (74%). In older studies, this shift was attributed to the
widespread use of fluconazole, although broad-spectrum
antibiotics and chemotherapy regimens may also contribute to the species isolated.22–24 In our study, only 50
patients (29%) were receiving fluconazole or itraconazole
at the onset of candidemia. This decline in fluconazole
usage did not influence the non-albicans Candida spp.
predominance.
In our institution, changes in the frequency of
specific non-albicans Candida spp. were observed: the
frequency of C. glabrata declined and that of C. parapsilosis increased (Table 2). Although the exact causes of this
shift remain unclear, the decline in fluconazole or itraconazole usage in favor of echinocandins and voriconazole
as prophylactic agents may have contributed to this epidemiologic change. A recent study showed significant correlation between increased caspofungin usage and an
increased incidence of C. parapsilosis candidemia.25 The
emergence of C. parapsilosis in this era of frequent echinocandin use is noteworthy, as this Candida species was isolated in 53% of patients who developed candidemia while
receiving caspofungin. An interesting finding of our study
was the high proportion (59%) of catheter-related candidemia episodes. In previous studies, CVCs were considered to be uncommon sources of breakthrough fungemia
in hematologic malignancy patients.4 However, it is possible that the combination of CVCs and selection pressure
(because of the frequent use of echinocandins) resulted in
the rise of C. parapsilosis, a Candida species that has intrinsic resistance to echinocandins26 and is known to adhere
to the surface of CVCs through a fibrin sheath and thus
cause candidemia.27
4750

In vitro susceptibility studies of Candida isolates
have shown that their resistance and dose-dependent
susceptibility to older triazoles (fluconazole and itraconazole) are high (29% and 52%, respectively) but not
higher than those observed at our institution from 1998
to 2001,19 despite the widespread use of antifungal prophylaxis. Similar results were reported in an 8.5-year
analysis of the susceptibility of Candida spp. to fluconazole.12 In vitro resistance to amphotericin B and the
antifungal agents introduced into clinical practice after
2000 (caspofungin, voriconazole, and posaconazole) was
uncommon. It is noteworthy that despite the lack of
increase in fluconazole resistance rates at our institution,
there was a shift in the epidemiological characteristics of
candidemia, with a decreased frequency of fluconazoleresistant Candida spp., such as C. glabrata and C. krusei.
This finding suggests that resistance to antifungal agents
is not the only driving force for changes in Candida’s
epidemiology.
Crude and attributable mortality rates in hematological patients with candidemia have remained persistently high, and similar to those reported in older
studies,28 despite the introduction of new antifungal
agents. In addition, the increasing use of combination
antifungal therapy at our institution (60 [35%] patients)
was not associated with a significant improvement in mortality rates, independent of the severity of the illness.
These data, along with the high early mortality rate (26%
by Day 14) and poor clinical response to antifungal therapy (50% at Day 7), suggest that candidemia is a hallmark
of severe illness and debilitation in hematologic malignancy patients and is associated with increased mortality
rates, irrespective of antifungal treatment.
A multivariate analysis showed that a high fungal
burden in the peripheral blood was associated with a high
early mortality rate. Therefore, quantitative blood cultures may be useful as prognostic markers of candidemia
among patients with hematologic malignancies. Neutrophil recovery was an independent predictor of low early
mortality rates, as has been shown in previous studies.29 It
is also noteworthy that CVC removal within 3 days had a
positive effect on early mortality rates. This is consistent
with a previous study in cancer patients that showed that
catheter removal 72 hours after onset improved
response to antifungal therapy in patients with CVCrelated candidemia.30

There were several limitations to our study. Its retrospective nature did not allow the assessment of other
potentially important parameters, such as the presence
and severity of mucositis, visceral dissemination, exposure
to antifungal agents during the 30 days before the onset of
candidemia, more information on CVCs (ie, tunneled or
not, placement techniques, hand hygiene status), and
underlying disease activity. In addition, the study was
conducted at a single tertiary-care cancer center; consequently, it may not reflect local practice patterns and may
not be applicable to all hematologic malignancy or transplantation patients. Finally, we did not include autopsy
data; therefore, the incidence of candidemia in the study
population may have been underestimated. Conversely,
we did not use exclusion criteria; therefore, this study
presents ‘‘real-life’’ clinical practice data.
In conclusion, the epidemiology of candidemia in
high-risk hematologic malignancy patients continues to
evolve. The introduction of new antifungal agents into
clinical practice at our institution did not reduce the incidence of candidemia or the predominance of non-albicans
Candida spp. among patients with hematologic malignancies. Moreover, these changes in antifungal prescribing
patterns were associated with a reduction in the incidence
of C. glabrata and C. krusei, with a parallel increase in the
incidence of C. parapsilosis and C. tropicalis. The use of
newer antifungal agents in the treatment of candidemia
did not reduce the overall and Candida-attributable mortality rates. The results of this study suggest that patients’
outcomes are heavily dependent on the underlying hematologic malignancy, severity of immunosuppression, and
presence of indwelling devices, a site where modern antifungal agents, especially azoles, fail to eradicate Candida.31 These findings highlight the challenges of defining
optimal management in this high-risk patient population,
which typically is not included in modern candidemia
trials.
