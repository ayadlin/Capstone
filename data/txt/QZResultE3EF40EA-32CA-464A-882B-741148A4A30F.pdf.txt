ABSTRACT
Multi-drug resistance (MDR) remains a great obstacle to effective chemotherapy
for gastric cancer. A number of secreted glycoproteins have been reported to be
involved in the development of MDR in gastric cancer. However, whether glycosylation
of secreted glycoproteins changes during MDR of gastric cancer is unclear. Our present
work manifested that N-glycosites and site-specific glycoforms of secreted proteins
in drug-resistant cell lines were distinctly different from those in the parental cell
line for the first time. Further characterization highlighted the significance of some
aberrantly glycosylated secretory proteins in MDR, suggesting that manipulating the
glycosylation of specific glycoproteins could be a potential target for overcoming
multi-drug resistance in gastric cancer.

INTRODUCTION

that could modulate the development of MDR in gastric
cancer [4–8]. Besides, a growing number of researches
concerning the role of tumor microenvironment in MDR
declare that macrophages, T cells, fibroblasts and ECM
(extracellular matrix) within tumor microenvironment
could contribute to MDR of multiple cancers by direct and
indirect interactions with tumor cells [9–12]. As critical
components of the tumor microenvironment, secreted
proteins of tumor cells also have been demonstrated to be
greatly involved in chemoresistance. Targeted therapy with
BRAF, ALK or EGFR kinase inhibitors induces a complex
network of secreted factors in human melanoma and lung
adenocarcinoma cells, and this therapy-induced secretome
stimulates the outgrowth and dissemination of drugresistant cancer cells and promotes the survival of drugsensitive cancer cells [13]. Besides, extracellular vesicles
derived from drug-resistant cancer cells could confer drug
resistance on drug-sensitive cancer cells [14, 15]. Secreted
clusterin (sCLU) was reported to contribute to MDR of
several cancers such as osteosarcoma and hepatocellular
carcinoma [16, 17]. In another example, secreted sonic
hedgehog was proved to be of great significance in the

Gastric cancer (GC) ranks the second most
commonly diagnosed malignancy and the second most
lethal cancer in China [1]. Despite the great improvements
in diagnostic and therapeutic techniques of gastric
cancer, the 5-year overall survival of GC patients still
remains unsatisfactory. And, the emergence of multi-drug
resistance (MDR) is largely responsible for the dismal
long term survival of GC patients [2].
To date, there have been extensive studies on the
mechanism of MDR. And, a number of molecules such as
ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters have been found
to be involved in the development of MDR [3]. To explore
the underlying mechanisms of MDR in GC, the multidrug resistant cell lines, SGC7901/ADR and SGC7901/
VCR, were derived from human gastric adenocarcinoma
cell line SGC7901 by stepwise selection with adriamycin
and vincristine respectively in our lab. Based on these
drug-resistant cell models, we have discovered a series
of microRNAs (miR-19a/b, miR-508-5p, miR-27b, miR129-5p) and proteins (HIF-1α, MGr1-Ag/37LRP, CCNG1)

development of MDR in multiple myeloma [18]. As for
gastric cancer, Yuan et al. claimed that WNT6, a secreted
glycoprotein, promoted multi-drug resistance of gastric
cancer [19], and Cho et al. indicated that VEGF-C
secretion contributed to chemoresistance of gastric cancer
to cisplatin [20]. More importantly, the proteomic research
accomplished by Huang et al. reported that secreted
proteins were quite different between drug-sensitive and
drug-resistant gastric cancer cell lines [21].
As one of the most abundant post-translational
modifications (PTMs), glycosylation exercises great
influences on not only structures but also functions of
glycoproteins. Our previous study demonstrated that P-gp,
a pivotal player in MDR, was aberrantly glycosylated in
MDR gastric cancer cell lines and glycosylation at Asn99
residue might greatly affect its function in MDR [22].
Intriguingly, recent researches indicated that glycomic
alterations of glycoproteins exerted enormous effects on
chemoresistance of cancers. Lattova et al. verified the
correlations between N-glycosylation variations and the
efficacy of chemotherapies in breast cancer cells [23, 24]
and discovered that the emergence of galactosylated or
biantennary fucosylated glycans might be associated with
chemoresistance. Besides, Nakano et al. observed that
α 2–6 sialylation of N-glycans decreased with acquired
resistance to desoxyepothilone B in leukemia cells [25].
Yet, the former researches mainly focused on glycosites
or glycan structures. But, there are many glycosites in
one glycoprotein, as well as many glycans at the same
glycosite, which makes the glycosylation much more
complex. Intact glycopeptides simultaneously contain
the sequence of peptides, glycosites as well as glycan
structures corresponding to the sites. And there have
been several reports about the determination of sitespecific glycoforms by MS, including N- and O-linked
glycosylation [26–28]. In our previous work, site-specific
glycoforms of total cell proteins were determined by
combining de-glycopeptide and intact glycopeptide
analysis [29]. Up to now, however, the identification
and quantification of intact glycopeptides on large-scale
remains a huge challenge, especially for the analysis of
glycosylation of low abundance secreted glycoproteins.
Herein, we fabricated a platform for characterizing
the glycosylation heterogeneity of secreted proteins
in our MDR models, which included concentration of
secreted proteins, enrichment of intact glycopeptides and
determination of site-specific glycoforms. Additionally,
the glycosites and site-specific glycoforms of secreted
proteins were quantified, which comprised glycosite
occupancy in protein as well as different glycan structures
on the same glycosite. Totally, 1033 glycosites were
identified from secreted proteins of SGC7901, SGC7901/
ADR and SGC7901/VCR, including 240 sites with
different glycosylation occupancy. A total of 2222 sitespecific glycoforms were determined, and 499 site-specific
glycoforms on 151 sites were significantly different
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

between SGC7901 and its MDR sublines. To the best of
our knowledge, this is the first large-scale analysis of sitespecific glycoforms of secreted proteins in gastric cancer.
Consequently, the comprehensive characterization of sitespecific glycosylation could help us better understand the
sophisticated mechanism of MDR in gastric cancer, thus
promoting the discovery of feasible biomarkers for MDR
and improving the efficiency of chemotherapy.

RESULTS
Generation of secretome datasets from 3 gastric
cancer cell lines
As stated above, the secretome of tumor cells
played important roles in the process of acquired
chemoresistance. Consequently, the analysis of secreted
glycoproteins on proteome level could help us understand
the specific mechanism of drug resistance. Due to the very
low abundance, the analysis of secreted glycoproteins
is still a big challenge, especially for gastric cancer
cells and tissues. Thus, the secreted proteins need to
be concentrated before analysis. As shown in Figure 1,
the serum-free culture medium was collected and then
concentrated by ultra filters (UF). The secreted proteins
with low abundance could be effectively concentrated,
and the salts in medium could be removed at the same
time. Additionally, the glycopeptides were enriched by
using hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography
(HILIC), which could retain the glycan structures linked
to glycosites with high specificity. For the determination
of site-specific glycoforms, the information of backbone
peptide sequence, glycosite location and glycan structures
was obtained by analysis of de-glycopeptides and intact
glycopeptides, respectively.
Generally speaking, a total of 1033 N-linked
glycosites (localization probability > 0.75), mapping
to 436 non-redundant N-glycoproteins (shown in
Supplementary Table S1), were quantified from secreted
proteins of the three cell lines (SGC7901, SGC7901/ADR
and SGC7901/VCR), among which 613 N-glycosites and
286 N-glycoproteins were quantified in all the three cell
lines. In addition, we totally identified 2222 N-linked sitespecific glycoforms with high confidence. The detailed
information of N-linked glycosites, N-glycoproteins and
site-specific glycoforms identified from each cell line is
summarized in Figure 2.
To verify whether the identified glycoproteins were
secretory proteins, we applied bioinformatics softwares
and Uniprot database to predict protein secretion pathway.
272 proteins were predicted to be secreted in the classical
secretory pathway (138 proteins predicted by SignalP
program and 134 proteins including the Uniprot keyword
“secreted and/or signal”). In addition, the SecretomeP
software presented that 74 proteins were secreted through
the nonclassical secretory pathway. In short, these results

manifested that 79% of the identified glycoproteins could
be released into the conditioned medium by different
secretory pathways, demonstrating high efficiency of the
platform for analysis of secreted protein glycosylation
(Supplementary Figure S1).
To further characterize the identified secreted
glycoproteins, protein ontology analysis was executed by
Panther software to interpret the functions and involved
pathways of the 346 secreted glycoproteins. As shown
in Supplementary Figure S2, these glycoproteins had
multiple functions and participated in diverse pathways
that might play vital roles in the development of MDR.
The top three most common molecular functions were
catalytic activity (32.8%), binding (27.0%) and receptor
activity (25.0%). Besides, the major involved pathways
related to MDR were integrin signaling pathway,
TGF-β signaling pathway, cadherin signaling pathway,
angiogenesis, Wnt signaling pathway and apoptosis
signaling pathway.

Then we, for the first time, attempted to illuminate
the possible correlations of site-specific glycosylation
of glycoproteins with MDR through comprehensively
analyzing the changes of glycosites and site-specific
glycoforms of secreted proteins during MDR in gastric
cancer.

Characterization of
varying with MDR

N-glycosite

occupancy

Because of significant changes in glycosite
occupancy during MDR, the quantification of glycosites
was important for studying MDR. We compared the
N-glycosites of SGC7901 cell line with those of two
drug-resistant cell lines, respectively. About 81 glycosites
were only quantified in both of the MDR cell lines, while
75 glycosites were only identified in secreted proteins
of SGC7901 (Figure 2A, Supplementary Table S1).
Additionally, among the 613 glycosites identified in all the

three lines, 84 glycosites in secreted glycoproteins were
significantly changed between SGC7901 and the MDR
cell lines with p-value ≤ 0.01 by t-test (Figure 3). Totally,
240 N-glycosites were found dramatically changed in
SGC7901-ADR/VCR (124 increased and 116 decreased)
compared to SGC7901, as illustrated in Supplementary
Table S1. And the significantly different glycosites could
be mapped to 163 glycoproteins (84 glycoproteins for upregulated glycosites, 76 glycoproteins for down-regulated
glycosites). Interestingly, there are 3 proteins (IGF2R,
ITGB1 and PTPRF) that both have up-regulated and
down-regulated glycosites, among which 2 glycoproteins
(IGF2R, ITGB1) have been demonstrated to be involved
in drug-resistance. Interestingly, as a major player in
chemoresistance, ITGB1 (integrin beta-1) could mediate
the anti-apoptosis effects of TIMP1 (further discussed
below) in melanoma [30].
Further bioinformatics analysis indicated that the
leading three molecular functions of 87 glycoproteins
for increased glycosites were binding (32.4%), receptor
activity (25.4%) and catalytic activity (23.9%), while for
79 glycoproteins corresponding to decreased glycosites,
catalytic activity (33.3%), receptor activity (25.0%)
and binding (25.0%) ranked the top three. And these
three molecular functions were closely related to drug
resistance. Moreover, in terms of specific pathways,
the numbers of annotated glycoproteins in category of
increased glycosites outperformed those in category of
decreased glycosites. For example, 12 glycoproteins in
Integrin signaling pathway and 4 glycoproteins in TGFbeta signaling pathway were annotated in the cluster of
glycoproteins with increased glycosites, much more
than those annotated in the cluster of glycoproteins
for decreased glycosites. The detailed information
was provided in Figure 4. It seemingly highlighted the
importance of increased glycosites and their corresponding
glycoproteins in the rise of MDR.

various cancers, and multiple N-glycomic alterations were
prominently associated with drug resistance [22, 31]. Ma
et al. [31] reported that increased core-fucosylated and
sialylated glycans were, to some extent, responsible for
MDR in breast cancer cells. However, it was not the same
case in MDR of gastric cancer. In the present study, we
merely found increased core-fucosylation and hybrid
glycans after acquired drug resistance in gastric cancer
cell lines, while the other major glycoforms did not
show distinct changes. More interestingly, the two MDR
sublines exhibited diverse glycomic changes compared
to their parental cell line in most cases (Supplementary
Table S2). This might be caused by the heterogeneity
of glycan structures onto the glycosites. Nevertheless,
we maintained that this result could not fully represent
the comprehensive glycomic alterations during MDR,
as glycosylation contained the information of peptide
backbone sequences, glycosite location and glycan
structures, simultaneously. Thus, the determination of sitespecific glycoforms in secreted proteins could completely
reveal the heterogeneity of glycosylation. As shown in
Figure 2C, about 31% (678/2222) of the glycoforms were
identified in at least two cell lines and the overlap of sitespecific glycoforms of three gastric cancer cell lines was
merely 12% (272/2222) of the total identified glycoforms,
which demonstrated that site-specific glycoforms
did dramatically change between drug sensitive and
resistant cancer cells. The detailed information of sitespecific glycoforms of each cell line was displayed in
Supplementary Table S2.
Moreover, we further characterized the significantly
different site-specific glycoforms between SGC7901
and its MDR counterparts. As shown in Supplementary
Table S2, 175 site-specific glycoforms were increased in
secreted proteins of MDR cell lines, while 324 glycoforms
were decreased. Interestingly, we discovered that some
glycosites contained both up-regulated and downregulated glycoforms, indicating the high complexity of
glycosylation. Totally, 499 site-specific glycoforms onto
151 glycosites in 106 glycoproteins were significantly
changed between SGC7901 and its MDR derivates. Further
analysis of the mapped glycoproteins showed that most of
the annotated glycoproteins were involved in pathways

profiles changed remarkably after chemotherapy in

to play critical roles in drug resistance of cancer.

that the glycosites with significant changes on glycositelevel rarely intersected with those corresponding to altered
site-specific glycoforms (Supplementary Table S3).
Moreover, we analyzed the glycosites with significantly
altered site-specific glycoforms, and found that about
54% of the glycosites contained more than two significant
glycoforms (shown in Supplementary Figure S4), which
indicated the high heterogeneity of glycosylation during
MDR process. And a total number of 57 glycoproteins

Integrative characterization of changed sites and
altered site-specific glycoforms
As described above, both of the glycosites and sitespecific glycoforms were greatly different between drugsensitive and drug-resistant cell lines. Notably, we found

one specific glycosite were identified (Supplementary
Table S4). 33 of the glycoproteins had been reported to be
associated with MDR of multiple cancers by searching in
PubMed (Table 1). Thus, the quantification of glycosites
combined with determination of glycoforms could
preferably demonstrate the relationship between changes
of glycosylation and MDR. The identified glycoproteins
with significant changes on site-level and glycoformlevel would be the key points of our further research on
chemoresistance in gastric cancer.

MDR were massively studied. Yet, there are few reports
about the relationship between glycosylation of secretory
proteins and MDR.
Here, we would comprehensively discuss the
changes of glycosylation of four candidate glycoproteins
during MDR by integrative analysis of glycosites and sitespecific glycoforms. The receptor tyrosine kinase AXL is
over-expressed in different types of cancers and implicated
in several malignant phenotypes of tumor cells, such as
invasion and chemoresistance [35, 36]. AXL could mediate
multi-drug resistance by modulation of microRNAs and
EMT (epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition), as well as
signaling pathways of PI3K/Akt and EGFR/PKC/mTOR
[37–41]. More importantly, aberrant glycosylation of AXL
was reported to contribute to tumor proliferation, invasion
and metastasis [42], and alpha-2, 6-sialyltransferases
ST6GalNAcII was further identified as critical modulator
of its functions in mammary phyllodes tumors [43]. In
this work, we characterized the changes of site-specific
glycosylation in secretory AXL during the acquisition
of MDR in stomach cancer for the first time. Generally
speaking, we identified three N-glycosites – Asn198,
Asn339 and Asn345, among which Asn198 was found
significantly reduced in MDR cells. Intriguingly, seven
significantly differentially expressed glycoforms were
quantified at Asn198 and the other two glycosites were
identified without distinctly altered N-glycans (Figure  5A,
Supplementary Table S5), which possibly implied the
importance of Asn198 in the actions of AXL. Soluble
AXL may result from the proteolytic cleavage of receptor
tyrosine kinase AXL [44]. It was reported that soluble
AXL could outperform AFP in diagnosing very early
hepatocellular carcinoma [45] and correlated with tumor
stage as well as patient survival in renal cell carcinoma
[46]. While, our further work validated the increased
mRNA expression of AXL in GC MDR cells and increased
protein expression of soluble AXL in the conditioned
medium of GC MDR cells. In addition, we found that high
expression of tumor AXL predicted worse survival in GC
patients based on TCGA database (Figure 6). In a word,
glycosylation and expression differences of soluble AXL
between GC drug-sensitive and resistant cells have been
observed, suggesting a significant role of soluble AXL
in the MDR of GC, but this hypothesis requires further
researches to explore how soluble AXL and aberrantly
glycosylated AXL influence the MDR of GC.
We also characterized the site-specific glycosylation
changes of three other proteins—L1CAM, TIMP1
and CLU, during MDR of GC cells (Figure 5B–5D,
Supplementary Tables S6–S8). These proteins are all
heavily glycosylated proteins and known to be involved
in resistance to chemotherapies in multiple cancer types
[47–52] [16, 53, 54]. Moreover, as glycoproteins,
the functions of TIMP1 and CLU were reported to
be markedly influenced by altered glycans [55–57].
Nevertheless, previous studies rarely focused on the

DISCUSSION
In the current study, we provided the most
comprehensive secretome glycoproteomic characterization
of SGC7901 and its MDR counterparts SGC7901/ADR,
SGC7901/VCR. These three gastric cancer cell lines are
extensively and intensively studied in our lab to elucidate
the underlying mechanism of MDR in GC using genomic
and proteomic approaches [32, 33]. However, these studies
mainly focused on the protein expression, but provided
little information about protein glycosylation.
Herein, for the first time, we explored the
correlations between glycosylation, particularly sitespecific glycosylation, in secreted glycoproteins and
multidrug resistance in gastric cancer. Totally, 1033
N-glycosites in 436 glycoproteins and 2222 N-linked sitespecific glycoforms were identified and quantified from
secreted proteins of SGC7901 and its MDR counterparts.
It was noteworthy that core-fucosylation was increased
in MDR cells. And, others had reported similar results
in breast cancer cells [31] and prostate cancer cells [28].
Moreover, overexpression of two fucosyltransferases
(FUT8 and FUT11) was probably responsible for the
change of fucosylation observed in MDR cells [28].
Cheng et al. demonstrated that the alterations of FUTs
(FUT4, FUT6 and FUT8) were involved in MDR in
human hepatocellular carcinoma cells by modulating
PI3K/Akt signaling pathway and MRP1 expression [34].
In our study, the increased fucosylation may be due to the
up-regulation of FUT8 and FUT11 based on our mRNA
sequencing results (data not shown). But, this hypothesis
needs to be validated by further studies.
Besides, our preliminary results manifested that
glycosites and site-specific glycoforms of secreted
glycoproteins in MDR cells vastly differed from those
in the parental ones. Compared to SGC7901, about
499 site-specific glycoforms in 106 glycoproteins were
significantly changed with the similar trend in the two
MDR cell lines. We further identified 57 glycoproteins
with more than 2 significantly different site-specific
glycoforms at one specific glycosite between drugsensitive and resistant cell lines, and found that more
than half of them had been demonstrated to be involved
in chemoresistance of various cancer types, among which
the key roles of AXL, L1CAM, TIMP1 and Clusterin in

alterations of protein glycosylation during multi-drug
resistance in cancer. In our study, we identified and
quantified the differences of glycosites and site-specific
glycoforms of L1CAM, TIMP1 and CLU between
SGC7901 and its MDR derivates, and found significant
changes on glycosites as well as site-specific glycans. This
suggested that glycosylation at specific glycosites might
possibly have an enormous impact on actions of the three
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

proteins in MDR of gastric cancer. Further researches are
needed to confirm this plausible conclusion.
In conclusion, our present work could well
characterize the site-specific glycosylation of secreted
glycoproteins, including the glycosite occupancy as well
as glycan structures. And, we believe that glycosylation at
specific positions and its changes in secreted glycoproteins
would be greatly involved in the acquisition of MDR, and
25321

our work could provide new insights into the sophisticated
mechanisms underlying MDR in gastric cancer. Furthermore,
the aberrantly glycosylated secreted glycoproteins obtained

in our work would be candidate biomarkers for MDR
prediction or key targets to reverse drug resistance in gastric
cancer. Further investigations are warranted to verify this.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The glycopeptide enrichment was performed with
click maltose-HILIC materials. The prepared materials
(10 mg) were washed by 80% ACN/ 1% TFA, and the
digestions of secreted proteins (160 μg) were mixed with
HILIC materials. After incubated at room temperature for
90 min, the supernatant was removed by centrifugation at
20, 000 g for 3 min, and the HILIC materials were further
washed with 200 μL 80% ACN/1% TFA for three times.
Finally, the glycopeptides were eluted by using 100 μL
30% ACN/1% FA solution for twice, and the eluted
fractions were combined. The enriched glycopeptides were
divided into two portions, and one part of glycopeptides
was deglycosylated by using PNGase F (500 units) in
10 mM NH4HCO3 (pH 8.0) at 37°C overnight. Then, the
enriched glycopeptides and de-glycopeptides from about
50 μg tryptic digestions of proteins were dried for MS
analysis, respectively.

Reagents and materials
Trypsin, 1, 4-dithiothreitol (DTT), iodacetamide (IAA),
trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) and formic acid (FA) were obtained
from Sigma (St. Louis, MO, USA). PNGase F was purchased
from New England Biolabs (Ipswich, MA, USA). The
centrifugal filter units (Amicon Ultra, 3 KD, 15 mL) were
purchased from Millipore (Milford, MA, USA). Acetonitrile
(ACN, HPLC grade) was from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany).
Water used in all experiments was purified with a Milli-Q
system (Millipore, Milford, MA, USA). C18 AQ beads
(3 μm, 120 Å) were from Michrom BioResources (Auburn,
CA, USA). The click maltose-HILIC beads were obtained
from Xinmiao Liang group (liangxm@dicp.ac.cn).

Cell culture and secretome collection

Mass spectrometric analysis

Human gastric adenocarcinoma cell line SGC7901
was obtained from the Academy of Military Medical
Science (Beijing, China). And the MDR sublines,
SGC7901/VCR (VCR) and SGC7901/ADR (ADR),
were developed by stepwise selection with vincristine
and adriamycin, respectively. The above three cell lines
were maintained in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented
with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 U/ml penicillin
sodium and 100 mg/ml streptomycin sulphate at 37°C in
a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Vincristine
(1 μg/ml) or adriamycin (0.5 μg/ml) was added to the
culture medium of corresponding MDR cell sublines to
maintain their MDR phenotype. The gastric cancer cell
lines were appropriately cultured until ~70% confluence
(150 mm cell culture dish). In order to eliminate the
possible interference of residual FBS, the cancer cells
were washed with PBS (phosphate buffered saline) and
serum-free RPMI-1640 medium, respectively. Then, cells
were maintained in 30 ml serum-free RPMI-1640 medium
at 37°C for another 24 h. The conditioned medium was
collected and centrifuged at 1000 g to remove cell debris.
Then the secreted proteins samples were concentrated
using 3 KD MWCO Ultra Centrifugal Filters. The secreted
protein concentration was determined by BCA assay.

The LC-MS/MS analyses were performed on a
Q-Exactive mass spectrometer (Thermo, San Jose, CA)
equipped with an Ultimate 3000 system (Thermo, San Jose,
CA) for separation. The LC-MS/MS system contained a
C18 capillary trap column (200 μm i.d., C18 AQ beads
(5 μm, 120 Å)) and a 12-cm C18 capillary analysis
column (75 μm i.d., C18 AQ beads (3 μm, 120 Å)).
Mobile phases A (98% H2O/2% acetonitrile/0.1% FA)
and B (80% acetonitrile/20% H2O/0.1% FA) were
used to develop a gradient. For both glycopeptides and
de-glycopeptides, the RP gradient was developed at
300 nl/ min as follows: loading sample for 15 min, from
4 to 45% buffer B for 135 min, from 45 to 90% buffer B
for 15 min, from 90 to 90% buffer B for 10 min, from 90
to 4% buffer B for 4 min and from 4 to 4% buffer B for
11 min. The temperature of the ion transfer capillary was
220°C and the normalized collision energy was set to 25%.
The mass resolution was set to 70, 000 for full MS and 17,
500 for HCD MS/MS. Survey full scan MS was acquired
from m/z 400 to 2, 000, and 15 most intense ions were
selected for MS/MS scan. The dynamic exclusion was
set as follows: repeat count, 1; duration, 30 s; exclusion
list size, 500; exclusion duration, 90 s. All the samples,
including intact glycopeptides and de-glycopeptides were
analyzed for three runs.

Protein digestion and glycopeptide enrichment
The protein samples were prepared following the
previously reported with some modifications. Briefly, 0.8
mg secreted proteins were reduced by DTT at 37°C for
2 h and alkylated by IAA in dark at room temperature
for 30 min. Then, trypsin was added with ratio at 1:50
(trypsin/ proteins, w/w), and the mix was incubated at
37°C overnight. The trypsin was again added at the same
weight ratio, and incubated at 37°C for another 4 h. The
tryptic digests were desalted by SPE column (Waters,
USA) and dried for further analysis.

Mass spectrometry data analysis
For glycosite analysis of secreted proteins, the
mass spectrometric data of de-glycopeptides acquired
by Q-Exactive MS was searched and quantified by using
Maxquant (1.5.2.8) [58]. The following parameters were
used for searching: mass tolerances were 20 ppm and
0.1 Da for the precursor and fragments, respectively; for
trypsin digested samples, enzyme specificity was set to
KR/P with up to 2 missed sites; cysteine residue was set

TCGA data analysis

as a static modification of 57.0215 Da; Asn deamidation
(+0.9840 Da) and methionine oxidation (+15.9949 Da)
were set as variable modifications. The glycosites were
identified with the motif of N-X (Not Proline)-S/T. For
the quantification of glycosites, label free quantification
(LFQ) in Maxquant was employed to extract the intensity
of full MS, and quantification data was further analyzed
by Perseus software (version 1.5.1.6) with Log2 transform
and Z-score normalization. The determination of sitespecific glycoforms was performed by using ArMone
proteomics data processing platform (http://www.
bioanalysis.dicp.ac.cn/proteomics/software/ArMone2.
html) with some modifications [59]. First, the peptide
sequence was identified using Mascot (2.3.0) following
the above parameters with FDR for peptide identification
of both peptides and proteins < 1%. And information
of N-glycosites and peptide sequences was integrated
into a format file “Peptide list” (.ppl), while the mass
spectrometric data of intact glycopeptide acquired by
Q-Exactive MS was converted into format of ‘MZ.xml’
using MS Convert. Then the ‘.ppl’ (deglycopeptides)
and ‘MZ.xml’ (intact glycopeptides) were loaded into
Armone proteomics data processing platform. The
software could automatically extract MS/MS spectra of
intact glycopeptides based on oxonium ions, and the Y1
ions (peptide sequence +GlcNAc) could be determined
by the characters of N-linked five core glycans. Then
the molecular weight of both peptide backbone and
glycans could be calculated. And the peptide back bone
sequences were determined by matching the MW of Y1
ions to that from de-glycopeptides identified from Mascot
search. The backbone sequences were filtered based on
the maximum of 15 min in retention time and 20 ppm
for MW. The glycan structures were determined by using
MW and fragments of specific sugars. The site-specific
glycoforms could be determined by combining the two
part information, and the results were further filtered
with glycopeptide score more than 10, and most of the
glycan structures were further manually corrected. For the
quantification of site-specific glycoforms, the intensity
of glycoforms was extracted by house software, and the
intensity was transformed to Log2 and normalized with
Z-score by using Perseus software (version 1.5.1.6).
Additionally, for glycoforms quantified in the secreted
proteins of three cell lines, those meeting the criteria
(Ratio MDR/7901 > 2 OR < 0.5) were identified as
significantly changed glycoforms. While, the glycoforms
determined only in MDR cell lines (ADR&VCR, spectra
count > 2) or only in SGC7901 cell line (spectra count
> 5) were also judged as significantly changed glycoforms.
Furthermore, the secretome was defined to proteins
with the Uniprot keyword “signal or secreted” and those
predicted by SignalP 4.1 [60] or SecretomeP 2.0 [61].
In addition, functional classification of the identified
glycoproteins was performed by PANTHER classification
system [62].

The clinical and gene expression data of 295 primary
gastric adenocarcinomas were derived from TCGA data
portal (https://tcga-data.nci.nih.gov/tcga/) and TCGAbased publication [63]. The expression of AXL was divided
into high and low expression group by median expression.
Then, the association between AXL expression and patient
survival was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method
with the log-rank test in Cox proportional hazards model.

Western blot
The concentrated secreted protein samples
collected above were resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE
(Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA) and blotted
onto nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences,
Pittsburgh, PA, USA). Membrane was blocked with 10%
non-fat milk at room temperature for 2 h and incubated
overnight with primary antibody: anti-AXL (1:1000;
Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA). After three 5 min washes
in TBST (Triethanolamine-Buffered Saline Solution
with 0.1% Tween-20), membrane was incubated with
horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugated secondary
antibody (1:2000; Santa cruz Biotechnology, Dallas,
TX, USA) for 2 h at room temperature and then washed
again in TBST and visualized with an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (ECL-kit, santa cruz biotechnology,
Dallas, TX, USA). All experiments were performed in
triplicate.
