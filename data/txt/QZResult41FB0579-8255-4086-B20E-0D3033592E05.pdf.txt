Abstract
Patients with HPV-positive head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC)
show better survival rates than those with HPV-negative HNSCC. While an enhanced
radiosensitivity of HPV-positive tumors is clearly evident from single modality
treatment, cisplatin is never administered as monotherapy and therefore its
contribution to the enhanced cure rates of HPV-positive HNSCC is not known. Both
cisplatin and radiotherapy can cause severe irreversible side effects and therefore
various clinical studies are currently testing deintensified regimes for patients with
HPV-positive HNSCC. One strategy is to omit cisplatin-based chemotherapy or replace
it by less toxic treatments but the risk assessment of these approaches remains
difficult. In this study we have compared the cytotoxic effects of cisplatin in a panel of
HPV-positive and -negative HNSCC cell lines alone and when combined with radiation.
While cisplatin-treated HPV-positive strains showed a slightly stronger inhibition
of proliferation, there was no difference regarding colony formation. Cellular responses
to the drug, namely cell cycle distribution, apoptosis and γH2AX-induction did not
differ between the two entities but assessment of cisplatin-DNA-adducts suggests
differences regarding the mechanisms that determine cisplatin sensitivity. Combining
cisplatin with radiation, we generally observed an additive but only in a minority of
strains from both entities a clear synergistic effect on colony formation. In summary,
HPV-positive and -negative HNSCC cells were equally sensitive to cisplatin. Therefore
replacing cisplatin may be feasible but the substituting agent should be of similar
efficacy in order not to jeopardize the high cure rates for HPV-positive HNSCC.

Introduction

in the oropharynx and, in contrast to non-HPV-driven
HNSCC, they show high expression of the CDK4/6inhibitor p16. The incidence of such HPV/p16-positive
(HPV(+)) HNSCC is increasing in many countries
[3]. The standard treatment of advanced HNSCC
regardless of HPV-status is highly intense cisplatinbased radiochemotherapy (RCT), either in the primary
setting or as adjuvant therapy after radical surgery.
Patients with HPV(+) HNSCC show remarkably better

With an annual incidence of approximately 600.000
new cases worldwide head and neck squamous cell
carcinoma (HNSCC) represents the 6th most common
cancer type [1, 2]. Major risk factors are the heavy
consumption of tobacco and alcohol or infections with
human papillomavirus (HPV). HPV-related tumors are
preferentially located at the lingual and palatine tonsils

survival rates [4] and various studies are currently testing
deintensified therapeutic regimes in order to reduce severe
and irreversible side effects for cancer survivors [5, 6].
Deintensification can be achieved by various approaches,
such as the reduction of radiation dose or by omitting
or exchanging cisplatin-based chemotherapy. Such a
replacement of cisplatin by the anti-EGFR-antibody
cetuximab is currently being tested in three similar phase
3 trials (De-ESCALaTE, RTOG1016, TROG12.01).
With regard to the mechanisms underlying the
favorable prognosis conferred by HPV-positivity, an
enhanced tumor radiosensitivity is clearly evident from
single modality radiotherapy (RT) treatment [7, 8]. This
enhanced sensitivity was also demonstrated on the cellular
level when comparing HPV(+) and HPV(-) HNSCC cell
lines [9-12]. Since cisplatin is never administered in
monotherapy and since only few preclinical data exist for
HPV(+) HNSCC [13], it remains unclear whether HPV(+)
tumors are also characterized by an enhanced cisplatinsensitivity. In case of an extraordinary sensitivity and
considerable contribution of cisplatin to the high cure
rates under standard RCT, omitting or replacing cisplatin
may pose the risk of poorer therapeutic efficacy and
reduced long-term survival. In this project we therefore
compared the cellular responses to cisplatin as well as
the cytotoxicity conferred by cisplatin alone and when
combined with radiation in a panel of six HPV(+) and five
HPV(-) HNSCC cell lines.

Cell proliferation
In order to evaluate the sensitivity of HPV(+)
and HPV(-) HNSCC cells towards cisplatin, we treated
HNSCC cell lines with increasing doses of the drug
for 5 days and assessed the resulting number of cells.
We observed a relatively high variation between the
individual strains ranging from 100% to only 23% growth
inhibition at a concentration of 0.3µM cisplatin (Figure
1A). At all concentrations the group of HPV(+) HNSCC
strains demonstrate a trend towards more pronounced
proliferation inhibition and toxicity (Figure 1B) but
statistical significance was not reached (p = 0.165).

Cellular responses and DNA-adducts
To assess whether there are principal differences
in the cellular responses of HPV(+) and HPV(-) HNSCC
cells to cisplatin, cells were treated with a concentration of
1µM (0.3µg/ml). This concentration is in the lower range
of the total cisplatin plasma concentrations observed after
the initial fast decline a few hours after infusion [14] and
therefore represents a physiologically relevant dose. We
assessed the cell cycle response, the induction of apoptosis,

of cisplatin and incubated for 5 days. Cell numbers were assessed, the numbers of cells seeded was subtracted and the resulting numbers

the DNA damage marker γH2AX and the formation
and maintenance of cisplatin-DNA-adducts in pairs of
HPV(+) and HPV(-) cell lines with similar sensitivity.
To this end we chose HSC4 and UM-SCC-47, which still
demonstrated proliferation at 1µM cisplatin, as resistant
cell lines, FaDu and UD-SCC-2, which demonstrated a
steady state in cell number, as intermediately sensitive
strains and SAT and UPCI-SCC-154, which showed a
decrease in cell number, as sensitive strains (see Figure
1A).

sensitive strains, but at later time points the portion of cells
in the G2-phase declined. Notably, we did not observe any
principal differences between HPV(+) and HPV(-) cell
lines.
Apoptosis
The induction of apoptosis upon cisplatin exposure
is believed to be an important mediator of cell death and
inactivation [15]. To determine to what extent the cell line
specific accumulation of cells in the S- and G2-phases was
accompanied by the induction of apoptosis, we assessed
caspase activation upon treatment with 1µM cisplatin.
In the resistant cell lines we observed an early peak of
cells showing caspase activation that was followed by a
fast decline to baseline levels (Figure 2B). In contrast,
sensitive cells showed a steady increase in the portion
of apoptotic cells that was also observed in cells of
intermediate sensitivity but to a lesser extent. In absolute
numbers however, the percentages of cells demonstrating
caspase activation upon cisplatin treatment remained
below 10%, except for the UD-SCC-2 strain, which
contained a profound number of cells with caspase activity
already without treatment (Suppl. Figure 1). In conclusion,
these low numbers call into question whether apoptosis
plays a major role in the sensitivity towards cisplatin under
our experimental conditions.

Cell cycle
As cisplatin-DNA-adducts are obstacles for
DNA replication fork progression, cells accumulate in
the S-phase of the cell cycle upon cisplatin exposure.
Depending on the dose and on the ability to repair and
bypass the acquired lesions, cells slowly progress through
the S- and then an often prolonged G2-phase towards
mitosis. In line with the sensitivity as observed in the
proliferation assay, we observed an initial accumulation
of cells in the S-phase which in both sensitive cell lines
was followed by a constant increase of cells arrested in
G2 (Figure 2A). In contrast, the resistant strains HSC4
and UM-SCC-47 showed less accumulation in the
S-phase followed by a complete recovery of the cell cycle
distribution. Intermediately sensitive cells showed an
initial accumulation in the S- and G2-phase, similar to the

Figure 4: Cisplatin-DNA-adduct levels. Cells were incubated with 1µM cisplatin. After the times indicated the cells were harvested

and subjected to genomic DNA isolation. Pt(GpG) adduct levels were determined using Southwestern blots and staining with an antiPt(GpG)-antibody. Methylenblue staining of whole genomic DNA was performed as a loading control. Statistically significant differences
between groups are indicated by asterisks (HSC4 vs. FaDu: p = 0.0232 and HSC4 vs. SAT: p = 0.300). In both evaluations significance
was reached at 24h (**** and ***) and for HSC4 vs. SAT also at 48h and 72h (* and *) (RM two-way ANOVA with post-hoc analyses
(Holm-Sidak)).

γH2AX

which declined thereafter but especially in the highly
sensitive SAT cells remained at a fairly high level until
the end of the time course (Figure 4). The HPV(+) strains
UD-SCC-2 and UPCI-SCC-154 cells, however, showed
DNA-adduct levels comparable to the resistant strains. In
fact, the most sensitive strain, UPCI-SCC-154, showed the
lowest adduct level of all cell lines.
So, while none of the assays reflecting the cellular
responses towards cisplatin (cell cycle distribution,
apoptosis and γH2AX formation) demonstrated a general
difference between HPV(+) and HPV(-) cell lines, the
cisplatin-DNA-adduct assessment suggests that cisplatin
sensitivity may be governed by different mechanisms with
cisplatin-adduct excision from DNA possibly being a more
critical step in HPV(-) HNSCC.

γH2AX is the phosphorylated form of histone 2AX.
H2AX is phosphorylated upon various forms of DNAdamage and γH2AX is a marker of DNA double-strand
breaks and stalled replication. In contrast to the distinct
foci observed in immunofluorescence analyses upon
ionizing irradiation [11, 16], cisplatin exposure more
often led to a pan-nuclear staining especially of S-phase
cells likely due to the stalling of multiple replication forks
(not shown). Therefore, we performed flow cytometric
analyses to quantify cellular γH2AX levels (Figure 3A).
We again observed marked differences between resistant
and sensitive cells. While we observed an initial induction
of H2AX-phosphorylation in the S&G2 phase in all cell
lines, γH2AX declined over time in resistant cells (Figure
3B). In contrast, the γH2AX levels remained high in
both sensitive strains. The two cell lines of intermediate
sensitivity showed a divergent response with that of FaDu
resembling the phenotype of the resistant cells and that
of UD-SCC-2 resembling the phenotype of the sensitive
cells.

Colony formation
In addition to the effects observed on proliferation,
we also assessed the ability of all HPV(+) and HPV(-)
cell lines to form colonies upon cisplatin treatment as a
more robust readout for cytotoxicity. Here, we observed
an even more pronounced variation among the different
strains (Figure 5A). While those cell lines characterized
as most resistant or highly sensitive in the proliferation
assay showed a similar phenotype in the colony formation
assay, some variations were observed for other strains
and, importantly, the trend towards a higher sensitivity of
HPV(+) strains was lost (Figure 5B).
In these colony formation assays we used an
experimental setup with a long incubation period of 1
week, to compare the long-term effects of relatively low
doses of cisplatin instead of using short term pulses with
high concentrations that are unlikely to be reached in

Cisplatin-DNA-adducts
Cisplatin exerts its cytotoxic effects largely via
the induction of cisplatin-DNA inter- and intrastrand
crosslinks. The latter are far more frequent and can be
detected by adduct-specific antibodies [17]. We assessed
the level of cisplatin-guanin-guanin intrastrand crosslinks
(Pt(GpG)) at different time points after treatment with
1µM cisplatin using a Southwestern slot blot. In contrast
to the cellular responses described above, the outcome was
only partly associated with the sensitivity of the cell lines.
Both resistant strains showed only weak adduct formation
while the HPV(-) strains FaDu and SAT demonstrated
a high initial adduct level at 24h after cisplatin addition

patients` tumor tissue. Testing a more common but still
relatively long incubation time of 24h in four selected
strains, we observed a similar sequence of sensitivities
(Suppl. Figure 2). However, when considering the
profound decrease in incubation time, the cytotoxicity
conferred by 24h of cisplatin treatment was found to be
surprisingly similar to the results obtained after 1 week
of treatment. Furthermore, the rapid recovery of the
resistant HSC4 and UM-SCC-47 cells from cell cycle
arrest, apoptosis-induction and γH2AX formation, which
was observed in the presence of cisplatin (Figures 2, 3, 4),
prompted us to investigate the biological activity of the
compound after incubation under cell culture conditions.
Surprisingly, after three days of preincubation, cisplatin
completely failed to inhibit colony formation (Figure

5C). Addition of FBS was not necessary for inactivation
whereas storage at -20°C largely preserved cytotoxicity.
This loss of biological activity likely explains the recovery
from the various cellular stress responses observed in the
resistant HSC4 and UM-SCC-47 cells.

Interaction with radiation
In the curative treatment of HNSCC cisplatin is
combined with radiotherapy and in the field of radiation
oncology it is often referred to as a potent radiosensitizer,
meaning that beyond its single agent cytotoxicity it also
enhances the effects of radiation. Therefore we also
assessed the effect of combined treatment in the colony

of each individual strain) was added after 3 hours. 72 h after cisplatin addition the cells were irradiated with the doses indicated. After
a total of 1 week of cisplatin incubation the medium was exchanged and the cells were incubated until formation of colonies. B. Higher
cisplatin dose and earlier irradiation: Cells were treated as in (A) except for the addition of a higher concentration of cisplatin (IC75 of each

sample to show only synergistic effects. In case of statistically significant differences the p-value is given in brackets and individual

formation assay. Clinically, radiotherapy is administered
in daily fractions while cisplatin can be administered in
multiple ways varying typically from three times 100mg/
m2 administered every three weeks to 30mg/m2 weekly.
In any case most fractions of radiotherapy are not given
at the time of cisplatin administration. We therefore chose
to irradiate three days after cisplatin supplementation, a
time point at which cisplatin is no longer active in the
medium (Figure 5C) but various cellular responses are still
observable in most cell lines (Figures 2, 3, 4). To account
for the different sensitivities of the individual strains, we
administered the individual inactivating concentration
50% (IC50) as assessed in the colony formation assay
(Figure 5A, Suppl. Figure 3). Colony formation of all cell
lines was reduced upon cisplatin treatment (Suppl. Figure
4). To assess the interaction of cisplatin and irradiation the
cytotoxic effect of cisplatin was subtracted by normalizing
the data to the respective non-irradiated samples. We
observed a statistically significant reduction in cell
survival in four cell lines, namely UD-SCC-2, UPCISCC-90, UPCI-SCC-154 cells (HPV+) and FaDu (HPV-)
(Figure 6A). Using a higher cisplatin concentration (IC75,
Suppl. Figure 3) and an earlier irradiation time point of
6h after cisplatin administration in some cell lines, we
obtained partly the same and partly divergent results,
demonstrating some variability and dependence on the
experimental setup (Figure 6B). In summary, these data
argue against a robust effect of cisplatin in enhancing the
efficiency of ionizing radiation in either of the two entities.

In contrast we had previously observed a clearly distinct
cell cycle response after ionizing irradiation also in cell
lines of similar radiosensitivity [11]. In a study using
19 HNSCC cell lines Martens-de Kemp et al. found the
cisplatin-DNA-adduct level to be the only predictor of
cisplatin sensitivity while the expression level of influx
and efflux transporters or DNA repair proteins showed
no association [18]. In that study the adduct level was
only determined in HPV-negative cell lines. In our study,
despite differences in cisplatin concentration and timing,
the observed DNA-adduct levels of the three HPV(-)
strains are well in line with that observation. In contrast
all three HPV(+) cell lines showed comparably low adduct
levels, even the highly cisplatin sensitive UPCI-SCC-154
cells. This suggests effective removal of cisplatin from
the primary lesions by the nucleotide excision repair
(NER) pathway but a deficiency in the processing of the
resulting repair intermediates. A similar phenotype was
previously observed in cisplatin hypersensitive CL-V5B
cells [19]. UPCI-SCC-154 cells were recently described to
be defective in homologous recombination repair (HRR)
due to the high expression of p16 and/or the inability
to form Rad51 foci [20, 21]. HRR is required for repair
steps after cisplatin excision, especially in the repair of
interstrand crosslinks in the S and G2-phase [22]. Whilst
an HRR defect could therefore explain the sensitivity of
UPCI-SCC-154, cisplatin resistant UM-SCC-47 cells
were described to be equally HRR deficient [21] and also
express similar levels of p16 [11]. Therefore additional
research into the underlying mechanisms is required to
fully explain these interesting findings.
In contrast to many other studies we had chosen
experimental setups with long cisplatin incubation
periods to be able to work with physiologically low
concentrations [14, 23]. Cisplatin is stable in aqueous
solutions containing at least 0.45% NaCl (77mM) and is
routinely delivered and stored in 0.9% NaCl (154mM)
at room temperature. After cellular uptake, due to the
low intracellular chloride concentration the cisplatinbound chloride ligands are replaced by water, which
generates the active forms of cisplatin [15]. The chloride
concentration of the cell culture media used here is around
120mM, very similar to blood and interstitial body fluid.
Therefore it was unexpected for us to see that after 3
days of incubation cisplatin no longer demonstrated
any cytotoxicity. Nevertheless, in sensitive cell lines we
observed cellular responses increasing even beyond 72h
(Figures 2, 3). It is tempting to speculate that in patients
the same phenomenon may occur and contribute to
rapid detoxification in addition to renal elimination and
consequently also to treatment failure of resistant tumors.
Further research is necessary to clarify these issues.
RT is normally delivered in daily fractions of 2
Gy over about 6 weeks and only very few fractions
are administered synchronously with the addition of
cisplatin. We therefore chose a time point of three days

Discussion
In this project we asked whether HPV(+) HNSCC
cells are more sensitive towards cisplatin than HPV(-).
To answer this question we used a panel of five HPV(-)
and six HPV(+) strains. To the best of our knowledge
this HPV(+) panel contains all cell lines derived from
primary, untreated HPV(+) HNSCC that have been
described in the literature. Proliferation was found to
be somewhat more severely inhibited in HPV(+) strains
(Figure 1) but this was not accompanied by a generally
enhanced cytotoxicity as assessed by the ability to form
colonies under cisplatin treatment (Figure 5A, 5B). In
both panels the sensitivity towards cisplatin shows huge
variations. This is likely to represent the situation in
the clinic and so far no predictive biomarker for tumor
sensitivity towards cisplatin has been established for
routine clinical use. This variation in cisplatin sensitivity
also demonstrates the necessity to use large cohorts of
cell lines because a comparison of e.g. 2 HPV(+) vs. 2
HPV(-) strains would simply yield random results. Using
a number of different approaches, we did not observe any
differences in the cellular responses, namely cell cycle
distribution, apoptosis induction and γH2AX formation,
upon cisplatin treatment in matched pairs of HPV(+) and
HPV(-) cell lines with similar sensitivity (Figures 2, 3).

after cisplatin administration where marked differences
in the cellular cisplatin responses were evident between
cell lines of different cisplatin sensitivity. Using this
setup cell survival will depend on both the resulting
cellular radiosensitivity and on cell proliferation between
seeding and irradiation. As observed before [11] HPV(+)
strains were more radiosensitive than HPV(-). Using the
individual IC50 of cisplatin for each cell line we observed
only moderate synergistic effects and, importantly, only
in a minority of strains (Figure 6A). Using a higher
concentration (IC75) and an earlier time point of 6h after
cisplatin administration we observed partly different
results (Figure 6B). Cisplatin resistant HSC4 cells were
sensitized only at the earlier time point, which can be
easily explained by the marked recovery of these cells
after 72h (Figure 2A, 2B). The sensitive strains SAT and
93-VU-147T, however, were not sensitized under any of
these conditions and, unexpectedly, the intermediately
sensitive UD-SCC-2 cells demonstrated a higher reduction
in cell survival with the lower concentration at the later
time point (1.74 fold averaged over all three dose points)
as compared to treatment with the higher concentration
at the earlier time point (1.38 fold averaged over all three
dose points). These results show that on the cellular level
the enhancement of radiation sensitivity of HNSCC
tumor cells by cisplatin is diverse and can depend on the
experimental setup, which may explain the differences
between our and another recent study [13]. Our results
call into question whether cisplatin - besides its cytotoxic
effects - can efficiently sensitize HNSCC tumors towards
radiation. However, it needs to be considered that in vivo
additional mechanisms, such as the inhibition of tumor cell
repopulation during the course of therapy may also play
a role. After all, the benefit in five-year overall survival
that cisplatin adds to radiotherapy in HNSCC patients is
in the range of 10% [24, 25], which is well in line with
a reasonable number of tumors showing considerable
resistance against cisplatin mediated cytotoxicity and
enhancement of radiation induced cell killing.
Currently three similar phase 3 trials are testing the
replacement of cisplatin by cetuximab in combination
with RT in HPV(+) oropharyngeal squamous cell
carcinomas(OPSCC) with curative intent (De-ESCALaTE,
RTOG1016, TROG12.01). While our data suggest that
HPV(+) tumors may not possess a generally enhanced
sensitivity towards cisplatin, they still show that cisplatin
can be highly toxic and lead to a further increase in cell
kill when combined with irradiation, the latter preferably
in HPV(+) strains. Therefore the addition of cetuximab
should at least be similarly effective in order not to
jeopardise the high cure rates achieved with cisplatinbased RCT. In this context a subgroup analysis of the
Bonner trial showed that p16-positive OPSCC had a
higher benefit from the addition of cetuximab to irradiation
as compared to p16-negative OPSCC [26]. Other trials
and data, however, heavily question the use of EGFR

inhibition in combination with irradiation and especially
chemoirradiation in both HPV(-) and HPV(+) HNSCC
[27-31]. Using five of the six HPV(+) cell lines also used
here we previously did not find any radiosensitizing effect
of cetuximab [32]. In contrast, inhibitors of Chk1 and
PARP conferred radiosensitization [32, 33]. Therefore,
from a radiobiological perspective we suggest that
replacing cisplatin with inhibitors of DNA repair or the
DNA damage response may be more promising than the
use of EGF-pathway inhibitors and should be investigated
further in in-vivo preclinical studies for a potential clinical
use in deintensified regimes.

Materials and methods
Cells and cell culture
All cell lines were grown in DMEM (Gibco)
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS)
(BiochromeAG) and 2mM glutamine (Gibco) at 37° C,
10% CO2 and 100% humidification. All HPV(+) and
HPV(-) cell lines utilized were described previously [11,
34], except UPCI-SCC-90 ( = UPCI:SCC:90 ; obtained
from the German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell
Lines (DSMZ), originally deposited by Prof. S. Gollin,
Pittsburgh, USA). All cells were identified by a short
tandem repeat multiplex assay (Applied Biosystems).
Cisplatin was generally administered to exponentially
growing cells 3 h after seeding.

Cell proliferation and colony formation assay
For cell proliferation analysis, 5 x 104 cells were
seeded into T25 cell culture flasks and treated with various
doses of cisplatin 3 h later. The numbers of cells were
assessed after 5 days and the number of cells initially
seeded was subtracted. Results were normalized to the
respective untreated control.
Cytotoxicity was determined in a preplating colony
formation assay. Briefly, subconfluent cell cultures were
seeded in defined numbers into T25 cell culture flasks and
treated with cisplatin 3 h later. After 1 week the cells were
washed with PBS and incubated in fresh medium without
cisplatin. Incubation for colony formation varied between
2 and 6 weeks depending on the doubling time of the
respective cell line. Additional irradiation was performed
as indicated. Samples treated with cisplatin and/or
irradiation were allowed to grow for an extended period of
time, as colony formation in some strains was apparently
delayed. The number of colonies containing more than 50
cells was assessed. In the case of UM-SCC-47, all samples
were seeded with 5000 feeder cells (UM-SCC-47; 20
Gy) per flask to support plating efficiency and for slowly
proliferating cells (UPCI-SCC-154, UPCI-SCC-90 and

and purity of the DNA were determined photometrically,
DNA integrity was confirmed using agarose gel
electrophoresis and ethidiumbromide staining. 0.5 μg of
the genomic DNA was diluted with TE buffer up to 100 μl,
denatured (10 min, 95 °C) and subsequently cooled on ice
before 100 μl ice cold ammonium acetate (2 M) (MERCK)
was added. The DNA was transferred onto a nitrocellulose
membrane soaked in 1 M ammonium actate by using a
vacuum pump. After washing (1 M ammonium acetate
and water), the membrane was incubated with 5 x SSC
(10 x SSC: 1.5 M NaCl (VWR International), 150 mM
sodium citrate (MERCK), pH 7.0) for 5 min and baked
for 2 h at 80 °C before it was blocked in 5 % non-fat milk
in TBS/0.1 % Tween 20 (over night; 4 °C). After washing
(TBS/0.1 % Tween 20) incubation with the primary
antibody directed against Pt-(GpG) intrastrand crosslinks
[17] was performed (1 h; RT). After a further washing
step peroxidase-conjugated anti-rat IgG secondary
antibody was added (2 h; RT). Pt-(GpG) intrastrand
crosslinks were detected by chemiluminescence using
the Fusion FX7 imaging system. Autoradiographies were
densitometrically analyzed with ImageJ 1.48r. To ensure
equal loading, the membrane was stained with methylene
blue (MP Biomedicals).

Cell cycle assessment
Cells were harvested, fixed with 70% ethanol,
briefly washed with PBS/0.2% Triton X-100 and
subsequently incubated with 100 ng/ml RNAse A and 10
µg/ml propidium iodide in PBS/0.2% Triton X-100 for
30 min at room temperature in the dark. Flow cytometric
analysis was performed using a FACS Canto with FACS
Diva Software (Becton Dickinson). The portion of cells
in the respective cell cycle phases was calculated using
ModFit LTTM software (Verity Software House, Inc.).

Caspase activity
Detection of caspase activity was performed
utilizing the FAM-FLICA™ Poly Caspases Assay Kit
(Immunochemistry Technologies) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Flow cytometric analysis was
performed on a FACS Canto with FACS Diva Software
(Becton Dickinson).

X-irradiation

γH2AX assessment

Cells were irradiated at room temperature with 200
kV X-rays (Gulmay RS225, Gulmay Medical Ltd., 15 mA,
0.8 mm Be + 0.5 mm Cu filtering, dose rate - 1.2Gy/min).

Cells were harvested, fixed with PBS/4%
formaldehyde for 10 min and permeabilized with
PBS/0.2% Triton X-100 before blocking for 30 min
with PBS/3% BSA /0.2% Triton X-100. The cells were
subsequently incubated (1h; RT) with a mouse-antiγH2AX antibody (clone JBW301, Millipore) in blocking
solution, washed four times with PBS/0.1 % Tween20
before incubation (1h; RT) with anti-mouse DyLight488
(Jackson Immunoresearch) and were then washed again
four times. DNA counterstaining was performed using
FxCycle FarRed (Molecular Probes) plus 100 ng/ml
RNAse A and 0,2% Triton X-100 for 30 min at room
temperature in the dark. Flow cytometric analysis was
performed using a FACS Canto with FACS Diva Software
(Becton Dickinson).

Data evaluation
Data analysis and statistical evaluation were
performed using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software,
Inc.). All experiments were performed at least three
times and values presented are mean ± SD unless noted
otherwise. Statistical evaluation was performed using
repeated measures (RM) two-way ANOVA test for
analysis of whole data sets and post-hoc analyses (HolmSidak) to further assess the levels of significance at
individual time or dose points.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

Analysis of cisplatin-induced formation of DNA
intrastrand crosslinks

We thank Jürgen Thomale for providing the Pt(GpG) adduct specific antibody.

ConflictS of Interest

The level of Pt-(GpG) intrastrand crosslinks was
determined by Southwestern blot analysis. To this end,
cells were treated with cisplatin as indicated and harvested
by trypzination. Cell pellets were immediately frozen
at -80°C until extraction of genomic DNA using the
NucleoSpin Tissue Kit (Macherey Nagel). Concentration
