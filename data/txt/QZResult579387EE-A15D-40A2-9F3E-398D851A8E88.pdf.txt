BACKGROUND: Little is known about the utility of central nervous system (CNS) prophylaxis for diffuse large B-cell
lymphoma (DLBCL) in the rituximab era. The objective of this study was to characterize patterns of CNS prophylaxis
for patients who received combined rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (R-CHOP)
chemotherapy using the National Comprehensive Cancer Network Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma Outcomes Database, a
prospective cohort study that collects clinical and outcomes data for patients at 7 participating centers. METHODS:
Patients who were eligible for this analysis presented with newly diagnosed DLBCL between January 2001 and July
2008, had no evidence of baseline CNS disease, and had received R-CHOP within 180 days of diagnosis. The authors
assessed incidence and covariates of prophylaxis, prophylaxis modality, and, using propensity score analysis, outcomes such as overall survival. RESULTS: Of 989 eligible patients, 117 received CNS prophylaxis (11.8%), most intrathecally (71.8%). Involvement of bone marrow, other high-risk site, >1 extranodal site, higher International Prognostic
Index score, and higher stage were associated individually with the receipt of prophylaxis (all P < .0001). At a median
follow-up of 2.5 years, there were 20 CNS recurrences (2% [95% confidence interval, 1.1%-2.9%]) among all patients,
and overall survival was not affected by prophylaxis. CONCLUSIONS: Given the overall low rate of CNS recurrence
and lack of prophylaxis-associated survival benefit, the current data called into question the practice of CNS prophyC 2011 American Cancer Society.

INTRODUCTION
Although the rate of central nervous system (CNS) disease in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL)
is relatively low (range, 3%-5%),1-3 the associated mortality rate is high.4 For this reason, clinicians and researchers have
long desired to identify subgroups of patients with an elevated baseline risk of developing CNS disease so that they can
administer prophylaxis against its occurrence.1-11 Historically, prophylaxis has been given based on the involvement of
perceived high-risk sites, including bone marrow as well as testis, sinus, or orbit.4,6,12-14 In recent studies, elevated lactate
dehydrogenase (LDH), the involvement of >1 extranodal site, their combination, and an elevated International Prognostic Index (IPI) score also have emerged as clinical risk factors associated with CNS recurrence.1-4,7,8,11
Despite the identification of such high-risk clinical factors, it is believed that practices are highly variable regarding
CNS prophylaxis.15-17 For example, in the German High-Grade Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma Study Group trial

CNS Prophylaxis for DLBCL/Kumar et al

RICOVER-60, despite protocol guidelines mandating intrathecal methotrexate for patients with bone marrow
involvement, approximately 58% of treating physicians
chose not to administer it to such patients.5 In addition to
various practices regarding the administration of prophylaxis, it also remains unclear which modality (intrathecal
or systemic) is optimal.2,18-21
Practice patterns and outcomes associated with
CNS prophylaxis have not been well characterized after
the adoption of rituximab as a standard component of
DLBCL therapy. Although a randomized controlled trial
would be the best way to assess outcomes associated with
CNS prophylaxis, such a study is not feasible given the
low incidence of CNS relapse among all patients with
DLBCL. Therefore, we took advantage of a large, multiinstitutional, prospectively followed cohort, the National
Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL) Outcomes Database, to analyze
the outcomes of patients who did and did not receive
CNS prophylaxis, controlling for possible selection bias
through the use of a propensity score. Our objective was
to characterize the incidence of CNS prophylaxis and the
factors associated with administration of prophylaxis in
patients with DLBCL who were treated in the rituximab
era. We also aimed to describe the incidence and risk factors for CNS relapse for all patients in the cohort and to
compare rates of CNS relapse and overall survival (OS) in
patients who did and did not receive prophylaxis.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Data Source
The NCCN NHL Outcomes Project is an ongoing, multicenter, prospective cohort study that collects comprehensive clinical, treatment, and outcome data for patients
with NHL. It was established on July 1, 2000. Seven institutions contributed patients to this analysis: City of Hope
Cancer Center (Duarte, Calif), Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (Boston, Mass), Fox Chase Cancer Center (Philadelphia, Pa), The University of Texas M. D. Anderson
Cancer Center (Houston, Tex), Northwestern University
Feinberg School of Medicine (Chicago, Ill), Roswell Park
Cancer Institute (Buffalo, NY), and University of Michigan Cancer Center (Ann Arbor, Mich). The institutional
review boards at all participating centers approved the
data-collection protocol.
All patients with newly diagnosed DLBCL who presented to participating centers between January 1, 2001
and July 1, 2008 were eligible for inclusion in this analy-

sis. Exclusion criteria included DLBCL arising from
another lymphoma, chemotherapy other than rituximab,
cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (R-CHOP), lack of first-line therapy within 180
days from the date of diagnosis, or evidence of CNS disease at baseline. R-CHOP was administered according to
standard protocol on a 21-day cycle.22 CNS prophylaxis
was administered at the discretion of individual oncologists at each participating NCCN center. CNS prophylaxis was defined as intrathecal if 2 doses of intrathecal
methotrexate and/or cytarabine were given or systemic if
1 dose of systemic methotrexate was administered. The
existence of baseline CNS involvement was abstracted
from medical records, including lumbar puncture pathology reports (positive cytology or flow cytometry), brain
biopsy pathology reports, and/or radiographic studies.
Definition of High-Risk Features
For the univariable analyses of factors associated with
CNS prophylaxis and risk factors for CNS relapse, we
assessed several high-risk features classically associated
with CNS recurrence, including older age (>60 years),
advanced stage (III or IV), bone marrow involvement,
other high-risk site involvement (orbit, testis, peripheral
blood, bone/vertebrae, nasal/paranasal sinuses), presence
of B symptoms, higher IPI score (high-intermediate or
high), elevated (>normal) LDH, an Eastern Cooperative
Oncology Group performance status >2, and >1 site of
extranodal involvement. To assess the likelihood of receiving prophylaxis in the setting of an increasing number of
risk factors, we planned to use the factors associated with
CNS recurrence in our cohort in the analysis described
above; or if no factors or only 1 factor were identified as
significant, then we planned to extrapolate from prior
studies to analyze a standard subset of 4 factors: >1 extranodal site, elevated LDH, bone marrow involvement, or
other high-risk site involvement.1-14
Definition of Relapse
CNS relapse was defined as leptomeningeal, brain parenchymal, or intradural involvement with lymphoma, as
documented by pathologic or radiologic criteria,
abstracted from medical records by NCCN study staff.
Systemic relapse was defined as any relapse, including
CNS relapse.
Statistical Analysis

For incidence and patterns-of-care analyses, categorical data were compared using chi-square tests or Fisher

exact tests. For continuous variables, either t tests or Wilcoxon rank-sum tests were used. Given the small number
of patients who received CNS prophylaxis and the relatively large number of covariates for inclusion in the
model, the approach for OS and disease-free survival
(DFS) was modified to ensure stability of the parameter
estimates. To control for potential confounding factors
associated with the receipt of CNS prophylaxis, a matched
cohort survival analysis using propensity scores was performed.23 Patients who received CNS prophylaxis were
matched with patients who did not receive CNS prophylaxis on a 1:1 basis using a propensity score method.23
Logistic regression was used to calculate each patient’s
propensity score, estimating their likelihood of being prescribed CNS prophylaxis, conditional upon the observed
covariates. The following independent variables were
included in the logistic regression model for matching:
aged >60 years at diagnosis, sex, stage I/II versus stage III/
IV, involvement of bone marrow at initial diagnosis,
involvement of other high-risk site at initial diagnosis, >1
site of extranodal involvement, LDH above normal levels,
and low/low-intermediate IPI versus high/high-intermediate IPI.
Kaplan-Meier analysis based on the propensity score
matching was used to compare OS and DFS between
patients who did and did not receive CNS prophylaxis.
The log-rank test was used to identify statistically significant differences in OS and DFS between therapy groups.
Follow-up for OS was defined as the time in years from
the date of initial diagnosis to the date of either death or
last known vital status. DFS follow-up was defined as the
time from initial diagnosis to the date of either date of
death or relapse (which ever occurred first) or the date of
last known vital status. Vital status was ascertained from
medical records and was confirmed using the Social Security Death Index and the National Death Index databases.24 All statistical analyses were performed using the
SAS statistical software package (version 9.2; SAS Institute, Cary, NC).

RESULTS
In total, 1326 patients with newly diagnosed DLBCL
were identified in the database, and 989 of those patients
met inclusion criteria. The median age was 58 years,
44.4% of patients were women, and 70.2% had low or
low-intermediate IPI scores. Of these, 117 patients
received CNS prophylaxis (11.8% [95% confidence interval, 9.8%-13.8%]). Table 1 lists the variables that were

2946

associated individually with receiving CNS prophylaxis.
Patients with other high-risk site involvement, bone marrow involvement, >1 extranodal site involvement, higher
IPI score (high or high-intermediate), and advanced stage
(III or IV) were significantly more likely to receive CNS
prophylaxis (all P < .0001); those with elevated LDH or
the presence of B-symptoms were not. It is noteworthy
that age, sex, race/ethnicity, performance status, and treatment center were not associated significantly with CNS
prophylaxis.
Of the patients who received CNS prophylaxis,
71.8% received intrathecal therapy, and 28.2% received
systemic therapy. There were significant center-specific
differences regarding the type of CNS prophylaxis used (P
< .0001). In addition, other high-risk site involvement
was associated with the receipt of systemic versus intrathecal prophylaxis (P ¼ .04), whereas older mean age was
associated with the reverse (P ¼ .05). Figure 1 indicates
that patients who had an increasing number of the 4 predefined high-risk features (>1 site of extranodal involvement, elevated LDH, bone marrow involvement, or other
high-risk site involvement) were increasingly likely to
receive CNS prophylaxis (P < .0001). Of all patients in
the cohort who had 2 high-risk features (n ¼ 284),
26.1% received CNS prophylaxis; and, of those who had
4 high-risk features (n ¼ 18), 61.1% received prophylaxis.
With minimum follow-up of 6 months and a median follow-up of 2.5 years, there were 20 CNS recurrences (2% [95% confidence interval, 1.1%-2.9%]). Ten
percent of CNS relapses (n ¼ 2) occurred from 4 to 6
months after diagnosis, whereas 90% occurred 6
months after diagnosis (n ¼ 18). The median number of
days from the initial date of diagnosis to CNS relapse was
390 days. The majority of CNS relapses were parenchymal only (65%) and occurred in isolation (70%), and not
in the context of systemic relapse. With median follow-up
of 1 year, the majority of patients with CNS relapse died
(75%).
Risk factors that were associated individually with
CNS relapse are listed in Table 2. High-intermediate or
high IPI scores were associated with an increased risk of
CNS relapse (P ¼ .02), and poor performance status also
trended toward significance (P ¼ .09). It is noteworthy
that, among all patients who had high-intermediate or
high IPI scores (n ¼ 295), the incidence of CNS relapse
was 3.7%, and there was a significantly higher incidence
of CNS relapse in those who received prophylaxis
(10.9%) versus those who did not (2.1%; P ¼ .007). For
those who had 2 predefined high-risk features (n ¼

284), the rate of CNS relapse was 2.5%, and the rate
did not differ significantly different for those who did
receive prophylaxis (5.4%) versus those who did not
(1.4%; P ¼ .08).
The demographic and clinical characteristics of the
patients who were available for analysis after propensity
score matching (n ¼ 230) yielded no statistically significant clinical or demographic differences between those
who did and did not receive CNS prophylaxis, as expected
(see Table 3); although the CNS relapse rate was slightly
higher (3.5% vs 2% in the overall cohort). Among the
propensity score-matched patients, there was no significant difference in OS (see Fig. 2) or PFS (data not shown)
in a comparison of patients who did and did not receive
prophylaxis.

DISCUSSION
In this ‘‘real-world’’ analysis of patients with newly diagnosed DLBCL, we observed no standard of care for CNS
prophylaxis with respect to either its administration or its
modality. To our knowledge, this represents 1 of the largest analyses to date of patterns of CNS prophylaxis and
associated outcomes. Rates of prophylaxis were modest
even among patients who had several high-risk features.
Rates of CNS recurrence were low in the total cohort and
even among high-risk patients defined by the cohort itself
as well as by using a standard set of risk factors. Moreover,
using propensity score methods, we observed no difference in survival according to the receipt of CNS
prophylaxis.
We observed low rates of administration of CNS
prophylaxis, even among high-risk patients. High-risk site

involvement and bone marrow involvement, factors historically associated with the administration of prophylaxis,4,6,12-14 were associated with the receipt of CNS
prophylaxis in our cohort; and, despite more recent studies demonstrating that elevated LDH, >1 extranodal site,
and higher IPI are associated independently with CNS
relapse, these factors were not associated with high rates of
prophylaxis. This finding may reflect delayed uptake of
recent trial data or the current NCCN guidelines, which
recommend intrathecal CNS prophylaxis only for patients
with high-risk site involvement (paranasal sinus, testicular, bone marrow, epidural, breast) or multiple extranodal
sites yet, to date, do not mention elevated LDH or elevated IPI score.
We also noted that differences in the modality of
prophylaxis, whether intrathecal or systemic, largely were
mediated by treatment center. This suggests that local
practice preferences rather than clinical trial data are driving clinical decision making, which is most likely to occur
when clinical trial data are contradictory. Indeed, 2 large,
prospective randomized controlled trials performed in the
pre-R-CHOP era, the Southwest Oncology Group and
French Adult Lymphoma Study Group studies, reported
inconsistent results about the efficacy of CNS prophylaxis.2,19 In addition, several retrospective, single-institution cohort studies also reported conflicting results on the
efficacy of intrathecal versus intravenous chemoprophylaxis.18,20-21
The rate of CNS recurrence in our study was lower
than that reported in other studies performed in the rituximab era.5,8,9 This may be explained by the relative youth

(median age, 58 years) and better prognostic profile of our
cohort (low or low-intermediate IPI scores in approximately 70%). Indeed, a recently presented study of
younger patients aged 60 years who received rituximab
reported a similar rate of CNS relapse (2.3%).25 In addition, there may have been higher rates of detection of
CNS disease at baseline in our study because of routine
CNS imaging and lumbar puncture with cerebrospinal
fluid studies (by cytology or flow cytometry) at the time
of diagnosis, which would decrease our observed recurrence rate. This would be consistent with our finding that
the majority of patients in our cohort had late CNS recurrences in contrast to other studies, which reported predominantly early relapses, suggesting that occult CNS
disease was present at the time of diagnosis.2,9,26
Our finding of predominantly isolated, parenchymal CNS relapses is similar to that reported in the British

Cancer

June 1, 2012

Columbia Cancer Agency study for rituximab-treated
patients.9 In the RICOVER-60 trial, patients who
received R-CHOP also were more likely to have an isolated CNS relapse, but a greater proportion of recurrences
were leptomeningeal versus parenchymal only.5 The data
from those studies and our own suggest that, although the
administration of rituximab may mediate superior control
of systemic disease, it fails to completely eliminate the risk
of CNS relapse, perhaps because of incomplete CNS
penetration.
By using propensity score analysis, we found that
CNS prophylaxis was not associated with a reduction in
CNS relapse or OS. Therefore, we wonder whether CNS
prophylaxis has little clinical benefit and whether it is
worth its considerable cost, both to patients’ quality of
life and the health care system. Even among high-risk
patients—those with elevated IPI scores as defined by our

makers, as well as outcomes, such as patient-reported
quality of life.
In summary, perhaps reflecting the continued
national controversy regarding its use, we observed wide
variation in CNS prophylaxis practices for DLBCL. In
addition, with such low rates of CNS relapse (even among
patients classically considered at high risk) and no evidence of a survival benefit, the numbers needed to treat to
prevent death from CNS relapse would be quite high
based on our findings. For clinicians who choose not to
offer CNS prophylaxis for patients in the rituximab treatment era, our data are reassuring. Indeed, unless better
markers of elevated CNS relapse risk can be identified, it
may be time to seriously re-evaluate or even completely
abandon this practice.

data or with 2 predefined high-risk features—the rates of
CNS relapse were low (3.7% and 2.5%, respectively).
These rates of CNS relapse do not seem high enough to
warrant the administration of potentially toxic and likely
ineffective prophylaxis regimens. Indeed, many physicians
in our study opted against administering prophylaxis in
these high-risk patients. Future efforts might move beyond
clinical factors toward risk stratification based on biologic
tumor markers—such as MYC rearrangement or Ki-67—
that may define a subgroup with such a significantly elevated risk of relapse that prophylaxis would be
warranted.27
Our analysis has limitations. First, as with any database that relies on abstracted medical records, despite our
extensive efforts toward quality control, we cannot be certain that the administration of prophylaxis or even the
presence of CNS recurrence was captured in every case.
Next, the patterns of prophylaxis observed at our 7 participating tertiary care centers may not be generalizable to
those in community-based practices. In addition, we
excluded patients who were treated on regimens other
than R-CHOP, and some of those patients who received
alternate, highly aggressive chemotherapy regimens may
have been at particularly high risk for CNS involvement.
