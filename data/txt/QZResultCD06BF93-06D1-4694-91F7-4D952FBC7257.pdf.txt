BACKGROUND: Treatment options for patients with advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) are
scarce. This phase 2 study was conducted to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of dasatinib in this setting. METHODS: Patients with recurrent and/or metastatic HNSCC after platinum-based therapy were
treated with dasatinib either orally or via percutaneous feeding gastrostomy (PFG). Primary endpoints were 12-week
progression-free survival (PFS) and objective response rate with a 2-stage design and early withdrawal if the 12-week
PFS rate was 20% and no patients had an objective response (OR). Forty-nine serum cytokines and angiogenic factors (CAFs) were analyzed from treated patients. RESULTS: Of the 15 patients enrolled, 12 were evaluable for
response, and all patients were evaluable for toxicity. No OR was observed and 2 patients (16.7%) had stable disease
(SD) at 8 weeks. The median treatment duration was 59 days, the median time to disease progression was 3.9 weeks,
and the median survival was 26 weeks. One patient required a dose reduction, 3 patients required dose interruptions,
and 4 patients were hospitalized for toxicity. Dasatinib inhibited c-Src both when administered orally and via PFG.
Greater mean drug exposure, decreased half-life, and greater maximum concentration were observed in patients
receiving dasatinib via PFG. Eleven baseline CAFs were associated with treatment outcome and 1 CAF, macrophage
migration inhibitory factor, was found to be differentially modulated in correlation with SD versus disease progression. CONCLUSIONS: Single-agent dasatinib failed to demonstrate significant activity in patients with advanced
HNSCC, despite c-Src inhibition. The toxicity profile was consistent with that reported in other solid tumors, and the

Recurrent or metastatic disease is common in patients with advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma
(HNSCC), and although some are candidates for palliative chemotherapy, most will die within 1 year of disease recurrence.1 Molecular targeting has been confirmed as a relevant strategy in cancer therapeutics for other solid tumors and has
been an active area of preclinical and clinical investigation within the past decade in the setting of HNSCC. To our knowledge to date, only the addition of anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) antibody to standard platinum-based
chemotherapy has improved overall survival (OS).2 Single-agent trials with targeted agents have demonstrated promising
but modest results.3,4
c-Src is a nonreceptor cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase that regulates signals from cell surface molecules including growth
factor receptors and G protein-coupled receptors. They play a key role in modulating multiple cellular functions (including invasion, adhesion, motility, migration proliferation, and survival) by activating the signal transducer and activator of
transcription (STAT) family of transcription factors. Preclinical evaluations have provided a strong rationale for targeting
c-Src in HNSCC.5 c-Src inhibition using dasatinib (BMS-354825), a potent inhibitor of src-family kinases EphA2,

platelet-derived growth factor (PDGFR), Abl, BTK, and
c-kit, in HNSCC cell lines in vitro has led to cell cycle
arrest and apoptosis.6 In human HNSCC, c-Src7,8 is overexpressed and correlated with lymph node metastases.8
Based on this encouraging preclinical information,
we conducted a phase 2 trial of single-agent dasatinib in
patients with platinum-refractory recurrent metastatic
HNSCC. The primary objective of this trial was to determine the 12-week progression-free survival (PFS) and
objective response rate (ORR) to single-agent dasatinib.
Secondary objectives were to measure the metabolic
response rate by positron emission tomography (PET)
scan at 8 weeks and 12 weeks; define OS; define duration
of response; determine whether there was a correlation
between clinical benefit from dasatinib and pharmacokinetics (PK), progressive disease (PD), or changes in serum
levels of cytokines, growth factors, and growth factor
receptors relevant to the c-Src signaling pathway; and to
describe the PK profile, relative bioavailability, and safety
of dasatinib suspension in patients receiving the drug
through a percutaneous feeding gastrostomy (PFG) tube.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Design and Treatment
The current study was a 2-stage, open-label phase 2 study
to characterize the efficacy and safety of dasatinib treatment in patients with recurrent or metastatic HNSCC
who were previously treated with 1 prior chemotherapeutic regimen. The primary dual endpoint of this study
was 12-week PFS and ORR. A 2-stage Bayesian design
was used that required stopping the trial for futility if
fewer than 5 of 15 patients had not progressed by 12
weeks and if less than 2 of these 15 patients had experienced an objective response (OR). All patients received
dasatinib at a dose of 100 mg orally twice daily and 1 cycle
was 28 days in duration. The dasatinib was generously
provided by Bristol-Myers Squibb and the National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health. If patients
were unable to swallow, dasatinib could be administered
via a PFG tube after being mixed in lemonade. Treatment
was intended to continue until PD, illness that prevented
further treatment, an unacceptable agent-related adverse
event, drug-related toxicity not alleviated by 2 consecutive
dose reductions, failure to recover to less than grade 2 toxicity within 14 days of interruption of treatment, withdrawal of consent, or at the discretion of the investigator.
Dose reductions were performed for grade 3 hematologic toxicity or grade 2 hemorrhage, bleeding, or coa-

gulopathy without thrombocytopenia to 150 mg daily (-1
dose level) and 50 mg twice daily (-2 dose level). For grade
3 or 4 bleeding or coagulopathy, treatment was discontinued, whereas for significant QTc (QT interval corrected
for heart rate) prolongation (>550 milliseconds [ms]) to
which dasatinib was believed to have contributed, a 2dose level reduction was implemented. Fluid retention,
including pleural effusions, was controlled early with the
institution of diuresis; steroids were used at the discretion
of the treating physician. Thoracentesis was performed for
persistent and symptomatic effusions.
Eligibility
Patients with histologically proven HNSCC that was
recurrent after surgery and/or radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy or those with metastatic disease were eligible
for the trial if they had received 1 prior systemic therapy
regimen. Other eligibility requirements included measurable disease by Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid
Tumors (RECIST), age 18 years, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 to
1, and adequate organ and bone marrow function (absolute neutrophil count 1.5  109/L, platelet count 100
 109/L, hemoglobin 9 g/dL, total bilirubin 1.5 
the institutional upper limit of normal [ULN], albumin
2.5 g/dL, aspartate aminotransferase/alanine aminotransferase 1.5 the ULN, and creatinine 3 mg/dL).
Patients who were pregnant or breastfeeding and those of
childbearing potential who were not practicing contraception or sexual abstinence were excluded. Brain metastases
were permitted if the patient did not require anticonvulsants or corticosteroids or was either >4 weeks beyond
cranial irradiation or was believed not to require it at the
time of study enrollment. Exclusion criteria included
chemotherapy or palliative radiotherapy for recurrent
and/or metastatic disease within 3 weeks, failure to
recover from adverse events (to grade 1 or less), concurrent treatment with potent inhibitors or inducers of cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4), myocardial infarction or
ventricular arrhythmia within 6 months, QTc prolongation >480 ms, or major conduction abnormality. All
patients provided written informed consent before trial
enrollment.
Study Assessments
Baseline evaluations within 28 days before the initiation
of dasatinib included full medical history, physical examination, ECOG performance status assessment, electrocardiogram (EKG), laboratory tests, baseline PET/computed

tomography scan, and any additional radiology studies as
indicated. Radiographic response, determined by
RECIST criteria, was planned at 4 weeks and then every 8
weeks thereafter, whereas metabolic response, determined
by PET, was planned for 12 weeks. Patients were assessed
at the beginning of each cycle of therapy for adverse events
by physical examination, laboratory tests, and EKG. All
adverse events were recorded and graded using the
National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria
(version 3.0) and patients were followed for at least 4
weeks after removal from the study or, for those removed
from the study for adverse events, until resolution or stabilization of the event. Patients had an off-study visit 3 to 5
weeks after study discontinuation and were followed via
mail or telephone until death. Hospice patients were followed via telephone.

Chromatographic separation was performed after a 20-lL
injection on a Phenomenex Luna C8, 50  2.1 mm, 3lm analytical column heated to 60 C over 8 minutes at
0.35 mL/minute using 0.2% formic acid:methanol
(85:15 v:v) with a linear gradient to 100% methanol over
the first 3 minutes. The monitored transition (MRM) of
488.2 > 401.1 (m/z) had a retention time of 3.1  0.1
minutes in positive electrospray ionization mode. The calibration curve ranged from 1 to 1000 ng/mL in single donor human plasma. PK parameter estimates were
generated from individual patient concentration-time
data using a noncompartmental model (WinNonLin [version 5.2]; Pharsight Corporation, Mountain View, Calif).
Pharmacodynamics and Cytokines and
Angiogenic Factor Analysis
Serum sample collection and preparation

PK Sampling and Assay
In patients receiving oral dasatinib, PK samples were collected on day 1 of cycle 1 at pre-dose (baseline) and 1, 2,
4, 6, and 10 hours after the time of administration. In
patients receiving dasatinib via PFG tube, samples were
collected on day 1 of cycle 1 at pre-dose (baseline) and 2
and 6 hours after the time of administration. Whole blood
was collected into sodium heparin BD Vacutainer tubes
(Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ). Each sample was
centrifuged to isolate plasma at 1500 revolutions per minute (rpm) for 10 minutes at 4 C. Two aliquots of plasma
were transferred to labeled polypropylene cryovials (Corning, Corning, NY) and stored at 70 C until analysis.
PK Analysis Methods
Dasatinib concentrations in plasma were determined
using a validated liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry assay with modifications.9 An Agilent 1100 Series LC
pump (Agilent, Santa Clara, Calif) with a 4 C autosampler was run in tandem with a Micromass Quattro Micro
mass spectrometer (Waters, Milford, Mass) using MassLynx/QuanLynx software for data acquisition and processing (Waters). Before drug extraction, the plasma was
acidified by adding 250 lL of 0.4% formic acid to 250 lL
of plasma. Solid-phase extraction was performed on an
Oasis HLB 30-mg, 1-mL cartridge (Waters) conditioned
with 2 mL of methanol followed by 2 mL of water,
washed with 2 mL of water followed by 1 mL of 5% methanol in water, and eluted with 1 mL of methanol:acetonitrile (50:50 volume:volume [v:v]). The eluent was dried at
40 C under gentle nitrogen gas stream and reconstituted
with 250 lL of 0.2% formic acid:methanol (70:30 v:v).

2114

Blood was drawn to evaluate circulating levels of serum cytokines and activated c-Src expression (pSrcY416)
in platelets before treatment (day 1 of cycle 1) and at day
1 of cycle 2 (pre-dose) of treatment in patients receiving
dasatinib orally and by PFG. Baseline serum was isolated
from blood samples from patients at day 1 of cycle 2 (predose) in 14 patients. After the sample was allowed to coagulate for 30 to 60 minutes, it was centrifuged for 15
minutes at 1000g to separate serum, which was then
placed in a cryovial and stored at 70 C until analysis.
Whole blood was collected into ethylenediamine
tetraacetic acid (EDTA)-Vacutainer tubes and immediately supplemented with citric acid dextrose (8.5 mM of
sodium citrate, 11 mM of dextrose, and 7 nM of citric
acid) and prostacyclin (50 ng/mL). Platelets were isolated
using serial centrifugation. Platelets were lysed and activated c-Src was measured using an enzyme-linked immunoadsorbent assay (ELISA) according to the
manufacturer’s protocol (Calbiochem, San Diego CA).
Samples were compared with a manufacturer-prepared
standard of platelets stimulated with ATP.
Multiplex bead assay and ELISA

Forty-nine cytokines and angiogenic factors (CAFs)
were measured by multiplex bead assay.10,11 These
included hypoxia-induced factors, chemokines, interleukins, angiogenic factors, apoptosis mediators, and hematopoietic growth factors (Table 1). Multiplex bead assays
were performed with BioSource Multiplex Assays for
Luminex (Invitrogen, Calsbad, Calif) in a 96-well format
according to the BioSource protocol. Multiplex bead assay
is a high-throughput technology that uses antibody-

Calculations

CAF concentrations were calculated based on a
standard curve derived by performing 6 serial dilutions of
a protein standard in assay diluent. Serum samples were
tested in duplicate and the mean value was used for analysis. If the mean of the duplicate values for all factors in an
individual sample varied by >25%, the sample was
retested. Individual factors were excluded from analysis if
50% of the serum values measured for that factor sample were either out of range or extrapolated. When out-ofrange values were included in the analysis, the highest
value (measured or extrapolated) across all samples was
substituted for values above the upper limit of detection.
For values below the lower limit of detection, half of the
lowest value was substituted. Both analytes were measured
in duplicate and the mean value used for analysis.

Endpoints and Statistical Analysis
The dual primary endpoint was the ORR, defined by
RECIST, and PFS evaluated on an intent-to-treat basis,
defined as the duration of time from the initiation of
treatment to the time of PD. Patient tumor characteristics
were tabulated. Descriptive statistics, including the mean,
median, and range, are provided for the continuous variable of patient age, whereas the frequency and percentage
are shown for categorical variables. OS was calculated
from the date of study entry to the date of death or last follow-up. The Kaplan-Meier method14 was used to estimate PFS and OS and the 95% confidence intervals (95%
CIs) were calculated. Differences between responders and
nonresponders with respect to PD endpoints were

predefined criteria for OR and PFS were not fulfilled. All
patients had previously received radiotherapy and the majority had received chemotherapy or had undergone surgical resection previously (93.3% and 73.3%, respectively).
Two patients were current smokers, 10 were former
smokers, and 3 were never smokers. Evaluation of disease
recurrence at the time of study entry revealed that 80% of
patients had local recurrence. No patients went on to
receive further therapy after discontinuing the trial.
OR, PFS, and OS
No complete or partial responses were reported among
the 12 patients who were evaluable for response. Two
patients had stable disease (SD) at 8 weeks (16.7%). One
patient had SD for >3 cycles of treatment. The 12-week
PFS rate based on the Kaplan-Meier curve for all patients
was 13.3% (95% CI, 0.022-0.346) (Fig. 1A). The median
PFS was 0.91 months (95% CI, 0.91 months-1.97

Toxicity
Table 3 summarizes the most common toxicities considered to be related to dasatinib. The most common toxicities were nausea and pleural effusion (40% for both),
although the severity was grade 1 to 2 in the majority of
cases. Grade 3 pleural effusion, dehydration, and anemia
occurred in 1 patient each. Overall, dasatinib was not
associated with severe hematological toxicities or laboratory changes. Seven patients discontinued therapy because
of PD, 4 patients discontinued for toxicity, 3 patients had
treatment interruptions for toxicity, and 4 were hospitalized for toxicity.
PFG PK Analysis
Plasma concentrations of dasatinib were available for a
small number of patients (n ¼ 3) who received the drug
via PFG. Because of sparse sampling in the patients who
were administered dasatinib by mouth, we were not able
to estimate any PK parameters. When compared with oral
ingestion of the drug in a previous phase 1 study in
patients with advanced solid tumors,15 there was greater
systemic drug exposure via PFG noted based on area
under the curve (AUC) comparison (AUC0-10 of 448.9
nghr/mL vs AUC0-10 of 218.0 nghr/mL). The maximum dasatinib plasma concentration was also greater in
PFG patients when compared with the phase 1 study
(168.2 ng/mL vs 56.0 ng/mL) whereas the elimination
half-life was shorter (2.1 hours vs 4.3 hours). These differences are most likely because of peak effects within 1.5
hours after administration caused by enhanced drug
absorption via PFG or a difference in the method of
administration, but they do warrant further investigation
to determine their nature. For those patients, we were able

to compare dasatinib plasma concentrations in this study;
there was no significant difference in drug concentrations
noted at 2 hours and 6 hours after dosing when comparing patients receiving oral dasatinib versus those who
received it via PFG (Fig. 2).
Pharmacodynamic Analysis
Four patients had measurement of activated c-Src (p-Src)
in platelets before the initiation of therapy and on day 21
at 0 hours, 2 hours, and 6 hours (Fig. 3). One patient only
had p-Src levels drawn before treatment and pre-dose on
day 21. The level of p-Src on day 21 at 0 hours (ie,
approximately 12 hours since the prior day’s dose) was
variable when compared with the pretreatment level; in 3
of 5 samples, the value was significantly lower (P < .05)
and in 2 cases there was no statistical difference (1 in
which it was lower [P ¼ .15] and 1 in which it was higher
[P ¼ .06]). In all 4 patients with the full panel drawn, the
level of p-Src was reduced below the level of detection 2
hours after dasatinib administration, which is consistent
with the rapid absorption of dasatinib observed in the PK
studies. In 3 of 4 patients, the level of p-Src remained
undetectable 6 hours after the administration of dasatinib.
Overall, these studies demonstrated that dasatinib led to a
universal, rapid, and complete inhibition of c-Src in
patients’ platelet counts, with a variable recovery 6 to 12
hours later (Fig. 3).
Cytokine Results
Fourteen patients had baseline levels and 9 had paired
samples. CAF levels (log2) were log2 transformed and

compared between patients with (n ¼ 12) and those without (n ¼ 2) PD by the Student t test. Eleven CAFs were
found to be significantly higher in patients who had PD
(P .05): cutaneous T cell-attracting chemokine
(CTACK), interferon (IFN)-a2, interleukin (IL)-2, IL12, IL-3, lymphocyte inhibitory factor (LIF), monocyte
chemotactic protein (MCP)-3, macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF), stem cell factor (SCF)-b, TNF-b
and b-nerve growth factor (b-NGF). Cytokine modulation was compared between patients with SD and those
who had disease that rapidly progressed. An increase in
MIF was noted in patients with rapidly PD (2945.7 pg/
mL) compared with patients with SD, in whom MIF was
noted to be decreased (-19,399 pg/mL) (P ¼ .07 by the
Student t test) (Table 4).

DISCUSSION
This single-center, open-label, phase 2 study met its
objectives to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK, and biological efficacy of dasatinib administered as a single agent
in patients with recurrent HNSCC. Dasatinib as a single
agent failed to demonstrate significant activity in patients
with advanced, metastatic HNSCC. The observed toxicity
profile was consistent with that reported in other solid
tumors, and the drug can be administered successfully via
PFG tube.
Many challenges exist in the development of novel
therapeutics against HNSCC. Phase 2 studies of molecularly targeted compounds in patients with recurrent or
metastatic HNSCC are beset with the challenge of identifying patients whose tumors demonstrate an OR, which is
unlikely to occur in more than 10% to 15% of the

in the current trial to identify those patients who may
derive benefit from dasatinib despite the lack of an OR.
However, we were unable to demonstrate that dasatinib
can reach the benchmark set by agents such as cetuximab,
gefitinib, or erlotinib (targeting for 6-month PFS rates of
15%).3,4,16,17
We also planned to investigate the baseline expression and possible modulation of serum cytokines that may
serve as biomarkers to define patients who may derive
more benefit from this agent in the current or in future trials. We analyzed cytokines in the serum and although no
significant activity was observed, we were able to characterize certain profiles of cytokines as being correlated with
outcome. All baseline cytokines and growth factors with
the exception of SCF-b, IL-17, and PDGF were higher in
nonresponders; however, several were significantly higher
in patients who demonstrated rapid disease progression,
including MIF.
Although proinflammatory cytokines were generally
found to be increased after treatment, MIF, a tumor

growth regulator, was higher after treatment in patients
with rapid disease progression and lower in patients who
achieved SD while receiving treatment. MIF is a lymphokine involved in cell-mediated immunity, immunoregulation, and inflammation, and plays a role in the regulation
of macrophage function in host defense through suppression of the anti-inflammatory effects of glucocorticoids.
Although the exact role of MIF in tumorigenesis remains
ambiguous, several reports are now linking MIF with
processes such as cell proliferation, differentiation, and tumor progression and metastasis and overexpression has
been reported in several solid tumors.18-21 MIF enhances
neoplastic cell invasion by inducing the expression of matrix metalloproteinase-9 and IL-8. It is also known to
stimulate angiogenic factor expression (vascular endothelial growth factor and IL-8).22 Despite evidence of the
effective inhibition of p-Src, dasatinib did not appear to
have an effect on tumor growth. It is possible that several
signaling pathways are activated in patients with advanced
HNSCC23 and therefore targeting p-Src is not sufficient.
In designing clinical trials in this setting, it is important to
consider the complexities of cell signaling in advanced
malignancies including HNSCC, which may result in upregulation of several feedback mechanisms when a single
target is hit. Taking that into consideration, an alternative
strategy in this setting is to simultaneously target 2 pathways, ideally with agents that do not possess overlapping
toxicity. Along these lines, further investigation of dasatinib in combination with EGFR inhibitors is currently
ongoing.
