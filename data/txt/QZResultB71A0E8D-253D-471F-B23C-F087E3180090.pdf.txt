Abstract
Radiotherapy combined with androgen depletion is generally successful for treating locally advanced prostate
cancer. However, radioresistance that contributes to recurrence remains a major therapeutic problem in many
patients. In this study, we define the high-affinity neurotensin receptor 1 (NTR1) as a tractable new molecular
target to radiosensitize prostate cancers. The selective NTR1 antagonist SR48692 sensitized prostate cancer cells
in a dose- and time-dependent manner, increasing apoptotic cell death and decreasing clonogenic survival. The
observed cancer selectivity for combinations of SR48692 and radiation reflected differential expression of NTR1,
which is highly expressed in prostate cancer cells but not in normal prostate epithelial cells. Radiosensitization
was not affected by androgen dependence or androgen receptor expression status. NTR1 inhibition in cancer
cell–attenuated epidermal growth factor receptor activation and downstream signaling, whether induced by
neurotensin or ionizing radiation, establish a molecular mechanism for sensitization. Most notably, SR48692
efficiently radiosensitized PC-3M orthotopic human tumor xenografts in mice, and significantly reduced tumor
burden. Taken together, our findings offer preclinical proof of concept for targeting the NTR1 receptor as a
strategy to improve efficacy and outcomes of prostate cancer treatments using radiotherapy. Cancer Res; 71(21);

Introduction
Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men and the
second leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States (1, 2).
Radiotherapy is one of the standard treatment modalities for
prostate cancer (3); however, a major obstacle to effective
radiotherapy is the limited radiation dose that can be safely
delivered to the prostate (<85 Gy; refs. 4, 5). Unfortunately, at
this dose level, a significant proportion of tumors are resistant
either not responding or recurring after treatment. An alternative to radiation dose increase would be to use radiosensitizing agents selectively targeted to prostate cancer cells while
sparing normal tissue, thus minimizing radiation toxicity by
lowering effective therapeutic doses.
Several different factors could participate in prostate cancer
development, progression, and resistance to antitumor therapy. One of such possible mechanisms involves intraprostate

neuroendocrine cells and their secretions, which can aid
cancer cell proliferation and survival. Neuroendocrine cells
exist in the normal prostate gland, regulating prostatic
growth, differentiation, and secretion. However, clusters of
neuroendocrine-like cells are also found in most prostate
cancer, and the presence of extensive neuroendocrine features
in tumors is an indication of increased aggressiveness and
androgen independence (6–8). These neuroendocrine-like
cells often arise from prostate cancer cells through the process
of neuroendocrine transdifferentiation (7, 9). The neuroendocrine-like cells secrete a variety of factors, including parathyroid hormone–related peptides, serotonin, calcitonin,
bombesin-related peptide, and neurotensin, that enhance
DNA synthesis, proliferation, and migration of prostate cancer
cells in vitro. In vivo, neuroendocrine-like cells can promote
androgen-independent LNCaP xenograft growth in castrated
mice (10, 11), supporting their role in prostate cancer androgen-independent growth.
One of the neuropeptides secreted by neuroendocrine-like
prostate cells is neurotensin (12), a 13 amino acid peptide, that
has numerous physiologic effects (13) mediated predominantly through its cognate high-affinity receptor, neurotensin
receptor 1 (NTR1). Similar to other G-protein–coupled receptors, stimulated NTR1 activates multiple pathways, namely,
mobilization of intracellular Ca2þ, production of cyclic AMP
and GMP, and formation of inositol triphosphate, resulting in
important physiologic responses in both the central nervous
system and periphery. However, it has been shown that
neurotensin has significant stimulatory activity in several
human neoplastic tissues (13–15). For example, NTR1 is

6817

expressed in 91% of invasive ductal breast cancer cases (16),
and its expression is associated with the grade and size of the
tumor and its invasive potential (17). Similarly, NTR1 is
expressed in most colon cancer cell lines and primary tumors,
especially in the highly invasive adenocarcinomas but not in
normal adult colon cells (18). In addition, neurotensin and
NTR1 expression has been implicated in the invasiveness of
head and neck squamous cell carcinomas, and high levels of
NTR1 expression are a predictive marker for a poor prognosis
(19). We and others have shown that NTR1 is expressed and
activated in aggressive prostate cancer cells (15, 20, 21) but not
in normal prostate epithelial cells. In such prostate cancer
cells, stimulation with neurotensin increased mitogen–activated protein kinase and phosphoinositide-3-kinase activation (22) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), Src,
and STAT5 phosphorylation (15, 22), resulting in enhanced
DNA synthesis, cell proliferation, and survival.
NTR1 signaling may not only be responsible for increased
proliferation but also for the intrinsic radioresistance of
prostate cancer cells. Thus, inhibition of the NTR1 receptor
and its downstream signaling represents a target to enhance
the sensitivity of prostate cancer to radiotherapy. NTR1 can be
selectively and efficiently inhibited by the commercially available small-molecule antagonist, SR48692 (meclinertant;
Sanofi-Aventis; refs. 23–25). SR48692 is a nonpeptide antagonist that binds preferentially to NTR1 and inhibits downstream signaling events such as EGFR and Src activation.
SR48692 has been shown in vitro to be effective in inhibiting
proproliferative and prosurvival signaling in colon (26), pancreatic (27, 28), head and neck (19), and prostate cancer cells
(15, 29). SR48692 has also shown promising activity in vivo in a
small lung cancer mouse model (30). However, its potential
use as a radiosensitizer has never been tested.
In the current study, we tested the hypothesis that inhibition of NTR1 by SR48692 would radiosensitize prostate cancer
cells and tumors. Our results show that, indeed, combined
treatment of SR48692 and radiation effectively kills cancer
cells in vitro and in vivo and suggest the need for clinical
testing to establish whether anti-NTR1 treatment combined
with radiotherapy may increase local control of the tumor and
decrease its metastatic potential.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines and reagents
PC-3M-luc-C6 (PC-3M) human prostate carcinoma cell line
transfected with the luciferase gene was purchased from Xenogen Corporation, which also provided luciferin. RWPE-1 (immortalized normal prostate epithelial cells) cell line was
obtained from American Type Culture Collection. These 2 cell
lines were authenticated by the suppliers, and fresh-frozen
stocks were used for the experiments. The LNCaP (androgen-dependent human prostate carcinoma) and C4-2B cell
lines (androgen-independent human prostate carcinoma) were
established and characterized by Dr. L. W. Chung at the
University of Virginia (31) and resuscitated from frozen stocks
prior to the experiments. All cell lines were maintained in a
37 C/5% CO2 humidified chamber in Dulbecco's Modified

6818

Cancer Res; 71(21) November 1, 2011

Eagle's Media supplemented with 10% FBS (PC-3M), RPMI
supplemented with 5% FBS (LNCaP and C4-2B), or serum-free
keratinocyte medium supplemented with EGF and bovine
pituitary extract (RWPE-1). Phenol red–free and serum-free
RPMI medium was used in all serum starvation experiments. All
cell culture media and reagents were purchased from Invitrogen. SR48692, a generous gift from Sanofi-Aventis, was dissolved in dimethyl formamide (DMF) as a 2 mmol/L stock and
stored at 80 C. Antibodies specific for EGFR, EGFR phosphotyrosine 992 and 845, and Src and Src phospho-tyrosine 416
were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology, pan-phosphotyrosine (Y20) from Abcam, and secondary antibodies conjugated to infrared dyes from LI-COR. SDS-PAGE electrophoresis,
agarose gel electrophoresis supplies, and PCR reagents were
obtained from BioRad. SMARTpool NTR1 and nontargeting
siRNA were obtained from Dharmacon. Other miscellaneous
reagents were purchased from Sigma Chemicals.
Drug treatment and irradiation
Incubation with SR48692 was conducted at 37 C at 1 mmol/L
and 24 hours before irradiation, except where noted. An
equivalent volume of drug vehicle (DMF) was added to the
control dishes (final concentration  0.01%). Drug-treated and
control cells were irradiated using a 220-keV X-ray irradiator
at a dose rate of 2 to 3 Gy/min and received a dose of 6 Gy,
except where noted. All irradiations were carried out at room
temperature, and the samples were returned to 37 C (for
further incubation) or lysed on ice (to assess immediate
effects).
Clonogenic survival assay
The assays were conducted as described previously (32). In
brief, exponentially growing cells were treated with SR48692 (or
sham treated with vehicle) and irradiated. Cells were trypsinized, rinsed, and counted, and appropriate numbers were
plated for the colony formation assay. After 10 to 14 days of
incubation, colonies consisting of more than 50 cells were
counted. All data points were determined in triplicate and
experiments were carried out at least 3 times. The experimental
results were fitted to standard linear quadratic dose–response
curves and corrected for effects induced by the drug treatment
alone. The dose enhancement ratio (DER) was defined as the
ratio between the radiation dose in the absence of radiosensitizer and the dose in the presence of radiosensitizer resulting in
the same reduction of cell survival to 37% (DER37).
Growth inhibition assay
Cells (100,000 cells per well) were plated in 6-wells plates,
allowed to attach, and treated with SR48692 for indicated
times. Attached cells were collected at indicated time points
and counted using trypan blue exclusion to discriminate live/
dead cells, or the cell number was estimated by sulforhodamine B staining of cellular proteins.
Cell lysates, immunoprecipitation, and Western
blotting
Cells were plated in 100-mm dishes (2  106 cells per
dish), allowed to attach overnight, and treated with SR48692

(or sham treated) as indicated in the Results section.
Following irradiation (6 Gy) and different postincubation
times, cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and harvested
on ice in CHAPS lysis buffer (0.6% CHAPS, 1% Triton X-100,
50 mmol/L Tris, pH ¼ 8.0, 150 mmol/L NaCl, 2 mmol/L
EDTA) supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Sigma; ref. 15). Lysates were clarified by centrifugation, and protein concentrations were quantified. To assess
whole-cell protein expression, equal amounts of protein
were resolved on 4% to 15% gradient gels, transferred to
nitrocellulose, and probed with specific antibodies. Infrared
dye–conjugated secondary antibodies were used for signal
development, and quantification of signal intensity was
conducted using a LiCOR Odyssey imager and software.
For immunoprecipitation, 1 mg of precleared protein lysate
was incubated overnight at 4 C with EGFR antibody (5 mL,
immunoprecipitation-specific mAb; Cell Signaling) or a
negative control antibody, with constant rocking. Protein
A/G agarose beads were then added, and immunoprecipitates were washed 3 times with lysis buffer. Finally, samples
were eluted with 2 sample buffer (100 C/5 minutes) and
subjected to Western blotting procedure as described
above.

In vivo orthotopic human prostate cancer xenografts
Human PC-3M-luc-C6 cells were used in an orthotopic
xenograft model in male athymic nude mice [NIH Balb/cAn
NCr-nu (nu/nu); 5–6 weeks old]. Surgery was conducted to
expose the prostate, and 20 mL of the tumor cell suspension
(5  105 cells) was injected into the dorsolateral lobe of the
prostate gland. Following closure, mice were treated with
SR48692 (25 mg/kg in PEG800) or vehicle control for 5
consecutive days, according to the schedule described in
the Results section. Drug was administered orally in 0.2 mL
volumes 4 hours prior to radiation treatments. Mice were then
anesthetized with a ketamine/xylazine mix, and a dose of 2.5
Gy X-ray was given to the prostate area while shielding the
body with lead (34). Animals were imaged on a weekly basis by
anesthetizing with isoflurane before and during imaging and
injecting intraperitoneally with luciferin (a substrate for
luciferase) at 150 mg/kg in a volume of 0.1 mL (35). Animals
were imaged at a peak time of 10 to 20 minutes post-luciferin
injection via a Xenogen IVIS instrument, using exposure times
and sensitivity settings to avoid saturation. Image processing
was conducted using Living Image software (Xenogen) by
region-of-interest analysis of total photons/sec for each
tumor, with appropriate background subtraction.

RNA isolation and reverse transcription PCR
Total cellular RNA was isolated from exponentially growing
cells using the RNeasy Kit (Qiagen). Reverse transcription was
carried out with 2 mg of total RNA using iScript reagent (BioRad). The PCR amplification was carried out using 25 pmol of
specific NTR1, NTR2, NTR3, and neurotensin primers as
described elsewhere (ref. 33; NTR1, forward 50 -TCATCGCCTTTGTGGTCTGCT-30 , reverse 50 -TGGTTGCTGGACACGCTGTCG-30 ; NTR2, forward 50 -GTCTCCTCAGCTTCATCGTAT-30 ,
reverse 50 -TCCCCAAAGCCTGAAGCTGTA-30 ; NTR3, forward 50 -AGAATGGTCGAGACTATGTTG-30 , reverse 50 -AAGAGCTATTCCAAGAGGTCC-30 ; and neurotensin, forward 50 ACTTGGCTTGTTAGAAGGC-30 , reverse 50 -TGTGGAGCTGGTATATTGTC-30 ) and JumpStart REDTaq polymerase
mix (Sigma). The thermal profile consisted of initial denaturation at 95 C for 5 minutes, followed by 30 cycles of denaturation at 94 C for 30 seconds, annealing at 62 C for 60
seconds, extension at 72 C for 45 seconds, and by a final
extension at 72 C for 7 minutes. PCR products were resolved
on a 1% agarose gel, stained with SYBR Safe, and quantified
using the ImageJ Program (http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/).
The NTR3-specific product was used to normalize the
signals.

Statistical analysis
All error bars represent the SEM from n ¼ 3 independent
experiments, unless indicated otherwise. P values were calculated using a one-factor ANOVA; values of P < 0.05 were
considered statistically significant.

Caspase activation assay
Cells were plated in 96-well plates (10,000 cells per well),
allowed to attach, treated with SR48692 (1 mmol/L) or sham
treated (equal volume of DMF) for 24 hours, and irradiated
(6 Gy). Following 24 to 48 hours of incubation, the activation of
cellular caspases 3 and 7 was measured by a fluorescencebased assay (Apo-ONE Homogeneous Caspase-3/7 Assay;
Promega). Multiple (6–12) wells per treatment condition were
used to obtain average fluorescence signals and normalized to
sham-treated controls.

SR48692 sensitizes PC-3M prostate cancer cells to
ionizing radiation
We tested the hypothesis that inhibiting the NTR1 receptor,
and therefore its downstream proproliferation and prosurvival
signals, will enhance cell-killing effects of ionizing radiation in
prostate cancer cells. For initial experiments, we chose an
androgen-independent and highly metastatic prostate adenocarcinoma cell line (PC-3M) and a nontumorigenic prostate
epithelial cell line (RWPE-1). Cells were treated with an NTR1
antagonist, SR48692, irradiated, and their colony-forming
(clonogenic) ability assessed. At this concentration, SR48692
significantly (P < 0.01) enhanced radiation effects in PC-3M
cells (Fig. 1A), resulting in a decrease in surviving fraction at 2
Gy (SF2) from 0.575 to 0.331, and a clinically relevant dose
enhancement ratio at 37% survival (DER37) of 1.77. As shown
in Supplementary Fig. S1, SR48692-induced radiosensitization
is dose and time dependent, reaching a maximum at 1 mmol/L
and 24 hours of treatment. Importantly, SR48692 pretreatment
did not sensitize normal epithelial RWPE-1 cells (Fig. 1B).
Prostate cancer cells, but not normal prostate epithelial
cells, express NTR1
The results of Fig. 1A and B showed that SR48692-induced
radiosensitization is specific to prostate cancer cells. Here, we
confirmed that neurotensin receptors (NTR1, NTR2, and
NTR3) are differentially expressed in normal and cancer

prostate cell lines. Fig. 1C shows that NTR1 protein, the
specific target of SR48692, is expressed in PC-3M cells but
not in RWPE-1 cells. Surprisingly, the mRNA for NTR1 was
present in both cell lines (Fig. 1D), although the level in RWPE1 was approximately 50% lower than in PC-3M cells (Fig. 1E).
Both cell lines contained similar levels of mRNA for NTR3
(Fig. 1D, NTR3 lanes) but none for NTR2 (Fig. 1D, NTR2 lanes).
Protein levels of NTR3 and NTR2 correlated with mRNA levels
(data not shown). NTR1 protein was also expressed in LNCaP,
C4-2B, and DU-145 prostate cancer cells at comparable levels
(Supplementary Fig. S3). In addition, PC-3M expressed mRNA
for the neurotensin/neuromedin gene, whereas the neurotensin-specific reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) product was
absent in RWPE-1 (Fig. 1D, neurotensin lanes). This finding
was confirmed using an ELISA assay (Supplementary Fig. S4),
where we detected significant levels of neurotensin in PC-3M
cell culture medium but not in RWPE-1 or LNCaP culture
media. These observations suggest that autocrine stimulation
of prostate cancer cells occurs via endogenously expressed
agonist (neurotensin), which stimulates expressed NTR1.
To validate our hypothesis that the radiosensitizing
effects of SR48692 are mediated through its interactions
with NTR1, we silenced the receptor mRNA expression in
PC-3M cells using SmartPool siRNA (Dharmacon). The
results in Supplementary Fig. S2 show that knocking down

6820

of NTR1 radiosensitized prostate cancer cells (Supplementary Fig. S2B) and reduced cell proliferation (Supplementary
Fig. S2A). Importantly, treatment with SR48692 did not
further increase the radiosensitivity of PC-3M cells with
depleted NTR1 receptor.
SR48692 alone inhibits neurotensin-induced prostate
cancer cell growth
Existing literature suggests that NTR1 stimulation enhances
prostate cancer cell growth, and inhibiting this pathway with
SR48692 reduces cell proliferation. Our results (Fig. 1) show that
SR48692 reduces clonogenic survival of cancer cells exposed to
ionizing radiation; however, our preliminary experiments suggested that the drug alone did not significantly affect cell
survival under similar conditions. Thus, we attempted to
reconcile these observations using PC-3M cells maintained
under different conditions: exponentially growing cells in complete medium (as used in radiosensitization experiments) and
quiescent cells in serum-free medium (as used in stimulation/
proliferation experiments; refs. 15, 22). As shown in Fig. 2A,
neurotensin stimulated proliferation of serum-starved PC-3M
cells, whereas blocking the NTR1 receptor with SR48692 (concomitant with neurotensin stimulation) completely abrogated
this response. Moreover, SR48692 pretreatment diminished
neurotensin-induced EGFR and Src phosphorylation in

Figure 2. Differential effects of NTR1 antagonist in serum-free versus serum-containing medium. A, SR48692 inhibits stimulatory effects of
neurotensin in prostate cancer cells maintained in serum-free medium. PC-3M and RWPE-1 cells were serum starved for 48 hours, pretreated with SR48692
(SR; 1 mmol/L for 24 hours), stimulated with neurotensin (NT; 100 nmol/L for 24 hours) and proteins quantified by sulforhodamine B staining.
Results are normalized to the untreated control, and data points are from 2 to 4 independent experiments (SEM). B, neurotensin-induced EGFR and Src
phosphorylation in serum-starved PC-3M cells. Cells were lysed following 15 to 60 minutes of incubation with neurotensin (100 nmol/L) with or
without SR48692 (1 mmol/L), cellular EGFR was immunoprecipitated (IP), and EGFR phosphorylation was assessed using phosphospecific antibodies (tyrosine
845, pY845; tyrosine 992, pY992). Src phosphorylation (tyrosine 416, pY416) was assessed using straight Western blotting (WB) of protein lysates. Total
EGFR and Src levels were also assessed. C, under similar conditions (serum-free medium), neurotensin (100 nmol/L for 1 hour) does not induce EGFR
phosphorylation in RWPE-1 cells lacking NTR1 receptor. EGF stimulation (100 ng/mL for 5 minutes) was used as a positive control. D, NTR1 antagonist
has a minimal effect on growth and survival of prostate cancer cells maintained in complete growth medium. PC-3M cells were treated with indicated
concentrations of SR48692 for 24 hours and counted (growth) or maintained continuously for 14 days. Established colonies scored (survival). E, SR48692 has
no effect on cell-cycle progression in cells maintained in serum-containing medium. Exponentially growing PC-3M cells were treated with SR48692
(SR; 1 mmol/L for 24 hours), and the cell-cycle distribution was assessed by BrdUrd incorporation and DNA staining. *, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01 denote statistical

epithelial cells did not respond to neurotensin stimulation nor
SR48692 treatment(s) (Fig. 2A and C) most likely because they
do not possess NTR1 receptors (Fig. 1C and D).
Strikingly, PC-3M cells grown in complete medium were
minimally affected by SR48692 treatment. Fig. 2D shows that
SR48692 minimally affected cell growth, and similar negligible
effects were noted in long-term clonogenic survival assays
(14 days colony formation). Even at the highest dose tested
(10 mmol/L), the drug effects did not exceed 30% inhibition. In
agreement with these findings, SR48692 had no effect on

cell-cycle progression of PC-3M cells growing exponentially
in complete medium (Fig. 2E). On the basis of these results,
we can also conclude that observed radiosensitizing activity in
cells growing in complete medium is not due to effects such as
cell-cycle perturbation and/or induction of cell death by the
drug alone.

significant (P < 0.05), although smaller in magnitude than the
decrease in SF2 in PC-3M cells, whereas the DER37 (1.43)
calculated for both cell lines is also smaller than for PC-3M
cells. On the basis of these observations, we hypothesize that
inhibition of NTR1 radiosensitizes prostate cancer cells independently of their androgen receptor and p53 status.

SR48692 affects EGFR phosphorylation in response to
radiation or neurotensin
It is known that radiation induces EGFR phosphorylation
and activates downstream signaling pathways leading to
increased cell survival (36, 37). Therefore, we determined
whether SR48692 pretreatment interferes with radiationand/or neurotensin-induced EGFR phosphorylation. For
short-term studies in complete medium, the SR48692-treated
PC-3M cells were irradiated, incubated for 5 minutes at 37 C,
and lysed in CHAPS buffer. Total cellular EGFR was immunoprecipitated, and Western blotting was carried out using
antibodies against EGFR phosphotyrosine 992 (pY992) and
total phosphotyrosine (pY20). Fig. 4A shows that under these
conditions, radiation induced an increase in EGFR phosphorylation as determined by both pY20 and pY992 phospho-specific
antibodies. SR48692 alone did not affect EGFR phosphorylation
levels; however, it reduced radiation-induced phosphorylation
to 83% (pY992) and 67% (pY20) of initial levels.
Fig. 4B shows a modest increase in the phosphorylation
levels of EGFR (pY845 and pY992) and Src (pY416) in serumstarved PC-3M cells following an extended time course (15–60
minutes) of irradiation alone (X) and significant increase with
combined treatment of radiation plus neurotensin (X þ NT).
The radiation-induced phosphorylation, observed 5 minutes
postirradiation in Fig. 4A, was reduced to almost basal levels
at 15 or 60 minutes following irradiation (Fig. 4B, X). With
combined treatment (Fig. 4B, X þ NT), EGFR and Src phosphorylation reached a maximum at 60 minutes, closely

present in androgen-sensitive prostate cancer cells, we tested
LNCaP and its derivative, C4-2B, in clonogenic survival assays.
Both cell lines express androgen receptor and respond to
androgen stimulation, unlike PC-3M, which is androgen receptor negative and androgen insensitive. The difference
between the two cell lines is that C4-2B can grow in the
absence of androgen, whereas LNCaP growth is androgen
dependent. In addition to androgen receptor status, LNCaP
and C4-2B cell lines also differ significantly from PC-3M in
their p53 status: Both express wild-type protein, whereas PC3M cells are p53 null. As shown in Fig. 3A and B, both cell lines
were sensitized to radiation by pretreatment with SR48692.

Figure 4. SR48692 affects neurotensin- and radiation-induced EGFR phosphorylation. A, PC-3M prostate cancer cells were treated with SR48692
(SR; 1 mmol/L for 24 hours) and/or irradiation (X; 6 Gy), and cellular lysates were prepared after 5 minutes. Total tyrosine (pY20) and EGFR tyrosine 992–specific
(pY992) phosphorylation were assessed in EGFR immunoprecipitates. Fold changes represent the mean of 2 independent experiments, with
phosphospecific signal intensities normalized to total EGFR levels. B, serum-starved PC-3M cells were preincubated with SR48692 (SR; 1 mmol/L for 24
hours), stimulated with neurotensin (NT; 100 nmol/L for 1 hour) as indicated, and irradiated (X; 6 Gy). EGFR phosphorylation (Y845 and Y992), Src
phosphorylation (Y416), and the expression of total EGFR and Src proteins were analyzed by immunoprecipitation and Western blotting.

Figure 5. SR48692 treatment enhances apoptosis in irradiated prostate
cancer cells. A, PC-3M cells were treated with SR48692 (SR; 1 mmol/L for
24 hours) and irradiated (X; 6 Gy), and samples, including floating cells,
were collected at specified times (24, 48, and 72 hours postirradiation). A
representative Western blot analysis shows full-size and cleaved PARP
and phosphorylated (pS2056) DNA-dependent protein kinase after
indicated treatments. b-Actin was used as a loading control. B, caspase
3/7 activity in SR48692-treated (SR; 1 mmol/L for 24 hours) and -irradiated
(X; 6 Gy) PC-3M cells was measured 24 and 48 hours postirradiation as
described in Materials and Methods. Fluorescence signals were
normalized to the fluorescence of sham-treated controls (Ctrl). The results
were obtained in 2 independent experiments (6–12 intraexperimental
replicates). *, P < 0.05.

following the kinetics of phosphorylation induced by neurotensin alone (Fig. 2B). In both cases, pretreatment with
SR48692 completely abrogated this long-term EGFR or Src
phosphorylation (Fig. 4B, SR lanes).
Pretreatment with SR48692 enhances radiationinduced apoptosis in PC-3M cells
Treatment of PC-3M cells with a combination of SR48692
and radiation resulted in a significant increase in apoptosis
within 48 hours, as shown by the enhanced cleavage of PARP
and DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) phospho-S2056
(Fig. 5A, bottom bands). Both proteins are known to be targets
for caspase 3–mediated degradation during apoptosis (38, 39).
Consistent with this observation, there was a statistically
significant (P < 0.05) increase in caspase 3 and 7 activity in
cells treated with combined agents (Fig. 5B, X þ SR) when
compared with radiation-only treatment (Fig. 5B, X). It is
worth to note that, at the dose and times assessed, the drug
alone in the presence of serum did not induce cellular
apoptotic death, in line with our previous results on the
effects of SR48692 on cell growth and cell cycle (Fig. 2D
and E).

Combined treatment of SR48692 with radiation elicits
synergistic antitumor activity against PC-3M tumor
xenografts in mice
The orthotopic PC-3M human prostate cancer model was
used to test the hypothesis that SR48692 can be used as a
radiosensitizing agent in vivo. The schematic outlines of the in
vivo experiments are presented in Fig. 6A and the results in
Fig. 6B and C. In the first experiment, animals (8 per treatment
group) were randomized on day 5 postinoculation, and drug
treatment/irradiation was started immediately thereafter. In
the second experiment, tumor development was monitored by
bioluminescence for 14 to 21 days, and then, the animals with
similar tumor burden were randomized into treatment groups
and treated. Treatment regimen was the same in both experiments and consisted of 5 daily does of SR48692 (25 mg/kg)
followed by 2.5 Gy ionizing radiation on days 3 and 5 (Fig. 6A).
Fig. 6B and C shows the tumor burden (measured as
bioluminescence from PC-3M cells) in animals in experiments
1 and 2, respectively. In both experiments, SR48692 alone (SR)
had no significant effect on tumor progression, whereas
radiation alone (X) was only partially efficacious. However,
the combined treatment (X þ SR) showed the most prominent
effect, significantly reducing tumor growth in the treated
animals (X vs. X þ SR; P < 0.05). This reduction was especially
noticeable when the combined treatment was used on animals
inoculated only 5 days before (Fig. 6B, experiment 1). The
reduced tumor burden was confirmed by visual examination
of excised urogenital tracts (Fig. 6D, representative samples
from experiment 2).

Discussion
On the basis of the incidence of cancer recurrence and
radioresistance, improvements in radiation therapy, in general, and in prostate tumor treatments, in particular, are
urgently needed. In the present study, we show that inhibition
of NTR1 is a novel method for radiosensitization of prostate
cancer. Our results show that combined treatment of SR48692,
a selective inhibitor of NTR1, and ionizing radiation efficiently
kills cancer cells in vitro and significantly lowers tumor burden
in vivo. In addition, combination of NTR1 antagonist and
radiotherapy is effective independent of cancer cell p53 and
androgen receptor status. Most importantly, the combined
treatment provides selectivity between normal and cancer
cells.
The magnitude of sensitization to radiation seen here with
SR48692 in cell lines (Figs. 1 and 3, DER37  1.3–1.8) is lower
than often observed with anticancer drug sensitization. Nevertheless, the differential radiosensitization is significant as
compared with, for example, clinically used and experimental
EGFR targeting sensitizing agents such as erlotinib (40) or
C225 (41, 42). Our in vivo experiments confirm that SR48692
treatment combined with radiation causes significant reduction in tumor growth (Fig. 6).
We postulate that the differential expression of NTR1, its
high expression in prostate cancer cells but not in normal
prostate epithelial cells (Fig. 1), is a major factor in the
selectivity of SR48692-induced radiosensitization. However,

Figure 6. Effects of NTR1 antagonist combined with radiation on the growth of PC-3M orthotopic xenografts in nude mice. A, schematic description
of experiments 1 and 2 as detailed in the Results section. B, experiment 1: 5 days postinoculation mice were randomized, treated with SR48692
(SR; 25 mg/kg) for 5 consecutive days, and irradiated (X; 2.5 Gy delivered to prostate area only) on second and fourth days of treatment. Bioluminescence
imaging was conducted on a weekly basis. Data points represent means from 8 animals in the group (SEM). *, P < 0.05 compared with radiation only
(one-factor ANOVA). C, experiment 2: the presence and size of tumors were assessed 2 weeks postinoculation, and the mice were randomized into 4 treatment
groups. Treatment was conducted during week 4 (as described for A). D, representative images (from C) of the urogenital system in nontreated (normal), PC3M inoculated (Ctrl), and treated (X and XþSR) mice. Samples were collected from mice euthanized 50 to 70 days postgrafting.

there are at least 3 different neurotensin receptors (NTR1,
NTR2, and NTR3; ref. 43), therefore, one may ask whether
SR48692-induced radiosensitization is related to the inhibition
of NTR2 and/or NTR3. In support of our hypothesis, SR48692
has been shown to have a high selectivity for NTR1 and does
not interact strongly with NTR2 or NTR3 (44, 45) or other
unrelated receptors (44). In addition, the literature (33) and
our results (Fig. 1D) show that NTR2 is not expressed in most
prostate cells (including cell lines used in this study). The case
of NTR3 is more complicated—this receptor is ubiquitously
expressed throughout the human body and highly expressed
in the studied cell lines (Fig. 1D). However, its activation is not
likely blocked by SR48692 treatments, as there are 2 orders of
magnitude difference in Kd for binding to NTR1 and NTR3 (45,
46). NTR3 has been shown to cooperate with NTR1 in transducing the neurotensin signal (33, 45). Therefore, it is not very
probable, although still possible, that SR-induced radiosensitization is a result of blocking neurotensin binding/stimulation of NTR3 receptor. However, the requirement of NTR1 in
SR48692-induced radiosensitivity was confirmed using siRNAmediated silencing of the receptor (Supplementary Fig. S2). On
the basis of these considerations, we believe that the observed
radiosensitizing effect is due predominantly to the inhibition
of NTR1.
In addition to the differences in NTR1 expression, the
differences in neurotensin secretion could contribute to

6824

Cancer Res; 71(21) November 1, 2011

cancer selectivity of SR48692 combined with radiation. Our
results (Fig. 1D and Supplementary Fig. S4B) show that PC-3M
cancer cells express and secrete neurotensin, whereas normal
prostate cells do not. The autocrine loop in cells expressing
both the receptor (NTR1) and its agonist (neurotensin) could
significantly enhance survival after irradiation, and disruption
with SR48692 should result in radiosensitivity. It has been
reported that abdominal irradiation increases neurotensin
secretion in rat ileum (47). Although we did not observe
similar effects in cell culture, it is plausible that it can occur
in vivo during prostate radiotherapy.
Several possible mechanisms of NTR1-dependent radiosensitization could be operative, including, but not limited
to, the disruption of cell-cycle progression, inhibition of DNA
damage signaling and/or repair, and enhancement of apoptotic responses. Our results (Fig. 2B) clearly show that SR48692
has no effect on cell cycle of cancer cells growing in complete
medium, whereas under these conditions, radiosensitization
is observed. This rules out the cell-cycle perturbation as a
major factor in sensitization. Even though SR48692 has only
a minimal effect on PC-3M cell growth in complete medium, it
can completely block neurotensin-induced EGFR and Src
phosphorylation (Fig. 4A) and significantly lower radiationinduced EGFR phosphorylation (Fig. 4A). It is known that
neurotensin functions as a prosurvival and mitogenic stimulus
in cancer cells, operating mostly through EGF receptor

transactivation (15, 29). It has also been shown that AKT acts
downstream of EGFR (48) as an important prosurvival and
antiapoptotic factor in response to ionizing radiation (49, 50).
Reducing the threshold to undergo apoptosis by interference
with apoptosis resistance pathways would be expected to
sensitize tumor cells to ionizing radiation by conditioning
them to induction of cell death. Our results support the
hypothesis that NTR1 inhibition lowers, or completely abrogates, EGFR phosphorylation (Fig. 4), which results in an
increase in apoptosis following irradiation (Fig. 5). Interestingly, it has been reported that neurotensin acts as an antiapoptotic factor, protecting serum-starved breast cancer cells
from apoptosis in vitro (51). It is possible that a similar
mechanism is involved in prostate cancer cell resistance to
radiation-induced apoptosis and that blocking NTR1 abrogates the effects of neurotensin. Additional studies are underway to delineate the molecular mechanism(s) responsible
for the induction of apoptosis by treatment with SR48692
combined with radiation.
Previous reports have shown that SR48692 inhibits DNA
synthesis and proliferation in serum-starved (quiescent) and
neurotensin-stimulated PC-3 cells (15, 22). We have confirmed
it here and showed that the drug has a minimal effect on
cancer cells growing in complete medium with 10% FBS
(Fig. 2). Only when combined with ionizing radiation,
SR48692 activity became apparent and biologically significant.
These results could also explain the failure of SR48692 in a
single-agent clinical trial in patients with lung cancer.
Although SR48692 has been shown to inhibit proliferation
in vitro and tumor growth in vivo of small-cell lung cancer (30),
it did not show significant activity in the clinical trial
(NCT0029095). Our observation could also provide a biological
basis for an additional mode of cancer-selective radiosensitization in clinical practice. A systemic treatment with nontoxic
doses of SR48692, together with spatially targeted delivery of
radiotherapy to the particular tumor site, could result in
minimal side effects and sparing of the surrounding normal
tissue. This, combined with the specificity afforded by the
differences in NTR1 expression between normal and cancer
cells, would significantly improve the therapeutic index of
prostate tumor radiotherapy.
Recently, several groups have reported on the involvement
of NTR1 receptor expression and neurotensin stimulation in
the proliferation of various cancer cell lines and aggres-

siveness of tumors in humans (13, 14, 16–19, 21, 26–28, 30).
We hypothesize that the molecular mechanism of cancerselective radiosensitization induced by SR48692 could be
similar in different cell/cancer types and mostly based on
differential NTR1 expression and its connection to prosurvival and antiapoptotic pathways through EGFR and mitogen–activated protein kinase signaling. Therefore, a
combined therapy, as proposed here for prostate tumors,
should be applicable to other cancers that express NTR1
receptor.
In summary, we have showed that SR48692 radiosensitizes
prostate cancer cells in vitro, enhances radiation-induced
apoptosis, and that a decrease in EGFR phosphorylation
and signaling may be involved in this effect. As a whole,
the data suggest the existence of a cross-talk between EGFR
and NTR1 and, possibly, a method for prostate cancer to
modulate responses to radiotherapy. Most importantly, the in
vivo administration of SR48692 prior to radiotherapy resulted
in a significantly improved tumor response compared with the
individual agents in human prostate cancer orthotopic xenografts. The results presented here propose that targeting NTR1
receptor with a selective antagonist, such as SR48692, represents a promising new therapeutic strategy for radiosensitization of prostate tumors.
