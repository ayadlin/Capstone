Abstract
The T-cell–mediated antitumor immune response is frequently repressed in the tumor environment by an immunologic
barrier, the predominant mediators of which are thought to
be interleukin-10 (IL-10) and transforming growth factor-B
(TGF-B). We explored the effect of these cytokines on the
individual T-cell effector functions on antigen engagement
during an antitumor cell attack. Isolated CD4+ and CD8+ T
cells were antigen-specifically redirected toward carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA)-positive tumor cells by expression of a
recombinant T-cell receptor (immunoreceptor), which triggers T-cell activation via CD3Z on binding to CEA. Immunoreceptor-activated T cells secrete IFN-;, proliferate, and lyse
CEA+ but not CEA tumor cells. Whereas IL-10 has no direct
effect on immunoreceptor-triggered effector functions, TGF-B
represses proliferation of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells but
neither IFN-; secretion nor specific cytolytic activities. CD28
costimulation, however, overcomes TGF-B–mediated repression in T-cell proliferation. Consequently, T cells redirected by
a combined CD28-CD3Z signaling immunoreceptor are largely
resistant to TGF-B–mediated repression. This is reflected
in vivo by a more pronounced antitumor activity of T cells
against TGF-B–secreting tumors when redirected by a
costimulatory CD28-CD3Z than by a CD3Z signaling immunoreceptor. [Cancer Res 2007;67(5):2265–73]

Introduction
Tumor antigen-specific cytotoxic T cells frequently infiltrate the
tumor tissue but, although in some tumors in large numbers,
without signs of tumor destruction. Several lines of evidence
sustain the concept that a growing tumor is building up an
immunosuppressive environment in a direct way by secreting
suppressive cytokines that act on immunologic effector cells as
well as indirectly by inducing regulatory T cells that locally repress
an antitumor T-cell attack (1). The immunologic barriers protecting the tumor, however, are thus far not understood in detail.
Interleukin (IL)-10 and transforming growth factor-h (TGF-h)
produced by tumor cells themselves and/or by infiltrating
regulatory T cells are thought to be the major immunosuppressive
cytokines accumulating to high concentrations in the tumor
environment (2). IL-10 represses multiple immune responses
through individual actions on T and B cells, antigen-presenting
cells (APC), and other cell types and skews the immune response

from Th1 to Th2 (3). T-cell stimulation in vitro in the presence of
IL-10 leads to long-term anergy and to the generation of negative
regulatory T-cell subsets.
A variety of tumors, including gastrointestinal, lung, and
mammary carcinomas, highly express TGF-h, thereby triggering
tumor progression by loss of growth-inhibitory control and increase
in metastatic potential and repressing a specific antitumor immune
attack. Whereas the effects of TGF-h on the tumor cells themselves
are well documented, the effects on effector immune cells have only
recently been appreciated (4, 5). TGF-h limits the effector functions
of a variety of immune cells, including tumor antigen-specific
cytotoxic T cells and natural and lymphocyte-activated killer cells
(2, 6). TGF-h controls T-cell homeostasis by inhibiting T-cell
proliferation and activation as well as by inhibiting presentation of
antigens on APCs (7). Various mouse tumor models showed that
production or activation of TGF-h is one of the most potent
mechanisms of tumor cells to prevent elimination by effector
immune cells (8, 9). Inhibition of TGF-h signaling in CD8+ T cells
may restore tumor immunity because adoptively transferred CD8+ T
cells that are made resistant to TGF-h by expression of a dominantnegative TGF-h receptor transgene eliminate efficiently tumor
burden (10, 11). Whereas TGF-h–mediated immune suppression in
the mouse system was most recently characterized in detail (4), little
is known about TGF-h–mediated targeting of human T-cell effector
functions during a tumor antigen-specific immune response.
We therefore asked whether IL-10 and TGF-h act directly and/or
cooperatively on the initiation of antigen-triggered effector
functions of human T cells. To address this issue in a stringently
controlled system, we redirected human CD4+ and CD8+ T cells
antigen specifically toward tumor cells by expression of a
recombinant immunoreceptor that conveys binding specificity for
carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and intracellular CD3~ signaling
(12). Because CEA binding is mediated by an antibody-derived
single-chain Fv (scFv) domain, T-cell activation is triggered
independently of MHC, which allows to monitor both CD4+ and
CD8+ T-cell activation on binding to the same antigen. Immunoreceptor-triggered T-cell activation is indicated by induction of
proliferation, secretion of IFN-g, and specific lysis of CEA+, but not
of CEA, tumor cells (12). By means of thoroughly defined, antigenspecific, T-cell targeting, we here show that TGF-h does not directly
suppress the T-cell immune response but indirectly by repressing
T-cell proliferation. TGF-h–mediated repression of T-cell amplification can be overcome by CD28 costimulation, implying combined
CD28-CD3~ signaling of engineered T cells to break the immunologic barrier of tumor tissues.

directed against the anti-CEA scFv BW431/26 (15). All cell lines were
cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% (v/v) FCS (Life Technologies,
Paisley, United Kingdom). CD1 nu/nu mice were purchased from Charles
River Laboratories (Sulzfeld, Germany). OKT3, 15E8, and BW2064/36 mAbs
were affinity purified from hybridoma supernatants using goat anti-mouse
IgG1 antibody (Southern Biotechnology, Birmingham, AL) that were
immobilized on N -hydroxysuccinimide ester–activated Sepharose as
recommended by the manufacturer (Amersham Biosciences, Freiburg,
Germany). The phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated and FITC-conjugated antiCD3, anti-CD4, and anti-CD8 mAbs were purchased from DAKO (Hamburg,
Germany). The goat anti-human IgG antibody and its biotin-, FITC-, and PEconjugated F(ab¶)2 fragment derivatives were purchased from Southern
Biotechnology. The anti-human IFN-g mAb NIB42 and the biotinylated
anti-human IFN-g mAb 4S.B3 were purchased from BD Biosciences (San
Diego, CA). Purified CEA was purchased from Calbiotech (Spring Valley,
CA), and bovine submaxillary mucin was from Sigma (Deisenhofen,
Germany). Recombinant human IL-2 (Proleukin) was purchased from
Chiron GmbH (Ratingen, Germany), recombinant human IL-10 was from
ImmunoTools (Friesoythe, Germany), and recombinant TGF-h was from Cell
Concepts (Umkirch, Germany). TGF-h bioactivity was monitored by specific
lysis of TGF-h–sensitive Mv-1-Lu (16) and A375 cells (17).
Magnetic-activated cell sorting. Peripheral blood lymphocytes from
healthy donors were isolated by density centrifugation, and monocytes
were depleted by plastic adherence. Nonadherent lymphocytes were
washed with cold PBS containing 0.5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, 1%
(v/v) FCS, and 2 mmol/L EDTA. CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were isolated by
magnetic-activated cell sorting using human CD4+ and CD8+ microbeads,
respectively (Miltenyi, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany). The number of
contaminating cells in the isolated CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell populations
was <2%.
Generation of chimeric receptors and transduction of T cells. The
generation of the retroviral expression cassettes for the CEA-specific
immunoreceptors BW431/26scFv-Fc-CD3~ (#439), BW431/26scFv-Fc-CD28CD3~ (#607), and HRS3scFv-Fc-CD3~ (#523) has been recently described in
detail (18). T cells were retrovirally transduced to express the recombinant
receptor as described earlier (19). Briefly, retroviral vector DNA was
cotransfected with the helper plasmid DNAs pHIT60 and pCOLT (each at
1 Ag DNA/1  105 cells; ref. 13) into 293T cells for virus production. Isolated
CD4+ and CD8+ T cells from the peripheral blood were activated by addition
of IL-2 (1,000 units/mL) and OKT3 mAb (100 ng/mL) for 48 h, washed,
resuspended in RPMI 1640 with IL-2 (1,000 units/mL), and cocultivated for
48 h with transfected 293T cells. T cells were harvested and receptor
expression was monitored by flow cytometry using a PE-conjugated F(ab¶)2
anti-human IgG1 antibody (1 Ag/mL) and a FITC-conjugated anti-CD3 mAb
(UCHT-1, 1:20) and analyzed using a FACSCanto cytofluorometer equipped
with the FACSDiva software (Becton Dickinson, Mountain View, CA).
Receptor-mediated activation of grafted T cells. T cells were grafted
with the recombinant anti-CEA immunoreceptors, cultivated in RPMI 1640
supplemented with 10% (v/v) FCS, without stimuli for 24 h, washed, and
cocultivated with tumor cells (2.5  104 per well) for 48 h in 96-well roundbottomed plates. Culture supernatants were analyzed for secretion of IFN-g
by ELISA using matched pairs of antibodies specific for IFN-g (clones

NIB42 and B133.5; BD Biosciences). Briefly, IFN-g in the supernatant was
bound to a solid-phase anti-human IFN-g mAb (1 Ag/mL) and detected by
a biotinylated anti-human IFN-g mAb (0.5 Ag/mL). The reaction product
was visualized by a peroxidase-streptavidin conjugate (1:10,000) and ABTS
(both purchased from Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) as
substrate. The detection limit of the assay is 15 pg/mL IFN-g. To monitor
the cytolytic activity, CD4+ T cells (104 receptor-grafted cells per well) and
CD8+ T cells (5  103 receptor-grafted cells per well) were cocultivated with
tumor cells (2.5  104 per well) for 48 h in 96-well round-bottomed plates.
T cells have been preincubated with IL-2, IL-10, or TGF-h 12 to 48 h before
the addition of target cells.
Specific cytotoxicity of receptor-grafted T cells was monitored by a
2,3-bis[2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl]-2H-tetrazolium-5-carboxanilide
inner salt (XTT)-based colorimetric assay (20). Briefly, XTT reagent (1 mg/
mL; Cell Proliferation Kit II, Roche Diagnostics) was added to the cells and
incubated for 30 to 90 min at 37jC. Reduction of XTT to formazan by viable
tumor cells was monitored colorimetrically. Maximal reduction of XTT was
determined as the mean of six wells containing tumor cells only and the
background as the mean of six wells containing RPMI 1640 supplemented
with 10% (v/v) FCS. The nonspecific formation of formazan due to the
presence of effector cells was determined from triplicate wells containing
effector cells in the same number as in the corresponding experimental
wells. The number of viable tumor cells was calculated as follows:

5-Carboxylfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester labeling. T cells
(1  107/mL) with and without grafted immunoreceptor were labeled with
5-carboxylfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFSE; 1.25 Amol/L;
Molecular Probes, Göttingen, Germany) in PBS supplemented with 0.1%
(v/v) FCS on ice for 5 min. Cells were washed in cold RPMI 1640
supplemented with 10% (v/v) FCS and incubated in cold medium for
10 min at room temperature. Finally, cells were washed thrice in RPMI 1640
supplemented with 10% (v/v) FCS, incubated for 24 h at 37jC, and washed
once again. CFSE-labeled CD4+ T cells (1  104 per well) and CD8+ T cells
(5  103 per well) were incubated in microtiter plates precoated with the
anti-idiotypic mAb BW2064/36 (15) directed against BW431/26scFv, which
is the binding domain of the anti-CEA immunoreceptors BW431/26scFv-FcCD3~ (#439) and BW431/26scFv-Fc-CD28-CD3~ (#607), or mouse IgG1 as
control (coating concentration, 5 Ag/mL). Cells were incubated with or
without TGF-h (10 ng/mL), IL-10 (10 ng/mL), and IL-2 (1,000 units/mL).
After 6 days, cells were recovered and the number of cycling, CFSE-labeled
cells was determined by flow cytometry.
Immunofluorescence analyses. To monitor granzyme expression,
T cells were fixed and permeabilized using Cytofix/Cytoperm Fixation/
Permeabilization kit (BD Biosciences) and stained with a PE-conjugated
anti-granzyme A antibody, a mouse PE-conjugated IgG1 isotype antibody
(BD PharMingen, San Diego, CA), or a PE-conjugated anti-granzyme B
antibody (Serotec, Oxford, United Kingdom). Cells were analyzed by flow
cytometry, and the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) was determined.
Treatment of CD1 nu/nu mice. To test for in vivo activity of redirected
T cells, CEA+ C15A3 tumor cells that secrete TGF-h were coinjected (5 
105 per mouse) together with T cells without or equipped either with the
CD3~ chain receptor #439 or alternatively with the combined CD28-CD3~
signaling receptor #607 (5  105 T cells per mouse) into CD1 nu/nu mice
(six mice per group).

Results
We monitored the effect of TGF-h and IL-10 on the efficiency of
specific activation of human CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Therefore,
CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were isolated from the peripheral blood of
healthy donors and grafted with specificity for CEA by expression of
the recombinant immunoreceptor BW431/26scFv-Fc-CD3~ (#439)
or alternatively the BW431/26scFv-Fc-CD28-CD3~ (#607). The

immunoreceptors harbor extracellularly the BW431/26 scFv
domain for MHC-independent binding to CEA and intracellularly
the CD3~ or the combined CD28-CD3~ signaling domain for T-cell
activation. Both CD4+ and CD8+ human T cells expressed the
recombinant immunoreceptors with high efficiency (Fig. 1).
Receptor-grafted T cells were specifically activated by coincubation
with CEA+ LS174T tumor cells in a dose-dependent fashion indicated by an increase in IFN-g secretion and decrease in viability of
CEA+ LS174T cells showing the cytolytic activity of redirected
T cells (Fig. 2A). T-cell activation is mediated via the recombinant
immunoreceptor because T cells grafted with the anti-CEA immunoreceptor were not activated in the presence of CEA Colo320
cells and T cells without immunoreceptor were activated in the
presence of neither CEA+ LS174T nor CEA Colo320 cells. For
comparison, T cells were grafted with the anti-CD30 immunoreceptor HRS3scFv-Fc-CD3~ (#523), which harbors the anti-CD30
scFv domain instead of the anti-CEA scFv domain BW431/26.
T cells with the anti-CD30 immunoreceptor #523 are activated toward CD30+ MyLa cells but not against CEA+ LS174T cells, whereas
T cells with anti-CEA immunoreceptor #439 are activated against
CEA+ LS174T cells but not against CD30+ MyLa cells (Fig. 2B).
Using this assay system, we explored whether added cytokines
IL-10, TGF-h, and, for comparison, IL-2 modulate the efficiency of
antigen-triggered T-cell effector functions. Addition of IL-10
substantially increased receptor-triggered IFN-g secretion by
CD8+ T cells and, to lower amounts, by CD4+ T cells in the
presence of CEA+ LS174T cells. TGF-h, noteworthy, did not alter
the amount of secreted IFN-g under these stimulatory conditions
(Fig. 3A and B). TGF-h used in these assays is biologically active
as it suppressed proliferation of TGF-h–sensitive Mv-1-Lu and
A375 cells (data not shown). As controls, T cells without
recombinant immunoreceptor and coincubated with LS174T cells
did not increase IFN-g secretion nor did receptor-grafted T cells
coincubated with CEA Colo320 cells in the presence of neither
IL-10 nor TGF-h (data not shown). For comparison, addition of
IL-2 furthermore increased in a dose-dependent manner IFN-g
secretion by receptor-grafted CD4+ and CD8+ T cells when
coincubated with CEA+ LS174T cells. The effect is restricted to
immunoreceptor-mediated T-cell activation and not due to an

unspecific T-cell activation because (a) addition of IL-2 to T cells
without immunoreceptor and (b) coincubation with CEA
Colo320 in the presence of IL-2 did not induce IFN-g secretion
(Fig. 3C).
We now asked whether added cytokines act on receptortriggered cytolytic activities of T cells. Therefore, CD8+ T cells
were grafted with the BW431/26scFv-Fc-CD3~ immunoreceptor
and coincubated with CEA+ LS174T in the presence of IL-2, IL-10,
and TGF-h. As summarized in Fig. 3D, the CEA-specific cytolytic
activity of receptor-grafted CD8+ T cells toward CEA+ LS174T cells
was not significantly altered in the presence of TGF-h. IL-10
slightly increased the antigen-specific cytolytic activity of CD8+
T cells, whereas IL-2 unspecifically increased the cytolytic activity
of both receptor-grafted and nongrafted T cells.
To explore whether B7-CD28 costimulation has an effect on the
TGF-h effect on redirected T cells, we used LS174T-B7 cells as
target cells that express both B7-1 and B7-2 on the cell surface on
transfection (14). Again, TGF-h did not inhibit the cytolytic activity
of receptor-grafted T cells (Fig. 3E). Consequently, T cells redirected
by the immunoreceptor BW431/26scFv-Fc-CD28-CD3~ (#607) that
harbors the costimulatory CD28 domain together with the CD3~
domain are not inhibited in their lytic activity in the presence of
TGF-h. Lysis is specific as CEA Colo320 cells were not lysed by
T cells with an anti-CEA immunoreceptor, and T cells grafted with
a receptor of irrelevant binding specificity [i.e., the anti-CD30
receptor HRS3scFv-Fc-CD3~ (#523)] did not lyse CEA+ tumor cells
(Fig. 3E).
Using cross-titrations, we explored whether IL-10 and TGF-h act
in concert on IFN-g secretion and/or cytolytic activity of redirected
T cells. Neither IFN-g secretion nor specific cytolytic activity of
CD4+ and CD8+ T cells was substantially altered on receptor
triggering in the presence of both IL-10 and TGF-h (data not shown).
To monitor the effect of added cytokines on receptor-triggered
proliferation, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells with and without BW431/
26scFv-Fc-CD3~ immunoreceptor were incubated with the immobilized anti-idiotypic mAb BW2064/36, which is directed against
the CEA-binding domain BW431/26scFv of the immunoreceptor.
An immobilized, isotype-matched mAb served as control. Receptorgrafted CD8+ as well as CD4+ T cells increased proliferation on

respectively, as described in Materials and
Methods. To monitor receptor expression,
T cells were simultaneously incubated with
a PE-conjugated anti-human IgG1 mAb
that binds to the extracellular spacer region
of the immunoreceptor and with a
FITC-conjugated anti-CD3 mAb and
analyzed by flow cytometry.

Figure 2. CD4+ and CD8+ T cells are antigen-specifically
triggered via the recombinant immunoreceptor. A, isolated
CD4+ and CD8+ T cells with and without the CEA-specific

coincubated in increasing numbers with CEA+ LS174T and
CEA Colo320 tumor cells (each at 2.5  104 per well),
respectively. B, CD3+ T cells were grafted with the
CEA-specific BW431/26scFv-Fc-CD3~ (#439) and the
CD30-specific HRS3scFv-Fc-CD3~ (#523) immunoreceptor
and coincubated with CEA+ LS174T and CD30+ MyLa cells

was monitored by ELISA.

specific triggering in contrast to T cells without immunoreceptor
(Fig. 4A). Addition of TGF-h repressed immunoreceptor-triggered
proliferation of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, whereas IL-10 did not
alter receptor-triggered proliferation. As expected, addition of IL-2
furthermore increased proliferation of immunoreceptor-grafted T
cells independently of immunoreceptor triggering. Activation by
the anti-idiotypic mAb BW2064/36 is specific for immunoreceptors
with the BW431/26 scFv domain because T cells grafted with an
irrelevant receptor are not stimulated by mAb BW2064/36 (data
not shown).

To explore whether CD28 costimulation can counteract TGF-h–
mediated repression in proliferation, we incubated BW431/
26scFv-Fc-CD3~ (#439) receptor-grafted T cells on plates coated
with the anti-idiotypic mAb BW2064/36 as antigen together with
the agonistic anti-CD28 antibody 15E8. As summarized in Fig. 4B,
CD28 costimulation partly overcomes TGF-h–mediated repression
in proliferation of receptor-grafted T cells on antigen encounter.
We therefore asked whether triggering by an immunoreceptor that
harbors the costimulatory CD28 in addition to the CD3~ signaling
domain makes T-cell proliferation less sensitive to the repressive

Figure 3. IL-10 and TGF-h act differentially on effector functions of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells redirected by a recombinant immunoreceptor. Isolated CD4+ and
CD8+ T cells were retrovirally transduced to express the CEA-specific immunoreceptor BW431/26scFv-Fc-CD3~ (#439). Receptor-grafted as well as nonmodified
T cells (5  103 receptor-grafted CD8+ T cells per well; 104 receptor-grafted CD4+ T cells per well) were coincubated for 48 h with CEA+ LS174T or CEA Colo320 cells
(each at 2.5  104 per well), respectively, in the presence of increasing amounts of IL-10 (A), TGF-h (B ), and IL-2 (C ). IFN-g in the culture supernatant was
monitored by ELISA. D, isolated CD8+ T cells were grafted by retroviral gene transfer with the CEA-specific immunoreceptor #439 and coincubated (5  103
receptor-expressing T cells per well) with CEA+ LS174T or CEA Colo320 cells (each at 2.5  104 per well), respectively, in the presence of IL-2 (1,000 units/mL),
IL-10 (10 ng/mL), or TGF-h (10 ng/mL) for 48 h. Essentially the same results were obtained after 4 d of coincubation. E, T cells were grafted with the CEA-specific
immunoreceptors BW431/26scFv-Fc-CD3~ (#439) and BW431/26scFv-Fc-CD28-CD3~ (#607) and with the CD30-specific immunoreceptor HRS3scFv-Fc-CD3~

and CEA Colo320 cells (each at 2.5  104 per well), respectively, in the presence or absence of TGF-h (10 ng/mL) for 48 h. Viability of the tumor cells was monitored

effect of TGF-h. CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were grafted either with the
CD3~ signaling immunoreceptor #439 or alternatively with the
costimulatory CD28-CD3~ immunoreceptor #607 and stimulated
via immunoreceptor by incubation with the immobilized antiidiotypic mAb BW2064/36. In the presence of TGF-h, proliferation
of T cells equipped with the costimulatory CD28-CD3~ receptor
#607 was far less repressed than of T cells equipped with the CD3~
signaling #439 receptor (Fig. 4C). Taken together, the data clearly
indicate that TGF-h–mediated repression in proliferation of
redirected T cells can be overcome by combined CD28-CD3~
signaling as provided by the immunoreceptor #607.
We monitored the expression of the cytolytic effector molecules
granzyme A and B because they represent the major effector
molecules by which redirected T cells lyse their target cells (21–23).
T cells grafted with the combined CD28-CD3~ signaling receptor
#607 harbor increased levels of both granzyme A and B compared
with T cells grafted with the CD3~ signaling receptor #439 (Fig. 5).

Incubation of CD8+ T cells in the presence of TGF-h did not alter
substantially the levels of granzyme B expression. This is shown for
T cells with the CD3~ and CD28-CD3~ signaling immunoreceptor.
TGF-h decreases the level of granzyme A in T cells with #607
receptor, however, to levels that are as high as in T cells with or
without the #439 receptor. For comparison, IL-2 increased
granzyme B expression in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells with and without
immunoreceptor. Taken together, the expression levels of granzyme B, which is predominantly involved in mediating cytolytic
activities of redirected T cells, are not substantially altered in the
presence of TGF-h, reflecting their retained cytolytic activity.
We asked whether T cells grafted with the CD28-CD3~ costimulatory immunoreceptor are more potent toward a TGF-h–secreting
tumor than T cells with a CD3~ signaling immunoreceptor. Therefore, we coinjected CEA+, TGF-h–secreting C15A3 tumor cells
together with T cells equipped either with the CD3~ chain receptor
#439 or alternatively with the combined CD28-CD3~ signaling

TGF-b Represses Proliferation of Redirected T Cells

receptor #607 into CD1 nu/nu mice. Mice that received T cells with
the CD3~ signaling receptor developed more frequently a tumor
compared with mice receiving T cells with the costimulatory CD28CD3~ receptor (Fig. 6), indicating a stronger antitumor activity of
the costimulatory receptor toward TGF-h–secreting tumor cells
than the CD3~ signaling receptor. As control, T cells without
immunoreceptor had minor effects on tumor growth in vivo. Taken
together, the mouse model sustains our conclusion that T cells
redirected by a costimulatory CD28-CD3~ immunoreceptor are
more effective toward a TGF-h–secreting tumor than T cells
redirected by a CD3~ signaling receptor.

Discussion
We here characterized the effect of the immunosuppressive
cytokines IL-10 and TGF-h on the execution of effector functions of
human engineered CD4+ and CD8+ T cells that are redirected in an
antigen-specific fashion toward CEA+ tumor cells. Because the
recombinant immunoreceptor binds antigen via a scFv antibody
and thus independently of MHC presentation, CD4+ as well as CD8+
T cells are activated by the same immunoreceptor toward the same
antigen. Our main observations are that IL-10, at least in those
concentrations tested, increased IFN-g secretion but did not alter
proliferation or specific cytolytic activities of activated CD4+ and
CD8+ T cells when stimulated via a strong CD3~ signaling
immunoreceptor. TGF-h, in contrast, did not substantially alter
IFN-g secretion and cytolytic activities but repressed induction of
proliferation of redirected T cells. This implies a more specific
mechanism by which TGF-h acts on activated T cells than by an
overall repression of T-cell effector functions. Whereas numerous
studies show that TGF-h is essential to maintain T-cell homeostasis,
the mechanisms by which TGF-h regulates T-cell expansion remain
poorly understood in detail. Several lines of evidence imply that

TGF-h signals through multiple pathways and multiple intracellular
effector molecules to inhibit proliferation of activated T cells. One of
the intracellular effector molecules, Smad3, was shown to be
essential to repress T-cell receptor (TCR)/CD3-induced proliferation (24). TGF-h moreover suppresses the steady-state level of IL-2
on TCR/CD28 signaling in a Smad3-dependent manner. IL-2–
dependent T-cell proliferation, however, is repressed by TGF-h
through a Smad3-independent pathway. On the other hand, TGF-h
cooperates with TCR signaling to increase IL-2 receptor a-chain
expression (25). Our data on redirected human T cells are partly in
contrast to recent results reported for murine T cells (4). In the
murine system, TGF-h directly represses the expression of IFN-g
as well as of perforin, granzyme A and B, and Fas, resulting in
suppressed cytotoxicity of CD8+ T cells. The latter is independent of
growth inhibition by TGF-h. The difference to our observations on
human T cells may be attributed to the fact that we used strongly
preactivated T cells in contrast to naive T cells to allow retroviral
transduction and immunoreceptor expression.
Our second major observation is that CD28 costimulation
reduces the repressive effect of TGF-h on redirected CD4+ as well
as CD8+ T cells. The costimulatory signal can be combined with the
primary signal into one combined signaling immunoreceptor,
providing a strong CD28 signal simultaneously to the CD3~ signal.
Gunnlaugsdottir et al. (26) reported that only T cells receiving strong
CD3 stimulation become less responsive toward TGF-h in the
presence of CD28 costimulation, indicating that the result of CD28
counteraction depends on the avidity of the TCR/CD3 signal. In that
report, naive cord blood cells were used in contrast to activated T
cells we used in this study. In the situation of signaling through
recombinant immunoreceptors, moreover, T cells bind antigen with
high affinity via an antibody-derived binding domain compared with
low-avidity interactions of the physiologic TCR/CD3 complex. In
this context, our results are in accordance to those reported by

promoter, thereby repressing IL-2 transcription. This mechanism,
however, does not explain how TGF-h inhibits proliferation and how
it is counteracted by strong CD28 signaling. Because Tob shares
other inhibitory functions of TGF-h, some of the additional effects
may result from a cross-talk between TGF-h and Tob. Moreover,
CD8+ T cells express lower amounts of Tob than CD4+ T cells,
making them less responsive to CD28 costimulation (27). In our
study, however, we found activated CD4+ and CD8+ T cells
responding nearly similar to CD28 costimulation. In contrast to
activated human T cells analyzed here, in murine naive CD4+ T cells,
TGF-h was reported to inhibit proliferation and IL-2 secretion on
CD3 stimulation, whereas CD28 costimulation enhanced proliferation while still repressing IL-2 secretion (28). Taken together, there
obviously exists a regulatory system where CD28 costimulation can
counteract TGF-h–mediated repression of T-cell proliferation. In
the physiologic situation, the strength of the CD28 signal may
differentiate between weak and nonspecific stimuli versus strong
and specific stimuli, resulting in no or successful counteraction of
TGF-h–mediated repression, respectively. In the situation of
engineered, activated T cells redirected by high-affinity immunoreceptors that provide a strong costimulatory signal, TGF-h–
mediated repression in proliferation is successfully counteracted by
CD28 signaling.
Results presented here have major implications for the design of
redirected T cells that enter the immunosuppressive environment
of tumors. Although there seems to be no direct effect on cytolytic
activities, T cells activated via a low-avidity TCR/CD3~ signal alone
are likely to be repressed by TGF-h in proliferation. This effect,
however, will indirectly result in repression of the antitumor
immune response. To overcome the TGF-h–mediated repression in
proliferation, we therefore suggest to provide a strong CD28
costimulus simultaneously with the TCR/CD3~ signal to redirected
effector T cells.

stronger antitumor activity than the CD3~ signaling receptor #439 toward

coinjected with or without the same number of CD3+ T cells into CD1 nu/nu
mice (5  105 per mouse; six mice per group) without or equipped either with
the BW431/26scFv-Fc-CD3~ (#439) or alternatively with the BW431/26scFvFc-CD28-CD3~ (#607) immunoreceptor. Tumor growth was monitored every
2 d. Mice with a lesion <100 mm3 were taken tumor-free.
