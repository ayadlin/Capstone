Abstract
We investigated the role of macrophages in promoting benzopyrene (BaP)induced malignant transformation of human bronchial epithelial cells using a BaPinduced tumor transformation model with a bionic airway chip in vitro and in animal
models. The bionic airway chip culture data showed that macrophages promoted
BaP-induced malignant transformation of human bronchial epithelial cells, which was
mediated by nuclear factor (NF)-κB and STAT3 pathways to induce cell proliferation,
colony formation in chip culture, and tumorigenicity in nude mice. Blockage of
interleukin (IL)-6 or tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α signaling or inhibition of NF-κB,
STAT3, or cyclinD1 expression abrogated the effect of macrophages on malignant
transformation in the bionic airway chip culture. In vivo, macrophages promoted
lung tumorigenesis in a carcinogen-induced animal model. Similarly, blockage of NFκB, STAT3, or cyclinD1 using siRNA transfection decreased the carcinogen-induced
tumorigenesis in rats. We demonstrated that macrophages are critical in promoting
lung tumorigenesis and that the macrophage-initiated TNF-α/NF-κB/cyclinD1
and IL-6/STAT3/cyclinD1 pathways are primarily responsible for promoting lung
tumorigenesis.

Introduction

leading to uncontrolled cell proliferation, malignant
transformation, and tumor metastasis. Other studies
have demonstrated that chronic inflammation is closely
associated with tumorigenesis in the liver and intestine [2,
3], while numerous epidemiological studies have indicated
that chronic inflammation may also play a critical role in
lung tumorigenesis [4]. However, the key molecules and
signaling pathways that are involved in inflammationmediated lung tumorigenesis remain to be fully elucidated.
Indeed, the chronic inflammatory microenvironment
containing inflammatory cells, cytokines, and chemokines

Lung cancer is one of the leading causes of
morbidity and mortality in the world, accounting for
more than 1.6 million new cases and 1.3 million deaths
each year [1]. Elucidation of the molecular mechanisms
involved in lung tumorigenesis will lead to the emergence
of novel diagnostic and therapeutic approaches against
lung cancer. Accumulated knowledge shows that lung
tumorigenesis is a complex process that includes multiple
factors such as gene mutations or epigenetic changes,

can promote malignant transformation of bronchial
epithelial cells [5]. The persistent futile cycles of tissue
injury and repair during chronic inflammation are a critical
driver for lung cancer development and progression [6, 7].
Among these inflammatory cells in the lung, macrophages
are the most abundant and the key components that
link inflammation and cancer [8]. Infiltration of tumorassociated macrophages in tumor lesions is commonly
found in breast cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma,
colorectal cancer, and lung cancer and is associated with
tumor angiogenesis, invasion, and metastasis [9-12]. To
date, most studies have focused mainly on the role of
macrophages in tumor progression based on an established
tumor model with or without metastasis, but macrophages
are rarely involved in tumor initiation [13-15].
Moreover, to further study the functions of
macrophages in chronic airway inflammation-induced
tumorigenesis, it is necessary to establish a biomimetic
model that mimics the lung and airway microenvironment.
Currently, the best model that is used frequently is 2D cell
culture, which is far from the real environment in vivo.
In addition, the microfluidic chip shows a great potential
in biomimetic research and could be the ideal platform
for studying tumorigenesis of the airway epithelium
accompanied by macrophages [16, 17]. The microfluidic
chip, a technology that features fluidic manipulation at
the micrometer scale, has greatly improved biological
and medical research [18]. Compared to traditional
methods, microfluidics has numerous advantages like
high throughput, integration, low cost, continuous
flow, and real-time data analysis [19]. Recently, the
microfluidic chip has developed towards an “organ-onchip” model. The chips are commonly fabricated with
versatile and controllable channels, various microvalves
and micropumps, bioactive membranes, and integrated
electrical or magnetic biosensors. In these organ-onchip models, the key functions of an organ or the in
vivo microenvironments are simulated by microfluidic
engineering [17, 20, 21]. Hu et al. have successfully
fabricated a lung chip to form an alveolar-capillary barrier
to realize the exchange of gas and blood, thus providing a
comprehensive tool for lung disease research [17].
In this study, we intended to construct a
microfabricated airway mimic model to investigate the
role of macrophages and the underlying mechanisms in
chronic inflammation-mediated lung tumorigenesis. We
first employed 57 human lung cancer tissues originating
from the airways to assess the number of macrophages
in lung cancer and the adjacent normal tissues. Next, we
explored the potential tumorigenic role of macrophages
and the underlying signaling pathways in a benzopyrene
(BaP)-induced malignant transformation model with a
fabricated bionic airway chip. After that, we performed an
animal study to further confirm our in vitro data.

Distribution of macrophages in cancerous and
adjacent lung tissues
The level of macrophage infiltration in lung tissue
was assessed by immunostaining of CD68 protein in 57
formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded lung specimens. The
number of CD68-positive cells in the lung cancer tissues
was 119.56 ± 5.35, which was significantly higher than
that in the adjacent normal lung cancer tissues (26.75 ±
10.38; n = 57, p < 0.05; Fig. 2). Furthermore, the number
of CD68-positive cells in the lung cancer tissues was
closely associated with the pathological type and tumor
cell differentiation (p < 0.05; Table 1).

in the bionic airway chip
Next, we utilized the bionic airway chip to
mimic the in vivo conditions to assess the role of BaP,
macrophages, and different genes in the malignant
transformation of human bronchial epithelial cells.
After the cells were exposed to BaP, the morphology of
the 16HBE cells showed significant changes compared
to the untreated cells (Fig. 3); i.e., some cells showed
condensed nuclei and abnormal nuclear-cytoplasmic ratios
accompanied by atypical mitoses (Fig. 3B), compared to
the untreated cells (Fig. 3A). The appearance of abnormal
cells started to occur in passage 15 in the BaP group (Fig.
3B), whereas it occurred in passage 10 in the coculture
of BaP and macrophages group (Fig. 3C). However,
blockage of IL-6 or TNF-α signaling or inhibition of NFκB, STAT3, or cyclinD1 expression could prolong the
time when abnormal cells began to appear (Fig. 3D–H).
Furthermore, the cells in the BaP group and the coculture
of BaP and macrophages group showed multiple layers of
cell growth, an indication of lost cell contact inhibition
in cells at passage 30; however, this cell growth was not
observed in the coculture of BaP and macrophages groups
treated with inhibitors.
Tumorigenicity is characterized by growth
promotion. As shown in Fig. 4A, BaP treatment could
stimulate bronchial epithelial cell proliferation, while
macrophages also enhanced this effect. As expected,
blockage of cytokine IL-6 or TNF-α signaling or inhibition
of NF-κB, STAT3, or cyclinD1 expression inhibited cell
proliferation.
A cell colony formation assay using cells at
passages 30 and 40 in each group showed that the colony
formation efficiency in the BaP plus coculture group was

In addition, we also assessed their in vivo effects
using a nude mouse model of tumor formation. Thirty
days after cell transplantation into nude mice, there was
no tumor formation in the DMSO group, whereas tumors
did form in the BaP-treated group (Fig. 5A). The tumor
growth curve showed that the average tumor volume in the

BaP plus coculture group was larger than that of the same
passage of 16HBE cells alone exposed to BaP at different
observation time points (p < 0.05). However, blockage of
cytokine IL-6 or TNF-α signaling or inhibition of NF-κB,
STAT3, or cyclinD1 expression reduced the average tumor
volume (Fig. 5B; p < 0.05).

and cyclinD1 proteins were activated in the bronchial

Furthermore, macrophages were able to activate NF-κB,
STAT3, and cyclinD1 proteins (Fig. 6B). In addition, the
expression of NF-κB, STAT3, and cyclinD1 proteins was
induced in different passages of cells after exposure to BaP
(Fig. 6C).
Indeed, we found that macrophages were able
to promote the malignant transformation of bronchial
epithelial cells in vivo. First of all, we fabricated a chronic
lung inflammation model by using cigarette smoke. As
shown in Fig. 7A, the alveolar wall became thickened
and congested, and the small airway was narrow and

To demonstrate the critical role of the TNF-α/NFκB/cyclinD1 and IL-6/STAT3/cyclinD1 pathways in the
malignant transformation of 16HBE cells, we first detected
the expression levels of TNF-α, IL-6, NF-κB, STAT3, and
cyclinD1 in lung cancer tissues. As shown in Fig. 6A, NFκB, STAT3, and cyclinD1 were expressed in almost all
of the cancerous and adjacent lung tissues. However, the
expression of NF-κB, STAT3, and cyclinD1 in the lung
cancer tissues was significantly higher than that in the

compared to the normal rat lung (a). To confirm the role
of macrophages and the related signaling pathways in
rat lung tumorigenesis, we depleted macrophages and
knocked down the key factors in these signaling pathways.
As shown in Fig. 7B, a chemical carcinogen-induced rat
lung cancer model was successfully simulated. The rat
lung cancer model presented the following pathological
characteristics: normal bronchial epithelium (a), squamous
metaplasia (b), atypical hyperplasia (c), carcinoma in situ
(d), and invasive carcinoma (e). Finally, as shown in
Table 2, the tumorigenic rate in the MCA+DEN group
was 37.5% vs. no lung tumors found in the blank control
and inflammation groups. However, when macrophages
were depleted, the tumorigenic rate was significantly
decreased (25.0% vs. 85.7%). Furthermore, when the NFκB, STAT3, and cyclinD1 expression levels were knocked
down, the tumorigenic rates also showed different degrees
of reduction.

treated with or without BaP or different inhibitors or
siRNAs. After that, we confirmed our current in vitro
data in animal models. Our current study led to a number
of novel discoveries. First, macrophages were critical to
promote carcinogen-induced lung tumorigenesis. Second,
the TNF-α/NF-κB/cyclinD1 and IL-6/STAT3/cyclinD1
signaling pathways were primarily responsible for the
regulation of macrophage-promoted lung tumorigenesis.
Third, the bionic lung chip was an excellent platform to
investigate the cell–cell interactions that mimic the in vivo
situation. Our current data extended previous findings and
provided a novel technology for the in vitro study of cell–
cell interactions and gene regulations in vivo.
Indeed, many previous studies have demonstrated
that macrophages are able to support the growth of breast,
lung, and ovarian cancer in animal models. Our current
study provided evidence for the role of macrophages in
promoting lung tumor development, although previously,
macrophages have been commonly considered as a killer
of cancer cells due to their cytotoxic and phagocytic
activities. In our current study, we revealed that
macrophages have a strong protumorigenic function in
vitro and in vivo. In a previous study, Rinat et al. reported
that macrophages could promote lung tumorigenesis in
urethane-induced mice [22]. In addition, our current study
verified this notion based on both a bionic airway model

macrophages in the cancerous and adjacent lung tissues

and animal experiments. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first study regarding malignant transformation of
bronchial epithelial cells using a microfluidic chip culture.
We also found that macrophages were able to speed up the
course of malignant transformation of bronchial epithelial
cells.
Furthermore, our current study also showed that the
downregulation of NF-κB, STAT3, or cyclinD1 expression
or blockage of IL-6 or TNF-α activity could abrogate the
malignant transformation of bronchial epithelial cells in
vitro or decrease lung tumorigenesis in vivo. In the bionic
airway model in vitro, the expression of IL-6, TNF-α,
NF-κB, STAT3, or cyclinD1 was upregulated at the onset
of carcinogen exposure. Cell morphology, proliferation,
anchor-independent growth, and tumor formation in nude
mice were dynamically obvious. These results indicated
that IL-6, TNF-α, NF-κB, STAT3, and cyclinD1 were
the key factors during malignant transformation of
bronchial epithelial cells. In the rat lung cancer model, the
expression of NF-κB, STAT3, or cyclinD1 was knocked
down before carcinogen exposure and the tumorigenic
rate was decreased by varying degrees accordingly. These
findings suggested that the TNF-α/NF-κB/cyclinD1
and IL-6/STAT3/cyclinD1 signaling pathways are
two potential pathways in the course of tumorigenesis
mediated by macrophages. A previous study has shown
that M1 macrophage polarization is associated with a
good prognosis for lung cancer patients [23]. Despite
the fact that polarized M1 macrophages are considered
to have antitumor activity, persistent activation of these
cells may lead to cell damage, thereby causing malignant
transformation [24]. Pro-inflammatory cytokines produced
by M1 macrophages, such as IL-6 and TNF-α, have
been reported to protect initiated epithelial cells from
apoptosis and promote the proliferation of these cells
[25]. Our current study showed that the IL-6 and TNF-α
protein levels were significantly higher in the 16HBE
cell and macrophage coculture than those in 16HBE cells
only in the bionic airway model. In addition, NF-κB,
STAT3, and cyclinD1 proteins were gradually activated
in bronchial epithelial cells at higher passage numbers.
Therefore, we speculated that TNF-α and IL-6 secreted
from macrophages could activate NF-κB, STAT3, and
their downstream proteins, such as cyclinD1, thereby
stimulating cell proliferation and tumorigenesis. Indeed,
tumor cells acquire a number of characteristic alterations
during the course of malignant transformation, such as a
capacity for uncontrolled proliferation, tumor cell invasion
into the surrounding tissues, and metastasis [6]. These
properties are initiated, at least in part, by alterations of
cell signaling pathways, including MAPK, PI3K, and NFκB, which control cell proliferation, motility, and survival.
For example, the NF-κB pathway plays a vital role in the
malignant transformation of cells in chronic colitis and
hepatitis [3, 26]. However, there are many key signaling
molecules and pathways involved in the tumorigenesis
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

of lung cancer with chronic airway inflammation related
to macrophages. When chronic inflammation occurs,
the airways are infiltrated with macrophages and proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α,
which in turn activate the MAPK, PI3K, and NF-κB
pathways [27]. Indeed, previous studies have shown that
certain immunosuppressants such as rapamycin are useful
in cancer prevention and treatment, although others argue
that the use of immunosuppressants may be associated
with an increased risk of cancer [28]. Moreover, rapalogs
such as rapamycin have been used as a novel strategy for
cancer prevention because of their anti-aging or anticancer
activities [29]. Thus, the use of these agents to manipulate
these gene pathways could effectively prevent lung
carcinogenesis, but further study is warranted.
The bionic airway model used in this study was
a unique and ideal platform to investigate the cell–cell
interactions involved in the malignant transformation
of bronchial epithelial cells because this model vividly
simulates the real structure and microenvironment of the
airways in humans. Currently, the challenge of the organon-chip model is to recapitulate the healthy and diseased
physiology of multiple tissues or organs to mimic the in
vivo conditions in order to supplement animal studies for
preclinical drug development [30, 31]. Developing such
platforms could allow us to robustly mimic reliable tissue
or organ-level structural and functional outputs while
maintaining the simplicity required for high-throughput
systems. In this study, we designed, built, and tested an
in vitro model of healthy and carcinogenic human airway
structures. Using this human bionic airway chip culture
system, we demonstrated that we could recapitulate the
whole course of lung tumorigenesis. Compared to other
in vitro models, this novel platform has the following
advantages: its minute structure, high-oxygen permeable
PDMS materials, and a continuous flow of air and medium
that can mimic an in vivo microenvironment and meet
the requirements for human bronchial epithelial cell
culture. Therefore, compared to conventional platforms,
the research results from the microfluidic chip may be
more meaningful. Furthermore, this microfluidic chip can
be suitable for high-throughput screening for potential
signaling pathways, therapeutic targets, and time-lapse
imaging. More importantly, the microfluidic chip allowed
both morphological analysis and fluorescence marker
detection to fulfill the dynamic observation of cultured
cells and their signaling during the long-term exposure
of a carcinogen. Thus, this designed microfluidic chip is
a unique platform to study cell–cell interactions in the
malignant transformation of bronchial epithelial cells.
However, our current study does have some
limitations; for example, we only studied the interactions
of macrophages with bronchial cells in this bionic airway
chip culture and future research should incorporate
additional cell types (such as fibroblasts or endothelial
cells) into this system to study the cell–cell interactions.

antibodies were detected by using a Super Signal West
Pico Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., USA), followed
by quantitative densitometric analysis using Eagle Eye II
software.

Moreover, the underlying molecular mechanism by which
macrophages with or without BaP treatment interact with
bronchial cells is preliminary, and further study is needed
to clarify the role of the TNF-α/NF-κB/cyclinD1 and IL-6/
STAT3/cyclinD1 signaling pathways on the regulation of
malignant transformation of bronchial epithelial cells.

Construction and fabrication of the bionic airway
chip

Materials and Methods

To mimic the cell compartmentalization of the
airway in humans (Fig. 1A), we fabricated a working
biomimetic airway chip. The main body of the chip
consisted of three parts: two polydimethylsiloxane
(PDMS) layers (the top and bottom layers) and one
porous membrane layer (the middle layer) (Fig. 1B).
The PDMS microfluidic chip was fabricated using a
Sylgard 184 kit (Dow Corning, Midland, TX, USA) by
a standard soft lithography method. Briefly, two PDMS
layers were fabricated by replica molding against masters,
and a 5-μm pore polycarbonate membrane (Nuclepore,
Whatman, Buckinghamshire, UK) was bonded using wet
aminosilanization of the membrane and contact binding
with oxygen plasma-treated PDMS (150 mTorr, 50 W,
25 s). The microfabricated device was then continuously
supplied with air and cell growth medium to mimic the
real microenvironment of the bronchi in human lungs.
The human bronchial epithelial cell line 16HBE (obtained
from the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing,
China) and macrophages were cultured on the top and
bottom of the porous membrane, respectively. The ratio
of 16HBE cells and macrophages was 10:1 (16HBE cells/
macrophages). The upper channel pumped sterile air, and
the bottom channel simultaneously pumped cell culture
medium using a syringe pump.

Tissue specimens
This study was approved by the Institutional
Review Board and Human Ethics Committee of The
Second Affiliated Hospital of Dalian Medical University,
and a written informed consent form was obtained from
individual patients. Briefly, a total of 57 lung cancer
patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were
recruited from The Second Hospital, Dalian Medical
University (Dalian, China), between January 2013 and
August 2013. The demographic and clinical data are
shown in Supplementary Table 1. The lung cancer tissues
and adjacent tissues after surgical removal were isolated
from the primary tumor and stored in liquid nitrogen.

Immunohistochemistry
The distribution of macrophages in the lung
cancer tissues and adjacent tissues was assessed by
immunostaining of CD68 protein, an established marker
of macrophages, with an antibody against CD68 and the
SP-9000 HistostainTM-Plus Kit (ZYMED, MA, USA),
as described previously [32]. The immunostained tissue
sections were reviewed and scored independently under
a microscope by two investigators. Specifically, staining
of CD68 expression was visualized as a brown color in
the cytoplasm and estimated by averaging the number of
positive-stained cells under 10 high-power vision fields.

Establishment of the BaP-induced tumorigenic
transformation model
According to methods reported previously [33],
16HBE cells were continuously exposed to 10 μM BaP
(Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA, diluted in dimethyl
sulfoxide, DMSO) in serum-free medium with a mouse
liver S9 mixture (drug-metabolizing enzymes, carcinogen
activators) for 4 h, respectively, every 7 days for 5 weeks.
16HBE cells exposed to DMSO were used as a vector
control. 16HBE cells were cultured under these conditions
for 40 passages. During this period of time, 16HBE cells
were collected from the channels of the bionic airway chip
and assayed for cell proliferation, migration, invasion,
colony formation, and tumorigenicity in nude mice.
To determine the role of macrophages in the
malignant transformation of bronchial epithelial
cells, macrophages were added into the BaP-induced
tumorigenic transformation model. Briefly, the BaPinduced 16HBE cells were cultured with or without
macrophages at a ratio of 10:1 (16HBE cells/

Protein extraction and western blot
Protein lysates from cancerous and normal lung
tissues as well as 16HBE cells were separated by sodium
dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDSPAGE) and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes
(BioTraceTM, Pall Corporation, San Diego, CA, USA).
After blocking with 5% skim milk in phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS), the membranes were incubated with a
primary antibody against the selected key proteins,
including NF-κB p65 or phospho-NF-κB p65 (Ser536)
(1:1000; Abcam, Cambridge, UK), STAT3 or phosphoSTAT3 (Ser727) (1:1000; Abcam), cyclinD1 (1:1000;

macrophages) in each passage of 16HBE cells. The
time of tumor appearance and the severity of related
tumorigenic indicators such as cell proliferation and
anchor-independent growth were compared.
To demonstrate the role of the NF-κB and STAT3
signaling pathways in the malignant transformation of
bronchial epithelial cells, inhibition of the key signaling
molecules was performed in this model. We introduced
IL-6 neutralizing antibody (1:400, Abcam, ab6672),
TNF-α neutralizing antibody (1:200, Abcam, ab9635),
NF-κB inhibitor BAY11-7082 (2 μM, InvivoGen), STAT3

each passage after the last BaP exposure.

back of nude mice (n = 3 per group). The tumor size was
calculated according to the formula V = L × W2 / 2 every
5 days after cell inoculation. The tumor was removed and
weighed on the 30th day.

Detection of NF-κB and STAT3 expression in the
BaP-induced malignant transformation of 16HBE
cells
The expression and localization of NF-κB and
STAT3 signaling pathway proteins were assessed by
either immunofluorescence or western blotting. For
immunofluorescence staining, 16HBE cells, BaP-induced
16HBE cells, and BaP-induced 16HBE cells cultured with
macrophages at passages 10, 20, 30, and 40 were collected
from the channels of the bionic airway chip, fixed,
permeabilized, stained with 1:200 diluted phospho-NF-κB
p65 (Ser536) antibody (Abcam), phospho-STAT3 (Ser727)
antibody (Abcam), and cyclinD1 antibody (Abcam), and
visualized using AlexaFluor488 or AlexaFluor594-labeled
secondary antibodies, followed by review and scoring
under a laser scanning confocal microscope (Leica TCS
SP5, Mannheim, Germany).

Cell morphology observation
16HBE cells were collected from the channels every
five passages, starting from passage 5 to passage 30, then
fixed with ice cold methanol, stained with Giemsa stain,
and observed under an inverted microscope.

instructions. Briefly, cells were labeled with EdU, fixed
with paraformaldehyde, stained for Apollo and DNA, and
reviewed under a fluorescence microscope (Nikon Eclipse
Ti, Japan).

Eighty male Wistar rats (6 weeks old, 180 ± 20
g) were purchased from the Laboratory Animal Center
of Dalian Medical University. The experiments were
approved by the Laboratory Animals Committee of
Dalian Medical University. Sixty rats were instilled with
the carcinogens 3-methylcholanthrene (MCA, 10 mg)
and diethylnitrosamine (DEN, 10 μl) (Sigma–Aldrich) in
an iodized oil mixture into the left lung using a method
established previously [34]; 10 rats were left untreated as
a blank control. At the end of the experiment, the rats were
euthanized under anesthesia and the whole lungs were
immediately excised. The left lungs were fixed with 4%
formaldehyde in PBS for 24 h, embedded in paraffin, and
subjected to hematoxylin-eosin staining.
To investigate the role of macrophages in rat lung
carcinogenesis, 50 carcinogen-instilled rats were exposed
to cigarette smoke for 2 h each day for 3 months, and the
remaining 10 carcinogen-instilled rats were untreated as
a positive control. In addition, 10 rats were only exposed
to cigarette smoke as a smoking control. Furthermore,
macrophages were depleted by instilling clodronate
(Sigma-Aldrich)-containing liposomes as described
previously [22].
Moreover, to determine the role of the NF-κB and
STAT3 pathways in rat lung carcinogenesis, we knocked
down the expression of NF-κB, STAT3, and cyclinD1 by
injection of NF-κB, STAT3, and cyclinD1 siRNA (Santa

Cell anchor-independent growth assay
A soft agar assay was performed to assess the ability
of 16HBE cells at passages 30 and 40 to grow on soft agar.
The cells at a density of 2000/well were cultured for 2
weeks in 0.3% low-melting point agarose (Sigma-Aldrich)
in complete medium that was overlaid on 0.6% agarose in
six-well plates. Individual cell colonies with more than 50
cells were counted under a microscope.

Tumor formation assay in nude mice
Nude mice were utilized to assess tumor formation
in vivo. Specifically, BALB/c-nu nude mice (4 weeks
old) were purchased from the Laboratory Animal Centre,
Dalian Medical University, and the animal study was
approved by the Life Sciences Institutional Review Board
of Dalian Medical University. The transformed 16HBE
cells (5 × 106/ml) in 200 μL of PBS were injected into the
