ABSTRACT
Neoadjuvant chemo(radio)therapy followed by surgery is the standard of care for
patients with locally advanced resectable esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC). There is
increasing evidence that drug resistance might be related to genomic heterogeneity.
We investigated whether genomic tumor heterogeneity is different after cytotoxic
chemotherapy and is associated with EAC patient survival. We used arrayCGH and a
quantitative assessment of the whole genome DNA copy number aberration patterns
(‘DNA copy number entropy’) to establish the level of genomic tumor heterogeneity
in 80 EAC treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgery (CS group)
or surgery alone (S group). The association between DNA copy number entropy,
clinicopathological variables and survival was investigated.
DNA copy number entropy was reduced after chemotherapy, even if there was
no morphological evidence of response to therapy (p<0.001). Low DNA copy number
entropy was associated with improved survival in the CS group (p=0.011) but not in
the S group (p=0.396).
Our results suggest that cytotoxic chemotherapy reduces DNA copy number
entropy, which might be a more sensitive tumor response marker than changes in
the morphological tumor phenotype. The use of DNA copy number entropy in clinical
practice will require validation of our results in a prospective study.

disease progression and resistance to therapy.
Cytotoxic chemotherapy exerts one of the strongest
selection pressures on cancer cells implying that
chemotherapy treatment may favor the persistence of
treatment resistant subpopulations [6].
It has been suggested that drug resistance might be
related to genomic tumor heterogeneity [7]. High levels
of genomic tumor heterogeneity in pre-treatment biopsies
have been related to poor response to chemotherapy
in EAC [8], as well as been related to poor outcome in
head and neck cancers [9] and adenocarcinomas of the
lung [10]. However, when measured in paired samples
taken before and after chemotherapy, results are variable
showing no change in genomic tumor heterogeneity in
breast and ovarian cancer [11, 12], decreasing genomic
tumor heterogeneity in acute myeloid leukemia [13] and
newly acquired genomic changes in acute lymphoblastic
leukemia [14].
Several studies have demonstrated the existence
of genomic and/or phenotypic tumor heterogeneity in
EAC [15-20]. The presence of genomic heterogeneity
in Barrett’s esophagus, an endoscopically identifiable
precursor lesion of EAC, is predictive of progression to
adenocarcinoma [17], and its presence in pre-treatment
EAC biopsies has been related to poor chemotherapy
response [8]. The relationship between genomic tumor
heterogeneity and patient outcome and the effect of
cytotoxic chemotherapy on genomic tumor heterogeneity
have not been investigated in EAC to date.
Whole genome copy number profiling using
array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) can
provide a snapshot of the global DNA copy number
aberration pattern. In this hypothesis-generating study,
we used aCGH to quantify the degree of genomic tumor
heterogeneity within a group of samples by estimating
the DNA copy number entropy [21]. This allowed us to
explore the differences in the DNA copy number entropy
between EAC patients from the OE02 trial treated with
neoadjuvant chemotherapy (CS group) and those treated
by surgery alone (S group), and to examine the association
of DNA copy number entropy with clinicopathological
variables, histopathologically measured tumor regression
grade according to Mandard and patient survival.

EAC in the CS group had a significantly lower DNA
copy number entropy value compared to EAC in the S
group (median DNA copy number entropy (range) CS
group: -0.524 (-1.801 to 1.289) versus S group: 0.321
(-1.411 to 1.315), p<0.001, Figure 2), indicating that
EACs in the CS group had DNA copy number aberrations
at relatively similar genomic locations. The differences
and similarities in DNA copy number profiles between
the CS and the S group can also be seen in a principal
component scatter plot, Figure 3. These plots show that
the DNA copy number values (as summarized by their first
two principal components) from the S group were much
more spread out (Figure 3B) than those from the CS group
(Figure 3A), indicating that the variation of the DNA copy
number aberrations between EACs in the S group is higher
than between EACs in the CS group. In other words, the
inter-tumor heterogeneity of the aCGH profile is reduced
in EACs after chemotherapy.
The comparison of the DNA copy number entropy
values between the CS group and the S group stratified
by chromosome showed that DNA copy number entropy
values for chromosome 1 and chromosome 5 were
significantly different. Median DNA copy number entropy
(range) of chromosome 1 was -0.296 (-4.165 to 1.213)
in the CS group compared to 0.483 (-3.070 to 1.645) in
the S group, p=0.001. Similarly, the median DNA copy
number entropy (range) of chromosome 5 was -0.271
(-3.800 to 1.255) in the CS group compared to 0.413
(-3.238 to 1.647) in the S group, p=0.03. However, related
to the very high complexity of the aCGH profiles, we
were not able to identify specific probes or genes neither
on chromosome 1 nor on chromosome 5 which were
significantly different between the treatment groups after
applying rigorous multiple testing corrections. For all
other chromosomes, the DNA copy number entropy values
were not statistically significantly different between the
CS and the S group (Supplementary Figure S5 and S6).
Although the median DNA copy number entropy
values increased with increasing Mandard tumor
regression grade category e.g. the highest DNA copy
number entropy values were seen in EAC with no
histological evidence of tumor regression (Mandard
grade 5), this relationship was not statistically significant
(Mandard grade 3 median DNA copy number entropy:
-1.597; Mandard grade 4: -0.696; Mandard grade 5:
-0.292, p > 0.1). The lack of statistical significance could
be related to the relatively small sample size in the current
study. Interestingly, the DNA copy number entropy values
of EACs in the S group were significantly higher than
the DNA copy number entropy values of EACs in the CS
group with no histological evidence of tumor regression
(Mandard grade 5, n=26) (median (range) DNA copy
number entropy of Mandard grade 5 EACs in the CS
group: -0.292 (-1.801 to 0.685), median (range) DNA copy
number entropy in the S group: 0.321 (-1.411 to 1.315), p<
0.001, Figure 4).

The smaller the shaded area, the more similar the samples within the group. The scatter plots show that there is less inter-tumor variation in
the CS group which is indicative of a higher level of inter-tumor homogeneity reflected in a low DNA copy number entropy value. In the

DNA copy number entropy value.

Relationship between DNA copy number
entropy, clinicopathological variables and
patient survival

Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that the group of
patients with low DNA copy number entropy (≤ -0.5670),
e.g. with DNA copy number aberrations at similar
genomic locations, survived significantly longer than
patients with high DNA copy number entropy, e.g. DNA
copy number aberration at multiple different genomic
locations, p=0.024, Figure 5A. Cross tabulation between
DNA copy number entropy group and treatment group
indicated that 29 (83%) S group patients fell into the high
DNA copy number entropy group (entropy > -0.5670),
whereas patients from the CS group were equally
distributed between the high and low DNA copy number
entropy group (Figure 5). This observation prompted us
to further explore the relationship between DNA copy
number entropy and survival by treatment arm.
Cox regression analysis using continuous DNA
copy number entropy values showed that DNA copy
number entropy was significantly associated with cancer
specific survival in the CS group (HR: 1.775, 95% CI:
1.047-3.009, p=0.033) but not in the S group (HR: 1.144,
95%CI: 0.699-1.871, p=0.593). For visualization of the
Cox regression analysis results, Kaplan-Meier survival
plots were created stratifying patients by using the
median DNA copy number entropy per treatment group

No association was found between depth of tumor
invasion (pT/ypT), lymph node status (pN/ypN), grade
of differentiation, lymphatic channel invasion, venous
invasion or perineural invasion, and DNA copy number
entropy neither when investigating these associations by
treatment arm nor in the combined group (Supplementary
Table S1).
As a consequence of our case selection (selecting
short-term and long-term survivors in both groups, see
Material and Methods), the survival was not significantly
different between the S and CS group. Thus, initial
survival analyses were performed combining the two
groups. Low DNA copy number entropy was significantly
associated with longer cancer specific survival in the
whole patient group (HR: 1.382, 95%CI: 1.014-1.884,
p=0.041). For Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, three equal
sized patient groups were created based on the DNA copy
number entropy values. As the survival curves of two of
these groups overlapped substantially (Supplementary
Figure S4), these two groups were subsequently merged.

of EAC from patients treated by surgery alone (right side of the panel) is significantly higher than that of EAC treated with neoadjuvant
chemotherapy showing no histopathological evidence of tumor regression (left side of the panel), p<0.001. Line perpendicular to the long

entropy had a significantly better survival (median (range)
survival time: 6.9 years (0 to 15.6 years)) compared to
CS group patients with high DNA copy number entropy
(0.9 years (0.7 to 0.97 years), p=0.011, Figure 5B). No
relationship between DNA copy number entropy and
survival was found in the S group patients (p=0.396,
Figure 5C). Cox regression analysis showed that there is
no evidence of a treatment interaction effect (treatment
interaction p=0.654). Hence, we have no evidence that
the effect of the DNA copy number entropy depends on
the treatment.

In order to assess whether the aCGH profiles and
DNA copy number entropy of EAC of the current study
are comparable to previously published EAC DNA
copy number data, the frequency of DNA copy number
aberrations and DNA copy number entropy of the S
group EACs were compared to two recently published
data sets [22, 23]. Visual inspection of the DNA copy
number aberration frequency plots from all three studies

Relationship between DNA copy number entropy
and percentage of tumor cells/area

DISCUSSION
There have been a number of DNA copy number
studies in esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) in the past,
reporting different candidate genes or group of genes
related to tumor progression or patient survival [18-20,
23-26]. A common finding of all previous EAC studies as
well as the current study is that the overall level of DNA
copy number alterations in EAC was very high leading
to very complex DNA copy number profiles. However,
only few aberrations were shared across more than 10%
of samples supporting the existence of a high degree of
genomic tumor heterogeneity in EAC.
The frequency of DNA copy number aberrations
(irrespective of the genes involved) has been related to

EAC from the CS group had a median of 70%
tumor cells/area ranging from 30 to 90% (Supplementary
Figure S2). EAC from the S group had a median of 50%
tumor cells/area ranging from 30 to 70%. There was no
association between the DNA copy number entropy and the
estimated tumor percentage/area neither in the CS group
nor the S group (p=0.412 and p=0.531, respectively). There
was also no significant difference in the percentage of tumor
cells/area between the long-term and short-term survivors in
any of the groups (CS: p=0.103; S: p=0.439). We observed
neither considerable differences in scatterness between the
high and the low tumor cells/area groups nor differences

survival in EAC in some but not all studies [23-25]. The
current study is the first study to quantify the DNA copy
number entropy by whole genome aCGH as a surrogate
measure of genomic inter-tumor heterogeneity using
DNA extracted from resection material from patients who
were either treated by surgery alone (S group) or by 5FU/
cisplatin chemotherapy followed by surgery (CS group) as
part of the OE02 trial [1].
We found no relationship between DNA
copy number entropy and any of the investigated
clinicopathological data neither in the S group nor in the
CS group. Importantly, there was also no statistically
significant association between DNA copy number entropy
and Mandard tumor regression grade of the primary tumor
(only investigated in the CS group) or percentage of tumor/
area (investigated in both groups). These results provide
some confidence that the DNA copy number entropy is
not simply a surrogate of some other pathological variable
or known prognostic factor. Our findings are consistent
with results reported in head and neck cancer where the
variability of the mutant-allele fraction was used as marker
of genomic tumor heterogeneity [9].
Our study showed that EACs after chemotherapy
have DNA copy number profiles in which the aberrations
were found more frequently at relatively similar locations,
making them more ‘homogenous’ when measured by DNA
copy number entropy compared to chemo-naïve EACs
(Figure 3). In contrast, Almendro et al [11] reported a
change in the morphological but not the genomic phenotype
of the tumor cells in breast cancer after chemotherapy. Our
study showed no difference in the morphological tumor
phenotype comparing EAC from the S group with those
from the CS group with Mandard grade 5 (no pathological
response). However, we found a significant difference in
the genomic phenotype between Mandard grade 5 EACs
from the CS group and EACs from the S group. This
discrepancy between studies could be related to different
tumor types (EAC vs. breast cancer) as well as substantial
differences in investigated markers (whole genome vs. few
selected markers) used to characterize the tumor phenotype
and genotype. Further studies in a larger sample size need
to verify whether DNA copy number entropy might be a
clinically useful biomarker of response to chemotherapy.
Our analyses comparing the DNA copy number
entropy per chromosome between treatment groups showed
that the difference in the DNA copy number entropy was
strongly associated with the DNA copy number entropy in
chromosome 1 and 5. The underlying mechanisms for this
finding are currently unclear and warrant future studies.
So far, there is no evidence from previous aCGH studies
suggesting clinically relevant candidate genes on these
particular chromosomes in EAC and we were unable to
identify any individual significantly different probe or group
of genes on these chromosomes in the current study.
Low DNA copy number entropy was only related
to better outcome in EAC patients who had received
chemotherapy prior to surgery. Mroz et al [9] reported the
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

relation between tumor heterogeneity and patient outcome
in head and neck cancer patients treated by surgery
alone as well as in those treated with chemotherapy.
Murugaesu et al [8] reported that intra-tumoral genomic
heterogeneity of the pre-treatment biopsy is related to poor
response to platinum based chemotherapy. However, both
studies determined genomic tumor heterogeneity prior to
chemotherapy, whereas we measured DNA copy number
in material after chemotherapy, hence results are not
directly comparable.
We compared the aCGH profiles and the DNA copy
number entropy of the surgery alone group with published
data sets [22, 23]. Visual inspection showed that major
aberrations like copy number losses in chromosome
(Chr) 3, gains in Chr7, Chr8 and Chr20 were present in
all studies. Hence, we think that findings in this study
were unlikely to be dataset specific. Due to difference
in platforms and hence differences in data resolution,
statistical assessment and quantification of the differences
were not possible. Since, post-chemotherapy aCGH data
from EAC have not been published to date, no comparison
to previous data could be made for this group.
In conclusion, this is the first study to quantify
genomic
tumor
heterogeneity
in
esophageal
adenocarcinoma, and to suggest that it might contribute to
survival differences after chemotherapy.
Our result requires validation in a larger
independent cohort ideally comparing pre- and postchemotherapy samples from the same tumor to directly
measure the change in DNA copy number entropy
induced by chemotherapy. The presence of genomic
tumor heterogeneity, together with low frequencies of
common aberrations across multiple cancers, makes the
identification of predictive/prognostic biomarkers in EAC
challenging, unless DNA copy number entropy itself
can be used for this purpose. For the first time, we can
show that cytotoxic chemotherapy appears to effect the
tumor genotype (DNA copy number) in cases where the
human eye cannot see any changes in the histological
phenotype, suggesting that we might need to re-evaluate
and potentially adapt the morphology based assessment
criteria of primary tumor regression grading in particular
in cases with a high tumor cell content per area.
A better understanding of the mechanisms leading
to genomic tumor heterogeneity is urgently needed before
novel therapeutic strategies can be developed and outcome
of EAC patients can finally be improved.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Esophageal adenocarcinoma patient cohort
The UK MRC OE02 trial recruited 802 patients
with locally advanced esophageal cancer who were
randomized to either two cycles of cisplatin/5-fluorouracil
(5-FU) followed by surgery (CS group) or treatment by
surgery alone (S group) between 1992 and 1998 [1].

Formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue
blocks from the resection specimens were retrospectively
collected from 510 OE02 trial patients. For this pilot
study, 40 patients from the CS group and 40 patients
from the S group were selected based on the availability
of appropriate material for DNA extraction and the
following criteria: (1) presence of adenocarcinoma in the
pre-treatment biopsy, (2) CS patients were known to have
received at least one cycle of pre-operative chemotherapy,
(3) patients were reported to have died from esophageal
cancer. In order to increase the chance to detect potential
prognostic markers within treatment groups, patients were
further selected based on their survival time to ensure that
in each treatment group 50% patients that had died within
12 months after randomization (short-term survivors) and
50% had survived at least 36 months after randomization
(long-term survivors). Consequently, this selection
resulted in a data set with large differences in survival
within treatment groups and no survival difference
between treatment groups (p=0.62). Median (range)
follow up of short-term survivors was 0.72 years (0.28 to
0.97 years) and 0.46 years (0.30 to 0.67 years) in the CS
and S group, respectively. Median (range) follow up of
long-term survivors was 7.65 years (3.07 to 10.76 years)
and 7.30 years (3.23 to 11.62 years) in the CS and S group,
respectively. The median age (range) was 60.1 years (39.8
to 83.15 years) and 65.13 years (40.87 to 75.77 years) in
the CS and S group, respectively.
The hematoxylin and eosin stained glass slides
from all retrieved resection specimens and the original
histopathology reports were reviewed to establish the
histopathology data set used for analyses. Regression
of the primary tumor was graded according to Mandard
et al [27] centrally. Cases were staged according to the
6th edition of the TNM classification [28]. Details of the
clinicopathological data of the patient cohort can be found

oligonucleotides, located at 238 of the Cancer Census
genes (http://www.sanger.ac.uk/genetics/CGP/Census/).
Oligonucleotide positions were defined according to
the NCBI36/hg18 assembly (March 2006). Labeling and
hybridization were performed as described previously by
Buffart et al [31]. Agilent’s feature extraction software
(v10.5.1.1) with default settings was used to quantify the
fluorescence intensities of all 180,880 features. aCGH
data have been deposited in NCBI’s Gene Expression
Omnibus and are accessible through GEO accession
number GSE56106.

aCGH data pre-processing
aCGH data were generated from 75 cases. The raw
data underwent a series of pre-processing steps, which
are detailed in Section S1 of the Supplementary file. The
pre-processing was performed within the R statistical
environment. After quantification, control spots (n=6,539)
were removed from the data yielding 174,341 features.
Both channels were background corrected by subtracting
background median intensities from foreground median
intensities to obtain an unbiased hybridization signal.
Normalization, cellularity correction and segmentation
were performed with the R-package CGHcall [32]. The
median absolute deviation (MAD) was calculated for all
probes from all chromosomes as described by [33] as a
measure of the technical quality of the aCGH experiment.
All statistical analyses were performed using segmented
data.

Statistical analyses
DNA copy number profiles of the patients
included in the current study were compared with two
previously published DNA copy number data sets (Gene
Expression Omnibus (GEO) database accession number:
GSE36460 and GSE20154) [22, 23]. All raw datasets
were pre-processed and segmented following the same
procedures as used in this study. The genomic locations
of CGH probes across studies were matched using the
R-package sigaR [34] and a mean segmented data profile
(average across samples) was generated for each data set
(Supplementary Figure S1).
Next, we quantified the degree of genomic tumor
heterogeneity for each case by assessing the overall
DNA copy number aberration pattern and estimating the
DNA copy number entropy using the segmented data
and the R-package sigaR [34] (see supplementary file
for mathematical description of the entropy calculation).
The mean DNA copy number entropy was compared
between treatment groups using permutation for
p-value calculation, where the test statistic equals the
entropy difference between the groups. To visualize the
intersample heterogeneity, as measured by the DNA copy
number entropy, the segmented data matrix was projected

DNA extraction and DNA copy number analysis
The tumor cell content per macrodissected tumor
tissue area was estimated. As it had been shown previously
that DNA copy number analyses from tumors with less
than 30% tumor cells/area can be severely compromised
[29], five cases (all from the S group) with less than 30%
tumor cells/area had to be excluded from further analyses.
DNA was extracted from a single FFPE tissue block
containing the highest tumor cell density per area as well
as from normal tissue (lymph node or normal esophageal
wall) from the same patient as described previously [30].
High-resolution array comparative genomic
hybridization (aCGH) was performed using custom
design 180K Agilent microarrays (4x180k array, Agilent

on its first two principal components and scatter plots were
generated for each treatment group.
The DNA copy number entropy of a sample without
DNA copy number aberrations, such as normal tissue,
is very low to minimal. Tumor samples can have near
zero, few or many DNA copy number aberrations and,
thus, the DNA copy number entropy value can range
from minimal/low to high [21]. In order to investigate
the potential contribution of an individual chromosome
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

to the observed difference in DNA copy number entropy
between treatment groups, the entropy-based data analysis
approach was also applied to each chromosome separately.
To establish whether there was any relationship
between differences in the DNA copy number entropy and
tumor cellularity of the sample, we constructed a linear
model with tumor cellularity as confounder. Furthermore,
the segmented data profiles of <50% (low cellularity)
and >= 50% (high cellularity) samples in each treatment

arm were projected on its first two principal components
separately, for visual inspection of the difference in
scatterness.
The association between DNA copy number entropy
and cancer specific survival was investigated using a Cox
proportional hazards model. The potential prognostic
value of the treatment, in addition to DNA copy number
entropy, was investigated in a Cox proportional hazards
model.
The associations between DNA copy number
entropy and tumor regression grade (CS group only),
depth of invasion (pT/ypT), lymph node status (pN/
ypN) and grade of differentiation were investigated using
the test statistic implemented in the R-package sigaR.
P-values <0.05 were considered statistically significant
for single tests, and Benjamini-Hochberg corrected false
discovery rates (FDR) <0.1 were considered statistically
significant for multiple tests. Statistical analyses were
performed using R, version 3.0.
The study was approved by the London – South East
ethics committee (REC reference: 07/H1102/111).
