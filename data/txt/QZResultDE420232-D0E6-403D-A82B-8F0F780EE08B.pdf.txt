BACKGROUND: Long-term chemotherapy-related cognitive dysfunction (CRCD) affects a large number of cancer survivors. To the
authors’ knowledge, to date there is no established treatment for this survivorship problem. The authors herein report results of a
small randomized controlled trial of a cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), Memory and Attention Adaptation Training (MAAT), compared with an attention control condition. Both treatments were delivered over a videoconference device. METHODS: A total of 47
survivors of female breast cancer who reported CRCD were randomized to MAAT or supportive therapy and were assessed at baseline, after treatment, and at 2 months of follow-up. Participants completed self-report measures of cognitive symptoms and quality of
life and a brief telephone-based neuropsychological assessment. RESULTS: MAAT participants made gains in perceived (selfreported) cognitive impairments (P 5 .02), and neuropsychological processing speed (P 5 .03) compared with supportive therapy
controls. A large MAAT effect size was observed at the 2-month follow-up with regard to anxiety concerning cognitive problems
(Cohen’s d for standard differences in effect sizes, 0.90) with medium effects noted in general function, fatigue, and anxiety. Survivors rated MAAT and videoconference delivery with high satisfaction. CONCLUSIONS: MAAT may be an efficacious psychological
treatment of CRCD that can be delivered through videoconference technology. This research is important because it helps to identify

INTRODUCTION
Two decades of research have indicated that a large subgroup of cancer survivors experience long-standing cognitive dysfunction after the completion of chemotherapy.1,2 Although the exact prevalence of chemotherapy-related cognitive dysfunction (CRCD) remains unknown, the body of evidence suggests that approximately 25% to 40% of chemotherapy
recipients demonstrate persistent mild to moderate cognitive changes.1 Cognitive effects can endure for years and
adversely affect survivor quality of life (QOL); disruption to employment (reduced hours or termination) and social and
family life is common.3,4 Greater than 650,000 patients receive chemotherapy annually and owing largely to improved
cancer screening and treatment, the number of individuals living with a cancer diagnosis in the United States is estimated
to reach 18 million by 2022.5 These numbers highlight the need for effective CRCD treatment.
Memory and Attention Adaptation Training (MAAT) is a cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) designed to
treat patients with CRCD. MAAT not only addresses survivor cognitive performance but also emphasizes the promotion of adaptive behavior changes in work life, home life, and social activity to compensate for cognitive difficulties. In the CRCD literature, the neuropsychological domains most commonly affected by chemotherapy
among cancer survivors are verbal memory, verbal working memory (eg, remembering a planned act), and processing speed. Cognitive changes in these domains are most often moderate to mild.1,2 However, under increased
stress demand, even mild changes in cognitive abilities can greatly interfere with task performance. Consequently,
survivors experience decreased self-efficacy in personal performance and increases in anxiety, depressed mood, and
social role changes.2,3,6

Videoconference CBT and Memory Dysfunction/Ferguson et al

In the current study, we present results of a smallscale randomized controlled trial (RCT) evaluating the efficacy and feasibility of MAAT delivered through videoconferencing to a sample of breast cancer survivors (BCS)
with CRCD. An in-person version of MAAT has been
pilot-tested and evaluated with a wait-list RCT in past
studies.7,8 MAAT produced improved QOL and verbal
memory and high satisfaction ratings among BCS who
had cognitive symptoms. However, MAAT has not been
tested against an active treatment control condition to
account for the effects of social attention and support. In
addition, many cancer survivors who may benefit from
specialized survivorship care do not receive services due to
travel burden, work schedules, and time restrictions.9
MAAT is flexibly designed and can be readily delivered
through electronic technology. No difference in patient
outcomes, perception of therapeutic relationships, or
general satisfaction has been found between electronic
delivery or face-to-face delivery of psychological treatments.10,11 We hypothesized that BCS who receive
MAAT delivered through videoconferencing would demonstrate greater improvement in self-reported cognitive
impairments, neuropsychological test performance, and
QOL compared with BCS who receive videoconference
supportive therapy (ST).
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Design

The current study is a 2 (MAAT vs ST) 3 3 (baseline, after treatment, and at 2-month follow-up) RCT with
MAAT and ST delivered over videoconference device. A
sample size of 48 patients was derived using power estimates (80%; a 5 .05) to detect differences on Functional
Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Cognitive Function
(FACT-Cog) scales based on previous research.12,13 The
active control condition, ST, is intended to control
“nonspecific” psychotherapeutic effects such as therapeutic attention and alliance, treatment expectation, empathy, and support.14,15 Both MAAT and ST involved 8
weekly visits of 30 to 45 minutes each. Computer randomization to treatment type (MAAT or ST) was performed for participant numbers, which was revealed to
the participant after baseline assessment. All assessments
consisted of self-report measures mailed to BCS who completed them at home along with a brief telephoneadministered neuropsychological battery test. The psychometrist responsible for all assessments remained blind
to each participant’s assigned treatment condition
throughout the study. MAAT and ST were delivered by 2

authors (R.J.F. and S.T.S., respectively) who are licensed
clinical psychologists with substantial experience in CBT
research. Participants were assessed after the sixth of 8 visits with regard to treatment credibility and expectation.
After treatment completion, each participant rated treatment satisfaction. All research methods were approved by
the Eastern Maine Medical Center Institutional Review
Board.
Participants

Volunteer BCS were recruited through several means: 1)
the Lafayette Family Cancer Center tumor registry; 2)
newspaper advertisement; 3) flyers placed at local hospitals and breast cancer support services; and 4) referrals
from medical oncologists and oncology nursing and social
work services. Inclusion criteria included: 1) a diagnosis of
Stage I, II, or IIIA breast cancer (TNM staging system of
the of Union for International Cancer Control); 2) status
of at least 6 months after treatment and currently disease
free; 3) treatment involved adjuvant chemotherapy; 4)
reported cognitive problems attributed to chemotherapy;
5) a score of 10 on the FACT-Cog Impact of Quality of
Life Scale; 6) ability to read English; and 7) ability to provide informed consent (legal adult). Exclusion criteria
included: 1) previous treatment with central nervous system radiation or intrathecal therapy; 2) surgery involving
the central nervous system; 3) neurobehavioral risk factors
including brain injury; 4) a history of neurological disorder, substance abuse, or learning disability; 5) meeting criteria for an active Axis I psychiatric disorder (Diagnostic
and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition,
Text Revision [DSM-IV-TR]); and 6) severe hearing
impairment. Although there is evidence that hormonal
therapies are associated with cognitive dysfunction, we
did not exclude BCS who were currently receiving hormonal therapies (eg, selective estrogen receptor modulators
or aromatase inhibitors). This was due to the large numbers of individuals with hormone-positive breast cancers
who receive these medicines for recurrence risk reduction
several years after chemotherapy.16
Interested BCS were screened on the telephone with
research criteria and a brief structured interview (Primary
Care Evaluation of Mental Disorders [PRIME-MD]) to
rule out psychiatric disorders.17 Individuals were also read
the 4 items that comprise the FACT-Cog Impact on
Quality of Life Scale to determine whether the score was
10 (inclusion criterion 5). This scale assesses distress
and perceived QOL interference that cognitive problems
cause (eg, “These problems have interfered with the quality of my life”). The cutoff score represents approximately
1783

Original Article

1 standard deviation (SD) below the mean score of a sample of BCS 6 months after chemotherapy (unpublished
data). Thus, the intent was to select survivors with at least
a moderate to high negative impact on their QOL. Once a
person met eligibility, the research coordinator mailed 2
copies of an informed consent form that also included
written consent to release medical information for chart
review (to verify diagnosis, chemotherapy, and other treatment). Consent was reviewed in detail on the telephone
with the participant. Signed consent forms were mailed
back to the research coordinator and a time was scheduled
for baseline assessment.
Videoconference Study Sites

Twelve videoconference sites were identified for participation, with 11 sites having at least 1 participant. Sites
included cancer outreach clinics and health centers
throughout Maine. Each facility was equipped with a
Tandberg centric 1700 MXP videoconferencing unit
(Tandberg Data, Westminster, Colo) featuring a 20-inch
widescreen LCD monitor, high-definition camera, and
audio transmission and signal encryption. A local study
coordinator assisted each participant with connection to
the clinician and helped assure privacy (eg, a quiet room
in which the door could be closed).
Treatment: MAAT and ST
Memory and Attention Adaptation Training

MAAT is a CBT consisting of 8 weekly visits of 30 to 45
minutes each. The objective of MAAT is to optimize behavioral, cognitive, and emotional adaptation to living
with CRCD.18,19 MAAT therefore helps to increase
awareness of at-risk situations, build skills to prevent
memory failures, or reduce the emotional and functional
impact of these failures. This is in contrast to computerized cognitive rehabilitation such as repetitive practice of
cognitive exercises that may not be generalizable to daily
life. The 4 MAAT components include: 1) education concerning CRCD (to reduce misattribution of all daily
memory failure to chemotherapy and raise the possibility
that stress or inattention also contribute to memory problems); 2) self-awareness training to identify “at-risk” situations in which cognitive failures may occur; 3) stress
management and self-regulation (eg, relaxation training,
cognitive restructuring, activity pacing, and sleep quality
improvement); and 4) cognitive compensatory strategies
training (self-instructional training, verbal rehearsal, visualization strategies, keeping an organized schedule, and
active listening to enhance verbal-auditory encoding). A
detailed clinician’s manual was used to standardize clini1784

cian behavior and a survivor’s workbook was provided to
all BCS to reinforce learning during visits.20,21 MAAT
was delivered by one of us (R.J.F.) with audio recordings
of visits reviewed by a third party to ensure adherence to
the MAAT manual.
Supportive therapy

ST controls for nonspecific psychotherapeutic factors of
the clinician-participant alliance, empathy, support, and
warmth14 while not providing the active behavior change
training contained within MAAT (“behavioral placebo”).
A manual for ST used in other research, including the prevention of mild cognitive decline in older patients, was
adapted for the current study.22 ST emphasizes reflective
listening and summarization to help deepen knowledge of
the survivor’s emotional experience with a focus on concerns regarding cognitive dysfunction. Identical to
MAAT, ST consisted of 8 visits of 30 to 45 minutes each
and was delivered by a trained clinician (S.T.S.).
Outcome Measures
FACT-Cog

The primary self-report outcome measures used were 2
subscales (Perceived Cognitive Impairments [PCI] and
Perceived Cognitive Abilities of the FACT-Cog).12 The
PCI subscale assesses perceived memory and attention
problems over the previous 7 days, rated on a scale of 0
(never) to 4 (several times a day) (eg, “I have trouble
remembering the name of an object while talking to someone”). The Perceived Cognitive Abilities subscale evaluates perceived abilities over the past 7 days, rated on a
scale of 0 (not at all) to 4 (very much) (eg, “I have been
able to concentrate”).
Telephone-Based Neuropsychological Assessment

The current trial used the Telephone-Based Assessment of
Neuropsychological Status (TBANS).23 The TBANS was
originally normed on BCS living in rural Indiana and
allows participants to complete assessment from home.
Unverzagt et al found no statistically significant test-retest
or group performance differences between telephone and
in-person TBANS administration, suggesting the TBANS
is a reliable telephone-based assessment of processing
speed and verbal memory.23 Processing speed was assessed
by the Symbol Digit Modalities Test,24 in which participants use a symbol-number key to verbally match numbers with a presentation of geometric figures. The
California Verbal Learning Test-II (CVLT-II)25 was used
to assess verbal memory. In this task, participants are read
a word list and asked to recall items immediately and after
Cancer

a brief verbal distraction task. For telephone administration, participants were mailed stimulus materials (ie, the
Symbol Digit form) before testing. Instruction was provided regarding the importance of not writing on the
forms to maintain assessment validity. The examiner rated
participant comfort, cooperation, and difficulty after each
assessment. Unusual circumstances that could impact performance validity also were noted (eg, difficulty hearing,
frequent interruptions, abnormal performance such as
perfect recall), but no anomalies were observed in this
trial. We used alternate forms for the CVLT-II to help
reduce the effects of practice on verbal memory. Intelligence quotient (IQ) was estimated based on demographic
variables as indexed by Barona et al.26
Several other measures were used to evaluate aspects
of QOL, including anxiety associated with cognitive
problems (Metamemory in Adulthood-Anxiety scale
[MIA-A]),27 fatigue (Functional Assessment of Chronic
Illness Therapy-Fatigue [FACIT-F]),28 self-reported
function (FACT-General [FACT-G]),29 and general anxiety and depression (Depression Anxiety Stress Scales-21
[DASS-21]).30
Treatment Credibility, Fidelity, and Satisfaction
Credibility/expectancy questionnaire

The credibility/expectancy questionnaire (CEQ) is a 6item scale commonly used in RCTs of behavioral interventions to assess participants’ beliefs regarding treatment
credibility and expectations. The CEQ has good evidence
of validity and reliability.31
Treatment fidelity

All MAAT treatment visits were audio recorded to assess
treatment fidelity in the current small trial.32 We did not
evaluate ST fidelity. Treatment fidelity is defined as
MAAT being delivered as intended and clinician adherence to the MAAT treatment manual. Approximately
25% of audio recordings of visits were randomly selected
so that the clinician would have no knowledge of which
visit was to be reviewed. An independent rater reviewed
recordings and rated adherence on a scale of 0 to 10 with
0 indicating “no (poor) fidelity” and 10 indicating
“highest fidelity possible” of specific clinician behaviors
on fidelity rating forms in the MAAT manual.
Treatment satisfaction

Participants rated general satisfaction with treatment on a
9-point (0-8) Likert-type scale (from 0 indicating “not at
all satisfied” to 8 indicating “completely satisfied”). Participants rated general satisfaction (MAAT or ST), how
Cancer

satisfied they were that the treatment helped to improve
memory, and how well it helped them to compensate for
memory problems.
Statistical Analysis

Data analyses included computing descriptive statistics
concerning demographic variables and primary outcomes
to evaluate normalcy of distribution. We also examined
potential baseline differences between groups with regard
to demographic variables that could influence neurocognitive outcomes such as age, IQ, education, and time since
last chemotherapy. The main hypotheses were tested with
analysis of covariance with the baseline score as the covariate and testing separately for group differences at the posttreatment and 2-month follow-up time points. Standard
differences in effect sizes (Cohen’s d) were calculated and
reported on outcomes.
RESULTS
Sample Characteristics
Study enrollment

A total of 152 BCS made inquiries to learn about the
study. Of these, 80 BCS were ineligible for screening (Fig.
1). Reasons for ineligibility included individuals with cancers other than breast cancer, patients were still engaged in
active cancer treatment, or the presence of a preexisting
neurological problem (eg, brain injury). Fourteen BCS
could not be contacted for screening, 6 could not commit
time or declined screening, and 5 lived too far from a videoconference site. A total of 47 participants met the entry
criteria, were enrolled in the study, and completed written
consent. Twenty-seven participants were randomized to
MAAT whereas 20 were enrolled in ST. This distribution
was the result of random effects of electronic randomization and there were no measures taken to make the distribution equal in this small study. Over the course of the
study, 7 participants dropped out of ST and 5 withdrew
from MAAT. Reasons for withdrawal included an inability to commit time, personal problems (eg, family illness),
or moving. The final sample for analyses was 22 participants for MAAT and 13 participants for ST.
Demographic, diagnosis, and treatment
information

There were no significant differences noted between
MAAT and ST participants with regard to age, education,
or IQ (Table 1).28 The entire study sample was white.
With respect to breast cancer diagnosis and staging,
25.7% of the participants (9 participants) were diagnosed
with stage I disease, 54.3% (19 participants) with stage II

disease, and 20% (7 participants) with stage IIIA breast
cancer. BCS participants had a wide variety of chemotherapy agents with 28 of 35 participants (80%) having
received various combination therapies with cyclophosphamide. Approximately 75% of participants were receiving hormonal therapy at the time of the study. The Fisher
exact test demonstrated that participants receiving hormonal therapy were distributed evenly between MAAT and
ST (P 5 1.0). Eleven MAAT participants receiving hormonal therapy (64.7%) were receiving aromatase inhibitors (AIs), whereas 5 ST participants receiving hormonal
therapy (50%) were receiving AIs. This difference in proportions was not statistically significant (P 5 .69, Fisher
exact test). Moreover, to the best of our knowledge,
1786

research is inconsistent regarding the extent to which AIs
influence cognitive function16,33 and thus the type of hormonal therapy likely had no influence on outcomes.
Main Outcomes
Perceived cognitive impairments

The primary hypothesis for the FACT-Cog PCI scale was
supported at the 2-month follow-up point. Adjusting for
baseline scores, there was a trend at posttreatment in the
expected direction for PCI (F (1,28), 3.05; P 5 .09) (Fig.
2), but there was a significant difference between the
MAAT and ST groups at the 2-month follow-up (F
(1,28), 6.07; P 5 .02), with a medium effect (d 5 0.52;
see Table 2).

Neuropsychological test outcomes

After adjusting for baseline scores, there was a significant
difference noted between the MAAT and ST groups at
the posttreatment time point on the Symbol Digit (processing speed) subtest of the TBANS (F (1,32), 5.25; P 5
.03) (Fig. 3). The effect size was d 5 0.50. The 2-month
follow-up difference was not statistically significant (F
(1,32), 2.45; P 5 .127). With respect to verbal memory
(CVLT-II total score), there were no differences noted
between groups at the posttreatment (F (1,32), 0.042; P
5 .84) or 2-month follow-up (F (1,32), 0.050; P 5 .825)
time points.
Quality of life

With respect to anxiety about cognitive problems in daily
life (MIA-A), the MAAT and ST participants did not differ at the posttreatment follow-up time point (F (1,28),
0.089; P 5 .77). However, at 2-month follow-up, there

was a trend toward MAAT participants having decreased
anxiety regarding cognitive problems (F (1,28), 3.53; P 5
.07), with a large effect size noted (d 5 .90; Fig. 4). This
suggests that MAAT participants continued to build coping skills beyond the cessation of clinician interaction,
which is consistent with treatment design. On the FACTCog Impact on Quality of Life scale, MAAT and ST participants did not differ at the posttreatment (F (1,28),
0.187; P 5 .67) or 2-month follow-up (F (1,28), 1.19; P
5 .28) time points, but a moderate effect size was
observed at the 2-month follow-up, with MAAT participants reporting higher QOL (d 5 0.43). On other QOL
measures, MAAT and ST participants did not differ with
regard to general function at either the posttreatment (F
(1,28), 0.236; P 5 .63) or 2-month follow-up (F (1,28),
1.14; P 5 .295) time points. MAAT and ST participants
did not differ with regard to fatigue (FACIT-F) at the
posttreatment (F (1,28), 0.072; P 5 .79) or 2-month

statistically significant differences, with MAAT rating
higher credibility: 1) “how logical does the therapy
offered to you seem?” (MAAT: mean (m), 8.09 [SD, 0.8]
and ST: m, 05.4 [SD, 2.80]; F (1,30), 9.54 [P<.01]);
and 2) “how confident would you be in recommending
this treatment to a friend who experiences similar problems?” (MAAT: m, 8.4 [SD, 0.90] and ST: m, 5.2 [SD,
2.80]; F (1,31), 16.45 [P<.001]). There were no
between-group differences noted with regard to any of
the 4 remaining CEQ items.

The mean fidelity rating of randomly selected MAAT
audio-recorded visits was 8.58 (SD, 1.73), in which 0
indicated no or poor fidelity and 10 indicated the highest
fidelity possible. This indicates that MAAT was closely
adhered to.
Satisfaction

follow-up (F (1,28), 2.35; P 5 .14) time points and did
not differ with regard to general anxiety (DASS-21-anxiety) at the posttreatment (F (1,28), 0.271; P 5 .61) or 2month follow-up (F (1,28), 1.42; P 5 .24) time points.
However, the Cohen’s d effect sizes for function, fatigue,
and anxiety at the 2-month follow-up time point suggested that MAAT participants demonstrated sustained
clinical gains on these QOL measures compared with ST
participants (general function, 0.50; fatigue, 0.46; and
DASS-21 anxiety scale, 0.55). MAAT and ST participants
did differ at a statistically significant level with regard to
depression at baseline (Table 1). This suggests that ST
participants were more depressed and thus could have had
more cognitive problems affecting results. However, it is
interesting to note that ST participants were slightly
higher on FACT-Cog PCI (fewer cognitive symptoms) at
baseline compared with MAAT participants and there
were no significant differences noted between MAAT and
ST participants regarding depression at the posttreatment
(F (1,28), 0.54; P 5 .47) or 2-month follow-up (F (1,28),
0.003; P 5 .96) time points. Moreover, DASS-21 depression scores were within normal clinical ranges at each time
point for both MAAT and ST participants based on a general population sample,34 suggesting a nonclinically significant baseline difference.
Treatment Credibility, Fidelity, and Satisfaction
Treatment credibility

Perceptions of credibility for each treatment condition
were assessed by the CEQ. Two CEQ items achieved
1788

MAAT participants reported higher satisfaction ratings
than ST participants with regard to 3 satisfaction items at
both the posttreatment and 2-month follow-up periods
(P value range,.003-.05, 2-tailed Student t tests). Consistent with previous research, MAAT participants rated
MAAT as more helpful in compensating for cognitive
problems rather than improving cognitive performance. It
is interesting to note that both the MAAT and ST groups
reported highest satisfaction with videoconference treatment delivery. Finally, despite high satisfaction, 75% of
MAAT participants indicated at the 2-month follow-up
that they would not have engaged in treatment without
videoconferencing.
DISCUSSION
The results of this small RCT demonstrate that BCS who
underwent a brief videoconference CBT (MAAT) made
significant gains in self-reported cognitive impairments
and cognitive processing speed compared with BCS who
underwent an attention control treatment (ST). MAAT
produced positive gains over ST at the 2-month follow-up
period, with medium to stronger effect sizes regarding
anxiety about cognitive symptoms in daily life (MIA-A),
general function, fatigue, and anxiety although only the
MIA-A result was near statistical significance (P 5 .07).
This suggests that ST was an effective “placebo” that controlled for therapeutic nonspecific factors in survivorclinician interactions, but BCS completing MAAT likely
continued to practice, apply, and master the coping skills
learned beyond clinician interaction, thereby leading to
gains at the posttreatment follow-up. This result is

consistent with the design of MAAT, in which the emphasis is on learning and applying adaptive coping behaviors
to daily life situations in which memory is used. This is in
contrast to simple cognitive training interventions that
emphasize repetitive practice, such as online computer
training, which may lack the ability to be generalized to
daily task performance.

The current study sample of BCS reported high satisfaction with MAAT and with the convenience and use
of videoconferencing and indicated that they are likely to
recommend MAAT to other BCS. Moreover, a majority
reported they would not seek treatment for cognitive dysfunction if it entailed travel to the cancer center, suggesting that using communications technology can improve
1789

care access. To our knowledge, this is the first RCT targeting the treatment of CRCD with an active control condition and one that uses telecommunications delivery.
In contrast to previous MAAT research, MAAT participants in the current study did not appear to make
improvements in verbal memory compared with ST controls. ST participants scored higher than MAAT participants at all 3 study time points and thus made few verbal
memory gains over time. MAAT participants made gains
over time but never achieved the average verbal memory
scores of ST participants. Given the small sample size, this
was likely due to randomization and ceiling effects of
verbal memory performance among the ST participants.
More research with a larger study sample and distributing
equal verbal memory performances between groups at
baseline should be considered in future research.
The inclusion of an ST control condition was an
improvement over previous MAAT research. The effect of
therapeutic attention in the ST condition was demonstrated
in self-report outcomes that would logically improve with
empathic listening and attention, but also deteriorate toward
baseline or stagnate at the 2-month follow-up period
because therapeutic attention was withdrawn. By contrast,
the learning and mastery of compensatory coping skills that
are part of MAAT would be expected to have positive effects
on outcomes at follow-up even after therapeutic contact
ends. This was the case with the main outcomes, especially
FACT-Cog PCI. The results of the current study demonstrated that ST was a good “placebo control” for therapeutic
attention, but that without the instruction and mastery of
skills contained within MAAT, ST participants did not continue to improve.
It is interesting to note that ST participants at baseline had higher depression scores than MAAT participants. It is possible that depressive symptoms led to more
cognitive symptoms in ST than MAAT participants over
the course of the study, thereby explaining positive
MAAT outcomes. However, MAAT participants actually
reported slightly more cognitive impairment (lower PCI
and CVLT-II scores) at baseline than ST participants.
Furthermore, although the baseline DASS-21 depression
scores were statistically significant between MAAT and
ST participants, both groups scored within the normal
range of general population samples.34 Differences in
depression between MAAT and ST participants were perhaps not clinically meaningful and thus had little effect on
the main outcomes. Nevertheless, future research with a
larger sample size with ample power to evaluate the relative effects of emotional distress on MAAT outcomes with
multilevel modeling could help determine therapeutic
1790

contributions of MAAT components (eg, education, selfawareness, compensatory strategy training, and stress
management components).
Attrition of self-report data was a limitation of the
current study. All participants completed telephone-based
neuropsychological tests because they were administered by
the psychometrist with immediate collection of data. However, self-report forms were mailed to participants, who
then mailed the forms back to the psychometrist. Two participants in each group did not return follow-up self-report
forms and thus some missing data potentially biased
results. Research regarding remote CBT for CRCD should
include the electronic administration of self-report measures that could enhance data completeness.
The small sample size of the current study limits its
statistical power and the generalizability of the observed
results. We chose to present effect sizes on the most clinically relevant outcomes to avoid “file drawing” or dismissing results that were generally favorable in support of
MAAT efficacy. Nevertheless, replication of the current
study using a larger sample with multiple clinicians and
multiple sites would greatly strengthen the overall confidence in results. The current study sample also was limited to white, female BCS and therefore the
generalizability of the results to other ethnic groups, men,
and survivors of other cancers is limited. Future MAAT
research should target more diverse samples in terms of
sex, ethnic identity, and type of cancer.
An overall encouraging result of this small RCT is
the high satisfaction ratings noted with MAAT videoconference delivery. As the cancer survivorship population
continues to grow, access to cancer survivorship services,
including treatment of CRCD, will be in greater demand.5
A large challenge to survivors with late effects of disease
and treatment is travel burden, which disrupts work and
family life.9 Use of communications technology can greatly
reduce this burden and improve access to psychosocial
interventions for cancer survivors. As a non-drug, brief
psychological treatment that can produce self-report and
neuropsychological gains, MAAT has high potential to be
a viable treatment alternative for many cancer survivors.
