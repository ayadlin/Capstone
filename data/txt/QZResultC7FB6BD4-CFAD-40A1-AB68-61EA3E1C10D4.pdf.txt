BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to examine the combined effect of diffusing alpha-emitter
radiation therapy (DART) together with the chemotherapeutic agent cisplatin on tumor development.
METHODS: BALB/c mice bearing squamous cell carcinoma tumors were treated with radium 224 (224Ra-)–
loaded stainless steel wires, releasing short-lived, alpha-emitting atoms from their surface. A concomitant
regimen of cisplatin doses (5 mg/kg per dose) was given intravenously for the evaluation of the combined
effect. Animals were monitored for tumor growth and survival. RESULTS: First, the authors observed that
alpha particles and cisplatin inhibited SQ2 cell proliferation in vitro and promoted apoptosis. Treatment of
tumor-bearing mice indicated that, when a regimen of 2 separate doses of cisplatin was given concomitantly with a single intratumoral 224Ra-loaded wire, there was moderate tumor growth inhibition relative to
what was observed from each treatment alone. When tumors were treated with 2 radioactive wires positioned near the tumor base and a similar drug administration, the growth arrest effect intensified, and there
also was a significant increase in survival rates. The combined treatment reduced both local tumor growth
and metastatic spread to the lungs. CONCLUSIONS: Antitumor activity and overall survival of metastatic
tumor-bearing mice were improved significantly by the combined treatment. These results highlight the
potential benefit of alpha radiation-based radiotherapy in combination with chemotherapeutic drugs for

(radiosensitization) or to prevent normal tissue toxicity
(radioprotection).2 When used concurrently with radiation therapy, cisplatin (CP) acts as a radiosensitizer, and
such treatment of advanced head and neck squamous cell
carcinoma (HNSCC) achieved higher response rates, prolonged mean survival, and increased survival rates and was
characterized by longer local recurrence-free survival rates
and improved organ preservation.3 The combination of
low-linerar energy transfer (LET) (x-rays, gamma rays)
radiation therapy (RT) and platinum derivatives is a common anticancer strategy4-6 and achieves a better antitumor
effect compared with each modality alone.7,8 CP has been
described as an apoptosis enhancer that cross-links cellular
DNA, forming bifunctional adducts with the N7 of guanine bases,9 and reportedly is remarkably effective when
combined with RT in several different malignancies,
including both small cell and nonsmall cell lung carcinoma, lymphoma, and head and neck carcinomas.10-12
Over 60 clinical trials that were conducted before
1993 indicated a 12% reduction in the risk of death from
HNSCC when patients were treated with both definitive
and postoperative chemoradiotherapy (CRT) involving
CP.7 Moreover, for patients who had carcinomas with a
poor prognosis, adjuvant, postoperative, high-dose CP
and irradiation given concomitantly resulted in better
control of locoregional disease and disease-free survival
than postoperative RT alone.13
In recent years, with the use of low-LET alongside
traditional external RT, increasingly, more attention has
been attracted toward the use of RT methods with highLET.14-16 This approach calls for studies on the biologic
effects created by the combined use of DNA-affecting
agents. such as CP and high-LET RT. Because CP sensitizes cells to ionizing radiation mainly by inhibition of the
nonhomologous end-joining pathway (for DNA repair of
double-strand breaks), and because a considerable fraction
of double-strand breaks induced by high-LET particles
are repairable, the combination of these 2 treatments
potentially may achieve enhanced anticancer effects.17,18
Alpha particles are a form of high-LET radiation.
Only a few hits of alpha particles to the nucleus usually
are required to ensure cell death, including in hypoxic cell
populations.19,20 It is believed that the mechanisms by
which cell death is initiated involve both apoptosis and
necrosis, depending on numerous biologic and physical
factors like the cell type, the microenvironment, and the
1792

characteristics of the DNA lesions formed by the particles.21,22 Unlike photon- or electron-based RT, very
little is known about the antitumor potential of the combination of CP and alpha-based RT, although there is an
increasing number of studies dealing with the role of alpha
particles in anticancer treatment modalities.23,24
In previous studies. we described a novel technique,
termed diffusing alpha-emitter RT (DART), using the
characteristics of the radium 224 (224Ra) alpha decay
chain for the treatment of solid tumors. It was reported
that the intratumoral insertion of thin wires loaded with
224
Ra into SCC tumors promoted extensive local alpha
radiation through decay products and subsequent tumor
growth inhibition and improved animal survival
rates.25,26 The objective of the current work was to evaluate the possible synergism between the intratumoral alpha
radiation treatment that we developed and the traditional,
potent, radiosensitizing drug, CP,27 against SCC-derived
tumors.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Tumors
The SQ2 cell line28 was kindly provided by Dr. Gad Lavie
from the Sheba Medical Center, Tel-Hashomer, Israel.
This is a murine anaplastic cell line and was generated
from an SCC tumor that developed spontaneously in a
male BALB/c mouse. The tumor was characterized and
determined as SCC at the Pathology Institute of Sheba
Medical Center. The cells were grown in Dulbecco Modified Eagle Medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf
serum (Biological Industries, Beit Haemek, Israel), L-glutamine (2 mM), penicillin (100 U/mL), and streptomycin
(100 lg/mL).

Radioactive Microplates
An experimental setup was developed to implant 224Ra on
the bottom of 96-well microplates (Corning, Corning,
NY). The implantation was performed inside a vacuum
chamber using an 8-headed ‘stamp’ that fit a single column of the microplate, and each head carried a small
amount of thorium 228 (228Th) activity. The 224Ra activity implanted in each well was controlled by the time of
exposure to the 228Th stamps.

FIGURE 1. (A,B) The kapton well apparatus.

Cell Proliferation Assay
The antiproliferative effects of alpha particles and CP,
alone and in combination, were determined using a 3-bis
(2 methoxy-4 nitro-5 sulfenyl)-(2H)-tetrazolium-5-carboxanilide (XTT) assay (Cell Proliferation Kit; Biological
Industries). Cells (104 per well) were seeded in 96-well
microplates that were implanted with escalating levels
of 224Ra activity (radioactive microplates). Cells were
allowed to grow for the required period; then, the activated XTT mixture was added to a final concentration of
0.33 mg/mL according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
After 2 hours of incubation, absorbance was analyzed
using an automated spectrophotometer (VersaMax; Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, Calif) at 475 nm wavelength.

Kapton Wells Setup
Cells seeded on a thin (7.5 lm) kapton (polyimide) foil
were irradiated by alpha particles traversing the foil from
below. The setup (see scheme in Fig. 1) was comprised of
2 stainless-steel rings that were identical in diameter
(35 mm) with a center hole of 9 mm. One of the rings was
3 mm high, and the second ring was 12 mm high. The
kapton foil (Dupont, Luxembourg) was placed between
the 2 rings (with the 12-mm ring on top) covering the
hole; then, the rings were screwed tightly with a rubber
O-ring to ensure impermeability (Fig. 1A). After ultraviolet light sterilization of the wells for at least 1 hour, cells
were seeded on the foil at a density of 5  104 cells per well
and were exposed to the alpha particle flux 24 hours later.
Exposure was performed by positioning the cells seeded
on the foil 9.8 mm above a silicon wafer coated with a
thin layer of 4.0 lCi (148 kBq) 228Th in secular equilibrium with its daughters in air (Fig. 1B). The total alpha
particle flux across the kapton foil was measured by an
EG&G solid-state alpha particle detector (EG&:G
Cancer

ORTEC, Oak Ridge, Tenn). Exposure times were
0 minutes, 1 minute, and 3 minutes, and the average flux
was 2.8  104 alpha particles/mm2  miniutes across the
exposed area. The calculated average dose rate, which was
based on a Monte-Carlo calculation (not shown) and was
performed using the SRIM-2003 code,29 was 0.75 
0.05 grays (Gy) per minute. The variations of the average
dose rate across the irradiated area were on the order of
10% to 15%.
For detection of the fraction of apoptotic, cells we
used the annexin-V/phosphatidyl inositol (PI) assay
(MBL, Naka-ku Nagoya, Japan). SQ2 cells were seeded in
kapton wells, as described above, and treated either with
CP, or alpha particle flux, or a combination of both
modalities. Four hours after any treatment, cells were
collected using trypsin and washed once with phosphatebuffered saline (PBS) followed by another wash with
binding buffer. The cells were incubated with 10 lL
annexin-V–fluorescein isothiocyanate and 5 lL PI in the
dark for 15 minutes and analyzed in a flow cytometer
(Facsort, Becton Dickinson, NJ).

Western Immunoblotting
Cells were washed with PBS and lysed with lysis buffer
(50 mmol/L Tris-HCl, pH 7.6; 20 mmol/L MgCl2;
200 mmol/LNaCl; 0.5% NP40; 1 mmol/L dithiothreitol;
and 1 mmol/L antiproteases). Lysates were subjected to
sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, followed by immunoblotting with 1:1000 anticleaved
caspase-3 antibody. Then, the immunoblots were exposed
to 1:5000 peroxidase/goat-antirabbit immunoglobulin G,
and protein bands were observed by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) and quantified by densitometry with an
Image Master VDS-CL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech,
Arlington Heights, Ill) using TINA 2.0 software (Ray
Tests). The ECL kit was obtained from Amersham.

Animals
Male BALB/c mice (8-12 weeks old) were obtained from
the breeding colony of Tel-Aviv University, Israel. Animal
care and experimentation was carried out in accordance
with Tel-Aviv University guidelines. All surgical and invasive procedures were conducted under anesthesia by intraperitoneal inoculation of Imalgen (100 mg/kg;; Fort

hydrochloride (10 mg/kg; VMD, Arendonk, Belgium) solution in 0.25 mL of PBS.
Tumor Cell Inoculation
Animals were inoculated intracutaneously with 5  105
SQ2 cells in 0.2 mL Hank Balanced Salt Solution (Biological Industries) into the low lateral side of the back.
Local tumor growth was determined by measuring 3
mutually orthogonal tumor dimensions with a digital caliper (Mitutoyo, Onomy, Japan). The volume of tumor
was calculated using the formula: V ¼ (p/6)  D1,D2,D3,
where D1, D2, and D3 indicate the measured dimensions.

Ra-Loaded Wire (Diffusing
Alpha-Emitter Radiation Therapy Wire)
Preparation

224

Ra-loaded wires were prepared using a 228Th generator
(as described in detail by Arazi et al25). In this setup, positive 224Ra ions that were emitted by recoil from a surface
layer containing 228Th were collected electrostatically near
the tip of a thin stainless-steel wire (0.3 mm in diameter;
Golden Needle, Suzhou, China). Then, the wires were
heat-treated to induce radium diffusion away from the surface to a typical depth of 10 nm. The 224Ra-impregnated
wires then were characterized by an alpha particle detector
to account for their 224Ra activity and the release rate of
radon 220 (220Rn). The wires that were used in the in vivo
experiments had 224Ra activity in the range of 11.5 to 29.7
kBq with 220Rn desorption probabilities of 22% to 36%
(ie, for each 224Ra decay on the wire, the probability of
220
Rn release into the tumor was 22%-36%).
Wire Insertion
Wires, either loaded with 224Ra or inert, that were cut to a
length of 5-6 mm were placed near the tip of a 23-gauge
needle attached to a 2.5 mL syringe (Picindolor, Rome,
Italy) and inserted into the tumor by a plunger placed
internally along the syringe axis.
Histology
Histologic analysis was performed on BALB/c mice lungs,
both treated and untreated. Immediately after their
1794

removal, the lungs were fixed in a 4% formaldehyde solution (Sigma, Rehovot, Israel) for at least 24 hours. The
preserved specimens were embedded in paraffin, and sections (5-10 lm) were stained with hematoxylin and eosin
(Surgipath, Richmond, Va) and inspected for metastases.
Metastatic burden quantification was done by summing
the gray values of all pixels in the region of interest divided
by the number of pixels using Image J free software (available at: http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/ accessed January 25,
2009).
Statistical Analysis
The statistical significance (P value) of the differences
between tumor volumes in the various groups was assessed
by applying using a 2-sided Student t test and a repeatedmeasures analysis of variance. Survival analysis (MantelCox test) was carried out using StatSoft Statistica 7.

RESULTS
Combined Alpha Particles and Cisplatin
Enhanced Cell Death and Arrested
Proliferation in Culture
SQ2 cells were plated in 96-well plates implanted with
224
Ra atoms (0, 0.02, 0.063, 0.2, 0.63, and 2 Bq/mm2
radioactive microplates). For each radioactive dose, 3 concentrations of CP were added to the microplate (0.3, 3,
and 30 lM) to determine whether cells that received both
treatments would be affected more compared with cells
that received each treatment alone. Cell numbers were
assessed by the XTT assay after 24, 48, and 72 hours of
incubation and are expressed as the percentage of nontreated control cells. Substantial proliferation arrest
caused by alpha irradiation alone was detected after
48 hours, and the effect intensified after 72 hours (Fig. 2).
A dose-dependent inhibition for cell growth effect was
observed and ranged from 18% in wells that were exposed
to 0.63 Bq/mm2 up to 52% inhibition in 2 Bq/mm2 wells
that were incubated for 72 hours. A similar but stronger
antiproliferative effect was observed for cells that were
incubated with 0.3 lM CP and radioactivity. A higher
proliferation inhibition, as illustrated in Figure 2, was evident after 48 hours and after 72 hours. Cells that were
exposed to 0.2 Bq/mm2 for 72 hours demonstrated 18%
inhibition, and 0.3 lM of CP caused 21% inhibition.

A time course measurement of the expression levels of
cleaved caspase-3 was conducted in SQ2 cells that were
exposed to 1.5 Gy of alpha irradiation to assure that these
cells die through apoptosis. Figure 3 shows that apoptosis
mechanisms are initiated immediately postirradiation in a
process that remains intensified 2 to 4 hours after the
treatment. A similar examination was dedicated to determine the optimal apoptosis-enhancing concentration of
CP, which was set at 30 lM (data not shown). Apoptotic
cell death was monitored by the annexin-V dye-binding
assay. Cells were costained with propidium iodide, which
permeates into dead cells, to distinguish apoptotic cells

all treated cultures. Less than 16% of untreated cells
stained positive with annexin-V, and only a moderate
increase was detected for cells that were irradiated with
0.75 Gy (19%). When cells were exposed to 2.25 Gy or
to CP alone, more apoptosis occurred (22%-23% of
cells stained positive with annexin-V). Furthermore,
when chemotherapy and alpha-radiation were applied
together, the apoptotic fraction increased for both radioactivity dose levels (27% for CP and 0.75 Gy; 41% CP
and 2.25 Gy).
A Single 224Ra-Loaded Wire Insertion
Combined With 2 Cisplatin Treatments
Moderately Retarded Tumor Growth
SQ2 tumors in BALB/c mice were implanted with a
Ra-loaded wire in combination with CP given intravenously. The 224Ra-loaded wire treatment was performed
as tumors reached the average size of 6 to7 mm in greatest
dimension. The chemotherapeutic agent was injected in
2 separate doses of 5 mg/kg per animal—the first dose was
administrated 1 day before 224Ra-loaded wire treatment,
and the second dose was given 5 days later. Inert (nonradioactive) wires that were identical in shape to the radioactive wires were used as controls. The outcome of this line
of experiments (Fig. 5) suggests that both a radiation and
chemotherapy (the 224Ra wire and CP groups) contribute
to tumor growth retardation as stand-alone treatments.
Average tumor volumes 30 days after tumor transplantation were very similar for both treatment groups (48%51% for the inert control group). The average tumor
volumes in mice that received the combined treatment
(224Ra wire þ CP), were smaller relative to the volumes in
mice that received each treatment alone (40% for the inert
control group on Day 30), but the differences were not
statistically significant (P values between the combination
group and the CP or 224Ra wire groups were .054 and
.105, respectively).

of 2 224Ra-loaded wires inserted horizontally into the base
of each tumor in combination with 2 doses of chemotherapy. The double 224Ra-loaded wire insertion had a prominent effect on tumor development, as shown in Figure
6A. A pronounced difference between tumor volumes of
the irradiated group (224Ra wires) and the CP-treated animals was evolving 10 days after radioactive treatment.
This difference became more evident with time; and, 32
days after tumor cell inoculation, the average tumor volume in the CP-treated group was 2.14-fold greater than
the average tumor volume in the 224Ra-treated group.
Moreover, major growth inhibition of tumors was
achieved when both modalities, CP and 224Ra wires, were
administrated concomitantly. Greater than 50% of the
animals in the combination group had tumor retardation
at some point of the monitoring, with complete tumor
eradication in 1 animal. Twenty-four days after 224Ra
treatment, the average tumor volume in the combined
treatment group was 14-fold smaller compared with the
average tumor volume in the inert control group (300

Insertion of 2 224Ra-Loaded Wires
Combined With 2 Cisplatin Doses
Significantly Reduced Metastatic Load
in the Lungs
Tumor-bearing mice were treated with 2 radioactive
wires, or with 2 CP injections, or with both. Twenty-six
days after tumor transplantation, as the average tumor size
of the inert control group exceeded 2 cm (greatest dimension), the mice were killed, and histologic assessment of
lung metastases in tissue sections26 was conducted. Each
of the 4 groups (inert, 224Ra wires, CP, and CP þ 224Ra
wires) contained 3 animals, and normal lung tissues were
taken from healthy BALB/c mice. Figure 7 describes the
inhibition of lung metastatic load in mice that were
treated with both intratumoral alpha radiation and CP
compared with the lungs from mice that were treated with
inert wires. Both treatments given alone (CP or 224Raloaded wires) also decreased metastatic burden although
to a smaller extent than the combined treatment.

DISCUSSION
We investigated the combined anticancer effects of a commonly used chemotherapeutic agent with a novel technique based on the release of alpha-emitting daughters of
224
Ra. Both in vitro and in vivo examinations were done
to assess the collaboration between CP and intratumoral
dispersed radioactive atoms against SCC-derived tumors.
In vitro experiments indicated that treatment of
SCC cells with CP for 4 hours initiated apoptotic cell
death mechanisms and retarded cell proliferation. A similar observation was made when cells were exposed to doses
greater than 0.75 Gy of alpha particle fluxes. When both
treatments were applied concomitantly, enhanced apoptosis and reduced proliferation were detected.
To examine the collaboration between alpha radiation and CP in vivo, tumor-bearing mice were treated
with each treatment modality alone and in combination.
A single 224Ra wire inserted into the center of each tumor,
given together with 2 equal and separate intravenous CP
injections, produced a moderate gain compared with the
effects of chemotherapy or RT administered alone.

In a previous study, it was observed that 2 224Raloaded wires positioned at the tumor base significantly
arrested the growth of primary SCC tumors and reduced
the metastatic process.26 Thus, we combined this efficient
treatment protocol with chemotherapy. The findings
revealed that combined treatment with 2 224Ra-loaded
wires and 2 doses of CP caused extensive tumor retardation in almost all treated mice. The combined treatment
also resulted in substantial prolongation in average life expectancy for this group of mice relative to all other treatments. The enhanced tumor destruction of 2 wires
implanted into the tumor base may have been caused by
the higher radioactive dose delivered to the most aerated
domains of the tissue. This may result in increased distribution of radioactive atoms throughout the tumor on 1
hand and destruction of blood vessels, which irrigate the
periphery of the tumor, on the other hand.
Because BALB/c mice bearing SQ2 tumors die primarily from lung metastases,28 the major increase in life
expectancy induced by the combination of 224Ra-loaded
wires and CP indicated that inhibition of the metastatic
process may be involved. Thus, we examined the metastatic burden in the lungs from untreated and treated mice
and observed that the 224Ra wires þ CP treatment group
attained a significant reduction of 51% in the lung metastatic load compared with the group of inert-treated
animals.
The extensive experimental and clinical knowledge
on the effects of external RT combined with CP can be
deployed to only a limited extent in understanding the
effects of radionuclide therapy, even if it is comprised of
beta particles.30 Furthermore, therapy based on alpha particle dispersion is complicated, because factors like diffusion inside the tissue and the blood vessel network may
play a vital role alongside the macroscopic dose concept.
Although alpha radiation is the most lethal form of
radiation and has the highest LET, its short range in tissue
limited the use of alpha particles in the treatment of cancer to single cells, small cell clusters, or micrometastases
and still is in early clinical trials. To date, alpha irradiation
has been considered unsuitable for external-beam RT of
solid tumors, and brachytherapy was not feasible because
of the lack of a practical treatment modality to effectively
cover the tumor volume with these short-range particles.
DART, for the first time, may provide an efficient
and secure method for prolonged treatment of the entire

volume of solid tumors with a therapeutic dose of alpha
particles. The first clinical indication considered for the
use of DART is the treatment of recurrent HNSCC,
which is a highly prevalent disease with high mortality.
HNSCC tumors are fast growing, hypoxic, and, in many
cases, inoperable when considering the preservation of
organ function and quality of life. Conventional RT therapy (either external beam or brachytherapy) for HNSCC
tumors usually is complicated by the proximity of normal
tissues and organs, such as the spinal cord, brainstem, parotid glands, and optic pathway structures, which inevitably are exposed to high radiation doses and manifest side
effects that include chronic radiation toxicities like mucosal fibrosis, bone necrosis, and atrophy. Not only can
these effects compromise optimal treatment delivery, they
also can lead to a lifetime risk with profound effects on
patient quality of life.
The results described in this study suggest that radionuclides emitting alpha particles could cause more
damage to primary tumors as well as to metastases when
targeted into the tumors and strengthened by an apoptosis-enhancing agent. Because of the finding that CP is not
the only agent that can be used for CRT, the concurrent
treatment of SCC patients with RT and other radiosensitizing agents should be considered. Gemcitabine,31
paclitaxel,32 or concurrent docetaxel and CP with hyperfractionated irradiation33 produced significant antitumor
activity and encouraging preliminary response and survival data. Concomitant CRT is evidently a preferential
treatment for patients who have unresectable SCC.34-37
Alpha radiation in the form of 224Ra-loaded wires
may add a clinical tool to the arsenal of radiotherapy for
SCC and calls for additional research on its combination
with other drugs in addition to CP. The results presented
here indicate that DART coupled with a platinum derivative is an effective treatment against SCC tumors in mice.
The mechanisms by which an apoptosis-triggering agent
like CP can intensify the killing effect that alpha particles
exerts on malignant tissues will be studied further.
