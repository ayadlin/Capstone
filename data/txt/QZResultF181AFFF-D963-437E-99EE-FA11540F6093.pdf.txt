BACKGROUND. The prognosis of patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia
(CML) after failure of imatinib mesylate therapy is not well documented.

METHODS. The outcome of 420 patients with CML post-imatinib failure (resistance-recurrence in 374; toxicities in 46) were reviewed in relation to survival,
overall, and by different therapies.

RESULTS. The estimated 3-year survival rates were 72% in 88 patients who progressed in chronic phase, 30% in 130 patients who progressed in accelerated
phase, 7% in 156 patients who progressed in blastic phase, and 75% in 37
patients in chronic phase with imatinib intolerance. Survival in chronic phase
was better when subsequent therapy was nilotinib or dasatinib vs allogeneic
stem cell transplant vs others (estimated 2-year survival rates 100% vs 72% vs
67%; P ¼ .01), but not in accelerated-blastic phase.
CONCLUSIONS. Prognosis post-imatinib failure in chronic phase is reasonable; it

T

he introduction of imatinib mesylate into the treatment of
patients with Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)-positive chronic
myelogenous leukemia (CML) has changed their prognosis drastically. In newly diagnosed CML, imatinib therapy is associated with
an estimated 5-year survival rate of 90%.1–3 The annual resistance
rate to imatinib has been about 4% in the first 4 years. Prognosis in
CML post-imatinib failure is reported to be poor, but there are no
literature data pertaining to survival, particularly relating to the
phase during which patients progress, and during which subsequent
treatments such as allogeneic stem cell transplant (SCT) or the
new-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors are used. In this regard,
we report the results from our institution.

Study Group
All patients with a diagnosis of CML who received imatinib therapy
since 1999 were analyzed. Patients had been treated on imatinib
protocols after informed consent was obtained according to institutional guidelines.4–7 Patients who were taken off study were analyzed for the reason imatinib was discontinued, their characteristics
including the CML phase for which they received imatinib, and the
phase that they were in at the time imatinib was discontinued. Sub-

sequent therapy was also coded, as to whether they
underwent allogeneic SCT or received one of the
novel bcr-abl inhibitors, dasatinib or nilotinib.8,9

Statistical Considerations
CML phase of disease and responses to imatinib,
dasatinib, or nilotinib was described according to
published criteria.4–7 Differences among variables
were calculated by the chi-square or Wilcoxon tests.
Survival and remission duration curves were developed by the Kaplan-Meier method and compared by
the log-rank test.

RESULTS
A total of 574 patients with CML after failure of imatinib regimens from 1999 until December 2005 were
analyzed. These included 321 patients in chronic
phase, 161 in accelerated phase (including clonal
evolution only), and 92 in blastic phase. These
patients had discontinued imatinib therapy for the
following reasons: hematologic resistance or recurrence, 66 patients; cytogenetic resistance or recurrence, 63; progression to more advanced phases or in
the same advanced phase, 245; imatinib toxicities,
46; choice of allogeneic SCT as a next best treatment
option, 13; death while on imatinib therapy, 14; other
reasons, 127 (outside follow-up, no follow-up available, noncompliance). The outcome of the latter 127
patients (86 in chronic phase, 33 in accelerated
phase, 8 in blastic phase; 24% of total) could not be
retrieved in detail in relation to subsequent therapies
or survival. This may need to be considered in the
interpretation of the data. The analysis next concentrated only on patients in whom imatinib therapy
was discontinued for either clear-cut resistance or recurrence (n ¼ 374), or for imatinib toxicities

(n ¼ 46), as previously defined.3–8 These 420 patients
were then categorized by whether they received imatinib for 1) chronic phase and progressed while in
chronic phase (chronic-chronic), in accelerated
phase (chronic ? accelerated), or in blastic phase
(chronic ? blastic); 2) for accelerated phase and progressed while still in accelerated phase (accelerated
? accelerated) or in blastic phase (accelerated ?
blastic); or 3) for blastic phase. The characteristics of
the study group are shown in Table 1.

Outcome Post-Imatinib Failure
Among 88 patients post-imatinib resistance or recurrence in chronic phase the median survival was not
reached; the estimated 3-year survival rate was 72%
(Fig. 1). Survival was worse in 130 patients who
remained or progressed into an accelerated phase

(3-year survival 30%; Fig. 1) and in 156 patients who
remained or progressed into a blastic phase (3-year
survival 7%; Fig. 1). Survival for the 37 patients taken
off imatinib because of side effects while in chronic
phase was better: the estimated 3-year survival rate
was 75%.
Survival was similar among patients who had
developed accelerated phase whether they started on
imatinib in chronic or accelerated phase (P ¼ .51);
these 2 categories were grouped together (Fig. 1).
Survival in blastic phase was better in patients who
had been in chronic phase on imatinib therapy compared with those who had been in accelerated-blastic
phase (grouped together) (P < .001; Fig. 1).

Outcome by Postimatinib Therapy
Outcome post-imatinib resistance-recurrence failure
in chronic phase is shown in Figure 2A by whether
the patients underwent allogeneic SCT (n ¼ 10),
dasatinib or nilotinib (n ¼ 40), or other therapies
(n ¼ 68). Figure 2B shows the outcome in accelerated phase by subsequent therapy with allogeneic
SCT (n ¼ 5), dasatinib or nilotinib (n ¼ 20), or other
therapies (n ¼ 64). Figure 2C shows the survival in
the 3 respective groups (number of patients 8, 20,
and 95, respectively) who progressed in blastic
phase.

Prognostic Factors for Survival in Patients Postimatinib
Failure While Still in Chronic Phase (Table 2)
Because the prognosis in CML in transformation was
poor, we next focused on the analysis of prognostic
determinants of patients post-imatinib failure in
chronic phase. By univariate analysis, adverse factors
for survival were: the cause of imatinib failure (hematologic vs cytogenetic resistance-recurrence vs
toxicity), splenomegaly, 100% Ph-positivity at start of
therapy, anemia, leukocytosis, thrombocytosis, higher
basophils and blasts percents. By multivariate analysis the independent poor prognostic factors selected
were: splenomegaly (P ¼ .006); and hematologic failure (P ¼ .01). Patients with 0, 1, or 2 adverse factors
had expected 2-year survival rates of 91%, 75%, and
0%, respectively. Although patients receiving dasatinib-nilotinib appear to also do better than other subgroups (Fig. 2A; P ¼ .01), therapy was not selected as
an independent favorable factor for survival with the
short follow-up time of this group; this may change
with longer follow-up.

underwent allogeneic stem cell transplant (SCT), dasatinib or nilotinib, or
other regimens for chronic (A), accelerated (B), or blastic phases (C).

Whereas the prognosis of CML post-imatinib failure
has been suspected to be poor, there are no pub-

lished data that estimate such a prognosis. This is
important for patient-physician decision-making, as
well as to establish individual patient expectations,
and to assess the benefit of newer therapies. This
analysis is the first to provide survival estimates
post-imatinib failure. As expected, prognosis for
patients who progress in accelerated or blastic
phases is poor, the median survivals being 16
months and 5 months, respectively. Prognosis is better for patients who received dasatinib or nilotinib vs
allogeneic SCT vs other therapies for chronic phase
(P ¼ .01) but not in more advanced phases.

Surprisingly, patients with CML failure on imatinib in chronic phase still have a relatively good prognosis, with an estimated 3-year survival rate of 72%.
Of interest, the 46 patients with imatinib failure
because of toxicities also had an estimated 3-year
survival rate of 75% (expected to be better). This may
be due to the short follow-up time. Not unexpectedly, patients with imatinib toxicity or cytogenetic resistance or recurrence have a better prognosis than
those with hematologic resistance or recurrence.
Patients treated in recent studies with newer tyrosine
kinase inhibitors appear to also have a better prog-

nosis. A multivariate analysis identified 2 simple
adverse prognostic factors that could estimate
patient prognosis by presence or absence of 0, 1, or
2 adverse factors: the estimated 2-year survival rates
were 91%, 75%, and 0%, respectively. This observation could serve to advise patients of their prognosis
and treatment options, as well as to evaluate the
benefit of newer therapies in the context of imatinib
failure.
Prognosis of patients post-imatinib failure who
are treated with the new tyrosine kinase inhibitors or
with allogeneic SCT may be strongly associated with
the degree of cytogenetic or molecular response to
these particular therapies. This analysis focused on
survival post-imatinib failure, the original intent of
the study. Outcome by cytogenetic-molecular response will be reported in the context of these individual therapies.
