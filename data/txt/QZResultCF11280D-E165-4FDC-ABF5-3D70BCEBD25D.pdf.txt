ABSTRACT
Mast cell differentiation and proliferation depends on IL-3. IL-3 induces the
activation of MAP-kinases and STATs and consequently induces proliferation and
survival. Dysregulation of IL-3 signaling pathways also contribute to inflammation and
tumorigenesis. We show here that IL-3 induces a SFK- and Ca2+-dependent activation
of the inhibitor of κB kinases 2 (IKK2) which results in mast cell proliferation and
survival but does not induce IκBα-degradation and NFκB activation. Therefore we
propose the term “subthreshold IKK activation”.
This subthreshold IKK activation also primes mast cells for enhanced
responsiveness to IL-33R signaling. Consequently, co-stimulation with IL-3 and IL-33
increases IKK activation and massively enhances cytokine production induced by IL-33.
We further reveal that in neoplastic mast cells expressing constitutively active
Ras, subthreshold IKK activation is associated with uncontrolled proliferation.
Consequently, pharmacological IKK inhibition reduces tumor growth selectively by
inducing apoptosis in vivo.
Together, subthreshold IKK activation is crucial to mediate the full IL-33-induced
effector functions in primary mast cells and to mediate uncontrolled proliferation of
neoplastic mast cells. Thus, IKK2 is a new molecularly defined target structure.

are critical in type I hypersensitivity and therefore central to
the pathogenesis of allergic diseases [6]. The participation of
mast cells in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases has
been reported [7] and refuted [8]. Mast cells can produce
pathogenetically relevant cytokines such as IL-1β, IL-6,
IL-13, IL-17 and TNFα [9]. It has also been demonstrated
that mast cells are critical regulators of the tumor

INTRODUCTION
Mast cells are located in peripheral tissues and
regulate innate and adaptive immune responses [1] by
producing mediators (e.g., histamine, proteases, leukotrienes
or cytokines) that recruit and activate, granulocytes,
dendritic cells, T-lymphocytes and other cells [1–5]. They

microenvironment [10] and that expression of constitutively
active Ras- or c-Kit-mutants leads to development of mast
cell tumors [11, 12].
The most extensively characterized trigger for mast
cell activation is crosslinking of the Fcε-receptor-I (FcεRI)
resulting in the release of mediators including histamine,
proteases, cytokines, and chemokines [13].
Mast cells express TLR/interleukin-1 (IL-1)
receptor (TIR) family members including TLR4 and the
IL-33-receptor (IL-33R) [1, 14]. IL-33 induces antigenindependent activation of mast cells [15] via the canonical
NFκB signaling [16] resulting in cytokine production but
not degranulation [15].
In contrast, IL-3 is crucial to promote differentiation,
survival, and proliferation of mast cells [17–19]. IL-3
activates STAT3/5, JNK1/2, ERK1/2, PI3Ks and mTOR
[17, 20, 21]. Impairment of these signaling cascades
decreases mast cell numbers in peripheral tissues,
compromises bacterial clearance and weakens type I
hypersensitivity [17, 20, 22–24].
Recent publications reported a crosstalk between
FcεRI either with TLRs (including TLR4) or c-Kit
resulting in increased NFκB-, NFAT- or JNK activation
and cytokine production [25, 26]. We found an crosstalk
between activated c-Kit and the IL-1R or the IL-33R
[27, 28] resulting in potentiated cytokine production
in response to IL-1 or IL-33. Here, we identify a novel
mechanism by which IL-3 induces IKK activation which
mediates mitogenic signaling in primary- and tumor mast
cells and modulates the full biological response of IL-33.

degradation (Supplementary Figure S1E). This finding
indicates that IL-3 can induce some IκBα degradation.
In presence of ongoing IκBα re-synthesis, this IL-3induced IκBα degradation is quantitatively not sufficient
to result a net loss of IκBα. Therefore, we propose the
term “subthreshold activation” to describe IKK activation
which suffices to phosphorylate IκBα but is insufficient to
trigger NFκB activation.

RESULTS

The IL-3-induced proliferation depends on JNK1

IL-3-induced IKK activation in BMMC

Next, we investigated whether the IKK-dependent
JNK signaling is relevant for the IL-3-induced BMMC
proliferation. The JNK inhibitor SP600125 significantly
reduced the IL-3-induced proliferation (Figure 3A)
without inducing cell death (Figure 3B and 3C). To
determine which JNK isoform is relevant for the IL-3induced proliferation we used Jnk1-/--, Jnk2-/-- and Jnk3-/-BMMCs. BMMCs do not express JNK3 (Supplementary
Figure S2A-C). The surface expression of IL-3Rα is
equal in wt, Jnk1-/-- and Jnk2-/--BMMCs (Supplementary
Figure S2D). Jnk1-/--BMMC proliferated less strongly
(Figure 3D) in response to IL-3 than wt- or Jnk2-/-BMMCs (Figure 3E). Together these data indicate that
the IL-3-induced proliferation depends on an IKK2-JNK1
signaling pathway.

Subthreshold IKK2 activation is critical for
IL-3-induced proliferation
Having shown that the IL-3-induced subthreshold
IKK activation does not result in efficient cytokine
production, we asked if IKKs mediate the activation of
the mitogenic JNK signaling [24]. Indeed, the IKKinhibitor VII potently impaired the IL-3-induced activation
of JNKs and the phosphorylation of IκBα (Figure 2A).
Consequently, the IKK-inhibitor VII blocked the IL-3induced proliferation (Figure 2B) and BMMC expansion
(Figure 2C) without inducing cell death (Figure 2D).
When IKK-inhibitor VII-treated BMMC were washed and
re-stimulated with IL-3, their proliferative capacity was
restored (Figure 2E).
To confirm the results obtained by pharmacological
inhibition of IKKs, we induced IKK2-deficiency by
injection of Ikk2∆-mice with poly(I:C) [31]. Consequently,
the IL-3-induced proliferation and JNK activation was
reduced in Ikk2∆-BMMC compared to Ikk2F/F-BMMCs
(Figure 2F and 2G).

IL-3 induced IKK activation results in anti-apoptotic
signaling in hepatocytes [29]. We found that IL-3 also
induces IKK activation, IκBα phosphorylation but not
degradation in BMMCs (Figure 1A). To exclude defective
IKK-IκBα signaling we used IL-33, a known activator
of IKK-dependent IκBα degradation. In contrast to IL-3,
IL-33 induced IκBα degradation and cytokine response in
BMMCs which was blocked by treatment with the IKKinhibitor VII (Figure 1B and 1C), the most efficient IKK
inhibitor tested (Supplementary Figure S1A-D).
Next we used NFκB-EGFP-MC/9 [30] mast cells
to examine whether IL-3 induces NFκB activation.
Confirming the results in BMMCs, IL-3 did not induce
IκBα degradation (Figure 1D), EGFP expression (Figure
1E) or an effective cytokine-production (Figure 1F).
Again, IL-33 elicited all these effects in an IKK-dependent
manner (Figure 1D–1F). Thus, IL-3 does not induce the
canonical NFκB signaling. Why does the IL-3-induced
IKK activation fail to activate NFκB? When cells were
cultured with cycloheximide, an inhibitor of protein
biosynthesis, IL-3 induced a mild but detectable IκBα

co-stimulation with IL-3 and IL-33 increased the IκBα
phosphorylation, accelerated its degradation (Figure 4A)
and potentiated the IL-6 mRNA production (Supplementary
Figure S3B) compared to IL-33 alone. Consequently,
IL-6 production after co-stimulation was much stronger
than in response to IL-33 alone (Figure  4B). Notably,
TNFα and IL-13 were only produced when BMMCs were
co-stimulated with IL-3 and IL-33 but were not detectable
upon stimulation with IL-33 alone (Figure 4C and 4D).
Confirming the priming effect of IL-3, the full potentiated
cytokine response was only detectable, when cells were
first stimulated with IL-3 followed by exposure to IL-33.
Pre-stimulation with IL-33 or simultaneous stimulation
with IL-3 and IL-33 induced only a partial co-stimulatory
effect (Supplementary Figure S3C).
Furthermore, cyclohexamide, MyD88-deficiency
(Supplementary Figure S3D and S3E), the IKK-inhibitor
VII (Figure 4E) and (5Z)-7-Oxozeaenol (TAK1 inhibitor)
(data not shown) completely blocked the IL-33- and IL-3/
IL-33-induced cytokine production. In contrast, the SFKinhibitor SU6656 only reduced the cytokine production
(Figure 4F) whereas JNK1-deficiency (Figure 4G) had
no effect. These data show that the de novo synthesis
of cytokines induced by IL-33 or IL-33 in combination
with IL-3, strictly depends on the MyD88-TAK1-IKK2
signaling whereas SFKs have only modulatory functions.
Thus, whereas the IL-3-induced and SFK-dependent JNK1
activation mediates proliferation it does not influence the
IL-33-induced cytokine production.

in combination with IL-3 induced NFAT activation in NFATEGFP-MC/9 cells compared to ionomycin (Supplementary
Figure S4D-F). These data show that Ca2+ is critical for the
induced cytokine production independently of NFAT.
The Orai1/STIM1-Ca2+-channel system is important
for FcεRI-mediated mast cell effector functions [41].
Therefore we hypothesized that the IL-33- and/or the IL-3/
IL-33-induced cytokine production also depends on Orai1
and Stim1. Neither Orai1- (Supplementary Figure S4G)
nor STIM1- (data not shown) deficiency affected the IL33- or IL-3/IL-33-induced cytokine production.
The IL-3-induced Ca2+ mobilization depends on PLCγ
[38]. In contrast, IL-33 does not induce PLCγ activation
(data not shown) but was reported to induce a PLD1dependent Ca2+ mobilization resulting in NFκB activation
[42]. Neither treatment of NFκB-EGFP-MC/9 cells with
the PLD1 inhibitor CAY10594 (Supplementary Figure
S4H) nor PLD1 deficiency (Figure 5H) influenced NFκB
activation or cytokine production. As expected the PLCγ
inhibitor U-73122 did not affect the IL-33-induced cytokine
response but blocked the potentiated cytokine response
induced by co-stimulation with IL-3 and IL-33 (Figure 5I).
These data indicate that the IL-3-induced PLCγ
activation and the resulting Ca2+ mobilization are crucial
for mast cell priming and the resulting potentiated
cytokine production.

IL-3-induced mast cell priming also depends
on Ca2+

In primary mast cells, IKK inactivation reduced the
IL-3-induced mitogenic signaling. IL-3, c-Kit and IKKs
are involved in pathogenesis of a number of malignancies
[43–45]. Therefore, we determined the activation status
of IKKs and their relevance for survival and proliferation
in tumor mast cells. The v-HA-Ras-transformed V2D1
murine tumor mast cells constitutively produces IL3, resulting in autocrine stimulation, proliferation and
survival [46]. In these cells we found an increased JNK
activation and IκBα phosphorylation but no degradation
excluding the production of cytokines that activate NFκB
(Figure 6A).
The IKK-inhibitor VII blocked the activation of
JNKs, the phosphorylation of IκBα (Figure 6B) and
consequently reduced cell proliferation (Figure 6C) by
inducing cell death (Figure 6D). This demonstrates the
relevance of IKKs in V2D1 cells. Given that survival of
V2D1 cells depends on IL-3 production we speculated that
IKKs are involved in IL-3 production and that exogenous
IL-3 rescues V2D1 cells from cell death induced by IKK
inhibition. As shown in Figure 6E IL-3 production is
reduced by IKK inhibition. Moreover, the IKK-inhibitor
VII-induced cell death can be reversed by exogenous
IL-3 (Figure 6F). These data show that subthreshold IKK
activation is important for IL-3 production to mediate
mitogenic signaling in V2D1 cells.

Subthreshold IKK activation mediates survival
of tumor mast cells

Ca2+ mediates IL-3-inudced signaling [38] and is
important for TNFα-induced IKK activation [37]. We
investigated whether Ca2+ also mediates the IL-3-induced
subthreshold IKK activation and consequently induces
mast cell priming.
The Ca2+ chelator BAPTA-AM blocked the IL-3induced IKK activation (Figure 5A), the IL-33-induced
canonical NFκB signaling and cytokine production in
BMMCs (Figure 5B and 5C) and NFκB-EGFP-MC/9 cells
(Supplementary Figure S4A and S4B). This shows that Ca2+
is critical for the IL-3- and IL-33-induced IKK activation.
Next we investigated the role of Ca2+ by using ionomycin.
We used suboptimal ionomycin concentrations that neither
induces NFAT activation nor cytokine production [39, 40]
(Supplementary Figure S4C). Combined with IL-33, 2 ng
ionomycin showed the most pronounced potentiated IL-6
production (Figure 5D) which was blocked by BAPTA-AM,
the IKK-inhibitor VII and was reduced by SU6656 (Figure
5E–5G). Therefore, ionomycin mimics IL-3 stimulation and
potentiates the IL-33-induced cytokine production.
Ca2+ mobilization induces NFAT activation. Thus, we
tested whether stimulation with IL-33 alone or in combination
with IL-3 induces NFAT activation. Neither IL-33 nor IL-33

Inhibition of IKKs reduces tumor growth in vivo

Therefore the signal strength determines the
effector functions resulting from IKK activation. Weak,
subthreshold, IKK activation as induced by IL-3 suffices
to induce proliferation but not NFκB activation. Stronger
IKK activation as provided by IL-33 signaling results in
NFκB activation and production of cytokines. Combined
signaling via IL-3 and IL-33 results in proliferation
and strongly enhanced cytokine production. Under
homeostatic conditions IL-3 serves as growth and survival
factor for mast cells. Under pathological conditions (tissue
damage) the presence of the alarmin IL-33 dramatically
alters the mast cells’ response to IL-3 which now becomes
much more pro-inflammatory (IL-6, TNFα, IL-13).
In tumor cells, dysregulated expression of IL-3 is the
molecular basis for survival and proliferation [11, 43, 46,
49] leading to malignancies, including mast cell leukemia
(MCL), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and chronic
myeloid leukemia (CML). In such cells subthreshold
IKK activation might be a prerequisite for permanent
proliferation. Indeed, pharmacological inhibition of
subthreshold IKK activation specifically reduces tumor
growth in vivo. Since IKK inhibition induced cell death
in tumor- but not in primary-cells, IKK-inhibition could
be a powerful approach to specifically eliminate certain
tumor cells. In summary, our data indicate that the IL3-induced subthreshold IKK activation is an important
mechanism that mediates pathological effector functions
in inflamed tissues after infection, allergy, necrosis and
supports survival of tumor cells. Therefore, inhibition
of subthreshold IKK activation might be a potential and
selective tool to treat such mast cell driven diseases.

To analyze tumor growth in vivo, we used DBA/1Rag1-/--mice (Figure 7A). We injected 1 x 106 V2D1 mast
cells subcutaneously. After 7 days, a 25 μM IKK-inhibitor
VII solution or vehicle was injected intratumorally for
6 weeks. As shown in Figure 7B and 7C tumor size was
significantly decreased in mice treated with the IKKinhibitor. Cells obtained from an explanted tumor still
expressed c-Kit, IL-3Rα, and IL-33R (Figure 7D) and
showed IKK-dependent IL-3 production (Figure 7E)
and proliferation (Figure 7F). These data verify that
the explanted cancer cells are still dependent on IL-3
production for autocrine stimulation and survival.

DISCUSSION
We identified IKKs as important for IL-3-induced
mitogenic signaling in BMMCs. Hitherto, IKK2 has
been known as an important component in the signaling
pathways emanating from receptors such as antigen
receptors, TIR- and TNFR-superfamily family members
[32, 47]. In all of these cases, IKK2 activation results in
IκBα degradation and NFκB activation [48]. In contrast
to the canonical pathway, we found that IL-3 induced
only a weak and transient subthreshold IKK activation,
which resulted in IκBα phosphorylation without IκBα
degradation and without NFκB activation.
The major questions are (i) how does IL-3 induce
subthreshold IKK2 activation?; and (ii) why is there
no IκBα degradation and NFκB activation? Neither
MyD88- nor Malt1- or Bcl10-deficiency influence the
IL-3-induced mast cell proliferation [32]. Instead, our
data indicate a critical role of SFKs and Ca2+ for the IL3-induced subthreshold IKK activation. We hypothesize
that the combined activation of SFKs, PLCs and a Ca2+dependent PKC-isoform mediates subthreshold IKK2
activation.
These data indicate that components (e.g., the
MyD88-IRAK-TAK1-signaling module) critical for
effective IκBα phosphorylation and degradation are not
activated. Therefore the IL-3-induced IKK activation
is only sufficient to induce mitogenic signaling, but is
below the threshold to induce IκBα degradation and
NFκB activation. Although the reason for the missing
IκBα degradation is still unknown we suggest that IκBα
degradation occurs to some extent upon IL-3 stimulation
but is quantitatively not sufficient to induce a net loss of
IκBα in the presence of ongoing IκBα re-synthesis.
Additionally, the IL-3-induced subthreshold IKK
activation primes mast cells for enhanced NFκB activation
in response to IL-33. This shows that mast cells integrate
signals from different receptors which activate IKKs.
Thereby, both, the IL-3-induced and SFK-mediated, and
the IL-33-induced but MyD88-IRAK-TAK1-dependent
pathways are crucial to facilitate full IKK2 activity.

from WEHI-3 cells). V2D1-cells (Dr. Moroni, Department of
Biochemistry, University of Basel, Switzerland; [46]) were
cultured in complete IMDM (V2D1).

oligo(dT)-primers, the M-MLV reverse transcriptase
(affymetrix), RNase inhibitor (Promega) and the PCR
thermocycler (Biometra). For the quantitative IL-6 real-time
PCR the 5′ primer TCTCTGCAAGAGACTTCCATCCAGT
and the 3′ primer AGCCTCCGACTTGTGAAGTGGT
were used. The quantitative real-time PCR was performed
with the KAPA SYBR fast kit (peqlab) according to
the manufacturer’s guidelines in an ABI Step OnePlus
Real-Time PCR System (life technologies). GAPDH
real-time PCR was performed by using the 5′ primer
TTGGCCGTATTGGGCGCCTG and the 3′ primer
CACCCTTCAAGTGGGCCCCG. Relative gene expre­
ssion was determined using the conventional ßßCT method
setting the control (unstimulated samples) as 1.

Flow cytometry
Non-specific binding was blocked with anti-CD16/
CD32 (clone 2.4G2) and rat-IgG (Jackson). Cells were
stained with biotinylated anti-murine IL-33R antibody (3E10;
[56]), PE-conjugated streptavidine, the APC-conjugated
anti-CD123 antibody (R&D Systems), the PE-conjugated
anti-murine CD117 antibody (Biolegend) or the anti-murine
FcεRI antibody (FITC- conjugated) (eBioscience) (in PBS
containing 0.25% BSA and 0.02% sodium azide).
For EGFP-production, NFκB- or NFAT-EGFPMC/9 cells (106 cells/ml) were IL-3-starved (1 h), pretreated with inhibitors (30 min) and stimulated with IL-3
or IL-33 (8 h) (both Peprotech). After harvesting and
washing (PBA-buffer; 0.25% BSA and 0.02% sodium
azide in PBS) cells were analyzed by using an LSR II flow
cytometer (BD) and FlowJo 8.1.1 (Treestar Inc.).

Immunoblotting
Samples were separated on 10% sodium dodecyl
sulfate (SDS)-Laemmli gels and transferred by
electroblotting onto nitrocellulose membranes (Biostep).
Membranes were blocked in 0.1% Tween/TBS-buffer
with 5% dry milk and incubated with antibodies detecting
phosphorylated/non-phosphorylated proteins. We used antipT183/Y185-JNK-1/2/JNK-1/2, anti-pS176/177-IKK1/2/
IKK1/2, anti-pT345/S346-IRAK4, anti-pS32-IκBα/IκBα,
anti-PLD1 and anti-tubulin (Cell Signaling; except antiIKK1/2 from Santa Cruz and anti-tubulin from Sigma).
Membranes were washed in 0.1% Tween/TBS and incubated
with HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies: anti-rabbit-Ig,
anti-goat-Ig (Santa Cruz) and anti-mouse-Ig (Thermo).
Detection was performed using ECL reagent (Pierce).

Stimulation and lysis
BMMCs (106 cells/ml) were IL-3-starved (1 h),
pre-incubated (30 min) with SP600125 (JNK-inhibitor),
SU6656 (SFK-inhibitor), IKK-inhibitors (VII, PS-1145,
BMS-34554) and U73122 (PLC inhibitor) (If not other
stated all these inhibitors were used in a concentration of 5
μM). Furthermore we used the protein biosynthesis inhibitor
cyclohexamide (340 μM), the PLD1 inhibitor CAY10594
(10 μM), and the Ca2+ chelator BAPTA-AM (10 μM) or
ionomycin (in a concentration from 0,5–10 ng/ml) (all
inhibitors were from Merck Millipore). After pre-incubation
of the indicated inhibitor cells were stimulated with IL-3
and/ or IL-33 (Peprotec., in a concentration of 50 ng/ml).
V2D1 cells were seeded (106 cells/ml), pre-treated with
the IKK-inhibitor VII (1 h). Cells were lysed (in 20 mM
HEPES, pH7.5; 10 mM EGTA; 40 mM β-glycerophosphate;
2.5 mM MgCl2; 2 mM orthovanadate; 1 mM dithiothreitol;
20 μg/ml aprotinin; 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 1% Triton). Protein
concentration was determined by using the BCA-assay
(Pierce) and samples were boiled in 6 x Laemmli buffer.

Cell death and cell counting
106 cells/ml (BMMCs) or 105 cells/ml (V2D1)
were pre-treated with the IKK-inhibitor VII or SP600125
(48 h), harvested, washed (PBA-buffer) and treated with
propidium iodide (PI). Cells were analyzed with the LSR
II flow cytometer (BD) and FlowJo 8.1.1 (Treestar Inc.).
For cell counting BMMCs (106 cells/ml) were
seeded in IL-3-free media. After 1 h cells were treated
with IKK-inhibitor VII (for 30 min) and were stimulated
with IL-3 as indicated. Cells were 1:1 mixed with trypan
blue solution and trypan blue-negative cells were counted
by using Neubauer counting chamber.

ELISA and proliferation assays
BMMCs (106 cells/ml) or V2D1 (105 cells/ml) were
seeded in IL-3-free media. Cells were incubated with vehicle
(DMSO) or inhibitors. BMMC were stimulated with IL-3,
IL-33 or both (Peprotech). Supernatants were analyzed for
IL-3, IL-6, TNFα and IL-13 using matched pair antibodies
(eBioscience) by ELISA. For proliferation assays cells
were cultured for 54 h. [H3]thymidin (1 μCi) was added for
additional 18 h. Incorporated radioactivity was measured by
using a β-scintillation counter (Perkin Elmer). The increase

q PCR
Cells stimulated with IL-3 and/or IL-33 were
pelleted and lysed with TRIzol (life technologies).
RNA was extracted according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. Total RNA (2 μg) was reverse transcripted using

Xenograft tumor model

Funding

DBA/1-Rag1-/--mice (10–18 weeks old) received 106
V2D1-cells in 100 μl subcutaneously into the shaved flanks.
Animals were treated 3 times weekly with vehicle (1%
DMSO/PBS) or the IKK-inhibitor VII (100 μl; 25 μM in 1%
DMSO/PBS) subcutaneously around the tumors. Tumor size
was assessed 3 times weekly by using a Mitutoyo Quick
Mini caliper (Mitutoyo). Measurements were recorded as
tumor area (mm2) from groups of 10 mice. Tumor area (A)
was calculated by the formula: [A = tumor height x tumor
width]. Experiments were terminated after 6 weeks or if
tumor size exceeded the ethically approved dimensions.
