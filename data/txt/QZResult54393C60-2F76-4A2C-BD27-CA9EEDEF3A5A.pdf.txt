Abstract
Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified SMAD7 on 8q21 as being associated with colorectal cancer. We evaluated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in the SMAD7 gene, including rs4939827,
rs12953717, and rs4464148, previously identified from GWAS in a large population-based case-control study
of colon cancer. We observed that rs12953717 was associated with a statistically significant increased risk of
colon cancer [odds ratio, 1.38; 95% confidence intervals (CI), 1.13–1.68; P linear trend < 0.01] for the TT genotype compared with the CC genotype, whereas the CC genotype of the rs4939827 SNP was inversely
associated with colon cancer (0.77; 95% CI, 0.64–0.93) relative to the TT genotype. There were no significant
differences in association for either of these polymorphisms when stratified by age, tumor site, sex, or family
history. The odds ratios between SMAD7 and colon cancer among individuals reporting recent aspirin/
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use was 0.60 (95% CI, 0.43–0.85) for the CC genotype of the rs4939827
polymorphism and 1.69 (95% CI, 1.20–2.38) for the TT genotype of the rs1295371 polymorphism. This result
compares to odds ratios of 0.86 (95% CI, 0.68–1.09) for rs4939827 and 1.22 (95% CI, 0.96–1.56) among individuals who did not use aspirin/nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. An assessment of SMAD7 genotypes
with tumor markers did not reveal any significant differences by KRAS2, TP53, CpG island methylator phenotype, or microsatellite instability status. No significant associations were observed for the rs4464148 SNP or
other SNPs evaluated in the SMAD7. These results corroborate the findings of GWAS in colon cancer pointing
to SMAD7 and reinforce interest in SNPs in this gene. Cancer Res; 70(4); 1479–85. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have detected
associations between various loci and colon cancer. 8q24,
8q23, 11q23, 3q21, and SMAD7 on 18q21 have all been identified as potentially involved in colon cancer etiology (1–6).
Of these loci on chromosomal regions of 8q21, biological rationale exists for an association between SMAD7 and colorectal cancer (CRC). SMAD7 is involved in inflammation-related
pathways and has been shown to modulate transforming
growth factor-β (TGF-β) and Wnt signaling (7), which are
central to the development of colon tumors. Three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) of the SMAD7 gene, rs4939827,
rs12953717, and rs4464148, were identified in the GWAS by
Broderick and colleagues for both adenomas and cancers

(2). Those carrying the rs4939827 homozygote variant genotype showed a 27% reduced risk of CRC [95% confidence intervals (CI), 0.66-0.80], rs12953717 was associated with a 37%
increased risk for those with the homozygote variant genotype (95% CI, 1.25–1.50), and rs4464148 was associated with a
35% increased risk for the homozygote variant genotype (95%
CI, 1.20–1.51). These three SNPs map to the same linkage
disequilibrium block within intron 3 of the SMAD7 gene.
Another GWAS conducted among individuals with a family
history of CRC observed that the rs4939827 SMAD7 SNP
was inversely associated with CRC (2). In contrast to other
studies, the study by Tenesa and colleagues (1) found a statistically consistent 20% increased risk of CRC for the
rs4939827 SMAD7 variant allele, rather than a 27% reduction
in risk reported by others; it is possible that these results reflect different variant alleles in the population studied, given
that the minor allele frequency was close to 0.5 (and two
GWAS did not report the actual genotypes but instead ORhom
or ORhet). The same group reported an 18% (95% CI, 1.12–
1.23) increase per T allele of variant rs12953717.
Using data from a large multi-center study of colon cancer,
we looked to confirm those associations as well as to determine other factors that might influence the SMAD7 SNPs and
colon cancer association. Factors evaluated include age, tumor site, sex, family history of CRC in first-degree relatives,
and recent use of aspirin/nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
drugs (NSAID) given that SMAD7 seems to be involved in
inflammation-related mechanisms.

Materials and Methods
Data for the study came from colon cancer case-control
studies conducted in Utah, the Northern California Kaiser
Permanente Medical Care Program, and the Twin Cities
Metropolitan area of Minnesota. Eligibility included being between 30 and 79 y of age at the time of diagnosis, Englishspeaking, mentally competent to complete the interview,
no previous history of CRC, and no known (as indicated on
the pathology report) familial adenomatous polyposis, ulcerative colitis, or Crohn's disease. Controls were frequencymatched to cases by sex and by 5-y age groups. At the Kaiser
Permanente Medical Care Program, controls were randomly
selected from membership lists. In Utah, controls 65 y and
older were randomly selected from lists provided by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (formerly Heath Care
Finance Administration) and controls younger than 65 were
randomly selected from driver's license lists. In Minnesota,
controls were randomly selected from driver's license lists.
Study eligibility and recruitment details of the study have been
published previously (8, 9). Roughly 91% of the population was
non-Hispanic white.
Trained and certified interviewers collected diet and lifestyle data as previously outlined (10, 11). The referent year
for the study was the calendar year ∼2 y prior to the date
of diagnosis (cases) or selection (controls). Information was
collected on demographic factors such as age, sex, and study
center, diet, physical activity, aspirin and nonsteroidal drug
use, body size, and other lifestyle factors including medical,
family, and reproductive history.
DNA was extracted from blood drawn from study participants; these analyses were limited to those individuals who
provided a blood sample, which represented roughly 85% of
those requested to provide a sample. Genotyping of the 11
SMAD7 SNPs, rs4939827, rs4464148, rs2337107, rs7238442,

rs1316447, and rs3736242 were performed in multiplex using
GoldenGate assays (Illumina; see Appendix), marker
rs4939827 failed on the Illumina platform and thus was subsequently genotyped using a TaqMan-based assay. Twenty
nanograms of genomic DNA from each individual were
subjected to the TaqMan assay (ABI) according to the methods of the manufacturer. Data were collected using an ABI
7900HT instrument. Intraplate and interplate replicates at a
rate of ∼5% were included on all plates and in all batches with
no discordant genotypes in replicates. Polymorphisms were
evaluated separately in both cases and controls and were
found to be in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (Table 1).
We have previously evaluated tumors for CpG island
methylator phenotype (CIMP), microsatellite instability
(MSI), TP53 mutations, and KRAS2 mutations (12–15) and
were therefore able to evaluate SMAD7 genotypes with specific tumor markers. Details for methods used to evaluate
these epigenetic and genetic changes have been described
in previous publications (12–15).
SAS statistical package, version 9.1 (SAS Institute) was
used to conduct the analyses. Multivariate logistic regression
models were used to evaluate the associations between colon
cancer and SMAD7 genotypes. All logistic regression models
were minimally adjusted for age at selection or diagnosis,
study center, race or ethnicity, and sex because these were
categorical study-matching variables. We evaluated associations adjusting for other colon cancer risk factors including
body mass index (BMI; kg/m2), long-term vigorous physical
activity level, recent use of aspirin/NSAIDs (defined as use
within the past 2 y), and dietary calcium and energy intake.
Odds ratios (OR) and 95% CI were used to report associations obtained from the multivariate logistic regression models. Trend across genotype was assessed by comparing the

log likelihood of a logistic regression model with the genotype as an ordered categorical variable to the log likelihood
of a model without the genotype using a χ2 test with 1 df.
Multivariate logistic regression models were also used to
evaluate the joint association of colon cancer with the
SMAD7 polymorphism, age, sex, family history of CRC among
first-degree relatives, and use of aspirin/NSAIDs within the
past 2 y. Proximal tumors were defined as those tumors located in the cecum through the transverse colon and distal
tumors in the splenic flexure, descending, and sigmoid colon.
Effect modification between genotypes and exposure variables was evaluated by a likelihood ratio test for a multiplicative interaction term in the logistic regression model.
Multinomial logistic regression models were used to evaluate
the associations of tumor characteristics and SMAD7 polymorphisms. Effect modification between tumor characteristics and SMAD7 polymorphisms was evaluated by a
likelihood ratio test of a case-case only logistic regression
model with the variable of interest to a model without the
variable using a χ2 test with 2 df.

Results
The minor allele frequency for rs4939827 was 49%, 42% for
rs12953717 (T allele), and 30% for the rs4464148 (C allele) in
this population (Table 1). The r2 value between rs4939827
and 12953717 was 0.59 (data not shown in table). The
rs12953717 SMAD7 variant was associated with a statistically
significant increased risk of colon cancer in this population
(OR, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.13–1.68), whereas rs4939827 was associated with a significant inverse association with colon cancer
(OR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.64–0.93; Table 2); a significant linear
trend was observed for both SNPs (P linear trend < 0.01).

Cancer Res; 70(4) February 15, 2010

The rs4464148 variant along with the other SNPs assessed
was not associated with altered risk of colon cancer. We
did not detect stronger associations by combined genotype
or by haplotype.
Further evaluation of both variants showed no statistically
significant differences in association with colon cancer
according to tumor site, sex, age, and family history
of CRC for either the rs4939827 or the rs12953717 variants
(Table 3). There was a significant linear trend across both
polymorphisms of altered risk among those who reported
recent use of aspirin/NSAIDs (OR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.43–0.85
for rs4939827 and OR, 1.69; 95% CI, 1.20–2.38 for
rs1295371) but not among those who did not recently use
aspirin/NSAIDs, although the difference between the two
groups was not statistically significant (P interaction, 0.08
and 0.10, respectively).
We evaluated associations between the SMAD7 variant and
tumor markers (Table 4). Although the strongest associations
for any tumor marker were observed for MSI tumors (OR,
1.58; 95% CI, 1.03–2.43 comparing the TT versus the CC genotypes for rs1295371 and OR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.44–1.04 comparing the CC to TT genotypes of rs4939827), for the most part,
differences were minimal when looking at CIMP positive versus CIMP negative, MSS versus MSI, KRAS2 wild-type versus
mutated tumors, and TP53 wild-type versus mutated tumors.

Discussion
Consistent with the GWAS by Broderick and colleagues
(2), we observed a statistically significant association between both the rs4939827 the rs12953717 SMAD7 polymorphisms and colon cancer; however, we did not observe a similar
association for the rs4464148 variant and risk of colon cancer

in this large multi-centered population-based study. The
strength of associations reported here are similar to those
previously reported.
Because of the extensive data available from this study,
we have been able to further define associations based on
demographic and tumor characteristics of the population.
We observed slightly stronger associations for men, distal
tumors, and older individuals, none of which significantly
varied according to the categories assessed. Although not
significant, there was a suggestion of difference in association by aspirin/NSAID use for both the rs4939827 and the
rs12953717 polymorphisms. Because SMAD7 is plausibly
involved in an inflammation-related pathway through its regulation of TGF-β, it is logical that exogenous factors which
regulate inflammation might modulate the association between SMAD7 and CRC. More powerful studies should assess
this association to see if there is an interaction that we were
underpowered to detect.
The potential importance of SMAD7 in the etiology of CRC
is supported from several avenues of research other than the
GWAS. TGF-β mediates the intracellular actions of proinflammatory cytokines, including the activation of nuclear
factor-Kβ (16, 17). Deficiency of TGF-β has been shown to
lead to extensive inflammation (16). SMAD7 promotes the
anti-inflammatory action of the TGF-β signaling pathway
(7). However, SMAD7 has other mechanisms that are relevant to CRC. Studies in mice have shown that the SMAD7
IVs2-21 variant was associated with type 2 diabetes (18).
An insulin-related pathway has been proposed for CRC, on
the other hand, the association with type 2 diabetes might
also have an inflammation association because inflammation
processes influence insulin-related pathways (19). Other
studies have shown that SMAD7 degrades β-catenin signaling, altering the Wnt-signaling pathway which is a central
element in CRC (20). The SMAD7 genotype has been associated with survival after diagnosis with CRC (3).
The GWAS conducted by Tomlinson and colleagues evaluated associations among individuals with a family history of
CRC (21, 22). Although this design strategy was done to enrich the sample for identification of susceptibility alleles,
studies have shown different risk factors for individuals with
a family history and those without a family history (22). Many
lifestyle risk factors have been shown to have a greater influence among those without a family history of CRC compared
with those with a family history of CRC (2, 22, 23). Our examination of SMAD7 according to family history casts further
light on the interpretation and evaluation of GWAS that
focus on those only with a family history of CRC.

Because of our extensive data set which includes not only
demographics, diet, and lifestyle exposures, but also tumor
markers, we were able to evaluate whether the previously
identified SMAD7 SNPs were associated with specific tumor
types. Although slight variations existed according to tumor
markers, we did not observe statistically significant differences according to any of the markers evaluated.
Whereas GWAS have included colon and rectal tumors together, our study examined only colon cancer. Several studies
of both environmental and genetic factors suggest different
etiologies for colon and rectal cancers (24–26). The study by
Broderick did not detect differences by site, although it is unclear how they defined tumor site. We observed only slightly
stronger nonsignificant associations for more distal tumors;
the study by Curtin and colleagues (27) suggest significant
associations for distal tumors only, suggesting that site might
be a relevant factor when considering risk associated with
the SMAD7 variants.
Results from this study add to the growing body of knowledge that SMAD7 is an important component of CRC development. While providing support for an association between
SMAD7 variants and risk of colon cancer, we have added to
previous findings by examining these variants with lifestyle
and demographic factors and tumor mutations. Further
research on the functionality of SMAD7 variants is needed
to better understand the observed associations.
