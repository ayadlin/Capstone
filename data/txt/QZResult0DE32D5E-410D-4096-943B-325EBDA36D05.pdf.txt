BACKGROUND: RAS/RAF/mitogen-activated protein kinase activation is common in myeloid malignancies. Trametinib, a mitogenactivated protein kinase kinase 1 (MEK1)/MEK2 inhibitor with activity against multiple myeloid cell lines at low nanomolar concentrations, was evaluated for safety and clinical activity in patients with relapsed/refractory leukemias. METHODS: This phase 1/2 study
accrued patients with any relapsed/refractory leukemia in phase 1. In phase 2, this study accrued patients with relapsed/refractory
acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or high-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) with NRAS or KRAS mutations (cohort 1); patients with
AML, MDS, or chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) with a RAS wild-type mutation or an unknown mutation status (cohort 2);
and patients with CMML with an NRAS or KRAS mutation (cohorts 3). RESULTS: The most commonly reported treatment-related
adverse events were diarrhea, rash, nausea, and increased alanine aminotransferase levels. The phase 2 recommended dose for Trametinib was 2 mg orally daily. The overall response rates were 20%, 3%, and 27% for cohorts 1, 2, and 3, respectively, and this indicated preferential activity among RAS-mutated myeloid malignancies. Repeated cycles of trametinib were well tolerated with
manageable or reversible toxicities; these results were similar to those of other trametinib studies. CONCLUSIONS: The selective,
single-agent activity of trametinib against RAS-mutated myeloid malignancies validates its therapeutic potential. Combination strategies based on a better understanding of the hierarchical role of mutations and signaling in myeloid malignancies are likely to

INTRODUCTION
Activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 (ERK1)/ERK2 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway is common in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML).1-4 A mutation in the RAS gene (25%-40%) is the most frequent genetic event leading to MAPK
activation in myeloid malignancies5-7 In certain subgroups of AML (eg, AML with an inversion 16 cytogenetic

abnormality),8 the overall frequency of mutations of genes
involved in the MAPK pathway is approximately 90%.9
In CMML, the frequency of RAS mutations is approximately 20%, and these mutations are often associated
with a proliferative variant of the disease.10,11 Apart from
mutations in the RAS family of proteins, other oncogenic
mutations (eg, Fms-related tyrosine kinase 3 [FLT3]12,13
and BCR-ABL14,15) that are not linearly involved also activate the MAPK pathway. Finally, a loss of negative regulators of RAS (eg, SPRY4 [chromosome 5q] and NF1
[chromosome 17]) can lead to a myeloid leukemia phenotype in mouse models.16
Direct inhibition of RAS has been challenging, but
mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1 (MEK1) and
MEK2 are potential targets in the RAS/RAF/MEK/
MAPK pathway immediately upstream of the ERK1/
ERK2 MAPKs.17 The efficacy of MEK inhibitors has
been demonstrated in preclinical models of AML.17 Trametinib (Mekinist; GlaxoSmithKline, Research Triangle
Park, NC) is a selective, oral, allosteric inhibitor of
MEK1/MEK2 that inhibits ERK phosphorylation at low
nanomolar concentrations. Trametinib is approved by the
US Food and Drug Administration as a single agent or in
combination with dabrafenib (Tafinlar; GlaxoSmithKline) for the treatment of unresectable or metastatic melanoma with a BRAF V600E/V600K mutation.
Trametinib inhibits the proliferation of myeloid cell
lines at low nanomolar concentrations, and this supports
its clinical evaluation in myeloid malignancies.17 We
report the results of a phase 1/2 study evaluating the
safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), and clinical activity of trametinib monotherapy in patients with relapsed or refractory leukemia.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients

Patients who were 18 years old or older with relapsed or refractory leukemia were eligible for phase 1 of the study. In
phase 2, patients were enrolled into 1 of 3 cohorts: relapsed
or refractory AML or high-risk MDS with an NRAS or
KRAS mutation (cohort 1), relapsed or refractory AML or
high-risk MDS with a RAS wild-type or unknown mutation status (cohort 2), or CMML with an NRAS or KRAS
mutation (treatment-naive or previously treated; cohort 3).
Additional inclusion criteria included an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 to 2, a calcium phosphorus product  4.0 mmol2/L2 (50 mg2/dL2),
adequate organ function, and no chemotherapy or investigational anticancer drugs within 2 weeks. Exclusion criteria
1872

included the following: prior MEK inhibitor exposure,
concurrent malignancy, predisposing factors or history of
retinal vein occlusion or central serous retinopathy, retinal
pathology considered a risk factor for retinal vein occlusion
or central serous retinopathy, presence of cardiac risk factors, and any unresolved toxicity (grade > 1) from previous
therapy.
Study Design

This open-label, dose-escalation, nonrandomized, multicenter phase 1/2 study (GlaxoSmithKline study MEK111759;
ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT00920140) was conducted
at 19 centers in the United States, Germany, Belgium, and
France. The protocol was approved by each institution’s
ethics committee or review board in accordance with the
Declaration of Helsinki, applicable International Committee on Harmonization guidelines, GlaxoSmithKline standard operating procedures, and national or local regulatory
requirements. Written informed consent was obtained from
all patients before participation in any study-related assessments, procedures, or treatment.
For phase 1, a traditional 3 1 3 design was used
with a 50% increase in the dose level between cohorts.
At least 3 patients in each dose cohort were required to
receive treatment for 28 days (in the absence of a doselimiting toxicity before escalation to the next dose level).
The starting dose was a 3-mg loading dose of trametinib
followed by continuous 1-mg dosing once daily. The
loading dose was later omitted on account of toxicity concerns (eg, ocular toxicity) arising from the first-time-inhuman solid tumor study because of the higher maximum
observed concentration. The phase 2 part with the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) used a Bayesian design to
allow for early termination due to a lack of efficacy. The
initial design included only cohorts 1 and 2; however,
cohort 3 (patients with CMML with a RAS mutation) was
added because of the relatively high frequency of RAS
mutations in CMML and early evidence of trametinib activity in RAS-mutated leukemias.
Mutation Analysis

RAS mutations were detected in DNA extracted from
bone marrow aspirates. The presence of any of 7 KRAS
mutations in codons 12 and 13 was identified by realtime polymerase chain reaction. The assay sensitivity was
1% (2% for G12S). For the NRAS mutation, sample
DNA was subjected to 2 polymerase chain reaction reactions (exon 2 and exon 3 of NRAS) followed by bidirectional dye terminator sequencing. The lower limit of

detection of the assay was 10% mutated DNA into unmutated DNA.
Safety Assessment

Adverse events were graded according to the Common
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (version 4.0).
For grade 2 or 3 trametinib-related toxicities, dosing was
resumed with or without a dose reduction if the toxicity
resolved to grade 1 or the baseline. Permanent treatment
discontinuation was required for any grade 4 trametinibrelated toxicity as well as specified treatment-related liver
toxicities.
PK Assessment

A plasma PK analysis was performed in phase 1 before the
dose and 24 hours after the dose after single-day (day 1)
and multiple-day (day 15) dosing. In phase 2, blood samples were taken before the dose on day 1 of each cycle and
before the dose on day 15 of cycle 1.
Analytical Methods

The PK analysis used liquid-liquid extraction followed by
high-performance liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry analysis.
Statistical Analysis

In phase 1, preliminary safety and PK data were reviewed
after the completion of each cohort. Responses were
assessed according to the International Working Group
criteria for AML, CMML, and MDS.18 In phase 2, each
cohort was evaluated with the same hypotheses testing
framework and interim monitoring rule. The null hypothesis was that the response rate (defined as the percentage of patients who achieved complete remission [CR],
complete remission with a platelet count < 100 3 109/L
[CRp], a partial response [PR], or a morphological
leukemia-free state) with trametinib would not be of sufficient interest (3%). The alternative hypothesis was that
the response rate would be of sufficient interest (15%).
Bayesian statistics were used to calculate the predictive
and posterior probabilities of success (rejecting the null
hypothesis) with a noninformative prior b distribution
(.005, .005). Enrollment into any cohort could stop early
after the enrollment of 25 patients for futility if the predictive probability of success was <5%. The probability of
early termination due to futility was 73% if the true
response rate was 3%. There was a 3% risk of making
an incorrect decision to terminate the study early if the
true response rate was 15%.

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics

A total of 97 patients (14 in phase 1 and 83 in phase 2:
AML, 75%; high-risk MDS, 12%; CMML, 11%; and
ALL, 1%) were enrolled (Table 1). Cytogenetic information was unavailable for 26% of the patients; 19% were
diploid, and 20% had adverse-risk cytogenetics (Table 1).
Overall, 63% of the enrolled patients had RAS mutations;
13 patients (13%) had KRAS mutations, and 54 patients
(56%) had NRAS mutations (Table 1). Twenty-five
patients who were enrolled at 1 center (The University of
Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center) underwent mutation testing for FLT3, nucleophosmin/nucleoplasmin
family member 1 (NPM1), and KIT (Supporting Table 1
[see online supporting information]). Among them, 2
patients had an FLT3 D835 mutation (both NRASmutated), and 1 had an NPM1 mutation (NRASmutated). Ninety-six percent of the patients had received
at least 1 prior therapy, with the majority of the patients
(94%) having received chemotherapy (Table 1). For 64
patients (66%), trametinib was the third or greater line of
therapy.
Treatment

The first cohort of patients enrolled in phase 1 (n 5 3)
were given a 3-mg loading dose of trametinib followed by
continuous 1-mg once daily dosing. Two additional
patients were treated at the 1-mg dose level without a
loading dose. Nine patients were treated at the 2-mg daily
dose level. The only dose-limiting toxicity at the 2-mg
dose level was a fatal intracerebral hemorrhage in the setting of refractory thrombocytopenia that was considered
attributable to trametinib by the investigator. On the
basis of safety, PK, and pharmacodynamic data from a trametinib study in solid tumors19 in which dose-limiting
toxicities (grade 3 rash and diarrhea and grade 2 chorioretinopathy) were reported at the 3-mg dose level, a
program-based decision was made by the study sponsor to
select the 2-mg dose as the RP2D despite no additional
dose-limiting toxicity–defining events occurring in this
study. The overall median duration of treatment was 56
days (range, 7-337 days).
Toxicity

Diarrhea was experienced by 52% of the patients (grade
1/2, 48%; grade 3, 4%; and grade 4, 0%). Skin-related
toxicities, including rash, were seen in 57% of the patients
(grade 1, 36%; grade 2, 15%; grade 3, 5%; and grade 4,
0%). Although 15% of the patients experienced blurring

This cohort included patients who received 0.5 mg of trametinib once daily, a 3-mg loading dose of trametinib and 1 mg of trametinib once daily, or 1 mg of
trametinib once daily.
b
There were 6 patients identified as being positive for both NRAS and KRAS mutations.

of vision, visual acuity was reduced in 4%, and central serous retinopathy was not seen.
The study mandated periodic assessments of the cardiac ejection fraction (EF) at the baseline and every 8 weeks
thereafter. An asymptomatic reduction in EF from the
baseline was seen in 75% of the patients: <20% decrease in
62% and 20% decrease in 13%. In 9% of the patients,
EF dropped to <40%. One event of decreased EF was considered treatment-related (grade 3) and was reversible with
treatment interruption. All other EF changes were not considered drug-related or clinically significant because these
mostly occurred in the setting of infection or sepsis. Grade
2 or greater QT prolongation was reported in 5 patients
(5%) without any related arrhythmia.
Overall, 77 patients (79%) experienced 1 or more
treatment-related adverse events: 46% were grade 1 or 2,
22% were grade 3, 10% were grade 4, and 1% were grade
5. Among these events, the most commonly reported
treatment-related adverse events were diarrhea (30%), rash
(25%), nausea (13%), and elevated alanine aminotransfer1874

ase levels (11%). Treatment-related adverse events are summarized by dose and maximum toxicity in Table 2.
Dose interruptions due to adverse events were
reported in 48% of the patients, with 5% requiring a dose
reduction. Forty percent of the patients with dose interruptions had trametinib treatment resumed at the full
dose after resolution of the event. Three of the events
requiring a dose reduction (rash, left ventricular dysfunction, and elevated aspartate aminotransferase levels) were
reported as treatment-related. Discontinuation of treatment due to adverse events (regardless of attribution)
occurred in 25 patients (26%).
Trametinib Plasma Concentrations

Trametinib was rapidly absorbed, with a median time to
the maximum observed concentration of 1.75 to 3 hours
across all doses (Supporting Table 2 [see online supporting information]) and with a dose-proportional increase
in the area under the plasma concentration-time curve
over the dosing interval but a less than proportional

increase in the maximum observed concentration after 15
days. Trametinib accumulated with repeat dosing (accumulation ratio range, 6.32-11.1) with a mean effective
elimination half-life of approximately 96.4 to 174 hours
(4-7 days; Supporting Table 2). The interpatient coefficient of variation percentage for PK parameter estimates
was generally moderate to high (34.6%-80.3% in the 2mg dose cohort).
The mean predose plasma level of trametinib at 2
mg was 12.22 ng/mL on day 15 of cycle 1 and 10.72 ng/
mL on day 1 of cycle 2. In phase 2, trametinib trough concentrations were similar on day 1 of subsequent cycles in
patients who continued beyond cycle 2, and this indicated
steady-state levels. In general, these levels were above the
target efficacious trough concentration of 10 ng/mL
observed in the first-time-in-human study (Fig. 1).20

Patients in all cohorts received treatment at the recommended phase 2 dose (2 mg once daily).

(range, 1-48 weeks). The median duration of treatment
was 10 weeks (range, 2-37 weeks) in cohort 1, 5 weeks
(range, 1-48 weeks) in cohort 2, and 12 weeks (range, 344 weeks) in cohort 3. Fourteen responses were seen at the
RP2D (Table 3). There were 10 responders with a RAS
mutation in cohort 1 (AML or MDS), 1 responder with a
RAS wild-type or unknown mutation status in cohort 2
(AML, MDS, or CMML), and 3 responders with a RAS
mutation in cohort 3 (CMML).
In cohort 1 (n 5 50), the overall response rate was
20% with 4 CRs (response durations, 4, 8, 14, and 48

CR (response duration, 12 weeks), 3 morphological

overall response rate was 27% in cohort 3 (n 5 11) with 1
CR, 1 CRp, and 1 marrow CR with response durations of

[CI], 4.4-11.5 months) and 5.2 months for the 48 nonresponders (95% CI, 4.0-6.0 months; Fig. 2). The median
OS for the patients with MDS or AML who had RAS
mutations (cohort 1, 4.9 months; 95% CI, 4.0-5.7
months) was similar to that for the patients with MDS or
AML without RAS mutations (cohort 2, 3.0 months;
1876

95% CI, 1.8-7.4 months; Fig. 2). Additional biological
activity of trametinib as evidenced by a 50% reduction
in bone marrow blasts was seen in 34%, 7%, and 36% of
the patients in cohorts 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Similar
reductions  50% in peripheral blasts were reported in
54% (cohort 1), 30% (cohort 2), and 45% (cohort 3) of
patients.
Six responding patients (all from The University of
Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center) had DNA samples
available at enrollment and follow-up for next-generation
sequencing for a limited set of cancer-relevant genes.
None acquired FLT3, KIT, or NPM1 mutations. One
patient acquired 1 mutation each in PTPN11 and FLT1,
and another acquired a mutation in WT1.
Statistical Consideration

Response rates of 20% (95% CI, 8.9%-31%) and 27%
(95% CI, 1.0%-54%) in cohorts 1 and 3, respectively,
were deemed to be of sufficient clinical importance with a
posterior probability of success of 1. Accrual to cohort 2
was stopped after the enrollment of 30 patients because of
a lack of efficacy, with a 3% response rate and a posterior
probability of success of 0.39.
DISCUSSION
This is the first study linking clinical responses of a
MEK1/MEK2 inhibitor to RAS mutations in myeloid
malignancies. Single-agent trametinib activity in the
relapsed/refractory setting underscores the relevance of
MAPK signaling in RAS-mutated myeloid malignancies.
Although the strongest activity was seen in the CMML

(A) An ad hoc analysis was conducted to summarize the OS of responders (median, 6.6 months; 95% CI, 4.4-11.5 months) and nonresponders (median, 5.2 months; 95% CI, 4.0-6.0 months) with a RAS mutation.

cohort, early closure of this cohort due to slow accrual
impaired a more robust evaluation of activity. The PK
assessment indicated that the trametinib trough concentration, above the effective biological concentration as
predicted by preclinical studies, was achieved consistently
at the RP2D. These results are consistent with trametinib
activity in metastatic melanoma, in which most activity
has been seen in the subgroup of patients with BRAF
mutations.20-22

rhea was frequent, but dose interruptions or
discontinuations due to diarrhea were seldom needed.
Although left ventricular EF reductions were of concern,
only 6% of the patients experienced grade 3 or 4 events.
Ocular toxicity was limited, with no events of retinal vein
occlusion or central serous retinopathy reported. Trametinib was also successfully resumed in half of the patients
with significant treatment-related liver enzyme elevations.
The responses among patients with NRAS or KRAS
mutations are comparable to responses with other kinase
inhibitors in the setting of AML/MDS with relevant

mutations.23 However, a higher response rate among
patients with RAS mutations did not translate into a survival benefit for those with RAS mutations or those who
responded. The limited duration of the responses indicates that kinase mutations such as RAS mutations emerge
later during leukemogenesis; this is supported by recent
studies of the AML genome.24-26 Because many of the
patients in this study were refractory to multiple therapies,
it was very likely that multiple subclones with variable dependence on MAPK activation were in existence at treatment initiation. The lack of RAS allelic burden data in
this study limits a definitive assessment of such subclones.
Whether additional mutations in the RAS gene or complementary pathways emerge at the time of the loss of
response to trametinib is currently being investigated.
Because epigenetic mutations are considered early
mutations in myeloid leukemias, epigenetic modulators
(eg, hypomethylating agents) with MEK inhibitors could
potentially improve the rate and duration of responses.
The promising activity of hypomethylating agents plus
FLT3 inhibitors in FLT3-mutated AML supports this
notion.27 Because hypomethylating agents (ie, decitabine
and 5-azacitidine) are already approved for frontline treatment of MDS, CMML, and AML (in elderly patients),
such combination trials should ideally be conducted in
the frontline setting to have the maximum impact.
In summary, trametinib has shown single-agent activity in patients with RAS-mutated myeloid malignancies. Treatment combinations based on a better
understanding of the hierarchical importance of mutational events in myeloid malignancies and use in frontline
therapy will likely extend and expand the role of trametinib in myeloid malignancies.
