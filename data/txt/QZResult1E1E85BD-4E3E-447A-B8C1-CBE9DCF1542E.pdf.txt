ABSTRACT
Despite multimodal therapies, a high percentage of high-risk neuroblastoma (NB)
become refractory to current treatments, most of which interfere with cell cycle and
DNA synthesis or function, activating the DNA damage response (DDR). In cancer,
this process is frequently altered by deregulated expression or function of several
genes which contribute to multidrug resistance (MDR). MicroRNAs are outstanding
candidates for therapy since a single microRNA can modulate the expression of
multiple genes of the same or different pathways, thus hindering the development
of resistance mechanisms by the tumor. We found several genes implicated in the
MDR to be overexpressed in high-risk NB which could be targeted by microRNAs
simultaneously. Our functional screening identified several of those microRNAs
that reduced proliferation of chemoresistant NB cell lines, the best of which was
miR-497. Low expression of miR-497 correlated with poor patient outcome. The
overexpression of miR-497 reduced the proliferation of multiple chemoresistant NB
cell lines and induced apoptosis in MYCN-amplified cell lines. Moreover, the conditional
expression of miR-497 in NB xenografts reduced tumor growth and inhibited vascular
permeabilization. MiR-497 targets multiple genes related to the DDR, cell cycle,
survival and angiogenesis, which renders this molecule a promising candidate for
NB therapy.

INTRODUCTION

NB patients are assigned to three different risk categories
according to clinicopathologic variables such as age at
diagnosis, MYCN oncogene amplification, tumor histology
and DNA ploidy. Overall survival for low-risk patients
is excellent; minimal intervention is required and, on
occasions, surgery alone suffices. Intermediate-risk patients
generally have good prognosis and are treated with surgery
and standard chemotherapy. However, high-risk patients
have poor prognosis and need intense chemotherapeutic

Neuroblastoma (NB) is an extracranial neoplasm
originating in the neural crest lineage of the sympathetic
nervous system. It is considered an embryonal cancer [1] and
occurs mainly in children between 0 and 4 years of age. NB
has an incidence in Europe and North-America of 10.5 cases
per million in children and adolescents and accounts for
12 to 15% of all cancer-related deaths in children [2, 3].

regimens. Despite the aggressive treatment, 50–60% of
these patients will not achieve long-term cure owing to
disease progression and resistance to current therapies [4–7].
Acquired drug resistance is often characterized by multiple
drug resistance (MDR), which is defined as insensitivity of
cancer cells to cytotoxic and cytostatic action of a number
of structurally and functionally unrelated chemotherapeutic
agents [8]. In general, this MDR is a major obstacle to the
success of chemotherapy. Some key elements have been
shown to participate in the MDR process in NB, and include
the increased expression of oncogenes such as MYCN,
TrkB/BDNF signaling, or alterations in the DNA damage
response (DDR) elements such as p53 [9–12], CHEK1 [13]
or PLK1 [14, 15], among others. It has also been
demonstrated that major elements of the apoptotic
signaling cascade, including BCL2 family members,
survivin and caspase-8 present abnormal expression or
activation patterns [16, 17]. In addition, acquired resistance
to chemotherapeutic agents may be produced by enhanced
drug efflux due to overexpression of membrane transporters
[18, 19].
Owing to the multiple mechanisms that lead to
NB resistance to therapy, targeting single elements of a
pathway may not suffice. In this respect, it is desirable
to find molecules, such as microRNAs, that can regulate
multiple cellular processes, thereby minimizing the
risk of resistance and improving the clinical response.
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous small non-coding
RNAs that regulate gene expression by direct binding
to the 3′untranslated (UTR) region of mRNAs, blocking
their translation and/or inducing their degradation [20].
MiRNAs are upstream regulators that can simultaneously
target large numbers of protein-coding genes and multiple
cancer pathways. Emerging cumulative data reveal
functional roles of miRNAs in the origin and progression
of NB [21]. Recently, an overall reduction in miRNAs was
observed in advanced NB, mainly due to alterations in the
miRNA processing machinery [22]. Therefore, miRNA(s)
restoration represents an attractive novel therapeutic
approach against aggressive tumors that do not respond to
conventional chemotherapies.
In order to select the best miRNA candidates, we
sought to analyze the expression levels of the MDRrelated genes in human NB samples and select those that
were highly expressed in the most aggressive NBs (Stage 4,
MYCN-amplified tumors). 3′UTR analysis of those
genes revealed that most of them contain binding sites for
various miRNAs in their sequence. Those miRNAs that
were capable of targeting 3 or more MDR-altered genes
simultaneously were then selected for functional analysis
in cellular and animal models of chemoresistant NB.
Our strategy permitted the identification of miR-497, the
restoration of which impairs cellular proliferation in vitro
and in vivo. MiR-497 can be a new therapeutic tool for NB
therapy due to its ability to target multiple genes related to
cell cycle, cell survival, and angiogenesis regulators.

Several DNA-damage response and
detoxification-associated genes are overexpressed
in advanced neuroblastoma
The expression of the most important MDRassociated genes (DDR mediators and pumps and
detoxification genes) was analyzed in different stages
of human NB tumors [23] and whether they could be
simultaneously targeted by miRNAs was explored
(Figure 1A). Twenty-three out of forty-five genes were
found to be overexpressed in the worst prognosis NB group
(Stage 4, MYCN amplified) (Supplementary Table 1).
Analysis of the 3′UTR of the overexpressed genes
showed almost all of them to being susceptible to be
regulated by miRNAs. Twenty-eight different miRNAs
were found to be potential regulators of at least 3
different analyzed genes (Supplementary Table 2)
by at least two independent miRNA-binding site
prediction algorithms (i.e. TargetScan [24], PicTar [25]
and miRANDA [26]).

The miR-15 family member miR-497 has the
highest therapeutic potential
The effects of miRNA expression listed in
Supplementary Table 2 were evaluated in two different
NB cell lines derived from tumors resistant to currentlyused chemotherapeutic drugs (i.e. cisplatin, etoposide,
melphalan) at clinically-achievable doses in children [27].
MiRNAs were reverse-transfected into CHLA-90 and SKN-BE(2) NB cell lines and proliferation was evaluated
at 96 h post-transfection. Figure 1B shows that 4 of 28
miRNAs (miR-185, miR-101, miR-34a and miR-497)
did significantly reduce the number of cells of both cell
lines compared to MOCK-transfected cells or versus nontargeting miRNA (miR-Control), with miR-497 being the
miRNA with the clearest effects in both NB cell lines.
MiR-497 belongs to the miR-15 family which
has five additional members (miR-15a, miR-15b,
miR-16-1/2, miR-195 and miR-424); all share the
same seed region, and thereby potentially regulate
a similar pool of targets (Supplementary Table 3).
When the expression of the miR-15 family
members was analyzed in human NB tissues
(n = 328), the low expression of miR-15a, miR-195, miR497 and miR-424 correlated with worse progression-free
survival (Figure 2A). Tumors from patients with MYCN
amplification (poor outcome) also showed reduced levels
of miR-195, miR-497 and miR-424 (Supplementary
Figure 1). These data suggest that replacement of miR-15
family members could be exploited therapeutically. In
order to clarify whether the diverse family members
could have different therapeutic potential, we compared
the effects of transfecting all 6 individual miRNAs on the

started to be visible in all cell lines at 72 h posttransfection (Figure 3A).
To further ascertain whether the effects of miR-497
were due to a reduction in cell proliferation and/or
increased cell death, the induction of apoptosis was
analyzed in miR-497-transfected cells. The number of
cells with condensed or fragmented chromatin (one of the
hallmarks of apoptotic cell death) was found to be increased
upon miR-497 transfection in MYCN-amplified (SKN-BE(2) and LA1-5s) but not in MYCN-non amplified
cell lines (CHLA-90 and SK-N-AS) (Figure 3B–3C).
Furthermore, the implication of caspases in miR-497-

significance was determined by two-tailed unpaired Student’s t-test comparing each miRNA versus miR-Control. P-values for the CHLA90 cell line are miR-185: 0.00012, miR-101: 4.55 × 10−05, miR-34a: 0.00028 and miR-497: 4.13 × 10−07. P-values for the SK-N-BE(2) cell

induced cell death was confirmed with a caspase activity
assay (Figure 3D) and the cleavage of caspase-3/7
substrate PARP (Figure 3E).
In summary, our results show that the sole ectopic
expression of miR-497 suffices to reduce the proliferation
of all tested chemoresistant NB cell lines and induce cell
death in MYCN-amplified NB cells.

in the doxycycline-treated arm did so (Figure 5A),
possibly indicating specific effects of miR-497 expression
in the tumor vasculature. This effect was further visible
when tumors were dissected (Figure 5B). Histologic
analysis revealed extensive hemorrhagic areas in the
control group (Figure 5C) and few red blood cells in
the parenchyma of miR-497-overexpressing tumors.
The presence of red blood cells not exclusively inside
or in the proximity of blood vessels results from high
permeability of tumor blood vessels, a common trait of
human NB. Additionally, the number and area of blood
vessels were measured. Although a trend was observed
towards a reduction in blood vessel area in miR-497overexpressing tumors, differences did not reach
statistical significance (Figure 5D).
In summary, the overexpression of miR-497 in vivo
resulted in reduced tumor growth and less permeability of
blood vessels.

MiR-497 overexpression reduces tumor growth
and vascular permeability
Since our data pointed to a therapeutic potential of
miR-497 against refractory NB, we proceeded to engineer
an inducible miR-497 expression system to evaluate the
effects of miR-497 expression in vivo. The precursor
form of miR-497 (pre-miR-497, accession # MI0003138)
was cloned into the Tet-On lentiviral inducible vector
(pTRIPZ, Thermo) which provides inducible expression
of the miRNA in the presence of doxycycline. SK-NBE(2) cells were transduced with either pTRIPZ-Control
or pTRIPZ-miR-497 and stable cells were selected with
puromycin. The addition of different concentrations
of doxycycline (0.1–1 µg/ml) to the culture media of
pTRIPZ-miR-497-transduced cells induced miR-497
overexpression, obtaining the highest overexpression at
0.5 µg/ml (~40-fold) (Supplementary Figure 2A). The
miR-497-expressing cells can be monitored by following
the red fluorescent protein (Supplementary Figure 2B).
The functional consequences of miR-497 overexpression
were evaluated in proliferation and colony-formation
assays. Concurring with our previous observations, the
doxycycline-mediated induction of miR-497 dramatically
reduced the proliferation and colony-formation capability
of SK-N-BE(2) cells while doxycycline itself did not have
any effect (Figure 4A–4C). These results were confirmed
in the MYCN-amplified cell line LA1-5s (Supplementary
Figure 3).
Next, we established NB tumors by the
subcutaneous injection of 5 × 106 SK-N-BE(2) cells
previously transduced with the pTRIPZ-miR-497 vector,
into the right flank of NMRI-nude mice (Figure 4D).
Once tumors were detected (day 4–5 post-injection),
mice were randomized into two groups; while the control
group received vehicle (2% sucrose), the miR-497 group
received 1mg/ml doxycycline and 2% sucrose in drinking
water ad libitum. Tumor volume was monitored every
2–3 days over a three-week period. The overexpression of
miR-497 in the presence of doxycycline showed a ~2–3
fold reduction in tumor growth (day 20–22) (Figure 4E)
and tumor weight (Figure 4F) compared to doxycyclineuntreated mice. PCR analysis confirmed the activation
of miR-497 expression by doxycycline (Supplementary
Figure 2C).
During the course of the experiment, the majority
of mice bearing NB xenografts without doxycycline
displayed hemorrhagic tumors whereas none of the tumors

MiR-497 targets several cell cycle, survival and
angiogenesis genes
The miR-15 family members were initially selected
in this study owing to their potential for targeting several
chemoresistance-associated genes such as CHEK1,
CDC25A, WEE1 and ABCC5. We proceeded to verify
whether these genes were truly modulated by miR-497
overexpression in the neuroblastoma context. We decided to
include other potential targets in the analysis that could also
be related to the observed phenotype such as BCL2, AKT3
and VEGFA. The transient overexpression of miR-497
in SK-N-BE(2) and LA1-5s (MYCN amplified) cell lines
(Figure 6A–6B, right panels) proved to cause a reduction
in the mRNA levels of WEE1, CHEK1, BCL2, CDC25A
and VEGFA while a reduction in ABCC5 and AKT3 was
observed only in LA1-5s cells 48 h post-transfection
(Figure 6A–6B, left panels). To further confirm whether
the reduction in mRNA was followed by a decrease in
protein levels, a Western blot was performed at different
time-points post-miR-497 transfection. The protein levels
of WEE1, CHEK1, BCL2 and AKT3 were reduced as early
as 48 h upon miR-497 transfection. VEGFA reduction
was much more evident in LA1-5s than in SK-N-BE(2),
perhaps due to different protein stability among cell lines.
By contrast, the levels of CDC25A remained unaltered in
both cell lines (Figure 6C–6D).
Since WEE1 and BCL2 have been reported to be
direct miR-497 targets in NB cells [28, 29], we proceeded
to analyze whether the remaining candidate genes
were also directly modulated by miR-497. CHEK1-,
AKT3- and VEGFA- 3′UTR luciferase-reporter vectors were
engineered and co-transfected with miR-497 or control
mimic oligonucleotides (Figure 7). Significant reduction in
luciferase activity was observed upon miR-497 transfection
for CHEK1, AKT3 and VEGFA 3’UTR vectors, thereby
indicating a direct modulation of these genes by miR-497.

Collectively, these data suggest that miR-497
may regulate proliferation, survival and tumor vascular
permeability by targeting key genes involved in DDR
such as WEE1 and CHEK1, cell growth and viability such
as AKT3 and BCL2 and angiogenesis regulators such as
VEGFA.

and division processes, thereby inducing DNA damage
and, consequently, activating the DNA-damage response
(DDR). The alteration of this process contributes notably
to the multi-drug resistance phenotype and consists of a
well-orchestrated signaling cascade which halts cell cycle
progression and repairs DNA. When DNA damage is
beyond repair, cell death mechanisms are triggered. Genetic
and/or epigenetic alterations of this complex network,
may predispose to cancer, promote tumor progression or
participate in the resistance to current therapies [30].
Outcomes for low- and intermediate-risk NB
patients are excellent, but survival for high-risk NB is
less than 50%. High-risk NB may be initially responsive

DISCUSSION
Resistance to current chemo- and radiotherapy
treatments remains the main cause of cancer treatment
failure. Most of these treatments are aimed at targeting
the most-dividing cells interfering in the cell proliferation

to DNA-damaging therapies; however, most patients
will relapse and be refractory to conventional therapies,
rendering NB a paradigm of chemoresistant tumors [31].
The implication of several DDR elements in the resistance
of NB to therapy has been proposed, with TP53 [32–34],
antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family members such as Bcl-2 [35]
or Bcl-XL [36], and checkpoint regulators [37], being the
most characterized. Therefore, targeting different DDR
components simultaneously may improve the clinical
response of high-risk patients.

MiRNAs are small non-coding RNAs that regulate
gene expression generally by direct binding to the 3′UTR
of their target genes. One of the features that renders
miRNAs striking candidates for therapy is that a single
miRNA can modulate the expression of multiple genes
of the same or different pathways, thus hindering the
development of resistance mechanisms by the tumor.
We propose the use of miRNAs as a new clinical
tool to treat advanced NB that do not respond to current
chemotherapies. We screen the therapeutic potential of

miRNAs that could simultaneously target several MDRrelated genes that are overexpressed in advanced NB
(stage 4 with MYCN amplification). We identified
miR-497 as the most anti-proliferative miRNA in two
representative NB cell lines resistant to currently-used
chemotherapeutic drugs. Low miR-497 expression was
associated with shorter event-free survival and MYCN
amplification in our cohort of human NB samples,
suggesting a tumor-suppressor role. In accordance
with our findings, miR-497 has also been found to be
underexpressed in advanced stages of cancer or when
tumor samples were compared with normal counterpart

tissues, and play a tumor-suppressor role in other
malignancies such as peritoneal [38], adrenocortical [39],
prostate [40] and hepatocellular carcinomas [41, 42];
malignant astrocytoma [43]; neuroblastoma [29]; gastric
[44, 45], cervical [46], bladder [47], pancreatic [48],
ovarian [49], colorectal [50], non-small cell lung cancer
[51], and male [52] and female breast cancer [53–56].
The overexpression of miR-497 reduced the
proliferation of all cell lines analyzed and induced
apoptosis in MYCN-amplified cell lines. Additionally,
we provide the first evidence of antitumoral activity of
miR-497 in a preclinical mouse model of pediatric cancer.

Concurring with our results, in the majority of cellular
models studied, the restoration of miR-497 levels impaired
cell cycle progression and/or induced apoptosis in vitro
and reduced tumor growth in vivo [45, 51, 57, 58]. Among
miR-497 targets, multiple cell cycle regulators such as
CCNE1, CDC25A, CCND3, CDK4 [41] or proteins
involved in apoptosis such as BCL2 [44], BCL-w [54] and
BIRC5 [47] have been described. In NB, only the WEE1
G2 checkpoint kinase has been recently identified [29].
We observed a downregulation of cell cycle
regulators (CHEK1 and WEE1), cell survival proteins
(AKT3 and BCL2) and the vascular permeability factor
(VEGFA) after miR-497 overexpression and all have been
identified as direct miR-497 targets.
One of the targets most affected by the ectopic
expression of miR-497 was CHEK1. This cell cycle
regulator was also found to be a plausible therapeutic
target in NB by RNAi screening of several protein kinases
[13]. We found CHEK1 to be highly expressed in advanced
NB stages, with higher levels in MYCN-amplified tumors
and a clear correlation between high CHEK1 mRNA
levels and shorter progression-free and overall survival
(Supplementary Figure 4A–4D). An inverse correlation
was observed between the mRNA levels of CHEK1
and miR-497 in human NB tumors (Supplementary
Figure 4E). Interestingly, simultaneous pharmacologic
inhibition of CHEK1 and WEE1, both miR-497 targets,
acted synergistically to impair neuroblastoma cell growth
in vitro and in vivo [59], further demonstrating the
therapeutic potential of miR-497.
AKT is the central component of the PI3K/AKT/
mTOR pathway which is often hyperactivated in NB
tumors [60]. This kinase is able to phosphorylate and
regulates the function of a plethora of substrates that
are critical for growth, proliferation, survival and
angiogenesis, among other cellular processes [61]. There
are three AKT isoforms which may play different roles
in human cancer [62]. Particularly, AKT3 is abundantly
expressed in the nervous system and has been associated
with the development of neural crest-derived tumors
such as melanoma [63] or involved the progression of
gliomas through activation of the DNA repair pathway
[64]. Interestingly, AKT3 has been shown to modulate
angiogenesis through the control of VEGFA expression
[65], another of our miR-497-identified targets. Therefore,
the downregulation of AKT3 and VEGFA, both of the
same axis, may ensure a reduction in the production
and secretion of VEGFA. In our established xenografts,
the inducible expression of miR-497 was able to reduce
tumor growth and the permeability of blood vessels.
This latter effect could be particularly relevant for cancer
therapy. A disorganized and leaky blood vessel network is
frequently found in solid tumors and drives tumor-induced
angiogenesis, blood flow disturbances, inflammatory cell
infiltration, and tumor cell extravasation. Moreover, it can
limit the efficacy of conventional therapies by impairing

intravenous drug delivery. It is now accepted that not
only excessive angiogenesis should be controlled but also
vascular hyperpermeability [66]. High vascularization
is associated with poor prognosis in NB [67] and
combined treatments with anti-angiogenic agents showed
promising benefits in preclinical models. Bevacizumab
is a humanized monoclonal anti-VEGF antibody that
neutralizes all isoforms of human VEGF. Dickson et al.
reported that bevacizumab-mediated VEGF blockade
caused alterations in tumor vessel physiology that
permitted improved delivery and efficacy of chemotherapy
[68, 69].
The use of miRNAs as therapeutic tools has
recently entered in clinical development. One of the major
challenges for miRNA-based therapies is to improve
miRNA delivery, bioavailability and specific targeting to
tumoral cells. In the field of oncology, the first molecule
to enter in a phase I clinical trial was MIRX34 [70].
This compound is a double-stranded RNA mimic of the
tumor suppressor microRNA, miR-34, encapsulated in a
liposomal nanoparticle formulation. A limitation of this
formulation is that when administered intravenously, its
distribution is concentrated mainly in the liver, where it
is very effective, but is metabolized and excreted quickly,
limiting its therapeutic potential in less irrigated tissues
[71]. In order to improve the specific targeting to tumoral
cells, a recently-open phase I clinical trial sponsored by
the University of Sidney, propose the use of miR-15/16
mimics packaged in EDV™ nanocells targeted
with Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor antibodies
(TargomiRs) for the treatment of patients with recurrent
malignant pleural mesothelioma and non-small cell lung
cancer [72].
The downregulation of multiple DDR-related
targets by a single miRNA, make miR-497 as a good
therapeutic candidate not only as a monotherapy, but also
in combination with current treatments. For example,
miR-497 overexpression was reported to increase
cisplatin-induced apoptosis in NB cell lines [29] or reduce
the resistance to cisplatin in ovarian cancer using in vitro
and in vivo models [58]. In line with the same evidence,
high levels of miR-497 were found to be associated
with better prognosis due to increased chemosensitivity
in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) patients. In
this study, ectopic expression of miR-497 in DLBCL cell
lines led to a reduction on cell viability after exposure
to rituximab and different chemotherapeutics relevant in
multi-agent lymphoma therapy [73].
In summary, our findings unveil miR-497 as a
tumor-suppressor molecule in NB. The restoration of
miR-497 may represent a novel and feasible therapeutic
approach to treat high-risk NB by downregulating the
expression of key proteins involved in DDR such as the
cell cycle regulators WEE1 and CHEK1, cell growth and
survival, AKT3 and BCL2 and the vascular permeability
regulator VEGFA.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Hospital (Ghent, Belgium), the Academic Medical Center
(AMC; Amsterdam, Netherlands) and the University
Children’s Hospital Essen (Essen, Germany). This
work was approved by the Research Ethics Committee
of each participating institute. Informed consent was
obtained from the patients’ relatives. The investigators
who deposited the data in the R2 repository agree to
share the data for this work. Patient characteristics are
listed in Supplementary Table 4. Tumors were profiled
for 430 miRNAs plus 36 control small RNAs using
individual Taqman PCR assays setup in 384-well format
and mRNA gene expression profile was performed by
Affymetrix GeneChip HG-U133plus2.0. The data set has
been previously described in a number of publications
[74–78]. Kaplan-Meier analysis was carried out using the
scan function of the R2 data analysis tool at the University
of Amsterdam (http://R2.amc.nl). The R2 Kaplan-Meier
scanner for a single miRNA split the group in two and
produced a graph containing 2 p-values. A raw p-value
represented the log rank statistical significance. A
Bonferroni corrected p-value indicated the significance in
survival potential.

Cell lines
CHLA-90 cell line was obtained from the Children’s
Oncology Group cell line repository. SK-N-BE(2), LA1-5s
and SK-N-AS cell lines were purchased from ATCC.
All cell lines obtained directly from the tissue banks
were amplified and stored in liquid nitrogen. Upon
resuscitation, cells were maintained in culture for no
more than 2 months. All cell lines were cultured and
maintained in Iscove’s Modified Dulbecco’s Medium
(Life Technologies, Thermo Fisher Scientific),
supplemented with 20% heat-inactivated FBS (South
America Premium, Biowest), 1% Insulin-TransferrinSelenium G Supplement (Life Technologies, Thermo
Fisher Scientific), 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 μg/mL
streptomycin (Life Technologies, Thermo Fisher
Scientific) and 5 µg/ml of Plasmocin Prophylactic
(InvivoGen). All cultures were maintained at 37°C in a
saturated atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2.

Cell proliferation (crystal violet)

Cell death and caspase activity

Liposomal transfection complexes without
miRNA (MOCK) or with miRIDIAN microRNA Mimic
oligonucleotides, Negative Control or Transfection
Control with Dy547 (Dharmacon, GE Healthcare,
25 nM per well) were generated with Lipofectamine
2000 (Life technologies, Thermo Fisher Scientific,
0.2 µL per well) in 96-well plates (6 replicates/condition)
following the manufacturer’s recommendations.
Cells were seeded at specific densities (SK-N-BE(2)
10 × 103 cells/well, LA1-5s 5 × 103 cells/well, SK-N-AS
8 × 103 cells/well, CHLA-90 16 × 103 cells/well) into wells
containing liposomal complexes followed by overnight
incubation in a humidified incubator at 37°C and 5% CO2.
Media were changed 12–16 h later. At the indicated time
points, cells were fixed with 1% glutaraldehyde (SigmaAldrich) in PBS for 20 min and stored in PBS at 4°C. At
the end of the experiment, cells were stained with 0.5%
crystal violet (Sigma-Aldrich) for 20 min followed by
extensive washing with diH2O. Crystals were dissolved
with 15% acetic acid (Fisher Scientific) and optical
density was read at 590 nm using an Epoch Microplate
Spectrophotometer (Biotek).

CHLA-90, SK-N-AS, LA1-5s and SK-N-BE(2)
cells were seeded at 105 × 103, 54 × 103, 35 × 103 and
67 × 103 cells/24 well-plates, respectively. Cells were
reverse transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 with
miRIDIAN microRNA Mimic Negative Control and
miRIDIAN microRNA Mimic miR-497 (25 nM) in
triplicate and 6–8 h later media were changed. 96 h
post-transfection, cell death was analyzed by Hoechst
staining. Apoptosis quantification was made from
4 representative images/well (n = 3 replicates per
condition). Cells with uniformly stained chromatin were
scored as healthy whereas those with fragmented and/or
condensed chromatin were scored as apoptotic.
For caspase-3/7 activity assays, SK-N-BE(2) and
LA1-5s cells were seeded in 60-cm dishes and reverse
transfected with 25 nM of Negative Control or miR-497
oligonucleotides in triplicate. At 72 h post-transfection,
cells were harvested and incubated for 15 minutes on
ice with caspase-activity buffer (20 mM HEPES/NaOH
pH 7.2, 10% sucrose, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 1%
Nonidet P-40, 0.1% CHAPS and 1x EDTA-free complete
protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche)). Lysates were
cleared by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 5 min at 4°C,
and supernatants were quantified by the Lowry method
(Bio-Rad). Assays were performed in triplicate using
15–25 µg of protein in the same lysis buffer supplemented
with 10 mM DTT and 25 µM of the fluorogenic caspase-3
substrate Ac-DEVD-AFC (Calbiochem). Plates were read
in an Appliskan (Thermo Fisher Scientific) microplate
reader using a 405 nm excitation filter and a 535 nm
emission filter.

Analysis of miRNA expression in human samples
Gene and miRNA expression data from
neuroblastoma tumors was obtained from the Tumour
Neuroblastoma Compendium (NRC) dataset. A total of 365
neuroblastoma samples were obtained and analyzed from
patients enrolled by Our Lady’s Hospital for Sick Children
(Crumlin, Dublin, Ireland), the Children’s Oncology
Group (Philadelphia, USA), the Ghent University

Plasmids, lentivirus production and transduction

Immunohistochemistry

pTRIPZ was purchased from Open Biosystems
(Dharmacon, GE Healthcare). To generate the
miR-497 expression vector, a fragment of 184
bp of pre-miR-497 was amplified by PCR (Fw:
5′- GTTAACCTTCCCAGCACTGCTATGTG-3′ and Rv:
5′-CTCGAGTGTCAACTTCTCCAGGATGG-3′) from
genomic DNA and cloned directly into the pTRIPZ-empty
vector using HpaI/XhoI restriction sites. Lentiviruses were
propagated using previously described methods [79, 80].
SK-N-BE(2) and LA1-5s cells were seeded in 100 mmdishes and incubated overnight prior to infection. Medium
was replaced with viral supernatant supplemented with 5
µg/mL polybrene, and incubated for 24 h, followed by
replacement with growth medium. pTRIPZ-Control or
pTRIPZ-miR-497 stably-transduced SK-N-BE(2) and
LA1-5s cells were selected with 1 µg/mL puromycin
(Sigma-Aldrich) prior to use in experiments.

Vascularization was determined by a standard
immunohistochemistry method in tissue sections using
an anti-CD31 (PECAM1) antibody (ab28364, Abcam)
and Envision anti-Rabbit HRP-conjugated secondary
antibody complex (Dako). Hemorrhaging was determined
by developing endogenous tissue peroxidase (mostly from
red blood cells) using DAB precipitate deposition (Dako).
Quantification of both vascularization and hemorrhaging
was made from 3 representative images of 4 independent
tumors per group, by determining area density (area
positive for marker by total viable tumor area) using
Image J software (NIH USA, open-source, public domain
software).

Gene expression analysis by quantitative realtime PCR
Total RNA, including the small RNA fraction,
was extracted using the miRNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen).
mRNAs were reverse transcribed (0.5–1 µg total RNA)
using Taqman RT kit (Applied Biosystems, Thermo Fisher
Scientific), and mature miRNA expression analysis was
quantified using Taqman microRNA assays (Applied
Biosystems, Thermo Fisher Scientific) following
manufacturer’s recommendations. cDNA was quantified
by standard RT-qPCR methodology using 2X Power
SYBR Green Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Thermo
Fisher Scientific). Gene expression was normalized against
the L27 housekeeping gene for mRNA, and U6 or RNU-44
small RNA for miRNA analysis. The primer sequences are
listed in Supplementary Table 5. The relative fold-change
in expression was determined by the comparative 2(−ΔΔCT)
method [81].

Colony formation assay
pTRIPZ-Control or pTRIPZ-miR-497 stable SK-NBE(2) cells were seeded at 10,000 cells/well and pTRIPZControl or pTRIPZ-miR-497 stable LA1-5s cells were
seeded at 1,000 cells/well in 6-well plates in triplicates
with 0.5 µg/mL of puromycin and with or without
doxycycline (0.5–1 µg/mL). Medium was refreshed every
3 days and cells were allowed to grow for 10–15 days.
Then, cells were stained with crystal violet, photographed
and scored

Cell proliferation assay (cell counting)
pTRIPZ-Control or pTRIPZ-miR-497 stable SKN-BE(2) cells were seeded at 250,000 cells and pTRIPZControl or pTRIPZ-miR-497 stable LA1-5s cells were
seeded at 50,000 cells into 35 mm-dish with 0.5 µg/mL of
puromycin and with or without doxycycline (0.5–1 µg/mL).
Cells were counted and reseeded at days 3, 6 and 9
(n = 3/condition).

Western blot
Cell homogenates were obtained in RIPA buffer
(Pierce, Thermo Scientific), supplemented with
1 × EDTA-free complete protease inhibitor cocktail
(Roche). Protein concentration was quantified by a
modified Lowry assay (DC protein assay; Bio-Rad).
30 µg of protein were resolved in NuPAGE 4-12% BisTris gels and transferred to iBlot Gel Transfer Stacks
PVDF membranes (Life Technologies, Thermo Fisher
Scientific). After blocking with Tris-buffered saline with
Tween-20 containing 5% non-fat dry milk or 5% BSA
for 1 h at room temperature, membranes were probed
overnight at 4°C with the following antibodies: anti-PARP
[1:2000, Cell Signaling #9542]; anti-CDC25A [1:1000,
Santa Cruz #sc-7389]; anti-WEE1 [1:1000, Santa Cruz
#sc-5285]; anti-CHK1 [1:2000, Santa Cruz #sc-8408];
anti-BCL2 [1:1000, Dako #M0887]; anti-AKT3 [1:1000,
Upstate #05-780]; anti-VEGF [1:1000, Abcam #ab46154];
anti-Mouse IgG-Peroxidase antibody produced in rabbit
(1:10.000, Sigma-Aldrich #A9044); anti-Rabbit IgG-

Mouse xenograft
SK-N-BE(2) cells transduced with pTRIPZmiR-497 (n = 20) were injected (5 × 106 cells/flank) into
the right flank of 6–8-week-old female NMRI-nude mice
(Janvier Labs, Le Genest-Saint-Isle, France). Cells were
injected in 300 µl of PBS:Matrigel (Corning) (1:1). Once
tumors were detected (day 4–5 post-injection), mice were
randomized into two groups (n = 10/group). Doxycycline
(1 mg/mL) was added (n = 10, miR-497 group) or not
(n = 10, control) to the drinking water with 2% sucrose
(Sigma-Aldrich). Tumor volume was measured every
2–3 days for three weeks. At the end of the experiment, the
primary tumors were excised and weighed. Tissues were
fixed in 10% formalin, and paraffin-embedded.

Luciferase 3′UTR assays
psiCHECK™-2 vector was purchased from
Promega. psiCHECK2-CHEK1 3′UTR construct
was acquired from Addgene (plasmid 29478, [82]).
pLightSwitch vector and pLightSwitch-AKT3 3′UTR
were kindly provided by Doug Hanniford and Eva
Hernando (NYU Langone Medical Center). psiCHECK2VEGFA 3′UTR vector was generated by amplifying a
512bp fragment of the VEGFA 3′UTR by PCR (Fw:
5′-CTCGAGGAACCAGATCTCTCACCAGGA-3′ and
Rv: GCGGCCGCTCTCCTCCTCTTCCCTGTCA-3′)
and cloned into the psiCHECK2™-2 vector using XhoI
and NotI restriction sites.
HEK293T cells were seeded in 96-well plates
at 20,000 cells/well in 100 µL/well of complete
media without antibiotic. Cells were co-transfected
16–24 h later using Lipofectamine 2000 with 50 ng
of psiCHECK2-CHEK1 3′UTR, pLightSwitch-AKT3
3′UTR or psiCHECK2-VEGFA 3′UTR vector and 25 nM

complexes containing 3′UTR and liposomal Mimic
miRNAs were prepared separately in 50 µL volume and
then added consecutively to 96-well seeded HEK293T
cells. Cells were incubated at 37°C and 5% CO2 for
20–24 h. Luciferase assay was performed using the
Dual-Glo® Luciferase Assay System (Promega) for
psiCHECK2 constructs and LightSwitch Luciferase Assay
Reagent™ (SwitchGear Genomics) for pLightSwitch
constructs, respectively, following the manufacturer’s
recommendations. Luminescence was measured in
an Appliskan (Thermo Fisher Scientific) microplate
reader. Renilla luciferase activity was normalized to
corresponding firefly luciferase activity (pisCHECK2
constructs) and plotted as a percentage of the control.
