ABSTRACT
Colorectal cancer is the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the United
States. Treatment of colorectal cancer remains a challenge to clinicians as well as
drug developers. Irinotecan, a Camptothecin derivative, is successfully used for the
treatment of this rapidly progressing malignancy and finds its place in the first line of
therapeutic agents. Irinotecan is also effective in treating SCLC, malignant glioma and
pancreatic adenocarcinoma. However, its adverse effects limit its clinical application.
Mainly metabolized by hepatic route, and excreted through biliary tract, this dug has
been found to possess high variation in patients in its pharmacokinetic (PK) profile.
Physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models using compartmental approach
have attained their position to foresee the possible PK behavior of different drugs
before their administration to patients and such models have been proposed for several
anticancer agents. In this work, we used WB-PBPK technology to develop a model in a
population of tumor patients who used IV irinotecan therapy. This model depicted the
concentration of drug and its pharmacologically active metabolite in human body over a
specific period of time. Knowledge about pharmacokinetic parameters is extracted from
this profile and the model is evaluated by the observed results of clinical study presented
in literature. The predicted behavior of the drug by this approach is in good agreement
with the observed results and can aid in further exploration of PK of irinotecan in cancer
patients, especially in those concomitantly suffer from other morbidity.

to minimize toxicity while at the same time maintaining
sufficient drug delivery to tumor cells needed for
effective clinical activity. In recent years, physiologically
based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) approaches have been
successfully applied for the use of anticancer agents.
PBPK modeling is based on an approach which starts
with model building required both in vitro and in vivo data

INTRODUCTION
Pharmacokinetic (PK) evaluation of anticancer
agents is sparsely available in literature because of the
highly inter individual variability exhibited by drugs.
Anticancer drugs frequently show a narrow therapeutic
index (TI), a fact that requires precise dosing in order

followed by model verification. Various PBPK models
have been successfully used for some small molecular
targeting drugs in predicting their exposure to human body
and designing phase I clinical studies [1].
Early from the start of this century, the development
of different models using PBPK modeling and simulation
technique to describe detailed PK/PD data of multiple
drugs is increasingly gaining attention from all aspects
including academia, industry, and regulatory authorities
and has now been established as an advanced approach
for drug exposure-response analysis and clinical trial
simulations [2, 3].
PBPK modeling and simulation technique possesses a
huge potential and aids in efficient mechanistic understanding
of pharmacokinetic as well as pharmacodynamic behavior
of a drug and its metabolites. This understanding enables
therapists to confidently make decisions regarding
therapeutic strategies about clinical scenarios that have not
yet been tested experimentally. Most importantly conducting
population studies using PBPK approaches provides data that
can be used to save time and resources otherwise required for
experimental studies and to make experimental clinical trials
confirmatory rather than exploratory.
In clinical practice, the required therapeutic doses of
almost all anticancer agents are calculated on the basis of
body surface area (BSA). However, it has been reported
that the PK of many anticancer agents are not necessarily
related to BSA [4]. Although the value of BSA-based
dosing is frequently questioned [5], this approach is
commonly practiced [6]. To identify the patient factors
that involve in predicting drug exposure and its ultimate
pharmacodynamic response, population-based evaluations
via simulation approach are carried out [7], that are
extremely useful in the development of appropriate
dosing regimens. In 1998, PK and PK-PD model
implementation had been suggested to revise the dosage
of chemotherapeutic agents after measurement of drug
concentration [8]. In the following decade, Evans et al.
[9] reported that the 5-year survival in children with acute
B-cell lymphoblastic leukemia improved from 66% to
76% by individualizing the dose of methotrexate based on
individual patient’s ability to clear the drug from plasma.
A fully individualized methotrexate dosing in pediatric
patients has also been suggested by other researchers
further improving treatment outcomes [10]. Although a
prospective clinical trial fully powered by modeling and
simulation approach evaluating the outcomes predicted by
this technique compared with standard care dosing system
still awaits to be carried out, there are high expectations
that this approach would be useful in near future to
reduce toxicity while maintaining or even in some cases
improving the treatment efficacy.
Usually, PK models are mainly based on
mathematical mass balance equations that characterize
drug absorption and disposition within the body. The
PBPK models also consider anatomical and physiological
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

realities, taking into account the various differences of
distribution within and among organs in conjunction with
their varying blood flows [11, 12]. A typical whole -body
PBPK approach conceptualizes multiple compartments
representing different organs of the body linked together
by the arterial and venous routes of blood circulation.
Whole-body PBPK models have been reported
in literature for several clinically used antineoplastic
agents, such as methotrexate, 5-fluorouracil, adriamycin,
doxorubicin, and for many newer compounds demonstrating
antitumor activities such as everolimus and genistein
[13, 14]. These models indicate how PBPK models can
be useful in representing mechanistic drug-dependent
features ultimately leading to more accurate predictions
and in providing insights on physiological variables that
can influence a drug disposition and whether concomitantly
given drugs might interact with each other effecting the final
outcome of the therapy.
Colorectal cancer is among one of the most common
and deadly malignancies with an incidence of 1.2 million
new cases per year globally and is estimated to be the third
most common cause of cancer-related deaths in USA [15]. It
has been considered as moderately resistant to chemotherapy.
Though colonoscopic screening has considerably reduced
the death rate of this disease in developed countries, patients
in most under developed and developing countries are
still diagnosed at advanced stages due to the expenses of
colonoscopy added with poor access to health care.
Irinotecan (CPT-11) is a camptothecin derivative which
is metabolized to produce 7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin
(SN-38) after carboxyl esterase-mediated breakdown [16]
(Figure 1). SN-38 is the active metabolite of irinotecan
[17] that inhibits topoisomerase I, a nuclear enzyme that is
essentially required for relaxation of super coiled DNA [18]
and is 100 -1000 times more potent than Itinotecan, inducing
cytotoxic changes and finally causing apoptotic death of the
malignant cells [19, 20]. Further inactivation and metabolism
of SN-38 to SN-38G occurs through hepatic uridine
diphosphate glucuronosyl transferase 1A1 (UGT1A1) [19].
CPT-11received FDA approval in 1998 for the
treatment of metastatic colorectal carcinoma that has
recurred or progressed following treatment with standard
chemotherapy [21]. Avastin and CPT-11 combination
therapy has shown rapid clinical as well as radiographic
improvements in patients with relapsed malignant
glioma. It has been reported that Topoisomerase I and
II activities are significantly enhanced in malignant
gliomas following DNA damage [22] by the single-agent
irinotecan therapy. Irinotecan has also been shown to be
effective in patients with extensive SCLC. New indication
of Irinotecan has been reported in metastatic pancreatic
ductal adenocarcinoma [23].
This paper presents the first detailed PBPK
description of Irinotecan pharmacokinetics in human
tumor patients by developing a PBPK model for irinotecan
IV infusion of 350 mg for 30 minutes. The model

in Figure 3. Figure 4 depicts the comparative plasma
concentrations of SN-38 and water soluble SN-38G
versus time. It is evident from Figures 3 and 4 that SN38 is extensively metabolized by glucuronidated enzyme
presenting greater concentration of SN-38G than SN-38
in plasma. Our physiologically based compartmental
analysis method for predicting human PK yielded good
predictive results and show that these pharmacokinetic
profiles of irinotecan and SN-38 were in agreement with
the observed data. These results indicated the ability of the
model to describe irinotecan and its metabolite exposure in
adults after IV application. Changing the pH environment
of tumor tissue or blood plasma exhibited no detectable
effects on pharmacokinetic parameters of parent drug or
its metabolite as no difference of any degree was noted
for AUC tend, Cmax, half life, plasma clearance, MRT, and
volume of distribution of CPT-11 and SN-38 at different
pH ranges of both blood plasma and tumor tissue.

RESULTS
All results were depicted using standard Pk-Sim
and MoBI graphical output. Numerical evaluation and
visual predictive checks were adapted for comparison of
predicted and clinically observed results. The graphical
representation of plasma-concentration profile of CPT-11
and SN-38 in comparison to the experimentally observed
data in our generated population of patients was shown in

of the mean values of parameters are shown in Table 1,
which are AUC 1296.06 μmol/ min/l, Cmax 9.86 μmol/l.
half life 29.21 h and the tmax 1.5 h. For irinotecan’s active
metabolite SN-38, the mean AUC, Cmax, t ½ and tmax values
calculated for this population were 30.37 μmol/ min/l, 0.07
μmol/l., 19.47h and 1.7h respectively. The prediction of
pharmacokinetics was enabled due to the incorporation
of different physico-chemical properties. Lipophilicity
(Log P), Fraction unbound of drug and PKa values have
shown impact on the prediction of plasma concentration
profile. Log P value determines the ability of drug to
transport through membranes, Fraction unbound of drug
lead to determination of volume of distribution of drug
and PKa has a direct impact on the Lipophilicity and
protein binding of the drug i.e. eventually related to drug
pharmacokinetics [24]. The mean and 5th to 95th percentile
profiles of CPT-11 and SN-38 are shown graphically

DISCUSSION
Malignant tumors often progress rapidly. It is
important to make decisions for drug dose selection,
adjustment and combination of different anticancer agents
in a short period of time. Various anticancer agents are
known to exhibit narrow therapeutic index and high
subject variability. Experimental studies in cancer patient
population to investigate the pharmacokinetics of drugs
during drug development or after clinical application
demand long periods of time, because of many hurdles
such as less number of patient participation, patients’

frequent drop out from ongoing clinical research as a
consequence of deteriorating general physical health
owing to adverse effects of chemotherapeutic agents,
and getting multiple blood samples in already debilitated
patients with possible hematological abnormalities caused
by chemotherapy, among others.
Modeling and simulation approaches make the
envision of complex absorption, distribution, metabolism,
and excretion outcomes of various drugs possible. These
approaches can also predict profiles of parent drugs and
their metabolite in various clinical scenarios. A growing
interest in PBPK models is also the result of its utility in
PK/PD-directed drug development [26, 27]. Simulations
of virtual patient populations through these methods can
save time and resources required by experimental studies
and may play significant role in individualizing the dose

of chemotherapeutic agents, increasing drug efficacy and
desired consequences in every patient. These techniques
also allow the simulation of virtual patient populations
with altered physiological status such as obese/morbidly
obese individuals and patients with renal impairment or
liver cirrhosis.
Our present work is planned to provide a useful
insight in the pharmacokinetic of IV infusion of
Irinotecan in tumor patient population by the use of
specialized physiologically based pharmacokinetic
modeling technique. This work not only gives the plasma
concentration profiles of parent drug irinotecan and its
metabolite SN-38 but also provides their concentrations
in tumor tissue which may provide opportunity for
enhanced insight into pertinent PK thus aiding in design
and adjustment of therapies.

lactone form. The cyclic lactone form of SN-38 represents
the pharmacologic active molecule that is capable to
inhibit topoisomerase while the carboxylate form is
responsible for the toxic side effects of SN-38, especially
diarrhea. Tumor tissue has a lower pH than healthy tissue
or plasma hence the equilibrium shifts to the side of the
hydroxy carboxylate form in tumor tissue.
However, our simulated pharmacokinetic profiles
gained at different pH values of blood plasma and tumor
tissues interprets that pH change in tissues or plasma
does not seem to have any effect on the pharmacokinetic
behavior of the CPT-11 and SN-38 though it is of
significant pharmacodynamic importance.

Using this model for different races of humans
can explore differences that may be present among them
because of possible differences in their genetic makeup. It
has been shown that CPT-11 administration is associated
with hepatotoxicity, an effect that is compounded by
baseline obesity. Patients with a BMI index of >25 were
found twice as much susceptible to developing liver toxicity
than patients with BMI index of 25 or lower. A growing
interest in PBPK modeling techniques is their potentials of
confirming these types of findings or to make predictions
on drug behavior in different morbidities compounded
together, conditions that are frequently encountered during
clinical practice, in a relatively shorter period of time.

CONCLUSIONS

are shown in Table 3. Software MoBi works with PkSim
in synergy and was used for tumor incorporation in this
individual.
A population of 100 individuals comprising of
both male and female patients was created based on
the individuals’ Irinotecan and SN-38 median plasma
concentration-time profile. The 5th and 95th percentile
range was obtained through population simulation using
Pk-Sim. Finally, Pharmacokinetic parameters were
obtained for the resultant profiles and are demonstrated
in Tables 4 and 5. Furthermore, as tumor tissue has been
reported to have a lower pH in comparison with the blood
plasma, pharmacokinetic profiles of CPT-11 and SN38 were also predicted for varying pH ranges of tumor
tissue and blood plasma in order to evaluate the effect
of these changes on pharmacokinetics of CPT-11 and
SN-38. Different pH values between the ranges of 6.0
and 7.5 were selected for tumor tissue and blood plasma
alternatively while keeping one of these at a constant
value. Certain PK parameters such as AUC t-end, Cmax, half
life, plasma clearance, MRT, and volume of distribution
were predicted at these pH environments.

Irinotecan is a potent anticancer agent being the
first line agent in the treatment of multiple oncologic
conditions. As with other chemotherapeutic agents, the
severity and incidence of adverse effects limit its clinical
application. As PBPK modeling has successfully been
applied to assess various untested clinical situations,
the model we developed to understand the behavior of
irinotecan may be used to gain knowledge about potential
exposure changes of this drug in cancer patients with
various co-morbid conditions such as organ failure or
metabolic disorders. In the future, with the availability of
more and more innovative techniques for measuring tissue
drug concentrations, this type of predictive tissue-based
PK modeling may supervene and integrate to medical
fields for delivering better treatment to patients with dose
individualization according to their health status and
increasing the success of chemotherapy.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
The PBPK modeling was established in computer
using the software Pk-Sim 6.0 and MoBi 6.0. Initially,
a virtual whole body PBPK model was developed for
an adult of European race having biometrical values
set according to the ones used in experimental study by
Rivoryet al. [25]. A literature survey was carried out to
collect the physicochemical attributes of irinotecan for
molecular modeling that are shown in Table 2. Irinotecan
(CPT-11) shows complex metabolism, and efforts
have been put to incorporate complete metabolic and
transport processes for CPT-11 and SN-38. The metabolic
conversion of CPT-11 to SN-38 is mainly through carboxyl
esterase. However, CYP3A4 is also involved indirectly in
this process. UGT enzyme family specifically UGT1A1,
UGT1A6, and UGT1A9 further metabolize SN-38 to a
more water soluble product SN-38 G. CPT-11 and SN38 movement from cell to interstitial space and through
bile to intestine is carried out by various transport proteins
which are incorporated in this model development.
Our Irinotecan PBPK modeling uses previously
determined standard human physiological and anatomical
data set for the organ volumes and blood flows. As
irinotecan is eliminated through biliary route, specific
biliary clearance is mentioned in the model development
and kinetics of specific enzymes were incorporated in
the building blocks and the simulation was created by
linking together the individual’s data and molecular data.
The administration dose was set as 350 mg of Irinotecan
intravenous infusion run for 30 minutes according to the
study reported in literature [25]. Plasma concentrationtime profile of irinotecan in this virtual individual was
attained by running the simulation. This predicted profile
was evaluated by applying it to the experimental data of
Rivoryet al [25]. PK parameters of experimental study
