Abstract
NRH:quinone oxidoreductase 2 (NQO2) is a cytosolic flavoprotein that catalyzes the two-electron reduction of quinones and
quinoid compounds to hydroquinones. Although the role of
a homologue, NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), is
well defined in oxidative stress, neoplasia, and carcinogenesis,
little is known about the mechanism of actions of NQO2 in
these cellular responses. Whether NQO2 has any role in tumor
necrosis factor (TNF) signaling was investigated using keratinocytes derived from wild-type and NQO2 knockout (NQO2 / )
mice. Although exposure of wild-type cells to TNF led to
activation of nuclear factor-KB (NF-KB) and IKBA kinase, IKBA
degradation, p65 phosphorylation, and p65 nuclear translocation, this cytokine had no effect on NQO2 / cells. Deletion of
NQO2 also abolished TNF-induced c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase,
Akt, p38, and p44/p42 mitogen-activated protein kinase
activation. The induction of various antiapoptotic gene
products (MMP-9, cyclin D1, COX-2, IAP1, IAP2, Bcl-2, cFLIP,
and XIAP) by TNF was also abolished in NQO2 / cells. This
correlated with potentiation of TNF-induced apoptosis as
indicated by cell viability, Annexin V staining, and caspase
activation. In agreement with this, we also found that TNF
activated NQO2, and NQO2-specific small interfering RNA
abrogated the TNF-induced NQO2 activity and NF-KB activation. Overall, our results indicate that deletion of NQO2 plays
a differential role in TNF signaling pathway: by suppressing
cell survival signals and potentiating TNF-induced apoptosis.

Introduction
NRH:quinone oxidoreductase 2 (NQO2) is a flavoprotein that
catalyzes metabolic reduction of quinones (1–3). It is a homologue
of the well-characterized NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1
(NQO1). The two proteins possess f49% amino acid sequence
identity and have similar substrate specificities, but differ in affinity
for electron-donating cofactors. Although NQO2 is resistant to
typical inhibitors of NQO1, such as dicumarol, NQO2 is inhibited by

flavones such as quercetin and benzo(a)pyrene (1–5). The cDNA
and gene encoding NQO2 were identified from human liver (4, 5).
NQO2 / mice have been shown to develop normally, indicating
that NQO2 is not associated with mouse development (6), but
deletion of the gene has been reported to cause myelogenous
hyperplasia of bone marrow, decrease sensitivity to menadioneinduced hepatic toxicity (6), and increase susceptibility to
benzo(a)pyrene-induced and 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene–
induced skin carcinogenesis (7), suggesting that NQO2 plays an
important role in protection against myelogenous hyperplasia and
in chemoprevention. NQO1 / mice, on the other hand, showed
altered intracellular redox status and altered metabolism of carbohydrates, fatty acids, and nucleotides and reduced accumulation of abdominal fat with age (8). NQO1 / mice, in contrast
to NQO2 / mice, showed increased sensitivity to menadioneinduced hepatic damage (6). Like NQO2 / mice, NQO1 /
mice also developed myelogenous hyperplasia of bone marrow
and increased sensitivity to skin carcinogenesis in response to
benzo(a)pyrene and dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (9).
Although NQO1 protein is expressed in most tumor cells (10–13),
information about expression of NQO2 protein in tumor tissues is
still limited in spite of many studies (5, 14–16). Our previous report
has been shown that the deletion of NQO1 gene potentiates tumor
necrosis factor (TNF)–induced apoptosis through down-modulation
of nuclear factor-nB (NF-nB)–regulated gene products (17). It is
evident that there are more similarities than dissimilarities between
NQO1 and NQO2, and it is plausible to assume that the NQO2 too has
a role in tumorigenesis.
TNF is one of the most potent proinflammatory cytokines. It is
required for maintenance of immune system in normal conditions,
but if it is dysregulated, it is associated with the proliferation,
survival, invasion, angiogenesis, and metastasis of tumors (18). Most
of these TNF effects occur through the activation of NF-nB, activated
protein 1 (AP-1), c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK), p38 mitogenactivated protein kinase (MAPK), p44/p42 MAPK, and Akt (18, 19).
Therefore, our purpose in this study was to determine the role of
NQO2 in TNF cell signaling by using cells derived from NQO2 /
mice. We found that NQO2 was required for the TNF-induced
activation of NF-nB, InBa kinase (IKK), JNK, Akt, p38, and p44/p42
MAPK. We also found that NF-nB–regulated gene products, such as
IAP1, IAP2, XIAP, Bcl-2, cFLIP, cyclin D1, cyclooxygenase (COX)-2,
and metalloproteinase (MMP)-9, were down-regulated by the
deletion of NQO2, which potentiated apoptosis.

serum were obtained from Invitrogen. Anti–h-actin antibody was obtained
from Sigma. The antibodies anti-NQO2 (N-15), anti-NQO1, anti-p65,
anti-InBa, anti-Akt, anti-p44/p42, anti-p38, anti–cyclin D1, anti–MMP-9,
anti–poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), anti-IAP1, anti-IAP2, and anti–
Bcl-2 were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The anti–COX-2
and XIAP antibodies were obtained from BD Biosciences. The phosphospecific anti-p65 (Ser536), phosphospecific anti-Akt (Ser473), phosphospecific
anti-p44/p42 (Thr202/Tyr203; Thr185/Try187), and phosphospecific anti-p38
(Thr180/Tyr182) antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling. Anti–IKK-a,
anti–IKK-h, and anti-cFLIP antibodies were kindly provided by Imgenex.
Cell lines. Keratinocytes derived from benzo(a)pyrene-induced tumors
in wild-type and NQO2-null mice were grown in monolayer by procedures
previously described (17). Briefly, the tumors were removed and placed in
high calcium (200 mmol/L) supplemented with antibiotics and antimitotic
agents. The tumors were exposed to collagenase at 37jC for 2 h with
agitation. The settled clumps were gently removed from the supernatant,
washed twice with high calcium buffer, exposed to high calcium/
keratinocyte growth factor, and plated in the four corner wells of collagen
(Invitrogen)–coated 12-well plates. The medium was replaced with low
calcium (50 mmol/L)/keratinocyte growth factor and replaced every 2 to
3 days. The growing keratinocyte cells were collected and cultured in
DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS, 100 units/mL penicillin, and 100 Ag/mL
streptomycin. The karyotyping analysis did not reveal loss and/or gain or
translocation of chromosome (1) in established skin tumor cells (data not
shown).
NQO2 enzyme activity. NQO2 activity was determined as described
previously (6). In brief, NRH was synthesized by adding 1,000 units of
calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (Sigma) to 500 AL of 10 mmol/L
nicotinamide mononucleotide (Sigma) in PBS. The reaction was allowed to
proceed for 15 min at room temperature. Ten microliters of the NRH were
added to 50 mmol/L Tris (pH 7.4), 100 Amol/L dichlorophenolindophenol,
and cytosolic extract in a 1-mL standard cuvette. Absorbance was
monitored at 600 nm for 1 min with a Beckman DU640 spectrophotometer.
Cytosolic extract concentrations were used that produced a 0.08 to 0.15 A
change/min. This gave us total NQO activity. The same experiment was
repeated in the presence of 10 Amol/L NQO2-specific inhibitor benzopyrene. The activity obtained in the presence of benzopyrene was subtracted
from the total activity to obtain the benzopyrene-inhibitable NQO2 activity.
The specific activity of NQO2 was calculated from the change in
absorbance per microgram of protein. The experiments were independently
repeated thrice.
Small interfering RNA inhibition of NQO2 activity and protein.
Human hepatoblastoma (HepG2) cells were grown in monolayer cultures in
six-well plates in MEM-a supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Lamin
A/C and NQO2 small interfering RNA (siRNA) was purchased from
Dharmacon. The HepG2 cells were transfected with Lamin A/C or NQO2specific siRNA using LipofectAMINE RNAiMAX from Invitrogen by using
the procedure as suggested in the manufacturer’s protocol. The cells were
harvested and homogenized, and nuclear and cytosolic fractions were
prepared using a kit and instruction manual from Active Motif. The
cytosolic fractions were analyzed for NQO2 activity by using a previously
described procedure, and NQO2 protein was analyzed by Western blotting
and probing with anti-NQO2 antibody. The nuclear fractions were analyzed
for NF-nB binding in electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) experiments.
Electrophoretic mobility shift assays. To assess NF-nB activation, we
did EMSA as previously described (20). The dried gels were visualized and
radioactive bands quantitated with a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences) and ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics).
Western blot analysis. To determine the levels of protein expression in
the cytoplasm and the nucleus, we prepared extracts of TNF-treated cells
from each and fractionated them by SDS-PAGE. After electrophoresis, the
proteins were electrotransferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, blotted with
each antibody, and detected by electrochemiluminescence reagents
(Amersham Biosciences). The bands were quantitated with densitometry
(Personal Densitometer Scan v1.30) and ImageQuant software version 3.3
(both from Molecular Dynamics; data not shown).

IKK assay. The IKK assay was done by a method described previously
(17).
3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide
assay. The cell growth effects of TNF were determined by the 3-(4,5dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) uptake method as described. Briefly, 2  104 cells were seeded in triplicate in 96-well
plates, pretreated with cycloheximide for 1 h, and then treated with various
concentrations of TNF for 24 h at 37jC. Thereafter, MTT solution was added
to each well. After a 2-h incubation at 37jC, an extraction buffer (20% SDS
and 50% dimethylformamide) was added; the cells were then incubated
overnight at 37jC, and the absorbance was measured at 570 nm by using a
96-well multiscanner (MRX Revelation; Dynex Technologies).
Annexin V assay. An early indicator of apoptosis is the rapid
translocation and accumulation of the membrane phospholipid phosphatidylserine from the cytoplasmic interface to the extracellular surface. This
loss of membrane asymmetry can be detected by using the binding

Results
We examined the expression of the NQO2 protein in both wildtype (NQO2-WT) and NQO2-null (NQO2 / ) murine keratinocytes.
As expected, NQO2 was expressed in NQO2-WT cells but not in
NQO2 / cells (Fig. 1A). We found no difference in the expression
of TNF receptor (TNFR)-1 and TNFR2 with Western blot analysis in
the two cell types (Fig. 1B).
NQO2 is required for TNF-dependent NF-KB activation. We
first investigated the effect of NQO2 deletion on TNF-induced
NF-nB activation. Cells were stimulated with 0.1 nmol/L TNF for
indicated times; the nuclear extracts were prepared and were then
analyzed for NF-nB activation by EMSA. As shown in Fig. 1C, TNF
stimulated NF-nB activation in a time-dependent manner in NQO2WT, but its activation was completely abrogated in NQO2 / cells.

TNF for the indicated times. Whole-cell extracts were incubated with anti–IKK-a
antibody for 2 h, immunoprecipitated with protein A/G-Sepharose beads
overnight at 4jC, and then analyzed with an immunocomplex kinase assay
using glutathione S -transferase-InB (GST-IjB) as substrate. To examine the
level of expression of IKK proteins, the same whole-cell extracts were resolved
by SDS-PAGE, after which we did a Western blot analysis by using anti–IKK-a
and anti–IKK-h antibodies. C, effects of NQO2 deletion on TNF-induced

times; a cytosol extract was prepared, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and
electrotransferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, after which a Western blot
analysis was done by using anti-phosphospecific p65 antibody. The results
shown are representative of three independent experiments. D, effects of

Annexin V antibody, which was conjugated with FITC fluorescence dye.
Briefly, 1  105 cells were pretreated with 1 Ag/mL cycloheximide, treated
with 1 nmol/L TNF for 16 h at 37jC, and then subjected to Annexin V
staining. Cells were washed in PBS, resuspended in 100 AL of a binding
buffer containing FITC-conjugated anti-Annexin V antibody, and then
analyzed with flow cytometry (FACSCalibur; BD Biosciences).

The Role of NQO2 in TNF-Induced Signaling Pathway

C, siRNA-mediated knockdown of NQO2 .
HepG2 cells were grown in six-well
plates and transfected with either
scrambled or NQO2 -specific siRNA
(25, 50, and 100 nmol/L). After 48 h,
cells were treated with TNF, and cytosolic
fractions were subjected to Western
blotting using anti-NQO2 antibody and to
NQO2 activity following the procedures
as described earlier. D, effect of NQO2
knockdown on NF-nB activity. HepG2
cells were grown in six-well plates and
transfected with either scrambled or
NQO2 -specific siRNA (25, 50, and
100 nmol/L). After 48 h, cells were treated
with 1 nmol/L TNF for 30 min, and
nuclear fractions were subjected to
EMSA to measure NF-nB activation.

Because the activation of NF-nB by TNF is more robust at higher
concentrations (21), we evaluated the effect of NQO2 deletion on
NF-nB activation induced by varying concentrations of TNF. The
activation of NF-nB by TNF in the 0.01 to 1 nmol/L range
was strongly evident in NQO2-WT cells but not in NQO2 / cells
(Fig. 1D). These results indicate that NQO2 is required for
TNF-induced NF-nB activation.

NQO2 is required for TNF-dependent IKBA degradation.
Translocation of NF-nB to the nucleus is preceded by proteolytic
degradation of InBa (22). To determine whether inhibition of
TNF-induced NF-nB activation in NQO2 / cells was due to inhibition of InBa degradation, we exposed cells to TNF for various
intervals and assayed degradation of InBa by Western blot analysis.
TNF induced InBa degradation, reaching maximum at 10 to 30 min

Figure 5. A, effects of NQO2 deletion on expression of NF-nB–regulated
gene products. Cells (5  105 per well) were treated with 1 nmol/L TNF for

after TNF stimulation in NQO2-WT cells (Fig. 2A, left). In NQO2 /
cells, however, TNF had no effect on InBa degradation (Fig. 2A,
right), indicating that NQO2 is required for degradation of InBa.
NQO2 deletion inhibits TNF-induced IKK activation. Given
that IKK is required for TNF-induced NF-nB activation (22), we
investigated the effect of NQO2 deletion on TNF-induced IKK
activation. NQO2 / cells completely lacked TNF-induced activation of IKK, whereas the expression of IKK-a and IKK-h proteins in
both wild-type and null cells was equivalent (Fig. 2B). These results
suggested that NQO2 is required for TNF-induced IKK activation.
NQO2 is required for TNF-induced phosphorylation and
nuclear translocation of p65. Because the degradation of InBa
leads to nuclear translocation of the p65 subunit of NF-nB, we also
analyzed the effect of the NQO2 deletion on TNF-induced nuclear
translocation of p65 with Western blot analysis. In the cytoplasm,

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (20). October 15, 2007

TNF induced phosphorylation of p65 as early as 10 min in NQO2WT cells. After 30 min, the fold of activation was 2.4-fold. In
NQO2 / cells, TNF did not induce the phosphorylation of p65
compared with control (Fig. 2C, top).
As shown in Fig. 2D, TNF also induced translocation of p65 in a
time-dependent manner as early as 10 min after TNF stimulation in
NQO2 -WT cells. In NQO2 / cells, TNF failed to induce
phosphorylation of p65 in nuclei.
NQO2 is required for TNF-induced activation of JNK. We
investigated the role of NQO2 on other signals transduced by TNF.
To examine the specific role of NQO2 on TNF-induced JNK activation, one of the earliest events induced by TNF (18), we stimulated
cells with TNF for various time intervals, prepared whole-cell
extracts, and analyzed them for JNK activity with an immunecomplex kinase assay. TNF induced the maximum activation
(4.3-fold) of JNK at 15 min in NQO2-WT but in NQO2 / cells,
almost no activation was observed (Fig. 3A). These results indicated
that NQO2 is required for TNF-induced JNK activation.
NQO2 is required for TNF-induced activation of Akt. To
examine the specific role of NQO2 on TNF-induced Akt activation,
another early event induced by TNF (23), we exposed cells with
TNF for indicated time intervals, prepared whole-cell extracts, and
assayed them for phosphorylation of Akt by Western blot analysis.
TNF induced activation of Akt in NQO2-WT but not in NQO2 /
cells (Fig. 3B). These results indicated that NQO2 is needed for
TNF-induced Akt activation.
NQO2 is required for TNF-induced activation of p38. The
activation of p38 has been associated with TNF-induced InB
phosphorylation and NF-nB activation (24). TNF induced activation of p38 in NQO2-WT (f2-fold) but in NQO2 / cells, it
remained same as to the control (Fig. 3C). These results indicated
that NQO2 is needed for TNF-induced p38 activation.
NQO2 is required for TNF-induced activation of p44/p42
MAPK. TNF has been reported to activate p44/p42 MAPK through
the Ras/Raf/MAPK kinase cascade (18). TNF induced the timedependent phosphorylation of p44/p42 MAPK in NQO2-WT
but p44/p42 MAPK activation was abolished in NQO2 / cells
(Fig. 3D). These results suggested that NQO2 is also needed for
TNF-induced p44/p42 MAPK activation.
TNF increases NQO2 enzyme activity in wild-type keratinocytes and HepG2 cells. Our results thus far suggest that NQO2
plays a major role in TNF signaling. Next, we determined whether
TNF activates NQO2 activity. NQO2 enzyme activity was measured
in NQO2-WT keratinocytes (Fig. 4A, left). Treatment of these
cells with TNF resulted in a time-dependent increase in the NQO2
enzyme activity. Whether TNF activates NQO2 in cells other than
keratinocytes was also examined. We found that TNF also caused a
time-dependent induction of NQO2 activity in human hepatoblastoma HepG2 cells (Fig. 4A, right).
Abrogation of NQO2 expression by siRNA inhibits TNFinduced NF-nB activation. All studies of the role of NQO2 in TNF
signaling up to this point used genetically deleted NQO2 cells.
Whether the suppression of NQO2 expression by siRNA would also
abrogate TNF signaling was investigated next. NQO2 siRNA was
used to knock down NQO2 protein expression in human
hepatoblastoma HepG2 cells. NQO2 expression was effectively
abolished in the cells treated with NQO2 siRNA but not in those
treated with the scrambled siRNA, as observed by Western blot
analysis (Fig. 4B). TNF failed to induce the NQO2 activity in cells
transfected with NQO2 siRNA (Fig. 4C), and this correlated with
inhibition of TNF-induced NF-nB activation (Fig. 4D). Thus, these

The Role of NQO2 in TNF-Induced Signaling Pathway

results with NQO2 siRNA also show the critical role of NQO2 in
TNF signaling.
NQO2 is required for expression of TNF-induced, NF-KB–
dependent MMP-9, cyclin D1, and COX-2 proteins. Given that
TNF induces cyclin D1, COX-2, and MMP-9 (25–27) expression, we
examined whether NQO2 is needed for the induction of these
gene products. Cells were treated with TNF for different intervals,
whole-cell extracts were prepared, and the extracts analyzed by
Western blot analysis for the expression of MMP-9, cyclin D1, and
COX-2 (Fig. 5A). All these were induced by TNF in a timedependent manner in NQO2-WT but not in NQO2 / cells.
NQO2 is required for expression of TNF-induced NF-KB–
dependent antiapoptotic proteins. Because NF-nB also regulates the expression of various antiapoptotic proteins, including

IAP1/2, Bcl-2, XIAP, and cFLIP (28–30), we investigated the effect
of NQO2 on the TNF-induced expression of these antiapoptotic gene products. TNF induced the expression of IAP1/2, Bcl-2,
XIAP, and cFLIP in a time-dependent manner in NQO2-WT
but not in NQO2 / cells (Fig. 5B). These results indicated that
NQO2 is required for TNF-induced NF-nB–regulated survival gene
products.
Deletion of NQO2 potentiates TNF-induced apoptosis.
Activation of NF-nB has been shown to inhibit TNF-induced
apoptosis and promote proliferation through the expression of the
previously mentioned gene products (31–33). Our results suggest
that deletion of NQO2 might enhance apoptosis induced by TNF
through suppression of NF-nB–regulated antiapoptotic gene
products. Whether suppression of NF-nB by NQO2 deletion affects

of NQO2 in TNF signaling. The model suggests the role of NQO2 in TNF-induced activation of NF-nB, JNK, p38, p42/p44 MAPK, Akt, and apoptosis.

enhanced that cytotoxicity (Fig. 6A).
The results of Annexin V staining to determine whether this
suppressed cell proliferation was due to apoptosis showed that
TNF-induced apoptosis in 9% of NQO2-WT cells and 88% of
NQO2 / cells (Fig. 6B). The PARP cleavage assay showed that
NQO2 deletion potentiated TNF-induced caspase activity (Fig. 6C).
All these assay results suggested that NQO2 deletion potentiates
TNF-induced apoptosis.

Discussion
This study was designed to investigate the role of NQO2 on TNFinduced cell signaling. We found that TNF induced NF-nB
activation, IKK activation, InBa degradation, p65 phosphorylation,
and p65 translocation in NQO2 -WT but not in NQO2 /
keratinocytes. Further, the activation of TNF-induced JNK, p38
MAPK, p44/p42 MAPK, and Akt was also abrogated in NQO2 /
cells. TNF induced the expression of NF-nB–dependent gene
products cyclin D1, COX-2, MMP-9, IAP1, IAP2, Bcl-2, XIAP, and
cFLIP in NQO2-WT cells, but all were down-regulated in NQO2 /
cells, and this correlated with the inhibition of cell proliferation
and the potentiation of apoptosis induced by TNF (Fig. 6D).
Our results are the first to show that deletion of the NQO2 gene
abolished TNF-induced NF-nB activation. Iskander et al. (34) found
that lipopolysaccharide-induced NF-nB activation was suppressed
in NQO2 / mice compared with wild-type mice and indicated
that the suppression was caused by the loss of NF-nB expression
(34). However, we found that NQO2 / clearly suppressed TNFinduced NF-nB activation compared with NQO2-WT cells without
the loss of NF-nB expression, suggesting that NQO2 is involved
in TNF-induced cell signaling. We also found that TNF activated
NQO2 activity in different cell types. NQO2-specific siRNA
abolished the expression of NQO2 protein and abrogated TNFinduced NQO2 activity and NF-nB activation.
Although how NQO2 plays a role in TNF-induced NF-nB
activation is not clear, the alteration of the redox status of the
cell by NQO2 presumably regulates activation of redox-sensitive
transcription factor(s), such as NF-nB (35). This is in agreement
with earlier observations from our laboratory that overexpression of the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase (36) and
g-glutamyl cysteine synthetase (37) can abolish TNF-induced cell
signaling, including NF-nB activation. Thus, our results suggest
that the deletion of NQO2 leads to altered intracellular redox status
that results in the suppression of NF-nB activation. Intriguingly,
deletion of the NQO1 gene leads to a similar phenotype, suggesting
a nonredundant role for NQO1 and NQO2 in TNF-induced
activation of NF-nB (17).
Our results indicate that deletion of NQO2 abolished TNF-induced
InBa degradation and phosphorylation through inhibition of IKK
activation. How the deletion of NQO2 leads to suppression of IKK
activation, however, is unclear, partly because the kinase that
activates IKK is unknown. NIK, MEKK1, MEKK3, Akt, transforming
growth factor-h–activated kinase 1, glycogen synthase kinase 3h
(GSK-3h), NQO1, MKK4, and PKR have been shown to be involved in
the IKK activation induced by TNF (17, 38–42). Sarbassov et al. (43)
recently reported that rictor kinase phosphorylates Akt, which in
turn can activate IKK, leading to InBa phosphorylation and NF-nB
activation. We found that TNF-induced Akt activation was indeed
abrogated by deletion of the NQO2 gene.

Resveratrol, an active constituent found in cranberry, red grapes,
and nuts, has been shown to modulate NQO2 activity in two
different ways. First, resveratrol suppresses melanoma cell
proliferation through the induction of NQO2 protein and activity
(44). Second, resveratrol is also a potent inhibitor of NQO2 activity
in vitro with a dissociation constant of 35 nmol/L (45, 46). Our
group has already shown that resveratrol suppresses TNF-induced
activation of NF-nB and AP-1 through down-modulation of reactive
oxygen intermediate generation and lipid peroxidation (47). Here,
we also found that besides NF-nB activation, TNF-induced JNK
activation was also abolished in NQO2 / cells. These results are in
agreement with Manna et al. (47), who showed that resveratrol, a
specific NQO2 inhibitor, significantly suppressed TNF-induced
AP-1 activation because JNK activation causes the activation AP-1.
Moreover, we established for the first time that NQO2 / also
abolishes TNF-induced activation of Akt, p38, and p44/p42 MAPK.
These results parallel those of our previous reports, in which we
showed that NQO2 / and GSK-3h abolished TNF-induced
activation of Akt and MAPK factors (17, 41). Although the role of
these genes differ from each other in response to stimuli, it is
possible that these genes have similar TNF-induced responses.
Our results also show for the first time that the expression of
various NF-nB–dependent gene products, including COX-2, cyclin
D1, MMP-9, IAP1, IAP2, Bcl-2, XIAP, and cFLIP is abolished in
NQO2 / cells. The down-regulation of these gene products
suggests that deletion of NQO2 suppresses TNF-induced proliferation and enhances apoptosis. Indeed, we found that in NQO2 /
cells, TNF-induced cell proliferation was inhibited and apoptosis
increased significantly. Other studies indicate that the deletion of
NQO2 increases sensitivity to skin carcinogenesis and suppresses
apoptosis of bone marrow cells (6, 7, 34). NF-nB activation, however,
has been linked with suppression of apoptosis, cellular proliferation,
invasion, angiogenesis, and metastasis (30). Thus, suppression of
NF-nB activation by deletion of NQO2 seems to be paradoxical.
However, most agents mediate opposite pathways, depending on
other factors such as cell type. For instance, although TNF induces
apoptosis in some cells, it induces the proliferation of others (18).
Recently, it has been reported that NQO2 activity of ovarian
tissues is higher than in bladder samples, indicating that a potential
role of the gene in the treatment of tumor (48). Although various
pro-oxidants can modulate both NF-nB and NQO2 activity, it is less
clear whether the expression of NQO2 requires NF-nB activation.
However, given that TNF and NF-nB are involved in the several
disease states, including cancer, inflammation, diabetes, and
neurodegenerative disorders (30, 49), the potential of suppressing
the TNF cell-signaling pathway by using NQO2 inhibitors exists (47).
Thus, our results show that NQO2 can regulate TNF-induced
apoptosis through the NF-nB–regulated gene products, indicating
that NQO2 plays a pivotal role in TNF-induced signaling pathway
and that its suppression is a potential therapeutic approach in
tumor cells.
