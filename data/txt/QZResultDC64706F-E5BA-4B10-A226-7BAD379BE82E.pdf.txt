Abstract
5-Fluorouracil (5FU) and oxaliplatin are standard therapy for
metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC), but the development of
chemoresistance is inevitable. Because cancer stem cells (CSC)
are hypothesized to be chemoresistant, we investigated CSC
properties in newly developed chemoresistant CRC cell lines
and sought to identify targets for therapy. The human CRC cell
line HT29 was exposed to increasing doses of 5FU (HT29/5FUR) or oxaliplatin (HT29/OxR) to achieve resistance at clinically
relevant doses. Western blotting and flow cytometry were
done to determine molecular alterations. The insulin-like
growth factor-I receptor (IGF-IR) monoclonal antibody (mAb)
AVE-1642 was used to inhibit signaling in vitro and in vivo
using murine xenograft models. HT29/5FU-R and HT29/OxR
showed 16- to 30-fold enrichment of CD133+ cells and 2-fold
enrichment of CD44+ cells (putative CRC CSC markers).
Resistant cells were enriched 5- to 22-fold for double-positive
(CD133+/CD44+) cells. Consistent with the CSC phenotype,
resistant cells exhibited a decrease in cellular proliferation
in vitro (47–59%; P < 0.05). Phosphorylated and total IGF-IR
levels were increased in resistant cell lines. HT29/5FU-R and
HT29/OxR cells were f5-fold more responsive to IGF-IR
inhibition relative to parental cells (P < 0.01) in vitro. Tumors
derived from HT29/OxR cells showed significantly greater
growth inhibition in response to an IGF-IR mAb than did
parental cells (P < 0.05). Chemoresistant CRC cells are
enriched for CSC markers and the CSC phenotype. Chemotherapy-induced IGF-IR activation provided for enhanced
sensitivity to IGF-IR–targeted therapy. Identification of CSC
targets presents a novel therapeutic approach in this disease.

Introduction
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer
death in the United States with about 50,000 deaths estimated for
2008 alone (1). Almost 25% of patients who present with CRC present
with metastatic disease, and thousands of patients receive treatment
for metastatic CRC each year (2). Significant improvements in
patient survival rates have been achieved in recent years, largely due
to the availability of targeted molecular therapies in addition to the

standard chemotherapeutic regimens. The median overall survival
duration for patients with metastatic CRC is currently about
20 months; however, most patients still die of their disease (3).
Although the response rate to current systemic therapies is f50%,
resistance develops in nearly all patients. Therefore, it is essential to
understand mechanisms of resistance as a first step in developing
approaches to preventing or reversing chemoresistance in patients
who receive systemic therapy for metastatic CRC.
5-Fluorouracil (5FU) and oxaliplatin are the mainstays of
chemotherapeutic regimens for metastatic CRC. 5FU inhibits
activity of the enzyme thymidylate synthase during DNA replication (4). In contrast, oxaliplatin covalently binds DNA, forming
platinum-DNA adducts that cause prolonged G2 arrest and
inhibition of growth, which leads to apoptotic cell death (5).
Although resistance mechanisms have been extensively studied for
both of these agents, therapies to target resistance pathways have
yet to be identified. There is an emerging body of evidence that
tumor cells that are resistant to chemotherapy represent a
subpopulation of cells from the original tumor that are molecularly
and phenotypically distinct. These cells are referred to by several
names, including tumor-initiating cells, tumor-promoting cells, or,
more commonly, cancer stem cells (CSC; ref. 6).
Experimental evidence for the existence of CSCs in CRC was
recently shown using human surgical specimens (7–9). Cells
characterized by the expression or the absence of the transmembrane surface marker CD133 were isolated from fresh CRC tumors
and injected into nonobese diabetic-severe combined immunodeficient mice. Tumors resulting from CD133+ cells resembled the
primary tumor from which they were derived and were more
tumorigenic than were CD133 cells. Several other markers have
been identified as putative CSC markers, including CD44, epithelial
surface antigen, and CD166 (9). There is no consensus as to the
exact criteria that define a CSC, as markers may vary according to
tumor type. However, several functional studies have identified
characteristics of these cells, including inherent chemoresistance,
the ability to efflux Hoechst dye, the tendency to form spherical
colonies in vitro, and the ability, in limited numbers, to form
tumors in immunodeficient mice [reviewed in Tang and colleagues
(10)]. Several other properties have been identified in organspecific CSCs, and new studies are continuously being reported
further characterizing the CSC phenotype.
Perhaps the most clinically relevant variable of CSCs is their
resistance to standard chemotherapeutic agents, and thus, there is
a great deal of interest in attempting to identify new targets for
specifically eradicating these cells. Recent attention has been given
to notch signaling (11), the sonic hedgehog pathway (12, 13), and
growth factor receptors.
Given the clinical significance of chemoresistance and the
ineffectiveness of chemotherapy in eliminating CSCs, we chose

to evaluate the relationship between chemoresistance and the CSC
phenotype. We developed two chemoresistant cell lines from a
chemosensitive parental human CRC cell line and investigated
their molecular and phenotypic alterations in vitro and in vivo.
After we detected activation of the insulin-like growth factor-I
receptor (IGF-IR) pathway in the chemoresistant cell lines, we
targeted this pathway in several xenograft studies.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines and culture conditions. The human CRC cell line HT29 was
obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. The oxaliplatinresistant cell line HT29/OxR was developed in our laboratory as previously
described (14). Cells stably resistant to 5FU were developed by exposing
parental HT29 cells to an initial dose of 0.1 Ag/mL and culturing surviving
cells to a confluence of 80% for three passages (f6 wk). The cells that
survived initial 5FU treatment were then exposed to 0.5 Ag/mL 5FU for
three passages (f8 wk) and then 1.0 Ag/mL for three passages (f8 wk).
Finally, the 5FU concentration was increased to the clinically relevant
plasma concentration of 2 Ag/mL for 3 wk (10 wk). The surviving resistant
cells were named HT29/5FU-R.
All cells were cultured in MEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum (FBS), vitamins, nonessential amino acids, penicillin-streptomycin,
sodium pyruvate, and L-glutamine (Life Technologies). Oxaliplatin- and
5FU-resistant cells were continuously cultured in 2 Amol/L and 2 Ag/mL of
the respective drugs, unless otherwise indicated. In vitro experiments were
carried out at 70% cell confluence and confirmed in at least three
independent experiments.
Drugs and antibodies. Oxaliplatin and 5FU were purchased from the
M. D. Anderson Cancer Center pharmacy. The monoclonal antibody (mAb)
AVE-1642 (provided by Sanofi-Aventis) was used to inhibit IGF-IR signaling
in vitro and in vivo and has been previously described (15). Antibodies used
for flow cytometry, immunohistochemical analysis, immunofluorescence, or
Western blotting were as follows: rabbit anti-CD133, rabbit anti-phosphorylated IGF-IR (Cell Signaling Technology), mouse anti-vinculin, rabbit
anti-h-actin (Sigma-Aldrich), mouse anti-CD44 (Abcam), phycoerythrin
(PE)-conjugated anti-CD133, PE-conjugated mouse-IgG1 (Miltenyi Biotec),

FITC-conjugated anti-CD44, FITC-conjugated mouse-IgG2b, rabbit antiIGF-IR (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and mouse anti-Ki67 (Dako).
Western blotting. For all Western blot analyses, protein was harvested
from cells plated to 70% to 80% confluence. Whole-cell lysates were isolated
using radioimmunoprecipitation assay B protein lysis buffer as previously
described (16). Secreted proteins were obtained from conditioned medium
after cells were plated in 1% FBS medium for 48 h; medium was harvested
and concentrated using Amicon Ultra Centrifugal Filter Devices (Millipore
Corp.). Quantification of these proteins was completed using a modified
Bradford assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories). Protein samples for Western blotting
were prepared by boiling after the addition of denaturing sample buffer.
Proteins were separated using SDS-PAGE on an 8% or 15% gel and
transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore) by electroblotting. Antibodies were diluted in TBS and 0.1% (v/v) Tween with 5%
nonfat dry milk after 1 h of protein blocking in the absence of antibody.
Membranes were incubated at 4jC overnight with primary antibody.
Membranes were subsequently washed and incubated with the appropriate
horseradish peroxidase–conjugated secondary antibody (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h at room temperature. Membranes were again washed, and
protein bands were visualized using a commercially available enhanced
chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Biosciences). When appropriate,
membranes were incubated in stripping solution for 30 min at 65jC,
washed, and reprobed with a second primary antibody for verification of
loading control.
Flow cytometry and cell cycle analysis. Cells were prepared for
analysis of cell surface marker expression by plating to 70% confluence the
day before analysis. Cells were then detached from plates by incubation
with enzyme-free cell dissociation buffer (Invitrogen). Cells were washed in
PBS and resuspended in 1% bovine serum albumin plus fluorophoreconjugated primary antibodies for 30 min at room temperature. Samples
were then washed and analyzed using a Cell Lab Quanta flow cytometer
coupled to a computer with data acquisition and analysis software
(Beckman Coulter).
Proliferation and chemosensitivity assay. Rates of proliferation and
sensitivity to drugs were assessed using the colorimetric 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay as described
previously (17). Briefly, 2,500 cells of each cell line were plated per well in
96-well plates in 200 AL medium with or without drug (5FU, oxaliplatin, and

Western blotting showed that expression of
the CRC stem cell markers CD133 and
CD44 was higher in the chemoresistant cell
lines HT29/5FU-R and HT29/OxR than in
the parental HT29 human CRC cell line.
Vinculin and h-actin levels are provided as
loading controls. B, flow cytometric
analysis showed that both chemoresistant
cell lines were enriched for cells that
expressed CD133 and CD44 when
compared with the parental cell line.
Thirty-six percent of HT29/5FU-R cells
and 57% of HT29/OxR cells expressed
CD133 relative to 2% of HT29 cells.
Similarly, 95% of chemoresistant cells
expressed CD44 relative to only 43% of
parental cells. Cytometric analysis plots
using isotype control antibodies are
provided as staining controls. C, when cells
were labeled with both markers, flow
cytometric analysis showed f5-fold
enrichment of double-positive cells in the
HT29/5FU-R cell line and f22-fold
enrichment in the oxaliplatin-resistant cell
line compared with the parental HT29
cell line. SCC, side scatter.

Chemoresistant CRC Cells and IGF-IR Inhibition

Figure 2. Chemoresistant cell lines are
enriched for tumor stem cell phenotype. A,
chemoresistant cells proliferate at a
significantly slower rate than do parental
cells by MTT analysis. OD, absorbance.
B, parental cells show sensitivity to both
5FU and oxaliplatin (Ox ) after exposure to
drug for 72 h, with only 40% and 58% of
cells remaining, respectively, relative to
untreated cells. In contrast, HT29/5FU-R
cells are resistant to 5FU as expected;
however, they also show an increase in
resistance to oxaliplatin relative to parental
cells. Similarly, oxaliplatin-resistant cells
are resistant to oxaliplatin but also are
resistant to 5FU. C, cells were plated in an
ultralow-attachment 96-well plate in the
absence of serum, and 14 d later, the
number of viable sphere-forming cells was
assayed by MTT. Chemoresistant cells
showed a 2- to 3-fold increase in
colonosphere-forming cells relative to
parental cells. D, in a soft agar assay,
5FU- and oxaliplatin-resistant cells formed
significantly more colonies larger than
50 Am in diameter under anchorageindependent growth conditions when
compared with HT29 cells. These findings
are consistent with the described CSC
phenotype. Bars, SE. *, P < 0.05. HPF,

AVE-1642). At each time point (0, 24, 48, and 72 h), 40 AL MTT solution was
added to each well and the plate was incubated for 1 h at 37jC. Medium
was then aspirated from each well, and 100 AL DMSO was added.
Colorimetric analysis was performed at a wavelength of 570 nm using a
standard microplate reader. Doubling times were calculated by plotting
growth curves on Excel v2003.SP2 software (Microsoft Corp.) and using the
built-in exponential regression algorithm.
Colonosphere assay. The ability of cell lines to form spheres in
suspension was evaluated as described by Liu and colleagues (13), with
modifications. DMEM with B27 supplement (Life Technologies), 20 Ag/mL
epidermal growth factor (Invitrogen), 20 Ag/mL fibroblast growth factor
(Invitrogen), and penicillin-streptomycin served as the stem cell medium
(SCM) for these experiments. An equal number of cells from parental
HT29 cells and each chemoresistant cell line were plated at a
concentration of 200 cells/100 AL SCM in each of 32 wells of a 96-well
ultralow-attachment plate (Corning Life Sciences). Cells were supplemented with 100 AL SCM after 5 d of incubation and analyzed on day 10,
when the formation of colonospheres was evaluated by light microscopy.
To quantitate the difference in numbers of spheres between cell lines,
MTT solution (40 AL) was added to each well, and colorimetric
assessment was conducted as above. The average absorbance measurements for each cell line from 32 wells were used as an index of sphere
number.
Anchorage-independent growth assay. Soft agar assays were used to
determine the ability of parental and chemoresistant cell lines to grow

under anchorage-independent conditions. Each well of a six-well plate was
coated with 1 mL of 10% FBS medium with 1% agarose. After 20 min of
incubation at 37jC, cell suspensions of an equal number (500) of parental
and chemoresistant cells were added in 1 mL of medium with 0.5% agarose.
Cells were incubated for 14 d under standard conditions (37jC, 5% CO2)
and with the addition of 300 AL of medium every 3 d to hydrate the exposed
agarose. At the end of the incubation period, wells were examined under a
light microscope at 20 magnification and the number of colonies larger
than 50 Am was counted per well.
S.c. xenograft model and IGF-IR inhibition. Male athymic nude mice,
6 to 8 wk old, were obtained from the National Cancer Institute-Frederick
Cancer Research Facility (Frederick, MD) and acclimated for 2 wk. All
animal studies were conducted under approved guidelines of the Animal
Care and Use Committee of M. D. Anderson Cancer Center. Equal numbers
of cells (106) from parental and chemoresistant cell lines were suspended in
100 AL PBS and injected s.c. into the right rear flank of each mouse (20 mice
per group). When tumors reached f100 mm3, i.p. treatment with
1 mg/mouse AVE-1642 was initiated at a dosing frequency of twice per
week for 10 mice in each group. Tumor growth was observed and recorded
over 10 wk. When tumors in the control group exceeded 1.5 cm in longest
diameter, mice were killed by CO2 asphyxiation according to protocol, and
tumors were excised. Tumors were weighed and measured, and a portion of
each was placed in 10% formalin ( for paraffin embedding), placed in OCT
compound, and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. Tumor volume was
calculated as (length)/2  (width)2.

Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescent analysis. Tumors
preserved in formalin were placed in paraffin blocks and sectioned onto
positively charged microscope slides. They were deparaffinized in xylene,
hydrated in graded alcohol, and pretreated for antigen retrieval in citrate
buffer for 20 min in a 98jC steamer. Tumor sections embedded in OCT
compound were sectioned onto positively charged microscope slides and
serially immersed in acetone, acetone/chloroform mixture (1:1), and then
acetone. Slides were then stained for H&E to assess morphology or antiKi67 antibodies to visualize proliferative nuclei. All immunohistochemical
sections were counterstained with Gill No. 3 hematoxylin (Sigma-Aldrich).
The DeadEnd Fluorometric TUNEL System (Promega) was used to identify
and quantitate apoptotic cells in in vivo sections. Immunofluorescent slides
were examined using a Nikon Microphot FXA fluorescent microscope, and
representative images were obtained. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase–mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) images were processed
using NIH ImageJ v1.34 software, converting TUNEL fluorescent images to
binary images to quantitate staining. Immunohistochemical staining and
fluorescence were quantitated using commercially available image analysis
software (Photoshop v7.0, Adobe Systems, Inc.).

cells resistant to 5FU or oxaliplatin (HT29/5FU-R or HT29/OxR,
respectively) were evaluated by Western blot and flow cytometric
analyses. HT29/5FU-R and HT29/OxR cells expressed significantly
more CD133 and CD44, putative CSC markers (7, 8), than did
parental HT29 cells (Fig. 1A). The number of cells that expressed
CD133 and CD44 was also significantly greater in the chemoresistant cell lines than in parental cells (Fig. 1B). Whereas only 2%
of parental cells expressed CD133 and 43% expressed CD44, more
than 36% of HT29/5FU-R and 57% of HT29/OxR cells expressed
CD133, and 95% of both types of chemoresistant cells expressed
CD44. In fact, 5FU-resistant cells were f5-fold and oxaliplatinresistant cells f22-fold enriched for cells positive for both CD133
and CD44 (Fig. 1C).
Effect of chemoresistance on the cellular phenotype. In vitro
proliferation was assessed by plating equal numbers of cells of each
cell line and by using MTT assay as an index of cell number. The
proliferation rates of both 5FU- and oxaliplatin-resistant cells were
significantly lower than that of the parental cells (P < 0.05; Fig. 2A).
Specifically, the doubling time of parental HT29 cells was 17 hours,
whereas the doubling times of HT29/5FU-R and HT29/OxR cells
were 32 and 42 hours (P < 0.05 versus parental cells), respectively.
MTT assay was also used to evaluate sensitivity to chemotherapeutic agents. Parental and 5FU- and oxaliplatin-resistant cells
were exposed to clinically relevant doses of 5FU and oxaliplatin,
and the remaining number of cells was evaluated after 48 hours.
Parental cells were sensitive to both oxaliplatin and 5FU, with only
40% and 58% of viable cells remaining after exposure to drug,
respectively (Fig. 2B). 5FU-resistant cells were resistant to 5FU as
expected, but these cells were also resistant to oxaliplatin, with 80%
of viable cells remaining after 72 hours of exposure. Similarly,
oxaliplatin-resistant cells were resistant to oxaliplatin as expected
but also showed cross-resistance to 5FU.
CSCs have the described ability to form colonies, or spheres, in
the absence of serum and without attachment to culture plates
(13). We evaluated the ability of parental and chemoresistant cell
lines to grow colon cancer cell spheres, or colonospheres, under
serum-free conditions. Differences between cell lines were
quantitated by plating a limited number of cells in each well of a
low-attachment 96-well plate and evaluating the ability of cells to
form colonospheres. HT29/5FU-R and HT29/OxR cells had an
increased number of spheres relative to parental cells (P < 0.05;
Fig. 2C). Chemoresistant cells also showed an increased ability to
form colonies under anchorage-independent conditions in a
standard soft agar assay after 14 days in culture (Fig. 2D).
Effect of chemoresistance on IGF-IR signaling. Constitutive
signaling in parental and chemoresistant cell lines, with a focus on
targets for which agents that inhibit target function are readily
available, was evaluated by Western blotting. We studied the
activation status of several growth factor receptors but focused our
efforts on IGF-IR, for which we observed the most marked
alterations. Levels of phosphorylated IGF-IR were higher in both
HT29/5FU-R and HT29/OxR cells than in parental cells (Fig. 3A).
Levels of total IGF-IR were also increased in the chemoresistant
cell lines.
The IGF-IR mAb AVE-1642 was used to determine the
dependence of the cells on IGF-IR signaling for survival. MTT
assay showed that AVE-1642 treatment of chemoresistant cells led
to only a minor decrease (13%) in cell number in the parental cells
but a significantly greater reduction in cell number in the
chemoresistant cells relative to the parental cells (48% for HT29/
5FU-R and 54% for HT29/OxR; P < 0.05 in each case; Fig. 3B).

Chemoresistant CRC Cells and IGF-IR Inhibition

1  106 HT29 or HT29/5FU-R cells in one
experiment or HT29 or HT29/OxR cells in
a second experiment and treated with
control IgG or AVE1642 twice weekly. The
final tumor masses were measured and
compared between mice bearing tumors
from each cell line. Relative to controltreated mice, HT29/5FU-R–derived (A) and
HT29/OxR-derived tumors (B) showed
significantly greater growth inhibition than
did HT29-derived tumors. TUNEL staining
revealed significantly greater apoptosis in
response to AVE1642 in tumors derived
from HT29/5FU-R–derived (C) and HT29/
OxR-derived tumors (D ) than in tumors
derived from parental cells. Bars, SE.
*, P < 0.05.

We further evaluated whether treatment with AVE-1642 would
restore chemosensitivity in our chemoresistant cell lines. Using the
MTT assay, there were no differences between cells treated with
AVE-1642 and those treated with both AVE-1642 and either 5FU or
oxaliplatin after 48 hours of exposure (data not shown). This
chemosensitivity assay was performed with both HT29/5FU-R and
HT29/OxR cells, yielding similar results.
Effect of IGF-IR inhibition on in vivo tumor growth. Parental
and chemoresistant cells were injected s.c. in the right flanks of nude
mice, and tumor growth was assessed during biweekly treatment
with AVE-1642 or with nonspecific, isotype-matched control mAb.
After f4 weeks (at which time maximum tumor size approached
1.5 cm3), tumors were harvested and analyzed. Tumors derived
from parental and chemoresistant cells that were treated with
AVE1642 were significantly smaller than those treated with control
antibody (Fig. 4A and B). However, HT29/5FU-R tumors and HT29/
OxR tumors showed significantly greater tumor growth inhibition
with AVE-1642 treatment than did parental cells. 5FU-resistant
cells showed 48% growth inhibition and oxaliplatin-resistant cells
65% growth inhibition relative to parental cells (17%; P < 0.05).
Evaluation of a proliferative marker (Ki67) by staining of tumor
sections showed that the mAb to IGF-IR led to a decrease in the
number of proliferating cells in all tumors compared with those
treated with control antibody. However, similar to tumor growth
inhibition, blockade of IGF-IR led to a greater effect in chemoresistant tumors than in tumors from parental cells, although this
difference did not reach statistical significance. TUNEL staining
was used to evaluate apoptosis in xenografts. Quantification of
TUNEL staining showed that AVE-1642 treatment caused significantly more apoptosis in tumors derived from HT29/5FU-R and
HT29/OxR cells than in tumors derived from HT29 cells (P < 0.05;
Fig. 4C and D). Specifically, HT29 tumors showed a 2.7-fold
increase in apoptotic nuclei with IGF-IR inhibition compared with
a 5.3-fold increase in HT29/5FU-R–derived and a 5.5-fold increase
in HT29/OxR-derived tumors (P < 0.05 in each case). Representative images from all tumor sections analyzed, in addition to
photographs of s.c. tumors, can be seen in Fig. 5.

Discussion
CRC is the second leading cause of cancer death in the United
States. Despite recent therapeutic regimens that have significantly
increased survival in metastatic disease, invariably, nearly all
tumors become chemoresistant. Understanding the mechanisms of
resistance in CRC is essential to optimizing current therapeutic
strategies.
To address the issue of identifying potential targets in chemoresistant cell lines, we created two chemoresistant cell lines from
the parental human CRC cell line HT29. HT29/5FU-R and HT29/
OxR cells were developed to be resistant to 5FU and oxaliplatin,
respectively, at the clinically relevant plasma concentrations of
patients receiving these drugs. The oxaliplatin-resistant cell line
was characterized in a previous study from our laboratory whereby
oxaliplatin-resistant cells were shown to undergo epithelial-tomesenchymal transition (EMT; ref. 14). EMT-consistent changes
were likewise observed in the HT29/5FU-resistant cell line (data
not shown). In attempting to determine the mechanisms that
imparted chemoresistance on our cell lines, we investigated these
cells for CRC stem cell markers because CSCs are characterized by
being chemoresistant.
Many investigators have used fluorescence-activated cell sorting
to identify and isolate CSCs and determined that these cells are
chemoresistant. We took the opposite approach by developing
chemoresistant cells and then determining whether these cells
acquired CSC characteristics. We determined that both 5FU- and
oxaliplatin-resistant cells were significantly enriched for the CSC
markers CD133 and CD44. Chemoresistant cells were also more
quiescent in vitro, showing a decrease in cellular proliferation
relative to parental cells. However, HT29/5FU-R and HT29/OxR
cells showed an increased ability to form colonies in soft agar
under anchorage-independent conditions and an increased ability
to form spheres in specialized serum-free medium, all properties
consistent with the CSC phenotype (13, 18–20). Oxaliplatinresistant cells showed an increase in resistance to 5FU, and
likewise, 5FU-resistant cells were cross-resistant to oxaliplatin. This
finding suggests that acquired resistance to one chemotherapeutic

was conducted, and multiple tumor fields
were evaluated per group. Representative
images for all groups from both
experiments are presented. H&E staining
revealed similar s.c. tumor morphology
among all groups of tumors. Ki67 staining
showed decreased proliferative cells in
tumors treated with AVE1642; however,
differences in reduction of proliferative
cells between parental and resistant
cell-derived tumor sections were not
significant. TUNEL staining revealed
significantly greater apoptosis in response
to AVE1642 in tumors derived from
chemoresistant cells than in tumors derived
from parental cells (P < 0.05).

agent activates general resistance pathways that impart resistance
to multiple agents. Chemoresistant cells show enrichment of CSC
markers and properties consistent with the CSC phenotype;
however, definitive evidence that these cells are true CSCs has
yet to be obtained, and alternate explanations for our findings do
exist. For example, it is certainly plausible that the process of
developing chemoresistant cell lines may include increased
expression of CSC markers rather than enrich for those cells
already expressing these markers. Testing this hypothesis would be
difficult, however, as little is known about the pathways involved
and the expression pattern of CD133 in epithelial malignancies. In
addition, studies in our laboratory have shown that CSC marker
expression is elevated in lysates obtained from cell line–derived
CRC spheres relative to adherent tumor cells (data not shown).
Given this finding and the data presented in this study, we have
shown two mechanisms by which selection of cells using either
sphere formation or chemoresistance enriches for CSC marker–
expressing cells. To definitively explain our findings, further studies
to elucidate the mechanism of resistance and increased marker
expression are needed.
We also investigated the activation status of growth factor
receptors in response to chemoresistance in a focused attempt to
identify potential mediators in the chemoresistant cells that
would allow specific targeting of these cells with available agents.
One such pathway was the IGF-IR signaling pathway, known to
be involved in CRC progression and growth (21, 22). In this study,
constitutive IGF-IR levels were greater in chemoresistant cell
lines relative to parental cell lines, more notably in the
oxaliplatin-resistant line. The increase in IGF-IR phosphorylation
is associated with the increase of total levels of the receptor. The
attribution of the increase in IGF-IR phosphorylation being due
to an increase in total levels of IGF-IR is supported by the fact
that there were no demonstrable changes in expression of the
ligands for IGF-IR (IGF-I and IGF-II; data not shown). The precise
mechanism of the increase in IGF-IR expression in these cells
remains unknown. Inhibition of Src and Akt signaling failed to
block the increase in IGF-IR expression, ruling out these
pathways as the mechanism for IGF-IR induction in chemoresistant cell lines.

Inhibition of IGF-IR in vitro led to a decrease in cell growth as
determined by MTT assay, and these effects were greater in the
chemoresistant cell lines. In vivo, after treatment with AVE-1642,
inhibition of growth of tumors derived from 5FU- and oxaliplatinresistant cells was significantly higher than the growth inhibition
noted in tumors derived from parental cells. Our laboratory
previously showed that IGF-IR inhibition in an orthotopic model of
metastatic colon cancer in the murine liver leads to decreased
tumor growth by induction of tumor cell apoptosis (23). In this
study, we showed that IGF-IR inhibition caused a modest decrease
in the growth of parental tumors (17% inhibition), whereas the
effect on growth of chemoresistant cell-derived tumors was
significantly greater (48% for HT29/5FU-R and 65% for HT29/
OxR; P < 0.05), which was largely due to an increase in apoptosis.
Inhibition of IGF-IR in vitro did not lead to increased sensitivity to
5-FU or oxaliplatin, and thus, in vivo studies using both AVE-1642
and 5FU or oxaliplatin were not performed.
In addition to IGF-IR, we studied several other growth factor
receptors in the chemoresistant cell lines, including epidermal
growth factor receptor, cMET, and RON (data not shown). However,
we focused our studies in IGF-IR because preliminary studies
in vitro using inhibitors of each of the above-mentioned pathways
did not show significant effects on chemoresistant cell proliferation.
5FU and oxaliplatin act by distinct mechanisms to cause tumor
cell cytotoxicity, and it is unlikely that acquired chemoresistance to
these agents would yield common molecular alterations. However,
our data show that when cells are chronically exposed to either
agent, the resulting cells acquire similar molecular alterations that
are characteristic of the CSC phenotype. Interestingly, these
resistant cells expressed increased levels of IGF-IR (and, in turn,
phosphorylated IGF-IR), making these cells more sensitive to
blockade of this pathway. Recent data have suggested that the
targeting of growth factor receptors, such as that encoded by the
MET proto-oncogene, may be an effective method for targeting
chemoresistant CSCs [reviewed in Boccaccio and Comoglio (24)].
Similar to the activity of MET kinase, our data suggest that IGF-IR
inhibition may also target these cells. Our data lead us to further
hypothesize that inhibition of IGF-IR signaling in the chemoresistant setting may be more effective than inhibition of this

pathway in the frontline setting. This hypothesis requires further
study in preclinical and clinical trials. IGF-IR inhibition may prove
to be the therapeutic strategy that is effective in patients with
otherwise untreatable disease.
