Intratumoral Modeling of Geﬁtinib Pharmacokinetics and
Pharmacodynamics in an Orthotopic Mouse Model of
Glioblastoma
Jyoti Sharma1,2, Hua Lv2, and James M. Gallo2

Abstract
Like many solid tumors, glioblastomas are characterized by intratumoral biologic heterogeneity that may
contribute to a variable distribution of drugs and their associated pharmacodynamic responses, such that the
standard pharmacokinetic approaches based on analysis of whole-tumor homogenates may be inaccurate. To
address this aspect of tumor pharmacology, we analyzed intratumoral pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic
characteristics of the EGFR inhibitor geﬁtinib in mice with intracerebral tumors and developed corresponding
mathematical models. Following a single oral dose of geﬁtinib (50 or 150 mg/kg), tumors were processed at
selected times according to a novel brain tumor sectioning protocol that generated serial samples to measure
geﬁtinib concentrations, phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (pERK), and immunohistochemistry in 4 different regions of tumors. Notably, we observed up to 3-fold variations in intratumoral concentrations
of geﬁtinib, but only up to half this variability in pERK levels. As we observed a similar degree of variation in the
immunohistochemical index termed the microvessel pericyte index (MPI), a measure of permeability in the
blood–brain barrier, we used MPI in a hybrid physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model to account for
regional changes in drug distribution that were observed. Subsequently, the PBPK models were linked to a
pharmacodynamic model that could account for the variability observed in pERK levels. Together, our tumor
sectioning protocol enabled integration of the intratumoral pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic variability of
geﬁtinib and immunohistochemical indices followed by the construction of a predictive PBPK/pharmacodynamic model. These types of models offer a mechanistic basis to understand tumor heterogeneity as it impacts the
activity of anticancer drugs. Cancer Res; 73(16); 5242–52. 2013 AACR.

Introduction
Glioblastoma multiforme, also called grade 4 astrocytoma, is
the most aggressive and frequent of all primary brain tumors,
accounting for about 54% of all gliomas (CBTRUS report 2011),
with a median survival of less than 1 year from diagnosis (1, 2).
Although new combination drug regimens have generated
excitement and positive responses, they ultimately fail as
tumors enact numerous drug-resistant mechanisms. These
failures are often attributed to pharmacodynamics or cellular
mechanisms that have their origins in either preexisting or
adaptive genetic alterations that manifest as biochemical networks unresponsive to the selected drugs. Regional analysis

from glioblastoma multiforme samples has revealed extensive
intratumoral heterogeneity in genetic composition and protein
expression (3), including variable EGFRvIII expression (4) and
EGFR and PDGFR gene ampliﬁcation patterns across the same
tumor sample (5). In such a scenario, reliance on singular bulk
tumor samples to map individual genomic proﬁles and prioritize therapeutic strategies could be inaccurate as a means to
advance personalized medicine.
In addition to pharmacodynamic-based treatment failures,
it is also reasonable to expect that pharmacokinetic-based
failures also contribute to poor drug responses. In this case,
tumor concentrations would be insufﬁcient to inhibit intended
targets that could be accentuated by intratumoral biologic
heterogeneity. Glioblastoma multiforme is a heterogeneous,
highly invasive brain tumor characterized by a highly disorganized vasculature and a compromised blood–brain barrier
(BBB; ref. 6). Intratumoral variability within glioblastoma
multiformes has been observed for morphology and functioning of the vasculature (7, 8), vessel permeability (9), interstitial
ﬂuid pressure (10), necrosis, and cell proliferation and density
(11–14) that may contribute to heterogeneous drug distribution. Much of the limited data in this regard were based on the
use of quantitative autoradiography, a sensitive technique that
is limited by the resources need to synthesize radiolabeled
drugs and their lack of speciﬁcity (10, 15–18). Other attempts to

Intratumoral Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic Modeling

examine regional pharmacokinetic variability have used unlabeled drugs and mass spectrometry for drug concentration
measurements; however, the measurements were sparse preventing a systematic analysis that would support the development of models (19). Of course, it is to be expected that
clinical investigations of brain tumor concentrations are limited by sample availability, yet there is an indication that
intratumoral drug concentrations of various chemotherapeutic drugs (20, 21), and some targeted anticancer agents like
imatinib (22) and geﬁtinib (23) were quite variable. All these
studies lend support to the hypothesis that ineffective chemotherapy could be due to pharmacokinetic-based failures.
Given the rise in the importance of tumor heterogeneity and
the lack of systematic investigations to detail such heterogeneity with respect to both pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, we applied our recently developed tumor sampling
protocol, which assigns adjacent tumor sections to either
pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, or immunohistochemical (IHC) analyses, to characterize the intratumoral pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic variability of geﬁtinib.

Materials and Methods
Materials
U87/EGFRvIII and U87/PTEN cell lines were a generous gift
from Dr. Webster Cavenee (University of California San Diego,
San Diego, CA) and Dr. Paul Mischel (University of California at
Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA), respectively. U87-MG cell line
was purchased from the American Type Culture Collection.
Authentication of cell lines, including the parental cell lines,
was based on Western blot analyses of EGFR, EGFRvIII, and
PTEN. Geﬁtinib and the internal standard vandatinib were
purchased from LC laboratories. All other chemicals and
reagents were obtained from commercial suppliers as listed
in the Supplementary Materials and Methods.
Male NIH Swiss nude mice were supplied by Taconic Co. and
maintained in the Center for Comparative Medicine and
Surgery at Mount Sinai School of Medicine (New York, NY)
that is accredited by the International Association for Assessment & Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care. All animal
studies were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and
Use Committee at Mount Sinai School of Medicine. Male nude
mice at the age of 5 to 7 weeks and weighing 23 to 25 g were
used for all studies.
Cell culture
U87, U87/PTEN, and U87/EGFRvIII cells were cultured in
Dulbecco's Modiﬁed Eagle Medium with 10% FBS and supplemented with penicillin/streptomycin. The cells were maintained in a humidiﬁed incubator at 37 C with 5% CO2.
Orthotopic tumor implantation
The procedure for brain tumor implantation was similar to
that reported previously (24). Brieﬂy, nude mice (Male NIH
Swiss nude mice, nu/nu, 5–7 weeks old) were anesthetized and
secured in a stereotactic apparatus. A suspension of glioma
cells (U87/EGFRvIII) was prepared fresh from culture (105
cells/mL in PBS) and injected (5 mL) into the caudate putamen.
After one week, mice were monitored once a day for symptoms

related to tumor growth that included an arched back,
unsteady gait, and loss of body weight. Mice were entered into
the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic studies when they
showed a total body weight loss of 10% or more on 2 consecutive days.
In vivo geﬁtinib treatment and sampling
Geﬁtinib was administered at a dose of 50 or 150 mg/kg by
oral gavage. A serial sacriﬁce design was used with blood and
tumor samples collected from 3 mice at each scheduled time
point (i.e., 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 18, and 24 hours) following drug
administration. The brain tumors were serially sectioned using
a cryostat to obtain samples for pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and IHC analyses in 4 distinct regions separated
by 1 mm intervals starting from the periphery (region R1) to the
center (region R4) of each tumor as we recently reported (25).
Drug analysis (liquid chromatography/tandem mass
spectrometry)
Previously validated liquid chromatography/tandem mass
spectrometry methods were used to quantitate geﬁtinib in
plasma (26) and brain tumor samples (25).
pERK analysis
A highly sensitive electrochemiluminescence method was
used to analyze phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated
kinase (pERK) in brain tumor sections collected from various
regions of brain tumor, as described previously (25). The assay
was run according to the manufacturer's protocol with the
phospho and total extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)
ratios expressed as a fraction of baseline (untreated tumors)
phospho/total ERK, which was set to 1.
Immunohistochemistry
Cryosections (12 mm) from frozen tumors were allowed to
dry in air for 30 minutes followed by ﬁxation in 4% methanolfree paraformaldehyde at room temperature. The sections
were either triple stained with anti-CD31, anti-SMA, and
terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase–mediated dUTP nick
end labeling (TUNEL; apoptosis) or double stained with antiCD31 and anti-P-glycoprotein using diluted primary and secondary antibodies, followed by nuclear staining with 40 , 6diamidino-2-phenylindole. The detailed staining protocol can
be found in the Supplementary Methods section.
The images of the cryosections were acquired (1.0 mm/pixel)
as grayscale, using an automated ﬂuorescent microscope
(Zeiss Axioplan 2IE, Carl Zeiss Microscopy) controlled by
AxioVision software with subsequent image analyses processed by MetaMorph microscopy automation and image
analysis software (Molecular Devices). The threshold values
of each tumor section image were identiﬁed by positive
staining and then semiquantitated by measuring the number
(for TUNEL/apoptosis staining) or pixel area (for CD31 and
SMA) of positive staining in the region of interest. The number
of total TUNEL-positive cells per total area of each selected
region was presented as the number of apoptotic cells per mm2
of tissue area. Microvessel density (MVD) was calculated as the
total CD31-positive pixel area  100/total pixel area of the

The images were pseudocolored for presentation using

Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic modeling
Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data analyses were
conducted with the SAAMII simulation and modeling program
(version 2, University of Washington, Seattle, WA). The analyses were based on a sequential modeling approach of ﬁrst
deﬁning the pharmacokinetic models and then the pharmacodynamic models. A sequential modeling approach was also
applied to obtain the pharmacokinetic models; speciﬁcally,
hybrid physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models
were derived by ﬁrst ﬁtting the model to the combined geﬁtinib
plasma concentrations from both dose levels to obtain ﬁxed
forcing functions (see Table 1) that were then used to ﬁt the
tumor models to the observed geﬁtinib tumor concentration
data.
On the basis of the signiﬁcant inverse correlation between
geﬁtinib intratumoral concentrations and the MPI, 3 unique
hybrid PBPK models of geﬁtinib were developed corresponding to three MPI groups, indicative of variable BBB permeability. To achieve this goal, the regional pharmacokinetic/
pharmacodynamic data at each dose level were segregated into
three groups according to their corresponding MPI values as
shown in Fig. 1A. The MPI values in each tumor were ranked

from 1 to 4. The tumor pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic
measurements corresponding to regions with a MPI rank ¼ 1
from both dose levels were grouped as the low MPI group,
whereas those corresponding to regions with a MPI rank ¼ 4
formed the high MPI data group. The data from the intermediate MPI ranks (2 and 3) were combined to obtain a medium
MPI group. The PBPK models, consisting of a two-compartment systemic disposition model and a two-compartment
permeability–limited brain tumor model, were individually ﬁt
for each MPI group to geﬁtinib intratumoral concentration
data that produced three different sets of tumor pharmacokinetic parameters. The rate equations for the plasma forcing
function and the tumor compartments are provided in the
Supplementary Materials and Methods.
The following pharmacokinetic parameters were ﬁxed on
the basis of previously reported values; oral absorption rate
constant (Ka), oral bioavailability (26), and for the tumor
pharmacokinetic models, tumor blood ﬂow rate (Qt ¼ 3
mL/h; ref. 27). The mean volume of tumor (Vt) was ﬁxed as
0.001 mL based on its measured value and then assigned as the
volume of tumor vascular compartment (Vv) and extravascular
compartment (Vev) based on a reported volume fraction (28,
29). The geﬁtinib tumor to plasma partition coefﬁcient was
determined as the average of the ratio of observed tumor per
plasma AUC (R) obtained from each dose level. The Michaelis–
Menten constant (Km) for active efﬂux of geﬁtinib by Pgp at the
BBB was estimated by using Bayesian constraints based on
reported values (30). All other parameters were estimated by
ﬁtting the model to the observed geﬁtinib concentrations using
maximum likelihood estimation. These parameters were; central compartment elimination rate constant (k10), volume of
distribution for the central compartment (Vc), intercompartment transfer rate constants (k12 and k21), maximum rate of
active efﬂux from tumor extravascular to vascular compartment (Vmax), tumor vascular to extravascular transcellular
mass transfer coefﬁcient (h), and paracellular transport rate
constant (Kp). Once the hybrid PBPK model was ﬁnalized, the
associated pharmacokinetic variables were set as constant and
linked to the pharmacodynamic model.
The fractional inhibition of pERK in tumors, using untreated
tumors to obtain baseline pERK values, after geﬁtinib administrations was used as the pharmacodynamic response and
represented as a three-compartment sequence of a link compartment connected to a target [i.e., phosphorylated EGFR
(pEGFR) response (i.e., pERK)] model. The link compartment
consisted of an inhibitory Imax model to link geﬁtinib concentrations in tumor (Ct) to the pharmacodynamic model. The
rate equations are provided in the Supplementary Materials
and Methods.
It was assumed that the variability in the pERK response was
solely driven by geﬁtinib tumor concentrations based on their
slightly higher degree of variability that was attributed to
changes in BBB permeability. It was necessary to segregate
the pharmacodynamic models into low- and high-dose groups
to obtain the best-ﬁt models.
The pharmacodynamic model parameters estimated were
the IC50 (geﬁtinib concentrations for 50% inhibition of pEGFR),
Kin (the zero-order formation rate for pEGFR), ktr (the ﬁrst-

one (highlighted in pink) formed the low MPI group, ranks of 2 and 3 formed the medium MPI group, and the rank of 4 (highlighted in blue) formed the high-MPI

pEGFR) and Imax (the maximum inhibitory response of pEGFR)

models were evaluated according to the statistical criteria
generated from SAAMII program, which included the maximum
likelihood objective function, the Akaike information criteria,
and the precision of variables as measured by the coefﬁcient of
variation. In addition, diagnostic plots of model performance
(observed data and residuals vs. model-predicted) are provided
(Supplementary Fig. S6 and S7). Even though differences in
observed and predicted pERK values were at times large, these
differences were random. The residual plots did not show
systematic trends and ruled out model misspeciﬁcation.

doses of 50 and 150 mg/kg of geﬁtinib to mice bearing
intracerebral tumors. Tumor samples collected at the dose of
150 mg/kg geﬁtinib showed an intratumoral variability of
geﬁtinib concentrations in the range of 1.2- to 2.4-fold over
the entire 24-hour time course and about a 1.5-fold difference
in the AUC(0–24 h) between the regions with highest and lowest
geﬁtinib concentrations (Fig. 2A). Parallel to the regional
tumor pharmacokinetics, corresponding pharmacodynamic
(pERK) measurements varied 1.2- to 1.4-fold over 24 hours,
with a similar area between the effect curves (ABEC), a
measure of the cumulative degree of inhibition between the
regions with highest and lowest geﬁtinib concentrations (Fig.
2C). Although intratumoral variability at 150 mg/kg of geﬁtinib was low, geﬁtinib concentrations tended to increase
moving from the tumor peripheral toward the central regions,
which produced an expected opposite trend in pERK values
(Supplementary Fig. S1A and S1B).
Regional variability in intratumoral pharmacokinetics/
pharmacodynamics in mice administered 50 mg/kg of geﬁtinib
was slightly greater than at the higher dose level and over 24
hours, geﬁtinib intratumoral concentrations ranged from 1.6to 3-fold, with a 2-fold difference in the AUC(0–24h) in the regions with highest and lowest geﬁtinib concentrations (Fig. 2B).

was in the range of 1.2- to 1.9-fold with a 1.4-fold difference in
ABEC in the regions with highest and lowest geﬁtinib concentrations (Fig. 2D). Of some interest and opposite to the
high-dose trend, the geﬁtinib concentration gradient decreased in moving from the tumor periphery towards the
central regions (Supplementary Fig. S2A and S2B).
The viability of the tumor sampling protocol was shown by
use of another EGFRvIII brain tumor model, speciﬁcally the
LN229/EGFRvIII-PTEN. Mice bearing these tumors were
administered 150 mg/kg geﬁtinib orally and processed similar
to the U87/EGFRvIII study. This preliminary study focused on
the assessment of intratumoral variability in geﬁtinib concentrations that showed a similar degree of variability as in the
U87EGFRvIII model; ranging from 1.6- to 3.2-fold intratumoral
differences over the 24-hour sampling period (Supplementary
Materials and Methods and Supplementary Table S2).
Intratumoral variability in biologic characteristics
To identify biologic characteristics of the tumor that could
explain the variability in geﬁtinib intratumoral concentrations,
MVD, MPI, and apoptotic cells (MVD, MPI, and apoptotic cells/
mm2) in the tumor regions adjacent to the pharmacokinetic
and pharmacodynamic measurements were analyzed, ﬁrst in
the high-dose 150 mg/kg group. There was a small but significant difference (P < 0.05) in the MVD between the tumor

5246

peripheral and central regions, being lower at the tumor
center (Fig. 3A–C), consistent with a previous report (31). It
seemed counterintuitive that the regions with high MVD
values had lower geﬁtinib concentrations; however, the MPI,
an index of microvessel pericyte coverage and a more accurate
indicator of BBB integrity, showed signiﬁcantly (P < 0.05)
higher values in the tumor peripheral regions compared with
the central regions (Fig. 3D–F), and inversely correlated with
the geﬁtinib concentration gradient. There was no signiﬁcant
difference in the intratumoral apoptotic cells measurements
as a function of tumor region and this was not further
considered as a potential determinant of drug distribution
at the lower 50 mg/kg dose. Therefore, the integrity of the BBB
as measured by the MPI was found to be the most signiﬁcant
determinant of geﬁtinib brain tumor distribution in the highdose group.
The MPI values in the low-dose geﬁtinib group also showed
signiﬁcant (P < 0.05) intratumoral variability. Although, unlike
the high-dose group, the high MPI values were located more
centrally (Supplementary Fig. S3A), but still showed an inverse
correlation to the intratumoral geﬁtinib concentration gradient. Given the concurrence between MPI and intratumoral
geﬁtinib concentrations at both dose levels (Fig. 4), we concluded that BBB integrity was the primary determinant of
regional geﬁtinib tumor concentrations.

expression on microvessels in the tumor center as compared
with the peripheral region. Also the regional MTI measurement
and the corresponding MPI in each of these tumor regions
showed a signiﬁcant positive correlation, reﬂecting that tumor
microvessels with a more intact BBB are associated with a
greater Pgp expression (Supplementary Fig. S3B–S3I) and
could be an additional factor responsible for variability in
geﬁtinib pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics.

of geﬁtinib on the basis of differential BBB permeability
The best-ﬁt PBPK models consisted of a two-compartment
systemic disposition model and a two-compartment permeability–limited model for the tumor (Fig. 1B). The latter twocompartment vascular–extravascular model attested to the
importance of BBB integrity as a key determinant in geﬁtinib
brain tumor distribution. Speciﬁcally, the tumor model incorporated passive transcellular diffusion, active efﬂux, and passive paracellular transport processes. The active efﬂux term
represented Pgp-mediated BBB efﬂux and was based on the
more than dose-proportional increase in geﬁtinib AUC in
tumor (Supplementary Table S1). Transcellular diffusion is a

consistent with the relationship between MPI and BBB integrity, especially at the low dose. This trend was slightly offset at
the high geﬁtinib dose with the medium MPI AUC being
minimally less than the AUC for the high-MPI group. Second,
the difference between the low and high-MPI tumor AUC in
the low-dose group was more (2-fold higher AUC in low MPI
group) than in the high-dose group, where the low and highMPI tumor AUCs were more similar. One likely reason for
this observation is that at the high dose of geﬁtinib, Pgpmediated efﬂux at the BBB is saturated preventing any further
increase in efﬂux at high concentrations. This phenomenon, by
allowing more geﬁtinib to penetrate the BBB, may also have
contributed to the lower intratumoral variability observed at
the 150 mg/kg dose level. Third, Vmax values, indicative of the
maximum Pgp-mediated transport rate, were in the rank order
of high MPI Vmax > medium MPI Vmax > low MPI Vmax that
directly corresponded to the observation of lower Pgp expression found in the regions with low MPI (Supplementary Fig.
S3B–S3I), and consistent with a previous report that found Pgp
expression negatively correlated with immature cerebral
capillaries (33). Finally, the transcellular diffusion coefﬁcient,
h, which is a product of BBB permeability and its surface
area, was found to be almost 5-fold more in the low-MPI
group as compared with the medium MPI group and 8-fold
more as compared with the high-MPI group (low MPI "h" >

bidirectional process driven by concentration gradients across
the BBB. Paracellular transport of geﬁtinib is a unique mechanism that accounted for unidirectional entry of proteinbound geﬁtinib across the disrupted BBB. The best-ﬁt model
supported this was not a bidirectional process. The disrupted
BBB caused by the growth of the tumor created large endothelial cell gaps that are highly permeable to water soluble
compounds and large molecular weight proteins like albumin
(7). The size of the endothelial gaps is much larger than the
steric diameter of albumin and hence could be a signiﬁcant
source of drugs like geﬁtinib that are highly bound to plasma
proteins. In this case, plasma protein-bound geﬁtinib passing
into the tumor interstitium could dissociate and form a
dynamic equilibrium with unbound drug and contribute to
the pool of free drug able to traverse intracellularly and interact
with its receptor or diffuse back into blood. The predicted
plasma and tumor concentration–time proﬁles agreed well
with the observed values in all 3 MPI (low, medium, and high)
data groups (Fig. 5).
Several interesting ﬁndings supported our hypothesis that
variable intratumoral BBB integrity was the primary mechanism for variability in the tumor pharmacokinetics of geﬁtinib
(Table 2). First, the predicted area under the tumor concentration–time curve (AUC) for geﬁtinib adhered to the following
order, low MPI AUC > medium MPI AUC > high MPI AUC,

medium MPI "h" > high MPI "h"), consistent with the low MPI
regions having a more permeable vasculature due to poor
pericyte coverage. The paracellular transport rate term (Kp)
was not signiﬁcantly different between the three MPI groups,
indicating that its contribution is relatively constant across
all MPI groups and that the transcellular transport is the
major contributor to the intratumoral pharmacokinetic
variability.
Once the hybrid PBPK model for each MPI group was
established, the models were linked to pharmacodynamic
models that characterized the pERK proﬁles as shown
in Fig. 1B. A three-compartment sequence of a link compartment connected to a target-response model (26) provided the
best-ﬁt pharmacodynamic model. Given our assumption that
MPI-mediated differences in the PBPK models drove changes
in the pERK response, a separate pharmacodynamic model for
each MPI group was not required. Instead, a pharmacodynamic model was ﬁtted to the combined pERK data from all the

MPI groups, yet segregated by dose (Supplementary Fig. S4 for
each MPI group) generating 2 sets of pharmacodynamic model
parameters (Table 3). This approach attests to the similar
pERK proﬁles for each MPI group. Attempts to ﬁt pharmacodynamic models for each MPI group or for the combined pERK
data for both dose levels resulted in less accurate ﬁts than
those based on dose level. The baseline pEGFR0 and Imax values
were set equal to 1 based on the assumption that the phosphorylation of EGFR was not inhibited in the absence of
geﬁtinib and that it could be fully inhibited at high geﬁtinib
tumor concentrations, respectively. To reduce parameter estimation difﬁculties, the value of Kin, a variable representing
the formation of pEGFR, was ﬁxed in the low-dose group to a
value equal to that obtained from the high-dose pharmacodynamic model and indicated that the synthesis rate of pEGFR
was not inﬂuenced by dose. The IC50 values were found to be
dose-dependent with a higher value (3-fold) obtained at the 150
mg/kg dose level. The transfer rate constant, ktr, a variable that

reﬂects signal transduction efﬁciency from pEGFR to pERK
showed an inverse relationship with dose indicative of reduced
signaling efﬁciency at higher geﬁtinib concentrations. The
model that predicted ABEC, which provides a measure of
cumulative degree of inhibition (34), indicated there was a
minimal difference in the ABEC values as a function of the MPI
groups in both the high- and low-dose groups; yet, dosedependent increases in the model-predicted ABEC values were
obtained; being 1.26-fold, 1.24-fold, and 1.15-fold for the high,
medium, and low MPI groups, respectively (Table 3).

Discussion
Most preclinical pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic studies in brain tumor-bearing mice are based on measurements
from whole tumor homogenates that rely on the assumption of
homogeneous drug distribution (i.e., single averaged drug
concentration) for interpretation. However, it is well known
that tumors are heterogeneous with regard to vascularity,
blood ﬂow, and interstitial ﬂuid pressure and more recently
genomic characteristics that could impact both pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic variability, and ultimately, personalized medicine (5). As individualized medicine moves
forward, an accounting of intratumoral pharmacokinetic/
pharmacodynamic heterogeneity is necessary to not only
understand why drugs may be inactive, but further to offer
computational approaches to mitigate the effects of tumor
heterogeneity. Models of regional pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics provide a tool to design improved dosing
schedules to attain therapeutic relevant pharmacokinetic concentrations in the entire tumor that will produce optimal
pharmacodynamic effects. It can be appreciated that such
pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic models will become
increasingly important as multidrug combinations are designed that may be subject to drug–drug interactions, both
in the pharmacokinetic sphere as well as in the pharmacodynamic sphere where drugs act on the same and intersecting cell
signaling pathways. The current study characterized the intratumoral pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics of geﬁtinib, a model EGFR inhibitor, and as a ﬁrst
investigation in this area, began to unravel how such data
may be modeled to enhance our understanding of intratumoral
pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics.
A pivotal advance in our approach was to develop a tumor
sampling scheme that was readily accessible and provided
regional pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic measurements that could be related to biologic characteristics of the
tumor measured by immunohistochemistry. Adjacent serial
sections were assigned to pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, or IHC analyses and in this particular investigation,
four such regions were obtained at 1 mm intervals in the
coronal direction. Both geﬁtinib concentration and pERK
measurements required about ﬁve adjacent 12 mm tissue
sections or about 1 mg of brain tumor, whereas, IHC analyses
could be completed on each 12 mm section that were interdigitated between the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic sections that served as a means to bin the pharmacokinetic
and pharmacodynamic data. This procedure, by combining

5250

adjacent tissue sections, does lump or average the measurements, yet much less so than whole-tumor homogenates and
with potential improvements in assay sensitivities improved
resolution can be expected. Overall, the tumor sectioning
protocol permitted each animal to contribute regional pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic/IHC measurements that facilitated our understanding of tumor heterogeneity.
Before the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic investigations in brain tumor-bearing mice, in vitro pharmacodynamic
biomarker studies were conducted in U87vIII cells to conﬁrm
that pERK could be used as a pharmacodynamic marker
(Supplementary Fig. S5). The in vivo studies were then completed at two dose levels to assess dose-dependent changes in
intratumoral pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics; the high
geﬁtinib dose of 150 mg/kg was based on previous preclinical
studies that showed this dose to be the highest nontoxic oral
dose and a dose of 50 mg/kg was chosen based on previous
studies related to geﬁtinib's interactions with Pgp at the BBB
(32). As the brain tumor vasculature has been reported to show
regional variability in Pgp expression (higher at the tumor
periphery; ref. 35), it was important to include Pgp in our
analysis.
The orthotopic brain tumor model possessed mutant EGFR
(EGFRvIII) that is more sensitive to geﬁtinib than the widely
used parental line, U87MG. The EGFRvIII variant has been
reported to form a discreet well circumscribed intracerebral
tumor mass, with a more aggressive phenotype than the
U87MG tumors (36) and hence, more likely to recapitulate
the phenotype of brain tumors in patients. The intratumoral
variability of geﬁtinib pharmacokinetics [AUC(0–24h)] was
about 2-fold and comparable with a 3-fold intratumoral variability reported for geﬁtinib brain tumor concentrations in a
single patient receiving a multiple-dose regimen of 500 mg/day
(23). The slightly lower intratumoral variability in geﬁtinib
brain tumor concentrations observed at the 150 mg/kg geﬁtinib dose could be attributed to saturation of efﬂux transporters at the BBB, and thus, limit Michaelis–Menten transport
that is sensitive to concentration changes and likely to exhibit
greater variability. The variability in the intratumoral concentrations of geﬁtinib did not directly translate into the same
degree of pharmacodynamic variability based on pERK measurements that were fairly uniform especially after high-dose
administration (Fig. 2C) and could indicate geﬁtinib brain
tumor concentrations were sufﬁciently high to produce near
maximal inhibition of pERK. Although pERK regional variability was, modest it should be appreciated that drugs that exhibit
steep concentration-response curves will be prone to greater
variability; apparently, the geﬁtinib concentration-pERK relationship in U87vIII tumors is not.
The tumor vasculature exhibited signiﬁcant intratumoral
variability and was depicted according to MPI values. Many
studies have reported the role of pericytes in regulating vascular integrity and maturity via regulation of endothelial cell
proliferation, formation of tight junctions, and the composition of the extracellular matrix around vessels (37–39). The
negative correlation obtained between MPI and geﬁtinib concentrations indicated that a more mature or functionally intact
BBB (higher MPI) was a factor that impaired the delivery of

Intratumoral Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic Modeling

geﬁtinib to brain tumors. Antiangiogenic treatment can inﬂuence tumor distribution of coadministered drugs; both
increased and decreased drug delivery has been reported,
which is related to a so-called vascular normalization process
associated with increased pericyte coverage, decreased permeability, and IFP (24, 40–42). Although our study design
prevents drawing directly from these analyses we do show
that a more functionally intact BBB limits geﬁtinib distribution
into tumors, which is in agreement with previous reports on
geﬁtinib brain distribution (43, 44).
The pharmacokinetic characteristics of geﬁtinib were most
different in the low- and high-MPI groups that were explained
by different BBB transport, and in terms of model parameters,
were attributed to transcellular diffusion (i.e., h) and active
efﬂux by Pgp (Vmax). Both parameters, h and Vmax, were found
to be MPI-dependent, which is consistent with previous
reports that pericytes regulate vascular integrity and maturity
(37–39). One of these studies showed that the lack of pericyte
coverage was associated with destabilized and permeable
tumor vessels, resulting in increased metastasis (37–39).
Another study showed greater biotin leakage into mouse brain
that was attributed to lower pericyte coverage of brain microvessels. These reports support our contention that higher
transcellular diffusion would be expected in vessels with less
pericyte coverage or low MPI. The Vmax dependence on MPI
was consistent with the observed lower Pgp expression in the
regions with low MPI and a previous report that found Pgp
expression negatively correlated with immature cerebral
capillaries (33). Paracellular transport (Kp) of geﬁtinib was
independent of MPI status, which seems reasonable because
the basis for paracellular transport of geﬁtinib is large endothelial cell gaps that are characteristic of the physically disrupted BBB found in brain tumors (45).
Tumor pERK proﬁles predicted by the model agreed with the
observed results in the low- and high-dose groups in all MPI
groups. The pharmacodynamic model showed a dose-dependent increase in IC50, a similar phenomenon that has been
observed previously (46, 26, 47), yet not always attached to a
deﬁnitive mechanism. In one case, a dose-dependent change in
EC50 was reported when a single drug acted simultaneously on
two different receptors or targets (48). In a similar context,
although geﬁtinib is known for its highly selective and potent
EGFR inhibition, it targets at least 20 other kinases, albeit with
higher IC50 values than for EGFR. One such target is at higher
concentrations, as it inhibits another intracellular kinase called

cyclin G-associated kinase (49), that negatively regulates EGFR
signaling, (50). By removing this negative feedback mechanism,
more geﬁtinib is required to inhibit the intended target
(pEGFR) and thus, the higher IC50 value at the high-dose level.
We do not have direct evidence to support this mechanism
but the plausibility of this dose dependency was supported
by the model.
In summary, the study successfully illustrates how intratumoral heterogeneity in the biologic characteristics of the
tumor can result in variable drug exposure and pharmacodynamic response, albeit to a limited extent in this case. Nonetheless, the ability to characterize regional pharmacokinetic/
pharmacodynamic information from tumors, made accessible
through a tumor sectioning protocol, is advantageous to
understand potential reasons for drug inactivity that traditional pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic studies based on
tumor homogenates cannot offer. By combining pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic/IHC measurements regional PBPK/
pharmacodynamic models, highlighted by variable BBB integrity, were developed that had the drugs' efﬁcacy been under
evaluation could be used to examine alternate dosing strategies to attain therapeutically relevant concentration and
pharmacodynamic effects throughout the tumor. Intratumoral pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic models provide
an additional means to improve chemotherapy for glioblastoma multiformes.
