BACKGROUND: Epigenetic dysregulation is a hallmark of cancer, including multiple myeloma. Inhibitors of histone deacetylases (HDACs) induce DNA hyperacetylation by inhibiting removal of acetyl groups from amino tails on histone proteins,
thereby uncoiling condensed chromatin favoring transcription of silenced genes, including tumor suppressor genes.
Romidepsin is an HDAC inhibitor that exhibits antiproliferative and apoptotic effects against multiple myeloma cell lines.
METHODS: A phase 2 trial was performed of romidepsin in patients with multiple myeloma who were refractory to standard therapy. Treatment was comprised of romidepsin (13 mg/m2) given as a 4-hour intravenous infusion on Days 1, 8, and
15 every 28 days). Thirteen patients received a median of 2 cycles of therapy (range, 1-7 cycles). RESULTS: Although no
patients had an objective response, 4 of 12 patients with secretory myeloma exhibited evidence of M-protein stabilization, and several other patients experienced improvement in bone pain and resolution of hypercalcemia.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of the current study demonstrate that romidepsin, as a single agent, is unlikely to be associated with a response rate of 30% in patients with refractory myeloma, although there was some clinical evidence suggesting a biological effect associated with therapy.

Multiple myeloma (MM) is a clonal plasma cell neoplasm in which malignant cells are arrested at various stages of cell
differentiation.1 The identification of novel oncogenes, chromosomal breakpoints, and immunoglobulin gene translocations has led to improved classification and understanding of the pathogenesis of the disease.2 Agents that can modify or
regulate the expression of both established and newly discovered oncogenes involved in the clinical course and development of MM may be essential in defining new targets for treatment.3
Recent evidence suggests that the epigenome, which regulates gene expression, may be a promising therapeutic target
in MM. Indeed, epigenomic dysregulation of DNA methylation and histone acetylation is a hallmark of cancer, including
MM.4-6 Acetylation of histones allows the chromatin structure surrounding the protein to relax, thereby enabling gene
transcription. In contrast, histone deacetylation results in tightly wound and compact chromatin, which impedes transcription. Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors induce DNA hyperacetylation by inhibiting removal of acetyl groups
from amino tails on histone proteins, thereby de-repressing silenced genes, including tumor suppressor genes. HDAC is a
validated therapeutic target, because the HDAC inhibitors vorinostat and romidepsin are approved for the treatment of
cutaneous T-cell lymphoma.7 In addition, other HDAC inhibitors, including panobinostat, have also reported positive
effects in this malignancy.8-10 The HDAC inhibitor vorinostat has been shown to induce differentiation and apoptosis of

human MM cells,11 possibly by means of modulation of
multiple targets including the insulin-like growth factor
(IGF)/IGF-1 receptor and interleukin-6 receptor, antiapoptotic molecules, oncogenic kinases, DNA synthesis/repair
enzymes, and transcription factors.12 HDAC inhibitors
such as vorinostat also enhance the effectiveness of standard
MM therapies, including bortezomib, dexamethasone, cytotoxic chemotherapy, and thalidomide analogs.11
Romidepsin (formerly known as despipeptide,
FR901228, or FK228) is a cyclic peptide HDAC inhibitor
that has been shown in vitro to induce apoptosis by downregulation of the BCL-2 family of proteins (BCL-XL and
MCL-1), and induce G1 cell cycle arrest (by enhancing
expression of p21 and p53).13 Phase 1 to 2 trials have shown
that romidepsin is effective for the treatment of cutaneous
and peripheral T-cell lymphomas.9,10,14,15 The dosage of
romidepsin in its phase 1 trial was 1 to 24.9 mg/m2; doselimiting toxicities included fatigue, nausea, vomiting, thrombocytopenia, and cardiac arrhythmia.15 At the recommended phase 2 dose of 17.8 mg/m2, romidepsin increased
histone acetylation in patient-derived peripheral blood
mononuclear cells, and also altered cell cycle kinetics of PC3
cells in culture.15 Although the recommended phase 2 dose
was initially 17.8 mg/m2 given over 4-hour infusion on
Days 1 and 5 of a 21-day cycle, a subsequent amendment to
the phase 2 protocol recommended dose reduction to 13 to
14 mg/m2 on Days 1, 8, and 15 every 28 days due to better
patient tolerability.16 Based on the aforementioned data, we
designed a phase 2 trial to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and
biologic effects of romidepsin monotherapy in patients with
refractory or recurrent MM to provide a framework for integration of romidepsin with other standard therapies.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Eligibility
Eligibility criteria included patients with recurrent and/or
refractory stage IIa to IIIa MM who had received at least 2
prior lines of therapy. Other criteria included Karnofsky
performance score of at least 70%; age 18 years; and
adequate bone marrow (leukocyte count 3000/lL, neutrophil count 1500/lL, and platelet count 100,000/
lL), hepatic (total bilirubin <2.0 mg/dL, and aspartate
aminotransferase/alanine aminotransferase 2.5-fold the
upper limits of normal), renal (serum creatinine 1.5
mg/dL or creatinine clearance 60 mL/min/1.73 m2),
and cardiac (left ventricular ejection fraction 50% and
normal electrocardiogram) function. Prior chemotherapy
or radiotherapy was permitted if administered >4 weeks
before enrollment (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin

C). Patients with a history of prior treatment with an
HDAC inhibitor or an uncontrolled intercurrent illness
(including cardiac arrhythmias) were excluded.
Treatment Regimen
Patients received romidepsin at a dose of 13 mg/m2 as a 4hour infusion on Days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28-day cycle. All
patients were treated for at least 4 weeks, or equivalently,
for at least 1 full cycle of treatment. After the first cycle,
patients with progressive disease were discontinued from
the study and all others proceeded to the next 4-week cycle.
A maintenance regimen of romidepsin every other week
(Days 1 and 15) was permitted for those reaching a stable
plateau (25% serum M-protein levels or urine protein
excretion over 3 consecutive determinations, each at least 4
weeks apart). Treatment continued until the occurrence of
disease progression, an adverse event requiring discontinuation, or withdrawal of patient consent. All patients received
8 mg of ondansetron for antiemetic prophylaxis at 1 hour
before and every 8 hours thereafter for 24 to 48 hours after
romidepsin infusion. Additional antiemetic treatment was
administered based on patient symptoms. Thrombocytopenia was treated conservatively; in the absence of bleeding,
platelet transfusions were administered only if the platelet
count was <10,000/mm3. If the patient developed bleeding, platelet transfusions were administered in accordance
with standard practice, to maintain a platelet count of
50,000/mm3. Potassium and magnesium were administered before romidepsin administration for patients who
were either below normal or in the low to normal range of
serum levels of these electrolytes.
Baseline and Follow-Up Evaluation
Evaluation before beginning protocol therapy included
multiple gated acquisition scanning/radionuclear cardiac
angiography, skeletal survey, chest x-ray, complete serum
and urinary protein electrophoresis and immunofixation,
quantitation of serum immunoglobulin and free light
chains levels, and 24-hour urinary protein excretion. Laboratory values were obtained at screening, weekly during
study participation, and at follow-up and included complete blood count/differential, full serum chemistries, troponin I levels (or creatine kinase isoenzymes, if available),
and electrocardiography. Response to treatment was determined by standard criteria for complete response, nearcomplete response, partial response, stable disease, and progressive disease of MM.17 All patients who completed at
least 1 cycle were assessed for response to treatment. Measurable disease was defined as 1.0 g/dL serum monoclonal

protein, 0.1 g/dL serum-free light chains, 0.2 g/24hour urinary M-protein excretion, and/or measurable plasmacytomas. Criteria for primary response were adopted
from the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplant/International Bone Marrow Transplant Registry/Autologous Blood and Marrow Transplant Registry of North
America (EBMT/IBMTR/ABMTR)18 and international
uniform response criteria for MM.17
The National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) (version 3.0)
was used to grade adverse events. Toxicity was defined as
an adverse event possibly, probably, or definitely related
to the study treatment. Data from all subjects who
received any study drug were included in the safety analysis. The frequency of subjects experiencing a specific
adverse event was tabulated.
Correlative Studies
Bone marrow aspirates (5-10 mL) and biopsy specimens
were collected from 3 consenting patients at baseline, 24
hours after the first treatment, and 28 days after the first
treatment for correlative studies. The samples underwent
Ficoll separation, with CD138Ã¾ plasma cells selected by
radiolabeled microbeads. Phenotype analysis was performed
by immunohistochemistry for CD138/Ki-67 proliferation
index, fibroblast growth factor receptor 3, CD31 (platelet
endothelial cell adhesion molecule), and cleaved caspase 3.
Statistical Objectives and
Statistical Plan
The primary objectives of the study were to evaluate the
safety and efficacy of romidepsin as a therapy for patients
with advanced refractory or recurrent MM. The study was
designed to distinguish between a response rate of 10%
versus 25%. The optimal 2-stage design of Simon was
used, in which the probability of a type I error and the
probability of a type II error were both set at 10%. If 3
responses occurred during the initial phase, accrual would
be terminated. If there were 8 total responses reported
among the patients, the study would be considered promising. The trial was halted after accrual of 13 patients
when no objective responses were noted. A post hoc analysis indicated that it was unlikely that the response rate
would exceed 30% (type I and II error rates of 10%).

consent.

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
Thirteen patients were enrolled at 3 participating institutions between December 2003 and May 2006. The characteristics of the patient population are shown in Table 1.
All patients had evidence of disease progression before
enrollment. The median age was 57 years (range, 54-74
years), the median disease duration was 6 years (range,
2.3-11.3 years), and the median number of prior treatment regimens was 3 (range, 2-4), including 9 patients
(69%) who had had a prior stem cell transplantation, 9
patients (69%) who had received thalidomide (N Â¼ 8) or
lenalinomide (N Â¼ 1), and 6 patients (46%) who had
received prior bortezomib. Pretreatment fluorescence in
situ hybridization in 10 patients identified 2 patients with
del 13q14 (including 1 with t(11;14)), 1 with tetrasomy
11, 1 with trisomy 11, and 6 with no abnormalities. Conventional cytogenetics identified 1 patient with inversion
in chromosome 9.
Treatment Administration and Efficacy
Thirteen patients received an aggregate total of 27 treatment cycles; the median number of cycles given was 2
(range, 1-7 cycles). Reasons for discontinuation of therapy
included disease progression in 6 patients (46%), an intercurrent bone fracture requiring surgery in 1 patient (8%),
and patient withdrawal in 6 patients (46%) due to lack of

response. Twelve of 13 patients were assessable for
response by serum protein electrophoresis, urine protein
electrophoresis, or free light chain measurement, which
were obtained both at baseline as well as after each cycle of
treatment; 1 patient had nonsecretory disease. No patients
met the criteria for objective response. Four patients
(31%; 95% confidence interval, 9%-61%) exhibited stabilization of M-protein levels during therapy (Fig. 1).
There was no consistency in therapy preceding romidepsin indicative of a priming effect; the preceding treatment
included bortezomib (Patient 1), thalidomide plus clarithromycin (Patient 2), melphalan (Patient 3), and LymphoRad-131 (Patient 11). Five patients demonstrated
clinical benefit with improvement of hypercalcemia, and
2 patients reported improvement of pain. Nevertheless,
the trial was halted after accrual of 13 patients because it
was statistically unlikely that the objective response rate
would exceed 30%.

Correlative Studies
In 3 patients who exhibited M-protein stabilization, we evaluated bone marrow samples before therapy, 24 hours after
the first romidepsin treatment, and 28 days after the first
treatment, at which point patients would have been exposed
to a total of 3 romidepsin infusions. Cell cycle marker evaluation in CD138Ã¾ selected plasma cells revealed no detectable alteration in cell cycle kinetics in vivo (Fig. 2). In
addition, evaluation of BCL-2, MCL-1, CD31, and cleaved
caspase 3 revealed no detectable modulation in vivo (Fig. 3).

DISCUSSION
We evaluated the HDAC inhibitor romidepsin in heavily
pretreated patients with MM who were refractory to multiple therapies, often including stem cell transplantation,
thalidomide, and bortezomib. Although no patients
achieved an objective response, approximately 30% of
patients exhibited stabilization of M-protein production,
indicating a biologic effect. Several patients also exhibited
resolution of hypercalcemia or improvement in bone
pain, also potentially indicative of a biologic effect. Romidepsin did not appear to modulate apoptosis or cell cycle
kinetics in vivo, even in those patients who exhibited serum M-protein stabilization. Even with this demonstrated
clinical activity, it still appears that romidepsin monotherapy is unlikely to produce a significant objective response
(in terms of M-protein reduction) in patients with refractory myeloma.
Numerous reports indicate that several HDAC
inhibitors have significant antineoplastic effects in myeloma cell lines, including vorinostat,11 romidepsin,13
LAQ824,20 and R306465.21 However, to the best of our
knowledge, our experience represents only the third report
evaluating the clinical activity of an HDAC inhibitor as
single agent in patients with MM. Richardson et al
reported a phase 1 trial of vorinostat at various doses and
schedules in 13 patients with refractory myeloma; 1
patient exhibited a minor response and 9 patients were
reported to have stable disease.22 Gimsing et al reported
disease stabilization in 1 patient with myeloma treated
with the HDAC inhibitor belinostat (PXD101).23 The
results of the current trial are consistent with these reports,
indicating that HDAC inhibitors do not induce tumor
regression, but do appear to induce some biological effects
that may have clinical relevance.
Romidepsin and other HDAC inhibitors have been
shown to enhance the effect of bortezomib in myeloma
cell lines,24-27 and in some cases also inhibit osteoclasts.
Recently, we reported the results of a phase 1 trial in recurrent and refractory MM, in which vorinostat administered
at a dose of 400 mg daily for 8 days in conjunction with
Cancer

bortezomib at 1.3 mg/m2 proved to be safe and effective,
with responses in patients who were previously proven
bortezomib-unresponsive.28 Similar encouraging results
have been reported on a phase 1 to 2 trial of romidepsin in
combination with dexamethasone and bortezomib.29
Based on these results, several trials are currently in
progress evaluating the combination of romidepsin
and bortezomib in MM and vorinostat in combination
with lenalidomide (NCT00642954, NCT00729118) or
pegylated liposomal doxorubicin plus bortezomib
(NCT00744353). Moreover, an ongoing phase 3 trial is
currently evaluating bortezomib alone or in combination
with vorinostat (NCT0077347). This and other trials
will serve to define the future role of HDAC inhibitors
in MM.
