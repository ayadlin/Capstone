Abstract
Antiangiogenesis therapies for the treatment of cancers hold
the promise of high efficacy and low toxicity. In vivo phage
display was used to identify peptides specifically targeting
tumor blood vessels. The peptide SP5-52 recognized tumor
neovasculature but not normal blood vessels in severe
combined immunodeficiency mice bearing human tumors.
Synthetic peptide was shown to inhibit the binding of PC5-52
phage particles to the tumor mass in the competitive
inhibition assay. Several selected phage clones displayed the
consensus motif, proline-serine-proline, and this motif was
crucial for peptide binding to the tumor neovasculature. SP552 peptides also bound vascular endothelial growth factor–
stimulated human umbilical vein endothelial cells and blood
vessels of human lung cancer surgical specimens. Furthermore, this targeting phage was shown to home to tumor
tissues from eight different types of human tumor xenografts
following in vivo phage display experiments. An SP5-52
peptide-linked liposome carrying doxorubicin enhanced the
therapeutic efficacy of the drug, markedly decreased tumor
blood vessels, and resulted in higher survival rates of human
lung and oral cancer–bearing xenograft mice. The current
study indicates that ligand-targeted therapy offers improved
therapeutic effects over conventional anticancer drug therapy,
and that the peptide SP5-52 specifically targets tumor
neovasculature and is a good candidate for targeted drug
delivery to solid tumors. [Cancer Res 2007;67(22):10958–65]

Introduction
During tumor progression, tumor cells require increased
supplies of oxygen and metabolites, and the efficient removal of
waste products. In fact, establishing access to the host vascular
system and the generation of a tumor blood supply are the ratelimiting steps of the tumor progression process (1). Tumor blood
vessels are prime targets for therapies involving the inhibition of
tumor growth, and these vessels express specific markers which are
absent in the blood vessels of normal tissues. Many of these specific
marker molecules, selectively expressed in tumor blood vessels, are
proteins associated with tumor-induced angiogenesis, the sprouting of new blood vessels (2). These include the cell adhesion
receptors, integrins, avh3 and avh5, which are overexpressed in the

tumor vasculature (3). Indeed, avh3 was recognized by an RGD
peptide previously identified by in vivo phage display for tumor
homing (4). Certain peptide ligands specific to these integrins have
already been tested for the targeted delivery of anticancer and
antiangiogenic agents (5). The finding of heterogeneity in the
vasculature of normal and cancerous tissues provides promising
opportunities for the targeted delivery of therapies.
Conventional chemotherapy is limited by the toxicity of the
drugs to normal tissues. However, if these drugs could be
preferentially directed to tumor sites or vessels instead of normal
tissues, the toxic effects would be limited to the intended tumor
tissue. Most small-molecule chemotherapeutic agents have a large
volume of distribution on i.v. administration (6), often leading to a
narrow therapeutic index due to the high toxicity to normal tissues.
However, through encapsulation of the drugs in a macromolecular
carrier, such as liposomes, the volume of distribution is significantly reduced and the concentration of drug in the tumor is
increased (7). Liposomal doxorubicin represents a new class of
chemotherapy delivery system that significantly improves the
therapeutic index of doxorubicin in both preclinical (8–10) and
clinical pharmacokinetics (11–13). This decreases the amount and
types of nonspecific toxicity and increases the amount of drug that
can be effectively delivered to the tumor site (8, 14).
A tumor-targeting ligand may be a more effective method of
directing liposomes containing drugs to the tumor site, increasing
the therapeutic efficacy of liposomal drugs. For solid malignancies,
which comprise >90% of human cancers, antibodies recognizing
tumor-specific antigens have thus far provided little use for drug
delivery because the immunoconjugates are too large to penetrate
the tumor tissue (15, 16). However, phage-displayed peptide
libraries have allowed the identification of small peptides a
hundredth the mass of IgG antibodies, which might facilitate the
development of such intervention strategies.
Phage-displayed random peptide libraries provide opportunities
to map B-cell epitopes (17–20) and protein-protein contacts
(21–23), and to select bioactive peptides bound to receptors
(24, 25) or proteins (22, 26–28). They can be used to search for
disease-specific antigen mimics (29–31), and to determine cellspecific (32, 33) and organ-specific peptides (5, 28, 34). Screening
phage-displayed peptide libraries against specific target tissues is
therefore a direct and fast method for identifying peptide
sequences which might be used for the targeting of drug or gene
delivery vectors. In this study, we used a phage-displayed random
peptide library to identify targeting peptides that could specifically
bind to the tumor vessels of several tumor types. When coupled to
liposomes containing the anticancer drug doxorubicin (Lipo-Dox),
one targeting peptide, SP5-52, enhanced the efficacy of the drug
against both human lung and oral cancer xenografts in severe
combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice. Our results indicate
that this peptide has clinical potential as a drug delivery agent in
the treatment of these tumors.

A Peptide for Targeted Drug Delivery to Tumor Blood Vessels

Materials and Methods
Cell lines and cell culture. CL1-5 (lung cancer), H460 (lung cancer), and
PC3 (prostate cancer) were grown in RPMI 1640 containing 10% FCS (Life
Technologies) at 37jC under a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5%
CO2 (v/v). SAS (oral cancer), HCT116 (colon cancer), BT483 (breast cancer),
Mahlavu (liver cancer), and PaCa (pancreatic cancer) were grown in DMEM
(Life Technologies) containing 5% FCS, in a 10% CO2 incubator. CL1-5 was
established by Chu et al. (35). H460, HCT116, BT483, PC3, Mahlavu, and
PaCa were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. Human
umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were isolated from the umbilical
vein after separation from the placenta, and grown in M199 medium (Life
Technologies) supplemented with 20% FCS and 15 Ag/mL of endothelial cell
growth supplement (Upstate) in a 5% CO2 incubator.
In vivo phage display biopanning procedures. SCID mice 4 to 6 weeks
of age were injected s.c. into the dorsolateral flank with CL1-5 cells to
produce lung cancer xenografts. A phage-displayed peptide library (New
England Biolabs, Inc.), which initially contained 5  1010 plaque-forming
units (pfu), was injected through the tail vein of SCID mice bearing sizematched CL1-5–derived tumors (f500 mm3). After 8 min of phage
circulation, the mice were treated with diethyl ether to drive them into deep
anesthesia, and perfused with 50 mL of PBS to wash out unbound phage.
The control organs (lungs, heart, brain) and tumor masses were removed,
weighed, and washed with cold PBS. The organs and tumor samples were
homogenized and the phage particles were rescued by ER2738 bacteria
(New England Biolabs). The phages were titered on agar plates in the
presence of 1 mg/L of IPTG/X-gel. Bound phages were amplified and
subjected to four consecutive rounds of biopanning using SCID mice
bearing lung cancer xenografts prepared as described above, except that a
phage input of 2  1011 pfu was used. The phages eluted from the fifth
round were titered on LB/IPTG/X-Gal plates. The candidate tumor-homing
phage clones were randomly selected and identified by cellular ELISA and
in vivo homing experiments.
DNA sequencing and computer analysis. DNA sequences of the
selected phages were determined according to the dideoxynucleotide chain
termination method using an automated DNA sequencer (ABI PRISM 377;
Perkin-Elmer). Sequencing was done with the primer 5¶-CCCTCATAGTTAGCGTAACG-3¶ corresponding to the pIII gene sequence. The phagedisplayed peptide sequences were translated and aligned using the Genetics
Computer Group program.
Peptide synthesis. The peptides, SVSVGMKPSPRP (SP5-52), SVSVGMKGGGRP (MP5-52), and control peptide RLLDTNRPLLPY were synthesized
and purified by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography to
>95% purity by Invitrogene, Inc. Conjugation of these peptides with FITC or
biotin was done by the same company by adding FITC or biotin to the NH2
terminus.
In vivo homing experiments and peptide binding in xenograft
tumor vessels. Phage clones (109 pfu) or control helper phage (insertless
phages) were injected into the tail vein of tumor xenograft mice which were
then kept for 8 min. After perfusion, xenograft tumors and organs were
removed and titered. In peptide-competitive inhibition experiments, phage
clones were coinjected with 100 Ag of synthetic peptide. After injection of
targeting or control phage clones, the organs and tumors were removed and
divided into two parts. One part was titered by ER2738, and another part
was embedded in optimal cutting temperature (Tissue-Tek). The optimal
cutting temperature–embedded frozen tissues were sectioned at 5 Am and
transferred to cold PBS buffer. The sections were fixed with acetone/
methanol (1:1), washed with PBS and immersed in blocking buffer (1%
bovine serum albumin in PBS) for 1 h. Then, the sections were incubated
with rat anti-mouse CD31 (BD PharMingen), rabbit anti-rat antibody
(Stressgen, Canada) and immersed in rhodamine-labeled goat anti-rabbit
antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch). The slides were further incubated
with mouse anti-M13 antibody (Amersham Biosciences), followed by FITClabeled goat anti-mouse antibody ( Jackson ImmunoResearch), and
immersed in Hoechst 33258 (Molecular Probes). Finally, slides were washed
and mounted with mounting medium (Vector). In the same way, we injected
FITC-labeled targeting peptides and control peptide in place of the phages,

www.aacrjournals.org

into tumor xenograft mice for a peptide-binding assay. After perfusion,
tissues were removed and treated as above. Slides were examined under
a Leica Universal microscope. Images were merged by SimplePCI software
(C-IMAGING).
Targeting peptide binding to vascular endothelial growth factor–
stimulated HUVECs and lung cancer biopsy specimens. HUVECs were
plated and grown to f80% confluence on coverslips. The cells were
pretreated with 20 ng/mL of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF; R&D
Systems) and 2 ng/mL of basic fibroblast growth factor (Peprotech) for 48 h.
The VEGF-stimulated HUVECs were washed with serum-free M199 plus 3%
BSA, incubated in blocking buffer for 30 min at 4jC and then with phages at
4jC for 1 h. They were washed and fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde for
10 min, followed by incubation with mouse anti-M13 monoclonal antibody
(Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h, and then FITC-labeled anti-mouse
antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch), followed by staining in Hoechst
33258. The coverslips were finally washed and mounted.
For localization of the peptide-binding ability on lung cancer tissue,
frozen sections of human lung adenocarcinoma were incubated with biotinlabeled peptide using routine immunohistochemical procedures. The frozen
surgical specimens were obtained from the tissue bank of National Taiwan
University Hospital with approval from the Institutional Review Boards
(IRB9461702021).
Preparation of peptide-liposome containing doxorubicin. Procedures for the preparation of peptide-liposomes containing doxorubicin were
adapted from the methods published in previous reports (33, 36). Briefly,
peptide ligands were coupled to NHS/PEG/DSPE [N-hydroxysuccinimidocarboxyl/polyethylene glycol (PEG; average molecular weight, 3,000)–
derived/distearoylphosphatidylethanolamine; NOF Corporation] in a 1:1.5
molar ratio. The reaction was completed and confirmed by quantitation of
the remaining amino groups, measured using a trinitrobenzenesulfonate
reagent (37). Peptidyl-PEG/DSPE was transferred to preformed liposomes
after coincubation at a temperature above the transition temperature of
the lipid bilayer (38). The liposomes had a particle size ranging from 65 to
75 nm in diameter (33). There were 300 to 500 peptide molecules per
liposome, computed as described previously (39).
Animal model for study of ligand-targeted therapy. Human lung
(CL1-5) and oral (SAS) cancer xenografts were established in SCID mice.
Mice 4 to 6 weeks of age were injected s.c. into the dorsolateral flank
with human cancer cells. Mice with size-matched tumors (tumor sizes of
f100 mm3) were randomly assigned to different treatment groups and
treated with SP5-52-Lipo-Dox, Lipo-Dox, or equivalent volumes of PBS i.v.
at a total doxorubicin dose of 7 mg/kg (1 mg/kg, twice a week). Mouse body
weight and tumor size were measured twice a week using calipers. The
tumor volumes were calculated using the equation: length  (width)2 
0.52. The differences in mean tumor volume were evaluated by ANOVA.
Animal care was carried out in accordance with the guidelines of Academia
Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan.

Results
Recovery of phage-displayed tumor-homing peptides from
human carcinoma xenografts. To isolate tumor-homing phages
from tumor tissues, we used a phage-displayed peptide library to
treat the NSCLC (non–small cell lung cancer; CL1-5) tumor-bearing
mice for five rounds of in vivo selection (biopanning). The recovery
rate of the fifth round of biopanning had increased 156-fold over
that of the first round (Fig. 1A). Sixty enriched phages from the fifth
round were randomly selected and sequenced. Fifty-five clones had
their displayed peptide sequences confirmed. Using a Genetics
Computer Group software, the three most frequent clones
(PC5-5, -52, and -54) were shown to have the consensus motif of
proline-serine-proline (PSP). Four clones (PC5-7, -8, -10, and -50)
had consensus amino acid residues, proline-serine (PS), whereas
another four (PC5-10, -53, -58, and -60) had the consensus amino
acid residues, serine-proline (SP; Table 1). The frequency of
PC5-52 increased to 45% (25 of 55) in the fifth cycle of biopanning

mice bearing lung cancer cell–derived tumors and then recovered
after perfusion. The titers of the phages in the tumor mass and in
other normal organs were determined. PC5-52 showed tumorhoming ability, exhibiting a concentration from 8.0- to 135-fold
higher in the tumor mass than in normal organs, including the
brain, lungs, and heart (Fig. 1B-a), whereas the control helper
phage revealed no such homing ability (Fig. 1B-b). This was also
proved by a ligand competition experiment which showed that
coinjection of synthetic SP5-52 peptide with PC5-52 phage particles
inhibited the recovery of PC5-52 from tumor tissues (Fig. 1B-b).
Coinjection of 100 Ag of SP5-52 inhibited 97% of PC5-52 homing to
the NSCLC tumor mass. Similarly, IVO-2 phage particles (which
display a peptide with the same amino acid sequence as that
displayed by PC5-52) also homed to the tumor tissues of oral
cancer xenografts (Fig. 1B-c). IVO-2 showed a 12- to 121-fold higher
concentration in tumors than in organs such as normal brain,
lungs, and heart (Fig. 1B-c). The tumor-homing ability of IVO-2
could also be inhibited by SP5-52. Coinjection of 100 Ag of
SP5-52 inhibited 95.9% of IVO-2 homing to oral cancer xenografts
(Fig. 1B-d). Control peptides did not inhibit IVO-2 homing to tumor
tissue (Fig. 1B-d). Twenty-four hours after the injection of PC5-52,
these phages had accumulated 10-fold more in tumor tissue than in
control tissues (data not shown).
The tumor-homing peptide targets tumor neovasculature.
To investigate the homing specificity of PC5-52, we used
immunofluorescent staining to identify the binding site of the
phage after perfusion. Phage particles reacted with xenograft lung
cancer tumor tissues but not with normal lung tissues (Fig. 2A).
However, phages did not localize to cancer cells. Using frozen
sections from tumor tissues incubated with anti-M13 monoclonal
antibody (green) and mouse endothelial cell marker CD31 (red),
PC5-52 was found to be colocalized with CD31 in the tumor
neovasculature of xenograft tumor tissues (Fig. 2B, i-k). The phage
was not found in vessels of normal heart (Fig. 2B-e), lungs, and
brain (data not shown).
Figure 1. Selection of lung cancer–targeting phages by in vivo phage display.
A, a phage-displayed peptide library was injected through the tail vein of
tumor-bearing mice. Phage recovered from the tumor was amplified and
re-injected in four consecutive rounds. After the fifth round of biopanning
(lane 5), the recovery rate of the phages had increased 156-fold over that of the
first round. B, identification of specificity of tumor-homing phage. a, SCID
mice bearing human lung cancer xenografts were injected i.v. with PC5-52
phage, and phage was recovered after perfusion. Recovery of PC5-52 phage
from the tumor was higher than from brain, lungs, and heart. Phage titer in
control organs compared with tumor tissues is indicated. b, recovery of lung
cancer–homing phage was competitively inhibited by the synthetic peptide
SP5-52. A background level of phage titer was recovered from the tumor mass of
mice treated with a control phage. c, SCID mice bearing human oral cancer
xenografts were injected i.v. with IVO-2 phage, and phage was recovered after
perfusion. The results show that IVO-2 phage exhibits marked homing to the
tumor compared with the control organs (brain, lungs, and heart) in the same
mouse. Phage titer in control organs compared with tumor tissues is indicated.
d, recovery of oral cancer–homing phage is competitively inhibited by the
synthetic peptide SP5-52. However, control peptides have no such effect.

(Table 1). Interestingly, we also identified this sequence, SVSVGMKPSPRP (SP5-52), in a separate study using oral cancer for in vivo
phage display, on a phage we named, IVO-2 (Table 1; Fig. 1B-c).
IVO-2 was isolated from oral cancer xenografts by in vivo phage
display and displayed the same amino acid sequence as PC5-52.
Due to its high frequency and the possibility of universal expression
in tumor vessels, we focused on this peptide for further study.

targeting ability of PC5-52, phages were injected into the tail vein of

A Peptide for Targeted Drug Delivery to Tumor Blood Vessels

Figure 2. Localization of phages
displaying tumor-homing peptide.
A, immunofluorescent localization of
PC5-52 after i.v. injection into human lung
cancer bearing mice. The immunoreactivity
of phages are localized in tumor masses
(a), whereas no reaction product is
observed in normal lungs (c ). b and d,
cells counterstained for nuclear DNA with
H33258 corresponding to a and c ,
respectively (bar, 20 Am). B, investigation
of tumor-homing phage binding to tumor
vessels of lung cancer xenograft. Mice
were injected with tumor-homing phages
by i.v. injection. Tumor and organ tissues
were immunostained with anti-M13 and
anti-CD31 antibodies. Anti-phage
immunofluorescence is colocalized with
anti-CD31 on tumor neovasculature
endothelia after phage injection (i, j, and k).
Control phage cannot bind to tumor vessels
(a). The tumor-homing phage cannot
recognize the normal heart (e). Anti-CD31
in heart vessels (f and g) and xenograft
tumor vessels (b, c, j, and k ). Nuclear
staining by H33258 (d, h, and l ). C, binding
of FITC-labeled SP5-52 peptide to tumor
vessels of lung cancer xenografts.
FITC-labeled SP5-52 could bind to human
lung cancer xenograft sections (i ) and
colocalizes with anti-CD31 on tumor
neovasculature (k ). An FITC-labeled
control peptide did not bind lung cancer
xenografts (a) and SP5-52 did not bind to a
control heart tissue (e). Anti-CD31 in the
human lung cancer xenografts (b and j)
and normal heart (f ) vessels. Nuclear
staining by H33258 in d, h and l
(bar, 20 Am).

To further investigate phage-displayed peptide homing to the
tumor neovasculature, we used an FITC-labeled SP5-52 peptide in
place of the PC5-52 phage. FITC-labeled SP5-52 peptides also
colocalized with mouse CD31 marker in the tumor neovasculature
of lung cancer xenografts (Fig. 2C, i-k). They were not detected in
normal heart vessels (Fig. 2C, e-g ). FITC-labeled control peptides
did not recognize tumor neovasculature (Fig. 2C, a-c).
Phages displaying the SP5-52 sequence were isolated from lung
and oral cancer xenografts by in vivo phage display. To test the
hypothesis that the target of SP5-52 may be universally expressed in
the neovasculature of solid tumors, we examined the homing
ability of PC5-52 in six other types of human cancers including

www.aacrjournals.org

human lung (H460), colon (HCT116), breast (BT483), prostate
(PC3), liver (Mahlavu), and pancreatic (PaCa) cancer xenografts.
Interestingly, in all of these human cancer xenografts, PC5-52
targeted tumor tissues but not normal organs like brain, heart, and
lungs (Fig. 3A). Control phage without this targeting ligand had no
such homing ability (data not shown).
From in vivo phage display, we identified three clones (PC5-5,
-52, and -54) with a PSP consensus motif (Table 1). We proposed
that these three amino acid residues play a crucial role in homing
to tumor tissues. To test this hypothesis, we changed these three
amino acid residues in SP5-52 (SVSVGMKPSPRP) to GGG in
a mutant peptide, MP5-52 (SVSVGMKGGGRP). PC5-52 targeted

CL1-5–derived tumors in an in vivo homing assay (Fig. 3B-a) and
this tumor-homing ability was markedly inhibited by the peptide,
SP5-52 (Fig. 3B-b). However, competitive inhibition was lost when
the consensus motif PSP of SP5-52 had been changed to GGG in
MP5-52 (Fig. 3B-c).
PC5-52 reacts with stimulated HUVECs and human lung
cancer biopsy specimens. We showed that PC5-52 targets the
mouse neovasculature endothelia of tumor tissues. To identify
whether this phage has affinity for human neovasculature
endothelia, we applied the PC5-52 phage particles to VEGFstimulated HUVECs. PC5-52 bound to VEGF-stimulated HUVECs
(Fig. 4A-a), whereas the control phage without this peptide showed
no binding activity (Fig. 4A-b). HUVECs without VEGF stimulation
did not display PC5-52 binding (Fig. 4A-c). SP5-52 (100 Ag/mL)
could compete with PC5-52 for binding to stimulated HUVECs
(Fig. 4A-d), but the same concentration of mutated peptide,
MP5-52, could not (Fig. 4A-e). Biotin-labeled SP5-52 peptide bound
to tumor vessels of human lung cancer surgical specimens but not
to normal pulmonary vasculature (Fig. 4B, a and c). Anti-CD31
antibody bound both tumor and normal blood vessels (Fig. 4B, b
and d). Sixty percent (6 of 10) of pulmonary adenocarcinomas from
10 patients expressed a target protein recognized by the peptide
(Fig. 4B; Supplementary Fig. S1). PC5-52 binding to human NSCLC
surgical specimens was inhibited by 100 Ag/mL of SP5-52
(Supplementary Fig. S1e and f ). These data indicate that SP5-52
peptide could recognize unidentified receptors on human angiogenic endothelial cells, and on the tumor neovasculature of both
humans and mice.
Animal model for study of ligand-targeted therapy. To
determine whether SP5-52 could be used to improve the efficacy

of cancer chemotherapeutics, we coupled SP5-52 to liposomes
containing the antiangiogenic drug, doxorubicin (SP5-52-Lipo-Dox).
SCID mice bearing a CL1-5 xenograft (tumor size f100 mm3) were
then treated with SP5-52-Lipo-Dox, Lipo-Dox, or PBS. The SP5-52Lipo-Dox–treated mice showed a significantly smaller tumor size
than Lipo-Dox– and PBS–treated cases (P < 0.01; Fig. 5A).
The tumor size of the Lipo-Dox group gradually increased to
1.9-fold larger than that of the SP5-52-Lipo-Dox group by day 28.
The tumor size of the control PBS group was 4.1-fold larger than
that of the SP5-52-Lipo-Dox group (Fig. 5A). The body weights
of each group showed no significant changes (data not shown).
To further characterize therapeutic efficacy, we compared the
animal survival rates after 21 days of treatment. When we stopped
the experiment on day 81, all animals (n = 6) had died in the PBS
and Lipo-Dox groups (0% survival rate), whereas only two animals
had died in the SP5-52-Lipo-Dox group (66.7% survival rate;
Fig. 5B). To verify the antiangiogenic effect of SP5-52-Lipo-Dox,
we repeated the above experiment and removed the tumor
tissues for analysis of the effect on tumor blood vessels. Tumor
vessels were found to be markedly decreased in SP5-52-Lipo-Dox–
treated mice but not in mice of the PBS groups. Lipo-Dox–treated
mice showed a limited reduction in the tumor vasculature
(Supplementary Fig. S2).
To test whether SP5-52 could also increase the therapeutic
efficacy for oral cancer, we administered ligand-targeted therapy
for this cancer in an animal model. SCID mice bearing oral cancer
xenografts were treated with SP5-52-Lipo-Dox, Lipo-Dox, or PBS.
Similar results were found. The SP5-52-Lipo-Dox–treated mice
showed a significantly smaller tumor size than Lipo-Dox and PBStreated mice (P < 0.05; Fig. 5C). The tumor size in the Lipo-Dox

group gradually increased to 3.6-fold larger than that of the SP5-52Lipo-Dox group on day 24.5. Mice in the control PBS group were
found to have a tumor size 7.1-fold larger than that of the SP5-52Lipo-Dox group (Fig. 5C). The body weights of each group showed
no significant changes (data not shown). To further characterize
therapeutic efficacy, we compared animal survival rates after
21 days of treatment. All animals (n = 6) had died in the PBS group
(0% survival rate), four animals had died in the Lipo-Dox group
(33.3% survival rate), whereas all the SP5-52-Lipo-Dox–treated mice
had survived (100% survival rate) when the experiment had
finished on day 60 (Fig. 5D). Repeating this experiment further
confirmed that SP5-52-Lipo-Dox was more effective than Lipo-Dox
in treating oral cancer xenografts, with the tumor size of the LipoDox group gradually increasing to 3.2-fold that of the SP5-52-LipoDox group on day 24.5. The control PBS group had a tumor size
5.9-fold larger than that of the SP5-52-Lipo-Dox group (data not
shown). Thus, conjugation of Lipo-Dox with the targeting ligand
SP5-52 enhances the ability of the drug to inhibit the growth of
solid tumors, including human lung and oral cancer xenografts in
SCID mice.

Discussion
Most cancer chemotherapy is accompanied by strong side effects
and acquired drug resistance. Therefore, there is a pressing need
for drug delivery systems to deliver drugs to target sites on both
tumor vessels and tumor cells. Some attempts have been made,
including the use of antibodies (40) and targeting peptides (33)
against tumor cells. Vascular targeting is also a focus of interest,
because angiogenesis is a required step for tumor expansion, and
drugs or drug carriers may first meet neovasculature before
extravasation in the tumor (41). Because tumor vasculature
expresses unique markers that distinguish it from normal
vasculature (42), targeting to markers of tumor angiogenic
vasculature is a promising strategy for cancer treatment. In this
study, we used in vivo phage display to identify tumor homing
peptides, including SP5-52, which could specifically bind not only
the tumor vessels of xenografts in animal models, but also VEGFstimulated HUVECs and human lung cancer vessels. Such peptides
are useful tools for active targeting to tumor neovasculature.
In vivo biopanning identified phages (such as PC5-52) with high
binding activity to lung cancer xenografts. Phages from the fifth

round showed 156-fold higher affinity than those from the initial
round (Fig. 1A) with several of the phage clones displaying the PSP
consensus peptide motif (Table 1). The binding activity of PC5-52
with tumor tissues could be inhibited by the synthetic peptide,
SP5-52 (Fig. 1B, b and d) indicating that the synthetic peptides
bind the same sites as their respective phage clones. That the
mutated synthetic peptide, MP5-52, could not inhibit PC5-52
binding shows the importance of the PSP motif (Fig. 3B). Moreover,
this phenomenon was observed both in mouse xenograft tumors
and in human-stimulated HUVEC cells (Fig. 4A). Closer examination revealed that PC5-52 phage and SP5-52 peptide colocalized
with CD31 in most xenograft tumor vascular endothelia but were
rarely detected in tumor cells or normal organs (Fig. 2). Our
findings indicate that PC5-52 could specifically target tumor
neovasculature endothelial cells, but not the vasculature of normal
organs, and that the PSP motif is required for this targeting.
IVO-2 and PC5-52 carried the same peptide, and we determined
that the peptide sequence could direct the phages to the
vasculature of xenografts derived from other human tumor cells.
Xenograft tumor tissues from eight different cancer cell lines
contained >8-fold more PC5-52 than normal organs (Figs. 1B and
3A), indicating a higher affinity of PC5-52 for these tumor tissues.
These phenomena suggest that the neovasculature in solid tumors
may universally express an unidentified receptor not expressed in
normal mature vasculature, and that this receptor recognizes the
SP5-52 peptide.
This peptide, selected using the murine angiogenic model,
had the same binding affinity for the neovasculature endothelia
in human tumors, and was able to specifically bind both human
lung cancer biopsy specimens and VEGF-stimulated endothelial cells (HUVECs; Fig. 4). Therefore, the molecular target
may be specifically expressed in angiogenic vessels. This putative
receptor could recognize a peptide ligand with the sequence,

SVSVGMKPSPRP. A Blast search for this 12-mer peptide revealed
PSP motif homologies to seven human sequence entries. However,
although SP5-52 possesses homology with predicted protein
interaction and DNA binding motifs in human proteins, the PSP
motif per se was not identified as a known ligand for membrane
proteins.
Our finding that this peptide targets the neovasculature
indicates a high potential utility in tumor detection and directed
chemotherapeutic drug delivery. Using SP5-52–conjugated LipoDox to compare the effects with nontargeted Lipo-Dox on tumor
growth, we showed that SP5-52-Lipo-Dox enhanced the efficacy of
the drug against human lung and oral cancer xenografts (Fig. 5A
and C). The targeting liposome also significantly increased the
survival rate in these two human cancer xenograft animal models
(Fig. 5B and D). This targeting strategy has significant clinical
potential to improve cancer treatment.
The tumor vasculature is a particularly suitable target for cancer
therapy because it is composed of genetically stable nonmalignant
endothelial cells that induce little or no drug resistance (43). In
addition, these cells are more accessible to drugs and have an
intrinsic amplification mechanism. It has been estimated that
elimination of a single endothelial cell could inhibit the growth of
100 tumor cells (44, 45). The severe damage to tumor vasculature
caused by SP5-52-Lipo-Dox throughout the tumors (Supplementary
Fig. S2) clearly shows an improvement in chemotherapeutic
efficacy in a xenograft animal model. This may be due to an
increased accumulation of targeted liposomes in tumor tissues.
The high tumor interstitial fluid pressure (IFP) of solid tumors is a
barrier to efficient drug delivery (46); increased IFP contributes to
decreased transcapillary transport in tumors, which leads to the
decreased uptake of drugs and eventual failure of therapy. These
phenomena are accompanied by the development of drug
resistance and metastatic disease (46–50). The ligand-targeted

A Peptide for Targeted Drug Delivery to Tumor Blood Vessels

therapy described here may overcome these problems by
increasing the accumulation of drugs in the high IFP of the tumor
through the affinity of the targeting ligand for tumor tissues.
In summary, using in vivo phage display to isolate ligands
homing to molecules on tumor endothelial cells, we identified
several peptides, including SP5-52, which targeted the neovasculature in two NSCLCs and six human tumor xenografts. Targeting
liposomes via this peptide can inhibit the angiogenesis of tumors,
resulting in increased therapeutic efficacy and higher survival rates
of human lung and oral cancer xenograft mice. Therefore, SP5-52 is
an effective agent for drug delivery to the neovasculature of solid
