ABSTRACT
Cisplatin (cDDP) is known to bind to the CXXC motif of proteins containing
a ferrodoxin-like fold but little is known about its ability to interact with other
Cu-binding proteins. MEK1/2 has recently been identified as a Cu-dependent enzyme
that does not contain a CXXC motif. We found that cDDP bound to and inhibited the
activity of recombinant MEK1 with an IC50 of 0.28 μM and MEK1/2 in whole cells with
an IC50 of 37.4 μM. The inhibition of MEK1/2 was relieved by both Cu+1 and Cu+2 in
a concentration-dependent manner. cDDP did not inhibit the upstream pathways
responsible for activating MEK1/2, and did not cause an acute depletion of cellular
Cu that could account for the reduction in MEK1/2 activity. cDDP was found to bind
MEK1/2 in whole cells and the extent of binding was augmented by supplementary
Cu and reduced by Cu chelation. Molecular modeling predicts 3 Cu and cDDP binding
sites and quantum chemistry calculations indicate that cDDP would be expected
to displace Cu from each of these sites. We conclude that, at clinically relevant
concentrations, cDDP binds to and inhibits MEK1/2 and that both the binding and
inhibitory activity are related to its interaction with Cu bound to MEK1/2. This may
provide the basis for useful interactions of cDDP with other drugs that inhibit MAPK
pathway signaling.

the Cu to the CXXC motifs in the Cu efflux transporters
ATP7A and ATP7B, or to the various Cu-dependent
enzymes [4].
The discovery that the major Cu influx transporter
CTR1 modulates the uptake of cDDP [reviewed in [2]]
introduced the concept that cDDP exploits chemical
characteristics that make it similar to Cu+1 to get into the
cell [5]. Both Cu and cDDP are soft Lewis acids and share
the electronic characteristics that allow weak binding to
methionines and to CXXC motifs. The ability of cDDP to
kill cells despite the great excess of GSH in the cytoplasm,
with which it readily reacts, led us to speculate that, as it
does for Cu, the Cu homeostasis system operates to protect
cDDP as well as to distribute it to specific sites within the
cell [5]. This concept depends on the idea that cDDP, like
Cu, can transiently associate with Cu binding proteins
that protect it against reaction with thiols, and that it can
undergo transfer from one such protein to another. Our
studies and those of others have now established that some
of these steps are feasible in extracellular systems. The

INTRODUCTION
Cisplatin (cDDP) is widely used for the treatment
of many types of cancer. It is a polar molecule that does
not readily diffuse across bilayer lipid membranes as
shown by the fact that it remains stably encapsulated in
liposomes [1]. Recent studies have demonstrated that
cDDP influx and efflux are modulated by transporters
and chaperones involved in copper (Cu) homeostasis in
mammalian cells [reviewed in [2]]. Cu is an essential
micronutrient, but because it can readily undergo redox
reactions under intracellular conditions it can generate
reactive oxygen species that can be dangerous to cells.
This threat is managed in mammalian cells by a group of
Cu-binding chaperones and efflux transporters that bind
Cu in CXXC motifs and keep its free concentration to
<10−18 M [3]. Cu entering on the major influx transporter
CTR1 is handed to one of the Cu chaperones ATOX1,
CCS or COX17 and the affinity of the CXXC motifs in
these proteins is such that they can subsequently donate

CXXC motifs in ATOX1 [6–8], and ATP7B [9] bind cDDP,
and ATOX1 can transfer it to the CXXC motif in the second
MBD of ATP7B [8, 10]. It has also been established that a
complex of methionine with cDDP can transfer the cDDP
to the N7 of guanine in DNA [11]. Recent findings indicate
that CTR1 is important to receptor tyrosine kinase signaling
[12–14] and there is evidence that the Cu delivered by
CTR1 is required for SOD1 to generate the H2O2 that limits
receptor phosphatases [14] and for the activity of MEK1
which turns out to be a Cu-dependent enzyme [13, 15].
The ability of cDDP to bind to the CXXC motifs of
the Cu homeostasis proteins raises the question of whether
cDDP can also bind to other types of Cu binding sites found
in Cu-dependent enzymes, or whether it can interfere with
their activity by limiting the transfer of exchangeable Cu
onto the enzymes. Given the importance of MEK1/2 in the
MAPK pathway, and the recent discovery that MEK1/2 is
a Cu-dependent enzyme, we examined the ability of cDDP
to bind and to inhibit MEK1 in both a cell-free system
and in whole cells. We report here that cDDP binds to and
inhibits MEK1 in both settings, and that inhibition is offset
by increasing the availability of Cu.

binding of Cu to MEK1 or the ability of Cu to optimally
configure the structure of the enzyme. To explore this
we tested the ability of cDDP to prevent the thermal
denaturation of recombinant MEK1. We studied the
effect of Cu as well to confirm that MEK1 is a Cu binding
protein and determine whether they both produce the same
pattern of stabilization. As shown in Figure 2A and 2B,
MEK1 had an unusual thermal denaturation curve with
loss of stability at temperatures up to 45°C but some
recovery of stability between 45 and 65°C. The shape
of this curve was similar in each of the 3–5 independent
experiments performed (see also Figure 3A and 3B). A
concentration of 50 μM cDDP increased the stability of
MEK1 at the lower temperatures but had little effect at
the higher temperatures (Figure 2B). Figure 2C shows the
isothermal dose-response fingerprint (ITDRF) for cDDP
in the absence and presence of Cu+1 that indicates that the
stability of recombinant MEK1 increases as a function
of cDDP concentration and that Cu+1 shifts the curve to
the right suggesting an element of antagonism. On the
contrary, Cu+2 shifts the curve to the left indicating that
Cu+2 increases the effect of cDDP on recombinant MEK1
stabilization (Figure 2D). This result suggests a complex
interaction between cDDP and Cu with respect to thermal
stability that depends on the oxidation state of the Cu.
To confirm that cDDP interacts directly with MEK1
a second assay was used in which the ability of the dye
SYPRO orange to bind to hydrophobic portions of MEK1
that become exposed as the temperature is increased was
determined in the presence and absence of cDDP. The data
presented in Figure 2E indicate that cDDP did not alter the
MEK1 melting temperature (Tm) of 45°C but did increase
SYPRO orange binding at all temperatures. This result is
consistent with the conclusion that cDDP interacts directly
with MEK1 to cause exposure of hydrophobic portions
of MEK1 irrespective of temperature. This effect was not
due to an interaction between SYPRO orange and cDDP
(data not shown).
We also examined the effect of both Cu+1, as CuSO4
in the presence of DTT (Figure 3A) and Cu+2, as CuSO4 in
the absence of DTT (Figure 3B) on the thermal stability
of MEK1. Both forms of Cu stabilized MEK1 although
the peak effect of Cu+1 was higher than that of Cu+2.
These data indicate that both reduced and oxidized forms
of Cu can stabilize recombinant MEK1 against thermal
denaturation.

RESULTS
cDDP inhibits the activity of recombinant MEK1
in vitro
MEK1 is an important enzyme in the MAPK pathway
and has recently been identified as a Cu binding protein
although the details of how it binds Cu are unknown. The
effect of Cu and cDDP on the activity of recombinant
MEK was tested by assaying the ability of an active form
of MEK1 to phosphorylate ERK1/2 in the presence of
increasing concentrations of the two compounds. The noncompetitive MEK inhibitor U0126 was used as a positive
control, and the formation of pERK was monitored by
Western blot analysis. As shown in Figure 1A–1C both
cDDP and U0126 inhibited the activity of recombinant
MEK1. The IC50 for cDDP, calculated as the concentration
that reduced activity by half of the maximum inhibition
attainable, was 0.28 ± 0.09 μM whereas for U0126 was 0.21
± 0.11 μM. Figure 1D shows that addition of CuSO4, which
is largely Cu+2, reduced the maximal inhibition attainable by
cDDP in the dose dependent manner, and Figure 1E shows
that increasing concentration of CuSO4 in the presence of
dithiotheitol (DTT) that keeps the Cu reduced to Cu+1 even
more potently shifted the cDDP inhibition curve to the right
suggesting that both forms of Cu modulate the interaction
of cDDP with MEK1.

cDDP inhibits MEK1/2 in whole cells
To determine whether cDDP inhibits the MAPK
pathway in whole cells under basal and oncogene driven
conditions we used 10T1/2 mouse fibroblasts that had
been molecularly engineered to express the avian tumor
virus receptor A so that they could be infected with avian
retroviruses expressing different oncogenes. For this
study we used the parental cells infected with an empty

vector (CTRL) and a subline that had been infected
with a vector expressing an oncogenic human H-Ras
mutant so as to be able to examine the effect of cDDP
on untransformed cells with just basal MAPK activity,
and in isogenic cells with increased MAPK activity that
drives transformation. The ability of each cell line to form
colonies in soft agar was tested to confirm the transformed
phenotype. Supplementary Figure 1A shows that, after an
incubation of 14 days, while the empty vector- infected
CTRL cells formed few colonies, the H-Ras oncogeneexpressing cell line formed a large number of colonies
indicating its acquisition of the cell-autonomous growth
characteristics of transformed cells. To determine the
effect of oncogenic H-Ras expression on sensitivity
to cDDP, the CTRL and H-Ras-expressing cells were
exposed to increasing concentrations of cDDP for 72 h
after which viability was determined using the CCK-8
assay. The concentration-survival curves were completely
superimposable indicating no difference in cDDP
sensitivity (Supplementary Figure 1D). The IC50 for the
CTRL cells was 37.4 ± 2.7 and for the H-Ras expressing
cells it was 39.3 ± 6.7 μM.
The extent to which the mutant H-Ras activated
signaling in the MAPK and PI3K pathway in this model
was determined by quantifying the ratio of phosphorylated
ERK1/2(Thr202/Try204) to total ERK1/2 and the ratio of
pAKT(Ser473) to total AKT. As shown in Supplementary
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Figure 1B, the basal level of pERK1/2 was significantly
increased by 1.6 ± 0.1-fold in H-Ras-expressing cells.
Supplementary Figure 1C shows the same type of analysis
for pAKT and indicates that there was a 2.7 ± 0.2-fold
increase in the H-Ras cells. Thus, in this model the
oncogenic H-Ras constitutively activated both the MAPK
and PI3K pathways in the 10T1/2 cells.
The effect of cDDP and the Cu chelating agent
tetrathiomolybdate (TTM) on the activity of the MAPK
pathway was assayed by quantifying changes in the ratio of
pERK to total ERK1/2 by Western blot analysis following
exposure to increasing concentrations of cDDP for 1 h. Figure
4A and 4B show that cDDP inhibited the phosphorylation of
ERK1/2 with an IC50 of 36.4 ± 4.9 μM in CTRL cells and
an IC50 of 35.2 ± 0.3 μM in the H-Ras cells. The potency of
cDDP was compared to that of TTM. As shown in Figure
4C–4E, in the CTRL cells pERK was reduced to 40 ± 11%
of that in the untreated cells following a 1 h exposure to 30
μM cDDP; in the H-Ras cells the reduction was to 48 ± 7%
of control. In contrast, TTM produced a significant reduction
only in the H-Ras expressing cell line to 45 ± 3% of control.
Thus, while cDDP inhibited the MAPK pathway in both cell
types, Cu chelation was effective only when activity in the
pathway was augmented by oncogenic H-Ras expression.
This effect of TTM is consistent with reports that MEK1/2 is
a Cu-dependent enzyme and that oncogenic transformation
increases dependency on Cu [13, 15].

Cu blocks the effect of cDDP on the MAPK
pathway

To address this point, we tested the ability of Cu to offset
the cDDP-induced reduction in pERK1/2. The cells were
incubated with either 30 uM CuSO4 or with 30 uM cDDP
alone or in combination with Cu for 1 h. Figure 5A shows a
representative Western blot, and Figures 5B and 5C show the
values for the level of pERK1/2 determined from at least 3
independent experiments. Exposure to CuSO4 alone produced

The ability of cDDP to bind to CXXC motifs in
proteins responsible for Cu homeostasis suggested the
possibility that cDDP may limit the availability of Cu to
MEK by interfering with the loading of Cu onto the enzyme.

no effect in the CTRL cells and only a small and statistically
insignificant increase in pERK1/2 level in the H-Ras cells,
whereas cDDP reduced its level in both. CuSO4 reversed
the cDDP-induced reduction in pERK1/2 in both cell types;
in the H-Ras cells it actually increased pERK by 1.6 ± 0.4fold (p = 0.030). Figures 5D and 5E show that the ability
of Cu to reverse the effect of cDDP in the CTRL cells was
concentration-dependent over the range of 5 – 30 uM CuSO4
and that it reached a plateau above 30 uM Cu. The data in
Figure 5F show that the ability of 30 μM to reverse the effect
of cDDP increased in proportion to the degree of inhibition
produced by cDDP and that, under these circumstances,
Cu actually stimulated MEK1/2 activity. These results are
consistent with the concept that inhibition by cDDP can be
reversed by Cu in whole cells, but suggest a complex rather
than simple competitive interaction.
In cells expressing mutant Ras genes ERK1/2 is
activated by phosphorylation primarily by MEK1/2 which
has been identified as a Cu-dependent enzyme [13, 15].
To exclude the possibility that cDDP interferes with the
pathway upstream of MEK1/2, we analyzed the effect of a
1 h exposure to 30 uM cDDP on the activation of MEK1/2
as detected by Western blot analysis using an antibody that
detects the MEK(Ser217/221) phosphorylation. As shown
in Supplementary Figure 2A and 2B, the ratio of pMEK
to total MEK was significantly higher in the H-Ras than
in the CTRL cells. However, cDDP did not reduce pMEK
in either cell type, nor did Cu increase the extent of MEK
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

phosphorylation (Supplementary Figure 2C and 2D). This
finding indicates that cDDP does not impair steps in the
pathway between H-Ras and MEK, that these upstream
steps are not augmented by Cu, and that cDDP reduces
pERK through an effect on the activity of MEK.

cDDP does not acutely reduce intracellular Cu
The ability of excess Cu to antagonize cDDPinduced inhibition of MEK1/2 in whole cells raised the
question of whether cDDP was working by limiting
the access of Cu to the enzyme by reducing the pool
of exchangeable Cu in the whole cell thus limiting
transfer of Cu to the enzyme. To determine whether
cDDP produced an acute reduction in intracellular Cu,
the CTRL and H-Ras-expressing cells were exposed to
either 30 uM cDDP or Cu alone or in combination for
1 h and whole cell Cu content was determined by ICPMS. As shown in Figure 6A and 6B, this concentration
of cDDP had no effect on the basal level of intracellular
Cu, nor did the concurrent addition of cDDP limit the
ability of supplementary CuSO4 to increase cellular Cu
which argues that cDDP did not significantly inhibit Cu
influx. However, this leaves open the question of whether
cDDP reduces the exchangeable pool of Cu or interferes
with the transfer of Cu to MEK1/2. To detect a change
in exchangeable Cu we measured the effect of cDDP on
the level of the Cu chaperone CCS which is a sensitive

measure of the availability of intracellular Cu [16].
cDDP produced a clear time-dependent increase in CCS
in 10T1/2 CTRL and H-Ras cells (Figure 6C and 6D);
however, this evolved slowly over 48 h whereas the same
concentration of cDDP reduced MEK activity within 1 h.
Thus, it appears unlikely that cDDP inhibits MEK1/2 by
abruptly reducing the availability of Cu.
As an independent test of whether cDDP acutely
limits the availability of intracellular Cu we took
advantage of a previous observation that deficiency
of Cu due to the loss of the influx transporter CTR1
impairs signaling from multiple receptor tyrosine kinases
including the insulin/IGF1 receptor [13, 14] . CTRL cells
were exposed to10 nM IGF-1 for 60 min following a 1 h
exposure to 30 μM cDDP or control medium. As shown in
Figure 6E, while cDDP blocked insulin receptor signaling
this was only partially reversed by supplementing the cell
with 30 μM Cu. IGF-1 did not significantly alter the level
of phospho-MEK nor did cDDP reduce it (Figure 6F).
These results provide further evidence against the idea
that cDDP acutely reduces exchangeable Cu sufficiently
to block MEK1/2.
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

If cDDP inhibits MEK1/2 by reducing its access to
Cu, or the ability of bound Cu to configure MEK1 in an
active form, then a form of MEK that does not require Cu
for activity should not be inhibited. The CTRL cells were
engineered to express a Cu-independent form of MEK
consisting of the ERK1/2 binding region of MEK1 fused
to a constitutively active kinase domain of MEK5 (S311D/
T315D) to create MEK1-MEK5DD [15]. Figure 6G shows
that 10T1/2 cells engineered to express either MEK1WT or
MEK1-MEK5DD were more resistant to cDDP than the CTRL
cells infected with empty vector. The IC50 for the CTRL
cells was 21.8 ± 9.6 μM whereas it was 59.5 ± 9.2 μM for
the MEK1WT and 68.6 ± 3.9 μM (p < 0.01 for both) for the
MEK1-MEK5DD-expressing cells indicating that high level
expression of MEK1 by itself can confer 2.7-fold resistance
but that cDDP was equally effective against cells overexpressing either form of the enzyme. This result establishes
that cDDP can inhibit the enzyme activity irrespective of
whether the activity of the kinase activity is Cu-dependent.

cDDP and Cu bind to phospho- and total
MEK1/2 in whole cells

30 uM Cu or 30 uM TTM. Rather than antagonizing the
ability of cDDP to stabilize MEK1/2, Cu augmented this
effect consistent with the earlier observation that Cu was
more effective at enhancing MEK1/2 activity when it
was being inhibited by cDDP. Addition of Cu shifted the
ITDRF to the left, and reduction of intracellular Cu by
chelation with TTM shifted it to the right indicating that,
in whole cells, the ability of cDDP to bind to either form
of MEK1/2 was dependent on the availability of Cu.
Thus, both Cu and cDDP interact with phospho- and total
MEK1/2 in whole cells in a manner that increases their
stability, and the interaction of cDDP with both forms of
MEK1/2 is favored rather than antagonized by Cu.

To determine whether cDDP binds to phosphoand total MEK1/2 in whole cells, and how stability is
influenced by Cu, we evaluated the stability of MEK1/2
in whole cells using the cellular thermal shift assay
(CETSA). The ITDRF curves shown in Figure 7A
and 7B indicate that Cu increases the stability of both
phospho- and total MEK1/2 but only when the medium
was supplemented with sufficient CuSO4 to raise
the total Cu concentration to well above physiologic
levels. cDDP also increased the stability of both forms
of MEK1/2, and it was effective at the concentrations
from 30 to 100 uM at a temperature of 40°C (Figure
7C and 7D). These results provide evidence that both
forms of MEK1/2 bind cDDP and that some binding
is detectable at concentrations close to the IC50. To
determine whether the ability of cDDP to bind to the
two forms of MEK1/2 was influenced by the availability
of Cu, ITDRF curves were constructed for the effect of
increasing concentrations of cDDP in the presence of

site composed of the side chains of a methionine and a
deprotonated cysteine residue (termed prot). The reaction
energy for replacing Cu with cDDP is obtained from:

is quite different from the CXXC motif to which cDDP
is known to bind in ATOX1 [6, 8, 17, 18] and ATP7B
[9, 10, 19]. Not very much is known about the types of
cDDP binding sites in proteins and we hypothesized that
the range of motifs to which cDDP can bind may include
those found in other Cu binding proteins such as MEK1/2.
The results reported here indicate that cDDP
can inhibit MEK1/2 activity at clinically relevant
concentrations. Using ERK1 as a substrate, cDDP was
found to inhibit the activity of a recombinant form
of MEK1 with an IC50 of 0.28 μM and that this was
antagonized by supplementary Cu in the form of either
Cu+1 or Cu+2. Two types of thermal denaturation assays
indicated that, like Cu, cDDP binds to recombinant MEK1.
Studies using parental and H-Ras oncogene-transformed
mouse fibroblasts demonstrated that cDDP reduced the
ratio of pERK1/2 to total ERK1/2 in whole cells, a classic
measure of the activity of the MAPK pathway, and that
this was antagonized by supplementary Cu indicating that
Cu influences cDDP-induced inhibition of MEK1/2 in this
setting as well. Curiously, the ability of Cu to antagonize
cDDP-induced reduction of pERK was greater at higher
levels of inhibition and this resulted in an increase in
MEK1/2 activity to above baseline. This is discussed
further below. The fact that cDDP had no effect on the
ratio of pMEK1/2 to total MEK1/2 suggests that it does
not interfere with the activating phosphorylation of this
enzyme by upstream kinases.

[Cu(prot)(OH2)2](n−1)+ + cis-[Pt(NH3)2(OH2)2]2+ →
[Pt(prot)(NH3)2]+ + [Cu(OH2)4]n+, n = 1 or 2
Calculation of the energies for Cu and Pt (in a cDDP
environment) for these sites indicates that Pt has 12–15
kcal/mol lower (more favorable) energy of binding to the
site than Cu and thus that Cu would be displaced by Pt
(Table 1). The optimized geometries of the models are
depicted in Figure 8.

DISCUSSION
The ability of cDDP to bind to ATOX1 and the metal
binding domains of ATP7B sparked our interest in whether
cDDP could bind to and interfere with the function of
other Cu-binding proteins. MEK1/2 has recently been
identified as a Cu-binding protein [13] whose activity is
compromised when whole cell Cu levels are reduced by
chelation [15]. The Cu-dependency of MEK1/2 becomes
exposed when the MAPK pathway is driven by activating
mutations in BRAF, and under these circumstances
treatment with the Cu chelator TTM reduces the growth
of human melanoma xenografts [15]. Exactly how Cu is
bound in MEK1/2 is not yet clear, but the Cu binding site

The data from the studies of recombinant MEK1
indicate that both oxidized and reduced Cu affects the
ability of cDDP to inhibit the enzyme. One possibility is
that Cu and cDDP compete for the same binding site, but
another is that a conformational change produced by the
binding of cDDP may modulate the loading of Cu onto a
separate binding site and vice versa. Recent studies have
documented that cDDP and Cu can simultaneously bind
to cysteines [18] and that the binding of Cu facilitates the
binding of cDDP and limits its departure to other thiols
such as GSH [20, 21]. Molecular modeling and quantum
chemistry calculations identified 3 predicted Cu and cDDP
binding sites in MEK1 and indicated that cDDP would be
expected to readily displace Cu from all of these sites.
In whole cells the situation is more complex.
Supplementary Cu+2 that is subsequently reduced to Cu+1
before cellular entry enhanced and cDDP inhibited MEK1/2
activity but the fact that cDDP inhibited the activity of
MEK1-MEK5DD as well as wild type MEK1/2 indicates
that its ability to inhibit does not depend on Cu+1 activation
of the kinase. In addition to this type of interaction at the
enzyme itself, in whole cells there is also the possibility
that cDDP interferes with the transfer of Cu+1 to MEK1/2.
It is not currently known how MEK1/2 acquires Cu, but two
lines of evidence argue against the possibility that cDDP
inhibits MEK1/2 by reducing Cu+1 availability in the whole
cell. First, at concentrations that inhibited MEK1/2 activity
cDDP did not produce an acute change in whole cell Cu.
Second, while cDDP reduced IGFR1 signaling this was not
clearly offset by supplementary Cu+2 suggesting it was not
due to reduced Cu availability. It is important to note that
these are both quite insensitive measures of the availability
of intracellular Cu, and that recent studies using fluorescent
sensors detect an exchangeable pool that could potentially be
modulated by cDDP in the absence of a change in whole cell

Cu content [22–25]. Separate from whether cDDP reduces
the concentration of available Cu, cDDP may interfere with
the transfer of Cu+1 from the one or more unknown donors
that provide Cu+1 to MEK1/2. Like Cu, ATOX1 has now
been shown to transfer cDDP to both the second and fourth
metal binding domains of ATP7B [8, 10]. Since cDDP binds
to the same CXXC motif as Cu this suggests that cDDP has
the potential to interfere with Cu transfer reactions involving
these and potentially other Cu binding motifs.
The thermal denaturation studies indicated that
both Cu and cDDP bind to recombinant MEK1 and that
both stabilize MEK1/2 in whole cells. In each setting
the binding was influenced by the availability of Cu.
Additional Cu+2 enhanced rather than hindered the ability
of cDDP to protect MEK1/2 from thermal denaturation
in whole cells whereas reducing the availability of
intracellular Cu by chelating it with TTM reduced the
ability of cDDP to stabilize MEK1/2, thus documenting
that this was a direct effect of Cu. This suggests a model in
which the Cu and cDDP bind to different sites, and that the
conformational shift that probably occurs when MEK1/2
binds Cu actually assists cDDP to stabilize the protein.
Stated another way, the conformational shift produced
when both metals are bound may result in greater stability
than can be achieved by either alone. There is already
some evidence that Cu and cDDP can co-occupy the same
CXXC motif in the Cu chaperone ATOX1 [8] which hints
at the potential of these metals to interact in a complex
manner at other types of Cu binding sites. This would
provide an explanation for the observation that, while
cDDP alone inhibits MEK1/2 activity in whole cells,
the addition of Cu+2 not only restores activity it actually
increases it substantially. We speculate that the sum of the
changes induced by each metal results in a conformation
whose activity or ability to bind substrate is even greater

than that of the protein when loaded only with Cu. While
it is pMEK1/2 that has the bulk of the enzymatic activity,
it is noteworthy the cDDP stabilized both pMEK and
total MEK to the same degree. Whatever change cDDP
produces in MEK1/2 it does not perturb the relative
amount of pMEK indicating that the cDDP does not limit
the activating phosphorylation which in turn suggests that
it does not hinder the ability of upstream kinases to access
the MEK1/2.
The discovery that cDDP inhibits MEK1/2 in
whole cells at clinically relevant concentrations begs the
question of whether this effect contributes importantly to
the cytotoxic potential of cDDP or whether the extensive
DNA damage done by this drug dwarfs any pro-apoptotic
contribution made by impairment of signaling in the MAPK
pathway. Synergy between small molecule inhibitors of
the MAPK pathway and cDDP has been reported in nonclinical studies [26, 27] pointing to the possible enhanced
efficacy of cDDP and MEK1/2 inhibitors in patients.
However, while such synergy could reflect independent
inhibition of MEK1/2 by each drug independently, it could
also result from inability of the inhibited MAPK pathway
to fully participate in the anti-apoptotic cellular injury
response triggered by DNA damage. In any case, it is
noteworthy that cDDP was effective at inhibiting MEK1/2
both in the parental cells and when the MAPK pathway was
being driven hard by an oncogenic H-Ras.

six-well plates with a 0.6% agarose underlay. About 1.0 ml
growth medium was added on the top of agarose and the
medium was changed every 3–4 days, and incubated in 5%
CO2 in air at 37°C for 14 days. At the end of incubation, the
cells were washed with PBS and incubated in a solution of
0.005% crystal violet for 60 min and then rinsed with water.
Then, the number of colonies were counted.

CCK-8 assay
10T1/2 CTRL and H-Ras cells (1×103 cells/well
in 96-well culture plates) were treated with 0.1% DMSO
or different concentration of cDDP (3, 10, 15, 20, 30
and 50 uM) for 72 h after which 5 ul of CCK-8 solution
was added to each well and incubated for 4 h at 37°C.
Absorbance was measured at 450 nm on a microplate
reader (VERSAmax, Moleuclar Devices, Sunnyvale,
CA). The cell viability (%) was calculated relative to the
control from the mean of pooled data from 3 independent
experiments with 6 wells for each drug concentration.

Western blotting
Cells were dissolved RIPA lysis buffer containing
protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Thermo
scientific, Lorgan, UT) for 30 min. The lysates were
centrifuged at 14100g for 10 minutes at 4°C. The resulting
supernatant was subjected to protein content determination
using a detergent-compatible protein assay kit, DCTM
Protein Assay (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Thirty microgram of
total protein were loaded onto 4 to 15% SDS-polyacrylamide
gels and electrotransferred to Immobilon PVDF membrane
(Millipore, Billerica, MA). Blots were incubated over night at
4°C in primary antibody at 1:1000 dilution. These were then
rinsed 3 times in TBS-T (0.1% Tween) and incubated with
the appropriate Li-Cor secondary antibodies conjugated with
680LT or 800CW infrared dyes (Li-Cor Biosciences, Lincoln,
NE). Sources of antibodies were as follows: monoclonal
antibodies against total p44/42 MAPK (ERK1/2),
MEK1 (1:2000 dilution), polyclonal antibodies against
phospho-p44/42 (pERK1/2), (Thr202/Tyr204), phosphoMEK1/2 (Ser217/221), anti-alpha-tubulin (Cell Signaling,
Boston, MA), anti-CCS (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas,
TX). The blots were visualized and quantified using a Li-Cor
Odyssey Imager (Li-Cor Bioscience, Lincoln, NE).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Drug and reagents
All chemicals and solvents were purchased from
Cell Signaling Technologies (Danvers, MA). cDDP
was purchased from Teva Parenteral Medicines, Inc
(Irvine, CA). Ammonium tetrathiomolybdate (TTM) was
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO).

Cell culture
The wild type 10T1/2 cells (CTRL) and sublines
transformed with H-Ras oncogenes were kindly provided
by Dr. Peter Vogt (Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla,
CA). Cells were cultured DMEM high-glucose media
(Thermo scientific, Waltham, MA) supplemented with 10%
FBS, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 μg/mL streptomycin
(Mediatech, Inc. Manassas, VA) in 5% CO2 in air at 37°C.
In experiments where medium was supplemented with Cu
the source of the Cu was CuSO4 either alone, identified as
Cu+2, or in combination with 5-fold excess of DTT relative
to the protein concentration, identified as Cu+1.

Intracellular Cu measurement
For measurement of intracellular 63Cu accumulation,
10T1/2tva cells were plated at 7.5 × 105 cells/well into 6 well
plates in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum. An extra
plate of 6 cultures was prepared for measurement of protein
concentration. 10T1/2 CTRL and H-Ras cells were treated
with 30 μM cDDP or TTM for 1 h and then washed 3 times
with ice-cold PBS. The protein content of replicate cultures
was measured using the detergent-compatible DCTM Protein
Assay (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Treated cells were lysed with

Soft-agar colony formation assay
10T1/2 CTRL and H-Ras cells were removed from
culture plates with trypsin and were plated at 2 × 103 cells

protein was 2 uM. Twenty five uL of reaction mixture
was transferred to Fast Optical 96 Well Reaction Plate
(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and kept on ice.
The plate was sealed with Optical Adhesive Film (Applied
Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and centrifuged at 500 g
for 2 min to remove air bubbles. Fluorescence intensity
was measured over the temperature range starting from
10 to 90°C (0.02°C /sec) using a ViiA™ 7 Real-Time
PCR System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) with
an appropriate filter. The melting temperature (Tm) was
calculated on normalized data using a Boltzmann sigmoid
equation as previously described. [29]

214 μl of 70% nitric acid and incubated at room temperature
overnight followed by heating to 65°C for an additional
16 h. The resulting cell lysates were diluted with 6 ml
of buffer for ICP-MS containing 0.1% Triton-X, 1% nitric
acid and 1 ppb indium. Cu concentrations were measured
using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry
(ICP-MS). The Cu content was normalized to protein content.

Cellular thermal shift assay (CETSA)
The ability of cDDP to bind to and stabilize MEK
against thermal denaturation in whole cells, and as a
recombinant protein, was tested using the cellular thermal
shift assay as described previously [28]. In brief, 10T1/2
CTRL cells were seeded in 15cm cell culture plates and
exposed to 30 uM cDDP. After a 1 h exposure, the cells
were washed with PBS and suspended in PBS containing
complete protease inhibitor cocktail. These aliquots were
heated individually at different temperatures for 3 min
followed by cooling at room temperature for 3 min.
The cells were then dissolved using RIPA buffer and the
lysates were analyzed by Western blotting. Alpha-tubulin
levels were used to normalize the band intensity. The
interaction of cDDP with human recombinant MEK1
(Enzo Life Science, Farmingdale, NY) was also tested
by CETSA. Fifty ng of recombinant MEK1 was treated
with 30 uM cDDP for 30 min at 30°C and aliquots were
then heated individually at various temperatures for 3 min
followed by cooling at room temperature for 3 min and
analyzed by Western blotting. For both types of CETSA
the band intensities in the heated samples were related to
the intensity of the lowest temperature.
To evaluate the drug concentration effect, isothermal
dose-response procedure was performed. 10T1/2 CTRL
cells were treated with variety concentration of cDDP for
1 hr. Then cells were heated at 40°C for 3 min followed by
3 min cooling at room temperature. The levels of phosphoand total ERK or MEK in cell lysates were measured by
western blotting. For the recombinant protein, 50 ng of
recombinant MEK were treated with variety concentration
of cDDP or Cu at 30°C for 30 min. Then these were heated
at 45°C for 3min followed by 3 min cooling at room
temperature. The existences of MEK were measured by
western blotting. The band intensities were related to the
sample treated with 100 uM cDDP as a control. And these
data were fitted using a nonlinear regression curve fit
(Bolzmann sigmoidal).

MEK activity assay
The effect of cDDP on the activity of activated
recombinant MEK1 was evaluated using MAPK1
(ERK2) (Life technologies, Carlsbad, CA) as a substrate.
Human recombinant MEK1 was exposed to increasing
concentrations of cDDP or the MEK inhibitor U0126 (Cell
Signaling, Boston, MA) for 30 min at 30°C following
which human recombinant MAPK1 (ERK2) was added
for an additional 30 min at 30°C. The levels of total
and phospho-ERK were measured by Western blotting.
Relative band intensities of phospho and total ERK were
used as a measure of MEK activity, and change in the ratio
of these band intensities was taken as an indication of
altered MEK activity. In all cases data on band intensities
were normalized to the ratio in the CTRL cells.

Plasmids and plasmid engineering
pBABEpuro-HA-MEK1-MEK5DD and pWZLblastiHA-MEK1-MEK5DD (S311D/T315D; DD) were kind
gift from Drs. Donita Brady and Christopher Counter
(Department of Pharmacology and Cancer Biology, Duke
University Medical Center, Durham, NC). pWZLblastiHA-MEK1WT was obtained from Addgene (Cambridge,
MA). 10T1/2 CTRL cells were infected with MuLV
retrovirus pUMVC3 (Addgene, Cambridge, MA) prepared
from these vectors according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. Expression of wild type and MEK1-MEK5DD
was confirmed by Western blot analysis using an antibody
to the HA tag.

Quantum chemistry calculations
Our calculations are based on the crystal structure
of MEK1 (pdb ID 3eqd). The positions of either the Cα
or the Cα and Cβ atoms of the protein side chains were
constrained to their positions in the crystal structure to
mimic a protein environment that is flexible or rigid. All
calculations were performed with the ADF software (http://
www.scm.com) [30] package using density functional
theory with the B3LYP exchange-correlation functional
and a triple-zeta basis set of Slater type functions with
polarization functions and frozen core approximation

Differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF)
SYPRO orange dye 5000x (Sigma-Aldrich, St.
Louis, MO, USA) was dissolved in DMSO at 10% (v/v)
and kept at −80°C. Prior to use, the dye stock was diluted
1:4 in water. Recombinant MEK1 protein was diluted
in MES (2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid) buffer
(10 mM, pH 7.0) and 100x SYPRO orange dye was
added as 10% (v/v) such that the final concentration of
