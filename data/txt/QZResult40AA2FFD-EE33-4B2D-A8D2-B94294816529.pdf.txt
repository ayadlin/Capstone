Abstract
Several cytokines and growth factors that stimulate the
proliferation of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) cells
transduce their signals by activating the transcription factor
Janus-activated kinase 2 (JAK2). Accordingly, the inhibition of
JAK2 or of its downstream signaling pathways suppresses
the proliferation of AML cells. Because (E)-3(6-bromopyridin2-yl)-2-cyano-N-((S0-1-phenylethyl)acrylamide) (WP1066) is a
novel analogue of the JAK2 inhibitor AG490, we tested its
activity in AML cells and investigated its mechanism of action.
Using clonogenic assays, we found that although WP1066 had
a marginal effect on normal marrow progenitors, it inhibited
the proliferation of AML colony-forming cells obtained
from patients with newly diagnosed AML and that of the
AML cell lines OCIM2 and K562. WP1066 inhibited OCIM2 cell
multiplication by inducing accumulation of cells at the G0-G1
phase of the cell cycle. Similar to its parent compound AG490,
WP1066 inhibited the phosphorylation of JAK2, but unlike
AG490, WP1066 also degraded JAK2 protein, thereby blocking
its downstream signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) and phosphoinositide-3-kinase pathways. These
effects resulted in the activation of the caspase pathway.
Incubation of both OCIM2 and K562 cells with WP1066
activated caspase-3, induced cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose)
polymerase, and caused caspase-dependent apoptotic cell
death. Thus, WP1066 is a potent JAK2 inhibitor whose effects
in AML and other hematologic malignancies merit further
investigation. [Cancer Res 2007;67(23):11291–9]

Introduction
Acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) is the most common acute
leukemia in adults. Despite the availability of numerous cytotoxic
drug combinations for leukemia and the ongoing development of
novel antileukemic agents, disease recurrence is common, and
most patients will die of their disease, indicating a need for novel
treatment strategies (1, 2). In recent years, researchers have begun
studying a new generation of antineoplastic agents called signal
transduction inhibitors in clinical trials. These drugs target growth
factor- and cytokine-activated signal transduction pathways,
thereby disrupting extracellular and intracellular signals that
stimulate proliferation and provide these cells with a survival
advantage.

Upon binding to their cellular receptors, hematopoietic growth
factors and cytokines activate Janus-activated kinase ( JAK)
proteins. The JAK proteins are a family of four cytosolic tyrosine
kinases (JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, and TYK2). Once activated, JAKs
phosphorylate and activate cellular cytokine receptors and
signaling molecules such as those regulated by the Src kinase
cascade, the ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K), and signal transducer and activator
of transcription (STAT; ref. 3). Specifically, JAK2 modulates
leukemia-cell survival and proliferation and plays a major role
in the pathogenesis of AML and other hematologic malignancies.
For example, in AML cells bearing the translocation t(9;12), the
oligomerization domain of the TEL gene combines with the
catalytic domain of JAK2 and incites the leukemogenic process
(4, 5). In myeloproliferative disorders and a subset of AML, a
mutation enacting constitutive activation of JAK2 instigates
leukemogenesis (6). In patients with AML, constitutive activation
of either STAT or PI3K (the pathways that are activated by JAK2)
carries a poor prognosis (7, 8). Therefore, inhibition of JAK2 should
be a beneficial strategy for the treatment of AML (9).
In recent years, investigators studied the activity of several
tyrosine phosphorylation inhibitors, called tyrphostins (10–12).
Although one of those, the JAK2 inhibitor AG490, has been
extensively studied, it has not been developed for clinical use.
Therefore, researchers have synthesized several AG490 derivatives
and tested their activity (9–13). In the present study, we
investigated a novel AG490 analogue, (E)-3(6-bromopyridin-2-yl)2-cyano-N-((S0-1-phenylethyl)acrylamide) (WP1066), whose solubility and protein kinase-inhibitory profile suggested that this
compound might be a good candidate for clinical development. We
found that WP1066 inhibits JAK2 and its downstream STAT and
PI3K pathways and induces caspase-dependent apoptosis of AML
cells.

Materials and Methods
Drugs. WP1066 (MW 356.22) was synthesized by Wlademar Priebe at the
University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center and stored as a
lyophilized powder. The lyophilized form of the drug was dissolved in 1%
DMSO, diluted with a 5% dextrose solution, and stored at 20jC. The
stored solution was diluted in tissue culture medium before use. The
structure of WP1066 is shown in Fig. 1A.
Patient samples. Fresh bone marrow (BM) samples were obtained from
four patients with AML at the University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer
Center and three healthy volunteers (controls). The characteristics of
the patients with AML are shown in Table 1. All studies were done after the
M. D. Anderson Cancer Center Institutional Review Board approved the
study and after the subjects gave their written informed consent to
participate.
Cell lines. The AML cell lines OCIM2 and OCI/AML3 were provided by
M.D. Minden (Ontario Cancer Institute, Toronto, Ontario, Canada; refs. 14, 15),

Figure 1. Structure of WP1066 and its effect on the proliferation of AML cells and normal BM colony-forming cells. A, structure of WP1066 [(E)-3(6-bromopyridin-2-yl)2-cyano-N -((S0-1-phenylethyl)acrylamide)] (bottom ) and its parent compound AG490 [2-cyano-3-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-N-(benzyl)-2-propenamide; 2-cyano-3(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-N -(phenylmethyl)-2-propenamide] (top ). B, effect of WP1066 on primary AML cells. AML cells obtained from the four patients with AML were
cultured using the AML blast colony culture assay with or without WP1066 at concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 3.0 Amol/L. Each data point represents the mean colony
number in duplicate or triplicate cultures. The mean number of colonies in the control (WP1066-untreated) cultures was 506 for patient 1, 379 for patient 2, 412
for patient 3, and 720 for patient 4. C, effect of WP1066 on normal marrow progenitors. BFU-Es and CFU-GMs obtained from the three healthy volunteers were
grown using the mixed colony culture assay with or without WP1066 at concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 3.0 Amol/L. Each data point represents the mean colony
number in duplicate or triplicate cultures. The mean number of BFU-Es and CFU-GMs in the control (WP1066-untreated) cultures was 10 and 29, respectively,
for volunteer 1; 143 and 402, respectively, for volunteer 2; and 40 and 100, respectively, for volunteer 3. D, effect of WP1066 on the proliferation of AML cell lines.
AML cells at the peak of their growth were incubated with WP1066, and their proliferation rate was analyzed using a clonogenic assay. Two identical experiments with
each cell line are depicted. The data are presented as the percentages of the numbers of colonies in the control (WP1066-untreated) cultures. The mean numbers
of colonies in the control cultures of CMK cells were 273 and 306, the mean in those of HL60 cells were 412 and 452, the mean in those of KG1 cells were 340 and 368,
the mean in those of OCI/AML3 cells were 537 and 586, the mean in those of OCIM2 cells were 436 and 415, the mean in those of K562 cells were 408 and 390,
and the mean in those of HEL cells were 251 and 286.

and the AML cell lines HL60 and KG1 and the JAK2 V617F-positive
erythroleukemia HEL cells were obtained from the American Type Culture
Collection. Cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 (Life Technologies)
supplemented with 10% FCS (Flow Laboratories), grown in plastic tissue
culture flasks (Falcon Plastics; Becton Dickinson), and split twice weekly.
Also, the human BCR-Abl–expressing Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)–
positive AML cell line K562 was obtained from ATCC, and the human
megakaryocytic leukemia cell line CMK, carrying a mutation of the JAK3
pseudokinase domain, was obtained from the German Collection of
Microorganisms and Cell Cultures (DSMZ GmnH). The cells were grown in
RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FCS in plastic tissue culture flasks
(Falcon Plastics) and split twice weekly.

AML blast colony assay. The AML blast colony assay was done as
described previously (16). Briefly, 1  105 nonadherent T-cell–depleted BM
cells were plated in 0.8% methylcellulose (Fluka Chemical) in a medium
(Life Technologies), supplemented with 10% FCS and 50 ng/mL recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF;
Immunex Corporation) and incubated in 35-mm Petri dishes (Nunc) in
duplicate for 7 days at 37jC in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air.
WP1066 was diluted in isotonic 5% dextrose solution and added to the
culture mixtures at the initiation of the cultures at concentrations of 0.5, 1.0,
2.0, and 3.0 Amol/L. The cultures were microscopically evaluated on day 7 of
the culture. A blast colony was defined as a cluster of at least 40 cells.
Individual colonies were microaspirated, smeared on glass slides, and

stained to confirm their leukemic cell composition. The ability of this assay
to identify AML blast colony cells rather than normal hematopoietic
progenitor cells was previously confirmed by cytogenetic analysis of such
colonies (17).
Erythroid blast-forming unit and colony-forming unit-GM colony
culture assay. The erythroid blast-forming unit (BFU-E) colony assay and
the granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming unit (CFU-GM) clonogenic
assay were done as described previously (18). Briefly, 2  105 BM cells were
cultured in 0.8% methylcellulose in Iscove’s modified Dulbecco’s medium
(Life Technologies) supplemented with 10% FCS, 1.0 unit/mL human
erythropoietin (Amgen), and 50 ng/mL recombinant human GM-CSF
(Immunex Corporation) in the presence or absence of WP1066. One
milliliter of the culture mixture was placed in 35-mm Petri dishes in
duplicate and incubated at 37jC in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in
air. All cultures were evaluated after 14 days for the number of BFU-Es,
defined as an aggregate of more than 500 hemoglobinized cells or three or
more erythroid subcolonies, and for the number of CFU-GM, defined as
clusters of more than 50 granulocytes and/or monocyte/macrophage cells.
Cell line clonogenic assay. The cell line clonogenic assay was done
as described previously (19). Briefly, OCIM2 and K562 cells (2–4  104
cells/mL) were cultured in 0.8% methylcellulose and RPMI 1640 (Life
Technologies) supplemented with 10% FCS in the presence of WP1066 at
concentrations of 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0 Amol/L. The culture mixtures were
placed in 35-mm Petri dishes in triplicate and maintained at 37jC in a
humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air. Colonies were counted after 7 days
by using an inverted microscope. A colony was defined as a cluster of more
than 40 cells.
Western immunoblotting. Cell lysates were assayed for their protein
concentrations using the BCA protein assay reagent (Pierce Chemical).
Each set of paired lysate samples was adjusted for the same protein
concentration. SDS-PAGE was then conducted at a constant wattage
(10 W) in running buffer cooled to 4jC (19). The stacking gels contained 4%
(wt/vol) acrylamide, and the separating gels contained 12% (wt/vol)
acrylamide. Approximately 50 Ag of sample protein was loaded into each
of the appropriate lanes. Proteins separated by electrophoresis were
transferred to nitrocellulose membranes; the transfers were done overnight
at 30 V in a cooled (4jC) reservoir containing 25 mmol/L Tris, 192 mmol/L
glycine, and 20% methanol (pH, 8.3) transfer buffer. The nitrocellulose
membranes were then removed from the blot apparatus and placed in a
Ponceau S staining solution (0.5% Ponceau S and 1% glacial acetic acid in
water) to verify equal loading of protein in the control and treated samples
(20–23). After the membranes were stained for 5 min, they were rinsed for
2 min and examined. Equal loading of protein was verified, and the
membranes were rinsed for an additional 10 min and immunoscreened. The
membranes were blocked with Blotto (5% dried milk dissolved in 50 mL of
PBS) for at least 1 h at room temperature. They were then washed thrice
in PBS plus 0.5% Tween 20. Next, the membranes were incubated for 1 to
12 h with the appropriate antibodies (described below). After incubation,
the membranes were rinsed thrice in PBS containing 0.5% Tween 20 for
15 min each. The bound antibody was detected using the ECL Western
Blotting Detection System (Amersham). Chemiluminescence of the
membranes was detected using X-OMAT AR5 X-ray film (Kodak) in
stainless-steel exposure cassettes (Sigma Chemical Co.). Protein levels were

scored using densitometry with the UltraScan XL laser densitometer
(Pharmacia). Results were normalized by dividing the numerical value of
each sample signal by the numerical value of the signal from the
corresponding value of the h-actin that served as a control.
The following antibodies were used to detect the specified proteins:
mouse antihuman JAK1, TYK2 and phosphorylated (p) CrkL (Becton
Dickinson Transduction Laboratories), rabbit antihuman CrkL, JAK2, JAK3,
pJAK1 (p-Tyr1022/1023), and pJAK2 (p-Tyr1007/1008; Upstate Cell Signaling
Solutions); rabbit antihuman pJAK3 (p-Tyr980; Santa Cruz Biotechnology),
rabbit antihuman pTYK2 (p-Tyr1054/1055; Cell Signaling Technologies),
mouse antihuman STAT3, STAT5, pSTAT3 (pTyr705), and pSTAT5 (pTyr694)
antibodies (Upstate); mouse antiphosphorylated AKT (p-Ser472/473), nonphosphorylated AKT, and mouse antihuman poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase
(PARP; PharMingen); and monoclonal mouse antihuman CPP32 and mouse
antihuman cleaved caspase-3 (New England BioLabs) against procaspase-3
and caspase-3. Normal mouse immunoglobulin G (IgG) and rabbit IgG
(Sigma Chemical Co.) were used as controls. To confirm the detection of
these proteins, lysates of Jurkat cells (ATCC; for the detection of JAK1,
STAT3, STAT5, pSTAT3, pSTAT5, procaspase-3, and PARP proteins), HeLa
cells (ATCC; for the detection of cleaved caspase-3 and pTYK2), human
endothelial cells ( for the detection of TYK2), TF1 cells (ATCC; for the
detection of JAK3) and NIH/3T3 cells treated with platelet-derived growth
factor (PharMingen) were used for the detection of phosphorylated AKT.
Reverse transcription-PCR. Total RNA was extracted using TRI reagent
(Sigma Chemical Co.). The RNA was resuspended in RNase-free water
and frozen at 80jC in 5-Ag aliquots until use. Reverse transcription-PCR
(RT-PCR) was done using the Reverse Transcription System (Promega).
Briefly, the aliquots of RNA were heated to 70jC for 10 min and then placed
on ice. While the RNA was incubating, a 20-AL reaction mixture was
prepared containing 5 mmol/L MgCl2, 1 transcription buffer [10 mmol/L
tris[hydroxymethyl]aminomethane-HCl (pH, 9.0 at 25jC), 50 mmol/L KCl,
0.1% Triton X-100], 1 mmol/L each deoxynucleotide triphosphate (dNTP),
1 unit/AL recombinant RNasin RNase inhibitor, 15 units/Ag avian
myeloblastosis virus (AMV) transcriptase, and 0.5 Ag of random primers.
The mixture was added to the RNA aliquot along with sufficient amount of
RNase-free water for a final volume of 20 AL. The reaction mixture was
incubated at 42jC for 1 h and then heated to 95jC for 5 min and held at
4jC for 5 min to inactivate the AMV transcriptase. The ssDNA was then
amplified. Briefly, a 10-AL aliquot of the ssDNA was added to a reaction
mixture containing 200 Amol/L dNTPs, 2 mmol/L MgCl2, 1 transcription
buffer (described above), and 2.5 units of Taq DNA polymerase. Specific
probes for JAK2 ( forward, GGGTTTCCTCAGAACGTTGA; reverse,
TCATTGCTTTCCTTTTTCACAA) were added along with nuclease-free
water for a final reaction volume of 100 AL. The reaction mixture was
amplified using a Techne Thermal Cycler (Techne Incorporated) for
40 cycles and then amplified at 95jC for 30 s, 55jC for 30 s, and 72jC for
30 s. PCR products were detected on 2% agarose E-Gel gels (Invitrogen)
containing ethidium bromide. The gels were visualized using a FluorChem
8900 imager (Alpha Innotech Corporation).
Cell cycle analysis. Cell cycle analysis was done according to standard
protocols. Briefly, 5  106 cells were pelleted after being incubated with
WP1066. The cell pellets were washed and resuspended in 2 mL of 1%
paraformaldehyde in PBS. Cells were incubated with or without WP1066
for 15 min at 4jC and then washed in PBS, resuspended in 2 mL of
absolute ethanol, and stored at 20jC until they were needed for staining.
The stored cells were then washed twice in PBS, resuspended in 0.5 mL
of propidium iodide staining buffer (50 Ag/mL propidium iodide and
10 Ag/mL RNase in PBS), and incubated for 1 h at room temperature in total
darkness. Flow-cytometric analysis was done using a FACSCalibur flow
cytometer and the CellQuest software program (Becton Dickinson
Immunocytometry Systems). Data analysis was done using the CellQuest
and ModFit LT (version 2.0; Verity Software House) software programs.
Annexin V assay for detection of apoptosis. To quantify the cells
undergoing apoptosis, the annexin V–FITC assay (PharMingen) was used
as described previously (24). Briefly, WP1066-treated OCIM2 and K562
cells were washed twice with cold PBS and then resuspended in binding
buffer [10 nmol/L N-(2-hydroxyethylpiperazine)-N¶-2-ethanesulfonic acid,

software programs. To determine whether WP1066-induced apoptosis was
caspase dependent, OCIM2 cells were preincubated with 20 AL of the pancaspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK (refs. 25, 26; PharMingen), and apoptotic
cells were detected using the annexin V assay as described above.

Results
WP1066 inhibits AML blast colony-forming cell proliferation. To test our hypothesis, we first asked whether WP1066 would
inhibit the proliferation of fresh AML progenitors obtained from
patients. To answer this question, we obtained BM cells from the
four patients with AML and studied the effects of WP1066 on AML
blast colony-forming cells using the AML blast colony assay. We
found that in spite of the significant patient heterogeneity, WP1066
inhibited the proliferation of AML blast colony-forming cells in a
dose-dependent manner at concentrations ranging from 0.5 to
3.0 Amol/L (Fig. 1B). AML blast proliferation was completely
abolished at concentrations >3 Amol/L.
WP1066 suppresses normal BM progenitor proliferation at
increased concentrations. We next asked whether WP1066
selectively inhibits AML blast colony-forming cell proliferation
or it also suppresses normal hematopoietic progenitor growth. We
incubated BM cells obtained from the three healthy volunteers
with WP1066 at concentrations of 0.5 to 3.0 Amol/L. We found that
WP1066 inhibited the growth of normal BM BFU-E and CFU-GM
progenitors at concentrations significantly higher than those
required to inhibit the proliferation of AML progenitors. For
example, at 2 Amol/L, WP1066 completely abolished AML blast
colony growth, whereas it suppressed normal BM BFU-E growth by

only an average of 22% and CFU-GM growth by only an average of
30% (Fig. 1C).
WP1066 inhibits AML colony-forming cell proliferation. We
then sought to investigate the mechanism of action of WP1066. To
do so, we first studied the effects of WP1066 on the proliferation of
several AML cell lines. We found that the most sensitive lines were
HEL cells that carry the JAK2 V617F mutation and OCIM2 and
K562 cells in whom JAK2 is constitutively phosphorylated. WP1066
suppressed the colony-forming capacity of these cell types in a
dose-dependent manner at concentrations ranging from 0.5 to
3.0 Amol/L with complete inhibition of colony formation at a
concentration of 3.0 Amol/L. Notably, WP1066 did not inhibit the
proliferation of the JAK3-dependent megakaryocytic leukemia
CMK cells (Fig. 1D).
WP1066 degrades JAK2 protein. Next, we tested the effect of
WP1066 on the levels of JAK2 protein in these AML cells.
Specifically, we incubated OCIM2 and K562 cells with 0.5, 1.0, 2.0,
3.0, or 4.0 Amol/L WP1066 for 2 h and measured JAK2 and pJAK2
protein levels using Western immunoblotting. We found that
WP1066 down-regulated the protein levels of both JAK2 and its
phosphorylated form in a dose-dependent fashion (Fig. 2A, left). We
then incubated the cells with 2 Amol/L WP1066 for 1, 2, 3, 4, or
6 h and found that WP1066 down-regulated JAK2 protein levels in a
time-dependent manner in K562 cells, whereas in OCIM2 cells,
WP1066 down-regulated only pJAK2 (Fig. 2A, right), suggesting that
WP1066 induces both degradation of JAK2 protein and inhibition
of its phosphorylation. We then studied the effect of WP1066 on
JAK2 expression. We measured JAK2 mRNA expression using
RT-PCR with both forward and reverse JAK2 primer sequences. We

found no significant changes in mRNA expression levels in
either K562 or OCIM2 cells after exposure to 3 Amol/L WP1066
for 4 h (Fig. 2B). These data suggested that in addition to inhibiting
JAK2 phosphorylation, WP1066 degrades JAK2 protein. To test
whether this effect is specific to JAK2, we incubated OCIM2 and
K562 cells with 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, or 4.0 Amol/L WP1066 for 2 h and
measured the protein levels of JAK1, JAK3, TYK2, and their
phosphorylated forms using Western immunoblotting. As shown in
Fig. 2C, we found that incubation of K562 cells with 3.0 and
4.0 Amol/L WP1066 resulted in the down-regulation of JAK3 protein
levels. A similar exposure of OCIM2 cells to WP1066 did not affect
JAK3 and pJAK3 protein levels. Furthermore, incubation with
WP1066 did not induce any significant change either in the levels
of JAK1, TYK2, or their phosphorylated forms, suggesting that
WP1066 specifically reduces the protein levels of JAK2 in OCIM2
cells and of both JAK2 and JAK3 in K562 cells. To further delineate
the effect of WP1066 on JAK3 protein levels, we incubated the
JAK3-dependent megakaryocytic leukemia CMK cells with 0.5, 1.0,
2.0, 3.0, or 4.0 Amol/L WP1066 for 2 h and measured the levels of
JAK3 and pJAK3 by Western immunoblotting. We found that
WP1066 did not affect the protein levels of JAK3 and pJAK3 of CMK
cells (Fig. 2D).
WP1066 inhibits the phosphorylation of STAT3, STAT5, and
AKT. JAK2 phosphorylates both STAT3 and STAT5, prompting
the translocation of these transcription factors to the nucleus. To
determine whether WP1066 inhibits this downstream effect, we
incubated OCIM2 and K562 cells with WP1066 at increasing
concentrations. We found that WP1066 inhibited the phosphorylation of STAT3 and STAT5 in a dose-dependent manner. Incubation
of OCIM2 and K562 cells with WP1066 at a concentration of 0.5,
1.0, 2.0, 3.0, or 4.0 Amol/L for 2 h resulted in significant down-

regulation of constitutive STAT3 and STAT5 phosphorylation in
both cell lines (Fig. 3A). Because JAK2 also activates the PI3K/AKT
pathway, we sought to determine whether WP1066 suppresses
phosphorylation of AKT. We found that, similar to STAT3 and
STAT5, AKT was constitutively activated in both OCIM2 and K562
cells, and that incubation of these cells with 0.5 to 4.0 Amol/L
WP1066 for 2 h inhibited the phosphorylation of AKT (Fig. 3A).
Because the proliferation of K562 cells was shown to be driven by
the protein kinase BCR-Abl, we asked whether WP1066 inhibits the
activity of BCR-Abl. We found that WP1066 did not affect the levels
of pCrkL, suggesting that the effect of WP1066 is not mediated
through the inhibition of BCR-Abl (Fig. 3B).
WP1066 induces cell cycle arrest in OCIM2 cells. Because
WP1066 inhibited the proliferation of AML cells, we wondered how
this JAK2 inhibitor would affect the progression of OCIM2 cells
through the cell cycle. We incubated OCIM2 cells with or without
2 Amol/L WP1066 for 2, 6, or 14 h and did cell cycle analysis using
flow cytometry. We found that exposure to WP1066 induced the
accumulation of OCIM2 cells in the G0-G1 phase of the cell cycle. As
shown in Fig. 4, after incubation for 14 h, only 9.0% of the WP1066treated cells compared with 26.2% of the untreated cells reached
the G2-M phase.
WP1066 induces apoptosis in OCIM2 and K562 cells. Because
WP1066 inhibited OCIM2 and K562 cell proliferation, inhibited
JAK2, and induced cell cycle arrest at the G0-G1 phase, we asked
whether WP1066 induces apoptotic cell death in AML cells. To
address this, we incubated OCIM2 and K562 cells at the peak of
their growth with 1, 2, or 3 Amol/L WP1066 for 4 h. Using the
annexin V–FITC assay, we found that WP1066 induced apoptosis in
both OCIM2 and K562 cells in a dose-dependent fashion (Fig. 5A).
Specifically, we noted that the percentage of cells undergoing

cells through the cell cycle. Depicted are the histograms
and percentages of cells in the G0-G1, S, and G2-M
phases of the cell cycle after 2 to 14 h of incubation with
2 Amol/L WP1066. A higher percentage of OCIM2 cells
in the G0-G1 phase was detected in the WP1066-treated
cells when compared with the control (WP1066-untreated)
cells, 72.4% versus 51.4%, after 14 h of incubation.

WP1066 Inhibits JAK2 in AML Cells

Figure 5. WP1066 induces caspase-dependent apoptosis. A, OCIM2 cells (left ) and K562 cells (right ) were incubated alone or with 1, 2, or 3 Amol/L WP1066 for 6 h.
The fraction of cells undergoing apoptosis was detected using annexin V–FITC assay. The percentages depict the dose-dependent increases in the apoptotic cell
fractions in the two cell lines. B, preincubation of OCIM2 cells with 20 Amol/L Z-VAD-FMK alone did not significantly affect the rate of cellular apoptosis (right top ), but
did partially reverse the apoptotic effect of WP1066 (right bottom ). C, incubation of OCIM2 and K562 cells for 6 h with 0.5 to 4.0 Amol/L WP1066 resulted in the
activation of caspase-3 and cleavage of PARP. The levels of procaspase-3, caspase-3, K562 (top ), and OCIM2 (bottom ) cells were incubated for 2 h in RPMI 1640
supplemented with 10% FCS and WP1066 at increasing concentrations (0.5–4.0 Amol/L; left ) and with 3 Amol/L WP1066 for 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 h (right ). JAK2 and
phosphorylated JAK2 were detected using Western immunoblotting as described in Materials and Methods. Equal protein loading was confirmed using anti–h-actin
antibodies, and uncleaved and cleaved PARP were measured in cell lysates using Western immunoblotting. The results show a dose-dependent increase in the levels
of cleaved caspase-3 and cleaved PARP.

apoptotic cell death increased from 5.9% in the OCIM2 control cells
to 51.7% in the treated OCIM2 cells and from 9.1% in the K562
control cells to 41.9% in the treated K562 cells. WP1066-induced
apoptosis was caspase dependent because it was partially reversed
by treatment with the pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK (Fig. 5B).
Incubation of OCIM2 cells with Z-VAD-FMK did not affect their
apoptotic rate, whereas preincubation of these cells with Z-VADFMK before treatment with WP1066 lowered their apoptotic rate
from 71.5% to 43.0% (the background apoptotic rate in this
experiment was 22.8%).
WP1066 activates procaspase-3 and cleaves PARP. Because
cleavage of procaspases converts them into biologically active
caspases, which in turn triggers apoptosis (27), we investigated the
effect of treatment with WP1066 on the activation of caspase-3,
a downstream executioner caspase in the apoptotic pathway. We
incubated OCIM2 and K562 cells with or without 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, or
4.0 Amol/L WP1066 for 4 h and measured procaspase-3 and cleaved
caspase-3 protein levels in these cells using Western immunoblotting. We found that WP1066 induced dose-dependent caspase-3
cleavage. Also, previous studies found that activated caspase-3

abrogated the effect of substrates that protect cellular integrity,
such as the DNA-repair enzyme PARP (27). Therefore, we measured
the PARP protein levels in both cell lines and found that WP1066
induced a dose-dependent increase in the cleaved PARP levels
(Fig. 5C).

Discussion
Cytoplasmic JAK proteins are crucial components of diverse
signal transduction pathways that govern cellular survival,
proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis (3). In AML cells
bearing the translocation t(9;12) (5), the catalytic domain of JAK2
is activated by the TEL gene and, in myeloproliferative disorders
and rare cases of AML, by a gain of function mutation (6, 28–30).
Notably, data accumulated in recent years show that constitutive
activation of either JAK2 (4, 5) or its downstream signaling
pathways is associated with poor outcome in patients with AML
(6–8). Taken together, these data suggest that JAK2 is a therapeutic
target in AML and prompted us to investigate the antileukemic
activity of the novel AG490 analogue WP1066.

Cancer Research

We first studied the effects of treatment with WP1066 on fresh
BM cells obtained from patients with AML. We found that this
treatment inhibited the proliferation of AML blast colony-forming
cells, and that the antiproliferative effect of WP1066 was more
pronounced in AML-CFUs than in normal marrow CFU-GM and
BFU-E colony-forming cells.
To elucidate the mechanism of action of WP1066, we
investigated its effects on the AML cell lines OCIM2 and K562.
Using a clonogenic assay, we found that WP1066 completely
abrogated colony growth of both cell lines at a concentration of
2 Amol/L. This effect was induced by arresting the progression of
leukemia cells through the cell cycle at G0-G1 phase and by
inducing caspase-dependent apoptotic cell death. Confirming our
hypothesis, we found that WP1066 inhibited JAK2 phosphorylation.
However, to our surprise, we found that unlike its protein kinase
inhibitor parent compound AG490 (11, 12), WP1066 also degraded
JAK2 protein without affecting its mRNA expression. Remarkably,
WP1066 did not significantly affect protein levels of other JAK
family members except those of JAK3 in K562 cells. Incubation of
OCIM2 cells with WP1066 at concentrations that induced JAK2
protein degradation did not reduce the levels either of JAK1, JAK3,
TYK2, or their phosphorylated forms. Furthermore, incubation of
K562 cells with WP1066 neither reduced the levels of JAK1 and
TYK2, nor of their phosphorylated forms, indicating specificity. As
expected, this effect resulted in the inhibition two of the signal
transduction pathways activated by JAK2. WP1066 inhibited the
phosphorylation of STAT3 and STAT5 and that of AKT.
The STATs belong to a family of latent cytoplasmic transcription
factors involved in the response of normal and leukemic
hematopoietic cells to a variety of extracellular signals (31–33).
Several growth factors and cytokines such as GM-CSF and
interleukin-3, interleukin-4, and interleukin-6 are abundant in
patients with AML. These proteins activate JAKs and, as a result,
the STAT pathway inducing proliferative and antiapoptotic effects
in AML cells (31–33). Indeed, several studies have shown
constitutive tyrosine phosphorylation and DNA binding of STAT3
and STAT5 in patients with AML and detected abnormal activation
of STAT1, STAT3, STAT5, and STAT6 in cells transformed by Src,
Abl, and other oncoproteins (34–36). Although growth factors and
cytokines might transduce their signal from their corresponding
cytoplasmic receptors to the nucleus by engaging other pathways,
JAK-STAT is one of the most important signaling pathways in AML
(37, 38). Agents that block the activity of JAK-STAT therefore have
the ability to influence AML cell reaction to cytokine stimulation
and reduce leukemia cell proliferation (38). In the present study, we
found that the exposure of AML cells to WP1066 significantly
inhibited the phosphorylation of both STAT3 and STAT5. Remarkably, a similar effect was recently observed in malignant glioma (39).
The tyrphostin AG490 has been thought to be a specific JAK2
inhibitor. However, several studies suggested that AG490 directly

inhibits STATs without affecting JAK activity (40, 41). Therefore, we
tested the effect of WP1066 on another JAK2-activated pathway.
Lipid second messengers derived from polyphosphoinositide
metabolism, such as PI3K, play a pivotal role in multiple cellsignaling networks. Several biological effects of PI3K are mediated
through the activation of the downstream serine/threonine protein
kinase AKT (protein kinase B; ref. 42). The PI3K signaling pathway
is frequently activated in blast cells of patients with AML and
contributes to the survival and proliferation of these cells.
Furthermore, constitutive activation of the PI3K pathway correlates
with decreased survival in patients with AML (8). Notably, in a
previous study, we found that inhibition of the PI3K pathway
suppresses proliferation and induces apoptosis of AML cells (43). In
the present study, we found that WP1066 suppressed the
phosphorylation of AKT, suggesting that WP1066 inactivated
JAK2 and, as a result, inhibited two of the JAK2-activated signaling
pathways.
We previously established that STA3 and STAT5 are constitutively phosphorylated in OCIM2 cells, and that activation of the
JAK-STAT pathway stimulates OCIM2 cell proliferation (13). In
contrast, there is no consensus as to which signaling pathways
are engaged in stimulating the proliferation of K562 cells. Similar
to our group, other investigators found that JAK2 and STAT5
are constitutively activated in K562 cells (44, 45). Similarly, other
researchers found that both STAT3 and STAT5 were constitutively tyrosine phosphorylated and transcriptionally active in
K562 (46–48). Although the current belief is that STAT5 is
directly activated by BCR-Abl (45–47, 49), Skorski et al. (50)
reported that PI3K is constitutively activated by BCR-Abl, and
Samanta et al. (48) found that JAK2 plays a crucial role in the
proliferation of K562 cells. Our data showing constitutive phosphorylation of JAK2 and AKT support these reports. However,
because WP1066 inhibited the JAK-STAT and PI3K pathways
without affecting the levels of pCrkL, it is unlikely that BCR-Abl
induces JAK2 phosphorylation.
In conclusion, we showed that the novel AG490 analogue
WP1066 inhibited JAK2 and its downstream STAT and PI3K
pathways. By doing so, WP1066 blocked the progression of AML
cells through the cell cycle, inhibited AML cell proliferation, and
induced caspase-dependent apoptotic cell death in AML cells.
These findings suggest that WP1066 is a potent agent whose
antineoplastic properties and in vivo activity warrant further
investigation.
