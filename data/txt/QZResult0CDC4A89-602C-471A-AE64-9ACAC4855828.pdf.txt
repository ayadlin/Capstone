ABSTRACT
Squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (HNSCC) is characterized by
high morbidity and mortality. Treatment failure, drug resistance and chemoradiation
toxicity have necessitated the development of alternative treatment strategies. Styryl
benzyl sulfones, a family of novel small molecule inhibitors, are being evaluated as
anti-neoplastic agents in multiple clinical trials. The activity of these compounds has
been well characterized in several preclinical tumor studies, but their activity has yet
to be fully examined in HNSCC. We tested ON 01910.Na (rigosertib), a styryl benzyl
sulfone in late-stage development, in HNSCC preclinical models. Rigosertib induced
cytotoxicity in both HPV(+) and HPV(-) HNSCC cells in a dose-dependent manner.
Characterization of the underlying molecular mechanism indicated that rigosertib
induced inhibition of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway, induced oxidative stress resulting
in increased generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and activated extracellular
signal-regulated kinases (ERK1/2) and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK). Increased
phosphorylation and cytoplasmic translocation of ATF-2 were also observed following
rigosertib treatment. These changes in cell signaling led us to consider combining
rigosertib with HNSCC standard-of-care therapies, such as cisplatin and radiation. Our
study highlights the promising preclinical activity of rigosertib in HNSCC irrespective
of HPV status and provides a molecular basis for rigosertib in combination with
standard of care agents for HNSCC.

etiological factor for HNSCC is human papillomavirus
(HPV) infection, which is associated with the fastest
growing subgroup, oropharyngeal squamous cell
carcinoma (OPSCC) [4, 10]. Conventional treatments for
HPV(+) and HPV(-) HNSCC are often accompanied by
adverse effects, and acquired resistance is common [5, 11,
12]. Thus, there is a critical need for new treatment options
with enhanced safety profiles and varied mechanisms of
action.
Styryl benzyl sulfones are currently being evaluated in
clinical trials as potential cancer therapeutics [13–16]. These
compounds are potent antimitotic agents that preferentially
induce G2/M cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in tumor cells,
with little or no effect on normal cells [14, 17, 18]. We have
previously shown that one such compound, ON 01910.

INTRODUCTION
Head and neck cancer is a major global health
problem [1], and squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC)
is its most common subtype [2, 3]. Fifty percent of
HNSCC patients present with regionally advanced
disease [2, 4]. Despite recent progress, only 40 – 50% of
these individuals survive five years post-diagnosis, and
median survival for recurrent or metastatic HNSCC is
less than one year [2, 4]. Many factors contribute to the
etiopathogenesis of head and neck cancer [5]. Tobacco
use and alcohol consumption are major risk factors [6–8],
while other factors such as poor diet and dental hygiene,
gastroesophageal reflux, immunosuppression, marijuana
use, and various inherited syndromes may also play
roles in disease pathogenesis [9]. The most well defined

other oncogenic signaling cascades in mantle cell lymphoma
(MCL) cell lines [19]. Here, we examined the efficacy of
ON 01910.Na and a non-bioactive isomer, ON 01911 (Figure
1) on cultured HPV(-) and HPV(+) cell lines. We observed
inhibition of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway and induction
of oxidative stress following rigosertib treatment. We also
observed cytoplasmic translocation of ATF-2 in rigosertibmediated cell death. Cytoplasmic accumulation of ATF-2 was
found to sensitize tumor cells to standard-of-care HNSCC
treatments, such as cisplatin and radiation. These findings
suggest that rigosertib, in combination with standard-ofcare therapies, could be of therapeutic value in HNSCC
irrespective of HPV status, and should be studied further.

(Figure 2C). IC50 values were submicromolar for all
cell lines tested: FaDu (0.213 μM), Detroit 562 (0.248
μM), UMSCC 1 (0.146 μM), UMSCC 47 (0.083 μM),
and UMSCC 104 (0.087 μM). These data indicate that
rigosertib reduced the viability of HNSCC cells, regardless
of HPV status. To further characterize the mechanism
by which rigosertib is cytotoxic to HNSCC cells, we
incubated FaDu and Detroit 562 cell lines with 0 – 10.0
μM of rigosertib or ON 01911.Na, or DMSO for 48 hours
and evaluated apoptosis using a TUNEL kit. Rigosertib
induced apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 2D
& 2E). Next, we analyzed rigosertib-mediated apoptosis
in the presence and absence of the pan-caspase inhibitor
Z-VAD-FMK. We found that Z-VAD-FMK significantly
abrogated rigosertib-mediated apoptosis in HNSCC cells
indicating rigosertib induced apoptosis by activating
the caspase cascade (Figure 2F). Further, fluorescence
microscopic analysis of TUNEL staining revealed
increased Fluorescein-dUTP labeling in rigosertib treated
cells, and thus confirmed that apoptosis occurs in HNSCC
cells upon rigosertib treatment (Figure 2G). To further
characterize the apoptotic mechanisms, we evaluated the
effects of rigosertib on PARP, Caspase-3 and Caspase-9
cleavage by Western blot analysis (Figure 2H). Cleavage
of all three proteins occurred in a dose-dependent manner.
Notably, we also observed decreased levels of Mcl-1,
an important pro-survival protein in rigosertib treated
HNSCC cells (Figure 2H). This finding is similar to our
previous observations following rigosertib treatment of
hematologic cancer cell lines [19, 26] and suggests that
inhibition of Mcl-1 is a central mechanism by which
rigosertib activates programmed cell death in cancer cells.

RESULTS
Evaluating HPV status of HNSCC cell lines
Characteristically, HPV(+) and HPV(-) HNSCCs use
different molecular mechanisms to inhibit apoptosis and
enhance proliferation [20], and thus respond differently
to standard chemotherapeutic agents [21–25]. Therefore,
we evaluated the HPV status of five HNSCC cell lines by
PCR, using primers for HPV E6. HPV E6 sequences were
not detected in FaDu, Detroit 562, or UMSCC 1 cell lines
(Figure 2A). Strong E6 amplification was observed in
UMSCC 47 cells, and weak E6 amplification was detected
in UMSCC 104 cells (Figure 2A). Further we confirmed
the expression of HPV E6 protein in these two cell lines
by Western blot analysis (Figure 2B).

We analyzed the effects of rigosertib on viability of

26] demonstrated that rigosertib inhibits PI3K/Akt/mTOR
signaling. To evaluate the effects of rigosertib on PI3K/
Akt/mTOR signaling in HNSCC, we incubated FaDu and
UMSCC 47 cells with DMSO (vehicle control), 1.0 μM
ON 01911.Na (inactive control compound), or rigosertib
(0 – 10 μM) for 12 hours, and assessed PI3K activity by
ELISA. Rigosertib inhibited cellular PI3K activity in a
dose-dependent manner (Figure 3A) independent of HPV
status. We next examined the phosphorylation status of key
components and targets of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway.
Western blot analysis (Figures 3B and 3C) showed that
rigosertib inhibited phosphorylation of mTOR and Akt in
FaDu cells. Previous studies have shown that rigosertib alters
the expression of Cyclin D1 and cyclin dependent kinases

(CDKs) and thereby regulates the cell cycle [18, 19]. Hence,
we analyzed the expression of Cyclin D1, CDK2 and CDK4
in rigosertib-treated HNSCC cells and found that rigosertib
significantly reduced the expression of these molecules in a
dose-dependent manner. Taken together, these data suggest
that rigosertib inhibits PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling, resulting
in inhibition of cell cycle progression.

species (ROS) generation and JNK pathway activation
[19, 26]. We evaluated the effect of rigosertib on these
pathways in HNSCC cell lines. Rigosertib treatment led
to dose-dependent increases in ROS in FaDu cells (Figure
4A). Since ROS generation is known to activate cellular
stress pathways via JNK and p38 and to trigger apoptosis
[29], we extended our studies to evaluate the activation
of JNK/AP-1 pathway proteins. MSK1 is a stressactivated protein kinase that is activated downstream
of both the ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK cascades [30]. We
observed rigosertib-enhanced phosphorylation of Erk1/2
and MSK-1 in a dose-dependent manner, thus indicating
activation of this stress response pathway (Figure 4B). Our
analysis of the JNK pathway showed significant increases
in phosphorylated JNK, c-Jun and ATF2 following
rigosertib treatment. Activated JNK promotes apoptosis by
stimulating c-Jun/AP1 responsive gene expression and by
ATF2 translocation to the mitochondria and cytoplasmic

release of cytochrome c [29]. To determine whether
rigosertib activates JNK-dependent apoptosis in both
HPV(+) and HPV(-) cell lines, we incubated UMSCC 1
(HPV-), UMSCC 47 (HPV+), and UMSCC 104 (HPV+)
cells with 1.0 μM ON 01911.Na or 1.0 μM rigosertib for
24 hours and then assessed the activation state of JNK and
ATF-2 by Western blot analysis (Figure 4C). Rigosertib
enhanced the phosphorylation of JNK and ATF-2 in all
three HNSCC cell lines examined, indicating activation
of cellular stress response through JNK signaling in both
HPV(+) and HPV(-) cell lines.

Rigosertib induces ATF-2 translocation to the
mitochondria
Rigosertib treatment leads to a dramatic increase
in phosphorylated ATF-2, a stress-associated kinase
associated with many critical cellular processes [31].

Previous studies have suggested a role for ATF-2 in
oncogenic and tumor-suppressor functions [32]. A recent
study by Varsano et al. [33] has shown that translocation
of ATF-2 from the nucleus to the mitochondrial outer
membrane, inhibits the growth of melanoma cells and
induces apoptosis. Hence, we sought to further analyze
the role of ATF-2 in rigosertib-mediated effects in
HNSCC. To that end, we separated subcellular fractions
from vehicle, ON 01911.Na-, and rigosertib-treated FaDu
cells and analyzed the levels of total and p-ATF-2. We
observed dramatic increase in p-ATF-2 and ATF-2 levels
in both cytoplasmic and mitochondrial fractions following
rigosertib treatment suggesting nuclear export (Figure
5A). Rigosertib-dependent translocation of p-ATF-2

occurred in HNSCC independent of HPV status, but
did not occur in Normal Human Dermal Microvascular
Endothelial Cells (HMVEC-d), suggesting that rigosertibinduced translocation of ATF-2 may be specific to tumor
cells (Figure 5B). Concomitant with ATF-2 translocation,
we observed higher levels of cytochrome c (Cyt c) in the
cytoplasmic fraction and increased cleaved PARP levels in
the nuclear fraction of HNSCC cells treated with rigosertib
(Figure 5A). Since ATF-2 nuclear export and translocation
to the mitochondria is known to perturb the HK1-VDAC1
complex and to increase mitochondrial permeability [34,
35], we analyzed mitochondrial membrane potential
using DiOC6(3) pre-loaded FaDu cells. Treatment with
rigosertib resulted in decreased fluorescence, indicating

(Figure 5C).

Aqueous Non-Radioactive Cell Proliferation Assay) and
combination index (CI) values were determined using
CalcuSyn software. The combination of rigosertib and
cisplatin displayed additivity or synergism (i.e., CI < 1) at
multiple concentrations, indicating that the administration
of both drugs has a greater effect on HNSCC cell viability
than either drug alone (Figures 6A and 6B).
Recent preclinical studies by Agony et al [39] have
shown that rigosertib is a more effective radiosensitizer
than cisplatin in concurrent chemoradiation treatment of
cervical carcinoma both in vitro and in vivo. Expanding on
these findings, we hypothesized that the effect of rigosertib
on ATF-2 and mitochondrial membrane potential would
likely sensitize HNSCC cells to radiation treatment.
To this end, we analyzed the combinational effects of
rigosertib and radiation in HPV(-) FaDu cells and HPV(+)
UMSCC 47 cells. Cell lines were pretreated with various
concentrations (0 - 1.0 μM) of rigosertib for 24 hours
and then subjected to radiation (6Gy). Cytotoxicity was
measured 24 hours after irradiation. Cell death increased
significantly with combination treatment compared to

Rigosertib in combination with chemotherapy or
radiation induces significant cytotoxicity in HPV
cell lines
Cytoplasmic accumulation of ATF-2 resulting in
altered mitochondrial membrane potential has been shown
to enhance the sensitivity of cancer cells to cytotoxic
agents [33, 36, 37] and radiation [38]. Rigosertib, through
activation of the JNK pathway and ATF-2 translocation,
could serve as a sensitizing agent for conventional
cytotoxic therapy and radiation. To test this hypothesis,
we analyzed the combination of rigosertib and cisplatin, a
standard-of-care cytotoxic agent for HNSCC (Figures 6A
and 6B). FaDu and UMSCC 47 cell lines were incubated
with rigosertib (0.03 μM – 5.0 μM), cisplatin (0.07 μM –
10.0 μM), or a combination of the two drugs for 48 hours.
Cellular viability was calculated by MTS (Cell Titer 96®

The combination of rigosertib and radiation was active in
both HPV(+) and HPV(-) cell lines, although we observed
slightly greater efficacy in HPV(+) cells.

have been directly linked to the pathogenesis of HPV(+)
HNSCC and its resistance to the standard of care agent,
cisplatin [42–45]. In the current, study we observed that
rigosertib inhibited cellular PI3K pathway activity in both
HPV(+) and HPV(-) HSNCC cells, while also blocking
the activation of key downstream effector proteins in
survival and cell cycle control pathways.
Recent evidence suggests that rigosertib acts to
inhibit PI3K activity through a mechanism that may affect
multiple signaling cascades leading to cancer cell death.
We therefore explored the effect of rigosertib on additional
complementary pathways related to apoptosis in order to
further understand the activity of rigosertib in HNSCC
beyond PI3K inhibition. In a recent study Chapman et al
[26] demonstrated ROS-induced oxidative stress responses
upon treatment with rigosertib. Similarly, our analysis
revealed that rigosertib treatment led to a robust increase
in ROS levels and further triggered the stress response
cascade by activation of MAPK pathways (ERK and JNK/
SAPK) and phosphorylation and nuclear accumulation of
c-JUN and ATF-2.
The dramatic increase in phosphorylated ATF2 was notable and led us to further investigate the
role of this protein in rigosertib activity. ATF-2, a

DISCUSSION
Squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck
is a common cancer with high morbidity and limited
therapeutic options [2, 4, 5]. The small molecule
inhibitor, rigosertib, was previously shown to be an
effective anti-proliferative agent in HNSCC cell lines
and HNSCC patient-derived xenografts [40]. Here, we
studied the effects of rigosertib in HPV(-) and HPV(+)
HNSCC cell lines and characterized combination
approaches of this novel anti-cancer agent with
standard-of-care therapies.
In previous studies, we and others have shown
that rigosertib inhibits the PI3K pathway [19, 26,
40]. Activation of PI3K and its role in oncogenesis,
progression and resistance to chemotherapeutic agents has
become more evident in recent studies of HNSCC [27, 28,
41]. Furthermore, HPV 16 oncoproteins E6 and E7, are
known to induce activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway and

with increasing concentrations (0-1μM) of rigosertib for 24 h, then cells exposed to radiation (6Gy). After 24 h, cell viability was measured
by using Cellometer AutoT4 cell counter. Untreated cells were considered 100% viable and percent viability of each sample was calculated.

member of ATF/CREB family of transcription factors,
is activated by Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), p38,
or extracellular-signal-regulated kinase 1 (ERK1)
through phosphorylation events at Thr69 and Thr71
[31]. Activated ATF-2 binds to the AP1 complex to
regulate diverse cellular functions and can either act in
tumor promotion or tumor suppression depending on
its sub-cellular localization [32, 33, 46, 47]. The exact
molecular mechanisms involved in this differential
action have yet to be elucidated. However, recent
studies suggest that cellular stress or genotoxic stimuli
induce cytoplasmic translocation of ATF-2 and inhibit
its transcriptional activity [33]. Once in the cytoplasm,
ATF-2 localizes to the outer membrane of mitochondria,
where it binds to the HK1 and VDAC1 complexes that
regulate mitochondrial membrane potential and pore
permeability [32, 34, 35]. Mobilization of ATF-2 to
mitochondria alters the HK1-VDAC1 complex, resulting
in disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential,
activation of pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins and
leakage of cytochrome c [32].
Our studies indicated that rigosertib treatment
leads to cytoplasmic translocation of phosphorylated and
total ATF-2, thus altering the mitochondrial membrane
potential in HNSCC cells. Disruptions in mitochondrial
membrane potential were associated with increased levels
of cytoplasmic cytochrome c, indicating induction of
mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis by rigosertib. We did
not observe these effects in HUVEC (D-HMVEC) cells,
suggesting that these rigosertib-mediated cytotoxic effects
occur only in tumor cells. Taken together, these findings
indicate that rigosertib induces apoptosis in HNSCC cells,
independent of HPV status, by a central mechanism that
involves ATF-2.
Cytoplasmic accumulation of ATF-2 and altered
mitochondrial membrane potential have been shown
to enhance the sensitivity of cancer cells to cytotoxic
agents and radiation [33, 36–38], leading us to
hypothesize that rigosertib could act synergistically in
combination with HNSCC standard-of-care therapies.
Treatment with rigosertib was found to significantly
enhance apoptosis of HNSCC when combined with
chemotherapy or radiation. Additive or synergistic
activity was noted when rigosertib was combined with
cisplatin or radiation, suggesting that the combination
of rigosertib with cisplatin or radiation could be an
effective therapeutic strategy against HNSCC.
During the preparation of this manuscript, AthuluriDivakar et al [48] reported the molecular mechanism of
action of rigosertib. Rigosertib acts as a RAS mimetic by
binding directly to the Ras Binding Domains (RBDs) of
RAS effector proteins. Consequently, rigosertib acts to
inhibit multiple potentially oncogenic signaling pathways
including those of the RAS-RAF-MEK axis. In vitro
binding assays also indicated that rigosertib binds directly
to the RBD of PI3K.

In 2006, cetuximab, a human mouse chimeric
monoclonal anti-EGFR antibody was approved in
conjunction with radiotherapy for locally advanced
HNSCC [49]. Cetuximab treatment, while efficacious,
is also associated with a resistance phenotype, thus
limiting its effectiveness as an HNSCC treatment.
In 2014, Rampias et al [50], using patient biopsies,
cetuximab-resistant cell lines, and transgenic mice
designed to form RAS-driven oral tumors determined
the basis for de novo cetuximab resistance. Oncogenic
HRAS induces tumorigenesis in HNSCC following
activation of ERK signaling leading to expression of a
specific gene signature involving C-myc, BCL-2, BCLXL and cyclin D1. In 2016, Braig et al [51], used liquid
biopsy specimens from HNSCC patients to examine
genetic changes accompanying cetuximab treatment via
next generation sequencing. In a significant number of
patients tested, RAS mutations were infrequent before
treatment, but arose in response to cetuximab exposure.
This led to the conclusion that RAS mutations provide
the basis for cetuximab resistance and for HNSCC
disease progression. Rigosertib acts to suppress RAS
signaling through its association with the RBDs of RAS
downstream effectors, and could be added to cetuximab/
radiotherapy protocols to treat patients who have
exhibited cetuximab resistance.

PCR analysis

Preparation of mitochondrial, nuclear and
cytosolic and fractions

Total DNA (100 ng) from each cell line was amplified
in Bio-Rad MyCycler for 30 cycles. The amplified product
was electrophoresed through 2% agarose gel. The following
primers were used to amplify the viral E6 gene: HPV-16-F:
ACGTTGGATGATGTTCAGGACCCACAGGA and HPV16- R: ACGTTGGATGCACGTCGCAGAACTGTTGC.
These primers were ordered from Integrated DNA
technologies, (Coralville, Iowa).

Subcellular fractions were prepared using the
Mitochondria/Cytosol Fractionation Kit (Biovision
Mountain View, CA, USA) and NE-PER™ Nuclear
and Cytoplasmic Extraction Reagents (ThermoFisher
Scientific) per manufacturer’s instructions. A COX
IV antibody was used to monitor the purity of the
mitochondrial fraction.

Cell viability assay

Western blotting

Cell viability was examined by using the Cell
Proliferation Assay Kit (Promega, Madison, WI) per the
manufacturer’s instructions. FaDu, Detroit 562, UMSCC
1, UMSCC 47 and UMSCC 104 cells were plated at a
density of 4 x 103 cells per well of a 96-well plate with or
without indicated concentrations of rigosertib. IC50 values
for rigosertib on each cell line were determined using
CalcuSyn software (Biosoft, Cambridge, UK).

Drug-treated cells were lysed, solubilized and
electrophoresed and blotted as described previously [19].
Equal amounts of cell lysates were separated and subjected
to Western Blotting using the antibodies described above.

Irradiation
Irradiation of HNSCC cells was performed as
described previously [39]. Cells were pretreated with
drug or control and then exposed to radiation (6Gy) using
a γ-ray irradiator. Twenty-four hours later, cell viability
was assessed using a Cellometer® AutoT4 Cell Viability
Counter (Nexcelom Bioscience, Lawrence, MA).

TUNEL assay
Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP
nick end labeling (TUNEL) was conducted using Cell
Death Detection Kit, Fluorescein (Roche Diagnostics,
Basel, Switzerland). Cells were treated as described
above with various concentrations of rigosertib for 48
hours and stained with TUNEL reaction mixture per the
manufacturer’s instructions. Staining was quantified using
a FACSVANTAGE™ flow cytometer (BD Biosciences,
San Jose, CA) or images were captured by fluorescent
microscopy.

Confocal microscopy
FaDu, UMSCC 47 and D-HMVEC cells were
treated with drug or control for 24 hours and then fixed 4%
paraformaldehydeand blocked with 5% normal goat serum
in PBS/Triton. Cells were then incubated with relevant
antibodies, washed with PBS, and stained with Alexa
Fluor® 568–labeled anti–mouse IgG antibody (Molecular
Probes®, Life Sciences Solutions Group) and/or Alexa
Fluor® 488 phalloidin (Molecular Probes®). Cells
were again washed with PBS, and slides were mounted
using ProLong® Gold Antifade Mountant with DAPI
(4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; Molecular Probes®).
Slides were examined under a Zeiss 510 Meta confocal
microscope (Carl Zeiss Microimaging, LLC, Thornwood,
NY), and images were acquired using LSM 510 software
(Carl Zeiss).

Detecting reactive oxygen species
Analysis of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was
performed as described previously [52]. Cells were
incubated with 10 μmol/L 5-(and-6)-carboxy-2',7'dichlorodihydrofluorescein
diacetate
(H2DCFDA)
(Invitrogen™, Life Sciences Solutions Group,
ThermoFisher Scientific) for 30 minutes, washed, and
incubated with DMSO, 1.0 μM ON 01911.Na, or 0 – 1.0
μM rigosertib for 12 hours. ROS (fluorescent green) were
quantified by flow cytometry.
