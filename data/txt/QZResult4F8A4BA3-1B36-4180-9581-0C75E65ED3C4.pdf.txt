Abstract
Gastric cancer is one of the most common causes of cancer-related death worldwide. Helicobacter pylori
infection plays an important role in the development and progression of gastric cancer. The expression of
astrocyte-elevated gene-1 (AEG-1) is increased in gastric cancer tissues, thereby contributing to the inﬂammatory
response. We investigated whether and how AEG-1 regulated proinﬂammatory signaling in gastric cancer cells.
We used human gastric cancer cell lines and athymic nude mice to investigate the role of AEG-1 in the regulation
of the TLR4/nuclear factor-kB (NF-kB) signaling pathway and cancer invasion and compared the expression of
AEG-1 and related proteins in 93 patients with gastric cancer by immunohistochemistry. In human gastric cancer
cells, both AEG-1 and TLR4 could be induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation. AEG-1 was upregulated via
LPS-TLR4 signaling and in turn promoted nuclear translocation of the NF-kB p65 subunit. At the same time, AEG1 overexpression decreased the levels of suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) protein SOCS-1, a negative
regulator of the TLR4 pathway. Furthermore, nude mice engrafted with AEG-1/TLR4-expressing cells demonstrated larger tumor volumes than control animals. In patients with gastric cancer, the expression of AEG-1
correlated with that of TLR4, SOCS-1, and NF-kB and was higher in tumors compared with noncancerous
adjacent tissues. Overall survival in patients with gastric cancer with simultaneous expression of AEG-1 and TLR4
was poor. Our results demonstrate that AEG-1 can promote gastric cancer progression by a positive feedback
TLR4/NF-kB signaling-related mechanism, thus providing new mechanistic explanation for the role of inﬂammation in cancer progression. Cancer Res; 74(19); 5541–52. 2014 AACR.

Introduction
Gastric cancer remains the fourth most common cancer and
the second leading cause of cancer-related death in the world
(1). Early detection, dietary changes, and reduction in chronic
Helicobacter pylori infection have resulted in a substantial
decrease of stomach cancer rates in most parts of the world
(2, 3). However, China alone accounts for nearly 42% of all
gastric cancer cases worldwide (4).
AEG-1, also known as metadherin (MTDH) or LYRIC, is
induced in primary human fetal astrocytes infected with HIV-1
or treated with recombinant HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein
(gp120) or tumor necrosis factor-a (TNFa; refs. 5 and 6).
AEG-1 is markedly overexpressed in many tumors such as
breast cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, and neuroblastoma
(7–9). In our previous study, we have also observed high

expression of AEG-1 in gastric cancer (10). Functional studies
have demonstrated that AEG-1 can promote tumor proliferation, invasion, chemoresistance, angiogenesis, and metastasis
(11–14).
AEG-1 oncogenic properties are linked to several signaling
pathways, including those of nuclear factor-kB (NF-kB), PI3K/
AKT, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and Wnt (15).
The NF-kB pathway, which plays an important role in inﬂammation and tumorigenesis, was the ﬁrst one shown to be
activated by AEG-1 (16). It is well known that inﬂammatory
responses play decisive roles at different stages of tumor
development, including initiation, promotion, malignant conversion, invasion, and metastasis (17). H. pylori can either
directly promote gastrointestinal carcinogenesis through the
enhanced production of free radicals or indirectly through the
establishment of carcinogenic environment because of longterm inﬂammation of the gastric mucosa, which eventually
results in mucosal atrophy, intestinal metaplasia, and cancer.
Accordingly, chronic inﬂammation caused by H. pylori is a
major step in the initiation and development of gastric cancer
(18). However, the exact mechanism remains unclear.
Our previous study has demonstrated that AEG-1 expression
is upregulated in gastric cell lines and clinical specimens and is
associated with unfavorable prognosis (10). We also observed
that patients with gastric cancer with H. pylori infection had
poor overall and relapse-free survival (19). H. pylori is a gramnegative bacterium characterized as a class I carcinogen for its

role in the pathogenesis of gastric cancer (20). Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is the most important component of the outer
membrane of gram-negative bacteria and a TLR4 ligand, which
has been shown to induce AEG-1 expression in human promonocytic (21) and breast cancer cells (22).
In this study, we explored the role of AEG-1 in the regulation
of TLR4/NF-kB signaling in gastric cancer. Our results indicate
that AEG-1 directly regulates the expression of NF-kB–dependent genes in cancer cells. As expected, AEG-1 could be
induced by LPS stimulation in TLR4-positive gastric cancer
cells. Furthermore, we also present evidence of a positive
feedback loop between AEG-1 and the TLR4/NF-kB signaling
pathways. This study shows that AEG-1 plays a role in gastric
cancer progression via inﬂammatory mechanisms, suggesting
that it could be a potential target for therapeutic intervention
in gastric cancer.

Patients and Methods
Tissue samples, cell culture, and chemicals
Patients with gastric cancer who underwent curative surgery in the Gastrointestinal Surgery Department of the First
Afﬁliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University from 2006 to 2007
were included in this study. There were 64 men and 29 women
between 24 and 82 years old (average age, 56.3 years). Informed
consent was obtained from all patients. Four samples of gastric
cancer tumors and the matched adjacent noncancerous gastric tissues were obtained by biopsy and frozen at 80 C.
Gastric cancer cell lines SGC7901, AGS, HGC27, MGC803,
and BGC823 and normal gastric epithelial GES-1 cells were
obtained from the type Culture Collection of Chinese Academy
of Sciences (Shanghai, China). These cell lines were authenticated using short tandem repeat (STR) proﬁling, isoenzyme
analysis, and cell viability analysis. All cell lines used in this
study were regularly screened for mycoplasma contamination
and tested negative for the same. AGS cells were cultured in F12
medium, and other cells were grown in RPMI-1640 medium
(both media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS),
50 U/mL penicillin, and 50 mg/mL streptomycin) in a humidiﬁed atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air at 37 C.
Escherichia coli LPS (0111:b4) and proteasome inhibitor
MG132 were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co.
Cell transfection with plasmids and siRNAs
The expression plasmids for AEG-1 (EX-T7038-M02), TLR4
(EX-K2201-M02), and SOCS-1 (EX-K2201-M02), and the GFPexpressing vector M02 were purchased from GeneCopoeia. All
siRNAs were obtained from RiboBio. The primers used were as
follows: si-AEG-1 sense, 50 -CAGAUAAAUCCAAGUCAAAdTdT30 and antisense, 50 -dTdTGUCUAUUUAGGUUCAGUUU-30 ; siTLR-4 sense, 50 -GGUGUGAAAUCCAGACAAUdTdT-30 and
antisense, 50 -dTdTCCACACUUUAGGUCUGUUA-30 . Transfections were performed using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen)
according to the manufacturer's protocol.
Immunohistochemistry and immunoﬂuorescence
Immunohistochemistry analysis of formalin-ﬁxed and parafﬁn-embedded gastric tissues was performed as previously
described (10) using primary antibodies against AEG-1/MTDH

(1:100; Epitomics), TLR4, NF-kB (both 1:50; Abgent), and SOCS1 (1:50; Sigma-Aldrich).
The immunostaining index was based on the proportion of
positively stained tumor cells and staining intensity. The
proportion of positively stained tumor cells was graded as 0
(no positively stained cells), 1 (<10%), 2 (10%–50%), and 3
(>50% of positive cells), and staining intensity was scored as 0
(no staining), 1 (light yellow), 2 (yellow brown), and 3 (brownish-yellow staining). The immunostaining index was then
calculated as staining intensity score multiplied by the proportion of positively stained tumor cells; tumors with the
indexes 0 to 2 were considered immunostaining-negative and
those with 3 to 9 were scored immunostaining-positive.
Cells cultured in 24-well plates were transfected with either
50 or 100 nmol/L scrambled siRNA and si-AEG-1 for 48 hours.
Cells were ﬁxed with 4% formaldehyde in PBS, permeabilized
with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 30 minutes, rinsed with PBS,
and incubated with NF-kB antibody at 4 C overnight and then
with Alexa Fluor 488–conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Invitrogen)
for 1 hour at room temperature. DAPI (KGA215; KeyGen
Biotech) was used to stain the nuclei. Images were analyzed
using an Olympus ﬂuorescence microscope.
Quantitative real-time RT-PCR
Total RNA was extracted from cells or tissues with RNAiso
(Takara) following the manufacturer's protocol, and 500 ng was
reverse-transcribed using PrimeScript RT Master Mix
(Takara). Quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed with cDNA as a template in the presence of SYBR
Premix Ex Taq (Tli RNaseH Plus; Takara). The primers are
listed in Supplementary Table S1. The levels of mRNA were
normalized to that of GAPDH.
Protein extraction and immunoblotting
Whole-cell lysates were prepared using the Whole Cell
Protein Extraction Kit; nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins
were isolated using the Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Protein
Extraction Kit (KeyGen Biotech). Protein concentration was
determined by the Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo
Fisher Scientiﬁc Inc.). Equal amounts of protein were
resolved by SDS-PAGE using 10% or 12% gels and transferred
to polyvinylidene diﬂuoride (PVDF) membranes. The membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in PBS and
probed with primary antibodies speciﬁc to the NF-kB subunit p65 (1:1,000; Cell Signaling Technology), AEG-1
(1:1,000), lamin B (1:1,000; Epitomics), TLR4 (1:1,000), and
SOCS-1 (1:1,000). Protein expression levels were normalized
to that of GAPDH.
NF-kB–dependent luciferase assay
Gastric cancer cells transfected with AEG-1 siRNA or scrambled siRNA were incubated for 48 hours in a 48-well plate and
transfected with 0.2 mg/well of the pGL4.32[luc2P/NF-kB-RE/
Hygro] vector and an equal amount of the pRL-TK plasmid
(Promega) using the Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen)
according to the manufacturer's recommendations. After 48
hours of incubation, luminescent signals were measured using
the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay Kit (Promega) according to

the manufacturer's protocol. The data are presented as the
mean  SD of three independent experiments.
Invasion assay
Cell invasion was assessed in 24-well BioCoat Invasion
chambers containing membranes coated with Matrigel (BD
Biosciences), according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Cells (5  104/well) transfected with the vector (V), V-AEG1, V-TLR4, or V-AEG-1 and V-TLR4 were seeded in the upper
chambers in 1% FBS-containing RPMI-1640, whereas the lower
chambers were ﬁlled with RPMI-1640 supplemented with 5%
FBS. Cells were incubated at 37 C for 24 hours; the membranes
were removed, ﬁxed, and stained with crystal violet. Cells on
the upper membrane surface were removed by wiping with a
cotton swab and invasion was determined by counting the cells
migrated to the lower membrane side under the microscope.
At least 5 ﬁelds were counted in each experiment performed in
triplicate.
Cell-proliferation assays
The 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (MTT) assay and colony-formation assay were used
to assess cell proliferation. For the MTT assay, cells transfected
with the vector (V), V-AEG-1, V-TLR4, or V-AEG-1, and V-TLR4
were seeded in 96-well plates (5  103 cells/well) in medium
containing 10% or 1% FBS with or without LPS and cultured for
24, 48, and 72 hours. For the colony-formation assay, cells were
seeded in 60-mm plates (200 cells/plate) in RPMI-1640 and
treated with the indicated pharmacologic inhibitors or LPS.
Colonies of >50 cells were scored after 2 weeks.
Xenograft studies in athymic nude mice
Cancer cells transfected the vector (V), V-AEG-1, V-TLR4,
or V-AEG-1 and V-TLR4 were established as subcutaneous
xenografts in the ﬂanks of 5-week-old male Balb/c nu/nu
mice (Guangdong Medical Laboratory Animal Center, China) using 5  106 cells of each cell line (5 mice/line). Tumor
volumes were measured every 3 days with a caliper and
calculated using the following formula: larger diameter 
(smaller diameter)2/2.
Statistical analysis
Data were analyzed using the SPSS 15.0 statistical software.
The results are expressed as the mean  SD of at least three
independent experiments. The difference between groups was
assessed by the unpaired two-tailed Student t test. A P value of
<0.05 was considered statistically signiﬁcant.

Results
Upregulation of AEG-1 and TLR4 in gastric cancer tissues
and cancer cell lines
RT-PCR and Western blotting analyses were used to investigate mRNA and protein expression of AEG-1 and TLR4 in 4
patients (paired gastric tumor tissues and matched normal
mucosal) and in human gastric cell lines (SGC7901, AGS,
HGC27, MGC803, and BGC823).
For all the 4 patients examined, protein and mRNA expression of both AEG-1 and TLR4 was higher in gastric tumors than

www.aacrjournals.org

in the adjacent noncancerous gastric tissues from the same
patient (Fig. 1A–C). The expression was also higher in
SGC7901, MGC803, and BGC82-3 gastric cancer cells than in
normal gastric epithelial GES-1 cells (Fig. 1D–F). Because the
SGC7901 cell line expressed the highest levels of TLR4, it was
chosen for the investigation of the TLR4 signaling pathway.
LPS induces AEG-1 expression in gastric cancer cells
To investigate whether the TLR4 signaling pathway was
involved in AEG-1 upregulation by LPS, we knocked down
TLR4 expression by siRNA. The efﬁciency of TLR4 downregulation by 3 TLR4-speciﬁc siRNAs was tested by RT-PCR and
immunoblotting (Fig. 2A and B). The effect of LPS on AEG-1
protein expression in gastric cancer cells was examined by
immunoblotting. When cells were stimulated with 100 ng/mL
of LPS for 0.5, 1, 2, and 3 hours, AEG-1 levels showed a timedependent increase up to 1 hour (Fig. 2C). When various LPS
concentrations were tested, AEG-1 was upregulated in a concentration-dependent manner up to 100 ng/mL (Fig. 2D). Of the
3 speciﬁc siRNAs, si-TLR4-2 was the most efﬁcient in downregulating TLR4 expression, which in turn signiﬁcantly reduced
the expression of AEG-1 in response to LPS induction (Fig. 2E).
Next, we investigated the involvement of different cell
signaling pathways in the regulation of the LPS-induced
AEG-1 expression. The effect of a series of pharmacologic
inhibitors, including those for mitogen-activated kinases p38
(SB203580), SAPK/JNK (SP600125), and MEK1/2 (U0126), and
NF-kB (PDTC), on the LPS-induced AEG-1 expression was
examined (Fig. 2F). Of all the inhibitors tested, only PDTC could
prevent the induction of AEG-1 expression by LPS.
AEG-1 augments TLR4 expression and activates NF-kB
Next, we investigated time- and concentration-dependent
effects of LPS on TLR4 expression in gastric cancer cells. When
TLR4 expression was examined 0.5, 1, 2, and 3 hours after
stimulation with 100 ng/mL LPS, it showed maximal increase
at 1 hour (Fig. 3A, left). Similar to AEG-1, TLR4 expression was
also upregulated by LPS in a concentration-dependent manner
up to 100 ng/mL (Fig. 3A, right).
To investigate the role of AEG-1 in the TLR4 signaling
pathway, we knocked down AEG-1 expression with 3 speciﬁc
siRNAs (Fig. 3B). AEG-1 downregulation by the most efﬁcient
siAEG-1-3 resulted in a signiﬁcant reduction of TLR4 response
to LPS stimulation (Fig. 3C).
Previous studies revealed that AEG-1 could activate the NFkB signaling pathway (16, 21, 23). Given that AEG-1 expression
in gastric cancer cells was induced by LPS (Fig. 2C–E), we next
tested whether AEG-1 regulated NF-kB activation in gastric
cancer cells. NF-kB–dependent luciferase activity was markedly decreased in the cells transfected with AEG-1–speciﬁc siRNA
(Fig. 3D), indicating that NF-kB signaling depended on AEG-1
expression.
In addition, AEG-1 downregulation negatively affected the
nuclear translocation of NF-kB (Fig. 3E). A strong nuclear signal
for the NF-kB subunit p65 observed in control (scrambled
siRNA-transfected) cells, was signiﬁcantly decreased in AEG-1
siRNA-expressing cells with a corresponding increase in the
cytoplasmic staining (Fig. 3E, left). The cytoplasmic localization

of p65 following AEG-1 knockdown was also conﬁrmed by
analyzing p65 levels in cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts by
immunoblotting (Fig. 3E, right). The levels of p65 protein
increased in the cytoplasm and decreased in the nuclei of gastric
cancer cells after AEG-1 knockdown, indicating that AEG-1
negatively regulated NF-kB activation in gastric cancer cells.
Next, we evaluated the expression of NF-kB downstream
genes IL6, IL8, matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP2), MMP9,
and VEGF following AEG-1 knockdown. A signiﬁcant decrease
in IL8 and MMP9 mRNA levels was detected in gastric cancer
cells transfected with si-AEG-1 compared with those transfected with scrambled siRNA (Fig. 3F).
AEG-1 regulates NF-kB signaling through a positive
feedback mechanism involving downregulation of
SOCS-1
Suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) proteins SOCS-1
and SOCS-3 are believed to play pivotal roles in inﬂammation
and in the development and progression of cancer. Previous
studies have shown that SOCS-1 and SOCS-3 can inhibit TLR4/
NF-kB signaling in a negative feedback loop pattern (24–26).
Upon translocation to the nucleus, SOCS-1 ubiquitin ligase
interacts with NF-kB subunit p65 and promotes its proteasomal degradation (27), thus terminating the expression of
NFkB-inducible genes. On the other hand, nuclear-translocated AEG-1 causes transcriptional activation of NF-kB target
genes (16). We hypothesized that in gastric cancer cells, AEG-1

5544

Cancer Res; 74(19) October 1, 2014

regulated TLR4/NF-kB signaling via SOCS proteins. To explore
this possibility, we examined SOCS-1 and SOCS-3 expression in
gastric cancer cells transfected with the V-AEG-1 plasmid. The
transfection efﬁciency exceeded 80% (Fig. 4A), and the expression of AEG-1 was conﬁrmed by RT-PCR and immunoblotting
(Fig. 4B). AEG-1 expression affected the level of SOCS-1 but not
that of SOCS-3 (data not shown). The effect of AEG-1 on SOCS-1
expression was further investigated in the gastric cancer cells
cotransfected with V-AEG-1 and V-SOCS-1 plasmids. Western
blot analysis showed that SOCS-1 protein levels were signiﬁcantly reduced in AEG-1–transfected cells, in contrast to
robust SOCS-1 expression observed in control MO2-transfected cells (Fig. 4D). Given that the AEG-1 and MO2 constructs
were based on the same plasmid, the effect on SOCS-1 expression was AEG-1 speciﬁc.
We suggested that AEG-1 overexpression promoted the
proteasomal degradation of SOCS-1. This hypothesis was
tested by treating the transfected gastric cancer cells for 48
hours with MG-132, a cell-permeable proteasome inhibitor.
The proteasomal inhibitor restored SOCS-1 protein expression
despite the presence of AEG-1 (Fig. 4E), suggesting that AEG-1–
promoted proteasomal degradation of the SOCS-1 protein.

the MTT assay revealed that compared with control cells
(vector), AEG-1- or/and TLR4–expressing cells had higher
proliferation (Fig. 5A) and colony-formation (Fig. 5B) rates.
In the Matrigel invasion assay, gastric cancer cells cotransfected with AEG-1 and TLR4 showed a markedly upregulated invasive ability compared with that of other groups
(Fig. 5C). Establishment of subcutaneous xenograft in the
ﬂanks of nude mice revealed that AEG-1/TLR4 coexpressing
cancer cells generated large aggressive tumors in 4 weeks
(Fig. 5D).
Increased expression of AEG-1 and TLR4 indicates poor
prognosis for gastric cancer
The expression of AEG-1, TLR4, SOCS-1, and NF-kB was
analyzed in the formalin-ﬁxed and parafﬁn-embedded gastric
mucosa tissues by immunohistochemistry. Compared with the

www.aacrjournals.org

matched normal gastric tissues, tumors showed high protein
expression of AEG-1, TLR4, and NF-kB, but not SOCS-1 (Fig.
6A). In the adjacent noncancerous tissues, expression of AEG-1,
TLR4, SOCS-1, and p65 was detected in 3 (15%), 5 (25%), 18
(90%), and 7 (35%) of 20 patients, respectively, whereas in
gastric tumors, expression of these proteins were observed in
63 (67.7%), 61 (65.6%), 45 (48.4%), and 66 (70.9%) of 93 patients
(P < 0.001, P ¼ 0.001, P ¼ 0.01, and P ¼ 0.02, respectively).
The association between AEG-1, TLR4, SOCS-1, and p65
expression and clinicopathologic features is shown in Table 1.
A signiﬁcant correlation was detected between AEG-1 expression and the depth of tumor invasion and UICC stage. A
signiﬁcant difference in histologic differentiation and UICC
stage was observed between the groups positive and negative
for TLR4 protein expression. Signiﬁcant differences in tumor
size, depth of tumor invasion, lymph node metastasis, distant
metastasis, and UICC stage were detected between the patients

0.038; Fig. 6B). Similarly, overall survival for the patients
positive and negative for TLR4 expression was 46.9 months
(95% CI, 38.9–54.9) and 60.5 months (95% CI, 50.5–70.5; P ¼
0.033), respectively (Fig. 6C). We next assessed the effects of
simultaneous expression of AEG-1 and TLR4 on overall
survival. As expected, overall survival for the AEG-1/TLR4–
positive patients was lower than that for AEG-1/TLR4–negative patients: 43.7 months (95% CI, 34.7–52.6) compared
with 69.1 months (95% CI, 60.0–78.1; P ¼ 0.033), respectively
(Fig. 6D).

Discussion
A strong association between chronic infection, inﬂammation, and cancer has been revealed by clinical and epidemiologic studies (28–30). The link between inﬂammation and
cellular malignant transformation was ﬁrst suggested by
Rudolf Virchow in the 19th century. Thus, a correlation has
been shown between gastric cancer and H. pylori infection,
colon cancer and inﬂammatory bowel disease, liver cancer and
chronic viral hepatitis, and cervical cancer and HPV infection
(28–30). These studies suggest that chronic inﬂammation plays
an important role in tumor initiation and progression (30). An
oncogenic protein AEG-1 is involved in cancer-related inﬂammation (31); however, the AEG-1–speciﬁc regulatory mechanisms are not well understood. Here, we show that LPS can
upregulate the expression of AEG-1, which in turn augments
the TLR4/NF-kB signaling pathway.
Although AEG-1 does not directly bind to DNA, upon TNFa
treatment it interacts with the NF-kB p65 subunit and cyclic
AMP-responsive element binding protein (CREB)–binding

protein (CBP) on the IL8 promoter, increasing IL8 transcription (32). IL8, an NF-kB downstream gene, positively regulates
angiogenesis and metastasis, whereas inhibition of NF-kB
abrogates AEG-1–induced augmentation of growth and invasion of HeLa cells (16). Gene chip analysis revealed that AEG-1
overexpression led to the upregulation of several NF-kB downstream genes, including cell adhesion factors ICAM-2 and
ICAM-3; selectin E, L, and P ligands; many other important
mediators of tumor malignancy, such as IL6, IL8, TLR4, and
TLR5; and transcription factors c-Jun and c-Fos (16). Consistent with these data, our study also demonstrated that AEG-1
knockdown could lead to the inactivation of NF-kB and downregulation of IL8 and MMP9. AEG-1 knockdown also blocked
LPS-induced TLR4 expression (Fig. 3), indicating the existence
of a positive feedback loop between AEG-1 and the TLR4/NFkB signaling pathway. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays
revealed that AEG-1 might bridge NF-kB, CBP, and basal
transcription machinery by functioning as a coactivator in
NF-kB–mediated transcription (32).
Toll-like receptors (TLR) play a key role in the innate
immune system (33). TLR4 was the ﬁrst discovered human
TLR activated by LPS of gram-negative bacteria (34). TLR4 is
expressed not only in immune cells but also in many tumors,

5548

including breast cancer (35) and colon and ovarian cancer (36)
where TLR4-related signaling can promote tumor growth and
immune escape (33, 37, 38). Here, we revealed strong association of TLR4 with gastric cancer by demonstrating higher
TLR4 expression in gastric cancer cell lines and gastric tumors
compared with normal gastric cells and noncancerous tissues
(Fig. 1). TLR4 stimulation with bacterial LPS has been shown to
promote tumor invasion and metastasis through NF-kB–
dependent upregulation of inducible nitric oxide synthase
(iNOS) and MMP2 (39). Moreover, TLR4 activation by LPS in
tumor cells induces the synthesis of various proinﬂammatory
soluble factors, including IL6, IL12, and iNOS, thus creating the
inﬂammatory microenvironment and promoting tumor
growth (38). Besides, H. pylori infection can actively induce
inﬂammation by upregulating TLR4 expression in gastric
epithelial cell lines, which in turn can be enhanced by other
bacteria and/or endotoxins in the gastrointestinal tract (40,
41). Our results also indicate that TLR4 expression can be
induced by LPS stimulation. After TLR4 knockdown, the LPSinduced AEG-1 expression diminished correspondingly and
the NF-kB inhibitor PDTC had a similar effect, indicating that
TLR4/NF-kB signaling can regulate AEG-1 expression (Fig. 2E
and F).

AEG-1 Promotes Gastric Cancer via TLR4/NF-kB

cancer positive for AEG-1 and
TLR4 expression have poor
prognosis. A, AEG-1, TLR4,

SOCS proteins, originally identiﬁed as negative-feedback
mediators of cytokine signaling, also play a key role in the
negative regulation of TLR signaling. SOCS proteins, especially
SOCS-1 and SOCS-3, are implicated in inﬂammation and in the
development and progression of cancers (42, 43). Previous
studies have shown that SOCS-1 and SOCS-3 inhibit TLR
signaling through the adaptor protein Mal, TNF receptor–
associated factors 3 and 6, and NF-kB (26, 44, 45). SOCS-1 is
the only member of the SOCS family that can interact with the
NF-kB p65 subunit, promoting its polyubiquitination and
proteasomal degradation and inhibiting NF-kB signaling
(27). On the other hand, AEG-1 interaction with p65 upregulates NF-kB pathway (16), although the mechanism remains
unknown. AEG-1 may regulate NF-kB signaling either by
binding to other coactivators such as CREB-binding protein
(CBP; ref. 32) or by decreasing NF-kB inhibitory protein IkB.
Our investigation showed that AEG-1 could downregulate

www.aacrjournals.org

SOCS-1 but not SOCS-3 (Fig. 4). Even though the function of
SOCS-1 in tumors is still a debatable matter, SOCS-1 is considered an important tumor suppressor in many malignancies,
including melanoma, breast, and prostate cancers (46). Here,
we have demonstrated that AEG-1 regulation of SOCS-1 protein underlies low expression of SOCS-1 in tumors. In this
context, AEG-1 can activate the TLR4/NF-kB pathway by
downregulating SOCS-1, an inhibitor of the TLR4/NF-kB signaling. In addition, AEG-1 might reduce SOCS-1 levels via the
ubiquitin–proteasome pathway (Fig. 4), thus providing a
potential mechanism for the posttranslational regulation of
SOCS-1 activity. AEG-1 affects mRNA processing and/or stability, which can also lead to decreased SOCS-1 protein levels.
This hypothesis requires further investigation.
The long-term consequence of H. pylori infection is gastric
cancer. The activation of NF-kB and upregulation of IL8 in
gastric epithelial cells have been suggested as critical

AEG-1 Promotes Gastric Cancer via TLR4/NF-kB

mechanisms responsible for H. pylori–induced chronic inﬂammation and gastric carcinogenesis (47). The expression of most
cancer biomarkers is driven by NF-kB–regulated genes (48).
For example, cancer-secreted IL8 can enhance the proliferation and survival of tumor cells via autocrine signaling pathways, whereas tumor-derived IL8 can promote the invasion
and migration of cancer cells and activate endothelial cells in
the tumor vasculature to enhance angiogenesis (48, 49). MMP9
can be an important modulator of tumor progression by
affecting processes critically involved in tumorigenesis and
cancer progression, including growth, survival, angiogenesis,
invasion, and regulation of the immune response (50). The
activated AEG-1/NF-kB feed-forward loop upregulates multiple cancer biomarkers and can signiﬁcantly inﬂuence cancer
progression. Our study demonstrates that AEG-1 potently
activates NF-kB signaling via regulation of TLR4 and SOCS1 and that AEG-1 and TLR4 coexpression can greatly enhance
the proliferation and malignancy of gastric cancer cells (Fig. 5).
Furthermore, our investigation of 93 patients with gastric
cancer reveals that the expression of AEG-1 correlates with
that of TLR4, SOCS-1, and NF-kB and together with that of
TLR4, indicate poor prognosis and decreased survival (Fig. 6).
Thus, AEG-1 can promote proinﬂammatory signaling via the
AEG-1/NF-kB feed-forward pathway and contribute to the
initiation, progression, malignant conversion, invasion, and
metastasis of gastric cancer (17).
In summary, we have demonstrated that in gastric cancer
cells, AEG-1, induced by LPS/TLR4/NF-kB signaling pathway,
can in turn augment NF-kB signaling by downregulating

SOCS-1 and promoting uncontrolled inﬂammation in tumor
microenvironment. AEG-1/NF-kB can form a feed-forward
loop to upregulate NF-kB target genes in an autocrine manner,
thus contributing to the progression of gastric cancer. Our
results contribute to a deeper understanding of the association
between AEG-1 and a sustained proinﬂammatory signaling in
gastric cancer and could have a signiﬁcant impact on both
prevention and treatment of the disease.
