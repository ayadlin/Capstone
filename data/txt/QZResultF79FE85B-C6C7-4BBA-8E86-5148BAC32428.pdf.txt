BACKGROUND. Chondrosarcoma (CS) is a rare and heterogeneous sarcoma in which, after failure of surgery and
radiotherapy, chemotherapy plays only a marginal role. Different molecular pathways have been shown to be activated in CS; in particular, both isoforms of platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) are expressed and phosphorylated. These observations prompted investigation of the activity of imatinib mesylate (IM) in patients with
advanced CS in a phase 2 trial. METHODS. Between January 2007 and June 2009, patients with metastatic, nonresectable CS were treated with 400 mg of IM administered twice daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Two criteria determined patient trial eligibility: 1 prior line of chemotherapy and immunohistochemical
expression of either PDGFR-a or PDGFR-b. The primary objective of the trial was objective response. As secondary
objectives, the authors selected progression-free survival (PFS) at 4 months, overall survival, and clinical benefit
(EUDRACT number 2006-006446-33). RESULTS. Twenty-six patients were enrolled and all demonstrated PDGFR
positivity and phosphorylation. No objective response was demonstrated. The 4-month PFS rate was 31% (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 16%-53%). The median overall survival was 11 months (95% CI, 6 months-15 months). Neither
long-lasting freedom from disease progression nor clinical benefit was observed. The IM dose was temporarily
reduced in 60%15 of the patients because of toxicity. CONCLUSIONS. IM was found to be relatively well-tolerated, but
failed to demonstrate meaningful clinical activity in terms of both objective response and freedom from disease progression. Advanced CS remains an incurable disease, and effective targeted therapies are still awaited. Cancer

Chondrosarcomas (CS) are a rare and heterogeneous family of mesenchymal tumors characterized by the pro-

duction of cartilaginous tissue.1 As of 2010, the group has been further characterized into different histological subtypes
based on several features: 1) morphology (white cell, mesenchymal, and grading); 2) chromosomal translocations (myxoid); 3) simultaneous presence of various mesenchymal lineages of differentiation (dedifferentiated form); and 4) site of
origin within/outside the bone (osseous and extraosseous). Surgery is the mainstay of treatment of CS, with the aim of
wide surgical margins.2 In selected cases, radiotherapy may achieve encouraging results when adequate doses are delivered
by conformational techniques or proton beam/carbon ion radiotherapy.3,4 In general, chemotherapy has a marginal role,
if any, except in the case of mesenchymal chondrosarcoma.5 Indeed, international guidelines either fail to suggest or point

out the minimal effectiveness of medical therapy. Therefore, nonresectable primary presentation (eg, spine localization) and the development of distant metastases are
almost invariably fatal events.6
However, in the last decade, the molecular pathways
involved in CS biology and progression have been extensively studied and have revealed new information for therapeutic approaches. Pivotal studies have shown tyrosine
kinase receptors are involved in tumor aggressiveness.
Both the alpha (a) and beta (b) isoforms of plateletderived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) were found to
be correlated with prognosis.7,8 PDGFR-a, PDGFR-b,
and their cognates were identified in CS tissue samples,
which confirmed pathway activation.9 Imatinib mesylate
(IM) is a small molecule, acting as a highly selective inhibitor of some protein tyrosine kinases, including the chimeric BCR-ABL fusion protein found in certain
leukemias such as chronic myeloid leukemia; PDGFR-a
and PDGFRb; and KIT, the receptor for the stem cell factor. Targeted therapies and IM have been among the
greatest breakthroughs of the last decade and gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) have provided a paradigm on
how to effectively develop targeted therapies.10 IM was
later demonstrated to be active in other mesenchymal
tumors (dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans and chordoma) in addition to GIST,10-12 because they too involve
activation of the PDGF/PDGFR pathway. These findings
substantiated that selective inhibition of PDGFR may
also halt disease progression in pathologies formerly without effective medical therapy, and prompted us to prospectively explore the activity of IM in patients with
advanced CS after standard therapy failure.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
The current study was a nonrandomized, multicenter,
open-label phase 2 trial in patients with histologically proven CS with nonresectable or metastatic disease. In all
patients, the histological diagnosis was centrally reviewed
and PDGFR expression was confirmed by immunohistochemical staining. Immunostaining was performed on 4um thick tissue sections after antigen retrieval by immersion in 0.01 M of citrate buffer (pH 6.0) for 40 minutes.
Incubation with the primary PDGFR-a polyclonal antibody (Lab Vision/NeoMarkers, Lab Vision Corporation,
Fremont, Calif) and/or PDGFR-b rabbit polyclonal antibody (Thermo Scientific, Fremont, Calif) were performed
for 60 minutes at dilutions of 1:150 and 1:25, respec-

tively. Detection was made using the Envision system
(Dakocytomation Inc, Carpinteria, Calif), a polymerbased, biotin-free detection system, for 30 minutes followed by the chromogen 3,3-diaminobenzidine for 10
minutes. The presence of membranous and/or cytoplasmic immunostaining was determined semiquantitatively
(ie, <30%, 30%-60%, and >60% positive tumor cells
were graded as 1, 2 or 3, respectively). All patients were
aged 18 years and had received at least 1 line of chemotherapy that was completed >4 weeks before trial entry.
In addition, any radiotherapy had to be completed >1
month before trial entry. Patients were required to have a
life expectancy of 3 months and an Eastern Cooperative
Oncology Group performance status <3.
Treatment Schedule and Evaluation
All patients received IM at a dose of 400 mg twice a day.
According to toxicity, the dose could be reduced or temporarily suspended until recovery from the observed
adverse event/s. Therapy was resumed at the maximum
tolerated dose according to the physician’s decision.
Before the initiation of treatment, all patients were
staged using computed tomography scans of the chest and
abdomen, magnetic resonance imaging (if limb lesions
were involved), full blood count and serum chemistry,
electrocardiogram, and physical examination. All tests
were repeated after 2 months and at 3-month intervals
thereafter until disease progression or unexpected toxicity
occurred. Toxicity was assessed according to the National
Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for
Adverse Events (version 3.0).13 Treatment was continued
until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
Outcome Evaluation
Response was assessed according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) (version 1.0).14
According to these criteria, complete response (CR) and
partial response (PR) required confirmation within 4
weeks after a response was first demonstrated whereas stable disease (SD) required confirmation within 8 weeks.
Nondimensional patterns of tumor response were thoroughly examined in each patient by checking for changes
in density and/or contrast medium uptake in target as well
as nontarget lesions.15
Progression-free survival (PFS) was computed from
the first date of study treatment to the date of documented
disease progression according to RECIST or to the date of
death from any cause, whichever came first. Survival was
computed from the first date of treatment to the date of

Statistical Analysis
We designed this exploratory trial to detect clinically significant activity of IM in an ‘‘orphan’’ disease for which,
to the best of our knowledge, no trials had been conducted
in 20 years. Bearing in mind this framework, any predefined level of activity for a null hypothesis, as well as for a
hypothesis of interest, would have been completely arbitrary and, as such, a mere statistical trick. Therefore, we
selected as a primary endpoint objective response and, as a
secondary endpoint, and above all, PFS, under the hypothesis that any shrinkage or prolonged stability should
be regarded as a treatment success. To mitigate the potential that CS heterogeneity might jeopardize the observed
results, we deliberately chose a relatively large sample (25
patients) to detect any activity in terms of objective
response. Such an approach would maximize the detection of differential activity within the main subentities
that comprise the CS family of tumors. At the same time,
we turned to secondary endpoints (PFS, survival, and

BPI) to identify any other drug effect on the disease. Notwithstanding the previously mentioned limitations to setting precise statistical parameters, we calculated the
sample size according to a 2-stage design: we assumed an
expected response rate of 10% from a second-line chemotherapy and an activity of IM of 30%. Therefore, if no
responses had been detected in the first 25 patients with
type I and type II error rates set at 0.05 and 0.10, respectively, then the probability of having an active drug would
have had to have been <10%.17 All patients who received
at least 1 dose of IM were included in an intention-totreat analysis and the results of treatment were expressed
as a response rate with a 95% confidence interval (95%
CI). PFS and overall survival were estimated according to
the Kaplan-Meier method.

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
Between January 2007 and June 2009, 26 patients diagnosed with metastatic and/or nonresectable CS were enrolled at 6 centers. All patients had received at least 1 prior
line of chemotherapy and their median age was 61 years
(range, 23-81 years). We included 16 patients diagnosed
with conventional CS and 10 patients diagnosed with
bone CS with prominent myxoid features (CSm). All 26
enrolled patients demonstrated immunohistochemical

Study Treatment
Of the 26 patients screened to enter into the study, all had
IM initiated at a dose of 400 mg twice a day and were
included in the analysis for toxicity and response. No
patients had to permanently discontinue treatment
because of side effects. The median dose administered of
imatinib was 83% (range, 74%-91%) of that expected.
Response to IM
We did not observe any CRs or PRs by either dimensional
criteria (RECIST) or nondimensional criteria. Among the
26 patients, there were 8 (31%) with SD and 18 (69%)
with progressive disease. The median PFS was 3 months
(95% CI, 2.2 months-7.7 months) (Fig. 1). The PFS rate
at 4 months was 31% (95% CI, 16%-53%). The median
overall survival was 11 months (95% CI, 6 months-15
months) (Fig. 2) and 10 (39%) patients remained alive at 1
year of follow-up. Objective response, PFS, and overall survival did not differ between patients with conventional CS
and those with CSm (Table 2). Among those patients who
achieved SD, we did not observe any long-lasting freedom
from disease progression. We were unable to demonstrate

Cancer

any trend in favor of patients with membranous PDFGRpositive staining. Finally, BPI was assessable in 24 of the 26
patients. We could not demonstrate any significant clinical
benefit in patients, even among those who achieved SD
(defined as a mean basal BPI of 4.2 compared with a mean
best response BPI of 4.8; P ¼ .18).
Toxicity
In general, IM was relatively well tolerated by CS patients as
a second-line therapy at a dose of 800 mg per day. Adverse
events were observed in 18 (69%) patients, and dose reductions were required in 15 (58%) patients. We did not
observe any drug-related deaths. Edema was the most common grade 3 to 4 toxicity, and was noted in 3 (12%)
patients, followed by skin rash in 2 (8%) patients, leukopenia in 2 (8%) patients, and muscle cramps in 1 (4%)
patient. As expected, the observed side effects were reversible either with dose reductions or short drug interruptions.

DISCUSSION
Although patients with CS have benefited from improvements in both surgical and radiotherapy techniques, as of
2010, systemic therapies still failed to control the disease
in the advanced phase. Indeed, chemotherapy has demonstrated some activity in specific CS subtypes only, among
them mesenchymal and dedifferentiated CS.18,19 Recent
insights into CS biology8,9 have shed some light on the
mechanisms behind the proliferative advantage of this tumor and generated the hypothesis that a potential CS

829

Original Article

therapy may lay in targeting the PDGFR pathway. In fact,
PDGFR has already been successfully targeted by IM in
other mesenchymal tumors.10-12,20 Moreover, in the current study, we prospectively demonstrated that in all
treated patients, PDGFR was phosphorylated, suggesting
its activation, which strengthened the initial hypothesis.
However, this multicenter clinical trial failed to demonstrate clinically significant activity of IM in patients with
CS. Because drug activity may display different patterns
of response, we prospectively collected different endpoints
beyond standard objective response as a clinical benefit by
means of BPI, a validated tool. This not withstanding, we
were unable to demonstrate IM activity using any of the
selected endpoints.
It is well known that the expression of a target is a
necessary, but not sufficient, condition to elicit a response
to targeted therapies.21 The failure to demonstrate an
improvement with this small inhibitor might be because
of several reasons. As Lagonigro et al9 indicated, no
PDGFR mutations were shown in their series. However,
these data may only partially explain the inactivity of the
drug because even if chordoma does not display PDGFR
mutations, IM has been shown to be active.22 More likely,
other molecular mechanisms are responsible for IM failure. The best available model for the molecular mechanisms driving response or resistance to targeted therapies,
namely activation of downstream effectors23 or alternative
growth factor transduced activation,24 remains that demonstrated for GIST.
Moreover, in GIST, the likelihood of developing resistance to tyrosine kinase receptor (TKR) inhibitors
depends not only on specific KIT and PDGFR-a mutations but also on the accumulation of chromosomal
abnormalities.25 Recent data26 have demonstrated that
CS harbor genomic unbalances in 90% of cases with some
recurrent amplifications and homozygous deletions.
These observations raise the suspicion of a sarcoma that is
too complex to be controlled by shutting off only 1 of its
driving mechanisms.
Despite the lack of activity shown by IM, the results
of the current study indicate 2 potential lines of therapy for
future study. The first centers on whether the combination
of IM and a chemotherapeutic agent with low to moderate
activity, such as doxorubicin, might enhance the effectiveness of both drugs, as observed when patients with GIST
fail IM therapy.27 In the absence of other treatment strategies, this combination might deserve further attention.
The second hypothesis, recently suggested by Schrage et
al,28,;29 proposes that the multikinase inhibitor dasatinib

830

and the cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 inhibitor celecoxib might
be appropriate because of activation of relevant CS pathways. Finally, other approaches that will need to be considered in the future rely on the blockade of other pathways
known to be important in chondrogenesis, such hedgehog
signaling, which is in a negative feedback loop with parathyroid hormone-related protein.30
In summary, as expected, IM was found to be relatively well tolerated but was inactive in terms of both freedom from disease progression and tumor shrinkage.
Advanced CS still remains an incurable disease for which
targeted therapies must be pursued to overcome its chemoresistance and improve the stagnant dismal prognosis
of this tumor.
