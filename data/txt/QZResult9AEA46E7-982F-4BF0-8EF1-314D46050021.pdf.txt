Abstract
Several studies have shown how pentacyclic triterpenes can
inhibit proliferation and induce apoptosis of some tumor cell
lines; however, its effect on astrocytic tumors, one of the most
malignant forms of cancer, has rarely been reported. The aim
of this study was to examine how the pentacyclic triterpenes,
oleanolic acid and maslinic acid, isolated from olive juice,
affected astrocytoma cell morphology and survival. Cell
proliferation was inhibited in 1321N1 astrocytoma cells by
using 1 to 50 Mmol/L of either oleanolic acid or maslinic acid,
with an average IC50 of 25 Mmol/L. Growth inhibition led to
morphologic and cytoskeletal alterations associated with the
loss of stellate morphology and characterized by a retraction
of the cytoplasm and collapse of actin stress fibers. Using 4¶,6diamidino-2-phenylindole and Annexin V, we showed that
astrocytoma cell death induced by oleanolic acid or maslinic
acid were mainly due to apoptotic events. Furthermore, we
showed that caspase-3 is activated as a consequence of
triterpene treatment. Finally, we found that exposure of the
cells to oleanolic acid or maslinic acid resulted in a significant
increase of intracellular reactive oxygen species, followed by
loss of mitochondrial membrane integrity. Importantly,
enzymatic scavengers, such as catalase, or phenolic antioxidants, such as butylated hydroxytoluene, rescued cells from
the triterpene-mediated apoptosis, suggesting that the potential therapeutic effect of these acidic triterpenes is dependent
on oxidative stress. Our data show that acidic triterpenes play
a major role in 1321N1 astrocytoma morphology and viability
and support the conclusion that oleanolic acid and maslinic
acid may thus be promising new agents in the management of
astrocytomas. [Cancer Res 2007;67(8):3741–51]

Introduction
Malignant astrocytic tumors are the most common primary
brain tumors; their growth is rapid and they are associated with a
poor prognosis, despite the use of multimodal treatment regimens.
The lack of progress in the treatment of this cancer has urged the
identification of novel agents.
The growth rate of tumors is dependent both on the rate of
proliferation and on the rate of cell loss (1). Cell loss may occur
either because of apoptosis or necrosis. Necrotic cell death is
characterized by membrane damage, and it generates an inflam-

matory response (2). Apoptosis, the intrinsic suicide program of
the cell, is a process associated with nuclear and cytosolic
condensation and the formation of apoptotic bodies (3). Mammalian cell apoptosis requires the triggering of complex regulatory
pathways that include effectors, inhibitors, and activators (4, 5).
This process often involves a family of proteases known as
caspases, which are activated in a proteolytic cascade to cleave
specific substrates (6–8). The intrinsic pathway is generated by
multiple signals, including heat shock, lymphokine deprivation,
radiation, and chemotherapy (9, 10). Even oxidative stress has also
been suggested to play a role as a common mediator of apoptosis
(11). This apoptotic route involves the mitochondria-dependent
activation of initiator caspases, which in turn activate downstream
executive caspases, such as caspase-3 (12, 13). The extrinsic death
receptor pathway is triggered by death ligands through the
formation of the death-inducing signaling complex. This complex
results in caspase-8 activation, which initiates the downstream
apoptotic signaling (14–16).
The aggressive cancer cell phenotype is the result of a variety of
alterations leading to deregulation of these intracellular signaling
pathways (17, 18). Thus, current attempts to improve cancer
survival will have to include strategies that specifically target tumor
cell resistance to apoptosis. In recent years, the development of
more effective and safer agents has been intensively required for
chemoprevention of human cancer, and natural products from
plants and their synthetic derivatives have been expected to play an
important role in creating new and better chemopreventive and
therapeutic agents.
Herbal medicines derived from plant extracts are being
increasingly used to treat a wide variety of clinical diseases, with
relative little knowledge of their modes of action. The triterpenoids,
biosynthesized in plants by the cyclization of squalene, are found
widely distributed throughout the vegetable kingdom and are the
major components of many medicinal plants used in Asian
countries. There is a growing interest in the elucidation of the
biological and pharmacologic roles of the plant-derived triterpenoid compounds, in terms of hepatoprotectory, analgesic, antitumor, antiinflammatory, and immunomodulatory effects (19, 20).
In this study, we focus on two pentacyclic triterpenes, oleanolic
acid (3b-hydroxy-12-oleanen-28-oic acid) and maslinic acid (2a,3bdihydroxy-12-oleanen-28-oic acid), which are present in plants,
such as Olea europaea, and can be isolated in appreciable amounts
from the nonglyceride fraction of pomace olive oil. To our knowledge, the potential therapeutic significance of this olive subproduct has not yet been completely studied. It has been reported that
oleanolic acid produces a wide variety of excellent antitumorpromoting activity in the in vivo carcinogenesis test, including
decrease of the incidence of induced intestinal tumor in a rat
model (21), inhibition of angiogenesis, which is important for
the progressive growth of solid tumors (22), tumor promotion (23),

and implanted tumor growth in mice (24). However, in spite of
these pleiotropic effects, the exact mechanisms by which natural
oleananes promote such cellular outcomes are not well understood
and the biochemical basis of these actions remains to be
determined.
Our interest in both oleanolic and maslinic acid as anticarcinogenic agents arises from their cytotoxic properties on different
human tumor cell lines and from their ability to inhibit tumor
promotion as mentioned earlier in experiments in vivo and in vitro.
Although diverse mechanisms have been proposed for the antitumor effects of these oleanane triterpenoids, information on the
molecular effect in brain cancer cells is not available. Therefore, the
purpose of this study was to determine the effect of the triterpenoids
found in pomace olive oil, oleanolic acid, and maslinic acid on
proliferation and apoptosis in the human astrocytoma cellular
line1321N1. We now report for the first time a study showing that
both oleanolic acid and maslinic acid are powerful molecules that
inhibit the proliferative capacity of human 1321N1 cells in culture.
Moreover, both triterpenes at a range of 5 to 25 Amol/L cause
apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. Hence, these natural agents
may represent an effective therapeutic strategy in the treatment
of human brain cancer. The underlying mechanism implicated in
their apoptotic responses was also preliminarily investigated, by
using different experimental protocols.

Materials and Methods
Reagents and antibodies. 4¶,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI), propidium iodide, N-acetylcysteine (NAC), butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT),
catalase, DTT, 1,3-dimethyl-2-thiourea (DMTU), rhodamine 123, and
chemicals were obtained from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). 2¶,7¶-Dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA), 4-amino-5-methylamino-2¶,7¶-difluorofluorescein (DAF-FM), and JC-1 were purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene,
OR), and human thrombin was obtained from Preprotech (Rocky Hill, NJ).
[3H]thymidine was from Amersham Biosciences (Little Chalfont, United
Kingdom).
Cell lines and cultures. The human astrocytoma cell lines 1321N1,
U87 MG (U87), U181 MG (U181), and U373 MG (U373) are four wellcharacterized permanent astrocytoma cell lines derived from patients
with malignant astrocytomas and were kindly supplied by Dr. J.H.
Brown (University of California San Diego, San Diego, CA), Dr. M. Guzman,
(Universidad Complutense de Madrid, Madrid, Spain), and Dr. M. Izquierdo
(Universidad Autonoma de Madrid, Madrid, Spain).
The astrocytoma cell lines were cultured in DMEM supplemented with
10% FCS, 100 units/mL penicillin, and 100 mg/mL streptomycin at 37jC in
5% CO2.
Extraction of pentacyclic triterpene acids from olives. Oleanolic acid
and maslinic acid, natural pentacyclic triterpenes, derivative from pressed
olive (O. europaea) fruits, were obtained by using the method described by
Juan et al. (25). The crude extract was chromatographed on a silica gel column
to separate maslinic and oleanolic acids, which were eluted with CHCl3. The
chloroform fraction was evaporated in a rotary evaporator and the extract
was kept as a powder. Triterpenes were dissolved at 25 mmol/L in DMSO.
Cell cycle analysis. Cells were seeded at the density of 5  105 in 25-cm2
plastic tissue culture flasks. After 24 h, the cells were treated with or without
different doses of triterpenes for 18 h. They were then washed in PBS and
resuspended in cold 70% ethanol. Cells were subjected to flow cytometric
analysis on an EPICS XL cytofluorimeter (Beckman Coulter, Spain) after
propidium iodide labeling, and the results were analyzed using CELL
QuestV1software.
Cell proliferation. Cell proliferation was evaluated by a [3H]thymidine
incorporation assay. Cells were plated onto six-well cell culture plates at
5  106/well. Before treatment, the cells were switched to serum-free
medium for a 24-h starvation period. Then, cells were treated with 5% FCS or

0.5 unit/mL thrombin in the presence of 0, 1, 5, 25, or 50 Amol/L oleanolic acid
or maslinic acid. After an overnight incubation, the proliferative response was
measured by supplementing the cultures with 1 ACi/well of [3H]thymidine for
4 additional hours. Then, cells were washed and DNA was precipitated and
analyzed by liquid scintillation counting. Results are expressed as the
percentage of [3H]thymidine uptake by either FCS- or Th-stimulated 1321N1
cells, respectively, in the absence of triterpenes. Numerical data are mean F
SD of four different experiments, each done in triplicate.
Assays for reactive oxygen species and reactive nitrogen species
production, and mitochondrial inner transmembrane potential
(#W m). To monitor the intracellular production of reactive oxygen species
(ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS), we used the cell-permeable
probes DCFH-DA and DAF-FM diacetate. Briefly, cells in 25-cm2 plastic
tissue culture flasks were treated for 30 min with 1 Amol/L DCFH-DA or
DAF-FM and stimulated 30 and 60 min with 25 Amol/L oleanolic acid,
maslinic acid, or Me2SO. Then, cells were harvested, washed, resuspended
in 1 mL of PBS at 37jC, and analyzed immediately by flow cytometry
(EPICS XL cytofluorimeter, Beckman Coulter). In some experiments, cells
were treated for 30 min with the indicated antioxidant before incubation
with the triterpenes.
The cationic dyes JC-1 and rhodamine 123 were used as probes to
evaluate mitochondrial transmembrane potential (DW m). Cells in 25-cm2
plastic tissue culture flasks were treated with 25 Amol/L oleanolic acid,
maslinic acid, or Me2SO for 6 or 18 h. Then, the cells were harvested, and
JC-1 or rhodamine 123 were added directly to the culture medium to a final
concentration of 60 and 150 nmol/L, respectively. Cells were harvested,
resuspended in 1 mL of PBS at 37jC, and analyzed immediately for
fluorescence intensity by flow cytometry or fluorescence microscopy.
Fluorescence microscopy. Astrocytes growing on 16-mm glass coverslips were used for immunofluorescence analysis. After triterpenoid
treatment, cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS and then
permeabilized in PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100. For filamentous (F)actin labeling, cells were incubated with FITC-phalloidin (1:200) at 37jC in
the dark for 30 min. Intermediate filaments were stained with antivimentin
(1:100) followed by incubation with Alexa 546–conjugated goat antimouse IgG antibody (1:200). Cellular nuclei were detected by incubation
with 1 mg/mL DAPI in the dark for 5 min. Apoptosis was also analyzed by
using the Annexin V binding assay. Cells were labeled with R-phycoerythrin–conjugated Annexin V according to the manufacturer’s protocol. After
these treatments, cells were washed with PBS and images were captured
with either a Nikon Eclipse TS100 or a Nikon Eclipse 80i inverted
fluorescence microscope using 20, 40, or 60 objective lens.
Western blots. To measure actin by Western blot, cell lysates were
subjected to electrophoresis in SDS-PAGE 10% polyacrylamide gels; proteins
were transferred to a membrane and probed with a mouse monoclonal
antiactin antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA)
followed by incubation with an HRP-linked secondary antibody. Signals
were detected using the enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham
Pharmacia Biotech). The membrane was stained with Ponceau S to confirm
equal loading and transfer of protein.
Flow cytometric analysis of apoptotic cells. After exposure to the
indicated doses of oleanolic acid or maslinic acid for 18 h, the percentage of
apoptotic cell death was determined using an Annexin V–phycoerythrin
Apoptosis Detection Assay. Briefly, cells (1  105/0.5 mL binding buffer)
were incubated with R-phycoerythrin–conjugated Annexin V for 5 min,
followed by flow cytometric analysis using an EPICS XL cytofluorimeter
(Beckman Coulter). In some experiments, cells were treated for 30 min with
the indicated antioxidant before incubation with the triterpenes.
The presence of processed caspase-3 was used as marker of apoptosis.
The active form of caspase-3 was measured by flow cytometry using FITCconjugated polyclonal antihuman-active caspase-3 antibody (C92-605, BD
PharMingen, San Diego, CA), which specifically recognizes cleaved activated
caspase-3 but not inactive pro-caspase-3. Astrocytoma cells were washed,
fixed, and permeabilized using 4% paraformaldehyde-0.1% Tween
20. Thereafter, cells were incubated with 20 AL of FITC-conjugated
polyclonal anti–active caspase-3 antibody or the isotype control antibody,
and analyzed by flow cytometry.

Triterpenes in Astrocytoma Cells

Results
Antiproliferative effects of the oleanolic and maslinic acid.
To observe the effect of the pentacyclic triterpenes, oleanolic acid
and maslinic acid, on astrocytoma cells, we used various
concentrations of the triterpenes for stimulation. The 1321N1 cells
were incubated with different concentrations of oleanolic acid or
maslinic acid (1, 5, 25, and 50 Amol/L) for 24 h in the presence of
5% FCS or 0.5 units/mL Th, and cell growth was studied by
measuring [3H]thymidine incorporation. We found that both
triterpenes inhibited cell proliferation in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 1A and B). The extent of oleanolic acid– and
maslinic acid–induced growth inhibition was approximately equal
in the FCS- and in the Th-stimulated cells, and the dose of
triterpenes required for growth inhibition did not differ significantly between the proliferative agents tested. The IC50 of these
compounds obtained after 24 h of incubation were around
25 Amol/L.
In addition, cell morphology was also examined using a phasecontrast microscope. Microscopic observations revealed that
triterpenes affect not only cell proliferation but also cell
appearance and attachment (Fig. 1C). Exposure of 1321N1 cells
to 25 Amol/L oleanolic acid or maslinic acid provoked dramatic
morphologic alterations in the cells: from flat, polygonal shape to a
stellate morphology. Mild morphologic changes were already
apparent at 30-min incubation with 25 Amol/L oleanolic acid or
maslinic acid (data not shown). At 2 h, shape change was almost
completed: many astrocytoma-treated cells acquired a round shape
with long cell processes and spindle-like structures. These
morphologic changes occurred as a result of retraction of the
cytoplasm around cytoskeletal elements as well as elongation of
processes. At 6 h of incubation with the triterpenes, the number of
cells attached to the coverslip had dramatically decreased, mostly
cells rounded up and individual processes continued to elongate.
The tendency of 1321N1 astrocytoma-treated cells to retreat
from and lose contact with culture plaques suggested that both
acidic triterpenes may cause defects in cell adhesion and spreading.
In fact, long treatment with 25 Amol/L oleanolic acid or maslinic
acid caused substantial cell detachment from the culture surface.
Cytoskeleton alterations following acidic triterpene exposure. To examine the molecular basis of this phenomenon, the
organization of the F-actin and the distribution of the vimentin
were analyzed because these two types of cytoskeletal elements
frequently work together to enhance both structural integrity and
cell shape. Therefore, 1321N1 cells were stained to visualize
cytoplasmic F-actin and vimentin. Treatment of quiescent cells
with 25 Amol/L oleanolic acid or maslinic acid causes dramatic
changes in the F-actin pattern. As shown in Fig. 2, untreated
astrocytoma cells showed normal morphology with actin spread
out throughout the cell and concentrated mainly in the cell cortex
(Fig. 2A). Upon treatment with either oleanolic acid or maslinic
acid, cells rounded up and the net of actin fibers, observed in
control cells, disappeared. The effect on F-actin distribution could
already be observed after 3 h treatment, where the fine linear
strands of actin seen in untreated cells were disrupted, and instead
astrocytes displayed a spindle-like appearance with actin condensed in the cell body, showing a compact F-actin network.
Immunostaining for vimentin, an intermediate filament protein,
showed high expression in resting 1321N1 astrocytoma cells
(Fig. 2A). In untreated cells, vimentin appeared as an elaborate
filamentous network surrounding the nucleus throughout the
cytoplasm; however, after triterpene treatment, the distribution of

www.aacrjournals.org

vimentin labeling revealed high density staining on the cytoplasm,
extending towards the cell periphery as filament bands.
These results indicate that oleanolic acid and maslinic acid
affect the cytoskeleton arrangement of cultured human astrocytoma cells. To provide a better quantitative approach to changes in
cellular F-actin, cells stained with phalloidin-FITC were analyzed
by flow cytometry. Acidic triterpenes decreased the amount of
F-actin, as we found a reduction in the number of cells with high
phalloidin-FITC fluorescence and there was an increase in the
number of cells with low F-actin staining (Fig. 2B). To determine
whether acidic triterpenes also affect cellular actin, lysates from
treated cells were subjected to electrophoresis and Western blot
analysis. As shown in Fig. 2C, there was no change in total cellular
actin after oleanolic acid or maslinic acid incubation. Thus, the
effect of triterpenes was presumably associated with a disruption
of actin filaments, as there was no modification in total cellular
actin with oleanolic acid or maslinic acid treatment.
Induction of apoptosis by oleanolic and maslinic acid. To
investigate whether these alterations in cell morphology were an
effect due to apoptosis, in cells treated with different times and
doses of oleanolic acid and maslinic acid, we analyzed various
apoptotic hallmarks, including DNA status, phosphatidylserine
exposure, and caspase-3 activation.
Flow cytometry assay after propidium iodide staining allows cell
cycle analysis, and cells undergoing apoptosis can be detected as a
subdiploid peak. The results observed using this technique revealed
that after 18 h of 5, 25, and 50 Amol/L triterpene treatment, the
population of 1321N1 astrocytes detected in the sub–G0-G1 peak
increased substantially (Fig. 3A). At the IC50 value, 25 Amol/L for
oleanolic acid or 25 Amol/L for maslinic acid, the hypodiploid region
included f32% and 20%, respectively, of the total events.
Consistently, nuclear staining with DAPI revealed chromatin
condensation and nuclear fragmentation in the triterpene-treated
cells at the same concentrations that inhibited cell growth (Fig. 3B).
In addition, Annexin V assay revealed that cells stained positive
with Annexin V–phycoerythrin after triterpene treatment. This
effect was observed already with a relatively low dose of triterpenes
and in a dose-dependent manner. The treated cells exhibited signs
of phosphatidylserine exposure and the percentages of apoptotic
cells are shown in Fig. 3C. Significant increase in Annexin V–
positive cells was also observed by fluorescence microscopy.
Astrocytes incubated with oleanolic acid or maslinic acid showed a
clear membrane staining, whereas control cells do not yield
positive labeling.
These results were in agreement with the presence of caspase-3
proteolytically processed, measured by flow cytometry in permeabilized cells using an antibody against the active fragment (Fig. 3D).
In fact, although untreated cells were primarily negative for the
presence of active caspase-3, the cells incubated with these
triterpenes at their IC50 values for 6 and 18 h had detectable levels
of the active form. In the 1321N1-treated cells, a modest increase in
active caspase-3 was observed at 6 h, whereas after 18 h the number
of cells expressing processed or active caspase-3, compared with
untreated control cells, was significantly higher (control cells, 3.5 +
1.5%; oleanolic acid–treated cells, 28.5 + 7.2%; maslinic acid–treated
cells, 14 + 4%). The magnitude of active caspase-3–positive cells was
similar to that induced by Fas (19 + 5%; not shown), a classic inducer
of apoptosis and caspase-3 activator.
These results indicate that, despite the chemical differences
between these two triterpenes, both showed similar efficacy in
inhibiting the viability of astrocytoma cells.

Triterpenes modulate ROS production and mitochondrial
membrane potential (#W m) collapse in 1321N1 cells. Several
studies have shown that certain apoptotic drugs trigger a rapid
production of intracellular ROS or RNS, which might be responsible
for their cytotoxic actions (26, 27). To determine whether oxidative
stress was possibly associated with oleanolic acid– or maslinic
acid–induced apoptosis, we exposed 1321N1 cells to 25 Amol/L
oleanolic acid or maslinic acid for 30 min and 1 h and examined
them for evidence of ROS/NOS production using the oxidative
stress–sensitive dyes DCFH-DA and DAF-FM. The results obtained

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (8). April 15, 2007

indicated that cell exposure to the acidic triterpenes, oleanolic acid
or maslinic acid, led to a remarkable increase in DCF fluorescence
at 30 min, whereas DAF-FM oxidation was not affected by any
compound (Fig. 4A). The shift to the right of the curve due to
increased fluorescence indicates an increase in the intracellular
levels of ROS. No additional increase in ROS buildup was found
at 1 h of triterpene incubation (data not shown).
It has been suggested that ROS overproduction leads to
mitochondrial damage that results in the loss of mitochondrial
membrane potential and dysfunction. Moreover, alterations in

mitochondrial function have been shown to play a crucial role in
apoptosis. Therefore, the ability of mitochondria to maintain
membrane potential after incubation with acidic triterpenes was
measured in 1321N1 cells using the fluorescent dyes rhodamine 123
and JC-1.
Rhodamine 123 is recognized as a specific fluorescent probe to
monitor active mitochondria. Its uptake and retention into the

mitochondrial matrix depends on the DW m. The fluorescence of Rh
123 in 1321N1 cells after 6 h treatment with 25 Amol/L oleanolic
acid or maslinic acid compared with untreated control was found
to be substantially reduced. Figure 4B shows that both oleanolic
acid and maslinic acid treatments caused a significant decrease on
fluorescence; it dropped to 116.5 F 13.5 and 349 F 33, respectively,
compared with 698 F 31 in untreated control cells. Under

extensively with rhodamine 123, whereas the triterpene-treated
cells were less stained or not stained at all (Fig. 4B).
JC-1 is a mitochondrial-selective sensor and aggregates in
normal and highly polarized mitochondria, resulting in a greenorange emission of 590 nm after excitation at 490 nm. Upon
depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane, JC-1 forms green
fluorescent monomers; therefore, the loss of JC-1 aggregates
directly correlates to changes of DW m. Figure 4C shows a clear
decrease in the percentage of cells that emitted orange
fluorescence after triterpene treatment compared with untreated
cells.
These results reflected the collapse of mitochondrial membrane
potential in 1321N1 cells after triterpene treatment.

Triterpene-induced apoptosis involves ROS formation in
1321N1 cells. To elucidate whether oxidative stress participates in
the oleanolic acid– or maslinic acid–induced apoptosis, 1321N1
cells were pretreated with different antioxidants, on the basis of
their scavenging capabilities. We examined the effect of scavenger
enzymes, such as catalase, disulfide-reducing agents, such as NAC,
and hydroxyl radical scavengers, such as and DMTU. First, we
determined the ability of these antioxidants to reduce the
quantifiable DCF fluorescence of triterpene-treated cells. For this
purpose, 1321N1 cells were incubated for 30 min with 100 or 500
units/mL of catalase, or 5 or 10 mmol/L of NAC, or 3 or 30 Amol/L
of DMTU before the addition of triterpenes. Under these
conditions, all the antioxidants significantly attenuated triterpene-induced ROS up-regulation (Fig. 5).

Next, to evaluate whether these hydrophilic antioxidants or the
lipophilic scavenger BHT—characterized to inhibit lipid peroxides
formation—were effective in preventing apoptotic cell death,
Annexin V staining analysis was done in oleanolic acid– and

maslinic acid–treated cells, at their IC50 value, in the presence or
absence of the antioxidants. We found that none of them by
themselves were toxic at the concentrations used. Overnight

fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis after staining
with Annexin V-phycoerythrin (Fig. 6B). Cells were treated
for 30 min with 500 units/mL catalase, 30 mmol/L DMTU, or
10 Amol/L BHT, before exposure to 25 Amol/L of the acidic triterpenes for 18 h, and as shown in Fig. 6A and B, the antioxidants at
the concentration used, protected cells from oleanolic acid– or
maslinic acid–induced cell death/damage.
The results showed that these antioxidants could significantly
reduce both DCF and Annexin V fluorescence in a dose-dependent
manner, attenuating the cell injury and apoptotic effect of oleanolic
acid or maslinic acid treatment. Moreover, the results suggest that
enhanced ROS production was directly associated with acidic
triterpene-induced programmed cell death on 1321N1 cells.
Triterpene-associated apoptosis is not restricted to 1321N1
cells. To rule out the possibility of a cell line–specific phenomenon,
we examined the ability of oleanolic acid and maslinic acid to
promote apoptosis in three additional human astrocytoma cell lines
(U373, U118, and U87). After exposure to 5 or 25 Amol/L oleanolic
acid or maslinic acid for 18 h, the cell lines were assayed for Annexin
V. Although the extent of the effects observed varied from cell to
cell, all cell types under study were found to bind Annexin V to a
significantly higher degree than untreated cells, indicating that all of
them undergo programmed cell death (Fig. 6C and D).

Discussion

cells. Cells were stimulated for 30 min with 25 Amol/L oleanolic acid or maslinic
acid in the absence or presence of different antioxidants. Solid gray curves,
cells cultured in the absence of any treatment (control); empty black curves,

maslinic acid increased Annexin V binding by f74% and 62%,
respectively, compared with cells that were not exposed to
triterpenes. When the antioxidant was added to the cell culture
medium, the extent of apoptosis was significantly reduced in a
concentration-dependent manner, except for NAC that was almost
ineffective. The representative effect of antioxidants on the
triterpene-induced astrocytic death was determined morphologically under a phase-contrast microscope (Fig. 6A) and by

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (8). April 15, 2007

The present study is the first to evaluate the potential
antitumoral effects of oleanolic acid and maslinic acid on human
astrocytoma cell lines. Oleanolic acid and maslinic acid have a
similar steroidal structure, but present small differences in the A
loop: with the addition of a hydroxyl group in C2, oleanolic acid
becomes maslinic acid. Nevertheless, both triterpenes showed
similar activity, shutting down the runaway proliferation of 1321N1
cells. Although we obtained them from pressed olive (O. europaea)
fruits, they are widely distributed in plants, and because of its
steroid-like structure it is not surprising that plants with
triterpenoids have anti-inflammatory properties.
We report here the novel finding that oleanolic acid and maslinic
acid inhibit DNA synthesis and induce apoptosis in human 1321N1
astrocytoma cells in a dose-dependent manner, fast and efficiently
(18 h). This conclusion is based on the following evidences:
appearance of typical apoptotic morphologic features, redistribution of cells to the subdiploid phase of the cell cycle, translocation
of plasma membrane phosphatidylserine, and generation of
processed caspase-3. Indeed, these hallmarks are accompanied of
ROS accumulation and disruption of DW m. The morphologic
changes, such as chromatin condensation and fragmentation,
cytoskeletal rearrangements, as well as cell shrinkage and
detachment, were shown by both phase-contrast optical and
fluorescence microscopy. Treatment with triterpenes resulted in
cells being more rounded and phase bright, showing a significant
reduction in the ability to both adhere and spread. Immunofluorescence showed that F-actin–containing stress fibers were
reduced in triterpene-treated cells, with a concomitant gross
change in the intermediate filament organization.
Our observation, that the inhibition of proliferation induced by
triterpenes in astrocytoma cell lines is mediated via apoptosis, is
consistent with earlier reports that show how these active
triterpenes produce a wide variety of inhibitory effects on tumor
promotion (21–24, 28), as well as antiproliferative and proapoptotic
effects on human cancer cells of different lineage such as leukemia,

mamarian and colon adenocarcinoma, or melanoma cells
(25, 29–33). However, the precise biochemical basis of these
antitumor activities remains to be determined. Some preliminary
studies on their mechanism of action have shown nuclear factor-nB
(NF-nB) transactivation in RAW 264 macrophages (34) and caspase3 activation in human colorectal adenocarcinoma cell lines (25, 35).
As reported for human cancer cell lines by other investigators,
modulation of the NF-nB signal transduction pathway is a key
mechanism for the antitumoral activity of various drugs, from
bioactive triterpenes: natural, such as celastrol (36), or synthetic,
such as CDDO (37) and CDDO-imidazolide (38), to nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory drugs, such as aspirin (39). In addition, because
triterpenes have a common steroid-like structure, it would not be
surprising that they acted like some steroid-related molecules,
modulating similar transduction pathways, including NF-nB (40).
However, in 1321N1 astrocytoma cells, no evidence of NF-nB
regulation was observed after oleanolic acid or maslinic acid
treatment, at any time or dose tested (data not shown). In fact,
NF-nB activation induced by tumor necrosis factor a in these cells
is neither potentiated nor attenuated by the presence of the
triterpenes (data not shown), indicating that the oleanolic acid and
maslinic acid antineoplastic activity involves a complex set of
biochemical pathways, depending on cell type and context.
Our data suggest that oleanolic acid and maslinic acid act as
stressors to which these cells respond by generating ROS and
decreasing the mitochondrial membrane potential, indications of
heightened oxidative stress, which may promote a cascade of
molecular events that prompts a cell to commit suicide. Significant

and persistent increases in intracellular ROS causes severe
oxidative stress within cells, through the formation of oxidized
cellular macromolecules, including lipids, proteins, and DNA.
Finally, their cleavage may generate enough structural and
functional damage to trigger cell death. We found in our study
that triterpene-induced ROS accumulation preceded triterpeneinduced apoptosis, being detected as early as 30 min after
treatment. In addition, pretreatment with antioxidants inhibited
triterpene-induced ROS generation and subsequent cell death.
Taken together, these findings suggest that among the pleiotropic
effects of oleanolic acid and maslinic acid on cancer cells, in
1321N1 they act as compounds to which the cell responds by
accumulating ROS and causing perturbation of mitochondrial
functions, ultimately leading to apoptosis. However, the redox
status leading to cell death is not a general mechanism of action of
pentacyclic triterpenes. Although this also occurs in HT-29 human
colon adenocarcinoma cells (25), some studies in HL-60 cells have
reported that the natural echinocystic acid induces apoptosismediated mitochondria dysfunction, independently of ROS generation (41). Moreover, the novel synthetic analogue of the oleanolic
acid, methyl-2-cyano-3,12-dioxooleana-1,9-dien-28-oate, promotes
apoptosis without inducing oxidative stress in multiple myeloma
cells (42); even ursolic acid prevents the PC12 cell from reactive
oxygen species toxicity.
However, a general process in cells in response to a plethora of
apoptosis inducers is the rearrangement of cytoskeleton organization. In this process, the components of the cytoskeleton network,
which extend throughout the entire cytoplasm of a cell, acquire

special relevance. Thus, actin, an element of microfilaments,
tubulin, a constituent of microtubules, and vimentin, one of the
proteins of intermediate filaments, apart from structural support,
exert important functions in cell motility, mitosis, and intracellular
trafficking; moreover, changes in the distribution/dynamics of
these cytoskeletal proteins seem to be consistent with features of
apoptosis (43). Although the mechanism is not well understood,
the involvement of cytoskeletal actin in apoptosis has been
suggested in some morphologic studies, which show actin cleavage
during morphologic apoptosis (44). In addition, it has also been
shown that caspase proteolysis of vimentin filaments plays an
active role in the execution of apoptosis and serves to amplify the
cell death signaling (45).
In our study, triterpene-treated cells showed impaired adherence, disruption of the actin filaments, stronger F-actin labeling in
the center of the cell, and altered distribution of vimentin. Similar
actions have been reported for other triterpenes and cytostatic
drugs in prostate carcinoma cells (46), human lung cancer (47), or
leukemia cells (48). It seems likely that the proteolytic disassembly
of the rigid cytoskeleton network may facilitate many of the morphologic manifestations of apoptosis, including cellular rounding.
It is noteworthy that the effect of maslinic acid and oleanolic acid
on apoptosis induction is not selective for 1321N1 cell line, because
they induce apoptosis in other astrocytoma cell lines, such as U87,
U373, or U118, suggesting a broad spectrum of action and, therefore,
a potential interest of these compounds in brain cancer patients.

In summary, we found that oleanolic acid and maslinic acid
inhibit DNA synthesis and induce apoptotic events in human
astrocytoma cells. Our findings show that the pentacyclic
triterpenes oleanolic acid and maslinic acid induce an oxidative
apoptotic pathway, causing cell cycle and cytoskeleton alterations. Moreover, because recent evidences suggest that the
failure of cells to undergo apoptotic cell death may be involved
not only in cancer but also in the pathogenesis of a variety of
human diseases, including autoimmune diseases, this opens new
expectations to design more specific therapies directed to remove
cells that have lost growth control by modifying their ability to
activate the intrinsic suicide program. Therefore, these results
support the hypothesis that oleanolic acid and maslinic acid may
be useful molecules for the development of better antiproliferative agents.
