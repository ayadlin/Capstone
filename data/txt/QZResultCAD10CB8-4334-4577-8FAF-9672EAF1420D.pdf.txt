Abstract
Triptolide, an active component of the medicinal herb lei gong
teng, is a potent anticancer and anti-inflammatory therapeutic.
It potently inhibits nuclear factor-KB transcriptional activation
after DNA binding, although a precise mechanism is as yet
unknown. Here, we report that triptolide also induces distinct
nuclear substructural changes in HeLa cells. These changes in
the nucleolus and nuclear speckles are reversible and dependent on both time and concentration. Furthermore, nuclear
changes occurred within hours of triptolide treatment and were
calcium and caspase independent. Rounding of nuclear
speckles, an indication of transcriptional arrest, was evident
and was associated with a decrease in RNA polymerase II (RNA
Pol II) COOH-terminal domain Ser2 phosphorylation. Additionally, the nucleolus disassembled and RNA Pol I activity
declined after RNA Pol II inhibition. We therefore conclude that
triptolide causes global transcriptional arrest as evidenced by
inactivity of RNA Pol I and II and the subsequent alteration in
nuclear substructure. [Cancer Res 2008;68(13):5257–66]

Introduction
The small-molecule triptolide, a natural product isolated from
the ‘‘thunder god vine,’’ has been of great interest as a therapeutic
for diseases such as cancer, arthritis, and autoimmune disorders.
Research into its mechanism of action has revealed that it potently
inhibits transcription of numerous proinflammatory mediators
(1, 2), can activate caspases and other proapoptotic cascades (3–5),
has separable mechanisms of action as defined by calcium
concentration (6), and can activate calcium release through the
polycystin-2 cation channel (7). One biological effect of triptolide
that has received the most interest has been its ability to suppress
cytokine-mediated transcriptional activity. Although there are
reports in the literature citing the transcriptional effects of
triptolide as both specific (2, 8) and global (9), it is clear that in
many different cell lines triptolide is efficient at inhibiting
expression of nuclear factor-nB (NF-nB)-mediated gene targets,
hence its anti-inflammatory effects. However, because triptolide
has also been reported most recently to reduce total RNA levels (9),
it is of interest to further characterize how triptolide might be
causing global transcriptional arrest.
The nucleus is highly compartmentalized to ensure efficient
cellular functions, such as ribosome biogenesis and RNA polymerase II (RNA Pol II)-driven transcription. One specialized domain
formed around actively transcribed rRNA genes is the nucleolus.
This nuclear substructure not only is crucial to rRNA transcription

and ribosome assembly but has also been shown to be involved in
cell cycle regulation, proliferation, and the cellular stress response
(10). Perturbations in cellular transcription are mirrored by
changes in nucleolar structure; RNA Pol II inhibitors 5,6-dichloroh-D-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole (DRB) and a-amanitin have previously been shown to alter nucleolar integrity, resulting in the
dispersal of this subnuclear structure (11). Additionally, actinomycin D can be used to inhibit RNA Pol I at low concentrations
(0.04–0.05 Ag/mL) leading to condensation of rDNA, whereas high
concentrations (2 Ag/mL) additionally inhibit RNA Pol II activity
and induce nucleolar disassembly (12, 13).
The nucleolar proteome is currently estimated to have f700
proteins, many of which are of unknown function (14, 15). However,
several proteins are well described, such as nucleolin (C23),
nucleophosmin (NPM; B23), and upstream binding factor (UBF).
Nucleolin is a multifunctional protein described as having roles
in ribosome biogenesis, transcription, cell cycle regulation, and
nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling capabilities (16). NPM is a phosphoprotein involved in numerous cellular activities, such as transcriptional regulation, centrosome duplication (17), nuclear
chaperoning (18), ribosome biogenesis, and nucleic acid binding
and processing (19). Additionally, NPM is frequently up-regulated
or is subject to genetic mutation or translocation in leukemias and
lymphomas (20). UBF is a crucial cotranscriptional activator of the
RNA Pol I complex; loss of UBF from the nucleolus is highly
indicative of Pol I inactivity (21, 22).
Another subnuclear domain is the nuclear speckle, a region
specialized in mRNA transcript splicing. These structures are
highly dynamic as splicing factors are continually shuttling to sites
of active transcription (23). They are characterized by their
irregular shape and size and are frequently identified by the
localization of the splicing factor SC35. Nuclear speckles are
thought to form on the periphery of active RNA Pol II
transcriptional complexes and, in addition to splicing components,
may also contain cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk)/cyclin complexes
necessary for Pol II activity (24). These Cdk/cyclin complexes
phosphorylate the COOH-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA Pol II,
composed of 52 heptapeptide repeats in humans, and are therefore
responsible for regulation of transcriptional activity. The TFIIH
complex, containing Cdk7, phosphorylates Ser5 in the CTD and
promotes initiation of transcription and promoter clearance
(25, 26). Next, Ser2 is phosphorylated by the positive transcription
elongation factor b complex (P-TEFb) composed of Cdk9 and cyclin
T1 and promotes elongation of the mRNA transcript (27, 28). On
RNA Pol II inhibition, nuclear speckles enlarge, become rounded,
and decrease in number due to the accumulation of the splicing
machinery (29, 30). As with nucleolar disruption, this effect has
been observed with actinomycin D, DRB, and a-amanitin,
signifying a link between active transcription and the maintenance
of a structurally ordered nucleus.
In this study, we focused on the transcriptional effect of
triptolide as assessed in the cervical carcinoma cell line HeLa.

Previous work with this in vitro model showed that although
transcriptional inhibition of NF-nB is concentration dependent,
calcium was not required for this effect (6). Here, we have taken a
cell biological approach to correlate differences in nuclear
structure to the known inhibitory effect of triptolide on NF-nB–
mediated transcription. Therefore, we examined changes in the
nucleolus and nuclear speckles, two nuclear substructures that are
indicative of changes in the global transcriptional activity of the
cell. Our results support a concentration-dependent model of
triptolide-induced RNA Pol II inactivity leading to transcriptional
arrest and cell death.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture and reagents. HeLa cells were cultured as previously
described (6). Triptolide was obtained from Sinobest, Inc. and dissolved in
DMSO. Actinomycin D, calcimycin, and ionomycin were obtained from
EMD Biosciences. Caspase-3 activity assay was purchased from Biomol and
zVAD-fmk was purchased from Genotech. Antibodies purchased were as
follows: nucleolin, NPM, UBF, Cdk9, and cyclin T1 from Santa Cruz
Biotechnology; SC35 from Abcam; phospho-Thr199 NPM from Cell Signaling
Technology; and phospho-Ser2 (BL2894) and Ser5 (BL2896) RNA Pol II
antibodies from Bethyl Laboratories. NF-nB-luciferase assay was performed
as previously described (6).
Generation of Clone-2. HeLa cells were incubated first with 100 nmol/L
triptolide for 96 h and then with 1 Amol/L triptolide for an additional 96 h.
Remaining cells were grown with 100 nmol/L triptolide until clonal
populations were evident. Triptolide-resistant clones were found to grow in
triptolide concentrations up to 1 Amol/L, where 5 Amol/L induced cell
death. Routine administration of 100 nmol/L triptolide is added to cells to
confirm maintenance of triptolide resistance.
Western blotting. Total cell lysates [0.5% Triton X-100, 50 mmol/L Tris
(pH 7.4), 150 mmol/L NaCl, 500 mmol/L EDTA, and Complete protease
inhibitors (Roche)] were prepared and protein levels were normalized. For
nuclear fractions, cytosolic extract was removed following hypotonic lysis
[10 mmol/L HEPES (pH 7.4), 10 mmol/L KCl, 0.1 mmol/L EDTA, 1 mmol/L
DTT, 0.5 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride] and 0.15% NP40 was
added immediately before centrifugation. The pellet was resuspended in
nuclear extract buffer [20 mmol/L HEPES (pH 7.4), 1 mmol/L EDTA,
0.4 mol/L NaCl, 1 mmol/L DTT] and centrifuged and the supernatant was
retained. For RNase A experiments, the cytosolic and nuclear fractions were
cleared with 0.5% Triton X-100 lysis buffer, and the resulting pellet was
resolubilized in nuclear lysis buffer plus 0.1 mg/mL RNase A for 30 min on
ice. Antibodies for nucleolin, NPM, UBF, Cdk9, and cyclin T1 (1:1,000) and
RNA Pol II Ser2 and Ser5 antibodies (1:5,000) were incubated in 5% milk/
TBS-Tween 20 (TBST) before enhanced chemiluminescence detection
(GE Healthcare).
Immunofluorescence. For nucleolin, NPM, and UBF [1:200, 1.5% normal
goat serum (NGS)/PBS], cells were fixed in methanol and blocked in 5%
NGS/PBS; for phospho-Thr199 NPM [1:100, 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA)/
TBS], cells were fixed in methanol and blocked in 10% NGS/1% BSA/TBS.
SC35 (1:1,000, PBS) and Ser2 and Ser5 RNA Pol II (1:400, 5% BSA/PBS)
detection required 4% paraformaldehyde/0.2% Triton X-100/PBS followed
by methanol fixation. Cdk9 detection (1:600) required 4% paraformaldehyde/0.5% Triton X-100/PBS fixation and blocking in 5% milk/TBST.
Secondary antibodies were anti-rabbit or anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 488
(green) or Alexa Fluor 594 (red; Molecular Probes), and all samples were
mounted in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories).
All parvalbumin-green fluorescent protein (PV-GFP) constructs (31) were
a gift of Anton Bennett (Yale University, New Haven, CT). Cells were
transiently transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) plus 1 Ag of
one of the following plasmids for 24 h: cytomegalovirus (CMV)-GFP, CMVnuclear export signal (NES)-PV-GFP, or CMV-nuclear localization signal
(NLS)-PV-GFP. Following confirmation of GFP expression by microscopy,
100 nmol/L triptolide was added for 6 h. Cells were fixed and stained for
nucleolin as described above.

Images were acquired using an Olympus CK40 inverted microscope and
an Olympus digital camera. Confocal images were acquired under 63 oil
immersion objective using a Zeiss Inverted Axiovert microscope and a BioRad MRC 1024 laser source. Images were captured in single color channels
as .pic files using LaserSharp software and then converted with Image J
(NIH). For colocalization studies, images were artificially merged using
Adobe Photoshop CS where indicated.
Reverse transcription-PCR. Total RNA was extracted using RNeasy
(Qiagen) and each sample was normalized. Reverse transcription-PCR (RTPCR) was performed using SuperScript One-Step RT-PCR with Platinum
Taq kit (Invitrogen) and S14 primers were previously described (32).
Total RNA (350 ng) was used for S14, reverse transcription proceeded
30 min/50jC, and the PCR amplification protocol was as follows: 94jC/2
min; 35 cycles of 94jC/15 s, 58jC/30 s, 72jC/1 min; 72jC/5 min. Total RNA
(2 Ag) was used for 5¶ external transcribed spacer (ETS) 45S amplification
(33), reverse transcription proceeded at 50jC/30 min, and then 5 AL of the
50 AL reverse transcription reaction were used with the following protocol:
95jC/3 min; 25 cycles of 95jC/1 min, 65jC/1 min, 72jC/1 min; 72jC/5 min.

Results
Triptolide-mediated disruption of nucleolar structure is
time and concentration dependent. We began our experiments
by examining the nucleolus as its integrity has been used as an
indicator of both RNA Pol I and II transcriptional activity. Previous
work in our laboratory has shown that, in HeLa cells, 50 nmol/L
triptolide for 6 h is the minimum concentration required to cause
NF-nB transcriptional inhibition (6). We therefore incubated HeLa
cells for 6 h with triptolide concentrations up to 1 Amol/L and
examined nucleolar substructure. At concentrations of z50 nmol/L,
we observed that the integrity of the nucleolus was compromised
as nucleolin staining became irregular in shape and diffuse
through the nucleoplasm (Fig. 1A). This change in localization
was prominent at 100 nmol/L in the majority of cells, and at
1 Amol/L, the nucleolus had completely dispersed (Fig. 1A). Because
we have previously described that 100 nmol/L triptolide is effective
at causing robust transcriptional inhibition and cell death, and we
could now correlate that with clear nucleolar disassembly, we chose
to focus on this concentration in the majority of the remaining
experiments. Over a 6-h time course with 100 nmol/L triptolide, we
observed that nucleolin localization changes began after 3 h of
continual culture (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, this effect was predominantly reversible if cells were incubated for no more than 4 h before
triptolide removal (Fig. 1C). However, if triptolide was left in culture
for 6 h before removal, the nucleolus did not recover and cells were
committed to cell death (Fig. 1C). This first set of experiments led us
to believe that general transcription may be affected by triptolide, so
we next examined another subnuclear marker that changes on
transcriptional arrest—the nuclear speckle.
Nuclear speckles become enlarged and rounded following
triptolide treatment. We used an antibody to the splicing factor
SC35 to assess nuclear speckle morphology in response to 100
nmol/L triptolide or DMSO over a 6-h time course. Whereas DMSO
control cells had numerous speckles of various size and shape, cells
treated with triptolide displayed a distinct rounding and enlargement of speckles beginning after 2 h of incubation (Fig. 2A). This
morphologic change, a marker of transcriptional arrest, became
more pronounced over the 6-h time course that was in marked
contrast to DMSO control (Fig. 2A). We next examined the
concentration-dependent effect of triptolide on speckle morphology after 6 and 16 h of continual incubation. After 6 h (the time at
which NF-nB inhibition has been studied), only 50 and 100 nmol/L
of triptolide caused observable speckle rounding. Following 16 h,

Triptolide Alters Nuclear Substructure

Figure 1. Triptolide induces nucleolar disassembly. HeLa cells were
treated with triptolide before fixation and staining for nucleolin by indirect
immunofluorescence under the following conditions: increasing concentrations of
triptolide for 6 h (A) and 100 nmol/L triptolide over a 6-h time course (B ).
C, cells were pretreated with 100 nmol/L triptolide for the indicated times,
washed, and allowed to recover for 16 h. All images were acquired under
25 magnification. Scale bar, 10 Am.

25 to 100 nmol/L triptolide (concentrations shown to cause cell
death in HeLa cells; ref. 6) induced prominent speckle rounding
and an increase in size (Fig. 2B). Therefore, our data indicate that
nuclear speckle rounding begins at 50 nmol/L with acute triptolide
addition (6 h), although 25 nmol/L is also sufficient for this effect,
although over a longer time course.
Subnuclear structures are unaltered in a triptolide-resistant
clonal line. We have isolated a triptolide-resistant clonal cell line
derived from HeLa, named Clone-2, which remains viable in the
presence of up to 1 Amol/L triptolide. Because 100 nmol/L
triptolide causes rapid death in HeLa, but is permissive for growth
in Clone-2 cells, we compared nucleolar and nuclear speckle
differences in these lines as an indicator of cell death and
transcriptional activity. After 6 h of incubation with 100 nmol/L
triptolide, HeLa cells exhibited the characteristic nucleolar
disassembly as assessed by both differential interference contrast
(DIC) microscopy and localization of nucleolin (Fig. 3A). This was

www.aacrjournals.org

in contrast to Clone-2 cells that retained nucleolar integrity;
however, nucleolar borders became slightly irregular in shape
(Fig. 3A). To confirm that Clone-2 cells are capable of a cellular
stress response and RNA Pol I inhibition, we incubated cells with
10 nmol/L actinomycin D and found that in both HeLa and Clone-2
cells nucleolar structure was affected (Fig. 3A).
Because our triptolide-resistant cell line showed only a minor
change in the shape of the nucleolar compartment, we next
determined if NF-nB–mediated transactivation was affected.
Following tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a) incubation alone, both
HeLa and Clone-2 cells responded with similar levels of NF-nBluciferase induction (Fig. 3B). Coincubation of 100 nmol/L
triptolide plus TNF-a resulted in a 4-fold reduction of activity
in HeLa, whereas Clone-2 cells retained the majority of its
transcriptional activation (Fig. 3B). The resistance of Clone-2 to
both nucleolar disassembly and transcriptional inhibition ultimately correlated with cell survival. Whereas 72 h of incubation
with 100 nmol/L triptolide resulted in cell detachment and death
for HeLa cells, Clone-2 cells survived and continued to proliferate
with a doubling time of f28 h (Fig. 3C; data not shown). Because
only minor effects on nucleolar integrity or transcription were
observed for Clone-2 cells with an acute triptolide time course, we
next assessed nucleolar changes after 16 h of continual culture with
triptolide. After 16 h of 100 nmol/L triptolide, many HeLa cells
detached indicating cell death and those remaining adherent were
characterized by a dispersal of nucleolin throughout the nucleoplasm, and several large rounded nuclear speckles (Fig. 3D). Clone2 cells remained adherent, the nucleolus was intact, nuclear
speckles looked similar to DMSO-treated control, and cells
continued to grow (Fig. 3D). Taken together, our results thus far
indicate that changes in the structure of both the nucleolus and
nuclear speckles correlate to transcriptional inactivation and cell
death due to high triptolide concentrations.
Triptolide-induced changes in nucleolar and nuclear speckle
morphology are calcium, stress, and caspase independent. To
begin examining a putative mechanism for the observed subnuclear changes due to triptolide, we next focused on the role of
calcium. We have previously shown that NF-nB transcriptional
inhibition is calcium independent and therefore wanted to
determine if changes to both the nucleolus and nuclear speckles
(and their role in transcriptional regulation) were also calcium
independent. Because triptolide can elicit calcium release (7), we
first wanted to establish if calcium ionophores could mimic
triptolide-induced nucleolar disassembly. Whereas incubation with
100 nmol/L triptolide for 6 h led to a dramatic loss of nucleolar
integrity, neither calcimycin nor ionomycin could mimic the effect
(Fig. 4A). We next incubated cells in the absence of extracellular
calcium and still observed triptolide-induced nucleolin dispersal
and speckle rounding (Fig. 4B). As a third method to test the
requirement of calcium-mediated signaling on triptolide-mediated
nuclear changes, we used GFP-PV constructs (31) that were
localized to either the nucleus (NLS-PV-GFP) or cytosol (NES-PVGFP). Expression of these constructs in their specific cellular
compartments acts to buffer the response of a calcium signal.
Expression of the GFP constructs alone did not affect nucleolar
morphology as assessed by nucleolin immunofluorescent localization (Fig. 4C). In the presence of triptolide, nucleolar structure
dispersed regardless of either cytosolic or nuclear calcium
buffering (Fig. 4C). We therefore conclude that the subnuclear
changes we observe with high triptolide concentrations are
calcium independent.

Nucleolar disassembly has also been used to detect activation of
the cellular stress response through p38 kinase or c-Jun NH2terminal kinase (JNK) signaling (34). To determine if triptolide
induced a general stress response that was then reflected on
nucleolar integrity, we incubated cells with the p38 kinase inhibitor
SB203580 or the JNK inhibitor SP600125 F 100 nmol/L triptolide
for 6 h. Treatment with DMSO or either inhibitor alone did not
alter nucleolar structure and, in addition, neither could rescue the
effect of triptolide on nucleolar dispersal (Fig. 4D). Because caspase
activation by triptolide has been well documented in the literature,
we assessed whether the observed changes in nuclear structure
could be due to proteolytic cleavage by active caspases. Incubation
with the irreversible broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor zVAD-fmk
failed to rescue triptolide-induced nucleolar disassembly (Fig. 4D).
Furthermore, triptolide-induced caspase-3 activation was first
evident after 9 h of incubation, with strong activation beginning
at 14 h (Fig. 4D). Because nucleolar and speckle changes begin as
early as 2 h after triptolide addition, it is unlikely that caspases are
inducing these effects. We therefore continued to probe changes in
proteins associated with either the nucleolus or nuclear speckles to
determine a possible mechanism for triptolide-induced transcriptional inhibition.
Nucleolar disassembly is characterized by changes in
nucleolin, NPM, and UBF localization. Because we had
previously characterized the loss of nucleolar integrity only by
nucleolin immunofluorescent localization, we wanted to determine
if NPM and UBF were also connected with this observed effect.
Following triptolide incubation, nucleolin, NPM, and UBF dispersed

into the nucleoplasm, leaving only a small remnant of the
nucleolus in some cells (Fig. 5A). To examine if there were any
protein stability or modification changes, nuclear lysates from an
8-h triptolide time course were separated by SDS-PAGE; however,
all protein levels remained constant and there was no apparent
cleavage or shift in mobility (Fig. 5B).
Because NPM has been found to bind RNA and aid in processing,
we assessed if triptolide could alter this interaction. Following
nuclear protein extraction, the remaining pellet was treated with
RNase A to release any bound NPM, as Triton X-100 extraction
alone is insufficient to solubilize this population of NPM (35).
Although total nuclear levels of NPM before RNase treatment again
remained stable following triptolide incubation, it was evident that
the functionally active NPM population bound to RNA decreased
following 3 h (Fig. 5C). This finding suggests that RNA processing
and transcription is altered in the presence of triptolide.
NPM phosphorylation at Thr199 (p-NPM) has previously been
reported to target NPM to nuclear speckles and repress pre-mRNA
processing in the presence of the RNA Pol II inhibitor a-amanitin
(36). Because we observed a change in both nucleolar integrity and
nuclear speckle rounding following triptolide addition, we next
examined p-NPM expression and localization in relation to nuclear
speckles. In control-treated HeLa cells, p-NPM expression was
nucleolar with little or no overlap with the nuclear speckle marker
SC35 (Fig. 5D). In contrast, immunofluorescent staining of
triptolide-treated cells showed colocalization of punctate p-NPM
regions with nuclear speckles (Fig. 5D). It remained to be
elucidated whether nucleolar dispersal was due to an inhibition

speckle rounding. A, HeLa cells were
incubated with 100 nmol/L triptolide (T )
or DMSO (D) over a 6-h time course.
Following fixation, cells were stained for
the splicing factor SC35 by indirect
immunofluorescence. B, cells were
incubated with 0, 25, 50, or 100 nmol/L of
triptolide for either 6 or 16 h of continual
culture before assessing SC35 localization.

of RNA Pol I or was an indirect effect following RNA Pol II
inhibition. To address this, we next studied key phosphorylation
sites on the CTD of the large subunit of RNA Pol II and its
subsequent transcriptional activity.
RNA Pol II phosphorylation and transcriptional activity
decrease on triptolide addition. The CTD in mammalian cells is
composed of >50 repeats of a heptapeptide sequence in which Ser5
and Ser2 are required for initiation and elongation of transcription,
respectively (25). To determine if triptolide could affect general
transcription by influencing either Ser2 or Ser5 phosphorylation,
we examined nuclear lysates prepared from a triptolide time
course. Western blot analysis indicated that Ser2 phosphorylation
levels significantly decreased between 2 and 3 h of incubation,
whereas Ser5 levels remained largely elevated, although some
fluctuation was evident (Fig. 6A). It is also noteworthy that a

www.aacrjournals.org

higher molecular weight band is detected in the 3- and 6-h time
points and may be indicative of a sustained or increased level of
Ser5 phosphorylation over the length of the CTD. As an additional
method to evaluate changes in CTD phosphorylation, we
examined Ser5 and Ser2 by immunofluorescence microscopy and
again observed only a significant decrease in Ser2 phosphorylation
that was not dependent on calcium (Fig. 6A). To examine the
effect of triptolide concentration on RNA Pol II phosphorylation,
we incubated HeLa cells with 10 to 100 nmol/L of triptolide for
6 h. Beginning at 50 nmol/L, a mild inhibition of Ser2 phosphorylation was evident and this decrease became prominent at
the 75 to 100 nmol/L concentrations (Fig. 6A). This regulation of
RNA Pol II seemed to be relevant to the proapoptotic or
transcriptional inhibitory effects of triptolide as Clone-2 was not
Ser2 responsive (Fig. 6B).

All of our data collected thus far linked nucleolar disruption,
nuclear speckle rounding, and a decrease in Ser2 phosphorylation
of the CTD of RNA Pol II to the same time frame (6 h) and
triptolide concentrations (z50 nmol/L) that are associated with
NF-nB inhibition in HeLa cells. We next wanted to determine if
RNA Pol I and/or Pol II transcriptional activity was inhibited and,
if so, to know if there was a chronological order to this effect. To do
this, we assessed RNA Pol II activity by transcript levels of
ribosomal subunit S14 and RNA Pol I by the 5¶ ETS region of the
pre-ribosomal 45S transcript. Total RNA from an equal number of
cells per time point was extracted following incubation with
100 nmol/L triptolide over 6 h. Regardless of triptolide addition,
total RNA levels seemed similar in all samples (Fig. 6C). Following
RT-PCR analysis, we observed a dramatic reduction in RNA Pol II
transcriptional activity that was evident as early as 1 h after
triptolide addition (Fig. 6C). This effect was most prominent
following 3 h of incubation that corresponds with a clear rounding
of nuclear speckles (Fig. 2A). Because the 5¶ ETS of the 45S rRNA is
rapidly cleaved and processed following transcription, we used this
sequence as a target for RT-PCR amplification to assess RNA Pol I
activity. Levels of this transcript did not start to decline until
3 h after triptolide addition, which is concomitant with the onset
of nucleolar disassembly (Fig. 6C). Because the Cdk9/cyclin T1
complex (P-TEFb) is known to phosphorylate Ser2 of the RNA Pol II
CTD, we next examined the expression of these two proteins. Over
a 6-h, 100 nmol/L triptolide time course, total nuclear levels of

Cdk9 or cyclin T1 were constant (Fig. 6D). Complex formation was
tested by coimmunoprecipitation experiments and again Cdk9/
cyclin T1 interaction remained stable (Fig. 6D). Additionally, Cdk9
localization remained nuclear even as nucleolar disassembly
became evident (Fig. 6D).
Taken together, our data support a model in which high
proapoptotic concentrations of triptolide cause RNA Pol II
transcriptional inhibition through a decrease in Ser2 phosphorylation. After RNA Pol II inhibition, RNA Pol I transcriptional activity
is also attenuated, affecting RNA ribosome biogenesis as early as
3 h following triptolide addition. Therefore, we conclude that
triptolide affects global transcription in a concentration-dependent
manner as evidenced by the following: (a) attenuation of
transcripts associated with ribosome biogenesis, (b) RNA Pol II
activity and its regulatory phosphorylation decreases, (c) nuclear
speckle rounding is evident indicating mRNA splicing has ceased,
and (d) normal nucleolar structure is lost and RNA Pol I activity
decreases.

Discussion
Triptolide, a natural product isolated from a Chinese medicinal
plant, may be therapeutically relevant for a variety of proliferative
disorders, such as cancer (37, 38) and autosomal dominant
polycystic kidney disease (7), or autoimmune diseases and
inflammation, such as systemic lupus erythematosus and arthritis

(39, 40). Its cellular effects and mechanisms of action are highly
complex and undoubtedly involve multiple biological pathways.
Ongoing studies in several laboratories have elucidated key points
in the mode of action of triptolide, such as concentrationdependent and cell type–dependent effects (37), a partial
dependence on calcium (6), modulation of apoptosis-activating
proteins (3–5), and inhibition of the transcription factor NF-nB at
a step following DNA binding (8). Although the emphasis of
triptolide-induced transcriptional inhibition has focused on NF-nB

and its proinflammatory gene targets, triptolide has also been
reported to suppress AP-1 (41), NFAT (8), and HSF1 (42)
transactivation as well. In contrast to the hypothesis that triptolide
targets transcription factors with specificity, triptolide has also
been reported to suppress total RNA synthesis (9); however, a
mechanism has not been described. We began a careful analysis of
nuclear substructure changes indicative of global transcriptional
arrest at triptolide concentrations and time points known to
inhibit NF-nB–mediated transcription (6). Furthermore, we were

able to characterize changes in RNA polymerase activity describing
a potential mechanistic action.
Known transcriptional inhibitors that affect RNA Pol II, such as
actinomycin D, DRB, and a-amanitin, have all been previously
shown to cause nuclear speckle rounding and/or nucleolar
disruption. It should, however, be noted that coordination of
RNA Pol I, II, and III activity is tightly regulated as inhibition of one
will affect the efficiency of the others (43, 44). This coordinated
action of all RNA polymerases ensures sufficient protein subunits
and rRNA to complete ribosome assembly. We first observed a
reversible nucleolar disassembly induced by triptolide and further
explored if it was an indication of global transcriptional changes in
the cell as assessed by nuclear speckle morphology. Whereas
speckle size, shape, and number can vary per cell, RNA Pol II
transcriptional inhibition is marked by an accumulation of the
splicing machinery and a concomitant increase in speckle size.
Although 100 nmol/L triptolide incubation resulted in a decrease in
RNA Pol II transcription after only 1 h, changes in speckle
morphology and a decrease in Ser2 RNA Pol II phosphorylation
were readily observed after 2 h. Additionally, residual p-NPM was
found associated with nuclear speckles, an event previously
correlated with transcriptional inactivity (36). Ser5 phosphorylation

was relatively constant throughout our time course; however,
we did observe minor fluctuations. This could be due to cell cycle–
dependent effects or may reflect differences in the number of
Ser5 phosphorylations along the full length of the CTD. Although
we believe that Ser2 is the site of primary regulation by triptolide,
we cannot rule out an additional or indirect effect on Ser5
phosphorylation as well.
If we examine the timeline of data stemming from these
experiments, a model emerges where triptolide (100 nmol/L) has
an effect on RNA Pol II efficiency in just 1 h as assessed by
transcript levels of the S14 ribosomal subunit. After 2 h, nuclear
speckles become rounded, Pol II transcriptional efficiency continues to decline, and RNA Pol II Ser2 phosphorylation decreases.
Following 3 h, the nucleolus begins to unravel, and RNA Pol I
activity now begins to decrease. It is of note that, at this time, these
effects are still reversible and cells may fully recover provided that
triptolide is removed from culture. However, after 6 h of continual
culture, RNA Pol I and II activities are absent and nucleolar
organization has dissolved, which may therefore be the turning
point toward the commitment to cell death. We should also note
that this timeline of cellular effects may be shifted by triptolide
concentration. For example, our data with 25 nmol/L triptolide

Figure 6. Triptolide inhibits RNA Pol II activity. A, HeLa cells were treated with 100 nmol/L triptolide over a 6-h time course or increasing triptolide concentrations
for 6 h before nuclear lysates were prepared. RNA Pol II phosphorylation at Ser2 or Ser5 of the CTD was assessed by Western blot analysis. Left, molecular
weight markers in kDa. Immunofluorescence localization of RNA Pol II Ser2 or Ser5 phosphorylation in the presence or absence [( ) Ca2+ ] of calcium-containing
medium was also completed. Results are representative of four separate experiments. Scale bar, 10 Am. B, Clone-2 cells were treated with 100 nmol/L triptolide
for 6 h and assessed for differences in Ser2 and Ser5 phosphorylation by Western blot analysis and immunofluorescence localization. Results are representative of three
separate experiments. C, HeLa cells were treated with 100 nmol/L triptolide over a 6-h time course and total RNA was extracted from each sample. RNA was
normalized per sample and RT-PCR was performed to assess Pol I and II activity. The ribosomal protein S14 transcript is transcribed by RNA Pol II and the 5¶ ETS of
45S pre-rRNA is transcribed by RNA Pol I. Results shown are representative of three separate experiments. D, HeLa cells were incubated in the presence of 100 nmol/L
triptolide during a 6-h time course. Total cyclin T1 and Cdk9 protein levels (left ), Cdk9/cyclin T1 complex interaction by Cdk9 immunoprecipitation (IP ; middle ),
and Cdk9 immunolocalization (right ) were assessed. A/G represents immunoprecipitation with protein A/G agarose beads and DIC inset shows nucleolar integrity.
Results are representative of three separate experiments.

Triptolide Alters Nuclear Substructure

(previously shown to induce cell death in HeLa) do not show any
effect on transcription, nucleolar disassembly, or speckle rounding
at the 6-h time point. However, after 16 h in culture, 25 nmol/L
causes prominent enlargement and rounding of speckles, ultimately leading to cell death.
We additionally generated a triptolide-resistant clonal population of HeLa (Clone-2) to test if these nuclear changes were specific
to both transcription and cell death. Although Clone-2 cells
exhibited a very minor fluctuation in nucleolar integrity and
transcriptional inhibition, cells were able to escape from death and
dissolution of the nucleolus during an extended incubation with
100 nmol/L triptolide. The cells from this clonal line retain the
majority of their transcriptional activity and do not undergo
nuclear speckle rounding or inhibition of Ser2 phosphorylation. We
have yet to discover why these cells are relatively resistant to
triptolide-induced nucleolar disruption or RNA Pol II inactivation,
but we are currently investigating these questions as we further
dissect the mechanism of action of triptolide.
Taken together, we conclude that NF-nB transcriptional
inhibition in HeLa cells correlates with global transcriptional
and structural changes in the cell. Because the RelA subunit of
NF-nB has been shown to recruit P-TEFb to stimulate RNA Pol
II transcriptional elongation in response to cytokine stimulation
(45), it is possible that this explains why the NF-nB pathway is
exquisitely sensitive to triptolide regulation in multiple cell
lines. In fact, treatment of cells with the P-TEFb inhibitor DRB
sensitizes cells to TNF-a–induced apoptosis, similar to the
effect observed with triptolide. Although we found no obvious
changes in Cdk9/cyclin T1 interaction and no changes in

protein levels or localization in Cdk9, it is likely that other
mechanisms of regulation exist, such as cofactor recruitment to
the RNA Pol II transcriptional complex, acetylation events, or
regulation of Cdk9 binding to HEXIM1 and 7SK small nuclear
RNA (46, 47).
Triptolide is a small molecule with multiple physiologic effects,
such as immune modulation and chemotherapeutic. Its biological
effects on cell growth and transcription vary by concentration,
duration of exposure, and cell type. Here, we have shown that
triptolide induces nuclear substructural changes in both the
nucleolus and nuclear speckles that are associated with a rapid
decrease in RNA Pol II transcriptional efficiency. Use of these
nuclear substructures as surrogate markers for transcriptional
arrest and possibly cytotoxicity will be of great utility in delineating
the separate biological functions of triptolide and its derivatives.
As the mode of action of triptolide continues to unfold, it may
eventually be possible to understand its multiple regulatory actions
on the cell as well as its therapeutic potentials.
