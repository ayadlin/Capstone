SUMMARY

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Protein kinase C (PKC) isozymes have remained elusive cancer targets despite the unambiguous
tumor promoting function of their potent ligands, phorbol esters, and the prevalence of their
mutations. We analyzed 8% of PKC mutations identified in human cancers and found that,
surprisingly, most were loss of function and none were activating. Loss-of-function mutations
occurred in all PKC subgroups and impeded second-messenger binding, phosphorylation, or
catalysis. Correction of a loss-of-function PKCβ mutation by CRISPR-mediated genome editing in
a patient-derived colon cancer cell line suppressed anchorage-independent growth and reduced
tumor growth in a xenograft model. Hemizygous deletion promoted anchorage-independent
growth, revealing that PKCβ is haploinsufficient for tumor suppression. Several mutations were
dominant negative, suppressing global PKC signaling output, and bioinformatic analysis

suggested that PKC mutations cooperate with co-occurring mutations in cancer drivers. These data
establish that PKC isozymes generally function as tumor suppressors, indicating that therapies
should focus on restoring, not inhibiting, PKC activity.

INTRODUCTION
The protein kinase C (PKC) family has been intensely investigated in the context of cancer
since the discovery that it is a receptor for the tumor-promoting phorbol esters (Castagna et
al., 1982). This led to the dogma that activation of PKC by phorbol esters promotes
carcinogen-induced tumorigenesis (Griner and Kazanietz, 2007), yet targeting PKC in
cancer has been unsuccessful.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The PKC family contains nine genes that have many targets and thus diverse cellular
functions, including cell survival, proliferation, apoptosis, and migration (Dempsey et al.,
2000). PKC isozymes comprise three classes: conventional (cPKC: α, β, γ), novel (nPKC: δ,
ε, η, θ), and atypical (aPKC: ζ, ι). cPKC and nPKC isozymes are constitutively
phosphorylated at three priming sites (activation loop, turn motif, and hydrophobic motif) to
structure PKC for catalysis (Newton, 2003). A pseudosubstrate segment maintains PKC in
an autoinhibited conformation that is relieved by second-messenger binding. cPKC
isozymes are activated by binding to diacylglycerol (DAG) and Ca2+, whereas nPKC
isozymes are activated solely by DAG, events that engage PKC at membranes. Thus, these
PKC isozymes have two prerequisites for activation: constitutive processing
phosphorylations and second-messenger-dependent relocalization to membranes. Prolonged
activation of cPKC and nPKC isozymes with phorbol esters leads to their dephosphorylation
and subsequent degradation, a process referred to as downregulation (Hansra et al., 1996;
Young et al., 1987). aPKC isozymes bind neither Ca2+ nor DAG.

PKC has proved an intractable target in cancer therapeutics (Kang, 2014). PKCι was
proposed to be an oncogene in lung and ovarian cancers (Justilien et al., 2014; Regala et al.,
2005; Zhang et al., 2006), and PKCε was categorized as an oncogene because of its ability
to transform cells (Cacace et al., 1993). However, for most PKC isozymes, there is
conflicting evidence as to whether they act as oncogenes or as tumor suppressors. For
example, PKCδ is considered a tumor suppressor because of its pro-apoptotic effects
(Reyland, 2007). However, it promotes tumor progression of lung and pancreatic cancers in
certain contexts (Mauro et al., 2010; Symonds et al., 2011). Similarly, both overexpression
and loss of PKCζ in colon cancer cells have been reported to decrease tumorigenicity in
nude mice or cell lines, respectively (Luna-Ulloa et al., 2011; Ma et al., 2013). Likewise,
PKCα was reported to both induce (Walsh et al., 2004; Wu et al., 2013) and suppress colon
cancer cell proliferation (Gwak et al., 2009) and to suppress colon tumor formation in the
APCMin/+ model (Oster and Leitges, 2006). Based on the dogma that PKC isozymes
contribute positively to cancer progression, many PKC inhibitors have entered clinical trials;
however, they have been ineffective (Mackay and Twelves, 2007). In fact, a recent metaanalysis of controlled trials of PKC inhibitors combined with chemotherapy versus
chemotherapy alone revealed that PKC inhibitors significantly decreased response rates and
disease control rates in non-small cell lung cancer (Zhang et al., 2014). Why has inhibiting

PKC failed in the clinic? It has been well established that prolonged or repetitive treatment
with phorbol esters depletes cPKC and nPKC isozymes from cells (Blumberg, 1980; Nelson
and Alkon, 2009), bringing into question whether loss of PKC, rather than its activation,
promotes tumorigenesis.
PKC is frequently mutated in human cancers. To uncover whether loss or gain of PKC
function contributes to cancer progression, we selected mutations throughout the primary
sequence and family membership and assessed their functional impact. Specifically, we
asked how these cancer-associated mutations alter the signaling output of PKC using our
genetically encoded reporter, C kinase activity reporter (CKAR) (Violin et al., 2003).
Characterization of 46 of these mutations revealed that most reduced or abolished PKC
activity and none were activating. Bioinformatic analysis of all PKC mutations revealed that
they may cooperate with co-occurring mutations in oncogenes and tumor suppressors known
to be regulated by PKC. Correction of one patient-identified, heterozygous, loss-of-function
(LOF) PKCβ mutation in a colon cancer cell line significantly decreased tumor size in
mouse xenografts, indicating that loss of PKC function enhances tumor growth. Our data are
consistent with PKC isozymes functioning generally as tumor suppressors, reversing the
paradigm that their hyperactivation promotes tumor growth.

RESULTS
A Multitude of Cancer-Associated Mutations Have Been Identified within the Nine PKC
Genes
554 mutations (as of October 2014), of which most are heterozygous, have been identified in
diverse cancers (Cerami et al., 2012; Gao et al., 2013) within cPKC (242), nPKC (236), and
aPKC (76) isozymes (Figure 1). These mutations reside throughout the entire coding region,
with no apparent mutational hot-spots. Therefore, we conducted a comprehensive study of
mutations within PKC domains and within interdomain regions to determine how they affect
PKC signaling to contribute to cancer pathogenesis. 46 mutations of both conserved and
non-conserved residues were selected from all three classes of PKC isozymes (Table 1 and
Table S1).
PKC Mutations in the Regulatory C1 and C2 Domains Are LOF

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The C1 domains of cPKC and nPKC isozymes are critical for their activation because they
mediate PKC translocation to membranes via binding to DAG. Thus, we investigated how
C1 domain mutations alter PKC translocation and activation. To measure agonist-dependent
PKC activity, COS7 cells co-expressing the FRET-based PKC reporter (CKAR) and equal
levels of either wild-type (WT) or mutant mCherry-tagged PKC were stimulated with the
cell-permeable DAG, DiC8, or the phorbol ester, phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDBu), and
phosphorylation-dependent FRET ratio changes were recorded. Phorbol esters serve as an
effective although non-physiological tool to maximally activate PKC because they bind with
100-fold higher affinity to C1 domains compared to DAG (Mosior and Newton, 1998). A
mutation identified in a colorectal cancer tumor altered a residue (PKCα H75Q) required for
coordination of Zn2+ and thus for folding of the C1 domain (Figure 2A). This mutation
ablated agonist-stimulated activity, as evidenced by a lower FRET ratio trace compared with

that of cells containing only endogenous PKC (Figure 2B). This lower agonist-induced
(Figure 2B) and basal activity (Figure S1A) suggests that the mutant is dominant negative
toward global PKC output. Within a head and neck cancer patient, a mutation altered a
critical residue (PKCα W58L) required for controlling the affinity for DAG, but not phorbol
ester (Dries et al., 2007) (Figure 2A). This mutation also abolished DiC8-induced activity
but retained some PDBu-induced activity, consistent with this residue selectively regulating
DAG affinity (Figure 2B). Because membrane translocation is a prerequisite for activation
of cPKC isozymes, we compared the translocation of YFP-tagged WT and mutant PKC to
membrane-targeted CFP using FRET (Antal et al., 2014). Mutation of either residue
impaired translocation upon stimulation with DiC8, phorbol ester (Figure 2C), or the natural
agonist UTP (Figure 2D), accounting for the inability of these agonists to activate the
mutants. Lastly, we asked how these mutations affected the processing phosphorylations of
PKC. PKCα H75Q, but not W58L, was unphosphorylated, likely because the misfolded
C1A domain of the H75Q mutant prevented its processing (Figure 2E). Three additional
mutations within the C1A domains of PKCα (G61W), PKCβ (G61W), and PKCγ (Q62H)
also exhibited reduced agonist-induced PKC activity (Figures S1B–S1D). Our analysis of
nine C1 domain mutations revealed that five reduced or abolished activity while none were
hyperactivating (Tables 1 and S1). Inactivation occurred by altering two key inputs required
for PKC function: disruption of binding to DAG or processing by phosphorylations.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The C2 domain of cPKC isozymes is also critical for activation, as it mediates Ca2+dependent pre-targeting to plasma membrane, where these isozymes bind DAG and become
activated (Newton, 2003). One mutation identified within the C2 domain of PKCγ (D193N)
was present in colorectal and ovarian cancers and in melanoma. Another (D254N) was
found in endometrial and ovarian cancers. Because both of these Asp residues (Figure 2F)
coordinate Ca2+ (Medkova and Cho, 1998), we monitored their activation upon elevation of
intracellular Ca2+ with thapsigargin, a sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase inhibitor
(Rogers et al., 1995). In contrast to WT PKCγ, neither mutant was activated (Figure 2G) nor
translocated to the plasma membrane (Figure 2H) following thapsigargin addition,
consistent with impaired Ca2+ binding. However, both mutants retained full responses to
phorbol esters, consistent with unimpaired C1 domains. To further substantiate the inability
of the mutants to bind Ca2+, we monitored PKC oscillatory translocation stimulated by
histamine-induced oscillatory Ca2+ release in HeLa cells (Violin et al., 2003). Whereas WT
PKCγ exhibited oscillatory translocation in some cells, the C2 domain mutants were
unresponsive to histamine (Figure 2I). Thus, these C2 domain mutations dampen PKCγ
activity because they impede Ca2+ binding. Mutation of two other C2 domain residues that
are not directly involved in Ca2+ binding (PKCγ T218M and PKCα G257V) also caused
LOF (Figure S1D and S1E); PKCα G257V was LOF because it was not processed by
phosphorylation (Figure S1F), whereas the remaining C2 domain mutants were (data not
shown). Our analysis of six C2 domain mutations revealed four LOF mutations and no
hyperactivating ones (Tables 1 and S1).
PKC Mutations in the Kinase Domain Are LOF
We next evaluated 21 kinase domain mutations, two of which were within PKCδ: D530G in
colorectal cancer and P568A in head and neck cancer (Figure 3A). Asp530 functions as an

anchor for the kinase regulatory spine, a highly conserved structural element of eukaryotic
kinases (Kornev et al., 2006; Kornev et al., 2008); not surprisingly, the D530G mutant was
kinase dead and not primed by phosphorylation (Figures 3B and 3C). Mutation of the
conserved Pro568 to Ala also prevented a response to natural agonist stimulation but
maintained some PDBu-stimulated activity, as a small pool of this mutant was
phosphorylated (Figures 3B and 3C).
Strikingly, all three PKCη mutations examined (K591E, R596H, and G598V) altered its
subcellular localization by pre-localizing it at the plasma membrane prior to stimulation
(Figure 3D). However, despite constitutive membrane association, these mutants had
reduced basal and stimulated activity as read out by a phospho-(Ser) PKC substrate antibody
(Figure 3E) because they were not processed by phosphorylation (Figure 3F). We have
previously shown that unprocessed nPKC isozymes have exposed C1 domains that induce
constitutive membrane association (Antal et al., 2014).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

A number of mutations were present within the highly conserved APE motif that is involved
in substrate binding and allosteric activation of kinases (Kornev et al., 2008). PKCγ P524R
and PKCβ A509V mutations ablated activity by preventing processing phosphorylations,
and both exhibited dominant-negative roles (Figures 3G–3J). PKCβ A509T (colorectal
cancer) also showed loss of function in response to UTP but was modestly activated by the
potent ligand PDBu (Figure 3I), likely because a small pool of it was phosphorylated (Figure
3J). A LOF mutation that prevented processing of the atypical PKCζ was also found within
the APE motif (E421K; Figure S1G).
Further analysis revealed that 16 out of 21 kinase domain mutations that we analyzed
(Tables 1 and S1) resulted in full or partial LOF, with the majority preventing processing by
phosphorylation. For example, PKCα F435C, PKCα A444V, PKCβII Y417H, PKCβII
G585S, and PKCγ G450C had impaired phosphorylation and reduced activity (Figures S1C–
S1F and S1H–S1J). However, partial LOF mutations were also observed in cases in which
phosphorylation was maintained—PKCα D481E (Figures S1B and S1F) and PKCγ F362L
(Figures S1D and S1J), suggesting that these mutations likely decrease PKC’s intrinsic
catalytic activity.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The Majority of Cancer-Associated PKC Mutations Are LOF
Our analysis of 46 mutations present within eight of the PKC genes revealed that ~61% (28)
of them were LOF and none were activating (Figure 4A). A lack of identification of
activating mutations is not an artifact of our assays, as activating PKC mutations that
increase PKC affinity for DAG or decrease autoinhibition are readily detectable (data not
shown). LOF mutations were identified within cPKC (α, β, γ), nPKC (δ, ε, η), and aPKC (ζ)
isozymes and occurred within the C1, C2, and kinase domains as well as the pseudosubstrate
and C-terminal tail (Figure 4B). For example, the PKCγ G23E pseudosubstrate mutation
was not processed by phosphorylation (Figure S1J) and thus lacked any UTP-stimulated
activity (Figure S1D), and the PKCε R162H pseudosubstrate mutation showed reduced
agonist-stimulated and basal activity (Figures S1K and S1L). The PKCβ P619Q C-terminal
tail mutation, residing within a conserved PXXP motif required for processing (Gould et al.,
2009), was also LOF as it prevented PKC phosphorylation (Figure S1H). Overall, PKC LOF

occurred by diverse mechanisms, most commonly by preventing processing
phosphorylations or ligand binding, and as such, there were no mutational hotspots for loss
of function. However, we identified seven LOF mutation “warmspots” (Sun et al., 2007) that
fell within highly conserved regions of PKC—one within the pseudo-substrate and six
within the kinase domain (Figure 4C). Thus, inactivating mutations targeted conserved
regulatory elements and frequently hit the same residue, whereas mutations that exhibited no
difference from WT occurred more randomly (Table S1).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Analysis of cancer types most frequently harboring PKC mutations revealed that, although
PKC isozymes are mutated across many cancers, PKC mutations are enriched in certain
cancers (Figure 4D). Namely, PKC isozymes are mutated in 20%–25% of melanomas,
colorectal cancers, or lung squamous cell carcinomas but are mutated in <5% of ovarian
cancers, glioblastoma, or breast cancers (Cerami et al., 2012; Gao et al., 2013). Additionally,
nPKC isozymes are most commonly mutated in gastrointestinal cancers (pancreatic,
stomach, and colorectal), which have a lower mutation burden than melanomas and lung
cancers, highlighting their importance in this type of cancer (Figure 4D). The majority of
PKC mutations are heterozygous, with an allele frequency varying from 0.05 to 0.67 for the
mutations characterized (Tables 1 and S1). This indicates that PKC mutations can be truncal
events in regards to tumor heterogeneity and exist in a majority of the cells within a tumor or
can be branchal events acquired later in tumorigenesis as the tumor progresses to a more
aggressive stage. This is consistent with PKC mutations being co-driver events that enhance
tumorigenesis mediated by primary drivers.
Dominant-Negative PKCβ Mutation Confers a Tumor Growth Advantage

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Because the majority of PKC mutations examined were LOF, we tested whether we could
rescue HCT116 colon cancer cells that have a heterozygous LOF frameshift mutation in the
C2 domain of PKCβ by overexpressing WT PKCβII. This resulted in a dramatic reduction in
anchorage-independent growth (Figure S2A), a hallmark of cellular transformation. Thus,
we next used CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing to ask whether reverting an
endogenous LOF allele to WT would also rescue cell growth. We used DLD1 colon cancer
cells because they harbor a PKCβ A509T LOF mutation (Figure 3I) to assess whether a
heterozygous LOF PKC mutation could confer a survival advantage, as most cancerassociated PKC mutations are heterozygous. We reverted the mutation to WT in three
isogenic clones (Figures S2B and S2C) and confirmed that no sequence alterations existed
within the top two most likely predicted off-targets (data not shown). Correction of the
A509T mutation in the endogenous PKCβ (PRKCB) allele caused a slight but reproducible
increase in the PKCβ levels and a >2-fold increase in PKCα levels, although neither reached
statistical significance (Figure 5A). Immunoblot analysis with a phospho-(Ser) PKC
substrate antibody revealed significantly higher basal PKC activity in the corrected cells
(Figure 5B). This is consistent with the DLD1 parental cells having reduced PKC activity
because of the LOF PKCβ mutation and the lower PKCα levels. We next tested the ability of
these cells to grow in suspension. Consistent with having higher PKC activity and a more
tumor-suppressive phenotype, the corrected cells were less viable in suspension (Figure 5C)
because they were less capable of forming compact multicellular aggregates as the DLD1
parental cells formed (Figure 5D). Moreover, the corrected clones had decreased anchorage-

independent growth potential (Figure 5E). These results corroborate those obtained from the
HCT116 cells overexpressing PKCβII, demonstrating that partial loss of PKCβ activity is
necessary for growth in soft agar. However, in a 2D proliferation assay, the DLD1-corrected
cells proliferated at similar rates to the DLD1 parental cells (Figure S2D), indicating that it
is not the proliferation rates that differ between these cells but, rather, their ability to grow in
the absence of anchorage.
To determine whether PKC displays haploinsufficiency, we knocked out the mutant PKCβ
allele in DLD1 cells by creating a frameshift deletion using genome engineering (Figure
S2E). This hemizygous clone (WT/-23), containing only one WT allele and thus expressing
lower PKCβII levels (Figure S2F), exhibited significantly increased anchorage-independent
growth potential compared to those containing two WT alleles, indicating that PKCβII is
haploinsufficient for tumor suppression (Figure 5E). Additionally, the PKCβ hemizygous
cells did not grow as well as the PKCβ A509T mutated cells in soft agar, indicating that this
mutation had a dominant-negative effect.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To definitively establish whether a heterozygous LOF PKCβ mutation facilitates tumor
growth in vivo, the DLD1 parental or corrected cells were subcutaneously injected into the
flanks of nude mice and tumor growth was monitored. Consistent with our cellular data, the
tumors derived from the corrected cells were significantly smaller than those from the DLD1
parental cells (Figures 5F and S2G). This reduced growth correlated with increased
apoptosis as assessed by TUNEL staining of tumor sections (Figure 5G). These data
demonstrate that a heterozygous, dominant-negative PKCβ mutation can significantly
increase tumor growth, thus establishing PKCβ as a tumor suppressor.

DISCUSSION

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Here we establish that clinical trials targeting PKC have been based on the wrong
assumption; it is not inactivation of PKC but, rather, activation that suppresses tumor
growth. Thus, we propose that therapies should target mechanisms to restore the PKC
signaling output rather than reduce it. Our comprehensive analysis revealed that 61% of the
PKC mutations characterized were LOF and none were activating. We did not account for
nonsense mutations or deletions, so an even higher proportion of PKC mutations are LOF.
Corroborating our data, three other LOF PKC mutations have been previously described. A
LOF PKCα mutation (D294G in C2 domain) was identified in three types of cancer (Alvaro
et al., 1993; Prévostel et al., 1997; Zhu et al., 2005) and a LOF PKCζ mutation (S514F in the
kinase domain) was identified in colorectal cancer (Galvez et al., 2009). A partial LOF
mutation in PKCι (R471C), present in three distinct cancers, disrupted substrate binding and
induced abnormal epithelial polarity (Linch et al., 2013). To our knowledge, no gain-offunction PKC mutations have been observed in cancer. The identification of LOF mutations
throughout the PKC family and in diverse cancers supports a general role for PKC isozymes
as tumor suppressors.
Strikingly, several LOF PKC mutations (e.g., PKCβ A509V, PKCγ P524R, and PKCα
W58L, H75Q, and G257V) acted in a dominant-negative manner by decreasing global
endogenous PKC activity. Moreover, the presence of mutant PKCβ A509T protein in DLD1

cells reduced PKCα levels. One mechanism for this cross-PKC dominant-negative effect is
that the LOF PKC impairs the priming phosphorylations of other PKCs, thus reducing their
steady-state levels. This is supported by a prior study demonstrating that unprocessed
kinase-dead PKC isozymes prevent the phosphorylation of other PKC isozymes, likely
because their phosphorylation requires common titratable components (Garcia-Paramio et
al., 1998). This dominant-negative role of LOF mutations is corroborated by studies
showing that kinase-dead PKC isozymes function in a dominant-negative manner to exhibit
tumorigenic effects on cells (Galvez et al., 2009; Hirai et al., 1994; Kim et al., 2013; Lu et
al., 1997). Importantly, although some PKC mutations were dominant negative, loss of PKC
such as would occur from nonsense mutations or gene deletions also conferred a growth
advantage (Figure 5E), indicating that PKC is haploinsufficient for tumor suppression.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

A tumor-suppressive role of PKC is supported by PKC gene knockout mouse models and
cellular studies. PKCα-deficient (Prkca−/−) mice knockout mice developed spontaneous
intestinal tumors (Oster and Leitges, 2006). In an APCMin/+ background, loss of PKCα
induced more aggressive tumors and decreased survival (Oster and Leitges, 2006), and in
the context of oncogenic Kras, PKCα deletion increased lung tumor formation (Hill et al.,
2014). Deletion of PKCζ in mice that are PTEN haploinsufficient resulted in larger, more
invasive prostate tumors and enhanced intestinal tumorigenesis in an APCMin/+ background
(Ma et al., 2013). Knockdown of PKCδ in colon cancer cells increased tumor growth in
nude mice (Hernández-Maqueda et al., 2013). Conversely, overexpression of PKC revealed
a protective role. Re-expression of PKCβI in colon cancer cells (Choi et al., 1990) or of
PKCδ in keratinocytes (D’Costa et al., 2006) or overexpression of PKCζ in colon cancer
cells (Ma et al., 2013) or in Ras-transformed fibroblasts (Galvez et al., 2009) decreased
tumorigenicity in nude mice.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Clinical data reveal lower PKC protein levels and activity in tumor tissue compared with
cognate normal tissue, also supporting a tumor-suppressive role for PKC. Total PKC activity
was significantly lower in human colorectal cancers versus normal mucosa because of
decreased PKCβ and PKCδ (Craven and DeRubertis, 1994) or PKCβ and PKCε protein
levels (Pongracz et al., 1995). PKCα protein was downregulated in 60% of human colorectal
cancers (Suga et al., 1998), and PKCζ was downregulated in renal cell carcinoma (Pu et al.,
2012) and non-small cell lung cancer (Galvez et al., 2009). Decreased PKCβ and PKCδ
levels correlated with increased grade in bladder cancer (Koren et al., 2000; Langzam et al.,
2001; Varga et al., 2004), and decreased PKCδ levels correlated with increased grade in
endometrial cancer and glioma (Reno et al., 2008; Mandil et al., 2001). PKCη was
downregulated in colon and hepatocellular carcinomas, and lower PKCη expression was
associated with poorer long-term survival (Davidson et al., 1994; Lu et al., 2009). However,
increased PKCι protein and DNA copy number levels have been observed in certain cancers
(Perry et al., 2014; Regala et al., 2005). PKCι is part of the 3q26 amplicon, and its increased
DNA copy number levels correlate with increased mRNA expression (Figure S3). However,
DNA copy number and mRNA levels do not correlate for cPKC genes (Figure S3). In fact,
for PKCα, copy number levels inversely correlate with protein levels in breast cancer
(Myhre et al., 2013), the cancer in which PKCα is most amplified (Cerami et al., 2012; Gao
et al., 2013). A number of studies reported increased mRNA expression of other PKC genes

in cancer; however, mRNA expression and protein levels often poorly correlate (Myhre et
al., 2013). Thus, clinical data of this sort are consistent with a tumor-suppressive function of
PKC isozymes, although there might be context specific exceptions for PKCι.
The recent discovery that germline LOF mutations in PKCδ are causal drivers of
autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome and systemic lupus erythematosus, disorders
associated with the acquisition of cancer-associated phenotypes, supports a bona fide tumorsuppressive role of PKC in humans (Belot et al., 2013; Kuehn et al., 2013; Salzer et al.,
2013). Both diseases are characterized by increased proliferation and decreased apoptosis of
B cells (Belot et al., 2013; Kuehn et al., 2013), and patients frequently develop lymphomas
(Bernatsky et al., 2005; Mellemkjaer et al., 1997). Moreover, we found that siblings
homozygous for a LOF PKCδ mutation have reduced levels of PKCζ (data not shown),
supporting a dominant-negative role of LOF mutations.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

How could decreased PKC activity enhance tumorigenesis? One possibility is that PKC
isozymes suppress oncogenic signaling by repressing signaling from oncogenes or
stabilizing tumor suppressors. Supporting this, unbiased bioinformatic analysis of tumor
samples harboring PKC LOF mutations revealed that TP53 (p53) is one of most frequently
mutated genes in tumors harboring LOF mutations for each PKC isozyme (Table 2). PKC
might promote the tumor-suppressive function of p53 by stabilizing the WT protein.
Considerable evidence suggests that phosphorylation by PKCδ stabilizes p53, thus
promoting apoptosis (Abbas et al., 2004; Yoshida et al., 2006), but the role of other PKC
isozymes is less clear. KRAS was also among the top ten genes mutated in cancers harboring
PKC mutations for seven of the PKC isozymes (Table 2), specifically with mutation at
Gly12 (Table S3). This argues that PKC might suppress Kras signaling, such that loss of
PKC would be required for Kras to exert its full oncogenic potential. Consistent with this,
PKC modulates both the activity and localization of Kras through phosphorylation of Ser181
(Bivona et al., 2006). Although the role of this phosphorylation site in tumors remains
controversial (Barceló et al., 2014), our analysis is consistent with loss of PKC enhancing its
oncogenic potential. In fact, the DLD1 and HCT116 cells used in our assays contained an
oncogenic Kras mutation (G13D) that is necessary for the ability of these cells to grow in
soft agar (data not shown). This suggests that LOF PKC mutations are not major cancer
drivers but, rather, co-drivers that contribute to cancer progression.

We also analyzed which kinase or cancer census genes (genes implicated in cancer) are
significantly more commonly mutated (>15-fold) in tumors harboring PKC mutations versus
tumors lacking PKC mutations (Table S4). This allowed us to identify proteins that might be
important co-drivers or represent novel genetic dependencies for PKC. The tumor
suppressor LATS2, which inhibits the Hippo pathway, and the kinases ROCK1 and ROCK2,
which are required for the anchorage independent growth and invasion of non-small cell
lung cancer cells, were among the top 20 mutated proteins that were significantly enriched
in tumors harboring PKC mutations (Table S4). Our analysis reveals that gain-of-function
mutations in these genes might be required to promote tumorigenesis in the absence of PKC
signaling. We also performed an analysis of cancer-specific genes frequently co-mutated
with PKC in lung cancer, colorectal cancer, or melanoma. This revealed very little overlap
in co-mutated genes between the three cancers and also between the three classes of PKC

isozymes (Table S5), suggesting that the individual PKC isozymes regulate distinct
pathways in different cancers. Interestingly, cancers with a high PKC mutation burden, such
as melanoma and colorectal cancers, show little PKC amplification. Conversely, cancers that
have higher PKC amplification rates, such as breast and ovarian cancers, have few PKC
mutations (Cerami et al., 2012; Gao et al., 2013), consistent with PKC mutations having a
smaller or different role in breast and ovarian cancers.

The foregoing data provide a mechanism for why inhibiting PKC has proved unsuccessful
and, in fact, detrimental in cancer clinical trials: it is not gain of function but, rather, LOF
that confers a survival advantage. Therefore, therapeutic strategies should target ways to
restore PKC activity. Bryostatin-1, a PKC agonist, also failed as a therapeutic and, in fact,
exhibited counter-therapeutic effects in cervical cancer (Nezhat et al., 2004), likely because
it downregulates PKC (Szallasi et al., 1994). Therefore, strategies to activate PKC without
downregulating it hold significant clinical potential. An important ramification of this study
is that drugs that inhibit proteins involved in the processing of PKC cause loss of PKC.
Notably, both mTOR and HSP90 inhibitors, currently in use in the clinic (Don and Zheng,
2011; Neckers and Workman, 2012), prevent processing of PKC (Gould et al., 2009;
Guertin et al., 2006) and would thus have the detrimental effect of removing its tumor
suppressive function. Restoring PKC activity would have to accompany other
chemotherapeutics, given that PKC isozymes act as the brakes, not the primary drivers, to
oncogenic signaling. Our finding that decreased PKC activity enhances tumor growth
challenges the concept of inhibiting PKC isozymes in cancer and underscores the need for
therapies that restore or stabilize PKC activity in cells.

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
FRET Imaging and Analysis
Cells were imaged as described previously (Gallegos et al., 2006). For activity
measurements, cells were co-transfected with the indicated mCherry-tagged PKC and
CKAR or plasma membrane-targeted CKAR, as indicated. For translocation experiments,
cells were co-transfected with the indicated YFP-tagged PKC and membrane-targeted CFP.
Generation of CRISPR Cell Lines

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The CRISPR/Cas9 genome-editing system was employed to generate DLD1 cell lines in
which the PKCβ A509T mutation was reverted to WT or knocked out. For the nuclease
method, DLD1 cells were transiently transfected with the hSpCas9 vector containing the
gRNA PKCβ-a, the PAGE-purified 70-mer ssODN (Figure S2B), and pMAX-GFP. For the
double nickase method, DLD1 cells were transfected with two hSpCas9n vectors containing
either gRNA PKCβ-a or PKCβ-b, the ssODN, and pMAX-GFP. GFP+ cells were sorted 72
hr later. To reduce off-target mutagenesis, one of the clones (WT/ WT 53) was made using a
double-nicking approach that requires the ooperation between two nickase Cas9 enzymes
(Ran et al., 2013). CRISPR-targeted clones were expanded and gDNA was extracted using a
Quick-gDNA MiniPrep Kit (Zymo Research Corporation) and were screened for the
presence of two wild-type alleles by PCR using primers spanning the A509 locus, followed
by restriction digest with BtgZI. This restriction site was only present in the WT allele, and

correction of the A509T mutation introduced this site into the other allele. The presence a
WT allele at both loci was confirmed by Sanger sequencing (Eton Bioscience).

Xenograft Model
Athymic Nude-Foxn1nu mice (Harlan) were housed in compliance with the University of
California San Diego Institutional Animal Core and Use Committee. 3 × 106 DLD1 cells in
100 μl PBS were injected subcutaneously into the right flank of each 4-week-old female
mouse. Tumor dimensions were recorded twice weekly and tumor volume was calculated as
1/2 × length × width2. Mice were euthanized 43 days after injection, and tumors were
excised. One tumor was excluded, as it did not engraft well (DLD1p), and another was
excluded, as it was not subcutaneous (WT/WT 31).

Highlights

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

•

Cancer-associated PKC mutations are LOF and can act in a dominant-negative
manner

•

Correcting a heterozygous PKCβ LOF mutation reduces tumor volume

•

Hemizygous deletion shows PKC is haploinsufficient for tumor suppression

•

Therapeutic strategies should aim to restore PKC activity instead of inhibiting it
