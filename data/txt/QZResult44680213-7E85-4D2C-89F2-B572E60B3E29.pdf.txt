BACKGROUND: Diabetes is an emerging public health issue in the US, affecting 11% of Americans over the age of 20,
with long-term complications that include cardiovascular disease, retinopathy, neuropathy, and nephropathy. A recent
meta-analysis found that bladder cancer incidence was approximately 40% higher in individuals with diabetes; however, few studies considered duration or type of therapy and had limited adjustment for potentially confounding factors. METHODS: To further investigate the potential role of diabetes in risk of bladder cancer, the authors analyzed
data from a case-control study conducted in New Hampshire in which patients with bladder cancer, and controls
sampled from the population, completed an interview regarding history of diabetes, cigarette smoking history, height,
weight, and history of urinary tract infections. RESULTS: The study consisted of 331 cases and 263 controls on whom
information regarding diabetes was ascertained. History of diabetes was related to an increased bladder cancer risk
(adjusted odds ratio ¼ 2.2, 95% CI, 1.3 to 3.8). The association was strongest in those who had diabetes for the longest duration (OR for 16 or more years ¼ 3.6, 1.1 to 11.2) and in those taking oral hypoglycemic medications (OR ¼ 3.3,
1.5 to 7.1). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support an association between bladder cancer incidence and diabetes, and
further suggest that the risk may be greater among patients taking oral hypoglycemics and those with diabetes of

Diabetes is an emerging public health issue in the US, affecting 11% of Americans over the age of 20,1 with longterm complications that include cardiovascular disease, retinopathy, neuropathy, and nephropathy. In addition, diabetes
has been implicated as a risk factor for certain malignancies, including cancers of the liver, colon, and pancreas.2-5
Bladder cancer is the sixth most common cancer in the United States.6 Several potential risk factors have been identified for this cancer, including tobacco use, occupational exposure to aromatic amines and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, drinking water contaminants (such as disinfectation byproducts and arsenic), and treatment with
cyclophosphamide.7 A meta-analysis of epidemiologic studies suggested an increased risk of bladder cancer in relation to
diabetes.8 The meta-analytic odds ratio was 1.4 (95% CI, 1.0-1.8) from 7 case-control studies, 1.4 (1.2 -1.7) from 3
cohort studies, and 1.0 (0.9 -1.1) from 6 studies comparing cohorts of diabetics with external populations. In the metaanalysis, only 3 of the 16 studies examined the differential impact of diabetes therapies, and only 2 considered duration of
diabetes. The greatest potential confounding factor, smoking, was considered in only half of these studies, whereas
body mass index (BMI) was only used in 3 of the 16. A history of urinary tract infections (UTI) is also a potential confounder9-11; however, none of the 16 studies in the meta-analysis adjusted for UTIs.
To further investigate the potential role of diabetes in risk of bladder cancer, we analyzed data from a case-control
study conducted in New Hampshire in which controls and patients with bladder cancer completed an interview regarding
diabetes history, UTIs, and cigarette smoking, as well as current height and weight (from which to compute BMI).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
A detailed description of the study design appears in earlier reports.12 Briefly, newly diagnosed, histologically confirmed bladder cancer cases were identified by the New
Hampshire State Department of Health and Human
Services’ Cancer Registry. These cases included New
Hampshire residents, aged 25-74 years, first diagnosed
between July 1, 1998 and December 31, 2001. The data
quality and completeness of this registry meet the standards of the North American Association of Central Cancer
Registries.13,14 During the study period, the registry was
estimated to capture greater than 90% of incident cancers
in New Hampshire. Of the 472 potentially eligible cases
that were contacted, a total of 398 (84%) were interviewed. For efficiency, we shared a control group with a
study of nonmelanoma skin cancer in New Hampshire
covering a diagnostic period of July 1, 1997 to March 30,
2000. Controls younger than 65 years were selected using
population lists obtained from the New Hampshire
Department of Transportation. Controls 65 years and
older were chosen from data files provided by the Centers
for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) of New Hampshire residents. Cases and controls were eligible if they
were English-speaking New Hampshire residents ages 2574, with a working telephone number. A total of 526 controls (76%) were interviewed from a potential 694 confirmed as eligible participants. Participating controls did
not appreciably differ by age or sex from those who
declined to participate (data not shown).
Consenting participants underwent a personal interview covering socio-demographic factors (eg, level of
education), lifestyle characteristics (eg, use of tobacco
products), and medical history prior to the reference date
(diagnosis date for cases and comparable date for controls). Cases and controls were coded as having a history
of UTIs if they answered yes to either of the questions,
‘‘Did you ever have a bladder infection?’’ and ‘‘Did you
ever have a kidney infection?’’
As part of their medical history, participants were
asked, ‘‘Have you ever been told by a physician that you
have diabetes?’’ Those who responded ‘‘yes’’ were asked
about age at diagnosis and type of treatment (eg, use of insulin and oral hypoglycemic medications before the reference date). Duration of diabetes was determined as the
difference in reference age and age at diagnosis. Questions
regarding diabetes were phased into the study; consequently, of the 398 cases and 526 controls who were interviewed, 331 cases and 263 controls had the diabetes
questions administered.

BMI obtained for 260 controls and 122 of cases.

We used logistic regression to calculate the odds
ratios for bladder cancer in relation to history of diabetes.
Bladder cancer was regressed on diabetes with and without adjustment for age, gender, smoking status, BMI, and
UTI. To account for missing BMI data, we used multiple
imputation,15 whereby BMI was randomly imputed using
a linear regression of BMI on diabetes, age, gender, smoking, and UTI. In addition to history of diabetes (yes/no),
we computed odds ratios by duration of diabetes and type
of diabetes treatment. We did not collect data on type of
diabetes ( type 1 vs type 2) and were unable to stratify on
age at onset of diabetes because less than 1% of the cases
and the controls had developed diabetes during childhood
(defined as onset before age 18 years). Therefore, we
examined the association with diabetes both including
and excluding those diagnosed during childhood.

RESULTS
Overall, there were a greater proportion of males, smokers, and those with a history of urinary tract infections
among the cases than in the controls (Table 1), but cases
and controls were similar with respect to BMI.
A history of diabetes was reported in 21% of the
bladder cancer cases and 10% of the controls (Table 2)
(unadjusted OR ¼ 2.4; 95% CI, 1.4-3.9). The odds ratio
remained the same when the 3 individuals with childhood-onset diabetes were excluded. The proportion of
subjects who had diabetes treated by diet only was similar
in cases and controls (OR ¼ 1.2; 95% CI, 0.5-3.2). In
contrast, diabetes treated by oral hypoglycemic drugs or

insulin was associated with an increased risk of bladder
cancer (OR for oral hypoglycemic drugs ¼ 3.3; 95% CI,
1.7-6.9 and OR for insulin ¼ 2.2; 95% CI, 0.9, 5.5). The
odds of bladder cancer were somewhat higher among
those with longer duration of diabetes: compared with
those without diabetes, those with diabetes of 16 years or
more had an unadjusted OR of 3.6 (95% CI, 1.2-11.1),
whereas among those with a duration of 5-15 years the
unadjusted OR was 2.1 (95% CI, 1.0-4.5), and among
those with a duration of less than 5 years the adjusted OR
was 2.4 (95% CI, 1.1-5.2). Adjustment for age, gender,
smoking, BMI (by multiple imputation), and UTI did
not substantially alter the odds ratios (Table 2). Type of
diabetes treatment and duration of diabetes are related
variables. Of those who reported having diabetes for 16 or
more years, 62% took insulin, compared with 32% of
those with a duration of 5-15 years and 3% of those with a
duration less than 5 years. After adjustment for duration,
use of oral hypoglycemics remained significantly associated with risk of bladder cancer (adjusted OR ¼ 7.5, 95%
CI, 1.6-36.1); the adjusted odds for use of insulin did not
change (data not shown). We considered more detailed
smoking variables than the ones reported in Table 1
(number of years smoked, average cigarettes smoked per
day) and for each the adjusted odds ratio was within 10%
of the estimates reported in Table 2. When we restricted
our analysis to cases and controls for whom BMI was
available, there were no appreciable differences in the
crude and adjusted odds ratios for diabetes and diabetes

duration (data not shown). In subgroup analyses, we did
not observe appreciable differences in the ORs for diabetes by age or sex (data not shown). The magnitude of the
association with diabetes was stronger for noninvasive
cancer (adjusted OR ¼ 2.8, 1.6-4.9) than invasive cancer
(adjusted OR ¼ 1.5, 0.7-3.2); however, this difference
could have been due to pure chance.

DISCUSSION
Our findings suggest an association between history of diabetes and bladder cancer risk in New England. We
detected an increased risk for individuals with diabetes
using either oral or insulin therapy, but not for individuals
with diabetes using diet therapy alone. Furthermore, risk
was highest among those with the longest duration of
diabetes.
The overall adjusted odds ratio of 2.2 (95% CI, 1.33.8) in our study is higher than, although consistent with,
the findings of a recent meta-analysis.8 Aside from methodologic or population differences, heterogeneity of
results could be from differences in duration of diabetes
or treatment, both of which were associated with risk of
bladder cancer in our study.
A recent prospective study of 45,000 Swedish men
followed for over 9 years, of whom 414 developed bladder
cancer, found bladder cancer incidence to be 1.2 times
higher in men reporting a history of diabetes, but this
was not statistically significant.16 This and another

prospective study of over 100,000 Japanese adults with up
to 10 years of follow-up were not included in the metaanalyses. In the Japanese cohort, in which 105 developed
bladder cancer, a history of diabetes was associated with a
60% increase in bladder cancer among men and 40%
decrease among women, Again, these findings were not
statistically significant.5 Neither the meta-analysis, nor
the Swedish or Japanese studies, were stratified by diabetes
treatment or adjusted for urinary tract infections.
While a unique aspect of our study is that we
adjusted for UTI in light of evidence of an association
with bladder cancer and diabetes,10,11,17 this adjustment
did not substantially alter the odds ratios. Indeed, adjusting for all covariates did not alter the odds ratios by more
than 10%. Because obesity has been associated with bladder cancer risk,8,18 we attempted to adjust for BMI, which
was available for a subset of our cases and controls (unlike
the majority of the 16 studies reported in the meta-analysis). In our study BMI was elevated in cases compared
with controls, but not significantly, and adjustment for
BMI did not alter the odds ratio for bladder cancer associated with diabetes.
Insulin has been hypothesized to be a cancer growth
promoter, which could explain an increased cancer risk in
adults with type 2 diabetes2,19 Type 2 diabetes is characterized by an extended period of elevated endogenous insulin levels, which compensates for insulin resistance.
Fasting blood glucose (FBG) and postchallenge glucose
levels also have been investigated in relation to bladder
cancer risk, but with mixed results. Risk of bladder cancer
was 1.6 times higher for those with FBG above 126 mg/
dL, compared with those with less than 90 mg/dL in a
prospective study from Korea,20 although this was not
statistically significant. In contrast, a similarly designed
cohort study of over 140,000 Austrians found no doseresponse association of postchallenge glucose load with
bladder cancer, or all cancers combined.21 In another
cohort study, impaired glucose tolerance was found to not
be associated with bladder cancer.4 Thus, further mechanistic data are needed.
In our study, subjects who reported having diet-controlled diabetes had no apparent increased risk, compared
with subjects without diabetes. The reason for this is not
known. Aside from simply serving as a better measure of
diabetes itself (ie, diminishing misclassification), it raises
the possibility that the association between bladder cancer
and diabetes may arise from treatment for diabetes. In our
study, subjects who reported taking oral hypoglycemics
had the highest risk, followed by those who reported tak-

ing insulin. Most of those classified as taking insulin likely
received oral hypoglycemics before they began insulin
therapy, as this is the usual course in type 2 diabetes (the
predominant form of diabetes). There is some evidence
that a common anti-diabetic drug, metformin (a biguanide), may reduce cancer risk, whereas sulfonylureas may
increase risk.2 Where there has been some interest in thiazolidinediones as chemopreventive agents, a recent study
in rats found that rosiglitazone increased the incidence of
bladder cancer.22 A cross-sectional study of individuals
with diabetes found that use of rosiglitazone was associated with self-reported history of cancer.23 In addition,
the increased cancer risk in diabetics taking insulin in our
study could be ascribed to the possible cancer growth promoting effect of insulin.2 Conversely, such treatment
could be a marker for severity of disease. Clearly, further
data are needed to understand this association more fully.
Greater than 90% of individuals with diabetes have
type 2, and this form of diabetes is believed to have multiple etiologies, including obesity.24 Type 1 diabetes is an
autoimmune disease with an unknown trigger, characterized by a younger age at onset and insulin dependence.
Individuals with type 2 diabetes may also take insulin. Of
the 95 individuals with diabetes in our study, only 3
reported being diagnosed during childhood; it is likely,
however, that some of those diagnosed as adults have type
1 diabetes.
Thus, a limitation of our study is our inability to discriminate between type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Another limitation is use of self-reported diabetes and the potential
for misclassification, although evidence suggests that selfreported diabetes has good agreement with medical
records.25,26 As diabetes is not a known cause of bladder
cancer, the possibility of differential recall (ie, between
cases and controls) seems unlikely. We attempted to minimize reporting bias by asking subjects about their type of
diabetes treatment. Indeed, stronger associations were
observed among those treated with oral agents and, to
some extent, insulin. As we did not have information on
glucose levels or other markers of glucose control, we were
unable to assess whether the increased risk of bladder cancer found among those receiving oral anti-diabetic drugs
or insulin was because of the medication, or if the medication was a marker for more severe diabetes. In addition,
we did not have detailed drug information, which precluded our ability to examine dose or specific type of therapy (eg, for oral agents). Finally, we adjusted for BMI
using multiple imputation. (BMI was measured in only
about one-third of the cases because of the absence of

1555

Original Article

BMI in the first wave of data collection.) Missing data and
multiple imputation do not cause bias because a missing
BMI was not informative.15 Moreover, BMI did not
appear to be a strong bladder cancer risk factor in our
data.
In conclusion, we found that risk of bladder cancer
was elevated among those patients with a history of diabetes—in particular, those taking oral hypoglycemics or insulin. In addition, this association increased with duration
of diabetes. More research is needed to determine the differential effects of diabetes medications and diabetes severity on the pathogenesis of bladder cancer.
