ABSTRACT
Novel biomarkers predicting prostate cancer (PCa) aggressiveness and docetaxel
therapy response of PCa patients are needed. In this study the correlation between
nuclear Eg5-expression, PCa docetaxel response and PCa aggressiveness was
assessed. Immunohistochemical staining for nuclear Eg5 was performed on 117
archival specimens from 110 PCa patients treated with docetaxel between 2004 and
2012. Samples were histologically categorized as positive/negative.
Median follow-up time from diagnosis was 11.6 years. Nuclear Eg5-expression
was significantly related to docetaxel response (p=0.036) in tissues acquired within
three years before docetaxel initiation. Nuclear Eg5-expression was not related to
Gleason-score (p=0.994). Survival of patients after docetaxel initiation did not differ
based on nuclear Eg5-expression (p=0.540). Analyzing samples taken before hormonal
therapy, overall survival and time to docetaxel use were significantly decreased in
patients with nuclear Eg5-expressing tumors (p<0.01). Eg5-positive nuclei were found
more frequently in T4-staged tumors (p=0.04), Gleason 8-10 tumors (p=0.08), and
in metastasized tumors (p<0.01). Multivariate analyses indicated that nuclear Eg5expression may be an independent parameter for tumor aggressiveness. Limitations
of a retrospective analysis apply.
In conclusion, nuclear Eg5-expression may be a predictive biomarker for
docetaxel response in metastatic castrate-resistant PCa patients and a prognostic
biomarker for hormone-naive PCa patients. Prospective validation studies are needed.

INTRODUCTION

patients progress during or after docetaxel, usually within
few months after their last cycle. As docetaxel inhibits
depolarization of microtubules regardless of cell type [9],
toxicities may be severe, such as polyneuropathy and bone
marrow suppression [2]. To prevent or restrict unnecessary
docetaxel use, and to determine the optimal treatment
sequence for individual mCRPC patients [10], biomarkers
predicting docetaxel response need to be identified and
implemented in clinical practice [11].

Metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer
(mCRPC) is the second deadliest cancer in men in the
Western world [1]. Primary first-line therapy for most
mCRPC patients consists of the taxane docetaxel with
prednisone [2;3], although various other mCRPC therapies
have recently been introduced [4-8]. About 48% of patients
initially respond to docetaxel therapy [2]; eventually all

We hypothesized that nuclear Eg5 (Kindle Spindle
Protein/KSP/KIF11/kinesin-5) may be such a marker. Eg5
separates spindle poles of a mitotic cell by crosslinking
two antiparallel microtubules and moving to the plus-ends
of both microtubules [12]. Due to its essential function in
mitosis, multiple Eg5-inhibitors have been developed for
anti-cancer therapy, such as ispinesib [13]. Two studies
with ispinesib focused particularly on mCRPC patients,
with ambiguous results. In a phase I study, six out of
fourteen mCRPC patients had stable disease (SD) for
≥18 weeks and one patient had a prostate-specific antigen
(PSA)-decrease of >50% when ispinesib was combined
with docetaxel in mCRPC patients [14]. In a phase II study
in which ispinesib was administered as monotherapy, no
responses were reported [15]. Twenty out of 21 patients
had been treated with docetaxel prior to ispinesib.
Immunohistochemistry analysis on archival tumor tissue
from sixteen patients indicated that only one tumor
stained positive for Eg5. It was concluded that ispinesib
is not effective in primary prostate cancer (PCa) due to
their low mitotic index, resulting in low Eg5 expression.
However, considering their similar mechanism of action,
an alternative explanation could be that cross-resistance
occurs between docetaxel and Eg5-inhibitors.
Recent studies indicate that Eg5 may also play a
role in intracellular transport in the cytoplasm, suggesting
that Eg5-inhibitors may target Eg5 expressing non-mitotic
cells too [16;17]. Xing et al. analyzed archival specimens
from 80 patients with clinically localized PCa; half
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

stained positive for Eg5, while benign prostate cells did
not express Eg5 [18]. Considering the low mitotic index
of PCa cells regardless of disease stage [19], these data
suggest that Eg5 may indeed be expressed in non-mitotic
PCa cells too [20].
Combining aforementioned findings [14;15;18],
initial Eg5 expression of PCa may have been decreased
once tumors have become docetaxel resistant. This led to
our hypothesis that Eg5 may be a predictive marker for
docetaxel response. Based on recent findings that patients
with high Gleason-scores respond better to taxane-based
therapy [21], we further hypothesize that Eg5 may be a
prognostic marker for tumor aggressiveness and clinical
outcome.

RESULTS
Patient and tissue characteristics
In total, 117 samples were collected from 110
mCRPC patients. These patients had been diagnosed
with PCa between 1994 and 2011 and treated with
docetaxel between July 15th, 2004 and December
24th, 2012. Median time to follow-up from date of PCa
diagnosis was 11.6 years (interquartile range 8.7-14.2
years). Clinicopathological parameters are listed in Table
1. Median age of patients when diagnosed with PCa
was 64 years. Median Gleason-score of tumors was 8.

About two-thirds of patients had ≥2 measured metastatic
localizations when docetaxel was initiated. Of note, tumor
imaging methods such as CT-scans were not performed
in all patients, underestimating the number of metastatic
lesions. All patients had been medically and/or surgically
castrated. In general, patients had been heavily pretreated:
patients had received up to five therapies before docetaxel
therapy.
For immunohistochemistry, tonsil and healthy
prostate tissue served as positive and negative controls,
respectively (Fig. 1A-B). Obtained PCa tissue consisted
primarily of biopsies (70.0%) (Table 1, supplementary
Fig. 1). In the tumor samples, a clear distinction was
observed between samples with nuclear Eg5 staining
(5.1%), cytoplasmic Eg5 staining (19.7%), and samples
staining positive for Eg5 in both compartments (63.2%),
irrespective of the samples’ age (Fig. 1C-F). Samples
were scored for nuclear or cytoplasm staining separately.

Interobserver agreement of scoring was 98.1%.

and

Eg5 expression varied in tumors from some patients
who had multiple biopsies taken before docetaxel therapy.
This variability always reflected a disappearance of
Eg5 expression over time. It is unknown whether these
changes occurred as the tumor evolved spontaneously
or due to other therapies, such as androgen-deprivation
therapy. Therefore, correlation between Eg5 expression
and docetaxel response was evaluated for all patients
(n=110) as well as for patients with samples taken
within three years before docetaxel start (n=61). A clear
trend was observed between nuclear Eg5 expression
and a better response to docetaxel therapy (Fig. 2A,

is more patient death in the group with Eg5-negative tumors.

Supplementary Fig. 2). This correlation was significant in
patients from whom tissue was taken within three years
before docetaxel initiation: 71.9% of these patients with
nuclear Eg5 expression had a PR versus 36.4% of patients
without nuclear Eg5 expression (p=0.036). Conversely,
cytoplasmic or any Eg5 expression did not predict
docetaxel response (Supplementary Fig. 3).
As a previous report identified Gleason-scores as
a predictive marker for docetaxel response, it was tested
whether a correlation existed between Gleason-score
and docetaxel response in our set of patient samples
(Supplementary Table 1). Gleason-score was not related
to docetaxel response, neither in all patients (p=0.343) nor
in patients with tissue available in the three years before
docetaxel initiation (p=0.884). Furthermore, Gleasonscore and nuclear Eg5 expression were not related in this
latter subpopulation (p=0.994), suggesting that nuclear
Eg5 expression was an independent marker of docetaxel
response.
We further explored the correlation between
docetaxel response and Eg5 expression by investigating
patients who had a PCa sample taken before and after

docetaxel treatment. Only five patients matched these
criteria. While cytoplasmic Eg5 expression did not alter
in these patients, three out of four tumors with positive
Eg5 nuclei before docetaxel therapy did not have nuclear
Eg5 expression after docetaxel treatment (Supplementary
Figure 4). These three patients had progressive disease
upon discontinuation of docetaxel. On the other hand,
the patient whose tumor expressed nuclear Eg5 pre- and
post-docetaxel discontinued docetaxel therapy due to
unacceptable toxicities. Despite the small patient number,
these results suggested that loss of nuclear Eg5 expression
may be related to docetaxel resistance.
Intriguingly, although patients with nuclear Eg5
expression had a better response to docetaxel (Fig. 2A),
no difference in OS, calculated from the start of docetaxel
therapy to death, was evident between tumors based on
nuclear Eg5 expression (p=0.540) (Fig. 2B).

Immunohistochemical nuclear Eg5 expression
and tumor aggressiveness

expressing class III beta-tubulin were relatively insensitive
to PCa therapy: class III beta-tubulin expression resulted
in faster recurrence after radical prostatectomies, a
decreased docetaxel response and decreased survival [26].
Unfortunately, none of these markers are available yet for
use in clinical practice [11]. Additional studies, such as the
one we present here, are needed to identify a biomarker
that is related to docetaxel response in PCa patients.
In the current study, we found that nuclear Eg5
expression in PCa was associated with improved antitumor
efficacy of docetaxel, independently of patient’s Gleasonscore. Furthermore, we identified nuclear Eg5 as a
prognostic marker in hormone-naive PCa patients: patients
whose tumor expressed nuclear Eg5 had a decreased
median OS and progressed more rapidly to mCRPC.
Similar findings were reported in non-small lung cancer
patients: patients with Eg5 expressing tumors had a better
response to chemotherapy, but a lower OS [27]. Similarly,
Eg5 expression was related to worse clinical outcome in
renal cell carcinoma patients [28].
Once docetaxel was initiated, survival of mCRPC
patients was similar irrespective of nuclear Eg5
expression. This may indicate that nuclear Eg5 expressing
tumors initially respond well to docetaxel, resulting
in decreased patient mortality. However, once these
Eg5 expressing tumors progress, these tumors behave
more aggressively, increasing patient death. This trend
could indeed be derived from the survival curve (Fig.
2B) and might explain why survival of patients with
nuclear Eg5 expression is not increased after docetaxel
treatment despite responding better to docetaxel therapy.
Alternatively, other factors may have resulted in the
similar survival curve, such as unequal patient and
treatment characteristics between groups other than Eg5
expression.
Nuclear Eg5 expression could provide a useful tool
for clinical practice. Interobserver agreement between
researchers was very high (98.1%), as no subjective
degrees of positive staining (mild/moderate/strong) were
used. Positive/negative scoring requires little interpretation
from the pathologist. Determination of Eg5 expression at
the time of diagnosis would be non-invasive, as tissue
material is already acquired. Additional tissue sampling
once the mCRPC stage has been reached could aid the
physician in deciding when to initiate docetaxel therapy.
Patients whose tumor expresses nuclear Eg5 may benefit
by early docetaxel treatment; patients with Eg5-negative
tumors may be recommended to initiate other therapies
first, as docetaxel response is more limited.
In the current study, a retrospective design was
chosen, resulting in several limitations. FFPE PCa
samples were collected from pathology archives; these
samples were taken for diagnostic purposes (biopsies) and
consisted of residual materials from surgical procedures
such as TUR-P or radical prostatectomies. Therefore,
the sample set we created was heterogeneous in origin.

We evaluated whether tumors with nuclear Eg5
expression behaved more aggressively. Analyzing samples
from all 110 patients, patients with tumors with nuclear
Eg5 expression had a significantly decreased OS (median
6.6 versus 4.7 years, p=0.046) (Fig. 3A). Time from
diagnosis to symptomatic mCRPC was also decreased
(median 4.0 versus 2.8 years, p=0.037) (Fig. 3B). When
selecting samples from hormone-naive patients (n=87),
differences in OS and time to symptomatic mCRPC
were even more pronounced (p=0.010 and p=0.006,
respectively) (Fig. 3C-D). In this subset of patients,
nuclear Eg5 expression was related to Gleason-score
(p=0.014) and TNM classification (tumor stage, p=0.052;
any metastases, p=0.007; distant metastases, p=0.021); no
correlation existed between nuclear Eg5 expression and
age (Fig. 4).
Multivariate analyses were performed to test
whether the correlation between nuclear Eg5 expression
and tumor aggressiveness (OS and time to symptomatic
mCRPC) remained evident when correcting for potential
confounding variables, such as Gleason-score (Table 2).
When including all patients, addition of most covariates
resulted in no statistically significant correlation between
nuclear Eg5 expression and OS or time to symptomatic
mCRPC. This included correction for age, while this
variable was neither related to nuclear Eg5 expression nor
to prognosis, suggesting the study was underpowered for
such analyses. However, a trend towards positive nuclear
Eg5 expression and aggressive tumors was evident. When
assessing hormone-naive patients, a clearly positive
trend existed between nuclear Eg5 expression and tumor
aggressiveness regardless of the covariate added (hazard
ratio >1.75), suggesting a potential independent prognostic
value for nuclear Eg5 expression. The correlation between
nuclear Eg5 expression and time to symptomatic mCRPC
was significant in all subgroup analyses, except when
metastases (N1 and/or M1) were added as a covariate
(p=0.063).

DISCUSSION
Research has been ongoing identifying prognostic
biomarkers and biomarkers predictive for therapy response
in PCa with improved accuracy compared to established
biomarkers such as serum PSA levels and Gleason-score,
with some success [11]. Urokinase plasminogen activator
and its inhibitor PAI-1, and Ki-67 have been identified
as potential prognostic biomarkers of PCa [22;23].
Cytoplasmic localization of the androgen-receptor and
increased blood serum levels of Macrophage Inhibitory
Cytokine 1 (MIC-1) have been identified as a potential
marker for PCa docetaxel response [24;25]. PCa tumors

METHODS

However, on the contrary to other tumors such as breast
cancer, only limited tissue material is available from PCa
patients during their disease, as many patients have a
prostatectomy early in their disease and primarily suffer
from bone metastases, which are not easily accessible.
Furthermore, additional tissue sampling is often not
needed, as it currently would not influence further
therapy decisions. Therefore, although our initial patient
number was relatively large, only limited tissue material
was available from patients shortly before docetaxel
initiation. Hence all samples taken within three years of
docetaxel initiation were collected for analysis. This led
to a heterogeneous cohort of samples (both biopsies and
residual surgical material), representing various stages of
PCa disease. Furthermore, patients may have received
various treatments between tissue sampling and docetaxel
initiation. E.g., antiandrogen treatment significantly
changed gene expression profiles of prostate cancer [29].
It is unknown whether such treatment specifically affects
nuclear Eg5 expression. To overcome these challenges, a
prospective study will be needed in which tissue will be
collected shortly before docetaxel initiation to confirm the
correlation between nuclear Eg5 expression and docetaxel
response. However, such a study will need to overcome
ethical and practical challenges as well.
In addition, our patient population was
underpowered for multivariate analyses in hormone-naive
patients. Further prospective studies are warranted to
validate whether nuclear Eg5 expression may serve as an
independent prognostic biomarker.
Previous studies found that PCa patients with
aggressive tumors respond well to docetaxel, but also
respond better to cabazitaxel, suggesting that aggressive
tumors respond well to taxanes in general [30;31].
Therefore, additional studies are needed to assess whether
Eg5 predicts response to cabazitaxel too. Finally, our
study results suggest that loss of Eg5 expression may be
related to docetaxel resistance. Although ispinesib had
limited antitumor efficacy after docetaxel, our study and
previous phase I findings suggest that ispinesib may be
effective when administered before or concomitantly with
docetaxel, when up to 70% of tumors express nuclear
Eg5 [14]. However, combination therapy with docetaxel
would need direct comparison to docetaxel monotherapy.
Eg5-inhibitors may provide further clinical benefit
when selecting mCRPC patients based on nuclear Eg5
expression (personalized medicine).
In conclusion, nuclear Eg5 expressing PCa is
aggressive, but responds well to docetaxel. Loss of
nuclear Eg5 expression may be associated with docetaxel
resistance. Determining nuclear Eg5 expression in PCa
samples may aid to improve timing to initiate docetaxel
therapy in individual PCa patients. Additional prospective
studies are needed to confirm the predictive and prognostic
value of nuclear Eg5.

Collection of patient material and data
Formalin fixed and paraffin embedded (FFPE)
human PCa samples (biopsies, transurethral resections
of prostate (TUR-P) or radical prostatectomies), stored
at room temperature, were collected from pathology
archives of Leiden University Medical Center, Reinier de
Graaf Gasthuis and Erasmus Medical Center Rotterdam.
mCRPC patients who had pathological material available
taken before docetaxel therapy were included. The study
was carried out in accordance with the Dutch code of
conduct for the secondary use of human tissues; informed
consent was therefore not required when enough material
remained to serve the patient’s and family’s needs [32].
Additional patient information was collected anonymously
in a database. Approval was obtained from the Medical
Ethics Board (METC) of Leiden University Medical
Center (P12.219).

Immunohistochemistry
Samples (3µm sections) were stained for Eg5 using
a polyclonal Anti-Eg5 antibody (1:1500, HPA006916,
Sigma-Aldrich) on an automated immunohistochemistry
stainer (Ventana Benchmark Ultra) (Fig. 1). This stainer
utilized the ultraView Universal DAB Detection Kit
(760-500, Ventana) for visualization of antibodies.
The kit consisted of various enzyme labeled secondary
antibodies that bind to primary antibodies; the complex
was visualized with hydrogen peroxidase substrate and
a 3.30-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (DAB)
chromogen. For antigen retrieval, ULTRA CC1, an
EDTA-Tris pH 8.4 solution, was used (950-224, Ventana).
Representative images were taken at 20x10 under an
Olympus BX41 microscope (Olympus Optical Co., Ltd.)
from each slide using a colorview IIIu camera (Olympus),
and analyzed with Cell^B imaging software (version
2.4108-181207). If an image was representative for the
whole slide, only one picture was taken; otherwise, three
representative views were imaged per slide.

Data analysis
Images were examined and scored blindly and
independently by two researchers (MDW, ESdM). A clear
contrast between nuclear and cytoplasmic Eg5 staining
was evident (Fig. 1). Recent studies have indicated
that intracellular functions of Eg5 may differ based on
its subcellular localization [17]; not all functions may
be related to docetaxel response. Therefore, samples
were scored for positive or negative staining of nuclei,

cytoplasm or any cellular compartment (nucleus and/or

Samples were considered positive when in one highpower field of view (20x10) at least four cancer cells were
positive, regardless of intensity. This cut-off value ensured
that random mitotic cells, infrequently found in the
negative control too, were excluded. For analysis, average
scores from both observers were calculated. If >50% of
all scores per sample were positive for Eg5, the sample
was considered Eg5-positive; otherwise it was considered
Eg5-negative.

This study was supported by Leiden University and
Erasmus Medical Center, Rotterdam. JTB was supported
by a grant from the  Dutch Organization for Scientific
Research (NWO, VENI-Grant 916.131.10).

Clinical endpoints

REFERENCE LIST

Clinical endpoints used in this study include survival
from docetaxel initiation, overall survival (OS), time to
symptomatic mCRPC and best therapy response.
Time to symptomatic mCRPC was defined as time
between PCa diagnosis and docetaxel initiation. OS was
calculated as time between diagnosis and patient death. If
patients had not died or were lost to follow-up, survival
was censored at the day the patient was last known to be
alive before July 20th, 2013.Tumor aggressiveness was
based on OS, time to symptomatic mCRPC, Gleasonscore, and TNM-classification. Determination of best
disease response (progressive disease, partial response)
followed PCa working group guidelines as described
previously, and could indicate PSA response and/
or response as viewed on imaging such as computer
tomography [30;33].

Statistical analyses
Microsoft Excel 2003 was used for basic statistical
analyses; student’s t-tests were conducted for comparisons.
SPSS (version 20) was used for the Kaplan-Meier analyses
of survival and time to symptomatic mCRPC; log-rank
tests were used to compare these parameters between
groups. Multivariate analyses were performed using the
Cox-regression model. P-values ≤0.050 were considered
statistically significant.
