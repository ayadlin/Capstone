ABSTRACT
Anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) is one of the most aggressive human
malignancies, with no effective treatment currently available. Previously, we identified
agents active against ATC cells, both in vitro and in vivo, using quantitative highthroughput screening of 3282 clinically approved drugs and small molecules. Here,
we report that combining two of these active agents, carfilzomib, a second-generation
proteasome inhibitor, and CUDC-101, a histone deacetylase and multi-kinase inhibitor,
results in increased, synergistic activity in ATC cells. The combination of carfilzomib
and CUDC-101 synergistically inhibited cellular proliferation and caused cell death
in multiple ATC cell lines harboring various driver mutations observed in human
ATC tumors. This increased anti-ATC effect was associated with a synergistically
enhanced G2/M cell cycle arrest and increased caspase 3/7 activity induced by
the drug combination. Mechanistically, treatment with carfilzomib and CUDC-101
increased p21 expression and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase protein cleavage. Our
results suggest that combining carfilzomib and CUDC-101 would offer an effective
therapeutic strategy to treat ATC.

INTRODUCTION

genetic abnormality and substantial aberrant expression
of numerous molecules in ATC, leading to dysregulation
of multiple signaling pathways [11]. Therefore, targeted
therapies, which interfere with only one or a few specific
molecule(s), may not offer effective ATC treatment.
Recently, using quantitative high-throughput
screening (qHTS) on 3,282 clinically approved drugs
and small molecules, we identified several agents that
are active in ATC cells, both in vitro and in vivo [2326]. Among these were carfilzomib, a second-generation
proteasome inhibitor, and CUDC-101, an inhibitor of
HDACs and multiple kinases. It has been reported that,
in colorectal cancer cells, the combination of HDACs
and proteasome inhibitors results in superior antitumor
activity, accompanied by the altered gene expressions
associated with cell cycle arrest and apoptosis [27]. Since
ATC tumors have a high degree of genomic and genetic
abnormality, we hypothesized that targeting multiple
altered pathways simultaneously may improve therapeutic
efficacy and reduce the effective concentration needed
for each drug, thus lessening their potential toxicities.
Therefore, we tested the combination of carfilzomib and

Anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) is a rare, but
very aggressive, human malignancy. The approximate
incidence of ATC is one to two cases per million per year,
but the median survival of ATC patients is only about five
months [1-3]. Current treatment regimens fail to provide
durable clinical benefits, and patient survival has not
been improved in over six decades [1, 2, 4]. Thus, there
is an urgent need to develop new, effective treatments to
improve ATC patient survival.
To identify therapeutic targets for this lethal
disease, extensive genomic and genetic studies have
been performed. ATC tumors frequently have mutations
in TP53, BRAF, RAS, β-catenin, PIK3CA, and PTEN [511]. Overexpression of epidermal growth factor receptor
(EGFR), histone deacetylases (HDACs), β-catenin, aurora
kinases, cyclins, platelet-derived growth factor receptor
beta (PDGFRB), survivin, and HER-2 are also common
[12-20]. Moreover, both the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK and
PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways are activated in ATC [21,
22]. These findings suggest that there is a high degree of

RESULTS

CUDC-101 as a potential therapeutic strategy in ATC cells.
We found that by concurrently inhibiting the proteasome,
HDACs, EGFR, and HER2 pathways, the combination of
carfilzomib and CUDC-101 synergistically inhibited tumor
cell proliferation in multiple ATC cell lines with driver
mutations observed in human ATC tumors. The superior
anti-ATC activity of the drug combination was associated
with synergistically enhanced G2/M cell cycle arrest and
caspase-dependent apoptosis. Mechanistically, treatment
with carfilzomib and CUDC-101 induced increased p21
expression and augmented poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase
(PARP) protein cleavage. Collectively, our results support
the combination of carfilzomib and CUDC-101 as a
promising ATC treatment strategy.

Carfilzomib potentiates the anti-ATC activity of
CUDC-101
To examine the effects of carfilzomib and CUDC101 in combination on ATC cell proliferation, time-lapse
video microscopy was used to continuously monitor 8505c
cell growth in vehicle control, carfilzomib and CUDC-101
individually, and carfilzomib and CUDC-101 combined
groups over a 48 h time span. Figure 1 shows the screen
capture images from 1-, 12-, and 48 h-treatments.
Compared to vehicle control cells, carfilzomib at 6 nM
inhibited 8505c cell growth, and induced cell death after
48 h of treatment. At a 0.8 µM concentration, CUDC101decreased 8505c cell proliferation, and induced cell
death after 48 h of treatment. Remarkably, when the

same concentrations of carfilzomib and CUDC-101 were
combined, cancer cell death increased to a level greater
than those attributed to the individual drugs. After 48-hour
incubation, most cells in the group treated with carfilzomib
and CUDC-101 were dead, with cellular debris evident.
Time-lapse microscopy recorded over 48 h showed similar
cell viability changes (Supplemental Data).
Molecular heterogeneity within tumors is one of
the major reasons that anticancer drugs are restricted in
their efficacy. To investigate whether the combination of
carfilzomib and CUDC-101 would be effective in ATC
cells that harbor different driver mutations, we tested the
drug combination using five different ATC cell lines, each
with distinct genetic backgrounds. 8505c cells have BRAF
V600E, EGFR, and TP53 mutations; C-643 cells have
HRAS, TP53, and PTEN mutations; SW-1736 cells have
BRAF V600E, TP53, and PIK3CB mutations; THJ-16T
cells have TP53, RB, and PI3KCA mutations; and THJ-29T
cells have an RB mutation [23, 28]. The mutations present
in these cell lines are frequently observed in ATC tumors,
suggesting that they are a good representation of human
ATC. In all cell lines tested, the addition of carfilzomib
increased CUDC-101 cell proliferation inhibition, and the
effect was observed across all carfilzomib concentrations
tested (Figure 2A). Furthermore, we confirmed the
proteasome inhibitor effect of carfilzomib by measuring
the accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins after treatment
(Figure 2B). The accumulation of ubiquitinated protein

was higher with carfilzomib and CUDC-101 treatment
than carfilzomib treatment alone (Figure 2B).
To examine whether the carfilzomib and CUDC101combination is additive or synergistic, we used the
approach of Chou and Talalay to calculate the combination
index (CI), in which CI = 1 indicates an additive effect,
CI < 1 a synergistic effect, and CI > 1 an antagonistic
effect [29]. As shown in Table 1, for all five ATC cell
lines, the calculated CIs were less than one for all
tested concentrations, indicating a synergistic effect of
carfilzomib and CUDC-101, in combination, on cellular
proliferation inhibition.

Carfilzomib increases CUDC-101-induced cell
cycle arrest and apoptosis in ATC cells
We next examined the underlying mechanism for
the increased ATC cell death induced by the combination
of carfilzomib and CUDC-101. To study this, we tested
two representative ATC cell lines, 8505c and C-643. We
first assessed cell cycle progression in the cells when
treated with the different agents individually. As we
reported previously, either carfilzomib or CUDC-101
alone induced cell cycle arrest in G2/M phase (Figure
3) [23, 24]. In 8505c control cells, 17.3% of the cells
were in G2/M phase, and treatment with carfilzomib or
CUDC-101 increased the percentage to 37.9% and 39.6%,

cells. Representative FACS data show that the combination of carfilzomib and CUDC-101 increase G2/M cell cycle arrest.

respectively. Similarly, in C-643 cells, 18.7% of the cells
in the vehicle control group were in G2/M phase, and
treatment with carfilzomib or CUDC-101 increased the
percentage to 30.3% and 34.6%, respectively. Remarkably,
the addition of carfilzomib to CUDC-101, in both 8505c
and C-643 cells, resulted in a more than 100% increase
of cells in G2/M phase when compared to the individual
carfilzomib or CUDC-101 treatment groups, suggesting
that the drugs synergistically inhibited cell cycle

progression in ATC cells.
Caspases play a critical role in inducing apoptosis
to cause cell death. To test whether the combination of
carfilzomib and CUDC-101 had a synergistic effect on
caspase-dependent apoptosis, we performed caspase 3/7
activity assays. In 8505c cells, 4-nM carfilzomib or 0.4µM CUDC-101 treatments resulted in a 31% and 100%
increases in caspase 3/7 activity, respectively. Adding
carfilzomib to CUDC-101 led to an almost 300% increase

were also observed at higher drug concentrations, as well
as in C-643 cells (Figure 4).

treatment decreased cyclin B1 expression in both 8505c
and C-643 cells. The effects of therapy with carfilzomib
and CUDC-101 combined on cyclin B1 expression were
similar to those of CUDC-101 treatment alone, suggesting
that cyclin B1 did not play an important role in the
synergistic effect induced by the drug combination (Figure
5). Similar results were also observed for aurora kinase A
and survivin, excluding these proteins from any important
role in the drugs’ synergistic functions (Figure 5).
P21 is an important cell cycle regulator. Therefore,
we examined the effect(s) of carfilzomib and CUDC-101
individually, as well as in combination, on p21 expression.
P21 protein was undetectable in vehicle control-treated
8505c and C-643 cell lines, which matches the aggressive
cellular phenotype of ATC. Carfilzomib treatment had
no effect on p21 expression in 8505c cells, but it did
induce the expression of p21 in C-643 cells, which was
consistent with the higher sensitivity of C-643 cells to

Combination of carfilzomib and CUDC-101 acts
synergistically to increase p21 expression and
cleaved PARP levels in ATC cells
To understand the mechanism behind how
carfilzomib and CUDC-101 synergistically regulate ATC
cell proliferation, cell cycle progression, and apoptosis,
we examined several key signaling molecules involved
in these cellular functions. Cyclin B1 is an important
regulatory protein involved in mitosis. Carfilzomib
treatment had no significant effect on cyclin B1
expression in 8505c cells, but did result in increased cyclin
B1expression in C-643 cells. In contrast, CUDC-101

DISCUSSION
With our improved understanding of the driver
genetic changes involved in cancer initiation and
progression, researchers have developed many targeted
anticancer therapies. However, the development of drug
resistance is common, and many targeted agents show
efficacy in only a limited patient population. Lethal
cancers, such as ATC, contain multiple mutated genes
and dysregulated pathways. Therefore, these tumors
are or become resistant to many targeted treatments by
bypassing the level and/or factor inhibited by a specific
inhibitor [30]. To achieve clinical efficacy, simultaneously
inhibiting multiple cancer cell pathways may offer a better
treatment strategy. In this study, we evaluated the potential
of carfilzomib and CUDC-101 in combination for the
treatment of ATC. As previously reported, carfilzomib or
CUDC-101 alone displayed an antiproliferative effect in
ATC, while the combination of the two drugs profoundly
augmented this effect. Our results demonstrated that
combining carfilzomib with CUDC-101 synergistically
inhibited ATC cell proliferation, enhanced G2/M
cell cycle arrest, and increased cancer cell apoptosis.
Mechanistically, combining carfilzomib and CUDC-101
resulted in increased p21 expression and PARP cleavage,
demonstrating the molecular basis for the enhanced
synergistic effect of the drug combination in ATC therapy.
The ubiquitin proteasome pathway is involved in
cancer initiation and progression, and angiogenesis in
thyroid cancer [31]. Proteasome inhibition has emerged
as a new therapeutic option for cancer treatment [32].
Bortezomib, a first generation proteasome inhibitor,
has been tested for the treatment of both hematological
and solid cancers, including ATC [33, 34]. However,
drug resistance and neurotoxicity associated with
bortezomib treatment has restricted its clinical efficacy
[35]. Carfilzomib is an irreversible inhibitor of the 20S
proteasome. Compared to bortezomib, carfilzomib induces
a more sustained inhibition of cellular proteasome activity
[36]. We have recently shown that carfilzomib is an
effective anticancer agent in ATC. Carfilzomib treatment
significantly inhibited ATC cell proliferation, and resulted
in G2/M cell cycle arrest and caspase-dependent apoptosis.
Carfilzomib treatment in mice with established, widely
metastatic disease significantly increased their survival
[24].
CUDC-101 is a dual inhibitor of EGFR, HER2,
and HDACs, and displays potent antiproliferative and
proapoptotic activities against cancer cells [37, 38]. A
Phase I study of CUDC-101 reported that the drug was
tolerable and showed some preliminary evidence of
antitumor activity [39]. Through qHTS of 3282 clinically
approved drugs and drug candidates in ATC cell lines,
we recently demonstrated that CUDC-101 is one of the

carfilzomib than that of 8505c cells. CUDC-101 treatment,
as previously observed, increased p21 levels in both 8505c
and C-643 cells. Carfilzomib significantly potentiated
the CUDC-101-induced p21 expression, resulting in the
dramatic overexpression of p21 protein (Figure 5).
PARP plays a pivotal role in the detection and repair
of DNA damage, and is critical for cancer cell survival
and growth when cells are under genotoxic stress. PARP
is the primary cleavage target of caspase-3, and serves as
a marker of cellular apoptosis. As shown in Figure 5, when
used as a single agent, either carfilzomib or CUDC-101
was able to induce a slight increase in PARP cleavage.
Adding carfilzomib to CUDC-101 resulted in dramatically
enhanced cleavage of PARP in both 8505c and C-643
cells, which explains the synergistic effect of the drug

top active agents against ATC [23]. CUDC-101 inhibited
ATC cell proliferation, and resulted in cancer cell death
by inducing cell cycle arrest and caspase-dependent
apoptosis. Furthermore, using an in vivo metastatic
ATC mouse model, we found that CUDC-101 treatment
inhibited tumor growth and metastases, and significantly
prolonged animal survival [23].
Like other aggressive cancers, ATC tumors
frequently contain multiple genetic mutations, including
TP53, BRAF, RAS, β-catenin, PIK3CA, and PTEN [511]. The overexpression of EGFR, HDACs, β-catenin,
aurora kinases, cyclins, PDGFRB, survivin, and HER2 are also common in ATC [12-20]. The high degree of
genetic abnormality and the substantial dysregulated
expression of tumor suppressive or growth promoting
genes observed in ATC may explain why it has been such
a challenge to develop an effective therapeutic strategy for
patients with ATC when only a single or a few of these
dysregulated genes/pathways are targeted. Indeed, a Phase
II trial of pazopanib, a potent multi-targeted receptor
tyrosine kinase inhibitor, reported that in patients with
ATC, the drug induced only transient disease regression
in some of the patients, without any confirmed partial or
complete responses [40]. In combination with paclitaxel,
efatutazone, an oral PPAR-γ agonist, has been reported
to induce a partial response in one out of 15 patients in
a Phase I trial in patients with ATC [41]. Similarly, the
combination of carboplatin and paclitaxel (CP) and
fosbretabulin, a vascular-disrupting agent, did not show a
significant difference in progression-free survival between
CP and CP/fosbretabulin-treated patients with ATC [42].
Therefore, simultaneous inhibition of multiple pathways
that are dysregulated in ATC may be necessary to achieve
effective therapies for ATC.
Combinations of proteasome inhibitors and other
targeted agents have been tested for use in cancer therapy.
In imatinib-sensitive and -resistant chronic myeloid
leukemia models, carfilzomib showed a synergistic effect
in combination with tyrosine kinase inhibitors [43]. In
acute myeloid leukemia cells, proteasome inhibitors could
reverse the quizartinib resistance induced by FLT3 kinase
domain mutations, suggesting that these compounds
may prevent the emergence of mutant clones arising
from tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatments [44]. In nonsmall cell lung cancer cell lines, carfilzomib combined
with HDAC inhibitor SAHA demonstrated synergistic
anticancer activity [45]. In the current study, we found that
the combination of carfilzomib and CUDC-101 induced
synergistic anti-ATC activity. The drug combination
increased p21 expression and PARP cleavage, and resulted
in increased cell cycle arrest and cancer cell apoptosis.
Although we did not test the drug combination in an in
vivo model of ATC, we have previously reported that
carfilzomib and CUDC-101 treatment results in potent
anticancer activity in vivo. In the current study, our focus
was to evaluate the effects of the drug combination in vitro
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

and to determine the mechanism of the synergistic effects.
In conclusion, we demonstrate that by targeting the
HDACs, proteasomes, and EGFR downstream signaling
pathways, the combination of carfilzomib and CUDC-101
offers an effective treatment strategy that synergistically
inhibits ATC cell proliferation and causes ATC cell death.
Since the combination is effective in multiple ATC cell
lines that contain major genetic mutations observed in
ATC tumors, the present findings provide a rationale to
investigate the combination of carfilzomib and CUDC-101
as a potential therapy for ATC.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell lines
Human ATC cell line 8505c was purchased from the
European Collection of Cell Cultures (Salisbury, United
Kingdom); C-643 and SW-1736 were obtained from Cell
Lines Service (GmbH, Eppelheim, Germany); and THJ16T and THJ-29T were kindly provided by Dr. John A.
Copland (Department of Cancer Biology, Mayo Clinic,
Jacksonville, FL) and have been described previously
[23]. All cell lines were authenticated using short tandem
repeat profiling. 8505c cells have BRAF V600E, EGFR,
and TP53 mutations; C-643 cells harbor HRAS, TP53, and
PTEN mutations; SW-1736 has BRAF V600E, TP53, and
PIK3CB mutations; THJ-16T has TP53, RB, and PI3KCA
mutations; and THJ-29T has an RB mutation [28]. Cells
were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium
(DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum
(FCS), penicillin (100 U/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ ml),
Fungizone (250 ng/ml), TSH (10 IU/l), and insulin (10 μg/
ml) in a 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C.

Cell proliferation assay
Cell proliferation assays were performed in 96well plates in quadruplicate. Cells were plated in 96well black plates at 2×103 cells/well in 100 μl of culture
medium. After 24 h (day 0), 100 μl of fresh culture medium
containing double concentrations of the indicated drug(s)
or vehicle control were added to each well. CyQUANT
(Invitrogen) proliferation assays were performed
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The cell
numbers in the 96-well black plates were determined
using a 96-well fluorescence microplate reader (Molecular
Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) at 485 nm/538 nm.

Cell cycle assay
Cells were plated in T25 flasks at a density of
4×105 (8505c) or 3×105 (C-643) cells/flask in 4 ml of

culture medium. After 24 h, 4 ml of fresh culture medium
containing double concentrations of the indicated drug(s)
or vehicle control were added to each flask. Following
a 24-h treatment, the cells were harvested, washed and
resuspended in PBS, and fixed with ice-cold 70% ethanol
at 4 °C. After washing with PBS, ribonuclease A and
propidium iodide (PI) were added to the cell suspension,
which was then incubated at 37 °C for 20 min in the dark.
A total of 20 000 nuclei were examined by flow cytometry
using a CANTO II flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson,
Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA). Doublets, cell clumps, and
debris were excluded using PI fluorescence pulse width
and pulse area measurements. Cell cycle analysis on the
gated PI distribution was performed using Modfit software
(Verity Software House, Inc., Topsham, ME, USA).

8505C cells were plated in 35-mm coverslip, glassbottomed culture dishes (MatTek, Ashland, MA) at a
density of 2.5×104 cells/dish in 2 ml of culture medium.
After 24 h (day 0), 1 ml of culture medium was removed
from the dish, and 1 ml of fresh culture medium containing
double concentrations of the indicated drug(s) or vehicle
control were added. The plates were then loaded into
Olympus VivaView incubator (Center Valley, PA), and
bright-field time-lapse images of cells were taken in a
temperature- and humidity-controlled environment every
10 min for 48 h using a UPLSAPO40X objective with a
0.5X magnification changer.

Statistical analyses

Apoptosis assay

Two-sided t-tests were used to assess differences in
the Caspase-Glo 3/7 and cell proliferation assay results.
A p value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
GraphPad Prism 6 (La Jolla, CA) and CompuSyn
(ComboSyn, Inc, New York, NY) were used for statistical
analysis.

To determine whether drug treatment resulted in
apoptosis, we used the Caspase-Glo 3/7 assay (Promega)
to measure caspase activity. 8505c and C-643 cells were
plated in white 96-well plates at a density of 2×103 cells/
well in 100 μl of culture medium. After 24 h (day 0), 100 μl
of fresh culture medium containing double concentrations
of the indicated drug(s) or vehicle control were added to
each well. After 48 h, cells were analyzed for caspase 3/7
activity using the Caspase-Glo 3/7 assay kit according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. The relative luminescence
(which is proportional to caspase 3/7 activity) was
calculated and normalized to the total cell number.
