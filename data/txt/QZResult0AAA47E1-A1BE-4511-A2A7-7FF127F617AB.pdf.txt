ABSTRACT
The aim of this study was to investigate the protective effects of matrine on
lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammation and oxidative stress in vivo and
in vitro. The results showed that matrine improved intestinal inflammatory status
and oxidative balance and enhanced chemokine receptor 7 (CCR7) expression. In
LPS-challenged mice and Caco-2 cells, matrine alleviated LPS-induced inflammation
and oxidative stress via downregulating pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β and
IL-17) and malondialdehyde (MDA) production. CCR7-siRNA transfection blocked
the protective effects of matrine on LPS-induced inflammation and oxidative stress
and exacerbated LPS caused injury. In conclusion, matrine alleviates LPS-induced
intestinal inflammation and oxidative stress in mice and Caco-2 cells, which may be
associated with CCR7 signal.

INTRODUCTION

enzymes, such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione
peroxidase (GSH-Px), and catalase (CAT) [5]. Furthermore,
matrine and its derivatives have displayed anticancer
activity, antiviral activity, analgesic effect, anti-fibrotic
activity, insecticidal activity, and antimicrobial activity [1].
Chemokine receptors (CCR) and their ligands play
an important role in coordination of cell trafficking in
many biological processes, especially for inflammation
and oxidative stress [6]. However, there are little
references about matrine and chemokine receptors
mediated inflammation and oxidative stress. Thus, in
this study, we used lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to induce
inflammation and oxidative stress in mice and Caco2 cells to investigate the protective role of matrine in
LPS-induced inflammation and oxidative stress and the
potential mechanism of chemokine receptors.

Matrine, a quinolizidine alkaloid component of
the Chinese herb, isolates from the roots of Sophora
species, such as Sophora flavescens (Kushen), Sophora
tonkinensis, and Sophora alopecuroides (Kudouzi) [1].
Various reports have suggested that matrine exhibits antiinflammatory and antioxidant effects and may serve as a
therapeutic potential for inflammation and oxidative stress
relative diseases [2,  3]. For example, matrine alleviates
cytokines production, inflammatory cell infiltration, and
goblet cell differentiation by downregulating suppressor of
cytokine signaling 3 and inhibiting nuclear factor kappa-B
(NF-κB) signal in airway epithelial cells and asthmatic
mice [4]. In the focal cerebral ischemic injury, matrine
improves antioxidant activity via increasing antioxidant

RESULTS

Matrine alleviates LPS-induced intestinal
inflammatory response in mice and Caco-2 cells

Matrine improves inflammatory status and
antioxidant function in mice

LPS was used to induce intestinal inflammation in
mice and the results showed that LPS injection markedly
caused intestinal inflammatory response evidenced by the
increased cytokines (IL-1β, IL-10, IL-17, and TNF-α)
(P < 0.05) (Table 4). However, dietary 10 mg/kg matrine
treatment exhibited an anti-inflammatory function in LPSchallenged mice via reducing intestinal IL-17 expression
(P < 0.05). Meanwhile, IL-1β in the jejunum and IL-10
in the ileum also tended to be decreased after matrine
exposure (P > 0.05) (Table 4).
Caco-2 cells were incubated with different dosages
of matrine (0, 0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 0.5, 1, 2 and 5 mM)
and LPS (0, 10, 50, 100, and 200 μM) and we selected
0.5  mM matrine and 100 uM LPS for the following
analysis according to the cell viability (Figure 1A and 1B).
Meanwhile, we found that 0.5 mM matrine treatment
markedly alleviated LPS-caused reduction in cell viability
(P < 0.05) (Figure 1C). We further tested cellular cytokines
(i.e. IL-1β, IL-10, IL-17, and TNF-α) after exposure to
matrine (Figure 1D–1G) and LPS and the results showed
that LPS markedly enhanced cellular IL-1β, IL-10, IL-17,
and TNF-α production (P < 0.05), while matrine reduced
LPS-induced IL-1β and IL-17 generation (P < 0.05).

Jejunal and ileal mRNA abundances IL-1β, IL-10,
IL-17, and TNF-α were determined in this study (Table 1).
In the jejunum, 10 mg/kg matrine significantly
downregulated IL-1β expression compared with the
control group (P < 0.05). In addition, matrine tended
to influence IL-10 and TNF-α expression, while the
difference was insignificant (P > 0.05). In the ileum, IL-1β
was markedly lower in 10 mg/kg matrine group and IL-17
was downregulated in 5 and 10 mg/kg matrine groups
compared with the control group (P < 0.05).
SOD, total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC), and
malondialdehyde (MDA) have been widely served as
oxidative makers. In this study, we found that dietary
matrine (5 and 10 mg/kg) significantly enhanced jejunal
and ileal T-AOC activities and MDA abundance was
marked lower in 10 mg/kg matrine group than that in the
control group (P < 0.05) (Table 2).

Matrine activates intestinal chemokine receptors
in mice
Chemokine receptors are widely involved in
inflammatory response, thus intestinal expressions of
CCR2, CCR5, CCR6, CCR7, and CCR7 were tested
(Table  3). In the jejunum, 5 mg/kg matrine enhanced
CCR7 expression and 10 mg/kg matrine markedly
upregulated CCR5, CCR6, and CCR7 expressions
compared with the control group (P < 0.05). In the ileum,
dietary matrine (1, 5, and 10 mg/kg) increased CCR7
mRNA level and 10 mg/kg matrine markedly enhanced
CCR2, CCR5, and CCR7 expressions (P < 0.05).

Matrine alleviates LPS-induced intestinal
oxidative stress in mice
LPS-challenged mice exhibited a marked oxidative
injury evidenced by the decreased ileal SOD and T-AOC
activities and higher intestinal MDA level (P < 0.05)
(Table 5). Matrine treatment significantly decreased
jejunal and ileal MDA production (P < 0.05), suggesting
an antioxidant function in LPS-challenged mice (Table 5).

CCR7 involves in matrine-mediated
inflammation and oxidative stress in Caco-2 cells

that LPS exposure markedly inhibited cellular T-AOC
activity and enhanced MDA abundance (P < 0.05),
suggesting that LPS induced cellular oxidative stress in
Caco-2 cells. Matrine enhanced cellular T-AOC activity
(P < 0.05) but failed to alleviate MDA generation
compared with LPS treatment (P > 0.05). Meanwhile,
CCR7-siRNA transfection blocked the antioxidant
function of matrine in LPS-induced oxidative stress and
exacerbated LPS-induced oxidative stress (P < 0.05).

CCR7 was upregulated in the intestine after dietary
supplementation with matrine in mice, thus CCR7 was
further determined in vitro model after matrine and LPS
treatment. The results showed that LPS inhibited cellular
CCR7 expression, while matrine enhanced CCR7 protein
abundance (P < 0.05) (Figure 2A and 2B).
We further inhibited cellular CCR7 expression via
CCR7-siRNA transfection (Figure 2C and 2D) and found
that CCR7 inhibition blocked the anti-inflammatory
effects of matrine in LPS-challenged cells, evidenced by
the enhanced IL-1β, IL-10, IL-17, and TNF-α production
(Figure 2E–2H). In addition, CCR7-siRNA transfection
exacerbated LPS induced cellular inflammation (P < 0.05).
These results indicated that CCR7 involved in matrinemediated inflammatory response in Caco-2 cells.
Cellular SOD and T-AOC activities and MDA level
were also tested (Figure 3A–3C) and the results showed

DISCUSSION
Matrine, a kind of alkaloid component isolated from
the roots of Sophora species, has been widely demonstrated to
exhibit anti-inflammatory and antioxidant functions in various
models [1, 3, 7, 8]. In this study, we found that matrine
improved intestinal inflammatory status and antioxidant
balance. In LPS-challenged mice and Caco-2 cells, matrine
alleviated LPS-induced inflammation and oxidative stress,
which might be associated with CCR7 signal.

The present study exhibited that dietary matrine
improved intestinal inflammatory status via mediating
IL-1β and IL-17 expression. After LPS treatment, matrine
significantly alleviated LPS-induced IL-1β upregulation.
These results indicated that matrine exhibited an antiinflammatory function, which has been further confirmed
by the in vitro data. Liu et al. reported that administration of
matrine significantly increased serum production of IL-4,
IL-5, IL-10, and TGF-β1 in experimental autoimmune
encephalomyelitis [9]. In LPS-induced acute lung injury
in mice, matrine reduced the production of inflammatory
mediators, such as TNF-α, IL-6 and HMGB1, which was
possibly associated with inhibition of NF-κB [10]. NF-κB
has been considered as one of the key regulators in the
immunological and inflammatory setting [11–14] and
matrine has been suggested to involves in NF-κB signal to
regulate inflammation [15, 16].
Compelling evidences have demonstrated the
antioxidant function of matrine via enhancing antioxidant
enzymes activities and reducing free radical species
[5, 17–20]. In the diabetic cardiomyopathy in rats, the

cardiac tissues showed a marked excessive free radical
species production, while pretreatment with matrine
significantly improved oxidative balance and reduced
free radical species [21]. Meanwhile, matrine has been
also demonstrated to enhance antioxidant function against
progression of high-fructose diet-induced steatohepatitis
[17]. Similarly with previous studies, we also found that
dietary matrine improved intestinal antioxidant function
in mice and alleviated LPS induced oxidative stress in
mice and Caco-2 cells via influencing T-AOC and MDA.
MDA is a common oxidative product from lipid oxidation
[22] and the reduction of MDA in this study suggested an
antioxidant function of matrine in LPS-challenged mice
and Caco-2 cells. These results further confirmed the
antioxidant effect of marine.
Chemokine receptors have been widely investigated
in inflammatory response and oxidative stress [23–25].
In this study, we firstly investigated several chemokine
receptors after dietary matrine and the results showed
that matrine enhanced CCR2, CCR5, CCR6, and CCR7
expressions in mice, especially for CCR7. CCR7 involves

in inflammatory and immune response via regulating T-cell
homeostasis, T-cell activation and, polarization, which
play an important role in the induction and maintenance
of chronic inflammation [26–29]. Thus, we further used
CCR7-siRNA transfection to inhibit CCR7 expression in
Caco-2 cells and found that CCR7-siRNA transfection
blocked the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant functions
after LPS treatment, suggesting that CCR7 involved in
matrine mediated inflammation and oxidative stress.
CCR7-knockout mice exhibited greater inflammation and
higher release of IL-5, IL-13, TGF-β, and IL-17 compared
to wild-type mice [30, 31]. These results provide a novel
therapeutic target for inflammatory and oxidative diseases.
In conclusion, matrine improved intestinal
inflammatory and antioxidant function in mice and Caco2 cells against LPS exposure. The mechanism might be
associated with CCR7 signal, which further regulated
inflammatory response and oxidative stress.

and grown to 30–50% confluence before transfection.
The duplexes were diluted to give a final concentration
of 30 nM. The siRNA was transfected into cells using
Lipofectamine RNAiMAX reagent according to the
manufacturer’s instructions (Invitrogen).

MATERIALS AND METHODS

One piece of jejunum, ileum, and ileum were
harvested and stored at −80 ºC. Total RNA of these
tissues was isolated with TRIZOL regent (Invitrogen,
USA) and reverse transcribed into the first strand (cDNA)
using DNase I, oligo (dT) 20 and Superscript II reverse
transcriptase (Invitrogen, USA). The reverse transcription
was conducted at 37°C for 15 min, 95°C 5 sec. Primers
were designed with Primer 5.0 according to the gene
sequence of mouse to produce an amplification product
(Table 6). β-actin was chosen as the house-keeping gene
to normalize target gene levels. The PCR cycling condition
was 36 cycles at 94°C for 40 sec, 60°C for 30 sec and 72°C
for 35 sec. The relative expression was expressed as a ratio
of the target gene to the control gene using the formula 2–
(∆∆Ct)
, where ∆∆Ct = (CtTarget–Ctβ-actin)treatment–(CtTarget–Ctβ-actin)
.
Relative expression was normalized and expressed as
control
a ratio to the expression in the control group.

Measurement of oxidative stress
Intestinal and cell SOD and T-AOC activity
were measured using spectrophotometric kits (Nanjing
Jiangcheng Biotechnology Institute, China). MDA
levels were measured using a thiobarbituric acid reactive
substances assay kit according to the manufacturer’s
instructions (Nanjing Jiangcheng Biotechnology Institute,
China). IL-1β, IL-10, IL-17, and TNF-α were measured
using ELISA kits (CUSABIO, Wuhan, China).

Real-time PCR

Animal model and groups
This study was approved by the animal welfare
committee of Shandong Provincial Hospital Affiliated to
Shandong University. 40 female Balb/c mice (21.32 ± 2.17 g)
were used to investigate the effects of dietary different
matrine dosages on inflammatory status. Animals were
randomly assigned into 4 groups (n = 10) and fed with
4 different matrine diet: 0, 1, 5, and 10 mg/kg matrine for
4 weeks. Then all animals were killed and eye blood and
intestine were harvested.
To investigate the effects of matrine on LPS
induced-inflammation in mice, 30 female Balb/c mice
(20.13 ± 1.65 g) were randomly assigned to daily
subcutaneous injections of LPS (25 μg) [32], PBS as a
control, and LPS plus dietary 10 mg/kg matrine. After
4 weeks, animals were killed for sample collection.

Western bolt for CCR7 expression
One piece of jejunum, ileum, and ileum were
harvested and stored at –80°C. Proteins were extracted
with using protein extraction reagents (Thermo Fisher
Scientific Inc., USA) and the concentration was tested
using BCA protein assay (Sigma-Aldrich, USA). Proteins
(30 µg) were separated by SDS–polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis and electrophoretically transferred to a
polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane (BioRad,
Hercules, CA, USA). Membranes were blocked and then
incubated with the following primary antibodies: AntiCCR7 antibody [Y59] (ab32527) (Abcam). Mouse β–actin
antibody (Sigma) was used for protein loading control.
After primary antibody incubation, membranes were
washed, incubated with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated
anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG antibodies (Promega,
Madison, WI, USA), and quantified and digitally analyzed
using the image J program (NIH).

Cell culture
Human epithelial Caco-2 cells were grown in
Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (DMEM)/F12
supplemented with 10% FBS (HyClone, Logan, UT)
and 50 U/mL penicillin–streptomycin and maintained at
37°C in a humidified chamber of 5% CO2. Confluent cells
(85–90%) were incubated with different concentrations
of matrine (0, 0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 0.5, 1, 2, and 5 mM) and
LPS (0, 10, 50, 100, and 200 μM) for 4 days to establish
inflammatory model [33].

CCR7-siRNA transfection
Human CCR7-siRNA was obtained from
Guangzhou RiboBio and the sequences were accorded to
a previous report [34]. Cells were cultured in 6-well plates
