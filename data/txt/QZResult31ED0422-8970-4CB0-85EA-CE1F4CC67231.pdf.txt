The taxanes are effective microtubule-stabilizing chemotherapy drugs used in the treatment of
various solid tumors. However, the emergence of drug resistance hampers their clinical efficacy.
The molecular basis of clinical taxane resistance remains poorly understood. Breast cancer 1, early
onset gene, BRCA1, is a tumor-suppressor gene, whose expression has been correlated with
taxane sensitivity in many solid tumors including non-small cell lung cancer. However, the
molecular mechanism underlying the relationship between BRCA1 (B1) expression and taxane
activity remains unclear. To this end, we created a stable B1 knockdown A549 cell line (B1-KD)
to investigate B1’s role in microtubule biology and response to taxane treatment. We show that
B1-KD rendered A549 cells resistant to paclitaxel (PTX), phenocopying clinical studies showing
that low B1 expression correlated with taxane resistance. As previously reported, we show that
loss of B1 enhanced centrosomal γ-tubulin localization and microtubule nucleation. Interestingly,
we found that the B1-KD cells exhibited increased microtubule dynamics as compared with
parental A549 cells, as assessed by live-cell confocal microscopy using enhanced green
fluorescent protein-tagged α-tubulin or EB1 protein. In addition, we showed that loss of B1
impairs the ability of PTX to induce microtubule polymerization using immunofluorescence
microscopy and a cell-based tubulin polymerization assay. Furthermore, B1-KD cells exhibited
significantly lower intracellular binding of a fluorescently labeled PTX to microtubules. Recent
studies have shown that PTX-stabilized microtubules serves as a scaffold for pro-caspase-8
binding and induction of apoptosis downstream of induced-proximity activation of caspase-8.
Here we show that loss of B1 reduces the association of pro-caspase-8 with microtubules and
subsequently leads to impaired PTX-induced activation of apoptosis. Taken together, our data
show that B1 regulates indirectly endogenous microtubule dynamics and stability while its loss
leads to microtubules that are more dynamic and less susceptible to PTX-induced stabilization
conferring taxane resistance.

INTRODUCTION
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The microtubule is arguably one of the most important targets for cancer chemotherapy
owing to the clinical success of microtubule-targeting drugs such as the taxanes and vinca
alkaloids.1 In solid tumors, the taxanes are among the most effective chemotherapeutic
agents routinely used in the treatment of a wide range of tumors including breast cancer,2–7
non-small cell lung cancer8,9 and prostate cancer.10–13 Despite the efficacy of the taxanes,
many tumors display either inherent or acquired resistance to them, hampering their clinical
activity. The molecular basis underpinning the taxanes’ clinical resistance has not been fully
elucidated.
Interestingly, in clinical studies, loss of function and/or low expression of the breast cancer
1, early onset gene (BRCA1) have been associated with resistance to taxane and sensitivity
to DNA-damaging-based chemotherapies (for example, cisplatin, anthracycline) in a variety
of tumor types.14–18 BRCA1 is a tumor-suppressor gene with well-defined nuclear functions
that include DNA damage response and repair, as well as cell cycle checkpoint activation.19
The central role of BRCA1 in DNA repair can readily explain why its loss leads to enhanced
cisplatin sensitivity.20 However, the molecular basis of taxane resistance conferred by loss
of BRCA1, or the taxane sensitization observed on restoration of wild-type BRCA121 is not
well understood.

Recently, cytoplasmic functions of BRCA1 have been identified including focal adhesion
and centrosome regulation.22,23 BRCA1 was shown to inhibit centrosomal microtubule
nucleation in a cell cycle-dependent manner by ubiquitinating gamma(γ)-tubulin and
preventing its centrosomal localization.24,25 Beyond these data, little is known about any
part BRCA1 has in the regulation of microtubule biology and, especially, the microtubule
response to taxane treatment.

Taxanes bind beta (β)-tubulin and stabilize microtubules leading to mitotic arrest and cell
death. Therefore, the taxanes have been classically thought to exert their antitumor activity
by inhibiting mitosis. However, recent evidence suggests that microtubule-stabilizing drugs
have alternative mechanisms of action that lead to cell death, primarily through signaling
pathways occurring during interphase.26,27 One such pathway is the activation of caspase-8
following taxane-induced microtubule stabilization. Mielgo et al.28 showed that paclitaxel
(PTX)-stabilized microtubules served as a scaffold for the binding of the death-effector
domain of pro-caspase-8. Thus, the microtubule polymers provided a platform for sufficient
spatial proximity of pro-caspase-8 molecules, enabling activation of the downstream
caspase-8 proteolytic cascade, via induced-proximity activation, which is the main
mechanism of caspase-8 activation. Although this report provided a mechanistic explanation
for interphase-induced cell death following PTX treatment, the potential role BRCA1 has in
modulating this pathway affecting taxane sensitivity and resistance remains to be elucidated.
To better understand the mechanism of BRCA1-mediated taxane resistance, we set out to
investigate the effects of BRCA1 on microtubule biology and its potential relationship with
taxane activity. To this end, we have generated an isogenic pair of cell lines with and
without BRCA1 protein expression. We have found that BRCA1 knockdown (B1-KD) in
A549 lung cancer cells confers resistance to PTX and sensitivity to cisplatin treatment,
recapitulating the reported clinical phenotypes. We show that BRCA1 regulates microtubule
dynamics and stability and that by modulating the microtubule cytoskeletal network,
BRCA1 controls how microtubules respond to PTX treatment and, consequently, alter druginduced microtubule-based activation of caspase-8.

Loss of BRCA1 in A549 cells mimics clinical taxane resistance

To better understand the role of BRCA1 in taxane sensitivity and resistance, we have
generated an isogenic pair of A549 non-small cell lung cancer cell lines consisting of the
parental cell line with functional wild-type BRCA1 and a derivative cell line with stable
BRCA1 knockdown (B1-KD) following lentiviral infection with empty and BRCA1-specific
short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) and subsequent selection of stable clones using puromycin
(Figure 1). Several clones were isolated and expanded for the empty and BRCA1-specific
shRNAs. The BRCA1-specific shRNA clone with the highest BRCA1 knockdown by
reverse transcriptase–PCR and western blot analyses, namely B1-KD, was selected for
further characterization, and the empty shRNA clone, henceforth named A549, with no
change in BRCA1 mRNA and protein levels was used as the control (Supplementary Figure
S1a). Initial characterization of B1-KD cells revealed a 70% decrease in BRCA1 mRNA
expression as assessed by quantitative PCR and a concomitant decrease in BRCA1 protein
expression (Figures 1a and b). To ensure that the loss of BRCA1 protein was associated with
loss of function, we assessed the extent of γ-tubulin ubiquitination and localization as well
as centrosome amplification, as they represent hallmarks of BRCA1 cytoplasmic
function.24,25 Recent reports identified that the BRCA1/BARD1 complex serves as the E3ubiquitin ligase for γ-tubulin and that ubiquitination of γ-tubulin results in the displacement
of the latter from the centrosome. Thus, BRCA1 loss of function is associated with
centrosome amplification via accumulation of γ-tubulin at the centrosome. Indeed, our
results revealed significantly higher amounts of γ-tubulin localized at the centrosome in B1KD cells, as compared with the A549 cells (Figure 1c). In agreement with the established
role of BRCA1 in γ-tubulin ubiquitination, our results showed that immunoprecipitation of
γ-tubulin from B1-KD cells was associated with a loss of γ-tubulin mono-ubiquitination in
contrast to the results obtained using the A549 cell line (Supplementary Figure S1b, arrow
points to mono-ubiquitinated form of γ-tubulin). In addition, immunofluorescence staining
with pericentrin (used as a marker of the centrosome) revealed that B1-KD cells had an
increased number of cells with amplified centrosomes (that is, >2 centrosomes per cell), as
compared with the A549 cells (P<0.01), in agreement with published reports (Figure 1d).
Next, to determine whether the loss of BRCA1 had an impact on the cells’ sensitivity to
PTX and cisplatin, we performed a 30-h cytotoxicity assay, which revealed that B1-KD cells
were threefold more resistant to PTX (PTX IC50 = 30 and 10 nM for B1-KD and A549,
respectively) and fourfold more sensitive to cisplatin (CDDP IC50 = 0.5 μM and 2 μM for
B1-KD and A549, respectively, as compared with the A549 cells; Figure 1e). The doubling
times for the A549 and B1-KD cells were 25 and 31 h, respectively. A second B1-KD clone
with similar BRCA1 protein knockdown also showed PTX resistance in the 30-h
cytotoxicity assay (Supplementary Figure S2). To confirm BRCA1 knockdown renders cells
PTX-resistant was not limited to A549 cells, transient B1-KD with BRCA1-specific shRNA
in HOP62 cells rendered them PTX-resistant compared with empty controls, although to a
lesser extent than in the A549 model (Supplementary Figure S3) because of the <30%
transfection efficiency observed. Similar results were obtained in a 72-h cytotoxicity assay
using sulforhodamine B (data not shown). In a soft agar colony formation assay, the B1-KD
cells grew into well-formed, larger size colonies in the presence of PTX while the A549
cells did not (Supplementary Figure S4). Taken together, these data suggest that the B1-KD
cells we have generated exhibited loss of function of BRCA1 and phenocopy clinical taxane
resistance and platinum sensitivity.
BRCA1 modulates microtubule dynamics
As the microtubule is the cellular target of PTX, we hypothesized that loss of BRCA1
protein renders cells more PTX-resistant because of alterations of the microtubule

cytoskeleton. The role of BRCA1 on centrosome function24,25 prompted us to investigate
centrosomal microtubule nucleation in A549 and B1-KD cells. In each cell line,
microtubules were completely depolymerized using nocodazole, and allowed to regrow after
nocodazole was washed out from the cells. Our results revealed that the B1-KD cells
displayed an increased microtubule regrowth from the centrosome following nocodazole
washout as compared with the A549 cells. Quantitative analysis of the average length of
individual microtubules revealed a significant increase in centrosomal microtubule regrowth
in the B1-KD cells compared with A549 cells (Figure 2a, P <0.0001). Similar results were
seen in another B1-KD clone as well in the HOP62 cell line (Supplementary Figure S5). The
steady-state length of individual microtubules is determined by their intrinsic dynamic
instability reflected by the balance between the rates of tubulin dimer addition and removal
from microtubule plus-ends.1,29 To examine the behavior of microtubule plus-end dynamics
as a function of BRCA1 expression we assessed the velocity of the microtubule plus-endassociated protein EB1 in A549 and B1-KD cells, using live-cell confocal microscopy. EB1
tracking is utilized as a marker of microtubule dynamics and it binds to the plus-end of
growing microtubules while it dissociates from microtubules during phases of pause or
shortening.30 Therefore, EB1 tracking is considered a highly sensitive and reliable surrogate
marker of microtubule dynamics. We transfected A549 and B1-KD cells with a plasmid
encoding enhanced green fluorescent protein-tagged EB1 and assessed microtubule growth
dynamics using live-cell spinning disk confocal microscopy. Our data involving analyses of
approximately 30 representative cells per condition revealed that the EB1 comet velocity
was significantly increased in B1-KD cells at a rate of 20 μm/min as compared with 10 μm/
min observed in the A549 line (Figure 2b). Although these results indicated enhanced
microtubule growth rates in B1-KD cells, the other properties of microtubule dynamics such
as shortening rates or time spent at pause could not be determined because EB1 only
associates with the growing microtubule.31 To assess if BRCA1 regulated other parameters
of microtubule dynamicity, we monitored microtubule dynamics in both cell lines, by
tracking the tips of enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-labeled microtubules using
live-cell confocal microscopy. Our results showed that loss of BRCA1 led to an increase in
both the rates of microtubule polymerization (14 vs 18 μm/min), corroborating the EB1
comet velocity data, as well as depolymerization (15 vs 22 μm/min) in A549 and B1-KD
cells, respectively. In addition, microtubules from the B1-KD cells spent less total time at
pause (24 vs 46% for B1-KD and A549 cells, respectively) and displayed enhanced overall
microtubule dynamicity (16 μm/min) as compared with microtubules from A549 cells (9
μm/min; Figure 2c and Table 1). Taken together, these data suggest that BRCA1 has a role
in microtubule biology by dampening centrosomal microtubule nucleation and overall
microtubule dynamics.

Loss of BRCA1 impairs PTX-induced microtubule stabilization
To examine whether the effects of B1-KD on microtubule dynamics affected the ability of
PTX to engage its target and induce microtubule stabilization, we examined the extent of
drug-induced microtubule stabilization in A549 and B1-KD cells. We used microtubule
bundling (Figure 3a, arrows) as the readout for cellular taxane activity in an
immunofluorescence assay, as microtubule bundle formation is the result of drug-mediated
microtubule polymer stabilization and as such it represents a hallmark of taxane cellular
activity. Using this assay, we observed that the ability of PTX to induce microtubule
bundling in the B1-KD cells was markedly compromised as compared with the abundant
microtubule bundles present in PTX-treated A549 cells (Figure 3a and Supplementary
Figure S6). To quantitate the effect of PTX treatment on microtubule polymer mass, we
performed a cell-based tubulin polymerization assay, in which cells were exposed to PTX
and microtubule polymers (P) were separated from soluble tubulin dimers (S) by
centrifugation. As shown in Figure 3b, PTX treatment of A549 cells resulted in a shift of

total tubulin recovered in the polymer fraction, from 10% in control to 60% following PTX
treatment. In contrast, PTX treatment of B1-KD cells resulted in a modest increase in
microtubule polymer mass, from 8% in untreated cells to 36% in drug-treated cells. Taken
together, these results indicate that loss of BRCA1 renders microtubules more dynamic and
less responsive to PTX treatment suggesting that the drug–tubulin interaction might be
compromised under these conditions.
To further investigate why loss of BRCA1 makes microtubules less responsive to PTX
treatment, we examined the extent of PTX cellular binding affinity to microtubules in A549
or B1-KD cells. To do so, we treated cells with a fluorescently tagged PTX for 16 h, and
measured the average fluorescence intensity in the cell’s cytoplasm in both cell lines. We
observed that B1-KD cells had a ~50% decrease in average fluorescence intensity compared
with the A549 cells when normalized for cell area (Figure 3c). These data corroborate and
extend our earlier observations and demonstrate that loss of BRCA1 diminishes the binding
of PTX to cellular microtubules resulting in impaired drug-induced microtubule
stabilization.

Microtubules serve as binding sites for many microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs),
which regulate endogenous microtubule dynamics and control changes in microtubule
behavior in response to stress. Our results indicate that BRCA1 directly or indirectly affects
microtubule biology and response to microtubule-stabilizing agents. Accordingly, BRCA1
may be a MAP that promotes microtubule stability, similar to the von Hippel-Lindau tumor
suppressor protein,32 and whose loss could render microtubules hypostable. To test the
hypothesis that BRCA1 is a MAP, we performed a microtubule co-sedimentation assay,
which is a more sensitive and robust alternative to co-immunoprecipitations, for the
identification of cellular proteins that have affinity for the microtubule polymer. This assay
utilizes successive cycles of tubulin polymerization and depolymerization based on the
physical and chemical properties of tubulin, whereas the addition of exogenous purified
tubulin provides a ‘microtubule polymer core seed’ for MAP binding. Here, briefly precleared total cell lysate (high-speed supernatant) from A549 cells was supplemented with
exogenous purified microtubule protein and subjected to a cycle of polymerization in the
presence of PTX and guanosine-5′-triphosphate (GTP) at 37 °C. Microtubule polymers and
any endogenous proteins with affinity for them were sedimented in the pellet fraction (warm
pellet (WP)) following high-speed centrifugation, whereas soluble tubulin dimers and all
other cellular proteins remained in the supernatant (warm supernatant). To ensure that the
resulting WP fraction contained functional microtubules as opposed to nonspecific protein
aggregate, we subjected microtubule polymers from the WP fraction to a cycle of cold-,
calcium-induced depolymerization followed by high-speed centrifugation in order to
separate the soluble tubulin (cold supernatant) from any remaining cold-stable microtubules
(cold pellet). Surprisingly, our results showed that no BRCA1 was recovered in the WP
fraction under conditions that resulted in near 100% tubulin polymerization and as such no
BRCA1 was recovered in the cold supernatant and cold pellet fraction, which are derivatives
of WP. Instead, all of BRCA1 protein was recovered in the supernatant fraction (warm
supernatant) suggesting that BRCA1 is not directly associated with microtubules but that it
exerts its effects on microtubules indirectly (Figure 3d).
Loss of BRCA1 reduces PTX-induced caspase-8 activation
Caspase-8 activation has been recently implicated in the mechanism of PTX-induced
apoptosis, via the association of the death-effector domain of pro-caspase-8 with stable
microtubules.28 This report together with our results showing that BRCA1 loss impairs
PTX-induced microtubule stabilization and sensitivity to drug treatment prompted us to
examine the involvement of the caspase-8 death-effector domain in the mechanism of
BRCA1-mediated PTX resistance. Immunostaining of A549 and B1-KD cells with the

death-effector domain of caspase-8 revealed that caspase-8 colocalized with PTX-induced
microtubule bundles in the A549 cells, but not in the B1-KD cells (Figure 4A). As caspase-8
accumulation on PTX-stabilized microtubules has been reported to lead to zymogen
cleavage and activation of caspase-8, we next investigated the ability of PTX to induce
caspase-8 activation in the B1-KD line. PTX treatment of A549 cells resulted in caspase-8
activation as indicated by the presence of the active cleaved form of caspase-8 (Figure 4B).
In contrast, no activation of caspase-8 was observed in B1-KD cells following PTX
treatment. To confirm that caspase-8 activation is responsible for PTX-induced cell death,
we pre-treated cells with a caspase-8 inhibitor before PTX treatment and assessed the ability
of the drug to induce cell death by performing flow cytometry analysis for markers of cell
death, namely annexin-V and propidium iodide. Our results showed that caspase-8 inhibitor
decreased PTX-induced cell death (Figure 4C, P <0.01, and Supplementary Figure S7).
Taken together, these data suggest that caspase-8 cleavage, and subsequent cell death, is
activated on short-term PTX treatment in the A549 cell line and that loss of BRCA1
prevents this activation possibly due to the loss of PTX-stabilized microtubule, which serves
as a platform for caspase-8 accumulation and induced-proximity activation.

DISCUSSION
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

PTX is the prototype of microtubule-stabilizing drugs and, since the discovery of its unique
mechanism of action, researchers worldwide have been focusing on the discovery of small
molecules with a similar mechanism of action. Ever since the introduction of PTX in clinical
oncology, an equally intensive research effort has been undertaken to understand the
molecular basis of clinical activity and resistance. To date, despite the publication of >20
000 research reports on PTX, the mechanisms underlying clinical taxane resistance remain
poorly understood. Acquired drug resistance is the number one cause of cancer-related
deaths in metastatic patients. Therefore, a better understanding of the pathways responsible
for drug resistance is imperative, in order to design improved therapeutic strategies.

BRCA1 has recently emerged as a clinical biomarker predictive of taxane activity. Several
studies have reported that low BRCA1 expression levels and/or BRCA1 loss of function is
associated with a lower patient response to taxane-based chemotherapy. BRCA1 is a tumorsuppressor protein mutated in 5–10% of breast and ovarian cancer patients, whereas low
expression levels of BRCA1 have been reported in over 20–30% of patients with a variety of
solid tumors.19,33–40 The BRCA1 protein is involved in several cellular pathways including
DNA repair, checkpoint activation and protein ubiquitination.19 Interestingly, low BRCA1
levels or mutation-driven loss of function have been correlated with chemosensitivity to
platinum and chemoresistance to taxane chemotherapy in numerous clinical and preclinical
studies.14–17 As platinum and taxane chemotherapies are often used in combination for the
treatment of different solid tumors and in particular lung cancer, current prospective clinical
trials are utilizing BRCA1 expression to assign patients to platinum or taxane chemotherapy
in an effort to personalize chemotherapy and enhance clinical response (ClinicalTrials.gov
ID#’s NCT01424709, NCT00478699, NCT01276769). The sensitization of tumors with
BRCA1 loss of function to platinum agents has been attributed primarily to the central role
of BRCA1 in DNA repair pathways such as homologous recombination and nonhomologous end-joining.20 DNA-damaging drugs such as cisplatin are known to work by
cross-linking DNA strands, therefore, their activity is enhanced when DNA repair is
compromised. In contrast, little data exist to explain the relationship behind the resistance of
tumors with BRCA1 loss of function to taxanes, partly due to the lack of understanding of
the role that BRCA1 has in microtubule biology. Here, we provide evidence that will help
shed some light on the role of BRCA1 in taxane resistance. We show that BRCA1
modulates microtubules such that loss of BRCA1 leads to increased microtubule
dynamicity. We demonstrate that the increase in microtubule dynamicity renders

microtubules less sensitive to PTX-induced stabilization and in turn prevents the stabilized
microtubule-based activation of caspase-8 and subsequent activation of cell death (Figure 5).

A major question arising from our data is how BRCA1 regulates microtubule biology.
Proteins that regulate microtubules in cells are the so-called MAPs that bind microtubules
directly in order to promote microtubule stabilization (for example, MAP4)41 or
destabilization (for example, stathmin).42 In addition to these classically defined MAPs,
along with others, we have identified numerous other proteins that associate with the
microtubule cytoskeleton for the purposes of intracellular trafficking (for example, p53, AR,
HIF),43–46 protein–protein interactions (for example, von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor
protein)32,47 and signaling (for example, GSK3β, APC).48,49 Therefore, the first question
that we asked was whether BRCA1 associates with microtubules in order to suppress
microtubule dynamics. However, our results argue against BRCA1 being a MAP as we
clearly show that BRCA1 does not co-sediment with microtubule polymers (Figure 3d)
suggesting that BRCA1 does not bind tubulin directly. These results have been corroborated
by lack of colocalization between the two proteins as assessed by BRCA1 and tubulin
immunofluorescence staining as well as lack of co-immunoprecipitation using antibodies
specific for each respective protein (data not shown). However, complete lack of interaction
between the two proteins in the cell’s cytoplasm cannot be entirely ruled out as our assays
might not have detected a transient or weak interaction between the two proteins. Taken
together, these data suggest that BRCA1 is indirectly modulating cellular microtubule
dynamics. Although BRCA1 has been shown to associate with some MAPs (for example,
Nlp, TPX2, NuMA, XRHAMM),50,51 these are mitotic spindle proteins, which do not have
a regulatory role in the modulation of interphase microtubule dynamics. BRCA1 is
associated with several protein complexes that perform multi-functional processes in the
cell, primarily in the nucleus. For BRCA1 to modulate microtubule stability, we reasoned
that a cytoplasmic pathway functionally links the two proteins. An intriguing possibility for
such a cytoplasmic pathway is that of the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of BRCA1. BRCA1 in
association with BARD1 forms a functional E3 ubiquitin ligase and this complex has
recently been identified to regulate breast cancer cell spreading and motility by interacting
with focal adhesion proteins.22 Interestingly, one of the targets of the BRCA1/BARD1 E3
ubiquitin ligase is γ-tubulin,52 whose ubiquitination impairs γ-tubulin’s centrosomal
localization and ability to nucleate microtubules.24,25 Indeed, we show here that B1-KD
cells have impaired γ-tubulin ubiquitination (Supplementary Figure S1b), and consequently
enhanced γ-tubulin centrosomal localization (Figure 1c) and microtubule nucleation (Figure
2a). Interestingly, a recent report showed that a decrease in neuronal γ-tubulin levels
dampened microtubule dynamics, functionally implicating the centrosomal nucleation that
occurs at the minus-end of microtubules with regulation of their plus-ends dynamicity.53 In
support of a role of γ-tubulin in the modulation of microtubule dynamics, another report
showed that in Drosophilia S2 cells, γ-tubulin localizes to interphase microtubules lattice
regulating dynamics by limiting microtubule catastrophe frequencies.54 Our data also
support of role for γ-tubulin in the modulation of endogenous microtubule dynamics
whereby loss of BRCA1 impairs γ-tubulin ubiquitination leading to enhanced γ-tubulin
centrosomal localization, which in turn results in increased microtubule dynamicity.
Another possibility as to how the BRCA1/BARD1 complex may regulate microtubule
dynamics is by controlling the ubiquitination status of the tubulin α/β heterodimer. Recent
data have revealed that α-tubulin exists in a ubiquitinated state, however, the E3 ubiquitin
ligase responsible for this α-tubulin modification or the functional significance of tubulin
ubiquitination, remain unknown.55 Intriguingly, our preliminary results using α-tubulin
immunoprecipitation from A549 and B1-KD whole-cell lysates show a strikingly decreased
amount of ubiquitinated α-tubulin from the B1-KD cells compared with the A549 cells
(highlighted boxes, Supplementary Figure S8a). Although we showed that BRCA1 is not a

MAP (Figure 3d), it stands to reason that, because of the high homology between γ-tubulin
and α/β tubulin, the α/β heterodimer may also be a substrate for the BRCA1/BARD1 E3
ubiquitin ligase complex. Transfection of 293 cells with a ubiquitinligase defective mutant
BRCA1 B1 (I26A) plasmid showed a trend toward increased PTX resistance, however,
additional experiments are required in order to draw a firm conclusion (Supplementary
Figure S8b). Our preliminary data in Supplementary Figure S8a support the notion that
BRCA1 controls the ubiquitination status of the tubulin α/β heterodimer, whether directly or
indirectly. Future work in our laboratory will focus on the role of α/β tubulin ubiquitination
in relation to regulation of microtubule dynamics and downstream microtubule signaling
pathways.

Importantly, we show here that loss of BRCA1 cells confers taxane resistance, likely due to
the fact that dynamic microtubules are a relatively poor substrate for PTX binding (Figure
3c). In agreement with our data, earlier reports have shown that enhanced microtubule
dynamics are associated with taxane resistance in A549 cells, following in vitro selection for
PTX resistance.56 Similarly, earlier studies have demonstrated that the homeostasis of
microtubule dynamics and the equilibrium between microtubule polymers and the pool of
soluble tubulin dimers, changes following selection with a microtubule-stabilizing or destabilizing drug, resulting in cells with hypo-or hyper-stable microtubules, respectively.57
Together these studies provide further evidence for the notion that highly dynamic
microtubules serve as a poor substrate for taxane binding and are in agreement with our
results showing lower TubulinTracker labeling of the microtubule cytoskeleton in B1-KD
cells (Figure 3c). Interestingly, our results also show that loss of BRCA1 renders
microtubules hypostable, more sensitive to the effects of the microtubule-depolymerizing
drug nocodazole (Supplementary Figure S9) and more resistant to the microtubulestabilizing drug PTX (Figures 3a and b).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Although changes in microtubule homeostasis are established cellular responses to drug
selection with microtubule inhibitors, here we show that a biological perturbation, namely
loss of BRCA1, rather than drug-selection pressure, increases microtubule dynamicity
resulting in taxane resistance. We have recently shown that knockdown of protein
farnesyltransferase, which unlike BRCA1 binds microtubules, also resulted in enhanced
microtubule dynamicity and taxane resistance.58,59 Clinically, we have also found a
correlation between lower expression of farnesyltransferase and lack of clinical response to
taxane-based chemotherapy,60 similar to the existing clinical studies with BRCA1.
Although, the exact pathway that links BRCA1 with microtubule dynamics remains to be
fully elucidated, we provide here an explanation that links loss of BRCA1 with taxane
insensitivity via the lack of microtubule-dependent activation of caspase-8 by the inducedproximity model (Figure 5).
Taken together, these data continue to define the microtubule as a platform for signal
transduction. Long has it been appreciated the microtubule’s roles in basic cell biology
including the motor transport of vesicles and organelles and mitosis. A role for microtubule
biology as being central to signal transduction pathways is emerging.45,59,61 Here, we show
that PTX-induced cell death signaling through caspase-8 is directly controlled by how
microtubules respond to the drug, and that the behavior of these microtubules is regulated by
BRCA1.
Identifying the precise mechanism by which low BRCA1 levels lead to taxane resistance
could allow the development of therapeutic agents that could re-sensitize tumors with low
BRCA1 expression levels to taxane agents, or potentially identify a combination therapy that
would be synergistic for taxane response in both taxane-sensitive and taxane-resistant
patients.

Cell culture and transfections
A549 cells were cultured in RPMI supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1%
pencillin/streptomycin. BRCA1-specific shRNAs were obtained from Open Biosystems
(Huntsville, AL, USA). Lentiviral particles were generated and harvested from HEK293T
cells using standard protocols. A549 cells were infected with BRCA1-specific lentiviral
shRNA particles for 24 h, and colonies were selected with 2 μg/ml puromycin. The EB1EGFP and EGFP-tubulin constructs were transfected using the Fugene 6 reagent according
to the manufacturer’s protocol.
Real-time PCR
mRNA was isolated from the A549 and B1-KD cells using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen,
Hilden, Germany). In all, 1 μg of RNA was used to generate complementary DNA using the
Protoscript First Stand cDNA Synthesis Kit (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA). A
1:10 dilution of the complementary DNA was used as template in an iQ SYBR Green
Supermix (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) reaction with BRCA1-specific primers.
BRCA1 forward primer = 5′-AGCCAGCCACAGGTACAGAG-3′

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

BRCA1 reverse primer = 5′-AGTAGCCAGGACAGTAGAAGGAC-3′
A relative quantification of BRCA1 mRNA levels, using β-actin as the internal control, was
calculated using a comparative Ct method.
Western blot
Following drug treatments, cells are collected and lysed in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris pH 7.5,
100 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 1% NP-40) supplemented with 7 × Protease Inhibitor cocktail
(Roche Diagnostics). Following separation via gel electrophoresis, proteins were transferred
onto polyvinylidene difluoride and blocked in 5% milk, 1% Tween-20 and 0.1% fetal bovine
serum. Target proteins were detected using secondary antibodies compatible with the
Odyssey Imaging System from LICOR Biosciences (Lincoln, NE, USA). Densitometric
analysis was performed where appropriate with ImageJ (National Institutes of Health,
Bethesda, MD, USA).

Immunofluorescence

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Cells were plated on #1.5 coverslips (Electron Microscopy Services, Hatfield, PA, USA).
Following drug treatment, cells were pre-extracted with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 30 s and
fixed with PHEMO buffer as described previously.62 Cells were stained with primary
antibodies at room temperature for 1 h and secondary antibodies at room temperature for 30
min. Coverslips were then mounted onto slides with MOWIOL. Images were acquired with
a Zeiss LSM 700 (Carl Zeiss Inc., Thornwood, NY, USA).
Cytotoxicity assay
Cells were plated in 96-well plates and treated with drugs for 30 h. Cell viability was
measured using the CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay from Promega
(Madison, WI, USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Percentage survival was
calculated as the treatment divided by control for each concentration of drug.
Microtubule regrowth assay

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Cells on coverslips are treated with 10 μM nocodazole at 4 °C for 1 h to completely
depolymerize microtubules. Nocodazole was washed out, replaced with warmed media
followed with incubation at 37 °C for 10 min. Cells then fixed, stained and imaged as
described above. Microtubule length was measured as the length of a single microtubule
originating from the centrosome to the most distal tip (MetaMorph Software, Universal
Imaging, Downingtown, PA, USA).
Live-cell imaging with EB1-EGFP
EB1-EGFP transfected A549 and B1-KD cells were imaged with Hamamatsu Orca R2
camera (Middlesex, NJ, USA) mounted onto a CSU-X1 (Yokogawa Electric Corporation,
Inc., Tokyo, Japan) spinning disk head on a Zeiss SD Observer I equipped with a 100 ×
Plan-Apochromat (NA = 1.46) oil objective (Carl Zeiss Inc.). Time lapses were recorded
and measured with Metamorph. EB-1 comet velocity was measured as the distance each
EB1 puncta traveled over time lapse divided by the total time of the time lapse. Only those
puncta tracks with a discernible beginning and end were measured.
Microtubule dynamics assay

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

EGFP-α-tubulin transfected A549 and B1-KD cells were imaged with the same microscope
setup mentioned above and imaging experimental conditions were recorded as previously
described.63 Briefly, the tips of growing and shrinking microtubules were tracked in time
lapse movies recorded every 5 s for a total of 5 min. Polymerization and depolymerization
mean rates were calculated as total distance of growth or shrinkage, respectively, over time.
A catastrophe is defined as a transition into microtubule shortening whereas a rescue is a
transition from shortening to growth or pause. To calculate catastrophe frequency per unit
time, the number of catastrophes was divided by the total time in growth. Conversely, the
rescue frequency was calculated by dividing the number of rescues by the total time spent.
Microtubule dynamicity is defined as the total length grown and shortened during the life
(measured in minutes) of an individual microtubule.
TubulinTracker assay
For TubulinTracker experiments, A549 and B1-KD cells were treated with 250 nM
TubulinTracker Green for 16 h at 37 °C. Following this incubation, the TubulinTracker was
washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and replaced with phenol-red-free RPMI.
Images were acquired with the same spinning disk microscope with a 40 × Plan-Neofluar
(NA = 0.75) objective (Carl Zeiss Inc.). To determine the area of the cell, an image with
transmitted light was acquired. The average fluorescence intensity of the TubulinTracker

was measured following a statistical background correction (MetaMorph) by using the
transmitted light image to define the area of the cells. The fluorescence intensity of the
TubulinTracker was normalized by the total area of the cell. For each condition ~150 cells
were measured.
Tubulin polymerization assay
Following drug treatment, cells were washed warm phosphate-buffered saline once. Cell
were scraped and lysed in low salt buffer (20 mM Tris–HCl pH 6.8, 1 mM MgCl2, 2 mM
EGTA, 0.5% NP-40, 1X protease inhibitor cocktail). Samples spun at max speed in a
tabletop centrifuge for 30 min at room temperature. The supernatant (S) was separated from
the pellet (P). The pellet was resuspended in 1 × Laemmli buffer and sonicated. Equal
volumes of supernatant and pellet samples were loaded onto a gel for western blot. % Pellet
is calculated as the densitometric value of the pellet band divided by the total densitometric
value of the pellet and supernatant bands. Three biological repeats were performed for this
assay.
Microtubule co-sedimentation assay

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

A549 cell lysates were subjected to the microtubule co-sedimentation assay as previously
described.45 Briefly, A549 cells were scraped in PIPES-EGTA-MgCl2 buffer (80 mM
PIPES, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM MgCl2 pH 6.8) supplemented with 1X cocktail protease
inhibitors. Scraped cells were spun at ~16 000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C and the high-speed
pellet and high-speed supernatant were separated. Exogenous purified bovine tubulin
(suspended in warm PIPES-EGTA-MgCl2 buffer and 0.5 mM guanosine-5′-triphosphate
(GTP)) was added to cell lysates (high-speed supernatant) and one cycle of microtubule
polymerization was carried out at 37 °C with 20 μM PTX for 30 min. Microtubules were
pelleted (WP) at ~100 000 × g for 35 min at room temperature and separated from the
supernatant (warm supernatant). Microtubules in the WP were depolymerized by sonication
and incubation with 12 mM CaCl2 on ice for 30 min. Properly depolymerized microtubules
(cold supernatant) were separated from aggregated tubulin protein and polymerized debris
(cold pellet) by a cold (4 °C) centrifugation at ~30 000 × g for 15 min.
Flow cytometry

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

A549 cells were pre-treated with vehicle or 30 μM caspase-8 inhibitor (C8i) for 2 h in
serum-supplemented media followed by addition of vehicle or 10 nM PTX for 36 h. Cells
were collected, stained with annexin-V and propidium iodide for 15 min at room
temperature and flowed through the LSR II system (BD Biosciences) to determine cell
viability. Results were analyzed with the flow cytometry analysis software FlowJo
(TreeStar, Ashland, OR, USA).
Statistics
Graphpad Prism 4 (Graphpad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA) was used to calculate
Student’s t-test and analysis of variance test (where appropriate) to determine if the mean of
the measurements were significantly different between the A549 and B1-KD cell lines. Pvalues are demonstrated as * = <0.05, ** = <0.01, *** = <0.001 and **** = <0.0001. All
error bars shown in the plots are the standard error of the mean.

Characterization of B1-KD in A549 cells. (a) Relative BRCA1 mRNA expression levels in
A549 and B1-KD cells determined by real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR; P<0.01). Total
RNA was extracted from A549 and B1-KD cells and subjected to real-time qPCR using
primers specific for BRCA1 or actin. (a) relative quantification of BRCA1 and actin mRNA
levels was calculated using a comparative Ct method. BRCA1 data were normalized to
actin. Results are displayed as percentage of control (A549 cells). (b) Immunoblot of
BRCA1 protein expression in A549 and B1-KD cells. Actin is used as a loading control. In
all, 50 μg of total cell lysates from A549 and B1-KD cells were resolved by sodium dodecyl
sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS–PAGE) and immunostained using an
antibody against BRCA1 (C-20) and actin as a loading control. (c) Localization of γ-tubulin
in A549 and B1-KD cells was assessed by γ-tubulin immunofluorescence. One
representative cell is shown per condition, centrosomes are labeled by γ-tubulin staining.
Scale bar = 1 μm. Bar graph shows extent of γ-tubulin staining as measured by diameter of
each centrosome for 30 cells per condition. P<0.001. (d) Left panel: A549 and B1-KD cells
were immunostained for pericentrin to visualize the centrosomes and counterstained with
4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). Representative confocal microscopy images are
shown. Arrows, indicate amplified centrosomes. White scale bar = 10 μm. Right panel:
percentage of cells with more than two centrosomes was determined in A549 and B1-KD
cells (P<0.01). (e) Drug sensitivity assay in A549 (black line) and B1-KD cells (red line)
treated with a range of different PTX or cisplatin concentrations for 30 h. Cell viability was
measured using the CellTiter-Glo assay and plotted as % survival.

BRCA1 regulates microtubule dynamics. (a) Microtubule regrowth following nocodazoleinduced depolymerization and wash-out, was assessed in A549 and B1-KD cells by
immunostaining with antibodies against α-tubulin and γ-tubulin to mark the centrosome
(arrows mark the center of the centrosome). The length of each microtubule originating from
the centrosome was measured and graphically displayed (right panel, ****P<0.001). White
scale bar = 10 μm. (b) Time-lapse confocal microscopy of EB1-EGFP puncta was
performed for 1-min recording 1 frame per second following transient transfection of A549
and B1-KD cells. The tracks of EB1-EGFP puncta movement are shown with the following
designations: Red = start of track; green = path of puncta during time lapse; blue = end of
track. EB1-EGFP comet velocity was determined for tracks that remained in focus for the
duration of the recording and had a discernible end point (blue). Left: representative single
cell images from each condition are shown. Right: graphic display of average comet velocity
calculated as the ratio of total distance of travel (μm) divided by the duration of recording
time (1 min; ****P<0.001). Average values represent measurements in approximately 30
individual cells per condition. White scale bar = 10 μm. (c) Microtubule dynamics in A549
or B1-KD cell lines were measured with live-cell imaging following transfection of EGFPtubulin. Shown are representative examples of frames from consecutive time points with the
arrow highlighting the tip of a microtubule. Microtubule dynamics were measured by
tracking tips of microtubules using EGFP-tubulin and live-cell spinning disk confocal
microscopy. Quantitation of distinct microtubule dynamics parameters is shown in Table 1.
All parameters measured were significantly different between A549 and B1-KD cell lines
(P<0.001) except the catastrophe frequency (P<0.05; italicized). Scale same as in panel b.

B1-KD impairs PTX-induced microtubule stabilization. (a) A549 and B1-KD cells were
treated with vehicle (dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO)) or 1 μM PTX for 1 h, fixed and
immunostained with α-tubulin and imaged using confocal microscopy. Images were
acquired under identical settings with a 100X/1.4NA objective. Representative cells from
each condition are displayed. Arrows point to PTX-induced microtubule bundles. White
scale bar = 10 μm. (b) Cell-based tubulin polymerization assay in A549 and B1-KD cells.
Upper panel: cells were treated with vehicle (DMSO) or 100 nM PTX for 1 h and subjected
to cell-based tubulin polymerization assay. Briefly, following lysis and centrifugation the
pellet fraction (P), containing polymerized microtubules, was separated from the supernatant
fraction (S), containing soluble tubulin dimers and equal volumes of each were loaded on
adjacent wells on sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS–PAGE)
and immunoblotted for α-tubulin. Ladder band represents 50 kDa. Lower panel: graphic
display of % tubulin in the pellet fraction, which was calculated as the densitometric ratio of
the pellet fraction (P) divided by the total tubulin content (P + S) for each condition. Data
show the average of three biological repeats. (c) Live-cell-based PTX-binding affinity assay:
A549 and B1-KD cells were incubated with 250 nM TubulinTracker for 16 h at 37 °C. After
the incubation, TubulinTracker was washed out three times and replaced with phenol redfree RPMI. Cells were imaged using live-cell confocal microscopy using identical
conditions and images were acquired with a 40X/0.75NA objective. Drug binding to tubulin
was assessed on a single cell by dividing the total cellular fluorescence intensity by the total
area of the cell determined by phase-contrast imaging. One hundred cells per condition were
analyzed. ***P<0.001. (d) Microtubule co-sedimentation assay: A549 cells were lysed,
precleared (HSS) and subjected to a microtubule co-sedimentation assay following addition
of exogenous purified bovine brain microtubule protein. A cycle of tubulin polymerization
was performed at 37 °C for 30 min in the presence of 20 μM PTX and was followed by
centrifugation to separate the microtubule polymer fraction (WP) from the soluble tubulin
dimer fraction (WS). A cycle of depolymerization was performed by subjecting the WP
fraction to cold- and calcium-induced depolymerization. Following centrifugation the coldinsoluble microtubule pellet (CP) was separated from the cold supernatant (CS). Equal
volumes from each fraction were loaded onto adjacent wells of an SDS–PAGE gel and
immunoblotted for α-tubulin and BRCA1. Ladder band in tubulin Immunoblot represents 50

B1-KD impairs PTX-induced caspase-8 microtubule localization and activation. (A) A549
and B1-KD cells were treated with dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO) vehicle (a–f) or 100 nM
PTX (a′–f′) for 18 h, fixed and processed for double immunofluorescence staining using
antibodies specific for the N-terminal domain of caspase-8 (DED domain) or α-tubulin. 4,6Diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) is used to counterstain the nucleus. Images were acquired
under identical settings with a 100X/1.4NA objective of a ZEISS LSM 700 confocal
microscope. White scale bar = 10 μm. Insets depict a higher magnification of the indicated
areas. (B) A549 and B1-KD cells were treated with 100 nM PTX for 18 h, lysed and 50 μg
of total cell protein was run on sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
(SDS–PAGE) and immunoblotted with antibodies against total and cleaved caspase-8. Actin
is used as a loading control. (C) A549 cells were treated with 10 nM PTX for 36 h in the
presence or absence of 30 μM caspase-8 inhibitor (C8i), which was added 2 h before onset
of PTX treatment. Cells were stained for propidium iodide (PI) and annexin-V and analyzed
for apoptosis via flow cytometry. Cell viability (PI and annexin-V negative) was rescued
with C8i pre-treatment. **P<0.01.

Model for the role of BRCA1 in taxane resistance. Here, we show that BRCA1 regulates
microtubules such that the presence of BRCA1 dampens microtubule dynamics. Less
dynamic microtubules encourages the formation of PTX-stabilized microtubule bundles,
which serve as a platform for pro-caspase-8 binding. The accumulation of multiple procaspase-8 molecules, via the induced-proximity activation model, leads to zymogen
cleavage and transactivation of adjacent caspase-8 subunits. Once activated, caspase-8
cleaves downstream substrates that lead to cell death. The absence (or low expression levels)
of BRCA1, leads to more dynamic microtubules by negating BRCA1-mediated suppression
of dynamics. More dynamic microtubules are in turn, poorer substrates for PTX binding.
Lower PTX binding results in fewer stabilized microtubules (bundles), which prevents the
formation of the microtubule-based platforms for pro-caspase-8 accumulation and
activation. Ultimately, the loss of BRCA1 prevents the formation of PTX-stabilized
microtubule bundles rendering the mechanism for caspase-8 activation and downstream
signaling ineffective. Such a mechanism can potentially explain the clinically observed
lower response rate of cancer patients with low BRCA1 expression to taxane-based
chemotherapy.
