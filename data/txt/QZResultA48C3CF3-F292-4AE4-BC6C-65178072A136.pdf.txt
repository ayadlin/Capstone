Abstract
MicroRNA-212 (miR-212) has been reported to play oncogenic or tumor
suppressive role in different human malignancies. Here, we demonstrated that the
mean level of miR-212 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissues was significantly
lower than that in matched tumor-adjacent tissues. Similarly, the expression of miR212 was obviously reduced in HCC cell lines as compared with a nontransformed
hepatic cell line. Ectopic expression of miR-212 inhibited cell viability and proliferation,
and induced apoptosis in HepG2 cells. In contrast, down-regulation of miR-212
increased cell viability and proliferation, and suppressed apoptosis in Bel-7402 cells.
In vivo studies showed that miR-212 inhibited tumor growth of HCC via suppressing
proliferation and inducing apoptosis. Furthermore, we confirmed that Forkhead box
protein A1 (FOXA1) was a direct target of miR-212, and it abrogated the function of
miR-212 in HCC. Finally, we disclosed that the aberrant expression of miR-212 and
FOXA1 was evidently correlated with poor prognostic features of HCC. MiR-212, FOXA1
and their combination were valuable prognostic markers for predicting survival of HCC
patients. In conclusion, miR-212 may serve as a prognostic indicator for HCC patients
and exerts tumor suppressive role, at least in part, by inhibiting FOXA1.

Introduction

MiR-212, which is located at chromosome 17p13.3
[11], has been shown to be deregulated in various
human cancers. MiR-212 serves as a tumor suppressor
in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) [12] and gastric
carcinoma [13]. However, other studies suggest that miR212 exhibits oncogenic properties in colorectal cancer
[14], prostate cancer [15] and pancreatic cancer [16].
Therefore, the biological functions of miR-212 are cancertype specific, partly resulted from the different cellular
contexts of various tumors. Different from miR-122 [1719], which has been actively studied in HCC, miR-212 has
not been investigated in detail in HCC.
Forkhead box protein A1 (FOXA1) is a member
of FOXA gene family, and is an important regulator of
proliferation, apoptosis and cell cycle. It plays oncogenic
roles and has been considered as a predictor of poor
survival in anaplastic thyroid cancer [20] , prostate cancer
[21] and triple-negative breast cancer [22]. FOXA1
promotes hepatocarcinogenesis in male mice and is

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of evolutionarily
conserved noncoding RNAs that act as post-transcriptional
regulators of gene expression through interacting with
the 3’-untranslated region (3’-UTR) of target messenger
RNAs (mRNAs). They participate in various biological
processes [1] including proliferation, apoptosis, cell cycle,
and stem cell renewal. Abundant investigations have
confirmed that deregulation of miRNAs contributes to the
development and progression of human malignancies [2]
including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Furthermore,
miRNAs are closely associated with the diagnosis, clinical
features and survival of patients [3]. Increasing studies
have confirmed that miRNAs play critical roles in the
proliferation [4], apoptosis [5], angiogenesis [6, 7] and
metastasis [8] of HCC. Therefore, miRNAs have been
proposed as promising prognostic markers and attractive
therapeutic targets for HCC patients [9, 10].

responsible for the sexual dimorphism of HCC [23].
FOXA1 has been reported to promote the expression
of Yes-associated protein (YAP), which is a terminal
effecter of Hippo/YAP signaling and contributes to cell
proliferation of liver cancer [24]. Therefore, FOXA1 is
an important contributor of HCC development. But the
clinical significance and regulatory mechanism of FOXA1
expression in HCC are poorly understood.
In this study, we found that miR-212 was downregulated in the majority of HCC tissues. In vitro and
in vivo studies demonstrated that miR-212 suppressed
cell viability and proliferation, and induced apoptosis in
HCC cells. Moreover, we revealed that miR-212 exerted
its biological function, at least in part, by inhibiting
FOXA1 expression. Notably, miR-212, FOXA1 and their
combination are valuable predictors for the prognosis
of HCC patients. Our results elucidate the underlying
mechanism by which miR-212 inhibits HCC, and propose
miR-212 as a potential therapeutic target for HCC.

lines (Bel-7402, Hep3B, Huh7 and HepG2). Reduced
expression of miR-212 was observed in all four HCC
cell lines as compared with LO2 (P < 0.01, Figure 1B).
Notably, the expression of miR-212 in Bel-7402 and
Hep3B cells was higher than that in Huh7 and HepG2 cells
(P < 0.01, Figure 1B). These data indicate that reduced
level of miR-212 may be involved in the development of
HCC.

MiR-212 inhibits HCC cell proliferation and
induces apoptosis in vitro and in vivo
To further explore the biological role of miR-212
in HCC, a miR-212 expression vector and a miR-212
inhibitor (anti-miR-212) was transfected into HepG2 and
Bel-7402 cells, respectively. As measured by qRT-PCR,
miR-212 expression vector significantly increased the
level of miR-212 in HepG2 cells (P < 0.01, Figure 2A),
while the anti-miR-212 vector significantly reduced the
expression of miR-212 in Bel-7402 cells (P < 0.01, Figure
2B). MTT and BrdU assays demonstrated that forced
expression of miR-212 in HepG2 cells (HepG2-miR-212)
resulted in significant decrease of cell viability and
proliferation (P < 0.01, respectively, Figure 2B and 2C),
while down-regulation of miR-212 in Bel-7402 cells (Bel7402-anti-miR-212) showed remarkable increase of cell
viability and proliferation as compared with control cells
(P < 0.01, respectively, Figure 2B and 2C). Moreover, as
determined by flow cytometry and caspase 3/7 activity
assays, miR-212 overexpression increased the percentage
of apoptotic HepG2 cells (P < 0.01, for both assays, Figure
2D and 2E) and its down-regulation inhibited apoptosis in
Bel-7402 cells (P < 0.01, for both assays, Figure 2D and
2E).

Results
The expression of miR-212 is down-regulated in
HCC tissues and cell lines
To determine the expression status of miR-212
in HCC, we initially compared the expression of miR212 in 40 pairs of HCC tissues and adjacent non-tumor
tissues. The expression of miR-212 in HCC tissues was
significantly lower than that in matched tumor-adjacent
tissues (P < 0.01, Figure 1A). Next, we evaluated the
relative expression of miR-212 in a nontransformed
hepatic cell line (LO2) and a panel of human HCC cell

To further confirm these results in vitro, HepG2 cells
that were transfected with miR-212 or control vector were
implanted subcutaneously into nude mice. Tumor growth
curves, generated over 21 days, revealed that up-regulation
of miR-212 significantly slowed down tumor growth
in mice (P < 0.01, Figure 3A). Importantly, the isolated
tumor tissues were subjected to immunohistochemistry for
Ki67 and TUNEL assays. Our data confirmed that forced
expression of miR-212 inhibited cell proliferation and
induced apoptosis in vivo (P < 0.01, respectively, Figure

3B). These results indicate that miR-212 adversely affects
tumor growth of HCC by inhibiting cell viability and
proliferation, and inducing apoptosis.

FOXA1 is a direct downstream target of miR-212
To find out the molecular mechanism responsible
for the biological functions of miR-212 in HCC cells,
we searched for candidate target genes of miR-212 by

using public databases including TargetScan (http://
www.targetscan.org/) and miRanda (microrna.org and
miRbase). Finally, we found that the 3’-UTR of FOXA1
mRNA contained the complementary sequence of miR212 (Figure 4A). This finding suggests that FOXA1, an
important regulator of cell proliferation and apoptosis,
may be a direct downstream target of miR-212. To confirm
this prediction, we first examined the relationship between
miR-212 and FOXA1 expression in HCC cases. As
presented in Figure 4B, the expression of FOXA1 in miR212 high-expressing HCC tissues was significantly lower
than that in miR-212 low-expressing cases (P < 0.01).
Next, Western blot analysis was performed to determine
the effect of altering miR-212 expression on FOXA1

abundance in HCC cells. Additionally, we examined the
expression of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and Yes-associated
protein (YAP), of which the expression could be regulated
by FOXA1. Overexpression of miR-212 in HepG2 cells
dramatically reduced the expression of FOXA1 (P <
0.01, Figure 4C). The expression of AFP and YAP, the
downstream targets of FOXA1, were reduced accordingly
in miR-212 overexpressing HepG2 cells (P < 0.01,
respectively, Figure 4C). In contrast, down-regulation of
miR-212 resulted in increased expression of FOXA1, AFP
and YAP in Bel-7402 cells (P < 0.01, respectively, Figure
4C). Furthermore, we confirmed the regulatory effect of
miR-212 on FOXA1, AFP and YAP in xenograft tumor
tissue (Supplementary Figure 1). These results confirmed

in the HepG2-miR-212 group was significantly higher than that in the HepG2-miR-control group. n = six, * P < 0.05, ** P < 0.01 by t test.

that miR-212 inversely regulated FOXA1 abundance in
HCC cells. Herein, we performed dual-luciferase reporter
gene assays to determine whether miR-212 could directly
target 3’-UTR of FOXA1 mRNA to regulate its expression.
As expected, miR-212 significantly inhibited the luciferase
activity of FOXA1 containing a wild-type (wt) 3’-UTR
but did not suppress activity of FOXA1 with a mutant (mt)
3’-UTR (P < 0.01, Figure 4D). When anti-miR-212 was
transfected, a significant increase in luciferase activity of
wt FOXA1 3’-UTR was observed. However, transfection
of anti-miR-212 did not lead to obvious alteration of the
luciferase activity of FOXA1 containing mt FOXA1 3’UTR (P < 0.01, Figure 4D). These data strongly suggest
FOXA1 is a direct downstream target of miR-212 in HCC.

cells partially abrogated the effect of exogenous miR212, resulting in significant increase of cell viability and
proliferation (P < 0.01, respectively, Figure 5B and 5C)
and obvious decrease of apoptosis (P < 0.01, respectively,
Figure 5D and 5E). As a control group, HepG2-miRcontrol cells transfected with FOXA1 expression plasmid
showed similar change of protein expression and cell
function (Supplementary Figure 2). Similarly, silencing
of FOXA1 in Bel-7402-anti-miR-212 cells partially
abolished the effect of anit-miR-212 on cell viability,
proliferation and apoptosis (P < 0.05, respectively, Figure
5B - 5E). These results demonstrate that FOXA1 is a
downstream mediator for the function of miR-212 in HCC.

Clinical significance of miR-212 and FOXA1 in
HCC patients

Altering expression of FOXA1 influences the
effect of miR-212 on HCC Cells

After confirming the functional role of miR-212
and FOXA1 in HCC, we further evaluated their clinical
significance in 95 HCC patients. As shown in Table 1,
decreased level of miR-212 was associated with high
serum AFP level (P = 0.032), large tumor size (P = 0.018)
and advanced TNM tumor stage (P = 0.031). Meanwhile,
increased expression of FOXA1 was correlated with
large tumor size (P < 0.001), venous infiltration (P =
0.002), high Edmondson-Steiner grading (P = 0.028),

To further determine whether FOXA1 is a functional
target of miR-212, we restored the FOXA1 expression in
HepG2-miR-212 cells by transfecting FOXA1 expression
plasmid. FOXA1 expression was significantly upregulated in HepG2-miR-212 cells after FOXA1 plasmid
transfection, and resulted in obvious up-regulation of YAP
and AFP (P < 0.01, respectively, Figure 5A). Functionally,

expression of FOXA1 had the lowest OS and DFS (Figure
6E and 6F). In contrast, HCC patients with high expression
of miR-212 and low expression of FOXA1 had the best
OS and DFS (Figure 6E and 6F). Thus, combination of
miR-212 and FOXA1 was an independent prognostic
predictor for OS and DFS in HCC.

and advanced TNM stage (P < 0.001). These results
indicate that aberrant expression of miR-212 and FOXA1
is correlated with poor clinical features of HCC patients.
Furthermore, we investigated the prognostic value of
miR-212 and FOXA1. Compared with patients with
high level of miR-212, patients with low expression of
miR-212 had shorter overall survival (OS) (P = 0.002,
Figure 6A) and disease free survival (DFS) (P < 0.001,
Figure 6B). Otherwise, OS and DFS of patients in the
high FOXA1 group were significantly decreased (P <
0.001, respectively, Figure 6C and 6D). Multivariate Cox
regression analysis showed that miR-212 level, FOXA1
expression, tumor size, TNM stage and Edmondenson
stage were independent prognostic predictors for both OS
and DFS (Table 2). Next, we divided patients into four
subgroups based on miR-212 and FOXA1 expression
levels. Patients with low expression of miR-212 and high

Discussion
Numerous studies have demonstrated the critical
roles for miRNAs whereby they participate in the initiation
and progression of human cancers. Exploration of cancerspecific miRNAs and their downstream targets contributes
to the identification of novel biomarkers and therapeutic
targets for human cancers. In this study, we initially

expression of miR-212 was impaired in HCC tissues.
Furthermore, miR-212 was reduced in HCC cell lines as
compared with a normal hepatic cell line. These results
indicate that miR-212 may be a novel tumor suppressor
and may play a critical role in hepatocarcinogenesis.
Sustaining proliferation and resistance of cell death are
two prominent hallmarks of cancer cells [25]. MiR-212

has been found to inhibit proliferation of gastric cancer
by repressing retinoblastoma binding protein-2 [13].
And in NSCLC, it negatively regulates the anti-apoptotic
protein PED and increases TRAIL-induced cell death
[12]. But another study reported that miR-212 promoted
pancreatic cancer cell proliferation by inhibiting patched-1
in pancreatic cancer [16]. Therefore, the influence of

expression of FOXA1 had shorter C. OS and D. DFS. HCC Patients in subgroup I had shortest E. OS and F. DFS, which were divided based

subgroup III: high miR-212/high FOXA1; subgroup IV: high miR-212/low FOXA1). For each cohort, subgroups were divided according
to the cutoff values of miR-212 and FOXA1, which was defined as the mean value of the cohort.

FOXA1 and the combination of miR-212 and FOXA1
were independent prognostic indicators for OS and DFS
of HCC patients. And the prognostic significance of the
combination of miR-212 and FOXA1 was more valuable
than miR-212 or FOXA1 alone.
Currently, restoration of tumor suppressive miRNAs
expression seems to be a promising strategy for cancer
treatment [3]. Using the mimics for miR-34a and let-7
[31] or lentiviral vectors encoding let-7 [32] has achieved
remarkable therapeutic benefit in both murine and human
NSCLC. Thus, miR-212 mimics or viral vectors encoding
miR-212 may also become the treatment options for HCC
in the future. Moreover, results of our in vitro and in vivo
experiments suggest that miR-212 may be a therapeutic
target for HCC. Therefore, comparing the advantage of
miR-212 targeted therapies to conventional and targeted
drugs (e.g. sorafenib) for HCC will be of great importance
in further study.
In conclusion, we find that miR-212 is downregulated in HCC and its decreased expression is
associated with poor prognostic features. In vitro and in
vivo studies indicate that miR-212 inhibits tumor growth
by inhibiting HCC cell proliferation and promoting
apoptosis. Mechanistically, we suggest that miR-212
inhibits HCC cell viability and proliferation, and induces
apoptosis by suppressing FOXA1. Notably, miR-212,
FOXA1, and the combination of miR-212 and FOXA1 are
independent prognostic factors for OS and DFS of HCC
patients. Taken together, we consider that miR-212 may
potentially act as a clinical biomarker, and may also be a
therapeutic target, in HCC.

miR-212 on proliferation and apoptosis of malignant
cells seems to be elusive and may be dependent on the
type of cancer cells. In this study, with in vitro and in vivo
experiments, we confirmed that miR-212 inhibited cell
viability and proliferation, and promoted apoptosis of
HCC cells.
To further understand the underlying mechanisms by
which miR-212 exerts its biological effects on HCC cells,
it is necessary to identify its downstream functional targets.
FOXA1, an important regulator of cell proliferation and
apoptosis, has been found to promote the development of
HCC in male mice [23]. Elevated expression of FOXA1
has been observed in liver cancer cells [26]. Moreover,
two public databases (TargetScan and Miranda) facilitated
us to find out that FOXA1 was one of the predicted targets
of miR-212. In this study, we confirmed that FOXA1
was a direct downstream target of miR-212 and it was
implicated in the functional effect of miR-212 on HCC.
An inverse correlation between the expression of miR-212
and FOXA1 protein was observed in HCC tissues. Upregulation of miR-212 significantly reduced the expression
of FOXA1 in HepG2 cells, whereas down-regulation of
miR-212 increased the expression of FOXA1 in Bel-7402
cells. Overexpression of miR-212 decreased the luciferase
reporter activity of FOXA1 wt 3’-UTR but not mt 3’UTR. Finally, we confirmed that restoration of FOXA1
expression partly abrogated the functional effect of miR212 on HCC cell viability, proliferation and apoptosis.
Taken together, these data provide solid evidences to
support that miR-212 exerts it inhibitory effect on HCC,
at least in part, through inhibiting FOXA1.
Furthermore, it is interesting to mention that AFP
is a well-defined downstream target of FOXA1 [27],
and a widely used biomarker for the early detection and
diagnosis of HCC [28]. Our study indicated that miR-212
decreased the expression of AFP by inhibiting FOXA1.
Due to its association with AFP, miR-212 can potentially
serve as a diagnostic biomarker for HCC. Therefore,
it is worth to examine the sensitivity, specificity, and
ROC on miR-212 as a diagnostic biomarker for HCC
in further study. A recent study showed that YAP was
a novel downstream target of FOXA1 [24]. And YAP
overexpression is an early event in liver tumorigenesis
[29] and can serve as an independent prognostic indicator
for HCC patients [30]. Our data confirmed that miR-212
down-regulated YAP expression by inhibiting FOXA1.
Therefore, miR-212/FOXA1/YAP pathway potentially
plays an important role in HCC. Further experiments are
needed to determine the function of this pathway in HCC.
The critical role of miR-212 and FOXA1 in the
tumor growth and their aberrant expressions in HCC
tissues promoted us to examine their clinical significance.
Interestingly, we confirmed, for the first time, that
decreased level of miR-212 and elevated expression
of FOXA1 were associated with poor clinical features
of HCC. Furthermore, we confirmed that miR-212,

Materials and Methods
Clinical samples and data
A total of 95 HCC samples and paired normal
tumor-adjacent samples (>2cm distance from the margin
of resection) were collected and used after obtaining
informed consent. All patients received curative resection
of their primary HCC in the Department of Hepatobiliary
Surgery at the First Affiliated Hospital of Xi’an Jiaotong
University during January 2006 to December 2008 with
a median follow-up time of 38.7 months. All enrolled
patients did not receive any perioperative chemotherapy
or embolization. All protocols of this study are approved
by the Ethics Committee of Xi’an Jiaotong University.
Patients’ demographic and clinicopathologic data
was obtained through review of hospital records. And
disease recurrence and survival information was updated
at each follow-up visit. The time between surgery date and
first disease recurrence date was calculated as DFS. The
time between the diagnostic biopsy or surgery date to death
or last follow-up was determined as OS duration. The

are presented in Table 1. Then, we divided these enrolled
patients into different subgroups based on the expression
of miR-212 and FOXA1. The clinical features and survival

the clinical significance and prognostic value of miR-212
and FOXA1.

following criteria: 0, less than10%; 1, 10–30%; 2, 31–
50%; 3, more than 50%.

Immunoblotting
Cells and xenograft tumor tissues were lysed in
RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1%
TritonX-100, 5 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid).
Protein concentration was determined using the BCA
Kit (Pierce, IL, USA). Protein samples (30 ug) were
separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis and transferred onto a nitrocellulose
membrane. The blots were then probed with antibodies
against the following primary antibodies: FOXA1
(1:1000), YAP (1:1000, #12395, Cell signaling, Danvers,
MA, USA), AFP (1:1500, #3903, Cell signaling,
Danvers, MA, USA) and β-actin (1:1000, #12262, Cell
signaling, Danvers, MA, USA). Blots were incubated
with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse
or anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (1:5000-1:10000, BioRad, Hercules, CA, USA) and detected using the Bio-Rad
Gel imaging system.

Cell lines and transfection
Four HCC cell lines (HepG2, Huh7, Hep3B,
and Bel-7402), and the human immortalized normal
hepatocyte cell line (LO2) were obtained from the Institute
of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Chinese Academy of
Sciences, Shanghai, China. All cells were cultured in
complete Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (DMEM,
Gibco, Grand Island, NY, USA) containing 10% fetal
bovine serum (FBS, Gibco) with 100 units/mL penicillin
and 100 μg/mL streptomycin (Sigma, St-Louis, MO, USA)
in a humidified containing of 5% CO2 incubator at 37°C.
MiRNA vectors, including miR-212 expression
vector (HmiR0269-MR04), the control vector for miR212 (CmiR0001-MR04), miR-212 inhibitor (HmiRAN0319-AM04) and the negative control for the miR212 inhibitor (CmiR-AN0001-AM04), were purchased
from Genecopoeia (Guangzhou, China). Plasmids
carrying human FOXA1 were purchased from OriGene
(SC108256, Beijing, China). Cells were seeded at 1 ×
105 cells per well in a six-well plate and transfected with
synthetic miRNA vectors and FOXA1-expression plasmid
using Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer’s
instructions (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA).

Real-time quantitative reverse transcription
polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR)
The PCR amplification for the quantification of the
miR-212 and U6 was performed using TaqMan miRNA
Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystms, Foster
City, CA, USA) and TaqMan Human MiRNA Assay Kit
(Applied Biosystems). The relative expression of miR-212
was shown as fold difference relative to U6.

Immunohistochemical staining

Cell viability and proliferation assays

Immunohistochemistry was performed on
paraformaldehyde-fixed paraffin sections. Paraffin
embedded samples were cut into 4 μm-thick sections,
which were baked at 60 °C for at least 6 hours. Paraffin
sections were then deparaffinized in xylene and rehydrated through graded ethanol. Antigen retrieval was
performed in sodium citrate buffer for 2 minutes in a
pressure cooker, and then these slices were quenched for
endogenous peroxidase activity in 3% hydrogen peroxide
for 10 min. They were blocked with goat plasma at 37
°C for 30 minutes and incubated with FOXA1 antibody
(1:100, #5089, Abcam, Cambridge, MA) or Ki-67
antibody (1:100, #9027, Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA,
USA) at 4 °C overnight. The biotinylated secondary
antibody (ZSGB-Bio, Beijing, China) was used to detect
the primary antibody. Then sections were incubated
with diaminobenzidine before being counterstained with
hematoxylin. At last, they were dehydrated in graded
ethanol and transparentized in xylene. The percentage of
positive tumor cells or hepatocytes was graded as per the

2 × 103 HCC cells were seed in 96-well plates
and the 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyl
tetrazolium bromide (MTT, Roche, USA) assay was
employed to assess cell viability at 12, 24 and 36 hours.
For proliferation assay, a Cell Proliferation ELISA, BrdU
(5-bromodeoxyuridine) (chemiluminescent) (Roche, USA)
was used as previously described [33].

Cell apoptosis detection
The apoptosis of cells was evaluated by the
Annexin-V-FLUOS Staining Kit (Roche, USA), as
previously described [34]. The caspase-3/7 activity
assay was measured using an Apo-ONE® Homogeneous
Caspase-3/7 Assay (Promega, Madison, WI, USA), as
described in our previous study [35].

Luciferase reporter assay

This study was supported by grants from the
National Natural Science Foundation of China [no.
81402039 and 81272645].

The 3’-UTR sequence of FOXA1 predicted to
interact with miR-212 or the mutated sequence within the
predicted target sites was synthesized and inserted into
the pGL3 control vector (Promega, Madison, WI, USA).
These constructs were named as wt FOXA1-3’UTR or
mt FOXA1-3’UTR, respectively. Then, HepG2 cells (1 ×
105) were seeded into 24-well plates, and were cultured in
OptimMEM reduced serum media (Life Technologies) as
per the recommended conditions, and were cotransfected
with 200 ng of each luciferase reporter construct (the wt
or mt 3’-UTR of FOXA1 mRNA) and miR-212 expression
vector, miR-212 inhibitor, control vector or negative
control (50 nM) using Fugene (Promega, Madison, WI,
USA). After 48 h, the cells were harvested and luciferase
activity was measured using the dual-luciferase reporter
assay system (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). Firefly
luciferase activity was normalized to the Renilla luciferase
activity. Results were obtained from three independent
experiments performed in triplicate.

4-6 week-old female BALB/c nude mice (Centre
of Laboratory Animals, The Medical College of Xi’an
Jiaotong University, Xi’an, China) were used to establish
the nude mouse xenograft model. 5 × 106 HepG2 cells
transfected with miR-212 expressing or control vectors
were mixed in 150 uL of Matrigel and were inoculated
subcutaneously into the flank of nude mouse. Tumor
volume was determined by measuring two of its
dimensions with calipers every 7 days, and then calculated
as tumor volume = length × width × width/2. All mice
were sacrificed at 3 weeks after the injection of HCC
cells. The xenograft tumor tissues were explanted for
pathological examination. Apoptosis cells in the isolated
tumor tissues were detected using the TUNEL assay as
described before. All in vivo protocols were approved by
the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Xi’an
Jiaotong University.
