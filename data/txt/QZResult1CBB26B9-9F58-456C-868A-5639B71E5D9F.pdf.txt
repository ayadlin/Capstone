The role of CRM1 as an exportin was first elucidated through the
use of a highly cytotoxic polyketide natural product known as
leptomycin B (LMB; refs. 2, 3). LMB was found to be very potent
in vitro against various cancer cell lines (IC50 values in the
0.1–10 nmol/L range). The potent activity of LMB stems from
highly specific binding and inhibition of CRM1, thereby blocking
CRM1-mediated protein export from the nucleus. LMB covalently
inhibits CRM1 through a Michael addition of Cys528 onto LMB,
and mutation of this cysteine residue prevents the covalent
interaction and provides resistance to LMB (4, 5).
Based on its nanomolar potency against cancer cell lines, the
in vivo activity of LMB was examined in a number of murine
xenograft cancer models. It was found to show only modest efficacy
(6). Despite its relatively narrow therapeutic window in mouse
tumor models, a single phase I trial of LMB was done. Its clinical
development was subsequently discontinued due to the significant
toxicity observed without apparent efficacy (7).
Notwithstanding its initial failure in the clinic, LMB could serve
as the paradigm for a novel class of cancer therapeutics. These
compounds would derive their activity by preventing cytoplasmic
localization and inactivation of important tumor suppressors that
are dependent on CRM1 for nuclear export, such as p53. It has been
estimated that roughly 50% of cancers maintain wild-type p53 (8).
In many of these cases, the tumor suppressor function is
compromised by overexpression or inactivation of cellular factors
that regulate the levels of p53 in the nucleus or lead to its enhanced
export out of the nucleus (1). When p53 is activated in the nucleus,
it can promote either cell cycle arrest or apoptotic cell death,
depending on the environment and level of cell stress. p53 function
is negatively regulated in part by a murine double minute-2–
dependent pathway that results in both nuclear export and
ubiquitin-dependent degradation of p53. In many cancer cells,
such as human papilloma virus (HPV)–positive cancers, aberrant
cytoplasmic localization and/or degradation of p53 prevents the
activation of pathways that would lead to cell death (9–11).
Consequently, a means of relocalizing the antioncogenic wild-type
p53 to the nucleus in these aberrant cell types is a promising
approach to regaining control of cell proliferation (12). In fact,
previous work has shown that treatment with LMB and
actinomycin D leads to the accumulation of transcriptionally
active p53 in the nucleus of HPV-positive cervical cancer cell lines
resulting in apoptotic death (9). Furthermore, when human
keratinocytes were treated with LMB, induction of apoptosis was
selectively induced in primary cells expressing the HPV oncogenes
(13). Such potent antitumor effects are not limited to HPV-positive
cancers. LMB treatment of prostate cancer cells (14) as well as
neuroblastoma cell lines (15) induces p53 activation, leading to
growth arrest and induction of apoptosis.
To establish the potential utility of nuclear export inhibitors
(NEI) as anticancer drugs, we synthesized derivatives of LMB and

Abstract
The export protein CRM1 is required for the nuclear export of
a wide variety of cancer-related ‘‘cargo’’ proteins including
p53, c-Abl, and FOXO-3A. Leptomycin B (LMB) is a highly
specific inhibitor of CRM1 with significant in vitro potency but
limited in vivo efficacy due to toxicity. We now report a series
of semisynthetic LMB derivatives showing substantially
improved therapeutic windows. Exposure of cancer cells to
these compounds leads to a rapid and prolonged block of
nuclear export and apoptosis. In contrast to what is observed
in cancer cells, these agents induce cell cycle arrest, but not
apoptosis, in normal lung fibroblasts. These new nuclear
export inhibitors (NEI) maintain the high potency of LMB, are
up to 16-fold better tolerated than LMB in vivo, and show
significant efficacy in multiple mouse xenograft models. These
NEIs show the potential of CRM1 inhibitors as novel and
potent anticancer agents. [Cancer Res 2009;69(2):510–7]

Introduction
Transport of macromolecules across the nuclear membrane is
fundamental to the proper functioning of a living cell. For example,
the ability to localize to the nucleus is essential for transcription
factor activation, and spatial separation of proteins is commonly used
as a mechanism for preventing spontaneous signal activation. Many
important tumor suppressors and transcription factors protect cells
by regulating cell growth and apoptosis, and their cytoplasmic
localization can serve as an inactivation mechanism resulting in
uncontrolled growth and the onset of disease (reviewed in ref. 1).
One strategy to prevent cytoplasmic localization of important
transcription factors is to inhibit the proteins responsible for their
nuclear export. The exportin CRM1 is absolutely required for the
nuclear export of a wide variety of cancer-related ‘‘cargo’’ proteins
including p53, c-Abl, and FOXO-3A (2). CRM1 recognizes its cargo
proteins through their leucine-rich nuclear export sequence. The
CRM1-cargo complex is then actively transported across the
nuclear pore complex to the cytoplasm where the cargo is released
after RanGAP-catalyzed GTP hydrolysis.

instructions. Approximately 4,000 cells were treated with serial dilutions
of compound for 72 h, and luminescence was measured on a Wallac Victor2
multilabel plate reader (Perkin-Elmer).
Animals. Five- to eight-week-old female nu/nu nude and C57Bl/6 mice
were purchased from Harlan Sprague-Dawley, Inc. Food and water were
supplied ad libitum. All work in mice was done in accordance with
guidelines established by our Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.
The animal facility at Kosan is accredited by the Association for Assessment
and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care.
Determination of maximum tolerated dose of NEIs. C57Bl/6 mice (7–
10 per dose group) were given vehicle or escalating dose levels of NEIs i.v.
via the lateral tail vein either once or on a weekly schedule. Mice were
monitored at least thrice a week for body weight change and clinical
symptoms for 2 to 6 wk. Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was defined as the
highest dose level (of each drug for each schedule) that induced <20% body
weight loss and/or V10% mortality.
Xenograft tumor models. Human cancer cell lines were grown in their
recommended medium and harvested. The cells were resuspended in PBS.
For tumor inoculation, cancer cells (3  106–10  106 per mouse; 0.1 mL/
mouse) were s.c. implanted into the hind flanks of female nu/nu athymic
mice. Animals were monitored at least twice a week for the duration of the
study. Drug treatment was usually initiated when tumors had reached f100
to 150 mm3. For efficacy studies with large tumors, tumors were allowed to
reach >450 mm3 before the drug treatment was initiated. Tumor-bearing
mice were randomized and dosed i.v. via the lateral tail vein with either
vehicle or NEIs on the indicated schedule. The NEIs were formulated in 4%
Cremophor, 6% propylene glycol, 10% ethanol, 80% saline. Tumor
dimensions were measured with calipers and tumor volume was estimated
using the following formula: volume = (length  width  width)/2.
Statistical analyses were carried out with the use of the GraphPad Prism 4
software. All reported P values were from two-way ANOVA tests and P <
0.05 was considered statistically significant.

now report a series of NEIs with substantially improved therapeutic
windows. These new NEIs maintain the high potency of LMB and
are up to 16-fold better tolerated than LMB in mouse models. We
show that exposure of cancer cells to these compounds leads to a
rapid and prolonged block of nuclear export, which is further
associated with an increase in multiple markers of apoptosis. In
contrast to what is observed in cancer cells, these agents induce
cell cycle arrest, but not apoptosis, in normal lung fibroblasts.
These novel CRM1 inhibitors show significant efficacy in multiple
mouse xenograft models, including models of colon and cervical
cancer. Identification of molecules such as these that target CRM1
but with a wider therapeutic window than LMB is of great interest
as a potential novel anticancer therapy.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines and materials. The U20S RevGFP cell line was obtained from
the laboratory of Prof. Pamela Silver (Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston,
MA). All other cell lines were obtained from American Type Culture
Collection. A general method for formation of 24-LMB-amides is described
in Supplementary Materials.
Cytotoxicity assays. Cytotoxicity assays were done using the CellTiterGlo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay (Promega) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Approximately 5,000 cells per well were treated
with drug either continuously or for a 1-h pulse, and cell viability was
measured using the assay after 72 h. For the short-exposure experiments,
the cells were washed with prewarmed medium after 1 h and then
maintained in drug-free medium until viability was assessed at 72 h.
Luminescence was measured on a Wallac Victor2 multilabel plate reader
(Perkin-Elmer).
Cell extracts and Western blot analysis. For extracts from cell culture,
cells were washed with PBS and resuspended in radioimmunoprecipitation
assay buffer [50 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 8), 150 mmol/L NaCl, 1 mmol/L
EDTA, 1% (w/v) NP40, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, 12 mmol/L sodium deoxycholate,
0.9 mmol/L Na3VO4, Roche Complete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail]. Cells
were disrupted by several passages through a syringe; centrifuged for 15 min
at 40,000  g, 4jC; and stored at 20jC until analysis by SDS-PAGE and
Western blotting. Antibodies used include p53 (Bp53-12) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH; both from Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and cleaved caspase-3 (Cell Signaling).
Immunofluorescence. Approximately 5  103 cells were seeded onto
black, tissue culture–treated, optical-bottom 96-well plates (Nalge Nunc)
and grown overnight at 37jC. Medium was removed and replaced with
drug-containing medium. For recovery experiments, cells were treated for
1 h and washed with prewarmed medium, followed by incubation in
medium without drug for the desired recovery period. Plates were fixed
with 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS for 20 min at room temperature and washed
thrice in PBS. Cells were permeabilized and blocked in 10% donkey serum,
0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 30 min at room temperature. Goat-antiRanBP1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibodies were used at 1:50 dilution.
Mouse-anti-p53 antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used at 1:50
dilution. Fluorescent secondary antibodies from Jackson ImmunoResearch
were used at 1:200 dilution. Cells were stained with 1 Ag/mL Hoechst 33342
(Invitrogen). Images were acquired and analyzed using a Cellomics
ArrayScan Vti with Molecular Translocation software. A minimum of 500
cells per well were analyzed.
Cell cycle analysis. Cells were harvest by trypsinization, washed in PBS,
and fixed at a final concentration of 70% ice-cold ethanol. Cells were stored
at 20jC, washed in PBS, and then stained in propidium iodide/RNase
buffer (BD Biosciences) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Analysis by flow cytometry was done with a Becton Dickinson FACSCalibur.
Apoptosis assays. Annexin V staining was done using the Annexin VFITC Apoptosis Detection Kit (BD Biosciences) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Analysis by flow cytometry was done with a
Becton Dickinson FACSCalibur. Caspase levels were analyzed using the
Caspase-Glo 3/7 Assay (Promega) according to the manufacturer’s

Results
NEIs are potent cytotoxic agents. LMB is a polyketide natural
product that rapidly induces cytotoxic effects in cancer cell lines
via the covalent inhibition of CRM1. For most cancer cell lines,
in vitro IC50 values for a 72-hour exposure are in the subnanomolar
range (Table 1 and data not shown). We reasoned that the covalent
interaction of LMB with CRM1 would result in effects of the drug
that persist beyond the initial drug exposure. To confirm this
hypothesis and to more closely mimic in vivo drug exposures, we
performed cytotoxicity assays with a short drug exposure period.
Drug treatment was followed by continued incubation in drug-free
medium and subsequent measurement of cytotoxicity after 72
hours. With this assay, LMB exposure as short as 1 hour still results
in substantial cytotoxicity. IC50 values under such assay conditions
are <5 nmol/L (Table 1), supporting the conclusion that the effects
of the drug are rapid and long lasting.
To determine whether the potential exists to generate analogues
that could retain potency but with better in vivo tolerance, we
designed a series of semisynthetic LMB analogues, which we
generically term NEIs. This series of LMB derivatives maintain
essentially equivalent in vitro cytotoxicity even after a 1-hour drug
exposure (Table 1). We next determined if our semisynthetic LMB
analogues have a wider therapeutic window than LMB by
establishing MTDs in mice. The semisynthetic NEIs were found
to be substantially better tolerated when the compounds were i.v.
administered as a single bolus injection. The best-tolerated
analogue from our first series, compound 3, has a >15-fold higher
MTD than LMB (2.5 mg/kg for LMB and 40 mg/kg for compound 3;
Table 1). MTDs determined after administration of a single dose
were found to be equivalent to those determined for a weekly

NOTE: IC50 was measured for various human cancer cell lines 72 h after either continuous drugging or a 1-h drug exposure using the Promega CellTiterGlo Assay system. For MTD experiments, female C57Bl/6 mice were used. Seven to 10 animals per dose group were given vehicle or compound i.v. as a
single bolus injection via the lateral tail vein. The MTD was defined as the maximum dose that induced <20% body weight loss for LMB, compound 2,
and compound 3. We lost one mouse on day 3 for compound 1, so the MTD for this molecule was defined by mortality. There was no other mortality
observed at the MTD dose in this study.

Using RanBP1, we showed that nuclear export is completely
blocked by 30 minutes after exposure to 10 nmol/L compound 3
(Fig. 1C). Furthermore, consistent with the covalent nature of the
drug interaction with CRM1, the nuclear export block persists well
beyond the initial drug exposure. On removal of the drug, nuclear
export remains inhibited and does not completely recover until
f24 hours after the initial exposure (Fig. 2). Similar results for both
extent of nuclear export block and time frame of recovery were
seen with exposure to 5 or 10 nmol/L LMB (Fig. 2 and data not
shown). This long recovery time suggests that recovery from

dosing schedule (data not shown). We focused on LMB and
compound 3 to further characterize the mechanism of action and
therapeutic potential of this class of compounds.
Short exposures to NEIs cause an extended block of nuclear
export. To define the kinetics of nuclear export inhibition for this
class of compounds, we examined the subcellular localization of a
protein, RanBP1, which is dependent on CRM1 for nuclear export.
In untreated SiHa (cervical cancer) cells, RanBP1 is localized to the
cytoplasm (Fig. 1A), but treatment with LMB or compound 3
causes rapid accumulation of RanBP1 in the nucleus (Fig. 1B).

Figure 1. Nuclear export is rapidly blocked by treatment with LMB or compound 3. SiHa (human cervical cancer) cells were treated with 10 nmol/L compound 3 or LMB
for the indicated time points up to 2 h. Cells were formaldehyde fixed and stained for RanBP1 (a biomarker for CRM1 inhibition; red) and Hoechst (to define the
nucleus; blue ). A, RanBP1 is localized to the cytoplasm in untreated cells. B, after drug treatment, nuclear localization of RanBP1 is detected in essentially 100% of the
cells. C, for each time point, images were acquired and analyzed using a Cellomics ArrayScan Vti with Molecular Translocation software. By 30 min, RanBP1 is
localized to the nucleus in the entire population. A minimum of 500 cells per well were analyzed.

alterations and caspase activation. SiHa cervical cancer cells were
treated for 1 hour with 10 nmol/L compound 3 followed by drug
removal and continued growth. Seventy-two hours after the initial
drug exposure, f30% of the population is Annexin V positive,
indicative of plasma membrane alterations, which occur in the early
stages of apoptosis (Fig. 3A). Similarly, caspase activation is also
observed in SiHa cells 72 hours after a 1-hour exposure to 25 or
500 nmol/L of compound 3 or LMB (Fig. 3B and data not shown for
25 nmol/L). Induction of apoptosis is observed in many other
human tumor-derived cell lines [e.g., HCT-116 (colon), LoVo (colon),
LNCaP (prostate), A498 (kidney), and others; data not shown].
In contrast, nuclear export inhibition in normal lung fibroblasts
does not lead to the induction of apoptosis, consistent with the
transient growth arrest observed on exposure to NEIs (13, 15).
Although a control compound, staurosporine, caused dramatic
induction of caspases in MRC5, WI-38, and IMR-90 normal lung
fibroblast cell lines, no caspase activation was observed in any of
these cell lines in response to high doses of NEIs (500 nmol/L
compound 3 or LMB; Fig. 3B). Similarly, no Annexin V staining was
observed in MRC5 cells exposed to compound 3 (Fig. 3A) or LMB
(data not shown).
Nuclear export inhibition correlates with sustained p53
overexpression. We showed in multiple p53 wild-type cell lines
that inhibition of nuclear export strongly correlates with upregulation of p53. Using an immunofluorescence assay in a p53
wild-type osteosarcoma cell line (U20S), we showed that p53 is upregulated and localized to the nucleus in a dose-dependent manner
and that p53 up-regulation correlated with nuclear export block
(Fig. 4A). These results are consistent with previous work that
showed that LMB treatment leads to p53 nuclear localization and

nuclear export block requires de novo CRM1 synthesis, and this is
supported by the lack of nuclear export recovery in cells incubated
in the presence of the protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide,
after removal of the NEIs (Supplementary Fig. S1). The kinetics of
nuclear export inhibition and recovery are consistent among
multiple cell types tested including HCT-116 (colon cancer), U20S
(osteosarcoma), A549, NCI-H460 (lung cancers), LNCaP (prostate
cancer), and others (data not shown).
Nuclear export inhibition leads to apoptosis in tumor cell
lines but reversible cell cycle arrest in normal lung fibroblasts.
We next explored the downstream effects of treatment with NEIs.
After a 1-hour exposure to compound 3, persistent cell cycle arrest
is observed in tumor cell lines (SiHa cells) and in normal human
lung fibroblasts (MRC5; Supplementary Table S1). The treated cells
arrest in the G2 and/or G1 phase of the cell cycle, and the
percentage of proliferating cells (S phase cells) is dramatically
reduced in both tumor cells and normal lung fibroblasts, consistent
with what has been previously observed for LMB (15, 16). Moreover,
although normal lung fibroblasts respond to NEIs with a persistent
cell cycle arrest, they remain viable after nuclear export inhibition.
These results are consistent with previous work using multiple
human normal fibroblast cell lines, which showed that cells regain
their ability to proliferate after LMB-induced growth arrest on drug
removal and passage by trypsinization (15). Similar results were
also observed in experiments using normal primary human
keratinocytes, which regain their ability to divide f96 hours after
the withdrawal of LMB (13).
In contrast to what was observed in normal lung fibroblasts,
inhibition of nuclear export in cancer cells leads to an induction of
multiple markers of apoptosis, including plasma membrane

is removed.

activation of p53 in HPV-infected cells (9, 13), we first studied
efficacy in the HPV-positive SiHa cervical cancer model. Tumor
regression was induced by weekly compound 3 treatment for 3
weeks (Fig. 5A), and tumors began to shrink shortly after the

activation in various cell types (9, 13–15, 17). Furthermore, in the
HCT-116 colon cancer cell line, a 1-hour exposure to compound 3
leads to increased cellular p53 expression for up to 48 hours
(Fig. 4B). This result establishes that a downstream response
to CRM1 inhibition, in this case p53 up-regulation, can persist
even after the nuclear export block is reversed at f24 hours
(see Fig. 2).
Previous studies have shown that the cytotoxic effects of LMB
are reduced in human neuroblastoma and cervical cancer cell lines
when the activity of endogenous p53 is abrogated by overexpression of a dominant negative p53 mutant (9, 15). Consistent
with this result, addition of a small-molecule inhibitor of p53,
pifithrin-a (18), blocked compound 3–induced apoptosis in SiHa
cells (Fig. 4C). These results show that p53 can play an important
role in mediating NEI-induced apoptosis.
Novel NEIs show robust efficacy in multiple tumor models.
Because of the strong induction of apoptosis observed in
compound 3 treated cells in culture (see Fig. 3), we harvested
tumor samples to determine if this effect was also observed
in vivo. HCT-116 tumor–bearing mice were treated with a single
i.v. dose of either vehicle or compound 3, and tumors were
harvested 24 hours later. Consistent with the induction of
apoptosis observed in vitro, we observed evidence of increased
apoptosis in vivo, as shown by an increase in the levels of cleaved
caspase-3 (Supplementary Fig. S2).
We next compared the antitumor activities of compound 3
and LMB in mouse xenograft models. Given the strong biological
rationale and supporting in vitro data showing that NEI induced

to nuclear export inhibition. B, HCT-116 colon cancer cells were treated with
10 nmol/L compound 3 for 1 h, followed by a recovery period in drug-free
medium. Cell extracts were made at the indicated times and analyzed by
SDS-PAGE for p53 expression levels. GAPDH is shown as a control for protein
loading levels. C, SiHa cells were treated with 50 nmol/L compound 3 in the
presence or absence of 10 or 30 Amol/L of pifithrin-a, an inhibitor of p53.

1 Amol/L staurosporine.

duration of the antitumor effect of compound 3, we treated SiHa
tumor–bearing mice with either vehicle or compound 3 once a
week for 2 weeks and then monitored tumor response for a
longer period. Compound 3–treated tumors again responded
rapidly after the first dose, and 100% of tumors regressed for at
least 4 weeks. Furthermore, tumors could not be detected in
three of seven mice in the compound 3–treated group between
days 26 and 40. Two of these mice remained tumor-free for >450
days and are considered to be therapeutically cured (Supplementary Fig. S3).
Many anticancer agents are less effective against larger tumors.
To assess the antitumor activity of compound 3 in mice with a
greater tumor burden, we allowed the SiHa tumors to grow to
f500 mm3 before treating with a single i.v. injection of compound
3. We found that a single administration of compound 3 was able
to show antitumor activity in a dose-dependent manner, with
10 mg/kg causing tumor growth inhibition and 40 mg/kg causing
significant tumor regression (Fig. 5B).
To determine if compound 3 is active in other tumor models, we
tested for antitumor activity using an HCT-116 colon cancer
xenograft model. Using this model, we showed that compound 3
significantly inhibited tumor growth when dosed at 30 mg/kg
weekly (Fig. 5C). Furthermore, consistent with results in the SiHa
model, 30 mg/kg of compound 3 was found to be significantly more
efficacious and less toxic than 2.5 mg/kg of LMB (data not shown).
Compound 3 at 30 mg/kg was found to be similarly efficacious as
the 35 or 40 mg/kg dose in the SiHa and HCT-116 models but
better tolerated (inducing only f10% body weight loss), and hence,
30 mg/kg was chosen as an appropriate dose at which to examine
the activity of compound 3 in additional xenograft models.
Antitumor activity was also observed in NCI-H460 (non–small-cell
lung cancer), A375 (melanoma), and K562 [chronic myelogenous
leukemia (CML)] cancer models (Supplementary Table S2). Thus,
NEIs like compound 3, which have a significantly improved
tolerability relative to LMB, show robust efficacy in multiple
xenograft models.

Discussion
In this study, we have synthesized analogues of LMB, the
prototypical NEI, which show potential as novel anticancer
therapeutics. LMB itself has significant in vitro potency but is
poorly tolerated in vivo (6, 7). The covalent nature of the
interaction with CRM1 needs to be considered when comparing
compounds. In vitro IC50 values for covalent inhibitors determined
after prolonged drug exposure cannot be interpreted as indicators
of target binding affinity, as they would be for reversible inhibitors,
because covalent inhibitors have essentially infinite binding affinity
for their target. The IC50 values for NEIs determined after short
drug exposure serve as an indirect measure of the rate of CRM1
inactivation and thereby reflect the relative efficiencies of a series
of compounds at inactivating CRM1. The observation that our
series of NEIs retain essentially equivalent cytotoxicities to LMB
after a 1-hour exposure (Table 1) shows that they retain the
potency of LMB.
To define the kinetics of nuclear export inhibition for this class
of compounds, we wanted to find an endogenous protein that is
dependent on CRM1 for nuclear export and is ubiquitously
expressed. Such a protein could serve as a useful biomarker for
nuclear export in all cell types without the need for additional
inducers of expression or nuclear import. We chose RanBP1, an

tumor volumes were still significantly below those observed
when dosing began, and in fact, two mice had no detectable
tumors. In contrast, only a growth delay was found in the LMBtreated group (Fig. 5A), consistent with the limited in vivo
efficacy previously observed for LMB (6). To further assess the

cancer types, such as SiHa, this prevents the aberrant
cytoplasmic localization and degradation of p53 and leads to
activation of pathways that cause cell cycle arrest and apoptotic
cell death. We show that such effects are not limited to HPVpositive cancers because NEIs induce p53 activation (Fig. 4B)
and show antitumor efficacy in the HCT-116 colon cancer model
(Fig. 5C). Furthermore, we have also tested for antitumor activity
of compound 3 in a variety of other tumor models including
NCI-H460 (non–small-cell lung cancer), A375 (melanoma), and
K562 (CML; Supplementary Table S2). Compound 3 showed
antitumor activity in all of these models, ranging from induction
of tumor regression to tumor growth inhibition. Thus, in
contrast to the poor in vivo activity of LMB, the NEI analogue
compound 3 shows robust efficacy in all xenograft models
examined to date and is of great interest as a potential cancer
therapeutic.
Although we have focused here on p53 wild-type cancer types,
CRM1 mediates the nuclear export of numerous other proteins that
are also important therapeutic targets. Various lines of evidence
provide a strong biological rationale for the use of NEIs in multiple
cancer types. For example, in CML, the oncogenic BCR-Abl tyrosine
kinase is found in the cytoplasm where it activates a number of
mitogenic signaling pathways (20–22). Treatment of CML cells with
the tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib not only inhibits BCR-Abl but
also promotes its shuttling into and out of the nucleus (23).
Coadministration of LMB with imatinib was shown to cause
nuclear accumulation of BCR-Abl, ultimately resulting in the
activation of programmed cell death both in vitro (24) and in ex
vivo experiments (24). Given the poor in vivo tolerance of LMB, a
significant therapeutic benefit could be gained by combining a
potent but better tolerated CRM1 inhibitor with an inhibitor of
BCR-Abl. This combination has the potential to overcome the
problem of drug resistance by eradicating, rather than inhibiting,
the growth of CML cells.
Similarly, LMB inhibition of CRM1 has been shown to
promote the nuclear buildup of the Forkhead family of
transcription factors (FOXOs; refs. 25, 26). These transcription
factors are regulated by multiple signaling pathways that play
critical roles in tumorigenesis, including the PI3K/PTEN/Akt
pathway (reviewed in refs. 27, 28). In PTEN-deficient cells, the
Akt pathway is activated and FOXO transcription factors are
rendered inactive by localization to the cytoplasm. Restoring
PTEN function in these cells blocks Akt activity and restores
nuclear localization of FOXO and, therefore, its ability to activate
downstream factors. Prolonged FOXO residence in the nucleus
leads to the induction of proapoptotic genes and ultimately to
growth arrest and death in PTEN-null tumor cells (29, 30). In
addition, it has recently been shown that localization of FOXO
to the nucleus in PTEN-null cells inhibits Hif1 transcriptional
activity (31), thereby potentially interfering with the ability of
PTEN-null cells to survive under hypoxic conditions. It will thus
be of great interest to examine the efficacy of NEIs in PTENdeficient cancers.
In conclusion, the NEIs we have synthesized have enabled us to
validate CRM1 as a target for anticancer therapeutics. These data
show that the limited in vivo efficacy observed for LMB was a result
of its poor tolerance. The identification of NEIs that are
significantly better tolerated has shown that molecules with this
mechanism of action can show robust in vivo efficacy. These results
provide strong evidence supporting the development of NEIs as a
novel anticancer therapy.

accessory protein for RanGAP-mediated dissociation of CRM1bound cargo proteins on export to the cytoplasm. The rapid
shuttling of RanBP1 into the nucleus makes it a particularly useful
tool for the study of NEIs. Other CRM1-dependent cargo proteins
that are imported more slowly, are not ubiquitously expressed, or
require inducing conditions for their nuclear import are not as
useful for the purpose of defining the kinetics of CRM1 inhibition,
although they could undoubtedly play a role in mediating
downstream cytotoxic effects. Using RanBP1 as a biomarker, our
in vitro experiments show that exposure of cancer cells to NEIs
leads to a rapid and prolonged block of nuclear export in all cell
types tested.
The observation that the induction of p53 is detectable at 24
or 48 hours (Fig. 4B) despite the fact that nuclear export has
recovered in the majority of the cell population by 24 hours
(Fig. 2B and data not shown) shows that the downstream effects
of nuclear export inhibition can persist longer than the actual
nuclear export block. Nuclear entrapment of p53 turns on the
p53 transcriptional program, including activation of transcription
of p53 itself. As the data show, this leads to a significant
increase in p53 protein levels in the cell (Fig. 4; refs. 9, 15, 19).
Once this program is turned on, because it is part of an
autoactivation loop, its regulation need no longer depend on
nuclear export block and will instead depend on factors such as
the stability of p53 and the dynamic point at which p53 levels
drop to the range in which the positive feedback loop is no
longer engaged. Thus, a downstream consequence of nuclear
export inhibition, in this case p53 induction, can persist
independently of the original signal, which was the nuclear
export block.
The inhibition of nuclear export is associated with an increase in
multiple markers of apoptosis in cancer cells. In contrast to this,
NEIs induce cell cycle arrest, but not apoptosis, in normal lung
fibroblasts. Thus, although NEIs cause the inhibition of CRM1 in
both tumor and normal cell types, a difference is observed in the
downstream consequences of this inhibition. The basis of this
difference in response remains under investigation.
We have synthesized novel NEIs that are up to 16-fold better
tolerated than LMB in mouse models while retaining significant
potency. These results suggest that the limited in vivo efficacy of
LMB was likely due to off-target effects because our NEIs retain
the potent inhibition of CRM1, but are clearly better tolerated
in vivo. The reasons why the novel NEIs are better tolerated are
currently under investigation. Areas of exploration include the
tissue distribution profile of these molecules as well as an
investigation of their in vivo on-target and off-target protein
binding properties. The better tolerance enables these novel NEIs
to be dosed at higher levels in vivo. As Fig. 5B shows, 10 mg/kg of
compound 3, which is 4-fold higher than the MTD of LMB, shows
only modest efficacy, whereas a dose of 40 mg/kg results in
regression. This supports the conclusion that the low MTD of
leptomycin limits its efficacy and higher doses are required for
robust efficacy for compounds such as these, which show
comparable activity in vitro. Doses above 30 mg/kg of compound
3 are associated with significant efficacy in multiple mouse
xenograft models, thereby validating nuclear export as a
potentially useful therapeutic target in cancer.
In this study, we have focused on p53 wild-type cancer models
including an HCT-116 colon model and a SiHa cervical cancer
model. In these models, the p53 tumor suppressor becomes
trapped in the nucleus on inhibition of CRM1. In HPV-positive
