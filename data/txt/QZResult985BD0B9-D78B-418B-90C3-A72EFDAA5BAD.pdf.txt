Abstract
Non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is notorious for its paltry responses to ﬁrst-line therapeutic regimens. In
contrast to acquired chemoresistance, little is known about the molecular underpinnings of the intrinsic resistance
of chemo-na€ve NSCLC. Here we report that intrinsic resistance to paclitaxel in NSCLC occurs at a cell-autonomous
level because of the uncoupling of mitotic defects from apoptosis. To identify components that permit escape from
mitotic stress–induced death, we used a genome-wide RNAi-based strategy, which combines a high-throughput
toxicity screen with a live-cell imaging platform to measure mitotic fate. This strategy revealed that prolonging
mitotic arrest with a small molecule inhibitor of the APC/cyclosome could sensitize otherwise paclitaxel-resistant
NSCLC. We also deﬁned novel roles for CASC1 and TRIM69 in supporting resistance to spindle poisons. CASC1,
which is frequently co-ampliﬁed with KRAS in lung tumors, is essential for microtubule polymerization and
satisfaction of the spindle assembly checkpoint. TRIM69, which associates with spindle poles and promotes
centrosomal clustering, is essential for formation of a bipolar spindle. Notably, RNAi-mediated attenuation of CASC1
or TRIM69 was sufﬁcient to inhibit tumor growth in vivo. On the basis of our results, we hypothesize that tumor
evolution selects for a permissive mitotic checkpoint, which may promote survival despite chromosome segregation
errors. Attacking this adaptation may restore the apoptotic consequences of mitotic damage to permit the
therapeutic eradication of drug-resistant cancer cells. Cancer Res; 74(14); 3857–69. 2014 AACR.

Introduction
Paclitaxel is a ﬁrst-line chemotherapeutic agent that
inhibits the dynamic instability of microtubules, thus preventing bi-orientation of chromosomes during mitosis (1).
Although the reduction of breast and ovarian tumor burden
following taxane-based therapies demonstrates efﬁcacy in
these settings, responses in non–small cell lung cancer
(NSCLC) are rarely curative, as only 30% of patients exhibit
a partial response at best, indicating a widespread intrinsic
resistance to antimitotic agents (2, 3). Thus, given the
promise, yet limitation, of current antimitotic therapies, the

identiﬁcation of mechanisms supporting intrinsic resistance
to paclitaxel in NSCLC is essential. Our goal here was to
identify the cell autonomous components that permit
escape from mitotic stress–induced cell death in a paclitaxel-resistant NSCLC setting.
Efﬁcacy of paclitaxel and other antimitotic agents hinges
on the coupling of mitotic defects to cell death. By inhibiting
the dynamic instability of microtubules, paclitaxel disrupts
chromosome alignment, thereby preventing satisfaction of
the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC). The SAC is composed of sentinel proteins, including MAD2 and BUBR1,
which, in the absence of proper microtubule-kinetochore
attachments, inhibit the activity of the anaphase promoting
complex/cyclosome (APC/C; refs. 4 and 5). Nearly all tumor
cells are sensitive to paclitaxel-induced mitotic defects and
engage the SAC. However, live-cell imaging studies have
revealed that the length and outcome of this mitotic arrest
is variable within and among tumor cell lines. For example,
apoptosis may be activated directly from mitotic arrest.
Otherwise, arrested cells undergo mitotic slippage, deﬁned
as an aberrant exit in the presence of misaligned chromosomes thereby forming micronucleated cells that can either
die, arrest, or reenter a subsequent division cycle (6–8). This
slippage from an SAC-mediated mitotic arrest has been
implicated as a survival mechanism, as delaying mitotic
exit, either by inhibiting an activator of the APC/C, CDC20,
or overexpressing cyclin B1, can increase mitotic dwell time
and cell death during or following mitosis (6, 9). The
prolonged mitotic arrest may allow for accumulation of

death signals that trigger apoptosis (10, 11). However, the
molecular components that promote mitotic slippage, particularly in chemoresistant tumor cell lines are unclear.
Previously, we established a pan-genomic, siRNA-based
screening platform to identify gene products that modulate
sensitivity of NSCLC cells to paclitaxel (12). Here, we use this
platform to investigate the molecular components supporting
resistance to paclitaxel in a NSCLC system that exhibits no
loss of viability following exposure to doses as high as 1 mmol/L.
At single cell resolution, we ﬁnd that resistant cells undergo
mitotic slippage and survive as micronucleated cells, indicative
that resistance is because of a regulatory setting that permits
the deﬂection of mitotic stress–induced cell death. In agreement with this notion, a global screen discovered components,
which when depleted, sensitize these chemorefractory cells to
paclitaxel. Suppression of a cohort of these chemosensitizers
induced a protracted mitotic arrest, which we ﬁnd is essential
for postmitotic cell death. Functional elaboration of these
chemosensitizers reveals that prolonging mitotic arrest can
be accomplished either by direct inhibition of the APC/C, or
through collateral spindle damage, because of the depletion of
CASC1 or TRIM69, which we reveal here are novel regulators of
mitotic spindle assembly in tumor cells. Thus, prolonging
mitotic arrest, which can be achieved through multiple avenues, is a dominant mechanism to sensitize otherwise paclitaxel-resistant NSCLC cells.

Materials and Methods
Cells and reagents
Human bronchial epithelial cells (HBEC), NSCLC, 293, and
HeLa cells were a gift from J. Minna and M. White (University of
Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX). HeLa, H1299,
HCC4017, HCC1171, H1299, H1155, and HBEC lines were validated by short tandem repeat analysis. NSCLC cell lines were
maintained in RPMI medium (Gibco) with 5% fetal bovine
serum (FBS). HBEC cell lines were maintained in keratinocyte
medium plus supplements (Gibco). HeLa and 293 cells were
maintained in DMEM with 10% FBS. Paclitaxel (Sigma or
Tocris), proTAME (Boston Biochem), and Nocodazole (Sigma)
were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Cell-Titer Glo
(CTG) and APO-ONE were obtained from Promega. Dharmafect
transfection reagents were obtained from Thermo-Fisher. Control siRNA transfections were performed with either non-targeting siRNA pool (Dharmacon) or a pool targeting DLNB14 (12).
Paclitaxel dose curves
Cell lines were plated in 96-well plates to reach 50% conﬂuence at 48 hours, when they were exposed to paclitaxel for
48 hours. Cell viability assessed using the Cell-Titer Glo assay.
Immunoblotting
Cells were lysed in boiling 2 Laemmli sample buffer and
resolved by SDS-PAGE. Antibodies used as follows: actin,
ANAPC5, CASC1, GAPDH, MCL-1, PDE3B, Myc-A14, Myc9E10, GST (Santa Cruz); cleaved caspase-3 (Epitomics);
MAD2L1 (Covance); TRIM69, b-tubulin (Sigma); pericentrin
(Abcam); phospho-histone-H3 (Millipore).

Immunoﬂuorescence
Cells were grown on glass coverslips, ﬁxed in 3.7% formaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100, and blocked
with PBS, 0.1% Tween-20, 10 mg/mL bovine serum albumin
(PBTA). Slips were incubated with primary antibodies in PBTA
and, following PBTA washes, incubated with Alexa Fluor–
conjugated secondary antibodies (Invitrogen). For BUBR1
staining, cells were ﬁxed in cold methanol. For microtubule
preservation in Fig. 3C, cells were extracted with BRB80 (80
mmol/L PIPES pH 6.8, 1 mmol/L MgCl2, 5 mmol/L EGTA) and
0.5% Triton X-100 for 30 seconds followed by a 0.5% glutaraldehyde ﬁx and 0.1% NaBH4 quench. Slides were imaged on an
Axioimager upright microscope (Zeiss) equipped with a
charge-coupled device camera or a Leica CTR5500 upright
scope with a monochrome digital camera (Leica DFC340 FX).
Quantitation of ﬂuorescence was performed with ImageJ
software and normalized to cytoplasmic ﬂuorescence.
Stable cell line production
Cell lines stably expressing green ﬂuorescent protein-histone H2B (GFP-H2B) or myc-TRIM69A were generated by
retroviral transduction. Retrovirus was produced by transfection of 293GP cells with vesicular stomatitis virus G protein
(VSV-G) and either pCLNCX-GFP-H2B (gift from Gray Pearson) or pLPCX-myc-TRIM69A. Virus was harvested 48 hours
after transfection and transduced cells were selected with
geneticin (pCLNCX-GFP-H2B) or puromycin (pLPCX-mycTRIM69A).
High-content live-cell imaging
Cell lines stably expressing GFP-H2B were transfected in a
96-well plate and exposed to vehicle or paclitaxel 48 hours after
transfection and, unless otherwise indicated, imaged immediately following the addition of paclitaxel. Imaging was performed on a BD Pathway 855 Bioimager using a 40 or a 20
high-numerical aperture objective. Images were taken every 20
minutes for 48 to 72 hours. Image sequences were generated
using ImageJ and manually quantiﬁed.
siRNA screen
A 2-condition, triplicate analysis screen was performed in a
96-well plate format using a Thermo-Fisher library that targets
21,127 unique genes (12). HCC366 cells were transfected with
40 nmol/L siRNAs for 48 hours, followed by exposure to vehicle
or 10 nmol/L paclitaxel for an additional 48 hours. Subsequently, CTG was added and values were read on an EnVision
Plate Reader. The screening protocol was identical to that
previously described with the following exceptions: HCC366
cells were seeded at 1  104, transfected with Dharmafect 2
complexed siRNAs in RPMI medium, and cells were treated at
48 hours after transfection with vehicle or paclitaxel and a ﬁnal
FBS concentration of 10% (12). High interest chemosensitizers
were ranked by z-score (Supplementary Methods).
siRNA transfections
siRNA transfections were performed using Thermo-Fisher
or Sigma siRNA pools. Pools were used at a ﬁnal concentration
of 50 nmol/L for indicated times.

Recoupling Mitotic Stress to Programmed Cell Death

Quantitative reverse transcription PCR
Total RNA was collected using the GenElute Mammalian
Total RNA Miniprep Kit (Sigma). Two micrograms of total
RNA was used in subsequent reverse transcription using the
High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems). Quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR)
was performed with TaqMan gene expression assays and
ribosomal protein L27 (RPL27) was the endogenous control.
Colony formation assays
HCC366 cells were transfected in a 24-well format and
exposed to 0 and 10 nmol/L paclitaxel 48 hours after transfection. Ninety-six hours after transfection, 2  103 viable cells
were replated in a 6-well format. Cells were fed biweekly for up
to 3 weeks before formaldehyde ﬁxation and Geimsa staining.
Colonies were counted manually.
Microtubule regrowth assay
Cells were exposed to 11 mmol/L nocodazole for 1 hour, 72
hours after transfection. Cells were then rinsed with PHEM
buffer (60 mmol/L PIPES, 25 mmol/L HEPES, 10 mmol/L
EGTA, 2 mmol/L MgCl2, 1 mmol/L paclitaxel) and placed in
fresh media to recover for the time indicated. Cells were then
permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 1 minute then ﬁxed
and immunostained.
In vivo polymerized tubulin assay
Seventy-two hours after transfection, cells were lysed in
microtubule stabilizing buffer (100 mmol/L PIPES, 2 mol/L
glycerol, 0.1 M MgCl2, 2 mmol/L EGTA, 0.5% Triton X-100,
5 mmol/L paclitaxel). Subsequently, whole-cell lysates samples
were collected and centrifuged for 30 minutes at 4 C and
16,000  g. The supernatant (monomeric tubulin) was collected and pellet (polymerized tubulin) resuspended in microtubule stabilizing buffer. Fractions were resolved by SDS-PAGE.
cDNA expression and plasmids
Cells were transfected with cDNA expression vectors using
Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Plasmids used: Tomato-H2B,
pCMV-myc (Clontech), pCMV-myc-TRIM69A, pCMV-mycTRIM69B, and pCMV-myc-TRIM69A (C50S/C53S).
Tumor xenografts
pLKO.1 vectors expressing short hairpin RNA (shRNA) were
used to generate lentivirus to infect HCC366 cells. Target
knockdown was assessed 72 hours after infection. Cells were
harvested 96 hours after infection and 2  106 cells were
injected into the ﬂank of female NSG (NOD.Cg-Prkdcscid
Il2rgtm1Wjl/SzJ JAX) mice. The protocol used 10 week old mice
weighing 20–26 grams. A total of 3  106 cells in 4-week old
mice weighing 15–20 grams were used for paclitaxel studies.
Mice were bred at University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill,
Chapel Hill, NC. All mice were maintained in sterile conditions
according to an approved Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee protocol and abiding by all University of North
Carolina Animal Welfare guidelines. Tumor growth was monitored by caliper measurement at indicated time points. In
paclitaxel experiments, mice were treated with 20 mg/kg of

www.aacrjournals.org

paclitaxel starting 10 days after injection, at a frequency of 2
days per week for 4 weeks.
Hematoxylin and eosin staining
Tumors from xenograft mouse studies were excised and
formalin ﬁxed and parafﬁn embedded. Tissue was processed
by routine microtomy into 5 to 6 mm sections for automated
staining. At least 7 ﬁelds were manually quantitated for micronucleated cells.
TUNEL staining
Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase–mediated dUTP nick
end label (TUNEL) staining for apoptotic cells in tissue sections
was performed using the DeadEnd Fluorometric TUNEL System (Promega) standard protocol. Apoptotic cells were labeled
with ﬂuorescein, and the sections were counterstained with
propidium iodide. At least 6 ﬁelds were counted per sample.

Results
Pan-genomic screening reveals components that
liberate tumor cells from mitotic stress–induced death
As a discovery platform for identifying mechanisms that
promote resistance to paclitaxel-induced cell death, we selected HCC366 cells, a member of a cohort of NSCLC cell lines,
which undergo limited viability loss and no activation of
caspase-3 following exposure to escalating doses of paclitaxel
(Fig. 1A and B). Although cell lines in this cohort exhibit
minimal viability loss following paclitaxel exposure, a 10
nmol/L dose is sufﬁcient to induce multipolar spindles, misaligned chromosomes, and generate micronucleated progeny
(Fig. 1C and Supplementary S1A), indicating that these cells
have an intact SAC. Live-cell imaging studies demonstrated
that paclitaxel induced a MAD2- and BUBR1-dependent mitotic arrest that uniformly led to mitotic slippage and the generation of micronucleated progeny (Fig. 1D). Single-cell lineage
tracing of HCC366 micronucleates, beginning 72 hours after
paclitaxel exposure, revealed that the majority (92%) of these
cells continued to survive for 40 hours and 8% successfully
underwent a subsequent division cycle (Fig. 1E and Supplementary Fig. S1B and Supplementary Video S1). Replating
assays revealed that 40% to 50% of treated cells were capable
of colony formation, indicating that these cells, despite mitotic
damage, maintain the capacity to proliferate (Supplementary
Fig. S1C). In contrast, a representative sensitive cell line, H1155,
undergoes a dramatic mitotic arrest resolved by either cell
death or micronucleation at 100 nmol/L (Supplementary
Fig. S1D). The HCC366 mitotic slippage response was also
recapitulated in vivo, as tumors grown subcutaneously in
immune-deﬁcient mice exposed to paclitaxel were composed
of micronucleated cells (Fig. 1F). This ﬁnding suggests that
HCC366 cells harbor a regulatory context in which mitotic
stress is uncoupled from tumor cell death, leading to paclitaxel
resistance and continued tumor cell proliferation.
To comprehensively investigate the molecular basis for
deﬂection of paclitaxel-induced death, we performed a pangenomic, siRNA-based loss of function screen in the presence
and absence of 10 nmol/L paclitaxel in HCC366 cells (Supplementary Fig. S1E and S1F). This analysis returned 49 candidate

Recoupling Mitotic Stress to Programmed Cell Death

siRNA pools with a z-score of <2.5 that correspond to
annotated genes in the human GENE database (see Supplementary Methods, Table S1 and S2).
We further stratiﬁed these siRNAs using a secondary screening strategy to measure caspase-3/-7 activity and mitotic transit
time for 23 candidates selected from diverse functional categories (Fig. 2A; Supplementary Fig. S2A and S2B, and Supplementary Table S1). Target mRNA knockdown was also evaluated (Supplementary Fig. S2C). This counter screen returned
9 targets whose inhibition activated apoptotic signaling, 4 of
which increased mitotic transit time at least 20%. Colony
formation assays revealed a 50% decrease in replating efﬁciency, indicating that the cell death observed was sufﬁcient
to reduce survival of the population (Fig. 2B). This ﬁnding
indicated that even in slippage prone NSCLC, a number of
molecular mechanisms exist to enhance SAC robustness.
Thus, we focused on this cohort of ANAPC5, PDE3B, CASC1,
and TRIM69 for further mechanistic elaboration. All 4 of
these siRNA pools met our off-target validation criteria of 2
independent siRNAs or nonredundant pools reproducing the
apoptotic phenotype (Supplementary Fig. S2D).
Single-cell lineage tracing revealed that the prolonged mitotic arrest in target-depleted cells resolved as mitotic slippage to
generate micronucleated progeny; 40% to 50% of which subsequently died as measured by cell blebbing and a loss of
movement (Fig. 2C). Indicative of a functional conservation of
these genes across multiple genetic backgrounds, their inhibition enhanced paclitaxel-induced mitotic arrest in HCC1171,
HCC515, and H2887, cell lines that also exhibit a deﬂection of
mitotic stress–induced death (Supplementary Fig. S2E). Thus,
prolonging mitotic arrest induced a postmitotic apoptotic
response.
Restoring paclitaxel sensitivity requires a protracted
mitotic arrest
Of these validated genes, ANAPC5 is the best characterized as encoding a scaffold in the multiprotein APC/C
complex, whose inhibition attenuates the proteolytic cascades required for anaphase onset (13). Although roles for
CASC1, TRIM69, and PDE3B in mitosis have not been
described, their identiﬁcation in a cohort with ANAPC5
suggests that they may contribute to APC/C inhibition.
Indeed, codepletion of CASC1, TRIM69, or PDE3B with
MAD2 signiﬁcantly reduced mitotic transit time in the
presence of paclitaxel (Supplementary Fig. S3A). Codepletion also rescued micronucleated cell death as assessed by
live-cell imaging and cleaved caspase-3 protein levels (Fig.
2D and Supplementary Fig. S3B).
The prosurvival protein, MCL-1, is degraded during a prolonged mitosis and has been implicated as a regulator of
apoptosis following exposure to antimitotic therapeutics
(10, 11). Depletion of CASC1 or TRIM69 leads to a reduction
in MCL-1 levels in a paclitaxel-dependent manner whereas
PDE3B inhibition led to a reduction in MCL-1 even in the
absence of paclitaxel. Consistent with previous reports indicating that MCL-1 is degraded by residual APC/C activity
during mitosis, siANAPC5 did not decrease MCL-1 levels
(Fig. 2E; ref. 10). Cell death despite MCL-1 stabilization in

www.aacrjournals.org

ANAPC5-depleted cells indicates existence of MCL-1–independent apoptotic mechanisms. Taken together, these ﬁndings
suggest that enhancing mitotic arrest by 20% to 50% in the presence of paclitaxel can be sufﬁcient to engage a programmed
cell death response in chemoresistant NSCLC.
Inhibition of APC/C is synthetic lethal with paclitaxel in
chemorefractory NSCLC
Findings thus far indicate that, in principle, prolonging
mitotic arrest by inhibiting the APC/C may be a therapeutic
strategy to restore paclitaxel sensitivity in NSCLC. Importantly,
suppression of ANAPC5 in nontumorigenic cells (HBEC3KT)
did not enhance the impact of paclitaxel, suggesting that tumor
cells may have an enhanced sensitivity to APC/C inhibition
(Fig. 2F). The difference in response is unlikely because of cellcycle kinetics as the HBEC3KT and HCC366 cells proliferate at
approximately the same rate (Supplementary Fig. S3C).
Together these data suggest that this combinatorial approach
may exhibit a therapeutic window. Indeed, combining a sublethal dose of the APC/C inhibitor, proTAME, with paclitaxel in
HCC366 cells enhanced the accumulation of mitotic cells and
induced cleaved caspase-3/-7 above levels detected for either
agent alone (Fig. 2G and Supplementary Fig. S3D; ref. 14).
To further examine molecular mechanisms that contribute
to the duration of mitotic arrest, we focused on CASC1 and
TRIM69, whose inhibition displayed minimal, if any, singleagent activity, but which collaborated with paclitaxel to both
increase mitotic transit time and reduce MCL-1 levels.
CASC1 regulates microtubule function
Although limited information is available on the function of
human CASC1, a polymorphism in the murine Casc1 gene at
codon 60 [AGT (Ser) ! AAT (Asp)] is associated with susceptibility to urethane-induced lung carcinogenesis in mouse
models (15, 16). The signiﬁcance of these polymorphisms has
not been realized in human cancer as none of the 5 human
CASC1 isoforms harbor Asn or Ser at residue 60, and other
polymorphisms in CASC1 have not been linked to NSCLC
susceptibility or progression (17). However, TCGA analysis
revealed an ampliﬁcation of CASC1 in 15%, 11%, and 7% of
lung (adenoma and squamous), ovarian, and breast tumors,
respectively (Supplementary Fig. S4A; 18). This ampliﬁcation
typically co-occurs with KRAS, which is adjacent to CASC1 on
chromosome 12. Although the function of human CASC1 has
not been documented, returning this gene as a top paclitaxel
sensitizer in a genome-wide screen implies it may have essential roles in supporting cell division. We assessed the consequences of CASC1 depletion alone and in the presence of an
otherwise innocuous dose of paclitaxel in a panel of NSCLC
lines with differing paclitaxel sensitivity. In resistant cell lines,
where we detected mitotic arrest phenotypes, we found a
dependence on CASC1 for viability alone or in the presence
of paclitaxel (Fig. 3A). In addition, siCASC1 is monogenic lethal
or synthetic lethal with paclitaxel in 5 additional NSCLC cell
lines, a defect we did not observe in an immortalized human
bronchial epithelial (HBEC3KT) cell line (Fig. 3A). Thus, CASC1
seems to be essential in both resistant and sensitive tumor
settings, indicating that tumor cells develop a dependence on

Sinnott et al.

H1155 cells indicated that depletion of CASC1 prolonged mitotic arrest, which resolved as either aberrant mitotic exit or cell
death in the presence of paclitaxel (Supplementary Fig. S4C).
Previous reports indicate that murine and chlamydomonas
CASC1 (IC97) orthologues can bind microtubules (15, 19).
Given that human and mouse CASC1 proteins are 66.7%
identical and 92% identical in the microtubule binding region,
we reasoned that the mitotic defects observed following CASC1
depletion could be because of a microtubule defect. We examined the microtubule network in H1299 cells, where siCASC1
alone had a potent impact on mitotic spindle formation and cell
viability. siCASC1 diminished the polymerized tubulin network
in interphase cells and attenuated microtubule regrowth after
nocodazole washout (Fig. 3C and D). Recently, SAC signaling
has been correlated with levels of unattached kinetochores.
Thus, increasing the number of unattached kinetochores only
slightly could prolong mitotic arrest (20–22). An increase of
BUBR1 positive kinetochores in HCC366 cells exposed to
paclitaxel and depleted of CASC1 suggest that CASC1 may be
supporting mitotic slippage by promoting microtubule–kinetochore attachments and reducing SAC strength (Fig. 3E).
We further examined the impact of siCASC1 on microtubules in HBEC3KT alone, or following stable depletion of
p53 in the absence (HBEC3KT-p53) and presence of oncogenic K-RAS (HBEC3KT-p53RASV12; ref. 23). Here, we found
that CASC1 was essential for microtubule polymerization in
all settings, but only essential for viability following depletion
of p53, thus suggesting the tumor-speciﬁc dependency on
CASC1 for viability can be driven by a loss of tumor suppressor activity (Supplementary Fig. S4D and S4E). Taken
together, these ﬁndings suggest that combinatorial regimens
that incorporate multiple antitubulin agents may enhance or
restore sensitivity to NSCLC.
TRIM69 is a centrosomal and microtubule-associated
protein essential for mitotic spindle formation
TRIM69 is a member of the TRIpartite Motif (TRIM)
containing protein family, which contains a RING E3 ligase
domain, B box, and coiled coil domains (24). Two isoforms
exist, A and B, with only the TRIM69A isoform containing a
RING domain (Supplementary Fig. S5A). Indicative that
TRIM69A is an E3 ligase, we detected autoubiquitination of
TRIM69A in an in vitro ubiquitination assay (Supplementary
Fig. S5B). We found that TRIM69 depletion, similar to CASC1,
activated cell death signaling alone or in the presence of
paclitaxel in multiple sensitive and resistant NSCLC backgrounds, with the exception of H2887. This defect was not
observed in normal HBEC3KT cells (Fig. 4A), thus implicating
a dependency on TRIM69 for tumor cell survival. At the single
cell level, we observed a number of mitotic defects, including
(i) micronucleation (A549), (ii) paclitaxel-enhanced micronucleation (H1299), and (iii) multipolar spindles in the
presence of paclitaxel (HCC366 and H1299; Fig. 4B and
Supplementary Fig. S5C). Depletion of TRIM69 also increased
BUBR1 occupancy at kinetochores in paclitaxel-treated
HCC366 cells (Fig. 4C). Thus, we conclude that TRIM69 is
essential for mitotic ﬁdelity and may be essential for the
proper attachment of microtubules to kinetochores.

3864

Cancer Res; 74(14) July 15, 2014

To further elucidate the mitotic function of TRIM69, we
examined the localization of both isoforms of TRIM69 during
the cell cycle. Examination of cells overexpressing mycTRIM69A revealed localization to microtubules during interphase and centrosomes during mitosis (Fig. 5A). Overexpressed myc-TRIM69A also induced microtubule bundling,
rendering microtubules resistant to nocodazole and leading
to the generation of micronucleated cells (Fig. 5A and Supplementary Fig. S5D). The localization of myc-TRIM69A to
microtubules and centrosomes was dependent upon an intact
RING domain as mutation of canonical cysteines in the zinc
ﬁnger of TRIM69A abrogated microtubule and centrosomal
localization of the overexpressed construct, indicating that the
localization of TRIM69A is dependent upon E3-ligase activity
and/or interaction partners (Fig. 5A). Consistent with this
ﬁnding, myc-TRIM69B, which lacks the RING domain, was
dispersed throughout the cytoplasm during the cell cycle and
did not display microtubule localization or induce alterations
in microtubule stability (Fig. 5A and Supplementary Fig. S5D).
These data suggest that TRIM69 may play a critical role in
supporting mitotic ﬁdelity.
We next studied the dynamics of myc-TRIM69A localization
during the cell cycle, using H1299 cells with stable expression of
myc-TRIM69A. In this setting, we found that myc-TRIM69A is
recruited to centrosomes during prometaphase where it
remains through telophase (Fig. 5B and Supplementary Fig.
S5E). myc-TRIM69A also associated with endogenous pericentrin in cells arrested in mitosis (Supplementary Fig. S5F). The
centrosomal localization of TRIM69A was further bolstered by
proteomics datasets that indicate interactions between
TRIM69 and a number of mitotic proteins, including centrosomal and cytoskeletal components (Supplementary Fig. 5G;
refs. 25–36). Indeed, depletion of 2 centrosomal proteins that
putatively interact with TRIM69, MYPT1, and GNAI3, attenuate centrosomal localization of myc-TRIM69A during mitosis
(Fig. 5C).
Tumor cells frequently amplify centrosomes, which can be
induced by tumor suppressors and/or oncogenes. As multiple
centrosomes can lead to multipolar mitosis, mitotic defects,
and cell death, tumor cells depend upon mechanisms that
promote centrosomal clustering for cell survival (37). Proteomic studies suggest that TRIM69 interacts with the 8-member
Augmin complex (also known as HAUS), which is essential for
centrosomal clustering (31, 37). To evaluate a functional
interaction between TRIM69 and the HAUS complex, we
depleted HAUS1 in H1299 cells in the presence and absence
of myc-TRIM69A. We ﬁnd that spindle multipolarity induced
by inhibition of HAUS1 can be reversed by overexpression of
myc-TRIM69A, indicating that TRIM69A can promote centrosomal clustering (Fig. 5D). Thus, inhibition of TRIM69A may
enhance the vulnerability of tumor cells to paclitaxel by
attenuating centrosome clustering, which may prolong mitotic
arrest and allow for the reengagement of cell death signaling.
CASC1 and TRIM69 are required for in vivo tumor growth
We next determined whether CASC1 and TRIM69 were
essential for growth of tumors in vivo. Speciﬁcally, to achieve
stable depletion of CASC1 and TRIM69, we introduced shRNAs

These cells were subcutaneously injected into immunodeﬁcient mice, and we observed attenuation in growth of tumors
expressing shTRIM69 and shCASC1 (Fig. 6B and C), indicating
that the depletion of CASC1 or TRIM69 in vivo was sufﬁcient to
reduce mitotic ﬁdelity, hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining
on excised tumors revealed extensive micronucleation, and
aberrant mitotic ﬁgures (Fig. 6D). Furthermore, TUNEL staining on tissue sections revealed enhanced cell death (Fig. 6E).
Taken together, these ﬁndings indicate that CASC1 and
TRIM69 suppression is sufﬁcient to affect mitotic ﬁdelity and
viability in vivo.

Discussion
Although genomic studies have begun to isolate cohorts of
patients that may be selectively sensitive to precision therapeutics, the majority of patients with NSCLC are administered
standard chemotherapeutic regimens that are comprised of
DNA damage agents and antimitotics. These regimens are
noncurative and in 70% of cases fail to reduce tumor burden
(2, 3). The underlying basis for the intrinsic resistance of

NSCLC to standard chemotherapy is poorly understood. Here,
we use a genome-wide RNAi approach to deﬁne the molecular
components that deﬂect cell death in the presence of mitotic
damage. This work resulted in a number of new principles
about chemoresistance and mitosis in tumor cells. First, a
common feature to uncouple tumor cell death from an insurmountable spindle defect is mitotic slippage. Second, inhibition of speciﬁc proteins can increase mitotic transit time >20%,
which is sufﬁcient to activate cell death. Third, CASC1 is a novel
regulator of microtubule dynamics that is essential for tumor,
but not normal cell survival. Fourth, TRIM69 is a novel mitotic
centrosomal resident protein that supports centrosomal clustering. In contrast to a previous screen in H1155 sensitive cells,
we did not return multiple components of the gTURC or
kinetochore complexes, suggesting that perturbing spindle
assembly in general is not sufﬁcient to enhance sensitivity in
NSCLC cells resistant to paclitaxel (12). These ﬁndings suggest
a new therapeutic strategy for chemoresistant NSCLC: combining antimitotic agents, such as paclitaxel, with agents, such
as small molecule inhibitors of the APC/C may enhance the
potency of these ﬁrst-line agents with limited impacts on
normal tissues.

Many tumor cells exhibit a brief SAC-dependent arrest and
mitotic escape following exposure to spindle poisons in vitro
and in vivo (6, 38). The frequency of this behavior suggests that
tumor evolution may generally select for variants that are
capable of bypassing prolonged mitotic arrest. Oncogenic
changes such as p53 loss, EGFR activation, or K-RAS mutation

3866

Cancer Res; 74(14) July 15, 2014

can induce mitotic spindle and centrosomal alterations, which
could conceivably disrupt mitotic progression and lead to cell
death in pre-tumorigenic lesions (39–41). Thus, those preneoplastic variants that bypass mitotic arrest could have a selective advantage, if they retain fecundity. A collateral consequence of this relationship would be an intrinsic resistance to

antimitotic chemotherapeutics. Our work supports the
hypothesis that re-engaging a prolonged mitotic arrest can
enhance sensitivity to antimitotics (6, 9). We ﬁnd that elevation
of mitotic transit time by 20% to 50% is sufﬁcient to switch a
paclitaxel-resistant setting to a sensitive one. However, frank
inhibition of the APC/C, through depletion of CDC20, is highly
lethal in tumor cells and likely normal cells, given the requirement for CDC20 to activate the APC/C (9). Thus, single agent
targeting of the APC/C could have a narrow or nonexistent
therapeutic window. Our ﬁnding that ANAPC5 depletion can
exhibit a synthetic lethal interaction with paclitaxel, suggests
that tumor cells may have an enhanced sensitivity to APC/C
inhibition that may be exploited by combining sublethal

www.aacrjournals.org

inhibition of APC/C with low-dose paclitaxel to produce a
synthetic phenotype.
We also deﬁne a mitotic and microtubule role for the human
CASC1 protein in tumor cells. Although this gene has been
linked with murine lung tumorigenesis, any functional role in
human tumorigenesis has not been demonstrated. We ﬁnd
that tumor cells require CASC1 for microtubule polymerization and inhibition of CASC1 potentially impacts microtubule
availability for the alignment of chromosomes, thereby
increasing the number of unattached kinetochores and
prolonging the SAC. The heightened dependency on tubulin
regulation in tumor cells could be driven by oncogenic stress
that may increase centrosomal clustering defects and

attachment errors, thus creating an environment in which mild
disruptions to the microtubule network can wreak havoc on
chromosome segregation in tumor cells. As a recent report
suggest that mitosis is compromised in K-RAS backgrounds,
the genetic link between CASC1 and K-RAS may allow for
mitigation of transformation induced mitotic defects by
increasing the expression of a microtubule regulatory protein in concert with an oncogene (40). Importantly, these
ﬁndings suggest that one mechanism for prolonging the SAC
in tumor cells may be to compromise microtubule function
in parallel, but independent, manners by combining antitubulin agents.
TRIM69A is an E3 ligase with only limited characterized
function, which we implicate as critical for mitotic ﬁdelity.
Speciﬁcally, TRIM69A seems to promote centrosomal clustering, which is an essential process to prevent multipolar spindles and decreased mitotic ﬁdelity (37, 42, 43). Thus, interfering
with centrosomal clustering may be a route to sensitize
resistance cells to paclitaxel. Furthermore, the dependency of
TRIM69 on MYPT1 and GNAI3 for centrosomal localization
implicates TRIM69 in the regulation of phosphatase and
receptor-independent G(ialpha) signaling during mitosis.
MYPT1, which is localized to the spindle, kinetochores and
centrosomes, is thought to regulate SAC checkpoint silencing
though dephosphorylation of Aurora B and BUB1 (44–46).
GNAI3 and other G(ialpha) subunits have been localized to
the centrosome and depletion of GNAI3 induces cytokinesis
defects, whereas overexpression increases mitotic transit time
(47). Thus, TRIM69A activity may be essential for coordinating
multiple molecular events that promote bipolar spindle formation and allow for rapid checkpoint silencing. Investigation
into the role of TRIM69A regulation may reveal additional

mechanisms governing spindle alignment and centrosome
clustering.
