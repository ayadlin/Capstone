ABSTRACT
Objective: The incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) is increasing,
but factors contributing to malignant progression of its precursor lesion, Barrett’s
esophagus (BE), have not been defined. Hypergastrinemia caused by long-term use
of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), has been suggested as one possible risk factor. The
gastrin receptor, CCK2R, is expressed in the cardia and upregulated in BE, suggesting
the involvement of the gastrin-CCK2R pathway in progression. In the L2-IL-1β mouse
model, Barrett’s-like esophagus arises from the gastric cardia. Therefore, we aimed to
analyze the effect of hypergastrinemia on CCK2R+ progenitor cells in L2-IL-1β mice.
Design: L2-IL-1β mice were mated with hypergastrinemic (INS-GAS) mice or
treated with PPIs to examine the effect of hypergastrinemia in BE progression. CCK2RCreERT crossed with L2-IL-1β mice were used to analyze the lineage progenitor
potential of CCK2R+ cells. Cardia glands were cultured in vitro, and the effect of
gastrin treatment analyzed. L2-IL-1β mice were treated with a CCK2R antagonist
YF476 as a potential chemopreventive drug.
Results: Hypergastrinemia resulted in increased proliferation and expansion of
Barrett’s-like esophagus. Lineage tracing experiments revealed that CCK2R+ cells are
long-lived progenitors that can give rise to such lesions under chronic inflammation.
Gastrin stimulated organoid growth in cardia culture, while CCK2R inhibition prevented
Barrett’s-like esophagus and dysplasia.
Conclusions: Our data suggest a progression model for BE to EAC in which
CCK2R+ progenitor cells, stimulated by hypergastrinemia, proliferate to give rise to
metaplasia and dysplasia. Hypergastrinemia can result from PPI use, and the effects
of hypergastrinemia in human BE should be studied further.

INTRODUCTION

The L2-IL-1β transgenic mouse model develops
Barrett’s-like metaplasia in response to constitutive
expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1β in
the squamous mucosa of the esophagus and forestomach
[20]. Mouse and human anatomy differ in that squamous
mucosa in mouse stomach extends partway into the
anatomical stomach; however metaplasia and dysplasia
develop at the gastroesophageal junction in humans and
the L2-IL-1β mice develop a similar phenotype at the
squamocolumnar junction, with changes throughout the
junction between the forestomach/esophagus and the
columnar stomach. In this model, gastric progenitors
migrate from below the squamocolumnar junction (SCJ)
proximally into the esophagus, giving rise to columnar and
mucus (similar to intestinal) metaplasia. Inducible lineage
tracing has demonstrated that Barrett’s-like lesions in
L2-IL-1β mice can arise from Lgr5+ cells in the cardia,
although other progenitor markers including CCK2R,
were also upregulated in the cardia [20]. Thus, while
cardia glands may be structurally similar to antral glands
and express CCK2R, the precise role or expression pattern
of CCK2R in the cardia and Barrett’s esophagus has not
been defined.

The incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC)
has risen 6-fold in the U.S. since the 1970s [1, 2]. Major
risk factors for EAC include male gender, obesity, and a
history of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), but
Barrett’s esophagus (BE) increases the risk of EAC by
11-fold [3–5]. In BE, present in up to 1.6% of unselected
populations, the normal squamous epithelium of the lower
esophagus is replaced by columnar epithelium. However,
the risk of EAC in patients with nondysplastic BE is quite
low (0.12% annually) [6]. Screening for dysplasia in BE
patients has not been shown to decrease mortality [7, 8].
Thus, a better understanding is needed of the factors
involved in neoplastic progression of BE.
Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) have been used
routinely over the last several decades to treat BE patients,
but their impact on progression of BE remains unresolved.
PPIs ameliorate reflux symptoms and promote healing of
esophagitis in most patients over the short term [9], and
most studies suggest they reduce BE progression. However,
PPIs cause both acid suppression and a physiologic
secondary hypergastrinemia, which can lead to extremely
high plasma gastrin levels in some patients [10, 11]. In
one study that stratified PPI-treated BE patients by gastrin
levels, the highest quartile of gastrin levels was associated
with an increased risk of high-grade dysplasia or EAC on
biopsy [12]. However, the effect of hypergastrinemia and
overactive downstream signaling in BE and EAC has not
yet been demonstrated in experimental models.
The effects of gastrin are mediated by the CCK2R
(also known as CCKBR), a G-protein coupled receptor
expressed in the central nervous system and throughout
the gastrointestinal tract [13]. In the gastric corpus of the
proximal stomach, the receptor mediates acid secretion
as well as growth and differentiation of the epithelium.
[13–15] CCK2R is upregulated in the mucosa during ulcer
healing, and inhibition impairs mucosal regeneration.
[16, 17] While CCK2R might in theory mark a shortlived progenitor cell that expands during healing, we have
recently shown that CCK2R marks a +4 gastric antrum
progenitor, which is Lgr5neg or low and lineage traces entire
antral glands [18]. These CCK2R+ progenitors in the
gastric antrum can undergo interconversion to Lgr5+ cells
and contribute to gastric cancer development. However,
the role of CCK2R in the gastric cardia and BE has not
been clarified.
CCK2R is upregulated 2-fold in human BE tissues,
and mediates gastrin-induced proliferation and antiapoptotic effects in primary cultures of BE biopsies [19].
In addition, CCK2R is upregulated in the gastric cardia of
mice with Barrett’s metaplasia, and this effect is enhanced
with administration of bile acids [20]. Studies in animal
models of gastrointestinal cancer have demonstrated that
CCK2R signaling can accelerate tumorigenesis in vivo, such
as in gastrin-overexpressing INS-GAS mice that develop
proximal gastric cancers [21].

RESULTS
Hypergastrinemia accelerates the development
of Barrett’s-like metaplasia in mice
In order to test the effect of PPI treatment and
subsequent hypergastrinemia on development and
progression of Barrett’s-like esophagus, bile acid-treated
WT and L2-IL-1β mice were given omeprazole for three
months (Figure 1A). Omeprazole treatment increased
plasma gastrin levels compared to untreated controls,
as seen in human patients (Figure 1B). As reported
previously, bile acid treatment induced hyperplastic
mucosa extending proximal to the SCJ. Omeprazole
treatment accelerated metaplastic and dysplastic changes,
leading to increased mitotic figures, loss of cell polarity,
and hyperchromatic nuclei (Figure 1C). Omeprazoletreated mice had higher dysplasia scores and a reduced
percentage of mucus producing cells compared to
untreated mice (Figure 1C–1E). Barrett’s-like esophagus
with increased dysplasia has lower levels of mucus cell
differentiation, with fewer cells resembling the goblet
cells in human BE, and thus the G/C ratio (goblet-like
cell/columnar cell) quantifies this lesser degree of cellular
differentiation.
While PPIs strongly suppress acid secretion,
leading to numerous changes in gastric physiology,
we hypothesized that PPI-related hypergastrinemia
was primarily responsible for the acceleration of BE
in mice. To address the role of genetically-induced
hypergastrinemia on the progression of BE, we crossed
INS-GAS mice, overexpressing amidated gastrin under

the transcriptional control of the rat insulin promoter
[22], with L2-IL-1β mice. Plasma gastrin levels were
significantly higher in L2-IL-1β/INS-GAS mice compared
to L2-IL-1β mice (Figure 1F). Hypergastrinemia alone
was not sufficient to induce metaplastic or dysplastic
cells at the SCJ of INS-GAS mice, whereas the addition
of hypergastrinemia to the chronic inflammation/BE
phenotype led to a marked expansion of Barrett’s-like
esophagus in L2-IL-1β/INS-GAS mice compared to
L2-IL-1β mice (Figure 1G). This expanded BE occurred in
a region where we previously did not observe metaplasia or
dysplasia in INS-GAS mice [22]. Mucus cell differentiation
was reduced in L2-IL-1β/INS-GAS mice compared to
L2-IL-1β mice, suggesting that hypergastrinemia inhibits
the intestinal differentiation typically seen in BE patients.
We have previously shown that inhibition of Notch
signaling through a gamma-secretase inhibitor (GSI) can
inhibit proliferation and induce more classical intestinal
differentiation in the L2-IL-1β mouse model [20]; this was
also true for IL-1β/INS-GAS mice, where GSI-treatment
led to a marked increase in Muc-2 and Alcian bluepositive metaplastic cells in the mouse cardia (Figure S2),
consistent with an intestinally differentiated Barrett’s-like
phenotype. CD44, a potential progenitor cell marker, is
normally expressed in undifferentiated cells near the base
of cardia glands, and is also found in gastric dysplasia
and cancer. In our model, CD44+ cells were expanded in
L2-IL-1β mice, with a further increase in CD44+ cells
in L2-IL-1β/INS-GAS mice (Figure 1H), supporting the
notion that hypergastrinemia promotes the development of
a less differentiated, hyperproliferative type of Barrett’slike esophagus, with a low G/C ratio.

upregulated in hypergastrinemic mouse cardia, along with
CCK2R (Figure 2E).
We next stained various human biopsy samples for
CCK2R by in situ hybridization. Similar to the mouse
stomach, the normal human cardia contains CCK2R+
cells near the base of the glands (Figure 2F). The numbers
of CCK2R+ cells in human BE, relative to the gastric
cardia, are increased with either incomplete and complete
intestinal metaplasia, and further evident in esophageal
adenocarcinoma arising from BE (Figure 2G–2H).
These results suggest that CCK2R+ cells can expand
in cardia glands during BE progression in response to
hypergastrinemia.

CCK2R marks long-lived progenitors in cardia
and gives rise to Barrett’s-like metaplasia
We then sought to understand the role of CCK2R+
cells in the cardia of wild type mice and in Barrett-s
like esophagus in L2-IL-1β mice. We hypothesized that
CCK2R+ cells might act as progenitors in the cardia
(as previously demonstrated in the gastric antrum [23])
and analyzed the cell fate of CCK2R+ cells in mice.
We utilized CCK2R-CreERT; R26-TdTomato mice
[23] and examined lineage tracing of CCK2R+ cells by
administering tamoxifen at 6 weeks of age. Similar to
CCK2R staining, rare recombined cells were visible
near the base of the cardia 24 hours after induction
(Figure 3A). By days 7 and 30, these Tomato-red cells
expanded and moved upward in the cardia gland until
almost all the cells in the gland were labeled. Tomatored cells persisted for up to one year, showing that
CCK2R+ cells are long-lived gastric progenitors in
cardia (Figure 3A). Similar tracing events were observed
when another Rosa26 reporter line CCK2R-CreERT;
Rosa26rmTmG mice were used (Figure S3). Another
mouse line expressing constitutive Cre-recombinase
under the CCK2R promoter also confirmed the expression
in cardia progenitors (Figure 3B). We isolated and
cultured cardia glands from CCK2R-CreERT/R26-mTmG
mice after tamoxifen induction and observed that CCK2R+
cells rapidly expanded and lineage traced cultured cardia
organoids (Figure 3C), indicating that these cells represent
progenitor cells with lineage tracing capability.
To determine whether Barrett’s-like esophagus
arises from CCK2R+cells in the cardia, we crossed
L2-IL-1β to CCK2R-CreERT/R26-TdTomato mice. In these
mice, TdTomato expression was present in cardia 24 hours
after tamoxifen induction, and within a few weeks
expanded to entire BE glands. In bile-acid treated L2-IL1β/CCK2R-CreERT/R26-TdTomato mice, CCK2R+ cells
expanded towards the squamocolumnar junction within
90 days (Figure 3D). At one year, the lineage-traced
lesions in the cardia of L2-IL-1β mice were CK20-positive
and p63-negative metaplasia (Figure 3E). These results
suggest that CCK2R+ progenitors from the cardia can

Gastrin-dependent expansion of CCK2R+ cells
in Barrett’s-like metaplasia
Since Barrett’s-like esophagus appeared to be
accelerated by hypergastrinemia, we examined the
expression of the gastrin receptor (CCK2R) in epithelial
cells in the mouse cardia and in human BE. First we
examined CCK2R expression in wild type mouse gastric
cardia by immunohistochemistry, which showed rare
cells in the cardia glands (Figure 2A). Examination of the
L2-IL-1β mouse cardia showed some expansion of
CCK2R+ cells in the inflamed cardia (Figure 2A, 2B).
To further test the effect of gastrin in these CCK2R+
cells, WT and L2-IL-1β mice were infused with gastrin
(5 ug/kg/h/day) and/or a CCK2R antagonist YF476 for
7 days. While gastrin treatment had a minimal effect on
the number of CCK2R+ cells in WT mice, the number of
CCK2R+ cells in L2-IL-1β mice was increased by gastrin
infusion (Figure 2A, 2B). Epithelial proliferation in the
gastric cardia as measured by Ki67 immunostaining was
increased by gastrin infusion, and blocked by simultaneous
YF476 administration (Figure 2C, 2D). Interestingly, the
expression of cardia stem cell marker Lgr5 was markedly

give rise to Barrett-s like esophagus in response to chronic
inflammation.
In previous studies we showed that LGR5 is
upregulated in biopsies of human BE, and Lgr5+ stem
cells can lineage trace the cardia and BE lesions in
L2-IL-1β mice. Since both Lgr5 and CCK2R mark cardia
progenitor cells, we tested whether there is any overlap
between Lgr5+ and CCK2R+ cells in the cardia gland. We
stained Lgr5-DTR-GFP mouse stomach for CCK2R, and
confirmed that the majority of CCK2R+ cells in the cardia
(approximately 85%) are Lgr5-negative (Figure 3F).
Thus, these represent two distinct stem cell pools that
can lineage trace the cardia gland. We next generated
CCK2R-CreERT/Lgr5-DTR-GFP/R26-TdTomato mice,
and administered tamoxifen. At early time points,
there were no recombined red cells in the Lgr5+ green
population; however, CCK2R+ stem cells gave rise to

Lgr5+ cells at the base after 30 days (Figure 3G). A similar
expression pattern for Lgr5 and CCK2R lineages was
demonstrated by in situ hybridization in CCK2R-CreERT/
R26-TdTomato mice (Figure S4), suggesting the presence
of interconversion between these two initially distinct
populations.

Amidated gastrin promotes cardia organoid
growth through CCK2R
In order to confirm that gastrin can promote
progression of Barrett’s-like esophagus in a direct manner
by inducing proliferation in CCK2R+ cells, we studied
cardia organoids from L2-IL-1β and WT mice. Organoids
grown from the L2-IL-1β mouse cardia increased in
number in response to gastrin in a dose-dependent manner
(Figure 4A–4B). There was no increase in organoid size

with gastrin treatment (Figure 4C). The effect of gastrin
on the number of L2-IL-1β cardia organoids was blocked
by YF476, highlighting the specificity of gastrin/CCK2R
signaling on organoid expansion. The expression of Cck2r
and Lgr5 was significantly increased in gastrin-treated
organoids in a dose-dependent manner compared to
untreated organoids (Figure 4D), suggesting that amidated
gastrin activates and expands the cardia progenitor
compartment.

Importantly, hypergastrinemia enhanced the
development of dysplasia within Barrett’s-like esophagus,
particularly in MNU-treated animals. These findings are
consistent with some human data, where BE patients
with the highest gastrin levels were more likely to have a
history of high-grade dysplasia or EAC [12]. It is possible
that indirect effects of gastrin or PPIs could have had this
effect. Hypergastrinemia is also known to induce acid
secretion, which by itself could in theory have caused an
accelerated phenotype in the INS-GAS mice. However,
mice do not develop reflux esophagitis, and we have in
the past excluded such a mechanism, since acidified water
in the L2-IL-1β mouse model did not increase metaplasia
and dysplasia [20]. Moreover, the fact that PPI treatment
produced a similar phenotype to gastrin overexpression
(in INS-GAS/L2-IL-1β mice) does point to the likelihood
of direct effects of gastrin. Our data raises the possibility
that hypergastrinemic states may worsen BE in patients
with preexisting esophageal inflammation through
providing a more carcinogenic niche that enables
increased proliferation and less differentiation.
Most epidemiologic studies suggest that PPIs reduce
the risk of progression from BE to HGD or EAC, although
there are no randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials
demonstrating that PPIs have chemopreventive effects. The
effect of PPIs on G/C ratio in BE patients has not been
analyzed to our knowledge. A recent meta-analysis reported
that PPI use in BE was associated with a significant
reduction in the risk of progression to HGD or EAC
(OR 0.29) [24]. However, 95–98% of all identified BE
patients are treated with PPIs, and as such prior studies
have lacked well-matched control groups. [24–26]
Additionally, there has been some inconsistency with
regard to the effects of PPI use on progression. In a nested
case-control study using a Veterans’ Affairs database, PPI
use was not associated with a reduced risk of EAC after
adjusting for NSAID and statin use and other potential
confounders [26]. Case-control studies from the UK and
from Denmark have reported an increased risk of EAC in
BE patients on PPIs [27, 28]. Importantly, few of the studies
to date have accounted for gastrin levels in assessing the
effects of PPIs on the risk of progression in BE. In a crosssectional study of BE patients on PPIs by Wang et al,
those with the highest gastrin levels were significantly
more likely to have a history of HGD or EAC [12]. If
hypergastrinemia can contribute to carcinogenesis in BE,
this has implications for continuing PPIs in patients who
develop high gastrin levels on treatment.
However, PPIs have significant benefits in
human BE, and omeprazole might worsen Barrett’slike esophagus in mice more so than in humans. Unlike
humans, mice do not have acid reflux, which may promote
proliferation and dysplasia [29], and which is reduced
by PPIs [30, 31]. In humans, omeprazole decreases
acid secretion and reduces duodenogastric reflux [32].

Blockade of CCK2R prevents the development
of Barrett’s-like metaplasia in mice
To investigate whether gastrin blockade prevents the
progression and proliferation of Barrett's-like esophagus
cells, we treated L2-IL-1β mice with YF476 (Figure 5A) at
6 months of age, when the first Barrett’s-like changes are
observed at the SCJ. Mice were sacrificed at 15 months of
age. CCK2R blockade increased systemic levels of gastrin in
a compensatory manner (not shown). Nevertheless, YF476
treatment led to a decrease in the dysplasia score, increased
differentiated goblet-like cell to columnar cell (G/C) ratio,
and decreased Ki67 index in cardia (Figure 5B–5E).
L2-IL-1β mice treated with bile acids and MNU
develop dysplastic lesions at an earlier age than mice
treated with bile acids alone, and thus MNU/bile acidtreated L2-IL-1β mice were also treated with YF476 or
vehicle (Figure 5F). YF476 prevented the development
of advanced dysplasia and markedly increased the mucus
cell (G/C) ratio compared to controls (Figure 5G–5I).
Furthermore, when L2-IL-1β/INS-GAS mice were treated
with YF476, the dysplasia score in L2-IL-1β/INS-GAS
mice was decreased and the mucus cell (G/C) ratio
increased, indicating a strict dependence on CCK2R
activation in these mouse phenotypes (Figure 5J, 5K).

DISCUSSION
We demonstrate here that PPI-induced or genetic
hypergastrinemia can increase the Barrett’s-like metaplasia
phenotype in our L2-IL-1β mouse model, and that this can
lead to accelerated progression to dysplasia. Blocking
CCK2R with a small molecule inhibitor (YF476) in
L2-IL-1β mice inhibited this effect. We have further
shown that CCK2R, which is upregulated in human BE
tissue, marks a long-lived gastric cardia progenitor cell
that expands in the setting of chronic inflammation and
hypergastrinemia and gives rise to Barrett’s-like esophagus
in the L2-IL-1β mouse model. Hypergastrinemia could
stimulate CCK2R+ cells in BE tissue to proliferate,
and increased proliferation is correlated with less
differentiation, less mucus (goblet-like) cell metaplasia in
BE areas, and with accelerated malignant transformation.
These findings suggest that elevated serum gastrin levels
in BE patients warrants further study.

In L2-IL-1β mice, however, the inflammatory esophagitis
is genetically induced and maintained not by GERD but
by the constitutive expression of IL-1β in the esophagus,
rendering the esophagitis refractory to PPI treatment.
Though this is a limitation of our model, L2-IL-1β mice
were treated with bile acid in the drinking water to
promote esophagitis, mimicking a mechanism by which
BE can be accelerated by PPIs, as hypergastrinemia
induces reduced gastric motility and therefore potentially
more bile acid reflux.

Hypergastrinemia in L2-IL-1β/INS-GAS mice led
to increased stem cell markers in the cardia. We [20]
and others [33] have previously demonstrated that Lgr5
marks a long-lived stem cell in the cardia that can become
activated in response to chronic inflammation. We show
here that CCK2R also marks a long-lived progenitor cell
in the cardia, similar to our earlier finding that CCK2R
marks progenitors in the gastric antrum [18]. Cardia
organoids from L2-IL-1β mice proliferate in response to
gastrin stimulation, suggesting a model in which CCK2R+

cells are “primed” by adjacent inflammation to proliferate
in response to gastrin. In addition to marking cardia
progenitor cells, CCK2R+ cells also gave rise to Barrett’slike metaplasia and dysplasia in L2-IL-1β mice. Thus,
CCK2R represents a second marker linking Barrett’s-like
metaplasia to its origin in the gastric cardia. CCK2R is not
expressed at appreciable levels in the small intestine, yet
numerous studies have now documented high levels of
expression in human BE [19, 34]. similar to the increased
cardia expression in our L2-IL-1β mice. Indeed, the finding
that CCK2R+ cells can give rise to Barrett’s-like esophagus
in mice is consistent with recent reports that human
Barrett’s glands have an organizational structure similar
to gastric glands, and probably start out within gastric
metaplasia prior to acquiring intestinal features [35].
The transition from a normal CCK2R+ progenitor to
a Barrett’s-like progenitor appeared to be largely driven by
chronic inflammation. In our model, expression of IL-1β
provided the necessary stimulus for SCJ inflammation that
led to upregulation of CCK2R. While we could not verify
whether IL-1β directly or indirectly induced CCK2R
expression in cardia cells, our data strongly suggest that
inflammation in the cardia due to the presence of IL-1β
increased the number of gastrin-responsive progenitor
cells. L2-IL-1β mice had a greater number of organoidforming progenitors in the gastric cardia compared to WT
mice, consistent with an expansion of potential progenitors
that could give rise to metaplasia and dysplasia.
The expression of the CCK2R in the cardia appears
to have functional significance. CCK2R expression is
increased in the gastric mucosa in response to cryoinjury
and other forms of gastric ulceration, where it contributes
to the regenerative response to injury [16]. Epithelial cell
proliferation during ulcer healing is inhibited by CCK2R
blockade and stimulated by omeprazole and exogenous
gastrin; however, CCK2R expression in this setting
is typically transient and quickly downregulated [17].
Gastrin stimulation appears to have the same proliferative
effect on Barrett’s epithelium, but in our model system this
phenomenon was more long lasting.
In conclusion, our data suggest that hypergastrinemia
promotes of progression and dysplasia in Barrett’s-like
esophagus in our mouse model. The limitations of this
mouse model warrants caution in extrapolating these
data to human BE. However these findings suggest that
in patients with BE, high gastrin levels warrant further
longitudinal study and consideration of either trials of
CCK2R inhibitors or more selective use of PPIs.

(0.2% deoxycholic acid, pH 7.0, Sigma, St. Louis, MO)
for the duration of the study. Omeprazole (Sigma, St.
Louis, MO) 200mg/kg/day was given intraperitoneally
5 times weekly in a 1:1 mixture of dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO) and PEG 300 at a concentration of 40mg/mL.
INS-GAS, CCK2R-CreERT, CCK2R-Cre, Lgr5-DTReGFP, Rosa26rLacZ, Rosa26rTdTom, and Rosa26rmTmG
mice have been previously described [23]. Tissues from
cardia were isolated as described in Figure S1. All murine
experiments were performed in compliance with federal
laws and institutional guidelines and approved by the
IACUC of the Columbia University Animal Care Facility
(protocol AAAF-2657).
In lineage tracing studies, tamoxifen 5 mg was given
by oral gavage. The gastrin receptor blocker, YF476 (kindly
provided by Dr. Keiji Miyata and Dr. Hidenobu Yuki,
Yamanouchi Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd., Tsukuba, Japan) was
dissolved in PEG-300 (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) at 12 mg/mL
(30 mg/kg) were given intraperitoneally twice weekly.
N-methyl-nitrosourea (MNU, Sigma, St. Louis, MO)
was administered at 240 ppm in the drinking water for
one week, followed by non-medicated water for one week,
repeated 5 times over a total of 10 weeks. After 10 weeks,
drinking water with bile acids was resumed.
