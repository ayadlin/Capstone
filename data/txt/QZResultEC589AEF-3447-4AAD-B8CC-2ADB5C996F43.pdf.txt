BACKGROUND: Meningioma is the most common extra-axial primary intracranial tumor in adults that rarely metastasizes outside of the central nervous system (CNS). Among recognized sites of metastases, the lung is the most common, but the importance of lung metastases relative to prognosis is unknown. 111Indium (111In)-octreotide scintigraphy
(octreotide scanning) is a valuable imaging modality with which to evaluate intracranial meningiomas and their
response to treatment with somatostatin analogues and has the potential to identify extracranial metastatic disease.
METHODS: In this retrospective multicenter study, adult patients treated for recurrent meningioma were identified.
These patients underwent 111In-octreotide positron emission tomography/computed tomography imaging (octreotide
scintigraphy) and were found to have positive octreotide uptake in their lungs. RESULTS: Six cases were identified
with recurrent meningioma (after surgery, radiotherapy, and at least 1 chemotherapy agent) and pulmonary lesions
by octreotide scintigraphy. Biopsy of a pulmonary lesion in 1 patient confirmed the diagnosis of metastatic meningioma. Patients with metastatic pulmonary involvement identified by 111In-octreotide scintigraphy in this case series
had an overall survival of 6 months, which is less than that reported from previously published series of patients with
unknown systemic disease status. CONCLUSIONS: 111In-octreotide scintigraphy is useful for assessing both CNS disease and extracranial metastases. The presence of pulmonary metastases appears to negatively affect survival in
patients with recurrent meningioma. The usefulness of 111In-octreotide scintigraphy should be considered in staging
patients with recurrent meningioma who are considered for further treatment. A prospective study to confirm this
finding is warranted. Cancer 2011;117:4506–11. Published 2011 by the American Cancer Society.*

Meningioma is the most common primary extra-axial tumor of the central nervous system (CNS) in adults,1-3 and arises
from the meningoepithelial cells of the leptomeninges.4 These tumors account for nearly one-third of all primary brain tumors.
On rare occasions, meningiomas can become anaplastic, with an overall rate of metastasis for all meningiomas of 1%. The most
common site of metastasis is the lung, which accounts for 61% of all meningioma metastases,2,5 followed by the liver, lymph
nodes, and bones.2,4,6 The diagnosis of metastatic meningioma can be challenging,2,7,8 and may require surgical intervention.
However, to our knowledge the prognostic implications of extracranial metastases have not been described to date.
Currently, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the most common imaging method used to detect and monitor intracranial meningiomas. Whole-body screening (using either MRI or computed tomography) could potentially detect systemic meningioma metastases, but these studies are less specific than 111indium (111In)-octreotide scintigraphy, and are
not routinely performed as part of metastatic surveys, even in cases of recurrent meningiomas that are refractory to surgery,
radiotherapy, and chemotherapy.
Among primary brain tumors, meningiomas have the highest frequency and density of somatostatin receptors
(SSTR).9 These receptors (of which 5 subtypes are recognized) are integral membrane proteins that share common

signaling pathways such as the inhibition of adenylyl cyclase, activation of phosphotyrosine phosphatase (PTP),
and modulation of mitogen-activated protein kinase
(MAPK) through G-protein–dependent mechanisms.10
SSTR subtypes 1, 2, 4, and 5 induce cell cycle arrest via
PTP-dependent modulation of MAPK, which is associated with induction of the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein and p21, and are responsible for the induction
of apoptosis in both normal and cancer cells.11
Octreotide is a synthetic derivative of somatostatin,
with preferential affinity for SSTR2 and SSTR5, and is
clinically used for the treatment of acromegaly and neuroendocrine tumors such as carcinoid.12 111Indium-labeled
octreotide brain scintigraphy can be used to differentiate
meningiomas from other dural-based pathology.5 Metastatic lesions often retain many of the primary tumor characteristics and thus 111In-octreotide scintigraphy has the
potential to detect extracranial meningioma metastases,
making scintigraphy a potentially useful, efficient, noninvasive diagnostic technique.5,13
A pilot study of sustained-release somatostatin (octreotide acetate) for the treatment of patients with refractory meningiomas (of all World Health Organization [WHO]
grades) indentified 3 of 16 (18.8%) patients with octreotidepositive pulmonary lesions.14 In the current study, 6 cases of
metastatic meningioma are presented in which pulmonary
meningioma metastases were detected after 111In-octreotide
scintigraphy and in 1 of the cases, meningioma histology was
confirmed by surgical resection and pathology analysis.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
We retrospectively identified 6 adult patients treated for
recurrent meningioma who were found to have positive
lung lesions after undergoing 111In-octreotide scintigraphy to evaluate their potential response to octreotide acetate therapy. In one of the patients, the pathology was
confirmed with biopsy and histopathologic analysis. We
sought to determine radiographic response (using the
modified criteria of Macdonald et al15) and the overall
survival (OS) of these patients from the time of the positive 111In-octreotide scintigraphy, and to compare their
survival with historical control data from similarly treated
patients reported in a recent prospective therapy trial.14

RESULTS
There were 6 patients, 3 of whom were women, with a
median age of 57 years (range, 26-84 years) (Table 1).
Four patients had multifocal brain lesions. Karnofsky performance status (KPS) ranged from 60 to 90 (median,
70). Initial treatment included surgery (Simpson grade I
and II resections in 4 patients and Simpson grade IV
resections in 2 patients) and radiotherapy (fractionated
external beam radiotherapy in 5 patients and stereotactic
radiotherapy in 1 patient). At the time of disease recurrence, patients were treated with reoperation (range, 1-4
surgeries; median, 2 surgeries), radiotherapy (fractionated
external beam radiotherapy in 1 patient and stereotactic
radiotherapy in 4 patients), and chemotherapy (hydroxyurea in 4 patients, temozolomide in 2 patients, and
PTK787 [a vascular endothelial growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor] in 2 patients) (Fig. 1, Table 1).
Subsequently and with radiographic documentation of
disease progression, all patients were treated with the sustained-release somatostatin analog octreotide acetate after
documentation of somatostatin receptor expression as
demonstrated by avid 111In-octreotide uptake.
All patients underwent whole-body 111In-octreotide
scintigraphy to evaluate both the intracranial and possible
systemic disease burden. The 111In-octreotide scintigraphy revealed uptake of radionuclide tracer in all intracranial meningiomas as well as demonstrated pulmonary
metastases (Fig. 2). For the 22 patients screened at the 2
institutions for which we have available data, we determined that 4 patients (18%) had octreotide-positive lung
lesions. One patient underwent thoracotomy and lobectomy and histopathology confirmed a metastatic anaplastic meningioma (Fig. 3).
Treatment with octreotide acetate (at a dose escalation regimen of 30 mg given intramuscularly initially followed 28 days later by a dose of 40 mg, increasing by 10
mg per treatment until a final dose of 60 mg was given every 4 weeks) in this very small patient population resulted
in mixed outcomes. Three patients demonstrated progressive disease at the time of their first MRI evaluation, 8
weeks after the initiation of the treatment.
We compared the results obtained from our small
study with previously published data on a very similar
cohort of patients with recurrent, treatment-resistant meningiomas who were being treated with octreotide

acetate.14 Age and KPS were found to be the most significant predictors of meningioma outcome.16 Compared
with these patients, the patients in the current study were
similar with regard to age (median age, 57 years vs 58
years in the previous study) and KPS (median, 70 vs 80 in
the previous study). The median duration of response for
the 6 patients in the current study was 2.0 months compared with previously published data that demonstrated a
median duration of response of 5.0 months.14 OS was
similarly poor: only 6.0 months from the time of treatment initiation (Fig. 4). Again, compared with otherwise
similarly treated patients, this was significantly worse (6
months vs 11 months; P ¼ .029).

DISCUSSION
Although meningiomas are 1 of the most common
tumors of the CNS, they are rarely histologically malignant (< 10%).17 However, a larger number of meningiomas (approximately 20%) exhibit aggressive behavior,
with approximately 1% of all patients with meningiomas
developing distant metastases.17-20 In contrast, > 90% of
anaplastic (WHO grade III)21 meningiomas exhibit aggressive behavior through local invasion and distant metastasis,
and approximately 75% of meningioma metastases are
associated with prior surgery.7 The most common site of
metastasis is the lung, comprising 61% of all meningioma
metastases.2 Despite this, a systemic workup for distant metastases is not usually included in the evaluation paradigm
for patients with high-risk recurrent meningioma.
Current management for recurrent meningioma
includes reoperation, radiotherapy, and stereotactic radiosurgery.2,14,22 However, in patients with histologically atypical
(WHO grade II) or anaplastic (WHO grade III) tumors,
these treatment approaches are almost never curative, with
10-year disease-free survival rates of 13% and 0%, respectively.14,22 In these patients, treatment with doxorubicin,
hydroxyurea, temozolomide, irinotecan, interferon-a, tamoxifen, imatinib, mifepristone, or octreotide acetate have
been attempted.14,22 One study reported that octreotide acetate was found to increase the progression-free survival rate at
6 months to 44% in patients with recurrent meningiomas
that expressed somatostatin receptors.14
Correlating the histologic features of meningiomas
with the potential for metastatic behavior has been an important topic of study because patient prognosis and
future treatment options depend critically on tumor
behavior. Many criteria have been used to define malignancy in meningioma. In general, rapid recurrence, local

invasion, atypical histological appearance, high mitotic
index, and extracranial metastasis are considered to be criteria that define aggressive meningiomas. Overall, atypical
and anaplastic meningiomas recur in > 30% of cases.23,24

Recurrence is also related to tumor size and extent of
resection: tumors that have been completely resected have
a recurrence rate of 10% to 30% at 10 years, whereas subtotally resected tumors (Simpson grade IV) have a recurrence rate of 61% at 10 years.23,25-27
Currently, meningioma metastases are found incidentally. Because virtually 100% of meningiomas in culture15 and in vivo5 contain somatostatin receptors,28 and
because SSTR2 and SSTR5 bind octreotide, a somatostatin analog,29 111In-octreotide scintigraphy can be used to

meningiomas appears to represent clinically unrecognized
pulmonary metastases. In addition, the presence of pulmonary metastases appears to portend a negative prognosis as well being predictive of a poor response to salvage
chemotherapy and a very short OS. Therefore, we suggest
that if an 111In-octreotide scintigraphy scan is obtained,
one needs to include not only the head area, but the whole
body to detect rare but possible lung metastasis. The true
incidence and impact of pulmonary metastases in this subset of patients should be corroborated in a prospective
clinical trial.

of overall survival between the current study and a previously
reported prospective study of octreotide acetate in patients
with recurrent meningioma15 is shown. Solid line indicates

(90%-100%).13,30 Because to our knowledge the current
study is only the second report of 111In-octreotide scintigraphy use for the detection of meningioma metastasis,14
and the first in which one of the cases had pathological
confirmation, it is impossible to calculate the sensitivity of
this method to detect pulmonary meningiomas.
The presence of positive lung lesions in the patients
in the current study also raises the possibility of a secondary, synchronous neoplasm. However, to our knowledge
there is very limited literature regarding the percentage of
patients with meningioma who also are harboring a different neoplasm, with only a weak association between meningioma and breast cancer reported.31 As such, the most
common etiology for isolated octreotide-positive pulmonary nodules remains lung cancer of both non-small cell
and small cell type.32,33 Because lung cancer is the second
most common cancer in the United States, with an incidence of 60 cases per 100,000 individuals,34 whereas meningioma has the highest age-adjusted incidence rate of all brain
tumors (5.04 and 2.46 for females and males, respectively),3
it is possible although very rare that the 2 neoplasms can
coexist in the same patient. In contrast, approximately 1% of
all patients with meningiomas35 and up to 43% of patients
with anaplastic meningiomas36 develop distant metastases,
suggesting that the majority of the lung lesions in these
patients are metastatic meningiomas.
The results of this small, retrospective study suggest
that the presence of 111In-octreotide–avid pulmonary
lesions in patients with recurrent, treatment-refractory
