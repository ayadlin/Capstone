ABSTRACT
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) continues to be one of the deadliest
cancers due to the absence of effective treatment. Curaxins are a class of small
molecules with anti-cancer activity demonstrated in different models of cancer in mice.
The lead curaxin compound, CBL0137, recently entered Phase I clinical trials. Curaxins
modulate several important signaling pathways involved in the pathogenesis of PDA
through inhibition of chromatin remodeling complex FACT. FACT is overexpressed
in multiple types of tumor, with one of the highest rate of overexpression in PDA
(59%). In this study, the efficacy of CBL0137 alone or in combination with current
standard of care, gemcitabine, was tested against different models of PDA in vitro and
in mouse models. It was found that CBL0137 alone is a potent inducer of apoptosis
in pancreatic cancer cell lines and is toxic not only for proliferating bulk tumor cells,
but also for pancreatic cancer stem cells. In mice, CBL0137 was effective against
several PDA models, including orthotopic gemcitabine resistant PANC-1 model and
patient derived xenografts, in which CBL0137 anti-tumor effect correlated with
overexpression of FACT. Moreover, we observed synergy of CBL0137 with gemcitabine
which may be explained by the ability of CBL0137 to inhibit several transcriptional
programs induced by gemcitabine, including NF-kappaB response and expression of
ribonucleotide reductase, one of the targets of gemcitabine in cells. This data suggest
testing of CBL0137 efficacy in Phase II trial in PDA patients alone and in combination
with gemcitabine.

INTRODUCTION

patients will not be eligible for FOLFINOX due to its
toxicity [1-3]. Thus, novel therapies are urgently needed.
CBL0137 is a member of a new class of recently
discovered candidate anti-cancer agents, named curaxins,
that modulate several important signaling pathways
involved in the pathogenesis of pancreatic ductal
adenocarcinoma (PDA, [4]). In particular, CBL0137
and related molecules can simultaneously activate p53
and inhibit cellular stress pathways mediated by NFκB and HSF-1 [4], [5, 6]. One of the most significant
factors predisposing patients to PDA is chronic pancreatic

Mortality from pancreatic cancer is close to 100%
due to the absence of effective treatment approaches.
Current frontline therapies of gemcitabine + nabpaclitaxel, or FOLFINOX (infusional 5-fluorouracil,
leucovorin, irinotecan and oxaloplatin) have demonstrated
some progress in treatment above gemcitabine, the
standard of care agent (median overall survival 8.5-11
months vs ~6 months for gemcitabine), however, patients

inflammation accompanied by constitutive activity of
NF-κB (reviewed in [7]). In addition, the heat shock
response stress pathway, which is mediated by HSF1, is
also frequently overactive in PDA cells [8]. The effects
of CBL0137 on these pathways, culminating in tumor
cell death, are mediated by the inhibition of FACT [4], a
chromatin remodeling complex composed of SSRP1 and
SPT16 subunits, that is involved in the transcription of
genes with highly ordered chromatin structure, replication,
and mitosis [9-11]. Curaxins are indirect inhibitors of
FACT: they bind DNA without causing DNA breaks or any
other sort of damage and without activating DNA damage
sensitive signaling pathways [4]. They do however cause
topological alteration in the DNA helix to which FACT
is sensitive. FACT binds with high affinity to DNA in
the presence of curaxins and is unable to bind histones
to perform its normal chromatin remodeling function [4].
FACT is expressed during early embryogenesis and
in undifferentiated progenitors and stem cells of adult
tissues while protein levels of both FACT subunits are
almost undetectable in differentiated cells of adult tissues
[12]. FACT is overexpressed in several tumor types
compared to equivalent normal tissues. In particular,
SSRP1 is expressed in a high proportion of lung and
pancreatic cancers (~45-59%) [13]. FACT positive tumors
are associated with an aggressive malignant phenotype
(high grade, metastatic disease, worse overall survival)
[13]. Therefore, FACT represents a potentially important
target for cancer therapy. Taken together, these data
suggested that CBL0137 may be effective against PDA.
In the studies presented here, the levels of the
indirect CBL0137 target, FACT (SSRP1 and SPT16
subunits), were examined in patient PDA surgical samples
and the effect of CBL0137 monotherapy or combination
with gemcitabine was evaluated using patient derived PDA
xenografts and PANC-1 orthotopic tumors. In addition,
potential mechanisms for the combined efficacy observed
between CBL0137 and gemcitabine were investigated.
CBL0137 was efficacious against mouse models of
PDA and enhanced the effect of gemcitabine by causing
a significant delay in tumor regrowth following the
completion of treatment. The data presented here suggests
that the combined effects may be a result of CBL0137
targeting of PDA stem cells as well as its modulation of
the expression of genes that affect gemcitabine sensitivity
in PDA cells. Together, these data indicate that CBL0137
may provide a clinical benefit for the treatment of PDA,
particularly when combined with gemcitabine.

CBL0137 is toxic for gemcitabine-sensitive and
resistant pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cells
To test the effect of CBL0137 on gemcitabinesensitive and -resistant PDA cells, MiaPaCa-2 and
PANC-1 human PDA cell lines were used, which are
gemcitabine-sensitive and resistant, respectively [14].
Both cell lines were sensitive to CBL0137 in 72h viability
assays (Fig.1A, B). Importantly, while treatment with
CBL0137 led to complete absence of living cells at
concentrations above 2.5 µM, gemcitabine treatment,
which as reported was more effective against MiaPaCa-2
than PANC-1 cells, resulted in growth arrest rather than
cell death since no reduction in the number of living cells
was observed with dose escalation (Fig.1A, B). Consistent
with this observation, we did not see any biochemical
signs of cell death, such as caspase activation or PARP1
cleavage, when we analyzed extracts of cells treated with
gemcitabine using immunoblotting, while the same signs
were evident in extracts of cells treated with CBL0137
(Fig.1C, D).
To test if CBL0137 could increase the toxicity of
gemcitabine to sensitive and resistant cells, a colony
forming assay was performed in which MiaPaCa-2 and
PANC-1 cells which were treated for 4h with either
drug alone or their combination. Surprisingly, CBL0137
caused a greater reduction in the number of colonies
formed of not only MiaPaCa-2 cells when combined with
gemcitabine, but also gemcitabine-resistant PANC-1 cells
(Fig.1E, F). Thus, CBL0137 is toxic for pancreatic cancer
cells independently of their sensitivity to gemcitabine
and, moreover, is able to increase the sensitivity of
both gemcitabine-sensitive and resistant PDA cells to
gemcitabine.

Anti-tumor effect of CBL0137 on gemcitabineresistant tumor in mice
In order to determine whether the effect of CBL0137
monotherapy and combination with gemcitabine occurred
in vivo, an orthotopic model of PANC-1, in which
PANC-1 cells were inoculated directly into the tail of the
pancreas of athymic nude mice, was utilized. Two weeks
after inoculation, mice were treated for 4 weeks with
90 mg/kg CBL0137 intravenously (i.v.) once per week,
40 mg/kg gemcitabine intraperitoneally (i.p.) every 4th
day (Q4d) or a combination of the two agents. A fourth
treatment group received only the corresponding vehicles.
One week following the end of treatment, mice were
euthanized and tumors of the pancreas measured and then
collected for histological analysis. While CBL0137 and
gemcitabine monotherapy had only a modest effect on
11039

PANC-1 orthotopic tumor growth, which failed to reach
statistical significance (39% and 20% growth inhibition,
respectively), the combination of the two agents caused
a substantial decrease in PANC-1 tumor growth (78%
growth inhibition, P=0.0002; Fig. 2A). Histological
examination of multiple sections of the pancreatic
tissues from each mouse confirmed the anti-tumor effect
of CBL0137 monotherapy and the combination and a
more minor effect by gemcitabine (Fig. 2B). Based on
the analysis, the vehicle control tumors were actively
growing with numerous mitoses present. There were
almost no apoptotic bodies and no evidence of necrosis
or infiltration of lymphoid cells (Fig. 2B). There was also

extensive tumor growth observed in the pancreases of the
gemcitabine monotherapy mice with only single apoptotic
tumor cells visible (Fig. 2B). In contrast, the CBL0137
monotherapy group and the CBL0137-gemcitabine
combination group samples showed large necrotic fields,
numerous apoptotic bodies and loss of tumor cells. In
addition, there was infiltration of lymphoid cells into and
adjacent to the remaining tumor (Fig. 2B). Thus CBL0137
demonstrated an anti-tumor effect in gemcitabine-resistant
tumors and also potentiated the anti-tumor efficacy of
gemcitabine when used in combination.

Anti-tumor activity of CBL0137 against
patient derived xenografts of pancreatic ductal
adenocarcinoma in mice

It was previously shown that the toxicity of
CBL0137 to syngeneic pairs of tumor cells in vitro was
dependent on the level of FACT [4]. However, the level of
FACT in these cells was artificially reduced or increased,
which may not reflect the natural dependence of cells on
FACT. Moreover, inhibition of FACT expression in vitro
is toxic for tumor cells and, therefore, no FACT-null cells
could be generated for testing whether CBL0137 has
anti-tumor effect in the absence of FACT. Furthermore, a
naturally occurring FACT-negative cell line was not found
among multiple cell lines of different origin that were
tested in vitro (unpublished data). At the same time, FACT
was present in only 59% of PDA samples from patients
as judged by the immunohistochemical (IHC) staining
of tissue microarrays (TMA) for the FACT subunit,
SSRP1 [13]. Therefore, the dependence of CBL0137
anti-tumor activity on FACT subunit expression was

In addition to testing the in vivo efficacy of
CBL0137 against a gemcitabine resistant orthotopic
model, its efficacy was tested against more clinically
relevant models of PDA, namely patient derived PDA
tumors grown in SCID mice. Since patient samples
represent closely the natural heterogeneity and variability
of PDA in the clinic, the use of patient derived xenograft
(PDX) models not only allowed for the evaluation of
the anti-tumor efficacy of CBL0137 in general, but also
whether or not the expression of the indirect target of
CBL0137, FACT, correlates with tumor response to
CBL0137.

mg/kg CBL0137 i.v. 1/week, 40 mg/kg gemcitabine (GEM) i.p. Q4d or combination of CBL0137 and gemcitabine. Mice were treated for

tested in vivo against a panel of patient-derived pancreatic
cancer xenografts (PDX) with varied expression of
FACT subunits (Table 1). Upon receipt of a sample, part
of the tumor was taken for IHC analysis of SSRP1 and
SPT16 subunits and the remaining tumor was implanted
into donor SCID mice. In addition, tumor was collected
after passage in donor mice before transplantation into
recipient mice. Based on TMA staining consisting of
biopsy samples [13], it was expected that approximately
half of the obtained patient samples would be negative
for FACT. Surprisingly, however, all 10 samples were
positive for SSRP1 and SPT16 (Table 1) and the levels
of expression did not significantly change after passaging
of tumors in SCID mice (Fig.S1). Staining was highly
specific since each slide contained a mixture of positive
(tumor cells) and negative (some tumor and stroma cells)
cells (Fig. 3A, B and S1). Although there was a high
similarity between the patterns of SSRP1 and SPT16
staining in the samples, there was no similarity between
the staining of FACT subunits and Ki67 staining (Fig.
3 and S1). Furthermore, a comparison of the scores for
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

intensity of staining and proportion of SSRP1/SPT16
or Ki67 positive cells revealed a significant positive
correlation (r>0.6 and p<0.05) only between SSRP1 and
SPT16 staining, but not between any of them and Ki67
staining (Table 1), confirming our previous observation
made using normal tissues that FACT is not a marker of
proliferating cells [12]. Interestingly, although not highly
significant, some correlations were observed between time
to engraftment (start of growth) of PDX in donor mice
and Ki67 or SSRP1/SPT16 scores. This correlation was
negative for Ki67 as expected, suggesting that samples
with high proliferation rate start growing faster, but
positive for SSRP1/SPT16, i.e. highly FACT positive
samples, engrafted slower (Table 1). This again indicated
that FACT is not a marker of quickly proliferating cells.
Based on this data, the efficacy of CBL0137 as a
single agent was determined using four independent
PDX samples with varying levels of FACT expression
(Table 1): PDX #10978 (high FACT expression, SSRP1/
SPT16 scores 9/9, Fig.3A), PDX #13590 (intermediate

Effect of CBL0137 on the sensitivity of pancreatic
PDX models to gemcitabine

PDX #15010 (lower FACT expression, SSRP1/SPT16
scores 4/2, Fig.S1A), and PDX #13756 (the lowest FACT
expression, SSRP1/SPT16 scores 2/2, Fig.3B). Three of
the four PDX samples responded to CBL0137 treatment
(Table 2). The response varied from partial regression
(#10978, very high FACT) to suppression of tumor growth
(#13590 and #15010 intermediate and low levels of FACT,
respectively). In contrast, PDX #13756 with the lowest
level of FACT among the four samples had little or no
response to CBL0137 treatment (26% growth inhibition).
Thus, there was a tendency for a higher response to
CBL0137 monotherapy from PDX tumors with higher
levels of FACT compared to tumor with the lowest level
of FACT. This trend necessitates a study of the correlation
between FACT expression in PDA tumors and patient
response to CBL0137 in clinical trials.

In order to better understand the potential clinical
benefits of CBL0137, the efficacy of CBL0137 combined
with gemcitabine, was evaluated using PDX #13756
and #13590 models described above. For these studies,
tumor bearing mice received the following treatments
for up to 4 weeks: 1) vehicle, 2) 40 mg/kg gemcitabine
i.p. Q4d, 3) 80-90 mg/kg CBL0137 i.v. once per week,
4) gemcitabine + CBL0137. The combination was
administered at the same doses and schedules as indicated
for the monotherapies.
PDX #13756 was particularly sensitive to
gemcitabine with 75-100% of tumors in all groups
receiving gemcitabine as part of their treatment regimens
either regressing or disappearing by Day 15 of treatment
(Fig. 4A). Consistent with initial testing of CBL0137
against PDX#13756, CBL0137 monotherapy had
little effect on tumor growth in this experiment (Fig.
4A). Surprisingly, CBL0137, although inactive on its

Figure 4: Effect of CBL0137 and gemcitabine on patient derived PDA xenograft models. PDX#13756 or #13590 were
inoculated into each flank of SCID mice (n=5/group (A,B) or n=10/group (C,D)). When at least one tumor per mouse reached ~50 mm3,
treatment began with vehicle, 50-90 mg/kg CBL0137 i.v. 1/week, 20 mg/kg gemcitabine (GEM) i.p. Q4d or combination of CBL0137 and
gemcitabine. Mice were treated for 4 weeks. Mice were followed for up to 90 days from start of treatment or when at least one tumor per
mouse reached 1000 mm3. (A, B) Mean fold tumor growth was calculated by normalizing the tumor volume on Day X to that on Day 1

own, enhanced the effect of gemcitabine on tumors as
demonstrated by an increased latency for tumor regrowth
(Fig. 4A). This effect was further illustrated by increasing
the median survival time (MST) from 54 days for the
gemcitabine only group to 78 days for its combination
with CBL0137 (P=0.0153, LogRank test).
In contrast to PDX #13756, PDX #13590 was
sensitive to both monotherapies with CBL0137 only
slightly less efficacious than gemcitabine (Fig. 4B). The
majority of tumors from mice of gemcitabine treatment
group demonstrated tumor regression or complete
disappearance by the end of the treatment period. Such
regression was only observed with 30% of tumors in mice
of the CBL0137 monotherapy group. Similarly to the
#13756 study, the addition of CBL0137 to the gemcitabine
regimen increased the latency of tumor regrowth compared
to gemcitabine alone such that tumors implanted in four of
the five mice in the CBL0137-gemcitabine combination
group failed to reach the tumor size endpoint of 1000 mm3
two months after the end of treatment (mean tumor volume
Day 88 222.7 ± 67.2 mm3). In contrast, 3 of the 4 mice
in the gemcitabine monotherapy group were euthanized
between days 73-79 from start of treatment due to at least

one tumor of a mouse reaching the tumor size endpoint.

CBL0137 enhances gemcitabine activity at suboptimal doses
The studies described above were performed at
or near the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) for once
per week i.v. administration of CBL0137. In order
to understand whether the effect of CBL0137 on the
sensitivity of PDA to gemcitabine can be mediated at
doses below the MTD, which would be beneficial in
clinical trials, dose titration studies were performed for
CBL0137 alone or in combination with gemcitabine using
the PDX #13756 and #13590 models. Tumor bearing
mice received 50-90 mg/kg CBL0137 i.v. once per week
in the presence or absence of 20 mg/kg gemcitabine
administered i.p. Q4d for up to 4 weeks and generated data
was compared to the vehicle only treatment group. Suboptimal doses of 50-60 mg/kg CBL0137 caused similar
enhancement of gemcitabine antitumor activity as that
produced by the MTD dose of 90 mg/kg as indicated by
the lack of statistically significant differences among the

combination groups (Fig. 4C, D). A similar enhancement
of gemcitabine antitumor activity was achieved with
orally delivered CBL0137 in the PDX #13756 model
(Fig. S2A). Furthermore, similar results were achieved
with the CBL0137-gemcitabine combination using H1975
non-small cell lung cancer xenografts, indicating that the

To further investigate the role of CBL0137 in
the enhancement of gemcitabine activity, the effect of
CBL0137 on the expression of other factors associated
with resistance/sensitivity to gemcitabine. These factors
belong to several functional classes, including nucleoside
transporters (e.g. hENTs), enzymes of nucleotide
metabolism (e.g. deoxycytidine kinase (dCK), cytidine
deaminase (CDA), ribonucleotide reductase (RNR)
subunits RRM1 and RRM2, and general anti-apoptotic
factors (e.g. XIAP) (reviewed in [19]). Treatment of
human pancreatic cancer cells with CBL0137 resulted in
a dose dependent reduction of protein and mRNA levels of
RRM1 and RRM2, (Fig.S3A). Importantly, CBL0137 was
able to prevent gemcitabine induced expression of RRM1
and RRM2 on mRNA and protein levels (Fig.5C, D). No
significant changes across cell lines tested were observed
in the expression of ENT1, CDA and dCK protein levels.
These data suggest that CBL0137 affects different aspects
of gemcitabine resistance most probably through the
inhibition of transcription of genes that are induced by
gemcitabine treatment and may play a role in gemcitabine
resistance.

CBL0137 influences different mechanisms of
pancreatic cancer resistance to gemcitabine
CBL0137 inhibits FACT function through depletion
of the pool of active FACT involved in transcription
elongation ([4] and Fig.5D). This leads to the inhibition
of transcription regulated by several transcriptional
factors whose function depends on FACT, e.g. NF-κB
[4]. Activation of NF-κB in tumor cells has been shown
to be responsible for resistance to different types of
chemotherapeutic drugs, including gemcitabine [15-18].
As demonstrated with several pancreatic cancer cell lines,
CBL0137 inhibits NF-κB reporter activity induced by
TNF and blocks expression of the endogenous NF-κB
targets, IL-8 and TNF, including that which is induced by

3D (serum free soft agar based medium) and in 2D (on
plastic in regular medium). PANC-1 and MiaPaCa-2 cells
were treated in suspension with different concentrations
of CBL0137 for 1 h and then plated either in 3D or 2D
conditions. CBL0137 treatment led to similar dose
dependence loss of colony forming ability in both
conditions and complete disappearance of cells at 3µM
either grown on plastic or in semisolid medium (Fig. 6
D, E).
Based on this collection of data, CBL0137 appeared
to be toxic for CSCs to the same or even greater extent
than to bulk tumor cell population. Since toxicity of
CBL0137 cells depends on FACT expression and previous
analysis of FACT expression on mRNA and protein
levels suggested that it is a marker of normal stem cells
[12], FACT expression levels in pancreatic CSCs were
determined in order to understand the toxicity of CBL0137
to CSCs. SSRP1 levels were compared between CD24Hi/
CD44Hi and CD24Lo/CD44Lo PANC-1 cell populations.
Although SSRP1 is expressed in most PANC-1 cells, its
level in CD24Hi/CD44Hi cells was significantly higher than
in CD24Lo/CD44Lo, suggesting that indeed FACT is highly
expressed in CSCs thereby making these cells sensitive to
CBL0137 toxicity (Fig.6F).

It was proposed that the relapse of pancreatic
and other cancers after treatment with cytostatic drugs,
including gemcitabine, in the clinic may be due to the
inability of these drugs to eliminate slowly dividing
cancer stem cells (CSC) since their mechanism of activity
is dependent on DNA replication [20]. Since the toxic
effect of CBL0137 does not depend on cell proliferation,
the effect of CBL0137 and gemcitabine on the cancer
stem cell (CSC) population was compared. It was
shown that treatment of PANC-1 cells with gemcitabine
led to enrichment of CSC population, defined as “side
population” using flow cytometry because of their ability
to efflux Hoechst 33342 dye due to high expression
of multi-drug transporters. [21]. Consistent with the
literature, gemcitabine caused an increase in the “side
population” (Fig. 6A). In contrast, treatment of cells
with CBL0137 did not increase the “side population”.
Furthermore, CBL0137 prevented the increase of “side
population” induced by gemcitabine, suggesting that
CBL0137 is as toxic for CSCs as for proliferating tumor
cells and, moreover, is able to prevent gemcitabineinduced enrichment of CSCs.
Pancreatic CSCs can also be identified using several
surface markers, among which CD24, CD44 and CD326
are the best established [22, 23]. Therefore, to confirm
the toxic effect of CBL0137 on CSCs, these cell surface
markers were evaluated in PANC-1 cells following
treatment with CBL0137. In the experiment, tumor cells
were treated with different concentrations of CBL0137 for
1h, and then left to grow for an additional 72h. The number
of CSCs was determined by flow cytometry following
staining for CD24/CD44/CD326 surface markers. In
comparison to control cells, there was a dose-dependent
decrease of the CD24HiCD44HiCD326Hi population in cells
treated with CBL0137 (Fig. 6B), suggesting that CBL0137
may be even more toxic to CSCs than to the bulk tumor
cell population.
Additionally, the ability of CBL0137 to abrogate
the accumulation of CSC in vitro was investigated using
pancreatic tumor cells propagated under conditions
specifically developed for CSC enrichment by Benayon
and Shaked ([24], see details in Material and Methods).
Specifically, the amount of CD24HiCD44HiCD326Hi cells
in the population of PANC-1 cells maintained in regular
and CSC-enrichment conditions was determined with or
without pre-treatment with CBL0137. While the amount
of CD24HiCD44HiCD326Hi cells was significantly increased
upon propagation in “CSC enrichment” conditions,
pretreatment of cells with CBL0137 blocked this increase
in CD24HiCD44HiCD326Hi cells (Fig. 6C).
Finally, since one of the critical properties of
CSC is ability for anchorage independent growth, we

DISCUSSION
CBL0137 is a first in class anti-cancer drug
candidate that is an inhibitor of the histone chaperone,
FACT [4]. FACT was recently shown to be a novel target
in cancer due to its frequent overexpression in different
types of cancer and dependence of survival of tumor,
but not normal cells, on FACT function [13]. One of the
highest rate of FACT overexpression is in PDA, 59% of
all tumor samples [13]. However the important question is
whether tumors that are negative for FACT (41% of PDA)
would respond to CBL0137 treatment. In other words, can
FACT be used as a predictive marker of CBL0137 efficacy
in clinic?
Establishment of a predictive biomarker of
CBL0137 efficacy will allow selection of patient with the
highest chance of response while conserving resources
of other patients for different types of treatment. Direct
expression of the drug target and confirmed dependence of
tumor cells on this target are the most reliable predictors
of drug activity. In the case of curaxins (i.e. CBL0137),
this situation “is complicated”, since although they inhibit
FACT, it is not FACT but DNA that is their direct target
and DNA is present in all cancer cells. However, since
curaxins do not cause DNA damage and do not appear
to inhibit DNA-related processes in cell-free systems
(i.e., replication, transcription, TF binding to consensus
elements ([4] and unpublished data), it is not yet certain
that the act of curaxin binding to DNA in itself has any
direct anti-cancer effect. Thus, FACT, although an indirect
target, is likely the most sensitive factor to curaxins in
11047

cells. However, FACT-independent toxicity of curaxins
cannot be excluded without testing curaxins in FACTnull cells. Although attempts to model this situation in
vitro using syngeneic tumor cell pairs demonstrated
that toxicity of curaxins to tumor cells was dependent
on FACT expression [4], it did not validate FACT as
predictive marker of curaxins efficacy. First, artificial
modulation of FACT levels in cells did not model natural
dependence of tumor cell survival on FACT expression.
Second, inhibition of FACT expression in all tumor cell
lines tested so far in vitro was toxic for these cells [4] and,
therefore, FACT-null tumor cells could not be established
to test the effect of curaxins on a FACT-null background.
Moreover no naturally occurring FACT-null cells were
identified among >50 cell lines tested in vitro. At the
same time, based on the analysis of TMA, it was expected
that at least half of the patient pancreatic tumors should
be FACT negative [13] and this would therefore make it
possible to test CBL0137 efficacy against PDA of different
FACT status in mice using PDX models. Contrary to
this expectation, all ten PDX samples that were tested
were FACT positive (Table 1). This did not appear to be
a reflection of the fact that they were passaged in mice
since the levels of FACT staining of primary and passaged
tumor were similar. It is possible that the surgical samples
used for PDX studies contained more heterogeneity due to
the size of the sample obtained than the limited available
tumor from biopsies that were used on TMAs. These
potential explanations require further investigation.
Interestingly, although no FACT negative PDX
samples were identified, different degrees of SSRP1
and SPT16 positivity allowed for the observations of
some correlations. First, previous tumor analysis used
only SSRP1 staining [13], while in the current study, an
optimized SPT16 staining procedure was employed to
get data for the expression of both FACT subunits. In this
study, there was a significant correlation between SSRP1
and SPT16 expression; however, it was lower than for
normal tissues analyzed before (r=0.6 vs r>0.9 in normal
tissues [12]. This suggests a potential tumor-specific
independent function of either of the subunits, which was
not evident in normal tissues. Second, consistent with
previous data, there was no significant correlation between
Ki67 and FACT expression (Table 1), confirming that
FACT is not a marker of cell proliferation [12]. Curiously,
although the period of time needed for engraftment of
PDX samples had a tendency for a negative correlation
with the number of proliferating (Ki67+) cells in a sample,
this correlation was positive with FACT expression.
Therefore, it may be hypothesized that if FACT is a
marker of slowly dividing CSC, then samples rich in these
types of cells need more time to reach palpable size due to
slower proliferation.
At the same time, the limited difference in FACT
expression levels between different samples did not allow
us to draw accurate conclusions about the correlation of
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

FACT level with sensitivity of PDX samples to CBL0137.
The only suggestive observation is that the sample with
the lowest level of FACT expression was almost resistant
to CBL0137, while the sample with the highest expression
of FACT was the most sensitive (partial tumor regression
in response to CBL0137 (Table 2). Although this is
opposite to what was observed with syngeneic cell pairs
with artificially reduced or elevated FACT levels [4], this
can be explained from the standpoint of the theory of
cancer cell addiction to the activity of certain factor. If the
concept of cell addiction to a certain factor is excluded,
then elevation of this factor will make cells more resistant
to the drug inhibiting this factor and vice versa, which is
the situation observed with syngeneic cell pairs. However,
in naturally occurring tumor cells, high level of expression
may indicate high dependence of cells on the activity of
this factor and, therefore, even minimal reduction of its
level may significantly affect viability of cells whereas
low expression may suggest low or no dependence and,
therefore, inhibition of this factor with a drug may have
no significant effect on cell viability.
One important aspect of this study is the
demonstration that CBL0137 is toxic to pancreatic cancer
cells independently of their sensitivity to the standard of
care drug gemcitabine. This finding was expected based
on the differences in the mechanisms of action of the
two drugs. Gemcitabine is a nucleoside analog in which
the hydrogen atoms on the 2’ carbon of deoxycytidine
are replaced by fluorine atoms. Triphosphate analogue
of gemcitabine replaces cytidine during DNA synthesis,
which inhibits DNA replication. Additionally the
diphosphate analogue of gemcitabine binds to
ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) active site and inactivates
the enzyme irreversibly. Once RNR is inhibited, the cell
cannot produce the deoxyribonucleotides required for
DNA replication and repair, and cell apoptosis is induced
[25]. Although the induction of apoptosis with gemcitabine
treatment in pancreatic cancer cell lines was reported in
the literature [26-28], there were no observed biochemical
signs of apoptosis in the cell lines used in the current study
upon treatment with gemcitabine (Fig.1C, D). Moreover,
growth curves of cells in the presence of gemcitabine
suggested growth inhibitory effects with no reduction
of cell number with increasing gemcitabine dose after a
certain concentration and multiple live cells were detected
72 h after the start of treatment even at the highest dose
of gemcitabine used (Fig.1A, B). In contrast, CBL0137
treatment cause a clear dose dependent reduction of cells
up to complete absence of cells at concentrations >2.5µM,
which was confirmed by the presence of all biochemical
markers of apoptosis tested (Fig.1A-D).
It was previously determined that CBL0137 does
not require cell proliferation for the anti-tumor effect
(unpublished data). This was confirmed when CBL0137
was combined with gemcitabine. Although the latter
cause strong growth arrest, CBL0137 was still able to
11048

Oncotarget

induce apoptosis in cancer cells when it was used on the
background of gemcitabine treatment (Fig.1C, D). In
line with this, in all cases in vitro and in vivo presented
here, improved efficacy of gemcitabine was observed
in the presence of CBL0137. This did not depend on
whether the pancreatic tumor was resistant or sensitive to
CBL0137 alone or gemcitabine alone, suggesting that the
combination of two drugs may be useful in many cases
when each of them alone does not have potent anti-tumor
effect. The reasons for the synergistic activity of two drugs
against tumors, but not normal tissues (no significant
increase in toxicity was observed even though both
drugs were used at close to MTD doses) may be in tumor
specific mechanisms of pancreatic cancer cells resistance
to gemcitabine, which can be alleviated by CBL0137
treatment. For example, it was reported that constitutive or
induced NF-κB activity in cancer cells makes them much
more resistant to gemcitabine due to NF-κB controlled
expression of several anti-apoptotic factors, such as
Bcl2 or IAP family of proteins [16]. In fact, in this study,
gemcitabine was a potent inducer of NF-κB transcriptional
activity in pancreatic cancer cells and this induction was
completely blocked by CBL0137 (Fig. 5A, B).
Surprisingly, this expected mechanism was not
the only one observed in PDA cells that might explain
the synergistic toxicity of gemcitabine and CBL0137.
CBL0137 was also a potent inhibitor of basal and
gemcitabine induced expression of RNR subunits RRM1
and RRM2. In addition to blocking DNA repair, inhibition
of RNR, the rate-limiting enzyme in deoxyribonucleoside
triphosphate (dNTP) synthesis, reduces the endogenous
dNTP pool, and indirectly facilitates gemcitabine
metabolite incorporation into DNA [29]. The
transcriptional upregulation of RRM1 and RRM2 has been
consistently observed in pancreatic tumors resistant to
gemcitabine [30-32] and pancreatic cancer cell lines [31].
Clinically, low RRM2 mRNA expression levels correlated
with significantly enhanced disease-free, median, and
overall survival as well as overall response rate in
gemcitabine treated patients [33, 34]. The mechanism of
how CBL0137 inhibits expression of RRMs is not clear,
since little is known about how gene expression of these
subunits is regulated.
Finally, similar to the clinical situation, gemcitabine
treatment of PDX as a single agent resulted in tumor
regression and complete disappearance of tumors in some
mice, which was followed by tumor relapse, suggesting
that some resistant cells are able to survive gemcitabine
treatment and become a source of recurrent tumor. It is
believed that CSCs play a crucial role in establishment
of drug resistance and relapse of tumors [35, 36]. For
many standard of care chemotherapeutic drugs it has
been shown that while they eliminate the bulk population
of proliferating tumor cells, they stimulate the growth
and expansion of CSCs [35, 36]. CBL0137 treatment
significantly reduced relapse of PDX after gemcitabine
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

treatment (Fig. 4 and S2), suggesting that CBL0137
may effectively eliminate CSCs. Previously, the indirect
target of CBL0137, FACT, was found to be a marker of
normal stem cells [12]. The study described here suggests
that FACT might also be a marker of CSCs (Fig. 6D). If
FACT is a specific target of CSCs, then drugs targeting
FACT, such as CBL0137, become promising candidates
for CSC elimination. Indeed, CBL0137 was able to inhibit
gemcitabine-induced CSC enrichment, which, together
with the in vivo data, makes CBL0137 a reasonable and
promising adjuvant for gemcitabine: while the latter
eliminates bulk population, the former kills CSCs thereby
preventing reoccurrence of cancer.

for 2 days. Then floating cell spheres enriched for CSCs
were collected and transferred to a new plate supplemented
with fresh DMEM:F12/GF medium, the initial plate was
also supplemented with fresh DMEM:F12/GF medium.
Sphere collection procedure was repeated 2 more times
with a 2 day interval after which all cells were collected
for FACS analysis.

Cytotoxicity assay
Cells were plated in 96 well plates at 10-20%
confluency. After overnight incubation, drugs were
added to cells as ten 2-fold serial dilutions. Control
for no toxicity was 0.1% DMSO and for complete cell
death - 50µM solution of 9-aminoacridine. All treatments
were done in triplicate. Cell viability was assessed at 72
hrs after start of treatment using Cell Titer Blue Assay
(Promega, Madison, WI). Mean readings from wells
with 9-aminacridine were subtracted from all other wells,
after that cell viability was calculated at mean reading of
three replicates for all treated conditions relative to mean
reading of wells treated with 0.1% DMSO.

Stem cell identification using the Hoechst 33342
side population (SP) assay
Assay was done according to [37-39] with
several modifications. PANC-1 cells were collected by
trypsinization, and then trypsin was inhibited by FBS.
Cells were then washed with 1xPBS and re-suspended
in 1xHanks Buffer supplemented with 1% of FBS.
Verapamil (100µM, (Krackler Scientific, Albany, NY)) or
KO-143 (1µM, kindly provided by Dr. W. Huss, Roswell
Park Cancer Institute) were used for inhibition of drug
transporters in “no-SP”- control samples: 15 minute, 37°C.
Control and experimental cell samples were incubated
with Hoechst 33342 (5µg/ml) for 1.5h at 37°C with gentle
pipetting every 15 minutes. Cells were than pelleted
and the pellet was resuspended in 1x PBS and analyzed
by FACS. FACS analysis was performed at RPCI flow
cytometry facility on a LSA II UV A flow cytometer (BD
Biosciences, San Jose, CA). For each cell line, the proper
scatter parameters were identified and then cytometry was
performed accordingly using BlueA 645 LP filter with
a 502LP mirror. At least 100,000 events (singlets) were
collected for each sample. The data were analyzed using
the WinList 3D program (Verity Software House, USA).
Side population location was estimated for each treatment
condition using Verapamil/Ko143-pretreated samples.

Colony assay
Cells were plated at 103 per well of 6-well plate in
triplicates. After attachment, cells were treated with drugs
for 4 hrs and then medium was changed to drug-free
medium. The number of colonies was counted 10-14 days
later using methylene blue staining.

Comparison of cell growth in 2D and 3D
conditions
Cells were resuspended in serum free DMEM and
treated with different concentrations of CBL0137 for 1h.

commenced. Mice were treated for 4 weeks. One week
after treatment was finished, mice were euthanized, the
tumors measured upon necropsy and then pancreas with
tumor was fixed and stained with H&E for histological
analysis.
Patient derived xenografts (PDX) model.
Pancreatic tumor surgical samples were obtained with
approval from the Institutional Review Board of RPCI.
For in vivo efficacy studies, the patient derived tumors
were passaged through severe combined immunodeficient
(SCID) mice (RPCI Laboratory Animal Resource) as
already described [4] with some modifications. Frozen
tumor pieces (8-10mm3) were thawed on ice and after
that transplanted into two flanks of 2 donor SCID mice
subcutaneously. 2-3 additional tumor pieces were washed
in cold PBS and fixed in 10% buffered formalin for
H&E and IHC staining. When any of tumors in donor
mice reached 500mm3 the tumor was excised from the
anesthetized mouse, washed with PBS and cut into
8-10mm3 pieces and re-transplanted in 10 recipient mice.
Again part (1/3-1/2) of tumor sample was used for H&E
and IHC staining. For combination studies, 2-5 mm pieces
were implanted into each flank of SCID mice. For all PDX
studies, treatment was started when at least one tumor per
mouse reached ~50 mm3. Mice were distributed between
groups using alternating method. Mice were monitored
daily, weighed 3-5 times per week and tumor size was
measured with digital caliper a minimum of twice per
week.
H1975 non-small cell lung cancer cells (5x106,)
were inoculated in a single flank of athymic nude mice
as a 1:1 mixture with matrigel. Treatment commenced
when tumors reached ~150-200 mm3. Mice were followed
until tumors reached 2000 mm3 or 7 weeks from start of
treatment.
Treatments: The following regimens were used:
1) vehicles, 100mg/kg captisol i.v. and sterile water via
gavage, 2) 50- 90 mg/kg CBL0137 in 100 mg/ml captisol
i.v. delivered via tail vein once per week, 3) 10-20 mg/kg
CBL0137 p.o. via oral gavage, 5 days on/2 days off, 4) 20
or 40 mg/kg gemcitabine in sterile water i.p. every fourth
day or 4) CBL0137 and gemcitabine at the indicated
regimens. Mice were treated for 4 weeks.
Tumor measurement was done with digital
calipers. Tumor volume was calculated using the equation
L x W2/2 where L is the longest dimension and W is the
dimension perpendicular to W [42]. Mice were followed
until at least one tumor per mouse reached 1000 mm3 or
90 days from start of treatment, whichever came first.
Mean fold tumor growth was calculated relative Day 1
(tumor volume Day X/tumor volume Day 1). Comparisons
of tumor growth across groups were performed using
ANOVA (GraphPad Prism 6).

Gene expression analysis by real-time PCR
MiaPaca2 and BxPC-3 cells were treated with
CBL0137 alone or in combination with gemcitabine for 4
or 24h. 0.1% DMSO served as vehicle control. After the
incubation period, cells were harvested and RNA isolated
using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). cDNA was prepared
using 2 µg RNA, Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Life
technologies, Grand island, NY) and random hexamers
[40]. Expression of RRM1. RRM2, IL-8 and TNF were
determined using Taqman universal master mix with
β2-microglobulin used as an internal control. The PCR
reaction consisted of an initial incubations of 50°C for 2
minutes and 95°C for 10 minutes followed by 40 cycles
of 95 °C for 15 seconds and 60°C for 1 minute. PCR data
were collected with the use the Applied Biosystems 7300
real-time PCR system. The level of target gene expression
was determined using the ∆∆Ct method where the DMSO
control for each comparison was used as the calibrator
[41].

transferred to PVDF membranes. Blots were probed with
antibodies specific for SSRP1, SPT16, RRM1, and RRM2.
GAPDH was used as a loading control. Proteins were
visualized using ECL kit (GE Healthcare).
Immunohistochemical (IHC) and hematoxylin and
eosin (H&E) staining was done in the Pathology Resource
Core of RPCI as already described [12].

Animal studies
All animal studies were performed with approval of
the IACUC of RPCI and State University of New York
Downstate Medical Center. SCID female 5-10 weeks
old mice from DLAR RPCI or athymic nude mice from
Harlan were used.
PANC-1 orthotopic model: 10-week old female
athymic nude mice (n=8 per treatment group) were deeply
anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine. Using laparotomy, 2
x 106 PANC-1 cells were inoculated into the tail of the
pancreas of each mouse. Two weeks following inoculation
(tumor presence confirmed by ultrasound), treatment
