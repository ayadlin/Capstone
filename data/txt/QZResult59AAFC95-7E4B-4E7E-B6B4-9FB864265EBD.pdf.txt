BACKGROUND: Patients with cancer are at increased risk of developing complications of influenza. In this study, the authors assessed
the effectiveness of influenza vaccination among cancer patients. METHODS: A prospective, noninterventional cohort study was conducted during the 2010 to 2011 influenza season. The cohort included adult cancer patients with solid malignancies who were receiving chemotherapy and hematologic patients who had active disease. Patients who died between October and November 2010
(N 5 43) were excluded. A comparison was made between patients who received the 2011 seasonal influenza vaccine with those who
did not. The primary outcome was a composite of hospitalizations for fever or acute respiratory infections, pneumonia, and/or
infection-related chemotherapy interruptions. All-cause mortality was a secondary outcome. A propensity-matched analysis was conducted based on the propensity for vaccination. RESULTS: Of 806 patients who were included, 387 (48%) were vaccinated. Factors
that were associated independently with vaccination included past influenza vaccination, past pneumococcal vaccination, >6 months
since cancer diagnosis, country of birth, and cancer type/status. The primary outcome occurred in 111 of 387 (28.7%) vaccinated
patients versus 112 of 419 (26.7%) unvaccinated patients (P 5.54). No association was observed between vaccination and the primary
outcome in a propensity-matched analysis (N 5 436) or during peak influenza activity. The mortality rate was 11.9% (46 of 387
patients) in vaccinated patients versus 19.1% (80 of 419 patients) in unvaccinated patients (P 5.005). Vaccination retained a significant
association with mortality on multivariable analysis (odds ratio, 2.31; 95% confidence interval, 1.4-3.79) and in a propensity-matched
analysis (odds ratio, 2.39; 95% confidence interval, 1.32-4.32). CONCLUSIONS: Influenza vaccination was associated with lower mortality among cancer patients, although an association with infection-related complications could not be demonstrated. The current

INTRODUCTION
Typically, there are between 3 and 5 million cases of severe illness and up to 500,000 deaths annually worldwide related to
influenza.1 Annual vaccination against influenza is the most effective way to avoid influenza and related complications.2
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization currently recommend vaccination
of immune-suppressed patients.3,4 When the match between vaccine and circulating strains is good, protection rates of
70% to 90% against laboratory-confirmed influenza are expected in healthy adults aged <65 years.5
Patients with hematologic cancer and those with solid malignancies undergoing chemotherapy are at potentially
increased risk of influenza-associated complications.6-9 Compared with the general population, influenza-related hospitalization rates were 4 times higher and mortality was 10 times higher for cancer patients.8-10 Among patients with cancer
who were admitted to hospital with respiratory symptoms during times of a circulating influenza epidemic, from 21% to
33% tested positive for influenza. Case fatality rates ranged between 11% and 33%.10 Thus, the prevention of influenza
among cancer patients is a priority.
Immune suppression as a result of the underlying malignancy and treatment may attenuate the response to influenza
vaccine.6,10 The objective of this study was to assess the clinical outcome of influenza vaccination among cancer patients
in an observational study by comparing clinically relevant outcomes in vaccinated patients versus unvaccinated patients.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Variables and Data Sources

Design and Settings: Prospective,
Noninterventional, Comparative Cohort Study

Comparison (exposure variable): Receipt of the
2011 seasonal influenza vaccine

We obtained local ethics committee approval for the
study, requesting oral informed consent for the telephone/personal interviews. The study was conducted during the 2010 to 2011 influenza season at the Davidoff
Center, Rabin Medical Center. We identified patients
who were receiving chemotherapy between September
2010 and November 2010. Influenza vaccination was
administered between October 1, 2010 and the end of
February 2011. Patients were followed for clinical outcomes starting October 1, 2010 to the end of the influenza
season (end of April 2011). The status of patients
(whether dead or alive) was checked at the end of May
2011, although only deaths up to the end of April were
analyzed. In addition, we conducted telephone or personal interviews in May and June of 2011.
Participants

We included adult cancer patients (aged >18 years) with
solid malignancies who received chemotherapy, or
patients who had active hematologic cancer with or without chemotherapy, or patients postautologous (up to 6
months after transplantation) or allogeneic (at any time)
hematopoietic stem cell transplantation who were followed at the Davidoff Center. We excluded patients who
had untreated solid malignancies (in remission after therapy or primarily untreated); hemato-oncologic patients
who were in remission at least 1 year after therapy;
patients who died before October 1, 2010; and patients
who were insured through health maintenance organizations different from that of the hospital (because these
comprised a small proportion of patients treated in
Davidoffâ€™s Center, and vaccination status data were
incomplete for these patients).
We identified patients through the patient unique
dispensation records of the Pharmacy Services at Davidoff
Center for cytotoxic drugs and biologic treatments for
cancer. We enlisted all patients who received treatment
between September and November 2010 (N 5 1133) and
recorded their cancer and treatment status. Inclusion and
exclusion criteria were applied to this preliminary cohort.
Patients were followed through the hard copy of
their personal medical files in the Davidoff Center and
through the patientsâ€™ electronic health records from the
Centerâ€™s health maintenance organization, including
inpatient and outpatient records. We also conducted telephone or personal interviews to collect data on clinical
outcomes and assure vaccination status.

Administration and receipt of the vaccine was left to
physiciansâ€™ and patientsâ€™ decision. Data on seasonal influenza vaccination were fully recorded in patientsâ€™ electronic
health records. All interviewed patients were asked about
their vaccination status to validate the electronic records.
Viral strains that were included in the 2011 influenza season were A/Perth/16/2009 (H3N2), A/California/7/2009
(H1N1), and B/Brisbane/60/2008. Vaccine matching
with the circulating strains was good.11
Outcomes

The primary clinical outcome was a composite of hospitalizations for fever or acute respiratory infection, and/or
pneumonia necessitating antibiotic treatment, and/or
chemotherapy interruptions related to an infectious condition (eg, any fever or respiratory symptoms, but not
mucositis or diarrhea alone). Secondary clinical outcomes
included influenza-like illness, defined as cough or sore
throat, and measured fever >37.8 C or self-reported
feverishness/chills12; laboratory-confirmed influenza (by
polymerase chain reaction analysis, direct antigen test, or
culture performed for clinical indications); individual
components of the primary outcome; any hospitalization
and hospitalizations days; necessity for antibiotic treatment during hospitalization (defined as at least 1 day of
antibiotic treatment while in hospital); all delays in
planned chemotherapy courses; adverse events related to
administration of the vaccine (fever, local reactions,
other); and survival. All outpatient visits, family physician
visits, outpatient antibiotic prescriptions, and hospitalizations were recorded in the electronic system.
Confounders and effect modifiers

To adjust the comparison for the expected differences
between patients who were or were not vaccinated, we collected a large data set of variables that had the potential to
affect the study outcomes. These included the type of cancer, date of diagnosis, cancer grade, stage, and treatment
(chemotherapy agents and dates); timing of the vaccine in
relation to chemotherapy; sociodemographic information; age; and background diseases, including all risk factors for influenza and its complications (body mass index,
pneumococcal vaccine, and influenza vaccinations in previous years).
Because of the large number of different types of
malignancies and different prognostic grading scores for
each cancer, we defined 2 broad risk categories for the

purpose of adjusting the mortality analyses by baseline
risk of death. High-risk malignancy included metastatic
solid tumors and leukemias, including myelodysplastic
syndromes and stem cell transplantation (allogeneic or autologous) recipients. Low-risk malignancy included nonmetastatic solid cancer, lymphoma, and multiple
myeloma without stem cell transplantation. Each patient
was ascribed to a socioeconomic cluster according to the
Israeli Central Bureau of Statistics clustering,13 which
considers demography, standards of living, education and
knowledge, and employment and unemployment.
Study size

We planned to recruit a minimum of 600 patients,
including 240 vaccinated patients and 360 unvaccinated
patients. This sample provided a power of 76% to detect a
reduction in the primary clinical outcome with a relative
risk of 0.6 (a 5 .05) for the whole group.
Statistical Methods

To validate exposure to vaccination, we calculated the j
statistic for data from electronic databases and data from
questionnaires. For the analysis of the association between
vaccine and clinical effects, including mortality, we
excluded patients who died during October and November 2010 (N 5 43), as we assumed they did not have the
opportunity to get vaccinated because of their end-stage
illness or death. We carried out the main analysis for the
total follow-up period. In a secondary analysis, we restricted the analysis of the primary outcome and other
infection-related complications to the period of peak
influenza activity: December 2010 to February 2011
4030

according to the Israel Center For Disease Control influenza summary report for 2010 to 2011.11 Restriction to
peak influenza activity period was performed to evaluate
the association between vaccination and relevant clinical
outcomes documented during the time influenza was
active to avoid dilution of the association with clinical
outcomes over a broader period.
Dichotomous data were compared using the chisquare test; and, for continuous data, we used the t test or
the Mann-Whitney U test, as appropriate. We computed
a propensity score for vaccination that was based on the
probabilities of a multivariable model with vaccination
status as the independent variable. We conducted a logistic regression analysis by including all baseline characteristic variables that had a significant association with the
outcome on univariate analysis (P < .05) as covariates,
including vaccination propensity. Variables were entered
into the logistic regression model using forward inclusion.
Age and vaccination status were forced into all models.
Finally, we conducted a vaccination propensity-matched
analysis (caliper 5 0.1).14 All data were analyzed using
SPSS software (version 20.0; SPSS Inc., Chicago, Ill).
RESULTS
Participants

We identified 1133 patients in the dispensation records of
the oncologic pharmacy unit. Of these, 849 patients were
included in the study cohort. Of the 849 patients, 561
consented to be interviewed, and 288 patients were
included in the study cohort without interview (Fig. 1).
Follow-up was complete for all 849 patients who were

included in the study cohort. Overall, 394 of 849 patients
(46%) were vaccinated. The j statistic for the vaccination
status between records and self-reporting was 0.87
(P < .001).
Baseline characteristics of the entire study population (N 5 849) by vaccination status are presented in
Table 1. The vaccinated patients were significantly older.
Low vaccination rates were observed in single/divorced/
separated patients (41 of 115; 35.6%) compared with
married patients (296 of 630; 47%) or widows/widowers
(57 of 104; 54.8%; P 5 .015). The vaccination rate in
hematologic patients was higher (115 of 201 patients;
57.2%) than in patients with solid malignancies, including those with colon cancer (65 of 139 patients; 46.8%),
lung cancer (29 of 67 patients; 43.3%), and other solid
tumors (101 of 228 patients; 44.3%); but the rate was significantly lower in patients with breast cancer (84 of 214
patients; 39.3%; P 5 .006). All past vaccination habits
differed significantly between groups: vaccinated patients
were more likely to have been vaccinated against influenza
in the past (P < .01), and more of them were vaccinated

against pneumococci (P < .01). A propensity score for
vaccination was calculated by including the baseline variables that were significantly associated with vaccination on
univariate analysis (Table 2). Variables that were included
in the final model included past influenza vaccination,
past pneumococcal vaccination, malignant disease risk,
time from diagnosis (up to or greater than 6 months),
country of birth (whether born in the former Soviet
Union). The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve for the model was 0.79 (95% confidence

Association Between Vaccination and Clinical
Outcomes

Patients who died during October and November 2010
(N 5 43) were excluded from analysis, as mentioned
above. The univariate analysis for clinical outcomes is presented in Table 3. There was no significant association
between vaccination status and the main outcome. The
analysis focusing on the peak influenza activity period is
also included in Table 3. In the main analysis, there was
no significant association between vaccination status and
the main outcome during peak influenza activity.
Of the secondary outcomes, the only significant
association was with mortality (46 of 387 vaccinated
patients [11.9%] vs 80 of 419 unvaccinated patients
[19.1%]; P 5 .005). During peak influenza activity, vaccinated patients had a trend toward fewer hospitalizations
(84 of 387 vaccinated patients [21.7%] vs 114 of 419
unvaccinated patients [27.2%]; P 5 .07), fewer hospitalization days (mean 6 standard deviation: 2 6 7.0 days in
vaccinated patients vs 2.5 6 6.5 days in unvaccinated
patients; P 5 .066), and less antibiotic treatment (35 of

Adjusted Analysis for Mortality

The variables that were included in the regression analysis
for mortality included the vaccination propensity score,
age, vaccination status, steroid treatment for >14 days,
type of cancer, malignant disease risk, and hospitalization
days in the year preceding the influenza season (October
4032

2009 to November 2010) (Table 4). The association
between vaccination status and mortality remained significant in the adjusted analysis (odds ratio [OR], 2.3; 95%
CI, 1.4-3.78; P 5 .001). Other independent risk factors
for mortality included steroid treatment for >14 days,
lung cancer, solid tumor cancers other than breast or colon (such as head and neck, pancreas, etc), hospitalization
days in the year before the influenza season, and high-risk
malignancy (Table 4). In this analysis, the area under the

Propensity-Matched Analysis

In the matched propensity analysis, each vaccinated
patient was matched with an unvaccinated patient.
Matching resulted in a cohort of 436 patients. Univariate
analysis results in this cohort were not different from the
results for the entire cohort, with mortality remaining the
only outcome significantly associated with vaccination.
On multivariable analysis of the propensity-matched
cohort (Table 5), the association between vaccination status and mortality remained significant (OR, 2.39; 95%
CI, 1.32-4.32; P 5 .004). Other independent risk factors
for mortality were similar to those in the main analysis,
except for hospitalization days in the preceding year,
which was not included in this model, and past influenza
vaccination, which was associated independently with
mortality (Table 5). In this analysis, the area under the
ROC curve was 0.81 (95% CI, 0.76-0.86; Hosmer and
Lemeshow test, P 5 .45)
Adverse Effects-Related Vaccine Administration

Of the 561 patients who were interviewed, 267 were vaccinated. Fifty-nine patients (24.6%) reported local and
other mild adverse events. Nine patients (3.3%) reported
fever related to vaccination.
DISCUSSION
Vaccination rates in our cohort were 46% (394 of 849)
among all patients and 48% (387 of 806) among the
patients who were alive on December 1, 2010. Patients
who had been vaccinated against influenza and StreptococCancer

cus pneumoniae in the past tended to get vaccinated again
in the studied winter (OR, 4.61; 95% CI, 3.22-6.59 for
influenza; OR, 2.81; 95% CI, 1.98-3.98 for S. pneumoniae). We observed an association between vaccination
and mortality, which remained significant after adjustment and propensity matching. With the optimal adjustment for confounding (adjusted analysis in the
propensity-matched cohort), the OR for death without
vaccination was 2.39 (95% CI, 1.32-4.32). We did not
observe an association between vaccination and the primary outcome or the other secondary outcomes. When
analyzing the association of vaccination status and influenza morbidity in the more relevant influenza activity period, there was a trend toward fewer hospitalizations,
fewer hospitalization days, and less antibiotic use in vaccinated patients.
Few previous studies have evaluated the association
of influenza vaccine and clinical outcomes in adult cancer
patients. One systematic review and meta-analysis of
influenza vaccine for immune-suppressed patients
addressed clinical outcomes, immunologic response, and
adverse events in cancer patients.15 Only 2 studies in pediatric cancer patients comparing vaccinated patients versus
placebo or no vaccine controls16,17 were included in the
meta-analysis of influenza-like illness incidence and demonstrated a statistically significant pooled OR of 0.26
(95% CI, 0.15-0.46; P < .001). Vaccine-related adverse
events that were evaluated from 31 studies were local or
systemic and were typically mild, and most studies
reported no statistically significant difference in adverse
event rates between vaccinated cancer patients compared
with vaccinated, healthy controls or unvaccinated controls. We performed a systematic review and meta4033

analysis to assess the clinical efficacy of influenza vaccines
in adult cancer patients using unvaccinated cancer
patients as controls.18 Only 3 studies were identified: In a
retrospective cohort study that assessed clinical outcomes
in patients with colorectal cancer (N 5 1255), influenza
vaccination was associated with an adjusted hazard ratio
(HR) for all-cause mortality of 0.88 (95% CI, 0.77-0.99),
fewer influenza-like illness episodes, and less laboratory
confirmed influenza.19 Another retrospective cohort study
that followed bone marrow transplantation recipients
(N 5 43) reported less microbiologically confirmed influenza among vaccinated patients compared with unvaccinated patients.20 A randomized controlled trial that
recruited patients with multiple myeloma (N 5 50; 25
vaccinated and 25 unvaccinated) indicated that, in the
vaccinated patients, there were significantly lower rates of
influenza-like illness episodes, pneumonia, and
hospitalization.21
Compared with previous studies, ours is the first
prospective cohort study with a large sample size to be
conducted among adults in which the relevant clinical
outcomes of influenza are compared between vaccinated
and unvaccinated cancer patients. Other strengths of our
study are a predefined prospective cohort and the use of
careful documentation in an electronic patient file to ascertain vaccinations and severe outcomes (such as hospital
stay and death).
The main limitation of our study is common to all
observational studies that examine interventions: we cannot be sure that we fully accounted for the factors that
influenced the patientsâ€™ and physiciansâ€™ decision to vaccinate. To address this bias, we performed both a multivariable regression analysis and a propensity-adjusted
analysis. Independent risk factors for death in our study
included high-risk cancers (including lung cancer, which
also was identified in other studies,22,23 and metastatic
solid cancer), chronic steroid treatment, and previous hospitalizations. However, the observed association between
vaccination and mortality may be confounded by other
factors we did not recognize or for which we could not
adjust. It is possible that vaccinated patientsâ€”those who
were regularly vaccinated before cancer diagnosisâ€”
received better health care in other dimensions as well
(healthy user effect). A recall bias may have influenced the
main outcome, because part of it was reported by the participants months after the event. Another limitation is
that the study was conducted in only 1 center, which
could limit the generalizability of the results. Death and
influenza-like illness are competing risks: patients who
died had a lesser chance of experiencing influenza-like ill4034

ness, and that may have biased our results toward equivalence in the primary outcome.
A randomized controlled trial that investigates the
clinical effectiveness of influenza vaccine in patients with
cancer is unlikely. Despite its weaknesses, the data from
our study favor a serious effort to increase the rate of influenza vaccination in patients with cancer.
