BACKGROUND: Cystectomy delay >90 days after a diagnosis of muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) adversely
affects pathologic stage and survival outcomes in patients who undergo primary surgery. After neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC), the impact of the timing of cystectomy delivery on these outcomes is uncertain. Poor communication
between urologic and medical oncologists can result in cystectomy delay after systemic treatment. The authors of
this report hypothesized that a delay in cystectomy delivery after NAC is associated with adverse survival outcomes.
METHODS: An eligible cohort of 153 patients with MIBC received NAC and underwent radical cystectomy between
1990 and 2007. At the authors’ institution, the genitourinary team strives to schedule patients for surgery at the time
of initial evaluation or after their first chemotherapy cycle. Clinicopathologic characteristics, including timing of cystectomy, chemotherapy delivery, vital status, and reasons for excessive surgical delay, were analyzed retrospectively
using an institutional database. A Cox proportional regression model was used to test the association between the
timing of cystectomy delivery and survival. RESULTS: The median follow-up for all patients was 3.6 years. The median
time to cystectomy was 16.6 weeks and 6.9 weeks from the first and last day of NAC, respectively. In multivariate
analyses, the timing of cystectomy delivery from the termination of NAC did not significantly alter the risk of survival.
The most common reason for cystectomy delivery beyond 10 weeks (28 patients; 18%) was procedural scheduling.
CONCLUSIONS: Cystectomy delivery within 10 weeks after NAC did not compromise patient survival and, thus, proC 2011 American
vided a reasonable window for patient recovery and surgical intervention. Cancer 2012;118:44-53. V

Historically, radical cystectomy has been the standard treatment for muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC).1,2

Multiple studies have suggested that a delay in undergoing cystectomy is associated with adverse outcomes.3-9 Specifically,
a cystectomy delay >3 months after a diagnosis of MIBC has been associated with local tumor progression3 and worsened
progression-free survival,6 cancer-specific survival (CSS),5 and overall survival (OS).5
More recently, randomized trials and a meta-analysis have demonstrated a survival advantage for cisplatin-based
neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) followed by radical cystectomy compared with cystectomy alone for the treatment of
MIBC.10,11 Outside of a clinical trial, the timing of cystectomy delivery after NAC can vary considerably, and a median
delay of 7 months after a diagnosis of MIBC has been reported by some large academic centers.12 The impact of cystectomy delay after NAC on survival currently is uncertain. Previous studies demonstrating adverse outcomes with cystectomy delay did not include patients who received NAC.3-5 A theoretical possibility of adverse outcomes exists for patients
who experience excessive cystectomy delay because of complications from NAC.13 However, delays also may result from
the administrative coordination of scheduling preparatory appointments, restaging evaluations, secondary opinions, and

the actual surgical procedure. A lack of communication
between the urologist and medical oncologist can occur
during a 3-month course of systemic therapy, particularly
when both practice in different institutions.
In this study, we analyzed the impact of the timing
of cystectomy delivery after NAC on survival in patients
with MIBC in a collaborative, multidisciplinary cancer
program at an academic tertiary care center. We specifically sought to define a range of cystectomy delivery that
would compromise CSS or OS. We hypothesized that a
substantial delay in cystectomy delivery would result in
adverse survival outcomes.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Cohort
We retrospectively analyzed data from an institutional
review board-approved institutional database. Between
January 1990 and December 2007, 1012 consecutive
patients underwent radical cystectomy for high-risk bladder cancer at the University of Michigan, including 621
patients (61%) who had MIBC or clinical evidence of
extravesical tumor without metastatic disease. Of these
621 patients, 166 (27%) received NAC without subsequent adjuvant chemotherapy. From this cohort, 13
patients were excluded from the current analysis, including 9 patients who had had pure nonurothelial histology,
2 patients who had a history of upper urinary tract cancer,
1 patient who withheld consent, and 1 patient who was
lost to follow-up. The remaining 153 patients formed our
study cohort.
Study Variables
Clinicopathologic parameters that were evaluated included
age, sex, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG)
performance status,14 American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score,15 American Joint Committee on Cancer
TNM staging before NAC (clinical stage) and after cystectomy (pathologic stage),16 histology and lymphovascular
invasion (LVI) at cystectomy, site of chemotherapy delivery (University of Michigan or other facility), chemotherapeutic regimen, and dates of initiation and termination of
systemic treatment. Pathologically, organ-confined bladder cancer was defined as lymph node-negative (N0) disease with Ta, tumor in situ (Tis), T1, or T2 tumors.
Extravesical disease was defined as pathologic T3 or T4
tumors or Tany tumors with lymph node invasion (Nþ).
Clinical staging before NAC was based on histologic
evaluation at the time a patient underwent transurethral

resection of bladder tumor, examination under anesthesia,
and a metastatic survey, including plain radiograph or
computerized tomography (CT) studies of the chest and
axial imaging of the abdomen and pelvis with CT or magnetic resonance imaging. Bone scans were performed for
bulky tumors, bone-related symptoms, or elevated alkaline phosphatase levels. Standard postoperative surveillance was performed.17
Determinants for a substantial delay in undergoing
cystectomy (10 weeks after treatment termination) were
gleaned from the patient record. Reasons for delay were
identified as patient factors (adverse health status from
toxicity or comorbidities, patient preference, multiple
opinions) or physician/institution factors (extended NAC
on or off protocol, scheduling delay).
Chemotherapeutic Regimen
The 3 most commonly used NAC regimens were combined paclitaxel, carboplatin, and gemcitibine (PCG)18
(paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 on Day 1, carboplatin at an area
under curve of 5 on Day 1, and gemcitabine 800 mg/m2
on Days 1 and 8 every 21 days for 3 cycles); combined
gemcitibine and cisplatin (GC)19,20 (gemcitabine 1000
mg/m2 on Days 1, 8, and 15 and cisplatin 70 mg/m2 on
Day 2 with cycles repeated every 28 days for 3 cycles); and
combined methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin, and
cisplatin (MVAC)10 (methotrexate 30 mg/m2 on Days 1,
15, and 22; vinblastine 3 mg/m2 on Days 2, 15, and 22;
doxorubicin 30 mg/m2 on Day 2; and cisplatin 70 mg/m2
on Day 2 repeated every 28 days for 3 cycles). Thus, most
patients would be expected to receive NAC for 9 to 12
weeks. The ‘‘miscellaneous’’ group included regimens
other than PCG, MVAC, or GC.
Statistical Analysis
The interval from the first and last day of NAC to radical
cystectomy was used to calculate the time to cystectomy
delivery from the initiation and termination of NAC,
respectively. CSS was defined as the time from cystectomy
to the time of death from bladder cancer, and OS was
defined as the time from cystectomy to the time of death
from any cause. Patients were censored at the date of last
follow-up if they were alive or had died from causes unrelated to bladder cancer (CSS) or if they were alive (OS).
Log-rank tests were used to assess the unadjusted difference in survival probability among patient groups
stratified by clinical parameters. Hazard ratios (HRs) with
95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using Cox
proportional hazards regression for this difference and for

multivariate analyses. By using a process of forward selection of covariates, a step-wise Cox regression analysis was
used to generate multivariate models to determine the
odds of CSS and OS. Of the 11 variables that were considered for model selection, 8 variables for CSS and 9 variables for OS met criteria for inclusion based on their
univariate significance (P < .5) or their clinical relevance
with univariate P values < .3. Kaplan-Meier estimates
were used to create survival plots. Comparisons of timing
of cystectomy delivery by NAC regimen were performed
using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test or the Kruskal-Wallis
test. Comparisons of survival between NAC populations
(miscellaneous vs all others) were performed using the
log-rank test.
To identify correlations between the timing of cystectomy delivery and survival, all possible delay points
were examined serially from the initiation and termination of NAC in weekly increments. Each assessment divided the cohort into 2 subsets (those with cystectomy
delivery greater than the cutoff point and those with cystectomy delivery less than or equal to the cutoff point).
Log-rank analyses then were used to detect any possible
difference in survival between the 2 subsets. A relevant
cutoff point was defined as one that resulted in a statistically significant survival difference between the 2 subsets
measured at that cutoff point and consistently at subsequent cutoff points. The 5% significance level was applied
to all tests and models. Analyses were performed using the
SAS statistical software package (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary,
NC).

RESULTS
Patient Demographics and Clinicopathologic
Parameters
Table 1 summarizes the cohort demographics of the 153
eligible patients. The mean age (64 years) and sex distribution (73% men) were similar to other retrospective series and randomized trials of patients with MIBC
undergoing cystectomy.10,21 The median follow-up was
3.6 years from cystectomy. The ECOG performance status before surgery was 0 in 94% of patients, reflecting
their suitability for cystectomy. In total, 76% of patients
received NAC at our home institution.
Patients typically received carboplatin-containing
(n ¼ 107; 69.5%) or cisplatin-containing (n ¼ 40;
26.1%) regimens, and only 6 patients (3.9%) did not
receive platinum-based therapy. Overall, 99 patients
(64.7%) received PCG, and 32 patients (21%) received

46

MVAC or GC, reflecting commitment to institutional
and national clinical trials,18,22 provider preference, or
compromised renal function. A fourth ‘‘miscellaneous’’
group consisted of 22 patients (14%) who received an
NAC regimen other than PCG, MVAC, or GC. Compared with patients who received PCG, MVAC, or GC,
patients who received a miscellaneous regimen did not
differ significantly in age (P ¼ .72), ECOG performance
status (P ¼ .49), or ASA score (P ¼ .63). Fourteen of
those 22 patients (64%) were treated at our institution,
and 16 (73%) received a platinum drug as part of their
treatment regimen.
At the time of cystectomy, the ASA score largely was
2 (51%) or 3 (46%), which demonstrated the presence of
a significant number of coexisting comorbidities within
this well performing population. A pathologic complete
response to NAC (pT0) was observed in 24% of the
cohort, and another 12% demonstrated non-MIBC
(NMIBC) and no lymph node metastases. One hundred
forty-four of 153 patients (94%) underwent pelvic
lymphadenectomy, and 23% of patients had lymph node
invasion. LVI status was available in 147 (96%) patients.
We observed evidence of LVI in 27% of tumors, a rate
that was lower than the rates reported in cystectomy-alone
series.21,23
Timing of Cystectomy Delivery
The median time to cystectomy delivery from the initiation of NAC was 16.6 weeks (range, 6.3-195.6 weeks;
25th and 75th percentiles, 13.9 weeks and 21.6 weeks,
respectively). The median time to cystectomy delivery
from the termination of NAC was 6.9 weeks (range, 1.7179.6 weeks; 25th and 75th percentiles, 5.3 weeks and
9.1 weeks, respectively). Pertinent variables were explored
to discern a potential association with cystectomy delivery
(Table 2). Advanced age (70 years), regimen type,
chemotherapy site, and advanced clinical stage did not
have an impact on the timing of cystectomy delivery.
Patients who had LVI, extravesical disease, or an incomplete treatment response did not have a longer time to cystectomy compared with patients who did not have LVI,
patients who had organ-confined tumor, or patients who
achieved a complete pathologic response, respectively.
The association between survival and the timing of
cystectomy delivery from the termination of NAC is summarized in Table 3 over Weeks 4 through 12. An analysis
of all evaluable time points at weekly intervals revealed no
difference in CSS or OS between those patients who were
treated at points longer than the delivery interval

compared with those who were treated at points less than
or equal to the delivery interval. Log-rank analyses of
delivery time points <4 weeks and >12 weeks included
subsets of 10% patients and, thus, were interpreted with
caution. A similar analysis of all evaluable time periods
(13-27 weeks) from the initiation of NAC to cystectomy
delivery also revealed no survival difference between
patients who were treated at points longer than the delivery interval compared with those who were treated at
points less than or equal to the delivery interval (data not
shown).
Cystectomy delivery occurred in 28 patients (18%)
10 weeks after the termination of NAC, reflecting the
population closest to the upper quintile with surgical
delay. The most common factor contributing to a prolonged time to surgery was ‘‘scheduling issues,’’ which
were observed in 11 patients (39%), including 7 patients
who were treated outside of our home institution. Adverse
health status because of patient comorbidity or toxicity
from NAC occurred in 3 patients (11%) and 4 patients
(14%), respectively. Elective delays in surgery related to
patient preference/multiple opinions (2 patients; 7%),
cystectomy refusal (6 patients; 21%), unknown factors (1
patient; 4%), or a combination of factors (1 patient; 4%)
occurred much less frequently.

Variables Impacting OS
The median OS was 2.6 years, and the 2-year and 5-year
survival rates were 57% and 38%, respectively. At the
time of the current report, the median CSS had not been
reached, and the 2-year and 5-year CSS rates were 60%
and 52%, respectively. In total, 2 patients (1.3%) died in
the perioperative period within 30 days of cystectomy.

year of surgery year were all associated with CSS in univar-

analysis. Although the type of chemotherapy regimen was
associated statistically with CSS and OS in univariate
analyses, there certainly were analytic limitations because
of the small numbers of patients receiving specific
regimens, particularly in the MVAC group. Secondary
analyses attributed the survival difference to the superiority of established regimens (GC and PCG) over the

‘‘miscellaneous’’ group with respective HRs of 0.24 (95%
CI, 0.10-0.61) and 0.45 (95% CI, 0.27-0.77). Multivariate models (Tables 4 and 5) demonstrated that pathologic
stage and year of surgery were the strongest predictors of
CSS, whereas pathologic stage was the strongest predictor
of OS. The timing of cystectomy delivery after NAC as a
continuous variable did not have an impact on CSS (HR,
0.97; 95% CI, 0.92-1.03; P ¼ .32) or OS (HR, 0.97;
95% CI, 0.93-1.01; P ¼ .24).
Optimal survival was observed among the patients
who achieved a complete pathologic response (pT0), with
2-year and 5-year OS rates of 80% and 63%, respectively
(Fig. 1); whereas the collective population with residual
disease had 2-year and 5-year OS rates of 49% and 29%,
respectively. Patients who had residual nonmuscle-invasive disease had more favorable survival rates compared
with patients who had residual muscle-invasive and extravesical disease (P ¼ .02) (Fig. 2). The 2-year and 5-year
OS rates were 68% and 53%, respectively, for patients
with lymph node negative NMIBC and 44% and 24%,
respectively, for the combined population of patients with
muscle-invasive and extravesical disease. There was no significant difference in the survival of patients with pT0N0
disease and those with pathologic NMIBC (P ¼ .33).

DISCUSSION
The current data demonstrate the feasibility of efficient
delivery of cystectomy after NAC for MIBC in a multidisciplinary group practice. The median time to cystectomy
from the termination of NAC was <7 weeks, and 80% of
the study cohort underwent cystectomy by 10 weeks. Age
did not have an impact on the timing of surgery. Patients
aged >70 years (34% of the cohort) underwent cystecCancer

January 1, 2012

tomy at a median of 6.7 weeks after the completion of
treatment and enjoyed an OS similar to that of younger
patients (aged <70 years). Systemic treatment at an outside institution did not delay cystectomy delivery or compromise survival. Furthermore, the timing of cystectomy
delivery did not appear to contribute to local disease progression, in that patients with higher pathologic stage
tumors had a time to cystectomy similar to that of patients
with organ-confined disease. Likewise, an incomplete
pathologic response could not be attributed to prolonged
time to cystectomy delivery. Despite the use of multiple
regimens in this study group, the timing of cystectomy
delivery after NAC across the various therapies was similar, with a median that ranged from 6.4 weeks to 7.1
weeks.
The majority of our patients (65%) received neoadjuvant PCG in keeping with ongoing institutional and
national clinical trials during the study period.18,22 These
trials certainly impacted general practice patterns at our
institution, because several patients received this regimen
off protocol. Consequently, only 21% of the cohort
received a standard cisplatin-based regimen. Moreover,
14% received alternative regimens generally because of
individual patient comorbidity. The resultant survival
outcomes in this cohort may be a reflection of the predominant use of carboplatin instead of cisplatin-based
regimens. The 2-year and 5-year survival rates of 57% and
38%, respectively, were lower than expected when considering the survival rates reported from randomized trials
that used primarily cisplatin-based neoadjuvant combinations before local therapy. For example, data from the
Advanced Bladder Cancer Meta-Analysis Collaborative
comparing randomized NAC and cystectomy with cystectomy alone suggested 2-year and 5-year OS rates of

and both were associated with superior survival outcomes
compared with patients who had muscle-invasive or extravesical disease.10 The frequency of pT0 after NAC varies

(7%-28% in single-center, retrospective studies using
MVAC or GC12,24; 18% in a multicenter phase 2 study
using PCG22; and 38% in a multicenter, cooperative
group, randomized controlled trial using MVAC10). The
pT0 rate of 24% in the current series is certainly a reflection of ‘‘real world’’ practice with the administration of different systemic regimens to a population of patients who
had a variety of social circumstances and comorbidities.
Although our population included high-performing
patients, nearly 50% of the study cohort had substantial
medical conditions, as evidenced by ASA scores of 3 or 4.
Our inclusion of these patient categories reflects the aggressiveness with which our group delivers NAC. Finally, an
important observation was the similar 2-year and 5-year
survival of patients with pT0 and residual NMIBC, suggesting that a finding of Ta, Tis, or T1 at cystectomy is of
great importance to this population. Consequently, the
presence of pathologic NMIBC after NAC is a relevant
endpoint that should be considered in NAC trials.
An assessment of the patterns of survival stratified
by the timing of cystectomy suggested similar survival
when cystectomy was delivered within 4 to 12 weeks after
the termination of chemotherapy. Although we did not
observe a survival disadvantage in the weeks before or after
this time period, these analyses had small cohorts of
patients; thus, the results must be interpreted with caution.
The patient numbers in the analyses up to and including
10 weeks after NAC termination were more robust, permitting greater confidence in deeming this a safe window
for cystectomy delivery after NAC. Although we strive to

deliver cystectomy as expeditiously as possible after NAC,
there is potential benefit in permitting some patients an
additional 1 to 3 weeks to recover from systemic therapy.
In that context, we can be more confident that a brief delay
up to 10 weeks after NAC is unlikely to compromise CSS
or OS. The data evaluating survival patterns from the initiation of chemotherapy resulted in similar conclusions.
Delays in surgery beyond 10 weeks after NAC termination certainly are possible because of complications
from systemic treatment, patient indecision, and/or coordination of care between medical oncology and urology.
Within our study population, the 28 patients (18%) who
underwent cystectomy at or beyond 10 weeks generally had
delays because of procedural scheduling. Adverse health status related to patient comorbidity or NAC toxicity also was
an important cause of surgical delay, whereas delays caused
by patient preference or multiple opinions were infrequent.
It is worthwhile to note that scheduling issues occurred disproportionately in those who were receiving NAC outside
of our institution, emphasizing the need for good communication and planning. Still, we did not observe a survival
disadvantage for patients who were treated outside our facility; thus, treatment away from the home institution should
not dissuade the use of NAC before cystectomy.
Although the findings from this study are interesting, they are limited by the retrospective nature of the
study and because the data were compiled from a single
center with potentially unique patient referral and practice
patterns. We specifically identified patients who received

NAC and were able to undergo radical cystectomy,
because our intent was to evaluate the timing of cystectomy delivery. Consequently, we did not collect data on
patients who initiated NAC but did not undergo cystectomy because of either treatment-related toxicity or death,
patient refusal, or disease progression.
In conclusion, concerns regarding the use of NAC
have been attributed in part to apprehension over the timing of cystectomy delivery after systemic treatment. Our
data demonstrate the feasibility of timely cystectomy
when a neoadjuvant strategy is used to treat MIBC, even
when therapies are administered at different institutions.
It is noteworthy that, should unanticipated actions delay
surgery, then cystectomy delivery up to a period of 10
weeks after the termination of NAC is unlikely to compromise patient survival. Active communication between
treating physicians facilitates surgical scheduling and minimizes treatment delays and patient uncertainty.
