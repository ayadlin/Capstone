ABSTRACT
Though metastatic cancers often initially respond to genotoxic therapeutics,
acquired resistance is common. In addition to cytotoxic effects on tumor cells, DNA
damaging agents such as ionizing radiation and chemotherapy induce injury in benign
cells of the tumor microenvironment resulting in the production of paracrine-acting
factors capable of promoting tumor resistance phenotypes. In studies designed to
characterize the responses of prostate and bone stromal cells to genotoxic stress,
we found that transcripts encoding glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF)
increased several fold following exposures to cytotoxic agents including radiation,
the topoisomerase inhibitor mitoxantrone and the microtubule poison docetaxel.
Fibroblast GDNF exerted paracrine effects toward prostate cancer cells resulting in
enhanced tumor cell proliferation and invasion, and these effects were concordant
with the expression of known GDNF receptors GFRA1 and RET. Exposure to GDNF
also induced tumor cell resistance to mitoxantrone and docetaxel chemotherapy.
Together, these findings support an important role for tumor microenvironment
damage responses in modulating treatment resistance and identify the GDNF signaling
pathway as a potential target for improving responses to conventional genotoxic
therapeutics.

INTRODUCTION

includes fibroblasts, vascular cells, nerve cells, and various
components of the immune system. DNA damage to TME
cells can lead to the activation of secretory programs
which in turn influence the growth and resistance behavior
of tumor cells [5].
In studies designed to characterize transcriptional
alterations in primary prostate fibroblasts following
DNA damage, we previously identified more than 40
transcripts that encode secreted proteins with the potential
for exerting paracrine effects on adjacent tumor cells [6].
This cohort of secreted proteins included Glial Cell lineDerived Neurotrophic Factor (GDNF). GDNF was first
described as a trophic factor for dopaminergic neurons
of the rat midbrain [7]. Additional trophic effects on
various other neuronal subpopulations have subsequently
been described: GDNF acts as a morphogen in kidney
development and it is a key component regulating

Prostate cancer-related mortality is primarily caused
by metastatic disease, a disease stage that initially shows
high response rates to androgen deprivation therapy (ADT)
but subsequent progression to a clinical state termed
castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) [1-3]. Current
treatment options for CRPC include DNA damaging
regimens (genotoxic chemotherapy and radiation) but
their impact on overall survival remains limited [4] and
CRPC is almost invariably fatal. DNA damaging regimens
are not selective to prostate cancer cells but also affect
other normal cellular components that exist in the tumor
microenvironments (TME) of organs and tissues. The
spectrum of benign cells comprising the TME varies
between tumors located at the primary site and those that
have disseminated to distant metastatic sites, but generally

the spermatogonial stem cell niche and the cellular
proliferation of spermatogonial stem cells [8, 9]. These
effects are signaled via a receptor multimer that comprises
the RET transmembrane-receptor in conjunction with
GNDF-family co-receptors, mainly the alpha 1 type
(GFRA1). Activated GDNF/GFRA1/RET complexes
signal via the SRC/ERK, RAS/MAPK and the PI3K/
PKB pathways in a cell context-dependent manner [8]. A
RET independent pathway that is responsive to GDNF via
GFRA1 and SRC family kinases (SFK) has been reported
thereby uncoupling an obligate requirement for RET
expression in mediating GDNF effects in target cells [10].
GDNF has been shown to be elevated in prostate
cancer reactive tumor stroma where it is hypothesized to
contribute to tumor growth and invasion [11]. Sympathetic
and parasympathetic innervation of the prostate is linked
to poor clinical outcome in prostate cancer patients by
inducing early phase tumor development and late stage
tumor dissemination [12]. GDNF has well established
functions as a neuro-trophic factor and as a neurite
guidance cue [13], but whether GDNF affects the
innervation pattern of prostate cancers after genotoxic
treatment is not known, and such an effect would likely
be evident long after exposures, a scenario not directly
relevant to clinical realities in metastatic disease. However,
GDNF could have comparable trophic effects on prostate
cancer cells and stromal cells as seen in neurons and other
tissues, with acute effects on prostate cancer growth and
treatment resistance.
The fact that GDNF is up-regulated in prostate
tumor stroma in various settings and given the wellestablished function of GDNF as a trophic factor in
multiple different tissues types, we hypothesized that
GDNF secretion by the TME upon DNA damage could
actively influence prostate cancer cellular responses and/
or growth properties, and thereby modify their sensitivity
to cytotoxic, cytostatic or pathway-directed therapeutics.
We report here that genotoxic treatments induce
GDNF secretion in both prostate fibroblasts and bone
fibroblasts, which consequently induces prostate cancer
cell proliferation and treatment resistance. These effects
correlate with the expression levels of GFRA1 receptor
in the cancer cells. GDNF stimulation activates the
SRC/ERK pathway and induces RB and E2F1 mediated
transcriptional changes. GDNF has treatment counteracting effects in prostate cancer cells which may limit the
efficacy of DNA damaging strategies for treating localized
and advanced prostate cancers.

DNA damage induces GDNF secretion in
stromal cells comprising the prostate tumor
microenvironment
We previously profiled the gene expression
alterations in prostate fibroblasts following DNA damage
and identified a spectrum of highly induced transcripts
of which a subset encoded secreted proteins including
GDNF [6]. To confirm and quantify these findings in
independent experiments, we exposed PSC27 prostate
myofibroblasts [14] to agents known to cause DNA
damage: 0.6 mM H202, 10 μg/ml bleomycin, 100 nM
mitoxantrone and 10 Gy radiation (IR). We confirmed the
induction of DNA damage in the treated cells by assessing
the phosphorylation status of serine 139 on H2A histone
family, member X (γ-H2AX), indicative of DNA double
strand breaks (Fig 1A). We also treated PSC27 fibroblasts
with the microtubule poison docetaxel, a chemotherapeutic
widely used in the treatment of advanced prostate cancer.
Exposure to 50 nM docetaxel also resulted in DNA
damage with γ-H2AX phosphorylation detected at levels
roughly equivalent to that observed with IR (Fig 1A),
a finding concordant with previous findings showing
docetaxel induces DNA damage, though indirectly via
replication-mediated double strand breaks [15, 16]. Using
microarray-based methods to quantitate gene expression
alterations we determined that GDNF expression increased
substantially (> 6-fold) regardless of the agent used to
induce DNA damage (Fig 1B). To determine the temporal
pattern of GDNF up-regulation after DNA damage, we
measured GDNF transcript levels by qRT-PCR from one
to 16 days post treatment and observed a gradual increase
in GDNF transcripts over time, from 2.5-fold at 5 days
to 5-fold by 16 days after IR, and from 3.5-fold to 11.5fold after mitoxantrone treatment (p<0.001) (Fig 1C, D).
However, when analyzing the amount of intracellular
GDNF protein in prostate fibroblasts after these treatments
by ELISA, protein induction to above detection limit
was found as early as five days post exposure, and the
concentration did not further increase over time despite
further increases in GDNF transcript levels (Fig 1E),
suggesting that GDNF protein may be secreted. We also
compared GDNF transcript levels by microarray analysis
in micro-dissected cancer-associated stromal tissue before
and after exposure to chemotherapy in men with prostate
cancer enrolled in a neoadjuvant clinical trial combining
mitoxantrone and docetaxel [17, 18]. In the majority of
cases analyzed (7/10), GDNF transcripts were elevated
after therapy in these paired clinical samples (Fig 1 F)
consistent with the findings in cultured prostate fibroblasts.

DNA damage-induced GDNF secretion exerts
autocrine effects on prostate fibroblasts

the CM of control cells. However, after treatment with
IR, docetaxel, or mitoxantrone, GDNF was measureable
in the CM at physiologically relevant concentrations (>
5 ng/ml) (Fig 2A). The same effect was observed when
analyzing cell lysates of PSC27 fibroblasts after treatment,
with substantial GDNF protein measurable in all three
treatment conditions (Fig 2B). Collectively, these results
demonstrate that clinically relevant treatment regimens
induce the transcription, translation and secretion of
GDNF in prostate fibroblasts.
GDNF can activate multiple down-stream signaling
cascades via its known receptors RET and GFRA1 [8]. To
determine if GDNF acts in an autocrine/paracrine loop via
one of these pathways, we analyzed their activation state

As GDNF exerts its biological function as a
secreted ligand, we next analyzed the effect of DNA
damaging treatments on GDNF secretion. As the tumor
microenvironment is comprised of tumor cells and
benign constituents including fibroblasts, we determined
whether GDNF exhibits paracrine and/or autocrine
effects toward this abundant benign cell type. We treated
PSC27 fibroblasts with three DNA damaging regimens
and measured GDNF secretion to the culture medium
(CM) by ELISA. We were unable to detect GDNF in

in PSC27 cells before and after exposure to exogenous
GDNF. To generate a model isolating the effect of GDNF
amongst the amalgam of secreted factors induced by
DNA damage, we generated PSC27 cells over-expressing
GDNF by viral transduction. These PSC27-GDNF-V5
cells showed substantially increased levels (>10-fold) of
GDNF in cell lysates and in the conditioned CM compared
to PSC27-EGFP-V5 control cells (Fig. 2C D). We treated
PSC27 fibroblasts with 100 ng/ml purified human
recombinant GDNF (hrGDNF) as well as conditioned
medium from PSC27-GDNF-V5 cells. Stimulation with
GDNF led to the activation of SRC kinase which is
known to be an effector kinase downstream of GFRA1.
Additionally, we found the ERK pathway to be activated
after GDNF stimulation but not AKT, indicating that
GDNF activates selective down-stream pathways in
prostate fibroblasts (Fig 2E). GDNF exposure also
resulted in the activation of S6 kinase indicating that
GDNF stimulation could have pro-proliferative and pro-

survival effects. To test this possibility, we analyzed
the replicative potential and proliferation rates of cells
exposed to GDNF. PSC27 cells are primary prostate
fibroblasts with limited replicative potential. These cells
can be grown for 18 to 19 passages before undergoing
replicative exhaustion and/or cell senescence after which
they no longer proliferate. PSC27 control cells (PSC27EGFP-V5) underwent replicative growth arrest after 18
passages, whereas PSC27 cells expressing GDNF (PSC27GDNF-V5) underwent replicative growth arrest after 26
passages (Fig 2F). Stimulation of low passage PSC27 cells
with intact proliferative potential showed that GDNF also
significantly enhanced their proliferation rate (> 2-fold,
p<0.001) (Fig 2G). Together, these data show that cancer
therapeutics, such as IR or chemotherapy, to which tumor
microenvironment cells are often exposed, induce GDNF
secretion in these tumor microenvironment cells which
then stimulates the stromal cells in an autocrine/paracrine
loop via the SRC/ERK pathway.

Bone marrow fibroblasts secrete GDNF following
DNA damage but lack autocrine GDNF responses

protein production as measured by a GDNF specific
ELISA (Fig 3A, B). To isolate GDNF effects from the
spectrum of other damage-induced factors, we generated
GDNF over-expressing cell lines for HS5 and HS27a cells
(Fig 3C, D). The proliferation rates of the GDNF overexpressing bone fibroblast lines did not differ from the
control cells (data not shown). Subsequent analysis of the
signaling pathways which are known to be down-stream
of GDNF and which were activated in prostate fibroblasts,
such as SRC and ERK phosphorylation, did not show
any activation in HS5 or HS27a cells (Fig 3E). There
were also no changes in AKT phosphorylation status or
activation of down-stream S6 kinase, indicating that the
bone stromal cells, unlike prostate fibroblasts, are not
sensitive to autocrine/paracrine stimulation with GDNF,
despite the fact that they do substantially increase GDNF
expression after genotoxic damage. While exposure to

DNA damaging regimens are used focally in the
case of radiation to the primary site or discrete metastatic
foci, regionally in the case of bone-directed radioisotopes
such as RAD-223, and systemically when using genotoxic
chemotherapeutics for the treatment of CRPC which often
metastasizes to bone [19]. To determine if DNA damaging
regimens also induce GDNF in benign cells residing in
the bone marrow niche, we measured GDNF expression
after treatment with IR (10 Gy), docetaxel (1 nM) and
mitoxantrone (100 nM) in two bone stromal cell lines (HS5
and HS27a, [20]). In both cell lines, GDNF was below
detection limit in control settings. However, exposure to
IR, docetaxel, or mitoxantrone strongly induced GDNF

GDNF did not produce changes in SRC, ERK and S6K

the tumor microenvironment could exert effects toward
prostate cancer cells at the primary site and at the
predominant site of metastasis. We therefore sought to
determine if GDNF influenced prostate cancer phenotypes
of growth, invasion, and resistance to cancer therapeutics.
To determine the sensitivity of prostate cancer to
GDNF, we exposed a spectrum of prostate cancer cell
lines to GDNF and monitored cell proliferation over a
period of 3-5 days. Four cell lines (M12, 22Rv1, M2205,
PC3) showed significant increases in cell numbers and
proliferation when exposed to GDNF (1.5- to 3-fold)
while two cell lines (DU145, LNCaP) where insensitive
to GDNF stimulation (Fig 4A). GDNF signaling is
mediated via the cell surface receptors RET and GFRA1,
with distinct downstream pathway connectivity [8]. To

corresponded to the expression pattern of either of these
receptors, we analyzed the expression levels of RET as
well as of the GFR-alpha receptor family genes. GFRA1
is the predominant GDNF receptor, but contributions
from other family members have been reported [8]. There
was a clear correlation between GDNF sensitivity of the
prostate cancer cell lines and GFRA1 expression levels
which separated the four sensitive lines from the nonresponsive lines (Fig 4B). The cells with the strongest
response also had the highest levels of RET, excepting
PC3 cells which only showed limited expression of
RET while still being sensitive to GDNF, indicating that
GFRA1/SRC signaling could be the predominant pathway
involved. There was no noticeable correlation between
GDNF sensitivity and expression of any of the other
GFR-alpha family members (Fig 4B). This expression
pattern of high GFRA1 and moderate or absent RET and
GFRA2-4 was also found in the GDNF sensitive PSC27
cells (Supplementary Fig S1A). Next, we analyzed the
activation status of the GFRA1/SRC/ERK pathway in
the sensitive and insensitive cell lines. Responsive cells
showed increased SRC phosphorylation and elevated
levels of activated ERK while insensitive cells did not
(Fig 4C). Stimulation with GDNF did not induce AKT
activation in any of the prostate cancer lines analyzed
(data not shown), consistent with the findings in prostate
and bone stromal cells (Fig 2E; Fig 3E). Together, these
findings indicate that prostate cancer cells expressing
GFRA1 respond to GDNF stimulation with the activation
of the SRC/ERK pathway and increased mitotic rates.
The cell lines with the strongest response to GDNF also
had the highest expression levels of RET, indicating that
this effect could be enhanced by co-expression of both
receptors. Adding GDNF neutralizing antibodies (NAb) to
conditioned medium of stromal cells with induced DDSP
reduced the pro-proliferative effect in CaP epithelial cells
(Supplementary Fig S1B).
We analyzed publicly available data at The Human
Protein Atlas data repository [21, 22] to determine the
expression patterns of RET and GFRA-family members
in clinical prostate cancer. The majority of prostate cancers
expressed GFRA1 (82%) and all tumors showed RET
expression (Fig 4D), indicating that a majority of localized
prostate cancers are potentially sensitive to GDNF.
GDNF is a major regulator of directed neurite
growth [23], indicating that it also could have effects on
the migratory and invasive behavior of prostate cancer.
To test this hypothesis, we analyzed the effect GDNF has
as a chemo-attractant in trans-well invasion assays in the
same cell lines used in the proliferation study. The four
cell lines expressing GFRA1 (M12, 22Rv1, M2205, PC3)
showed significant increases in migration and invasion
after 24h (130-135%, p < 0.01), whereas the two cell
lines with low or absent GFRA1 (DU145, LNCaP) did not
exhibit any significant changes (Fig 4E). To control for
the possibility that the difference in invasiveness could be
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

caused by GDNF pro-proliferative effects, we measured
changes in cell numbers after 24 hours of GDNF exposure
and found no significant differences in this time frame
(Supplementary Fig S1C). Overall we observed a growth
promoting and pro-invasive influence of GDNF toward
prostate cancer cells. These effects correlated with the
expression of GFRA1, but not necessarily with RET or
GFRA2-4. Cells responding to GDNF showed activation
of the SRC/ERK pathway.

GDNF enhances prostate cancer resistance to
genotoxic chemotherapy
The changes in cell proliferation and the activation
of the SRC/ERK pathway in prostate cancer cells upon
stimulation with GDNF indicated that GDNF could also
have an effect on the survival of prostate cancer in the
context of cancer-directed therapeutics. We stimulated
prostate cancer cells with 100 ng/ml hrGDNF and cotreated them with either 50 nM of docetaxel or 100 nM
mitoxantrone. After an incubation period of 5 days we
analyzed the number of viable cells comparing treatments
with or without GDNF exposure. In the context of
docetaxel treatment, the addition of GDNF enhanced
the viability of all cell lines tested, excepting DU145
(Fig 5A). The DU145 effects are consistent with a lack
of proliferation and invasion responses to GDNF and
reflect the absence of RET and GFRA1 receptors that
would mediate these responses (Fig 4B). In the context
of mitoxantrone, GDNF enhanced the cell viability to
the greatest extent in those cell lines with the highest
GFRA1 expression, M12 and M2205 (1.7-fold and 2.6fold, p<0.05) whereas the survival of cells with low to
absent GFRA1, such as DU145, was not enhanced (Fig
5B). However, the survival of LNCaP cells which express
very low levels of RET and GFRA1, was enhanced by
GDNF despite not having shown increases in proliferation
or invasion. The mechanism underlying this response has
not been established. These findings indicate that GDNF
secretion upon DNA damage could directly influence
the response rate and effectiveness of prostate cancer
therapeutics and thereby contribute to acquired treatment
resistance.

GDNF induces distinct gene expression programs
in prostate cancer cells and prostate fibroblasts
GDNF produced substantial changes in the
phenotypes of both prostate epithelial and stromal cells.
GDNF is known to regulate cellular behavior across
a spectrum of tissues by indirectly influencing gene
expression [8, 24, 25]. To identify the gene expression
programs influenced by GDNF we used whole-genome
microarrays to quantitate transcript abundance levels
before and after GDNF exposure. We isolated RNA
2140

from M12 prostate epithelial cells and PSC27 prostate
fibroblasts stimulated with 100 ng/ml hrGDNF for 48h
in chemically defined culture medium. In M12 cells,
763 transcripts increased and 291 decreased following
exposure to GDNF (FDR q≤0.01). In PSC27 fibroblasts,
735 transcripts increased and 383 decreased (FDR
q≤0.01). Comparisons across the two cell lines identified
95 up-regulated and 25 down-regulated genes common to
both gene sets (FDR q≤0.01). We performed unsupervised
sample clustering based on these expression profiles. The
primary attribute driving the sample grouping was cell
type (Fig 6A) followed by absence (control) or presence
of GDNF stimulation (Fig 6B, C) in both cell lines.
We next sought to identify any regulatory networks
and known interaction pathways that would provide an
indication of the collective effects of GDNF in these cell
types. Using the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis algorithms
[26] we found a strong and highly significant correlation
with the disease areas of ‘Cancer’ and ‘Muscular
Disorders’ with strong enrichment of pro-survival and proproliferation functions. These effects could be narrowed
down to ‘cell cycle progression’, ‘cellular growth and
proliferation’, and ‘cell death and survival’ networks
thereby confirming that the biochemical and phenotype
changes we observed in vitro were also reflected in
changes of global gene expression. Using these findings

as an internal control for the quality and relevance
of the transcript profiles, we next aimed to identify
transcriptional regulators mediating the effect of GDNF
stimulation on the target cells.

GDNF regulates genes comprising RB1-, E2F1and AR-target gene clusters
To determine how GDNF stimulation of epithelial
and stromal cells leads to the observed changes in
overall gene expression and identify which transcription
regulators possibly mediate this effect, we matched the
GDNF-associated gene expression profiles to the targetgene patterns of known transcription factors. Ingenuity
algorithms produce positive or negative activation
z-scores that indicate if the target genes of a specific
regulatory entity, in this case a transcription factor,
correlates with activation or inhibition. We grouped the
transcription factors based on the combined activation
score in fibroblasts and epithelial cells with cutoffs at
2 > z > -2 and a p-value of p < 0.05 corresponding to
those transcription factor target groups that are strongly
induced or repressed (Fig 6D). The cohort of transcription
factors with reduced activity included several members
of the retinoblastoma family (Fig 6D). A previous study

identified the retinoblastoma (RB1) tumor suppressor as
a regulator of prostate cancer progression in a sub-set of
CRPC cases [27]. RB1 loss was shown to activate the
transcription factor E2F1, which subsequently augmented
androgen receptor (AR) activity. The combined effect of
cell cycle deregulation via RB1 and E2F1 and of AR reactivation was hypothesized to promote prostate cancer
progression to castration resistance. Interestingly, E2F1
targets were among the most significantly activated genes
after GDNF stimulation (Fig 6D). The initial combined
analysis of carcinoma cells and fibroblasts did not identify
AR targets as significantly altered. However, when
analyzing the data for the cancer cells independently,
the reduction of the RB gene expression signature (z =
-2.46) and activation of the E2F1 signature (z = 2.34)

were confirmed, and activation of the AR signature
(z = 2.99) was significant (Fig 6E). Prior studies have
reported that RB1 levels affect the AR occupancy of
select gene enhancer sequences [27]. We evaluated the
transcript levels for genes putatively affected by RB1AR interactions and found that several genes, including
CDK1 and CCNA2, were up-regulated following GDNF
exposure while others (ANAPC10) were not (Fig 6F),
indicating that the RB1-AR effect only targets a subset
of the target genes, potentially in a tissue specific manner.
Together, these data indicate that GDNF stimulation is
associated with reduced RB activity and enhanced E2F1
and AR target gene expression in a subset of prostate
carcinoma that are receptive to GDNF signaling by virtue
of RET and/or GFRA1 receptor expression.

DISCUSSION

this effect by increasing the pool of actively proliferating
cells during and after genotoxic treatment cycles. ERK
signaling is known to interfere with multiple pathways
regulating apoptosis [31] and blocking Caspase-3
activation [32] as well as inducing DNA damage repair
genes in CaP cells [33], offering direct molecular links
between GDNF and the observed phenotypes. However,
increased proliferation, elevated drug tolerance, and
modified apoptosis signaling are likely to be gradual
variations of a single continuous effect, the activation of
pro-mitotic signaling within the target cell.
Tumor repopulation by treatment-resistant
circulating tumor cells (CTC) has been suggested as one
mechanism for rapid recurrence and treatment failure [34].
GDNF acted as a chemo-attractant to prostate cancer cells
in our experiments. Consequently, as bone stromal cells
secrete GDNF upon DNA damage, they could act as an
attractant to viable CTCs in the circulation, an effect that
would add to the pro-survival responses of GFRA1/SFK
activation by promoting the homing of resistant prostate
cancer cells to a microenvironment with augmented progrowth and resistance-inducing properties. In the prostate
itself, GDNF-induced chemotaxis of prostate tumor cells
could induce cell migration to areas of sustained viability
and niches with more favorable growth conditions after
genotoxic insults. This effect could be even further
enhanced by GDNF inducing re-innervation and revascularization of the particular niche after radiation
therapy.
GDNF is best described as a neuro-trophic factor
with strong chemotactic potential on neurite growth and
directionality [13] and it maintains the spermatogonial
stem cell niche in rodents in a regulated, pro-proliferative
state [9]. A local source of GDNF in the tumor stroma
could therefore act as an additive factor in TME
remodeling and survival after therapy. Prostate fibroblasts
showed strong responses to GDNF by increasing their
proliferative rate and delaying cell senescence in vitro.
A combined effect of increased stromal cell survival
and enhanced TME remodeling post-treatment could
have considerable influences on the dynamics of tumor
treatment resistance and repopulation by maintaining a
favorable niche for tumor cells to survive and proliferate
within, particularly in the case of radiation therapy
where sufficient time for vast tissue remodeling and reinnervation is available. As autonomic innervation has
been shown to correlate with disease progression in
prostate cancer [12], GDNF could exert adverse indirect
effects via it’s known neurotrophic activities.
Overcoming acquired treatment resistance has the
potential to arrest disease progression and considerably
improve overall outcomes in patients with metastatic
cancers. DNA damage induces a DNA damage secretory
program (DDSP) comprised of tens to hundreds of
paracrine-acting proteins that are capable of influencing
tumor growth, survival, and resistance to therapy. While

Studies of tumor responses to genotoxic treatments
often demonstrate initial cytotoxic effects and tumor
regressions, but subsequent tumor progression with
accelerated rates of tumor cell repopulation. Several
mechanisms appear to underlie treatment resistance,
making targeted intervention to circumvent resistance
challenging and multi-dimensional [28]. Treatment
pressures, such as chemo- or radio-therapy, will select for
pre-existing neoplastic sub-clones with elevated resistance
levels [29]. Subsequent cell populations derived thereof
will retain these characteristics and gradually increase
treatment resistance with repeated selection/therapy
cycles. Additionally, exposure to treatment can induce
or increase the expression levels and activity of adaptive
resistance mechanisms, such as the up-regulation of MDR
genes, activation of DNA repair mechanisms or switching
of the predominant metabolic pathways [30]. These
effects render the tumor cells less sensitive to treatment
conditions and can act in concert with the effect of subclonal selection.
Treatment failure and tumor repopulation are not
exclusively mediated by cancer cell intrinsic mechanisms.
Paracrine interactions with the tumor stroma and microenvironment have been described with resistanceenhancing effects [6], adding an additional layer of
complexity. The cancer-TME interaction can be mediated
via the ECM and direct cell-to-cell contacts for short
range interactions, or via soluble biologicals acting across
multiple tissue layers. The tumor micro-architecture
influences critical aspects of treatment sensitivity,
such as intra-tumoral pressure/edema, innervation or
vascularization. Multiple levels of treatment resistance that
include cell intrinsic mechanisms, paracrine interactions
between tumor and stroma, and the micro-architecture of
the TME could be substantially affected by the induction
of GDNF following genotoxic damage.
GDNF is up-regulated and secreted by stromal cells
that reside in the prostate and the bone marrow, indicating
that both primary lesions and metastases could be
stimulated by GDNF in various different treatment settings
that span localized irradiation of the primary lesion and
systemic chemotherapy for widely metastatic disease.
Specifically, GDNF stimulation increases the proliferation
rate of prostate cancer cells. This effect correlates with
the expression level of GFRA1, but not with those of
RET, and signaling seems to occur via the GFRA1/SFK
pathway. The majority of prostate cancer patient samples
analyzed show GFRA1 protein expression, indicating that
increased cell proliferation upon GDNF secretion in the
TME and therefore expedited tumor repopulation and
clonal outgrowth could contribute to treatment failure in a
considerable proportion of prostate cancer cases. The fact
that GDNF reduces the sensitivity of prostate cancer to
commonly used treatment regimens could further enhance

it is attractive to consider specific therapeutics directed
toward inhibiting the effects of GDNF in the context of
standard cancer therapeutics, the DDSP is comprised
of additional factors that have the potential to promote
resistance phenotypes. Understanding the upstream
regulatory mechanisms that contribute to the secretion
of GDNF and other DDSP components could provide
strategies for suppressing the DDSP more broadly, and
thereby limit the treatment counter-acting effects exerted
by a damaged tumor microenvironment.

For conditioned cell culture medium analysis, the
medium was replaced with serum free medium for 4-6
days, collected and concentrated using centrifugal filter
units (Millipore, UFC900324). For lysate analysis, the
same lysates were used as for western blots (see above).
ELISA was performed according to the manufacturer’s
instructions (Promega, G7621) in at least triplicate dilution
series. Concentrations were calculated based on the GDNF
reference standard curve and adjusted for background
signal with 0.25 on the arbitrary scale corresponding
to approximately 100 ng/ml of GDNF in the analyzed
sample.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Western Blot

qRT-PCR
Cells were washed once in 1x PBS before lysis in
1% SDS (Fisher, BP166), 1% NP-40 (Sigma, 74385), 2%
Tween-20 (Fisher, BP337), 1.5M urea (Fisher, BP169)
in PBS. Lysates were collected with a cell scraper and
heated to 95°C for 5min. DNA was sheared using a small
gauge syringe. For sub-cellular fractionation, cells were
lysed in 1% NP-40, 10% Glycerol (Fisher, BP229), 2mM
EDTA (Fisher, BP120), 137mM NaCl (Fisher, BP358),
20mM TrisHCl (Promega, H5123) in H20, pH adjusted
to 8.0, and nuclei pelleted by centrifugation. Nuclei
were then lysed in the high urea lysis buffer and treated
as described above. All lysis buffers were supplemented
with phosphatase inhibitors (phosSTOP, Roche, 04 906
837 001) and stored at -20°C.
Electrophoresis was performed on 4-12% gradient
gels (Novex, NP0321) using MES SDS buffer (Invitrogen,
NP0002-02). Transfer was performed on a semi-dry
transfer unit (Amersham, TE 70) using Tris/CAPS buffer
(BioRad, 161-0778) and 0.2μm nitrocellulose membranes
(Novex, LC2000). Membranes were pre-blocked in 5%
non-fat milk, 1% BSA (Sigma, A3294-100G) in PBS-T,
and labeled with primary or secondary antibody in 1%
BSA PBS-T. Primary antibodies used were: V5-Tag	
(Invitrogen, R960-25), p-Src (Cell Signaling, 2101S), Src
(Cell Signaling, 2110S), p-Akt (S473) (Cell Signaling,
4058S), p-Akt (T308) (Cell Signaling, 4056S), Akt (Cell
Signaling, 9272S), p-Erk1/2 (T202/Y204) (Cell Signaling,
4370), Erk1/2 (Cell Signaling, 9102), p-S6K p70 (Cell
Signaling, 9204S), S6K p70 (Cell Signaling, 9202S),
GAPDH (GeneTex, GTX627408), TurboGFP (Thermo
Scientific, PA5-22688), γ-H2AX (GeneTex, GTX11174),
and actin (Cell Signaling, 4970S).
Secondary antibodies were Goat derived IgG
coupled to HRP (Pierce, 31460, 31402, 31430).
Chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce, 34080) was used for
visualization on light sensitive film (Thermo Scientific,
34093).

The following sequences were used for GDNF
specific primers: fwd. TCC CAT TCA GAG AAC CTT
GGC AGT; rev. ACC TGC TTG TGG TGT GTA GGT
GAT. Expression levels were normalized to the expression
signal of GAPDH in all experiments. qRT-PCR reactions
were performed using ‘Power SybrGreen’ on an Applied
Biosystems (Foster City, CA) 7900HT Fast Real-Time
PCR System according to manufacturer’s instructions.
Reaction cycling conditions consisted of a 10’ incubation
at 95°C followed by 40 cycles of 95°C for 15 seconds
with a one minute extension phase at 60°C. Product
disassociation curves were generated using the machines
default conditions.

Cell Counting and Viability Assay
The cells were counted and analyzed for viability
with a ‘ViCELL XR’ automated cell counter (Beckman
Coulter) and analyzed with the ‘ViCELLXR 2.04.004’
software according to manufacturer’s instructions. In
short, cells were suspended by trypsination and collected
in RPMI 1640 containing 10% FBS to stop the enzymatic
reaction. The cells were then analyzed in the cell counter
which uses trypan blue exclusion to determine sample cell
viability. Cells were treated as indicated in the text. For
GDNF neutralization assays the following antibodies were
used: mouse anti GDNF (R&D, Cat # MAB212, 5ug/ml)
and Goat anti GDNF (R&D, Cat # AF-212-NA, 2ug/ml).
Conditioned medium of PSC27 cells irradiated with 10
Gy was collected. Neoplastic prostate epithelial cells were
stimulated in a mix of serum free medium and conditioned
medium 1:1 in the presence (NAb) or absence (CTRL) of
GDNF NAb.

Cell Invasion Assay

experimental samples were amplified two rounds using the
Ambion MessageAmp aRNA Kit (Ambion Inc, Austin,
TX), according to the manufacturer’s specifications.
cDNA probe pairs were prepared by aminoallyl
reverse transcription using 2 μg of amplified RNA and
labeling with Cy3-dCTP or Cy5-dCTP fluorescent dyes
(Amersham Bioscience, Piscataway, NJ). Experimental
and reference probes were combined and competitively
hybridized to Agilent Human 4x44K microarrays under a
coverslip for 16 h at 63°C. Fluorescent array images were
collected for Cy3 and Cy5 emissions using a GenePix
4000B fluorescent scanner (Axon Instruments, Foster City,
CA). Image intensity data were extracted and analyzed
using GenePix Pro v4.1.1.44 software. Log2 ratios were
normalized using the printtiploess function from the
Limma package in R. The data-sets were uploaded to
Ingenuity Pathway Analysis Software Platform for further
analysis, including activation scores and pathway analysis.

Cell invasion was analyzed using the ‘CultureCoat
96 well Low BME Cell Invasion Assay’ (CULTUREX,
Cat# 3481-096-K) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. The cells used in the assay were starved
for 48h in serum free culture medium prior to seeding.
Serum free medium was used as a control condition for
base line invasiveness, 10% FBS RPMI 1640 was used
as a positive control, and 100ng/ml human recombinant
GDNF (hrGDNF, R&D Systems, 212-GD-050) in serum
free RPMI was used in the experimental set. The assay
plates were read on a ‘Synergy 2’ plate reader (BioTek)
and analyzed with ‘Gen5’ software (BioTek).

Cell Line Generation and Culture Conditions
Prostate cancer cell lines M12, 22Rv1, M2205, PC3, DU145 and LNCaP were obtained from the American
Type Culture Collection. PSC27 prostate myofibroblast
cells were generated by Dr. Beatrice Knudsen [14].
Hs5 cells and Hs27a cells were kindly provided by Dr.
Beverly J. Torok-Storb. All cells were used within 8
passages after receipt or were authenticated by matching
transcript profiles of the cells used in these experiments
with transcript profiles generated from the cell stocks
originally provided or from public gene expression
datasets corresponding to the specific cell line in order
to confirm the identity of the cell line. Epithelial CaP
cells and Hs5 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 with
10% FBS. Hs27a cells were maintained in DMEM with
10% FBS. PSC27 cells were grown and maintained as
described earlier [14]. PSC27, Hs5 and Hs27a cells were
transduced with viral particles when at 50% confluence
in the presence of 6 μg/ml ‘Polybrene’. Transduced
cells were selected for at least 14 days using 5 μg/ml
of Blasticidin. Cells were analyzed for GDNF-V5 overexpression by both Western blot, using the V5-antibody,
and by GDNF specific ELISA.

Patient Stromal Cell Isolation
Stromal cells were isolated from patient-matched
tumor biopsies before and after chemotherapy treatment
using an Arcturus (Veritas Microdissection) laser capture
microscope. The criteria for selecting captured stromal
cells were as follows: the stroma had to be adjacent to
cancerous glands and epithelial cells to select for cancer
associated stromal cells. Additionally, a safety margin of
about 10 cells from the basal membrane was applied to
prevent contamination with epithelial cells. The purity of
stromal cells collected by LCM was later confirmed by
qRT-PCR with stroma-specific markers and epithelium
markers, respectively, with the former much higher
than the latter (minimum of 15 cycles’ difference).
Approximately 3000 stromal cells were collected per
sample. RNA isolation and array experiments were
performed as described above.
