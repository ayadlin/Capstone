BACKGROUND. Letrozole is safe and effective in postmenopausal women with
estrogen receptor-positive early breast cancer, but long-term aromatase inhibitor use may cause bone loss and increase fracture risk. This study evaluated
an immediate or delayed strategy of bone protection therapy with zoledronic
acid.

METHODS. A total of 1065 patients who were receiving adjuvant letrozole were
randomized to immediate-start or delayed-start zoledronic acid (4 mg intravenously biannually for 5 years). The delayed group received zoledronic acid if
lumbar spine or total hip T-score decreased below 22.0 or when a nontraumatic
fracture occurred. The primary endpoint was change in lumbar spine bone
mineral density (BMD) at Month 12. Secondary endpoints included changes in
total hip BMD, serum bone turnover markers, and safety at Month 12.

RESULTS. Lumbar spine BMD increased from baseline in the immediate arm,
while it decreased from baseline in delayed-arm patients. At Month 12, the differences between the groups in lumbar spine and total hip BMD were 5.7%
(P < .0001; 95% confidence intervals [CI], 5.2% to 6.1%), and 3.6% (P < .0001;
95% CI, 3.3 to 4.0%), respectively. Both regimens were well tolerated with few serious adverse events. Bone pain was higher in the immediate group, as expected,
because some patients experienced acute-phase reactions after zoledronic acid
infusion.

loss in postmenopausal women who were receiving adjuvant letrozole. Cancer

ciated with premature bone loss.2 In postmenopausal
women with breast cancer, aromatase inhibitors (AIs)
result in a nearly complete suppression of aromatase
activity and a fall in circulating estrogen concentrations to undetectable levels.3,4 In the adjuvant setting,
all third-generation AIs are associated with further
acceleration of bone loss and an increased rate of
bone fracture, compared with tamoxifen or placebo.5–8
Efforts to avoid fractures are needed. In the Arimidex, Tamoxifen, Alone or in Combination (ATAC)
trial, the fracture risk increased during therapy but
returned to normal after stopping anastrozole.9 Maximal bone mineral density (BMD) loss occurs during
the first year after treatment-induced menopause or
initiation of an AI, making the concept of bone preservation during this time an important area of
study.10
Fracture risk is evaluated in this study through
the use of a surrogate endpoint, change in BMD. Several studies have shown that BMD is a strong surrogate marker for fracture risk in postmenopausal
women.11,12 A meta-analysis of approximately 39,000
men and women participating in 12 osteoporosis
trials reported a 1.6-fold to 2.2-fold increase in fracture risk for each standard deviation (SD) fall in
BMD T-score for women.13 (A T-score uses the
young-normal standard of optimal or peak density of
a 30-year old healthy adult rather than age-matched
comparisons of BMD).
The use of an AI, either alone or sequentially after tamoxifen, is emerging as the optimal adjuvant
endocrine therapy for postmenopausal women with
hormone receptor-positive breast cancer. Compared
with tamoxifen alone, AIs have improved disease-free
survival and produced fewer gynecological or thromboembolic adverse events. Strategies to prevent bone
loss, particularly in women using such therapy after
chemotherapy or a premature menopause, are
needed. The Austrian Breast and Colorectal Cancer
Study Group trial 12 (ABCSG-12) reported a 17.3%
loss in BMD in premenopausal patients with early
breast cancer who were receiving anastrozole and a
luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist after 36 months of treatment.10 Zoledronic acid,
a nitrogen-containing bisphosphonate, inhibits
osteoclast-mediated bone resorption and maintains
or increases BMD.14 Recent data have also indicated
that women with established postmenopausal osteoporosis, receiving an annual 5 mg dose of zoledronic
acid, experienced a 70% risk reduction in new spine
fractures (P < .0001) and a 40% risk reduction in hip
fractures (P 5 .0032).15
The aim of the ZO-FAST trial was to evaluate
the effect of either immediate or delayed use of

4 mg zoledronic acid on the prevention of bone
loss in both recently postmenopausal (because of
chemotherapy or LHRH suppression) and established postmenopausal women with early stage
breast cancer who had received adjuvant letrozole
for 5 years.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Patients
Postmenopausal women from 112 centers in 28
countries who had estrogen receptor-positive early
breast cancer and baseline lumbar spine (LS) and
total hip (TH) T-scores above 22.0 were included.
Eligibility criteria was similar to the Z-FAST study.16
Study Design
In this open-label, multicenter, randomized study,
patients orally received 2.5 mg letrozole daily for 5
years or until disease progression and were randomized to intravenously receive immediate or
delayed 4 mg zoledronic acid for 15 minutes every 6
months for 5 years. The immediate group received
zoledronic acid after randomization, whereas the
delayed group received zoledronic acid when 1)
postbaseline spine or hip T-score decreased to
below 22.0; 2) a nontraumatic clinical fracture
occurred; or 3) asymptomatic fracture was discovered at the Month-36 scheduled visit. Patients were
instructed to take an oral calcium supplement (500
mg) and a multivitamin tablet containing vitamin D
(400 IU to 800 IU) daily during the study. Patients
were stratified according to adjuvant chemotherapy
(yes vs no), baseline T-score (normal, T-score above
21.0, or T-score between 21.0 and 22.0), and menopausal status (recently postmenopausal vs established postmenopausal).
The primary endpoint of this study was the percentage change in spine BMD at 12 months in
patients who were receiving immediate-start compared with delayed-start zoledronic acid. The secondary endpoints included the percentage change in
total hip (TH) BMD, changes in serum N-telopeptide
(NTX), and bone-specific alkaline phosphatase
(BSAP) concentrations at 12 months. BMDs of the
spine and hip were evaluated at baseline, 6 months
(optional), and 12 months, and will be evaluated at
24, 36, and 48 months, and at the final visit by using
either Hologic (Hologic, Bedford, Mass), Lunar (GE
Medical Systems Lunar Corporation, Madison, Wis),
or Norland (Norland, Fort Atkinson, Wis) dual-energy
x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) devices. T-scores were
calculated by using manufacturer-specific T-score
databases. All DXA devices were standardized and

Zoledronic Acid Prevents Bone Loss/Bundred et al.

cross-calibrated by using 4 Bio-Imaging Bona Fide
Phantoms (CIRS Tissue Simulation & Phantom Technology, Norfolk, Va). Enrollment eligibility and timing
for initiation of zoledronic acid in the delayed group
were based on local DXA readings; however, a central
reader (BioImaging, Leiden, Netherlands) analyzed
all DXA scans for the primary analysis. Patients with
baseline and Month-12 spine BMD measurements
were included in the BMD efficacy analysis. BMD
data were not available for all patients for the Central
Reader. This was primarily due to technical reasons
at both the site and at the Central Reader. Also, some
patients were not compliant. This affected both baseline and Month-12 assessments. These problems
caused some of these patients not to be included in
the analysis of BMD data. However, these women
were included in the adverse event summary.
Serum NTX concentrations, measured by using
the Osteomark and Wampole NTX assays (Wampole
Laboratories, Princeton, NJ), and BSAP concentrations, measured by using the Metra immunoassay
(Quidel Corporation, San Diego, Calif), were evaluated in a subset of patients by a central laboratory
(CRLMedinet Laboratory, Inc., Breda, Netherlands) at
baseline and every 3 months during the first year
and will be measured every 6 months during years 2
to 3, once at 48 months, and at the final visit. The
samples were obtained in the morning while patients
were fasting. The normal range for NTX is 6.2 nmol
BCE/L to 19.0 nmol BCE/L for all age groups, including postmenopausal women. The BSAP normal range
for postmenopausal women is 14.2 U/L to 42.7 U/L.
Adverse events and disease progression were evaluated every 6 months. Adverse events were graded by
using the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity
Criteria (NCI-CTC), version 3.0.17 Serum creatinine
levels were measured at baseline, every 6 months,
and at the final visit. Lipid levels were collected on a
subset of patients.
The ethics committee at each participating institution approved this study. Informed consent was
obtained from each patient before enrollment. The
study was funded by Novartis Oncology (East Hanover, NJ). The steering committee directed the 12month data review and analysis; all data analyses
were performed by PRA International, Mannheim,
Germany.

Statistical Analysis
The study design used a 2-sample Student t test,
with a power of 90% and a significance level of
P 5 .05, to detect a 4% difference in percentage
change in spine BMD with a standard deviation of
18% from baseline to 12 months between the

1003

groups. A sample size of 427 patients per treatment
arm was required. To allow for a 5% dropout rate, at
least 450 patients in each treatment arm were
required.
Unless otherwise specified, all statistical tests
were performed by using a significance level of
P 5 .05 against a 2-sided alternative hypothesis.
Analyses of BMD and bone markers were based on
the intent-to-treat (ITT) population, which comprised all randomized patients. Analyses related to
cancer recurrence used a modified ITT (mITT)
population, defined as all randomized patients who
underwent at least 1 postbaseline assessment. The
safety population included all patients who received
at least 1 dose of zoledronic acid or letrozole. Analyses of adverse events and clinical fractures used the
safety population according to randomized treatment. More detailed analyses (including subset analyses) related to bone health, including BMD, NTX,
and BSAP, used the safety population according to
treatment received. Patients who discontinued the
study early were instructed to return for a final
assessment of BMD, serum NTX, and BSAP concentrations, and adverse events 4 weeks after treatment
cessation.
The primary analysis was performed after all
patients had passed the 12-month visit. An analysis
of covariance (ANCOVA) model, with adjuvant chemotherapy use and region as factors and baseline
BMD and years since menopause as covariates, was
used to compare differences between groups; Student t tests for paired data were used to compare differences within treatment groups in spine and hip
BMD and serum NTX and BSAP concentrations from
baseline to Month 12.
The study was not designed or powered to detect
a difference in the incidence of clinical fractures or
breast cancer relapse. The frequency of adverse
events is reported for both groups.

RESULTS
Study Population
Between May 2003 and August 2004, 1065 patients
were randomized by 112 centers in 28 countries to
receive either immediate or delayed zoledronic acid
(Fig. 1). The baseline characteristics of the 2 groups
were similar (Table 1).
Screening failures were collected as a part of the
automated patient randomization system and 446
screens were reported. The reasons were unacceptable test procedure result, including low-baseline
BMD score, 289 (65%); other, 50 (11%); patient withdrew consent, 37 (8%); patient did not meet the diag-

laboratory value, 22 (5%); unacceptable past medical
history and/or concomitant diagnosis, 16 (4%); unacceptable use of excluded medication and/or therapies, 4 (1%); intercurrent medical event, 4 (1%); and
unknown, 2 (0.5%).
Of the 1065 randomized patients, 1 patient did
not undergo the postbaseline assessment because
she withdrew consent. The demographics of the
patient population are shown in Table 1.
In the delayed arm, 75 patients had started zoledronic acid by the time of the 12-month analysis. Of
these, 54 were started based on the lumbar or hip
BMD T-score falling to less than 22, and 1 patient
had experienced a nontraumatic clinical fracture.
Twenty patients were started because of misunderstanding of the protocol at the site level.

Bone Mineral Density
For lumbar spine (L1-L4) BMD, in the ITT population, the unadjusted mean percentage change from
baseline in the immediate arm was 2.1%, and in the
delayed arm, it was 23.5%. Both of these mean
changes were significantly different from zero
(P < .0001). At Month 12, the adjusted (leastsquares) mean percentage difference in BMD
between the 2 groups was 5.7% at the spine

(P < .0001; 95% confidence interval [CI], 5.2–6.1)
and 3.6% at the hip (P < .0001; 95% CI, 3.3–4.0),
respectively (Fig. 2). Similar results were seen for
the safety population, for lumbar spine (L2-L4) with
an adjusted mean percentage change from baseline
in the immediate arm of 1.9% (95% CI, 1.6–2.2)
compared with 23.1% (95% CI, 23.5 to 22.8) in the
delayed arm (P < .0001).
In the recently postmenopausal women included
in the safety population, immediate zoledronic acid
prevented BMD loss at both L2-L4 lumbar spine and
TH with an adjusted mean percentage change of
20.2% (95% CI, 21.1 to 0.7) and 0.07% (95% CI,
20.6 to 0.7)at 12 months, respectively, whereas in
those randomized to delayed intervention, decreases
in BMD of 5.5% (95% CI, 26.3 to 24.7) and 3.4%
(95% CI, 24.0 to 22.8) at the lumbar spine and TH
at 12 months, respectively, were seen (P < .0001)
(Fig. 3). These results show a trend toward more
rapid bone loss in the recently postmenopausal
women versus established postmenopausal women.
This is demonstrated by looking at the delayed arm
in the 2 groups. The losses in BMD are 25.49 in the
recently postmenopausal group versus 22.61 in the
established postmenopausal group.
At baseline, 737 (69.2%) patients had normal
spine BMD (370 patients, 69.5% in the immediate

Baseline BMD data for 17 patients in the immediate group and 24 patients in the delayed group were not transferred to or could not be read by central reader from study sites; therefore, they not included in
the analysis.

Fractures
During the first year, the incidence rate of fractures
was similar, with 8 (1.5%) patients in the immediate
group and 9 (1.7%) patients in the delayed group.
Breast Cancer Recurrence
Twelve (2.3%) patients suffered distant recurrences in
the immediate group as did 11 (2.1%) patients in the
delayed group. There were 4 deaths in the immediate
arm and 5 deaths in the delayed arm due to breast
cancer relapse.

Serum NTX and BSAP concentrations were measured
in a subset of 293 patients with baseline characteristics similar to the entire study population. By Month
12, the unadjusted mean of percentage change from
baseline in serum BSAP concentrations had decreased
significantly (P < .0001) in the immediate group
(215.5%) and increased significantly (P <.0001) in the
delayed group (30.1%). The difference between the immediate and delayed groups in unadjusted mean percentage change from baseline of the bone turnover
markers at Month 12 was 45.6% (P < .0001) for serum
BSAP (Fig. 4).
The prespecified endpoint for NTX results was
the percentage change from baseline at Month 12.
The assay used to determine NTX results changed
during the course of the study. The 2 assays were
not standardized against each other. Therefore, the

phatase (BSAP) concentrations from baseline in women with early stage
breast cancer administered immediate or delayed zoledronic acid. Treatment
difference in unadjusted mean percentage change in BSAP from baseline to
12 months is 45.6%; P < .0001).

ability to interpret the magnitude of the change
from baseline is limited. Nevertheless, given that
treatments were randomized, the magnitude of the
treatment difference on absolute NTX scores may
still be meaningful, and the P value for the significance of the treatment difference is meaningful. In
fact, the use of 2 different assays would have the
effect of increasing variability of the treatment difference, which would tend to reduce statistical significance. Then, a statistically significant difference
would be a robust finding. The unadjusted mean

BCE/L for the immediate group and 30.3 (9.50)
nmol BCE/L for the delayed group, for a mean treatment difference of 7.5. As a result, the NTX concentration is, on average, 33% higher in the delayed
arm than in the immediate arm. The value for the
treatment difference, comparing the 2 groups on
computed percentage change from baseline is
P < .0001.

Safety
Adverse events having an incidence of at least 5% in
either treatment group are shown in Table 3. The
occurrence of adverse events was similar between
the groups with the exception of bone pain, which
was higher in the immediate zoledronic acid group
(12.3% vs 6.9%) than the delayed group, as expected,
because of the acute-phase reaction that is known to
occur in some patients after zoledronic acid infusion.
Only 2 patients experienced renal impairment, and
both cases were unrelated to study medication as neither had started zoledronic acid at the time of the event.
Serious adverse events occurred in 8.2% and
6.7% of patients in the immediate and delayed
groups, respectively. Withdrawal from the study due
to adverse events occurred in 5.3% of patients in the
immediate group and 4.7% in the delayed group;
1.5% and 1.0% of patients in the immediate and
delayed groups, respectively, discontinued therapy
because of serious adverse events.
The mechanism between osteonecrosis of the
jaw and treatment regimens including bisphosphonates has not been established. Although, osteonecrosis of the jaw was not specifically defined in the
protocol, the study database was searched for

1007

adverse events that could capture this type of event.
The search identified 1 patient. This patient who
had been randomized to the immediate arm had
experienced a delay in dental healing (grade 2) of 60
days duration. The event was suspected to be related
to the study medication; however, no action was
taken, and the event resolved without study drug
interruption.

DISCUSSION
Adjuvant AI therapy administered either alone for 5
years, or sequentially after 2 to 5 years of adjuvant
tamoxifen, improves disease-free survival in postmenopausal women with endocrine-responsive breast
cancer when compared with tamoxifen alone for 5
years.5–8,18 In general, AIs are associated with a favorable safety profile with fewer thromboembolic and
gynecological adverse events than are seen with tamoxifen. However, uniformly reported disadvantages
of AIs compared with tamoxifen therapy are the development of accelerated bone loss (decline in BMD) and
increased fracture risk.19
Bisphosphonates are an attractive solution for
the prevention of cancer treatment-associated bone
loss in postmenopausal women with early breast
cancer. Zoledronic acid is the only compound that
has been extensively studied and has proven efficacy
in the context of AI-associated bone loss.16 The rates
of bone loss in the presence of an AI are approximately 5-fold higher than those observed in postmenopausal women with established osteoporosis in
the absence of AI therapy. This difference led to the
dose selection of 4 mg every 6 months in cancer
patients.20
The fracture efficacy of zoledronic acid has been
demonstrated in women with established postmenopausal osteoporosis, who received an annual 5 mg
infusion of zoledronic acid.15 Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that there would be fracture efficacy
in the population with AI-associated bone loss treated with zoledronic acid on a slightly more frequent
schedule of 4 mg every 6 months.
Recently, the first results from the Z-FAST study
demonstrated that patients who received immediate
zoledronic acid every 6 months were less likely to
develop clinically significant bone loss at 1 year than
women who received delayed. zoledronic acid.16
We have confirmed these results in the ZO-FAST
study with an increase in BMD in the immediate
zoledronic acid group compared with a significant
reduction in BMD in the delayed zoledronic acid
group. Recently postmenopausal patients with
chemotherapy or LHRH analog-induced menopause

have a higher rate of bone loss when combined with
AI therapy. This was demonstrated on the delayed
arm. In recently postmenopausal women had a
BMD decline of 25.49 versus 22.61 in the established postmenopausal women. The immediate
strategy of zoledronic acid 4 mg every 6 months was
able to maintain BMD at both the spine and the hip
(Fig. 3).
The ABCSG-12 trial10 studied premenopausal
patients who were undergoing treatment with an
LHRH analog (goserelin) and randomized to either
tamoxifen or the AI, anastrozole, with or without
zoledronic acid, to assess the long-term bone safety
of the combined hormonal treatment. BMD change
was used to define the efficacy of zoledronic acid.
This study confirmed that early combined hormonal
therapy-induced menopause resulted in very substantial bone loss, mainly evident during the first 12
months of treatment. The magnitude of BMD loss
was more pronounced with the combination of
goserelin 1 anastrozole
than
with
goserelin
1 tamoxifen but was effectively prevented by immediate administration of zoledronic acid.10
The ZO-FAST study shows that there are postmenopausal women who are at significant risk of
developing severe osteopenia within the first year of
AI therapy in the delayed zoledronic acid treatment
group. All of these patients with a mild degree of
osteopenia at the commencement of letrozole are
less able to compensate for the increased bone turnover and consequent bone loss associated with AI
therapy. By Month 12, 10% of patients in the delayed
group required commencement of zoledronic acid
because of a fall in BMD with a T-score less than
22.0.
Only 17 fractures were noted in this analysis, 8
in the immediate arm and 9 in the delayed arm. We
did not expect to see a significant difference in fractures at this time because of the short follow-up and
the number of patients enrolled. Analysis of fractures
and breast cancer recurrence data will be closely
monitored for 5 years.
This trial defined the cutoff point for entry BMD
to a T-score of greater than 22. Sixty-five percent of
screening failures could not be enrolled for this reason. Therefore, patients with severe osteopenia or
osteoporosis at the initiation of adjuvant AI therapy
represent a significant patient population. The optimal way to maintain bone health in such patients
remains an important clinical issue.
The changes in bone marker measurements
observed in a subset of patients who were receiving
immediate versus delayed zoledronic acid suggest
that the effect of zoledronic acid on bone turnover is

both rapid and sustained over at least the first 12
months. The mean of percentage change from baseline in BSAP significantly decreased in the immediate
zoledronic acid treatment group but significantly
increased in the delayed treatment group. In our
study, the unadjusted mean difference in BSAP concentrations between the immediate and delayed
treatment groups was 8.9 U/L at Month 12. From a
bone safety viewpoint, although BSAP was suppressed in the immediate group, the mean concentrations at each time point remained within the
normal premenopausal reference range, which is
consistent with continued and active bone remodeling (Fig. 4).
Zoledronic acid was generally well tolerated,
with few discontinuations in either group. Bone
pain, pyrexia, and headache, which are consistent
with the acute-phase reaction that is known to
occur in about 30% of the patients who receive zoledronic acid infusion, were more common in the immediate than in the delayed group, but the intensity
of such adverse events was mild to moderate. Only
2 patients experienced renal impairment, which was
not related to study medication. The reported occurrence of osteonecrosis of the jaw in women with
advanced breast cancer receiving chronic monthly
intravenous bisphosphonates, among other therapies, is an infrequent event. The incidence of this
complication has not been determined prospectively, but current estimates suggest an overall frequency of about 1%.21,22 To date, no suspected
cases of osteonecrosis of the jaw were reported in
this study.
National Osteoporosis Foundation (NOF), World
Health Organization (WHO), and the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) have published
guidelines for the management of osteoporosis.2,23,24
The WHO guidelines recommend treatment for
patients when their T-score is less than or equal to
22.5 or for osteopenic patients with additional
strong risk factors.2 NOF recommends treating
patients when their T-score is less than 22.0 with no
risk factors or if the T-score is greater than or equal
to 21.5 with 1 or more risk factors or a prior vertebral or hip fracture.23
ASCO recommends that all women at high risk
of osteoporosis, including women who are receiving
AI therapy, undergo baseline assessment of BMD and
regular follow-up while on treatment.24
The 12-month results of this ongoing clinical
trial suggest that initiation of intravenous 4 mg
zoledronic acid every 6 months in postmenopausal
breast cancer patients receiving adjuvant AI therapy
is an effective treatment to prevent bone loss. It is

Zoledronic Acid Prevents Bone Loss/Bundred et al.

particularly appropriate for those women with
osteopenia at baseline because they have a significant risk of developing osteoporosis during treatment with an AI. Women recommended for AI
therapy who have additional risk factors for fracture, such as advanced age, prior history of fracture
as an adult, and personal or family history of osteoporosis, may be best managed by an immediate
rather than a delayed bone protection strategy. For
women with normal BMD at baseline scheduled to
receive an AI, the risk of developing osteoporosis
appears to be low. No patients in the ATAC study or
Intergroup Exemestane Study bone subprotocols
who commenced AI therapy with normal BMD
became osteoporotic while on treatment.25,26 In the
ZO-FAST study, follow-up is short, but the risk of
transition from normal to severe osteopenia also
appears to be very low. At the time of this primary
analysis (12 months), no patients with normal BMD
at baseline had developed severe osteopenia, even
in the absence of bone protection with zoledronic
acid.
Longer follow-up is needed to determine
whether the bone loss observed in the delayed group
can be stabilized or restored to baseline values with
the subsequent administration of zoledronic acid.
The 2-year, 3-year, and 5-year results of this trial and
other ongoing clinical trials are necessary to further
assess the impact on BMD loss and fracture rates in
patients with early stage breast cancer who are
receiving long-term adjuvant AIs.
