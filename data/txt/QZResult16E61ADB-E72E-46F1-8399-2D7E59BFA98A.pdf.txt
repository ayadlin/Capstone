ABSTRACT
Mutations or deregulated expression of the components of the spliceosome can
influence the splicing pattern of several genes and contribute to the development
of tumors. In this context, we report that the spliceosome modulator sudemycin
induces selective cytotoxicity in primary chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells
when compared with healthy lymphocytes and tumor cells from other B-lymphoid
malignancies, with a slight bias for CLL cases with mutations in spliceosome-RNA
processing machinery. Consistently, sudemycin exhibits considerable antitumor
activity in NOD/SCID/IL2Rγ-/- (NSG) mice engrafted with primary cells from CLL
patients. The antileukemic effect of sudemycin involves the splicing modulation
of several target genes important for tumor survival, both in SF3B1-mutated and
-unmutated cases. Thus, the apoptosis induced by this compound is related to the
alternative splicing switch of MCL1 toward its proapoptotic isoform. Sudemycin
also functionally disturbs NF-κB pathway in parallel with the induction of a spliced
RELA variant that loses its DNA binding domain. Importantly, we show an enhanced
antitumor effect of sudemycin in combination with ibrutinib that might be related to
the modulation of the alternative splicing of the inhibitor of Btk (IBTK). In conclusion,
we provide first evidence that the spliceosome is a relevant therapeutic target in CLL,
supporting the use of splicing modulators alone or in combination with ibrutinib as a
promising approach for the treatment of CLL patients.

median survival of less than 4–5 years [1, 2]. These clinical
differences are largely associated with the mutational status
of the variable region of immunoglobulin heavy chain genes
(IGVH), cytogenetic alterations and expression of ZAP-70,
CD38 or CD49d [3, 4].
In the last years, whole-genome and exome
sequencing have revealed the presence of novel recurrent
somatic mutations with functional impact in CLL patients.
These studies have uncovered genetic alterations that

INTRODUCTION
Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is the most
frequent adult leukemia in western countries. The tumor
is characterized by the proliferation and progressive
accumulation of distinctive mature clonal B lymphocytes in
blood, bone marrow and lymphoid tissues. The prognosis of
the patients is highly heterogeneous; while some show an
indolent disease, others follow an aggressive course with a

tend to cluster in different pathways, including Notch
signaling, RNA splicing and processing machinery, innate
inflammatory response, Wnt signaling and telomere
maintenance [5–8]. SF3B1 is among the most frequently
mutated genes in CLL affecting up to 5–18% of patients
[6, 8, 9]. This gene encodes a core component of the
spliceosome, the machinery that catalyzes the removal of
introns from precursor mRNAs and ensures the fidelity
of the process. Consistent with the crucial role of this
pathway in CLL, mutations in other genes of the mRNA
splicing, processing and transport machinery are also
found to be frequently mutated in CLL patients [10].
Clinically, SF3B1 mutations provide independent
prognostic information from the other known CLL
prognostic markers. Such mutations correlate with a more
aggressive behavior of the disease, rapid tumor progression,
poorer clinical outcome and shorter time to treatment as well
as treatment refractoriness [6, 8, 9, 11–13]. Consistently,
SF3B1 mutations are mostly subclonal events in CLL, and
therefore likely involved in disease progression [14].
Besides mutations, overexpression of the components
of the spliceosome has been found in cancer, as a result,
targeting this machinery has been proposed as a relevant
therapeutic target [15]. In this context, several bacterial
natural products have been described that target SF3B1
and modulate RNA splicing, including FR901464 and
pladienolide B, which induce antitumor activity in different
tumor types [16, 17]. Additionally, the pladienolide
derivative E7107 entered clinical trials for solid tumors.
However its development has been significantly hampered
due to the structural complexity of the molecule [18, 19].
A novel set of totally synthetic analogs of FR901464, the
sudemycins, have demonstrated cytotoxicity toward several
human tumor models, including lymphoma, both in vitro
and in xenograft models [20–22].
Therefore, the spliceosome is an important emerging
target for CLL therapy that has recently been uncovered
but remains to be significantly exploited. Herein, we
evaluate for the first time the antitumor effect of the
spliceosome modulator sudemycin in SF3B1-mutated and
-unmutated CLL cells in the in vitro and in vivo settings.
Moreover, we investigate the molecular mechanisms
underlying the antitumor effect of sudemycin in these
cells and explore the effects of its combination with the
clinically relevant BTK inhibitor, ibrutinib.

D1 [22]. Cytotoxicity was measured after incubation of
CLL cells with 100, 250 and 500 nM of drugs for 24 hours
(Figure 1A). Sudemycin C and D1 induced apoptosis in
CLL cells in a dose-response fashion achieving a mean
response of 45.2 ± 20.1% and 63.4 ± 15.3% at the highest
dose, respectively. At 48 hours, the cytotoxic effect was
enhanced and sudemycin-induced apoptosis reached 57.9
± 24.8% and 73.3 ± 24.3% for C and D1 at 500 nM dose.
As expected, sudemycin D1 demonstrated to be more
effective than C in inducing CLL apoptosis at all the doses
tested and both timepoints (***p < 0.001, Figure 1A).
In parallel, we investigated the selective cytotoxicity
of these compounds for CLL tumor cells. For this purpose
we exposed B and T lymphocytes from healthy donors
as well as T cells from CLL patients to the highest dose
(500 nM) of both drugs. As shown in Figure 1B, sudemycins
were significantly less cytotoxic in normal T and B
counterparts than in CLL cells (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01).
Similar results were obtained with 250 nM dose. Sudemycin
D1 (250 nM) was selected for further experiments because
it was more effective at inducing apoptosis than C and
maintained high selectivity for CLL cells.
Next, we sought to determine whether other
B-lymphoid malignancies were also responsive to
sudemycin D1. Tumor cells from mantle cell lymphoma
(MCL; n = 8), follicular lymphoma (FL; n = 4) and
multiple myeloma (MM; n = 4) were exposed to
sudemycin D1 for 24 hours (Supplementary Table S1)
and cytotoxicity was compared to that of CLL cells.
Apoptosis induction resulted to be significantly higher in
CLL cells than in tumor cells from the other malignancies
studied, indicating a particular sensitivity of CLL cells to
sudemycin D1 (Figure 1C; *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01).
Finally, we carefully examined CLL samples
according to the presence of SF3B1 mutations. In
addition, we also considered mutations in genes from
other components of the splicing and RNA processing
machinery. Of 38 CLL cases, 14 were SF3B1-mutated,
8 harbored mutations in other genes of the splicing and
RNA processing machinery and 16 were unmutated for
both conditions (Table 1). Interestingly, although all cases
were particularly sensitive to sudemycin D1, the mutated
SF3B1 CLL cells were more sensitive to the drug than
the unmutated ones. Intriguingly, those cases with other
mutations in splicing and RNA processing machinery
genes were as sensitive as SF3B1-mutated cases to the
spliceosome modulator (Figure 1D, *p < 0.05).

RESULTS

The number of CLL cells in the peripheral blood
and spleen decreases in sudemycin D6-treated mice

Sudemycins induce selective cytotoxicity in
CLL cells with enhanced response in cases with
mutations in the splicing and RNA processing
machinery

In view of the significant in vitro antitumor activity
of sudemycin, the drug was accessed for efficacy in NOD/
SCID/IL2Rγ-/- (NSG) mice engrafted with primary cells
from CLL patients. For these studies sudemycin D6 was
used, which exhibited exactly the same cytotoxicity as D1
(data not shown) and had been optimized for in vivo activity

To evaluate sensitivity to sudemycins, tumor
cells from 41 CLL patients (Table 1) were tested with
sudemycin C and the new improved version sudemycin

cells in the peripheral blood (PB) and spleen of the mice.
Tumor cells reduction in the spleen was near 25 and 40%

for SF3B1-unmutated and -mutated cases, correspondingly.
Altogether these results confirmed that sudemycin D6 was
effective in this NSG/CLL xenograft model.

sudemycin D1 induced a marked downregulation of the
antiapoptotic protein Mcl-1, which was not reverted by
caspase-inhibitor treatment and thus not degraded by caspases
(Figure 3C). Since MCL1 gene encodes the antiapoptotic
Mcl-1-LONG and the proapoptotic Mcl-1-SHORT proteins, and
the Mcl-1-LONG/Mcl-1-SHORT balance is regulated by alternative
splicing [23], we hypothesized that sudemycin D1-induced
apoptosis might be related to the switch of the alternative
splicing of MCL1 toward its proapoptotic short isoform.
Using RT-PCR with specific primers for exon 1 and exon 3
of MCL1, we showed that sudemycin D1 upregulated MCL1splice variant, which lacks exon 2, while decreasing
SHORT
MCL1-LONG, already at 30 minutes of treatment, both in
SF3B1-unmutated and -mutated CLL cases (Figure 3D).

The apoptotic effect of sudemycin D1 is related
to MCL1 alternative splicing
To assess the ability of sudemycin D1 to modulate
spliceosome activity in CLL cells, we analyzed DNAJB1
expression as a surrogate marker for RNA splicing
modulation [16]. A 6-hour treatment was chosen to avoid
unspecific events related to cell death induction. As shown
in Figure 3A, we confirmed that a 6-hour sudemycin D1
incubation increased the unspliced form of DNAJB1 that
retained intron 2, both in SF3B1-unmutated and -mutated
CLL samples.
Next, in order to characterize the cell death
mechanisms of sudemycin D1-induced cytotoxicity,
primary cells from SF3B1-unmutated and -mutated CLL
cases were preincubated with the pan-caspase inhibitor
Q-VD-OPh before drug treatment and apoptotic markers
were analyzed by flow cytometry. As shown in Figure 3B,
Q-VD-OPh efficiently blocked both caspase-3 activation
and phosphatidylserine (PS) exposure, indicating that the
apoptotic process was caspase-dependent. Interestingly,

Sudemycin D1 induces RELA alternative
splicing together with the inhibition of the

Among the prosurvival pathways in CLL, we were
particularly interested in investigating whether sudemycins
were able to modulate NF-κB signaling due to its critical
role in CLL pathogenesis [24, 25].
First, gene expression of well-known protumor NFκB target genes (IL8, MMP9 and CCL4) was determined

by quantitative RT-PCR. After a 6-hour exposure to
sudemycin D1, a significant decrease in all NF-κB
target genes was observed in both SF3B1-mutated and
-unmutated CLL cases (*p < 0.05). SF3B1-mutated cases,
showed a higher reduction of these targets than unmutated
ones, suggesting that NF-κB modulation by sudemycin
could, at least partially, explain the slight differences in
sensitivity to sudemycin (Figure 4A).
To further explore the role of NF-κB on sudemycin
activity, we stimulated the NF-κB pathway in CLL cells
with CD40 ligand (CD40L) and interleukin 4 (IL4)
soluble factors. Consistently, an about a 2-fold increase
in phospho-p65 (p-p65) levels was detected after this
stimulation. Sudemycin D1 demonstrated to overcome
the prosurvival effects induced by CD40L and IL4 since
it was as effective at inducing apoptosis as in control cells
(Figure 4B).
Next, we focused on RELA (p65) because the
functional effect of its alternative splice variants had
been characterized. RELA exon 8 encodes for the Rel
homology domain, which is required for dimerization and
DNA binding [26]. In order to find whether this exon was
lost by alternative splicing after sudemycin treatment,
we analyzed by RT-PCR exons 7 to 10 from RELA.
Indeed, an isoform lacking exon 8 and partially exon 7 (as
confirmed by sequencing) was detected when CLL cells
were exposed to a short incubation with sudemycin D1 in
both SF3B1-mutated and unmutated cases (Figure 4C and
Supplementary Information).
Finally, NF-κB activity was assessed in nuclear
extracts from sudemycin-treated CLL cells both in SF3B1mutated and unmutated cases by means of the p65 DNA
binding capacity. As shown in Figure 4D, 6-hour exposure
to sudemycin D1 reduced NF-κB p65 activity by 20–30%,
showing a moderate bias for the SF3B1-mutated when
compared to the -unmutated CLL cases.

sudemycin D1 induced a moderate increase of pBtk
levels both in SF3B1-mutated and unmutated CLL cases
(p = 0.06, marginally significant). As expected, the Btk
inhibitor ibrutinib downregulated pBtk (*p < 0.05) while
the levels of pBtk in the combination remained as low
as ibrutinib alone (Figure 5B), indicating that ibrutinib
blocked this undesired effect of sudemycin.
Ibtk is a physiological inhibitor of Btk and
particularly its exon 25 encodes the region of the protein
required for Btk binding [28, 29]. For this reason, we
analyzed whether this exon could be lost by alternative
splicing after sudemycin D1 exposure. Consistently, using
an RT-PCR strategy to detect IBTK transcripts spanning
exons 24 to 26, a band of lower molecular weight than
the full isoform was amplified after incubation of CLL
cells with sudemycin D1 for 6 hours. This shorter
band corresponded to the isoform lacking exon 25 as
confirmed by sequencing (Figure 5C and Supplementary
Information). In contrast, ibrutinib alone did not induce
this isoform, which was nevertheless generated with the
drug combination (Figure 5D).
Altogether these results demonstrated that the
combination of sudemycin D1 with ibrutinib resulted in
an enhanced cytototoxic effect involving IBTK splicing
modulation.

DISCUSSION
Mutations or misregulated expression of the
components of the spliceosome can influence the splicing
pattern of several genes and play a crucial role in the
development of tumors. In this line, genes encoding the
spliceosome have been reported to be frequently mutated
or overexpressed in cancer [15, 30, 31]. In CLL, SF3B1
mutations have emerged as one of the most frequent driver
aberrations [6, 8, 32]. Although the functional impact
of this alteration in CLL pathogenesis remains still illdefined, its relevance is highlighted by the evidence that
SF3B1-mutated patients show more aggressive disease and
shorter survival than unmutated ones. In fact, the presence
of SF3B1 mutations is associated with disease subtype
[6, 8], progression [6, 9, 33], chemotherapy resistance
[9, 14] and overall patient survival [34]. Accordingly, the
frequency of SF3B1 mutations at diagnosis is around
5%–7%, and raises up at progression (17%) or after
treatment (12%–24%) [35]. Recently, gene targeting
and knockdown experiments collectively have revealed
that SF3B1 is a proto-oncogene [36, 37], and others have
proposed that SF3B1 mutations in CLL lead to a defective
DNA-damage response [38]. It is plausible that SF3B1
mutations alter features of branch point recognition by the
SF3B complex. In fact, increased intron retention, alternative
splicing and activation of cryptic 3′ splice sites were reported
in CLL samples harboring SF3B1 mutations [6, 8, 39].
Additionally, recurrent mutations in other genes of the
mRNA splicing, processing and transport machinery are also

The combination of sudemycin D1 with ibrutinib
results in an enhanced cytototoxic effect in
parallel with IBTK splicing modulation
In CLL, the promising results at clinical level of
the Btk inhibitor ibrutinib have motivated numerous trials
in combination with chemotherapy or immunotherapy
[27]. In order to find out a potential clinically
relevant combination for sudemycin, we explored the
combination with ibrutinib. For this purpose, primary
CLL cells from SF3B1-unmutated and -mutated cases
were simultaneously exposed to sudemycin D1 and the
Btk inhibitor for 48 hours. Interestingly, the combination
induced significantly more apoptosis than each drug
alone both in mutated and unmutated CLL cases (Figure
5A; *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01). Next, we postulated that Btk
activity might be synergistically downmodulated with
the drug combination. To test this, we analyzed activated
phospho-Btk (pBtk) by flow cytometry. Surprisingly,

found in CLL [10]. Therefore, the evident relevance of the
alternative splicing pathway in CLL offers the opportunity
to design new specific therapeutic strategies targeting the
spliceosome.
In this article, we tested the antitumor activity of the
novel splicing modulators sudemycins in CLL primary
samples. Sudemycins effectively disturb alternative
splicing in CLL cells, similar to what has been observed
in other tumor models [20–22]. Our results elucidate for
the first time that low doses of these compounds induce
apoptosis in CLL cells, while affecting cell death and
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

survival pathways. Intriguingly, CLL cells are exceptionally
sensitive to the drug when compared with tumor cells from
other B-lymphoid malignancies, with no alterations in
SF3B1 reported (MCL, FL and MM), suggesting that this
pathway is crucial for CLL pathogenesis. In this line, and
in contrast to normal B cells, CLL cells have increased
SF3B1 expression [9]. Accordingly, we demonstrated that
the cytotoxic effect is selective for B-CLL cells, given that
normal T and B counterparts remain almost unaffected. This
tumor-selective toxicity is consistent with a model where
the tumor cells have a deficient regulation of alternative

splicing, in contrast to normal cells, where this system
is highly regulated and in consequence, less sensitive to
spliceosome modulators [40]. Several natural products, their
derivatives and synthetic analogs that target the spliceosome
have showed antitumor properties. This effect has been
related to the ability of these drugs to alter the alternative
splicing of genes that are relevant for cancer progression
[30]. In this context, we showed that the apoptotic effect of
sudemycin might be related to MCL1 alternative splicing,
similar to what has been described for other spliceosome
modulators [41, 42]. In CLL, Mcl-1 is a key controller
of cell survival and correlates with other poor prognostic
markers [43]. Sudemycin switches the alternative splicing
of MCL1 toward its proapoptotic short isoform, which
presumably leads to the induction of the mitochondrial
apoptotic pathway and the activation of caspase-dependent
factors. Recently, MCL1-LONG down-regulation rather
than MCL1-SHORT up-regulation has been postulated to be
the driver of preferential killing of Mcl-1-dependent cells
[44]. These authors demonstrated that cytotoxicity can be
rescued by overexpression MCL1-LONG, whereas MCL1overexpression had no significant effect on cells. On
SHORT
the other hand, splicing modulators that induced very high
levels of MCL1-SHORT mRNA in the absence potent MCL1down-regulation exhibited minimal cytotoxicity [44].
LONG
Remarkably, we also demonstrated sudemycin
efficacy in the in vivo setting, specifically in a NSG mice
engrafted with peripheral blood cells from CLL patients that
recapitulates the role of the human lymph node for CLL
cells [45]. Sudemycin reduces the presence of tumor CLL
cells in the peripheral blood and spleen of mice both in
SF3B1-unmutated and -mutated cases though using a very
low dose, suggesting that sudemycin might target CLL
cells in their protective niches, where several prosurvival
pathways are more activated [24]. Among them, NF-κB
signaling plays a critical role in CLL pathogenesis and
has become a potential therapeutic target [25]. In this
context, sudemycin also functionally disturbs NF-κB
pathway together with the induction of a spliced RELA
variant that has a diminished DNA-binding ability [26].
As a consequence, sudemycin treatment inhibits RELA
activity, both basal and induced by CD40L-IL4 stimulus,
and decreases the expression of several target genes related
to inflammation and tumor invasion, such as IL8, MMP9
and CCL4. All these results suggest that sudemycin could
disrupt tumor microenvironment interactions that are often
related to chemoresistance and disease relapses [46].
Importantly, we also showed for the first time that
the presence of mutations in SF3B1 or other spliceosome/
RNA processing-related genes confers further sensitivity
to sudemycin. According to our results, NF-κB pathway
inhibition might at least partially contribute to these
differences in sensitivity. While all CLL samples are
particularly sensitive to the compound, very low doses
would be enough in mutated cases, probably reflecting an
accentuated deregulation of the splicing/RNA-processing
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

mechanisms in the mutated cells. In this sense, RNA
sequencing analysis of SF3B1-mutated CLL cases has
revealed a major disturbance in the splicing fidelity of a large
number of genes in comparison to -unmutated cases [39, 47].
In CLL, activity and tolerability at clinical level
of the Btk inhibitor ibrutinib has led to its approval
and has motivated numerous trials in combination with
chemotherapy or immunotherapy [27]. In this line,
spliceosome modulators in combination with this agent
might be an attractive therapeutic strategy to test in CLL
patients. Our findings demonstrated for the first time a
collaborative antitumor effect of sudemycin with the Btk
inhibitor. Although other splicing events in the components
of the B-cell receptor pathway might also occur, we
have demonstrated that Ibtk might play a crucial role
in the interaction between drugs. Ibtk is an important
negative regulator of Btk, which leads to inefficient
autophosphorylation of Btk on residue Y223 when bound
to the PH domain of Btk, thus inhibiting Btk activity [28].
IBTK alternative splicing modulation by sudemycin triggers
the loss of regulatory function of this protein over Btk,
consequently upregulating pBtk that is easily overcome
by ibrutinib addition. Our results suggest that increased
levels of pBtk after sudemycin exposure could confer
enhanced sensitivity to ibrutinib. This would be consistent
with a report where high pBtk levels correlated with major
sensitivity toward ibrutinib in acute myeloid leukemia [48].
In summary, we show that sudemycin interferes
in the splicing program of several genes critical for CLL
survival and apoptosis. Our results confirm that targeting
the spliceosome in CLL is a promising therapeutic
strategy, not only for those patients harboring mutations
in the splicing machinery. Collectively, our study
provides solid rationale for future clinical development
of splicesome inhibitors alone or in combination with
ibrutinib in CLL patients.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Isolation and culture of primary cells
Primary cells from 41 CLL patients, who were either
untreated or had not received treatment for the at least
previous 12 months, were studied (Table 1). Mutations
in SF3B1 and/or other genes involved in mRNA splicing,
processing and transport (U2AF2, SFRS2, SRSF7, XPO1,
NXF1, DDX3X, CPEB3, SMG7, CDCL, HELZ) were
known from sequencing studies previously reported [6].
The IGVH gene mutational status was determined according
to European Research Initiative on CLL (ERIC) guidelines
[49]. Percentage of tumor cells (CD19+, CD5+) together
with cytogenetic alterations were obtained from the clinical
healthcare activity and assessed by flow cytometry and
(FISH) respectively, when sampling. Samples from 8 MCL,
4 FL and 4 MM patients (Supplementary Table S1) and
5 healthy donors were also studied.

Primary cells were isolated from PB (for CLL, MCL
and healthy donors) or bone marrow (BM; for MM) by
Ficoll-Paque sedimentation (GE Healthcare). Primary FL
cells were obtained from lymph nodes (LN) after squirting
with RPMI 1640 (Life Technologies) culture medium
using a fine needle. Samples were stored within the

temperature cycling conditions of 94ºC for 5 minutes,
35 cycles of 94ºC for 30 seconds, 60ºC for 30 seconds
and 68ºC for 2 minutes, and finally 72ºC for 5 minutes.
PCR were performed with the following primer pairs:
5′-GAACCAAAATCACTTTCCCCAAGGAAGG-3′ and
5′- AATGAGGTCCCCACGTTTCTCGGGTGT-3′ for
DNAJB1 [16], 5′- GAGGAGGAGGAGGACGAGTT-3′

5′-TGTGGATCTCAGAACTATCATGGAA-3′ and 5′GCCTGAACTATGGCTAGTAACAGACTT-3′ for IBTK.
PCR products were separated in a QIAxcel capillary
electrophoresis device (QIAgen). For sequencing,
splicing PCR was performed with the above primers
harboring an M13 5′-tail and the following conditions:
95ºC for 10 minutes, 10 cycles of 95ºC for 30 seconds,
65ºC (decreasing 1ºC each cycle) for 30 seconds and 72ºC
for 1 minute, 25 cycles of 95ºC for 30 seconds, 55ºC for
30 seconds and 72ºC for 1 minute, and finally 72ºC for
7 minutes. PCR products were separated in an agarose gel
and the candidate product was purified with NucleoSpin
Gel and PCR Clean-up (Macherey-Nagel). Sequencing
PCR was performed with the M13 universal primers and
the BigDye Terminator v1.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Life
Technologies). The experiment was repeated 3 times and
representative cases are shown.

Drug incubation and analysis of apoptosis
Cells were incubated with 100 to 500 nM of
sudemycin C, D1 or D6 (synthesized and formulated in
the laboratory of Thomas R. Webb) [22] and/or 1 μM of
Ibrutinib (Selleck Chemicals) for 30 minutes to 48 hours.
When specified, cells were preincubated for 1 hour with 10
μM of the pan-caspase inhibitor Q-VD-OPh (Calbiochem),
or CD40L (1 μg/mL) and IL4 (20 ng/mL; Sigma-Aldrich).
Apoptosis was quantified by labeling PS residues exposure
with annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) and
nuclei with propidium iodide (PI; eBioscience). For the
analysis of apoptosis in CD3+ (T lymphocytes) and CD19+
(B lymphocytes) populations, cells were simultaneously
labeled with anti-CD3-FITC, anti-CD19-Phycoerythrin (PE;
Becton Dickinson) and annexin V-Pacific Blue (PB; Life
Technologies). All samples contained > 80% of tumor cells
except for MM, where tumor cells were co-labeled with
anti-CD38-PE (Becton Dickinson) and annexin V-FITC, in
order to gate the population of interest. Caspase-3 activation
was quantified with CellEvent caspase 3/7 green detection
reagent (Life Technologies). Ten thousand single cell events
per sample were acquired in an Attune acoustic cytometer
(Life Technologies). Cytotoxicity values were obtained after
relative quantification with each respective control sample
(without treatment). Untreated control sample represented
0% of cytotoxicity for each patient’s sample.

Protein analysis
Protein extracts were obtained and processed as
previously described [50]. Membranes were blocked with
2.5% phosphoBlocker (Cell Biolabs) in Tris-Buffered
Saline (TBS)-Tween 20. For protein immunodetection,
the specific primary antibodies were used: Mcl-1,
phospho(Ser536)-p65 (p-p65; Cell Signaling Technology)
and β-actin (Sigma-Aldrich). Anti-rabbit and anti-mouse
horseradish peroxidase-labeled IgG (Sigma-Aldrich) were
used as secondary antibodies. Chemiluminescence was
detected with ECL substrate (Pierce Biotechnology) on a
mini-LAS4000 Fujifilm device (GE Healthcare). Signal
was quantified with Image Gauge densitometric software
(Fujifilm) and referred to the respective untreated control.
