Abstract
Overexpression of MUC1 oncoprotein is frequently observed in
cancer and contributes to confer resistance to genotoxic
agents. Papillary, follicular, and anaplastic thyroid carcinomas are the three forms of thyroid epithelial cancer.
Anaplastic tumors are less differentiated and extremely
aggressive, characterized by a poor prognosis. Little is known
about the role of MUC1 in thyroid cancer. We recently showed
that autocrine production of interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-10
controls thyroid cancer cell survival, growth, and resistance to
chemotherapy through activation of Janus-activated kinase/
signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAK/STAT)
and phosphatidylinositide 3¶-OH kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathways.
In the present study, we showed that MUC1 COOH-terminal
subunit (MUC1-C) is overexpressed in all the histologic
variants of thyroid cancer cells and localizes to mitochondria
where it interferes with the release of mitochondrial proapoptotic proteins. Moreover, IL-4 and IL-10 promote the
increase of MUC1-C expression levels in normal thyroid cells,
whereas blockage of both cytokines or neutralization of JAK/
STAT and PI3K/Akt pathways through the exogenous expression of SOCS-1 and AktK179M leads to a significant decrease of
MUC1-C in primary thyroid cancer cells. Interestingly, downregulation of MUC1 expression by direct targeting with RNA
interference sensitizes anaplastic thyroid cancer cells to
chemotherapy-induced apoptosis in vitro. Thus, MUC1 is a
main component of the survival network acting in thyroid
cancer and could be considered a key molecular target for
sensitizing cancer cells to conventional or novel treatments.

Introduction
Three main types of malignant tumors originate from thyroid
epithelium: the more differentiated papillary and follicular thyroid
carcinomas (PTC and FTC) and undifferentiated/anaplastic thyroid
carcinomas (UTC; ref. 1). Total thyroidectomy is accepted as
elective treatment for most patients with differentiated thyroid
carcinomas, whereas UTC is associated with an extremely high
disease-specific mortality and the treatment is generally palliative
for a disease that is rarely cured and almost always fatal (2, 3).

Clinical trials with chemotherapeutic drugs have produced only
rare positive responses in thyroid cancers as a result of activation of
effective antiapoptotic pathways (4, 5). Antineoplastic drugs are a
class of cytotoxic compounds that activate the intrinsic apoptotic
pathway involving the release from mitochondria of death factors,
such as cytochrome c, Apaf-1, apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF), and
second mitochondria-derived activator of caspases/direct inhibitor
of apoptosis–binding protein with low isoelectric point (Smac/
DIABLO; ref. 6). In the cytosol, cytochrome c forms a complex with
Apaf-1 and activates caspase-9, which can directly activate caspase-3
and the subsequent execution pathway (7). The relative levels and
competing dimerization between Bcl-2 family members regulate
cytochrome c release from mitochondria, thus determining cell
susceptibility to apoptotic signals (8, 9). In this regard, as we
previously reported, interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-10 act as autocrine
growth factors in thyroid cancer microenvironment, inducing upregulation of antiapoptotic proteins, such as Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, FLIP, and
PED, which protect thyroid cancer cells from death induced by CD95
and chemotherapeutic drugs (10, 11). Moreover, treatment of thyroid
cancer cells with neutralizing antibodies against IL-4 and IL-10
results in down-regulation of antiapoptotic proteins and sensitization to CD95-induced and cytotoxic drug–induced apoptosis (10, 11).
IL-4 binding to its receptor results in activation of Janusactivated kinase (JAK) 1/signal transducers and activators of
transcription (STAT) 6 transduction pathway, inducing the
expression of several genes, including antiapoptotic ped and flip
genes, in FTC cells (10). IL-4 induces phosphorylation of insulinlike receptor substrate (IRS) molecules, which are essential for
IL-4–stimulated mitogenesis (12). IRS molecule activation allows
the recruitment of phosphatidylinositide 3¶-OH kinase (PI3K) to the
inner surface of plasma membrane, resulting in PI3K-generated
phospholipids, which act as docking sites for Akt/protein kinase B
serine/threonine protein kinase, leading to Akt cascade activation
(13). Increasing evidences have shown that PI3K/Akt signaling is
deregulated in several human malignant diseases (14, 15). In
thyroid cancer cells, PI3K/Akt signaling pathway is aberrantly
activated (16, 17).
In normal secretory epithelial cells, MUC1 is expressed as a
transmembrane glycoprotein that provides protection against
pathogens and shows cell signaling ability (18). Following synthesis
as a single polypeptide and cleavage in the endoplasmic reticulum,
MUC1 is expressed on cell membrane as a heterodimer (19). The
MUC1 NH2-terminal subunit (MUC1-N) consists of variable
numbers of 20–amino acid tandem repeats that are modified by
O-glycans (20, 21). MUC1-N is tethered to the cell membrane
through dimerization with the approximately 20- to 25-kDxa
COOH-terminal subunit (MUC1-C), which consists of a 58–amino
acid extracellular domain, a 28–amino acid transmembrane, and a

MUC1 in Thyroid Cancer

72–amino acid cytoplasmic domain (MUC1-CD; ref. 22). With
transformation and loss of polarity, MUC1 is found at high levels in
the cytosol and throughout the cell membrane of carcinoma cells
(23). MUC1 oncoprotein overexpression is sufficient to attenuate
oxidative-induced and genotoxic stress–induced apoptosis in most
cancers (24, 25). In addition, recent findings have revealed that
diverse carcinoma cells express the MUC1-C in mitochondria or in
the nucleus in association with the Wnt effector h-catenin (25–29).
MUC1 interacts with members of the ErbB family of receptor
tyrosine kinases and with the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3
(26, 30, 31). Stimulation of such receptors induces c-Src–dependent
tyrosine phosphorylation of the MUC1-CD on a YEKV motif and
thereby results in nuclear localization of MUC1 and h-catenin or
heat shock protein (Hsp) 90–mediated targeting of MUC1 to
mitochondria (25, 31, 32).
Recently, it has been reported that MUC1-induced transformation of fibroblasts is due to activation of the antiapoptotic PI3K/
Akt and Bcl-xL pathways (33). By contrast, in colon and breast
carcinoma cells, MUC1 cytoplasmic domain activates the FOXO3a
transcription factor that induces oxidant scavenging and DNA
repair in a survival response to oxidative stress; this observation is
due to the reduced activation of PI3K/Akt pathway and thereby to
the decreased FOXO3a phosphorylation (34). These findings
collectively suggest that the close cross-talk occurring between
MUC1 and Akt signal transduction pathway depends on the cell
context.
MUC1 oncoprotein overexpression has been proposed as a key
molecular event in the pathogenesis of aggressive PTC, thus
designating it as a prognostic marker and potential therapeutic
target for this disease (35–37).
In the present study, we examined MUC1-C expression and
intracellular targeting in tumor cells of all the histologic variants of
thyroid carcinoma. We speculated that both IL-4 and IL-10
cytokines may contribute to the regulation of muc1 transcription
and/or MUC1-C protein expression by activating both JAK/STAT
and PI3K/Akt signal transduction pathways, eventually controlling
the sensitivity of thyroid cancer cells to conventional chemotherapeutic agents.

Materials and Methods
Human tissues. Thyroid cancer specimens were obtained at the time of
surgical treatment. Thyroid normal tissues were obtained from the
uninvolved, contralateral lobes of tumor glands or from nontoxic goiter
glands in accordance with the ethical standards of the institutional
committee responsible for human experimentation. Histologic diagnosis
was based on the behavioral microscopic features of carcinoma cells
determining the histologic type and grade.
Human primary cell purification. Normal and cancer thyroid tissues
were digested for 2 h with collagenase (1.5 mg/mL; Life Technologies) and
hyaluronidase (20 Ag/mL; Sigma Chemical Co.) in DMEM as described
previously (11). Once digested, cells were maintained on plastic in DMEM
containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS), antibiotics, and
L-glutamine at 37jC in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 for 12 h, which
allowed the removal of other cells. Fibroblasts were depleted, exposing cell
cultures to trypsin/EDTA for 1 min.
Cell culture. Human NPA and BC-PAP PTC cells were cultured in
DMEM and RPMI 1640, respectively. Human WRO and FTC 133 FTC cells
were grown in DMEM and DMEM/F12, respectively, whereas human ARO
UTC cells were grown in RPMI 1640. MCF-7 breast carcinoma cells were
cultured in DMEM/F12. Ten percent of heat-inactivated FBS, antibiotics,
and L-glutamine were added to each culture medium. Cells were detached
with trypsin/EDTA for gene transcript and protein expression analyses.

Freshly purified normal thyroid cells and UTC cells were cultured,
respectively, in the presence or absence of human recombinant IL-4
(20 ng/mL) or IL-10 (40 ng/mL; Euroclone) for 24 h and neutralizing
antibodies against human IL-4 (15 Ag/mL) or IL-10 (15 Ag/mL; R&D
Systems) for 72 h; after exposures, cells were detached with trypsin/EDTA
for mRNA and protein expression analyses. Untransfected UTC cells
(control), UTC cells transfected with a nonspecific small interfering
RNA (siRNA; scrambled), or MUC1siRNA was treated with Cisplatin
(300 ng/mL), Doxorubicin (5 Amol/L), or Taxol (5 Amol/L) for 24 h and
assessed for apoptotic events.
Immunoblot analysis. Cell pellets were resuspended in ice-cold NP40
lysis buffer [50 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mmol/L NaCl, 1 mmol/L
EGTA, 1% NP40] containing proteases and phosphatase inhibitors as
described previously (38). Equal amounts of proteins (30 Ag) were
separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to Hybond-C nitrocellulose
membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Membranes were blocked
for 1 h with 5% nonfat dry milk in TBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 and
successively incubated overnight with antibodies specific to MUC1-C (clone
Ab5, hamster monoclonal IgG; NeoMarkers), Hsp60 (clone LK2, mouse
IgG1; Sigma-Aldrich), SOCS-1 (clone N-18, goat polyclonal IgG; Santa Cruz
Biotechnology), HA (clone 16B12, mouse IgG1; Babco), phosphorylated
Akt (Ser473, rabbit polyclonal; Cell Signaling Technology), Akt (rabbit
polyclonal; Cell Signaling Technology), phosphorylated JAK1 (Tyr1022/1023,
rabbit polyclonal; Cell Signaling Technology), JAK1 (rabbit polyclonal; Cell
Signaling Technology), phosphorylated STAT6 (Tyr641, rabbit polyclonal;
Cell Signaling Technology), STAT6 (rabbit polyclonal; Cell Signaling
Technology), cleaved caspase-3 (Asp175, rabbit polyclonal; Cell Signaling
Technology), and h-actin (clone Ab-1, mouse IgM; Calbiochem). After
washing, blots were incubated for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase–
conjugated anti-mouse, anti-rabbit (Amersham Biosciences UK Ltd.), antigoat (Chemicon International), or anti-Armenian hamster antibodies
(Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) and visualized with enhanced
chemiluminescence detection systems (SuperSignal West Pico/Dura
Extended Duration Substrate, Pierce Biotechnology).
Reverse-transcription and real-time PCR analysis. Total RNA from
cell pellets was obtained using the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen GmbH)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Reverse transcription and
PCR amplification of 250 ng of total RNA were done using One-Step Reverse
Transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Oligonucleotide primers for RT-PCR were designed according
to the published sequences [MUC1, Genbank accession no. NM_002456.4;
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), Genbank accession
no. NM_002046]. The primers used for reverse transcription and
amplification were the following: MUC1, 5¶-CGACGTGGAGACACAGTTCAATCA-3¶ ( forward; 465–488) and 5¶-TAGGTGGGGTACTCGCTCATAGGA3¶ (reverse; 732–755); GAPDH, 5¶-TGACATCAAGAAGGTGGTGA-3¶ ( forward;
870–889) and 5¶-TCCACCACCCTGTTGCTGTA-3¶ (reverse; 1060–1079).
RT-PCR was done using the following conditions: 50jC for 30 min, 95j
for 15 min, 1 cycle; 94jC for 1 min, 56jC for 45 s, 72jC for 45 s, 35 cycles.
PCR products were analyzed by electrophoresis on 4% agarose gels.
For real-time PCR analysis, RNA was reverse transcribed using the HighCapacity cDNA Archive kit (Applied Biosystems). Quantitative Taqman PCR
analysis was done with the ABI PRISM 7900HT Sequence Detection System
(Applied Biosystem) in a reaction volume of 25 AL containing 1 Taqman
Universal Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) and 1 probes and primer sets
Hs00159357_m1 (MUC1; Taqman Gene Expression Assays, Applied
Biosystems) or 1 Hu GAPDH (Pre-Developed Taqman Assay Reagents,
Applied Biosystems). Reactions were done using the following thermal
cycler variables: incubation at 50jC for 2 min and denaturation at 95jC for
10 min and then 40 cycles of the amplification step (denaturation at
95jC for 15 s and annealing/extension at 60jC for 1 min).
All amplification reactions were done in triplicate, and the relative
quantitation of MUC1 gene expression was calculated using the comparative C t method (DDC t). Levels of mRNA expression were expressed after
normalization with endogenous control, GAPDH. Data processing and
statistical analysis were done using the ABI PRISM SDS, software version 2.1
(Applied Biosystems).

Immunofluorescence. Cells were cultured on coverslips and incubated
in DMEM containing 100 nmol/L MitoTracker Red Mitochondrion-Selective
Probe CMXRos for 30 min at 37jC in the dark. After staining, cells were
washed with fresh growth medium, fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde/PBS,
permeabilized in PBS containing Triton X-100 for 3 min at room
temperature, and stained with anti-MUC1-C (clone Ab5, hamster monoclonal IgG) or anti-cytochrome c (clone 6H2.B4, mouse IgG1; BD PharMingen)
antibodies for 1 h at 37jC in the dark. Cells were then incubated with FITCconjugated anti-Armenian hamster or anti-mouse (Molecular Probes)
antibodies for 1 h at 37jC in the dark and finally incubated with Hoechst
(Molecular Probes) for 2 min at room temperature. After mounting the
coverslips, images were captured with a fluorescence microscope.
Mitochondria isolation. Cells were homogenized with a glass-Teflon
directly into an ice-cold isolation buffer, TKV, containing 0.1 mol/L TrisHCl (pH 7.4), 0.423 mol/L KCl, 0.001 mol/L EDTA, 1 Ag/mL aprotinin,
1 Ag/mL leupeptin, 1 Ag/mL pepstatin, and 1 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl
fluoride. The homogenates were collected and centrifuged at 3,200  g for
10 min at 4jC. Supernatants were transferred to clean tubes and
centrifuged at 14,000  g for 10 min at 4jC. Following centrifugation,
mitochondrial pellets were washed twice with PBS and resuspended, on
ice, in the same lysis buffer used for protein extraction for 30 min. The
samples were then subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis.
Production of lentiviral particles and infection of thyrocytes. SOCS1 (kindly provided by Dr. A. Yoshimura, Department of Infectious Diseases,
University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki, Japan; ref. 39) and AktK179M (HA-tagged
AktK179M, kindly provided by Prof. G.L. Condorelli, University of Rome ‘‘La
Sapienza,’’ Rome, Italy) were subcloned in the Tween vector, generated by
engineering pRRLsin.cPPT.hCMV.GFP.Wpre. In this vector, the hCMV.GFP
cassette was substituted with the hCMV.hPGK.GFP. Lentiviral supernatants
were produced by calcium phosphate transient transfection in the
packaging human embryonic kidney cell line 293T (40). UTC cells
(5 105) were plated in 25-cm2 flask in the presence of viral supernatants
of Tween empty vector or SOCS-1 or AktK179M and 4 Ag/mL of polybrene to
improve infection efficiency. Cells were allowed to grow for 2 h at 37jC in
humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. After two cycles of infection, cells were
washed twice and fresh medium was added. Infection efficiency was
evaluated after 48 h by monitoring green fluorescent protein expression and
detecting SOCS-1 or HA expression levels.
Generation of siRNA for transfection. siRNAs were synthesized to
target the MUC1 sequence (Genbank accession no. NM_002456.4; 192–212;
exon 2) 5¶-AAGTTCAGTGCCCAGCTCTAC-3¶. MUC1siRNAs (194–212), 5¶GUUCAGUGCCCAGCUCUACdTdT-3¶ (sense) and 5¶-GUAGAGCUGGGCA-

CUGAACdTdT (antisense; MWG-Biotech AG). A nonspecific siRNA
(scrambled) was also synthesized (5¶-GCGCGCUUUGUAGGAUUCGdTdT-3¶
and 5¶-CGAAUCCUACAAAGCGCGCdTdT-3¶). Purified UTC cells plated in
six-well plates at 3  105 per well were grown in antibiotic-free medium
overnight and then transfected with scrambled or MUC1siRNA using
Oligofectamine reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. At 72 h after transfection, cells were detached with trypsin/
EDTA, replated, and allowed to grow overnight before treatment.
Knockdown efficiency was evaluated by RT-PCR and Western blot.
Cell death quantitation. Cells were plated in 96-well plates in triplicate
at 15,000 per well. The percentage of viable cells was determined by 3-(4,5dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium (MTS) assay using CellTiter 96 Aqueous One Solution Cell
Proliferation Assay (Promega Corp.) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Death of control, scrambled, and MUC1siRNA-transfected UTC cells
exposed to chemotherapeutic agents was also analyzed by orange acridine/
ethidium bromide staining.
Caspase-3 activity detection. Caspase-3 activity was detected by
ApoAlert Caspase-3 Colorimetric Assay kit (Clontech) according to the
instruction manual. Briefly, lysates of 2  105 cells per well were transferred
into each well of a Caspase Profiling Assay Plate containing a specific
caspase-3 substrate (Asp-Glu-Val-Asp or DEVD) linked to chromophore
p-nitroanilide (pNA) and then incubated at 37jC for 2 h. On cleavage of
DEVD-pNA by caspase- 3, released pNA was monitored colorimetrically by
absorbance at 405 nm.
Statistical analysis. Data were expressed as mean F SD. ANOVA (one
way) with Bonferroni adjustment was used to analyze the statistical
significance of the results, and the analysis was done using GraphPad Prism
version 4.00 for Windows (GraphPad Software). P values of <0.05 were
considered significant.

Results
Thyroid cancer cells express high levels of MUC1-C. To
evaluate MUC1-C expression levels in thyroid carcinoma cells,
immunoblot analyses on cell lysates obtained from freshly purified
normal, goiter, PTC, FTC, and UTC cells and from five thyroid
cancer cell lines were done. Interestingly, MUC1-C was found
overexpressed in primary cancer cells derived from all the
histologic variants of thyroid carcinoma and basically not
detectable in primary thyroid normal cells, whereas freshly purified

and UTC cells were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis for
MUC1-C. Hsp60 detection in the same membrane was used as loading control.
One representative of three independent experiments.

goiter cells resulted strongly positive (Fig. 1A). MUC1-C overexpression in goiter cells was probably due to the high proliferative
rate of these cells, resulting from activation of mitogenic pathways,
in which MUC1-C could be strictly involved. MUC1-C expression
pattern in thyroid cancer cell lines showed that MUC1-C levels
increased in the histologic variants with low grade of differentiation and high malignancy extent (Fig. 1B). The observation that
mRNAs for MUC1 were homogeneously expressed in all thyroid
cells analyzed suggests that the considerable MUC1-C formation in
thyroid tumor cells could be considered a post-translational event
mainly active in highly aggressive tumor cells (Fig. 1C and D).
MUC1-C localizes to mitochondria of thyroid cancer cells.
An aberrant intracellular targeting of the COOH-terminal subunit
of MUC1 oncoprotein has been reported in several epithelial
tumors, such as colon, breast, and lung cancers (25). This event
seems to play a key role in modulating mitochondrial release of
proapoptotic molecules (25).
To analyze the expression pattern and the intracellular
localization of MUC1-C in goiter and thyroid cancer cells, an
immunofluorescence staining was done with an antibody specific
to MUC1-C (Fig. 2A, green). Mitochondria were stained using

www.aacrjournals.org

MitoTracker Red probe (Fig. 2A, red), whereas nuclei were
counterstained with Hoechst (Fig. 2A, blue).
The results showed that MUC1-C was expressed on the cell
membrane of both goiter and tumor cells, whereas mitochondrial
localization was revealed only in cancer cells (Fig. 2A).
To confirm these findings, mitochondrial lysates from freshly
purified goiter and thyroid cancer cells were subjected to
immunoblot analysis for MUC1-C detection. As expected, MUC1C was detectable in the mitochondrial fractions from cancer but
not from goiter cells (Fig. 2B). Of note, mitochondrial localization
of MUC1-C increased in FTC and UTC cells, suggesting a potential
correlation between MUC1-C peculiar intracellular localization and
aggressiveness of thyroid tumor cells (Fig. 2B). Equal loading of
mitochondrial lysates was proved by detecting Hsp60 protein.
IL-4 and IL-10 modulate MUC1-C expression. Thyroid cancer
cell refractoriness to death ligand– and chemotherapeutic drug–
induced apoptosis is due to the autocrine production of IL-4 and
IL-10, resulting in the overexpression of several antiapoptotic
factors (10, 11). To investigate the possible involvement of these
cytokines in the regulation of MUC1-C overexpression, freshly
purified normal thyrocytes were exposed to human recombinant
IL-4, IL-10, or both cytokines for 24 h. Immunoblot analysis of
MUC1-C expression showed that exposure to both cytokines
resulted in a prominent increase of MUC1-C levels, whereas
exposure to a single cytokine exerted a lower effect (Fig. 3A). To
confirm that IL-4 and IL-10 presence in thyroid cancer microenvironment is responsible for increased MUC1-C levels, purified
UTC cells were treated with neutralizing antibodies against both
cytokines for 72 h. Single blockage of IL-4 or IL-10 induced a partial
reduction of MUC1-C expression, which was considerably
enhanced following the combined treatment with both antagonist
antibodies (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, real-time PCR analysis of MUC1
mRNA levels in the same samples revealed that muc1 gene
transcription was significantly influenced by the presence of IL-4 or
IL-10, whose neutralization dramatically reduced the levels of
MUC1 mRNA (Fig. 3C and D). These results show that IL-4 and IL10 affect MUC1 transcription and MUC1-C expression in normal
and tumor thyroid cells.
SOCS-1 and AktK179M exogenous expression decreases
MUC1-C levels. To evaluate the role of the induction of JAK/STAT
and PI3K/Akt pathways in the regulation of muc1 transcription and
MUC1-C expression, we produced lentiviral vectors that allowed
the stable delivery of SOCS-1 and AktK179M in purified UTC cells
(Fig. 4A). SOCS-1 hampers JAK1/STAT6 pathway by direct binding
to JAK1 phosphorylation site, whereas AktK179M is a kinase
defective mutant form of Akt. The effective block of JAK1/STAT6
or PI3K/Akt pathways was verified by evaluating the phosphorylation of JAK1, STAT6, and Akt (Fig. 4B). Western blot analysis
revealed that SOCS-1 or AktK179M exogenous expression yielded a
significant down-regulation of MUC1-C expression levels, which
was even more pronounced when both transduction pathways
were hindered (Fig. 4C). Remarkably, as shown by real-time PCR
analysis, SOCS-1 alone or in combination with AktK179M was
particularly effective in attenuating muc1 transcription, whereas
AktK179M exerted a weaker effect (Fig. 4D). Taken together, these
data show that both JAK1/STAT6 and PI3K/Akt pathways
differentially affect MUC1 expression at mRNA and protein level.
JAK1/STAT6 pathway seems to be mainly involved in the
modulation of muc1 transcription, whereas PI3K/Akt pathway
seems to play a role also in regulating MUC1-C protein stability
within the cell.

Cancer Research

MUC1 down-regulation sensitizes thyroid cancer cells to
chemotherapy-induced apoptosis. Tumor cell resistance to
anticancer agents is often due to activation of antiapoptotic
pathways. To investigate whether MUC1 contributes to the
resistance of thyroid cancer cells to chemotherapeutic drug–
induced apoptosis, we knocked down MUC1 with siRNA duplexes.
Exposure of freshly purified UTC cells to MUC1siRNA was
associated with a marked down-regulation of MUC1 expression
(Fig. 5A and B). In contrast, there was not detectable downregulation of MUC1 in UTC cells exposed to unspecific siRNA
(scrambled; Fig. 5A and B). Control, scrambled, and MUC1siRNAtransfected UTC cells were then treated with Cisplatin, Doxorubicin, or Taxol, conventionally used in thyroid cancer treatment. UTC
cells were resistant to chemotherapeutic drugs even at dosages
higher than those measurable in vivo in the clinical setting
(Fig. 5C). As determined by MTS assay, the rate of death in
scrambled and MUC1siRNA-transfected UTC cells was not
significantly increased compared with untransfected (control)
UTC cells (Fig. 5D). Importantly, MUC1siRNA-transfected UTC
cells exposed to Cisplatin, Doxorubicin, or Taxol showed a 2-fold
increase in the percentage of cell death (Fig. 5D). Similar results
were obtained by orange acridine/ethidium bromide staining and
fluorescence microscopy analysis (Fig. 5D; data not shown). Thus,

MUC1 controls the resistance of thyroid cancer cells exposed to
chemotherapeutic drugs.
MUC1 expression reduces the activation of the intrinsic
apoptotic pathway in thyroid cancer cells treated with
chemotherapeutic drugs. We next investigated whether the
sensitization of thyroid cancer cells to chemotherapeutic drugs
was due to an enhanced activation of the intrinsic apoptotic
pathway following MUC1siRNA transfection. Control, scrambled,
and MUC1siRNA-transfected UTC cells treated with Doxorubicin
were therefore analyzed for cytochrome c release and caspase-3
activation. Immunofluorescence analysis showed increased levels
of cytosolic cytochrome c following Doxorubicin treatment in
MUC1siRNA-transfected UTC cells compared with control cells or
cells treated with a scrambled sequence (Fig. 6A). The increased
release of cytochrome c from mitochondria may promote a more
intense apoptosome formation and activation of executioner
caspases. Accordingly, immunoblot analysis showed that Doxorubicin promoted an increased formation of caspase-3 cleavage

(Fig. 6B). Similarly, MUC1-C down-regulation allowed a significant
increase in DEVDase activity after Doxorubicin exposure (Fig. 6C),
confirming that MUC1 expression prevents the amplification of the
apoptotic cascade activated by mitochondria. Thus, knockdown of

MUC1 expression increases the sensitivity of thyroid cancer cells to
chemotherapeutic drugs through activation of the intrinsic
apoptotic pathway.

Discussion
The ability of tumor cells to escape the cytotoxic activity of
chemotherapeutic drugs may result from several molecular
alterations involving cell cycle and apoptosis (41). In thyroid
cancer, the scarce efficacy of chemotherapy led to the use of
radioiodine therapy, which is capable of eradicating well-differentiated thyroid cancers through the induction of a localized
cytotoxicity. However, such treatment yields very limited response
in patients affected by UTC, for whom life expectancy does not
exceed 6 months (2, 3, 5).
MUC1 oncoprotein has been found overexpressed in most human
carcinomas and has been involved in tumor progression (25).
MUC1-C is indeed able to cross-talk with several signal transduction
pathways involved in tumor transformation (18, 42). Recent findings

www.aacrjournals.org

showed that MUC1 overexpression in human cancers results in the
inhibition of oxidative stress–induced and genotoxic drug–induced
apoptosis. In colon, breast, and lung tumor cells, Hsp70/Hsp90mediated mitochondrial targeting of MUC1-C seemed to occur
and is thought to be responsible for the reduced release from mitochondria of proapoptotic molecules, such as cytochrome c, AIF, and
Smac/DIABLO, contributing to cancer cell refractoriness to
genotoxic agent–induced apoptosis (25, 32, 34).
In this study, we showed that MUC1-C is expressed at high levels
in all the histologic variants of thyroid carcinoma, with a pattern
that suggests an aberrant mitochondrial localization. Although
MUC1-C was undetectable in normal thyroid samples, it is
overexpressed on the cell membrane of goiter cells but did not
show mitochondrial localization, suggesting a possible contribution in cell proliferation but not on the control of cell death. Such
mitochondrial localization of MUC1-C is associated with a
decreased release of cytochrome c with a consequent reduction
of caspase activation and apoptosis in thyroid cancer cells treated
with chemotherapeutic drugs. These data collectively indicate that

MUC1-C overexpression and aberrant intracellular targeting
contribute together with antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family members to
prevent the activation of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway in
response to the exposure to chemotherapeutic drugs.
We have previously shown that the autocrine production of IL-4
and IL-10 by thyroid cancer cells promotes tumor cell growth and
resistance to chemotherapy through the up-regulation of antiapoptotic proteins (10, 11, 43). Accordingly, IL-4 and IL-10
blockage increased the effectiveness of anticancer agents and
proapoptotic stimuli occurring from death receptor activation
(10, 11). Here, we provide evidence that MUC1-C expression is
strictly associated with activation of the IL-4– and IL-10–
dependent signal transduction pathways in thyroid cancer cells.

Indeed, MUC1-C expression and muc1 transcription significantly
increased in normal thyroid cells following the exposure to IL-4
and IL-10, whereas neutralization of both IL-4 and IL-10 in UTC
cells promoted a dramatic decrease of MUC1-C along with MUC1
mRNA levels.
Organization and transcriptional regulation of the MUC1
promoter have been recently investigated (44, 45). The presence
of candidate binding sites for transcription factors of the STAT and
nB families upstream of the transcription start site has been
identified, suggesting the involvement of such transcription factors
in overexpression of MUC1 in tumor cells (44, 45). STATs are
activated by phosphorylation when associated with or recruited to
JAK/receptor complexes at the cell membrane in response to

MUC1 in Thyroid Cancer

activation of a variety of different types of cytokine receptors,
including IL-4 receptor (46, 47). IL-4 receptor stimulation results in
activation of JAK1/STAT6 pathway and in the phosphorylation of
IRS-1, which activates Akt pathway through the recruitment of PI3K
to the plasma membrane (48). PI3K/Akt pathway modulates
transcription factor nuclear factor-nB (NF-nB) activation, which
has been related to tumorigenesis and apoptosis inhibition (49). In
this regard, it is likely that the continuous presence of IL-4 and
IL-10 cytokines in the thyroid cancer microenvironment leads to the
persistent activation of JAK1/STAT6 and PI3K/Akt pathways, which
are in turn responsible for the up-regulation of several antiapoptotic
molecules and refractoriness to CD95-induced and chemotherapeutic drug–induced apoptosis (10).4 We showed that the blockage
of JAK1/STAT6 and PI3K/Akt pathways results in a considerable
reduction of both MUC1 mRNA and MUC1-C protein levels.
Interestingly, when PI3K/Akt pathway is hindered by AktK179M,
muc1 transcription seems to be mainly under the control of JAK/
STAT pathway. Accordingly, we found higher MUC1 mRNA levels in
UTC cells expressing AktK179M than in UTC cells expressing SOCS-1.
Of note, the pattern of expression of MUC1-C in these cells does not
reproduce the levels of MUC1 mRNA observed, suggesting that
inhibition of PI3K/Akt pathway could result in activation of

molecular mechanisms affecting MUC1-C protein half-life. Indeed,
in SOCS-1–infected UTC cells, muc1 transcription is strongly
reduced whereas the constant activation of PI3K/Akt pathway
associates with higher MUC1-C protein levels. Thus, in thyroid
cancer cells, MUC1 overexpression results from the combined
action of JAK1/STAT6 pathway, mainly at transcriptional level, and
PI3K/Akt pathway, which acts at transcriptional level, most likely
through NF-nB, and in the regulation of MUC1 protein half-life.
MUC1 interacts directly with the Wnt pathway effector hcatenin and glycogen synthase kinase 3h (GSK3h; refs. 27, 28).
GSK3h phosphorylates MUC1 cytoplasmic domain on serine in a
SPY site, decreasing the interaction with h-catenin (28). Conversely,
tyrosine phosphorylation of the SPY site increases the formation of
complexes MUC1-h-catenin (26, 29). MUC1-h-catenin complexes
localize in the nucleus of several human carcinoma cells and
function as coactivators of Tcf/LEF-1 target gene transcription (42).
In thyroid cancer, h-catenin plays a direct role in the dedifferentiation commonly observed in late-stage disease (50). Activating
mutations in h-catenin have been shown in late-stage thyroid
tumors and lead to h-catenin nuclear localization and poor
prognosis (50). The considerable activation of the PI3K/Akt
pathway in thyroid cancer cells results in GSK3h phosphorylation
and deactivation and subsequent h-catenin up-regulation (50).
Based on these remarks, MUC1-h-catenin complexes might form
and localize in the nucleus of thyroid cancer cells, contributing to

the malignant phenotype. In addition, overexpression of MUC1 in
the absence of GSK3h activity might inhibit the formation of the
E-cadherin-h-catenin complexes and favor cell migration and
metastasis formation by weakening adherent junctions.
Recent in vitro and in vivo findings have shown that MUC1 downregulation resulted in an increased sensitivity to chemotherapyinduced apoptosis in breast and lung cancers (25). Importantly, we
observed that MUC1 knockdown sensitized UTC cells to apoptosis
induced by cytotoxic agents. Chemotherapy is often the only
possible treatment for highly aggressive tumors, such as undifferentiated thyroid carcinoma (2, 3). Therefore, sensitization of cancer
cells to chemotherapeutic treatment represents one of the most
important goals for an effective approach to such tumors.
Taken together, our results provide new insights into mechanisms
responsible for up-regulation of MUC1 in thyroid cancer and show

that MUC1-C overexpression and mitochondrial localization in
thyroid cancer cells interfere with the induction of the intrinsic
pathway of apoptosis following exposure to anticancer agents. Thus,
MUC1-C down-regulation could be exploited to increase the
effectiveness of conventional chemotherapy in the treatment of
thyroid cancer.
