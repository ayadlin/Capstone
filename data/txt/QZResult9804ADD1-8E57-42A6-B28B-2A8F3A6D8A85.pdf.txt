ABSTRACT
Previously, the authors have identified that c-Met mediates reactivation of the
PI3K/AKT pathway following BRAF inhibitor treatment in BRAF (V600E) mutant
anaplastic thyroid cancer, thereby contributing to the acquired drug resistance.
Therefore dual inhibition of BRAF and c-Met led to sustained treatment response,
thereby maximizing the specific anti-tumor effect of targeted therapy. The present
study goes one step further and aims to investigate the effect of acquired resistance of
BRAF inhibitor on epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in BRAF mutant thyroid
cancer cells and the effect of dual inhibition from combinatorial therapy. Two thyroid
cancer cell lines, 8505C and BCPAP were selected and treated with BRAF inhibitor,
PLX4032 and its effect on EMT were examined and compared. Further investigation
was carried out in orthotopic xenograft mouse models. Unlike BCPAP cells, the BRAF
inhibitor resistant 8505C cells showed increased expressions of EMT related markers
such as vimentin, β-catenin, and CD44. The combinatorial treatment of PLX4032
and PHA665752, a c-Met inhibitor reversed EMT. Similar results were confirmed
in vivo. c-Met-mediated reactivation of the PI3K/AKT pathway contributes to the drug
resistance to PLX4032 in BRAF (V600E) mutant anaplastic thyroid cancer cells and
further promotes tumor cell migration and invasion by upregulated EMT mechanism.
Dual inhibition of BRAF and c-Met leads to reversal of EMT, suggesting a maximal
therapeutic response.

INTRODUCTION

(V600E) mutation being the most common [1,2]. BRAF
(V600E) mutation causes sustained BRAF kinase activity
leading to constitutive activation of MAPK cascade
pathway, and BRAF (V600E) mutation bearing thyroid
cancer presents aggressive clinicopathologic features.

Thyroid cancer is the most common endocrinologic
malignancy. Multiple genetic mutations or alterations are
involved in the tumorigenesis of thyroid cancer, BRAF

BRAF (V600E) mutation is also commonly detected in
other tumors such as melanoma and colorectal cancer
[3,4]. In malignant melanoma, a FDA approved selective
BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib (PLX4032) has shown high
treatment response [5]. However, unlike in metastatic
melanoma, the treatment effects of vemurafenib in BRAF
(V600E) mutant thyroid cancer are often insignificant.
Previously, the authors have elucidated to a
considerable level the causative mechanism underlying
acquired resistance to BRAF inhibition in BRAF
(V600E) mutant thyroid cancer [6]. The previous study
demonstrated differential treatment responses of BRAF
inhibition in different types of thyroid cancer harboring
BRAF (V600E) mutation. On the contrary to the favorable
treatment response in BCPAP, a papillary thyroid cancer
(PTC) cell line, decreased treatment response was noted
in 8505C, an anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) cell line. It
has been identified that c-Met mediates reactivation of the
PI3K/AKT pathway thereby contributing to the acquired
resistance of BRAF inhibition in BRAF mutant ATC
cells. Therefore dual inhibition of BRAF and c-Met led
to sustained treatment response, thereby maximizing the
specific anti-tumor effect of targeted therapy.
Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is
a process where epithelial cells demonstrate changes in
their morphology and motile behavior as they differentiate
into mesenchymal cells. During the EMT, epithelial cells
lose cell to cell contact, undergo cytoskeleton remodeling,
acquire expression of mesenchymal components, and
manifest a migratory phenotype [7,8]. It is generally
accepted that EMT plays a crucial role in the migration,
invasion, and metastasis of cancer.
On the basis of our previous findings, this present
study goes one step further and aims to investigate the
effect of acquired resistance of BRAF inhibitor on EMT
in BRAF mutant thyroid cancer cells. Also we investigated
the effect of dual inhibition from combinatorial therapy on
EMT in BRAF inhibitor-resistant ATC.

more round shapes suggesting epithelial cell phenotype
(Figure 1A). From the live wound healing assays of 8505C
and BCPAP cell lines after PLX4032 treatment, the rate
of wound closure was prominently faster in 8505C cells
(Figure 1B, Supplementary Video S1). This increased
EMT trend could also be verified in transwell migration
assay, where cell invasion was significantly increased in
8505C cells compared to BCPAP cells (Figure 1C).
Western blot analysis in 8505C and BCPAP cells
following PLX4032 treatment revealed that p-c-Met and
p-AKT levels were significantly increased in 8505C cells
together with increased levels of vimentin, β-catenin, and
CD44. These markers however, were unchanged in BCPAP
cells (Figure 2A). Increases of EMT related markers in
8505C were also confirmed in immunofluorescence
confocal microscopy where vimentin, β-catenin, and
CD44 expressions were all increased in 8505C cells
after PLX4032 treatment whereas there was no change in
BCPAP cells (Figure 2B–2D).

RESULTS

When c-Met was knocked down and PLX4032
treated with increasing times, all vimentin, β-catenin,
and CD44 expression levels were markedly decreased,
together with low expressions of p-c-Met, p-AKT, and
p-ERK (Figure 4A).
In accordance with the previous results, vimentin,
β-catenin, and CD44 were over-expressed together
with increased levels of p-c-Met and p-AKT, following
PLX4302 treatment. Whereas there was no change except
for the decrease of p-c-Met upon PHA665752 treatment,
all expression levels of p-c-Met, p-AKT, p-ERK, and EMT
related markers were decreased following combinatorial
treatment of PLX4032 with PHA665752 (Figure 4B).
From the transwell migration assay (Figure 4C), cell
invasion was prominent in PLX4032 single treatment condition
but was not increased following combinatorial treatment of
PLX4032 and PHA665752. Under immunofluorescence

PLX4032 treatment increases EMT via overexpression of PI3K/AKT pathway mediated by
p-c-Met in 8505C
In order to investigate the EMT changes of 8505C
cells under BRAF inhibition, PLX4032 was treated to
8505C cells at different times and different concentrations.
According to increased treatment times of PLX4032, p-cMet expression was significantly increased followed by
increased levels of p-AKT (Figure 3A). Also, markers
of EMT such as vimentin, β-catenin, and CD44 were
consequently increased. The p-c-Met mediated PI3K/AKT
pathway activation leading to over-expression of EMT
markers were also confirmed after treatment of PLX4032
in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 3B).

Dual inhibition of BRAF and c-Met has reversal

Differential effect against EMT is shown in
different BRAF (V600E) mutant thyroid cancer
cell lines to PLX4032 treatment
To evaluate the differential effects of EMT in
two different BRAF (V600E) mutant thyroid cancers,
PLX4032 was treated to 8505C and BCPAP cells which
have each been previously verified as BRAF inhibitorresistant and -sensitive cell lines, respectively. Simple
examination under light microscopy (magnification x20)
after PLX4032 treatment revealed distinct morphological
differences between 8505C and BCPAP cells. That is, the
8505C cells presented long, spindle shaped phenotypes
resembling mesenchymal cell morphology whereas the
BCPAP cells were more closely aggregated together with

confocal microscopic examination, vimentin, β-catenin, and
CD44 expressions were all increased following PLX4032
single treatment however, all markers were barely detectable
following combinatorial treatment of PLX4032 and
PHA665752 (Figure 4D–4F). Furthermore, changes in the
intracellular network of vimentin according to each drug
treatment condition were investigated under 3D confocal
microscopy (Figure 4G). That is, the vimentin expression in
PLX4032 single treatment condition revealed extensively
distributed vimentin network, whereas the intracellular
vimentin was reorganized into perinuclear aggregates
following PLX4032 and PHA665752 combinatorial treatment.

markers were considerably decreased in combinatorial

Histopathological analysis by hematoxylin and eosin
(H & E) staining from tumor specimens of each treatment
group revealed aggressive pathologic features in PLX4032
single treatment group and favorable pathologic features
in combinatorial drug treatment group, with reference to
control (Figure 5B). More specifically, the PLX4032 single
treatment group showed large sized tumor mass with local
infiltration but the combinatorial treatment group showed
small sized tumor mass with extensive necrosis and partial
formation of fibrotic tumor capsule under low power
examination. The control group presented medium sized
mass showing infiltration into adjacent skeletal muscle
with only focal necrosis. Under high power microscopic
examination, viable anaplastic tumor cells were noted in
control and PLX4032 single treatment groups however,
the combinatorial treatment group presented cellular
degenerative changes and decreased cell viability with
extensive necrosis.

expressions of all EMT markers were markedly decreased
in combinatorial drug treatment group.

The tendencies shown in in vitro experiments
were also confirmed in in vivo animal studies. In
concordance with our previous study results, the tumor
volumes and weights were paradoxically larger in the
mice of PLX4032 single treatment group compared to
the control group, but both values were significantly
smaller in the combinatorial treatment group (data not
shown). Considering these changes in tumor size for each
treatment groups, EMT protein expression levels in tumor
specimens of each group were analyzed. All vimentin,

DISCUSSION

and its receptor c-Met are overexpressed in thyroid cancer
and HGF treatment increases thyroid cancer cell motility
through overexpression of EMT markers [33–36]. The
PI3K/AKT pathway is also closely related, since it is
indispensable for HGF-induced EMT [37,38].
In the previous study, the c-Met mediated
reactivation of PI3K/AKT pathway following PLX4032
treatment was identified as the key mechanism underlying
the resistance to BRAF inhibition in ATC [6]. In the
present study, it could be confirmed that the acquired
resistance mechanism also induced the EMT process.
That is, unlike the BRAF inhibitor-sensitive BCPAP
cells, the BRAF inhibitor-resistant 8505C cells presented
upregulated EMT following PLX4032 treatment. The
fundamental causative mechanism for this differential
drug response in different types of BRAF (V600E) mutant
thyroid cancer is unknown and is beyond the scope of
this study but further investigation is warranted. Both
morphological and functional features of mesenchymal
phenotypes were verified, together with elevated
expression of EMT related markers such as vimentin,
β-catenin, and CD44 (Figures 1, 2). Furthermore, the
upregulation of EMT markers following PLX4032
treatment in 8505C were in accordance to increased
levels of p-c-Met and p-AKT (Figure 3) and conversely,
expressions of these EMT related markers were uniformly
decreased both by c-Met knockout and c-Met inhibitor
treatment together with BRAF inhibition (Figure 4). The
EMT reversal effect following combinatorial treatment
of PLX4032 and PHA665752 could also be confirmed
by the decreased cell invasion ability (Figure 4). Besides
the expressional changes, the intracellular network
reorganization of vimentin from EMT is also considered
important [39]. In accordance to previous reports, further
investigation of the vimentin network revealed generalized
intracellular distribution of vimentin in upregulated EMT
state however, the intracellular vimentin was presented
as juxtanuclear caps in EMT reversal status (Figure 4G).
Upregulation of EMT caused by the predilection for PI3K/
AKT pathway following BRAF inhibition is plausible,
considering the aforementioned studies reporting close
associations between HGF/c-Met, PI3K/AKT signaling
and EMT. Already preliminary results of combinatorial
treatment of BRAF inhibitor with an AKT inhibitor in this
setting confirming similar therapeutic responses have been
obtained (data not shown). The results were also verified
in vivo (Figure 5).
There have been previous reports that BRAF
(V600E) mutation stimulates migration and invasion of
thyroid cancer cells, through the increased expression
of EMT-related markers via a MEK/ERK-dependent
mechanism and that these processes together with tumor
proliferation can be inhibited by BRAF inhibitor PLX4720
treatment [40,41]. This however, may not always be the
case, as has been demonstrated in this present study. This
discrepancy in contrary results may be due to the fact that

ATC accounts less than 5% of all thyroid carcinomas
and is considered as a highly virulent malignancy with an
extremely poor prognosis [9,10]. It presents an overall
median survival time of 6 months despite the best
multidisciplinary care and it is associated with an even
graver prognosis in metastatic disease [11]. Even the
differentiated thyroid carcinomas which generally have
an excellent prognosis, show disappointing treatment
outcomes in patients with extensive local invasion or
distant metastases [12,13]. The 5-year survival rate is
merely 50% in patients who presents distant metastases
at initial diagnosis [14,15]. The EMT mechanism is
considered important in the initiation and promotion
of cancer invasion and metastasis. The hallmarks of
EMT include downregulation of epithelial markers and
upregulation of mesenchymal markers, together with
morphological and functional changes of the cell. So
as the epithelial cells lose their apical polarity and cellcell contact and acquire spindle-shaped, fibroblastic cell
phenotypes with increased cell motility, expressions of
N-cadherin, vimentin, fibronectin, and osteopontin are
increased while expression of E-cadherin is decreased
[16–20]. Also, transcription factors including Snail,
Slug, and Twist are activated with nuclear localization of
β-catenin and increased expression of CD44, a stemness
marker implicated in migration and metastasis of cancer
cells [21].
Multiple complex mechanisms are involved in the
EMT process and evidence suggests that the PI3K/AKT
signaling pathway plays a mechanistically important
role in migration and progression of tumors including
thyroid cancer [22,23]. In particular, AKT has shown to
activate cell migration and invasion in thyroid cancer
cell lines [20,24]. That is, intranuclear accumulation of
p-AKT and nuclear exclusion of p27 to the cytoplasm
was directly associated with the invasiveness of thyroid
cancer cells with acquisition of mesenchymal phenotype,
thereby suggesting AKT activation is involved in direct
induction of EMT. Furthermore, this has been suggested
by many others where levels of Snail and Twist and AKT
phosphorylation were also positively correlated in oral
squamous cell carcinoma and prostate carcinoma [25–27].
In head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, PI3K/AKT
activation degrades E-cadherin and promotes cell invasion
and migration [28,29]. In gastric cancer and breast cancer
cells, inhibition of PI3K/AKT signaling pathway repressed
MMP2/MMP9 activation and reduced EMT [30,31].
The PI3K/AKT pathway positively regulates the Wnt/βcatenin signaling pathway by the increase of intracellular
β-catenin levels from AKT phosphorylation which then
induces the movement of β-catenin into the nucleus to bind
with TCF/LEF. This binding ultimately leads to activation
of genes targeted to induce EMT [29,32]. Also, there have
been earlier reports that hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)

we have used a different, more clinically available BRAF
inhibitor drug, PLX4032 (vemurafenib) and at suboptimal
dosage, but nevertheless should receive more attention
since the BRAF inhibitor is not always sensitive in
BRAF (V600E) mutant thyroid cancer in reality. Various
underlying resistance mechanisms against BRAF inhibitor
therapy in thyroid cancer have been investigated in
previous studies [6, 42]. That is, our findings in the present
study would be more applicable to the concept of drug
resistance against BRAF inhibitor and would pose more
valuable clinical implications. The interesting fact that
BRAF inhibition in 8505C cells induces EMT from our
study suggests that sustained BRAF inhibitor treatment
in thyroid cancer would do more harm than good, which
raises an important clinical issue.
Recently it has been shown in numerous reports
that aberrant activation of EMT and an associated cancer
stem cell phenotype are considered a major cause of drug
therapy resistance in aggressive solid tumors such as
pancreatic cancer, lung cancer, and melanoma, particularly
emphasizing the important role of the EMT-activator,
ZEB1 in conferring stemness and resistance [43–46]. This
EMT-related phenotypic change and tumor cell plasticity
shown in the present study therefore, can be suggested
furthermore as another acquired resistance mechanism to
BRAF inhibitor, so further in-depth studies are warranted
to elucidate the precise underlying mechanism.
In summary, this study demonstrates that the
previously confirmed BRAF inhibitor-resistant 8505C
cells showed increased EMT response via acquired
resistance mechanism mediated by the increased
expression of c-Met. Accordingly, the combinatorial
treatment of BRAF inhibitor and c-Met inhibitor reversed
EMT. To our knowledge, this is the first report showing
that acquired drug resistance to BRAF inhibition promotes
not only tumor progression and proliferation, but also
migration and invasion of BRAF (V600E) mutant thyroid
cancer cells through upregulated EMT induced by c-Metmediated AKT activation. Therefore combinatorial
multi-targeted therapy could overcome the limitation
of single agent therapy and maximize anti-tumor effect.
Furthermore it is expected that the PI3K/AKT signaling
pathway will have greater clinical implications by
attracting widespread attention as a potential target for the
prevention and treatment of metastatic cancer.

The in-situ wound healing potentials of thyroid
cancer cells were monitored by live cell imaging
microscopy (DMI6000B, Leica, Bensheim, Germany).
8505C and BCPAP cells (1 × 105 cells/well) were seeded
in a 6-well plate and incubated for 24 h. When seeded cells
were stable in the plate, 8505C and BCPAP cells were each
treated with 1 μM PLX4032, and wound was carefully
made across the cell monolayer by a plastic pipette tip. The
medium was refreshed with complete medium. 1 μg/ ml
mitomycin C was treated to the cells to prevent the cell
proliferation effect. Cells were then incubated in a live cell
chamber (Chamlid HX, LCI, Seoul, Republic of Korea),
connected to a temperature and CO2 controllers (Heating
& Cooling system/CU-301 and Gas mixer/FC-5N, LCI,
Seoul, Republic of Korea). The migratory behavior of cells
was monitored for 2 days after scratching and time-lapse
sequential microscopic images were acquired at intervals
of 30 min. After the complete acquisition of time-lapse live
cell microscopic images, movies were made at 3 frames/
sec (scale bars represent 100 µm). Migration rates of
8505C and BCPAP cells were determined by measuring
the wound closure percentage as defined below:
Wound closure (%) = (migrated cell surface area/
total surface area) x 100, migrated cell surface area =
length of cell migration (mm) x 2 x length, total surface
area = 2.4 mm x length.
For each time frame, the experiments were repeated
three times.

Transwell migration assay
Cell invasion was determined by transwell migration
assay. First, 8505C and BCPAP cells (1 ×105 cells/well)
were seeded in a 6-well plate and drug was treated for
9 h. Meanwhile, 70 μl gel mixture of 1:1 ECM gel and
0.2% RPMI was added in a 24-well transwell chamber
(Corning, Kennebunk, USA) and was kept at 4°C. After
9 h drug treatment, the cells in the 6-well plate were
seeded (3 × 104 cells/100 μl) in the transwell chamber. The
chamber was incubated for 6 h with 5% CO2 at 37°C and
then non-migrant cells left on the upper section of the filter
were removed using a cotton swab. Finally, attached cells
at the lower section were stained with crystal violet and
counted under a light microscope (magnification x 40).

FBS and penicillin-streptomycin supplemented medium
and the cells were incubated at 37°C with 5% CO2 for 48 h.
Subsequently PLX4032 was treated for 9 h and the cells
were harvested and confirmed by Western blot analysis.

3D Confocal microscopy
8505C cells were plated on coverslips at a cell
density of (1 × 105) in a 6-well plate with 18 mm cover
slip and allowed to adhere overnight. On the following
day, 8505C cells were incubated in serum starved medium
for 24 h to induce cell cycle arrest. The cells were then
ﬁxed for 30 min with 4% PFA. Subsequently, the cells
were washed three times with PBS and permeabilized with
0.5% Triton X-100 for 15 min. The cells were washed
three times with blocking buffer (PBS supplemented with
0.1% BSA and 0.001% sodium azide) and incubated for
30 min. The cells were further incubated for 30 min at
22°C with primary antibodies at a 1:200 dilution. After
primary serum incubation, the cells were washed three
times with blocking buffer and incubated with secondary
antibodies at a dilution ratio of 1:500 for 30 min at 22°C.
Finally, the cells were washed again for three times with
PBS. A nucleus staining solution with Hoechst 33342 (Cat
#. H3570, Molecular Probes, Waltham, MA, USA) was
added to a final concentration of 5 mg/mL. The confocal
microscopic images were obtained using a confocal
microscope (LSM-700, Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany) with a
63× objective and ZEN software (version 5.5.0.375, Carl
Zeiss), which was designed for acquisition and processing
of confocal microscopic images.

Cover glasses were coated in a 6-well plate and
1 × 105 cells were seeded. After 24 h, drug was treated to
the seeded cells for 9 h. Then the media was removed and
the cells were washed twice with PBS. Cells were then
fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde (PFA) at room temperature
for 15 min and washed twice. Next the cells were blocked
with mixture of PBS, 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA),
and 10% normal goat serum for 1 h and then treated with
the following primary antibodies, followed by overnight
incubation: vimentin (1:200), β-catenin (1:200), and
CD44 (1:200). The next day, it was thoroughly washed
twice with PBS and then each reacted with the following
secondary antibodies (1:500) for 2 h: Alexa Flour 488
donkey anti-mouse antibody (Invitrogen) and Alexa Flour
488 donkey anti-rabbit antibody (Life Technology). After
further washing with PBS, 10 μl moutin was treated on
the cover glasses and transferred to slides. The stained
cells were then visualized with confocal microscopy (Carl
Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) at 488 nm.

Orthotopic xenograft mouse model
8505C cells were harvested and 1 × 105 cells
were suspended in 5 μl PBS which were then injected
orthotopically in the right thyroid gland of male athymic
nude BALB/c mice, aged 6 weeks (Orientbio Inc.,
Seongnam-si, Korea) with a 25 μl Hamilton syringe
(Hamilton Company, Reno, NV). Tumor formation
was examined at 3 weeks post injection, and the mice
were randomly divided into four groups of four. The
control group was treated with DMSO and the other
3 groups were each injected with PLX4032, PHA665752,
PLX4032 and PHA665752 combination respectively,
3 times a week for 3 weeks. The mice were then
euthanized and Western blot analysis, H&E staining, and
immunohistochemistry analysis were conducted from
specimens. All mice experiments were approved by the
Committee for ethics in animal experiments of Yonsei
University College of Medicine and all experimental
mice were handled in accordance with the Guide for
the care and use of laboratory animals in Department of
laboratory animal resources, Yonsei University College
of Medicine.

Transient transfection of c-Met and RNA
interference (siRNA)
3 × 104 cells per well were seeded onto 6-well
culture dishes containing 2 ml antibiotic-free medium
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS).
Next, 500 μl optimum and 10 μl RNAiMAX, and 500 μl
optimum and 5 μl RNAi were mixed and left at room
temperature for 5 min, and then mixed together. siRNAs
for the control and c-Met (BIONEER sense: 100451
antisense:100451) were then mixed and after 20 min,
droplets of the mixture were applied at the cells and left to

The tumor tissue specimens obtained from mice
were processed for paraffin section and deparaffinized
consequently with xylene and ethanol. Antigen retrieval
was done for 15 min followed by reaction with H2O2 for
10 min and blocking (10% normal goat serum + 0.01%
BSA + dilution) for 1 h. The slides were then incubated
overnight at 4°C with primary anti-vimentin, β-catenin, and
CD44 antibody (1:200). Next, the slides were treated with
secondary anti-rabbit antibodies (1:500) for 1 h and reacted
using DAB histochemistry kit (Life technologies, Rockford,
IL). Finally the slides were stained with hematoxylin and
processed with mounting solution (DAKO) and visualized
using a Nikon light microscope. Microscopic images were
captured and processed using AxioCam digital microscope
camera and AxioVision Image processing software (Carl
Zeiss Vision, Oberkochen, Germany).

Statistical analysis
All data were obtained from triplicate independent
experiments, and the parameters were represented as
means ± SD. Student’s t-test and one-way ANOVA were
performed using SPSS 20.0 statistical software (SPSS,
Chicago, IL, USA). A p < 0.05 was considered statistically
significant (*p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001).
