ABSTRACT
Recently we reported that gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) inhibit ovarian tumor
growth and metastasis in mice by reversing epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT).
Since EMT is known to confer drug resistance to cancer cells, we wanted to investigate
whether anti-EMT property of AuNP could be utilized to sensitize ovarian cancer
cells to cisplatin. Herein, we report that AuNPs prevent cisplatin-induced acquired
chemoresistance and stemness in ovarian cancer cells and sensitize them to cisplatin.
AuNPs inhibit cisplatin induced EMT, decrease the side population cells and key stem
cell markers such as ALDH1, CD44, CD133, Sox2, MDR1 and ABCG2 in ovarian cancer
cells. Mechanistically, AuNPs prevent cisplatin-induced activation of Akt and NF-κB
signaling axis in ovarian cancer cells that are critical for EMT, stem cell maintenance
and drug resistance. In vivo, AuNPs sensitize orthotopically implanted ovarian
tumor to a low dose of cisplatin and significantly inhibit tumor growth via facilitated
delivery of both AuNP and cisplatin. These findings suggest that by depleting stem
cell pools and inhibiting key molecular pathways gold nanoparticles sensitize ovarian
cancer cells to cisplatin and may be used in combination to inhibit tumor growth and
metastasis in ovarian cancer. 

INTRODUCTION

mesenchymal transition (EMT) plays critical roles in
ovarian cancer progression including increasing migration
and invasion ability [3,4], contributing to chemoresistance
acquisition [5,6] which could give rise to recurrence and
metastasis after standard chemotherapeutic treatment. In
addition, EMT and acquisition of chemoresistance are
also believed to correlate with “cancer stem-like cells”
which represent the most tumorigenic and treatmentresistant cells within a heterogeneous tumor mass [7-10].
Interestingly, Yew and colleagues recently reported that
epimorphin reverted ovarian cancer cells away from a
mesenchymal phenotype toward an epithelial phenotype,
thereby enhancing sensitivity to carboplatin [11].
Therefore, targeting EMT offers an attractive therapeutic

Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is one of the
deadliest gynecological malignancies of women in the
western world. Primary management includes an extensive
surgical debulking followed by combination chemotherapy
including platinum and taxane based regimen. Despite
frequent initial responses indicating sensitivity to
platinum agent, most patients with advanced stage disease
eventually develop platinum resistance which leads to low
responsiveness to any agents and shortened survival [1,2].
Therefore, overcoming platinum resistance is an urgent
need in the therapeutic management of EOC.

option for overcoming drug resistance in ovarian cancer
patients.
Over the past decade, nanotechnology has
received considerable attention for cancer therapy [1214]. It provides a unique approach and comprehensive
technology against cancer because of the special optical,
magnetic, or structural properties of the nanometer-sized
particles [15-19]. Our group has demonstrated that 20
nm gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) inhibited proliferation,
angiogenesis and metastases in a preclinical mouse model
of ovarian cancer [12,20,21]. At the molecular level,
treatment with AuNPs altered the profiles of a series of
secretory cytokines [18], a majority of which are key
elements in regulating signaling related to EMT and stem
cell maintenance. Owing to these unique and remarkable
properties, we postulated that a low dose of AuNPs could
be utilized to sensitize ovarian tumors to chemotherapy
such as cisplatin. Herein, we show that pretreatment with
AuNPs prevented cisplatin-induced chemoresistance
acquisition by depleting the stem cell pool, downregulating
multidrug resistance gene and inhibiting NF-κB/Akt
signaling. The present work provides a new therapeutic
strategy to intervene in relapsed and refractory ovarian
cancer cases, therapeutic management of which is still an
overwhelming challenge.

AuNPs sensitize cancer cells to chemotherapeutics
in vitro
We previously demonstrated that AuNPs exhibited
an anti-tumorigenic effect in ovarian cancer in a size and
dose dependent manner [12,20] and reversed EMT. Since
EMT plays a critical role in drug resistance, we wanted to
investigate whether AuNPs could sensitize ovarian cancer
cells to cisplatin. After 24 hours exposure to a low dose
of 20 nm AuNPs (5µg) (physicochemical characterization
is provided in Fig. S1), ovarian cancer cells were treated
with various concentration of cisplatin for an additional
24 hours. Significant reduction (2-5 fold) in the 50%
inhibitory concentration (IC50) of cisplatin was observed
in AuNP pretreated A2780, OVCAR5 and SKOV3-ip
cells (Fig. 1 A-D), indicating that treatment with AuNPs
significantly sensitize ovarian cancer cells to cisplatin.

AuNP prevents cisplatin-induced EMT
EMT is one of the main mechanisms underlying
development of tumor growth and metastasis, which

induces stem-like properties and confers drug resistance
to tumor cells [22,23]. Previously, we reported that AuNPs
reversed EMT both in vitro and in vivo, therefore, we
hypothesized that pretreatment with AuNPs could inhibit
cisplatin-induced EMT, a process critically required for
chemoresistance acquisition. We next determined the
expression profile of several EMT markers in various
ovarian cancer cell lines with or without cisplatin and
AuNP treatment. Incubation with cisplatin led to a
significant up-regulation of mesenchymal markers such
as vimentin and α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) and
down-regulation of epithelial markers such as E-cadherin
and/or β-Catenin simultaneously (Fig. 2 A). In addition,
pretreatment with AuNPs significantly blunted the EMTinducing effect of cisplatin by decreasing expression of
EMT markers (Fig. 2 A). To observe this morphological
transition, E-cadherin and F-actin in SKOV3-ip cells
was visualized by immunofluorescence. Both F-Actin
and E-Cadherin were recruited to cellular junctions
from cytosol after being treated by AuNP alone (Fig. 2
B). Interestingly, cisplatin treatment disrupted filopodialike cell-cell contacts as visualized by F-actin staining,
supporting induction of a mesenchymal phenotype.
Importantly, pretreatment with AuNPs prevented cisplatininduced EMT and exhibited up-regulation of E-Cadherin/
β-Catenin and down-regulation of vimentin and α-SMA
compared to the cells treated by cisplatin alone, although
most of the E-cadherin was still localized in the cytosol

(Fig. 2 A and B).

AuNP suppresses cancer stem cell properties
Acquired chemoresistance in ovarian cancer is
associated with EMT and a more cancer stem cell-like
(CSC) phenotype [7,9]. Therefore, we investigated
whether AuNPs prevented cisplatin-induced enrichment of
CSC pools, and if enrichment of cellular stemness could
be a plausible mechanism for acquired chemoresistance
in ovarian cancer cells. Up-regulation of MDR1 and
ABCG2 expression is one of the hallmarks of acquired
chemoresistance. As seen in Fig. 3 A-C, treatment with
cisplatin dramatically increased the expression of MDR1.
This increase was however inhibited upon pretreatment
of the cells with AuNP. To gain deeper insight into the
induction of stemness by cisplatin and the effect of
AuNP pretreatment, we conducted quantitative RTPCR experiments for a few candidate stem cell markers
[8,24,25] in ovarian cancer cells. The results showed that
pretreatment with AuNPs significantly prevented cisplatininduced up-regulation of a number of key stem-cell
markers, including ALDH1, CD133, EpCAM, c-Kit and
Sox-2 in A2780 cells; ALDH1, CD24, c-Kit and Sox-2 in
OVCAR5 cells; and ALDH1, CD44, EpCAM and Sox-2
in SKOV3-ip cells (Fig. 3 D-F). These results suggest that
AuNPs may potentially prevent cisplatin-induced acquired
stemness in ovarian cancer cells.

antibody, respectively. Then the localization of E-cadherin and F-actin were visualized by immunofluorescence microscopy.

Next we sought to investigate whether prevention
of cisplatin-induced stemness by AuNP actually leads
to the depletion of stem cell like pools by analyzing the
side population of ovarian cancer cells after only cisplatin
treatment and cisplatin treatment after AuNP pretreatment.
It is long known that the side population (SP) of ovarian
cancer cells engender stem-like characteristics [26]
including chemoresistance [7,9]. Therefore, the cells were
stained with DyeCycle Violet dye and the stem-like cells
were evaluated by side population analysis. According
to Fig. 3 G, there is a marked increase in the percentage
of SP cells upon treatment of A2780 cells with cisplatin.
While the non-treated A2780 control cells have ~ 3 % SP
cells, treatment with cisplatin enriched the SP cell pool to
~13 %. Importantly, pretreatment with AuNPs prevented
cisplatin-induced enrichment of SP cells and reduced it to
~ 9 %. A similar trend was also observed with OVCAR5
and SKOV3-ip cells. Taken together, these results
demonstrated that pretreatment with AuNPs reduced
cisplatin-induced acquired ‘stemness’ and enrichment of
CSC like SP cells in ovarian cancer, which may be the
mechanism of cisplatin sensitization by AuNP.

well as chemoresistance [23,27-30]. In addition, NFκB activation by cisplatin has been reported in various
cancers [31-33]. Moreover, salinomycin, an eliminator
of CSCs, inhibited Akt/NF-κB signaling in cisplatinresistant ovarian cancer cells [34]. Hence perturbation
of the Akt/NF-κB pathway by AuNP in cisplatin-induced
cells could explain the loss of acquired chemoresistance
and ‘stemness’ in ovarian cancer cells. It is evident
from Fig. 4 A-C that incubation with cisplatin prompted
degradation of IκBα in ovarian cancer cells with a
concomitant increase in NF-κB p65 levels in the nuclear
fraction (Fig. 4 A-C). In agreement with western blotting,
cisplatin treatment increased NF-κB-luciferase activity
by 50% in OVCAR5, and more than 150% in A2780 and
SKOV3-ip cells (Fig. 4 D). However, pretreatment with
AuNPs prevented cisplatin-induced degradation of IκBα
and thus an increase in IκBα levels were observed upon
AuNP pretreatment (Fig. 4 A-C). Consequently, AuNPpretreatment also led to a decrease in NF-κB p65 levels in
the nuclear fraction (Fig. 4 A-C). A significant decrease in
luciferase activity was observed in all the three cell lines,
further confirming the prevention of cisplatin-induced
NF-κB activation upon AuNP-pretreatment (Fig. 4 D).
Therefore, NF-κB signaling might be involved in AuNPmediated sensitization of ovarian cancer cells to cisplatin.
Akt can activate NF-κB via regulating I-κB kinase
(IKK), and can cross-talk with MAPK resulting in
transcription of pro-survival genes. Our previous work

demonstrated that AuNPs inhibited ovarian cancer cells
proliferation and tumor growth by abrogating MAPKsignaling [20]. Therefore, we determined whether the
Akt signaling was regulated by cisplatin and/or AuNPs in
ovarian cancer cells. According to Fig. 4 A-C, cisplatin
significantly induced activation of Akt although the
total Akt levels did not change. Mechanistically, AuNPs
treatment decreased cisplatin-induced Akt activation.
Taken together, AuNP induced sensitization of cisplatin
to ovarian cancer cells is most likely through inhibition of

cisplatin at 500 µg/kg body weight or HBSS on alternate
days. On day 22, the mice were euthanized and the tumors
and nodules were collected for further analysis. A notable
decrease in bioluminescence of the groups treated with
AuNP or cisplatin (Cis) compared to the HBSS control
group (Fig. 5 A) was noted. However, the group pretreated
with AuNPs followed by cisplatin (Cis+AuNPs) showed
the highest growth retardation of the tumors and the
weakest bioluminescence signal (Fig. 5 A and B). The
health of the mice in each group was monitored daily. As
shown in Fig. S2 A, the weight gain of the mice is typical
over the study period, indicating that the dose schedule for
each group was non-toxic.
The regression in tumor growth was confirmed by
measuring the tumor mass and volume at the end of the
study (Fig. 5 C and D, Fig. S2 and S3). The Cis+AuNPs
group showed the tightest cluster of data points as well as
the highest therapeutic effect among all the groups (Fig.
S2 B and C). Uptake of AuNP and cisplatin showed about
50% increase in the Cis+AuNPs group (Fig. 5 E and F).
Moreover, nodule mass and volume had also decreased
and a 50% decrease in nodule formation was noticed
compared to the HBSS group (P<0.001; Fig. S2 B-D).
Growth regression was further confirmed by
quantifying the number of proliferating cells using
Ki67 staining (Fig. 6 A and B). A significant decrease

AuNP enhances cisplatin sensitivity in vivo

ovarian tumor growth in AuNP treated animals. We

to cisplatin both in vitro and in vivo.
To identify epithelial cells undergoing EMT in vivo,
xenograft tumor tissues from mice were immunostained
for the mesenchymal marker α-SMA. This antibody
recognizes both myofibroblasts and blood vessels (Fig. 6
D, Fig. S4). Alpha-SMA stained blood vessels depicted a
distinct staining pattern (Fig. S4) and were excluded from
quantitation in order to evaluate EMT. The percentage
of α-SMA positive fibroblast-like cells significantly
decreased in the AuNP treated group (Fig. 6 D and E).
Although the tumor growth was comparable in the
Cisplatin and AuNP group (Fig. 5 C and D), the percentage
of α-SMA positive fibroblast-like cells was significantly
lower in the AuNP group (Fig. 6 D and E). Together, these
data suggest that pretreatment with AuNP decreased the
efficacy of cisplatin-induced EMT in xenograft ovarian
tumors in vivo.

in Ki-67 staining was observed in the treatment groups
as compared to the control HBSS group. However, no
significant difference between the single therapy treated
groups (AuNP vs. Cis) and the two groups treated with
cisplatin (Cis vs. Cis+AuNPs) was observed. Interestingly,
there was a remarkable difference (P<0.001) between
the nanoparticle treated groups (AuNP vs. Cis+AuNPs).
Priming the tumors with 20 nm AuNPs may allow for
normalization and remodeling of the tumor vasculature
thus permitting small molecules, such as cisplatin, to be
effectively delivered [17]. To evaluate this, CD31 staining
was performed. There was a 50% decrease of cells positive
for CD31 in the single therapy groups (AuNP and Cis)
compared to the HBSS treated group and 75% decrease in
cells positive for CD31 in the Cis+AuNPs group (Fig. 6
A and C). Remarkably, there is a 50% difference between
the AuNP+Cis group and the single therapy groups with
the biggest significance being between Cis+AuNPs and
the Cis only group (P<0.001). All of this data convincingly
demonstrated that AuNPs sensitized ovarian cancer cells

DISCUSSION

AuNPs might be used clinically with lower dose cisplatin
thus reducing the nephrotoxicity.
Most interestingly, we show that cisplatin treatment
downregulated epithelial markers such as E-Cadherin
and β-Catenin, and upregulated mesenchymal markers
such as vimentin and α-SMA, implying that an EMTlike phenotype was induced by cisplatin, which is
in accordance with recent reports [20]. However,
pretreatment with AuNPs attenuated this EMT process.
Taken together, these results suggest that at least one of
the mechanisms by which AuNPs sensitize the cells to
cisplatin might be through reversal of EMT.
Since EMT has the potential to confer stemlike properties to a subpopulation of cancer cells that
would be resistant to chemotherapeutics, we next tested
whether the resistance to cisplatin correlated with CSCs
in ovarian cancer cells. Cisplatin treatment upregulated
the expression of several stem cell markers such as
ALDH1, CD24, CD44, CD133, EpCAM, Nanog, Oct4 and Sox2, and increased the SP simultaneously. Also
pretreatment with AuNPs prevented cisplatin-induced
acquired ‘stemness’ and enrichment of SP cells. To our
knowledge, our data for the first time demonstrated that
AuNP inhibited the expression of stem cell markers and
reduced the pool of side population cells. Exploring the
signaling that regulates AuNP-mediated inhibition of
stemness will help to identify key players involved in the
cisplatin resistant and develop AuNP-based combination
therapy. Recent reports demonstrated that nanoparticles
could induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and
reactive oxygen species (ROS) production [40,41].
Interestingly, several groups reported that endoplasmic
reticulum (ER) stress led to the loss of epithelial stemness
[42,43]. Furthermore, ROS has also been implicated in
chemoresistance in various cancers [44,45]. Therefore, it
is possible that AuNPs might inhibit epithelial stemness
through the induction of ER stress.
The Akt/NF-κB signaling axis is critical in
regulating cell survival, EMT, CSCs as well as resistance
to chemotherapeutics. Reports from several groups have
highlighted the potential use of combination therapy
involving cisplatin and Akt/NF-κB inhibitors [31,33].
Recently salinomycin, an eliminator of CSCs, has been
demonstrated to inhibit Akt/NF-κB in cisplatin resistant
ovarian cancer cells [34]. Here, we demonstrate that
cisplatin treatment activated Akt/NF-κB signaling in
ovarian cancer cells and pretreatment with AuNPs
attenuated this effect. Therefore, inhibition of Akt/NF-κB
signaling by AuNPs provides an inorganic nanomaterial
based therapeutic approach for sensitizing cells to cisplatin
by decreasing EMT and stemness and thus may play an
important role in therapeutic management of ovarian
cancer. In this context activation of the Akt/NF-κB
signaling could be due to activation of survival pathways
post cisplatin stress or due to enrichment of the growth
factor signaling in stem cell populations, as demonstrated

Since 1980 cisplatin and its analogues have
remained the backbone of systemic therapy for EOC with
recent advances being a change in the mode of delivery
to intraperitoneal. Although ovarian cancer is among
the most chemosensitive malignancies at the time of
initial treatment by surgery and taxane/platinum-based
therapy, most patients ultimately relapse and succumb
to chemoresistant disease [1,2,35]. Furthermore, front
line chemotherapy is associated with toxicities and may
adversely impact the quality of life [36]. Given this
disappointing situation, our aim was to first test if AuNPs
could enhance the efficacy of cisplatin by sensitizing EOC
and secondly to investigate the underlying molecular
mechanisms.
Several lines of evidence suggest that the
heterogeneous cancer cells employ a dynamic survival
strategy in which a small subpopulation assume a
reversible drug-tolerant state that can protect the
population from eradication by potentially lethal exposures
[37]. EMT reflects such an adaptation conferring stemlike properties to cancer cells, leading to resistance to
cytotoxic drugs and metastasis [3-6,20,38]. Since AuNP
treatment reversed EMT in cancer cells by reducing
secretion of TGF-β, bFGF and uPA, proteins involved
in EMT, up-regulating E-Cadherin, and down-regulating
Snail, N-Cadherin, and Vimentin both in vitro and in vivo
[20], we hypothesized that AuNPs can potentially act as
a multifunctional molecule to increase sensitivity of cells
towards cisplatin.
In this study, we demonstrate that AuNPs sensitized
cancer cells to cisplatin in vitro and in vivo. In order to
understand a role of AuNP in pruning cancer cells to
cisplatin, we utilized a low concentration of AuNP (5 µg/
ml) based on our previous study that resulted in a modest
10-15 % inhibition of proliferation of ovarian cancer
cell lines [20]. Among the three cell lines tested for in
vitro studies, we selected SKOV3-ip cells for the in vivo
study because they demonstrated lowest sensitization
in in vitro studies. Also, our previous study showed that
SKOV3-ip cells metastasized into the peritoneal cavity
after orthotopic implantation into the ovarian bursa and
an intraperitoneal administration of 200 µg of AuNP
per animal inhibited tumor growth and metastasis [20].
Therefore, in this work we decided to use a low dose,
100 µg of AuNP/animal/treatment, to determine a role
in cisplatin sensitization in vivo. At clinically relevant
concentrations cisplatin mediated nephrotoxicity is a major
stumbling block in therapy [39]. For this reason we utilized
cisplatin at 500µg/kg/dose, a concentration about 10 times
lower than usual preclinical doses. We demonstrated that
pretreatment with AuNPs enhanced cisplatin efficacy
both in vitro and in vivo. In addition, uptake of AuNPs and
cisplatin were observed to be increased in the AuNP and
cisplatin combination group (Fig. 5 E and F). Therefore,

for TGF-β, bFGF and uPA that AuNP inhibits [20].
After decades of efforts, mechanisms underlying
cisplatin resistance has been considered to be multifactorial
that includes changes in drug transport, DNA repair and
damage as well as alterations in cell death / apoptosis
pathways [46]. One major problem for overcoming this
clinically relevant issue is that more than one resistance
mechanism is activated. In view of these considerations,
it might be a more successful strategy for circumventing
resistance by targeting multiple mechanisms. The distinct
properties of AuNP in antiangiogenesis, reversing
EMT, inhibiting “stemness”, and enhancing cisplatin
uptake make it as an efficient candidate for overcoming
chemoresistance. Because of the low toxicity, gold-based
compounds have long been used as anti-inflammatory
agents to treat rheumatoid arthritis [47]. Therefore, gold
nanoparticles may potentially alleviate the side effects of
cisplatin and be used in combination to inhibit ovarian
tumor growth and metastasis in the clinic.
Although a promising strategy, the use of cisplatin
and AuNPs combination for anticancer therapy still faces
some important challenges. First, more pre-clinical studies
are still required to assess the safety of nanoparticles at the
whole animal level, in vivo. Second, as the combination
treatment increases the uptake of both AuNPs and
cisplatin, therapeutic agents are able to reach the targeted
area as well as normal tissues. To avoid unwanted toxicity,
optimizing the mode of administration and drug dosage
may be necessary. Similar to pharmaceutical drugs,
studying the pharmacokinetics of nanoparticles in vivo
to assess their absorption, biodistribution, metabolism,
elimination processes is essential. In addition, specific
tissue-level toxicological studies are also required,
which include the hepatotoxicity (liver), nephrotoxicity
(kidney), immunogenicity, hematological toxicity (blood),
and inflammatory and oxidative responses due to the
nanoparticles.
In summary, we demonstrate here that exposure
to exogenous AuNP is capable of inducing an epitheliallike phenotype in the ovarian cancer cells exhibiting
mesenchymal features. Pruning the cells with AuNP
prevents enrichment of stem cell pools, reduces expression
of multidrug resistance genes and inhibits critical signaling
pathways required for stem cell maintenance, EMT and
drug resistance. Thus, the present report supports that gold
nanoparticle performs as a molecular ‘brake’ that prevents
cisplatin induced ‘run-away’ activation of Akt/NF-κB
pathways leading to acquired stemness and drug resistance
phenotype. The property of AuNPs to sensitize ovarian
cancer cells to a low dose cisplatin may alleviate the
potential dose limiting toxicity and extend the therapeutic
application in a broad range of cancers that warrants
further clinical investigation.

from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.

Cell Culture
The human ovarian cancer cell lines A2780,
OVCAR5 and SKOV3-ip were purchased from American
Type Culture Collection and grown in recommended
completed growth medium.

IC50 Assay
Ovarian cancer cells were plated in 2- 24 well
plates with a density of 2 × 104 cell per well and were
allowed to grow overnight under standard conditions.
The following morning, growth medium was replaced by
starving medium and the cells were allowed to grow under
normal conditions. After 24 hours, the starving medium
was replaced with fresh starving medium and 5µg/ ml
of 20 nm AuNP was added to one of 24-well plate (sans
the control wells) and returned to the incubator under
normal conditions. In the following 24 hours, the starving
medium was replaced with fresh starving medium and
various doses of cisplatin was added to each well (ranging
from 0.5 µM to 20 µM) and returned to the incubator.
Following treatment, 1 μCi [3H]thymidine was added; 4 h
later cells were washed with chilled PBS, fixed with 100%
cold methanol, and collected for measurement of TCAprecipitable radioactivity. Experiments were repeated at
least three separate times, with each repeat performed in
triplicate. IC50 values were determined using GraphPad
Prism. Statics were done using a two-tailed paired t-test.

Total RNA Isolation, cDNA Synthesis and
Quantitative Real-Time PCR Analysis

DyeCycle Violet for 2 hrs at 37°C with gentle mixing at
30 min intervals. The side population cells were counted
using BD LSR II Analyzer and the data were analyzed by
FlowJo software.

Total RNA was isolated from cell lines following
manufacturers’ instructions (Qiagen). The quality of RNA
was assessed with SPECTROStarNano (BMG Labtech Inc.),
and cDNA was synthesized using the Transcriptor First
Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Roche Applied Science).
Quantitative real-time PCR was conducted in triplicate
for each gene of interest using SYBR Green dye and the
protocol provided by Clontech. Gene expression levels
were measured in an ABI PRISM 7300HT Sequence
Detection System (Applied Biosystems). Relative
quantification of target genes was calculated using the
comparative cycle threshold (CT) method (2−ΔΔCT) with
genes normalized to GAPDH. The sequences of the
primers were listed in Table S1.

Fabrication of 20 nm AuNP
Citrate AuNPs were prepared as previously
reported [49]. In a 250 mL flask, 2.5 mL of a 10 mM
tetrachloroauric acid trihydrate (HAuCl4) in 90 mL water
was heated to boil with vigorous stirring. Once boiling,
7.5 mL of preheated 1% sodium citrate was added rapidly.
This solution was left to boil for an additional 10 min,
at which point it was removed from heat and allowed
to cool to room temperature while stirring. The size of
the nanoparticles was determined from analysis of the
dynamic light scattering (DLS) (Malvern Zetasizer Nano
ZS). Zeta potential measurements were done using a
clear zeta disposable capillary (Malvern DTS1061). The
AuNPs were concentrated by centrifuge at 10 °C for 20
min before each use and the concentration was measured
by SPECTROStarNano (BMG Labtech Inc.).

Western Blot Analysis
Cells were lysed by RIPA buffer with proteinase
inhibitors and the total proteins concentration was
determined using BCA kit (Thermo Scientific). 20 µg
cell lysates were electrophoresed through 4-20% gradient
denaturing polyacrylamide gels (BioRad) and transferred
to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore). The
blots were probed with primary antibodies, and bound
antibody was detected using enhanced chemiluminescence
(Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
Primary antibody dilution was a 1:1000 for N-Cadherin,
vimentin, IκBα, p65, NUP214, α-SMA and Akt1/2/3;
1:2000 for β-Catenin; 1:4000 for E-Cadherin; 1:20000 for
β-Actin; and 1:500 for phos-Akt1/2/3. Secondary antibody
dilution factors were 1:10000.

Measurement of Gold Content by Instrumental
Neutron Activation Analysis (INAA)
Samples were analyzed by INAA as previously
described [12]. Briefly, samples were transferred with
100 microliters of 18 MOhm water into a pre-cleaned,
high-density polyethylene irradiation vials, lyophilized to
constant dry weight and mass recorded. Samples were then
loaded in polyethylene transfer “rabbits” and irradiated for
90 s in a thermal flux density of ~5×1013 n∙cm2∙s-1.

Measurement of Cisplatin Content by Inductively
Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS)

Immunofluorescence Microscopy
Cells were grown on coverslips, washed
with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), fixed in 4%
paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 15 min,
washed, permeabilized for 15 min with 0.2% Triton
X-100, and blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin
(BSA) in PBS for 30 min at room temperature. The
coverslips were incubated sequentially with appropriate
primary (E-cadherin, 1:500) and secondary antibodies
for fluorescence observation using a Zeiss Axiovert 200m
Inverted Fluorescent Microscope.

Uptake of cisplatin was determined by IPC-MS as
[50] with modifications. The tumor fractions were digested
overnight in 3 ml HNO3 and 1 ml H2O2. On the next day,
1 ml of aqua regia was added, and then the sample was
allowed to react for another 1-2 hrs. The sample solution
was then diluted to 100 mL with de-ionized water, and
aqua regia (final concentration: 5%). Then the sample
solution was measured by ICP-MS on a Perkin Elmer
Elan 6100. Cisplatin uptake experiments were repeated 3
times, and each replicate was measured 10 times by ICPMS. A series of cisplatin solutions were prepared before
each experiment. The resulting calibration line was used to
determine the amount of cisplatin in each fraction.

Side Population Assay
The side population was analyzed as previously
reported [48]. Briefly, the cells were collected and
suspended in DMEM with 2% FBS at the concentration
of 106 cells/ml. Then the cells were incubated with 5 µM

Immunohistochemistry

assessing tumor growth/ regression in these animals, mice
were sacrificed by CO2 inhalation with tumors and tissue
harvested for further analysis.

Xenograft tumor samples were fixed in 10%
formalin solution for 24 hours and transferred to
70% ethanol. Then tissues were embedded in paraffin
wax according to embedding machine manufactures
instructions. And 4-µm sections were prepared.
Immunohistochemistry was performed according to
standard protocols. Antigen retrieval was achieved by
heating sections in 95 ˚C citrate buffer for 10 minutes.
Sections were incubated with specific antibodies overnight
at 4 ˚C. For CD31 (1:100) and Ki67 (1:100) staining, the
dark brown signal was revealed after incubation with the
ABC kit (Vector), followed by a diaminobenzidine (DAB)
and hydrogen peroxide reaction using the DAB detection
kit (Vector). Counterstaining was performed by incubating
the slides in Hematoxylin for 5min. For α-SMA (1:200)
staining, Alexa fluor 568-conjugated secondary antibody
was used. The nuclei were visualized by incubation with
DAPI, and images were examined with a fluorescent
microscope. Appropriate controls were used in all cases by
incubating sections with all except the primary antibodies.
No staining was observed under these conditions.

Statistical analysis
All values are expressed as means ± SD. Statistical
significance was determined using two-tailed paired t test
between two groups. For animal experiments, 9 ~ 10 mice
were assigned per treatment group. Significance between
treatment groups was determined using a proposed a oneway ANOVA model using Tukey.

Preclinical Model of Ovarian Cancer
Female athymic nude mice (NCr-nu; 6 to 8 wks
old) were purchased from the National Cancer InstituteFrederick Cancer Research and Development Center
(Frederick, MD). All mice were housed and maintained
under specific pathogen-free conditions in facilities
approved by the American Association for Accreditation
of Laboratory Animal Care and in accordance with
current regulations and standards of the U.S. Department
of Agriculture, U.S. Department of Health and Human
Services, and NIH. All studies were approved and
supervised by the Mayo Clinic Institutional Animal Care
and Use Committee.
For the generation of orthotopic ovarian tumor
models, SKOV3-ip cells containing luciferase were
injected into the ovaries of nude mice. 4 days post
tumor inoculation, tumor growth was imaged using a
the Xenogen-IVIS. The mice were randomized into 4
treatment groups (n=10): (i) HBSS only, (ii) 20nm AuNP
only (100 µg), (iii) Cisplatin only (500µg/kg) and (iv)
Cis+AuNPs (500 µg/kg and 100µg, respectively). After
randomization, mice were injected into the peritoneum
with 100 µg of 20 nm citrate capped AuNPs. The AuNP
treatments were thrice/week for a period of 3 weeks.
Subsequent cisplatin injections were also performed
thrice/week 24 hours after AuNP treatments. Mice weights
were recorded weekly and their health/ behaviors were
monitored daily. Efficacies of the treatment groups were
compared with the control groups where mice were
treated only with HBSS. After the final treatment and
