Annexin 1 Induced by Anti-Inflammatory Drugs Binds
to NF-κB and Inhibits Its Activation: Anticancer
Effects In vitro and In vivo
Zhiquan Zhang, Liqun Huang, Wenping Zhao, and Basil Rigas

Abstract
Annexin A1 (ANXA1), a mediator of the anti-inflammatory action of glucocorticoids, is important in cancer
development and progression, whereas NF-κB regulates multiple cellular phenomena, some of them associated with inflammation and cancer. We showed that glucocorticoids and chemopreventive modified nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as nitric oxide–donating aspirin (NO-ASA) and phospho-aspirin, induced
ANXA1 in cultured human colon and pancreatic cancer cells. ANXA1 associated with NF-κB and suppressed
its transcriptional activity by preventing NF-κB binding to DNA. The induction of ANXA1 by glucocorticoids
was proportional to their anti-inflammatory potency, as was the suppression of NF-κB activity, which was
accompanied by enhanced apoptosis and inhibition of cell growth mediated by changes in NF-κB–dependent
cell signaling. The proposed novel mechanism was operational in the intestinal mucosa of mice treated with
dexamethasone or NO-ASA. ANXA1-based oligopeptides displayed the same effects as ANXA1 on NF-κB. One
such tripeptide (Gln-Ala-Trp) administered to nude mice inhibited the growth of SW480 human colon cancer
xenografts by 58% compared with control (P < 0.01). Our findings reveal that ANXA1 is an inducible endogenous inhibitor of NF-κB in human cancer cells and mice, provide a novel molecular mechanism for the
action of anti-inflammatory agents, and suggest the possibility of mechanism-driven drug development.

Introduction
Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) have
emerged as important agents for the prevention of several
human cancers (1). A derivative of aspirin, nitric oxide–
donating aspirin (NO-ASA), consisting of aspirin and a NOdonating moiety covalently attached to it, prevents various
cancers in preclinical models and displays anti-inflammatory
properties (2). Inhibition of NF-κB by NO-ASA seems important for its chemopreventive effect; NO-ASA inhibits NF-κB
in various cancer cell lines and animal models of cancer (3).
NF-κB plays a role in autoimmune responses, cell proliferation, and apoptosis and represents a plausible link between
inflammation and carcinogenesis (4, 5). NF-κB is sequestered
inactive in the cytoplasm bound to IκB proteins, an interaction that regulates its activity. Multiple stimuli activate
NF-κB signaling, which consists of translocation of NF-κB

to the nucleus where it binds to κB binding sites in the enhancer or promoter regions of target genes, regulating their
transcription (6, 7). The NF-κB signal transduction pathway
is dysregulated in various human cancers (8, 9). In most such
cases, NF-κB is constitutively active and resides in the nucleus, whereas in others the enhanced NF-κB activity is due to
changes in the IκB kinase pathway. The sustained NF-κB activation not only protects cancer cells from apoptotic cell
death but may also enhance their proliferation.
While studying the mechanism by which NO-ASA suppresses NF-κB activation, we noted that NO-ASA induces
the expression of Annexin A1 (ANXA1), a 37-kDa protein
originally identified as a mediator of the anti-inflammatory
effect of glucocorticoids (10). ANXA1 has diverse functions,
including the regulation of cell division, apoptosis, and cell
growth. Although there is no proof that ANXA1 is a disease-causing gene, it is clear that altering its expression or
the localization of the protein it encodes can contribute to
the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases and cancer (11,
12). The induction of endogenous ANXA1 is part of the mechanism of action of glucocorticoids such as dexamethasone
(13, 14). Dexamethasone-induced apoptosis and anti-inflammatory responses are associated with inhibition of NF-κB.
Here, we show that ANXA1 is required for the inhibition of
NF-κB activity by anti-inflammatory drugs, propose a novel
mechanism of NF-κB inhibition, and show that an ANXA1based peptide suppresses the growth of colon cancer xenografts in nude mice.

Mice. Min and C57BL/6J mice (The Jackson Laboratory)
were treated with 100 mg/kg NO-ASA or 10 mg/kg/d dexamethasone i.p. once a day for 7 d, and then were euthanized;
small intestinal mucosa was harvested by scraping. We evaluated the induction of ANXA1 and the interaction between
ANXA1 and NF-κB p65 in mucosal whole-cell lysates. We determined NF-κB activity in the nuclear fraction. We established xenografts in 6-wk-old female BALB/c nude mice
(The Jackson Laboratory) by s.c. injecting 2 × 106 SW480 cells
in 100 μL of PBS. Tumor volume (V) was determined using
the formula V = L × W(L + W/2) × 0.56 (L, length; W, width;
ref. 16).
Statistical analyses. We used the two-tailed unpaired
Student t test. Differences were considered significant at
P < 0.05.

Results
NO-ASA and glucocorticoids induce ANXA1 in human
cancer cells. Initially, we assessed the effect of NO-ASA, conventional ASA, other NSAIDs, and various glucocorticoids on
the expression of ANXA1 in human pancreatic and colon
cancer cell lines. As shown in Fig. 1, NO-ASA induced the expression ANXA1 in a concentration- and time-dependent
manner. In the cytoplasm, the induction of ANXA1 was rapid
and its levels were maximal at 3 hours, remaining relatively
stable for at least 8 hours. In the nucleus, ANXA1 became
detectable at 2 hours, peaked sharply at 3 hours, and declined rapidly thereafter, likely indicating a time-dependent
transport process. A similar effect was observed in HT-29 human colon cancer cells. Dexamethasone, the synthetic corticosteroid with the highest anti-inflammatory potency (17),
also induced ANXA1 in BxPC-3 cells, but only in the nuclei;
its cytoplasmic levels did not show any significant change.
The same effect was observed in HT-29 cells (data not
shown). We also evaluated phospho-aspirin (structurally similar to NO-ASA, bearing in the place of the NO-donating moiety diethyl phosphate), which has strong anticancer
properties (16, 18). Phospho-aspirin induced ANXA1, similar
to NO-ASA (data not shown). However, conventional ASA up
to 5 mmol/L, cortisone up to 100 μmol/L, and six additional
conventional NSAIDs, each at 1 mmol/L for 6 hours, failed to
induce the expression of ANXA1 in BxPC-3 cells (Supplementary Fig. S1).
We investigated the effect on ANXA1 expression of seven
glucocorticoids, representing a broad range of anti-inflammatory potencies (17). They included (anti-inflammatory potency in parentheses) cortisol (1), cortisone (0.8), prednisone
(4), triamcinolone (5), fludrocortisone (10), betamethasone
(25), and dexamethasone (25). BxPC-3 cells were treated for

Annexin A1 Inhibits NF-κB

Figure 1. NO-ASA and
glucocorticoids induce ANXA1 in
human cancer cells. The
expression of ANXA1 was
determined by immunoblotting in
the nuclei (n) and cytoplasm (c);
β-actin was the loading control.
NO-ASA induced the expression
of ANXA1 in BxPC-3 pancreatic
(A, top) and HT-29 colon cancer
cells (A, bottom). Dexamethasone
was studied in BxPC-3 cells (B).
The concentrations in the
time-response experiments were
30 μmol/L NO-ASA and 4 μmol/L
dexamethasone. The numbers in
italics below the immunoblots
represent the band intensity
compared with that of the
corresponding loading control.
C, BxPC-3 cells were treated for
6 h with glucocorticoids, each
at 4 μmol/L; ANXA1 was
evaluated by immunoblotting. The
anti-inflammatory potency of
these glucocorticoids, shown in
parentheses, correlates with the
levels of ANXA1, which they
induce. ANXA1 levels, determined
by densitometry, are expressed in
arbitrary units (AU). D, the effect of
these glucocorticoids on the
NF-κB activity of these cells was
determined in parallel by ELISA.
Columns, mean (n = 3); bars, SEM.
The numbers in the abscissa,
reflecting those in C, denote the
corresponding glucocorticoids.
The association between NF-κB
activity and ANXA1 levels as
determined in C and D is
statistically significant.

6 hours with these compounds, each at 4 μmol/L, applied
individually. The induction of ANXA1 was proportional to
their relative anti-inflammatory potency, with dexamethasone having the greatest effect (Fig. 1C and D). Indeed, the
anti-inflammatory potency of these glucocorticoids and the
corresponding cellular levels of ANXA1 were significantly
correlated (R2 = 0.91; P < 0.001).
ANXA1 is required for the inhibition of NF-κB by antiinflammatory agents. We investigated whether ANXA1
mediates the inhibition of NF-κB by NO-ASA and dexamethasone. BxPC-3 and HT-29 cells were treated with NO-ASA or
dexamethasone for 3 hours, and NF-κB activity was determined using an ELISA assay. Both NO-ASA and dexamethasone inhibited the activity of NF-κB in both cell lines (Fig. 2).

www.aacrjournals.org

As shown in Fig. 1, all of the glucocorticoids that we studied
inhibited NF-κB activity in a manner that paralleled their
anti-inflammatory potency. Of interest, NF-κB activity was
inversely correlated to the level of ANXA1 that was induced
by them (R2 = 0.93; P < 0.001), further suggesting that ANXA1
mediates the NF-κB inhibitory effect of these compounds.
To directly assess this possibility, we knocked down the
expression of ANXA1 in BxPC-3 cells using an ANXA1-specific
siRNA (Fig. 2C). NO-ASA at 20 μmol/L had only a marginal
effect on NF-κB activity (10% reduction); in control cells,
treated with vehicle or nonspecific siRNA, 20 μmol/L NOASA suppressed NF-κB activity by 40%. Dexamethasone
had a similar effect (data not shown). The siRNA against
ANXA1 enhanced NF-κB activity compared with controls

(nonspecific siRNA and not transfected cells), suggesting a
baseline inhibitory effect on NF-κB activity by ANXA1.
ANXA1 is required for the induction of apoptosis by
anti-inflammatory agents in human cancer cells. NO-ASA
inhibits the growth of human cancer cell lines, predominantly
through enhanced apoptosis (19). As Fig. 3A confirms, NO-ASA
inhibited the growth of HT-29 cells (IC50 = 18.8 μmol/L), inducing apoptosis vigorously (up to 4.5-fold over baseline). Similar results were obtained with BxPC-3 cells (IC50 = 9.8 μmol/L).
In both cell lines, NO-ASA inhibited the expression of Bcl-2,
a NF-κB–dependent antiapoptotic gene, and of the apoptosis-related proteins survivin, c-IAP-1, c-IAP-2, and TRAF-1
in BxPC-3 cells.

To assess the role of ANXA1 in the cell growth inhibitory
effect of these compounds, we knocked down its expression
by siRNA (Fig. 3B). Knocking down the expression of ANXA1
completely abrogated the apoptosis induced by either NOASA or dexamethasone. This finding suggests that ANXA1
is a key player in the proapoptotic effect of these anti-inflammatory agents. This notion is reinforced by the finding that
with overexpression of ANXA1 by transfecting ANXA1 cDNA
into BxPC-3 cells, cell growth was decreased by ∼60% compared with controls. A control plasmid showed no such effect
(Fig. 3C).
ANXA1 directly binds to the NF-κB p65 subunit. We
obtained several lines of evidence indicating that to inhibit

the activity of NF-κB, ANXA1 associates physically with the
NF-κB dimer. First, we used 96-well plates of an ELISA NF-κB
assay in which double-stranded oligomers containing the κB
recognition sequence (5′-CATCGGAAATTTCCGGAAATTTCCGGAAATTTCCGGC-3′ and its complementary
strand) were immobilized on the walls of the reaction wells.
Nuclear extracts from BxPC-3 cells treated for 3 hours with
or without 20 μmol/L NO-ASA were reacted with these κB
oligomers. NF-κB dimers bound to the κB oligomers were
recognized by anti-p65 or anti-p50 antibodies through a color

reaction dependent on a secondary antibody. When, instead
of the anti-p65 or anti-p50 antibodies, we used an antiANXA1 mAb that did not cross-react with either p50 or
p65, we obtained a positive reaction (recognition of the protein bound to the κB oligomers); a nonspecific isotypic antibody gave a negative result (Fig. 4A). These findings suggest
either that ANXA1 is associated with the NF-κB dimer or that
it cross-binds to the κB oligomers.
To clarify this finding, we immunoprecipitated the nuclear
protein fraction of BxPC-3 cells treated with NO-ASA as above

Figure 3. ANXA1 mediates the apoptosis and cell death induced by anti-inflammatory agents. A, NO-ASA inhibited the growth of HT-29 human colon
cells (top). The chemical structure of NO-ASA is shown. NO-ASA enhanced HT-29 cell apoptosis in a concentration-dependent manner (middle). This effect

observation period; BxPC-3 cells were treated with 30 μmol/L NO-ASA. *, P < 0.04; **, P < 0.001, compared with control. B, the expression of ANXA1 was

expression status of ANXA1 was evaluated by immunoblotting (middle), confirming its overexpression by the ANXA1 cDNA construct. Cell death was
induced only in the cells overexpressing ANXA1, as shown in photomicrograph #3 at the top (the numbers in each image correspond to that inside each
column of the graph). Cell growth was determined by MTT assay, as described in Materials and Methods. Columns, mean (n = 3); bars, SD. *, P < 0.01.

using an anti-p65 mAb. Immunoblotting with the anti-ANXA1
mAb revealed the presence of markedly increased amounts of
ANXA1 in the NO-ASA–treated cells compared with controls.
Immunoprecipitation with an isotypic nonspecific mAb failed
to precipitate ANXA1 (Fig. 4B). HT-29 cells gave similar results (Fig. 4C). Finally, we performed an EMSA using nuclear
extracts from BxPC-3 cells treated with NO-ASA (Fig. 4D). As
expected (3), NO-ASA markedly suppressed the binding of NFκB to the κB probe. When, however, the nuclear extract from
NO-ASA–treated cells was reacted with an anti-ANXA1 mAb
during the nuclear protein extract-κB probe binding step, the
binding of NF-κB to the κB oligomer was restored, as
evidenced by a strong NF-κB band in the EMSA. A nonspecific
control IgG antibody had no such effect. This finding suggests
that ANXA1 is associated with the NF-κB dimer and prevents
its binding to the κB binding site. The induction of ANXA1 by
NO-ASA and its physical association with NF-κB were also
shown in HT-29 human colon cancer cells (data not shown).
Confocal microscopy studies indicated that ANXA1 physically associated with the NF-κB p65 subunit. In BxPC-3 cells,
we examined whether p65 and ANXA1 colocalized following
treatment with NO-ASA. In untreated cells, the two proteins
colocalized minimally, if at all (Fig. 5A). In response to a 2-hour
treatment with NO-ASA, there was a marked concentrationdependent colocalization of p65 and ANXA1. When cells were
treated with 20 μmol/L NO-ASA, colocalization was more pronounced in the nuclei (Fig. 5A), consistent with the enhanced
nuclear ANXA1 levels detected by immunoblotting (Fig. 1).
Dexamethasone generated similar results (Supplementary
Fig. S2). We were unable to document binding of ANXA1 to
p50, the other subunit of the NF-κB dimer in these cells.
Whether such an interaction occurs below the detection
power of our methods remains unclear.
In Min mice, NO-ASA and dexamethasone induce
ANXA1, which binds to the p65 subunit of NF-κB and inhibits its activation. To assess whether the changes in cancer
cell lines occur in vivo, we evaluated the effect of NO-ASA and
dexamethasone on NF-κB activity in the intestinal mucosa of
Min mice and the corresponding wild-type mice C57BL/6J.
Heterozygous Min mutants spontaneously develop tumors
in the intestine and represent a useful model of intestinal
carcinogenesis (20). As previously reported, NO-ASA inhibits
intestinal carcinogenesis in Min mice (21). Mice were treated
with 100 mg/kg NO-ASA or 10 mg/kg dexamethasone i.p.
once a day for 1 week and then were euthanized. Protein
lysates from the scraped intestinal mucosa were evaluated
for NF-κB activity.
As shown in Fig. 5B, NO-ASA and dexamethasone suppressed NF-κB activity in Min mice by 64.3% and 60.8%, respectively (P < 0.01). There was a modest (35.6% and 38.8%)
but significant (P < 0.05) reduction of NF-κB activity in
wild-type mice in response to these agents. To confirm
the physical association between ANXA1 and p65, we used
an anti-p65 mAb to precipitate protein lysates from the
intestinal mucosa. Immunoblotting established the presence
of ANXA1 in the precipitates (Fig. 5C). In addition, confocal
microscopy showed colocalization of ANXA1 and p65 in
mucosal cells dispersed from intestinal mucosal scrapings,

ANXA1-derived peptides: inhibition of NF-κB activity
and suppression of xenograft tumor growth. The
NH 2 -terminal sequence of ANXA1 can reproduce the
anti-inflammatory actions of the full-length protein (22).
Therefore, we treated BxPC-3 cells for 3 hours with two
commercially available NH2-terminal fragments of ANXA1,
Ac2-26 or Ac2-12, at 30 μmol/L each. They decreased NF-κB
activity by 25% and 30%, respectively (P < 0.05 for both;

data not shown). Similar results were obtained in SW480 cells
(data not shown). Consequently, we synthesized a series of
peptides based on the NH2-terminal sequence of the ANXA1
protein. As shown in Fig. 6, three of six such peptides inhibited
NF-κB activity in SW480 cells; the most potent was the tripeptide Ac-Gln-Ala-Trp (Ac = acetyl), designated QW-3. Their
NF-κB inhibitory activity was accompanied by enhanced
apoptosis. For example, treatment of SW480 cells with
30 μmol/L QW-3 for 3 hours decreased NF-κB activity by
40% and enhanced apoptosis 1.7-fold over untreated controls

Finally, we investigated the effect of QW-3 on the growth of
subcutaneous xenografts of SW480 human colon cancer cells
in nude mice. Starting when the average tumor volume was
about 750 mm3, nude mice (n = 18) were treated with 80 μg of
QW-3 i.p. once a day for 12 days. Compared with the control
group (n = 18; vehicle alone), QW-3 suppressed tumor growth,
its effect being statistically significant on day 8 (P < 0.05) and
day 12 (P < 0.01), reducing tumor volume by 48.0% and 58.1%,
respectively (Fig. 6C). The mice tolerated this treatment well
without any evidence of distress or toxicity, including no
change in their body weight compared with controls.

Discussion
Our study provides a novel mechanism for the regulation
of NF-κB. This mechanism integrates three seemingly disparate components: (a) NF-κB, the master regulator of multiple
cellular phenomena, some of which are associated with inflammation and cancer; (b) ANXA1, a member of a superfamily whose members regulate several functions in the cell; and
(c) anti-inflammatory drugs, including glucocorticoids and
the newer modified NSAIDs; glucocorticoids are used clinically as strong anti-inflammatory compounds, and modified
NSAIDs hold promise as chemopreventive agents.
The mechanism that our results document is the following: Most glucocorticoids and modified NSAIDs induce the
expression of ANXA1, which associates physically with NFκB and suppresses its transcriptional activity by rendering
the NF-κB dimer incapable of binding to DNA. These steps

have been clearly documented. The induction of ANXA1 is
selective, occurring only in response to glucocorticoids and
modified NSAIDs such as NO-ASA and phospho-aspirin,
but not in response to conventional NSAIDs. A second feature of this induction is that it is proportional to the pharmacologic potency of the inducing agent. This was clearly
established in the case of glucocorticoids, the class of ANXA1
inducers for which such analysis was possible (their antiinflammatory potency and ANXA1 induction were almost
perfectly correlated). This may also be true of NSAIDs, if
we include the two modified aspirins, which are much more
potent than conventional aspirin (16, 18, 19).
The induction of ANXA1 is accompanied by its physical
association with NF-κB, in particular with its p65 subunit.
The binding of ANXA1 to NF-κB has been documented amply
in vitro (cell protein extracts), in cultured cells, and in intestinal epithelial cells of mice. It is noteworthy that our data
indicate that ANXA1 binds only to the p65 subunit of NF-κB;
we were unable to document an interaction with the p50 subunit. Ongoing studies are attempting to address the reason
for such preferential interaction and to identify the region
critical for the physical association of the two molecules.
It is unclear where in the cell the association of ANXA1
and NF-κB occurs. Based mainly on our confocal microscopy
studies, it seems that this binding occurs in the cytoplasm
and that the complex translocates to the nucleus; such translocation, however, seems quite limited in dexamethasonetreated cells. Thus, it is conceivable that the cellular distribution
of the ANXA1/NF-κB complex may differ depending on
the agent inducing it.
The binding of ANXA1 to NF-κB inhibits the activation of
NF-κB. It is, however, unclear how the binding of ANXA1 to

Annexin A1 Inhibits NF-κB

p65 inhibits the activation of NF-κB. It is conceivable that the
presence of ANXA1 in the NF-κB dimer prevents the binding
of NF-κB to its target DNA sequence either through steric
hindrance or through a conformational change in p65 that
alters its DNA binding site. Whatever the mechanism, this
inhibition, although not complete under our experimental
conditions, is nevertheless functionally important. This
was documented by in vitro and in vivo cellular changes.
For example, the induction of ANXA1 and its interaction with
NF-κB in cultured cells derived from two human cancers (colon
and pancreatic) enhanced apoptotic cell death; disruption of
any of these steps abrogated cell death and rescued cell
growth. Furthermore, the inhibition of NF-κB activation by
ANXA1 changed several NF-κB–dependent signaling molecules (survivin, Bcl-2, etc.), confirming the involvement of
the expected pathway (23).
Our findings extend previous observations that the NH2terminal portion of ANXA1 mediates some of its known biological effects. Indeed, not only did we show that a 12- and a
22-amino-acid peptide inhibited NF-κB activation but we
were also able to design even shorter effective peptides, with
a tripeptide (QW-3) being the most potent. Several tripeptides are known to be very effective biologically, with perhaps
the best known examples being glutathione and the thyrotropin-releasing hormone. QW-3 inhibited the activation of
NF-κB in cultured cells (as well as their growth).
The novel interaction between ANXA1 and NF-κB may
help explain several prior observations on the effect of glucocorticoids and ANXA1-derived peptides in aspects of inflammation and related phenomena. For example, it is known
that NF-κB activity is persistently increased during neutrophil-mediated inflammatory disorders (24). On the other
hand, ANXA1, peptides based on its NH2-terminal sequence,
and glucocorticoids (but not conventional NSAIDs) inhibit
various neutrophil-mediated phenomena such as inflammation and ischemia reperfusion injury (25); also, glucocorticoids suppress NF-κB in neutrophils (26). It is conceivable
that the sequence anti-inflammatory agent→induction of ANXA1→inhibition of NF-κB may explain these effects (and the
lack of effect by conventional NSAIDs).
Besides its inhibitory effect on cell growth, QW-3 inhibited
the growth of colon cancer cells grown as xenografts, achieving, in effect, cytostasis (xenograft volume remained stable
during the period of observation). Although the overall significance of this observation for cancer control is at present unclear, it nonetheless suggests that the link between ANXA1,

NF-κB, and tumor growth is worth exploring further. Indeed,
annexins have long been considered significant players in
tumor development and progression (12). Our findings suggest the potential for drug development not only for cancer
but also for the control of inflammation-related diseases.
ANXA1-derived peptides or small molecules with similar activities may bypass the considerable side effects of conventional anti-inflammatory agents, including glucocorticoids,
or may have significant anticancer properties.
Whereas ANXA1 mediates some of the effects of potent
glucocorticoids and of the potent modified NSAIDs, it is uncertain whether its inhibitory action on NF-κB is the main
(or only) mediator of their pharmacologic effects. Our data,
limited as they are to cell culture studies, establish a very
strong association between the anti-inflammatory potency
of glucocorticoids, induction of ANXA1, and NF-κB inhibition. It is thus tempting to speculate that the ability of a compound to induce ANXA1 may determine its anti-inflammatory
potency. If this is proved to be the case, one may predict that
defects in ANXA1 may be responsible for some cases of steroid resistance, a well-described and clinically significant
phenomenon (27).
In conclusion, our findings reveal that ANXA1 is an endogenous inhibitor of NF-κB that can be induced in human cancer
cells and mice by potent anti-inflammatory glucocorticoids
and modified NSAIDs. ANXA1 inhibits the activation of NF-κB
by binding to its p65 subunit. Oligopeptides based on the NH2terminal sequence of ANXA1 have similar effects, and one of
them inhibits strongly the growth of tumor xenografts. This
novel molecular mechanism for the action of anti-inflammatory
agents suggests an area for mechanism-driven drug development.
