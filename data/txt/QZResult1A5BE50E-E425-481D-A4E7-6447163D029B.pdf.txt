Target Microtubules and Kinesin-5

Abstract
To improve cancer chemotherapy, we need to understand the
mechanisms that determine drug sensitivity in cancer and
normal cells. Here, we investigate this question across a panel
of 11 cell lines at a phenotypic and molecular level for three
antimitotic drugs: paclitaxel, nocodazole, and an inhibitor of
kinesin-5 (also known as KSP, Eg5, Kif11). Using automated
microscopy with markers for mitosis and apoptosis (high
content screening), we find that the mitotic arrest response
shows relatively little variation between cell types, whereas the
tendency to undergo apoptosis shows large variation. We
found no correlation between levels of mitotic arrest and
apoptosis. Apoptosis depended on entry into mitosis and
occurred both from within mitosis and after exit. Response to
the three drugs strongly correlated, although paclitaxel
caused more apoptosis in some cell lines at similar levels of
mitotic arrest. Molecular investigations showed that sensitivity to apoptosis correlated with loss of an antiapoptotic
protein, XIAP, during the drug response, but not its
preresponse levels, and to some extent also correlated with
activation of the p38 and c-Jun NH2 kinase pathways. We
conclude that variation in sensitivity to antimitotic drugs in
drug-naive cell lines is governed more by differences in
apoptotic signaling than by differences in mitotic spindle or
spindle assembly checkpoint proteins and that antimitotics
with different mechanisms trigger very similar, but not
identical, responses. [Cancer Res 2008;68(9):3269–76]

Introduction
Genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity of cancer presents a large
challenge to effective chemotherapy. Drug responses vary greatly,
not only between disease types, but also between individual
patients with the same disease. For certain inhibitors of kinase
oncogenes, variation in drug sensitivity can be caused by mutations
in the drug binding site (1), but for most anticancer drugs, the
mechanistic basis of drug sensitivity is poorly understood. This
question has been investigated in several ways, including
sequencing target protein genes, selection of drug-resistant cell
lines, and molecular profiling. However, for most commonly used
anticancer drugs, including antimitotics, this problem is far from
solved (2).
Established antimitotic drugs are mostly from the taxane and
Vinca alkaloid classes, which bind to microtubules and inhibit their

polymerization dynamics (3). Here, we use two antimicrotubule
drugs: paclitaxel, which stabilizes microtubules and is used
clinically, and nocodazole, which destabilizes microtubules and is
only used as a laboratory tool. Experimental antimitotics include
novel microtubule inhibitors, such as the epothilones and
dolistatins (4), as well as compounds that inhibit nonmicrotubule
proteins in the mitotic spindle. The latter class include inhibitors of
the motor protein kinesin-5 (K5I; also known as KSP, Eg5, and
Kif11) and inhibitors of three mitotic kinases (Aurora-A, Aurora-B,
and Plk-1; ref. 5). Here, we use a K5I, EMD534085, that is similar
in mechanism, but not structure, to recently described compounds
(6, 7). Like other K5Is, it prevents bipolar spindle assembly and
causes arrest in mitosis with monopolar spindles. All the
antimitotics mentioned above activate the spindle assembly
checkpoint (except Aurora-B inhibitors, which block checkpoint
activation). Checkpoint activation sequesters Cdc20, inhibiting
cyclin-B proteolysis and the metaphase-to-anaphase transition (8).
Drug-treated cells eventually slip out of mitotic arrest without
assembling a normal spindle (9). This abnormal mitotic exit pathway involves ubiquitination of Cdc20 (10) and gradual proteolysis
of cyclin B (11). After exit without cytokinesis, the now tetraploid
cells enter an abnormal G1 phase of the cell cycle and may arrest or
proliferate, depending in part on their p53 status (12).
Depending on the cell type and drug, cells treated with
antimitotics may also undergo programmed cell death, either
directly from the abnormal mitosis or after exit (9, 13). This death
is central to both the therapeutic and toxic effects of antimitotics,
but its mechanism is poorly understood. Most studies reported that
cell death triggered by antimitotics was classic apoptosis, with
caspase activation and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1)
cleavage (6, 14–16). However, a few studies reported death by
poorly understood caspase-independent mechanisms (17, 18).
Inactivation of antiapoptotic proteins Bcl2 and Bcl-xL by
phosphorylation was implicated in death triggered by paclitaxel
(19, 20), as were several kinases, including c-Jun NH2 terminal
kinase (JNK), extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), p38
mitogen activated protein (MAP) kinase, AKT, and protein kinase
A (21–26). There are contradictory reports regarding the role of
the spindle assembly checkpoint in mediating cell death triggered
by antimitotics. Most studies reported that checkpoint activation
was required for death triggered by paclitaxel or K5I (6, 27–29),
but some suggested death was checkpoint independent (30, 31).
Despite the high degree of evolutionary conservation of spindle
and checkpoint proteins, different cell types can respond very
differently to antimitotics, and the mechanistic basis of this
variation remains poorly understood. For example, variation in
clinical response to taxanes does not seem to correlate with
proliferation rate, drug pump expression, tubulin alterations, or
p53 status (2). Here, we investigate variation in antimitotic drug
responses in cell culture. This question has been extensively
investigated before for paclitaxel, but we departed from previous
studies in using information-rich readouts, including high content

maximal percentage of cells in mitotic arrest at saturating concentration of a given drug.

and then stained with 25 Ag/mL propidium iodide, 0.2 mg/mL Rnase A, and
0.1% Triton in PBS at 37jC for 20 min. Flow cytometric measurement of
cellular DNA content was conducted with a FACSCalibur cytometer (Becton
Dickinson). Percentages of cells in different cell cycle stages were estimated
by the observed distribution of DNA content, i.e., sub-G1 (DNA < 2N),
G0-G1 (DNA = 2N), S (2N < DNA < 4N), G2-M (DNA = 4N), and polyploid
(DNA > 4N). EC50 and E max values were obtained from standard sigmoidal
fits using the data analysis software Origin (OriginLab Corporation).
Phenotypic profiling by automated microscopy. Cells were plated in
384-well imaging plates (Corning) at an initial density of 3,500 per well.
Drugs were added 24 h later. Cells were fixed and permeablized at different
time points using 3.7% formaldehyde, 100 mmol/L PIPES, 10 mmol/L EGTA,
1 mmol/L MgCl2, 0.2% Triton X-100 (pH 6.8). Before fixation, plates were
spun at 1,500 rpm for 5 min to minimize loss of floating cells. Then cells
were stained with antibody to phosphorylated histone 3 and cleaved
caspase-8 (or MPM2 and cleaved PARP1) in 2% w/v bovine serum albumin,
TBS-Tx [0.15 mol/L NaCl, 20 mmol/L Tris-Cl (pH 7.4), 0.1% Triton-X-100]
followed by secondary antibodies conjugated with AlexaFluor 488 and
AlexaFluor 594. DNA was stained with 1 Ag/mL Hoechst 33258. Plates were
imaged with an ImageXpress automated microscope (Molecular Devices)
using a 20 objective lens.
Image analysis. Cells (100–200 per well) were quantified, and eight
replicate wells were averaged for each measurement. Using Metamorph
software (Molecular Devices), nuclei were segmented in the Hoechst
channel, and the fraction of these that were positive for PhosH3 or cleaved
PARP1 was determined. All results from the automated analysis were
corrected manually so as to minimize the error in cell counting to F10%.
Time-lapse phase-contrast microscopy. Cells were plated in 24-well
glass-bottomed plates (MatTek) in CO2-independent medium (Invitrogen),
supplemented with 10% FCS, 100 units/mL penicillin, and 100 AL
streptomycin and observed with an inverted microscope using a
20 objective (numerical aperture, 0.95; Nikon) enclosed in a humidified

motorized stage.
Western blot analysis. Drug-treated cells grown in six-well plates were
lysed at 12 time points after drug addition using LDS sample buffer
(NuPAGE, Invitrogen). Proteins were resolved on 10% or 12% Tris-glycine
gels and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. Blots were probed with
commercial primary antibodies and chemiluminescent detection using
enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham), ECL-plus (Amersham), or
SuperSignal Femto (Pierce), depending on the strength of the signal.
Antibodies used were as follows: phosphorylated histone H3 and phosphorylated histone H2A.X purchased from Upstate; PARP1, caspase-8,
caspase-9, XIAP, p38, Bid, phosphorylated p38, JNK, phosphorylated JNK,
phosphorylated Akt (Thr308), phosphorylated Akt (Ser437), phosphorylated
Chk1, phosphorylated Chk2, and phosphorylated PERK (Thr980) from Cell
Signaling; Bax, Bcl-xl, Akt, p53, Bip (GRP78), and CHOP (GADD 153) from
Santa Cruz; Bcl2 from Biosource. Anti–a-tubulin (Sigma) was used as a
loading control.

Results
Dose-response of human cell lines treated with antimitotic
drugs. Eleven human cell lines were chosen on the basis of
approximately similar doubling times (f18–26 hours) and possible
variation in antimitotic response from the National Cancer
Institute–Developmental Therapeutics Program database.2 They
were derived from cancers of the lung (A549, H460), colon
(HCT116, HT29), breast (MCF7, MDAMB435S), ovary (OVCAR5),
cervix (HeLa), prostate (PC3), and bone (U2OS). RPE, a telomerase
immortalized line derived from retinal pigment epithelium, was
included as a noncancer control. Preliminary time-lapse imaging
and fixed time point immunofluorescence revealed that mitotic
arrest peaked at f24 hours and cell death at f48 hours, after drug
addition for the majority of cell lines.
To obtain preliminary data on drug sensitivity, we performed
dose titrations using flow cytometry analysis of DNA content to
measure mitotic arrest at 24 hours (Fig. 1A and Supplementary
Fig. S1). EC50 (half maximal effective concentration) and E max

(saturating mitotic response) values are reported in Table 1.
Correlations between drugs are shown in Table 2 and discussed
below. Paclitaxel exhibited a noticeably more variable EC50 (f22fold range) than the other two drugs (f6-fold range). We used
these data to determine the lowest drug concentration that gave
a saturating response (E max) for the least sensitive cell line and
conducted all following experiments at that single concentration
(paclitaxel 150 nmol/L; nocodazole 500 nmol/L; K5I 500 nmol/L).
Apoptosis varies more than mitotic arrest. To quantify
mitotic arrest and cell death at the single cell level, we used
automated microscopy assay with molecular markers, sometimes
called high content screening (32, 33). Cells were cultured in 384well plates, treated with drugs at the saturating concentration, and
fixed at appropriate time points. They were then stained with a
fluorescent DNA probe to measure cell number, antibody to
phosphorylated histone 3 to measure mitosis, and antibody to
cleaved PARP1 to measure apoptosis. Mitotic index at 24 hours and
apoptotic index at 48 hours were calculated by dividing the number
of cells positive for that marker by the total number of cells in
each microscopy field. Very similar results were obtained with
different markers for mitosis (MPM2 antibody that recognizes
phosphorylated Ser/Thr-Pro epitopes) or apoptosis (antibody to
cleaved caspase-8) (data not shown). Cell survival ratio was
calculated by measuring total cells remaining per field at 72 hours
and divided by the number of cells at time 0 (before drug addition).
Figure 1B shows the paclitaxel response across the 11 cell lines
as an example. Cell lines are ordered on the x axis according to
their sensitivity to paclitaxel as determined by the 72-hour cell
survival ratio. For ease of comparison, we retain this order for all
the figures. Two points are immediately clear: the apoptotic index
at 48 hours varies widely between the cell lines (>20-fold range),
and this parameter correlates well with cell survival ratio at 72
hours. The mitotic index at 24 hours, in contrast, varies less (f3fold range) and correlates poorly with cell survival.
Figure 1C and D reports mitotic arrest and apoptotic indices for
all the drugs and cell lines, and Table 3 reports correlations between
these responses and cell survival ratio. These data generalize the
result stated for paclitaxel above: for each of the drugs, the
apoptotic index was highly variable across the cell panel (ranges
>20-fold) and correlated well with the cell survival ratio (coefficients
between 0.77 and 0.86). For each of the drugs, the mitotic index
was much less variable (ranges <4-fold), and it correlated poorly
with cell survival (coefficients between 0.1 and 0.31).
Responses to the different antimitotics correlate. The three
drugs act in different ways, but all trigger the same spindle
assembly checkpoint, and thus, we might expect correlated
responses across the cell line panel. Such correlation is evident
from inspection of Fig. 1C and D, wherein the three colored bars
for each cell line are similar in height. We quantified this using
between-drug correlation coefficients for both the bulk mitotic
arrest assay, where we measured both EC50 and E max values
(Table 2), and the microscopy data, which are only E max values

(Table 3). Between-drug comparison of E max values showed strong
correlation in both assays (coefficients, 0.72–0.86). In contrast,
between-drug comparisons of EC50 values in the bulk assay gave
weaker correlations ( 0.21 to 0.42). E max values are, in principle,
insensitive to expression levels of drug efflux pumps and to other
factors that cause variation in drug sensitivity in a manner that
depends on the chemical structure of a drug rather than its
biological activity, whereas EC50 values are sensitive to these
factors. This may explain why drug sensitivity measured by E max
values give stronger between-drug correlations for a set of drugs
that differ greatly in structure but little in activity.
Paclitaxel is more toxic than the other antimitotics.
Although responses to the three antimitotics correlated strongly
across the cell lines for all measured E max variables, we did notice
one interesting difference. Paclitaxel was consistently more effective
in causing apoptosis than the other two drugs. This effect is evident
from the black bars (paclitaxel) in Fig. 1D being taller than the
colored bars (nocodazole and K5I). The effect was almost a
2-fold increase in apoptotic index for paclitaxel compared with the
next most toxic drug for H460 and HCT116. This consistently higher
E max for paclitaxel is not evident in the mitotic arrest response,
indicating that it is not an artifact of using subsaturating concentrations of the other drugs. We also noticed a stronger apoptotic
response to paclitaxel than other drugs in time lapse and Western
blot assays (see below). Thus, the ability of the drugs to promote
apoptosis, when normalized to approximately equal mitotic index,
is not equal; paclitaxel is significantly more toxic. This observation
may have important implications for how apoptosis is triggered.
Sensitivity to an alternative apoptotic trigger. To test if
sensitivity to apoptosis in our cell panel was unique to antimitotics,
we measured the apoptotic response to staurosporine, a broad
spectrum kinase inhibitor that is often used to trigger apoptosis,
although its precise mechanism is unknown. We used 1 Amol/L
staurosporine and a 12-hour time point, as preliminary investigation of concentrations and times (not shown) showed that our
qualitative conclusion is not sensitive to changing these variables.
Figure 2A shows the apoptotic index for staurosporine, with the
cell lines ordered by sensitivity to paclitaxel as in Fig. 1. A general
correlation in sensitivity is evident by the bars mostly decreasing
from left to right. This is quantified with correlation coefficients in
Table 3. Sensitivity to staurosporine, measured by apoptotic index
at 12 hours, correlated fairly well with 72-hour cell survival ratio
for the three antimitotic drugs (coefficients, 0.62 to 0.7). This
correlation was less good than it was for the antimitotics with each
other, as evident from both the coefficients in Table 2, and the
outlier status of U2OS in Fig. 2A. We also measured apoptosis
triggered by Brefeldin-A, which activates the ER stress pathway,
and found that sensitivity across our panel roughly correlated with
staurosporine and the antimitotics (data not shown). We tried to
correlate with sensitivity to a DNA-damaging reagent, neocarzinostatin, but were unable to obtain fast enough killing in most of
our cell lines for work in 384-well plates. We conclude that

Cell Type Variation in Antimitotic Drug Responses

antimitotics are not unique and sensitivity to different apoptotic
triggers broadly correlates in our panel of cell lines.
Antimitotics induce death that depends on both caspases
and mitosis. Most of the cell death in our panel occurred directly
from mitosis (see below), and it has been controversial whether
this type of death is caspase-dependent (9). To test this, we used
the broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor zVAD-FMK. We focused
initially on one drug-sensitive line, HeLa. As expected, zVAD-FMK
almost completely blocked PARP cleavage (Fig. 2B, left). It also
largely rescued the 72-hour cell survival (Fig. 2B, right). The
observed survival ratios of 0.6 to 0.9 indicate that the majority of
cells are not dying in antimitotic + zVAD-FMK, whereas almost all
HeLa cells die in antimitotic alone (survival ratio, <0.05). We then
repeated the zVAD-FMK test on other cell lines that showed
appreciable levels of apoptosis. In each case zVAD-FMK strongly
boosted the cell survival ratios to near 1 (data not shown). We
concluded that most of the cell death in our assays was due to
classic apoptosis. We note three important caveats to this
conclusion: zVAD-FMK is not completely specific for caspases
and may inhibit other proteases potentially involved in cell death;
in a nonadherent cell line not included in this panel, we found
that death in mitosis caused by antimitotics was largely insensitive
to zVAD-FMK and thus presumably not caspase mediated;3 and
finally, the cells in our panel rescued from death using zVAD-FMK
were far from normal. Their nuclei often displayed highly abnormal
morphologies, and the apparent size of their cytoplasm was
variable. We suspect these rescued cells would, in many cases, die
or senesce if observed for longer. Thus, it is likely that other death
and senescence pathways also play a role in the response to
antimitotics in our panel, as noted by others (9, 17, 18).
Most death triggered by antimitotics depends on passage into or
through mitosis (9), but some cell lines may be sensitive at other cell
cycle stages, especially to agents that perturb interphase microtubules. To test directly if entry into mitosis is required for death, we
pretreated cells for 12 hours with aphidicolin, an inhibitor of DNA
polymerase, which arrests cells in S phase. As shown in Fig. 2C,
death triggered by paclitaxel (chosen as the most toxic of the
antimitotics) was mostly inhibited when cells were prearrested in S
phase. Seventy-two–hour survival ratios of 0.7 to 0.8 were observed
after pretreatment with aphidicolin compared with 0.1 to 0.2
without pretreatment. Similar protection from death was observed
when cells were pretreated with purvalanol, a potent inhibitor of
cdk1 and cdk2, which arrests cells at both G1-S and G2-M
transitions, and thus blocks entry into mitosis by alternative
mechanisms (data not shown). Therefore, in our cell panel,
paclitaxel-induced death largely requires entry into mitosis.
Cell cycle timing of death induced by antimitotics. To test if
cell cycle timing of death correlated with drug sensitivity, we used
time-lapse phase-contrast microscopy in unsynchronized populations. Three relevant events were easily scored: entry to mitosis,
exit from mitosis, and cell death (Supplementary Fig. S2). Essentially, all the cell deaths we observed occurred either directly from
mitosis or after exit without cleavage. At the drug concentrations
used, essentially no cells completed normal cytokinesis. All the cell
lines exhibited considerable cell-to-cell variation in duration of
mitotic arrest and time from onset of mitosis to death (or exit to
death), whose precise kinetics we will report elsewhere. Here, we

focus on the question of whether death occurred directly from
mitosis or after exit (Supplementary Table S1). We observed excellent correlation between sensitivity to apoptosis in the time lapse
and fixed cell experiments, confirming that the different observation conditions did not greatly perturb cell responses, and we again
noted higher toxicity of paclitaxel compared with the other drugs.
The fraction of cells dying directly from mitosis versus after exit
was different for each cell line and drug, although it tended to
correlate between drugs. In the more death-sensitive cell lines, the
majority of cells died in mitosis by a ratio that varied from f30:1
(HeLa) to f1.6:1 (H460). In U2OS cells, the majority of cells died
after exit. For the cell lines that were highly resistant to death, such
as MCF7 and PC3, most cells exited after the prolonged mitotic
arrest and then remained in an abnormal G1-like state for extended
period of time. Thus, the time-lapse data define three broad and
overlapping phenotypes: death-sensitive with execution mainly in
mitosis, death sensitive with execution mainly after exit, and death
insensitive.
Profiling molecular events in apoptotic signaling. To
characterize drug responses at a molecular level, we performed
immunoblotting for a panel of proteins, and/or their posttransla-

tional modification states, which were previously implicated in
apoptotic signaling in antimitotic response, or more generally in
apoptosis regulation, including proteins involved in the DNA
damage and ER stress responses (see the complete list in Materials
and Methods). For this extensive analysis, we chose the two
clinically relevant drugs (paclitaxel and K5I) and six cell lines
representative of different degree of death sensitivity and cell cycle
timing of death (HeLa, HCT116, U2OS, A549, RPE, and PC3, listed
in descending order of sensitivity). We performed Western blots at
12 time points after drug addition to unsynchronized cells and ran
gels with the different time points for one cell line side by side
(e.g., Fig. 3A), as well as different cell lines for one time point (e.g.,
Fig. 3B) to allow quantitative comparisons. Exact timing and extent
of changes varied in replicate experiments, but qualitative conclusions were highly reproducible.
Figure 3A (HeLa/paclitaxel) is representative of the antimitotic response in a death-sensitive cell line. Results were very
similar in HCT116 and with K5I. Mitotic arrest, measured using
phosphorylated H3, peaks at f24 hours. Apoptosis, measured by
cleavage of PARP1 (and also cleavage of caspase-8 and caspase-9;
see Supplementary Figs. S3–7), starts at f24 hours and peaks later,

Cell Type Variation in Antimitotic Drug Responses

past 48 hours in this experiment. In general, phosphorylated
H3 levels and cleaved PARP1 levels measured by Western blot
correlated well with the automated microscopy measurements
in Fig. 1 for all cell lines and drugs. Cleavage of caspase-8 and
caspase-9 correlated with cleavage of PARP1 for all cell lines and
drugs, consistent with a common downstream apoptotic program
in all sensitive cell lines.
The DNA damage marker phosphorylated H2AX (34) was
strongly induced late in the response in all lines except the highly
resistant PC3, and even there, it was induced to some extent.
Paclitaxel was markedly more effective than K5I in triggering this
response in partially death-insensitive lines (compare 32–72 hour
lanes for A549 and RPE between Fig. 3B and C). This may be
another indication of the greater toxicity of paclitaxel than K5I.
We do not know what triggers the phosphorylated H2AX signal
and have not proved that it reports on DNA damage in this context.
We observed strong phosphorylated H2AX signals in some cases
where we detected little or no PARP1 cleavage (e.g., RPE/paclitaxel
and A549/K5I). Another possible DNA damage signal, up-regulation
of p53, was observed in p53-positive cell lines,4 correlating with
increase in phosphorylated H2AX. However, phosphorylation of
Chk1 and Chk 2 was not detected, even in cells with a very strong
phosphorylated H2AX response. We also probed for proteins
important for ER stress response, including Bip, phosphorylated
PERK, and CHOP, but no up-regulation was observed.
Induction of apoptosis in all cell lines coincided with
degradation of XIAP, an inhibitor of apoptosis (e.g., Fig. 3A). XIAP
levels remained constant in cells and drugs where PARP1 was not
cleaved (Supplementary Figs. S3–7). Similar correlation of XIAP
degradation with initiation of apoptosis has been noted in other
studies of response to chemotherapeutics (16). This suggests XIAP
acts as a buffer that would be titrated out before death occurs.
However, the level of XIAP in untreated cells did not correlate well
with sensitivity to death.
BH3 family proteins are key regulators of apoptosis, and their
expression levels have often been suggested to correlate with sensitivity (35). However, we were unable to find any consistent correlations between expression levels of the family members we tested
and sensitivity in our system. Bcl2 shifted to a slower migrating band
when cells were arrested in mitosis, presumably due to mitotic
phosphorylation, but this was equally true for all the lines. Levels of
the other BH3 family proteins we measured did not change until very
late in the response, and we saw no evidence of Bid cleavage.
We measured activity of the stress-sensitive kinases p38 and JNK
using phosphorylated antibodies. p38 showed some phosphorylation in untreated cells, and the levels tended to increase in the
apoptotic phase of the response, especially in more sensitive cells
(Fig. 3). Phosphorylated JNK levels also increased somewhat during
the apoptotic phase. These data are consistent with a role for
both p38 and JNK pathways in the response, but correlations with
sensitivity were not universal, suggesting they are only one factor
governing sensitivity.

Discussion
By profiling phenotypic responses to three antimitotic drugs
across a panel of cell lines, we found similar responses to the

different drugs, large variation in the tendency to undergo
apoptosis, and much smaller variation in the duration of mitotic
arrest. Thus, response of the mitotic spindle and checkpoint was
relatively constant between cell types and between drugs, whereas
response of the apoptotic machinery was much more variable
between cell types. Most death in our study occurred by caspasedependent apoptosis and required entry into mitosis, although
its execution could occur directly from mitosis or after exit. Before
discussing possible molecular bases of these observations, we will
touch on the question whether they are relevant to understanding
drug responses in tumors.
In a study of 11 breast cancer patients treated with paclitaxel
before surgery, Symmans et al. (36) measured mitotic arrest and
apoptosis by serial biopsies every 24 hours after the first round of
treatment. Both responses were quite variable between patients
and the two responses correlated poorly. The overall clinical
response, measured as the fraction of the original cancer remaining
after several rounds of drug treatment, correlated very well with
apoptosis and poorly with mitotic arrest. These observations agree
with our cell culture data in finding that mitotic arrest is largely
uncorrelated with apoptosis and tumor cell death and point to
apoptosis as the important variable for clinical response.
Considering animal model data, a pair of studies from the Milas
group (37, 38) is particularly relevant for comparison with our data.
A panel of 15 mouse tumor lines, grown by serial passage in mice,
were treated with a single dose of paclitaxel or docetaxel, and
animals were sacrificed at time intervals for quantitative histology.
Most of the cancer lines showed a peak of mitotic arrest, but only
some showed a subsequent peak of cell death. Again, the extent
of cell death and mitotic arrest correlated poorly, and tumor
shrinkage correlated with death much more than mitotic arrest.
These studies are entirely consistent with our cell culture data with
one important exception. Milas et al. reported that, after paclitaxel
administration, death mostly occurred after mitotic exit and was
scored as classic apoptosis by histology, whereas with docetaxel, it
mostly occurred directly from mitosis, with extensive release of cell
contents and leukocyte recruitment, and was scored as nonapoptotic death. We scored both death in mitosis and death after
exit as apoptotic, since they both involved PARP1 cleavage and
were blocked by caspase inhibitor. This discrepancy probably
reflects a difference between histologic and molecular definitions
of apoptosis. Overall, our results are concordant with the human
and mouse studies, suggesting that variation in sensitivity to
apoptosis is more important in determining tumor response to
antimitotics than variation in sensitivity to mitotic arrest.
What are likely molecular sources of variation in sensitivity to
apoptosis? Sensitivity in our panel correlated between antimitotics
and other stress-inducing reagents, suggesting variation in the
general stress sensing and apoptotic machinery dominates over
variation in mitosis specific pathways. The question becomes, what
makes cancer cells more or less sensitive to death triggered by
multiple stressors? There is a large literature on this topic, but no
clear and general answers have emerged. We were also unable to
obtain a clear-cut answer thus far, and our data failed to support
some previous suggestions (19–21). We did confirm that two stressactivated protein kinase pathways, JNK and p38, both previously
implicated in paclitaxel-induced cell death (22–24), were activated
by antimitotics, and to some extent, the degree of activation
correlated with drug sensitivity. The strongest correlation we found
was loss of XIAP (a negative regulator of apoptosis) during

treatment, which occurred only in death sensitive lines. Unfortunately, from the perspective of predicting responses in patients,
levels of this protein before treatment did not seem to correlate
with its disappearance during treatment.
Ours may be the first study to carefully compare phenotypic
responses of a nonmicrotubule antimitotic, K5I, to antimicrotubule
drugs, across a panel of cell lines. The three drugs in our study
seemed indistinguishable with respect to duration of mitotic arrest
at saturating drug concentration. Their ability to promote
apoptosis was also very similar, as were the molecular correlates
of death that we measured by Western blotting. The highly similar
cell responses to K5I and microtubule drugs indicate that
apoptosis is triggered mainly by mitotic arrest and checkpoint
activation and not by other consequences of changes in
microtubule dynamics. The only significant difference we noted
between the drugs was a greater extent of apoptosis and its
molecular correlates caused by paclitaxel compared with K5I and
nocodazole. This difference was subtle (<2-fold) and only evident in
lines with intermediate sensitivity to apoptosis, but in those lines,
it was reproducible with both microscopy and molecular assays.
The slightly greater toxicity of paclitaxel, normalized to equal
mitotic arrest, suggests it may activate additional pathways that

lead to apoptosis. Molecular identification of these pathways is an
important future direction.
Although human cancer cell lines cannot represent the
complexity of real tumors, they provide a model for studying
molecular mechanisms involved in drug responses, and to the
limited extent that data are available, we argue our results are
concordant with tumor data. We observed large variation in
apoptosis responses and less in spindle assembly and checkpoint
responses and suggest the former may be the dominant source of
variation in clinical responses to antimitotics in drug-naive tumors.
Improvements in chemotherapy may come from combining
antimitotics with drugs that appropriately modulate apoptotic
pathways.
