Abstract
HER2 is a validated target in breast cancer therapy. Two drugs
are currently approved for HER2-positive breast cancer:
trastuzumab (Herceptin), introduced in 1998, and lapatinib
(Tykerb), in 2007. Despite these advances, some patients
progress through therapy and succumb to their disease. A
variation on antibody-targeted therapy is utilization of antibodies to deliver cytotoxic agents specifically to antigenexpressing tumors. We determined in vitro and in vivo efficacy,
pharmacokinetics, and toxicity of trastuzumab-maytansinoid
(microtubule-depolymerizing agents) conjugates using disulfide and thioether linkers. Antiproliferative effects of trastuzumab-maytansinoid conjugates were evaluated on cultured
normal and tumor cells. In vivo activity was determined in
mouse breast cancer models, and toxicity was assessed in rats
as measured by body weight loss. Surprisingly, trastuzumab
linked to DM1 through a nonreducible thioether linkage
(SMCC), displayed superior activity compared with unconjugated trastuzumab or trastuzumab linked to other maytansinoids through disulfide linkers. Serum concentrations of
trastuzumab-MCC-DM1 remained elevated compared with
other conjugates, and toxicity in rats was negligible compared
with free DM1 or trastuzumab linked to DM1 through a
reducible linker. Potent activity was observed on all HER2overexpressing tumor cells, whereas nontransformed cells
and tumor cell lines with normal HER2 expression were
unaffected. In addition, trastuzumab-DM1 was active on HER2overexpressing, trastuzumab-refractory tumors. In summary,
trastuzumab-DM1 shows greater activity compared with
nonconjugated trastuzumab while maintaining selectivity for
HER2-overexpressing tumor cells. Because trastuzumab linked
to DM1 through a nonreducible linker offers improved efficacy
and pharmacokinetics and reduced toxicity over the reducible
disulfide linkers evaluated, trastuzumab-MCC-DM1 was selected for clinical development. [Cancer Res 2008;68(22):9280–90]

receptors. These receptors, which also include HER3 (ErbB3) and
HER4 (ErbB4), are known to play critical roles in both development
and cancer (1, 2). Importantly, amplification and overexpression of
HER2 occur in 20% to 25% of human breast cancer and are
predictive of poor clinical outcome (3, 4). Because of the role of
HER2 in breast cancer pathogenesis and the accessibility of the
extracellular portion of the receptor, HER2 was recognized as a
potential candidate for targeted antibody therapy. The humanized
HER2 antibody, trastuzumab (Herceptin), was approved by the
Food and Drug Administration in 1998 for use in metastatic breast
cancer and has subsequently shown clinical benefit when used, in
combination with cytotoxic chemotherapy, as first-line or adjuvant
therapy (5, 6). Importantly, trastuzumab improves overall survival
in early breast cancer after chemotherapy compared with
observation alone (6). Increased survival after only 2 years of
follow-up is impressive in breast cancer. Tamoxifen is the only
other breast cancer treatment that is reported to offer a survival
benefit in this short-time period (6).
Although the mechanisms for response to trastuzumab are not
completely understood, clinical benefit is attributed to interference
with signal transduction pathways, impairment of extracellular
domain (ECD) cleavage, inhibition of DNA repair, decreased
angiogenesis; as well as induction of cell cycle arrest, and
antibody-mediated cellular cytotoxicity (7, 8). Despite these diverse
mechanisms of action, a significant proportion of patients treated
with trastuzumab either do not respond initially or relapse after
experiencing a period of clinical response (5, 9). Progression
through trastuzumab-containing therapy is attributed to aberrant
activation of signaling pathways, such as the phosphatidylinositol
3-kinase pathway (10–12), activation of compensatory signaling
either through up-regulation of the insulin-like growth factor-I
receptor (13, 14) or ErbB/HER ligands (15, 16) or generation of a
constitutively active truncated form of HER2, designated p95HER2
(17, 18).
Direct covalent coupling of cytotoxic agents to monoclonal
antibodies is an alternative to naked antibody-targeted therapy.
To date, antitumor antibodies have been linked to cytotoxic agents,
such as the calicheamicins, auristatins, maytansinoids and
derivatives of CC1065 (19–22). Currently, only one such conjugate,
anti-CD33 conjugated to calicheamicin (gemtuzumab ozogamicin
or Mylotarg), has been granted marketing approval for the
treatment of relapsed acute myeloid leukemia (23).
Maytansinoids are derivatives of the antimitotic drug maytansine. These agents bind directly to microtubules in a manner
similar to the Vinca alkaloids (24, 25). Antibody-maytansinoid
conjugates directed toward cancer antigens, such as CanAg
(cantuzumab mertansine and IMGN242), prostate-specific membrane antigen (MLN2704), CD56 (IMGN901), CD33 (AVE9633), and

Trastuzumab-DM1 Antibody-Drug Conjugate

CD44v6 (bivatuzumab mertansine) are in early stages of clinical
testing (20, 26–28). Because HER2 is highly differentially expressed
on breast tumor cells (1–2 million copies per cell) compared with
normal epithelial cells, HER2 represents an ideal target for
antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) therapy. Numerous preclinical
and clinical studies indicate that trastuzumab combines extremely
well with microtubule-directed agents (29–32). Given the mechanism of action and potency of maytansine, it was deemed to be a
particularly attractive cytotoxic agent to conjugate to trastuzumab.
Herein, we describe the efficacy, pharmacokinetic properties, and
safety of several trastuzumab-maytansinoid conjugates, with
particular emphasis on the chemical nature of the linker.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines and reagents. Tumor cell lines (breast carcinoma BT-474, SKBR-3, MCF7, MDA-MB-468, MDA-MB-361, HCC1954, lung carcinoma Calu 3,
and ovarian carcinoma line SK-OV-3) and MCF 10A breast epithelial cells
were obtained from American Type Culture Collection. The breast tumor
line KPL-4 was obtained from Dr. J. Kurebayashi (33), and MKN7 gastric
carcinoma cells were from Mitsubishi Corp. Cells were maintained in Ham’s
F-12: high glucose DMEM (50:50) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated
fetal bovine serum and 2 mmol/L L-glutamine (all from Invitrogen Corp.).
Normal human cell lines [human mammary epithelial cells (HMEC) and
normal human epidermal keratinocytes (NHEK)] and the corresponding
culture medium (MEGM and KGM, respectively) were obtained from
Cambrex. The BT474-EEI cell line was derived by subculturing BT-474
tumors grown in vivo in the absence of estrogen pellet supplementation
(exogenous estrogen independent) and is resistant both in vitro and in vivo
to trastuzumab treatment.
Active agents used for cell culture and animal studies were the antibody
trastuzumab (Genentech, Inc.), trastuzumab-maytansinoid ADC (ImmunoGen, Inc.), and the control ADC, anti–IL-8-MCC-DM1. The maytansinoid,
DM1, was conjugated to trastuzumab through SPP, SMCC, or SPDP linkers
(Fig. 1; refs. 24, 34); the thiol-containing maytansinoids, DM3 and DM4,

which have methyl groups adjacent to their sulfhydryl group were linked to
trastuzumab with the SSNPP linker (ImmunoGen, Inc.). All trastuzumab
ADCs had an average molar ratio of 3 to 3.6 maytansinoid molecules per
antibody. The drug-antibody molar ratio for trastuzumab-MCC-DM1 and
trastuzumab-SPP-DM1 was 3.2 for cell culture and xenograft studies, 3.6 for
trastuzumab-SPP-DM1 used in the rat toxicity study, and 3.8 for anti–IL-8MCC-DM1.
Cell viability and cell death assays. The effects of trastuzumab and
trastuzumab-maytansinoid conjugates on tumor cell viability were assessed
using Cell Titer-Glo (Promega Corp.). Cells were plated in black-walled
96-well plates (20,000 per well for BT-474; 10,000 cells per well for all other
lines) and allowed to adhere overnight at 37jC in a humidified atmosphere
of 5% CO2. Medium was then removed and replaced by fresh culture
medium containing different concentrations of trastuzumab, trastuzumab
ADC, or free DM1, and the cells incubated for varying periods of time. After
each time point, Cell Titer-Glo reagent was added to the wells for 10 min at
room temperature and the luminescent signal was measured using a
Packard/Perkin-Elmer TopCount. For measurement of apoptosis, BT-474
and SK-BR-3 were exposed to trastuzumab or trastuzumab-MCC-DM1 for
48 h. Caspase activation was assessed by adding Caspase-Glo 3/7 reagent
(Promega Corp.) for 30 min at room temperature, and the luminescence
was recorded using a Packard TopCount. Induction of cytotoxicity was
assessed in cells treated with trastuzumab or trastuzumab-MCC-DM1 for
72 h using ToxiLight Bioassay kit (Cambrex/Lonza). This assay measures
release of the intracellular enzyme adenylate kinase as a result of cell lysis.
Normal HMEC and NHEK were plated in clear 96-well plates at densities
of 10,000 and 8,000 cells per well, respectively, and allowed to adhere
overnight. Cells were treated with trastuzumab or trastuzumab-MCC-DM1
for 72 h. Alamar Blue reagent (Trek Diagnostics Systems) was added to all
wells, plates were incubated for 3 h at 37jC, and fluorescence was measured
on a SpectraMax 190 (Molecular Devices) using 530-nm excitation and
590-nm emission. Because the normal cell lines were not healthy when
grown in black multiplates (which is necessary for use of Cell Titer-Glo),
Alamar Blue was used as the proliferation read-out. For all cellular assays,
dose-response curves were generated using Kaleidagraph 4.0 (Synergy
Software) four-parameter curve fitting.

Western immunoblot analysis. SK-BR-3 cells were seeded at a density
of 1 million per dish in 100  15 mm dishes and allowed to adhere for 2 d.
The medium was then removed and replaced with fresh medium
containing either trastuzumab, free DM1, or a range of concentrations of
trastuzumab-MCC-DM1. After a 48-h incubation, floating cells were
collected and combined with detached adherent cells. The total cell
population was then centrifuged and resuspended in lysis buffer [50 mmol/L
HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mmol/L NaCl, 1.5 mmol/L MgCl2, 1.0 mmol/L EGTA,
10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mmol/L Na4P2O4, 1 mmol/L Na3VO4,
50 mmol/L NaF, 1 Amol/L leupeptin, 0.3 Amol/L aprotinin, 1 Amol/L
pepstatin A, 10 Amol/L bestatin, and 1.4 Amol/L E-64]. Lysates were cleared
by centrifugation at 4jC for 15 min at 20,800  g in a microcentrifuge, and
protein concentrations were determined using the bicinchoninic acid (BCA)
protein assay kit (Pierce). Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred
to nitrocellulose, and immunoblotted with a polyclonal antibody against
poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), which recognizes intact 116-kDa PARP
and the 23-kDa cleavage fragment (R&D Systems). Blotting was carried out
in TBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 5% nonfat dry milk, followed by
incubation with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)–conjugated secondary antibodies (Amersham Biosciences). Proteins were visualized using enhanced
chemiluminescence reagents (Amersham Biosciences).
Measurement of total and phosphorylated HER2 and p95HER2 in
transgenic tumors was performed as follows. Tumors from the founder 5
(Fo5; ref. 35) and founder 2#1282 (F2#1282) lineages of MMTV-HER2
transgenic mice (Genentech, Inc.) were excised from the animals, placed in
lysis buffer containing protease inhibitors, and homogenized on ice. Tumor
lysates were centrifuged, and total protein levels in the supernatant were
determined using a BCA protein assay kit. HER2 was immunoprecipitated
overnight at 4jC using the mouse monoclonal antibody Ab-15 (Lab Vision)
complexed to protein A/G sepharose, with 1 mg total protein from at least
three independent tumor lysates. Complexes were pelleted by centrifugation, washed twice with lysis buffer, resuspended in SDS sample buffer, and
boiled. Samples were separated on a 4% to 12% Tris-glycine gel and
transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Blots were probed with mouse
monoclonal antibody Ab-18 (Lab Vision) to detect the phosphorylated
forms of HER2 and p95HER2 or with Ab-15 to detect total HER2 and
p95HER2.
In vivo efficacy and pharmacokinetic studies. Tumor tissue from
Fo5 or F2#1282 HER2 transgenic mice was collected aseptically, rinsed in
HBSS, and cut into pieces of f2  2 mm in size. These pieces were
surgically transplanted into the mammary fat pad of female nu/nu mice
(Charles River Laboratories). For efficacy studies using BT474EEI cells,
naive female beige nude XID mice (Harlan Sprague-Dawley) were
inoculated in the mammary fat pad with 20 million tumor cells
suspended in 50% phenol red–free Matrigel (Becton Dickinson Bioscience)
mixed with culture medium. All animals were randomly assigned into
treatment groups, such that the mean tumor volume for each group was
100 to 200 mm3. Trastuzumab or trastuzumab-maytansinoid conjugates
were given by either a single i.v. injection or injection once every 3 wk.
Vehicle control was either PBS ( for pharmacokinetic studies) or ADC
formulation buffer [10 mmol/L sodium succinate, 0.1% polysorbate
(Tween) 20, 20 mg/mL trehalose dihydrate (pH5.0)]. Similarly, KPL-4
human breast tumor cells were inoculated (3 million cells per mouse, in
Matrigel) into the mammary fat pads of SCID beige mice (Charles River
Laboratories). Trastuzumab (15 mg/kg) was given i.p. once per week for
4 wk; trastuzumab-MCC-DM1 (15 mg/kg) was given i.v. (single injection
on treatment day 0). All treatment groups consisted of 6 to 10 animals per
group, and tumor size was monitored twice weekly using caliper
measurement. Mice were housed in standard rodent microisolator cages.
Environmental controls for the animal rooms were set to maintain a
temperature of f70jF, a relative humidity of 40% to 60%, and an
approximate 14-h light/10-h dark cycle.
For pharmacokinetic analysis of trastuzumab-maytansinoid conjugates,
female beige nude mice (age 15–20 wk; Harlan Sprague-Dawley) were
injected i.v. with 2 mg/kg of different trastuzumab ADCs ( four mice per
group). To assess circulating levels of total and conjugated antibody, blood
was collected via cardiac puncture from three animals at 5 min and 1, 6, 24,

72, and 168 h postinjection. The samples were left at room temperature for
30 min until the blood coagulated. Subsequently, serum was obtained by
centrifuging the samples at 10,000  g for 5 min at 4jC, after which serum
samples were stored at 70jC. Total trastuzumab concentration in the
serum samples was measured as follows: 96-well ELISA plates were coated
with HER2 ECD in 0.05 mol/L carbonate/bicarbonate buffer (pH 9.6) at 4jC
overnight. After removal of the coat solution, nonspecific binding sites were
blocked by incubating with blocking solution [0.5% bovine serum albumin
(BSA) in PBS] for 1 to 2 h. The plates were then washed with wash buffer
(0.05% Tween in PBS), and standards or samples diluted in ELISA assay
buffer [PBS containing 0.5% BSA, 0.05% Tween, 10 ppm proclin 300, 0.2%
bovine g-globulin, 0.25% CHAPS, 0.35 mol/L NaCl, 5 mmol/L EDTA (pH 7.4)]
were added. After a 2-h incubation, plates were washed and HRPconjugated goat anti-human Fc (The Jackson Laboratory) was added for
an additional 2 h. Plates were then washed again, followed by the addition
of tetramethyl benzidine substrate for color development. The reaction was
stopped after 10 to 15 min by the addition of 1 mol/L phosphoric acid.
Plates were read on a Molecular Devices microplate reader at a wavelength
of 450 to 630 nm. The concentration of trastuzumab in the samples was
extrapolated from a four-variable fit of the standard curve. For
measurement of trastuzumab-maytansinoid concentration, wells were
coated with anti-DM antibody (GNE DM1-3586) and serum samples
added as above. After the 2-h sample incubation, the plates were washed,
60 ng/mL biotin-conjugated HER2 ECD was added to each well, and the
plates were incubated for 1 h. Plates were then washed, and HRPconjugated streptavidin (GE Healthcare) was added for an additional
30-min incubation. Color detection and measurement were performed as
described above. Previous analyses of different preparations of trastuzumab-DM1 conjugates with drug-antibody ratios ranging from 1.9 to 3.8
showed that the conjugated antibody ELISA is not sensitive to drug load.
Circulating HER2 ECD levels from mice harboring Fo5 or F2#1282
xenograft tumors was measured, as previously described (35). Briefly, serum
was diluted 1:50 with ELISA assay buffer (above) followed by 1:2 serial
dilutions. HER2 ECD was captured using goat anti-HER2 polyclonal
antibody (Genentech, Inc.) and detected with biotin-conjugated rabbit
anti-Her2 polyclonal (Genentech, Inc.), followed by addition of streptavidinHRP.
Rat toxicity studies. Female Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 75 to 80 g
were obtained from Charles River Laboratories and allowed to acclimate
for 5 d before study. Trastuzumab-SPP-DM1, trastuzumab-MCC-DM1,
and free DM1 were diluted in PBS (Invitrogen Corp.) as vehicle and given
as a single i.v. bolus tail-vein injection on day 1 at a dose volume of
10 mL/kg. Body weights were measured predose on day 1 and daily
thereafter for 5 d.

Results
Linker optimization. Antibody-DM1 conjugates were originally
designed with a disulfide-based linker for release of active drug by
intracellular reduction (24). Recently, it was discovered that the
endocytic pathway is oxidizing and that cleavage of the disulfide
linker, SPP, is very inefficient (36). Thus, different trastuzumab
ADCs were constructed to investigate the effect of disulfide linker
hindrance on the biological activity of these conjugates (Fig. 1). A
trastuzumab-DM1 conjugate made with the SPDP linker contains
no methyl substitutions adjacent to the disulfide bond and is
therefore the least hindered disulfide-containing design. Trastuzumab ADCs composed of SPP-DM1, SSNPP-DM3, or SSNPP-DM4
contain one, two, or three methyl groups, respectively, around the
disulfide bridge and show increasing resistance to cleavage via
thiol-disulfide exchange reactions.3 DM3 and DM4 nomenclature

reflects addition of methyl groups to the DM1 (drug) moiety
(addition of one or two methyls, respectively). An additional ADC
containing a thioether linker (SMCC, designated MCC after
conjugation) was also constructed. In vitro potency assays were
conducted for 3 days with the HER2-amplified breast cancer lines
BT-474 and SK-BR-3 treated with various trastuzumab ADCs. This
short treatment period was selected to minimize the effects of
unconjugated trastuzumab on these trastuzumab-sensitive lines.
The graphs in Fig. 2A show enhanced potency of trastuzumabmaytansinoid conjugates compared with trastuzumab in both cell
lines, with no significant difference in activity among the various
ADCs tested (IC50, 0.085–0.148 Ag/mL for BT-474 and 0.007–
0.018 Ag/mL for SK-BR-3). Because the effect of trastuzumab is
cytostatic in nature, the enhanced potency of the ADC is, thus, due
to exposure of the cells to the cytotoxic maytansinoid. In addition,
brief exposure of SK-BR-3 cells for 10, 30, or 60 minutes to
trastuzumab-MCC-DM1, followed by a 3-day incubation in culture
medium, also resulted in substantial growth inhibition (data not
shown). When comparing potency as molar DM1 equivalents, DM1
conjugated to trastuzumab is 5-fold more potent than free L-DM1
on SK-BR-3 and shows equal potency to free L-DM1 on BT-474 cells
(Fig. 2B). Nontargeted effects of trastuzumab-maytansinoid conjugates were assessed on breast cancer lines expressing normal
levels (MCF7) or lacking expression (MDA-MB-468) of HER2 (37).
All ADCs tested showed minimal antiproliferative activity in both
cell lines (Fig. 2A), whereas free DM1 showed potency equal to that
observed on the HER2-amplified lines (Fig. 2B). Treatment of the
four cell lines with an isotype-matched control ADC, anti–IL-8MCC-DM1, resulted in negligible growth inhibition (data not
shown). Thus, like trastuzumab, maytansinoid-conjugated trastuzumab ADCs are specific for HER2-overexpressing cells. Furthermore, the different linkers behave similarly with respect to in vitro
antiproliferative activity.
Pharmacokinetic analyses in nude mice were performed to
determine the effect of different trastuzumab ADC linkers on
serum concentration. In contrast to the cell culture results,
we observed a clear correlation between ADC exposure and
linker hindrance. The ADC with the least hindered disulfide bond
(no adjacent methyl groups), trastuzumab-SPDP-DM1, showed the
fastest clearance and was undetectable by day 3. The addition of
methyl groups (CH3) on either side of the S-S bond (trastuzumabSPP-DM1 with one CH3 on the antibody side of the S-S;
trastuzumab-SSNPP-DM3 with two CH3, one on either side of
the S-S; trastuzumab-SSNPP-DM4 with three CH3, one on the
antibody side, and two on the drug side of the S-S) resulted in
increasingly sustained ADC serum concentrations (Fig. 3A, left).
Trastuzumab-MCC-DM1 (nonreducible) and trastuzumab-SSNPPDM4 (the most hindered disulfide-containing design) showed
similar pharmacokinetics with the ADC concentration at 70% of
the total antibody at day 7. Studies were also performed to
compare clearance of DM1-conjugated trastuzumab to total
trastuzumab levels (Fig. 3A, right). Serum concentrations of
trastuzumab-MCC-DM1 measured for 1 week were not different
from total serum trastuzumab concentration, indicating that, with
the nonreducible MCC linker, the amount of maytansinoid
released from the antibody was negligible over the 7 days. In
contrast, only 11% of the trastuzumab-SPP-DM1, compared with
total trastuzumab antibody concentration, remained in the
circulation after 7 days.
In vivo efficacy studies examining the different trastuzumabmaytansinoid conjugates given as a single i.v. dose were carried

out using the MMTV-HER2 Fo5 mammary tumor transplant
(trastuzumab-resistant) model. This model was developed by
serial transplantation of tumors derived from the HER2
transgenic mouse lineage founder 5 (35). These mouse tumors
overexpress human HER2 (3+ expression) as measured by
immunohistochemistry and quantitative reverse transcription–
PCR. Interestingly, established tumors from this model do not
respond to single-agent trastuzumab therapy. Consistent with the
pharmacokinetic analysis, increased linker stability in vivo
correlated with increased antitumor activity for trastuzumab
ADCs (Fig. 3B). Tumor volume in both trastuzumab-MCC-DM1
and trastuzumab-SSNPP-DM3 treatment groups were statistically
different from trastuzumab-SPP-DM1 (log-rank P values of 0.0165
and 0.0414, respectively). Further characterization of the HER2
transgenic models revealed the presence of high circulating levels
of shed HER2 ECD in the serum of Fo5 tumor-bearing mice.
Moreover, analysis of these tumors revealed increased expression
of the transmembrane-containing fragment p95HER2, which is
highly tyrosine-phosphorylated, indicating constitutive activation.
In comparison, the trastuzumab-sensitive F2#1282 model showed
1,000-fold lower levels of circulating HER2 ECD, no detectable
p95HER2, and significant tumor growth reduction after a single
injection of different doses of trastuzumab-DM1 (data not
shown). Thus, the trastuzumab-DM1 conjugate is efficacious in
models, such as Fo5, which express reported markers of
resistance to trastuzumab, i.e., high circulating HER2 ECD and
activated p95HER2.
Short-term, single-dose toxicity studies were performed in
female rats comparing the effects on body weight of free or
conjugated (SMCC or SPP) DM1. ADCs were given as DM1
equivalents (Ag/m2). As trastuzumab does not recognize rat
erbB2, this model measures antigen-independent ADC effects. Of
the agents tested, trastuzumab-MCC-DM1 showed the best safety
profile. Body weight gain in rats given 1,632 Ag/m2 DM1 (25 mg/
kg antibody) was comparable with vehicle control animals (15.9%
and 16.3%, respectively; Fig. 3C). In contrast, administration of
trastuzumab-SPP-DM1 at an equivalent DM1 dose resulted in
considerable body weight loss ( 10%) by end of study. Rats
treated with 3,264 Ag/m2 (50 mg/kg) trastuzumab-MCC-DM1 did
not exhibit body weight loss; however, the amount of weight
gained during the course of study (+6.7%) was less than in the
vehicle control and the 1,632 Ag/m2 trastuzumab-MCC-DM1
groups. The change in body weight with 3,264 Ag/m2 trastuzumab-MCC-DM1 was similar to that observed with free DM1 at a
dose of 653 Ag/m2 (+6.5%). In a separate study, clinical chemistry
analysis of rats treated with trastuzumab-MCC-DM1 showed
transient elevation of liver enzymes (aspartate aminotransferase,
alanine aminotransferase, and g-glutamyl transpeptidase) and
mild, reversible thrombocytopenia at a dose of 20 mg/kg, and no
clinical signs of toxicity at 6 mg/kg (data not shown). Evidently,
substituting a reducible linker (SPP) with a nonreducible linker
(SMCC) results in a less toxic but still efficacious trastuzumabDM1 conjugate. Consequently, further studies focused on defining
the activity of trastuzumab-MCC-DM1.
HER2-overexpressing, trastuzumab-resistant tumor cells
respond to trastuzumab-MCC-DM1, whereas normal cell lines
are unaffected. The effects of trastuzumab-MCC-DM1 on in vitro
proliferation were further examined in several tumor lines shown
to be resistant to trastuzumab. Additional breast cancer lines,
HCC1954, KPL-4, and BT-474 EEI, all with 3+ HER2 expression,
were first tested. The BT-474 EEI cell line was developed by

Trastuzumab-DM1 Antibody-Drug Conjugate

Figure 3. Trastuzumab conjugated to DM1 through the thioether SMCC linker displays better efficacy and pharmacokinetics and lower toxicity than conjugates
with disulfide linkers. A, pharmacokinetic analysis of trastuzumab-maytansinoid conjugates shows increased serum concentrations of conjugates with more hindered
disulfide linkers. Female beige nude mice were given a single i.v. injection (2 mg/kg) of different trastuzumab-maytansinoid conjugates (n = 4 mice per group).
Serum samples were collected at various time points after injection for measurement of total and conjugated trastuzumab as described. B, increased in vivo linker
stability results in improved efficacy in vivo . Mice bearing mammary tumor transplants from the MMTV-HER2 Fo5 line were given a single i.v. injection (10 mg/kg)
of Tmab-SPP-DM1, Tmab-SSNPP-DM3, Tmab-SSNPP-DM4, Tmab-MCC-DM1, or vehicle (n = 7 mice per group), and tumor growth was monitored for 25 d.
C, Tmab-MCC-DM1 displays the best safety profile, as assessed by changes in body weight, of the conjugates tested. Female Sprague-Dawley rats were given a
single i.v. injection of Tmab-MCC-DM1 (1,632 or 3,264 Ag/m2, 25 or 50 mg/kg, respectively), Tmab-SPP-DM1 (1,632 Ag/m2), or free DM1 (653 Ag/m2) on day 1,
and body weights were measured daily for 5 d. To give equivalent doses of DM1, animals in the Tmab-SPP-DM1 group were given 22 mg/kg due to the higher
drug-antibody ratio (3.6) compared with Tmab-MCC-DM1 (3.2).

subculturing BT-474 tumors grown in vivo in the absence of
estrogen pellet supplementation. The cell line established in this
manner, while maintaining high levels of HER2 expression, had
surprisingly become resistant to trastuzumab (G.P. and L.C.) and
provides a useful model for determining efficacy of trastuzumab
ADCs. These three breast cancer lines showed the same degree of
sensitivity to trastuzumab-MCC-DM1 as the sensitive lines SK-BR-3
and BT-474 (Fig. 4A). Moreover, tumor lines from different tissues
of origin were also responsive to treatment with trastuzumabMCC-DM1. Calu 3 lung carcinoma (3+ HER2), SK-OV-3 ovarian
carcinoma (2+ HER2), and MKN7 gastric carcinoma (2+ HER2) cells
(37) displayed dose-dependent inhibition of cell growth upon
treatment with the ADC while showing no response to nonconjugated trastuzumab (Fig. 4B). In contrast, exposure of normal

www.aacrjournals.org

human cells, HMEC and NHEK, to trastuzumab-MCC-DM1
resulted in minimal growth inhibition, similar to that observed
on HER2 nonamplified MCF-7 and MDA-MB-468 breast carcinoma
cells (Fig. 4C).
Trastuzumab-MCC-DM1 induces cell death in HER2-overexpressing breast cancer cells. Further studies were performed to
address the mechanism(s) of action of trastuzumab-MCC-DM1.
Cell cycle analysis of conjugate-treated cells resulted in the
expected arrest in the G2-M phase (data not shown), a known
mechanism of agents that inhibit microtubule function. We
examined the effects on cell death induction, as well. Trastuzumab-MCC-DM1 induced a dose-dependent increase in cell death in
SK-BR-3 and BT-474 cells (Fig. 5), with EC50 values (in parentheses)
similar to those observed in proliferation assays. Release of the

intracellular enzyme adenylate kinase into the culture medium,
an indicator of cellular lysis, was observed after treatment with
trastuzumab-MCC-DM1 for 3 days (Fig. 5A). Activation of caspase3/caspase-7 also occurred in these cell lines after a 2-day treatment
with trastuzumab-MCC-DM1, indicating induction of apoptotic cell

death (Fig. 5B). Proteolytic cleavage of 116-kDa PARP with release
of the 23-kDa fragment, a known hallmark of apoptotic cell death,
was also examined. PARP cleavage was observed in SK-BR-3 cells
treated for 48 hours with 100 and 300 ng/mL trastuzumab-MCCDM1, as well as with 20 nmol/L free DM1, indicating induction of

C, trastuzumabMCC-DM1 and free DM1 induce PARP cleavage, whereas unconjugated trastuzumab has no effect. SK-BR-3 cells were treated with 10 Ag/mL trastuzumab;

of cleaved PARP. Appearance of the 23-kDa PARP fragment indicates apoptotic activation of PARP cleavage.

apoptosis (Fig. 5C). Thus, in contrast to the cytostatic action of
trastuzumab (7, 30), these data show that treatment of HER2amplified breast tumor cells with trastuzumab-MCC-DM1 results
in apoptotic cell death and cellular lysis.
Trastuzumab-MCC-DM1 inhibits growth and causes tumor
regression in animal models of HER2-positive breast cancer.
The in vivo efficacy of trastuzumab-MCC-DM1 was compared with
trastuzumab in three mouse models of HER2-overexpressing breast
cancer. KPL-4 human breast tumor cells were implanted into the
mammary fat pads of SCID beige mice and tumors allowed to grow
to an average size of 300 mm3. Mice were then treated weekly
with 15 mg/kg trastuzumab i.p. or given a single i.v. injection of

15 mg/kg trastuzumab-MCC-DM1. Complete tumor regression for
the duration of the study (126 days), as determined by caliper
measurement, was observed in mice receiving trastuzumab-MCCDM1, whereas unconjugated trastuzumab induced an initial
decrease in tumor size, followed by regrowth upon cessation of
treatment (Fig. 6A). Although the KPL4 cell line did not respond to
trastuzumab in vitro, we have observed with other cell lines, such
as Calu 3, response to trastuzumab in vivo, despite lack of
responsiveness in vitro.
The activity of trastuzumab-MCC-DM1 was further investigated
in two trastuzumab-insensitive mouse xenograft models. After
transplantation of MMTV-HER2 Fo5 mammary tumor explants,

grown as tumors in SCID beige mice show complete regression after a single i.v. injection of trastuzumab-MCC-DM1 (15 mg/kg, 750 Ag/m2 DM1) compared with
transient regression followed by regrowth after weekly treatment with 15 mg/kg trastuzumab (n = 8 mice per group). B, MMTV-HER2 transgenic transplants from
trastuzumab-resistant line Fo5 respond to trastuzumab-MCC-DM1 in a dose-dependent manner (left). Injections were given once every 3 wk for three total injections at
doses of 1, 3, 10, 15, and 30 mg/kg (50, 150, 500, 750, and 1,500 Ag/m2 DM1, respectively); n = 8 mice per group. Isotype-matched control ADC, anti–IL-8-MCC-DM1
(15 mg/kg, 840 Ag/m2 DM1; drug-antibody ratio, 3.8) showed no antitumor activity (right ). C, dose-response of trastuzumab-resistant xenograft line BT-474 EEI

every 3 wk for a total of three injections, n = 10 mice per group.

tumor-bearing nude mice were treated once every 3 weeks with
1, 3, 10, 15, or 30 mg/kg trastuzmab-MCC-DM1 (50, 150, 500,
750, and 1500 Ag/m2 of conjugated DM1, respectively; Fig. 6B).
Doses of 1 and 3 mg/kg showed no antitumor activity, whereas
administration of 10 mg/kg resulted in partial inhibition of tumor
growth (this treatment group was discontinued after 30 days due to
several mice having tumors in excess of 1,000 mm3). Tumors in mice
treated with either 15 or 30 mg/kg trastuzumab-MCC-DM1
regressed during the entire course of treatment. Regrowth was
observed f30 days after discontinuation of treatment. Previous
studies have shown that retreatment with trastuzumab-MCC-DM1
results in a further decrease in tumor size, indicating that
acquisition of resistance did not occur (data not shown).
In contrast, treatment with 15 mg/kg of an irrelevant control
ADC, anti-IL-8-MCC-DM1, resulted in no tumor growth inhibition
(Fig. 6B, right).
The second trastuzumab-resistant model used the BT-474 EEI
tumor-derived line. The data in Fig. 6C show the effects on BT-474
EEI tumor growth of different doses of trastuzumab-MCC-DM1
given once every 3 weeks for three total doses. Dose-dependent
inhibition of tumor growth was observed, with 0.3, 1 and 3 mg/kg
causing tumor growth delay, whereas 10 and 15 mg/kg doses
resulted in tumor regression. Thus, trastuzumab-MCC-DM1 shows
potent activity in trastuzumab-sensitive and trastuzumab-insensitive mouse xenograft models, with 15 mg/kg as the maximum
efficacious dose.

Discussion
The anatomy of an antibody–cytotoxic drug conjugate can be
divided into three general components: the antibody, the linker,
and the cytotoxic drug. The efficacy of any such conjugate is
dictated in part by the differential expression of the target
antigen in tumor versus normal tissue. HER2 is a clinically
validated target for the treatment of breast cancer. Trastuzumab
(5, 35–41) and, more recently, lapatinib (42) are approved for
clinical use in women whose breast cancer overexpresses HER2.
To be maximally effective, both trastuzumab and lapatinib
require a functional or signaling HER2 receptor, which drives key
biological aspects of the tumor. It is postulated that patients
whose tumors progress on these therapies may acquire
alterations that activate signal transduction pathways either
downstream or parallel to HER2. At present, available data
indicate that cancer cells do not lose HER2 expression when
they become refractory to HER2-directed therapies (14, 16). For
that reason, a trastuzumab conjugate, which simply uses HER2
as an address for the delivery of a potent cytotoxic agent, may
offer promise as an effective therapeutic modality.
We observed that anti-HER2 ADCs display impressive potency
in vitro and in vivo and are active in trastuzumab-refractory models
of HER2-amplified breast cancer. However, the tolerability of these
conjugates varies considerably and is intrinsically dependent upon
the chemical nature of the linker and the cytotoxic agent. In this
report, we describe our characterization of several trastuzumabmaytansinoid conjugates with a special emphasis on linker
chemistry. The disulfide-linked DM1-containing ADCs were
designed to allow for endosomal reduction of the disulfide to
result in intracellular release of the cytotoxic agent. Moreover, in
antigen-expressing tumor cells, DM1 derived from ADCs designed
with a disulfide linker can be released by the tumor cells and
initiate a ‘‘bystander’’ killing effect (34). However, in vivo, the

www.aacrjournals.org

liberated DM1 is also rapidly cleared and, thus, may not be
available for prolonged antitumor effects (43). Our results with the
thioether (MCC) linker contradicted the hypothesis that selective
release of DM1 by intracellular reduction of the disulfide bond in a
trastuzumab-disulfide-DM1 conjugate was necessary for efficacy.
Similar to huC242-MCC-DM1, a thioether-containing ADC that
targets the CanAg antigen (34, 44), trastuzumab-MCC-DM1 is
internalized upon binding to HER2-overexpressing tumor cells and
is postulated to undergo intracellular proteolytic degradation to
release active maytansinoid. As expected, the activity of trastuzumab-MCC-DM1 is blocked in the presence of protease inhibitors in
cell culture experiments (data not shown). Subsequently, it has
been shown that HER2 itinerary allows for lysosomal degradation
of HER2-directed ADCs (45). Thus, it is likely that the trastuzumab
antibody component of the trastuzumab-MCC-DM1 conjugate
undergoes proteolytic degradation in the lysosome and that lysineMCC-DM1 is a major active metabolite, as has been shown for
huC242-MCC-DM1 (44). In fact, preliminary data from studies
investigating the metabolism of [3H]trastuzumab-MCC-DM1 in BT474 EEI cells show lysine-Nq-MCC-DM1 as the predominant
metabolite (data not shown). The primary active metabolite,
lysine-MCC-DM1, does not readily cross the plasma membranes of
neighboring cells and, therefore, does not elicit a bystander effect
(34, 44).
Non–disulfide-containing ADCs show increased pharmacokinetic
exposure in both rats and cynomolgus monkeys (data not shown).
This increase in conjugate exposure did not lead to an increase
in either target-dependent or target-independent toxicity. As
expected, trastuzumab conjugated to DM1 through the thioether
MCC linker was better tolerated compared with the disulfide
(SPP) linked to DM1, with regard to toxicity signals. Despite the
improved pharmacokinetic profile of DM3 and DM4-containing
trastuzumab conjugates, the disulfide linkage would likely render
these conjugates less tolerable than the thioether-linked trastuzumab conjugate.
In summary, trastuzumab-MCC-DM1 is shown to be efficacious
in trastuzumab-sensitive and trastuzumab-insensitive models of
HER2-overexpressing cancer. Of equal importance, trastuzumabMCC-DM1 has a favorable pharmacokinetic and safety profile
compared with disulfide-linked trastuzumab conjugates and
represents an important new approach for treating HER2-amplified
human cancers. Given these promising results, early clinical studies
are currently under way to assess the safety and efficacy of
trastuzumab-MCC-DM1 in patients whose disease has progressed
through HER2-directed therapies.
