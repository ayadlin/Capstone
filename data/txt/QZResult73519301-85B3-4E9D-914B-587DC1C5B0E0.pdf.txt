ABSTRACT
The oncoprotein EZH2, as a histone H3K27 methyltransferase, is frequently
overexpressed in various cancer types. However, the mechanisms underlying its
role in urinary bladder cancer (UBC) cells have not yet fully understood. Herein, we
reported that honokiol, a biologically active biphenolic compound isolated from the
Magnolia officinalis inhibited human UBC cell proliferation, survival, cancer stemness,
migration, and invasion, through downregulation of EZH2 expression level, along
with the reductions of MMP9, CD44, Sox2 and the induction of tumor suppressor
miR-143. Either EZH2 overexpression or miR-143 inhibition could partially reverse
honokiol-induced cell growth arrest and impaired clonogenicity. Importantly, it was
first revealed that EZH2 could directly bind to the transcriptional regulatory region of
miR-143 and repress its expression. Furthermore, honokiol treatment on T24 tumor
xenografts confirmed its anticancer effects in vivo, including suppression tumor
growth and tumor stemness, accompanied by the dysregulation of EZH2 and miR143 expressions. Our data suggest a promising therapeutic option to develop drugs
targeting EZH2/miR-143 axis, such as honokiol, for bladder cancer treatment.

INTRODUCTION

or chemotherapy is very limited. Therefore, UBC is one of
the most expensive malignancies, with the annual cost at 4
billion US$ for UBC in the USA per year [3, 4].
Recent studies revealed that a small population of
cancer stem cells (CSCs), which is enriched after therapy,
may account for chemotherapy failure [5-7]. These CSCs
have the ability to generate all types of differentiated cells
to repopulate tumors and eventually lead to metastasis;
they are thus regarded as the sustaining force of a tumor.

Urinary bladder cancer (UBC) is one of the most
common urogenital malignant tumors, with an estimated
74,690 new cases and 15,580 deaths occurring in USA
during 2014 [1]. Although localized bladder cancers can
be surgically resected, the recurrence and progression rates
are extremely high [2]. Moreover, the therapeutic response

The CSC-targeting therapeutic approach to prevent
tumor recurrence becomes a promising regimen for UBC
treatment.
Histone modification through polycomb repressive
complexes (PRCs) plays an essential role for normal and
malignant cell stemness maintenance [8, 9]. As a pivotal
component of PRC2, Enhancer of Zeste Homologue 2
(EZH2) has intrinsic histone methyltransferase activity for
histone H3K27. The increased trimethylation on H3K27
by EZH2 activation specifically represses the transcription
of differentiation-related genes throughout the cell
cycle to maintain the stemness of cells [10, 11]. EZH2
deregulation is frequently detected in a variety of cancer
types, including lung cancer, prostate cancer and UBC
[11-13], by regulating its multiple target genes involved
in carcinogenesis.
Recent studies revealed that microRNAs (miRNAs)
as a new class of regulators for tumor development.
miRNAs belong to the noncoding RNAs with
approximately 22 nucleotides, functioning as negative
regulators for gene expression at the post-transcriptional
level. Previous studies indicated that miR-101 enhanced
cytostatic drug sensitivity of liver cancer through targeting
EZH2 gene [14, 15]. In reverse, several tumor suppressor
miRNAs and proapoptotic miRNAs have been identified
as the direct targets of EZH2 [16, 17]. Exploring the
EZH2-miRNAs-associated signaling network in UBC
development and identification of new EZH2 inhibitors
may provide novel therapeutic strategies for UBC
treatment.
Honokiol is one of the lignans with high
bioavailability, which can be extracted from Magnolia
officinalis. It has been long to be used in traditional
Chinese medicine, showing multiple biological
activities, including anticancer, anti-inflammation,
and neuroprotective properties [18, 19]. However, the
molecular mechanism of anti-cancer effects of honokiol
on bladder cancer cells remains unclear.
In this study, we have determined the effects of
honokiol through the repression of oncoprotein EZH2 and
induction of tumor suppressor miR-143, on the UBC cell
proliferation, survival, cancer stemness maintenance and
cell migration in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, the novel
mechanism how EZH2 directly regulates miR-143 in UBC
cells has also been uncovered.

µg/ml were applied to UBC cells. After 72 h treatment,
cell viability was assessed by MTT assay showing that
honokiol reduced viable cell number in a dose-dependent
manner (Figure 1A and Supplementary Figure 1A). The
lowest honokiol concentrations for significant growth
inhibition of T24, 5637 and J82 cells are 4.8, 7.2 and 4.8
µg/ml, respectively. Since the cytotoxic effects are similar
among three UBC cell lines, we chose two commonly
used human UBC cell lines, T24 and 5637, for further
experiments. Colony formation assay was also performed
to test the long-term effects of honokiol. As shown in
Figure 1B, clonogenicities of T24 and 5637 cells were
dramatically decreased upon long-term honokiol treatment
with a concentration higher than 4.8 µg/ml.
CSC is an underlying cause of tumor recurrence
and metastasis, and it is becoming the primary target for
cancer treatment. Here, whether honokiol could inhibit the
stemness of UBC cells was investigated. ALDEFLUOR
assay was utilized to identify the stem/progenitor
cells based on the high expression level of aldehyde
dehydrogenase (ALDH) enzyme. The treatment of
honokiol for 24 h reduced the ALDHHigh cell population in
T24 (4.13%) and 5637 cells (3.39%), comparing with that
in the vehicle-treated T24 (8.34%) and 5637 (8.69%) cells
(Figure 1C and Supplementary Figure 2A). Consistently,
sphere formation capacity of T24 cells was also inhibited
by honokiol for 14 d treatment (Figure 1D). The number
of spheres in honokiol-treated cells (4.8 and 9.6 µg/ml)
was 64.4% and 88.9% less than that in vehicle-treated
cells, respectively.
Cell migration by wound healing assay and cell
invasion by Transwell assay were further performed.
Honokiol treatment in T24 and 5637 cells delayed wound
closure in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 1E and
Supplementary Figure 2B). In the presence of 4.8 µg/
ml honokiol, the invasive capacities of T24 and 5637
cells were also significantly decreased by 55.6% and
83.4%, compared to vehicle treatment. Such inhibitions
were enhanced at 9.6 µg/ml honokiol, i.e. 72.2%
reduction in T24 and 90.7% in 5637 cells (Figure 1F and
Supplementary Figure 2C).
To dissect the anticancer effects, we found honokiol
induced G1 arrest and the increase of Sub-G1 population
(apoptotic cells) in a concentration-dependent manner
(Supplementary Figure 3A). Western blotting assay
further revealed that cell proliferation protein (Cyclin
D1) was reduced and cell cycle inhibitors (p21 and p27)
were increased (Supplementary Figure 3B). In addition,
honokiol treatment reduced the expression level of
anti-apoptotic protein (Bcl2) and increased that of proapoptotic protein (BAX), accompanied by the cleavages
of PARP (Supplementary Figure 3C). Taken together,
these results demonstrated that honokiol inhibits the cell
proliferation, survival, stemness and invasion of bladder
cancer cells in vitro.

RESULTS
The anticancer effect of honokiol in vitro
The anticancer effect of honokiol on human bladder
cancer cells was investigated in three commonly used
human UBC cell lines, T24, 5637 and J82. Different
concentrations of honokiol ranging from 4.8 to 19.2

The anticancer effect of honokiol is through
repressing EZH2

27 (H3K27me3) in T24, 5637 and J82 cells (Figure 2A
and Supplementary Figure 1B). Besides, the reductions of
H3K4me3 and H3K79me2 were detected in either 5637
or T24 cells (Figure 2A). Taken together, honokiol can
reduce H3K27me3 level, independent on UBC cell lines.
EZH2 is the H3K27 methyltransferase, which is
overexpressed in various cancer types, including bladder
cancer. Therefore, we first confirmed that all 7 UBC cell
lines express EZH2, with relatively lower levels in T24 and
J82 cells and a higher level in 5637 cells (Supplementary

Since epigenetic modifications are involved in
cell survival, invasion, and stemness maintenance, we
examined the global changes in several histone marks
in honokiol-treated UBC cells. Among these histone
marks, we observed that honokiol selectively and
strikingly reduced the trimethylation of histone 3 lysine

Figure 1C). Honokiol decreased the expression level of
EZH2 protein in a dose-dependent manner in T24, J82 and
5637 cells, regardless of their different expression levels
of EZH2 (Figure 2B and Supplementary Figure 1B). The
decrease of EZH2 in T24 and 5637 cells was accompanied
by the reduction of MMP9 (invasion-associated marker),
and other stem cell markers (including CD44 and Sox2;
Figure 2B).
In order to test the role of EZH2 in bladder cancer
cells, we knocked down EZH2 by small interfering RNA
and found its depletion reduced cell proliferation by
33.9% and 27.9%, 72 h after siRNA transfection (Figure
2C and 2D). Consistently, colony formation capabilities
were also reduced by 52.6% and 36.5% in RNAi group,
compared to control siRNA group (Figure 2E). EZH2
ablation reduced trimethylated H3K27, Cyclin D1 and the
expression of stem cell markers (CD44 and Sox2) in T24

and 5637 cells, respectively (Figure 2C). A tumor sphere
model, in which the stem cells have the capability to form
the spheres under the suspension culture condition, was
then generated. Once the stem cells dissociate from the
spheres and re-attach the plates, they lose their stemness
and undergo differentiation. Using this model, we showed
EZH2 mRNA level increased 2.52 folds in T24 spheres,
compared to adherent T24 cells. Interestingly, EZH2
expression in re-attached cells reduced to comparable
level (1.10-fold) with the T24 cells under regular culture
condition. We further confirmed that the expression levels
of EZH2 and stem cell markers (CD44, Sox2, Aldh1a1,
Pou5f1, and Nanog) were also associated with the cell
differentiation status (Figure 2F and supplementary Figure
4). These data demonstrated EZH2 could regulate the cell
proliferation and stemness of bladder cancer cells in vitro.

The anticancer effect of honokiol is through
induction of miR-143

downregulated by 65.4% with honokiol treatment for 24
h (Figure 2G). On the other hand, ectopic expression of
EZH2 in T24 cells could partially reverse the honokiolinduced inhibitions of cell growth (Figure 2H) and
clonogenicity (Figure 2I). These findings indicate the
honokiol-induced anti-cancer effects are partially through
downregulation of EZH2 gene, a crucial regulator of cell
proliferation and stemness.

miRNAs have been implicated in various cellular
processes, including drug response. Therefore, we carried
out a small scale qRT-PCR screening in 22 cancerrelated miRNAs to identify the miRNAs responsible for
honokiol treatment. Honokiol at 9.6 µg/ml in T24 cells
induced 8 miRNAs upregulated (≥2.0-folds, Figure 3A).
Among them, miR-143 is the one with the highest change.

The upregulation of miR-143 upon honokiol treatment
was further verified in 5637 and J82 cells (Figure 3B
and Supplementary Figure 1D). As a negative control
miRNA, miR-1 was not significantly changed in both of
two cell lines (Supplementary Figure 5). miR-34a, whose
upregulation was reported very recently by honokiol in
breast cancer cells [20], was used as a positive control
miRNA. Up-regulation of miR-34a upon honokiol
treatment was also identified in both UBC cell lines, T24
and 5637 (Supplementary Figure 5).
In order to test whether miR-143 is essential for
bladder cancer cell proliferation and stemness, miRNA
mimic for miR-143 (mimic miR-143) was transiently
transfected into T24 and 5637 cells. Mimic miR-143
significantly inhibited UBC cell proliferation (Figure 3C)
and clonogenicity (Figure 3D). Consistently, mimic miR-

143 reduced Cyclin D1 protein level, compared to control
group (Figure 3E). In addition, the protein levels of CSC
markers, such as CD44 and Sox2, were also decreased
with the miR-143 mimic transfection (Figure 3E).
Whether miR-143 is required for honokiol-induced
anti-cancer effects was studied using the miRNA inhibitor
for miR-143 (miR-143 inhibitor. A random sequence
anti-miR molecule with an undetectable effect on known
miRNA function was used as an anti-miR negative control
(NC). Under 9.6 µg/ml honokiol treatment, miR-143
inhibitor could partially restore the honokiol-induced
cell growth arrest (Figure 3F) and reduction of colony
number (Figure 3G) in T24 cells. Hence, these data
reveal that miR-143 overexpression, induced by honokiol
treatment, could suppress cell proliferation and stemness
maintenance.

EZH2 directly binds to miR-143 promoter to
repress its expression

comparing to the anti-miR negative control (CTRL
inhibitor) under the same condition of EZH2 knockdown.
In addition, the inhibition of miR-143 could re-induce
the CD44 expression, which was suppressed by EZH2
knockdown in T24 and 5637 cells (Figure 5D). Altogether,
honokiol down-regulates EZH2 expression, gets rid of
the repressive H3K27me3 mark and induces miR-143
expression in human UBC cells.

Whether miR-143 is the downstream target of EZH2
gene was investigated. It was found that knockdown
EZH2 by siRNA in T24 and 5637 cells induced miR-143
expression greatly (Figure 4A and 4B); whereas ectopic
expression of EZH2 in T24 cells significantly reduced
miR-143 expression (Figure 4C and 4D). Furthermore,
EZH2 overexpression represses the promoter activity
of miR-143 by luciferase assay (Figure 4E). We then
examined if honokiol regulates miR-143 expression
through EZH2. Upon honokiol treatment, the decrease
of EZH2 recruitment was detected in the promoter
region (region 1), but not the downstream region (region
2, negative control; Figure 4F and 4G). Consistently,
honokiol treatment only diminished the H3K27me3
level in region 1 on the promoter (Figure 4H). As shown
in Figure 5A, ectopically expression of EZH2 into T24
cells significantly reversed the induction of miR-143 by
honokiol. To further test whether miR-143 depletion can
rescue cell growth arrest induced by EZH2 knockdown,
we exploited miR-143 inhibitor to block miR-143 activity.
In T24 and 5637 cells, miR-143 inhibitor increased the
cell proliferation in MTT assay (Figure 5B) and elevated
colony forming numbers (Figure 5C), respectively,

Honokiol inhibits T24 tumor growth in nude mice
In order to evaluate the role of honokiol on tumor
growth in vivo, T24 subcutaneous xenografts were
generated in nude mice. When tumors became palpable,
tumor-bearing animals were randomly divided into three
groups for low-dose (40 mg/kg), high-dose (80 mg/kg)
honokiol and vehicle treatments. Tumor size and animal
body weight were measured every week for 5 weeks.
Longitudinal studies of tumor volume and body weight
in each cohort (n ≥ 4) were plotted over time. The tumor
progression of high-dose honokiol group was significantly
lower than that of vehicle group (Figure 6A and 6B, P <
0.001). There was no observed toxicity, for example, no
significant body weight change (Figure 6C), even from the
high-dose honokiol treatment in this study. Subcutaneous
tumors with high-dose honokiol treatment were greatly

smaller than control tumors. Average tumor weight at
the endpoint in high-dose honokiol group (0.255 ± 0.174
g) was 28.8% of that in vehicle group (0.885 ± 0.232 g;
Figure 6D, P < 0.05). The tumor proliferation rate was
assessed by IHC staining for Ki-67. Ki-67-positive index
was strikingly reduced in high-dose honokiol tumors
comparing to the vehicle group (Figure 6E). Honokiolinduced upregulation of miR-143 was also observed
(Figure 6F), consistent with the downregulation of EZH2
gene (Figure 6G and 6H). Protein levels of other stem cell
markers, CD44 and Sox2, were also decreased in the T24
xenografts with honokiol treatment (Figure 6G and 6H).

overexpression is associated with cancer cell proliferation,
cancer cell stemness and metastasis. For example, the
elevated expression level of EZH2 is a common event
in UBC samples, and correlates with aggressiveness and
invasion of bladder tumors [22, 23]. In addition, EZH2
is also involved in the progression of prostate and breast
cancer, which can serve as a marker of aggressive cancer
types to predict clinical outcome [24]. Transgenic EZH2
promotes mammary tumor initiation of tumor virusneu mice, through increasing the CSC population [25].
Additionally, EZH2 expression is required for pancreatic
and breast cancer stem cell maintenance [26]. Hence,
EZH2 is a promising therapeutic target for cancer. Our
study demonstrated that EZH2 expression is enriched
in the UBC stem cell population. Three UBC cell lines
with various EZH2 expression levels show well response
to honokiol treatment, suggesting that anti-cancer effects
of honokiol is more general in UBC cells. Depletion
of EZH2 by RNA interfering or honokiol treatment
inhibited cell proliferation and clonogenicity. Of note,
honokiol treatment significantly decreased tumor growth
in vivo by downregulation of EZH2 expression and other
aggressiveness related protein levels.
Since honokiol inhibits EZH2 at both mRNA
and protein levels, such inhibition might be through
transcription regulation. Recently, a couple of transcription
factors and lncRNAs, such as NF-YA, hMOF and lncRNASox2ot, have been implicated in EZH2 overexpression in
ovarian, oral tongue squamous cell carcinoma and lung
cancer [27-29]. How honokiol regulates EZH2 requires

DISCUSSION
In this study, we are the first to report that honokiol
suppresses EZH2/miR-143 axis to inhibit UBC cell
proliferation, invasion, and stemness. The concentration
of apoptosis induction effect of honokiol in our study
is close to previous study using 50 µM honokiol (~13.3
µg/ml) in T24 cells under different culture condition
(0.5% serum) for 24 h [21]. In addition, we expanded
the study to another two UBC cell lines, and found the
anticancer effects of honokiol on UBC cells are general
effect. Notably, our in vivo data implied that honokiol
is a potential therapeutic agent for treating UBCs, with
relatively minimal toxicity to the animals.
EZH2, a major histone methyltransferase in
PRC2 complex, has been implicated in various cancer
types, including prostate, lung and bladder cancer. Its

further investigation. Since ectopically expression of
EZH2 in honokiol treated UBC cells can reverse the
decreases of cell viability, colony formation capacity by
honokiol, it suggests that EZH2 inhibition by honokiol
is not a non-specific consequence of cell growth arrest.
Overall, these data have demonstrated that inhibition of
EZH2 by honokiol in UBC cells can suppress cancer cell
growth and inhibit tumorigenicity.
The miRNAs play essential roles in various
biological processes, including cell proliferation, survival,
and differentiation. Downregulation of miR-143 was
detected in many cancer types, including UBC [30-33].
In chronic ulcerative colitis, with high risk for neoplastic
transformation, miR-143 was significantly increased,
suggesting that loss of miR-143 might be an early event
during colon cancer development [34]. Besides, the
decrease of miR-143 expression in cancer cells induces
cancer cell proliferation, migration, and chemoresistance
[35-37]. Moreover, miR-143 has been reported to inhibit
cancer cells stemness in glioblastoma stem-like cells
and prostate cancer cells [38, 39]. Several genes, such
as CD44, KLF5, K-Ras and hexokinase 2, have been
confirmed as the direct targets of miR-143 in cancer cells
[35,40,41]. Pagliuca A et al, has confirmed that miR-143
can reduced the expression level of CD44 (one stemness
marker) through targeting CD44 3’UTR [35]. Altogether,
it suggests that ectopic restoration of miR-143 mimic
might be a promising approach for cancer treatment.
Multiple lines of evidence suggested that there
is a complicated regulatory network controlled by the
oncoprotein EZH2. EZH2 is directly recruited to target
gene promoters and represses their transcriptions. These
target genes include E-Cadherin, TIMP-3, and Slit2,
which are responsible for cancer cell proliferation and
invasion [42-44]. Recent studies revealed that microRNAs
also play essential roles in cancer development, through
targeting the 3’UTR of mRNAs. Only a small number
of miRNAs, such as miR-200b, miR-200c and miR31, have been found as the targets of EZH2 in cancer
cells [16, 17]. Our data, for the first time, demonstrate
that miR-143 is one of the direct targets of EZH2 in
UBC cells. Transcriptional regulation mechanism of
miR-143 has not been well-defined. Previous reports
showed that DNA methyltransferase 3B may account for
epigenetic regulation on the expression of miR-143 in
endometrioid carcinomas [45]. In this study, we proved
that EZH2 directly bound to the miR-143 promoter,
modified the trimethylation status of histone H3K27 and
repress the miR-143 transcription. Further functional
analysis indicated that EZH2/miR-143 axis could confer
accelerated cell proliferation and increased cell stemness
in UBC cells both in vitro and in vivo.
The anticancer effects of honokiol might be through
multiple pathways. Based on our findings, re-introduction
of EZH2 or miR-143 inhibitor did not fully rescue
honokiol-induced cell viability and colony formation
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

capacities. These data implied that there must have some
other regulators invovled in honokiol-induced cytotoxic
effects. Recent studies showed that honokiol can target
EGFR, AMPK, Notch signalings in various cancer cells;
further supporting the idea that honokiol can regulate
multiple pathways to inhibit cancer cells.
Taken together, our study suggested that honokiol
could be a promising candidate for chemoprevention and/
or therapeutic treatment. The inhibitory effect of honokiol
on UBC cells may function through suppression of EZH2
function and induction of its target, miR-143.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The animal protocol was approved by the
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC),
Model Animal Research Center of Nanjing University.
Honokiol (HonoPure®, EcoNugenics, Santa Rosa, CA,
USA) was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and
further diluted in sterile culture medium immediately
prior to use. The final concentration of DMSO was less
than 0.05%. Antibodies against H3K4me3, H3K9me3,
H3K27me3, H3K79me3, H4K20me1, H4K20me2,
Histone 3, Cyclin D1, CD44, EZH2, H3K27me3, p21,

purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO, USA).

Cell culture
Human bladder cancer cell lines T24, 5637, J82,
RT4, UMUC3, SW780, and BIU87 were obtained from the
Cell Bank of Type Culture Collection, Chinese Academy
of Science (Shanghai, China). Both cell lines were
maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies),
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Hyclone
Laboratories, South Logan, UT, USA). Cell lines were
incubated at 37oC in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95%
air.

Cell proliferation assay
MTT
(3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay was performed to
assess cell survival and growth. 1,500 cells/well were
seeded to the 96-well plate in triplicate. Honokiol at
various concentrations (4.8 μg/ml - 19.2 μg/ml) were

added 24 h later. 3 days post treatment, cells were washed
with PBS and MTT (5 mg/ml) was then added for 3 h at
37°C. 100 μl DMSO was loaded for each well to dissolve
formazan crystals. Plates were shaken at room temperature
for 15 min. Absorbance at 490 nm was examined using
a microplate reader (BioTek Instruments, Winooski, VT,
USA).

The mixture of Matrigel (BD Biosciences, San Jose,
CA, USA) and serum free cell culture medium (1:10)
was added to upper chamber of 24-well transwell plates,
incubated at 37oC 4 h for gelling, and kept at 4oC for 24
h. RPMI 1640 culture medium plus 10% FBS (500 μl/
well) was added to the bottom well. 4×104 cells in 100
μl were then seeded in the upper chamber with 8 μm
pore membrane and incubated in honokiol at different
concentration (4.8 μg/ml - 19.2 μg/ml) for 16 h. The cells
on the membrane were fixed with 4% PFA for 10 min,
stained with 0.1% crystal violet for 5 min and counted.

Colony formation assay
500 cells per well were plated in 6-well plates. Two
days later, different concentrations of honokiol (4.8 μg/
ml - 19.2 μg/ml) were applied to UBC cells for 14 days.
Cells were fixed with 100% methanol, washed with PBS
and stained with 0.1% crystal violet. Only colonies with
>50 cells were counted.

Protein extraction and western blot analysis
Cells were lysed by ice-cold modified RIPA
buffer. 20 µg of protein was resolved on SDS-PAGE gel,
transferred to PVDF membrane (Millipore, Billerica, MA,
USA). Primary antibodies against H3K4me3, H3K9me3,
H3K27me3, H3K79me3, H4K20me1, H4K20me2,
Histone 3, Cyclin D1, CD44, EZH2, MMP9, and Sox2
were used. β-Actin was used as a loading control.
Chemiluminescence was achieved using the ECL Western
Blotting Detection Reagents (Amersham Pharmacia
Biotech, Arlington Heights, IL, USA).

Flow cytometry analysis
Cells were incubated with indicated concentrations
of Honokiol for 48 h, before samples were fixed by 70%
ethanol. Cells were incubated in 10 mg/ml RNase A
containing PBS for 30 min at 37°C, followed by addition
of 1 mg/ml propidium iodine (PI; Sigma). Afterwards cells
were analyzed using a fluorescence-activated cell sorting
(FACS) Calibur flow cytometer (BD FACS Calibur, BD
Biosciences, San Jose, CA).

ALDEFLUOR assay

Sphere formation assay

The ALDH enzyme activity was detected by the
ALDEFLUOER kit (Stem Cell Technologies, Vancouver,
Canada), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. 5
µl of activated ALDEFLUOER reagent was added to 1 ml
single cell suspension and incubated at 37oC for 40 min.
An ALDH-specific inhibitor, Diethylaminobenzaldehyde
(DEAB), was applied prior to staining as a negative
control. Cells were analyzed on a BD FACScan flow
cytometer (BD Biosciences).

T24 and 5637 cells were trypsinized by TrypLE
(Life Technologies Corp., Grand Island, NY, USA) and
washed by PBS. 1.0×105 cells per well were seeded in
the 6-well ultra-low attachment plates (Corning, Steuben
County, NY, USA) in DMEM/F-12 culture medium
supplemented with 10 ng/ml human recombinant bFGF
and 10 ng/ml EGF (PeproTech, Rocky Hill, NJ, USA).
After culture for 14 days with or without honokiol, spheres
were photographed. Spheres with the diameter greater than
50 µm were counted.

RNA isolation and quantitative RT-PCR (qRTPCR)

Wound healing assay

Total RNA was extracted with TRIzol Reagent,
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Small
RNA (≤ 200 nucleotides) was extracted from tissue and
cells by using mirVana miRNA isolation kit (Ambion),
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Small
RNA polyadenylation were performed according to the
protocol as previously described [46]. Real-time PCR
was performed in 384-well plates using SYBR Premix
Ex TaqTM II kit (TaKaRa, Dalian, China) and measured by
ABI 7900HT (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA, USA).
U6 (RNU6B) snRNA and β-actin (ACTB) mRNA were
used as references for miRNA and mRNA, respectively.

Wound healing assay was used to assess the capacity
of cell migration and invasion. Briefly, when the cells
reached 90-95% confluence, the wound was generated by
scratching the surface of the plates with a pipette tip. After
removal of floating cells, adherent cells were incubated
in various concentrations (4.8~19.2 μg/ml) of honokiol or
vehicle for 24 to 36 h till the wound was healed. The gap
distances at different time points were normalized by the
one immediately after scratching.

In vivo tumor xenograft study

The primer sequences for qRT-PCR were listed in
Supplementary Table S1.

2.5 × 106 T24 cells in 0.1 ml 50% Matrigel were
injected subcutaneously into the right flank of 4- to
6-week-old male athymic nude mice. 10 days after cell
inoculation, the animals with palpable tumors were
randomly divided into three experimental groups with
intraperitoneal injections every other day for 5 weeks: (1)
low dose honokiol, 40 mg/kg in 20% Intralipid; (2) high
dose honokiol, 80 mg/kg in 20% Intralipid; and (3) vehicle
control, 20% Intralipid. Tumor volume was calculated
by the formula tumor volume [mm3] = (length [mm]) ×
(width [mm])2/2. At the endpoint, tumors were weighed
and processed for further histological analysis.

Plasmid construction
To clone miR143-promoter, we amplified
754-base

promoter
region
from
human genomic DNA by PCR using forward
primer:
5’-CGGGGTACCGCAAAAGGAG
AAAGAGGGACT-3’;
reverse
primer:
5’-CCCAAGCTTGAAGAGGCAAGCCCCGTATT-3’.
And then we cloned the sequence into pGL3-basic
(Promega) at KpnI and HindIII.

Transfection

Immunohistochemistry (IHC)

UBC cells were plated in 6 cm dish
overnight, transfected with 20 μM of EZH2 siRNA
(5’-GUGUAUGAGUUUAGAGUCAtt-3’) or scramble
control siRNA (5’-UUCUCCGAACGUGUCACGUtt-3’),
miR-143 mimic and miR-143 inhibitor (RIBOBIO,
Guangzhou, China) by Lipofectamine 2000 (Life
Technologies) for 48 h. For forced expression of EZH2,
pcDNA3-EZH2 and empty vector (pcDNA3) were
transfected into UBC cells by Lipofectamine 2000,
respectively.

5 µm-thick paraffin sections were for IHC staining.
The primary antibodies against CD44 (Cell Signaling,
#3570, 1:200) and Ki67 (Vector Laboratories, VP-RM04,
1:300) were incubated overnight at 4oC, respectively.
Secondary antibody conjugated with horseradish
peroxidase (HRP, KIT-9701, Maxim Biotechnologies,
China) was then incubated for 1 h at room temperature.
The slides were developed with the NovaRED substrate
kit (Vector Laboratories, SK-4800) and counterstained
by hematoxylin. A score was assigned to represent the
estimated percentage of positively stained carcinoma cells
as follows: 0: none, 1: ≤50%, 2: 50-75%, and 3: ≥75%.
An intensity score was assigned to represent the average
estimated intensity of staining in positive carcinoma cells
as follows: 0: none, 1: weak, 2: intermediate, 3: strong.
The proportion score and intensity score were multiplied
to obtain a total score ranging from 0 to 9.

Luciferase assay
Luciferase assays were performed using a luciferase
assay kit (Promega) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Briefly, in 24-well plates T24 cells were
transfected with pGL3-miR143-promoter plasmid with
p3XFlag-CMV10 control vector (control group) and
p3XFlag-CMV10-EZH2 (experiment group), respectively.
The cells were harvested and lyzed for luciferase assay
48h after transfection. Renilla luciferase was used for
normalization.

Statistical analysis
Each experiment was repeated three times. The
mean values with standard deviations from the triplicates
were plotted. The significant difference between control
and experimental groups was analyzed using t-test (* P <
0.05; ** P < 0.01; *** P < 0.001).

Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay
ChIP Assay Kit (Millipore) was used to study
the protein-DNA interaction in cells. Briefly, cross-

linked DNAs were isolated from 5 10 cells, followed
by sonication into 300-1,000 bp in length. ChIP-grade
antibodies against EZH2 (Cat# 5246, Cell Signaling)
and trimethyl-H3K27 (Cat# 9733, Cell Signaling) were
applied, respectively. Normal rabbit IgG antibody was
used as a negative control. The sequences of primers used
for qPCR analysis of the miR-143 promoter were listed in
Supplementary Table S1.
