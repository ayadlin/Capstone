BACKGROUND. Two recent chemoprevention trials demonstrated significant reductions in overall prostate cancer incidence. However,
a possible increase in high-grade disease has raised concerns that the harms of the drugs, including mortality because of high-grade
disease, may outweigh the benefits. The authors attempted to estimate the effect of these drugs on prostate cancer mortality to be
able to better evaluate the cost-benefit tradeoff. METHODS. The authors analyzed prostate cancer incidence in the Prostate Cancer
Prevention Trial (PCPT) and Reduction by Dutasteride of Prostate Cancer Events (REDUCE) trial, which evaluated finasteride and the
related compound dutasteride, respectively (both vs placebo). They used 13-year prostate cancer survival data from the Prostate,
Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian (PLCO) trial to project prostate cancer mortality from incidence patterns; survival rates were applied to
incident cancers according to prognostic strata, which were defined by Gleason score, prostate-specific antigen level, and clinical
stage. For PCPT, the analysis was performed using both original trial results and previously published adjusted analyses that
attempted to account for artifacts related to the drugsâ€™ effect on prostate volume. RESULTS. For the PCPT trial, the estimated relative
risk (RR) for prostate cancer mortality was 1.02 (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.85-1.23) using the original trial results and 0.87
(95% CI, 0.72-1.06) and 0.91 (95% CI, 0.76-1.09) based on the adjusted PCPT analyses. For the REDUCE trial, the RR for prostate cancer mortality was 0.93 (95% CI, 0.80-1.08). CONCLUSIONS. Projecting a mortality outcome of the PCPT and REDUCE trials as an
approach to weighing benefits versus harms suggests at most a small increase in prostate cancer mortality in the treatment arms,

INTRODUCTION
Chemoprevention is one approach to lessening the burden of prostate cancer. In 2003, the Prostate Cancer Prevention
Trial (PCPT) reported a 25% reduction in prostate cancer period prevalence associated with the 5a-reductase inhibitor
finasteride compared with placebo in men with baseline prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels < 3 ng/mL.1 In 2009, the
Reduction by Dutasteride of Prostate Cancer Events (REDUCE) trial, which compared the related 5a-reductase inhibitor
dutasteride against placebo in men with a PSA > 3 ng/mL and a prior negative biopsy reported a 23% reduction in overall
prostate cancer period prevalence.2
However, the results of the PCPT and REDUCE trials raised concerns regarding high-grade disease; in both trials,
an increase was observed in the incidence of Gleason score 8 to 10 disease in the active drug treatment arm.1,2 Although
the increase was not found to be statistically significant in either study, the numbers of Gleason score 8 to 10 cases were
small and there was relatively little power to identify a significant difference. The biological plausibility of the increase in
high-grade disease has been debated, with some evidence of a possible mechanism.3,4 Recently, a US Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) panel voted overwhelmingly against the approval of both finasteride and dutasteride for a cancer
prevention indication.5 The primary reason for the disapproval was the apparent increase in the incidence of Gleason score
8 to 10 tumors in the patients in the active drug arm that was observed in the 2 trials.
At the FDA panel, and elsewhere, the question arose as how to balance a clear decrease in Gleason score 2 to 6 disease, and possibly Gleason score 7 disease, with a possible increase in Gleason score 8 to 10 disease. The absolute number
of Gleason score 2 to 6 tumors prevented by the drugs overwhelms the observed absolute number of additional Gleason
score 8 to 10 tumors, because Gleason score 2 to 6 disease is so much more common. However, Gleason score 8 to 10 disease has a considerably worse prognosis than Gleason score 2 to 6 (or even 7) disease, and therefore it is not clear how the
trade-off would be evaluated. Furthermore, especially in the PCPT, in which many of the Gleason score 2 to 6 tumors

were diagnosed only on mandated end-of-study biopsy
performed in men with low PSA levels, the clinical significance of these tumors has been questioned.5
One common metric that could be used to assess the
benefits and harms of an increase in one type of prostate
cancer versus a decrease in another is disease-specific mortality. Specifically, one could project from the incidence
results, using appropriate survival statistics, the prostate
cancer-specific mortality rate over an extended period of
follow-up for the drug and placebo arms (note that neither the REDUCE nor PCPT trial planned for an
extended mortality follow-up). This approach would
effectively weight each cancer according to its risk of disease-related death and use prostate cancer mortality as the
common metric with which to compare the risks and benefits of the drugs. The recently published US Preventive
Services Task Force recommendation statement regarding
screening for prostate cancer, which recommended
against such screening, suggested, under its discussion of
research needs and gaps, that more study was needed to
determine the effect of 5a-reductase inhibitors on the
mortality from prostate cancer.6 This exercise then comprises a modeling-based component of such research.
Several prior analyses have attempted to estimate the
survival benefit associated with finasteride by applying prostate survival statistics to observed prostate cancer incidence
rates in the PCPT trial.7-9 These analyses all used survival
rates obtained either from cohorts of men with symptomatically detected disease or from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database, which represents a
mixture of screen-detected and symptomatically detected disease. However, because of frequent PSA screening and routine scheduled (by protocol) biopsies in both the PCPT and
REDUCE trials, the cancers diagnosed in these trials were
overwhelmingly detected in the absence of symptoms.
Because of lead time and overdiagnosis, which are both substantial in prostate cancer, survival rates would be expected to
be substantially higher in screen-detected cases than in symptomatically detected cases, even if screening had no effect on
prostate cancer mortality.10 Therefore, to estimate the mortality effect in these 2 chemoprevention trials as accurately as
possible, we used survival rates obtained from the intervention arm of the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian
(PLCO) cancer screening trial, in which men were receiving
annual screening with PSA.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
PCPT Trial

The PCPT trial randomized 9423 men to treatment with
finasteride (at a dose of 5 mg/day) and 9459 men to pla594

cebo.1 Eligibility criteria included a baseline PSA level 
3.0 ng/mL. Subjects were treated and followed over a 7year period, during which they were monitored for compliance and screened annually with PSA and digital rectal
examination (DRE). Subjects with an elevated PSA or suspicious DRE were referred for biopsy. In addition, all subjects without a cancer diagnosis at the end of the study
were asked to return for an end-of-study biopsy. All biopsies were reviewed centrally by pathologists blinded to the
study arm. Among men with at least 1 biopsy, a 25%
reduction in prostate cancer period prevalence was
reported for men in the finasteride treatment arm compared with the placebo arm.
An issue in the PCPT trial was a possible bias in cancer detection and Gleason grading on biopsy because of
the effect of finasteride in shrinking the prostate gland.
Several research groups attempted to correct for this bias
using various approaches, including extrapolating the
Gleason scoring from the subset of cases with radical prostatectomy and correcting for differences in prostate volume across treatment arms.11-13 The mortality projection
was performed in multiple ways for the PCPT trial, using
both the observed (biopsy) Gleason scoring and adjusted
scoring.
REDUCE Trial

The REDUCE trial tested dutasteride at a dose of 0.5 mg/
day against placebo for prostate cancer chemoprevention.2
Eligibility criteria included a baseline PSA of 3.0 ng/mL
to 10 ng/mL (2.5-10 ng/mL for men aged < 60 years)
and a history of a single negative biopsy. Subjects were
treated and followed for 4 years and received PSA tests every 6 months. Biopsies were performed at year 2 and year
4 or for cause. All positive biopsies were reviewed centrally
by a pathologist who was blinded to the treatment arm. A
total of 8231 men were enrolled in the trial. Among men
who underwent prostate biopsy in years 1 to 4, an overall
reduction of 20% in the prostate cancer period prevalence
was observed for the dutasteride treatment arm compared
with the placebo arm.
PLCO Trial

The PLCO trial is a multicenter, randomized controlled
trial designed to test the efficacy of screening for 4 types of
cancer in persons aged 55 years to 74 years at baseline.1416
The methods have been described elsewhere. Briefly,
randomization to a screened or control arm took place
between 1993 and 2001, with 154,900 persons (and
76,685 men) enrolled at 10 centers. Men in the screening
arm received PSA and DRE at baseline (year 0) and then
annually through year 3, and received PSA only at years 4

and 5. Exclusion criteria included history of a PLCO cancer; removal of the entire prostate; and, beginning in
1995, having undergone > 1 PSA blood test within the
past 3 years. A PSA result of > 4 ng/mL was considered to
be positive. Prostate cancer cases and deaths were ascertained through routine follow-up of positive screens and
through the use of an annual study update questionnaire
supplemented with National Death Index searches. Certified tumor registrars at each screening center abstracted,
using a standardized protocol, clinical and pathologic (if
available) T, N, and M classification characteristics, biopsy Gleason score, and Gleason score from radical prostatectomy (if performed). There was no centralized
pathology review of Gleason scoring.
The major characteristics of all 3 trials are summarized in Table 1.
Statistical Methods

To estimate mortality from prostate cancer from the chemoprevention trial data, we simulated a mortality endpoint trial by â€˜â€˜virtuallyâ€™â€™ following up all diagnosed
prostate cancer cases. Because there are 13 available years
of PLCO survival data, to use all that survival information, we virtually followed subjects with prostate cancer
for 13 years from diagnosis. However, because subjects
were diagnosed at different study times, this necessitates
that (virtual) follow-up time from enrollment varied
across cases. Cases diagnosed at the latest time in the
PCPT, year 7, were followed for 20 years from enrollment
whereas those diagnosed earlier, at year â€˜â€˜n,â€™â€™ were followed
for only n Ã¾13 years, and were effectively â€˜â€˜censoredâ€™â€™ for
the last (7-n) years of a virtual 20-year mortality trial.
However, this virtual censoring should not bias the
results, because the time of diagnosis was similar across
treatment arms in both the PCPT and REDUCE trials. In
the PCPT trial, 23% of cancers in the finasteride treatCancer

ment arm were diagnosed through year 3 and 46% were
diagnosed at end of study biopsy; the corresponding percentages for the placebo arm were 23% and 50%, respectively. In the REDUCE trial, 66% of cancers in the
dutasteride arm versus 68% of cancer in the placebo arm
were diagnosed at study years 1 through 2. Thus, virtual
censoring was approximately equal across arms for both
trials.
We divided prostate cancer cases into prognostic
strata, and for each stratum computed expected deaths as
the number of cases times 1 minus the appropriate survival rate, in which the latter was the 13-year prostate-specific survival rate in the corresponding stratum among
PLCO cases in the intervention arm as computed using
the Kaplan-Meier method. For each stratum, the same
survival rate applied for each trial arm. We did not
account for other-cause mortality, because it would be
expected to be similar for each arm. Total expected deaths
were calculated by summing up expected deaths over all
prognostic categories, with death rates defined as expected
deaths over total subjects with incidence endpoint data
(ie, with biopsy). The relative risk (RR) for mortality was
computed as the ratio of expected death rates.
For the PCPT trial, because the majority of Gleason
score 2 to 6 cancers were diagnosed at the time of the endof-study biopsy (ie, not for cause) and were generally low
risk, we stratified these further according to PSA level (
4 ng/mL, > 4 ng/mL) and T classification (T1a-T1c,
T2a-T2c) for clinically localized cancers, and by TNM
stage (stage III, stage IV) for nonclinically localized cancers. Because finasteride reduces PSA levels, for the drug
arm we used the same adjustments to PSA as were used in
the PCPT trial to determine for-cause biopsy (ie, multiplying measured PSA by a factor of 2.0 through year 3
and by a factor of 2.3 afterward).1 Gleason score 7 and
595

Original Article

score 8 to 10 cancers were stratified according to TNM
stage (I/II, III, and IV); for stages III and IV, because of
small numbers, cases in the control and intervention arms
of the PLCO trial combined were used to derive survival
rates. In addition, for stage IV, Gleason score 2 to 6 and
Gleason score 7 cases were grouped together.
In addition to the standard (â€˜â€˜unadjustedâ€™â€™) analysis
of PCPT data, we performed 2 â€˜â€˜adjustedâ€™â€™ analyses based
on adjustments for the biopsy grading artifact mentioned
earlier. The first adjusted analysis is based on the method
of Pinsky et al, which involved extrapolating radical prostatectomy (RP) Gleason results to all cases; the second is
based on the analysis of Cohen et al, which modeled Gleason score-specific risk corrected for differences in volume
and the number of biopsy cores across treatment
arms.12,13
For the first adjusted analysis, the method derived
Gleason category-specific misclassification probabilities
of biopsy grading that were differential by arm; applying
these produced the adjusted RRs for each Gleason category reported by Pinsky et al.12 For the current analysis,
we applied these misclassification probabilities assuming
that they were independent of PSA and clinical stage. This
produced adjusted counts of cases in each Gleason category, with the categories stratified similarly as described
earlier by PSA and clinical stage.
For the second adjusted analysis, the reported odds
ratios (ORs) from Cohen et al were converted to revised
counts by Gleason category in the placebo arm; counts in
the finasteride arm were assumed unchanged.13 This
(prostate volume-adjusted) method, unlike the RP extrapolation method, changes not only the Gleason distribution of cases but also the total number of cases, because
more cancers are likely to be missed in the placebo arm
because of larger volume. As noted earlier, conversions of
Gleason category were assumed independent of PSA and
clinical stage; in addition, all additional placebo arm Gleason score 2 to 6 cancers were assumed to be of the lowest
risk (PSA < 4 ng/mL and T1a-T1c classification).
Unlike the PCPT, we did not have the access to the
raw data in the REDUCE trial, and therefore we were
only able to use as strata the reported Gleason categories
(scores 2-6, 7, and 8-10). Note that the majority of men
in the REDUCE trial had a PSA > 4 ng/mL (mean
baseline PSA, 5.9; standard deviation, 1.9) so it is not as
critical to stratify by PSA (or T classification).
A bootstrapping approach was used to calculate
95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) on the RR for mortality. Specifically, we performed bootstrapping with
replacement (n Â¼ 1000 runs) to randomly generate repli596

cate trial data sets and then applied the process described
earlier to each replicate, including necessary modifications
for the adjusted PCPT analyses. Variability in the PLCOderived survival rates was accounted for by sampling from
the distribution of survival rate estimates, which were
assumed to be normal with the standard error as computed from the Kaplan-Meier analysis.
RESULTS
Table 2 summarizes the findings of the PCPT and
REDUCE trials with respect to prostate cancer period
prevalence by treatment arm and Gleason score.5,12,13 For
the PCPT trial, the data for the observed (biopsy) Gleason
categories are shown as well as the results of the adjusted
analyses. For cases in the PCPT trial with a Gleason score
of 7, the period prevalence RR was slightly above 1 (1.08)
in the unadjusted and below 1 (RR, 0.79 and 0.89, respectively) in the adjusted analyses. RRs were below 1 for
Gleason score 2 to 6 cases (range, 0.47-0.64) and above 1
for Gleason score 8 to 10 cases (range, 1.44-1.61) in all
the PCPT analyses. In the REDUCE trial, period prevalence RRs were lower than 1 for Gleason score 2 to 6 cases
(RR, 0.73) and Gleason score 7 cases (RR, 0.92), and
greater than 1 (RR, 1.60) for Gleason score 8 to 10 cases.
Table 3 shows 1-survival rate estimates (and standard errors) at 13 years derived from the PLCO cohort for
different prognostic strata. These rates were used to compute the mortality projections for the 2 trials.
Table 4 displays the results of the projected mortality analysis. For unadjusted analysis in the PCPT trial,
expected death rates were similar in each treatment arm
(14.6 [finasteride] and 14.2 [placebo] per 1000 men; RR,
1.02 [95% CI, 0.85-1.23]). The death rate due to Gleason
score 2 to 6 tumors was greater in the placebo arm,
whereas the death rate due to Gleason score 8 to 10
tumors was greater in the finasteride arm. The adjusted
analyses showed RRs of 0.87 (95% CI, 0.72-1.06) and
0.91 (95% CI, 0.76-1.09) for the RP Gleason score and
prostate volume methods, respectively. In the RP Gleason-adjusted analysis, the death rate differential (finasteride vs placebo) for Gleason score 7 disease was 2.0 (8.6
vs 10.6), compared with 0.2 (5.4 vs 5.2) in the unadjusted
analysis; the differential also decreased for Gleason score 8
to 10 cases (from 2.1 to 1.2). In the prostate volumeadjusted analysis, the death rate differential also decreased
for Gleason score 7 disease (compared with the adjusted
analysis). In this (volume) analysis, deaths rates for Gleason score 7 to 10 disease were essentially equal, reflecting
the adjusted RR of 1.03 for Gleason score 7 to 10 disease,
with minor adjustments for small clinical stage differences

to 10 cases in the dutasteride arm, but lower for the Gleason score 2 to 6 and the Gleason score 7 cases.
DISCUSSION
Similar to most chemoprevention trials, neither the
PCPT nor the REDUCE trial had a cancer mortality endpoint, but rather an incidence endpoint. For a slow-growing tumor such as prostate cancer, the length of follow-up
required for a mortality endpoint would be considerable,
on the order of 15 years to 20 years, making such trials
logistically prohibitive under most circumstances. For the
PCPT and REDUCE trials, even if the cohorts were followed for a long period, as this analysis has done in a virtual manner, the sample size was still too small to have
adequate power with a reasonable hypothesized mortality
598

reduction. Based on the current analyses, assuming a true
mortality reduction of 15% and 15 years to 20 years of
follow-up from randomization, the power of the study
would only be within the range of 20% to 30%.
Realistically, chemoprevention trials with a mortality endpoint are therefore unlikely to be performed for
prostate cancer and we are left with using cancer incidence
as a surrogate endpoint. However, with this surrogate
endpoint unclear in these trials, due to a possible increase
in high-grade cancer along with an overall incidence
decrease, a modeling exercise that projects future mortality is one approach in the attempt to move from the surrogate endpoint (incidence) to the endpoint of arguably
greater interest (mortality).
However, any attempt to extrapolate a mortality
effect from an incidence one must be interpreted cautiously. In the current analysis of the PCPT trial, due to
widely expressed concerns about the preponderance of
cancers (primarily Gleason score 2 to 6 tumors) that were
not detected for cause and that may have limited clinical
significance, we made efforts to carefully stratify cases by

significant prognostic variables, T classification and PSA,
in addition to Gleason score, when applying survival rates
from the PLCO trial. In the PCPT trial, 78% of finasteride treatment arm and 77% of placebo arm Gleason score
2 to 6 cancers were classified as T1a to T1c, which was
modestly higher than the comparable percentage in the
PLCO trial (68%). Because of this stratification, the survival rates we applied should reasonably approximate the
true rates for the PCPT cohort. In addition, we estimated
the RR of mortality, which is less sensitive to survival rate
fluctuations than the absolute mortality rates. For the
REDUCE trial, because men had generally high (> 4 ng/
mL) baseline PSA levels, concerns about clinically insignificant disease were lower, and without stage or PSA data
available to us, we stratified survival based only on Gleason score. To assess the potential effect of additional stratification by PSA and tumor stage, we repeated the PCPT
analysis using only the Gleason categories (scores 2-6, 7,
and 8-10) as survival strata. Although absolute mortality
rates were 10% to 20% higher, the RRs were very similar:
0.99 (vs 1.02) for the unadjusted analysis and 0.87 and
0.88 (compared with 0.87 and 0.91), respectively, for the
2 adjusted analyses. Thus further stratification for the
REDUCE trial would likely have resulted in little change
in the estimated RR for mortality.
Although, we stratified survival by Gleason score,
PSA, and disease stage for the PCPT trial, there are other
prognostic factors that we were unable to account for
because they were not collected in PLCO. The Cancer of
the Prostate Risk Assessment (CAPRA) risk assessment
tool, which has been validated as a predictor of prostate
cancer-specific mortality, uses percentage positive core
needle biopsies in addition to Gleason score, PSA, and
disease stage (and patient age) in determining a 10-point
prognostic index; specifically, 1 point is allotted for percentage positive core needle biopsies > 33%.17 Analysis
of the PCPT indicated that for cases of Gleason score 2 to
6 low-risk (T1/T2) disease, there was an approximately
5% differential by treatment arm in cases meeting this
threshold, with higher rates noted in the placebo arm. In
addition, a 1-point increase in the CAPRA score in lowrisk men results in an approximately 2% decrease in the
10-year prostate-specific survival.17 Using these numbers,
we were able to effectively further stratify the PLCO survival strata for Gleason score 2 to 6 disease by percentage
positive core needle biopsies. The result was essentially no
change in the mortality RRs: 1.02 and 0.87, respectively,
as before for the unadjusted and adjusted RP Gleason
score analysis and 0.90 versus 0.91 for the adjusted volume analysis.

There is a general consensus in the research community that some bias in prostate cancer detection and/or biopsy grading occurred in the PCPT trial, either of which
would favor the finasteride treatment arm; however, the
magnitude of such a bias and the appropriate methods for
adjusting for it are less clear. Using 2 previously published
methods for such an adjustment, we obtained RR estimates that were very similar (0.87 and 0.91). Another
adjusted analysis, which also used the RP Gleason score
results, produced lower incidence RR estimates for Gleason score 7 to 10 and 8 to 10 disease (RRs of 0.73 and
1.25, respectively) than did the RP Gleason score method
used in the current study (RRs of 0.87 and 1.44, respectively).9 Applying this analysis to our mortality projections would result in a lower mortality RR than those
noted herein. A similar artifact with respect to biopsy
grading and the detection of prostate cancer may have also
occurred in the REDUCE trial. An analysis of the effects
of dutasteride on prostate volume estimated that cancer
detection rates were increased by 11% to 17% in men
treated with dutasteride compared with placebo.18
Adjusting for such artifacts would reduce the projected
mortality RR estimate for dutasteride from that computed
in the current study.
Several prior analyses used prostate cancer survival
rates to assess the benefits versus harms of finasteride, with
life-years saved used as the metric.7-9 Each produced a
range of estimates depending on whether Gleason score
differences were deemed artifactual as well as other considerations. Grover et al demonstrated per person lifeyears gained of between 0.02 to 0.2 years and Lotan et al
reported similar life-years gained of between 0.35 to 3
months (0.03-0.25 years); the greatest gains were achieved
under the assumption that all Gleason score differences
were artifactual whereas the lowest were achieved assuming the score differences were as observed and that only
cancers detected during for-cause biopsy contributed to
mortality.7,8 Using SEER survival rates, Zeliadt et al demonstrated gains of between 0.006 to 0.04 life-years per
person, with the latter derived assuming Gleason score
differences were artifactual.9 However, as mentioned earlier, the survival rates used in these analyses were not
derived from the experience of highly screened cohorts.
For example, Lotan et al used a 15-year cause-specific survival rate for Gleason score 5 to 6 disease of 85% (for men
aged 60-64 years) based on a case series of clinically
detected cancers, whereas in the current analysis (Table
3), the 13-year cause-specific survival rate for Gleason
score 2 to 6 cases (92% of which were Gleason score 5-6
tumors) was 96.2%. Analysis of PLCO and SEER data
599

Original Article

indicates that for Gleason score 5 to 7 cases the death rate
(ie, 1-cumulatitve survival rate) was approximately onethird lower in the PLCO trial compared with what would
be expected based on SEER survival rates.
One can convert the deaths rates shown in Table 4
to life-years saved, at least for the 13-year follow-up period
used in the current study. For cases with Gleason scores 2
to 6, 7, and 8 to 10, the average life-years lost during this
period for a man dying of prostate cancer were 4.0, 4.4,
and 6.1 life-years, respectively, based on the PLCO survival rates. Taking the adjusted RP Gleason analysis
results as an example, the differential death rate per 1000
(placebo minus finasteride) of 1.5 (ie, 4.0-2.5) for Gleason score 2 to 6 disease translates into a relative life-years
gained for men treated on the finasteride arm of 6.0 per
1000 (1.5*4.0). A similar analysis for Gleason score 7 and
Gleason score 8 to 10 cases demonstrated relative lifeyears gained for men treated on the finasteride arm of 8.8
(2.0*4.4) and 7.3 (-1.2*6.1) per 1000, respectively.
This sums to 0.0075 life-years gained per person (or 7.5
per 1000), which is 5 to 33 times less than the most optimistic figures from the above-mentioned 3 studies.7-9
These divergent results are explained by the higher survival rates, especially for Gleason score 2 to 6 tumors,
used in the current analysis, as well as by differences in
how the possible grading artifact is dealt with. Although
our RP Gleason score analysis adjusted for bias by treatment arm in grading, it retained differences in the percentage incidence reductions by Gleason score; in
contrast, in the above-mentioned studies, percentage incidence reductions were assumed to be constant across
Gleason score categories when grade differences were
assumed to be artifactual. Differences in the follow-up
time periods used could also lead to some differences in
the estimates.
As a thought experiment, consider an actual mortality endpoint trial that demonstrated incidence trends similar to those noted in the PCPT and REDUCE trials (ie,
overall decrease but possible increase in high-stage disease
while receiving the drug) but demonstrated either: 1) a
statistically significant mortality reduction; 2) no significant mortality reduction but a point estimate for the mortality RR < 1 and an upper bound only slightly > 1; or 3)
a point estimate modestly > 1.0 (regardless of whether it
was statistically significant or not). Under the first scenario, despite harm to some individual men, it is likely
that most would conclude that the benefits outweigh the
harms, whereas for the third scenario, the consensus
would likely be strongly against using the drugs. In the
second scenario, the benefit is essentially confined to
600

reductions in cancer incidence only, which, given the frequent and serious side effects of standard prostate cancer
treatments, is substantial in itself. However, for this to
outweigh harms, one would need confidence that there
was no true mortality increase or that it was at most negligibly small. With the current modeling exercise, we have
in effect scenario 2 (assuming one uses the adjusted PCPT
analyses), except that there is further uncertainty due to
the finding that it is only a â€˜â€˜virtualâ€™â€™ trial, with all of the
caveats of modeling and extrapolation. Nonetheless, the
analysis is useful in attempting to quantify the effects of
these drugs on prostate cancer mortality, especially
because they are currently approved for the treatment of
benign prostatic hyperplasia and are used for that purpose
by many men.
Conclusions

The PCPT and REDUCE trials of 5a-reductase inhibitors each demonstrated a significant overall decrease in
prostate cancer incidence for the treatment arm along
with a trend toward an increase in high-grade disease. Projecting a mortality outcome of these trials as an approach
to weighing benefits versus harms demonstrates that there
likely would have been at most a small increase in prostate
cancer deaths in the treatment arms, and possibly a modest decrease.
