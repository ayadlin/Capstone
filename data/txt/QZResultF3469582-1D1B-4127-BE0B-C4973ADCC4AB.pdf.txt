Abstract

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

T-cell immunoglobulin domain and mucin domain-3 (TIM-3, also known as HAVCR2) is an
activation-induced inhibitory molecule involved in tolerance and shown to induce T-cell
exhaustion in chronic viral infection and cancers1–5. Under some conditions, TIM-3 expression
has also been shown to be stimulatory. Considering that TIM-3, like cytotoxic T lymphocyte
antigen 4 (CTLA-4) and programmed death 1 (PD-1), is being targeted for cancer immunotherapy,
it is important to identify the circumstances under which TIM-3 can inhibit and activate T-cell
responses. Here we show that TIM-3 is co-expressed and forms a heterodimer with
carcinoembryonic antigen cell adhesion molecule 1 (CEACAM1), another well-known molecule
expressed on activated T cells and involved in T-cell inhibition6–10. Biochemical, biophysical and
X-ray crystallography studies show that the membrane-distal immunoglobulin-variable (IgV)-like
amino-terminal domain of each is crucial to these interactions. The presence of CEACAM1
endows TIM-3 with inhibitory function. CEACAM1 facilitates the maturation and cell surface
expression of TIM-3 by forming a heterodimeric interaction in cis through the highly related
membrane-distal N-terminal domains of each molecule. CEACAM1 and TIM-3 also bind in trans
through their N-terminal domains. Both cis and trans interactions between CEACAM1 and TIM-3
determine the tolerance-inducing function of TIM-3. In a mouse adoptive transfer colitis model,
CEACAM1-deficient T cells are hyper-inflammatory with reduced cell surface expression of
TIM-3 and regulatory cytokines, and this is restored by T-cell-specific CEACAM1 expression.
During chronic viral infection and in a tumour environment, CEACAM1 and TIM-3 mark
exhausted T cells. Co-blockade of CEACAM1 and TIM-3 leads to enhancement of anti-tumour
immune responses with improved elimination of tumours in mouse colorectal cancer models.
Thus, CEACAM1 serves as a heterophilic ligand for TIM-3 that is required for its ability to
mediate T-cell inhibition, and this interaction has a crucial role in regulating autoimmunity and
anti-tumour immunity.

We examined the role of CEACAM1 in ovalbumin (OVA)-specific peripheral T-cell
tolerance11. OVA protein administration (Extended Data Fig. 1a) resulted intolerance
induction in wild-type OVA-specific T-cell receptor transgenic OT-II Rag2−/− mice (Fig.
1a), but not in transgenic OT-II Ceacam1−/− Rag2−/− mice (Fig. 1b). Transfer of
carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFSE)-labelled naive CD4+ Vα2+ T cells
from transgenic OT-II Rag2−/− mice into Ceacam1−/− recipients (Extended Data Fig. 1b, c)
was associated with increased OVA induced proliferation (Fig. 1c) and TIM-3 expression
uniformly restricted to proliferating CEACAM1+ T cells (Fig. 1d and Extended Data Fig.
1d).
CD4+ T-cell receptor (TCR) Vβ8+ T cells in Ceacam1−/−, but not wild-type, mice lacked
TIM-3 expression after Staphylococcus aureus enterotoxin B (SEB) administration,
suggesting CEACAM1 and TIM-3 co-expression on tolerized T cells (Extended Data Fig.
1e, f). Flag-tagged human (h) CEACAM1 enhanced cell surface expression of co-transfected

haemagglutinin (HA)-tagged hTIM-3 in human embryonic kidney 293T (HEK293T) cells,
with virtually all hTIM-3-positive HEK293T cells notably CEACAM1-positive (Fig. 1e).
Human T cells co-expressed TIM-3 and CEACAM1 after in vitro activation with decreased
CEACAM1 expression after TIM3 (also known as HAVCR2) silencing (Fig. 1f and
Extended Data Fig. 1g, h). Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected, but not
uninfected, subjects exhibited increased CEACAM1+ TIM-3+ (double-positive) CD4+ T
cells, which were poor producers of interferon-γ (IFN-γ), as were double-positive CD8+ T
cells (Fig. 1g, h and Extended Data Fig. 1i–l). In situ proximity ligation analysis12 of
hCEACAM1 and hTIM-3 co-transfected HEK293T cells (Fig. 1i and Extended Data Fig.
1m–o), and co-cultures of activated primary human T cells (Extended Data Fig. 1p, q)
confirmed the nearness of both molecules on the cell surface of HEK293T cells and colocalization within the immune synapse of activated T cells, respectively.

TIM-3 has been proposed to engage an unknown ligand13 (Extended Data Fig. 2a–c), and
we considered CEACAM1 a possible candidate that is known to homodimerize14.
Modelling available X-ray crystallographic structures of mouse (m) CEACAM1 (ref. 14)
and mTIM-3 (ref. 13) membrane-distal IgV-like, N-terminal domains predicted structural
similarity with extensive interactions along their FG–CC′ interface in cis and trans
configurations (Extended Data Fig. 2d–g and Supplementary Information). Mouse T-cell
lymphoma cells predicted to possess a novel TIM-3 ligand expressed CEACAM1 (refs 13,
15) (Extended Data Fig. 2h, i). hCEACAM1, but not integrin α5 (ITGA5) (Extended Data
Fig. 3a), was co-immunoprecipitated with hTIM-3 and vice-versa from co-transfected
HEK293T cells (Fig. 2a, b). Co-immunoprecipitation of CEACAM1 and TIM-3 was
confirmed with activated primary human T cells (Extended Data Fig. 3b) and primary
mouse T cells from either Ceacam1–4LTg Ceacam1−/− mice6 or Ceacam1–4STg
Ceacam1−/− mice10 (transgenic mice in which CEACAM1 isoforms containing a long (L)
or short (S) cytoplasmic tail, respectively, are conditionally overexpressed in T cells)7
(Extended Data Fig. 3c).

Although tunicamycin treatment had no effect (Extended Data Fig. 3d), mutation of amino
acid residues including natural human allelic variants anticipated to be involved in these
interactions disrupted the co-immunoprecipitation of hCEACAM1 and hTIM-3 in cotransfected HEK293T cells (Fig. 2c, d, Extended Data Fig. 3e–s, Extended Data Table 1 and
Supplementary Information).
A single-chain of the hCEACAM1 N-terminal domain (amino acids 1–107) joined to the
hTIM-3 N-terminal domain (amino acids 1–105) by a linker (GGGGS)4 with a hexahistidine
tag appended to the carboxy terminus was expressed in Escherichia coli (Extended Data Fig.
4a), and shown to interact specifically with the N-terminal domain of hTIM-3 by surface
plasmon resonance (Extended Data Fig. 4b–e). This single-chain protein was crystallized
and a structural model built from X-ray diffraction data (Extended Data Table 2). This
revealed two similar copies of a hCEACAM1 (IgV domain)–hTIM-3 (IgV domain)
heterodimer interacting along each of the respective FG–CC′ faces (Fig. 2e) and at amino
acid contact points demonstrated to be involved in biochemical interactions between
hCEACAM1 and hTIM-3 (Fig. 2f, g and Extended Data Fig. 4f–h), with no conformational
changes of the hCEACAM1 IgV domain upon forming a heterodimer with hTIM-3 in

Metabolic labelling (Fig. 2h–j) showed overall enhancement of hTIM-3 biosynthesis after
hCEACAM1 co-expression with decreased cell surface display, intracellular accumulation
and hypoglycosylation of hTIM-3 when mutant, hypomorphic forms of hTIM-3 or
hCEACAM1 were co-expressed in HEK293T cells (Extended Data Fig. 5a–e). Especially
profound was a natural hTIM-3 variant (rs147827860 (Thr101Ile)) that although exhibiting
normal core protein association with hCEACAM1 (Extended Data Fig. 5f) could not be
rescued by hCEACAM1 co-expression and remained hypoglycosylated with increased
intracellular retention and a near absence of cell surface expression (Fig. 2h, i, Extended
Data Fig. 5a, b, e and Supplementary Information).

CD4+ T cells from SEB-treated Ceacam1−/− miceormice with transgenic overexpression of
Tim3 (also known as Havcr2) in T cells16 lacking CEACAM1 expression (Tim3Tg
Ceacam1−/−) exhibited diminished expression of all mTIM-3 forms (fully glycosylated,
hypoglycosylated and core protein) (Fig. 2k), decreased upregulation of TIM-3 expression
on the cell surface (Fig. 2l) and blunted deletion of CD4+ Vβ8+ T cells (Extended Data Fig.
5g) relative to wild-type or transgenic Tim3Tg mice expressing endogenous CEACAM1. Thelper 1 (TH1) polarized cells from Tim3Tg Ceacam1−− mice were resistant to galectin-9induced apoptosis (Extended Data Fig. 5h), which is dependent on TIM-3 expression as a
glycoprotein15.

The hTIM-3 N-terminal domain bound hCEACAM1 and stained the cell surface of human
CEACAM1–4L–transfected Jurkat T cells (Fig. 2m and Extended Data Fig. 5i, j). Transligation of wild-type mouse CD4+ T cells with a mCEACAM1 N–terminal domain–Fc
fusion protein (NFc) rendered them unresponsive to in vitro stimulation with anti-CD3 and
anti-CD28 (Fig. 2n and Extended Data Fig. 5k). CD4+ T cells from SEB-treated Tim3Tg or
Tim3 Ceacam1−/− mice exhibited similar levels of TIM-3 associated BAT3, a repressor of
TIM-3 cytoplasmic tail signalling17, at the time of T-cell isolation (Fig. 2o). However, only
T cells from SEB-tolerized Tim3Tg mice, but not SEB-treated Tim3Tg Ceacam1−/− mice that
were resistant to SEB-induced tolerance, exhibited BAT3 dissociation from mTIM-3 after
NFc fusion protein ligation with further release observed after addition of anti-CD3 (Fig. 2o
and Extended Data Fig. 5l, m). We observed similar levels of NFc fusion protein staining of
primary T cells from Tim3Tg and Tim3Tg Ceacam1−/− mice, relative to that observed with
Ceacam1−/− mice, which was blocked by a TIM-3-specific antibody (Extended Data Fig.
5n), implicating heterophilic ligation of TIM-3 as the major factor responsible for T-cell
inhibition and BAT3 release.
Highly activated CD4+ T cells from wild-type and Ceacam1−/− mice were transduced with a
retrovirus encoding green fluorescent protein (GFP) plus mTIM-3. Anti-CD3 induced
proliferation and TNF-α secretion was inhibited by NFc fusion protein ligation in
transduced wild-type but not Ceacam1−/− T cells or all groups transduced with GFP alone
(Fig. 2p, q and Extended Data Fig. 5o, p). Both wild-type and Ceacam1−/− T-cell
transductants with a mTIM-3 cytoplasmic tail deletion construct (TIM-3Δ252–281)17,18 were

Tolerance pathways are important in T-cell regulation19. We detected homozygous
rs147827860 (Thr101Ile) carriage in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) but not controls
(Extended Data Table 3a–c). We thus transferred naive CD4+ CD62Lhigh CD44− T cells
from wild-type mice into Ceacam1−/− Rag2−/− recipients and observed colon-infiltrating
CEACAM1+ TIM-3+ T cells expressing markedly decreased intracellular levels of IFN-γ,
IL-2 and IL-17A relative to other lamina propria T cells (Fig. 3a, b). Colon-infiltrating
lamina propria T cells from adoptive transfer of naive Ceacam1−/− CD4+ T cells into
Ceacam1−/− Rag2−/− recipients expressed reduced cell surface levels of TIM-3 (Fig. 3c) and
increased intracellular levels of TNF-α (Fig. 3d) in association with a severe progressive
colitis with increased mortality (Fig. 3e, dagger symbol), and histopathological evidence of
injury (Fig. 3f) characterized by acute and chronic inflammation (Extended Data Fig. 6a).
Reestablishment of T-cell-specific mCEACAM1–4L expression using CeaCAM1–4LTg
CeaCAM1−/− mice6, restored TIM-3 display and decreased intracellular TNF-α expression
by the infiltrating lamina propria T cells together with decreased disease severity (Fig. 3c–f
and Extended Data Fig. 6b), reflective of CEACAM1+ TIM-3+ T-cell restoration.

CD4+ T cells from Tim3Tg CeaCAM1−/− mice, in contrast to those from CEACAM1proficient Tim3Tg mice, were hyper-inflammatory after transfer into CeaCAM1−/− Rag2−/−
recipients and caused significant weight loss and severe colitis with increased expression of
TH17 signature genes (Fig. 3g–i and Extended Data Fig. 6c, d). Nanostring (Extended Data
Fig. 6e) and quantitative PCR (Fig. 3j) analysis of lamina propria mononuclear cells
demonstrated increased transcripts for Ebi3, IL-27p28 (also known as Il27) and IL-12p35
(also known as Il12a) encoding the regulatory cytokines IL-27 and IL-35 (refs 20, 21) in
CeaCAM1−/− Rag2−/− recipients of CD4+ T cells from Tim3Tg relative to wild-type mice,
and their absence in recipients of CeaCAM1−/− or Tim3Tg CeaCAM1−/− T cells.

Anti-tumour immunity is hindered by T-cell expression of inhibitory molecules associated
with an exhausted phenotype22. We observed high levels of CEACAM1+ TIM-3+, relative
to PD-1+ TIM-3+, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells at the tumour site of wild-type mice in the
azoxymethane (AOM)/dextran sodium sulphate (DSS) model of colitis-associated colon
cancer (Extended Data Fig. 6f–j). At 2.5% DSS, Tim3Tg mice exhibited 100% fatality,
significantly greater than all other genotypes (Fig. 4a). Tumour quantification at a lower
DSS dose (1.5%) showed that the polyp numbers, polyp size, high-grade dysplasia and frank
carcinoma were significantly higher in Tim3Tg than in wild-type mice with decreased
neoplasia observed in Tim3Tg CeaCAM1−/− and CeaCAM1−/− mice (Fig. 4b–d and Extended
Data Fig. 6k).
After implantation of colorectal cancer cells (CT26) subcutaneously in BALB/c mice, a
significant fraction of CD8+ tumour infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) was triple-positive T
cells (TIM-3+ PD-1+ CEACAM1+), with the relative cell surface levels of TIM-3 correlating
with CEACAM1 (Fig. 4e). PD-1+ TIM-3bright CEACAM1+ T cells were characterized by
extremely low intracellular IL-2 and TNF-α expression consistent with exhaustion (Fig. 4f).

tumour growth in a preventative model (Fig. 4g and Extended Data Fig. 7a), and was able to
exceed protection with co-blockade of PD-1 and TIM-3 (Extended Data Fig. 7b, c). In a
therapeutic model, blockade of CEACAM1 synergized with PD-1 inhibition (Extended Data
Fig. 7d, e). CEACAM1 and TIM-3 co-blockade was associated with increased CD8+ (Fig.
4h) and CD4+ (Fig. 4i) TILs with enhanced IFN-γ production (Fig. 4j) and decreased IL-10
production (Extended Data Fig. 7f) by the infiltrating CD8+ and CD4+ T cells, respectively.
Increased tumour antigen-specific CD8+ T cells defined by AH1-tetramer staining23,
relative to the total CD8+ T-cell population (Fig. 4k and Extended Data Fig. 7g) was
observed in the draining lymph nodes that correlated with tumour growth inhibition
(Extended Data Fig. 7h). CT26 tumour growth was impeded in CeaCAM1−/− mice (Fig. 4l)
in association with increased AH-1 tetramer+ CD8+ T cells in draining lymph nodes (Fig.
4m and Extended Data Fig. 7i) and decreased TIM-3 expression on tumour-associated TILs
(Fig. 4n).

In conclusion, we show that CEACAM1 and TIM-3 form a new heterodimeric complex that
is determined by interactions between their structurally similar membrane-distal IgV-like,
N-terminal domains. This association is evident during early biosynthesis and crucial for
proper maturation, cell surface display and function of TIM-3 and probably CEACAM1
when expressed together. CEACAM1 also functions as an essential trans-heterophilic ligand
for TIM-3 with the tolerance-inducing functions of TIM-3 requiring interactions with
CEACAM1 in both cis and trans configurations. CEACAM1 expression with TIM-3 is
further characteristic of T cells with an exhausted phenotype such that in the absence of
these interactions inflammatory responses are unrestrained and anti-tumour immunity
enhanced. Together, these studies describe a novel class of heterodimeric protein
interactions that function in tolerance induction with broad implications for many types of
infectious, autoimmune and neoplastic conditions.

METHODS
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Mice
C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratory. Ceacam1−/− mice
(C57BL/6 and BALB/c backcrosses) were generated by N. Beauchemin24. Transgenic OT-II
Ceacam1−/− Rag2−/− mice were generated by first crossing Ceacam1−/− mice to
Rag2−/−(Taconic) for >6 generations to obtain Ceacam1−/− Rag2−/− double-knockout mice
on aC57BL/6 background, followed by crossing these mice to transgenic OT-II Rag2−/−
mice (Taconic) for >9 generations.Tim3Tg (ref. 16) and Ceacam1−/− mice on a C57BL/6
background were intercrossed to generate Tim3Tg Ceacam1−/− mice. Ceacam1–4LTg
Ceacam1−/− and Ceacam1–4STg Ceacam1−− mice have been previously described6,10. All
studies were performed in mice with a C57BL/6 genetic background except for CT26
tumour experiments that were in a BALB/c genetic background. Animal studies were
conducted in a gender and age-matched manner for all experiments. Both male and female
mice were used and were 6–8 weeks of age at the time of experiments or 6–10 weeks for the

adoptive transfer colitis experiments. The number of animals used per group was based on
previous experimental results and observed variability. Histopathology analysis was
performed in a blinded manner by an expert pathologist (J.N.G.). For all other in vitro and in
vivo analyses, investigators were not blinded to treatment allocation. All experiments were
approved and conducted according to the guidelines set forth by the Harvard Medical Area
Standing Committee on Animals.
Genotyping
Mouse tails were digested in tail lysis buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 5 mM EDTA,
0.2%SDS, 200 mM NaCl and proteinase K (Roche)) overnight at 55 °C. Genomic DNA was
phenol-extracted and isopropanol precipitated. DNA was dissolved in TE buffer. The primer
sequences for genotyping are available on request.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

For SEB tolerance induction model, animals of the indicated genotypes were injected
intraperitoneally with 25 µg of SEB (Millipore) on days 0 and 4, and euthanized at day 8
after the first injection. Peripheral lymph node cells were isolated and stained for T-cell
receptor Vβ6, Vβ8 and CD4, and analysed for TIM-3 and CEACAM1 expression on CD4+
Vβ8+ cells. Cells were also re-stimulated in vitro at 0.5 × 106 cells per ml with anti-CD3
(0.1–10.0 µg ml−1) and assessed for proliferation by [3H]-thymidine (1 µCi ml−1) uptake or
production of IL-2 by ELISA. For OVA antigen-specific T-cell tolerance induction, highdose OVA antigen was used and modified according to previous studies11,25,26. In brief,
transgenic OT-II Rag2−/− or Ceacam1−/− Rag2−/− mice were injected intraperitonally with
500 µg of OVA peptide (323–339, 323-ISQAVHAAHAEINEAGR-329, AnaSpec) in an
equal volume a mount of complete Freund’s adjuvant (CFA) or PBS alone at day 0
(activation of immune response) and at day 4 (tolerance induction). At day 10, CD4+ T cells
were isolated from spleens and pooled peripheral lymphocytes from each experimentally
treated mouse as indicated above. The pooled lymphocytes from each mouse were restimulated in vitro with various concentrations of OVA323–339 peptide (0.1, 1, 2.5 and 10 µg
ml−1). The 96-well cultures were set up with a total cell number of 2.5 × 104 in 200 µl RPMI
complete medium pulsed with 1 µCi [3H]-thymidine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for the
final 8h of the 72h assay, and collected with a Packard Micromate cell harvester. Counts per
minute (c.p.m.) were determined using a Packard Matrix 96 direct counter (Packard
Biosciences) and data expressed as median values. For in vivo tracking of OVA-specific
antigen-specific T-cell responses, adoptive transfer experiments were performed on the basis
of previous studies27. In brief, CD4+ Vα2+ T cells were isolated from spleens and pooled
peripheral lymphocytes of transgenic OT-II Ceacam1+/+ (wild-type) Rag2−/− mice and the
cells were pre-incubated for 10 min with 4 mM CFSE in PBS plus 0.1% FBS. CFSElabelled cells (5 × 105) were injected intravenously by tail vein into syngeneic C57BL/6
wild-type or Ceacam1−/− recipients. After 18h to allow the adoptively transferred T cells to
establish themselves in vivo, and which showed no differences in parking of the T cells
among the various genotypes, the mice were then immunized with OVA323–339 (50 µg) in an
equal volume of CFA. On day 3, cells were collected from spleen, mesenteric lymph and
peripheral lymph node of individual mice and stained with DAPI to exclude dead cells, and
concurrently stained with anti-CD4–PerCp, anti-CEACAM1– allophycocyanin and antiNature. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2015 January 17.

Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from buffy coats from
healthy anonymous donors according to an Institutional Review Board approved protocol
from Brigham and Women’s Hospital. CD4+ T cells were purified from PBMC using CD4
Microbeads (Miltenyi) and cultured in RPMI-1640 supplemented with 10% FBS
(Invitrogen), L-glutamine, non-essential amino acids, sodium pyruvate, 20 mM HEPES and
100 IU ml−1 recombinant human IL-2 (R&D Systems). The T cells were stimulated with
plate-bound anti-CD3 (OKT3) and anti-CD28 (CD28.2) antibodies (1 µg ml−1 each,

Maple Leaf Clinic institutional ethics boards. Written informed consent was provided for
this study, which was reviewed by research ethics board of the University of Toronto,
Canada and of St. Michael’s Hospital, Toronto, Canada. Individuals were recruited from a
Toronto-based cohort (Maple Leaf Clinic and St. Michael’s Hospital, Toronto, Canada).
Samples were obtained from HIV-positive chronically infected antiretroviral treatment naive
individuals (infected >1 year, with detectable viral load) and demographically matched HIVseronegative individuals. Whole blood was collected in anti-coagulant treated tubes and
PBMCs were isolated using Ficoll-Paque PLUS (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences) and stored at
−15 °Cuntil future use. PBMCs from healthy HIV-1-uninfected and HIV-1-infected
individuals were stained with CEACAM1 monoclonal antibody (clone 26H7), detected with
a fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibody, followed by fluorophore-conjugated
monoclonal antibodies to CD4, CD8 and CD3 (BioLegend), and TIM-3 (R & D Systems) to
determine phenotype assessment. An Aqua amine dye (Invitrogen) was used to discriminate
live and dead cells. For functional experiments, cells were stimulated after thawing with 1
µg ml−1 of overlapping HIV-1 Clade B Gag peptide pool (National Institutes of Health
AIDS Reagent Program), or 1 µg ml−1 SEB (Sigma Aldrich) in the presence of brefeldin A
(Sigma) for 6h. Surface staining was followed by a fixation and per-meabilization step.
Intracellular staining for cytokines was performed using anti-IFN-γ (Biolegend). Cells were
fixed in 2% formalin/PBS and acquired with a modified LSRII system (BD Biosciences). A
total of 100,000 events were collected and analysed with FlowJo software (Tree Star).
In situ proximity ligation assay

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Proximity ligation assay was performed using Duolink in situ PLA reagents on HEK293T
cells co-transfected with human CEACAM1– Flag-tagged and human TIM-3–HA-tagged
vectors. Primary antibodies used were anti-Flag or anti-HA antibodies and followed by
secondary antibodies. Cells on slides were blocked with Duolink Blocking stock followed
by the application of two PLA probes in 1× antibody diluent. The slides were washed in a
wash buffer (1× TBS-T) for 5 min twice and processed for hybridization using Duolink
Hybridization stock 1:5 in high purity water and followed by incubation for 15 min at 37 °C.
Duolink Ligation was performed with ligase and the slides were incubated in a pre-heated
humidity chamber for 15 min at 37 °C. Amplification was then achieved using Duolink
Amplification stock containing the polymerase and the slides were incubated again in a preheated humidity chamber for 90 min at 37 °C. DNA was stained with DAPI. A proximity
ligation assay probe generates a fluorescent signal only when it binds to two primary
antibodies (anti-HA and anti-Flag) attached to two proteins that are in maximum distance of
30–40 nm (ref. 12) to each other. One individual dot represents the close proximity of two
interacting proteins within the cells.
Confocal microscopy of T–B-cell conjugates
CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were isolated from human PBMCs by negative selection (EasySep,
StemCell Technologies) and expanded by incubation with 1 µg ml−1 anti-CD3 (clone OKT3;
BioLegend), 1 µg ml−1 anti-CD28 monoclonal antibody (clone 28.8; BioLegend) with 50 U
ml−1 of recombinant IL-2 (National Institutes of Health) in complete RPMI media for 5 days
to upregulate CEACAM1 and TIM-3. After overnigh trest, T cells were mixed in a 2:1 ratio
with Cell Tracker Blue CMAC (Invitrogen)-labelled human EBV-transformed B cells preNature. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2015 January 17.

loaded with SEB (Sigma-Aldrich), and brought into contact by centrifugation at 200g for 5
min. Cells were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min and deposited onto poly-L-lysine coated
coverslips for an additional 15 min. Cells were fixed in 4% formaldehyde, permeabilized,
blocked and stained with primary antibodies against CD3-ε (Abcam), CEACAM1
(clone5F4) and TIM-3 (R&D Systems) and appropriate fluorescently labelled secondary
antibody. After immunofluorescent labelling, coverslips were mounted on glass slides using
ProLong Gold antifade reagent (Invitrogen) and cured in the dark at room temperature for
24h. Imaging was performed on an Olympus IX81 confocal microscope. Z-stack images
(0.15 µm) of conjugates were acquired with a ×60 Plan-Apochromat oil objective, numerical
aperture 1.42.
Image processing and analysis
All fluorescence images were background subtracted, annotated and exported using
Olympus Fluoview FV100 image viewer. Colocalization analysis and Pearson’s correlation
coefficient was calculated from corresponding interface regions from two channels using
Volocity. For presentation in figures, images were adjusted and cropped equally across
related groups.

Mutagenesis of human CEACAM1 and TIM-3
Point mutations were introduced by PCR-based mutagenesis, using the QuikChange II SiteDirected Mutagenesis Kit (Agilent Technologies). The mutant oligonucleotides are listed in
Extended Data Table 1a, b. Previously described vectors containing the human CEACAM1–
3L variant34 and human TIM-3 in the pDisplay vector (Invitrogen)35 were used as the
template for all mutations. PCR reactions for single amino acid mutations were run for 16
cycles of 30s at 95 °C and 1 min at 55 °C, followed by 6 min at 68 °C. The resulting mutant
plasmids were verified by Sanger DNA sequencing. TIM-3 amino acid residues were
numbered according to National Center for Biotechnology Information database.
Cell culture, transfection, tunicamycin treatment, immunoprecipitation and
immunoblotting

HEK293T cells transfected with the 1,200 ng of Flag-tagged human CEACAM1 wild-type
or mutant vectors or 1,200 ng of Flag-tagged ITGA5 (NM_002205; Origene) and 1,200 ng
of HA-tagged human TIM-3 wild-type or mutant vectors or 1,200 ng of vector controls
when mono-transfections were performed and cells transfected for 48 h. In some
experiments, 6 h after transfection, transfected cells were treated with 2 µg ml−1 or 10 µg
ml−1 tunicamyin provided in DMSO for the last 24 h of transfection. Transfected cells were
washed once with cold PBS and lysed on ice with 0.5 ml of immunoprecipitation buffer
containing 20 mM Tris-HCl, 0.15 M sodium chloride, pH7.6, with protease inhibitor
cocktail tablets (Roche) and 1.0% digitonin (Sigma). After 60 min, the cell lysates were
spun at 14,000 r.p.m. for 30 min at 4 °C. The lysate was subsequently incubated with 5 µl of
protein A–Sepharose (Sigma) that had been pre-adsorbed with an equal volume of
immunoprecipitation buffer followed by three 1-h incubations with protein A–Sepharose.
The pre-cleared lysates were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with 10 µl of protein A–Sepharose
beads bound to the specific antibodies. Some immunoprecipitates were incubated with

immunoprecipitation buffer and re-suspended in 30 µl of Laemmli sample buffer without
reducing agents. After boiling for 5 min, the proteins were resolved by SDS–PAGE in
regular Tris-glycine buffer on a 4–20% Tris-Glycine Gel (Novex). The proteins were
electrically transferred to a PVDF (polyvinylidene difluoride) membrane. After blocking
with 5% skim milk in 0.05% PBS-Tween (PBS-T), the membranes were incubated for 12 h
at 4 °C with primary antibodies. The membranes were further incubated with corresponding
secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature and visualized by Amersham ECL
Western Blotting Detection Reagents (GE Healthcare). The specific antibodies used for
immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting in this assay were anti-Flag antibody produced in
rabbit (Sigma), HA.11 (16B12) (Covance), anti-HA-Tag-agarose (MBL, Medical &
Biological Laboratories Co), anti-HA antibody produced in rabbit and in mouse (Sigma) and
anti-human CEACAM1 antibody, 5F4. Unsaturated films were digitally scanned and band
intensities (densitometric analysis) were quantified using ImageJ (NIH).
Co-immunoprecipitation of primary T cells

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Primary human CD4+ T cells were purified and activated with plate bound anti-CD3 (1 µg
ml−1) and anti-CD28 (1 µg ml−1) in the presence of recombinant (r) IL-2 (10 ng ml−1; NIH)
for 5 days. Cells were then rested in rIL-2 containing (10 ng ml−1) complete medium for 3
days and re-stimulated with soluble anti-CD3 (1 µg ml−1) for 2 days. Cell lysates were
prepared as above and treated with N-glycanase by the manufacturer’s suggested protocol
(Promega). N-glycanase treated lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-human TIM-3
antibodies (2E2, 2E12 and 3F9) or mouse IgG1 as control and the immunoprecipitates
subjected to SDS–PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes followed by immunoblotting
with the mouse anti-human CEACAM1 monoclonal antibody, 5F4, as described above.
Primary mouse splenocytes were prepared from Ceacam1–4LTg Ceacam1−/− and Ceacam1–
4STg Ceacam1−/− mice and cultured in the presence of anti-CD3 (1 µg ml−1) or anti-CD3 (1
µg/ml−1) plus anti-CD28 (1 µg ml−1) or medium only for 96 h. Cell lysates were prepared,
immunoprecipitated with cc1 (anti-mCEACAM1) and immunblotted with 5D12 (antimTIM-3) monoclonal antibodies as described above.

Pulse-chase experiments, immunoprecipitation, endoglycosidaseH digestion and SDS–
PAGE
Cells were transfected as above with wild-type human HA-tagged hTIM-3 or Thr101Ile
variant of HA-tagged hTIM-3 with or without co-transfection with Flag-tagged human
CEACAM1 vector. All transfections included a co-transfection with Flag-tagged influenza
virus M2 protein (M2) encoding vector as a non-binding control. After 48h, transfected
HEK293T cells were incubated with methionine- and cysteine-free DMEM for 30 min at 37
°C. Cells were labelled with 10 mCi ml−1 [35S]-methionine/cysteine (1,175 Ci mmol−1;
PerkinElmer Life Sciences) at 37 °C for the indicated times and chased with DMEM at 37
°C for the indicated times. Cells were lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (50 mM Tris,
pH7.4, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 5 mM MgCl2, and 150 mM NaCl). Immunoprecipitations were
performed using 30 µl of anti-HA agarose (Roche) for 2 h at 4 °C with gentle agitation. For
enzymatic digestions, immunoprecipitates were denatured in glycoprotein denaturing buffer
(0.5% SDS, 1% 2-mercaptoethanol) at 95 °C for 5 min, followed by addition of sodium

(New England Biolabs) at 37 °C for 2 h. Immune complexes were eluted by boiling in
reducing sample buffer, subjected to SDS–PAGE (10%), and visualized by autoradiography.
Densitometric quantification of radioactivity was performed on a PhosphorImager (Fujifilm
BAS-2500) using Image Reader BAS-2500 V1.8 software (Fujifilm) and Multi Gauge V2.2
(Fujifilm) software for analysis. Quantification of human TIM-3 in pulse-chase metabolic
labelling was calculated by the following formula representing the average of 2–4 data sets:
(human TIM-3 signal intensity — M2 protein signal intensity/M2 protein signal intensity).
Transduction of primary human T cells with shRNA lentiviral vectors to silence human
TIM-3

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Lentiviral vectors encoding short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) (pLKO.1) targeting human TIM3
and a control shRNA targeting lacZ were obtained from the Dana Farber DNA Resource
Core. Lentiviral particles were produced as previously described36. Primary human CD4+ T
cells were transduced 3 days after stimulation and selected with 2 µg ml−1 puromycin
(Sigma) for 5 days followed by gradual increases of puromycin (5 µg ml−1) for the next 5
days and re-stimulated with anti-CD3 and CD28 for an additional 5 days. TIM3 shRNA1
(TRCN0000158033, 5′-C GTGGACCAAACTGAAGCTAT-3′); TIM3 shRNA 2
(TRCN0000154618, 5′-G CACTGAACTTAAACAGGCAT-3′); TIM3 shRNA 3
(TRCN0000157816, 5′-C AAATGCAGTAGCAGAGGGAA-3′); lacZ control knockdown
(TRCN0000072225; 5′-CTCTGGCTAACGGTACGCGTA-3′).
Transduction of primary mouse T cells with retroviral vectors
For transduction of mouse primary CD4+ T cells, previously described mouse TIM-3 and its
mutant expressing retroviruses were prepared in HEK293T cells using eco and gag/pol viral
envelope constructs (Clontech Inc.)17,37,38. Viral supernatants were collected 48h after
transfection and centrifuged and filtered with a 0.45-µm filters. CD4+ T cells were prepared
at 106 cells per ml in the presence of polybrene (Sigma; 8 mg ml−1). Viral particles and
CD4+ T cells were co-incubated by spin inoculation at 2,000g for 60 min on two sequential
days. To detect ectopic expression of the constructs in T cells, cells were allowed to rest for
3 days in 2 ng ml−1 IL-2 and sorted to obtain cells with the highest (45%) GFP expression.
Sorted cells were titrated into in vitro T-cell assays.

Galectin-9 induction of a poptosis
Naive CD4+ T cells were polarized under TH1 inducing conditions. In brief, naive CD4+ T
cells (2 × 106 per ml) were stimulated with plate-bound anti-CD3 specific antibodies (10 µg
ml−1) for 48 h. Soluble anti-CD28 antibodies (1 µg ml−1), recombinant (r) IL-2 (10 ng ml−1,
NIH) and blocking antibodies to IL-4 (10 µg ml−1) and rIL-12 (5 ng ml−1) were added and
the cells cultured for 7 days. Cells were washed and treated with galectin-9 (2 µg ml−1;
eBioscience) for 8 h to induce apoptosis. Apoptosis was detected by flow cytometry using
apoptosis staining kit (Roche) that stains for annexin V and propidium idodide.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Competent E. coli BL21 DE3 cells were transformed with a pET9a vector carrying a gene
insert coding for a single-chain of a protein consisting of the human CEACAM1 IgV
domain (residues 1–107), a 20 amino acid linker (4 repeats of a Gly-Gly-Gly-Gly-Ser
motif), and the human IgV domain of TIM-3 (residues 1–105) with a hexa-histidine tag
appended to the C terminus. To express the protein, trans-formants were grown in 1 litre of
LB broth under antibiotic selection and induced with 0.1 mM isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactoside
(IPTG) after reaching an absorbance at 600 nm (A600 nm) of approximately 0.8. Cells were
grown for an additional 16 hat 18 °C and collected by centrifugation. Protein was purified
from inclusion bodies, which were solubilized in a chaotropic buffer and refolded in a buffer
containing 200 mM Tris, pH 8.5, 0.4 M arginine-HCl, 2 mM EDTA, 5 mM cysteamine and
0.5 mM cystamine, as reported previously39. Refolded protein was loaded onto a Ni-NTA
affinity column and washed several times with a buffer containing 50 mM HEPES, pH7.5,
300 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM CaCl2, 10% glycerol and 10–30 mM imidazole. The protein was
eluted with 50 mM HEPES buffer, pH7.2, 300 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM CaCl2, 10% glycerol and
300 mM imidazole. Eluted protein fractions were analysed by SDS–PAGE, pooled,
concentrated and further purified with a Superdex 75 gel filtration column (GE Healthcare)
in a buffer containing 50 mM HEPES buffer, pH7.5, 200 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM CaCl2 and
10% glycerol. Circular dichroism was conducted to confirm proper protein folding. Purified
protein (purity >95%, estimated by SDS–PAGE) was concentrated to 2.5 mg ml−1 for
crystallization.
The initial crystal growth trials were performed by vapour diffusion using a Phoenix robotic
system (Art Robbins) with Index Screens 1 and 2 (Hampton Research) and optimized using
an additive screen (Hampton Research). Optimized crystals were formed in 4 µl drops (2 µl
protein, 2 µl mother liquor), equilibrated against a mother liquor containing 100 mM Tris 8.0
and 25% PEG 3350, at room temperature in a sitting drop setup. For data collection, crystals
were cryoprotected in solution containing 25% PEG 3350 and 12% glycerol. X-ray data
were collected using the X25 beamline at the National Synchrotron Light Source (NSLS).
The data were processed with Mosflm40 and the CCP4 software suite41.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

A crystallographic model of the single-chain human CEACAM1–TIM-3 protein was built
by a molecular replacement strategy using a search model made by modifying published
structures of the IgV (N) domain of human CEACAM1 (Protein Data Bank (PDB) code
2GK2) and mouse TIM-3 (PDB code 2OYP). Specifically, all residues were changed to
alanine to reduce model bias and all small molecule ligands, water and metals were
removed. Molecular replacement was performed with the program Molrep. Model building
and structural refinement were performed with the PHENIX software42 and COOT43,
respectively. Five per cent of the total reflection data were excluded from the refinement
cycles and used to calculate the free R factor (Rfree) for monitoring refinement progress.
Repeated rounds of model building and refinement with group B-factors refinement strategy
and Torsion-NCS restraints resulted in a final crystallographic Rwork/Rfree of 34.5%/37.3%
using all data to 3.4 Å resolution. The X-ray data and refinement statistics are shown in
Extended Data Table 2. Most of the residues were well defined and verified by PDB
validation report (data not shown). However, the β-strands associated with the hTIM-3 AB–

Competent E. coli BL21 DE3 cells were transformed with a pET9a vector carrying the
human CEACAM1 IgV domain gene insert with a N-terminal GST tag. To express the
protein, transformants were grown in 1 litre of LB broth under antibiotic selection and
induced with 0.1 mM IPTG after reaching an A600 nm of approximately 0.8. Cells were
grown for an additional 16 h at 18 °C and collected by centrifugation. Cell pellets were
suspended in 20 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 150 mM NaCl and 10% glycerol,
and lysed by sonication. After centrifugation, supernatant was loaded onto a GST column
(GE Healthcare) and washed several times with 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing
150 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM CaCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 10% glycerol. After on-column
removal of the GST affinity tag with thrombin, protein was eluted with 25 mM Tris-HCl
buffer, pH7.5, containing 200 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM CaCl2 and 10% glycerol. Eluted protein
fractions, as judged by SDS–PAGE, were concentrated and purified through a Superdex 75
gel filtration column (GE Healthcare) by FPLC system with a buffer containing 50 mM
Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 200 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM CaCl2 and 10% glycerol. A
single peak for human CEACAM1 IgV domain was collected and the protein was
concentrated to 5 mg ml−1 for crystallization. A purity of >95%, was verified by SDS–
PAGE.

The initial crystal growth trials were performed in a 96-well format using a Phoenix robotic
system (Art Robbins) with Index Screens 1 and 2 (Hampton Research) at room temperature.
Optimized crystals were formed in well solution containing 60% Tascimate, pH8, and 1% βoctyl glucoside at room temperature. For data collection, crystals were cryoprotected in
solution containing 60% Tascimate, pH8 and 18% glycerol. X-ray data were collected using
beamline X6A at the National Synchrotron Light Source (NSLS). The data were processed
with Mosflm40 and the CCP4 software suite41. The structure of the human CEACAM1 N
(IgV) domain was determined by the molecular replacement method using a modified Nterminal domain of human CEACAM1 as a search model (PDB code 2GK2) as the starting
model, with all residues changed to alanine to reduce model bias and all small molecule
ligands, water and metals were removed. Molecular replacement was performed with
Molrep, refinements were performed with PHENIX42 and intermittent model building was
performed with COOT43, as described above. Subsequent refinements cycles and model
building with individual B-factors and Torsion-NCS restraints strategy led to the final
crystallographic Rwork/Rfree of 20.3%/24.2% using all data to 2.0 Å resolution. Electron
densities were also identified for bound molecules of beta-octyl glucoside and malonic acid.
The X-ray data and structure refinement statistics are shown in Extended Data Table 2. All

Structural modelling of CEACAM1–TIM-3 interactions

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To model potential interactions between CEACAM1 and TIM-3, superimposition data as
shown in Extended Data Fig. 2d, e, of previously described immunoglobulin-variable (IgV)
domains of mouse CEACAM114 (PDB code 1L62) and mouse TIM-3 (PDB 2OYP)13 was
generated in Pymol (The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System, Schrödinger, LLC), which
revealed structural similarity as shown by a score of 2.42 by root mean square deviation
(r.m.s.d.) analysis as calculated by Pymol44. In addition, multiple sequence alignments were
performed using ClustalW45. From this analysis, we considered mouse CEACAM1 and
TIM-3 as structurally similar proteins. Furthermore, as previous structural data for mouse
CEACAM1 supported the formation of CEACAM1 homodimers between its N-terminal
domains14, and given our evidence that mouse CEACAM1 and TIM-3 are highly similar,
we further reasoned that mouse TIM-3 and its human orthologue might heterodimerize with
CEACAM1 through their membrane-distal N-terminal domains. This hypothesis was
modelled by us in the following manner. We aligned CEACAM1 symmetrically for cis
modelling and asymmetrically for trans modelling along the five amino acid residues within
the FG–CC′ loops of mTIM-3 as reported previously13 that describe putative docking sites
for an unknown ligand for mouse TIM-3. The ROSIE Docking Server was used to analyse
the docking (http://rosettadock.graylab.jhu.edu/documentation/docking)46,47. We identified
the ten best scoring structures from the run in rank order by energy. The top two in cis and
the best in trans are shown in Extended Data Fig. 2g. The score (y axis) indicates the energy
of the models (the lower the better). The r.m.s. (x axis) indicates the RMS values between
the input and output docking models. The docking models identified were further assessed
in PyMOL to determine whether the models identified predicted hydrogen bonding within
the putative mouse CEACAM1–TIM-3 interface. On the basis of this we identified potential
amino acids that may have an important role in mouse CEACAM1– TIM-3 binding, which
is summarized in the table associated with Extended Data Fig. 2g.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We used the amino acids of mouse CEACAM1 and mouse TIM-3 modelled at the interface
between these two proteins to predict potential contact sites for the human orthologues of
CEACAM1 and TIM-3. Furthermore, we searched human exomic databases for allelic
variants in these predicted human amino acids. Finally, we used all of this information to
make structural modifications of human CEACAM1 and TIM-3 by site-directed
mutagenesis to biochemically examine our hypothesis and confirm this by X-ray
crystallographic analysis of a human CEACAM1–TIM-3 single-chain protein.
IBD case-control samples and genotyping
German Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis patients were recruited at the Department of
General Internal Medicine of the Christian-Albrechts- University Kiel and Charité
Universitätsmedizin Berlin, or nationwide with the support of the German Crohn and Colitis
Foundation and the Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung (BMBF) competence
network ‘IBD’ (Extended Data Table 3a). The patients were classified according to clinical,
radiological, histological and endoscopic (that is, type and distribution of lesions) according

to accepted criteria48,49. Healthy control individuals were obtained from the popgen
biobank50. All controls were drawn from a population-representative sample. Given the low
prevalence of both Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis and the fact that all control
individuals self-reported to have neither Crohn’s disease nor ulcerative colitis, control
individuals were designated ‘healthy’. Written, informed consent was obtained from all
study participants and all protocols were approved by the institutional ethical review
committees of the participating centres. The variants described in Extended Data Table 3b
were genotyped using the Sequenom iPlex and the Life Technologies Taqman system.
rs147827860, the single nucleotide polymorphism encoding the hypomorphic Thr101Ile
allele of TIM3, is a rare variant with a minor allele frequency of 0.004 in individuals of
European descent predicting homozygous carriage with a frequency of 0.000016 (or
1:62,500). None of the publicly accessible databases lists any homozygous occurrences of
this variant. Association in the case-control data was tested with Haploview 4.2 (ref. 51). An
exact test for Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium was performed using the DeFinetti program
(Strom, T. M. & Wienker, T. F., http://ihg.gsf.de/cgi-bin/hw/hwa1.pl).
Purification of IgV domain of human TIM-3

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The TIM-3 IgV domain was expressed with a C-terminal GST tag as inclusion bodies from
pET9a in E. coli BL21 DE3 cells. Inclusion bodies were refolded as described previously in
refolding buffer containing 200 mM Tris, pH8.5, 0.4M arginine-HCl, 2 mM EDTA, 5 mM
cysteamine and 0.5 mM cystamine39. Refolded proteins were purified by affinity and gel
filtration chromatography. The proteins were maintained in a solution containing 25 mM
HEPES buffer, pH7.2, containing 200 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM CaCl2 and 5% glycerol. Circular
dichroism was conducted to ascertain proper protein folding. A purity of >95%, was verified
by SDS–PAGE.
GST protein pull-down assays

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Glutathione-S-transferase (GST) pull-down analyses52 of the interaction between IgV
domains of human TIM-3 and human CEACAM1 were performed in the following manner.
The GST–hTIM-3 protein was stored in refolding buffer, and buffer-exchanged with PBS
before performing the assay. The IgV domain of GST–hTIM-3 proteins were coupled to the
glutathione-agarose column following the manufacturer’s instructions (Thermo scientific)
and in-column-incubated with HEK293T cell lysates derived from cells transfected with
Flag-tagged human CEACAM1. The columns were washed extensively and bound proteins
were eluted by glutathione. Eluted protein complexes were immunoblotted for the detection
of CEACAM1 (immunoblot with anti-Flag) and TIM-3 (immunoblot with anti-GST).
TIM-3 ligand precipitation assays
Extracellular membrane-associated proteins on live TK-1 cells were labelled with biotin
(EZ-LinkSulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin; Pierce). Whole-cell lysates were prepared and were
incubated with 5 µg human IgG, full length TIM-3–Ig or soluble(s) TIM-3–Ig in the
presence of protein G–agarose beads (Roche). Beads were washed and boiled with 1×SDS–
PAGE loading buffer. Supernatants were collected by centrifugation, and half of each was
digested with PNGase F (New England Biolabs). Samples were separated by SDS–PAGE

Ceacam-4LTg Ceacam1−/−, Tim3Tg Ceacam1−/−, Tim3Tg Ceacam1+/+ (Tim3Tg/wild-type)
mice and CD4+ T cells were isolated using anti-CD4 (L3T4) MACS magnetic beads
(Miltenyi Biotec) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Enriched CD4+ T cells (94–
97% pure as estimated by FACS) were then labelled with PerCP-conjugated anti-CD4,
allophycocyanin-conjugated anti-CD44, and FITC-conjugated anti-CD62L and
phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-TIM-3 (5D12 or 2C12). Subpopulations of CD4+ T cells
were identified by three-colour sorting on a FACSAria (Becton Dickinson). All populations
were defined as naive and 98.0% pure on re-analysis. To induce chronic colitis in animals, 5
× 105 CD4+ CD44lo CD62Lhigh (naive) T cells were adoptively transferred intraperitoneally
into 6–10-week-old Ceacam1−/− Rag2−/− recipient mice. Weights were measured every
week, and mice were euthanized by CO2 for histological evaluation of colitis and lamina
propria mononuclear cells. Owing to the severity of colitis associated with adoptive transfer
of naive Ceacam1−/− CD4+ T cells, significant mortality was observed resulting in unequal
group size at the at the time of culling necessitating post-hoc correction in the statistical
analysis (see ‘statistical methods’).
Colorectal carcinogenesis models

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To examine the effect of CEACAM1 and TIM-3 on tumour incidence and multiplicity in an
inflammation induced colorectal cancer model, mice were intraperitoneally injected at 6
weeks of age with the carcinogen AOM (Sigma-Aldrich) at 10 mg kg−1 body weight as
previously reported54,55. One week later, the mice were started on the first of two 21-day
DSS cycles, consisting of a period of 7 days with the tumour promoter DSS at 2.5% or 1.5%
in the drinking water followed by 7 days of receiving regular water. Mice showing signs of
morbidity were culled. Colons were removed and flushed with PBS buffer and cut
longitudinally. Colon tissue sections were either paraffin-embedded for
immunohistochemistry or analysis of lamina propria mononuclear cells associated with the
tumours. CT26 colorectal carcinoma cells were diluted into 10 × 106 cells per ml of PBS.
After shaving, either wild-type or Ceacam1−/− mice received 200 µl of the CT26 cell
suspension subcutaneously in the left flank. All antibody treatments were applied
intraperitoneally into the right flank according to the schedules described in Extended Data.
Two-hundred micrograms of each antibody or its isotype control were administered
according to the schedules described (CEACAM1, cc1 clone; TIM-3 5D12 clone; PDL1,
10F.9G2) Tumour growth was assessed three times per week at 7 days after tumour
inoculation by measuring the width and length of the tumours (mm) using calipers and the
areas defined (mm2; width × length). Mice were euthanized on the basis of the extent of
tumour growth observed in the isotype antibody treated control animals to minimize animal
suffering in accordance with the approved animal protocol.

Histopathological examination of colitis and colitis-associated colorectal cancer

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Colons were removed from mice after termination and dissected free from the anus to the
caecum. Colonic contents were removed and colons cleaned with PBS before fixation in 4%
paraformaldyhyde or 10% neutral buffered formalin followed by routine paraffin
embedding. After paraffin embedding, 0.5-mm sections were cut and stained with
haematoxylin and eosin. Sections were examined and colitis was scored in a blinded fashion
(with respect to genotype and experimental protocol) by one of the authors (J.N.G.). Each of
four histological parameters for the severity of colitis was scored as absent (0), mild to
severe (1–6): mononuclear cell infiltration, polymorphonuclear cell infiltration, epithelial
hyperplasia, epithelial injury and extent of inflammation, modified from a previous study56.
For AOM/DSS, colitis-associated colorectal cancer studies, an expert pathologist (J.N.G.)
examined all tissues for dysplasia, adenoma, low-to-high-grade adenoma and
adenocarcinoma in a blinded fashion.
RNA, complementary DNA and quantitative PCR

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

RNA was isolated from whole cells using the Qiagen microRNA extraction kit following the
manufacturer’s instructions. RNA was quantified spectrophotometrically, and
complementary DNA was reverse-transcribed using the cDNA archival kit (Applied
Biosystems) following the manufacturer’s guidelines. All primers were obtained from
Applied Biosystem. The cDNA samples were subjected to 40 cycles of amplification in an
ABI Prism 7900 Sequence Detection System instrument according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. Quantification of relative messenger RNA expression was determined by the
comparative Ct (critical threshold) method as described whereby the amount of target
mRNA, normalized to endogenous cycles of amplification was determined by the formula
2−ΔΔCt.
Gene expression analyses by NanoString

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Naive T cells from wild-type, Tim3Tg and Tim3Tg Ceacam1−/− mice were transferred into
Ceacam1−/− Rag2−/− recipients to induce colitis. For the analyses of transcriptional
regulation, colonic infiltrating lamina propria mononuclear cells were isolated at 6 weeks
after T-cell transfer and immediately lysed in RLT buffer (Qiagen). For RNA analysis, 100
ng of total RNA was used and hybridized to a custom designed gene CodeSet (nonenzymatic RNA profiling using bar-coded fluorescent probes) according to the
manufacturers protocol (Nanostring Technologies). Barcodes were counted (1,150 fields of
view per sample) on an nCounter Digital Analyzer following the manufacturer’s protocol
(NanoString Technologies, Inc.).
Cytokine measurements
To measure cytokine production by ELISA, 1 × 105 CD4+ T cells were cultured in 200 µl
RPMI 1640 (Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS, 500 U ml−1
penicillin, 100 µg ml−1 streptomycin (Sigma-Aldrich), 10 mM HEPES, 1% nonessential
amino acids and 50 µM 2-mercaptoethanol (Life Technologies Invitrogen), which was
termed complete RPMI 1640, in the presence of 5 µg ml−1 plate-bound anti-CD3 and 2 µg
ml−1 soluble anti-CD28 monoclonal antibodies on flat-bottom 96-well plates (Costar), at 37

°C in a humidified atmosphere incubator containing 5% CO2 for 48 h or otherwise
indicated. Culture supernatants were removed and analysed for the production of cytokines
such as IFN-γ, IL-2 or TNF-α. Cytokine concentrations were determined using specific
ELISAs (R&D Systems) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. To measure
cytokine production by intracellular cytokine staining on colitis-associated CD4+ T cells
obtained from the dissection of mesenteric lymph nodes, lymph nodes or lamina propria
were incubated at 37 °C for 4–6 h incomplete RPMI 1640 medium with 50 ng ml−1 PMA
(Sigma-Aldrich), 500 ng ml−1 ionomycin (Sigma-Aldrich), and 1 µl ml−1 GolgiPlug (BD).
Surface staining was performed for 30 min, after which the cells were resuspended in
fixation/permeabilization solution (Cytofix/Cytoperm kit; BD). Intracellular cytokine
staining using antibodies as described earlier was performed according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. To measure cytokine production by intracellular cytokine staining in draining
lymph node CD4+ or CD8+ T cells derived from CT26-tumour bearing mice, cells were
stimulated with 5 µg ml−1 AH1-peptide (SPSYVYHQF) or tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes
(TIL) with 1 µg ml−1 plate-bound monoclonal antibody (mouse anti-CD3 antibody for 48 h).
The cells were counterstained with monoclonal antibody against CD8-FITC with or without
AH1-tetramer (Medical Biological Laboratories) which detects the MuLV gp70 peptide
(SPSYVYHQF) in the context of H-2Ld and analysed by flow cytometry.
Surface plasmon resonance

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Studies were performed on Biacore 3000 (GE Healthcare). GST–hTIM-3 protein, or GST
alone as control, was immobilized on a CM5 sensor chip using amine coupling chemistry as
per the manufacturer’s instructions. The coupling was performed by injecting 30 µg ml−1 of
protein into 10 mM sodium acetate, pH5.0 (GE Healthcare). HBS-EP buffer (0.01 M
HEPES, 0.15 M NaCl, 3 mM EDTA, 0.005% surfactant P20; GE Healthcare) was used as
running buffer and dilution buffer. Serial dilutions of analytes in HBS-EP were injected at
25 °C with a 25 µl min−1 flow rate and data collected over time. The surface was
regenerated between different dilutions with 10 mM glycine-HCl, pH2.5 (GE Healthcare).
For blockade of single-chain binding to GST–hTIM-3, single-chain hCEACAM1– hTIM-3
protein was injected alone or together with antibody (anti-human CEACAM1 monoclonal
antibody, 26H7) or TIM-3-specific peptide (residues 58–77, 58-CPV
FECGNVVLRTDERDVNY-77) with IgG1 mouse antibody or scrambled peptide
(TLCVCFVNPYDVRVNDEREG) used as controls, respectively. All data were zero
adjusted, and the reference cell value was subtracted.
Isolation of lamina propia mononuclear cells and TILs
Colonic lamina propria mononuclear cells, colonic polyp-derived TILs and subcutaneous
CT26 derived TILs were isolated as follows. Total colons from each group were
longitudinally cut and washed with HBSS (free of Ca2+ and Mg2+) to remove faeces and
debris. Subcutaneous CT26 tumours were dissected and dissociated in a gentle MACS
dissociator (Miltenyi Biotec). Tumours, tumour-free colon pieces and CT26 tumour pieces
were further finely minced and incubated in HBSS containing5 mM EDTA, 0.145 mg ml−1
dithiothreitol, 1 M HEPES, 10% FBS, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin at 37 °C for 15 min
for two cycles to dissociate the epithelial monolayers. EDTA was then removed by three
washes in HBSS. The colon tissue and tumour specimens then were digested in RPMI 1640

containing 0.4 mg ml−1 collagenase D (Roche) and 0.01 mg ml−1 DNase I (Roche) for 20
min (tumour-free colon pieces) or 30 min (tumour pieces) at 37 °C on a shaking platform
and further digested with collagenase IV (Roche) at 0.01 mg ml−1 DNase I (Roche) for 20
min (tumour-free colon pieces) or 30 min (tumour pieces) at 37 °C on a shaking platform.
After enzymatic treatment, digested tissue was passed through a 70-µm cell strainer and the
flow-through medium containing the mononuclear cells was collected and centrifuged at
400g for10 min and pelleted and subjected to a 40:80% Percoll (GE Healthcare) gradient
followed by centrifugation for 20 min at 2,500 r.p.m. at room temperature. Lamina propria
mononuclear cells or TILs were collected at the interphase of the gradient, washed once, and
resuspended in RPMI 1640 complete medium for further analyses.
Statistical methods

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Standard two-tailed t-test was applied throughout except for the following exceptions. A
Welch t-test was applied in the setting of unequal variance. The Mann–Whitney U test was
applied when data were demonstrated to not follow a Gaussian distribution. In experiments
where more than two groups were compared, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was
performed followed by application of post-hoc correction using Bonferroni’s multiple
comparison test or Dunnett’s correction followed by Friedman test. Kruskal–Wallis with
post-hoc Dunn’s correction was used in making multiple comparisons of groups with
unequal size. Comparisons of mortality were made by Kaplan–Meier survival curve analysis
with log-rank test to assess differences in cancer survival. Pearson’s coefficient for
correlation (r) test was performed for comparison of variables. GraphPad Prism version 5.0b
was used for calculations. P values of 0.05 were considered significant.

a, hTIM-3 primers, b, hCEACAM1 primers. Mutations were chosen on the basis of orthologous human residues reported
previously13 in mTIM-3 as involved in non-galectin-9 interactions with an unknown ligand (hTIM-3 residues 1,4,6,10 and
11 in a); orthologous human residues in hCEACAM1 (hCEACAM1 residues 1,4, 5 and 6 in b) predicted to be involved in
mTIM-3 interactions on the basis of studies described in Extended Data Fig. 2g and Supplementary Information; natural
allelic variants of amino acid residues in hTIM-3 (residues 3, 7 and 10 in a) and hCEACAM1 (1, 4 and 6 in b) described
above or others (hTIM-3 residue 7 in a), which were extracted from human exomic databases. Amino acid residues
predicted to be involved in hTIM-3 (IgV)-hCEACAM1 (IgV) interactions on the basis of X-ray crystallographic structural
models (hCEACAM1 residues 2 and 3 in b) as described in Supplementary Information, and cysteine residues involved in
intrachain disulphide bonds adjacent to the CC’ and FG loops of hTIM-3 (Cys 58-Cys 109, Cys52-Cys63 and Cys3S-Cys
110) as described in Supplementary Information.

Genotype distribution for 11 TIM3 variants in CD, UC and IBD patients and healthy controls. A specifies the major, B the
minor allele.
a, Number of successfully genotyped German patients and controls and corresponding distribution of genotypes for the
Thr101Ile missense variant in TIM3, including the genotype distribution in individuals of European descent (European
Americans) downloaded from the Exome Variant Server (EVS), NHLBI GO Exome Sequencing Project (http://
evs.gs.washington.edu/EVS/). Genotyping 11 rare variants in TIM3, in a cohort of 5,634 inflammatory bowel disease and
3,940 control subjects, we observed homozygous rs147827860 (Thr101Ile) carriage exclusively in three IBD subjects (2
Crohn’s disease (CD) and 1 ulcerative colitis (UC)), but no control subjects which significantly deviated from Hardy–
Weinberg equilibrium in IBD cases (P = 0.0033) but not controls (P = 1.00). b, Description of TIM3 single nucleotide
