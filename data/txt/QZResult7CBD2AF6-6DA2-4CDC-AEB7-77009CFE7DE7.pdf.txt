BACKGROUND: Radiation exposure is an established cause of clinical thyroid cancer, but little is known about radiation
effects on papillary microcarcinoma (PMC) of the thyroid, a relatively common subclinical thyroid malignancy. Because the
incidence of these small thyroid cancers has been increasing, it is important to better understand them and their relation
to radiation. METHODS: PMCs were identified in a subset of 7659 members of the Life Span Study of atomic bomb survivors who had archived autopsy or surgical materials. We conducted a pathology review of these specimens and evaluated
the histological features of the tumors and the association between PMCs and thyroid radiation dose. RESULTS: From
1958 to 1995, 458 PMCs were detected among 313 study subjects. The majority of cancers exhibited pathologic features of
papillary thyroid cancers. Overall, 81% of the PMCs were of the sclerosing variant and 91% were nonencapsulated, psammoma bodies that occurred in 13% and calcification was observed in 23%. Over 95% had papillary or papillary-follicular
architecture and most displayed nuclear overlap, clear nuclei, and nuclear grooves. Several of these features increased
with increasing tumor size, but no association was found with radiation dose. A significant radiation-dose response was
found for the prevalence of PMCs (estimated excess odds ratio/Gy ¼ 0.57; 95% confidence interval, 0.01-1.55), with the
excess risk observed primarily among women. CONCLUSIONS: Exposure to low-to-moderate doses of ionizing radiation
appears to increase the risk of thyroid PMCs, even when exposure occurs during adulthood. Cancer 2010;116:1646–55.

In parallel with the growing use of thyroid ultrasound, there has been an increase in the diagnosis of thyroid cancers, espe-

cially papillary microcarcinomas (PMC) in Japan1 and other developed countries.2-6 PMC is defined by the World Health
Organization as a tumor of 1 cm or less in diameter that is discovered incidentally.7 PMCs are frequently clinically indolent and are often detected incidentally during surgery for benign thyroid disease or at autopsy, but there have been
numerous reports of local lymph node invasion and distant metastases.8-10 The inconsistent findings have resulted in controversy regarding treatment and the precise relationship of PMC with clinical papillary carcinoma of the thyroid.11
Radiation is a known cause of thyroid cancer, and papillary carcinoma is the principal thyroid cancer cell type linked
to radiation, especially after childhood exposure.12 The radiation-related risk of clinical thyroid cancer and risk modification by age and other factors have been well characterized.12,13 Little is known, however, about the association between
radiation exposure and PMC.
This study was undertaken to characterize histological features of PMCs, with special emphasis on their relation to
tumor size, and to assess the relationship of PMC and radiation exposure among a subgroup of members of the Life Span

Study (LSS) of atomic bomb survivors using DS02 thyroid organ dose estimates.14 The study is part of a broader
effort by pathologists to ascertain and histologically verify
benign and malignant thyroid tumors in the LSS.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Population and Papillary
Microcarcinoma Cases
The LSS cohort, described in detail elsewhere,15 comprises 93,000 atomic bomb survivors from Hiroshima
and Nagasaki and 27,000 city residents who were not
present in the cities at the time of the bombings. PMCs
were ascertained from 1958 through 1995 among the subcohort of 7659 LSS members with autopsy or surgical pathology records available at Radiation Effects Research
Foundation (RERF) or who had tissue samples in the Hiroshima and Nagasaki tissue registries (Table 1). To identify other cancers occurring in these subjects, we linked
the study file to the Hiroshima and Nagasaki tumor registries.16 We restricted the study period to 1958 through
1995 because the tumor registries were established in
1958 and there was a marked decline in number of
autopsies carried out after 1995 (only 20 per year).
LSS autopsy program

The primary source for ascertaining PMCs was the
autopsy program conducted in the LSS cohort by the
Atomic Bomb Casualty Commission (ABCC) and its successor the RERF. This program was most active from
1958 through 1988, during which time extensive efforts
were made to conduct autopsies on as many deceased
members of the LSS as possible. Autopsy rates were the
highest in the 1960s, ranging from to 30% to 40%, but

Cancer

the rates declined thereafter and by the late 1970s,
autopsies were conducted on only 10% of deceased cohort
members.17 Before 1961, autopsies were performed on
deceased subjects referred by local physicians and hospitals, and the selection for autopsy reflected ABCC’s
research interests, especially malignancies. In 1961, the
autopsy program was revised and expanded to obtain a
more representative distribution of causes of deaths using
a community-based network for prompt identification of
LSS cohort member deaths, which was based on information from numerous sources, including major hospitals,
city registration offices, local funeral homes and
crematories.18,19
Between 1958 and 1988, 4718 deceased LSS subjects were autopsied at ABCC/RERF by staff pathologists
after the standardized ‘‘complete’’ autopsy protocol, in
which all the major organs, including the thyroid, were
examined. In complete autopsies, the entire thyroid gland
was removed, inspected, and palpated. When a tumor (or
nodule) was suspected, sections were made from each
nodule for further microscopic examination. When there
were no nodules, slides representing the tissue structure
were made from each of the lobes and the isthmus.
Between 1958 and 1995, autopsies on 2893 LSS
subjects were performed outside ABCC/RERF.19,20 For
these so-called ‘‘partial’’ autopsies, representative tissues
and slides were sent to ABCC/RERF.
Surgical pathology and tissue registries

PMCs were also identified from the ABCC/RERF
surgical-pathology program, which was active from the
late 1950s through the late 1960s. The tissue registries,
started in 1973, are repositories of tissue specimens and

1647

blocks sent from local hospitals and pathology laboratories. These registries were used for identifying thyroid
microcarcinomas.
Pathology review

First, trained tumor registry staff examined all autopsy and surgical pathology diagnoses for LSS members
and identified diagnoses of ‘‘latent,’’ ‘‘occult,’’ or ‘‘microcarcinoma’’ of the thyroid. Two study pathologists (YH
and NT) then independently reviewed all thyroid tissue
slides and pathology records available for these potential
cases. When the 2 pathologists did not agree on histological features or diagnosis, they met to review the materials
and reach a consensus diagnosis. By using the World
Health Organization (WHO) classification, PMCs were
defined as thyroid carcinomas 1 cm or less in diameter.7
Multifocal (synchronous) PMCs in the same person were
treated separately for analyses of pathomorphologic features of PMC. For the radiation risk analysis, only the
largest tumor was considered. No new slides were cut for
detecting PMCs; however, when multiple slides were
available, they were all reviewed. The number of slides
reviewed per person ranged from 1 to 35 with a mean of
5.3 and a median of 3.
Radiation Dose Estimates
DS0214 weighted thyroid doses in Gy were defined as the
gamma dose estimate plus 10 times the neutron dose estimate. These estimates incorporate an adjustment to
reduce risk estimation bias arising from random errors in
individual dose estimates. This adjustment was computed
using the methods described in Pierce et al21 with the
assumption of a coefficient of variation of 35% for individual estimates.
Statistical Analyses
Descriptive analyses of tumor characteristics were based
on the 7659 LSS members in the study population and
the PMCs identified between 1958 and 1995 from any
data sources. Trend tests were performed to evaluate the
relationship between histopathological features and tumor
sizes.
Analyses of radiation dose response were restricted
to a subset of the study population: LSS members who
had completed autopsies performed at ABCC/RERF
between 1958 and 1988 were in the city at the time of the
bombs, had DS02 thyroid dose estimates, and did not
have a cancer reported from the tumor registries before
death. Only complete autopsies were included in the anal-

1648

ysis because the thyroid gland was not always thoroughly
examined in partial autopsies. Most analyses were limited
to first primary PMCs because second or later primary
tumors 1) may be intrathyroidal metastases from larger,
clinically evident thyroid carcinomas, 2) may have
resulted from cancer treatment given for an earlier cancer,
and 3) may have reflected biased ascertainment because
individuals with cancer were more likely to have been
autopsied than others.
Prevalence odds ratios (ORs) were estimated for
PMCs. Categorical descriptions of the dose response
were based on thyroid dose categories of 5-99, 100-499,
and 500þ mGy relative to the risk for subjects with
thyroid dose estimates of <5 mGy. The odds of PMC
occurrence were described using logistic regression models with effects of sex and age at death. Adjusting for
age at exposure, calendar time, and city had no significant effect on the rates and did not markedly affect the
radiation risk estimates. The excess OR per Gy (excessive OR/Gy) was estimated assuming a linear doseresponse relationship. Sex, age at exposure, attained age,
and, when applicable, prior history of malignancy were
considered as potential effect modifiers. All 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were based on likelihood ratio
bounds for the parameter estimates. The risk analyses
were performed using the EPICURE software (Beverly
Hills, Calif).22

RESULTS
During the study period, 458 PMCs occurred among 313
subjects (Table 1). The number of PMCs per subject varied from 1 to 9: 238 subjects (76%) had single tumors, 59
subjects (19%) had 2 or 3 tumors, and the remaining 16
subjects (5%) had 5 or more tumors. The majority (378
or 82%) of the PMCs were identified from autopsies conducted between 1958 and 1988; 300 were diagnosed
from complete autopsies and 78 from partial autopsies. In
addition, 13 PMCs were identified from partial autopsies
done outside ABCC/RERF after 1988. The ABCC/
RERF surgical program during 1958-1972 and the Hiroshima and Nagasaki tissue registries after 1973 contributed 67 additional PMCs.

possible role of intrasubject correlations in subjects with
multiple tumors, we also present the 313 subjects who
had a PMC (cases), with the largest tumor selected as the
representative PMC (lower panel).
About 24% of the 458 PMCs were 1 mm in diameter, 52% were 1.1-5 mm in diameter, and another 24%
were 5.1-10 mm in diameter. The majority of PMCs
exhibited classical pathologic features of papillary thyroid
carcinoma. Overall, 81% of the microcarcinomas were of
the sclerosing variant and only 9% were encapsulated.
Because these were independent effects, the joint effects
are the product of the 2 effects, eg, 73% were nonencapsulated sclerosing tumors and 8% were encapsulated sclerosing tumors. The majority of PMCs had papillary
architecture. Only 16 PMCs (3%) were follicular variants
without any apparent papillary structure, although nuclear findings characteristic of papillary carcinoma, such
as ground-glass appearance, remarkable nuclear grooves,
and frequent nuclear inclusions, were often recognizable
in these cancers. Psammoma bodies occurred in 13% of
the papillary microcarcinomas and calcification was
observed in 23%.
Several pathological features of microcarcinomas
were associated with tumor size. As tumor size increased,
the proportion of encapsulated and sclerosing tumors
increased (Ptrend ¼.02 and <.001, respectively). While
fairly rare, the frequencies of psammoma bodies and calcification also rose with increasing tumor size (Ptrend ¼
<.001 for each variable). Among nuclear features examined, about 95% of all tumors showed evidence of nuclear
overlapping and clear nuclei, whereas 89% showed evidence of nuclear groove. The frequency distributions did
not vary with tumor size. In contrast, only 47% of the
PMC had nuclear inclusion bodies, but the frequency
increased with increasing tumor size (Ptrend<.001). The

1650

distribution of tumor size differed by sex with women
having larger tumors than men, so that the F:M ratio
increased from 1.3 for the smallest tumors to 3.2 for the
largest tumors. No significant difference in tumor size was
observed by age at death.
As seen in the lower panel of Table 2, the results for
the 313 subjects with independent PMCs were very similar to those for all PMCs, but the difference in the tumor
size distribution between male and women was not statistically significant.
When we evaluated the dependence of the number
of tumors, morphologic features, or tumor sizes on radiation dose (Table 3), we found no evidence of significant
relations (P ¼ .4, P ¼ .6, and P>.5, respectively).
As would be expected, the number of PMCs
detected per person tended to increase with the number of
slides examined. There was a significant association (R2 ¼
0.16, P<.001) between thyroid dose and the number of
slides examined. This correlation arose largely because the
3 cases with the largest number of slides examined (20
slides, 21 slides, and 25 slides with 7 PMCs, 3 PMCs, and
1 PMC, respectively) had 3 of the 5 highest doses among
the cases (2.5 Gy, 3.4 Gy, and 1.7 Gy). When these 3
extreme cases were removed, there was no significant correlation (R2 ¼ 0.08, P ¼ .4) between thyroid dose and the
number of slides. Although this association raises the possibility of biased selection, we believe this is unlikely
because the pathologists performing the autopsies were
unaware of the subjects’ distance from the hypocenter or
dose estimate and had no particular interest in thyroid
tissue.
Radiation Effects
We restricted the radiation risk analyses to complete
autopsies performed at ABCC/RERF during 1958-1988.

Among the 4718 LSS members, 196 had 300 PMCs (Table 1). There were 149 PMC cases of the 3523 subjects
who were in the city at the time of the bombs with thyroid
dose estimates. We excluded subjects with a prior cancer,
leaving 2372 subjects, among whom 106 (68 women and
38 men) had a PMC detected at autopsy resulting in a
prevalence of 4.5%.
The prevalence by city and other demographic variables (Table 4) showed a slightly higher occurrence in Hiroshima (4.6%) than Nagasaki (3.9%) and among women
(5.5%) than men (3.4%). Because the autopsied subjects
were deceased, the majority of them (84%) were older
than 60 years. Because complete autopsies at ABCC/
RERF were carried out during the 30-year period of 1958
through 1988, subjects tended to be exposed to the bombs
at relatively old ages and few (9%) were exposed <30
years. The prevalence of PMC by age at exposure ranged
from 2.1% to 6.1% and by age at death from 3.0% to 5.4
%, with no apparent age trends. Although the number of
autopsies decreased dramatically overtime, PMC prevalence was the same during the first 2 decades of the autopsy program.
Table 5 presents estimated ORs, adjusted for city,
sex, age at exposure, age at death, and calendar time, for
first primary PMC by thyroid dose. The OR estimates
increased significantly with increasing dose. The estimated
excessive OR/Gy was 0.57 (95% CI, 0.01-1.55). Although
the 106 cases considered in this analysis had no prior his-

tory of malignant tumor or other malignancies diagnosed
only at autopsy, 1 case had a diagnosis of a benign thyroid
disease before death. If the presence of the benign thyroid
tumor was considered (though unlikely) to have increased
a chance of discovering the PMC, then omitting this
case (thyroid dose ¼ 3.2 Gy) reduced the excessive OR/
Gy estimate to 0.45 (95% CI, 0.09-1.38; P ¼ .11).
Results for all 149 PMCs did not differ from those for the
106 first primaries. By using the same adjustment variables
and including a history of prior malignancy as an effect
modifier, the excessive OR/Gy was 0.59 (95% CI, 0.021.58).
Because of the small number of cases and the limited
age-at-exposure range, analyses of effect modifiers were
not very powerful and there was no evidence of age at exposure (P ¼ .4) or attained age (P>.5) effects on the excessive OR. Significant sex effects were noted and the fit
of the linear dose-response model was improved significantly when the excessive OR was allowed to depend on
sex (P ¼ .01). There was no indication of a radiation effect
among men (excessive OR/Gy ¼ -0.3; 95% CI, upper
boundary,1.4; P ¼ .23), whereas for women, it was quite
large (excessive OR/Gy ¼ 2.4; 95% CI, 0.3-4.5, P ¼
.002). Under the model that assumed no sex difference,
the estimated numbers of radiation-associated PMCs
were 2.2 for men and 2.6 for women. When separate
effects were estimated, the corresponding numbers of
excess cases were 3.2 and 10.2. The dose category-

DISCUSSION
About 75% of PMCs were nonencapsulated sclerosing
tumors. Nonencapsulated sclerosing tumors were also the
most common type (44%), though less frequent than
ours, in another autopsy study in Japan.23 The prevalence

1652

of nonencapsulated tumors decreased as tumor size
increased, whereas the frequencies of sclerosing tumors
increased with increasing tumor size, as did frequencies of
psammoma bodies, calcification, and nuclear inclusion
bodies. In a Brazilian study, the smallest papillary carcinomas presented most frequently as nonencapsulated and
nonsclerosing tumors.24
Among the atomic bomb survivors, thyroid cancer
was one of earliest solid cancers linked to radiation

exposure.25-30 Studies of clinically undetected (‘‘occult’’)
carcinoma of the thyroid were first conducted by Sampson et al, who ascertained carcinomas with a diameter of
<15 mm in serial sections of the thyroid from over 3000
consecutive autopsies conducted in the LSS cohort during 1957-1968.31 A radiation effect was suggested for the
smallest papillary carcinomas (<1 mm in diameter).32
Because this was a special study and could possibly bias
the results, we did not include these slides in the present
study. The frequency of ‘‘occult’’ carcinoma found by
Sampson et al31 was about 17%. This is much higher
than that of around 3%-6% (or about 4%) in the present
study, and it seems to reflect the serial sectioning methods
used by Sampson et al.32 In a later study of autopsies performed between 1951 and 1985 in Hiroshima LSS subjects, occult carcinoma (<15 mm in diameter) was
found, without serial section, in about 3% of the subjects.33 In that study, a significant increase in radiationrelated odds ratio was found for occult carcinoma of the
thyroid. In neither of these studies, however, were the
analyses restricted to first primary tumors, as they were in
the present study.
We found no significant relation among the numbers, sizes, or morphologic features of PMC and radiation dose. In evaluating the radiation effects on PMC,
we restricted the analyses to first primary PMCs, minimizing the possible effects of intrathyroid metastases
from larger papillary carcinomas of the thyroid or other
organs, potential ascertainment bias in cancer patients,
and possible treatment effects for previous cancers. This
strictly defined study endpoint was possible because of
the availability of data from complete autopsies conducted at RERF using the same protocol. A limitation
of this study was that the number of PMCs detected at
autopsy was related to the number of the thyroid gland
slices made, but we believe that using only 1 PMC per
person diminished the confounding effect of this association. Because a standard autopsy protocol was used for
the complete autopsies conducted at ABCC/RERF,
there will not be a bias in the dose response; however,
the absolute number of PMCs depends on the autopsy
method and, therefore, it is difficult to compare the
prevalence of PMCs in one study population with
another.
Although young age at exposure is an important
effect modifier for the radiation-related risk of thyroid
cancer, there may also be some risk associated with adult
exposure. In an analysis of thyroid cancer clinically diagnosed between 1958 and 1998 in the LSS cohort, the

Cancer

excess relative risk per Gy (excess RR/Gy) was estimated
to be 0.6 for survivors exposed at age 30.16 This estimate
is comparable to the excess OR/Gy of 0.57 for PMC
estimated from this study. In a new analysis of all survivors who were 20 years old at the bombings, the excess
RR/Gy was 0.70 (95% CI, 0.20-1.5) for women and
was 0.25 (95% CI, <0-0.35) for men.34 A large sex
difference was also observed in our study of autopsydetected PMCs. Radiation-related risks of thyroid cancer
have also been observed among adult patients treated
with radiation for benign conditions of the cervical
spine35 and for cancer. Studies of a second thyroid cancer among adult cancer patients receiving radiotherapy
have generally been limited by methodological problems,
eg, small number of second cancers in the radiotherapy
group, incomplete information regarding all treatments,
lack of thyroid doses, and comparisons made to the general population rather than between irradiated and nonirradiated patients. Evaluations of breast cancer patients
have been somewhat more informative because they often have addressed the issue of the potential role of
radiotherapy in the development of second primary thyroid cancers. Huang et al36 reported an elevated risk of
thyroid cancer in a subgroup of breast cancer patients
who were thought to have received particularly high
doses to the thyroid; however, this relationship was not
found in other studies of breast cancer patients.37-39
To our knowledge, this is among the largest radiation-exposed populations in which nonclinically detected
tumors were identified, yet the number of first primary
PMCs available for study of radiation effects was relatively small. The radiation dose response, though significant, was still susceptible to assumptions on case
eligibility. Our findings of a higher excessive OR for
women with no indication of a radiation effect for men
and of a statistically significant radiation dose response
for PMC, even when exposure occurred during adulthood, are provocative and should be investigated in a
larger study.
In summary, the PMCs were primarily nonencapsulated sclerosing tumors, and the majority of them
exhibited classical pathologic features of papillary thyroid cancer. The female-to-male ratio of PMC increased
with increasing tumor size so that for tumors >5 mm,
the ratio reached 3-fold, which is similar to what is
found for clinically detected papillary thyroid cancer.
Adult exposure to low-to-moderate doses of ionizing
radiation appears to increase the risk of thyroid PMCs
detected at autopsy.
