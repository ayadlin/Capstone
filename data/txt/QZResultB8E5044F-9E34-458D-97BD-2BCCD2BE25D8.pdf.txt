Abstract
The mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 kinase (mTORC1) is a central regulator of cell
growth that responds to diverse environmental signals and is deregulated in many human diseases,
including cancer and epilepsy1–3. Amino acids are a key input, and act through the Rag GTPases
to promote the translocation of mTORC1 to the lysosomal surface, its site of activation4. Multiple
protein complexes regulate the Rag GTPases in response to amino acids, including GATOR1, a
GTPase activating protein for RagA, and GATOR2, a positive regulator of unknown molecular
function. Here, we identify a four-membered protein complex (KICSTOR) composed of the
KPTN, ITFG2, C12orf66, and SZT2 gene products as required for amino acid or glucose

deprivation to inhibit mTORC1 in cultured cells. In mice lacking SZT2, mTORC1 signaling is
increased in several tissues, including in neurons in the brain. KICSTOR localizes to lysosomes;
binds to GATOR1 and recruits it, but not GATOR2, to the lysosomal surface; and is necessary for
the interaction of GATOR1 with its substrates, the Rag GTPases, and with GATOR2. Interestingly,
several KICSTOR components are mutated in neurological diseases associated with mutations that
lead to hyperactive mTORC1 signaling5–10. Thus, KICSTOR is a lysosome-associated negative
regulator of mTORC1 signaling that, like GATOR1, is mutated in human disease11,12.

To search for GATOR1-interacting proteins that may have escaped prior identification, we
used the CRISPR/Cas9 system to engineer the DEPDC5 gene in HEK-293T cells to express
a FLAG-tagged version of DEPDC5, a GATOR1 component, at endogenous levels. Mass
spectrometric analysis of FLAG-immunoprecipitates prepared from these cells revealed the
presence of GATOR2, as well as four proteins of unknown function encoded by the KPTN,
ITFG2, C12orf66, and SZT2 genes and of predicted molecular weights of 48, 49, 50, and
380 kDa, respectively (Fig. 1a). As shown below, these proteins form a complex, which we
named KICSTOR for KPTN, ITFG2, C12orf66, and SZT2-containing regulator of
mTORC1. KICSTOR components are conserved in vertebrates but not fungi (Fig. 1b). Some
non-vertebrates, like Caenorhabditis elegans, encode homologues of SZT2 but not of KPTN,
ITFG2, or C12orf66, while others, including Drosophila melanogaster, lack all four
KICSTOR components (Fig. 1b).

Author Manuscript

Endogenous KICSTOR was present in anti-FLAG immunoprecipitates prepared from cells
expressing endogenously FLAG-tagged DEPDC5 or WDR59, a GATOR2 component
(Extended Data Fig. 1a, b). Importantly, an anti-KPTN antibody co-immunoprecipitated
SZT2, ITFG2, and C12orf66, as well as GATOR1 and GATOR2 components (Extended
Data Fig. 1c). Amino acid starvation and stimulation of cells did not significantly affect the
interactions between any complex components (Extended Data Fig. 1a, b, c). Thus,
GATOR1 and GATOR2 associate with KICSTOR in an amino acid insensitive fashion.

Author Manuscript

Using HEK-293T cells transiently expressing recombinant versions of the KICSTOR
components, we explored how they interact with each other. KPTN and ITFG2 associated
even in the absence of the co-expression of either C12orf66 or SZT2 (Extended Data Fig.
1d), suggesting that they form a heterodimer on their own. Indeed, KPTN and ITFG2
associated in cells deficient for SZT2 or C12orf66, and loss of ITFG2 severely reduced
KPTN levels and vice versa (Extended Data Fig. 1e, f, g). The KPTN-ITFG2 heterodimer
co-immunoprecipitated C12orf66 only when SZT2 was also expressed and did not compete
with C12orf66 for interacting with SZT2 (Extended Data Fig. 1d, h). In size-exclusion
chromatography analyses of cell lysates, C12orf66, KPTN, and ITFG2 fractionated into two
main pools, one that co-migrated at a very high molecular weight with SZT2 and was absent
in SZT2-deficient cells, and a more abundant pool that migrated at lower molecular weights
(Extended Data Fig. 2). Collectively, these results suggest that the four KICSTOR proteins
form a large complex in which SZT2 serves as the link between the other three.
We readily detected endogenous KICSTOR in anti-FLAG immunoprecipitates from
HEK-293E cells stably expressing FLAG-tagged Nprl2, a GATOR1 component, but FLAGtagged WDR24, a GATOR2 component, co-immunoprecipitated much lower amounts of

KICSTOR (Fig. 1c). Consistent with the GATOR2-KICSTOR association being indirect,
loss of GATOR1 strongly reduced it (Fig. 1d), while that of GATOR2 did not significantly
affect the GATOR1-KICSTOR interaction (Fig. 1e). SZT2 co-immunoprecipitated with
GATOR1 even in cells lacking other KICSTOR components (Extended Data Fig. 3a) and
was required for GATOR1 or GATOR2 to co-immunoprecipitate the KPTN-ITFG2
heterodimer (Extended Data Fig. 3b). Moreover, KPTN-ITFG2, C12orf66, and GATOR1 coimmunoprecipitated three fragments of the 380 kDa SZT2 to different extents and the
integrity of KICSTOR did not depend on either GATOR complex (Extended Data Fig. 3c, d,
e, f). Altogether, these results suggest that KICSTOR is a distinct four-protein complex that
uses its SZT2 component to interact with GATOR1, which in turn binds to GATOR2 (Fig.
1f). Consistent with this model, the very high molecular weight pool of Nprl3 detected by
size-exclusion chromatography was absent in SZT2-deficient cells (Extended Data Fig. 2).

Because much of the nutrient sensing machinery upstream of mTORC1, including the Rag
GTPases, localizes to the lysosomal surface4,13, we asked if KICSTOR is also there. Indeed,
examination of HeLa cells expressing GFP-tagged ITFG2 (as a marker of KICSTOR) at
levels 2–3 fold above the endogenous protein, revealed that KICSTOR localizes, at least in
part, to lysosomes in an amino acid-insensitive fashion (Fig. 1g, and Extended Data Fig. 4a,
b). The GATOR complexes have been reported to localize to the lysosome14–17, which we
confirmed in HeLa cells stably expressing GFP-tagged components of GATOR1 (Nprl2) or
GATOR2 (Mios and WDR24) (Fig. 1h, i and Extended Data Fig. 4a, b, c). Consistent with
these results, amino acids did not affect the amounts of endogenous GATOR1, GATOR2, or
KICSTOR present on immunopurified lysosomes, but, as expected, did regulate that of
mTORC1 (Extended Data Fig. 4d). The lysosomes were not contaminated with
mitochondria, Golgi, ER, or peroxisomes (Extended Data Fig. 4d).

Author Manuscript

Given the strong interaction between KICSTOR and GATOR1, an inhibitor of the Rag
GTPases, we reasoned that KICSTOR might be required for the control of the mTORC1
pathway by amino acids. Indeed, in HEK-293T cells lacking any KICSTOR subunit, amino
acid deprivation did not inhibit mTORC1 signaling, as detected by the phosphorylation of
S6K1, 4E-BP1, and ULK1, or induce autophagy (Fig. 2a, b and Extended Data Fig. 1e and
5a, b, c). In HeLa cells loss of either SZT2 or ITFG2 had similar effects on S6K1
phosphorylation (Extended Data Fig. 5d, e, f). Although less is known about how glucose is
sensed upstream of the Rag GTPases18,19, loss of any KICSTOR component in HEK-293T
cells also rendered mTORC1 signaling insensitive to glucose starvation (Fig. 2c). Glucose
did not affect the lysosomal localization of GATOR1 and serum deprivation and insulin
stimulation still regulated mTORC1 in HeLa cells lacking KICSTOR components (Extended
Data Fig. 5g, h, i, j).

Author Manuscript

To determine if KICSTOR also inhibits mTORC1 signaling in vivo we analyzed previously
generated mice in which the Szt2 gene was disrupted by a gene trap (Szt2GT/GT)20.
Compared to wild-type littermates, mTORC1 signaling was increased in the liver and
skeletal muscle of fasted Szt2 gene trap mice as assessed by the phosphorylation of S6, a
substrate of S6K1, and of 4E-BP1 (Fig. 2d, e and Extended Data Fig. 6a, b).
Immunohistochemical detection of phospho-S6 in tissue slices from the brain as well as liver
and heart revealed increases in mTORC1 signaling in cerebellar and cortical neurons and

hepatocytes and cardiomyocytes of the Szt2GT/GT mice (Fig. 2f and Extended Data Fig. 6c).
Thus, loss of the SZT2 component of KICSTOR increases mTORC1 signaling in multiple
mouse tissues in vivo.

Author Manuscript

To define where KICSTOR acts in the mTORC1 pathway, we performed epistasis
experiments between KICSTOR and established components of the pathway. Expression of
the dominant negative Rag GTPases (RagBT54N-RagCQ120L) still inhibited mTORC1 in
SZT2-deficient cells, indicating that KICSTOR is upstream of the Rag GTPases (Fig. 3a).
While great overexpression of GATOR1 suppressed mTORC1 signaling in both wild-type
and SZT2-deficient cells (Fig. 3a), much lower levels of GATOR1 overexpression reduced
mTORC1 signaling to a lesser extent in the SZT2-deficient than wild-type cells, suggesting
that GATOR1 requires SZT2 to efficiently exert its inhibitory effects (Fig. 3b). Loss of
GATOR2 strongly inhibited mTORC1 signaling in wild-type cells, but did not affect the
constitutive signaling of cells deficient for SZT2 (Fig. 3c) or Nprl3 (Extended Data Fig. 7a).
Thus, KICSTOR, likely acting in concert with GATOR1, functions downstream of or in
parallel to GATOR2 to negatively regulate Rag GTPase signaling to mTORC1. Consistent
with this interpretation, loss of KICSTOR, like that of GATOR117, was sufficient to drive
mTORC1 to the lysosomal surface in cells starved of amino acids (Fig. 3d and Extended
Data Fig. 7b).

While Ragulator tethers the Rags to the lysosomal surface13, it is unknown what recruits
GATOR1 there and so we considered such a role for KICSTOR. This was the case as in cells
deficient for KICSTOR, GATOR1 no longer localized to lysosomes and instead was
dispersed throughout the cytoplasm (Fig. 4a, b, and Extended Data Fig. 8a). In contrast, loss
of KICSTOR had little effect on the lysosomal localization of GATOR2 or the Rag GTPases
(Extended Data Fig. 8b, c). In agreement with the imaging results, loss of SZT2 very
strongly decreased the amount of GATOR1, but not GATOR2, on purified lysosomes (Fig.
4c). Consistent with the amino acid-insensitive lysosomal localization of mTOR in cells
deficient for SZT2 (Fig. 3d), amino acid starvation did not reduce the amount of mTORC1
on lysosomes isolated from these cells (Fig. 4c). Given the importance of KICSTOR for
localizing GATOR1 to lysosomes, we reasoned that KICSTOR should be necessary for
GATOR1 to interact with its substrates the Rag GTPases, as well as with GATOR2. Indeed,
loss of SZT2 strongly reduced the amounts of RagA and RagC and GATOR2 that coimmunoprecipitated with GATOR1 (Fig. 4d and Extended Data Fig. 9a, b, c, d). As
previously reported17, amino acid stimulation reduced the interaction of GATOR1 with the
Rag GTPases in wild-type cells (Fig. 4d). Thus, KICSTOR has at least two molecular
functions that can explain its loss of function phenotype: KICSTOR targets GATOR1 to the
lysosomal surface where its substrates, the Rag GTPases, and its potential regulator,
GATOR2, reside (Fig. 4e). KICSTOR is a large complex so it likely has additional roles in
mTORC1 signaling beyond those we have defined, but the protein sequences of its
components do not suggest any biochemical functions. It was not possible to ascertain if
tethering of GATOR1 to the lysosomal surface bypasses the need for KICSTOR for the
control of mTORC1 signaling by nutrients because the addition to any GATOR1 component,
on its N- or C-terminus, of the lysosomal targeting sequence of LAMTOR1 prevented
formation of GATOR1 or its interaction with GATOR2.

It will be important to understand if our findings have therapeutic implications because
mutations in KPTN and SZT2 and loss of the genomic locus containing C12orf66 have been
identified in patients with epilepsy and brain malformation disorders5–9. The fact that the
same diseases are associated with loss of function mutations in GATOR112 and activating
mutations in mTOR21, support the notion that KICSTOR is a negative regulator of the
mTORC1 pathway. Consistent with the phenotypes of patients with mutations in KICSTOR
components, the few mice deficient in Szt2 that survive to adulthood are more susceptible to
epileptic seizures20. If, as in mice, KICSTOR mutations in humans also activate neuronal
mTORC1, patients with these mutations might benefit from inhibition of mTORC1 with
drugs like rapamycin.

cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm at 4°C in a microcentrifuge for 10
minutes. For anti-FLAG-immunoprecipitations, the FLAG-M2 affinity gel was washed with

For transfection experiments in HEK-293T cells, 2 million cells were plated in 10 cm
culture dishes. Twenty-four hours later, cells were transfected via the polyethylenimine
method23 with the pRK5-based cDNA expression plasmids indicated in the figures. The total
amount of plasmid DNA in each transfection was normalized to 5 μg with empty pRK5.
Thirty-six hours after transfection, cells were lysed as described above.

minutes and then stimulated with amino acids for 10 minutes. The amino acid mixture used
was previously described17. For glucose starvation, cells were incubated in RPMI media
lacking glucose but containing amino acids and dialyzed serum for 50 minutes, followed by

Identification of KICSTOR by immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry
Immunoprecipitates from HEK-293T cells expressing endogenously tagged 3xFLAGDEPDC5 were prepared using Triton lysis buffer. Proteins were eluted with the FLAG
peptide (sequence DYKDDDDK) from the FLAG-M2 affinity gel, resolved on 4–12%
NuPage gels (Invitrogen), and stained with simply blue stain (Invitrogen). Each gel lane was
sliced into 10–12 pieces and the proteins in each gel slice digested overnight with trypsin.
The resulting digests were analyzed by mass spectrometry as described4. Peptides
corresponding to KICSTOR components were detected in the FLAG-DEPDC5
immunoprecipitates, while no peptides were detected in negative control immunoprecipitates
of FLAG-metap2.

On day one, 200,000 HEK-293T cells were seeded into 6 wells of a 6-well plate. Twentyfour hours post seeding, each well was transfected with 250 ng shGFP pLKO, 1 ug of the
pX330 guide construct, 0.5 ug of empty pRK5 using XtremeGene9. The following day, cells
were trypsinized, pooled in a 10 cm dish, and selected with puromycin to eliminate
untransfected cells. Forty-eight hours after selection, the media was aspirated and
replenished with fresh media lacking puromycin. The following day, cells were single cell
sorted with a flow cytometer into the wells of a 96-well plate containing 150 ul of DMEM
supplemented with 30% IFS.
For HeLa cells, on day one 1 million cells were plated into a 10 cm dish. Twenty-four hours
later, the cells were transfected with 1 ug pLJM1 GFP and 300 ng of the pX330 guide
construct using XtremeGene9. Selection with puromycin was started the following day to
eliminate untransfected cells. Forty-eight hours after selection, the media was aspirated and

replenished with fresh media lacking puromycin and the cells were single cell sorted as
described above. Cells were grown for two weeks and the resultant colonies were
trypsinized and expanded. Cell clones were validated for reduced expression of the relevant
proteins via immunoblotting (SZT2, KPTN, ITFG2, Nprl3, WDR24) or by confirming that
the targeted exon contains out of frame mutations via genomic DNA sequencing (C12orf66).
Most of the cell clones we generated likely do not express the targeted proteins, but because
there is the possibility that some expression remains below the limit of detection of the
available antibodies, we do not label the clones as null. We suspect that the cell clone
generated with the sgRNA targeting the WDR24 gene expresses a very low amount of the
WDR24 protein that is below the limit of detection of the available antibody.
To generate HEK-293T or HeLa cells stably expressing the indicated sgRNAs, the following
oligonucleotides were cloned into the pLenti viral vectors:

To insert an N-terminal 3xFLAG tag into the WDR59 or DEPDC5 genes, 200,000
HEK-293T cells were seeded into 6 wells of a 6 well plate. Twenty-four hours later, each
well was transfected with the following constructs: 250 ng shGFP pLKO (to provide
transient puromycin resistance), 1000 ng of the indicated single guide RNA (sgRNA), 500
ng of the indicated single stranded DNA oligos, and 5.25 ul XtremeGene9 transfection
reagent.
Single stranded DNA oligos used for homologous recombination:

Forty-eight hours after transfection, the media was removed from cells and replaced with
fresh media supplemented with 2 ug/ml of puromycin. The following day, cells were
trypsinized, pooled, and replated into 10 cm plates in media containing puromycin. Twentyfour hours later, the cell media was changed to fresh media lacking puromycin. Forty-eight
hours later, cells were single cell sorted into 96 well plates in 150 ul of cell media.

Following two weeks of growth, individual clones were expanded. To identify clones
containing a 3xFLAG tag incorporated into the endogenous gene, genomic DNA was
extracted from each clone using QuickExtract DNA solution (Epicentre) as described26. The
primers indicated below were used to amplify the genomic region surrounding the insertion
site, PCR products were subcloned into pRK5, and plasmids were subsequently submitted
for sequencing. Validated clones were tested for their response to amino acid starvation and
stimulation compared to wild type HEK-293T cells to verify that incorporation of the
epitope tag did not alter mTORC1 signaling.

Generation of cells stably expressing cDNAs

Author Manuscript

For the GFP-tagged cDNAs, the indicated GATOR1, GATOR2, and KICSTOR components
were cloned into the N-terminal GFP retroviral vector pIC242 or the C-terminal GFP
retroviral vector KG371 in the case of Mios. For retrovirus production, 750,000 HEK-293T
cells were seeded on Day 1 into a 6 well plate and were transfected 18–24 hours later with 1
ug of pIC242 or KG371 construct, gag/pol and the CMV VSV-G packaging plasmids using
the XtremeGene9 transfection reagent. Twelve hours later the media was changed to fresh
DMEM with 20% IFS, followed by collection of the virus 36 hours after transfection. The
virus was filtered through a 0.45 um filter and added, with polybrene, to the appropriate
HeLa cells in a 6 well plate (500,000 cells per well). Twelve hours later the media was
changed to fresh media. Finally, twenty-four hours after infection the cells were trypsinized
and plated into a 10 cm plate in the presence of 1 ug/ul blasticidin for three days. The
following day, low expressing GFP cells were single cell sorted with a flow cytometer into
the wells of a 96-well plate containing 150 ul of DMEM supplemented with 30% IFS. Cells
were grown for two weeks and the resultant colonies were trypsinized and expanded. Clones
were validated for expression of the relevant protein via immunoblotting. To generate HeLa
cells deficient in KICSTOR and expressing GFP-tagged GATOR1 or GATOR2 components,
the protocol for CRISPR/Cas9 modification of HeLa cells described previously was used,
and the cells were subjected to a second round of cell sorting.

The lentiviral expression plasmids used were: pLJM1-FLAG-metap2, pLJM1-FLAGWDR24, pLJM1-FLAG-Nprl2, and pLJC5-HA-Nprl3 for the interaction experiments and
pLJM1-HA-RFP-LAMP1 for the lysosomal immunopurifications. Lentiviruses were
produced by transfection of HEK-293T cells with the above plasmids in combination with
VSV-G envelope and CMV ΔVPR 8 packaging plasmids. Twenty-four hours after
transfection, the media was changed to DMEM with 20% IFS. Forty-eight hours after
transfection, the virus-containing supernatant was collected from the cells and passed
through a 0.45 μm filter. Target cells were plated in 6-well plates containing DMEM 10%

later, the media was changed to fresh media containing puromycin for selection.
Immunofluorescence assays

Author Manuscript

Immunofluorescence assays were performed as described previously13. Briefly, 300,000
HEK-293T or 150,000 HeLa cells were plated on fibronectin-coated glass coverslips in 6well tissue culture plates. Twenty-four hours later, the slides were rinsed with PBS once and
fixed for 15 minutes with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS at room temperature. The slides
were rinsed three times with PBS and cells were permeabilized with 0.05% Triton X-100 in
PBS for 5 minutes. After rinsing three times with PBS, the slides were blocked for 1 hour in
Odyssey blocking buffer, and then incubated with primary antibody in Odyssey blocking
buffer for 1 hour at room temperature, rinsed three times with PBS, and incubated with
secondary antibodies produced in donkey (diluted 1:1000 in Odyssey blocking buffer) for 45
minutes at room temperature in the dark and washed three times with PBS. The primary
antibodies used were directed against GFP (Rockland Immunochemicals; 1:500 dilution),
LAMP2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; 1:300 dilution), mTOR (CST; 1:100-1:300 dilution),
and RagC (CST; 1:100 dilution). Slides were mounted on glass coverslips using Vectashield
(Vector Laboratories) containing DAPI.
Images were acquired on a Zeiss AxioVert200M microscope with a 63× oil immersion
objective and a Yokogawa CSU-22 spinning disk confocal head with a Borealis modification
(Spectral Applied Research/Andor) and a Hamamatsu Orca-ER CCD camera. The
MetaMorph software package (Molecular Devices) was used to control the hardware and
image acquisition. Images were captured in the Cy3, Cy5, and DAPI channels. Although the
DAPI channel is not shown in the main images, it is in the insets as a blue signal.

For quantitative analyses, the raw image files were opened in the Fiji software package27
and a maximum intensity projection of a z-stack of ~6–8 contiguous focal planes (∼0.5 μm
each) was used. In each cell analyzed, a cytoplasmic region of interest containing lysosomes
(high LAMP2 signal) was chosen and in this area the mean fluorescence intensities (MFIs)
of the Cy5 (LAMP2) and Cy3 channels (GFP, mTOR, or RagC) were measured. In the same
cell an equivalently sized area in a region of the cytoplasm not containing lysosomes (low
LAMP2 signal) was chosen and the MFIs of the Cy5 and Cy3 channels were also measured
in this area. For each channel, the MFI of the non-lysosomal area was subtracted from that
of the lysosomal area. The value obtained for the Cy3 channel was then divided by the
analogous value for the Cy5 channel to give the lysosomal enrichment factor shown in the
bar graphs in the figures. A lysosomal enrichment factor close to 1 indicates that the Cy3
signal was enriched in a region of the cell containing lysosomes over one that does not. A
lysosomal enrichment factor closer to 0 indicates that the Cy3 signal was not enriched at the
lysosomes, indicating no specific co-localization with the Cy5 signal. For each condition
studied, images of at least 3 distinct fields were captured and within each 2–5 cells were
analyzed as described above so that at least 10 cells were analyzed per condition. The mean
lysosomal enrichment factor was calculated for each field analyzed, and the mean of the
means of these fields is shown (bar graphs show mean ± standard error of the mean). In our
experiments, the MFIs in the Cy3 and Cy5 channels were of similar magnitudes and so we

obtained equivalent results regarding lysosomal co-localization whether we subtracted or
divided the MFIs of the two areas in calculating the lysosomal enrichment factors. Twotailed t tests were used for comparisons between conditions. All comparisons were twosided, and p-values < 0.05 were considered significant. Variance was similar across groups.
Analysis of mTORC1 signaling in Szt2GT/GT mice

Author Manuscript

Previously described homozygous 129S1.129P2-Szt2Gt(XH662)Byg/Szt2Gt(XH662)Byg
(hereafter Szt2GT/GT) and wild-type mice20 of 1–5 months in age were fasted for 8 hours
beginning at 7 am. A total of 8 mice were used across experiments – four wild-type females,
three Szt2GT/GT females and one Szt2GT/GT male. Sample size was determined based on
variation in mTORC1 signaling observed in wild-type mice. Mice were sacrificed and the
liver, gastrocnemius muscle, heart, and brain were harvested. Portions of the liver and
muscle were analyzed by immunoblotting for phospho-S235/236 S6, S6, phospho-S65 4EBP1, and 4E-BP1 levels as described18 except that tissues were disrupted with a
homogenizer instead of a sonicator. Small portions of the liver, heart, and brain were fixed in
formalin and processed for phospho-S235/236 S6 immunohistochemistry as described28. All
mice were housed in a barrier facility with standard 12-h light/dark cycle. Food and water
were available ad libitum until the 8-hour fast. Animal studies were performed under
AAALAC and NIH guidelines and were approved by institutional animal care and use
committee (IACUC). No randomization or blinding was performed.
Size exclusion chromatography

Author Manuscript

A confluent 15 cm plate of wild-type or SZT2-defiicient HEK-293T cells (~40 × 106 cells)
was lysed in a CHAPS-containing buffer (50 mM NaHEPES, 100 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl2,
2 mM DTT, and 0.3% CHAPS). The lysate was cleared by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 ×g
for 30 minutes, to completely remove non-lysed cells and insoluble aggregates. The cleared
lysate was normalized to a protein concentration of 3 mg/ml, and 1 ml of it was loaded onto
a tandem Superose 6 gel filtration column. The elutant was fractionated and the proteins in
each fraction were precipitated separately with trichlorocacetic acid (TCA). The precipitants
were collected by centrifugation and washed twice with acetone to remove residual TCA.
The protein pellets were re-dissolved in 2xSDS loading buffer. Equal amounts of each were
separated by 8% SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting for indicated antibodies.

b) An endogenously tagged GATOR2 component co-immunoprecipitates endogenous
GATOR1 and KICSTOR. Anti-FLAG immunoprecipitates were prepared from HEK-293T
cells expressing endogenously FLAG-tagged WDR59, a GATOR2 component, and treated
as in (a). Immunoprecipitates and cell lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting for the
indicated proteins.
c) An anti-KPTN antibody co-immunoprecipitates endogenous components of KICSTOR,
GATOR1, and GATOR2. Anti-KPTN immunoprecipitates were prepared from wild-type
HEK-293T treated as in (a) and immunoprecipitates and cell lysates analyzed by
immunoblotting for the indicated proteins. Anti-GSK3β immunoprecipitates were used to
monitor the non-specific binding of proteins to the beads.
d) KPTN and ITFG2 form a heterodimer that requires SZT2 to associate with C12orf66.
Anti-FLAG immunoprecipitates and lysates prepared from HEK-293T cells expressing the
indicated cDNAs were analyzed by immunoblotting for the relevant epitope tags.
e) Loss of KICSTOR components did not have a significant effect on the expression levels
of GATOR1 or GATOR2 components. HEK-293T cell clones deficient for indicated
KICSTOR components or Nprl3 or WDR24 were generated via the CRISPR/Cas9 system
and single cell cloning. Cell lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting for the indicated
proteins. DNA sequencing of the C12orf66 gene was used to verify out of frame mutations
in the genomic locus of the sgC12orf66 cells because an antibody that detects the C12orf66
protein in cell lysates is not available. The HEK-293T cell clones analyzed here were used in
subsequent figures, where indicated.
f) KPTN interacts with ITFG2 even in cells lacking other KICSTOR components.
Immunoprecipitates and cell lysates prepared from wild-type, SZT2-deficient, or C12orf66deficient HEK-293T cell clones expressing the indicated proteins were analyzed by
immunoblotting.
g) Expression levels of KPTN and ITFG2 in HEK-293T cells stably expressing the indicated
sgRNAs under amino acid starved or replete conditions. Cell lysates were analyzed by
immunoblotting for the levels of the indicated proteins. Raptor serves as a loading control.
These same cell lines were also analyzed for phospho-S6K1 and S6K1 levels in Extended

weight standards are indicated. Note that the C12orf66 antibody exhibits significant
background when used to probe total cell lysates by immunoblotting so we are only
confident that the bands in the high molecular weight fractions that disappear in the SZT2deficient cells actually represent C12orf66.

Figure 1. The KICSTOR complex interacts with GATOR1 and localizes to lysosomes

Author Manuscript

a) Mass spectrometric analyses identified KICSTOR-derived peptides in immunoprecipitates
prepared from HEK-293T cells expressing endogenously FLAG-tagged DEPDC5.
b) Presence or absence of KICSTOR component gene orthologs in model organisms.
c) GATOR1 co-immunoprecipitates more KICSTOR than does GATOR2.
Immunoprecipitates were prepared from HEK-293E cells stably expressing the indicated
FLAG-tagged proteins and analyzed by immunoblotting for the indicated proteins.
d) GATOR2 requires GATOR1 to associate with KICSTOR. Anti-FLAG
immunoprecipitates were prepared from wild-type and Nprl3-deficient HEK-293T cells

transiently expressing the indicated cDNAs. Anti-FLAG immunoprecipitates and lysates
were analyzed as in (c).
e) GATOR1 does not require intact GATOR2 to interact with KICSTOR. Wild-type and
WDR24-deficient HEK-293T cells transiently expressing the indicated cDNAs were treated
and analyzed as in (c).
f) Model proposing that the KICSTOR complex interacts with GATOR1, which in turn
interacts with GATOR2. KPTN, ITFG2, and C12orf66 are indicated by the first letter of
each.
g) KICSTOR localizes to lysosomes in an amino acid independent fashion. Wild-type HeLa
cells stably expressing GFP-ITFG2 were starved or starved and restimulated with amino
acids for the indicated times prior to processing for immunofluorescence detection of GFP
and LAMP2, a lysosomal marker. In all images, insets depict selected fields magnified 3.24×
and their overlays. Scale bar represents 10 μm.
h) GATOR1 localizes to lysosomes regardless of amino acid levels. Nprl2-deficient HeLa
cells were reconstituted with GFP-Nprl2 and treated and analyzed as in (g).
i) GATOR2 localizes to lysosomes regardless of amino acid levels. Wild-type HeLa cells
stably expressing Mios-GFP were treated and analyzed as in (g).

Figure 2. Regulation of mTORC1 signaling by nutrients requires KICSTOR

a) mTORC1 signaling is insensitive to amino acid starvation in cells lacking any KICSTOR
component. HEK-293T cell clones deficient for each KICSTOR component were starved of
amino acids for 50 min or starved and restimulated with amino acids for 10 min. Cell lysates
were analyzed by immunoblotting for the levels and phosphorylation states of the indicated
proteins. See Extended Data Fig. 1e for validation of the KICSTOR deficient cells.

b) Activation of autophagy induced by amino acid starvation requires KICSTOR. The
HEK-293T cell clones as in (a) were monitored for LC3B processing and accumulation after
one hour of amino acid starvation in the absence or presence of chloroquine.
c) mTORC1 signaling is insensitive to glucose starvation in cells lacking KICSTOR.
Experiment was performed as in (a) except that cells were starved of and stimulated with
glucose.
d) SZT2 inhibits mTORC1 signaling in mouse liver. Mice with the indicated genotypes were
fasted for 8 hours and liver lysates analyzed by immunoblotting for the levels and
phosphorylation states of the indicated proteins. Two wild-type and two Szt2GT/GT mice
were analyzed in this experiment and in (e).
e) SZT2 inhibits mTORC1 signaling in the mouse gastrocnemius muscle. Mice were treated
and muscle lysates analyzed as in (d).
f) SZT2 inhibits mTORC1 signaling in mouse neurons in vivo. Brain sections prepared from
mice treated as in (d) were analyzed by immunohistochemistry for phospho-S235/236 S6
levels and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). Equivalent regions of the cortex and
cerebellum are shown for the two genotypes. Scale bar represents 40 μm.

Figure 3. KICSTOR acts upstream of the Rag GTPases

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

a) KICSTOR functions upstream of the Rag GTPases. Wild-type or SZT2-deficient
HEK-293Ts expressing the indicated cDNAs were starved of amino acids for 50 min or
starved and restimulated with amino acids for 10 min. FLAG immunoprecipitates and cell
lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting for the levels and phosphorylation states of the
indicated proteins.
b) Modest GATOR1 overexpression inhibits mTORC1 signaling to a lesser extent in SZT2deficient than in wild-type cells. FLAG immunoprecipitates and cell lysates prepared from
cells expressing the indicated cDNAs and in amino acid replete conditions were analyzed as
in (a). In this experiment 0.5 and 2.0 ng of the cDNA for each GATOR1 component was
transfected while 100 ng of each was used in (a).
c) KICSTOR functions downstream of or in parallel to GATOR2. Wild-type, SZT2deficient, or double SZT2- and WDR24-deficient HEK-293Ts were treated and analyzed as
in (a).
d) Amino acid insensitive localization of mTOR to lysosomes in cells lacking KICSTOR
components. Wild-type and KPTN-, ITFG2-, or SZT2-deficient HEK-293T cells were
starved or starved and restimulated with amino acids for the indicated times prior to
processing for immunofluorescence detection of mTOR and LAMP2. In all images, insets
depict selected fields magnified 3.24× and their overlays. Scale bars represent 10 μm.

Figure 4. The lysosomal localization of GATOR1 requires KICSTOR

a) SZT2 loss renders GATOR1 dispersed throughout the cytoplasm. Nprl2-deficient HeLa
cells were reconstituted with GFP-Nprl2 and subsequently modified with the CRISPR/Cas9
system to create SZT2-deficient cells expressing GFP-Nprl2. These cells were starved or
starved and restimulated with amino acids for the noted times prior to the detection of GFP
and LAMP2 by immunofluorescence. Insets depict selected fields magnified 3.24× and their
overlays. Scale bars represent 10 μm.

b) Loss of C12orf66 or KPTN also disrupts the localization of GATOR1 to the lysosome.
Cell lines were generated, treated, and analyzed as in (a).
c) In SZT2-deficient cells, GATOR1 is not present on immunopurified lysosomes.
Lysosomes were immunopurified from wild-type or SZT2-deficient HEK-293T cells
expressing HA-tagged LAMP1 and starved of and stimulated with amino acids as in (a).
Lysosomes and whole cell lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting for the levels of the
indicated proteins.
d) Loss of SZT2 disrupts the GATOR1-Rag GTPase interaction. Control or SZT2-deficient
HEK-293T cells with or without the stable expression of HA-Nprl3 were starved of amino
acids for 50 min or starved and restimulated with amino acids for 10 min. Lysates and antiHA immunoprecipitates were prepared and analyzed by immunoblotting for the levels of the
indicated proteins.
e) Proposed role for KICSTOR in the nutrient sensing pathway upstream of mTORC1.
