Abstract
Endocrine therapies are the primary systemic intervention for patients with estrogen receptor–positive
(ERþ) breast cancer. However, a signiﬁcant proportion of initially responsive ERþ tumors develop resistance,
with relapses occurring in up to 50% of patients. Lack of reliable predictive biomarkers remains an unﬁlled
need for enhanced clinical management of this disease. In this study, we address this need in identifying a
novel estrogen-regulated gene called SHON (secreted hominoid-speciﬁc oncogene). Enforced expression of
SHON in breast cancer cells increased their proliferation, survival, migration, and invasion in vitro.
Furthermore, SHON enhanced the oncogenicity of these cells in xenograft models of human breast cancer
and was also sufﬁcient to oncogenically transform MCF10A human mammary epithelial cells. Conversely,
SHON attenuation mediated by RNA interference- or antibody-based methods reduced the oncogenicity of
breast cancer cells. Mechanistic investigations indicated that the oncogenic transforming properties of SHON
were mediated by BCL-2 and NF-kB. In primary clinical specimens, SHON was immunohistochemically
detected in 62% of breast cancers, in which its expression was positively correlated with ER expression. In this
setting, SHON expression predicted a favorable response to endocrine therapy in high-risk patients with ERþ
breast cancer. Taken together, our ﬁndings identify SHON as a novel human oncogene with predictive utility
in ERþ breast cancer, perhaps offering a simple biomarker to predict the therapeutic efﬁcacy of antiestrogen
therapy in patients with breast cancer. Cancer Res; 73(23); 6951–62. 2013 AACR.

Introduction
Breast cancer is the most prevalent cancer in females
worldwide. Estrogen signaling and estrogen receptors (ER)
play a pivotal role in the initiation and progression of breast

cancer, with the majority of human breast cancer being initially
estrogen dependent. In accepted models of ER function, estrogen binding to either ERa or ERb results in dimerization and
conformational change (1). The resulting estrogen–ER complex modulates gene transcription by binding to estrogen
response elements in DNA, or by interaction with other transcription factors such as speciﬁcity protein 1 (SP1), activating
protein 1 (AP-1), or NF-kB (2). ER signaling can also be
modulated by other coregulatory proteins or through genomic
and extranuclear actions (3, 4). Expression arrays have identiﬁed early and late estrogen responsive genes (5), including
genes involved in cancer cell proliferation and survival,
enhancing our understanding of the molecular events involved
in estrogen action.
Antiestrogens remain the most effective form of systemic
intervention for patients with ER-positive (ERþ) tumors,
which account for approximately 75% of breast cancers.
Current approaches include the use of selective ER modulators (SERM; e.g., tamoxifen) that compete with estrogen
for ER binding or aromatase inhibitors (e.g., letrozole, anastrozole, and exemestane), which inhibit the synthesis of
estrogen. ERa, the currently used predictive biomarker for
antiestrogen responsiveness, is not consistently accurate in
predicting response due to de novo or acquired tumor
resistance. Although a signiﬁcant high proportion of ERþ
breast tumors initially respond to antiestrogens, resistance

eventually develops, and up to 40% to 50% of patients with
ERþ tumors relapse (6–9), through molecular mechanisms
that are yet to be fully understood. These tumors typically
continue to express ERa (10) and demonstrate earlier metastatic recurrence (11). The expression of ERa–regulated
progesterone receptor (PR) and BCL-2 genes is associated
with improved survival of patients with breast cancer
(12, 13) and serves as a favorable prognostic marker for
endocrine therapy (12, 14). However, there is still no deﬁnitive methodology to distinguish ERþ tumors that will or will
not respond to endocrine therapy.
There appears to be as few as 168 human-speciﬁc genes
among the approximately 23,000 or so genes identiﬁed from
the completion of the human genome project (15). When
expanded to include primate lineages, there may be only
several hundred unique hominoid genes. The identiﬁcation
of such human/hominoid-speciﬁc genes and analysis of their
molecular functions might increase the understanding of the
contributions these genes likely make to human disease processes. Studies have demonstrated that some human/hominoid-speciﬁc genes and their regulated signaling pathways
may serve as biomarkers in human disease (16) and a number
of human/hominoid-speciﬁc genes, such as Tre2 (17) and
TBC1D3 (18–20), have been linked to human cancer. However,
only a few proteins translated from human/hominoid-speciﬁc
genes have been studied and the functions of many others
remain as yet uncharacterized.
Here, we report the identiﬁcation of a novel estrogen
regulated oncogene, secreted hominoid-speciﬁc oncogene
(SHON) in mammary carcinoma and determine the predictive
signiﬁcance of SHON expression for response to endocrine
therapy in high-risk patients with ERþ breast cancer.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines
All cell lines used in this study were obtained from the
American Type Culture Collection and were cultured in conditions as recommended except the MCF-7 cell line that was
cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS, 100 U/mL penicillin, 100 mg/mL streptomycin, and 2
mmol/L L-glutamine in a 37 C humidiﬁed incubator with 5%
CO2.
Plasmid constructs
PIKR2786 (Genentech UNQ ID: UNQ2786) represented by an
expressed sequence tag (EST; GenBank AY358103) was originally identiﬁed, through bioinformatic analysis, as a potential
secreted or transmembrane protein (21). We have demonstrated that UNQ2786 is a secreted protein and is a human
mammary epithelial oncogene and have named it as SHON.
The human SHON-expressing plasmids were constructed by
using a protocol previously described (22). The Bcl-2 P1 promoter reporter plasmid (23) and the NF-kB reporter plasmid
(24) were previously described.

Clinical samples, patient data analysis, and ethics
statement
This study was approved by the Nottingham Research Ethics
Committee 2. Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining was carried out using a cohort of breast tissue specimens from
Nottingham, United Kingdom (25, 26). Detailed patient demographics and clinicopathologic characteristics and methodology about these samples can be found in the Supplementary
Materials and Methods.
A full description of the materials and methods used for this
work is described in Supplementary Materials and Methods.

Results
Expression of SHON in human normal tissues and
carcinoma cell lines
Sequence homology searches using National Center for
Biotechnology Information (NCBI) basic local alignment
search tool (BLAST) revealed that SHON belongs to a hominoid-speciﬁc gene family with no known orthologs outside
the primate lineage. SHON contains a predicted open reading frame of 282 bp encoding a 93-amino acid residue
protein with a predicted molecular mass of 9.7 kDa (Fig.
1A). There is a possibility that an internal disulﬁde bond is
formed between the two cysteines in the mature protein.
SHON gene expression was detected in all 48 human tissues
in a commercially available panel of cDNAs after 40 cycles of
PCR ampliﬁcation (Fig. 1B). SHON mRNA was also expressed in
all cancer cell lines tested (Fig. 1C, top).
A rabbit polyclonal antibody against the C-terminal of the
predicted mature SHON protein was produced and its speciﬁcity was validated (Supplementary Figs. S1 and S2). A speciﬁc
band of the approximate expected size (12 kDa) was detected
in Western blot analysis in all cancer cell lines tested (Fig. 1C,
bottom). However, no SHON protein expression was detected
in the normal human mammary epithelial cell line, MCF10A
(Supplementary Fig. S2D).
SHON is a secreted protein
SHON is predicted to be a secreted protein with a leading
signal peptide encompassing amino acid residues 1 to 21 by
SignalP 3.0 (Fig. 1A; ref. 27). HIS-tagged SHON protein can be
readily detected in both the whole cell lysate and the conditioned media by Western blotting (Fig. 1D).
Forced expression of SHON increases mammary
carcinoma cell growth
MCF-7 cells were stably transfected with the SHON expression plasmid pIRESneo3-SHON (designated MCF7-SHON) or
with the empty vector pIRESneo3 (MCF7-Vec; Fig. 2A). Forced
expression of SHON also resulted in increased SHON protein in
conditioned media (Fig. 2A).
Forced expression of SHON in MCF-7 cells signiﬁcantly
increased cell number under serum-replete (10% FBS; Fig.
2B) and under serum-reduced (0.2% FBS) conditions (Fig.
2C). Forced expression of SHON in MCF-7 cells not only
decreased apoptotic cell death (Fig. 2D), but also increased
entry into S-phase (Fig. 2E).

Forced expression of SHON enhances cell migration and
invasion
SHON increased MCF-7 cell migration in MCF7-SHON cells
versus the control cell line MCF7-Vec (Fig. 2H). The invasive
capacity of MCF7-SHON cells over 48 hours was enhanced
compared with the control cell line MCF7-Vec (Fig. 2H).
Complete wound healing occurred within 72 hours for the
MCF7-SHON cell line, but not in the MCF7-Vec cell line (Fig.
2I). Forced expression of SHON therefore enhanced the motility and invasive capacity of MCF-7 cells.

MCF7-Vec cells grew in clumps with prominent cell-to-cell
contacts in 2D and 3D cultures, typical of an epithelial phenotype, whereas MCF7-SHON cells were scattered, displayed
little intercellular contacts, and formed long cellular protrusions and ﬁlopodia, indicating an invasive phenotype (Fig. 2J).
SHON-stimulated oncogenicity in mammary carcinoma
cells is mediated by BCL-2 and NF-kB
Quantitative PCR was performed to examine the effect of
forced expression of SHON on the relative expression levels of
key genes involved in cell proliferation, survival, oncogenic
transformation and growth (Supplementary Table S3). Most
notably SHON increased BCL-2 expression by 10.16-fold. SHON
also regulated the expression of signaling molecules from
several key signal transduction pathways such as NFKB1
(encodes NF-kB p105) and NFKB1A (encodes IkBa) from the
NF-kB pathway, AKT1 (encodes AKT/PKB) and PIK3R1

Vector cells formed typical acini consisting of regular spherical
structures with a hollow lumen. In contrast, MCF10A-SHON
cells formed large disorganized multiacinar structures with
ﬁlled lumina (Fig. 4B). Furthermore, SHON dramatically
enhanced anchorage-independent growth as indicated by
colony formation in soft agar (Fig. 4C).

inhibitor (28). YC137 not only reduced the colony formation of
both MCF7-Vec and SHON cells in a dose-dependent fashion,
but also largely attenuated the SHON-stimulated enhancement
of the anchorage-independent growth of MCF7-SHON cells,
indicative of BCL-2 dependence of SHON-stimulated soft
agar colony formation (Fig. 3C). Furthermore, YC137 also
largely abrogated the SHON-stimulated enhancement of
MCF7-SHON cell growth in 3D Matrigel although signiﬁcant
inhibition of MCF7-Vec cell growth was also observed as
expected (Fig. 3E).
SHON expression signiﬁcantly increased NF-kB luciferase
reporter activity (Fig. 3A), indicating the activation of NF-kB
pathways. The NF-kB pathways include classic and alternative pathways using NF-kB precursor proteins, p105 (NFkB1) and p100 (NF-kB2), respectively. SHON increased the
expression of NF-kB1 (both p50 and its precursor p105) as
well as its phosphorylated form (phospho-p105), but did not
affect p100 (NF-kB2) expression (Fig. 3B), indicating SHON
activated the classic NF-kB pathway. Activation of the
classic pathway involves the release of p50–p65 (Rel-A) from
the inhibitory protein IkB, as a result of phosphorylation of
IkB by IkB kinase and degradation of IkB by the proteasome.
SHON increased the expression of p65 and phospho-p65 (Fig.
3B). Activation of NF-kB is achieved primarily through the
proteolytic degradation of IkB triggered by IkB phosphorylation at speciﬁc N-terminal residues. SHON increased
the level of phospho-IkB although total IkB expression
remained unchanged (Fig. 3B). NF-kB resides in the cytoplasm in an inactive form and once activated following IkB
degradation, the NF-kB complex undergoes translocation to
the nucleus. SHON expression resulted in a constitutive p65
translocation into the nuclei in MCF7-SHON cells, whereas a
predominant cytoplasmic p65 localization was observed in
the control cell line, MCF7-Vec (Fig. 3G). Both Akt and p44/
42 (ERK1/2) mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) play
a crucial role in the activation of NF-kB (29, 30). SHON
expression signiﬁcantly increased the expression of total
AKT and phosphorylated AKT (phospho-AKT) as well as
total p44/42 and phosphorylated p44/42 (phospho-p44/42)
MAPK (Fig. 3B).
BMS-345541 is an NF-kB–speciﬁc inhibitor and inhibits
IkB kinase thereby blocking NF-kB activation (31). BMS345541 demonstrated a dose-dependent inhibition of colony
formation in soft agar in both MCF7-Vec and MCF7-SHON
cells (Fig. 3D). At a concentration of 10 mmol/L, BMS-345541
largely abrogated the SHON-induced increase in colony
formation of MCF7-SHON cells in soft agar (Fig. 3D) and
the SHON-induced increase in MCF7-SHON cell growth in
3D Matrigel (Fig. 3F), compared with the control cell line,
MCF7-Vec.

SHON expression is strongly correlated with hormone
receptor status and BCL-2 expression in breast cancer
tissues
We next performed a large-scale IHC analysis of SHON
protein in mammary carcinoma using tissue microarrays
(25, 26). A total of 1,237 tumors were suitable for analysis of
SHON expression. Sixty-two percent (766 of 1,237) of the
tumors were SHON positive (Supplementary Table S5). The
associations of SHON expression in breast cancer with clinicopathologic features are presented in Supplementary Table
S7. Notably, SHON expression was highly positively correlated
with hormone receptor status, i.e., ERþ/PRþ and ARþ (androgen receptor–positive), and BCL-2 expression, whereas SHON
was negatively correlated with both EGFR and HER2 overexpression and the triple-negative phenotype.

We stably expressed SHON in MCF10A cells (Fig. 4A).
Compared with the control cell line MCF10A-Vector, SHONoverexpressing MCF10A-SHON cells displayed a more scattered morphology with reduced cell-to-cell contact (Supplementary Fig. S3). When cultured in 3D Matrigel, MCF10A-

Forced expression of SHON promotes MCF-7 tumor
xenograft growth in vivo
In a tumor xenograft mouse model, both MCF7-SHON and
MCF7-Vec cells formed palpable and measurable tumors, but
MCF7-SHON cells formed faster growing and larger tumors
compared with the MCF7-Vec cells (Fig. 4D). Statistically
signiﬁcant enhancement of tumor volume was achieved after
1.5 weeks, and tumors formed by MCF7-SHON cells were larger
in size by 36.0% compared with tumors formed by MCF7-Vec
cells after 6.5 weeks. Tumors formed by MCF7-Vec cells were
well differentiated and cellular, whereas those formed by
MCF7-SHON cells were poorly differentiated and diffuse (Fig.
4E). The MCF7-SHON tumors exhibited a higher percentage of
bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd)-labeled nuclei (Fig. 4F) and fewer terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase–mediated dUTP nick
end labeling (TUNEL)–positive cells compared with the MCF7Vec tumors (Fig. 4G).
SHON mRNA is expressed in normal and cancerous
breast tissues
SHON mRNA was expressed in both normal and breast
cancer tissues in a commercially available Breast Cancer cDNA
Array (Fig. 5A). However, an increased SHON mRNA expression
was observed in cancer tissues compared with the normal
breast tissues. Moreover, the expression level of SHON mRNA
was positively correlated with higher cancer stages (Fig. 5A,
bottom).

Depletion of SHON signiﬁcantly reduced the number of
colonies formed in soft agar (Fig. 6D) and cell migration/

displayed a signiﬁcant reduction in wound-induced migration
(Fig. 6F). Moreover, the colonies formed by MCF7-siRNA cells
in 3D Matrigel were much smaller than the MCF7-CK cells
(Supplementary Fig. S9).
Concordantly, depletion of endogenous SHON in MCF-7
cells signiﬁcantly decreased BCL-2 gene transcription and

transcriptional activity of NF-kB was decreased as a result

proteins in the NF-kB signaling pathway (Supplementary
Fig. S10B).
We also established another SHON-depleted MCF-7 cell line
using the second most effective siRNA, which also exhibited
similar inhibitory effects on cell growth, anchorage-independent growth, and cell migration/invasion in MCF-7 cells (Supplementary Fig. S11).

Functional inhibition of SHON in MCF-7 cells using a
polyclonal antibody reduces growth in 3D Matrigel and
impairs cell invasion
Consistent with the effect of siRNA, a rabbit polyclonal
antibody to SHON inhibited MCF-7 cell invasion in a dosedependent manner (Fig. 6G). The 3D Matrigel growth of both
MCF7-Vec and MCF7-SHON was signiﬁcantly inhibited by the
polyclonal antibody (Fig. 6H). Hence, SHON functions as a
secreted protein.

and also served as a chemoattractant to enhance cell migration
of both MCF-7 and T47D cells.

in tumors could be a predictive biomarker for the response of
ERþ patient to endocrine therapies.
SHON is expressed in both ER and ERþ breast cancer cell
lines. However, we have demonstrated that SHON is an estrogen-regulated gene. A very signiﬁcant correlation of SHON
expression with ER expression was identiﬁed in breast cancer
tissues and consequently SHON may be an important modulator of ER signaling. ER signal transduction involves a
complex web of signaling interactions with other growth factor
signaling pathways (32, 33). In addition to the classic genomic
action associated with nuclear ER, nongenomic ER action has
also been reported: cell membrane or cytoplasm-associated ER
promotes cellular signaling by direct interaction with a variety
of signaling pathways (34). Hence, ER directly associates with
many key signaling molecules such as c-Src, Shc, and the p85a
regulatory subunit of PI3K and modulates important secondary signaling messengers and downstream kinase pathways,
such as the p21Ras/p44/42 MAPK and AKT, leading to, among
other cellular processes, cell proliferation and survival (35). In
the present study, we have demonstrated that forced expression of SHON increased phospho-AKT and phospho-p44/42
MAPK as well as total AKT and MAPK levels, and that the
oncogenicity of SHON is mediated by BCL-2 and NF-kB
signaling pathways. AKT is the cellular homolog product of
the v-akt oncogene and is activated downstream from PI3K by
multiple oncogenic growth factors and cytokines (36). AKT
itself activates multiple downstream effectors and mediates
multiple pathways promoting angiogenesis, tumor progression, and metastasis. Activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway has been reported in various human cancers and contributes to breast cancer progression. AKT can also activate
NF-kB leading to the transcription of antiapoptotic and proinﬂammatory genes (37). BCL-2 is shown to function as an
activator of the AKT signaling, and BCL-2 can also activate
NF-kB through the activation of IkB kinase (IKK, a downstream target of AKT; ref. 38) or through the degradation of the
NF-kB inhibitor IkBa (39). Conversely, BCL-2 is transcription-

6960

Cancer Res; 73(23) December 1, 2013

ally regulated by NF-kB (40) and BCL-2 activity is enhanced by
AKT phosphorylation of BAD and BAX (41). Therefore, SHON
may modulate ER signaling through the activation of p44/42
MAPK, PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways and NF-kB transcriptional
activation of BCL-2. Indeed, we observed synergistic increases
in cell number when cells with forced expression of SHON were
concomitantly treated with estrogen.
Acquired resistance to antiestrogens remains a major obstacle for the successful management of ERþ breast cancer.
Several molecular mechanisms have been proposed to be
responsible for antiestrogen resistance (7, 10). However, the
precise mechanisms remain uncertain. The majority of ERþ
tumors that become antiestrogen resistant retain ER expression (10). Hence, ER-regulated functions have been proposed to
be more important. For example, several estrogen-regulated
genes such as ESR1, PR, BCL-2, Survivin, SCUBE2, HOXB13,
IL17BR, and CHDH have all been associated with endocrine
resistance (42, 43). In this study, we have observed that SHON
expression is a predictor for responsiveness to antiestrogen
treatment in patients with ERþ tumors. We have demonstrated
that SHON is an early estrogen responsive gene, and that SHON
expression in breast tumors is positively correlated with ER,
PR, and AR status. As both PR and AR are ER-targeted genes
and we have shown that SHON is highly correlated to ERþ/PRþ
subtype of breast cancer, SHON could therefore be an important modulator of estrogen signaling. It is therefore not surprising that SHON expression predicted a favorable outcome
for tamoxifen-treated patients with ERþ breast cancer. BCL-2
is an important promoter of cell survival and is overexpressed
in 50% to 70% of solid malignancies, including breast cancer
(44). Although BCL-2 facilitates the survival of tumor cells, its
expression has been consistently associated with a better
prognosis in breast cancer (12). This has been partly attributed
to its correlation with favorable prognostic features such as
ER/PR positivity (45), low proliferation index, absence of HER2
ampliﬁcation, and mutant p53 expression (46). We have
observed that SHON increased the expression of BCL-2 and
its upstream regulator NF-kB in vitro, and SHON expression is
signiﬁcantly and positively associated with BCL-2 expression
in breast cancer. Therefore, SHON may exert its predictive
value via the enhanced expression of BCL-2/NF-kB. However,
the role of SHON and its mechanisms in endocrine therapy
response needs further investigation. For example, forced
expression of SHON in ERþ MCF-7 cells increased the transcriptional activation of NF-kB and activated the PI3K/AKT/
mTOR pathway. However, increased NF-kB activity has been
reported to be associated with antiestrogen resistance and
inhibition of NF-kB activity restored the sensitivity of resistant
MCF-7 cells to antiestrogens (47). In addition, extensive evidence suggests that the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway is linked to
resistance to tamoxifen. In ERa–positive breast cancers treated with tamoxifen, AKT activation was associated with poor
survival (48) and patient relapse (49). In contrast, activation of
AKT was reported to be associated with favorable outcomes in
non–small cell lung cancer (49). Therefore, whether that
compartmentalization of SHON may be important in determining its prognostic effects via activation of AKT requires
further investigation.

Oncogenic Properties and Prognostic Value of SHON

We have demonstrated that SHON is a secreted protein and
that the secreted protein is functional. The antibody neutralization and coculture experiments indicate that SHON can
exert autocrine and/or paracrine effects. The paracrine effects
may be of some relevance, given that IHC staining revealed
both stromal and epithelial expression of SHON. The stroma
and the factors that stromal cells secrete have been demonstrated to play pivotal roles in the growth and dissemination of
mammary carcinoma. Cytoplasmic and nuclear immunolocalization of SHON also suggests that SHON may exert some
cellular functions intracellularly like some other secreted
factors such as growth hormone, EGF, and ﬁbroblast growth
factors, which are often detected in the nucleus of cancer cells
(50). SHON may therefore possess both intercellular and/or
intracellular functions. Nonetheless, whether SHON functions
through binding to a speciﬁc cell surface receptor or serves as
an extracellular or intracellular cofactor of other signaling
molecules remains to be determined.
In conclusion, our results show that SHON expression is
induced by estrogen in breast cancer cells and that SHON
mediates the oncogenicity of breast cancer cells by modulating
ER signaling through the activation of BCL-2, NF-kB, p44/42
MAPK, and PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways. We further demonstrate that SHON expression is positively correlated with better
survival outcomes for patients with ERþ tumors treated with
antiestrogens. These results suggest that pharmacologic modulation of SHON activity, either by siRNA or antibody inhibition, may be clinically useful to treat breast cancer and/or that
evaluation of SHON expression may predict the therapeutic
effect of antiestrogens in patients with ERþ breast cancer.
