Abstract
Our recent unbiased functional screen of 54 chemotherapeutic
drugs unveiled striking heterogeneity in their effects on
dendritic cells (DC). Most notably, vinblastine (VBL) was
found to induce phenotypic and functional maturation of DCs
in vitro. Here, we sought to determine whether VBL exhibits
‘‘dual’’ therapeutic efficacy in living animals by directly killing
tumor cells and by boosting host immunity via DC maturation.
Local injection of VBL in a low dose into the skin of C57BL/6
mice induced in situ maturation of epidermal Langerhans
cells. When coinjected with a model antigen, ovalbumin (OVA),
VBL enhanced OVA-specific cellular and humoral immune
responses. When injected directly into the OVA cDNA–
transduced E.G7 tumors, VBL augmented clonal expansion of
OVA-reactive CD8 T cells and CTL activities. In B16 melanoma
model, intratumor VBL injection induced apoptosis of melanoma cells, phenotypic maturation of tumor-infiltrating DCs,
and significant CTL activities. Although complete clearance
was never achieved, growth kinetic of B16 melanoma was
markedly reduced in C57BL/6 mice by intratumor VBL
injection. Importantly, the same treatment was far less
efficacious in immunocompromised severe combined immunodeficient mice, indicating the requirement of intact host
immunity. Our results introduce a new concept that VBL may
be used to design ‘‘immunostimulatory’’ chemotherapy regimens. [Cancer Res 2009;69(17):6987–94]

Introduction
Chemotherapy is an important mode of treatment for cancer
patients, despite the fact that repeated administrations of cytotoxic
agents at high doses often impair host immunity. Most of the
currently available chemotherapeutics are immunosuppressive
because they inhibit the division of not only cancer cells, but also
effector leukocytes in the bone marrow and peripheral lymphoid
tissues (1, 2). Dendritic cells (DC) play crucial roles in host immune
responses to cancer cells (3). Although varying numbers of DCs are
found in the cancer tissue, they remain immature due to
immunosuppressive microenvironment associated with cancer

cells and infiltrating leukocytes (4–6). Cytotoxic chemotherapy
causes release of tumor-associated antigens by directly killing
cancer cells. If tumor-infiltrating DCs can efficiently incorporate
and cross-present these antigens to CD8 T cells, it would then
enable the host immunity to combat with the remaining cancer
cells. This may be achievable by delivering maturation signals to
tumor-infiltrating DCs—selected anticancer drugs seem to trigger
DC maturation (7–9), and DC maturation has been induced by
coadministration of agonistic anti-CD40 monoclonal antibody
(mAb) with a chemotherapeutic drug (10).
By testing 54 anticancer drugs for their impacts on DCs, we
recently identified a unique class of drugs, termed ‘‘type 1,’’
capable of inducing phenotypic and functional maturation of
DCs. Briefly, a prototypic type 1 drug vinblastine (VBL) was found
to elevate CD40, CD80, CD86, and MHC class II expression by
mouse bone marrow–derived DCs (BM-DC); induce interleukin
(IL)-1h, IL-6, and IL-12 production; and augment their ability to
activate allogeneic T cells. Moreover, VBL-treated DCs were far
more efficient than vehicle-treated DCs in dextran uptake and
cross-presenting ovalbumin (OVA) protein to CD8 T cells. VBL
induced all these changes at relatively low concentrations (0.1–
1.0 Amol/L; ref. 11).
Although direct cytotoxicity of VBL for tumor cells is generally
attributed to its therapeutic effect, VBL has been reported to block
angiogenesis when administered continuously at low doses,
suggesting an additional mechanism of its action (12). VBL was
shown to inhibit the expansion of ‘‘suppressor’’ T cells (13).
Likewise, cyclophosphamide seems to potentiate immune
responses against established tumors by eliminating regulatory T
cells (14, 15). Paclitaxel promoted IL-12 production by macrophages (16), whereas doxorubicin augmented the cytostatic
potential of macrophages against tumor cells (17). When combined
with vaccination with whole tumor cells engineered to secrete
granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor, cyclophosphamide, paclitaxel, and doxorubicin all augmented the generation of
antitumor immune responses (18). Gemcitabine enhanced T cell–
mediated antitumor immune responses, while suppressing humoral responses (10, 19). Imatinib mesylate elevated antigen-presenting
capacities of DCs in the presence of lipopolysaccharide (20),
promoted DC-dependent natural killer cell activation (21), and
triggered in vivo expansion of a unique DC subset termed IFNproducing killer DCs when coadministered with IL-2 (22). These
reports, although sporadic in nature, suggest that selected chemotherapeutics may boost host immunity against tumors (1).
Based on our in vitro findings that VBL induced maturation of
DCs and augmented their antigen uptake and cross-presentation,
we hypothesized that one might be able to kill small numbers
of cancer cells and, at the same time, trigger maturation of

tumor-infiltrating DCs by injecting VBL into the tumors locally at
low doses. If so, maturing DCs would, in turn, incorporate tumor
antigens released from dying cancer cells, migrate to draining
lymph nodes, and then cross-present relevant antigens to CD8 T
cells. The present study was conducted to test this hypothesis.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines. The OVA-transduced EL4 tumor line, E.G7-OVA (23), kindly
provided by Dr. Eli Gilboa (University of Miami, Miami, FL), and the B16-F1
melanoma line purchased from the American Type Culture Collection were
maintained as before (24).
Reagents. VBL (Sigma) and cisplatin (CDDP; Acros Organics) were
dissolved in DMSO at 2 mmol/L. OVA was dissolved in PBS at 100 mg/mL
and then passed through the polymixcin B column repeatedly until
endotoxin became undetectable by the QCL-1000 system.
In vivo testing of immune-potentiating properties of VBL. All in vivo
experiments were performed by injecting a 100 Amol/L (or 90 Ag/mL) VBL
solution or vehicle alone (0.5% DMSO in PBS). C57BL/6 mice received s.c.

injections of OVA (400 Ag/animal) together with VBL (200 AL VBL solution
or 18 Ag VBL/animal) or vehicle alone at the base of the tail on days 0 and 7.
On day 14, serum samples were examined for OVA-specific humoral
responses by ELISA, and spleen cells and inguinal lymph node cells were
tested for their proliferative responses to OVA by 3H-thymidine uptake
(25, 26). To assess T-cell cytokine profiles, draining lymph nodes harvested
from immunized mice were incubated with OVA257-264 or OVA323-339 peptide
and then analyzed for intracellular IFN-g and IL-4 in CD8+ or CD4+ T-cell
populations, respectively. To examine the impact on Langerhans cells (LC),
VBL (40 AL solution or 3.6 Ag/animal) and vehicle alone was s.c. injected to
the right and left ears of the same C57BL/6 mice, respectively. Two days
later, ear skin samples were harvested to examine MHC II and CD86
expression in epidermal sheet preparations (25). In some experiments, VBL
was injected to the Langerin-EGFP-diphtheria toxin receptor (DTR)–knock-in
mice (27), and phenotypic maturation was then examined within the EGFP+
epidermal populations. To assess mechanisms for accelerated migration, we
measured CCR7 expression by BM-DCs and their chemotactic activities as
before (24, 25).
Measurement of dynamic behaviors of epidermal LCs. VBL or vehicle
alone was administered into the ear of EGFP-I-Ah-knock-in mice (28) and

maturation in mice. A, VBL (3.6 Ag/animal)
or vehicle alone was s.c. injected into

respectively. Ear skin specimens were
harvested 48 h later, and epidermal sheets
were stained for MHC II (green ) and CD86
(red). Scale bar, 50 Am. B, the epidermal
sheet preparations were examined for the
number of MHC II+ LCs, the level of MHC II
expression by LCs, and the frequency of
CD86+ cells in MHC II+ LCs. Columns,

epidermal cell suspensions were examined
48 h later for MHC II, CD40, and CD86
expression within the EGFP+ populations.

of epidermal LC. I-Ah-EGFP knock-in mice received
s.c. injection of VBL (3.6 Ag/animal) or vehicle alone
into the right ear and anesthetized 24 h later to
visualize dynamic behaviors of EGFP+ LCs in the
injection sites. Actual behaviors are shown in

is expressed by dSEARCH index (n = 30; B). Extent of
lateral migration of cell bodies is indicated by total

augmented the dSEARCH motion (P < 0.0003) and the
lateral migration (P = 0) assessed by Mann-Whitney
U test.

three-dimensional images of EGFP+ epidermal cells were recorded every
2 min by a Zeiss LSM510 META2P confocal microscope (29). The
magnitudes of motile activities of dendritic processes and cell bodies were
then assessed by calculating the dSEARCH index and the total traveled
distance, respectively (29).
Assessment of therapeutic efficacy of VBL in tumor models. Tumor
cells (1  106 cells/mouse) were s.c. injected into the back of mice, and VBL
(50 AL solution or 4.5 Ag/animal), CDDP (50 AL 0.8 mmol/L or 240 Ag/mL
solution or 12 Ag/animal), or vehicle alone was directly injected into the
tumor. CTL activities were measured by a standard 4 h 51Cr release assay
(24). Perpendicular tumor diameters were measured thrice a week using a
caliper and the tumor areas calculated by multiplying the two diameter
values. All experiments were conducted according to the NIH guidelines
and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at
University of Texas Southwestern.

iodide and Annexin V staining, calreticulin expression by flow cytometry,
and release of high-mobility-group box 1 by ELISA.
In vivo assays for tumor cell apoptosis and DC activation. Cryostat
sections of the B16 melanoma skin lesions were doubled stained with the
In situ Cell Death Detection kit (Roche) and 4¶,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole
(DAPI; Sigma) or for CD11c and CD86. The extent of apoptosis was
measured by counting the percentage of TUNEL expression in DAPIpositive nuclei (2,800–3,500 nuclei per sample).
Statistical analysis. All in vitro measurements were made in triplicate
samples and each test drug was compared with vehicle alone by a two-tailed
Student’s t test. Synergistic effects were analyzed by ANOVA and multiple
comparison by Ryan’s method. The data from CTL assays were analyzed by
Mann-Whitney’s U test with Bonferroni adjustment. The tumor growth data
were analyzed by log-rank test using time-to-event as the readout.

Results
Local VBL injection triggers LC maturation and mobilization. To test the impact on LCs, tissue-resident immature DCs in
skin (30), VBL, or vehicle alone were s.c. injected VBL into right or
left ears of BALB/c mice. In VBL injection sites, LCs visualized with
anti-MHC II mAb showed a marked increase in size and irregular
hyperelongation of dendrites (Fig. 1A), two characteristic changes
observed with in vivo maturing LCs after topical application of
reactive haptens (31). VBL injection also induced the expression of
CD86 and f50% reduction in LC densities, presumably reflecting
LC migration to lymph nodes (Fig. 1B). We noticed no apparent
inflammatory change in VBL injection sites, and the ear thickness
remained unchanged (193 F 5 Am; mean F SE, n = 5) compared
with vehicle-injected ears (185 F 7 Am). When VBL was injected
into Langerin-EGFP-diphtheria toxin receptor knock-in mice (27),
the EGFP+ epidermal cells (i.e., LCs) exhibited significantly upregulated expression of MHC II, CD40, and CD86 (Fig. 1C).
Our recent imaging study revealed that in situ maturation of LCs
is accompanied by dramatic changes in their motile behaviors (29).
We next injected VBL into the ear of anesthetized I-Ah-EGFP
knock-in mice (28) and recorded motile activities of EGFP+ LCs.
Local VBL injection significantly augmented the rhythmic extension and retraction of dendrites, a motion termed ‘‘dSEARCH’’
(Supplementary Movie S1; Fig. 2A and B). VBL also induced
amoeba-like lateral migration of cell bodies in the epidermal
compartment (Fig. 2A and C). These results further support our
conclusion that LCs undergo in situ maturation in response to local
injection of a small amount of VBL.
Because CCR7 reportedly mediates chemotactic migration of
mature LCs from epidermis to lymph nodes (32), we examined
whether VBL induces CCR7 expression in vitro. Mouse BM-DCs were
treated with VBL (0.3 Amol/Lf) or vehicle alone and then examined
for CCR7 surface expression. VBL elevated CCR7 expression by BMDCs and VBL-treated BM-DCs showed significantly augmented
migration toward CCL19 (Supplementary Fig. S1). These in vitro
observations were consistent with our in vivo finding that locally
injected VBL reduced surface densities of epidermal LCs.
Local injection of VBL augments adaptive immune
responses to a model protein antigen. The observed ability of
VBL to trigger in situ maturation and mobilization of LCs implied
that VBL might function as an adjuvant depending upon the routes
and doses of administration. To test this, we s.c. injected VBL in a
low dose together with a model antigen OVA. Mice immunized
with OVA + VBL showed significantly higher concentrations of
OVA-specific antibodies than did control mice immunized with
OVA alone (Fig. 3A). Spleen cells and lymph node cells harvested
from the mice immunized with OVA + VBL exhibited significantly
augmented proliferative responses to OVA compared with controls
immunized with OVA alone (Fig. 3B). In addition, immunization
with VBL also resulted in a significant, albeit rather modest,
increase in the percentage of IFN-g–producing CD4 T cells
(Fig. 3C). These results showed a previously unrecognized activity
of VBL to augment both humoral and cellular immune responses.
Using the OVA-transduced tumor line, E.G7 (23), we next
injected VBL directly into the tumors producing OVA as a model
tumor antigen. Again, we injected vehicle alone to serve as a
control. Because intratumor injection of VBL, but not vehicle alone,
would kill some cancer cells, the second control panel received

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (17). September 1, 2009

intratumor injection of a platinum agent cisplatin (CDDP), which
failed to induce DC maturation, reduce DC viability, or inhibit DC
growth at the tested concentrations (0.1–10 Amol/L; ref. 11).
Intratumor VBL injection significantly augmented CTL activities
against E.G7 tumor targets compared with either control panel
(statistical significance is summarized in Supplementary Table S1;
Fig. 4A). To visualize the impact on T-cell expansion, CD8 T cells
purified from the OT-I transgenic mice were adoptively transferred
into tumor-bearing mice. Marked expansion of OVA-reactive CD8 T
cells was observed in those mice receiving intratumor injection of
VBL, but not CDDP or vehicle alone (Fig. 4B). We interpret these
results to suggest that OVA-specific CD8 T-cell responses are readily
inducible by injecting VBL directly into OVA-producing tumors.
Impact of intratumor injection of VBL on B16 melanoma.
Because OVA is a highly immunogenic xeno-antigen, our
observations with E.G7 tumor may have limited clinical relevance.
Thus, we used B16 melanoma as our second tumor model. First,
we tested in vitro effects of VBL on B16 melanoma cells—VBL from

7 d after the second immunization were examined for OVA-specific total
immunoglobulins and IgG of the indicated isotypes (columns, means from three
independent animals; bars, SD). B, the spleen cells (top ) and draining lymph
node cells (bottom ) were examined for their proliferative responsiveness in the

alone, OVA alone, or OVA + VBL, draining lymph node cells were harvested
on day 9. After in vitro restimulation with MHC I– or MHC II–restricted OVA peptide,
CD8+ or CD4+ T-cell populations were analyzed for intracellular cytokine profiles,
respectively. Statistically significant differences compared with the control panel
are indicated (*, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01; ***, P < 0.001).

or vehicle alone (day 3) and i.v. injection of
CFSE-labeled OT-I CD8 T cells (3  106 cells/
animal; day 4). Two days later, the extent of OT-I T
cell expansion in draining lymph nodes was
assessed by measuring CFSE fluorescence
intensity of the CD8+/TCR Va2+ populations.
Lymph node cells harvested from C57BL/6 mice
without transfer of CFSE-labeled OT-I T cells were
analyzed in parallel (left, Background ).

0.01 to 1 Amol/L inhibited 3H-thymidine uptake and induced
apoptosis in dose-dependent manners (Supplementary Fig. S2A
and B). Recent studies have shown that tumor cells dying in
response to chemotherapeutic drugs augment DC activation via
releasing HMGB1 (9) and that selected anticancer drugs induce
calreticulin surface expression by tumor cells, thereby facilitating
their uptake by DCs (8). We observed that VBL induced HMGB1
release by B16 melanoma cells (Supplementary Fig. S2C) without
triggering significant calreticulin expression (Supplementary
Fig. S2D and E). VBL treatment of BM-DCs induced significantly
augmented release of IL-12 (p40), consistent with our recent
finding (11). When cocultured with VBL-pretreated, apoptotic B16
melanoma cells, BM-DCs released significant amounts of IL-12.
Importantly, the two stimuli (i.e., coculturing with apoptotic tumor
cells and direct exposure to VBL) augmented IL-12 production in a
synergistic manner (Supplementary Fig. S2F). Thus, we hypothesized that killing of B16 melanoma cells and maturation of tumorinfiltrating DCs might be both achievable by injecting a small
amount of VBL directly into B16 melanoma.
VBL injection induced significant apoptosis of tumor cells
(Fig. 5A). A small fraction (5.7 F 1.0%; n = 3) of the tumor cells
were positive for terminal deoxynucleotidyl-transferase–mediated
dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) after vehicle injection, whereas
significantly (P < 0.01) higher numbers of TUNEL-positive tumor cells
were observed after VBL injection (19.5 F 2.7%; n = 3), validating the
first part of our hypothesis. To test the second part, we assessed
phenotypic maturation of tumor-infiltrating DCs. The numbers of
CD11c+ DCs seemed comparable between the two B16 melanoma
lesions treated with VBL versus vehicle alone. Importantly, CD86expressing CD11c+ DCs were detected only after VBL injection
(Fig. 5B). Moreover, B16 melanoma–bearing mice that had received
intratumor VBL injection showed significant CTL activities to kill
51
Cr-labeled B16 melanoma targets (Fig. 5C). By contrast, control
mice receiving intratumor injection of CDDP or vehicle alone showed
only negligible CTL activities. Thus, in situ maturation of tumorinfiltrating DCs is inducible by local injection of VBL, but not CDDP.
To test the therapeutic efficacy, we injected VBL, CDDP, or
vehicle alone directly into B16 melanoma and measured the

www.aacrjournals.org

subsequent tumor growth. For an ethical reason, all animals were
euthanized when the tumor size exceeded 10 mm in diameter.
Because of rapid and progressive growth of B16 melanoma, we had
to sacrifice all animals in the vehicle-injected panel within 10 days.
The second panel receiving intratumor CDDP injection showed
statistically significant, although marginal, delay in B16 melanoma
growth, most likely reflecting direct cytotoxicity of CDDP against
B16 melanoma. Intratumor injection of VBL showed a more readily
noticeable efficacy (statistical significance is summarized in
Supplementary Table S1; Fig. 6A)—some (6 of 10) of the mice
showed temporal tumor remission, although all mice were
eventually euthanized at later time points (14–43 days after tumor
inoculation).
Two repeated intratumor VBL injections resulted in prolonged
tumor remission (ranging from 10–40 days) in all animals, although
complete regression was never observed (Fig. 6B). Two repeated
CDDP injections showed statistically significant, but marginal,
therapeutic efficacy over the vehicle-injected panel. Importantly,
two repeated injections of VBL into the abdominal skin did not
affect the B16 melanoma growth in the back skin, indicating that
VBL at the tested dose had no or limited systemic effects on tumor
growth.
In both single and two repeated injection protocols, VBL showed
more prominent therapeutic efficacies than did CDDP. The
observed difference might reflect differential impact of the two
anticancer drugs on host immunity or simply differential toxicity
against B16 melanoma cells. To distinguish the two possibilities, we
repeated the same experiments in severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice. Mice receiving two repeated intratumor VBL
injections showed significantly delayed B16 melanoma growth
compared with the vehicle injected control (Fig. 6C). The observed
therapeutic efficacy for VBL in immunodeficient SCID mice,
however, was rather modest compared with that observed in
immune-competent C57BL/6 mice. By contrast, the efficacy of
CDDP was comparable between C57BL/6 mice and SCID mice.
Most importantly, CDDP was almost indistinguishable from VBL in
their beneficial effects in the SCID mice, indicating comparable
cytotoxicity against B16 melanoma between the two drugs. Thus,

we concluded that intact host immunity is required for intratumor
VBL injection to exhibit therapeutic advantages over CDDP.

Discussion
Our results have unveiled previously unrecognized pharmacologic activities of VBL. In situ maturation of LCs was readily
induced by local injection of VBL in a low dose. VBL also
functioned as an adjuvant when coinjected with a model antigen.
Intratumor injection of VBL caused not only tumor cell apoptosis,
but also phenotypic maturation of tumor-infiltrating DCs, significant CTL activities, and interrupted tumor growth. Thus, we
conclude that VBL may be used to achieve dual therapeutic
outcomes, direct killing of cancer cells, and boosted host immunity
via DC maturation.
Interactions between dying cancer cells and surrounding DCs
determine the direction, type, and magnitude of host immune

responses to the remaining cancer cells (33, 34). Like other
phagocytes, DCs can recognize and captureng dying cancer cells
occurring naturally or being induced by chemotherapy. Necrotic
cell death is known to serve as a rich source of endogenous
‘‘danger’’ signals, thereby eliciting DC maturation, whereas
apoptotic cell death is generally considered immunologically silent
or even tolerogenic, DCs in the steady-state induce peripheral
immunologic tolerance by capturing, processing, and presenting
apoptotic cells that emerge during physiologic tissue turnover
(35, 36). We now know that apoptotic cells may induce DC
maturation under certain conditions. For example, double-stranded
RNA found in virally infected apoptotic cells induced DC
maturation by a TLR3-dependent mechanism (37). Casares and
colleagues (38) reported that cancer cells killed by doxorubicin, a
topoisomerase inhibitor, but not by mitomycin C, triggered
phenotypic maturation of DCs. Moreover, they have successfully

eradicated established CT26 tumors in mice by a single intratumor
injection of doxorubicin, but not of mitomycin C. With regard to
mechanisms, Obeid and colleagues (8) reported that doxorubicin
and its analogues (idarubicin and mitoxantrone) produce an
immunogenic form of cancer cell apoptosis by triggering rapid
translocation of calreticulin to the cell surface. Spisek and
colleagues (39) reported that myeloma cells killed by bortezomib,
an inhibitor of 26S proteasome, but not by g-irradiation or
dexamethasone, expressed heat shock protein 90, thereby inducing
DC maturation. Moreover, tumor cells dying in response to
chemotherapeutic drugs have been shown to augment DC
activation via releasing HMGB1 (9). These findings illustrate
additional functional heterogeneity among chemotherapeutic
drugs in terms of the modality (or immunogenicity) of resulting
cancer cell death (2, 7). Interestingly, VBL induced HMGB1 release
from B16 melanoma cells without causing calreticulin expression,
and VBL-pretreated apoptotic melanoma cells synergized with VBL
to augment DC maturation. These unique immunestimulatory
properties identified for selected anticancer drugs must be taken
into consideration when combining multiple chemotherapeutics
for ultimate clinical outcome.
The magnitude of immune responses observed after vaccination
with OVA + VBL was rather modest compared with that inducible
by OVA plus CpG oligonucleotides (data not shown). Although
locally injected VBL significantly delayed the growth of B16
melanoma, all the mice showed relapses after temporal remission,
representing a major limitation of our protocol to serve as a stand-

alone therapy. Combination of VBL with additional immunostimulating agent(s) may produce markedly improved outcomes. In
fact, VBL has been combined with IL-2 and/or IFN-a for the
treatment of advanced cancer patients (40, 41).
Optimal phenotypic and functional maturation of DCs was induced by VBL at 1 Amol/L or 0.9 Ag/mL (11), and this concentration
was sufficient to cause optimal growth inhibition and apoptosis of
B16 melanoma cells. Thus, we chose to administer a 100 Amol/L
(or 90 Ag/mL) VBL solution in relatively small amounts. In
standard clinical regimens, VBL is administered systemically and
repeatedly by bolus i.v. infusions at maximal tolerated doses of
0.1 to 0.3 mg/kg body weight. In various tumor models in mice,
VBL monotherapy produced only partial and temporal regression
after a single systemic injection at the maximal tolerated dose
(5–10 mg/kg) or even after repeated injections (0.5–6 mg/kg/day;
refs. 42–44). In our protocol, a significant delay in tumor growth
was observed after a single or two intratumor injections of VBL at
the dose of 4.5 Ag/mouse (i.e., 0.18 mg/kg). Consistent with our
observations in the SCID mice, weekly intratumor injections of
VBL at 0.3 mg/injection/kg was reported to be ineffective for
human melanomas implanted to the nude mice (45). Thus,
immune-stimulatory outcomes seem to be inducible by VBL only
when administered locally at relatively low doses and only in
immune-competent hosts. Extravasation of Vinca alkaloids causes
severe skin inflammation and necrosis. Although a 1 mg/mL VBL
solution used for bolus i.v. infusion therapy produces such local
necrotic changes, a 0.2 mg/mL VBL solution has been injected

directly to oral lesions of Kaposi’s sarcomas without causing
devastating complications (46). We observed no apparent inflammation after s.c. injection of a 90 Ag/mL VBL solution, in
agreement with the previous report that VBL produces dosedependent local toxicity (47). These observations suggest relative
safety of our protocol in which VBL is injected directly into tumors
in relatively small amounts (causing minimal myelo-suppression)
and at relatively low concentrations (causing minimal local
toxicity).
Suppression of host immunity is a major adverse effect of
chemotherapy, in which multiple agents with myelo-suppressive
potentials are administered repeatedly and systemically at
relatively high doses (1). We now know that selected anticancer
drugs augment host immunity depending upon the routes and
doses of administration and that cancer cells killed by certain
drugs deliver maturation signals to DCs (2). Our results provide
