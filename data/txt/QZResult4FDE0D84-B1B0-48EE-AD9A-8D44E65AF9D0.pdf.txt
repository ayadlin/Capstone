ABSTRACT
Introduction: Colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer in the world, a
small fraction of which is represented by locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC). If not
medically contraindicated, preoperative chemoradiotherapy, represent the standard
of care for LARC patients. Unfortunately, patients shows a wide range of response
rates in which approximately 20% has a complete pathological response, whereas in
20 to 40% the response is poor or absent.
Results: The following specific gene signature, able to discriminate responders’
patients from non-responders, were founded: AKR1C3, CXCL11, CXCL10, IDO1, CXCL9,
MMP12 and HLA-DRA. These genes are mainly involved in immune system pathways
and interact with drugs traditionally used in the adjuvant treatment of rectal cancer.
Discussion: The present study suggests that new ideas for therapy could be found
not only limited to studying genes differentially expressed between the two groups
of patients but deepening the mechanisms, associated to response, in which they are
involved.
Methods: Gene expression studies performed by: Agostini et al., Rimkus et al.
and Kim et al. have been merged through a meta-analysis of the raw data. Gene
expression data-sets have been processed using A-MADMAN. Common differentially

expressed gene (DEG) were identified through SAM analysis. To further characterize
the identified DEG we deeply investigated its biological role using an integrative
computational biology approach.

The “meta-analysis” of data produced by different
but comparable studies could in theory increase the
statistical power and reliability of the study beyond the
original experimental design. On the other hand, different
datasets are often produced using different platforms,
presenting some challenges for meaningful data integration
[21]. In this scenario there are two main possible strategies
to integrate the results of independent gene expression
studies: i) the combination of retrospective analysis
results (i.e. final lists of differentially expressed genes);
ii) de-novo analysis (re-analysis) of raw data [22, 23].
In this study, we performed a de novo meta-analysis
on data from rectal tumor tissue to identify a gene set
associated to pCRT response in association with the disease
free survival data. The Annotation-based Microarray Data
Meta-ANalysis tool (A-MADMAN; http://compgen.bio.
unipd.it/bioinfo/amadman/) [24], an open source web
application that was already successfully used in several
studies [25–27] was used to retrieve, annotate and integrate
gene expression data from three independent datasets.
In addition, we applied an integrated computational
approach to interpolate data derived from genetic
signatures and proteomic analyses to achieve more reliable
predictions in the response to treatment.

INTRODUCTION
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common
cancer in the world. According to recent epidemiological
data, in 2014 nearly 50,310 patients died from CRC with
a substantial equality distributed in both sex [1]. One-third
of CRC are represented by rectal cancer (RC) and 40% of
this are locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC). Although
the genetic screening has been proven to greatly reduce
the mortality for CRC, up to now there is a deficiency
of clinical tools for an effective and early individuations
of neoplasia. Preoperative chemoradiotherapy (pCRT),
presently the standard of care for LARC [2–6], shows
unfortunately a wide range of response rates in which
approximately 20% of patients have a complete
pathological response, whereas in 20 to 40% of patients
the response is poor or absent [7, 8]. In addition, an
ineffective pCRT is time-consuming, expensive and
increases the perioperative morbidity. The development
of novel approaches predictors of tumor response to
pCRT are critical in reducing mortality in LARC and
in sparing poorly responding patients from unnecessary
treatments. Several studies have been performed to
evaluate potential predictors of response after pCRT
in rectal cancer, however the data are still unclear and
controversial [9, 10]. Discrepancies among studies were
mainly related to patient selection, sample size, study
design, treatments and parameters used for tumor response
evaluation. As a consequence, the only accepted marker
to monitor colorectal cancer treatment, progression and
disease relapse is the carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA),
but its sensitivity and specificity, especially for early stage
colorectal cancer, seems to be insufficient [10, 11]. Drug
sensitivity in chemotherapy is thought to be attributable
to the variations in the genetic background of cancer cells
and gene expression signatures have a great potential for
predicting therapeutic outcomes better than conventional
clinical and pathological approaches [12]. In this
landscape, gene signatures, based on rectal cancer cell
expression profiling obtained by microarray technology,
could be useful predictors of tumour response after pCRT.
Some studies focusing on the prediction of response to
treatment based on mRNA gene expression in LARC
patients have been performed, but no overlap was found
in the predictive genes list [12, 13] since the analyzed
patients had received heterogeneous treatments.
For instance, in the paper from Watanabe et al. [14]
patients were treated with radiotherapy alone, whereas
Cetuximab was added to the conventional pCRT by Daemen
et al. [15] and Debucquoy et al. [16]. In other studies
[17–19] and a paper from our laboratory [20] the major
limitation is probably the number of patients tested.

RESULTS
Responders vs non-responders: meta-analysis of
clinical and gene expression data
Initially, we focused on clinical data to understand
whether there was a correlation between responses to
therapy with the overall survival. Then, we integrated gene
expression signatures with both functional information, such
as: biological processes (BP), cellular components (CC) and
molecular functions (MF); and clinical data to search for
differences in gene expression linked to pCRT response and
to obtain information on the molecular mechanisms that
could be involved in differential survival.
The array-based gene expression profiling in LARC
tumor samples in relation to pCRT response of patients
has been evaluated in a cohort of 85 samples, coming from
the three independent studies. Data have been collected
and integrated to conduct a meta-analysis aiming at the
identification of a robust gene signature able to predict
chemo-radio resistance.
In this regard, we compared the gene lists identified
by the three independent studies. No shared markers
resulted after data intersection, including XRCC3 the
promising gene identified in our study, probably due to
the different data analysis procedures (Supplemental
Table 1). To address this issue, we processed together the

statistical sample. Through a de-novo integration of gene
expression data in a single matrix we selected 277 genes

Genes (DEG) expression profiles and the boxplot showing

Gene ontology (GO) analysis has been performed
on the seven selected genes. DAVID web-based tool was
used to investigate biological processes (BP), cellular
components (CC) and molecular functions (MF) shared
by them. Ordered by statistical significance, BP results
showed that five out of seven genes (CXCL10, CXCL11,
CXCL9, IDO1, HLA-DRA) were involved in defense
response and four genes (CXCL10, CXCL11, CXCL9,
IDO1) in inflammatory response pathway. Four genes
(CXCL10, CXCL11, CXCL9, MMP12) encoded for
proteins commonly located in the extra-cellular regions,
according to CC information. Three genes (CXCL10,
CXCL11, CXCL9) showed the same MF sharing
chemokine, cytokine activity and chemokine receptor
binding. The most significant three out of seven SAM
genes (AKR1C3, CXCL10 and IDO1, Figure 1) were

procedure with p = 0.05 assumption.
We also estimated the prediction error via crossvalidation using PAM machine learning method, which
provides a list of significant genes able to discriminate
between responders and non-responders.
No genes were found (PAM, Supplemental Figure 2)
to be predictive in distinguishing responders from nonresponders groups. A comprehensive summary (Table 2)
was created to summarize the analyses results.
To further strengthen our results, we validated the
predictive power of genetic signature by an elaboration
of data from two independent TCGA CRC cohorts,
respectively (n = 237) and (n = 881); in two out seven DEG,
one over-expressed and one under-expressed. This result,
in complete accordance with our data, showed an overexpression of IDO1 and an under-expression of AKR1C3
in responders patients (Supplemental figure 3) according
to Residual tumor classification (see Methods paragraph),
confirming the same trend obtained in our study [28].

Genes correlated with survival
We further evaluated the entire gene expression
profiles for two out of three studies to identify genes
related to survival (Agostini et al.; Rimkus et al.). Four
and seven genes were found to be significantly associated
with death event using respectively local false discovery
rate (lFDR < 0.05) and q-value (qval < 0.05) methods
(Supplemental Figures 4a and 4b). Over-expression of

From genes and response mechanisms to new
ideas for therapy?

Multivariate analysis

We utilized a systems biology approach to gain at
least preliminary hypotheses of the mechanisms that could
be involved in differential patients’ response to therapy.
The network analysis performed on AKR1C3, CXCL10
and IDO1 showed that these three genes are not directly
connected but participate in a network of 33 genes with
80 interactions (Figure 2). The pathway analysis of the
entire network reveals that the immune system pathway is
enriched (p = 3.64E-07) and involves the most part of the
central nodes in the network connecting the three genes
(Supplememtal table 3).

We have considered a multivariate linear model
to relate AKR1C3, CXCL10 and IDO1 to the variables
with 100% of values available for each paper (Batch,
Age, Sex, pT, LN, Metastases and Response). Multiplicity
corrections have been performed using Holm-Bonferroni
method to control the family wise error rate. A test
was deemed significant if the corresponding adjusted
p-value was below 0.05. We found that AKR1C3
showed a statistical significant decrease if the observations
belong to pT(1) (estimate -1.928e+09, corrected

shown in the legend.

We then used “The Comparative Toxicogenomics
Database” CTD, to highlight which known chemical
compound targets the genes of the previously built
network (Figure 3, panel a). Benzo(a)pyrene, quercetin
and nickel sulfate are the only ones targeting all three
signature genes. Drugs traditionally used in the adjuvant
treatment of rectal cancer were reported in the network
dependencies: capecitabine, 5-fluorouracil (both targeting
AKR1C3), irinotecan and oxaliplatin (Figure 3 panel b)

been performed. A network of 69 nodes with 157 edges

DISCUSSION
Clinically, preoperative chemoradiotherapy, is
the worldwide standard regime for locally advanced
rectal cancer. However, the therapy outcome is very
heterogeneous, and ineffective therapy is time-consuming,
economically ineffective, and leads to increased morbidity.
Therefore, reliable prediction of therapy response by
novel approaches is urgently awaited. In the past, gene

system is increasingly taking on the characteristics of a
double-edge sword. In particular the Infiltrating Immune
Cells (IIC) seems to, directly and indirectly, supply a series
of mediators able to sustain tumor unchecked proliferation
and to interfere with prognosis and treatment response.
In the present de novo meta-analysis study, we found
three genes: CXCL10, IDO1 and AKR1C3 associated to
chemo-resistance in rectal cancer patients. These genes
showed a common involvement in the immune system
pathway by performing network analysis. The same
result was obtained for the genes associated to survival.
The adaptive immune system has been described to be
involved in colorectal carcinogenesis and it has been
already correlated to survival [30].
Of note, the three chemokines CXCL11, CXCL10,
and CXCL9 were all found to be upregulated in therapy
responders. These interferon-regulated CXC-family
cytokines all bind to the same receptor, CXCR3[Gene
ID: 2833], which is expressed on TH1-type T-cells and
endothelial cells [31]. These cytokines, most prominently
CXCL10 (IP-10), are involved in chemotaxis of monocyte
and anti-tumoral TH1-type T-lymphocytes, in the regulation
of cell growth and have been described to inhibit
angiostasis. For cell-mediated immunity, CXCL10 exerts
a powerful thymus-dependent antitumor effect [32] and
several studies have established a prominent role for NK
cells in CXCL10-mediated antitumor activity [33].
Therefore, a deregulation of chemokine modulation
in leukocyte recruitment might favour cancer promotion.
For example, impaired production of CXCL10 might be
the basis of decreased immune responses at sites of chronic
inflammation that lead to neoplastic transformation [34]
and more aggressive phenotypes. Low expression of
CXCL10 has been previously associated with survival in
stage II and III colorectal cancers and it could be used
as a marker to better characterize high risk patients and
maximize the benefits of adjuvant therapy [35]. Moreover,
high CXCL10 mRNA expression is associated with a
better tumor response to pCRT in LARC patients and may
predict the outcome of pCRT in this malignancy [36]. It is
noteworthy that the immune system was described as the
main player in more than one part of this study. It is now
well known that a chronically inflamed microenvironment,
immune escape and immunosuppression are mechanisms
intertwined with cancer development, to the point of
being recognized as “immune hallmarks of cancer” [37].
Our results highlight the importance of a correct immune
response in rectal cancer, and confirm the role of immune
related pathways in modeling different responses to the
same treatment [38]. Consistently with our results, the
study of Zumwalt et al. [39] revealed that transcriptional
expression and secretion of CXCR3 and CCR5, cognate
chemokines, correlate with CD8+ T-cell infiltration
and prolonged survival in colorectal cancer. Similarly,
Sconocchia et al. [40] assessed that NK cell and CD8+
T cell crosstalk in the tumor microenvironment may

expression profiling has been used to define biomarkers
for tumor response to pCRT by several groups. However,
single-center studies rely on relatively low case numbers,
leading to very limited levels of overlap between the
findings, as our own results demonstrate for three recent
studies (Supplemental Table 1). Therefore, we have chosen
here a new approach based on de novo bioinformatics
analysis of the original data, a powerful strategy for
the generation of new potential biomarkers for therapy
response stratification.
Firstly, an interesting things approaching to
this manuscript is that none of our predictive genes
are consistent with other comparable studies before
mentioned. This apparent discrepancy in results, is mainly
due to the high heterogeneity in a series of parameters
including: number of patients enrolled, studies design
and methods, primary end-point, treatment’s protocol,
criteria used for evaluation of treatment response,
microarray platform and statistic tools. For example,
Debucquoy et al. while using our similar approach, treat
LARC patients with a primary end-point of evaluating the
efficacy of a COX-2 inhibitor combined with canonical
chemoradiotherapy. Instead, Ghadimi et al. used both a
different therapeutic treatment protocol and responders/
non-responders evaluation method with our same primary
scope. Conversely, Watanabe et al. and BrettinghamMoore et al. studies is the most comparable works in term
of study design and practical approach. Watanabe et al.
enrolled fifty-two rectal patients who underwent pCRT and
through microarray genes expression profile identified a
signature of 33 differently expressed genes discriminating
responders from non-responders patients. The list of
discriminating genes included growth factor, apoptosis,
cell proliferation, signal transduction, or cell adhesion–
related genes but none are in common with our findings.
Brettingham-Moore et al. highlight how the result
obtained with microarray approach fail to reach a sufficient
sensitivity and specificity in stratifying responders from
non-responders patients, with a poor predictive power,
reproducibility and a high rate of false-positive. However,
using an alternative computational approach they found
that a particular biological pathway was principally
involved and high correlated to patient’s response to
treatment: the TNF/NF-kB pathway. Consistently with
our result they found that inflammation, especially which
involved in tumor microenvironment, often cooperate with
a complex network of signals determining sensitivity to
chemoradiotherapy.
Secondly, the results here presented support the
growing evidence of tumor microenvironment (TME)
involvement in neoplastic progression [29]. While some
aspects of TME are now well characterized such as tumor
angiogenesis sustaining and reshaping of extracellular
matrix, the impact of TME on tumor grown, progression
and response to therapy is still not fully clarified. In this
landscape, the intersection between tumor and immune

benefit patient outcome and further, that the enumeration
of infiltrating NK and CD8+ T cells in CRC tumors may
provide useful prognostic information.
The importance of CXCL10 and CXCL9 in the
generation of an efficient antitumor immune response is
further supported by their prominent role as mediators of
the antitumor effect of IL-12[Gene ID: 3593], which is
known as a potent immunoregulatory cytokine mediating
tumor regression in a variety of tumor models [33, 41].
IDO1 is a fundamental enzyme in the tryptophan
catabolism pathway and the data available in literature
appear conflicting. A study on IDO1 expression in
primary colorectal tumours demonstrated that higher
IDO1 expression at the tumour invasion front correlates
with progressive disease and impaired clinical outcome. At
stage-III colorectal cancer patients, decisions for adjuvant
treatment are weighed against possible side effects in
patients with important comorbidity and the analysis
of IDO1 expression at the tumour invasion front was
suggested to be of additional value in the decision process
[42]. Moreover, IDO1 has been demonstrated to promote
colitis-associated tumorigenesis in mice, independent of
its ability to limit T-cell–mediated immune surveillance. In
the mechanism proposed, IDO1 regulates the suppression
of tumor-reactive effector T cells and promotes the
regulation of T cell activation limiting tumor immunesurveillance and thus facilitating tumor progression.
Concurrently, it stimulates proliferation in the neoplastic
epithelium through activated nuclear b-catenin [43].
AKR1C3 is an aldo–keto reductase that has been
described as responsible for gaining resistance against
cisplatin treatment when overexpressed in colon cancer
cells together with AKR1C1[Gene ID: 1645] [44].
AKR1 family genes (C1 and C3) are potential
markers for cisplatin resistance of colon cancer cells.
In response to oxidative stress including ROS and
electrophiles, Nrf2 is released from the Nrf2–Kelch-like
ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1 [Gene ID: 9817])
complex by modification of Cys in Keap1. Nrf2 translocates
into the nucleus to binds antioxidant response elements,
inducing a variety of phase II enzymes involved in drug
metabolism, such as NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase-1,
heme oxygenase-1 and the AKRs (1C1, 1C2, 1C3 and
1B10) [45, 46].
Since cisplatin induces oxidative stress, it has
been suggested that the over-expression of AKR1C1 and
AKR1C3 in cisplatin resistance cells results induced from
Nrf2 activation through continuous formation of ROS and
HNE. The positive relationship between the up-regulation
of the two AKRs and the development of cisplatin
resistance, seems to indicate that high expression of AKR1
genes (C1 and C3) is a crucial factor in the ineffectiveness
of cisplatin therapy for colon cancer.
Drugs used in the adjuvant treatment of rectal cancer
(capecitabine, fluorouracil, irinotecan and oxaliplatin)
are present in the network connecting the three genes
(Figure 3, panel b).
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

A search for compounds that target all three genes
pointed at benzo(a)pyrene, nickel sulfate and quercetine.
Benzo(a)pyrene has been linked to colorectal cancer
development [47] while nickel sulfate is a known
carcinogen [48]. On the contrary quercetin has been
associated to colorectal cancer prevention and treatment
of rectal and ileal adenomas [49, 50]. A further analysis
on the interactions revealed that the two carcinogens
induce the expression of the three genes while quercetin
induces the expression of IDO1 but inhibits the expression
of CXCL10 and AKR1C3. As IDO1 is up-regulated and
AKR1C3 is down-regulated in responders, quercetin might
be a good candidate in support to adjuvant chemotherapy
in non-responders patients.
Interestingly, STAT1[Gene ID: 6772], NFKB1[Gene
ID: 4790] and JUN[Gene ID: 3725] genes, three crucial
signaling molecules in cancer cells, have been further
identified as common targets of the three compounds.
The enrichment of the immune system pathway was
confirmed also considering the six genes targeted by the
three compounds (p = 0.0228). Notably, STAT1, NFKB1
and JUN are also targeted by irinotecan while fluorouracil
targets NFKB1 and JUN and oxaliplatin targets JUN.
The present study furthermore, allowed the
identification of a subclass of genes related to survival.
Among these genes, INPP1 in particular stands out
for which its overexpression is positively correlated to
death-event. The over expression in colorectal cancer of
INPP1 was primary described by Bustin and colleagues
[51]. This gene produces an important enzyme involved
in the Inositol signaling pathway that play a crucial role
in cellular proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis
[52, 53]. INPP1 belongs to a class of hydrolases acting
specifically on position 1 phosphate of both InsP2 and
InsP3. The production derived from its catalysis functions
as effector molecule in favor of DNA Polymerase α,
required for the priming of Okazaki fragments during
elongation [54], increasing its fidelity and activity of
replication [55]. A deregulated activity of INPP1 has also
been demonstrated in colorectal cancer and in prostate
cancer, where it has been proposed as therapeutic target
[56]. In concert with our data, we speculate that an overactivation of INPP1, besides increasing the activity and
stability of DNA Polymerase α promotes cancer cell
replication, stimulates the generation of some second
messengers such as diacylglycerol and InsP3 which are
important in the activation of protein kinase C, responsible
for survival and propagation of proliferation-enhancing
stimuli.
Another noteworthy gene is CYB5D1, which
encodes for a protein belonging to the family of Hpr6,
which was found to increase the resistance of tumor cells
to DNA damaging agents [57]. This study is the first, up to
now, that positively correlates overexpression of CYB5D1
with an increased patients risk. In fact, CYB5D1 was
already decribed in the study of breast and other cancer
but its expression levels negatively correlates with patients

Surgical excision has been performed six weeks after
pCRT. In the two original studies, patients showing
tumor regression grades 1–2 and 3–4 of the Mandard
classification [61] were classified as responders and nonresponders, respectively.
Kim et al. [18] used tumor tissues obtained from
46 patients with LARC. All patients were treated with
radiotherapy with 50.4 Gy, followed by surgical excision
six weeks later. The response to chemoradiotherapy
was evaluated according to Dworak’s tumor regression
grade: grades 1–2 were considered non-responders, while
grades 3–4 were considered as responders [62]. The main
information for each study has been reported (Table 3). All
genes ID have been retrieved from NCBI Gene database

survival, suggesting an opposing effects, which may be
tumor-type specific [58, 59].
With respect to down-regulated genes, SLC26A2
alias DTD or DTDS, is an interesting gene, which
positively correlated with death-event. This gene encodes
for a protein responsible of sulfate transport across
membrane. In cancer cell and especially in colorectal
cancer cell, we assist to an impaired sulfation that occurs
during the course of malignant transformation of colonic
epithelium. A study proposed by Kannagi and colleagues
demonstrated that cultured colorectal cancer cells have
a markedly reduced expression of DTDST and the
down expression dramatically increased growth rate and
proliferation of cancer cells [60].
In conclusion, our study paves the way for an
original approach in order to facing the dramatic increase
of high throughput generated data. In fact, we must
consider that the increasing use of high throughput assays
shifted research from hypothesis-driven exploration to
data-driven hypothesis generation, in this scenario an
effective tool as A-MADMAN algorithm allow a fast,
comprehensive and reliable statistical method to analyze
heterogeneous data, coming from different analytical
platforms. All these arguments suggest that new ideas
for therapy, as well as new tools for patient stratification
according to the individual molecular genetic risk profile
could be found studying genes and mechanisms associated
to therapy response.

Data retrieval, annotation, integration and
quality control
We used A-MADMAN web application for
retrieving, annotating, organizing and analysing gene
expression datasets of meta-analysis, originating from
Affymetrix data. Interestingly, A-MADMAN allows
the integrative analysis of data obtained from different
Affymetrix platforms through a custom workflow by
minimizing inter-series and inter-studies variability
biases. This is based on the Robust Multichip Average
(RMA) method [63] implemented in the Bioconductor
R package ‘affy’, using GeneAnnote-based custom CDF
[64]. Oligonucleotides common to all platforms were
selected and each array was transformed into a virtual
chip containing only the common probes. Background
correction was applied for each platform before the
oligonucleotides selection, while the summarization and
the quantile normalization by RMA were performed only
on shared probes.
R pamr package (CRAN Comprehensive R Archive
Network; http://cran.r-project.org) was applied after
normalization to remove batch effects.
Three series of Affymetrix data were downloaded
and a total of 131 patients were considered. The data were
obtained from two different generations of Affymetrix
gene chip technologies that were not directly comparable:
Human Genome U133A was used by Kim et al., while
Human Genome U133 plus2.0 GeneChip Array was used
by Rimkus et al. and Agostini et al.
Raw data (CEL files) and related metadata were
imported and clinical and pathological information

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Gene expression datasets selection
In this study, three different gene expression
datasets of pCRT-treated patients with LARC have been
investigated. A total of 131 patient have been included.
Only data belonging to original samples with > 70% of
tumor cells and a comparable pCRT treatment protocol
were used in our meta-analysis. Rimkus et al. [19] used
43 biopsy specimens of LARC patients receiving a pCRT
standardized protocol: 45 Gy, 5-fluorouracil - 250 mg/m2/
continuously followed by surgical resection six weeks
later.
Agostini et al. (in press [20]) used tumor tissue
obtained from 42 patients with LARC. All patients
received pCRT using the standardized protocol as follow:
45–50.4 Gy; 5-fluorouracil - 225 mg/m2/continuously.

(age, sex, ethnicity, primary tumor site, stage, tumor
grade) were used to build a local database, as previously
described [24]. Briefly, metadata were associated to each
sample as descriptive labels (tags) to subset samples into
homogenous groups.
A quality check of the expression data was applied
using a customized version of ArrayQualityMetrics
Bioconductor package in R statistics environment
(BioConductor, http://www.bioconductor.org) to discard
those samples that were marked as outliers in more
than two Quality Control (QC) metrics. Specifically,
two main Probe-Level Method-based quality statistics,
such as: Normalized Unscaled Standard Error (NUSE)
with Relative Log Expression (RLE), and a QC
metric recommend by Affymetrix (QC stats) were
used to evaluate the overall quality of signals in each
array. MA-plot before and after RMA was performed
to identify biases associated with specific intensity
classes [65].
By the A-MADMAN web interface, all samples
were meta-analysed to derive an integrated gene
expression matrix.

investigated the two databases to identify survival-related
genes using “shrinkage t” statistics and “st” R package.

TCGA data set analysis
Data from TCGA pilot project established by the
NCI and NHGR were explored (22nd June 2015) for
AKR1C3 and IDO1 expression in the TCGA colorectal
cancer series. Information about TCGA and the
investigators and institutions that constitute the TCGA
research network can be found at “http://cancergenome.
nih.gov”. Oncomine algorithms were used for the
statistical analysis of the differences in AKR1C3 and
IDO1 mRNA expression [66]. TCGA data series were
grouped by Residual tumor, a parameter that reflects the
effects of treatment as described by Hermanek et al. [28].
Briefly, R0 were considered complete/good response while
R1 and R2 bad/absent response.

Network Analysis
The biological role of selected genes, which enable
the discrimination of two groups, is better characterized
through an in-depth analysis of the molecular pathways
in which they are involved. In this regard, we utilized a
series of tools in order to investigated different biological
network at different level: a) protein-protein interactions
(PPIs) and enrichment analysis; b) common microRNAs
interactions; c) common interaction with drugs.
The selected genes were initially characterized
by retrieving physical PPIs from “I2D database ve,
creating a PPI network that was visualized and analyzed
in “NAViGaTOR 2.3 [67]”. We further performed a
functional annotation and enrichment analysis of the
network proteins using the built in pathway plugin, a
study of the microRNAs targeting the PPI network using
“mirDIP 1.1” [68], and a study of the drugs targeting
the same network using (CTD). Moreover, to prioritize
microRNAs in the network, data from published studies
on response to neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy and
microRNA signatures were collected [69–71].

Gene Expression Profiling
Statistical analyses were performed using the opensource R System software [The R Project for Statistical
Computing,
ver.2.12.2,
http://www.r-project.org],
BioConductor package [ver.2.7] and dChip software,
including 12,167 probe sets and 85 samples resulting
from annotation, integration and QC procedures above
described.
Genes with low expression variation across all
samples have been discarded using interquartile range
(IQR) as filtering criteria; as a result, subsequent analysis
has been performed using a total of 277 filtered probe sets.
A significance analysis of microarray (SAM) has
been performed to find differentially expressed genes
between responders (R) and non-responders (NR) groups.
Less than one false positive-rated gene was found using
false discovery rate (FDR) < 1% and q-value = 0 as
cutoffs.
Shrunken centroid algorithm was further performed
using Tibshirani’s class prediction analysis of microarrays
(PAM). The ‘multtest’ package was used for multiplicity
control as described in Pollard, K. S., Gilbert, H. N., Ge, Y.,
Taylor, S. & Dudoit, S. (2011), multtest:
Resampling-based multiple hypothesis testing.
The false discovery rate (FDR) has been calculated
by the Benjamini–Hochberg procedure and statistical
threshold for significance was set to p = 0.05.
The functional annotation of gene lists derived from
the above described analysis was performed by the DAVID
(Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated
Discovery) [web-tool: http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov/].
Survival data, available for 55 samples in two out of
three original studies (Table 1) were considered also. We
