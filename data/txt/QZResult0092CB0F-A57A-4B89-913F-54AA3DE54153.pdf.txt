BACKGROUND: In patients with high-risk neuroblastoma, the reduction in primary tumor volume was measured during the early
phase of induction chemotherapy as an indicator of early tumor response, and the authors investigated whether the degree of tumor
volume reduction could predict outcome in these patients. METHODS: Primary tumor volumes were measured both at diagnosis and
at the first tumor response evaluation (after 2 or 3 cycles of induction chemotherapy) in 90 patients with high-risk neuroblastoma
who had volumetrically evaluable computed tomography or magnetic resonance scans. If the tumor volume at the first response evaluation was >40% of the initial tumor volume, then the patient was categorized as a poor responder; otherwise, the patient was categorized as a good responder. Outcomes were compared according to the degree of tumor volume reduction at the first response
evaluation. RESULTS: The tumor volume reduction was greater in patients who remained relapse free than in patients who had a
relapsed tumor (median percentage tumor volume, 21% vs 41.5%; P ¼ .037). The 5-year relapse-free survival rate was higher in the
good responders than in the poor responders (83% [95% confidence interval, 72%-94%] vs 51% [95% confidence interval, 31%-71%];
P ¼ .002). In a multivariate analysis of relapse-free survival, a poor early response was identified as an independent, unfavorable prognostic factor (hazard ratio, 4.24; 95% confidence interval, 1.59-11.29; P ¼ .004). CONCLUSIONS: A greater reduction in tumor
volume reduction the early phase of induction chemotherapy was associated with a better outcome in patients with high-risk neuroblastoma. Tailoring treatment intensity according to the early tumor response to induction chemotherapy may improve patient outC 2012 American Cancer Society.

INTRODUCTION
The morphologic response in bone marrow during the early phase of induction chemotherapy is a predictor of outcomes in
childhood leukemias.1-4 The degree of tumor necrosis after preoperative chemotherapy also is predictive of event-free survival and overall survival in patients with bone tumors.5,6 In patients with neuroblastoma, the Children’s Cancer Group
reported that quantitative tumor content of both bone marrow and blood after a few cycles of chemotherapy was prognostic.7 In addition, researchers observed that early metastatic response, as determined by 131I-metaiodobenzylguanidine/123Imetaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) scanning, was correlated with outcome.8-11 However, these measures evaluated only the
response of metastatic tumors and were applicable only to patients with bone marrow metastasis or MIBG-avid tumors.
The standard treatment for high-risk neuroblastoma consists of induction treatment, high-dose chemotherapy
(HDCT), autologous stem cell transplantation (autoSCT) as a consolidation treatment, and 13-cis-retinoid acid treatment to reduce relapse from minimal residual disease. Induction treatment consists of conventional chemotherapy and
surgery with or without radiotherapy. In many patients with high-risk neuroblastoma, the tumor is inoperable at diagnosis, and definitive surgery is postponed until after preoperative chemotherapy.
In the current study, we hypothesized that a better early tumor response to induction chemotherapy may be associated with a better outcome in patients with high-risk neuroblastoma. We measured the degree of tumor volume reduction
in the primary tumor during the early phase of induction chemotherapy as an indicator of early tumor response and investigated whether it could predict outcome.

Induction Chemotherapy

In the early period of this study (diagnosis by December
2003), patients underwent definitive surgery after 5 cycles
of induction chemotherapy.14,15 The combined cisplatin,
etoposide, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide (CEDC)
regimen was used for induction chemotherapy (Table 1).
Overall, patients received 6 to 12 cycles of chemotherapy
before HDCT/autoSCT. In the late period (diagnosis
from January 2004), patients underwent definitive surgery after 6 cycles of chemotherapy. The CEDC regimen
and the ifosfamide, carboplatin, and etoposide regimen
were used in an alternating manner. Overall, patients
received 9 or 10 cycles of chemotherapy before HDCT/
autoSCT.14,15

excluded. Patients were staged according to the International Neuroblastoma Staging System.12 Amplification of
v-myc myelocytomatosis viral-related oncogene, neuroblastoma derived (avian) (MYCN) was determined using
Southern blot analysis or quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis. Tumors were
classified as histologically favorable or unfavorable according to the International Neuroblastoma Pathology Classification.13 Stage 4 tumors in patients aged >1 year and
any MYCN-amplified tumors were stratified as high-risk
tumors. This retrospective study was approved by the
Samsung Medical Center Institutional Review Board.
Informed consent was waived by the Institutional Review
Board.

In the early period, patients received local radiotherapy to
the primary site only if gross residual tumor remained after surgery. However, in the late period, all patients
received local radiotherapy to the primary site after the
second HDCT/autoSCT.14,15

Patients received differentiation therapy with 13-cis-retinoic acid plus immunotherapy using interleukin-2 for 1
year after HDCT/autoSCT to reduce relapse from possible minimal residual tumor cells.14,15
Tumor Volume Measurement

The primary tumor volume was measured at diagnosis
and at the first response evaluation after 2 cycles (in the
early period) or 3 cycles (in the late period) of induction
chemotherapy. To calculate the tumor volume on CT and
MR scans, we used axial, contrast-enhanced CT scans and
fat-suppressed, contrast-enhanced, T1-weighted MR
images. We viewed the CT scans with a window level of
10 and a window width of 450. By consensus, 2 radiologists defined the tumor areas by manually drawing on each
slice of stacked CT and MR images. The tumor volume
was then calculated from the sum of the areas on the
images multiplied by the slice thickness using computer
software (Advantage Workstation, Volume Share version
2.0; GE Healthcare, Madison, Wis). The absolute tumor
volume and the percentage tumor volume at the first
response evaluation compared with the initial tumor volume were calculated (Fig. 1). Encased vessels within
tumors were included in tumor volume measurement in
most patients. However, cases in which large vessels and/
or other organs (pancreas, kidney, vertebra, etc) present in
658

MIBG scores were determined as previously described.16
In brief, the body was divided into 9 segments (head,
chest, thoracic spine, lumbar spine, pelvis, upper arms,
lower arms, femurs, and lower legs) to view osteomedullary involvement and a tenth general sector that included
any soft tissue involvement. The extension score was
graded as follows: 0 indicated no MIBG involvement; 1, 1
MIBG-avid lesion present; 2, more than 1 MIBG-avid
lesion present; and 3, diffuse involvement (>50% of the
segment). The absolute score was obtained by adding the
scores of all the segments. The relative score was calculated
by dividing the absolute score at the tumor response evaluation by the corresponding overall score at diagnosis.
Response Criteria

International response criteria were used to evaluate treatment response.13 Briefly, a complete response was defined
as no identifiable tumor with a normal catecholamine
level. A very good partial response was defined as a
decrease between 90% and 99% in the primary tumor
volume with a normal catecholamine level with or without any residual 99Tc bone changes. A partial response
was defined as a reduction >50% in the primary and metastatic tumors. A mixed response was defined as a reduction >50% in any measurable lesion with a reduction
<50% in any other lesion. Progressive disease (PD) was
defined as any new lesion or an increase >25% in any
measurable lesion.
Degree of Cytopenia During the First
Chemotherapy Cycle

We investigated whether the degree of cytopenia during
the first chemotherapy cycle (which was the CEDC regimen in all patients), used as an indicator of intrinsic
patient cellular characteristics, also was related to tumor
response. We analyzed the relations between various hematologic parameters at the nadir during the first chemotherapy cycle and the degree of tumor volume reduction
at the first response evaluation.
Statistics

If the tumor volume at the first response evaluation was
>40% of the initial tumor volume, then the patient was
categorized as a poor responder; otherwise, the patient
was categorized as a good responder. The percentage tumor volume at the first response evaluation was compared
between the groups using the Mann-Whitney U test or
the Kruskal-Wallis test. The survival rate and 95%

confidence interval (CI) were determined using the
Kaplan-Meier method. An event was defined as the occurrence of relapse, progression, or treatment-related mortality. Differences in survival rates between the 2 groups
were compared using the log-rank test. Multivariate analyses for relapse-free survival and event-free survival were
performed using Cox regression analysis. P values < .05
were considered significant.

Parameter

Patient Characteristics

In total, 120 patients were newly diagnosed with high-risk
neuroblastoma during the study period. Fourteen patients
who underwent surgery before initiation of chemotherapy, 12 patients who had CT/MR scans with which volumetry was impossible, 2 patients with unknown primary
sites, and 2 patients who were transferred to other hospitals before response evaluation were excluded. Therefore,
90 high-risk patients were included in the study. Twentyseven of these patients were diagnosed in the early study
period, and the remaining 63 patients were diagnosed in
the late study period. Table 2 lists the clinical and biologic
characteristics of the patients.
Treatment and Outcome

Tumors progressed in 3 patients, and treatment-related
mortality occurred in 1 patient during the induction treatment; therefore, 86 patients completed induction treatment. Response evaluation at the end of induction
revealed a complete response in 42 patients, a very good
partial response in 25, a partial response in 18 patients,
and a mixed response in 1 patient. All patients but 1 who
refused HDCT/autoSCT proceeded to the first HDCT/
autoSCT. However, 12 patients could not proceed to the
second HDCT/autoSCT because of treatment-related
mortality during the first HDCT/autoSCT (n ¼ 3), myocarditis during the first HDCT/autoSCT (n ¼ 1), tumor
progression after the first HDCT/autoSCT (n ¼ 1), and
refusal of the second HDCT/autoSCT (n ¼ 7). The
remaining 73 patients proceeded to the second HDCT/
autoSCT as scheduled at diagnosis. There was no difference in the proportion of patients who completed tandem
HDCT/autoSCT between good responders and poor responders (82% vs 78%, respectively; P ¼ .679). Tumors
relapsed or progressed in 15 patients after the second
HDCT/autoSCT. Treatment-related mortality occurred
during the second HDCT/autoSCT in 7 patients and
during follow-up after HDCT/autoSCT in 1 patient.
Overall, tumors relapsed or progressed in 20 patients, and
treatment-related mortality occurred in 12 patients.

Consistent with these results, tumors relapsed or progressed in 8 of 62 good responders (13%) compared with
12 of 28 poor responders (43%; P ¼ .011). In contrast,
treatment-related mortality occurred in 10 of 62 good

P ¼ .328). In particular, all 8 events of treatment-related
mortality during or after the second HDCT/autoSCT

Association Between Tumor Volume Reduction
and Metaiodobenzylguanidine Scores

The median MIBG extension scores at diagnosis in
good and poor responders were 18.5 (range, 1-27)
and 11 (range, 1-27), respectively (P ¼ .836). The
absolute and relative MIBG scores at the first
response evaluation were lower in good responders
662

than in poor responders with borderline significance
(P ¼ .089 and P ¼ .058, respectively) (Table 5).
However, the differences became significant after 5
or 6 cycles of induction chemotherapy (P ¼ .001
and P ¼ .001, respectively) (Table 5).

It is noteworthy that the white blood cell count at the nadir during the first chemotherapy cycle was lower in good
responders than in poor responders (median, 220/lL vs
400/lL, respectively; P ¼ .005), although there was no
difference in the frequency of bone marrow metastasis
between the 2 groups (62% vs 71%, respectively; P ¼
.372). Similarly, the absolute neutrophil count at the nadir was lower in good responders than in poor responders
(median, 51/lL vs 160/lL, respectively; P < .001), and
the duration of neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count,
<500/lL) also was longer in good responders than in
poor responders with borderline significance (median, 6
days vs 5 days, respectively; P ¼ .068). However, there
were no differences in hemoglobin or platelet counts at
the nadir between the 2 groups (P ¼ .170 and P ¼ .796),
because erythrocytes and platelets were transfused if
hemoglobin and platelet counts fell below 8.0 g/dL and
20,000/lL, respectively.

Tumor Volume Reduction Predicts Outcome/Yoo et al

DISCUSSION
Several researchers have searched for a sensitive measure
of early response to therapy that would be capable of predicting later response and survival in patients with neuroblastoma. Some studies have reported that early
metastatic response detected by immunohistochemical examination of bone marrow or MIBG scanning after a few
cycles of induction chemotherapy was correlated with outcome.7-11 However, these measures evaluated only the
response of metastatic tumors, and not the response of
primary tumors. In addition, some patients with stage 4
disease do not have bone marrow metastasis, and approximately 10% of patients have MIBG-nonavid tumors.17,18
Therefore, a response evaluation using these methods is
applicable only to patients who have bone marrow metastasis or MIBG-avid tumors. In contrast, our method also
can be applied in patients who have nonmetastatic or
MIBG-nonavid tumors, because it evaluates the response
of primary tumors, and not the response of metastatic
tumors. To our knowledge, this is the first study suggesting that the degree of volume reduction in the primary tumor as an indicator of early tumor response is an
independent prognostic factor in patients with high-risk
neuroblastoma.
Tailoring treatment intensity according to the early
response in bone marrow during induction chemotherapy
improved the prognosis of patients with childhood acute
lymphoblastic leukemia.19,20 In some current chemotherapy protocols for childhood acute lymphoblastic
leukemia, the treatment intensity after induction chemotherapy is tailored according to the minimal residual disease status of the bone marrow during the early phase or at
the end of induction chemotherapy.21 Emerging results
from those trials suggest that the adverse prognostic
impact of minimal residual disease during the early phases
of therapy can be diminished by treatment intensification.
However, in neuroblastoma, the same treatment was
received by all patients with the same risk after stratification into a certain risk group at diagnosis. In the current
study, all patients were assigned to receive tandem
HDCT/autoSCT at diagnosis, and >80% of patients
completed treatment as scheduled. Our survival rates are
very encouraging compared with those in previous studies
that used a single HDCT/autoSCT strategy.22,23 We
believe that these encouraging results are generally attributable to further dose escalation with the tandem HDCT/
autoSCT strategy. However, many good responders died
from treatment-related toxicities, particularly during the
second HDCT/autoSCT, although the relapse rate was
relatively low in these patients. These findings suggest

that good responders may benefit from treatment de-escalation, thus sparing them from treatment-related toxicities. Conversely, the relapse rate remained high in the
poor responders even after tandem HDCT/autoSCT;
therefore, a more intensified treatment or the addition of
another treatment modality may be needed to reduce the
relapse rate in these patients. Our results suggest that tailoring treatment intensity according to the early tumor
response may further improve the outcomes of patients
with high-risk neuroblastoma.
It is very interesting that the degree of tumor volume
reduction was higher in MYCN-amplified tumors or undifferentiated tumors than in their counterparts. MYCN
amplification and undifferentiated histology are known as
independent, unfavorable prognostic factors in neuroblastoma.24,25 However, these factors may lose their prognostic relevance in high-risk patients who receive intensive
treatment, as in our study. Indeed, MYCN amplification
and undifferentiated histology were not identified as
unfavorable factors for relapse-free survival in the current
study. These findings may be explained in part by the better early responses of MYCN-amplified tumors or undifferentiated tumors. Tumors with unfavorable features,
such as a high mitotic index, may be more sensitive to
chemotherapy than their counterparts.
We hypothesized that the intrinsic cellular characteristics of patients (eg, pharmacogenetic characteristics)
that are shared by tumor cells also may affect the tumor
response. Therefore, we investigated whether the degree
of cytopenia during the first chemotherapy cycle, as an indicator of the intrinsic cellular characteristics of the
patients who responded to chemotherapy, was related to
tumor response. It is noteworthy that leukopenia and neutropenia during the first chemotherapy cycle were more
severe in good responders than in poor responders. These
findings suggest that the intrinsic cellular characteristics of
patients also may affect tumor response, and treatment
needs to be tailored according to the intrinsic cellular
characteristics of patients as well as the characteristics of
tumor cells.
In summary, our study has certain limitations, in
that only patients with high-risk neuroblastoma were analyzed, and the patients received different therapies over
the study period. In addition, the timing of the first
response evaluation differed among patients. Nonetheless,
the current findings suggest that a greater tumor volume
reduction during the early phase of induction chemotherapy may be associated with a better outcome in patients
with high-risk neuroblastoma. Our findings also suggest
that tailoring treatment intensity according to the early
663

tumor response may improve the outcomes of these highrisk patients. Further studies with larger cohorts of
patients who receive uniform treatment will be necessary
to confirm our findings.
