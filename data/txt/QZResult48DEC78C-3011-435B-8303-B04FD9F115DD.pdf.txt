Abstract
Cells carrying mutated BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes are defective
in DNA repair by homologous recombination and, as a
consequence, are highly sensitive to inhibitors of poly
(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). This provides the basis for
a novel ‘‘synthetic lethal’’ approach to cancer therapy. We have
recently shown that this sensitivity can be reversed, and
resistance to PARP inhibition can be acquired by deletion of
a mutation in BRCA2. Furthermore, a similar mechanism
seems to be associated with carboplatin resistance in some
BRCA2 mutation carriers with ovarian cancer. [Cancer Res
2008;68(24):10021–3]

Carriers of heterozygous germ-line mutations in the BRCA1 or
BRCA2 genes are strongly predisposed to cancer of the breast,
ovary, and other organs (1). BRCA1 and BRCA2 proteins are
critically important for the repair of double strand breaks (DSB) by
homologous recombination (HR) and loss of the wild-type BRCA1
or BRCA2 allele in tumors likely fosters cancer progression by
promoting genome instability and mutation (2). We have developed
therapeutic strategies based on exploiting this specific DNA repair
defect. First, following up on observations that BRCA1- or BRCA2deficient cells in culture were very sensitive to DNA cross-linking
agents, we have established a clinical trial to test the hypothesis
that tumors arising in BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers show
enhanced sensitivity to carboplatin (3). Our second approach has
used the principle of synthetic lethality. Synthetic lethality is
defined as the situation when mutation in either of two genes
individually has no effect but combining the mutations leads to
death (4). This effect was first described over 60 years ago in
studies on the fruit fly (5). The implication of synthetic lethality for
therapeutic strategies is that targeting one such genes in a cancer
where the other is defective should be selectively lethal to the
tumor cells but not toxic to the normal cells. In principle, this
should lead to a large therapeutic window (4).
We and others showed that BRCA1 or BRCA2 deficiency, as well
as deficiency in other HR components, profoundly sensitizes cells
to killing by potent inhibitors of the enzyme poly(ADP-ribose)
polymerase (PARP), such as KU0058948 (6–8).
We hypothesized that inhibition of PARP would lead to the
persistence of DNA lesions that would normally be repaired by
BRCA2-mediated HR. Therefore, PARP inhibitors (PARPi) could be
selectively lethal to cells lacking functional BRCA1 or BRCA2 but
be associated with minimal toxicity to normal cells. This synthetic
lethal interaction between PARP and BRCA1 or BRCA2 suggested a
potential new mechanism-based approach for the treatment of

patients with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation–associated cancers. In
these patients, tumor cells lack normal BRCA1 or BRCA2 function,
but normal tissues retain a single normal copy of the relevant gene
potentially providing a large ‘‘therapeutic window’’ and reduced side
effects. A number of clinical trials have been developed to test the
efficacy of this approach. The potent PARPi KU-0059436/AZD2281
(AstraZeneca) is currently being tested in a phase I trial. Preliminary
observations in BRCA mutation carriers with ovarian cancer
suggest low toxicities with some promising indications of response
measured radiologically and using tumor markers (9). Phase II trials
of KU-0059436/AZD2281 as a single agent for the treatment of
breast and ovarian cancers in BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation carriers
are now also under way, and a number of other PARPi are in clinical
development (10). Although these studies are still in their infancy, it
seemed likely that some tumors may be de novo resistant to PARP
inhibition or that they may acquire resistance during treatment. To
model this, we derived PARPi-resistant clones from the human
BRCA2 deficient cell line, CAPAN1 (11).
CAPAN1 cells were originally derived from a pancreatic epithelial
cancer occurring in an individual carrying the protein truncating
frame-shifting c.6174delT BRCA2 mutation. These cells have lost
the wild-type copy of the BRCA2 gene but express a truncated
protein of 2,002 amino acids lacking 1,416 amino acids compared
with the wild-type protein. This truncated protein is missing
important functional domains, and as a result, CAPAN1 cells are
defective in the ability to form DNA damage–induced RAD51
foci and HR and are extremely sensitive to treatment with potent
PARPi (12). To generate cells resistant to PARP inhibition, we
exposed CAPAN1 cells to the potent, drug-like, PARPi KU0058948
(6) and produced multiple independent PARP inhibitor–resistant
(PIR) clones (11). These were all >1,000-fold resistant to PARPi
compared with the parental cell line and had acquired the ability
to form damage-induced RAD51 nuclear foci and limit genomic
instability, both hallmarks of a restored HR pathway. We, therefore,
examined the structure of the BRCA2 gene and protein expressed
in the PIR clones. This revealed the unexpected finding that each of
these clones carried different BRCA2 alleles harboring deletions of
up to 58 kb, all of which result in elimination of the c.6174delT
mutation. Each deletion had different consequences on the
encoded protein, but all restored the open reading frame (ORF)
so that the COOH terminus of the protein was produced in frame
with the NH2 terminus (11). One allele produced a protein with a
small, 153 amino acid deletion, but other alleles encoded proteins
with major (>1,400 amino acid) deletions encompassing 3 RAD51
binding BRC repeats and either all or most of the proposed DNA
Binding Domain (DBD). Notably the restored COOH terminus of
BRCA2 has recently been shown to contain an important RAD51
binding domain (reviewed in ref. 13).
It was formally possible, although unlikely, that the restored
BRCA2 ORF and cellular PARP resistance were coincidental; the
novel alleles had arisen under conditions where DNA repair was
ineffective and after exposure to PARPi likely causing multiple
cellular mutations which could have been responsible. Therefore,

Figure 1. A model for the evolution of resistance to carboplatin in an ovarian cancer of an individual carrying a BRCA2 c.6174delT mutation (11). Most cells in
the tumor (black dots) lack wild-type BRCA2 but express a truncated protein lacking the COOH terminal third of the protein because of the frame-shift mutation.
Occasionally a deletion arises (reversion allele) in the BRCA2 gene in a cell (red dot ), which restores the ORF and reactivates the function of the protein in DNA
repair. Cells deficient in BRCA2 function are effectively killed by the treatment (carboplatin-Pt) because of their DNA repair defect whereas cells with reversion
alleles are not killed and, over time, these predominate causing clinical resistance.

we performed a series of experiments to link the novel alleles to
PARPi resistance (11). These included resensitising PIR clones to
PARPi with BRCA2 siRNA and re-expressing the variant BRCA2
proteins in PARPi-naı̈ve CAPAN1 cells and conferring resistance.
Finally, we were able to show that these truncated proteins were
fully competent, at least in the assay we used, in facilitating HR.
Taken together, these observations implicate the novel BRCA2
proteins present in PIR clones in resistance to PARPi and,
importantly, suggest that this resistance occurs by restoration of
DNA repair by HR. Therefore, we consider these gain-of-function
mutants of BRCA2 to be, at least in part, reversion alleles (11).
The use of potent PARPi for the treatment of BRCA-associated
cancer is still in the early stages of assessment (9), and it is not yet
possible to assess mechanisms of resistance in patient material.
However, ovarian cancer patients who carry BRCA1 or BRCA2
mutations have long been treated with agents such as cisplatin and
carboplatin, which as discussed above are thought to exert their
BRCA-selective effects by a mechanism similar to that of PARPi.
Several reports suggest that ovarian cancer patients who carry
BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations gain more benefit from carboplatin
compared with patients with no family history of the disease, but
resistance does eventually occur (14). Numerous mechanisms of
platinum drug resistance have been proposed (15, 16). To

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (24). December 15, 2008

investigate the mechanism in BRCA2 mutation carriers, we
determined the sequence of the BRCA2 gene in tumor material
from two patients bearing the BRCA2 c.6174delT mutation, whose
ovarian carcinomas progressed on carboplatin treatment. In both
cases, deletions were present downstream of the c.6174delT
mutation, which restored the BRCA2 ORF. Taken together with
our observations in PIR cells, this links these reversion alleles with
clinical resistance to carboplatin. Similar observations were made
by Taniguchi’s group (17).
Over the past few years, resistance to targeted therapy has been
well-documented. The prime example of this is resistance to
imatinib (gleevec) in chronic myelogenous leukemia, a disease
caused by expression of the BCR-ABL fusion protein (18). Here,
resistance occurs via mutation of the drug-binding pocket of the
ABL protein kinase so that imatinib can no longer bind and, as a
consequence, kinase activity cannot be inhibited. The mutations
we observe are different from this paradigm in a number of ways.
First, the reversion alleles we described result in the restoration of a
previously lost function rather than by blocking drug binding.
Second, they constitute deletions, in some cases of very large size,
rather than missense mutations. Finally, mirroring our synthetic
lethal strategy, the resistance inducing mutation is in the synthetic
lethal partner (BRCA2) rather than in the drug target itself (PARP).

Drug Resistance Caused by Reversion Mutation

Our observation that variants of BRCA2 lacking a significant
fraction of the protein including putative functionally important
domains are competent in mediating PARP resistance, forming
RAD51 foci, and mediating HR in the assay we performed, is
surprising. Although these domains are clearly not absolutely
required for these functions, their strong evolutionary conservation
suggests they are important and may be involved in processes such
as the fine tuning of DNA repair or in meiosis. Induction of
resistance to PARPi in the context of other HR deficiencies might
be a means of identifying similar functionally dispensible modules
in proteins.
It seems probable that tumors arise in carriers of mutations in
BRCA1 and BRCA2, at least in part, due to an inability to maintain
genome stability caused a by a defect in a specific DNA repair
pathway, HR. The synthetic lethal strategy that we have used
exploits this defect, which creates an enormous sensitivity to
PARPi. Ironically, resistance to PARPi may be fostered by the same
DNA repair defect. In the absence of functional BRCA2, pathways
such as single-strand annealing and nonhomologous end-joining
compensate and repair DSBs by aligning short regions of homology
flanking the DSB, deleting the intervening (19, 20). The nucleotide
sequences surrounding many of the BRCA2 deletions in the PIR
clones and in one of the platinum-resistant ovarian tumors
revealed short regions of sequence identity (11). Therefore, it
seems possible that these deletions arose as a consequence DNA
repair dysfunction caused by the BRCA2 mutation. This new
mechanism of drug resistance seems to operate under Darwin’s
principle of natural selection—very rare stochastic genetic events
allowing cells to escape from the selection that chemotherapy
imposes (Fig. 1). However, the added twist here is that the
stochastically occurring reversion mutations may be favored by the
underlying DNA repair defect. Therefore, it will be important to

study the nature and frequency of the reversion events and the
stage of the disease in which they occur. Next Generation
Sequencing technologies may allow this issue to be addressed.
We believe that the observations we and others have reported
(11, 17) may have important clinical ramifications. A key question
is, can other mutations in BRCA2 or BRCA1 be reverted in this way
and cause resistance to PARPi and to platinum salts? If this is the
case, it seems possible that individual mutations will not all revert
at the same frequency. For example, large deletions may not be
prone to this mechanism of resistance. Therefore, mutation site or
nature may be predictive of therapeutic response/time to relapse.
Another issue is when should these potentially potent therapeutic
approaches be used, given that mechanism based resistance can
occur? If as discussed above, these reversion events are indeed
stochastic, it means that resistance is statistically much more likely
to occur in advanced disease where the challenge is to kill a large
tumor mass compared with the adjuvant setting where many fewer
cells are present, which can provide the raw material for resistance
to develop. Finally, it is intriguing to speculate whether similar
mechanisms might underlie resistance to therapy in some sporadic
cancers.
