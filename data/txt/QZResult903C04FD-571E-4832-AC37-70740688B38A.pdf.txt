Quelling an innate response to dsRNA
Kristen M. Ogden and B. V. Venkataram Prasad
The interferon inducible oligoadenylate synthetase
(OAS)/RNase L pathway is an innate defense against
invading viral pathogens that is linked to cell survival
[reviewed in 1]. OAS family proteins are pattern
recognition receptors that recognize double-stranded
RNA (dsRNA), a pathogen-associated molecular pattern.
In the presence of dsRNA, which is produced during the
replication cycle of a broad array of viruses, cytoplasmic
OAS proteins become activated to synthesize 2′-5′-linked
oligoadenylates (2-5A) from ATP. The only clearly
established function for 2-5A is to activate latent RNase L,
which then cleaves single-stranded RNA on the 3′ sides of
UpAp and UpUp dinucleotides. This RNase L activity can
inhibit viral replication directly, by cleaving the genome of
single-stranded RNA viruses or the mRNA of any virus, or
indirectly, by impairing host machinery required for viral
replication through cleavage of cellular mRNA and rRNA.
Additionally, the RNA products of RNase L cleavage can
upregulate interferon expression, via signaling through
RIG-I-like receptors, and stimulate NLRP3 inflammasome
activation.
Mounting evidence underscores the importance
of the OAS/RNase L response in host defense against
viral infection. OAS and/or RNase L have been shown
to inhibit the replication of viruses with both RNA and
DNA genomes, including West Nile virus, chikungunya
virus, respiratory syncytial virus, dengue virus, hepatitis
C virus, and herpes simplex virus-1. Perhaps not
surprisingly, viruses from diverse families have evolved
a variety of mechanisms to antagonize the OAS/RNase
L pathway [1]. One such strategy, which is shared by
group A and B rotaviruses (dsRNA genome) and group
2a betacoronaviruses (ssRNA genome), is to encode a 2H
phosphodiesterase that directly cleaves 2-5A [2-3].
While the OAS/RNase L response helps protect cells
from viral infection, it also can inhibit cell proliferation
and induce apoptosis. Thus, this pathway is tightly
regulated, primarily through modulation of the potent
chemical messenger, 2-5A. Cellular proteins that degrade
2-5A and may act as negative regulators of the OAS/RNase
L pathway include A kinase anchor protein 7 (AKAP7),
phosphodiesterase 12 (PDE12), and ectonucleotide
pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase 1 (ENPP1). These
proteins, which differ in structure, protein family, and
subcellular localization, may function at distinct sites to
rapidly remove 2-5A and restore homeostasis following
OAS activation.

Recently published structures of a viral 2H
phosphodiesterase that cleaves 2-5A, the C-terminal
domain (CTD) of the group A rotavirus VP3 protein,
in the absence and presence of 2-5A [3-4] shed light
on the ligand-binding and catalytic mechanism of
these enzymes and on the likely evolutionary origins
of viral 2′,5′-phosphodiesterases. Both the rotavirus
VP3 CTD and cellular AKAP7 are members of the 2H
phosphoesterase superfamily that cluster phylogenetically
with one another and with the coronavirus ns2 protein
[5]. Purified VP3 CTD forms a seven-stranded, concave
β-sheet, at the base of which reside the two HφTφ catalytic
motifs (φ = hydrophoic) that typify 2H superfamily
phosphoesterases, and two flanking α-helical regions.
This structure is strikingly similar (RMSD 3.0Å) to that
of the AKAP7 central domain [6]. However, the viral 2H
phosphoesterase is more compact, lacking two α-helical
regions and two β-strands that are present in the cellular
enzyme. Several of the residues in the catalytic cleft that
contact 2-5A in the VP3 CTD/2-5A co-crystal structure
align with residues that AKAP7 uses to engage AMP and
that are conserved among other 2H phosphoesterases
known or predicted to cleave 2-5A [3,6]. Thus, these
viral and cellular 2′,5′-phosphodiesterases likely employ
a common mechanism of substrate recognition and
catalysis. These observations provide support for the
hypothesis that an ancestral virus usurped a cellular
2′,5′-phosphodiesterase, such as AKAP7, and streamlined
the enzyme to accommodate the compact viral genome.
The strong similarities between the rotavirus VP3 CTD
and AKAP7, in terms of structure and of substrate
recognition and catalytic mechanisms, suggest that
small-molecule therapeutics designed to target viral
2′,5′-phosphodiesterases will have to be evaluated
carefully for potential effects on cellular enzymes that
degrade 2-5A, including AKAP7.
A recent study examining HeLa cells lacking PDE12
and PDE12 inhibitors provides evidence that this enzyme
modulates cellular 2-5A levels and suggests a role in
cellular resistance to viral infection. HeLa cells lacking
PDE12 exhibited increased levels of 2-5A in response to
dsRNA [7]. Viral spread, but not early viral replication,
was delayed in these cells. Treatment of wild-type cells
with inhibitors that bind PDE12 modulated 2-5A levels,
activated RNase L, and conferred some level of resistance
to infection by encephalomyocarditis virus, human
rhinovirus, and respiratory syncytial virus in wild-type

HeLa cells. Co-crystallization of PDE12 with one of the
inhibitors revealed that it is bound in the putative 2-5A
binding site. These findings suggest that inhibitors of
PDE12 and perhaps of other enzymes that modulate 2-5A
in the cell may provide a new avenue for broad-spectrum
antiviral drug development. However, in light of the
antiproliferative and apoptotic potential of the OAS/RNase
L pathway, it will be important to monitor effects of such
inhibitory compounds on cell viability and to determine
whether they bind other cellular and viral 2-5A-cleaving
enzymes or RNase L.
