Abstract
The novel proteasome inhibitor NPI-0052 has been shown
to sensitize tumor cells to apoptosis by various chemotherapeutic drugs and tumor necrosis factor–related apoptosisinducing ligand (TRAIL), although the mechanisms involved
are not clear. We hypothesized that NPI-0052–mediated sensitization may result from NF-κB inhibition and downstream
modulation of the metastasis inducer Snail and the metastasis
suppressor/immunosurveillance cancer gene product Raf-1
kinase inhibitory protein (RKIP). Human prostate cancer cell
lines were used as models, as they express different levels of
these proteins. We show that NPI-0052 inhibits both NF-κB
and Snail and induces RKIP expression, thus resulting in cell
sensitization to CDDP and TRAIL. The direct role of NF-κB inhibition in sensitization was corroborated with the NF-κB inhibitor DHMEQ, which mimicked NPI-0052 in sensitization
and inhibition of Snail and induction of RKIP. The direct role
of Snail inhibition by NPI-0052 in sensitization was shown
with Snail small interfering RNA, which reversed resistance
and induced RKIP. Likewise, the direct role of RKIP induction
in sensitization was revealed by both overexpression of RKIP
(mimicking NPI-0052) and RKIP small interfering RNA that inhibited NPI-0052–mediated sensitization. These findings show
that NPI-0052 modifies the NF-κB-Snail-RKIP circuitry in tumor cells and results in downstream inhibition of antiapoptotic gene products and chemoimmunosensitization. The
findings also identified Snail and RKIP as targets for reversal
of resistance. [Cancer Res 2009;69(21):8376–85]

Introduction
A new class of regimens reported to regulate NF-κB, and, therefore, tumor cell resistance to therapy, are proteasome inhibitors.
Hence, proteasome inhibitors have been developed to target the
proteasome with the objective to induce cancer cell cytostasis
or cell death when used alone or in combination with other
cytotoxics (1). NPI-0052 (salinosporamide A) is a novel member

of the proteasome inhibitor family identified from the marine
actinomycete Salinispora tropica and is a nonpeptide inhibitor of
all the three enzymatic activities of the 20S proteasome (2). The
antitumor properties of NPI-0052 have been evaluated in a wide
range of nonclinical studies including in vitro and in vivo models
(3–9). NPI-0052 has shown good sensitizing effects to apoptotic
death in tumors resistant to chemotherapy and tumor necrosis
factor–related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL; refs. 5, 10).
The major biological effect of NPI-0052 in tumors is apoptosis
induction and osteoclastogenesis suppression (7, 11).
Yeung and colleagues first identified the suppressing effect of a
novel gene product, the Raf-1 kinase inhibitory protein (RKIP), on
the activation status of the Raf-1/MEK/ERK and NF-κB survival
pathways. RKIP belongs to the phosphatidylethanolamine-binding
protein family (12, 13). RKIP loss or depletion has been associated with metastatic disease in an increasing number of solid tumors. RKIP involvement in the reversal of tumor cell resistance
to drugs and TRAIL apoptosis has also been reported previously
(14–16). A recent study by Beach and colleagues (17) reported
that RKIP is under the regulation of the transcription repressor
Snail in prostate tumors. Snail is a member of the Snail superfamily of zinc-finger transcription factors with a pivotal role in
embryonic development and cell survival (18). Snail has been
identified as one of the key modulators for the initiation of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition during tumor cell metastasis
(17, 19–24). Snail is transcriptionally regulated, in part, by NFκB (25, 26) and by itself via binding to its own promoter and
repressing activity (27).
In this study, we hypothesized that one potential mechanism
by which NPI-0052 reverses tumor resistance to chemotherapeutic and immunotherapeutic stimuli is via inhibition of NF-κB and,
consequently, downregulation of Snail expression and upregulation of RKIP as well as downstream modification of various
antiapoptotic gene products. This hypothesis was tested using
human tumor cell lines with constitutively active NF-κB as
models and with different levels of RKIP and Snail expression.
The following questions have been addressed: (a) Does NPI0052 inhibit Snail transcription and expression? (b) Does NPI0052–induced Snail suppression correlate with NPI-0052–induced
RKIP expression? (c) Is NPI-0052–induced repression of Snail due,
in part, to NPI-0052–mediated inhibition of NF-κB activity and
whether a specific NF-κB inhibitor, DHMEQ, mimics NPI-0052–
induced repression of Snail and induction of RKIP? (d) Does
silencing of Snail or overexpression of RKIP have a direct role
in drug and/or TRAIL-mediated apoptosis? (e) Does NPI-0052–
mediated NF-κB and Snail suppression and RKIP induction
result in activation of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway via

inhibition of antiapoptotic gene products? The findings reported
herein confirm our hypothesis and reveal new insights into the
mechanism of tumor cell sensitization to apoptosis by the
proteasome inhibitor NPI-0052 and identify gene products as
potential therapeutic targets to reverse tumor resistance to conventional therapies.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines. The human prostatic adenocarcinoma cell lines DU-145 and
LNCaP were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. The
melanoma cell line M202 was kindly provided by Dr. Ali Jazirehi (University
of California). The stable Snail knockdown DU-145 cell line (DU-145 siSnail)
as well as the corresponding control (DU-145 siLuc) were generated as
described previously (17).
Reagents and plasmid constructs. NPI-0052, MG132, and bortezomib
were provided by Nereus Pharmaceuticals, Calbiochem, and Millennium
Pharmaceuticals, respectively. Recombinant human TRAIL and CDDP were
purchased from PeproTech and Sigma, respectively. DHMEQ was kindly
provided by Dr. Kazuo Umezawa (Keio University). Stock solutions and
working dilutions of DHMEQ, NPI-0052, MG132, and CDDP were prepared
in DMSO, whereas bortezomib and TRAIL were prepared in distilled H2O.
Annexin V and propidium iodide were purchased from BD Pharmingen.
The Bcl-2 inhibitor 2-methoxyantimycin A3 and the antibodies recognizing
human RKIP, Snail, β-actin, X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis, Bcl-xL, active
caspase-3, IκBα, and phosphorylated IκBα proteins as well as the small
interfering RNAs (siRNA) against RKIP and Snail were obtained from
sources described previously (10, 28).

The CMV-HA-RKIP expression vector and the reporter constructs
pNF-κB-Luc and pRKIP-Luc wild-type and pRKIP-Luc mutant (carrying
mutations in three of the five E-boxes) have been described previously
(14, 16, 17).
Transient transfections. NF-κB and RKIP promoter activities were determined by luciferase assays as described previously (10, 17). The effect of
Snail suppression on RKIP promoter activity was determined in DU-145
cells initially transfected with Snail siRNA for 48 h, as described below, followed by transient transfection with the pRKIP-Luc wild-type or pRKIP-Luc
mutant constructs for 24 h. RKIP overexpression in DU-145 cells was done
as described previously (16).
Application of siRNA. The silencing of RKIP and Snail expression using
siRNAs was done according to the manufacturer's instructions (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology; refs. 16, 28).
Determination of apoptosis. Apoptosis was determined by either
cleavage of procaspase-3 or Annexin V/propidium iodide staining according to the manufacturer's instructions (BD Pharmingen).
Quantitative real-time PCR analysis. Total RNA was extracted and
purified from 1 × 106 DU-145 cells treated with 50 nmol/L NPI-0052
or 10 μg/mL DHMEQ for different periods using Trizol reagent (Life
Technologies). Both RNA isolation and cDNA synthesis were done according to the manufacturers' instructions (for cDNA; Promega). Snail and
RKIP mRNAs were determined by quantitative real-time PCR using
gene-specific primers at a concentration of 300 nmol/L as described previously (10, 28). Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was used as a
normalizing control.
Western blot analysis. Analysis of the protein expression was done by
using Western blot analysis as described previously (10, 16, 28, 29). The
expression of β-actin was used as an internal control.

Measurement of mitochondrial membrane depolarization. The mitochondrial membrane potential was determined by using 3,3′-dihexyloxacarbocyanine (Molecular Probes) as described previously (29).
Isobologram analysis. This was done according to Berenbaum (30).
Statistical analyses. Significant differences were determined by the
Mann-Whitney U and Kruskal-Wallis H tests using the SPSS software.

Results
NPI-0052 sensitizes TRAIL- and CDDP-resistant prostate
carcinoma cells to TRAIL- and CDDP-mediated apoptosis.
The toxicity profile of NPI-0052 in DU-145, LNCaP, and M202
cells was done by the trypan blue dye exclusion assay. The
NPI-0052 concentration of 50 nmol/L was determined as the optimal subtoxic concentration and was used in the majority of
the subsequent experiments. Pretreatment of DU-145 and

M202 cells with NPI-0052 (5-50 nmol/L) for 6 h followed by
treatment with TRAIL (5 and 10 ng/mL) or CDDP (1-3 μg/mL
for DU-145 and 5-20 μg/mL for M202 cells) for up to 24 h resulted in significant potentiation of apoptosis and synergy was
achieved as determined by isobologram analysis. In contrast, single treatment of cells with NPI-0052 or CDDP or TRAIL did not
reveal any significant induction of apoptosis in both cell lines
(Fig. 1A and B). The apoptosis determined in DU-145 cells by
activation of procaspase-3 was corroborated by Annexin V/propidium iodide staining (data not shown). We have also performed
sensitization assays using two other proteasome inhibitors, bortezomib and MG132. Both of these inhibitors sensitized DU-145 cells
to TRAIL- and CDDP-mediated apoptosis. However, compared with
NPI-0052, higher concentrations (5- to 20-fold) were needed to
achieve the same level of apoptosis (Supplementary Fig. S1). These

Regulation of NF-κB-Snail-RKIP Circuitry by NPI-0052

NPI-0052 in terms of Snail inhibition and induction of RKIP transcription. Real-time PCR was done in cDNAs derived from DHMEQ (10 μg/mL)–treated cells for various

data show that the combination treatment with NPI-0052 and
TRAIL or CDDP results in the sensitization of resistant DU-145
and M202 cells to TRAIL- and CDDP-mediated apoptosis.
NPI-0052 inhibits the transcription factors NF-κB and
Snail and upregulates the metastasis suppressor gene products, RKIP. Increasing concentrations of NPI-0052 significantly
inhibited NF-κB promoter activity in DU-145 cells as shown in
Fig. 2A. DHMEQ was used as an internal positive control. Cell
treatment with NPI-0052 also resulted in significant increase of
phosphorylated IκBα levels (up to 7-fold at 12 h) due to lack
of degradation by the proteasome (Fig. 2B). These findings
confirm the suppressive effect of NPI-0052 on NF-κB activity in
DU-145 cells.
Because Snail is partially under the positive regulation of NF-κB
(25) and Snail acts as transcriptional suppressor of RKIP (17),
we anticipated that NPI-0052–mediated inhibition of NF-κB will
affect both Snail and RKIP expression profiles in an inverse relationship. As shown in Fig. 2C and D, the baseline RKIP and
Snail mRNA and protein levels in DU-145 cells were inversely
correlated, with Snail expression to be dominant over RKIP, as
expected, according to the high metastatic potential of this cell
line. In contrast, Snail mRNA levels in cells treated with 50
nmol/L NPI-0052 for increasing incubation periods were significantly reduced beginning at 0.5 h posttreatment and lasting for

www.aacrjournals.org

8 h (Fig. 2C). Concomitantly, Snail protein levels were found significantly reduced at ≥4 h posttreatment with NPI-0052 (Fig. 2D). Contrarily, RKIP mRNA expression showed a constant increase starting
at 0.5 h posttreatment up to the final time point of 18 h (Fig. 2C).
Similarly, RKIP protein levels (Fig. 2D) followed a time-dependent
significant increase in the presence of NPI-0052. Preliminary data
also show that other proteasome inhibitors such as bortezomib
and MG132 have comparable effects on RKIP and Snail expression
(data not shown). These results show that NPI-0052–mediated NFκB suppression correlated with inhibition of Snail and the induction of RKIP expression.
Direct role of NPI-0052–induced NF-κB inhibition in tumor
cell sensitization to CDDP- and TRAIL-mediated apoptosis.
The direct role of NPI-0052–mediated NF-κB inhibition in the
regulation of Snail/RKIP crosstalk and induction of apoptosis
was examined in DU-145 cells treated with the NF-κB inhibitor
DHMEQ (31). DHMEQ treatment resulted in a time-dependent
inhibition of Snail mRNA expression and induction of RKIP transcript levels (Fig. 3A). Concomitantly, DHMEQ had suppressive
effects on Snail and Bcl-xL protein levels, whereas it induced
RKIP protein expression (Fig. 3B). In addition, as shown in the
representative flow charts in Fig. 3C, DHMEQ had a significant
potentiating effect on apoptosis induction in combination with
CDDP or TRAIL and the apoptotic levels achieved were in

the same range as those obtained by NPI-0052 (Fig. 1A). These
findings suggest that NPI-0052 mimics DHMEQ and facilitates
tumor cell sensitization to CDDP- and TRAIL-mediated apoptosis
through suppression of NF-κB and its antiapoptotic targets such
as Bcl-xL.
Direct role of NPI-0052–induced RKIP upregulation in
tumor cell sensitization to CDDP- and TRAIL-mediated
apoptosis. The direct effect of RKIP induction by NPI-0052 in
the regulation of tumor cell sensitivity to both CDDP- and
TRAIL-apoptosis was examined by ectopic expression of RKIP
in DU-145 cells. Cells overexpressing RKIP were more sensitive
to induction of apoptosis after addition of CDDP or TRAIL
compared with untransfected cells (Fig. 4A) and the percentage
of apoptosis was similar to that achieved by NPI-0052 in Fig. 1A.
Overexpression of RKIP was also associated with downregulation
of Bcl-xL (Fig. 4A). Cells transfected with the control CMV empty
vector did not show any significant differences in either potentia-

tion of apoptosis or Snail or Bcl-xL expression compared with
untransfected cells.
To further confirm that the observed sensitization of tumor
cells to TRAIL- or CDDP-mediated apoptosis by NPI-0052 was
the consequence of NPI-0052–induced RKIP overexpression,
we examined whether the inhibition of RKIP expression
could reverse the sensitization. The nonmetastatic prostate
tumor LNCaP cells express higher RKIP levels than DU-145.
LNCaP showed a significant RKIP upregulation starting as early
as 4 h posttreatment with NPI-0052 (Fig. 4B). LNCaP cells were
first transfected with RKIP siRNA for 24 h followed by treatment
with NPI-0052 for 6 h and TRAIL or CDDP treatment for an additional 18 h. Apoptosis was determined at 48 h posttransfection.
The combination of NPI-0052 with CDDP or TRAIL sensitized
the cells to apoptosis, whereas RKIP siRNA treatment significantly
reversed this sensitization (Fig. 4C). Cells transfected with control
siRNA retained their sensitization pattern, indicating that RKIP has

a specific biological role in TRAIL- and CDDP-mediated apoptosis.
Moreover, RKIP silencing resulted in augmentation of Snail expression most likely via preventing NF-κB inhibition (13). The above
findings show that RKIP is one of the gene products through which
NPI-0052 regulates tumor cell sensitivity to CDDP- or TRAIL-mediated apoptosis.
Direct role of NPI-0052–induced inhibition of Snail in
tumor cell sensitization to TRAIL- and CDDP-mediated
apoptosis. The direct involvement of NPI-0052–mediated Snail
inhibition in tumor cell sensitization to apoptosis was examined
in DU-145 cells (high basal levels of Snail) transfected with Snail
siRNA. Snail silencing mimics NPI-0052 with respect to RKIP
induction as determined by Western blot analysis (Fig. 5A) and
sensitized cells to apoptosis after cell treatment with CDDP or
TRAIL. The above findings were corroborated by stable Snail
knockdown DU-145 cells treated with CDDP in presence or
absence of further treatment with RKIP siRNA. Control DU-145
wild-type and siLuc-transfected DU-145 cells did not show
any significant apoptotic response to CDDP with or without
treatment with RKIP siRNA. In contrast, Snail-depleting cells
responded significantly to apoptosis following CDDP treatment.

www.aacrjournals.org

However, transfection with RKIP siRNA abolished the apoptotic
effect of CDDP on those cells (Fig. 5B). Protein analysis also revealed
that Snail knockdown DU-145 cells have much higher RKIP levels
compared with siLuc and wild-type DU-145 cells (Fig. 5B).
The derived RKIP induction and apoptosis by Snail siRNA were
also corroborated by cotransfecting DU-145 cells with Snail siRNA
and the RKIP full promoter constructs with wild-type E-boxes
(pRKIP-Luc wild-type) or carrying mutations in three of the five
E-boxes present in the full promoter sequence (pRKIP-Luc
mutant). Figure 5C shows that the pRKIP-Luc wild-type promoter
activity is significantly lower in DU-145 cells when compared with
the pRKIP-Luc mutant activity, indicating that the lack of the three
functional E-boxes in the mutated construct could be responsible
for promoter activation (17). In contrast, silencing of Snail by Snail
siRNA gives a significant boost in wild-type RKIP promoter activation without affecting significantly the activity of the mutated promoter. Cells transfected with the relative control siRNA gave the
same trend of response as untransfected cells. These findings
strongly suggest that Snail inhibition and derepression of RKIP
transcription and expression by NPI-0052 are involved in the
reversal of tumor cell resistance.

Role of NPI-0052–induced mitochondrial membrane
potential depolarization and inhibition of antiapoptotic
gene products (Bcl-2 family) in tumor cell sensitization
to apoptosis. We further examined the effect of NPI-0052
treatment on the regulation of the different apoptotic pathways.
DU-145 cells were either treated with NPI-0052 (50 nmol/L) or
CDDP (3 μg/mL) or TRAIL (5 ng/mL) as single agents or the
combinations and the mitochondrial membrane potential as well
as the expression of different caspases and antiapoptotic gene products were assessed. As shown in Fig. 6A, cells exhibited increased
mitochondrial membrane depolarization in both combined treatments and in single treatments with NPI-0052. In contrast, only the

combination and not the single treatment activated significantly
the caspase-8. NPI-0052 induced also some cleavage of caspase-9;
however, the combination treatment resulted in a more significant
cleavage of caspase-9. Both Bcl-xL and X-linked inhibitor of
apoptosis expressions were inhibited by NPI-0052, whereas
neither CDDP nor TRAIL had any effect (Fig. 6B). These findings
suggest that NPI-0052–induced tumor cell sensitization to TRAILor CDDP-mediated apoptosis promotes the activation of type II
apoptotic pathways.
Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL have been reported, by us and others, as
dominant factors responsible for the acquired resistance of certain
tumor cells to chemotherapy and immunotherapy including TRAIL

induces high levels of Snail and antiapoptotic gene products and represses RKIP expression, thus conferring to tumor chemoimmunoresistance. NPI-0052 regulates cell
survival and apoptosis via inhibition of phosphorylated IκBα degradation and consequently NF-κB inactivation. NPI-0052–mediated NF-κB inhibition leads to the
induction of RKIP through downregulation of its transcriptional repressor Snail. NPI-0052–induced RKIP upregulation potentiates further NF-κB inhibition and
suppression of NF-κB-regulated antiapoptotic gene targets, thus leading to tumor chemoimmunosensitization.

Regulation of NF-κB-Snail-RKIP Circuitry by NPI-0052

(15, 29, 32, 33). Thus, because Bcl-xL is inhibited by NPI-0052
(Fig. 6B) and directly by RKIP overexpression (Fig. 4A) or by
DHMEQ (Fig. 3A) and all of such treatments sensitize the cells
to apoptosis, we hypothesized that the direct inhibition of Bcl-2
family members will mimic NPI-0052 and RKIP for tumor cell
sensitization. Indeed, treatment of DU-145 cells with the family
inhibitor 2-methoxyantimycin A3 mimicked NPI-0052 and resulted
in significant cell sensitivity to TRAIL- and CDDP-mediated
apoptosis as shown in Fig. 6C.

Discussion
This study establishes for the first time the NF-κB-Snail-RKIP
circuitry as a crucial regulator of tumor cell response to apoptotic
stimuli and introduces this loop as a novel target for therapeutic
intervention. One such therapeutic agent studied herein is the proteasome inhibitor NPI-0052. Our findings show that the inhibition
of Snail and the induction of RKIP are pivotal factors in the
NPI-0052–mediated reversal of tumor cell resistance to both
CDDP- and TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Both Snail inhibition
and RKIP induction triggered by NPI-0052 were a consequence
of NF-κB inhibition and, consequently, led to the inhibition of
antiapoptotic gene products and sensitizing the tumor cells to
apoptosis.
Although proteasome inhibitors such as bortezomib, carfilzomib, and NPI-0052 exert broad effects on cancer cells, including
sensitization of resistant clones to apoptotic stimuli (4, 34–37),
the underlying mechanisms of sensitization are not totally clear.
NPI-0052 as a single agent has shown advantages compared with
conventional proteasome inhibitors such as bortezomib and
MG132 with regards to a more rapid onset and longer duration
of action, wider spectrum of inhibitory effects of the 20S proteasome, greater suppressive effect on NF-κB activation in many
tumor cell models, potent apoptotic activity at low concentrations,
and ability to reverse tumor resistance to bortezomib in vitro and
in vivo (4, 6, 38). In preclinical studies, NPI-0052 was also able to
reverse tumor resistance to chemotherapy and TRAIL apoptosis by
inhibiting NF-κB (10, 39). This study investigated the underlying
mechanism by which NPI-0052 reverses tumor cell resistance to
both TRAIL and CDDP.
The direct role of NPI-0052–induced inhibition of NF-κB activity in the reversal of prostate tumor cell resistance to TRAIL- and
CDDP-mediated apoptosis was tested with the use of a specific
NF-κB inhibitor, DHMEQ, which inhibits the translocation of
active NF-κB from the cytoplasm to the nucleus (31). NPI-0052
mimicked DHMEQ in terms of cell sensitization to CDDP and
TRAIL apoptosis through suppression of antiapoptotic proteins
such as Bcl-xL (40). The constitutive hyperactivation of NF-κB
has been widely investigated as a crucial factor in tumor
chemoresistance and immunoresistance in several basic and clinical studies (41–43). Direct inhibition of NF-κB by pharmacologic
inhibitors or inhibition of pathways that regulate NF-κB have
provided significant chemosensitizing effects in vivo and in vitro
in various tumor models mainly through inhibition of prosurvival
signals (44–46).
Part of the NF-κB antiapoptotic network was recently reported to
be the metastasis inducer transcription factor Snail. NF-κB has
been identified as a putative transcription activator of Snail through
binding to a region between −194 and −78 bp in the human
Snail promoter (25). Our findings show that inhibition of NF-κB
by DHMEQ in tumor cells resulted in Snail suppression, whereas

www.aacrjournals.org

treatment with NPI-0052 mimicked DHMEQ and led to Snail downregulation at the mRNA and protein levels. In addition, cell treatment with Snail siRNA sensitized DU-145 cells to CDDP and TRAIL
apoptosis, concomitantly with the decrease of Bcl-xL expression,
suggesting the direct role of Snail inhibition in NPI-0052–mediated
reversal of tumor resistance to apoptosis.
Although Snail has been well established as a key element in the
induction of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition during tumor
metastasis, its involvement in tumor resistance to apoptosis is less
studied. Snail has been reported to regulate components of the early to late G1 transition and the G1-S checkpoint and to promote cell
survival after genotoxic stress in breast, lung, and pancreatic
adenocarcinomas via regulation of several gene products and
pathways (47–52). In all cases, depletion of endogenous Snail by
RNA interference led to increased sensitivity to DNA damage
accompanied by increased expression of the proapoptotic factors
identified as targets of Snail. However, the molecular basis of the
protective prosurvival function of Snail superfamily members
was found to diverge dramatically among different biological
contexts, suggesting that there are tissue-specific regulatory
mechanisms (49). The above observations are in agreement with
our present findings, supporting the inhibition of Snail by
NPI-0052 in the reversal of resistance to both CDDP- and TRAILinduced apoptosis.
As mentioned above, an additional target of Snail is the metastasis
suppressor gene product RKIP shown previously to play a role in
tumor cell sensitivity to apoptotic stimuli (14, 16, 46). Beach and colleagues (17) have reported that ectopic expression of Snail in the
nonmetastatic cancer cell line, LNCaP, significantly decreased RKIP
expression, whereas chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis confirmed the suppressive effect of Snail on the RKIP promoter activity.
These data are corroborated by our findings here that RKIP levels
were increased in DU-145 when the expression of Snail was knocked
down either by Snail-specific siRNA, NPI-0052 or DHMEQ. Concomitantly, cell treatment with Snail siRNA resulted in upregulation of
the wild-type pRKIP-Luc activity, but there was no enhancement of
the mutated pRKIP-Luc activity above the baseline as expected.
RKIP overexpression mimicked Snail siRNA or NPI-0052 treatment
in the sensitization of tumor cells to CDDP- and TRAIL-mediated
apoptosis and in the decrease of Bcl-xL levels. These effects were
reversed by the use of RKIP siRNA, thus confirming the direct role
of RKIP expression in the regulation of cell sensitivity to apoptotic
stimuli. The present findings are in agreement with previous reports
by Chatterjee and colleagues (14) and by us (16), which have shown
the reversal of prostate tumor cell resistance to drug- and TRAILmediated apoptosis by RKIP overexpression, respectively.
The inhibition of caspase-8 and -9 as well as X-linked inhibitor
of apoptosis and Bcl-xL after single or combined treatment with
NPI-0052 reveals the involvement of type II apoptotic pathways in
NPI-0052–induced apoptotic death. The mitochondrial type II
pathway appears to be dominant, because the modified expression of the antiapoptotic gene product Bcl-xL has been shown
to regulate resistance (53). The findings show that the Bcl-2 family inhibitor 2-methoxyantimycin A3 mimicked NPI-0052 in the
cell sensitization to CDPP and TRAIL apoptosis. Thus, the direct
suppressive effect of RKIP overexpression or Snail siRNA or
DHMEQ on Bcl-xL expression supports the involvement of Bcl-xL
inhibition as part of the mechanism of NPI-0052–mediated reversal
of resistance.
Collectively, our findings established that the NF-κB-SnailRKIP circuitry in tumor cells regulates tumor cell resistance to

apoptotic stimuli. The interregulatory activities of each of the
components of this circuitry are schematically depicted in
Fig. 6D. We show that NPI-0052 inhibits NF-κB and Snail and induces RKIP and each of these gene products regulates tumor cell
resistance. Overall, the NF-κB-Snail-RKIP feedback loop is established in cancer cells with a dominant net effect in cell survival,
resistance, and metastasis and each of its components separately
(43, 54–56), and combined, has also an important role in prognosis.
Based on the poor toxicity of NPI-0052 on normal cells (peripheral
blood mononuclear cells and normal bone marrow; refs. 3, 4), the
present findings establish the NPI-0052–mediated dysfunction of
the NF-κB-Snail-RKIP circuitry and propose its potential therapeutic application in the reversal of tumor cell resistance to conventional antitumor regimens.
