BACKGROUND: Bortezomib demonstrated promising activity in lymphomas. The authors conducted a
randomized phase 2 trial of frontline rituximab plus cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (R-CHOP) with the addition of bortezomib in patients with B-cell lymphoma. METHODS: Patients
were randomized between 2 schedules of bortezomib, Arm A (Days 1, 4, 8, and 11) and Arm B (Days 1 and
8), combined with 6 cycles of R-CHOP. For the first patients (Step 1), bortezomib was given at a dose of
1 mg/m2 in Arm A and 1.3 mg/m2 in Arm B. For the next patients (Step 2), doses were increased to 1.3 mg/
m2 and 1.6 mg/m2 in Arms A and B, respectively. The primary endpoint was the rate of complete response
(CR) and unconfirmed CR (CR/CRu) after 6 cycles. RESULTS: Forty-nine patients were included in the
study, and 41 patients (84%) achieved a CR/CRu, ie, 18 of 20 patients (90%) in Arm A and 23 of 29 patients
(79%) in Arm B. There were 6 partial responses and 2 patients with progressive disease. Neurologic toxicity
occurred in 21 patients (43%) and was grade 2 in 11 patients (7 patients in Step 2) and grade 3 in 10
patients (9 patients in Step 2). Other grade 3 and 4 toxicities included constipation (n ¼ 1), infections (n ¼
3), and cardiac events (n ¼ 2). Grade 3 and 4 thrombocytopenia and leucopenia occurred in 14% and 41%
of cycles, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: R-CHOP þ bortezomib was an effective regimen and produced an
84% CR rate. However, the dose-limiting neurotoxicity should be kept in mind for further trials with vinca

KEY WORDS: B-cell lymphoma, bortezomid, rituximab, chemotherapy, phase 2 trial.

The rituximab plus cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin,
vincristine and prednisone (R-CHOP) regimen is standard for most patients who have B-cell malignancies that
are positive for CD20 (a nonglycosylated phosphoprotein
that is expressed on the surface of all mature B-cells).
However, in patients who have diffuse large cell lymphomas, progress is needed, because the complete response
rate is usually <75%.1 In addition, in low-grade lymphomas, although patients respond well to chemotherapy, the
complete response (CR) rate averages only 50%, and there
is a continuous pattern of recurrence.2,3 These data suggest that there is a need to improve this combination therapy with new innovative agents. Bortezomib is the first
member of the new class of anticancer agents called proteasome inhibitors to be studied in human clinical trials.
Proteasome inhibitors can act through multiple mechanisms to arrest tumor growth, tumor spread, and angiogenesis, and they also direct the induction of apoptosis. In
vitro studies have demonstrated a synergistic effect of the
combination of bortezomib with doxorubicin.4 Phase 1
and 2 clinical studies demonstrated that bortezomib is a
well tolerated agent when used alone with minimal hematologic toxicity. When it was used as a single agent administered twice weekly for 2 weeks at a dose of 1.5 mg/m2
followed by a 1-week rest period, bortezomid exhibited
activity in 2 phase 2 studies in patients with indolent lymphomas with overall response rates of 41% and 58%.5,6
Before running a randomized phase 3 study, it is important to evaluate the efficacy of bortezomib combined
with a well established regimen such as the R-CHOP in
phase 2 trials. The objective of the current randomized
phase 2 study was to evaluate the response rate and toxicity of the R-CHOP regimen combined with 2 schedules
of administration of bortezomib in patients with CD20positive B-cell lymphoma.

unconfirmed CR (CRu) rate after the end of treatment
(CR/CRu rate). Calculation of the sample size was based
on the primary CR/CRu endpoint. We anticipated a CR
rate of 75% and computed that, by using a triangular test
procedure for every 3 consecutive patients, an average
sample size of 48 patients would provide 80% power at
the overall 5% (2-sided) significance level to detect a CR
rate >55% (null hypothesis, 55%; alternative hypothesis,
75%).7 The secondary endpoints were toxicity, overall
survival (OS), and event-free survival (EFS).
The protocol was approved by the local ethics committees and the national regulatory agency according to
French regulatory laws. The study was posted on the US
National Institutes of Health National Clinical Trials
(NCT) website (NCT00169468).
Patient Selection
Patients with 1 of the following CD20-positive B-cell
lymphomas were enrolled in this study: marginal zone
lymphoma, lymphocytic lymphoma, follicular lymphoma
requiring treatment (including histologic transformation), mantle cell lymphoma, and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (but without adverse prognostic factors defined by
the International Prognostic Index [IPI]). Patients were
required to be between ages 18 years and 80 years and had
to have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (PS) <3. Exclusion criteria were other
types of lymphoma (Burkitt lymphoma, CD20-negative
B-cell lymphomas, T-cell lymphomas) and central nervous system involvement. Pathologic review of the biopsy
material was performed after inclusion by a panel of
expert pathologists.

Patients received the CHOP regimen, ie, a combination
of cyclophosphamide 750 mg/m2, doxorubicin 50 mg/m2,
and vincristine 1.4 mg/m2 (up to 2 mg) all on Day 1, and
prednisone 40 mg/m2 daily for 5 days administered every
3 weeks (1 cycle). Rituximab was given at a dose of
4541

Original Article

375 mg/m2 on Day 1 of each CHOP cycle. Patients had
to receive 6 cycles of R-CHOP with granulocyte–colonystimulating factor support.
Patients were randomized between 2 schedules
(Arm A and Arm B) of bortezomib administration. Bortezomib was administered as a biweekly schedule on Days
1, 4, 8, and 11 of R-CHOP in Arm A and as a weekly
schedule on Days 1 and 8 in Arm B. For the first patients
(Step 1), bortezomib was delivered at doses of 1 mg/m2
(total dose per cycle, 4 mg/m2) and 1.3 mg/m2 (total dose
per cycle, 2.6 mg/m2) in Arms A and B, respectively. After
mid-inclusion (Step 2; ie, in the absence of severe toxicity
after the end of treatment in Patients 1 through 24), it was
planned to escalate the bortezomib dose up to 1.3 mg/m2
in Arm A and up to 1.6 mg/m2 in Arm B.
In case of hematologic toxicity, bortezomib was
withheld for up to 2 weeks until the patient had a hemoglobin value 7.5 g/dL, an absolute neutrophil count
0.75  109/L, and a platelet count 50  109/L. If the
toxicity did not resolve, then the study drug was discontinued. If the toxicity resolved, then bortezomib was
restarted at the same dose level if 1 dose was held or at
reduced doses if 2 doses were held (either in consecutive
cycles or twice in 1 cycle). If the patient received 1.3 mg/m2,
1.5 mg/m2, or 1.6 mg/m2, then the dose was reduced to
1.0 mg/m2. If the patient received 1.0 mg/m2, then the
dose was reduced to 0.7 mg/m2. If the patient received
0.7 mg/m2, then bortezomib was stopped.
Patients who experienced grade 2 bortezomibrelated neuropathic pain and/or peripheral sensory neuropathy had a 25% dose reduction for the next injection.
Bortezomib was stopped when grade 3 or greater peripheral sensory neuropathy was observed. Treatment was
withheld for up to 2 weeks with grade 3 or worse other
nonhematologic toxicities until they resolved to grade 1 or
lower.

Staging and Follow-Up
Initial staging included a computerized tomodensitometry scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvic areas and a
bone marrow biopsy. During treatment, patients were
observed before each study drug dose. They were evaluated for possible toxicities that may have occurred after
the previous doses. Toxicities were assessed according to
4542

the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology
Criteria for Adverse Events (version 3.0).
Disease evaluation for response assessments were those
recommended in the International Workshop criteria.8
Patients who completed their treatment had a complete
clinical examination every 3 months for the first year and
then every 6 months for 5 years. A computed tomography
scan was obtained twice a year. No routine molecular biology procedures or dynamic imaging methods were used.

Statistical Analysis
Patients were analyzed in an intent-to-treat basis. EFS was
defined as the time between randomization and primary
treatment failure, recurrence, and either death from any
cause or last follow-up. OS was defined as the time between
randomization and either last follow-up or death from any
cause. Estimates of survival were calculated according to
the Kaplan-Meier method. All statistical analyses were performed using Statistical Application System software (SAS,
version 9.13; SAS Institute, Cary, NC).

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
Between January 2005 and April 2006, 49 patients were
randomized from 4 participating French centers. In January 2006, according to the triangular-test sequential analysis and dose-limiting toxicity, Arm A was closed at 20
patients, and inclusion continued only in Arm B. Then,
in total, 20 patients were assigned to Arm A (13 were
treated at Step 1, and 7 were treated at Step 2), and 29
patients were assigned to Arm B (14 were treated at Step 1,
and 15 were treated at Step 2).
Patient characteristics at study entry are detailed in
Table 1. The median age was 63 years (range, 32-76
years), and 28 patients (57%) were men. PS was altered in
4 patients (8%), 33 patients (67%) had stage IV lymphoma, lactate dehydrogenase serum levels were elevated
in 16 patients (33%), and the IPI was >1 in 18 patients
(37%). A central review indicated that the pathologic subtypes of lymphoma included were lymphoplasmacytic
lymphoma (3 patients), small lymphocyte lymphoma (8
patients), marginal zone lymphoma (8 patients), follicular
lymphoma (11 patients), mantle cell lymphoma (3

Treatment Delivery
Two hundred ninety cycles of R-CHOP and 819 injections of bortezomib were administered to the 49 patients.
Forty-six of 49 patients received the 6 planned cycles of
R-CHOP chemotherapy. The other 3 patients received 4,

Toxic Effects
All patients were assessable for toxic effects. No deaths
were observed on the study. The most common drugrelated, nonhematologic toxicities observed on Arm A
(biweekly schedule) were neurologic toxicity (70% of
patients), queasiness (40%), stomatitis (35%), infection
(30%), constipation (10%), and cardiovascular toxicity
(5%). The most common drug-related, nonhematologic
toxicities observed on Arm B (weekly schedule) were neurologic toxicity (71% of patients), infection (37%), stomatitis (28%), queasiness (28%), constipation (10%),
and cardiovascular toxicity (3%). Grade 3 nonhematologic toxicities are detailed in Table 2. There was no grade
4 nonhematologic toxicity.
For both arms, the frequency and severity of neurologic toxicity was greater in Step 2 with the highest dose of

11 patients (22%), including 1 of 13 patients in Arm A,
Step 1; 3 of 14 patients in Arm B, Step 1; and 7 of 15
patients (47%) in Arm B, Step 2. In addition, grade 3
neurologic toxicity (10 patients; 20%) also was more frequent during Step 2 and occurred in 1 of 14 patients in
Arm B, Step 1; in 5 of 7 patients (71%) in Arm A, Step 2;
and in 4 of 15 patients (27%) in Arm B, Step 2.
Grade 3 and 4 leucopenia was observed in 41% of

thrombocytopenia occurred in 14% of cycles and only
among patients in Arm A (35% of cycles; ie, 27% in Step
1 and 44% in Step 2).

Patient Outcome
All patients were evaluated for tumor response after 6
cycles of R-CHOP þ bortezomib. Forty-one patients
achieved a CR/CRu, 6 patients achieved a partial response
(PR), and 2 patients progressed on therapy. In Arm A, 18
of 20 patients (90%) achieved a CR/CRu (9 CRs, 9
CRus); and, in Arm B, 23 of 29 patients (79%) patients
achieved a CR/CRu (15 CRs, 8 CRus). In Arm A, 2 of 20
patients (10%) achieved a PR; and, in Arm B, 4 of 29
patients (14%) achieved a PR. Two patients progressed
on therapy in Arm B. According to the triangular test

rate reached 79% (P ¼ .31).
The CR/CRu rate was 73% in small cell lymphomas
(14 of 19 patients, including marginal zone, small lymphocytic, and lymphoplasmacytic lymphomas), 82% in follicular lymphomas (9 of 11 patients), and 100% in mantle cell
lymphomas (3 of 3 patients). All together, the CR/CRu
rate was 79% in 33 patients with indolent lymphoma and
88% in patients with aggressive lymphomas (14 of 16
patients, including those with transformed follicular lymphomas and diffuse large B-cell lymphomas; P ¼ .46).
The median follow-up was 2 years (range, 13-27

DISCUSSION
The current trial demonstrated that the combination of
R-CHOP plus bortezomib was able to produce a >75%

The 2 treatment arms cannot be compared statistically;
however, the biweekly schedule seems to lead to better
results than the weekly schedule (CR/CRu rate, 90% vs
79%, respectively).
Bortezomib demonstrated activity in different lymphoma subtypes and received regular approval for the treatment of patients with recurrent mantle cell lymphoma after
previous therapy.9 A few early phase 2 studies have been
reported in patients with recurrent or refractory lymphoma
subtypes other than B-cell lymphoma subtypes,.5,6,10 Very
limited experience has been reported with bortezomib combined with chemotherapy in patients with lymphoma. In a
phase 1 study reported by Orlowski et al,11 patients
received bortezomib on Days 1, 4, 8, and 11 of a 3-week
cycle at doses ranging from 0.90 mg/m2 to 1.5 mg/m2
along with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin on Day 4 at
30 mg/m2. Six of their patients had lymphoma, and 2 PRs
were observed (1 in a patient with mycosis fungoides and 1
in a patient with peripheral T-cell lymphoma).
Recently, Leonard et al also presented a phase 1/2
trial of dose-escalated bortezomib with standard RCHOP in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.12
Patients received the same R-CHOP combination as that
used in the current study, but bortezomib was given at a
dose of 0.7 mg/m2, 1.0 mg/m2, or 1.3 mg/m2 on Days 1
and 4 of each cycle. Thirty-six patients in that study were
evaluable: The objective response rate was 100%, and the
CR/CRu rate was 75% CR/CRu. The 2-year progression4545

free survival was estimated at 72%. Peripheral neuropathy
occurred in 22 patients (55%) and was grade 1 in 45% of
patients, grade 2 in 5% of patients, and grade 3 in 5% of
patients.
In the current study, neurologic toxicity was more
frequent and severe, particularly on the biweekly schedule,
and 5 episodes of grade 3 neuropathy were reported in 7
patients (71%) who received bortezomib 1.3 mg/m2. The
21 episodes of sensitive neurologic toxicity were observed
after 3 or 4 cycles of full-dose therapy and resolved within
6 months in most patients. However, 3 patients remained
symptomatic and still needed analgesics 12 months after
the end of therapy. This observation raises the question of
which dose of bortezomib produces the maximum activity
in combination with standard R-CHOP. The current
results suggest that, for future trials, the biweekly schedule
should be used only at 1 mg/m2. In addition, this recommendation is in line with the preliminary report by Kahl
et al, who identified a maximum tolerated dose of 1 mg/
m2 for vincristine and 1.3 mg/m2 for bortezomid.13
In conclusion, our results indicate that the combination of bortezomib plus R-CHOP is encouraging and
may warrant further studies. Toxicity was acceptable
when low doses of bortezomib were used, but neurologic
toxicity was excessively high when bortezomib was given
at doses that were explored in monotherapy during phase
2 trials in lymphomas.
