Abstract

Author Manuscript

The naked mole rat (NMR, Heterocephalus glaber) is a strictly subterranean, extraordinarily longlived eusocial mammal1. Although the size of a mouse, its maximum lifespan exceeds 30 years
and makes this animal the longest living rodent. NMRs show negligible senescence, no age-related
increase in mortality, and high fecundity until death2. In addition to delayed aging, NMRs are
resistant to both spontaneous cancer and experimentally induced tumorigenesis3,4. NMRs pose a
challenge to the theories that link aging, cancer and redox homeostasis. Although characterized by
significant oxidative stress5, the NMR proteome does not show age-related susceptibility to
oxidative damage nor increased ubiquitination6. NMRs naturally reside in large colonies with a
single breeding female, the “queen,” who suppresses the sexual maturity of her subordinates11.
NMRs also live in full darkness, at low oxygen and high carbon dioxide concentrations7, and are
unable to sustain thermogenesis8 nor feel certain types of pain9,10. Here we report sequencing and
analysis of the NMR genome, which revealed unique genome features and molecular adaptations
consistent with cancer resistance, poikilothermy, hairlessness, altered visual function, circadian
rhythms and taste sensing, and insensitivity to low oxygen. This information provides insights into
NMR’s exceptional longevity and capabilities to live in hostile conditions, in the dark and at low
oxygen. The extreme traits of NMR, together with the reported genome and transcriptome
information, offer unprecedented opportunities for understanding aging and advancing many other
areas of biological and biomedical research.

We applied a whole genome shotgun strategy to sequence the genome of an individual male
NMR (Table 1 and Supplementary Tables 1-3). The sequencing depth of 98.6% of the
genome assembly was higher than 20X (Supplementary Fig. 1-4). The mitochondrial
genome was also assembled. Approximately 25% of the NMR genome was represented by
transposon-derived repeats, which is lower than in other mammals (40% in human, 37% in
mouse, and 35% in rat genomes) (Supplementary Tables 4 and 5, Supplementary Fig. 5-7).
The predicted NMR gene set included 22,561 genes (Table 1 and Supplementary Table 6),
which is comparable to other mammals (e.g., 22,389 in human, 23,317 in mouse, and 22,841
in rat). Among these, 21,394 (94.8%) genes were transcribed (based on the RNA-seq data
for 7 organs). More than 98% of NMR genes could be functionally annotated through
homology approaches (Supplementary Table 7), and the quality of predicted genes was
comparable to that of well-annotated mammalian genomes (Supplementary Tables 6 and 8
and Supplementary Fig. 8).

Author Manuscript

Most of the NMR genome (93%) showed synteny to human, mouse, or rat genomes
(Supplementary Table 9), and pairwise comparisons suggested a relatively low rate of NMR
genome rearrangements after the split from the murid common ancestor. We defined
common synteny blocks in human, mouse, rat and NMR genomes and identified segmental
duplications and lineage-specific indels (Supplementary Tables 10 and 11 and
Supplementary Fig. 9). By analyzing single-copy orthologous groups, we constructed a
phylogenetic tree involving NMR and other mammals (Fig. 1). As expected, NMR placed
within rodents and its ancestor split from the ancestor of rats and mice approximately 73
million years ago, whereas the ancestor of NMR, mouse and rat split from rabbit

approximately 86 million years ago. Thus, in spite of some exceptional traits of NMR, the
overall properties of its genome appeared to be similar to those of other mammals.

Lineage-specific gene family expansions may be associated with the emergence of specific
functions and physiology. Compared to other mammals, NMR showed a moderate number
of gene families under expansion and contraction (Fig.1b), including 96 NMR lineagespecific gene families (Fig. 2). Analysis of syntenic regions identified 750 gained and 320
lost NMR genes (Supplementary Tables 12-14). At least 75.5% of gained genes showed
evidence of transcription, and the lost genes were enriched for ribosome and nucleoside
biosynthesis functions (Supplementary Table 15). We also identified 244 pseudogenes,
containing 183 frameshift and 119 premature termination events (Supplementary Tables 16
and 17). Functional categories enriched for pseudogenes included olfactory receptor activity
(GO:0004984, P < 0.001, Fisher’s exact test, 36 genes), visual perception (GO:0007601, P =
0.015, CRB1, CRYBB3, GNAT2, GRK7, GUCA1B, and PDE6H), spermatogenesis (GO:
0007283, P = 0.044, ADAM29, ADC, CCIN, CCT6B, DEDD, OAZ3, and SHBG), and
possibly RING domain (SM00184, P = 0.142, CNOT4, KCNRG, RNF5, TRIM17, TRIML1,
and ZSWIM2). The enrichment in the visual perception category appears to underlie the
evolution of poor vision in NMR, whereas many RING domain-containing proteins act as
ubiquitin ligases12. The levels of ubiquitinated proteins in NMRs are lower than in mice and,
unlike those in mice, do not change significantly with age6.

Identification of genes that have undergone positive selection in the NMR lineage can
provide useful pointers to the evolution of its unique traits. 45 genes (0.4%) were identified
as positively selected in the NMR lineage at the false discovery rate (FDR) of 0.01 and 141
genes (1.2%) at the FDR of 0.05 (Supplementary Table 18). 12 out of the 45 genes
(corresponding to the FDR of 0.01) passed a strict manual inspection for the alignment
quality. In comparison, 0.7% of genes were predicted to be positively selected in the human
lineage from high quality alignments and using ROM correction for multiple testing13.
Interestingly, our set included TEP1 encoding a telomerase component and TERF1, a
telomeric repeat binding factor identified at the FDR of 0.05 (Supplementary Fig. 10).
TERF1 gene product is one of six proteins contributing to the shelterin complex that shapes
and protects telomeres15 and that has been proposed to regulate telomere length16.

Author Manuscript

To gain further insights into biological processes that underlie the exceptional traits of
NMR, we identified 39 NMR proteins containing 45 amino acid residues unique among
orthologs present in 36 vertebrate genomes (Supplementary Table 19). This gene set
included cyclin E1 (CCNE1), uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) and γ-crystallin (CRYGS), which
are associated with G1/S transition during the cell cycle, thermogenesis and visual function,
respectively. Noteworthy are also APEX1, a multifunctional DNA repair enzyme, RFC1,
replication factor C, and TOP2A, a DNA topoisomerase that controls the topologic states of
DNA during transcription. This set also contained 8 genes designated as cancer-related
genes14. Finally, TOP2A, along with TEP1 and TERF1 from the set of positively selected
genes, are part of a 5-protein complex of alternate lengthening of telomere pathway17.
Overall, these analyses point to altered telomerase function in NMR, which may be related
to the evolution of the extended lifespan and cancer resistance.

We also identified 1.87 million heterozygous SNPs. This results in an estimated nucleotide
diversity (mean per nucleotide heterozygosity) of 7×10−4, which is much lower than in
mouse and rat populations and is comparable to nucleotide diversity observed in humans.
Transition nucleotide changes were observed twice more frequently than transversions
indicating that variant calls reproduce expected properties of natural variation in other
mammals. The low level of nucleotide diversity may reflect a low effective size of NMR
population, but may also be due to a high level of inbreeding, a reduced mutation rate or
high efficiency of the repair systems. The variation of diversity along the genome was
consistent with inbreeding in the NMR population. In protein-coding regions of the genome,
our analysis identified 10,951 non-synonymous and 8,616 synonymous SNPs. Their ratio is
much higher than in other studied organisms, including human, which appears to signal
relaxation of purifying selection in NMR, potentially as a consequence of reduced effective
population size. Finally, we analyzed context dependency of NMR SNPs (Supplementary
Fig. 11). Relative rates of nucleotide changes and nucleotide context dependencies were
similar to those observed in human polymorphism with the exception of a relative reduction
of SNPs due to CpG mutations. This was caused by a combination of a relatively low CpG
density in the NMR genome and a higher fraction of CpG di-nucleotides within CpG islands
compared to the human genome. CpG density was only 0.19 of the expected under GC
content, which is lower than in human, dog and panda genomes, but is similar to the mouse
genome. However, in comparison to mouse, a higher fraction of CpG di-nucleotides was
concentrated in CpG islands. CpG di-nucleotides within CpG islands contribute less to
genetic variation because of lower methylation rate and possibly also due to selection.

Long lifespan is a key feature of NMR. To study aging and longevity, we obtained RNA-seq
data for brain, liver and kidney of newborn, young adult (4-year old) and old adult (20-year
old) NMRs (Supplementary Table 20). In contrast to other mammals, few genes showed
differential expression between 4 and 20 year old NMRs, especially in the brain
(Supplementary Tables 21-23). A recent study identified 33 under-expressed and 21 overexpressed genes in the human brain during aging18. Of these, 32 genes did not show
consistent expression changes with aging in NMR, 30 had stable expression and 2 changed
in the opposite direction compared to human brain (Supplementary Table 21). For example,
CYP46A1 and SMAD3 were down-regulated in the human brain, but showed elevated
expression in the NMR brain. The product of CYP46A1 gene is a mediator of cholesterol
homeostasis that influences the tendency of Aβ to aggregate. The product of SMAD3 is a
modulator of TGF-β signaling, playing a role in cancer development by slowing down the
rate of cell proliferation. Elevated expression of SMAD3 in NMR during aging may help
optimize the rate of cell death, protecting NMRs from cancer.

A previous meta-analysis of age-related gene expression in mice, rats and humans revealed
56 consistently overexpressed and 17 underexpressed genes19. However, many of these
genes did not show the same expression changes, suggesting that different regulatory
mechanisms may underlie NMR longevity (Supplementary Tables 22 and 23). For example,
genes related to degradation of macromolecules, such as GSTA1, DERL1, and GNS, were
not up-regulated with age in NMRs. We also found that genes encoding mitochondrial
proteins (NDUFB11, ATP5G3, and UQCRQ) were not down-regulated, consistent with

stable maintenance of mitochondrial function during aging. It is also of interest that TERT
(telomerase reverse transcriptase) showed stable expression regardless of age
(Supplementary Fig. 12). This finding is consistent with the role of the telomerase complex
highlighted by positive selection on TEP1 and TERF1. Overall, transcriptome and sequence
data revealed different (compared to humans, mice and rats) patterns of NMR genes, which
may underlie longevity mechanisms in this animal.

Non-shivering thermogenesis is a major heat production process in mammals that mainly
depends on the action of UCP1, one of the 39 vertebrate genes that changed uniquely in
NMR (Supplementary Table 19). UCP1 featured changes in amino acids Gln146, Arg263,
Trp264 and Thr303, with the latter two residues being subject to positive selection (P <
0.05, likelihood ratio test for the branch-site model, n = 30) and Arg263 and Trp264 located
in the conserved nucleotide binding motif (Fig. 3a). With Arg-Trp in place of the rigid GlyPro in the key regulatory site, UCP1 is expected to lose the tight regulation by purine
nucleotides as inhibitors and fatty acids as activators (Fig. 3b and 3c). The same loop also
features two positively charged Lys residues followed by a negatively charged residue (also
a unique combination), that should markedly affect the local electrostatic potential of UCP1.
In addition, Gln146 replaced a conserved His involved in proton transport, and the same
mutation was shown to decrease proton conductance of UCP1 five-fold20. Thr303 is located
in the C-terminal motif (RqTxDCxT) required for binding purine nucleotides21. Taken
together, these observations indicate a tight association of UCP1 function with the unique
thermoregulation in NMR22.

In mammals, switches between light and dark periods affect synthesis of a hormone
melatonin, which modulates sleep and circadian rhythms. NMRs live in the natural dark
habitat and their pineal glands, where melatonin is synthesized, are characterized by
atrophy23, but we found that the genes involved in melatonin synthesis (TPH1, TPH2, DDC,
AANAT and ASMT) are intact. Interestingly, the expression of genes involved in the final
two steps of melatonin synthesis was very low (AANAT) or undetectable (ASMT) in the
NMR brain regardless of age (Supplementary Table 24 and Supplementary Fig. 13).
Moreover, two major mammalian melatonin receptors (MTNR1A and MTNR1B encoding
MT1 and MT2, respectively) were inactivated by mutations that introduce premature stop
signals (Supplementary Fig. 14). Synteny analyses showed that these pseudogenes
corresponded to mouse MTNR1A and MTNR1B. Although melatonin signaling appears to be
disrupted in NMR, its circadian rhythms were maintained in terms of locomotor activity and
body temperature when exposed to periodic light/dark changes24. Our finding is consistent
with the previous report that MT1/MT2 knockout mice maintained essentially normal
circadian rhythms25. These mice also showed decreased insulin secretion25. Likewise, our
transcriptome analysis of NMR revealed decreased expression of genes involved in insulin/
IGF-1 signaling in the liver compared to mice (Supplementary Fig. 15).
To explain the extraordinary resistance of NMR to cancer3, a two-tier protective mechanism
involving contact inhibition mediated by p16Ink4a and p27Kip1 was proposed4. The
involvement of p16Ink4a is unusual, since humans and mice only show contact inhibition
mediated by p27Kip1. We analyzed the gene locus and the transcriptome reads corresponding
to tumor suppressors p16Ink4a and p19Arf. As in mice, the p16Ink4a transcript consists of

three exons (Supplementary Fig. 16). However, sequence similarity in the last exon is low,
and two early stop codons in the second exon were predicted to result in a shorter 14 kDa
protein (Supplementary Fig. 17). The four ankyrin repeats were, however, intact and Thr69,
a residue important for CDK6 binding, was conserved, so the function of the protein may be
partially preserved (Supplementary Fig. 18). The p19Arf transcript consists of two exons, but
four stop codons in the second exon should lead to a shorter 10 kDa protein (Supplementary
Fig. 19-21).
NMR is also unique in that its skin and cutaneous C-fibers lack the neuropeptide Substance
P, making this animal insensitive to certain types of pain9,10. Our analysis revealed the
presence of intact TAC1 encoding Substance P. However, NMR had a deletion in the core
promoter region highly conserved among mammals (Supplementary Fig. 22). Thus, this
neurotransmitter appears to be functional but may be under unique regulation.

We further examined the molecular basis for poor visual function and small eyes in NMR.
Among the four vertebrate opsin genes (RHO, OPN1LW, OPN1MW, and OPN1SW), two
(OPN1LW and OPN1MW) were missing (Table 2); this distinguishes NMR from other
rodents with dichromatic color vision, such as mice, rats, and guinea pigs. However, NMR
has intact RHO (rhodopsin) and OPN4 (melanopsin), supporting the presence of roddominated retinae and the capacity to distinguish light/dark cues. Among about 200 genes
associated with visual perception (GO:0007601) in humans and mice, almost 10% were
inactivated or missing in NMR (Table 2 and Supplementary Fig. 23). These mammalian
genes participate in crystallin formation, phototransduction in the retina, retinal
development, dark adaptation, night blindness and color vision. For at least 10 of these
genes, we observed relaxation of the functional constrain on NMR sequences by estimating
the ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous substitutions, which corroborated the
dysfunction of these genes. Inactivation of CRYBA4, one of microphthalmia-related genes,
may be associated with the small-sized eyes, whereas inactivation of CRYBA4 and CRYBB3
and a NMR-specific mutation in CRYGS (Supplementary Table 19) with abnormal eye
morphology26. Thus, while some genes responsible for vision are preserved in NMR, its
poor visual function may be explained by deterioration of genes coding for various critical
components of the visual system.

Further analysis revealed that substantial divergence of the NMR nuclear receptor
corepressor Hairless from other mammalian orthologs and the presence of amino acid
replacements associated with the hairless phenotype, which is consistent with the lack of fur
in NMRs (Supplementary Fig. 24). In addition, we found substantial sequence variation in
the sweet taste receptor and lack of many bitter taste receptors common to other mammals
(Supplementary Fig. 25 and 26). In particular, NMR appears to lack the
phenylthiocarbamide taste, a dominant genetic trait in humans, as well as several other
common bitter tastes.
Air in NMR burrows is low in O2 (~8%) and high in CO2 (>20%) due to many animals
sharing a limited air supply and poor gas exchange through soil27. To cope with the low O2
conditions, NMR developed adaptive circulatory (altered hemoglobin oxygen affinity) and
metabolic functions reducing metabolic rate and slowing down development1,7,28,29. To

obtain insights into this adaptation, we examined gene expression changes in several tissues
of NMR subjected to 8% O2 for one week (Supplementary Tables 25-31 and Supplementary
Fig. 27-30). Many changes associated with energy metabolism and redox control were
observed. Sequence analysis of NMR hypoxia-induced factor 1α (HIF1α) revealed a T407I
exchange unique among mammals and located in the VHL-binding domain. In normoxia,
VHL mediates ubiquitin-dependent degradation of HIF1α. In addition, NMR VHL harbors
V166I exchange at a functionally important site. These amino acid changes are consistent
with relaxation of ubiquitin-dependent degradation of HIF1α, and, thus, with adaptation to
low oxygen conditions.

To summarize, sequencing and analysis of the NMR genome revealed numerous insights
into the biology of this remarkable animal. In addition, this genome and the associated
datasets offer the research communities working in aging, cancer, eusociality, and many
other areas a rich resource that can be mined in numerous ways to uncover the molecular
bases for the extraordinary traits of the one of the most unusual mammals, NMR. In turn,
this information provides unprecedented opportunities for addressing some of the most
challenging questions in biology and medicine, such as mechanisms of aging, the role of the
genetic makeup in regulating lifespan, adaptations to extreme environments, hypoxia
tolerance, thermogenesis, resistance to cancer, circadian rhythms, sexual development and
hormonal regulation.

Methods Summary

Author Manuscript

The NMR genome was sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform. The sequenced
individual NMR was from a captive breeding colony located at the University of Illinois,
Chicago. The genome was assembled by using SOAPdenovo. We obtained 2.5 G contig
sequences with N50 19.3 kbp and N90 4.7 kbp, and 2.7 G scaffold sequences with N50 1.6
Mbp and N90 0.3 Mbp. RNA-seq data (aging and low O2 experiments) were for animals
from the same colony. See Supplementary Information for data analysis and additional
details.

P-value

Ancestor/NMR indicates that the gene was lost in a rodent ancestor or NMR, respectively. The rate ratio (ω) of non-synonymous to synonymous substitutions was calculated by using human, mouse, rat and
NMR sequences. ω0 is the average ratio in all branches, ω1 is the average ratio in non-NMR branches, and ω2 is the ratio in the NMR branch. A small P-value indicates that the two-ratio model fits the data
better than the one-ratio model.

F: frameshift, S: premature stop codon, L: complete loss detected with synteny information.
