ABSTRACT
Increased risk of breast cancer is a critical side effect associated with the use of a
menopausal hormone therapy (MHT). Estetrol (E4) is a natural estrogen produced by
the human fetal liver and is a promising compound for clinical use in MHT. However, its
impact on breast cancer is controversial and poorly defined. In this preclinical study,
we show that E4 acts as a weak estrogen by stimulating the growth of hormonedependent breast cancer only at concentrations exceeding menopausal therapeutic
needs. E4 presents also an antitumor activity by decreasing the strong proliferative
effect of estradiol (E2). While estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) is the predominant
receptor mediating its effects, the dual weak-estrogenic/anti-estrogenic feature of
E4 results from differential signaling pathways activation. Both nuclear and rapid
extra-nuclear signaling pathway are necessary for a complete estrogenic effect
of E4. However, the antitumor action of E4 is not due to a capacity to antagonize
E2-induced nuclear activity. Altogether, our results highlight that E4 has a limited
impact on breast cancer and may offer a safe therapeutic window for the treatment
of menopausal symptoms.

INTRODUCTION

minimal impact on hepatic and mammary tissues.
Estetrol (E4) is a natural estrogen exclusively
produced by the human fetal liver during pregnancy
[8]. Several animal and in vitro studies indicate that E4
presents a biological profile similar to selective estrogen
receptor modulators (SERMs). It exhibits estrogenlike effects on the brain [9-11], bone [12], uterus [1315], ovulation [16] and atheroma prevention [13]. E4
also presents anti-estrogenic properties in vascular and
central nervous systems since it prevents E2 actions
on endothelial NO synthase activation, acceleration of
endothelial healing and on allopregnanolone synthesis
[10, 13]. In addition, E4 decreases the proliferative effect
of E2 on normal breast epithelial cells [17]. E4 has a

Menopausal complaints such as hot flushes, sexual
and sleep disorders or loss of bone mineral density are
usually relieved by the administration of an estrogen
[1]. However, menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) has
been associated with severe side effects. Due to their
strong hepatic impact, estrogens increase the incidence of
thromboembolic events [2-4]. Moreover the administration
of an estrogen combined with progestin increases the risk
of breast cancer [3, 5-7]. These observations highlight
the need to develop new MHT with safer compounds
that retain the beneficial effects of estrogens on the bone,
uro-genital and central nervous systems, while exhibiting

considerably lower impact on coagulation and hemostasis
than ethinylestradiol (EE) or estradiol (E2) and might
therefore have a minimal impact on the incidence of
thromboembolic events (Foidart, Congress of Eur. Soc.
Gynecol. 2013, personal communication).
These
unique
pharmacological
properties
support that E4 is a suitable and safe compound for
MHT. However, the impact of E4 on breast cancer
is only partially documented, poorly understood and
controversial. It has been reported that E4 prevents and
suppresses mammary tumor growth in rats treated with
DMBA (7,12dimethylbenz(a)anthracene) as efficiently as
ovariectomy or tamoxifen [18]. However, in vitro studies
conducted in ER-positive breast cancer cell lines revealed
that E4 promotes cell growth [19, 20]. In a clinical study
of women with ER-positive breast cancer, it was recently
observed that E4 was pro-apoptotic but did not decrease
the expression of the proliferation marker Ki-67 in tumor
cells [21]. Finally, Giretti [22] reported that E4 moderately
stimulates breast cell migration and invasion but is also
able to antagonize the effect of E2 on these processes.
Seventy percent of breast tumors express the
estrogen receptor alpha (ERα). In these cancers, E2 acts as
a growth factor promoting tumor growth through a highly
complex and not fully understood signaling system. Most
of the actions of E2 are mediated by nuclear receptors
ERα and ERβ [23]. In a classical way, after dimerization
and co-regulators recruitment, the E2/ER complexes
can directly bind estrogen responsive element (ERE) in
the promoter region of target genes to modulate their
expression. ER can also act as co-activators for other
transcription factors such as AP-1 and Sp1 that mediate
the transcription of genes whose promoters do not harbor
ERE [24, 25]. Besides these nuclear effects, E2 also
elicits extra-nuclear actions related to rapid signaling
pathway activation and commonly referred as membrane
initiated steroid signaling (MISS) [26-28]. These effects
are mediated through a pool of membrane-anchored ERα.
Another putative estrogen membrane receptor termed
G protein-coupled estrogen receptor 1 (GPER), also
referred as GPR30, has been proposed to contribute to
physiological and tumor promoting effects of estrogens
[29].
The aim of this study is to define the impact of E4 on
breast cancer growth. We investigated its effect on several
in vitro and in vivo breast cancer models using a large
range of concentrations. Special attention was devoted on
molecular mechanisms driving E4 effects.

E4 is weaker than E2 to increase the growth of
ERα-positive breast cancer cells
We first compared the effect of E2 and E4 on the
growth of MCF-7 breast cancer cells, which express
ERα, ERβ and GPER (Suppl. Figure 1). E2 tested at
concentrations ranging from 1x10-13 to 1x10-4M induced a
typical bell shaped dose-response curve, with a maximal
response of 2.2-fold reached at 1x10-11M (Figure 1A).
High concentrations of E2 (≥1x10-5M) caused a rapid
decline in cell growth, indicative of cytotoxicity. At 1x1011
M, E4 did not increase MCF-7 cell growth (Figure 1B),
but a 1,000-times higher concentration (1x10-8M) was
necessary to promote growth to the same extent than E2.
Dose-response curves for E2 and E4 recorded in the
E-Screen assay (Figure 1C), also showed that E4 produced
a weak agonistic activity compared to E2 with an EC50
of 4x10-9M and a maximal mitogenic effect around 1x107
M, demonstrating a 200 times weaker capacity to induce
MCF-7 BOS cell growth than E2 (EC50 = 2x10-11M).
When used at a stimulating concentration (E2
1x10-9M and E4 1x10-7M), both compounds increased
MCF-7 cell growth in a similar time-dependent manner
(Figure 1D). It is noteworthy to consider that such E4
pharmacological high doses would never be used in
clinical setting.
We then evaluated the impact of E4 on breast
cancer cell lines exhibiting different pattern of estrogen
receptor expression (Suppl. Figure 1): T47D (ERα+,
ERβ-, GPER+), MDA-MB-231 (ERα-, ERβ+, GPER+)
and SKBR3 (ERα-, ERβ-, GPER+) cells. After 72h of
treatment, E2 (1x10-9M) and E4 (1x10-7M) increased
the growth of T47D cells similarly to what was seen for
MCF-7 cells (Figure 1E). By contrast, E2 and E4 failed to
stimulate the growth of MDA-MB-231 (Figure 1F) and
SKBR3 cells (Figure 1G).
Altogether, these data support that E4 increases
cell growth only at high concentrations and that ERα
expression is required for this mitogenic activity.

E4 increases cell growth by stimulating
proliferation and preventing cell death
Estrogens stimulate cell growth in ERα-positive
cells by increasing cell proliferation and reducing
apoptosis [30]. To determine the impact of E4 on
proliferation and cell death, a thymidine incorporation
assay and a quantification of histone-complex DNA
fragments were carried out on MCF-7 cells. As expected,
E2 stimulated the proliferation of MCF7 cells (Figure 2A).
A 100 times higher concentration of E4 was needed to
achieve the same effect. Cells treated with E2 ≤ 1x10-6M

exhibited a ~ 60% lower level of cell death than control
cells but at concentrations > 1x10-6M, E2 dramatically
stimulated cell death (Figure 2B). In a similar way to E2,
E4 reduced the cell death level in treated cells (Figure
2C). Interestingly, in contrast to E2, E4 did not induce cell
death when used at high concentrations. In addition, both
E4 (1x10-7M) and E2 (1x10-9M) significantly decreased
the expression of the pro-apoptotic gene BAD (Figure 2D)
and up-regulated the anti-apoptotic gene BCL2 (Figure
2E), supporting an impact on apoptosis..
A cytotoxicity test revealed that E2 concentrations
ranging from 1x10-10M to 1x10-6M decreased MCF-7
cytotoxicity, but that E2 was concentrations of 1x10-5M
and 1x10-4M were cytotoxic (Figure 2F). E4 did not show
any sign of cytotoxicity for concentrations up to 1x10-4M
(Figure 2G).

effect reached at 1x10-7M (Figure 4A). Similar results
were obtained by using MCF-7 cells (Suppl. Figure 2).
This E4-dependent transcriptional activity was completely
abrogated by the ERα antagonist ICI 182,780 (Figure 4B),
validating the specificity of the above results.

E4 increases cell growth primarily via ERα
Using tamoxifen, an ERα antagonist in the breast,
and ICI 182 780, a pure ERα antagonist, we observed that
the combinations of E4 with both antiestrogens decreased
MCF-7 cell growth to level of untreated cells (Figure 3A).
This observation confirms that the stimulating effect of
E4 is mediated by ERα. ERα is described to be activated
by phosphorylation on key serine residues among which
Ser118, the major phosphorylation site when the receptor
is activated by estrogens, and Ser167 phosphorylated
through the EGF/EGFR pathways [31]. The stimulation
of MCF-7 cells with E2 (1x10-9M) or E4 (1x10-7M) led
to a robust phosphorylation of Ser118 and to a weak
phosphorylation of Ser167 (Figure 3B), highlighting the
activation of ERα by these compounds. While E4 was
unable to stimulate the proliferation of SKBR3 cells
which express GPER but not ERα, G15, a reported GPER
antagonist, partially decreased the E2- and E4-induced
MCF-7 cell growth (Figure 3C).
These data confirm our above observations (Figure
1) that ERα is the predominant receptor mediating the
mitogenic effects of E4. They also suggest a possible
contribution of GPER to this process. It has been indeed
suggested that GPER may facilitate membrane-initiated
steroid signaling under limited circumstances [32].

To assess the impact of E4 on the activation and

gene assay based on T47D-KBluc cells in presence of
increasing concentrations of E2 or E4. As expected, E2
induced a strong ERE-Luc transactivation in T47D cells
with an EC50 value of 1x10-11M. E4 also stimulated ERELuc transactivation, but the curve was shifted to higher
concentrations, with an EC50 of 1x10-8M, and a maximal

The weaker capacity of E4 to induce the binding
of ERα to ERE was confirmed in a second model: the
Yeast Estrogen Screen (Figure 4C), which is based on
the ability of a compound to stimulate the expression
of β-galactosidase in yeast by activating ERα. The
normalized data showed that E4 had a potency of
approximately 10,000 times less than E2 to activate the
receptor and promote β-galactosidase production in the
yeast.
We next investigated the capacity of E4 to promote
non-classical nuclear effects by assessing the expression
of genes that do not harbor ERE in their promoter
region: BRCA1 and CCDN1. These genes are thought to
be regulated by the recruitment of ERα to AP-1 or Sp1
sites in the promoter region [33, 34]. Following 6 hours
of incubation, both E4 (1x10-7M) and E2 (1x10-9M) upregulated BRCA1 and CCDN1 mRNA (Figure 4D-4E).
Finally, to further demonstrate the transcriptional
activation of ERα, we evaluated the induction of the

progesterone receptor (PGR) protein, a well described
estrogen-dependent process [35]. E4 led to a significant
up-regulation of PGR in MCF-7 cells. At least 1x10-10M
of E4 was required while E2 achieved a maximal effect
at a concentration as low as 1x10-13M (Figure 4F). The
induction of PGR in MCF-7 cells by E2 (1x10-9M) and E4
(1x10-7M) was also highlighted by immunofluochemistry
(Figure 4G).
Altogether these data support that E4 is a weak
inducer of ERα transcriptional activity by activating both
classical and non-classical nuclear effects with a lower
efficiency than E2.

E4 activates extra-nuclear signaling cascades in
breast cancer cells
The extra-nuclear effects of E2 on breast cancer
rely on the activation of MAPK and PI3K/AKT pathways

E4 increases breast tumor growth in vivo only
at high concentrations, and antagonizes E2dependent effect

[36, 37]. Like E2 (1x10-9M), E4 (1x10-7M) increased the
phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in a fast and transient manner,
with a maximal activation seen after 5 min followed by
a decline within 10 minutes (Figure 5A). U0126, an
inhibitor of the upstream MEK1/2, completely abolished
ERK1/2 phosphorylation attesting that the observed
phosphorylation was induced by MEK in MCF-7 cells
(Figure 5B). We also observed an increase in ERK1/2 and
AKT phosphorylation in vivo in MCF-7 tumors resected
from mice treated with E4 or E2 during 5 weeks (Figure
5C).
These results support that, in addition to nuclear
effects, E4 is also able to activate extra-nuclear ERK1/2
and PI3K/AKT pathways.

An estrogen supplementation is necessary for the
growth of MCF-7 and the formation of tumor in vivo.
To determine if E4 could achieve the same effect than
E2, ovariectomized immunodeficient mice implanted
with MCF-7 cells received a daily oral treatment of E4
(0.5, 1, 3 or 10 mg/kg/day) or E2 (3 mg/kg/day). After 5
weeks of treatment, E2 promoted tumor growth and tumor
weights were 5-fold increased compared to the untreated
group (Figure 6A). However, no significant difference
was observed between untreated control group and mice

treated with E4 0.5 mg/kg/day. E4 was as efficient as E2 in
promoting tumor growth only at the dose of 10 mg/kg/day.
We then analyzed the effect of a combined treatment
of E2 and E4 on MCF-7 tumor growth. Ovariectomized
mice implanted with MCF-7 cells and with an E2 pellet
received a daily oral treatment of E4 (1, 3 or 10mg/kg/
day) during 5 weeks (Figure 6B). In these conditions,
E4 antagonized E2-induced tumor growth in a dosedependent manner. Exposure to the combination E2+E4
decreased the tumor volume and tumor weight by ~50%

compared to mice exposed to E2 alone (Figure 6B-6C).
This partial anti-estrogenic effect of E4 in the presence of
E2 was also observed in vitro on MCF-7 cell proliferation.
This effect became maximal when E4 was at least 100
times more concentrated than E2 (Figure 6D).
Altogether, these results indicate that E4 used alone
acts as a weak estrogen and stimulates the growth of MCF7 tumor in vivo only at high concentrations. Interestingly,
at these concentrations, E4 partially antagonized the protumoral effect of E2.

E4 does not antagonize suppress the nuclear ERα
actions

than 10 nM, E4 exhibits an estrogenic activity by
promoting breast cancer cell growth in line with previous
in vitro studies [19, 20]. It is important to consider that
doses of E4 necessary to elicit such estrogenic effect on
malignant breast cells are high pharmacological doses that
would not be used for therapeutic purposes. Interestingly,
E4 also presents an antitumor activity by reducing the
strong mitogenic effect induced by E2, with a maximal
antagonist effect seen when the concentration ratio E4/
E2 is equal to 100. Our findings can contribute to explain
that high doses of E4 suppress mammary tumors induced
by DMBA in rats [18]. This unique dual activity of E4
observed on breast cancer is also in line with promising
data we previously reported on the reduced impact of E4
on normal mammary gland proliferation [17].
Preclinical studies have demonstrated that 0.3mg
E4/kg/day abolishes hot flushes in a rat model [11] and
that 0.5mg E4/kg/day elicits bone-sparing effects [12].
Moreover, in women, a daily oral dose of 2 mg E4 (~
0.03mg/kg/day) has an estrogenic effect on vaginal
cytology while having a neutral protective effect on
endometrial proliferation (Foidart & Coelingh Bennink,
congress of International Menopause Society 2014,
personal communication). Notably, in our experimental
conditions, these E4 doses failed to promote breast tumor
growth. While the stimulation of breast cancer growth by
E4 requires doses 100 to 1000-fold higher than E2, E4
doses that are only 2-4 times higher than E2 abrogate
efficiently the clinical symptoms of menopause in other
target tissues (brain and vaginal keratinocytes). These data
clearly highlight that E4 could be effective in women for
the relief of menopausal symptoms at doses associated
with no or limited impact on the breast, suggesting a large
window of therapeutic safety.
The properties of E4 concerning cell proliferation
and apoptosis pointed out in this work are in line with
previous studies showing that estrogens promote breast
cancer not only by stimulating cell proliferation but also
by impacting the apoptotic pathways [30]. Nevertheless,
our results diverge from the observations of Singer [21]
reporting an increase of apoptosis in tumor of women
treated during 14 days with 20mg E4 (~ 0.3mg/kg/day).
As pointed out by the authors, this study was a small
exploratory trial in which immunohistochemical analyses
were conducted on a limited number of breast cancer
samples. In contrast to E2, E4 is not cytotoxic even at
concentrations higher than 1x10-6M, suggestive of a good
tolerability. This observation is in agreement with the high
E4 concentrations naturally found in the amniotic fluid and
in the fetal and maternal plasma during pregnancy rising to
60 nM and evidently safe for the fetus and the mother [39].
Our results clearly demonstrate that ERα is
necessary to drive the mitogenic effect of E4 on breast
cancer growth. Since 70 % of breast cancers are diagnosed
positive for ERα, this observation further underlines the
crucial need to precisely characterize the impact of E4

We demonstrated above that E4 induces both nuclear
and extra-nuclear signaling, albeit less efficiently than E2.
Thus, trying to understand the mechanisms underlying the
antagonistic effects of E4 on E2, we assessed the impact
of E2+E4 combination on ERE-dependent activity of ERα.
Increasing concentrations of E4 were combined with two
different concentrations of E2 (1x10-11M and 1x10-9M)
inducing submaximal and maximal effects, respectively
(Figure 7A). In these conditions, E4 failed to antagonize
the effects of E2 on ERE-Luc transactivation induction in
T47D-KBluc cells. On the contrary, a cumulative effect of
both compounds was observed when E2 was used at the
submaximal concentration to reach maximal ERE activity
(Figure 7B). No effect of E4 was observed on luciferase
activity when E2 was used at a dose that already induced
maximal ERE activity (Figure 7C). Same results were
obtained using ERE-Luc transfected MCF-7 cells line
(Suppl. Figure 3).
Further experiments were conducted by predicting
and testing the effect of a binary mixture between E2 and
E4. The prediction was calculated with dose addition, a
commonly used concept in toxicology for the prediction
of chemical mixture additive effects [38]. The prediction
was then tested experimentally. Data showed that the
predicted combination effect agreed very well with the
experimentally observed data (Figure 7D) confirming that
E2 and E4 do not have any antagonistic effect on ERα
binding to ERE when they are combined. Moreover, the
combination of E2+E4 failed to modulate the E2-induced
expression of genes harboring ERE in their promoter
region, such as pS2, BCL2 and PGR at mRNA and/or
protein level (Figure 7E-7G).
These data clearly demonstrate that E4 does not
antagonize the nuclear actions induced by E2.

DISCUSSION
The identification of new estrogenic compounds
for MHT that selectively preserve the beneficial effects
of estrogens while reducing their unwanted side effects,
such as breast cancer promotion, is largely needed. Several
evidences have suggested that E4 could act as a SERM
[9-16]. However, its impact on breast cancer remains
controversial and poorly understood since it is reported to
be either an estrogen or an anti-estrogen. The preclinical
results presented in this study indicate a dose-dependent
dual weak estrogenic/anti-estrogenic activity of E4 on
breast cancer and delineate a safe therapeutic window for
menopause treatment.
Below 10 nM, E4 does not increase breast cancer
growth, while E2 already causes a maximal stimulation.
On the other hand, when used at concentrations higher

on breast cancer before any clinical use for MHT. The
contribution of GPER to estrogen-induced signaling in
breast cancer remains a matter of debate. Some studies
report a contribution of GPER in the signaling induced by
E2 [40] and in the proliferation of normal and malignant
breast [41], although other reports failed to demonstrate
this kind of observations [42]. In our experimental
conditions, we observed that GPER was not sufficient to
induce breast cancer cell growth. However, preliminary
evidences suggest that it could partially contribute to this
effect and to E4-induced signaling. One possibility is that
E4 binds and activates ERα, and this communicates to
membrane localized GPER. This specific controversial
issue oversteps the purpose of this study and will have
to be addressed with appropriates tools since the possible
involvement of GPER in E4 signaling suggested here,
only relies on the specificity of G15 as a GPER antagonist.
Mechanistically, we demonstrate that E4 induces
both nuclear and extra-nuclear signaling pathways.
This agonistic profile of E4 on nuclear ERα activation
observed in breast cancer is consistent with previous in
vivo experiments performed on three recognized nuclear
ERα-dependent processes showing that high doses of E4
promote uterine gene expression, endometrial proliferation
and prevention of atheroma [13]. The antagonistic activity
exerted by E4 on E2-dependent breast cancer growth is
clearly not mediated by a modulation of these ERα nuclear
actions. This corroborates the observation that E4 fails to
antagonize E2-dependent uterotrophic effects driven by
ERα nuclear actions [13]. In contrast, E4 antagonizes
E2 extra-nuclear effects in the endothelium resulting in
an inhibition of eNOS phosphorylation and NO release
[13]. In breast cancer cells, we previously reported that a
5 minutes stimulation with either E2 or E4 significantly
stimulated the cytoplasmic interaction between ERα and
Src. Rather surprisingly, the combination E2+E4 had no
stimulatory effect on this interaction [13]. In addition,
E4 decreases the E2-induced moesin phosphorylation,
leading to a subsequent reduction of cell migration [22].
The molecular mechanisms driving extra-nuclear actions
of estrogens are far from being fully understood. The
downstream targets regulated by the membrane-associated
form of ERα involve various post-transcriptional
modifications that highly differ between cell types. In
addition, the number and variety of signaling proteins
involved convey specificity to the estrogen signaling
in a cell- and context-dependent fashion and result in
differential cell activities [26]. Thus, it is important to
consider a possible involvement of GPER and other
signaling molecules in modulating E4 action on malignant
breast cells.
In summary, a major issue to improve
postmenopausal women’s health is to identify new
compounds that present an estrogenic effect on the
vagina, the bone, cardiovascular and central nervous
systems, while having minimal impact on the breast. The
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

exclusive dual weak estrogenic/anti-estrogenic activity
of E4, through tissue-specific crosstalk between nuclear
and extra-nuclear signaling pathways, opens promising
possibilities. There is, of course, a large frontier between
preclinical mechanistic studies and clinical performance of
any new drug. Therefore, clinical studies are now needed
to confirm the efficacy and the safety of E4 to relieve
menopausal symptoms.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Chemicals, drugs and antibodies
17β-estradiol (E2), epidermal growth factor (EGF),
tamoxifen and fulvestrant (ICI 182,780) were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich (St-Louis, MO, USA). G15 (GPERantagonist) was obtained from Cayman Chemical
Company (Ann Arbor, MI, USA). E4 was supplied by
Uteron Pharma (Liège, Belgium). All compounds were
dissolved in ethanol (EtOH). Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle
medium (DMEM), Roswell Park Memorial Institute
medium (RPMI), fetal bovine serum (FBS), dextrancoated charcoal treated-FBS, MEM-non-essential
amino acid, glutamate, penicillin and streptomycin were
purchased from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA, USA). ERα
and GPER antibodies were purchased from Santa-Cruz
Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA, USA). ERβ and PGR

BCL2 antibody was from Dako (Trappes, France).
Antibodies for phospho-ERα, phospho-ERK1/2, total
ERK1/2 and phospho-AKT were obtained from Cell
Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA, USA).

Cell culture
Human breast cancer cells (MCF-7, T47D, MDAMB-231 and SKBR3) were purchased and authenticated
from ATCC. All cell lines were authenticated within
1 year before being used in experiments. Cells were
routinely cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10%
FBS, L-glutamine (2 mmol/L), penicillin (100 IU/mL)
and streptomycin (100µg/mL) at 37°C in a 5% CO2 humid
atmosphere. 24 h before the experiments with steroids, the
medium was removed and replaced with DMEM without
phenol red supplemented with dextran-coated charcoaltreated FBS to exclude estrogenic effects caused by the
medium or the serum.

Cell growth assay and cell proliferation assay
Cells were seeded in 96-well culture plates at a
density of 5,000 cells/well and then incubated for 72 h
with different concentrations of E4 or E2. Cell growth was

dosing the total quantity of DNA in a well. The amount
of fluorescence was measured on a plate reader at a
wavelength of excitation/emission 480/520 nm.
Cell proliferation was measured using thymidine
incorporation. 24 h after the beginning of hormonal
treatment, cells were incubated with 2 µCi of methyl-3[H]
thymidine for 48 h at 37°C. After incubation, cells were
washed and incubated in 5% Trichloroacetic acid for 15
min at 4°C and lysed in NAOH 0.1M for 15 min at 37°C.
The total lysate was added to 25 µl of scintillation liquid
and radioactivity was counted with a β-counter (Beckman,
LS-5000-CE).

with 10mM Tris. The optical density (O.D.) was read at
510 nm directly in the same plate on a microplate reader
(Labsystems Multiskan, UK).

Cell death assay
MCF-7 cells were seeded in 96-well plates (5,000
cells/well) and left to adhere overnight. Cells were then
treated with indicated compound and concentration. After
72 h of treatment, apoptosis level (histone-associated
DNA fragments) was determined using the Cell Death
Detection Elisa from Roche (Bâle, Switzerland) following
the protocol provided by the manufacturer. Briefly, the
cytoplasmic fractions were added to the 96-well ELISA
plates pre-coated with the anti-histone monoclonal
antibody and incubated for 2 h at room temperature.
After washing, bound nucleosomes were detected by the
addition of anti–DNA-peroxidase monoclonal antibody
and reacted for 1h at room temperature. After the addition
of substrate, the optical density was read with a microplate
reader at 405 nm. Values were normalized to ADN content
in each well.

E-screen assay
MCF-7 BOS cells are highly estrogen-responsive
breast cancer cells and for this reason, considered as the
most appropriate cell line for the E-Screen [43]. MCF7 BOS cells were routinely maintained in DMEM with
Glutamax supplemented with 5% FBS and 1% MEMnon-essential amino acids. The assay was conducted as
described previously [43]. Briefly, cells were seeded into
96-well plates at a density of 2,500 cells per well and
allowed to attach for 24h. The seeding media was then
replaced with the experimental medium consisting of
phenol-red free DMEM supplemented with 1% sodium
pyruvate, 1% MEM-NEAA and 10% CD-FBS. Each plate
contained 1 row (8 wells) negative controls (0,5% EtOH),
1 row positive controls (saturating concentration E2) and
8 increasing concentrations of the test chemical, tested
in duplicate. Following 120 h incubation, the assay was
terminated and the cells were fixed with a 10% solution of
ice cold trichloroacetic acid for 25 min. The plates were
then washed with water, allowed to air dry and stained
with 0.4% sulforhodamine B in 1% acetic acid for 10
min. Unbound dye was completely removed by rinsing
with 1% acetic acid and bound SRB was solubilized

Cytotoxicity assay
The cell cytotoxicity was determined after 72
h of treatment using the ApoTox-Glo Triplex Assay
kit from Promega (Fitchburg, WI, USA) following
the manufacturer’s protocol. Fluorescent signal was
determined using the plate reader Victor II-PerkinElmer.
Values were normalized to ADN content in each well.

Luciferase gene reporter assay
The ER-LUC assay was performed as previously
described [44]. Briefly, for seven days prior to
experiments, T47D-KBluc cells were maintained in low
estrogen conditions by the use of pre-assay media (RPMI,
17632

Quantitative real-time PCR

10% charcoal-dextran stripped FCS, no antibiotics). For
experiments, cells were seeded in white 96-well plates at a
density of 10,000 cells/well and allowed to attach for 24h
before removal of media, and application of test chemicals
in dosing media (phenol red-free RPMI, 5% charcoaldextran stripped FCS, no antibiotics). The positive control
was 1 nM E2. 24h after application of test and control
solutions, a volume of Steady-Glo assay reagent from
Promega (Fitchburg, USA) equal to the volume of culture
media was added to allow the cell lysis. Plates were then
loaded into a plate reader followed by measurement of
luminescence (FLUOstar Optima, BMG Labtech GmbH).

Total RNA was extracted from cells using
Trizol Reagent from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA, USA)
according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The cDNA was
synthesized with 2 µg of total RNA using random primers
for 1h at 37°C. Real-time quantitative PCR was performed
using specific primers and Brilliant SYBR GREEN QPCR
master mix from Qiagen (Hilden, Germany). GAPDH
was amplified as an internal control. Sequence primers for
target genes are reported in table 1.

Immunofluorescence staining

The recombinant yeast estrogen screen

Cells were grown on coverslips. After treatment,
cells were fixed 10 minutes at room temperature with
paraformaldehyde 4%- HEPES 250nM. Cells were
permeabilized 30 minutes at room temperature with PBSTriton 1%. After saturation of non-specific sites with 1%
PBS-BSA, cells were then incubated 2 hours at 37°C
with progesterone receptor primary antibody. Cells were
subsequently incubated for 20 minutes at 37°C with the
fluorescent Alexa Fluor 488 conjugated IgG secondary
antibody. Then, cells were stained with DAPI and the
coverslips were mounted on slides with the Prolog Gold
reagent from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA, USA).

The assay was carried out exactly as described
previously [45]. Briefly, growth media was inoculated
with yeast stock and grown overnight in an orbital shaker
at 28°C. The assay medium consisted of 50 ml of growth
medium, chlorophenol red-ß-D-galactopyranoside (10
mg/l) and 2 ml of the overnight yeast culture. Aliquots
of 10 μl of the ethanolic dilutions of E2 or E4 were
transferred to 96-well plates and allowed to evaporate to
dryness. Final tested concentrations of E2 and E4 ranged
between 1×10−12 and 1×10−8, and 1×10−8 and 1×10−4 M,
respectively. All plates included a row of EtOH controls
(i.e. no test agent) and a row of assay medium without
yeast cells (blanks). To each well, except the blanks,
a volume of 200 μl of yeast-seeded assay medium was
added. Plates were sealed and shaken vigorously for 2
min before incubating at 32 °C, in a humidified box for
72h. Plates were then analyzed spectrophotometrically at
540 nm (color) and 620 nm (turbidity) using a Labsystem
Multiskan Multisoft plate reader.

In vivo experiments
Immunodeficient mice were ovariectomized to
prevent endogenous estrogen production. MCF-7 cells
(2x106 cells suspended in 400 µl Matrigel) were injected
subcutaneously into each flank of mice. Mice received
then a daily oral administration of vehicle (peanut oil +
5% EtOH), E2 (3mg/kg/day) or E4 (0.5 to 10 mg/kg/day).
Mice were sacrificed and tumor weighed after 5 weeks
of treatment. For combined treatment of E2+E4, mice
were implanted subcutaneously with a pellet releasing
E2 (1.7 mg, Innovative Research of America). When
tumors were palpable and reached an average area of
40-50mm2, animals were divided into several groups
(5 animals /group). E2 pellets were removed from mice
of the control untreated group. Other groups received a
fresh E2-releasing pellet and a daily oral treatment of
vehicle (peanut oil + 5% EtOH) or E4 (1, 3 and 10 mg/
kg/day). Tumors were measured every week with digital
caliper and tumor volume was calculated as V (mm3) = π
x [(width)2 x length]/6. After 5 weeks of treatment, mice
were sacrificed. We systematically checked that untreated
ovariectomized mice had an atrophied uterus (<10 mg)
and that mice implanted with an E2-releasing pellet
had a significant increase of uterine weight. All animal
procedures were performed according to the Federation of
European Laboratory Animal Sciences Associations within

Western blot analysis
Cell were exposed to test chemicals during
appropriate time, and then lysed in lysis buffer containing
a protease inhibitor. 20 µg of whole cell total proteins were
separated onto SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to
nitrocellulose membrane. Membrane was blocked with 5%
milk/PBS/Tween and incubated with primary antibodies
overnight at 4°C. Membranes were then washed and
incubated with appropriate HRP-conjugated secondary
antibodies and detected using an ECL system. β-actin was
used as a control for equal loading and total protein in
case of phosphorylated protein. Results of densitometry
analyses of western blots, obtained using QuantityOne
software from Biorad (Hercules, CA, USA), are presented
as optical densities relative to the control.

considered as statistically significant.

Histological analysis
To carry out histological analysis, tumor samples
were fixed in 4% formalin for 4h and stored in 70% EtOH
before paraffin embedding. The sections were cut at 6
µm. For detection of pERK and pAKT, the slides were
deparaffinized in xylene and rehydrated through graded
alcohols. For antigen retrieval, sections were heated in
10 mM citrate buffer for 10 min. The sections were then
treated with 3% H2O2 for 20 min to block endogenous
peroxidase activity, washed with PBS, and incubated
with 10% BSA for 1h. After blocking, the sections were
incubated with the pERK antibody and pAKT antibody at
1:100, and 1:250 dilutions respectively. The slides were
then incubated with biotinylated secondary antibodies for
30 min, followed by 30 min incubation with streptavidin–
peroxidase conjugate. Antigen– antibody complex was
visualized by incubation with 3,30-diaminobenzidine
5. The slides were counterstained with hematoxylin,
dehydrated, and mounted using a mounting medium from
Labonord (Templemars, France). Positively stained cells
appeared brown.

Preparation of mixtures and calculation of
mixture effect predictions using dose addition
model

CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

Dose addition (DA) is a widely used
pharmacological concept for the prediction of chemical
mixture effects when only the effect of individual
components is known. This hypothesis expresses the
expected combination effect based on the assumption
that all mixture components exert their effects without
influencing each other’s action. Using the DA additivity
prediction, it is then possible to assess experimentally
observed mixture effects in terms of synergisms or
antagonisms [38]. Here, the mixture experiment was
designed according to the fixed mixture ratio design,
where serial dilutions of a stock solution of a mixture of
E4 and E2 were made and then tested.
The mathematical and statistical procedures used
for calculating DA mixture effects are described in [46].
Differences between predicted and observed effects
were deemed statistically significant when the prediction
did not overlap with the 95% confidence belts of the
experimentally observed mixture effects.
