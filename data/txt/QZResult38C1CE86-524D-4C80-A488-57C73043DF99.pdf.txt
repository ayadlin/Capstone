Abstract
MVA-BN-PRO (BN ImmunoTherapeutics) is a candidate immunotherapy product for the treatment of
prostate cancer. It encodes 2 tumor-associated antigens, prostate-specific antigen (PSA), and prostatic acid
phosphatase (PAP), and is derived from the highly attenuated modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA) virus stock
known as MVA-BN. Past work has shown that the immunogenicity of antigens can be improved by targeting
their localization to exosomes, which are small, 50- to 100–nm diameter vesicles secreted by most cell types.
Exosome targeting is achieved by fusing the antigen to the C1C2 domain of the lactadherin protein. To test
whether exosome targeting would improve the immunogenicity of PSA and PAP, 2 additional versions of MVABN-PRO were produced, targeting either PSA (MVA-BN-PSA-C1C2) or PAP (MVA-BN-PAP-C1C2) to exosomes,
while leaving the second transgene untargeted. Treatment of mice with MVA-BN-PAP-C1C2 led to a striking
increase in the immune response against PAP. Anti-PAP antibody titers developed more rapidly and reached
levels that were 10- to 100-fold higher than those for mice treated with MVA-BN-PRO. Furthermore, treatment
with MVA-BN-PAP-C1C2 increased the frequency of PAP-specific T cells 5-fold compared with mice treated with
MVA-BN-PRO. These improvements translated into a greater frequency of tumor rejection in a PAP-expressing
solid tumor model. Likewise, treatment with MVA-BN-PSA-C1C2 increased the antigenicity of PSA compared
with treatment with MVA-BN-PRO and resulted in a trend of improved antitumor efficacy in a PSA-expressing
tumor model. These experiments confirm that targeting antigen localization to exosomes is a viable approach
for improving the therapeutic potential of MVA-BN-PRO in humans. Cancer Res; 71(15); 5235–44. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
MVA-BN-PRO (BN ImmunoTherapeutics) is a candidate
immunotherapy product for the treatment of prostate cancer
that is currently in a phase I clinical trial (1). This recombinant
vector is derived from a clonal isolate of the highly attenuated
modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA) virus stock known as MVA-BN
and encodes 2 validated tumor-associated antigens (TAA),
prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and prostatic acid phosphatase
(PAP). PSA is a secreted protein found at elevated levels in the
serum of men with prostate cancer (2). Recently, PSA has shown
promise as an immunotherapy tumor antigen for prostate
cancer patients. In a phase II trial of PROSTVAC (BN ImmunoAuthors' Affiliations: 1Department of Research and Development, BN

Therapeutics), a poxviral-based immunotherapy that targets
PSA, treated patients showed an average increase in median
survival of 8.5 months compared with those treated with control
vectors (3). PAP is a glycosylated phosphatase found in prostate
epithelium which occurs either as an intracellular or secreted
protein (4). PAP has recently been validated as an antigen for
prostate cancer immunotherapy through the approval of the
dendritic cell–based therapy sipuleucel-T (5, 6). Therefore, the
inclusion of both PSA and PAP as transgenes in MVA-BN-PRO is
hoped to provide improved efficacy in prostate cancer patients
compared with therapies targeting only a single antigen.
A technology platform called exosome display has recently
been described that exploits the exosome pathway for a broad
range of applications including vaccine (7, 8) and therapeutic
antibody development (9). Exosomes are 50- to 100–nm
diameter membrane vesicles secreted into the extracellular
space. They bind or fuse with neighboring cells in a process
thought to allow cell-to-cell communication at a distance. The
effects of exosomes on the immune system have become the
subject of increasing interest due to studies showing that they
can provide activating signals through several different
mechanisms. For example, exosomes produced by antigenpresenting cells (APC) contain MHC class I and class II
complexes along with costimulatory proteins, and purified
exosomes can activate CD4 or CD8 T cells. Furthermore,

exosomes purified from other cell types can spread antigens or
peptide-loaded MHC complexes to APCs for more efficient
presentation (see ref. 10 for a review on the effects of exosomes
on immune cells). One modality used for exosome display of
antigens is the generation of chimeric expression constructs
encoding a protein of interest fused to the C1C2 domain of
lactadherin (7). Lactadherin is released via the exosome
secretory pathway by binding to the vesicle surface, and
chimeric proteins containing the C1C2 domain of lactadherin
have been shown to be released into the extracellular milieu
bound to exosomes. The potential of this technology for
vaccine application was recently illustrated in studies where
vaccination of mice with a DNA vector encoding chicken
ovalbumin (OVA) fused to the C1C2 domain slowed the
growth of OVA-expressing tumors more than vaccination
with vectors encoding membrane-bound or secreted OVA
(11). Although OVA is a commonly used model antigen in
proof-of-principle studies, this technology has not been validated for therapeutically relevant tumor antigens.
Here, we describe studies to test whether the immunogenicity or therapeutic efficacy of MVA-BN-PRO can be improved
by targeting PSA or PAP to exosomes. Two additional MVABN-PRO vectors were made, one modified to express PSAC1C2 and wild-type PAP, and the other modified to express
PAP-C1C2 and wild-type PSA. Treatment of mice with the
MVA-BN-PRO vector encoding exosome-targeted PAP led to a
striking increase in the immune response against PAP. More
importantly, it resulted in enhanced antitumor activity against
a syngeneic tumor expressing PAP when compared with
vectors encoding the wild-type transgene. Likewise, treatment
with the viral vector encoding exosome-targeted PSA
increased the antigenicity of PSA and showed a trend of
improved antitumor activity in a PSA-expressing solid tumor
model. These experiments show that targeting tumor-associated antigens to exosomes is a viable approach for improving the therapeutic potential of MVA-BN-PRO for the
treatment of prostate cancer in humans.

Materials and Methods
DNA expression plasmids and cell lines
Four DNA expression vectors were constructed using
pcDNA3.1/Zeo or pcDNA3.1/Hygro (Invitrogen) to express
either wild-type or C1C2-fused versions of PSA or PAP:
pPSA/Zeo, pPSA-C1C2/Zeo, pPAP/Hygro, and pPAP-C1C2/
Hygro under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter.
The open reading frame (ORF) of human PSA or human PAP
was amplified by PCR from the pCR2.1 PSA or the pCR2.1 PAP
vectors (Bavarian Nordic) using primers that added a 50 Kozak
translation initiation sequence and unique restriction sites
flanking the ORFs to aid in cloning. To generate constructs
encoding C-terminal fusions to the C1C2 domain of lactadherin, this domain was amplified from vector p6mLC1C2 (7)
using the forward primer 50 -accgaatacatctgccagtgcc-30 and the
reverse primer 50 -cactgtaagcttaacagcccagcagctccagg-30 . This
product was then blunt-end ligated to the PCR-amplified ORF
of PSA or PAP and then cloned into the multiple cloning site
of pcDNA3.1/Zeo or pcDNA3.1/Hygro, respectively.

HEK293-F cells (Invitrogen) were grown as adherent cultures in Dulbecco's modiﬁed Eagle's medium (DMEM) media
with 4.5 g/L glucose, L-glutamine, sodium pyruvate, and 10%
FBS (Mediatech, Inc.) and transfected with plasmid DNA
from one of the 4 DNA expression plasmids described above
using the Lipofectamine LTX reagent and PLUS Reagent
(Invitrogen). Cells were selected on media supplemented with
250 mg/mL of Zeocin or Hygromycin B (Invitrogen) as appropriate for the plasmid. Drug-resistant cells were single-cell
cloned to generate cell lines.
E6 cells (12) express human PSA and were grown in DMEM
media with 10% FBS (Mediatech). CT26 cells (13) were
obtained from American Type Culture Collection and grown
in Iscove's DMEM with 2 mmol/L L-glutamine, 25 mmol/L
HEPES, and supplemented with 5% FBS or bovine calf serum
(BCS; Mediatech, Inc.). To generate CT26-PAP cell lines, CT26
cells were transfected with the pPAP/Hygro plasmid and
selected for drug-resistant clones as described for HEK293-F
cells. PAP expression was verified in conditioned media with
the UBI Magiwel PAP Quantitative Test ELISA (United Biotech). Cell lines have not been independently authenticated.
Viruses
MVA-BN-PRO was modified using vectors derived from the
above DNA expression plasmids to create MVA-BN-PSA-C1C2
and MVA-BN-PAP-C1C2. All viral vectors were produced and
assayed for 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) by
Bavarian Nordic according to established methods (14). In
addition to the TCID50 assay, the infectious unit (IU) titers of
the viral stocks were determined at BN ImmunoTherapeutics
using flow cytometry (15).
Western blotting
CT26 cells grown in 6-well plates were incubated with MVABN-PSA-C1C2 or MVA-BN-PAP-C1C2 for 24 hours, scraped
from the wells, washed in cold PBS, and resuspended in NP40
Cell Lysis Buffer (Invitrogen) containing the Protease Inhibitor
Cocktail Set III (EMD Chemicals). Soluble protein was applied
to SDS-PAGE gels, electrophoresed under reducing conditions, and electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes using the iBlot system (Invitrogen). Proteins were
detected using the WesternBreeze Chromogenic Immunodetection Kit (Invitrogen) with a mouse anti-human PAP monoclonal antibody (clone 4LJ; Santa Cruz Biotech) or a rabbit
anti-human PSA polyclonal antibody (DAKO). Purified PSA or
PAP was used as reference protein (Meridian Life Science
Inc.).
Anti-CD81 cross-capture ELISA
To prepare media enriched with exosomes for analysis by
the anti-CD81 cross-capture ELISA, HEK293-F cell lines were
grown as described above and then seeded at 2  106 cells/mL
and grown as a suspension culture in 100 to 200 mL of the
chemically defined, protein-free media CD 293 supplemented
with 4 mmol/L L-glutamine (Invitrogen) for 5 to 7 days.
Conditioned media was concentrated and filtered as described for a miniscale purification of exosomes (16), except
ultracentrifugation over a sucrose cushion was not done.

Exosome Targeting of Tumor Antigens Improves Efficacy

The anti-CD81 cross-capture ELISA was done as described
(9, 16) with modifications. The 96-well plates were coated with
an anti-CD81 antibody (clone JS-81, BD Biosciences) at a
concentration of 4 mg/mL in PBS, washed with 0.05%
Tween-20 in PBS, blocked with 3% BSA in PBS for 1 hour,
and washed again. Two-fold dilutions of exosome-enriched
media were added to each well and incubated at room
temperature for 12 hours to allow binding of exosomes to
the plate via the anti-CD81 antibody. Wells were washed, and
PSA was detected with the anti-PSA horseradish peroxidase
(HRP)-conjugated antibody and detection protocol from the
Human PSA ELISA Kit (Anogen). For the detection of PAP,
wells were washed and incubated in 90 mmol/L citrate buffer
pH 4.8 with 4 mg/mL p-nitrophenyl-phosphate at 37 C for 30
minutes. The reaction was stopped with 0.5 mol/L sodium
hydroxide, and the absorbance at 405 nm was read using a
Multiskan plate reader (Thermo Electronics). For the detection
of other proteins, wells were incubated with biotinylated
antibodies in PBS with 3% BSA, washed, incubated with
streptavidin HRP (BD Biosciences) in PBS with 3% BSA,
washed, and then developed with the TMB substrate solution
(EMD Chemicals). Development was stopped with 0.5 mol/L
sulfuric acid and the absorbance at 450 nm was measured. The
following biotinylated detection antibodies were used: antiCD81 (clone JS-81 biotinylated with the EZ-Link NHS-PEO
Solid Phase Biotinylation Kit, Pierce/Thermo Scientific), antiMHC class I (clone W6/32; Abnova), and an IgG1 isotype
control (BD Biosciences).
Animal studies
Male BALB/c or C57BL/6 mice aged 6 to 8 weeks old were
obtained from Harlan Sprague Dawley, Inc. Mice were
treated with TBS or MVA-BN-vectors injected s.c. For
tumor studies, 5  105 CT26-PAP or 1  105 E6-PSA cells
were implanted intradermally (i.d.), and tumor size was
measured twice weekly with calipers. Tumor volume was
calculated as (length  width2)/2. Statistical significance
over the course of the measurements was determined by
repeated measure ANOVA (RM-ANOVA) with Bonferroni's
multiple comparison test. Differences in tumor size at a
particular time point were compared by 1-way ANOVA with
Bonferroni's multiple comparison test. All protocols were
approved by the BN ImmunoTherapeutics Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.
Determination of serum antibody titers by ELISA
The 96-well plates were coated with PSA or PAP protein
(Meridian Life Science Inc.) diluted in carbonate buffer or
MVA-BN diluted in PBS, then washed and blocked for 1 hour
with PBS þ 0.05% Tween20. Serial dilutions of mouse sera
were added in duplicates, incubated for 1 hour, washed, and
incubated with HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies
(Southern Biotech). Bound antibodies were detected with
the TMB substrate solution (EMD Chemicals), which was
stopped with 0.5 mol/L sulfuric acid. Absorbance was measured at 450 nm. Titers were calculated as the reciprocal
value of the last dilution with a signal at least 2-fold higher
than background.

Determination of the frequency of IFN-g producing
T cells by ELISPOT
Millipore Multiscreen 96-well filtration plates (Millipore)
were coated with rat anti-mouse IFN-g capture antibody (BD
Biosciences) overnight at 4 C. Subsequently, plates were
washed with PBS, blocked with RPMI-10 media (RPMI þ
10% BCS þ 5  105 mol/L b-Mercaptoethanol; Mediatech),
washed again, and then splenocytes of treated mice were
plated at 5E5 cells per well in RPMI-10. Cells were stimulated
with the indicated reagents for 40 hours at 37 C, washed,
incubated with a biotin-conjugated anti-IFN-g antibody (AbD
Serotec), washed again, and then incubated with StreptavidinAlkaline Phosphatase (BD Biosciences). Plates were washed
and then developed with Vector Blue Substrate (Alkaline
Phosphatase Substrate Kit III, Vector Lab Inc.). Spots were
counted using an ImmunoSpot plate scanner (Cellular Technology Ltd.).

Results
Construction and characterization MVA-BN-PRO
viruses with exosome-targeted transgenes
To target the localization of PSA and PAP to exosomes, 2
new viral vectors were developed that encode fusion proteins
linking the C1C2 domain of mouse lactadherin to the Cterminus of PSA or PAP (Fig. 1A). The expression of the
transgenes encoded by these vectors was characterized using
the mouse colon carcinoma cell line CT26. CT26 cells were
incubated with MVA-BN-PSA-C1C2 or MVA-BN-PAP-C1C2 at
a multiplicity of infection (MOI) ranging from 1 to 100. Whole
cell lysates were prepared 24 hours later for analysis by
Western blotting. On blots probed with an anti-PSA antibody,
a 64-kDa band was detected in MVA-BN-PSA-C1C2 infected
cells consistent with the predicted 66-kDa size of the PSA-C1C2
protein (Fig. 1B). The wild-type PSA protein encoded by MVABN-PAP-C1C2 was detected at the expected size of 30 kDa,
which was similar to the dominant band present in the lane
loaded with purified PSA protein. On blots of the same lysates
probed with an anti-PAP antibody, a 50-kDa band was revealed
in cells infected with MVA-BN-PSA-C1C2, which matched the
size of purified wild-type PAP protein (Fig. 1C). Likewise, an 80kDa band was detected in lysates from cells infected with MVABN-PAP-C1C2, which corresponds to the predicted 79-kDa size
of PAP-C1C2. A faint 50-kDa band was also detected in these
lysates, which may be a cleavage product of the larger PAPC1C2 protein. When cells were infected with either virus at the
highest MOI, a doublet of bands appeared, which may be a
result of cytopathic effects due to the virus being present at a
very high MOI.
Conditioned media from similarly infected cultures was
analyzed for the presence of secreted transgenic proteins
(Supplementary Fig. S1). Low or undetectable amounts of
PSA-C1C2 or PAP-C1C2 were measured, compared with high
amounts of unmodified PSA or PAP. This is consistent with
the expression characteristics of other secreted proteins following linkage to a C1C2 domain (7). Together with the
Western blots, these data indicate that infection of cells by
MVA-BN-PSA-C1C2 or MVA-BN-PAP-C1C2 results in the

and PAP.
Localization of PSA-C1C2 and PAP-C1C2 proteins
To generate large cultures of cells suitable for characterizing protein expression on exosomes, stably transfected
HEK293-F cell lines were generated that expressed protein
from 1 of 4 DNA expression constructs, encoding either wildtype or exosome-targeted PSA or PAP. Expression of the
transgenic proteins in the cell lines was found to be relatively
similar to what was observed with the virally infected CT26
cells (data not shown).
Exosome targeting of PSA-C1C2 and PAP-C1C2 was verified
as previously described (9, 16) using an anti-CD81–based
cross-capture ELISA. In this assay, an antibody against the
tetraspan protein CD81 was used to capture exosomes from
concentrated conditioned media from each of the HEK cell
lines. Subsequently, the presence of PSA or PAP on exosomes
was determined using an anti-PSA antibody or an enzymatic
assay for PAP in the detection steps. A positive PSA-specific
signal was detected in media conditioned by the HEK-PSAC1C2 cell line but not in the media from the HEK-PSA cell line
(Fig. 2A). Likewise, a PAP-specific signal was only detected in
media from the HEK-PAP-C1C2 cell line (Fig. 2B). Aliquots of
these samples were further tested with anti-CD81 (Fig. 2C) and
anti-MHC class I (Fig. 2D) detection antibodies as controls to
verify the amount of exosomes captured in the assay. As
shown in Fig. 2E, lower signals were obtained from the
HEK-PSA-C1C2 sample, which suggests a lower concentration
of exosomes in this preparation. Overall, these experiments
provide evidence that the C1C2-fusion proteins are localized
to exosomes.

MVA-BN-PSA-C1C2 encodes
PSA with a C-terminal fusion to

domain and wild-type PSA. All
transgenes are expressed under
the control of the synthetic early/
late promoter (Ps). B and C, whole

analyzed by Western blot along
with PSA or PAP reference
protein. Blots were probed with (B)
an anti-PSA antibody or (C) an
anti-PAP antibody.

Humoral responses in mice treated with MVA-BN-PRO
vectors encoding wild-type or exosome-targeted PSA
and PAP
To assess whether exosome targeting improved the
humoral response against PSA or PAP, male BALB/c or
C57BL/6 mice were treated with 5E7 TCID50 of the MVABN-PRO viral vectors once every 2 weeks for a total of 3
treatments. Serum was collected 2 weeks after each treatment,
and the titer of anti-PSA IgG, anti-PAP IgG, or anti-MVA IgG
was evaluated in pooled sera from each group by ELISA. As
shown in Fig. 3A, BALB/c mice treated with any of the 3
viruses developed anti-PSA IgG titers with similar kinetics that
reached a titer of 64,000 by day 42. Notably, anti-PSA IgG titers
were undetectable in C57BL/6 mice treated with the viruses
encoding wild-type PSA, whereas low titers did develop in
mice treated with MVA-BN-PSA-C1C2 (Fig. 3B).
The anti-PAP IgG titers induced by treatment with the
viruses encoding wild-type PAP tended to be low in BALB/c
and C57BL/6 mice and required 2 or 3 treatments for detection (Fig. 3C and D). In contrast, anti-PAP IgG titers were 16- to
128-fold higher in BALB/c mice treated with MVA-BN-PAPC1C2. Furthermore, anti-PAP IgG titers were detectable after
only a single dose (day 14). Similar titers were reached even
when mice were treated with 10-fold lower amounts of this
virus (data not shown). An analysis of titers from individual
mice revealed that all BALB/c mice treated with MVA-BNPAP-C1C2 developed anti-PAP IgG titers detectable at the
lowest dilution tested (1:125), compared with only 7 or 10 mice
treated with MVA-BN-PRO or MVA-BN-PSA-C1C2 (Supplementary Fig. S2). In C57BL/6 mice, MVA-BN-PAP-C1C2 treatment also led to higher anti-PAP IgG titers than the other
viruses (Fig. 3D). The anti-MVA IgG titers raised by the 3 viral
vectors were similar between all 3 viruses (Fig. 3E and F),

Exosome Targeting of Tumor Antigens Improves Efficacy

Figure 2. Protein expression on exosomes was analyzed with an anti-CD81 cross-capture ELISA. The HEK-PSA (*), HEK-PSA-C1C2 (*), HEK-PAP (¤), and
HEK-PAP-C1C2 () cell lines were grown for 5 to 7 days in protein-free media, and concentrated media from each cell line was incubated in wells coated with
an anti-CD81 antibody to capture exosomes. Wells were probed with a detection antibody against (A) PSA or (B) PAP-derived enzymatic activity was detected

supporting that the differences detected between groups were
not due to variable virus dosing.
The relative ratio of antibody isotypes produced against an
antigen (IgG2a/IgG1 for BALB/c or IgG2c/IgG1 for C57BL/6
mice) can be used to indicate whether the response is more
biased toward a Th1 response (higher ratio) or a Th2 response
(lower ratio; refs. 17, 18). In BALB/c mice, the ratios for antiPSA and anti-PAP antibody titers were similar among all
groups and were consistent with a Th1 response (data not
shown). In C57BL/6 mice, the antibody titers were also consistent with a Th1 response, but responses generated against
the nonexosome-targeted antigens were so low that ratios
could not be determined (data not shown).
T-cell responses in mice treated with MVA-BN-PRO
vectors encoding wild-type or exosome-targeted PSA
and PAP
To investigate the effects of immunization with exosometargeted antigens on cellular immunity, BALB/c mice were
immunized every 2 weeks for a total of 4 treatments with
MVA-BN-PRO, MVA-BN-PSA-C1C2, or MVA-BN-PAP-C1C2.

www.aacrjournals.org

Five days after the last immunization, the frequency of
PSA, PAP, or MVA-specific T-cell responses in restimulated
splenocytes was enumerated by ELISPOT. As shown in Fig. 4A,
treatment with MVA-BN-PSA-C1C2 induced a 2 to 4-fold
higher frequency of PSA-specific T cells than the other groups.
Furthermore, the frequency of PAP-specific T cells was 4- to 6fold higher in mice treated with MVA-BN-PAP-C1C2 than the
other groups (Fig. 4B). The frequencies of anti-MVA T cells
between each group were at most 40% different from each
other (Fig. 4C), suggesting that the differences seen for PSA
and PAP were specific to exosome targeting of these antigens.
Depletion of CD4 or CD8 T cells prior to restimulation with
PSA or PAP overlapping peptide library (OPL) showed that the
ratio of CD4:CD8 T cells responding to the stimuli was similar
in mice treated with the viruses encoding either exosometargeted or wild-type antigens (data not shown).

greatest suppression of tumor growth occurred in mice treated with MVA-BN-PAP-C1C2 (Fig. 5A–C). This difference was
not only statistically significant against the TBS- or MVA-BN–
treated groups (P < 0.001), but also against the other PRO virus
treatment groups (P < 0.01). Likewise, in an evaluation of

Exosome Targeting of Tumor Antigens Improves Efficacy

treatment group had significantly smaller tumors compared
with both TBS and MVA-BN (Fig. 5B; P < 0.001; ANOVA).
Similar results were obtained in tumor efficacy experiments
using an independently isolated CT26-PAP clone (data not
shown). Treatment with MVA-BN-PRO or MVA-BN-PAP-C1C2
did not reduce tumor growth in CT26-PAP tumor models
when used in a therapeutic setting (data not shown).
In an effort to correlate antitumor efficacy with immune
responses against PAP, the anti-PAP IgG titers and IgG2a/IgG1
isotype ratios were determined from individual mice at the
end of the study (Fig. 5D–G). Mice treated with TBS had
tumor-induced anti-PAP IgG antibody titers with a median
value of 5,000 (Fig. 5D), and a low IgG2a/IgG1 ratio (Fig. 5G,
median ¼ 0.05). Treatment with MVA-BN-PRO or MVA-BNPSA-C1C2 led to a similar anti-PAP IgG antibody titer and a
slightly higher IgG2a/IgG1 ratio (Fig. 5G, median ¼ 0.19 and
0.13, respectively). In contrast, mice treated with MVA-BNPAP-C1C2 had overall higher anti-PAP IgG antibody titers
than those induced by the growing tumor (Fig. 5D, median ¼
64,000). This was mainly due to a considerable increase in antiPAP–specific antibodies of the IgG2a isotype (Fig. 5E,
median ¼ 64,000; P < 0.01) resulting in a much higher
IgG2a/IgG1 ratio as compared with the other groups
(Fig. 5G, median ¼ 2.00; P < 0.01). These results indicate that
growth of the CT26-PAP tumors promoted a Th2-biased
humoral response against PAP as indicated by the relatively
low IgG2a/IgG1 ratio in the mice treated with TBS. However,
previous treatment with MVA-BN-PAP-C1C2 but not MVABN-PRO or MVA-BN-PSA-C1C2, significantly increased the
anti-PAP IgG2a/IgG1 ratio, suggesting that this therapy
induced a stronger and more Th1-biased immune response
against the tumor antigen.
Therapeutic efficacy was also tested in an immunotherapy
setting using the PSA-expressing E6 cell line, and the data
from 2 replicate studies are shown combined in Fig. 6. The
tumors in mice treated with any of the 3 MVA-BN-PRO viruses
grew significantly slower than in mice treated with TBS or
MVA-BN (P < 0.01 or 0.001). Furthermore, a trend of improved
efficacy was seen in the mice treated with MVA-BN-PSA-C1C2.

These mice had the smallest tumor volume at multiple time
points (Fig. 6A and C) and no tumors larger than 350 mm3 on
days 17 or 18 (Fig. 6B). As described before in the PAP tumor
model, anti-PSA IgG titers and IgG2a/IgG1 isotype ratios were
determined in individual mice from each group at the end of
the study (Fig. 6D–G). The growing tumor by itself induced a
Th2-biased anti-PSA immune response with a low IgG2a/IgG1
ratio (Fig. 6G TBS group, median ratio ¼ 0.125). Notably,
treatment with MVA-BN-PSA-C1C2 significantly increased
the anti-PSA IgG2a/IgG1 ratio above that of all other groups
(Fig. 6G, median ¼ 0.5; P < 0.01). Therefore, in the immunotherapeutic setting only treatment with the vector encoding exosome-targeted PSA was capable of shifting the tumor-induced
PSA response toward a Th1 bias. In prevention experiments,
treatment with any of the 3 MVA-BN-PRO viruses provided
similar, strong protection (data not shown).
Overall, these experiments showed that treatment with
MVA-BN-PAP-C1C2 led to the strongest antitumor activity
in a PAP-expressing tumor model. This enhancement correlated with an increased anti-PAP humoral response characterized by a high IgG2a/IgG1 ratio. Moreover, MVA-BN-PSA-C1C2
treatment resulted in a trend of improved antitumor activity
against a PSA-expressing tumor model and also promoted an
anti-PSA humoral response with a high IgG2a/IgG1 ratio.

Discussion
Recently, prostate cancer immunotherapy has made great
progress in the clinic and shows that the immune system can
be utilized to extend patient survival (3, 5, 6). MVA-BN-PRO is
being developed as a next-generation immunotherapeutic
that may provide a higher frequency of protection or more
prolonged survival by encoding 2 TAA, PSA, and PAP. To
further enhance the activity of this vector, we have targeted
PSA or PAP localization to exosomes. Exosome targeting has
been shown to improve the antigenicity of poorly immunogenic proteins (7, 9) and has been explored with DNA vectors
for improving antitumor efficacy with the model antigen OVA
(11). We show here that the immunogenicity of PSA and PAP

can be improved by fusing either protein to the C1C2 domain of
lactadherin. Compared with MVA-BN-PRO, treatment of mice
with MVA-BN-PAP-C1C2 caused a striking improvement in the
immune response against PAP and significantly enhanced
antitumor activity against a PAP-expressing tumor. Similarly,
the immune response against PSA was improved in mice
treated with MVA-BN-PSA-C1C2, and a trend of enhanced
efficacy was also found against a PSA-expressing tumor. The
enhancement of antigenicity was specific to the exosometargeted antigens, whereas the immunogenicity of the other
wild-type transgene in the constructs was unchanged.
Treatment of mice on 2 different genetic backgrounds with
MVA-BN-PAP-C1C2 resulted in dramatically higher, more
rapidly induced antibody titers against PAP than mice treated
with viruses encoding wild-type PAP. Wild-type PAP seems to
be a particularly weak B-cell antigen in mice as compared with
other transgenic antigens expressed by MVA or even with the
use of PAP mixed in Freund's adjuvant (data not shown).
Therefore, it is of particular significance that immunization
with MVA-BN expressing exosome-targeted PAP led to an

improved B-cell response. Exosome targeting also improved
humoral responses against PSA in C57BL/6 mice, which failed
to raise antibodies against PSA when treated with viruses
encoding wild-type PSA. This example shows that targeting a
tumor-associated antigen like PSA for exosome localization
can improve responses in situations where raising a humoral
response is very difficult. This may be relevant for treating selftolerant human patients in whom raising anti-PSA antibodies
is challenging (19).
In these experiments, exosome targeting modulated the
immune responses against PSA and PAP differently. Treatment of mice with constructs encoding exosome-targeted PSA
led to an enhanced cellular response, but the antibody titers
against PSA were only improved in C57BL/6 mice, and the
induced titers were low. Mice treated with constructs encoding exosome-targeted PAP also had an increased cellular
response, but in contrast to PSA, the humoral response against
PAP was dramatically enhanced in BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice.
It is unknown why exosome targeting affected the immune
responses against these 2 antigens differently, but distinct

antigens induce qualitative and quantitative differences in
immune responses. Furthermore, fusion of the 30-kDa C1C2
domain to different proteins could differentially affect a
variety of characteristics predicted to affect immunogenicity.
These include the efficiency of exosome localization, protein
half-life, alterations to protein confirmation caused by the
C1C2 fusion, and levels of proteolytic processing.
Exosome targeting improved antitumor activity in 2 different tumor models. Although the immunologic mechanisms
behind the enhanced antitumor efficacy are currently
unknown, exosome targeting improved both the magnitude
and quality of the immune responses. Mice treated with
viruses encoding exosome-targeted PSA or PAP had an
increased frequency of PSA- or PAP-specific T cells compared
with mice treated with viruses encoding wild-type transgenes.
Furthermore, in the context of tumors that promoted Th2biased immunity against PSA or PAP, only treatment with the
virus encoding the exosome-targeted form of the tumor
antigen shifted immunity toward a Th1-biased response.

Although the most effective treatments induced a Th1-biased
humoral response, no direct correlation was observed
between antibody titers and tumor size when individual mice
were analyzed (data not shown). Further work will be needed
to determine the contribution of different aspects of immunity
toward the enhanced therapeutic activity. However, the characteristics of immune responses provided by vectors encoding
exosome-targeted antigens are desirable for treating prostate
cancer patients.
In summary, this study shows that exosome targeting is a
viable method for improving the immunogenicity and therapeutic efficacy of viral-based immunotherapies and warrants
further investigation of modified PSA and PAP in poxvirus
vectors for the treatment of prostate cancer.
