ABSTRACT
Tumor requires tumor vasculature to supply oxygen and nutrients so as to
support its continued growth, as well as provide a main route for metastatic spread.
In this study, a TF-cascade-targeted strategy aiming to disrupt tumor blood vessels
was developed by combination of TF-targeted HMME-loaded drug delivery system and
PDT. PDT is a promising new modality in the treatment of cancers, which employs the
interaction between a tumor-localizing photosensitizer and light of an appropriate
wavelength to bring about ROS-induced cell death. In vitro results showed that
protein EGFP-EGF1modification could significantly contribute to the uptake of
nanoparticles by TF over-expressed BCECs. In vivo multispectral fluorescent imaging,
the EGFP-EGF1 conjugated nanoparticles showed significantly higher accumulation
in tumor tissues than non-conjugated ones. Tumor tissue slides further presented
that EGFP-EGF1 conjugated nanoparticles showed significantly higher accumulation
in tumor vasculature than non-conjugated ones. In vitro study demonstrated that
PDT increased TF expression of BCECs. In vivo imaging, ex vivo imaging and tumor
tissue slides showed that PDT further contribute EGFP-EGF1-NP accumulation in
tumor. These promising results indicated that PDT enhanced EGFP-EGF1modified
PEG-PLGA nanoparticle accumulation in tumor vaculature. Considering that EGFPEGF1 conjugation enhanced nanoparticles uptake by TF over-expressed endothelium
and PDT increased endothelium TF expression. We conclude that PDT triggered a
TF cascade targeted effect. A combination of both EGFP-EGF1 modification and PDT
provided a positive feed-back target effect to tumor vessels and might have a great
potential for tumor therapy.

INTRODUCTION

Targeting vascular network is therefore an attractive
approach for the treatment of human malignancies [1,
2]. Concentration of therapeutic vascular targeting has
been adopted in anti-angiogenic approaches so far,

Tumor angiogenesis and vasculature is the
pathological basis of their proliferation and metastasis.

which prevents the neovascularization but don’t damage
well-established vessels. Hence selective shutdown of
the established tumor vasculature, maybe a promising
strategy. There are two ways of anti-vasculature therapies
up to date. First, Antibodies, peptides or grow factors
were conjugated with drugs, toxins, photosensitizer,
cytokines or tissue factor, or incorporated into vectors for
gene delivery [3-7]. Second, small molecule vasculature
disrupting agents (VDAs) selectively disrupt tumor
vessels, including combretastatins and drugs related to
5,6-dimethylxanthenone-4-acetic acid (DMXAA) which
are the two main groups of low-weight molecule antivasculature drugs applied in preclinical and clinical trials
[8].
Tissue factor (TF) is aberrantly expressed on the
surface of the tumor vasculature rather than normal
vasculature. TF could served as a potential targeted
molecular for targeting tumor vasculature. In our previous
study, we have successfully established a delivery to TF
over-expressed cells. EGFP-EGF1 fusion protein, derived
from FVII, which contained special FVII binding domain
of TF without procoagulant activity, was conjugated
to PEG-PLA nanoparticles. It has been proven to have
efficient target effect to neovascular and tumor cells of
brain glioma which over expressed TF. However, target
therapy based on antibodies, peptides, grow factors or our
EGFP-EGF1 protein conjugation may miss the precise
location. So target therapy involved PDT which gives
“a second location” appeared with more accurate target
efficacy. It only effects by strictly tumor-focused exposure
to laser light, which may be highly specific because of
largely improving tumor imaging modalities [17, 18]. In
human lung cancer and breast cancer, especially when
breast cancer became chemoresistant, FVII bounding
photosensitizers showed efficient and safe [7, 15, 16]. But
challenges remained. The killing mechanisms depend on
that ROS directly induce cell death. However, it requires
hours between administration of photosensitizer and
radiation, called drug-light interval (DLI), to make drug
distribute in parenchyma cells. The long interval increases
risk of light toxicity. Anti-vasculature PDT which aims
to target tumour vessels rather than its parenchyma may
served as a alternative therapeutic approach.
We established a TF-cascade-targeted strategy
to target tumor vasculature. It was supposed to take
advantage of combination of TF-targeted nanoparticles
and PDT to cascade recruit TF-targeted nanoparticles
to tumor vasculature, eventually disrupting tumor
vasculature. Not only TF-cascade-targeted efficacy was
made in the strategy, but also TF-targeted nanoparticles
would precisely direct the tumor vasculature because
of PDT. TF-targeted nanoparticles can target tumor
vaculature like most target nanoparticles in current
study but the difference is they are almost “silent” after
administration. And it was relied on PDT toactivate. PDT
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

can be accurately conducted on wanted site to activate the
nanoparticles. PDT also provide safety to normal organs
because the nanoparticles in the part without PDT would
be inactivate.
Here we established a TF-cascade-targeted drug
delivery system——EGFP-EGF1-NP loaded HMME
(ENP-HMME) for tumor therapy. EGFP-EGF1 served
as the targeting molecular. We hypothesized that ROS
was intentionally produced during PDT and caused
vascular endothelial injury, inducing TF expression on
the endothelium of tumor vasculature. Then ENP-HMME
gathered more in tumor blood vessels over-expressing TF,
because of the ability of targeting TF. During the process
of PDT, TF further released , which recruit more TFtargeted ENP-HMME. Targeting property of fluorescencelabeled ENP and the forming ability of TF by BCECs were
investigated both in vitro and in vivo and compared with
those of unmodified NP-HMME.

RESULTS
Characterization of nanoparticles
As depicted in Figure 1, TEM observation showed
that the NP-HMME AND ENP-HMME were consistent
with the size and of uniform shape. NPs and ENPs
loaded HMME which were labeled or unlabeled with
coumarin-6 or Dir are all between 100nm and 120nm
with a narrow size distribution (polydispersity index, PdI
< 0.2). The HMME loaded NPs had an average diameter
of about 103.2 nm and the diameter was increased to
approximately 116.4 nm after EGFP-EGF1 conjugation.
After coumarin-6 or Dir encapsulation, EGFP-EGF1NP had an average diameter of 117.9 nm and 118.2nm,
respectively. There was no significant difference in particle
size between EGFP-EGF1-conjugated nanoparticles and
non-conjugated ones and between loaded coumarin-6/
Dir and its non-loaded counterpart. Concentrations of
HMME (wave length 395nm), coumarin-6 or Dir (wave
length 750nm) in nanoparticles were determined based
on their respective absorbance spectra in acetonitrile. No
differences were observed in drug entrapment efficiency
between EGFP-EGF1 conjugated nanoparticles and nonconjugated counterparts (HMME 4.24 ±0.016 versus 3.75
± 0.021, Dir 1.63 ± 0.008 versus 1.66 ± 0.005, Coumarin-6
0.270 ± 0.011 versus 0.275 ± 0.003, mg/g).

Uptake characteristic of ENPs by TF overexpressed BCECs
To investigate the uptake of nanoparticles, BCECs
co-incubated with TNF-α to induce TF expression.
Figure 2 showed that TF expression of BCECs raises to

more than 2 folds of non-stimulated ones. Coumarin-6
(green) was encapsuled as a fluorescence indicator to
track nanoparticles. TNF-α stimulated BCECs incubated
with coumarin-6-labeled ENP revealed significantly
higher fluorescence intensity than that incubated
with coumarin-6-labeled NP after incubation for 3h
(Figure 3B, 3C). An intense green fluorescent signal
was found both in cytoplasm and nucleus. However
nanoparticles entered cytoplasm more. Flowcytometry
also demonstrated uptake of ENP was more prominent,
consistent with the qualitative analyses (Figure 4). These
data indicated that protein EGFP-EGF1 conjugation to the
nanoparticles could significantly contribute to the uptake
of nanoparticles by BCECs over-expressing TF, as EGFPEGF1 on the surface of nanoparticles could specifically
recognize TF.

The TF expression of BCECs post-PDT with various
HMME formulations were also investigated both at the
level of transcription and post-transcription. At 2-hour
post-PDT, we observed that both single radiation and PDT
increased TF expression at transcription level in BCECs
(Figure 6C). At the same time, ENP-HMME showed
stronger enhancement of inducing TF expression than
NP-HMME post-PDT (Figure 6). Similarly, ENP plus
PDT group revealed higher TF expression than NP plus
PDT group at post-transcription level (Figure 6B). We also
measured ROS levels in BCECs. Dihydroethidium (DHE),
one of the most common probes used for superoxide
compound anionic fluorescent detection was utilized.
As shown in Figure 5, almost no ROS was detected

without any treatment (Figure 5A). Red fluorescent signal
increased after single radiation was delivered (Figure
5B), but also weak. Significant increase of red fluorescent
signal was observed when nanoparticles loaded HMME
were added, and remarkablely more ROS was detected in
ENP plus PDT group than NP plus PDT group (Figure
5C , 5D). The results demonstrated that PDT induce TF
expression of BCECs and conjugation to the surface of
nanoparticles significantly increased the TF expression
of BCECs post-PDT. Further more, TF expression was
consistent with the ROS production, which might suggest
more ROS lead to higher TF expression within limits.

in in vivo study, because it tracks nanoparticles in living
animals via a non-invasive approach. The fluorescence
intensity in the tumor of ENP group was significantly
higher compared with NP group at any time point ranged
from 2 h to 24 h post administration (Figure 7A and 7B).
After PDT was delivered, the fluorescence intensity in
tumor tissues of the ENP plus PDT group was higher,
while the NP plus PDT group showed no significant
difference compared to that without PDT groups (Figure
7). The ex-vivo organ imaging also revealed that the
accumulation of ENP group in tumor tissues was 2.45-fold
higher than that of NP (Figure 8A, 8B). The difference
increased to 3.5-fold after PDT was delivered (Figure
8C, 8D). This results further proved that the modification
of nanoparticles with EGFP-EGF1 could target TF and
therefore improve the nanoparticles in tumor tissues.
Further more, PDT further promoted the accumulation of
EGFP-EGF1 modified nanoparticles in tumor tissues of
tumor- bearing mice.

Targeted biodistribution of nanoparticles and TF
expression of tumor vasculature endothelium in
tumor-bearing mice post-PDT in ex vivo

expression in the vessels of tumor was observed after PDT
in both NP plus PDT group and ENP plus PDT group, and
the ENP plus PDT group increased more obviously (Figure
10C, 10D). Figure 9 showed that reactive oxygen species
detected in tumor tissue were weak and no singnificant
difference was observed between control group and
single radiation group (Figure A and B). ROS increased
prominently after PDT was delivered, and ENP plus PDT
group was higher than NP plus PDT group. This results
showed that EGFP-EGF1 conjugation contributed to
nanoparticles accumulation in tumor vessels. While PDT
increased TF expression which might account for ROS.

To investigate the distribution of NPs in tumor ex
vivo, nanoparticles labeled by coumarin-6 were used as
a fluorescent marker at the same time. The tumor were
harvested for frozen insections and stained with rabbit
anti-rat TF polyclonal antibody and CY3 labeled goat antirabbit IgG for observation under confocal microscopy.
Frozen insections observation showed the nanoparticles
sited in blood vessels more than the other part of local
tumor tissues (Figure 10). The biodistribution trend among
groups were consistent with in vivo fluorescence imaging
(Figure 10). TF expressed in the vessels of tumor in both
NP group and ENP group, showing equal expression
before PDT delivered (Figure 10A, 10B). Increasing TF

DISCUSSION
The vascular endothelium of tumour tissue
differs from that of normal tissues in several ways [20],
which makes it a potential target for anticancer therapy.

Though preexisting abnormal tumor vasculature is more
susceptible to the small molecule VDAs according to
the differences between normal and tumor endothelium,
normal vascular endothelium also seems to be damaged.
For example, a cardiovascular toxicity profile was
observed in clinical studies [21]. EGFP-EGF1-PEGPLGA nanoparticles is an established and safe delivery in
our previous study. It improves dose-related side-effects
[23, 24], meanwhile it provides solutions for solubility
problems of poorly soluble drugs and controlled release
drug formulations [22]. In this study, EGFP-EGF1 protein
was thiolated and conjugated to the malemide covering the
PEGylated nanoparticles. Thus formed EGFP-EGF1-NP
showed more efficient uptake by abnormal TF expression
endothelial cells than NP. This was probably attributed
to that EGFP-EGF1 on the surface of nanoparticles
which could specifically bind TF. The evidences were
as follows. First, BCECs stimulated by TNF-α showed
more efficient uptake than unstimulated ones (Figure

3, 4). In view of increasing expression TF of BCECs
stimulated by TNF-α (Figure 2), more efficient uptake
may because of the combination of EGFP-EGF1 and
TF. Second, as shown in Figure 7, ENP group showed
remarkably higher accumulation in locally abnormal TF
expression tumor than NP group after i.v. administration
of nanoparticles. The later sections showed the similar
results that tumor vascular endothelium with abnormal TF
expression revealed higher accumulation of nanoparticles
in ENP group compared with NP group. Furthermore,
equal nanoparticles accumulation of tumor vessels was
observed between NP group and NP plus PDT group,
even though NP group showed higher TF expression of
tumor vessels. This result suggest EGFP-EGF1would be a
functional protein directing to TF and therefore delivering
anti-tumor drugs to tumor vessels. PLGA is one of the
most successfully used biodegradable polymers. The
US FDA and European Medicine Agency (EMA) have
approved it for various drug delivery systems in humans

[25]. PEG conjugation improves pharmacokinetics and
pharmacodynamics of proteins by increasing protein
solubility and stability and also reducing protein
immunogenicity and uptake by the reticuloendothelial
(RES) system [26, 27]. Since the particle size is an
important trait of particles, the size is generally less
than 200 nm in diameter for pharmaceutical application.
In this study, nanoparticles loaded HMME whether

conjugated with EGFP-EGF1 or not were no more than
120 nm (Table 1), which is believed to be favorable to
drug carrier. Further, the poor water solubility and low
specificity of PSs limited their applications. Therefore
various deliveries, such as biodegradable polymeric
nanoparticles, ceramic-based (i.e. made of silica) and
metallic-based nanoparticles, have been developed to PSs

functionally attached targeting groups, which will deliver
the nanoparticles to cancer cells, to vascular compartments
or to cellular sites expressing appropriate receptors.
In particular, biodegradable PEG-PLGA nanoparticles
have been more fully exploited for the application of
drug carrier because they enhance the drug solubility by
incorporating water-insoluble PSs into their hydrophobic
cores [30].

The study for the first time shows a TF-cascadetargeted therapy strategy for anti-vasculature by TF
specific PEG-PLGA nanoparticle loaded HMME
combining with PDT. PDT is a well-established, clinically
approved, minimally invasive approach. It bases on photochemistry reaction involving the administration of a
photosensitizers (PSs) which produces cytotoxic species
under light irradiation and in the presence of oxygen. It has

been applied to multiple chorioretinal disorders including
age-related macular degeneration, choroidal hemangiomas
and central serous chorioretinopathy [31, 32]. It has been
approved by FDA for treating cancers like esophageal
cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, and skin cancers.
It also showed promising results in treating metastasis
and local recurrence in clinic trials [33]. Clearance
of microorganisms from blood is also investigated
and expanded to microorganisms associated diseases,
including HPV associated cervical intraepithelial neoplasia
[34]. PDT causes tumor ablation via direct cytotoxicity,
anti-vasculature and activating immune system. Classic
PDT depends on direct cytotoxicity and was applied
to tumor therapy. Compared with its long DLI, novel
anti-vasculature PDT provides relatively short DLI—
usually around 15 minutes and has achieved promising
results in clinic trials for cancer [35, 36]. Actually, antivasculature PDT has been used for AMD clinically and
showed promising results. As more tumor endothelial
markers have been identified, target PDT was investigated
to overcome non-specificity and hydrophobicity of PSs.
Current target PDT strategy focused on targeting molecule
conjugation with PSs and deliver systems encapsulated
PSs. It aimed to target only endothelial cells or target both
endothelial cells and tumor cells [7]. In such strategy,
PDT is just a trigger for PSs, but in our strategy it’s also
a trigger for TF cascade. Figure 7 demonstrated that ENP
was accumulated obviously higher in tumor after PDT was
conducted at time point ranging from 2h to 24h. Figure
8 revealed the same trend quantificationally. Figure
10 showed that after PDT, ENP accumulation in tumor
vessels increased significantly. These results suggested
that PDT combination with TF specific nanoparticles may
have amplified ability to recruit nanoparticles than single
TF specific nanoparticles.
It’s well known cytotoxic ROS were the
predominant effector molecules generated during PDT.
And ROS is important in pathway of inducing TF
expression. In the study, it’s observed that PDT increased
TF expression. Figure 10 provided evidence that both NP
plus PDT group and ENP plus PDT group showed higher
TF expression in tumor vasculature compared with those
corresponding groups without PDT delivering. Figure 6
also demonstrated that BCECs expressed higher TF at both
transcription and post-transcription level post-PDT. The
comprehensive results showed that PDT combination may
improve targeting ability of ENP and this enhancing effect
may attributed to increasing TF expression of endothelial
cells post-PDT. Considering that EGFP-EGF1conjugation
contributed to uptake by TF over-expressed endothelium,
positive feedback-cascade target strategy was shown——
existing available TF to attract ENP-HMME, enhance
TF expression via PDT damage, then attract more ENPHMME, thus a positive feedback. What’s more, this
strategy has precise location efficacy and obviously
improves the security. HMME as a new porphyrin-related
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

photosensitizer, has a simpler composition, stronger
photoactivity and shorter-term skin toxicity compared with
old-generation PSs, such as hematoporphyrin derivatives
[37, 38]. They are non-toxic and activated by PDT, and
cytotoxic ROS which damage tumor lesions generate. In
normal tissue environment, HMME is non-toxic without
ROS. However, it release ROS in the diseased area through
irradiation activation. Additionally, ROS are restricted to
short diffusion distance (10-300 nm according to different
estimates) at photosensitizer accumulation site, and have
extremely short life time [39, 40]. As imaging technology
developes, PDT can highly selectively target the tissues by
precise radiation delivery. Two-photon excited PDT has
developed to pin-point small volumes at the laser focus,
while conventional one-photon PDT excited by visible
light can only penetrate relatively superficial lesions.
Compounds conjugated porphyrin dimmers based on
porphyrin which has been studied for two-photon excited
PDT has offer exciting outcomes. Two-photon excited
PDT require near-infrared spectrum which is capable of
travelling more deeply through lesions than visible light,
but also the nonlinear process restricts absorption to
the laser focus. Thus greater treatment depths and more
highly-precise targeting efficacy may be achieved by twophoton PDT.
So far, many markers have been recognized as
targets for tumor vaculature. However, the markers also
express on the normal cells. The conventional target
therapy which relies on molecule affinity can not achieve
truly specific target effect. Non-specific distribution of PSs
also limited PDT application. A combination with target
delivery with PDT provided an better choice. Moreover, in
our strategy, EGFP-EGF1 was used as targeting molecule
to TF and PDT triggered TF cascade, which produced a
specific tumor blood vessels drug delivery system.
In this study, a TF-cascade-targeted strategy for
tumor treatment was developed by combination of TFtargeted HMME-loaded drug delivery system and PDT.
It can precisely locate at tumor blood vessels, which
depends on TF-targeted HMME-loaded nanoparticles to
provide primary localization and then PDT to pinpoint
local tumor site to initiate the nanoparticles. In Vitro
study showed that protein EGFP-EGF1 conjugation to
the nanoparticles could significantly contribute to the
uptake of nanoparticles by TF over-expressed BCECs as
EGFP-EGF1 on the surface of nanoparticles has affinity
to TF. As in vivo multispectral fluorescent imaging
shown, the EGFP-EGF1-NP showed significantly higher
accumulation in tumor tissues than NP. Further more,
when EGFP-EGF1-NP-HMME was combined with PDT,
higher accumulation in tumor blood vessels was observed.
The data indicated EGFP-EGF1-NP-HMME has potential
to cascade-target tumor vessels by combining with PDT,
while have anti tumor vasculature potential.

Characterization of nanoparticles
The morphology of the nanoparticles were
examined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM,
Hitachi, Japan) after negative staining with 1% sodium
phosphotungstate solution. A Zeta Potential/Particle Sizer
NICOMP™380 ZLS (Pss. nicomp particle size system,
USA) measured the mean diameter of the nanoparticles
by dynamic light scattering (DLS) with He-Ne laser at
632.8 nm. Concentrations of HMME and coumarin-6
were determined based on their absorbance spectra in
acetonitrile using established standard curve line. The Dir
concentrations were measured by UV spectrophotometry
at a wavelength of 700 nm. Drug loading capacity (DLC)
was determined based on the ratio of final drug weight to
overall weight of the nanoparticles.

In vitro uptake of nanoparticles
BCECs were obtained from the brain of SD rat
via being minced into small pieces and then digested by
collagenase, following by gradiently centrifuging using
percoll, according to previously described techniques.
When it came to the 3rd passage, BCECs were seeded
onto sterile coverslips in 6-well plates and incubated
with tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) of 100ng/mL, after
which the western blotting technique and real-time PCR
were conducted to examine TF expression as previously
described.
BCECs were co-incubated with TNF-α and
coumarin-6 labeled NP-HMME,ENP-HMME (50ng/ml
of coumarin-6) relatively for 3 hours for the examination
of intracellular uptake. Then cells were washed. After that,
BCECs were observed under fluorescence microscope for
qualitative analysis. For quantitative analysis of uptake
efficiency,BCECs were stained with DAPI and digested
for flowcytometry.

Cell culture and animals
Human Burkitt lymphoma cell lines, CA46 were
obtained from American Type Culture Collection and cells
were maintained in RPMI-1640 supplemented with 10%
fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin.
Spraguee Dawley rats (50~60g) were provided by
the Center of Experimental Animals of Tongji Medical
College (Wuhan, China). NOD/SCID mice were provided
by HFK Bioscience CO. LTD (Beijing, China). The
protocols for treating the animals in the experiment were
evaluated and approved by the ethical committee of Tongji
Medical College.

In-vitro quantification of TF expression of BCECs
post-PDT
1x106 BCECs grown overnight were incubated
with NP-HMME and ENP-HMME (50ng/ml) for 3 hours.

Biodistribution of nanoparticles and TF
expression of tumor vasculature endothelium in
tumor-bearing mice post-PDT

Before PDT, nanoparticles-containing medium was
replaced with fresh medium. Then PDT was conducted
on BCECs by irradiating with cold light source. Cells
were then washed and incubated with DHE for 30min at
37 oC for observing intracellular ROS under fluorescence
microscope.
To investigate the expression level of TF by BCECs
post-PDT, cells were incubated with NP-HMME and
ENP-HMME (50ng/ml) for 3 hours and then PDT was
conducted. At 2 hours post-PDT, cells were washed, lysed
with RIPA and assessed for TF expression by western
blotting and real-time PCR.

Nanoparticles loaded HMME were labeled by
coumarin-6 (dose 80 ug/kg, reconstitution in phosphate
buffer saline) for observing nanoparticles distribution
and TF expression. Animals were killed at 24h postPDT. Tumors were collected for frozen sections of 5 um
thickness and stained with rabbit polyclonal to tissue
factor. And then sections were observed under confocal
microscopy to investigate nanoparticles distribution and
TF expression of blood vessel. Tumors were excised right
to analyze ROS by incubation with probe DHE for 30
minutes at 37oC. Fluorescence slides were observed under
a confocal microscope .

Mouse model and In vivo PDT
Mice were inoculated with intradermal injection of
1x107 CA46 cells over the depilated right shoulder of Nod/
SCID mice (4-5 weeks old). PDT was conducted when
tumors reached a diameter of 5 to 7 mm (28 days after
inoculation).
Tweenty mice were divided into five groups at
random. Phosphate buffer saline (2 ml/kg), ENP-HMME
administration (dose 4 mg/kg, reconstitution in phosphate
buffer saline), NP-HMME administration (dose 4 mg/kg,
reconstitution in phosphate buffer saline), ENP-HMME
administration (dose 4 mg/kg, reconstitution in phosphate
buffer saline) plus PDT, NP-HMME administration (dose
4 mg/kg, reconstitution in phosphate buffer saline) plus
PDT. Phosphate buffer saline and nanoparticles were
injected into the tail veins right after model accomplished.
PDT delivery was 10 minutes after intravenous injection.
The fiber optic bundle of a cold light source (KL 1500
LCD, SCHOTT, Germany) with a 4.5 mm aperture was
positioned directly above tumors of mice lying on the left
side. PDT was delivered for constant 15 minutes when
mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of 5%
chloral hydrate.

No potential conflicts of interest were disclosed.

GRANT SUPPORT

Nanoparticles loaded HMME were labeled by Dir
(dose 0.8 mg/kg, reconstitution in physphate buffer saline)
for investigation of pharmacokinetics study in tumorbearing mice. At various points (2h, 6h, 12h, 24h) postPDT, fluorescent scans were conducted on anesthetized
mice using Kodak In-vivo Multispectral Imaging system
(Carestream Health, USA). Mice were euthanized and
main organs were harvested at 24h post-PDT. Each organ
was washed with PBS and then Maestro 2 In Vivo Imaging
System (CRI, USA) was used for capturing fluorescence
images. The wavelength was 780 nm with a deep red filter.

This work was supported a grant from the National
Natural Sciences Foundation of China (No.81302043).
