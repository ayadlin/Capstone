Abstract
Enhanced glucose and lipid metabolism is one of the most
common properties of malignant cells. ATP citrate lyase
(ACLY) is a key enzyme of de novo fatty acid synthesis responsible for generating cytosolic acetyl-CoA and oxaloacetate. To evaluate its role in lung cancer progression, we here
analyzed ACLY expression in a subset of human lung adenocarcinoma cell lines and showed a relationship with the
phosphatidyl-inositol-3 kinase–Akt pathway. The introduction
of constitutively active Akt into cells enhanced the phosphorylation of ACLY, whereas dominant-negative Akt caused
attenuation. In human lung adenocarcinoma samples,
ACLY activity was found to be significantly higher than in
normal lung tissue. Immunohistochemical analysis further
showed phosphorylated ACLY overexpression in 162 tumors,
well-correlating with stage, differentiation grade, and a
poorer prognosis. Finally, to show the therapeutic potential
and mechanism of ACLY inhibition for lung cancer treatment, we assessed the effect of RNA interference targeting
ACLY on lipogenesis and cell proliferation in A549 cells.
ACLY inhibition resulted in growth arrest in vitro and in vivo.
Interestingly, increased intracellular lipids were found in
ACLY knockdown cells, whereas de novo lipogenesis was
inhibited. Supplementation of insulin could rescue the
proliferative arrest elicited by ACLY inhibition; however,
in contrast, fatty acid palmitate induced cell death. Taken
together, these findings suggest that ACLY is involved in
lung cancer pathogenesis associated with metabolic abnormality and might offer a novel therapeutic target. [Cancer Res
2008;68(20):8547–54]

Introduction
One of the most common properties of cancer cells is a
metabolic change into high glycolysis and lipogenesis to satisfy the
increased demand for energy and macromolecules need for autonomous growth. It is assumed that phosphatidyl-inositol-3 kinase
(PI3K)-Akt signaling pathway plays a part in this phenomenon, and
constitutive activation of this pathway is frequently observed in
many types of cancers. Proto-oncogene Akt, downstream from
PI3K, exhibits oncogenic effects with influence on proliferation,

survival, motility, and morphology. Akt also plays a pivotal role of
cancer metabolism via the stimulation of nutrient uptake, glycolysis, and fatty acid biosynthesis through action on glucose
transporters, glycolytic enzymes, and lipogenic enzymes (1–3).
Accumulating evidence indicates that dysregulated glycolysis
and lipid synthesis contribute to cancer pathogenesis. Fluorodeoxyglucose- or 11C-acetate–positron emission tomography imaging
based on the metabolic difference between normal and neoplastic
tissue is useful in cancer detection (4, 5). Thus, glucose and lipid
metabolism–targeting therapeutics have attracted great attention
(6–8). Inhibitors of hexokinase have been shown to reduce ATP
concentrations leading to cytotoxicity in tumor cells (9). Also,
inhibitors of lipid synthesis such as statins, farnesyl transferase
inhibitors, and fatty acid synthase (FASN) inhibitors impair
proliferation or induce apoptosis of tumor cells (7, 10).
ATP citrate lyase (ACLY) is a key enzyme of de novo fatty acid
synthesis. ACLY is involved in the generation of cytosolic acetylCoA and oxaloacetate from citrate and, thus, contributes to the
translocation of acetyl-CoA from mitochondria to cytosol. It has
been found that Akt directly phosphorylates and activates ACLY
(11). More recently, it has been reported that chemical inhibitors
or ACLY RNAi suppress tumor cell growth (12, 13). Because ACLY
functions depend on glucose utility and its product acetyl-CoA is a
building block for cholesterol and fatty acid synthesis, ACLY must
play a crucial role in cancer cell metabolism.
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in the
worldwide and is a typical tumor displaying a high rate of glycolysis
and fatty acid synthesis. Thus, targeting dysregulated metabolism
may be an attractive strategy for lung cancer treatment.
In this study, we therefore examined the contribution of ACLY
to lung cancer pathogenesis and its therapeutic potential. Overexpression and activation of ACLY in patients with lung adenocarcinoma could be shown, and it was found to be a statistically
significant negative prognostic factor. Selective ACLY inhibition
resulted in the inhibition of tumor cell growth in vitro and in vivo.
Growth arrest induced by ACLY inhibition was associated with
intracellular lipid accumulation, despite of the inhibition of de novo
lipogenesis. Our findings suggest that ACLY plays a critical role
in cancer progression and metabolic changes, and may be a
promising therapeutic target in lung cancer.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture and clinical samples. The human lung adenocarcinoma
cell lines A549, NCI-H460, NCI-H23, NCI-H522, HOP62, COR-L105, and PC14
were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and grown in
RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (both medium and
serum from Life Technologies Bethesda Research Laboratories) and 1%
penicillin/streptomycin in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37jC.

Cancer Research
We also analyzed lung cancer tissue from operable patients that had
developed lung adenocarcinoma. All tumors were pathologically diagnosed
based on the WHO classification of lung tumors (14) and staged according
to the classification of the Union Internationale Contre le Cancer. Data for
clinicopathologic variables and patient prognosis were also obtained. All
experiments were performed using a protocol approved by the Institutional
Review Board of the Japanese Foundation for Cancer Research (#2007-1058).
Transient transfections. Constitutively active myristolated Akt and the
dominant-negative Akt plasmids were generous gifts from Dr. Yukiko Gotoh
(Institute of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences, University of Tokyo, Japan).
Cells were plated at 7  105 per well in 60-mm dishes and transfected in
triplicate using the FuGENE 6 Transfection Reagent according to the
manufacturers protocol (Roche Diagnostics, Inc.). Experiments were
repeated at least thrice.
RNA preparation and reverse transcription-PCR. The cell lines in
logarithmic phase of growth and the frozen tissue samples were collected
for RNA extraction, using an RNeasy kit (Qiagen) and total RNA was applied
for first-strand cDNA synthesis with a high-capacity cDNA Reverse
Transcriptase kit (Applied Biosystems). Gene-specific probes and primer
were obtained from Universal ProbeLibrary (Roche Applied Science) and
primer sequences were as follows: 5¶-gaagggagtgaccatcatcg-3¶ (ACLY
forward); 5¶-ttaaagcacccaggcttgat-3¶ (ACLY reverse); 5¶-gctcctccatcaatgacaaaa-3¶ (SREBP-1 forward); 5¶-tgcgcaagacagcagattta-3¶ (SREBP-1 reverse).
PCR was carried out in 96-well plates using the LightCycler 480 System
(Roche Applied Science). All reactions were performed at least in triplicate. The relative amounts of all mRNAs were calculated using the
comparative computed tomography method after normalization to human
h-2-microglobulin (B2M) for human samples. Semiquantitative reverse
transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) was carried out using SYBR Green for the cell
lines. h-actin was used as an internal control.
Cell lysis and immunoblotting. To obtain total protein lysates, frozen
tissue and cells were homogenized and dissolved in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer [150 mmol/L NaCl, 1.0% Igepal CA-630, 0.5% sodium
deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 50 mmol/L Tris (pH 8.0); Sigma] containing
proteinase inhibitors and phosphatase inhibitors. The protein concentration of each lysate was determined using a protein assay reagent kit (BioRad). The total cell lysate was applied on 10% SDS-PAGE. After
electrophoresis, the proteins were transferred electrophoretically from the
gel to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore). The membranes
were then blocked for 1 h in blocking buffer (5% low-fat dried milk in TBS)
and probed with the primary antibodies overnight. After being washed, the
protein content was made visible with horseradish peroxidase–conjugated
secondary antibodies followed by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham). The primary antibodies used were raised against phosphorylated
ACLY (Ser 454), total ACLY, phosphorylated Akt (Ser 473), total Akt,
phosphorylated Erk1/2 (Thr 202/Tyr 204), PTEN (all obtained from Cell
Signaling Technology), SREBP-1 (BD Bioscience), and h-actin (Sigma).
LY294002 and wortmannin were purchased from Sigma.
ACLY activity. ACLY activity was measured via the malate dehydrogenase–coupled method (15). Total protein lysates extracted from cell lines or
clinical samples were subjected to the assay. Change in absorbance in the
absence of exogenous ATP was subtracted from change in the presence of
ATP and was normalized to protein concentration to determine the specific
ACLY activity.
RNA interference. siRNA oligonucleotides for ACLY and a negative
control were purchased from Invitrogen. Three independent oligonucleotides were used for ACLY siRNA. The ACLY siRNA#1 sequence was 5¶UUCUUGAUCAGCUUUCUCGUGAGGG-3¶. The others were designed to
correspond to a previous report (13). Transfection was performed using
Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. Briefly, 60 pmol of siRNA and 10 AL of Lipofectamine RNAiMAX
were mixed in 1 mL of Opti-MEM medium (10 nmol/L final siRNA
concentration). After 20 min of incubation, the mixture was added to the
suspended cells and these were plated on dishes for each assay. Seventy-two
hours after transfection, cells were analyzed for all experiments.
Flow cytometry. For determination of the cell cycle distribution after
siRNA treatment, DNA content was measured by flow cytometry with

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (20). October 15, 2008

propidium iodide (PI). Briefly, 72 h after siRNA treatment on 60-mm dishes,
the cells were harvested and cell pellets were then fixed with 70% ethanol.
Cells were incubated with 20 Ag/mL RNase A at 37jC for 30 min and then
stained with 10 Ag/mL PI. The cell cycle distribution was acquired with a
FACScalibur (Becton Dickinson), and the percentage of cells in each phase
of the cell cycle was analyzed with ModFit software.
Assessment of cell proliferation and cell death. Cells (5  104 cells
per mL) were transfected with siRNA and placed in a 96-well culture plate
on day 0. On day 2, vehicle or 20 Ag/mL insulin (Life Technologies Bethesda
Research Laboratories) or 100 Amol/L palmitate (Sigma) was added to the
medium. On day 3, cell proliferation, as measured as the number of viable
cells, was evaluated at 450 nm absorbance using Cell Count reagent SF
(Nacalai Tesque). The cell death rate (% of total population) was also
determined by trypan blue exclusion assay. Palmitate-bovine serum
albumin (BSA) complex was prepared according to the previous report (16).
Lipid synthesis. A549 cells were transfected with siRNA and were plated
onto 60-mm dishes. After culturing for 72 h, the cells were incubated in
the medium containing 4 ACi/mL D-[6-14C]glucose (GE Healthcare) for
4 h. Cellular lipids were extracted by a Bligh Dyer method (17). The rate
of conversion of glucose into lipid was evaluated as described (12). Assay
was performed in triplicate, and the results were expressed as percentage
change in cpm per mg protein.
Immunohistochemistry, immunocytochemistry, and lipid staining.
Tissue microarrays (TMA) consisting of 162 cases of lung adenocarcinoma
were constructed for immunohistochemistry (IHC). IHC was performed on
5-Am thick, formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections using primary
antibodies for p-ACLY (Ser 454) and p-AKT (Ser 473; purchased from Cell
Signaling Technology). Antigen retrieval was performed for 30 min in citrate
buffer for each antibody. The slides were developed using the labeled
streptavidin biotinylated peroxidase method (Nichirei) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. For p-Akt immunostaining, the Tyramide
Signal Amplication System (CSA II; DakoCytomation) was used. 3,3¶Diaminobenzidine tetrahydro-chloride was used as the chromogen and
hematoxylin as the counterstain. All immunohistochemical staining was
accomplished with a Dako Autostainer (DakoCytomation) under the same
conditions. The expression and staining intensity on TMAs were scored
semiquantitatively without knowledge of patient identity or outcome: 0, no;
1, weak; 2, moderate; 3, moderate to strong; 4, strong and scores were
averaged across three cores. Patients were classified into two groups:
p-ACLY-low (score 0–2) and p-ACLY-high (score 3,4). p-Akt expression was
also divided into two groups according to the ACLY classification.
For immunocytochemistry, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde 72 h after transfection. After PBS washing and treatment with 0.2%
Triton X-100, the cells were blocked using Protein Block (DakoCytomation)
for 10 min at room temperature and then incubated with p-ACLY (Cell
Signaling Technology) or total ACLY (C-20 and G-17; Santa Cruz) antibodies
4jC overnight. Cells were washed and then incubated with FITC-conjugated
secondary antibodies (DakoCytomation) for 1 h at room temperature.
Cells were washed in PBS, mounted, counterstained with 4¶,6-diamidino2-phenylindole dihydrochloride, and visualized with the fluorescence
microscope (Olympus).
Intracellular lipid accumulation was detected by oil red O (Sigma) or
HCS LipidTOX phospholipidosis and steatosis detection kit (Invitrogen)
according to the manufacture’s protocol.
In vivo siRNA treatment of xenograft. Nude mice were inoculated with
1  106 A549 cells. The negative control or ACLY siRNA#1 (5 Amol/L) with
0.05% atelocollagen (Koken) in a 200-AL volume was injected s.c. around
the tumor, according to the manufacture’s instruction. Injection was
performed at weekly intervals for 5 wk. Each experimental condition
included 10 animals per group. Tumor dimensions and body weight were
measured weekly and the tumor volumes calculated using the formula:
1/2 a b2 , where a and b represent the larger and smaller tumor diameters,
respectively. At the end of the experiment, tumors were excised for histologic analysis.
Tumor samples were fixed in 20% formaldehyde-PBS( ) and embedded
in paraffin for H&E staining and IHC. IHC was performed for expression of
p-ACLY and Ki-67, a proliferation marker (DakoCytomation).

Statistical analysis. For in vitro experiments, statistical analysis was
performed using Student’s t tests. An exponential regression model was
used for evaluation of in vivo experiment. Kaplan-Meier survival curves
were constructed for patients with p-ACLY–low and p-ACLY–high expression, and differences between survival curves were tested by a multivariate
Cox regression model. Fisher’s exact tests for contingency tables were used
in Table 1. For all analyses, P value of <0.05 was considered statistically

regulation, we assessed ACLY expression as well as a transcriptional
factor SREBP-1 expression at both mRNA and protein levels in
various human lung adenocarcinoma cell lines. ACLY was
expressed in all cell lines, protein levels closely paralleling mRNA
expression (Fig. 1A and B). SREBP-1 is a member of the basic helixloop-helix-leucine zipper family of transcriptional factors that play
a central role in the expression of lipogenic enzymes. However, our
data showed the inverse relationship between ACLY and SREBP-1
mRNA levels (Fig. 1A). Moreover, total ACLY protein levels were
independent of either the 125 kDa precursor form of SREBP-1 or
the 60 to 70 kDa mature, cleaved form (Fig. 1B). These findings thus
suggested that ACLY protein expression is regulated at the
transcription level, however by an as yet unknown transcription
factor other than SREBP-1.
Notably, phosphorylated ACLY levels were likely to follow total
ACLY levels, suggesting ACLY phosphorylation contributes to its
protein stabilization. Furthermore, the increase in ACLY phosphorylation status seemed to follow p-Akt levels in most cell lines
(Fig. 1B). These findings suggest Akt contributes to stabilize ACLY
protein by means of its phosphorylation. In addition, p-Erk1/2, a
mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), levels were not correlated with ACLY phosphorylation (data not shown).
ACLY phosphorylation is directly regulated by PI3K-Akt
pathway. Next, we determined whether ACLY is a downstream
target of the PI3K-Akt pathway in lung cancer. Treatment with
LY294002 or wortmannin (data not shown), PI3K inhibitors,

resulted in the decrease in ACLY phosphorylation in a dose- and
time-dependent manner in A549 cells, in parallel with a dramatic
decrease in Akt phosphorylation (Fig. 1C). In addition, U0126, a
MAPK inhibitor, did not affect p-ACLY expression (data not
shown). To determine whether Akt, a downstream effecter of PI3K,
directly regulates ACLY phosphorylation, constitutively active Akt
or dominant-negative Akt were introduced into NCI-H23 and CORL105 cells. The introduction of constitutively active Akt into the
cells resulted in the enhancement of ACLY phosphorylation,
whereas the dominant negative Akt attenuated ACLY phosphorylation (Fig. 1D). Total ACLY levels were not changed substantially.
ACLY is activated and a prognostic factor in human lung
adenocarcinomas. We then assessed ACLY expression and activity
in human lung adenocarcinoma tissues. The average mRNA level of
ACLY was up-regulated 2.1-fold compared with that in corresponding normal tissue samples (P < 0.05; Fig. 2A). Western blot
also revealed p-ACLY levels to be much higher in lung adenocarcinomas than in background lung tissue, whereas total ACLY
levels were slightly increased in lung adenocarcinoma (Fig. 2B).
In spite of higher amounts of the precursor form of SREBP-1 in
tumors, the levels of the mature form tended to be lower than in
corresponding normal tissue (Fig. 2B). In line with expression
analysis, ACLY activity was significantly higher in tumors compared
with normal tissue (P < 0.01; Fig. 2C).
To identify associations with clinicopathologic variables, IHC for
p-ACLY was performed on TMA. p-ACLY expression in tumor tissue

ACLY Is Activated in Non–Small Cell Lung Cancer

Figure 3. ACLY inhibition induces cell-cycle arrest in A549 cells in vitro. A, ACLY protein levels of A549 cells transfected with negative control siRNA or three different
ACLY siRNA oligonucleotides were determined by Western blot analysis at 72 h after transfection. Immunocytochemistry was performed with the cells treated with
negative control siRNA or ACLY siRNA #1 (unless otherwise noted) using total ACLY and p-ACLY antibodies. Both proteins were detected in the cytoplasm as well as in
the nucleus (arrows ). B, flow cytometry showing changes of cell-cycle phase distribution 72 h after siRNA treatment.

was detected in both cytoplasm and nucleus of tumor cells,
whereas was barely detectable in the corresponding normal tissue.
Among the 162 tumor samples, immunostaining intensity was
variable (Fig. 2D, a–c). There was a strong p-ACLY expression in
63.0% (102 of 162) of patients with lung adenocarcinoma.
Comparison between clinicopathologic variables and p-ACLY levels
revealed that positivity for p-ACLY was significantly associated
with advanced stage (P < 0.01), the presence of pleural invasion
(P < 0.01), and poor differentiation (P < 0.001; Table 1). These findings suggest that high expression of p-ACLY could be generally
related to aggressive biological behavior of lung cancer.
Cytosomal and/or nuclear staining of p-Akt was observed in
62.3% (101 of 162) of lung adenocarcinoma cases (Table 1), and we
found that the p-Akt and p-ACLY immunostaining patterns well
correlated (Table 1; Fig. 2D, d and e).
Next, we examined the relationship between expression of pACLY and survival in patients with lung adenocarcinoma (n = 162).
The 5-year survival was 96.5% in patients with p-ACLY–low lung
adenocarcinomas, whereas it was 63% in patients with p-ACLY–
high lung adenocarcinomas (P < 0.0001; Fig. 2E). On univariate Cox
regression analyses, stage, tumor size, pleural invasion, gender,
tumor differentiation, and p-ACLY expression were significantly
associated with survival (P < 0.05). Furthermore, in the multivariate

www.aacrjournals.org

model with these significant covariates, p-ACLY expression was a
significant factor for prediction of a poor prognosis (P = 0.0025),
together with stage and tumor size (P = 0.00029 and P = 0.027,
respectively).
ACLY is a therapeutic target in non–small cell lung cancer.
To determine whether ACLY is a therapeutic target in lung cancer, we analyzed the phenotype of A549 cells treated with
ACLY inhibition. All three oligonucleotides of ACLY siRNA resulted
in an efficient knockdown of total ACLY protein levels, as
determined by Western blot and immunocytochemistry (Fig. 3A).
Phoshophorylated and total ACLY proteins were localized in the
cytoplasm as well as in the nucleus (Fig. 3A, arrows). Morphologically, ACLY knockdown was associated with curved, thinner,
and elongated cells, in contrast to negative control siRNA.
DNA flow cytometric analysis indicated that ACLY knockdown
induced a progressive reduction in the S phase fraction associated with a progressive parallel accumulation of G1 phase
(control siRNA: G1, 51.5%; S, 32.6%; G2-M, 15.9%; ACLY siRNA: G1,
79.0%; S, 4.0%; G2-M, 17.1%; Fig. 3B). No significant increase
of sub-G1 cell population was observed at least 72 hours after
ACLY knockdown. Microscopic observations of trypan blue staining revealed negligible cell death after ACLY knockdown (data
not shown).

Next, to examine the effects of ACLY inhibition on lipogenesis
and cell proliferation, we assessed ACLY activity, de novo fatty acid
synthesis, intracellular lipid levels, and cell numbers. The treatment of LY294002 or ACLY knockdown resulted in a significant
decrease in ACLY activity (Fig. 4A, a). As anticipated, the decreased
conversion rate of glucose to lipid was observed after the treatment
of LY294002 or ACLY knockdown (Fig. 4A, b), consistent with
previous report (13). However, despite the impairment of de novo
lipogenesis, lipidTOX, or oil red O (data not shown) staining
revealed the markedly increased accumulation of phospholipids
and neutral lipids in the cytoplasm after the ACLY knockdown
(Fig. 4A, c). Cell proliferation was decreased significantly in the cells
treated with LY294002 (data not shown) or ACLY siRNA compared
with negative control siRNA (Fig. 4B). To examine whether the
growth arrest induced by ACLY inhibition was related to the
impairment of glucose or lipid metabolism, ACLY knockdown cells
were exposed for 24 hours to exogenous insulin or palmitate. The
supplementation of insulin improved cell proliferation when
compared with ACLY siRNA alone (P < 0.005; Fig. 4B), whereas
palmitate markedly suppressed cell proliferation accompanied by
cell death (P < 0.001; Fig. 4B).
Finally, to confirm the efficacy of ACLY inhibition in vivo, siRNA
oligo with atelocollagen was injected into A549 cell xenografts
in nude mice. ACLY siRNA treatment significantly inhibited
tumor growth (P < 0.0001; Fig. 5A) and enhanced gland formation of A549 cells (Fig. 5B, arrows), whereas no significant weight
loss or other toxicity was observed in both groups (data not

shown). It should be noted that loss of p-ACLY and Ki-67 expression was confined to the glandular structures of A549 cells, suggesting ACLY is involved in tumor differentiation and proliferation
(Fig. 5B, arrows).

Discussion
Metabolic changes are commonly observed in malignant cells. In
the 1920s, Otto Warburg (19) discovered that cancer cells displayed
high aerobic glycolysis, in contrast to normal cells. It was further
found that cancers derive most fatty acids from de novo synthesis
(20). Although the ultimate reasons for high glycolysis and
lipogenesis in cancer cells are not completely understood, it seems
that cancer cells can coordinate the related metabolic enzymes and
can use all products effectively.
ACLY is the first key enzyme of lipogenesis and a crosslink
between glucose and lipid metabolism. ACLY overexpression or
activation have been reported in urinary bladder, breast, liver,
stomach, colon, and prostate tumors (21–26). However, to the best
of our knowledge, this is the first observation of ACLY activation in
lung cancer.
It has been reported that ACLY activity is regulated by the
PI3K-Akt signaling pathway through the phosphorylation (11, 27).
Akt also up-regulates ACLY mRNA levels via activation of SREBP-1,
a transcription factor of cholesterol and fatty acid biosynthesis
(28, 29). We observed a positive correlation among mRNA, total
protein, and phosphorylated protein levels of ACLY in lung

under the treatment of LY294002 or siRNA. The treatment of LY294002 or ACLY siRNA significantly reduced ACLY activity compared with control (P < 0.05 and
P < 0.005, respectively). b, conversion rate of glucose to lipid was measured with 14C-glucose under the treatment of LY294002 or siRNA. c, intracellular lipid
accumulation was assessed using lipids conjugated to fluorescent dyes. ACLY knockdown stimulates the incorporation of extralipids. B, exogenous palmitate does not
rescue the growth arrest induced by ACLY inhibition. Cell proliferation was measured 72 h after siRNA treatment. Cells were also treated for 24 h in the presence
of 20 Ag/mL insulin or 100 Amol/L palmitate-BSA complex. *, P < 0.005. **, P < 0.001. Columns, means; bars, SD.

ACLY Is Activated in Non–Small Cell Lung Cancer

Figure 5. siRNA against ACLY inhibits tumor growth in vivo . A549 cells were
inoculated s.c. in 20 nude mice and were allowed to grow for 10 d. Then,
mice were divided into 2 groups, and ACLY siRNA#1 or negative control
siRNA were injected into the tumors at weekly intervals for 5 wk. A, tumor growth
curves in nude mice. ACLY siRNA (5 Amol/L) or the negative control siRNA
(5 Amol/L) were mixed with atelocollagen, and a 200 AL aliquot of either mixture
was injected into the tumor region. Tumor diameters and body weight were
measured at weekly intervals and tumor volumes were calculated. Points, mean
(n = 10 tumors per group); bars, SE. Significant difference curves were
evaluated by an exponential regression analysis (P < 0.0001). B, H&E staining

adenocarcinoma cell lines and clinical samples. However, ACLY
protein levels were independent of SREBP-1, and there was an
inverse relationship between mRNA of ACLY and SREBP-1,
consistent with previous reports (30, 31). Thus, activation of the
PI3K-Akt pathway may stimulate ACLY activity predominantly
through its phosphorylation rather than transcriptional upregulation and, may in part, contribute to protein stabilization.
ACLY can be phosphorylated at different site by other kinase
such as nucleoside diphosphate kinase (32) and cyclic AMPdependent protein kinase (33). Our study showed that despite the
treatment of PI3K inhibitors resulted in the rapid and the sufficient
dephosphorylation of Akt, it did the dephosphorylation of ACLY
with less efficiency. Furthermore, ACLY activity was also decreased
with the treatment of PI3K inhibitors, but its effect on activity was
not as great as that of ACLY knockdown. Therefore, this suggested
that ACLY activity is also regulated by other than PI3K-Akt pathway
in lung cancer.
ACLY is considered to be localized in the cytoplasm and
generates cytosolic acetyl-CoA from citrate. However, we observed
the nuclear and cytoplasmic localization of ACLY protein in cell
lines as well as in clinical samples. ACLY as a nuclear
phosphoprotein has been shown in HeLa cells (34), but the
function of nuclear ACLY remains to be elucidated. Further study is
required to understand the molecular basis of differential ACLY
subcellular localization.

Recent evidence suggests that dysregulated lipogenesis plays a
causal role in cancer pathogenesis (35). FASN, which is a downstream de novo lipogenic enzyme of ACLY, is frequently overexpressed in many cancers. Interestingly, the genes of key
lipogenic enzymes including acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), FASN,
and ACLY are all located at the 17q chromosome, and gene
amplification has been reported in prostate cancer (36). Importantly, inhibition of FASN induces apoptosis in a variety of cancer
cells concomitant with the decrease in phospholipids (37, 38).
Supplementation of palmitate, which is the fatty acid generated
by FASN, rescues apoptosis induced by ACC or FASN inhibition (39–41). To investigate potential mechanisms for the growth
arrest induce by ACLY inhibition, we assessed de novo lipogenesis
and cell proliferation in an ACLY knockdown model. First,
the conversion rate from glucose to lipid was dramatically
decreased by ACLY knockdown concomitant with the decrease
in cell proliferation. Next, we found that the intracellular lipid
levels were increased by ACLY knockdown, albeit de novo synthesis
was impaired. Finally, the supplementation of insulin could
improve cell proliferation; however, palmitate induced cell death
in these cells. Taken all together, it is tempting to speculate
that ACLY inhibition may affect cell proliferation due to the
impairment of glucose metabolism rather than due to the
depletion of lipid products generated by fatty acids or cholesterol
synthesis. Because ACLY integrates glucose metabolism with lipid
synthesis, ACLY inactivation could potentially affect not only lipid
metabolism but also glucose metabolism. Our data showed that
ACLY inhibition, unlike FASN or ACC inhibition, lead to
proliferation arrest but not apoptosis. One possible mechanism is
that the salvage of extracellular lipids can prevent cell death. The
precise mechanism of lipid accumulation induced by ACLY
inhibition will require further study.
Importantly, p-ACLY overexpression was significantly correlated
with tumor differentiation and poorer prognosis in our cohort.
Because all patients enrolled in this study were operable with a
relatively early stage, ACLY can be a useful marker for the
identification of early-stage tumors with poorer prognosis. Besides,
given that in vivo treatment with ACLY siRNA inhibited tumor
growth in xenograft model, ACLY can be an attractive target for
RNA interference therapy in the clinical setting.
There is a growing realization that signaling abnormalities
within nutrient signaling pathways, for example loss-of-function
mutations in the LKB1, TSC, and PTEN, can lead to transformation
and tumor progression (42). Cancer cells need to obtain high
energy and macromolecules effectively. Because ACLY integrates
between glycolytic and lipogenic process, it may be important for
the coordination of cancer cell metabolism.
Recent cancer research has highlighted the importance of lipid
metabolism in cancer cells (35, 43). The present study provided a
solid link between a metabolic network and lung cancer
pathogenesis. We believe research into ACLY will open up
opportunities for identifying new drugs for treatment of this
deadly disease as well as other types of malignant tumors.
