ABSTRACT
Predictive biomarkers have the potential to facilitate cancer precision medicine
by guiding the optimal choice of therapies for patients. However, clinicians are faced
with an enormous volume of often-contradictory evidence regarding the therapeutic
context of chemopredictive biomarkers.
We extensively surveyed public literature to systematically review the predictive
effect of 7 biomarkers claimed to predict response to various chemotherapy drugs:
ERCC1-platinums, RRM1-gemcitabine, TYMS-5-fluorouracil/Capecitabine, TUBB3taxanes, MGMT-temozolomide, TOP1-irinotecan/topotecan, and TOP2A-anthracyclines.
We focused on studies that investigated changes in gene or protein expression as
predictors of drug sensitivity or resistance. We considered an evidence framework
that ranked studies from high level I evidence for randomized controlled trials to low
level IV evidence for pre-clinical studies and patient case studies.
We found that further in-depth analysis will be required to explore methodological
issues, inconsistencies between studies, and tumor specific effects present even
within high evidence level studies. Some of these nuances will lend themselves
to automation, others will require manual curation. However, the comprehensive
cataloging and analysis of dispersed public data utilizing an evidence framework
provides a high level perspective on clinical actionability of these protein biomarkers.
This framework and perspective will ultimately facilitate clinical trial design as well
as therapeutic decision-making for individual patients.

that should translate into better selection of therapies for
patients. Remarkable successes in this field include the
FDA approval of Trastuzumab for breast cancer patients
overexpressing the HER2 protein [1] and Erlotinib for
metastatic non-small cell lung cancer patients (NSCLC)

with exon 19 deletion or exon 21 (L858R) substitution in
the EGFR gene [2]. However, not all tumors have actionable
genomic alterations and/or available matching targeted
therapies. For example, majority of pancreatic cancers that
harbor activating KRAS mutations have no effective targeted
therapies [3]. Therefore, despite the promise of targeted
therapies, chemotherapy still remains the most widely used
standard of treatment for both advanced, metastatic cancer
patients, and in the adjuvant setting.
While the use of predictive biomarkers in personalizing
targeted cancer therapies is common, it is not yet a standard
approach for chemotherapy. This is primarily due to the lack
of compelling evidence from biomarker-driven studies to
support their clinical utility [4–6]. Therefore, there is a clear
need to comprehensively curate and evaluate literaturebased datasets within an evidence framework to determine
the quantity and quality of evidence supporting or refuting
the clinical utility of these biomarkers. Such evidence
frameworks currently exist to determine the clinical utility of
predictive biomarkers for targeted therapies [7–9]. However,
to our knowledge, this approach has not been used to assess
the clinical utility of chemopredictive biomarkers. Our goal
was to perform an exhaustive literature review to assess the
overall levels of evidence supporting the clinical utility of a
shortlist of chemopredictive biomarkers, using an evidence
framework that is based on widely accepted guidelines. We
hope this work can serve as a reference to evaluate future
predictive biomarkers published in the field.
Numerous studies have shown that the expression
of DNA repair genes like ERCC1, β-tubulins or
topoisomerases can predict response to platinum, taxanes
and other cytotoxic agents respectively [10–12]. We
identified 7 biomarkers that have been evaluated in a
number of tumor types (Table 1) for their role in predicting
response to commonly approved chemotherapy drugs in
the first-line, advanced, metastatic and adjuvant treatment
settings. These biomarker therapy combinations are
ERCC1–platinum drugs, RRM1–gemcitabine, TUBB3–
taxanes, TYMS–5-fluorocuracil (5-FU)/Capecitabine,
MGMT–temozolomide, TOP1–irinotecan/topotecan
and TOP2A–anthracyclines. Several CLIA and/or CAP
certified molecular diagnostic assays measure expression
levels of these biomarkers in cancer tissue to determine
their sensitivity to chemotherapy drugs. Therefore, we
specifically examined how gene or protein expression
changes in these biomarkers affect sensitivity or resistance
to the associated chemotherapy agents.
We conducted a comprehensive literature review
from 1990-2015 on the predictive effect of gene or
protein expression of these 7 biomarkers and associated
chemotherapy drugs. The information from each study was
systematically organized to minimize bias and maximize
retrieval of relevant information in order to create a gold
standard dataset (data available in supplementary tables).
The level of evidence for each study was evaluated within
an evidence framework which was adapted from widely
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

accepted guidelines [13–15] Figure 1C. This dataset
can inform future automation of information extraction
through Natural Language Processing (NLP) approaches.
Our results highlight a general need for more and higher
quality level I evidence supporting clinical utility of
chemopredictive biomarkers. Such an approach can help
researchers and clinicians evaluate the clinical utility of
chemopredictive biomarkers, thus enabling design of
clinical trials and decision-making for patient care.

METHODS
Figure 1 shows the overall workflow used to
evaluate and summarize the evidence supporting the use
of the 7 chemopredictive biomarkers for personalizing
cancer treatment

Search and retrieval
We searched PubTator [16] for the following keyword
combination: gene/protein name, the term “expression” and
“drug name”; for example “TUBB3 expression and taxanes”.
Studies published between 1/1/1990 – 12/31/2015 that focused
on predictive biomarkers whose gene or protein expression
influenced response to chemotherapy were shortlisted for
manual curation, Figure 1A. Articles that primarily focused on
prognostic biomarkers were excluded. Non-English articles
were excluded unless the abstracts contained all the necessary
information to populate the framework. Important citations
from the selected articles were also curated.

Data collection
The following data elements were collected from
each article and organized using controlled vocabulary
wherever possible, Figure 1B:
• Disease – type of cancer and stage (early,
advanced, metastatic, etc.)
• Biomarker – biomarker name, assay type used,
other genes being studied, over and/or under expression
status. The expression status is defined by the study and
can be based on comparisons with all tumor samples,
adjacent normal samples, or normal samples from
unaffected individuals.
• Therapy – combinations of chemotherapy drugs
that the patient/s was/were given and the therapy setting
(first line, second line, adjuvant, etc.).
• Outcomes – outcome measures including, but not
limited to, progression-free survival (PFS), disease-free
survival, overall survival (OS), tumor response rate and
tumor recurrence.
• Study details – model system being studied, for
example cell line, animal models or human. For human studies
we collected the inclusion, exclusion criteria and sample size,
if available. Study metadata such as journal name, year of
publication and publication source were also collected.

Evidence framework

• Therapeutic context – predictive effect of
biomarker expression on therapy outcome was interpreted
from the results of the study.

Evidence levels broadly ranging from I-IV were
assigned to each publication based on its study design
Figure 1C, adapted from widely accepted guidelines
[13–15]. Randomized clinical trials were assigned the
highest evidence level I, followed by level II evidence
for non-randomized trials, level III evidence for
observational studies and lowest evidence level IV for
pre-clinical studies, expert opinions and case studies.
Within each evidence level, we incorporated sub-levels
of evidence based on additional characteristics of study
type, including prospective and retrospective analysis
and sample size. Meta-analyses were usually assigned
the highest sub-level evidence, since they integrate all
the available evidence pertaining to a scientific question
of interest and quantitatively summarize the results [17].
Depending on the type of studies (e.g. randomized, nonrandomized, etc.) included in the meta-analyses, they
were categorized under the corresponding evidence levels
I-IV. Furthermore, within each evidence category ranging
from I-III, prospective studies were ranked higher than
retrospective studies. Systematic reviews were carefully

Biocuration
Expert curation and analysis was conducted
by a multi-disciplinary group including: oncologists,
molecular biologists, translational researchers, a surgeon,
biocurators, bioinformaticians and biostatisticians.

Predictive effect of biomarker
The predictive effect of the biomarker was
determined from the results and conclusions reported in
each study, captured under the following categories:
• Benefit: Over or under expression of the biomarker
predicted sensitivity to therapy
• No Benefit: Over or under expression of the
biomarker did not predict response to therapy
• Not Assessable: Results of the study were
inconclusive for over and/or under expression of the
biomarker.

were assigned high evidence level (IB). The term “high
quality” meta-analysis or review in the figure refers to
these stringent criteria, not to journal impact factor. Expert
opinions that had a built-in rigorous meta-analysis were
assigned to level I. Reviews including different study types
and lacking stringent patient and/or study inclusion criteria
were assigned a lower evidence level (IVD). Each study
was considered individually for evidence assignment and
no effort was made to combine evidence across studies
using meta-analysis approaches.

RESULTS

Pre-clinical studies have suggested that
underexpression of ERCC1 sensitizes cancer cells
to platinum agents whereas overexpression induces
resistance [18, 19]. 70% of the studies in our dataset
confirm this hypothesis, where the majority of the
evidence is from levels I-III retrospective studies. The
predictive effect of ERCC1 underexpression on response
to platinum agents has been widely studied in NSCLC

(Table 1). Out of the two level IC clinical trials in our
dataset, one study had no benefit for PFS. In this study,
an internal control suggested the possibility of biased
randomization, thereby confounding the result, and
therefore we have determined the results of this study to
be not assessable [20]. A second level IC study confirmed
a modest response rate advantage (the primary endpoint),
while failing to confirm PFS benefit (secondary
endpoint). While we have counted this study as
supporting the biomarker hypothesis, a study evaluating
the clinical benefit endpoint as primary would be very
helpful in determining the clinical significance of this
result [21]. Two level III studies showed contradictory
evidence in advanced NSCLC and metastatic pancreatic
cancer patients where overexpression of ERCC1 showed
benefit from platinum based chemotherapy [22, 23]. 22
studies in our dataset had results that were not assessable
due to various reasons including different methods of
biomarker quantification, disease type, stage and small
sample size [24–28] (Supplementary Table 1). While
the evidence supporting the chemosensitizing effect of
ERCC1 underexpression in response to platinum agents
was somewhat consistent across all retrospective studies
in NSCLC, the evidence for other cancer types was often
inconclusive or contradictory. The overall evidence
for other cancer types was mainly from low-level IIIIV studies [29–33]. Moreover, the predictive effect of
immunostaining for ERCC1 protein has been difficult

to confirm in validation studies. This can be attributed
to discrepancies in the performance of antibody batches
over the years and also a lack of understanding of the
heterogeneous expression and function of different
ERCC1 protein isoforms [34].

O6-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase
(MGMT) - temozolomide
Underexpression of MGMT is thought to sensitize
tumor cells to temozolomide (TMZ)-based therapies
whereas overexpression induces resistance [35–38].
This hypothesis was widely tested and confirmed in
gliomas and pituitary tumors (Table 1, Supplementary
Table 2). We found that the overall evidence supporting
the chemosensitizing effect of MGMT underexpression
on TMZ response is mainly from level IV pre-clinical
studies and a few level II-III retrospective studies
(Figure 2). The results from 13 studies, including a
high-level ID retrospective biomarker study were
not assessable [39–42]. In addition to gene/protein
expression, we also found several studies that evaluated
the predictive effect of MGMT promoter methylation
on TMZ response, including the landmark study by
Hegi et.al [43] that drives the current clinical use of
MGMT as a predictive biomarker for TMZ response
in glioblastoma multiforme. Such studies were not
included in our dataset since they did not meet our

the predictive effect of biomarker expression on response to corresponding chemotherapy drugs defined in terms of benefit, no benefit or
not assessable. Studies where chemotherapy response was not assessable for both, over and under expression of biomarkers have been
represented twice, in the over and under expression section. For example, in the RRM1-Gemcitabine plot, a total of six level III studies
showed that gemcitabine response is not assessable for both over and under expression of RRM1 and the same six studies are plotted in
both over and under expression histograms (blue).

inclusion criteria, which focused only on predictive
biomarkers whose gene/protein expression influenced
response to chemotherapy. In studies that tested the
predictive effect of both MGMT expression and
promoter methylation on TMZ response, there was
often poor correlation between the two, which resulted
in inconclusive results [44].

survival than the underexpressing cases [69]. The
chemosensitizing effect of TYMS underexpression was
not assessable in 11 studies whereas 3 studies showed
no benefit of TYMS underexpression on 5-FU therapy.
Further prospective studies in large well-defined patient
populations are necessary to determine the clinical utility
of this biomarker. Moreover, ~27 studies in our dataset
examined the predictive effect of other biomarkers like
TP, DPD and ERCC1 in addition to TYMS in response
to 5-FU based therapies. This makes it difficult to
determine the predictive effect of TYMS alone on 5-FU
response [70].

Ribonucleotide reductase subunit M1 (RRM1) gemcitabine
Pre-clinical studies have shown that RRM1
underexpression is associated with benefit of gemcitabinebased therapy whereas overexpression is associated with
resistance [45–47]. This trend is consistent in 80% of the
studies across all evidence levels I-IV. The predictive
effect of RRM1 underexpression on benefit of response
to gemcitabine was mainly studied in NSCLCs and
confirmed by a level IC clinical trial [20]. In pancreatic
cancers, the overall evidence supporting the predictive
effect of RRM1 was equivocal and investigated only in
levels III-IV studies [48–55].
A number of NSCLC studies analyzed the combined
predictive effect of both RRM1 and ERCC1 expression,
perhaps because treatment for NSCLCs usually includes
gemcitabine in combination with platinum drugs. While a
level IIA multi-trial NSCLC study confirmed that patients
who received personalized first-line therapy based on
their RRM1 and ERCC1 gene expression status had better
survival than patients on standard therapy [56], a level IIIF
study of a three drug concurrent regimen [57] produced
results which were contradictory to previous studies, in
that responders had low gene expression levels ERCC1
as expected but high levels of RRM1. It can be difficult
to determine single marker outcomes from such multimarker studies.

Class III beta-tubulin (TUBB3)-taxanes
Pre-clinical studies have suggested that
underexpression of TUBB3 predicts sensitivity to
taxanes whereas overexpression predicts resistance
in breast cancer, NSCLC and gastric cancers [71–73].
This hypothesis was mainly supported by 11 level IV
pre-clinical studies and 14 level III retrospective studies
(Table 1, Figure 2). We did not find any evidence from
prospective biomarker driven trials to support the
predictive effect of TUBB3 underexpression on response
to taxanes. The results from 9 studies that evaluated
taxane response in patients under/over expressing
TUBB3 were not assessable [74–82]. In a level ID breast
cancer study [76], patients overexpressing TUBB3 had
a higher probability of response to docetaxel but the
predictive effect of TUBB3 underexpression was not
assessable. This unusual predictive effect of TUBB3
expression has also been reported in patient populations
that received taxanes in an adjuvant or advanced disease
setting [83].

Type I topoisomerase (TOP1)-irinotecan/
topotecan

Thymidylate synthase (TYMS)-5-fluorouracil/
capecitabine

Studies on gastrointestinal cancers have suggested
that overexpression of TOP1 predicts benefit of
camptothecin-based therapies [84–88]. However, the
evidence associated with the predictive effect of TOP1
expression status and therapy outcome was mostly of
low-level and studies often reported inconclusive results
[89–91] (Figure 2). A level ID post-hoc biomarker
correlative analysis of the FOCUS trial showed an
overall survival benefit in a subset of colorectal cancer
patients with moderate/high TOP1 levels measured by
immunohistochemistry [92]. However, another similar
level ID study conducted by the Dutch Colorectal
Cancer Group showed no association between TOP1
expression and survival benefit [93]. Moreover,
Meisenberg et al. reported an important correlation
between TOP1 and TDP1, suggesting the possible role
of other predictive markers in irinotecan/topotecan
sensitivity [94].

Pre-clinical studies have demonstrated that
underexpression of TYMS predicts benefit of response
to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)-based therapies whereas
overexpression predicts no benefit [58–64]. Our dataset
also included studies that tested TYMS expression and
response to 5-FU’s prodrug, Capecitabine [10, 64–68].
We found that evidence supporting the chemosensitizing
effect of TYMS under expression on 5-FU/Capecitabine
is mainly from levels II-III retrospective biomarker
analysis of clinical studies (Figure 2). This hypothesis
was widely tested and confirmed in gastrointestinal
cancers especially colorectal cancers (Table 1,
Supplementary Table 4). However, the only level
IC clinical trial in our dataset showed contradictory
evidence where metastatic colorectal cancer patients
overexpressing TYMS had a trend towards better overall

inconsistency in results and conclusions from different
assays, statistical tests or for different endpoints, and 5)
inconsistency in clinical information across tumor types.
Moreover, since chemotherapy drugs are often given in
combination, it may be difficult to determine the predictive
effect of a single biomarker-drug combination.
The work summarized herein focuses the effort
on a manageable number of studies, which need to be
reviewed in greater detail, making such a task feasible.
Level I evidence outweighs lower levels of evidence
but within the level I evidence framework all studies
cannot be considered equal. More detailed curation
of such studies is required to rank them based on the
strength of evidence they provide. Critical factors to
assess within the level I evidence category include study
population, endpoints, and appropriate controls; amount
of missing data; assay validation; sample collection and
processing; statistical and clinical significance of the
results, and confounders. Evaluation of these criteria
may help to resolve conflicts between studies if one
provides stronger evidence than another. Limitations of
the current level I studies hamper our ability to draw
firm conclusions about the current clinical applicability
of these biomarkers.
As more data emerges on novel “actionable”
pathways in cancers, this evidence framework will need
further development as outlined above to assess clinical
actionability. The framework can be applied to enhance
the value of the increasing volume of retrospective data
collection. However, the framework will likely highlight
the need for additional prospective studies and help
guide their design. These critical future steps will allow
the cancer precision medicine community to collectively
evaluate and accept predictive biomarkers for cancer
therapy.

The TOP2A gene is overexpressed in several
cancer types and is hypothesized to predict sensitivity to
anthracycline-based therapies [95, 96]. However, our only
high evidence study (level ID) on hepatocellular carcinoma
patients showed no benefit of TOP2A overexpression on
anthracycline based therapies [97]. 71% of the studies in
our dataset showed levels II-IV evidence supporting this
hypothesis, where either overexpression of TOP2A was
associated with benefit or underexpression was associated
with no benefit from anthracycline-based therapy
(Figure 2, Supplementary Table 7). Since anthracyclines
are frequently used in breast cancer treatments, we
found this disease to be most widely represented in our
dataset, especially in HER2+ breast cancer. However, we
did not find any high evidence level I studies on TOP2A
overexpression as a predictor of response to anthracyclines
in this review and analysis.

DISCUSSION
Herein, we provided a high level quantitative
perspective on the amount and quality of evidence
supporting or contradicting the clinical utility of
chemopredictive biomarkers. In our evaluation, we
found that biomarker-driven prospective clinical trials
(levels I-II) for these protein-drug pairs were few
and often reported findings that were inconclusive or
contradictory. We found somewhat consistent evidence
from several retrospective biomarker analyses across
levels I-III in NSCLC supporting the chemosensitizing
effect of both ERCC1 and RRM1 underexpression in
response to platinum and gemcitabine based treatments
respectively. The evidence supporting the predictive role
of gene/protein expression of TYMS–5FU/Capecitabine
in colorectal cancers, TUBB3-taxanes in NSCLC and
MGMT–temozolomide in brain tumors was modest and
mainly from level III observational studies and level IV
pre-clinical studies. There was sparse evidence from
level III retrospective studies and level IV pre-clinical
studies supporting the chemosensitizing effect of TOP1
and TOP2A overexpression in response to camptothecinbased therapies and anthracyclines in gastrointestinal and
breast cancers respectively. Other studies that assessed
promoter methylation in MGMT and amplification in
TOP1 and TOP2A were not considered in this assessment.
Our analysis highlights the need for more well-designed
and higher quality level I evidence studies for the 7
chemopredictive biomarker – drug pairs.
Standardizing and organizing relevant information
from different biomarker studies presents several challenges
1) author preferences in presenting the information 2)
author bias resulting in discrepancies between the summary
statements and the actual evidence 3) diversity of methods
