Abstract
Little research has been done to address the huge opportunities that may exist to reposition existing approved
or generic drugs for alternate uses in cancer therapy. In addition, there has been little work on strategies to
reposition experimental cancer agents for testing in alternate settings that could shorten their clinical
development time. Progress in each area has lagged, in part, because of the lack of systematic methods to
deﬁne drug off-target effects (OTE) that might affect important cancer cell signaling pathways. In this study, we
addressed this critical gap by developing an OTE-based method to repurpose drugs for cancer therapeutics, based
on transcriptional responses made in cells before and after drug treatment. Speciﬁcally, we deﬁned a new network
component called cancer-signaling bridges (CSB) and integrated it with a Bayesian factor regression model
(BFRM) to form a new hybrid method termed CSB-BFRM. Proof-of-concept studies were conducted in breast and
prostate cancer cells and in promyelocytic leukemia cells. In each system, CSB-BFRM analysis could accurately
predict clinical responses to more than 90% of drugs approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and
more than 75% of experimental clinical drugs that were tested. Mechanistic investigation of OTEs for several highranking drug–dose pairs suggested repositioning opportunities for cancer therapy, based on the ability to enforce
retinoblastoma-dependent repression of important E2F-dependent cell-cycle genes. Together, our ﬁndings
establish new methods to identify opportunities for drug repositioning or to elucidate the mechanisms of
action of repositioned drugs. Cancer Res; 72(1); 33–44. 2011 AACR.

Major Findings
By developing a systematic approach to characterize offtarget effects of drugs, this study may help the ﬁeld learn
how to reposition existing approved and generic drugs for
alternate uses in cancer treatment.

Introduction
The study of drug repositioning has so far been limited to the
"on-target repositioning" that applies a drug's known pharmacologic mechanism to a different therapeutic indication, for

example, comparing the structural similarities of small molecules (1, 2) or known side effects (3). In contrast, "off-target
repositioning" attempts to describe the pharmacologic
mechanisms still unclear for known molecules. A number of
approaches have recently been developed for off-target repositioning with the use of gene signatures (4–7),—subsets of
genes, or drug similarity networks (8), identiﬁed in the cancer
transcriptional proﬁles following drug treatment. One common limitation of these methods is that they do not include the
disease-speciﬁc prior knowledge or known mechanisms in the
off-target repositioning process, so that they can be used to
ﬁnd similarities between the drugs but not the preference
between them. Thus, we need to develop a method that
incorporates prior knowledge of speciﬁc diseases to provide
a more precise off-target drug repositioning.
A primary challenge of off-target repositioning is to address
the off-target effects (OTE) of a drug on the proteins downstream in the signaling pathways and the genes that are
regulated by those proteins. As an example, in breast cancer,
raloxifene, tamoxifen, and fulvestrant are the pioneering drugs
targeting the estrogen receptor (ER; ref. 9). The targeted
proteins, however, often generate downstream effects on the
linked signaling proteins and ultimately exert unexpected
OTEs on cancer transcription (10–12). Creighton and colleagues (12) showed that tamoxifen together with estrogen deprivation (ED) can shut down classic estrogen signaling and
activate alternative pathways such as HER2, which can also
regulate gene expression. The unexpected downstream signaling proteins and altered cancer transcription can be considered as the off-targets of the treated drugs.

Quick Guide to Main Model Equations
The strategy for off-target drug repositioning is illustrated in Fig. 1. Facilitated by cancer-signaling bridges (CSB), we established
a new method to facilitate drug repositioning for cancer therapy.

S is denoted as a protein set of a signaling pathway [i.e., NCI-PID (Pathway Interaction Database) or BioCarta pathway (ref. 13)].

ðAÞ

Off-Target Repositioning Method: CSB Bayesian Factor Regression Model
Bayesian factor regression model (BFRM; 16, 17) is applied to the off-target drug repositioning. BFRM deconvolutes the cancer
transcriptional response data into signatures with a model of the form
Xi ¼ Ali þ i ði ¼ 1; 2; . . . ; mÞ

ðBÞ

where Xi is an n dimension vector of fold-change (treatment vs. control) of drug i in the cancer transcriptional response data;
Xj;i ; j ¼ 1; 2; . . . ;n, is the median value of fold-changes of gene j in consideration of corresponding instances treated by drug i; m is
the number of drugs; and n is the number of the coding genes for the CSB proteins expanded by the cancer proteins of a speciﬁc
cancer type. A ¼ ða1 ; a2 ; . . . ; ak Þ is a sparse n  k matrix whose columns deﬁne the signatures Sl ; l ¼ 1; 2; . . . ; k, and each
numerical value Aj;l deﬁnes the weight of gene j in the column of gene signature Sl. To address which parts of the cancer signals are
responsible for the unknown pharmacologic mechanisms and to what extent they are targeted, the CSB-BFRM method needs to
identify signatures (the targeted parts in the cancer signals) and effects (OTEs on the targeted parts; Fig. 1B). Thus, we deﬁne a
weight matrix, A, as a combination of one output of BFRM, A, and another matrix, P ¼ ðr1 ; r2 ; . . . ; rk Þ, that contains the
(sparse) probabilities that each gene is associated with each signature (refer to Materials and Methods). We call the matrix,
L ¼ ðl1 ; l2 ; . . . ; lm Þ, an effect matrix. Each numerical value, Ll;i , deﬁnes the effect of drug i imposed on the gene signature, Sl.
 ¼ ð1 ; 2 ; . . . ; m Þ reﬂects measurement error and residual biologic noise.
Repositioning proﬁle
The OTEs of a drug on a speciﬁc cancer are deﬁned as a repositioning proﬁle using A and L (Fig. 1C). A repositioning proﬁle,
 ¼ ðv1 ; v2 ; . . . ; vm ÞT , is an m  k matrix to characterize the overall effects of m drugs on k signatures. The known drug targets
are essential for identiﬁcation of a repositioning proﬁle. The targetable signatures are deﬁned by the non-zero weights at the
rows of the targets across signatures of A. We denote the targetable signatures for drug i as a set Ti. For each targetable signature
t 2 Ti , we deﬁne the product between Rt and the effect score Li;t as the overall effect of drug i imposed on signature t,
P
i;t ¼ Rt  Li;t , where Rt ¼ nj¼1 Aj;t denotes the response (or total weight) of the signature t to the drug i. The repositioning
proﬁle for drug i, vi , i ¼ 1; 2; . . . ; m, is deﬁned as

Off-Target Drug Repositioning Method for Cancer Therapy

Repositioning score
The identiﬁed repositioning proﬁle is applied to deﬁne a numerical value, called repositioning score, to distinguish the OTEs
of the drugs. We used a supervised regression model, support vector regression (SVR), to deﬁne the repositioning score. If a drug i is
approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration or undergoing clinical trials, the element of the label vector for prior
knowledge, Li, is equal to 1. SVR outputs a regression prediction vector, Ph, for each regression between repositioning proﬁle h ,
h ¼ 1; 2; . . . ; 1; 000, and the label vector, L. Ph is sorted in descending order. The drugs' ranks in the sorted Ph are recorded in a
repositioning score vector, <h . Thus, we have a sequence for repositioning score,


Q ¼ <1 ; <2 ; . . . ; <1;000

ðDÞ

The repositioning score for each drug is deﬁned as mean  standard variation across the 1,000 repositioning score vectors.
Off-targets and OTEs
The proposed repositioning score recognizes a drug's activity from the OTEs on the targetable signatures that comprise a
number of off-targets. The off-targets are identiﬁed as the CSB proteins whose OTEs are non-zero. For a drug i, its OTE on a CSB
protein j, j ¼ 1; 2; ::: ; n, in a targetable signature t, t 2 f1; 2; . . . ; kg, is deﬁned as the product of Aj;t and Lt;i . Thus, the the OTE of
drug i on the targetable signature t is a vector,

Work has been conducted to address the off-targets using
biomarkers or gene signatures (4, 12). Although gene signatures are able to identify which genes are changed during
treatment with a drug, they cannot explain the associations
between the expression changes of the genes and the OTEs on
these genes of the drug in terms of the pathway mechanism of
the disease. Moreover, these methods also fail to identify
frequently changed genes, which were not considered in the
gene signatures.
In this article, we present a new method of off-target drug
repositioning for cancer therapeutics based on transcriptional response. To include prior knowledge of signaling
pathways and cancer mechanisms into the off-target repositioning process, we propose the use of cancer-signaling
bridges (CSB) to connect signaling proteins to cancer proteins whose coding genes have a close relationship with
cancer genetic disorders and then integrate CSBs with a
powerful statistical regression model, the Bayesian factor
regression model (BFRM), to recognize the OTEs of drugs on
signaling proteins. The off-target repositioning method is
thus named as CSB-BFRM.
We applied CSB-BFRM to 3 cancer transcriptional response
proﬁles and found that CSB-BFRM accurately predicts the
activities of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)approved drugs and clinical trial drugs for the 3 cancer types.
Furthermore, we used the identiﬁed OTEs and off-targets to
explain the action of the repositioned drugs. Four known drugs,

each with 2 different doses, or 8 drug–dose pairs repositioned
to the MCF7 breast cancer cell line [raloxifene (0.1 and 7.8
mmol/L), tamoxifen (1 and 7 mmol/L), fulvestrant (1 and 0.01
mmol/L), and paclitaxel (4.6 and 1 mmol/L)] were investigated.
We showed that these drugs inhibit the transcription of certain
key cell-cycle genes by enhancing the retinoblastoma (Rb)dependent repression of E2F-mediated gene transcription.
They exhibited negative OTEs on the off-targets, the heterodimer E2F and DP-1, and the kinases CDK2 and CDK4/6, of Rb,
but positive OTEs on the inhibitors p15 and Skp, Cullin, F-box
containing complex (SCF) of the Rb's kinases. These results are
consistent with the dose–response curves derived from the
Developmental Therapeutics Program (DTP) of the National
Cancer Institute/National Institutes of Health (NCI/NIH).

Materials and Methods
The drug-treated transcriptional response data were derived
from Connectivity Map 02 (CMAP 02; ref. 4). There are 6,100
treatment instances, in which 6,066 instances were treated on 3
types of cancer cell lines: MCF7 breast cancer cell line, PC3
prostate cancer cell line, and HL60 promyelocytic leukemia cell
line. Each instance has a treatment case for 1 drug with 1
dosage and variable numbers of controls (1, 5, or 6). There are
3,095, 1,742, and 1,229 instances designed for MCF7, PC3, and
HL60 cell lines, respectively. The transcriptional response data

Figure 1 illustrates the strategies used in our off-target
repositioning method, CSB-BFRM, and the Quick Guide provides an overview of the key deﬁnitions and modeling
components.
Figure 1A shows the advantage of combining CSB and BFRM
(16–19) to reposition drugs that cater not only to the treatment–response but also to the expanded cancer signaling
mechanisms, making it feasible for off-target repositioning for
cancers. In Fig. 1B, the input to CSB-BFRM is a treatment–
response matrix X (n  m) whose m columns correspond to the

36

Cancer Res; 72(1) January 1, 2012

treated drugs and n rows correspond to the coding genes for
the identiﬁed CSB proteins for the cancer type of interest. The
statistical factor analysis, BFRM, decomposes the treatment–
response matrix X into another 2 matrices, weight matrix A
(n  k) and effect matrix L (k  m). A weight matrix, A (n  k),
is a sparse matrix (most of the elements are zero, as indicated
by white color) whose columns deﬁne k signatures and
their non-zero elements indicate which proteins are included
in the signatures. BFRM imposes a sparse prior on the association of the genes to the signatures. Another matrix,
P ¼ ðr1 ; r2 ; . . . ; rk Þ, contains the (sparse) probabilities that
each gene is associated with each factor. The cutoff point for
each element, Pi, j, of P matrix was chosen as the mean of all the
non-zero values in the P matrix. If Pi, j is higher than the cutoff
point, the corresponding value, Ai, j, of weight matrix A
will be kept, and else, Ai, j is set as zero. An effect matrix,
L (k  m), shows the effects of the m drugs imposed on the
k signatures. BFRM model applies hierarchical priors for
values of the non-zero elements in A and gets posterior via

Off-Target Drug Repositioning Method for Cancer Therapy

Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). MCMC analysis for
the posterior simulation is implemented in a Gibbs sampling manner. The BFRM model is implemented with a
software package, BFRM 2.0 (16, 17). The number of signatures, k, is determined by an evolution algorithm in the
BFRM 2.0 software.
In Fig. 1C, the repositioning proﬁle deﬁnition takes advantage of the identiﬁcation of the targetable signatures. If a drug's
target information is available, the targetable signatures are
deﬁned by the non-zero weights at the rows of the targets
across signatures of A. The proteins in each targetable signature are determined by the non-zero elements in each corresponding column of A. For each targetable signature, the total
of the non-zero weights is used to evaluate the response of the
signature to the drug. In L, the score corresponding to the row
of the signature and the column of the drug shows the effect of
the drug on the signature. The OTE that the drug imposes on
the signature is deﬁned as a weighted score obtained by
multiplying the response of the signature to the drug by the
effect of the drug on the signature. The repositioning proﬁle is
used to illustrate the OTEs of the drug on all of the signatures,
in which the OTEs for the targetable signatures are deﬁned as
the weighted scores, whereas those for the untargetable signatures are zeros.
Sometimes, the target information of a drug may be
unavailable. We designed a randomized process to ﬁnd
these targetable signatures. In the randomized process, a
number of proteins randomly chosen from the CSB proteins
were considered as the candidates for drug targets. The
hypothesis is that the drug generates OTEs on the CSB
proteins even if it does not target the CSB proteins directly.
The number of proteins chosen is determined by a random
numerical value drawn from a uniform distribution between
1 and m, where m is the mean value of the targets for the
drugs whose targets are known. The randomized process is
repeated 1,000 times for those drugs with unknown targets
to reduce the computational bias in the identiﬁcation of
their candidate targets or off-targets. Still, some drugs have
known drug targets that are not included in the CSB protein
set. These targets are led to the CSB proteins, using the
shortest paths in the protein–protein interaction network.
The CSB proteins identiﬁed are considered as the targets or
off-targets of these drugs.
To rank the activities of drugs, we propose a single
numerical value, repositioning score, for each drug. In this
study, because a number of drugs are known to be FDAapproved or undergoing clinical trials for breast cancer,
prostate cancer, and promyelocytic leukemia, we used the
supervised regression model to deﬁne the repositioning
score (Fig. 1D). For other cancer types, the FDA approval
and clinical trial information may be unavailable. To apply
the CSB-BFRM method to these cancer types, the supervised
method should be replaced by an unsupervised data mining
method, such as clustering. The SVR algorithm is implemented in R, using the package "e1071." All of the parameters
are used as default except that the parameter "c" for crossvalidation is set to be 5. We speciﬁed cross-validation as 5fold.

Results
CSBs expand the signaling proteins to cancer proteins
To investigate the off-target drug repositioning for cancers,
we introduced the new network elements, CSBs, that can be
used to extend the known canonical signaling pathways (13, 20)
to the proteins whose coding genes have a close relationship
with cancer genetic disorders (14, 21), or for short, cancer
proteins (Fig. 2A). The data sources for deﬁnition of CSBs are
listed in Supplementary Table S1. CSBs are the instances of
network motifs (15, 22, 23), or building blocks, of the protein
interaction networks (refs. 24–28; Supplementary Table S2).
Besides being able to link many previously unrelated cancer
proteins to a known signaling pathway of interest (Supplementary Fig. S1), CSBs have the following 4 characteristics that
determine their important role in off-target drug repositioning:
(i) CSBs are signiﬁcantly enriched in the connections between
oncogenic signaling pathways and cancer proteins (Supplementary Table S3 and Data); (ii) most CSBs, nearly 70%, are not
shared by multiple types of cancers but are speciﬁc to 1 cancer
type (Fig. 2B); (iii) signaling proteins and cancer proteins linked
by CSBs are signiﬁcantly more likely to be targeted by known
anticancer drugs (Fig. 2D); and (iv) although most known
anticancer drugs select the proteins in signaling pathways as
their targets (Fig. 2C), they still generate relatively high effects,
transmitted by CSBs, onto cancer proteins (Fig. 2E; Supplementary Data).
Application of CSB-BFRM to cancer transcriptional
response data
We applied the proposed off-target repositioning method,
CSB-BFRM, to 3 cancer transcriptional response data sets of
MCF7 breast cancer cell line, PC3 prostate cancer cell line, and
HL60 promyelocytic leukemia cell line (Supplementary Data).
The inputs and outputs of CSB-BFRM are shown in Supplementary Tables S4 to S12. We tested the performance of CSBBFRM to predict the activities of FDA-approved drugs and
drugs undergoing clinical trials for breast cancer, prostate
cancer, and promyelocytic leukemia and used the identiﬁed
off-targets and OTEs to explain the mechanisms of action of
repositioned drugs.
Performance of repositioning prediction
To evaluate the performance of CSB-BFRM in prediction
of drug activities based on the identiﬁed repositioning
proﬁles of drugs, we used the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) method. The area under the ROC curve (AUC)
illustrates how useful the repositioning proﬁles are for
prediction of the known data of FDA approval and clinical
trials information. In Fig. 3A and B, we show the ROC curves
for the predictions on the activities of FDA-approved and
clinical trial breast cancer drugs. The AUCs for the ROCs
in Fig. 3A are 0.94  0.02 (P < 104; Fisher exact 2-tailed test)
and those for the ROCs in Fig. 3B are 0.79  0.04 P < 104;

Fisher exact 2-tailed test). Because the FDA approval information for prostate cancer and promyelocytic leukemia is
limited (Supplementary Table S13), it was merged with
clinical trial information to do the repositioning predictions.
The performance of the prediction on the FDA-approved
and clinical trial prostate cancer drugs is indicated by the
ROC curve shown in Fig. 3C. The AUC of the ROC curve
in Fig. 3C is 0.78  0.03 (P < 104; Fisher exact 2-tailed test).
The ROC curve for the prediction on the FDA-approved and
clinical trial promyelocytic leukemia drugs is shown in Fig.
3D and its AUC is 0.91  0.06 (P < 104; Fisher exact 2-tailed
test). The results indicate that the activities of the FDAapproved and clinical trial drugs for breast cancer, prostate
cancer, and promyelocytic leukemia are accurately predicted
by the CSB-BFRM.
For the repositioning on the MCF7 breast cancer cell line,
we listed the ﬁrst 22 drugs with the highest repositioning
scores in Table 1 and showed the ranks for all the 1,390 drugs
in Supplementary Table S14. These ﬁrst 22 drugs predict all
14 FDA-approved drugs (with drug dosages) from the 1,390

have listed the repositioned drugs with their repositioning
scores for PC3 prostate cancer cell line and HL60 promyelocytic leukemia in Supplementary Tables S15 and S16. The
relatively small numbers of drugs with the highest repositioning scores predict the FDA-approved drugs and clinical
trial drugs for prostate cancer and promyelocytic leukemia

OTEs and off-targets
We investigated 8 pairs of drug doses with relatively high
repositioning scores repositioned for MCF7 breast cancer cell
line, as shown in Table 2. The 8 drug–dose pairs are raloxifene
at 0.1 and 7.8 mmol/L, tamoxifen at 1 and 7 mmol/L, paclitaxel at
4.6 and 1 mmol/L, and fulvestrant at 1 and 0.01 mmol/L. We
identiﬁed the off-targets for the 8 drug-dose pairs and listed
them with their OTEs in Supplementary Table S17. To
remove the redundant off-targets with relatively lower OTEs,
we used the mean of the absolute values, jOTEj, of all off-targets
as a threshold, d. We chose those off-targets whose OTEs
are higher than the threshold d or lower than d for the
following analysis. We conducted the gene set enrichment
analysis (GSEA; ref. 29) on the off-targets of each drug. The
off-targets of each drug are signiﬁcantly enriched in 2 important cellular functions, cell cycle (P < 105, hypergeometric
test) and apoptosis of cells (P < 1026, hypergeometric test).
The enrichment P values for all of the 8 drug-dose pairs are
shown in Supplementary Table S18. We also conducted pathway analysis on the identiﬁed off-targets, using Ingenuity
Pathway Analysis (IPA; Ingenuity Systems, Inc.) software.
Subsequently, 2 important signaling pathways related to cell
cycle and apoptosis were identiﬁed, namely, cell-cycle G1–S
checkpoint and p53 signaling pathways.

Mechanisms of repositioned drugs
The Rb-dependent repression of E2F-mediated transcription (30) is the key to understanding the mechanisms of the 8
repositioned drug–dose pairs. We summarized the signal
cascade as follows:

↔

INK4 −| CDK4/6

↔

SCF −| Cyclin D/E
CDK2

⎤
⎥
⎥
⎥ ⎯p⎯
→ Rb p −| Rb repression complex −| E2F ⇒ Cell cycle
⎥
DP-1
⎥
⎥
⎦

The OTEs and off-targets of the 8 repositioning drug–dose
pairs for this signaling cascade are shown in Table 2. To
better illustrate the drugs' effects on the signaling cascade,
their OTEs and off-targets are also displayed in Fig. 4. All 8
drug–dose pairs inhibit the core part of the signaling cascade, the heterodimer of E2F and DP-1. The inhibition of

either E2F or DP-1 ensures that the gene expression is
repressed even if Rb is phosphorylated. Still, some drug–
dose pairs targeting other parts of the signaling cascade
enforce the transcriptional repression. Paclitaxel at 4.6
mmol/L has a relatively high positive OTE (higher than 0)

on the RBL1 protein (a member of the Rb protein family),
which increases the expression of RBL1 protein and
strengthens the recruitment of histone deacetylases and
other nuclear factors to repress gene expression. Paclitaxel
at 4.6 mmol/L also has positive OTEs on the INK4 (p15) and
SCF (BTRC) proteins, which enhances the inhibition of

CDK4/6 and cyclin D/E as well as phosphorylation of Rb,
so that the association of Rb family members with both
histone deacetylases and E2Fs is enhanced and gene expression is repressed. Fulvestrant at 1 and 0.01 mmol/L have
negative OTEs (lower than 0) on the kinase CDK2 and
decrease its expression, which in turn, reduce the phosphorylated Rb and enhance the Rb-dependent repression of
E2F-mediated transcription. Thus, by various means, these
drugs enforce the transcriptional repression of key cell-cycle
genes.

Consistency with dose–response curves
We used the dose–response data derived from the DTP
of NCI/NIH (31) to validate our hypothesis. Checking the
dose–response curves for raloxifene, tamoxifen, paclitaxel,
and fulvestrant (Fig. 5), we found that all of the 4 drugs with
considered dosages (lower than 10 mmol/L) have a significant inhibition on cell growth. This result is consistent
with the predicted OTEs enhancing the Rb-dependent
repression of E2F-mediated transcription of the key genes
for cell-cycle progression.
The 4 repositioned drugs not only generate OTEs on the
cell-cycle G1–S checkpoint signaling pathway but also
impose OTEs on the p53 signaling pathway (Table 2
and Fig. 4). The OTEs on the p53 signaling pathway are
helpful to understand why raloxifene, tamoxifen, and pac-

40

Cancer Res; 72(1) January 1, 2012

litaxel induce apoptosis at higher dosages, whereas fulvestrant does not induce any cell death on MCF7 (Fig. 5). In a
comparison of the OTEs of raloxifene at lower and higher
dosages, these 2 OTEs appear to be opposite to each other.
At the lower dosage, the negative OTE decreases TP53 and
blocks apoptosis, whereas at the higher dosage it increases
apoptotic cell death. This is also seen with tamoxifen. On
the other hand, paclitaxel is predicted to increase the
expression of TP53 and induce apoptosis of cells at both
lower and higher dosages. Several experiments on paclitaxel
with dosages between 107 and 105 mol/L induce cell
death. In contrast, fulvestrant decreases the expression
of TP53 at both lower and higher dosages and cannot
induce the apoptosis of cells at any of the considered
dosages.

Discussion
In summary, we presented a new computational method
for off-target drug repositioning using cancer transcriptional
response data before and after treatment. Facilitated by
the new network elements, CSBs, we have shown the potential of the proposed method, CSB-BFRM, in the repositioning
of drugs for speciﬁc cancer types. CSB-BFRM performs well
in predicting the activities of FDA-approved drugs and
clinical trial drugs for breast cancer, prostate cancer, and

promyelocytic leukemia, using the corresponding transcription response datasets. The predicted OTEs and off-targets
help to better understand the mechanisms of action of
repositioned drugs.
In Table 1, the repositioning list for MCF7 breast cancer
cell line includes all of the FDA-approved breast cancer drugs
targeting the ER, which appear in the 1,390-drug set. The
drugs are raloxifene at 0.1 and 7.8 mmol/L, tamoxifen at 1
and 7 mmol/L, fulvestrant at 1 and 0.01 mmol/L, and estradiol
at 0.01 and 0.1 mmol/L. The repositioning result is consistent
with the fact that MCF7 is an ERþ breast cancer cell line. In
addition, raloxifene and tamoxifen are the selective ER
modulators (SERM; ref. 32). These SERMs function as
pure antagonists when acting through ER-b on genes containing estrogen response elements but can function as
partial agonists when acting on them through ER-a. The
repositioning results for raloxifene and tamoxifen are consistent with the "partial agonist" property of raloxifene
and tamoxifen. These 2 drugs generate higher effects at
lower dosages. Raloxifene at 0.1 mmol/L has a higher repositioning rank than raloxifene at 7.8 mmol/L, and tamoxifen
at 1 mmol/L has a higher repositioning rank than tamoxifen
at 7 mmol/L.
The identiﬁed off-targets and OTEs display the complexity of
the drugs' activities. On one hand, some drugs at higher
dosages have their own speciﬁc off-targets or OTEs. In the
repositioning for the MCF7 breast cancer cell line, paclitaxel at
4.6 mmol/L has extra positive OTEs on the RBL1 protein, Rb's
kinase (CDK2), the cyclin proteins' inhibitor (SCF), and the
inhibitor of kinase CDK4/6, INK4 (p15), which are absent at the
lower dosage. These OTEs ensure that paclitaxel can strengthen the transcription repression on the key genes regulating the
cell cycle. On the other hand, at different dosages, the same
drug would generate different effects on its speciﬁc off-targets
and signaling pathways. For example, at the higher dosages,
raloxifene and tamoxifen have positive OTEs on p53 protein
while exhibiting negative OTEs on p53 protein at the lower
dosages. Because the complexity of the drugs' activities is not
easily explained by "on-target" studies, the OTEs on the downstream signaling proteins have to be identiﬁed and linked to
transcription, rather than simple analysis of the effects on
known drug targets.
BFRM plays a central role in recognizing the OTEs of
repositioned drugs. It factorizes the response (fold change of
expression) of a molecule into different component values
according to the latent factors (signatures). The CSB-BFRM
recognizes the essential latent factors (targetable signatures) and factorized component values (OTEs) for these
signatures. For the repositioning on the MCF7 breast cancer
cell line, we compared the original response (fold change) on
off-targets in cell-cycle G1–S checkpoint and p53 signaling
pathways with the recognized OTEs on these targets (Supplementary Fig. S2). The data scale is changed. Fold changes
of the molecules are between 0.4 and 1.6, whereas OTEs are
between 0.10 and 0.10. The factorized OTEs allow easy
recognition of positive and negative effects. For instance, all
of the original fold changes of tamoxifen at 1 mmol/L are
higher than 1, whereas the OTEs are between 0.05 and 0.05.

of interest. However, CSB-BFRM would face difﬁculties in
repositioning drugs for rare cancer types, as prior knowledge
is often unavailable. Fortunately, with the rapid development of next-generation sequencing, more people will be
willing to study these rare cancer types and to generate
corresponding genetic mutation data. The identiﬁcation of
key genes with genetic disorders would allow further identiﬁcation of CSBs for these cancer types. Thus, we believe
that using CSB-BFRM for repositioning drugs for rare cancer
types will also be feasible.

If we use the original fold changes, we cannot tell the
difference between OTEs on the heterodimer of E2F and
DP-1 (negative) and those for p53 (positive). The recognized
OTEs are better in reﬂecting the mechanism of action of
repositioned drugs.
The proposed off-target drug repositioning method, CSBBFRM, takes advantage of the availability of disease-speciﬁc
prior knowledge. For example, the deﬁnition of CSBs as
shown in Fig. 1 requires prior knowledge of the cancer genes
that have genetic disorders associated with the cancer type
