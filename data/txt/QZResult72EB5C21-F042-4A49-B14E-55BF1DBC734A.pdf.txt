Abstract
Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is an Epstein-Barr virus–associated malignancy most common in East Asia
and Africa. Aberrant expression of Jab1/CSN5, a negative regulator of the cell-cycle inhibitor p27, is correlated
with reduced p27 expression and associated with advanced tumor stage and poor prognosis in several human
cancers. In this study, we examined the functional relationship between Jab1 and p27 protein expression in NPC.
Immunohistochemical analysis showed an inverse association between Jab1 and p27 in NPC tissue samples, and
overexpression of Jab1 correlated with poor survival in patients with NPC. Mechanistically, Jab1 and p27 were
found to interact directly in NPC cells, with Jab1 mediating p27 degradation in a proteasome-dependent manner.
Knockdown of Jab1 resulted in a remarkable increase in p27 levels and inhibition of cell proliferation, indicating
that Jab1 targets p27 for degradation, thereby controlling its stability. Jab1 depletion also enhanced the antitumor
effects of cisplatin in NPC cells. Together, our ﬁndings suggest that Jab1 overexpression plays an important role in
the pathogenesis of NPC through Jab1-mediated p27 degradation. Jab1 therefore represents a novel diagnostic
marker and therapeutic target in patients with NPC. Cancer Res; 72(7); 1890–900. 2012 AACR.

Introduction
Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), originating from the
epithelial lining of the nasopharynx, is a squamous cell carcinoma (1). This neoplasm has remarkable ethnic and geographic distribution, with a high prevalence in southern China,
Southeast Asia, Northern Africa, and Alaska (2, 3). The annual
incidence peaks at 50 cases per 100,000 people in the endemic
regions but is rare in the Western world (1 per 100,000; ref. 2).
Etiologic studies have indicated that Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)
infection, environmental factors, and genetic susceptibility are
associated with NPC (1, 4). In China, more than 95% of NPCs
are nonkeratinizing carcinoma, whereas less than 5% are

keratinizing carcinoma; thus, in our study, we use CNE1
(keratinizing carcinoma) and CNE2 (nonkeratinizing carcinoma) cells to represent the 2 main histologic types (5).
Radiotherapy and adjuvant cisplatin chemotherapy have
become the standard treatments for NPC (6). The 5-year
survival rate after treatment is approximately 70% (7). Thirty
to forty percent of patients will develop distant metastasis
within 4 years (8), and once metastasis occurs, the prognosis is
very poor.
To develop better treatment approaches, it is important to
understand the molecular basis of the development and progression of NPC. Genetic alterations have been reported in
NPCs including a frequent reduction of p27 expression (9, 10).
Furthermore, low p27 expression levels may contribute to the
aggressive behavior of NPCs (11). Overexpression of cyclin E
mRNA has been shown to predict poor prognosis in NPC and
has been correlated with an advanced stage of NPC and a low
overall survival rate (12). Recently, it has been reported that
PIK3CA gene ampliﬁcation is frequently observed in advancedstage NPC, which emphasizes the association between PIK3CA
gene ampliﬁcation and poor prognosis (11). It has also been
shown that Akt promotes cell proliferation and survival in
NPCs (4, 13). However, additional molecular abnormalities
resulting in the deregulation of cell-cycle progression may also
occur.
Jab1/CSN5 (Jab1 hereafter), as we initially identiﬁed as a cJun coactivator, is also known as the ﬁfth component of the
COP9 signalosome (CSN) complex (CSN5; refs. 14, 15). Jab1
promotes cell proliferation and inactivates p27 by inducing
translocation of p27 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, which
accelerates p27 degradation through the ubiquitin-dependent
proteasome pathway and promotes cell-cycle progression (16).

Jab1 Expression Is Associated with Poor Prognosis in NPC

p27 is a universal cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) inhibitor that
directly inhibits the enzymatic activity of cyclin–Cdk complexes, resulting in cell-cycle arrest at G1 (17). In addition, p27
protein levels are increased in quiescent cells and rapidly
decrease after cells are stimulated with mitogens (18).
Although transcriptional regulation is possible, the cellular
abundance of p27 is primarily regulated at the posttranslational level by the ubiquitin–proteasome pathway (19). Jab1
overexpression is correlated with a loss of p27 and a lower
rate of survival in patients with breast cancer, suggesting a
role in breast cancer pathogenesis (20). This inverse association between Jab1 and p27 expression has also been
observed in anaplastic large cell lymphoma (21), ovarian
cancer (22), pancreatic adenocarcinomas (23, 24), and other
cancer types (25–27). However, the mechanisms leading to
p27 downregulation in NPCs remain undeﬁned. Because Jab1
overexpression is correlated with the loss of p27 in several
cancers and low p27 expression is associated with higher
tumor grades (28), we hypothesized that Jab1 functions as a
negative regulator of p27 and as such may play a role in the
pathogenesis of NPCs.
To test our hypothesis, we assessed Jab1 and p27 expression
in a series of 45 NPC and 30 nasopharyngeal inﬂammation
tissue specimens. We found that Jab1 overexpression was
associated with no or low expression of p27 in these samples.
To further elucidate the role of Jab1 in p27 degradation in
NPCs, we infected NPC cell lines with an adenoviral vector
overexpressing Jab1 and found that p27 levels were signiﬁcantly reduced. We also detected a direct physical interaction between Jab1 and p27 in NPC cells. Furthermore,
inhibition of endogenous Jab1 expression with speciﬁc
siRNAs resulted in a substantial increase of p27 levels and
inhibition of cell proliferation, indicating that Jab1 controls the
stability of p27 by targeting it for degradation in NPCs. Interestingly, siRNA-mediated depletion of Jab1 inhibited cell proliferation and enhanced the antitumor effects of cisplatin in
NPC cells. This may suggest that Jab1 is a potential target for
treating NPCs.

Materials and Methods
Patients and tissue samples
All patients were from the Cancer Center of Sun Yat-Sen
University (Guangzhou, Guangdong, PR China) in 2003. The
study group consisted of 36 men and 9 women with NPC who
underwent radiotherapy and the control group consisted of
13 men and 17 women with nasopharyngeal inﬂammation.
Patients who had preoperative diagnosis and did not receive
preoperative chemoradiation treatment were selected for
this study on the basis of the availability of archived parafﬁn-embedded NPCs and nasopharyngitis tissue blocks for
immunohistochemical analysis. Ethical approval was
obtained from the cancer center and fully informed consent
from all patients before sample collection. Surgical staging of
tumors had been done according to the American Joint
Committee on Cancer tumor-node-metastasis system and
tumor grading was based on currently used histopathologic
criteria.

Reagents
Cell culture medium was from Mediatech Inc. and FBS was
obtained from Gibco. The antibodies used were Jab1 (Santa
Cruz); p27 and PARP (BD Biosciences PharMingen); caspase-3,
lamin A/C, and Myc-tag (Cell Signaling Technology; and Flag
and b-actin (Sigma-Aldrich). The Lipofectamine Plus and
Oligofectamine reagents were from Invitrogen. NE-PER nuclear and cytoplasmic extraction reagents and Western Lightning
Chemiluminescence Plus reagent were from Thermo Scientiﬁc
Pierce. Annexin V/PI kit was from BD Biosciences. Cell Proliferation Kit was from Roche.
Human tissues and immunohistochemical analysis
A total of 75 formalin-ﬁxed, parafﬁn-embedded human
primary NPCs and noncancerous inﬂamed nasopharyngeal
specimens from 45 patients with NPC and 30 patients with
nasopharyngitis were analyzed. The p27 and Jab1 levels in the
formalin-ﬁxed, parafﬁn-embedded tissue sections were measured by immunohistochemical analysis, as previously
described (24). Brieﬂy, heat-induced retrieval of Jab1 and
p27 antigens was conducted, and the slides were incubated
with the primary antibodies. An immunoreaction was detected
with the LSABþ kit from DakoCytomation. We used 3,30 diaminobenzidine as the chromogen and hematoxylin as the
counterstain. Expression levels of Jab1 and p27 were evaluated
by counting at least 500 tumor cells in representative highpower ﬁelds. Tumor cells were considered positive for Jab1 or
p27 when nuclear or cytoplasmic staining was present. For
each tumor, we determined a proportion score and an intensity
score. The proportion score represented the estimated fraction
of positively stained cells (0, <5%; 1, 5%–35%; 2, 35%–65%; and
3, >65%). The intensity score represented the estimated average staining intensity of the positive cells (0, no staining; 1,
weak staining; 2, intermediate staining; and 3, strong staining).
The overall amount of protein present in each tumor was then
expressed as the average of the proportion and intensity scores
for negative and positive cells (ranges, 0 and 0.5–3, respectively). We deﬁned the scores 0, 0.5 to 1.0, 1.5 to 2.0, and 2.5 to 3.0 as
negative (), weakly positive (þ), and highly positive [(þþ),
(þþþ)], respectively.
Cell cultures
Human NPC cell lines CNE1 (well-differentiated, from
Cancer Center, Sun Yat-Sen University), CNE2 (poorly differentiated, from Cancer Center, Sun Yat-Sen University),
HONE1 (poorly differentiated, the generous gift of Prof.
Ronald Glaser, The Ohio State University Medical Center,
Columbus, OH), and C666.1 (undifferentiated, the generous
gift of Prof. Kwok-Wai Lo, Prince of Wales Hospital, The
Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, N.T., Hong Kong)
were cultured in RPMI medium containing 10% FBS and
penicillin–streptomycin sulfate. 293T human embryonic kidney cells were cultured in Dulbecco's Modiﬁed Eagle's Medium (Invitrogen) with 10% FBS and penicillin–streptomycin.
HOK16B (normal keratinocyte cells, the generous gift of Prof.
Jeffrey N. Myers, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX)

penicillin–streptomycin sulfate. All cell lines were incubated
at 37 C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2.
Cell extracts and immunoblotting
Cells in the log phase of growth were collected, washed twice
in cold PBS, and lysed as described previously (29). Nuclear
fractions of the indicated cell lysates were separated with NEPER nuclear and cytoplasmic extraction reagents according to
the manufacturer's directions. Proteins were separated by 10%
SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and
probed with anti-Jab1, anti-p27, anti-Myc, anti-PARP, and
anti-caspase-3. b-Actin was used as the internal positive control for all immunoblots. Immunoreactive bands were detected
with horseradish peroxidase–conjugated secondary antibodies
with the Western Lightning Chemiluminescence Plus Reagent.
The protein levels were quantiﬁed by ImageJ software (NIH,
Bethesda, MD; http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij). Activity of PARP and
caspase-3 was measured as percentage of cleavage band
intensity to the total bands and calculated as follows: % PARP
or caspase-3 ¼ 100%  Tc/Tt, where Tc is the intensity value of
the cleavage bands and Tt is the intensity value of the total
bands.
Adenoviral vectors and gene transduction
A recombinant adenoviral vector expressing a doxycyclineregulated (Tet-Off) form of human Jab1 (Ad-Myc-Jab1) was
constructed, as previously described (24). NPC cells were
transduced for 48 hours with a regulatory virus (adeno-X
Tet-Off, Clontech) and Ad-Myc-Jab1 at a multiplicity of infection of 50 in a growth medium containing 10% FBS in the
presence or absence of 1 mg/mL doxycycline, a tetracycline
analogue.
Proteasome inhibition assays
NPC cells were treated with the proteasome inhibitors LLnL
(35 mmol/L) or MG132 (30 mmol/L), or LLM (25 mmol/L), and
dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as a control. After 16 hours of
treatment, the cells were harvested, whole-cell lysates were
prepared, and immunoblotting was done with antibodies
against p27. b-Actin antibodies were used as a loading control.
NPC cells were transduced with Ad-Myc-Jab1 as described
earlier. Thirty-two hours after infection, proteasome inhibitors
(LLnL or MG132 or LLM) or DMSO (control) were added to the
medium for 16 hours. Forty-eight hours after infection, wholecell lysates were prepared, and proteins were analyzed by
immunoblotting.
siRNA, DNA transfection, and coimmunoprecipitation
assays
For the siRNA analysis, Jab1 siRNA and control siRNA
oligonucleotides were cloned into an RNAi vector (BD Biosciences PharMingen) according to the manufacturer's instructions and as described by Kouvaraki and colleagues (24). The
Myc-Jab1 and Flag-p27, GFP-Jab1, and Cherry-p27 plasmids
were transfected into either 293T or CNE1 cells with the
Lipofectamine Plus reagent, and cells were either lysed for
coimmunoprecipitation assays or examined with a ﬂuorescence microscope.

Coimmunoprecipitation assays were done with the wholecell lysates from NPC cells or DNA-transfected 293T cells, as
described earlier (24). Brieﬂy, cell lysates were incubated in
radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer for 4 hours at
4 C with either anti-Myc or anti-Jab1 antibodies or nonimmune mouse serum as a control. Proteins were separated by
12% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and
analyzed by immunoblotting.
Cell proliferation assay
The MTT assay was used to evaluate cell viability, as described previously (29). Brieﬂy, 48 hours after transfection,
NPC cells were seeded in 96-well plates (500 cells per well for
growth curves or 2,000 cells per well for cisplatin treatment)
in 100 mL of RPMI-1640 medium with 8% FBS. After the
indicated incubation period, the MTT labeling reagent (ﬁnal
concentration, 0.5 mg/mL) was added, and the spectrophotometric absorbance of the samples was read with a microplate (ELISA) reader at 570 nm. The ratios (%) of cell survival
or colony formation were calculated as the ratio of the
indicated treatment group to the control group as follows:
% survival ratio ¼ 100%  Nt/Nc, and % inhibition ratio ¼
100%  (1Nt/Nc), where Nt is the optical density (OD) value
(colony number) of the treatment group and Nc is the OD
value (colony number) of control group.
Colony formation assay
Forty-eight hours after transfection, NPC cells (200 cells
per well) were plated in 6-well plates for growth analysis in
RPMI-1640 medium with 8% FBS. The following day, the cells
were treated with 0 or 0.5 mmol/L cisplatin for 48 hours. After
10 days, the cells were ﬁxed with methanol, stained with 0.1%
crystal violet, and scored by counting with an inverted

All computations were carried out with SPSS 16.0 (SPSS)

Patient characteristics and demographics
To analyze the Jab1 and p27 expression patterns, we used 45
NPC tissue samples (median age, 41; range, 20–73 years) and 30
nasopharyngeal inﬂammation tissue samples (median age, 36;
range, 14–65 years). The clinicopathologic characteristics of
the patients with NPC are summarized in Table 1.

in cytoplasmic and 16% in nuclear, respectively, P < 0.01 (Fig.
1A). In contrast, nuclear p27 level was higher in noncancerous
inﬂamed nasopharyngeal tissues (67%) than that in the NPC
tissues (58%). However, 64% cytoplasmic p27 staining was
observed in NPC cases, which was higher than that in noncancerous tissue (37%), p < 0.05 (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, cytoplasmic Jab1 expression in NPC tissues was inversely associated with nuclear p27 patterns (R ¼ 0.389, p ¼ 0.008) and
correlated with cytoplasm p27 (R ¼ 0.328, P ¼ 0.028; Fig. 1C).

Jab1 speciﬁcally interacts with p27
To determine whether Jab1 and p27 directly interact,
we conducted coimmunoprecipitation analyses. Lysates
were immunoprecipitated with anti-Jab1 antibodies and
immunoblotted with anti-p27 antibodies (Fig. 3A). We
found that endogenous Jab1 indeed interacts with p27
(Fig. 3A). This interaction was speciﬁc because the Jab1containing lysates were not immunoprecipitated with
nonimmune rabbit serum. To conﬁrm these results, we
examined the ectopic Jab1 and p27 interactions by transfecting Myc-Jab1 and Flag-p27 plasmids into 293T cells.
As expected, Myc-Jab1 binds to Flag-p27 (Fig. 3B). Moreover, data showed most p27 in a predominantly nuclear
location when Cherry-p27 was transfected into CNE1 cells,
but both nuclear and cytoplasmic staining were seen when
GFP-Jab1 was induced (Fig. 3C and Supplementary Fig. S3).
These data strongly indicate that Jab1 associates with p27
in NPC cells.

Jab1 promotes p27 degradation through proteolysis and
is sensitive to proteasome inhibitors
Immunoblotting also showed strong Jab1 expression in
NPC cells but not normal keratinocyte cells, where weak Jab1
expression was detected (Fig. 2A). Treatment of NPC cells
with speciﬁc proteasome inhibitors resulted in a signiﬁcant
increase in total p27 levels (Fig. 2B). To investigate whether
Jab1 overexpression in NPC cells downregulates p27 levels,
we transduced those 4 cell lines with Jab1 adenovirus in the
absence or presence of doxycycline and measured Myc-Jab
and p27 levels 48 hours after infection. Using this inducible
(Tet-Off) system, Jab1 overexpression led to a signiﬁcant
decrease in p27 levels in all cell lines tested (Fig. 2C).
Downregulation of p27 mediated by Jab1 overexpression
was inhibited in cells that had been treated with proteasome inhibitors (LLnL, MG132, and LLM) but not in those
treated with DMSO (Fig. 2D), indicating that Jab1 promotes
p27 degradation through proteolysis and is sensitive to
proteasome inhibitors. These data provide direct evidence
of a functional relationship between Jab1 and p27 in NPC
cells.

cycle. In CNE1 cells, 24% of the control siRNA-transfected
cells were in the S-phase compared with 37% of cells in
the G1 phase, and 14% of the Jab1 siRNA–transfected cells
were in the S-phase compared with 47% of cells in the G1 phase
(Fig. 4B). Similar results were obtained from CNE2 cells (25%
in S-phase and 37% in G1 phase for control cells vs. 18% in
S-phase and 42% in G1 phase for Jab1 siRNA–transfected cells)
and HONE1 cells (33% in S-phase and 28% in G1 phase for
control cells vs. 22% in S-phase and 42% in G1 phase for Jab1
siRNA–transfected cells). To conﬁrm the above conclusion,
we next conducted a coimmunoprecipitation experiment
to measure the amount of p27–cyclin E–Cdk2 inhibitory
complex formation. As shown in Fig. 4C, p27 levels in Jab1
knockdown cells were higher when immunoprecipitated with
Cdk2, indicating more complex formation. These data suggest
that downregulation of Jab1 induces stabilization of p27,
therefore increasing p27 levels and activity.

To investigate whether downregulation of Jab1 was involved
in growth suppression, we ﬁrst analyzed whether the siRNAmediated Jab1 inhibition could recapitulate the tumor suppressor effect in NPC cell lines. The expression levels of Jab1
protein in Jab1 siRNA–transfected NPC cells were signiﬁcantly
less than those in the control siRNA-transfected cells (Fig. 4A).
Moreover, the siRNA-mediated Jab1 knockdown also signiﬁcantly inhibited the in vitro growth and colony formation of
NPC cells (Fig. 5A and B). Notably, the growth-inhibitory effects
of the Jab1 siRNA knockdown suggest that Jab1 targeting is a
mechanism of tumor suppression in NPC cells. In addition, we
tested the effect of knocking down Jab1 on apoptosis. Fortyeight hours after the siRNA was transfected, we used Annexin V
and PI staining (Fig. 5C) or analysis of cleaved PARP and
caspase-3 (Fig. 5D). However, there was no signiﬁcant difference between the control and Jab1 siRNA–treated groups; thus,
we cannot conclude that Jab1 knockdown initiates apoptosis
under these conditions.

Jab1 depletion enhances the antitumor effects of
cisplatin in NPC
Because cisplatin is the main treatment of NPC, we proposed
to investigate that Jab1 may be involved in the antitumor
effects of cisplatin. We ﬁrst tested whether the inhibition of
Jab1 enhances the antitumor effects of cisplatin by MTT assay.
Data showed that 21%, 18%, and 7% of CNE1, CNE2, and
HONE1 cells treated with control siRNA and cisplatin were
inhibited, whereas, 38%, 38%, and 26% cells were inhibited by
Jab1 siRNA and cisplatin, suggesting that Jab1-knockdown
NPC cells were more sensitive to cisplatin than cells treated
with control siRNA (Fig. 6A). To test whether Jab1 plays a role
in anchorage-independent growth in response to cisplatin,

which may reﬂect in vivo tumorigenicity, we conducted a
colony formation assay in NPC cells treated with Jab1 siRNA
and cisplatin. We found that the Jab1-knockdown cells had
signiﬁcant inhibition of colony formation (73% in CNE1, 90% in
CNE2, and 66% in HONE1) compared with the control siRNAtreated cells (22% in CNE1, 60% in CNE2, and 14% in HONE1) in
response to cisplatin (Fig. 6B).
We further examined whether Jab1 knockdown could
enhance cisplatin-induced apoptosis in NPC cells. We found
that cisplatin induced more apoptosis in Jab1-knockdown cells
than that in control siRNA-treated cells, which is 1.4-fold in
CNE1 and 4.7-fold in CNE2, respectively (Fig. 6C), when using
Annexin V and PI staining, and 1.6-fold in CNE1 and 3.2-fold in

Discussion
The molecular basis of NPC pathogenesis remains poorly
deﬁned, and this has hindered the development of new treatments. Therefore, identiﬁcation of novel mechanisms involved
in NPC oncogenesis is needed.
In this study, we identiﬁed the role of Jab1-mediated p27
degradation in NPC oncogenesis. First, we found that Jab1 was
aberrantly expressed in either cytoplasm or nucleus NPC
tissues compared with noncancerous inﬂamed nasopharyngeal tissue. All (14 of 14) strong Jab1-positive patients died
within 41 months whereas 11 of 31 weak or Jab1-negative
patients were alive after 60 months. We also showed that Jab1
protein is overexpressed in NPC cell lines but not in paired
normal keratinocyte cells. Our ﬁndings on p27 expression also
conﬁrm those of previous reports. For instance, Hwang and
colleagues (11) reported that in patients with NPC, 47 of 69
cases expressed low levels of p27. In our study, 29 of 45 NPC
cases (64%) expressed low or no nuclear p27, and 28 cases
(62%) expressed low or no cytoplasmic p27. In addition, the
nuclear cytoplasmic translocation of p27 has been observed in
human tumors and is associated with poor survival (30–33), it
was in agreement with our studies that patients with NPC with
cytoplasmic-positive p27 had a poor survival.
Furthermore, cytoplasmic Jab1 expression in NPC tissues
was inversely associated with nuclear p27 patterns (R ¼
0.389, p ¼ 0.008) and correlated with cytoplasm p27 (R ¼
0.328, P ¼ 0.028). Our ﬁnding of an inverse correlation between
Jab1 and p27 expression levels in NPC is in agreement with our
previously published results on breast cancer and pancreatic
carcinomas (20, 24) and similar associations reported in other
epithelial or lymphoid malignancies (21, 22). This suggests that
Jab1 has a physiologic role in controlling p27 levels in NPCs. To
our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst study on the expression and
function of Jab1 in NPCs to be reported.
Jab1 promotes cell proliferation by interacting directly
with p27 and induces nuclear export and subsequent p27
degradation (34). p27 is a critical component of the cell-cycle
machinery (16). As an inhibitor of cyclin E–Cdk2, p27 plays a
pivotal role in controlling cell proliferation and therefore the
cell's entry into S-phase and exit from G1 phase during
development and tumorigenesis (18, 35). We infected NPC
cell lines with an inducible Jab1-expressing adenoviral vector
and found that p27 levels were signiﬁcantly reduced. These
results are in agreement with those we previously obtained in
breast cancer and pancreatic cell lines (20, 24). Furthermore,
knockdown of endogenous Jab1 expression with siRNA in

NPC cell lines led to a signiﬁcant increase in total p27 levels
and nuclear accumulation of p27 in the nucleus and p27–
cyclin E–Cdk2 complex, substantial decreases in the number
of S-phase cells, and increases in the number of G1 phase
cells. In addition, a direct p27–Jab1 interaction was conﬁrmed by coimmunoprecipitation assays and ﬂuorescent
microscopy. These results provide additional evidence that
Jab1 controls p27 levels posttranslationally by accelerating
p27 degradation in NPCs.
We also showed that loss of Jab1 resulted in growth inhibition in NPC cell lines. Similarly, a study by Supriatno and
colleagues (36) showed that suppression of Jab1 inhibited the
growth of human head and neck cancer cells (HNt and HSY
cells) and delayed tumor growth in murine xenografts. It
suggests that strong expression of Jab1 not only represents
a prognostic marker for malignant transformation but also
contributes to cancer cell proliferation and survival. Furthermore, we found that knockdown of Jab1 sensitized NPC cells to
cisplatin chemotherapy. Jab1 siRNA–treated cells were more
susceptible to apoptotic stimuli than the control siRNA-treated cells. Taken together, the data implicate Jab1 as a potential
biomarker and further suggest exploration of whether decreasing Jab1 levels or function would overcome resistance to
cisplatin chemotherapy in NPCs. The signiﬁcance of these
functions of Jab1 in NPCs needs to be explored in future
mechanistic studies.
Overall, we found Jab1 to be overexpressed and inversely
correlated with p27 expression levels in NPC. Jab1 overexpression associated with low p27 levels or other factors may
contribute to uncontrolled cell-cycle progression and tumorigenesis. Depletion of Jab1 by siRNA, which leads to inhibition
of proliferation, enhanced cisplatin activity in NPC. Therefore,
modulation of the Jab1 gene product is a novel target for
therapies in NPCs.
