Abstract
Although epidemiologic studies have linked arsenic exposure
to the development of human cancer, the mechanisms
underlying the tumorigenic role of arsenic remain largely
undefined. We report here that treatment of cells with sodium
arsenite at the concentrations close to environmental exposure is associated with the up-regulation of Hdm2 and the
accumulation of p53 in the cytoplasm. Through the mitogenactivated protein kinase pathway, arsenite stimulates the P2
promoter–mediated expression of Hdm2, which then promotes p53 nuclear export. As a consequence, the p53 response
to genotoxic stress is compromised, as evidenced by the
impaired p53 activation and apoptosis in response to UV
irradiation or 5FU treatment. The ability of arsenite to impede
p53 activation is further demonstrated by a significantly
blunted p53-dependent tissue response to 5FU treatment when
mice were fed with arsenite-containing water. Together, our
data suggests that arsenic compounds predispose cells to
malignant transformation by up-regulation of Hdm2 and
subsequent p53 inactivation. [Cancer Res 2008;68(22):9131–6]

Introduction
Exposure to arsenic is a major public health concern throughout
the world. Whether the source is naturally occurring deposits or
industrial and agricultural runoff, the primary route of human
exposure is contaminated ground water. Long-term arsenic
exposure is associated with increased risks of numerous human
cancers (1, 2), and so, arsenic has been classified as a human
carcinogen by both the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency4 and
the IARC.5 Although this classification is based on the results of
multiple epidemiologic studies, there is still debate as to whether
arsenic is a carcinogen by itself, or instead, only acts synergistically
to predispose cells to transformation by complete carcinogens.
This controversy is due in part to a lack of consistent success in
inducing cancer in animal models through arsenic exposure (3).
Some researchers have been able to show arsenic-mediated
transformation in certain cells and assays (4–6), but again, the
data are not completely consistent and other results merely show
hyperproliferation (7) or survival (8, 9). Arsenic is at least well
accepted as a cocarcinogen (10).

Available data showing the effects of arsenic on p53 are often
conflicting. Although high concentrations of arsenic compounds
almost always induce an increase in p53 protein levels as well as
activity, lower concentrations yield various results dependent on
concentration, compound, duration of treatment, and cell type
(10, 12). Because p53 almost likely is functionally inactivated before
a cell can undergo transformation, the present study aimed to
determine how the low level of arsenic affects the p53 response in
nontransformed human cells and in mice.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture and transfection. MCF-10A (American Type Culture
Collection), keratinocytes and p53 / mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs)
were cultured as described (13). Cells were transfected with Lipofectamine
2000 (Invitrogen) according to the instructions of the manufacturer.
Preparation of whole-cell extracts and Western blotting. Preparation
of whole-cell lysates and Western blot analysis have been previously
described (13). Samples were boiled in the loading dye and resolved by SDSPAGE. Proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes and probed
with the indicated antibodies: anti-p53 (Ab-6; Calbiochem), anti-Flag (M5;
Sigma), anti–h-actin (AC-15; Sigma), anti-MDM2 (Ab-1, Ab-3 Oncogene),
and anti-pS15p53 (Cell Signaling). Proteins were visualized with an
enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (NEN).
Subcellular distribution assay. Cells were grown on coverslips, treated,
and followed by 12 h of incubation with sodium arsenite or mock treatment,
fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, and stained as described (13). Slides were
mounted with Fluoromount-G (Southern Biotechnology Associates). Specimens were examined under a fluorescent microscope (Zeiss).
Mice studies. C57BL/6 mice at age of 12 weeks were fed with water with
or without sodium arsenite (1.0 mg/L) for 3 days. 5-Fluoroucil (5FU; 30 mg/
kg) was then administered i.v. Animals were sacrificed 12 h later and wholebody perfusion with 4% paraformaldehyde was performed. Cryosections
(10 Am) were prepared on harvested organs and stained with standard
procedures.

Results
In the United States, the current maximum contaminant level for
arsenic in drinking water is 10 Ag/L, which is equal to f0.5 Amol/L
of arsenic. A 0.5 or 1.0 Amol/L concentration of arsenic was used
for long-term treatment of cells. In light of the fact that
concentrations of arsenic in certain areas may be much higher,
and in addition, arsenic compounds accumulate within the body
upon repeated exposure (14). A higher concentration of arsenic
(10 Amol/L) was selected for a short exposure (12 hours or less),
which is comparable to a dose achievable through prolonged

exposure to arsenic in contaminated drinking water. We chose
untransformed human mammary epithelial cell line MCF-10A cells
and TERT-immortalized human keratinocytes in this study for
assessing the p53 response. MCF-10A cells were treated for
12 hours with 10 Amol/L of sodium arsenite. 5FU, a DNA-damaging
agent able to activate p53, was included as a control. As expected,
MCF-10A cells responded to 5FU by marked elevation of p53
abundance and induction of Hdm2 (Fig. 1A, left, lane 3).
Interestingly, whereas arsenic treatment was associated with an
increase in Hdm2, there was no noticeable change in the p53
protein level (Fig. 1A, left, lane 2). Considering the possibility that
the p53 protein can, under certain circumstances, be activated by
phosphorylation without a significant increase in protein abundance, we examined serine 15 phosphorylation, a well-documented
biochemical marker for stress-induced p53 activation (15). Probing
the membrane with an anti-pS15p53 antibody revealed that this
residue was heavily phosphorylated in 5FU-treated cells, whereas
no such phosphorylation was detectable in arsenic-treated cells
(Fig. 1A, left, lane 2). A similar result was also seen in keratinocytes
(Fig. 1A, right). Together, it seems that contrary to 5FU, arsenic
treatment resulted in the up-regulation of Hdm2 without apparent
p53 activation.
Although Hdm2 is a well-documented gene controlled by p53, its
expression can also be regulated by mechanisms independent of
p53. The apparent discrepancy of Hdm2 up-regulation without
accompanying p53 activation in arsenic-treated cells prompted
us to test a p53-independent mode of regulation. We assessed the
effect of arsenic in p53-null MEFs. Indeed, the results confirmed

a p53-independent mechanism, as evidenced by a marked upregulation of Hdm2 levels in arsenic-treated p53-null cells
(Fig. 1B, left). To substantiate these results, we determined the
effects of arsenic on the Hdm2 mRNA level. There are two welldefined promoters, P1 and P2, that control the expression of Hdm2
(Fig. 1C), of which P1 is independent and P2 can be either
dependent or independent of p53 (15). Primers corresponding to
the sequences of each promoter were generated for probing Hdm2
mRNAs. Arsenic treatment induced the mRNA levels driven by the
P2 promoter, whereas no detectable effect on P1 promoter was
observed (Fig. 1B, right). This result is further confirmed by a
luciferase-based assay (Fig. 1D). Together, the results indicate that
arsenic induces the expression of Hdm2 via the P2 promoter in a
p53-independent fashion.
Hdm2 is an ubiquitin E3 ligase targeting p53 for ubiquitination,
which can result in either proteasome-mediated degradation or
nuclear export (15). The p53 abundance did not significantly
change in arsenic-treated cells (Fig. 1); we thus analyzed p53
distribution in cells. Immunostaining with an anti-p53 antibody
indicated that untreated MCF-10A cells exhibited relatively low
levels of nuclear p53 (Fig. 2A). As expected, 5FU treatment
resulted in an increase in p53 staining that is exclusively nuclear
localized (Fig. 2A). Interestingly, in arsenic-treated cells, this
nuclear localization was markedly reduced with an accompanying
increase of cytoplasmic p53 staining (Fig. 2A). An almost identical
observation was also evident in keratinocytes (Fig. 2B). Given the
fact that the increased cytoplasmic p53 localization could be
attributed to either increased nuclear export or reduced nuclear

Arsenic Induces Cytoplasmic Accumulation of p53

Figure 2. Arsenic induces p53 accumulation in the cytoplasm. A, MCF-10A cells were treated as in Fig. 1 and were stained with an anti-p53 antibody as described in
Materials and Methods. Cells were visualized by using a fluorescence microscope, and representative fields were photographed. 4¶,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole
(DAPI ) staining is used to locate the nucleus. B, keratinocytes were analyzed as in A. C, MCF-10A cells were treated with 10 Amol/L of sodium arsenite for 12 h.
LMB (50 nmol/L) was added to cultures 6 h before fixing. Cells were analyzed as in A. D, MCF-10A cells were treated with as in C and subjected to Western
analysis. 5FU-treated cells were included as a control.

import, we treated cells with leptomycin B (LMB), which inhibits
the activity of the exportin protein Crm1 (16), to differentiate
these two possibilities. Examination of p53 distribution revealed
that this nuclear export inhibitor completely abrogated the
cytoplasmic p53 accumulation in arsenic-treated cells (Fig. 2C).
Together, our data show that arsenic exposure is associated with
increased p53 nuclear export, leading to its accumulation in the
cytoplasm.
It is well documented that Hdm2 promotes p53 ubiquitination and
subsequent nuclear export. However, the phosphorylation of S15 can
also regulate p53 subcellular localization (17). The serine 15 residue
locates within the second nuclear export signal (NES), the
phosphorylation of which could result in the inactivation of this
NES and thereby p53 nuclear accumulation. Because the S15 of p53
was not detectably phosphorylated in arsenic-treated cells (Fig. 1A),
the increased p53 nuclear export could be due to the active NH2terminal NES. To test this, we examined p53 phosphorylation when
arsenic-induced p53 nuclear export was blocked by LMB. Interestingly, in the presence of LMB, arsenic-treated cells displayed strong
S15 phosphorylation, whereas LMB alone induced little p53
phosphorylation (Fig. 2D, left). These results suggest that p53 nuclear
export was a consequence of arsenic-induced Hdm2 expression and
as a consequence, the p53 protein became inaccessible to nuclear
localized protein kinases. In agreement with this notion, treatment
of cells with wortmannin, an inhibitor of ATM, but not the
phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor, suppressed LMBinduced p53 phosphorylation in arsenic-treated cells (Fig. 2D, right).

www.aacrjournals.org

It has been previously reported that arsenic treatment can cause
changes in gene expression via activating various cellular signaling
pathways (2). To elucidate the cellular pathway that mediates
arsenic-induced Hdm2 expression, we selectively inhibited mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), p38, nuclear factor nB, or
PI3K pathways by using specific inhibitors. Whereas the inhibitors
specific to the p38, nuclear factor nB, and PI3K pathways did not
have any detectable effect, the MAPK inhibitor almost completely
abrogated arsenic-induced stimulation of the Hdm2 P2 promoter
(Fig. 3A), suggesting a role for the MAPK pathway in mediating the
effects of arsenic. Indeed, arsenic treatment resulted in marked
activation of the MAPK pathway, as evidenced by ERK phosphorylation (Fig. 3B). Our result is consistent with published data
showing activation of ERK by arsenic exposure (18). To substantiate the result derived from using pharmacologic inhibitors, we
used a dominant-negative mutant of MEKK, an upstream kinase of
ERK, as a complement approach to block the activity of this
pathway. Consistent with the results obtained from the use of
chemical inhibitors, expression of dominant-negative MEKK, but
not dominant-negative AKT, diminished the effect of arsenic on
Hdm2 levels (Fig. 3C). Our data are in good agreement with the
induction of the P2 promoter of MDM2 by the Raf/MEK/MAPK
pathway (19). Together, our results indicate that the MAPK
pathway mediates arsenic-induced up-regulation of Hdm2, which
then promotes p53 nuclear export.
We next investigated the effect of arsenic on p53 for its
biological significance. The ability of arsenic to prevent p53 from

Figure 3. Arsenic induces Hdm2 expression by the ERK pathway. A, p53-null MEFs were transfected with the hdm2 P2 promoter–driven luciferase vector. Cells
were treated with 10 Amol/L of sodium arsenite 24 h after transfection, and the indicated inhibitors (Calbiochem) were added 6 h later. The cells were incubated for
another 6 h and then harvested for luciferase assay. Columns, mean luciferase activities from experiments done in triplicate; bars, SE. B, MCF-10A cells were
serum starved overnight and then treated as indicated for 3 h. Cells were analyzed by Western blotting using the indicated antibodies. C, MCF-10A cells were treated
with 10 Amol/L of sodium arsenite for 6 h and the indicated inhibitors were added to cultures for another 6 h. Cells were analyzed by Western blotting using the
indicated antibodies. D, MCF-10A cells were transfected with plasmids encoding dominant-negative mutant of MEKK (MEKKDN ) or AKT (AKTDN ). Cells were treated
with arsenic for 24 h, after transfection for 12 h, and then analyzed by Western blot.

nuclear distribution would likely interfere with its function. To
test this, we examined the effect of arsenic on the p53 response
to UV and 5FU treatment. Significantly, both UV- and 5FUinduced p53 activation were severely compromised in the
presence of arsenic, as evidenced by the p53 protein levels and
S15 phosphorylation (Fig. 4A). To examine the cellular effects of
arsenic-mediated interference of stress-induced p53 activation,
we determined UV- or 5FU-induced cell killing in the presence or
absence of arsenic. As expected, exposure of keratinocytes to 5FU
or UV irradiation was associated with the induction of apoptosis.
Although sodium arsenite at a concentration of 1 Amol/L did not
have a detectable effect on cell viability, pretreatment of cells
with arsenic for 24 h significantly suppressed both 5FU- and UVinduced apoptosis (Fig. 4B ). To further substantiate this
observation, we examined the effect of arsenic on p53 response
in mice. C57BL/6 mice at an age of 12 weeks were fed with water
with or without sodium arsenite (1.0 mg/L) for 5 days. 5FU
(30 mg/kg) was then administered i.v. Animals were sacrificed 12
hours later and tissues were harvested. Given the fact that the
small intestine is one of the most sensitive tissues in response to
DNA damage by undergoing p53-dependent apoptosis (20), we
focused on this tissue to assess the effect of arsenic. To facilitate
the visualization of cellular morphology, we stained the tissue
with phalloidin (actin) and 4¶,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (nucleus). As shown in Fig. 4C, the small intestines are highly organized

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (22). November 15, 2008

lumen structures comprised of two single layers of epithelial cells
(a and e). Mice fed with sodium arsenite–containing water did
not show any signs of damage in the small intestine (b and f ).
In contrast, 5FU treatment resulted in marked damage in the
small intestine, as evidenced by the drastic disruption of the
lumen structures and loss of integrity of the outer epithelium
layer (c and g ). Significantly, the effect of 5FU was almost
completely mitigated in mice that had been fed with arseniccontaining water. To determine whether the 5FU-induced
damage was caused by apoptosis, we performed the terminal
nucleotidyl transferase–mediated nick end labeling assay. The
results indicate massive apoptotic cell death in the small
intestines isolated from 5FU-treated mice, whereas such 5FUinduced cell death was significantly reduced in arsenic-pretreated
animals (Fig. 4D).

Discussion
Epidemiologic studies have long supported a link between
human exposure to inorganic arsenic and an increased incidence of
cancers, which have led to intensive investigations of the
underlying mechanism. Studies with various in vitro and in vivo
models have revealed many insights implicating a number of
mechanisms such as induction of oxidative stress and DNA
damage, stimulation of cell proliferation, inhibition of DNA repair,

and deregulation of DNA methylation in arsenic-induced carcinogenesis (1, 2). These mechanisms are not mutually exclusive and
may participate to different extents in arsenic-induced carcinogenesis. Of note is that these events can all activate p53, a tumor
suppressor that functions as a transcription factor. p53 is readily
activated in response to various forms of stress and increased cell
proliferation, leading to the induction of its target genes the
products of which mediate cell cycle arrest, DNA repair, or
apoptosis. Regardless what modes of action are taken by arsenic
compounds, the tumor suppressor function of p53 almost has to be
compromised before a cell can undergo transformation. We now
show that arsenic up-regulates the expression of Hdm2, resulting in
increased p53 nuclear export, and thereby, its functional inactivation. Our study thus provides an important mechanism by which
arsenic compounds predispose cells to malignant transformation.
Available evidence indicates that arsenic induces pleiotropic
cellular effects. Dependent on the dosages, arsenic can be either
progrowth or prodeath; a low level of arsenic usually leads to the
stimulation of cell proliferation, whereas high doses are often
cytotoxic. In keeping with the biphasic dose-response of arsenic
(11, 12), the activity of p53 would be activated by high doses and
suppressed by low levels of arsenic. Indeed, high concentrations of
arsenic compounds (>20 Amol/L) almost always activate the p53

response via induction of DNA damage (18). Low levels of arsenic
stimulate cell proliferation, which is incompatible with the growthinhibitory activity of p53. Thus, the function of p53 almost has to
be inactivated before arsenic can stimulate cell proliferation. Data
from the present study shows that a low level of arsenic does so via
ERK-dependent up-regulation of MDM2 expression. Although
MAPK may regulate the level of MDM2 by multiple mechanisms,
our data seems to be consistent with a mode of transcription
regulation. In agreement with our finding, it has been shown that
the MEK-ERK pathway stimulates the P2 promoter of MDM2 by
binding to the Ets/AP1 motif (19). As one of the major p53 E3
ubiquitin ligases, MDM2 targets p53 for ubiquitination leading to
either nuclear export or proteasome-mediated degradation.
Although no significant reduction of steady state p53 levels was
seen in arsenic-treated cells, the p53 protein was found mainly in
the cytoplasm, indicating increased p53 nuclear export as the
dominant consequence to arsenic-induced up-regulation of MDM2.
Reactive oxygen species, the major mediator of low levels of
arsenic-induced cellular effects (1, 2, 12), can activate p53, which,
however, is not evident until the nuclear export is abrogated. The
data implicates that arsenic-induced nuclear export of p53 is an
early event, which prevents p53 from nuclear localized protein
kinases–mediated phosphorylation/activation. In addition, the

cytoplasm distribution prevents p53 from acting as a transcription
factor, functionally disables this tumor suppressor, which not only
makes arsenic-induced cell proliferation possible but also impedes
p53 activation in response to additional stress. The functional
significance of such an effect with arsenic is highlighted by the
compromised apoptotic response to DNA damage agents both
in vitro and in vivo. Failure to eliminate damaged cells would likely
lead to the accumulation of mutations and genomic instability. Our
data supports a model in which arsenic functionally disables tumor
suppressor p53, which is in concert with other proposed
mechanisms promoting malignant transformation.
