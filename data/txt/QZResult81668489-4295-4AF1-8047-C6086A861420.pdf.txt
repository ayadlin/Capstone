ABSTRACT:
Multiple clinical trials are ongoing to evaluate the potential antitumor activity
of human TNF variants, Fas ligand (FasL), TNF-related apoptosis inducing ligand
(TRAIL) and its agonistic antibodies. These drug products act through the death
receptors (DRs) TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1), Fas/CD95, DR4 (TRAIL-R1) and/or DR5
(TRAIL-R2), respectively. Therefore, characterization of the level and localization of
DR expression in cancer cells is important for DR-targeted therapy. In this study, we
examined the subcellular distribution of the four DRs in a panel of 10 human breast
cancer cell lines by western blots and flow cytometry and 50 human breast tumors by
immunohistochemistry. Despite their total protein expressions, the DRs were found
to be absent on the surface of some cell lines. Consistent with this result, all four DRs
were found to be mostly expressed in the cytoplasm and/or the nucleus of primary
breast tumors (n=50). We further determined the growth inhibition activity (GI50) of
the death ligands, recombinant human TNFα, FasL and TRAIL, and found a correlation
with the subcellular localization of the corresponding DRs. These results demonstrate
an aberrant expression of the death receptors in breast cancer cells, and suggest that
the lack of surface DRs appears to be predictive of tumor resistance to DR-targeted
therapies.

INTRODUCTION

Fas/CD95 is also explored as a cancer therapeutic
target (www.clinicaltrails.gov). A major move in the
development of DR-targeted cancer therapy is the finding
that TRAIL selectively induces apoptosis in cancer cells
over most normal cells through activation of DR4 and/
or DR5 expressed on target cells (9, 10). This unique
property of TRAIL has generated considerable interest in
clinically testing recombinant human TRAIL (rhTRAIL)
and agnostic monoclonal antibodies against DR4 or DR5
(9, 11-13). However, tumor cells were often found to be
sparsely sensitive to DR-mediated apoptosis or acquire
resistance during therapy (14, 15). A better understanding
of the resistance mechanisms could help identify
molecular markers for predicting tumor response to DRtargeted therapies, thereby guiding the selection of patients
for better treatment outcomes.
The classic mode of signal transduction for DRs
involves activation of cell-surface DRs via binding of

The death receptors (DRs) TNFR1, Fas/CD95, DR4
and DR5 are attractive targets for cancer therapy due to
their ability to induce apoptosis in various types of cancer
cells, including breast cancer (1-4). These receptors are
characterized by a death domain in the cytoplasmic tail
which transduces signals from their cognate ligands such
as TNFα, Fas ligand (FasL) and TNF-related apoptosis
inducing ligand (TRAIL). Despite disappointing results
from early clinical trials for recombinant TNFα, which
showed severe toxicity after systemic exposure (5,
6), there is a continued effort to separate the unwanted
toxicities from its potent apoptosis inducing activity by
modifying TNF protein; for example, NGR-TNFα fusion
protein (7) and TNFα-colloidal gold nanoparticles (8)
are currently in clinical trails for treating human cancers.

a cognate ligand, followed by the formation of a deathinducing signaling complex (DISC) at proximity of the
inner layer of plasma membrane (1, 2). The key elements
of a DISC include an adaptor protein TNFR-associated
death-domain (TRADD) or Fas-associated deathdomain (FADD), and pro-caspases 8 or 10. Within the
DISC, caspase 8 or 10 becomes activated through autoproteolysis that triggers activation of effector caspases
(e.g. caspase 3), cleavage of many cellular substrates,
and ultimately apoptotic cell death. Activation of TNFR1
or Fas can also recruit other components (e.g. RIP1 and
TRAF2) into the DISC for activation of NFκ-B pathway
(16). Increasing evidence indicates that the activation
of DRs also triggers accelerated endocytosis of ligandreceptor complexes. For example, binding of TNFR1 or
Fas induces the rapid clustering of the respective receptor,
followed by internalization of the ligand-receptor complex
via clathrin-coated pits formation (17-19). The internalized
TNFR1 or Fas was shown to facilitate the assembly of
secondary DISC complexes at intracellular endosomal
compartments thereby amplifying the pro-apoptotic signal.
Recent reports show that TRAIL receptors are also subject
to regulation of endocytosis signals (20, 21). Our studies
have shown that both DR4 and DR5 undergo constitutive
or ligand-induced internalization in some breast cancer
cell lines (14, 15, 22). Although the roles of DR4/DR5
endocytosis are just beginning to be understood, it may
serve as a mechanism to terminate apoptosis signaling
through TRAIL receptors (22).
We believe that understanding the relationship
between differential expression and cellular localization of
DRs will be beneficial in the development of biomarkers
for predicting tumor response to the DR-targeted cancer
therapies. In this study, we examined the cellular
localization of the four DRs in breast cancer cell lines and
primary breast tumors. We further compared DR cellular
localization with cellular sensitivity to apoptosis induced
by individual death ligands.

was also widely expressed, whereas Fas was only detected
in four cell lines including SUM1315 M02 and T47D.
Next, we investigated the DR expression on cell
surface by flow cytometry using phycoerythrin (PE)conjugated antibodies specific to each receptor. The
presence of surface DR is indicated by a right-shift of
the histogram peak relative to a control IgG-PE (Fig.
1C& 1D). The results showed distinct surface expression
patterns for individual DRs. Specifically, we noted a
differential surface positivity for DR4 (1/10), DR5 (3/10),
TNFR1 (8/10), and Fas (4/10) among the ten cell lines.
DR4 was only expressed on the surface of MDA-MB-231
cells while DR5 surface expression was detected for
MDA-MB-231, SUM1315 M02 and ZR751 cells. Most
cell lines expressed at least one DR on surface, except
BT474 cells. MDA-MB-231 was the only cell line that
expressed all four DRs on surface. Notably, the surface
expression of a DR did not necessarily correlate with its
total protein level in a specific cell line. In AU565 cells,
for example, both DR4 and DR5 were deficient on cell
surface while their total protein expressions were among
the highest compared to other cell lines. We attempted
to estimate the ratio between a surface DR and its total
protein amount in a specific cell line. DR5 and TNFR1
were chosen for this analysis because their total protein
expressions were detected in all the cell lines (Fig. 1A).
The total protein levels were estimated by densitometry
analysis of the blots in Fig. 1A, and the surface
expressions were estimated by the right-shift values (mean
fluorescence intensity) in Fig. 1C. Despite its total protein
expression, little or no DR5 was present on surface of
AU565, BT474, HCC1428, MDA-MB-453, and MDAMB-361 cells (Fig. 1E). A different pattern was found for
TNFR1, showing a higher frequency of surface expression
(8 out of 10 cell lines).
To further characterize the cellular localization of
DRs, we transfected MDA-MB-231 and AU565 cells
with a plasmid encoding GFP-DR4. As shown in Fig. 2,
GFP-DR4 was clearly expressed on the surface of MDAMB-231 cells although it was also detected in intracellular
compartments. By contrast, GFP-DR4 was predominantly
localized in the intracellular compartments with little or
no surface expression in AU565 cells. These data are
in agreement with the expression pattern observed for
endogenous DR4 (Fig. 1C), demonstrating that certain
breast cancer cell lines are defective in expressing DR(s)
on cell surface.

be differentially expressed among the cell lines examined

higher level in AU565 and MDA-MB-231 cells. TNFR1

ligands. To this end, we measured cell viability as a
function of concentrations of rhTNF, rhTRAIL and
rhFasL, respectively (Fig. 3A-C). The dose-response
curves were fitted to derive GI50 values for individual
cell lines (Table 1). The results show that most of these
cell lines were resistant to the death ligands (GI50 > 500
ng/mL). Notably, the observed cellular resistance closely
correlated with the absence of the corresponding DR on
surface of target cells. On the other hand, the surface
expression of a particular DR did not always correlate
with cellular sensitivity to its cognate ligand. This was
especially true for rhTNFα/TNFR1, where eight cell lines
expressing surface TNFR1 were found to be resistant
to rhTNFα-induced cell death. Among the ten cell lines
tested, only MDA-MB-361 cells were sensitive to rhTNFα.
This was confirmed by a direct measurement of apoptosis
index and cleavage of caspase-8 and caspase-3 in the
treated cells (Fig. 3D). Similarly, MDA-MB-231 cells
were resistant to rhTNFα while remained highly sensitive
to rhTRAIL. Overall, these results support the conclusion
that lack of surface expression of a DR is sufficient for
rendering cellular resistance to the cytotoxicity from its
corresponding death ligand. Consistent with the notion
that TRAIL could induce apoptosis through DR4 and/or
DR5, TRAIL resistance occurred when both receptors
were deficient on cell surface of target cells.

by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Strikingly, specific
staining of individual DR was noted in cytoplasm and/
or nucleus of the cells (Fig. 4A). We also quantified the
expression levels by combining the intensity and the
distribution scores (see details in Materials & Methods).
The scores for individual tumor samples are provided in
Supplement I, and presented in Fig. 4B. All four DRs
showed cytoplasmic and/or nuclear staining pattern
through disease progression (Grade 1 to Grade 3). The
immunostaining of DR4 and DR5 was noted to be stronger
than those of TNFR1 and Fas. However, the expression
levels of each DR did not differ significantly between
tumor stages except a slight increase in DR4 from Grade 1
to Grade 2 (p>0.05) (Fig. 4B). Although the IHC staining
did not exclude the possibility of surface expression, the
staining patterns were generally consistent with the cell
line data that indicate the mislocalization of DRs in breast
cancer cells.

DISCUSSION
The death receptor (DR)-targeted protein products
have shown promise in early clinical trials for treating
human cancers (7, 13, 23, 24). However, concerns about
drug resistance in tumor cells are shifting the emphasis
toward the identification of predictive biomarkers as
well as effective combination therapies. In this study, we
demonstrated the cell surface and intracellular localization
of TNFR1, Fas, DR4 and DR5 in human breast cancer
cells. Despite their total protein expression, these DRs
were not expressed on cell surface of some cell lines.
The surface deficiency of a particular DR correlated
with cellular resistance to its corresponding death ligand.

Strikingly, the expressions of the DRs in primary breast
tumors were mostly localized to the cytoplasm and/or
nucleus. Our results suggested that different localizations
of DR expression (plasma membrane versus intracellular
compartments) might be useful in identifying suitable
patients for DR-targeted treatment.
Previous studies have demonstrated the expression
of TNFR1, Fas, DR4, and DR5 at mRNA and total protein

levels in a variety of cancer types. However, the results
showed no direct link with the cellular sensitivity to the
targeted therapies. Here, we examined the DR expressions
in both whole cells and plasma membrane. In a ten cell
line panel, the four DRs showed distinct patterns in their
surface expression with positivity for DR4 (1/10), DR5
(3/10), TNFR1 (8/10), and Fas (4/10) (Fig. 1). In AU565
cells, for example, DR5 expression was among the

indicated by a decline in the pro-caspase forms, a simultaneous accumulation of cleaved fragments (p43/41 and p20), and the cleavage of
a caspase substrate poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP).

highest in the panel but the receptor was not found on cell
surface. The results were also consistent with our previous
observation that DR4 was deficient at a higher frequency
than DR5 in human cancer cells (15, 25). Importantly, the
lack of surface expression of a specific DR correlated with
the observed resistance to its corresponding death ligand
(Table 1). On the other hand, the cell lines expressing
surface DRs were not necessarily responsive to the ligands.
This was especially true for TNFR1, which displayed a
high percent of surface expression (8 out 10 cell lines)
but a low responsive rate (2/8) to rhTNFα cytotoxicity
(Fig. 3). We suspect that these cell lines may contain
deficiency(ies) in the signaling components downstream
of a specific DR, which may include downregulation
of caspase-8 or upregulation of Bcl2, IAPs and other
antiapoptotic proteins as found in many other cell types
(25, 26). Nonetheless, the deficiency of cell surface DRs
is sufficient for rendering cellular resistance to the DRdependent therapies. Consistent with the cell line data
(Fig. 1), the DRs were found to be mostly expressed
in cytoplasm and/or nucleus in primary breast tumors
(n=50). The diversity of resistance mechanisms suggests
that tumors could be classified into four distinct groups: a)
intact and functional DR pathways; b) DR deficiency on
surface despite its total protein expression; c) deficiency
in one or multiple intracellular signaling components (e.g.
caspases, Bcl2, IAPs); and d) deficiency in both surface
DR and its downstream signaling components. The
combinational therapies should be designed to overcome
or bypass the specific resistance mechanism(s) in a given
tumor. In the cases of DR surface deficiency, one strategy
would be to restore the surface expression of the DR on
tumor cells. Further studies are underway to search for
such drug candidates that could potentially enhance the
clinical efficacy of the DR-dependent cancer therapies.
The mislocalization of DR4 and DR5 has been
observed in other cell types, including CD4+ T cells (27)
and cells of cervical neoplasia (28), melanoma (29), and
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (30, 31). In these

cases, both DR4 and DR5 were reported to be mainly
expressed in cytoplasm and/or nucleus. However, little
is known about the underlying molecular mechanisms.
A recent study identified two nuclear localization signals
in DR5 protein which mediates its nuclear localization
through the nuclear import pathway by importin beta1 in
Hela and HepG2 cells (32). The overexpression of DRs
in cytoplasm may reflect receptor-ligand internalization,
a rapid process occurring after ligand binding. Numerous
studies have shown that TNFR1 and Fas undergo rapid
internalization in response to ligation (17-19). TRAIL
receptors, DR4 and DR5, were also shown to follow a
similar mode of action (14, 15, 20-22). In a tumor setting,
this might be triggered by soluble cytokines (TNFα,
FasL or TRAIL) in the tumor microenvironment (33).
The signaling events may involve clathrin-dependent
endocytosis or other uncharacterized mechanisms (15,
20, 21). However, we can not exclude the possibility that
intracellular localization of DRs may be newly synthesized
molecules within the endoplasmic reticulum or Golgi
that have yet to be processed and inserted properly into
the plasma membranes. In any event, the trapped DR in
cytoplasm inevitably reduces its accessibility to incoming
ligands, thereby making the cells resistant to the targeted
therapies.
Numerous efforts have been made to identify
chemotherapeutic agents that can be used in combination
with the DR-targeted agents to overcome or bypass
the resistance mechanisms (6, 34, 35). For instance,
flavopiridol (34) and actinomycin D (6) have been
shown to potentiate the cytotoxicity of rhTNFα in cells
of lymphoma and prostate carcinoma. Consistent with
these results, both agents are found to enhance rhTNFα
induced apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 and BT474 breast
cancer cell lines (Supplement I). However, there was
no apparent effect on surface expression of TNFR1
in the treated cells. As previously proposed (34), the
synergy effect may be a result of inhibition of TNFαinduced expression of inhibitors of caspases. These data

are in line with other reports showing the diversity of
resistance mechanisms which highlights the necessity for
the identification of combinational therapies to target the
specific mechanism(s) of drug resistance in individual
cancer patients.
Of clinical relevance, the mislocalization of DRs
was also observed in primary breast tumor cells. Further
studies should aim at investigating whether different
patterns of immunostaining (cell surface versus cytoplasm
or nucleus) might help to select patients for different
approaches for DR-targeted treatment. In addition to
breast cancer, the DR-targeted protein products are being
clinically evaluated for treating many other malignancy
types. Therefore, it will be also of importance to determine
the cellular localization of DRs in other tumors.

death ligand at the indicated concentrations. At the
selected time points, cells were collected and analyzed
by flow cytometry after staining with annexin V-FITC
(Pharmingen) and propidium iodide (PI) (36). Apoptotic
cells were characterized by positive staining of annexin
V-FITC and/or PI. All experiments were performed
in triplicate and at least 3 repetitive experiments were
performed for each result.

Flow cytometric analysis for cell surface expression of
death receptors.
FACS analysis of cell surface expression of TNFR1,
Fas, DR4 and DR5 was performed using the phycoerythrin
(PE) -conjugated antibodies as described previously (22).
The phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated forms of anti-TNFR1
(IgG1, FAB225P), anti-Fas (IgG1, FAB142F), anti-DR4
(IgG1, FAB347P), and anti-DR5 (IgG2b, FAB6311P)
antibodies as well as IgG1 and IgG2b controls were
purchased from R & D Systems (Minneapolis, MN).
In brief, cells at 70-80% confluence were harvested by
incubation with an enzyme-free cell-dissociation Buffer
(Invitrogen) and washed twice in culture medium. Cells
(~5 x 105) were incubated in blocking solution (phosphate
buffered saline containing 5 % goat serum and 1% bovine
serum albumin) for 20 min on ice. Afterwards, cells (30
µL) were incubated with 10 µg/mL of PE-conjugated
antibodies to the death receptors for 45 min at 4 °C in
the dark. Duplicate samples were incubated with the
respective IgG1-PE or IgG2b-PE as negative controls.
Cells were then washed twice with PBS and resuspended
in 0.5 mL PBS for flow cytometry analysis using a FACS
Calibur (BD Biosciences).

Immunohistochemistry.
The expression of death receptor proteins in primary
breast tumors was assessed using the commercial breast
cancer tissue microarrays (TMAs) from US Biomax
(Rockville, MD). Informed consent has been obtained
and kept on file at the tissue banks. The donor’s identity
is anonymity and all tissues and data are labeled using
only ID Codes. All the tissue samples were preserved in
10% phosphate buffered formalin (pH 7.4), embedded
in paraffin, processed into sections. Array sections (4
µm thick) were mounted on the positive charged super
plus glass slide. Each individual core was 1.5 mm in
diameter and spaced 0.25 mm. Pathology diagnosis
of tissues in TMAs was provided by the vendor, and
confirmed at our laboratory by the microscopic evaluation
of the histopathology of the cores by a board certified
pathologist.
For immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis, tissue
sections were deparaffinized in xylene, and rehydrated in
gradients of alcohol and water. Endogenous peroxidase
activity was blocked by incubating slides in 3% hydrogen
peroxide at room temperature for 5 minutes. Antigen
retrieval was performed in the Target Retrieval solution
(Dako Cytomation) for 30 minutes in microwave oven.
To reduce non-specific staining, slides were washed in
phosphate buffered saline with Tween-20, followed by
incubation in 2.5% normal horse blocking serum for 30

Immunofluorescence microscopy.
Cells were cultured on glass chamber slides at
70-80% confluency and transiently transfected with a
plasmid for expression of GFP-DR4 (15). After 24 h posttransfection, cells were stained with CellTracker Red
(Invitrogen) and fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde for 30
min in PBS, pH 7.4. Finally, the slides were detached
from the medium chamber and mounted with Antifade
reagent (Invitrogen). Confocal microscopy acquisitions
were performed on a Zeiss LAM 5 PASCAL confocal
laser scanning microscope. All images are representative
of 3-5 independent experiments.
Cytotoxicity assays.
Cell viability was assessed using a MTS assay
(Promega One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay
(G3580). Briefly, cells were seeded in 96-well plates at
plating densities ranging from 5000 to 10000 cells/well
depending on the doubling time of individual cell lines.
After 24 h incubation, some of the wells were processed
to determine a time zero density. To the rest of the plates,
individual death ligand (rhTNF, rhFasL or rhTRAIL) was
added at seven different doses (0.1, 0.5, 1, 5, 10, 100,

Systems), anti-DR5 (#ALX-210-743-C200, Enzo Life
Sciences) anti-Fas/CD95 (#VP-F702, Vector Lab) and
anti-TNFR1 (#MAB225, R&D Systems). After washing
three times, slides were incubated for 30 minutes with
ImmPRESS reagent (Vector Laboratories) followed by
incubation with the peroxidase substrate DAB solution
(DAKO Cytomation) until desired stain intensity develops.
Slides were counterstained with Hematoxylin and mounted
with permanent mounting medium. Evaluation of the IHC
was performed by a board certified pathologist.  
The IHC score was determined by combining
the intensity and distribution scores (percentage of the
positivity in the tumor tissues) scores (37). The staining
intensity was based on a 4-point system: 0 (no staining),
1 (weak), 2 (moderate), and 3 (strong). The distribution
score was assessed as follows: 0 = less than 10% of the
cancer cells stained on the sections; 1 = 10% to 40%; 2 =
40% to 70%; and 3 = more than 70%. The final score was
reported by the sum of the intensity and the distribution
scores, yielding a score range between 0 and 6.
