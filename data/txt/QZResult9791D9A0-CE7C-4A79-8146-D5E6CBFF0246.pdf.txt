BACKGROUND: There is increasing evidence that paclitaxel and carboplatin are clinically active in the treatment of
metastatic melanoma (MM). ABI-007 is an albumin-bound formulation of paclitaxel that has demonstrated single-agent
activity against metastatic melanoma. METHODS: A parallel phase II trial was conducted in patients with unresectable
stage IV melanoma who were either chemotherapy naive (CN) or previously treated (PT). The treatment regimen
consisted of ABI-007 (100 mg/m2) and carboplatin area under the curve (AUC2) administered on days 1, 8, and 15
every 28 days. The primary aim of this study was objective response rate (RECIST). RESULTS: Seventy-six patients
(41 CN and 35 PT) were enrolled between November 2006 and July 2007. Three patients withdrew consent prior to
starting treatment. The median number of treatment cycles was 4. There were 10 (25.6%) responses (1 complete
response [CR] and 9 partial responses [PRs]) in the CN cohort (90% CI, 16.7%-42.3%) and 3 (8.8%) responses (3 PRs)
in the PT cohort (90% CI, 2.5%-21.3%). Median progression-free survival was 4.5 months in the CN cohort and 4.1
months in the PT cohort. Median overall survival (OS) was 11.1 months in the CN group and 10.9 months in the PT
group. Severe toxicities in both groups (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Effects v.3.0 grade 3) included
neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, neurosensory problems, fatigue, nausea, and vomiting. CONCLUSIONS: The weekly
combination of ABI-007 and carboplatin appears to be moderately well tolerated, with promising clinical activity as
therapy in patients who are chemotherapy naive and with modest antitumor activity in those previously treated.

KEYWORDS: metastatic melanoma, nab-paclitaxel, carboplatin, chemotherapy, stage IV, unresectable.

Patients diagnosed with metastatic (stage IV) melanoma face a poor prognosis, with a median overall survival (OS)

time of 6-9 months and 5-year survival of approximately 5%.1 Currently, dacarbazine remains the only Food and Drug
Administration (FDA)-approved chemotherapy agent for stage IV melanoma, with response rates of less than 20% and no
improvement in OS.2 Several combination regimens have produced response rates of 30%-50% but with higher toxicity
rates and no impact on OS.3-6 Thus, the need for more effective therapy for metastatic melanoma remains.

ABI-007/Carboplatin in Stage IV Melanoma/Kottschade et al

The combination of carboplatin and paclitaxel has
been shown to be active in a wide range of malignancies
including metastatic melanoma.7-12 Response rates in a
phase II trial setting and a retrospective review showed an
objective response rate (ORR) of this combination of
approximately 20%-25%,7,8 with a third small randomized phase II trial showing no objective responses but stabilization of disease of approximately 20% in the
combination paclitaxel þ carboplatin arm.9 In addition a
recently reported randomized phase II trial utilizing paclitaxel and carboplatin  bevacizumab/placebo showed a
response rate for the control arm of approximately
16.4%.10 Two phase III trials examining the impact of
adding sorafenib to paclitaxel and carboplatin (in both
chemotherapy-naive11 and previously treated12 settings)
reported an ORR of 16% and 11%, respectively, in each
of the paclitaxel/carboplatin arms, with progression-free
survival (PFS) of 4.1 months11 and 17.9 weeks, respectively.12 Treatments were generally well tolerated, with
cytopenias, neuropathy, nausea, vomiting and hypersensitivity reactions as the primary toxicities.
Given the modest clinical efficacy of the combination of paclitaxel and carboplatin for therapy of stage IV
melanoma7-12 and the development of ABI-007 (Abraxane, nab-paclitaxel), a solvent-free, albumin-bound formulation of paclitaxel designed to reduce the Cremophor
vehicle-associated toxicity of paclitaxel suggested examining the antitumor effect of the combination of ABI-007
and carboplatin.
There are at least 2 potential advantages of the use
of ABI-007 in place of paclitaxel in combination with
carboplatin for patients with metastatic melanoma. First,
ABI-007 has the ability to deliver a higher dose of paclitaxel. This was clearly demonstrated in the metastatic
breast cancer setting in a randomized phase III study comparing ABI-007 at 260 mg/m2 to paclitaxel at 175 mg/m2
on a schedule of every 3 weeks.13 The ABI-007 arm
demonstrated significantly higher response rates and time
to progression, as well as a significantly lower incidence of
grade 3 or 4 neutropenia, despite the increased dose of
paclitaxel administered in the ABI-007 arm.13 There was
an increased incidence of grade 3 peripheral neuropathy
in the ABI-007 arm, but with a more rapid recovery. In
addition, ABI-007 obviates ‘‘allergic’’ premedications and
shortens infusion time relative to paclitaxel. Of particular
interest for melanoma is the ability of ABI-007 (and not
paclitaxel) to bind SPARC (secreted protein acidic and
rich in cysteine), a protein highly expressed on malignant
melanocytes.14 This is a potentially important pathway in

Cancer

delivering ABI-007 to the tumor at high concentrations.14,15 This may have explained the results of singleagent ABI-007 therapy in patients with previously treated
stage IV melanoma, demonstrating clinical activity superior to prior studies of paclitaxel,16 and as such, the substitution of ABI-007 for paclitaxel in combination with
carboplatin for the treatment of metastatic melanoma
may offer greater clinical benefit.
A phase I trial of 3 different schedules of ABI-007
administered in combination with carboplatin in patients
with solid tumors found a maximum tolerated dose for
ABI-007 (MTD) of 300 mg/m2 every 3 weeks, 100 mg/m2
on days 1, 8, and 15 every 28 days, and 125 mg/m2 on
days 1 and 8 every 21 days, all with carboplatin AUC 6
on day 1.17,18 This trial enrolled 10 (of 41) patients with
metastatic melanoma, of whom 3 patients had a PR on
the weekly regimen and 3 patients had stable disease (SD)
on the every-3-weeks regimen.17,18 There was a higher
degree of severe (grade 3) neutropenia and thrombocytopenia with the weekly regimen.
Here we present the results of a phase II clinical trial
utilizing a combination of carboplatin (AUC 2) and
ABI-007 (100 mg/m2) administered as a weekly regimen
(on days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28-day treatment cycle) to both
chemotherapy-naive and previously treated (no prior
exposure to taxanes) patients with stage IV melanoma.
We selected the weekly dosing regimen of carboplatin in
the hope of decreasing the incidence of grade 3 cytopenias, as was seen in the phase I trial.

PATIENTS AND METHODS
This study consisted of 2 parallel phase II clinical trials
(cohorts) to assess the antitumor activity and safety profile
of the combination of carboplatin and ABI-007 in
patients with unresectable stage IV malignant melanoma
who either were previously treated with chemotherapy in
the metastatic setting (cohort 1) or were chemotherapy
naive in the metastatic setting (cohort 2). This study was a
multi-institution cooperative group study conducted
through the North Central Cancer Treatment Group.
All patients provided signed informed written consent.
This study was approved by the institutional review
boards of all participating institutions.
Eligible patients had to be 18 years of age with
unresectable, histologically confirmed stage IV melanoma. Additional eligibility criteria included measurable
disease as defined by the Response Evaluation Criteria in
Solid Tumors (RECIST), Eastern Cooperative Oncology
Group performance status (PS) of 0-2, life expectancy 3

months, adequate hematologic and hepatic function, and
4 weeks since the last chemotherapy (cohort 1 only),
radiation therapy, or immunotherapy. Exclusion criteria
included any prior treatment with platinum or taxanes
(cohorts 1 and 2), any prior chemotherapy for metastatic
disease (cohort 2), active infection, New York Heart
Association Class III or IV, peripheral neuropathy grade
2, other malignancy <5 years (except for nonmelanomatous skin cancer or carcinoma in situ of the cervix), or
untreated metastatic melanoma to the brain or progression of brain metastasis within 3 months of study entry.
Women who were pregnant or breastfeeding were not
enrolled.
Study Design and Treatment
Eligible patients (both cohorts) were treated with
100 mg/m2 of ABI-007 by intravenous infusion over
30 minutes, followed by carboplatin with a target AUC of
2 (by Calvert formula with Cockroft and Gault Equation
and actual body weight) over 30 minutes on days 1, 8,
and 15 of a 28-day cycle, for a maximum of 8 cycles. If
patients did not develop excessive toxicity or progressive
disease, treatment beyond 8 cycles was at the discretion of
the treating physician.
Within 14 days of registration, patients underwent a
complete physical exam, assessment of performance status, complete blood cell count, comprehensive metabolic
panel including lactic dehydrogenase, and a tumor assessment by conventional CT or MRI or spiral CT. Prior to
each cycle of treatment, patients underwent a physical
exam, toxicity assessments, and blood draws for hematologic and chemistry groups. Tumor status was assessed
every 8 weeks until progression using RECIST criteria.
On day 1 of each treatment cycle, treatment was held
if absolute neutrophil count (ANC) was <1500/mm3 or
platelet count (PLT) was <100,000/mm3 or the patient
developed a grade 2 aspartate aminotransferase, grade
2 neuropathy, or other grade 3 nonhematologic toxicity. When patients had recovered from these toxicities,
treatment was restarted with a 20% dose reduction in both
agents. On day 8 or 15 of each treatment cycle, treatment
was omitted if ANC was <1000/mm3 or PLT was
<100,000/mm3 or the patient developed either a grade
2 neuropathy or grade 3 nonhematologic toxicity.
Study treatment was terminated if toxicities did not recover
to acceptable levels within 4 weeks and/or if patients
required a third dose reduction due to toxicity.
All patients received standard supportive care,
including antiemetics, antibiotics, blood/platelet trans-

1706

fusions, erythropoietin, and colony-stimulating factors at
the discretion of the treating physician.
Statistical Considerations
The primary endpoint for both trials was the clinical
response rate, defined as the number of eligible patients
whose disease met RECIST criteria 1.0 for response, that
is, a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) on 2
consecutive evaluations at least 8 weeks apart divided by
the number of eligible patients who began treatment. For
those patients whose disease responded to treatment, the
duration of response was defined as the time from the first
tumor evaluation, when an objective status of CR or PR
was assigned, to date of disease progression.
For cohort 1 (prior chemotherapy, PT), a sample of
35 patients was to be enrolled so that a 1-sided alpha ¼
0.10 1-sample test of proportions would have at least a
90% chance of detecting whether the ORR was greater
than 5% when it was at least 20%. If at least 4 patients of
the 35 eligible patients enrolled had a tumor response
without excessive toxicity, the regimen would be considered for further testing in this patient population.
For cohort 2 (chemotherapy naive, CN), a sample of
35 patients was to be enrolled so that a 1-sided alpha ¼
0.10 1-sample test of proportions would have at least a
90% chance of detecting whether the ORR was greater
than 15% when it was at least 35%. If at least 9 patients of
the 35 eligible patients enrolled had a tumor response
without excessive toxicity, the regimen would be considered for further testing in this patient population.
A 90% confidence interval for the response rate was
constructed using the properties of the binomial distribution. Progression-free survival time was defined as the time
elapsed from registration to progression of disease or death
without prior documentation of progressive disease. Survival time was defined as the time elapsed from registration
to death due to any cause. Time-to-event distributions was
estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method.19 Toxicities
were graded and attribution assigned by treating physicians
using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 3.0.

administered was 4 cycles (total, 135 cycles; range, 1-10
cycles). Fifteen patients (44.1%) received 85% or more of
the total ABI-007 dose they should have received for their
time on treatment. Twenty-one patients (61.8%) omitted
day 8 and/or 15 of treatment (8 patients), had at least 1
dose reduction (3 patients), or both (10 patients), primarily because of severe neutropenia, fatigue, and neuropathy. The most common severe (grade 3) toxicities
(possibly, probably, or definitely related to treatment)
reported included neutropenia (41%), leukopenia (15%),
lymphopenia (3%), vomiting (3%), nausea (3%), and
peripheral nerve infection: herpes zoster (3%). Grade 2
neuromotor and neurosensory difficulties were reported
in 3% and 9% of patients, respectively (Table 2). The reasons for treatment discontinuation included progression
of disease (27 patients), excessive toxicity (need for a third
dose reduction [3 patients], persistent fatigue [1 patient],
and severe allergic reaction [1 patient]), and refusal to
continue treatment (2 patients).
Cohort 2 (CN)

At the time of this report, all but 1 of 39 patients
have discontinued study treatment. The median number

received for their time on treatment. Twenty-five patients
(64.1%) omitted day 8 and/or 15 of treatment
(12 patients), had at least 1 dose reduction (4 patients), or
both (9 patients), primarily because of severe neutropenia
and neuropathy. The primary reason for study discontinuation was progression of disease (28 patients). There was 1
treatment-related death in this cohort. This was a 79-yearold man with M1b stage disease who died 26 days after
enrolling, having completed 1 cycle of treatment. He developed grade 4 febrile neutropenia, diarrhea, infectious colitis, and hypotension. The most common severe (grade 3)
toxicities (possibly, probably, or definitely related to
treatment) reported included neutropenia (28%), thrombocytopenia (5%), neurosensory difficulties (5%), vomiting (3%), nausea (3%), fatigue (3%), and leukopenia
(3%). Grade 2 neurosensory difficulties were reported in
3% of patients. (Table 2) The reasons for treatment discontinuation included progression of disease (28 patients),
excessive toxicity (need for a third dose reduction
[1 patient], neuropathies [2 patients], and severe allergic
reaction [1 patient], severe nausea and vomiting
[1 patient]), death (1 patient), and refusal to continue treatment (1 patient), desire for alternative treatment (1 patient),
and completion of 8 cycles of treatment (3 patients).

Clinical Efficacy
Cohort 1 (PT)

All but 1 patient (who refused further follow-up)
were followed for a minimum of 9.0 months or until
death. Three patients had a partial tumor response lasting
3.2, 3.5, and 11.6 months, respectively. No CRs were
reported. Thus, the tumor response rate was 8.8% (90%

CI, 2.5-21.3%). At last contact, 1 patient was alive
without disease progression, 6 patients were alive with disease progression, and 27 patients had died of their disease.
The median PFS was 4.2 months, and the median OS was
10.9 months (Fig. 1).
Cohort 2 (CN)

All patients were followed for a minimum of 1.7
years or until death. Among the first 35 patients enrolled,
there were 9 patients (25.7%; 90% CI, 14.1%-40.6%)
who had a tumor response (1 CR and 8 PRs). Among all
39 patients enrolled, there were 10 patients (25.6%; 90%
CI, 14.6%-39.6%) who had a tumor response (1 CR
and 9 PRs) lasting 4.0 to 30.6þ months (median,
12.1 months). Thus, the tumor response rate was 25.6%
(90% CI, 14.6%-39.6%). At last contact, 3 patients were
alive without disease progression, 4 patients were alive
with disease progression, and 32 patients had died of their
disease. The median PFS was 4.3 months, and the median
OS was 11.1 months (Fig. 2).

DISCUSSION
The results of the presented study in patients with metastatic melanoma demonstrate that the combination of
ABI-007 and carboplatin has promising clinical activity
for patients who are chemotherapy naive but fail to
meet/exceed the study threshold for promising clinical
activity in patients who have been previously treated in
the metastatic setting. Overall, treatment was moderately
well tolerated, with the main toxicities being nausea,
Cancer

vomiting, peripheral neuropathy, and cytopenias (neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia).
Previous studies have shown that a taxane-based regimen in combination with carboplatin has some activity
in melanoma.7-12 Hodi et al7 reported the results of a
small phase II pilot study utilizing an every-3-week regimen of paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 and carboplatin AUC 7.5
on day 1. Of the 15 patients enrolled, 3 had PRs, and 7
had stable disease, with a median survival of 9 months.
Zimpfer-Rechner et al conducted a randomized phase II
study utilizing single-agent paclitaxel (100 mg/m2 per
day) versus the paclitaxel (80 mg/m2 per day) and carboplatin (200 mg/m2 per day). The dosing on this regimen
was quite different with paclitaxel  carboplatin being
utilized weekly for 6 weeks on and 2 weeks off. Forty
patients were enrolled, with 32 being evaluable. There
were no responses reported in the combination arm, but
the SD rate was 20%.9 Rao et al,8 in a single-institution
retrospective review of 31 patients treated with the combination as second-line therapy primarily administered as a
weekly regimen (paclitaxel 100 mg/m2 and carboplatin
AUC 2 on days 1, 8, and 15 every 28 days), reported a
26% PR rate and a 19% SD rate.8 Finally, 2 randomized
phase III trials examining the impact of adding sorafenib
to paclitaxel and carboplatin found ORRs of 11%12 and
16%11 in the paclitaxel/carboplatin arms. Replacing paclitaxel with ABI-007 in the hope of improving the toxicity
profile and thus increasing the amount of drug given
resulted in promising antitumor activity (ORR, 25.6%)
among CN patients but not among PT patients. The toxicity profile of this study showed less toxicity than that of
the 2 PRISM studies,11,12 with less overall grade 3 or 4
cytopenias, fatigue, and sensory neuropathy. The etiology
of this is not completely clear but most likely is a result of
replacing paclitaxel with ABI-007 and a lower weekly
carboplatin dosing. However, allergic reactions were significantly reduced with the use of ABI-007. The present
study also showed slightly better survival rates compared
with that of ipilumimab (PFS, 2.9 months; OS,
10.1 months).20 In summary, the presented data confirm
that ABI-007 approximates the efficacy and toxicity of
paclitaxel when combined with carboplatin for the treatment of patients with metastatic melanoma. Although
such regimens have not been formally compared in a
randomized controlled study, the combination of ABI007 and carboplatin is a viable option when CN patients
cannot tolerate conventional paclitaxel therapy. In addition, recent evidence of the combination of bevacizumab
with paclitaxel and carboplatin, although not definitive,

Cancer

April 15, 2011

seems to suggest a better clinical outcome compared with
prior FDA-approved therapies.10,21 Whether the addition
of bevacizumab to the combination of ABI-007 and
carboplatin will yield similar (or superior) results to those
of paclitaxel/carboplatin is the subject of an ongoing study.
