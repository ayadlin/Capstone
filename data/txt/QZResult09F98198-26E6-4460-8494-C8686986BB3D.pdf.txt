Abstract
Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a highly heterogeneous and recurrent subtype of breast cancer that
lacks an effective targeted therapy. To identify candidate therapeutic targets, we proﬁled global gene expression in
TNBC and breast tumor-initiating cells with a patient survival dataset. Eight TNBC-related kinases were found to
be overexpressed in TNBC cells with stem-like properties. Among them, expression of PKC-a, MET, and CDK6
correlated with poorer survival outcomes. In cases coexpressing two of these three kinases, survival rates were
lower than in cases where only one of these kinases was expressed. In functional tests, two-drug combinations
targeting these three kinases inhibited TNBC cell proliferation and tumorigenic potential in a cooperative
manner. A combination of PKC-a-MET inhibitors also attenuated tumor growth in a cooperative manner in vivo.
Our ﬁndings deﬁne three kinases critical for TNBC growth and offer a preclinical rationale for their candidacy as
effective therapeutic targets in treating TNBC. Cancer Res; 74(17); 4822–35. 2014 AACR.

Introduction
Breast cancers are typically classiﬁed into several subtypes:
Luminal A and B subtypes of breast cancer that correspond to
pathologic estrogen receptor (ER)-positive tumors, the HER2
subtype that corresponds to HER2-overexpressing tumors, and
triple-negative/basal-like breast cancer (TNBC/BLBC). BLBC
makes up about 15% to 20% of breast cancers. Recent studies
using clinical samples indicate that BLBC shares more than

80% similarity with TNBC, which is negative for ER, progesterone receptor (PR), and HER2 expression (1). In addition, two
major subgroups of TNBC characterized on the basis of gene
ontologies and differential gene expression proﬁle have been
reported: basal-like TNBC driven by genes enriched in cell
cycle, cell division, and DNA damage response; and mesenchymal-like driven by genes involved in cell motility, cell
differentiation, and growth factor pathways (2). These ﬁndings
indicate that TNBCs are highly heterogeneous. Although subtyping allows for better prediction of the response of each
subtype to speciﬁc molecular targets, the therapeutic beneﬁts
in clinical trial are still unclear. Here, we will use TNBC as a
general term to broadly represent the TNBC/BLBC subtype.
Patients with TNBC initially respond to conventional chemotherapy, but the disease frequently relapses and leads to
worse outcome than patients with hormone receptor-positive
subtypes (3). The low survival rate of patients with TNBC is also
due to high metastasis rates and lack of effective treatment
after a relapse (4). Currently, no effective targeted therapies are
available for patients with TNBC because of TNBC's lack of
expression of hormone receptors and HER2 ampliﬁcation (1, 5).
A cancer stem cell (CSC) or tumor-initiating cell (TIC)
hypothesis has been proposed to account for treatment failure
and recurrence in patients with TNBC (6). Breast TICs (BTIC)
make up a small subpopulation of cells inside tumors that are
resistant to conventional therapy and are capable of reinitiating tumor growth after treatment (7–9); these cells can be
enriched by ﬂow cytometry using speciﬁc cell-surface markers
such as CD44þ and CD24/low (10) and ALDH1high (11). Accumulating evidence suggests that BTICs are responsible for
tumor initiation, progression, and drug resistance (12, 13).

treatment may contain a high proportion of cells with both
tumor-initiating and mesenchymal features (7, 14). In line with
these BTIC features, TNBC also exhibits stem cell signatures
and epithelial–mesenchymal transition characteristics with
high expression of mesenchymal markers (1, 15). We hypothesized that BTICs and disease recurrence may activate common pathways and contribute to the resistance of TNBC.
On the basis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) analysis,
the mutation rates of genes other than TP53 (80%) or PIK3CA
(9%) are less than 5% in TNBC (16). However, there is no
effective way to address loss/mutations of p53 in the clinic at
this moment, and the effects of the PI3K pathway inhibitors in
clinical trials are yet to be seen (17–20). miRNA-regulated gene
expression has been implicated in cancer progression (21),
suggesting that in addition to DNA alteration (mutation or
ampliﬁcation), miRNA regulation may contribute to TNBC
progression by turning on certain oncogenic gene expression.
To ﬁnd other novel therapeutic targets, we performed an
unbiased two-stage bioinformatics analysis (cell and patient
based) of TNBC/BTIC (mRNA and miRNA) databases and of
patient survival data to identify key oncogenic molecules in
TNBC, with a particular focus on those targeted by drugs that
are currently in oncology clinical trials. Through this analysis,
we identiﬁed eight kinases linking TNBC and CSCs.

Materials and Methods
Drugs
Crizotinib was purchased from LC Laboratories (C-7900),
saﬁngol from Matreya LLC (1807) or Sigma (D4681), L-threodihydrosphingosine from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (CAS
73938-69-9), and PD-0332991 from Sigma (PZ0199).
Cell lines
MDA-MB-231, Hs578T, BT549, MDA-MB-468, T47D, MCF7,
and SK-BR-3 cells were grown in DMEM-F12 medium (Caisson
Laboratories, Inc.) supplemented with 10% FBS, penicillin
(50 U/mL), and streptomycin (50 U/mL). Immortal normal
mammary epithelial cells (MCF10A) were cultured in DMEMF12 medium supplemented with 5% horse serum, penicillin
(50 U/mL), streptomycin (50 U/mL), EGF (20 ng/mL), insulin
(10 mg/mL), cholera toxin (1 ng/mL), and hydrocortisone. BT20
cells were grown in DMEM medium (Caisson Laboratories,
Inc.) supplemented with 10% FBS, penicillin (50 U/mL), streptomycin (50 U/mL), and nonessential amino acids. Cell lines
were validated by short tandem repeat (STR) DNA ﬁngerprinting using the AmpFLSTR Identiﬁler Kit according to the
manufacturer's instructions (Applied Biosystems catalog no.
4322288). The STR proﬁles were compared with known American Type Culture Collection ﬁngerprints (ATCC.org) and with
data in the Cell Line Integrated Molecular Authentication
database version 0.1.200808 (22). The STR proﬁles matched
known DNA ﬁngerprints or were unique.
Analysis of public gene expression data
The following databases were used to compare TNBC data
with non-TNBC data: E-MTAB-327 (miRNA expression proﬁling by array of NCI-60 human cancer cell lines), GSE25037
(miRNA expression proﬁling in CD44þ/CD24/low and non-

www.aacrjournals.org

CD44þ/CD24/low human mammary epithelial cell populations), Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) data on breast
cancer cell mRNA expression (23), and GSE7513 (human breast
tumor sample data were sorted to select cells that were
CD44þ/CD24/low). The log2 ratio of TNBC versus non-TNBC
data from public microarray databases was determined using
NetWalker software (24). Gene expression proﬁles, pathways,
and cross-talk were analyzed with the Ingenuity Pathway
Analysis System.
Hierarchical clustering
Clustering was analyzed with an integrated pair of programs, Cluster and TreeView (25), for analyzing and visualizing
the results of complex microarray experiments, and the median adjusted values were used to create expression ﬁles. The
hierarchical clustering algorithm used is based closely on the
average-linkage method of Sokal and colleagues (26). For any
set of TNBC-related kinases, an upper-diagonal similarity
matrix was computed by using average-linkage clustering,
which contained similar scores for all pairs of genes. This
algorithm was determined by computing a dendrogram assembling all elements into a single tree, as described by Eisen and
colleagues (25). The software application of this algorithm was
obtained from M.B. Eisen Department of Molecular and Cell
Biology, University of California Berkeley, Berkeley, CA (25).
Display
The heatmap was represented graphically by coloring each
cell on the basis of the measured ﬂuorescence ratio. Log ratios
of 0 (a ratio of 1.0 indicates that the genes are unchanged) were
colored in black, positive log ratios were colored in red, and
negative log ratios were colored in green (with darker colors
corresponding to higher ratios).
qRT-PCR
Total RNAs from different breast cancer cells were extracted
by using the RNeasy Kit (Qiagen). RNAs were reverse transcribed by using the Superscript II Kit (Invitrogen). RT-PCR
was then performed using the iCycler (Bio-Rad). RNA levels
were quantitated and normalized to GAPDH by subtracting the
cycling threshold for the control from the cycling threshold for
the target. Primers were as follows:

Western blotting
Western blotting was carried out as described previously
(27) with anti-LYN (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-MAP4K4
(GeneTex), anti-FYN (Cell Signaling Technology), anti-MET
(Cell Signaling Technology), anti-RPS6KA3 (Cell Signaling
Technology), anti-PRKCA (BD Biosciences), anti-CDK6
(Abcam), and anti-PIK3CD (GeneTex) antibodies. The membranes were stripped and reprobed with an anti-a-tubulin
mouse monoclonal antibody (Sigma) as a loading control.
Patient overall survival analysis
The NKI-295 database (28) was used for analysis of TNBCrelated gene expression and overall survival. A gene expression
level within the ﬁrst quartile was deﬁned as positive. Survival
curves were estimated by the Kaplan–Meier method, and
survival rates in different groups were compared by the logrank test. The data were analyzed using statistical software
SPSS version 17.0. A P value  0.05 was deﬁned as statistically
signiﬁcant.
Cell viability assay
Cells were seeded in 96-well plates at an initial density of
2  103 per well. At each time point, cells were stained with 100
mL of sterile MTT (0.5 mg/mL; Sigma) for 2 hours at 37 C,
followed by removal of the culture medium and addition of
100 mL of dimethyl sulfoxide. Absorbance was measured at
570 nm, using 655 nm as the reference wavelength. All experiments were carried out in triplicate.
Anchorage-independent colony growth
Two thousand cells were trypsinized and suspended in 2 mL
of complete medium plus 0.3% agar (Sigma). The cell/agar
mixture was plated on top of a layer of 1% agar in complete
medium. After 21 days, viable colonies that were larger than 0.1
or 0.05 mm in diameter were counted using ImageJ software.
Experiments were carried out for each cell line in triplicate.
Colony formation assay
Cells were plated in 6-well plates (2–5  102 cells/well) and
cultured for 10 days. Colonies were stained with 1% crystal
violet for 10 minutes after ﬁxation with 4% paraformaldehyde
for 5 minutes.
Dual-drug combination assay
Breast cancer cells were plated in 96-well plates (BD
Biosciences) and treated with various concentrations of kinase
inhibitors, either alone or in combination, for 48 hours. Cell
viability was determined using the MTT assay. Synergistic
effects were determined by using the Chou–Talalay method
to calculate the combination index (CI; ref. 29).
Flow-cytometric analysis
Cells were harvested, washed with cold PBS, and processed
for CD24 and CD44 surface markers. Allophycocyanin-conjugated anti-CD44 (BD Biosciences) and phycoerythrin-conju-

4824

Cancer Res; 74(17) September 1, 2014

gated anti-CD24 (BD Biosciences) antibodies were used. To
measure the levels of CD44þ/CD24/low cells, MDA-MB-231,
MCF7, and BT20 cells stained with ﬂuorescein isothiocyanateconjugated anti-CD44 antibody and phycoerythrin-conjugated
anti-CD24 antibody (both at 1:50) were sorted at the Flow
Cytometry and Cellular Imaging Core Facility of The University
of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center (Houston, TX).
Mouse studies
All animal procedures were conducted under the guidelines
approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee
at MD Anderson Cancer Center. Athymic mice (Harlan Laboratories) were used as hosts for tumor xenografts. MDA-MB231 cells with luciferase and GFP expression were used for
tumor injection. Mice were divided according to the mean
tumor volume in each group when the diameter of tumor size
reached 4 mm. On the basis of our experience with in vitro
tumorigenic analyses (Fig. 6A and B), we observed synergism
when at least one single kinase inhibitor reached 50% of cell
killing effect. To ﬁnd synergistic effect in vivo, the doses of
single-drug treatments were also chosen at 50% inhibition. The
ED50 (50% effective dose) of crizotinib and saﬁngol was estimated by a dose-titration experiment (data not shown) and
comparable with previous reports in other cancer cell lines
(28, 29). Crizotinib was prepared by dissolving the drug in
50 mmol/L sodium acetate buffer (pH 4.6; ref. 30) and administered orally at 8 mg/kg every other day (31). L-threo-dihydrosphingosine was prepared by dissolving the drug in 5% dextrose containing lactic acid, with pH adjusted to 4.4 (32), and
was injected intravenously at 20 mg/kg twice a week (33).
Tumors were measured twice weekly with a caliper, and tumor
volume was calculated as (width2  length)/2. Tumor volume
measured during drug treatment was normalized to the volume before treatment. The CI was calculated as survival
rate(drugs A þ B)/(survival rate(drug A)  survival rate(drug B)).
Patient tissue samples
The TNBC specimens (n ¼ 107) used for our IHC and survival
analyses were originally obtained from patients undergoing
surgical resection of breast cancer as primary treatment at MD
Anderson Cancer Center or Mackay Memorial Hospital (Taipei, Taiwan) between 1995 and 2009. The specimens were used
in accordance with the protocols approved by the Institutional
Review Board of MD Anderson Cancer Center. Written
informed consent was obtained from patients in all cases at
the time of resection.

Results
Eight TNBC-related kinases are commonly
overexpressed in TNBC subtypes and BTIC populations
To identify cancer-related kinases that are overexpressed in
TNBC and BTICs, we performed a two-stage bioinformatics
analysis of both cell line data and patient data. The study
design is outlined in Fig. 1A. The ﬁrst stage was a cell-based
analysis of data from two mRNA databases (14, 23) and two
miRNA databases (34, 35) to identify oncogenes involved in
TNBC. Breast cancer gene expression proﬁle data were from
the CCLE (23) and NCI-60 datasets (34), and BTIC gene

expression proﬁle data were from isolated human breast
tumors (14), a mammary epithelial cell line, and primary
human mammalian epithelial cells (35), representing the
heterogeneity of TNBC. We focused on cancer-related
kinases, as they are ideal drug targets, and by ﬁltering
miRNA targets with the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis System,
we identiﬁed 23 kinases that were predicted to be upregulated in BTICs and TNBC (Table 1). We then validated the
mRNA expression patterns of these 23 kinases by hierarchical clustering of expression levels in 56 breast cancer cell
lines (CCLE) and identiﬁed thirteen kinases that had higher
expression in TNBC cell lines (n ¼ 26) than in non-TNBC cell
lines (n ¼ 30; Fig. 1B).
To determine whether these thirteen kinases are associated
with a speciﬁc TNBC subgroup, we examined their expression
levels in 20 TNBC cell lines, including 10 basal-like, 8 mesenchymal-like, and 2 unclassiﬁed, according to previously published criteria (2). We found that the average expression levels
of these thirteen kinases were elevated in one unclassiﬁed, six
of ten basal-like, and all eight mesenchymal-like TNBC subtypes compared with expression levels in the luminal breast
cancer subtype (Fig. 1C). The results indicated that mRNA
expression levels of these 13 kinases are higher in most TNBCs
tested, especially in the mesenchymal-like subtype.

To validate the above ﬁndings, we compared the mRNA and
protein expression levels of the 13 kinases in breast cancer cell
lines; among these, the mRNA expression levels of eight (CDK6,
FYN, LYN, MET, PRKCA, RPS6KA3, MAP4K4, and PIK3CD) were
signiﬁcantly higher in at least two of four TNBC cell lines
(BT549, Hs578T, MDA-MB-231, and MDA-MB-468) compared
with expression levels in a non-TNBC cell line (T47D; Fig. 2A
and Supplementary Fig. S1). Western blot analysis indicated
that expression levels of MET, PKC-a (from PRKCA), RSK-2
(from RPS6KA3), LYN, FYN, and CDK6 were higher in most of
the six TNBC cell lines tested than in six non-TNBC cell lines
(Fig. 2B). Although the levels of PIK3CD (which encodes PI3K d)
and MAP4K4 mRNA were higher in TNBC cell lines than in nonTNBC cell lines, the protein expression levels were not. Generally, the protein levels of these kinases were overexpressed in
most TNBC cell lines tested; therefore, they served as a basis for
further experimental analysis.
To evaluate the expression levels of the eight kinases in
BTICs, we isolated CD44þ/CD24/low stem cells from a TNBC
cell line (BT20) by ﬂow cytometry. CDK6, LYN, MAP4K4, MET,
PIK3CD, PRKCA, and RPS6KA3 mRNA levels were upregulated
in the isolated CD44þ/CD24/low subpopulations from
TNBC cell line (BT20 cells; Fig. 2C) compared with the levels
in CD44low/CD24þ nonstem cells. Interestingly, FYN, LYN,

We used ERBB2, ESR1 (which encodes ER), and PGR (which
encodes PR) gene expression patterns to distinguish TNBC
patients from non-TNBC patients. The hierarchical clustering algorithm used is based closely on the average-linkage
method, indicating that the mRNA expression levels of the
eight TNBC-related kinases highly correlated with TNBC
(Fig. 3A). Box plots were generated from the original log2
-transformed mRNA expression levels of the eight kinases by
breast cancer subtype on the basis of the mRNA expression
levels of ESR1, PGR, and ERBB2. These ﬁndings indicate that
expression of the TNBC-related kinases is strongly associated with TNBC versus non-TNBC (Fig. 3B). The histogram

and non-TNBC tumors (Fig. 3C). Taken together, the results
of both cell and patient database analyses suggest that

To identify the most suitable therapeutic targets among the
eight TNBC-related kinases for TNBC, we analyzed the relationship between the TNBC-related kinases and overall survival in patients with breast cancer. Using an online Kaplan–
Meier plotter (36), three out of the eight kinases (PRKCA, MET,
and CDK6) that showed high expression were associated with
shorter overall survival in patients with TNBC (P ¼ 0.019, 0.02,
and 0.073, respectively; Fig. 4A and data not shown) based on
the univariate analysis with selected probes. Consistently,
another data analysis from breast cancer cohort NKI-295
(28) with selected cutoffs also indicated that PRKCA, MET,

and CDK6 expression levels were correlated with worse overall
survival (P ¼ 0.003, 0.086, and 0.002, respectively; Fig. 4B).
Furthermore, high expression of PRKCA/MET (P ¼ 0.018),
PRKCA/CDK6 (P < 0.0001), or CDK6/MET (P ¼ 0.005) correlated
with more adverse survival outcomes than each one alone in
patients with breast cancer (Fig. 4C). Interestingly, the survival
rates of patients with breast cancer in whom three kinases

PRKCA/MET/CDK6 were coexpressed were not worse than in
whom two kinases were coexpressed (data not shown), providing a rationale to investigate whether the dual-drug combinations sufﬁciently impede TNBC progression. Together,
these results suggest that expression of PRKCA, MET, or CDK6
has the potential to serve as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target for breast cancer, especially TNBC.

Dual-drug combinations of PKC-a, MET, and CDK6
inhibitors synergistically inhibit TNBC cell proliferation
Given that expression of two of the three kinases PKC-a,
MET, and CDK6 was more highly correlated with patient
survival than was expression of any one of the three kinases
alone and that PRKCA/MET/CDK6 were not worse than in
whom two kinases were coexpressed, we investigated the antiTNBC efﬁcacies of dual-drug combinations of saﬁngol (a PKCa and sphingosine kinase 1 inhibitor), crizotinib (a MET inhibitor), and PD0332991 (a CDK4/6 inhibitor)—drugs that either
are in clinical trials or have been approved by the Food and
Drug Administration (and therefore could be readily tested in
combination in clinical trials). As shown in Fig. 5A, when two of
the three kinase inhibitors were combined, the synergistic
cytotoxic effects seemed to be higher in TNBC cells than in
non-TNBC cells. In addition, normal epithelial cells (MCF10A)
exhibited more resistance of all the dual-drug combinations
under similar treatments conditions, suggesting that these
dual-drug combinations preferentially kill TNBC cells over
non-TNBC cancer cells or normal breast epithelial cells. To
further demonstrate whether CSC population is more sensitive
to the combination therapy, drug-treated MDA-MB-231
cells were subjected to FACS to determine the percentage of
CD44þ/CD24/low population and assess the cells' ability to
form mammospheres. As shown in Supplementary Fig. S2A,
MDA-MB-231 cells treated with DMSO contained 81  5%
CD44þ/CD24/low population, whereas those treated with
combination of saﬁngol–crizotinib, saﬁngol–PD0332991, or
crizotinib–PD0332991 contained signiﬁcantly less (34 
12%, 24  12%, or 26  10%, respectively). In addition, all
three combinations and single drug treatments caused a
decrease in mammosphere formation (Supplementary Fig.
S2B). Taken together, these ﬁndings support the notion that
the stem-like MDA-MB-231 cells were more sensitive to these
three dual-drug combinations than their non-stem like
counterparts.
To further validate the synergistic killing effects of dual-drug
combinations targeting PKC-a, MET, and CDK6, we carried
out drug interaction analysis using the Chou–Talalay method
to determine the CI (37). TNBC cells were treated with saﬁngol,
crizotinib, or PD0332991 alone or in combination (saﬁngol plus
crizotinib, saﬁngol plus PD0332991, or crizotinib plus
PD0332991) at various concentrations. The CIs of the dual
drug combinations are shown in Fig. 5B; CI values of <1, 1, and
>1 indicate that the two drugs in the combination have
synergistic, additive, or antagonistic effects, respectively. All
three dual-drug combinations synergistically inhibited TNBC
cell proliferation, especially at the highest EDs, which killed
most cancer cells. The greatest synergism (CI) for the saﬁngol–
crizotinib combination was observed in MDA-MB-231 and
BT549 cells at 95% EDs with CI values of 0.35 and 0.15,
respectively. However, for the crizotinib-PD0332991 combination, the greatest synergism observed in MDA-MB-231 and
Hs578T cells was only at 50% EDs with CI values of 0.39 and
0.53, respectively (Table 2). According to these results, the
combination with the best therapeutic effect was saﬁngol–
crizotinib with the strongest synergism, followed by saﬁngol–
PD0332991 and crizotinib–PD0332991 in that order. Interest-

4830

ingly, the saﬁngol–crizotinib combination treatment also
showed a slight synergism in non-TNBC cancer cells (0.82 at
95% EDs in T47D cells) and strong antagonistic effect in normal
epithelial cells. These ﬁndings further indicate that these dualdrug combinations, especially saﬁngol–crizotinib, may be
effective against TNBC progression.
Combined inhibition of PKC-a and MET suppresses
TNBC tumorigenesis in vitro and in vivo
Next, we examined the effects of the dual drug combinations
on the tumorigenic potential of TNBC cells. All three combinations efﬁciently inhibited colony-forming ability in BT549 cells
(Fig. 6A). Saﬁngol combined with crizotinib or PD0332991
suppressed anchorage-independent colony formation more
efﬁciently than did any one of the drugs by itself in both
MDA-MB-231 and BT549 cells (Fig. 6B). However, crizotinib
combined with PD0332991 did not inhibit anchorage-independent growth more efﬁciently than PD0332991 alone; suggesting
that inhibition of PKC-a activity is required for optimal killing
of TNBC cells. Indeed, PKC-a was recently identiﬁed as a
central signaling node in non-CSC to CSC transformation and
has been proposed as a potential therapeutic target for breast
cancer (38). We further examined PKC-a expression and
patient outcomes with a TNBC tissue microarray by IHC
analysis, with results indicating that the survival rate was
worse in patients with TNBC with high levels of PKC-a
expression than those with low levels (P ¼ 0.045; Fig. 6C).
Collectively, our ﬁndings suggest that PKC-a is a unique
prognostic indicator of TNBC patient survival.
Given that the saﬁngol–crizotinib combination consistently showed synergistic killing effect from multiple in vitro
assays, we further evaluated the efﬁcacy of the saﬁngol–
crizotinib combination in a TNBC orthotopic xenograft
mouse model. In agreement with results from our in vitro
assays, the saﬁngol–crizotinib combination was more effective in reducing tumor growth than was either single-drug
treatment or vehicle control treatment (Fig. 6D). The inhibition efﬁciency in mice was 68% for the combination (CI ¼
0.43) but only 6% (P ¼ 0.006) and 21% (P ¼ 0.002) for
saﬁngol alone and crizotinib alone, respectively. We did not
observe any signiﬁcant body weight changes when mice
were treated with the saﬁngol or crizotinib alone or in
combination (Fig. 6E). These results suggest that the dualdrug combination of PKC-a with MET may be effective
against TNBC and could be readily applied for markerguided clinical trials as inhibitors of the TNBC-related
kinases are available in clinical trials or have been approved
by FDA.

Discussion
Our analysis with multiple cell line and patient databases
identiﬁed eight TNBC-related kinases—MET, FYN, PKC-a,
MAP4K4, LYN, PI3K d, CDK6, and RSK-2—that are commonly overexpressed in TNBC/BTICs. Of these eight kinases,
PKC-a, MET, and CDK6 associated with the worst
survival outcomes in patients with breast cancer. Dual-drug
combinations that target these three kinases synergistically
inhibited TNBC cell proliferation and in vitro tumorigenic

involved in the detection and repair of DNA damage (39). There
are at least ﬁve PARP inhibitors that are in clinical trials, and
among them, BSI-201 (iniparib; ref. 40) and AZD2281 (olaparib;
ref. 41) have been evaluated in multiple clinical trials in women
with metastatic breast cancer. However, the results indicated
that the reduced rate of tumor regression was observed mostly
in patients with the BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations (42). Thus,
efﬁcacy of PARP inhibitors in patients with TNBC is still
nuclear (43). Recent encouraging data showed that inhibition
of PI3K impairs DNA homologous recombination and sensitizes TNBC without BRCA mutations to poly(ADP-ribose)
inhibition (44). However, this mechanism has yet to be tested
in patients, and important questions remain unanswered.
TNBC is the most heterogeneous subtype of breast cancer,
and because no individual cell line represents the heterogeneity of TNBC, it is difﬁcult to ﬁnd an appropriate TNBC model.
The well-established cell-based systems, such as the BPLER
cancer cell line derived from human primary breast epithelial
cells, have a TNBC-like phenotype in vitro and are highly
enriched for BTICs (45). Although BPLER mimics TNBC, this
system is most appropriate for the basal-like TNBC subtype,
which accounts for about half of the TNBC cases (46). In

identifying 13 TNBC-related kinases that are expressed in most
TNBC subtypes (Fig. 1C), including the basal-like and mesenchymal-like subtypes, our study overcame some of the limitations associated with TNBC heterogeneity.
In the absence of major growth stimulation on their surface,
TNBC cells may rely on downstream signaling to compensate
for the loss of cell-surface signaling to support cell growth.
Kinases are ideal target molecules, as they transmit signals,
control complex cellular processes, and are frequently activated in cancer by mutation, constitutive activation, or overexpression. A gene expression proﬁling study of 102 human
breast tumors identiﬁed several kinases as druggable targets in
ER-negative breast cancer (47). The identiﬁcation of LYN,
MAP4K4, MET, and RPS6KA3 kinases in both that study
and ours suggests that these kinases are common regulators
in TNBC. We further showed that dual-drug combinations
using PKC-a, CDK6, and MET kinase inhibitors enhanced the
killing on TNBC cells, reduced the tumorigenic phenotype
of cells in vitro, and synergistically impeded tumor growth
in vivo. These results further attest to the critical role these
kinases play in transmitting oncogenic signaling in TNBC. It
may be worthwhile to test the efﬁcacy of other dual-drug

Figure 6. Dual-drug combinations of PKC-a, MET, and CDK6 inhibitors synergistically suppressed clonogenic and anchorage-independent growth in vitro and
in an animal model. A, the number of colony-forming cells was determined by clonogenic assay in BT549. Cells were treated with saﬁngol (Sa; 0.75 mmol/L),
crizotinib (Cr; 0.75 mmol/L), and PD0332991 (PD; 0.75 mmol/L), separately or in combination, for 10 days. B, the number of colony-forming cells was
determined by anchorage-independent growth analysis in MDA-MB-231 and BT549 cells. Cells were treated with saﬁngol (0.5 mmol/L), crizotinib (0.5 mmol/L),
and PD0332991 (0.2 mmol/L), separately or in combination, for 21 days. Representative images from the clonogenic and anchorage-independent
growth assays (carried out as described in Materials and Methods) are shown. The data on the right are means with SDs for three independent experiments.  , P

combinations in an animal model. However, our ﬁndings
indicate that the combination of PKC-a and MET inhibitors
is efﬁcacious against tumors in mice and should be tested in
patients with TNBC.
Our study, together with the previous reports, suggests that
PKC-a plays an important role in both TNBC and BTICs. An
inverse relationship between PKC-a activity and ER expression
in human breast cell lines and tumors was ﬁrmly established
over 25 years ago, with ER-negative cells expressing signiﬁcantly higher levels of PKC-a than the levels expressed in ERpositive cancer cells (48). PKC-a overexpression has also been
suggested to play a role in growth signaling when breast cancer
shifts from hormone dependence to hormone independence
(49). More recently, PDGFR/PKC-a/FRA1 signaling was identiﬁed upon activation of epithelial–mesenchymal transition

from nonCSCs to CSCs, and inhibition of either PKC-a or FRA1
was suggested to have potential therapeutic value in aggressive
breast cancer (38). Although the role of PKC-a in breast cancer
has been established, none of the clinical trials using PKC-a
inhibitors speciﬁcally targeted TNBC, ER-negative breast cancer, or metastatic breast cancer. Our study has demonstrated
an association between PKC-a and TNBC both in cell lines and
in patient tumors, and our ﬁndings indicate that PKC-a is a
unique prognostic marker and a potential therapeutic target
for TNBC.
