ABSTRACT:
Temozolomide (TMZ) is an alkylating agent used for the treatment of glioblastoma
multiforme (GBM), the main form of human brain tumours in adults. It has been
reported that TMZ induced DNA lesions that subsequently trigger cell death but the
actual mechanisms involved in the process are still unclear. We investigated the
implication of major proteins of the Bcl-2 family in TMZ-induced cell death in GBM
cell lines at concentrations closed to that reached in the brain during the treatments.
We did not observe modulation of autophagy at these concentrations but we found
an induction of apoptosis. Using RNA interference, we showed that TMZ induced
apoptosis is dependent on the pro-apoptotic protein Bak but independent of the proapoptotic protein Bax. Apoptosis was not enhanced by ABT-737, an inhibitor of Bcl2/Bcl-Xl/Bcl-W but not Mcl-1. The knock-down of Mcl-1 expression increased TMZ
induced apoptosis. Our results identify a Mcl-1/Bak axis for TMZ induced apoptosis
in GBM and thus unravel a target to overcome therapeutic resistance toward TMZ.

INTRODUCTION

in DNA repair [4]. However, both in vitro and in vivo,
cell death triggered by TMZ at therapeutic doses is still
low even in MGMT silenced tumours [3]. This means
that other factors, which are currently not known, are
probably involved in GBM resistance. The precise
mechanism of cell death triggered by TMZ, is still subject
to controversial discussion and studies of the association
of TMZ with other drugs indeed revealed a complex array
of mechanisms implicated in TMZ cytotoxicity [5]. It has
been reported that TMZ through the production of O6methylguanine was inducing apoptosis [6]. However, the
actual apoptotic mechanism triggering and amplifying the
response to TMZ is still unknown as contradictory results
have been published (see for example references 7 and 8).
Moreover the importance of apoptosis has been challenged
by others who observed predominantly an induction of
autophagy after TMZ treatment of glioma cell lines [9].
Apoptosis and autophagy are both cell death programs
but the latter is also an essential component of cellular
survival mechanism which plays an important role in

Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), the most common
form of brain cancer in the adults, are highly resistant to
current treatments. The 2-year survival rate remains low as
most of the tumours recur despite the aggressive treatment
combining surgery, radio and chemotherapy [1]. Recently,
the introduction of temozolomide (TMZ) in association
with radiotherapy in the treatment of GBM has produced
a small but significant over all survival in a subset of
patients [2]. The cytotoxicity of TMZ is mainly mediated
by the generation of O6methylguanine in DNA, which
triggers cell cycle dependent DNA damage and ensuing
cell death [3]. The expression of O6-methylguanine-DNA
methyl transferase (MGMT) limits TMZ therapeutic
efficacy by removing O6-methylguanine [4].
So far, the only prognostic/predictive factor for
longer survival after TMZ treatment is the partial or total
silencing of MGMT through methylation of its gene
promoter which favours TMZ induced major defects

cancer [10]. TMZ was although shown to induce mitotic
catastrophe in p53-deficient glioma cells [11]. Additional
signalling pathways have been associated with TMZ
cytotoxicity such as G2/M check point integrity [12], upregulation of miR-21 [13], induction of senescence [11,
14], and elevated AMP-activated Protein Kinase [15].
However, in most of these studies, the concentrations
of TMZ used were far greater than that achieved during
GBM treatment (i.e.≥ 50 µM) and thus did not necessarily
reflect TMZ actual toxicity in patients. We thus decided
to evaluate the implication of proteins of the Bcl-2 family
at TMZ therapeutic doses [16] as members of this family
are central in the control of both apoptosis and autophagy
downstream of DNA damage [17-21].

moderately increased after incubation for 3 days with
both TMZ concentrations (i.e. 12.5 and 50 µM) (Figure
1A). In cells treated for up to 72 hrs in the continuous
presence of TMZ, apoptosis was quantified every 24 hrs
by measuring caspase 3 activity (i.e. DEVDase activity) as
described in materials and methods. As showed in Figure
1B, caspase activity was only increased after 72 hrs at 12.5
and 50 µM TMZ. In presence of the inhibitor of DEVDase
activity (DEVD-CHO), no caspase activity was observed
(Figure S1). Block in G2/M has been proposed as the
main effect of TMZ on glioma [11]. As shown in Figure
1C, TMZ induced a block in G2/M in U251 cell line at
both concentrations with similar amplitude. At higher
dose (i.e. 100 µM), it has been reported that TMZ induced
autophagy, but not apoptosis in malignant glioma cells
[9]. Autophagy can be monitored by the analysis of the
conversion of soluble LC3-I to lipid bound LC3-II which
is associated with the formation of autophagosomes.
We used LC3 antibodies to detect autophagy. As shown
in Figure 1D, the incubation of U251 with 50 µM TMZ
did not trigger autophagy. Similar results were obtained
with other markers of autophagy such as autophagosome
labelling with monodansylpentane (MDH) and
degradation of p62/ SQSTM1, a LC3-II partner (data not
shown). From these results, we conclude that apoptosis
would prevail over autophagy at TMZ concentrations
inferior to 100 µM.

RESULTS
Effect of TMZ on the induction of cell death and
cell cycle in glioma cell lines
We used a human glioma cell line which does not
express MGMT, U251, but with a mutant p53 status. We
used TMZ concentrations up to 50 µM, concentration
closed to the AUC in brain (31+/-6.2µM/l/h) as described
by Ostermann et al. [16]. To analyze cell death after
TMZ treatment, we used a LDH assay (see materials and
methods). The LDH activity in the supernatant was only

Role of Bcl-2 , Bcl-Xl and Mcl-1 in U251 response
to TMZ

Mcl-1 in TMZ induced cell death, we treated the cells
with Si-RNAs designed to inhibit the expression of Mcl-1
(Figure S2A). As illustrated in Figure 2D, the silencing
of Mcl-1 enhanced apoptosis induced by TMZ in U251
cell line even at the lowest concentration (i.e. 12.5 µM),
when the amount of Mcl-1 was not affected by the drug
(Figure S2A). Of note, at the higher concentration (i.e. 50
µM), all cells with silenced Mcl-1 were killed by the TMZ
treatment (data not shown).
These results showed for the first time that Mcl-1
play an important role in TMZ induced apoptosis.

Bcl-2 family members are regulators of apoptosis
[18]. We thus analyzed the expression of several key
members of the Bcl-2 family after TMZ treatment at 12.5
or 50 µM: namely Mcl-1 and Bcl-2, two anti-apoptotic
members of the Bcl-2 family and Bax and Bak, two proapoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family. As illustrated in
Figure 2A, the expression of mRNA encoding for Bcl-2,
quantified by Q-PCR (see materials and methods) was
significantly increased in cells surviving TMZ treatment
(i.e. living cells) at 50 µM after 48 and 72 hrs. On the
other hand, little or no differences were observed for the
expression of Mcl-1, Bax and Bak after the treatment
(Figure 2A). Next, we examined the expression of these
proteins by immunoblots. As illustrated in Figure 2B,
TMZ did not induce any change in the expression of
Bax and Bak at the protein level. On the other hand,
the expression of Bcl-2 was increased and that of Mcl1 considerably reduced during the treatment. Several
small molecules have been selected on the basis of their
anti-Bcl-2 activity and among them ABT-737 has been
shown to be a more potent inhibitor of Bcl-2/Bcl-Xl/
Bcl-W but not of Mcl-1 [22]. The treatment of U251
cell line with ABT-737 in the presence of TMZ, did not
affect apoptosis significantly (Figure 2C), ruling out the
involvement of Bcl-2/Bcl-Xl/ Bcl-W in the inhibition of
TMZ induced apoptosis. To examine the importance of

Role of Bax and Bak in U251 response to TMZ
The expression of Bax and Bak did not appear to be
modulated by TMZ treatment. However these proteins,
depending on the nature of the death inducing agent, do
not exhibit similar sensitivities or implications during
apoptosis [23]. To examine the role each of these proteins
play in TMZ response we knocked down the expression
of Bax or Bak in U251 by RNA interference (Figure
S2B and C). When Sh-Bax treated cells were incubated
with TMZ, we observed little or no influence on induced
apoptosis (Figure 3A). Conversely, the knock down of Bak
expression significantly decreased the induction of caspase
activity by TMZ treatment (Figure 3B). Of note, in shBak treated cells, a slight decreased in necrosis related
cytotoxicity was observed as shown by LDH activity
measurements (Figure 3C). The effect of Bak on apoptosis

was not dose dependent (Figure 3D) and no effect on cell
cycling was observed in TMZ treated control and Sh-Bak
or Bax U251 cells (data not shown).
It has been shown that in TMZ treated glioma cell
line, that repair of O6-methylguanine by MGMT prevented
apoptosis (6). We thus expressed MGMT in U251 cell line
(Figure S3) which otherwise does not express this enzyme.
The expression of MGMT decreased the response of
U251 cells to TMZ as expected (Figure 4). However, the
expression of MGMT in U251 did not change the specific
role of Bak in TMZ toxicity (Figure 4).

survival is mainly restricted to some patients exhibiting
MGMT promoter methylation [4, 24, 25]. Indeed, the
MGMT promoter could be predictive or prognostic for
a sub-group of gliomas that are exhibiting specific gene
methylation profile and/or more sensitive to cell death
induction as suggested by our previous studies [26].
We have particularly shown that a DNA-methylating
factor, such as the folinic acid, induced limited cellular
proliferation and increased the sensitivity to TMZinduced apoptosis in glioma cells [27]. Of note, among
silenced genes, several were implicated in apoptosis
such as survivin, and Bcl-W and others such as MGMT
specifically implicated in DNA repair and response to
TMZ [27].
Despite numerous works, the mechanisms by which
TMZ induce cell death in cancer cells remain elusive.
It has been proposed that the main features of TMZ
cytotoxicity was associated with induction of cell death
or cell cycle arrest [4]. In the present study, we show that
TMZ at a concentration equal or inferior to that achieved
during patients treatment [16], induced a type of cell
death which is quantitatively and qualitatively different
from that described by others at higher concentrations
(i.e. >100 µM). As illustrated in Figure 1, apoptosis
was always limited in treated glioma cell lines. On the
other hand, no or little effect on autophagy was observed
at these TMZ concentrations (Figure 1). However, we
observed that TMZ induced cell death was a mixture of
apoptosis and another cell death programme which remain
to be identified.
Since the Bcl-2 family members are central to most
cell death programmes, we have investigated the roles of
some of its key members in TMZ induced cytotoxicity. It

LN18 exhibited similar Bak/Mcl-1 specificity
toward TMZ induced apoptosis
We analyzed the implication of Bak in TMZ induced
apoptosis in LN18 cells; a PTEN/MGMT positive cell
line. As shown in Figure 5A, the induction of apoptosis
required a concentration of TMZ superior to that observed
for U251 cells (i.e. 250 to 750 µM). The knock down
of the expression of Mcl-1 (Figure S4A) has a deep
influence on TMZ induced apoptosis (Figure 5B) while
that of Bax (Figure S4B) had very little influence on cell
survival except for at the highest concentration (i.e. 750
µM) (Figure 5C). On the other hand, the decrease in the
expression of Bak (Figure S4C) inhibited significantly,
TMZ (at all concentrations) induced apoptosis (Figure
5D).

DISCUSSION
The introduction of TMZ/ irradiation regimen in
the treatment of gliomas has significantly improved the
outcome of patients [1-2]. However, benefit in terms of

MATERIALS AND METHODS

has been reported that TMZ at high concentrations (i.e. >
100 µM) induced a change in the Bax: Bcl-2 ratio which
was instrumental to its cytotoxicity through enhancement
of apoptosis and/or autophagy [6-9]. In this study, we
did not observe any change in the expression of Mcl-1,
Bax or Bak upon TMZ treatment at lower concentrations.
Pharmacological inhibition of Bcl-2/Bcl-Xl/ Bcl-W by
ABT-737 did not affect cell death under our conditions
while the knock down of the expression of Mcl-1 affected
apoptosis (Figure 2). Similarly, the knock down of Bax
expression did not affect TMZ induced apoptosis while
that of Bak inhibited this cell death programme. This
feature was conserved in the presence of MGMT (Figure
4). Quite remarkably, such a difference was not found
for necrosis-like cell death quantified by the release
of LDH where Bax and Bak appeared to play similar
roles (Figure 1). However, neither Bax nor Bak have an
influence on autophagy upon TMZ treatment (data not
shown). We, and others, have shown distinct roles for Bax
and Bak especially in linking chemotherapeutic drugs or
death receptor pathways to the mitochondrial apoptosis
signalling cascade [23, 28-30]. These differences have
been associated with the extent of the inhibitory effect of
Mcl-1 on Bak [29]. Interestingly, recent results suggest
that the  alkylating DNA-damage agent N-methyl-N’nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG) induced cell death
through a caspase independent but Bax dependent
pathway called necroptosis [31]. Further investigations are
necessary to verify if TMZ under our conditions induced
both a Bax dependent necroptosis and a Bak dependent
apoptosis. Similarly, the implication of members of the
Bcl-2 family should be examined in the new therapeutic
targets that have been recently described [32-36].
Altogether, we have identified in this work a Mcl1/Bak axis implicated in TMZ induced apoptosis in two
different glioma cell lines. These cell lines differ in their
PTEN and MGMT status, two features that influence their
response to TMZ. We also show that upon TMZ treatment
Mcl-1 expression is not modified at the transcriptomic
level but at the protein level.This suggests that targeting
Mcl-1 either by competitive inhibitors of its interaction
with Bak or by promoting its degradation is a potentially
important target in glioma.
In addition, our results suggest that Bax is not
involved in the apoptotic pathway (i.e. activation of
caspase 3) but is nonetheless associated with cytotoxicity
at concentrations that are likely to be reached during
treatment of GBM patients. Thus a better understanding
of this non canonical cell death programme induced by
TMZ might be important to improve the efficacy of GBM
patient’s treatment.

Reagents and Materials.
All reagents were from Sigma except for the
Temozolomide (TMZ) obtained from Interchim (Paris,
France). The stock solution of TMZ in DMSO at 100mM.
Aliquots were frozen at -20°C and dilutions to the
appropriate concentrations were done in culture medium
just before the experiment. The following antibodies were
used: Mcl-1 (sc-819 Santa Cruz), Bax (2D2, Sigma), Bak
(556396- BD-Pharmingen USA), SQSTM1/p62(5114-Cell
Signaling) and LC3B (2775- Cell Signaling), β Tubulin
(T0198-Sigma), αActin (clone C4, MAB1501, Millipore).
Secondary mouse and rabbit antibodies were from Jackson
ImmunoResearch (UK). For MGMT transfection the
plasmid pDEST 12.2 was obtained from In Vitrogen, Life
technologies (CA) and the MGMT cDNA from ATCC,
clone MGC-5186.

Cell culture.
U251 cell line and its derivatives were grown in
high-glucose Dulbecco Modifed Medium enriched with
10% fetal calf serum, antibiotics and glutamine (Life
technologies, Carlsbad, CA). Cells were maintained in
5%CO2 incubator at 37°C.

Cell cycle analysis.
Cells were plated in 6 well-plates, treated with TMZ
for the respective time and collected by trypsinization.
After fixation in 70% alcohol, cells were stained with
propidium iodide (8µg/ml) in presence of RNAseADNAse free (Amresco, Solon, OH). Cells were then
analysed on a BD-Facscan and the Cell Quest software
(BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ).

Cell viability assays.
Cell viability was assayed by MTT [37]. Cells were
seeded in 96 well plates. Next day drugs were added in
100µL at the indicated concentration and plates were
incubated for 72h. Controls contained drug vehicles. MTT
0,5mg/ml was then added and after 4 h at 37°C, medium
was removed and formazan precipitates were dissolved
in DMSO. Optical density was read at 570 nm on a
microplate reader (Molecular Device, CA).

Knockdown experiments.

Western Blot.
Proteins were separated on 12% acrylamide gels
and transferred to Immobillon-P transfert membrane
(Millipore, MA). After 1h incubation with western
blocking reagent (Roche, Germany) the primary antibody
was incubated O/N at 4°C. Secondary antibodies were
applied for 2h at room temperature. Revelation was
performed by chemoluminescence using ECL reagent
(Roche, Germany) and the fusion FX7 Imager (Erlangen,
Germany).

Lentivirus:
Cells were transduced with MISSION® shRNA
Lentiviral Particles against Bax (SHVRS NM_004324.3)
and Bak (SHVRS NM_001188) as recommended by
the manufacturer (Sigma-Aldrich,Saint-Louis, MO).
Five sequences were used and after cell selection with
puromycin (2µg/ml) the one with the best gene inhibition
was selected for experiments. Scramble sequences
(SHC001V ; SHC002V) were used as negative controls.

RNA expression assay.

Si RNA :

Cells were grown in 6-wells plate. After
treatment, adherent cells were collected and RNA and
protein extracted using Nucleospin RNA/Protein kit
(Macherey Nagel, Düren, Germany) according to the
recommendations. DNAse treatment was included in the
protocol.
The quantity and quality of RNA were
respectively evaluated using the NanoDrop® ND-1000
spectrophotometer (Nanodrop Technologies, Wilmington,
DE) and the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyser (Agilent, Santa
Clara, CA). The RNAs extracted were of good quality and
the RNA integrity number (RIN) was >9 in all cases. RNA
expression was quantified as previously described [40]
using the MX3005P, and the mix was the Brilliant II Sybr
Green Master Mix (Agilent, CA). Primers sequences are
given in Table S1. The housekeeping genes were RPLPO
(Ribosomal Protein, Large, PO), and GAPDH .
To insure specificity of the RT-qPCR, an agarose
gel electrophoresis was initially performed to check
whether a single PCR product was generated and then a
melting curve was performed at the end of each RT-qPCR.
Linearity and efficiency of the RT-qPCR were checked for
each gene with a standard curve of 4 logs prepared with
Universal RNA (Stratagene-Agilent, CA). Efficiency was
>90% in all cases.

To inhibit Mcl-1, Silencer si RNAs (120644Ambion, Applied Systems) were transfected in
U251 cell line, with Lipofectamine RNAi Max (Life
technologies) according to the recommended protocol.
Final concentration of si RNA was 10µM. si-RNA-A,
sc-37007 , a non targeted si-RNA (Santa-Cruz, CA), was
used as negative control. After 48h cells were collected
for protein extraction.

Protein extraction.
Cell lysis was done in ice-cold RIPA buffer
containing protease inhibitors, for 20 min. After
centrifugation at 13 000 rpm for 20min, 4°C, protein
concentration in the supernatant was measured by BC
assay (Uptima, Interchim, France). A standard curve using
bovine serum albumin was included in each assay.

Caspase activity.
DEVDase activity was measured in 25µg
proteins with the fluorometric CaspACE assay system
(Promega, WI). To determine the specificity of the assay,
measurements were done in presence of caspase specific
inhibitor DEVD-CHO [38].

Statistical analysis.
Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad
Prism 5 using unpaired t-Test for group comparisons.
Significant differences (p < 0.05) are indicated (*) on
figures.

LDH activity.
LDH activity was measured using the Roche
diagnostic kit (3004732122) on a Cobas 6000 (Roche
Diagnostics GmbH, D-68298, Mannheim). This assay
is based on the measure of NADH appearance after
transformation of lactate from pyruvate by LDH. Control
medium without cells was used as blank.
