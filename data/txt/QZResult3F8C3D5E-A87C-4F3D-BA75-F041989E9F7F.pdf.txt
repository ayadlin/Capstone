Abstract
The identiﬁcation of optimal target antigens on tumor cells is
central to the advancement of new antibody-based cancer
therapies. We performed suppression subtractive hybridization
and identiﬁed nectin-4 (PVRL4), a type I transmembrane protein and member of a family of related immunoglobulin-like
adhesion molecules, as a potential target in epithelial cancers.
We conducted immunohistochemical analysis of 2,394 patient
specimens from bladder, breast, lung, pancreatic, ovarian,
head/neck, and esophageal tumors and found that 69% of all
specimens stained positive for nectin-4. Moderate to strong
staining was especially observed in 60% of bladder and 53% of
breast tumor specimens, whereas the expression of nectin-4 in
normal tissue was more limited. We generated a novel antibody–drug conjugate (ADC) enfortumab vedotin comprising

the human anti-nectin-4 antibody conjugated to the highly
potent microtubule-disrupting agent MMAE. Hybridoma (AGS22M6E) and CHO (ASG-22CE) versions of enfortumab vedotin
(also known as ASG-22ME) ADC were able to bind to cell
surface–expressed nectin-4 with high afﬁnity and induced cell
death in vitro in a dose-dependent manner. Treatment of mouse
xenograft models of human breast, bladder, pancreatic, and
lung cancers with enfortumab vedotin signiﬁcantly inhibited
the growth of all four tumor types and resulted in tumor
regression of breast and bladder xenografts. Overall, these
ﬁndings validate nectin-4 as an attractive therapeutic target in
multiple solid tumors and support further clinical development, investigation, and application of nectin-4–targeting
ADCs. Cancer Res; 76(10); 3003–13. 2016 AACR.

Introduction

Antibody–drug conjugates (ADC) are an emerging class of
targeted therapeutic agents with the ability to deliver a highly
cytotoxic payload to tumor sites by harnessing the exquisite
speciﬁcity of a mAb as a delivery vehicle (4, 5). The ADCs
brentuximab vedotin (Adcetris), which comprises an anti-CD30
mAb conjugated to a microtubule inhibitor, and trastuzumab
emtansine (Kadcyla), which comprises an anti-HER2 mAb conjugated to a microtubule-disrupting agent, received approval from
the FDA for treatment of CD30-positive hematologic cancers (in
patients with classical Hodgkin lymphoma at high risk of relapse
or progression as autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation consolidation and relapsed systemic anaplastic large cell
lymphoma) and HER2-positive breast cancer, respectively. Both
agents demonstrated durable and sustained responses in clinical
trials (6–9).
Using suppression subtractive hybridization, we identiﬁed the
protein nectin-4, also known as poliovirus receptor–related protein 4 (PVRL4), as a potential ADC target, as it showed high mRNA
expression in bladder cancer. Nectin-4 is a member of the nectin
family of immunoglobulin-like adhesion molecules (10–12) that
are proposed to mediate Ca2þ-independent cell–cell adhesion via
both homophilic and heterophilic trans-interactions at adherens
junctions, where they recruit cadherins and modulate cytoskeleton rearrangements (12). On the basis of the differential expression of nectin-4 in bladder cancers, we developed a novel ADC,
enfortumab vedotin, comprising fusion between a fully human

Cancers of epithelial origin represent a signiﬁcant global medical challenge that impacts patients, their families, and the health
care system. Transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) of the bladder, a
commonly diagnosed epithelial cancer, has an incidence rate
estimated at >72,000 cases per year in the United States (1).
Approximately 15,000 patients die annually from the metastatic
form of the disease. Treatment options for metastatic TCC are
quite limited and most were developed decades ago (1, 2). Recent
advances in cancer genomics, such as identiﬁcation of driver
mutations and immune modulators that play a role in TCC, have
motivated the development of targeted therapies that inhibit
growth factors, such as FGFR3 and immune checkpoint proteins,
such as programmed cell death-1 ligand (PDL-1; ref. 3).

antibody targeting nectin-4 and the potent microtubule-disrupting agent monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE). Our ﬁndings demonstrate that the ADC speciﬁcally binds human, as well as rat and
monkey nectin-4, inhibits in vitro growth of cell lines that express
cell surface nectin-4, and inhibits growth of several target-expressing xenograft tumors, including patient-derived xenografts. Both
versions of enfortumab vedotin, hybridoma AGS-22M6E (also
known as ASG-22ME) and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) ASG22CE, show eradication of established tumor xenografts. Our
preclinical data suggest that anti-nectin-4 ADC has great potential
as a therapeutic agent for multiple cancer indications in the
clinical setting.

and rehydration, tissue sections were treated for antigen retrieval
with EDTA for 30 minutes and incubated with the primary
antibody M22-244b3 or isotype control antibody mouse IgG1k
for 1 hour. Expression was then detected with the BioGenex Super
Sensitive Polymer-HRP IHC Detection Kit (BioGenex Laboratories Inc). The intensity and extent of nectin-4 expression was
determined microscopically using the histochemical scoring
system (H-score), deﬁned as the sum of the products of the
staining intensity (score of 0–3) multiplied by the percentage of
cells (0–100) stained at a given intensity. Specimens were then
classiﬁed as negative (H-score 0–14), weak (H-score 15–99),
moderate (H-score 100–199), and strong (H-score 200–300).

Materials and Methods

Flow cytometry
Adherent cell monolayers were detached by treatment with 0.5
mmol/L EDTA in PBS, washed, and incubated with anti-nectin-4
antibodies for 1 hour at 4 C. The cells were then washed and
stained with phycoerythrin-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG
(Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories Inc.) and analyzed by
ﬂow cytometry.

Cell lines and xenografts
Human cancer cell lines T-47D (breast cancer) and NCIH322M (small-cell bronchoalveolar carcinoma) were obtained
from the NCI (2004; Frederick, MD). PC-3 (prostate cancer) was
purchased from the ATCC (2008) and cultured in RPMI1640
media (Life Technologies) supplemented with 10% FBS (Omega
Scientiﬁc) and 1% glutamine (Life Technologies). Rat1(E) ﬁbroblast cell line of rat origin, a gift from Dr. Robert Eisenman (2002;
Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA), was
cultured in DMEM (Life Technologies) supplemented with
10% FBS and 1% glutamine (13). Cell lines were passaged in
our laboratory for fewer than 6 months after their resuscitation.
Human cell lines were conﬁrmed utilizing short tandem repeat
proﬁling (Promega). AG-B1, AG-Br7, and AG-Panc4 are Agensys'
proprietary, patient-derived tumor xenografts of bladder, breast,
and pancreatic cancers, respectively. Tumors were propagated by
serial passaging in SCID mice. Nectin-4 expression in the xenografts was routinely monitored by qPCR and IHC.
Expression vectors, cloning, and puriﬁcation of recombinant
proteins
Human, cynomolgus monkey, and rat nectin-4 cDNAs were
cloned into the retroviral vector pSRa, a gift from Dr. Owen Witte
(University of California, Los Angeles, CA), or pBabe-puro (Cell
Biolabs, Inc.), using conventional recombinant DNA techniques.
Viral particles for transduction were generated by cotransfection
of the recombinant retroviral vectors with helper plasmid encoding gag/pol/env proteins into 293FT cells (Life Technologies). A
cDNA encoding amino acids 1–357 of the extracellular domain
(ECD) of human nectin-4 was cloned into the pET vector for
expression in Escherichia coli. The complete ECDs of nectin-4 and
nectin-1 were cloned into mammalian expression vectors with
either a myc-his tag or an IgG1 Fc fusion for expression in 293FT
mammalian cells. Recombinant proteins were puriﬁed using
afﬁnity chromatography either on Ni-NTA or protein A/G agarose.

Antibody and ADC generation
The fully human mAb AGS-22M6 targeting the ECD of human
nectin-4 was generated using the Xenomouse platform developed
by Amgen (formerly Abgenix; ref. 14). Brieﬂy, human IgG1
antibody–producing Xenomice were immunized with the puriﬁed ECD of human nectin-4. B cells from lymph nodes and
spleens were fused with the SP2/0 myeloma fusion partner.
Hybridoma screening to identify antibodies speciﬁc for nectin4 was performed using ELISA and FACS assays. For the recombinant expression of AGS-22M6 antibody in mammalian cells, the
AGS-22M6 variable heavy chain and k light chains were
sequenced from the corresponding hybridoma and cloned into
the pEE12.4 expression vector (Lonza), and the resulting plasmid
was transfected into CHO host cells (CHOK1SV, Lonza). Transfected cells were subjected to selection in the absence of glutamine
to generate a stable antibody–producing cell line. The CHOK1SVderived antibody is referred to as ASG-22C. ADCs referred to as
AGS-22M6E (also known as ASG-22ME) and ASG-22CE were
generated via conjugation of hybridoma-produced AGS-22M6
and CHO-derived ASG-22C antibodies, respectively, to the smallmolecule microtubule-disrupting agent MMAE via the cleavable
drug linker maleimidocaproylvaline-citrulline-p-aminobenzyloxycarbonyl using technology licensed from Seattle Genetics,
Inc. as previously published (15). The antibodies AGS-22M6 and
ASG-22C, as well as isotype control antibody, were conjugated to
MMAE following partial reduction of interchain disulﬁde bonds
with tris (2-carboxyethyl)-phosphine as described previously
(16). The drug-to-antibody ratio was approximately 4:1.

IHC
A mAb (M22-244b3) against the ECD of E. coli–derived recombinant human nectin-4 was generated using standard mouse
hybridoma technology. The antibody was validated for nectin4 speciﬁcity by correlating staining patterns on formalin-ﬁxed,
parafﬁn-embedded (FFPE) sections of various cell lines, xenografted tissues, and patient samples with available RNA data. The
speciﬁcity of the antibody was also conﬁrmed by Western blot
analysis. Tissue microarrays (TMA) were obtained from US Biomax and TriStar Technology Group LLC. After deparafﬁnization

Cytotoxicity assay
PC-3 cells engineered to express nectin-4 of human, monkey, or
rat origin or T-47D breast carcinoma cells were incubated with
serially diluted AGS-22M6E or isotype control ADC at 37 C in 5%
CO2. Cell viability was measured after 5 days using AlamarBlue
(Life Technologies). Percent survival was calculated as the number
of live cells in treated wells divided by the number of live cells in
control wells. The IC50 was derived from the survival curve using
the sigmoid Emax nonlinear regression analysis function in
GraphPad Prism (GraphPad).

ADC Cancer Therapeutic Targeting Nectin-4

In vivo studies
All experimental protocols were approved by Agensys' Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. The bladder cancer
AG-B1 xenograft model was established at Agensys by serially
passaging a patient specimen of bladder cancer in SCID mice.
The AG-Br7 xenograft model was derived from a specimen of a
patient with triple-negative breast cancer. AG-Panc4 was established from a patient with moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma of the pancreas (17). NCI-H322M lung adenocarcinoma cell line was used as a lung cancer model. Five- to 6-weekold ICR-SCID mice were obtained from Taconic BioSciences.
For experiments with subcutaneous models of AG-B1, AG-Br7,
and AG-Panc4, xenograft tumor fragments (5–6 pieces, 1 mm3
each) were implanted subcutaneously into the ﬂank of each
mouse. For experiments using the orthotopic breast tumor
model AG-Br7, tumor pieces were enzymatically digested to
single-cell suspension using Liberase Blendzyme (Roche
Applied Science), and 3  106 cells were injected into the
mammary fat pad of individual female SCID mice. For experiments with NCI-H322M lung adenocarcinoma–derived xenografts, mice were injected with 2.5  106 tumor cells subcutaneously into the ﬂank of the mice. Number of mice used for
each experiment is indicated in Fig. 6. Treatment by intravenous administration was initiated when tumors reached
approximately 200 mm3 in size. Tumor length (L) and width
(W) were measured with a caliper, and tumor volume was
calculated using the formula W2  L/2. Percent tumor regression was calculated as the tumor volume in a mouse treated
with AGS-22M6E relative to the tumor volume in mice treated
with control ADC or vehicle control. Percent tumor regression
at the end of the study was calculated as the tumor volume in
each mouse one day before sacriﬁce relative to the tumor

volume in the same mouse on day 1 of the study. A statistical
analysis of the tumor volumes at the start of treatment and one
day before animal sacriﬁce was performed using the nonparametric Kruskal–Wallis test. Pairwise comparisons were made
using the Tukey–Kramer method (two sided) on the ranks of
the data to protect experiment-wise error rate.

Results
Nectin-4 expression in normal tissues and tumor specimens
In a series of discovery experiments using suppression subtractive hybridization as described previously (18), we identiﬁed nectin-4 (also known as PVRL4) as a gene markedly
upregulated in bladder cancer. Nectin-4 is a type I transmembrane polypeptide member of the nectin family of adhesion
molecules and was ﬁrst identiﬁed through a bioinformatics
search by Reymond and colleagues (19). We generated a mouse
antibody, referred to as M22-244b3, directed against the ECD
of human nectin-4 expressed in E. coli. M22-244b3 is speciﬁc
for nectin-4 and does not crossreact with other nectin family
members (data not shown). Immunohistochemical analysis
using M22-244b3 of a panel of 294 normal tissue specimens
representing 36 human organs showed homogenous weak to
moderate staining mainly in human skin keratinocytes, skin
appendages (sweat glands and hair follicles), transitional epithelium of bladder, salivary gland (ducts), esophagus, breast,
and stomach. Representative specimens are shown in Fig. 1.
Weak staining was detected in samples of larynx, pituitary,
placenta, testis, ureter, and uterus.
Next, we conducted an extensive immunohistochemical analysis of nectin-4 expression in a total of 2,394 cases of human cancers from 34 tumor TMAs representing 7 different

staining for nectin-4 in FFPE human
tissue sections is indicated by browncolor precipitate in skin (A); salivary

in ovary (E) and spleen (F).

indications—bladder, lung, breast, pancreatic, ovarian, head/
neck, and esophageal cancers. As shown in Table 1, across all
evaluated cancer indications, 69% of TMA cancer specimens were
positive for nectin-4. Highest frequencies for overall expression of
nectin-4 were observed for bladder, breast, and pancreatic tumors.
Moderate or strong staining (indicated by H-score) was most
frequently observed in bladder and breast specimens: 60% of
bladder and 53% of breast cancer specimens showed either strong
or moderate staining, with approximately equal percentages
within each tumor type. In ovarian, head/neck, and esophageal
tumor specimens, the prevalence of nectin-4–positive specimens
with moderate or strong staining was generally lower and significantly more pronounced in the mucinous type. Strong expression
was detected in both lung adenocarcinoma and squamous cell
carcinoma (SCC; 5% and 10%, respectively). Representative
images of moderate and strong immunohistochemical staining
across tumor specimens are shown in Fig. 2. Notably, speciﬁc
immunoreactivity for nectin-4 was localized predominantly on
cell membrane or cell membrane and cytoplasm of tumor cells.
Metastatic tissue specimens (typically lymph nodes of bladder,
breast, lung, and ovarian cancers) included in some TMAs showed
similar H-score of nectin-4 expression as observed for the primary
tumors. Nectin-4 was detected in 60% of lung cancer metastasis
(22/31 adenocarcinoma, 24/34 SCC, and 0/12 small-cell carcinoma). In ovarian cancer, nectin-4 was detected in 77% of patient
metastasis specimens (30/38 serous adenocarcinoma, 1/1 mucinous adenocarcinoma, and 0/1 transitional carcinoma).
Antibody and ADC characterization
A fully human mAb, AGS-22M6, was generated by immunizing
human IgG1–producing strain of XenoMouse with the human
nectin-4 ECD. AGS-22M6 was selected among a panel of >50
distinct anti-nectin-4 mAb produced in the XenoMouse. This
antibody binds to transfected human, monkey, or rat nectin-4

3006 Cancer Res; 76(10) May 15, 2016

expressed on the cell surface of PC-3 cells (Fig. 3A) and endogenous nectin-4 expressed on the surface of NCI-H322M and T47D cells (Fig. 3B). The PC-3 cell line was selected for transfection
as it does not express endogenous nectin-4. The apparent afﬁnitybinding constant (KD) value for nectin-4 expressed on T-47D
breast cancer cells was 0.01 nmol/L (Fig. 3C). We also found a
similar KD for AGS-22M6E, the ADC produced by conjugation to
vcMMAE (Fig. 3C). Thus, the conjugation process did not alter
binding characteristics of parental antibody AGS-22M6 to nectin4 on the surface of cancer cell lines.
To further characterize AGS-22M6, we constructed deletion
mutants consisting of the membrane-distant (V) or membraneproximal (C0 C00 ) domains of nectin-4 fused to its transmembrane
and intracellular domains. We expressed the domain-deleted
proteins on the surface of Rat1(E) ﬁbroblasts and conducted
binding experiments with AGS-22M6 or another anti-nectin-4
antibody, AGS-22M104, which had been found to bind nectin-4
within its C0 C00 and not the V region. Notably, AGS-22M6 recognized an epitope located in the V-domain with the same apparent
afﬁnity as to the full-length nectin-4 expressed in the same host
cells (Fig. 4A). AGS-22M6 did not bind to the C0 C00 domain. Proof
that lack of binding of AGS-22M6 was not due to lack of expression of the C0 C00 domain mutant was demonstrated by the ability
of AGS-22M104 to exhibit binding in the assay.
The V-domains of nectin molecules were previously demonstrated to mediate homo- and heterodimerization of nectins in cisand trans- conﬁgurations, and nectin-4 was shown to interact with
nectin-1 with nanomolar afﬁnity (20). Therefore, we evaluated
the ability of AGS-22M6 to block the interaction of nectin-1 with
nectin-4 expressed on the surface of Rat1(E) ﬁbroblasts. As shown
in Fig. 4B, a biotinylated ECD of nectin-1 expressed as an Fc fusion
protein was able to bind to cell surface nectin-4, and this interaction was effectively disrupted by the addition of either AGS22M6 or the AGS-22M6E ADC.

In vitro cytotoxicity
The ability of the AGS-22M6E ADC to inhibit cell survival was
evaluated in the PC-3 cell lines engineered to express human,
monkey, or rat nectin-4, as well as in the T-47D human breast
carcinoma cells that endogenously express nectin-4. Serial dilutions of AGS-22M6, AGS-22M6E ADC, and an isotype control
ADC were added to cells, and cell viability was measured after 5
days. As shown in Fig. 5, AGS-22M6E ADC, but not unconjugated
AGS-22M6 or control ADC, induced dose-dependent inhibition
of cell viability both in T-47D cells and in PC-3 cells transfected
with human, monkey, or rat nectin-4. AGS-22M6E ADC had no
effect on mock-transfected PC-3 cell controls. We did not observe
any signiﬁcant cytotoxic activity using an isotype control ADC on
the various PC-3 cell lines.

In vivo efﬁcacy
To evaluate the therapeutic potential of AGS-22M6E ADC,
we performed a set of in vivo efﬁcacy studies in murine models
of xenografted human cancers. Both cell line–derived and
proprietary patient tumor–derived xenografts were selected on
the basis of the expression of human nectin-4. A total of 13
xenograft models were evaluated across 4 cancer indications
(bladder, breast, pancreas, and lung). Tumor size ranged from
100 to 200 mm3 at the start of the treatment in all models, and
ADC was administered in all studies by intravenous injection.
Overall, AGS-22M6E ADC induced tumor regression in 5 of the
13 models and resulted in signiﬁcant inhibition of established
tumor growth in 12 of 13 models examined. Representative
studies using an AG-B1 bladder cancer model, two AG-Br7

of which express endogenous nectin-4
on the cell surface, were subjected to
immunocytological staining with AGS22M6 and analyzed by ﬂow cytometry. A,

breast cancer models, and an AG-Panc4 pancreatic cancer
model are described below. Nectin-4 expression in these xenograft tumors is shown in Fig. 6A. In all these in vivo antitumor
efﬁcacy studies, the ADCs were well tolerated. No reduction in
body weight or signs of distress was observed in any of the
treatment groups (data not shown).
Treatment of AG-B1 xenograft tumors with single 4 mg/kg
doses of AGS-22M6E or two other anti-nectin-4 ADCs caused
regression of established tumors (Fig. 6B). Immunohistochemical
evaluation of the tumor site at the end of the study showed
complete tumor eradication in 5 of the 6 mice treated with
AGS-22M6E. Depending on the treatment regimen, AGS22M6E was able to eradicate or signiﬁcantly inhibit tumor growth
in this bladder cancer model. As shown in Fig. 6C, AGS-22M6E at
0.8 mg/kg dosed every 4 days for a total of 5 doses signiﬁcantly
inhibited growth of established AG-B1 tumor xenografts when
compared with control ADC at 0.8 mg/kg (P < 0.0001), whereas
AGS-22M6E given at the lower dose of 0.4 mg/kg did not show
signiﬁcant antitumor activity when compared with any of the
controls (P > 0.05). IHC analysis of xenografts from treated
animals showed strong AGS-22M6E ADC localization to the
xenograft tumors within 6 hours of treatment, whereas the control

3008 Cancer Res; 76(10) May 15, 2016

ADC is trapped in the stroma (Supplementary Fig. S1). Localization of ADC peaks at 24 hours and starts diffusing at 72 hours
(Supplementary Fig. S1).
We next evaluated potency of AGS-22M6E against breast cancer
using the AG-Br7 subcutaneous xenograft model. As shown in Fig.
6D, AGS-22M6E at 3 mg/kg had a potent tumor inhibitory effect
when compared with the control ADC, the unconjugated antibody AGS-22M6 or the vehicle control: 91.3% inhibition versus
control ADC (P < 0.0001); 94.2% inhibition versus AGS22M6
(P < 0.0001); and 93.9% inhibition versus vehicle (P < 0.0001). In
addition, treatment with 3 mg/kg AGS-22M6E resulted in regression of the tumor by 62.9% at the end of the study relative to the
starting tumor size (P < 0.0001). AGS-22M6E given at the lower
dose of 1 mg/kg also showed signiﬁcant effect when compared
with either control ADC at the equivalent dose (P ¼ 0.0371) or
vehicle control (P ¼ 0.0003), resulting in 44.5% and 34.6% tumor
inhibition, respectively. A statistically signiﬁcant difference (P ¼
0.0147) was detected when the two doses of AGS-22M6E were
compared, indicating a dose-dependent effect of AGS-22M6E. The
efﬁcacy of AGS-22M6E was also examined against an orthotopic
xenograft, in which AG-Br7 tumors were established in mammary
fat pads of SCID mice. As shown in Fig. 6E, AGS-22M6E

administered either as a single 10 mg/kg dose or as two 5 mg/kg
doses resulted in complete eradication of established tumors.
Lower doses were not explored in this model.
In the AG-Panc4 model, AGS-22M6E at 3 mg/kg led to tumor
stasis, with signiﬁcant tumor growth inhibition compared with
isotype control ADC at equivalent dosage (Fig. 6F). In the NCIH322M lung adenocarcinoma xenograft model, AGS-22M6E at 3
mg/kg resulted in 83.6% tumor regression compared with isotype
control ADC at the same dose (P < 0.0001, Fig. 6G). In addition,
treatment with AGS-22M6E at 3 mg/kg resulted in 20.5% tumor
regression (P ¼ 0.03461). AGS-22M6E given at a lower dose of 1.0
mg/kg did not show a signiﬁcant effect when compared with
control ADC at the equivalent dose (P ¼ 0.1455).
In support of the clinical development of an ADC targeting
nectin-4, the AGS-22M6 antibody produced in the hybridoma
system was converted into a human recombinant product
expressed in CHO cells as detailed in Materials and Methods. A
comparability analysis between the hybridoma-derived AGS22M6E ADC and the CHO-derived ASG-22CE ADC was performed in vitro and in vivo. Both ADCs showed identical in vitro
characteristics: binding constants for nectin-4 were 0.057 and
0.060 nmol/L for AGS-22M6E and ASG-22CE, respectively, and
IC50 of 1.523 and 1.674 nmol/L, respectively. When injected in
mice, both AGS-22M6E and ASG-22CE showed comparable
pharmacokinetic proﬁle up to 10 days (Supplementary Fig.
S2; Table 1). ADC and total IgG exhibited similar exposure and
serum elimination half-life ranging from 1.5 to 2 days. They also
exhibited equivalent dose-dependent tumor growth inhibition in
the breast cancer AG-Br7 xenograft model (Fig. 6H).

Discussion
Nectin-4 was originally cloned from human trachea and
described as an antigen with a restricted pattern of expression

3010 Cancer Res; 76(10) May 15, 2016

in normal tissues (19). More recently, nectin-4 was identiﬁed as
an entry point for measles and other viruses and was proposed
as a target for oncolytic viral therapy (21, 22). Although several
groups reported the detection of nectin-4 expression in breast,
ovarian, and lung cancers (23–26), no comprehensive analysis
has been reported to date. Using suppression subtractive hybridization, we identiﬁed nectin-4 as one of the genes dramatically
upregulated in bladder cancer specimens. Our RNA expression
analysis of a larger cancer sample panel and of normal tissues
also indicated that nectin-4 transcript is present at low levels in
various normal tissues and is upregulated in a subset of breast,
pancreatic, and lung cancer specimens (Agensys, unpublished
data). In this report, we used IHC to demonstrate nectin-4
protein expression in normal tissue specimens and in TMAs
from various types of cancer. Our results showed broader
expression in normal tissues than was previously reported.
Nectin-4 expression was detected in the epithelia of bladder,
breast, stomach, esophagus, salivary gland (ducts), and skin
(epidermis and sweat glands). Epithelial components of other
organs showed weaker and less consistent staining for nectin-4.
Investigation of normal tissue antigen expression is essential for
the clinical progression of an ADC. Prohibitive on-target toxicities have been observed for several ADCs, such as skin toxicities (27). The extensive expression proﬁling of nectin-4
described herein allowed us to identify normal tissues that may
raise the potential risk of eliciting nectin-4 on-target toxicities.
These have been investigated in two cross-reactive species (rat
and cynomolgus monkey), as well as in the clinical setting.
Preliminarily, the ﬁndings suggest a favorable therapeutic window, but details will be reported as part of a complete analysis
of phase I results.
In cancer patient specimens, >50% samples tested positive
for nectin-4 protein expression, and the level of expression,
based on IHC staining intensity, was highest in bladder cancer

and breast cancer. In general, good correlation between protein
expression based on IHC and previously observed transcript
levels was observed. Overall, IHC analyses demonstrated moderate to strong expression (H-score > 100) of nectin-4 in 60% of
bladder cancer and 53% of breast cancer specimens. In addition, 37% and 27% of pancreatic and lung cancer specimens,
respectively, demonstrated moderate to strong expression. Generally, we observed similar overall frequency of nectin-4 expression in ovarian cancer as previously published by Derycke and
colleagues (26).
Soluble form of Nectin-4 in patient serum and in ascites in
case of ovarian cancer has been reported (24–26). Although
the levels varied between reports, all investigators show an
association between higher detected levels of soluble nectin-4
and disease progression. Many other membrane-anchored
proteins release their ECD through proteolytic cleavage, such
as HER2 and EGFR (28, 29). However, clinical signiﬁcance of
such form has been difﬁcult to establish, and effect on
response to targeted therapy has not been fully elucidated
(30–32).
AGS-22M6, a fully human antibody targeting nectin-4, was
selected from a panel of >50 antibodies for further evaluation
as a drug conjugate based on its high afﬁnity, broad species
cross-reactivity, and ability to mediate very potent cell death
both in vitro and in vivo. The ADC AGS-22M6E, composed of
AGS-22M6E conjugated to MMAE, exhibited dose-dependent
antitumor activity in vivo. At lower doses (1 mg/kg), the ADC
inhibited growth of bladder and breast cancer xenografts. At
higher doses (3 mg/kg), AGS-22M6E induced tumor regression of the subcutaneous bladder cancer xenograft, the subcutaneous breast cancer xenograft, and the orthotopic breast
cancer xenograft. In addition, AGS-22M6E inhibited the
growth of both the pancreatic cancer xenograft and the lung
adenocarcinoma xenograft, with associated modest tumor
regression in the lung tumor model. The in vivo efﬁcacy of
AGS-22M6E generally correlated well with the expression level
of nectin-4 in xenografts and cell lines. In most of the studies
described herein, the parental unconjugated antibody AGS22M6 was included as a control for efﬁcacy. We concluded that
binding of unconjugated antibody to nectin-4 does not result
in antitumor activity in either in vitro or in vivo preclinical
models.
Our data also demonstrated that under the conditions of an
in vitro binding assay, AGS-22M6 and AGS-22M6E blocked the
interaction of nectin-4 with nectin-1, its putative binding
partner. The functional signiﬁcance of this observation is presently unknown, as the role of nectin-4 in normal epithelial
tissue structure and morphogenesis is poorly understood. We
and others hypothesize that nectin-4 plays a role in the establishment and maintenance of adherens junctions, which in
normal epithelium deﬁne cell polarity, a characteristic often
lost during cancer progression (12). We have attempted, but
not yet succeeded, in identifying an anti-nectin-4 antibody that
intrinsically modulates tumor growth. In a recent publication,
Pavlova and colleagues (33) demonstrated that nectin-4 promotes anchorage-independent growth in breast cancer cells by
activation of the matrix-independent integrin b4/SHP-2/c-Src
and that the transformation of breast cancer cells to anchorage
independence is dependent on nectin-4. The authors also
reported modest inhibition of growth of a breast cancer xenograft by a mAb targeted against human nectin-4. The mecha-

3012 Cancer Res; 76(10) May 15, 2016

nism of action of such antibody will need to be further
investigated.
On the basis of its ability to induce tumor regression in
human breast and bladder cancer specimens, as well its favorable toxicology proﬁle in various species (Agensys, unpublished data), AGS-22M6E, the hybridoma-derived ADC, was
investigated in early-phase clinical studies for safety and pharmacokinetics in patients with solid tumors that express nectin-4
(ClinicalTrials.gov identiﬁer NCT01409135). Because pivotal
registration trials will require an antibody produced at high
titers using mammalian cells, we have subsequently developed
a comparable CHO-derived anti-nectin-4 antibody, ASG-22CE.
Our preclinical studies with ASG-22CE ADC showed that it has
equivalent binding and potency as the hybridoma product.
ASG-22CE entered the clinic in 2014 as monotherapy in
patients with metastatic urothelial cancer, as well as other solid
tumors that express nectin-4 (ClinicalTrials.gov identiﬁer
NCT02091999), and is currently under clinical development
as enfortumab vedotin.
Overall, the data presented herein indicate that nectin-4 is a
viable target for ADC therapy in carcinomas expressing nectin-4
and support the evaluation of such ADCs in the clinical setting.
The preclinical data demonstrate growth inhibition across
multiple human xenograft tumor models and tumor regression
in bladder and breast cancer models. Our ﬁnding of nectin-4
overexpression in human tumor specimens, particularly those
from patients with breast, bladder, pancreatic, or lung cancer,
suggests that a signiﬁcant proportion of patients may beneﬁt
from nectin-4 targeted delivery of a potent cytotoxic agent to
the tumor site.

Disclosure of Potential Conﬂicts of Interest
Enfortumab Vedotin is being codeveloped in conjunction with Agensys'
partner, Seattle Genetics, Inc. No potential conﬂicts of interest were
