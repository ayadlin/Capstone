BACKGROUND: Angiogenesis contributes to the progression of urothelial carcinoma (UC). In the current study, the authors investigated the role of maintenance sunitinib in patients with advanced UC. METHODS: Patients with locally recurrent/metastatic UC and
adequate organ function who achieved stable disease or a partial or complete response after 4 to 6 chemotherapy cycles were
randomized to sunitinib at a dose of 50 mg/day (28 days on and 14 days off) or placebo. The primary endpoint was the 6-month progression rate. Secondary endpoints were safety, survival, change in serum vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)/soluble VEGF
receptor-2 (sVEGFR2), and the activity of sunitinib in patients who developed disease progression while receiving placebo. A total of
38 eligible patients per treatment arm were required to select better therapy with 90% probability (a 5 .05). RESULTS: A total of 54
eligible patients were randomized to either the sunitinib arm (26 patients) or the placebo arm (28 patients). The median number of
cycles received was 2 cycles per treatment arm. The most common grade 3 to 4 adverse events (graded according to version 3.0 of
the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events) among patients receiving sunitinib were thrombocytopenia, diarrhea, mucositis, fatigue, and hypertension. There were no grade 3 or 4 adverse events noted among > 5% of patients
receiving placebo. The 6-month progression rate was 72% versus 64%. The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 2.9 months
(range, 0.5 months-32.5 months) versus 2.7 months (range, 0.8 months 265 months) for the sunitinib versus placebo arms, respectively. Patients receiving placebo were found to have no changes in their serum VEGF/sVEGFR2 levels over time. Patients treated
with sunitinib had no significant change in their VEGF level, but the sVEGFR2 level significantly decreased after cycles 1 and 2
(P <.0001) and at the time of disease progression (P 5.0002). A baseline VEGF level that was at or greater than the median was
found to be correlated with a longer PFS. Sixteen patients who were receiving placebo received sunitinib at the time of disease progression, with the best responses being 1 partial response (6.3%), 6 cases of stable disease (37.5%), and 5 cases of progressive disease (31.3%); 4 patients were not evaluable for response. The median PFS was 3.7 months (range, 0.1 months-22 months).
CONCLUSIONS: The current multicenter study was limited by premature closure and a small sample size. Maintenance sunitinib did
not appear to improve the 6-month progression rate. Open-label sunitinib was found to have only modest activity. The sVEGFR2 level

INTRODUCTION
Metastatic urothelial cancer (UC) is lethal, with 15,210 estimated deaths expected in the United States in 2013.1
Cisplatin-based chemotherapy continues to be the standard first-line treatment, resulting in a median progression-free
survival (PFS) of 7 months to 8 months and a median survival of 14 months to 15 months.2,3 Considering that chemotherapy cannot be given in the long term and that disease progression invariably occurs after discontinuing chemotherapy,

even in responding patients, strategies that can help to
prolong the chemotherapy-induced disease response are
critical to the management of this malignancy.
Angiogenesis appears to play a major role in the
growth and metastasis of UC.4 Microvascular density, a
measure of tumor angiogenesis, has been correlated with a
higher incidence of metastasis and worse prognosis in
patients with UC.5 Of the angiogenic factors, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has been identified as a
crucial regulator of both normal and pathologic angiogenesis. Increased VEGF expression has been reported in
patients with UC and has been correlated with a higher
stage/grade of disease, disease progression, and poor prognosis.6-8 Preclinical data have supported the role of therapeutic targeting of VEGF in patients with UC; however,
clinical data have shown only modest activity, especially
when VEGF inhibitors are used as single agents.9-11
Sunitinib (SU11248) is an oral inhibitor of multiple
receptor tyrosine kinases, including VEGF receptors
(VEGFRs), platelet-derived growth factor receptors, stem
cell factor receptor (KIT), colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor, RET, and Flt-3. It is approved by the US Food
and Drug Administration for the treatment of several
solid tumors.12-17 Sunitinib has antitumor activity in
human bladder cancer models both in vitro and in
vivo.18,19 Based on the critical role of angiogenesis in disease progression and the preclinical activity of sunitinib in
bladder cancer models, we hypothesized that VEGF
pathway-directed therapy would maintain disease
response and would therefore decrease the progression
rate in patients with advanced UC who had achieved at
least stable disease (SD) after chemotherapy.

within 4 weeks of starting study treatment, had active
central nervous system disease, were pregnant or breastfeeding, were positive for the human immunodeficiency
virus, had an unresolved bacterial infection, or experienced a serious medical condition within 6 months
before study treatment that would impact on patient
safety. All patients signed Institutional Review Boardapproved consent forms and were registered with the
University of Michigan Cancer Center Clinical Trials
Office before the initiation of therapy.
Patient Evaluation

Baseline evaluation included a complete history and physical examination, complete blood count, comprehensive
metabolic panel, thyroid-stimulating hormone, a pregnancy test in women of childbearing age, electrocardiogram, multigated acquisition scan, and chest/abdomen/
bone imaging.
Adverse events (AEs) were graded according to version 3.0 of the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events. Disease status was assessed
at baseline and then every 12 weeks (6 1 week) regardless
of dose delays until disease progression. Response was
assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
(RECIST; version 1.0) and was confirmed by repeat
assessment at least once at a minimum interval of 12
weeks. Response duration was measured from the time of
objective response until the first date of disease recurrence
or progression (based on the smallest measurements
recorded since treatment started).
The current study is available at ClinicalTrials.gov
(NCT00393796).

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Treatment Plan

Key Eligibility Criteria

Patients were stratified by prior response to first-line
chemotherapy (SD vs PR vs CR) and randomized to
receive either sunitinib or placebo (1:1). The blinded
study drug (sunitinib at a dose of 50 mg or placebo) was
administered orally daily for 4 consecutive weeks, followed by a 2-week rest period (1 cycle). In the absence of
disease progression or toxicity, patients were required to
remain on the study for at least 12 weeks (2 cycles) to be
regarded as having an adequate therapeutic trial. The
study drug dose was reduced to 37.5 mg (21 dose level)
and 25 mg (22 dose level) according to prespecified criteria. In the event of any drug-related (grade 2) nonurgent
ventricular paroxysmal dysrhythmia requiring intervention or grade 3 to 4 nonhematologic or grade 4 hematologic AEs, the drug was held until resolution to less than

Eligible patients had a pathologic diagnosis of UC (pure

or a partial (PR) or complete (CR) response after 4 to 6
cycles of standard first-line chemotherapy for locally
recurrent or metastatic UC. Prior adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy was allowed, but no prior antiangiogenic agents were permitted for the current disease stage.
Patients were registered within 42 days after their last
chemotherapy dose and were excluded if they had undergone any major surgery or experienced a  grade 3 hemorrhage (according to version 3.0 of the National Cancer

or equal to grade 1 and the drug was restarted at a 21
dose level. Therapy was continued until evidence of objective or clinical disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. At the time of disease progression, the blind was
broken and patients receiving placebo were offered openlabel sunitinib if they were otherwise eligible, whereas
those patients whose disease progressed during treatment
with sunitinib were removed from the study.
Correlative Studies

Circulating VEGF and soluble VEGFR2 (sVEGFR2)
were evaluated as potential predictors of outcome based
on data from patients with renal cell carcinoma (RCC)
who were treated with sunitinib that suggested a correlation between changes in circulating marker levels and
response to sunitinib.20 We hypothesized that patients
with advanced UC would have increased serum VEGF
and decreased sVEGFR2 levels in response to sunitinib
and that patients with an objective response would demonstrate larger proportional changes. Serum was collected
at baseline and at the end of each cycle (for the first 3
cycles) to measure the VEGF and sVEGFR2 levels, in
both the blinded and open-label study phases. Blood was
collected in serum separator tubes and was immediately
centrifuged at a cold temperature for 10 to 12 minutes or
until the serum separated from the cell pellet. If immediate centrifugation was not feasible, the blood sample was
spun and stored at 4 C for up to 6 hours. Serum VEGF
and sVEGFR2 were measured by an enzyme-linked
immunoadsorbent assay (R&D Systems, Minneapolis,
Minn), according to the manufacturerâ€™s instructions.
Statistical Analysis

The primary endpoint was to compare the 6-month disease progression rate between patients randomized to
receive either sunitinib or placebo. Based on published
data with first-line chemotherapy,2,3 it was estimated that
patients would have a median time to disease progression
(TTP) of 4 months from the end of their last treatment
cycle; it was hypothesized that sunitinib would increase
this by 50% to 6 months. Assuming exponential survival
rates, these median TTP values can be converted into 6month progression rates of approximately 65% and 50%,
respectively. Using these rates in the randomized selection
design,21 a total of 38 subjects per treatment arm would
allow for the selection of the superior treatment arm with
a 90% probability (a 5 .05). To account for patient dropouts before reaching the 6-month progression assessment,
4 additional subjects would be accrued to each arm, with
an accrual goal of 42 subjects per treatment arm.
694

The 6-month progression rate was reported by treatment arm using product-limit estimates from the KaplanMeier method and the associated 95% confidence
intervals (95% CIs). Progression events in this intent-totreat analysis included documented disease progression or
death, whichever occurred first. Patients who were lost to
follow-up for disease progression were censored at the
time of their last assessment for disease progression. The
protocol was written with TTP as the secondary endpoint
of the analysis. However, an early death while receiving
treatment indicated PFS to be the more appropriate endpoint to report in this randomized trial to avoid introducing bias in the sunitinib arm inappropriately. A subset
analysis was completed to determine whether an effect
between treatments was found among patients who
adhered to the treatment plan. This analysis censored 3
patients on the placebo arm at the date they were inadvertently given sunitinib. Secondary endpoints reported
included the objective response rate in patients with SD
after chemotherapy, median PFS, and median overall survival (OS). OS was assessed using product-limit estimates
from the Kaplan-Meier method.
Changes in serum VEGF and sVEGFR2 levels after
cycle 1 (days 27-35) and cycle 2 (days 69-84) were compared with baseline within each treatment arm using a
Student t test for paired data. Kaplan-Meier methods
were used to assess the association between baseline
VEGF and sVEGFR2 levels and PFS and OS and changes
from baseline at cycle 1 for each measure. Cox models
were used to investigate biomarker association with PFS
and OS controlling for the clinical and demographic covariates. The objective response rate, median PFS, median
OS, and progression rates with 95% CIs for patients
receiving open-label sunitinib were reported.

Summary

The study closed early due to slow accrual, with 54 eligible
patients from 9 institutions enrolled between November
2006 and January 2011. The median age of the patients
was 69 years, the median ECOG PS was 1, and 70% of
patients had a primary tumor of the bladder. At the time
of study entry, 28 patients had SD, 22 patients had
achieved a PR, and 4 had achieved a CR after chemotherapy. Twenty-six patients were randomized to treatment
with sunitinib and 28 were randomized to receive placebo
(Table 1) (Fig. 1). Three patients randomized to receive
placebo inadvertently received sunitinib during their
treatment course (2 patients for 4 weeks and 1 patient for

until the time of disease progression or death, whichever
occurred first (intent-to-treat analysis). Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics, including response to
prior chemotherapy, were relatively well balanced. The
median number of cycles (sunitinib or placebo) was 2 per
treatment arm (range, 1 cycle-25 cycles). The median duration of therapy in the open-label sunitinib arm was 9.5
weeks (range, 0.3 weeks-96 weeks).
Safety and Tolerability

Table 2 summarizes the most frequent (occurring
in > 5% of patients) grade 3 to grade 5 AEs in the blinded
and open phases of the study. The most common grade 3/
4 AEs in patients randomized to treatment with sunitinib
were thrombocytopenia (23.1%/7.7%), diarrhea and
mucositis (15.4%/0%), fatigue (15.4%/3.8%), and
hypertension (11.5%/0%). Seven patients who were
receiving sunitinib came off therapy due to toxicity and
another patient withdrew consent during sunitinib therapy. There were 10 dose delays in 6 patients and 13 dose
reductions; 9 patients had 1 dose reduction and 2 patients
had 2 dose reductions while receiving sunitinib. One
patient who developed liver metastasis while receiving
sunitinib died of nonneutropenic septic shock related to a
urinary tract infection and subsequent liver/renal failure,
which were deemed unlikely to be related to treatment. In

the placebo arm, no high-grade AEs were noted to occur
in > 5% of patients. Of the 16 patients who received
open-label sunitinib, 5 patients discontinued sunitinib
due to AEs (4 of which were related to treatment and 1
that was unrelated).
Efficacy Analysis

With a median follow-up of 10.3 months (range, 1
month-65 months), the 6-month progression rate from
the time of study registration was not different between
patients receiving sunitinib (71.7% [95% CI, 54%87%]) and those receiving placebo (64.3% [95% CI,
47%-81%]). The median PFS was 2.9 months (95% CI,
2.4 months-6.3 months) for sunitinib versus 2.7 months
(95% CI, 2.5 months-7.2 months) for placebo, and the
median OS was 10.5 months for sunitinib (95% CI, 8.1
months-13.8 months) versus 10.3 months for placebo
(95% CI, 6.8 months-18.1 months) (Figs. 2 and 3). Subset analysis including only those patients who received a
minimum of 12 weeks of treatment resulted in similar 6month progression rates. There was no confirmed
response noted among patients with SD after chemotherapy who received sunitinib. Sixteen patients who received
placebo were treated with sunitinib at the time of disease
progression, with a best response of 1 PR (6.3%) that
lasted 15 months (occurring in a female patient with a primary tumor of the bladder and hepatic metastasis who
had achieved a PR after 6 cycles of chemotherapy with carboplatin, paclitaxel, and gemcitabine and developed disease progression on the placebo arm and then received
open-label sunitinib, achieving SD for 8 months followed
by a PR for 15 months), 6 cases of SD (37.5%), and 5
cases of progressive disease (31.25%); 4 patients were not
considered to be evaluable for response. The median PFS
was 3.7 months (range, 0.07 months-22.5 months; 95%
CI, 1.6 months-5.5 months), and the median OS was 5.6
months (range, 0.9 months-31 months; 95% CI, 3.5
months-12.6 months). At the time of last follow-up, 1
patient continued to receive sunitinib (a female patient
with ureteral UC who achieved a CR after 5 cycles of gemcitabine chemotherapy and continued in CR while receiving sunitinib, which she had tolerated well for 33 months
at the time of last follow-up).
VEGF and sVEGFR2

There was no significant change in serum VEGF and
sVEGFR2 levels in patients randomized to receive placebo. Patients treated with sunitinib were found to have
no significant change in their serum VEGF level; however,
the serum sVEGFR2 level significantly decreased after 1

cycle (P < .0001), 2 cycles (P < .0001), and at the time of
disease progression (P 5 .0002) (Fig. 4A and 4B). Baseline serum sVEGFR2 levels did not correlate with PFS or
OS. It is interesting to note that the baseline serum VEGF
was significantly associated with PFS even after controlling for treatment arm, patient age, tumor histology (pure
UC vs mixed), ECOG PS, disease location (bladder vs
other), and response to chemotherapy at the time of study
entry. Patients with a baseline serum VEGF level  350
pg/mL (the median in the current study population) had a
lower hazards ratio of disease progression or death
compared with patients with a baseline VEGF level that
was less than the median (hazards ratio, 0.27; 95% CI,
696

0.12-0.61 [P 5 .001]) (Fig. 5). However, the association
between baseline serum VEGF and PFS did not appear to
differ significantly by treatment arm (P 5 .61). The magnitude of the VEGF and sVEGFR2 level changes at cycle
1 compared with baseline did not correlate with PFS or
OS. In the open-label cohort, the magnitude of change in
the level of sVEGFR2 and the lack of change in VEGF
level were similar to those of the blinded sunitinib cohort
(Fig. 4C). In the open-label cohort, no levels were available at the time of disease progression, and no analysis
regarding a correlation between levels and PFS or OS was
performed due to the low number of patients and
samples.

DISCUSSION
In the current study, we evaluated maintenance sunitinib
to consolidate tumor response to chemotherapy and delay
disease progression. Although this approach is attractive
in principle, its feasibility was compromised by the slow
accrual related to the need for patients to have had at least
SD or a response to prior chemotherapy and suboptimal
tolerability to sunitinib due to adverse events. Sunitinib
did not improve the progression rate at 6 months, had
modest activity at the time of disease progression, and
increased the rate of AEs. Its toxicity profile was notable
and consistent with previous reports.14,15,22,23 In the context of expected treatment-related toxicity, the relative
value of prolonging the median TTP by 2 months may be
questioned; therefore, a favorable benefit-to-risk ratio is
critical in the determination of endpoints for future trials.
There are several potential reasons to account for the
lack of a significant effect with maintenance sunitinib.
Factors include the modest efficacy of sunitinib as a single
agent and the relative importance of the VEGF pathway

The median overall survival for patients treated with sunitinib

at this time point in the disease setting.22,23 Data from
two phase 2 trials of sunitinib in patients with metastatic
UC (with or without prior chemotherapy) indicated modest response rates (range, 3%-8%), and short PFS and OS
(range, 6 months-8 months for median OS).22,23 Similarly, in a phase 2 study, patients with recurrent/refractory
UC received pazopanib at a dose of 800 mg daily with a
17% confirmed objective PR rate (95% CI, 7.2%-32.1%)
and a disease control rate of 51.2%. In that study, 1
patient achieved a PR and was free of disease progression

after 19.2 months of follow-up; however, the median PFS
and OS were very modest (2.6 months and 4.7 months,
respectively).11 Although low single-agent activity makes
an agent suboptimal as the primary therapy, the current
study was designed with the hypothesis that sunitinib
would have better effects, particularly in delaying disease
progression in the setting of a relatively lower tumor burden as an adjunct therapy and not as the main treatment.
The current study did not achieve the predefined
power due to poor accrual and premature closure, which
is unfortunately a recurring theme in UC trials. However,
outcome trends between the treatment arms strongly suggest that sample size was not likely the main reason for the
negative results. Given the importance of prior response
and duration of prior therapy, we stratified patients by
response to prior therapy to ensure relative balance in the
2 arms and limited accrual to patients who had received
698

4 to 6 cycles to minimize variability. However, the median
PFS was shorter than expected in both treatment arms.
This occurred despite the finding that nearly one-half of
the patients had responded (at least partially) to prior
chemotherapy, which is considered a favorable prognostic
factor.24
Although a maintenance strategy is attractive from
the perspective of potentially consolidating the chemotherapy response while minimizing toxicity by preselecting the responders, it may not be optimal strategy when
targeting angiogenesis, and combination therapy may be
better. However, a recent clinical trial of gemcitabine and
cisplatin combined with sunitinib for the treatment of
metastatic as well as earlier-stage muscle-invasive UC
reported that this combination was not feasible due to significant toxicity.25 A phase 2 trial of combination bevacizumab (anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody) and cisplatin/

median PFS was 8.2 months and the median OS was 19.1
months. Because of the higher-than-expected antitumor
effect with chemotherapy and bevacizumab, the Alliance
cooperative oncology group is conducting a phase 3 trial
with this combination (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier
NCT00942331). Another phase 2 trial of the combination of gemcitabine and carboplatin with bevacizumab in
chemotherapy-naive patients with advanced/metastatic
UC who are not candidates for treatment with cisplatin
reported a grade 3/4 AE rate of 39%, a response rate of
49%, a median PFS of 6.5 months, and a median OS of
13.9 months.27 Two other randomized phase 2 trials
failed to demonstrate a benefit with the addition of antiangiogenic agents to chemotherapy in patients with
advanced/metastatic UC (the combination of docetaxel
and vandetanib as second-line therapy; the combination
of gemcitabine, cisplatin, and sorafenib as first-line therapy).28,29 An ongoing phase 2 study is evaluating 2 other
antiangiogenic agents (ramucirumab or icrucumab) with
docetaxel as second-line therapy in patients with
advanced/metastatic UC (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier
NCT01282463).
The report of the patient in the current study who
received open-label sunitinib and that of the patient in the
previously mentioned pazopanib trial with long-term disease control suggest that antiangiogenic therapy may have
efficacy in a small but as-yet undefined subset of patients.
This highlights the importance of identifying appropriate

predictive biomarkers. However, to the best of our
knowledge, to date there is no established predictive biomarker for antiangiogenic therapy in general and sunitinib in particular. Previous reports have suggested the
value of biomarkers that are predictive of response to sunitinib and other antiangiogenic agents.30 A low
interleukin-8 baseline serum level was associated with prolonged TTP, whereas baseline tumor contrast enhancement with > 40 Hounsfield units was associated with
clinical benefit in patients with UC who were receiving
sunitinib.23 Data have suggested that inhibition of
hypoxia-inducible factor-a may be required for a response
to sunitinib in patients with RCC.31
In the current study, the serum VEGF level did not
appear to change significantly with either treatment; variations in the time point of serum collection can affect the
VEGF level, which can regress to a normal range when the
patient is off therapy. However, the serum sVEGFR2 level
significantly decreased during sunitinib therapy and at the
time of disease progression, corresponding to previous
reports. This could be explained by the disruption of vasculature and endothelial cells that express VEGFR2.
Plasma (vs serum) level most likely reflects more accurately circulating VEGF because platelets may contain/
secrete VEGF into the blood, and platelet number can
change during treatment.32 Similar reductions in the serum or plasma sVEGFR2 level and increases in the VEGF
level with sunitinib were reported in patients with UC,
gastrointestinal stromal tumors, and RCC.20,23,33 Larger
changes in plasma VEGF, sVEGFR2, and sVEGFR3 levels were noted in patients who responded to sunitinib versus nonresponders with RCC; in our trial, changes in the
serum VEGF and sVEGFR2 levels from baseline after
cycle 1 did not correlate with outcome. In exploratory
analysis, we found that a baseline serum VEGF level
greater than the median was associated with longer PFS.
This finding should be interpreted with caution due to
the small sample size, but may merit further exploration.
Because of the limitations of the current trial, the
negative results should not preclude future exploration of
other antiangiogenic or alternative maintenance strategies.
It is interesting to note that both lapatinib (anti-epidermal
growth factor receptor/human epidermal growth factor
receptor 2 tyrosine kinase inhibitor) and vinflunine are
currently being tested as maintenance therapies in patients
with metastatic UC (ClinicalTrials.gov identifiers
NCT00949455 and NCT01529411).
Despite the limitations of this randomized trial,
maintenance sunitinib after standard chemotherapy did
not appear to impact disease progression and is unlikely to

confer a benefit in this setting. Sunitinib was found to
have modest activity when initiated at the time of disease
progression. The role of antiangiogenic therapy and the
predictive value of the serum VEGF level in response to
such therapy remain unclear in patients with UC. A better
understanding of de novo and acquired mechanisms of resistance to antiangiogenic therapies in this disease is critically needed to enhance treatment effects and provide
potential predictive biomarkers.
