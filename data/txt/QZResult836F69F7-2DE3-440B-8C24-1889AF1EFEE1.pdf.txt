Abstract
Aromatase inhibitors (AI) are a standard-of-care treatment for postmenopausal, estrogen receptor–positive
breast cancers. Although tumor recurrence on AI therapy occurs, the mechanisms underlying acquired resistance
to AIs remain unknown. In this study, we examined a cohort of endocrine-treated breast cancer patients and used
a cell line model of resistance to the AI letrozole. In patients treated with a ﬁrst-line AI, hormone receptor
switching between primary and resistant tumors was a common feature of disease recurrence. Resistant cells
exhibited a switch from steroid-responsive growth to growth factor–responsive and endocrine-independent
growth, which was accompanied by the development of a more migratory and disorganized phenotype. Both the
resistant cells and tumors from AI-resistant patients showed high expression of the steroid receptor coactivator
SRC-1. Direct interactions between SRC-1 and the transcription factor Ets2 regulated Myc and MMP9. SRC-1 was
required for the aggressive and motile phenotype of AI-resistant cells. Interestingly, SRC-1 expression in primary
and/or recurrent tumors was associated with a reduction in disease-free survival in treated patients. Moreover,
there was a signiﬁcant association between SRC-1 and Ets2 in the recurrent tissue compared with the matched
primary tumor. Together, our ﬁndings elucidate a mechanism of AI-speciﬁc metastatic progression in which
interactions between SRC-1 and Ets2 promote dedifferentiation and migration in hormone-dependent breast
cancer. Cancer Res; 72(2); 548–59. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
Endocrine therapies, including estrogen receptor (ER) modulators and aromatase inhibitors (AI), are ﬁrst-line treatment
for ER-positive breast cancer. The development of third-generation AIs has brought about a major change in the therapeutic approach to patients with hormone-sensitive breast
cancer. A meta-analysis of trials comparing AIs and tamoxifen
for the adjuvant treatment of women with early breast cancer
concluded that AIs should be the treatment of choice in
postmenopausal women (1, 2). AIs, however, do not remove
all of the estrogen ligand—data from molecular and in vivo
studies suggest that this can result in adaptive hypersensitivity
of the intact ER via increased signaling through growth factor
pathways (3). The signiﬁcance of this hypersensitivity and

resultant resistance to the AI therapy will only become evident
as long-term follow-up becomes available.
The development of resistance to endocrine therapy, and
resulting tumor recurrence, is due at least in part to cellular
plasticity leading to a shift in the phenotype of the tumor
cell from steroid dependence to steroid independence/
growth factor dependence. Consequently, the resistant cancer cells may also use steroid receptor–independent
mechanisms to drive tumor progression. Alterations in
steroid receptor proﬁle observed in clinical studies between
primary and metastatic breast cancer, in particular with
loss of progesterone receptor (PR) status, support the
phenomenon of tumor adaptability in endocrine-resistant
patients (4). Furthermore, conversion from serum Her2
negative to positive has been reported as an independent
risk factor for decreased survival in both tamoxifen and AItreated patients (5).
Aberrant expression of the p160 steroid receptor coactivators SRC-1 and SRC-3 (AIB1) in patients has been associated
with resistance to endocrine therapies and the development of
tumor recurrence (6–8). Although initially described as a
nuclear receptor coactivator protein, SRC-1 has been shown
to interact with transcription factors running downstream of
an activated mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. These transcription factor interactions may represent one
of the consequences of growth factor pathway cross-talk
described in endocrine resistance. Functional interactions

SRC-1 Drives Aromatase Inhibitor Resistance

between SRC-1 and the Ets family of transcription factors, Ets2
and PEA3, have previously been reported, and this relationship
has been shown to be important in tumor progression and the
development of metastasis (6, 9, 10).
In this study, negative PR status predicted early disease
recurrence on AI treatment, and loss of steroid receptor
status between matched primary and metastatic tumors was
observed. In a cell model of AI resistance, developed using
the AI letrozole, we found elevated cell migration and loss of
differentiation compared with the parental endocrine sensitive cells. We provide evidence that SRC-1 can drive this
aggressive phenotype by partnering with Ets2 to regulate
expression of Myc and MMP9. Furthermore, elevated SRC-1
expression and functional transcriptional interactions were
observed in AI-speciﬁc metastatic tumors. Taken together,
these data suggest a role for SRC-1 in the steroid-independent adaptation of breast cancer to AI therapy and subsequent disease recurrence.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines, treatments, and transfections
Breast cancer cells MCF-7, MDA-MB231, SKBR3 [American
Type Culture Collection (ATCC)] and LY2 (kind gift from R.
Clarke, Georgetown University, Washington, DC) were grown
as previously described (11). MCF10A cells (ATCC) were cultured in DMEM/F12 with 15 mmol/L hepes buffer, 5% horse
serum, 10 mg/mL insulin, 20 ng/mL EGF, 100 ng/mL choleratoxin, and 0.5 mg/mL hydrocortisone. AI-sensitive (Aro) cells
were generated by stably transfecting MCF-7 cells with the
aromatase gene, CYP19 (pcDNA DEST47 destination vector).
Aro cells were cultured in MEM supplemented with 10% FCS,
1% L-Glutamine, 1% Pen/Strep, and 200 mg/mL Geneticin
(G418, Gibco Invitrogen). Letrozole-resistant (LetR) cells were
generated by long-term (>3 months) culture of Aro cells with
letrozole (106 mol/L; Novartis) and androstenedione (25 
109 mol/L; Sigma Aldrich) in MEM supplemented with 10%
charcoal-dextran-stripped FCS, 1% L-Glutamine, 1% Pen/
Strep, and 200 mg/mL G418. All cells were maintained
in steroid-depleted medium 72 hours prior to treatment
with estradiol (108 mol/L; Sigma Aldrich), androstenedione
(107 mol/L), or letrozole (106 mol/L). SiRNA (Ambion)
directed against SRC-1 (AM16706) and ERa (4392421) were
used to knock down gene expression. The pcDNA3.1 and pCGN
plasmids containing full-length SRC-1 and Ets2, respectively,
were used for overexpression studies. Empty plasmids were
used as a negative control. Plasmids were constructed as
previously described (11). Transfections were carried out using
Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) as per manufacturer's instructions. For the motility assay and the 3-dimensional (3D)
cultures, cells were seeded 72 hours after transfection. All
other experiments were carried out 24 hours after transfection.
Cell motility, cell proliferation, and 3D culture assays
Cellomics Cell Motility Kit (Thermo Scientiﬁc, #K0800011)
was used to assess individual cell movement after 22 hours as
per manufacturer's instructions using cells seeded at 1  104
cells/mL. Mean track areas (minimum of 90 cell tracks per

www.aacrjournals.org

condition) were analyzed with Olympus cell imaging software
and compared with a Student t test.
For proliferation, Aro and LetR cells were steroid depleted
for 72 hours and seeded into 6-well plates at a density of 0.5 
104 cells per well. The cells were serum starved for a further
24 hours before being treated with vehicle (acetic acid; 0.01%),
androstenedione (100 nmol/L), or EGF (1 ng/mL) for 72 hours.
Cells were stained with crystal violet solution (Cruinn), dissolved in 33% glacial acetic acid, and the absorbance measured
at 620 nm using a plate reader (Greiner).
For 3D assays, 5  104 cells in 400 mL of their respective
medium (as above) and 2% Matrigel (BD Biosciences) were
seeded onto the growth factor reduced matrigel matrix in 8
well-chamber slides (BD Biosciences) and cultured for
14 days at 37 C/5% CO2. Cells were ﬁxed in 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with PBS containing 0.5% Triton
X-100 for 10 minutes at 4 C. Cells were blocked in 10% goat
serum, 1% bovine serum albumin. Cells were stained
with Phalloidin 594 (Molecular Probes) for 20 minutes and
40 ,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) for 5 minutes. Alternatively, cells were stained with rat anti-human B1-integrin
antibody (552828, BD Transduction Laboratories) followed
by goat anti-rat 633 secondary antibody (Alexa-Fluor) and
DAPI. Slides were mounted (Dako) and examined by confocal microscopy.
Zymography
Aro and LetR cells were seeded in a 6-well plate, and media
were collected 24 hours later. Protein was concentrated with
Amicon Ultra4 ﬁlters (50 K pore size, Millipore). Twenty
micrograms of protein was loaded onto a 10% Gelatin Zymogram Gel (Invitrogen) and run according to the manufacturer's
instructions. The gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue
and destained until bands were visible. Pro (92 kDa) and active
(82 kDa) MMP9 bands were identiﬁed by size (12, 13).
Next-generation sequencing
SRC-1 ChIP sequencing (vehicle and tamoxifen-treated LY2
cells) and RNA sequencing (tamoxifen-treated LY2 cells) were
carried out using the Illumina Genome Analyzer System as
previously described (11).
Coimmunoprecipitation and Western blotting
Protein was immunoprecipitated with mouse anti–SRC-1
and blotted for SRC-1 and Ets2. Western blotting was carried
out as previously described (14). Primary antibodies used
were rabbit anti-human Ets2 (1:250, sc-351, Santa Cruz),
rabbit anti-human SRC-1 (1:100, sc-8995, Santa Cruz), rabbit
anti-human Myc (1:200, sc-788, Santa Cruz), mouse antihuman ERa (1:500, sc-8002, Santa Cruz) or b-actin (1:7,500;
Sigma-Aldrich).
Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay and PCR
Aro and LetR cells were treated with vehicle, estrogen,
androstenedione, letrozole or androstenedione and letrozole
for 45 minutes, and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)
analysis was carried out as previously described (14). Cell
lysates were quantiﬁed after shearing using a Nanodrop

(Thermo Scientiﬁc) to ensure equal starting material in each
sample. The following antibodies were incubated overnight at
4 C with rotation: 6 mg rabbit anti-human Ets2 (sc-351, Santa
Cruz), 6 mg rabbit anti-human SRC-1 (sc-8995, Santa Cruz), 6 mg
rabbit immunoglobulin G (IgG) as a negative control or 7 mL
antiacetylated H4 (Millipore) as a positive control. Reverse
cross-linking and DNA recovery were carried out with Chelex
100 (Bio-Rad). Real-time PCR was carried out in duplicate by
SYBR Green PCR (Qiagen) using a Lightcycler (Roche), and
primers are listed in Supplementary Table S1. Semiquantitative
reverse-transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) was carried out using
primers listed in Supplementary Table S1.
Patient information and construction of tissue
microarray
Patient breast tumor samples were collected and data
recorded as previously described (15). Data included pathologic characteristics (tumor stage, grade, lymph node status,
ER status, recurrence) and treatment with radiotherapy, chemotherapy, tamoxifen, or AIs. Detailed follow-up data (median,
56 months) were collected on the patients to determine
disease-free survival. Tissue microarray (TMA) construction
was conducted as previously described (15).
Immunohistochemistry
Breast tissue and TMA sections were deparafﬁnized and
incubated with rabbit anti-human SRC-1 (2 mg/mL; Santa
Cruz); rabbit anti-human Myc (2 mg/mL; Santa Cruz),
mouse anti-human MMP9 (2 mg/mL; Santa Cruz) or control
IgG for 1 hour at room temperature. The slides were then
incubated with the corresponding biotin-labeled secondary
(0.5% in PBS; Vector Laboratories) for 30 minutes, followed
by peroxidase-labeled avidin biotin complex (Vector Laboratories) for 30 minutes. Sections were developed in 3,3diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride for 2 minutes and
counterstained with hematoxylin for 3 minutes, then
passed through increasing concentrations of Industrial
Methylated Spirits (70% and 100%) and then xylene. The
immunostained TMA slides were scored using the Allred
scoring system (16). Independent observers, without knowledge of prognostic factors, scored slides. Univariate statistical analysis was carried out using Fisher exact test for
categorical variables and Wilcoxon test for continuous
variables.
Immunoﬂuorescent microscopy and quantitative
colocalization
Cell lines, grown on collagen coated coverslips, were ﬁxed
and permeabilized as per the 3D assay. Cells were blocked
with 10% goat serum for 1 hour, incubated with rabbit antihuman SRC-1 antibody (Santa Cruz) followed by goat antirabbit 488 (Molecular Probes), phalloidin for 20 minutes, and
DAPI for 5 minutes. Tumor sections were blocked in 10%
goat serum for 1 hour, incubated with rabbit anti-human
phospho-Ets2 (10 mg/mL in 10% human serum; Invitrogen)
for 1.5 hours, and then Alexa 594 conjugated goat anti-rabbit
antibody (1/200; Molecular Probes) for 1 hour. Sections were
blocked again with goat serum for 1 hour, then incubated

with mouse anti-human SRC-1 (10 mg/mL in 10% human
serum; Upstate) for 1.5 hours, followed by a 1-hour
incubation with Alexa 488 conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (1/200; Molecular Probes). Sections were mounted
using ﬂuorescent mounting media (DAKO). Slides were
examined under a Zeiss LSM 510 META confocal ﬂuorescent
microscope with the 40 objective lens (1.40 NA). Quantitative colocalization analyses (minimum 9 images per sample) were carried out with Zeiss 510 META Software using
the Pearson correlation coefﬁcient, R(r) (17).

Results
AI resistance is characterized by hormone receptor
switching and a more motile and disorganized
phenotype
Endocrine resistance is thought to involve, at least in part,
a switch from steroid signaling to growth factor signaling,
leading to a steroid-independent tumor (18). In keeping with
this hypothesis, we identiﬁed a signiﬁcant association
between lack of PR expression in the primary tumor and
reduced early response speciﬁcally to AI treatments (Fig. 1A,
P ¼ 0.02 at 2-year follow-up; Supplementary Fig. S1A). In
addition, analysis of patients with matched primary and AIresistant tumors highlighted that hormone receptor status
regularly switched between primary and subsequent tumors.
In particular, a trend for loss of ER and PR expression and
occasional gain of Her2 expression were observed (Fig. 1B).
Analysis of a cell model system with AI sensitive (Aro) and
AI-resistant (LetR) cells was also in keeping with this
hypothesis of a signaling switch. Resistant cells, although
they had slightly elevated expression of ERa (Fig. 1C),
showed a reduced proliferative response to estrogen and
an increased proliferative response to EGF compared with
sensitive cells (Fig. 1D).
To further characterize the AI-resistant phenotype, migratory assays and 3D culture assays were carried out. The
migratory assay identiﬁed a signiﬁcant increase in motility
between resistant cells and sensitive cells (approximately 5fold; Fig. 1E). As expected, the high motility of the resistant
cells was not signiﬁcantly affected by either steroid or AI
treatment (Supplementary Fig. S1B). Consistent with the
increased motility of LetR cells, increased levels of the
matrix metalloproteinase MMP9 were also detected in these
resistant cells compared with sensitive cells (both mRNA
and levels of the secreted active MMP9 protein; Fig. 1F). In
3D culture assays, sensitive cells were capable of organizing
into circular, hollow structures, similar to the highly organized acini of MCF10A cells (Fig. 1G). Resistant cells, by
contrast, were more disorganized; failed to form round,
hollow, polarized spheres; and were more comparable with
the disorganized endocrine insensitive SKBR3 cells (Fig. 1G
and Supplementary Fig. S1C). The increased migration and
decreased polarization of AI-resistant cells is consistent with
a metastatic phenotype. Combined, these results provide
evidence of hormone receptor switching as an important
feature involved in the development of an aggressive AIresistant phenotype.

SRC-1 Drives Aromatase Inhibitor Resistance

between Aro and LetR cells. SRC-1, Ets2, phospho-Ets2, and
Myc expression was higher in resistant cells compared with
sensitive Aro or parental MCF7 cells (Fig. 2B). To assess
regulation of expression of these proteins both Aro and
LetR cells were treated with estrogen and androstenedione
in the presence or absence of letrozole (Fig. 2C). In Aro
cells, expression of SRC-1 and Myc was increased in
response to both estrogen and androstenedione. Letrozole
inhibited this response to androstenedione, conﬁrming
the sensitivity of Aro cells to AIs (Fig. 2C, left). In LetR
cells, expression of SRC-1 and Myc was higher than in Aro
cells and increased further in response to androstenedione.
This increase was not inhibited by the presence of letrozole
(Fig. 2C, right). Consistent with these observations, immunoﬂuorescent staining identiﬁed increased nuclear localization of SRC-1 in Aro cells treated with androstenedione
compared with all other treated Aro cells. Strong nuclear
localization of SRC-1 was observed in all LetR cells
independent of treatments (Fig. 2D). Ets2 protein expression was not altered by steroid treatments, but its expression was constitutively higher in LetR cells than in Aro
cells (Fig. 2C). Thus, expression of SRC-1 and Myc seems
to have become dysregulated in the LetR model of AI
resistance.
Coimmunoprecipitation analysis revealed that SRC-1
and Ets2 can interact after 45 minutes of steroid treatment
(Fig. 3A). ChIP studies were therefore carried out using
this time point to investigate the potential recruitment of
SRC-1 and Ets2 to the Myc and MMP9 promoters. Though
MMP9 was not highlighted by the ChIP sequencing study,
owing to the undetectable levels of MMP9 expression in
the endocrine-resistant LY2 cells used for this analysis,
bioinformatic analysis did identify both Ets and E2F-binding motifs within the proximal MMP9 promoter. ChIP
analysis conﬁrmed that both SRC-1 and Ets2 were
recruited to the promoters of Myc and MMP9 target genes
in Aro and LetR cells (Fig. 3B). In AI-sensitive Aro cells,
SRC-1 and Ets2 recruitment to the promoters was driven
by steroids and inhibited by letrozole treatment, as conﬁrmed by real-time PCR (Fig. 3B). By contrast, in the
resistant LetR cells, SRC-1 and Ets2 were recruited to the
target gene promoters independent of steroid treatment,
and this recruitment was not inhibited by the presence of
letrozole (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, overexpression of either
SRC-1 or Ets2 in Aro cells resulted in increased mRNA
expression of both Myc and MMP9 target genes (Fig. 3C
and D). The increased transcript levels of MMP9 did not
translate into increased levels of secreted MMP9 protein,
suggesting that mechanisms other than SRC-1 or Ets2 may
be important in the posttranslational modiﬁcation and
secretion of MMP9. Finally, Ets2 overexpression in LetR
cells resulted in increased Myc and MMP9 transcript
expression, and concomitant knockdown of SRC-1 using
siRNA inhibited the increase (Fig. 3E). Combined, these
results suggest that SRC-1 can interact with the transcription factor Ets2 to regulate expression of Myc and MMP9
and that this signaling pathway is dysregulated in AI
resistance.

SRC-1 is required for the motile, disorganized phenotype
of AI-resistant cells
To assess the functional role of the SRC-1 driven signaling
pathway in AI resistance, SRC-1 was knocked down in LetR
cells using siRNA. Reduced SRC-1 expression resulted in a
signiﬁcantly reduced ability of these cells to migrate (P ¼
0.0007), returning the LetR cells to a migratory phenotype
comparable with that of the AI-sensitive Aro cells (Fig. 4A).
Furthermore, the LetR cells with SRC-1 knockdown were
capable of forming more organized 3D acini in a manner
comparable with the AI-sensitive Aro cells (Fig. 4B).
Previous reports have indicated that SRC-1, although named
as a nuclear receptor coactivator, may interact with other
transcription factors such as Ets2, as shown here. In line
with these ﬁndings, ERa knockdown had a minimal effect on
migration (Fig. 4C). The signiﬁcantly greater impact of SRC-1
on migration in comparison with ERa (P ¼ 0.0377, Fig. 4C)
supports a steroid-independent mechanism for SRC-1 in driving AI-mediated metastasis.
SRC-1 is signiﬁcantly associated with disease recurrence
in AI-treated patients
To examine the signiﬁcance of the SRC-1 signaling pathway in the clinical setting, a tissue microarray was constructed with primary breast tumors from 150 patients who
received endocrine therapy, 84 of whom received an AI and
75 of whom received tamoxifen. Median follow-up on these
patients was 56 months. SRC-1 protein expression was
signiﬁcantly associated with poor disease-free survival in
the total endocrine-treated population (P ¼ 0.0255, Fig. 5A
and Supplementary Fig. S1A) and the tamoxifen-treated
population (P ¼ 0.0326, Fig. 5B) but not in the AI-treated
population (P ¼ 0.6894, Fig. 5B). SRC-1 also was associated
with recurrence (independent of time to recurrence) in the
tamoxifen-treated (P ¼ 0.015) and total endocrine-treated
(P ¼ 0.009) populations but not the AI-treated (P ¼ 0.494)
population (Table 1). No associations were observed
between SRC-1 expression and PR, Her2 or nodal status.
However, a highly signiﬁcant association was observed
between SRC-1 and advanced tumor stage in both the
endocrine-treated population (P ¼ 0.003) and speciﬁcally
within the AI-treated population (P ¼ 0.001, Table 1). This
association suggests that although SRC-1 may not be useful
as a predictor of response to treatment, it may play an
important role in mediating the metastatic phenotype of AI
resistance.
Among the patients who displayed AI resistance (n ¼ 9),
only 3 primary tumors were scored as SRC-1 negative.
Matched-resistant tumor tissue was collected for all 3 of
these patients, and paired primary and resistant tumors
were stained for SRC-1 protein expression. In each case,
the resistant tumor tissue was SRC-1 positive (representative
images shown in Fig. 5C). This ﬁnding is consistent with the
proposed role of SRC-1 in mediating the metastatic phenotype of AI resistance. Indeed, expression of SRC-1 in either
the primary or resistant tumor of AI-treated patients
revealed a signiﬁcant correlation between SRC-1 expression
and reduced disease-free survival (P ¼ 0.0106, Kaplan–

signaling pathway in mediating the aggressive phenotype of
AI resistance and metastasis.

Discussion
The development of resistance to AI therapy is marked by a
shift in cancer cell status from steroid dependent to steroid
independent/growth factor dependent. Recent clinical studies
of advanced breast cancer have revealed that PR expression is
associated with increased time to AI treatment failure (21),
suggesting that a move away from steroid signaling may mark
the emergence of a more aggressive phenotype. Consistent
with this, we observed an association between PR-negative
status in the primary tumor and increased early disease
recurrence on ﬁrst-line AI treatment. Furthermore, there was
a signiﬁcant loss of steroid receptor status in metastatic tumor
tissue in comparison with the matched primary tumor in AI-

556

treated patients. In the LetR cell line model, a slight increase in
ERa expression was observed, consistent with the model of
long-term letrozole treatment (22). However, we also observed
an enhanced proliferative response to EGF in cells resistant to
AIs, in comparison with the parental sensitive phenotype,
indicating increased reliance on growth factor signaling pathways. The ability of AI-resistant tumors to alter their receptor
status and increase sensitivity to growth factor pathways may
be a consequence of increased cellular plasticity leading to the
development of a steroid-independent phenotype.
Several cell model systems of AI resistance have been
described in the literature, including the long-term estrogen
deprived (LTED) model and an estrogen withdrawal breast
cancer cell line overexpressing aromatase (UMB-1Ca). Where
the former model displays increased sensitivity to estrogen not
observed in the UMB-1Ca cells, both models show increased
sensitivity to growth factor signaling (23, 24). In this study,
LetR cells displayed a reduced proliferative response to steroid
treatment and an increased sensitivity to growth factors in

comparison with the parental endocrine sensitive cells.
Similar elevations in growth factor signaling activity have
previously been reported in models of resistance to both
letrozole and anastrozole (25). Recently, Chen reported that
growth factor/signal transduction pathways are upregulated
after ERa-dependent pathways are suppressed by letrozole,
anastrozole, and exemestane, and ERa can then be activated
through different cross-talk mechanisms (26). Increased tumor
plasticity occurs in endocrine-resistant breast cancer relative
to endocrine-sensitive tumors (11). This is evident in our model
of AI resistance, where a decrease in cellular differentiation and
a concomitant increase in cell migration were observed. Moreover, alterations in migratory patterns were accompanied by
increased activity of the metalloproteinase MMP9. These
observations of a more aggressive phenotype are consistent
with increased levels of invasion in AI-resistant models
reported by Belosay and colleagues (22).
Aberrant expression of the p160 steroid receptor coactivators SRC-1 and SRC-3 (AIB1) in patients has been
associated with resistance to endocrine therapies and the
development of tumor recurrence (6–8, 27, 28). Unlike

other oncogenes, recent studies provide evidence of a
speciﬁc role for SRC-1 in the development of metastasis
(29, 30). Of interest, knockdown of SRC-1 can decrease cell
proliferation, restore differentiation, and decrease migration in tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer cells (11). A
steroid-independent role for SRC-1 has been established,
and the coactivator has been shown to interact with
transcription factors running downstream of an activated
MAPK pathway. This group and others have reported
functional interactions between SRC-1 and the Ets family
of transcription factors, Ets2 and PEA3, and shown that
this relationship is important in tumor progression and
the development of metastasis (9, 10, 31). In the ERnegative PyMT SRC-1 knockout mouse model, SRC-1,
though not required for mammary tumor initiation, is
essential for the development of metastatic disease. This
occurs in part through SRC-1–mediated TWIST suppressing luminal markers such as E-cadherin and b-catenin
during epithelial–mesenchymal transition (10). Here, we
show that SRC-1 can use Ets2 to regulate the production
of Myc and MMP9. The production of both the oncogene

and metalloproteinase was dysregulated in AI resistance,
where treatment of the resistant cells with letrozole failed
to prevent recruitment of SRC-1 and Ets2 to the promoters
of Myc and MMP9 or inhibit their production. Moreover,
at a functional level, knockdown of SRC-1 restored cellular
differentiation and reduced cell migration in the AI-resistant cells. In line with SRC-1 mediating the metastatic
phenotype through steroid-independent mechanisms,
knockdown of ERa had no signiﬁcant effect on AI-resistant cell migration.
Expression of SRC-1 in the primary tumor is an independent predictor of poor response to tamoxifen treatment
in breast cancer patients (6, 8). Despite this, in patients
treated ﬁrst line with AI therapies, SRC-1 was not a
signiﬁcant predictor of response to treatment, suggesting
that different mechanisms may be important in the initiation of resistance to tamoxifen in comparison with AI
therapy. From our patient population that suffered a tumor
recurrence on AI treatment, two thirds expressed SRC-1 in
the primary tumor. Those patients whose primary tumor
was negative for SRC-1, however, all had an SRC-1–positive
tumor recurrence. This switch from SRC-1 negative to
positive in the recurrent tissue echoes the loss of steroid
receptor status that can be observed in AI-resistant
patients. Furthermore, a signiﬁcant increase in functional

558

Cancer Res; 72(2) January 15, 2012

associations between the coactivator and Ets2, together
with an increase in Myc and MMP9, were also found in the
recurrent tumor compared with the matched primary
patient tumor tissue. Taken together, these data indicate
the signiﬁcance of SRC-1 in advancing the metastatic
phenotype in AI-resistant patients.
Increased tumor plasticity can enable endocrinesensitive tumors to adapt to therapy through the promotion of growth factor signaling. In this study, we provide
evidence that SRC-1 can play a signiﬁcant role in driving
AI-related tumor metastasis through the regulation of
dedifferentiation and promigratory pathways. Understanding the mechanisms of how tumors can turn off and on key
signaling networks in response to AI treatment will enable
new strategies to be developed to detect and treat metastatic disease.
